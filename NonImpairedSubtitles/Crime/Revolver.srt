1
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:20,243
One thing I've learned in the last seven years,

2
00:01:20,287 --> 00:01:25,645
in every game and con there is always
an opponent and there is always a victim.

3
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:32,085
The trick is to know when you're the latter,
so you can become the former.

4
00:01:52,407 --> 00:01:54,921
How deep did you bury that shareholder, Paul?

5
00:01:55,927 --> 00:01:57,918
Deep.

6
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:02,802
Are you sure this is a good idea?

7
00:02:02,847 --> 00:02:04,758
He has to pay us something, doesn't he?

8
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:07,719
But you've got more money
than you could ever spend.

9
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:09,917
That's all you think about nowadays.

10
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:11,958
He owes me and he owes you.

11
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,998
Now he has to pay.

12
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:16,038
It's cause and effect.

13
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:18,036
Sorry, sir, this table is closed.

14
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:20,606
Send him up.

15
00:03:20,647 --> 00:03:24,162
I'm not sure that's a good idea, Mr D.
He's got better. I mean, a lot better.

16
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:25,606
All the tables are closed.

17
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:32,038
Send him up, Paul.

18
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:38,325
20.

19
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:40,358
Hold on.

20
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:42,443
I think we'll take the stairs, eh, Billy?

21
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:44,364
You want to walk 20 flights, Jake?

22
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:45,760
Don't be silly.

23
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:48,879
I don't like to feel trapped. Never did, never will.

24
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:53,079
Why should a man
do what he doesn't like to do?

25
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:58,245
Jake, if you want to take the stairs,
we'll take the stairs...

26
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:01,404
There's always a choice.
What's wrong with the stairs?

27
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:05,440
Come on, you'll be all right.

28
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:25,327
I've got to spend the next two minutes

29
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:30,157
shaking and sweating like a crack whore
clucking for a fix.

30
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:37,521
Should have taken the stairs,
cos it's getting very, very tight in here.

31
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,806
I'm afraid it's only two at the table, Mr Green.

32
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:02,238
Freddy, you're done.

33
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:08,644
Have a seat, Mr Green.

34
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,555
I hear you've done very well for yourself...

35
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:15,364
...and against all the odds.

36
00:05:15,407 --> 00:05:19,002
They do say, the harder the battle
the sweeter the victory.

37
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:23,923
A wise man once told me
there's only one rule in this world,

38
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:27,276
a small question that drives all success.

39
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:33,880
The more a man invests in that question,
the more powerful that man will become.

40
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:37,601
Can you guess what that question is, Mr Green?

41
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:44,004
What's in it for me?

42
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:50,526
I've been warned
if I let you sit down at this table I might regret it.

43
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:54,724
They say you've become
very ambitious in your maturing,

44
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:57,918
and you now wish to acquire yourself
a business,

45
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:01,162
a business like my business?

46
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:03,596
But we both know what you are, don't we, Jake?

47
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:08,163
You're a man who needs a master.
You're an employee.

48
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:10,198
So, what's in it for me?

49
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:15,041
The pleasure of doing an old employee a favour,

50
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:19,638
by reminding him of the position
nature chose for him.

51
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:23,076
Rade, how much have you got?

52
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:25,924
What's that got to do with you?

53
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,356
Toss you for it.

54
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:32,276
He's got you there, Rade.

55
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:37,879
It's not worth a heart attack. Get on with it.

56
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,435
I'll toss you for a tenth.

57
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:47,162
You're a risk-taker of the highest calibre,
ain't you, Rade?

58
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,078
I'll take red.

59
00:06:57,287 --> 00:07:02,407
Very impressive, Mr Green.
You've honed those talents most skilfully.

60
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:05,041
Pay the man his money, Billy.

61
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:06,918
Should have bet the whole lot, Rade.

62
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:10,476
You have to teach me that trick sometime.

63
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,198
You're on.

64
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,280
I'll toss you for everything under your chin.

65
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:27,115
There isn't a problem is there, Mr D?

66
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:32,523
You've got a big mouth on a small head,
sunshine.

67
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:36,364
Be my guest.

68
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:39,119
I'll take purple.

69
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,158
You're on.

70
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:45,963
It's a lovely colour, purple,

71
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:50,956
discretely sandwiched within
the colour spectrum between blue and white.

72
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:53,722
Always a royal winner.

73
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:03,242
Billy, do the honours.

74
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:06,795
Don't you fucking move.

75
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:11,442
Don't let your mouth put you in more trouble
than your body could handle.

76
00:08:11,487 --> 00:08:15,082
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll exercise a bit of charity.

77
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,322
Double or quits?

78
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:27,123
You're on.

79
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,076
Come on.

80
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:36,039
Mr Green, Mr Macha would appreciate it
if you came back to the table.

81
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:40,518
I haven't finished with him yet.

82
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:45,358
Now would be a good time.

83
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:49,042
I think it's time to fly, don't you, Jake?

84
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:56,438
- Excuse me.
- We're coming through here.

85
00:08:56,487 --> 00:09:00,002
Relax. You're in trouble, Mr Green.
We could help.

86
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:03,038
Thank you.

87
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:09,480
I take the stairs.

88
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:23,318
He got lucky, Mr D, that's all.

89
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:25,358
Fuck luck, the man's a danger.

90
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,717
Since he's been out, he's made a fortune, Mr D.
He's fat and comfortable.

91
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:32,157
He's got what he wanted.
I'm sure we won't be hearing from him again.

92
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:35,483
He ate seven years, Paul.
Seven years doesn't taste nice.

93
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:38,519
Not to mention the accident
with his brother's wife.

94
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:45,680
And what the fuck does
"I haven't finished with him yet" mean?

95
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,958
Get rid of him.

96
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:55,958
And I don't want any mistakes.

97
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:59,397
No crackheads with sharp sticks
acting like silly fucking gangsters.

98
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:03,645
You take Sorter and Slim Biggins.
You do it quickly, you do it quietly.

99
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:06,515
We don't know what caused the blackout.

100
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:11,243
But we've run some blood tests
and we'll have the results within a few hours.

101
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:15,364
It's a miracle
you didn't sustain any damage from your fall.

102
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:16,806
Can I go now?

103
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:18,917
Once you've put your clothes back on.

104
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:21,037
We'll call you back with the results.

105
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:24,322
All right, look, I'll take your man back.

106
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:27,358
Billy. You go home.

107
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:29,398
It's late.

108
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,558
Go easy now, yeah?

109
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:15,717
Joe.

110
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:16,517
Joe.

111
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:18,762
Jake. Move.
- Joe.

112
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:20,445
Move. Get the hell out of here.

113
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:30,404
Al, drive the fucking car.

114
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:32,961
Sit down and hold on.

115
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,280
Get in the car.

116
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:48,320
If I wanted you dead,
I would have shot you already.

117
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:54,886
Sit back and be quiet.

118
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,358
What?

119
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:11,204
He missed?

120
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:15,327
Sorter never fucking misses.

121
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:18,040
I don't know what happened.

122
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:20,282
Something went wrong.

123
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:22,318
I had him in my sights...

124
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:23,880
three times.

125
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:28,197
You never miss, let alone three times.

126
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:31,522
Somebody told him we was coming.

127
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:37,242
Something is very wrong here.

128
00:13:37,287 --> 00:13:39,403
Yeah, something's fucking wrong all right.

129
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:42,238
Don't make me angry, Slim.

130
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:47,525
I might have missed him,
but I ain't going to miss you, not at this range.

131
00:13:50,327 --> 00:13:52,318
Maybe it's better you just drive.

132
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:59,998
Doreen, Mr Green. Mr Green, Doreen.

133
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,958
Good morning, Mr Green.

134
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:08,118
Avi, Mr Green.

135
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:11,204
Mr Green, Avi.

136
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:13,124
Sit down.

137
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:21,918
I gather you're quite the player?

138
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:27,606
I'm a bit of an enthusiast myself.
I thought maybe we could have a few games.

139
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:30,923
I think you should tell me what is going on,
don't you?

140
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,840
We have your medical results from the hospital.

141
00:14:35,887 --> 00:14:38,640
It's not important how we got them.

142
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:42,726
What is important, however,
is what it has to say.

143
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:50,316
You will die within three days
from a very unpleasant ailment

144
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,676
that contaminates your blood and organs.

145
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:03,442
Thanks, fellas.
I'll get back to you on this one, yeah?

146
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:07,004
Mr Green.

147
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:10,959
30 seconds, and you can be on your way.

148
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:13,885
The longer you listen, the sweeter the pitch.

149
00:15:13,927 --> 00:15:15,758
30 seconds?

150
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:30,760
We've already saved your life once.
The next time will not be for free.

151
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:34,521
We shall assist you under two conditions.

152
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,127
These conditions are not negotiable.

153
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,965
Oh, I'm being grafted.

154
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:41,360
Condition one.

155
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:45,958
We will bleed you dry.

156
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:49,443
You have to put on a better shirt
before you bleed me dry, my friend.

157
00:15:49,487 --> 00:15:53,082
You will give us every penny you have got.

158
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:55,402
This is a con.

159
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:58,883
It's only natural that you think that
you are somehow being conned,

160
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:02,556
but think a little harder,
and you will realise that this is not a trick.

161
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:05,405
Now, condition two.

162
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:10,281
You will do as we tell you without argument.

163
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:15,685
This includes
answering any questions that are asked.

164
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:21,165
You don't have a lot of time,
and, in reality, you don't have a choice.

165
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:26,926
Now, the most sensible thing to do
would be to get a second opinion.

166
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:29,958
Macha has unleashed his legions.

167
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:33,238
We can protect you from the dangers you face.
That is our deal.

168
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:39,922
You have three hours to decide.
After that, you will be beyond our help.

169
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:42,845
Think I'm going to part with
my hard-earned cash

170
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:45,117
for a set of home-made hospital results?

171
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:47,158
I don't think so.

172
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,084
Not today.

173
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:06,042
I don't have good news, I'm afraid, Mr Green.

174
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:10,000
They've thought this one through all right.
Oh, they're smart.

175
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:13,278
Smart as a pair of a little boy's shoes.

176
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:16,318
She has to be in on it.

177
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:18,358
That's how they got the results.

178
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:21,285
Got to find someone they couldn't have got to.

179
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:24,602
Well, Jake...

180
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:32,558
I'm sorry, there's...

181
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:34,598
there's no easy way to tell you this.

182
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:38,083
You have a rare blood disease.

183
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:44,358
How did they get to him?

184
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:47,164
He's in on it.

185
00:17:48,007 --> 00:17:49,486
After a few days I think...

186
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:53,445
- How much did they pay you?
- What? Who?

187
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:54,522
How much?

188
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:57,286
What are you talking about?
I have no idea what you mean.

189
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,080
You've got five seconds. Five...

190
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:02,561
I have no idea what you're talking about.

191
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:04,359
- Four...
- Wh...? I...

192
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:06,716
- Three... Two...
- I don't know what you mean.

193
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:08,405
God. No, no.

194
00:18:09,447 --> 00:18:13,122
When you're winning,
who thinks about losing?

195
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:16,955
But when you're faced with what I'm looking at,

196
00:18:17,007 --> 00:18:20,636
a new and cold reality dawns.

197
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,516
A fact we like to ignore.

198
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:28,127
You can not win.

199
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:31,921
The only prize they guarantee
when you play this game

200
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:33,958
is that you will lose.

201
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:38,561
It's only a question of when.

202
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:43,798
I made a mistake.

203
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:48,637
You never miss,
so why now and why three times?

204
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:53,922
I had a bad feeling.

205
00:18:56,807 --> 00:18:58,843
"Feeling?"

206
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:04,046
I'm not sure if I paid you to have feelings,
now, did I, Sorter?

207
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:09,319
I paid you
because you're the best in the business.

208
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:13,963
Why would you let feelings
confuse that relationship?

209
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:16,918
Listen to me.

210
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:21,084
Urgency has become something of an issue.

211
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:24,517
So if you could restrain those feelings

212
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:30,437
until you've completed the mission,
I would be most grateful.

213
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,237
Do you think you could do that for me?

214
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:36,164
Sure.

215
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:38,198
I'd appreciate it.

216
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:59,201
If there is one thing I have learnt
about experts, they're experts on fuck all.

217
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:05,037
If there's a rule, you can bend it.
If there's a law, it can be broken.

218
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:13,806
From now on, I am breaking all the rules,
because desperate men do desperate deeds.

219
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,761
Cash just seems to remain king, doesn't it?

220
00:20:19,207 --> 00:20:21,801
New bills. Not too many of them in this town.

221
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,444
I love a new bill.

222
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:36,797
Represents so much hope.
Look how clean and stiff it is.

223
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:40,917
It even smells proud.

224
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:45,279
Your work starts now. You'll be driving.

225
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:55,444
We are, and I apologise for the
unnecessarily dramatic moniker, loan sharks.

226
00:20:55,487 --> 00:21:00,197
People hate and fear us,
just like you will learn to hate and fear us.

227
00:21:00,247 --> 00:21:02,363
We know how much you love a dollar bill,

228
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:06,525
and it won't be easy watching them
fall through your hands,

229
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:09,559
because it will be your money
that we will be loaning.

230
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:21,598
Don't say a word.

231
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:25,559
Just hold the bag
and if we nod, leave it on the table.

232
00:21:26,647 --> 00:21:28,638
There's nothing left.

233
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:33,720
That's a very sad story, Mr Horowitz.
My sympathies are with you and your colleague.

234
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:37,999
Maybe I am being conned,
maybe I am being fooled.

235
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:42,245
Excuse us for having to know
the reason for your loan,

236
00:21:42,287 --> 00:21:45,006
but we have to assess our clients very carefully.

237
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:49,723
They say the sentence has been passed,
the certificate signed, so what's the point?

238
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,964
The point is, this is the only option.

239
00:21:57,727 --> 00:22:01,800
If you snap those fingers at me again,
I'll fucking break 'em.

240
00:22:05,087 --> 00:22:07,123
You know our rates, right?

241
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,240
And our policies?

242
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:15,279
No offence, gentlemen,
but you have a reputation.

243
00:22:18,327 --> 00:22:20,841
I wouldn't be speaking to you if I had a choice.

244
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:31,406
It's a strange thing,
but I still don't like to give it away.

245
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:38,365
I know I can't take it with me, so why the pain?

246
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:41,881
Why the fuck does it still hurt?

247
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:54,719
And greasing the sheaths of these two pricks
isn't making it any easier.

248
00:23:07,367 --> 00:23:09,517
We need to know your history with Macha.

249
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:12,683
How much of it?

250
00:23:12,727 --> 00:23:15,161
All of it.

251
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:24,316
Macha had these three clowns working for him
called the three Eddies.

252
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:26,403
Flash, loud, proud and stupid.

253
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:30,486
They were looking after these shitty little games
going on all over the city.

254
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:34,486
They were wild and dangerous,
but if you won they paid well.

255
00:23:34,527 --> 00:23:38,042
Macha had lost his card man
just before a big game.

256
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:42,603
Anyway they knew I could play,
so they wanted me to take his place.

257
00:23:42,647 --> 00:23:45,798
Like any man who was thinking, I refused.

258
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:48,645
So they started to lean on
my brother and his family.

259
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:51,042
He'd just had a little girl at the time and...

260
00:23:52,047 --> 00:23:54,277
...the whole situation was getting messy.

261
00:23:54,327 --> 00:23:57,478
# How many legs has daddy long-legs got?

262
00:23:57,527 --> 00:24:01,042
So, for the sake of keeping the peace,
I rolled over and agreed to play.

263
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:03,123
I won, and I was done.

264
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:05,158
That's very good, Mr Green,

265
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:09,564
but tell me, does your mum...
from a donkey?

266
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:14,404
Then some cowboy starts mouthing off.

267
00:24:14,447 --> 00:24:16,358
I wasn't having any of that shit.

268
00:24:16,407 --> 00:24:18,318
I'm not having any of that shit.

269
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:22,398
I've got a funny one for you too, George.

270
00:24:22,447 --> 00:24:25,837
Very funny, George.
This one will make you laugh.

271
00:24:26,607 --> 00:24:32,398
Next thing you know, it's a gunfight,
people get hurt and money disappears.

272
00:24:32,447 --> 00:24:36,156
Two weeks later, someone drops my name
and I'm being questioned.

273
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:40,644
The Eddies thought I might talk,
so they threatened my brother's daughter.

274
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:44,316
The mother reacted badly, like they do
when their little ones are in danger.

275
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:47,518
They got into a fight
and she took an angry stray bullet.

276
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:51,321
My brother lost his wife
and his daughter lost her mother.

277
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:54,444
I lost my sense of humour and seven years

278
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:58,036
because I wouldn't tell the authorities
that Macha had organised the games.

279
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:03,759
Sometime after that,
the Eddies upset Macha in some way,

280
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:08,801
so he had them used as aggregate and mixed
into some concrete on one of his buildings.

281
00:25:10,687 --> 00:25:13,724
Macha had to pay something, didn't he?

282
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:20,446
And I know nothing hurts more than humiliation
and a little money loss.

283
00:25:26,807 --> 00:25:28,798
I employ hundreds of people.

284
00:25:28,847 --> 00:25:30,838
They have to be paid tomorrow.

285
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:34,276
We need three more days.

286
00:25:34,327 --> 00:25:36,045
Try to understand.

287
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:42,798
What did I sign up for?

288
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:48,717
Don't try to make sense out of it, not now,
cos it doesn't make sense.

289
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:53,637
I just know if you start a job then finish it.

290
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:54,836
I promise.

291
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,878
Yes, you will.

292
00:25:56,927 --> 00:25:59,077
Goddamn right.

293
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:06,518
Their idea of discretion is to choose a motel

294
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:09,320
whose only clients are blood,
come and afro sheen.

295
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,358
Make yourself at home.

296
00:26:11,407 --> 00:26:13,398
You'll be hearing from us.

297
00:26:21,127 --> 00:26:22,640
We can't see Gold.

298
00:26:22,687 --> 00:26:25,247
What are you talking about?
I've been here for an hour.

299
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:27,437
I'm not the one
who asked for a fucking meeting.

300
00:26:27,487 --> 00:26:31,002
Apparently, no-one sees Gold.
We've got one of his representatives, Walker.

301
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,766
- Lilly Walker?
- That's right.

302
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:00,442
Mr Macha, I don't think we've met.

303
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:02,478
I'm Miss Walker.

304
00:27:02,527 --> 00:27:04,802
I work for Mr Gold. Do you mind if we walk?

305
00:27:06,887 --> 00:27:10,197
I understand you have been commissioned
to do some work for us?

306
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:13,239
I thought it might be a good idea
if we had a little chat

307
00:27:13,287 --> 00:27:17,678
to make sure you understand the gravity
of the endeavour you have undertaken.

308
00:27:17,727 --> 00:27:20,116
Yeah, I do, I understand.

309
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:24,080
Everything's set. The date hasn't changed,
you'll get the powder by Friday.

310
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:28,837
Good. Mr Gold has put his faith in you,
and he has people to please.

311
00:27:28,887 --> 00:27:31,560
We've heard
you might be having some problems?

312
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:33,598
No, no.

313
00:27:33,647 --> 00:27:36,036
We don't like publicity, Mr Macha.

314
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:39,557
No, neither do I.
I won't let you down, I won't let Mr Gold down.

315
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:08,922
So, we're clear?

316
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:13,476
Mr Gold doesn't give more time

317
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:16,325
or second chances.

318
00:28:16,367 --> 00:28:23,125
As you can appreciate, there is no shortage
of people who wish to do business with Mr Gold.

319
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:24,680
Good day.

320
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,365
Here's your money.

321
00:29:11,407 --> 00:29:13,125
What now?

322
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:15,078
Have a seat.

323
00:29:23,247 --> 00:29:26,717
We need to know how much time you did,
and who you did it with.

324
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:28,359
Why?

325
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:30,079
"Why?"

326
00:29:30,127 --> 00:29:31,879
The deal is we ask the questions.

327
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:41,558
I had two choices inside,

328
00:29:41,607 --> 00:29:45,122
14 years' normal time or seven years' solitary.

329
00:29:47,607 --> 00:29:49,279
I chose the solitary.

330
00:29:57,767 --> 00:30:00,600
I spent 20 hours a day locked up
in between two salty convicts

331
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:04,117
who had been down there for more years
than they cared to remember.

332
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:07,318
One was a chess master,
the other a master conman.

333
00:30:07,367 --> 00:30:09,358
They had never seen or spoken to each other,

334
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:13,002
but they might as well have been married,
they knew so much about one another.

335
00:30:13,047 --> 00:30:14,526
Once a day, the library on wheels

336
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:17,365
would be pushed around
by a pair of axe-murdering twins,

337
00:30:17,407 --> 00:30:19,682
that had pushed the trolley for 22 years.

338
00:30:23,207 --> 00:30:26,517
My neighbours used to write down chess moves
and concepts of the con

339
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:29,684
in the back pages of books
based on subjects like...

340
00:30:30,727 --> 00:30:37,326
Theoretical Astrophysics Part Four,
The Mathematics Of Quantum Mechanics.

341
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:39,562
They just used them for the con.

342
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:43,885
I used to intercept the books, because
I was sandwiched in between their cells.

343
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:48,478
It's a dangerous combination, chess and cons.

344
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:51,883
These boys were locked up on their own
for ten years with no distractions.

345
00:30:51,927 --> 00:30:55,920
Nothing to do but think about
how to steal one another's pieces.

346
00:30:57,887 --> 00:31:00,003
Yeah, they thought.

347
00:31:00,687 --> 00:31:02,166
They really thought.

348
00:31:02,207 --> 00:31:05,836
I was under the impression that I was
the clever bastard before I went in.

349
00:31:05,887 --> 00:31:10,483
But these boys were a completely different
class. Head tricksters of the premier division.

350
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:14,520
Their sole ambition was to create
the ultimate con and win the ultimate game,

351
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:17,400
always thinking quicker, always thinking bigger.

352
00:31:17,447 --> 00:31:21,884
Gradually, they thought
they'd found a formula to the con. Check.

353
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:25,681
A formula to win the ultimate win, the formula.

354
00:31:25,727 --> 00:31:27,683
I couldn't understand the depth of it,

355
00:31:27,727 --> 00:31:30,844
but they were confident it was real
and I believed them.

356
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:35,286
After all, they'd been right on everything else,

357
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:38,558
so now they felt they'd had their moment

358
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:41,917
and it was time for them
to leave the confines of their cell.

359
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,959
The concrete and steel wasn't even mentioned.

360
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:48,124
I didn't even doubt them.
They got whatever they wanted anyway.

361
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:51,876
I could smell their food
through 12 inches of concrete.

362
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:54,282
Bastards knew it used to drive me mad.

363
00:31:54,327 --> 00:31:56,477
You bastards.

364
00:31:56,527 --> 00:32:00,725
We were all going to go together,
they swore to me. "You're coming with us, Jake."

365
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:04,362
And I trusted them.
Never for a second did I doubt them.

366
00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:06,796
Next day, they were gone without a trace.

367
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:09,441
For the next week,
the authorities tore the place apart.

368
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:14,481
Couldn't find evidence of their existence,
let alone their exit. They just evaporated.

369
00:32:15,527 --> 00:32:17,085
Check.

370
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:20,243
Two years later, I was out.

371
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:23,482
But those two knew everything about me.

372
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:31,320
Everything. All my dirty little secrets,
how much money I had, where I kept it.

373
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,517
The hustling bastards cleaned me out.

374
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:37,355
They didn't leave so much
as a pair of socks, only a note.

375
00:32:37,407 --> 00:32:41,480
Rule one: You can only get smarter
by playing a smarter opponent.

376
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:47,401
But I had their formula and

377
00:32:47,447 --> 00:32:49,836
it worked.

378
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:51,878
It really worked.

379
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:55,237
Not doing you much good now, is it?

380
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:01,358
Checkmate.

381
00:33:01,407 --> 00:33:04,683
He needs to get moving.
Give him the addresses.

382
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:24,118
Why are they dragging this on?

383
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,398
They could just clean me out in one hit.

384
00:33:28,447 --> 00:33:30,358
They want me to suffer.

385
00:33:31,847 --> 00:33:36,443
These twisted bastards are making me pay.
Pay for my own pain.

386
00:33:37,487 --> 00:33:41,366
Hands down, that's the most radical concept
I have ever heard of...

387
00:33:42,407 --> 00:33:44,967
...and a part of me dies every time I think about it.

388
00:33:46,207 --> 00:33:52,601
I told myself if this is my last round,
they'll have to tear me out, piece by piece,

389
00:33:53,647 --> 00:33:56,161
but this I can't take.

390
00:33:56,207 --> 00:33:58,004
They've found a weakness.

391
00:33:59,047 --> 00:34:02,005
Caught me fair and square, cross-haired,

392
00:34:02,047 --> 00:34:06,677
blind-folded, one foot in the grave
and two hands on the coffin.

393
00:34:06,727 --> 00:34:12,404
I'm cooked, well done,
stick a fork in me and see if I bleed.

394
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:18,243
- Checkmate.
- You're quite good at this game, Mr Green.

395
00:34:19,887 --> 00:34:23,516
I am stuck in a trance...

396
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:28,606
...somewhere between hell and a hard place...

397
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:32,115
...in a gear that doesn't exist,

398
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:35,118
and all I want now...

399
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:38,158
...is a little peace.

400
00:34:42,367 --> 00:34:44,358
Where are you?

401
00:34:44,407 --> 00:34:46,875
- At the old lady's house.
- Does she have it?

402
00:34:46,927 --> 00:34:50,124
Of course she doesn't have it.
She's barely got a heartbeat.

403
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:52,920
How the hell is this woman
going to get that kind of money?

404
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:55,401
That's what she owes. Any furniture?

405
00:34:56,447 --> 00:34:58,199
No.

406
00:34:59,247 --> 00:35:01,636
Take the dog.

407
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:04,155
I am not taking the dog.

408
00:35:04,207 --> 00:35:06,880
- Then take the TV.
- The TV don't work.

409
00:35:06,927 --> 00:35:08,485
Then get your ass over here.

410
00:35:08,527 --> 00:35:10,438
How do you sleep at night?

411
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:13,478
How are we doing?

412
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:15,199
Ask the man.

413
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:19,238
No thanks, darling.

414
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:31,437
Time's up, lets go.

415
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:43,158
Mr Green, you took your time.

416
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:47,681
- Did you get anything from the old lady?
- No.

417
00:35:47,727 --> 00:35:49,718
Did you get anything from Horowitz?

418
00:35:49,767 --> 00:35:51,758
- No.
- Why not?

419
00:35:51,807 --> 00:35:53,798
Because he didn't have it.

420
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:56,645
Listen, pal, either he pays or you pay.

421
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,678
I pay anyway.

422
00:35:58,727 --> 00:36:00,718
Don't be a smartass.

423
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:06,001
Look, man,
we are not sending you out to polish door knobs.

424
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:08,038
You've got to get with it, man.

425
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,158
Doreen, take his car.

426
00:36:12,207 --> 00:36:14,641
Come with us.

427
00:36:14,687 --> 00:36:16,678
What is this?

428
00:36:16,727 --> 00:36:18,718
Where was security?

429
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:20,962
They gassed them. We found them tied up.

430
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:27,042
Hold tight, Mr Green.

431
00:36:31,327 --> 00:36:36,162
It was a 12-ton Hermann and Ziegler safe, Mr D.
It was impossible to break into.

432
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:37,879
Time's up, let's go.

433
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:41,761
Obviously, it wasn't fucking impossible
to move, was it, Paul?

434
00:36:45,047 --> 00:36:47,038
What did anyone take it for?

435
00:36:47,087 --> 00:36:49,601
We don't even use that safe, do we, Paul?

436
00:36:53,727 --> 00:36:55,683
Checkmate.

437
00:36:58,527 --> 00:37:00,245
How in the hell did you do that?

438
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,278
Not usually, no.

439
00:37:06,447 --> 00:37:09,041
Sam Gold's powder was in there.
It came in yesterday.

440
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:15,519
No, Paul, you're wrong.

441
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:21,635
Try again.

442
00:37:26,647 --> 00:37:28,638
You stupid motherfucker.

443
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:36,163
That should rattle him.

444
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:38,675
What the fuck was it doing
on one of our properties?

445
00:37:38,727 --> 00:37:41,002
Why don't you just fucking rape me, Paul?

446
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:44,358
Pull the troops together.

447
00:37:44,407 --> 00:37:46,921
Break some bones, hurt some people, results.

448
00:37:46,967 --> 00:37:48,958
- You hear me?
- I'll take care of it.

449
00:37:49,007 --> 00:37:51,919
You're damn straight
you're going to fucking take care of it.

450
00:37:51,967 --> 00:37:54,879
The word "excuse" does not exist
in Sam Gold's lexicon.

451
00:37:54,927 --> 00:37:58,203
We are the walking dead
until you fucking remedy this situation.

452
00:37:58,247 --> 00:38:00,442
- Do you understand?
- I'll take care of it.

453
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:04,275
I said, do you understand?

454
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:06,318
- Yes.
- You'd better.

455
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:09,483
In the meantime, get some more powder.

456
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:13,122
I don't care where it comes from
or how much it costs, just get it.

457
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:16,842
There's only one man who can get us
that amount on such short notice.

458
00:38:16,887 --> 00:38:18,684
Who?

459
00:38:18,727 --> 00:38:20,604
Lord John.

460
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:30,399
No way. I'm not nourishing the competition.

461
00:38:31,607 --> 00:38:33,802
That's twice the market price.

462
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,040
Sorry, we can't help, Mr Paul.

463
00:38:51,087 --> 00:38:53,078
Tony'll show you the way out.

464
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,359
All right. Hold on, hold on.

465
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:02,803
I am prepared to talk.

466
00:39:24,047 --> 00:39:26,242
What do you want to talk about?

467
00:39:30,007 --> 00:39:31,998
OK, get it.

468
00:39:32,047 --> 00:39:34,038
What?

469
00:39:35,087 --> 00:39:37,078
Am I having déjà-vu, Paul?

470
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:39,118
Didn't I just say "get it"?

471
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:46,079
This is Sam Gold
I have found myself chained to.

472
00:39:46,127 --> 00:39:48,118
Mr Black Magic.

473
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:50,158
Mr "l-run-this-game" Gold.

474
00:39:50,207 --> 00:39:53,995
Not some plastic gangster
with a pocketknife for backup.

475
00:39:54,047 --> 00:39:58,916
Gold doesn't give second chances, Paul.
I want in and I want rewards.

476
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,598
Got it?

477
00:40:10,567 --> 00:40:12,398
Paul,

478
00:40:12,447 --> 00:40:17,965
when you make the deal, keep both eyes
on that untrustworthy, greedy motherfucker.

479
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:17,755
If anyone asks, you don't speak the language.

480
00:41:25,847 --> 00:41:27,485
After you, Mr Green.

481
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,563
I'm taking the stairs.

482
00:41:29,607 --> 00:41:31,165
What's the problem, Mr Green?

483
00:41:31,207 --> 00:41:34,836
- I don't like elevators.
- What are you scared of?

484
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:37,924
Are you fucking deaf?
I said I just don't like them.

485
00:41:37,967 --> 00:41:40,162
Tough, because you're getting in.

486
00:41:50,927 --> 00:41:52,042
Everything?

487
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,959
If he wants a fucking war,
I'm going to give him a fucking war.

488
00:41:59,007 --> 00:42:02,556
I don't think it was Lord John, Mr D.
He knows you'd come looking for him.

489
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:06,202
He's not far from wrong. Because
that is exactly what I'm going to fucking do.

490
00:42:10,887 --> 00:42:12,798
I'll take the stairs.

491
00:42:14,087 --> 00:42:17,602
Before we do anything, Mr D,
we have to get Sam Gold his powder.

492
00:42:17,647 --> 00:42:20,081
- Don't pull the trigger...
- Shut your fucking mouth.

493
00:42:20,127 --> 00:42:21,845
- I'll get out.
- You ain't going nowhere.

494
00:42:25,207 --> 00:42:27,038
I said you're staying right here.

495
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:31,046
Get rid of the Lord...
there will be consequences.

496
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,442
Do I look like I'm afraid of the consequences?

497
00:42:37,767 --> 00:42:40,327
- I'm taking the stairs.
- You ain't going nowhere.

498
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:41,846
You motherfucking listen.

499
00:42:41,887 --> 00:42:45,084
Look at me. You think I'm afraid
of the fucking consequences?

500
00:42:45,127 --> 00:42:46,799
- Take the stairs.
- You listen to me.

501
00:42:49,047 --> 00:42:52,562
You open your mouth one more fucking time,
I'll blow your fucking head off.

502
00:42:52,607 --> 00:42:54,359
Fuck him.

503
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:55,760
Fuck the consequences.

504
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:00,318
Fuck them all.

505
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:02,244
- Do I look like I'm afraid?
- No.

506
00:43:02,287 --> 00:43:04,278
Do you understand me? Do you?

507
00:43:12,567 --> 00:43:14,523
Lou, what's going on?

508
00:43:14,567 --> 00:43:15,841
We're here.

509
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,876
How many?

510
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:21,605
We're doing a deal in the next room.

511
00:43:25,247 --> 00:43:26,521
When do you make the trade?

512
00:43:28,007 --> 00:43:29,963
- Ten minutes.
- Ten minutes?

513
00:43:31,047 --> 00:43:34,323
- Don't trust those yellow dogs.
- I don't trust anyone.

514
00:44:40,447 --> 00:44:42,244
Lou?

515
00:44:42,287 --> 00:44:44,562
Talk to me, you motherfucker.

516
00:44:44,607 --> 00:44:46,563
Or I'll kill you myself.

517
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:02,958
The consequences can kiss my black ass.

518
00:46:29,967 --> 00:46:32,037
This has become a large problem, Avi.

519
00:46:33,047 --> 00:46:35,959
There's no such thing as problems, Mr Green,

520
00:46:36,007 --> 00:46:38,760
only situations.

521
00:47:01,487 --> 00:47:03,284
Wake up, Mr Green.

522
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:10,558
Checkmate.

523
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:15,398
How?

524
00:47:15,447 --> 00:47:17,438
How what?

525
00:47:17,487 --> 00:47:19,762
We've kept you alive, now you can tell me.

526
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:21,684
How do you keep winning?

527
00:47:21,727 --> 00:47:23,718
It's very simple.

528
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:27,237
You do all the hard work, I just help you along.

529
00:47:30,567 --> 00:47:32,956
The art is for me to feed pieces to you

530
00:47:33,007 --> 00:47:38,365
and make you believe you took those pieces,
because you are smarter and I am dumber.

531
00:47:38,407 --> 00:47:43,720
In every game and con there is always
an opponent and there is always a victim.

532
00:47:43,767 --> 00:47:46,565
The more control the victim thinks he has,

533
00:47:47,607 --> 00:47:49,518
the less control he actually has.

534
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:51,558
Gradually he will hang himself.

535
00:47:51,607 --> 00:47:54,326
I, as the opponent, just help him along.

536
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:58,164
Is that the treasured formula?

537
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:01,358
The formula has infinite depth
in its efficacy and application,

538
00:48:01,407 --> 00:48:05,116
but it is staggeringly simple
and completely consistent.

539
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:10,366
Rule one of any game or con: You can only
get smarter by playing a smarter opponent.

540
00:48:10,407 --> 00:48:11,726
Rule number two.

541
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:16,318
The more sophisticated the game,
the more sophisticated the opponent.

542
00:48:17,367 --> 00:48:19,597
If the opponent is very good,

543
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:23,196
he will place his victim
inside an environment he can control.

544
00:48:23,247 --> 00:48:25,886
The bigger the environment,
the easier the control.

545
00:48:25,927 --> 00:48:30,603
Toss the dog a bone, find their weakness,

546
00:48:30,647 --> 00:48:33,559
and give them just a little
of what they think they want.

547
00:48:36,367 --> 00:48:37,595
Check.

548
00:48:37,647 --> 00:48:40,366
So the opponent simply distracts their victim

549
00:48:40,407 --> 00:48:43,524
by getting them consumed
with their own consumption.

550
00:48:47,727 --> 00:48:49,285
Check.

551
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:52,841
The word "snake" springs to mind.

552
00:48:52,887 --> 00:48:56,675
Don't knock it.
You only get smarter by playing a snake.

553
00:48:58,167 --> 00:49:02,604
The bigger the trick and older the trick,
the easier it is to pull.

554
00:49:02,647 --> 00:49:05,445
Based on two principles.

555
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:08,718
They think it can't be that old
and they think it can't be that big,

556
00:49:08,767 --> 00:49:10,644
for so many people to have fallen for it.

557
00:49:13,687 --> 00:49:17,362
Eventually,
when the opponent is challenged or questioned,

558
00:49:17,407 --> 00:49:22,686
it means the victim's investment
and thus his intelligence is questioned.

559
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:25,718
No-one can accept that,

560
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:27,758
not even to themselves.

561
00:49:31,727 --> 00:49:33,718
Checkmate.

562
00:49:34,767 --> 00:49:37,201
I ain't playing you again.

563
00:49:37,247 --> 00:49:41,206
You'll always find a good opponent
in the very last place you would ever look.

564
00:49:41,247 --> 00:49:45,365
You've got more tricks than a clown's pocket,
don't you, Mr Green?

565
00:49:58,367 --> 00:50:00,164
Everything all right?

566
00:50:10,327 --> 00:50:11,726
Can they hear you?

567
00:50:11,767 --> 00:50:13,837
Two minutes.

568
00:50:15,967 --> 00:50:17,958
You're OK.

569
00:50:18,007 --> 00:50:19,998
Get out, Jake, as soon as you can.

570
00:50:20,047 --> 00:50:22,607
I had to dig very deep
to find someone who'd talk.

571
00:50:22,647 --> 00:50:24,638
They're the last resort.

572
00:50:24,687 --> 00:50:30,717
They're the last resort. When no other
loan sharks will lend them, your boys move in.

573
00:50:31,767 --> 00:50:34,645
They stepped on Gold's toes
and he wouldn't touch 'em.

574
00:50:34,687 --> 00:50:36,166
Gold?

575
00:50:36,207 --> 00:50:39,563
Yes, the Gold, Sam Gold.

576
00:50:39,607 --> 00:50:41,916
Mr Clandestine.

577
00:50:41,967 --> 00:50:44,083
Mr Ambiguous.

578
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:46,083
Mr Mystery.

579
00:50:48,687 --> 00:50:50,040
Get out of there.

580
00:50:51,767 --> 00:50:53,644
Get out of there, Jake.

581
00:50:53,687 --> 00:50:57,805
No-one lives and displeases Gold.

582
00:50:57,847 --> 00:50:59,485
No-one but your two friends.

583
00:50:59,527 --> 00:51:02,405
Got to be something wrong with 'em
if Gold won't touch 'em.

584
00:51:02,447 --> 00:51:05,519
Got to be something wrong
if the Goldfather won't touch 'em.

585
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:07,683
No-one sees Gold,

586
00:51:07,727 --> 00:51:09,843
but Gold sees everything.

587
00:51:10,887 --> 00:51:15,438
The smoke signals say,
"Dodge 'em like an angry bullet."

588
00:51:15,487 --> 00:51:18,797
Tell your friend to get out of there.

589
00:51:18,847 --> 00:51:21,236
Jake, get out of there.

590
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:22,561
Get out of there.

591
00:51:22,607 --> 00:51:24,882
Get out of there.

592
00:51:35,567 --> 00:51:37,717
Tomorrow.

593
00:51:43,887 --> 00:51:45,878
You're worse than a stuck record.

594
00:51:45,927 --> 00:51:48,521
"Tomorrow, tomorrow."

595
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:50,523
Tomorrow is never going to come, is it?

596
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:51,966
Hello, it's warming up.

597
00:51:52,007 --> 00:51:54,965
Zach, kick him, see if that jogs him on.

598
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,838
You want me to play mother?

599
00:51:56,887 --> 00:51:59,447
I took care of Horowitz. It's your turn.

600
00:52:04,807 --> 00:52:07,196
Change of plan.

601
00:52:07,247 --> 00:52:08,965
I can see what's coming.

602
00:52:09,007 --> 00:52:10,645
Give it to Mr Green.

603
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:19,081
Mr Green.

604
00:52:19,127 --> 00:52:20,446
Shoot Fred for me.

605
00:52:23,327 --> 00:52:26,285
Not dead, stupid, just in the back of the knee.

606
00:52:26,327 --> 00:52:28,557
I ain't shooting Fred, Zach.

607
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:32,839
Sometimes, a little voice
tells you to think about number one.

608
00:52:32,887 --> 00:52:34,479
Told you, Avi.

609
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:38,917
Never had the gumption,
never going to have what it takes.

610
00:52:38,967 --> 00:52:40,719
It's easier than you think.

611
00:52:40,767 --> 00:52:43,327
It's one little squeeze,

612
00:52:43,367 --> 00:52:45,927
just like a tube of toothpaste.

613
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:47,798
Who the fuck are you two?

614
00:52:47,847 --> 00:52:50,281
You can't see what's right in front of you.

615
00:52:50,327 --> 00:52:57,085
You're supposed to be stiff, cold and horizontal,
and you still don't trust us?

616
00:52:58,127 --> 00:53:01,324
Shoot him in the kneecap.
The debt has to be paid.

617
00:53:02,367 --> 00:53:05,723
And sometimes it's best to listen to it.

618
00:53:06,927 --> 00:53:08,918
Get your arse up, Fred.

619
00:53:11,407 --> 00:53:12,840
Go on. Get out.

620
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:18,002
He can't do that, Jake.

621
00:53:18,047 --> 00:53:19,526
Then why don't you stop him, Avi?

622
00:53:19,567 --> 00:53:22,445
What the fuck do you know?
Shoot that toad now.

623
00:53:26,767 --> 00:53:28,325
One more step, Avi.

624
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:31,798
Just like a squeeze of toothpaste.

625
00:53:33,847 --> 00:53:36,520
You realise what you're doing, Mr Green?

626
00:53:36,567 --> 00:53:42,039
Hold on, Jake. This isn't the plan.
This won't have a happy ending.

627
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:45,045
One more step, Avi.

628
00:54:00,567 --> 00:54:02,523
Wake up, Mr Green.

629
00:54:39,207 --> 00:54:43,086
Congratulations, Mr Green.
It's past the third day and you have risen.

630
00:54:43,127 --> 00:54:45,118
I think you're due for a check-up.

631
00:54:51,927 --> 00:54:53,724
Did the bad guys get you?

632
00:54:53,767 --> 00:54:55,758
There's no such thing as "bad guys", Rachel.

633
00:54:55,807 --> 00:54:58,765
Yes, there are.
That's why Daddy's friends are looking after us.

634
00:54:58,807 --> 00:55:03,597
Never mind about that. Why don't you be a
good girl and get your Uncle Jake a cold drink?

635
00:55:13,767 --> 00:55:15,758
It's a bit of a mess, isn't it?

636
00:55:15,807 --> 00:55:17,843
Things will sort themselves out.

637
00:55:17,887 --> 00:55:19,878
Is she all right?

638
00:55:19,927 --> 00:55:23,078
Don't you worry about her.
You just look after yourself.

639
00:55:26,647 --> 00:55:29,320
Mr Green, I don't know how to tell you this.

640
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:33,076
Our first results,
they must have been wrong.

641
00:55:37,647 --> 00:55:39,956
I cannot apologise enough for this error.

642
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:43,602
You're not a well man, but...

643
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:05,643
We have to assess our clients very carefully.

644
00:56:13,407 --> 00:56:17,844
There is something about yourself
that you don't know.

645
00:56:17,887 --> 00:56:21,846
Something that you will deny even exists

646
00:56:21,887 --> 00:56:26,039
until it's too late to do anything about it.

647
00:56:31,447 --> 00:56:35,156
It's the only reason you get up in the morning,

648
00:56:35,207 --> 00:56:38,597
the only reason you suffer the shitty boss,

649
00:56:38,647 --> 00:56:41,366
the blood, the sweat and the tears.

650
00:56:42,407 --> 00:56:44,682
This is because you want people to know

651
00:56:44,727 --> 00:56:50,677
how good, attractive, generous, funny,
wild and clever you really are.

652
00:56:50,727 --> 00:56:54,925
"Fear or revere me,
but please think I'm special."

653
00:56:55,967 --> 00:56:58,242
We share an addiction.

654
00:56:58,287 --> 00:57:00,437
We're approval junkies.

655
00:57:01,327 --> 00:57:03,682
We're all in it for the slap on the back

656
00:57:03,727 --> 00:57:05,718
and the gold watch.

657
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:08,759
The "hip, hip, hoo-fucking-rah."

658
00:57:08,807 --> 00:57:13,039
Look at the clever boy
with the badge, polishing his trophy.

659
00:57:13,087 --> 00:57:16,443
Shine on, you crazy diamond.

660
00:57:16,487 --> 00:57:20,275
Cos we're just monkeys wrapped in suits,

661
00:57:20,327 --> 00:57:24,002
begging for the approval of others.

662
00:57:26,087 --> 00:57:29,045
If we knew this, we wouldn't do this.

663
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:31,521
Someone is hiding it from us.

664
00:57:32,567 --> 00:57:36,606
And if you had a second chance,
you would ask...

665
00:57:36,647 --> 00:57:37,841
Why?

666
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,878
- Why what?
- Why am I still alive?

667
00:57:39,927 --> 00:57:42,521
Why did you give my money away?

668
00:57:42,567 --> 00:57:44,558
Why didn't you want 'em to know?

669
00:57:45,767 --> 00:57:47,997
Why didn't you want me to know?

670
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,958
You'll find out soon enough.

671
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,398
Whilst I've been digging around on Lord John

672
00:57:55,447 --> 00:57:58,439
I came across a couple
of cash-talking shit-sniffers

673
00:57:58,487 --> 00:58:00,079
who came up with the name...

674
00:58:00,127 --> 00:58:01,719
Green.

675
00:58:01,767 --> 00:58:03,723
That's right, Jake Green.

676
00:58:03,767 --> 00:58:06,281
- Go on.
- I'm working for his brother.

677
00:58:06,327 --> 00:58:07,237
Patrick.

678
00:58:07,287 --> 00:58:11,997
A couple of opportunists, looking after
his older brother, got a little bit greedy.

679
00:58:12,047 --> 00:58:13,321
Want to impress you.

680
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:17,883
All right, you take Sorter and Slim Biggins
and enough men to avoid an excuse.

681
00:58:21,287 --> 00:58:23,676
It's about fucking time.

682
00:58:26,567 --> 00:58:28,876
Now that is a picture.

683
00:58:29,927 --> 00:58:32,760
You took your sweet-ass time.
I was starting to get bored.

684
00:58:32,807 --> 00:58:34,843
You should have kept busy with a swim.

685
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:38,596
Funny you should say that.
Zach's quite a swimmer, aren't you, Zach?

686
00:58:38,647 --> 00:58:40,763
20 lengths in ten seconds.

687
00:58:40,807 --> 00:58:45,676
We thought it might be a record. You want
to try to beat it? Come on in and join us.

688
00:58:45,727 --> 00:58:49,481
I'll just pop upstairs, grab my trunks,
and be down in a jiffy.

689
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:52,644
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Oh, and why is that, Avi?

690
00:58:52,687 --> 00:58:54,598
Why do you think we're in this icy birdbath,

691
00:58:54,647 --> 00:58:57,923
when we could be upstairs, toasty
and cosy, watching the naughty channel?

692
00:59:00,447 --> 00:59:04,360
How long can it take to get five coffees
and a couple of pizzas?

693
00:59:10,007 --> 00:59:12,316
You are on your own, Jakey boy.

694
00:59:17,247 --> 00:59:18,726
Move.

695
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:02,403
You've got to tell the boss.

696
01:00:02,447 --> 01:00:04,438
Why me?

697
01:00:04,487 --> 01:00:06,717
Because you're the one who ordered the pizza.

698
01:00:19,527 --> 01:00:22,246
This time you're going to tell me what's going on.

699
01:00:22,287 --> 01:00:24,278
Two sugars, am I right?

700
01:00:24,327 --> 01:00:25,965
Forget the tea, Avi.

701
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,998
Thank you, Jenny, that will be all.

702
01:00:31,727 --> 01:00:35,766
You didn't tell us the truth
about the three Eddies did you, Mr Green?

703
01:00:35,807 --> 01:00:37,843
The Eddies upset Macha in some way

704
01:00:37,887 --> 01:00:41,960
so he had them used as aggregate, and mixed
into some concrete on one of his buildings.

705
01:00:46,647 --> 01:00:49,764
Would you like us to remind you
of what really happened?

706
01:00:51,207 --> 01:00:54,597
The Eddies were waiting for you
when you got out of prison.

707
01:00:54,647 --> 01:00:56,603
It was Macha's fault.

708
01:00:56,647 --> 01:00:58,956
They didn't work for him any more,
and wanted to...

709
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,122
...compensate you.

710
01:01:00,167 --> 01:01:02,123
What they really meant was they wanted...

711
01:01:02,167 --> 01:01:06,046
...to put 12 grams of angry lead
in the back of your fucking head.

712
01:01:06,087 --> 01:01:08,840
But you gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.

713
01:01:08,887 --> 01:01:11,003
No-one kills a man
who's going to make 'em money.

714
01:01:11,047 --> 01:01:14,960
So you would give them 3% a month
on any money they would lend you.

715
01:01:15,007 --> 01:01:19,683
You needed the money quickly for some small
but profitable deal that you'd made on the inside.

716
01:01:19,727 --> 01:01:24,562
In fact, it was more profitable than any rate
they can get anywhere, legal or illegal.

717
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,677
- So, one of them said...
- I'm in.

718
01:01:26,727 --> 01:01:30,242
- A month later he got his money back.
- Plus your 3%.

719
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:34,597
- Now, nobody kills a man...
...who's going to make him money.

720
01:01:34,647 --> 01:01:37,525
- They always protect their investment.
- I can give you 4% a month.

721
01:01:37,567 --> 01:01:40,365
- You know this is just between us?
- That's right, Eddie.

722
01:01:40,407 --> 01:01:42,841
Next deal - this time they're all in.

723
01:01:42,887 --> 01:01:44,878
I give you 4% a month.

724
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:49,926
For two years you always came through,
regular like clockwork.

725
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:51,685
But there was no deal.

726
01:01:51,727 --> 01:01:55,879
You would take money off of one Eddie
and repay the other Eddie, plus the 4%.

727
01:01:55,927 --> 01:01:57,997
Plus your 4%. On top.

728
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:01,926
You were not greedy, you did it nice and slow.

729
01:02:01,967 --> 01:02:03,639
You were paying for their trust.

730
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:06,759
- This is just between us, right, Jake?
- That's right, Eddie.

731
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:10,959
It was the easiest money they'd known. Soon
they couldn't give you their money fast enough.

732
01:02:11,007 --> 01:02:13,726
A few months later they didn't
have enough of their own to lend,

733
01:02:13,767 --> 01:02:15,962
so they started to borrow money off Macha.

734
01:02:16,007 --> 01:02:17,679
- 3%?
- Plus your 3%.

735
01:02:17,727 --> 01:02:20,002
- 4%?
- Plus your 4%.

736
01:02:21,247 --> 01:02:22,965
5%?

737
01:02:23,007 --> 01:02:24,520
Macha became interested.

738
01:02:24,567 --> 01:02:26,956
How could the Eddies
have such a good little earner?

739
01:02:27,007 --> 01:02:31,000
- They hid you like a dirty little secret.
- Find out who's behind this.

740
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:32,241
Who's behind this?

741
01:02:33,487 --> 01:02:36,206
Ask no questions, hear no lies.

742
01:02:36,247 --> 01:02:39,364
- They tell anything but the truth.
- Find out if Green is behind this.

743
01:02:39,407 --> 01:02:43,605
- Is Jake Green behind this?
- I'll tell you, no, it's not Jake Green.

744
01:02:43,647 --> 01:02:47,879
- They'd do anything to protect their investment.
- I'm not sharing the golden goose.

745
01:02:47,927 --> 01:02:51,124
But Macha got his interest,
so he kept loaning them more and more.

746
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:52,919
Lend them the money.

747
01:02:52,967 --> 01:02:56,880
You were back gambling, making more money
than you knew what to do with. You were rich.

748
01:02:56,927 --> 01:02:58,918
I am rich.

749
01:02:58,967 --> 01:03:00,764
Seriously fucking rich.

750
01:03:00,807 --> 01:03:04,720
After a year, you had enough of the Eddies'
money, or should I say Macha's money...

751
01:03:04,767 --> 01:03:09,397
- Now I'm richer. A lot fucking richer.
...to buy a chain of hotels.

752
01:03:09,447 --> 01:03:11,802
So you went on a discreet three-month holiday.

753
01:03:11,847 --> 01:03:15,681
You took your brother, his daughter,
Macha's money and you enjoyed yourself.

754
01:03:15,727 --> 01:03:19,515
A bit of the old sun, sand, sea and sausages.

755
01:03:19,567 --> 01:03:22,479
The Eddies meanwhile
were having a terminal argument...

756
01:03:23,527 --> 01:03:27,566
...about how they were going to pay back Macha
that obscene amount of cash they owed him.

757
01:03:27,607 --> 01:03:29,802
I want my money back, Paul.

758
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:37,399
Those boys really suffered, Jake. The more
they told the truth, the more they suffered.

759
01:03:39,887 --> 01:03:42,799
- It's Jake Green.
- He's telling the fucking truth.

760
01:03:43,767 --> 01:03:46,600
They told me that story already.
Give me the truth.

761
01:03:47,607 --> 01:03:50,041
You gave them just enough rope
to hang themselves.

762
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:56,358
You're a good little conman, Jake.

763
01:03:56,407 --> 01:04:02,926
And you think you're smart, and you are,
just not as smart as you think you are.

764
01:04:09,527 --> 01:04:11,518
Elvis. Come here.

765
01:04:13,607 --> 01:04:16,724
If I wanted vinegar,
I would have ordered French fries.

766
01:04:17,767 --> 01:04:20,839
Get me something with a price tag on it.

767
01:04:22,807 --> 01:04:25,685
...Mr Green. What did he do, anyway?

768
01:04:27,287 --> 01:04:29,278
Hamish?

769
01:04:33,247 --> 01:04:36,762
It's OK, we're among friends.
Come on, what have you got for me?

770
01:04:39,487 --> 01:04:41,284
What am I going to tell him?

771
01:04:41,327 --> 01:04:44,842
That's your problem, but it had better be good.

772
01:04:46,807 --> 01:04:48,798
I turned up to pick them up...

773
01:05:01,847 --> 01:05:03,963
...and that is what I saw.

774
01:05:07,967 --> 01:05:09,958
That's a fascinating story.

775
01:05:11,367 --> 01:05:13,358
I have one question for you.

776
01:05:14,967 --> 01:05:17,083
How?

777
01:05:17,127 --> 01:05:18,879
How what?

778
01:05:18,927 --> 01:05:20,918
"How what?"

779
01:05:20,967 --> 01:05:22,958
There were six of us,

780
01:05:23,007 --> 01:05:25,646
plus Slim Biggins, who counts as another six.

781
01:05:25,687 --> 01:05:27,564
How many were there of him?

782
01:05:29,847 --> 01:05:31,963
- One.
- One.

783
01:05:33,407 --> 01:05:38,845
So, how exactly did this "one"
manage to disarm and overpower

784
01:05:38,887 --> 01:05:42,243
a four-time national body-building champion,

785
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:51,640
drag him half a block, throw him over a six-foot
wall and then get him to eat his own gun?

786
01:05:57,207 --> 01:05:58,879
Get down, boss.

787
01:05:59,767 --> 01:06:01,758
Just find the gunman.

788
01:06:03,007 --> 01:06:05,123
Don't fucking move.

789
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:06,964
Lou. Lou.

790
01:06:08,247 --> 01:06:10,681
- Keep the boss down.
- What the fuck's going on?

791
01:06:13,447 --> 01:06:15,278
I don't know.

792
01:06:15,327 --> 01:06:17,636
Sorter just shot the...

793
01:06:19,847 --> 01:06:21,917
...and he went in the kitchen.

794
01:06:21,967 --> 01:06:24,481
- Nobody fucking move.
- Bastard.

795
01:06:31,847 --> 01:06:33,678
Keep the fucking boss down.

796
01:08:50,527 --> 01:08:52,643
She shot my finger off.

797
01:08:52,687 --> 01:08:54,564
The bitch shot my finger off.

798
01:09:04,087 --> 01:09:06,078
Who is it?

799
01:09:10,727 --> 01:09:12,160
Happy Tony, Lord John's man.

800
01:09:13,207 --> 01:09:16,040
Not looking so happy now, is he?

801
01:09:20,807 --> 01:09:22,525
Check she's dead, Lou.

802
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:25,403
Greed gets them all in the end.

803
01:09:30,487 --> 01:09:32,523
Now, shoot straight, Sorter.

804
01:09:32,567 --> 01:09:35,206
Glad to see you've got those feelings in check.

805
01:09:42,367 --> 01:09:47,395
Find a couple of Lord John's boys and
persuade them to tell you where my powder is.

806
01:11:16,767 --> 01:11:19,565
What is the first rule of any game, Mr Green?

807
01:11:21,567 --> 01:11:25,162
The only way to get smarter
is by playing a smarter opponent.

808
01:11:25,207 --> 01:11:27,801
What's rule two of any game?

809
01:11:27,847 --> 01:11:31,601
The more sophisticated the game,
the more sophisticated the opponent.

810
01:11:32,647 --> 01:11:35,241
Almost the same,
but where does it stop, Mr Green?

811
01:11:36,287 --> 01:11:38,517
Where does this game stop?

812
01:11:38,567 --> 01:11:41,286
It stops when you start to give me answers.

813
01:11:41,327 --> 01:11:43,636
Don't let them play head games with you, Jake.

814
01:11:43,687 --> 01:11:46,360
Is it me that's playing head games with you,
Mr Green?

815
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:56,918
You've heard their voice for so long,
you believe it to be you.

816
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:01,407
You believe it to be your best friend.

817
01:12:02,007 --> 01:12:05,158
They should believe
their opponent to be their best friend.

818
01:12:05,207 --> 01:12:07,801
Where's the best place
an opponent should hide?

819
01:12:09,487 --> 01:12:12,365
In the very last place you would ever look.

820
01:12:12,407 --> 01:12:16,002
Do you know who Sam Gold is, Mr Green?

821
01:12:16,047 --> 01:12:18,038
You should,

822
01:12:18,087 --> 01:12:20,760
because he knows who you are.

823
01:12:20,807 --> 01:12:22,604
The Gold,

824
01:12:22,647 --> 01:12:24,444
Sam Gold.

825
01:12:24,487 --> 01:12:26,159
Mr Clandestine.

826
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:28,004
Mr Ambiguous.

827
01:12:28,047 --> 01:12:30,356
Mr Mystery.

828
01:12:30,407 --> 01:12:32,398
He's all up here,

829
01:12:33,447 --> 01:12:35,358
pretending to be you.

830
01:12:35,407 --> 01:12:37,762
No-one sees Gold,

831
01:12:37,807 --> 01:12:40,116
but Gold sees everything.

832
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:42,158
You're in a game, Jake.

833
01:12:42,207 --> 01:12:44,198
You're in the game.

834
01:12:45,247 --> 01:12:47,238
Everyone's in his game,

835
01:12:47,287 --> 01:12:49,278
and nobody knows it.

836
01:12:49,327 --> 01:12:53,400
And all of this, this is his world.

837
01:12:53,447 --> 01:12:54,880
He owns it.

838
01:12:55,927 --> 01:12:58,122
He controls it.

839
01:12:58,167 --> 01:13:01,159
I've had enough of this shit.
Tell him you've had enough.

840
01:13:01,207 --> 01:13:02,799
He tells you what to do...

841
01:13:02,847 --> 01:13:05,315
- Look, that's enough.
...and when to do it.

842
01:13:05,367 --> 01:13:08,564
- Tell him.
- I said that's enough, Avi.

843
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:12,680
Eventually, when the opponent
is challenged or questioned,

844
01:13:12,727 --> 01:13:17,005
it means the victim's investment
and thus his intelligence is questioned.

845
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:19,725
No-one can accept that,

846
01:13:20,767 --> 01:13:22,803
not even to themselves.

847
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:28,125
He's behind all the pain there ever was.

848
01:13:30,247 --> 01:13:33,364
Behind every crime ever committed.

849
01:13:38,727 --> 01:13:45,166
How can I be behind all the pain,
all the crime, if I don't even exist?

850
01:13:45,207 --> 01:13:51,282
And right now,
he's telling you that he doesn't even exist.

851
01:13:53,607 --> 01:13:57,885
No-one lives and displeases Gold.

852
01:13:57,927 --> 01:13:59,838
No-one but your two friends.

853
01:14:00,887 --> 01:14:04,482
We just put you to war
with the only enemy that ever existed,

854
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:07,564
and you, you think he's your best friend.

855
01:14:07,607 --> 01:14:12,317
And they will protect their best friend
with everything they've got.

856
01:14:13,367 --> 01:14:16,245
You're protecting him, Mr Green,

857
01:14:18,367 --> 01:14:20,358
but with what?

858
01:14:20,407 --> 01:14:23,319
Where's the best place
an opponent should hide?

859
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:27,843
In the very last place you'd ever look.

860
01:14:27,887 --> 01:14:30,845
He's hiding behind your pain, Jake.

861
01:14:35,367 --> 01:14:37,483
You're protecting him with your pain.

862
01:14:38,487 --> 01:14:43,481
Embrace the pain and you will win this game.

863
01:14:45,687 --> 01:14:51,205
And I know nothing hurts more
than humiliation and a little money loss.

864
01:14:51,247 --> 01:14:54,478
If you change the rules on what controls you...

865
01:14:54,527 --> 01:14:58,440
...you will change the rules
on what you can control.

866
01:14:59,447 --> 01:15:02,803
How radical are you prepared to be, Mr Green?

867
01:15:25,967 --> 01:15:29,323
The more power
you think you have in Gold's world,

868
01:15:29,367 --> 01:15:32,325
the less power you have in the real world.

869
01:15:35,007 --> 01:15:36,998
You are still in prison, Jake.

870
01:15:37,047 --> 01:15:40,039
In fact, you never left.

871
01:15:40,087 --> 01:15:44,285
Remember who they are, Jake.
Head tricksters, word slicksters.

872
01:15:44,327 --> 01:15:46,841
You wanted answers and they gave you riddles.

873
01:15:46,887 --> 01:15:50,357
You know the rules,
the longer you listened, the sweeter the pitch.

874
01:15:50,407 --> 01:15:53,479
He's got all the tricks and all the right answers.

875
01:15:54,807 --> 01:15:59,323
Don't let them do this to you, Jake.
Don't let them turn you against you.

876
01:16:02,207 --> 01:16:06,086
You don't give because it's good.
You give because it hurts him.

877
01:16:26,647 --> 01:16:28,638
What are we doing here?

878
01:16:29,647 --> 01:16:32,241
He's the enemy, Jake, not me.

879
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:36,121
Use your perceived enemy
to destroy your real enemy.

880
01:16:36,167 --> 01:16:39,682
Do not listen, Jake.
You've got a gun. Use it.

881
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:43,043
Don't wake him up. Suffocate him.

882
01:16:43,087 --> 01:16:46,079
Put the pillow over his head and suffocate him.

883
01:16:46,127 --> 01:16:48,766
He'd do it to you, Jake.

884
01:16:48,807 --> 01:16:51,526
If you can't do it, then you're not a free man.

885
01:16:51,567 --> 01:16:53,842
You are controlled.

886
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:56,401
"Controlled? Free man?"

887
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,802
Jake, wake up.

888
01:17:07,567 --> 01:17:11,958
Look, Mr Macha, I'm very sorry
to have woken you. Please listen to me.

889
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:16,681
Who's that? Mr Green?

890
01:17:16,727 --> 01:17:21,039
Mr Macha, please, I'm sorry to have woken you.
Listen to me.

891
01:17:21,087 --> 01:17:23,396
"Sorry." Listen at how you sound.

892
01:17:24,767 --> 01:17:26,519
I came to apologise.

893
01:17:26,567 --> 01:17:30,446
Forgive me for the things I've said
and for cheating you out of your money.

894
01:17:30,487 --> 01:17:32,239
I couldn't think clearly.

895
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,482
- Shut up.
- No, no, that's too much.

896
01:17:34,527 --> 01:17:38,520
Shoot the fucker. Shoot him.
He's been trying to kill you.

897
01:17:38,567 --> 01:17:41,559
He killed your friend, shot like a fucking dog.

898
01:17:42,607 --> 01:17:46,236
That's better, Jake, in control again.
Do the right thing.

899
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:49,165
Take care of your enemy, take care of business.

900
01:17:49,207 --> 01:17:53,723
Use any means possible
to induce head pain, and engage the enemy.

901
01:17:53,767 --> 01:17:55,564
Shut up.

902
01:17:55,607 --> 01:17:58,440
Wake up, Jake.
What are you fucking doing?

903
01:17:58,487 --> 01:18:00,478
Leave it.

904
01:18:00,527 --> 01:18:02,518
You're grovelling.

905
01:18:02,567 --> 01:18:05,798
I now realise you're a man
to be feared and respected.

906
01:18:09,487 --> 01:18:12,399
I now realise you're a man
to be feared and respected.

907
01:18:12,447 --> 01:18:14,278
Stop grovelling.

908
01:18:16,167 --> 01:18:18,158
Where's your pride?

909
01:18:24,727 --> 01:18:26,001
Where's your pride?

910
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:28,845
I made a big mistake, Mr Macha.
Shut up.

911
01:18:28,887 --> 01:18:31,924
I underestimated your power and your intellect.

912
01:18:31,967 --> 01:18:35,516
I've made a donation in your name
as a peace offering,

913
01:18:36,567 --> 01:18:38,762
as a token of my apology.

914
01:18:40,407 --> 01:18:42,762
I want you to...

915
01:18:42,807 --> 01:18:44,798
Shut up.

916
01:18:44,847 --> 01:18:46,678
I want you to forgive my stupidity.

917
01:19:08,567 --> 01:19:13,197
Wherever you don't want to go
is where you will find him.

918
01:19:15,247 --> 01:19:18,205
What is it that you are afraid of, Mr Green?

919
01:20:01,567 --> 01:20:04,161
Why are you doing this to yourself, Jake?

920
01:20:04,207 --> 01:20:06,198
It's too tight, Jake.

921
01:20:07,247 --> 01:20:09,238
We've got to get out.

922
01:20:10,247 --> 01:20:12,522
You're going to die in a tiny space, Jake.

923
01:20:17,207 --> 01:20:19,198
Have to get out.

924
01:20:22,247 --> 01:20:24,044
We're stuck, stuck.

925
01:20:24,087 --> 01:20:26,078
The walls are moving in.

926
01:20:27,767 --> 01:20:29,758
It's tight. I'm scared.

927
01:20:29,807 --> 01:20:32,765
We've got to get out. I can hear you.

928
01:20:36,767 --> 01:20:38,564
I can hear you.

929
01:20:38,607 --> 01:20:39,596
What?

930
01:20:39,647 --> 01:20:41,922
I can hear you.

931
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:44,162
I'm onto you.

932
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:53,486
Who takes care of the good times?

933
01:20:53,527 --> 01:20:56,166
- We're a team.
- We're best pals, Jake.

934
01:20:56,207 --> 01:21:00,200
- You want to get rid of me?
- Do you know life without me?

935
01:21:00,247 --> 01:21:03,922
- No. Because it doesn't...
...exist.

936
01:21:03,967 --> 01:21:05,719
- Do they talk about me, Jake?
- No.

937
01:21:05,767 --> 01:21:07,758
Because I don't exist.

938
01:21:07,807 --> 01:21:11,925
- Tell all your friends about me then, Jake?
- I protect you and I control you.

939
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:13,958
I say do, you obey.

940
01:21:14,007 --> 01:21:16,760
- If I say you're scared...
...you're scared.

941
01:21:16,807 --> 01:21:19,799
You've been listening to the other side,
haven't you, Jake?

942
01:21:19,847 --> 01:21:22,839
- Listening to people who want to hurt you.
- New people. New.

943
01:21:22,887 --> 01:21:24,878
Not old friends like me.

944
01:21:24,927 --> 01:21:29,364
People you shouldn't trust. Not me. I've been
your friend forever, since the beginning.

945
01:21:29,407 --> 01:21:32,399
Get rid of them, Jake, forever.
They're the enemy, not me.

946
01:21:32,447 --> 01:21:35,484
They're new, I'm old. I stay, they go.

947
01:21:35,527 --> 01:21:37,961
I say you do.

948
01:21:38,007 --> 01:21:39,076
You do.

949
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:41,118
You're weak without me, weak.

950
01:21:41,167 --> 01:21:42,885
It's us against them, Jake.

951
01:21:42,927 --> 01:21:45,361
It's us against them.

952
01:21:45,407 --> 01:21:47,716
I'm coming to get you.

953
01:21:47,767 --> 01:21:50,406
You want to get rid of me?
You want to make an enemy out of me?

954
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:52,517
You want to get rid of me, do you?

955
01:21:52,567 --> 01:21:54,080
Do you?

956
01:21:54,127 --> 01:21:56,561
You want to get rid of me, me, me, me?

957
01:22:11,287 --> 01:22:13,801
Still here, Jake?

958
01:22:13,847 --> 01:22:17,157
How long have I looked after you?

959
01:22:17,207 --> 01:22:19,277
You can't win this one without me.

960
01:22:20,887 --> 01:22:23,401
You know why?

961
01:22:24,447 --> 01:22:26,438
I am you.

962
01:22:29,487 --> 01:22:31,478
You ain't me.

963
01:22:32,767 --> 01:22:41,243
The greatest con that he ever pulled,
was making you believe that he is you.

964
01:22:42,567 --> 01:22:44,762
You ain't me.

965
01:22:44,807 --> 01:22:48,004
- I am you.
- You're not me.

966
01:22:48,047 --> 01:22:49,526
Come on.

967
01:22:52,527 --> 01:22:54,677
Your best fucking friend.

968
01:22:58,447 --> 01:23:00,802
I am you.

969
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:12,158
You don't control me.

970
01:23:13,127 --> 01:23:14,879
I control you.

971
01:23:46,167 --> 01:23:50,524
You come to my house with a loaded gun.

972
01:23:51,767 --> 01:23:55,885
You speak to me like I'm a fucking idiot.

973
01:23:57,327 --> 01:23:59,318
What's your game?

974
01:24:00,767 --> 01:24:02,758
What's your game?

975
01:24:04,167 --> 01:24:06,158
Speak to me.

976
01:24:07,847 --> 01:24:09,838
Speak to me.

977
01:24:09,887 --> 01:24:13,402
Or I'll kill you like the fucking dog that you are.

978
01:24:19,967 --> 01:24:21,958
Fear me.

979
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:34,917
Fear me.

980
01:25:35,767 --> 01:25:39,157
We have already killed Lord John
and two of your colleagues.

981
01:25:39,207 --> 01:25:42,995
If you value your life
more than a few bags of white powder,

982
01:25:43,047 --> 01:25:45,038
you will tell me...

983
01:25:45,087 --> 01:25:47,043
where it is hidden.

984
01:26:12,127 --> 01:26:14,118
Is everything all right, Mr D?

985
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:17,965
It will be when you take care
of my security, Paul.

986
01:26:19,087 --> 01:26:21,078
What are you holding the papers for?

987
01:26:22,127 --> 01:26:24,960
Because you're on the cover of half of them.

988
01:26:26,607 --> 01:26:29,997
If you don't mind me asking,
what has come over you, Mr D?

989
01:26:34,487 --> 01:26:36,478
They think you did it.

990
01:26:40,447 --> 01:26:43,803
Oh, my god.
Take the credit, they'll never know.

991
01:26:44,847 --> 01:26:47,202
This feels good.

992
01:26:53,647 --> 01:26:55,638
This feels quite good.

993
01:26:55,687 --> 01:26:57,882
I'm going to take the credit.

994
01:26:58,927 --> 01:27:01,122
It might come as a surprise to you, Paul,

995
01:27:03,647 --> 01:27:05,638
but I do have a heart.

996
01:27:09,167 --> 01:27:11,556
I have some news about Green.

997
01:27:11,607 --> 01:27:13,996
I'll give you news about Green.

998
01:27:14,047 --> 01:27:17,039
He now knows who's boss.

999
01:27:17,087 --> 01:27:20,921
He was snivelling like a baby
begging for forgiveness.

1000
01:27:20,967 --> 01:27:25,006
It was embarrassing. We're not going to
be hearing from Mr Green for a while.

1001
01:27:25,047 --> 01:27:28,039
I'm not sure if that's the case, Mr D.

1002
01:27:29,087 --> 01:27:31,681
Whilst you've been sleeping, we've been busy.

1003
01:27:31,727 --> 01:27:37,245
If Lord John's boys know where the powder is,
they took it to the grave.

1004
01:27:37,287 --> 01:27:39,847
We know Green's behind everything.

1005
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:42,640
He took your powder, not Lord John.

1006
01:27:42,687 --> 01:27:47,238
He's been playing games with us,
and he's been playing games with you.

1007
01:27:47,287 --> 01:27:49,403
Fear me. Fear me.

1008
01:27:49,447 --> 01:27:51,722
- Shut up.
- Fear me.

1009
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:54,042
- Shut up.
- Fear me.

1010
01:27:54,087 --> 01:27:57,397
- It doesn't look good.
- Shut up.

1011
01:27:57,447 --> 01:28:00,962
It doesn't look good.
The drums have been talking.

1012
01:28:10,767 --> 01:28:12,723
And what have the drums been saying?

1013
01:28:12,767 --> 01:28:16,282
They've been saying
what Sam Gold's been hearing.

1014
01:28:18,567 --> 01:28:20,762
Fear me.

1015
01:28:20,807 --> 01:28:25,642
Hearing about the little problems Mr Green
has been giving us, that's embarrassing.

1016
01:28:25,687 --> 01:28:28,918
We have an address for his brother.
We can take care of it.

1017
01:28:28,967 --> 01:28:31,356
Get him to talk, do whatever it takes.

1018
01:28:31,407 --> 01:28:34,524
Take Sorter and an army.
If they give any trouble, hurt 'em.

1019
01:28:34,567 --> 01:28:36,558
Let me read about that in the paper.

1020
01:28:36,607 --> 01:28:40,077
Get a hold of Green and get my powder.

1021
01:28:41,367 --> 01:28:43,278
Go.

1022
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,203
Are we expecting anyone?

1023
01:29:01,247 --> 01:29:03,841
I'll get it.

1024
01:29:03,887 --> 01:29:06,685
I said, are we expecting anyone?

1025
01:29:06,727 --> 01:29:08,718
Shouldn't you check first?

1026
01:29:20,687 --> 01:29:25,761
If you love your daddy,
be a good girl, hide in that cupboard.

1027
01:29:25,807 --> 01:29:27,798
Now.

1028
01:29:55,167 --> 01:29:57,203
Check the house.

1029
01:29:59,767 --> 01:30:01,917
You know why we're here?

1030
01:30:04,967 --> 01:30:06,525
Serpent.

1031
01:30:11,567 --> 01:30:17,039
I said, do you know why we're here?

1032
01:30:18,087 --> 01:30:20,965
I've some kind of an idea, yes.

1033
01:30:22,007 --> 01:30:24,282
Are you going to tell me?

1034
01:30:24,327 --> 01:30:26,318
Paul, I swear to you,

1035
01:30:27,367 --> 01:30:30,040
I haven't got a fucking clue where he is.

1036
01:30:36,047 --> 01:30:38,038
He's been moving about.

1037
01:30:39,087 --> 01:30:41,476
I swear to you, I have no idea where he is.

1038
01:30:46,047 --> 01:30:48,038
It's all right.

1039
01:30:51,047 --> 01:30:54,119
That's it. That's better. That's better.

1040
01:31:10,327 --> 01:31:12,887
I still don't believe you.

1041
01:31:19,527 --> 01:31:22,803
You can't trust anyone.
They're out to destroy me.

1042
01:31:22,847 --> 01:31:25,236
They're out to destroy you.

1043
01:31:25,287 --> 01:31:28,006
- You can't trust anyone.
- I can't trust anyone.

1044
01:31:30,047 --> 01:31:32,038
Can't let Gold down.

1045
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:35,078
He'll finish the business.

1046
01:31:36,127 --> 01:31:38,118
Then he'll finish me.

1047
01:31:39,527 --> 01:31:41,518
He's coming.

1048
01:31:41,567 --> 01:31:43,558
I won't see it coming.

1049
01:31:48,327 --> 01:31:51,319
He's coming. And I won't see it coming.

1050
01:31:51,367 --> 01:31:53,358
There's a woman here to see you, Mr D.

1051
01:31:55,887 --> 01:31:57,878
Said she cannot wait.

1052
01:31:59,567 --> 01:32:01,558
Don't tell me her name.

1053
01:32:01,607 --> 01:32:05,077
- Says she works for Gold.
- Don't tell me her name. Anyone but her.

1054
01:32:05,127 --> 01:32:07,766
- What's her name?
- Walker.

1055
01:32:07,807 --> 01:32:08,956
Anyone but her.

1056
01:32:09,007 --> 01:32:12,841
And everybody thought you were
such a disgusting man, Mr Macha.

1057
01:32:14,007 --> 01:32:16,885
Here it comes. Here it comes.

1058
01:32:16,927 --> 01:32:20,886
Mr Gold wishes to extend his respect
for such a magnanimous gesture.

1059
01:32:20,927 --> 01:32:22,645
But he was wondering...

1060
01:32:22,687 --> 01:32:24,882
- That's a wreath.
- That's a fucking wreath.

1061
01:32:24,927 --> 01:32:27,725
...if you can afford the time to give so generously,

1062
01:32:27,767 --> 01:32:30,281
why you haven't had time
to conclude our business?

1063
01:32:30,327 --> 01:32:32,477
Everything's under control. I need more time.

1064
01:32:32,527 --> 01:32:35,519
It's anything but under control,
isn't it, Mr Macha?

1065
01:32:37,127 --> 01:32:39,118
Mr Gold doesn't give more time.

1066
01:32:41,167 --> 01:32:43,078
And he doesn't give second chances.

1067
01:32:46,367 --> 01:32:48,358
You will be hearing from him.

1068
01:32:48,407 --> 01:32:50,159
Good day.

1069
01:32:50,207 --> 01:32:53,040
"Good day?" What the fuck does that mean?

1070
01:32:53,087 --> 01:32:55,078
What the fuck does that mean?

1071
01:32:55,127 --> 01:32:57,595
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?

1072
01:32:57,647 --> 01:32:59,638
Some fucking street hustler?

1073
01:32:59,687 --> 01:33:03,441
If he wants to meet me, you send him here
and we'll see what he has to say.

1074
01:33:05,527 --> 01:33:07,836
I'll kill 'em, I'll kill all of 'em.

1075
01:33:07,887 --> 01:33:09,878
I'll kill 'em first.

1076
01:33:09,927 --> 01:33:12,999
They'll kill us first, they'll fucking annihilate me.

1077
01:33:13,047 --> 01:33:15,038
Beg, beg. Take it back, beg, beg.

1078
01:33:15,087 --> 01:33:17,078
Beg, you idiot.

1079
01:33:17,127 --> 01:33:20,517
Wait, wait. I didn't mean what I just said.

1080
01:33:27,247 --> 01:33:30,045
"Good day?" What the fuck does that mean?

1081
01:33:30,087 --> 01:33:34,444
That means he's going to end my game
and I won't see it coming.

1082
01:34:12,367 --> 01:34:14,676
I'm going to make this fair.

1083
01:34:14,727 --> 01:34:16,399
This...

1084
01:34:17,447 --> 01:34:19,438
...is for you.

1085
01:34:22,327 --> 01:34:23,885
These...

1086
01:34:25,527 --> 01:34:27,518
...for me.

1087
01:34:30,567 --> 01:34:35,118
One good chop, and you'll make the sink.

1088
01:34:38,327 --> 01:34:40,443
OK, that's enough.

1089
01:34:43,287 --> 01:34:47,599
Question me again, Sorter,
and we will have a falling out.

1090
01:34:58,567 --> 01:35:00,637
Tell me what's happening, Lou.

1091
01:35:00,687 --> 01:35:05,283
I got tired of waiting by the car, so I went inside.

1092
01:35:05,327 --> 01:35:10,082
Paul, he was getting excited,
you know how he does.

1093
01:35:10,127 --> 01:35:12,277
He started messing with the little girl's hair.

1094
01:35:12,327 --> 01:35:13,919
Out of nowhere, Sorter shot him.

1095
01:35:13,967 --> 01:35:15,844
Your daddy loves you so much.

1096
01:35:15,887 --> 01:35:17,286
- Shot who?
- Paul.

1097
01:35:19,567 --> 01:35:23,162
Then he turned the gun on the two bodyguards,
both gone in a blink of an eye.

1098
01:35:28,767 --> 01:35:30,758
Listen to me, sweetheart.

1099
01:35:30,807 --> 01:35:32,957
None of this is real.

1100
01:35:33,007 --> 01:35:35,362
It's just a game that the grown-ups are playing.

1101
01:35:36,447 --> 01:35:38,244
Now what I want you to do,

1102
01:35:38,287 --> 01:35:42,439
I want you to get in the cupboard
and I want you to put your fingers in your ears,

1103
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:44,557
and it'll be all over before you know it.

1104
01:35:44,607 --> 01:35:46,598
Do as the man says, babe.

1105
01:35:46,647 --> 01:35:49,115
Put your fingers in your ears
and go in the cupboard.

1106
01:35:49,847 --> 01:35:51,166
Good girl.

1107
01:35:51,207 --> 01:35:53,243
Pull yourself together, man.

1108
01:35:53,287 --> 01:35:56,484
Sorter, we're going to have to take the girl.

1109
01:35:56,527 --> 01:35:59,997
Of course you have.
Now all you've got to do is come and get her.

1110
01:37:55,727 --> 01:37:57,683
I'm the only one left.

1111
01:37:57,727 --> 01:37:59,126
Where's the girl?

1112
01:38:09,167 --> 01:38:11,158
What are we doing here?

1113
01:38:11,207 --> 01:38:13,198
One last treat,

1114
01:38:13,247 --> 01:38:15,238
and bring the powder.

1115
01:38:24,767 --> 01:38:26,837
Jake Green is in the Casino.

1116
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:31,478
How the fuck does he know?

1117
01:38:48,967 --> 01:38:50,798
Why are we here?

1118
01:38:50,847 --> 01:38:52,838
You have a meeting.

1119
01:38:54,647 --> 01:38:56,638
Got a little time to spare.

1120
01:38:56,687 --> 01:38:58,837
Let's have a game.

1121
01:38:58,887 --> 01:39:01,162
Bring him up.

1122
01:39:19,767 --> 01:39:22,964
You know what's so elegant
about this little game, Jake?

1123
01:39:25,127 --> 01:39:27,118
Nobody knows where the enemy is.

1124
01:39:28,167 --> 01:39:30,317
They don't even know he exists.

1125
01:39:36,567 --> 01:39:39,161
He's in every one of their heads.

1126
01:39:39,207 --> 01:39:41,038
And they trust him...

1127
01:39:44,127 --> 01:39:46,118
...because they think they are him.

1128
01:39:49,047 --> 01:39:55,520
If you try to destroy him to save them,
they'll destroy you to save him.

1129
01:39:55,567 --> 01:39:57,558
It's beautiful, man.

1130
01:39:58,367 --> 01:40:01,200
You have to admire the opponent's elegance.

1131
01:40:01,247 --> 01:40:03,078
Check.

1132
01:40:07,647 --> 01:40:12,323
You're quite good at this game, Mr Green.
I know because I'm quite good at this game.

1133
01:40:16,807 --> 01:40:18,399
Check.

1134
01:40:26,407 --> 01:40:27,806
Check.

1135
01:40:35,167 --> 01:40:37,601
Check.

1136
01:40:45,767 --> 01:40:50,887
The art is for me to feed pieces to you,
and make you believe you took those pieces,

1137
01:40:50,927 --> 01:40:55,125
because you're smarter and I'm dumber.

1138
01:41:05,847 --> 01:41:06,962
Checkmate.

1139
01:41:21,287 --> 01:41:23,198
Wake up, Mr Green.

1140
01:41:27,367 --> 01:41:29,437
You can't see what's right in front of you.

1141
01:41:35,527 --> 01:41:38,837
I never saw or spoke to those boys
in all those years,

1142
01:41:38,887 --> 01:41:42,323
but you know
I would have died for either one of them.

1143
01:41:42,367 --> 01:41:45,598
One was a chess master,
the other a master conman.

1144
01:41:45,647 --> 01:41:49,037
Dangerous combination, chess and cons.

1145
01:41:52,247 --> 01:41:54,397
Those two knew everything about me.

1146
01:41:54,447 --> 01:41:58,122
All my dirty little secrets,
how much money I had, where I kept it.

1147
01:41:58,167 --> 01:42:00,601
Hustling bastards cleaned me out.

1148
01:42:06,487 --> 01:42:10,196
My neighbours used to write down chess moves
and concepts of the con

1149
01:42:10,247 --> 01:42:15,605
in the back pages of books based on subjects
like The Mathematics Of Quantum Mechanics.

1150
01:42:15,647 --> 01:42:16,875
Wake up, Mr Green.

1151
01:42:16,927 --> 01:42:19,725
We were all going to go together,
they swore to me.

1152
01:42:19,767 --> 01:42:21,837
"You're coming with us, Jake."

1153
01:42:21,887 --> 01:42:24,924
We were always going to take you with us, Jake.

1154
01:42:24,967 --> 01:42:29,085
You just weren't ready to hear
how hard that was going to be.

1155
01:42:33,687 --> 01:42:35,757
We didn't do this because we like you.

1156
01:42:37,207 --> 01:42:39,198
We did this because...

1157
01:42:41,647 --> 01:42:43,717
...we are you.

1158
01:43:01,007 --> 01:43:02,998
Time for that meeting.

1159
01:43:04,047 --> 01:43:06,481
Give him what he wants.

1160
01:43:06,527 --> 01:43:08,643
I'm sure that will make him very happy.

1161
01:43:25,447 --> 01:43:29,963
I know you're still there,
cos I can feel you dying.

1162
01:43:31,007 --> 01:43:34,886
I can hear you, tapping me for a little nutrition.

1163
01:43:36,887 --> 01:43:38,878
Now who's clucking for a fix?

1164
01:43:38,927 --> 01:43:41,680
Think it's a little tight in here, do you?

1165
01:43:42,687 --> 01:43:46,885
You're not wrong,
cos the walls are moving in.

1166
01:43:47,927 --> 01:43:51,124
No food here, not today, sunshine.

1167
01:43:52,167 --> 01:43:54,840
My eyes are open and the restaurant's closed.

1168
01:43:54,887 --> 01:43:57,799
Jog on, slide off.

1169
01:43:57,847 --> 01:44:00,441
Find someone else to fill your pipe,

1170
01:44:00,487 --> 01:44:06,198
someone who won't see you coming
or know when you're there.

1171
01:44:11,967 --> 01:44:16,279
You think I'm an evil man.
You think I am an evil man, don't you?

1172
01:44:17,727 --> 01:44:20,446
Rachel, look at me, honey.

1173
01:44:24,327 --> 01:44:26,795
Think I don't know your fucking game?

1174
01:44:26,847 --> 01:44:31,318
I do, I know your game,
I see your game, I am your game.

1175
01:44:31,367 --> 01:44:34,564
Rachel, look at me, baby.

1176
01:44:38,047 --> 01:44:41,198
You don't play by the rules, Mr Green.

1177
01:44:41,247 --> 01:44:47,641
You like to play silly games with my head,
don't you?

1178
01:44:50,407 --> 01:44:53,683
- You're a fucking survivor,
- A winner.

1179
01:44:53,727 --> 01:44:57,606
- You're a pussy drowning in his own shit.
- Shut up and leave me alone.

1180
01:44:58,687 --> 01:45:01,247
He chose his hiding place very carefully.

1181
01:45:01,287 --> 01:45:04,085
I can't let him kill me.

1182
01:45:04,127 --> 01:45:06,118
You're weak. It's too late.

1183
01:45:06,167 --> 01:45:08,556
You're a dead man anyway.
You'll be dead before dawn.

1184
01:45:08,607 --> 01:45:11,121
The word "excuse" does not exist
in Sam Gold's lexicon.

1185
01:45:11,167 --> 01:45:13,476
This is Sam Gold I found myself chained to.

1186
01:45:13,527 --> 01:45:15,518
Mr Black Magic.

1187
01:45:15,567 --> 01:45:17,558
Mr "l-run-this-game" Gold.

1188
01:45:17,607 --> 01:45:20,485
We can't see Gold.
Apparently, no-one sees Gold.

1189
01:45:20,527 --> 01:45:22,245
No-one gets away from Gold.

1190
01:45:24,247 --> 01:45:26,044
Get control of yourself.

1191
01:45:26,087 --> 01:45:29,159
It's anything but under control,
isn't it, Mr Macha?

1192
01:45:29,207 --> 01:45:33,723
He's going to kill me, he'll kill me.
Where's your pride? Where's your pride?

1193
01:45:37,647 --> 01:45:40,559
I'd rather kill myself than let him kill me.

1194
01:45:42,647 --> 01:45:45,878
Why isn't he scared? He's just staring at me.

1195
01:45:48,527 --> 01:45:51,997
- You'll be hearing from him.
- But he can't kill a dead man.

1196
01:45:52,047 --> 01:45:54,436
But he can't kill a dead man,

1197
01:45:54,487 --> 01:45:56,478
can he?

1198
01:46:00,367 --> 01:46:02,358
He can't kill a dead man, can he?

1199
01:46:08,687 --> 01:46:10,962
You can't even do it, can you?

1200
01:46:22,767 --> 01:46:25,884
The greatest con that he ever pulled

1201
01:46:26,927 --> 01:46:29,646
...was making you believe...

1202
01:46:30,687 --> 01:46:32,405
...that he is you.
