1
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:22,731
# See them
tumbling down #

2
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:26,527
# Pledging their love
to the ground #

3
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,946
Narrator: A way out west
there was this fella,

4
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,240
fella I want
to tell you about,

5
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,743
fella by the name
of Jeff Lebowski,

6
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,620
at least that
was the handle

7
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,539
That his loving parents
gave him.

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,458
But he never had
much use for it himself.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,337
This Lebowski,
he called himself The Dude.

10
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,132
Now Dude, that's a name
no one would self-apply

11
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,051
where I come from.

12
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,428
But then, there was
a lot about The Dude

13
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,348
that didn't make a whole
lot of sense to me,

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,142
and a lot about
where he lived, likewise.

15
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,019
# Along with the
tumbling tumbleweed #

16
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,521
Narrator: But then again,

17
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:06,483
maybe that's why I found the
place so dern interesting.

18
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:14,533
They call Los Angeles
The City of Angels.

19
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,452
I didn't find it
to be that exactly.

20
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:21,248
But I値l allow there
are some nice folks there.

21
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,042
'Course I can't
say I seen London,

22
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,919
And I never
been to France,

23
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,839
And I ain't never seen no
queen in her damned undies

24
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,841
as the fella says.

25
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,718
But I値l tell you what,

26
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,636
after seeing Los Angeles

27
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:38,056
And this a-here story
I'm about to unfold,

28
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,934
Well, I guess
I seen somethin'

29
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,352
every bit as stupefyin'

30
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,730
as you'd see in any
of those other places,

31
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,149
and in English, too.

32
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:50,027
So I can die
with a smile on my face

33
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,447
without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.

34
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,824
Now this here story
I'm about to unfold

35
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,744
took place back
in the early nineties,

36
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,121
just about the time of
our conflict with Saddam

37
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,040
and the Iraqis.

38
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,752
I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's a man,

39
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,754
I won't say a hero,

40
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,756
'Cause what's a hero?

41
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,133
But sometimes
there's a man,

42
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,053
and I知 talking
about The Dude here,

43
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,847
sometimes there's a man,

44
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,224
well,

45
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,143
he's the man
for his time and place.

46
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:26,146
He fits right in there,

47
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,023
and that's The Dude,

48
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,942
in Los Angeles.

49
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,320
And even if
he's a lazy man,

50
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,739
and The Dude was
most certainly that,

51
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:39,117
quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,

52
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,036
which would place him
high in the running

53
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,956
for laziest worldwide.

54
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,750
But sometimes
there's a man,

55
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:50,045
sometimes...
There's a man.

56
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:54,424
Wow, lost my train
of thought here.

57
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,219
But--ah, hell.

58
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,638
I done introduced
him enough.

59
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,139
George Bush: All for
a collective action.

60
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,058
This will not stand.

61
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,518
This will not stand,

62
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,020
this aggression
against Kuwait.

63
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:12,651
# Here on the range
I belong #

64
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:17,948
# Drifting along
with the tumbling #

65
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:24,788
# Tumbleweed #

66
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:32,462
Aah!

67
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,551
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

68
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,845
I want that money,
Lebowski.

69
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,431
Bunny says you're
good for it.

70
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:47,644
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

71
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,646
Where's the fucking
money, shithead?!

72
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,523
Well, it's, uh, ohh,

73
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,524
Uh,

74
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,943
It's down there somewhere.
let me take another look.

75
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,488
Don't fuck with us!

76
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,617
Your wife owes money
to Jackie Treehorn,

77
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,536
That means you own
money to Jackie Treehorn.

78
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,497
Ever thus to
deadbeats, Lebowski.

79
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,875
No, no, don't do that--

80
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,544
Not on the rug, man.

81
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,545
See?

82
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,047
See what happens,
Lebowski?

83
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,924
You see what happens?

84
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,342
Nobody calls me
Lebowski.

85
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,720
You got the wrong guy.
I'm The Dude, man.

86
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,639
Your name's
Lebowski, Lebowski.

87
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,557
Your wife is Bunny.

88
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,936
My--my wife--
my wife Bunny?

89
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,355
Do you see a wedding
ring on my finger?

90
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,148
Does this place look
like I知 fucking married?

91
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,692
The toilet seat's up,
man.

92
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,244
What the fuck
is this?

93
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,288
Obviously,
you're not a golfer.

94
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,958
Woo?

95
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:51,917
Yeah?

96
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,170
Isn't this guy supposed
to be a millionaire?

97
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,339
Woo: Fuck!

98
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:00,133
Yeah, what do you think?

99
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,052
He looks like
a fucking loser.

100
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,930
Hey, at least
I'm housebroken.

101
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,849
Fucking time wasted.

102
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,059
Thanks a lot,
asshole.

103

# Nearly any task #

109
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,139
# And as for compensation #

110
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:50,017
# There's a little
he would ask #

111
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,353
# Take a woman like you #

112
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,731

113
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,275
# To the man in me #

114
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,323
# The storm clouds
are raging #

115

# All around my door #

116
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,620
# I think to myself #

117
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:13,540
# I might not
take it anymore #

118
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,418
# Take a woman
like your kind #

119
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,465
# To find the man in me #

120
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:26,053
# But, oh #

121
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,972
# What a wonderful feeling #

122
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:35,187
# Just to know
that you are near #

123
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:41,568
# That sets
my heart a-reelin' #

124
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:45,322
# From my toes #

125
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:49,117
# Up to my ears #

126
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,454
# The man in me
will hide sometimes #

127
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,332
# To keep from being seen #

128
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,251
# But that's just because #

129
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:01,630
# He doesn't want to
turn into some machine #

130
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:04,550
# Take a woman like you #

131
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,426
# To get through #

132
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,470
# To the man in me #

133
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,724
Whoo!

134
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,226
I'm throwing
rocks tonight.

135
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,644
Mark it, Dude.

136
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:18,021
This was a valued rug.

137
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,523
Ahem. This was a...

138
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,942
Yeah, man, it really
tied the room together.

139
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,819
So this was
a valued, uh--

140
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,237
What tied the room
together, Dude?

141
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,238
My rug.

142
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,656
Were you listening to
The Dude's story, Donny?

143
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:28,657
What?

144
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,033
Were you listening
to The Dude's story?

145
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,535
I was bowling.

146
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:33,954
So you have no frame
of reference here, Donny.

147
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,330
You're like a child

148
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,832
who wanders in
in the middle of a movie--

149
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:37,749
Walter, what's
the point, man?

150
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,626
There's no reason--
here's my point, Dude--

151
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,044
There's no fucking reason--

152
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,546
Yeah, Walter,
what's your point?

153
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:42,921
Huh?

154
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,423
Walter, what
is the point--

155
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,341
Look, we all know
who is at fault here.

156
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,218
What the fuck are
you talking about?

157
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,137
Huh? No, what
the fuck are you--

158
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,139
I'm not--

159
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,558
We're talking about unchecked
aggression here, Dude.

160
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,934
What the fuck is
he talking about?

161
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,019
My rug.

162
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,437
Forget it, Donny.
you're out of your element.

163
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,355
Walter, the chinaman
who peed on my rug,

164
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,357
I can't go
give him a bill.

165
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,151
So what the fuck
are you talking about?

166
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,527
What the fuck
are you talking about?

167
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,446
The chinaman is not
the issue here, Dude.

168
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,323
I'm talking about drawing
a line in the sand, Dude.

169
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,742
Across this line,
you do not--

170
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:15,120
Also, Dude, chinaman is not
the preferred nomenclature.

171
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,039
Asian-american,
please.

172
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,958
Walter, this isn't a guy
who built the railroads here,

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,335
this is a guy--

174
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,836
What the fuck
are you talking--

175
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,254
Walter,
he peed on my rug.

176
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,256
He peed on
The Dude's rug.

177
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,133
Donny, you're
out of your element.

178
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,552
Dude, the chinaman
is not the issue here.

179
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,553
So, who--who--

180
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:32,930
Jeff Lebowski.

181
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,348
The other
Jeffrey Lebowski,

182
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,225
the millionaire.

183
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,226
That's fucking
interesting, man.

184
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,644
That's fucking
interesting.

185
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,021
Plus, he has
the wealth, obviously,

186
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,523
and the resources,

187
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,941
uh, so that
there's no reason--

188
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,442
there's no
fucking reason

189
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:46,818
why his wife
should go out

190
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,819
and owe money
all over town,

191
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,737
and then they come

192
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,739
and they pee on
your fucking rug!

193
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:51,657
Am I wrong? No.

194
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,658
Am I wrong?

195
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,534
Yeah, but--

196
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,536
Ok, then. Ahem.

197
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,454
That rug really tied
the room together,

198
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,331
Did it not?

199
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,249
Fuckin' a!

200
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,625
And this guy
peed on it.

201
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:02,626
Donny, please.

202
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,044
You know, this
is the fucking guy--

203
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,546
I could find this
fucking Lebowski guy.

204
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,922
His name is Lebowski?

205
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,423
That's your name, Dude.

206
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,842
This is the guy

207
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,718
who should compensate me
for the fucking rug.

208
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,220
His wife goes out

209
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,638
and owes money
all over town,

210
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,056
and they pee on my rug?

211
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,058
They pee on
your fucking rug.

212
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,434
They pee on
my fucking rug.

213
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,894
Walter: That's right, Dude.

214
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,398
They peed on
your fucking rug.

215
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,025
This is the study.

216
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,944
As you can see,
the various commendations...

217
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,946
"Jeffrey Lebowski."

218
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,323
Honorary degrees,
etcetera.

219
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,741
Hmm, very impressive.

220
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,119
Oh, please feel free
to inspect them.

221
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,037
Hmm? Oh, no, I知
not really that--

222
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,038
Oh, please, please.

223
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,957
That is the key to
the city of Pasadena,

224
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,834
Which Mr. Lebowski
received 2 years ago

225
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,837
In recognition of
his various civic, uh...

226
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,256
Oh, that's
the Los Angeles

227
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,258
Chamber of Commerce
Business Achiever Award,

228
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,634
which is given--

229
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:53,927
oh, not necessarily
given every year.

230
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:57,347
Hey, is this, uh,
is this him with Nancy?

231
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,224
Yes, indeed,
that is Mr. Lebowski

232
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,226
with the first lady, yes.
it was taken when--

233
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,021
That's, uh, Lebowski
on the left there?

234
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,023
Yeah, of course.
Mr. Lebowski on the left--

235
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,441
so he's a cripple--

236
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,818
Uh, you know,
a--a handicapped guy?

237
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,737
Mr. Lebowski
is disabled, yes.

238
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,238
Uh, this picture
was taken

239
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,657
when Mrs. Reagan was
first lady of the nation,

240
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,035
Yes, yes.
Not of California.

241
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,036
Pope John.

242
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,829
Uh, in fact, he met
privately with the President,

243
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:21,747
though unfortunately,

244
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,749
There wasn't enough time
for a photo opportunity.

245
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,125
Oh, Nancy痴 pretty good.

246
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,044
Oh, wonderful woman.
we're very happy--

247
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,045
these are, uh...

248
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,422
oh, those are Mr. Lebowski's
children, so to speak.

249
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,341
Different mothers, huh?

250
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,842
Racially, pretty cool.

251
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,219
Ha ha ha ha.

252
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,137
They're not literally
his children.

253
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,556
They're the little
Lebowski Urban Achievers,

254
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,058
Inner-city children
of promise

255
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,434
but without
the necessary means for--

256
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,436
necessary means for
a higher education.

257
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,355
So Mr. Lebowski
is committed

258
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,148
to sending all
of them to college.

259
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,149
Excuse me.

260
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,026
Thank you. Thank you.

261
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:51,944
Far out.

262
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,946
Think he's got room
for one more?

263
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:54,821
One, uh...

264
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,823
Oh. Ha ha ha.

265
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,325
You never
went to college.

266
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,743
Please,
don't touch that.

267
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,453
Yeah, no, I did,
but, you know,

268
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,330
I spent most
of my time, um,

269
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,249
occupying various
administration buildings,

270
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,626
uh, smoking a lot
of thai stick,

271
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,127
breaking into
the R.O.T.C.,

272
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,546
and bowling.

273
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,047
to tell you
the truth, Brandt,

274
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,423
I don't remember
most of it.

275
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,383
Oh.

276
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,136
Hmm.

277
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:22,057
Ok, sir, you're a Lebowski,
I'm a Lebowski,

278
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:22,933
That's terrific.

279
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:27,229
But I知 very busy,
as I imagine you are.

280
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:29,147
What can I
do for you, sir?

281
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,024
Uh, well, sir,
it's, uh,

282
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,526
this rug I have.

283
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:35,028
It really tied
the room together. Uh--

284
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,947
You told Brandt on
the phone, he told me.

285
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,324
Where do I fit in?

286
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,742
Well, uh, they were--

287
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,119
They were looking
for you, these 2 guys.

288
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,537
Uh--

289
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:44,538
I値l say it again.

290
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,457
You told Brandt on
the phone, he told me.

291
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,334
I know what happened.
Yes? Yes?

292
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,752
Oh, so you know that

293
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,754
They were trying
to piss on your rug?

294
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,631
Did I urinate
on your rug?

295
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,550
You mean, did you
personally come

296
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:57,926
and pee on my rug?

297
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,428
Hello! Do you
speak English, son?

298
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,846
Parla usted ingles?

299
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:04,224
I値l ask you again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

300
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:07,144
No, like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

301
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:08,937
I just want to
understand this, sir.

302
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,356
Every time a rug
is micturated upon

303
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,234
In this fair city, I have
to compensate the person--

304
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,652
Come on, man,

305
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,654
I'm not trying
io scam anybody here.

306
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,531
Uh, you know,
I--I was just--

307
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,450
You were just
looking for a handout

308
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,327
like every other...

309
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,246
Are you employed,
Mr. Lebowski?

310
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:27,748
Uh, wait, let me--

311
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,625
let me explain
something to you.

312
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:33,045
I am not Mr. Lebowski.
You're Mr. Lebowski.

313
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,422
I'm The Dude. So that's
what you call me,

314
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:38,717
You know, uh, that
or, uh, his Dudeness,

315
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,637
Or, uh, Duder, or, you
know, uh, el Duderino,

316
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,431
If you're not into
the whole brevity thing.

317
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:47,351
Are you employed, sir?

318
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,852
Employed?

319
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:50,354
Ha ha.

320
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,730
You don't go out
looking for a job

321
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,149
dressed like that,
do you, on a weekday?

322
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,027
Is this a--
what day is this?

323
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,946
Well, I do work, sir.

324
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,447
So if you don't mind--

325
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,740
No, I do mind.

326
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,242
Uh, The Dude minds.

327
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,118
This will not stand,
you know.

328
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,037
This aggression
will not stand, man.

329
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,956
I mean, your wife owes--

330
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,834
My wife is not
the issue here!

331
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,752
I hope that
someday my wife

332
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,754
will learn to live
on her allowance,

333
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,631
which is ample,
but if she does not,

334
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,550
that is her problem,
not mine,

335
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,051
just as the rug
is your problem,

336
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:23,428
just as every bum's
lot in life

337
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,847
is his own
responsibility,

338
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,224
regardless of who
he chooses to blame.

339
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:31,019
I didn't blame anyone
for the loss of my legs.

340
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,938
Some chinaman took them
from me in Korea.

341
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,357
But I went out
and achieved anyway.

342
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,733
Ha ha ha.

343
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,944
I cannot solve
your problems, sir,

344
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,696
only you can.

345
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:44,449
Oh, fuck it.

346
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,951
Yes, that's your answer.

347
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,327
That's your answer
to everything.

348
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,829
Tattoo it
on your forehead.

349
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,623
Your revolution is
over, Mr. Lebowski!

350
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,125
Condolences!

351
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,543
The bums lost!

352
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:57,838
My advice to you is to do
what your parents did!

353
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,756
Get a job, sir!

354
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,717
The bums will always lose!

355
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,635
Do you hear me,
Lebowski?!

356
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,555
The bums
will always lose!

357
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:09,933
How was your meeting,
Mr. Lebowski?

358
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:14,354
Ok. The old man told me to
take any rug in the house.

359
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,856
Well, enjoy,

360
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:18,233
and perhaps we'll see you
again sometime, Dude.

361
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,652
Yeah, sure, uh, if I知
in the neighborhood,

362
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,947
You know, and, uh...

363
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:27,284
I need to use the John.

364
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,336
Blow on them.

365
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,337
Huh?

366
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,465
Go ahead, blow.

367
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:45,636
You want me to blow
on your, uh, toes?

368
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,554
Uh-huh. Ha ha ha.

369
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,598
I can't blow that far.

370
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,022
Are you sure
he won't mind?

371
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,941
He really doesn't
care about anything.

372
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,817
He's a nihilist.

373
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,736
Oh, and that
must be exhausting.

374
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,238
You're not blowing.

375
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,157
Our guest has to be getting
along, Mrs. Lebowski.

376
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,869
Oh, you're Bunny.

377
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,956
I値l suck your cock
for $1,000.

378
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:17,626
Ha ha ha ha ha.

379
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,753
Wonderful woman.

380
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:21,129
We're all--we're all
very fond of her.

381
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,130
Very free-spirited.

382
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,549
Brandt can't watch,
though,

383
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,050
Or he has
to pay 100.

384
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,761
Ha ha ha.
that's marvelous.

385
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:33,392
Uh, I知 just gonna
go find a cash machine.

386
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:37,521
Whoo! Ha ha!

387
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:38,939
Slamming them
tonight.

388
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,858
You guys are
dead in the water.

389
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,152
Walter: All right!
Way to go, Donny!

390
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:47,531
If you will it,
it is no dream.

391
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,449
You're fucking
20 minutes late, man.

392
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,826
What the fuck is that?

393
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:51,827
Theodore Herzel.

394
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:52,828
Huh?

395
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,247
The state of Israel.
If you will it, Dude,

396
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:56,123
It is no dream.

397
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,624
What the fuck you
talking about, man?

398
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,543
The carrier. What's
in the fucking carrier?

399
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:00,919
Hmm?
Oh, Cynthia痴 dog.

400
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,338
I think
it's a Pomeranian.

401
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,840
I can't leave him
home alone

402
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:05,757
or he eats
the furniture.

403
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,217
I'm watching it

404
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,135
while Cynthia
and Marty Ackerman

405
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:09,052
are in Hawaii.

406
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,554
You brought a fucking
Pomeranian bowling?

407
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:11,930
What do you mean,
"brought it bowling"?

408
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,348
I didn't rent it shoes,

409
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,850
I'm not buying it
a fucking beer,

410
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,727
he's not taking
your fucking turn, Dude.

411
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,645
Man, if my
fucking ex-wife

412
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,147
asked me to take care
of her fucking dog

413
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:21,523
while she and her boyfriend
went to Honolulu,

414
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,025
I'd tell her to
go fuck herself.

415
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,443
Why can't she board it?

416
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,445
First of all, Dude,
you don't have an ex.

417
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,946
Secondly, this is
a fucking show dog

418
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,323
with fucking papers.

419
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,824
You can't board it.
It gets upset.

420
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:31,742
Its hair falls out.

421
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:32,743
Walter--

422
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,119
The fucking dog
has fucking papers.

423
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,954
Over the line!

424
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:36,955
Huh?

425
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,332
I'm sorry, Smokey,
you were over the line.

426
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,333
That's a foul.

427
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:40,834
Bullshit.
Mark it 8, Dude.

428
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:43,629
Uh, excuse me, mark it
zero. Next frame.

429
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,548
Bullshit, Walter.
Mark it 8, Dude.

430
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,550
Smokey, this is not
'nam, this is bowling.

431
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:49,426
There are rules.

432
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:51,220
Hey, Walter, come on,
it's just--

433
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,221
Hey, man, it's Smokey.

434
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,639
So his toe slipped
over a little.

435
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,641
You know, it's
just a game, man.

436
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,017
This is a league game.
This determines

437
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,644
who enters
the next round-robin.

438
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,520
Am I wrong?

439
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:00,521
Smokey: Yeah,
but I wasn't--

440
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:01,438
Am I wrong?

441
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,856
Yeah,
but I wasn't over.

442
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:03,732
Give me
the marker, Dude.

443
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:05,234
I'm marking an 8.

444
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,152
Smokey, my friend,

445
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,029
You're entering
a world of pain.

446
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,030
Walter, man.

447
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,823
You mark
that frame an 8,

448
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,450
You're entering
a world of pain.

449
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:14,826
I'm not--

450
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,745
A world of pain.

451
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:18,747
Look, Dude,
this is your partner.

452
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,124
Has the whole world
gone crazy?!

453
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,043
Am I the only one
around here

454
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:23,919
who gives a shit
about the rules?!

455
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:25,420
Mark it zero!

456
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,839
They're calling
the cops, man.

457
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,840
Put the piece away.

458
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:28,841
Mark it zero!

459
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,133
Walter, put
the piece away.

460
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:31,134
Walter--

461
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:32,553
You think I知
fucking around here?

462
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,263
Mark it zero!

463
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,646
All right,
it's fucking zero.

464
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:45,190
You happy,
you crazy fuck?

465
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,986
It's a league game,
Smoke.

466
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,739
You can't do that, man.

467
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,241
These guys, you know,
they're like me.

468
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:55,742
They're pacifists.

469
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,536
Smokey was a
conscientious objector.

470
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:59,037
You know, Dude,
I, myself,

471
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,956
dabbled in pacifism
at one point,

472
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:01,832
not in 'nam,
of course.

473
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:05,252
And you know he's got
emotional problems, man.

474
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:07,129
You mean,
beyond pacifism?

475
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,923
He's fragile,
Very fragile.

476
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:14,219
Huh. I did not know that.

477
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,138
Well,

478
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,639
it's all water
under the bridge,

479
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:20,017
and we do enter
the next round-robin.

480
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,018
Am I wrong?

481
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,436
No, you're not wrong.

482
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,353
Am I wrong?

483
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,354
You're not wrong,
Walter,

484
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:25,731
you're just an asshole!

485
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,149
Ok, then.

486
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,650
We play Quintana
and O達rien next week.

487
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,569
They should be pushovers.

488
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:33,947
Man, will you just--

489
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,324
Just take it easy,
man.

490
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,243
You know, that's your
answer for everything, Dude.

491
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,536
And let me
point out something.

492
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:42,122
Pacifism is not--look
at our current situation

493
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,041
with that
camelfucker in Iraq.

494
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,918
Pacifism is not something
to hide behind.

495
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,837
Just take it easy, man.

496
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,130
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

497
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,549
Yeah, waving
the fucking gun around?

498
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,051
Calmer than you are.

499
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,928
Will you
just take it easy?

500
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,472
Calmer than you are.

501
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,144
Dude, this is Smokey.

502
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,521
Look, I don't want to
be a hard-on about this,

503
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,022
and I know it
wasn't your fault,

504
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,441
but I just thought
it was fair to tell you

505
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,318
that Gilbert and I will be
submitting this to the league

506
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,237
and asking them to
set aside the round,

507
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,656
I don't know,
maybe forfeit it to us.

508
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,951
So, like I say, just thought,
you know, fair warning.

509
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,994
Tell Walter. I'm sorry.

510
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:26,625
Mr. Lebowski, this
is Brandt at, uh,

511
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,127
well, at
Mr. Lebowski's office.

512
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,089
Please call us as
soon as it's convenient.

513
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,342
Mr. Lebowski,
this is Bill Selliger

514
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:36,927
of the Southern Cal
Bowling League,

515
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,846
and I just got
uh, an informal report

516
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:42,224
that a member of your team,
a Walter Sobchak,

517
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:44,685
drew a firearm
during league play.

518
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:46,937
If this is true,
of course,

519
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,355
it contravenes a number
of the league's bylaws

520
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:49,857
and also article 27
of the league--

521
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,733
Man: Dude.

522
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,151
Hey, Monty.

523
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,529
Dude, I--I finally got--
I got the, uh,

524
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:57,531
the venue I wanted.

525
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:59,449
I'm performing
my dance quintet,

526
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:00,826
you know, my cycle,

527
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:02,828
at Crane Jackson's
fountain street theater

528
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,246
on Tuesday night,

529
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:06,123
and, well, I壇
love it if you came

530
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,125
and gave me notes.

531
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,043
I値l be there, man.

532
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,837
Uh...

533
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,255
Dude, uh,

534
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,632
tomorrow's
already the 10th.

535
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:18,093
Far out.

536
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,930
Oh. Oh, all right, ok.

537
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:25,475
Just, uh, just slip
the rent under my door.

538
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,438
Bill Selliger:
...serious infraction

539
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,482
and examine your standing.
Thank you.

540
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,819
Mr. Lebowski,
Brandt again.

541
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,530
Please do call us as
soon as you get in,

542
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,032
and I値l
send a limo.

543
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,450
I hope you're not
avoiding this call

544
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:42,951
because of the rug--
Ha ha ha--

545
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:45,829
Which, I assure you,
is not a problem.

546
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:48,248
We need your help,
and, uh...

547
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,626
Well, we'd very much
like to see you.

548
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,086
Thank you.
it's Brandt.

549
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,923
We've had some
terrible news.

550
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,383
Mr. Lebowski's in seclusion
in the west wing.

551
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,597
Mr. Lebowski.

552
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,188
Funny...

553
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:16,026
I can look back
on a life of achievement,

554
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:17,444
challenges met,

555
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,821
competitors bested,

556
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:22,366
obstacles overcome.

557
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,537
I've accomplished more
than most men

558
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:29,581
and without the use
of my legs.

559
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:32,251
What...

560
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:36,547
What makes a man,
Mr. Lebowski?

561
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:37,548
Dude.

562
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:39,091
Huh?

563
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,845
Uh, I--I
don't know, sir.

564
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:46,890
Is it being prepared
to do the right thing?

565
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:50,018
Whatever the cost?

566
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,437
Isn't that what
makes a man?

567
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,941
Mmm, sure, that
and a pair of testicles.

568
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:57,317
You're joking.

569
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,777
But...

570
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,030
Perhaps you're right.

571
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,950
You mind
if I do a "j"?

572
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:07,369
Bunny...

573
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:10,247
Excuse me?

574
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:13,125
Bunny Lebowski,

575
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,044
She is the light
of my life.

576
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:19,673
Are you surprised
at my tears, sir?

577
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:22,217
Fuckin' a.

578
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:30,559
Strong men also cry.

579
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:35,689
I received this fax
this morning.

580
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:39,526
As you can see,

581
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:41,945
it is a ransom note.

582
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:44,323
"We have Bunnie."

583
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,742
Written by men who
are unable to achieve

584
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,119
on a level field
of play.

585
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:50,537
"Gather one million dollars

586
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:54,249
in unmarked,
non-consecutive twenties."

587
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,250
Weaklings.

588
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,418
"Await instructions."

589
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,252
Bums!

590
00:22:57,294 --> 00:22:58,128
"No funny stuff."

591
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,048
Bummer.

592
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,424
Huh?

593
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,426
This is a bummer,
man.

594
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,428
That's, uh,
that's a bummer.

595
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:10,974
Brandt will fill you in
on the details.

596
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,447
Mr. Lebowski
is prepared to make

597
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:28,325
a generous offer to you
to act as courier

598
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,244
once we get instructions
for the money.

599
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,745
Why me, man?

600
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:34,623
He believes the culprits
might be the very people

601
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:37,543
who, uh...
soiled your rug,

602
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:38,919
and you're in
a unique position

603
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:40,838
to confirm
or disconfirm

604
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,339
that suspicion.

605
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:44,258
He thinks the
carpet pissers did this?

606
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,760
Well, Dude,
we just don't know.

607
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,730
Fucking Quintana.

608
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:24,525
That creep
can roll, man.

609
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,026
Yeah, but he's
a pervert, Dude.

610
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:27,444
Yeah.

611
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:31,323
No. He's a sex offender
with a record.

612
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:32,241
He did 6 months at chino

613
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,117
for exposing himself
to an 8-year-old.

614
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,119
When he
moved to Hollywood,

615
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,037
hHe had to go
door-to-door

616
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:39,039
to tell everyone
he was a pederast.

617
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:41,458
Donny: What's
a pederast, Walter?

618
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,293
Shut the fuck up,
Donny.

619
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:46,129
So...

620
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:47,631
How much
they give you?

621
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:49,550
20 grand, man.

622
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,552
And, of course, I still
get to keep the rug.

623
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:52,427
Just for making
the hand-off?

624
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,848
Yeah. They gave, uh,
Dude a beeper.

625
00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:57,724
Now, so whenever
these guys call--

626
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:58,725
What if it's
during a game?

627
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:01,019
Oh, I told them if it
was during league play...

628
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,437
What's during
league play?

629
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,939
Life does not
stop and start

630
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:04,857
at your convenience,

631
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,817
you miserable
piece of shit.

632
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:07,734
I figure, uh...

633
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:08,735
What's wrong
with Walter, Dude?

634
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,153
I figure
it's easy money.

635
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,154
It's all
pretty harmless.

636
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:12,531
She probably
kidnapped herself.

637
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:13,532
Huh?

638
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:14,533
What do you mean, Dude?

639
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,451
Rug pee-ers
did not do this.

640
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:17,828
Look at it.

641
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,329
A young trophy wife

642
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,248
marries this guy
for his money.

643
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,625
She figures he isn't
giving her enough.

644
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,043
You know, she owes money
all over town.

645
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:27,838
That fuckin'...
Bitch.

646
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,756
It's all goddamn
fake, man.

647
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:31,258
It's like Lenin said.

648
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,136
You look for the person
who will benefit,

649
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:36,555
and, uh, uh,
you know...

650
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:37,431
I am the walrus?

651
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:39,433
You know,
you'll, uh, uh...

652
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:40,851
You know what
I'm trying to say.

653
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:41,852
I am the walrus.

654
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:43,729
That fuckin' bitch!

655
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,730
Oh, yeah.

656
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:45,647
I am the walrus.

657
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,524
Shut the fuck up,
Donny!

658
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:50,944
V.I. Lenin. Vladimir
Ilyich Ulyanov!

659
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:51,945
What the fuck
is he talking about?

660
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:53,238
Fucking exactly
what happened.

661
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,157
That makes me
fucking sick.

662
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,158
What do you care,
Walter?

663
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,118
Those rich fucks.

664
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,037
This whole
fuckin' thing.

665
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:02,039
I did not watch
my buddies die

666
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,956
facedown in the mud

667
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:04,458
so that this
fucking strumpet,

668
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:05,834
This fucking whore--

669
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:08,253
I don't see any connection
to Vietnam, man.

670
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,254
Well, there's
a literal connection.

671
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:11,131
No, Walter, face it,
there isn't any connection.

672
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:12,633
Your roll.

673
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,051
Have it your way,
but my point is--

674
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:15,052
Your roll.

675
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:15,928
Your roll.
My point is--

676
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,721
Quintana: Are you ready
to be fucked, man?

677
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:22,643
I see you roll your way
into the semis.

678
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,019
Dios mio, man.

679
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:27,439
Liam and me, we're
gonna fuck you up.

680
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:28,857
Yeah?

681
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:31,235
Well...you know,
that's just like, uh...

682
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:34,029
Your opinion, man.

683
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:37,533
Let me tell you
something, pendejo,

684
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:40,452
you pull any
crazy shit with us,

685
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:42,829
you flash a piece out
on the lanes,

686
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:45,249
I値l take it away from you
and stick it up your ass

687
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,042
and pull
The fuckin' trigger

688
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:49,294
till it goes click.

689
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:51,338
Jesus.

690
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,840
You said it, man.

691
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:57,261
Nobody fucks
with the Jesus.

692
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,767
8-year-olds, Dude.

693
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:28,625
# La-la la-la-la-la

00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:54,026
# Nearly any task #

701
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,945
# And as for compensation #

702
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:59,323
# There's little
he will ask #

703
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:00,824
# Aah! #

704
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:04,036
# Take a woman
like you #

705
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:06,121
# To get through #

706
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:08,081
# To the man in me #

707
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:14,129
# The storm clouds
are raging #

708
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:17,549
# All around my door #

709
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,426
# I think to myself #

710
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:23,722
# I might not take it
anymore #

711
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:26,725
# Take a woman
like your kind #

712
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:28,519
# To find #

713
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,396
# The man in me #

714
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:35,734
# But oh-ohh #

715
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:38,695
# What a wonderful feeling #

716
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:45,577
# Just to know
that you are near... #

717
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,668
Ohh, man.

718
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:56,964
Ohh!

719
00:29:58,382 --> 00:29:59,383
Ohh...

720
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:04,054
They called about
80 minutes ago.

721
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:04,930
They want you
to take the money,

722
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:06,932
drive north on the 405.
They will call you

723
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:08,851
on the portable phone
with instructions

724
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:09,726
n about 40 minutes.

725
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,728
One person only. They
were very clear on that,

726
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,647
Or I壇 go with you.
One person only.

727
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:14,648
What happened to your jaw?

728
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,692
Oh, nothin',
you know.

729
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:19,486
Here's the money.

730
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:21,822
And the phone.

731
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:24,741
Please, Dude, follow whatever
instructions they give.

732
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:25,742
All right.

733
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:28,036
Her life is in your hands.

734
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:29,037
Oh, man,
don't say that.

735
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,956
Mr. Lebowski asked me
to repeat that.

736
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:31,957
Her life is in your hands.

737
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:32,833
Oh, shit, man.

738
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,252
Her life is in
your hands, Dude.

739
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:37,671
Report back to us
as soon as it's done.

740
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:48,223
Where the fuck
are you goin', man?

741
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:49,725
Take the ringer.
I値l drive.

742
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,643
What? The what?

743
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,020
The ringer.

744
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:54,980
The ringer,
Dude.

745
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:04,531
Have they
Called yet? What the--

746
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:05,949
What the hell is this?

747
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:07,451
My dirty undies,
Dude.

748
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:08,827
Laundry.
The whites.

749
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:11,246
Walter, I知 sure
there's a reason

750
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:12,748
you brought
your dirty undies, man.

751
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,124
That's right, Dude.
The weight.

752
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,043
The ringer
cannot look empty.

753
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:17,920
Walter, what the fuck
are you thinking, man?

754
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:19,922
You're right, Dude.
I got to thinking.

755
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,256
I got to thinking
why should we settle

756
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:22,758
for a measly fuckin'
20 grand--

757
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,134
We? What the fuck we?

758
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:25,552
You said you just wanted
to come along.

759
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:26,553
My point, Dude, is

760
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:27,930
why should we
settle for 20 grand

761
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:29,932
when we can keep
the entire million?

762
00:31:29,973 --> 00:31:31,850
Am I wrong?
Yes, you're wrong.

763
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,227
This isn't
a fuckin' game, man.

764
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:35,646
Oh, but it is a game.
You said so yourself.

765
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,231
She kidnapped herself.

766
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:38,190
I said I thought--

767
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,447
Dude here.

768
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:47,324
Man, German accent:
Who is this?

769
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:50,118
Dude the bagman, man.
Where do you want us to go?

770
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,578
Us?

771
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:53,497
Shit!

772
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:58,252
Yeah, you know,
me and the driver.

773
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:00,754
I'm not handling the money,
driving the car,

774
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:02,130
and talking on the phone
all by my--

775
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:03,423
Shut the fuck up!

776
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:04,925
Dude, are you
fuckin' this up?

777
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:06,468
Who is that?

778
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:09,221
That is the driver.

779
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:11,640
I told you--

780
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:12,641
Shit!

781
00:32:12,683 --> 00:32:13,642
What the fuck's
goin' on?

782
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:15,519
Walter! What the fuck
is goin' on?

783
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:16,436
He hung up, man!

784
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:19,356
You fucked it up!

785
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:20,858
Her life was
in our hands, man.

786
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:21,733
Easy, Dude.

787
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:23,652
We're screwed now.
We don't get shit.

788
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:25,654
They're gonna kill her.

789
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:26,530
We're fucked, Walter.

790
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:28,240
Nothing is fucked,
Dude.

791
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:30,617
Come on, you're
being very un-Dude.

792
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,035
They'll call back.

793
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:33,579
Look,
she kidnapped--

794
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:36,331
You see? Nothing's
fucked here, Dude.

795
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:37,833
Nothing is fucked.

796
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,751
They're a bunch of
fuckin' amateurs!

797
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:42,546
Hey, Walter, will you
just shut the fuck up?

798
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:44,923
Don't say peep while I知
doin' business here, man.

799
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:46,884
Ok, Dude,
have it your way.

800
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:50,220
But they're amateurs.

801
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:51,263
Fuck.

802
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:54,057
Dude.

803
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:55,017
Ok, we proceed.

804
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,935
But only if there's
no funny stuff.

805
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:58,437
Yeah, yeah.

806
00:32:58,478 --> 00:32:59,855
So no funny stuff, ok?

807
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:03,358
Just tell me where the fuck
you want us to go.

808
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:08,155
That was the sign, man.

809
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:12,159
So all we gotta do
is get her back,

810
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,244
No one's in a position
to complain,

811
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:16,246
And we keep
the baksheesh.

812
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,122
Yeah, terrific, Walter,

813
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:19,124
but you haven't told me how
we're gonna get her back.

814
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:20,042
Where is she?

815
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,543
That's the simple part,
Dude.

816
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:22,920
We make the hand-off,

817
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:25,339
I grab one of 'em,
beat it out of him.

818
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,840
Huh?

819
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:28,258
Yeah. That's
a great plan.

820
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,719
Walter, that's
fucking ingenious,

821
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,054
If I understand it
correctly.

822
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:33,555
It's a Swiss
fuckin' watch.

823
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:34,431
That's right, Dude.

824
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:36,350
The beauty of this
is its simplicity.

825
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,227
Once a plan
gets too complex,

826
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:39,645
everything
can go wrong.

827
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:41,688
If there's one thing I
learned in 'nam, it's--

828
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:46,443
Dude.

829
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:48,320
You're coming
to a wooden bridge.

830
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:49,738
When you cross
the bridge,

831
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,739
you throw the bag

832
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:52,658
from the left window
of the moving car.

833
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,159
You're being watched.

834
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:56,036
Fuck!

835
00:33:56,078 --> 00:33:57,454
What'd he say?
Where's the hand-off?

836
00:33:57,496 --> 00:33:58,956
There is no fuckin'
hand-off, man.

837
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:00,832
At the wooden bridge, we throw
the money out of the car.

838
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:01,917
Huh?

839
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,752
We throw the money
out of the moving car.

840
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:06,129
No, we can't
do that, Dude.

841
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:07,923
That fucks up
our plan.

842
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:09,925
Well, call 'em up and
explain it to them, Walter.

843
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:11,426
Your plan
is so fuckin' simple

844
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:12,845
I'm sure they'll
fuckin' understand it.

845
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:14,346
That's the beauty of it.

846
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:15,222
Wooden bridge, huh?

847
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:16,223
I'm throwin' the money,
Walter.

848
00:34:16,265 --> 00:34:17,641
We're not fuckin'
around, man.

849
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:19,142
Ok, Dude,
bridge is comin' up.

850
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:20,018
Give me the ringer,
chop-chop.

851
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,520
Fuck that, Walter.
I love ya,

852
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:23,939
but sooner or later you're
gonna have to face the fact

853
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:24,940
you're a goddamn moron.

854
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:26,358
Ok, Dude.
No time to argue.

855
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,317
Hey, man.
The bridge.

856
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,235
Hey, Walter! Hey!

857
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:29,736
Walter, hey!

858
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:31,572
There goes the ringer!

859
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:33,949
What the fuck?!

860
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:35,325
Here, Dude, your wheel.

861
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,619
At 15 mph, I roll out.

862
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:39,246
I double back, grab one,
and beat it out of him.

863
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:40,622
The Uzi.
Uzi?!

864
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:42,541
You didn't think I was
rolling out of here naked?

865
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:43,542
W-Walter, please--

866
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,460
15, Dude. This is it.
Let's take that hill!

867
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:52,259
Whoo-hoo-oo.

868
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:02,269
Aah...aah.

869
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:13,238
We have it!

870
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,782
We...have it!

871
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:30,923
Aw, fuck it, Dude.

872
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:32,466
Let's go bowling.

873
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:08,585
Ah.

874
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:10,921
Etz chaim he, Dude,

875
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:12,840
as the ex used to say.

876
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:14,758
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

877
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,552
What the fuck are we
gonna tell Lebowski?

878
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:17,553
Huh?

879
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:19,471
Oh, him. Uh...

880
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:22,850
Well, uh, what exactly
is the problem?

881
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:24,893
The problem is--

882
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:26,770
What do you mean,
What's the--

883
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:29,022
There was no...

884
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:31,567
We--we didn't, uh...

885
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:34,820
They're gonna kill
that poor woman, man.

886
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:36,238
What the fuck are you
talking about?

887
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,239
The poor woman--

888
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:38,240
that poor slut

889
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:39,157
kidnapped herself.

890
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,742
Come on, Dude,
you said so yourself.

891
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:42,619
Man, I said I thought
she kidnapped herself.

892
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:43,954
You're the one who's
so fuckin' certain.

893
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,455
That's right, Dude.

894
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:46,957
100% certain.

895
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:48,417
They posted the next round
for the tournament.

896
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,836
Donny, shut the fuck--
when do we play?

897
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:51,628
This Saturday.
Quintana and--

898
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,630
Saturday? Well, they
have to reschedule.

899
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:56,049
Walter, what am I
gonna tell Lebowski?

900
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:58,427
I told that fuck down
at the league office--

901
00:36:58,468 --> 00:36:59,845
Who's in charge Walter--
of scheduling?

902
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:00,846
Burkhalter.

903
00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:02,723
I told that kraut
a fuckin' thousand times

904
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:03,849
I don't roll
on Shabbos.

905
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:05,225
He already Walter--
posted it.

906
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:06,727
Well, he can fuckin'
unpost it!

907
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:08,145
Who gives a shit?!

908
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:09,938
They're gonna kill
that poor woman, man.

909
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,440
What am I gonna tell
Lebowski?

910
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:12,357
Come on, Dude,

911
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:13,817
eventually she'll get tired
of her little game

912
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,235
and, you know,
wander on back.

913
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:16,737
How come you don't roll
on Saturday, Walter?

914
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:17,654
I'm Shomer Shabbos.

915
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,655
What's that, Walter?

916
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:19,531
Yeah,
and in the meantime,

917
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:21,033
What do I tell
Lebowski?

918
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,451
Saturday, Donny,
is Shabbos,

919
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:24,328
The jewish day of rest.
That means I don't work,

920
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:27,247
I don't drive a car,
I don't fuckin' ride in a car,

921
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:29,249
I don't handle money,
I don't turn on the oven,

922
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:31,627
and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!

923
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:33,045
Sheesh.

924
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:34,963
Shomer Shabbos!

925
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:37,758
Walter,
How am I gonna--

926
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:39,218
Shomer fucking Shabbos.

927
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:41,136
Oh, fuck! That's it!
I'm outta here.

928
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:42,679
Oh, come on, Dude.

929
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:46,433
Dude! Dude!

930
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:49,353
Look, you just tell him--

931
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:50,729
Tell him we made the drop,

932
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:52,147
and everything went,
you know...

933
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:53,232
Oh, yeah,
how'd it go?

934
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:55,025
Went all right. Dude's car
got a little dinged up.

935
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:57,444
Walter, we didn't make
the fuckin' hand-off, man.

936
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:59,446
They didn't get
the fuckin' money!

937
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:00,822
And they're gonna--
they're gonna--

938
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:02,324
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

939
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:05,035
They're gonna kill
that poor woman

940
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:06,537
Hey, Walter, if you
can't ride in a car,

941
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:07,955
how do you get around
on shammos?

942
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:09,456
Really, Dude,
you surprise me.

943
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:12,334
They're not gonna kill shit,
they're not gonna do shit.

944
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:13,252
What can they do to her?

945
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:14,253
They're a bunch
of fuckin' amateurs,

946
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:15,629
And meanwhile,
look at the bottom line.

947
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:17,631
Who's sittin' on
a million fucking dollars?

948
00:38:17,673 --> 00:38:19,132
Am I wrong? Walter--

949
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:21,051
Who's got a fuckin' million
fuckin' dollars

950
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:22,427
sitting in the trunk
of our car?

951
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:23,428
Our car, Walter?

952
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,347
And what do they got?
My dirty undies.

953
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:27,266
My fuckin' whites.

954
00:38:32,563 --> 00:38:34,439
Say, Dude.

955
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:35,899
Where is your car?

956
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:38,235
Who's got your
undies, Walter?

957
00:38:38,277 --> 00:38:39,236
Where's your car, Dude?

958
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:41,697
You don't know,
Walter?

959
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:44,533
It was parked
in a handicap zone.

960
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:45,492
Perhaps they towed it.

961
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:49,329
You fuckin' know
it's been stolen.

962
00:38:49,371 --> 00:38:52,291
Well, certainly that's
a possibility, Dude.

963
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:54,585
Oh, fuck it.

964
00:38:57,462 --> 00:38:58,839
Donny:
Where you goin', Dude?

965
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:00,340
I'm goin' home, Donny.

966
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:02,217
Phone's ringing, Dude.

967
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:04,261
Thank you, Donny.

968
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:18,317
Uh...

969
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:20,319
Yeah, uh...

970
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,237
Green.

971
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:25,032
Some, uh, brown or...

972
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:27,451
Rust coloration.

973
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:30,329
And was there anything
of value in the car?

974
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,747
Oh. Uh, yeah.

975
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:34,625
Uh...a tape deck,

976
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:36,043
some Creedence tapes,

977
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,921
and there was a, uh...

978
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:41,965
Uh, my briefcase.

979
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:45,677
In the briefcase?

980
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:48,555
Uh, uh, papers.

981
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:50,557
You know, um,
just papers.

982
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:53,727
Uh, you know,
uh, my papers.

983
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:55,270
Business papers.

984
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,524
And what do you do,
Sir?

985
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:00,067
I'm unemployed.

986
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:05,948
My rug was
also stolen.

987
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:07,824
Your rug was in the car?

988
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:08,784
No, here.

989
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:12,162
Separate incidents?

990
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:15,541
Answering machine:
The Dude is not in.

991
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:19,253
Do you find them much,
these stolen cars?

992
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:21,630
Sometimes.

993
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:23,632
Wouldn't hold out much hope
for the tape deck, though.

994
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:25,551
Or the Creedence.

995
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:28,470
Well, what about, uh...

996
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:30,222
The briefcase?

997
00:40:30,264 --> 00:40:31,640
Woman: Mr. Lebowski,
I'd like to see you.

998
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:33,642
Call when you get home,
and I値l send a car for you.

999
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:34,518
My name is Maude Lebowski.

1000
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,937
I'm the one
who took your rug.

1001
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:37,938
Whoa.

1002
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,984
Guess we can close
the file on that one.

1003
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,475
Huh.

1004
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:29,448
Woman: El Franco,
ay`dame abajo.

1005
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:32,993
I値l be with you
in a moment, Mr. Lebowski.

1006
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:53,347
Does the female form make you
uncomfortable, Mr. Lebowski?

1007
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:55,849
Uh, is that what this
is a picture of?

1008
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:57,351
In a sense, yes.

1009
00:41:57,392 --> 00:42:00,145
My art has been commended
as being strongly vaginal,

1010
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:01,146
which bothers some men.

1011
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:04,024
The word itself makes
some men uncomfortable.

1012
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:05,317
Vagina.

1013
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,818
Oh, yeah?

1014
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,737
Yes, they don't like hearing it
and find it difficult to say,

1015
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:10,155
whereas without
batting an eye,

1016
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:12,157
a man will refer to
his dick or his rod

1017
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:14,576
Or his... Johnson.

1018
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:16,453
Johnson?

1019
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:17,829
All right, Mr. Lebowski.

1020
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:19,331
Let's get down to cases.

1021
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:21,750
My father told me he agreed
to let you have the rug,

1022
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:24,127
but as it was a gift
from me to my late mother,

1023
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:25,128
it was not his to give.

1024
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,547
Now--

1025
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:28,423
Your face.

1026
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:30,342
As for this kidnapping...

1027
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:31,844
Huh?

1028
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:33,136
Yes, I know all about it,

1029
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:34,638
And I know that
you acted as courier.

1030
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,056
Let me tell you something.

1031
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:37,558
The whole thing stinks
to high heaven.

1032
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:38,934
Yeah...

1033
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:40,853
Right, but let me
explain something

1034
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:42,354
About the rug.

1035
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:44,731
Do you like sex,
Mr. Lebowski?

1036
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:45,649
Excuse me?

1037
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:48,026
Sex. The physical act
of love. Coitus.

1038
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:49,528
Do you like it?

1039
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,446
I was talking
about my rug.

1040
00:42:51,488 --> 00:42:53,323
You're not interested
in sex?

1041
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:54,825
You mean coitus?

1042
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:55,742
I like it, too.

1043
00:42:55,784 --> 00:42:57,744
It's a male myth
about feminists

1044
00:42:57,786 --> 00:42:58,620
That we hate sex.

1045
00:42:58,662 --> 00:43:00,956
It can be a natural,
zesty enterprise.

1046
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:02,457
However, there
are some people--

1047
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:05,335
It is called satyriasis in men,
nymphomania in women--

1048
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:08,130
who engage in it compulsively
and without joy.

1049
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:09,131
Oh, no.

1050
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:11,049
Oh, yes, Mr. Lebowski.

1051
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,552
These unfortunate souls
cannot love

1052
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:15,053
in the true sense
of the word.

1053
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:18,348
Our mutual acquaintance
Bunny is one of these.

1054
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,850
Listen, Maude,

1055
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:23,645
um, I知 sorry if your
stepmother is a nympho,

1056
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:25,147
but, you know,

1057
00:43:25,189 --> 00:43:27,441
I don't see what this
has to do with, uh...

1058
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:28,817
Do you have any Kahlua?

1059
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:30,736
Take a look
at this, sir.

1060
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:32,070
Hmm?

1061
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:35,199
Oh, I know that guy.

1062
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,077
He's a nihilist.

1063
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:55,719
Hi.

1064
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:57,638
Hello. Meine dispatcher says

1065
00:43:57,679 --> 00:43:59,556
there's something wrong
mitt deine kable.

1066
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:01,433
Yeah, come on in.
I'm not really sure

1067
00:44:01,475 --> 00:44:03,435
exactly what's really
wrong with the cable.

1068
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:05,354
Zat's why they sent me.
I am an expert.

1069
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:06,730
The TV痴 in here.

1070
00:44:06,772 --> 00:44:08,774
You recognize her,
of course.

1071
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,446
Bunny: Oh, that's
my friend Shari.

1072
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:16,323
She just came over
to use the shower.

1073
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:18,325
The story
is ludicrous.

1074
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:21,620
Meine nommen is Karl.
Ich bin expert.

1075
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:23,121
You must be here
to fix the cable.

1076
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:26,458
Maude: Lord, you can imagine
where it goes from here.

1077
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,835
He fixes the cable?

1078
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:29,253
Don't be fatuous,
Jeffrey.

1079
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:31,630
Little matter to me
that this woman chose

1080
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:33,131
to pursue a career
in pornography

1081
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:35,551
nor that she has been
"banging" Jackie Treehorn,

1082
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:37,427
to use the parlance
of our times,

1083
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:38,929
however,

1084
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:41,723
I am one of the 2 trustees
of the Lebowski Foundation,

1085
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:43,225
the other being my father.

1086
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:45,143
The Foundation takes
youngsters from watts and--

1087
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:46,520
Shit, yeah,
the achievers.

1088
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:48,021
Little Lebowski
urban achievers, yes,

1089
00:44:48,063 --> 00:44:49,940
and proud we are
of all of them,

1090
00:44:49,982 --> 00:44:52,818
I asked my father about
his withdrawal of $1 million

1091
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,819
from the Foundation account,

1092
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,737
and he told me
about this abduction.

1093
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:57,155
But I tell you,
it is preposterous.

1094
00:44:57,197 --> 00:44:58,657
This compulsive fornicator

1095
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:01,034
is taking my father
for the proverbial ride.

1096
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:01,952
Yeah, but my--

1097
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:02,953
I'm getting to your rug.

1098
00:45:02,995 --> 00:45:04,830
My father and I
don't get along.

1099
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:06,331
He doesn't approve
of my lifestyle,

1100
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:08,250
and, needless to say,
I don't approve of his.

1101
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:11,128
However, I hardly wish to make
my father's embezzlement

1102
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:12,045
a police matter,

1103
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:14,840
so I知 proposing that you
try to recover the money

1104
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:16,341
from the people
you delivered it to.

1105
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:19,636
Well, uh,
I could do that.

1106
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:22,639
If you successfully do so,
I will compensate you

1107
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:27,019
to the tune of 10%
of the recovered sum.

1108
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:27,936
A hundred...

1109
00:45:27,978 --> 00:45:30,355
Thousand. Yes.
Bones or clams

1110
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:31,356
Or whatever you call them.

1111
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:33,734
Yeah, but--but, uh...

1112
00:45:33,775 --> 00:45:35,152
What about my, uh...

1113
00:45:35,194 --> 00:45:37,154
Your rug, yes.
well, with that money

1114
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:38,530
you can buy
any number of rugs

1115
00:45:38,572 --> 00:45:40,324
That don't have
sentimental value for me.

1116
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:43,243
And I am sorry about
that crack on the jaw.

1117
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:46,121
Oh, th-that's fine.
That doesn't even, uh...

1118
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:47,122
Here's the name and number
of a doctor

1119
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:49,041
who will look at it
for you.

1120
00:45:49,082 --> 00:45:49,958
You will receive no bill.

1121
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,418
He's a good man,
and thorough.

1122
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,837
Th-that's thoughtful,
But--

1123
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:54,838
Please see him, Jeffrey.

1124
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,757
He's a good man,
and thorough.

1125
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:58,634
Oh, well...

1126
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:00,177
All right.
All right.

1127
00:46:01,595 --> 00:46:02,930
So he says, "My wife's
a pain in the ass.

1128
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:04,932
She's always bustin'
my friggin' agates.

1129
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:08,143
My daughter's married
to a real loser bastard,

1130
00:46:08,185 --> 00:46:10,521
and I got a rash
so bad on my ass

1131
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:12,022
I can't even sit down.

1132
00:46:12,064 --> 00:46:14,942
But you know me, I can't
complain."

1133
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:16,818
Ah, fuckin' a, man.
I got a rash, man.

1134
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,862
Fuckin' a.

1135
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,658
I gotta tell you,
Tone, man,

1136
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:25,118
Earlier in the day, I was
really feeling shitty, man.

1137
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,037
Really down
in the dumps.

1138
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:28,455
Lost a little money...

1139
00:46:28,497 --> 00:46:31,333
Hey, you know what?
forget about it, huh?

1140
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:32,334
Forget about it.

1141
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:33,627
Yeah, fuck it, man.

1142
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:35,045
I can't be worried
about that shit.

1143
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:35,921
Life goes on, man.

1144
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:38,465
Home, sweet home,
Mr. L.

1145
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,637
Tony: Hey, yo. Look.

1146
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:45,138
Who's your friend
in the Volkswagen?

1147
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,057
Huh?

1148
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,518
Yeah, he followed us
here.

1149
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,436
When did he start foll--
Aah!

1150
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:52,437
What the fuck?!

1151
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:54,857
In the limo, you son
of a bitch. No arguing.

1152
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:57,234
Hey, careful, man.
there's a beverage here.

1153
00:46:57,276 --> 00:46:58,652
Hey!

1154
00:46:58,694 --> 00:47:00,445
Start talking

1155
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:01,446
and talk fast,
you lousy bum.

1156
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:03,323
We've been frantically
trying to reach you, Dude.

1157
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:06,368
Where's my goddamn
money, you bum?!

1158
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:08,620
W-well, we...

1159
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:09,621
I--I--I...

1160
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:10,622
They did not

1161
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:12,541
receive the money,
you nitwit!

1162
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:13,917
They did not receive
the money!

1163
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:16,336
Her life
was in your hands!

1164
00:47:16,378 --> 00:47:17,838
This is our concern,
Dude.

1165
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,257
No, man,
nothing is fucked here.

1166
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:21,133
Nothing is fucked?!

1167
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:22,134
No, man.

1168
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:23,135
The goddamn plane

1169
00:47:23,177 --> 00:47:25,554
Has crashed
into the mountain!

1170
00:47:25,596 --> 00:47:26,430
Look, man, come on.

1171
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:29,725
Who are you gonna believe,
those guys or, uh...

1172
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:31,643
We dropped off
the damn money.

1173
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:33,520
We?!

1174
00:47:33,562 --> 00:47:35,022
I.

1175
00:47:35,063 --> 00:47:36,440
The royal we.

1176
00:47:36,481 --> 00:47:37,941
You know, the editorial.

1177
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,319
I dropped off the money
exactly as per--

1178
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,655
Look. Man, I致e got certain
information, all right?

1179
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:46,533
Certain things have
come to light, and...

1180
00:47:46,575 --> 00:47:48,952
You know, has it
ever occurred to you

1181
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:52,831
that instead of, uh,
you know, running around,

1182
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:56,543
uh, blaming me, given the
nature of all this new shit,

1183
00:47:56,585 --> 00:47:59,546
th-th-this could be
a lot more, uh...

1184
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:02,424
Uh, uh, uh, complex?

1185
00:48:02,466 --> 00:48:05,844
I mean, it might not be
just such a simple, uh,

1186
00:48:05,886 --> 00:48:06,720
You know?

1187
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:08,222
What in God's
holy name

1188
00:48:08,263 --> 00:48:10,057
Are you blathering
about?

1189
00:48:10,098 --> 00:48:13,018
Well, I値l tell you what
I'm blathering about.

1190
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,436
I've got information, man.

1191
00:48:14,478 --> 00:48:16,355
New shit has come to light.

1192
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:18,774
And--and, shit, man...

1193
00:48:20,275 --> 00:48:22,694
She kidnapped herself.

1194
00:48:23,987 --> 00:48:26,448
Well, sure, man.

1195
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,243
Look at it. You know,
a young trophy wife--

1196
00:48:29,284 --> 00:48:31,245
In the parlance
of our times, you know--

1197
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:34,540
She, uh, uh, uh, owes
money all over town,

1198
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:36,500
Including to known
pornographers.

1199
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,838
And that's cool.
that-that's cool.

1200
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:44,633
I'm saying,
she needs money, man.

1201
00:48:44,675 --> 00:48:46,134
And--and, you know,

1202
00:48:46,176 --> 00:48:48,428
of course they're gonna say
they didn't get it,

1203
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:52,224
uh, uh, because
she wants more, man.

1204
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:55,769
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean, uh...

1205
00:48:57,062 --> 00:48:59,940
Hasn't that ever occurred
to you, man?

1206
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:02,276
Sir?

1207
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,736
No, Mr. Lebowski,

1208
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:06,738
it had not occurred
to me.

1209
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,657
That had not occurred
to us, Dude.

1210
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:10,534
Well, ok, you know,

1211
00:49:10,576 --> 00:49:13,036
you guys aren't privy
to all the new shit, so...

1212
00:49:13,078 --> 00:49:15,747
Uh, you know. But...

1213
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:19,293
Hey, that's what you--
that's what you pay me for.

1214
00:49:20,586 --> 00:49:23,422
Speaking of which,
do you think that you could, uh,

1215
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:25,841
give me my 20,000 in cash?

1216
00:49:25,883 --> 00:49:28,719
My concern is--and I gotta
check with my accountant--

1217
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,138
but this might bump me
into a higher tax, uh--

1218
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,139
Brandt...

1219
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:34,057
Give him
the envelope.

1220
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:37,436
Oh, well, if you've already
got the check made out,

1221
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:38,520
Th-that's cool.

1222
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:40,981
We received this
this morning.

1223
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:45,652
Since you have
failed to achieve,

1224
00:49:45,694 --> 00:49:49,031
even in the modest task
which was your charge,

1225
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:52,826
since you have
stolen my money,

1226
00:49:52,868 --> 00:49:56,246
since you have unrepentantly
betrayed my trust...

1227
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:57,623
I have no choice

1228
00:49:57,664 --> 00:50:02,544
but to tell these bums to do
whatever is necessary

1229
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:06,340
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

1230
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:09,134
And with Brandt
as my witness,

1231
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:10,552
I will tell you this:

1232
00:50:10,594 --> 00:50:14,431
Any further harm
visited upon Bunny

1233
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:19,186
will be visited tenfold
upon your head.

1234
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:25,943
By god, sir, I will not
abide another toe.

1235
00:50:25,984 --> 00:50:31,323
# I hear the cottonwoods
whisperin' above #

1236
00:50:31,365 --> 00:50:34,743
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

1237
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:36,453
Whose toe was it,
Walter?

1238
00:50:36,495 --> 00:50:37,454
How the fuck should I know?

1239
00:50:37,496 --> 00:50:39,831
I do know that nothing
about it indicates--

1240
00:50:39,873 --> 00:50:41,250
Man, the nail
polish, Walter.

1241
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:42,751
Fine, Dude.

1242
00:50:42,793 --> 00:50:44,628
As if it's impossible
to get some nail polish,

1243
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,046
Apply it
To someone else's toe.

1244
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:47,548
Someone else's--

1245
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:49,424
Where the fuck
are they gonna get--

1246
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:51,343
You want a toe?
I can get you a toe.

1247
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:53,720
Believe me,
there are ways, Dude.

1248
00:50:53,762 --> 00:50:55,639
You don't wanna know
about it, believe me.

1249
00:50:55,681 --> 00:50:57,641
Hell, I can get you a toe
by 3:00 this afternoon,

1250
00:50:57,683 --> 00:50:58,517
with nail polish.

1251
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,519
These fuckin' amateurs.

1252
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:01,520
Walter--

1253
00:51:01,562 --> 00:51:02,938
They send us a toe,

1254
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,356
we're supposed to shit
ourselves with fear.

1255
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:05,357
Jesus Christ. Walter--

1256
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:06,233
Now, the point is--

1257
00:51:06,275 --> 00:51:07,734
They're gonna kill her,
Walter,

1258
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:09,653
And then they're gonna
kill me.

1259
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:11,530
Dude...

1260
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:13,031
That's...

1261
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:14,950
That's just the stress
talking, man.

1262
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:17,828
Now so far we have
what appears to me

1263
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:20,247
To be a series of
victimless crimes.

1264
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:21,123
What about the toe?

1265
00:51:21,164 --> 00:51:22,624
Forget about
the fucking toe!

1266
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:24,543
Excuse me, sir,

1267
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:25,919
Could you please
keep your voices down?

1268
00:51:25,961 --> 00:51:27,421
This is a family restaurant.

1269
00:51:27,462 --> 00:51:28,755
Oh, please, dear.

1270
00:51:28,797 --> 00:51:30,757
For your information,
the supreme court

1271
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:33,135
has roundly rejected
prior restraint!

1272
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:35,053
Walter, this is not
a first amendment thing.

1273
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:36,430
If you don't calm down,

1274
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:37,931
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

1275
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:41,226
Lady, I got buddies who
died face down in the muck

1276
00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:44,146
so you and I could enjoy
this family restaurant!

1277
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:45,647
All right,
I'm outta here.

1278
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:47,024
Hey, Dude,
don't go away, man.

1279
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:48,942
Come on, this affects
all of us, man.

1280
00:51:48,984 --> 00:51:51,278
Our basic freedoms!

1281
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:56,658
I'm stayin'.

1282
00:51:58,577 --> 00:52:01,079
I'm finishing my coffee.

1283
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:07,294
Enjoying my coffee.

1284
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:24,937
Answering machine:
The Dude is not in.

1285
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:26,855
Leave a message
after the beep.

1286
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:28,273
Thanks, man.

1287
00:52:29,274 --> 00:52:31,235
Mr. Lebowski, this is
duty officer Rolvaag

1288
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:32,653
of the LAPD.

1289
00:52:32,694 --> 00:52:34,154
We've recovered
your automobile.

1290
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:36,448
It can be claimed at the
North Hollywood auto circus

1291
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:37,324
there on Victory.

1292
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:38,825
Far out, man.

1293
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:40,369
Far fucking out!

1294
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:50,838
H-hey!

1295
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:53,382
This is a private
residence, man.

1296
00:53:00,973 --> 00:53:03,976
Ah, nice marmot.

1297
00:53:07,479 --> 00:53:08,689
Aah!

1298
00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:12,442
Aaaahhh!

1299
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:17,155
Ve vant the money,
Lebowski.

1300
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:18,574
Aah!

1301
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:23,954
You think
ve are kidding

1302
00:53:23,996 --> 00:53:25,831
Or making with
the funny stuff?

1303
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:26,832
There are things

1304
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:28,750
you haven't dreamed of,
Lebowski.

1305
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:29,751
Ja. Ve believe
in nothing.

1306
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:31,628
He believes in nothing,
Lebowski, nothing.

1307
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,046
and tomorrow
ve come back

1308
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:34,047
and ve cut off
your chonson.

1309
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:35,424
Excuse me?

1310
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:36,925
I said we'll cut off
Your Johnson!

1311
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:39,344
Just think about that,
Lebowski.

1312
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:42,347
Ja, your viggly penis,
Lebowski.

1313
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:46,268
Ja, and maybe we stomp on it
and sqoosh it, Lebowski.

1314
00:53:52,774 --> 00:53:55,152
Man: It was discovered
last night in Van Nuys

1315
00:53:55,194 --> 00:53:57,654
lodged against
an abutment.

1316
00:53:57,696 --> 00:53:58,655
Oh, man, lodged where?

1317
00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:00,532
You're lucky she
didn't get chopped,

1318
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:01,533
Mr. Lebowski.

1319
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:02,534
Oh, man!

1320
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:03,952
Must've been
a joyride situation.

1321
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:05,329
They abandoned
the vehicle

1322
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:06,330
once they hit
the retaining wall.

1323
00:54:06,371 --> 00:54:08,248
Oh, my
fucking briefcase!

1324
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:10,125
Man, it's not here.
Shit!

1325
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:11,043
Yeah, I saw that
on the report. Sorry.

1326
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:13,921
You gotta get in
on the other side.

1327
00:54:13,962 --> 00:54:16,840
The side-view was
found on the road

1328
00:54:16,882 --> 00:54:19,218
by the car.

1329
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:21,136
You're lucky they left
the tape deck, though,

1330
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:23,055
And the Creedence.

1331
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:26,433
Aw, Jesus!
What's that smell, man?

1332
00:54:26,475 --> 00:54:28,352
Probably a vagrant
slept in the car

1333
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:31,230
or maybe just used it
as a toilet and moved on.

1334
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:32,773
Hey, man...

1335
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:36,026
Are you gonna find
these guys or, you know,

1336
00:54:36,068 --> 00:54:39,446
I mean, you got any
promising, uh, leads or...

1337
00:54:39,488 --> 00:54:40,822
Leads?

1338
00:54:40,864 --> 00:54:43,242
Yeah. Sure.

1339
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:45,244
I値l just check
with the boys

1340
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:46,119
down at
the crime lab.

1341
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:48,539
They, uh, got
4 more detectives

1342
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,040
Working on the case.

1343
00:54:50,082 --> 00:54:52,417
They got us
working in shifts.

1344
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:54,378
Ha ha ha!

1345
00:54:56,797 --> 00:54:58,632
Leads.

1346
00:54:58,674 --> 00:55:02,052
My only hope is that
the big Lebowski kills me

1347
00:55:02,094 --> 00:55:03,846
Before the Germans
can cut my dick off.

1348
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,722
Now, that is just
ridiculous, Dude.

1349
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:07,140
No one's going to
cut your dick off.

1350
00:55:07,182 --> 00:55:08,517
Thank you, Walter.

1351
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,018
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

1352
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:10,936
Thank you, Walter.

1353
00:55:10,978 --> 00:55:12,938
That makes me feel
very secure.

1354
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,856
Dude.

1355
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:15,440
That makes me feel
very warm inside.

1356
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:16,358
Now, Dude.

1357
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,735
This whole
fuckin' thing.

1358
00:55:18,777 --> 00:55:19,736
I could be sitting here

1359
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:22,155
with just pee stains
on my rug.

1360
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:23,156
Yeah.

1361
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:24,533
But, no, man,
I gotta, you know.

1362
00:55:24,575 --> 00:55:25,534
Fucking Germans.

1363
00:55:25,576 --> 00:55:27,452
Nothing changes.

1364
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:29,329
Fucking Nazis.

1365
00:55:29,371 --> 00:55:30,247
They were Nazis, Dude?

1366
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:31,623
Oh, come on, Donny.

1367
00:55:31,665 --> 00:55:33,542
They were threatening
castration.

1368
00:55:33,584 --> 00:55:35,043
Are we gonna
split hairs here?

1369
00:55:35,085 --> 00:55:36,044
No.

1370
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:36,920
Am I wrong?

1371
00:55:36,962 --> 00:55:37,921
Well, he--he--

1372
00:55:37,963 --> 00:55:39,339
They were
nihilists, man.

1373
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:40,340
Huh?

1374
00:55:40,382 --> 00:55:42,217
They kept saying
they believed in nothing.

1375
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:44,261
Nihilists.

1376
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:46,680
Fuck me.

1377
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:48,932
I mean,
say what you want

1378
00:55:48,974 --> 00:55:50,434
about the tenets

1379
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:51,351
of national
Socialism, Dude.

1380
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:52,853
At least
it's an ethos.

1381
00:55:52,895 --> 00:55:54,730
And also,
let's not forget--

1382
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:56,231
Let痴 not forget,
Dude--

1383
00:55:56,273 --> 00:55:58,025
That keeping
wildlife, um,

1384
00:55:58,066 --> 00:55:59,443
an amphibious rodent

1385
00:55:59,484 --> 00:56:01,820
for, um, you know,
domestic...

1386
00:56:01,862 --> 00:56:04,740
Within the city...

1387
00:56:04,781 --> 00:56:06,241
That ain't legal
either.

1388
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:08,118
What are you,
a fucking park ranger now?

1389
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,037
No, I知
just trying--

1390
00:56:10,078 --> 00:56:12,456
Who gives a shit
about the fucking marmot?

1391
00:56:12,497 --> 00:56:14,333
We are sympathizing
here, Dude.

1392
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:15,417
Fuck sympathy.

1393
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:17,836
I don't need your
fucking sympathy, man.

1394
00:56:17,878 --> 00:56:20,255
I need my
fucking Johnson.

1395
00:56:20,297 --> 00:56:21,632
What do you need
that for, Dude?

1396
00:56:21,673 --> 00:56:23,133
You have got to
buck up, man!

1397
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:24,927
You cannot drag
this negative energy

1398
00:56:24,968 --> 00:56:26,428
Into the tournament.

1399
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,889
Fuck the tournament.
Fuck you, Walter.

1400
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:33,644
Fuck the tournament?

1401
00:56:33,685 --> 00:56:35,020
Ok, Dude. I can see

1402
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:36,021
you don't want to be
cheered up here.

1403
00:56:36,063 --> 00:56:36,939
Come on, Donny.

1404
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,398
Let's go get us
a lane.

1405
00:56:43,278 --> 00:56:45,155
Another Caucasian, Gary.

1406
00:56:45,197 --> 00:56:46,573
Right, Dude.

1407
00:56:48,075 --> 00:56:49,952
Friends like these,
huh, Gary?

1408
00:56:49,993 --> 00:56:51,870
That's right, Dude.

1409
00:57:13,976 --> 00:57:16,353
Do you have
A good sarsaparilla?

1410
00:57:16,395 --> 00:57:18,647
Bartender:
Sioux city sarsaparilla?

1411
00:57:18,689 --> 00:57:21,191
Yeah. That痴 a good one.

1412
00:57:23,485 --> 00:57:25,320
How you doin'
there, Dude?

1413
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:27,739
Not too good, man.

1414
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:29,741
One of those days, huh?

1415
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:31,618
Yeah.

1416
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,536
Well...

1417
00:57:32,578 --> 00:57:36,456
A wiser fella than myself
once said,

1418
00:57:36,498 --> 00:57:39,334
"Sometimes you eat
the bar and--"

1419
00:57:39,376 --> 00:57:41,336
Much obliged.

1420
00:57:41,378 --> 00:57:44,631
"And sometimes
the bar, well...

1421
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:46,049
He eats you."

1422
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:49,344
Hmm. That some kind
of eastern thing?

1423
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:51,388
Far from it.

1424
00:57:57,186 --> 00:58:00,022
I like your style,
Dude.

1425
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,940
Hmm. Well...

1426
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:04,318
I dig your style, too,
man.

1427
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:07,279
You got
a whole cowboy thing going.

1428
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:11,950
Thankie.

1429
00:58:11,992 --> 00:58:14,453
There's just one thing,
Dude.

1430
00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:15,829
And what's that?

1431
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:19,374
Do you have to use
so many cuss words?

1432
00:58:21,668 --> 00:58:23,670
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1433
00:58:25,464 --> 00:58:26,423
Ok, Dude,

1434
00:58:26,465 --> 00:58:29,343
Have it your way.

1435
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:32,221
Take her easy, Dude.

1436
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:34,765
Yeah. Thanks, man.

1437
00:58:39,394 --> 00:58:41,396
Call for you, Dude.

1438
00:58:44,691 --> 00:58:45,651
Hello?

1439
00:58:45,692 --> 00:58:48,445
Maude: Jeffrey, you have
not gone to the doctor.

1440
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:51,323
Uh, oh, yeah.
no--no, I haven't yet.

1441
00:58:51,365 --> 00:58:52,324
Uh--

1442
00:58:52,366 --> 00:58:54,826
I'd like to see you
immediately.

1443
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:57,079
Oh?

1444
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:10,217
So you're Lebowski.

1445
00:59:10,259 --> 00:59:11,760
Yeah.

1446
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:16,056
Maude has told me
all about you.

1447
00:59:16,098 --> 00:59:18,058
She'll be back
in a minute. Sit down.

1448
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:19,852
Do you want a drink?

1449
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:22,229
Yeah, sure.
White Russian.

1450
00:59:22,271 --> 00:59:24,273
The bar's over there.

1451
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:31,321
So what do you do,
Lebowski?

1452
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:33,282
Who the fuck are you,
man?

1453
00:59:34,283 --> 00:59:36,118
Just a friend
of Maudie's.

1454
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:38,078
Yeah, the friend
with the cleft asshole?

1455
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,457
What do you do?

1456
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:44,334
Oh, nothing much.

1457
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:45,836
Maude: Hello, Jeffrey.

1458
00:59:45,878 --> 00:59:46,753
Hello.

1459
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:48,130
Yeah, how are you?
Um...

1460
00:59:48,172 --> 00:59:49,047
Listen, Maude,

1461
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:52,092
I got to, uh...

1462
00:59:53,468 --> 00:59:56,346
Tender my resignation
or whatever,

1463
00:59:56,388 --> 00:59:58,724
Because, uh...it
looks like your mother

1464
00:59:58,765 --> 01:00:00,642
really was kidnapped
after all.

1465
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:03,520
She most certainly
was not.

1466
01:00:03,562 --> 01:00:06,440
Hey, man, why
don't you fucking...

1467
01:00:06,481 --> 01:00:07,858
Listen occasionally?

1468
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:08,817
You might
learn something.

1469
01:00:08,859 --> 01:00:10,736
Now, I got--

1470
01:00:10,777 --> 01:00:12,279
Please don't call her
my mother.

1471
01:00:13,197 --> 01:00:14,531
She's most definitely
the perpetrator

1472
01:00:14,573 --> 01:00:16,033
and not the victim.

1473
01:00:16,074 --> 01:00:18,952
I'm telling you, I got
pretty definitive evidence--

1474
01:00:18,994 --> 01:00:19,828
From who?

1475
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:21,330
From the main guy--
Oolie.

1476
01:00:21,371 --> 01:00:22,748
Oolie Coco?

1477
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:24,625
Her co-star in
the beaver picture?

1478
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:27,419
Beaver?
you mean vagina--

1479
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:29,838
I mean,
you know the guy?

1480
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,757
I might have introduced them
for all I know.

1481
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:33,717
Do you remember Oolie?

1482
01:00:33,759 --> 01:00:34,635
Hmm.

1483
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:37,054
He's a musician. Used
to have a group--Autobahn.

1484
01:00:37,095 --> 01:00:38,555
Look in my LP's.

1485
01:00:38,597 --> 01:00:41,433
They released one album
in the late seventies.

1486
01:00:41,475 --> 01:00:44,353
Their music is sort of
a--ugh--technopop.

1487
01:00:44,394 --> 01:00:46,730
So he's pretending to be
the abductor?

1488
01:00:46,772 --> 01:00:47,648
Well, yeah.

1489
01:00:47,689 --> 01:00:50,526
Look, Jeffrey, you don't
really kidnap someone

1490
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:51,527
you're acquainted with.

1491
01:00:51,568 --> 01:00:52,319
The whole idea

1492
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:53,820
is that the hostage can't
be able to identify you

1493
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:55,322
after you've let them go.

1494
01:00:55,364 --> 01:00:56,782
I know that.

1495
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,538
What the fuck
is with this guy?

1496
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:04,039
Who is he?

1497
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:04,957
Knox Harrington.

1498
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:06,375
The video artist.

1499
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:09,253
So Oolie
has the money?

1500
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:10,629
Well...

1501
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:13,048
Uh, no, not exactly.

1502
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:14,049
Uh...

1503
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:16,593
This is a very
complicated case, Maude.

1504
01:01:17,386 --> 01:01:18,345
A lot of ins,
a lot of outs,

1505
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:20,722
a lot of what-have-yous,
and, uh,

1506
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:22,641
a lot of, uh, strands
to keep in my head, man.

1507
01:01:22,683 --> 01:01:24,643
A lot of strands
in old Duder's head.

1508
01:01:24,685 --> 01:01:25,519
Hello?

1509
01:01:25,561 --> 01:01:27,020
If Oolie doesn't have it,
then who does?

1510
01:01:27,062 --> 01:01:29,857
Ha ha ha ha! It's Sandra,
about the Bearnali.

1511
01:01:29,898 --> 01:01:31,358
Uh, look,
I have to take this.

1512
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,235
Do you still have
that doctor's number?

1513
01:01:33,277 --> 01:01:35,153
Oh. No, really. It's
not even bruised anymore.

1514
01:01:35,195 --> 01:01:36,655
Oh, please, Jeffrey,

1515
01:01:36,697 --> 01:01:37,531
I don't want
to be responsible

1516
01:01:37,573 --> 01:01:39,575
For any delayed
after-effects.

1517
01:01:40,993 --> 01:01:41,952
After-effects?

1518
01:01:41,994 --> 01:01:43,996
Maude: See, see.

1519
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:47,791
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1520
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:12,941
Could you slide
your shorts down,

1521
01:02:12,983 --> 01:02:14,651
Mr. Lebowski, please?

1522
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:16,320
Hmm?

1523
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:18,238
No. No, man.
She hit me right here.

1524
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,740
I understand.

1525
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:22,284
Could you slide
your shorts down, please?

1526
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:34,838
# Just got home
from Illinois #

1527
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,257
# Lock the front door,
oh, boy #

1528
01:02:37,299 --> 01:02:40,928
# Got to sit down,
take a rest on the porch #

1529
01:02:40,969 --> 01:02:43,347
# Imagination sets in #

1530
01:02:43,388 --> 01:02:45,724
# Pretty soon I知 singin' #

1531
01:02:45,766 --> 01:02:47,226

# Lookin' out my back door #

1533

# There's a giant

1534
01:02:52,064 --> 01:02:54,441
# A statue

1535
01:02:54,483 --> 01:02:56,818
# Look at all

1536
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,737
# Dancin' on the lawn #

1537
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:00,739
# A dinosaur Victrola #

1538
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:03,534
# Listenin' to Buck Owens #

1539
01:03:03,575 --> 01:03:05,035
# Doo doo doo #

01:03:05,077 --> 01:03:05,953
# Lookin' out my back door #

1541
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:07,246
Ow! Ooh! Ooh!

1542
01:03:07,287 --> 01:03:11,291
# Tambourines and elephants
are playing in the band #

1543
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:16,046
# Wondrous apparition #

# Won't you take a ride

1550
01:03:48,161 --> 01:03:49,621

1553
01:03:53,959 --> 01:03:55,836
# Doo doo doo #

1554
01:03:55,878 --> 01:03:58,964
# Lookin' out my back door #

1555
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:49,139
He lives
in north Hollywood,

1556
01:04:49,181 --> 01:04:51,558
on Radford, near
the in-n-out burger.

1557
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,935
The in-n-out burger's
on Camrose.

1558
01:04:52,976 --> 01:04:54,353
Near
the in-n-out burger.

1559
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:56,230
Those are good burgers,
Walter.

1560
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:57,648
Shut the fuck up,
Donny.

1561
01:04:57,689 --> 01:04:58,649
The kid is in
ninth grade, Dude,

1562
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:01,527
And his father is--
Are you ready for this?

1563
01:05:01,568 --> 01:05:04,029
His father is
Arthur Digby Sellers.

1564
01:05:04,071 --> 01:05:05,948
Who the fuck is that?

1565
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:06,949
Huh?

1566
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,742
Who the fuck is
Arthur Digby Sellers?

1567
01:05:08,784 --> 01:05:11,620
Ever heard of a little show
called branded, Dude?

1568
01:05:11,662 --> 01:05:12,538
Yes, I know--

1569
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:14,540
All but one man died
there at bitter creek?

1570
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:17,417
I know the fucking show,
Walter. So what?

1571
01:05:17,459 --> 01:05:20,128
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers
wrote 156 episodes, Dude.

1572
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:21,129
Huh.

1573
01:05:21,171 --> 01:05:22,548
The bulk
of the series.

1574
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:23,549
Oh.

1575
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:24,925
Not exactly
a lightweight.

1576
01:05:24,967 --> 01:05:25,926
No.

1577
01:05:25,968 --> 01:05:28,345
And yet his son
is a fucking dunce.

1578
01:05:28,387 --> 01:05:29,847
Heh.

1579
01:05:29,888 --> 01:05:32,641
Anyway, we'll go there
after the what-have-you,

1580
01:05:32,683 --> 01:05:34,226
we'll brace the kid,
should be a pushover.

1581
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:35,644
We'll be near
the in-n-out burger.

1582
01:05:35,686 --> 01:05:38,522
Shut the fuck up,
Donny!

1583
01:05:38,564 --> 01:05:40,440
We'll go out there,
we'll brace the kid,

1584
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:42,442
He should be a pushover.

1585
01:05:42,484 --> 01:05:44,319
We'll get that fucking
$1 million back--

1586
01:05:44,361 --> 01:05:46,738
If he hasn't spent it
already.

1587
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,031
A million fucking clams.

1588
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:50,450
And yes, we'll be near
the, uh...

1589
01:05:50,492 --> 01:05:51,952
In-n-out.

1590
01:05:51,994 --> 01:05:52,828
Hey, shh! Shh!

1591
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:53,829
Some burgers,

1592
01:05:53,871 --> 01:05:54,830
some beers,

1593
01:05:54,872 --> 01:05:55,789
a few laughs.

1594
01:05:57,791 --> 01:06:01,170
Our fucking troubles
are over, Dude.

1595
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:14,933
Oh, fuck me, man!

1596
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:18,228
That kid's already spent
all the money, man!

1597
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:19,730
New 'vette?
Hardly, Dude.

1598
01:06:19,771 --> 01:06:24,526
I'd say he still has
960, $970,000 left,

1599
01:06:24,568 --> 01:06:26,445
depending on the options.

1600
01:06:26,486 --> 01:06:27,487
Wait in the car, Donny.

1601
01:06:30,574 --> 01:06:31,450
Woman: Yes?

1602
01:06:31,491 --> 01:06:32,868
Pilar?

1603
01:06:34,369 --> 01:06:35,746
My name
is Walter Sobchak.

1604
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:38,624
This is my associate
Jeffrey Lebowski.

1605
01:06:38,665 --> 01:06:40,918
Um, we came to talk
about little Larry.

1606
01:06:40,959 --> 01:06:42,419
May we come in?

1607
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:43,837
Pilar: Yes, yes.

1608
01:06:43,879 --> 01:06:44,796
Thank you.

1609
01:06:49,259 --> 01:06:50,761
That's him, Dude.

1610
01:06:57,976 --> 01:07:00,354
And a good day to you,
Sir!

1611
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:02,898
Uh, sit down, please.

1612
01:07:07,486 --> 01:07:10,322
Larry, sweetie,
that man is here!

1613
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:11,740
Is he...

1614
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:13,242
Does he still write?

1615
01:07:13,283 --> 01:07:14,618
Oh, no, no.

1616
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,537
He has health problems.

1617
01:07:16,578 --> 01:07:17,579
Uh-huh.

1618
01:07:18,997 --> 01:07:21,333
Uh, sir, I just
want to say, uh...

1619
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:22,835
That we're both,

1620
01:07:22,876 --> 01:07:24,837
on a personal level...

1621
01:07:24,878 --> 01:07:27,756
Really enormous fans.

1622
01:07:27,798 --> 01:07:31,051
Branded, especially
the early episodes,

1623
01:07:31,093 --> 01:07:33,053
was truly a source
of inspiration--

1624
01:07:33,095 --> 01:07:34,346
Pilar:
Sweetie, sit down!

1625
01:07:34,388 --> 01:07:35,347
Uh, this man
is the police.

1626
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:36,348
Oh, no, ma'am,

1627
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:37,724
we didn't want
to give the impression

1628
01:07:37,766 --> 01:07:38,725
that we were police
exactly.

1629
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:40,644
We're hoping
it won't be necessary

1630
01:07:40,686 --> 01:07:41,520
to call the police.

1631
01:07:41,562 --> 01:07:44,439
But that's up
to little Larry here.

1632
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:45,899
Isn't it, Larry?

1633
01:07:56,076 --> 01:07:58,495
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1634
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:01,248
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1635
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:02,124
Look, man--

1636
01:08:02,165 --> 01:08:03,125
Dude, please.

1637
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:05,043
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1638
01:08:05,085 --> 01:08:06,920
Just ask him
about the car, man.

1639
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:07,921
Is this yours, Larry?

1640
01:08:07,963 --> 01:08:09,339
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1641
01:08:09,381 --> 01:08:10,841
Is that your car
out front?

1642
01:08:10,883 --> 01:08:11,717
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1643
01:08:11,758 --> 01:08:13,218
We know it's
his fucking homework!

1644
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,637
Where's the fucking money,
you little brat?

1645
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:17,556
Look, Larry...

1646
01:08:17,598 --> 01:08:18,557
Have you ever heard
of Vietnam?

1647
01:08:18,599 --> 01:08:20,434
You're entering
a world of pain, son.

1648
01:08:20,475 --> 01:08:21,935
we know that this is
your homework.

1649
01:08:21,977 --> 01:08:23,353
We know that you stole
the car.

1650
01:08:23,395 --> 01:08:24,730
And the fucking money!

1651
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:26,231
And the fucking money.

1652
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:27,649
And we know that this
is your homework.

1653
01:08:27,691 --> 01:08:29,026
We're gonna cut
your dick off, Larry.

1654
01:08:29,067 --> 01:08:31,570
You're killing
your father, Larry.

1655
01:08:33,363 --> 01:08:34,740
All right.

1656
01:08:34,781 --> 01:08:36,241
This is pointless.

1657
01:08:36,283 --> 01:08:37,618
Ok?

1658
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:40,579
It's time for plan "b."

1659
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:45,334
You might want to watch out
that front window, Larry.

1660
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:47,336
Son, this is what happens

1661
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:49,796
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass!

1662
01:08:51,298 --> 01:08:52,633
Little language problem
here.

1663
01:08:52,674 --> 01:08:55,928
The little prick's
stonewalling me.

1664
01:08:55,969 --> 01:08:57,846
Walter!

1665
01:08:57,888 --> 01:08:59,765
What--what are you doing,
man?

1666
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:04,186
What are you doing?

1667
01:09:05,062 --> 01:09:06,522
Here you go, Larry.

1668
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:08,857
You see what happens?

1669
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:11,735
You see what happens,
Larry?

1670
01:09:11,777 --> 01:09:13,737
You see what happens?

1671
01:09:13,779 --> 01:09:15,155
This is what happens

1672
01:09:15,197 --> 01:09:17,074
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass, Larry!

1673
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:21,453
This is what happens,
Larry!

1674
01:09:21,495 --> 01:09:23,247
You see what happens,
Larry?

1675
01:09:23,288 --> 01:09:24,748
You see what happens

1676
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:26,124
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

1677
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,543
This is what happens.

1678
01:09:27,584 --> 01:09:29,586
You see what happens,
Larry?

1679
01:09:30,462 --> 01:09:31,421
You see what happens,
Larry?

1680
01:09:31,463 --> 01:09:33,841
Do you see what happens,
Larry,

1681
01:09:33,882 --> 01:09:36,385
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

1682
01:09:37,261 --> 01:09:41,056
This is what happens,
Larry!

1683
01:09:41,098 --> 01:09:42,057
Man: No!

1684
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:43,433
This is what happens,
Larry!

1685
01:09:43,475 --> 01:09:44,434
This is what happens

1686
01:09:44,476 --> 01:09:45,853
when you fuck a stranger--

1687
01:09:45,894 --> 01:09:47,354
What the fuck
are you doing, man?!

1688
01:09:47,396 --> 01:09:48,230
Stop it!

1689
01:09:48,272 --> 01:09:50,524
I just bought
that fucking car last week!

1690
01:09:50,566 --> 01:09:51,525
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1691
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:52,943
I'm gonna
fuckin' kill you!

1692
01:09:52,985 --> 01:09:55,821
I just bought
the fucking car last week!

1693
01:09:55,863 --> 01:09:58,240
I値l kill your
fucking car, man!

1694
01:09:58,282 --> 01:10:00,242
No! No! Hey! Hey!
That's not his--hey!

1695
01:10:00,284 --> 01:10:01,618
God damn it!

1696
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:03,036
No! Oh, no!

1697
01:10:03,078 --> 01:10:04,538
Man: Fuck you!

1698
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:05,956
You like that?

1699
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:07,457
Fuck you!

1700
01:10:07,499 --> 01:10:12,963
I kill your fucking car!

1701
01:10:32,482 --> 01:10:33,817
I accept your apology.

1702
01:10:33,859 --> 01:10:36,737
No. I just--I just

1703
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:39,656
Want to handle it
by myself from now on.

1704
01:10:39,698 --> 01:10:41,533
No, no, no.

1705
01:10:41,575 --> 01:10:44,828
That has nothing
to do with it.

1706
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:46,747
Yes, the car made it home.

1707
01:10:46,788 --> 01:10:49,124
You're calling me at home.

1708
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:50,626
No, Walter,

1709
01:10:50,667 --> 01:10:53,045
it did not look like...

1710
01:10:53,086 --> 01:10:55,422
Larry was about to crack.

1711
01:10:55,464 --> 01:10:58,383
Well,
that's your perception.

1712
01:10:59,259 --> 01:11:02,137
You know, Walter,
you're right.

1713
01:11:02,179 --> 01:11:04,556
There is
an unspoken message here.

1714
01:11:04,598 --> 01:11:05,557
It's fuck you!

1715
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:07,559
Leave me the fuck alone!

1716
01:11:09,394 --> 01:11:12,397
Yeah, I値l be at practice.

1717
01:11:29,081 --> 01:11:30,040
Pin your diapers on,
Lebowski.

1718
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:31,917
Jackie Treehorn
wants to see you.

1719
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:35,337
Jackie Treehorn knows
which Lebowski you are.

1720
01:11:35,379 --> 01:11:37,631
Jackie Treehorn wants to see
the deadbeat Lebowski.

1721
01:11:37,673 --> 01:11:40,259
You're not dealing
with morons here.

1722
01:12:25,262 --> 01:12:26,722
Hello, Dude.

1723
01:12:26,763 --> 01:12:28,140
Thanks for coming.

1724
01:12:28,182 --> 01:12:30,058
I'm Jackie Treehorn.

1725
01:12:31,977 --> 01:12:35,355
This is quite a pad
you got here, man.

1726
01:12:35,397 --> 01:12:37,232
Completely unspoiled.

1727
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:39,234
What's your drink, Dude?

1728
01:12:39,276 --> 01:12:41,153
White Russian.
Thanks.

1729
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:43,322
White Russian.

1730
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:45,449
How's the smut business,
Jackie?

1731
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:47,326
I wouldn't know,
Dude.

1732
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:49,328
I deal in publishing,

1733
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:50,245
entertainment,

1734
01:12:50,287 --> 01:12:52,331
political advocacy.

1735
01:12:52,372 --> 01:12:53,749
Oh. Which one's
Logjamming?

1736
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:55,626
Yes, regrettably,
it's true.

1737
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:58,420
Standards have fallen
in adult entertainment.

1738
01:12:58,462 --> 01:12:59,838
It's video, Dude.

1739
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,341
Now that we're competing
with those amateurs,

1740
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:06,136
We can't afford to invest
in little extras, like story,

1741
01:13:06,178 --> 01:13:08,055
production value,

1742
01:13:08,096 --> 01:13:10,432
feelings.

1743
01:13:10,474 --> 01:13:12,851
You know, people forget

1744
01:13:12,893 --> 01:13:17,231
that the brain is
the biggest erogenous zone.

1745
01:13:17,272 --> 01:13:18,649
On you maybe.

1746
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:20,526
Of course, you have to take
the good with the bad.

1747
01:13:20,567 --> 01:13:23,320
New technology permits us
to do very exciting things

1748
01:13:23,362 --> 01:13:25,739
In interactive
erotic software.

1749
01:13:25,781 --> 01:13:27,241
Wave of the future,
Dude.

1750
01:13:27,282 --> 01:13:30,536
100% electronic.

1751
01:13:30,577 --> 01:13:32,037
Hmm. Well...

1752
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:34,581
I still jerk off
manually.

1753
01:13:35,874 --> 01:13:36,834
Of course you do.

1754
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:38,252
I can see you're anxious

1755
01:13:38,293 --> 01:13:39,753
for me to get to the point.

1756
01:13:39,795 --> 01:13:42,130
Well, here it is, Dude.

1757
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:44,049
Where's Bunny?

1758
01:13:44,091 --> 01:13:45,926
Well, I thought you
might know that, man.

1759
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:47,427
Why would I?

1760
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:48,846
She only ran off

1761
01:13:48,887 --> 01:13:51,139
to get away from that
rather sizable debt to me.

1762
01:13:51,181 --> 01:13:53,517
No. She didn't run off.
She's been, um--

1763
01:13:53,559 --> 01:13:55,435
I've heard that kidnapping
story, so save it.

1764
01:13:55,477 --> 01:13:58,355
I know you're mixed up
in all this, Dude,

1765
01:13:58,397 --> 01:14:01,733
And I don't care what you're
trying to get from the husband.

1766
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:03,151
That's your business.

1767
01:14:03,193 --> 01:14:05,654
All I知 saying is...

1768
01:14:05,696 --> 01:14:07,155
I want mine.

1769
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:08,532
Yeah, right, man.

1770
01:14:08,574 --> 01:14:10,534
I mean, there are
a lot of, um,

1771
01:14:10,576 --> 01:14:14,496
Facets to this, a lot
of interested parties.

1772
01:14:15,372 --> 01:14:16,790
Excuse me.

1773
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:22,379
Yeah?

1774
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,840
Oh, yeah.

1775
01:14:24,882 --> 01:14:25,799
Where's that?

1776
01:14:29,178 --> 01:14:30,596
All right.

1777
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:35,392
Excuse me.

1778
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:02,377
Oh.

1779
01:15:09,468 --> 01:15:10,844
Forgive me.

1780
01:15:10,886 --> 01:15:13,222
No problemo, man.

1781
01:15:13,263 --> 01:15:14,640
So, uh...

1782
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:18,936
If I, uh, can find
your money...

1783
01:15:18,977 --> 01:15:21,855
Uh, what's in it
for The Dude?

1784
01:15:21,897 --> 01:15:23,357
Well, of course,
there's that to discuss.

1785
01:15:23,398 --> 01:15:24,942
Uh, refill?

1786
01:15:24,983 --> 01:15:26,443
Yeah. The pope
shit in the woods?

1787
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:27,819
10% finder's fee.

1788
01:15:27,861 --> 01:15:28,820
That all right?

1789
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:29,738
Mmm. Ok.

1790
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:30,739
Done, Jackie.

1791
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:34,117
Yeah. I dig the way
you do business, man.

1792
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:35,536
Your money
is being held

1793
01:15:35,577 --> 01:15:37,829
By a kid named
Larry Sellers.

1794
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:39,248
He lives
in north Hollywood,

1795
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:40,749
On Radford, uh...

1796
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:43,752
By the
in-n-out burger.

1797
01:15:43,794 --> 01:15:46,630
A fuckin' brat,
but I知 sure your goons

1798
01:15:46,672 --> 01:15:50,425
Can get it off him.
I mean, he's 15.

1799
01:15:50,467 --> 01:15:53,470
Flunking social studies.

1800
01:15:56,765 --> 01:15:59,142
So, if you could just,
uh...

1801
01:15:59,184 --> 01:16:02,938
Write me a check for my
10% of half a million...

1802
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:05,232
5 grand...

1803
01:16:05,274 --> 01:16:06,692
I値l go out and mingle--

1804
01:16:10,571 --> 01:16:13,490
You mix a hell
of a Caucasian, Jackie.

1805
01:16:14,491 --> 01:16:16,827
A 15-year-old kid.

1806
01:16:16,869 --> 01:16:20,622
Is this
some sort of a joke?

1807
01:16:20,664 --> 01:16:22,124
No, no joke.

1808
01:16:22,165 --> 01:16:25,919
No funny stuff, Jackie.
the kid's got it.

1809
01:16:25,961 --> 01:16:27,462
Hi, fellas.

1810
01:16:29,882 --> 01:16:31,884
The kid just wanted
a car.

1811
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:38,348
All The Dude ever wanted
was his rug back.

1812
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:39,892
I'm not greedy.

1813
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:44,146
It would really...

1814
01:16:44,188 --> 01:16:45,689
Tie the room together.

1815
01:16:47,983 --> 01:16:50,819
The stranger:
Darkness washed over The Dude.

1816
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:53,739
Darker than
a black steer's took us

1817
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:56,617
On a moonless prairie night.

1818
01:16:56,658 --> 01:17:00,078
There was no bottom.

1819
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:14,218
# Yeah, yeah #

1820
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:15,636
# Oh, yeah #

1821
01:17:15,677 --> 01:17:19,181
# What condition
 my condition was in #

1822
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:23,852
# I woke up this morning
with the sun down #

1823
01:17:23,894 --> 01:17:26,396
# Shinin' in him #

1824
01:17:28,565 --> 01:17:33,320
# I found my mind
in a brown paper bag #

1825
01:17:33,362 --> 01:17:34,363
# But then #

1826
01:17:36,782 --> 01:17:40,536
# I tripped on a cloud
and fell 8 miles high #

1827
01:17:40,577 --> 01:17:44,540
# I tore my mind
on a jagged sky #

1828
01:17:44,581 --> 01:17:46,917
# I just dropped in #

1829
01:17:46,959 --> 01:17:51,255
# To see what condition
my condition was in #

1830
01:17:51,296 --> 01:17:53,549
# Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah #

1831
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:56,468
# What condition
my condition was in #

1832
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:06,436
# I pushed my soul
in a deep dark hole #

1833
01:18:06,478 --> 01:18:08,981
# And then
I followed it in #

1834
01:18:10,899 --> 01:18:13,735
# I watched myself
crawlin' out #

1835
01:18:13,777 --> 01:18:18,156
# As I was crawlin' in #

1836
01:18:18,198 --> 01:18:19,950
# I got up so tight #

1837
01:18:19,992 --> 01:18:22,327
# I couldn't unwind #

1838
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:24,246
# I saw so much #

1839
01:18:24,288 --> 01:18:26,623
# I broke my mind #

1840
01:18:26,665 --> 01:18:28,542
# I just dropped in #

1841
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:32,588
# To see what condition
my condition was in #

1842
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:43,557
# Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah #

1843
01:18:43,599 --> 01:18:47,060
# What condition
my condition was in #

1844
01:18:52,065 --> 01:18:55,527
# Someone
painted echoes on #

1845
01:18:55,569 --> 01:18:56,445
# In big black letters #

1846
01:18:56,486 --> 01:18:58,363
# On the dead inside #

1847
01:19:00,365 --> 01:19:02,242
# I kept my foot
on the gas #

1848
01:19:02,284 --> 01:19:04,119
# As I left the road #

1849
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:07,456
# Blew out my mind #

1850
01:19:07,497 --> 01:19:11,752
# 8 miles out of Memphis,
and I got no spare #

1851
01:19:11,793 --> 01:19:16,048
# 8 miles straightened up
downtown somewhere #

1852
01:19:16,089 --> 01:19:18,050
# I just dropped in #

1853
01:19:18,091 --> 01:19:22,471
# To see what condition
my condition was in #

1854
01:19:23,889 --> 01:19:26,225
# I said,
I just dropped in #

1855
01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:30,521
# To see what condition
my condition was in #

1856
01:19:30,562 --> 01:19:33,440
# Yeah #

1857
01:19:33,482 --> 01:19:40,489
# Oh, yeah #

1858
01:19:54,169 --> 01:19:55,087
Ah...

1859
01:19:59,883 --> 01:20:01,885
Ah...

1860
01:20:05,597 --> 01:20:08,559
Ah...

1861
01:20:35,294 --> 01:20:39,131
But the charge was true

1862
01:20:39,173 --> 01:20:43,427
and they say
he ran away

1863
01:20:43,468 --> 01:20:44,469
branded!

1864
01:20:57,566 --> 01:21:00,235
Is this your only I.D.?

1865
01:21:00,277 --> 01:21:02,279
I know my rights,
man.

1866
01:21:03,697 --> 01:21:06,533
You don't know shit,
Lebowski.

1867
01:21:06,575 --> 01:21:08,452
I want
a fucking lawyer, man.

1868
01:21:08,493 --> 01:21:10,329
I want...

1869
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:12,789
Bill Kunstler, man.

1870
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:15,626
Or Ron Coobie.

1871
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:17,127
Mr. Treehorn tells us

1872
01:21:17,169 --> 01:21:20,422
that he had to eject you
from his garden party,

1873
01:21:20,464 --> 01:21:23,342
that you were drunk
and abusive.

1874
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:28,555
Mr. Treehorn treats objects
like women, man.

1875
01:21:28,597 --> 01:21:30,933
Mr. Treehorn draws
a lot of water in this town.

1876
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:33,352
You don't draw shit,
Lebowski.

1877
01:21:33,393 --> 01:21:36,730
Now we got a nice quiet
little beach community here,

1878
01:21:36,772 --> 01:21:38,649
and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.

1879
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:41,527
So let me
make something plain.

1880
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:43,445
I don't like you
sucking around,

1881
01:21:43,487 --> 01:21:45,822
bothering our citizens,
Lebowski.

1882
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:48,242
I don't like
your jerk-off name,

1883
01:21:48,283 --> 01:21:50,244
I don't like
your jerk-off face,

1884
01:21:50,285 --> 01:21:51,620
I don't like
your jerk-off behavior,

1885
01:21:51,662 --> 01:21:53,455
And I don't like you...

1886
01:21:53,497 --> 01:21:54,998
Jerk-off.

1887
01:21:57,459 --> 01:22:00,379
Do I make myself clear?

1888
01:22:02,297 --> 01:22:05,592
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.

1889
01:22:06,385 --> 01:22:07,553
Ow!

1890
01:22:07,594 --> 01:22:08,929
Fucking fascist!

1891
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:10,430
Aah!

1892
01:22:10,472 --> 01:22:12,349
Stay out of Malibu,
Lebowski!

1893
01:22:12,391 --> 01:22:13,350
Ow!

1894
01:22:13,392 --> 01:22:16,144
Stay out of Malibu,
deadbeat!

1895
01:22:16,186 --> 01:22:18,522
Keep your ugly fucking
gold-bricking ass

1896
01:22:18,564 --> 01:22:21,358
out of
my beach community.

1897
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:27,531
# I want to sleep with you
in the desert tonight #

1898
01:22:27,573 --> 01:22:32,452
# With a billion stars
all around #

1899
01:22:32,494 --> 01:22:33,829
Jesus...

1900
01:22:33,871 --> 01:22:36,248
Man, could you
change the channel?

1901
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:38,250
Fuck you, man!
if you don't like my music,

1902
01:22:38,292 --> 01:22:39,126
get your own fucking cab!

1903
01:22:39,168 --> 01:22:40,627
I had a really rough--

1904
01:22:40,669 --> 01:22:42,546
I値l pull over
and kiss your ass out.

1905
01:22:42,588 --> 01:22:44,423
Man, come on,
I had a rough night,

1906
01:22:44,464 --> 01:22:47,968
And I hate
the fucking eagles, man.

1907
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:55,434
Out of my fucking cab!

1908
01:22:55,475 --> 01:22:56,351
Out! Get--

1909
01:22:56,393 --> 01:22:57,352
Hey...

1910
01:22:57,394 --> 01:22:58,353
Man!

1911
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:00,397
Man, hey!

1912
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:18,457
# Devil-may-care #

1913
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:21,752
# And I知 the devil
with love to spare #

1914
01:23:21,793 --> 01:23:26,256
# So viva, Las Vegas #

1915
01:23:26,298 --> 01:23:29,676
# Viva, Las Vegas #

1916
01:23:41,063 --> 01:23:42,439
Oh...

1917
01:23:42,481 --> 01:23:43,899
Jesus.

1918
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:03,752
Jeffrey.

1919
01:24:03,794 --> 01:24:06,129
Maude?

1920
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:07,589
Love me.

1921
01:24:08,966 --> 01:24:11,343
Uh, that's my robe.

1922
01:24:11,385 --> 01:24:15,055
Maude: Tell me about
yourself, Jeffrey.

1923
01:24:15,097 --> 01:24:17,349
Well, not much
to tell.

1924
01:24:17,391 --> 01:24:22,229
I, um, I was one
of the authors

1925
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:25,148
of the port Huron
Statement.

1926
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:27,025
The original
Port Huron Statement.

1927
01:24:27,067 --> 01:24:27,943
Uh-huh.

1928
01:24:27,985 --> 01:24:31,989
Not the compromised
second draft.

1929
01:24:33,365 --> 01:24:36,118
Uh, and then I, uh,

1930
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:37,536
you ever hear
of the Seattle 7?

1931
01:24:37,578 --> 01:24:38,537
Mmm.

1932
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:41,456
That was me.

1933
01:24:41,498 --> 01:24:45,752
And, um,
the 6 other guys.

1934
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:49,631
Um, and then
a music business briefly.

1935
01:24:49,673 --> 01:24:50,549
Oh?

1936
01:24:50,591 --> 01:24:52,926
Yeah, a roadie
for Metallica.

1937
01:24:52,968 --> 01:24:53,927
Oh.

1938
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:55,846
Speed of sound tour.

1939
01:24:55,888 --> 01:24:57,723
Mm-hmm.

1940
01:24:57,764 --> 01:25:00,225
Bunch of assholes.

1941
01:25:00,267 --> 01:25:02,019
Uh, and then,
you know,

1942
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:04,938
A little of this,
a little of that.

1943
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:08,233
My career's slowed down
a little lately.

1944
01:25:08,275 --> 01:25:12,154
What do you do
for recreation?

1945
01:25:12,196 --> 01:25:17,451
Oh, the usual.
Bowl, drive around.

1946
01:25:17,492 --> 01:25:20,495
The occasional
acid flashback.

1947
01:25:26,084 --> 01:25:28,337
What happened
to your house?

1948
01:25:28,378 --> 01:25:30,339
Oh, Jackie Treehorn
trashed the place.

1949
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:33,133
He thought I had
your father's money.

1950
01:25:33,175 --> 01:25:36,136
He got me out of the way
while he looked for it.

1951
01:25:36,178 --> 01:25:37,137
Cocktail?

1952
01:25:37,179 --> 01:25:38,555
No, thanks.

1953
01:25:38,597 --> 01:25:40,057
It's not my
father's money.

1954
01:25:40,098 --> 01:25:41,934
It's the
Foundation's.

1955
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:43,852
Why did he think
you have it?

1956
01:25:43,894 --> 01:25:45,354
And who does?

1957
01:25:45,395 --> 01:25:48,148
Oh, Larry Sellers,
this high school kid.

1958
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:49,525
Real fucking brat.

1959
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:52,945
You know, this is a very
complicated case, Maude.

1960
01:25:52,986 --> 01:25:55,739
Lotta ins, lotta outs.

1961
01:25:55,781 --> 01:25:56,657
You know, fortunately,

1962
01:25:56,698 --> 01:25:59,034
I'm adhering to
a pretty strict, uh,

1963
01:25:59,076 --> 01:26:01,453
drug regiment to keep
my mind, you know,

1964
01:26:01,495 --> 01:26:03,455
Uh, limber, you know.

1965
01:26:03,497 --> 01:26:05,958
Very fucking close
to your father's money.

1966
01:26:05,999 --> 01:26:08,335
I keep telling you it's
the Foundation's money.

1967
01:26:08,377 --> 01:26:09,795
Father doesn't have any.

1968
01:26:11,672 --> 01:26:13,549
What are you talking about?
he's fucking loaded.

1969
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:16,426
No, no, the wealth
was all mother's.

1970
01:26:16,468 --> 01:26:18,428
No, he runs stuff, uh--

1971
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:20,848
We did let him run one
of the companies briefly,

1972
01:26:20,889 --> 01:26:22,140
But he didn't do
very well at it.

1973
01:26:22,182 --> 01:26:23,642
No, he's, you know.

1974
01:26:23,684 --> 01:26:25,018
No, he helps administer
the charities now,

1975
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:28,438
and I give him
a reasonable allowance.

1976
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:29,857
He has no money
of his own.

1977
01:26:29,898 --> 01:26:31,733
I know how he likes
to present himself.

1978
01:26:31,775 --> 01:26:33,735
Father's weakness
is vanity.

1979
01:26:33,777 --> 01:26:34,653
Hence, the slut.

1980
01:26:34,695 --> 01:26:39,950
Uh, do you think he, uh--

1981
01:26:39,992 --> 01:26:41,326
What is that, yoga?

1982
01:26:41,368 --> 01:26:43,787
It increases the chances
of conception.

1983
01:26:46,665 --> 01:26:47,624
Increases?

1984
01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:48,917
Well, yes.

1985
01:26:48,959 --> 01:26:50,419
What did you think
this was all about?

1986
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:51,336
Fun and games?

1987
01:26:51,378 --> 01:26:54,256
I want a child.

1988
01:26:54,298 --> 01:26:56,633
Ok, yeah, ok,
but let me--

1989
01:26:56,675 --> 01:26:58,635
Ahem, let me explain
something about The Dude.

1990
01:26:58,677 --> 01:27:00,554
Uh, look, Jeffrey,

1991
01:27:00,596 --> 01:27:02,055
I don't want
a partner.

1992
01:27:02,097 --> 01:27:04,057
In fact, I don't
want the father

1993
01:27:04,099 --> 01:27:05,934
to be someone
I have to see socially

1994
01:27:05,976 --> 01:27:07,352
or who'll have
any interest

1995
01:27:07,394 --> 01:27:08,854
in raising
the child himself.

1996
01:27:08,896 --> 01:27:12,524
Oh, so that doctor--

1997
01:27:12,566 --> 01:27:17,738
Exactly. Now, what
happened to your face?

1998
01:27:17,779 --> 01:27:19,656
Did Jackie Treehorn
Do that as well?

1999
01:27:19,698 --> 01:27:23,535
No, uh, it was the chief
of police of Malibu.

2000
01:27:23,577 --> 01:27:25,037
A real reactionary.

2001
01:27:25,078 --> 01:27:28,957
So, your father...

2002
01:27:28,999 --> 01:27:30,834
Oh, yeah, I get it.
Yeah, yeah.

2003
01:27:30,876 --> 01:27:31,835
What?

2004
01:27:31,877 --> 01:27:34,254
Oh, man, my thinking
about this case

2005
01:27:34,296 --> 01:27:38,592
had become very uptight.
Yeah, your father.

2006
01:27:39,885 --> 01:27:42,471
Jeffrey, what are
you talking about?

2007
01:27:44,264 --> 01:27:45,140
Jeffrey!

2008
01:27:45,182 --> 01:27:46,642
Walter, if you're there,

2009
01:27:46,683 --> 01:27:50,437
pick up the fucking phone,
man, come on, Walter.

2010
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:52,356
Pick it up, man,
this is an emergency.

2011
01:27:52,397 --> 01:27:53,357
Come on, enough--Dude?

2012
01:27:53,398 --> 01:27:55,734
Yeah, listen, Walter,
I'm at my place.

2013
01:27:55,776 --> 01:27:57,152
I need you to come
pick me up.

2014
01:27:57,194 --> 01:27:58,654
I can't drive, Dude,
It's Erev Shabbos.

2015
01:27:58,695 --> 01:28:02,032
What?
Erev Shabbos.

2016
01:28:02,074 --> 01:28:04,451
I can't drive.
Man!

2017
01:28:04,493 --> 01:28:05,327
I'm not even supposed
to pick up the phone

2018
01:28:05,369 --> 01:28:06,828
unless it's
an emergency.

2019
01:28:06,870 --> 01:28:09,122
This is
a fucking emergency.

2020
01:28:09,164 --> 01:28:11,542
I understand. That's why
I picked up the phone.

2021
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:12,918
Walter, you fuck,

2022
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,837
we gotta go
to Pasadena, man.

2023
01:28:14,878 --> 01:28:17,589
Come pick me up or I知 off
the fucking bowling team.

2024
01:28:32,396 --> 01:28:35,065
Get out of that
fucking car, man.

2025
01:28:35,566 --> 01:28:38,026
Get out of that
fucking car!

2026
01:28:38,068 --> 01:28:40,988
Get the fuck out
of the car, man.

2027
01:28:42,364 --> 01:28:44,324
Get out of
the fucking--

2028
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:45,742
Who the fuck
are you, man?

2029
01:28:45,784 --> 01:28:48,620
Easy, man.
Relax, man.

2030
01:28:48,662 --> 01:28:50,539
No physical harm
intended.

2031
01:28:50,581 --> 01:28:51,540
Who the fuck
are you?

2032
01:28:51,582 --> 01:28:52,958
Why are you
following me around?

2033
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,418
Come on, fuckhead.

2034
01:28:54,459 --> 01:28:56,837
Relax, man.
I'm a brother Seamus.

2035
01:28:56,879 --> 01:28:58,297
Brother Seamus?

2036
01:29:00,299 --> 01:29:01,633
Like an Irish monk?

2037
01:29:01,675 --> 01:29:03,427
What the fuck are you
talking about?

2038
01:29:03,468 --> 01:29:04,928
My name is Da Fino.

2039
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:07,848
I'm a private snoop,
like you, man.

2040
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:09,641
What?

2041
01:29:09,683 --> 01:29:10,517
A dick, man.

2042
01:29:10,559 --> 01:29:14,021
And let me tell you
something. I dig your work.

2043
01:29:14,062 --> 01:29:15,522
Playing one side
against the other.

2044
01:29:15,564 --> 01:29:17,941
In bed with everybody.
Fabulous stuff, man.

2045
01:29:17,983 --> 01:29:19,818
I'm not--fuck it, man.

2046
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:22,237
Just stay away from
my fucking lady friend.

2047
01:29:22,279 --> 01:29:24,656
Hey, hey, I知 not messing
with your special lady.

2048
01:29:24,698 --> 01:29:26,033
She's not
my special lady.

2049
01:29:26,074 --> 01:29:27,034
She's my fucking
lady friend.

2050
01:29:27,075 --> 01:29:28,952
I'm just helping
her conceive, man.

2051
01:29:28,994 --> 01:29:29,828
Hey, man, I知 not--

2052
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:30,746
Who are you
working for?

2053
01:29:30,787 --> 01:29:32,247
Lebowski?

2054
01:29:32,289 --> 01:29:34,291
Jackie Treehorn?

2055
01:29:35,167 --> 01:29:36,543
The Knutsens.

2056
01:29:36,585 --> 01:29:40,839
The--who the fuck
are the Knutsens?

2057
01:29:40,881 --> 01:29:44,676
The Knutsen's. It's
a wandering daughter job.

2058
01:29:45,677 --> 01:29:48,055
Bunny Lebowski, man.

2059
01:29:48,096 --> 01:29:50,849
Her real name
is Fawn Knutsen.

2060
01:29:50,891 --> 01:29:53,352
Her parents want her back.

2061
01:29:53,393 --> 01:29:55,646
Jesus fucking Christ.

2062
01:29:55,687 --> 01:29:58,440
Crazy, huh? Ran away
about a year ago.

2063
01:29:58,482 --> 01:30:00,817
The Knutsens told me
I should show her this

2064
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:01,818
when I found her.

2065
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:03,320
It's the family farm.

2066
01:30:03,362 --> 01:30:05,739
It's outside of
Moorhead, Minnesota.

2067
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:07,157
They think it'll
make her homesick.

2068
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:09,034
Oh, boy.
How are you gonna

2069
01:30:09,076 --> 01:30:10,035
keep 'em
down on the farm

2070
01:30:10,077 --> 01:30:13,038
once they've seen
Karl Hungus?

2071
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,456
She's been
kidnapped, Da Fino.

2072
01:30:14,498 --> 01:30:15,457
Oh, man.

2073
01:30:15,499 --> 01:30:16,333
Oh, I don't know.
maybe not,

2074
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:18,335
But she's definitely
not around.

2075
01:30:18,377 --> 01:30:22,381
Hey, maybe you and me
could pool our resources.

2076
01:30:22,589 --> 01:30:26,343
Trade information.
Professional courtesy.

2077
01:30:26,385 --> 01:30:27,845
Compeers, you know
what I mean?

2078
01:30:27,886 --> 01:30:30,222
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Fuck off, Da Fino.

2079
01:30:30,264 --> 01:30:32,140
And stay away
from my special--

2080
01:30:32,182 --> 01:30:35,686
From my fucking
lady friend, man.

2081
01:30:37,479 --> 01:30:39,898
Ze lingonberry
pancakes.

2082
01:30:43,777 --> 01:30:45,696
Lingonberry pancakes.

2083
01:30:48,991 --> 01:30:51,869
Sree pigs in blanket.

2084
01:30:54,162 --> 01:30:55,163
Dieter: Huh?

2085
01:30:56,582 --> 01:30:58,584
She has lingonberry
pancakes.

2086
01:31:06,675 --> 01:31:09,136
I mean we totally
fucked it up, man.

2087
01:31:09,178 --> 01:31:10,053
We fucked up his payoff,

2088
01:31:10,095 --> 01:31:12,431
we got the kidnappers
all pissed off,

2089
01:31:12,472 --> 01:31:14,349
And Lebowski, you know,
he yelled at me a lot,

2090
01:31:14,391 --> 01:31:16,226
But he didn't
do anything, huh?

2091
01:31:16,268 --> 01:31:18,145
Well, sometimes
it's a cathartic--

2092
01:31:18,187 --> 01:31:21,023
No, no, I知 saying if
he knows I知 a fuck-up,

2093
01:31:21,064 --> 01:31:21,940
why does he
leave me in charge

2094
01:31:21,982 --> 01:31:23,442
Of getting his wife back?

2095
01:31:23,483 --> 01:31:26,737
Because he doesn't fucking
want her back, man.

2096
01:31:26,778 --> 01:31:28,739
He's had enough.
He no longer digs her.

2097
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:30,157
It's all a show.

2098
01:31:30,199 --> 01:31:32,534
Ok, but then, why
doesn't he give a shit

2099
01:31:32,576 --> 01:31:34,036
About his million bucks?

2100
01:31:34,077 --> 01:31:36,830
I mean, he knows we never
handed off his briefcase,

2101
01:31:36,872 --> 01:31:39,333
but he never asked
for it back.

2102
01:31:39,374 --> 01:31:42,628
The million bucks was
never in the briefcase.

2103
01:31:42,669 --> 01:31:45,756
The briefcase was
fucking empty, man.

2104
01:31:45,797 --> 01:31:48,634
The asshole was hoping
that they would kill her.

2105
01:31:48,675 --> 01:31:51,053
You threw out a ringer
for a ringer.

2106
01:31:51,094 --> 01:31:52,429
Ok, but how does
this all add up

2107
01:31:52,471 --> 01:31:54,431
To an emergency?
Huh?

2108
01:31:54,473 --> 01:31:57,142
I'm saying I see what
you're getting at, Dude,

2109
01:31:57,184 --> 01:31:58,644
He kept the money.

2110
01:31:58,685 --> 01:32:00,020
My point is, ahem,

2111
01:32:00,062 --> 01:32:02,439
here we are,
it's Shabbos,

2112
01:32:02,481 --> 01:32:04,441
the Sabbath, which
I'm allowed to break

2113
01:32:04,483 --> 01:32:07,236
only if it's a matter
of life or death.

2114
01:32:07,277 --> 01:32:08,737
Will you come off it,
Walter?

2115
01:32:08,779 --> 01:32:10,030
You're not even
fucking Jewish, man.

2116
01:32:10,072 --> 01:32:12,449
What the fuck are
you talking about?

2117
01:32:12,491 --> 01:32:13,951
You're fucking
Polish-catholic.

2118
01:32:13,992 --> 01:32:15,452
What the fuck are
you talking about?

2119
01:32:15,494 --> 01:32:16,954
I converted when
I married Cynthia.

2120
01:32:16,995 --> 01:32:18,330
Come on, Dude.
Yeah, yeah.

2121
01:32:18,372 --> 01:32:19,831
You know this.

2122
01:32:19,873 --> 01:32:21,750
And 5 fucking years ago,
you were divorced.

2123
01:32:21,792 --> 01:32:23,126
So what are saying?
When you get divorced,

2124
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,628
You turn in
your library card?

2125
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:27,047
You get a new license?
You stop being Jewish?

2126
01:32:27,089 --> 01:32:28,423
This is
the driveway, huh?

2127
01:32:28,465 --> 01:32:29,925
I'm Jewish as
fucking Tevye.

2128
01:32:29,967 --> 01:32:32,344
Man, you know,
it's all a part

2129
01:32:32,386 --> 01:32:34,847
of your sick
Cynthia thing.

2130
01:32:34,888 --> 01:32:36,640
Man, taking care
of her fucking dog.

2131
01:32:36,682 --> 01:32:38,517
Going to her
fucking synagogue.

2132
01:32:38,559 --> 01:32:40,435
You're living in
the fucking past.

2133
01:32:40,477 --> 01:32:41,937
3,000 years of
beautiful tradition

2134
01:32:41,979 --> 01:32:43,856
from Moses
to Sandy Koufax,

2135
01:32:43,897 --> 01:32:44,857
you're goddamn right

2136
01:32:44,898 --> 01:32:46,733
I'm living in
the fucking past!

2137
01:32:46,775 --> 01:32:49,027
I--Jesus.

2138
01:32:49,069 --> 01:32:52,531
What the hell
happened?

2139
01:32:52,573 --> 01:33:00,873
# Viva Las Vegas #

2140
01:33:08,589 --> 01:33:10,424
Ah!

2141
01:33:10,465 --> 01:33:11,925
Where was she, man?

2142
01:33:11,967 --> 01:33:13,343
Visiting friends of hers
in palm springs.

2143
01:33:13,385 --> 01:33:14,845
She just picked up
and left.

2144
01:33:14,887 --> 01:33:16,221
Never bothered
to tell us.

2145
01:33:16,263 --> 01:33:18,640
Well, I guess the fucking
nihilist knew where she was.

2146
01:33:18,682 --> 01:33:21,018
Jesus, Dude, she never
even kidnapped herself.

2147
01:33:21,059 --> 01:33:22,519
Who is this gentleman,
Dude?

2148
01:33:22,561 --> 01:33:24,438
Who am I? I'm
a fucking veteran.

2149
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:26,356
He shouldn't go
in there, Dude.

2150
01:33:26,398 --> 01:33:27,774
He's very angry.

2151
01:33:30,277 --> 01:33:31,028
Hello, man.

2152
01:33:31,069 --> 01:33:35,449
So, she's back,
no thanks to you.

2153
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:37,326
Where's the fucking
money, Lebowski?

2154
01:33:37,367 --> 01:33:39,244
A million bucks
from fucking needy

2155
01:33:39,286 --> 01:33:40,746
Little urban
achievers!

2156
01:33:40,787 --> 01:33:42,122
You are scum, man!

2157
01:33:42,164 --> 01:33:43,540
Who the hell is he?

2158
01:33:43,582 --> 01:33:44,541
Who am I? Who am I?

2159
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:45,542
I'm the guy
that's gonna kick

2160
01:33:45,584 --> 01:33:47,419
Your phony goldbricking
ass! That's who I am.

2161
01:33:47,461 --> 01:33:49,338
Man, we know the briefcase
was fucking empty.

2162
01:33:49,379 --> 01:33:51,256
We know you kept the million
bucks for yourself.

2163
01:33:51,298 --> 01:33:52,758
You have your story,
I have mine.

2164
01:33:52,799 --> 01:33:55,135
I say I entrusted
the money to you,

2165
01:33:55,177 --> 01:33:56,053
And you stole it.

2166
01:33:56,094 --> 01:33:57,930
As if we would ever
dream of taking

2167
01:33:57,971 --> 01:33:59,348
your bullshit
money!

2168
01:33:59,389 --> 01:34:01,725
You thought that Bunny
had been kidnapped,

2169
01:34:01,767 --> 01:34:03,227
and you were
fucking glad, man.

2170
01:34:03,268 --> 01:34:05,229
You could use it as an excuse
to make some money disappear.

2171
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:07,147
All you needed was a sap
to pin it on.

2172
01:34:07,189 --> 01:34:11,443
You just met me.
You--human paraquat!

2173
01:34:11,485 --> 01:34:13,737
You figured, oh,
here's a loser, you know.

2174
01:34:13,779 --> 01:34:16,156
A deadbeat.
somebody the square community

2175
01:34:16,198 --> 01:34:17,157
Won't give a shit about.

2176
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:19,284
Well, aren't you?

2177
01:34:20,077 --> 01:34:22,955
Well, yeah, but--

2178
01:34:22,996 --> 01:34:24,248
Get out, both of you.

2179
01:34:24,289 --> 01:34:25,249
Look at that
fucking phony, Dude.

2180
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:27,125
Pretending to be a
fucking millionaire.

2181
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:29,545
Out of this house now,
you bums!

2182
01:34:29,586 --> 01:34:31,046
Let me tell you
something else.

2183
01:34:31,088 --> 01:34:33,423
I've seen a lot of
spinals, Dude,

2184
01:34:33,465 --> 01:34:35,342
And this guy's
a fake.

2185
01:34:35,384 --> 01:34:36,718
A fucking
goldbricker.

2186
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:38,220
Stay away from me,
mister!

2187
01:34:38,262 --> 01:34:40,138
This guy
fucking walks.

2188
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:41,223
I've never been
more certain

2189
01:34:41,265 --> 01:34:42,641
of anything
in my life.

2190
01:34:42,683 --> 01:34:43,517
You stay away from me!

2191
01:34:43,559 --> 01:34:46,019
Walter, for Christ痴 sake,
man, he's a cripple.

2192
01:34:46,061 --> 01:34:47,437
Come on, come on.

2193
01:34:47,479 --> 01:34:48,438
Get away from me!

2194
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,357
Aah!

2195
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:51,233
Put him down, man!

2196
01:34:51,275 --> 01:34:52,651
Yeah, I値l put
him down, Dude!

2197
01:34:52,693 --> 01:34:57,781
Rauss! Achtung, baby!

2198
01:35:11,461 --> 01:35:13,881
Come on, man, help me
put him back in his chair.

2199
01:35:32,983 --> 01:35:35,319
Sure, you'll see
some tank battles.

2200
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,237
But fighting in desert
is very different

2201
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:39,656
from fighting
in canopy jungle.

2202
01:35:39,698 --> 01:35:41,617
I mean 'nam was
a foot soldier's war.

2203
01:35:41,658 --> 01:35:44,828
Whereas, this thing
should, uh, you know,

2204
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:46,330
should be
a piece of cake.

2205
01:35:46,371 --> 01:35:47,748
I mean, I had
an M16, Jacko.

2206
01:35:47,789 --> 01:35:49,625
Not an Abrams
fucking tank.

2207
01:35:49,666 --> 01:35:52,127
Me and Charlie,
eyeball to eyeball.

2208
01:35:52,169 --> 01:35:53,045
Yeah.

2209
01:35:53,086 --> 01:35:55,547
That's fuckin' combat.

2210
01:35:55,589 --> 01:35:57,925
The man in the
black pajamas, Dude.

2211
01:35:57,966 --> 01:35:59,843
Worthy fuckin'
adversary.

2212
01:35:59,885 --> 01:36:00,844
Who's in
pajamas, Walter?

2213
01:36:00,886 --> 01:36:03,222
Shut the fuck up,
Donny.

2214
01:36:03,263 --> 01:36:05,641
Whereas, what we
have here...

2215
01:36:05,682 --> 01:36:07,518
Lots of fig-eaters wearing
towels on their heads,

2216
01:36:07,559 --> 01:36:09,520
trying to find reverse
on a soviet tank.

2217
01:36:09,561 --> 01:36:11,355
This--this is not
a worthy--

2218
01:36:11,396 --> 01:36:12,356
Hey!

2219
01:36:12,397 --> 01:36:14,650
What's this
day of rest shit?

2220
01:36:14,691 --> 01:36:16,527
What's this bullshit!

2221
01:36:16,568 --> 01:36:17,945
I don't fuckin' care!

2222
01:36:17,986 --> 01:36:19,446
It don't matter
to Jesus.

2223
01:36:19,488 --> 01:36:20,948
But you not
fooling me, man.

2224
01:36:20,989 --> 01:36:23,325
You might fool the fucks
in the league office,

2225
01:36:23,367 --> 01:36:25,744
but you don't
fool Jesus.

2226
01:36:25,786 --> 01:36:28,622
It's bush league
psyche-out stuff.

2227
01:36:28,664 --> 01:36:31,041
Laughable, man. Ha ha!

2228
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:34,920
I would have fucked you
in the ass Saturday.

2229
01:36:34,962 --> 01:36:38,131
I値l fuck you in the ass
Next Wednesday instead.

2230
01:36:38,173 --> 01:36:41,677
Whoo! You got a date
Wednesday, baby.

2231
01:36:45,889 --> 01:36:47,724
He's cracking.

2232
01:36:47,766 --> 01:36:48,725
The whole concept of Asia.

2233
01:36:48,767 --> 01:36:51,144
I mean, many learned men
have disputed this,

2234
01:36:51,186 --> 01:36:56,483
but in the 14th century.
the rabahm, he--

2235
01:37:03,866 --> 01:37:05,617
Well, they
finally did it.

2236
01:37:05,659 --> 01:37:08,120
They killed
my fucking car.

2237
01:37:08,161 --> 01:37:11,456
We want some money,
Lebowski.

2238
01:37:11,498 --> 01:37:13,834
Ja, otherwise,
we kill the girl.

2239
01:37:13,876 --> 01:37:15,752
Ja, it seems
you have forgotten

2240
01:37:15,794 --> 01:37:17,337
Our little deal,
Lebowski.

2241
01:37:17,379 --> 01:37:20,257
You don't have the
fucking girl, dipshit.

2242
01:37:20,299 --> 01:37:22,634
We know you never did.

2243
01:37:22,676 --> 01:37:24,052
Are these the Nazis,
Walter?

2244
01:37:24,094 --> 01:37:25,554
No, Donny, these men
are nihilists.

2245
01:37:25,596 --> 01:37:26,972
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

2246
01:37:28,891 --> 01:37:31,727
Vee don't care. Vee
still want the money,

2247
01:37:31,768 --> 01:37:33,937
Lebowski, or
we'll fuck you up.

2248
01:37:33,979 --> 01:37:36,857
Fuck you.
Fuck the 3 of yous.

2249
01:37:36,899 --> 01:37:40,235
No, without a hostage,
there is no ransom.

2250
01:37:40,277 --> 01:37:41,653
That's what ransom is.

2251
01:37:41,695 --> 01:37:43,655
Those are the fucking rules.

2252
01:37:43,697 --> 01:37:45,657
His girlfriend
gave up her toe.

2253
01:37:45,699 --> 01:37:48,035
She zought we'd be
getting $1 million.

2254
01:37:48,076 --> 01:37:49,453
It's not fair.

2255
01:37:49,494 --> 01:37:52,831
Fair? Who's the fucking
nihilist around here?

2256
01:37:52,873 --> 01:37:54,249
You bunch of
fucking crybabies.

2257
01:37:54,291 --> 01:37:56,627
Cool it, Walter.
Hey, look, pal,

2258
01:37:56,668 --> 01:37:58,629
There never was
any money.

2259
01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:00,422
The big Lebowski gave
me an empty briefcase,

2260
01:38:00,464 --> 01:38:02,841
So take it up
with him, man.

2261
01:38:02,883 --> 01:38:05,219
Yeah, and I would like
my undies back.

2262
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:06,220
Are these guys gonna
hurt us, Walter?

2263
01:38:06,261 --> 01:38:08,639
No, Donny, these
men are cowards.

2264
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:11,934
Ok, so we take ze
money you haf on you

2265
01:38:11,975 --> 01:38:13,894
And we calls it
even.

2266
01:38:14,895 --> 01:38:15,854
Fuck you.

2267
01:38:15,896 --> 01:38:17,231
Hey, no, come on,
Walter, come on.

2268
01:38:17,272 --> 01:38:19,149
We're ending this
thing cheap, man.

2269
01:38:19,191 --> 01:38:20,150
No, what's mine is mine.

2270
01:38:20,192 --> 01:38:21,151
Oh, come on, Walter.

2271
01:38:21,193 --> 01:38:22,528
Dieter:
No funny stuff.

2272
01:38:22,569 --> 01:38:25,447
All right,
all right, I got,

2273
01:38:25,489 --> 01:38:28,242
Uh, 4 bucks,
almost 5.

2274
01:38:28,283 --> 01:38:29,117
I got $18.

2275
01:38:29,159 --> 01:38:31,119
Walter: What's
mine is mine.

2276
01:38:31,161 --> 01:38:34,039
We fuck you up, man.
We takes the money.

2277
01:38:34,081 --> 01:38:35,582
Come and get it.

2278
01:38:36,875 --> 01:38:39,253
Dieter: We fuck you up.

2279
01:38:39,294 --> 01:38:41,255
Show me what
you got, nihilist.

2280
01:38:41,296 --> 01:38:42,631
I fuck you.

2281
01:38:42,673 --> 01:38:43,632
Walter, come on,
he's got a sword.

2282
01:38:43,674 --> 01:38:46,051
Fucking dipshit with
a 9-toed woman.

2283
01:38:46,093 --> 01:38:47,427
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

2284
01:38:47,469 --> 01:38:50,472
I fuck you up!

2285
01:38:56,186 --> 01:38:57,020
Take it easy, man.

2286
01:38:57,062 --> 01:38:58,480
Here's the $4.00.

2287
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,280
I got a fucking ball, man.

2288
01:39:07,197 --> 01:39:09,074
Aah!

2289
01:39:11,577 --> 01:39:12,953
Anti-semite!

2290
01:39:12,995 --> 01:39:14,830
I fuck you in ze ass.

2291
01:39:14,872 --> 01:39:16,248
I fuck you
in ze ass.

2292
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:21,795
I fuck you!
I fuck you!

2293
01:39:27,259 --> 01:39:29,178
We got a man down, Dude.

2294
01:39:32,598 --> 01:39:34,558
God, they shot him,
man.

2295
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:35,434
No, Dude.

2296
01:39:35,475 --> 01:39:36,435
They shot Donny?

2297
01:39:36,476 --> 01:39:37,352
There weren't
any shots fired.

2298
01:39:37,394 --> 01:39:39,354
Huh?
It's a heart attack.

2299
01:39:39,396 --> 01:39:41,732
Call the medics, Dude.

2300
01:39:41,773 --> 01:39:44,651
I'd go myself, but I知
pumping blood. Might pass out.

2301
01:39:44,693 --> 01:39:48,322
Rest easy, good buddy,
you're doing fine.

2302
01:39:48,363 --> 01:39:50,365
We got help
choppering in.

2303
01:40:16,683 --> 01:40:19,520
Hello, gentlemen.
You are the bereaved?

2304
01:40:19,561 --> 01:40:20,938
Yeah, man.

2305
01:40:20,979 --> 01:40:23,357
Francis Donnelly.
Pleased to meet you.

2306
01:40:23,398 --> 01:40:24,858
Jeff Lebowski.

2307
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:26,235
Walter Sobchak.

2308
01:40:26,276 --> 01:40:29,154
The Dude, actually,
is, uh--

2309
01:40:29,196 --> 01:40:30,155
Excuse me?

2310
01:40:30,197 --> 01:40:31,532
Oh, nothing.

2311
01:40:31,573 --> 01:40:37,329
Yes, I understand you're
taking away the remains.

2312
01:40:37,371 --> 01:40:39,248
Yeah.

2313
01:40:39,289 --> 01:40:42,042
We have the urn.

2314
01:40:42,084 --> 01:40:45,087
I assume this is
credit card.

2315
01:40:45,963 --> 01:40:46,880
Yeah.

2316
01:40:57,099 --> 01:40:57,975
Walter: Ahem.

2317
01:41:00,894 --> 01:41:01,728
What's this?

2318
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:04,648
That's for the urn.

2319
01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:06,942
Don't need it. We're
Scattering the ashes.

2320
01:41:06,984 --> 01:41:10,028
Yes, so we
Were informed.

2321
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:10,946
However, we must,
Of course,

2322
01:41:10,988 --> 01:41:14,867
Transmit the remains
To you in a receptacle.

2323
01:41:16,285 --> 01:41:18,245
This is $180.

2324
01:41:18,287 --> 01:41:22,040
It is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

2325
01:41:22,082 --> 01:41:24,418
Can we just, uh--$180?

2326
01:41:24,459 --> 01:41:26,336
They range up to 3,000.

2327
01:41:26,378 --> 01:41:28,338
Uh, we're, uh, ahem!

2328
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:30,257
Can't we just
rent it from you?

2329
01:41:30,299 --> 01:41:33,135
Sir, this is a mortuary,
not a rental house.

2330
01:41:33,177 --> 01:41:34,845
We're scattering
the fucking ashes!

2331
01:41:34,887 --> 01:41:36,346
Look, just because
we're bereaved,

2332
01:41:36,388 --> 01:41:37,347
Doesn't
make us saps!

2333
01:41:37,389 --> 01:41:40,225
Sir, please,
lower your voices.

2334
01:41:40,267 --> 01:41:41,643
Man, don't you have,
you know,

2335
01:41:41,685 --> 01:41:45,522
Something else we could
put him in, you know?

2336
01:41:45,564 --> 01:41:48,442
That is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

2337
01:41:48,483 --> 01:41:49,484
God damn it!

2338
01:41:52,279 --> 01:41:54,281
Is there a Ralph痴
around here?

2339
01:42:19,681 --> 01:42:21,058
Donny was
a good bowler

2340
01:42:21,099 --> 01:42:23,435
And a good man.

2341
01:42:23,477 --> 01:42:25,354
He was one of us.

2342
01:42:25,395 --> 01:42:29,024
He was a man who loved
the outdoors and bowling.

2343
01:42:29,066 --> 01:42:31,026
And as a surfer,
he explored the beaches

2344
01:42:31,068 --> 01:42:32,945
of Southern California,

2345
01:42:32,986 --> 01:42:35,948
from La Jolla
to Leo Carrillo

2346
01:42:35,989 --> 01:42:38,825
and up to Pismo.

2347
01:42:38,867 --> 01:42:43,622
He died--he died as so
many men of his generation,

2348
01:42:43,664 --> 01:42:45,040
Before his time.

2349
01:42:45,082 --> 01:42:48,418
In your wisdom, Lord,
you took him.

2350
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:51,839
As you took so many bright,
flowering young men

2351
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:54,132
at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc,

2352
01:42:54,174 --> 01:42:57,427
and Hill 364.

2353
01:42:57,469 --> 01:42:59,847
These young men
gave their lives.

2354
01:42:59,888 --> 01:43:03,725
So did Donny.

2355
01:43:03,767 --> 01:43:05,686
Donny who loved bowling.

2356
01:43:08,564 --> 01:43:14,319
And so, Theodore
Donald Karabatsos,

2357
01:43:14,361 --> 01:43:17,155
in accordance with
what we think

2358
01:43:17,197 --> 01:43:20,534
your dying wishes
might well have been,

2359
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:24,329
We commit your final
mortal remains

2360
01:43:24,371 --> 01:43:28,125
To the bosom
of the pacific ocean,

2361
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:30,169
which you loved so well.

2362
01:43:32,087 --> 01:43:34,089
Good night, sweet prince.

2363
01:43:47,895 --> 01:43:49,771
Shit.

2364
01:43:51,773 --> 01:43:53,192
Oh, shit, Dude,
I'm sorry.

2365
01:43:55,569 --> 01:43:56,528
God damn wind.

2366
01:43:56,570 --> 01:43:58,447
God damn it, Walter.

2367
01:43:58,488 --> 01:43:59,948
You fucking asshole!

2368
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:00,824
Dude, I知 sorry.

2369
01:44:00,866 --> 01:44:02,743
Everything's a fucking
travesty with you, man.

2370
01:44:02,784 --> 01:44:04,745
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

2371
01:44:04,786 --> 01:44:06,622
What was that shit
About Vietnam?

2372
01:44:06,663 --> 01:44:08,540
What the fuck
does anything

2373
01:44:08,582 --> 01:44:10,042
have to do
with Vietnam?

2374
01:44:10,083 --> 01:44:11,418
What the fuck are
you talking about?

2375
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:12,878
Dude, I知 sorry.

2376
01:44:15,672 --> 01:44:17,090
Fuckin'...

2377
01:44:23,889 --> 01:44:25,390
Fuck, Walter.

2378
01:44:26,767 --> 01:44:31,271
Come on, Dude.
Hey, fuck it, man.

2379
01:44:34,483 --> 01:44:35,984
Let's go bowling.

2380
01:44:58,382 --> 01:45:02,219
And when you're
sitting there

2381
01:45:02,261 --> 01:45:06,557
in your silk
upholstered chair

2382
01:45:06,598 --> 01:45:11,562
talkin' to some rich folks
that you know

2383
01:45:13,689 --> 01:45:17,651
well, I hope
you don't see me

2384
01:45:17,693 --> 01:45:21,446
in my ragged company

2385
01:45:21,488 --> 01:45:26,869
Aw, that you know
I could never be alone

2386
01:45:28,370 --> 01:45:30,247
2 oat sodas, Gary.

2387
01:45:30,289 --> 01:45:31,123
Good luck tomorrow.

2388
01:45:31,164 --> 01:45:32,624
Yeah, thanks, man.

2389
01:45:32,666 --> 01:45:34,543
I'm sorry to hear
about Donny.

2390
01:45:34,585 --> 01:45:37,838
Oh, well, yeah,
you know,

2391
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,256
Sometimes you
eat the bar,

2392
01:45:39,298 --> 01:45:42,134
And sometimes,
you know--

2393
01:45:42,176 --> 01:45:44,052
Hey, man!

2394
01:45:44,094 --> 01:45:45,554
Howdy doo, Dude.

2395
01:45:45,596 --> 01:45:47,431
I wondered if I壇
see you again.

2396
01:45:47,472 --> 01:45:49,349
I wouldn't
miss the semis?

2397
01:45:49,391 --> 01:45:50,851
How have things
been going?

2398
01:45:50,893 --> 01:45:52,728
Oh, you know,
strikes and gutters,

2399
01:45:52,769 --> 01:45:54,146
ups and downs.

2400
01:45:54,188 --> 01:45:55,647
Sure. I gotcha.

2401
01:45:55,689 --> 01:45:58,942
Yeah. Thanks, Gary.

2402
01:45:58,984 --> 01:46:01,445
Well, take care, man.
Gotta get back.

2403
01:46:01,486 --> 01:46:03,238
Sure. Take it
easy, Dude.

2404
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:04,156
Oh, yeah.

2405
01:46:04,198 --> 01:46:06,533
I know that you will.

2406
01:46:06,575 --> 01:46:10,579
Yeah, well,
The Dude abides.

2407
01:46:16,376 --> 01:46:19,296
The Dude abides.

2408
01:46:21,965 --> 01:46:26,345
I don't know about you,
but I take comfort in that.

2409
01:46:26,386 --> 01:46:30,057
It's good knowing he's
out there, The Dude.

2410
01:46:30,098 --> 01:46:33,435
Takin' her easy
for all us sinners.

2411
01:46:33,477 --> 01:46:38,732
Shoosh. I sure hope
he makes the finals.

2412
01:46:38,774 --> 01:46:40,651
Well, that about does her.

2413
01:46:40,692 --> 01:46:43,529
Wraps her all up.

2414
01:46:43,570 --> 01:46:45,447
Things seemed to have
worked out pretty good

2415
01:46:45,489 --> 01:46:47,824
for The Dude and Walter.

2416
01:46:47,866 --> 01:46:49,826
And it was
a pretty good story,

2417
01:46:49,868 --> 01:46:51,828
Don't you think?

2418
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:54,623
Made me laugh
to beat the band.

2419
01:46:54,665 --> 01:46:57,417
Parts, anyway.

2420
01:46:57,459 --> 01:47:00,838
I didn't like
seeing Donny go.

2421
01:47:00,879 --> 01:47:02,256
But then
I happen to know

2422
01:47:02,297 --> 01:47:07,052
That there's a little
Lebowski on the way.

2423
01:47:07,094 --> 01:47:09,555
I guess that's how the
whole darn human comedy

2424
01:47:09,596 --> 01:47:13,350
keeps perpetuating itself

2425
01:47:13,392 --> 01:47:15,727
down through
the generations.

2426
01:47:15,769 --> 01:47:17,229
westward in the wagons,

2427
01:47:17,271 --> 01:47:21,024
and across the sands
of time until we--

2428
01:47:21,066 --> 01:47:22,317
Oh, look at me.

2429
01:47:22,359 --> 01:47:25,237
I'm ramblin' again.

2430
01:47:25,279 --> 01:47:28,156
Well, I hope you folks
enjoyed yourselves.

2431
01:47:28,198 --> 01:47:31,535
Catch ya later
on down the trail.

2432
01:47:31,577 --> 01:47:33,453
Say, friend,
you got any more

2433
01:47:33,495 --> 01:47:35,497
of that good
Sarsaparilla?
