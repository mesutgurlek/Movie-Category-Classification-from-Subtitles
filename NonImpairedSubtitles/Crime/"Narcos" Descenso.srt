00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:40,723
[male narrator] Nowadays, the US
government can listen to anything you say.

7
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:44,143
They know where you are,
they know who you're talking to,

8
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:47,605
and trust me,
they know who you're fucking.

9
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:51,442
You turn on a cell phone or a computer,
and you're doomed.

10
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:56,656
But in Colombia in 1989,
it wasn't that easy.

11
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:58,950
First off,
there was no Internet.

12
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:00,451
No cells.

13
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:02,203
The best they had were satellite phones,

14
00:01:02,286 --> 00:01:06,541
and in order to capture a satellite phone,
you had to fly directly over it.

15
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:10,920
On top of that, the only people
who had sat phones were the filthy rich...

16
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,381
the landowners, the politicians...

17
00:01:14,757 --> 00:01:18,469
And lucky for us,
the narcos were richer than them all.

What's up, Lizard?

00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:27,603
We're going out tonight.

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,944
[narrator] And once you got a signal,
you didn't know who you were listening to.

22
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,614
That's why back then, the US government
developed software that could identify

23
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,158
- the voices of our targets.
- [indistinct chatter on headphones]

24
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:45,371
I got Poison at 400 to 1700 megahertz,
gentlemen.

25
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:48,499
And you guessed it:
no GPS either.

26
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,960
Hammer, prepare to engage.

27
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:54,463
[narrator] Once we got a target,
we still had to locate it.

28
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:58,300
So we had to triangulate their signals
using assets on the ground.

29

[chatter in Spanish over headphones]

OK, he's in Modelia.
He's on the west side.

Hawkeye, how do you copy that?

32

[man over radio] Can you be more specific?
Police units are standing by.

La Dispensaria.

34
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:14,859
I've got a table ready.

35
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,487
Show up around midnight.

36
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,616
- It's gonna be raining women.
- [narrator] Poison didn't know it,

37
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,910
but he'd just made himself a date.

38
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:27,914
Negative on Hammer. This fuckwad
just told us where he's going.

39
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:29,874
Hammer, disengage.

40
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,251
So who do we give this to? DEA?

41
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:35,838
- Yeah. Let's give it to Javier Peña.
- Peña's an asshole.

42
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,007
- I'm gonna give it to the other guy.
- Sure.

By "the other guy," he meant me.

45
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:45,723
I'm Steve Murphy,
Drug Enforcement Agent.

46
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:50,352
And as you can see,
I am deeply embedded in Colombia.

47
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,479
Hello?

48
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:54,023
[man] Poison will be partying
at La Dispensaria.

49
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:54,941
Got it.

50
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:57,652
He's meeting Lizard
and the rest of them at midnight tonight.

51
00:02:57,735 --> 00:02:59,070
OK.

52
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:01,739
[Steve] I would've loved
to go after Poison myself,

53
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:05,160
but the DEA is restricted
in a foreign country.

54
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:09,246
So I did just what you would do...
I called the cops.

55
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,498
Hola.

56

All right.

58
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:19,381
Guess who that was.

59
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:21,717
Your partner.

60
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,512
He just gave me a great gift.

00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:26,973
Poison.

62
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,063
Does he know
how I'm going to package it?

63
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:36,315
Yeah, sure.

64
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:38,526
He's not a fool.

65
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,820
Gotta go.

66
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:44,907
Gonna stick me with the bill?

67
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,455
Cheap son of a bitch.

68
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:54,167
[Steve] In case you're wondering,
this is the asshole.

Javier Peña, my partner.

70
00:03:57,336 --> 00:04:00,715
And this is Colonel Carrillo,
the leader of the Search Bloc,

71
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:03,759
the unit we helped create
to capture the bad guys.

Boy, did he have
a lot of love for the narcos.

[Steve]
Now, Poison, he was one of the best.

80
00:04:26,824 --> 00:04:30,619
Crazy motherfucker
who killed dozens of people.

81
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,163
Probably hundreds.

82
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,040
But don't get me wrong.

83
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:37,376
I would've sent Carrillo there
even if Poison never killed a fly.

84
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,963
I don't have a lot of love
for the narcos either.

[in Spanish]
It's on, boys!

00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:52,767
We're gonna stop on 14th
and go around the corner.

87
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,895
Riano, Trujillo,
you're in the front with me.

88
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:58,189
- Galvis and Silva, you take up the rear.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:04:58,273 --> 00:05:00,775
You got it, boys? We're gonna
go at it with everything we got.

90
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:03,652
We're gonna kill these fuckers,
all right?

[Steve]
Take Richard Nixon, for instance.

104
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,956
People forget,
but 47 million Americans voted for Nixon.

105
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,959
We thought he was one of the good guys.

106
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:27,255
And Nixon thought Chilean General Pinochet
was a good guy

107
00:07:27,504 --> 00:07:29,048
because he hated the commies.

108
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:31,717
So we helped Pinochet seize power.

109

[sirens wailing]

110
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:39,934
Then Pinochet turned around
and killed thousands of people.

Chile was on its way

to being the world's biggest
cocaine processing and exporting center.

[in Spanish] How many times do
I have to tell you not to waste the acid?

116
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:14,302
[Steve] They had deserts to hide the labs
and miles of unpatrolled coastline

117
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,511

He wasn't killed on that day.

Instead, he won the damn lottery.

Cockroach had been
stealing from his bosses for months.

143

Now he was left alone in the world
with the perfect product.

A product whose offer
creates its own demand.

We have to leave the country.

Cocaine hijacks

A rat will choose cocaine
over food and water.

It would choose cocaine over sleep,
over sex... over life itself.

00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:36,652
The human brain
isn't quite the same as a rodent's...

158
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:40,906
unless we're talking about cocaine.

159
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:49,373
Cockroach knew
he had the perfect product.

160
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:52,709
He just needed to smuggle it
to the right markets.

161
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:54,169
[Cockroach] Gracias.

162
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:58,924
And the best smugglers in the world
were in Colombia.

163
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:00,134
WELCOME TO COLOMBIA

164
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:02,637
[cheers and applause]

165
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,348
Like Goldilocks,
he had three options.

166
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,685
And pay attention, because all three
are important to this story.

167
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,568
The Ochoa brothers:
Jorge, that's Fabio on the horse.

168
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:21,363
- A typical Colombian smuggling family.
- [chatter in Spanish]

169
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,865
- They were smart and rich...
- [shouts] Salud!

170
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:27,119
...but Cockroach felt the high life
had made 'em too soft.

171
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:31,957
Another possible partner
was José Rodríguez Gacha,

172
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,836
nicknamed "The Mexican,"
for his love of tequila and sombreros.

173
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,714
He dominated the emerald smuggling routes.

174
00:11:38,922 --> 00:11:42,468
- [up-tempo Latin music plays]
- [indistinct chatter in Spanish]

175
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:49,183
Emeralds are a pretty rough trade,
even by Colombian standards.

176
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:50,767
If you make it to the top...

177
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:55,230
- it means you've killed your enemies.
- [people screaming]

178
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,360
[in Spanish]
Hey, partner. What are you doing here?

179
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:01,195
[Steve]
And sometimes, your partners.

180
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,037
Cockroach worried that the emerald trade
had made Gacha too hard.

181
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,671
So he zeroed in on his third option:
a man Cockroach knew would be just right.

182
00:12:18,754 --> 00:12:21,507
[in Spanish]

183
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,761
[Steve]
Yeah, you guessed it: Pablo Escobar.

184
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:28,180
The man who would
change my life forever.

185
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:33,394
Pablo was making a killing
in the smuggling business.

186
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:35,937
Cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana,
you name it.

187
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,817
At the time,
Pablo owned half the police in Medellín.

188
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:45,406
But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.

189
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:48,701
They didn't play by the same rules.

190
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:51,579
[Pablo speaking Spanish]
Good day.

191
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:53,622
Pablo Escobar?

192
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,123
Where's Felipo?

193
00:12:55,332 --> 00:12:57,251
Felipo's been arrested.

194
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:59,127
Bullshit. Felipo works for me.

195
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,214
He used to work for you. Now he's going
to jail. What do you think about that?

196
00:13:02,297 --> 00:13:04,717
- Do you know who you're talking to?
- Shut the fuck up.

197
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,927
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Relax, Gustavo, please.

198
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,596
Show some respect.

199
00:13:10,765 --> 00:13:13,016
Now what's the problem,
Mr. Jose Luis?

200
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:17,104
How do you know my name?

201
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:19,356
You're Colonel Jose Luis Herrera.

202
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:24,069
And that's Nacho Ibarra.

203
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:31,118
There's Garcia, Lopez...

204
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:33,245
- Is that Pinilla?
- [Gustavo] Yes, Pinilla.

205
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:34,455
- That's Pinilla.
- Yeah.

206
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:36,039
Pinilla...

207
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:37,958
and with Phillipe is Esparanza.

208
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,127
I don't give a rat's ass.
Open the fucking trucks.

209
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,754
I don't have all day.

210
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,551
Open it.

211
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,976
[Herrera chuckles]

212
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:58,604
Tell me something, Mr. Escobar.

213
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:01,398
Who the fuck do you think you are?

214
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:04,901
You don't even bother
to hide your contraband.

215
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:06,779
Because I pay for the privilege, Colonel.

216
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:08,572
Oh, yeah? You don't say.

217
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:10,449
Where are your import papers?

218
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,786
You need papers for these TV sets.

219
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:15,287
Take them.

220
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:16,913
[chuckles]

221
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:22,085
Sorry, Mr. Escobar. We're not
Medellín police making a shit salary.

222
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,505
- Look, brother, it's not for you.
- Then who?

223
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:26,381
It's for Carlitos.

224
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,425
Your son.

225
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:33,305
Wouldn't he like a TV in his room?

226
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,809
Hey, Pinilla!

227
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:42,189
Your daughter just
got her driver's license, right?

228
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:48,195
I've got some car stereo systems in there
that are really cool. Real nice.

229
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:53,492
That friend of yours, Lopez...
he's got a wife that's really beautiful.

230
00:14:53,575 --> 00:14:56,995
- Right? She's a fox.
- [Gustavo] Yeah.

231
00:14:57,078 --> 00:14:58,873
Your wife is gorgeous, brother.

232
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,834
What's she doing with a guy like you?

233
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:10,676
I think she deserves some jewelry, no?

234
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:15,890
Why don't I have my boys
drop off a few gifts?

235
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:22,479
Colonel, how is your mom doing?

236
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:25,733
- She just got out of the hospital, right?
- Yes, she's feeling better.

237
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:28,985
- Good. That makes us happy, right?
- [Gustavo] Yes.

238
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:31,530
Gentlemen...

239
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:34,783
I'm going to tell you who I am.

240
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:39,162
I am Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.

241
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:42,541
My eyes are everywhere.

242
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,587
That means you guys
can't move a finger in all of Antioquia

243
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,755
without me knowing about it.

244
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:50,925
Do you understand? Not a finger.

245
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:57,765
One day, I'm going to be
President of the Republic of Colombia.

246
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:02,895
So look, I make deals for a living.

247
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:06,523
Now, you can stay calm
and accept my deal...

248
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:09,860
or accept the consequences.

249
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,865
Silver...

250
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,076
or lead.

251
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,121
You decide.

252
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,711
- Let 'em go. Let 'em go.
- [Pablo] All right, then.

253
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:30,965
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

254
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:44,519
[vibrant Latin song playing]

255
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,383
[man shouts]
Yo, Pablo!

256
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:17,845
- This is Pablo.
- [Cockroach] Hello.

257
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:19,888
- Nice to meet you.
- [Gustavo] Mateo Moreno.

258
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,474
No, no, no.
"Cockroach" to my friends.

259
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:24,476
[Gustavo] All right,
yesterday we were talking,

260
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,023
and I think this business
can make us a lot of money.

261
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:30,482
Explain.

262
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:33,610
Well... I get the paste in Peru.

263
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:35,737
I will handle
the chemical part of production,

264
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,323
and all the other details
in producing this exquisite white powder.

265
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:40,826
What I need from you
is to help me get it into Colombia.

266
00:17:41,035 --> 00:17:44,287
- Now tell him how much it costs.
- [chuckles]

267
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:48,333
In Chile, this little thing
costs ten bucks a gram.

268
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:52,170
- They sell it by grams?
- Yes, it's very good. Look...

269
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:57,467
You do a little bit, and in 20 minutes,
you want to do some more.

270
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,053
Also...

271
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,472
it's a digestive aid.
It makes you want to take a shit.

272
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:05,100
It's very clean, this stuff.
Want some?

273
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:08,812
If this is really that good
and we can make some money,

274
00:18:08,896 --> 00:18:10,814
- we can find room on our trucks.
- [Cockroach sniffs]

275
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:13,358
We can sell it in Bogotá, Barranquilla,
Cali, Cartagena...

276
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,819
We're going to be rich.

277
00:18:15,903 --> 00:18:18,655
- What did you say your name was?
- Cockroach.

278
00:18:20,448 --> 00:18:22,117
Well look, Cuca...

279
00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:25,120
you don't have any vision,
my friend.

280
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:30,125
If it costs ten dollars a gram here...

281
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:34,379
imagine how much
it will sell for in Miami.

282
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:37,424
- [song ends]
- [grunts]

283
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:39,968
- [light applause]
- [Pablo] I love that song.

284
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:44,723
Rodrigo! One more.

285
00:18:44,806 --> 00:18:45,974
[stomps foot]

286
00:18:46,182 --> 00:18:48,226
[song begins again]

287
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:51,354
[singing along in Spanish]

288
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:10,582
[Steve]
Back then, Miami was a paradise.

289
00:19:10,665 --> 00:19:13,543
I signed up for the sand,
surf and women.

290
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:18,465
In '79, the bad guys I was chasing
wore flip-flops.

291
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:19,716
[Steve shouts]
DEA! Stop!

292
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:23,929
I was a young DEA agent,
partnered with my buddy, Kevin Brady.

293
00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:27,182
Kevin was a little slow afoot.

294
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:30,477
[grunts]

295
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,728
[Steve]
Why you running, huh?

296
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,815
What you got?
What is this? Huh?

297
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:35,816
What is that?

298
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:39,027
That right there...
that's a goddamn promotion.

299
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,196
- [laughs]
- [exhales] Let's go celebrate.

300
00:19:41,404 --> 00:19:42,864
- Whoo!
- Look at that.

301
00:19:43,073 --> 00:19:45,200
[disco music playing]

302
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:47,828
- Go! Go! Go!
- [laughing]

303
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:50,371
- [indistinct chatter]
- [Kevin] How you like me now?

304
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,623
How much money you owe me?

305
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:53,458
What happened to the money
you owed me last week?

306
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,169
That's right, that's right.

307
00:19:57,754 --> 00:20:00,757
All right.
All right, who do we pick?

308
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,467
How 'bout her?

309
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,969
No, no, no,
we gotta fuck with him.

310
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:06,054
- Yeah, let's mess with his head.
- Um...

311
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,973
Oh, right there.
See her? At the bar?

312
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:10,184
- Which one?
- Blue top, blond hair. That's his type.

313
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:13,353
- [Steve laughing] Oh! Strike!
- She's hot.

314
00:20:13,436 --> 00:20:14,729
- All right.
- Whoo!

315
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,940
[clears throat]
Murph! Sparrow, three o'clock.

316
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:20,861
Hey, while you were walking back,
she was checking your ass out.

317
00:20:20,944 --> 00:20:22,487
Oh, she was checking out your ass.

318
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,989
Get the fuck outta here.
Come on.

319
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:27,951
[Kevin] Listen, she eye-fucked you
the entire time you were bowling.

320
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:30,704
She was. She was eye-fucking you.
The entire time.

321
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:34,332
[snorts]
I'm serious, I'm serious. Look at her.

322
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,127
- Uh-huh. That's his type.
- Talking about the blond one?

323
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:38,753
No, the other one.
Of course the blond one.

324
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,547
She's the hottest one there.
She's your type.

325
00:20:41,297 --> 00:20:44,592
- You dicking me around?
- [Kevin laughs]

326
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:48,930
Fuck it, I'm going in.

327
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,182
- [Kevin] Go get her.
- [man] Mm!

328
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:52,059
- [Kevin] Yup.
- [man] Hey, while you're up there,

329
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:53,643
get us another pitcher, will ya?

330
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,855
- Pace yourself.
- Look at him. Look at his swagger.

331
00:20:57,064 --> 00:20:58,773
[men laughing]

332
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,984
[women talking indistinctly]

333
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,366
How you doing?

334
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,202
Busy.

335
00:21:11,828 --> 00:21:15,331
I just said, "Look, if you don't
wanna be there, you don't have to be.

336
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:18,626
No one's forcing you to do anything."
So, I don't know... [indistinct]

337
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,129
[men cackling]

338
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,674
[Steve]
Yeah, those bastards got me.

339
00:21:24,758 --> 00:21:27,094
But I couldn't let it end like that.

340
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:30,013
Excuse me. [clears throat]
See those guys over there?

341
00:21:31,306 --> 00:21:32,599
Uh, they're fucking with me.

342
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:36,144
Telling me you were checking out my ass,
and who checks out a cop's ass, right?

343
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,478
You're a cop?

344
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,898
Not a cop, actually. I'm DEA.

345
00:21:40,107 --> 00:21:41,149
Drug Enforcement?

346
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,235
So you're the one
making pot more expensive.

347
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,613
Come on, why don't you do me a favor?
[clears throat]

348
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:49,283
I wanna show these guys up.
Why don't you, uh...

349
00:21:49,365 --> 00:21:51,076
give me your phone number?

350
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,494
How about a fake number?

351
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,580
That'll work.

352
00:21:56,414 --> 00:21:58,125
Hey, buddy, you got a pen?

353
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,212
[sighs]

354
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:15,391
- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sure.

355
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,894
Have a good night.

356
00:22:20,563 --> 00:22:23,275
- [Kevin] Aah...
- [men laughing]

357
00:22:23,358 --> 00:22:24,525
[Kevin] Shot down!

358
00:22:25,693 --> 00:22:28,363
- Where's the pitcher at?
- The pitcher? Oh, I...

359
00:22:29,072 --> 00:22:30,531
I didn't make it back
with the pitcher.

360
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,994
I just came up with this and
I couldn't read it. What does that say?

361
00:22:34,077 --> 00:22:36,537
- Read it and weep!
- Aw... Gimme that.

362
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,290
How much did that cost you?

363
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:40,500
- That's your handwriting.
- It's not my handwriting!

364
00:22:44,587 --> 00:22:47,132
[dial tone]

365
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:49,592
- [dialing number]
- [Steve] I figured, what the hell.

366
00:22:49,676 --> 00:22:53,096
Worst that could happen,
I'd wake up some grandmother in Boca.

367
00:22:54,222 --> 00:22:56,350
[line ringing]

368
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:00,687
Hello?

369
00:23:02,189 --> 00:23:03,648
So it wasn't a fake.

370
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:06,193
I thought you might figure it out.

371
00:23:06,276 --> 00:23:08,695
After all, you're DEA.

372
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:12,157
[Steve]
And just like that... she had me.

373
00:23:13,574 --> 00:23:18,621
The minute Pablo laid his eyes
on the paste-processing labs in Peru,

374
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:20,498
cocaine had him.

375
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:24,919
[in Spanish]
It's been a while.

376
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,588
These are my friends,
Pablo and Gustavo.

377
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,092
Would you like a little coffee?

378
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,802
Yeah, a coffee?

379
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:33,887
Yes, a coffee.

380
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,055
- How about you, Pablo?
- No.

381
00:23:35,138 --> 00:23:36,681
[Cockroach]
You sure?

382
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:40,894
My factory is small,
but highly productive.

383
00:23:40,977 --> 00:23:45,857
Look. For crushing the leaves, I like to
use children because of their tiny feet.

384
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,610
Little magic leaves.

385
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,448
[man] The kerosene
separates the drug from the leaf.

386
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:59,495
[Cockroach] Over here, the sulfuric acid
distills and distills it.

387
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:04,667
Then you cut it,
and mix it with gasoline.

388
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:08,755
Then, basically, you pull the merchandise
out of the liquid.

389
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:10,673
Let it dry, dry, dry.

390
00:24:10,757 --> 00:24:12,508
[man]
You use ammonia to get the paste.

391
00:24:12,592 --> 00:24:18,139
[Cockroach] And here it is.
It's pasty... but pure.

392
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,475
Here is the prize.

393
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:22,977
It's like the kitchen in your house.

394
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:27,065
Like baking a cake.
[clears throat]

395
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,069
Only a much better cake
than you've ever had.

396
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:33,154
[chuckling]

397
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,365
Look, an old press, an antique.

398
00:24:39,827 --> 00:24:42,956
Now we put it in the oven.

399
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,666
Here's one.
The other will follow.

400
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,836
All natural, organic and healthy.
Very good.

401
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:51,089
[Gustavo] Well...

402
00:24:52,173 --> 00:24:55,635
- we'll take a kilo.
- A whole kilo. Perfect.

403
00:24:55,718 --> 00:24:58,930
- No.
- [man] You said a kilo.

404
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:00,432
We'll take five.

405
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:04,436
[softly]
How do we get five across the border?

406
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:06,396
That's Gustavo's department.

407
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,112
[man]
This one has got a good engine.

408
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:16,823
I was taking a look at it,
and the best place to hide the merchandise

409
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:19,117
would be under the rear wheel well.

410
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,328
It's 22 and one half horsepower.

411
00:25:21,411 --> 00:25:22,745
Is this easy to take off?

412
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:25,540
Don't worry about that shit.
I'll stick five kilos in there easy.

413
00:25:25,623 --> 00:25:28,001
All right, all right.
I'll take three cars, please.

414
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:31,045
- Sure, when do you need them?
- Now, brother.

415
00:25:31,838 --> 00:25:34,715
All right, we'll take the cars
and head back to the lab.

416
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,968
Why the fuck
are we going back to the lab?

417
00:25:37,051 --> 00:25:42,223
Because there are four wheel wells per car
and that's 20 kilos.

418
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,518
- For three cars, that's 60 kilos.
- [Pablo counting softly]

419
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,937
So if it's nine dollars
profit per gram, what?

420
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:49,564
$9,000 per kilo.

421
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:52,192
$9,000 times 60...
The profit is $540,000.

422
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:54,486
- [laughing]
- That's it!

423
00:25:54,569 --> 00:25:56,404
- Do you know how to drive, Cockroach?
- Yeah.

424
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,198
- OK, Pablo and I drive fast.
- [chuckling]

425
00:25:58,406 --> 00:26:02,160
[Steve]
That's half a million dollars... per trip,

426
00:26:02,243 --> 00:26:05,372
using the same smuggling routes
he always used.

427
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,959
Easiest money he ever made.

428
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:18,218
Back in Medellín,
Pablo didn't waste any time.

429
00:26:18,301 --> 00:26:19,969
He bought a house
in his old neighborhood

430
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:25,099
and opened his first lab to turn
Peruvian paste... into cocaine powder.

431
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,935
[in Spanish]
How are you feeling, Gustavo?

432
00:26:29,563 --> 00:26:31,523
All this smells like shit to me.

433
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:35,151
What an ignorant bastard.
It's like French cheese.

434
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:37,571
The stinkier, the better.

435
00:26:38,238 --> 00:26:39,489
All right.

436
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,325
What about all these lights?

437
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,413
Is that to tip off the cops,
or what?

438
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:50,833
Just worry about transporting the stuff
and selling it.

439
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:53,836
I'm the artist here, clear?

440
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,129
Clear.

441
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,257
- Right?
- Yeah. Mm-mm.

442
00:26:57,424 --> 00:27:01,719
[Steve] It was a mom-and-pop operation,
so small they called it The Kitchen.

443
00:27:01,802 --> 00:27:05,557
But make no mistake,
it would change Medellín forever.

444
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,101
[in Spanish] You know the thing
that has me worried, Pablo?

445
00:27:11,271 --> 00:27:12,897
[exhales]

446
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:17,569
Don't you think the workers
will choke with all that smoke?

447
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,365
[inhales deeply]

448
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,869
[voice strains]
Let's build them a chimney.

449
00:27:26,953 --> 00:27:29,080
- [sputtering]
- [giggles]

450
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:33,167
- There you go.
- [laughing]

451
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,171
[Gustavo]
Gentlemen, the first three?

452
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:40,716
If this business makes so much money,
why are you sending me coach?

453
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,843
We just started up.
We have to be careful with money.

454
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:46,180
- Don't be a dick.
- No, no, don't give me that dumb shit.

455
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,767
- Come on.
- How much can a first class ticket cost?

456
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,936
[Gustavo] I don't know.
Why don't you buy it yourself?

457
00:27:55,148 --> 00:27:58,985
[Steve] Like her son, Pablo's mother
Hermilda was very resourceful.

458
00:27:59,694 --> 00:28:03,197
[Pablo speaking Spanish] Hey, Mom,
how much do you think we can fit in there?

459
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:06,701
- Around five kilos, honey.
- That much?

460
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,202
Trust me, Pablito.

461
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,246
I love it. Let's do it.

462
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:16,252
- Pablo.
- Thank you, my love.

463
00:28:17,753 --> 00:28:19,213
[knocking at door]

464
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,590
It's Gustavo.

465
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,800
Five kilos, right?

466
00:28:22,883 --> 00:28:26,429
[Steve] Pablo loved his young bride Tata,
and she loved him.

467
00:28:26,513 --> 00:28:28,931
He was a family man till the end.

468
00:28:29,015 --> 00:28:32,185
The guy they got to wear the jacket
was the Lion.

469
00:28:32,268 --> 00:28:34,103
- Meet my friend.
- Hello, how are you doing?

470
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:35,313
Hey, Pablo, this is Lion.

471
00:28:35,396 --> 00:28:38,525
[Steve] He was a friend of Gustavo's who'd
spent his childhood in the United States.

472
00:28:38,608 --> 00:28:40,943
Says he wants to fly first class.
It's not like we're rich, right?

473
00:28:41,027 --> 00:28:43,029
Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
How are you?

474
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:44,656
- Lion.
- Pleased to meet you, Lion.

475
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:45,990
Here's three.

476
00:28:46,073 --> 00:28:48,702
We're going to need two more,
right, Mom?

477
00:28:48,784 --> 00:28:50,578
- [Hermilda] That's right.
- Pablito...

478
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:53,080
make sure it is not you
who wears it, OK?

479
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:56,417
Look, my love...
it won't fit me. [chuckles]

480
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,252
Try it on.

481
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,546
Come here.

482
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:01,422
That's it.

483
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,923
Good, right?

484
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:06,511
One...

485
00:29:07,762 --> 00:29:09,889
- two...
- Wow, it holds a lot!

486
00:29:09,972 --> 00:29:11,432
...three.

487
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,142
[sighs]

488
00:29:13,226 --> 00:29:15,269
- Two more.
- Got it. I'll be right back.

489
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,021
He looks really handsome,
doesn't he?

490
00:29:17,104 --> 00:29:19,982
[Hermilda] Listen, Lion,
that jacket fits you very nicely.

491
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:23,653
Yeah. Excuse me, ma'am, can you adjust
the jacket a little bit here in the back?

492
00:29:23,737 --> 00:29:25,238
- Aah!
- Listen to this guy.

493
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:27,407
He looks very handsome, son.

494
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,825
- Like a fag model, isn't that right?
- [chuckles]

495
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,830
[Steve] The Lion was one of the first guys
to ever bring coke into Miami.

496
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:39,252
Welcome to the United States.

497
00:29:39,335 --> 00:29:42,004
Thank you.
Have a great day.

498
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:42,963
Next, please.

499
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:46,842
[Steve] His contact was a crazy nut job
named Carlos Lehder,

500
00:29:46,926 --> 00:29:51,806
half Colombian, half German,
and 100 percent playboy.

501
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:55,184
Big fan of John Lennon and Adolf Hitler.

502
00:29:55,268 --> 00:29:57,061
Go figure.

503
00:29:57,144 --> 00:30:01,065
Back in '79, this piece of work
was flying bales of grass up from Colombia

504
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:02,734
on a fleet of small planes.

505
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:04,736
- [in Spanish] What's up?
- What's up, son?

506
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:06,862
- Welcome.
- Thanks a lot. How are ya?

507
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:08,448
- Everything good?
- Everything's good.

508
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:10,157
Whoo! It's so hot.

509
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,118
What the hell are you doing
with a jacket on?

510
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:13,578
You like my jacket, brother?

511
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:16,790
I got it in Colombia and look,
it has a little gift.

512
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,419
I was in jail for a while, remember?

513
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,548
I saw this shit there.
It's pure poison.

514
00:30:25,632 --> 00:30:28,426
What you got there
is the perfect product.

515
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:30,970
Pablo says the gringos
will fall in love with this shit.

516
00:30:31,053 --> 00:30:33,889
[laughs] It's gonna fuck up their brains,
that's for sure.

517
00:30:33,973 --> 00:30:35,015
Yes, sir.

518
00:30:38,728 --> 00:30:39,895
Here you go.

519
00:30:41,355 --> 00:30:43,483
Go on. There are five kilos.

520
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,318
Where are you going?

521
00:30:45,568 --> 00:30:47,987
I'm gonna get another jacket,
brother.

522
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,406
We'll meet at the same time tomorrow,
all right?

523
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,288
[Steve] The Lion made more than 20 flights
between Medellín and Miami.

524
00:30:57,371 --> 00:30:59,666
Drugs in, cash out.

525
00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:03,002
And the rich and famous in Miami
snorted every single gram of it.

526
00:31:03,085 --> 00:31:06,547
And in no time,
Pablo had to replace his cars with trucks.

527
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:10,217
Gustavo had the trucks
filled to the brim with potatoes,

528
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,679
the major item
Colombia imported from Peru.

529
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:15,765
He didn't even have to bribe the cops.

530
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,393
The coke paste
was hidden in the spare tires.

531
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,937
Each tire could fit about 20 kilos.

532
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:25,817
Ten trucks, 20 kilos each,
going back and forth every day...

533
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,987
You do the math.
No way the Lion could transport it all.

534
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,448
Pretty soon,
the Lion had to come up with new ways

535
00:31:32,532 --> 00:31:34,617
to smuggle the drug to Miami.

536
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:37,328
[in Spanish]
The briefcase doesn't have a false bottom?

537
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:39,914
You guys are pilots,

538
00:31:39,997 --> 00:31:43,376
so you can get this stuff by
without a problem.

539
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:49,298
Look, it's $150,000 per kilo,
so whatever you want.

540
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:52,343
We'll take four.

541
00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:53,887
All right, much better.

542
00:31:53,969 --> 00:31:58,683
Take these two and tell Jairo
to give you two more. All right?

543
00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:01,811
- All right.
- Perfect. Thank you very much.

544
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:03,437
- See you later.
- Later.

545
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,148
Come in, please.

546
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,031
Look, here are the packets.

547
00:32:14,114 --> 00:32:17,702
You take a packet...
you dip it in the oil and swallow it.

548
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:19,078
Easy, right?

549
00:32:19,161 --> 00:32:21,706
You swallow 50,
and I pay you $10,000.

550
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:22,874
All right?

551
00:32:22,957 --> 00:32:25,042
But with you two,
we have a problem.

552
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:27,044
You girls are pregnant, right?

553
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:31,758
That's good, because US Customs
won't search pregnant women.

554
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:36,679
You two can easily swallow 70
instead of 50.

555
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:39,891
And I'll pay you $15,000
to help you with the kids.

556
00:32:39,974 --> 00:32:42,435
All right? All right. Perfect.

557
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,355
[Steve] During the early '80s,
most flights out of Bogotá

558
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:48,274
had several mules on them.

559
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:50,443
They didn't even know about each other.

560
00:32:50,526 --> 00:32:52,111
And you know what?

561
00:32:52,194 --> 00:32:56,323
Getting in was easy, because nobody
worried about cocaine in America.

562
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,367
All we cared about was grass.

563
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:01,370
[clucking]

564
00:33:01,454 --> 00:33:05,959
Pretty soon, cocaine was hidden in
almost every legitimate Colombian export.

565
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:10,087
Fish, coffee, flowers, rubber hoses...
anything.

566
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:29,148
But even that didn't do it.

567
00:33:30,024 --> 00:33:34,487
The real game changer was filling
Lehder's planes with coke instead of weed.

568
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,700
[in Spanish]
Do you trust this guy?

569
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,369
I don't know.
He was in prison in the United States.

570
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:45,539
- So is he gay or what?
- Oh, for sure he's gay.

571
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,249
But he's got good routes.

572
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:52,964
- Amigos!
- [Gustavo] Hello, Carlos.

573
00:33:53,047 --> 00:33:54,423
Gustavo Gaviria,
nice to meet you.

574
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:55,758
- Nice to meet you.
- My cousin.

575
00:33:55,842 --> 00:33:57,677
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.
Nice to meet you.

576
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,763
- Cousin? Nice to meet you.
- How was your flight?

577
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:02,348
Smooth.

578
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:03,683
Let's get down to business.

579
00:34:03,766 --> 00:34:07,645
The Lion tells us you've been transporting
a lot of marijuana in your plane.

580
00:34:07,728 --> 00:34:10,982
- That's true.
- About how much per flight?

581
00:34:11,774 --> 00:34:13,776
- How far?
- Miami.

582
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,944
[sighs]

583
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:20,240
- Somewhere around 1000 kilos.
- [Gustavo] 1000 kilos?

584
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:22,076
Counting the gasoline.

585
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:32,003
Carlos...

586
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,005
[Carlos] Yes?

587
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:41,428
What if we take out the seats,
the carpet and all the other crap

588
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:45,307
and only leave space for the pilot?
Can you fit more?

589
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:47,142
We'll leave the engine, right?

590
00:34:48,435 --> 00:34:49,937
- How much more?
- [chuckles]

591
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,439
About... 300 more.

592
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:57,486
All right then, Mr. Carlos.
Let's take a walk.

593
00:35:00,114 --> 00:35:01,908
[Steve]
Within months after meeting Cockroach,

594
00:35:01,991 --> 00:35:07,080
Pablo was establishing the first dedicated
narco routes from Colombia to America.

595
00:35:08,414 --> 00:35:11,751
It was a real milestone
in the story of narcotics, folks.

596
00:35:12,752 --> 00:35:15,922
Then Pablo closed The Kitchen
and started opening cocaine labs

597
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:17,506
in the middle of the jungle.

598
00:35:20,175 --> 00:35:22,553
Under the canopy cover
of the Colombian rainforest,

599
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:27,641
he could expand his production capability
indefinitely without anybody noticing it.

600
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:31,562
[clanging]

601
00:35:31,645 --> 00:35:33,940
[in Spanish]
We brought you a little present.

602
00:35:34,023 --> 00:35:35,816
- [chatter in Spanish]
- [woman laughs]

603
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,317
[Pablo]
Brazilians.

604
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:42,197
Best asses in the world,
believe me.

605
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:44,784
No, I'm not feeling well.

606
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:46,410
- What's up, Cuca?
- Hello.

607
00:35:47,286 --> 00:35:48,370
Hey, Gustavo.

608
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:51,832
What the fuck is up with you guys?

609
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,585
You're flying around in planes...

610
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:56,963
- while I'm rotting here in this jungle?
- Look, Cuca--

611
00:35:57,046 --> 00:35:59,715
Look, let us explain what we have to--

612
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:01,467
Wait.

613
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,845
From now on,
in all of my labs...

614
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:09,516
I'll build a large house
with air-conditioning, with a pool...

615
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,019
- [Gustavo] And whores from Brazil.
- ...and whores from Brazil.

616
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,521
- Just for you.
- One problem.

617
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:18,525
These are my labs. Mm?

618
00:36:24,406 --> 00:36:28,619
Relax.
No one's arguing with you.

619
00:36:28,702 --> 00:36:31,122
Come show me the production
and we'll talk later.

620
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:34,458
[Steve] Pablo couldn't hide his success
from his friends.

621
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:38,212
They were violent, crazy and filthy rich.

622
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:41,507
Guys used to getting what they want,
one way or another.

623
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:45,302
[in Spanish] How something like this
can make so much money!

624
00:36:45,385 --> 00:36:49,556
Now I ask myself...
if I should get involved with this.

625
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,600
What do you think, Pablo?

626
00:36:51,684 --> 00:36:54,061
I heard the "potato" business
is like the "egg" business.

627
00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:55,813
I wouldn't get involved.

628
00:36:55,896 --> 00:36:59,150
Look, man,
I took a good look at the market.

629
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:01,485
Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.

630
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:05,948
- Of course. Same old contraband routes.
- Mm.

631
00:37:06,032 --> 00:37:08,951
Be careful, guys. If we all start
buying potatoes at the same time,

632
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,746
the Peruvians will raise the price.

633
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:16,750
They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.

634
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:20,254
We can reduce the cost of
the refining process if we buy together.

635
00:37:20,337 --> 00:37:25,092
Well, guys, the hard part
is getting the merchandise to Miami.

636
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,555
You need a lot of creativity for that.

637
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:33,809
How much would you charge us
to be "creative"?

638
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:37,688
You deliver the product to me, labeled.

639
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:41,316
I will take it to Miami
and deliver it to your contact there.

640
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,986
Better yet, Lehder will do it.

641
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,156
I'll charge 35 percent of the sales value,

642
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,744
but I'll insure the safety of your load
up to 50 percent of the value.

643
00:37:51,827 --> 00:37:53,662
The potato business is ours.
We don't need--

644
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,497
Deal?

645
00:37:58,751 --> 00:37:59,919
Deal.

646
00:38:00,627 --> 00:38:02,213
Sounds good to me.

647
00:38:03,672 --> 00:38:07,676
All right,
I will create my own routes

648
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,305
and stop using your services
as soon as possible. OK?

649
00:38:11,388 --> 00:38:13,266
[Gustavo]
We expect nothing less, Gonzalo.

650
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:15,726
Partners?

651
00:38:19,813 --> 00:38:22,608
We know your policy toward partners.

652
00:38:24,193 --> 00:38:25,861
Let's just call us...

653
00:38:26,112 --> 00:38:27,696
"friendly associates."

654
00:38:29,531 --> 00:38:30,991
To Miami.

655
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,160
[all]
To Miami!

656
00:38:34,954 --> 00:38:36,538
[up-tempo '80s rock music plays]

657
00:38:43,337 --> 00:38:47,841
[Steve] When I started, a one-kilo
grass bust was cause for celebration.

658
00:38:54,056 --> 00:38:57,768
And before long,
we were seizing 60 kilos of coke a day.

659
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,316
We thought we were
making a huge difference.

660
00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:12,325
Truth is,
we weren't even making a dent.

661
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,578
They let us have 60
so they could bring in 600.

662
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,007
Pablo's coke flooded in.

663
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:31,551
It didn't take long
for Miami to get addicted.

664
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,095
And I mean that.

665
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:37,350
It was like the whole city was
running around trying to get this shit.

666
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:40,353
And with the money...

667
00:39:41,436 --> 00:39:43,314
came the violence.

668
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:47,484
The hippies had been
replaced by Colombians,

669
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:50,237
and these guys didn't wear flip-flops.

670
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,223
The Miami coroner
said Colombians were like Dixie cups.

671
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:21,143
Use 'em once,
then throw 'em away.

672
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:26,648
The Dade County morgue couldn't
fit all the bodies from the drug war.

673
00:40:26,732 --> 00:40:29,609
They had to rent a refrigerated truck
from a local company

674
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,653
to hold all the extra corpses.

675
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,699
That was the first person I ever shot.

676
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,161
A teenager not old enough
to buy a six-pack.

677
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,975
Hey... it was self-defense.

678
00:41:02,184 --> 00:41:05,145
- Kevin called you?
- He's worried about you.

679
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,148
Did he forget to tell you
the kid was 17?

680
00:41:09,149 --> 00:41:10,776
He sells drugs, right?

681
00:41:12,194 --> 00:41:14,071
- Yeah.
- Yeah, then fuck him.

682
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:16,949
[sighs]

683
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,371
What happened?

684
00:41:25,665 --> 00:41:28,210
- Coming through!
- [Connie] I was about to finish my shift

685
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:30,545
when we got hit
with the lights and sirens.

686
00:41:30,629 --> 00:41:31,964
Stay with me.

687
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:33,632
I have an unconscious pregnant female.

688
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,719
Paramedics said she collapsed
after she got off her flight.

689
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:41,265
By the time she got to us,
she was barely breathing.

690
00:41:41,348 --> 00:41:45,102
- [nurse] Pressure 60 over 40.
- Dilated pupils, rapid pulse.

691
00:41:45,185 --> 00:41:47,646
- I knew she'd overdosed on cocaine...
- [flatline tone]

692
00:41:47,729 --> 00:41:51,442
...but she had no residue on her nostrils,
no injection marks.

693
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,654
We did everything we could.

694
00:41:56,738 --> 00:41:58,365
She died in the ER.

695
00:42:00,742 --> 00:42:02,536
We tried to save the baby...

696
00:42:08,041 --> 00:42:10,085
The baby died in my hands.

697
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:14,340
I'm so sorry.

698
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:18,093
She was body-packing
11 ounces of cocaine.

699
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:20,720
Two of the pellets split open.

700
00:42:22,597 --> 00:42:26,268
[sighs]
Twelve grams in her bloodstream.

701
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:30,272
No one survives that.

702
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:36,570
[bugs chirring]

703
00:42:37,904 --> 00:42:41,325
[in Spanish]
Why won't Pablo ever see me?

704
00:42:41,408 --> 00:42:45,120
I spent all this time
waiting around for him.

705
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:47,373
Tell me something, Cockroach.

706
00:42:47,456 --> 00:42:50,083
Did you ever think
you were going to have this much money?

707
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,670
[dry chuckle] Fuck the money.
I'm talking renegotiation.

708
00:42:53,753 --> 00:42:58,717
If it wasn't for me, you two
would still be smuggling cigarettes.

709
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,594
Let me give you a piece of advice.

710
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,056
Never say that to Pablo.

711
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:07,142
He's not as forgiving as I am.

712
00:43:13,148 --> 00:43:15,234
[Steve]
Pablo was fucking Cockroach over.

713
00:43:15,442 --> 00:43:18,695
But Cockroach
should've listened to Gustavo.

714
00:43:18,778 --> 00:43:22,616
Instead, he found another way
to get his fair share.

715

- [man shouts in Spanish] Stop!
- [chatter in Spanish]

716
00:43:38,424 --> 00:43:40,509
What do you have in the spare tires?

717
00:43:43,303 --> 00:43:46,681
390 kilos, Pablo.
We lost it.

718
00:43:47,766 --> 00:43:51,019
Gustavo, what do you mean
"we lost it"?

719
00:43:51,103 --> 00:43:52,979
Just what I said, we lost it.

720
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:59,194
We lost it? It just disappeared?
Into thin air or what?

721
00:43:59,278 --> 00:44:02,322
Don't mess with me, Pablo.
We lost it.

722
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:05,700
It looks like the cops must have stopped
the guys when they were leaving Ipsalia.

723
00:44:06,993 --> 00:44:08,120
Look...

724
00:44:09,121 --> 00:44:14,418
we've paid every cop
from here to Ipsalia.

725
00:44:16,378 --> 00:44:18,422
So how did we lose a load, brother?

726
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:21,883
It looks like Colonel Herrera
suddenly turned honest.

Too much.

[Herrera]
You can go now, officer.

758
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,144
Sit down, Mr. Pablo.

759
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:28,278
We counted more than 300 kilos
in those trucks.

760
00:47:30,196 --> 00:47:35,201
That's a street value
of over four million dollars, Mr. Escobar.

761
00:47:35,952 --> 00:47:38,371
And you only gave us $150,000.

762
00:47:39,914 --> 00:47:42,501
Well, that's what we agreed upon.

You know something?

00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,674
I make deals for a living.

765

Now you can either accept my deal
or accept the consequences. You decide.

766
00:47:57,516 --> 00:48:00,686
Or we can renegotiate,
come to an agreement,

767

and everyone goes home happy.

768

What is it?

773
00:48:26,127 --> 00:48:30,006
Someone in my organization
gave you the street value of my cocaine.

774

Otherwise, how would you know?

00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,688
and you won't have
to split the cash with him.

777
00:48:48,441 --> 00:48:51,820
[Steve]
Turns out Cockroach was a real cockroach.

778
00:48:51,904 --> 00:48:55,073
Not only did he sell Pablo
to the authorities,

779
00:48:55,156 --> 00:48:58,827
he was stealing from him all along
and selling his coke in Miami, too.

780
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:06,125
Cockroach's dealer was Germán Zapata,
a Colombian with a plumbing business

781
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,921
that served as a front
for his cocaine operation.

782
00:49:10,088 --> 00:49:14,843
He had 1200 keys in the van...
and guess who was buying the load?

783
00:49:18,137 --> 00:49:19,723
The plan was to trade vehicles,

784
00:49:19,806 --> 00:49:22,893
and Zapata would be arrested
once he left the port.

785
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:27,105
1200 kilos.

786
00:49:27,188 --> 00:49:30,024
That would get us
on the cover of the Miami Herald.

787
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:33,612
OK, gringos.

788
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,697
How's the plumbing business?

789
00:49:35,781 --> 00:49:37,115
Fine.

790
00:49:37,198 --> 00:49:38,825
[murmur greetings in Spanish]

791
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:43,580
- [speaking English] How's it look?
- Plumbing business is very good.

792
00:49:43,663 --> 00:49:45,290
[Kevin chuckles]

793
00:49:45,373 --> 00:49:47,500
Come on, amigo.
I'll show you.

794
00:49:49,085 --> 00:49:50,629
[Steve]
Everything was going perfect.

795
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:55,717
Like I said, amigo...
100 percent pure.

796
00:49:55,801 --> 00:49:57,719
[Steve]
Except that Pablo was onto Cockroach.

797
00:49:57,803 --> 00:50:00,472
- Got a full load here, Murph--

[car alarm wailing]

800
00:50:06,019 --> 00:50:07,270
[single gunshot]

801
00:50:08,062 --> 00:50:10,690
Don't move! Don't move.

802
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:13,902
- Don't move! Don't move.
- [man speaks Spanish]

803
00:50:13,986 --> 00:50:15,278
Get down!

804
00:50:18,698 --> 00:50:21,034
- Hands! Down!
- [car alarm stops]

805
00:50:21,117 --> 00:50:22,201
Don't look at me.

806
00:50:25,705 --> 00:50:26,915
[whispers] Fucking...

807
00:50:46,518 --> 00:50:51,064
In the case of
the State of Florida v. Juan Diego Díaz,

808
00:50:51,147 --> 00:50:54,275
after taking into account
all due considerations,

809
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:59,572
bail has been set at two million dollars,
or a bond of $200,000.

810
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:00,824
[slams gavel]

811
00:51:00,907 --> 00:51:04,243
[Steve] I got to the courthouse early
the day of La Quica's trial.

812
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,413
My testimony was gonna
put that bastard on death row.

813
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:13,086
The US District Attorney said La Quica
met his bail of two million dollars,

814
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:17,883
paid by a wire transfer from, well...
why don't you take a guess?

815
00:51:19,133 --> 00:51:22,428
La Quica boarded
and was back in Medellín by midnight.

816
00:51:25,223 --> 00:51:31,563
From '79 to '84,
there were 3,245 murders in Miami.

817
00:51:32,647 --> 00:51:34,858
And outside the Tourist Bureau
and the cops,

818
00:51:35,067 --> 00:51:37,360
no one much cared about that.

819
00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:41,907
What got the US government
to take notice was the money.

820
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:46,536
Billions of dollars a year,
all flowing from the US to Colombia.

821
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:50,623
And that... America couldn't take.

822
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:56,462
A group of powerful businessmen
went and met with President Reagan.

823
00:51:56,671 --> 00:52:00,717
They were terrified the narco economy
would sink the real economy of Miami.

824
00:52:01,634 --> 00:52:06,098
Or... maybe they were pissed off
that they weren't getting a cut.

825
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:09,601
Whatever it was, the businessmen
came at just the right time.

826
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:12,520
It's back-to-school time
for America's children...

827
00:52:12,604 --> 00:52:15,982
[Steve] It was time for America
to suit up against a new enemy.

828
00:52:16,816 --> 00:52:19,235
Drugs are menacing our society.

829
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:22,864
They're threatening our values
and undercutting our institutions.

830
00:52:22,948 --> 00:52:25,033
They're killing our children.

831
00:52:25,117 --> 00:52:26,910
[Steve]
It was classic Reagan.

832
00:52:26,993 --> 00:52:29,913
Folksy, direct and tough.

833
00:52:29,996 --> 00:52:33,249
He vowed to go after drugs
at the source.

834
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:35,668
But it was Nancy who stole the show.

835
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:39,965
So to my young friends out there,
life can be great.

836
00:52:40,048 --> 00:52:42,175
But not when you can't see it.

837
00:52:42,258 --> 00:52:47,472
So open your eyes to life, to see it
in the vivid colors that God gave us

838
00:52:47,555 --> 00:52:49,849
as a precious gift to His children.

839
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,935
Say yes to your life.

840
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:56,314
And when it comes to drugs and alcohol...
just say no.

841
00:52:56,397 --> 00:52:58,858
No, no, no!
No, Pablo, no, no!

842
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,026
- No, no!
- [gunshot]

843
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:00,944
[gasps]

844
00:53:04,656 --> 00:53:08,034
[Steve] They say when a nuclear holocaust
destroys the world,

845
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,120
only the cockroaches will survive.

846
00:53:10,203 --> 00:53:12,330
Leave that piece of shit there.

847
00:53:12,413 --> 00:53:14,290
[Steve]
I guess they were wrong.

848
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:19,337
During his career,
Pablo would kill over a thousand cops.

849
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:22,132
But I wouldn't learn that till later.

850
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:31,933
My dad volunteered to fight
in World War II because of Pearl Harbor.

851
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,186
But you think he knew anybody in Hawaii?

852
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,604
No way.

853
00:53:37,271 --> 00:53:41,818
He was a West Virginia farm boy,
but these fuckers stepped on our soil.

854
00:53:42,777 --> 00:53:45,613
So he laced up his army boots
and went to fight.

855
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:48,158
It was his duty.

856
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:51,953
Cocaine in Miami?

857
00:53:52,037 --> 00:53:53,955
Kilos from Colombia?

858
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,333
This was my war.

859
00:53:57,416 --> 00:53:59,919
This was my duty.

860
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,796
And I was ready to fight it.

861
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,465
And my wife was ready
to fight it with me, too.

862
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:05,758
Your ticket, please.

863
00:54:07,135 --> 00:54:08,302
OK.

864
00:54:08,386 --> 00:54:11,389
We had no idea
what we were in for.

865
00:54:12,765 --> 00:54:17,062
One year later... all that patriotic
bullshit was right out the window.

866
00:54:17,145 --> 00:54:18,813
[Javier over radio]
OK, man, what do we got?

867
00:54:18,897 --> 00:54:22,025
- We got Poison...
- Excellent. Who else?

868
00:54:22,108 --> 00:54:23,442
We got Lizard.

869
00:54:24,569 --> 00:54:26,320
Uh...

870
00:54:26,404 --> 00:54:27,822
We got, we got...

871
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,536
- Big Badmouth.
- That motherfucker.

872
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:36,289
- Thank you for the gift, agent.
- No problem.

873
00:54:37,999 --> 00:54:39,167
[camera shutter clicks]

874
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:55,975
[Steve] If there's one thing
I've learned in the narco world,

875
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:59,062
it's that life is more complicated
than you think.

876
00:55:00,105 --> 00:55:03,775
Good and bad...
they're relative concepts.

877
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:08,947
In the world of drug dealers,
you do what you think is right...

878
00:55:09,864 --> 00:55:11,908
- and hope for the best.
- [camera shutter clicks]

879
00:55:13,034 --> 00:55:15,620
[man speaks Spanish]
Look at what happened, boss.

880
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:18,039
They killed Poison at La Dispensaria.

881
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:23,920
- Who did it?
- I think it was Carrillo.

882
00:55:24,003 --> 00:55:27,132
And there was a gringo DEA agent
taking pictures.

883
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:33,888
- Raise the bounty.
- On Carrillo, sir?

884
00:55:36,141 --> 00:55:39,769
I'll pay half a million
for the head of a DEA agent.

885
00:55:39,852 --> 00:55:41,313
Half a million?

886
00:55:41,395 --> 00:55:42,605
Do it.

887
00:55:42,688 --> 00:55:44,190
As you wish, sir.

888
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,447
Fucking gringos.
