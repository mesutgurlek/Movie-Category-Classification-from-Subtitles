00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,018
Oh hey, Uncle Tommy.

3
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:33,284
Hey.

4
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,764
During the last week of summer,
we were downtown... one fine day.

5
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,877
One day, I was with Jared,
who's a little older than me.

6
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,979
He said we should check out
Paranoid Park.

7
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,241
I had heard of it, of course...

8
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,544
But I'd never thought of going there.

9
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,209
I assumed it was out of my league.

10
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,615
But when I said,
"I don't think I'm ready..."

11
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,621
...Jared laughed
and said something like,

12
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,749
"Nobody's ever ready
for Paranoid Park."

13
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,828
We went to the park together
the next day.

14
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,562
Dude, this place is tight.
We should hit it up on Saturday.

15
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,770
About a month later,
halfway through math class,

16
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,932
there was an announcement. My name.
My name, and no others.

17
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,944
OK, so today I really really want to
teach you guys about buoyant force,

18
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,846
and... buoyant force is the force
that's exerted upon an object...

19
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:02,444
um, but... The funny thing is objects
tend to uh... differ... in shape...

20
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,180
Will Alex Tremain report
to the front office.

21
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,620
Alex Tremain to the front office.

22
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,191
We have objects like this,
like you see,

23
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,055
divided in the middle...

24
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,254
But an object can also... Oh.

25
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,403
OK, sorry about that...

26
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,643
Hey there, Alex. Come have a seat.

27
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:06,780
Hey.

28
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,982
Sorry I pulled you out of class.

29
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,549
Uh, that's all right.

30
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,026
So... Anyway,
I talked to your friend Jared.

31
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,427
He says you almost went
by the Eastside Skateboard Park

32
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,033
on the night of the seventeenth.
Is that right?

33
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:22,998
Yeah.

34
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,600
OK, did you drive around out
that night or...?

35
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:26,227
Did I what?

36
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,896
Did you drive around that night?

37
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,368
Um... yeah...

38
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,469
OK.
Did you drive... by there that night?

39
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:35,478
The park itself.

40
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,582
No.

41
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:37,943
Where did you go?

42
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,952
That night, I drove around downtown,
and got something to eat,

43
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,318
parked down near the waterfront
and then walked around.

44
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,015
OK. Were you skateboarding?

45
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:49,924
Yeah. Well, no.
I had my skateboard but...

46
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,292
I'm not that good
so I try to practice by myself.

47
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,265
OK. And... so you can give me times
for these things,

48
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,302
right, I mean approximately?

49
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:02,134
Yeah. Um, I went to Jared's around
seven or eight...

50
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,142
and then I dropped him off
at the bus station shortly after that.

51
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,007
And then drove around...

52
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,848
Oh yeah, that's something I got confused
about before 'cause...

53
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:13,110
I didn't go back to my house,
I went back to Jared's 'cause...

54
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,846
Jared and I planned to stay at his house
that night... originally.

55
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,855
OK, that's fine.
So, where was his parents?

56
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:23,121
His mom was... in Las Vegas and...
his dad doesn't live with them.

57
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,422
OK, so no brothers or sisters,

58
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,464
so the house was totally empty then,
right?

59
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,588
Yeah.

60
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,495
Did your parents know this?

61
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,125
I mean that...
nobody was home at Jared's?

62
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,431
Uh, it's not like
they cared or anything.

63
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,304
OK... Uh well no, that's... that's fine,

64
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,377
I mean... it's probably
that old trick where...

65
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,208
you tell your parents you're gonna
spend the night at Jared's house and...

66
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,340
your parents don't realize
that his parents aren't home and...

67
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,714
basically you get to do
whatever you want.

68
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,753
Pretty much, I m...
it's not like my mom cares.

69
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,120
No, that's fine, I used to do that.
I mean that's an old one. No big deal.

70
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,021
Yeah.

71
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,787
What is your parental situation?

72
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,690
What do you mean?

73
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,990
Well, your parents.
Are they... still together?

74
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,996
They've been separated
for a while and they're...

75
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,794
gonna get a divorce soon.

76
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,130
Yeah, all right.
Yeah, my parents got a divorce.

77
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,865
I mean... in fact I think
I was about your age.

78
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,998
I know it's kind of a tough thing to...
go through...

79
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:11,166
Yeah...

80
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,040
Uh... do you have any...
brothers or sisters?

81
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,671
Yeah. I have a little brother,
and he's thirteen.

82
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,805
OK, how 'bout a sister?

83
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,110
No.

84
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,082
Uh... how 'bout a girlfriend?

85
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,881
Yeah... Jennifer.

86
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,751
Jennifer? And where was she that night?

87
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,720
- My girlfriend?
- Uh huh.

88
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,224
She was with... just some other friends.

89
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,090
OK. Did you happen to call her
that night at any point?

90
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,457
I mean, do you have a cell phone?

91
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,065
No, I didn't call her and,
I don't have a cell phone.

92
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,967
OK. Uh... well...
Just goin' through my notes,

93
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:44,065
I'll tell you what... uh...
Let me tell you what my situation is...

94
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,507
I have this security guard...

95
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,739
and we find him deceased
on the railroad tracks.

96
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,883
And so we're thinking maybe he tripped,
or he fell.

97
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,812
But, the autopsy says he was struck
by an object.

98
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,019
And... we also have a witness
that says...

99
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,150
he saw somebody throw something over
the bridge into the river.

100
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:05,320
We happen to have that object
and it's a skateboard.

101
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,490
Now the funny thing is there's
some DNA evidence on the skateboard,

102
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,693
that puts it at the scene of the crime.

103
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,368
Where did you go?

104
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:22,413
I... drove around, downtown a little
to Subway and got something to eat.

105
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,243
OK, there's about a thousand
and two Subways.

106
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,112
- Which one did you go to?
- By the waterfront.

107
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,585
OK, and the one... over in the,
World Trade Center? That one?

108
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:30,279
Yes.

109
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,720
OK. What'd you get?

110
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,691
Turkey and ham on... Italian herb
and cheese bread, toasted...

111
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:39,389
tomato lettuce pickle olive mustard oil
and vinegar...

112
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,430
Did you get mayo?

113
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:40,964
No.

114
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,828
Gotta have mayo with that.

115
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:42,831
Mayo's sick.

116
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,435
Mayo's sick. What kind of bread was it?

117
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,003
Italian herb and cheese.

118
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,162
OK, you have a receipt
in your pocket for that?

119
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,331
No, I don't keep... Subway receipts.

120
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,271
OK, how much did it cost then?

121
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,604
Like... six something,
Subway's expensive.

122
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:53,803
Six-inch twelve-inch?

123
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:54,435
Six.

124
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,842
Six-inch, for six bucks,

125
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,175
so you must have got the meal,
then, right?

126
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,442
No, I just got a drink.

127
00:11:58,584 --> 00:11:59,312
OK, all right...

128
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:00,316
Large, Dr. Pepper.

129
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,078
Who'd you eat with?

130
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,383
Myself. I drove by myself, so...

131
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:09,890
OK... You know I gotta cut
this short... um...

132
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,495
Let me give you my business card.

133
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,731
If you have anything to add...
I want you to give me a call all right?

134
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,832
- OK.
- You do that?

135
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,771
So, can I go back to class?

136
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,376
Yeah, you can. Thanks. Appreciate it.

137
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,344
I'm writing this a little out of order.

138
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:39,422
Sorry, I didn't do so well,
in creative writing.

139
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:43,392
But... I'll get it all on paper,
eventually.

140
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,084
What are you writing?

141
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,351
Oh nothin', just homework.

142
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,584
Good day for it.

143
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,723
Anyway, after Jared had mentioned
Paranoid Park,

144
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,696
that first time,
we ended up going the next day.

145
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:19,340
It wasn't the night the police detective
was talking about, though.

146
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,606
But it was my first time there,
and I liked it right away.

147
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,612
One appeal of a place like Paranoid
was the kids that skated there.

148
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:31,085
They had built the park illegally all
by themselves.

149
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:36,326
Trainhoppers... guitar punks...
skate... drunks...

150
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:40,125
throwaway kids...
No matter how bad your family life was,

151
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,256
these guys had it much worse.

152
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:22,432
Dude this place is tight.
We should hit it up on Saturday.

153
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,666
That sounds like fun.

154
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:28,245
The first problem with Jared's
plan was Jennifer... my girlfriend.

155
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,041
Yeah but like, you, I don't know,

156
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,047
you like hanging out with him better
than me it seems sometimes

157
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,014
and it's kind of annoying.

158
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,552
She wanted me to hang out
with her that night.

159
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:40,486
Don't... no. No, you cannot... no.
You can't do that.

160
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,891
You can't call my friends,
like... it's... no.

161
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,760
Jennifer was nice and everything...
but... she was a virgin.

162
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,333
Which meant she'd want to do it...

163
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,867
...at some point.

164
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,604
And then I knew things
would get all serious.

165
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,107
I told my mom I was spending
Saturday night at Jared's

166
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,938
so we could go to the winter sports
expo earlier on Sunday.

167
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,876
Then I asked to borrow her car.

168
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,239
And follow the rules of the road,
mister!

169
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,145
I will.

170
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:05,978
All right.

171
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,296
Hi, welcome to Burgerville.
You can order when you're ready.

172
00:18:53,999 --> 00:19:02,907
Uh... I'll have two cheeseburgers...
and... a chocolate shake.

173
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,604
Alex, I know you're bummed and all.

174
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,871
But this trip to Corvalis,
is gonna be like a sure thing for me.

175
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,846
Dude but that's weak,
you'd ditch Paranoid for some girl.

176
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,745
Especially when she was denying you
the whole summer.

177
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:50,753
Yeah but dude...
I'm gonna get so laid this time.

178
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,218
And you should call Jennifer, I mean,

179
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,292
what are you waiting for with her?
What do you want?

180
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,394
What I really wanted was to go skate

181
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,021
with the hardcore freaks
at Paranoid Park.

182
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,559
All right, dude,
you can crash at my place.

183
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,036
Play video games. Call Jennifer.
Then we'll both get laid.

184
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,970
I didn't want someone
to damage my mom's car,

185
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,704
so I parked on the other side
of the river,

186
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,439
which was a safer bet.

187
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:43,500
Hey, kid.

188
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:44,074
Hey.

189
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,335
Your mom know you're here?

190
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:46,205
Yeah.

191
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,471
Is she hot?

192
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:48,643
Dude, I don't know.

193
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,372
You should bring her by.

194
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:26,815
Paranoid was great.

195
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,216
I could have sat there all night
watching the skaters

196
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,982
and the girls and
all the stuff going on.

197
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,455
The only bad thing was...

198
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,789
I started thinking about other things,
like my parents.

199
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,027
Hello?

200
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,393
My dad had supposedly moved out.

201
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,932
But he kept calling the house,
bugging us.

202
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,626
And my mom was
not handling it well.

203
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,170
And my poor brother Henry,
he was thirteen,

204
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,037
and he would get so worried
about stuff he'd throw up his dinner.

205
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,767
Couldn't handle the stress at all.

206
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,543
I also thought about Jennifer.

207
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,542
She seemed pretty determined
for us to be together. I mean...

208
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,083
...worse things could happen.

209
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,919
I just wish I'd like her
more or we had more in common.

210
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,147
Hey kid!

211
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,593
Hey! You gonna ride
that skateboard or sit on it?

212
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,389
I'm waiting for someone.

213
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,601
Wo. What's up?
You gonna ride this thing, man?

214
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,067
I'm waiting for somebody.

215
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,364
You're not gonna let me ride it.

216
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,370
I'm waiting for someone.

217
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:27,638
You know there's dead bodies buried here
...under the cement?

218
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:28,473
Isn't that right?

219
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:29,773
Yeah, that's true.

220
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:30,711
Come on, tell you what.

221
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,407
Let me ride the board,
I don't come back,

222
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,644
you can have the little hottie
right here.

223
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,682
- All right.
- Isn't she cute?

224
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:43,159
Hey... I'm Paisley, and this is Jolt.

225
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,532
Hey, check out Scratch.

226
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:01,144
Sweet, thanks, man.
Told you I'd come back.

227
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:05,183
Yeah, no problem.
So where you guys live?

228
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,248
Right here, man.

229
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,614
At the skatepark?

230
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,688
- Pretty much.
- This is our fucking home!

231
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:11,914
How 'bout you?

232
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,088
With my mom.

233
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,327
You wanna ride a train, man?
You wanna get some beer?

234
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:17,888
All right.

235
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:18,859
How 'bout you guys?

236
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,396
We'll stay here, man.

237
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,858
He asked if I wanted to get some beer.

238
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,849
I didn't know about the beer,

239
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,129
but I really wanted to ride
a freight train.

240
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,193
Then later that night,
I drove back to Jared's.

241
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,860
I had to change out of my clothes,
they were so thrashed.

242
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,722
Say name and city, please.

243
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,189
Yeah, Tremain in Gearhart,
please.

244
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,389
Press one to be connected
at no additional fee.

245
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,395
Happy Citizenship Day.

246
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,537
So, how are things with your parents?

247
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,843
Not that good. It's official now,
they're gonna get a divorce.

248
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:15,505
That must be hard.

249
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,410
Yeah well, its out in the open.

250
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:21,808
I uh... heard about you and Jennifer.

251
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,922
Well, I think, everyone heard
about you and Jennifer. So...

252
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:25,715
Yeah...

253
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:26,846
That didn't last very long.

254
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:27,686
Naw, it didn't.

255
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,192
So... why'd you break up with her?

256
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,523
Why was I even going out with her,
you mean.

257
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,531
Yeah, that's what I mean, but,
you must have liked her a little?

258
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,692
Well, I liked her
a little last summer...

259
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,861
before she decided
I was her boyfriend.

260
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,500
Well with all the stuff
you're going through,

261
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,073
I guess something
like that could be hard.

262
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,676
Whatever. What?

263
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:49,313
Macy... you know there's just...
everybody's parents get divorced.

264
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:53,247
There's... other problems.
Bigger problems.

265
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,784
Like what?

266
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,448
Like... people dying in Iraq...
starving kids in Africa.

267
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,616
Since when do you care
about starving children in Africa?

268
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,955
Well, you know what I mean, just...
the little problems,

269
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,858
they're just all so stupid.

270
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,760
Not if it's happening to you.

271
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,862
Well... just all the stuff in general.

272
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:15,368
So... it seems like something
did happen to you.

273
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,032
No, you know what I mean, Macy.

274
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:22,139
Not really.
So, did something happen to you?

275
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:27,474
No... I just feel
like there's like something,

276
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:28,847
outside of normal life.

277
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:33,515
Outside of... teachers,
breakups, girlfriends...

278
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,819
Like, right out there.

279
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:42,194
Like, outside... there's like,
different levels... of stuff.

280
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,092
And... there's something
that happened to me.

281
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:46,203
I thought so.

282
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:27,372
Alex... Alex...

283
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,380
What, you just gonna walk right past me?

284
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,021
So, did you have fun
with Jared on Saturday?

285
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,222
Not really.

286
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:48,627
What'd you guys do?

287
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,233
Just hung out.

288
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,200
Well, I went swimming at Elizabeth's.
You should have come.

289
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,704
But, right, I guess that stuff doesn't
interest you anymore because,

290
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,637
skating with Jared is more fun.

291
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:58,308
But...

292
00:27:58,443 --> 00:27:59,876
Whatever, shut up.

293
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,743
So... what are you doing after school?

294
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,007
Nothing.

295
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,346
We could do something if you want.

296
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,149
OK.

297
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,953
Cool. So, you gonna walk me to my class?

298
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,023
OK.

299
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,191
Come out.

300
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,559
Don't laugh.

301
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,036
The pants are a little too big.

302
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,664
Oh, my god. OK, I think that's
your sexiest look yet, Alex.

303
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:36,577
I need to get smaller pants.
But does it look good?

304
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,873
It's um... it's interesting.

305
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,651
You should try something on.

306
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,455
OK... change. You change now.

307
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,849
Oh my god.

308
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,256
Does it fit you?

309
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,693
No, it's really big.
Look, the straps are like huge.

310
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:53,727
It looks good.

311
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:54,763
It's all like, huge.

312
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,991
Shall we?

313
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,560
Take this. Take your shirt.

314
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:03,672
Give me... I need my clothes!
Go, move... get out.

315
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:09,172
I need my dress!
Can I have my dress back? Thank you.

316
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,283
Get out! You can't be in here.
I... stop.

317
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,198
Dude, that's not your board.

318
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,732
Yeah it is, I just got it.

319
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,665
What'd you get a new board for?

320
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,869
Because I wanted
to try something different.

321
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,439
Why didn't you tell me about this?

322
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,269
Why would I tell you,
it's just a new board.

323
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:39,467
Dude because I gotta skate with you

324
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,045
and I can't have some fag board riding
next to me.

325
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,341
Wow, it's not even a fag board.
Just drive.

326
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:45,414
Yeah OK...

327
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:23,042
Mm mm. I got boogie buns...

328
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,283
Is... is that techno stuff?

329
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,602
Dude, we should go check out
Paranoid Park.

330
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,543
Dude, I don't think I'm ready
for Paranoid Park.

331
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:32,282
Yeah but no one's ever really ready
for Paranoid Park.

332
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,787
This is News Break,
I'm Ken Boddie.

333
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:43,553
Was it a horrible accident
or was it murder?

334
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,289
Police are investigating
a grisly scene

335
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,889
at the central train yard
near downtown Portland.

336
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,298
A security guard was found dead,

337
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:56,237
literally cut in half
by the wheels of a freight train.

338
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:59,036
Police say there is evidence
of foul play,

339
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:02,408
but they aren't releasing
any more details at this time.

340
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:06,347
And at this point,
there are no possible suspects.

341
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,885
We are following this case closely
and will have more tonight...

342
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,489
on KOIN News Six, at eleven.

343
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,995
I know, I woke up passed out laying
next to the vending machines.

344
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,864
I don't remember anything
that happened that night.

345
00:33:59,003 --> 00:33:59,901
Were you drinking?

346
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,405
Yeah. I have no idea what happened.

347
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,768
I thought this master plan
was supposed to work.

348
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,970
Hey you know why that kid's getting...
arrested?

349
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,672
Oh, yeah. He just got like caught
for pot or something.

350
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:13,477
I don't know. He's not gonna get
a fair trial, though.

351
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:19,652
That's my corndog, man.

352
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:20,189
I'm starving.

353
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:26,160
Will the following people please report
to the principal's office?

354
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:29,664
Jared Fitch, Christian Barlow,
Paul and Alex Tremain.

355
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:30,995
Did he just call my name?

356
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,329
Yeah.

357
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,040
Dude, all the skater kids
are getting called to the office, man.

358
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,122
OK, this is Detective Lu.

359
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,227
Hello... hello... Hey, Lu Lu.

360
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,334
Guys.

361
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:12,401
What are those cuffs for?

362
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:13,561
Handcuffs... handcuffs.

363
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:15,399
Hey... show him some respect, please.

364
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,905
Show me respect.

365
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:18,739
Respect my...

366
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:22,710
All right... Thank you, uh... Miss Adams.

367
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,549
Damn!

368
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,219
Check... What you looking at? Huh?

369
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,288
Anyway...

370
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,153
Like she said my name
is Detective Richard Lu.

371
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,487
You can, call me Rich.

372
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:39,459
Or Lu Lu.

373
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,189
And, so you know, my...

374
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,061
partner and I are here
to investigate a murder

375
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,295
that occurred downtown...
near a skateboard park.

376
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,233
So the police department
wants us to get in touch

377
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:53,503
and make some contacts with the...
skateboard community.

378
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:56,704
And hopefully you can help us solve a...
a case that we have here.

379
00:36:56,847 --> 00:37:01,580
So anyway... what I wanna do is uh...
talk to you guys and get to know ya.

380
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:02,810
Let's go ahead
and just go around the room...

381
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:03,716
I want to get to know you, too.

382
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,481
I want you to introduce yourselves.
Start here.

383
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:06,351
- I'm Paul Thrief.
- Paul.

384
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,320
Jeremy.

385
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,015
Eric.

386
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,091
- Christian.
- Christian.

387
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,387
- Cal.
- Cal.

388
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,620
Alex.

389
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,320
- Jared.
- Jared.

390
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:14,431
Jeremy.

391
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,554
Brian.

392
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,568
OK. Raise your hands...
if you've ever been,

393
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,535
to the Eastside Skateboard Park.

394
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,003
You know everybody's
gonna raise their hand...

395
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,698
But it's called Paranoid Park,
nobody calls it...

396
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,743
Paranoid. OK, so you all have.

397
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,505
OK, good, that's what I was hoping for.

398
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:34,141
Now of those who rose your hands,
who was there, at any time,

399
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:38,221
during the weekend of
September sixteenth, or seventeenth?

400
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,054
OK, um... Jared.

401
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:47,995
Yeah. Yeah, we uh...
Alex and I went there like...

402
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,726
that week... during the day, though.

403
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,597
During the week.
Do you remember what day that was?

404
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,171
Uh, I don't know. Tuesday maybe?

405
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:55,829
OK.

406
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,840
We actually planned to go there
that weekend but we didn't.

407
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,509
You didn't. So what did you do, then?

408
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,143
I went down to Oregon State.

409
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,145
OK, Corvalis. All right.

410
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,081
So... you went to OSU,
so you went to Paranoid Park?

411
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,015
No.

412
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,848
You did not. OK, where did you go?

413
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:14,219
I... I didn't want to go the park
by myself so... I didn't.

414
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,690
Yeah, no one wants to go
the Paranoid by themself, man.

415
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,055
That place is scary.

416
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:19,355
- I always go there.
- Yeah, true.

417
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,694
They only mess if you make
a mess with them. I always go there.

418
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,994
Man, whatever. I'm just
saying it has like a reputation.

419
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:27,998
OK, all right. I understand that.

420
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:30,365
Let's... let's get started here...

421
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,373
Hey, what exactly
are you accusing us of?

422
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,338
Well, I'm not accusing you of anything,
nothing at all.

423
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,275
I mean... this is not about suspects.

424
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:41,716
In fact, just so we're clear,
nobody here in this room is a suspect.

425
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,251
In fact if you were a suspect,

426
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,753
we'd be treating you a little
differently than we are today, OK?

427
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,858
What it is, is that I'm trying to learn,

428
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:52,224
and get some background from you guys
about your skateboard... community.

429
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,661
It's not like a community.
It's not like we know each other.

430
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:55,823
Well, I understand that.

431
00:38:55,966 --> 00:39:00,130
In fact... let me flip this around,
let me give you some background here.

432
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:04,833
What we have,
is a... possible murder situation.

433
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:06,306
Will you hand that out for me?

434
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,703
Take a look at these pictures
and you can understand why we're here.

435
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:16,980
Aw, dude! Let me see.

436
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,551
Oh sh... shit...

437
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,624
Gentlemen, that's the real deal there.

438
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,892
It's like part of his clothes is
on the bar...

439
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,828
Now the deceased there was found on
the railroad tracks just outside of

440
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:33,562
the central train yard...
over by downtown.

441
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,969
Now the train that was involved
in this thing here you're looking at...

442
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:41,038
just before it got to that yard it,
went by...

443
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,442
the Eastside Skateboard Park.

444
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:44,377
- Eastside...
- So?

445
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:45,447
Eastside!?

446
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,675
It's called Paranoid Park here, man.

447
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:49,684
Well... exactly.
And... and you know what?

448
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,782
We think it's possible,
if this is a murder... situation,

449
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:59,021
that somebody from... Paranoid Park...
was involved with this.

450
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,152
So you think a skateboarder did it?

451
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,497
Check out that.

452
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,560
I had tried to put this part out
of my mind.

453
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,601
But Lu's picture
brought it all back.

454
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:20,172
This was my chance to take a moment,
to think for a second,

455
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,142
to figure out the best thing to do.

456
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:16,923
Woo!

457
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,143
Pretty cool, huh?

458
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:30,139
Next time you ride a train get
on in the same spot.

459
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:34,974
It's safer there.
If you lose your grip and you swing off,

460
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,553
you'll just hit the side
and bounce back in.

461
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:41,956
If you're riding here and you fall off,
you're gonna go right under there.

462
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,463
Woo! You like this man,
you diggin' it?

463
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,881
Oh quick, man, hide! Hide hide hide.
Hide, man, hide hide!

464
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,294
He was trying to kill us.
He had a lead bat.

465
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:34,397
Why... why can't
you just understand that...

466
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:37,390
God... you know...

467
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:38,626
Call the police.

468
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,236
It's OK, Alex,
you're not gonna get in trouble.

469
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,632
Call home...

470
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,564
Call Someone.
It was self-defense.

471
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,232
I thought about my skateboard...

472
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,807
People defend themselves all the time.

473
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:53,246
But never mind that...
I had to tell someone.

474
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,613
Maybe that was the thing...
It's OK, Alex.

475
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,982
You're not gonna get in trouble.
It's OK.

476
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:00,056
Get a lawyer first...
then call the police.

477
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:02,715
That's what sports people did...

478
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:07,127
Just calm down, Alex.
...Didn't it?

479
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:12,734
My brain could have debates
all night long.

480
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:13,768
My body didn't care.

481
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,805
My body wanted only one thing,
to get the hell out of there.

482
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:21,605
Oh my god!

483
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,043
Oh my god!

484
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:47,335
I was so screwed.
What was I going to do?

485
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:50,065
I shouldn't waste time.
I needed to talk to someone.

486
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,902
I needed to take an action
and get this weight off me.

487
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,006
My dad, that was the person to talk to.

488
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:59,547
I knew where he was,
at my Uncle Tommy's.

489
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,709
I could already feel the relief
of telling him.

490
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:14,427
Say name and city, please.

491
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:16,998
Yeah, Tremain in Gearhart,
please.

492
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:21,130
Press one to be connected
at no additional fee.

493
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,136
Happy Citizenship Day.

494
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:19,644
Hey, honey.
What are you doing home so early?

495
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,723
We didn't go the Expo, Jared got sick.

496
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:22,825
What did he get sick with?

497
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:24,119
Not sure.

498
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:51,483
Honey?

499
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:54,752
Hey, honey?

500
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:55,448
What?

501
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,389
Uh, Uncle Tommy called earlier.

502
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:00,496
He said he got a call at the beach,
on his caller ID.

503
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,756
He did?

504
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:04,366
Yeah, he said the call was
from the Fitch's, and...

505
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:06,401
he asked me if I e...
knew anyone of that name

506
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:08,731
and I told him that's
where you were staying.

507
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,265
Oh.

508
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:13,439
Did you call Uncle Tommy's?

509
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,805
Yeah, maybe by accident.

510
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:18,845
Well he said the call was
at 4:35 in the morning.

511
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,580
That's weird.

512
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,078
Were you still awake then?

513
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:29,049
N... no... But... then again,
I was trying to call Ryan...

514
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:34,095
but... I could have been half asleep or,
even sleepwalking. Hm.

515
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:36,790
Oh.

516
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:37,730
Yeah.

517
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:43,402
So I have no clue.

518
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:46,666
OK.

519
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,848
I'm going to the mall
to check out some snowboards...

520
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:58,783
since I didn't go to the Expo.

521
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:02,449
Oh, OK. Well that's all right with me.
Uh, hey, where's your skateboard?

522
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,059
Oh, I left it at Jared's.

523
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:05,490
OK.

524
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:30,009
Morning, how are you doing?

525
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:30,778
Good.

526
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,682
What can I get you?

527
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,550
Uh, I'll just get a glass of water,
is that cool?

528
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,248
Yeah. I'll leave this here
if you change your mind.

529
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,689
Thanks. All right.

530
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,768
Hey. What are you doing here
so early?

531
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,134
Nothing.

532
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,877
Really? Looks like you're...
reading the news.

533
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:56,273
Yeah I'm just reading the newspaper.

534
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,347
Oh. Anything in there about the war?

535
00:56:58,448 --> 00:56:59,346
Nope.

536
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:00,949
Just checkin' out the sports.

537
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,747
In the Metro? Yeah...

538
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:38,514
In the Metro? Yeah...

539
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:39,650
Hey, Rachel.

540
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:40,915
Hey, Alex.

541
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:45,422
So uh... so that's why you came,
just to read the newspaper?

542
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:47,826
I was just bored so I came to the mall.

543
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,793
I just wondered. Yeah...

544
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:53,995
Well, we're gonna go see a movie.
You wanna... come with us?

545
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,069
No, thanks, I'm good.

546
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:57,730
Rather sit here and...
pretend to look at sports?

547
00:57:57,874 --> 00:57:59,136
Yeah, sports section.

548
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:02,608
OK, um... Yeah,
I guess I'll talk to you later, then.

549
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:03,143
OK.

550
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:04,610
So... yeah. Bye.

551
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:05,543
See ya.

552
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,314
That's a good one.

553
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:56,723
Thanks.

554
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:01,287
No no no...

555
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:06,867
- What...?
- You put a mirror in the...

556
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:08,231
How? It doesn't make sense...

557
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:09,861
I don't know, you...
you throw it down there...

558
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:10,700
Why would that...

559
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:11,829
...look at yourself?

560
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:12,532
Yeah, how would you...

561
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,142
But it'd be all mucky,
you won't be able to see.

562
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,904
I don't know, Gabe told it to me.
I didn't get it.

563
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:17,171
That's a terrible joke...

564
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:19,606
I mean, Alex...

565
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:21,143
Alex. Alex...

566
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,444
Awkward...

567
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:24,780
- Awkward.
- As in Alex.

568
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:26,953
That... that just...

569
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:24,970
Do you think we should do it again?

570
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:27,139
Or... maybe we should wait.

571
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,377
You know, we're gonna need more condoms.

572
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,140
We should go to Rite Aid and get 'em.

573
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:36,783
That's where um...
Pauline and George get theirs.

574
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,177
Yes, we totally did it.

575
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,303
Oh my god, I know right?

576
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,443
No, it was fantastic.

577
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:10,117
OK, OK, I gotta go. All right.

578
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:11,914
Do you think Lu knows
more than he's telling us?

579
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:13,146
Like what?

580
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,623
I don't know, like he's...
trying to trick us or something.

581
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:17,953
That's what detectives do.

582
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:20,119
No dude, don't be paranoid.
Why even worry about it?

583
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,525
I mean, he like, doesn't know anything.

584
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:23,154
He just like acting like he does.

585
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,062
Yeah, but that was pretty weird, though.

586
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:28,659
The detective coming to the school,
and only talking to skateboarders?

587
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:29,169
Yeah...

588
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:32,172
Dude, cops are like that.
I mean, why do you think they're cops?

589
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,299
They get paid less than a janitor.

590
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:37,540
Yeah, but I mean they do it
for other reasons.

591
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,639
Like what? Grownups do stuff for money.
There is no other reasons.

592
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:47,918
Cops do shit like that.
Just random shit.

593
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:13,941
Hey babe.

594
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:14,742
Hey.

595
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:16,249
Did you get the condoms yet?

596
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:17,283
Nope.

597
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:19,581
Do you wann get 'em, after school?

598
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:21,052
Maybe.

599
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:23,887
What's the matter? Are you mad?

600
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,152
No.

601
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:28,296
Well, you sure do act weird sometimes,

602
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:31,229
because you'd think after what we did
you'd be a little more happy to see me.

603
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,334
It was your idea.

604
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:35,035
What?! What is that supposed to mean?

605
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:36,138
Nothing.

606
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:40,402
So having sex was my idea.
You didn't want to. You just went along.

607
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,840
No, I'm just saying.

608
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:45,175
You were the one that,
wanted to get the condoms, so...

609
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:47,145
I thought we'd get 'em together.

610
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:50,979
Oh. OK, sorry.

611
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,712
I thought you were
talking about something else.

612
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:54,083
No, that's all I meant.

613
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:56,521
OK, well, we'll do that.

614
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:33,620
Hey, Alex.

615
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:34,889
Hey, Dad.

616
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:49,474
Oh, shit, wondered where this was.

617
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,102
Are you gonna take that?

618
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,013
I'm just gonna borrow it.

619
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:56,277
Your Uncle Tommy and I are going up
to the lake this weekend.

620
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:05,824
Do you need this?

621
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,623
Yeah... thanks.

622
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:10,699
Look I wanted to talk to you,

623
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:14,394
I don't... I don't know
what you've heard or...

624
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:15,595
what your mother's been telling ya.

625
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:20,300
Um... but I'm probably
not gonna be comin' around here anymore.

626
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,644
Um, we're still working
on the details, logistics and,

627
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:27,442
you know, trying to figure out
what's best for... for you and Henry.

628
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:33,350
Uh, working with your mother is...
not the easiest thing in the world...

629
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:34,979
as I'm sure you know.

630
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,456
But if there's any special
considerations that you have...

631
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:41,256
um... be sure and let me know.

632
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,597
How's school going,
how are your classes?

633
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:48,801
School's good.

634
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:51,170
How are Parker and those guys?

635
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,902
They're fine.

636
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,700
I saw Parker's dad the other night
at Outdoor World.

637
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:56,869
Yeah?

638
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:57,875
Yeah...

639
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,884
Are you still skateboarding?

640
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,679
Yeah, a little.

641
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:08,021
Right on.

642
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:13,190
Well, listen, I should be uh...
getting' my homework done, so...

643
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:14,557
Look I...

644
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:18,362
I just want you to know that...

645
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:22,160
I feel horrible
about this whole situation.

646
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:26,400
I never, never in a million years wanted
anything like this to happen.

647
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:31,012
If there's anything, anything
that I can do to make it easier for you

648
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:34,006
...please, let me know.

649
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:35,378
I know how you feel, Dad.

650
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,760
Jennifer! Jennifer.

651
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:39,241
I can't believe you.

652
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,679
You think you can break up
with me after we had sex.

653
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:02,498
Why would you give up free sex?
She was even hot.

654
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:06,800
Yeah dude, hope you have a backup,
or somethin'.

655
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:11,212
Dude, her and her friends
were just drama.

656
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:14,816
Dude, I don't know
what you're talking about. You're crazy.

657
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,385
Dude, I didn't like her either.

658
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:20,113
But getting laid is always better
than not getting laid.

659
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:21,154
Yeah, man.

660
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:22,415
True that.

661
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:23,756
How's it going?

662
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:27,124
Good. Do you guys have,
caramel cappuccinos?

663
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:29,857
No, we don't have caramel cappuccinos.

664
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:30,431
Damn. Do you guys...?

665
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:32,158
That's only... that's only Starbucks.

666
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:35,463
Robin, can I get a slice of pie?

667
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:36,468
Mm hm.

668
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,231
This looks really good.

669
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:42,572
Hey, guys. Need a coffee.
Say that again.

670
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:55,723
Let me pick this up actually.

671
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:58,491
Coffee.

672
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:16,501
You remember... you remember Tina...
the llama?

673
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:17,507
I think so.

674
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:20,774
"Tina, you fat lard,
come get some dinner!"

675
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:26,047
And uh, remember he's at school,
the chapstick part?

676
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:28,985
He's like, with the nurse he's like...
he's like,

677
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:30,682
"Can I use the phone?"

678
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:31,487
"Why?"

679
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,754
"'Cause I don't feel good!"

680
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:37,159
And, he uses the phone...
he... and it's his...

681
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:39,891
brother Kip, he's kind of a wuss.

682
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:43,630
He's like, he's like, he's like,
um, "I... is Grandma there?"

683
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:47,868
He's like, "No Napolean..."
"Can I... Well, where is she?"

684
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:49,671
"At the dunes."

685
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:52,440
"Since when does Grandma
go to the dunes?"

686
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,572
"I don't know,
she's with her boyfriend.

687
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:56,582
"He's like, "What?"
And he's like,

688
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,710
"Can you at least bring me
my chapstick?"

689
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:00,754
He's like, "No, Napolean.

690
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:04,222
"He's like, "God!" And then... he says,

691
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,521
"Come on, just...
just borrow some from the nurse,

692
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:09,130
she has like fifty sticks
in her drawer."

693
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:09,822
And he's like,

694
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:13,366
"Ew, I'm not gonna use nurse chapstick,
you sicko!"

695
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:16,232
And then he hangs up. And then, um...

696
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:17,600
We should be out now, dude.

697
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:18,399
What are you talking about?

698
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,303
- The war... Iraq...
- no

699
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:21,306
Oh.

700
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:22,307
What do you think?

701
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:24,002
I really don't care.

702
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,612
Geez... that's the kind of thing
that's wrong

703
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:28,808
with people today. Apathy...

704
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:29,781
What?

705
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:31,215
Oh, not caring.

706
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,378
I don't really know much about the war.

707
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:36,082
Figure it out, dude. Read the newspaper.

708
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:39,217
I hate... reading the newspaper
about the war.

709
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:41,893
OK, I'll never...

710
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:12,218
Hello? Hello?

711
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:14,088
Bad...

712
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:15,924
Why are you lying in the middle
of the driveway?

713
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:17,498
Because...

714
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,724
Is it fun down there?

715
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:22,202
You know what, just push me.

716
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,795
Wait wait wait. What about your face?

717
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:28,269
Just go. Pedal.

718
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:29,674
Hold on a sec.

719
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:00,573
I have the answer.

720
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:01,607
To what?

721
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,507
Like when you were saying...
if something happened,

722
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:05,169
to you and you couldn't tell anyone.

723
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,043
It doesn't matter, just forget it.

724
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:10,643
See, what I would do is...
I'd write a letter.

725
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:11,742
To who?

726
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,411
The person you did it to.
Like, an apology or whatever.

727
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:17,024
Or... maybe to someone else,
like a separate person.

728
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,184
But the point is,
to get it down and off your chest.

729
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:21,296
And then, you can stop stressing.

730
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:24,763
And, what am I supposed to do
with the letter... after?

731
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:28,667
Doesn't matter, like, save it,
send it, burn it, you know?

732
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:30,431
Th... writing it down
is the important thing.

733
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,905
So... yeah. I mean, once you get it out
there you'll feel way better.

734
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:35,168
It's a big relief.

735
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:38,370
I don't know, Macy, it sounds like
a homework assignment or something.

736
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:40,709
Trust me, it's
not a homework assignment.

737
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:44,307
You know...
it just feels good to have it all out.

738
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,952
Yeah... maybe.

739
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:51,018
But, the trick is... write it
to someone you can really talk to,

740
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,388
like someone you're comfortable with.

741
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:54,860
Not your parents or your teachers
or whatever.

742
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:56,259
Write it to a friend.

743
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:57,524
Yeah.

744
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:59,664
Write it to me.

745
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:15,643
OK, Macy. It's late now.
I'm gonna stop.

746
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:35,285
All right, we're gonna follow up
on yesterday's field study

747
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,824
and we're gonna
look at the macro-invertebrates.

748
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:40,127
We're gonna look at the tolerant group
and the...

749
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:40,728
intolerant group...

750
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:44,354
And let's put a... drop of uh,
pond water on it.

751
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:49,296
And let's classify...
micro-invertebrates.

752
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:52,963
Alex?
