we fought last night.

327
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:20,204
You passed your test
with flying colors.

328
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,373
Test? What test?

329
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,511
Your hairy little friend
knows me as oroku saki,

330
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,147
but you may call me...

331
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:32,182
The shredder.

332
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,484
A kitchen utensil?

333
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:36,186
You would be wise to
lose your flippant ways

334
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:39,156
if you wish to join
the honorable foot clan.

335
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:41,558
Why should we
want to do that?

336
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:44,194
Because it was I
who made you

337
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:45,962
what you are today.

338
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,864
If not for me,

339
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:51,234
hamato yoshi would never
have left Japan.

340
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,236
I followed him
to this country,

341
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,406
where I gained
my advanced technology,

342
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:59,242
including my rare
experimental mutagen.

343
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,679
It was I who caused you
to mutate

344
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:03,246
into your humanoid form.

345
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,882
You owe everything to me!

346
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,721
Don't deny your destiny.
Join me.

347
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:13,891
Does the phrase
"go suck a lemon"

348
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,592
hold any meaning
for you?

349
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,394
Let's cut
him down!

350
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:21,031
Very well.
I have my own mutants.

351
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:22,432
Bebop...

352
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,100
Rock steady...

353
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,669
Destroy them!

354
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:26,836
Grrr.

355
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:30,073
With great pleasure,
master shredder.

356
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:32,042
Grrr!

357
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:33,577
Arr!

358
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:34,745
Jump for it!

359
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,582
You idiots!

360
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,185
The mutation didn't
up their iqs any.

361
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:02,806
Come on, splinter.

We're checking out

Come on,
you fools.

364
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:12,682
I just hope I haven't
missed out on the action!

365
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,461
Rest here a moment,
master.

366
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:26,764
You know, that was
almost too easy.

367
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:29,199
I really wish you'd stop
saying things like that.

368
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:36,506
Rarrr!

369
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:39,143
Say your prayers,

aw, this is ridiculous.

374

We're never gonna
stop those guys.

375
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:10,406
Yeah, those jerks
belong in a zoo,

376
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:12,009
not the streets.

377
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:14,511

that's a brilliant notion.

378

Sorry. We'll have to take
a rain check on that.

where's the action?

you could get a shot

Where'd those guys
come from?
