1
00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:22,217
HITMAN: You gotta know what
you're doing when you go in.

2
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:25,007
You gotta have
it figured out.

3
00:00:27,315 --> 00:00:28,297
Those are the rules.

4
00:00:36,852 --> 00:00:39,569
How you get in,
how you get out,

5
00:00:39,603 --> 00:00:41,359
how many shots
you're gonna need.

6
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,940
Make sure you know
where everybody is.

7
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:48,080
Make sure nobody sees you.

8
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,808
Don't hang around.

9
00:00:53,843 --> 00:00:56,232
Don't get interested.

10
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:58,163
Then you
don't make mistakes.

11
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:16,011
[Phone ringing]

12
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:34,570
[Ringing]

13
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:43,978
Yeah.

14
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:45,197
MAN: How'd you like
to go to Detroit

15
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:47,569
and see a man in a hotel
Friday morning?

16
00:01:48,883 --> 00:01:50,444
HITMAN:
I don't do that anymore.

17
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:53,545
MAN: I'll double your price.

18
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:55,497
You can do
whatever you want.

19
00:01:57,555 --> 00:01:59,857
Can't hear you, chief.

20
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:01,833
I'm taking it
this guy in the hotel

21
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,264
is somebody you don't want
to look in the face.

22
00:02:05,684 --> 00:02:07,375
I'm thinking maybe
it's the old man

23
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:10,346
with the big house
you want to move into.

24
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:12,973
Guy past his time,

25
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:14,703
and he don't like
how you do things.

26
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:16,365
Hey, fuck you.
I'll get somebody else.

27
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,054
You don't have
no somebody else.

28
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:21,993
You call me when your people
won't do it.

29
00:02:22,035 --> 00:02:23,497
MAN: You want to leave it
all behind, chief,

30
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:25,197
here's your chance.

31
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:32,845
You have a Cadillac...
a blue one.

32
00:02:32,883 --> 00:02:33,832
MAN: Yeah.

33
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:36,362
HITMAN:
Throw that in there,

34
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:37,713
you'll never see me
again.

35
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,121
MAN: You can collect your money
next Tuesday.

36
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:44,651
Union Station, usual place.

37
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:46,285
He'll have a girl with him.

38
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:47,533
She'll let you in.

39
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:13,515
HITMAN: Papa.

40
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,306
OLD MAN: Yeah?

41
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:17,713
You got somethin' for me?

42
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:20,554
HITMAN:
From your son-in-law.

43
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:24,716
OLD MAN: Oh, Christ.

44
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:29,002
I told my daughter,
"Don't marry that punk."

45
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:30,636
She don't listen.

46
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:32,813
I give him six months.

47
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:34,826
There'll be another funeral.

48
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:36,209
You want him done
sooner than that,

49
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:37,421
you tell me.

50
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:40,206
Who the hell are you?

51
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:41,869
You don't remember?

52
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:43,216
Should I?

53
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:45,641
You know
Walpole Island, Papa?

54
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,893
It's an Indian reserve.

55
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:49,037
My grandmother lives there.

56
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:50,733
She's a medicine woman.

57
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,601
She was going to turn me
into an owl one time.

58
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:57,491
I told her,
"I don't want to be no owl.

59
00:03:57,523 --> 00:03:59,760
I want to be a blackbird."

60
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:01,737
That's how I got my name.

61
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:03,689
Blackbird.

62
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:04,844
You remember now.

63
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:06,705
The Degas brothers,

64
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,016
one killed working for you,

65
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:10,440
shot dead in the hospital,

66
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,818
the other one doing life
in Kingston.

67
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:14,510
I'm the only one left.

68
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:19,688
Huh.

69
00:04:20,948 --> 00:04:22,922
Can she do that?

70
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:24,654
Turn you into an owl?

71
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:26,763
If she want to.

72
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:29,422
I could use
a woman like that.

73
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:42,417
I'd like to be dressed.

74
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:44,012
Is that okay with you?

75
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:46,578
Whatever you want.

76
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:18,192
WOMAN: Are you through?

77
00:05:18,227 --> 00:05:19,176
Not yet.

78
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:23,920
# My, my #

79
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:28,013
# Little white lies #

80
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:32,361
# Swear I'm gonna
make it right #

81
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:35,665
# This time #

82
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,758
# Start the radio #

83
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:43,789
# Turn it way down low #

84
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:48,529
# Tellin' me things
I do not know #

85
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:51,378
# I know #

86
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:56,780
And it could be used equally
as a recreation room or a den.

87
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,063
WOMAN BUYER:
Look in here, Dan.

88
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:00,434
AGENT: Quite a lovely,
distinctive entrance hall,

89
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:04,428
which is so practical
and elegant, don't you think?

90
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:05,777
Thank you.

91
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:22,799
# Now who's to blame? #

92
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:24,777
# You used to be the same #

93
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,470
MAN: Wayne! Foreman!

94
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:31,337
WAYNE: What?!

95
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:33,484
What?!

96
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,359
# It's a suicide #

97
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:39,053
MAN: And don't bother
comin' back!

98
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:42,058
# Shut up and drive #

99
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:46,162
RICHIE: Mrs. Palino.

100
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:47,821
Richie Nix.

101
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:50,707
You were my foster mom
for a while.

102
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:52,910
I had a collection
of old Elvis vinyls

103
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:54,441
I left here a while back.

104
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:56,818
My girlfriend,
she's a big Elvis fan.

105
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:57,898
We thought we'd come by
and, uh,

106
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,019
pick 'em up from you.

107
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:02,834
Last time I saw you,
you drove off in my car.

108
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:06,096
Go fuck off
before I call the police.

109
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:10,445
# Tonight you will be mine #

110
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:11,563
WOMAN: It's okay.

111
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:20,402
# Tonight the monkey dies #

112
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:43,274
# Tonight you will be mine #

113
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:48,017
# Tonight the monkey dies #

114
00:08:09,395 --> 00:08:12,242
If you're lookin' for
your grandmother, she's gone.

115
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:15,177
We buried her last winter.

116
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:33,200
WAYNE: Gonna spend
a few weeks huntin' deer.

117
00:08:33,235 --> 00:08:36,366
LIONEL: Be sure and pour
some of this stuff on ya.

118
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:37,516
Here.

119
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:39,082
Thanks.

120
00:08:39,123 --> 00:08:40,781
Wayne?

121
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:41,833
Yeah?

122
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,631
You lookin'
for another job?

123
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:44,616
I don't know.

124
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:45,968
Try my hand
at real estate maybe.

125
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:48,687
Put you in an office
and a suit.

126
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:49,901
Ha ha! You bet!

127
00:08:57,363 --> 00:08:59,534
Hey, Lionel.

128
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:00,815
Where's your cane?

129
00:09:03,155 --> 00:09:05,227
I'm sorry
about your grandmother.

130
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:08,528
The band office
has been trying to locate

131
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:09,807
the next of kin

132
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:11,916
to find out what to do
with her house.

133
00:09:11,955 --> 00:09:13,515
Hey, I been thinking.

134
00:09:15,283 --> 00:09:17,771
When I get paid
for this job I done,

135
00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:19,950
maybe I could fix
the place up.

136
00:09:19,987 --> 00:09:21,776
You could sell it
the way it is.

137
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,600
No, I mean fix it up
and live here.

138
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:26,479
A guy like you,

139
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:28,009
used to living
in the city?

140
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:30,385
There's no life
for you here.

141
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:35,122
I could always be
a friendly Indian like you,

142
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:36,497
maybe even a guide.

143
00:09:37,683 --> 00:09:39,309
You wouldn't like it.

144
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:41,070
Why not? You do.

145
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:43,246
Hey, Lionel,

146
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,810
come on, you telling me
I can't live here?

147
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:50,730
Hey, you ever ride
in a Cadillac?

148
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:52,560
Come on. We'll take a drive.

149
00:09:52,595 --> 00:09:54,505
Go to Algonac,
have some drink.

150
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,805
You go.

151
00:09:57,843 --> 00:09:59,599
I got to go home.

152
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:17,967
WAYNE: Hey.

153
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:18,896
Hi.

154
00:10:18,963 --> 00:10:21,549
WAYNE: Didn't let myself in.

155
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:23,506
Right.

156
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,513
Which is kind of weird.

157
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:38,380
CARMEN: Well,
I made a start.

158
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:41,875
I thought I'd leave
the hunting things for you.

159
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:45,100
Okay.

160
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,484
CARMEN: Well, the guns
I understand,

161
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:55,694
but why the suit?

162
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:57,771
You gonna rob a bank?

163
00:10:57,811 --> 00:10:59,534
You mind if I leave
some of this stuff here

164
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:01,611
till next time?

165
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:03,756
What's this?

166
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:04,743
Buck lure.

167
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:09,584
Oh! God,

00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:08,459
the number one agency
in the Anchor Bay area,

328
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:11,345
serving the whole community
with expertise and integrity

329
00:21:11,378 --> 00:21:13,833
for more than 15 years.

330
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:17,807
RICHIE: You own this business,
you still drive a pickup?

331
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:20,525
WAYNE: I like to think success
hasn't changed me.

332
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,116
CARMEN: Wayne?

333
00:21:23,154 --> 00:21:24,496
RICHIE: Who the fuck
is Wayne?

334
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,057
WAYNE: Beats me.

335
00:21:27,891 --> 00:21:29,385
BLACKBIRD: Hey, let's go.

336
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:30,670
CARMEN: Wayne?

337
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,688
RICHIE:
What's goin' on here?

338
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:33,934
Hey, forget it.
Let's get out.

339
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,214
No. Give it to me.

340
00:21:45,682 --> 00:21:47,307
Lock the door. Call the cops.

341
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:14,124
Aah!

342
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,377
Hey!

343
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:33,640
Hey!

344
00:22:36,307 --> 00:22:39,470
Bird!

345
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,054
Fuck!

346
00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:02,636
WAYNE: For a job.

347
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:06,157
I said Nelson knew
I was comin' by.

348
00:23:06,194 --> 00:23:07,274
It was hardly an appointment.

349
00:23:07,314 --> 00:23:08,808
His wife's an employee,

350
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,344
and there was some talk
about Wayne dropping by.

351
00:23:10,386 --> 00:23:11,695
Hence, the suit.

352
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,678
But you're an ironworker.

353
00:23:12,722 --> 00:23:14,283
Hence, the boots.

354
00:23:14,322 --> 00:23:16,744
I'm lookin'
at other things, okay?

355
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:18,760
NELSON: It's just an odd time
to appear, that's all.

356
00:23:18,802 --> 00:23:20,209
Lunch. There's nobody here.

357
00:23:20,242 --> 00:23:21,452
I was here.

358
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,465
Because I'm gonna be
making some claims, all right?

359
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:25,099
The window damages...

360
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:26,600
OFFICER: And you didn't know
these guys?

361
00:23:26,642 --> 00:23:27,787
No, sir.

362
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:30,281
'Cause nobody witnessed
you arriving separately.

363
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:32,264
CARMEN: Wait just a minute.

364
00:23:32,306 --> 00:23:33,648
They shot at my husband.

365
00:23:33,682 --> 00:23:35,406
He probably saved my life.

366
00:23:35,442 --> 00:23:38,192
Mr. Colson, you knew nothing
about these blackmail calls?

367
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:40,113
Hey, I don't know
about any calls.

368
00:23:40,146 --> 00:23:41,128
What blackmail calls?

369
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:45,615
There were some calls
last week. Uh, creeps.

370
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,690
I told the police.

371
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,224
But not us?

372
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:51,754
Those creeps
had guns, Nelson.

373
00:23:51,794 --> 00:23:52,971
WAYNE: Asshole.

374
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,122
Wayne.

375
00:23:55,218 --> 00:23:56,495
CARMEN: Asshole.

376
00:24:01,586 --> 00:24:03,626
RICHIE: I'm bleedin'
somethin' fierce here, man.

377
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,706
Let's just go to Marine City.
I want to see Donna.

378
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:07,502
Who the fuck is Donna?

379
00:24:07,538 --> 00:24:09,164
She's this woman
that I'm stayin' with.

380
00:24:09,202 --> 00:24:11,275
She's cool, man.
I told her about you.

381
00:24:11,314 --> 00:24:13,965
It's on the way
to Port Huron.

382
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:16,107
My brothers and I
come up here one time

383
00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:17,292
to kill a guy.

384
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,330
No shit. What'd he do?

385
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,647
I didn't ask.

386
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:26,761
That doesn't
make sense to me.

387
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:29,519
I gotta be pissed at a guy
I want to kill him.

388
00:24:30,866 --> 00:24:32,491
Bird, why didn't you shoot him?

389
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,504
He was standin' right there
in the fuckin' window.

390
00:24:34,546 --> 00:24:36,072
You want to learn somethin'?

391
00:24:36,114 --> 00:24:38,503
The only time
you ever take out your gun

392
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:40,007
is when you're gonna
kill somebody.

393
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,904
Yeah? Well,
you could've right there!

394
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,825
It's the same as a hunter.

395
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:45,549
The guy who knows
what he's doing,

396
00:24:45,586 --> 00:24:49,416
he don't take the shot
if he thinks he can miss.

397
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:52,807
See, then you gotta find
the animal and finish it,

398
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:53,962
two of them.

399
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:56,655
Are you talkin'
about the woman now?

400
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,697
What'd that woman do?

401
00:24:58,738 --> 00:25:01,194
She saw my face.

402
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:03,143
You don't
ever leave things undone.

403
00:25:03,186 --> 00:25:04,201
You don't ever think

404
00:25:04,242 --> 00:25:06,446
somebody's not going
to remember you.

405
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,814
LIONEL: Some people were askin'
after you this mornin'.

406
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,443
BLACKBIRD: What people?

407
00:25:22,482 --> 00:25:26,127
Said they were friends
of yours from Toronto.

408
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:28,333
What'd you tell them?

409
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:31,686
I told them
I hadn't seen you in years.

410
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,578
You see
my friend's face, Lionel?

411
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,269
Fell off a ladder.

412
00:25:36,306 --> 00:25:38,193
Got cut up,
couldn't go to work.

413
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:41,575
So I said, "Hey,
let's go duck hunting."

414
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:43,244
You free to take us?

415
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:47,688
Weather's supposed to turn.

416
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,934
Why don't we go anyway?

417
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,075
Richie's never seen
a marsh before.

418
00:25:52,114 --> 00:25:53,575
I've seen a marsh.

419
00:25:57,746 --> 00:25:59,273
Come on, Lionel.

420
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:02,663
This won't take long.

421
00:26:22,194 --> 00:26:23,721
You okay?

422
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:26,250
I... guess so.

423
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,395
That Indian guy freaked me out.

424
00:26:28,434 --> 00:26:29,644
Walk you in?

425
00:26:31,538 --> 00:26:33,000
CARMEN: So what things
are you looking at?

426
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:34,024
WAYNE: Huh?

427
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,081
Back there with the police,

428
00:26:35,122 --> 00:26:37,293
you said you were
looking at other things?

429
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:40,177
Yeah, well,
I'm lookin' at anything.

430
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,032
You said it.
I'm a dinosaur.

431
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:43,627
I gotta change or die.

432
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:45,226
I never said that.

433
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:47,153
Then I'm sayin' it.

434
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:49,607
So today's the day
you decide to come in

435
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:50,926
about a job in real estate?

436
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,294
What? I could sell a house.

437
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,534
Absolutely.

438
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,220
Anyway, thank God
you showed up in that suit.

439
00:26:58,258 --> 00:27:00,560
Yeah, dangerous suit.

440
00:27:00,594 --> 00:27:02,449
Got married in it,
got shot at in it.

441
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:04,816
Well, you look great in it.

442
00:27:06,514 --> 00:27:08,685
Anyway, thanks.

443
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:11,082
Anytime.

444
00:27:16,881 --> 00:27:17,830
Wayne?

445
00:27:21,714 --> 00:27:23,241
It's a deer.

446
00:27:23,282 --> 00:27:25,486
Get some rest.

447
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:28,140
You need anything,
just call the Hillcrest Motel.

448
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,177
RICHIE:
I don't see any birds.

449
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:40,941
LIONEL:
You want to hunt ducks?

450
00:27:40,978 --> 00:27:43,150
You watch the sky.

451
00:27:45,778 --> 00:27:48,812
It looks different,
all this water.

452
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,825
LIONEL: Maybe you never
came down this far,

453
00:27:50,866 --> 00:27:52,622
you and your brothers.

454
00:27:52,657 --> 00:27:56,040
There are no cats or dogs
around here to shoot.

455
00:27:57,938 --> 00:28:01,004
Last time I saw you,
you were going hunting

456
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:05,165
with some guy
in a ironworker's jacket.

457
00:28:05,202 --> 00:28:07,503
Seemed like a nice guy.

458
00:28:07,538 --> 00:28:09,480
What was his name?

459
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:11,818
Carl.

460
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,800
Wayne.

461
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:15,532
You can't remember the rest,

462
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,287
we'll go back and ask
your wife and daughter.

463
00:28:22,098 --> 00:28:23,724
Wayne Colson.

464
00:28:23,762 --> 00:28:25,136
Where does he live?

465
00:28:26,098 --> 00:28:27,440
Algonac.

466
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:29,132
Is he married?

467
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,781
Kids?

468
00:28:32,818 --> 00:28:33,931
They couldn't.

469
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,857
Hey, there's some!

470
00:28:40,882 --> 00:28:44,427
Looks like you're gonna
have trouble with this one.

471
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:46,375
He might shoot
the wrong bird.

472
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:49,160
What's that supposed to mean?

473
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,479
Ducks don't land in trees.

474
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:59,723
Why don't we go over there,
stretch our legs?

475
00:29:27,506 --> 00:29:28,815
Want to go first?

476
00:30:06,353 --> 00:30:08,012
You know,
you really piss me off!

477
00:30:10,386 --> 00:30:12,361
Tell me ducks
don't land in trees?

478
00:30:12,402 --> 00:30:14,060
Aah!

479
00:30:14,098 --> 00:30:15,952
I know ducks
don't land in trees.

480
00:30:18,098 --> 00:30:19,920
[Gunshot]

481
00:30:31,057 --> 00:30:32,879
RICHIE: Bird, you comin'?

482
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:52,297
WOMAN: Excuse me.

483
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:56,230
Uh...

484
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:57,702
This is my house.

485
00:31:00,082 --> 00:31:01,511
Uh, yeah.

486
00:31:01,554 --> 00:31:04,107
It's a dump.

487
00:31:04,146 --> 00:31:05,837
You certainly have
your nerve.

488
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:08,456
RICHIE: Donna... ahem.

489
00:31:08,497 --> 00:31:12,075
Donna, this is the Bird.

490
00:31:12,114 --> 00:31:13,902
He's gonna be stayin'
with us for a few days.

491
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,182
What happened to your face?

492
00:31:15,217 --> 00:31:16,875
I got in a fight.

493
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:19,248
We got any beers?

494
00:31:19,282 --> 00:31:21,518
Well, why don't you fix us
somethin' to eat,

495
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:22,568
and I'll go get some.

496
00:31:27,026 --> 00:31:30,670
Hey, don't call me
Bird no more.

497
00:31:30,706 --> 00:31:32,113
Why?

498
00:31:32,145 --> 00:31:33,487
What do you
want me to call you?

499
00:31:34,738 --> 00:31:36,331
My name.

500
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,646
Armand.

501
00:31:37,682 --> 00:31:40,103
Ar-mand? Armand?

502
00:31:40,146 --> 00:31:42,317
Are you serious?

503
00:31:45,522 --> 00:31:46,896
Listen...

504
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:50,859
when she's makin'
all that fuckin' noise in there,

505
00:31:50,897 --> 00:31:52,304
it means she's pissed off.

506
00:31:52,338 --> 00:31:54,225
Why don't you go in there,

507
00:31:54,258 --> 00:31:55,752
give her a little pat
on the ass, huh?

508
00:32:11,953 --> 00:32:14,342
You want the Weight Watchers
chicken patty or the regular?

509
00:32:14,385 --> 00:32:17,768
Mmm...
two Weight Watchers, please.

510
00:32:20,753 --> 00:32:23,503
Richie said you used to be
a hack in the joint.

511
00:32:24,753 --> 00:32:26,761
That how you met?

512
00:32:26,802 --> 00:32:28,941
I was in catering services.

513
00:32:28,978 --> 00:32:32,011
Said you got fired
for screwin' the inmates.

514
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:37,709
You drive
that school bus out there?

515
00:32:43,218 --> 00:32:45,706
Hey, if you could be
any kind of a bird there is...

516
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,688
what kind of bird would you be?

517
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:54,255
What are you doing here?

518
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,016
Just need a place to stay.

519
00:32:59,057 --> 00:33:00,170
For how long?

520
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:03,051
Couple of days.

521
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:04,845
Got some business
to take care of.

522
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,231
You want some bacon
with your chicken patties?

523
00:33:19,217 --> 00:33:22,665
[Noise]

524
00:33:41,137 --> 00:33:42,217
CARMEN: Thanks.

525
00:33:42,257 --> 00:33:43,818
Sure.
Oh, it's my pleasure.

526
00:33:43,858 --> 00:33:47,403
I was busy, but, uh...

527
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,272
Well, I dragged myself away
from starin' at the ceiling.

528
00:33:52,305 --> 00:33:54,891
Well, anyway,
it turned out to be nothing.

529
00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:56,839
I'm so jumpy. I'm sorry.

530
00:33:56,882 --> 00:33:58,256
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

531
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,435
No, no. Go to bed.

532
00:33:59,473 --> 00:34:01,196
I'll grab a beer,
at least till you're asleep.

533
00:34:01,234 --> 00:34:02,543
Well, there's really no need.

534
00:34:02,577 --> 00:34:06,855
Oh. Well, now you're not
scared, I can't have a beer.

535
00:34:06,898 --> 00:34:08,425
Wayne, you shouldn't really
even have keys to the house.

536
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:11,084
I'm confused,
'cause for a second there,

537
00:34:11,122 --> 00:34:12,780
I thought you called me.

538
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,159
I did call you,
and I am nervous,

539
00:34:14,193 --> 00:34:16,528
but if you can just let yourself
in whenever you want...

540
00:34:16,561 --> 00:34:17,489
Which I've never done.

541
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:18,601
But you could.

542
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,878
I don't know.
I know you've been here.

543
00:34:20,913 --> 00:34:21,895
Yeah, but not when you were here.

544
00:34:21,938 --> 00:34:23,563
So you <i>have been here.</i>

545
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:25,008
I fixed the porch light.

546
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:26,896
Carmen, I waited
till you'd gone out

547
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:28,620
so as not to get into a fight.

548
00:34:28,658 --> 00:34:29,901
Which means
you were watching me,

549
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:31,880
which might be why I'm
feeling watched all the time.

550
00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:32,849
Come on!

551
00:34:32,881 --> 00:34:34,059
All right, you know what?

552
00:34:34,097 --> 00:34:36,301
I'm thankful to you
for fixing the porch light.

553
00:34:36,338 --> 00:34:37,832
Yeah, and that faucet
in the bathroom.

554
00:34:37,873 --> 00:34:39,335
And the faucet
in the bathroom, too.

555
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,320
But this was supposed
to be a change.

556
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:43,216
Nothing's changing.

557
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,864
Wayne, I'm moving.

558
00:34:48,497 --> 00:34:50,602
I don't like
being this person

559
00:34:50,642 --> 00:34:53,260
who's blaming you for all
the things I'm blaming you for.

560
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:58,128
You know, there's no, uh...
middle, huh?

561
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:00,333
I mean, this is it with you.

562
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:01,482
You're either fine,

563
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:02,765
or you are leavin'
the country.

564
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:05,168
We don't have kids, fine.

565
00:35:05,202 --> 00:35:06,795
We can't have kids, fine.

566
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:09,703
No, suddenly,
we are killin' ourselves.

567
00:35:09,746 --> 00:35:11,207
We are gettin' a divorce.

568
00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:12,908
We are leavin' the country.

569
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:16,491
I mean,
it's like it's zero or ten.

570
00:35:16,529 --> 00:35:18,700
I mean, what happened to five?

571
00:35:18,738 --> 00:35:20,876
Five's pretty great.

572
00:35:20,914 --> 00:35:22,888
I'll take five again
in a fuckin' minute.

573

RICHIE: See?
What I tell you?

574
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:29,001
He's fuckin' that woman
from the real estate office.

575
00:35:50,545 --> 00:35:51,473
I got him!

576
00:35:51,505 --> 00:35:52,749
You get the woman!

- It's me.
- Mom.

Oh, ask me something else.

I went to see

584
00:36:24,018 --> 00:36:25,741
that doctor again
this afternoon.

585
00:36:25,777 --> 00:36:27,817
I told him those pills
don't agree with me at all.

Hey, Mom,
I have to call you back.

BLACKBIRD:
You going hunting, miss?

588
00:36:53,105 --> 00:36:54,414
I was looking
for your husband,

589
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:55,594
have a talk with him.

590
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:56,615
He's not home.

591
00:36:58,193 --> 00:36:59,469
I know that.

592
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:01,894
I was wondering maybe
I'd come inside and wait.

593
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:07,049
We met before, remember?
At the real estate office.

594
00:37:12,817 --> 00:37:14,890

any minute.

to call them, huh?

you're going to shoot me.

I thought she'd gotten
out of there!

How many times
are you gonna go

622
00:39:58,673 --> 00:40:01,291
look at that bullet hole
in the tree?

623

My wife told you that she
wasn't tryin' to hit him,

624
00:40:04,177 --> 00:40:05,965
and you guys act like
you don't believe her!

625
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:08,652
Not one of you guys
has said, "Nice goin',"

or that was brave thing
my wife did!

are tryin' to kill us,

I'm Paul Scallen,

as the guy's car.

A big goddamn Cadillac
nobody can seem to find.

634

Oh, we found it
on Walpole Island.

635
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:32,139
Only there wasn't
a lot of paintwork left.

636
00:40:32,177 --> 00:40:35,243
Mr. Colson, do you know
a Lionel Adam?

637
00:40:36,306 --> 00:40:38,029
Yeah, sure.

638
00:40:38,065 --> 00:40:39,821
Well, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

639
00:40:43,313 --> 00:40:45,899
Would you mind telling us who
the hell these assholes are now

640
00:40:45,937 --> 00:40:48,239
and why would they want
to kill Lionel Adam?

SCALLEN:
We don't know for sure.

642
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:51,982
We think they were
trying to find you.

643
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:53,927
It seems you and your wife
had a good look at them.

644
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:55,595
WAYNE: So what?

645
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:57,095
All they were doin'
at that point

646
00:40:57,137 --> 00:40:59,177
was shakin' down
a real estate business.

647
00:40:59,217 --> 00:41:01,322
SCALLEN:
This one maybe, but...

648
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:02,605
this one's
got more of a history.

649
00:41:02,641 --> 00:41:04,135
His name's Armand Degas.

650
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:05,803
He's known as The Blackbird.

651
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:09,005
He's a contract killer
for the Toronto Mafia.

652
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:11,180
Takes an awful lot of nerve
to stand up to a man like that.

653
00:41:11,217 --> 00:41:13,705
What does the Toronto Mafia
have to do with us?

654
00:41:13,745 --> 00:41:14,793
Last week,
the head of the family

655
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:16,459
was shot dead
in a Detroit hotel room,

656
00:41:16,497 --> 00:41:18,985
along with a girl
who might have seen it happen.

657
00:41:19,025 --> 00:41:20,585
We think it was an inside job.

658
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:21,770
And thanks to you,

659
00:41:21,809 --> 00:41:24,591
we know that Degas
was in the area at the time.

660
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,697
So if we can, uh,
pick him up,

661
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:27,914
even if it's
just for extortion,

662
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:29,807
there's a chance that
he may want to cut a deal.

663
00:41:29,841 --> 00:41:31,368
WAYNE: Wait.

664
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:34,311
You want us to testify
against a Mafia hitman?

665
00:41:34,353 --> 00:41:37,255
He's gonna come
after you either way.

666
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:41,129
Without you, there's nothing
to say he was even here.

667
00:41:41,169 --> 00:41:42,958
WAYNE:
So what do you suggest?

668
00:41:44,273 --> 00:41:45,353
Well, your lives
are in danger,

669
00:41:45,393 --> 00:41:47,564
so we figure you qualify
for federal protection

670
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:49,095
under the Witness
Security Program.

671
00:41:53,265 --> 00:41:55,632
You want to move us
someplace else?

672
00:41:55,665 --> 00:41:57,127
SCALLEN: Until we find them.

673
00:41:57,169 --> 00:41:59,308
We'll provide you
with new identities,

674
00:41:59,345 --> 00:42:01,167
temporary employment.

675
00:42:01,201 --> 00:42:03,535
You won't need
to sell the house.

676
00:42:03,569 --> 00:42:05,423
I'm sure we can make a deal
with this Nelson Davies,

677
00:42:05,457 --> 00:42:07,562
have his company appear
to offer it for sale.

678
00:42:27,665 --> 00:42:28,811
Yeah?

679
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:29,797
BLACKBIRD: It's me.

680
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:33,288
Why the fuck
are you callin' me here?

681
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:34,277
BLACKBIRD: I need a car.

682
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:36,077
A clean one with papers.

683
00:42:36,113 --> 00:42:38,284
MAN: Word is,
you really upset the man.

684
00:42:38,321 --> 00:42:40,263
He was fuckin' that girl
you blew away.

685
00:42:40,305 --> 00:42:42,214
BLACKBIRD:
Can you arrange it or not?

686
00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:44,264
You can't come here.

687
00:42:44,305 --> 00:42:46,345
They got everyone
lookin' for you.

688
00:42:52,561 --> 00:42:54,568
FBI AGENT: We'll transfer
your baggage overnight.

689
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:57,391
Replacement vehicles will be
waiting for you in the morning.

690
00:42:57,425 --> 00:42:58,473
Your own will be held

691
00:42:58,513 --> 00:43:00,007
until you're released
from the program.

692
00:43:00,049 --> 00:43:01,544
WAYNE: Never hear about that,
do you?

693
00:43:01,585 --> 00:43:03,145
People gettin'
out of witness protection?

694
00:43:03,185 --> 00:43:05,935
Destination location
is Cape Girardeau.

695
00:43:05,969 --> 00:43:07,463
That's about
another 2-hour drive

696
00:43:07,505 --> 00:43:09,196
south down the Mississippi River.

697
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:12,103
Now, you'll be checking in here
under your new names.

698
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:17,328
You must be Pam Benkowski.

699
00:43:19,217 --> 00:43:21,453
I'm your husband Matt.

700
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:39,686
FEMALE FBI AGENT:
It's best to stick

701
00:43:39,729 --> 00:43:41,289
as close
to the truth as possible.

702
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:42,890
That way, you're less
likely to have trouble

703
00:43:42,929 --> 00:43:44,139
with your invented histories.

704
00:43:45,969 --> 00:43:48,140
How long you been married?

705
00:43:48,177 --> 00:43:49,104
WAYNE: 15 years.

706
00:43:49,137 --> 00:43:50,511
AGENT: Where'd you meet?

707
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,399
WAYNE: On a building site
in Saint Auburn.

708
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:55,215
June 4, 1991.

709
00:43:55,249 --> 00:43:56,656
AGENT:
Who asked who out first?

710
00:43:56,689 --> 00:43:57,737
CARMEN: I did.

711
00:43:57,777 --> 00:44:00,013
How long after that
were you married?

712
00:44:00,049 --> 00:44:01,031
A week.

713
00:44:01,073 --> 00:44:02,829
How many children?

714
00:44:04,657 --> 00:44:06,217
Almost one.

715
00:44:11,505 --> 00:44:12,617
RICHIE: Well, if they moved,

716
00:44:12,657 --> 00:44:14,184
how come all their furniture's
still here?

717
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,779
Hey, Bird.

718
00:44:20,817 --> 00:44:22,344
What?

719
00:44:23,313 --> 00:44:25,135
You gonna kill Donna, too?

720
00:44:28,305 --> 00:44:29,515
I mean, you're goin'
to all this trouble

721
00:44:29,553 --> 00:44:31,495
findin' witnesses,
and she's a witness.

722
00:44:31,537 --> 00:44:33,326
What does that make you?

723
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,713
No, you need me.

724
00:44:36,753 --> 00:44:39,404
Leave my fingerprints
everywhere.

725
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,869
Steal cars and shoot people,

726
00:44:40,913 --> 00:44:41,861
do all your dirty work
for you.

727
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:48,078
[Phone ringing]

728
00:44:54,897 --> 00:44:56,359
Who is it?

729
00:44:56,401 --> 00:44:59,750
Uh, yes, ma'am,
I'm looking for Wayne Colson.

730
00:44:59,793 --> 00:45:02,510
Who gave you my number?

731
00:45:02,545 --> 00:45:03,690
Excuse me, ma'am.

732
00:45:03,729 --> 00:45:05,071
That was a new fella
works here

733
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:06,185
I just asked to call you.

734
00:45:06,224 --> 00:45:07,980
We been tryin'
to get ahold of Wayne,

735
00:45:08,017 --> 00:45:10,505
and, uh, he gave us
this number before he left.

736
00:45:10,545 --> 00:45:12,912
He gave you my number?

737
00:45:12,944 --> 00:45:15,432
Well, as a matter of fact,
he gave it to the boss.

738
00:45:15,472 --> 00:45:16,716
Boss gave it to me.

739
00:45:16,753 --> 00:45:18,760
Only he isn't here right now
'cause it's so late,

740
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,550
but, uh, he said that
you'd know where he was.

741
00:45:21,584 --> 00:45:22,730
Wayne, that is.

742
00:45:22,769 --> 00:45:24,492
LENORE: I don't know
where they've gone.

743
00:45:24,529 --> 00:45:26,416
Wayne and my daughter
never tell me anything.

744
00:45:26,449 --> 00:45:29,710
RICHIE: See, 'cause I got this
check I'm tryin' to send him.

745
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,109
Yeah. Yes.

746
00:45:47,569 --> 00:45:49,391
FBI AGENT: Mr. Benkowski.

747
00:45:49,424 --> 00:45:52,174
Mrs. Benkowski.
Good morning. Welcome.

748
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:53,136
- Morning.
- Hello.

749
00:45:53,169 --> 00:45:54,314
- Hi.
- Hi.

750
00:45:54,353 --> 00:45:55,662
Shall we?

751
00:45:55,697 --> 00:46:00,748
AGENT: If the neighbors ask,
you paid about $200,000 for it.

752
00:46:00,785 --> 00:46:03,469
CARMEN: It looks more
like 150 to me.

753
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:37,032
# The best I can #

754
00:46:37,072 --> 00:46:40,967
# But it's not good #

755
00:46:41,008 --> 00:46:43,594
# Enough for you #

756
00:46:45,393 --> 00:46:50,379
# You know I was
the kind who'd run #

757
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:53,199
# Anytime you'd call #

758
00:46:53,232 --> 00:46:57,160
# I guess I was the only one #

759
00:46:57,201 --> 00:47:00,332
# Who didn't mind at all #

760
00:47:00,368 --> 00:47:02,824
# I'll be your dreamer #

761
00:47:03,952 --> 00:47:07,913
# I'll be your fool #

762
00:47:07,953 --> 00:47:11,815
# Oh, my darling #

763
00:47:11,857 --> 00:47:15,818
# My whole life through #

764
00:47:15,857 --> 00:47:19,632
# Doing the best #

765
00:47:19,664 --> 00:47:22,763
# The best I can #

766
00:47:23,985 --> 00:47:25,261
# But it's not good #

767
00:47:25,297 --> 00:47:27,817
Sure ain't much privacy
around here.

768
00:47:27,856 --> 00:47:29,002
# Enough for you... #

769
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:34,126
You want privacy,
you close the door.

770
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,102
But I don't think
that's what you want.

771
00:47:37,648 --> 00:47:40,332
Well, I guess you're gonna do
whatever it is you want.

772
00:47:44,368 --> 00:47:46,790
There's no way on earth
I can stop you.

773
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:09,320
There'll be a slight delay
in the divorce proceedings

774
00:48:09,361 --> 00:48:11,368
while the couple hides out
from the killers.

775
00:48:13,969 --> 00:48:15,049
Good night.

776
00:48:15,088 --> 00:48:16,943
# Every time you kiss me #

777
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:21,417
# I'm still not certain
that you love me #

778
00:48:21,456 --> 00:48:24,424
DONNA: This is Elvis Presley
Boulevard on a rainy day.

779
00:48:24,465 --> 00:48:27,312
This is the <i>Lisa Marie.</i>

780
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:28,359
It's a jetliner he bought.

781
00:48:28,401 --> 00:48:30,343
He named it
after his daughter.

782
00:48:30,385 --> 00:48:32,141
Her and I have
the same birthday.

783
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:34,762
And I'll tell ya
somethin' else.

784
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,655
My life number is 9.

785
00:48:36,689 --> 00:48:37,933
BLACKBIRD:
What's a life number?

786
00:48:37,969 --> 00:48:42,192
Okay, well, you add up
your date of birth, right?

787
00:48:42,224 --> 00:48:44,810
Um, like February's
the second month, so that's 2.

788
00:48:44,848 --> 00:48:48,776
I was born on the first.
That's 1, so 2 and 1 is 3.

789
00:48:48,817 --> 00:48:50,475
Then you add in the year
that you were born.

790
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:52,814
I'm not gonna tell you
when that was,

791
00:48:52,848 --> 00:48:54,703
but my number
comes out to 9.

792
00:48:54,737 --> 00:48:56,362
BLACKBIRD:
Even if you were born in 1900,

793
00:48:56,401 --> 00:48:58,856
that'd still add up to 10.

794
00:48:58,896 --> 00:49:01,067
Yeah, see, 10 counts as 1.

795
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:04,204
Donna, get dressed,
go buy some fuckin' beers.

796
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,997
Think he cares
about your queer photos?

797
00:49:06,032 --> 00:49:07,821
- You're just jealous.
- Jealous of what?

798
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:09,744
You know what the difference
between me and Elvis is?

799
00:49:09,777 --> 00:49:11,303
Yeah. You're ignorant.

800
00:49:11,345 --> 00:49:13,483
No. I'm alive,
and he's dead.

801
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:15,430
Well, I got news for you.

802
00:49:15,472 --> 00:49:17,261
After you die,
you think anybody's

803
00:49:17,296 --> 00:49:18,922
gonna go and visit your grave?

804
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,059
Not even your mama,
if you had one.

805
00:49:22,096 --> 00:49:23,623
But a hundred years from now,

806
00:49:23,664 --> 00:49:25,803
people will still be going
to Graceland.

807
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,775
Donna,
you're so goddamn stupid.

808
00:49:28,816 --> 00:49:31,566
Let me ask you
a question, Donna.

809
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,226
Would you rather
have Elvis sing to you

810
00:49:33,264 --> 00:49:34,246
or fuck you?

811
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:36,907
I know what you think
I'm gonna say,

812
00:49:36,944 --> 00:49:38,188
and you'll probably
call me a liar,

813
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,396
but I'd rather
have him sing to me.

814
00:49:40,432 --> 00:49:42,767
Damn. You know what?
I believe her, though.

815
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,262
'cause Elvis
wasn't no con.

816
00:49:44,305 --> 00:49:46,694
He wouldn't have been dirty
or smelly enough for Donna.

817
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:49,420
Hey, leave her alone.

818
00:49:49,457 --> 00:49:50,918
Who, Donna?

819
00:49:50,961 --> 00:49:54,343
Why don't you
shut the fuck up for a while?

820
00:49:56,881 --> 00:49:59,019
If you ever talk to me
like that again...

821
00:49:59,057 --> 00:50:00,551
Yeah?

822
00:50:00,592 --> 00:50:02,021
What?

823
00:50:03,216 --> 00:50:05,605
This is
Elvis' billiard room.

824
00:50:05,648 --> 00:50:07,852
There's 750 yards of material...

825
00:50:07,889 --> 00:50:10,027
Can I have a word... Armand?

826
00:50:13,617 --> 00:50:16,617
What the fuck
is your problem?!

827
00:50:16,656 --> 00:50:17,605
You are.

828
00:50:18,609 --> 00:50:22,438
And from now on, you don't
leave my fucking sight.

829
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,335
Well, how about
when I go to the bathroom?

830
00:50:24,369 --> 00:50:25,296
You wanna watch?

831
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:26,474
Or when I'm givin'
Donna a jump

832
00:50:26,512 --> 00:50:27,974
and you're out there,
wishin' it was you.

833
00:50:28,017 --> 00:50:30,864
Or do we keep pretendin' that
you're not tryin' to fuck her?

834
00:50:34,577 --> 00:50:37,708
Hey, you listen to me.

835
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:42,187
Keep your big
fucking mouth shut,

836
00:50:42,224 --> 00:50:44,166
and don't worry about it.

837
00:50:45,968 --> 00:50:47,343
MAN: So you're a welder, huh?

838
00:50:47,376 --> 00:50:49,645
WAYNE: You bet I am.
AWS certified.

839
00:50:49,681 --> 00:50:51,568
Can you weld plates
watertight?

840
00:50:51,601 --> 00:50:55,310
Well, I can weld a goddamn
building so it won't fall down.

841
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:57,930
MAN: I got a job you might
want to take a look at.

842
00:51:03,569 --> 00:51:04,648
BLACKBIRD: Hey.

843
00:51:04,689 --> 00:51:08,005
Maybe today she can't
tell us where they are.

844
00:51:08,048 --> 00:51:11,015
But tomorrow, she might.

845
00:51:27,825 --> 00:51:30,923
What job were
you and Wayne working on?

846
00:51:32,752 --> 00:51:34,825
Well, we've been
on different ones.

847
00:51:34,865 --> 00:51:36,556
Anyway, what I started
to tell you,

848
00:51:36,592 --> 00:51:39,112
I don't see what difference
it makes who mails the check,

849
00:51:39,153 --> 00:51:42,666
you or us, but the boss says
we have to do it.

850
00:51:42,704 --> 00:51:44,614
Now, I told him you were
a nice lady to offer...

851
00:51:44,657 --> 00:51:46,828
And I told you,
I don't have their address.

852
00:51:46,864 --> 00:51:47,944
She never gave it to me.

853
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:49,839
The only thing I have
is their phone number.

854
00:51:49,872 --> 00:51:51,595
You want that?

855
00:51:51,633 --> 00:51:54,764
Oh. Well, you didn't
mention that, did you?

856
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,044
You have their number?

857
00:51:56,081 --> 00:51:58,382
Not on the phone, I didn't.

858
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:03,053
I wasn't absolutely positive
whom I was speaking to.

859
00:52:03,088 --> 00:52:04,681
That's how they find out
if you're home

860
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:07,754
so they can come in
and rape you.

861
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,698
I understand.

862
00:52:10,737 --> 00:52:11,981
Can't be too careful.

863
00:52:12,016 --> 00:52:14,471
You give him a check... hmm!

864
00:52:14,513 --> 00:52:17,415
And you know
where he'll cash it, don't ya?

865
00:52:17,457 --> 00:52:19,180
The nearest bar.

866
00:52:19,217 --> 00:52:20,297
Oh!

867
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,573
What's wrong?

868
00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:25,292
I should never bend
that far from the waist!

869
00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:28,263
It's like somebody
stuck a knife in me.

870
00:52:28,305 --> 00:52:29,646
Oh!

871
00:52:29,681 --> 00:52:32,463
That's your sacroiliac.

872
00:52:32,496 --> 00:52:35,344
Why don't you lay down
on the couch?

873
00:52:40,368 --> 00:52:44,809
No, no, let's get you
down here on the carpet.

874
00:52:44,848 --> 00:52:46,190
I'm gonna give you
a backrub.

875
00:52:46,224 --> 00:52:48,461
I had a foster mom
one time named Jackie.

876
00:52:48,496 --> 00:52:49,543
She was some kind of therapist.

877
00:52:49,585 --> 00:52:51,308
She worked with cripples.

878
00:52:51,344 --> 00:52:52,654
She showed me how.

879
00:52:52,688 --> 00:52:56,071
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

880
00:52:56,112 --> 00:52:57,127
Yes, ma'am.

881
00:52:57,169 --> 00:52:58,696
Oh!

882
00:53:00,816 --> 00:53:03,304
You're not gonna hurt me,
are you?

883
00:53:06,832 --> 00:53:10,061
Oh! Ohh!

884
00:53:14,384 --> 00:53:16,392
What the fuck
did you do?

885
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:25,061
Oh, God! Fuck!
I just gave her a backrub.

886
00:53:25,105 --> 00:53:26,446
Jesus!

887
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,058
It's a Missouri code.

888
00:53:30,096 --> 00:53:32,136
I did a bank there once.

889

We'll call you back.

Wayne.

No, I'm fine.

901
00:54:44,689 --> 00:54:45,899
What?

902
00:54:45,936 --> 00:54:48,009
I'm losing you. What?

We gotta make a plan.

RICHIE:
That's my fucking phone!

905
00:54:51,952 --> 00:54:54,341
You want to wait
till they trace the number?

906
00:54:54,385 --> 00:54:56,359
That thing had all
my fuckin' numbers in it.

907
00:54:58,288 --> 00:55:00,230
Why don't we go to Missouri?

908
00:55:00,272 --> 00:55:01,701
- We will.
- Yeah? When?

909
00:55:01,744 --> 00:55:03,632
When they stop looking
for us,

910
00:55:03,664 --> 00:55:06,698
or when they think
we stopped looking for them.

911
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:10,478
So, Gerald,
this is the master bedroom.

912
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,063
I love how you guys
say "master bedroom."

913
00:55:17,104 --> 00:55:20,071
Yes, we guys
like our guy words.

914
00:55:21,648 --> 00:55:23,982
You're not from here.

915
00:55:24,016 --> 00:55:25,260
That's right.

916
00:55:25,296 --> 00:55:26,954
Where are you from?

917
00:55:31,216 --> 00:55:32,645
Detroit way.

918
00:55:32,689 --> 00:55:34,445
I know Detroit.

919
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,579
We, uh, didn't look
at the kitchen.

920

Are you following me?

Well, you should know.

926
00:56:02,097 --> 00:56:03,209
You were outside
this morning.

927
00:56:03,248 --> 00:56:04,841
Hey, did you make
a sale with Gerald?

928
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,018
I know he's been
looking at a lot of places.

929
00:56:07,056 --> 00:56:08,517
Do they know we're here?

What if the FBI's just waiting

937
00:56:26,128 --> 00:56:27,557
for those two freaks
to find us

938
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,608
so they can find them?

show up here, Wayne?

00:56:35,632 --> 00:56:36,680
Sure.

Yeah, I vote for before.

944

to pretend to do my job here.

I'm just waiting

for somebody
to pull a gun on me.

What's the choice?
I mean, I don't understand.

948
00:56:47,248 --> 00:56:48,742
I could sit here
and go crazy.

949
00:56:48,785 --> 00:56:50,727
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

and their wives.

along the river.

We could get something to eat.

957
00:57:07,664 --> 00:57:10,566
Does nothing bother you?

958
00:57:10,608 --> 00:57:12,135
Sure, yeah.
This bothers me.

959
00:57:12,177 --> 00:57:13,486
You and me.

960
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:16,518
Not gangsters.

00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:05,548
I need you to do
something for me.

962
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,909
Is that what you dragged me
out here to tell me?

963
00:58:11,312 --> 00:58:13,287
You got some balls on you,
chief, I'll give you that.

964
00:58:13,328 --> 00:58:15,783
I don't give a fuck
what you need.

965
00:58:15,824 --> 00:58:17,679
Yes, you do.

966
00:58:17,712 --> 00:58:19,883
That's why you come
when I called.

967
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:23,404
You don't want
the cops picking me up.

968
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,407
If for some reason
they start asking me,

969
00:58:26,448 --> 00:58:29,580
was I in Detroit
when the old man was killed.

970
00:58:29,616 --> 00:58:31,885
And how the fuck
they gonna connect me

971
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,097
to a half-breed
piece of shit

972
00:58:33,136 --> 00:58:34,827
they dragged up
from the bottom of this lake?

973
00:58:36,464 --> 00:58:39,246
The blue Cadillac
you gave me,

974
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,582
the one with the papers
in the glove compartment,

975
00:58:41,616 --> 00:58:45,358
registered
to your pepperoni company.

976
00:58:45,392 --> 00:58:47,596
Anything happen to me,

977
00:58:47,632 --> 00:58:50,479
a friend gonna drive the car
to some precinct.

978
00:58:50,512 --> 00:58:52,650
They gonna find
the piece I used

979
00:58:52,688 --> 00:58:56,485
to whack the old man for you
wrapped in a letter...

980
00:58:56,528 --> 00:58:59,211
from me about you.

981
00:58:59,248 --> 00:59:01,614
Not a love letter.

982
00:59:03,152 --> 00:59:06,250
This is what
you're gonna do for me.

983
00:59:06,288 --> 00:59:09,190
There's a cemetery
in Port Huron.

984
00:59:09,232 --> 00:59:12,266
My kid brother
is buried there.

985
00:59:12,304 --> 00:59:15,882
He never had the kind
of funeral he deserved.

986
00:59:18,736 --> 00:59:21,224
WAYNE: You can be walkin' around
on that skinny little beam,

987
00:59:21,264 --> 00:59:23,533
and you've got clouds
around your head.

988
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,295
I mean, some days, you think
you see things so clear.

989
00:59:28,336 --> 00:59:31,500
The place you live,
the store you shop in,

990
00:59:31,536 --> 00:59:33,030
the church
you got married in.

991
00:59:33,072 --> 00:59:34,446
I could see everything.

992
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,236
Everywhere I'd ever been
my whole life

993
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:37,930
from the top of a building.

994
00:59:37,968 --> 00:59:40,750
MAN: So why the hell
did you quit and come here?

995
00:59:40,784 --> 00:59:42,889
Job quit me, man.

996
00:59:42,928 --> 00:59:44,935
Get to an age,
they start pullin' you down,

997
00:59:44,976 --> 00:59:46,983
about one floor a year.

998
00:59:47,024 --> 00:59:48,682
End up too near the ground.

999
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,956
I got my pride.

1000
00:59:50,992 --> 00:59:52,453
Too much maybe.

1001
00:59:52,496 --> 00:59:54,536
WAITRESS:
I've been watchin' you, honey,

1002
00:59:54,576 --> 00:59:56,299
and you should talk less
and drink more.

1003
00:59:58,544 --> 01:00:00,137
I think these poor folks

1004
01:00:00,176 --> 01:00:03,111
deserve another round there,
uh... Linda.

1005
01:00:03,152 --> 01:00:05,257
MAN: Oh, ho ho, yeah.

1006
01:00:05,296 --> 01:00:07,238
Hey, Pam, honey,
how did you, uh...

1007
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,095
fall for a shy guy like Matt?

1008
01:00:11,504 --> 01:00:13,576
- His muscles.
- Ahh!

1009
01:00:13,616 --> 01:00:14,696
And the short shorts.

1010
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:15,913
Ooh!

1011
01:00:15,952 --> 01:00:17,545
CARMEN: Nah, he was
a show-off, even back then.

1012
01:00:17,584 --> 01:00:19,820
I had to show off
to get her attention.

1013
01:00:19,856 --> 01:00:22,125
Every guy in town's
chasin' after her.

1014
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:24,810
Not only is she gorgeous,
she's smart as a whip.

1015
01:00:24,848 --> 01:00:26,157
Don't exaggerate, Matthew.

1016
01:00:26,192 --> 01:00:28,199
Her mother's always sayin',
"Carmen, honey"...

1017
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,301
because that's
what her mother called her

1018
01:00:32,336 --> 01:00:33,612
'cause she's a great singer.

1019
01:00:33,648 --> 01:00:36,201
She'd say, "Carmen, honey,

1020
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,345
"you're a talented,
beautiful girl.

1021
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:41,417
"Don't go wastin' your life
on an ironworker.

1022
01:00:41,456 --> 01:00:43,180
"You're gonna wake up
in 20 years,

1023
01:00:43,216 --> 01:00:46,064
and you're gonna realize,
he never deserved you."

1024
01:00:47,568 --> 01:00:49,161
15 years.

1025
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,233
He is such a liar.

1026
01:00:52,271 --> 01:00:53,580
My mother adores him.

1027
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,721
We got karaoke here
on Friday.

1028
01:00:55,759 --> 01:00:57,003
You gotta come.

1029
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:57,967
- Yeah!
- Oh, no.

1030
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,105
You wait.
She's a knockout.

1031
01:01:00,144 --> 01:01:02,348
Ah ha ha. I'm gonna
knock you out, Matt.

1032
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:10,860
"I have been
watching you, honey.

1033
01:01:10,896 --> 01:01:12,968
You should talk less
and drink more."

1034
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,512
Why is it that
I feel I know you best

1035
01:01:17,552 --> 01:01:20,007
when I hear you talking
with other people?

1036
01:01:20,048 --> 01:01:21,357
WAYNE: I felt good tonight.

1037
01:01:21,392 --> 01:01:22,799
I like this town.

1038
01:01:24,272 --> 01:01:26,028
Telling all your stories.

1039
01:01:26,064 --> 01:01:27,526
Hey, nothin'
I said tonight back there

1040
01:01:27,568 --> 01:01:28,877
wasn't the God's truth.

1041
01:01:28,912 --> 01:01:30,537
Hmm.

1042
01:01:31,887 --> 01:01:32,902
No.

1043
01:01:33,872 --> 01:01:35,366
Don't turn on the light.

1044
01:01:43,536 --> 01:01:44,780
You married?

1045
01:01:47,216 --> 01:01:49,583
No, sir, I'm on a break.

1046
01:01:50,704 --> 01:01:52,231
Live around here?

1047
01:01:53,808 --> 01:01:56,077
I can't tell you
where I live.

1048
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:57,672
That's a government secret.

1049
01:02:55,952 --> 01:02:57,294
SCALLEN: We found them
last week.

1050
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,789
Two bodies, probably shot,
driven to a remote location,

1051
01:03:02,831 --> 01:03:04,358
and burned in the car.

1052
01:03:04,399 --> 01:03:06,025
Nothing much left
to be identified.

1053
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,727
The Indian has
a surviving brother.

1054
01:03:10,767 --> 01:03:13,134
He's doing life in Kingston
Correctional Facility.

1055
01:03:14,511 --> 01:03:17,610
We ran DNA tests,
and we checked them against his.

1056
01:03:19,792 --> 01:03:21,166
Match was positive.

1057
01:03:25,232 --> 01:03:27,119
What happens to us now?

1058
01:03:27,152 --> 01:03:28,712
Well,
after we close the case,

1059
01:03:28,751 --> 01:03:31,402
you can go back
to your life.

1060
01:03:31,439 --> 01:03:33,000
What if we
don't want to go back?

1061
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,982
SCALLEN: That happens.

1062
01:03:37,295 --> 01:03:40,165
But what you're saying is,
if we wanted to, we could?

1063
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:41,964
That also happens.

1064
01:03:52,047 --> 01:03:53,640
It's still busy.

1065
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,989
Try her again.

1066
01:03:57,007 --> 01:03:59,179
I'm not your fuckin'
kid brother.

1067
01:03:59,216 --> 01:04:00,361
You can't order me around.

1068
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,018
I know that, Richie.
I buried my kid brother.

1069
01:04:03,056 --> 01:04:05,129
So lighten up. We're dead.

1070
01:04:05,168 --> 01:04:08,430
If they dig around some more,
we're alive.

1071
01:04:08,464 --> 01:04:10,886
We just bought us
some more time, that's all.

1072
01:04:10,928 --> 01:04:12,422
Now try the old lady again.

1073
01:04:15,152 --> 01:04:17,453
WAYNE: She's, uh, packing,
Lenore. Let me go find her.

1074
01:04:21,072 --> 01:04:23,821
She says she'll call you
when she gets back to the house.

1075
01:04:23,856 --> 01:04:25,449
LENORE: You're not
coming together?

1076
01:04:25,488 --> 01:04:26,503
No. As a matter of fact,

1077
01:04:26,544 --> 01:04:28,846
I'm stayin' down here
for a while.

1078
01:04:28,879 --> 01:04:30,373
LENORE: What do you mean,
for a while?

1079
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:33,318
Kind of a trial separation.

1080
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,531
LENORE: I don't understand.

1081
01:04:35,568 --> 01:04:37,226
I'm not sure we do, either.

1082
01:04:37,264 --> 01:04:40,046
But that's where we're at.

1083
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,967
LENORE: Have you been
fighting again?

1084
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,625
No, no fighting.

1085
01:04:43,664 --> 01:04:44,744
LENORE:
You will not break up.

1086
01:04:44,784 --> 01:04:46,693
Lord knows
I prayed for it.

1087
01:04:46,736 --> 01:04:48,492
WAYNE: Okay, Mom,
appreciate it.

1088
01:04:51,664 --> 01:04:55,625
Well, she says
no way we'll break up.

1089
01:04:55,663 --> 01:04:58,598
"Lord knows I prayed for it.
It'll never happen."

1090
01:05:01,744 --> 01:05:06,730
<i>Mississippi River Navigation</i>
<i>and Rules of Inland Waterways?</i>

1091
01:05:06,768 --> 01:05:08,743
Homework.

1092
01:05:08,784 --> 01:05:09,766
Lot of laughs.

1093
01:05:11,471 --> 01:05:13,381
I'll wait for the movie.

1094
01:05:14,671 --> 01:05:16,297
Can we at least
give it a try...

1095
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:19,502
now that we're safe?

1096
01:05:19,536 --> 01:05:21,226
Maybe Matt and Pam
can fix the things

1097
01:05:21,264 --> 01:05:22,638
Wayne and Carmen
never could.

1098
01:05:24,176 --> 01:05:25,582
Do you honestly believe that?

1099
01:05:25,616 --> 01:05:27,307
I honestly do.

1100
01:05:30,704 --> 01:05:31,652
Stay.

1101
01:05:33,551 --> 01:05:35,078
- No.
- Stay.

1102
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:36,047
No.

1103
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:37,224
Fight with me.

1104
01:05:37,264 --> 01:05:38,246
No.

1105
01:05:38,288 --> 01:05:39,662
Don't say no.

1106
01:05:39,696 --> 01:05:41,321
CARMEN: It's not one thing.

1107
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,229
It's not one day.

1108
01:05:44,271 --> 01:05:47,588
It's not a baby, or...

1109
01:05:47,632 --> 01:05:48,712
no baby.

1110
01:05:50,256 --> 01:05:52,078
It's years.

1111
01:05:53,136 --> 01:05:55,176
And I need time, Wayne.

1112
01:05:55,216 --> 01:05:58,532
Time to remember
what I cared for you,

1113
01:05:58,575 --> 01:06:00,299
and what you cared for me.

1114
01:06:00,335 --> 01:06:01,448
Okay, let's fix that.

1115
01:06:03,408 --> 01:06:05,034
I think we can fix that.

1116
01:06:06,736 --> 01:06:08,841
I think we started
to fix it right here.

1117
01:06:16,399 --> 01:06:18,472
[Phone ringing]

1118
01:06:24,816 --> 01:06:25,928
LENORE: Who is it?

1119
01:06:47,695 --> 01:06:48,906
Are you leaving?

1120
01:06:53,647 --> 01:06:54,596
Richie, too?

1121
01:06:59,536 --> 01:07:02,121
What did he tell you
about me?

1122
01:07:03,663 --> 01:07:05,518
You know how he is.

1123
01:07:05,552 --> 01:07:07,046
He brags about you a lot.

1124
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,853
What I do for a living?

1125
01:07:12,591 --> 01:07:14,413
That's none
of my business, Armand.

1126

Your mom told us
you'd be home by breakfast.

I want to get somethin' here.

You want to fix
the Bird some lunch?

No.

'Cause Wade Boggs ate
chicken before every game.

You don't have to take off
all your clothes.

weighed 1,200 pounds.
Can you believe that?

1230

For breakfast, he'd have
like two pounds of bacon,

a dozen eggs, some rolls.

1232

Then for lunch,
he'd have four hamburgers,

four double cheeseburgers,
eight boxes of fries.

1234

For dinner, three ham steaks,
six sweet potatoes,

We were in a hospital
one time on a job.

there was this nurse
standing there.

She saw us do it.

My kid brother just stood there,
looking at her.

He looked at her too long.

1254

Maybe he liked her face.

1255
01:18:57,103 --> 01:18:58,826
Anyway,
that's what killed him.

I'm not the same as him.

You kid yourself

Sees who you really are
under all the shit.

1265

Turns out, just another bitch
with the lip service.

- I do see you.
- Shut up.

when I saw the gun.

1269
01:21:14,095 --> 01:21:15,022

Well, then you call him.

You call him, and
you tell him to get back here.

Real life?

1286
01:21:52,143 --> 01:21:53,998
What the fuck is that?

1287
01:22:15,215 --> 01:22:16,589
Missouri, huh?

1288
01:22:24,494 --> 01:22:25,639
WAYNE: Carmen?

1289
01:22:27,343 --> 01:22:28,390
It's me!

1290
01:22:30,415 --> 01:22:32,040
Tried calling.

1291
01:22:33,423 --> 01:22:34,601
Honey?

1292
01:22:36,814 --> 01:22:37,927
You're gonna have to let me in.

1293
01:22:37,967 --> 01:22:40,007
I... I don't have a key.

1294
01:22:40,046 --> 01:22:41,475
CARMEN: Wayne, please go.

1295
01:22:41,518 --> 01:22:42,893
WAYNE: Okay, all right.

1296
01:22:42,926 --> 01:22:44,999
Just hear me out.

1297
01:22:47,151 --> 01:22:51,558
Look, I've had 400 miles,
15 years

1298
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:53,126
to think about this, so...

1299
01:22:54,927 --> 01:22:56,715
say five's terrible, right?

1300
01:22:56,751 --> 01:22:58,889
That's what you said.

1301
01:22:58,927 --> 01:23:01,512
So let's go for six.

1302
01:23:02,542 --> 01:23:08,172
And then if we make it to six,
then we could try for seven.

1303
01:23:09,295 --> 01:23:14,630
'Cause... I really want
to make it to 10 for you.

1304
01:23:16,047 --> 01:23:19,724
Carmen, 'cause I get it now.

1305
01:23:19,758 --> 01:23:21,700
Carmen?

1306
01:23:29,262 --> 01:23:30,888
I understand.

1307
01:23:30,926 --> 01:23:35,149
So, uh, if you're
not gonna let me in,

1308
01:23:35,182 --> 01:23:38,150
then at least
let me get somethin'...

1309
01:23:39,663 --> 01:23:41,834
in the car.

1310
01:23:41,871 --> 01:23:43,561
A present. I left it.

1311
01:23:49,134 --> 01:23:50,083
Ooh!

1312
01:24:17,103 --> 01:24:19,372
Aah! Aah! God!

1313
01:24:32,655 --> 01:24:34,411
Aah!

1314
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:37,550
Aah!

1315
01:24:37,582 --> 01:24:41,095
BLACKBIRD: You gotta know what
you're doing when you go in.

1316
01:24:42,830 --> 01:24:44,554
You gotta have it
figured out.

1317
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:49,412
Don't hang around.

1318
01:24:49,454 --> 01:24:50,883
Don't get interested.

1319
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:53,575
It's empty.

1320
01:24:55,951 --> 01:24:57,773
Then you
don't make mistakes.

1321
01:26:57,774 --> 01:26:58,774
