1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,416
Previously on The Bridge...

2
00:00:01,447 --> 00:00:02,229
Who are you?

3
00:00:02,221 --> 00:00:03,460
Marco Ruiz.

4
00:00:04,012 --> 00:00:05,443
Chihuahua State Police.

5
00:00:05,443 --> 00:00:06,726
Who are you?

6
00:00:06,968 --> 00:00:08,548
Sonya Cross.

7
00:00:08,916 --> 00:00:10,182
El Paso Homicide.

8
00:00:10,206 --> 00:00:11,363
Whoa!

9
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,580
Oh, shit!

10
00:00:18,363 --> 00:00:20,443
White arms, brown legs.

11
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:22,461
There were two women on the bridge.

12
00:00:22,485 --> 00:00:24,026
Two different women.

13
00:00:24,034 --> 00:00:25,613
- Cut in half?
- Yes.

14
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:27,615
Do you have a girl that
matches this description?

15
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:31,439
Cristina Fuentes is only one of 250 girls

16
00:00:31,486 --> 00:00:33,434
who disappeared last year.

17
00:00:33,457 --> 00:00:35,334
So you have a serial killer.

18
00:00:47,913 --> 00:00:50,811
There are five murders a year in El Paso.

19
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:52,938
In Juarez, thousands.

20
00:00:53,058 --> 00:00:56,082
Why is one dead white woman more important

21
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:58,561
than so many dead just across the bridge?

22
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:00,383
What's in there?

23
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:30,909
What is it?

24
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:32,017
It's a tunnel.

25
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:33,675
Where does it go?

26
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:34,763
Across.

27
00:01:34,782 --> 00:01:36,146
To Mexico.

28
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,937
Karl was running drugs?

29
00:01:40,343 --> 00:01:42,167
No, señora. Illegals.

30
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,028
I... I need to see it.

31
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:46,869
Cesar, I need to see it.

32
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:50,635
O____

33
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:54,733
W___

34
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:07,640
Who else knows about this?

35
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:09,105
Nobody.

36
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:11,781
Just Señor Karl and, uh...

37
00:02:12,296 --> 00:02:13,772
Who's on the other side?

38
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,136
I don't know.

39
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:18,671
I know this wasn't Karl's idea.

40
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:20,736
We should go back.

41
00:02:20,856 --> 00:02:23,032
It's not good to be down in here.

42
00:02:45,288 --> 00:02:47,114
What is that?

43
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,797
It's an altar.

44
00:02:53,646 --> 00:02:55,536
What is it doing here?

45
00:02:57,312 --> 00:02:58,977
Somebody died.

46
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:03,012
Here?

47
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:04,295
Sí, señora.

48
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,685
There was an accident.

49
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:22,264
Just get rid of it.

50
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,228
Board it up.

51
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:26,055
I don't think that's a good idea, señora.

52
00:03:26,112 --> 00:03:28,351
Please, Cesar, I can't
deal with this right now.

53

Let's go!

59
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:26,625
¡Vámonos!

60
00:04:30,873 --> 00:04:32,799
Fin del camino, folks.

61
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:34,115
This is as far as I go.

62
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:35,900
Adios, amigos.

63
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,867
T___

64
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:39,625
How 'bout this deal,

65
00:04:39,619 --> 00:04:41,822
I don't scatter your
brains all over the desert?

66
00:04:41,884 --> 00:04:42,998
¿Comprende?

67
00:04:43,486 --> 00:04:45,876
Do it the old-fashioned way and walk.

- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

80
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:27,018
What would you do if
you were locked in a car

81
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:28,007
with a bomb

82
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:30,353
and had five minutes to live?

83
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,882
He didn't have five minutes to live.

84
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,553
No, just imagine.

85
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:37,061
What would you do?

86
00:06:37,118 --> 00:06:38,669
Would you pray for a miracle?

87
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:40,947
Would you make right with your life?

88
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:42,893
I'd try to get out.

89
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:44,200
Yeah, but boom!

90
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:46,295
The bomb goes off.

91
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:50,512
Well, five minutes wouldn't make much

92
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,238
of a difference then, would they?

93
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:53,590
Hmm.

94
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:55,675
You want some?

95
00:06:56,657 --> 00:06:58,440
No. I want to work.

96
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,754
Okay, so...

97
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:01,743
let's go talk to Daniel Frye

98
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:03,283
You can't interrogate him.

99
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,010
No, I'm just gonna ask him some questions.

100
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,380
You can interrogate him.

101
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:08,388
Come on.

102
00:07:14,188 --> 00:07:16,227
Hey.

103
00:07:16,683 --> 00:07:17,691
Hey.

104
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:25,925
Detective Sonya Cross.

105
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:28,283
Oh, Detective Marco Ruiz.

106
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:29,972
You're the bitch on the phone.

107
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,351
Just doing my job.

108
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:34,740
I could've died.

109
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:36,185
But you didn't.

110
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:39,382
Your car was used in a double homicide.

111
00:07:40,314 --> 00:07:42,530
Yeah, and then the nut job stole my car

112
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,493
and put a bomb in it.

113
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:45,620
Why don't you guys go find him, huh?

114
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:47,723
We are trying.

115
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,012
Well, that's great.

116
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:50,532
Then I'm gonna leave.

117
00:07:50,582 --> 00:07:52,146
We searched your place.

118
00:07:56,152 --> 00:07:57,615
Sit down.

119
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,919
Come on. Sit down.

120
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:07,124
You can't do that.

121
00:08:07,306 --> 00:08:09,264
Well, we can and we did.

122
00:08:09,596 --> 00:08:12,067
And guess what, we found
your stash... the pills.

123
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:14,150
All right, what is this shit?

124
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:16,484
How did the killer

125
00:08:16,477 --> 00:08:18,098
get access to your car?

126
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,584
Let's see.

127
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,680
I, uh, worked until about midnight

128
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:28,357
and then I went over to the
bar and I had a couple pops

129
00:08:28,477 --> 00:08:30,504
and I went back to the
office and I crashed.

130
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,855
After that, I don't remember.

131
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,139
Why is that?

132
00:08:35,152 --> 00:08:36,629
Tequila.

133
00:08:38,845 --> 00:08:39,934
Okay.

134
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:41,929
So you've written about Judge Gates, right?

135
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,400
You already asked me that question.

136
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,618
We're asking again.

137
00:08:46,698 --> 00:08:47,953
immigration,

138
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:50,475
some professor grabbing another
professor at the university,

139
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:53,015
the cancer walk, the
Building Commission meetings,

140
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:54,085
Puppypalooza.

141
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:55,799
Whatever crap story my
editor wants to put me on,

142
00:08:55,837 --> 00:08:57,720
that's what I write about... it's my job.

143
00:08:58,007 --> 00:09:00,591
There are five murders a year in El Paso.

144
00:09:00,853 --> 00:09:03,084
In Juarez, thousands.

145
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,163
Why?

146
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:07,060
Why is one dead white woman more important

147
00:09:07,072 --> 00:09:09,944
than so many dead just across the bridge?

148
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,090
Recognize that?

149
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,355
Nope.

150
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:17,332
You two have your work cut out for you.

151
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:20,765
Why did he pick you, Frye?

152
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:22,932
Why don't you two figure that out

153
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:25,051
and then I'll write the story.

154
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:28,425
Huh? That's what I would
call a win-win situation.

155
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:38,366
Oh, uh, for the record, Officer,

156
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:42,032
your bedside manner sucks dog balls.

157
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:56,490
Why did you lie about searching his place?

158
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,449
We needed him to talk, right?

159
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,081
Lying's bad.

160
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:01,484
He's not going to trust us now.

161
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:04,129
He's a reporter... you
can't trust 'em anyway.

162
00:10:05,093 --> 00:10:06,713
They lie.

163
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:08,551
What's that?

164
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:12,719
Sorry about the drama,

165
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:15,798
but it is hard to make
oneself heard these days.

166
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,751
Cristina Fuentes died 14 months ago.

167
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:21,985
Nobody investigated.

168
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,605
Nobody cared.

169
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:25,820
Just another dead girl.

170
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,428
Another pink cross,

171
00:10:27,446 --> 00:10:29,405
another victim of the border.

172
00:10:31,595 --> 00:10:34,498
Well, ain't that a
well-stacked brick of cow shit.

173
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:36,350
He's only getting started.

174
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:38,145
Yeah, looks like it.

175
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,291
I'm going to Juarez, Hank.

176
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:41,592
What for, Sonya?

177
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:43,913
It's where the case is, and...

178
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:46,203
No, that's not a good idea.

179
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:52,729
I'm going.

180
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:23,925
N___

181
00:12:24,162 --> 00:12:25,927
P___

182
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,080
She's here with me.

183
00:12:29,524 --> 00:12:31,520
Sonya sends her regards.

184
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:36,350
Okay. Bye.

185
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:40,322
My wife says hi.

186
00:12:41,148 --> 00:12:42,475
I didn't say hello.

187
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:43,708
I don't know her.

188
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:45,278
No, you will meet her.

189
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,670
She's very curious about you.

190
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,103
Why?

191
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:54,363
She wants to know how we're getting along.

192
00:12:55,796 --> 00:12:57,441
How are we?

193
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,545
Good.

194
00:13:02,622 --> 00:13:03,936
So far.

195
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,478
Is that why she called?

196
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:08,566
No.

197
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,427
Doesn't she know you're working?

198
00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:15,417
Yes.

199
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:19,291
She just wanted to hear my voice.

200
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:34,582
T___

201
00:13:39,393 --> 00:13:41,364
Not everything is in the system.

202
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:44,755
Some stuff we just keep in the boxes.

203
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,352
Let's see what we have here in this file.

204
00:13:47,614 --> 00:13:49,228
It's a motel key.

205
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:51,543
You've studied the case?

206
00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:53,240
It's not my job.

207
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:56,249
It's okay.

208
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:03,719
The other victims were cartel killings.

209
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:06,666
Yup, tortured, shot

210
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:08,587
and dumped.

211
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,383
Just business.

212
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:13,374
The men were all killed at the same time.

213
00:14:13,405 --> 00:14:15,157
Cristina a month before.

214
00:14:16,252 --> 00:14:17,559
Okay.

215
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:20,826
What's in the box that's not in the system?

216
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:25,681
Rafa Galvan,

217
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,821
Fausto Galvan's brother.

218
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:34,003
So, there was another body?

219
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:40,629
His body was taken from the morgue.

220
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,886
And his name...

221
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,352
erased from the system.

222
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:46,397
23 became 22.

223
00:14:48,317 --> 00:14:50,463
I'm sorry. How does that happen?

224
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:52,972
Galvan made a call.

225
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:58,440
He didn't want his rivals
to have the satisfaction.

226
00:14:58,828 --> 00:14:59,998
So, you buried it?

227
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:01,800
Not me.

228
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:04,822
Captain Alejandro Robles.

229
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:07,950
You must be Detective Sonya Cross.

230
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,365
Yes.

231
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:14,462
Welcome to Juarez, Detective.

232
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:21,789
Oh.

233
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:24,641
How are they hanging, Detective?

234
00:15:25,242 --> 00:15:26,909
Muy bien. Muy bien, Capitán.

235
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,041
Straight and true.

236
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,470
That's not what I've heard.

237
00:15:32,784 --> 00:15:33,522
Oh.

238
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:36,394
Perhaps you can show us
how the Americans do it.

239
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:37,426
Oh, no, Capitán.

240
00:15:37,426 --> 00:15:39,678
The task force is only for Cristina's case.

241
00:15:39,798 --> 00:15:42,418
I know what the task
force is for, Detective.

242
00:15:42,462 --> 00:15:45,033
The Chihuahua State Police
doesn't promote fools.

243
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,472
Hmm.

244
00:15:48,374 --> 00:15:50,895
Why wasn't this case investigated?

245
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:53,586
What case?

246
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:58,279
23 cartel members

247
00:15:58,298 --> 00:16:01,294
dumped in the same house
as Cristina Fuentes.

248
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:04,085
22.

249
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,900
Not 23.

250
00:16:07,476 --> 00:16:09,127
Isn't that right, Detective?

251
00:16:09,153 --> 00:16:10,285
Sí señor.

252
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,982
Okay, well, why wasn't it investigated?

253
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,027
I___ Sí señor.

254
00:16:20,234 --> 00:16:21,685
Oh.

255
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:24,888
Nice meeting you, Detective.

256
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,402
W___

257
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:39,309
No, señor.

258
00:16:39,322 --> 00:16:41,142
A___

259
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,252
She's only interested in the girl.

260
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:48,105
- Y___.
- Yes, sir.

261
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:51,541
K___

262
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:52,616
- Sí, señor.
- Understand?

263
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:53,498
Sí.

264
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,031
You can't come in here and
ask those kind of questions.

265
00:17:09,882 --> 00:17:11,371
We're investigating a murder.

266
00:17:11,384 --> 00:17:13,949
No, no, no, no, it doesn't
work like that down here!

267
00:17:18,116 --> 00:17:20,031
Is this about Fausto Galvan?

268
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,677
You're going to get me killed.

269
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:24,492
I have a family.

270
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:27,026
A man like Fausto Galvan can take my wife

271
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:28,697
and my kids out into the desert,

272
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:31,607
burn 'em alive and make me watch.

273
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:33,228
What does he have to do with this case?

274
00:17:33,265 --> 00:17:35,036
¡Nada! ¡Nothing!

275
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:36,969
Why was her body dumped in that house?

276
00:17:36,982 --> 00:17:39,060
That's it, that's it. I'm... I'm done here.

277
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,662
I'm... I'm taking you back.

278
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:42,958
Come on, let's go.

279
00:17:43,002 --> 00:17:44,891
Come on, let's go, I said!

280
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,725
Y___

281
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:34,404
- L___.
- No!

282
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:35,586
A___

283
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:37,394
P___.

284
00:19:03,884 --> 00:19:06,480
W___

285
00:19:07,738 --> 00:19:09,132
Y___

286
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:10,904
- Sí.
- W___

287
00:19:16,147 --> 00:19:18,168
Y___.

288
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,476
Un gringo.

289
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:21,297
H___.

290
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:22,667
¿Que?

291
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,669
T___.

292
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:26,702
B___.

293
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,815
T___.

294
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:32,020
- A___.?
- No.

295
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:34,673
A___.

296
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:41,205
- Are you sure this is right?
- Verbatim.

297
00:19:41,325 --> 00:19:42,143
Wow.

298
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,014
You stumbled into a story, Daniel.

299
00:19:44,026 --> 00:19:46,115
- No shit.
- What was it like?

300
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:47,598
What do you think it
was like? It was awesome.

301
00:19:47,642 --> 00:19:49,425
So, why did this nut job pick you?

302
00:19:49,457 --> 00:19:51,947
I like to think he's a loyal reader.

303
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:54,412
Okay, the police are gonna be watching you.

304
00:19:54,412 --> 00:19:55,119
They already are.

305
00:19:55,131 --> 00:19:57,009
We're gonna have to be
very careful with this.

306
00:19:57,046 --> 00:19:59,625
Come on, grow a pair.
Run the story. It's good.

307
00:20:00,745 --> 00:20:03,434
You know, I haven't seen
you at any meetings lately.

308
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:05,820
Just been going to different meetings.

309
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:07,679
You're a shitty liar.

310
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:10,526
Hey, uh, Mendez? Come here.

311
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:14,417
Okay, you're gonna be
working this story with Frye.

312
00:20:14,424 --> 00:20:15,300
Hey, bullshit.

313
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:16,808
- I am not working with some cub reporter...
- Spare me the résumé recital,

314
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:17,990
Daniel, please.

315
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:19,786
You're gonna download the story to Mendez,

316
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:22,282
you're gonna write the main story
about the killer's manifesto,

317
00:20:22,312 --> 00:20:23,464
without explaining how we got it.

318
00:20:23,482 --> 00:20:24,058
Of course.

319
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:26,323
You're gonna write the
sidebar about what it was like

320
00:20:26,322 --> 00:20:27,768
to be in that car.

321
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,838
Did you piss your pants?

322
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:30,496
You know, that sort of a thing?

323
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,547
Okay?

324
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:36,090
File anything over 850,

325
00:20:36,096 --> 00:20:38,755
I'm gonna cut it down to size myself, okay?

326
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:41,515
You have one hour. Go!

327
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:44,349
Car is clean.

328
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,334
We still have nothing on the
power outage on the bridge.

329
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,174
Cooper's traced the judge's
credit card movements.

330
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:51,694
We got her buying gas.

331
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,501
Security camera.

332
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:57,744
How did it go with you and Marco?

333
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,378
Good.

334
00:21:02,268 --> 00:21:04,533
Good in as, you're working with him?

335
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:10,083
He's mad at me.

336
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,904
How come?

337
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:15,239
I ask too many questions?

338
00:21:16,477 --> 00:21:18,110
Yes, you do.

339
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:24,872
Does Carmen ever call you for no reason?

340
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:28,445
Yeah, she does sometimes.

341
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,928
His wife called

342
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,580
when we were working...

343
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,331
just to hear his voice.

344
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:37,541
It seems like such a waste of time...

345
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:40,155
I got him.

346
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:42,308
You got... Oh.

347
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:44,210
We know Judge Gates

348
00:21:44,222 --> 00:21:46,419
- stopped for gas in Sonora, right?
- Right.

349
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,059
She goes inside.

350
00:21:49,335 --> 00:21:50,761
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

351
00:21:51,124 --> 00:21:52,776
He was waiting in the backseat.

352
00:21:53,032 --> 00:21:54,140
He must have followed her.

353
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:55,666
Play that bit again.

354
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,173
Excuse me. Miss Charlotte,

355
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:03,950
there's a man here to see you.

356
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,420
I'm busy.

357
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:07,698
He's not going away.

358
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:18,677
Monte P. Flagman, Esquire.

359
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:21,677
- I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.
- Thank you.

360
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,185
It's a lenticular.

361
00:22:24,436 --> 00:22:25,743
Stars and Stripes?

362
00:22:25,863 --> 00:22:28,240
Turn it, you get the Lone Star?

363
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:33,182
My wife insisted on making her
three bean salad for the wake.

364
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:38,244
Looks like a cyclone blew through here.

365
00:22:38,938 --> 00:22:41,022
You ever seen a real one up close?

366
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,148
It's a hell of a thing.

367
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:46,171
I'm sorry. How do you know my husband?

368
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:48,111
Did some legal work for him.

369
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,339
He never mentioned your name.

370
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:54,969
This is about the tunnel, isn't it?

371
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:56,320
Yes, ma'am.

372
00:22:56,868 --> 00:22:58,722
I want to make you
aware of some obligations

373
00:22:58,741 --> 00:23:01,111
- Karl had to my client.
- Karl's dead.

374
00:23:05,221 --> 00:23:07,174
You've come a long way since meeting Karl.

375
00:23:07,242 --> 00:23:09,989
Waiting tables in Miami,
or was it the Keys?

376
00:23:10,109 --> 00:23:11,659
It was Tampa.

377
00:23:15,056 --> 00:23:16,757
Technically speaking,

378
00:23:16,877 --> 00:23:18,716
this is still Karl's ranch.

379
00:23:19,104 --> 00:23:21,725
It could take a while for the estate
to settle out with the lawyers.

380
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:24,653
Then there's Karl's
daughter Katie to consider.

381
00:23:26,017 --> 00:23:28,182
Those probate hearings
can be kind of tricky.

382
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,278
What's your point?

383
00:23:31,153 --> 00:23:33,068
Karl had good taste in horses.

384
00:23:33,105 --> 00:23:34,263
What'd he call this one?

385
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,027
Rio.

386
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,042
Those bloodlines cost money.

387
00:23:40,112 --> 00:23:42,677
Horse like that'll cost
you a hundred grand, easy.

388
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:44,736
My client gave it to him.

389
00:23:45,468 --> 00:23:47,050
What is your client's name?

390
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,027
I'm not at liberty to say.

391
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,213
I simply want to point out
there is a prior obligation

392
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:56,223
between your late husband and my client.

393
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,393
Okay.

394
00:23:58,801 --> 00:24:00,364
See, I don't know if Karl told you,

395
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:02,341
but he took a real bath in the crash.

396
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,169
Kind of got out over his skis, as they say.

397
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:09,299
I just wanted to introduce myself.

398
00:24:11,808 --> 00:24:13,347
You have my card.

399
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,698
Y___.

400
00:24:50,729 --> 00:24:53,638

401
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,284

Y___?

404
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:15,578
Get out!

405
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:18,744
I___.n.

406
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:21,196

407
00:25:24,838 --> 00:25:27,285

F___.

414
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,625
H___?

415
00:27:38,745 --> 00:27:40,133
1___.

416
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:42,836
Y___?

417
00:27:43,343 --> 00:27:44,644
C___.

418
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,840
H___?

419
00:28:00,403 --> 00:28:01,835
A___,

420
00:28:01,955 --> 00:28:03,363
o___.

421
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:05,039

423
00:28:07,867 --> 00:28:09,093
S___?

424
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:11,289
Y___?

425
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:13,180
T___.

426
00:28:13,493 --> 00:28:14,669
Hmm?

427
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:20,675
S___.

428
00:28:57,828 --> 00:28:58,435
Hi.

429
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,255
- You waiting for someone?
- No.

430
00:29:03,414 --> 00:29:05,172
Can I buy you a drink?

431
00:29:05,234 --> 00:29:05,960
No.

432
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:13,668
Okay.

433
00:29:26,194 --> 00:29:27,564
Hey.

434
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,829
Why'd you walk away?

435
00:29:30,173 --> 00:29:32,219
I just didn't want a drink.

436
00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:35,416
Okay.

437
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,214
Want to have sex with me?

438
00:29:38,752 --> 00:29:41,010
We can go back to my place.

439
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:46,754
What, is this some kind of joke?

440
00:29:47,173 --> 00:29:49,473
- No. Why, you married?
- No.

441
00:29:49,486 --> 00:29:51,807
Want to have sex, yes or no?

442
00:29:54,947 --> 00:29:56,092
Yes.

443
00:29:56,307 --> 00:29:57,444
Good.

444
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,653
You're late again, Steven.

445
00:30:33,773 --> 00:30:35,308
Yes, I know that.

446
00:30:36,147 --> 00:30:37,323
Traffic.

447
00:30:37,443 --> 00:30:39,050
They found that judge up

448
00:30:39,081 --> 00:30:40,820
on the Bridge of Americas last night.

449
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:41,884
Oh, yeah.

450
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,472
Yeah, I saw that.

451
00:30:43,473 --> 00:30:44,781
It's just terrible.

452
00:30:46,238 --> 00:30:48,053
Well, I don't know.

453
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:49,711
Maybe she had it coming.

454
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,807
Nobody has that coming.

455
00:30:51,813 --> 00:30:52,927
You don't mean that, Steven.

456
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:54,725
I know. No, you're right.

457
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:57,439
I guess that's just my politics.

458
00:30:58,605 --> 00:30:59,875
What's new?

459
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:02,496
Valentina's got her court date.

460
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:04,148
Big John's talking about the river

461
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,087
and Emmy Lou again and not taking his meds.

462
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:07,394
Mrs. Nelson wandered off.

463
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,208
Toilet's leaking.

464
00:31:08,227 --> 00:31:09,922
Felipe found a dead rat in the cooler,

465
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:11,274
another in the storeroom.

466
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,783
When did she come in?

467
00:31:14,571 --> 00:31:15,839
Night before last.

468
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,574
Refused to see the nurse.

469
00:31:17,612 --> 00:31:20,684
Possible 51-50. Bowl of
soup and she was gone.

470
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,272
What happened to your hand?

471
00:31:22,905 --> 00:31:23,919
It's nothing.

472
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,119
You go on home now.

473
00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:27,204
You get some rest.

474
00:31:28,562 --> 00:31:30,501
Make sure Felipe sets rat traps.

475
00:31:30,505 --> 00:31:32,203
I will set them myself.

476
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:56,027
Drink first?

477
00:31:57,272 --> 00:31:58,567
Okay.

478
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,685
Have you done this before?

479
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:53,412
Yeah. You?

480
00:32:53,532 --> 00:32:55,623
Yeah.

481
00:32:55,743 --> 00:32:58,419
Okay, let's go.

482
00:33:05,094 --> 00:33:08,532
Faster! Fast!

483
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:13,205
Oh!

484
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:18,352
Hey...

485
00:34:21,647 --> 00:34:24,319
- D___.
- Gracias.

486
00:34:24,713 --> 00:34:26,133

00:34:26,253 --> 00:34:28,542

492

Bien.

493
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,192
What the hell is that?

494
00:35:36,475 --> 00:35:38,700
- Work.
- Work? What do you do?

495
00:35:38,975 --> 00:35:41,359
Detective, El Paso PD.

496
00:35:45,939 --> 00:35:47,634
You want me to go?

497
00:35:50,368 --> 00:35:51,869
You want to stay?

498
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:53,715
You can sleep.

499
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:56,468
Who is that?

500
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:58,401
Corpse.

501
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:00,884
Yeah,

502
00:36:01,842 --> 00:36:03,480
- maybe I should go.
- Okay.

503
00:36:07,797 --> 00:36:09,117
Here you go.

504
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:11,982
Thank you.

517
00:37:14,305 --> 00:37:16,670
A___?

518
00:37:17,729 --> 00:37:19,392
- Sonya?
- Hmm.

519
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:20,568
¿Que?

520
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:23,133
S___?

521
00:37:23,652 --> 00:37:25,029
Eh.

522
00:37:26,292 --> 00:37:27,875
S___.

523
00:37:28,857 --> 00:37:30,784
A___.

524
00:37:30,822 --> 00:37:32,692
I___.

525
00:37:33,149 --> 00:37:35,414
N___.

526
00:37:45,576 --> 00:37:47,102
I___.

527
00:37:48,823 --> 00:37:52,133
W___? H___?

528
00:37:52,253 --> 00:37:54,336
- I___...
- I___.

529
00:37:59,954 --> 00:38:02,581
- A___?
- Sí.

530
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,409
H___?

531
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:08,161
W___.

532
00:38:09,131 --> 00:38:11,120
W___.

533
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,323
I___.

534
00:38:22,957 --> 00:38:24,922
W___.

535
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,305
There's something there.

536
00:38:47,361 --> 00:38:48,623
Going back with Marco.

537
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:50,201
Yeah, there's a bunch of rocks there.

538
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:52,003
Did you stare at those
photographs all night?

539
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:54,147
Not all night. I had sex.

540
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:58,796
I don't need to know that, Sonya.

541
00:39:00,391 --> 00:39:02,925
Did you at least dance
with the fella first?

542
00:39:03,045 --> 00:39:05,309
Hey, boss, you see that yet?

543
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:12,061
It's the killer's message verbatim.

544
00:39:16,823 --> 00:39:18,693
How'd he get this?

545
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,235
I played it for him.

546
00:39:24,183 --> 00:39:25,643
Cooper?

547
00:39:25,675 --> 00:39:27,182
What can I do you for, Hank?

548
00:39:27,183 --> 00:39:29,610
I'm sorry, am... am I
interrupting your snack time?

549
00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:31,544
I'm just topping off
my good bacteria, boss.

550
00:39:31,563 --> 00:39:33,671
You got good and bad
bacteria in your stomach,

551
00:39:33,696 --> 00:39:34,641
and they're at war.

552
00:39:34,761 --> 00:39:36,762
Yeah, well, now they're in the trash.

553
00:39:36,831 --> 00:39:38,526
I want you to follow this reporter.

554
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:40,204
Our killer chose him for a reason.

555
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,042
I want you on him.

556
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:43,200
Like a hair on a biscuit.

557
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:45,972
I'm sorry, Hank.

558
00:39:48,193 --> 00:39:49,934
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

559
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,706
Sonya, it's okay.

560
00:39:52,762 --> 00:39:55,565
Just, um, shh... It's okay.

561
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:57,555
- Just check with me next time.
- Okay.

562
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:20,167
W___.

563
00:40:20,674 --> 00:40:21,500
N___.

564
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:25,273
T___.

565
00:40:28,145 --> 00:40:29,734
T___.

566
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,921
What the hell...?

567
00:41:24,386 --> 00:41:26,123
Of course, I saw you pass by.

568
00:41:26,142 --> 00:41:27,343
What is this?

569
00:41:27,463 --> 00:41:29,199
Coyote.

570
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:30,840
It was disturbing the crime scene.

571
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:31,779
So you killed it?

572
00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:32,798
Yes, ma'am.

573
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,714
Scare off other vermin,
predators, what have you.

574
00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:38,123
Yeah, can't have the
crime scene contaminated.

575
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:39,844
What are you doing here?

576
00:41:39,844 --> 00:41:41,233
I was on a stakeout.

577
00:41:41,258 --> 00:41:42,515
A stakeout?

578
00:41:42,515 --> 00:41:43,379
Yes, sir.

579
00:41:43,423 --> 00:41:45,587
Killers sometimes revisit
their crime scenes...

580
00:41:45,593 --> 00:41:46,907
I read it in a book.

581
00:41:47,186 --> 00:41:48,290
So I've been watching.

582
00:41:48,553 --> 00:41:50,560
Yeah. Good work, Deputy.

583
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:51,643
Yeah.

584
00:41:51,763 --> 00:41:52,938
As you can see, I...

585
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,671
preserved the field of evidence.

586
00:41:54,677 --> 00:41:55,991
The blood's intact.

587
00:41:56,111 --> 00:41:58,093
Thank you. Gracias.

588
00:41:58,131 --> 00:41:59,964
I understand a task force is imminent.

589
00:42:00,014 --> 00:42:00,715
Yes.

590
00:42:00,835 --> 00:42:02,654
I'd like to be part of it, being

591
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:04,099
I was first one on the scene.

592
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:06,282
We'll keep you in mind.

593
00:42:07,045 --> 00:42:09,079
You okay?

594
00:42:09,123 --> 00:42:13,152
Uh, it's, uh, oh, migraine coming on.

595
00:42:14,147 --> 00:42:16,262
Whoo! It's a head buster.

596
00:42:22,787 --> 00:42:24,045
What's that?

597
00:42:24,402 --> 00:42:25,941
A bead.

598
00:42:36,702 --> 00:42:39,061
Don't worry, Jose... I'm gonna bury 'em.

599
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:41,351
Railroad doesn't have a leg to stand on.

600
00:42:41,545 --> 00:42:43,765
Now, you go home, take you some ibuprofen,

601
00:42:43,885 --> 00:42:46,913
get that pretty wife of yours to
rub some liniment on your neck.

602
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:49,972
Miss Millwright.

603
00:42:50,041 --> 00:42:51,993
I see you found us okay.

604
00:42:53,401 --> 00:42:56,479
This is three bean salad.

605
00:42:58,694 --> 00:43:00,064
And this is money.

606
00:43:00,184 --> 00:43:01,760
And I don't want it.

607
00:43:06,866 --> 00:43:09,763
I was a hostess, not a waitress.

608
00:43:09,982 --> 00:43:12,096
I stand corrected.

609
00:43:13,936 --> 00:43:15,626
Ma'am.

610
00:43:21,876 --> 00:43:23,759
W___.

611
00:43:23,879 --> 00:43:26,380
- W___?
- ¡Vengan!

612
00:43:29,766 --> 00:43:31,180
I___.

613
00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:45,857
D___.

614
00:43:49,423 --> 00:43:52,414
I___.

615
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:55,267
N___.

616
00:43:56,249 --> 00:43:57,463
N___.

617
00:43:58,644 --> 00:44:00,959
A___?

618
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:03,218
___.

619
00:44:13,426 --> 00:44:14,525
It's a bead.

620
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:16,579
He left it for us to find.

621
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,462
There's a man here.

622
00:44:18,478 --> 00:44:20,990
He says he's responsible for the message.

623
00:44:27,911 --> 00:44:29,337
Can we help you?

624
00:44:32,722 --> 00:44:34,173
Excuse me.

625
00:44:35,545 --> 00:44:37,176
Sir.

626
00:44:38,703 --> 00:44:40,391
Good to finally meet you.

627
00:44:41,018 --> 00:44:43,414
- Don't move!
- Show me your hands!

628
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:44,528
Let's see your hands!

629
00:44:44,584 --> 00:44:45,460
What's the matter?

630
00:44:47,787 --> 00:44:48,813
Don't move!

631
00:44:53,937 --> 00:44:56,014
I do over 33 impressions.

632
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,877
Community theater.

633
00:44:57,878 --> 00:44:59,881
Maybe you remember me as Falstaff?

634
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:01,164
No.

635
00:45:01,678 --> 00:45:02,903
You're an actor?

636
00:45:03,898 --> 00:45:06,625
When I saw the paper,
I couldn't believe it.

637
00:45:06,632 --> 00:45:08,540
Who asked you to record the message?

638
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,510
I don't know.

639
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:12,569
The script came with a note as
to how they wanted it recorded.

640
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:14,859
No name, just a P.O. box return.

641
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:17,644
And you didn't think the
whole thing was strange?

642
00:45:18,194 --> 00:45:19,270
The letter said that it was

643
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:20,825
for an art performance or something.

644
00:45:20,853 --> 00:45:22,061
How'd you get paid?

645
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,125
Money order, if I remember right.

646
00:45:24,182 --> 00:45:25,270
Do you still have the script

647
00:45:25,283 --> 00:45:26,415
and letter with the P.O. box?

648
00:45:26,428 --> 00:45:27,322
No.

649
00:45:28,067 --> 00:45:29,168
Why not?

650
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,789
It's been a long time.

651
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:34,655
Recorded it three years ago.

652
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,233
Howdy.

653
00:45:51,046 --> 00:45:52,654
Give it.

654
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,709
Yeah, the car matches, the time matches.

655
00:45:58,197 --> 00:45:59,843
It's the dude.

656
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:05,348
He said he's in Juarez for the señoritas.

657
00:46:06,011 --> 00:46:08,828
So, you, uh, got your address there, amigo.

658
00:46:10,554 --> 00:46:12,332
You know, I had no
reason not to believe him.

659
00:46:14,878 --> 00:46:16,692
We're good, right?

660
00:46:21,716 --> 00:46:22,886
Hey.

661
00:46:24,569 --> 00:46:26,909
- Want some?
- No.

662
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:28,786
Aw, come on, you've earned it.

663
00:46:29,543 --> 00:46:31,863
Front page of the local newspaper.

664
00:46:31,983 --> 00:46:33,415
Wires'll pick up.

665
00:46:33,535 --> 00:46:34,810
You think?

666
00:46:36,051 --> 00:46:38,434
It's good. It's good stuff.

667
00:46:39,861 --> 00:46:41,250
You sure?

668
00:46:41,845 --> 00:46:43,389
I'm okay. Thank you.

669
00:46:44,228 --> 00:46:47,073
Hey, sorry about being such a dick earlier.

670
00:46:47,249 --> 00:46:49,032
Why are you such a dick?

671
00:46:49,945 --> 00:46:51,972
I was born that way.

672
00:46:58,578 --> 00:46:59,911
Shit. Hey...

673
00:47:01,407 --> 00:47:03,796
How much you want to bet that's a cop?

674
00:47:04,711 --> 00:47:06,155
With that moustache.

675
00:47:06,174 --> 00:47:07,938
That hat.

676
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,425
That's weird.

677
00:47:16,511 --> 00:47:18,458
- This is Frye.
- Hello, Daniel.

678
00:47:18,578 --> 00:47:20,196
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

679
00:47:20,233 --> 00:47:21,854
It's the killer... give me a pen.

680
00:47:21,892 --> 00:47:22,555
Pen, pen...

681
00:47:22,555 --> 00:47:23,658
Uh-huh, yeah, I'm listening.

682
00:47:23,778 --> 00:47:24,877
No, just wait one... one sec.

683
00:47:24,878 --> 00:47:25,977
Okay?

684
00:47:25,978 --> 00:47:27,622
Okay, I'm ready.

685
00:47:28,292 --> 00:47:31,370
Three, one, six, zero, six,

686
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:35,549
zero, two, five, one, zero, six,

687
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:40,065
zero, two, six, three, zero, six.

688
00:47:40,111 --> 00:47:41,677
Okay, is that... is that it?

689
00:47:41,678 --> 00:47:42,949
Hello?

690
00:47:44,245 --> 00:47:45,421
That was the killer.

691
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,147
What did he say?

692
00:47:46,172 --> 00:47:46,948
He told me to pay attention

693
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:48,387
and then he gave me this number.

694
00:47:48,925 --> 00:47:50,139
Look, three, one, six, zero, six.

695
00:47:50,176 --> 00:47:51,578
Code just keeps going.

696
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:53,691
Give me the pen.

697
00:47:55,532 --> 00:47:57,240
What the hell does it mean?

698
00:47:58,516 --> 00:47:59,986
It's a GPS coordinate.

699
00:48:00,024 --> 00:48:01,156
Longitude and latitude.

700
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,364
How do you know that?

701
00:48:02,484 --> 00:48:04,528
Father was a surveyor for Pemex.

702
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,929
No shit.

703
00:48:06,248 --> 00:48:07,293
See?

704
00:48:07,413 --> 00:48:10,303
East of town, down by the border.

705
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,104
What do you think you're doing?

706
00:48:40,052 --> 00:48:43,312
Buenos días... señorita.

707
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:45,051
Buenos días, my ass.

708
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:46,184
I'm calling the cops.

709
00:49:00,072 --> 00:49:01,424
Where is Steven Linder?

710
00:49:01,544 --> 00:49:02,725
I don't know.

711
00:49:15,388 --> 00:49:17,140
He took something from me.

712
00:49:18,691 --> 00:49:20,631
I want it back.

713
00:49:22,564 --> 00:49:25,717
God have mercy on you.

714
00:49:26,155 --> 00:49:27,412
Maybe.

715
00:50:05,214 --> 00:50:06,491
It's almost dark.

716
00:50:06,491 --> 00:50:08,280
Better for the story.

717
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,501
"Two Reporters Lured to Their Death"?

718
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:12,447
Hopefully one of us lives.

719
00:50:12,497 --> 00:50:14,330
The other one can write the story.

720
00:50:15,049 --> 00:50:16,882
I smell a Pulitzer.

721
00:50:18,065 --> 00:50:19,660
So, what's your deal?

722
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,931
What are you, uh, community college?

723
00:50:21,968 --> 00:50:23,076
You write a blog or something?

724
00:50:23,113 --> 00:50:24,508
U.T. Austin.

725
00:50:24,628 --> 00:50:26,161
Boyfriend?

726
00:50:26,761 --> 00:50:28,426
What, you want to get to know me now?

727
00:50:28,419 --> 00:50:30,309
Not really.

728
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:33,005
Oh, hey, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

729
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,582
What?

730
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,603
It says, "Go right."

731
00:51:02,285 --> 00:51:04,106
It's just down here.

732
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:06,277
Down where?

733
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:12,733
Holy shit!

734
00:51:18,915 --> 00:51:20,779
Oh, my God.

735
00:51:36,701 --> 00:51:38,328
Aw, hell.

736
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,062
Dangerous crossing.

737
00:51:41,281 --> 00:51:43,559
The fence forces them out here.

738
00:51:44,172 --> 00:51:45,961
Nine bodies.

739
00:52:24,014 --> 00:52:25,434
It's him.

740
00:52:47,054 --> 00:52:56,026
