Hello, boys.

17
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:05,290
How you doing? You all right?
Got you a cup of tea here. You fancy it?

00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,249
Yeah? No?

The old Dagenham Anglia?

Naught to 60 in, what, 40 minutes,
something like that?

Phwoar! It's a bit of you, that, innit,
all black and cramped and very sharp.

This one's really milky, for you.

Why don't you fuck off, Kray?

24
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,457
All right, I will. You know,
I wouldn't want to keep you,

you gotta lock away, eh, Nipper?

I suppose you just hold it in,
don't you?

All right, then, have a lovely day.
Cheer up. It's nearly Christmas.

29
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,999
Sorry about that.

30
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,707
Where's me driver?
Where's Frank?

31
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,540
- Can't get out of bed in the morning, Reg.
- You what?

32
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,415
He ain't here. He ain't showed up.
His heart ain't in it.

All right, OK.
Well, let's go get him, then, shall we?

34
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,081
- Where is he? On Ormsby Street, yeah?
- Yeah. Jump in, I'll give you a lift.

35
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:01,874
Nah, you're all right. I'm gonna walk.
It's a lovely day for it.

Don't forget this lot.
They're very important.

- All right, Reg?

44
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,457
I was going to knock on your door.
Me mum said you left that in the kitchen.

45
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:26,832
- Oh, I did.
- That yours?

46
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,332
- It is. Oh, thanks ever so much.
- Not a problem. You're welcome.

They won't talk to a policeman,
but they'll kiss a gangster. Eh?

50
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,207
The filthy cockney bastards.

51
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,915
How about we clean your car for you?

52
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,374
You get the bumper
and I'll get the lights.

53
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,207
Frank about?

54
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,999
Frank!

55
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:14,999
Who are you?

56
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,165
Frances. Frank's sister.

57
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,874
Hang about, I recognise you.
See, I recognise you.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,749
You was a little bit younger then.
You got all grown up, didn't you?

59
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,124
It happens.

60
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,457
What have you got there?

61
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,915
A sweet.

62
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,457
That's not any sweet, is it?
That's a lemon sherbet, that is.

63
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,665
Mind if I have a crack?

64
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,124
(Chuckling) All right.

65
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,207
Thank you.

66
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,457
Oh, that's nice, innit?

67
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,415
(Crunching)

68
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,499
- You're not supposed to chew it.
- No?

69
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,583
How else am I supposed to get
to the sherbetty bit?

70
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,749
- By being patient.
- Nah!

71
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,624
Being patient doesn't get you
what you want, does it?

72
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,999
(Window opens)

73
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,624
Half a minute, Reg. Right down.

74
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,582
- Is he in trouble?
- Yeah, he is.

75
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:13,499
Will you go out with me?
I'll go easy on him if you do.

76
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,999
All right.

77
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,999
But not for that reason.

78
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,457
Saturday night.

79
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,165
(Mrs Shea) Who are you talking to?
You're half-dressed,

80
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,499
talking to a man in the door.
What's wrong with you, Frances?

81
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,499
Get back in the kitchen,
finish them dishes.

82
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,332
Hey, this is yours.

83
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,207
Thank you.

84
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,957
Oversleep again, Frank, all right,

85
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,874
and it's back to the cheese shop
or the fish shop

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,957
or whatever shop it was
you come from.

87
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,499
(Frank) Print.

88
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,874
Print shop.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,624
Oh, yeah?

90
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,415
You'll be back to the fucking shit shop,
you understand?

91
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,415
- Yeah.
- What does your sister do?

92
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:07,249
She goes to one of those, uh,
Pitman Colleges.

93
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,249
You know, typing, shorthand.

94
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,415
- Yeah?
- Yep.

95
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,332
She's got a bit of class, mate.
She's very elegant.

96
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,749
Where you been hiding her?

97
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,582
She been away.

98
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,540
She's a bit, uh, fragile, Reg.

99
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,207
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

100
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,332
- All right.
- (Donoghue) Stop here, Frank.

101
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,624
Five minutes. Won't be long.

102
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,749
How long you reckon it'll take
for him to twig, Albie?

103
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,165
Little bit of cat and mouse.

(Frances) 'Nipper Read was the copper
on the Krays' case.

You know?

114
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,540
I was drilling my eyes
into the back of his head.

115
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:50,790
Till I'm not even thinking it anymore.
I'm not... I'm not even thinking.

116
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,624
I'm broadcasting it.

117
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,082
Until he turns around
and you know what he says? He says...

118
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:04,457
"Hey, Ron, do you fancy my sausage?
I've got... I've got no appetite for it."

119
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,415
Interesting.

What's that?

When you say
you want to "raspberry" this man,

132

I'm not sure of your vernacular.
What do you mean?

(Big Pat) Raspberry ripple, cripple.

You want to cripple someone?

135

- Yep, that's right.
- And why is that?

136
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:55,499
Because, Doctor,
I'm afraid he may not be inclined

137
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,999
to provide a favourable evaluation
of my employer.

138

And who's your employer?

139
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,874
Ronnie Kray.

140
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,249
Is there hope, Doctor?

141

Excuse me a moment.

Ronald Kray possesses
possibly the soundest mind I've seen

in 26 years of psychiatric practice.

146
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:28,832
In my view, to keep him here
would be a waste of public resources.

(Doctor) Mr Kray.

151
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,026
I hope you know what you're doing.

Yeah, I know what I'm doing.
I'm going back to London, gonna take the...

Your brother has no real idea
who or what he is.

Nor does he trust his own senses.

155
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,457
I've never seen a man
so desperately in need of reassurance.

156
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,124
We all like a nice little compliment
now and again, don't we?

157
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,457
Your brother is arbitrary,
violent and psychopathic,

158
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,790
probably paranoid schizophrenic.

159
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:17,624
What I'm trying to tell you
is that he's off his fucking rocker.

160
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,249
It's called Stemetil.

161
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,374
You need to give it to your brother
twice a day

162
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,832
or there's going to be serious trouble.

163
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,915
(Frank) Oi, Frances, the car's outside.

164
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,665
(Sighs)

165
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,040
(Frank) Oh! (Chuckles)

166
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,790
You've got glamour, Frances.
You're like an East End starlet.

167
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,499
East End harlot's more like it.

168
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,332
(Frank) They're trousers, Mum.
She doesn't look like a harlot.

169
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,249
(Mrs Shea) What she's wearing
doesn't matter.

170
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,499
When people see her with Reggie Kray,
they'll think she's a tart.

171
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,082
Why would you say that?

172
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,624
He's a gangster, Frances.
The Krays are gangsters.

173
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,499
- Well, I think he's sweet.
- Oh, God!

174
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,749
And I'm going to kiss him.
Do you hear me?

175
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

176
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,790
You look lovely.

177
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,290
So do you.

178
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,665
Hello. This is Big Pat.

179
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,374
- Hello, Big Pat.
- Reggie.

180
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,832
- How you doing? You all right, mate?
- Miss. Nice to see you.

181
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,957
Big Pat's here to keep riff-raff out.

182
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,790
Always. (Chuckles)

183
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,540
So how come you're
letting us in, then, mate?

184
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,499
- (Laughing)
- Have a good night.

185
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,249
- Thank you.
- Thanks, mate. Cheers.

186
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,499
Oh, hello, here's trouble.
Hold the phone.

187
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:01,040
- Oi, you. How you doing, big man?
- You all right, boss?

188
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,624
- Are you well?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

189
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,999
- You behaving yourself?
- Always. I'm a teddy bear, me.

190
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,165
Go easy. If he gives you any trouble,
come and speak to me. Come on.

191
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,082
- You all right, ma'am?
- Yeah, I'm good. She's good.

192
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,457
- (Man 1) Hello, Reg.
- Hello.

193
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,832
(Man 2) Reg, you all right?
(Man 3) Mr Kray.

194
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,999
- Everyone here knows you.
- Yeah, well, I own it, it's my club.

195
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:20,790
- You mean it's your local?
- No, I own the place. It's mine.

196
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,040
I've been by here 10 times,
I never knew it was yours.

197
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:26,749
Well, you can get away with a lot in life
if you keep your mouth shut.

198
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,749
Ooh, that's Teddy.
Hang on a second.

199
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,082
How you doing? You all right?
Good to see you. You good?

200
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,749
How's the family? Excellent.

201
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,624
- What?
- Those men look frightening.

202
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,165
No, no, they're just East End boxers.
They're lovely.

203
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,540
I let 'em drink in here for free,
you know.

204
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,665
Reggie, that's Joan Collins.

205
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,040
Yeah, might be, yeah.

206
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,624
We had that Barbara Windsor in here
the other night.

207
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,590
- Really?
- She comes in quite a bit, actually.

208
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,040
She loves it.
And, uh, that's my formula.

209
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:56,249
What I like to do is I like to mix celebrities
with a few, just a few, East End villains.

210
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,749
The punters, they love it.
It's really good for business.

211
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,999
Would you like a seat?

212
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,290
Excuse me, Reg.
Have you, uh, got a moment?

213
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,332
No, I don't, actually.
I'm busy. All right?

214
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,665
- Nah, it's important, Reg.
- This is important as well, so...

215
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,124
- Reg.
- All right.

216
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,249
Frances, would you mind if I, um...

217
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,335
if I take care of some business
just for a moment?

218
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,999
- No, of course not.
- Excuse me. Be back in a minute.

219
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,874
You sit with her. What is it?

220
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,457
- It's back here.
- What?

221
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,499
- Hello, Reg.
- All right, mate?

222
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,582
(Man) In fact, if you don't know,
you don't fucking know.

223
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,290
- You know what I mean?
- (Donoghue) Reggie.

224
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,082
How are you, Reg?

225
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,624
I'm all right. I can't complain.
Who'd fucking listen?

226
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,624
- What's the palaver? Go on.
- Sit down, Reg. Sit down, please.

227
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,790
All right.

228
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,915
You had a question about our take
in the purple heart business. Pill game.

229
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,374
- Go on.
- Jack here would like to explain himself.

230
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,540
Go on.

231
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,582
Go on, Jack.
Tell Reggie what you told me.

232
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,665
Well, Reg...

233
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,499
- Yeah?
- I, uh...

234
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:00,832
The thing is, under normal
circumstances, my accounts...

235
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:05,790
Are you going to take all fucking night,
mate? 'Cause I've got things to do.

236
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,707
Tell him, Jack. Go on, spit it out.

237
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,707
- I borrowed a few quid off the top.
- Right. All right.

238
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,233
- I sold a few pills on the side.
- Yeah, there's a surprise.

239
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,165
Things have been a bit tight at home

240
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,082
and I was just trying
to keep the wife happy.

241
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,408
Trying to keep the wife happy.

242
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,624
Is this why you brought me in here,
for this? This nonsense?

243
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,290
- It's important business, Reg.
- It's important, is it? Yeah?

244
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,082
- You should know about this.
- All right, let's deal with this business.

245
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:32,165
Tomorrow, you come back to work,
and you pay back every fucking penny.

246
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,415
- I was going to suggest that.
- Good. Right. Are we done?

247
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,499
Everybody happy?

248
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,832
All right, then, can I get back
to my fucking evening?

249
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,832
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Albie. Cheers.

250
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,624
- Sorry for wasting your time, Jack.
- Thanks.

251
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,874
Thanks for coming in.

252
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,832
- Here you go, mate.
- (Lighter clicks)

253
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,624
Good?

254
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,624
You fucking little thieving cunt.
You understand?

255
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,915
I heard me. Yeah?

256
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,040
Next time I'll finish you off,
you little slag.

257
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,249
- Get him out of here. Fuck him off.
- (Jack) Fuck!

258
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,374
You fucking what?
What did you say?

259
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,165
Don't you swear in my club.
Get him out of here right now.

260
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:12,790
Don't swear in my club. Wanker.

261
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,582
- Listen, there's something else.
- No, there isn't something else,

262
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,040
'cause I've got a young lady in here
and I'm entertaining.

263
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,249
- Have a look at that. See that there?
- I see it.

264
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,915
I'm entertaining, all right?
So I'm gonna have an evening to myself.

265
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,624
- This is important business.
- Can't be. My business, innit?

266
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,999
It's my business. I would know.

267
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,832
Night, Albie.

268
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,582
Hello.
Did I miss anything important?

269
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:39,165
- No, just me.
- Now, that is important.

270
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,415
- Is it?
- Very important.

271
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,499
Thank you.

272
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:44,749
Thank you.

273
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,540
(Mouthing)

274
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:53,249
So, um... your brother, he was telling me
that you, uh... you're going to college

275
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:57,082
to... to study to be a secretary.
Is that right?

276
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,457
Yeah, anything
to get out of the East End.

277
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,082
What's so bad about the East End?

278
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:06,290
I've just got bigger dreams than pushing
a pram or haggling with the butcher.

279
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,707
Hmm.

280
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,499
I just don't quite know
what they are yet.

281
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,415
Well, the East End's not that bad.

282
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,332
The centre of the earth
can be anywhere you like.

283
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,124
- Even here?
- Yeah, even here.

284
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,540
- In Bethnal Green?
- Yeah, Bethnal Green.

285
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,874
(Inhales deeply)

286
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,207
Do you like being a gangster?

287
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,582
I'm not a gangster.

288
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,165
I'm a club owner.

289
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,999
(Chuckles)

290
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:44,332
I like the money and I like the respect
of being a club owner.

291
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,999
But I'm not a gangster.

292
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,249
I could have been a boxer,

293
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,749
but then, you know... hello, mate...

294
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,749
I'd end up looking like
some sort of potato.

295
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,957
And I wouldn't even know
what day of the week it was.

296
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,665
This way, at least I know
who I am, you know?

297
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:04,832
More so, I like the fact that
I've made a little something of myself.

298
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,082
I don't owe the world anything.

299
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,790
So long as the world agrees with you.

300
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,499
I think the world will be all right.

301
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,249
(Winston Churchill on speakers)
'We shall fight on the beaches.

302
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,874
'We shall fight on the landing grounds.

303
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,400
- 'We shall fight in the fields...'
- (Approaching footsteps)

304
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,915
'...and in the streets.

305
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,332
'We shall fight in the hills.

306
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,582
'We shall never surrender, and if...'

307
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,624
- Hey, Ronnie!
- (Recording stops)

308
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,749
Ronnie, come on out.
You've got visitors, mate.

309
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,999
Watch your step. It's a bit wet.

310
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,207
- You all right?
- Mmm-hmm.

311
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,582
- You must be Frances.
- Hello.

312
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,874
Huh?

313
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,874
Hello, Frances. Hello.
Welcome to the family.

314
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,665
Well, it's a bit premature,
that, is it?

315
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,124
(Chuckles)

316
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,665
- You don't have a beer that I could have?
- Yeah, of course I do. Help yourself.

317
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,624
Don't mind if I have a beer, do you?

318
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,874
I'll let you get to know each other.

319
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,332
Want a cup of tea?
I just put the kettle on.

320
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,624
Take a seat. Go on.

321
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,874
Sit down anywhere you like.

322
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,999
Needs a bit of warming up. So...

323
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,040
What do you think?

324
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,624
Do you think that we look alike,
me and Reggie?

325
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,082
Oh, yes, certainly.

326
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,540
No, you don't.
You think that he's beautiful

327
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:39,499
and I've got a face
like a gorilla's arse.

328
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,374
- (Laughs)
- It's all right, don't worry about it.

329
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,332
- No. I wouldn't say that.
- I'm used to it.

330
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,058
(Reggie) Stop doing your hair, right?
Get me stuff out of the car.

331
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,540
Do something fucking useful.

332
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,499
Yeah, go on, then.

333
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:01,540
I'm homosexual, Frances.

334
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:08,332
Well, I am a, uh... I'm a giver, right?
I'm not a receiver.

335
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,082
There is a difference. I'm not a faggot.

336
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,290
But I do believe that, you know,
you should not hide what you are.

337
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:19,582
You shouldn't hide what you are
'cause it'll make you very sad, you know?

338
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,457
It'll make you very sad.
It'll make you very unwell.

339
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,499
- I agree completely.
- Mmm.

340
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:29,624
You know, me and my brother,
we're going to rule London.

341
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,915
(Frances) 'The Krays' main rivals
were the Richardsons of South London.

342
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,790
'They were called the Torture Gang.'

343
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:42,165
For the benefit of the jury,

344
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:46,374
on whose behalf were you operating
on this side of the river?

345
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,249
Come on, Charlie, please.
I'm begging you.

346
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,332
No, no, no. You do business
with the court as an entity,

347
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,790
- therefore, address the court.
- What?

348
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,207
- What? "Your Honour"!
- (Grunts) Fuck!

349
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,582
You say "Your Honour".

350
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,332
By saying "Your Honour",
you gain the court's attention

351
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,540
and open up a channel
of communication, a conduit.

352
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,582
So, we'll try again.

353
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,999
For the benefit of the jury,

354
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,082
on whose behalf were you working
on this side of the river?

355
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,915
- Please, Charlie! I fucking beg of you!
- Order!

356
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,124
Order in this, my court!

357
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,249
(Grunting) Fuck!

358
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,874
You're in Indian country, old son.

359
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,124
That's what them cockneys
call south of the river, innit?

360
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,040
Indian country.

361
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,999
Well, what are you doing
on my reservation without my say-so,

362
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:39,290
filling up your canteen
from my fucking watering hole?

363
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,624
You ain't got the bottle to do that
on your own, son. Who do you work for?

364
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,790
I don't know what you're on about, Charlie.
I don't know what you're on about.

365
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:48,207
- Say their names. Say it!
- Fuck.

366
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,665
- Buzz him.
- Uh, objection, Your Honour.

367
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,665
My client is an upstanding citizen.

368
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:55,040
Objection overruled
on the grounds it's boring.

369
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,249
Oh, well, fuck him.

370
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,290
- (Crackling)
- (Screaming)

371
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:02,249
- Say it. Say "the Krays", you daft cunt.
- Fuck it!

372
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,790
No, no.
No leading the witness, Eddie.

373
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:25,332
- (Engine revving)
- (Tyres squealing)

374
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,790
Fuck off!

375
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,790
Alexander might have been great,
but he wasn't a Greek.

376
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,790
- No?
- No. He was a Macedonian.

377
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,874
But he loved them, though,
Aristotle and that lot.

378
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,582
He was deeply impressed
by them flash Hellenistic cunts.

379
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,207
Christos, get us some more
of that awful retsina.

380
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,582
(Woman screams)

381
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:05,624
Charlie, we've got to fucking sort this.

382
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,582
You're absolutely right.
Christos, where's my retsina?

383
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:13,415
(Frances) 'The Richardsons
sent George Cornell to call for a truce.

384
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,707
'All they were saying
was give peace a chance.'

385
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,915
- Fucking Frank'll win.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck!

386
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:22,874
- Are you wearing your bravery jacket?
- We're here to parley.

387
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,332
I will fucking map you up, Southie.

388
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,915
No, no, no. Go on, let him in.
He's only little.

389
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,790
Things have got out of hand.
Charlie wants to meet.

390
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,790
Pig and Whistle. Neutral ground.

391
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,374
Just him, you two and Eddie.

392
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,290
Yep. And how do we know
that we're going to be safe?

393
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:43,999
Well, that's a little thing
called trust, ain't it?

394
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:48,665
Trust, eh? You always got one bloke
harping on about trust, don't you?

395
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:50,582
But then you look
over your shoulder, right,

396
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:54,040
and you see there's another bloke there,
right, with his Hampton in his hand

397
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,749
and he's preparing to shove his cock
right up your arse.

398
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,457
Well, you wouldn't mind that.

399
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,957
You fat poof.

400
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:09,374
(Cocks gun)

401
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,374
Whoa, no. No, no, no...

402
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,582
Right, you, get him out of here.
Go on, fuck off.

403
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,749
- One hour. We'll be with you.
- That's it, bye-bye.

404
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,457
Fuck off, George.

405
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,415
There's the door, go on.

406
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,540
- Bye-bye.
- Take that dead fox with you. Go on.

407
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,624
Get out, you prick.

408
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:25,332
What a fucking liberty.

409
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,540
Big Charlie, please could I have
another egg?

410
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:30,915
I've eaten this one.

411
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,915
I don't like it, Reggie.

412
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,999
Nah, it's all right.

413
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,540
I know them. I know the pub.

414
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,165
We'll be all right.

415
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,665
You got to clean that fucking toilet, mate.
It stinks.

416
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,499
Mate, I paid a girl to do it.
It's not my fault if she don't.

417
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,145
- What are you having to drink?
- Um...

418
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,249
Forget it. They just walked in.

419
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,441
- Mate, can I get two Guinnesses, please?
- Hang on a second.

420
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,415
I just gotta go down
to change the barrel.

421
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,082
Reg. Ron.

422
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,207
The Richardsons were
unexpectedly engaged,

423
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,915
so we're going to look after you.

424
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:10,790
Oh, it's all right. The landlord's gone
to change the barrel for me. Thanks.

425
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,999
You don't mind
if I pull myself a pint, do you?

426
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,457
- What is that?
- What do you think, poof?

427
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:16,790
It's a fucking tool.

428
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:20,540
No, it's not. It's a fucking rolling pin.
Who are you, Fanny Cradock?

429
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,947
What are you gonna do with that?
You gonna bake me a cake?

430
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:25,540
You gonna sing me a song,
watch me blow out me fucking candles?

431
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,832
I come here
for a fucking shootout, right?

432
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:33,540
A proper shootout
with some proper men,

433
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:37,124
like Colonel Custer and Geronimo.
Have you ever heard of 'em? No.

434
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,832
'Cause you were too busy in your pinny
baking fucking fairy cakes, weren't you?

435
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,749
Reg, this lot are fucking nonces, to a man.
They're fucking nonces.

436
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,457
Get out of me fucking way.
Go on, get out. Go on, fuck off.

437
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:51,082
Call yourself a fucking gangster?

438
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:54,249
A shootout, right,
is a fucking shootout!

439
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,790
Like a Western.

440
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:05,457
Wankers! Fucking embarrassing.

441
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:08,874
Waste of my time.
Fucking waste of my time.

442
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,749
Well, your brother's done a runner.

443
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:17,207
Ah, he's just genuinely disappointed
with you. That's all.

444
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:21,040
Look at that. Full of iron, that is.

445
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:24,790
See, it takes a while, that does,
you know, to settle.

446
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:27,957
Charlie Richardson said we're to knock
the granny out of you, Reg.

447
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:32,290
Oh, yeah? He did, did he?
That's good of him. All right, listen.

448
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,915
When you see him next,
you tell him from me, yeah,

449
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:38,624
that I say... fuck Charlie, right?

450
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,582
And fuck his brother, yeah?

451
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:43,249
And fuck that fat Georgie Cornell
that hangs out with him.

452
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,665
Fuck your face. Yeah, yeah?

453
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:50,332
And fuck the fucking lot of you as well.
What do you think of that? Eh?

454
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,874
- You like that?
- Mmm.

455
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,957
- You won't mind if I fight back, will you?
- You think you can manage it?

456
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:59,207
Ah, it's more for me pride, really,
to be honest.

457
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,124
I warn you,
I'm not gonna fight fair, though.

458
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,790
So I brought these.

459
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:04,374
All right?

460
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,874
Now, before we start,
I got a little joke for you.

461
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,749
You'll love this one.

I'm not often intrigued,

- It intrigued.
- Hmm.

What's this about, Mr Payne?

499

This is about a gambling casino in
Knightsbridge called Esmeralda's Barn.

- I'm not familiar with it.
- Really?

Meyer Lansky.

Are the Americans gonna try
and muscle in on us?

525
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:48,874
No. They don't work that way.
They don't want a war, Ron.

526
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,957
- They're businessmen.
- Well, maybe I want a war with them.

527
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,207
(Leslie) Now, look.

528
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:57,332
What they do want is to know
who is the up-and-coming local firm,

529
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:00,332
because they will colonise London
by financing that firm,

530
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:01,957
then franchising the city.

531
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:05,499
So you have to prove to the Americans
that the Krays are the only game in town.

532
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:08,499
Yeah, very fucking interesting.

You say "our" a lot, right?

536
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:21,832
You say "our"
and you also say "we" a lot.

538
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:27,540

Listen, Ron, you keep the pearls.
I'm perfectly happy with the soft bits.

541
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,290
Yeah, I bet you are.

I bet you are.

543
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:44,082
Reggie, I say it's a very bad idea.
It's just a bad idea.

544
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:48,082
I say, right, that we meet these
Mafioso scum at London Airport, right?

545
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:50,082
We pick them up, we chop them up,

546
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:54,082
put them in their fucking luggage
and send them straight home, mate.

547
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,082
That's the plan.

548
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:08,374
Well, I'm glad
we could have this meeting.

549
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,790
Mr Lansky has taken an interest
in the Colony Sporting Club.

550
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:13,915
He has his casino people there
right now.

551
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:17,624
Well, Mr Lansky might want to know

552
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,832
that we happen to have
a casino of our own.

553
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:24,290
Really? Your own casino?

554
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,832
Well, you see, we own Las Vegas.

555
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:27,874
(Smirks)

556
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:31,332
But here,
the Atlantic Ocean is in our way.

557
00:31:31,458 --> 00:31:33,415
So Mr Lansky lacks the ability

558
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:36,790
to, uh... ensure the physical security
of his property,

559
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:40,582
from both outside muscle and the cops.

560
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:42,290
He thinks the Kray family could help.

561
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:45,749
London is going to be
the Las Vegas of Europe.

562
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:49,624
We need someone to front
and someone to muscle for us.

563
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:53,749
Uh... I mean, look,
we can do your security, right,

564
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:57,540
that's not a problem, you know,
but we don't want to work for you.

565
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,540
I mean, we'd much rather
that we work with you.

566
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,040
What Reggie is trying to say...

567
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:05,582
I think he knows what he's trying to say.
He just said it.

568
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,707
- We're in your backyard.
- Yeah.

569
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:10,374
And Mr Lansky is open
to discussions of this nature.

570
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,499
He sends this as a goodwill gesture.

571
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:16,290
Just a taste. For expenses.
Open it, please.

572
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:26,874
Now, the second briefcase contains
business of my own I need to take care of.

573
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,540
Please.

574
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:34,457
Bearer bonds. Free money.

575
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:36,874
A hundred grand
in negotiable bearer bonds.

576
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,665
Jacked from a bank in Montreal.

577
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,540
Too hot to move in North America.

578
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:44,290
That's a hundred grand.

579
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,915
Could you guys handle that?

580
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,790
Yeah, we can handle it.

581
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:53,915
Really? Good.

582
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,124
Boys who jacked it get 20%.

583
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,207
We split the rest 60-40.

584
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:00,874
If this works out, Reggie,

585
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,624
I got a $2 million backlog
of those scharoles.

586
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:08,040
Does that sound
like you're staying out of our way?

587
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:13,832
50-50, mate.

588
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:21,124
I like you, Reggie.

589
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,082
50-50 it is. Done.

590
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,499
I'm glad we could make a deal.

591
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,790
- Yeah.
- Now, this feels right.

592
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:30,790
Listen, you come to Philadelphia
any time,

593
00:33:30,916 --> 00:33:34,332
you see what you want, any size,
any shape, right? We'll get it for you.

594
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:37,249
A nice Italian girl.
Little spaghetti and meatballs.

595
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,499
I prefer boys.

596
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,040
Excuse me? I didn't catch that.

597
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,165
I said I prefer boys.

598
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,540
Italians, actually.

599
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:52,624
Sometimes Greek,
but I am not prejudiced.

600
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,874
No. Because I happen
to have had a Negro once

601
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,499
and a Tahitian,
who I bent up like a pretzel.

602
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:02,082
I really fucking hurt him.

603
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:10,124
(Laughs) You got a lot of fucking balls
to admit that, kid.

604
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:13,499
You know what? You got
some fucking set of castagnas on you.

605
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:16,624
You know what I say to that? Bravo!
Salute! Come on. Salute!

606
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,624
- Salute.
- Am I right, fellas?

607
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,082
- (Reggie) Cheers, mate.
- What fucking balls! Salute!

608
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:23,499
- Cheers, mate.
- Cheers.

609
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:24,707
- Cheers.
- Salute.

610
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:25,999
Marrone.

611
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,082
Cheers, mate.

713
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,415
No, no, no. Please, please.
Just for a moment, just listen.

714
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:27,624
Gambling clubs are legally obliged
to pay winnings on the spot.

715
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,624
And that is why we insist our gamblers
pay their debts on the spot as well.

725
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,874
I told you, Enugu! Right?

726
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,790
You don't know everything,
do you, Payne?

727
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:06,124
Did you know that "Enugu"
is the African word for "utopia"?

- No.
- No, you did not.

For £50,000,
I can make that somewhere.

731
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:17,249
I can turn it into a place
where people will smile at me

732

- I will smile for you, Ron.

733
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:25,665
I will smile for you if you tell me
where I can get £50,000.

734
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:28,671
I'm telling you. I'm fucking telling you.
Just pull it out of the casino.

735
00:42:28,708 --> 00:42:32,415

Do not meddle with a foolproof way
of making the money!

737
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,999
I'm not a fucking banker!

738

I am not a fucking banker!

739
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:42,499

- Genius! Look at that.

740
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:44,290
That has made it
all the more manageable.

741

745
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:01,582

and you will fetch me my £50,000.

747
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,457
Yeah, I'll go down to the bank
and see what I can do.

748
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:09,707
And I'll tell you what,
I may work for you, Ron,

749
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:13,915
but I'm certainly not afraid of you,
all right?

750
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:17,540
Well, that is fucking stupid as well,
because you fucking should be.

751

vouched for you, you'd be fucking dead.

00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:55,957
What are you doing here?
Didn't Ronnie tell you not to come?

756
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:01,082

- Look.

757

Frankie, I don't want you to come here
and see me like this, understand?

758
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,832
- Who did it?
- What?

759
00:44:06,958 --> 00:44:09,749
Your face.
Was it one of the other prisoners?

760
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:13,540
No, no.
It was one of the guards, all right?

761
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:15,790
- Well, have you reported them?
- No.

762
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:17,624
But you know what?
When I get out, I'm thinking

763
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,750
I might go to the Houses of Parliament,
have a word with the Prime Minister,

00:44:20,833 --> 00:44:22,374
'cause he will listen, he will.

765
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,624
Frankie, this is prison, OK?

766
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:28,207
That's what this is.
It's the law of the jungle in here.

767
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,213
But don't worry about it,
because I'm a big boy,

768
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:33,707
I can look after meself
and I'll be out very soon. All right?

769
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:36,290
Go on, have a look at that lump
over there, you see him?

770
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:37,582
With the big hat.

771
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:41,207
There's a very good reason
why we all call him Handbag.

772
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:44,999
All right?

773
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,915
I don't want a life like this.

774
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:54,624
- Just waiting, while you're in prison.
- I know. I know.

775
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,582
(Exhales deeply)

776
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:02,624
- Frankie, it won't happen again.
- How can you be sure?

777
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,915
Because I know. Because I promise you
it won't happen again.

778
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:07,832
All right?

779
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,624
I know how you can be sure.

780
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,499
- Go on.
- You could go straight.

781
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:18,374
Be a casino owner, a club owner.
You enjoy it.

782
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,165
Just forget everything else.

783
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:25,082
It really is that simple for you, innit?
Yeah, just go straight.

784
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:31,290
Babe, life isn't always the way
we want it to be, you know.

785
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:33,249
Life has other plans. It...

786
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,999
- It's the way it is. It's life.
- I love you.

787
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,832
I love you.

788
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:47,290
I never loved anybody before,
but I love you, Reggie.

789
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:51,915
And I love you, too.

790
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:55,207
(Sighs)

791
00:45:58,041 --> 00:45:59,582
You think it can protect people?

792
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:01,999
What?

793
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,082
Love.

794
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:10,165
(Ron) I like him. Yeah, he got
something about him, ain't he?

795
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:13,540
(Mad Teddy) Do you know
what I reckon it is? I think it's his hips.

796
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:16,832
I want to blow the soul
out of that horn.

797
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,290
You feeling a bit horny, are you, Ron?

798
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:24,374
- I am. I am.
- (Chuckling)

799
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,207
- Go on. Do it.
- I will. Yeah.

800
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:28,582
I want to blow the soul
out of that horn.

801
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:32,124
That's what I'm gonna do.
OK? OK?

802
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,124
Tiger!

803
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,915
(Blows horn off-key)

804
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:46,707
That's it, Ron, give it a fucking blow.

805
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:54,415
(Giggling)

806
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:58,124
(Ron) Kill it.

807
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,249
- (♪ Music stops)
- (Indistinct murmuring)

808
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,624
Oh, fucking hell.

809
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,290
Right.

810
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:12,749
Hello. Hello?

811
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:14,124
Yes, Ron. Hello.

812
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,415
Do you know when I plan to die?

813
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,957
- When, Ron?
- At the very last minute.

814
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:22,749
(Laughing)

815
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:26,082
Don't fucking encourage him,
for fuck's sake.

816
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:31,082
Look at you, you flash fuckers. Eh?

817
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:36,290
Now, I may not be very good, granted.

818
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:38,374
But good gangster?

819
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:42,374
Oh, yeah.
I'll fucking claim that title.

820
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:46,332
And how many titles
could you claim? Eh?

821
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:49,582
Superficialite. Hmm?

822
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:54,040
Oh, yeah.
Dripping in your synthetic opulence.

823
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:55,790
Ha!

824
00:47:56,666 --> 00:48:00,540
It's disgusting. Really is.
Yeah.

825
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:02,915
Right, a bit of magic.
You love magic, don't you?

826
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:04,749
All kids love magic.

827
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:09,957
You might all be aware
that there are three magic Cs, right,

828
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:11,957
in the word "carpaccio". Yeah?

829
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:15,332
But how many Cs...

830
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,707
...are in the word "cunt"?

831
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:24,749
Just you.

832
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:28,999
(Laughing)

833
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,832
(Microphone clatters)

834
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,582
(Clinking on window)

835
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:50,874
You're free.

836
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:54,165
What are you doing
throwing stones at the window?

837
00:48:54,291 --> 00:48:55,790
They're not, they're not stones.

838
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:58,207
These are... these are lemon sherbets.
Here you go.

839
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:02,124
Oh, well played.

840
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,665
Why don't you ring the bell?

841
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:06,124
Well, your mum.

842
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,082
I mean, I'm not being funny,

843
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:11,082
but the thought of your mum answering
that door is a bit shocking, so...

844
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:13,082
I thought she'd give me grief
on account of where I've been.

845
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:17,249
- You mean prison?
- Yeah, prison. You look beautiful.

846
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:19,499
You look beautiful, too.

847
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,124
I know it's a bit late, right, but...

848
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,749
I've got your Christmas present here.

849
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,665
- Do you want me to throw it up?
- No.

850
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:30,749
What? You want me to deliver it?
I ain't going through that door.

851
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:31,999
All right.

852
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:36,374
You cheeky bugger.

853
00:49:41,166 --> 00:49:42,207
Be careful.

854
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:45,499
(Grunts) A bit late now, innit?

855
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:47,332
Right!

856
00:49:48,916 --> 00:49:51,249
- Your flowers.
- Thank you.

857
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:53,707
And...

858
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:57,624
...your Christmas present.

859
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,499
Sorry it's late.

860
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:03,874
Go on, open it.

861
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:09,624
Frances Shea, will you marry me?

862
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:15,874
We'll live free and above-board?

863
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:19,290
On my honour.

864
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:25,290
Yes, Reggie Kray, I will marry you.

865
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:32,665
- (Reggie) Mmm.
- (Crunching)

866
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:34,040
That one of mine?

867
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:36,832
Cheeky.

868
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:39,374
(♪ Striptease music playing)

869
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:43,124
That's it.

870
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:47,499
Come on,
show us your fucking hoochie.

871
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:50,624
- Give us a fucking look.
- You're not listening. You're not listening.

872
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,957
All I'm saying, all I'm saying is
crime is still a business.

873
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:58,374
You need a public relations department,
and we've got Joseph Goebbels.

874
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,082
- (Chuckling)
- Is he the fat one?

875
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:03,749
You read lips. What's he saying?
What's he saying, Les?

876
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:08,957
I'm struggling, but I think he's saying
something about gobbles or no balls?

877
00:51:10,375 --> 00:51:11,665
That's very strange.

878
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:15,165
He ain't happy. You'll see.

879
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:22,499
Nice, innit?

880
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:26,874
Oh, he looks lovely, Ron.

881
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,082
He's put on
a little bit of timber, ain't he?

882
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:32,249
He's going to be very, very upset.

883
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:35,040
Did I miss something?

884
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:38,707
Is this not...
This is Friday night, right?

885
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,165
Well, I tried to tell you.

886
00:51:40,291 --> 00:51:41,790
Yeah, but it's Friday night, right?

887
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:43,836
You didn't tell me
that it was this bad, did you?

888
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:46,874
It's Ron, innit?
He's run the place into the ground.

889
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,790
He's turned a straight money earner
into a financial wreck.

890
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:53,790
And another thing: This place will crash
when we get our tax bill next week.

891
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:56,457
What's he saying? What's he saying?

892
00:51:56,583 --> 00:52:00,582
He's just told him that you're missing
tax payments. Silly cunt!

893
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,415
Let's go.

894
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,415
This is tomorrow's business.
Do you understand?

895
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:11,749
That's very rude.

896
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:17,207
- Oi, where are you going?
- It's fucking criminal, mate!

897
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:18,790
Criminal!

898
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,707
Hey, where are you going?

899
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:29,832
Oh, there he is,
my beautiful brother, Reggie.

900
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:32,374
A toast to my beautiful brother.

901
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,749
Home at last,
like Agamemnon returned to Ithaca.

902
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:38,832
And beautiful Frances.

903
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:40,290
Where have you been?

904
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:43,082
It's as if you've returned
from the dead.

905
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:46,540
What are you doing, mate?
What are you fucking playing at? Eh?

906
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:48,249
I'm not playing at anything.
It's you.

907
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:50,499
You come in here.
You don't even say, "Hello, Ron."

908
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,165
You don't even have a drink.
You just bugger off.

909
00:52:53,291 --> 00:52:56,915
- Hello, Ron. Cheers, mate. Fuck you!
- What are you shouting at me for?

910
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:58,915
Because you had the world
on a string, yeah?

911
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:01,165
But you couldn't hold it together
so you fucked it up.

912
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:04,040
- Don't... Listen, you was away.
- I was in prison.

913
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:05,957
I had to make do with what I had.

914
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:08,082
You going Ron or Reg?

915
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:11,957
- Score?
- Mmm-hmm.

916
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:14,957
Reginald. He'll never go down
in front of the missus.

917
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:18,624
- You had everything, mate. You had it all.
- I didn't have you, did I?

918
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,957
- Reggie, please.
- It's all right, honestly. I got this. It's fine.

919
00:53:21,083 --> 00:53:23,915
Yeah, actually, he's got this.
Thank you very much. He's a big boy.

920
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:25,624
We're talking about earning a living.

921
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:28,374
We're talking about being gangsters,
right, which is what we are.

922
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,874
- So you can just fuck off. Go on.
- Don't.

923
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,415
You know, one of these days, Ron Kray,
your miserable life will swallow you whole.

924
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:39,915
You should know all about that, because
I've heard all the stories. They're not good.

925
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:42,665
Your mum did palm us off
with the damaged goods, didn't she?

926
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:44,499
You're very, very damaged, aren't you?

927
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:45,915
All right, just get in the car.

928
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:48,707
- Don't ever speak to her like that again.
- Yeah, that's right, Frances.

929
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:52,165
Blood is thicker than water,
and I've been with Reggie since the womb.

930
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:55,374
Ron, shut up. I want you to apologise
to Frances right now.

931
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,165
- Right.
- All right.

932
00:53:57,291 --> 00:54:00,374
Right, right. Frances.

933
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,374
I'm sorry, all right? Yes.

934
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:06,624
I'm truly very sorry
the club's very, very empty.

935
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:11,374
A bit like you, really. There's fuck-all in it,
apart from my brother's cock.

936
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,499
(Woman exclaims)

937
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:18,499
(Ron groaning)

938
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:32,874
You, all right,
are a fucking disgrace, mate.

939
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,499
You hit me.

940
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:40,499
Yeah.

941
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:44,582
(Groans)

942
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:47,582
- No! No!
- No, Ron.

943
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:48,915
No! No!

944
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:55,249
I fucking did, you fucking cunt!

945
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:58,457
(Glasses clinking)

946
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:00,582
(Ron) Fucking cunt!

947
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:03,124
(Woman screams)

948
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,707
- Fuck's sake!
- Not the bottle. Not the...

949
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:12,249
No! Not the balls!

950
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,374
(Reggie screams)

951
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,207
My fucking nuts! Wanker!

952
00:55:18,708 --> 00:55:20,332
(Screaming)

953
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,374
Sweetheart, please leave.

954
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:25,249
Biting! Biting cunt!

955
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:27,582
- (Bones crunching)
- (Ron screams)

956
00:55:29,458 --> 00:55:31,207
(Screams)

957
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,040
Ah!

958
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,374
Give me that.

959
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,332
(Panting)

960
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:44,415
Never mess with a man's jewels, mate.
What the fuck...

961
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:52,165
Now what are you doing?
No, Ron. No. No, no. That's a bottle, Ron.

962
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:55,624
- That's a bottle!
- I'll serve you up, you fucking cunt!

963
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,582
It's a bottle, Ron!

964
00:55:57,708 --> 00:56:00,165
(Big Pat) That's enough.

965
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:02,249
- Pack it in. That's enough!
- (Ron screaming)

966
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:04,207
- I'm going to split them up.
- Shut up, mate.

967
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:05,773
Get back and sit down in your chair.

968
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:07,999
No. They're family.

969
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:09,874
Stay back.
Get out of the fucking way.

970
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,957
(Ron screaming)

971
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:13,582
(Big Pat) Put it down!

972
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:19,124
(Big Pat) OK, now, I told you!

973
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,749
- Come on, that's enough.
- (Panting)

974
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:23,915
(Groaning)

975
00:56:24,666 --> 00:56:26,457
(Ron) No.

976
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,290
No.

977
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,874
- Enough, Reg, mate.
- (Ron groans)

978
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,374
(Ron) You just don't understand,
you don't...

979
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,082
Fuck.

980
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:39,582
You don't understand me.

981
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:43,082
That's probably 'cause I don't want to
fucking understand you right now, Ron.

982
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:44,582
I wanted to just, you know...

983
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:49,207
There's no point in
fucking explaining it to you, either.

984
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:53,290
It's fucking hopeless.
Come on, help me up.

985
00:56:53,416 --> 00:56:55,332
Just help me out here, will you?

986
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:58,040
- That fucking hurt.
- All right, mate. What are you doing?

987
00:56:58,166 --> 00:56:59,540
For fuck's sake, Ron.

988
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:04,249
Reggie, what I'm trying to tell you
is very simple, all right?

989
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:05,790
Listen.

990
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:12,124
I am very, very, very fragile,
myself.

991
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:13,374
All right?

992
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,374
Yeah, fragile, I've got it.

993
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,082
- Very fragile.
- I've got it.

994
00:57:18,208 --> 00:57:19,499
(Sniffling)

995
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:28,582
All right, come on, now.
For fuck's sake.

996
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:31,332
I'm not myself, am I?

997
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:33,665
I mean, this isn't me. Is it?

998
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:36,582
This isn't us.
None of this is us, is it?

999
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:41,207
- I'm very sorry.
- It's OK.

1000
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:42,999
Are you done?

1001
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:45,499
Has she gone?

1002
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:48,582
- Yes, she's gone, mate.
- She's a keeper.

1003
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:50,790
She is. Thank you, Ron.
Thanks.

1004
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,665
(Honking)

1005
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:05,415
- There she is.
- Yeah, I got her.

1006
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:07,415
(Reggie) All right, stop here.

1007
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:10,582
That girl's gonna be the death of me.

1008
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:12,040
Mind how you go.

1009
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:15,332
(Reggie) Frankie. Frank.
Excuse me. Sorry.

1010
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,957
I need to have a word with you
about something.

1011
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:19,540
I don't care if you forget me.

1012
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:21,415
- Don't say that.
- It's true.

1013
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:22,582
You don't mean it.

1014
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,508
Don't tell me what I mean.
I know what I mean.

1015
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:26,832
Come on, Frances, please.
Can't we just start again?

1016
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:28,415
From the beginning, you know.

1017
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:32,165
We can get rid of everything that's bad,
and we'll just keep everything that's good.

1018
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:36,040
- What about Ron?
- What about Ron?

1019
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:38,082
He's not exactly a good bit, is he?

1020
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:41,124
Well... I mean,
he's not exactly a bad bit, either.

1021
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,790
- He was awful to me.
- Yeah, he was. But, you know, that...

1022
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:49,207
That's Ron. If he don't take his tablets,
he's like that. He's a nightmare.

1023
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,707
He's not always like that, you know.
He's got a heart of gold.

1024
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,540
He loves you to bits.
He thinks the world of you.

1025
00:58:54,666 --> 00:58:56,306
Honestly, when you left,
he was in pieces.

1026
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:58,790
He was like, "Where's she gone?"
I said, "She's left."

1027
00:58:58,916 --> 00:59:01,165
"Well, you better get after her
'cause she's a keeper."

1028
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:03,290
- (Chuckles)
- You are a keeper. So he's right.

1029
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:05,207
He said, "Tell her I'm very sorry."

1030
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:09,165
He is sorry and I'm sorry.
We're all sorry. But you know, that...

1031
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:11,874
That's what happens sometimes.
Families are stupid, aren't they?

1032
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,290
You know, they fight,
you know, they make up.

1033
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:17,957
And ultimately, you know, they stick
together 'cause they love each other.

1034
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:19,790
It's what they do.

1035
00:59:21,416 --> 00:59:24,582
Don't tell me about forgetting you,
'cause that ain't happening, either.

1036
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:26,874
I spent the last six months
thinking about nothing but you.

1037
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,999
- So I get out and the club's gone up...
- All right. All right.

1038
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:33,040
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1039
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:37,707
(Frances) 'It was time for the Krays
to enter the secret history of the 1960s.

I regret that my answer is no.

1049

Nigeria is simply too far away

Enugu, Nigeria.

1060
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,874
You are very well-informed, Teddy.

1061
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,624
Very well-informed.

1062

1381
01:19:41,625 --> 01:19:42,874
What's wrong with that?

1382
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,499
I just think you could do better, Ron.
You know.

1383
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:49,540
It'll keep you out of prison, I mean,
none of us are getting any younger.

1384
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:52,040
You know, you need to leave
all this behind, I mean...

1385
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:55,082
You got to look to the future,
you and that lovely young wife of yours.

1386
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:57,040
(Ron) No! Fairy tales!

1387
01:19:57,166 --> 01:19:58,749
That's fucking warning!

1388
01:19:58,875 --> 01:20:02,499
This is a firm, right?
I'm a fucking face.

1389
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:05,374
I'll fucking serve you up,
you fucking cunt!

1390
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,207
- (Glass shatters)
- You're fucking bang out of order!

1391
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:11,415
I don't fucking like him, I don't trust him.
He asks too many questions.

1392
01:20:11,541 --> 01:20:14,582
- I want him fucking dead!
- Leslie Payne, right, is our business,

1393
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:16,082
and you want him dead.

1394
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:19,290
- Have you been taking your tablets?
- Fuck tablets, right? Bugger tablets!

1395
01:20:19,416 --> 01:20:22,082
Bugger Payne,
the fucking pain in the arse!

1396
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:23,415
And fuck his briefcase!

1397
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:27,082
I don't give a fuck what's in there,
I want to know what's going on up there.

1398
01:20:31,541 --> 01:20:35,374
He knows too much about things.
Things about us.

1399
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,624
Reggie, he knows
too many things about us.

1400
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,707
He knows too many things about us?
Right.

1401
01:20:39,833 --> 01:20:42,082
Albie,
do you know things about us, mate?

1402
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:43,790
Do you know things? Eh?

1403
01:20:43,916 --> 01:20:46,415
About Ron, about me,
about the firm, right?

1404
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:48,415
You know about payments, right?

1405
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:50,124
You know we cash bearer bonds, yeah?

1406
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:53,665
D'you know we pay off juries to make 'em
look fucking favourably upon us, do you?

1407
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:54,999
Yes.

1408
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:56,874
You do. There's a fucking surprise.
Jack!

1409
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,707
Mate, do you know anything
about fraud?

1410
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:00,374
Anything at all? Take a punt.

1411
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,582
Do you know anything about
how we pay off policemen

1412
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:05,332
every fucking
final Thursday of the month?

1413
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:07,499
- Do you know that?
- Of course I do.

1414
01:21:07,625 --> 01:21:10,207
(Reggie) Fucking surprise, that.
So why don't we kill Jack now?

1415
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:12,540
Or we do Albie as well?
We do the fucking lot.

1416
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:16,207
Or you can do me and I'll do you
and we're both fucking dead!

1417
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:17,707
That's a genius idea!

1418
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:20,665
Listen to yourself, Ron!
You're fucking nuts!

1419
01:21:21,416 --> 01:21:22,915
Mmm.

1420
01:21:25,541 --> 01:21:30,290
People who live in glass houses
shouldn't throw stones.

1421
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:35,582
You know
I never drank gin till I came here?

1422
01:21:35,708 --> 01:21:38,249
Oh, well, next you'll be singing
God Save the Queen, won't you?

1423
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:40,374
(Chuckles)

1424
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,999
What did you want to have
a word with me about, Mr Bruno?

1425
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:45,957
Things are going well,
we're very happy on my side of the pond.

1426
01:21:46,083 --> 01:21:48,790
Well, that's good.
You know, we're very happy also.

1427
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:51,249
- OK.
- (Glasses clink)

1428
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:52,832
Cheers.

1429
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,749
Cheers.

1430
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:58,457
You realise I asked
to speak to you alone. Um...

1431
01:21:59,291 --> 01:22:03,040
You see, in our line of work,

1432
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:04,915
it's not good to be famous.

1433
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:08,332
Anonymous is the goal.

1434
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:11,832
This Mr Lansky, Reg,

1435
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:14,290
he sees a lot of potential in you.

1436
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:17,290
But he sees limitations
in your brother Ron.

1437
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:18,957
Well, you know, maybe...

1438
01:22:19,083 --> 01:22:21,999
Maybe they could just sit down
and meet each other, couldn't they?

1439
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:23,832
I mean,
he could come across for a chat.

1440
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:25,707
A chat? (Chuckles)

1441
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,499
You guys crack me up, really.

1442
01:22:29,958 --> 01:22:31,415
You ever hear of the Gallo brothers?

1443
01:22:31,541 --> 01:22:32,999
- From Brooklyn?
- No.

1444
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:35,707
Similar loose cannon situation.

1445
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,874
You see, Ron is your Joey.

1446
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:40,999
And it's not gonna end well
in either case.

1447
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:44,124
(Sighs)

1448
01:22:45,708 --> 01:22:48,415
What exactly are you
asking me to do, Mr Bruno?

1449
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:51,832
I'm asking you
to do something about Ron.

1450
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:56,624
I can't do that.

1451
01:22:58,041 --> 01:22:59,915
He's my brother.

1452
01:23:01,916 --> 01:23:03,290
OK.

1453
01:23:22,291 --> 01:23:23,915
(Door opens)

1454
01:23:27,041 --> 01:23:28,999
(Keys jangling)

1455
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:50,207
- There's nothing I can do.
- I ain't finished with you yet.

1456
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:54,374
- Mr Kray takes care of this warehouse.
- Now, you say Kray one more time...

1457
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:57,915
...and I'm gonna hit you, you understand?

1458
01:23:58,041 --> 01:23:59,441
I have an arrangement with Mr Kray.

1459
01:23:59,541 --> 01:24:01,582
I didn't ask whether we had
an arrangement.

1460
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:04,582
I asked if you understood me.

1461
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:06,707
(Frances)
'The Richardson gang were away.

1462
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:11,790
'But George Cornell had crossed the river
to work a protection racket on their behalf.'

1463
01:24:11,916 --> 01:24:14,415
I fucking warned you!

1464
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:17,999
(Frances) 'Ron's response would secure
his place in gangster legend.'

1465
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:19,915
What is that,
is that English breakfast tea?

1466
01:24:20,041 --> 01:24:22,082
I can tell by your face, Ted,
what you think of it.

1467
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:25,957
- Lovely box, isn't it? It's beautiful.
- It's not English breakfast. That's not, no.

1468
01:24:26,083 --> 01:24:28,790
That's got pheromones in it, that's got.

1469
01:24:29,791 --> 01:24:31,374
It's musky.

1470
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,957
That's a bit of magic, that is.

1471
01:24:34,791 --> 01:24:36,665
That's very beautiful, innit?

1472
01:24:36,791 --> 01:24:39,707
- I'm glad you like it.
- I do, that's proper.

1473
01:24:39,833 --> 01:24:42,540
Me mum will be very,
very pleased with that.

1474
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:44,832
Did you have that away
from the old warehouse, did you?

1475
01:24:44,958 --> 01:24:47,332
- Yeah.
- Don't say anything. It's all right.

1476
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:49,790
- Regards to Mrs Kray.
- Thank you.

1477
01:24:49,916 --> 01:24:53,165
- For the other matter.
- Yeah. What matter?

1478
01:25:02,541 --> 01:25:03,832
That?

1479
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:05,999
- Yeah.
- All right.

1480
01:25:07,291 --> 01:25:10,374
I mean, I'm not in the mind
to hand out refunds, am I?

1481
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:11,624
(All chuckling)

1482
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:15,999
Can't you handle it yourself?

1483
01:25:17,208 --> 01:25:19,374
I pay you for protection, Ron.

1484
01:25:23,541 --> 01:25:25,832
- What are you trying to say?
- Nothing...

1485
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:28,582
No, you just said it.
You just fucking said it.

1486
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:31,540
You come in here
with your fucking nose, right,

1487
01:25:32,541 --> 01:25:33,874
and your tea.

1488
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,957
Your fucking exotic tea.

1489
01:25:36,083 --> 01:25:37,165
Right?

1490
01:25:37,291 --> 01:25:39,165
And you say that.

1491
01:25:39,291 --> 01:25:41,540
I'm not very good at my job.

1492
01:25:41,666 --> 01:25:44,207
- I didn't mean it like that.
- You fucking did!

1493
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:47,082
- No, I... (Stutters)
- Ah!

1494
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:48,540
I'll tell you what.

1495
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:51,665
This matter of yours...

1496
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:55,249
- I'll deal with it for you. All right?
- All right.

1497
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:57,332
You go with Teddy, right,

1498
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,790
and you bring me £2,000, OK?

1499
01:26:01,541 --> 01:26:06,624
And in return, I promise
that I will have George Cornell killed.

1500
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:09,249
All right?

1501
01:26:09,375 --> 01:26:11,249
- I didn't say...
- All right?

1502
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:13,749
I didn't say
anything about killing, Ron.

1503
01:26:13,875 --> 01:26:16,165
You fucking did.

1504
01:26:16,291 --> 01:26:18,915
You fucking meant it.
Look at you, you meant it with your eyes.

1505
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:22,582
Look at your eyes. Eh?
It's in your fucking eyes!

1506
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:24,665
- Or are you threatening me?
- No.

1507
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:27,332
'Cause there's death in your eyes
and you're fucking threatening me!

1508
01:26:27,458 --> 01:26:29,207
- Is he threatening me?
- It's hard to tell, Ron.

1509
01:26:29,333 --> 01:26:30,415
- I'll pay.
- You'll what?

1510
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:31,624
- I'll pay.
- You will?

1511
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:34,374
- Yeah.
- There it is. And a deal is a deal.

1512
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:35,790
- It's done.
- Yeah.

1513
01:26:35,916 --> 01:26:38,540
It's done. It's over.
Teddy, take him.

1514
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:41,040
Thank you.

1515
01:26:41,166 --> 01:26:43,540
- That's very kind of you.
- Thank you.

1516
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:45,415
For the tea.

1517
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:49,957
That's a good deal.

1518
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:12,582
How do I look?

1519
01:27:13,291 --> 01:27:14,957
Fucking deadly.

1520
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:19,249
- Do you want me to come in with you?
- Hmm?

1521
01:27:19,375 --> 01:27:20,540
In there?

1522
01:27:23,041 --> 01:27:24,499
Come on.

1523
01:27:25,375 --> 01:27:27,040
You all stay in the car.

1524
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:31,249
- (Door closes)
- Anything you need to tell me?

1525
01:27:38,708 --> 01:27:40,499
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

1526
01:27:41,458 --> 01:27:43,374
- (Woman screams)
- Jesus!

1527
01:27:46,875 --> 01:27:48,915
Yeah, you're not laughing now, are you?

1528
01:27:50,041 --> 01:27:51,999
(Ian) For fuck's sake.

1529
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:55,040
Boss, the fuck...

1530
01:27:57,208 --> 01:27:58,457
(Barmaid screaming)

1531
01:27:58,583 --> 01:28:00,415
Get the fuck down!

1532
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:02,290
Don't say a fucking word!

1533
01:28:02,416 --> 01:28:04,249
What are you fucking looking at?

1534
01:28:04,375 --> 01:28:05,790
You didn't see nothing!

1535
01:28:08,125 --> 01:28:10,207
(Breathing heavily) Fuck.

1536
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:13,707
That's Ronnie Kray, that, isn't it?

1537
01:28:13,833 --> 01:28:15,207
Fucking hell.

1538
01:28:29,458 --> 01:28:30,499
Reggie.

1539
01:28:31,916 --> 01:28:32,957
Are you mad?

1540
01:28:35,416 --> 01:28:38,332
The Blind Beggar? Yeah, Cornell?

1541
01:28:38,458 --> 01:28:39,707
It's on the fucking radio.

1542
01:28:39,833 --> 01:28:41,665
Reggie.

1543
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:43,665
Hi, Mum.

1544
01:28:45,708 --> 01:28:47,665
Oh. Thank you.

1545
01:28:47,791 --> 01:28:50,707
Oh! Look at you.

1546
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:54,374
Look how handsome you are!

1547
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:58,915
- I'll get you a cup of tea.
- Thanks, Mum.

1548
01:28:59,041 --> 01:29:01,415
- Albie?
- I'm all right, Violet, thank you.

1549
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:09,665
You do look lovely, Reggie.

1550
01:29:11,458 --> 01:29:12,707
How many witnesses?

1551
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:15,040
It was a quiet night.

1552
01:29:15,166 --> 01:29:17,082
- Seven?
- Seven?

1553
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:21,082
Albert Woods was with Cornell.
Plus five regulars, don't know them.

1554
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:24,457
And the barmaid, the blonde, the one
with the big fucking pair of eyes.

1555
01:29:24,583 --> 01:29:25,957
For fuck's sake.

1556
01:29:26,083 --> 01:29:28,457
And you bring this here?
You bring it straight to Mum's?

1557
01:29:28,583 --> 01:29:31,082
Don't moan about it, all right?
It's done, innit?

1558
01:29:31,208 --> 01:29:33,624
What are we gonna do, hmm?

1559
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:35,707
- (Reggie) "We"?
- Yeah.

1560
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,415
Where's the weapon?

1561
01:29:43,541 --> 01:29:45,415
It's here, Reg.

1562
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:50,332
There you go. Now...

1563
01:29:50,458 --> 01:29:52,790
- Here, let me have it.
- (Mother) Would you like a piece of cake?

1564
01:29:52,916 --> 01:29:55,540
Do you know what? That would be lovely.
Yeah. Thank you, Mum.

1565
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:58,874
- It is, it's lovely.
- (Mother chuckles) Thanks.

1566
01:30:01,083 --> 01:30:03,165
I assume you were
in those clothes, right?

1567
01:30:03,291 --> 01:30:05,624
Yeah, yeah.

1568
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,415
So where's his jacket?

1569
01:30:07,541 --> 01:30:08,749
Right, you need to burn that.

1570
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:11,395
And that gun, we need to toss it
in the river right fucking now.

1571
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,082
Go on, fuck off.

1572
01:30:18,458 --> 01:30:20,790
You are...
You're unbelievable.

1573
01:30:22,041 --> 01:30:23,457
Albie?

1574
01:30:23,583 --> 01:30:26,165
Whoever was in that pub,
we need to find out who they are,

1575
01:30:26,291 --> 01:30:29,415
get hold of them and just unravel
whatever they've said to the police.

1576
01:30:29,541 --> 01:30:32,207
We need to undo, so get Big Pat,
Bender, send them down there now.

1577
01:30:32,333 --> 01:30:33,874
- The barmaid I know, right?
- You know her.

1578
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,374
Well, bring her to me,
I'll deal with her myself, all right?

1579
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,540
Go on. Fuck off.

1580
01:30:38,416 --> 01:30:39,832
Oh.

1581
01:30:39,958 --> 01:30:41,790
Where's everybody gone?

1582
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:45,173
Oh, Mum, it's late, it's late.
I wanted them out of your hair, you know.

1583
01:30:45,291 --> 01:30:47,415
You should get some bed time.

1584
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:49,290
Why don't I give you a lift home?
Come on.

1585
01:30:50,041 --> 01:30:52,707
- Oh, it's all right, I am home.
- (Chuckles)

1586
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:56,207
I've made a bed up for him.
He's not well.

1587
01:30:56,333 --> 01:30:58,124
He's...

1588
01:30:58,250 --> 01:30:59,874
He's got a fever.

1589
01:31:00,916 --> 01:31:03,082
- (Sniffs)
- He's going to stay here the night.

1590
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,249
Teddy, would you like to stay with him?

1591
01:31:09,791 --> 01:31:12,790
Thank you, that'd be very nice.
Thank you, Violet.

1592
01:31:19,166 --> 01:31:21,290
Whatever he's done,

1593
01:31:22,541 --> 01:31:24,082
he's your brother.

1594
01:31:26,583 --> 01:31:28,582
Yeah.

1595
01:31:34,125 --> 01:31:35,374
Yeah.

1596
01:31:36,125 --> 01:31:37,915
Well, um...

1597
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:42,290
Here's your Stemetil, mate.

1598
01:31:43,166 --> 01:31:44,999
You should take that.

1599
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:50,082
Do you know what?
I'm going to have to go, actually.

1600
01:31:50,208 --> 01:31:54,415
'Cause, um, I left the lads at work
and I have to clean up.

1601
01:31:55,833 --> 01:31:57,665
So, I'm going to say goodnight.

1602
01:31:57,791 --> 01:31:58,832
Goodnight.

1603
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:05,790
Teddy, now, you couldn't do us a favour,
could you? Be useful.

1604
01:32:05,916 --> 01:32:09,874
And when you take his trousers off tonight
and his shirt, can you burn them?

1605
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,707
Yeah? And check in with me.

1606
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:13,665
- Yeah.
- Good lad.

1607
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:16,457
(Reggie) Night-night.
(Mother) Goodnight.

1608
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:17,707
Goodnight, Reggie.

1609
01:32:23,291 --> 01:32:25,540
- He's lovely, isn't he?
- (Mother chuckles)

1610
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:34,707
(Frances) 'Not even Scotland Yard
could ignore murder on the streets.

1611
01:32:34,833 --> 01:32:36,915
'Nipper was back on the case.'

1612
01:32:37,041 --> 01:32:39,165
Gentlemen, your attention, please.

1613
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:44,332
Now, you've been told that we're
conducting a high-level investigation

1614
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:46,790
into a major corruption allegation.

1615
01:32:46,916 --> 01:32:53,165
In fact, we're going down into the sewer
after the Krays.

1616
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,457
Any man with any objection,
come and see me.

1617
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:05,374
See that lamppost up there, right?

1618
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:08,332
That was known as a safety point
during the war, right?

1619
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:10,040
So, if you could run to that lamppost,

1620
01:33:10,166 --> 01:33:12,415
you knew that you could make it
to the air raid shelter

1621
01:33:12,541 --> 01:33:14,457
before the bombs started dropping.

1622
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,082
One night, right, me and Ron,
we just stood there and we watched.

1623
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,124
We saw the old Stanton house
get blown to bits, they were still in it.

1624
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:27,124
It's a wonder you lived through it.

1625
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:29,915
Yeah, yeah,
especially with Ron, you know.

1626
01:33:30,041 --> 01:33:33,665
Every time trouble came on top, he was
always dragging behind, wasn't he?

1627
01:33:33,791 --> 01:33:36,665
He's got plenty of trouble now,
if the stories are true.

1628
01:33:38,375 --> 01:33:40,457
I heard it on the street, Reggie.

1629
01:33:41,125 --> 01:33:43,082
My own family and you didn't tell me.

1630
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:45,915
Yeah, well, you know,
I didn't want you to worry, did I?

1631
01:33:46,041 --> 01:33:47,624
I don't worry about Ron.

1632
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:50,207
- What do you plan to do about it?
- I'm not gonna let him go to prison.

1633
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:51,999
- Why not?
- Why not?

1634
01:33:53,416 --> 01:33:55,415
Why not? Because he's my brother,
that's why not.

1635
01:33:55,541 --> 01:33:57,124
He'll still be your brother in prison.

1636
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:58,874
No.

1637
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,790
No, Frances, look, he belongs here, right?
He belongs with us.

1638
01:34:01,916 --> 01:34:04,957
He belongs with you, me and his family,
this is his home, all right?

1639
01:34:05,083 --> 01:34:08,457
I've been looking after Ron since we were
little boys, it's just the way it is.

1640
01:34:08,583 --> 01:34:10,999
You can still look after him in prison.

1641
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:13,582
And he doesn't belong here
and you know it.

1642
01:34:14,708 --> 01:34:16,249
Right.

1643
01:34:17,541 --> 01:34:19,790
Right, well, you just don't understand.

1644
01:34:19,916 --> 01:34:21,249
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

1645
01:34:21,375 --> 01:34:24,249
Yes, I do. You once told me
you don't owe the world a thing.

1646
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:26,582
Well, you don't owe Ron a thing, either.

1647
01:34:27,875 --> 01:34:30,832
My loyalty for my brother is how
I measure myself, do you understand?

1648
01:34:30,958 --> 01:34:33,332
What about your loyalty to me,
is that not a measure?

1649
01:34:35,125 --> 01:34:37,915
So... what is going on
with your eyes right now?

1650
01:34:38,041 --> 01:34:41,249
Are you on something?
Are you taking something, Frances?

1651
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:43,790
Are you taking pills again?
Let's have a look.

1652
01:34:43,916 --> 01:34:45,374
- Oh, hello. Look at that.
- Stop it.

1653
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,832
Jesus Christ, how many
of these things are you on?

1654
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:51,249
No wonder you're not making any sense.
You're a pill popper.

1655
01:34:51,375 --> 01:34:53,290
- And who made me that?
- What? A pill popper?

1656
01:34:55,666 --> 01:34:57,749
So, let me get this straight.
What you're saying is that

1657
01:34:57,875 --> 01:34:59,832
in order for us all to be free, yeah,

1658
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:02,165
that we all have to be on our own?

1659
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:06,415
That's great, Frances.
Let's just... I'll go with that.

1660
01:35:06,541 --> 01:35:09,582
- Listen, talk to that barmaid.
- Yeah?

1661
01:35:09,708 --> 01:35:11,874
Tell her when they line the suspects up
across from her

1662
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,249
to point her finger at Ron
and say, "That's him.

1663
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:16,249
"That's the mad hatter what done it."

1664
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:17,957
All right?

1665
01:35:19,041 --> 01:35:21,415
- Where are you going?
- Home.

1666
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,582
- What about me mum?
- Fuck your mum!

1667
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:52,707
- (Nipper) Take your time.
- No.

1668
01:35:53,541 --> 01:35:55,540
The man who shot Cornell,
he's not here.

1669
01:35:56,458 --> 01:35:57,874
Are you sure?

1670
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,249
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sure.

1671
01:36:01,208 --> 01:36:03,540
Please, could someone
just take me home?

1672
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:16,290
Miss.

1673
01:36:20,208 --> 01:36:21,999
- (Donoghue) I swear to God.
- (All laughing)

1674
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:24,749
I smelt something,
I don't know what I smelt.

1675
01:36:24,875 --> 01:36:27,415
There were some good funny looks
in the room towards the judge.

1676
01:36:28,583 --> 01:36:31,207
A bit stinky, he was.

1677
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:33,749
Right?
Am I right or am I wrong?

1678
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:35,665
- No. No.
- Shh.

1679
01:36:35,791 --> 01:36:37,957
Just goes to show,
you can give a dog a bad name,

1680
01:36:38,083 --> 01:36:40,457
but when that dog's name is Kray,
it might bite you back. Well done.

1681
01:36:40,583 --> 01:36:42,374
Well done, Ronnie.
Justice is served.

1682
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:45,165
- Mea culpa. Mea culpa. Eh?
- Drink to my little bunny.

1683
01:36:45,291 --> 01:36:46,624
Welcome home.

1684
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:48,249
(Ron) Maxima.

1685
01:36:48,791 --> 01:36:49,832
It's discipline.

1686
01:36:49,958 --> 01:36:52,415
(Charles) Come and sit down, Vi.
(Mother) No.

1687
01:36:52,541 --> 01:36:55,457

(Gasps)

1690
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,290
What did you tell her?

1691
01:37:20,166 --> 01:37:23,915
I just said, "You might want to think
about your children." You know?

1692
01:37:26,958 --> 01:37:29,165
I wish I could make you go away.

1693
01:37:30,125 --> 01:37:31,999
Well, good luck with that, Frances.

1694
01:37:32,125 --> 01:37:34,207
Yeah. Good fucking luck with that.

(Grunts)

1709
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:31,374
It surprises me
that some people still...

1710
01:38:32,583 --> 01:38:34,707
Still survive these days.

1711
01:38:34,833 --> 01:38:36,582
See you later, Albie.

1712
01:38:39,166 --> 01:38:41,415
- You all right?
- Yeah, go on.

1713
01:38:43,708 --> 01:38:46,207
You all right?
Look like you're struggling there.

1714
01:38:46,333 --> 01:38:47,957
Help me.

1715
01:38:48,083 --> 01:38:51,082
Help you?
What are you doing?

1716
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:53,040
Help me put the top on.

1717
01:38:53,166 --> 01:38:56,082
- Oh, I'm not sure I can help you.
- Reggie, please, it's going to get ruined.

1718
01:38:56,208 --> 01:38:59,165
I can't, can I? I'm a club owner.
You know what I mean?

1719
01:38:59,291 --> 01:39:02,749
I can pick a nice model, all right,
in a nice colour,

1720
01:39:02,875 --> 01:39:05,582
but I'm not very good at anything else.
I'm not a mechanic, am I?

1721
01:39:05,708 --> 01:39:09,249
I'm more of a... a gangster,
isn't that right? Yeah?

1722
01:39:09,375 --> 01:39:10,415
Please help me.

1723
01:39:10,541 --> 01:39:12,832
Please help you?

1724
01:39:12,958 --> 01:39:14,540
(Mimicking Frances) "Please.

1725
01:39:14,666 --> 01:39:16,374
"Please, Reggie."

1726
01:39:17,583 --> 01:39:20,249
All right, let's help you, then.
Go on, then.

1727
01:39:20,375 --> 01:39:21,582
How's that?

1728
01:39:21,708 --> 01:39:24,374
It looks a bit
fucking fucked to me, mate.

1729
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:26,915
Speaking of...

1730
01:39:28,083 --> 01:39:30,290
You look like shit and all.

1731
01:39:41,291 --> 01:39:42,832
Yeah.

1732
01:40:08,208 --> 01:40:09,749
(Door closes)

1733
01:40:15,291 --> 01:40:17,707
What are you doing?
Reggie, stop it!

1734
01:40:17,833 --> 01:40:19,374
Stop it!

1735
01:40:20,416 --> 01:40:22,040
(Panting)

1736
01:40:24,708 --> 01:40:25,790
Reggie!

1737
01:40:28,958 --> 01:40:31,165
- Eh? Stop what?
- Please stop. Please stop.

1738
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:33,999
- Reggie, please stop. Please stop.
- Stop what?

1739
01:40:34,125 --> 01:40:35,540
Please, no!

1740
01:40:35,666 --> 01:40:37,832
(Screaming) Please! No!

1741
01:40:37,958 --> 01:40:39,582
Stop it!

1742
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:50,124
(Ron) ♪ Life goes on without me

1743
01:40:54,541 --> 01:40:56,457
Where are you going?

1744
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:59,832
I'm leaving Reggie.

1745
01:40:59,958 --> 01:41:03,082
Oh, that is a shame,
he will take that very hard.

1746
01:41:03,208 --> 01:41:05,415
Please get out of my way, Ron.

1747
01:41:05,541 --> 01:41:07,707
Unless you prefer me to stay.

1748
01:41:09,875 --> 01:41:12,165
All right, boys, go upstairs. Go on.

1749
01:41:16,083 --> 01:41:17,957
Would you like me
to help you with your bags?

1750
01:41:18,083 --> 01:41:20,374
- No, thank you.
- Oh, come on. Don't be daft.

1751
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:23,040
Look at the size of you,
look at the size of me, come on.

1752
01:41:23,166 --> 01:41:24,707
Come on.

1753
01:41:24,833 --> 01:41:28,165
You know, Frances,
sometimes to achieve greatness,

1754
01:41:28,291 --> 01:41:30,749
you do, you have to cut off
a little piece of yourself

1755
01:41:30,875 --> 01:41:33,582
no matter how much it hurts,
in order to grow, in order to move on.

1756
01:41:33,708 --> 01:41:36,582
It takes courage
and I admire that, you know?

1757
01:41:36,708 --> 01:41:39,749
To be honest,
I think you're getting out just in time.

1758
01:41:39,875 --> 01:41:42,415
- You think so?
- Absolutely, yeah.

1759
01:41:42,541 --> 01:41:44,749
There's so many people
who know so much about us.

1760
01:41:44,875 --> 01:41:47,665
Not you, of course. You know.

1761
01:41:47,791 --> 01:41:50,332
Most people hate us.

1762
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:55,457
Sooner or later, someone's going to talk
and that'll be it, it'll be over.

1763
01:41:55,583 --> 01:41:57,415
That wouldn't be so bad, would it?

1764
01:41:57,541 --> 01:41:59,290
Mmm.

1765
01:42:00,708 --> 01:42:03,582
I think God ought to cut us
some slack, though, don't you think?

1766
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:07,540
Yeah, I'm sure God will.

1767
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:11,249
That is, uh...

1768
01:42:12,083 --> 01:42:13,540
That is bang out of order.

1769
01:42:13,666 --> 01:42:16,457
That's not how we were brought up,
not at all.

1770
01:42:17,375 --> 01:42:18,415
Ron, I've got to go.

1771
01:42:18,541 --> 01:42:21,999
Yeah, course you do.
Listen here, Frances, right?

1772
01:42:23,375 --> 01:42:25,624
We both love him, all right?

1773
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:28,124
We both made the effort.

1774
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:31,499
So we shall just have to see
what happens when we get there.

1775
01:42:33,916 --> 01:42:35,499
Where?

1776
01:42:37,541 --> 01:42:38,582
Heaven.

1777
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:41,249
(Engine starts)

1778
01:42:44,333 --> 01:42:45,374
(Grunts)

1779
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,332
Goodbye, Ron.

1780
01:42:47,958 --> 01:42:49,832
Bye, Frances.

1781
01:42:50,791 --> 01:42:52,749
Listen here,

1782
01:42:53,958 --> 01:42:57,290
I always liked you, Frances,
I always did.

1783
01:42:58,333 --> 01:43:02,249
'Cause you have the ability
to see into the future.

1784
01:43:02,375 --> 01:43:03,999
You do.

1785
01:43:04,916 --> 01:43:06,999
And that's the same as me.

1786
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,832
Bye, now.

1787
01:43:54,125 --> 01:43:56,082
All right, Reggie?

1788
01:43:56,208 --> 01:43:57,999
How are you?

1789
01:43:58,125 --> 01:44:00,582
Yeah. You all right, Frank?
Long time no see, eh?

1790
01:44:00,708 --> 01:44:02,790
- I've been walking straight, you know.
- Oh, yeah?

1791
01:44:02,916 --> 01:44:05,374
- Yeah.
- That's nice, innit?

1792
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:07,957
That's nice.

1793
01:44:08,083 --> 01:44:09,749
What can I do for you?

1794
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,374
Frances here?

1795
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:17,540
It's just that I've been outside your
parents' house the last couple of weeks.

1796
01:44:17,666 --> 01:44:21,124
And they hadn't told me
that she left, so, you know,

1797
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:24,332
I've been standing underneath
her window like a fool.

1798
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:28,999
- Yeah, she's here.
- Yeah, I know.

1799
01:44:30,791 --> 01:44:33,040
- Reggie...
- What?

1800
01:44:35,833 --> 01:44:38,749
I haven't seen her like this
in a long time.

1801
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,249
She's delicate.

1802
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:42,999
Right. All right.

1803
01:44:43,125 --> 01:44:45,415
You tell Frances to come out here
'cause I had to come out here.

1804
01:44:45,541 --> 01:44:48,082
- Why don't you just go and get Frances?
- I'm not letting you see her.

1805
01:44:48,208 --> 01:44:50,582
- Don't fuck about!
- Frank?

1806
01:44:50,708 --> 01:44:52,582
Frances, get back inside.
What are you doing?

1807
01:44:52,708 --> 01:44:53,915
It's OK.

1808
01:44:54,041 --> 01:44:55,665
Hi, Reggie.

1809
01:44:56,375 --> 01:44:57,915
Hello, Frances.

1810
01:44:59,833 --> 01:45:01,082
Have you got a moment?

1811
01:45:02,458 --> 01:45:03,707
Let's have a little chat.

1812
01:45:03,833 --> 01:45:06,082
- It's all right.
- Are you sure about this?

1813
01:45:07,291 --> 01:45:09,582
Go inside and put the kettle on.

1814
01:45:13,125 --> 01:45:14,832
Frankie, come home.

1815
01:45:15,708 --> 01:45:17,290
I am home.

1816
01:45:18,541 --> 01:45:20,582
At least until I find somewhere else.

1817
01:45:20,708 --> 01:45:22,707
I can't go and live with my mum.

1818
01:45:24,291 --> 01:45:26,457
What can I do to change your mind?

1819
01:45:27,708 --> 01:45:29,165
You can't.

1820
01:45:31,083 --> 01:45:32,957
I've changed my mind
about one thing, though.

1821
01:45:33,083 --> 01:45:34,415
What's that?

1822
01:45:35,291 --> 01:45:37,540
I do want you to remember me.

1823
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:40,332
Always.

1824
01:45:41,125 --> 01:45:43,749
That I existed,
that I once walked beside you.

1825
01:45:43,875 --> 01:45:45,082
What are you on about?

1826
01:45:46,083 --> 01:45:47,707
Frankie, come on.

1827
01:45:48,541 --> 01:45:49,874
I always imagined, you know,

1828
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,207
I thought that we might have
a child or two, you know.

1829
01:45:53,416 --> 01:45:56,290
Why? So you could use them
to threaten me?

1830
01:45:56,416 --> 01:45:57,957
No.

1831
01:45:58,833 --> 01:46:00,374
No, because I still love you.

1832
01:46:01,416 --> 01:46:02,874
No.

1833
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,374
No, it's just a thing you say
out of loyalty to something

1834
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,915
- that didn't exist in the first place.
- That's not true.

1835
01:46:08,041 --> 01:46:10,832
Loving you is the only thing
that holds me together.

1836
01:46:15,583 --> 01:46:17,290
You know, I...

1837
01:46:17,416 --> 01:46:20,790
I dreamt that we could live
beyond the place we were meant for.

1838
01:46:22,666 --> 01:46:25,374
But you're a gangster
and you love being one.
