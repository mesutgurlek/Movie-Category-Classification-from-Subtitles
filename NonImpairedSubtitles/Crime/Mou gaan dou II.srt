1
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:11,102
Avici Hell. Also known as Continuous Hell
Uninterrupted time

2
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:15,703
Unlimited space. Boundless suffering
for the fallen souls

3
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,638
Uninterrupted time

4
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,910
l still remember my first arrest

5
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,679
Year: 1991

6
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,321
lt was December 12, 1980

7
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,193
My partner and l were patrolling Hano Road

8
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:40,599
Shit was going down at New World Centre

9
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,665
We rushed over

10
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,334
A gang fight was taking place

11
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,303
About fifteen or so were already down

12
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,802
Lots of blood on the ground

13
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,973
Plus a several hands, still holding a knife

14
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,218
My partner told me to draw my piece

15
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:08,091
l was a rookie so l did what he told

16
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,388
But before l could open the holster

17
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,863
My partner already dropped

18
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:20,205
This kid stabbed a pipe into his belly

19
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,540
Blood gushed out of the sawed off opening

20
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,013
l didn't know what to think

21
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,041
l simply put all six of my bullets

22
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,582
straight into that kid!

23
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,482
l don't remember how many years he got

24
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,955
But when l saw him again two years ago

25
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:46,158
he was boozing in a club, looking sharp

26
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,194
His buddies were all Kwun's goons!

27
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:59,101
Evil prevails. Only the good die young!

28
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,014
l can barely recall my partner's face now.

29
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,949
l regret...

30
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,994
...the six bullets weren't put into
that kid's skull.

31
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,030
The world shouldn't be like this.

32
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,797
lt's not the way to be, Sam.

33
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,480
How long have you been around
Tsim Sha Tsui?

34
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,412
Almost two years now

35
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,818
Do you know why l haven't messed
with you?

36
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,184
'Cause l am handsome!

37
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,317
Maybe so

38
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,898
'Cause l think you're a decent guy.

39
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:59,538
l'd rather you be in charge.

40
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,099
Forget about it !

41
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,372
You couldn't waste the kid even
with six bullets.

42
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,267
That makes you a decent guy, too. Right?

43
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:10,513
l don't want to be one.

44
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,650
Kwun gave me everything, even my life.

45
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:25,395
lf l turned against him

46
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,089
l'd be despicable even in your eyes. Right?

47
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,264
l knew you'd say that.

48
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,703
Chivalry means little to the Ngai Family

49
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,182
The Master often says

50
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,850
"Retribution knows its time"

51
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:55,451
Who knows how you and l will end up?

52
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,492
Time to work!

53
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,394
This early?

54
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,261
l've got to eat! So do my boys!

55
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,996
Take the whole box

56
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,572
That's okay. Keep it !

57
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,209
Don't worry about it! Just go!

58
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,442
Want to use the back door?

59
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,423
Ain't no rules against schmoozing
with cops.

60
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,151
The front door's fine. Got used to it

61
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:45,741
Prat Avenue !

62
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,234
Prat Avenue !

63
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,152
ls Uncle Kwun in?

64
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,793
Uncle Kwun! Someone's looking for you!

65
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,982
Bye, Mary.

66
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,866
They say this American antique's got...

67
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:03,270
...sweet high, crisp middle and strong bass

68
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,639
Bullshit!

69
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,577
180 grand!

70
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,011
Who can afford it in Hong Kong?

71
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,607
Sit.

72
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,385
Only around ten thousand people can
afford it

73
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,719
Sam asked you to be a mole in the force.

74
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,454
lf you don't like it, l can talk to him

75
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,120
You're my boy after all.

76
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:29,823
lt's fine with me

77
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,295
Sure?

78
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,267
Positive.

79
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,505
Hand me that bag.

80
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,643
Mary

81
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,177
l thought you'd been dreading it

82
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:54,386
Hide in Tuen Mun till things quiet down

83
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,121
Stay fit for the Academy's new term

84
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,066
The money l gave you, spend it wisely.

85
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,996
You like the song?

86
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,069
Yeah

87
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,713
lt's yours.

88
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,079
lt won't sound as good on another player

89
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,888
Someday l'll pick out a good one for you

90
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,353
What? Don't like it?

91
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,425
Not at all

92
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,562
Sam gave you this watch, didn't he?

93
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,363
None of your business

94
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,473
Only you and l...

95
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,877
...know about tonight

96
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,045
l don't want Sam to know

97
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,116
Why's that?

98
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,616
Women are simple

99
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,388
A man treats me well, l'd do anything.

100
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,055
Now go home. l'm very busy tonight.

101
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:22,370
lt's either you or me

102
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,709
The boss said l would see blood today

103
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:31,182
The Mainlander kept asking ...

104
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,654
Got a Mercedes today, Keung?

105
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,817
l said, ''Of course.'' And here l am!

106
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,192
Otherwise, l wouldn't be here with you

107
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,733
Mainland girls in arms

108
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,960
That's for sure!

109
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,872
Hey, got a cigarette?

110
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,608
l don't smoke

111
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,096
Let's forget about it. My car's fine

112
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,767
See! She says it's all good

113
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:20,572
Dressed all dandy

114
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,242
Don't want any trouble, do you?

115
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,510
Look at me. All beaten up by you.

116
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,546
Who do you think the judge would believe?

117
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,743
l bet you guys never go to
Tsim Sha Tsui East, huh?

118
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,389
Know who l am? l'm Keung !

119
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,319
Sam's top dog . Del Piero's boy

120
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,154
l'll kick your ass every time l see you

121
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,328
And you can count on that

122
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,653
How about calling an ambulance, sir?

123
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,483
Look at all the blood!

124
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,156
Have them bring 500 cc Type O. lt's rare!

125
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,552
Shut up!

126
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,729
Wait till we're back to the station

127
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,230
Why do l have to go to the station?

128
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:23,991
l only stole a piece of junk, sir!

129
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:24,864
What've l done to deserve the OCTB?

130
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:25,698
Just shut up!

131
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,496
Does that deserve an OCTB beating?

132
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,503
Don't you know you're just a cadet?

133
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,503
And you are expected to get a medal
this year.

134
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:33,901
Don't ever let Yip know about this!

135
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,888
Happy birthday!

136
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,093
What's there to be happy about?

137
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:53,189
Ten years in the Academy. A rustic hell !

138
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,602
You even managed to get me out

139
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,567
Your case's now ancient history

140
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,536
Get yourself out

141
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,973
So what if the Commissioner's Chinese
now?

142
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,444
Still six more years till the hand over

143
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,717
l'll be 48 by then!

144
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:18,979
Might as well train a few good cops here!

145
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,885
The world is yours after 1997!

146
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,864
27 149! Cheers!

147
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,298
Yan

148
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,695
Been beeping the whole day

149
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,665
How come you don't call back?

150
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:31,962
Girlfriend?

151
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,405
Cheers, sir! Cheers!

152
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,233
Just leave me alone!

153
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:37,636
lt's none of my business
l don't want to know a thing

154
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,175
Go! Leave me alone!

155
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,174
Law

156
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,311
What do you want?

157
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,379
My father just passed way

158
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,292
lt was his wish to inform his children...

159
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,159
when something bad happened to him!

160
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,560
Sorry to have bothered you!

161
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,089
Stop watching TV! Eat first, Negro!

162
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:36,223
l wonder what they have on Kwun's death

163
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,863
Did you do it, Ching?

164
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,072
l've got a big mouth. Had l done it...

165
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,469
...you would've heard about it!

166
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:44,802
Ask Wah and Gandhi

167
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,475
When Kwun died, l was in Macau

168
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,707
Everybody knows!

169
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,146
But l bet his kids think l did it

170
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,447
l ain't scared of nothing

171
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,181
The eldest son's a doctor
The youngest a brat

172
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,483
The daughter's married for ages

173
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,819
Only the middle son's running the show

174
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:06,464
lf they go too far, l'll show them!

175
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,533
We failed to protect Kwun. lt's our fault!

176
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,490
That's enough, Uncle John !

177
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,264
Dad used to say

178
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,339
What goes around comes around

179
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,469
lt came later than expected already

180
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,875
Wah, Ching, Negro and Gandhi

181
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,017
Guess what those four are thinking?

182
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,658
Thank you. Thank you all!

183
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,722
How's mom doing, sis?

184
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,392
She's fine. Been sleeping

185
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:46,834
Bring some cigs to the morgue for dad

186
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,264
l'll go get them

187
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,139
B Team, watch Tak Shing Street

188
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,013
C Team, watch the Austin Road exit...

189
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,450
...of that financial building

190
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:04,987
lt has two exits

191
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,920
One on Tak Shing Street. One on Austin...

192
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,115
Sorry

193
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,496
Hello?

194
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,963
Something this big, why didn't you call?

195
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,062
l called everybody the minute it happened!

196
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,171
Kwun's boys can't sit still for sure

197
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,898
Shit will hit the fan tonight!

198
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,404
lt's the 14th already. You know that?

199
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,040
The 14th. Time to pay the Ngai Family

200
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,906
l'm the youngest here

201
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,745
So let me be the jackass

202
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,287
l'm not paying the Ngai's any more

203
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,617
What do you three think?

204
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,177
lnspector Wong

205
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,070
What's up?

206
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,577
What're your men doing outside
Wah's building?

207
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:37,940
Not a good day for chit chat

208
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:38,811
Are you into something?

209
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,475
Fine, fine. Next time

210
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,921
What's the occasion?

211
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,022
Come on. Where's my seat?

212
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,066
Only if you're here for the food

213
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,573
All other businesses have to wait

214
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,832
The food. lt's all about the food

215
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,745
Tonight's gonna be the shit!

216
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,985
Let the Big Four do their things

217
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,316
We'll deal with the aftermath

218
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,484
Don't let them start fighting

219
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,625
Or you'll see bodies

220
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,456
What? Not satisfied?

221
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:30,062
You know the rule. Pick a card

222
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:31,764
Okay. Higher points win

223
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:32,961
Come on!

224
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,947
There's nothing left to talk about

225
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,652
What's up, Hau?

226
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,116
Wah

227
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:55,354
Nothing much

228
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,961
Heard you're planning a casino in Macau

229
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,232
l've got the government in my pocket

230
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,162
How about a joint venture?

231
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,432
Uncle Kwun's dead

232
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:06,865
l'm not in the mood

233
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,733
l see

234
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,078
The Macau trip wasn't all business

235
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,416
l know you had fun with Gandhi's wife

236
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,606
Sorry, but l can't let go of my casino
in Macau

237
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:51,771
Gotta go

238
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,299
What are Sam's people doing?

239
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,466
l know Wah paid up

240
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,041
Don't change the subject

241
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,406
Tell me something l don't know!

242
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,706
Call me when you get your shit straight!

243
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,819
Hau took care of Wah in ten minutes

244
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:35,460
The Big Four are having a tough time

245
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,731
Hau took out a million's worth of coke

246
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:57,605
What?

247
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,617
Mafia road block or what?

248
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:14,965
l don't know why Wah paid up, Hau

249
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,293
But l ain't gonna negotiate

250
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,799
l don't plan to negotiate, either

251
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,061
Pass the phone to Negro

252
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,836
Hey, Negro

253
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:25,002
Don't know why he calls you from my hood

254
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:28,971
What's up, Hau?

255
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,845
l'm with Gandhi all the way

256
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,945
He's not paying, neither will l!

257
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,656
Heard you and Gandhi have been tight

258
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:43,691
The heroin you two smuggled got robbed

259
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,054
Lost several millions each, right?

260
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,930
Luckily l found the stuff in your warehouse

261
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,469
Want me to hand it back to Gandhi now?

262
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,467
What's he talking about?

263
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,386
Among the Tsim Sha Tsui Big Fives...

264
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,585
Wah and Negro paid up

265
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,523
Counting Sam, that's 3 to 2

266
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:23,561
l'm the youngest here. Gotta pay!

267
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,028
See ya!

268
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:35,306
Don't think too much. Cheers!

269
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,021
Pay my share for me!

270
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,362
Mr. Ngai went to eat, lnspector Wong

271
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,392
A bit late for chowing, don't you think?

272
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,405
My dad always came here after work

273
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,403
l have to keep up the ritual

274
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,411
Want to join us?

275
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,381
lt's your seat from now on. Must be tough

276
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:48,649
Not at all

277
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,522
You guys worked all night for nothing

278
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,250
Now that's tough

279
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,729
Well done, Hau

280
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,826
Hope you can keep it up

281
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,997
Don't let it turn into a tragedy. Let's go

282
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,600
What did you say?

283
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,000
We want to celebrate

284
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,073
Kwun's dead

285
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,110
Time to pop the champagne

286
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,322
Want me to pop one for you?

287
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,190
What?

288
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,865
Want to mess with cops?

289
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,299
Officers!

290
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,670
The Ngai's are in mourning

291
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,676
What more do you want?

292
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,979
Let's go

293
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:04,159
Sam

294
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,674
Dad used to operate street gambling here

295
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,975
Started out as...

296
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,716
a dime and nickel business

297
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,456
Now who doesn't know his name?

298
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,132
He often said

299
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,333
What goes around comes around

300
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,132
And now he's...

301
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,710
l'll always remember this day

302
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:50,261
lt's all good, honey. Want some snacks?

303
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:53,403
Good to hear that. Just come home

304
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,180
27 1 49

305
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,641
An officer has to have a clean background

306
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:12,683
Though you cut your ties with the Ngai's...

307
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,891
...you still share the same father with Hau

308
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,491
That means you lied on your application

309
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,426
l have but to let you go

310
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,161
But before you leave...

311
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,500
...go see ''Mr. Wrong Socks'' first

312
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,469
Still want to be a cop?

313
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:40,716
Can l still?

314
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,321
Only if you can give me a good reason

315
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,683
l want to be a righteous person

316
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,086
lf you want to be a cop...

317
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,458
...then lend me a hand. Simple as that

318
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,263
You pick me 'cause l'm Hau's brother,
right?

319
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,803
When the time comes,
will you arrest him yourself?

320
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:38,970
How do l start?

321
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,373
Brace

322
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:33,553
You okay?

323
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,797
Hanging in there?

324
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,167
What's wrong?

325
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:21,005
Does it still hurt?

326
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,876
My dad passed away today

327
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,914
He was so good to me

328
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,714
l asked the officer...

329
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:35,292
...if l could go to his funeral

330
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,022
The officer said...

331
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,865
Know what it means to be a prisoner?

332
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:48,201
lt means you're not allowed

333
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:51,334
even to attend your father's funeral

334
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,407
Don't you know that?

335
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,171
Get out of here!

336
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,737
Come on. Stop that

337
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:41,616
Year: 1 995

338
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,646
Are you nuts?

339
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,118
You sent Yan to be a mole?

340
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,185
Don't you know Hau's his half brother?

341
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,288
So what?

342
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,161
Bring me his file!

343
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,743
So you're playing the boss now, huh?

344
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:37,741
You damn well know you the files
are classified

345
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,779
l treat you like a bro. ls this what l get?

346
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,510
lf you're a real bro, stop asking !

347
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,062
lt's okay

348
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,166
Calm down!

349
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,028
Speak slowly!

350
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,995
She had an abortion!

351
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,866
lt's no big deal. Just a baby

352
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:15,444
You can always have another one

353
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,782
l've been with you for four years

354
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,313
And l've bailed you out tons of times

355
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,120
One minute we're dining with my folks...

356
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,226
...the next you'll be in a gang fight

357
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,395
l don't want our baby to grow up like you

358
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,498
Do you understand?

359
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,629
Why so uptight?

360
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:07,728
No, nothing

361
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,162
Uncle John says you're doing well

362
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,369
Ever thought about helping the family out?

363
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,911
l know you want to keep a distance
from the Ngai's

364
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,810
But we're blood brothers. lt's a fact

365
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,521
lt's my daughter's birthday this Sunday

366
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,319
You're invited

367
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,425
You really hate talking to me, huh?

368
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:41,155
No

369
00:36:56,447 --> 00:37:00,178
Promoted already?
Soon you'll be a superintendent

370
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,883
Might as well become a full time cop

371
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,488
Sam's kidding . Go ahead,
give me a smile

372
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,257
Thanks for your intel these couple years

373
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,464
When you were still a rookie...

374
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:21,137
l helped you catch some small potatoes

375
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,433
lt's about time you caught some big shots

376
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:25,836
How about catching me?

377
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,376
Why so dirty? Or you can catch
this hot chicks

378
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:30,946
What're you doing?!

379
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,378
What a hot hootchie mama!

380
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:36,111
Your man must be
one good looking bastard

381
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,787
lt's you! Who else?

382
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,055
Gotta go

383
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:43,420
Gotta go meet Mr. Ngai

384
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,936
Sam's so good to you!

385
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,276
But he's not good to himself

386
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,013
lt's been four years

387
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,748
He could be in charge now

388
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,719
But he gave everything to the Ngai's
Already?

389
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,588
Now the Ngai Family's all big and bad

390
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:26,295
Hau must've figured it out

391
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:28,934
For the past four years

392
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:31,905
l haven't been sleeping well

393
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,706
l'm lnspector Wong Chi Shing

394
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,810
Don't worry, Mary

395
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:38,814
l won't let anything happen to you

396
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,685
Words, words, words

397
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:45,817
l promise

398
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:24,956
Toss it up!

399
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:36,801
Two days ago, a real estate agent came

400
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,238
Guess how much he offered?

401
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,944
One hundred sixty million!

402
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,082
What's wrong with Hong Kong? Tell me!

403
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,811
When my dad bought it

404
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:51,452
it was 9 million...280 thousand

405
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,346
What a world!

406
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:54,855
Moving, Mr. Ngai?

407
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,787
1997 is approaching . Time to emigrate

408
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:00,895
No big deal

409
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,123
Communication's easy these days

410
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,425
We're just a phone call away

411
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:08,128
l'm just worried about the phone bill

412
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,740
The phone company's greedy, you know

413
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,409
l've discussed it with mom

414
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:19,276
Our businesses are on the right track

415
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,508
You guys helped out so much in the past

416
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:27,022
l don't want to be ungrateful

417
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:30,024
l want to split the business up...

418
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,953
...among you guys

419
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:36,589
Treat it as a gift or a retirement fund

420
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,504
Let's eat! Take whatever you want!

421
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,233
We should hang out like this more often

422
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:55,952
Mr. Ngai

423
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:57,948
Are you leaving for real?

424
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:04,292
After you're gone, hell will break loose!

425
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,824
You're a Buddhist, aren't you, Sam?

426
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,833
Easy to start. Hard to let go

427
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,928
l'm letting go. Be happy for me

428
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,439
l've thought about it

429
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,607
Cocaine will be the future

430
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:26,673
Those four ship it in small bags
from S. America

431
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,476
Small timers!

432
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:32,422
l've closed a deal with the Thais

433
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,319
You'll have the monopoly

434
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,520
You'll be the top dog . Leader of the pack

435
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,961
Go to Thailand and wrap up the logistics

436
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,604
You plan to get rid of those four?

437
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,496
Move closer to the right, please

438
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,125
Yan

439
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:21,601
Come join the family portrait

440
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:27,405
Stand next to me!

441
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:37,454
l haven't been around much
these two years

442
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:38,679
lt's rare to spend time...

443
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:42,417
...with the whole family like this

444
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:47,194
Your siblings are in legit businesses

445
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,428
lt's time you helped out the family

446
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:54,569
Everything dad did was for the family

447
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,365
l did the same

448
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,306
Hope you will, too

449
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:08,283
A deal's coming up next week
Come with me

450
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:12,921
l'll call you

451
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:44,285
l think he's taking the deal seriously

452
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,885
He'll go in person next Wednesday

453
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:51,389
The 1 4th... Kwun's memorial

454
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:53,120
Hau wants to whack the Big Four

455
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,825
Why does he send Sam away?

456
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,764
Don't know. Sam should be of help to him!

457
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,606
Unless he wants to kill Sam also!

458
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,721
l've been following you around for days!

459
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:28,457
l'm your superior after all

460
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,663
l want to know what your plan is

461
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,535
The Ngai's are your family

462
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,507
Do you really know what you're doing?

463
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:51,385
l'm a cop!

464
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,023
Good

465
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:57,585
Give me a salute

466
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:05,697
l've booked a table. Care for dinner?

467
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,099
Do l look good in my cap?

468
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:28,983
Looking good?

469
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,322
What'll you do in Thailand in that outfit?

470
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,091
Have some shark fin

471
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:37,823
A massage. Get two whores
for a threesome

472
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:39,026
That's for sure

473
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:43,471
Honey!

474
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,629
What?

475
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,537
Why didn't you tell me about your trip?

476
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,575
lt's a business trip! Not for fun!

477
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,107
Don't worry. l'll behave

478
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:53,910
Hau plans to whack Wah and those guys

479
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:56,643
l know

480
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:59,348
But do you know you're his target too?

481
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:03,326
Nonsense! How can that be?

482
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:06,424
Just wait for me at the airport!

483
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:09,893
Time to board, Sam!

484
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,847
That's all l can do for now

485
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:35,622
Call Sam again when the plane lands

486
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,727
l'm going to kill Hau tonight

487
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:43,930
Don't do anything rash!

488
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,100
l'm not being rash!

489
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,705
Four years ago...

490
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:54,674
...you told me to kill Kwun

491
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,013
So what? Want to blackmail me now?

492
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,350
l'm not blackmailing you

493
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:12,487
We simply passed the point of no return!

494
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,020
l'll send everybody away

495
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:50,229
Tonight's operation's top secret

496
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:51,961
We're divided into three teams

497
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,232
Team A watches here

498
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,397
Team B here

499
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,633
Wait for my order before doing anything

500
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,172
Team C follows the target until...

501
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,183
Nobody told me about the date change!

502
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:12,653
You know Hau changes his mind
all the time

503
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:18,293
You think Yan's the only mole?

504
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,427
My man's been undercover
for seven years!

505
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:22,954
Where's the deck of cards?

506
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,907
We'll run the show together tonight

507
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:43,943
Let's go!

508
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:55,106
Sir

509
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:56,776
How are you?

510
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,658
Hau

511
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:20,533
Zipping it till your lawyer gets here?

512
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,036
Come on, cooperate with us!

513
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:27,703
ln fact, l appreciate your cooperation

514
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:30,375
Are you speaking Zen, Mr. Ngai?

515
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:31,639
l don't get it

516
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:36,777
Dad used to say...

517
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:41,784
... the way things work in the streets...

518
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:43,756
... what goes around always comes around

519
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:49,232
He died four years ago. lt's about time

520
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:00,871
The stove's hot enough now

521
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:18,926
She's here, boss

522
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,467
You're here now

523
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:05,532
What can you swing?

524
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,168
Wait and see

525
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,205
Got it! Sir

526
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,041
The two foreigners are private eyes

527
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:26,255
Honey! Where are you?

528
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:27,749
Thailand, of course

529
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:29,520
Come back right away!

530
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,517
Are you nuts? Why should l come back?

531
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:33,663
Don't ask questions! Just come back!

532
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,629
Hau wants you dead!

533
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,890
Nonsense! l'm working for him
as we speak!

534
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:39,796
Listen to me!

535
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:44,772
l killed Kwun!

536
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:56,913
You've got a VCR?

537
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:03,221
lsn't it good?

538
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,455
What an awesome show!

539
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:10,858
Take care. Run if you have to

540
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,365
What did Hau say?

541
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,312
Sam. Sunny!

542
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:33,055
Mr. Ngai told me to take good care of you!

543
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,095
Four years ago...

544
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,862
...you told me to kill Kwun

545
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,196
So what? Want to blackmail me now?

546
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,735
l'm not blackmailing you

547
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,704
We simply passed the point of no return!

548
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:38,811
l'll send everybody away

549
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:45,248
l hired Alan and Johnson...

550
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:50,516
...to investigate my father's murder

551
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,794
Who would've known?
The police conspired...

552
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:04,831
to murder my father

553
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:08,842
A law abiding citizen

554
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,309
SP Luk

555
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,416
lsn't that an officer in the video?

556
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:41,132
Whether to nail him or not...

557
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:43,009
...that's up to you

558
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,098
What a good show!

559
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:42,731
You're so friggin' photogenic

560
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,774
Four years ago...

561
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,536
How much did Sam's woman pay you?

562
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:29,976
Give me another chance, Mr. Ngai

563
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:05,583
l gave them a chance four years ago

564
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:07,520
They didn't take it

565
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:12,391
lf l give you a chance

566
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,056
Are you going to take it today?

567
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,545
You've been with us for seven years now

568
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,347
You're a cop

569
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:41,019
We're the bad guys

570
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:43,417
Time to accept our fates

571
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,131
You can't blame me

572
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:54,670
Your lnspector Wong killed my dad
