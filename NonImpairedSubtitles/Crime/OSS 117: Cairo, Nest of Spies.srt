1
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,085
Take the briefcase, Rubecht.

2
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:36,276
<i>Ja wohl, Herr Colonel!</i>

3
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:40,522
Hurry! I want to take off now!

4
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:50,199
Get moving, Rubecht!

5
00:00:50,407 --> 00:00:51,635
Idiot.

6
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:08,836
Sleeping, Rubecht?

7
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:21,396
Asleep...

8
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:24,801
You're not Rubecht!

9
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:27,961
Not even German!
Give me the briefcase!

10
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:31,840
Hand it over
or I'll riddle you with bullets!

11
00:01:32,047 --> 00:01:32,843
Never!

12
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:36,517
Don't be stupid.
I have a gun. You don't.

13
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,516
Idiot!

14
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:49,835
Looking for this?

15
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:52,721
- What do you want?
- The V2 blueprints.

16
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:57,446
No way! Get in the cockpit
and take me to South America!

17
00:01:57,647 --> 00:01:58,796
Or else?

18
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:02,476
I'll jump...
And bye-bye blueprints!

19
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:04,359
Which ones? These?

20
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:07,557
Newspapers?

21
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:09,520
Newspapers!

22
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:12,160
Who are you?

23
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:15,919
OSS 117...

24
00:02:16,607 --> 00:02:17,437
At your service.

25
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:19,205
I should have guessed!

26
00:02:21,287 --> 00:02:23,118
<i>Auf wiedershen, Herr Colonel!</i>

27
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:26,635
And thank you for flying
OSS 117 Airways!

28
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:34,196
- You okay, Jack?
- Yes, Hubert.

29
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:36,637
Come on.
We have a plane to fly.

30
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:40,602
I'm coming.

31
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:01,517
There's one thing that baffles me.

32
00:03:01,727 --> 00:03:04,082
Why keep the briefcase
if you had the plans?

33
00:03:04,287 --> 00:03:06,198
I'll never give into barbarism.

34
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:07,642
Oh yeah. Same here.

35
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:07,361
Reptile!

36
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:11,160
Start by playing nice.
Then we can get nasty.

37
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:14,405
Traitor!
I saw straight through you.

38
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:15,796
You don't say!

39
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:19,557
You're French secret service.
Agent OSS 117.

40
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:22,520
Numbered like a cow
lead to slaughter.

41
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:24,720
At your service.

42
00:05:25,447 --> 00:05:26,926
And I know who you are.

43
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,846
You're not a Lebanese reporter
based in Rome,

44
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:33,126
but the niece
of Egypt's King Farouk.

45
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:35,887
I'm his niece,
but he's no longer king.

46
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,760
He was exiled 3 years ago
by the vile Nasser!

47
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:41,276
May the maggot rot in hell.

48
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:44,206
You're pretty vulgar
for a Pharaoh's niece.

49
00:05:45,207 --> 00:05:46,606
My uncle is King.

50
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:49,082
The pharaohs ruled 4000 years ago!

51
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:51,402
I knew that.

52
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:56,000
In any case, Princess,
you have what I need.

53
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:59,040
Pig! You'll pay
for having betrayed me!

54
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:00,475
We'll see about that.

55
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:02,837
Before you go, filthy spy...

56
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:03,957
make love to me.

57
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:05,122
I don't think so.

58
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,204
- Why not?
- Don't feel like it.

59
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:11,041
- It was the cow joke.
- I take it back.

60
00:06:11,447 --> 00:06:12,562
Thank you.

61
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:14,762
Tied up.

62
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:18,238
Gagged too?

63
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,725
Come here, snake!

64
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:45,237
Make it fast.
I only have a few hours.

65
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:02,367
- How's the veal stew?
- Excellent.

66
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:08,481
How's the veal stew?

67
00:07:08,807 --> 00:07:12,117
Excellent.
Nice to see you, Hubert.

68
00:07:12,327 --> 00:07:14,716
- Here's the envelope.
- Let's see.

69
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:22,397
- My God!
- What's wrong?

70
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:23,881
Very bad news.

71
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:27,357
Jack!

72
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:33,196
Jack...

73
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:06,320
OSS 283 was our agent in Egypt.

74
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,523
We've had no news for the past month.
Now I know why.

75
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:12,837
- What's going on there?
- It's a mess.

76
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:16,125
The Americans and Russians
are fighting as usual.

77
00:08:16,407 --> 00:08:19,444
The English want complete control
of the Suez Canal.

78
00:08:19,647 --> 00:08:23,003
To top it off,
a Russian cargo ship went missing.

79
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:24,481
The "Kapov".

80
00:08:25,007 --> 00:08:26,963
Not to mention the Eagles of Keops.

81
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,806
Religious extremists
who want to take over.

82
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:31,561
Potent cocktail.

83
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:34,843
The higher-ups are getting nervous.

84
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:38,164
- President Coty?
- Yes... President Coty.

85
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:45,957
Your turn... What'll it be?

86
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:47,759
- How's the veal stew?
- Excellent.

87
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:48,604
Hubert?

88
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:51,799
Two veal stews.
I hear your herring is good.

89
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:54,805
We'll get you a side order.
Judge for yourself.

90
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:58,165
We need you there.

91
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,835
A specialist in the Arabo-Muslim world.

92
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:02,595
- Arabo...?
- Muslim.

93
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:07,520
Find what Jefferson discovered
and who killed him.

94
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:08,722
Count on me.

95
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:11,521
Figure out a way
to calm them all down:

96
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:13,763
Americans, Russians, English...

97
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:17,240
Buttress French policy.
Establish peace.

98
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:19,205
- Sure.
- Make the Middle East safe.

99
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:20,841
No problem.

100
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:24,957
Your contact will meet you
at the airport, by the globe.

101
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,556
- The usual procedure?
- Exactly.

102
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:35,082
You're Lucien Bramard, businessman.
Jack Jefferson's partner.

103
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:39,600
Enjoy Cairo, OSS 117.
Land of pharaohs and pyramids.

104
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:41,877
And a veritable nest of spies.

105
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:02,959
He just arrived.

106
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,760
How is the veal stew?

107
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:25,403
Excuse me?

108
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:29,237
Are the meat dishes here
of good quality?

109
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:32,881
Yeah...

110
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:35,281
Good?

111
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:37,964
If you like meat, yeah.

112
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:39,556
With veal?

113
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:42,486
Mostly lamb, I think.

114
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:43,836
There's chicken too.

115
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:48,245
There's nothing with veal?
And mushrooms and potatoes...

116
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:50,355
I don't know.

117
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,795
Goodbye, sir.

118
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:53,400
Have a nice day.

119
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,837
How is your veal stew?

120
00:11:08,847 --> 00:11:10,200
Excellent.

121
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:12,439
I hear your herring is good.

122
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:15,559
We'll get you a side order.
Judge for yourself.

123
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:18,926
Larmina El Akmar Betouche,
Jack's secretary.

124
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:20,116
Tough name.

125
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:23,125
Hubert Bonnisseur de la Bath.
Here, Lucien Bramard.

126
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:24,840
- My pleasure.
- No, mine.

127
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:27,686
Let's go.
This airport is a nest of spies.

128
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:44,518
- Cigarette?
- No, I don't smoke.

129
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:46,566
I haven't acquired a taste.

130
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:51,086
Too bad. It's relaxing.
Especially in your line of work.

131
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:53,801
It pisses me off.
Not smoking kills me.

132
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,085
I'll keep trying, I promise.

133
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,195
Nice car.

134
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,680
Shame it's so dirty.

135
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:04,639
We have a lot of dust here.

136
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:06,200
You're telling me!

137
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:09,001
Chickens and watermelons
in the streets!

138
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:12,120
But it's sort of fun.

139
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:13,761
Fun?

140
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:17,798
Egypt led the world for 2000 years.

141
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:20,601
We invented
astronomy and mathematics.

142
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:24,322
Your archeologists are still stymied
by our pyramids,

143
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:26,085
Mr. Bonnisseur de la Bath.

144
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:31,322
Bramard. Lucien Bramard.

145
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:36,566
Your French is perfect.

146
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:39,645
We've spoken French for ages,
but the Rais...

147
00:12:39,887 --> 00:12:40,603
The...?

148
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:43,196
Rais. The leader. Our president.

149
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:44,635
Nasser.

150
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:48,206
Nasser is making Arabic
the sole language.

151
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:50,796
The problem with Arabic is
it's hard to read.

152
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,318
Even the sounds are...

153
00:12:55,327 --> 00:12:57,079
But it's nice. Really nice.

154
00:12:57,287 --> 00:13:00,438
Arabic is spoken by millions.
Writing it is an art.

155
00:13:03,127 --> 00:13:04,480
Millions?

156
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:08,876
You're sweet, but do you know
how much a million is?

157
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,119
Yes, I think I do.

158
00:13:14,647 --> 00:13:17,002
You must be careful, Mr. Bramard.

159
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:19,284
Egyptians hate English occupation.

160
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,206
Foreigners aren't appreciated
these days.

161
00:13:22,407 --> 00:13:26,036
Considering your riches,
I see why foreigners want to stay...

162
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:28,355
and nestle close.

163
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:35,563
<i>Suez Canal</i>
<i>Panoramic View</i>

164
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,600
It's breathtaking.

165
00:13:52,487 --> 00:13:53,886
I love panoramic views.

166
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:55,880
This one is stunning.

167
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:58,717
Your civilization truly is grandiose.

168
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,806
To build this 4000 years ago
was visionary.

169
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,567
The Suez Canal was built 86 years ago.

170
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:06,596
Really?

171
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:09,836
But what a source of national pride!

172
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:13,517
It has international status.
An English company runs it.

173
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,240
Nothing here is Egyptian.

174
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:18,839
Except for the workers killed
while building it.

175
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:19,957
What is it?

176
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,046
My father died here.

177
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:24,676
Building the canal?

178
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:28,363
Playing paddle ball. The string broke.
The ball flew off.

179
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,478
The current carried him away.

180
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:32,876
He was a true saint.

181
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,558
Egypt has suffered a great loss.

182
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:43,721
Tell me, Larmina...

183
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:47,285
what was Jack working on?

184
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:50,559
A stockpile of weapons had disappeared.

185
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:53,680
He was supposed to meet
an informer in Ismaila.

186
00:14:54,447 --> 00:14:56,085
I haven't seen him since.

187
00:14:56,487 --> 00:14:57,840
- Strange.
- Isn't it?

188
00:14:58,247 --> 00:15:00,966
Strange...
You see this car behind me?

189
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,195
I've been watching it.

190
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:06,962
- And?
- It's perfectly dust-free!

191
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:09,119
Isn't a clean car nicer?

192
00:15:10,647 --> 00:15:12,922
Someday I'll give your chassis
a polish.

193
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:27,366
<i>Cairo</i>

194
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:37,485
We're here.
This is the S.C.E.P.

195
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,996
- The...
- S.C.E.P. Your cover.

196
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:42,924
Come here. This is Slimane.

197
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:46,164
Foreman, caretaker...
the pillar of the company!

198
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:47,766
Welcome, sir.

199
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,286
Thank you, Slimane.

200
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:53,083
You feel like an orphan
since Mr. Jefferson left.

201
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,522
Rest assured. I'm here now.

202
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:59,242
I'm Lucien Bramard, your new boss.
And your friend.

203
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:00,403
Thank you, sir.

204
00:16:00,607 --> 00:16:03,485
To seal our friendship,
I have something for you.

205
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:09,643
Look, this is our "Rais".
Mr. René Coty. A great man.

206
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:11,526
He'll go down in history.

207
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:15,079
He likes people from Madagascar,
Morocco and Senegal.

208
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,759
He is your friend.
This will bring you luck.

209
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:20,403
Thank you.

210
00:16:23,887 --> 00:16:24,956
Jack...

211
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,845
What are you doing?

212
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:08,605
Welcome to the S.C.E.P.!

213
00:17:16,727 --> 00:17:17,682
What's this?

214
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,718
Society of Chicken
and Egyptian Poultry.

215
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:22,919
Mr. Jefferson raised chickens.
Now you do!

216
00:17:25,407 --> 00:17:26,237
Great.

217
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:29,803
450 hens, 110 roosters, 150 chickens!
This is the S.C.E.P.

218
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:34,442
- What's the smell?
- Chickens!

219
00:17:34,647 --> 00:17:36,478
- And the noise?
- Chickens too!

220
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:39,402
They stop it
when the lights go off.

221
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:41,115
How strange.

222
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:43,563
It's true.

223
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:46,327
Mr. Jefferson's office
is down the hall.

224
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,164
How humorous.

225
00:18:08,207 --> 00:18:10,323
Who are you?
Why are you here?

226
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:12,916
Calm down, calm down.

227
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:17,083
This is Gerhard Moeller,
the head of the S.C.E.B.

228
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:18,925
Society of Cows
and Egyptian Beef

229
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:21,687
That doesn't answer my second question.

230
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:23,443
Which one?

231
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:26,556
Why are you here?

232
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:30,437
I came to inquire
how my friend Jefferson is doing.

233
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:32,719
It's been a while.

234
00:18:33,007 --> 00:18:35,567
He's in Jordan.
Big chicken market there.

235
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:38,281
You've put me at ease.
Thank you.

236
00:18:39,127 --> 00:18:41,561
We haven't had the pleasure
of meeting.

237
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:46,760
It's a small world here.
Everyone knows everyone.

238
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:49,198
Lucien Bramard. Jack's partner.

239
00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:52,523
Very well.
Pleased to meet you.

240
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:58,966
Welcome to Cairo.

241
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,126
Beware of him.
Jack didn't like him.

242
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:08,560
Don't worry.
If there's something to uncover,

243
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:14,766
I'll uncover it.

244
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,523
Come to tonight's Embassy reception.

245
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:32,959
I'd be delighted. A perfect occasion
to wear my alpaca tuxedo.

246
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:36,921
I guess. And to butter up
to the cream of high society.

247
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:41,879
I try to avoid rich foods.

248
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:47,443
Because you said butter and cream.

249
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,802
Two rich foods: Butter and cream.

250
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:53,720
Cream of high society...

251
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,443
Avoid rich foods... It's a pun.

252
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:01,761
- I'll pick you up at seven.
- Excellent.

253
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:16,677
Bramard.

254
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:18,161
Yes, sir?

255
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:22,796
I have a reservation.

256
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:24,838
Ah yes. Please sign here.

257
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:33,078
Thank you, Mr. Bramard.

258
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:35,560
Welcome to Egypt.

259
00:20:35,927 --> 00:20:38,236
I think that man is waiting for you.

260
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:44,486
He's here.
He checked into the hotel.

261
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:49,285
How is your goulash?

262
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:51,045
How is your goulash?

263
00:20:53,527 --> 00:20:54,676
How is what?

264
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,400
How is what?

265
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:07,240
Thank you. Here.

266
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:08,641
No thank you.

267
00:21:08,927 --> 00:21:10,440
But it's René Coty!

268
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:19,761
Welcome to Egypt, 117.

269
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:22,201
Princess!

270
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:25,203
It's always so enchanting
to see you.

271
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:28,035
- Thank you, Hubert.
- Don't mention it.

272
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:31,436
What's that smell?
Could it be chicken?

273
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:37,116
Let's say it's me.

274
00:21:37,327 --> 00:21:38,726
Give the envelope back.

275
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:40,485
- Why should I?
- That's why.

276
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:30,716
I love to fight.

277
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,881
Princess, why do you want
that envelope?

278
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:27,726
- My lips are sealed, ape.
- As you like.

279
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:28,757
Totally sealed.

280
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:31,686
Now we're even.
I won't make love to you.

281
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:36,757
Obviously, I could use
this tool of mine.

282
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:41,362
It's called... a revolver.

283
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:45,524
It's unsealed lots of lips.
Of both men and women.

284
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:48,276
You load it and unload it,
like this.

285
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:49,676
Load,

286
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:50,916
unload.

287
00:23:51,207 --> 00:23:52,276
Load,

288
00:23:52,487 --> 00:23:53,681
unload.

289
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:02,039
It's trustworthy. Hard.
It can penetrate up to...

290
00:24:03,127 --> 00:24:05,595
I don't know
what's in the envelope.

291
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:12,604
A stranger asked me
to give it to my uncle, King Farouk.

292
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:20,359
My little camel...

293
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:24,557
Enough with these animal names.
It gets pretty annoying.

294
00:25:07,727 --> 00:25:10,321
- How is your room?
- Fine, thank you.

295
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,956
Actually it's a bit of a mess.

296
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:15,840
A mouse on the bed
and a roach underneath.

297
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,480
I'll take care of it.

298
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:22,364
He's leaving the hotel.

299
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:26,201
- <i>Salaam Aleikum,</i> Lucien.
- Good evening, Larmina.

300
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:30,480
You get prettier by the hour.
I can't wait till tomorrow!

301
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:34,396
<i>- Inch Allah</i>. Shall I drive?
- I can't refuse a dark-eyed brunette.

302
00:25:34,727 --> 00:25:35,921
And blue-eyed blondes?

303
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:38,358
In any case
you're my kind of woman.

304
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:41,240
What if I were a midget with glasses?

305
00:25:43,927 --> 00:25:45,599
I wouldn't let you drive.

306
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:47,677
Preposterous.

307
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:05,481
Go on, Larmina.
I'll meet you inside.

308
00:26:10,287 --> 00:26:13,836
Now I've got it.
How's the beef stroganoff?

309
00:26:15,687 --> 00:26:17,439
- Didn't you get enough?
- Stop it.

310
00:26:17,647 --> 00:26:19,365
You, stop it!

311
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:32,204
I'm sorry. Come on,
let's have some fun.

312
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:34,159
He's at the Embassy.

313
00:26:49,447 --> 00:26:50,641
A Suze.

314
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:54,363
Nothing to drink?
Lillet? Dubonnet? Cinzano? Brandy?

315
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:56,285
I don't drink alcohol.

316
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,436
How strange!

317
00:26:58,647 --> 00:27:00,319
It's against my religion.

318
00:27:01,047 --> 00:27:03,925
What stupid religion
would forbid alcohol?

319
00:27:04,127 --> 00:27:08,484
The Muslim religion,
practiced by 90% of our population.

320
00:27:09,447 --> 00:27:10,641
I didn't know.

321
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:12,561
Too bad for me.

322
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:18,360
You're very...

323
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:22,684
Very French, in fact.

324
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:25,082
Thank you.

325
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,806
A mambo!

326
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:42,682
Come on!

327
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:45,316
I don't know it.

328
00:27:45,527 --> 00:27:47,677
Watch my feet and do the same.

329
00:27:59,087 --> 00:28:01,965
I guess I'm sort of like...
your mirror.

330
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:05,716
What I see in it tickles me pink.
I'm gorgeous tonight.

331
00:28:05,927 --> 00:28:09,124
That dress hugs my shapes
with just a hint of modesty.

332
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:10,919
Keep quiet and concentrate.

333
00:28:17,647 --> 00:28:19,080
We're not very discreet.

334
00:28:19,287 --> 00:28:21,676
Why be discreet
with a woman like you?

335
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:30,720
Come back. I feel...

336
00:28:31,847 --> 00:28:33,803
Naked without me? I understand.

337
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,480
You see those men?

338
00:28:42,407 --> 00:28:43,476
Interesting clique.

339
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:46,639
You should question them.
I'll introduce you.

340
00:29:17,207 --> 00:29:20,199
Come plunge
into the muddy waters of the Nile.

341
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:25,079
This is Mr. Jefferson's new partner,
Lucien Bramard.

342
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:27,437
You've already met Gerhard Moeller.

343
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:29,603
Pleasure to see you again.

344
00:29:29,807 --> 00:29:31,399
The pleasure's mine.

345
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:35,680
Mr. Pelletier, Society of Belgian
and Egyptian Poultry Producers.

346
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:37,684
Our competitor and friend.

347
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:40,918
- Raymond Pelletier.
- Pleasure.

348
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:44,119
And Yevevni Setine.
He raises sheep.

349
00:29:44,327 --> 00:29:45,123
Pleasure.

350
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:47,557
Mr. Bramard... a cigarette?

351
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:49,439
Thanks. I'm trying to start.

352
00:29:49,647 --> 00:29:51,558
- Miss?
- Thank you.

353
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:03,443
May I?

354
00:30:03,647 --> 00:30:05,000
Be my guest.

355
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:08,804
I would love to show you
the pyramids, Mr. Bramard.

356
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,043
I would love you as a guide.

357
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:16,238
The mystery of the pyramids
is that of unattainable conscience.

358
00:30:16,487 --> 00:30:19,126
Pharaohs were buried
with their servants.

359
00:30:19,327 --> 00:30:22,000
When we die,
we want everything to stop.

360
00:30:22,207 --> 00:30:24,084
It is the cycle of life itself.

361
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:27,836
When someone or something dies,

362
00:30:29,447 --> 00:30:31,278
something or someone is born.

363
00:30:32,487 --> 00:30:34,717
We try to forget we're animals,

364
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:38,283
but nature keeps reminding us.
Sometimes cruelly.

365
00:30:50,047 --> 00:30:54,006
Scientists experiment on fruit flies

366
00:30:54,447 --> 00:30:57,439
because their brains
are very similar to ours.

367
00:30:57,727 --> 00:31:00,560
Through a horse's eye
we seem bigger than we are.

368
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:03,156
That's why we're able to tame them.

369
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:07,326
Our eyes teach us

370
00:31:07,527 --> 00:31:10,280
how to react to others.

371
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:12,404
But we can be near-sighted.

372
00:31:17,847 --> 00:31:20,486
The blind man doesn't see.
He feels.

373
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:22,525
And paradoxically,
he sees.

374
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:24,718
When a cat's tail is straight,

375
00:31:25,847 --> 00:31:27,200
it feels at ease.

376
00:31:27,407 --> 00:31:29,443
An amputee's leg still itches.

377
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:32,366
When women change men,
they change hairstyles.

378
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:35,081
You must let a baby cry at night,

379
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:38,197
or bedtime becomes too ritualized.

380
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:54,525
You want a drink?
We can go to the bar.

381
00:31:57,287 --> 00:31:58,640
A little nightcap?

382
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:03,920
Mr. Bramard?

383
00:32:10,047 --> 00:32:11,958
<i>How is the veal stew?</i>

384
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:29,196
Nigel Gardenborough.
Head of the British Lamb Consortium.

385
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:31,557
Lucien Bramard.
What does this mean?

386
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:33,120
I know who you are.

387
00:32:34,847 --> 00:32:36,280
I tried contacting you.

388
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:39,285
But you get a little hot
under the collar.

389
00:32:39,927 --> 00:32:42,202
Excuse me.
One must be careful.

390
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:45,319
This city is a nest of spies.
What do you want?

391
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:47,877
To warn you of a great danger.

392
00:32:48,607 --> 00:32:49,835
Jefferson...

393
00:32:53,327 --> 00:32:55,238
What's this about, old chap?

394
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:57,717
My God!

395
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:26,159
<i>Choukrane</i>...
The Metropolitan Hotel, please?

396
00:34:45,447 --> 00:34:46,721
<i>Choukrane</i>...

397
00:35:09,967 --> 00:35:11,719
Larmina...

398
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:12,518
It's me.

399
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:14,038
Is it you?

400
00:35:15,007 --> 00:35:16,406
Yes, it's me.

401
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:18,484
I was scared to death.

402
00:35:18,767 --> 00:35:20,359
I preferred to wait here.

403
00:35:21,127 --> 00:35:22,480
Sleep. It'll be fine.

404
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:33,844
Shut your damned mouth!

405
00:36:48,727 --> 00:36:51,366
This ruckus is really getting
on my nerves.

406
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:52,966
I'll show them!

407
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:55,879
<i>Excuse me!</i>

408
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:58,480
<i>Excuse me!</i>

409
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:03,359
<i>Enough with the mike!</i>
<i>Don't act like a baby!</i>

410
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:06,959
<i>Give me that mike!</i>

411
00:37:18,287 --> 00:37:20,847
- Sleep well?
- Very well, thank you.

412
00:37:21,527 --> 00:37:23,119
I had a marvelous dream.

413
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:25,801
Breakfast in bed
with a dark-eyed beauty.

414
00:37:26,447 --> 00:37:27,402
Smooth talker!

415
00:37:27,607 --> 00:37:30,644
Only during breakfast
with dark-eyed beauties.

416
00:37:36,247 --> 00:37:37,521
<i>Bismi Allah</i>...

417
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,485
I love to butter my biscuit.

418
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,122
By the way,

419
00:37:50,327 --> 00:37:53,000
I was woken by a guy
screaming on a tower.

420
00:37:53,207 --> 00:37:55,721
I couldn't sleep.
I had to shut him up.

421
00:37:55,927 --> 00:37:58,122
A muezzin?
You shut up a muezzin?

422
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:00,159
- The...?
- Muezzin.

423
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:02,244
He was calling for prayer.

424
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:03,557
I didn't know.

425
00:38:04,207 --> 00:38:07,677
That's what the ruckus was.
The screaming, the mike...

426
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,396
Yours is a very strange religion.

427
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:14,199
You'll grow tired of it.

428
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:17,245
I bet it won't last long.

429
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:20,802
Larmina, honey,

430
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:24,405
can you drop me at the office?
I'll poke around.

431
00:38:26,047 --> 00:38:27,275
Of course, Lucien.

432
00:38:27,927 --> 00:38:29,155
<i>La choukrane</i>.

433
00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:39,559
See you later...

434
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:12,038
Paper clips...

435
00:39:23,767 --> 00:39:26,156
<i>Poultry and Eggs</i>

436
00:40:00,927 --> 00:40:02,645
You don't need me anymore?

437
00:40:02,887 --> 00:40:04,923
- It's five o'clock.
- Already?

438
00:40:06,207 --> 00:40:09,563
Time really flies!
You can go home, my good man.

439
00:40:11,007 --> 00:40:12,042
Goodnight, faithful Slimane.

440
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:17,323
Kiss your family for me, okay?

441
00:40:17,607 --> 00:40:19,643
How many children? Eight? Nine?

442
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:20,757
Two, sir.

443
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:23,876
Kiss them anyway.

444
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:29,796
Thank you, sir. Goodbye, sir.

445
00:40:43,927 --> 00:40:44,996
Slimane?

446
00:40:46,447 --> 00:40:47,766
Is that you?

447
00:41:24,807 --> 00:41:26,445
My God...

448
00:41:59,887 --> 00:42:02,276
- Are you okay?
- Fine!

449
00:42:06,127 --> 00:42:07,560
You said it would sting.

450
00:42:07,767 --> 00:42:09,200
It usually does.

451
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:12,641
May I?

452
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:14,885
Let's not waste any more time.

453
00:42:17,207 --> 00:42:18,925
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

454
00:42:22,127 --> 00:42:23,242
What an asshole!

455
00:42:27,607 --> 00:42:30,758
It's just scratches.
You could have been infected.

456
00:42:34,647 --> 00:42:36,080
This doesn't bode well.

457
00:42:37,647 --> 00:42:39,365
Business is bad enough.

458
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:41,644
Now we've lost 25 chickens.

459
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:44,837
This was in your assailant's pocket.

460
00:42:45,047 --> 00:42:47,117
Heavens! "Fondouk". What is it?

461
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:48,999
- It's a café.
- Nothing special?

462
00:42:49,607 --> 00:42:51,120
Just your typical café.

463
00:42:52,327 --> 00:42:53,555
What a shame.

464
00:42:54,167 --> 00:42:55,680
We almost had a clue.

465
00:42:58,047 --> 00:43:01,244
Maybe it's worth going there.
You never know.

466
00:43:01,647 --> 00:43:03,205
To find a clue or a lead.

467
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:07,562
You're right.
I couldn't agree more.

468
00:43:08,207 --> 00:43:11,040
Teach me a little Arabic,
so I'll blend in.

469
00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:12,515
From the beginning:

470
00:43:17,247 --> 00:43:17,963
Excellent!

471
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:19,680
- What does it mean?
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

472
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:25,240
It's totally useless.

473
00:43:28,247 --> 00:43:29,965
Unless I need to count to five.

474
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:32,158
Then it might come in handy.

475
00:43:34,287 --> 00:43:37,962
But I can't go past five
because at "six" I get stuck.

476
00:43:40,487 --> 00:43:43,285
Let's try.
Strike while the iron is hot.

477
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,717
Yes. Strike while the iron is hot.

00:45:27,447 --> 00:45:29,836
<i>they have angered</i>
<i>the Eagles of Keops</i>.

494
00:45:44,687 --> 00:45:46,279
<i>The infidel is among us</i>.

495
00:45:46,487 --> 00:45:48,125
<i>Brothers</i>...

496
00:45:48,327 --> 00:45:49,760
<i>The atheist infidel</i>

497
00:45:49,967 --> 00:45:51,195
<i>who stopped the muezzin</i>

498
00:45:51,407 --> 00:45:53,398
<i>from performing his duty</i>
<i>is here</i>.

499
00:45:53,607 --> 00:45:54,676
<i>It is him!</i>

500
00:46:08,647 --> 00:46:10,160
My head...

501
00:46:14,447 --> 00:46:15,800
My wrists...

502
00:46:19,887 --> 00:46:21,286
Why are you here, mutt?

503
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:24,957
I hate touristy places.
Your café seemed authentic.

504
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:28,682
My whip will make you
less of a wise-ass, unbeliever.

505
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:32,004
Untie me and kiss my wise ass, believer.

506
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,436
Six.

507
00:47:08,087 --> 00:47:09,202
Larmina?

508
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,444
Exposed as the rat you are.

509
00:47:12,407 --> 00:47:13,886
How could you betray me?

510
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:15,686
Why did I trust you?

511
00:47:15,887 --> 00:47:17,764
Women are never to be trusted!

512
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:22,406
To think I almost let you
make love to me! What a fine mess!

513
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:24,040
Make love to you?

514
00:47:24,447 --> 00:47:26,085
You silenced a muezzin

515
00:47:26,287 --> 00:47:27,800
just so you could sleep!

516
00:47:28,047 --> 00:47:30,561
I'd rather screw a pig
on a holy Friday!

517
00:47:32,287 --> 00:47:35,563
You judge my country and religion
with condescension.

518
00:47:35,847 --> 00:47:37,200
I can't believe it.

519
00:47:37,687 --> 00:47:41,521
Your cigarettes, your mambo, your tits
mixed up with fanatics!

520
00:47:41,807 --> 00:47:43,684
I told you.
You didn't listen.

521
00:47:44,087 --> 00:47:45,884
My father was a great man.

522
00:47:46,847 --> 00:47:51,045
If he hadn't played paddle ball,
he'd have led the revolution!

523
00:47:51,247 --> 00:47:53,477
- You're not like those men.
- I am.

524
00:47:53,687 --> 00:47:55,598
I fight to be respected.

525
00:47:55,887 --> 00:47:57,639
Too bad they're not like you.

526
00:47:57,927 --> 00:48:02,000
If their bodies were as shapely
as yours, I'd switch teams.

527
00:48:02,207 --> 00:48:04,596
Don't you ever talk
about my body!

528
00:48:06,287 --> 00:48:08,357
If they had such round breasts,

529
00:48:09,647 --> 00:48:11,444
such captivating cleavage,

530
00:48:11,727 --> 00:48:15,163
nipples that perked up
at the slightest emotion or breeze

531
00:48:15,487 --> 00:48:17,682
nipples that you want to nibble...

532
00:48:18,087 --> 00:48:20,999
so pink, so healthy,
swelling with life...

533
00:48:21,767 --> 00:48:22,722
You're a fool.

534
00:48:22,927 --> 00:48:24,804
Yes... but I'm free!

535
00:48:28,887 --> 00:48:31,003
Okay... I'm going.

536
00:48:31,207 --> 00:48:32,435
What about you?

537
00:48:32,927 --> 00:48:36,363
Just kidding.
So long, Larmina... <i>Inch Allah</i>.

538
00:48:38,327 --> 00:48:39,680
I'm such a ham!

539
00:48:42,967 --> 00:48:44,366
Oh yes, I'd forgotten.

540
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:46,922
You're leaving
without bidding farewell?

541
00:48:47,127 --> 00:48:49,322
I'll bid you farewell,
one by one.

542
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:52,087
- Go ahead and try.
- Who wants to start?

543
00:48:59,607 --> 00:49:00,801
Go ahead and try...

544
00:49:02,047 --> 00:49:03,241
Who wants to start?

545
00:49:05,407 --> 00:49:08,604
So infidel, you're leaving
without bidding farewell?

546
00:49:09,407 --> 00:49:11,523
One bids farewell
only in polite society.

547
00:51:42,927 --> 00:51:44,201
Good evening.

548
00:51:45,247 --> 00:51:46,885
No messages?

549
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:52,444
Fine...

550
00:51:53,047 --> 00:51:54,639
I'll be in my room.

551
00:52:06,047 --> 00:52:07,605
He's at the hotel.

552
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,275
<i>Okay. You can stop following him now</i>.

553
00:52:10,847 --> 00:52:13,805
<i>Kill the Frenchman</i>.
<i>He's getting very nosy</i>.

554
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:15,281
<i>Jackass</i>.

555
00:52:15,847 --> 00:52:18,077
<i>He raped me twice</i>.
<i>Maybe even more</i>.

556
00:52:20,967 --> 00:52:21,717
<i>He's in his room</i>.

557
00:52:21,927 --> 00:52:23,838
<i>Stop following him, I said!</i>

558
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,800
<i>And he has a pistol</i>.

559
00:52:27,207 --> 00:52:28,242
<i>It can penetrate</i>...

560
00:52:28,447 --> 00:52:31,359
<i>He's just a small spy</i>
<i>with a big ego</i>.

561
00:52:31,567 --> 00:52:32,795
<i>He's not dangerous?</i>

562
00:52:33,047 --> 00:52:34,480
<i>Not at all</i>.

563
00:52:38,127 --> 00:52:41,244
French Embassy

564
00:53:02,047 --> 00:53:03,116
Hubert, old chap.

565
00:53:03,327 --> 00:53:05,079
Plantieux, good to see you!

566
00:53:06,087 --> 00:53:07,964
- How long has it been?
- Too long!

567
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,886
Like I say: "When it's long,
it's too long!"

568
00:53:19,047 --> 00:53:20,639
- On the rocks?
- The usual!

569
00:53:29,807 --> 00:53:31,035
Funny...

570
00:53:32,567 --> 00:53:34,239
To our colonial empire!

571
00:53:41,447 --> 00:53:42,800
The unrest here...

572
00:53:43,007 --> 00:53:46,841
in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia,
the fall of Dien Bien Phu...

573
00:53:47,087 --> 00:53:50,124
But trust me. We'll persevere
and keep our colonies!

574
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:51,755
<i>Inch Allah</i>, Plantieux.

575
00:53:52,607 --> 00:53:54,359
- How's it going?
- It's not.

576
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:57,957
I searched the S.C.E.P.
All I found are chicken receipts.

577
00:53:58,687 --> 00:53:59,915
What do you think?

578
00:54:01,087 --> 00:54:03,123
The books are far from great,

579
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:04,806
but there's potential.

580
00:54:05,727 --> 00:54:07,797
Two years ago, our largest competitor

581
00:54:08,007 --> 00:54:11,283
had 85% of the market.
Now we're number one.

582
00:54:16,327 --> 00:54:17,646
In fact...

583
00:54:18,207 --> 00:54:21,165
I wanted your take
on the Jefferson case...

584
00:54:22,407 --> 00:54:24,204
Jack... Of course...

585
00:54:24,687 --> 00:54:26,484
I still don't know who did it.

586
00:54:27,247 --> 00:54:28,919
But if ever I found out...

587
00:54:31,607 --> 00:54:32,642
Thank you.

588
00:54:33,527 --> 00:54:34,277
What's this?

589
00:54:34,727 --> 00:54:37,321
Jack's writing.
"Kapov" is the Russian ship

590
00:54:37,527 --> 00:54:40,599
that's missing. This is important.
Here's your clue!

591
00:54:42,127 --> 00:54:44,357
These matchbooks keep popping up.

592
00:54:44,687 --> 00:54:48,202
The chicken-chucker left this.
It led me straight to...

593
00:54:49,727 --> 00:54:51,046
to the...

594
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:53,205
- The Eagles of...
- Keops?

595
00:54:55,287 --> 00:54:57,562
Another clue! Good job!
Hat's off!

596
00:54:57,767 --> 00:55:00,884
I was in a crowd clamoring
for revolution and arms.

597
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:03,078
The Eagles are getting arms?

598
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:08,840
Worrisome. Warn the Egyptian government.
I'll tell Paris.

599
00:55:09,847 --> 00:55:11,041
Well done, old chap.

600
00:55:11,247 --> 00:55:14,319
Intuition, discretion, deduction...
Pure OSS 117!

601
00:55:14,527 --> 00:55:17,678
A question of brainpower
and concentration.

602
00:55:17,887 --> 00:55:21,675
Talk to that Russian, Setine.
He's always at the steam bath.

603
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:23,676
Okay.

604
00:55:25,727 --> 00:55:26,842
Paris. Code red.

605
00:55:31,647 --> 00:55:32,841
I'm off.

606
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:36,761
What should I do,
before the steam bath?

607
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,683
The government.

608
00:55:40,367 --> 00:55:41,117
Of Egypt.

609
00:55:43,247 --> 00:55:44,646
That's right.

610
00:55:46,007 --> 00:55:47,326
Well, I'm off.

611
00:55:49,527 --> 00:55:50,926
So long, Plantieux.

612
00:55:53,687 --> 00:55:55,006
Code red.

613
00:56:15,607 --> 00:56:18,440
Thank you for warning us,
Mr. Bonisseur de la Bath.

614
00:56:18,647 --> 00:56:19,966
We'll take immediate action.

615
00:56:20,167 --> 00:56:21,316
It's perfectly normal.

616
00:56:21,527 --> 00:56:24,678
The Eagles want us
to return to the Middle Ages.

617
00:56:25,487 --> 00:56:29,844
That unconscionable attack
on the muezzin sent them over the edge.

618
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:31,836
Did it?

619
00:56:34,007 --> 00:56:35,645
This fountain is pretty.

620
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:41,042
I love the white noise water makes.

621
00:56:46,687 --> 00:56:49,884
The first puff is for you,
Mr. Bonisseur de la Bath.

622
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:55,325
It's soothing, and leads
to pleasant, intelligent conversation.

623
00:56:55,527 --> 00:56:57,518
An ancient Oriental tradition.

624
00:56:57,727 --> 00:56:59,718
Then I'd love to start smoking again.

625
00:57:03,807 --> 00:57:06,116
How flattering to see
a man like you

626
00:57:06,407 --> 00:57:08,477
speak our language so fluently.

627
00:57:08,847 --> 00:57:12,886
I won't be sharing the hookah
with a guest, but a friend.

628
00:57:13,807 --> 00:57:15,399
Our country's development

629
00:57:15,607 --> 00:57:19,680
and modernization have made
some people jealous and bitter.

630
00:57:19,927 --> 00:57:23,476
Notjust the Eagles,
but our degenerate royal family.

631
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:27,760
They won't accept that we removed
crooked Farouk from power.

632
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,717
They may be a family of degenerates

633
00:57:32,087 --> 00:57:34,601
but Princess Al Tarouk
is worth the trip!

634
00:57:34,847 --> 00:57:36,917
That royal blood sure can boil!

635
00:57:37,127 --> 00:57:40,403
The way she squeals!
A real fishmonger's wife!

636
00:57:57,007 --> 00:58:02,764
Getting back to Egypt...
Development, modernization okay, but...

637
00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:04,685
Thank God for the West.

638
00:58:04,887 --> 00:58:05,603
Pardon me?

639
00:58:05,807 --> 00:58:07,843
Look at the canal. Pardon you!

640
00:58:08,127 --> 00:58:09,958
Good thing it's European-run!

641
00:58:10,247 --> 00:58:11,965
Not like your city streets!

642
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:13,919
I'm telling you as a friend.

643
00:58:14,647 --> 00:58:16,399
It's 1955. Come on, wake up!

644
00:58:17,007 --> 00:58:20,556
Donkeys and <i>jellabas</i>
and writing you can't read...

645
00:58:26,527 --> 00:58:28,040
It's time to grow up!

646
00:58:29,407 --> 00:58:30,965
Time to grow up, man!

647
00:58:33,807 --> 00:58:38,119
I'm in poultry.
In terms of chicken alone, it's a mess!

648
00:58:39,567 --> 00:58:40,761
Never the right papers.

649
00:58:47,327 --> 00:58:50,637
If we weren't allies,
you'd be rotting in jail!

650
00:58:50,967 --> 00:58:52,161
What did I say?

651
00:58:55,927 --> 00:58:57,155
Fat ass.

652
00:58:58,327 --> 00:59:01,000
<i>Suleyman Pacha</i>
<i>Steam Bath</i>

653
00:59:01,647 --> 00:59:05,162
It's a good thing
you came to see me, Mr. Bramard.

654
00:59:05,367 --> 00:59:07,323
Your skin is terribly dry.

655
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:09,122
Really?

656
00:59:09,927 --> 00:59:11,360
You should moisturize.

657
00:59:11,607 --> 00:59:14,075
A moisturizer
with high penetrability.

658
00:59:15,447 --> 00:59:16,436
It's heaven.

659
00:59:20,327 --> 00:59:22,158
I love being rubbed with oil.

660
00:59:24,367 --> 00:59:26,358
Did you have something to tell me?

661
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:28,603
Yes. Does "Kapov" sound familiar?

662
00:59:32,967 --> 00:59:36,755
Sounds like my country's ship
that disappeared last month.

663
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:40,405
Allow me to confide you
to expert hands.

664
00:59:40,607 --> 00:59:42,962
The best of the Suleyman Pacha Bath.

665
00:59:43,407 --> 00:59:45,238
And the best of the Orient,

666
00:59:45,807 --> 00:59:47,035
Khalid.

667
00:59:47,567 --> 00:59:50,286
He's the tall one.
The other is Loktar.

668
00:59:50,527 --> 00:59:54,406
Khalid mixes two traditional
massage methods: The shiatsu

669
00:59:54,607 --> 00:59:57,246
for the nerve centers
and the Nuan Thai

670
00:59:57,447 --> 00:59:58,846
for stretching.

671
01:00:00,687 --> 01:00:01,836
It's staggering!

672
01:00:02,047 --> 01:00:04,845
Khalid is a master.
A <i>maalem</i>, as they say.

673
01:00:05,807 --> 01:00:07,126
Invigorating.

674
01:00:07,327 --> 01:00:10,922
Would you like the session to last
or will you talk?

675
01:00:11,127 --> 01:00:12,196
Talk about what?

676
01:00:12,407 --> 01:00:14,045
Your partner, Jefferson.

677
01:00:14,287 --> 01:00:16,357
- Jack's out of town.
- Nice try!

678
01:00:16,567 --> 01:00:19,400
You're as much in poultry
as I am in lamb.

679
01:00:19,607 --> 01:00:22,246
The Kapov. Soviet ship.
Disappears one day

680
01:00:22,447 --> 01:00:24,722
with a cargo of arms.
The day after,

681
01:00:24,927 --> 01:00:27,487
Jefferson disappears.
Odd, isn't it?

682
01:00:27,687 --> 01:00:31,236
My sole purpose here
is to increase my chicken sales.

683
01:00:31,847 --> 01:00:33,200
Lymphatic drainage!

684
01:00:33,807 --> 01:00:35,923
At the Embassy you had a matchbook

685
01:00:36,127 --> 01:00:38,436
with "Kapov" written in it. Odd, no?

686
01:00:38,647 --> 01:00:41,559
I want to break into
the Jordanian and Syrian markets.

687
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:45,442
Enough, Bramard!
Or should I call you OSS 117?

688
01:00:45,647 --> 01:00:47,638
Where's the Kapov?
Where are the arms?

689
01:00:47,847 --> 01:00:50,156
And where's Jefferson?
Three questions.

690
01:00:52,807 --> 01:00:54,001
One answer.

691
01:00:54,687 --> 01:00:55,676
Two answers.

692
01:01:01,007 --> 01:01:01,757
And three answers.

693
01:01:04,047 --> 01:01:07,005
Truth is,
they came "Russian" at me.

694
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:33,160
Hello, Moeller.

695
01:01:33,367 --> 01:01:34,720
Get in, Herr Bramard.

696
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:41,846
How's our friend Setine?

697
01:01:42,047 --> 01:01:43,560
Just fair, alas.

698
01:01:45,247 --> 01:01:46,646
What do you want, Moeller?

699
01:01:47,367 --> 01:01:51,042
That trip to the pyramids...
Still up for it?

700
01:01:51,247 --> 01:01:52,600
It'll be a pleasure.

701
01:01:52,807 --> 01:01:54,525
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

702
01:01:54,727 --> 01:01:55,796
Good.

703
01:01:58,447 --> 01:02:00,597
Shall I drop you at your hotel?

704
01:02:00,807 --> 01:02:04,720
I'd prefer the S.C.E.P.
I have some work to do.

705
01:02:30,127 --> 01:02:31,879
He just left the hotel.

706
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,326
Herr Bramard,

707
01:02:41,247 --> 01:02:42,919
how paltry is our poultry

708
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:46,119
before these masterpieces
of ancient history?

709
01:02:47,767 --> 01:02:50,998
I haven't the slightest idea...
Very?

710
01:02:53,127 --> 01:02:55,436
What happened to Setine is awful.

711
01:02:55,847 --> 01:02:57,678
I've heard such wild rumors.

712
01:02:58,847 --> 01:03:01,998
It would seem that
his morals were ambiguous.

713
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,206
Especially in the bathhouse
where you met.

714
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:06,482
Did you know?

715
01:03:07,407 --> 01:03:08,681
I had no idea.

716
01:03:08,887 --> 01:03:12,721
How strange.
Rumor has it that you and he...

717
01:03:12,927 --> 01:03:14,360
Well I had no idea!

718
01:03:14,567 --> 01:03:16,046
Let's keep it that way.

719
01:03:16,967 --> 01:03:18,286
Men belong with women.

720
01:03:18,487 --> 01:03:21,559
The rest is perversion
and mental illness.

721
01:03:22,327 --> 01:03:24,124
I couldn't agree more.

722
01:03:28,487 --> 01:03:31,399
<i>Entrance to Pyramids</i>

723
01:03:31,647 --> 01:03:35,162
Herr Bramard... you'll see,
it's quite amazing.

724
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:37,282
Come here.

725
01:03:41,647 --> 01:03:43,558
This sudden intimacy is fitting.

726
01:03:43,767 --> 01:03:45,359
I have some questions for you.

727
01:03:45,567 --> 01:03:47,637
Where's the Kapov? Where's Jefferson?

728
01:03:47,847 --> 01:03:51,635
You disappoint me.
I thought you came for the pyramids.

729
01:03:51,847 --> 01:03:53,724
I didn't. I couldn't care less.

730
01:03:54,087 --> 01:03:58,046
You're wrong. It's inside
that their splendor is apparent.

731
01:03:58,247 --> 01:03:59,396
Where are we going?

732
01:03:59,607 --> 01:04:01,723
Don't worry, Herr Bramard.

733
01:04:08,967 --> 01:04:10,446
Good heavens!

734
01:04:15,607 --> 01:04:17,802
What is this three-ring circus?

735
01:04:19,207 --> 01:04:21,675
Colonel Moeller,
of the German Wehrmacht.

736
01:04:21,967 --> 01:04:24,401
Good to have you among us, OSS 117.

737
01:04:26,887 --> 01:04:28,559
I've waited ages for this.

738
01:04:28,887 --> 01:04:30,320
Ten years, in fact.

739
01:04:30,527 --> 01:04:34,076
Ever since you killed my friend,
Colonel von Umsprung.

740
01:04:34,367 --> 01:04:35,720
- Von...?
- Umpsprung.

741
01:04:35,927 --> 01:04:38,236
Colonel Hermann von Umsprung,
Waffen SS.

742
01:04:38,447 --> 01:04:41,359
- I can't remember.
- Think. Tall with dark hair.

743
01:04:41,567 --> 01:04:44,718
I've killed so many Nazis,
I've lost track.

744
01:04:45,207 --> 01:04:47,118
But each time was a pleasure.

745
01:04:47,647 --> 01:04:48,875
Hermann...

746
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:58,842
Catch!

747
01:05:02,007 --> 01:05:04,316
That's what you call hitting...

748
01:05:04,527 --> 01:05:05,403
hard?

749
01:05:07,567 --> 01:05:08,761
Hermann...

750
01:05:09,767 --> 01:05:12,998
he occupies my thoughts
since he fell from that plane.

751
01:05:13,287 --> 01:05:14,800
Oh, him!

752
01:05:16,327 --> 01:05:18,443
- The V2 blueprints.
- Exactly.

753
01:05:18,647 --> 01:05:21,525
Okay, okay, now I see,
now I see, yes, yes.

754
01:05:21,727 --> 01:05:23,524
The blueprints for the Americans.

755
01:05:23,727 --> 01:05:24,796
Exactly!

756
01:05:25,007 --> 01:05:26,042
Tall guy, dark hair.

757
01:05:26,247 --> 01:05:27,805
- Exactly!
- Sweet guy.

758
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:30,726
That's right.
Hermann von Umpsrung, my friend.

759
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,883
Yes, yes, Hermann. Nice mission.

760
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,200
Nice mission.

761
01:05:36,847 --> 01:05:38,997
My God, so you killed Jefferson!

762
01:05:39,207 --> 01:05:42,040
Unfortunately, not.
Someone got there first.

763
01:05:42,247 --> 01:05:44,522
But I'll make up for it with you.

764
01:05:45,447 --> 01:05:47,517
- Tie him up.
- Shut up, Loktar!

765
01:05:47,727 --> 01:05:49,319
- You?
- You've met, right?

766
01:05:49,527 --> 01:05:51,518
What's up, 117!

767
01:05:51,727 --> 01:05:56,198
Notjust a coward, but a traitor,
as your size leads one to expect.

768
01:05:56,407 --> 01:05:59,604
Who the hell are you?
Who are you? <i>Nardim amouk</i>.

769
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,081
Quiet, Loktar!

770
01:06:01,527 --> 01:06:03,882
- Where is the Kapov?
- I won't say.

771
01:06:04,087 --> 01:06:07,523
Nazis and their ideology
have always left me... nonplussed.

772
01:06:10,447 --> 01:06:13,007
Funny how Nazis
are always the bad guys.

773
01:06:13,687 --> 01:06:16,360
This is 1955, Herr Bramard.

774
01:06:16,567 --> 01:06:18,922
Don't we deserve a second chance?

775
01:06:19,127 --> 01:06:19,843
Thanks.

776
01:06:20,047 --> 01:06:21,082
Tie him up.

777
01:06:21,287 --> 01:06:24,165
Enough, Loktar! Shut up
or I'll shut you up.

778
01:06:25,767 --> 01:06:28,156
You're tolerated here!
Barely tolerated!

779
01:06:28,647 --> 01:06:31,036
I'm a little embarrassed, because...

780
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:34,604
I can't say "Speak or I'll kill you"

781
01:06:34,807 --> 01:06:37,958
because I'll be killing you anyway.
For Hermann...

782
01:06:38,967 --> 01:06:41,356
But... this will perhaps

783
01:06:41,567 --> 01:06:43,319
make you want to help me.

784
01:06:52,407 --> 01:06:53,726
So Herr Bramard,

785
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:55,246
what will it be?

786
01:06:55,527 --> 01:06:58,246
The arms... or your secretary?

787
01:06:59,087 --> 01:07:00,839
She's no longer under my employ.

788
01:07:03,567 --> 01:07:04,920
How does she look?

789
01:07:08,567 --> 01:07:10,683
Shall I undress her before my men?

790
01:07:10,887 --> 01:07:13,082
Do as you please.
She leaves me ice-cold.

791
01:07:15,407 --> 01:07:16,965
How silly of me.

792
01:07:20,207 --> 01:07:23,040
It would have been easier
with Herr Setine

793
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:26,956
instead. With his wonderful
weenie-wandering hands!

794
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:28,885
Weenie? What weenie?

795
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,725
"I love being rubbed with oil."

796
01:07:30,927 --> 01:07:32,440
- I never said that!
- I saw!

797
01:07:32,647 --> 01:07:34,205
You're talking nonsense!

798
01:07:38,407 --> 01:07:40,045
Total nonsense!

799
01:07:46,327 --> 01:07:48,795
Let me show you something,
Herr Bramard.

800
01:07:54,087 --> 01:07:56,442
You see these screens?
A surveillance system,

801
01:07:56,647 --> 01:07:58,877
incredibly hi-tech.

802
01:07:59,287 --> 01:08:00,766
It's just amazing.

803
01:08:01,527 --> 01:08:05,236
Machines that allow you
to record on magnetic tapes.

804
01:08:08,087 --> 01:08:11,443
VTMs: Video Tape Machines.

805
01:08:14,367 --> 01:08:15,482
Loktar...

806
01:08:19,407 --> 01:08:21,523
Once the screens warm up...

807
01:08:22,527 --> 01:08:24,404
- Adieu, Moeller.
- What the hell?

808
01:08:29,007 --> 01:08:30,884
I said "Tie him up!"

809
01:08:31,687 --> 01:08:33,166
And I said "Shut up!"

810
01:08:35,807 --> 01:08:36,842
How did you do that?

811
01:08:37,047 --> 01:08:40,517
When a culture grabs your interest,
you learn the language.

812
01:08:43,407 --> 01:08:45,477
In this case,
it was hieroglyphics.

813
01:08:47,247 --> 01:08:48,965
How do we get out of here?

814
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:51,158
We'll never get out of here!

815
01:08:51,807 --> 01:08:54,162
No one ever got out of here.

816
01:08:55,527 --> 01:08:58,121
The Kephren Pyramid will be out tomb!

817
01:08:58,327 --> 01:09:01,000
In 150 years
they'll find our skeletons.

818
01:09:01,207 --> 01:09:03,118
Walled in for life! For life!

819
01:09:03,327 --> 01:09:06,364
We'll have to eat our feet
and clothes...

820
01:09:06,567 --> 01:09:07,795
We're going to die!

821
01:09:08,527 --> 01:09:09,277
Are you coming?

822
01:09:19,767 --> 01:09:21,678
Thank you, you saved my life.

823
01:09:21,887 --> 01:09:23,320
No, I didn't.

824
01:09:23,567 --> 01:09:26,843
I hated that fascist's insinuations
about my sexuality.

825
01:09:27,647 --> 01:09:29,444
How are the Eagles of Keops?

826
01:09:29,647 --> 01:09:31,717
Fine.
Fighting for the right cause.

827
01:09:31,927 --> 01:09:37,126
The cause got me thrown into the canal,
into a skeleton junkyard.

828
01:09:38,327 --> 01:09:39,157
Oh yes...

829
01:09:44,367 --> 01:09:46,961
The paddle ball I found
round your father's neck.

830
01:09:51,007 --> 01:09:52,804
A great man of great importance.

831
01:09:54,007 --> 01:09:56,202
That was no innocent
paddle ball accident.

832
01:09:57,807 --> 01:09:59,479
We have an hour's hump ahead.

833
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:08,042
Don't cry. Figure out
who had the most to gain.

834
01:10:42,527 --> 01:10:45,644
<i>"Stop following him"</i>
<i>means "Stop following him."</i>

835
01:10:47,007 --> 01:10:48,963
<i>Not "Keep on following him."</i>

836
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:53,006
<i>Or else I say</i>
"Keep on following him."

837
01:11:10,407 --> 01:11:12,875
Lucien, I've...
I've thought it over.

838
01:11:14,287 --> 01:11:17,438
Only one man hated my father.
The lmam of the Eagles.

839
01:11:17,647 --> 01:11:20,081
- The I...?
- Mam. The old man at the café.

840
01:11:20,647 --> 01:11:22,365
I'll kill him
with my own two hands.

841
01:11:22,567 --> 01:11:24,842
You can't kill people on a lark.

842
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:27,402
I'm sorry about the other night.

843
01:11:28,607 --> 01:11:29,403
I'm not sorry.

844
01:11:29,927 --> 01:11:32,077
What I saw
made the torture worth it.

845
01:11:32,567 --> 01:11:34,797
The worst torture
was not seeing more.

846
01:11:35,727 --> 01:11:36,716
You embarrass me.

847
01:11:37,087 --> 01:11:38,679
- I'm flattered.
- As am I.

848
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:45,044
The Eagles of Keops
are arming themselves.

849
01:11:45,327 --> 01:11:49,002
And the Kapov disappeared
while transporting arms.

850
01:11:49,207 --> 01:11:50,686
That's a lot of arms.

851
01:11:51,727 --> 01:11:52,955
Probably the same arms.

852
01:11:56,047 --> 01:11:56,797
Possibly.

853
01:11:57,167 --> 01:11:58,600
But something's fishy.

854
01:11:58,927 --> 01:12:02,124
Jack was killed.
In a matchbook he wrote "Kapov."

855
01:12:02,407 --> 01:12:04,557
Maybe he learned it had arms on it.

856
01:12:04,847 --> 01:12:07,759
Possible.
But how does the Princess fit in?

857
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:10,003
Maybe she wants arms too.

858
01:12:12,367 --> 01:12:14,801
Larmina,
let me tell you how I see it.

859
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:17,283
Maybe Jack knew the Kapov had arms.

860
01:12:17,487 --> 01:12:18,761
The Princess may want arms.

861
01:12:19,567 --> 01:12:22,479
The Eagles of Keoops
may want the same arms.

862
01:12:23,647 --> 01:12:24,363
Could be.

863
01:12:24,567 --> 01:12:26,558
Yes, I think it holds water!

864
01:12:29,927 --> 01:12:31,406
Invite the madman here.

865
01:12:31,607 --> 01:12:32,437
The lmam.

866
01:12:32,927 --> 01:12:35,521
Offer him a drink and get him to talk.

867
01:12:35,727 --> 01:12:37,797
He dishonors our religion.

868
01:12:41,287 --> 01:12:43,517
You see those folkloric musicians?

869
01:12:44,607 --> 01:12:45,357
Traditional.

870
01:12:46,047 --> 01:12:47,765
I don't know the Arab word.

871
01:12:48,567 --> 01:12:51,127
What's that guitar
shaped like a crab cake?

872
01:12:51,647 --> 01:12:52,477
An oud.

873
01:12:54,007 --> 01:12:55,486
Now here's the plan.

874
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,875
Excuse me?

875
01:15:46,887 --> 01:15:49,196
Let's get out of here.

876
01:15:49,687 --> 01:15:51,279
What a racket!

877
01:16:16,847 --> 01:16:18,724
<i>I'll be back in an hour</i>.

878
01:16:43,447 --> 01:16:46,200
Thank you, thank you.
<i>La choukrane</i> to all.

879
01:16:47,687 --> 01:16:51,646
He said he's picking up the arms
on Pier 17 at nine.

880
01:16:51,847 --> 01:16:55,283
They're being sold by a white man
in a torn <i>jellaba</i>.

881
01:16:55,487 --> 01:16:56,715
Another <i>jellaba</i>?

882
01:16:56,927 --> 01:17:00,203
Like the chicken-chucker,
the arms dealer and a Brit-killer.

883
01:17:00,447 --> 01:17:02,483
It's probably the same <i>jellaba</i>.

884
01:17:04,727 --> 01:17:06,365
One <i>jellaba</i> for three people?

885
01:17:06,567 --> 01:17:09,639
Your sweet,
but it's probably the same person.

886
01:17:09,847 --> 01:17:10,563
Probably...

887
01:17:10,767 --> 01:17:12,086
Ten to seven.

888
01:17:12,287 --> 01:17:14,437
We must act
before he gets the arms.

889
01:17:14,647 --> 01:17:16,160
- Let me come.
- Impossible.

890
01:17:16,367 --> 01:17:19,279
You've risked enough.
Tell Plantieux at the Embassy:

891
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:23,400
"Chicken chucker, arms dealer,
Brit-killer: One man." Get that?

892
01:17:23,607 --> 01:17:24,926
Got it.

893
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:26,956
You sure?

894
01:17:27,807 --> 01:17:30,560
If not, say so.
No shame in not understanding.

895
01:17:30,767 --> 01:17:31,882
No, I understood.

896
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:37,202
I can write it down.
It'll take a minute.

897
01:17:37,447 --> 01:17:39,802
- I said I understand.
- I'll trust you.

898
01:17:40,007 --> 01:17:42,043
Big problem at the S.C.E.P.!

899
01:17:42,247 --> 01:17:45,444
My God, my chickens!
First the S.C.E.P., then the arms.

900
01:17:54,567 --> 01:17:56,285
Step on it, Slimane!

901
01:18:01,487 --> 01:18:02,317
Faster!

902
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:15,921
Thank you, Slimane...
devoted pillar of the S.C.E.P.

903
01:18:16,127 --> 01:18:17,685
I know, you're my friend.

904
01:18:20,207 --> 01:18:22,482
Here. Buy shoes for your kids.

905
01:18:22,687 --> 01:18:26,077
It'll be tough.
They're at university in New York.

906
01:18:32,927 --> 01:18:34,280
My head...

907
01:18:36,047 --> 01:18:38,402
So Bramard... you're coming to?

908
01:18:39,487 --> 01:18:40,556
You know Slimane...

909
01:18:40,927 --> 01:18:43,919
Slimane? You?
My devoted foreman...

910
01:18:44,127 --> 01:18:46,846
Bramard! A foreman like him
deserves to be

911
01:18:47,047 --> 01:18:48,639
- cherished.
- I cherish him!

912
01:18:48,847 --> 01:18:51,680
With coins and trinkets.
That's not cherishing!

913
01:18:52,567 --> 01:18:54,319
Here! My good luck charm.

914
01:18:57,607 --> 01:19:00,405
President Coty.
How dare you? Crooked pillar!

915
01:19:00,847 --> 01:19:03,520
Get back down!
Don't try acting smart!

916
01:19:03,727 --> 01:19:04,921
Get it?

917
01:19:07,687 --> 01:19:10,963
What do you want?
Where's the Kapov? The arms? Jack?

918
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:14,477
I couldn't care less about that!
I don't care! Understand?

919
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:17,155
Before Jefferson arrived,
I was the king!

920
01:19:17,367 --> 01:19:18,880
The boss! The big boy!

921
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:20,406
Then the S.E.P. Came.

922
01:19:20,607 --> 01:19:22,165
- The S.C.E.P.
- Yeah whatever.

923
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:26,679
The S.E.P. Came and stole my clients.
One by one.

924
01:19:27,087 --> 01:19:28,805
Now all I want

925
01:19:29,447 --> 01:19:33,759
is for you to sign this paper
authorizing the S.E.P.

926
01:19:33,967 --> 01:19:34,683
The S.C.E.P.

927
01:19:35,127 --> 01:19:39,200
The S.E.P. Or the S.C.E.P.
Since Slimane is such a smarty pants!

928
01:19:39,847 --> 01:19:42,122
Sell it to me,
orjust give it to me.

929
01:19:42,327 --> 01:19:44,443
Then you'll be free to go.

930
01:19:44,647 --> 01:19:47,036
Give you the S.C.E.P.?
I'd rather die!

931
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:50,479
You want to end up
like your chickens, Bramard?

932
01:19:50,687 --> 01:19:54,236
Decapitated, gutted, feathered?
Is that what you want?

933
01:19:54,447 --> 01:19:55,800
For my chickens, yes!

934
01:19:56,127 --> 01:19:59,278
I'll shoot you like a bird!
You won't know what hit you!

935
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:01,762
Don't insist.
You'll get nothing. <i>Walou</i>.

936
01:20:03,087 --> 01:20:05,043
You don't impress me, Bramard.

937
01:20:05,407 --> 01:20:06,522
You're a clown.

938
01:20:07,487 --> 01:20:08,920
Poor guy.

939
01:20:11,087 --> 01:20:12,520
So long, Bramard.

940
01:20:13,527 --> 01:20:15,165
You were warned.

941
01:20:19,127 --> 01:20:21,038
What's going on here?

942
01:20:22,847 --> 01:20:26,203
One of the canons...
Something is clogging it.

943
01:20:30,007 --> 01:20:30,803
It's jammed.

944
01:20:31,007 --> 01:20:34,886
Jammed, jammed, I see it's jammed!
Do I look stupid?

945
01:20:37,687 --> 01:20:38,517
You shouldn't...

946
01:20:49,247 --> 01:20:52,444
See Slimane?
That's why his chicken sales declined.

947
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:55,366
Shoddy maintenance
means shoddy quality.

948
01:20:56,407 --> 01:20:59,399
I won't punish you.
You've learned your lesson.

949
01:20:59,687 --> 01:21:00,915
Am I wrong?

950
01:21:03,087 --> 01:21:04,805
Your silence is golden.

951
01:21:13,647 --> 01:21:16,286
<i>He's very stupid</i>... <i>or very smart</i>.

952
01:21:20,967 --> 01:21:22,878
<i>Pier 17</i>

953
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:33,679
Don't move, old madman!

954
01:21:36,727 --> 01:21:38,001
That was a warning.

955
01:21:40,167 --> 01:21:42,283
You? I thought the fish ate you.

956
01:21:42,487 --> 01:21:44,796
They found me inedible.

957
01:21:45,007 --> 01:21:47,202
Too many muscles, too many nerves.

958
01:21:47,407 --> 01:21:48,965
Wretched dog!

959
01:21:49,167 --> 01:21:49,963
Charming greeting.

960
01:21:50,167 --> 01:21:52,397
Hands up, OSS 117.

961
01:21:54,887 --> 01:21:56,400
Drop your gun.

962
01:21:57,687 --> 01:21:58,915
Move forward.

963
01:22:01,567 --> 01:22:03,444
Further... to the lmam.

964
01:22:03,647 --> 01:22:04,716
The I...?

965
01:22:04,927 --> 01:22:06,440
Mam. The lmam.

966
01:22:07,527 --> 01:22:09,722
Oh, him! Now I get it.

967
01:22:14,927 --> 01:22:17,236
- Got the money?
- Yes. Got the arms?

968
01:22:18,407 --> 01:22:19,442
Over there.

969
01:22:21,327 --> 01:22:24,444
Allow me to give him to you
as a bonus.

970
01:22:24,687 --> 01:22:26,200
<i>Choukrane</i>, Mr...

971
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:27,522

Mr...

973
01:22:29,447 --> 01:22:30,562
Jefferson.

974
01:22:34,367 --> 01:22:36,244
- Hello, Hubert.
- You're not dead?

975
01:22:36,447 --> 01:22:37,880
OSS 283 is dead.

976
01:22:38,327 --> 01:22:39,885
- But you're not dead?
- No.

977
01:22:40,087 --> 01:22:44,160
I never figured you were alive.
In fact I thought you were dead.

978
01:22:44,367 --> 01:22:45,561
I was pretending.

979
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:47,480
My God!

980
01:22:50,367 --> 01:22:51,436
So it was you who...

981
01:22:54,047 --> 01:22:55,366
I figured you were dead.

982
01:23:00,047 --> 01:23:02,436
My friend. My brother.

983
01:23:03,487 --> 01:23:04,715
Your friend?

984
01:23:05,527 --> 01:23:07,438
That's not how I remember it.

985
01:23:13,047 --> 01:23:14,321
Twenty-three to zero!

986
01:23:14,527 --> 01:23:16,165
I'm whipping your ass!

987
01:23:16,527 --> 01:23:19,997
You can't play, Jack! You suck!

988
01:23:26,087 --> 01:23:28,555
That's not how I remember it.

989
01:23:30,967 --> 01:23:32,161
Why did you do it?

990
01:23:32,367 --> 01:23:34,198
Money, Hubert. A lot of money.

991
01:23:35,807 --> 01:23:38,480
You can't live on President Coty's smile.

992
01:23:38,767 --> 01:23:40,883
Lots of money, thanks to that!

993
01:23:43,167 --> 01:23:45,078
- Excuse me.
- Can I have a second?

994
01:23:45,287 --> 01:23:47,517
- Can I have my arms?
- Over there.

995
01:23:47,727 --> 01:23:49,046
This is boring me.

996
01:23:49,247 --> 01:23:51,124
I want my arms and him dead.

997
01:23:51,327 --> 01:23:53,522
We're getting there...

998
01:23:54,607 --> 01:23:57,121
Imam... claim your prize.

999
01:24:00,567 --> 01:24:02,285
So long, OSS 117.

1000
01:24:04,807 --> 01:24:06,320
Die for your sins.

1001
01:24:06,527 --> 01:24:07,960
Larmina, what a surprise!

1002
01:24:08,167 --> 01:24:10,362
- Mr. Jefferson.
- See? He's not dead!

1003
01:24:10,567 --> 01:24:11,443
I was sure of it.

1004
01:24:11,647 --> 01:24:13,205
The entire S.C.E.P. Is here.

1005
01:24:13,407 --> 01:24:15,284
Who goes first? You or her?

1006
01:24:15,487 --> 01:24:17,364
Drop your gun, Jefferson!

1007
01:24:18,447 --> 01:24:22,122
You double-crossed me
and went with the Eagles instead.

1008
01:24:22,327 --> 01:24:25,922
The lmam bid higher.
But now I'll take your offer.

1009
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:27,719
Here's my offer.

1010
01:24:28,407 --> 01:24:29,476
Take it or leave it.

1011
01:24:29,687 --> 01:24:32,918
Women! Once you let them
out of the kitchen...

1012
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:35,120
It's to clean up!

1013
01:25:04,727 --> 01:25:05,876
Enough!

1014
01:25:09,687 --> 01:25:10,676
I said enough!

1015
01:26:06,727 --> 01:26:07,477
Enough!

1016
01:26:09,407 --> 01:26:11,477
Listen, Princess!
Tell me exactly...

1017
01:26:15,367 --> 01:26:16,641
Make haste!

1018
01:26:17,127 --> 01:26:18,924
We have a boat to catch.

1019
01:26:29,727 --> 01:26:31,046
There, Larmina.

1020
01:26:31,927 --> 01:26:33,246
Order is restored.

1021
01:26:35,047 --> 01:26:38,357
Egypt will be at peace
for centuries to come.

1022
01:26:45,847 --> 01:26:47,439
I meant to tell you...

1023
01:26:48,167 --> 01:26:50,397
Maybe I shocked you a few times.

1024
01:26:51,447 --> 01:26:52,084
Yes.

1025
01:26:54,687 --> 01:26:55,358
At least twice.

1026
01:26:55,567 --> 01:26:59,480
My penchant for clean cars,
and the fact that I don't smoke.

1027
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:02,156
Thanks to you,
I learned something.

1028
01:27:04,727 --> 01:27:06,285
The mambo!

1029
01:27:09,327 --> 01:27:10,999
I can never thank you enough.

1030
01:27:11,967 --> 01:27:13,286
<i>La choukrane</i>.

1031
01:27:17,007 --> 01:27:19,237
You still have some stuff to learn.

1032
01:27:20,487 --> 01:27:21,761
Oh yes, like what?

1033
01:28:11,967 --> 01:28:15,880
<i>Cairo Bombing</i>
<i>Nasser Declares State of Emergency</i>

1034
01:28:19,727 --> 01:28:20,921
What an idiot.

1035
01:28:21,127 --> 01:28:22,526
<i>Football Scandal</i>

1036
01:28:22,727 --> 01:28:25,321
Good to see you.
How's the veal stew?

1037
01:28:27,007 --> 01:28:27,723
Excellent.

1038
01:28:27,927 --> 01:28:30,725
I'm glad to hear
your mission's a success.

1039
01:28:31,047 --> 01:28:32,765
Good work, OSS 117.

1040
01:28:32,967 --> 01:28:34,400
I did my duty.

1041
01:28:34,847 --> 01:28:36,280
But still...

1042
01:28:37,447 --> 01:28:39,278
- Something troubles me.
- What?

1043
01:28:39,487 --> 01:28:40,806
The weenie rumors.

1044
01:28:41,487 --> 01:28:42,886
The higher-ups are wondering.

1045
01:28:43,087 --> 01:28:45,555
- You told Coty?
- Hubert, I had to.

1046
01:28:45,767 --> 01:28:48,565
- I swear, I never...
- As long as you're happy.

1047
01:28:48,767 --> 01:28:50,678
I never did anything!

1048
01:28:51,567 --> 01:28:52,761
Miss?

1049
01:28:52,967 --> 01:28:54,116
Sir.

1050
01:29:00,967 --> 01:29:02,116
Thank you, Miss.

1051
01:29:02,327 --> 01:29:03,726
At your service.

1052
01:29:04,567 --> 01:29:07,400
What you did with the weenies,
you did for France.

1053
01:29:08,767 --> 01:29:11,201
Given your total success in Egypt,

1054
01:29:11,407 --> 01:29:13,159
and your knowledge of Muslim culture,

1055
01:29:13,367 --> 01:29:15,164
I'm sending you to Iran.

1056
01:29:15,367 --> 01:29:18,040
I'd be delighted.
Another excuse to fly!

1057
01:29:18,247 --> 01:29:19,600
I'm envious, Hubert.

1058
01:29:20,167 --> 01:29:23,682
Iran is beautiful.
They really appreciate Westerners.

1059
01:29:23,887 --> 01:29:28,085
Westerners are appreciated everywhere,
if we show goodwill.
