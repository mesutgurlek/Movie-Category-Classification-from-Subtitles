OK.

So. How are you going to get

Otto might get jealous.

That's what it says in the book.

505
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,398
Let's take, for example,
my friend George Thomason.

Right.

- Thomason?

Yes.

Yes. Do you know him?

I'm his barrister, his lawyer.

you're defending him!

Well, anyway.

524

At the committal,
George would then plead...

525
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,232
Not guilty.

526

Really?

527
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,358
The evidence is largely circumstantial.

528
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,835
But wasn't there an identification?

00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,791
True, but a very elderly lady.

I think they've got the wrong man.

You don't think he did it?

No.

533
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,109
Let's just say,
for argument's sake,...

534
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,992
...that you did think he did it.

535
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,157
Sure, if more evidence
against him came to light.

536
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,235
Right, right.

537
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,557
You would then advise him
to plead guilty,...

538
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,355
...and turn over the jewels
to get his sentence cut.

539
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,948
And he would turn them over
to who, to you?

540

Theoretically, yes, yes.

It's a Buddhist meditation technique.

00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,996
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

1005
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,519
Isn't it wonderful?

1006
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,039
Whose is it?

1007
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,469
It belongs to someone
at the chambers.

1008
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,749
And where are they?

1009
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,788
Hong Kong.

1010
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,875
Ah so.

1011
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,516
Gone for weeks.

1012
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,710
Nice rug, Archie.

1013
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,513
May I?

1014
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,712
Archie, what are you doing?

1015
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,989
The polka, I think.

1016
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,396
You make me feel free!

1017
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,033
Free?

1018
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,835
Do you have any idea what
it's like being English?

1019
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,235
Being so correct all the time?

1020
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:57,753
Being so... stifled by this
dread of doing the wrong thing?

1021
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,155
Asking someone,
"Are you married?"...

1022
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,236
...and hearing,
"My wife left me".

1023
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,715
Or saying,
"Do you have children?"...

1024
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:08,072
...and hearing,
"They burned to death yesterday".

1025
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,034
Wanda, we're all terrified
of embarrassment.

1026
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,400
That's why we're so... dead.

1027
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,391
Most of my friends are dead.

1028
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,988
We have these piles
of corpses to dinner.

1029
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,436
But you're alive, God bless you.

1030
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,120
And I want to be.
I'm so fed up with all this.

1031
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,349
I want to make love with you, Wanda.

1032
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,075
I'm a good lover.

1033
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,795
At least, I used to be
in the early 14th century.

1034
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,236
Can we go to bed?

1035
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,759
Yeah.

1036

Hang on!

1037

00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,632
Agh! Aagh!

1039
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,512
Aaagh! Aaagh!

1040
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,312
I think I love you, Wanda.

1041
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,396
Oh, Archie.

1042
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,397
Can I ask you a question?

1043
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,475
Anything.

1044
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,556
Where's my locket?

1045
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,749
I couldn't get it.

1046
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,995
What?

1047
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,270
Wendy wouldn't give it back.
Look...

1048
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,913
I got you this instead.

1049
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,792
Do you like it?

1050
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,514
No. Archie, I have to have mine.

1051
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,279
What's the matter? Why?

1052
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,594
My mother gave it to me...

1053
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:29,517
...on her death... bed.

1054
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,437
Oh, I'm sorry.

1055
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,913
All right, darling.

1056
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,473
I'll get it for you.

1057

You promise?

1058
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,193
I'll think of something.

1059
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,515
Sex is very, very difficult for me...

1060
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,712
...with somebody that
I don't trust completely.

1061
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,237
I promise I'll get it. OK?

1062
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,833
Ooh! I love you, Archie.

1063

the first second I saw you!

He doesn't have a clue.

was where Lincoln lived.

he told about the CIA!

When he heard your daughter's
name was Portia,...

I do. I offer a complete

1829
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:45,759
Give me your best shot.

1830
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:47,836
Go on, you don't have the guts.

1831
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:49,279
Admit it.

1832
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:52,594
OK, you have the guts.

1833
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:54,153
Good. Wait.

1834
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:55,713
Death!

1835
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:58,752
All right, I'm sorry
I ate your fish, OK?!

1836
01:38:58,880 --> 01:38:59,995
I'm sorry!

1837
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:01,235
Revenge!

1838
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,032
Jesus, I said I'm sorry.

1839
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,071
What the fu...? Aaagh!

1840
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,036
Got him!

1841
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:16,915
[Engines roar]

1842
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:20,996
[Laughs]
Gotcha again!

1843
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,712
You bastard!

1844
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:25,469
Hey! I've lost my stutter.

1845
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:27,749
It's gone.

1846
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:28,835
I can speak.

1847
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:31,428
How much wood could
a woodchuck chuck,...

1848
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,676
...if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

1849
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:34,915
[Laughs]

1850
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:36,315
Good afternoon, sir.

1851
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:37,395
Boarding pass?

1852
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:38,748
[Panting]

1853
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,191
Buongiorno, signorina.

1854
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:56,873
Now, listen. Two things.

1855
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,513
One.

1856
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:02,155
Behave yourself from now on,
or I'll break your neck, OK.

1857
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,395
Two.

1858
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:06,755
Gorbachov.

1859
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:08,315
Glasnost.

1860
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,075
Molotov.

1861
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:12,515
Blinis.

1862
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,790
Er... Lenin.

1863
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,036
Pushkin.

1864
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:19,309
Chicken Kiev.

1865
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,715
Good. Dostoevsky.

1866
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,353

01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,432
Vladivostok.

1868
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:29,232
[Engines roar]

1869
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:37,239
Assho-o-ole!
