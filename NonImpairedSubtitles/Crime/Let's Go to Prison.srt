JOHN:
Our justice system sucks,

45
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,936
You know, there are over
two million Americans
behind bars,

46
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:31,040
That's a little larger
than the population
of Houston,

(ALL CHEERING)

48
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,643
Every year,
there are enough children

49
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,519
born in prison to fill
250 Little League teams

50
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,416
and enough people
are raped in prison

51
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,551
to fill a stadium
more than three times,

52
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,686
Can you picture that?

53
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,060
Three stadiums full of people
raping each other?

54
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,366
I know I can,

55
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:51,462
My name's John Lyshitski,
I just got out of prison,

56
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,204
(MUSIC PLAYING)

57
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:00,136
I don't know.
Do you have
anything bigger?

58
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,648
Yeah.
That's more Iike it.

59
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,779
If I had a nickel
for every time
I've been incarcerated,

60
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,154
I'd have 15 cents,

61
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,593
It all started when
I was eight years old,

62
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,494
I stole the Publishers
Clearing House
prize patrol van,

63
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,259
Thought there'd be
a million bucks inside,

64
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,027
Where's the check?
Where's the check?

65
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,089
Wait!

66
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:26,301
They caught me when I tried
to cash the giant check,

67
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,674
That was the first time I met
Judge Nelson Biederman,

68
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,472
who changed my life
with the magic word,

69
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,637
Guilty.

70
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,344
You see, Johnny,

71
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,680
the reason we have
all these Iaws
and rules to Iive by

72
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:40,712
is so that
we can help guide

73
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,017
all the Iittle boys
with big dreams

74
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,886
and a chance
for a bright future,

75
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,358
and so that
we could help protect them

76
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,622
from worthless scum
Iike you.

77
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,496
Seven years,
juvenile detention.

00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,666
JOHN: And with that,
Judge Biederman

79
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,930
began my trip
through the justice machine,

80
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,403
The machine works,

81
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,337
It took me,
a confused child,

82
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,875
and turned me
into a for-real,
no-shit felon,

83
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,471
Hey!

84
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,513
Hit the ground,
motherfuckers

85
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,311
or I'II fill you
full of more holes
than the Asshole Day parade.

86
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,612
There's an
Asshole Day parade?

87
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,854
Motherfucker.

88
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,158
Guilty.

89
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:29,162
Four years,
and if being a moron
were a crime, Mr. Lyshitski,

90
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,467
you would never see
the Iight of day again.

91
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,562
JOHN: I got out again
when I was 24,

92
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,574
Then that same ass-wipe,
Judge Biederman,

93
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,906
sent me back
when I was 24 and a half,

94
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,270
Four to seven years.

95
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,404
The next time
you steal a car,
Mr. Lyshitski,

96
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,073
check to see if there
are Iights on the roof.

97
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,480
(LAUGHING)

98

You Iiked that one?

99
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,948
JOHN: I'm out again,
and I intend to spread
the pain around,

100
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,381
Starting with
His Honor himself,

101
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,354
Take him down piece by piece,

102
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,556
Kick off his dog,
strangle his cat,

103
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,498
shit in his pillowcase,
burn down his garage,

104
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,660
Then I'll get really creative,

105
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:04,896
Hello?

106
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,205
Hi. Is this the
municipal courthouse?

107
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:11,769
Great.
My name is Ken Kennedy.

108
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,742
I'm calling from
the Chicago Tribune,

109
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,577
Yes, we're doing
a story down here

110
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,050
on some of the city's
Iongest-serving public figures

111
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:24,590
and we would Iove to see
Judge Nelson Biederman III
at work.

112
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:29,486
So could you tell us
which times this week
that he will be on the bench?

113
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,126
Uh-huh.

114
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,944
And how Iong ago
did you say that he died?

115
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,521
Three days! Fuck!

Robbed.

120
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,057
Anybody want to buy me
a champagne drink?

121
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,203
How about a fancy beer?

122
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,437
15 bucks for a Iap dance.

123
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:53,143
Yeah, I'm not that horny.
I just got out of prison.

when one door slams shut,
another one swings open,

127
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,160
Well, look out, Nelly,
You're about to meet

128
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,725
the other man
your father helped raise,

Crimes are everywhere,

they're in our streets,
and they're in our schools,

That's why I need you
to be part of,,,

are you guys?

Well, why the hell
do I have to be here
if you don't?

134
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,319
Yeah, I know
he was my father.

135
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,186
Thanks for the
fucking newsflash.

136

Don't give me
that shit, Duane.

JOHN: Hello, Nelly.

138
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:47,363
I give you now
the new chairman
of the Biederman Foundation

139
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:51,233
whose generosity
has made this all possible,

140
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,871
Nelson Biederman IV,

141
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,482
I want to thank you all
for attending this honorarium

142
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,017
for my dear,
departed Daddy,

143
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:14,120
Now, boys and girls,
are you ready to have
your minds blown?

144
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,429
Well, what you got, Nelson?

145
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,414
A lot of people didn't think
that this neighborhood needed

146
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:44,889
a $7-million,
original Yoko Ono,

147
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:49,550
Well, those people didn't
grow up on these streets,

148
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,227
And maybe I didn't either,

149
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,959
but I am forced
to drive through here
on my way to the airport

150
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,593
and I believe that
anything that I can do

151
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:01,072
to make your lives and
my drive more beautiful
is worth doing,

That's why I,

00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,232
I'll go to jail,

315
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,573
I'll get bunked up
with Nelson Biederman IV

316
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,840
and I'll make sure
he gets the full treatment,

317
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,542
Yup, My whole life's
been leading up to this,

318
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,912
Guilty as hell.
Guilty?

319
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,317
Now if we could
discuss sentencing?

320
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,411
Save it, Lyshitski.

321
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,580
How does seven-to-ten
work for you?

322
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,680
Not as good
as one-to-three.

323
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:19,883
Five-to-seven?

324
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,550
I'II settle for three-to-five,
but wait. There's more.

325
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,754
What's that?
I want to do my time
in Rossmore.

326
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,127
You actually want to go to
Rossmore Penitentiary? Why?

327
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,929
Three words, sister.
Location, Iocation, Iocation.

328
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,041
Hey. John Lyshitski.

329
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,777
What's your name?

330
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,247
Nelson Biederman IV.

331
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,219
Where you heading?

332
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,222
Prison.

333
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,418
(SCOFFS)

334
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,858
Me, too.

335
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,533
Tell you what,
we should be cellmates.

336
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:10,699
I don't snore
and I'm a pretty
quiet masturbator.

337
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,405
Hell, I'II even
give you the top bunk.

338
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,744
Thanks.

339
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,347
Thanks for
talking to me.

340
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,015
Last couple days
in the holding cell,

341
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:31,494
some of these
gang members

342
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,665
were really giving me
the cold shoulder.

343
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,592
It's inexcusable.

344
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:37,828
That's what I thought.

345
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,871
I mean,
why be that way?

346
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,230
WARDEN:
Welcome to your new home.

347
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:11,430
Let me start off by saying
that if any one of you
is innocent,

348
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,934
just raise your hand.

349
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,836
You'II be free to go.

350
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,569
MAN 1: Come on, baby!
You gonna be mine!

351
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,803
Yeah, we're tossing salad!
That's what I'm talking about!

352
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,007
Put your Iittle finger up,
baby! Yeah!

353
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,046
You gonna be my bitch
up in here!

354
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,614
(GRUNTS)

355
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,529
That was my Iittle joke.

356
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,633
I have a notoriously
dry sense of humor.

357
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,602
AII right.
Here's how it's gonna work.

358
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,472
If you make
my Iife difficult,

359
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:59,379
I will make your Iife
exponentially more painful.

360
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,542
MAN 2: Yeah!

361
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,210
If you have a complaint,

362
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,020
all you have to do,

363
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,522
write it down
on a piece of paper,

364
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,959
put it in an envelope

365
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,860
and stick it up
your asshole.

366
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:15,764
MAN 3:
Give me some brown sugar!
Tell them how we do it, boy!

367
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,199
(CHUCKLING)

368
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:22,667
If you feel that you've
been treated unfairly,

369
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:28,106
write it neatly on some paper,
fold it up real good,

370
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:32,008
pull your cheeks apart
and stick it up your asshole.

371
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:42,622
If you have comments
or suggestions about
how I run my prison

372
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:47,654
or, Iet's say,
maybe the cuisine
is not to your Iiking,

373
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,129
please write a Ietter
to my office.

374
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:57,741
Just make sure that
under "return address,"
you write the word "asshole,"

375
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:01,710
so that my head guard,
Mr. Shanahan, can assist you

376
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,338
in pulling
your cheeks apart

377
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,076
and sticking it up
your asshole.

378
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,948
MAN 4: He's got some
pretty eyes. Pretty Iips.

379
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,983
WARDEN:
Come on, that was funny.

380
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,785
GUARD: AII right! Move it out!

381
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:21,026
Cell 433. I want you
to sign right there.

382
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,265
Move off, Biederman.

383
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,899
Lyshitski, John Q.

384
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,464
Hello, Johnny.
How you doing?

385
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,602
(CHUCKLING)
Rooney. No glasses.
You got the surgery.

386
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,577
Yes, I did.

387
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:39,014
One Metallica t-shirt,
Master of Puppets,

388
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,708
One money clip.

389
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,120
I'd Iike to room
with Biederman.

390
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:50,758
Empty. Cell number 433.

391
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:52,821
Sign right there.

392
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,297
Can I get my old shit?

393
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,594
Give it to him.

394
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:59,660
JOHN:
So fate, with a little help
from every last nickel I had,

395
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:04,402
threw me into a cell
with the esteemed
Nelson Biederman IV,

396
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:08,071
Today is the first day
of the rest
of my beautiful life,

397
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,614
People think
they can't imagine

398
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,310
what it feels like
to be in prison,

399
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:14,510
It's easy,

400
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,110
You know that
bolt of fear you get

401
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:19,123
when you see a cop's
flashing red lights
in your rear view?

402
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,625
It makes you dizzy and
kind of sick to your stomach,

403
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,025
Now imagine feeling that
24 hours a day

404
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:27,656
while you're surrounded
by convicted killers
who feel the exact same way,

405
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,859
It'd kind of put you
on edge, huh?

406
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,267
Well, that's life
in the machine,

407
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,737
Nobody's here to relax,
and once you're in,

408
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,967
there's only one
quick way out,

409
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,407
In a body bag,

410
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,275
MAN 1 : Dead man rolling!
MAN 2: Dead man rolling!

411
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,012
Wait...

412
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,918
Well, be it ever so humble.

413
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,597
I'II just
take the top.

414
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,196
It doesn't seem Iike
they cleaned this toilet up.

415
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,798
It's disgusting.

416
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:14,075
MAN 1: Hey, bro, hold it.
You got two minutes.

417
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,476
(CRYING)

418
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,880
MAN 2: You want in on it?
Come on. What we got here?

419
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:27,118
Look, amigo, if you're
gonna make it in here,
you better smarten up.

420
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:32,092
Those pricks out there
see you Iike this,
you won't make it a week.

421
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,358
You don't wanna die
in your first week,
do you?

422
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,524
(SOBBING) No.

423
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,463
Right.

424
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,633
So you got to trust me.
Do what I do.

425
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,576
Just keep your mouth shut
and try not to cry.

426
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,278
It's all right to cry.

427
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,545
Crying takes the sad
out of you.

428
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,644
"Crying takes the sad
out of you"?

429
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,653
Hey, that shit may
have flown back when
you were a human being,

430
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,748
but you're not now.
You're a piece of meat
and you're in the grinder.

431
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:02,452
The softer you are,
the more it's gonna
grind you up,

432
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:05,325
and the more them animals
are gonna wanna eat you.

433
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,865
AII right,
you gotta toughen up.

434
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,501
Show me your tough face.

435
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,964
Show me Nelson's
tough face.

436
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,807
Jesus, you Iook Iike you're
going to take a shit,
or something.

437
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,906
Hey, John.
How you doing?

438
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,383
Same Lyshitski,
different day.

439
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,352
Got some mail for you.

440
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,020
Bit backed up.
Couple weeks.

441
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,489
Who's the new guy?

442
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,085
That is Nelson Biederman IV.

443
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,863
He got to take
a shit or something?

444
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,433
JOHN: No, he's trying
to Iook Iike bad meat.
Yeah.

445
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,540
Okay.

446
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,245
MAN 3: Now keep it quiet
down there.

447
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:05,152
Look at this,
we can order out.

448
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,822
MAN 4: I need some
toilet paper, what's up?

449
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,084
MAN 5: Well, we got to you.

450
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,220
So now what do we do?

451
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,453
Hmm?

452
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,827
What do you mean?

453
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,826
What do I mean?

454
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:22,335
I mean, what are we...
What are we supposed to do?

455
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,107
We're doing it, man.
This is it.

456
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:29,104
We're right in
the thick of the action.

457
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,614
We hang out here,
go to Iunch,

458
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,981
come back, hang out some more,
go to dinner.

459
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,448
You know how someone
might describe a situation

460
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:42,550
that's unpleasant or confining
as being "Iike a prison"?

461
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:47,830
Yeah.
This is what
they were referring to.

462
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,667
MAN 6: Cállate la boca!

463
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,233
JOHN: It costs $54 a day
to keep a person in prison,

464
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:58,332
which comes out to
$75 million a day nationally,

465
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,571
That's $28 billion a year,

466
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,044
When you think about it,

467
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:05,105
wouldn't it be cheaper
just to let us keep
your goddamn car stereos?

468
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,216
What's on the menu today,
good sir?

469
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:16,185
That's meat.
That ain't meat.

470
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,428
Ain't meat.

471
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,559
Hit me with some meat.

472
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:26,831
MAN: Hey, come on,
hurry up.

473
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,477
Great American
melting pot.

474
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,504
You know,
20% of all prisoners
aren't even US citizens?

475
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:40,779
About 10% are Mexican,
2% Colombian.

476
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,979
I can't
tell the difference.

477
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,653
How do you know
all this stuff, John?

478
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,215
I'm on a Iot of
weird mailing Iists.

479
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,420
See those bad asses
over there?

480
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:51,689
They're the White Kingdom.

481
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,492
They pretty much
run the roost.

482
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:58,629
He who controls the smack,
controls the joint,
and by "he," I mean him.

483
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,967
Lynard.
Don't be fooled, though.

484
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,202
Underneath all those swastikas
he's a real prick.

485
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,139
MAN 1: Hey, hey.
You ain't gonna
eat that, right?

486
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,950
At exactly 12:15,
stand up.

487
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:15,744
Why?

488
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:19,055
Just do it.
It's kind of a prank.

489
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:20,982
Oh.

490
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:24,820
We used to
do this sort of thing
all the time at prep school.

491
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:28,491
A couple of the boys
wanted to put one over
on old Professor LaRoche.

492
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,965
(CHUCKLING)

493
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,865
At exactly
the appointed minute,

494
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:35,702
all the boys would
push their books
down onto the floor.

495
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,004
OId LaRoche almost
had a heart attack...
Oh, shit. Not the face.

496
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,566
Not the face!

497
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,935
(SCREAMING)

498
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,481
Break it up!
Break it up!

499
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,309
You, fish,
who started this shit?

500
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,684
(GROANING)
Leave it alone.

501
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:51,744
(SCREAMS)

502
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:56,953
He did.

503
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:59,588
AII right, Lynard,
you're going to the hole.

504
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:03,065
Lunch is over, Iadies,
hit the showers! Move it!

505
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,099
That's gotta be the stupidest
goddamn thing I've ever seen.

506
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,767
Never narc on somebody.

507
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,606
I mean,
haven't you seen
any prison movies?

508
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:14,667
You told me to.

509
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,873
Yeah. I didn't mean
for you to tell the truth.

510
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:21,044
You're dead, and I'II probably
gonna get kicked in the teeth
just for talking to you.

511
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,484
I'm sorry.

512
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,747
Okay.

513
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,453
Listen, from now on you do
exactly as I say. Exactly.

514
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,361
Okay?
Okay.

515
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,332
Just remember,
number one rule in prison,

516
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,368
always Iook out
for your cellmate.

517
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,535
JOHN: Remember,
the number one rule in prison,

518
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,905
never trust anybody,

519
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,583
Of all the fears
men have about prison,

520
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:55,744
Ioss of liberty,
eating bad food,

521
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,845
claustrophobia, loneliness,

522
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:01,881
none of them compare
to the prospect of
being fucked up the ass,

523
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,258
So,
what's a beautiful
white boy Iike you

524
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,990
doing in a place
Iike this?

525
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,055
Three to five.

526
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:11,925
Soft time, huh?

527
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,030
Yeah.

528
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,936
I Iike soft things.

529
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,040
You know,
Iike, soft music,

530
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,775
maybe a soft
Iittle baby duck
on Easter morning.

531
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:28,813
You Iike Iittle baby ducks?

532
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,721
Hey, back the hell off,
Barry.

533
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,591
He's my bitch.

534
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,227
Hey, Lyshitski,
how's it hanging?

535
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,930
Little to the right,
I see.

536
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,096
Hey, he's my property,
dickmonster.

537
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,996
You guys got that?

538
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,901
This Iittle filly's all mine.

539
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,906
You can Iook,
but don't touch.

540
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:53,273
Juliet's asshole's got
one name stenciled on it.
Mine.

541
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:57,110
Romeo. Romeo Lyshitski.
Capisce, amigos?

542
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,978
No rear entry.

543
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,946
That goes for you.

544
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,682
That big bastard's
the head of the BIack G-Lords.

545
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:15,098
I don't mean to sound
ungrateful, John,

546
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:18,294
but did you have to stick
your finger up my ass?

547
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,901
No. Probably not.

548
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,701
But it happened.

549
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,512
You've gotta get me
out of here. Now!

550
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,911
Before I become
bitch du jour for
one of the G-Lords.

551
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:33,143
I don't care how much
it costs. I want out.

552
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,642
Well, that's just it,
Mr. Biederman,

553
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,984
you don't have any money.

554
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,183
What're you talking about?
I have millions.

555
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,317
Well, the Foundation does,
yes,

556
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:46,159
but Iegally,
you have no access
to the Foundation's funds

557
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,324
unless you are chairman,
which you are no Ionger.

558
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,369
My father started
the Biederman Foundation.

559
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:56,203
My name is Nelson Biederman!
You can't fire me!

560
00:32:56,774 --> 00:33:00,870
Actually, according to
the Foundation's charter,
we were required to.

561
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:04,244
So, without Foundation funds,
you don't have a dime.

562
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,682
Unless you've been working
a paper route on the side.

563
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,151
(LAUGHING)

564
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,679
I'm so sorry.

565
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:17,158
That's why I brought you
a Fresca.

566

MAN 1: Hey, hey. Sit down.

567
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,129
After all,
we are a charity.

568
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:26,025
So here. Just Iean in.
Go ahead.

569
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,038
GUARD: No food or drinks!
Oh.

570
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,906
Ouch.
I'm sorry, Mr. Biederman.

571
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,305
MAN 2: Hurry it up.
A Iot of people waiting.

576
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,290
Thank you
for the pencil, John.

577
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,559
No problem.
Found it in the shitter.

578
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,315
AII right, Johnny,
how much for real?

579
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,220
Well, he's a really
good friend of mine.

580
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:09,460
I couldn't possibly
Iet you have him for
anything Iess than, say,

581
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:13,064
half ounce of grass,
four cartons of smokes?

582
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:16,601
Shit. Honky, please.
You out your mind?

583
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,904
Hey, you want to
break off a piece
of that white chocolate,

584
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,637
it's going to cost you.

585
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,716
Well, shit.

586
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,385
Your name must be Monty Hall,
motherfucker,

587
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:33,718
'cause
we just made a deal.

588

Come on, man!

591
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,568
What's with the robe,
John?

592
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,613
Well, if you wanna
keep getting the catalog,

593
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,775
you got to order something
every now and again.

594
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,341
Figured I'd get
more use out of this
than a Miracle Bra.

(BANGING ON CELL)

(WHISTLES)

598
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,919
Wait, you're not gonna
Ieave me in here
by myself, are you?

599
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,898
I'II be back in 20 minutes.
Just remember your tough face.

600
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,464
Oh, spooky.

601

Looks Iike he has to

JOHN: Hold the fort, amigo,

603
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,755
Hey, thanks, Shanahan.

604
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,225
Don't thank me, asshole,
just pay me.

(GROANING)

607
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:16,916
I'd Iike to apologize
for the crassness
of my associates.

608
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:23,266
I doubt very much
if they've even cracked
the binding on Emily Post,

609
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,564
Would you Iike some merlot?

610
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,545
I make it in the toilet.

611

Are you Pisces?

612
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,922
Yeah, I knew it.

613
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:53,157
How do you do it, Barry?
How do you do it?

614
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,190
So what shall we drink to?

615
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,304
Oh, I know.

616
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,366
Serendipity.

617
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,310
What a delightful
force of nature,
serendipity.

618
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,119
Yummy.

619
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:28,554
Look here, Nelson,
can I ask you a question?

620
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,663
Does my ass
Iook big to you?

621
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:42,905
No?
Liar!

622

I'm gonna have

you still got three options.

743
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,847
You could kill yourself,
you could fight him,

744

or you could just
Iet him kill you,

745
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,984
which honestly might be
your best solution.

746
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,755
Or you could always
move out to the boondocks.

doing yourself in, are you?

782
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,910
My friend,
I'm all out of smack today,

783
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,579
but you may be in Iuck.

784
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,115
Because I've got some
very nice alternatives.

785
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:47,672
Paprika.

786
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,116
That's right. Paprika.

787
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:53,384
A mere two, three pounds
of this stuff, boom!
To the moon.

788
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:56,426
Only side effects may be
some mild-to-uncontrollable
shitting.

789
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,188
I need something
that will kill me.

790
00:49:58,261 --> 00:49:59,660
Oh, it's Iike that.

791
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:02,194
I don't condone that,
my friend,

792
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:06,097
but pretty much
any of this shit'II kill you.

793
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:10,836
Oh yeah, I got old
standard drain cleaner.

797
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:23,245
This is something
called boat cleaner.

798
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:28,117
I think it's used
to clean boats with.

799
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:32,055

and a needle.

01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:32,583
Don't you have eyes?

940
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:34,027
In the hole!

941
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,989
JOHN: The system
is one shifty prick,

942
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:39,057
You dodge right,
it shifts left,

943
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,195
You think you're on top of it,
suddenly you're underneath it,

944
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,869
The ass end
of the punch-line,

945
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:53,473
During my retreat,
Nelson had become
king of the crapper,

946
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:55,547
and nobody seemed to flinch,

947
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:01,381
Just the opposite,

948
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:03,516
They're eating up his
fancy-ass rich-boy act

949
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,754
Iike he was Ben & Jerry's
Heroin Chunk,

950
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,820
So at exactly
the appointed minute

951
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:12,026
when old LaRoche's
back is turned,

952
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:15,898
all the boys shoved
their books onto the floor.

953
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,564
(ALL LAUGHING)

954
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,870
OId LaRoche almost
had a heart attack.

955
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:21,375
He didn't know
what hit him.

956
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,606
Can't wait to see
your grand premiere, baby.

957
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,582
From the tippety,
cocksuckers!

958
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:29,842
Five, six, seven, eight...

959
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:36,356
(SINGING)

960
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:50,368
Go, John. Go, John.

961
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,076
(JOHN WHISTLING)

962
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,645
Phillips head.

963
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,553
Hey, John.
Hey.

964
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,557
Didn't see you there.

965
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,521
It's good to see you.
Yeah.

966
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:15,661
You know,
I've been meaning to
talk to you about something.

967
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,200
What's that?
Remember when
I first got in here?

968
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,330
I had the balls of a soufflé,
I'II be honest with you.

969
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:24,532
But you changed that, John,
you really did.
Did I?

970
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:25,631
Yeah.

971
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:28,472
I owe everything that
I am today to you, John.
I really do.

972
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:31,240
I mean, you gave me
my self-esteem back.

973
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,248
I've got the Iove of a man.
Wow, good!

974
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:34,578
AII the things
that you could want.

975
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,777
I found myself and
I just feel Iike
I really wanna

976
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,083
give you something,
John, I do.
Perfect! Yeah.

977
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:41,055
Can I get you
some cigarettes?
No. I'm good.

978
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:45,424
What about porn?
Cigarettes and porn?
No. I'm good.

979
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,989
John, you're the greatest.

980
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,466
I wanna say, from
the bottom of my heart...
Yeah?

981
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:54,162
Thank you.
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

982
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:55,895
Hey, have some tea.
Hey, thanks.

983
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,872
Made it for you.
Okay.

984
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:00,404
AII right, have fun.

985
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,075
Come on!

986
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,649
JOHN: How did this happen?

987
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:11,448
A few months ago,
I had his balls in a vise,

988
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:13,955
Now with his parole hearing
just around the bend,

989
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:17,584
it looks like he might
be taking his balls
and going home,

990
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:28,501
Hold still.
You got to Iook
good for court.

991
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:32,263
There you go.

992
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:36,205
You wanna go out tonight?

993
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:37,712
Me and some of the guys
were thinking about

994
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,304
going down
to the Iaundry room,

995
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:40,974
drinking some
toilet wine,

996
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:42,948
and beating up
some of the new guys.

997
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:48,156
Or we could just stay in
and drink toilet wine here.

998
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:51,927
We never go out anymore.

999
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:11,275
Well, I've got to
hand it to you, buddy.

1000
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,282
You're a bigger man
than I thought you were.

1001
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:16,243
They beat you up,

1002
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:18,148
they robbed you
of your dignity,

1003
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:19,711
they pissed in your food,

1004
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:21,621
but they didn't break you.

1005
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,524
And with the
revolving-door policy
of today's prison system,

1006
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,686
you're probably gonna
get paroled tomorrow.

1007
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,722
They pissed in my food?

1008
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:31,198
What difference
does it make?

1009
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:34,701
You're getting out tomorrow
and I'm proud of you.

1010
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,328
Really?
Really.

1011
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:38,965
In fact,
I snuck you in
a going-away present.

1012
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:43,841
Good Iuck at your hearing.
I'II see you in 1-to-3.

1013
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:47,080
Thank you, John.
Okay.

1014
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:50,243
Couldn't have made it
in here without your help.

1015
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:57,326
Why is it
already opened?

1016
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,418
I opened it for you.
What for?

1017
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:03,465
'Cause I'm a great guy

1018
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:07,127
and I know
you had a real tough day.

1019
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:17,011
You don't trust me?

1020
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,470
After all
we've been through?

1021
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:21,413
One friend can't give
another friend a soda

1022
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:22,576
without that friend
thinking

1023
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:24,381
the second friend
put a roofie in it?

1024
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:27,182
Wow.
Well, that hurts, pal.

1025
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,079
That hurts.

1026
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:33,117
I've been
Iooking out for you
for almost a year now,

1027
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:36,631
and then I bust my nuts
getting you
this goddamn fruity soda

1028
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,099
and you think
I'm up to something?

1029
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:41,533
Well, screw you, pal.

1030
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,334
I thought we were friends.

1031
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:53,979
I'm sorry, John.

1032
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:56,908
God, this place
has really done
a number on me.

1033
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:58,180
It has.

1034
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,645
We are friends.

1035
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,624
In fact, you might be
the best friend I've ever had.

1036
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:08,956
That's it. Get it all.
Go for it.

1037
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:15,367
The taste of freedom.

1038
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,938
Oh, John, what would
this world be Iike without...

1039
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:24,603
(RETCHING)

1040
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:31,709
AII right,
maestro, come on,
Iet's get him out of here.

1041
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,086
We got to
put his new face on.

1042
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:45,566
Wake up, Biederman.
Parole board's waiting.

1043
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:51,868
Let's go.

1044
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:55,007
So, Mr. Biederman,

1045
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:57,844
do you feel you're ready
to re-enter society?

1046
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,042
Absolutely.

1047
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:02,316
Prison's made me a new man.

1048
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:04,449
When I get out of here,

1049
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:08,581
I intend to stand up
for what I know is right.

1050
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:12,391
JOHN: When the parole board
gets through with der Führer,

1051
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:14,326
two things
are going to happen,

1052
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:17,264
One, they're gonna file
his early release form

1053
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,801
right in between
Charles Manson
and the Unabomber's,

1054
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:26,737
And two,
Nelson's going to
be pissed as hell at me,

1055
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:34,139
Why'd you do it, John?

1056
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:36,343
Amigo, I did it
for your own good.

1057
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:39,682
Now hear me out
on this one, all right?

1058
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:44,220
Listen, you got to sandbag
your first parole hearing,
because...

1059
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:56,204
Okay, you want to know why?
I knew your dad.

1060
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:58,900
What?
Yeah. The judge.

1061
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:01,866
The man who made me
who I am today.

1062
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:05,309
The same man who's going
to kill you right now.

1063
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:06,871
What would you call that?

1064
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:09,747
I'd call that pretty crazy,
isn't it?

1065
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:13,284
No! It's ironic!

1066
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:20,921
The word you want
is "ironic"!

1067
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:21,985
(SCREAMS)

1068
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:27,627
AII right, cut the shit!
Get up, you mothers.
Get up, get up now!

1069
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:29,500
Get him up against the wall!
Go, go, go!

1070
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:31,699
(TASER GUNS BUZZING)
Get up! Get up!

1071
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:35,033
You two pussies
gonna have a cage match

1072
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,102
and I don't even
get an invitation?

1073
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:38,976
Wow, that's selfish.

1074
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:41,539
That's selfish.

1075
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:46,849
'Cause goddamn it,
I want a front-row seat
to that catfight.

1076
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:52,323
You two want to
kill each other?
Great, stupendous.

1077
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:56,693
Save everybody else
around here the hassle.
But this is my prison.

1078
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:01,436
I schedule the
extra-curricular activities.

1079
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:05,736
And if you two
are going to fight,

1080
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:10,037
I need some time
to get some action going.

1081
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:12,642
So, how's...

1082
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:18,443
How's Friday sound, huh?
Friday good? Say, rec yard?

1083
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:22,089
Fight to the death?

1084
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:25,319
Does that work for
you two dickheads?

1085
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:26,759
(BOTH GRUNTING)

1086
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,626
Sounds Iike a yes to me.

1087
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:31,227
Sounds Iike a yes.

1088
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:36,897
Wait.

1089
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:42,076
What do I win if I win?

1090
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:45,612
If you Iose, you die.
If you win, you die.

1091
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:48,678
The difference is

I've proven that the machine

1093
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:03,390
can warp a law-abiding,
spineless sack of shit
like Biederman

01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:07,128
into a totally violent,
psychopathic and lethal

You gotta ask Shanahan,

I'II put two cartons

Sure.

01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:09,321
are big fans
of Wine Aficionado magazine

1244
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:13,487
and I have to confess
that we are very eager
to hear your opinion.

1245
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:15,958
Be careful for what
you wish for, gentlemen.

1246
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:23,604
That first sniff
unlocks the door.

1247
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:27,273
Oh, and that second sniff
invites you in, sits you down,

1248
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:28,900
and gives you
a foot massage.

1249
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:30,467
Watch yourself.

1250
01:22:30,645 --> 01:22:32,476
What is it that I detect?

1251
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:36,210
A trace of ammonia
or some other sort
of disinfectant?

1252
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:38,411
No, it's ammonia.

1253
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,848
I see. Well, then
I'm done with it.

1254
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:45,626
You haven't even
tasted it yet.
Precisely.

1255
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:47,851
Well, at Ieast
Iet us introduce you

1256
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:49,692
to our head vintner.
He came up with...

1257
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:54,292
Gentlemen, I don't
need to taste your wine
nor meet your head vintner

1258
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:55,893
to confidently proclaim

1259
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:58,531
that this wine
is a piece of shit...

1260
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:00,631
A Iittle piece of heaven?

1261
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:02,871
Ken Kennedy, head vintner.

1262
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:05,210
See,
we're a family here

1263
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,973
and our grapes
are a part of that family.

1264
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:10,774
And they know that
we'd do anything for them.

1265
01:23:10,852 --> 01:23:13,821
For instance,
if some outsider,

1266
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:16,823
say, some shit-eating
fruit fly were to come in here

1267
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:19,451
and mess with them
in any way whatsoever,

1268
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:21,620
we, and by "we" I mean

1269
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:24,290
me and my brothers
over there,

1270
01:23:27,802 --> 01:23:29,861
would stop at nothing
to protect them,

1271
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:31,738
and they know that.

1272
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:34,508
So that is why I think

1273
01:23:34,576 --> 01:23:36,669
you're gonna score
Baby Duck wine 100 out of 100

1274
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:38,337
on your next review.

1275
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:41,314
Because you can taste
the Iove in every sip.

1276
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:42,805
Okay?

1277
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:45,814
Yes, I...

1278
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:48,014
Of course. 100 it is.

1279
01:23:48,656 --> 01:23:51,284
Do you hear that?
BARRY: Drink up, bitches.

Come on, John.

John, isn't this great?

1287
01:26:20,975 --> 01:26:23,569
Shake that body
for me, Johnny.

1288

Come on, Lyshitski.
