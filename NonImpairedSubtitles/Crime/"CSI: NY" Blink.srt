1
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,280
Detective Flack...

2
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,990
Called you the second I got word.

3
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,200
Caucasian female,late 20s, no I.D.

4
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,490
Some guy jogging his dog
found her and called 911.

5
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,910
Ran his name...
He's harmless.

6
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,290
I think he's all about the dog, you know.

7
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,580
Where is she?

8
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,680
Body's in a characteristic position-- supine.

9
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,680
Legs are crossed over,
arms flailed out to her sides.
Dump job.

10
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,890
Rape, dump?

11
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,400
She wasn't killed here.

12
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,820
There's no scuff marks on the knees.

13
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,490
Nails are intact.

14
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,200
It appears putrefaction has set in.

15
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,120
She's starting to bloat up a bit.

16
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,880
Which could explain the inconsistency of her belt.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,500
See the wear?

18
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,210
It's two notches off.

19
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,220
If the killer re-dressed her,
he did it at considerable amount of
time after death.

20
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,880
Why would he dress her back up?

21
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,010
I don't know.

22
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,520
What I do know is... he took the time.

23
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,790
Someone out there is missing a wife.

Season 1 - Episode 1
Blink

28
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,610
Morning, dear.

29
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,980
Do I have a tail back there?

30
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,280
Sorry. Morning, Stella.

31
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,200
Better.

32
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,910
Did you hear about that body?

33
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,120
The one by the River Cafe?

34
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,990
Yeah, I caught it on the police portable
when I was in the shower.

35
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,700
Why doesn't that surprise me?

36
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
The job never stops, Danny.

37
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,300
Did you go to autopsy?

38
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,310
Um, not yet.

39
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,480
What time did you get in?

40
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Never went home.

41
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,480
Can't sleep?

42
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,690
What's sleep?

43
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,980
Got anything on that Jane Doe?

44
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,490
We're still working on an I.D.

45
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,910
I'll comb through the local
missing persons database.

46
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,280
Time of death?

47
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,500
Approximation... days.

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,420
Good. Gives her enough time to be in the system.

49
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,380
I'll be at the M.E.'s.

50
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,800
A good morning would be nice.

51
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,380
Morning.

52
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,390
Dr. Hawkes.

53
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,190
Oh...Sorry.

54
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,610
Your Jane Doe did me in.

55
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,200
When you see her, you'll know why.

56
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,210
Okay... from the top, shall we?

57
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,210
Contusions and ecchymoses
around areas of the neck.

58
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,300
Strangulation?

59
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,390
Nothing in her eyes to indicate petechial hemorrhaging.

60
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,390
Before we get to cause of death,
you better see this.

61
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,480
Horizontal lividity slots
along the coronal plane.

62
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,280
She was on her back for awhile.

63
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,490
Agreat while.

64
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,110
Indicated by bedsores.

65
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Cause of death?

66
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,700
Hemorrhagic stroke.

67
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,700
She had two strokes actually.

68
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,710
Upon examination of the brain,
I found evidence of an ischemic stroke.
A process where blood
was cut off from the cerebrum.

69
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:23,880
The effects of the ischemic stroke caused
severe deterioration of blood vessels
in her brain,

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,380
which then led to a hemorrhagic conversion.

71
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,390
Two strokes.

72
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,180
What went on with this woman?

73
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,810
I'm afraid it doesn't stop there.

74
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,600
Histology indicates she inhaled
something her body didn't agree with.

75
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,690
Perimortem smoke inhalation?

76
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,610
She inhaled something just prior to death.

77
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,900
Run a full tox screen.

78
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,110
I want to know everything about this woman.

79
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,000
LeAnn Goodman.

80
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,090
I don't understand.

81
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,100
There must be some mistake.
This can't be my wife.

82
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,190
Mr. Goodman, would you feel more
comfortable if we arranged
a private viewing?

83
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,580
Are you gonna okay with this?

84
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,690
I realize this is a very trying time for you.

85
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,110
Could you tell us more about
the last time you were with your wife?

86
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,400
We had lunch that day.

87
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,610
I put her in a cab and we parted ways.

88
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,580
I'll see you tonight.

89
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,200
I love you. Bye...

90
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,290
That was the last time I saw her.

91
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,380
Tox screen came back on LeAnn Goodman.

92
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,300
Sex assault?

93
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,300
Negative, but Dr. Hawkes was dead on.

94
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,590
The wife inhaled something she shouldn't have.

95
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,600
"Fry" sticks.

96
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,390
Laced cigarettes. What's the additive?

97
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,390
Spec found codeine-based cough syrup
in her blood,and trace levels of nicotine.

98
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,110
How fast the city changes. GHB is dead as disco,

99
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,780
and fry sticks are the new date rape drug of New York City.

100
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,080
Three puffs--down goes Frazier.

101
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,490
Doesn't make any sense.

102
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,080
Rape kit came back negative.

103
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Why give someone a date rape drug and not rape?

104
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,210
Detective Taylor.

105
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,700
Similar neck contusions as the first woman.

106
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,490
Murdered by the same hands?

107
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,580
One way to find out.

108
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,590
We got a serial.

109
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,300
There's reason to believe we have
a serial dumping bodies all
over the city.

110
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,010
Trucks come in, they dump,
and they head back out.

111
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,980
So it's our job to sift and isolate
garbage from evidence.

112
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,690
What's the dimensions on the barge?

113
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,690
About 140 by 38 feet.

114
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,610
Half the size of a football field.

115
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,980
My kit's fully stocked.

116
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,280
Bring it.

117
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,780
Stella and I'll beat the M.E.'s.

118
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,490
You guys aren't sticking around?

119
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,780
We're bucking time here, Danny.

120
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,490
Sooner we draw parallels to
our victims, the fewer bodies
we're gonna find. So focus.

121
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,910
Déjà vu in some ways.

122
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,920
Different in some others.

123
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,290
Differences first.

124
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,290
No bed sores.

125
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,380
Cause of death?

126
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,880
Asphyxiation due to strangulation.

127
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,220
After death is where it got nasty.

128
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,010
He broke her neck.

129
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,300
Postmortem.

130
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,180
He's getting more aggressive.

131
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,890
- Similarities?
- Plenty.

132
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,400
Time of death on both women
was around the same time.
Both were putrefied.

133
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,400
Rape kit was negative.
Lividity slats.
And, of course, neck contusions...

134
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,990
Centering around the occipital artery.
Internal, common and external
carotid arteries,

135
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,580
as well as the Vagus nerve.

136
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,290
All arteries to the brain.

137
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,580
What was he doing?

138
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,000
Depriving her of oxygen?

139
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,290
That... or blood flow to the brain.

140
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,880
I was about to x-ray her teeth, until I saw this.

141
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,590
Russian.

142
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:25,010
It's gold mixed with heavy copper
impurities. I saw this type of
dentistry when I was in the marines.

143
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,810
During cold-weather training
in Scandinavia, there were a lot
of Russian ex-pats with this type
of work done.

144
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,400
Russian descent. Certainly narrows my choices.

145
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,980
Do me a favor, Hawkes, will you?

146
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,610
Write those arteries down for me.

147
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,280
Dr. Giles.

148
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,580
You know what they say about men who study too much data.

149
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,990
They become a statistic?

150
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,000
Something like that.

151
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,410
Listen, do you still have that medical bust?

152
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,790
Skinless or boneless?

153
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,580
Skinless.

154
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,500
Jackpot, Danny. I found a purse.

155
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,290
Unzipped. There's nothing inside.

156
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,380
Check this out.

157
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,210
Camera.

158
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,720
Still on.

159
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,590
The back hatch is broken.

160
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,390
Maybe somebody tried to rip the film out.

161
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,190
Okay, so whoever ripped...
tried to rip the film out didn't
destroy every frame.

162
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,110
Black-and-white film.

163
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,980
Do you see red?

164
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,280
No.

165
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,410
Wait, something's coming.

166
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,210
Where's the autopsy pic of
the Russian girl?

167
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,980
That's her.

168
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,900
They really get around, these two, huh?

169
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:23,900
Empire State Building, Rockefeller
Center, the zoo, the Met...

170
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,700
and...

171
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,990
Yeah, where was this taken?

172
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,490
Mr. and Mrs. Ivanov, we're
very sorry about your loss.

173
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,110
Was Zoya Pavlova your daughter?

174
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,700
We were her sponsors.

175
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,990
She came over to America
by way of Moscow to be a student.

176
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,210
It says in her missing persons
report that you waited four days
before reporting her missing.

177
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,380
Zoya has done this kind of thing before.

178
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,290
The second she comes to America, she goes crazy.

179
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,880
She's always with that American boyfriend.

180
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,880
Disappears three, four days at a time.

181
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,510
She doesn't tell us what she does,
where she goes.

182
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,390
Bogdhan, think of the girl.

183
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,980
Is this her boyfriend in the picture?

184
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:39,980
Yes.

185
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,610
We found these pictures in a
camera where Zoya was discovered.

186
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,110
The first four are of her and her boyfriend
in front of various tourist spots.

187
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,700
What's puzzling us is this photograph here.

188
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,410
Is this the boyfriend's residence?

189
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,490
We have never seen his house.

190
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Do you know his name?

191
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,210
We only know him as Jason.

192
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,210
He sells stuff on the streets.

193
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,880
Street vendor? Where?

194
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:10,880
Hey!

195
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,180
You got a peddler's license?

196
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:13,800
Yeah.

197
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Yeah? What's your name?

198
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,310
Jason Parnell. Why?

199
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,310
Hey, how you doin'?

200
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,680
You want glasses and whatnot?
There's one on every corner.

201
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,810
Cart's closed.

202
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,980
Jason Parnell?

203
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,690
I'm Detective Taylor.

204
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,610
This is Detective Bonasera from Crime Scene.

205
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,770
Do you recognize this woman?

206
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,690
Yeah, that's my girlfriend.

207
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,610
That's Zoya.

208
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,400
- Why, did you guys find her?
- She's dead.

209
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,110
When was the last time you saw her?

210
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,290
Hey. When was the last time you saw her?

211
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,410
I don't know, four, five days ago.

212
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,580
We went sightseeing.

213
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:47,090
We were supposed to hook up at Coney Island,
the boardwalk that night, but she never showed up.
She never returned my phone calls, so...

214
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,380
I just figured she wanted out.

215
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,090
I didn't know her that long.

216
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,380
But she's... she's dead?

217
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,800
Damn.

218
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,680
How?

219
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,600
Recognize these pictures, Jason?

220
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,100
Yeah. Yeah, that's us.

221
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,600
This is the Empire State Building.
That's the museum.
This is... that's the Bronx Zoo.

222
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,810
That was a funny day.

223
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,400
The baboons pick their asses right in front of you.

224
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,480
How about this picture, Jason?

225
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,110
You recognize this residence?

226
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,110
No.

227
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,910
No?

228
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,490
Then who's she blowing the kiss to?

229
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,200
I don't know ; it wasn't me.

230
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,990
I never saw that house in my life.
I swear on my grandmother.

231
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,410
Let me arrest him for swearing on
his grandmother.

232
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,080
You're coming with us.

233
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,710
Well, what about my stuff?

234
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,090
Forget about your stuff.
You're good to go. Let's go.

235
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,510
Trying to find a single house
in a city of eight million.

236
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,590
This should be fun.

237
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,300
All we need is a photograph.

238
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,980
All right, let's get
this triangulation started.

239
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,810
We'll use Zoya as our primary reference.
What's her height?

240
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,480
Uh, M.E. says she's five-nine.

241
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,690
Okay.

242
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,610
Secondary object,far left.

243
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,780
Isolate the needle on the Chrysler Building.

244
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,790
1,026 feet tall, including the needle.

245
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
Tertiary object, far right.

246
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,710
The slant on the Citicorp Building.

247
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,720
915 feet.

248
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,180
We've got our three reference points.

249
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,180
How far are the buildings from Zoya?

250
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,510
We'll know in a sec-- right down to her front door.

251
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,480
Circling and isolating.

252
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,600
Queens.

253
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,980
Long Island City.

254
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,300
Listen. You hear that?

255
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:56,800
Yeah.

256
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,800
Where's it coming from?

257
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,180
Hello?

258
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,490
She's alive.

259
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,280
Listen up.

260
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,580
We have two dead women and one still alive.
We divide and conquer.

261
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,080
Detective Flack, you find
the owner of this residence.

262
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,420
Put out a "wanted" message.

263
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,580
All five boroughs. Consider it done.

264
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,880
Danny, process the bedrooms.
Aiden, join him.

265
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,590
Okay.

266
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,590
Stella, process the basement, will you?
Medical equipment...

267
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:18,880
Where are you going?

268
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,090
Angel of Mercy Hospital.

269
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,880
The victim's priority. She's alive.

270
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,800
She may be the only person
who's seen the suspect.
I have to process her.

271
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,600
Mac.

272
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:27,890
You all right?

273
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,600
Yes. Why?

274
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,980
You've been working yourself to the ground.
When was the last time you slept?

275
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,610
I'll rest my head when I tire.

276
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,280
What?

277
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,400
What is it?
Did the husband get to you?

278
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,410
I'll be at Angel of Mercy.

279
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:55,290
No pictures.
No personal effects.

280
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,710
Not a partial. Nothing.

281
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,300
What's this guy live in gloves?

282
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,590
I'm getting all kinds of love over here.

283
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,300
I think he got tipped off.

284
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,890
I think he got off.

285
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,390
I thought sex wasn't part of
the deal with these women?

286
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,600
It's not.

287
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:14,600
I'll have Giles type it and run it through CODIS.

288
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,190
Maybe he can tell who's beneath the sheets.

289
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,400
She is alive, barely.

290
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,690
She's in a deep coma.

291
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,610
What's her condition?

292
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,200
Critical but stable.

293
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,490
How deep of a coma?

294
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,910
We're still evaluating her.

295
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,080
She's not responding to painful stimuli.

296
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,910
We're running a CAT scan to look for a cause.

297
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,380
You have no objection if I process her?

298
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,980
I'm Detective Mac Taylor.

299
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,990
I'm a crime scene investigator.

300
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,990
I'm here to help you.

301
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:13,000
First, I'd like to photograph any signs of trauma you may have suffered,

302
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
scrape under your fingernails,

303
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
take your fingerprints,

304
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
see if we can't find out who you are.

305
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,010
Nurse, could you assist me, please?

306
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,010
I need to photograph her neck.

307
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,990
Uh, could you, uh...turn her head please?

308
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:53,010
Ma'am, I... apologize

309
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:55,390
if I've done anything to make you feel uncomfortable.

310
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:15,410
A half-dead woman was found  in your rental home.

311
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,410
How is it you can't tell me who you rented it to?

312
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,420
I told you, the management company handles all that.

313
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,380
I heard that part already...

314
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,380
too much in one interrogation, as it turns out.

315
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,390
What this mother's face isn't buying is...

316
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,390
how HIDTA, the entire NYPD...

317
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:45,400
me... can't seem to find a single transaction that you rented the house to a real person.

318
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,400
Hey, mind if I swab him, Flack?

319
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,400
Be my guest.

320
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,990
You won't have any problem getting his mouth open. He don't shut up.

321
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,990
I'd like to take a buccal swab for a DNA sample. It'll only take a second.

322
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,000
Open up...Sir, open up your mouth, please. Sir!

323
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,000
Open up, Mr. Silo.You like things with soft tips in your mouth am I right?

324
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,000
Hey, that's harassment.

325
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,010
Thank you.

326
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,010
Hoops on Saturday, Flack. Don't forget.

327
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,970
Where were we?

328
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,980
Dr. Giles, what do you think?

329
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,980
It didn't feel random?

330
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,980
The blinking? No, no, it didn't.

331
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,990
Almost felt as if she was trying to communicate, but she couldn't

332
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:36,990
It's probable.

333
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,990
What do you mean?

334
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,990
Locked-In Syndrome. I think I know what this is.

335
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:47,000
think your Angel of Mercy victim may be the victim of a perverted science experiment,

336
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
no doubt by someone with an acute medical acumen.

337
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,010
Locked-In Syndrome?

338
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,010
A rare neurological disorder characterized by complete paralysis

339
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:58,010
of all voluntary muscles in the body with the exception of the eyes.

340
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:02,980
In essence, she's "locked inside" her own body, yet her mind is fully sound.

341
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,980
Ca-Can she unlock?

342
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,980
Snap out of it?

343
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,990
Afraid not--the condition is irreversible.

344
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,990
How is he intentionally "locking" them in?

345
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,990
Skillfully. I'd imagine first, he'd have to sedate the subject,

346
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:26,000
put them in a docile state in order to locate specific arterial pressure points.

347
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,010
He wasn't getting more violent. He was perfecting his maneuver.

348
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,980
LeAnn Goodman was found...

349
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,980
first, but she had bedsores.

350
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,990
The Russian woman we found second, died first.

351
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,990
She had no bed sores. She died quickly.

352
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,000
This means we found the bodies out of order.

353
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Our first two victims were failures.

354
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:20,010
Our Angel of Mercy victim was a success. She was kept.

355
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,980
so...

356
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,980
now what, Dr. Giles?

357
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,990
She's seen the killer... and she can't talk.

358
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,990
It's Mac Taylor.

359
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
We ran your prints through our Missing Persons database,

360
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
but we haven't been able to I.D. you as yet.

361
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,010
Ma'am...

362
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,010
I know you can hear me.

363
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:07,020
I want to find the person who did this to you.

364
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,980
I'm going to ask you some questions. I realize you cannot speak, but...

365
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,980
I want you to answer by blinking your eyes.

366
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,990
I'd like you to blink twice for "yes" and once for "no"

367
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,990
Do you understand?

368
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,010
Were you answering yes?

369
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,010
I'm going to show you some pictures.

370
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,020
The first is a woman named...

371
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,980
LeAnn Goodman.

372
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,980
Do you know her?

373
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,990
This is her husband, Tim Goodman.

374
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,990
Did he do this to you?

375
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,000
Zoya Pavlova.

376
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
She's a Russian woman out of Coney Island. Do you know her?

377
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,010
Okay, this is her boyfriend, Jason Parnell. Did he do this to you?

378
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:30,970
The home we found you in belongs to this man.

379
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,980
Nurse!

380
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,990
I need a doctor in he! Nurse!

381
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:57,000
Detective Taylor? She suffered a severe stroke. We've run some preliminary tests.

382
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm afraid she has a Glasgow Coma Score of three.

383
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
What are you saying, she's brain dead?

384
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,010
I'm afraid so.

385
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,980
hey...

386
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,980
its me...

387
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,980
...it's Detective Taylor.

388
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,990
Can you hear me?

389
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,990
It's Mac Taylor.

390
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,000
Can you hear me?

391
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,990
Mac?

392
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,990
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but the DNA on the semen from the bed
sheets came back.

393
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,990
No match on the boyfriend or the home owner.

394
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
That only proves they didn't have sex with her.

395
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It doesn't exonerate them of murder.

396
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Danny and Aiden lit that place up like a Christmas tree.

397
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
They couldn't find so much as a partial.

398
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,010
I talked to the victim. She implicated the home owner.

399
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,010
You talked to the victim?

400
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,980
I thought maybe she was blinking because...

401
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:57,000
It's a temporary setback. We keep working, right?

402
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
why?

403
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
what

404
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Why, Stella? Why does he do it?

405
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:11,010
What's the connection? Why does he lock women inside their own bodies?

406
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,020
Talk out the nature of the crime with me.

407
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,980
What is it

408
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,980
in its very nature?

409
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,980
It's diabolical.

410
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,980
It's calculated.

411
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,990
It's personal.

412
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,990
It's intimate.

413
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,990
He removed himself from the house.

414
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
If that's true, we interrupted his cover-up. Left us a live witness.

415
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
He's saving her for some reason.

416
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,010
He removed himself from the house,

417
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,010
but the question is, did he remove himself from her?

418
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,010
What about the medical equipment?

419
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:57,010
We superglued and dusted. There's no detectable print.

420
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:01,980
Oh, th-this killer's in cover-up mode. He's way too smart for superglue or-or powders. We need...

421
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,980
We need further enhancement. Let's spray it with rodamine. Hit it with a laser.

422
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,980
- Go back in.
- yeah

423
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,990
- What kind of letters are those?
- Cyrillic.

424
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,990
They look like initials.

425
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,000
They are. "B, I."

426
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Russian.

427
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Bogdhan Ivanov.

428
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,980
Bogdhan Ivanov.

429
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,980
Says here you were a medical doctor in the Soviet Union.

430
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,990
Did a stint in prison under Brezhnev for treason in '81.

431
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,990
Released and later fled to America.

432
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,000
We got a match from your reference sample

433
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
to the DNA mixture pulled from the bed sheets in your rental house.

434
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
It also contained Zoya's DNA.

435
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,800
yes

436
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,010
Zoya and I made love in that bed many times.

437
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,010
You loved her?

438
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,010
Very much.

439
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,020
Did you take this picture, sir?

440
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,980
no

441
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,980
I wouldn't have taken you for a man in denial, Mr. Ivanov.

442
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,980
Doctor Ivanov.

443
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,980
You're not a doctor. You're a murderer

444
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,990
with a medical degree.

445
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,990
Why don't I start the story for you...

446
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,990
doctor

447
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:27,000
You killed Zoya trying to lock her inside her own body.

448
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,010
You're a taxi driver.

449
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,010
Is that how you picked up your victims?

450
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:51,980
Why?

451
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,980
Why lock them in?

452
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:02,990
You know what name "Bogdhan" means in Russia?

453
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,000
Gift from God.

454
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Zoya came to me.

455
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,010
She was the one who wanted to be taken care of by me.

456
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:22,010
Feed her, bathe her, read her literature,

457
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,010
play music.

458
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,980
She wanted to be free from the burden of daily life.

459
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,980
Achieve a cerebral utopia.

460
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:39,990
Live inside dreams with her mind wandering without disturbances.

461
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,990
Give her the gift of freedom.

462
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,990
That was the plan.

463
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:45,990
That was the pact.

464
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:49,000
I think when Zoya asked you to take care of her,

465
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
paralyzing her from the eyes down wasn't what she had in mind,

466
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
was it, Doctor?

467
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
This wasn't about freedom.

468
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,010
Or Zoya.

469
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,010
Or some gift from God.

470
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,010
This was about control.

471
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:09,980
The second we darkened your door, you lost control.

472
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,980
And you removed yourself from your house, but you left the woman.

473
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,990
After all, she was still alive.

474
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,990
You couldn't pull the plug, could you, Doctor?

475
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,990
It finally worked.

476
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Those women died for the same reason you got caught.

477
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
You didn't know when to let go.

478
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,980
I'm so tired.

479
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,990
You know I used to sit like this with my wife.

480
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,000
Her name was Claire.

481
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
She died, uh, on 9/11.

482
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,010
Nobody saw it coming.

483
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,020
I was cleaning out that closet the other day and, uh...

484
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,980
I found this beach ball.

485
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,990
And I remembered...

486
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,990
it was my wife who blew it up

487
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,000
I never told anybody this, but, uh,

488
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I got rid of everything that reminded me of Claire.

489
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,010
