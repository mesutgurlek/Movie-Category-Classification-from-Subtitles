1
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,980
For a long time I've been walking
down life's road with my two pals...

2
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,858
...bad luck and bad choices.

3
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,486
Fortunately, I'm a big believer
in new beginnings, new friends...

4
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,864
...and running from my problems.

5
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,033
So one day I decided to head
for the Islands.

6
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,203
Aloha. My name is Jack.

7
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,752
Start here. All the way down the line.

8
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,504
Rolling.

9
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:39,224
Ain't gonna get no work done today with
these Menehune huggers blocking the site.

10
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,939
Mr. Ritchie's gonna take care
of these assholes, chop-chop.

11
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,570
I've got a hotel to build. I don't care how
many Hawaiians got their blood spilled here.

12
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:55,532
If they so much as scratch
Mr. Ritchie's car when he shows, he'll shit.

13
00:01:55,699 --> 00:02:00,412
Yeah, I'll get up there. Now, take it easy
on me because I got a bad shoulder here.

14
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,956
-Serve me one up.
-What are you doing?

15
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,292
-I'll smack one down Frank's throat.
-No.

16
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,753
-I'm gonna hit one.
-Put your tool belt on.

17
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,297
Harris, ease up.
We're just having some fun.

18
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,175
Yeah, Frank, you get back to work.

19
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,094
Now!

20
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,889
What? Just like that? No more game?

21
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,893
You'll go back to desecrating
these people's land, blowing up palm trees?

22
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,146
We can go blow up palm trees later.
I just want one pitch.

23
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,191
Come on, I think it's messing
with our karma.

24
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:33,779
-I need the work.
-Yeah, you do.

25
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:38,659
-Come on, Frank, be part of us.
-Hey, you shut up, coconut nigger.

26
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:43,914
Did he just say "coconut nigger"? Harris,
Harris, Harris, you can't say coconut nigger.

27
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,917
-Oh, I can't?
-Well, not really in this day and age.

28
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,294
-You're fired.
-Why?

29
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:53,215
-Get off the premises.
-These aren't your premises. This is..

30
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,301
-Are you joking?
-I'm gonna kick your ass.

31
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,137
-Kick my ass? This is a bat.
-It's just aluminum.

32
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,931
-Just a wimp.
-Threatening me?

33
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,351
No, but I'll hit you because
you're really big and crazy...

34
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,396
...and you're scaring me right now.
I'm gonna hit you.

35
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,151
That dislocated the jaw.

36
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,697
Walter, let me read you
Mr. Harris' statement.

37
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:21,535
"l found Jack and some others playing
ball. I politely asked them to stop...

38
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,705
...as Mr. Ritchie would not be happy
with this situation.

39
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:29,793
I told Jack he was under my supervision
When he told me to do an unprintable thing.

40
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:34,715
So I told him to put the bat down, but he
came at me before I could defend myself."

41
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,466
And got fungoed.

42
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:41,180
-So, what do you think, judge?
-Good, quick hands.

43
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,474
He's also got an interesting rap sheet.

44
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:49,188
Got a couple of breaking and enterings,
no convictions.

45
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:53,775
He's got a bunco rap here. Suspected of
conning a police officer out of some money.

46
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:58,155
-They always wind up here, don't they?
-Hawaii is sort of the end of the line.

47
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,240
They never seem to go on to Tokyo.

48
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,744
We ought to put him in jail,
let him work on his swing a bit.

49
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,746
Let's just keep an eye on him.

50
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:09,708
He did manage to shut down
Ray Ritchie's construction site for a bit.

51
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,502
Standup guy in my book.

52
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,339
I hope you enjoyed your stay with us.

53
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:19,343
Just sign that at the bottom.
Your company was kind enough to dropped off your paycheck...

54
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,222
...which ought to be a good head start
in getting you off the island.

55
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,851
I had a harp, a harmonica.

56
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,686
Neither one.

57
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,939
A Hohner. You didn't see..?

58
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,067
Why would anyone want
a prisoner's used harmonica?

59
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,612
Would you like to look back
in your cell for 30 more days for it?

60
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,447
No, I wouldn't.

61
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,908
You can pick a new one
up at waialua--

62
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:47,579
Why don't you buy one in Honolulu, sport.
I'll put you on the Pearl Shuttle today.

63
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,582
That's all right. I'll see you.

64
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,334
Better not.

65
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,143
Now what?

66
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,647
You don't work for me anymore,
so I don't have to help you out.

67
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,440
Fair enough.

68
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,985
I will tell you something
for your own good.

69
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,445
Go back to the mainland.

70
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:25,534
What, miss the big surf season?
Are you crazy? I live for these big waves.

71
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:29,121
You club a foreman in front of his men,
someone will knife you...

72
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,373
...so fast you won't even feel it.

73
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,127
Well, I got a long walk ahead of me.
Thanks for the tip, Bob Jr.

74
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,628
I'll be seeing you around.

75
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:40,090
Jack, Mr. Ritchie got you out
because we got a hotel to build.

76
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,302
And it won't get built with
all the workers in courtrooms.

77
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:49,016
The quicker you shut up, the quicker
I'm gone. I got a long walk ahead of me.

78
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,186
And then you're out of here?

79
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,564
-I'm gone.
-I'll give you a ride to your truck.

80
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,525
Now you're talking.
You'd have been a big hit in jail.

81
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,068
-Don't touch me.
-Seriously.

82
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,551
Nancy.

83
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,681
Come on, I got a lot to do today.

84
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,604
What do you want me to do when
your wife comes back from Honolulu?

85
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,022
You go to the lodge.

86
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,651
What, slip out the back door
as she comes in the front? Like this?

87
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,361
I'll be back next Thursday.

88
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:47,282
If you don't like this, Bob Jr. can drive you
past Cane Haul Road, where you came from.

89
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,953
Well, it's nice to know
you can't live without me, Ray.

90
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,747
Did I make any promises to you?

91
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,708
We're clear?
Do I owe you anything?

92
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,169
Ray Ritchie, always the businessman.

93
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,257
You're a cute kid, Nancy.

94
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,885
If I had to replace you,
it'd probably take me most of the day.

95
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,267
Think I don't know
you're up to something?

96
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,561
Who are you fooling with?

97
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,021
You, Ray.

98
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:23,235
Get dressed. You're coming with me.
Hurry up, get your skinny ass moving.

99
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,654
Come on, I don't have all day.

100
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,714
-Hey, there he is!
-Yeah, he's our brother!

101
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,090
Show them, man.

102
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,550
Give the man a bat.

103
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,969
Brother, you the man.

104
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,065
Yeah.

105
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,322
You missed a spot. Beat it, Frank.

106
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,536
I'm taking The Alison out for a cruise.
We'll moor it in Lanikuhonua.

107
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,748
-Then I'm heading to Honolulu.
-Excellent.

108
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,292
-ls that him?
-Yes, sir.

109
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,920
-He's been arrested before, huh?
-A few times.

110
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:27,007
-What for?
-Various scams. B and E, mostly.

111
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,176
What's "B and E"?

112
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,470
Breaking and entering.

113
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,722
That ought to turn you on.

114
00:08:56,662 --> 00:09:00,207
Mr. Ritchie, you want to get rid of me
bad enough to give me a lift?

115
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,209
Sure, cowboy.

116
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,838
But not bad enough to drive
with you to Honolulu.

117
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,923
Mahalo, anyway.

118
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,915
-Dude, wait till I tell you what I found.
-No, pass.

119
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,878
-What do you mean? I didn't say anything.
-I'm semi-retired.

120
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,548
-I know what you're gonna say.
-No. What you are is out of a job.

121
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:53,760
This is the place I've been telling you
about, and I can't do it without you.

122
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:59,183
Let me explain it simply. I just did a short
visit to jail. That's enough for a while.

123
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:03,604
-lt was a pain in the ass. I'm taking a break.
-I've been casing this all summer.

124
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,399
Don't make me waste that work.
One quick look, that's all I'm asking.

125
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,234
We're talking about a fat goose.

126
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,237
Hear what I'm saying?
You're looking at the new me.

127
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,072
Come on. Come take a look.

128
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,910
-You still owe Harris money?
-I don't wanna talk about that.

129
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,913
I'm gonna take one look.
Would you do it for me?

130
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,540
-I would do it for you.
-Okay.

131
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:27,503
-Okay. One look. One look.
-Beautiful.

132
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,138
-What do you think?
-How many we got?

133
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,974
I count 20 cars,
but they're all down at the beach.

134
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,228
Okay. You wait here.

135
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,439
-Yes.
-Anybody comes, you still wait here.

136
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:51,777
-Oh, what if, like, the cops come by?
-Just watch them roll by. Are you nervous?

137
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:56,281
-Are you having second thoughts?
-I just wanna make sure I'm doing it right.

138
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,618
-Everything's cool.
-Who's ever sure if it's cool?

139
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,620
Let me just open..

140
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:06,124
Bad start here.
Getting a little sloppy here.

141
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:10,295
What are we doing?
We're just delivering beer.

142
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:13,966
No crime in that. Not yet, at least.
They haven't outlawed that.

143
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,239
Hello.

144
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,867
You guys order some beer?

145
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,762
Hey.

146
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,432
Hi. Aloha. I'm wendy
with the Haleiwa Party Planners.

147
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:50,229
-Yeah, we thought you'd never make it.
-I know. We're just swamped today. Sorry.

148
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:53,941
-You're a mermaid.
-Yeah, you ordered the Catch of the Day.

149
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,109
Yeah, yeah. We made the right choice.

150
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,946
-Flippers and all. Wow.
-Great.

151
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,616
-I'll turn you loose there in the kitchen.
-Okay.

152
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:06,787
Your flippers clean? Just the floors.
We had to give a cleaning deposit.

153
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,705
-Okay.
-They look all right.

154
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,000
-That little shimmering stuff looks good.
-Thanks.

155
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:22,052
-Give it to me. Give it to me.
-Hold it, hold it, get over here.

156
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,137
Give me my cut.

157
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,640
You're gonna be happy With this one.

158
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,600
-What is this?
-What's what?

159
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,145
-Dude, this is 200. You said we made six.
-Yeah, right.

160
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:36,567
Yeah, but 200 is your cut.
That's the going rate for hiding in the truck.

161
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:40,445
Come on, I'm 1 5 in the hole to Harris.
I wasn't hiding in the truck.

162
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:44,992
-I'm not a rich man.
-Jack, please.

163
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,288
-Thanks.
-Hold it.

164
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,123
Take the wallets and the box...

165
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,710
...go get rid of them behind
Kammie's Market, in the dumpsters.

166
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,962
Absolutely.
We should do this again soon.

167
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,701
You know, they got a video
of you batting Harris?

168
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,912
-ls that right?
-Yeah.

169
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,830
How did you happen to see it?

170
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,335
Well, if Harris hadn't dropped the charges,
the trial would've been in my court.

171
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:38,337
I'm the D.J. here.

172
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,173
District judge, among other things.

173
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:45,010
I'm glad you sat down. Let me ask you,
if they dropped the charges...

174
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:48,931
-...how come they're telling me to leave?
-Can't make you leave...

175
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,183
...unless they make something up.

176
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,685
There we are. Thank you.

177
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,357
What's this for?

178
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:02,486
Chamber of commerce, welcome wagon.

179
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:09,368
Now, for what it's worth, kid, I think
you're better off out from under Ray Ritchie.

180
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:13,539
-You're not a fan of Ray Ritchie's?
-Don't like the way he does things.

181
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:17,251
See, he's supposed to be in Chapter 1 1.

182
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,630
Any businessman knows, if you're bankrupt,
you can't afford to build that hotel.

183
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,590
Are you a businessman?

184
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,760
I got a little resort spot.

185
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,804
Surf camp.

186
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:32,724
I guess Ray's big, ugly hotel
Wouldn't be so great for your business.

187
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:36,770
No, not at all.
It's just the way he treats us locals.

188
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:39,857
You got a bunch of little cabins
over near the beach?

189
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,359
Keiki Vista? Shit.

190
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:44,736
-I've got 1 2 bungalows, my man.
-Bungalows?

191
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:49,908
Bungalows. Bedroom, kitchen, bath.
The whole works.

192
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,077
You wanna see a pretty girl?

193
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,751
She's practically undressing me
with her eyes there.

194
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,130
Do you know that guy she's sitting with?

195
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:08,927
Bob Jr.? He's Ray Ritchie's flunky.
His old man and I play dominoes together.

196
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,929
What's that girl's name?

197
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,265
Nancy-something.

198
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,727
She's Ray's assistant.
But that's a euphemism.

199
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:19,563
Kind of young to be a euphemism,
isn't she?

200
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,774
Word of warning.
She's been in my court a couple of times.

201
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,860
-This girl?
-Started young.

202
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:26,486
Looks so sWeet.

203
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:31,158
Yeah. One of those unfortunate girls
who's turned on by the criminal type.

204
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,993
Poor girl.

205
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:36,038
I wonder what she's doing
with Bob Jr.

206
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:42,669
Bob's old man, dumb-shit,
undersold all of his property to Ray Ritchie.

207
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,506
Don't look now,
but Dumbshit Jr.'s coming over.

208
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,971
-Bob.
-Are you trying to be cute?

209
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,974
Now, Junior, who can be cute
with you around?

210
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:59,478
-This is company business, Walter.
-Does he Work for you?

211
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,939
No. We paid him off,
and he agreed to leave.

212
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,316
You paid him off because you owed him.

213
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:07,611
Now he doesn't work for you anymore.
Right? Right.

214
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:11,698
So if he doesn't want to go anywhere,
he doesn't have to. Right? Right.

215
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:15,035
-Right.
-You letting him fight your battles for you?

216
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:18,664
Yeah. Seems to be doing a good job.

217
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,666
Right.

218
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:25,963
If I wasn't with someone I might just pick
your ass up and carry you out of here.

219
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:29,842
You might have to if Walter keeps buying
me beer. I'm all liquored up.

220
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:32,177
I'm just trying to keep my wits about me.

221
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:36,306
Look, Junior, I invited this guy
to have a beer, and we're not done.

222
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:41,353
We might have another one or 1 0 more. The
point is, you said what you came to say.

223
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,397
So now why don't you just leave.

224
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,571
I get the feeling we're gonna run
into each other again.

225
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:53,824
And one of us is gonna end up
looking like shit.

226
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:59,329
I got a head start on you
in that department. It's not fair.

227
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,336
Your Honor.

228
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:11,508
-Bob Jr. scare you?
-Yeah, he does.

229
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,344
Not as much as that girl, though.

230
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,347
Thank you, there.

231
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:19,433
Appreciate that.

232
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,979
-You gonna be hanging around here?
-I don't know yet.

233
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,732
Want to come to work at Keiki Vista?

234
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,651
I'll pay you $250.. No.

235
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,069
I'll pay you...

236
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:35,741
...$300 a week and give you a place to
stay that you can fix up. You think it over.

237
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:50,255
-Hey.
-Hey, yourself.

238
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:10,317
Hi, I'm Number 9.

239
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:13,946
I have a weird showerhead
that just keeps spraying everywhere.

240
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,822
-Think you can fix it?
-Sure.

241
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:19,201
I just wanna finish what I started here,
then I'll get on it.

242
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,620
-Thanks.
-Thanks, Number 9.

243
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,964
I want you to check the showerhead
in Number 9.

244
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,759
I just spoke with her.
So I guess I'm the plumber also.

245
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:38,971
And the cook and the lifeguard
before I'm through with you.

246
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,973
Does Ray Ritchie live around here?

247
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:45,394
You mean, does Nancy live around here?

248
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:50,315
That pimp starter castle up the beach.

249
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:06,725
Okay, call me when you get there.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

250
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,900
That's great.

251
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:19,947
Well, same to you.

252
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,867
Oh, really?

253
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,956
Yeah. I was just on the phone with him.

254
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:40,175
Yeah, he's kind of interesting
in sort of a limited way, for an off night.

255
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:43,929
Listen, I have to run.
My personal trainer just showed up.

256
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:45,764
Mahalo.

257
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:49,142
Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you
like that.

258
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:52,145
You are good at this B and E thing,
aren't you?

259
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,356
It's more trespassing at this point.

260
00:21:54,523 --> 00:21:58,485
So should I call the police now,
or you gonna tie me up and loot the place?

261
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:00,112
Call the cops?

262
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,657
You go to this trouble to get me here,
and now you call the cops?

263
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,742
A word of advice.

264
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,829
If you're thinking of scamming Ray Ritchie,
think twice.

265
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:12,165
Who said anything about scamming?
I came to see if you wanted to surf.

266
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:15,252
-You, downstairs.
-Let me ask you...

267
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,590
-...why were you winking at me in the bar?
-I wasn't winking at you at the bar.

268
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,050
Like hell, you didn't.

269
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:26,972
-You get scared being here all alone?
-I'm never all alone.

270
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:30,976
So beautiful.

271
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:35,480
-This looks like a good one.
-No, not that one. It's too stimulating.

272
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:38,317
-Let's do something else.
-Like what?

273
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:42,821
Let's do something
that makes the sex better afterwards.

274
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:46,825
Sometimes sex makes the sex
better afterwards. I'm old-fashioned.

275
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:52,915
I don't know what you'd be interested in.
I'm the poor, unfortunate criminal type.

276
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:56,627
-Yeah, you look dangerous.
-Kind of an outlaw.

277
00:22:56,793 --> 00:23:00,380
You know, I get into things
like stealing cars and....

278
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:01,840
You know how?

279
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,053
-Please. You wouldn't be interested in that..
-I'll make you a deal.

280
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,891
Why don't you show me how, and I'll
show you something, whatever you want.

281
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:13,060
Like how to make bail?

282
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:22,110
I'm starting to get a little nervous.
Is Ray a great boxer or something?

283
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:23,904
Take your shoes off.

284
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,949
Watch your head.

285
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:30,744
-Don't be scared.
-This is like a..

286
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,373
Are you serious?
You really want to box?

287
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,834
I win, you show me how to steal a car.

288
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,629
You win, I do Whatever you want.

289
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:44,216
-Put them up.
-Did you grow up on a Marine base?

290
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:48,053
Just don't use the
" I've never hit a girl" excuse.

291
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,513
I've never hit a girl.

292
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:55,686
Don't be hitting me on my head
When I'm not looking.

293
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,105
You've just awakened a sleeping giant.

294
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:02,317
-Tell me everything about yourself.
-No, you first. I need to work on my D.

295
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:06,113
Okay. I dropped out of high school,
took a trip to Hollywood...

296
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,741
...went broke, came home
and hostessed at a strip club.

297
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:12,828
Everybody hostesses. Nobody strips.

298
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,790
-Too shy.
-Too shy?

299
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,918
I met Ray and figured him
for an easy mark and....

300
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:24,798
And I sort of liked him when I found out
he cheats on his taxes.

301
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:27,301
The arrangement works out fine.

302
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:29,511
And you?

303
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:32,139
You're not gonna believe it,
you told my story.

304
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:35,058
Too shy to strip, so I was a hostess too.

305
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,942
You hit me!

306
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:45,444
Is that allowed?

307
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:49,823
-"I've never hit a girl before."
-Come on, let's work on our clinches.

308
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,075
Let's go steal a car.

309
00:24:57,122 --> 00:25:00,375
You happy now? We did it. Stole a car.

310
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:04,254
-Easy.
-What do we do?

311
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:06,089
-Shit.
-Be cool.

312
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:10,010
-We're in a stolen car.
-True, but they don't know that.

313
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:12,888
-Hopefully.
-Hey, boys!

314
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,840
Nancy?

315
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:52,135
Nancy?

316
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:55,222
Nancy?

317
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,187
Okay, a little cat-and-mouse.
Well, I'll play the game.

318
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:05,774
-Nancy!
-Don't look. I'm taking my clothes off.

319
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:08,735
I get shy at the weirdest times.

320
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,917
It's my party dress.

321
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,294
Mine too.

322
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,924
So is this Mr. Ritchie's boat,
The Alison?

323
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:15,511
-Who's Alison?
-Take a wild guess.

324
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:20,891
Mrs. R. God, he must really love her
to name such a great boat after her.

325
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:23,936
Come here. Come sit down next to me.

326
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:32,986
So let's have it.

327
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:35,781
-Have what?
-Just ask me.

328
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:43,413
So ask me what you want to ask me.

329
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:47,584
Okay. Have you ever stolen any money?

330
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:51,755
I'll grab something if it's lying around.

331
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,299
What's the most you ever got?

332
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:57,970
-Couple hundred bucks.
-Okay.

333
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:02,182
What if I told you
there was 200,000 lying around?

334
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:06,353
-Would you have the nerve to take it?
-We talking about Ray Ritchie's money?

335
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,108
-Wouldn't that make it a little more fun?
-Where would this 200,000 be lying around?

336
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:15,153
In his hunting lodge,
up in the Waialua Hills.

337
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:19,366
-What's he got the money for?
-For the local gangsters.

338
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:23,954
He wants to make sure there are no more
protesters at the construction site.

339
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,123
-You following?
-Yeah, I follow you.

340
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:30,002
-How do you know all this?
-Bob Jr. told me.

341
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:34,882
-And the money just sits there?
-Bob Jr. will be with it.

342
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:36,675
We'll find a way to grab it.

343
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:39,720
Two hundred grand's a lot different
from a TV set.

344
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:41,513
Yeah, it's way lighter.

345
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:44,057
I'll take a look at the lodge.

346
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:46,185
Let's have a drink.

347
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:51,273
You gotta admit this is a great boat.
I mean, even if it is called The Alison.

348
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,401
Wait till you see the one
they name after me.

349
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:05,871
And I guess now we call it a night.

350
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,789
That was fun. I had a good time.

351
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:10,042
-Me too.
-Yeah.

352
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,960
-I'll be seeing you.
-Wait, Nancy.

353
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:15,756
I mean, you wanna have a nightcap?

354
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:22,012
-We could break into a house or something.
-Okay, yeah.

355
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:26,266
If you're sure the house is empty,
why are we whispering?

356
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,852
Professional courtesy.

357
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:32,064
-What's that?
-I don't know, a shrunken head?

358
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:34,566
God.

359
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:38,111
Get a room.

360
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:40,239
And a rubber!

361
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,971
-Oh, hey, Jack. How are you?
-Frank, what--?

362
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:08,433
-How'd you know I was here?
-The guy outside said this was yours.

363
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,480
-Did he tell you to make yourself at home?
-No, I tried the door and it was open.

364
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:16,942
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay. I've just had a crazy day.

365
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:21,613
Well, listen,
I hate to burden you with this, but....

366
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,575
-Can I get you anything?
-Harris has these guys...

367
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:27,953
...and they're gonna kick my ass
if I don't pay him his money.

368
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:32,207
-What do you want me to do? Pay him.
-Harris says I know where you're hiding.

369
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:37,004
First, I'm not really hiding. Second, you
Would never tell him where I was hiding...

370
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:40,132
-...because you're my friend.
-I'm not threatening you.

371
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:44,553
Things will get weird if it seems you're
threatening me and I'm threatening you.

372
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,265
Listen, I'm desperate for this money,
and we're friends, right?

373
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:53,061
Yeah, we're friends. But it's the type
of friendship where if you're in trouble...

374
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:57,858
...I probably won't be there for you just like
I wouldn't expect you to be there for me.

375
00:30:58,025 --> 00:31:02,821
It's a more honest friendship. It's not this
phony thing. It's like a genuine friendship.

376
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,742
I can't trust you. You can't trust me.
I'm not taking a bullet for you.

377
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:10,996
-I'm not gonna jump on a grenade for you.
-Jack, Jack, cut the shit, will you?

378
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:14,833
-How much do you owe Harris?
-Fifteen hundred.

379
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:17,252
Dollars? You think I got 1 500?

380
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:20,380
No, no, but you know
how to get that kind of money.

381
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:23,050
Okay.

382
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,220
I got one thing I'm working on.
Maybe I can work you in.

383
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:29,431
Yes, please. Thank you.
Thank you so much. Thanks.

384
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:31,558
Wait, you wanna tell me
about it now?

385
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:35,312
-I'm working out details. I'll surprise you.
-Thanks. Thanks, man.

386
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,412
Bravo!

387
00:31:54,873 --> 00:31:57,459
Hey, you went flying off there that time.

388
00:31:57,626 --> 00:32:00,462
-Mahalo.
-Very good dive.

389
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:04,174
-Appreciate that, Walter.
-Pretty high up there, isn't it?

390
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,176
Well, you ready to try it?

391
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:11,306
Me? No, I wanna give my food
a chance to settle before I get up there.

392
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:14,309
Oh, boy, look at that.

393
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:17,062
Figured out your day off?

394
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:20,691
Yeah, I was thinking about maybe Friday.

395
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:22,860
-No, I need you Friday.
-What?

396
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:25,696
-I've got a meeting.
-What do you got a meeting on?

397
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:29,908
None of your business.

398
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,913
So tomorrow's better than Friday?

399
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:37,875
Yeah.

400
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:42,462
So I hear you found a new friend.

401
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:45,757
You mean Nancy? No.

402
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,926
She belongs to Ray Ritchie.

403
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:52,514
-Well, I didn't think he'd given her to you.
-No, she's still Ritchie's.

404
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:56,059
As long as you remember.

405
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:59,271
Pretty girl, though.

406
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:14,661
This house, there's no newspaper out front,
Which makes me think that they're home.

407
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:16,580
Over at that house....

408
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:20,959
That house is definitely occupied.
Judging from the car, it's an elderly couple.

409
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:23,962
I get along really well
with my grandmother.

410
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:26,715
You do? Yeah, me too.
Okay, we'll skip that house.

411
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:30,844
Then off in the distance, we got
a little happy-hour get-together going on.

412
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:35,307
Obviously, we're gonna pass. So I think
we're gonna find an empty house.

413
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:37,184
Where's the rush?

414
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:54,535
What are you gonna say
if someone comes?

415
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:57,454
Are the Ambruzazaolas here?

416
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:59,873
What if that's their name?

417
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,625
-Ambruzazaola?
-Yes.

418
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:04,294
-What are the odds?
-Where's the bounce?

419
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:13,929
Here we go.

420
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:24,356
There. You getting a little bounce?

421
00:34:24,523 --> 00:34:26,275
A little.

422
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:29,111
Perfect.

423
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:33,866
-Are you scared?
-No.

424
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:37,244
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

425
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:56,430
-Guess if I have clothes on.
-The guy who lives here is a cop.

426
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:58,849
-I know. I know. Guess.
-I know the guy.

427
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:00,893
Guess.

428
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:03,395
-What is this?
-I don't know.

429
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:06,565
Son of a bitch, this is my harmonica.
That..

430
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:07,983
What?

431
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:13,113
Come here. Come here. Hurry.

432
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:16,783
Christ, I'm late.

433
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:22,039
Where'd you tear my shirt off last night?

434
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,961
It may be downstairs. Check, love.
I'm on duty in 1 0 minutes.

435
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,880
Yes, officer.

436
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:48,565
-Take that shirt off. Let's go.
-No way. I earned it.

437
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:50,484
-Take it off.
-No.

438
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:53,737
-Come on.
-"Yes, officer."

439
00:35:53,904 --> 00:35:55,781
-Not funny.
-Yes, it is.

440
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:58,367
Did you see that tattoo?

441
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:01,286
Mercy.

442
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:21,557
-Aloha, Jack.
-Hey, Number 9.

443
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:25,394
-I have to use your bathroom.
-I'm surprised you didn't use the cop's.

444
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:27,187
What if he'd seen us?

445
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:29,857
He would have seen his career
and reputation go.

446
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:32,818
Let me tell you.
He probably would've had to kill us.

447
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:36,196
There's a fine line between taking a risk
and being an idiot.

448
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:39,366
Maybe he's fine being gay.
Not everyone's in the closet.

449
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:41,660
What does that mean?

450
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:46,164
Hurry.

451
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,175
-What a freak-hole.
-What?

452
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:58,302
Jack, it's really depressing here.

453
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:01,346
-I'm depressed.
-This isn't depressing.

454
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:05,851
It's one of the things I like about it,
is how depressing it is.

455
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,895
It's like where dreams go to die.

456
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:14,234
You got me here.
Is there something you want to show me?

457
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:18,197
-Yeah.
-What?

458
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:27,539
-Come on.
-I'm spoken for.

459
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:29,499
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

460
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:33,378
-Let's go peek in windows. It'll be fun.
-Have a heart.

461
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:42,471
Does the party ever stop here?

462
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:47,100
How do you handle all the excitement,
one would wonder.

463
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:49,520
Lock it up. That's my boss.

464
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:51,897
What do we have here?

465
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:06,787
Walter is into some kinky shit.
Look at this.

466
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:09,498
He's a good guy.
He's just watching a dance show.

467
00:38:09,665 --> 00:38:13,919
If he's such a good guy,
don't you feel a little bad scamming him?

468
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:18,382
I'm not scamming him.
Look at me, I'm not scamming him.

469
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:21,218
You're working here
like some straight-job front...

470
00:38:21,385 --> 00:38:23,595
...While we're planning a heist on Ray.

471
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:27,933
It doesn't mean I don't take pride
in my job.

472
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:31,645
-Should have seen me out there raking.
-Oh, shit.

473
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:37,067
Hey, man.

474
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:38,986
-Jack.
-Hey.

475
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:41,154
-Was that you giggling?
-No.

476
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,740
Must have been Number 9.

477
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:46,410
What are you doing
sneaking around here?

478
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:49,288
I'm not sneaking around.
No, I was just thinking.

479
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:52,457
Sometimes when I'm thinking,
it looks like I'm sneaking.

480
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:56,461
-So, what are you thinking about?
-Oh, you know....

481
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:00,257
-I don't want to bug you.
-Jack...

482
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:02,467
...you gotta have a little faith.

483
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:03,969
What, like in God?

484
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:07,890
Well, God's an imaginary friend
for grownups.

485
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:10,976
Trick is to know who to have faith in.

486
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:13,478
I'm gonna give you a hint.

487
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:17,649
Sometimes things are exactly
as they appear.

488
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:20,194
Sometimes.

489
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:29,536
What the heck does that mean?

490
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:06,865
Get out.

491
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:09,076
I got something for you.

492
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:12,204
Mr. Ritchie's private police come by
about this time.

493
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:14,915
Damn, I don't blame them.

494
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:16,583
Tell me what you want.

495
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:20,879
I got these wallets that I'm gonna sell you
for 1 500 bucks.

496
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,882
The wallets came from a house
that was robbed.

497
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:26,885
-I take them to the police..
-Take them to the police.

498
00:40:27,052 --> 00:40:29,721
-They'll appreciate help.
-I could leave the case...

499
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,767
...someplace where the police will find it
with Jack's name written on it.

500
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:37,104
I'm serious, his private police
Will be here any minute.

501
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:40,691
I've been waiting for hours.
No police have come.

502
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:43,569
So come on, get out.

503
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:46,029
Okay? So we can talk?

504
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:17,603
Just a second.

505
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:21,440
-Hi.
-Want me to look at the showerhead?

506
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:25,611
-Yeah. Sorry, I was just taking a nap.
-Enjoying your stay?

507
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:27,571
I love it. I love it.

508
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:42,336
Impressive.

509
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:52,429
Yeah. Good job.

510
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,018
All right, if you need anything,
just give me a holler.

511
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:02,147
Think about it.

512
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:35,430
Nice work.

513
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,891
Here.

514
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:42,020
Ray will bring the money here Thursday.

515
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:48,193
All we have to do is distract Bob Jr.

516
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:50,320
And cut the phone lines.

517
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:55,367
Which shouldn't be too hard to do.

518
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:57,703
Very masculine feel.

519
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:01,832
What's with the dead moose head
on the wall and the lndian blankets?

520
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:05,377
-It's a hunting lodge.
-Aloha, it's Hawaii.

521
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:07,880
Put a lei on its horns or something.

522
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:11,884
Borrow some Hawaiian shit
from Walter's place.

523
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,221
So you got a plan?

524
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:23,061
-How you doing, Bob?
-What the hell are you doing here?

525
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:30,235
-Bob. Easy, Bob.
-A baseball bat? A tree branch?

526
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:32,112
I got a tire iron in the truck.

527
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:38,035
-What'd you do that for?
-You said you had a tire iron.

528
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:41,038
You bastard! Come here.

529
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,418
Come here.

530
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,435
Brutal.

531
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:12,945
Doesn't work doing that.
You got to put your head forward.

532
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:14,363
Bullshit.

533
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:17,699
Put your head forward
and blow your nose and pinch it.

534
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:20,577
Go on, blow.

535
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:30,045
That's a lot of blood.

536
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:32,673
My wife can get the blood out.

537
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,968
Just have her use cold water.
That'll do it.

538
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:39,263
She'll know what to do.

539
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,557
You all right?

540
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:53,277
You sure showed him.

541
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:56,029
Too bad he's not a girl.

542
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:58,824
-Shut the hell up.
-That's okay.

543
00:44:58,991 --> 00:45:01,326
-It's the thought that counts.
-Count me out.

544
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:03,996
I don't care how much money
is in the lodge.

545
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:07,499
I didn't know how or when you'd say that,
but I knew you would.

546
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:10,836
Police will ask Bob Jr.
if anything strange happened.

547
00:45:11,003 --> 00:45:13,213
-He'll mention this.
-Ray's gonna report...

548
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:17,843
...his leg-breaking payoff money
was stolen? I'm sure.

549
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:20,679
Come on, let's talk about it...

550
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:23,765
...after I've cleaned you up. Okay?

551
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:25,684
Come on.

552
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:29,062
Come on. You were wonderful.

553
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,659
-There's no beer in the fridge.
-ln the cabinet.

554
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:45,495
In the cabinet? What are you, British?

555
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:56,215
Oh, boy.

556
00:46:01,803 --> 00:46:04,389
No beer. Just a bunch of wallets.

557
00:46:04,556 --> 00:46:06,016
Recognize them?

558
00:46:06,225 --> 00:46:09,102
What's the name of the little game
you're playing?

559
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:13,398
Gee, if I didn't know better, Jack,
I'd think you were a moody guy.

560
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:17,069
Well, I'll see you later on. Take care.

561
00:46:17,236 --> 00:46:20,072
Frank-something came here last night.

562
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,700
If I didn't give him 1 500 for the wallets,
he'd go to the cops.

563
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:26,036
-He settled for 450.
-You got robbed.

564
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:29,039
He'd have settled for 1 00.
Why did he think you'd care?

565
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,792
He must figure
We have something going.

566
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:35,128
-He could see the chemistry.
-I guess.

567
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:38,048
Jack, we cannot afford
a loose cannon here.

568
00:46:38,215 --> 00:46:40,717
From where I'm sitting,
you're the loose cannon.

569
00:46:40,884 --> 00:46:43,262
And as far as Frank goes,
that's his story.

570
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:50,561
-Jack, I need you.
-I know. Let me think about it.

571
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:53,605
Okay, I've thought about it.
No, I'm gonna pass.

572
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:55,649
I'm gonna take these with me.

573
00:46:55,816 --> 00:46:57,901
Jackie.

574
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,290
Oh, come on. That's insulting.
Do you think I'm that easy?

575
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:16,295
-Maybe I am that easy.
-You are that easy.

576
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:24,178
-Wait, wait.
-It's probably my mom.

577
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:26,388
Hold that thought.

578
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:30,309
Is your mother hot?

579
00:47:31,268 --> 00:47:34,062
What? I want to know
if you look like mother-daughter.

580
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:35,606
-Easy, Jack.
-Jeez.

581
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:46,909
Hi, gorgeous.

582
00:47:52,164 --> 00:47:54,333
I got 20 minutes, tops.

583
00:47:54,499 --> 00:47:55,959
Ticktock.

584
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:59,338
-Where's Mrs. B.J.?
-She's at the beauty parlor.

585
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:01,590
Getting her hair enlarged?

586
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:04,301
-You taking a shower?
-No.

587
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:06,720
I'm just glad to see you.

588
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:10,015
I was about to.

589
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:14,186
-Maybe you could use some company.
-No.

590
00:48:14,353 --> 00:48:16,522
I like you un-fresh.

591
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:19,691
That little bastard sucker punched me.

592
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,403
-No, you kicked his ass.
-You think?

593
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,573
I'm gonna turn the shower off.

594
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,534
-You wait right here.
-Okay.

595
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:48,345
Who was it down there?

596
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:51,390
The neighborhood watch,
probably looking for you.

597
00:48:51,557 --> 00:48:53,392
You stay in this bed...

598
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:57,729
...and we will get honest to God
dirty serious about finishing this.

599
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:01,024
Come on.

600
00:49:02,818 --> 00:49:04,069
Come on.

601
00:49:04,403 --> 00:49:06,655
-I'll be back.
-Where's my happy ending?

602
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:08,448
Stop.

603
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:22,129
-Fifteen minutes and counting.
-Call this an appetizer.

604
00:49:22,296 --> 00:49:25,465
-Main course, Thursday night.
-Call it whatever you want.

605
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:27,259
Come here.

606
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:31,930
Come here.

607
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:34,057
Oh, shit.

608
00:49:34,433 --> 00:49:37,311
-That's got to be Ray.
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

609
00:49:37,603 --> 00:49:40,230
Look, I have obligations around here,
okay?

610
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:43,066
I'll be back in a flash.

611
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:48,989
Come on.

612
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:53,952
-You're gonna hate me.
-No, I'm not.

613
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:58,123
What? What are you doing?

614
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:02,085
Yeah. Just have your way with me.

615
00:50:11,637 --> 00:50:14,973
-I'll be right back.
-No, What are you doing?

616
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:23,524
-Come on.
-I told you I'd be quick.

617
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:24,983
What did Ray want?

618
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:28,320
He wanted to make sure
that I don't get bored.

619
00:50:31,073 --> 00:50:32,783
Time's up.

620
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:35,786
-lt is not.
-You're not allowing for drive time.

621
00:50:35,953 --> 00:50:38,205
You better cut it out. Teasing's not fair.

622
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:41,667
Nobody's teasing, Bob. Get your shoes.

623
00:50:43,752 --> 00:50:46,338
I don't want you to get in trouble
with the wifey.

624
00:50:46,505 --> 00:50:50,342
Taste the goods now, it might spoil
your appetite for the date Thursday.

625
00:50:50,509 --> 00:50:52,302
But I'm starving right now.

626
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:55,514
You better hurry before
Whatever-her-name-is gets pissed.

627
00:50:55,681 --> 00:50:58,350
See you at the lodge Thursday.

628
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,519
-Thursday!
-Fuck Thursday!

629
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:16,034
At 6:00, Bob Jr. will be waiting
in the hunting lodge for you.

630
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:19,454
Take one shot and blow out a window.

631
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:23,876
Bob Jr.'s kind of a cowboy.
He'll go out, see what's going on.

632
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:27,296
I'll go in the back and grab the money.

633
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:31,008
But what if he comes back in?

634
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:34,386
Blow out another window.

635
00:51:34,553 --> 00:51:38,265
I'll cut the telephone lines,
puncture his tires.

636
00:51:38,432 --> 00:51:43,520
That should give me time to get back
and join Walter for the domino game.

637
00:51:54,031 --> 00:51:56,033
Okay.

638
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:57,576
Go to sleep.

639
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,621
-Good night.
-Good night.

640
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:26,980
So you're sure about
your domino-game cover?

641
00:52:27,147 --> 00:52:29,316
You're sure?

642
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:31,443
Yeah.

643
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,535
-Hello.
-Did you steal my cell phone?

644
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:41,119
Yes.

645
00:52:41,286 --> 00:52:43,705
Do you know if a guy named Victor
called me?

646
00:52:43,872 --> 00:52:45,666
-Yes, he did.
-What did he say?

647
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:47,084
He wanted to apologize.

648
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:50,546
He said stuff in the heat of the moment
he wished he hadn't...

649
00:52:50,712 --> 00:52:52,881
...and hoped that you may forgive him.

650
00:52:53,048 --> 00:52:54,299
-He did?
-Yeah.

651
00:52:54,466 --> 00:52:56,885
That's so sweet.
Think I should call him?

652
00:52:57,052 --> 00:53:01,306
-You have his number?
-Of course I do. Thank you.

653
00:53:02,975 --> 00:53:06,937
-He didn't really call, did he?
-Yeah, he did.

654
00:53:07,145 --> 00:53:09,022
Of course he did.

655
00:53:09,398 --> 00:53:12,693
-Just make that up?
-Jack, last night!

656
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:17,281
I thought you were walking funny.

657
00:53:17,447 --> 00:53:21,326
-I was just gonna ask you that.
-Wasn't sure if that was my imagination.

658
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:26,790
Tell me what first attracted you to me.

659
00:53:26,957 --> 00:53:28,959
-Come on, that's corny.
-No, it's not.

660
00:53:29,126 --> 00:53:31,753
I want to know.
It means a lot to me.

661
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,965
You want the truth or the bullshit?

662
00:53:35,674 --> 00:53:37,301
Either.

663
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,889
You're really easy on the eyes,
but it was really more than that.

664
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:46,935
It was more a sort of strength of character
that you had in your face.

665
00:53:47,102 --> 00:53:51,023
This kind of generosity of spirit.

666
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,443
For all your kind of strutting around
and acting tough...

667
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:58,822
...you remind me of a little kid sometimes,
and I thought that was funny.

668
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:01,533
Okay. Now the truth.

669
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:07,206
If that girl's not careful, she'll wind up
on the business end of my di..

670
00:54:07,372 --> 00:54:11,502
Oh, my God! Shut up.

671
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:17,007
See you later.

672
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:51,250
Jack.

673
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:54,086
-What's up?
-As soon as you can...

674
00:54:54,253 --> 00:54:56,922
...go into town and get some paint
for Number 9.

675
00:54:57,214 --> 00:54:59,091
-Take the Xterra.
-Number 9?

676
00:54:59,258 --> 00:55:04,054
What is it with you and Number 9?
I'm thinking you got something going on.

677
00:55:04,555 --> 00:55:09,142
Well, I thought so,
but she's a devout Catholic.

678
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:10,978
Oh, bless her heart.

679
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:15,023
-Are we still on for dominoes tomorrow?
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Bring cash.

680
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:19,236
-Those guys will kick your ass.
-Noted.

681
00:55:25,242 --> 00:55:26,952
Not me.

682
00:55:27,744 --> 00:55:30,998
Funny how sounds get carried in wind.
Guess it's wind chimes.

683
00:55:31,164 --> 00:55:32,791
I'm super excited to play.

684
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:35,961
And it's payable immediately.
No tears.

685
00:55:36,128 --> 00:55:37,838
Don't forget the paint.

686
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:17,211
Hey, Mrs. Ritchie.

687
00:56:17,503 --> 00:56:19,630
Be careful.

688
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:32,059
Okay. There you go.

689
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:34,478
Give me the glasses.

690
00:56:35,187 --> 00:56:38,273
-Flight okay, Mr. Ritchie?
-The usual. How's the bitch?

691
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,109
-Which bitch?
-Nancy.

692
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:43,820
She's been hanging around
with that Jack asshole.

693
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:46,698
He's here? I told you to run his ass
off the island.

694
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:50,494
I give you a simple damn order,
and you blow it.

695
00:56:50,661 --> 00:56:54,998
Shouldn't have hired a local parasite.
Look, have Lou Harris take care of him.

696
00:56:55,165 --> 00:56:57,668
-Think you can handle that?
-Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

697
00:56:57,835 --> 00:57:00,379
-You useless?
-Of course not.

698
00:57:01,171 --> 00:57:03,549
I got it.
Put my garment bag on top.

699
00:57:03,715 --> 00:57:06,343
-I did, Mrs. Ritchie.
-Good thing.

700
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:09,721
I got it.

701
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:16,228
Come on, Ray, ndale.

702
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:54,391
Hey, wow, you do your marketing here.

703
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,560
Yeah.

704
00:57:56,977 --> 00:58:02,232
-It's no fun without you, Jackie.
-What is it about the produce section?

705
00:58:02,733 --> 00:58:03,984
Why are you grabbing..?

706
00:58:04,943 --> 00:58:07,571
-What happened?
-God, Ritchie's wife walked in.

707
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:16,079
Not my biggest fan. I cannot let her see me.
She could set Ray off and ruin everything.

708
00:58:16,288 --> 00:58:20,375
-Stock boy to aisle three. Broken glass.
-Oh, my God.

709
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:23,253
I thought if she's in residence,
that means....

710
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,673
-Aren't you banished to the hunting lodge?
-Yeah.

711
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:30,052
Okay, that's it.
The plan just crashed and burned.

712
00:58:32,554 --> 00:58:34,264
Do not give up on this. Okay?

713
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:36,683
Let me just think this through.

714
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:39,895
We can both still get what we want.
Okay?

715
00:58:41,146 --> 00:58:42,940
Now you go.

716
00:58:44,983 --> 00:58:46,652
There he is, Frank.

717
00:58:47,653 --> 00:58:49,780
-Hey, Batman.
-Yes?

718
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:53,617
-Still hanging around looking for trouble?
-No. No bat today.

719
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:55,786
I'll tell you what.

720
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:58,413
Next time we meet,
you'll wish you were born...

721
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,624
...with eyes in the back of your head.

722
00:59:00,832 --> 00:59:04,169
How does that turtleneck thing work?
Does it keep your head on?

723
00:59:04,336 --> 00:59:05,671
Funny guy.

724
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:11,343
We're gonna have a "come to Jesus"
talk soon. Very soon.

725
00:59:13,387 --> 00:59:15,973
-Come on, guys.
-Jack.

726
00:59:16,682 --> 00:59:19,601
-New best friend?
-I owe the guy a lot of money, okay?

727
00:59:19,768 --> 00:59:22,062
I just can't blow him off.

728
00:59:22,229 --> 00:59:25,399
-No, you couldn't do that.
-Jack, come on.

729
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:29,736
Frank, Why didn't you put the beer case
behind Kammie's Market like we agreed?

730
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:33,699
You know I have serious money problems.
That's why I hit up your girl.

731
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:37,828
Don't mess this up for me.
I'm into something good. Come on, Frank.

732
00:59:38,787 --> 00:59:41,874
-What am I supposed to do?
-Have a little faith in people.

733
00:59:42,124 --> 00:59:45,335
Not God because he's just
an imaginary friend for grownups.

734
00:59:45,544 --> 00:59:47,880
-What the hell does that mean?
-I don't know.

735
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:50,507
Come on.
You're up to something, and I know it.

736
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,469
I was into something. It just fell apart.
That's the truth.

737
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:57,764
And that's good because I don't need
any more court dates.

738
00:59:59,641 --> 01:00:03,437
That's the truth.
That's a good-looking shirt, by the way.

739
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:08,775
-Give me 1 0.
-This is nothing like mahjong.

740
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:10,944
-You play mahjong?
-No.

741
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:14,198
-Hello.
-Walter, put our boy on the phone.

742
01:00:14,364 --> 01:00:16,033
It's for you.

743
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:18,911
-Hello.
-I know you can 't talk right now.

744
01:00:19,077 --> 01:00:21,163
-Here's what I found out.
-No, I'm fine.

745
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:24,625
-It's good to hear your voice.
-Bob Jr. has strict orders...

746
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:28,295
...to take me to the hunting lodge.
The money's at the beach house.

747
01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:31,590
-We can't do it then.
-I'll keep Bob Jr. at the lodge.

748
01:00:31,757 --> 01:00:36,053
You know the layout. The money
will be in the office safe. We are so close.

749
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:39,431
-Where's Ritchie?
-He'll be out of the house at 5:30.

750
01:00:39,598 --> 01:00:43,101
You can break into the house
with only that helpless drunk in it.

751
01:00:43,268 --> 01:00:46,730
-I think I'm gonna pass.
-Two hundred thousand dollars.

752
01:00:47,147 --> 01:00:49,483
-Not enough.
-The key for the sliding door...

753
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:51,777
...and combination
will be under the mat.

754
01:00:51,944 --> 01:00:54,530
All you do is walk in poor
and walk out rich.

755
01:00:54,696 --> 01:00:57,824
What will happen if that money
reaches those thugs?

756
01:00:57,991 --> 01:01:01,286
-They'll probably have a hell of a luau.
-I mean to Walter.

757
01:01:01,453 --> 01:01:05,582
-He'll probably get invited.
-Jack, just tell me you'll think about it.

758
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:08,252
All right, I'll bring the poi.

759
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,421
-lf not for us, do it for Walter.
-What?

760
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:15,467
Because sooner or later,
Ray will bulldoze Keiki Vista under the sand.

761
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:17,553
All right. Take care.

762
01:01:20,305 --> 01:01:22,182
Wrong number.

763
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:27,187
Nancy burying a pig?

764
01:01:29,314 --> 01:01:30,941
Getting in deep, aren't you?

765
01:01:31,692 --> 01:01:33,360
I don't know about this girl.

766
01:01:33,527 --> 01:01:36,613
A part of me thinks
she could be the answer.

767
01:01:36,822 --> 01:01:41,451
Then a part of me thinks you're gonna
open up the paper one day, and it will be:

768
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:46,748
"The partially nude body of yours truly
was found floating in Waimea Bay.

769
01:01:46,915 --> 01:01:49,209
Nancy Hayes sought for questioning."

770
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:53,422
I've been expecting to read headlines
like that about Nancy since she was 1 5.

771
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:57,176
-She's not dull.
-No, nobody's ever said that about her.

772
01:01:57,342 --> 01:02:01,180
But I'm warning you, Jack,
you're sticking your neck way out.

773
01:02:01,346 --> 01:02:03,390
No, I'm fine.

774
01:02:03,557 --> 01:02:05,684
She just has a little mischief in her...

775
01:02:05,851 --> 01:02:08,896
...that makes it kind of fun to be around.

776
01:02:09,062 --> 01:02:13,525
The other day, she took off her clothes
and then folded them in neat little piles.

777
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:16,737
-lt was--
-You really are smitten.

778
01:02:17,946 --> 01:02:21,783
Sometimes you get so alone,
it just makes sense.

779
01:02:22,618 --> 01:02:25,412
-Does that make sense?
-Hell, no.

780
01:02:26,622 --> 01:02:31,001
If you think you're gonna control this girl
or control yourself with her...

781
01:02:31,168 --> 01:02:34,546
...you've got a mind-breaking realization
coming, son.

782
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:36,715
She's nothing but trouble.

783
01:02:36,882 --> 01:02:40,511
The problem is a lot of stuff you say
makes me want to be around her.

784
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:42,638
Okay.

785
01:02:42,804 --> 01:02:45,432
Well, I'm through talking about her.

786
01:02:46,808 --> 01:02:50,521
So where does Ritchie stow her
now that the bride is back?

787
01:02:50,729 --> 01:02:54,024
-They all sleep in the same bed?
-ls Mrs. Ritchie back?

788
01:02:54,399 --> 01:02:56,944
Well, he doesn't let her get very far.

789
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:01,281
-All of his assets are in her name.
-Shit, why doesn't she divorce him...

790
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:03,617
...and take it all?

791
01:03:04,284 --> 01:03:08,413
I think they got some sort of
prenuptial agreement in place.

792
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:11,208
Or so I hear.

793
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:17,130
-Want to try again?
-Fire it up.

794
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:32,563
-What are you looking at?
-I'm putting my key under the mat.

795
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:34,940
Remember?

796
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:38,694
You weren't at the supermarket.

797
01:03:38,861 --> 01:03:41,113
-Thought you chickened out.
-Jack showed up.

798
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,324
I had to get him out
before he saw us together.

799
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:48,954
Tell me that's number one, Alison.

800
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,748
I can't do it.

801
01:03:52,249 --> 01:03:55,419
Ray's acting all weird.
I think he knows something.

802
01:03:55,878 --> 01:03:57,713
What time will Jack show up here?

803
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,841
He will walk through that door
at 6:00 sharp.

804
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:04,303
I will make sure that Bob Jr.
is nowhere to be found.

805
01:04:04,469 --> 01:04:08,682
From now on, Alison, it's your show.

806
01:04:08,849 --> 01:04:10,851
My show.

807
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:16,440
And, sweetie, lay off the booze.

808
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:27,201
And stay off my boat!

809
01:04:45,761 --> 01:04:48,972
-Hey!
-You hold it right there. Hold it!

810
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:52,476
You, get out of the car! This way!
Stand there.

811
01:04:52,643 --> 01:04:54,269
-Come on.
-Whoa.

812
01:04:54,436 --> 01:04:55,938
-You "whoa"!
-All right.

813
01:04:56,104 --> 01:04:57,648
-Get down.
-Look, Harris.

814
01:04:57,814 --> 01:05:00,817
Being stupid doesn't mean you want to die.
My name is..

815
01:05:01,026 --> 01:05:02,694
-Shut up!
-Don't do that, Harris.

816
01:05:02,861 --> 01:05:06,156
You've caused enough bollocks.
You want to piss with me?

817
01:05:06,323 --> 01:05:09,368
I don't understand what you're saying.
Want to piss with you?

818
01:05:09,535 --> 01:05:12,037
-Walter, don't. It might go off.
-All right.

819
01:05:18,961 --> 01:05:20,420
I tried to warn him.

820
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:51,243
So, anyway, this skeleton walks
into a bar.

821
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:56,039
Skeleton goes to the bartender and says,
"Give me a pitcher of beer...

822
01:05:56,206 --> 01:05:58,500
...and a mop."

823
01:06:00,586 --> 01:06:02,629
We're gonna play $1 00 cutthroat.

824
01:06:02,796 --> 01:06:04,423
Do you know how to play that?

825
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:09,178
This is..
Now I've got five, for chrissake.

826
01:06:10,512 --> 01:06:14,433
-lt gets less each time you shuffle.
-You're supposed to take seven out.

827
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,936
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Shouldn't quit on five.

828
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:21,315
-That's a sign of weakness.
-What have you guys..? Got eight?

829
01:06:21,481 --> 01:06:23,233
No, I have seven.

830
01:06:23,442 --> 01:06:25,736
So, anyway, Jack steps up.

831
01:06:25,903 --> 01:06:27,654
-"Cheap Shot" Jack.
-My specialty.

832
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:30,282
He gives him a straight left
to that broke jaw.

833
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:33,410
Man, that guy dropped like a brick!

834
01:06:33,619 --> 01:06:36,663
That is the best late excuse
you've ever come up with.

835
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:40,417
I'm telling you the truth.
Am I lying, Jack?

836
01:06:45,714 --> 01:06:47,424
Sorry I'm late.

837
01:06:49,134 --> 01:06:51,094
You kept me waiting.

838
01:06:51,428 --> 01:06:54,723
I'm sure we can work out
a proper punishment.

839
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:58,435
The thing is, Nancy, I can't stay.

840
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:03,357
-What do you mean?
-I mean I can't go through with this...

841
01:07:03,524 --> 01:07:05,901
...assignation.

842
01:07:07,027 --> 01:07:09,154
What's going on, Junior?

843
01:07:10,614 --> 01:07:13,492
-Ariana's in the car.
-Your wife?

844
01:07:13,659 --> 01:07:16,787
-What is your wife doing in the car?
-Don't get mad, Nancy.

845
01:07:16,995 --> 01:07:21,124
I'm not mad. I'm just confused.

846
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:24,711
-Talk.
-She knows about us.

847
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:28,465
-Knows what?
-I told her.

848
01:07:28,674 --> 01:07:30,342
There's nothing to tell.

849
01:07:30,509 --> 01:07:34,137
The other day, she said
that I smelled different.

850
01:07:34,346 --> 01:07:38,642
-"I've been to a strip club, Ariana."
-I gotta get out of here.

851
01:07:38,809 --> 01:07:41,311
You can't just leave me here...

852
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,855
...Iike this.

853
01:07:46,525 --> 01:07:48,151
Ariana?

854
01:07:48,527 --> 01:07:51,154
It's our own private honk.

855
01:07:52,698 --> 01:07:55,325
I'm sorry. I've said everything
I came to say.

856
01:07:57,703 --> 01:08:02,332
Maybe we should invite your wife
in here to join us.

857
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:06,378
You know, just the three of us.
You know.

858
01:08:06,545 --> 01:08:10,382
That's a really bad idea.

859
01:08:11,383 --> 01:08:14,219
You had a rough start,
and you're trying to find your..

860
01:08:14,386 --> 01:08:17,431
You don't know anything
about who I am, Bob.

861
01:08:17,973 --> 01:08:19,391
Okay.

862
01:08:20,017 --> 01:08:24,021
Look, I'm just a whim to you,
a way of getting back at Ray.

863
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:26,523
Hell, I'm guilty of those same whims.

864
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:30,068
I mean, you are a knockout,
in a slutty kind of way.

865
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:35,407
There's got to be a loaded gun
around here someplace.

866
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:18,242
-All right, let's cut the crap. Who's first?
-Me. Five.

867
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:20,285
You might have set something up.

868
01:09:20,452 --> 01:09:22,621
-Give me 1 5.
-Good play.

869
01:09:22,788 --> 01:09:24,998
-Wait a minute. I got a four.
-Goddamn it.

870
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:28,293
-You can't do that.
-How much is that?

871
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:32,005
-You'd think I'd never played this game.
-Fours, deuces or fives.

872
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:35,926
-Searching for a pulse, Walter?
-Did I set my pipe down somewhere?

873
01:09:36,343 --> 01:09:39,638
Is this another one of your strategic
diversionary tactics?

874
01:09:39,805 --> 01:09:42,808
-No, I know I grabbed it. I picked it up.
-I'll get it.

875
01:09:42,975 --> 01:09:45,143
-You don't have to do that.
-I'll get it.

876
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:48,772
I don't want you to have any excuses
when you lose this game.

877
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:50,607
He's interrupting the flow.

878
01:09:50,816 --> 01:09:53,277
No, you're interrupting. Let's play.

879
01:09:53,443 --> 01:09:56,488
He reminds me of you, Joe.

880
01:09:57,489 --> 01:09:59,199
-Thanks, Jack.
-I love you, Joe.

881
01:09:59,825 --> 01:10:01,952
Somebody play. I'm getting old.

882
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:04,454
That kid's a sweetheart.

883
01:10:32,316 --> 01:10:36,236
Umbrella drinks on me, mahalo.

884
01:10:38,488 --> 01:10:40,991
Now he gets interesting.

885
01:10:55,881 --> 01:10:57,341
Bang!

886
01:11:50,269 --> 01:11:51,895
Oh, shit.

887
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:53,897
Oh, God.

888
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:30,684
Don't bounce too high.

889
01:12:30,851 --> 01:12:33,937
Praise the Lord, Jackie. You're still alive.

890
01:12:34,104 --> 01:12:36,481
I couldn't do it. I raced back to warn you.

891
01:12:36,648 --> 01:12:38,567
To warn me?

892
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:41,653
You set me up.

893
01:12:42,863 --> 01:12:46,283
I swear, I couldn't let them kill you.

894
01:12:46,825 --> 01:12:50,412
And look, you have the $200,000
in your hand.

895
01:12:50,871 --> 01:12:52,956
You weren't lying about that.

896
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,878
God, wouldn't it be great
if you were telling the truth?

897
01:12:58,045 --> 01:13:00,255
I wonder what that would look like.

898
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:03,300
It looks like this.

899
01:13:06,178 --> 01:13:07,971
So who did she shoot?

900
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:11,391
I was going for the back door,
but my friend beat me to it.

901
01:13:11,558 --> 01:13:13,393
He took a bullet for me.

902
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,771
Bless his heart.

903
01:13:19,525 --> 01:13:22,486
-Shit!
-What?

904
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:26,532
-What? I shot Jack.
-No.

905
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:31,078
-Who did I shoot?
-I don't know.

906
01:13:31,245 --> 01:13:34,581
Some random.

907
01:13:35,707 --> 01:13:38,877
Well, there goes that plan.

908
01:13:39,044 --> 01:13:42,130
How did he get in here?
How did he know where the key was?

909
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:49,179
-I think I forgot to lock the door.
-You were drinking?

910
01:13:50,722 --> 01:13:53,600
I had a couple of toddies.

911
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:58,188
-Am I dead, and no one told me?
-No, no.

912
01:13:58,397 --> 01:14:00,023
Oh, honey.

913
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:02,025
What about that night we had?

914
01:14:02,192 --> 01:14:04,820
-What about it?
-You know...

915
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:08,031
...that there was a real connection there.
You know it.

916
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:11,410
Yeah, I know. But there are a couple
of bodies downstairs...

917
01:14:11,577 --> 01:14:15,789
...and your brilliant partners
are figuring out a way to pin it on you.

918
01:14:16,415 --> 01:14:18,959
If you're smart,
Which you haven't been so far...

919
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:23,839
...you'll get off this island real quick.
You better swim for it.

920
01:14:24,256 --> 01:14:27,926
I'm sorry you don't believe me.
You'll never get over me.

921
01:14:28,093 --> 01:14:30,721
Yeah. So long.

922
01:14:39,146 --> 01:14:41,023
He's not breathing.

923
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,276
Can't get a pulse.

924
01:14:44,443 --> 01:14:46,778
Sometimes they put a mirror
under their nose.

925
01:14:47,362 --> 01:14:50,490
-How much did you dose him?
-I emptied the bottle.

926
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:55,662
You could put down a troop train
with a whole bottle, Al.

927
01:14:55,829 --> 01:14:59,333
Honey, the plan was to kill Jack.

928
01:14:59,499 --> 01:15:02,002
Right? With his record, a perfect patsy.

929
01:15:02,169 --> 01:15:05,088
Then kill an unconscious Ray
with a baseball bat.

930
01:15:05,255 --> 01:15:08,300
Then it looks like Jack broke in,
killed Ray...

931
01:15:08,467 --> 01:15:12,346
...you shot Jack in self-defense.
Don't you remember? We went over it.

932
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:16,767
-Right. To cover up the robbery.
-No, no, no. Honey, no.

933
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:20,938
To kill Ray and hush money Nancy.

934
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:24,399
Now two bodies to dispose of.

935
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:27,528
-And neither one of them is Jack.
-And that's a big deal.

936
01:15:27,819 --> 01:15:30,864
Yeah. Jack can nail us.

937
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:37,371
Jesus, lady!

938
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:40,749
You shot me!

939
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:53,637
One body just disposed of itself.

940
01:15:53,804 --> 01:15:55,681
I'll be damned.

941
01:15:55,848 --> 01:15:58,308
Oh, Walter, I don't want to be executed.

942
01:15:58,475 --> 01:16:01,854
No need to worry about that, sugar.

943
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:04,314
Hawaii doesn't have the death penalty.

944
01:16:04,481 --> 01:16:07,484
-Oh, thank God.
-Yeah.

945
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:12,114
Well, at least Ray is dead.

946
01:16:12,823 --> 01:16:16,493
-Should I whack him with the bat anyway?
-No, no, no. No.

947
01:16:17,703 --> 01:16:20,914
No, We need a new plan.

948
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:22,749
New patsy.

949
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:24,710
Ray.

950
01:16:25,335 --> 01:16:27,421
He shot...

951
01:16:27,588 --> 01:16:29,381
...some guy...

952
01:16:29,548 --> 01:16:33,010
-...and then killed himself.
-With a bat?

953
01:16:34,636 --> 01:16:37,139
Or the other way around.

954
01:16:38,473 --> 01:16:40,809
Don't think, babe.

955
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:42,895
Bad for the team.

956
01:16:44,730 --> 01:16:47,566
How about Nancy?

957
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:50,944
Genius.

958
01:16:51,528 --> 01:16:53,530
I hate her.

959
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:57,701
Okay.

960
01:17:01,205 --> 01:17:03,916
I came to warn you, Jack.

961
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:08,045
That's Jack?

962
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,884
And there it was. Son of a bitch.

963
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,763
Walter's words running through
my head like a loop.

964
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:22,100
"Sometimes things
are exactly as they appear. "

965
01:17:22,267 --> 01:17:23,644
It's catchy.

966
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:25,812
Like an epitaph.

967
01:18:33,213 --> 01:18:35,090
-Hey.
-Hey.

968
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:37,718
Not much of a good hitching spot.

969
01:18:37,885 --> 01:18:40,053
No, not much.

970
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:42,181
Maybe it' s that disguise.

971
01:18:43,015 --> 01:18:44,558
You like it?

972
01:18:45,517 --> 01:18:48,645
-Where are you going?
-I'm escaping.

973
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:52,357
I'd like to know which one of you geniuses
came up with this plan.

974
01:18:54,359 --> 01:18:58,864
It just sort of happened after I caught
Walter and Alison going at it on the boat.

975
01:18:59,031 --> 01:19:02,367
Walter and Alison were going at it?

976
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:04,578
-Good Lord.
-So anyway...

977
01:19:04,745 --> 01:19:06,997
...blackmail came immediately to mind.

978
01:19:07,206 --> 01:19:10,042
But Walter figured a way for us
to get what we wanted.

979
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:13,378
I'll have to be sober if I ever try
to tell this story.

980
01:19:13,545 --> 01:19:16,673
Oh, Jack, come on.
You were scamming me.

981
01:19:17,216 --> 01:19:20,844
Breaking into Ray's,
getting close to me to get next to him.

982
01:19:21,011 --> 01:19:24,306
I mean, what were you after, anyway?

983
01:19:24,473 --> 01:19:27,184
I know it wasn't just about me.

984
01:19:29,728 --> 01:19:31,271
Was it?

985
01:19:31,563 --> 01:19:34,191
No. Come on.

986
01:19:34,358 --> 01:19:37,152
Those paintings on the wall were..

987
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:40,113
Could fetch a pretty penny
in the right circles.

988
01:19:40,531 --> 01:19:44,368
Jack, we don't know anybody
in the right circles.

989
01:19:44,535 --> 01:19:49,957
-I know plenty of people in plenty of circles.
-Why stop if you still don't believe me?

990
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:52,459
I said to myself, "Maybe...

991
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:55,963
...she's telling the truth.
Maybe she did come back to warn me.

992
01:19:56,129 --> 01:20:00,509
Part of me thinks she's trying to have me
picked off like a shooting gallery duck."

993
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:04,638
Would I leave you the combination
if I was trying to get you killed?

994
01:20:04,805 --> 01:20:08,267
-Would I do that?
-You're practically my guardian angel.

995
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:13,397
Come here. Give me a kiss.

996
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:15,607
You want a kiss?

997
01:20:15,774 --> 01:20:17,401
Just a little one.

998
01:20:17,985 --> 01:20:20,571
I'll give you a kiss for good luck.

999
01:20:21,655 --> 01:20:23,323
Thank you.

1000
01:20:44,178 --> 01:20:45,804
Like Walter says:

1001
01:20:45,971 --> 01:20:47,973
"Sometimes you gotta have faith.

1002
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:52,186
And a little luck never hurts. "

1003
01:28:00,364 --> 01:28:02,366
