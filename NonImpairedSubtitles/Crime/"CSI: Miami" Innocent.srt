1
00:00:17,782 --> 00:00:19,462
Kyle, come on.

2
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:21,757
- Once is enough.
- One more time.

3
00:00:21,757 --> 00:00:24,196
You might like it.

4
00:00:24,196 --> 00:00:27,355
Ah, come on baby, 
it won't take that long.

5
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,172
Wait, wait.

6
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:35,267
What is that?

7
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:39,623
- It's your phone, let it ring.
- No, no, I turned mine off.

8
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,472
Stop!

9
00:00:58,327 --> 00:00:59,917
Oh my God.

10
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:02,162
Oh my God, oh my god!

11
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,594
Are you all right?

12
00:01:11,594 --> 00:01:15,120
Yeah, just can't believe  
she was lying there the whole time.

13
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,584
Did you touch anything 
else besides the cellphone?

14
00:01:17,584 --> 00:01:21,180
No way, we were freaked.
We called 911 the moment we saw her.

15
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,789
Yeah, on my cell. / Good.

16
00:01:24,913 --> 00:01:27,869
Would you mind sticking around,
so I can get a complete statement?

17
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,284
Yeah sure, whatever you need.

18
00:01:29,284 --> 00:01:31,226
Thank you.

19
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:33,692
You got an ID?

20
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:36,529
Waiting on Alexx 
to check her effects.

21
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,176
Caucasian, early twenties, 
no handbag.

22
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:41,444
Significant impressions 
around her body though,

23
00:01:41,444 --> 00:01:42,991
she might have been dumped.

24
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:44,221
Those two find her?

25
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:46,627
Yes, college kids 
from uh, Florida U.

26
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:48,574
They heard a cell phone ring.

27
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:51,263
So I'm gonna look 
into who made that call.

28
00:01:51,263 --> 00:01:54,527
May tell us who she is. / We may 
have been beaten to the punch.

29
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:57,744
Ten uniforms at a crime scene, 
that seems excessive.

30
00:01:57,744 --> 00:01:59,920
Excuse me.

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,642
We're gonna have 
to block up another twenty.

32
00:02:02,642 --> 00:02:04,046
Lieutenant.

33
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:06,204
We have a VIP situation here.

34
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:09,186
She's, uh, actually  
an actress lieutenant.

35
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:10,328
What's her name?

36
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:13,346
Ashley Anders, 
she does pay-per-view, dvds.

37
00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:15,744
Responding officers 
recognized her from her films.

38
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:17,429
So she does adult films.

39
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,856
Yes sir, she's a porn star.

40
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:22,161
She's also,

41
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:24,389
somebody's daughter,

42
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:25,845
and that,

43
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,595
is what we focus on.

44
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:05,869
CSI:MIAMI 
2x24  Innocent

45
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,322
Something in her hair Alexx.

46
00:03:24,322 --> 00:03:27,392
Sticky substance.

47
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:32,069
Doesn't look like a biological.

48
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:33,905
All right, I'll get it to trace.

49
00:03:33,905 --> 00:03:37,491
In the mean time 
we've got keys, an mp3 player,

50
00:03:37,491 --> 00:03:39,791
and twenty dollars
that we found in her pocket.

51
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,247
So I guess that rules out robbery.

52
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:46,237
I think this rules out robbery.
Hand marks on her neck.

53
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,396
Petechial hemorrhage.

54
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:49,931
She was strangled.

55
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:51,040
Looking that way.

56
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,517
So the killer was up close and 
personal, may be someone she knew.

57
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:55,905
More than likely.

58
00:03:55,905 --> 00:03:59,203
The thing is, a lot of 
people knew Ashley Anders.

59
00:03:59,203 --> 00:04:04,079
She had one of the top-selling 
dvds in the adult market.

60
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,698
I've heard.

61
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:09,147
Well if this was a sex crime, 
something doesn't add up.

62
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:11,459
Vic is fully clothed.

63
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,265
- May be they redressed her.
- Then they're good honey.

64
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:17,278
No bunching.
It's tough to redress deadweight.

65
00:04:17,278 --> 00:04:19,534
I'll know more at the post.

66
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:25,606
Hey. / Hi.

67
00:04:25,606 --> 00:04:26,762
Get anything?

68
00:04:26,762 --> 00:04:29,214
Well, our victim's 
family lives in Minnesota,

69
00:04:29,214 --> 00:04:31,753
- still trying to track them down.
- What about an employer?

70
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:35,310
Palm Grove industries, she's 
made over a hundred films for them.

71
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,845
Palm Grove industires?

72
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:41,104
It's one of the biggest corporations in the state.
That's the David Jeffers family right?

73
00:04:41,104 --> 00:04:45,294
Well, must be why she's being paid by
subsidiary company called Fallen films.

74
00:04:45,294 --> 00:04:47,677
Fallen films,

75
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:49,405
Ok. / Oh, and

76
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:50,733
Horatio. / Yeah.

77
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:53,445
If this case goes into Friday,

78
00:04:53,445 --> 00:04:55,138
um, I'll have Hagan fill in for me.

79
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:56,378
- Is that all right?
- You ok?

80
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:58,834
Oh yeah, I just um,

81
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:01,660
have plans for the weekend.

82
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:08,877
Um, no it's fine.

83
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:10,276
Ok good. / Sure.

84
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,257
Thanks. / Yeah.

85
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:17,098
¢Ý  SiaÀÇ 'Breathe me' ¢Ý

86
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:25,063
¢Ý  Help I have done it again ¢Ý

87
00:05:25,063 --> 00:05:33,071
¢Ý  I have been here many times before ¢Ý

88
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:41,106
¢Ý  Hurt myself again today ¢Ý

89
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:50,113
¢Ý  And the worst part is 
there's no one else to blame ¢Ý

90
00:05:50,113 --> 00:05:55,360
¢Ý  be my friend ¢Ý

91
00:05:56,028 --> 00:06:02,021
¢Ý  hold Me, wrap me up ¢Ý

92
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:11,694
¢Ý  unfold me, I am small ¢Ý

93
00:06:11,694 --> 00:06:19,620
¢Ý  and needy warm me up ¢Ý

94
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,054
¢Ý  and breathe me ¢Ý

95
00:06:25,054 --> 00:06:28,834
Make up off, she looks 
like the girl next door.

96
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:30,269
Physical findings?

97
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:32,468
No vaginal injuries, 
I collected a kit.

98
00:06:32,468 --> 00:06:34,659
Doesn't appear to 
be any biological fluids.

99
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,048
COD, Alexx?

100
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:38,814
Asphyxiation caused 
by manual strangulation.

101
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:41,853
Killer on top, used both hands.

102
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:53,023
- You scraped under her finger nails?
- I sent the scrapings to trace.

103
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,152
Okay, time of death.

104
00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:58,047
Rigor mortis puts the time of 
death about ten to twelve hours ago,

105
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:02,718
but I may be able to tell you 
where she was couple of hours before.

106
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:04,667
Stomach contents.

107
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,472
Look what's at the bottom.

108
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:08,314
Looks like caviar.

109
00:07:08,314 --> 00:07:09,908
I'm guessing Russian.

110
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:11,678
200 bucks a spoon-full?

111
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:14,777
She was at a party 
or a club of some kind.

112
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:18,672
Okay, I'll have Yelina take a look.
Thank you Alexx.

113
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,728
Hey, What's this about?
The evidence hasn't been logged yet.

114
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:25,596
Oh, I'm sorry.
Dad I've gotta go.

115
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:28,682
The Savannah, I'll 
see you there, I promise.

116
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,610
Trace said you had the finger
nail scrapings from our porn girl.

117
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,604
It's in here somewhere.

118
00:07:33,604 --> 00:07:35,546
You ever seen any 
Ashley Anders movies?

119
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:37,641
Me? No.
Where would I see'em?

120
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:40,879
Oh, clubs, parties, you know, out.

121
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,485
No, I don't think you and I are going 
to the same places Valera.

122
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:46,340
Porns that do martini.

123
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,562
No one's hiding their vices anymore.

124
00:07:48,562 --> 00:07:50,813
Here it is.

125
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:55,678
Blood and tissue under our 
victim's nails is from a David Jeffers.

126
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:57,765
Palm Grove's David Jeffers?

127
00:07:57,765 --> 00:08:00,016
He's the CEO that 
distributes Ashley's movies.

128
00:08:00,016 --> 00:08:02,808
I know. Ran 
Mr.Upstanding through CODIS.

129
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:05,436
He's in the system for a stat 
rape back in grad school.

130
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:08,379
Ah, that makes him 
a registered sex offender.

131
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:10,851
I wonder if it took place in a park.

132
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:14,288
Matter of fact it did. 
Biscayne.

133
00:08:16,992 --> 00:08:21,024
Mr. Jeffers, this is about 
one of your employees, Ashley Anders.

134
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:23,868
She was murdered last night.

135
00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:30,155
that's terrible, but I don't 
know anything about this girl.

136
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:32,467
My client owns 
a conglomerate of businesses,

137
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:35,187
one of which happens 
to distribute adult titles.

138
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:37,455
It's assuming a lot to think he knows 
each employee personally.

139
00:08:37,455 --> 00:08:39,390
Oh, CSIs never assume.

140
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,314
We found your DNA under 
the dead girl's finger nails, Mr. Jeffers.

141
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:47,675
So, what happened? Did things get 
a little rough after the party last night?

142
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:49,465
A party?

143
00:08:49,465 --> 00:08:51,584
I checked your security log.

144
00:08:51,584 --> 00:08:54,239
Very informative.

145
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:57,814
Ashley attended your 
party at this very office, last night.

146
00:08:57,814 --> 00:09:02,009
She had champagne, 
caviar and got strangled.

147
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,934
So, you two wanna step outside 
while we execute the warrant?

148
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:09,181
It'll be my pleasure to escort you.
Gentlemen.

149
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:31,771
A meeting with your client Mr. Galas.

150
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,794
A 3000...

151
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:36,590
They said the jet'll be refueled by

152
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:38,800
Relax David, we don't have to panic.

153
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,270
Don't tell me not to panic.

154
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,069
That bitch screwed us.
It's under control.

155
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:43,265
The hell it is.

156
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:46,152
Take care of the Ashley 
situation or it's your ass.

157
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:51,981
That was a business discussion.

158
00:09:51,981 --> 00:09:53,769
It's protected 
by attorney-client privilege.

159
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:57,221
A judge may not see it that way,

160
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,354
- in a murder case.
- I didn't murder anyone.

161
00:09:59,354 --> 00:10:01,964
You don't have to say anything David.

162
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:03,411
I've got nothing to hide.

163
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:06,878
You were with Ashley 
last night weren't you?

164
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:10,517
I was entertaining some clients and

165
00:10:10,517 --> 00:10:15,317
I decided to invites some girls to come 
on over you know, to spice up the party.

166
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,178
Ashley decided she wanted to leave.

167
00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:29,388
I told her I sign your movies, 
you'd better damn well sell my clients.

168
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:31,614
- I'm sick of this.- You're not going anywhere.

169
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:33,084
- I can't do this anymore.
- You leave when I say.

170
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:35,406
- You can't stop me.
- The heck I can't.

171
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:40,771
She scratched my neck, she left, 
that's all that happened.

172
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:44,648
My client is a prominent businessman 
with strong ties to the community.

173
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:46,894
He has a family and three little girls.

174
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:50,897
Will they be appearing in your
films Mr.Jeffers when they grow up?

175
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:53,630
Just out of curiosity.

176
00:10:57,754 --> 00:10:59,871
These actresses have free will.

177
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:03,457
Besides, it's not like we do gonzo porn,
we have story lines, we have plots.

178
00:11:03,457 --> 00:11:05,636
You are a regular Paddy Chayefsky

179
00:11:05,636 --> 00:11:08,825
- Are you arresting my client?
- Not at present.

180
00:11:17,454 --> 00:11:19,845
take care of this Ashley 
business or it's your ass

181
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,753
Relax David, 
we don't have to panic.

182
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:01,611
Eric, what happened?

183
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:04,571
Made a spill, 
concentrated hydrochloric acid.

184
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:06,219
What did we lose?

185
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:07,978
Jeffer's answering machine tape.

186
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,026
I was duping it for the courts,

187
00:12:10,026 --> 00:12:12,381
and the concentrated HCL fumes

188
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:15,060
ruined the Ferric oxide powder that 
coats the tape's polliment back.

189
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,542
So the tape is spoiled.
Is it salvageable?

190
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:18,842
Lietenant Caine,

191
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:24,508
do you really think the CSI responsible for destorying 
the original evidence should be assigned to the case?

192
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:26,992
I don't remember 
asking your opinion Rick.

193
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:29,915
Well the commander suggested 
I may be should check into this.

194
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,306
Find out how 
this accident occurred,

195
00:12:32,306 --> 00:12:36,255
and which employee may be involved 
in undermining a major murder investigation,

196
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,567
not to mention compromising 
countless other cases.

197
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,322
It is uh, Delko right?

198
00:12:41,322 --> 00:12:43,886
Eric would you give 
us a minute please?

199
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:45,576
Sure H.

200
00:12:46,824 --> 00:12:50,895
H, see that could be interpreted 
as a lack of respect for a superior.

201
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,277
You know I am willing 
to take that chance.

202
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:57,021
So as his superior, 
did Delko screw up?

203
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:59,847
No, if anybody did, I did.

204
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:02,699
You did, ha, you weren't 
even in the building at that time.

205
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,897
Yelina said you were at the PD.

206
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:08,104
My lab, my oversight.

207
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:10,813
You cover up a lot of 
people's screw ups don't ya?

208
00:13:10,813 --> 00:13:14,770
Delko and evidence, 
your brother and that girl.

209
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,833
What was her name, Susy right?

210
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,205
Rick, that is a private matter.

211
00:13:19,205 --> 00:13:23,719
You see, I see a pattern of you withholding
critical information and I've opened a file on you.

212
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,079
Walk away.

213
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,766
You ran an outside 
DNA check through our lab.

214
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:30,221
That sample was related to the case.

215
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:32,649
Yes, but that makes 
it department business.

216
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:35,006
And by the way, Susy right?

217
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:37,304
Her kid, little Madison,

218
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:38,665
it's your brother's kid.

219
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:42,730
How long are you 
gonna hide that from Yelina?

220
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:45,664
Rick, this is ...

221
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:48,041
an unwise course 
of action for you.

222
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,390
That a threat?

223
00:13:52,946 --> 00:13:56,379
Just remember what I said.

224
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:01,087
And another criminalist 
will be doing this investigation.

225
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,672
You better find more 
evidence on Jeffers.

226
00:14:17,354 --> 00:14:20,531
Blonda Palousa?

227
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:23,630
28 Lays later?

228
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,149
She's gotta have her 
own aisle at the video store.

229
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:28,210
Yeah, Valera says she's famous.

230
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,255
Well, Valera would know,
wouldn't she?

231
00:14:30,255 --> 00:14:32,991
Hey did you see that 
dog bowl in the kitchen?

232
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,663
Yeah, but no dog.

233
00:14:34,663 --> 00:14:36,706
I'll check the local kennels.

234
00:14:36,706 --> 00:14:39,643
Did you clear this side? / Yeah.

235
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:48,074
I've got semen on the bed.

236
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,129
Hmm, she is a porno star.

237
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:54,053
Yeah, but the apartment manager says 
she never brings guys back to her place.

238
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:56,473
What about fans?

239
00:14:56,905 --> 00:14:59,337
Oh good, fan mail.

240
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,410
Yeah, they're all 
addressed to Ashley Anders,

241
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,491
care Fallen films.

242
00:15:06,491 --> 00:15:09,505
I guess someone 
figured out where she lived.

243
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:11,136
Okay. I'll tell you what.

244
00:15:11,136 --> 00:15:15,093
I will process the letters
if you do the films.

245
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:18,250
This is her most recent film.

246
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,984
Well, anything that sheds some 
light on who this girl might have been.

247
00:15:21,984 --> 00:15:25,465
Well then forget the films. DVD extras,

248
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:29,106
these discs are backed 
with them. Here's one.

249
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:32,998
Oops.

250
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:36,707
I think I saw something 
on the setup menu.

251
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:39,849
Hello.

252
00:15:40,214 --> 00:15:44,558
Hi, I'm Ashley Anders.
And this is all about me.

253
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:47,029
I like chocolate and poetry,

254
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,448
and long walks on the beach.

255
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:54,433
I love men who can make me laugh,
and I hate mean people.

256
00:15:55,846 --> 00:16:00,954
Okay, Let's see.
Here is another one.

257
00:16:02,155 --> 00:16:04,814
So here I am walking 
my dog Rufus, like I do everyday.

258
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:09,085
- Wait a second, freeze that.
- it's one of my favorite things

259
00:16:09,962 --> 00:16:11,791
Looks like South Point Park right?

260
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,376
Yeah, where she was killed?

261
00:16:13,376 --> 00:16:15,918
Well, you gotta be 
local to recognize that.

262
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:29,024
Ashley's fanmail from within 
a hundred mile radius of from Miami.

263
00:16:29,024 --> 00:16:33,450
And these are the ones postmarked
closest to South Point Park.

264
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,150
I have twelve out of thirty 
letters here from the same perv.

265
00:16:37,427 --> 00:16:39,718
Single-spaced, teeny writing.

266
00:16:39,718 --> 00:16:43,472
I think we've got our stalker.
His name's Ned Ostroff.

267
00:16:43,472 --> 00:16:45,322
You think he licks his envelopes?

268
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:47,448
I dunno, let's ask him.

269
00:16:47,448 --> 00:16:51,963
Well, you can ask him cuz I've gotta
go to the park and look for Ashley's dog.

270
00:16:51,963 --> 00:16:55,543
There's chance it was with herwhen she was attacked.

271
00:16:55,595 --> 00:16:57,391
See you later.

272
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,603
DNA from the fan mail matches the 
semen contribution from Ashley's bed.

273
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:12,346
Contribution was neat.

274
00:17:12,346 --> 00:17:15,407
Thanks Valera. / Sure.

275
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,395
What does that mean?

276
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:24,469
That means that we have DNA proof you 
were in Ashley Ander's apartment on her bed.

277
00:17:24,469 --> 00:17:26,127
It's ridiculous.

278
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,661
I don't even know her.

279
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:29,702
Well, that much I do believe.

280
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:34,776
Neat contribution means 
there was no mixture of fluids.

281
00:17:34,776 --> 00:17:37,591
You were by yourself.

282
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:50,958
I just,

283
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,182
needed to be close to her.

284
00:17:53,182 --> 00:17:55,730
You worked in the mailroom 
at Palm Grove Industries.

285
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,827
Wasn't that close enough?

286
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,842
I did a search in human resources.

287
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:05,551
- They confirmed your employment.
- Closest I got was boxing her DVDs.

288
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,121
Shipping them.

289
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:09,548
And introducing yourself to Mr.Jeffers.

290
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:13,174
Human resources told us
that you had to be fired after that Ned.

291
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:17,422
You've got a little bit of 
a stalker personality, don't ya?

292
00:18:17,735 --> 00:18:21,221
Did Jeffers give you 
a chance to redeem yourself?

293
00:18:21,221 --> 00:18:22,167
What?

294
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:27,217
We have a recording of what appears 
to be a plan to end Ashley Ander's life.

295
00:18:27,217 --> 00:18:30,653
Did Mr. Jeffers or his lawyer talk 
you into breaking into her apartment?

296
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:32,522
I don't even know 
what you're talking about.

297
00:18:32,522 --> 00:18:34,499
Excuse me.

298
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:36,851
Horatio thought you should see this.

299
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:39,138
Had to wait for the 
bruising to come up.

300
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:41,637
Count the fingers.

301
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:44,437
Not including the thumbs,

302
00:18:44,437 --> 00:18:47,103
four on the left, three on the right.

303
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:49,900
Nine-fingered man.

304
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:53,568
Birth defect or injury?

305
00:18:53,568 --> 00:18:55,357
Well I've got all ten.

306
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:57,387
Can I go now?

307
00:18:57,483 --> 00:19:01,267
First, let's see if you've had 
one of those fingers injured.

308
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:04,350
We'll need your hand print please.

309
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:08,660
If I say yes,

310
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,205
can I see her body?

311
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:13,318
Just to say goodbye.

312
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,831
One more time.

313
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,878
We will make every 
effort to see that happen.

314
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:27,433
Roll your right sleeve please.

315
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:37,789
Down on the paper.

316
00:19:40,356 --> 00:19:42,613
Here's Ned's hand.

317
00:19:44,046 --> 00:19:47,208
And here's the killer.

318
00:19:54,617 --> 00:19:56,608
- No match.
- Are you sure?

319
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:59,177
Yeah, interdigital span's too short.

320
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:02,427
If they put someone up 
to strangle Ashley, it wasn't Ned.

321
00:20:02,427 --> 00:20:05,170
Why don't we test 
Jeffers or his lawyer?

322
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,910
Yeah, I'm working on a warrant.

323
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,376
Okay.

324
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:12,142
I'll let Horatio know about old Ned.

325
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:31,963
Got a hit on Tim Speedle, Eric Delko,

326
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:33,904
you too lieutenant.

327
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:35,707
Unidentifieds please.

328
00:20:35,707 --> 00:20:38,572
- Yes, one.
- Horatio, this is my investigation,

329
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:41,722
Joseph, are the prints in the system?

330
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,607
Carl Mercer.

331
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:45,712
Carl Mercer's one of our trustees.

332
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,756
- Jail trustee?
- That's correct.

333
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:49,414
The county uses 
them as cheap labor.

334
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,679
You have an inmate 
working in your lab?

335
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,960
Based on the latest run of 
budget cuts, I do, that's correct.

336
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,063
Do I know you?

337
00:20:58,063 --> 00:21:00,835
Yeah, I'm the guy 
you're trying to get fired.

338
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,385
I don't know what you're talking about.
I just empty the trash.

339
00:21:04,385 --> 00:21:05,647
Really?

340
00:21:05,647 --> 00:21:08,258
Let me see your forearms Carl.

341
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:12,530
Come on Carl, the forearms.

342
00:21:12,665 --> 00:21:15,489
Carl.

343
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:20,815
There it is, HCL.

344
00:21:20,815 --> 00:21:29,084
Hydrochloric acid written there by you 
to remember which acid to spill in my lab.

345
00:21:29,084 --> 00:21:31,133
This dude shows up at my wife's.

346
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:33,070
Talked like a lawyer,

347
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:37,924
she's never seen him before but 
somehow he knows I'm in for another D&D.

348
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:39,246
Offered to front the bail.

349
00:21:39,246 --> 00:21:44,529
And all you had to do was 
spill acid in the lab, right?

350
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:08,055
I hope your wife got money 
for your new charges.

351
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:09,805
No, I just spilled some stuff.

352
00:22:09,805 --> 00:22:13,232
That's an attempt to destroy 
evidence in a murder investigation.

353
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:15,568
Carl, do not feel bad.

354
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:19,587
You were played by somebody who 
understands the system better than you do

355
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:21,433
and here's the other good news.

356
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:23,566
You're not,

357
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:25,354
alone.

358
00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:27,933
H, I'll be in the layout room.

359
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:30,207
Okay Eric.

360
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,095
I suppose I owe you an apology.

361
00:22:37,095 --> 00:22:39,899
The man you need to apologize to Rick.

362
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:41,958
just left the room.

363
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,044
Thank you Carl.

364
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:49,078
Very cagey Counselor.

365
00:22:49,078 --> 00:22:50,979
Always happy to take a compliment,

366
00:22:50,979 --> 00:22:52,558
even when I don't know 
why it's been given.

367
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,069
How about bribing a trustee
to destroy evidence?

368
00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:57,093
How about that one?

369
00:22:57,093 --> 00:23:00,516
And knowing that the one thing 
HCl fumes could destroy was tape.

370
00:23:00,516 --> 00:23:03,226
You must've got an A in chemistry.

371
00:23:03,226 --> 00:23:04,534
Are you telling me,

372
00:23:04,534 --> 00:23:06,971
you lost the evidence 
you thought you had on my client?

373
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:08,940
No, not quite.

374
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,136
We actually made dupes for the 
prosecutor and for the defense.

375
00:23:12,136 --> 00:23:14,776
Without the originals 
you can't prove authenticity.

376
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:17,292
I can argue that the copied tapes 
could have been altered.

377
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:19,964
Speaking of authenticity, have a listen.

378
00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:22,335
It's under control.
The hell it is.

379
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:26,210
Take care of the Ashley 
situation or it's your ass.

380
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,913
Now the state's attorney
is going to hear that,

381
00:23:28,913 --> 00:23:32,493
and as you planning Ashley's murder.

382
00:23:32,493 --> 00:23:34,485
Not so.

383
00:23:34,485 --> 00:23:35,980
Really? Excuse me.

384
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,875
Yeah. / Just hung up 
with the trustee's wife.

385
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,569
She denies the whole thing.

386
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:42,629
- Interesting.
- She won't make a statement,

387
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,087
implicating our lawyer friend here.

388
00:23:45,087 --> 00:23:47,736
Okay, good to know.
Thank you.

389
00:23:47,736 --> 00:23:49,371
Well Counselor, you just got lucky.

390
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:51,846
The trustee's wife

391
00:23:51,846 --> 00:23:54,478
is too afraid to come forward.

392
00:23:54,478 --> 00:23:56,309
Don't you hate it when 
the truth doesn't suit you?

393
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,368
Not yet it doesn't,

394
00:23:58,368 --> 00:24:00,213
not yet.

395
00:24:09,674 --> 00:24:11,130
Rufus.

396
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,639
Rufus.

397
00:24:15,151 --> 00:24:18,262
Rufus.

398
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,818
Rufus.

399
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:24,847
Rufus!

400
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:26,593
Hey excuse me miss.

401
00:24:26,593 --> 00:24:28,610
Are we after the same thing?

402
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,097
Not today, all right?

403
00:24:30,097 --> 00:24:31,694
Just not today.

404
00:24:31,694 --> 00:24:33,104
Rufus.

405
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,845
No, it's Ashley's dog right?

406
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,104
I'm with the CSI Miami-Dade.

407
00:24:38,104 --> 00:24:41,197
We think the dog was with 
her the night she was killed.

408
00:24:41,197 --> 00:24:43,357
Ash and I are best friends.

409
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,723
Were.

410
00:24:44,723 --> 00:24:47,586
- We work together.
- You're in the...

411
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,243
I work adult.

412
00:24:49,243 --> 00:24:52,030
Soon as I heard, 
I went to Ash's place,

413
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,055
I noticed the dog was gone. / Dude,

414
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:55,459
I told you it was her.

415
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:58,830
Coquey Divine, 
you're that chick in the pornos.

416
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,526
Oh no, you guys have me 
confused with somebody else.

417
00:25:01,526 --> 00:25:03,639
No way. You're her.

418
00:25:03,639 --> 00:25:06,361
I'd recognize that tail anywhere.

419
00:25:06,361 --> 00:25:09,958
- Why don't you guys take a walk.
- What are you, her boyfriend?

420
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:12,018
- You lucky man! 
- Yeah buddy, hey hey

421
00:25:12,018 --> 00:25:14,676
how about you 
let us tap some of that.

422
00:25:14,676 --> 00:25:15,979
I'm serious, get out of here.

423
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:17,923
Yeah, why don't 
I kick your ass instead.

424
00:25:17,923 --> 00:25:19,370
How about I arrest you,

425
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,762
for harassing this young lady and 
interfering with a murder investigation,

426
00:25:22,762 --> 00:25:24,064
how about that?

427
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,626
No problem here.
We didn't mean anything, sir.

428
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,027
I'm... I'm sorry officer.

429
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,267
Get lost.

430
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:31,962
Can I have your job?

431
00:25:31,962 --> 00:25:34,949
I got into the wrong business.

432
00:25:35,553 --> 00:25:37,418
Hey, is that him?

433
00:25:38,302 --> 00:25:40,822
Rufus, hey.

434
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:42,348
No, don't do that.

435
00:25:42,348 --> 00:25:44,663
He's evidence.

436
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:51,311
He's been alone for a day.

437
00:25:51,311 --> 00:25:52,687
He's pretty brambled up.

438
00:25:52,687 --> 00:25:54,664
Oh, poor boy.

439
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,216
His ribs are sore.

440
00:25:58,216 --> 00:25:59,803
Tough old guy.

441
00:25:59,803 --> 00:26:01,516
The killer might have kicked him.

442
00:26:01,516 --> 00:26:03,456
Meaning?

443
00:26:03,456 --> 00:26:05,555
Well, maybe Rufus here,

444
00:26:05,555 --> 00:26:07,679
gave him a reason to.

445
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,999
You hold his mouth open?

446
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:21,109
You got any floss?

447
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:22,982
Are you kidding?

448
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:25,396
No.

449
00:26:28,314 --> 00:26:29,897
Let's hope that...

450
00:26:29,897 --> 00:26:32,030
he bit the guy.

451
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:36,535
Horatio?

452
00:26:36,535 --> 00:26:38,416
Yeah.

453
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:43,016
David Jeffers has a history of 
hooking up with young girls, doesn't he?

454
00:26:43,016 --> 00:26:46,630
How old is this victim?
How old do you think she is?

455
00:26:46,945 --> 00:26:49,725
Ashley's real name is 
Kathleen Sosenko.

456
00:26:49,725 --> 00:26:53,193
ID puts her 21.

457
00:26:53,193 --> 00:26:56,048
So does the birth certificate 
we got from Jeffers' office.

458
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,840
Let's check, okay?

459
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,290
Wisdom teeth don't lie.

460
00:27:05,347 --> 00:27:07,496
Third molars haven't grown in yet.

461
00:27:07,496 --> 00:27:08,891
Haven't even started.

462
00:27:08,891 --> 00:27:12,046
Don't your wisdom teeth erupt
when you're 18 years old?

463
00:27:12,046 --> 00:27:14,971
Yeah, they're last to erupt.

464
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:23,074
The molars are five centimeters 
below the gum surface.

465
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,199
She's 18 tops.

466
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:26,700
Okay.

467
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,523
So, she's been appearing in films 
3 years which mean she started at 15.

468
00:27:31,523 --> 00:27:35,603
And that is what David Jeffers is hiding

469
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:37,725
Hey. / Hey.

470
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:40,229
- What did you get?
- Found the girl's dog,

471
00:27:40,229 --> 00:27:41,999
human flesh was in his teeth.

472
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:45,116
What's the bad news? / Doesn't 
match Jeffers' or his lawyer's.

473
00:27:45,116 --> 00:27:46,333
What do we do now?

474
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,137
Go back to the park and
we take up our surveilance again.

475
00:27:49,137 --> 00:27:51,096
There are no camera 
stations in the park.

476
00:27:51,096 --> 00:27:54,632
But that doesn't mean
she's not being watched.

477
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:56,766
Why am I back here?

478
00:27:56,766 --> 00:27:58,625
You're gonna help us, Ned.

479
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:01,427
I already told you, 
I didn't do it.

480
00:28:01,427 --> 00:28:02,928
Well, first of all,

481
00:28:02,928 --> 00:28:04,657
everybody tells us they didn't do it.

482
00:28:04,657 --> 00:28:07,769
And second of all, we already 
know the things you've done.

483
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,374
And you know 
everything that Ashley did.

484
00:28:09,374 --> 00:28:11,104
You're a bona fide stalker.

485
00:28:11,104 --> 00:28:12,698
Okay,

486
00:28:12,698 --> 00:28:13,774
you've made your point.

487
00:28:13,774 --> 00:28:17,670
You saw Ashley more than 
anyone else in the last few days,

488
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:20,385
and you also have 
a breaking and entering charge

489
00:28:20,385 --> 00:28:22,866
I might be helpful with.

490
00:28:22,866 --> 00:28:25,362
I'm listening.

491
00:28:26,854 --> 00:28:29,483
The night Ashley was strangled,

492
00:28:29,483 --> 00:28:31,353
did you see this man?

493
00:28:31,353 --> 00:28:33,793
Her boss? Jeffers.

494
00:28:33,793 --> 00:28:35,840
Nah, he wasn't there.

495
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,045
Okay. / What did you see that night?

496
00:28:39,045 --> 00:28:41,151
Ashley, uh...

497
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:46,490
was wearing this ruby 
red gloss, number 6.

498
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,401
And the hoop earrings 
that her mother gave her.

499
00:28:49,401 --> 00:28:52,279
- Did you see her dog?
- Rufus hates me.

500
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,830
I keep my distance 
when he's around.

501
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:58,357
I took off when she 
started talking to some guy.

502
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:00,602
Which guy?

503
00:29:00,602 --> 00:29:04,625
- Who're you talking about?
- I hate seeing her talk to guys.

504
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:08,090
Okay. Ned, who are you 
talking about? Which guy?

505
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:11,419
I just took off. I don't know.

506
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:13,241
He was wearing a cap.

507
00:29:13,241 --> 00:29:15,866
And uh... a jacket.

508
00:29:15,866 --> 00:29:17,713
With a horseshoe on it.

509
00:29:17,713 --> 00:29:19,553
Jacket with a horseshoe?

510
00:29:19,553 --> 00:29:21,498
Okay.

511
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:28,874
A horseshoe doesn't 
really narrow it down.

512
00:29:28,874 --> 00:29:31,625
We've got everything 
from boyscout's caps to casinos.

513
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:35,267
The thing they have in common is 
they are guy related activities.

514
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:37,430
True.

515
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:42,543
There are hundreds of'em.
I don't know where to start.

516
00:29:42,543 --> 00:29:47,972
Maybe we can cross-reference 
it with her fan mail, we might get lucky.

517
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:52,277
Maybe we just did.

518
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,606
What if we're not looking 
for a horseshoe?

519
00:29:57,606 --> 00:29:59,341
The Greek letter omega.

520
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:01,479
And I've seen it recently.

521
00:30:03,436 --> 00:30:05,938
I remembered reading this fan letter.

522
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:07,354
It's a well thought out,

523
00:30:07,354 --> 00:30:12,097
and respectful letter requesting Ashley's 
presence at the fraternity's rotherhood night.

524
00:30:12,097 --> 00:30:14,110
Did she go? / No,

525
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,656
she made a note 
to herself she'd sign the DVD.

526
00:30:17,656 --> 00:30:20,490
Check out who the 
chapter vice president is.

527
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,149
Kyle Preston.

528
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:24,817
The same guy 
who found Ashley's body.

529
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,900
This is a place of business, Kyle.

530
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,096
So? / Take off the hat.

531
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:37,167
Eric will hang it for you.

532
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:42,293
Go pick it up on you're way out.

533
00:30:42,293 --> 00:30:43,518
What do you doing with my hat?

534
00:30:43,518 --> 00:30:47,138
Why didn't you tell me 
you recognized Ashley, Kyle?

535
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:49,654
- The dead girl?
- Mhm, the dead girl.

536
00:30:49,654 --> 00:30:52,461
The one you wrote the letter to.

537
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,260
Look. You write 
a letter to every pornstar

538
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,087
hoping that just one 
say's she'll show up.

539
00:30:57,087 --> 00:30:59,772
I mean, you've gotta get in it to win it.

540
00:30:59,772 --> 00:31:01,572
Clever.

541
00:31:01,572 --> 00:31:03,179
Let me see your leg.

542
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:06,417
- What for?
- Let me see it.

543
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:16,848
Okay. Before you lie 
to me about that, Kyle

544
00:31:16,848 --> 00:31:24,436
you should know that I have Ashley's 
dog who has human flesh in his teeth.

545
00:31:24,436 --> 00:31:28,426
Now, do I need to give you a DNA test?

546
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:31,856
Okay, look, I saw her that afternoon.

547
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:36,067
My girl friend was in class, and I...
I thought I just go talk to her.

548
00:31:38,825 --> 00:31:40,152
Miss Anders?

549
00:31:40,152 --> 00:31:41,564
Yes?

550
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:43,035
You don't know me but uh...

551
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:44,832
I'm huge fan.

552
00:31:44,832 --> 00:31:46,177
Rufus, down.

553
00:31:46,177 --> 00:31:47,431
Sorry.

554
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:48,688
No, that's okay.

555
00:31:48,688 --> 00:31:50,497
But I was wondering...

556
00:31:50,497 --> 00:31:52,915
You want an autograph?

557
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,251
The dog bit me.

558
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:59,299
Why didn't you tell me this before?

559
00:32:00,816 --> 00:32:04,741
Because my girl friend 
hates that I watch porn.

560
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,210
And to tell you the truth,
I'm not proud of it either.

561
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,983
Did Kyle have something 
to do with that girl's death?

562
00:32:11,983 --> 00:32:16,964
Is there anything you wanna tell me 
that may help us answer that question?

563
00:32:16,964 --> 00:32:22,023
The second I heard she was 
a porn star, alarms went off.

564
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,593
For Kyle,

565
00:32:24,593 --> 00:32:26,966
watching it kinda got out of control.

566
00:32:26,966 --> 00:32:28,630
Did you ever watch it together?

567
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,311
Dorm parties.

568
00:32:30,311 --> 00:32:32,901
But he wanted me to watch them on...

569
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:34,754
with him...

570
00:32:34,754 --> 00:32:36,559
we...

571
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:40,202
- you know.
- And you said no.

572
00:32:41,677 --> 00:32:45,114
I've been upset.

573
00:32:45,114 --> 00:32:47,988
We never...

574
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:51,745
This is embarassing.

575
00:32:56,534 --> 00:32:57,602
He... uh...

576
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:59,517
couldn't

577
00:32:59,517 --> 00:33:03,204
anymore with me.

578
00:33:04,695 --> 00:33:07,065
That's called porn creep.

579
00:33:07,065 --> 00:33:12,329
It get's to be so like 
I can't be with a real woman anymore.

580
00:33:13,563 --> 00:33:17,069
I thought he got past it,

581
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:19,169
grow out of it.

582
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:21,137
So did you

583
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:23,989
maybe take matters 
into your own hands?

584
00:33:23,989 --> 00:33:26,588
Killed her?

585
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,400
No.

586
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,357
Why would you even think that?

587
00:33:30,357 --> 00:33:35,013
Well, because Ashley 
wasn't sexually assaulted.

588
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:41,096
The muder was personal,
but not sexual.

589
00:33:41,096 --> 00:33:42,335
This is great.

590
00:33:42,335 --> 00:33:45,874
He's into porn, 
but I'm the suspect.

591
00:34:12,493 --> 00:34:13,792
So?

592
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:16,468
The nectar's consistent with 
the samples from the crime scene.

593
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:17,552
Good.

594
00:34:17,552 --> 00:34:19,120
Run with it, Eric.

595
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,186
You're not going?

596
00:34:20,186 --> 00:34:23,725
No, I have some unfinished 
business but you go for it.

597
00:34:23,725 --> 00:34:25,587
All right.

598
00:34:25,587 --> 00:34:27,972
Thanks for having my back, H.

599
00:34:27,972 --> 00:34:29,997
Always.

600
00:34:32,231 --> 00:34:34,063
Got a time problem, Kyle.

601
00:34:34,063 --> 00:34:36,975
Why, I got nowhere to be.

602
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:41,581
But you said you spoke to Ashley 
in the afternoon, correct?

603
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:42,707
Yup.

604
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:44,853
And then you found 
her body at 6:00 AM?

605
00:34:44,853 --> 00:34:47,869
After sunrise? 
You see the thing is ...

606
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:51,385
the nectar we found 
on your hat is from a moonflower,

607
00:34:51,385 --> 00:34:53,665
which blooms only at night.

608
00:34:53,665 --> 00:34:58,338
Photosynthetic reaction makes 
it open when the sun is down.

609
00:35:01,681 --> 00:35:04,184
Must've got it on me when I found her.

610
00:35:04,184 --> 00:35:07,918
You said you never touched her
and your girlfriend corroborated that.

611
00:35:07,918 --> 00:35:11,240
That's one true thing you told us.

612
00:35:16,183 --> 00:35:18,568
Thanks.

613
00:35:19,188 --> 00:35:21,608
What happened to your finger?

614
00:35:21,608 --> 00:35:24,136
Jammed it playing bascketball.

615
00:35:24,136 --> 00:35:25,913
It... it doesn't bend.

616
00:35:25,913 --> 00:35:28,852
I went from starter to bench.

617
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:31,533
Prison.

618
00:35:31,728 --> 00:35:33,491
You killed Ashley.

619
00:35:33,491 --> 00:35:36,151
You strangled her.

620
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:43,741
Ashley, in her movies

621
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,156
she was always ready to go.

622
00:35:46,156 --> 00:35:50,177
Eyes were on the back of her head.

623
00:35:50,177 --> 00:35:52,715
But Gina...

624
00:35:52,715 --> 00:35:56,361
she would look at me.

625
00:35:56,993 --> 00:35:59,150
It was nothing like pornos.

626
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,550
You didn't know how to react.

627
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,545
I was losing my girl friend.

628
00:36:07,772 --> 00:36:09,343
Ashley.

629
00:36:09,343 --> 00:36:12,109
- Uh... yeah.
- Ashley Anders, right?

630
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:13,344
Yeah?

631
00:36:13,344 --> 00:36:15,917
I was a big fan.

632
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:17,518
Thanks, I'm...

633
00:36:17,518 --> 00:36:19,205
I am just... / Don't talk.

634
00:36:19,205 --> 00:36:20,948
But I'm... / Don't freakin talk!

635
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:44,807
So what, you figured if you kill Ashley, 
you'd kill your problem?

636
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:48,379
I love Gina.

637
00:36:48,984 --> 00:36:50,820
I just needed to be rewired.

638
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,720
That's why you brought her out there.

639
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,853
For a little victory sex?

640
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:13,334
It didn't matter.

641
00:37:13,793 --> 00:37:17,768
Real girls don't turn me on anymore.

642
00:37:18,419 --> 00:37:22,174
Fortunately, for you, where you're 
going that won't be a problem.

643
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:28,888
Ashley's birth certificate's 
been tampered with.

644
00:37:28,888 --> 00:37:32,394
Paper's been chemically treated 
probably with bleach.

645
00:37:32,394 --> 00:37:36,181
So somebody erased 
the date and then changed it.

646
00:37:38,246 --> 00:37:40,089
The thing about bleach is

647
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:44,959
it can take some things away, 
but leaves others behind.

648
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:52,656
I didn't know she was under age,
when she made those movies.

649
00:37:52,656 --> 00:37:54,356
No but when you sold the movies,

650
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:55,993
you did,

651
00:37:55,993 --> 00:37:58,155
and that's what the conversations 
on the tape was about,

652
00:37:58,155 --> 00:38:01,643
your plans to sell Ashley's films.

653
00:38:01,643 --> 00:38:05,839
I checked with the Florida UCC filings 
and found out that Palm Grove Industries,

654
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,000
has sold Fallen Films 
to a Korean company.

655
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,318
Just this week.

656
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:11,990
And that's why you 
doctored her birth certificate.

657
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,070
Right?

658
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,265
We found your finger 
prints on the paper.

659
00:38:18,265 --> 00:38:22,725
That's felony distribution 
of child pornography.

660
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:26,784
That's 15 years minimum.

661
00:38:26,922 --> 00:38:28,352
15 ...

662
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:33,040
was Ashley's age 
when you started exploiting her.

663
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:36,925
Even if I had an idea
I'm not the bad guy here,

664
00:38:36,925 --> 00:38:39,679
I didn't kill anyone.

665
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:42,832
No.

666
00:38:42,832 --> 00:38:44,652
But...

667
00:38:44,652 --> 00:38:47,272
you created the bad guy.

668
00:39:07,103 --> 00:39:09,658
Snob.

669
00:39:11,259 --> 00:39:13,357
Talking to me?

670
00:39:13,357 --> 00:39:15,541
I'm Ashley's friend.

671
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:17,152
You don't remember me?

672
00:39:17,152 --> 00:39:18,652
Coquey Divine.

673
00:39:18,652 --> 00:39:20,439
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
You looked different.

674
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:21,770
Make up.

675
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:24,345
You saw me right after a shoot.

676
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:27,242
I just wanted to thank you for

677
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:29,493
how you dealt with 
those guys in the park.

678
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,103
Sticking up for me.

679
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:32,921
Sure. / I mean...

680
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:35,787
I know you had to and all, but

681
00:39:35,787 --> 00:39:40,054
- No, I didn't have to.
- Come on, it was the badge talking.

682
00:39:40,054 --> 00:39:44,466
You're telling me some other night with friends,
you wouldn't have said the same things?

683
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:46,299
No.

684
00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:50,141
May be not, but 
you would have thought it.

685
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,962
I don't mean to insult you...

686
00:39:52,962 --> 00:39:56,942
but I haven't seen 
any of your movies.

687
00:39:56,942 --> 00:40:00,467
So you'd date a girl like me?

688
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:06,804
Officially no, because you're 
a material witness of mine.

689
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:10,720
So cute, when guys 
hide behind roles.

690
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,389
But we both know that 
I'm not exactly the kind of a girl

691
00:40:13,389 --> 00:40:16,254
to bring home to mom.

692
00:40:16,683 --> 00:40:18,283
Coquey you're...

693
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:21,383
you're a nice girl.

694
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,736
It's okay.

695
00:40:23,736 --> 00:40:25,525
Really...

696
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:28,486
But if you ever wanted 
to get together for

697
00:40:28,486 --> 00:40:31,690
like coffee.

698
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,446
My real name is Sarah.

699
00:40:33,446 --> 00:40:35,008
Sarah Pfeiffer.

700
00:40:35,008 --> 00:40:36,768
Sarah.

701
00:41:00,817 --> 00:41:02,225
Congratulations.

702
00:41:02,225 --> 00:41:04,730
Bag the porn king, 
his lawyer, and the killer.

703
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,165
It's not bad week's work.

704
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:07,868
I guess it is not 
a good week for you, Rick

705
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:10,201
unless you arrested a police offcer, uh?

706
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,095
It isn't my job to be liked.

707
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,615
Mission accomplished.

708
00:41:13,615 --> 00:41:18,024
Look, my personal feelings may have 
clouded my judgement on the HAZ-MAT thing,

709
00:41:18,024 --> 00:41:19,318
I'll admit that.

710
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:21,476
Fair enough.

711
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,704
There she is.

712
00:41:22,704 --> 00:41:24,176
You're ready? / Yup!

713
00:41:24,176 --> 00:41:26,599
Champagne's on ice.

714
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:28,984
Sounds great.

715
00:41:29,663 --> 00:41:32,427
I'll wait for you in the car.

716
00:41:33,217 --> 00:41:35,797
Nothing?

717
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,197
Well, the truth is

718
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:41,115
she hates champagne.

719
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:42,561
And you're telling me this because...?

720
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:46,417
I'm telling you this because 
she deserves to be happy.

721
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:48,531
So have fun tonight.

722
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:50,595
Thank you.

723
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,020
Seal 'Love's Devine'

724
00:41:53,020 --> 00:42:03,124
I had lost all of my belief you see

725
00:42:04,277 --> 00:42:11,782
And realize my mistake

726
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:17,304
But time

727
00:42:17,304 --> 00:42:23,570
through a prayer to me

728
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:31,904
And all around me became still

729
00:42:31,904 --> 00:42:35,068
I need love

730
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:37,356
love's divine

731
00:42:37,356 --> 00:42:41,703
Please forgive me 
now I see that I've been blind

732
00:42:41,703 --> 00:42:44,339
Give me love

733
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:47,115
loves is what I need to help me

734
00:42:47,115 --> 00:42:51,221
know my name

735
00:42:54,956 --> 00:43:01,168
Through the rainstorm came sanctuary

736
00:43:04,739 --> 00:43:11,831
And I felt my spirit fly

737
00:43:11,831 --> 00:43:21,697
I had found all of my reality

738
00:43:24,265 --> 00:43:31,119
I realize what it takes

739
00:43:31,727 --> 00:43:34,119
'Cause I need love

740
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:37,407
love's divine

741
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:41,712
Please forgive me 
now I see that I've been blind

742
00:43:41,712 --> 00:43:44,266
Give me love

743
00:43:44,266 --> 00:43:47,822
loves is what I need to help me

744
00:43:47,822 --> 00:43:51,409
know my name

745
00:43:54,308 --> 00:44:01,090
Love can help me know my name
