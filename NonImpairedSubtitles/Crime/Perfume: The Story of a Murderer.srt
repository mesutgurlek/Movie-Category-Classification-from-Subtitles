6
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:33,974
Quick! We can't
hold him back much longer.

7
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:38,278
Hurry!

8
00:01:41,532 --> 00:01:42,806
Come on!

9
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,474
Quick!

10
00:01:56,322 --> 00:01:57,379
Faster!

11
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,594
Up on the balcony!
Come on! Quickly!

12
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:41,251
Just read them
the sentence!

13
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,868
The sentence of the court...

14
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:47,995
is that in two days hence...

15
00:02:48,491 --> 00:02:52,528
the perfumer journeyman:
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille...

16
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:55,353
shall be bound
to a wooden cross...

17
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:58,567
with his face raised
towards heaven!

18
00:03:00,024 --> 00:03:02,136
And whilst still alive...

19
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,355
be dealt twelve blows
with an iron rod...

20
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:11,487
breaking the joints
of his arms...

21
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:13,595
his shoulders...

22
00:03:14,357 --> 00:03:15,687
his hips...

23
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,073
his legs!

24
00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:23,369
He shall then be raised up
to hang until dead.

25
00:03:23,883 --> 00:03:27,043
And all customary acts of mercy...

26
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:30,061
are expressly forbidden
the executioner.

27
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:40,903
In 18th century France...

28
00:03:41,004 --> 00:03:46,911
there lived a man who was one of the most gifted
and notorious personages of his time.

29
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:50,273
His name was
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.

30
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:55,074
And if his name has been forgotten today,
it is for the sole reason...

31
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:57,989
that his entire ambition
was restricted to a domain...

32
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,738
that leaves no trace in history:

33
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:08,078
to the fleeting realm of scent.

34
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,650
PERFUME
The Story of a Murderer

35
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:23,264
In the period of which we speak...

36
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:28,883
there reigned in the cities a stench
barely conceivable to us modern men and women.

37
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,932
Naturally, the stench
was foulest in Paris...

38
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:35,908
for Paris was
the largest city in Europe.

39
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,638
And nowhere in Paris was that stench
more profoundly repugnant...

40
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:41,923
than in the city's fish market.

41
00:04:43,486 --> 00:04:46,767
Here we are.
I'll get another box.

42
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:51,418
It was here then,
on the most putrid spot in the whole kingdom...

43
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:54,042
that Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was born...

44
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:56,838
on the 17th of July, 1738.

45
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:22,078
It was his mother's fifth birth.

46
00:05:22,427 --> 00:05:25,117
She delivered them all here
under her fish stand.

47
00:05:25,221 --> 00:05:27,768
And all had been stillbirths,
or semi-stillbirths.

48
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:28,942
Are you alright?

49
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:32,411
And by evening, the whole mess
had been shoveled away...

50
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:34,201
with the fish guts
into the river.

51
00:05:34,953 --> 00:05:36,851
It would be much the same today...

52
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,058
but then...

53
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:42,459
Jean-Baptiste chose differently.

54
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:16,044
What's that noise?

55
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:18,475
It's... it's a baby.

56
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:19,782
What's going on here?

57
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:26,402
- It's a newborn.
- Where's his mother?

58
00:06:27,852 --> 00:06:29,060
She was just here.

59
00:06:31,534 --> 00:06:36,710
She tried to kill it, her own child.
She tried to kill a baby!

60
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:40,125
There! There she is!

61
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:42,841
- Stop! Stop where you are!
- Murderer!

62
00:06:42,926 --> 00:06:46,454
Thus, the first sound
to escape Grenouille's lips...

63
00:06:47,037 --> 00:06:48,715
sent his mother
to the gallows.

64
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:55,057
And Jean-Baptiste,
by official order...

65
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,235
to the orphange
of Madame Gaillard.

66
00:07:01,317 --> 00:07:06,297
- How many today?
- Four, well... three and a half.

67
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:15,644
- As usual, more dead than alive.
- Just take the money and sign!

68
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:26,173
- Make room!
- Where?

69
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,113
Move!

70
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:42,856
Is he dead?

71
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:12,329
- That's not staying in my bed.
- Let's throw it out then.

72
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:16,201
- What if it screams?
- It's just a kiddie.

73
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:36,704
Harder! Push!

74
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:40,268
What are you doing?

75
00:08:48,242 --> 00:08:49,107
For Madame Gaillard...

76
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:52,226
Grenouille was a source of income
just like any other.

77
00:08:52,956 --> 00:08:58,594
The children, however, sensed at once
that there was something different about him.

78
00:09:14,493 --> 00:09:18,875
By the age of five, Jean-Baptiste
still could not talk.

79
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:24,410
But he had been born with a talent
that made him unique among their kind.

80
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:27,311
It was not that the other children
hated him...

81
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:30,880
they felt unnerved
by him.

82
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,726
Increasingly, he became aware
that his phenomenal sense of smell...

83
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:41,170
was a gift that had been give to him...

84
00:10:41,546 --> 00:10:43,135
and him alone.

85
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:54,462
When Jean-Baptiste did
finally learn to speak...

86
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,781
he soon found
that everyday language...

87
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,971
proved inadequate for all the olfactory experience
he's accumulating within himself.

88
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:07,618
Wood.

89
00:11:13,308 --> 00:11:14,602
Warm wood.

90
00:11:15,923 --> 00:11:19,645
Grass... wet grass.

91
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:23,844
Stones... warm stones.

92
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:30,903
Water... cold water.

93
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,354
Frog.

94
00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:42,548
Wet stones.

95
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:46,733
Big wet frog stones.

96
00:11:48,303 --> 00:11:49,836
Something...

97
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:54,670
something, something.

98
00:11:56,112 --> 00:12:00,782
By the age of thirteen, Madame Gaillard
no longer had room for Jean-Baptiste...

99
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:02,591
and therefore decided
to sell him.

100
00:12:02,592 --> 00:12:03,753
Come on!

101
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,017
Ten francs.

102
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:13,004
From his first breath
of the odor enveloping this man...

103
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:15,165
Seven, it's not worth so much.

104
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:18,425
Grenouille knew that his life
in Grimal's tannery...

105
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,075
would be worth precisely
as much...

106
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,915
as the work
he could accomplish.

107
00:12:25,318 --> 00:12:27,107
Unfortunately for Madame Gaillard...

108
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:33,367
the bargain was short-lived.

109
00:12:39,215 --> 00:12:42,594
Life expectancy in the tannery
was a mere five years.

110
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:47,000
But Jean-Baptiste proved to be
as tough as a resilient bacterium.

111
00:12:47,813 --> 00:12:49,482
He adjusted to
his new fate...

112
00:12:49,483 --> 00:12:52,494
and became a paragon
of docility and diligence...

113
00:12:52,797 --> 00:12:56,781
slaved 15, 16 hours a day,
summer and winter.

114
00:12:58,173 --> 00:13:02,508
Gradually, he became aware
of a world beyond the tannery...

115
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:07,851
where utopia of unexplored smells
lay in store for him.

116
00:13:31,314 --> 00:13:32,361
Grenouille.

117
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,349
Come with us.
I'm taking you to town for delivery.

118
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:44,659
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille
had triumphed. He was alive.

119
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,480
And at last, he was in his element.

120
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,867
He was not choosing.

121
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:31,131
He did not differentiate between
what is commonly considered to be...

122
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:33,193
good smells from bad.

123
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:37,294
At least, not yet.

124
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:41,637
He was very greedy.

125
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:43,936
The goal was to possess...

126
00:14:43,993 --> 00:14:47,363
everything the world had to offer
in the way of odors.

127
00:14:48,094 --> 00:14:52,046
His only condition being...
that they were new ones.

128
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:58,237
Thousands upon thousands of odors
formed an invisible gruel...

129
00:14:58,378 --> 00:15:02,602
which he dissected into its
smallest and most remote parts of pieces.

130
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:19,976
Grenouille!

131
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:25,239
Come on!

132
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,722
Your ass over here.

133
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,175
- What is it called?
- "Amor and Psyche", madame.

134
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:47,008
My little creation.

135
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:51,650
- May I try it?
- If you allow me, mademoiselle.

136
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:01,463
Sheer heaven...

137
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:07,851
Monsieur P¨¦lissier, you are
truly an artiste.

138
00:19:30,597 --> 00:19:31,812
What do you want?

139
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:41,772
Want to buy some?

140
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:56,357
Two for a sou.

141
00:25:54,005 --> 00:25:55,716
That's for you
running off like that.

142
00:25:56,493 --> 00:25:57,661
I'll kill you!

143
00:26:01,328 --> 00:26:04,041
That night, he could not sleep.

144
00:26:04,908 --> 00:26:09,373
The intoxicating power of the girls's scent
suddenly made it clear to him...

145
00:26:09,426 --> 00:26:13,574
why he had come to his own life
so tenaciously, so savagely.

146
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:16,464
The meaning and purpose...

147
00:26:16,556 --> 00:26:19,461
of his miserable existence
had a higher destiny.

148
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,548
He would learn
how to preserve scent...

149
00:26:23,764 --> 00:26:27,943
so that never again would he lose
such sublime beauty.

150
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,685
There were about a dozen perfumers
in Paris in those days.

151
00:26:55,699 --> 00:27:00,047
One of them, the one celebrated
Italian perfumer, Giuseppe Baldini,

152
00:27:00,138 --> 00:27:02,132
had set up shop
in the center of the bridge,

153
00:27:02,198 --> 00:27:06,580
called "the Pont au Change" on his arrival
in Paris over thirty years ago.

154
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:09,893
To be sure,
at one time in his youth,

155
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:15,028
Baldini had created several truly great perfumes
to which he owed his fortune.

156
00:27:16,786 --> 00:27:21,284
But now, Baldini was out of touch,
out of fashion,

157
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,465
and spent his days
waiting for customers that no longer came.

158
00:27:27,194 --> 00:27:29,075
- Ch¨¦nier! There you are!
- Monsieur Baldini.

159
00:27:29,076 --> 00:27:30,380
Put on your wig.

160
00:27:30,956 --> 00:27:32,372
Put on your wig!

161
00:27:34,728 --> 00:27:35,692
You going out?

162
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:38,526
I will retire to my study
for a few hours,

163
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,232
and do not want to be disturbed
under any circumstances.

164
00:27:41,336 --> 00:27:43,349
Will you be creating
a new perfume, Monsieur Baldini?

165
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,646
Correct.
For Count Verhamont.

166
00:27:46,156 --> 00:27:48,485
He's asked for something like...

167
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:52,431
I think he said it was called...
"Amor and Psyche"?

168
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,071
That swindler in the
rue Saint-Andr¨¦-des-Arts.

169
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:58,658
- P¨¦lissier.
- P¨¦lissier! That's him.

170
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,544
"Amor and Psyche"ê.

171
00:28:06,277 --> 00:28:08,221
- Do you know it?
- Oh, yes.

172
00:28:08,305 --> 00:28:10,300
You can smell it everywhere
these days, monsieur.

173
00:28:11,216 --> 00:28:12,522
Every street corner.

174
00:28:14,015 --> 00:28:17,285
In fact, I just purchased
you a sample.

175
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:20,876
In case you wanted
to test it.

176
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:26,524
What on earth makes you think
I'd be interested in testing it?

177
00:28:28,213 --> 00:28:30,531
You're right.
It's nothing special.

178
00:28:31,144 --> 00:28:33,821
Actually, it's a very
common scent.

179
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:37,435
I believe the head cord
contains lime oil.

180
00:28:39,138 --> 00:28:42,332
Really? And the heart cord?

181
00:28:42,984 --> 00:28:45,242
Orange blossom, I believe.

182
00:28:45,774 --> 00:28:50,111
And civet in the base cord,
but I cannot say for sure.

183
00:28:50,273 --> 00:28:53,980
Well, I couldn't care less what that bungler
P¨¦lissier slops into his perfumes.

184
00:28:54,338 --> 00:28:55,600
Naturally not, monsieur.

185
00:28:56,126 --> 00:28:59,350
And I am thinking of creating something
for Count Verhamont...

186
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:02,983
that will cause
a veritable sensation.

187
00:29:03,294 --> 00:29:05,066
I'm sure it will, Monsieur Baldini.

188
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:10,159
Take charge of the shop, Ch¨¦nier.
And don't let anyone come near me.

189
00:29:10,273 --> 00:29:13,283
Inspiration requires
peace and tranquility.

190
00:29:14,406 --> 00:29:17,215
Vanessa! Bring me the handkerchiefs!

191
00:29:46,572 --> 00:29:47,976
Here are your handkerchiefs.

192
00:29:48,105 --> 00:29:50,697
Grazie... grazie... grazie!

193
00:29:53,483 --> 00:29:55,378
Is there anything else
you need?

194
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:58,140
Inspiration, perhaps.

195
00:29:58,401 --> 00:29:59,791
Come on, Giuseppe!

196
00:30:02,112 --> 00:30:05,111
You're still
the great perfumer Baldini.

197
00:30:56,631 --> 00:30:59,479
Bellissimo...
Wonderful...

198
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:05,076
He did it again.

199
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:14,108
Lime oil, yes indeed.

200
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,180
Orange blossom, to be sure.

201
00:31:24,264 --> 00:31:26,274
And a hint of cloves, perhaps.

202
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,457
No...

203
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:32,556
Well, could be cinnamon.

204
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:35,748
It's gone.

205
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:40,500
Cinnamon.

206
00:31:41,386 --> 00:31:42,757
It's not cinnamon...

207
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,599
Cloves.

208
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:48,570
No...

209
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:50,466
Musk?

210
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,636
No.

211
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,402
Who's there?

212
00:32:32,134 --> 00:32:33,613
I'm from Grimal's tannery.

213
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,153
I've brought
the goatskins you ordered.

214
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,028
Follow me.

215
00:32:52,064 --> 00:32:53,250
This way.

216
00:33:26,097 --> 00:33:28,819
There. Leave them there.

217
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:39,425
Tell your master
the skins are fine.

218
00:33:39,945 --> 00:33:42,205
I'll come by the next few days
and pay for them.

219
00:33:43,353 --> 00:33:44,723
Yes, monsieur.

220
00:33:50,835 --> 00:33:53,721
You want to make this leather
smell good, don't you?

221
00:33:55,092 --> 00:34:00,202
- Why, of course.
- With "Amor and Psyche" by P¨¦lissier?

222
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:07,917
Whatever gave you the absurb idea
I would use someone else's perfume?

223
00:34:09,052 --> 00:34:09,879
It's all over you.

224
00:34:10,351 --> 00:34:12,616
It's on your forehead,
your nose, your hands.

225
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:17,428
It's bad, "Amor and Psyche" is, master.
There's too much rosemary in it, and too much of...

226
00:34:19,093 --> 00:34:21,237
that and that.

227
00:34:23,905 --> 00:34:27,399
Bergamot and patchouli.

228
00:34:27,454 --> 00:34:28,465
Pa...

229
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:31,756
- Patchouli.
- Patchou...

230
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,031
What else?

231
00:34:41,036 --> 00:34:42,511
That and that.

232
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:45,586
That and that.

233
00:34:54,745 --> 00:34:56,183
Orange blossom.

234
00:34:57,766 --> 00:34:58,856
Lime.

235
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,562
- Musk.
- Musk.

236
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:06,247
And cloves.

237
00:35:06,561 --> 00:35:08,068
And this.

238
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:18,927
- Storax?
- That's in it too.

239
00:35:19,002 --> 00:35:21,803
- Storax. Storax.
- Storax. Storax.

240
00:35:28,243 --> 00:35:30,889
You have, it appears,
a fine nose, young man. But...

241
00:35:30,948 --> 00:35:34,757
My nose knows all the smells in the world.
It's the best nose in Paris.

242
00:35:34,944 --> 00:35:37,196
Only I don't know the names.
I need to learn the names...

243
00:35:37,229 --> 00:35:39,049
- learn them all...
- No! No! No! Basta!

244
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,872
You don't interrupt me when I'm speaking.

245
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:43,170
You're both impertinent
and insolent!

246
00:35:44,129 --> 00:35:46,434
Even I don't know every scent.

247
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:51,855
I, of course, know for some time
the ingredients of "Amor and Psyche".

248
00:35:51,856 --> 00:35:55,792
But all it needs to find that out
is a passably fine nose, nothing else.

249
00:35:57,766 --> 00:36:00,983
But it needs the craft
of a true perfumer...

250
00:36:01,813 --> 00:36:03,607
to detect the exact formula.

251
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:08,442
Which notes, which cords.
And in what precise measurements.

252
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,849
Could you tell me the exact formula
of "Amor and Psyche"ê?

253
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,115
"Best nose in Paris".

254
00:36:22,439 --> 00:36:23,786
Speak up!

255
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:27,732
You see, you can't, can you?
And I'll tell you why.

256
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:31,516
Because talent means
next to nothing!

257
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:36,151
While experience, acquired in humility...

258
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:39,938
and hard work, means everything.

259
00:36:44,194 --> 00:36:46,665
I don't, I don't know
what a formula is.

260
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:49,697
But I can make
"Amor and Psyche" for you now.

261
00:36:50,984 --> 00:36:54,058
And you think I'll just let you
slop around in my laboratory...

262
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,053
with essential oils
that are worth a fortune?

263
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:57,300
You?

264
00:36:58,406 --> 00:37:00,821
- Yes.
- Now pay attention!

265
00:37:04,072 --> 00:37:05,481
What is your name, anyway?

266
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,117
Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.

267
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:14,243
Very well, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.

268
00:37:15,996 --> 00:37:19,271
You shall have the opportunity now,
this very moment, to prove your assertion.

269
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:22,360
Your grandiose failure will also be
an opportunity for you to learn...

270
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,597
- the virture of humility.
- How much do you want me to make?

271
00:37:25,647 --> 00:37:29,037
- How much of... what?
- How much "Amor and Psyche" do you want?

272
00:37:31,737 --> 00:37:35,567
- Shall I fill this flask?
- No! You shall not!

273
00:37:44,544 --> 00:37:47,106
- You may fill this one.
- Yes, master.

274
00:37:50,025 --> 00:37:52,154
- But, Master Baldini,
- Hmm?

275
00:37:52,498 --> 00:37:55,060
you must let me do it
in my own way.

276
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,277
As you please.

277
00:38:03,508 --> 00:38:05,747
Don't drop that!
That's pure alcohol!

278
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:07,961
You want to blow up
the entire building?

279
00:38:10,403 --> 00:38:12,032
You have to measure it first!

280
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:02,356
Stop! Stop it!
That's enough! Basta!

281
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:03,975
You know nothing!

282
00:39:04,446 --> 00:39:08,945
Essential oils are always to be
mixed first, then the alcohol added.

283
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,125
And never ever let this perfume
to be shaken like that.

284
00:39:12,411 --> 00:39:15,597
I must've been insane
to listen to your asinine gibberish.

285
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,015
Yes, we're done.

286
00:39:47,645 --> 00:39:49,275
Mamamiya...

287
00:40:03,094 --> 00:40:05,324
This is "Amor and Psyche".

288
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:08,384
But it's not a good perfume, master.

289
00:40:09,898 --> 00:40:13,251
If you let me again, master,
I'll make it more better.

290
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:27,386
That's a really good perfume.

291
00:41:34,006 --> 00:41:36,116
Don't you want
to smell it, master?

292
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:37,923
I'm not in the mood
to test it now.

293
00:41:37,972 --> 00:41:40,665
I have other things
on my mind. Go now.

294
00:41:42,453 --> 00:41:44,884
- But, master...
- Go now!

295
00:41:59,524 --> 00:42:02,424
Can't I come to work
for you, master, can't I?

296
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:06,598
- Let me think about it.
- Master!

297
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:11,215
I have to learn
how to keep smell.

298
00:42:12,643 --> 00:42:16,862
- What?
- Can you teach me that?

299
00:42:17,378 --> 00:42:19,561
I shall have to think
about it. Now go.

300
00:43:04,058 --> 00:43:05,572
I love you.

301
00:43:11,844 --> 00:43:14,277
I'll give you 50 francs for him.

302
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:22,888
Grenouille!

303
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:26,631
Grimal's transaction had
a profound effect on all three parties.

304
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:27,711
Hey, watch out!

305
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:34,270
Now at least, upon
Monsieur Grimal himself.

306
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,731
As for Giuseppe Baldini,

307
00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:43,323
the acquisition of Grenouille miraculously
transformed his dwindling business,

308
00:43:43,389 --> 00:43:46,215
even surpassing
its former glory.

309
00:43:53,938 --> 00:43:55,994
While at last, for Jean-Baptiste,

310
00:43:56,308 --> 00:44:00,879
the mysterious secret
of the perfumers' craft began to unfold.

311
00:44:06,988 --> 00:44:09,470
Now, pay careful attention
to what I tell you.

312
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,988
Just like a musical cord,

313
00:44:11,046 --> 00:44:14,799
a perfume cord contains
four essences, or notes,

314
00:44:14,858 --> 00:44:17,985
carefully selected
for their harmonic affinity.

315
00:44:18,042 --> 00:44:23,286
Each perfume contains three cords:
the head, the heart and the base,

316
00:44:23,323 --> 00:44:25,872
necessitating twelve notes in all.

317
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:29,370
The head cord contains
the first impression,

318
00:44:29,428 --> 00:44:32,892
lasting only a few minutes,
before giving way to the heart cord:

319
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:36,546
the theme of the perfume,
lasting several hours.

320
00:44:36,584 --> 00:44:39,207
Finally, the base cord:

321
00:44:39,527 --> 00:44:43,218
the trail of the perfume,
lasting several days.

322
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,209
Mind you, the ancient Egyptians believed
that one can only create a truly original perfume...

323
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:58,644
by adding an extra note,
one final essence that will ring out...

324
00:44:59,134 --> 00:45:01,292
and dominate the others.

325
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:07,872
Legend has it that a jar
was once found in a pharaoh's tomb.

326
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:11,495
And when it was opened,
a perfume was released.

327
00:45:11,615 --> 00:45:14,515
After all those thousands of years,

328
00:45:14,575 --> 00:45:18,481
a perfume of such subtle beauty,
and yet such power,

329
00:45:18,571 --> 00:45:21,391
that for one single moment,

330
00:45:21,447 --> 00:45:25,870
every single person on earth
believed they were in paradise.

331
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:30,175
Twelve essences
could be identified.

332
00:45:31,158 --> 00:45:34,856
But the thirteenth,
the vital one...

333
00:45:36,313 --> 00:45:38,409
could never be determined.

334
00:45:40,121 --> 00:45:40,936
Why not?

335
00:45:43,342 --> 00:45:43,922
Why not??

336
00:45:44,144 --> 00:45:45,677
What do you mean why not?

337
00:45:46,847 --> 00:45:49,335
Because it's a legend, numskull.

338
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:51,723
What's a legend?

339
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:55,211
Never mind.

340
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:38,226
Jean-Baptiste. Jean-Baptiste.

341
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:45,080
What's the matter?

342
00:46:45,634 --> 00:46:49,407
I... I have to learn
how to capture a scent.

343
00:46:51,977 --> 00:46:53,424
What are you talking about?

344
00:46:53,921 --> 00:46:58,478
I have to learn how... how to
capture a scent and "reprose" it forever.

345
00:46:58,723 --> 00:47:01,736
- You mean "preserve".
- Yes, teach me that.

346
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:05,477
Calm down, my boy.
Calm down.

347
00:47:06,037 --> 00:47:07,578
We have work to do.

348
00:47:09,273 --> 00:47:14,454
The soul of beings is their scent.
You said that, master.

349
00:47:15,765 --> 00:47:16,649
Did I?

350
00:47:17,103 --> 00:47:20,962
I will make as many perfumes as you want.
But you have to teach me...

351
00:47:21,218 --> 00:47:23,795
how to capture
the smell of all things.

352
00:47:25,163 --> 00:47:26,482
Can you do that?

353
00:47:27,826 --> 00:47:32,158
- Well, naturally.
- Then teach me everything you know.

354
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,800
And I'll make you the best perfumer
in the whole world.

355
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:56,837
Imagine, Jean-Baptiste:

356
00:47:56,895 --> 00:48:03,254
ten thousand roses to produce
one single ounce of essential oil.

357
00:48:05,013 --> 00:48:10,901
Now, keep them flowing,
for the bottom petals will be given to stew,

358
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:12,727
while I set up the alembic.

359
00:48:12,771 --> 00:48:14,563
And take care.
Not to damage them.

360
00:48:14,824 --> 00:48:18,555
We have to let them go to
their deaths with their scent intact.

361
00:48:36,324 --> 00:48:39,677
Perfect! Now, help me
with the boiler set.

362
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,831
Temperature is vital.
When the quicksilver is here,

363
00:48:55,908 --> 00:49:00,602
the heat is precisely correct,
and the oil will gradually rise.

364
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:07,310
Note that this mechanism is
a remarkable invention of my own devising.

365
00:49:07,854 --> 00:49:13,521
You will observe how cold water
is pumped through here,

366
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:19,001
allowing the essence
to condense here...

367
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:20,922
until it finally...

368
00:49:22,085 --> 00:49:23,382
appears...

369
00:49:24,858 --> 00:49:26,113
here!

370
00:49:27,053 --> 00:49:33,153
Of course, out on the hillside above Grasse,
we had only to bellow pure fresh air.

371
00:49:34,156 --> 00:49:37,150
Ah, Grasse! What a town.

372
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:44,540
The Rome of scents.
The Promised Land of perfume.

373
00:49:45,884 --> 00:49:50,215
No man can rightly
call himself a perfumer,

374
00:49:50,562 --> 00:49:54,744
unless he has proved his worth
in that hallowed place.

375
00:49:57,076 --> 00:49:59,683
Not to worry!
It happens all the time.

376
00:50:01,256 --> 00:50:02,895
To Grasse.

377
00:50:20,126 --> 00:50:21,178
Master.

378
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:23,332
Look.

379
00:50:28,531 --> 00:50:30,900
The very soul of the rose.

380
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:24,529
Jean-Baptiste.

381
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:28,347
What's wrong?

382
00:51:29,779 --> 00:51:31,151
Jean-Baptiste.

383
00:51:34,185 --> 00:51:36,970
- What have you done?
- You lied.

384
00:51:37,308 --> 00:51:40,412
- What?
- You lied to me.

385
00:51:41,017 --> 00:51:43,772
How dare you
talk to me like that!

386
00:51:45,181 --> 00:51:47,788
You said I could capture
the scent of anything.

387
00:51:48,561 --> 00:51:49,947
And so you can!

388
00:51:53,828 --> 00:51:55,023
What do you smell?

389
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:57,613
What do you smell?

390
00:52:02,832 --> 00:52:03,511
Nothing.

391
00:52:06,913 --> 00:52:10,233
- What were you expecting to smell?
- Glass.

392
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,832
- But glass doesn't smell.
- Of course it does. What's this?

393
00:52:19,888 --> 00:52:21,403
I don't smell a thing.

394
00:52:22,225 --> 00:52:22,916
Basta!

395
00:52:22,968 --> 00:52:25,258
- Did you smell that copper?
- Enough!

396
00:52:28,233 --> 00:52:31,675
You were trying to distil
the smell of copper?

397
00:52:32,175 --> 00:52:33,011
iron...

398
00:52:33,064 --> 00:52:34,029
glass...

399
00:52:34,491 --> 00:52:35,754
copper...

400
00:52:39,265 --> 00:52:40,913
What else did you try?

401
00:52:44,674 --> 00:52:45,430
No!

402
00:52:47,618 --> 00:52:49,566
Have you gone completely insane?!

403
00:52:50,511 --> 00:52:52,550
You told me I had to experiment.

404
00:52:52,825 --> 00:52:57,806
Experiment? Experiment?
With a cat?!

405
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,706
What kind of a human being are youê é?

406
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:04,877
Don't you know anything?

407
00:53:05,204 --> 00:53:07,352
You can no more distil
the scent of a cat...

408
00:53:07,406 --> 00:53:09,811
than you can distil
the scent of you and me!

409
00:53:20,326 --> 00:53:23,105
- I can't?
- Of course not!

410
00:53:30,053 --> 00:53:31,675
He's in stadio ultimo.

411
00:53:31,729 --> 00:53:33,184
- What?
- He's dying.

412
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,732
Is there nothing you can do?

413
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,315
- I fear not.
- No! He cannot die.

414
00:53:38,372 --> 00:53:42,274
- Well, the fee is 50 francs.
- 50 francs? You're a charlatan!

415
00:53:48,012 --> 00:53:52,011
Oh dear, Jean-Baptiste!

416
00:53:53,092 --> 00:53:57,158
You cannot do this to me.
Please, don't die on me.

417
00:53:57,492 --> 00:53:59,723
Not now, not yet!

418
00:54:10,713 --> 00:54:12,905
Is there...

419
00:54:16,547 --> 00:54:18,493
any other way...

420
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:22,608
to preserve smell
besides distil it?

421
00:54:23,007 --> 00:54:24,751
Jean-Baptiste...

422
00:54:29,517 --> 00:54:35,400
- Is there, master?
- Well, yes, I... I believe there is.

423
00:54:36,809 --> 00:54:38,689
What is ité?

424
00:54:40,445 --> 00:54:44,403
It is known as
the mysterious art of Enfleurage.

425
00:54:46,794 --> 00:54:48,408
Can you teach me?

426
00:54:51,418 --> 00:54:54,608
Not even I am intimate
with the secrets.

427
00:54:57,265 --> 00:54:59,682
But could I learn it in Grasse?

428
00:55:00,786 --> 00:55:03,535
- Well...
- Could I?

429
00:55:09,274 --> 00:55:12,429
Where else but in Grasse!

430
00:55:18,042 --> 00:55:20,350
Within a week, Grenouille was well again.

431
00:55:20,702 --> 00:55:23,364
But in order to travel to Grasse,
and find a job,

432
00:55:23,406 --> 00:55:25,966
he needed a journeyman's papers.

433
00:55:26,202 --> 00:55:28,018
Baldini agreed to provide them,

434
00:55:28,345 --> 00:55:34,052
on condition that Grenouille left him
not less than 100 formulas for new perfumes.

435
00:55:34,852 --> 00:55:38,948
Grenouille did not mind.
He could've given him a thousand.

436
00:55:44,279 --> 00:55:48,181
The morning of Grenouille's departure,
Baldini was pleased.

437
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:52,566
At last, he felt rewarded
for his many years of hard work.

438
00:55:53,086 --> 00:55:56,171
He could not remember
a happier day.

439
00:55:56,369 --> 00:55:59,171
Deeply satisfied, he went
back to sleep...

440
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:02,618
and awoke no more
in this life.

441
00:56:20,891 --> 00:56:25,626
With every step Grenouille took away
from the city, the happier he felt.

442
00:56:26,072 --> 00:56:30,786
The air above him grew
clearer, purer, cleaner.

443
00:56:30,916 --> 00:56:33,989
And at last, he was
able to breathe freely.

444
00:56:37,347 --> 00:56:39,936
There were two ways
to reach Grasse.

445
00:56:40,137 --> 00:56:43,649
The first followed the winding road
through the villages...

446
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,658
while the second lay straight across
the hills and mountains,

447
00:56:46,715 --> 00:56:48,825
down into Provence.

448
00:56:49,817 --> 00:56:52,083
The choice was quite easy.

449
00:56:55,805 --> 00:57:00,634
Thus, his nose led him ever higher,
ever further from mankind.

450
00:57:01,037 --> 00:57:06,372
Ever more towards the magnetic pole
of the greatest possible solitude.

451
00:57:43,524 --> 00:57:44,897
Grenouille needed a moment...

452
00:57:44,949 --> 00:57:47,869
to believe that he had actually
found a spot on earth...

453
00:57:47,903 --> 00:57:50,724
where scent was almost absent.

454
00:57:55,725 --> 00:57:56,936
Spread all around...

455
00:57:56,999 --> 00:58:00,077
lay nothing but the tranquil
scent of dead stone.

456
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:06,350
There was something
sacred about this place.

457
00:58:09,865 --> 00:58:12,471
No longer distracted
by anything external,

458
00:58:13,194 --> 00:58:17,751
he was finally able
to bask in his own existence.

459
00:58:19,164 --> 00:58:22,362
And found it splendid!

460
00:58:29,313 --> 00:58:33,569
After a while, he almost forgot
his plans and obsessions.

461
00:58:34,894 --> 00:58:38,393
And indeed,
might've done so altogether.

462
00:58:52,773 --> 00:58:53,951
Helloá.

463
00:58:57,896 --> 00:58:59,255
Helloá.

464
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:03,338
Helloá.

465
00:59:20,135 --> 00:59:22,865
There were a thousand smells
in his clothes.

466
00:59:22,928 --> 00:59:25,842
The smell of sand, stone, moss...

467
00:59:25,881 --> 00:59:28,412
even the smell of the sausage
he'd eaten weeks ago.

468
00:59:28,882 --> 00:59:31,257
Only one smell was not there:

469
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,877
His own.

470
01:00:11,404 --> 01:00:13,964
For the first time in his life,
Grenouille realized...

471
01:00:14,024 --> 01:00:16,523
that he had no smell of his own.

472
01:00:17,789 --> 01:00:19,276
He realized that all his life...

473
01:00:19,352 --> 01:00:21,700
he had been a nobody
to everyone.

474
01:00:22,895 --> 01:00:26,574
What he now felt
was the fear of his own oblivion.

475
01:00:27,259 --> 01:00:28,881
It was as though...

476
01:00:29,044 --> 01:00:30,922
he did not exist.

477
01:00:36,102 --> 01:00:40,247
By the first light of next morning,
Grenouille had a new plan.

478
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,450
He must continue
his journey to Grasse.

479
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:47,167
There he would teach the world
not only that he existed...

480
01:00:47,238 --> 01:00:48,866
that he was someone...

481
01:00:49,193 --> 01:00:51,696
but that he was exceptional.

482
01:00:55,576 --> 01:00:57,226
And with this decision,

483
01:00:57,629 --> 01:01:01,732
it seemed that the gods
had at last begun to smile on him.

484
01:05:18,257 --> 01:05:19,521
Laura?

485
01:05:26,906 --> 01:05:28,141
Laura?

486
01:05:28,918 --> 01:05:30,684
Coming, papa.

487
01:06:05,775 --> 01:06:08,042
Haven't seen you here before.

488
01:06:09,523 --> 01:06:11,192
It's my first season.

489
01:06:12,621 --> 01:06:14,690
Picking together
is always more fun.

490
01:06:16,034 --> 01:06:18,177
They say you pick
everything you find.

491
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:04,745
Idiot! How many times do I told you
not to cram the blossoms in...

492
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:06,468
like you're stuffing a chicken?

493
01:07:07,939 --> 01:07:09,633
Watch how Grenouille does it.

494
01:07:11,606 --> 01:07:15,547
Look how skillfully he handles them.
The whole art of Enflourage...

495
01:07:15,585 --> 01:07:19,507
is to allow the flowers to die slowly,
in their sleep as it were...

496
01:07:19,834 --> 01:07:24,587
handle them as you would a lady.
Wouldn't you agree with me, Druot?

497
01:07:25,036 --> 01:07:26,810
If you say so, madame.

498
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:31,921
You! Check the jonquil blossoms.

499
01:07:35,307 --> 01:07:36,906
It need more time.

500
01:07:39,394 --> 01:07:41,099
Do what I say.

501
01:08:23,482 --> 01:08:24,681
Stop it!

502
01:08:25,579 --> 01:08:26,914
I'm not in the mood.

503
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:28,520
Are you sure?

504
01:08:29,485 --> 01:08:31,119
Of course I'm sure.

505
01:08:37,175 --> 01:08:38,724
I said...

506
01:08:41,272 --> 01:08:42,700
"no".

507
01:08:53,446 --> 01:08:55,103
Suit yourself.

508
01:08:58,228 --> 01:08:59,667
Lucien?

509
01:09:02,853 --> 01:09:05,629
- Fetch me by the ladder!
- Fetch it yourself!

510
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:18,606
Lucien?

511
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:23,122
Lucien!

512
01:09:33,554 --> 01:09:34,779
Lucien?

513
01:09:37,827 --> 01:09:39,246
Lucien?

514
01:09:57,155 --> 01:09:58,564
Lucien.

515
01:10:53,495 --> 01:10:54,528
Tuberoses.

516
01:10:54,922 --> 01:10:57,690
For Madame Arnulfi.
She hereá?

517
01:11:01,102 --> 01:11:01,939
She's busy.

518
01:11:09,548 --> 01:11:11,854
Seem such a waste to boil them!

519
01:11:12,927 --> 01:11:15,197
Or whatever you do with them.

520
01:11:19,937 --> 01:11:22,548
So, what do you do with them?

521
01:11:22,999 --> 01:11:26,717
- Warm them in animal fat.
- What for?

522
01:11:26,983 --> 01:11:29,360
The fat soaks up
their scent.

523
01:11:29,505 --> 01:11:30,751
Then what?

524
01:11:32,847 --> 01:11:36,433
Then I cool it
toward pomade, and...

525
01:11:37,045 --> 01:11:40,694
and then I filter it, before...

526
01:11:44,578 --> 01:11:45,844
Before what?

527
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:49,190
Before adding alcohol and other essences
to make perfume.

528
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,422
Don't touch anything!

529
01:11:56,648 --> 01:11:57,751
What's in there?

530
01:11:59,256 --> 01:12:00,754
Nothing, just flowers.

531
01:12:01,272 --> 01:12:02,442
- Can I look?
- No.

532
01:12:03,054 --> 01:12:05,284
Not now, I've got work to do.
You must go now.

533
01:12:05,309 --> 01:12:08,032
- Ah, come on, let me look.
- Don't touch!

534
01:12:10,981 --> 01:12:13,353
- Morning, madame.
- Morning.

535
01:12:16,686 --> 01:12:19,197
Why do you cover the tank?

536
01:12:20,289 --> 01:12:23,167
It's an experiment, madame, to...

537
01:12:23,568 --> 01:12:27,055
to... protect the blossoms
from daylight,

538
01:12:27,315 --> 01:12:29,091
to preserve the scent better.

539
01:12:30,237 --> 01:12:32,337
Well, if you say so.

540
01:12:33,745 --> 01:12:37,296
Come with me.
I'll settle your master's account.

541
01:12:39,286 --> 01:12:41,705
To preserve their scent better, you say?

542
01:12:55,426 --> 01:12:56,913
I don't smell much.

543
01:13:02,991 --> 01:13:06,954
No. Then my experiment
was a failure.

544
01:13:10,132 --> 01:13:13,224
Make sure it's your time
you're wasting, not ours.

545
01:13:25,356 --> 01:13:27,047
How much must I pay?

546
01:13:29,135 --> 01:13:30,839
To be with youê.

547
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,003
Depends what you want.

548
01:13:46,764 --> 01:13:48,157
What's that stuff?

549
01:13:51,287 --> 01:13:53,061
I'm creating a perfume.

550
01:13:56,132 --> 01:13:57,434
Lie down, please.

551
01:14:16,537 --> 01:14:17,909
They feels horrible.

552
01:14:19,071 --> 01:14:22,620
It's only animal fat.
To soak up your scent.

553
01:14:23,475 --> 01:14:25,750
Creating a perfume, mate?

554
01:14:25,929 --> 01:14:26,802
Come on, admit it.

555
01:14:26,886 --> 01:14:29,213
You're getting some sorta
bang out of this, aren't you?

556
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:31,199
Aren't you?

557
01:14:32,023 --> 01:14:33,865
I enjoy my work.

558
01:14:35,386 --> 01:14:37,106
Keep your arm still.

559
01:14:44,434 --> 01:14:46,155
Don't think you're
gonna tie me up.

560
01:14:47,337 --> 01:14:49,225
Hold out your arm, please.

561
01:14:56,968 --> 01:14:58,870
I've come across
some strange men in my time...

562
01:14:58,873 --> 01:15:02,246
Just... relax!

563
01:15:09,175 --> 01:15:11,190
Holy Mother! What's that?

564
01:15:14,153 --> 01:15:16,878
- Just scraping off the fat.
- Are you mad?

565
01:15:16,935 --> 01:15:19,853
I said relax!
You'll ruin everything.

566
01:15:20,425 --> 01:15:24,109
Your frighten just stink,
your perfume will be spoiled.

567
01:15:24,251 --> 01:15:25,419
I've had enough!

568
01:15:26,679 --> 01:15:29,526
Get out!
Here, take your money!

569
01:15:30,133 --> 01:15:33,177
Baste me with all these goo.
What do you think I am? A Christmas goose?

570
01:15:33,624 --> 01:15:35,183
Get out of here!
