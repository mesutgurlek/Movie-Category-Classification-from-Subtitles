1
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:44,698
<i>In October, my brother and I left Ohio.
We were driving to California.</i>

2
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,038
<i>We got into Dallas on a Thursday night.</i>

3
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:52,842
Friday morning, while I'm eating eggs
and drinking coffee, I get a good job.

4
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,442
All these people
are supposedly out of work.

5
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,048
I'm not in town a half a day,
and I've got a job.

6
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:05,046
Everything clicked.
It's as if I was meant to be here.

7
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:15,130
I'd run away from home a couple
of times. Once or twice. I don't know.

8
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,870
And this all started,
David is running away from home.

9
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,874
<i>And he takes... I took
a pistol of my dad's and a shotgun.</i>

10
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,537
Took a neighbor's car.

11
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,782
I had broken into their house
and got the keys to it.

12
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,580
I forget exactly what it was.

13
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,021
Ended up coming to Dallas.

14
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,597
<i>I went to work and no one showed up.</i>

15
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:55,471
<i>Being a weekend, sometimes
they worked, sometimes they didn't.</i>

16
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:59,074
On the way home, I ran out of gas.

17
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,180
And as I was walking down the street
with the gas can...

18
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,645
a person, at that time, pulled over.

19
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,685
I guess since I had the gas can...

20
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:13,954
he figured I was out of gas.
I wasn't 100 yards from the car.

21
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,520
And being Thanksgiving weekend,
there was no gas stations open.

22
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,792
He stopped and asked me
if I needed any help.

23
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,936
<i>I'm driving down some street
somewhere in Dallas.</i>

24
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,564
<i>I had just turned 16.</i>

25
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,938
<i>And there was a guy over there,
I think he'd run out of gas...</i>

26
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:37,881
<i>I took him to get some gas.
This was Randall Adams.</i>

27
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:46,748
<i>Ended up following him where
him and his brother were staying.</i>

28
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,224
Eventually, that evening...

29
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,658
we went out and got some beer.

30
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,629
We smoked a little marijuana
and what have you.

31
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,598
Went to a movie that night.

32
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,443
I get up, I go to work on Saturday.

33
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,241
Why did I meet this kid? I don't know.

34
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:12,250
Why did I run out of gas at that time?
I don't know. But it happened.

35
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,888
<i>The day they picked me up, December 21.</i>

36
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,962
They took me upstairs.
What floor, I don't know.

37
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,625
But they put me in a little room.

38
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,328
<i>Gus Rose walked in.</i>

39
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,773
<i>He had a confession there
he wanted me to sign.</i>

40
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,074
<i>He said that I would sign.</i>

41
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:30,316
<i>He didn't give a damn what I said.
I would sign this piece of paper.</i>

42
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,849
<i>I told him I couldn't.</i>

43
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:40,689
"I don't know what the hell
you people expect of me.

44
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,031
"But there's no way I can sign that."

45
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,868
He left. He came back in 10 minutes.

46
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,632
<i>And threw a pistol on the table.</i>

47
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:55,207
Asked me to look at it. Which I did. I looked.

48
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,309
<i>He asked me to pick it up.</i>

49
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,778
<i>I told him no, I wouldn't do that.</i>

50
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,221
<i>He threatened me.</i>

51
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,958
<i>Again, I told him no.</i>

52
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,425
<i>He pulled his service revolver on me.</i>

53
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,733
<i>We looked at each other for...
To me, it seemed hours.</i>

54
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,805
I do not like looking down
the barrel of a pistol.

55
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,200
I do not like being threatened.

56
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:30,011
When he finally saw
that he would either have to kill me...

57
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,383
or forget the signature...

58
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,888
I guess he forgot the signature,
because he put his pistol up.

59
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:41,321
He took the pistol on the table,
put it up and stormed out.

60
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:46,087
I had a casual, friendly conversation
with him to start with...

61
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,759
to try to size him up...

62
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,827
to see what he liked and what he didn't like.

63
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:57,402
I found almost immediately
that he didn't have much conscience.

64
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,573
Anything he had done,
it never really bothered him.

65
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,849
He had done other things
that he told me about...

66
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,477
that didn't seem to bother him in the least.

67
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:10,044
He showed no expression whatsoever.

68
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:16,094
It's just like he's sitting here
talking about the color of this wall...

69
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,561
or the shooting of the police officer.

70
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,970
He showed no reaction
to any of the questions.

71
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,976
He almost overacted his innocence.

72
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,635
He protested he hadn't done anything.

73
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,511
Couldn't imagine
why we were bringing him in.

74
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,383
He didn't fight or he didn't resist.

75
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,647
He just protested his innocence.

76
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:49,818
I told them what happened that
Saturday, that I had met this kid.

77
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,724
<i>I kept telling them the same thing.</i>

78
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,191
<i>They didn't want to believe me.</i>

79
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,797
<i>Never once was I allowed a phone call.</i>

80
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,706
<i>Never once was an attorney there.</i>

81
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,901
<i>I don't know how long this had been.</i>

82
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:10,376
<i>I had smoked two packs of cigarettes
and had been out for a long time.</i>

83
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,168
Wood didn't take his ticket book
out of the car.

84
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,602
He left it in the car on the front seat...

85
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,573
which indicates
that he was not going to write a ticket.

86
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:39,304
What he was probably going to do
was have them turn on the headlights.

87
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:43,041
He didn't know that the car was stolen.

88
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,917
I think that there's a very good chance...

89
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,546
that he was going
to check the driver's license...

90
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:53,251
and tell him to turn on his headlights,
and let the guy be on his way.

91
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,851
Officer Wood's wife had purchased him...

92
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,989
a bulletproof vest
and had it under the Christmas tree.

93
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,968
<i>Or had it stored away,
to give to him at Christmastime.</i>

94
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:10,208
His partner was one of the first
female police officers...

95
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,402
that was assigned to patrol.

96
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:15,504
They were from the Northwest Station.
Just patrol officers following the clock.

97
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,106
<i>Working the graveyard shift and everything.</i>

98
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,353
<i>They had been into a fast-food
restaurant. And she had a malt.</i>

99
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:27,324
<i>This car came by, these
two dudes in it, with no lights on.</i>

100
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,469
<i>It wasn't a serious problem...</i>

101
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,268
<i>but he just pulled up,
turned his lights on to stop him.</i>

102
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,037
<i>Just to warn the man
that his lights were off.</i>

103
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,287
<i>Got out of the car and walked up.</i>

104
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,418
<i>Before he got to the window,
where the driver was...</i>

105
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,894
he was in the right position.

106
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,329
This man just turned around and just...

107
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,890
with a little small-caliber pistol.

108
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,335
The first shot hit him in the arm.

109
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:23,045
He had his flashlight. It hit
the flashlight and went into his arm.

110
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,878
The next one hit him right in the chest.

111
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,595
<i>The officer falls in the street
and he was in the first traffic lane.</i>

112
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,653
<i>He lay there and bled to death.</i>

113
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,622
<i>So she's out of the car.</i>

114
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,261
<i>She empties her pistol
at the fleeing suspect...</i>

115
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,031
<i>and she runs to his aid.</i>

116
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,870
Procedure says you grab the radio
and call for an ambulance.

117
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,914
Common sense would tell you that.
But what do you do?

118
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,981
<i>And that time, she's so... just tore down.</i>

119
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,711
<i>And the blood.
An enormous amount of blood.</i>

120
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:14,599
How do we hold her responsible
for not following procedure?

121
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,201
But the main thing was, she
couldn't remember the license number.

122
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:40,684
When we started putting facts together
on how much information we had...

123
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,963
from the leads we had,
we found out we didn't have anything.

124
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:51,264
The only thing that we knew
we were looking for was a blue Vega.

125
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:56,468
<i>Probably every Vega that was
registered in the state of Texas...</i>

126
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,439
<i>was stopped and checked.</i>

127
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,371
We had people calling the office...

128
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,508
saying, "I've got a Vega and it's not blue.

129
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,848
"But would you come out
and be sure to check it.

130
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,754
"Be sure it's not mine, because
I don't want to get stopped anymore.

131
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,086
"I'm afraid."

132
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,156
If you're the investigator
assigned to the murder...

133
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,565
you get frustrated with other witnesses.

134
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,901
But when you got a police officer
that witnessed it...

135
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,703
you expect that they would know
a little more than she knew.

136
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:32,933
<i>Procedure.</i>

137
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:36,345
<i>When there's a two-person unit,
when either one approaches the car...</i>

138
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,111
<i>the other positions himself
to the right rear...</i>

139
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,348
<i>where they can watch
all the activity in the car.</i>

140
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:46,284
<i>And if the man on the left of the driver
gets in trouble...</i>

141
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,054
<i>their partner is in a position to help.</i>

142
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,064
Speculation was, at the time...

143
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,096
that his partner was sitting in the car.

144
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,252
<i>That's where the discrepancies were.</i>

145
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,686
<i>Just a matter of time, and whether
or not she was out of the car...</i>

146
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,493
<i>completely out of the car,
or partially in the car...</i>

147
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,126
<i>or just sitting in there with the door closed.</i>

148
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:35,334
<i>And the thing I think we did then
that really helped...</i>

149
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:40,240
It didn't really help anything at all.
Let me back up.

150
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,906
But it was interesting,
and it cost a lot of money...

151
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,213
but it was worthwhile.
You got to cover every trail.

152
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,567
<i>A guy out of California...</i>

153
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,734
<i>I don't recall his name,
he was an expert in hypnosis.</i>

154
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,936
<i>He came down,
hypnotized her and questioned her.</i>

155
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,376
What was interesting was...

156
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,210
she couldn't remember anything
particularly about the car.

157
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,841
She remembered getting a malt.

158
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,386
They'd stopped in the fast-food.
It was a Whataburger.

159
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,648
They remembered all that,
and stopping the car.

160
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,054
Got back on the road.
She didn't remember anything.

161
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,993
But she remembered a license number
off a hit-and-run vehicle...

162
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,394
that they had worked earlier in the night.

163
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,950
<i>It was getting awfully close to Christmas.</i>

164
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:04,826
We'd never gone that long in Dallas
without clearing a murder of an officer.

165
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:08,025
We'd had several killed,
but we'd cleared them pretty quick.

166
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,297
And this case had gone a month,
or nearly a month...

167
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,334
and we still hadn't cleared it.

168
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:17,364
We finally got the break that cleared it.
It came out of Vidor, Texas.

169
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,781
Mr. Calvin Cunningham, who lives
in Vidor, had his home broken into...

170
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:29,878
and his little Mercury Comet stolen.

171
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,881
<i>We felt as though
David had committed that crime.</i>

172
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,461
<i>For several days, though,
he was missing. We couldn't find him.</i>

173
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:41,960
It was one afternoon, one of our
officers spotted Cunningham's car...

174
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,229
on North Main Street, here in Vidor.

175
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,430
David abandoned the vehicle
and ran on foot.

176
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,345
We started getting
little bits of information, though...

177
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:57,849
that David had been involved in a
shooting in Dallas of a police officer.

178
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,478
<i>We would always get
third-hand rumor, fourth-hand rumor.</i>

179
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:07,089
So we went back to a few of his other
comrades in crime, we could call them.

180
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,658
They said,
"We thought he was just bragging.

181
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,095
"We didn't really take him seriously."

182
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,066
Sitting down, watching the
evening news, well, the night news.

183
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,262
My father was asleep on the couch.

184
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,869
Heard somebody knocking at the door.
It was David Harris.

185
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,174
I let him in. He came in.

186
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,711
He was standing there beside my chair...

187
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:31,182
and a news broadcast advertised
about a police officer shot in Dallas.

188
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,944
Right then and there he starts
swearing up and down.

189
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,421
He says, "I swear to God,
I shot that fucking pig."

190
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,591
He says, "I'm the one that killed him."

191
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,253
Somewhere around Dallas,
they got pulled over.

192
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,896
I think he said because
they were checking out a stolen car.

193
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,829
He said that the cop had pulled him over...

194
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,798
and walked up to the window.

195
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,405
When the cop came,
he rolled down the window...

196
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,840
and just pulled the gun up and shot him.

197
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,467
He swore up and down.

198
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,810
He made a big scene about it.
Jumped up and down...

199
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,949
trying to get anybody and everybody...

200
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,043
to listen to him.
"Yeah, I shot that son of a gun."

201
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:11,117
And everybody said,
"Sure you did, David. Sure."

202
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,990
"I swear to God I killed that cop."

203
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,892
I asked him if he'd been to Dallas.
He denied having been to Dallas.

204
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,932
I asked him if he'd been involved
in any shooting...

205
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,993
or knew anything about a shooting,
and he denied that to the end.

206
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:30,239
Which is fairly consistent with David.
Even if he had some involvement...

207
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:34,006
his first way that he always treats you,
he would deny.

208
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,980
Then, if he felt as though
you really knew he had done it...

209
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,914
then he would be truthful with you.

210
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,909
He give me a pistol, a.22 caliber pistol.

211
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:46,490
He showed it to me. He says,
"That's the one I shot him with."

212
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,290
He gave me the pistol.

213
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,925
I didn't really consider it that much.

214
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,229
I don't guess I really realized
he did shoot the cop.

215
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,493
He led me to a swampy area...

216
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,638
several hundred yards
behind his residence in Rose City.

217
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,268
<i>There was a sock under water.
He said, "There it is."</i>

218
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,040
<i>And he had sprayed this sock with boot oil.</i>

219
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,145
When we retrieved the gun...

220
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,674
I said, "I better do something with it.
It's going to rust up."

221
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:19,213
Even the time that I saw the gun
at the trial in Dallas...

222
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,226
it looked just as good
as when I'd taken it out of the swamp.

223
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:26,162
So he had taken pretty good care of it,
even though he did put it under water.

224
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,129
He got to thinking...

225
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,636
"I didn't do that
and I've been saying that I did...

226
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,739
"and I'm in over my head now,
I better tell them what happened.

227
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:43,679
"Because they are going to send me
to the penitentiary for life...

228
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,309
"if I don't tell them what really happened."

229
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,752
So he said, "I am just bragging about this.

230
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:53,552
"I didn't do it, but I was there,
and I know who did do it."

231
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,957
And, of course, he came clean then.

232
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,792
<i>He tried to hide no facts.</i>

233
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,831
<i>He just seemed like a friendly kid.</i>

234
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:10,134
I may have talked to him
15 or 20 minutes on a friendly basis...

235
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,907
just to keep him friendly.

236
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,042
We didn't want to make him mad.

237
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,123
But we didn't want him to tell us
something that he thought.

238
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,456
We wanted him to tell us what we knew.

239
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:33,158
It wasn't very long until I realized
that what he knew...

240
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,795
was the facts of the case,
and it matched with what we knew.

241
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,496
And it had to be right.

242
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,339
<i>The story that I told was...</i>

243
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,269
It was like 12:00 something.
So it was the next day...

244
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,711
early in the morning. We were stopped.

245
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,946
When we were stopped,
the officer came up to the car...

246
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,326
and asked to see the driver's license,
and he just started shooting.

247
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:11,896
I don't know why, but it's always
seemed like time just stopped.

248
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,835
It didn't seem like any time passed.

249
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,741
It just seemed like it was, boom!

250
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:25,078
Time stopped or something.
I don't know what it is.

251
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,521
It's like a flash.

252
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,921
<i>We went back to his room.</i>

253
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:40,928
He was supposed to ask his brother
if I could stay there that night.

254
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,296
But he said
that his brother don't like to do that.

255
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,973
Anyhow, he went in
and never came back out. So I left.

256
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,806
Ended up pulling into a parking lot.

257
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,643
I slept there I think, for a while.

258
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,809
Then, finally, the next morning,
early or something...

259
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,583
I found my way to Freeway 45.

260
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,822
And went back home.

261
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:17,334
After riding around with him,
I come to find out he's got an arsenal.

262
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:21,634
He's got pistols. He's got rifles.

263
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,004
He's got this pistol.
He's waving it around. He's doing this.

264
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:30,305
I told him, "Hey, why don't you put
those in the trunk of the car?"

265
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,050
<i>We stopped at a restaurant...</i>

266
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,917
and ordered and ate sandwiches in the car.

267
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,613
I bought a six-pack of beer.

268
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,516
<i>He pulled this pistol back out.</i>

269
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,321
And I ask him why he got the pistol out.

270
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:49,100
And he kind of laughed...

271
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,694
rolled the window down,
and fired the pistol outside the car.

272
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,398
And I asked him to please put it up.

273
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:03,537
And I think he handed me the pistol,
and I put it under the driver's seat.

274
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:07,342
<i>He wanted to go to the movies,
so we went to the movies.</i>

275
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,086
<i>We got there probably at about 7:00.</i>

276
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,161
<i>He was the one
that had picked the movie out.</i>

277
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,370
<i>I call them drive-in movies,
beer-drinking movies.</i>

278
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,338
<i>$0.50, put them together
and make a bunch of money...</i>

279
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,376
<i>with a bunch of people
getting drunk at the drive-in.</i>

280
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,776
<i>- Are you going to concede?
- Please, sit down...</i>

281
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,575
<i>What is this, Mr. Brooks?</i>

282
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,712
<i>- Anybody can see it's an ashtray.
- Wrong!</i>

283
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,877
<i>Anybody can plainly see it's a wall-breaker!</i>

284
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,012
<i>I'm trying to speak for you!</i>

285
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:49,560
<i>I'm trying to speak for all of you!
I am the student body!</i>

286
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:56,294
<i>The show that was on was half over.
We watched half of the one show...</i>

287
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,705
<i>we started watching
the first part of the second show.</i>

288
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,871
<i>We want a victory, and we're gonna get it.</i>

289
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,957
<i>I didn't really care for the second feature...</i>

290
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:23,893
<i>which is an R-rated, cheerleader-type thing.</i>

291
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,691
<i>I don't know what it was.</i>

292
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,155
<i>May I have some wine?</i>

293
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,382
<i>It's good, Ross.
I didn't know you could cook.</i>

294
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:48,976
<i>It is good, isn't it?</i>

295
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,752
<i>You got to try my celery rémoulade.</i>

296
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,071
<i>No.</i>

297
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,678
<i>I told him I wanted to leave.</i>

298
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:19,841
"I don't really care
to sit here and watch this. Let's go."

299
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,792
He's acting strange, he wanted
to watch the end. Anyway, we left.

300
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,921
<i>We drove back towards Dallas
and we drove to the motel.</i>

301
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:37,568
<i>There's a little store.
I bought a pack of cigarettes...</i>

302
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,069
<i>and a newspaper.</i>

303
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:42,137
And when I left,
this kid was still sitting there.

304
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,842
I leaned against the car and we
talked to him for a few minutes...

305
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:50,939
and I told him
that since he was looking for a job...

306
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,950
and there hadn't been anybody at work...

307
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,748
that if he wanted to stop back
Monday morning...

308
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,687
that sure, he could ride out
and follow me to work...

309
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:02,124
and he could talk to the boss.
And he would probably get a job.

310
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,921
I told him that I would catch him
Monday morning if he showed up.

311
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:09,398
I told him what time I went to work.
Why, I left.

312
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,197
I walked around the store
and went to the house.

313
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:16,940
When I walked in, the television was
on and my brother was sleeping.

314
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:20,242
He had been home this whole time
that I had been gone.

315
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,676
<i>So I made me a sandwich...</i>

316
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,440
<i>and sat there and watched the end of
The Carol Burnett Show.</i>

317
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:34,353
<i>When it went off, the news came on
and I watched 15 minutes of it.</i>

318
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:38,624
And that was it.
I turned the TV off and went to sleep.

319
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,846
<i>Finally, they bring in a stenographer.</i>

320
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,813
<i>She sits down and I run the story.</i>

321
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:03,218
<i>I tell them what happened this Saturday.</i>

322
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,719
<i>She leaves. She types.</i>

323
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:35,685
<i>She comes back in about 25 to 30 minutes...</i>

324
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,348
<i>with a copy of this statement.</i>

325
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,181
<i>I read through it...</i>

326
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,921
<i>and when it was basically what I liked...</i>

327
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,597
<i>yes, I signed it.</i>

328
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:03,237
He admits driving the car
and taking a right on Inwood Road...

329
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,708
off of Interstate 35...

330
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,179
or Highway 183.

331
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,625
He admits driving it.

332
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:19,289
After he made his right turn
on Inwood Road...

333
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,659
<i>this is where our statement ends.</i>

334
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:28,066
<i>He says he does not
remember anything after that.</i>

335
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,504
He didn't remember anything
about a shooting.

336
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:35,945
He didn't remember anything about
a police officer stopping him.

337
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,784
That part of his mind
just conveniently went blank.

338
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,481
He remembered driving the car...

339
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,422
and he remembered approaching
the scene of the shooting...

340
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,618
and then, from that point, he blacks out...

341
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,127
and can't remember
until he gets to the motel room...

342
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:54,962
which is some 10 minutes later.
Everything else he remembers vividly.

343
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,331
And that's just a convenient memory
lapse, is all that is.

344
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:06,036
<i>The Morning News in Dallas County...</i>

345
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,272
stated that I had signed a confession...

346
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:10,974
that I had confessed
to the killing of Robert Wood...

347
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,143
and they had their killer
and they were ready to go with it.

348
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:19,914
<i>The statement that I signed
for Dallas County...</i>

349
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,120
was never...

350
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:27,290
and never would have been anything
as "a confession."

351
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,458
But yet, they labeled it as such.

352
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:35,371
<i>Of course, I couldn't dispute this
because I didn't even know about it.</i>

353
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:40,100
I heard no news.
I knew nothing for two weeks.

354
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,041
They kept me completely away
from everybody.

355
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:51,420
Several times we talked to her,
trying to get her to recall.

356
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:55,653
"Do you recall the license number?
Do you recall anything to help us?"

357
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,423
And she gave us
a pretty good description of the car.

358
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,795
As it turned out, her description
of the car was real close.

359
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,638
It comes out that we weren't
looking for a blue Vega.

360
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,838
We were looking for a Comet.

361
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,978
No telling the man-hours
we literally wasted...

362
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,977
looking for a blue Vega.

363
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,458
There is a difference
between a Vega and a Mercury Comet.

364
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,331
So in reality, in regard to cars...

365
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:41,036
every piece of information
that was called in...

366
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:45,473
they were calling in regard to a Comet,
I mean, a Vega.

367
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:57,286
The people that called in were truthful,
trying to help.

368
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,983
They really were trying to help.

369
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,356
We just all had the wrong information.

370
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,481
There wasn't a mark on this car
David Harris had stolen.

371
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,916
Wasn't a mark.

372
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,813
Do you think a car sitting still...

373
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:35,657
starting from a stop, heading up a hill...

374
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,028
with a woman standing right behind it...

375
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,326
<i>that is a very good shot with a pistol...</i>

376
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,333
She should have hit
the damn thing one time. She didn't.

377
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:47,235
I wish to God she had blown whoever
was driving the car's head off...

378
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,466
because I wouldn't have been here.

379
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,078
I went back several times...

380
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:58,604
and with Mr. Cunningham,
he and I both searched...

381
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:03,016
and could find no indications that
that car had been hit by gunfire.

382
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:08,024
Later on, he finally found one place...

383
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,391
that he felt as though
that a bullet had been creased on it.

384
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,597
But before he could tell me about it,
his daughter totaled the car out.

385
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,626
<i>Totally demolished it.</i>

386
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:25,099
I was doing burglaries and some robberies...

387
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:30,011
and a few possession cases
and stuff like that.

388
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,311
I think he just came up to me and said:

389
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:36,012
"Are you Edith James?
I'd like to talk about my case."

390
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,282
That's the way I remember it, anyhow.

391
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:42,021
And I said, "Sure."
And I said, "What sort of a case is it?"

392
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,857
<i>He said, "It's a capital murder." And I said...</i>

393
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,521
Inside, I kind of thought:

394
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:50,727
"I've never done one,
but I can surely talk to him about it."

395
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,999
I hate to be considered...

396
00:32:57,075 --> 00:33:01,478
some kind of dummy that believes
in the innocence of her clients.

397
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,615
A lot of people think, "A woman lawyer...

398
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:09,449
"she's bound to stupidly believe
anything she's told."

399
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,623
I admit, I'm sort of a gullible person.

400
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:17,389
But on the other hand,
I've seen an awful lot of people...

401
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:20,124
who admitted guilt or were found guilty...

402
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:24,893
and all but Randall turned out
to be guilty, in my opinion.

403
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,733
<i>Douglas Mulder had a perfect win record.</i>

404
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:36,636
<i>I believe he resigned from the
D.A. 's office without any defeats.</i>

405
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,745
<i>That's why he's legendary.</i>

406
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:43,387
Everything, as I recall,
that Mulder ever said...

407
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:45,479
was about what a great guy Mulder was...

408
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:49,616
<i>and how marvelous it was that
he was getting all these convictions.</i>

409
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:56,027
<i>I wanted somebody else in on it,
so I got Dennis interested in it...</i>

410
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,293
because Dennis has a lot more
trial experience...

411
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,339
and Dennis wins
practically all of his jury cases.

412
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,508
And Dennis was very enthusiastic
about the Randall Adams case...

413
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,738
because he kept saying,
"This is one we can win.

414
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:12,681
"They don't have substantial evidence.
All they've got is David Harris."

415
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:17,383
I prepared a motion for a continuance
to get more time to try the case...

416
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:22,886
and in doing that had to lay out
my schedule for several weeks...

417
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,485
as to exactly what time
I'd be in Vidor, Texas.

418
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,863
<i>Vidor is the headquarters of the
Ku Klux Klan for the state of Texas.</i>

419
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:33,126
<i>It's a city where black people
will not spend the night.</i>

420
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:37,163
<i>Black people won't even stop there
to get their car filled with gasoline.</i>

421
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,802
<i>And furthermore, the people of Vidor
were under the impression...</i>

422
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,847
<i>that the policeman that was murdered
was a black man.</i>

423
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,949
<i>I had to stop at a motel on the way.</i>

424
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,550
My wife and I stayed in one room,
the lady lawyer in another room.

425
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:54,887
We arranged to get up very early,
go to Vidor and start our investigation.

426
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,517
At about 6:00 in the morning...

427
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,687
Edith James, the lady lawyer, got up...

428
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,657
and was looking for me.

429
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:07,428
While she went out in the parking lot
to find me, she went to one room...

430
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,166
and someone in the parking lot said:

431
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,470
"If you're looking
for the lawyer from Dallas...

432
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,067
<i>"he's in room..."
And he gave her the room number.</i>

433
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,874
I immediately began to suspect...

434
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,974
from the time I was that close to Vidor,
I was being followed and observed.

435
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,714
<i>Doug Mulder had been there
the week before I had...</i>

436
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,154
<i>and had told the people in Vidor that I was...</i>

437
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:29,721
an Eastern-educated
civil liberties attorney...

438
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:34,730
and that I was down there
to discredit David Harris.

439
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:41,064
And then I had been recommended
to see one particular policeman...

440
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,939
who had been led
to the solution of this case.

441
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,976
And I had the impression...

442
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:50,445
that he was the one honest policeman
I could trust in Vidor.

443
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:55,150
<i>He told me that
after the policeman was killed...</i>

444
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,649
David Harris went back to Vidor.

445
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:01,453
But before he was arrested,
he committed a robbery down there...

446
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:05,788
and had someone on the floor
of a 7-Eleven type of store...

447
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,558
with a shotgun at her throat.

448
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,856
Got back there...

449
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:14,504
robbed O'Bannion's 7-Eleven with a.22 rifle.

450
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,673
Committed some other burglaries
and what have you.

451
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,546
All this time I was on probation.
Juvenile probation.

452
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:28,377
Eventually I turned myself in
for this stuff in Vidor.

453
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:38,027
I think I made a confession.
I can't even remember exactly.

454
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,095
So I'm told I did.

455
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,771
He had told us he had robbed stores,
and we laughed.

456
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,671
"Sure, we know you have."

457
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,767
I'd given him one of my hats.

458
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:56,870
It's an old Bonnie-and-Clyde-looking
hat, it's turned sideways.

459
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:00,179
<i>We said, "We'll draw you a little
mustache, walk in with that gun.</i>

460
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,446
<i>"Nobody'll know who you are."</i>

461
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:06,746
About 2:00 that morning,
I was asleep and the phone rings.

462
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:10,190
I said, "Hello?" He said, "This is
David." "This is David Harris?"

463
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,855
"Yeah," he said, "I did it.
Will you come and get me?"

464
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,125
I said, "I'm not coming to get you.
I'm asleep."

465
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,502
He didn't have a conscience.

466
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,773
If I do something bad, it kind of gets to me.

467
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:29,609
I feel, "Shucks, I shouldn't have done
that. I feel bad about it."

468
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,349
But it didn't bother him.
Didn't bother him at all.

469
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,728
<i>We asked the D.A. In Vidor, Texas...</i>

470
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:54,394
what they were going to do
with little David. They said:

471
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:57,202
"We'll send him
to the Texas Youth Council."

472
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,243
And we sort of tried to inquire...

473
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,871
didn't he think it was strange
that there was a robbery committed...

474
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,608
with that same pistol.

475
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:07,651
And here it was David Harris' pistol...

476
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:11,978
David Harris' automobile
that picked up Randall Adams.

477
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,517
Didn't he think it was a little odd...

478
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:18,619
that all the utensils for committing
this so-called murder...

479
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:22,765
were furnished by David Harris
who got off scot-free...

480
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,631
and was being a witness
for the prosecution?

481
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:30,197
And all he said was, "We don't
feel that way in Vidor, Texas.

482
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,642
<i>"Our people just are not that...</i>

483
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,942
"We're not that keen
on ruining a young man's life."

484
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:43,348
I tried to introduce the crime spree theory.

485
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,720
The theory that David Harris
was on this series of crimes...

486
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,857
both before and after
the killing of the policeman.

487
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,589
That he would be the person who had...

488
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,161
the heart filled with malice
most apt to commit a murder.

489
00:38:56,767 --> 00:39:00,362
<i>But the judge would not allow me
to introduce any of those crimes.</i>

490
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:04,033
<i>They'd had a 28-year-old man.</i>

491
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:08,040
The only alternative
would be prosecuting a 16-year-old...

492
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:11,275
that could not be given
the death penalty under Texas law...

493
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,374
where our 28-year-old man could.

494
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,920
That's always been the predominant
motive, in my opinion...

495
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:22,015
for having a death penalty case
against Randall Adams.

496
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,188
Not that they had him so dead to rights.

497
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,196
But just that he was a convenient age.

498
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,467
<i>The judge is supposed to have said...</i>

499
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:38,300
That Don Metcalfe
is supposed to have said...

500
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:42,144
to Jeanette White, Dennis White's wife...

501
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,841
"What do you care? He's only a drifter."

502
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,286
I grew up in a family...

503
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:53,585
where I was taught a great respect
for law enforcement.

504
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:57,627
I became acutely aware of the dangers...

505
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:01,392
that police officers go through,
law enforcement officials go through...

506
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:05,902
that I think much of the public
is not really sensitive to.

507
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,299
<i>My father was an FBI man.</i>

508
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:12,672
<i>Probably at the worst possible time
to be in the FBI.</i>

509
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,770
<i>It was from 1932 to 1935 in Chicago.</i>

510
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:22,146
<i>He was at the Biograph Theater
the night that Dillinger was killed.</i>

511
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:28,621
<i>It was a hot summer evening.
Little air conditioning in Chicago...</i>

512
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,683
<i>and people were out for a walk.</i>

513
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,804
<i>My father would tell me
that when Dillinger was killed...</i>

514
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,370
<i>within a matter of two minutes...</i>

515
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,179
<i>people were dipping their
handkerchiefs in the blood...</i>

516
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,179
to get souvenirs.

517
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,480
And he vividly remembered one lady...

518
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,889
who, all she had was a newspaper,
held it up and said:

519
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:06,225
"I bet I'm the only lady from Kansas
City with John Dillinger's blood."

520
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,696
<i>He told me, the "Woman in Red"...</i>

521
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:16,465
she had on an orange dress.
This is trivia, okay?

522
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,800
It looked red under the lights.
He said it was really orange.

523
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:23,608
So she got to be known as the
"Lady in Red" that fingered Dillinger.

524
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:26,241
<i>He said, "It was really the Lady in Orange."</i>

525
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,378
As her reward, she got a new fur coat...

526
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:33,855
and a one-way ticket
back to her native Romania.

527
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:45,828
His whole story
from the start was two hours late.

528
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,238
I met this kid
at around 10:00 in the morning.

529
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,668
He says we met at noon.

530
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:57,640
I say we were at the Bronco Bowl
at 2:00 or 3:00.

531
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,706
<i>He says it was 5:00 or 6:00.</i>

532
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:05,321
Everything that we did coincide with,
he was two hours late.

533
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:11,258
<i>Two hours later. Two hours into the night.</i>

534
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,228
<i>His testimony is that...</i>

535
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:18,735
<i>as we were getting off the freeway
on Inwood Avenue...</i>

536
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:21,899
he stated that I'm driving the car...

537
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,633
that we're pulled over.

538
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:27,603
He gets scared and he slumps down
in the seat of the car.

539
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,779
<i>That, as the officer walks up...</i>

540
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:45,254
<i>and shines his flashlight,
and I roll down my window...</i>

541
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,967
I pull the pistol out and blow this man away.

542
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,041
<i>His testimony is...</i>

543
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,974
when I finally do drive to the motel...

544
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,713
I get out. I tell him, "Don't worry about it.

545
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,718
"Forget this ever happened."

546
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,219
<i>That's crazy.</i>

547
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:17,126
The police officer was killed at 12:30...

548
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:20,357
which is about two and a half hours
after he last saw me.

549
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:26,602
<i>Just before he went into the motel...</i>

550
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,230
he'd gone across the motel courtyard...

551
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:32,434
to a little store over there
and bought some cigarettes.

552
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:36,306
And I was supposed to go and find out
if the man remembered him...

553
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,373
coming in there just before 10:00
to buy the cigarettes.

554
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:44,545
I didn't get over there
to Fort Worth for a long time.

555
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:49,248
<i>We got some pictures from his family
that didn't show him in jail clothes.</i>

556
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,726
<i>I took the pictures in to show them
to the man behind the counter.</i>

557
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:57,724
<i>He was very cooperative
and he wanted to help us.</i>

558
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,659
<i>But he honestly... He said:</i>

559
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,535
"I don't remember anything
about this guy coming in there...

560
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:06,770
"I couldn't tell one night from another.
Might have been that night or another.

561
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:09,074
"Cause they were always coming
for cigarettes."

562
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,742
His brother...

563
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,177
at first...

564
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:21,081
was saying that at the time
of the murder, that he was home...

565
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:26,986
watching... I believe it was
a wrestling match on TV.

566
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:32,099
And he said, "Me and my brother likes
wrestling matches. He was with me.

567
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,333
<i>"Randall, my brother,
was with me all night long.</i>

568
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,101
<i>"He couldn't have done it."</i>

569
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,275
<i>He was trying to cover for his brother.</i>

570
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:45,178
Later, as I recall, he changed...

571
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,045
because he said:

572
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:52,047
"If I get down there and perjure myself...

573
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:55,584
"there's nothing that they can do
because they've got the case."

574
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,059
This is the way I think that he thought.

575
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,789
"They know that my brother did it.

576
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:05,995
"If I get up there and lie,
they are going to have me for perjury.

577
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:09,665
"I'll be in the penitentiary with him,
and it ain't going to do any good...

578
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,141
"so I just ain't going to testify.
I ain't gonna say nothing."

579
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:16,235
So he backed off of his story completely...

580
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,573
and Adams was left without any witnesses.

581
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:30,382
Her in-court testimony
and her original statement...

582
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:31,951
which should be the best.

583
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:34,657
You're talking 15 to 20 minutes
after the killing.

584
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,565
Should be the best eyewitness
testimony she's got.

585
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,303
It doesn't match. Doesn't match at all.

586
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:01,180
<i>In court, she testified...</i>

587
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,417
he got out of the car, she got out of the car.

588
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:08,159
She positioned herself
at the back of the automobile.

589
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:25,244
Her original statement,
15 minutes after the killing...

590
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:28,140
<i>"a fur-lined collar on the killer."</i>

591
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:32,254
<i>In court, "It might have been bushy hair."</i>

592
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:36,289
The kid testified that I had a Levi jacket on...

593
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:39,862
which is the same type collar,
basically the same as this.

594
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:43,931
He testified at pretrial
that he had a fur-lined parka.

595
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,968
She's telling you who killed the man.

596
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:49,497
<i>One person in the car
with the fur-lined collar.</i>

597
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:04,509
Very convenient that the driver
happened to have bushy hair.

598
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:07,784
All she's got to do
is look at a picture they took of me.

599
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,221
But that is not her original statement.

600
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:14,025
It's a hell of a big difference
from "fur-lined collar" to "bushy hair."

601
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,291
<i>It's crazy.</i>

602
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:22,571
She went through
two weeks Internal Affairs...

603
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,937
when she comes out,
her testimony changes.

604
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:28,307
She goes in saying one thing,
she comes out saying another.

605
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,107
Something happened. What?

606
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,944
"We refreshed her memory."

607
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,891
Friday afternoon,
I think it was Good Friday...

608
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,018
we came back in the courtroom
that afternoon...

609
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,792
<i>and we were sort of elated
because we thought...</i>

610
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,561
<i>"He's gonna walk."</i>

611
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,900
And there's nothing really in that evidence.

612
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:57,202
There's just little David Harris,
and nobody believes him.

613
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:00,568
And so we were very optimistic
about his chances...

614
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,305
until we walked into the courtroom...

615
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,576
and here were all these people
standing in front of the bench.

616
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:06,980
Three of them, anyway.

617
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:10,151
<i>They were taking the oath
to be sworn as witnesses.</i>

618
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:14,984
<i>Mrs. Miller got on the stand
that last afternoon.</i>

619
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:19,688
And she said,
"That's the man, I saw that man!

620
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:23,221
<i>"I saw Randall Adams' face
just right after..."</i>

621
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,293
She said, "I saw the gun
sticking out of the car...

622
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:31,205
"when he shot that police officer.
And that's the man."

623
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,933
And she waved her finger
right toward Randall Adams.

624
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,275
<i>She's the one that got him convicted.</i>

625
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:40,416
When I was a kid,
I used to want to be a detective...

626
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:43,112
because I used to watch
all the detective shows on TV.

627
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,787
<i>When I was a kid they used to show
these movies with Boston Blackie...</i>

628
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:57,098
<i>and he always had a woman with him.</i>

629
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:01,566
I wanted to be a wife of a detective
or be a detective...

630
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:03,663
so I always watched detective stories.

631
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:11,545
I'm always looking because
I never know what might come up.

632
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,048
Or how I could help.

633
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:16,176
I like to help in situations like that.

634
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,180
I really do.

635
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,355
It's always happening to me,
everywhere I go...

636
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:27,761
lots of times there's killings or anything.

637
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,855
Even around my house. Wherever.

638
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:34,636
I'm always looking or getting involved,
to find out who did it, what's going on.

639
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,403
I listen to people.

640
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:48,042
And I'm always trying to decide
who's lying, or who killed who...

641
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,480
before the police do. See if I can beat them.

642
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:53,411
Yeah.

643
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:09,664
<i>I was working at a gas station.
My husband and I both.</i>

644
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,006
<i>We weren't getting along well at all.</i>

645
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,080
We were arguing back and forth.

646
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:21,447
We didn't wanna go home, because
we'd rather talk it out in the car...

647
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,247
than go home with the kids and fight.

648
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,753
Had to listen to them, too.

649
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:29,321
<i>So we were really arguing,
and decided to get something to eat.</i>

650
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:33,692
About that time,
a police came out of a restaurant...

651
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,698
on the right hand side of the road...

652
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,366
<i>and he went to pull the man over.</i>

653
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:50,913
She turned around.
She was looking hard. She looked.

654
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:54,977
I didn't think she seen the guy, but she did.

655
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:58,613
Because I said, "What you looking at?"
I knew something had went wrong.

656
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,713
She said, "You just shut up and drive."

657
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:06,955
And I kept telling my husband:
"Slow down so I can see."

658
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:10,466
He said, "Come on,
we're getting out of here.

659
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,697
"You're too nosy.
You don't even know what's going on."

660
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:19,842
I had no idea that somebody
was gonna get killed or shot.

661
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:22,144
So I just drove on.

662
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:29,215
He was one of these kind
that didn't like getting involved.

663
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:33,086
He wanted to go on. He told me
to shut up and turn around. Don't look.

664
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,884
I turned around and looked anyway.

665
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:45,596
So we heard something,
like backfire or firecrackers.

666
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:49,529
And so we drove over the bridge,
and I got to thinking.

667
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:53,337
I said: "Em, there're no firecrackers
this time of the year."

668
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,439
I was thinking to myself:

669
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:03,008
"That couldn't be somebody shooting."

670
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:10,287
It was real dark, and it was cold.

671
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,553
It was hard to see in that car.

672
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:17,355
But his window was down.
The driver's window was down.

673
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,667
This is how I got such a good look.

674
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:30,903
I really couldn't see anything inside.

675
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:34,815
It was kind of... shadows on the window
and stuff.

676
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:38,616
But when he rolled down the window,
what made his face stand out so.

677
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:40,280
The car was dark blue.

678
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:48,488
He had a beard, mustache...

679
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,565
kind of dishwater-blond hair.

680
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:56,769
But, like I said, when he was in court,
he sure looked a lot different.

681
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:02,036
All I could just tell by this and this,
that it was him.

682
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:08,979
I knew that there was some shots over there.

683
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:11,213
But I didn't want to be involved in it...

684
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,916
because West Dallas
is a high-crime neighborhood.

685
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,287
One of the biggest.

686
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,553
He was more scared of it than I was.

687
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:21,696
But when you have black people like that...

688
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:24,325
they don't like getting involved in nothing.

689
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,262
That's just common.

690
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,897
Like here, nobody wants
to see nothing or hear nothing.

691
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:33,402
And they'll stay completely
in the background.

692
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,205
That's why they were having
such a hard time there...

693
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:38,679
finding anybody that would come forward.

694
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:41,114
Because it was in
a totally black neighborhood.

695
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:50,021
<i>She believe in, see somebody done
something wrong she should tell it.</i>

696
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,152
'Cause she told on me...

697
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,592
a couple of times...

698
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:03,566
that I was hauling drugs out of El Paso.

699
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:07,808
Called the sheriff down there,
going to make me open my trunk.

700
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:12,472
So I ended up opening it,
but there was nothing in it.

701
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:19,650
Good grief.

702
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:24,357
She's a ho, but she find out
you done something, she turn you in.

703
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:34,664
Mrs. Miller had testified at the trial...

704
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:38,174
that she had gotten off early from her
gas station job...

705
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:42,041
and gone down to pick up her husband
to help him with the bookwork.

706
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,548
We found out that she was not doing
any bookkeeping for that station...

707
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:49,346
because she had been fired
from her job two weeks earlier...

708
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,410
for till-tapping, for stealing.

709
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:55,922
<i>The reason that they were
talking to the police at all...</i>

710
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:59,993
was that there'd been a three-day
running knife fight in their apartment.

711
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:01,963
And they were all booked...

712
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,933
for disorderly and drunk behavior in there...

713
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:08,459
including assault with knives,
and all kinds of stuff.

714
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:12,899
When they were at the police station,
they suddenly decided to volunteer...

715
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,444
all this information
about what they had seen...

716
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:17,844
<i>about the police officer's killing.</i>

717
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,484
A woman called me at my home...

718
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:23,679
and said that she knew this woman...

719
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:27,120
who had testified and identified
Randall Adams from a passing vehicle.

720
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,351
This woman had never told the truth
in her life.

721
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,759
<i>She also told me that she had tried
to call the D.A. During the trial...</i>

722
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:41,201
and give this evidence
that this woman was not believable.

723
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:45,230
If their case hinged on this testimony,
this was not believable testimony.

724
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:48,375
They were scum. They were just...

725
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:52,675
actually scum.

726
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:55,442
<i>He was a black man
and she was a white woman.</i>

727
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:57,978
<i>He came to work the day after.</i>

728
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:03,656
He told me about the policeman
that had gotten shot the night before.

729
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,752
And I hadn't heard anything about it.

730
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:08,954
<i>And I thought
it was another one of these stories.</i>

731
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:12,194
<i>And he brings in these newspapers...</i>

732
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:17,471
and he says he didn't see a thing.
He couldn't see nothing, it was dark.

733
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:20,770
<i>Wheels started rolling
in his head about money.</i>

734
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,911
<i>That's when he got the idea.</i>

735
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:29,080
Let me put it in his words.

736
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:32,016
For enough money, he would testify...

737
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,652
to what they wanted him to say.

738
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:37,959
He would say anything
they wanted him to say.

739
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:41,554
Or he would see anything
that they wanted him to see.

740
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,866
Those were his words.

741
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:50,534
I was shocked that he did go ahead...

742
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,937
and get up and tell
that he saw the actual shooting...

743
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:58,410
and recognized the boy. Identified him.

744
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:03,376
<i>That's when I called Dennis White.
I told him, "That man's lying."</i>

745
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,747
Nobody has that good of an eyesight.

746
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:17,290
From where the policeman was shot
and from where they were at...

747
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:22,771
I doubt if you could have
even seen them with binoculars.

748
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,543
<i>I'm a salesman.</i>

749
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,505
<i>And you develop something like total recall.</i>

750
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:35,650
I don't forget places, things...

751
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,413
or streets.

752
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:42,189
Because it's a habit,
something I just picked up.

753
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:45,694
I just stare intensely at people
and try to figure them out.

754
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:50,524
<i>Being nosy, I just stare.</i>

755
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:56,003
<i>I was leaving the Plush Pub one night...</i>

756
00:57:56,873 --> 00:58:01,606
driving a 1977 Cadillac...

757
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,610
<i>heading west on Hampton.</i>

758
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:08,313
I noticed an officer had
two individuals pulled over...

759
00:58:08,785 --> 00:58:11,310
to the curb in a blue...

760
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:13,821
<i>some type of vehicle.</i>

761
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:16,825
<i>It was a blue...</i>

762
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:22,186
It was a blue Ford. It was a blue something.

763
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:29,502
The driver, I think, had long blond hair
and a moustache.

764
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:32,439
And the other one
didn't have no hairs on his face.

765
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:40,741
<i>A person that is white
going through that area at night...</i>

766
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:44,317
he's a sore thumb,
he stick out for the first reason.

767
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:47,957
And if they don't look right,
they're gonna stop you.

768
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,756
<i>The officer, he walked up to the vehicle.</i>

769
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:57,156
<i>His car was behind...</i>

770
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:59,463
I don't know if it was behind or in front...

771
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,994
but I know he had him pulled over,
and he was up to the car.

772
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,971
I think he was up to the car. Let me think.

773
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:09,736
Yeah, he was up to the car.

774
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,549
As we was coming by
he had to have been up to the car.

775
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:24,491
I didn't see no bullet. I didn't see no gunfire.

776
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,222
Because I went on.

777
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:45,371
We have three people
that testified and identified him...

778
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:49,784
positively as being the driver
at the time that Wood was walking...

779
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:51,677
right beside the car.

780
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,724
So we know that he was the driver
from the witnesses...

781
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:57,359
and we also know...

782
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:00,519
that it was the driver
that shot Officer Wood...

783
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:02,556
coming from his partner.

784
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:05,457
<i>We couldn't have made a case...</i>

785
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:08,469
<i>with the voluntary statement
that we got from Adams.</i>

786
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,765
We had to rely on witnesses.

787
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:13,002
And this is what we did.

788
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:17,802
I always tried very hard,
every judge I know of does...

789
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,409
to not show emotion on the bench.

790
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,275
The reason, if you do show emotion...

791
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:27,081
the jury might take it that
you're favoring one side or another.

792
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:31,924
So you try to remain passive,
emotionless, objective.

793
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,128
I do have to admit that in the Adams case...

794
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:37,063
and I've never really said this...

795
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,830
Doug Mulder's final argument
was one I'd never heard before.

796
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:43,872
About the "thin blue line" of police...

797
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,534
that separated the public from anarchy.

798
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:51,202
I have to concede that there
my eyes kind of welled up...

799
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:52,904
when I heard that.

800
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:56,381
It did get to me emotionally,
but I don't think I showed it.

801
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,703
<i>In death penalty cases...</i>

802
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,071
we have a question, or we did at the time...

803
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,011
of whether or not that person
is of a dangerous mentality...

804
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:30,678
and might be expected
to commit other crimes.

805
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,583
<i>To answer that question...</i>

806
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:38,786
<i>the Dallas District Attorney sends
psychiatrists to the defendant's cell...</i>

807
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:41,056
to discover whether he is without remorse...

808
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,759
and therefore is a dangerous
and psychopathic personality.

809
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:47,759
Of course, in the instance of a person...

810
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:52,103
who did not commit the crime,
they're not going to show remorse.

811
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,705
<i>There were two psychiatrists
that appeared again and again.</i>

812
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:58,713
<i>Holbrook and Grigson, the "Killer Shrinks."</i>

813
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:03,948
There was certain criticism
directed against these two people...

814
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:10,617
because, in effect, whenever they
showed up, the purpose of their visit...

815
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:12,684
was to kill the defendant.

816
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:17,260
It was April 15th, tax day.

817
01:02:18,768 --> 01:02:21,498
I think I was filling out my taxes at the time.

818
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:23,331
Afraid I might be late.

819
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:27,099
A guard walks up to the door...

820
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:30,844
tells me, "There's someone out here
who wants to talk to you."

821
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:35,282
I ask him who it was.
He said he didn't know...

822
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:38,320
but the court ordered me to talk
to him. I said, "All right."

823
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:42,217
<i>And here come this real tall,
ostrich-looking dude.</i>

824
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:45,952
<i>He introduced himself as Dr. Grigson.</i>

825
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:50,423
He pulled a pad out of his coat pocket...

826
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,798
that had a line drawn across it.

827
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:57,229
On this pad, on the upper half...

828
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,905
he had six images.

829
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:03,577
I will say a box, a square,
a circle with a diamond in it.

830
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:06,114
<i>I don't... It's been awhile.</i>

831
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:10,980
<i>He slides this piece of paper across
to me and he hands me a pencil.</i>

832
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,881
<i>He says, "I'm going to get a cup of coffee.</i>

833
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:16,883
<i>"Please copy what's on this piece of paper."</i>

834
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:22,590
I'm looking at this man.

835
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:26,967
I said, "What? You want it copied
just the same way you did?

836
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:30,164
"Or you want me to change them
around? What do you want me to do?"

837
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:32,867
He said, "Just do
whatever you think you want to do."

838
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:34,068
And he left.

839
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:38,174
So on the bottom half
of this piece of paper...

840
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:41,508
I made my boxes and X's...

841
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:44,075
and zeros with diamonds in it.
Exactly like his.

842
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,018
He asked me...

843
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:53,050
"What's the meaning of
'A rolling stone gathers no moss?"'

844
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,959
I'm looking at this man.

845
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:59,632
I said, "Are you kidding? Is this
a joke? What are you doing?"

846
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:03,297
He said, "No, I really want to know
your answer to that question."

847
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:07,643
I said, well,
"A rolling stone gathers no moss."

848
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,644
I said, "To me...

849
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:14,142
"it would represent that a person
that doesn't stand still long enough...

850
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,285
"it's kind of hard for people to cling to him.

851
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:21,250
"If he keeps moving around,
it's hard to get close to him."

852
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:23,290
He shook his head.

853
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:27,723
He said, "What about 'A bird in
the hand is worth two in the bush"'?

854
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:32,490
I said, "If you have a hold of
something, why give it up...

855
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:35,765
"for a chance of getting something
that might be a little better?

856
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:39,433
"It doesn't make sense. You've got
something good, why let go of it?

857
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:41,908
"If you can get the other one,
get it if you can...

858
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:45,505
"but don't let go of what you got
to try to get something else."

859
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,911
He asked about my family.

860
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:51,143
He asked about my background.

861
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:53,950
And he left.

862
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:58,088
Total time we had talked,
maybe 15, 20 minutes.

863
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:05,423
Dr. Grigson was up there testifying
he would commit violent crimes...

864
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:07,594
in the future if he was released.

865
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:12,273
Grigson is known as "Dr. Death"
because he always testifies that way.

866
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,366
<i>In about 99% of the trials...</i>

867
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:17,674
<i>that he's been a witness for the
prosecution, he always testifies...</i>

868
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:21,012
<i>that they will commit
violent crimes in the future.</i>

869
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:25,285
<i>You can't tell what
somebody's gonna do years from now.</i>

870
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:27,014
<i>Not really.</i>

871
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:31,484
<i>Except based on your past record,
which anybody can do.</i>

872
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:38,325
Randall never had any prior record.

873
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:42,699
And as far as we know, he never had
any history of violence whatever.

874
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:47,875
Grigson testified for...

875
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:51,670
two and a half hours
about all these degrees he's got.

876
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:55,778
He's been here, and he's been there,
and he's studied here.

877
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:58,843
He called me Charlie Manson.

878
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:01,416
He called me Adolf Hitler.

879
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:04,357
He said I'm the type of personality...

880
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:07,827
that can work all day and creep all night.

881
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:12,196
He testified, Grigson...

882
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,341
that the future seriousness...

883
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:22,437
of my mental state...

884
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,409
would be such that if they released me...

885
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:28,348
I would go crazy and
probably butcher half of Dallas County.

886
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:31,045
Even though he talked to me 15 minutes...

887
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:35,420
I have no prior convictions,
no prior arrests...

888
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:38,322
I was nonviolent for 28 years.

889
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:39,759
On one instance...

890
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,855
and that's saying if I did this,
which I didn't...

891
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:47,460
<i>he's stating that, that's enough...
For the rest of my life, watch me.</i>

892
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:51,370
Don't ever turn your back on me.
And he talked to me 15 minutes.

893
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:55,000
He's crazy.

894
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:02,881
You can understand why a man
might steal if he needs money...

895
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:05,580
to put food on the table.

896
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:09,319
I can understand why a 17-year-old
boy who doesn't have a car...

897
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:11,257
would steal one to ride around in.

898
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:14,353
I can understand
why the heroin addict needs heroin.

899
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:18,790
But it's very hard to understand
why anybody has to kill a police officer.

900
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,998
It just doesn't have to be.

901
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:34,472
When I'm asleep
and I close my eyes and think...

902
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:35,847
"Why would he do it?

903
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:38,386
"He had no background
that would lead to murder...

904
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,547
"no reason to commit a murder."

905
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:43,452
And I look at the facts of the case and say...

906
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:47,425
David Harris knew the car was stolen,
knew the guns were there...

907
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:48,986
knew the guns were stolen...

908
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,033
was on a crime spree...

909
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:55,097
had had a criminal record prior to
stealing this car and these guns.

910
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,503
He was the one
that wanted to commit the murder...

911
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:58,904
and get away from the scene.

912
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:01,442
He was the one that,
after the murder was committed...

913
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:04,673
went right back home
and bragged about it to his friends.

914
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:08,473
I looked at all the evidence...

915
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:12,476
and I found that I believed
that David Harris committed murder.

916
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:16,222
The jury looked at the same evidence...

917
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:19,390
and found they believed that
Randall Adams committed murder.

918
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:22,025
<i>And it was their verdict that counted.</i>

919
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:48,713
You have a D. A...

920
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:52,551
he doesn't talk about...

921
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:55,788
when they convict you
or how they convict you...

922
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,125
he's talking about
how he's going to kill you.

923
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,461
He don't give a damn if you're innocent.

924
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:06,940
He don't give a damn if you're guilty.
He's talking about killing you.

925
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:17,213
<i>You get numb. You get...</i>

926
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:22,513
It's like a bad dream. You want
to wake up, but you can't do it.

927
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:31,058
Fifteen times, 20 times a day,
I hear this same story...

928
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:33,761
about what happens
when a man is electrocuted.

929
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:37,866
His eyeballs pop out.

930
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:39,870
His fingernails pop out.

931
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,533
His toenails pop out.

932
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:44,445
He bleeds out of every orifice he's got.

933
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,586
<i>They don't care...</i>

934
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,721
They don't care.

935
01:09:57,226 --> 01:10:00,423
All they want to do is talk about
how they're going to kill you.

936
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:03,863
That's the only thing that they cared
about and talked about.

937
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:08,600
At that point, that's all they're wanting.

938
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:17,574
I didn't have any idea
what happened to him.

939
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:21,676
<i>After I testified, I was gone.</i>

940
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:26,612
<i>I never really concerned myself with it.</i>

941
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,351
Maybe I didn't want to know. I don't know.

942
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:38,326
I didn't have any interest in knowing...

943
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,868
otherwise I might have tried to find out.

944
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:46,798
<i>Dennis filed the motion for a new trial...</i>

945
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:49,070
<i>then we filed an amended motion
for a new trial.</i>

946
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:51,908
<i>About 20 days later,
we were to have a hearing on it.</i>

947
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:55,774
<i>Both Robert Miller and his wife
testified there.</i>

948
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:57,876
But we could not bring out the fact...

949
01:10:57,953 --> 01:11:01,582
that they had said that they were
gonna get that reward money...

950
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:04,888
and that they didn't care
whether they saw anything or not...

951
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,451
but their car was too steamed up.

952
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:10,856
We were not allowed to get any of that in...

953
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:13,493
because it was held
that it was impeaching testimony...

954
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:15,560
and therefore it came too late.

955
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:18,466
<i>We kept running into blank walls.</i>

956
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:23,400
<i>A reporter from the Dallas Morning News...</i>

957
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:27,573
discovered that one week
after the trial was over with...

958
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:32,147
the daughter of this woman
had a robbery case in this court.

959
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:33,779
<i>She offered her testimony...</i>

960
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:37,223
<i>at a time when her daughter
was in danger of going to jail for life...</i>

961
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,386
<i>and got her daughter out of jail.</i>

962
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:41,257
How can you believe her...

963
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:44,763
when the very next week
the same judge dismisses that case?

964
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:51,695
The Millers are the kind of people
that would do anything...

965
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:54,238
if there was something to be gained...

966
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:58,709
such as her daughter not being sent
to the penitentiary for armed robbery...

967
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:00,248
or for money.

968
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:05,177
<i>When we went to court that day,
the District Attorney was hard-nosed.</i>

969
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:07,586
<i>Wouldn't let me answer any questions.</i>

970
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:11,626
He'd ask me questions,
but then he'd cut me off real short.

971
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:15,625
And that's when he said something
about my big fat nose.

972
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:18,189
If I'd kept my big fat nose
out of their business...

973
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:20,292
the Millers would be better off.

974
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:24,735
<i>When I started to leave
out of the courtroom...</i>

975
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:27,241
he started laughing, like:

976
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:29,777
"Didn't do you any good to get up here."

977
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:32,575
It really didn't. Didn't help the guy at all.

978
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:42,123
To the best of my recollection...

979
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:44,523
the brief conversations
I have had with Mr. Adams...

980
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:46,288
and they have been brief...

981
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:49,889
I don't even recall ever asking him,
or my having told me...

982
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:52,057
that he did not do it.

983
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:57,234
Because, for my purposes,
representing him on appeal...

984
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,835
<i>it's totally irrelevant.</i>

985
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:06,273
When the Court of Criminal Appeals
of Texas...

986
01:13:07,983 --> 01:13:12,249
voted 9-0 against us,
I was a little upset about that.

987
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:14,346
I felt we, A: Should have won...

988
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:16,891
B: Certainly shouldn't have been
slapped so hard...

989
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:19,052
with the unanimous decision against us.

990
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,893
I was with my family in an ice-cream parlor...

991
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:28,562
and the judge and his family
happened to come at the same time.

992
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:32,733
And he came over to me
and made the comment...

993
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:38,740
"I see where the Court of Criminal
Appeals gave me an 'A'...

994
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:40,706
"in the Adams case."

995
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,278
Our highest state appellate court...

996
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:47,413
the Court of Criminal Appeals
in Austin affirmed the case, 9-0.

997
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:51,550
Then it was reversed by the
United States Supreme Court, 8-1...

998
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:56,126
When the Appellate Court reverses a case...

999
01:13:56,765 --> 01:14:00,223
they are never saying
the trial judge was right or wrong.

1000
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:03,429
They are saying
they disagree with the judge.

1001
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:07,403
You can't, for instance,
in the Adams appeals...

1002
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:11,476
say the appellate courts
were saying I was right or I was wrong.

1003
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:14,773
After all, if in Austin...

1004
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:18,244
in our state appeals court,
I was 9-0 correct...

1005
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,551
and in Washington, I was 1-8 incorrect.

1006
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:24,992
If you tally all those votes, I come out 10-8.

1007
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:27,058
<i>Yet the case was reversed.</i>

1008
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:34,027
Eight justices of the Supreme Court
were the first people to agree with me.

1009
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:39,006
They're the only people anywhere
that ever agreed about that statute...

1010
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,609
<i>were eight justices of the Supreme Court.</i>

1011
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:48,315
<i>The Dallas Morning News
had a very nice front-page story...</i>

1012
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:51,377
either the same day...

1013
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:54,945
or the day after the reversal was
announced by the Supreme Court...

1014
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:58,083
in which Henry Wade, the District Attorney...

1015
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,251
<i>vowed a retrial of Randall Dale Adams...</i>

1016
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:05,566
<i>because there was no room
in his book for a cop-killer...</i>

1017
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:08,797
<i>getting off with anything less
than the death penalty.</i>

1018
01:15:09,738 --> 01:15:13,105
I took that to heart. I thought
I was going to get my chance.

1019
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:17,968
For reasons
that were never really made public...

1020
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:21,942
Mr. Wade requested
the governor to commute...

1021
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:24,947
Mr. Adams' death penalty to life...

1022
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:29,652
and that eliminated
the possibility of a retrial...

1023
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:31,056
based on the reversal.

1024
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:35,324
<i>I was absolutely shocked.</i>

1025
01:15:35,797 --> 01:15:37,287
I can't help but believe...

1026
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:40,199
that some of the motivation
behind that decision...

1027
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:41,759
was a fear that...

1028
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:45,369
Adams may be vindicated at a retrial.

1029
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:50,000
I just felt they prosecuted
the wrong person. I don't know why.

1030
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:54,671
I felt that some policeman,
whether in Vidor or in Dallas...

1031
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:59,818
made a decision to prosecute and set
the wheels of justice in motion...

1032
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:03,654
in the wrong direction and they got
going so fast no one could stop them.

1033
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:06,489
So I felt it was up to me
to stop them and I didn't.

1034
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:10,692
I felt it was up to the Supreme Court
and they did what they could, but...

1035
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:13,758
it's all gotten messed up and derailed again.

1036
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:19,931
<i>Since his trial, I have given up
my practice of criminal law.</i>

1037
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:25,040
I have not had a jury trial...

1038
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:28,139
since I heard the verdict
of this jury in this case...

1039
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:30,308
and don't intend to.

1040
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,778
I just feel like...

1041
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:38,087
I'll let other people
handle these problems for a while.

1042
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:43,857
Because if justice can miscarry so badly...

1043
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:46,867
I'd rather do something else.

1044
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:50,869
Prosecutors in Dallas have said for years...

1045
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:54,167
"Any prosecutor can convict a guilty man.

1046
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:57,641
"It takes a great prosecutor
to convict an innocent man."

1047
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:03,481
To this day, I think Mr. Mulder...

1048
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:08,383
believes that the Adams conviction
was one of his great victories...

1049
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:13,884
probably because of some reservations
he has about Adams' guilt.

1050
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:23,037
I got a call one morning,
a lady here in Vidor...

1051
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,202
had been hit over the head
with a rolling pin...

1052
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:30,743
and the attacker thought
she'd been knocked unconscious...

1053
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:32,637
when, in reality, she wasn't.

1054
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:35,581
And she recognized the attacker
to be David Harris.

1055
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,382
He voluntarily came to the police station.

1056
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:45,426
I told him,
"David, this girl knows who you are.

1057
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,792
"I don't even have to tell you
I know the truth.

1058
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:49,592
"You know I know the truth this time."

1059
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:54,466
He said, "I was wrong.
I smoked marijuana, I was drinking.

1060
01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:57,596
"I don't know what got over me
but something just came over me."

1061
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:01,541
<i>But he forgot to mention one thing,
that he was only wearing underwear.</i>

1062
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:06,908
I felt as though
the attack was sexually oriented.

1063
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:09,075
He never wanted to admit that...

1064
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:12,382
and, as I recall,
he never really finally admitted it.

1065
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:14,615
He'd just get to where he wouldn't deny it.

1066
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:17,456
<i>He posted his bond and went to Germany.</i>

1067
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:22,228
We had a crime
with basically the same M.O. As his...

1068
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:26,324
and so it led me to want to check
and see if he was in town.

1069
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:29,762
I contacted the Worldwide Military Locator...

1070
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:32,238
to see if, through the military,
I could locate him.

1071
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:35,333
<i>I did, and found out
that he was in prison at the time.</i>

1072
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:38,175
<i>He really didn't remember what happened.</i>

1073
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:40,339
<i>He said he woke up in the stockade...</i>

1074
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:43,873
<i>and he'd been told that he beat up
one of his ranking officers.</i>

1075
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:48,180
We had another occasion
to have a crime that fit his M.O. A lot...

1076
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:51,191
so I started looking for him again,
and this time...

1077
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:53,159
I found him in prison in California.

1078
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:56,891
<i>So I realized again that unfortunately,
he hadn't straightened up.</i>

1079
01:18:56,965 --> 01:18:58,796
<i>He was still having a lot of problems.</i>

1080
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,104
I was 16 years old.

1081
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:14,275
I really didn't have no real dealings
with the court systems, etc.

1082
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:17,912
Didn't know how they worked, really.

1083
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:20,244
Didn't know much about the law.

1084
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:22,687
<i>Just a young, dumb kid.</i>

1085
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:28,723
Police give you the time of this
and the time this happened...

1086
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:31,129
and you just correlate from those events.

1087
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:34,293
You just estimate from that event
what time it was.

1088
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:36,434
<i>You don't know.</i>

1089
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:38,564
<i>You're taking a guess.</i>

1090
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:44,236
<i>Police tell you, "It was 12:30
when this crime happened.</i>

1091
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:52,445
<i>"What time did you leave the movie?"</i>

1092
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:55,489
<i>"I know it was somewhere around midnight.</i>

1093
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:03,226
<i>"It might have been before then.
I don't know.</i>

1094
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:05,232
<i>"I didn't have a watch on."</i>

1095
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:20,937
<i>He went over my testimony with me
pretty extensively.</i>

1096
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:25,151
How I should answer certain questions...

1097
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:29,088
things of this nature.

1098
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:32,183
That's what you call "coaching the witness."

1099
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:37,027
<i>Let's get this evidence in a spectrum
where it's going to be most effective.</i>

1100
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:47,773
At the time, I didn't really ponder on it...

1101
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:57,115
but he was deceiving the jury.
He wanted to deceive justice.

1102
01:20:57,586 --> 01:21:01,249
That's why I think
that statue with the scales...

1103
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:04,654
Justice? What is she called?
I don't know what she's called.

1104
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:07,188
She's got that blindfold on.

1105
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:10,861
<i>We don't see what goes on
behind the closed doors.</i>

1106
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,427
<i>I had another woman in the car.</i>

1107
01:21:15,437 --> 01:21:18,702
<i>I didn't tell them about that.
My wife'd kill me.</i>

1108
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:23,343
She would've tore my head off if she
knew I was out with another woman.

1109
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:24,969
Would you tell?

1110
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:28,882
That's what happened.
I was trying to get her home.

1111
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:34,317
The driver's side was down because...

1112
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:38,488
the lady was a little sick.
She needed some air.

1113
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:41,222
Because she was pretty drunk.

1114
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:51,905
<i>See, the Millers,
one is black and one is white.</i>

1115
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:55,636
<i>They said I was going with...
The reason I was over that night...</i>

1116
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:57,974
I was over there
messing with this man's wife.

1117
01:21:58,046 --> 01:22:01,846
<i>And I ain't never gone with her in
my life. She was too old and ugly.</i>

1118
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:06,954
Like I said, the D.A. Will
put something into their mouth.

1119
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:09,650
They could have
prefabricated the whole story.

1120
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:12,587
They sure could have.

1121
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:15,323
But what I saw is just what I saw.
That was it.

1122
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:18,365
So if they got paid, they got paid for lying.

1123
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:24,939
They already decided
what to do with you in the hall.

1124
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:29,332
That's why they call it the Hall of
Justice, the scales are not balanced.

1125
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:32,580
The scales are in the hall,
and they go up and down.

1126
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:36,879
They might go up for you, favor one
way, they might go down against you.

1127
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:41,412
<i>So if the D.A. Wants you to hang
15 or 20 years, you're hung.</i>

1128
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:47,658
I had all these charges
still pending in Orange County.

1129
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:54,224
I could have been certified as an adult...

1130
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:58,137
maybe given a life sentence. I don't know.

1131
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,800
I'm 16 years old. I know I don't want that.

1132
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:07,173
<i>That District Attorney told me,
"Don't worry about them charges."</i>

1133
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:12,048
<i>"I'm gonna ask your...
Defense Attorney is gonna ask you...</i>

1134
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:14,787
"if you had any kind of deal...

1135
01:23:15,857 --> 01:23:18,052
"or anything of that nature...

1136
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:22,028
"in exchange for your testimony
in this case...

1137
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:24,522
"as relating to those charges.

1138
01:23:27,102 --> 01:23:30,833
"Don't answer that 'Yes.' Answer it 'No."'

1139
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,707
My husband,
he didn't get that good a look at him.

1140
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:45,417
He wasn't sure, because they put
a bunch of them that looked alike.

1141
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:50,322
<i>They had about three or four
in the lineup that had bushy hair...</i>

1142
01:23:50,392 --> 01:23:54,351
but he had his combed down,
different to what it was in the killing.

1143
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:57,831
I didn't pick him out right then...

1144
01:23:58,099 --> 01:24:00,363
because I picked out this bushy-haired man.

1145
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:08,172
I understand one other witness
did pick out the man at the lineup.

1146
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:11,136
I'm not sure, but I think he did.

1147
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:14,913
Of course I picked out
Randall Adams just like that.

1148
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:18,885
I don't know about the others.

1149
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:22,479
Evidently they did at that time.

1150
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:47,105
<i>I just took off.</i>

1151
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:50,183
It's like, kids run away...

1152
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:52,845
they don't think about
where they're going to stay...

1153
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:56,220
how they're going to eat, all these things.

1154
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:02,159
They had that roof over their head
all their lives.

1155
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:04,494
They don't really think about those things...

1156
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:07,933
till you get out there and you say,
"My stomach's growling now."

1157
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:12,799
<i>Or, "It's getting cold out here. It's raining."</i>

1158
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:18,740
<i>There was ice on the road.</i>

1159
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:23,474
I remember there was a car coming
pretty fast up the road behind me...

1160
01:25:24,419 --> 01:25:27,149
and didn't see me or something...

1161
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:30,783
or was in one lane and came into
the other lane and I was in that lane...

1162
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:33,623
and tried to stop me.
He went off the side of the road.

1163
01:25:33,695 --> 01:25:36,061
I remember this car
went off the side of the road.

1164
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:38,156
I'm just looking back.

1165
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:44,228
I remember that.

1166
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:53,107
I got a call at my house
about 3:30 one morning.

1167
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:56,215
One of the patrolmen
in my department called...

1168
01:25:56,484 --> 01:26:00,045
and said, "We just arrested
this boy named David Harris...

1169
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:04,054
"and he won't even tell us his name.
He said he wants to talk to you."

1170
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:07,925
<i>They told me something that really
made me interested. He'd been shot.</i>

1171
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:12,557
David had initially told me
that he had gone to a bar in Houston...

1172
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:18,162
and was flirting with a young lady
and her boyfriend became upset...

1173
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:22,232
and chased him out with a pistol,
shooting at him.

1174
01:26:25,113 --> 01:26:26,842
<i>We knew that wasn't true.</i>

1175
01:26:27,148 --> 01:26:29,639
I said, "David, I know you're lying to me.

1176
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:33,777
"We go through this all the time,
all my dealings with you in the past.

1177
01:26:34,389 --> 01:26:36,323
"I don't know what you've done just yet.

1178
01:26:36,391 --> 01:26:37,619
"I know you were shot.

1179
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:41,025
"I know you were shot doing something
that you shouldn't have been...

1180
01:26:41,095 --> 01:26:44,792
<i>"we know you burglarized a gun shop.
We know you were driving drunk.</i>

1181
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:49,560
"Got witnesses who can identify you,
who can identify your truck."

1182
01:26:49,737 --> 01:26:52,968
I said, "You're caught. So tell the truth."

1183
01:26:53,341 --> 01:26:55,536
And David said, "Okay, I killed him."

1184
01:26:59,314 --> 01:27:03,273
<i>Their home was entered while he
and his girlfriend were there alone.</i>

1185
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,320
<i>The man was sent into the bathroom
at gunpoint and told to stay there.</i>

1186
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:15,153
<i>David took the girl
and was starting to leave.</i>

1187
01:27:16,097 --> 01:27:18,930
<i>The man exited the apartment with a gun.</i>

1188
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:23,336
The man fell to the ground,
or near the ground...

1189
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:27,067
holding onto a pole there in the
parking lot of the apartment complex...

1190
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:30,804
and these last, whether it be two,
three, or how many shots...

1191
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:34,473
I don't know, were fired at point-blank
or near point-blank range.

1192
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:42,147
David thought that the one
that was really at fault that night...

1193
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:45,283
was the guy that got killed.
He said, "That guy's crazy.

1194
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,850
"He came after me with a gun."

1195
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:49,488
I told him,
"David, you'd broken into his house...

1196
01:27:49,564 --> 01:27:52,624
"you abducted his girlfriend,
what was he supposed to do?"

1197
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:55,362
He said,
"Man shouldn't come out with a gun.

1198
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:57,836
"That dude's crazy.
He should have been killed."

1199
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:03,477
<i>When we went to retrieve the pistol...</i>

1200
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:05,476
I had to go into the water to get it.

1201
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:08,447
It was a bayou and it was grassy,
snaky-looking area.

1202
01:28:08,516 --> 01:28:10,746
I was not real pleased
about being there myself...

1203
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:14,310
but David enjoyed watching me have to
go down there and look for the gun.

1204
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:17,756
I'd been searching several minutes,
he was up on the bridge...

1205
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:20,083
and probably 25 feet from me...

1206
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:24,561
directing me to where he thought
that the gun had landed in the water.

1207
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:29,068
<i>He was handcuffed.</i>

1208
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:31,935
Traffic would come by,
and he would turn around...

1209
01:28:32,106 --> 01:28:35,098
and show them his handcuffs
and holler at them, "Help me!

1210
01:28:35,176 --> 01:28:38,077
"The officials will throw me
in this water and drown me."

1211
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:41,448
<i>Just anything he could do
to make a joke and cut up out there.</i>

1212
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:43,575
<i>He was just really having a good time.</i>

1213
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:49,112
The kid scares me.

1214
01:28:50,858 --> 01:28:54,919
To think that he could actually be
out there, walking the streets...

1215
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:57,430
and Dallas County let him go.

1216
01:28:57,665 --> 01:29:00,190
The kid had seven crimes
coming down on him.

1217
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:05,833
He had armed robberies.
He had firing on a peace officer.

1218
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:09,710
He had breaking and enterings,
aggravated assaults.

1219
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:11,677
God knows what all this kid had.

1220
01:29:11,746 --> 01:29:14,909
And Dallas County gives him
complete immunity for his testimony.

1221
01:29:14,982 --> 01:29:16,176
Just lets him walk.

1222
01:29:27,228 --> 01:29:29,423
<i>My mom had a good phrase.</i>

1223
01:29:29,597 --> 01:29:33,192
She said the first night
she pulled into Dallas, it was raining...

1224
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:34,893
and that it was lightning.

1225
01:29:35,169 --> 01:29:37,399
And they're coming into Dallas...

1226
01:29:37,472 --> 01:29:41,135
and she said if there was ever
a hell on earth, it's Dallas County.

1227
01:29:44,178 --> 01:29:45,736
She's right.

1228
01:29:57,992 --> 01:30:02,588
You deal with people who you sense
bad vibrations, more or less.

1229
01:30:02,663 --> 01:30:05,962
You feel, this guy doesn't like me
anyway because I'm a policeman.

1230
01:30:06,033 --> 01:30:09,935
You can just kind of sense something.
Maybe I shouldn't even be saying it...

1231
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:12,973
because police shouldn't
take these things to the bank.

1232
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:17,500
When you deal with people over
and over, you sense a lot of things.

1233
01:30:17,845 --> 01:30:21,645
<i>Talking to David, you don't ever
feel hostile feelings coming from him.</i>

1234
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:24,912
I have never seen David any way...

1235
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:28,522
other than cordial,
friendly to me as he could be:

1236
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:33,153
"Yes, sir." "No, sir." Never disrespectful.

1237
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:36,630
I've never seen the bad side.
I've seen the results...

1238
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:39,461
and I've talked to him about it,
and he's aware of it.

1239
01:30:39,534 --> 01:30:41,627
He remembers the bad side.

1240
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:45,565
But I've never seen him
committing a crime...

1241
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:48,632
or in a violent or volatile state.

1242
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,544
<i>When his crimes were confessed to...</i>

1243
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:59,181
he seemed to feel better and do better
during those times.

1244
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,387
His parents would tell me
he would to do better at home...

1245
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:05,551
he seemed to get along better
with the people in town...

1246
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:07,321
his neighbors and friends.

1247
01:31:07,495 --> 01:31:09,486
But something happens to David...

1248
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:13,660
I don't know what it is. I don't know
if anybody can put their finger on it.

1249
01:31:18,973 --> 01:31:21,840
<i>But there's no other indication
of anything in the family...</i>

1250
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:25,845
<i>that would lead you to believe
he had exposure to these activities.</i>

1251
01:31:32,019 --> 01:31:35,648
David's got at least one other brother
and sister that I know of.

1252
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:39,987
And he had one brother that drowned
numerous years ago.

1253
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:48,726
I was 3 years old...

1254
01:31:49,403 --> 01:31:51,303
I had a 4-year-old brother...

1255
01:31:51,939 --> 01:31:55,102
and he drowned in 1963...

1256
01:31:56,477 --> 01:31:59,537
<i>right after President Kennedy
was assassinated, I believe.</i>

1257
01:31:59,614 --> 01:32:02,139
<i>Sometime right after that,
during the summer.</i>

1258
01:32:02,984 --> 01:32:06,215
<i>We was living in Beaumont
on Harrison Street...</i>

1259
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:10,788
<i>and my dad was working on his truck
out in the yard...</i>

1260
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:14,986
<i>and mom was in the house
doing her housework or fixing dinner.</i>

1261
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:19,831
<i>Me and my brother, we had
one of these little blow-up pools...</i>

1262
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:22,999
<i>and we were playing in that.</i>

1263
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:27,997
<i>My dad was supposed to be watching
or keeping an eye on us or something.</i>

1264
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:31,009
<i>My brother wandered off down the street...</i>

1265
01:32:31,078 --> 01:32:33,808
<i>and these people had a
swimming pool in their backyard...</i>

1266
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:36,611
<i>and they were elderly people.
They never used the pool.</i>

1267
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:39,482
<i>I guess it had a bunch of leaves
and stuff in it.</i>

1268
01:32:42,657 --> 01:32:45,285
<i>And he, evidently, fell in there and drowned.</i>

1269
01:32:48,796 --> 01:32:53,028
I used to sit up in my room at night
and talk to him and he wasn't there.

1270
01:32:57,004 --> 01:33:01,566
So that might have been some kind of
a traumatic experience for me.

1271
01:33:03,744 --> 01:33:05,143
<i>I guess my dad...</i>

1272
01:33:08,816 --> 01:33:11,910
I don't know, maybe he couldn't
get rid of the responsibility...

1273
01:33:11,986 --> 01:33:14,887
or the guilt or something.
I don't know what it was.

1274
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:20,051
I was there and I guess maybe
I reminded him of that...

1275
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:22,129
all the time, growing up.

1276
01:33:24,465 --> 01:33:27,025
It was hard for me
to get any acceptance from him.

1277
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:30,831
<i>When my younger brother was born...</i>

1278
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:34,773
<i>it was kind of like he was Daddy's
favorite or something, I don't know.</i>

1279
01:33:37,745 --> 01:33:40,305
Everybody's life is going to take
some kind of path...

1280
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:42,178
regardless of what happens.

1281
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:48,820
I think maybe that a lot of the things
I did when I was younger...

1282
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:53,559
was an attempt to get back at him
or something...

1283
01:33:54,228 --> 01:33:55,957
for the way he treated me.

1284
01:33:57,732 --> 01:34:00,360
But I wasn't doing nothing
but hurting myself.
