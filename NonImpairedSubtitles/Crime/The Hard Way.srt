00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,439
Me, the agent that mismanaged
you all the way to No. 1.

156
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,791
All right. Fine, let's talk about
something that matters.

157
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,194
Let's talk about...

158
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,108
<i>(both) $1.2 billion in
combined ticket sales.</i>

159
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,835
Not to mention $7 million
pay-or-play, or 12% of the gross.

160
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,430
You've never been bigger. They're
bootlegging your movies to Libya.

161
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,189
Fabulous. I've cornered the terrorist
market. How am I doing in Iraq?

162
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,074
The problem is
I'm tired of playing cartoons.

163
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,955
You don't want me to grow up.
The studio doesn't want me to grow up.

164
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,389
I'm the only one
who wants me to grow up!

165
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,032
Let's cut through it.
It's that part, isn't it?

166
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,720
You still wanna play
that cop, Ray Casanova.

167
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,274
Casanov, Ray Casanov.
And you're damn right.

168
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,960
Come on, Gupta, get the kind
with the fresh ones!

169
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,834
Damn right I want to! You know why?
Because that's a real guy.

170
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,791
He worries about paying the rent...

171
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,639
...he bleeds when he gets shot,
pukes when he gets sick.

172
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,356
Nick! Spielberg's wife just had a baby.
Should I send that wine and cheese?

173
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,075
Yeah, and some of those muffins
and a note, something personal.

174
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,192
Not too personal. He forgot
to mention me in his AFI speech.

175
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,276
- Add my name.
- OK.

176
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,916
People come to see your movies
because you make them happy.

177
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,352
Call me crazy, but I don't see America
coming out in droves to see you puke.

178
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,118
Besides, they want
Mel Gibson for the role.

179
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,755
- Is it about asses? Is it a butt movie?
- Get up, get up.

180
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,236
The director'll be back in two weeks.

181
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,920
- They'll close the deal.
- Good afternoon, Mr Lang.

182
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,917
Wait a minute. Did you say two weeks?

183
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,476
Two weeks is perfect. Two weeks is
enough. I wanna test for the part.

184
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,352
Test? No, no.

185
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,789
- Ange, listen to me.
- You listen to me!

186
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,115
My mind is made up.
This means too much to me.

187
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,800
I'll pay for the damn test myself!

188
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,870
They'll try to get you
for less, a lot less.

189
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,390
Ange, please, hold it for one second.
Let me show you something.

190
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,675
Rosalie, please, can you... I got this
off the dish last night. You gotta watch it.

191
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,793
<i>(TV) Four times this Party Crasher
has alerted you...</i>

192
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,354
<i>...before killing someone,
and he still got away.</i>

193
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,870
<i>- You care to comment on that?
- Tie your dick in a knot!</i>

194
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,072
Freeze! Slow-mo, slow-mo.

195
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,069
- Isn't that incredible?
- Uh-huh.

196
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,070
Research, Ange.

197
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,191
Look at this face. Look at those eyes.

198
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,517
That's my character. That's my guide.
That's Ray Casanov.

199
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,200
That's the face of a man
who's been to the edge...

200
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,835
...a man who's tasted fear!
- And vomit.

201
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,629
I wanna go to New York tonight.
Call the studio. Get 'em to set it up.

202
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,873
I wanna spend two weeks with this guy.
I wanna eat, sleep, breathe John Moss.

203
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,719
If I can taste his world,
if I can walk his beat...

204
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,593
...if I can get under his skin,
I will nail this part.

205
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,518
- Nickie, I love you.
- I love you too, Ange.

206
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,429
Reality check - you can't leave town.
Your movie opens Friday.

207
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,438
- So what?
- I already booked Johnny, Barbara...

208
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,154
...Phil, Arsenio. Woo-woo-woo-woo!

209
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,589
Tell 'em to run an old one.
They're all the same.

210
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,280
- They just ask about the paternity suit.
- Suits.

211
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,994
What if this cop doesn't
want you tagging after him?

212
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,716
Ange, get real. Two pros exchanging ideas.
Why wouldn't he wanna do it?

213
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,717
Bullshit!
I mean that with all due respect.

214
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,233
There's no way on earth I am gonna
baby-sit some Hollywood rump wrangler.

215
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,478
- I'm on a murder investigation.
- You have no vote. You're off the case.

216
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,310
Look at you. You're all busted up.

217
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,034
If it weren't for Lang,
you'd be on injured leave.

218
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,435
Christ, you can't pull me off this case.

219
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,279
This Party Crasher has
whacked out seven people...

220
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,356
...four of 'em in front of us!

221
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,835
He's nuts! I looked in his eyes.
Know what I saw?

222
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,599
Pleasure. He likes it.
He's gonna do it again. Soon.

223
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,837
Moss, you're off.
Mayor Dinkins insisted.

224
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,556
Evidently this Hollywood actor
asked for you by name.

225
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,354
- What?
- Yes. Come in.

226
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,358
Benny. Wait for me outside.
I gotta talk to you.

227
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,509
All right, here's the story.
Pooley takes over for you.

228
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,712
You are breaking in a new
partner named Ray Casanov.

229
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,116
The guy just wants to blend in,
be another cop on the job...

230
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,196
...so nobody knows he's Nick Lang.

231
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,357
- Yes, sir.
- And Moss, no action.

232
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,916
<i>This guy gets his hair
messed up, we're all in deep shit.</i>

233
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,393
Yes, sir.

234
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,432
- Hey, John.
- Captain?

235
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,394
You got two ways to deal with this. You
got the easy way, you got the hard way.

236
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,991
John, do us all a favour
and make the right choice.

237
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,078
- I always do.
- Good.

238
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,516
Son of a bitch!

239
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,473
Hi, I'm looking
for Lieutenant Moss.

240
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,150
Oh, God. You...

241
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,356
He's over there relaxin'.

242
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,518
<i>- (Billy) Moss!
- What? What?</i>

243
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,716
You got company.

244
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,636
Hi, John.

245
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,869
Susan. Hi, I...

246
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,597
...didn't expect to see
you here this morning.

247
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,674
- Thank you, Billy.
- Aw, wanna be alone?

248
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,674
I tried calling you yesterday
and this morning.

249
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,509
I got your messages. I would have called
you at home, but I lost your number.

250
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,596
That happens. I lost my keys last week.

251
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,952
- Actually, my daughter Bonnie lost it.
- You know, kids.

252
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,280
Yeah. I wanted to let you know I wasn't
mad, even though you didn't show up.

253
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,269
I didn't think you were one of those
Cro-Magnon jerks who stands people up.

254
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,071
- These are yours, right?
- No, I quit. I don't smoke.

255
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,593
Hi.

256
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,358
Thank you, Benny.

257
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,754
- Bye.
- Bye.

258
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,428
Anyway, I know where you work
cos I saw you on the news.

259
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,240
- You did?
- Yeah.

260
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,999
Good thing Bonnie didn't see you.
I read lips.

261
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,509
Oh, no. That was taken
out of context.

262
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,952
Those reporters can be
real assholes, real irritating.

263
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,796
Hey, hey.

264
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,749
- I wanted to see how you were doin'.
- I'm OK. I'm doing good.

265
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,956
It's not like I wanted to go out...

266
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,197
...tonight... around 8.00.

267
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,356
Oh! Oh. Yeah, well.

268
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,755
So what are you doing
for dinner tonight?

269
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,711
- Tonight?
- Around 8.00.

270
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,479
As a matter of fact, I have no plans.

271
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,429
Great. I'll call you, and we'll make
a plan for a place to go.

272
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,511
OK. All right.

273
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,916
<i>(whistling)</i>

274
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,435
Give me a kiss, baby.
Take a bow, baby.

275
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,790
<i>(Benny) Yeah, yeah! Way to go.</i>

276
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,909
Hey, Moss, heard you got yanked. Sorry.

277
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,076
Hey, that's too bad, John.

278
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,394
You gotta be Casanov.

279
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,516
Fucking A.

280
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,517
Hey, Casanov. You look
a lot like that actor.

281
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,234
- Yeah, Nick Lang.
- Only shorter.

282
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,592
<i>(Grainy) A lot shorter.</i>

283
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,439
OK, ladies, let's get
some real work done here.

284
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,111
Tea break's over. Party Crasher briefing
in the squad room. Let's go.

285
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,471
Psst.

286
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,636
I really am Nick Lang.

287
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,392
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

288
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,996
Aagh!

289
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,278
Lieutenant Moss, I haven't been
this jazzed since the Golden Globes.

290
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,755
I mean, a cop like you
showing me the streets.

291
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,236
The two of us comparing scars.
I have had a couple of scrapes myself.

292
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,909
<i>I got rope burns on Smoking Gun II.
I chafed for a month. It was terrible.</i>

293
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,157
This place is great.
The look, the textures...

294
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,872
<i>- (farts)
... the aroma.</i>

295
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,549
I mean, it's like a movie,
it's so real.

296
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,399
And you don't have
to worry about me screwing up.

297
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,149
I did my homework. I know
police procedures, police lingo...

298
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,236
Hey, homeboy!

299
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,279
I'm in great shape. My trainer's
got me on Nautilus and the StairMaster...

300
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,630
...so you don't have
to worry about Nick Lang.

301
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,435
Son of a bitch!
Caught me off guard there.

302
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,871
You know, Lieutenant,
I can't help but notice...

303
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,675
...that I'm doing most of
the talking here, which is fine.

304
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,837
I guess you're not a morning
person, and can I relate to that!

305
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,875
Before Esperanza brings me that first cup
of cappuccino, I am toast. Forget about it.

306
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,958
It's decaf. My nutritionist
is cutting down my caffeine.

307
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,514
Whoa!

308
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,756
Turned a little early there.

309
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,710
I was wondering. In order to capture
the essence of the police experience...

310
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,434
...do I get a gun?

311
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,755
For realism.

312
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,632
I mean, Lieutenant...

313
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,196
...it's not like
I'm gonna use the thing.

314
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,393
Although bullets would be nice.

315
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,433
Not if you tied my tongue
to your tailpipe and drove me...

316
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,358
...naked across a field of
broken glass. No, no, no!

317
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,119
- Is this about the actor?
- I gave the maggot a chance.

318
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,435
I got to the bathroom and back.

319
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,030
He doesn't belong here.
He belongs in never-never land...

320
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,276
...with his assistants, his maid...

321
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,518
...and the guy who wipes his ass
after he pinches off his loaf, OK?

322
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,712
<i>- This is about the actor.
- He wants to carry a loaded weapon.</i>

323
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,518
- Send that little jizzball in here.
- Thank you.

324
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,870
Excuse me, gents.
Sorry to interrupt.

325
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,275
- Hi, Captain Brix?
- Yeah.

326
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,039
Nick Lang. I understand
you're in on our secret.

327
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,276
Dave Dinkins sends his best, by the way.

328
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,235
Listen, I just wanted to thank you
for all your help in making this possible.

329
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,316
I gotta tell you.

330
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,236
My wife's crazy about you.

331
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,517
We are really big fans!

332
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,915
- Well, uh, what's your wife's name?
- Norma.

333
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,033
If it wasn't for people like you and Norma,
I'd be digging ditches. So, thanks.

334
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,273
Hey. Wow. I just got a great idea.
You and Norma...

335
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,197
- Do you have kids?
- Uh, no...

336
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,995
You and Norma come out to the coast,
see the premiere of the movie.

337
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,350
You can stay at my house with me.

338
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,040
- At your house?
- Do you like the beach?

339
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,315
What we talked about, the jizzball thing?

340
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,749
Yeah. Look, um...

341
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,271
- Would you sign this? To Norma?
- Not a problem. Absolutely.

342
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,554
<i>(both) Norma.</i>

Bang, bang...

...Nick Lang.

346
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,235
Thank you. Thank you.

347
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,233
- If there's anything we can do...
- You're doing it.

348
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,993
Thanks. OK.

349
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,076
Thanks, John.

"Bang, bang"?

351
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,589
Get my wife on the phone, would you?

352
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,072
Lieutenant, I was thinking.
I don't really need the gun.

353
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,880
It's probably better
to wait a couple of days...

354
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,629
...until I get this cop thing down pat.
- What have you got?

355
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,558
Coroner's report on that guy
the Party Crasher took out.

356
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,796
Of course, I'm off the case.

357
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,593
Safety bullets, hollow points.
That figures.

358
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,790
Custom-made. Look at this thing!

359
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,957
Looks like that Darth Vader thing
we took off the Dead Romeos.

360
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,117
Yeah. Are they buying from
the same guy the Party Crasher is?

361
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,708
- Check this.
- Might have to ask the Dead Romeos.

362
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,752
- Not me, of course. I'm off the case.
- Sorry to hear it.

363
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,471
I'll be introducing my new partner, Ray
Casanov, to the pleasures of a frog dog.

364
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,398
Frog dog, Ray! Mmm, tasty!

365
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,872
- Frog dog?
- Ribbet!

366

<i>(Moss) Look at this. I'm moving
to Florida, I swear to God.</i>

Get outta the way!

368
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,312
I guess cops can drive
as fast as they want, huh?

369
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,875
Look, Moss, let's get
on the same page here, OK?

370
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,993
I'm sensing that you're not
completely happy with this situation.

371
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,078
That's fine, OK? Cos I'm here
for one reason only.

372
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,754
You are the best. You're a heavyweight.

373
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,269
You're a Yoda among cops.

374
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,113
You know Yoda?
Little guy, big ears, real smart.

375
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,119
So it doesn't matter what you think of me,
cos I have respect for you.

376
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,276
And that is where I'm coming from.

377
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,837
Look, dickwad, I don't give
a rat's ass where you're coming from.

378
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,032
- I just care about where you're going.
- Good, we're talking.

379
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,754
Where do I drop you off?
Where are you staying?

380
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,075
- Give me a name.
- I'm staying with you.

381
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,714
Maybe when my asshole
learns to chew gum.

382
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,879
- I thought this was arranged.
- Nobody arranged jackshit with me.

383
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,198
You know, a lot of people would be
excited to have Nick Lang in their home.

384
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,072
I'll drop you off at their place.

385
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,553
- Listen.
- No!

386
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,670
You listen, you egomaniacal cockroach!

387

I got yanked off a case so
you could be a cop groupie...

...and now you wanna live in my house?

389
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,958
I got a job to do. I don't have time for
anybody in my house, this car, my life...

or b) the Party Crasher. Got it?

So that's what this is about.
You're still after this guy.

Give me the name of a hotel or I bounce
your ass out at the next light.

I dunno. Do you think
that's a good idea?

394
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,759
I don't think Captain Brix
is gonna like it.

I mean, us being separated,
you being back on the case.

Although I'm not
gonna mention anything...

No, no, it's not a tour.
Ange, I'm with Moss.

453

I'm already in the middle of a murder
investigation. Can you believe that?

454
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,990
I'm gonna get this part. I'm soaking
this up. You gotta see this place.

455

It's, like, the grit, the dirt, the crime,
the human drama - it's all around you.

456
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,470
You can feel it in the air.
Hey! Hey! I need that phone!

457
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,469
I'm calling a cop. You know
there's a cop right inside there.

Come on.

Shit.

- I said the dude's name is Witherspoon.

467
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,835
- Where?
- He moves around. Works out of a van.

John, I've been looking
all over for you.

470
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,916
They stole my cellular phone
and I think it mighta been a gang.

471
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,237
- Hi, guys. Sorry to interrupt.
- I told you to wait in the car.

- Only shorter, right?

that they're real pissed off and...

I think I lost a contact out there.

483
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,590
You told them I was in there? You led
'em to a rival gang, and to me?

484
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,508
- I was trying to help.
- Don't help me. I had to call this in.

10-4.

486
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,474
Over a dozen cops are coming
and I gotta explain...

00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,114
...what you were doing
in a gang war, jackoff!

488
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,435
Was that great?
I knew they were a gang.

489
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,393
They had that kind of gang look.
I got a knack for this.

490
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,149
You think you got a knack?
What was the licence plate of the car?

491
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,909
That was, uh... a New York plate.

492
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,996
They're blue, right?

493
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,110
You notice something a little
different about our car?

494
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,188
- They stole my bags!
- You shoulda locked 'em in the trunk.

495
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,278
You know, all my clothes were
in those bags. All my stuff!

496
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,356
At least they didn't steal your rubber gun.

497
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,790
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

498
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,354
Look at this. Look at this.

499
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,870
This could be a clue.
I think they're in this bar.

500
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,156
- So?
- So you gotta go in there.

501
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,714
- You gotta get my stuff.
- "Gotta"?

502
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,357
"Gotta"? Listen, Nick.
May I call you Nick?

503
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,596
I'd be happy to help
you with your problem...

504
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,915
...but, first, you gotta fill out a form.

505

Then I gotta get assigned to the case.
Then you gotta wait a few days, or weeks.

506
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,550
Fine. If that's the way
you wanna be about it, that's great.

507
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,989
Don't worry about it.
I'll go in there.

I don't want you inside my skin!

We live this job. It's something
we are, not something we do.

or be killed himself.

580
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,788
That's not something you step into
by strapping on a rubber gun.

You go back to your million-dollar house,

You get 17 takes to get it right.

583
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,678
We get one take.
It lasts our whole lives.

584
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,597
We mess it up and we're dead.

586
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:48,519
Look, John. Can you just do
that one more time for me? Please?

Lieutenant Moss. So, what's your
assessment of this Party Crasher?

608
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,553
You don't need a shrink to tell
you he's a raving psycho.

Come to think of it,
he may not even be a man.

00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,230
Is that the one from payroll with the jugs?

752
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,994
I get a world-class woody
every time I go down there.

753
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,670
Hey, guys. We got some ladies here.

754
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,032
- Bet that's a first!
- John, it's OK. Forget about it.

755
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,551
- It's not OK. Your daughter's here.
- Don't worry. I know what a woody is.

756
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,552
- How do you know what a woody is?
- Why don't we move to another table?

757
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,229
- Hey, guys, keep it down.
- Man, keep this down!

758
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,828
Jay! You faggot! You homo...

759

This is ridiculous.
Come here! Hey, leave him alone.

767

- I said, sit down!

768

It's all right, folks. I'm a police officer.

769
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,836
Ray, show 'em your badge.

770
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,396
Oh. NYPD. NYPD.

771
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,594
And call Midtown.
Tell 'em it's a 10-85.

772
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,870
Can we go now?
I think Bonnie's seen enough.

773
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,118
John, get the check.

774
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,800
Hey, get down there!
Put your hands on the table.

775
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,071
- I gotta go to the precinct.
- Can't Ray do that?

776
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,992
Put your hands on the table.

777
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,795
- No, he can't.
- All right, maybe he can escort us home.

778
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,792
- Hey! Susan!
- It was great!

779
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,592
Susan.

780
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,114
- Hey, they got home OK.
- Oh, it's you.

781
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,674
Sorry about Sal's.
I was gonna meet 'em and leave.

782
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,597
I had no idea they'd ask me to stay.

783
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,871
She's nice, Susan. So's Bonnie.
Decided to take her along, huh?

784
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,070
- She hates me.
- Buy her a pony.

785
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,670
- I'm talking about Susan.
- So buy her a horse.

786
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,358
Hey, can I get a beer?

787
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,870
Susan doesn't hate you.
She's just gettin' to know you.

788
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,875
You gotta... Can I offer
you a little advice?

789
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,355
No, you can't. No. No. No.

790
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,518
Loosen up a little bit, OK?
Seriously. Just... let her in.

791
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,108
- Bare your soul a little.
- Hollywood horseshit.

792
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,196
Where'd you get that last one from?

793
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,356
I can help you, John. I'm serious.

794
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,913
I got it. Pretend I'm Susan.

795
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,430
- What?
- Go with me. This is what I do.

796
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,596
I pretend I'm other people.

797
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,429
If you loosen up a little bit,
you might learn something.

798
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,596
Now, I'm Susan. You're John.

799
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,280
No, you're sick and I'm thirsty.

800
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,278
OK, maybe I can get us started here.

801
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,159
Well?

802
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,074
Well, what?

803
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,193
Talk to me, John.
Tell me what I wanna hear.

804
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,276
Get away from me. Who is this guy?

805
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,154
See? You never talk to me.
You always keep me at a distance.

806
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,840
You treat me like a princess
that you can't touch.

807
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,916
Well, maybe I wanna be touched, John.

808
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,713
- Hey, hey.
- Maybe I wanna be manhandled.

809
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,229
This is crazy.
Don't do this to me here, OK?

810
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,399
- Other men can talk to me.
- What other men? What other men?

811
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,318
- Can I get a Dubonnet, please?
- Is she seeing other men?

812
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,113
- See how he wants to talk?
- Listen, Lang.

813
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,559
- Lang!
- Susan.

814
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,750
- Whoever.
- Susan.

- Yes, John?
- Is she...

823
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,280
Are you seeing other men?

824
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,356
No, John. It's only you.

825
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,632
That's why it's so hard.
I want you, John.

826

But you just won't let me in.

827

- Thank you.
- Just a little...

828
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,358
- Ridiculous.
- I thought you were quitting for me.

829
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,119
- This is too strange.
- I'll tell you what's strange.

830
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,313
That somebody so strong
isn't confident in who he is.

831
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,671
- That's bullshit!
- Don't take that tone with me.

832
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,712
- Look... honey.
- Honey's good.

833
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:54,789
Ever since my divorce, yes, every time
I get serious about a woman, I get scared.

834
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,435
- How many women have there been?
- None, except for my wife.

835
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,790
- And me.
- And you. I mean, not you...

836
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,673
So how do you know you
get scared every time?

837
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,188
This is just like a woman. You turn it
around, give it a twist, you stick it in.

It's a joke.

money, Mr Witherspoon. I got...

Hey! Mr Witherspoon, look.
No, no. It's just...

He's told me, face-to-face,
that he wants to be me.

Can you believe people get paid for that?

903
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,111
<i>- (yells)
- Don't even think about it!</i>

904
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,232
You made a gun like this
with a laser sight, for someone else.

905
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,158
Tall guy, muscular build.
You're gonna help me find him.

906
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,637
- What did he do?
- He's been blowing holes in people.

907
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,551
- The Party Crasher?
- Where is he now?

908
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,195
I didn't know. He meets me.

909
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,151
Gives me some design specs.

910
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,394
I do 'em. I figure he was a gun fanatic.

911
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:29,998
He's waiting for a gun
I got now in the shop.

912
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,312
Well, you're gonna meet him
tomorrow. You got it?

913
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,793
O... O... OK.

914
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,352
I'm sorry I'm late.
It's just been one of those mornings.

915
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,836
- Couldn't get out of bed?
- No. I mean, no.

916
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,351
No, I just... just busy down at
the precinct. You know, this and that.

917
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,353
- Did you order?
- Yeah. I didn't know if you were coming.

918
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,473
It's all right.
I'll just find something real quick here.

919
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,556
All right. OK. Excuse me. Oh!

920
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,511
I, uh... took this perp in this morning...

921
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:14,193
...and I lost the key down a drain
after I un-cuffed him.

922
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:19,112
OK. Can I have the number six, with
romaine instead of iceberg lettuce...

923
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,073
...sprouts if they're fresh,
and a mustard vinaigrette?

924
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,919
No. You can have
what's on the menu, though.

925
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,191
- Can I have an Evian with lemon?
- I got tap water with ice.

926
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,429
Fine.

927
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,595
<i>(Susan chuckles)</i>

928
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,430
The reason I asked you
here is... well, is John.

929
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,670
- You guys are pretty close, right?
- Oh, yeah. Course.

930
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,075
You might say John's been
a role model for me.

931
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,516
On our first date, I thought
"Wow, who is this guy?"

932
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,238
He was so attentive, he was so giving
and he was such a good listener...

933
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,319
...but by the 2nd and 3rd date, I thought
"I wish this guy would loosen up...

934
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,317
...maybe talk about himself. "

935
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,356
Maybe he's just not interested.

936
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,471
- Oh, he is.
- Yeah?

937
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,160
Susan, believe me.

938
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,829
See, I just met you. How come I
feel closer to you than I do to him?

939
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,678
Well, that's...

940
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,031
- We haven't even slept together yet.
- Well, no, I...

941
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,518
<i>I want to. (chuckles)</i>

942
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,709
I used to have this speech
impediment. I couldn't say no.

943
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,070
Bonnie cured me of that.
She cured me of a lot of things.

944
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,796
Never thought I'd date a cop.

945
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,916
What's it like?

946
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,833
It's kinda hard to put into words.

947
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,475
I mean, we live this job.

948
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,637
It's something we are,
not something we do.

949
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,355
You can't become a cop by strappin'
on a gun and ridin' around all day.

950
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,392
When a cop walks up to
give someone a speeding ticket...

951
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,956
...he knows he might have
to kill someone, or be killed himself.

952
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:09,198
People think this job is like in the movies,
where you get 17 takes to get it right.

953
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,790
We get one take... and
it lasts our whole lives.

954
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,195
We mess it up...

955
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,197
...and we're dead!

956
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,071
Wow.

957
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,313
I wish John would express himself
like that. You know, like... mm!

958
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,355
I'm sorry. I just get...

959
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,755
It's nice having a police escort home.

960
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,674
- You like kids?
- Yeah, yeah.

961
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,873
Kids are great. They're like little people.

962
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,597
You were a big hit
with Bonnie last night.

963
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,676
Well, Bonnie's great.

964
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,116
Susan, listen.

965
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:04,996
This isn't right. OK? I know where
this is going and it's all wrong.

966
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,839
- What's all wrong?
- It happens to me all the time.

967
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,919
But it's best if we drop it now,
put it behind us, and nobody'll get hurt.

968
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,076
- Ray, I don't...
- I don't know what it is.

969
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,795
Maybe it's cos I look like Nick Lang.
Women go for that boyish type...

970
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,435
...but it's not fair to John.
- Ray, wait a minute. Did you think...

971
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,630
I mean, this isn't about you...

972
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,399
<i>I mean, you don't think
I'm attracted to you?</i>

973
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,674
You know.

974
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,997
No, no. Come on.
You attracted to me?

975
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:36,832
- No. Why would you be attracted to me?
- I'm sorry.

976
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,394
Of course, maybe if you got
to know me better.

977
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:50,028
- What we got here?
- Leave her alone!

978
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,190
Don't worry. Shh. He's a cop.

979
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,435
Ray?

980
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,358
- It's not my jurisdiction.
- You gotta do something.

981
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,711
Transit cops get bent out of shape
if you butt in on their busts.

982
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,638
This is useless junk, Grandma!
What else you got?

983
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,957
- Move over, doll.
- Stop it!

984
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,796
- Ray!
- Leave her alone!

985
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,636
- Give me my purse!
- Where's the cash? Check the money.

986
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,758
- Ray, you gotta stop them!
- All right. OK.

987
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,670
All right, hold it right there. NYPD.

988

- I'm fine.
- Can I talk to my partner?

1035
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:01,713
What the hell's going on? Coincidence?
You wanted to see a New York subway...

1036
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,149
...and you happened to be
on the one Susan was on!

1037
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,316
- I invited him to lunch.
- You what?

1038
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,829
- I can explain.
- You don't have to.

1039
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,794
First you bust up our date. Then
you're having lunch with my girlfriend!

1040
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:15,036
Oh, cut the jealousy bit.
You got no right.

1041
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,237
Take a few pointers from Ray.
He knows how to deal with people.

1042
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,709
And from what I saw,
he's probably a better cop.

1043
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:24,992
While you were probably trashing pizza
parlours, he was dealing with real felons...

1044
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,997
...without losing his head.

1045
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,314
Goodbye. Call me.

01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:32,035
I can't believe you just...
You just kissed him? You kissed his face?

1047
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,714
And where are my handcuffs?
I have to pay for those!

1048
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:40,039
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Why would you handcuff me to the bed?

1049
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,869
I was good in there, John. Seriously.
We were major cojones!

1050
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,237
So what is this? What? What?!

1051
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,188
I know. OK. I left him on his own.
Guilty as charged, sir.

1052
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,279
But... the guy's OK, right?
Not that that's any excuse.

You won't like that this happened while
I was working on the Party Crasher case.

1054
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,349
But before you say what you have
every right to say, listen to this.

1055
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,313
I know where the Party Crasher's
gonna be tomorrow.

1056
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:13,116
If we get every available car, call the
shots ourselves, we can drop him cold!

1057
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,916
- How?
- He's gonna pick up a gun tomorrow.

1058
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,713
We get there first. OK?

- No, Moss, you stay with Lang...

1062
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,559
...and you do what I told you
and stay off this case.
