00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,925
- You saved the receipt though, right?
- Mom.

165
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,051
If you think you're ready
for a bra like that

166
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,132
then we'll talk
about it, okay?

167
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,719
(Brit) Serena kinda made
fun of her sports bra.

168
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,772
- Why?
- 'Cause it totally, like, flattens out my boobs.

169
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,100
She said that guys would
think that I was hotter

170
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,151
if I, like,
had a better bra.

171
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,195
Does, like, Serena say
like all the time too?

172
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,864
Because, like,
you never used to.

173
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,113
Sorry.

174
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:18,663
You don't have to dumb yourself
down for guys, like Serena.

175
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,456
You know that.

176
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,000
Maybe she thinks that's
all she's got to offer.

177
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,711
(Brit) Her parents own half of
downtown Chicago. [horn honking]

178
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,130
You get my point
though, right?

179
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,752
Yes, Lynn.
[horn honking]

180
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:32,426
It's a parking lot,
moron. Go around!

181
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,049
Did you get my point?

182
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,596
Yeah, Mom. I get it.
[horn honking]

183
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,924
Oh, for the love of--

184
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,555
- Bite me!
- Mom!

185
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,350
Yeah, I'm gonna get the steak sandwich,
medium, with grilled onions.

186
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,600
And can I get a side
of chips, please?

187
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,148
Oh, I'm sorry, we don't--

188
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,066
(Al)
He means French fries.

189
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,690
Twenty years here, he still
can't say French fries.

190
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,773
I'm gonna have the same thing,
actually, except rare on the steak.

191
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,823
And to drink,
we'll have a bottle of--

192
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,025
Really?

193
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,032
'92 Rothschild.

194
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,829
Fantastic selection.

195
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,827
(Will) So what are
we celebrating?

196
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,871
(Al) So A & A wants to use us.
For everything.

197
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,123
- They liked the campaign?
- Liked?

198
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,125
How 'bout I just got a
phone call from the CEO

199
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:12,459
that was basically
ten minutes of phone sex.

200
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,340
Hey, let me
ask you something.

201
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,762
How old are you?

202
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,009
- Old enough.
- Oh.

203
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,806
I'm Claire, by the way.

204
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,007
Hi, Claire. I'm AI.

205
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,810
- That's Will.
- Hi.

206
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,762
Please let me know if there's
anything else you need.

207
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:25,893
Anything?

208
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,442
Can you stop?
She's nineteen.

209
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,939
One hour.
That's all I ask.

210
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,521
Just one hour
with that ass.

211
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,525
(Will)
How's Barbara?

212
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,696
Oh, fuck off.

213
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,944
[chuckles]

214
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,324
[cheerful pop music]

215
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,285
[singing]

216
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,541
That is so weird.

217
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,965
Peter and I were just doing exactly
the same thing in his room.

218
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,714
(Annie) Ah, Dad. [all laugh]

219
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,933
Okay. What now?

220
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,744
What? How old
are you?

221
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,082
[Annie, whispering]
Why do you keep lying?

222
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,210
[phone rings]
What?

223
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,878
Why do you keep
lying to me?

224
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,004
(Peter) Man, you won't believe
the stuff I'm Finding in here.

225
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,841
(Will) I'll say.
You wanna keep these Playboys?

226
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,221
What?

227
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,643
Just kidding.

228
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,846
Oh. Yeah, me too. [chuckling]

229
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,307
What, you packed
'em already?

230
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,188
Yeah, kinda.

231
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,483
[chuckles]

232
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,861
You all right with this?

233
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,238
With What?

234
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,365
The whole college thing.

235
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,536
Yeah, I guess.

236
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,114
Don't feel pressured

237
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,700
into doing things
you don't want to do.

238
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:12,663
Wait. This isn't another
father-son talk, is it?

239
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,874
Oh, Dad, we had the sex talk,
like, three years ago

240
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,301
and I still can't order a salad
with cucumbers in it.

241
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,845
I just don't want you to lose
sight of what's important, like--

242
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,764
Taking responsibility
for my actions

243
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,094
living up to my potential
and personal expectations

244
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,726
staying true to my beliefs.
Basically, being a man?

245
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,728
Something like that.

246
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:36,232
Relax, Pop.
I got this. Trust me.

247
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,110
God. Come on.
Let's hug it out.

248
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,941
[chuckles]

249
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,007
I feel the same way.

250
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,128
You coming in, sweetheart?
It's getting cold.

251
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,588
Hold on a sec.

252
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,298
Um, I'm talking
to Brittany, Dad.

253
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,428
Two minutes.

254
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,975
Okay. Now go away.

255
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,105
Hi.

256
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,276
How do I know that?

257
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,826
Okay.

258
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:29,577
Well, are you
still a virgin?

259
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:36,288
Good, 'cause that would
have been creepy.

260
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,169
So, um, how old
were you when you--?

261
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,503
Did you set the alarm?

262
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,430
Force Held activated.

263
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,133
Is Annie upstairs?

264
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,560
She's in her room.
Peter's still out.

265
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,727
Amen to that.

266
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,099
You heartless witch.

00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,647
What?

00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,724
You're happy he's
going, aren't you?

269
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:00,778
Two words for you.
Home gym.

[both chuckle]

271
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,531
His room's gonna look great
with a treadmill in it.

272
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,700
Our poor kid is barely packed and
you're already redecorating.

273
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:18,334
What can I say?
Except--good riddance! [chuckles]

(Annie)
They're in their room.

277
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:49,282
Right now?
Just a T-shirt and some underwear.

278
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,249
No. With just the T-shirt.

279
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,879
Okay.

280
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,636
Okay, it's dark now.

281
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,812
[chuckles softly]
Oh, I guess. What is it?

282
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,061
No.

Okay.

Is that everything?

286
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,462
Yeah.

287

Katie, come
give me a hug.

288

(Kate) No.
I don't want you to go.

[Peter clears throat]

So, I guess I'm gonna
go to college now.

291
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,561
I love you.
Email me, okay?

Where are you? I'm sitting
on the bench just outside.

it's really you.

Look at you.
You're gorgeous.

What?

No, it's me, Charlie.

Just give me
a chance to explain.

Okay, all right.
You're right.

I just couldn't think
of a way to tell you.

Don't get upset.
You're killing me here.

Annie? It's
still me. Okay?

Forget the age thing.
All that stuff that we talked about?

here next to you.

325
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:16,409
Why do you keep
lying to me?

326
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,242
Because of this.

327
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,825
I was,
I was afraid

328
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:28,755
that you wouldn't be mature
enough to understand.

329
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:34,711
Annie, when you connect with
someone the way that we connected

330
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:40,392
when you find a soul mate the
way that we found each other

331
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,640
then nothing else matters.

332
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,973
I thought you were old
enough to understand that.

333
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,481
I mean, you made me think you
could handle this, Annie.

334
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,569
I mean, this
is ridiculous.

335
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,868
I mean,
it's me, Charlie.

336
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,573
The same guy that you've been talking
to every day and every night

337
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,499
for the last
two months.

338
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,120
I love you.

339
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,882
Annie.

340
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:18,304
And I don't get why age
has to change that.

341
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,392
Can we just
walk a bit? Huh?

342
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,764
Talk a little bit more.

343
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,562
Just for a couple
of minutes

344
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:32,315
before I have my long drive
back to the airport?

345
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:35,067
Come on. Just--

346
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:39,901
I was just looking forward
to seeing you so much.

347
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:43,409
I thought we were
friends at least, Annie.

348
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,011
This remind you
of anything?

349
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:04,308
I was just thinking that.
Your year abroad in London.

350
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,808
All these American students come in.
I saw this girl.

351
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,265
Love at first sight.

352
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,271
Didn't work out.
I ended up with you.

353
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,479
There.

354
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,199
Sorry.

355
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,000
(Lynn)
Go ahead, spin it.

356
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:39,010
(Annie) The candy's weird.
It's better without it.

357
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,381
(Charlie)
Can I have some of yours?

358
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,475
Oh.

359
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:55,902
Yeah. You win.
Pistachio rocks.

360
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,900
So Peter
took off, huh?

361
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,356
You must be
so excited.

362
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,988
Yeah, I'm happy
for him.

363
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:04,910
I'm just gonna miss
him, that's all.

364
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,783
I just hope he doesn't
get caught up

365
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,956
into that whole
fraternity rush thing.

366
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,954
Sounds so stupid.

367
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,582
Yeah, there's definitely some
stupid stuff involved, but

368
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,413
I have to say
I was a Delt

369
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:18,090
and there were some great
things about it, too.

370
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:22,170
I met some, some quality guys that
I hope will be friends for life.

371
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:26,052
Yeah, I just, when he drinks
he kind of loses control.

372
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:30,762
This one time he tried to text
me the sound of him vomiting.

373
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,439
It's kind of tough to spell.
[chuckles]

374
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,143
it's kind of--
I, I don't know.

375
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:41,151
It's like, "UG,"
I don't know. But...

376
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,952
I just hope he doesn't just
do it to party and get laid.

377
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,996
But, yeah, I guess that's
what college is for, right?

378
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:52,792
Finding out for yourself,
finding out who you are.

379
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,037
What?

380
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,964
Nothing.

381
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,632
It's just

382
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,712
you amaze me.
Seriously.

383
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:07,799
You're so intelligent
and sensitive, like

384
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,975
wise beyond your years.

385
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,805
It's just amazing,
that's all.

386
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,225
Hey.

387
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,687
Want me to teach you the
secret Delt handshake?

388
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,273
Okay.

389
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,699
You can't
tell anyone.

390
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,900
I won't.

391
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,110
Okay.

392
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,695
Stick out your hand

393
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,371
like you're
gonna shake mine.

394
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,588
So--

395
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:46,671
So.

396
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,599
You still mad at me?

397
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,768
No, not really.

398
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,024
Wanna check out
your present?

399
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,851
Oh, yeah.

400
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:09,364
You said you'd want
one in red, so--

401
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,073
It's sexy, right?

402
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:18,377
I can't tell you how many times
I've thought about you in it.

403
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:25,877
It's crazy, I'm so
nervous and excited

404
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:30,385
to be sitting here with you
finally after all this time.

405
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,314
[soft piano music]

406

[soft piano

407
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,989
There.

408
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,323
Happy?

409
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,630
You look
ridiculously sexy.

410
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:47,584
No, don't go.

411
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,293
I'm serious.

412
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,592
Come here.

413
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,842
Come sit down.

414
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,816
(Charlie) Have you thought
about us like this?

415
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,660
I know you have because you
told me about it, didn't you?

416
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,538
(Annie) You don't think
my body's weird?

417
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,090
Are you kidding?

418
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:32,261
You're,
you're gorgeous.

419
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:40,766
So you're not--
disappointed or anything?

420
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,565
Annie. Annie.

421
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,062
You're perfect.

422
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,110
You take
my breath away.

423
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,040
Can I just--?

424
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,557
No, wait, Charlie, wait.
Hold on.

425
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,813
It's okay.

426
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:29,859
Charlie--

427
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,313
It's okay.

428
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,989
Charlie, wait.

429
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,953
Charlie.

[breathing fast]

432

It's okay, Annie.
Don't worry.

[soft metallic

taking these off

435
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,033
Oh. Hold still, Annie.
I've gotta take these off too.

436
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,916
That's my girl.

437
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,966

Look at you.

This is perfect.

440
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,566
(Lynn) How about the boys in class?
[cutlery clinking]

441
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,866
(Kate)
They 're okay.

442
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,070
(Lynn)
Are they?

443
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:06,282
(Kate) Um, we're making
bowls in pottery class, but

444
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,834
mine looks like
an ashtray

445
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,537
which is kind of funny
because I don't smoke.

How's school?

Annie.

Hm?

451
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:24,179
School.
How is it?

(Serena)
I know.

456
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,865
You should
go out with him.

Did you get my text?

458

Mm-hm.

00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,866
Why didn't you
call me back?

460

(girls)
OW!

462
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,840
I told you before.
He's not my boyfriend.

463
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,755
(girl 2) You keep saying that.
Makes me think you like him.

464
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,586
If you're so obsessed
with him, why you fuck him?

465
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,797
- What's your problem?
- Yeah? He's cute!

Annie, what happened?

That was him
at the mall, wasn't it?

471
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:22,612
How old is he?

472
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:23,863
It doesn't matter.

00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,357
mind if I borrow Annie
Cameron for a second?

486
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,186
(Annie) Ms.
Worley, why are we going this way?

487
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:02,113
Oh, it's all right,
Annie. Come on in.

488
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:08,116
Why don't you
have a seat?

489
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,044
I know, yeah.

490
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,248
Holy shit!
Dude, dude.

491
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,806
[muffled knocking]

492
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:37,482
(Will) No, it's Antigua.
Anguilla is a totally different island.

493
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,434
Honestly, I was hoping
to get the crew

494
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,441
and the equipment
in the same place.

495
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,488
Yeah. Hang on.
Hang on just a second.

496
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,782
Hello. Speaking.

497
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,325
[suspense music]

498
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,994
Sorry, I,
I don't understand.

499
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,914
(Lynn)
Will. Will!

500
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,242
What happened?

501
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,415
They won't tell me anything.
I just, I just! got here, and I--

502
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,246
Excuse me. Annie Cameron.
We're the parents.

503
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,455
Let me find
the nurse.

504
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,665
Mr. and Mrs. Cameron?

505
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,591
I'm Officer Gomez.

506
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,544
Your daughter wants you to
know that she's okay, but

507
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:06,879
maybe you should
have a seat.

508
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,555
- What's going on?
- What?

509
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,756
We don't know exactly
what's happened.

510
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,261
What we do know so far

511
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:12,888
is that we think
she was assaulted

512
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,515
by her alleged
boyfriend three days ago.

513
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,891
She hasn't
got a boyfriend.

514
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,473
Well, apparently
on Saturday

515
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,479
she met up with a man
she calls Charlie

516
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,186
at a motel, where she
was sexually assaulted.

517
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,897
The man is at least
35 years old.

518
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,448
Jesus Christ.
Where is she?

519
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,525
She's in an exam room
with the nurse

520
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,702
collecting evidence for the rape kit.
She's okay.

521
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,824
One of the counselors from
the hospital is with her.

522
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,871
I have to see her.

523
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,665
Look, there is a private waiting
room just down the hall--

524
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,083
We have to see her
right now!

525
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,206
We want to see
her right now.

526
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:42,881
She's having an exam.
You'll see her in a minute.

527
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,107
(nurse)
I'm almost done.

528
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,809
I just need to get one more
picture of that abrasion.

529
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,444
(Will) This is fucking insane.

530
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,450
On, baby.

531
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,831
[sobbing]

532
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:28,423
It's okay. We're here.
We're here now.

533
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,549
Mr. and Mrs. Cameron,
I'm Gail Friedman.

534
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,801
I'm a counselor
with the hospital.

535
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,678
I'm glad
you're here.

536
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,885
- Annie here is an amazing young woman.
- Gail.

537
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,346
- Ah. This is Special Agent Doug Tate with the FBI.
- Hi.

538
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,102
FBI?

539
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,603
(Doug) Well, any time
a crime is committed

540
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,229
against a child
using the Internet

541
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,982
and the suspect
is a traveler

542
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,905
someone from out of
state, they call us in.

543
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,074
Look, Annie, I know
you've had a rough day.

544
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,572
But I need to ask you a couple of questions.
You feel up for it?

545
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,950
Do we have
to do this now?

546
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:58,077
Trust me, the sooner we start
this investigation, the better.

547
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,783
Gail, do we still have the clothes
she was wearing that night?

548
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,243
- Yes.
- Are they here?

549
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,203
No, they're
at her house.

550
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,288
Okay, I need to get those
from you as soon as possible.

551
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:06,498
Is that okay?

552
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,924
Yeah, I guess.

553
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,001
Mr. Cameron,
Mrs. Cameron

554
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,634
I would like to talk to Annie alone.
Could you please just--

555
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,305
Look, I've had
enough of this.

556
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,383
This is our daughter.
We wanna be with her.

557
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,594
(Gail) You've got to
understand that right now

558
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,595
Annie's a victim of a crime and you
and your wife are just witnesses.

559
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,773
That's why we interview
everybody separately

560
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,975
so as not to contaminate
anyone's testimony.

561
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,560
Now if you can just give
Annie and I a second alone

562
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,065
and then I'll come
back to your house

563
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,238
and we can all
sit down and talk.

564
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,485
Fair enough?

565
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,168
(Lynn) So how long
will this take?

566
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:46,463
Well, it depends if we get enough
genetic material to run a profile.

567
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,085
And if there is,
how long?

568
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,212
Right now, there's
a nationwide backlog.

569
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,760
In Illinois alone, we've
got 2,000 unopened kits

570
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,304
sitting in freezers
waiting to be processed.

571
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,801
Some people have been
waiting a year.

572
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,723
- What? - How is that possible?

573
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,551
We'll run this through
the FBI facilities.

574
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,011
So, two weeks,
a month on the outside.

575
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,516
A month?

576
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:06,441
Now can I see
the family computer?

577
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:07,312
(man)
Doug.

578
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,894
Yeah.

579
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,071
- Did you copy the hard drive?
- Yup.

580
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,649
- We'll take that with the evidence down to the lab.
- Okay.

581
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,234
Apart from Teen Chat

582
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,943
were there any
other networking sites

583
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,448
you used to communicate?

584
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:19,996
No, not really.

585
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,120
Did you guys ever
speak on the phone?

586
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,076
You spoke to him.

587
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,912
(Doug) Now, you said
his mother was sick.

588
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:27,962
Yeah. Cancer.

589
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,755
Yeah, okay.

590
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,424
Tell him you feel awful
about his mother

591
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,172
that you really
wanna talk to him

592
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,595
that you lost
an uncle to cancer.

593
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,762
I-I don't know.

594
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,682
You don't know what?

595
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,886
I just don't
wanna lie to him.

596
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,063
What are you talking about,
sweetheart? He lied to you.

597
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,482
(Lynn) What do you think
of writing to him

598
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:50,527
and just telling him
how you feel?

599
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,321
(Doug) Yeah, Annie.
Would that be good?

600
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,023
Yeah, I guess.

601
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,108
Okay, good.

602
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,785
(Doug) Okay, just keep
if simple- Be yourself

603
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,912
Maybe he didn't
even like me.

604
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,121
He didn't.

605
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,048
(Lynn)
Will!

606
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,467
(Will) it wasn't like
that, sweetheart.

607
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,544
The man tricked you.

608
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,347

- Charlie.

00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,769
(Doug) Okay, now, remember,
he's gonna test you

612
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,346
to see if you told anybody.
You haven't, okay?

613
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,227
Tell him that
you're concerned

614
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,104
and a little worried that
he hasn't called. Okay?

00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,773
Yeah, answer
him. Yeah.

All right?

Hi.

(Charlie) It's kinda late.
Where are your parents?

00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,528

to the movies.

Well, that's it.
He's gone.

644
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,223
Why did you
make me do that?

645
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,775
Annie!

646
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:58,105
(Doug) He probably got your
cell number off your website.

647
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,781
(Doug) Look, I'll
give you a call

648
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,484
when I get back
from the motel.

649
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:06,572
Tell me something.
Did she yell for help?

650
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,453
I mean, did she scream,
tell him to stop?

651
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,580
Just because she
didn't scream for help

652
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,286
does not mean
this wasn't rape.

653
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,371
Now that guy is 20 years
older than she is.

654
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:18,174
He groomed her for weeks just
to get her into the motel room

655
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,547
and she's armed with what?
The eighth-grade biology

656
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,300
and the expectation that the
world is a decent place.

657
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,380
I'm gonna fucking
kill this guy.

658
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,592
No, you won't. That's why I'm here.
Now, we will find him.

659
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,301
And what am I
supposed to do?

660
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,681
You go back inside,
you support your daughter

661
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,729
and you let us
do our job.

662
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,227
What, with just five of you
guys working the whole state?

663
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,309
There's gotta be something I can do.
I'm not just gonna stand around and wait--

664
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,939
Mr. Cameron, I promise you.

665
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,863
I put everything
I got into these cases.

666
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,362
You just gotta
give us a chance.

667
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,409
Now, my cell
is on the back.

668
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,911
You call me
if you need anything.

669
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,335
I'll drop you a line tomorrow
when I get back from the motel.

670
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,344
(Lynn) You want me to
sleep with you tonight?

671
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,555
No, I just want
my blanket.

672
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,610
[sobbing]

673
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,380
[Annie, sobbing]
No, please, stop.

674
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,386
(Annie)
Stop, please!

675
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:37,348
Dad, please help me
to stop him.

676
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,433
Please, Dad, help!

677
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:46,235
[screaming] Help me!
No, get off! [sobbing]

678
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:49,989
Don't Please, Dad, help me, please.
[sobbing and screaming]

679
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:54,865
Stop! No!

680
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:58,911
(Al)
Will.

681
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,916
You all
right, buddy?

682
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,963
Yeah, of course.

683
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,088
If Mrs. Van Dersey
wants the meeting, fine.

684
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:09,171
But I think that we should
dictate the parameters.

685
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,675
No more of this bullshit.

686
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,304
Good.

687
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,225
Is there
any more coffee?

688
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:18,646
Grab another coffee.

689
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:22,567
(Will) Hey.
I got you a new cell.

690
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,107
Now, you have
to promise me

691
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:27,564
that you're not
gonna try and call him

692
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,070
or text him
with this new number.

693
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,402
Remember what Tate
said about the old one

694
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,704
that if he tries to call you on
that, you tell us immediately.

695
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,577
I'm gonna have
to check the bills.

696
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:39,751
And if I find out that
you've tried to contact him

697
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,999
I'm gonna have
to take it back.

698
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:43,751
Okay?

699
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,557
So what? Do I just start
talking like Tony Soprano?

700
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:42,230
Boy, I hope not.
[chuckles softly]

701
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,730
I'm glad you came.

702
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,981
Yeah, well, my parents
said I had to.

703
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,688
Well, even so,
I'm still glad.

704
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,239
I want this
to be a place

705
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:53,908
for you to feel
safe and comfortable

706
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,360
talking about anything.

707
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,161
I just wanna
be helpful to you.

708
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,238
You think
I need help?

709
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:02,075
I think that what you've been
through must be very difficult.

710
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,581
You know, what's
the big deal?

711
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,287
There are girls
at my school

712
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,044
who've had sex
with half the football team.

713
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,466
I lose my virginity
and my parents

714
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,168
make a federal case
out of it.

715
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,594
Literally.

716
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,046
I think they're
more concerned

717
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,301
that you may have
been in danger

718
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,256
more than anything else.

719
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,842
Danger?

720
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:21,678
That's 'cause
they don't know him.

721
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,809
You know,
the thing is

722
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:27,563
I bet my dad would
really like him

723
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:31,067
if they'd met,
you know, before.

724
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,864
What is it about him you think
your father would like?

725
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:39,447
He's sweet, and smart,
and really funny.

726
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:42,532
And gives great advice and
which, by the way, worked.

727
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,709
I-I made the team
because of him.

728
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,582
You think that's the only
reason you made the team?

729
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:50,541
Because of his advice,
and not your own ability?

730
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:54,378
Well, he's older.
He's been playing longer.

731
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,508
What'd you think
about him being older?

732
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:01,218
At first I thought
he was 16, okay?

733
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:06,397
And then, all of a sudden
he's 20 and I'm like, what?

734
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,850
And then we kept talking

735
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:12,983
and I was, like,
what's the big deal?

736
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:15,736
He gets me, you know?

737
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:18,364
He's not judgmental.

738
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,821
He's encouraging.

739
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:26,375
And despite my age difference
he still loves me.

740
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,330
And he thinks
I'm beautiful.

741
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,166
What'd you think
about him

742
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:36,093
not being honest
about his age?

743
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:39,593
You know,
Charlie said that

744
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:43,302
when you connect
like we did

745
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:47,355
when you find
that soul mate

746
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:51,435
that's the only thing
to think about.

747
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,270
Don't you believe that when
two people are in love

748
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,197
nothing else matters?

749
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,992
I can understand how strong
those feelings are, Annie.

750
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:04,072
But, there are reasons why
girls your age and men his

751
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,828
aren't supposed
to be together.

752
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,204
Whatever.

753
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:12,881
He loves me.
I know he does.

754
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,959
And he's dying
to call me or email me

755
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:18,090
but he knows it's no! safe

756
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:22,299
thanks to my parents
and the FBI.

757
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,759
I just--

758
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:28,642
What?

759
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:31,065
I just hope he's okay.

760
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,269
[suspense music]

761
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,025
What, he go to lunch early?

762
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,323
He went home.
Said he wasn't feeling well.

763
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,410
Hello?

764
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:44,908
Will, it's Agent Tate.

765
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,705
I wanted to give
you an update.

766
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:49,455
Now, look, the motel
didn't give us much.

767
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,206
He paid cash
for the room.

768
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,379
He told the manager
he lost his wallet.

769
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:55,548
He even ordered a credit
card right in front of him.

770
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,508
The, uh, the cell phone was prepaid.
It was purchased in St. Louis.

771
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,803
He paid cash for that,
too, whoever he is.

772
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,255
So his name's not
Charles Hightower.

773
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:04,090
Yeah, not that
we can tell.

774
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:05,800
I found seven of them living
in the U.S. so far

775
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,056
but none of 'em
fit the description.

776
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,433
There 's nothing that even
confirms he's from California

777
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,477
we, uh, we actually traced his IP
address to the Czech Republic.

778
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,308
What?

779
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,815
It seems he's running some
sort of ghost program.

780
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,817
It's a software
that basically bounces

781
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,022
his IP address from
one server to another

782
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,028
all over the world.

783
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:22,324
Sir?

784
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,492
Sorry, I don't understand.

785
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,240
What does that mean?

786
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,413
It means he's good
at what he's doing.

787
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,911
But don't worry, don't worry.
This is exactly how it starts.

788
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,412
You need to go on through,
go get your stuff.

789
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:32,789
Yeah, one minute, please.

790
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,085
What about the car?
Anything?

791
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,084
Hang up the phone, sir.

792
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,756
It was an airport rental.
He must've swapped the plates.

793
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,675
Gary!

794
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,047
(Will) Look, I'm, I'll have
to call you back. Okay?

795
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:42,549
Seriously, is
my conversation

796
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,505
that much of a threat
to security?

797
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,760
Thank you, sir.

798
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,305
Is it over?

799
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:55,608
Yeah, you missed
a pretty good fight.

800
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:58,186
(Lynn) When they do Real
Housewives of Chicago

801
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,896
I am so auditioning.

802
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,198
Yeah, right.

803
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,236
I talked to Jennie.

804
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,868
Brittany's really upset
you won't call her back.

805
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,494
Good.

806
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:15,036
She was only
trying to help, honey.

807
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,371
Yeah, well, she's a bitch.

808
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,877
No, she's
your best friend.

809
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,334
Best friends don't
narc on each other.

810
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,385
Not like she'll ever
get a boyfriend

811
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,180
but if she does, I hope someone
ruins it for her, too.

812
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:27,632
(Will)
Lynn?

813
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,682
(Will)
Did you get my message?

814
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,353
Yeah, I called
you back

815
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:36,603
but it went to voice mail.
Did you eat?

816
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,275
Have a look
at this a second.

817
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,977
You won't believe this.

818
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,061
[typing]

819
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,772
What is this?

820
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:46,200
This is the National
Sex Offenders Registry.

821
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:50,200
There's perverts all over
Wilmette, not just Chicago.

822
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,333
See this? All
these red dots.

823
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,534
They're everywhere.

824
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:58,588
Oh, my God.

825
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,757
This guy here is literally
three blocks away on Linden.

826
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,425
What's going on?

827
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,471
Hi, sweetheart.
Um, come here a second.

828
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,424
I, I need you to do
something for me.

829
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,518
These men are all registered sex
offenders in the neighborhood

830
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:21,978
that fit the description.

831
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,654
I need you to look
through them.

832
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,072
Why?

833
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,649
In case one of them's Charlie.

834
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,951
What?

835
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,120
No. N-- No.

836
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:34,790
(Lynn) Honey, you should.
One of them could be him.

837
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,137
None of them's him.

838
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,594
Forget the hair and the mustaches.
Just look at the face.

839
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:56,099
Could any
of them be him?

840
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,146
I said, no.

841
00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,769
God, what's
your problem?

842
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,521
My problem is you
were attacked.

843
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,352
It wasn't like that.

844
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:06,564
Besides, none of them
are Charlie, okay?

845
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:09,150
Are we done?

846
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:23,335
(Lynn) Pervert Tracker.
What is this?

847
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:26,293
It's a group
I met with today.

848
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:31,093
(Will) Supposed to be the best in the country.
They hunt predators.

849
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,890
Today? It says
they're in New Jersey.

850
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,850
You were in New Jersey today?

851
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,352
You got on a plane today
without telling me?

852
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,732
Are you fucking
kidding me?

853
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,654
I swear to God, Will

854
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:50,153
if you ever get on a plane
again without telling me

855
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,280
I swear to God, I don't
know what I'd do.

856
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,861
I'm sorry.

857
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:57,574
Honey, you're right.
I'm sorry.

858
00:51:57,656 --> 00:52:00,159
I'm gonna go
check on her.

859
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:03,246
[suspense music]

860
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,960
(Annie) I've gotta
get out of my house.

861
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:49,883
How come? What's
happening at home?

862
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:53,883
You know, they think I'm stupid
for meeting up with him.

863
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,054
Going back to his hotel.

864
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,428
They said that?

865
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:01,308
My dad looks at me
like I'm an idiot.

866
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:04,857
He wants to kill Charlie.
That's all he talks about.

867
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:06,730
Getting his hands on him.

868
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,686
Well, what would you do if
he got in touch with you

869
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:11,113
have you thought about what
you would say to him?

870
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:14,988
I just wanna talk to him.
Hear his voice.

871
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,700
See how his mom's doing,
and his little dog.

872
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:25,662
See how we're gonna
make this work.

873
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,129
I just wanna talk to him
about what happened.

874
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,677
We haven 'I really
talked about that

875
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:38,474
about what happened
in the motel.

876
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:40,643
Are we supposed to?

877
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:44,268
In my experience,
it helps. It really does.

878
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,144
But only if you're ready.

879
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:59,321
Li 's kind of weird,
you know.

880
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:07,874
Like it wasn't really
happening to me.

881
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,552
Like I was watching it
from above.

882
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:25,055
Sometimes when you can't
physically escape from a situation

883
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:28,983
where you feel frightened
or threatened

884
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:35,064
you find a way to remove or
distance yourself psychologically.

885
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:38,651
It's a way
of protecting yourself.

886
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:41,283
Does that make sense?

887
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:45,791
Still have ten minutes.

888
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:48,210
Yeah, well.
I'll see you later.

889
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,754
(Al) Chicago has a very
strong sense of history.

890
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,127
Kinda like when they bought Marshall
Fields, turned it into a Macy's.

891
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:54,959
They lost half
their client base.

892
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,919
(Will) It's a fine line.
You want a fresh look

893
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,800
but you don't want to alienate
your loyal customers.

894
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,301
We loved what you
did with A & A

895
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,007
particularly
in the tween market.

896
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,592
Well, that was mostly
Will's work here.

897
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,177
Well, I don't know
if that's true

898
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,763
but I'm very happy
to take the credit.

899
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,653
(man)
Rebecca?

900
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:16,981
Becky.

901
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:17,815
Jerry?

902
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:18,774
Yeah.

903
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,234
Hi, Jerry.

904
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,911
Look at you.
You're gorgeous.

905
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,909
(Becky over mic)
You really think so?

906
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,709
(Jerry over mic)
Yeah. Can't believe it's you.

907
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:30,331
Did you bring
your stuff?

908
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:34,506
(Jerry)
Uh--

909
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,208
Fuck!

910
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,588
(Doug) Hey! Hey! Stop! FBI!

911
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:42,720
(Becky)
Hey, get that guy!

912
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:45,768
(Doug) Go, guys, get him, get him!
Come on!

913
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:46,639
Hey!

914
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,439
Actually, there's
a lot of similarities

915
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,562
between your company
and Academic Appeal.

916
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:55,315
It's just you have a much more
sophisticated client base.

917
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:58,113
Everybody wants to broaden
their consumer appeal

918
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,940
especially in the tween market.

919
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,993
I mean, it's like
the Holy Grail of--

920
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:07,494
Sorry, would you just
excuse me a minute?

921
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:10,122
(Doug) Look, I'm
really sorry, Will.

922
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,749
So what made you think
he was our guy?

923
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:15,456
The program he was running
to scatter his IP address

924
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,041
the chat rooms he used.

925
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,296
Mostly, Will, it was
his conversation.

926
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,218
It was the way he spoke.

927
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,046
It was very similar
to the way Charlie chatted.

928
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,177
How do you know that?

929
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:26,429
I was able to get transcripts
of two months worth of IM chats

930
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,977
between him and your
daughter from Teen Chat.

931
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,019
You're kidding.

932
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,722
No. I'm not.

933
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:32,852
So when can I see them?

934
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,308
You can't, Will.

935
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,189
It's an ongoing
investigation.

936
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:38,066
I'd completely lose
Annie's trust.

937
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:39,943
Now, I do have
some good news.

938
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,866
The lab was able to extract
enough DNA for a profile.

939
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,818
We're gonna run it through
CODIS, the national database

940
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,870
and if there's a hit
we should know

941
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:49,039
within a week or two
at the most.

942
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,663
Hey, I'll be right back.
I gotta call in.

943
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,047
(Will)
Lynn.

944
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,803
Will, what are you
doing here?

945
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:08,099
I just came
from seeing Tate.

946
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,518
What's wrong?

947
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,561
You're not gonna
believe this.

948
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:12,729
What? What
is this?

949
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,226
Read it.

950
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:15,307
What is it?

951
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:15,982
Just read it.

952
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:20,779
"l can't stop
thinking about it."

953
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,606
"You inside me.
I get wet when I picture it."

954
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:23,986
Okay, stop.

955
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,068
Our daughter
wrote this.

956
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,245
Annie.

957
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,287
"How big are you?
I bet you taste good."

958
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:30,615
Will, stop it.

959
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:31,823
"l wanna see it
right now."

960
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:33,750
Stop it,
Jesus God!

961
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,919
I mean, she's 14.
Where the hell did she learn this?

962
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,917
She's 14, she didn't
make this happen!

963
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,794
Yeah, but we're gonna have
to talk to her about this.

964
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,546
- You are not gonna talk to her.
- But look at it!

965
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,252
Our daughter sounds like
a fucking porn star!

966
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,588
You cannot confront
her about this.

967
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:47,014
- I'm gonna kill him.
- No.

968
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:48,716
I swear to God,
I'm gonna find

969
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,642
this animal and I'm
gonna fucking kill him!

970
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:52,845
Stop it!

971
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:55,852
Oh, my God.
You're acting crazy, Will.

972
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:59,435
No, you're not gonna--
You're not gonna read this.

973
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:01,486
Just leave it alone.
Give it to me.

974
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:04,110
I'll see you tonight.

975
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:06,984
(Doug) Now I need you to bring
that back to me right now, Will.

976
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:08,785
I'll get it back
to you tomorrow.

977
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,737
You do know it's
a federal crime, right?

978
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,289
(Will) I just think I
have a right to know

979
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:14,241
who my daughter's
talking to.

980
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,247
No, no, no. You are interfering
with the investigation.

981
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,498
You've betrayed your
daughter's trust to me.

982
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,204
She doesn't need to know.

983
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,085
You're not letting me
do my job, Mr. Cameron.

984
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,711
I need you to bring them
back to me right now, Will.

985
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,338
Yeah, I will.
I'll get it back to you.

986
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:25,761
Right--

Hey, stranger.

This is something, huh?

991
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:53,989
Oh, yeah, it's great. I feel 80.

Mojito?

993
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,660
I'm fine, thanks.

Hey, great party, man.

00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,968
Will. Are you
all right?

998
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:54,766
No, I'm, I'm, I'm
just feeling, I'm--

999
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,343

I heard the door.

(Will)
That was me.

1005
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,871
I, I couldn't sleep.
I took a drive.

1006
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:00,870
Well, you scared me.

1007
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:03,456
Will, you scared me.

1008
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:06,084
Sorry.

1009
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:10,174
All right, so,
are you coming up?

1010
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,968
In a bit.

1011
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,595
What are you doing?

1012
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,096
Nothing.

1013
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,784
Is this you?

1014
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,090
Are you, are you
Sad Little Girl?

1015
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:55,671
What are you doing?

1016
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:57,973
You're posing
as a teenage girl

1017
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:00,767
to chat with men
on line, seriously?

1018
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,389
That's what they do.
They showed me.

1019
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:03,846
Oh, my God.

1020
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:06,478
It's a way
of drawing them out.

1021
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:16,240
Good night.

1022
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:30,937
(Lynn) I spoke to Pete today.

1023
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:32,984
He's coming home
for Halloween.

1024
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:36,025
(Lynn) Well, he said he would try.
He's got a lot of work.

1025
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:38,607
But, and he sounds
good. Happy.

1026
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,113
You didn't tell
him, did you?

1027
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,239
(Lynn)
No. But I--

1028
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,445
Don't, okay?

1029
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,781
Oh, about what?
What?

1030
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,958
Remember what we talked
about upstairs, sweetie

1031
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,535
about Annie
being hurt?

1032
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:50,834
I'm serious, okay?

1033
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,457
Okay.

1034
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:59,094
How 'bout we go to the
movies this weekend?

1035
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:00,967
Is there anything
you wanna see?

1036
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,390
Nothing you'd
be interested in.

1037
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:06,560
Well, try me.
I may surprise you.

1038
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:07,726
Yeah, right.

1039
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:11,181
What does that mean?

1040
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:14,438
Why are you being so mean to me?
What did I do?

1041
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,643
I'm not being mean.

1042
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:17,149
Katie, am I being mean?

1043
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,697
(Kate)
No.

1044
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:22,026
How 'bout we go on a
bike ride this weekend?

1045
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:25,954
(Kale) Well, yeah.
Uh, can we also go along the lake?

1046
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:29,829
Yeah. And we can go to that
favorite rock that you like.

1047
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:31,501
Cool.

1048
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:37,666
(Annie)
Great.

1049
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:42,004
(Lynn) You know, you don
'I have to do this, honey.

1050
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:43,634
Yeah, I know.

1051
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:50,854
Well, call me if you
need anything, okay?

1052
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:55,851
Honey? Give me a kiss.

1053
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:01,565
I love you.

1054
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,446
See you later.

1055
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:04,617
Okay.

1056
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:11,951
You're gonna have
to talk to me sometime.

1057
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:14,377
I'm really sorry,
Annie, okay?

1058
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:17,171
I didn't know
what else to do.

1059
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:18,373
Annie?

1060
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:19,457
You're sorry?

1061
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:20,838
Yeah.

1062
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,636
Do you realize
what you did?

1063
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,679
You fucked up everything.

1064
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,883
Charlie, my parents, everything.

1065
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:29,183
I was scared, okay?

1066
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,102
No. It's not okay.

1067
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,145
I kept every
secret of yours.

1068
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:37,692
Annie, you're my best friend
and I was worried about you.

1069
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:42,568
"Was." I was
your best friend.

1070
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:45,400
Do me a favor and never
talk to me again.

1071
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:46,279

1072
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,578
Annie!

1073
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:50,914
(Al) That was fucking embarrassing
at the big launch party.

1074
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:52,787
Oh, yeah, I know,
I'm sorry.

1075
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:54,334
It was just some personal stuff.
It was nothing.

1076
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:56,252
You're sure?

1077
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:59,206
Because you've been kind
of MIA around here lately.

1078
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,667
There just could not be a
worse time to be distracted

1079
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:03,422
while I really need
your head in the game.

1080
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:05,469
What, you don't think
I'm giving a 100 %, Coach?

1081
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,799
Well, you tell me.
I put this on your desk a week ago.

1082
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:11,635
Mel's been waiting since Monday
for you to sign off on this.

1083
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,720
Well, tell him, then, fine.
Run with it.

1084
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,976
You haven't even looked
at it, have you?

1085
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:18,558
What the hell's
going on?

1086
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,866
It's Annie.

1087
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:34,203
She was sexually assaulted.

1088
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:35,704
What?

1089
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:38,791
Oh, my God.

1090
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,962
I had no idea, Will.

1091
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:48,422
She's fine.
I mean, she wasn't, but she's okay.

1092
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,303
They catch the guy?

1093
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,133
They're looking for him.

1094
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:54,595
They started with the
crime scene in the motel.

1095
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,145
Jesus. She
was kidnapped?

1096
01:06:56,221 --> 01:07:00,067
No, she-- She sort
of knew the guy.

1097
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,564
I-- I don't understand.

1098
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,271
It was someone
she met online

1099
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:06,982
someone she'd been
talking to for a while.

1100
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:12,071
Oh, I thought you meant she was
like attacked, you know. I--

1101
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,951
You scared the shit
out of me.

1102
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,499
She was raped.

1103
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,497
She's 14.
The guy's in his 30s.

1104
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:21,204
I know, I know.
It's just that I was picturing--

1105
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:24,040
Well, you don't wanna know
what I was picturing.

1106
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,592
Could have been
much worse.

1107

[Will, knocking]
Hey, can I come in?

1108
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:33,800
I guess. What's up?

1109
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:37,933
How was school?

1110
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:40,390
Okay.

1111
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:49,858
Was it weird seeing
your friends again?

1112
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:51,909
It was fine, Dad.

1113
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,373
Did you see Gail today?

1114
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:00,831
No, tomorrow.

1115
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,287
How, how's that going?

1116
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:05,374
Great. I'm cured.

1117
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:13,973
Still no contact
from "Charlie"?

1118
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:20,392
I hate when you do that.

1119
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:22,724
Say his name like that.

1120
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:23,933
It's not his
real name, is it?

1121
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:25,314
What do you want, Dad?

1122
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:26,565
Has there been
any contact?

1123
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:27,566
No.

1124
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,488
None at all?

1125
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:31,032
What, you don't
believe me?

1126
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,575
You wanna check
my phone?

1127
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,617
Would you have
a problem with that?

1128
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:35,036
Yeah, I would.

1129
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,408
Why, if there's
nothing to hide

1130
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:38,535
why would that
be a problem?

1131
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,208
You're unbelievable.

1132
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,411
What?

1133
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,621
Take it.
What's your problem?

1134
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:48,174
What is my problem?
My problem is you lied to me, sweetheart.

1135
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:51,344
From the second that you knew he
wasn't 15, you should have told me

1136
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:54,298
and you didn't.
You lied.

1137
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,883
Why didn't you come and
talk to me or your mother

1138
01:08:56,966 --> 01:09:00,812
and say what was going on?

1139
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,935
When you found out
for the first time, what--

1140
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:04,766
What were you thinking?

1141
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:07,602
You didn't know then that
something was wrong?

1142
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,734
When you, you met him in the mall
and saw him for the first time

1143
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:13,532
what do you do, you don't call me?
You don't run away?

1144
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:16,157
You get in a car with him?
it's like rule number one.

1145
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:18,329
You know, I'm trying
to understa--

1146
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:19,451
Please just leave me alone.

1147
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:20,998
But talk to me. I--

1148
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:22,075
You're just pissed
you didn't know.

1149
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,751
No, that's not--

1150
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,328
No, everything
would've been fine

1151
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,163
if everyone would've
just chilled out.

1152
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:28,463
- What are you talking about?
- Charlie and me.

1153
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:29,631
Are you out
of your mind?

1154
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:30,754
You're the crazy one!

1155
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,176
Checking my phone,

1156
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:33,628
bringing out sickos
on the web.

1157
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:34,758
I'm trying
to find the scumbag!

1158
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,009
He's not like that!

1159
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,887
You don't even know him!

1160
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:39,808
My God, you're protecting him.
The guy raped you.

1161
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:41,181
And you're protecting him.

1162
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,012
He didn't rape me!

1163
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:45,315
Get out, get out of my
fucking room right now!

1164
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,108
I hate you. Get out!

1165
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,026
Get out!

1166
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:54,399
Get out of my room!

1167
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:11,966
I just wanted to know
how Annie's doing.

1168
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,590
You know I can't discuss her
treatment with you, Mr. Cameron.

1169
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:16,342
I'm sorry, but this still
doesn't make sense to me.

1170
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:18,014
She's my daughter.
A minor.

1171
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:20,308
If she needed
an appendectomy

1172
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:22,226
you'd need my signature
for surgery, right?

1173
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,518
Therapy is different.

1174
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,141
Yeah, but this whole--

1175
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,518
None of this makes
sense to me.

1176
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:27,598
And I'm really
starting to--

1177
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:30,151
What's going on?

1178
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:39,737
I cannot stop
thinking about it.

1179
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:45,451
I'm driving my car

1180
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:49,208
whatever, in the office,
in a meeting

1181
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:53,463
and I think about him
on top of her.

1182
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,888
The other night I had this dream.
I'd got him.

1183
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:11,647
I was beating
the life out of him.

1184
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:13,569
I was on top of him
and I was punching him

1185
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:15,112
and punching him
and his face was caving in

1186
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:16,986
there was blood
going everywhere

1187
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:19,066
and I could actually
taste it.

1188
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,949
I woke up, I found I'd actually
chewed the inside of my mouth.

1189
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:24,531
It's my own blood
I was tasting.

1190
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:26,908
What if they did catch him and they put him in jail him.
How would that make you feel?

1191
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,870
Good. Relieved.

1192
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:32,459
Angry.

1193
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:33,835
Why angry?

1194
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:35,462
Because I'd still
want to rip

1195
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,884
his fucking head off
and now I couldn't.

1196
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,212
What else are you
angry about?

1197
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:43,926
I'm angry I didn't know
what was going on.

1198
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:48,434
I'm angry that Annie
lied to me.

1199
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:53,861
That I didn't know the extent
of her intimacy with him.

1200
01:11:57,939 --> 01:12:00,192
That I couldn't--

1201
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,032
What?

1202
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:05,954
Stop it?

1203
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:14,039
We can't control what happens
to us or our loved ones.

1204
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:16,965
What happens when Annie
goes to college?

1205
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:19,294
What are you saying?

1206
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:22,506
People get hurt.

1207
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:24,135
There's only
so much we can do

1208
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:25,512
to protect ourselves,
our children.

1209
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,013
The only thing
we can do

1210
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:28,720
is we can be there
for each other

1211
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:31,898
when we do fall down,
to pick each other up.

1212
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,514
[suspense music]

1213
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:37,539
[heavy breathing]

1214
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:39,215
[mud]

1215
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,917
Ugh!

1216
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:49,304
[gunshot]

1217
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:52,057
(man) Can I help you with
anything today, sir?

1218
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:47,775
(Peter)
Hey, Pop!

1219
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:53,281
(Will)
Hey.

1220
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,701
(Peter)
You look older.

1221
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:59,128
(Will) It's only been
six weeks, smart ass.

1222
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:00,796
(Peter) Yeah, still,
maybe it's, uh

1223
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:02,544
like Einstein's
special relativity.

1224
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:04,842
You know, six weeks to me,
five years to you.

1225
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:08,342
(Will) I think I preferred you
with a high school education.

1226
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:12,096
(Peter) Dude. No way.
I don't want you to hurt yourself.

1227
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,175
So how was
the ride in?

1228
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:14,602
Okay.

1229
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,099
Okay. I'm still
a little, ech.

1230
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,475
Oh. Big night, eh?

1231
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:19,557
I was off my face,
wasn't I?

1232
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,187
Come here.

1233
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:31,994
Jesus, Pop. What is it?

1234
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:37,534
(Aunt)
Where are the kids?

1235
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:41,120
(Lynn) Come on, kids.
Hurry up, the food 's gonna be cold.

1236
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:44,086
(Peter)
All right, ready?

1237
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:45,667
Hey!
[all laugh]

1238
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,627
[all clapping]

1239
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,964
it's fantastic.

1240
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:53,766
(Lynn) Look at the
toilet seat cover.

1241
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:56,720
It was her idea.

1242
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:59,305
Let me help you off with your
flippers so you can eat.

1243
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:00,810
(Kate)
No, Mom, that's cheating.

1244
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,016
That's not a very
scary mask, Pete.

1245
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:03,225
It is to Grandpa.

1246
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:04,310
Don't get
me started.

1247
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,986
He's a socialist.

1248
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,609
(Grandmother)
Oh, Cal, now come on.

1249
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:08,735
No costume, Annie?

1250
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,782
This is my costume.

1251
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:12,531
(Kate) You're not supposed
to wear a penguin

1252
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:14,032
you're supposed
to be a penguin.

1253
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,784
Do you want me
to come or not?

1254
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:17,410
Okay. I guess
you can come.

1255
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:19,788
[all chuckle]

1256
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:22,791
(Peter) I'm sorry I
didn't get to email much.

1257
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:24,338
You know, things
have been really crazy.

1258
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,415
It's no big deal.

1259
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:30,049
No. No, I should have called more.
Checked in a bit.

1260
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:34,007
You know I love you, right?
Right?

1261
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,933
(Grandmother) Did you
kids ever hear the story

1262
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:37,976
about when Grandpa and
I met on Halloween?

1263
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:39,770
He asked me to take
a picture of him

1264
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:42,815
next to this statue
of a werewolf

1265
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,563
They've all heard
the story, Susan.

1266
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:45,518
(Lynn)
No, no, we haven 't.

1267
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:46,568
Okay, good.

1268
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:48,112
So, he goes up

1269
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:49,734
and he stands
right under it

1270
01:16:49,814 --> 01:16:52,192
trying to impress me,
of course.

1271
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,652
But it turns out it's just a
guy in a costume, right, hon?

1272
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,829
[chuckling]
And he grabs Grandpa.

1273
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:59,282
And Grandpa starts
screamin ' like a girl.

1274
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:01,493
- (Grandfather) I did not.
- (Grandmother) You did.

1275
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:05,125
[all chuckle]

1276
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:07,627
Annie, honey.
Is that corn cold?

1277
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:08,798
Because I could heat it
up for you, sweetie.

1278
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:10,922
Mm. it's fine.

1279
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:14,096
Annie, you have to try the sweet potatoes.
They are amazing.

1280
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:18,927
Oh, they are, sweetheart, they are.
Just, just have a little. You'll love 'em.

1281
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:21,603
You guys wanna cut
my steak, too?

1282
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:29,816
So, I hear you got
a girl, Pete.

1283
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:33,240
What? No.
No, God, no.

1284
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,317
No, it's just this girl
I met at a mixer.

1285
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,324
Yeah, she's a DG.

1286
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:40,122
But we 're not-- you know,
we 're just friends.

1287
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:43,451
She's super athletic though.
She plays tennis and lacrosse.

1288
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:44,285
You'd really like her.

1289
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:46,336
Cool.

1290
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:49,541
But, you know, she's, she's not
my girlfriend or anything.

1291
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:50,966
We just started
hanging out.

1292
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,759
(Grandfather)
Yeah.

1293
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:56,635
Peter, it's okay for you
to have a girlfriend.

1294
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:58,637
It's pretty normal.
Right, Dad?

1295
01:18:01,552 --> 01:18:02,895
I'm not sure
I understand.

1296
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:05,393
You don't understand?

1297
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:07,770
Have you guys
had sex yet?

1298
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:08,851
Annie.

1299
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,732
Was she good?

1300
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:12,654
That's enough.

1301
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:14,277
(Annie)
What?

1302
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:19,032
You can tell everybody
about my life

1303
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:24,914
about me having sex and who
with, but I can't ask him?

1304
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:28,292
I asked you
not to tell him.

1305
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:31,465
That's the only
thing I asked.

1306
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:35,215
Thank you, Dad.

1307
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:40,050
I hope you guys
have an awesome time.

1308
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:42,100
(Lynn) Honey,
please, please stay.

1309
01:18:42,176 --> 01:18:43,644
(Annie)
No. No. Let me go.

1310
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:50,935
(Doug)
Okay. Good news.

1311
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:52,520
We ran the DNA
from his shirt

1312
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:54,355
through the national database.

1313
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:56,440
And we actually
found a match.

1314
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:57,991
That's, that's incredible.

1315
01:18:58,067 --> 01:18:59,660
So what happens now?
You arrest him?

1316
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,282
(Doug)
It's not that easy.

1317
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,535
While the DNA is
on the database

1318
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:06,037
it's still a John Doe- We
don't know who it belongs to.

1319
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,538
I don't
understand.

1320
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:09,211
Well, there were
other cases, Will

1321
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:11,380
three of them, where
rapes were reported.

1322
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:13,048
We were able to recover
genetic material

1323
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:14,796
from the victim
and the crime scene.

1324
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,923
The DNA profile
is the same.

1325
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,629
It's just that we don't know
who it belongs to.

1326
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:20,714
So he's done this before.

1327
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:23,096
- Yes, he has.
- (Lynn) Oh, my God.

1328
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,894
Well, he's had other girlfriends before.
I told you that.

1329
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,472
These weren't
girlfriends, Annie.

1330
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:28,806
These were minors
who reported a rape.

1331
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:31,187
Well, DNA can be wrong.

1332
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:34,897
The odds of these four samples
not coming from the same person

1333
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:38,779
are in the hundreds of millions.
It's the same guy.

1334
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:41,485
Now, look. We, uh, we
don't normally do this.

1335
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,286
We 're very careful
with victim information.

1336
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:44,989
But I'm hoping there
might be some kind

1337
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:47,495
of connection between
all four of you girls.

1338
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:49,497
Maybe you went to
the same camp together

1339
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:51,499
you shopped
at the same mall.

1340
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,296
I can't give you their names
but I was hoping that

1341
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:55,750
you might take a look
at their pictures.

1342
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,301
(Lynn) Wait a minute.
I don't know if this is a good idea.

1343
01:19:57,376 --> 01:19:59,879
No, no. I want,
I want to. Yeah.

1344
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:03,182
All right, Annie, do
you know this girl?

1345
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:05,009
She's from Cleveland.

1346
01:20:05,092 --> 01:20:06,514
She's fifteen years old.

1347
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:12,983
No.

1348
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:15,481
No? Okay.

1349
01:20:15,561 --> 01:20:17,063
This is the Milwaukee case.

1350
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:20,195
This photo was taken
about a year ago.

1351
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:23,494
She's fourteen.

1352
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:28,666
Now, this girl was assaulted in St.
Louis seven months ago.

1353
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:34,123
She's twelve.

1354
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,831
(Lynn)
Oh, my God.

1355
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:43,385
(Annie) I don't, I
don't know them.

1356
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:47,890
(Doug) Okay. It's okay.
You did a good job.

1357
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:49,140
Thank you, Annie.

1358
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:50,846
Honey.

1359
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:53,307
(Annie) No. I'm fine.
I just need a second.

1360
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,688
So you're telling me the FBI's
been chasing this guy for years?

1361
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:58,271
It looks that way, yeah.

1362
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:04,989
Look, on the upside, Will there's
more information for us.

1363
01:21:05,069 --> 01:21:06,946
There's more
evidence for us.

1364
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:09,248
The investigation is seeing
a real breakthrough.

1365
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:10,825
I bet the agent in St.
Louis said the same thing

1366
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:12,626
to some family
about seven months ago.

1367
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,294
I understand your
frustration, Will, I do

1368
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:15,792
but I'm working as hard
as I can for Annie.

1369
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:18,090
Yeah, but it's
not enough, is it?

1370
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:20,259
I mean, that sick fuck is still out
there grooming other girls, right?

1371
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:22,428
Will, I'm doing all I can.
I'm sorry you don't see it that way.

1372
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:25,598
(Lynn)
Annie? Annie!

1373
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:27,094
Did she come
down here?

1374
01:21:27,174 --> 01:21:29,051
[suspense music]

1375
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:33,810
[horn honking]

1376
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:41,356
(Gail)
You okay?

1377
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:43,691
You want something
to drink? Water?

1378
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:45,321
There were other girls.

1379
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:46,948
What other girls?
Tell me what you mean.

1380
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:49,371
Charlie. He had
other girls.

1381
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:52,950
Three of them.
Like me.

1382
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,706
There were other
victims, you mean?

1383
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:56,503
He said that I
was special.

1384
01:21:56,578 --> 01:22:00,924
That I was the only
one for him.

1385
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:03,127
But if there are
other girls--

1386
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:05,884
They weren't even-- They
weren't even that pretty!

1387
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:06,930
Tell me why it matters.

1388
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:08,177
No. No. No.

1389
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:10,931
Why does that
matter?

1390
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:15,606
[sobbing] Because they
were just like me.

1391
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:20,403
He told me, he said
I was pretty.

1392
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:24,527
What's wrong with me?

1393
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:27,860
Why does it mean that
something 's wrong with you?

1394
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:33,575
If he lied to me the way he lied to
those other girls, he never loved me.

1395
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:37,707
He lied so he could
have sex with me.

1396
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:42,416
What, Annie?

1397
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,591
Oh, my God.

1398
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:51,429
He raped me.

1399
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:55,433
He, he raped me.

1400
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:01,148
How could I have
been so stupid?

1401
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:04,947
All he wanted-- My God.

1402
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:06,695
All he wanted was--

1403
01:23:10,277 --> 01:23:13,281
God, I'm so sorry.

1404
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:42,605
(Lynn) Oh, God.
She's finally asleep.

1405
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:45,733
This guy is one sick fuck.

1406
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:52,821
Will, I'm so worried about her.
I've never seen her like this. I'm just--

1407
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:57,704
He's just destroyed her.
[sniffs]

1408
01:23:57,783 --> 01:23:59,956
He sent her
a picture of his dick.

1409
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,344
Please stop looking at this shit!
[thud]

1410
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:10,966
What are you doing?

1411
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:13,140
What the f--
What are you doing?

1412
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:16,219
Why are you down here when you
should be up there with her?

1413
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,349
You think finding this guy
is more important

1414
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:20,476
that it's gonna make her better?
Do you think that--

1415
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:23,651
Well, it might. Or it might save
some other poor fucking girl.

1416
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:27,946
I want this guy out of my house.
I want him out of my house!

1417
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:30,149
You want me to go up there and
talk to her? I've tried.

1418
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:31,575
She won't fucking
talk to me!

1419
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:32,822
Shut up!

1420
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:35,996
She finally fell asleep.

1421
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:40,201
You'd fucking know that if
you were up there with her.

1422
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:44,460
It's Annie.
It's Annie.

1423
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:47,963
She is in pain.
She needs you and you're just--

1424
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:51,261
You're sitting there
doing nothing!

1425
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:02,727
All right.

Look, Vicki's sick.
She can't play today.

1429
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:40,010
You're gonna start
in her place.

1430
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:41,265
I don't know, Coach. I--

1431
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:43,018
We need you, Annie.

1432
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:44,894
Can I count on you?

1433
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:48,477
Yeah.

1434
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,109
That's the spirit.

1435
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:52,360

Huh?

1447

You enjoying this, looking
at all the young girls?

1448
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:47,835
What's that?

(Lynn)
What are you doing?

1456
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:06,935
(Coach)
I'm calling the police.

no, there's no need

it's, it's just
a misunderstanding.

1459

Dad, you're hurt.

1460
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:16,448
No, no. Pumpkin, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm sorry if I scared you, I'm okay.

1461

- (Coach) Are you sure?
- (man) Absolutely.

1462

that's all.

going again, please? [blows whistle]

1465
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:30,128
How could you
do that to me?

1466
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:31,546
I'm really sorry.

1467
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:33,919
You're sorry?
Gee, Dad, thanks.

1468
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:35,967
That makes everything
so much better.

1469
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:38,886
I lost my temper.
I don't know what else to say. I'm sorry.

1470
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:42,717
Don't you get it?
There 's nothing anybody can say.

1471
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:44,051
My life is ruined.

No, it's not ruined.

We're going through a tough time
but your life's not ruined.

We're going through

We didn't get raped.

We're not the laughingstock
of New Trier. I am!

1477
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:02,740
I got raped. Not you!

1478
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:04,821
I know that.

1479
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:09,786
Nothing 's ever gonna be the same.
I know that.

1480

But, please, can you please stop
reminding me of it every second?

(Brit) Annie, wait!
I'm so sorry.

1482

(Annie) For what?
It's not your fault my dad's a psycho.

1483
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:42,652
What? No. I swear to God, I
had nothing to do with it.

Wait, what are
you talking about?

1485
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:47,030
The Internet thing.

What?

Are you okay?

01:34:52,729 --> 01:34:55,824
You remember the first
time you went in the pool?

What?

1540
01:34:58,484 --> 01:35:00,737
You probably don't.
You were two.

1541

Peter was scared to death
the first time he went in.

He screamed and cried so
much, he didn't stop.

He was fine in the
bath, but pool...

Not you.

1545
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:22,009
You were fearless.

01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:25,641
I remember.

1547
01:35:26,763 --> 01:35:29,733
You were amazing.

1548
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:33,186
Came in with me and almost
immediately started laughing

1549

and playing and
splashing around.

1550
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:41,237
You just had
this confidence.

1551
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:42,536
It wasn't just swimming.

1552
01:35:42,612 --> 01:35:44,080
You just had this--

1553
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:49,002
trust--in things, people,
the world.

1554
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:51,205
It was who you were.

1555
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:55,341
No fear.

1556
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:03,891
God, I loved that.

1557
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:06,311
I was so proud of it.

1558
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:09,772
I envied it.

1559
01:36:13,226 --> 01:36:16,230
And I was so afraid that you'd
lose it as you grew up.

1560
01:36:16,312 --> 01:36:19,065
That confidence.
That faith.

1561
01:36:20,566 --> 01:36:22,364
But you didn't.

1562
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:30,205
And then I failed you.

1563
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:36,879
It was my job to make
sure you didn't lose it.

1564
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:40,633
To keep you safe.

1565
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:43,591
What am I if I
can't protect you?

1566
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:51,143
And to see you lose
that confidence

1567
01:36:51,222 --> 01:36:53,941
to see you
question yourself.

1568
01:36:56,936 --> 01:36:58,938
That the idea would
even occur to you

1569
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:03,118
to want to hurt yourself.

1570
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:05,069
Or for you to think
for one minute

1571
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:07,656
that you weren't
as beautiful--

1572
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:24,882
I don't know if you can
ever forgive me, Annie.

1573
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:30,687
I really don't know
if you should.

1574
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:34,687
But I'm sorry.

1575
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:37,360
I'm so sorry.

1577
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:46,152
I love you so much.

1579
01:38:09,008 --> 01:38:11,682

How much longer?

1580
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:14,184

got here, buddy.
