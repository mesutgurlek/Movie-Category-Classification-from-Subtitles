1
00:02:08,636 --> 00:02:10,467
What are you reading?

2
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:14,304
- Nothing. I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

3
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,842
- Will that be all?
- Yes.

4
00:02:24,585 --> 00:02:27,748
This machine drives me crazy.
I'll register it later.

5
00:02:27,822 --> 00:02:33,658
- 1.25 plus 3.75...
- 5.

6
00:02:33,728 --> 00:02:38,097
Yes, five, of course.
Don't you have a smaller bill?

7
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,135
- Not enough change.
- I'll make it.

8
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:54,008
What an idiot! I do have it.
The change from the taxi.

9
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:58,040
The taxi-driver's change.
I took it all from him.

10
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:03,022
10, 20, 30, 40, 50.
I'm sure you need the change.

11
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:07,893
If you have a 100 bill, I'll give
you 50, and 50, 100, in change.

12
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:10,992
Yes.

13
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,337
- Bye, thanks.
- Bye.

14
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,884
- Bye.
- Bye.

15
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:15,528
- Hi.
- Hi.

16
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:27,199
We'll put it over there.

17
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:32,773
- He did that to me.
- What?

18
00:04:32,847 --> 00:04:37,546
You know, the change.
Be careful, Betina.

19
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:39,916
He's pulling a trick
to take money from you.

20
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:42,512
- What the fuck's going on?
- He pulled a trick on me!

21
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,028
- He took money from me!
- Son of a bitch! Call the police!

22
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:50,827
- That won't be necessary. Don't call.
- Who the hell are you?

23
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:56,693
You thought I'd forget, right?

24
00:04:56,771 --> 00:05:01,401
You think I'm a prick,
just like all the assholes you swindle?

25
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:02,965
Is that it? You fucking thief!

26
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:08,843
- Freeze, motherfucker! Don't resist.
- I won't resist.

27
00:05:12,954 --> 00:05:14,546
Stop it, goddamit, look... !

28
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:16,681
Who the fuck do you think
you are talking to?

29
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:20,358
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

30
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:26,758
Is this the money you took from her?
Is this it?

31
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:33,804
You'll get a call from the precinct.

32
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,708
To file your report
and to return this to you.

33
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:43,109
Don't move from here.

34
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:11,235
Do you smoke?

35
00:06:12,046 --> 00:06:14,708
- Smoke these?
- No.

36
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:17,411
A pity. I no longer smoke.

37
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,119
Crunchy...

38
00:06:30,798 --> 00:06:33,028
made in Greece.

39
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:36,996
This country is going to hell.

40
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,306
Do you want?

41
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,141
I'm such an asshole!

42
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,312
What an asshole!

43
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:07,329
It's not that bad.

44
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,597
I should know when someone's
pulling a trick on me.

45
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:14,238
Depends on who's doing it.

46
00:07:15,743 --> 00:07:19,076
- It was the gun that convinced me.
- The gun?

47
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,473
The only thing handy.

48
00:07:27,455 --> 00:07:30,288
Are you mad, kid?

49
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:36,329
"He pulled a trick on me! "

50
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:45,367
Why did you help me out?

51
00:07:46,474 --> 00:07:49,568
It was a pity you'd get canned
for 45 lousy bucks.

52
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:54,776
- How d'you know it's 45?
- I did that trick a million times.

53
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,840
And I know you can't
do it twice at the same store.

54
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:00,978
You get in, you do it
and you get out... that's it.

55
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:03,856
Unless you want
to get beaten and canned...

56
00:08:03,924 --> 00:08:06,154
not necessarily in that order.

57
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:09,289
- You are a swindler.
- A dentist.

58
00:08:10,464 --> 00:08:14,525
- The professional felt pity for the asshole.
- Beginner.

59
00:08:16,837 --> 00:08:19,829
I hope one day
I'm as good as you, teacher.

60
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:22,375
Thanks anyway. Goodbye.

61
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:25,135
Hold it!

62
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:30,580
What do you want?

63
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:34,079
That's a strange way
of saying thanks.

64
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:36,146
I said thanks.
What else do you want?

65
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:37,713
Not me, what do you want?

66
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:40,488
- What do I want?
- Survive, I guess.

67
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:47,064
- I can teach you a couple of tricks.
- Why?

68
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:51,097
Because otherwise...
you're headed for trouble.

69
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:54,972
- Thanks a lot, but I'm doing fine.
- Yeah, I can see that.

70
00:08:55,976 --> 00:08:58,342
I'm not the smartest
but I'm street-wise...

71
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:01,210
and I know that nobody gives
you anything for free...

72
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:02,772
especially someone like you.

73
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,841
- What d'you want?
- I already told you.

74
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:06,920
Try telling me the truth.

75
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,287
I work with another guy,
a partner, Turco.

76
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,331
He disappeared a week ago, completely.

77
00:09:26,574 --> 00:09:28,872
The thing is, I need a partner.

78
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:32,304
I don't know how
to work on my own, I can't.

79
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,642
I saw you at the gas station
and I thought...

80
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:39,380
perhaps...

81
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:42,886
Why me?

82
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:46,089
Why not?

83
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:53,992
No, look... I work alone,
and besides, I don't know you.

84
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:57,067
I'm Marcos... and you are... ?

85
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,600
Juan.

86
00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:02,835
Juan. But you've
always wanted to be called...

87
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,337
Sebastin.

88
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:10,178
Guys called Juan
always want another name.

89
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:11,616
Let's do business, Sebastin?

90
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:14,017
- Juan.
- Juan.

91
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:18,189
Just for today, one day only.
Then you can decide.

92
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,723
- No, thanks.
- It's up to you to do it.

93
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:27,733
If you want to keep on
playing in the little leagues.

94
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:34,802
Here, kid.
Don't lose your money.

95
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,974
Hey... Marcos...

96
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:46,410
Just for today.

97
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:49,857
- Who is it?
- Auntie?

98
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,415
- Who is it?
- Auntie?

99
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:53,892
- No, who is it?
- I'm sorry.

100
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:55,952
- Who is it?
- Auntie?

101
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,361
- No. What auntie?
- Excuse me.

102
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:01,228
- Hello?
- Auntie?

103
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,026
- No, wrong floor.
- Excuse me.

104
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,765
- Who is it?
- Auntie?

105
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:09,399
Who is it?

106
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,185
Wait, wait...

107
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:22,046
Hang on.

108
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,801
- Do you have kids?
- No.

109
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:37,735
- And that?
- It's for me.

110
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:41,138
I had one like it when I was a kid.
A bit larger than this one.

111
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,403
It belonged to my father.

112
00:11:43,477 --> 00:11:45,945
When there was
a game on TV...

113
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:48,379
it was one of the few
days Dad stayed at home.

114
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:53,113
I'd set my wooden racetrack
and play with the car.

115
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:56,247
Mum would listen
to her favorite record by Rita Pavone.

116
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,289
- Rita Pavone?
- Yes.

117
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,818
A real fan. She wouldn't
acknowledge she was outdated.

118
00:12:03,964 --> 00:12:06,524
When we were together
at home we listened...

119
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,559
to Rita Pavone. "II Ballo
del Mattone." Know the song?

120
00:12:10,638 --> 00:12:11,969
- Who is it?
- Auntie?

121
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,269
- No, wrong floor.
- Excuse me.

122
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:17,376
It was very popular.
They used the song for a movie...

123
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:20,277
Mom told me.
It went...

124
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:29,046
- Who is it?
- I see.

125
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,320
- Auntie?
- Yes. Who is it?

126
00:12:32,593 --> 00:12:35,187
You can't recognize
your favorite nephew?

127
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:38,095
- Fabin, is that you?
- Yes, Auntie, it's Fabin.

128
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:41,328
It's been a long time, dear.
What a miracle!

129
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:45,839
You got a cold? I can't hear you well.
I hardly recognize you.

130
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:47,663
You came to visit me?

131
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:50,801
No, you'll be mad at me.
I'm with a friend...

132
00:12:50,878 --> 00:12:56,145
We came to visit someone
near here and my car broke down.

133
00:12:56,216 --> 00:12:57,478
The car?

134
00:12:57,551 --> 00:12:59,644
- Yes.
- You bought a car?

135
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,553
You didn't know?
You gotta see it. You'll love it.

136
00:13:02,623 --> 00:13:06,559
- Guess what color it is.
- What color? Don't tell me.

137
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:08,592
Turquoise.

138
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:12,598
No, I wanted turquoise
but I got a blue one.

139
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,500
The thing is, they're about
to tow it to the garage...

140
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,028
...and after checking my wallet
I realized I got no money.

141
00:13:20,107 --> 00:13:22,098
It was then I noticed
I was close to your place...

142
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,873
How could you?
You have to check before going out.

143
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:28,005
Don't give me a hard time.

144
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:33,076
Could you lend me some money?
Say 50, 60 pesos.

145
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:36,145
I'll go to the garage,
get the cash and bring it back to you.

146
00:13:36,223 --> 00:13:40,319
You needn't do it so fast.
But we could have a coffee.

147
00:13:40,394 --> 00:13:43,625
I promise, auntie.
We'll have a coffee together.

148
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,461
Look, I don't want
to leave the car alone.

149
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:48,865
My friend's staying here,
give him the money.

150
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:50,870
Don't worry.

151
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:53,236
I'm coming down.
Your friend can be trusted?

152
00:14:10,657 --> 00:14:12,591
She gave me a hundred.

153
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:17,262
- Nice old lady.
- She sends her love to your mother.

154
00:14:18,499 --> 00:14:21,593
I'd have to go to the cemetery,
too much trouble.

155
00:14:21,668 --> 00:14:24,136
And she gave me this
to give back to her.

156
00:14:26,974 --> 00:14:30,410
- Why didn't you keep it?
- I'm not a crook.

157
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,508
- What is it?
- Nothing.

158
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:36,446
- You want the ring?
- No, it's not that.

159
00:14:36,517 --> 00:14:38,815
- What is it?
- The old lady...

160
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,347
Let me get this straight:
gas station clerks, it's okay...

161
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,823
trusting old ladies, never.

162
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:48,058
It's not that. She told me
I looked like her grandson.

163
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:52,326
Give her back the money
and set up a grocery store.

164
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,333
What's wrong with you?

165
00:14:54,401 --> 00:14:57,268
How can you work the streets
with such a conscience?

166
00:14:57,337 --> 00:15:01,398
- That's my problem.
- No, that's our problem. For today.

167
00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:11,451
Hang on. Since we are here...

168
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:19,423
Go in, order a coffee...

169
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:24,796
pay with this, and get out.

170
00:15:24,865 --> 00:15:26,662
You don't know me.

171
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:11,674
I need money.

172
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,270
That's original.

173
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,543
No, I need money, now...

174
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:20,485
Lots of it.
That's why I'm on the streets.

175
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:22,647
You feel ambitious today?

176
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:26,422
No, it's my father.
I'm gathering money for him.

177
00:16:26,493 --> 00:16:28,654
- How much?
- A lot.

178
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:30,594
Come on, how much?

179
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:34,197
Seventy grand.

180
00:16:34,268 --> 00:16:36,293
Holy shit!
What is it with your father?

181
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,504
- He's in trouble.
- And you solve your dad's problems?

182
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:48,440
Yes, we get along fine.
He taught me the tricks for working.

183
00:16:48,515 --> 00:16:50,540
When I was a kid, as a game.

184
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:54,110
- "Mosqueta", "Toco Mocho"...
- The basics...

185
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,551
Then something happened,
I don't know what.

186
00:16:59,092 --> 00:17:02,255
He regretted having taught me.
He said it was wrong.

187
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:07,633
He told me not to screw up
my life like he had screwed his.

188
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:11,298
He told me to do
something else. Anything.

189
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:14,470
I did as he said.
I did something.

190
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,601
- And it didn't work.
- Everything I did was a failure.

191
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,078
What did you say when asked
what you wanted to be?

192
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,142
- Left wing.
- I wanted to be an accomplice.

193
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:31,723
I heard it a lot at home...

194
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,123
and what can you do
for a living with such a vocation?

195
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:36,219
Minister?

196
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:40,323
Now that my Dad needs
the money the only way...

197
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,561
to get it is to use
the tricks he taught me.

198
00:17:44,204 --> 00:17:48,197
I try hard to remember each phrase,
and each flick of the hands.

199
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,402
I sold my apartment to start...

200
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:53,738
an import business that
didn't even get off the ground.

201
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:58,750
Well, the 7 0 grand is still there,
like the carrot...

202
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:02,380
I'm an asshole, the 50 grand
I scraped are good for nothing.

203
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:11,960
You were saying?

204
00:18:19,406 --> 00:18:22,466
- My change, please. I've got to go.
- What change, Sir?

205
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:25,033
The change for the $1 00
I gave you ten minutes ago.

206
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:28,673
- No, you gave me nothing.
- Come on, I'm in a hurry.

207
00:18:28,749 --> 00:18:32,947
- You didn't pay me.
- Are you serving too many tables?

208
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:34,619
Shall I help you? Manager!

209
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:39,057
- You didn't pay. Don't shout.
- Don't tell me what to do.

210
00:18:39,126 --> 00:18:40,093
- Manager!
- What is it?

211
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,151
This gentleman says
he paid me but it's not true.

212
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:45,460
- Are you calling me a liar?
- No, sir. There must be a confusion.

213
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:48,365
No. I had a coffee and paid
with a $1 00 bill.

214
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:50,460
I had two,
now I've got one.

215
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:52,698
Check.
Maybe you got confused.

216
00:18:52,773 --> 00:18:56,334
Don't insist with the confusion bit.
There's no confusion. Look.

217
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:00,642
I had two bills, now I have one.
Look, that's it.

218
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:03,716
The tip is cut off.
The bill I paid with is missing the tip.

219
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:06,947
Check in your register box
if there's a bill with a missing tip.

220
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,885
Cut it, I'm in a hurry.

221
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:10,582
- Come.
- I'm not going anywhere.

222
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:14,991
Go get my change.
I'm not going anywhere. Are you nuts?

223
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:18,430
What is it?

224
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:23,801
Your cut. Like it?

225
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:25,902
- I knew this trick.
- You do it?

226
00:19:25,972 --> 00:19:27,405
- No.
- Why?

227
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:29,567
Too many people around.
You have to make a scandal.

228
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:33,170
- It's not my style.
- But that's the point, pal.

229
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,948
They are not prepared to get
into a scandal. What's the key?

230
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:39,281
The more offended you are,
the less suspicious you look.

231
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,946
If things get tough,
you accuse the rest of them.

232
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,353
Not my style.

233
00:19:43,423 --> 00:19:46,392
- What part?
- The exposure, I don't like it.

234
00:19:46,526 --> 00:19:48,858
The risk of something going wrong.

235
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:51,989
- Lf the going gets rough, I can't do it.
- You chose the wrong job.

236
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:54,628
I didn't choose.

237
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:05,611
D'you have some small change?
I have to make a call.

238
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:13,345
It's private... you know...

239
00:20:23,897 --> 00:20:25,125
Arrange it. Bye.

240
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:31,537
Who were you talking to?

241
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:37,206
With my lawyer.
I still have some outstanding business.

242
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:47,711
- Who was it?
- A friend.

243
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:52,054
Okay, what's next?

244
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,590
I don't know.

245
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:59,690
In fact I've been thinking...
I don't know if it's worth it.

246
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:04,596
All this... perhaps it's best
that you go on with your stuff.

247
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,705
Turco must be coming
back soon and...

248
00:21:08,775 --> 00:21:11,403
if he finds out I've replaced him,
he'll get mad.

249
00:21:12,012 --> 00:21:13,502
Turco is a bit jealous.

250
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,146
No, wait, what is it?

251
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:23,581
Nothing... this is not for you.
You're not into it.

252
00:21:24,424 --> 00:21:26,984
- You could fuck up, and if that happens...
- What could I fuck up?

253
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,722
What kind of an idiot d'you think I am?

254
00:21:29,796 --> 00:21:32,390
- The kind who thinks too much.
- Is that a liability?

255
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:33,932
- It's a liability.
- Why?

256
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,697
If you think too much,
you won't do some things.

257
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:41,730
Look, I need the money.

258
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:45,642
Splitting 50% with you, I'll make more
than 1 00% if I were on my own.

259
00:21:45,712 --> 00:21:48,306
This is not about learning
a couple of tricks.

260
00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:52,317
Any asshole knows it.
You need something else for this job.

261
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:54,043
Talent...

262
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:56,511
and you've got it.

263
00:21:57,324 --> 00:21:59,292
Otherwise, I wouldn't be alive.

264
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,590
Are you that good?
Can you achieve anything you set out for?

265
00:22:02,662 --> 00:22:04,061
Anything.

266
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,099
Can you get that purse
in less than two minutes?

267
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:16,036
- She has to voluntarily hand me her purse?
- In two minutes.

268
00:22:17,077 --> 00:22:18,510
No, not that.

269
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:21,911
- I can.
- No, you can't.

270
00:22:21,982 --> 00:22:23,847
I bet you the ring.

271
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:43,961
- Hi.
- Hi.

272
00:22:50,076 --> 00:22:52,544
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

273
00:22:55,315 --> 00:22:56,805
- What floor, madam?
- Fourth.

274
00:22:56,883 --> 00:22:59,374
- And you?
- The penthouse.

275
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,133
- What is it?
- I don't know.

276
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:22,298
These old elevators,
they break down, they fall down.

277
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:26,104
- Please, don't say that.
- It happens all the time.

278
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,590
Holy shit!

279
00:23:42,862 --> 00:23:45,922
- Let's get help.
- Makes sense.

280
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:49,594
No, we'll do something else.

281
00:23:52,238 --> 00:23:55,332
- We're going out and we'll use the stairs.
- That way?

282
00:23:57,577 --> 00:23:59,408
Let me help you.

283
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:04,910
Your purse,
I'll place it here.

284
00:24:05,952 --> 00:24:08,250
Shall I hold it for you?

285
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:19,695
- I didn't know that one.
- Neither did I.

286
00:24:20,734 --> 00:24:22,599
- You improvised?
- Yes.

287
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,363
- Really?
- Yes.

288
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:28,498
That was fast.

289
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,281
And you have another asset
that'll make your life easier.

290
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:40,183
Something money can't buy.
You look like a nice guy.

291
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:45,122
Incredible! Once again you've
sent me the wrong paper!

292
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:47,182
I'm sick and tired of
coming myself to get it!

293
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,525
- What's your address?
- Viamonte 1 2 42, 2nd. "B".

294
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:02,533
- You're so cheap. Can't you buy it?
- Don't call me cheap.

295
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,776
Are you upset?

296
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,041
Of course I can buy it,
but I can also not buy it.

297
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:11,481
As everybody else would do if they could.

298
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:15,351
- D'you think everybody is like you?
- Like me? Most.

299
00:25:15,422 --> 00:25:19,358
- The thing is they don't have enough balls.
- At least it's most.

300
00:25:19,426 --> 00:25:22,054
Then there's the decent folk,
and then there's you...

301
00:25:22,128 --> 00:25:24,756
and you would be... what?

302
00:25:24,831 --> 00:25:26,560
What's up, man?

303
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,529
You wouldn't have gotten her out
of the elevator, would you?

304
00:25:31,337 --> 00:25:33,430
- What are you talking about?
- The purse.

305
00:25:33,506 --> 00:25:36,907
- You would have walked away with it.
- What do you mean?

306
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:40,802
You think I'm a thief?

307
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:45,214
I don't kill people.
I don't use a piece. Anyone can do that.

308
00:25:45,285 --> 00:25:47,981
Do you want to see thieves?
Come.

309
00:25:49,255 --> 00:25:50,586
Those two are...

310
00:25:50,657 --> 00:25:53,956
waiting for someone
with a briefcase on the street side.

311
00:25:55,662 --> 00:25:59,598
That one,
sizing up loaded victims.

312
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,701
They are there,
but you can't see them.

313
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,761
That's what it's all about.
They're there, but they aren't.

314
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,297
So mind your briefcase,
your case, your door...

315
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:14,005
your window, your car,
your savings.

316
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,914
Mind your ass. Because they're
there and they'll always be.

317
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:22,114
- Thieves.
- No... that's what everybody calls them.

318
00:26:22,188 --> 00:26:27,649
They are spitters, breakers,
skin workers, blind fronts...

319
00:26:27,727 --> 00:26:33,597
hoisters, hooks, stalls, petermans,
night raiders, spitters...

320
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:40,765
mustard chuckers, fences,
operators, swindlers...

321
00:26:44,077 --> 00:26:46,807
I'm hungry.
Let's go to my office to get a meal.

322
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:53,245
What is it?

323
00:27:13,706 --> 00:27:16,106
Sit there, wait for me.

324
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:20,042
- Anibal, could you clear my desk?
- Your sister called.

325
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:22,476
How d'you know it was my sister?

326
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:24,779
She said she was
your sister, Valeria.

327
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,546
I didn't know you had a sister.

328
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:29,588
- Yes, I got a sister.
- What time did she call?

329
00:27:29,656 --> 00:27:33,285
- About an hour ago.
- Did she say what she wanted?

330
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,351
Get an office with a secretary
and stop busting my balls.

331
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:38,590
Get me something to eat,
something tasty.

332
00:27:42,735 --> 00:27:45,499
If you don't mind,
I'll choose the meal next time.

333
00:27:45,572 --> 00:27:47,699
You're a pain in the ass, kid.

334
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,240
- When?
- This morning.

335
00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:53,779
- What did you say?
- That you were hospitalized.

336
00:27:56,983 --> 00:27:59,781
- Why were you hospitalized?
- No...

337
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:04,779
I think I'm running out of credit.

338
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:11,254
I'm a mess with money.
It's hard for me to...

339
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:16,023
- A mess?
- Your sister.

340
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:19,097
Hello.

341
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:24,374
Either we never get to talk
or we speak twice the same day.

342
00:28:25,778 --> 00:28:28,406
No, I can't now.

343
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:31,743
And why should it concern me?

344
00:28:31,985 --> 00:28:34,112
If you're fucking with me
to get me to go and talk about...

345
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:36,212
our grandparents' estate

346
00:28:36,556 --> 00:28:39,491
Wait. Wait a minute!

347
00:28:42,061 --> 00:28:44,461
Alright, I'm on my way.
Yes!

348
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:51,392
- Problems?
- I don't know. Maybe.

349
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:54,736
I'm going to see my sister.

350
00:28:54,807 --> 00:28:56,502
And what shall I do?

351
00:28:58,478 --> 00:29:00,776
Come along.
You never know with my sister.

352
00:29:00,847 --> 00:29:03,941
Maybe I might need a witness.
Pay for this. I'll pay you later.

353
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:14,526
- Your sister works here?
- Yes.

354
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:17,928
- Does she... ?
- No.

355
00:29:18,364 --> 00:29:20,924
My sister is a responsible person.

356
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:21,158
- A miracle. I called and you came.
- I'm fine, thanks. And you?

357
00:30:21,227 --> 00:30:24,219
Fine, we are fine.
Thanks for your concern.

358
00:30:24,297 --> 00:30:25,855
You called to give me shit?

359
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:28,196
I'm trying to keep the party going,
to be polite.

360
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:30,735
I wish it was a party.
You needn't be polite.

361
00:30:30,803 --> 00:30:33,772
It'd be enough if you just
carried out your responsibilities.

362
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,899
I heard that song before.
I think it was your mother singing it.

363
00:30:35,975 --> 00:30:39,308
- You're a bastard!
- Watch your mouth.

364
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:43,076
Be careful your bosses might listen.
How many are they? Ten, twenty?

365
00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:46,414
Never seen a woman
with as many bosses as she has.

366
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,214
- Who is this?
- Juan, a friend.

367
00:30:49,756 --> 00:30:52,520
- I called you.
- And I came with him. What d'you want?

368
00:30:52,825 --> 00:30:54,122
Come here.

369
00:30:58,598 --> 00:31:01,328
How many times did I ask you
not to meddle with the hotel...

370
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,392
and its guests, that you do
your business elsewhere?

371
00:31:03,469 --> 00:31:04,458
Too many.

372
00:31:04,537 --> 00:31:06,767
I was at the lobby and
that partner of yours, the old man...

373
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,999
what was his name?

374
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,871
- Sandler?
- That's it.

375
00:31:09,942 --> 00:31:11,933
- I thought he had died.
- Don't fuck with me.

376
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:14,002
I'm not. I haven't seen him
in six or seven years.

377
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,605
Besides, he wasn't my partner.
He does something else.

378
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:20,584
He was at the lobby insisting
on seeing a guest.

379
00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:22,848
I thought it was one of your affairs.

380
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,082
You're wrong.

381
00:31:24,157 --> 00:31:28,059
I had you called, they didn't find you,
and I had him sent out.

382
00:31:28,127 --> 00:31:29,788
You've become a snitch?

383
00:31:29,862 --> 00:31:35,300
This is my job and I work my ass off
1 2 hours a day to keep it.

384
00:31:36,335 --> 00:31:38,633
I hope you don't
mean it literally.

385
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:46,003
When the old man was being
thrown out, he had a seizure...

386
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:47,705
He fainted.

387
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,714
The house doctor
has already seen him...

388
00:31:50,883 --> 00:31:52,578
and they'll call an ambulance shortly.

389
00:31:52,652 --> 00:31:54,643
What does all this have
to do with me?

390
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,020
The old man recognized me and
asked me, begged me to call you...

391
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:01,616
that it was urgent,
he needed to talk to you.

392
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,994
My life is quite a mess as it is.

393
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:11,402
Make sure he doesn't come back.
Neither do you.

394
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,735
- You called me.
- He did.

395
00:32:14,006 --> 00:32:15,974
Whatever you have to settle,
do it and go away.

396
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:17,873
It makes me nervous
to see you here.

397
00:32:17,944 --> 00:32:20,640
You're as loving as always.

398
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:24,374
By the way, are you dating someone,
did you get married?

399
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:28,881
I'm dating.
It will be one year tomorrow.

400
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:34,082
- Congratulations. I know him?
- I don't think so. He's decent.

401
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:42,027
Nice ass, right?

402
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:53,000
Marquitos, you came.

403
00:32:53,546 --> 00:32:57,915
- You called me, Sandler.
- I thought... you know...

404
00:32:59,318 --> 00:33:00,751
And him?

405
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,846
He's with me. If you want to
I can ask him to leave.

406
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,018
Juan?

407
00:33:19,572 --> 00:33:22,234
Aren't you Juan, Ramiro's kid?

408
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,501
I worked with
your father many years ago.

409
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:32,280
I would forge the papers for him,
and he pushed them.

410
00:33:32,618 --> 00:33:36,884
- Sandler is an artist.
- Yes, an artist.

411
00:33:38,758 --> 00:33:41,420
- I made you make big money.
- Those were other times.

412
00:33:43,262 --> 00:33:46,356
- You don't remember me?
- No.

413
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:50,861
You were a little kid then.

414
00:33:52,138 --> 00:33:55,073
Perhaps ten, twelve.

415
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,202
- Good memory.
- He was a smart kid.

416
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:06,476
This is all very touching
but why did you have me called?

417
00:34:11,657 --> 00:34:13,648
Hand me the briefcase.

418
00:34:17,363 --> 00:34:24,701
Esteban Vidal Gandolfo is
a guest at this hotel.

419
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:26,598
Do you know him?

420
00:34:31,711 --> 00:34:34,145
DEPORTATION
OF VI DAL GANDOLFO

421
00:34:35,748 --> 00:34:38,216
"Owns a holding."

422
00:34:39,852 --> 00:34:42,446
"Must leave the country in a hurry."

423
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:46,413
"Parliamentary investigation.
Deportation to Venezuela."

424
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,225
Five hundred million dollars?

425
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:56,031
Whatever it is, it's too big for you.

426
00:34:56,102 --> 00:34:58,866
He's got a hobby.
He's worth 500 million...

427
00:34:59,605 --> 00:35:01,573
and he's got a hobby.

428
00:35:02,408 --> 00:35:04,774
- Which one?
- Stamps.

429
00:35:12,752 --> 00:35:16,279
- Didn't you have a... ?
- Brother-in-law. A stamp collector.

430
00:35:16,355 --> 00:35:19,813
A very good one.
The husband of my sister, Berta.

431
00:35:19,892 --> 00:35:22,952
- The one who lives at the Kavanagh.
- My rich sister.

432
00:35:23,029 --> 00:35:27,295
He died eight, nine years ago,
and left her the whole collection...

433
00:35:27,366 --> 00:35:29,926
including the "Nine Queens".

434
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,128
Nine Queens?

435
00:35:32,071 --> 00:35:36,064
The Nine Queens is a sheet
of stamps from the Weimar Republic.

436
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:41,478
- Defective, rare and very valuable.
- How much?

437
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:45,043
I don't know.
I didn't have time to establish a price.

438
00:35:46,118 --> 00:35:48,552
You wanted to sell them
to Vidal Gandolfo?

439
00:35:48,621 --> 00:35:53,183
My sister's stamps? No, not hers.

440
00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:55,591
She wouldn't sell them.

441
00:35:55,661 --> 00:35:59,859
She says they remind her
of her husband. No.

442
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,728
So?

443
00:36:03,302 --> 00:36:05,930
But I got to see them.

444
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:09,569
I studied them.
I took photographs.

445
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:14,177
- You copied them.
- My best work ever.

446
00:36:15,681 --> 00:36:19,947
Original paper.
1 920.

447
00:36:20,786 --> 00:36:23,550
Hand-cut.
One perforation at a time.

448
00:36:23,622 --> 00:36:28,116
This is one of your photos?

449
00:36:29,795 --> 00:36:32,195
The trick is the time.

450
00:36:32,665 --> 00:36:34,929
I know they wouldn't pass a lab test.

451
00:36:36,635 --> 00:36:40,594
But they're taking the guy
to the airport tomorrow.

452
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,303
He doesn't have the time
to check them thoroughly.

453
00:36:44,877 --> 00:36:46,902
That's why they must be sold today.

454
00:36:47,613 --> 00:36:53,279
He'll go for it.
He must believe it's now or never.

455
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:59,414
Please, take me to the toilet.

456
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:07,757
Easy.

457
00:37:15,908 --> 00:37:20,106
- Do you know this Spaniard?
- I read something about him.

458
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,940
Then he exists.

459
00:37:23,482 --> 00:37:25,643
Yes, of course he exists.

460
00:37:28,988 --> 00:37:31,388
Let me get this straight.

461
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:34,187
You came to the hotel
asking for the Spaniard.

462
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,524
When you couldn't get through,
you got nervous...

463
00:37:36,595 --> 00:37:39,928
because you thought you'd blown it.
Is that so?

464
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,798
It was then that you blew your fuse.

465
00:37:49,975 --> 00:37:54,071
So you need someone
to sell the goods for you...

466
00:37:54,346 --> 00:37:55,335
today.

467
00:37:56,949 --> 00:37:58,439
Why me, of all people?

468
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:02,650
When I fell ill I saw
your sister and I thought...

469
00:38:03,422 --> 00:38:07,153
Why not?
It's been a long time.

470
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:13,989
You didn't expect this, did you?
Here I am, trusting you again.

471
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:18,730
You're desperate.
You had no one else to call.

472
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,770
I can give you 20%.

473
00:38:23,976 --> 00:38:24,806
No.

474
00:38:27,413 --> 00:38:29,176
No, look...

475
00:38:30,115 --> 00:38:33,016
Let me tell you what the situation is...

476
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:36,484
You don't set the percentages, I do.

477
00:38:36,555 --> 00:38:38,819
Because if I leave now...

478
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:42,292
all you'll get will be
an enema at a public hospital.

479
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:45,554
Listen, I'm 73.

480
00:38:45,998 --> 00:38:48,091
I don't have many opportunities left...

481
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:50,931
and this one is mine, rightfully.

482
00:38:51,303 --> 00:38:55,034
Don't fuck with me, Marcos.
I can call someone else.

483
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:58,668
If you could call someone else,
you'd have already done so.

484
00:38:59,078 --> 00:39:01,103
How much do you want?

485
00:39:02,748 --> 00:39:04,443
90%.

486
00:39:05,651 --> 00:39:07,551
You are crazy.

487
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:11,715
No, the thing is I got you by the balls.

488
00:39:12,424 --> 00:39:15,985
- Let's do it 50-50.
- I'm not negotiating.

489
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:19,527
I'm making you
the only offer you'll ever get.

490
00:39:19,765 --> 00:39:22,097
1 0% for you...

491
00:39:22,268 --> 00:39:24,259
or nothing, zip.

492
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,861
I didn't come to you, Sandler.

493
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:30,531
It was the other way round.

494
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,144
I never learn.

495
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,310
- I'm an asshole.
- You're not an asshole. You are fucked up.

496
00:39:41,487 --> 00:39:43,182
Well?

497
00:40:13,552 --> 00:40:16,453
The wife has the stamps at their place.

498
00:40:16,522 --> 00:40:18,786
If I tell her he sends me,
she'll give them to me.

499
00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:21,690
He asked me not to mention the hospital.
He doesn't want to scare her.

500
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,751
D'you know anything
about stamps?

501
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:26,161
They're small square papers
you stick on envelopes.

502
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:28,791
- You'll go ahead with it?
- Sure!

503
00:40:28,867 --> 00:40:30,528
- What?
- Nothing.

504
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:32,729
- I find it a bit strange.
- Which part?

505
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:36,241
- All of it.
- Strange? You find it strange?

506
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:39,443
Kid, I've sold barbed wire seeds
and got thanked for it.

507
00:40:39,511 --> 00:40:42,480
D'you think I can get scared
with some stamps?

508
00:40:42,548 --> 00:40:47,850
What can I lose? I risk nothing.
If I sell, I keep everything.

509
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,388
And if the cops get involved?

510
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,355
No, kid.
This is something else.

511
00:40:53,425 --> 00:40:56,917
This is something you can wait for your
entire life and could never happen.

512
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,226
One in a million.

513
00:40:59,298 --> 00:41:01,198
The old man is a good artist.

514
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:05,794
He's the best.
And I can sell those stamps.

515
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:10,935
- I can probably get... thirty grand.
- Thirty grand?

516
00:41:11,977 --> 00:41:14,878
- More, you think?
- Come.

517
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:21,942
What is it?
What do you want?

518
00:41:22,087 --> 00:41:24,578
- I want in.
- In where?

519
00:41:24,656 --> 00:41:27,819
The deal. I need the cash.
I want a part.

520
00:41:27,893 --> 00:41:30,054
A part? Are you crazy?

521
00:41:30,129 --> 00:41:32,563
I don't mean much.
Just a percentage.

522
00:41:32,631 --> 00:41:34,189
We're together for the day.

523
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:36,826
Why should I give you a percentage?

524
00:41:36,902 --> 00:41:40,531
This reached me through my sister.

525
00:41:40,606 --> 00:41:43,097
- Who the fuck d'you think you are?
- Well, I was there.

526
00:41:43,175 --> 00:41:45,803
Fuck that! You don't even
know Sandler's address.

527
00:41:48,814 --> 00:41:51,647
I'll need help. Stay with me
for a lump sum... a grand.

528
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,413
- Three.
- One and a half.

529
00:41:54,486 --> 00:41:56,954
- Two and a half.
- Okay, two.

530
00:41:57,022 --> 00:41:59,286
- Two and a half.
- Alright!

531
00:41:59,858 --> 00:42:02,088
Only if we pull it off.

532
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:47,030
- What was the name of the guy?
- None of your business.

533
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,870
- Vidal Garafalo?
- Gandolfo.

534
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:52,067
Gandolfo. He likes you.

535
00:42:52,144 --> 00:42:55,113
I'd like to talk to you about...
Why do you ask?

536
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,807
It's nothing.

537
00:42:56,882 --> 00:42:59,817
- Don't mess with that guy...
- I'll be back.

538
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:17,659
D'you remember a song by R. Pavone,
II Ballo del Mattone?

539
00:43:28,847 --> 00:43:31,042
That's it, let's go.
We won't bother you again.

540
00:43:31,116 --> 00:43:33,812
What about
our grandparent's estate?

541
00:43:33,886 --> 00:43:35,854
Not again.
Talk to your lawyer.

542
00:43:35,921 --> 00:43:38,185
Don't fuck with me,
your lawyer's delaying it.

543
00:43:38,257 --> 00:43:41,226
- That's what lawyers are for.
- Do it for Federico.

544
00:43:41,293 --> 00:43:43,853
- What does he have to do?
- You're screwing him too.

545
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:46,397
- The third part is his.
- I'm not screwing anybody.

546
00:43:46,465 --> 00:43:50,196
You wanted to sue me? You did.
D'you want my blood now?

547
00:43:50,269 --> 00:43:52,294
Look at the victim.
You're a bastard!

548
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:55,636
Don't insult me.
And leave the boy out of this.

549
00:43:55,707 --> 00:43:58,107
He is not staying out.
You explain it to him.

550
00:43:59,444 --> 00:44:01,071
- How are you?
- What's up, boy?

551
00:44:01,146 --> 00:44:02,636
- Fine?
- How are you?

552
00:44:02,714 --> 00:44:05,182
Didn't you say he never came,
he didn't care? How are you?

553
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,878
- Fine. And you?
- Okay.

554
00:44:07,953 --> 00:44:12,049
Finally your sister got to have you
working with her all dressed up.

555
00:44:12,124 --> 00:44:15,560
Yes, we need the money.
We still have debts.

556
00:44:15,627 --> 00:44:18,460
You don't have to explain.
You shouldn't feel ashamed.

557
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,192
Explain to him why he can't
collect his grandparents' money.

558
00:44:21,266 --> 00:44:23,564
- Valeria, cut it out.
- Yes.

559
00:44:23,635 --> 00:44:27,366
- Don't be naive, Federico.
- Don't involve me in this mess.

560
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,830
He's already explained what
happened with the inheritance.

561
00:44:29,908 --> 00:44:32,638
- You believe him?
- Of course, he's my brother.

562
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,736
Do what you have to do,
sue him. I don't care.

563
00:44:34,813 --> 00:44:36,508
But don't bust my balls.

564
00:44:37,816 --> 00:44:41,343
- I have to go back to work. See you.
- Okay.

565
00:44:46,992 --> 00:44:48,391
Bye.

566
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,932
- Good afternoon.
- What d'you want?

567
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:08,034
Your husband sent us to pick
up an envelope he left for us.

568
00:45:08,113 --> 00:45:10,604
It's a yellow,
large envelope on the shelf...

569
00:45:10,682 --> 00:45:13,480
in the living room
under the Chinese jar.

570
00:45:13,552 --> 00:45:15,543
- My husband is not in.
- Yes, I know.

571
00:45:15,621 --> 00:45:17,418
He said that
even if he wasn't home...

572
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:19,252
we could come by
to pick up the envelope.

573
00:45:19,324 --> 00:45:22,816
He's not in!
Come back later.

574
00:45:22,894 --> 00:45:25,124
We'd love to, but we can't.

575
00:45:25,197 --> 00:45:28,758
- Sandler, Mr. Sandler said that...
- He's not in!

576
00:45:28,834 --> 00:45:33,294
He's not in!
My husband is not in!

577
00:45:33,905 --> 00:45:37,136
Who are you?
What do you want from me?

578
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:41,976
- Nothing, it's just...
- Go away or I'll call the police.

579
00:45:42,047 --> 00:45:44,982
- Madam, please...
- Go away!

580
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:50,613
I know your kind. You take
advantage of old ladies like me.

581
00:45:50,689 --> 00:45:52,179
But I won't allow it.

582
00:45:52,257 --> 00:45:55,124
That's why I don't open
my door to anyone.

583
00:45:55,193 --> 00:45:57,184
Let's go, the lady's right.
There's no point.

584
00:45:57,262 --> 00:45:59,287
Your mother will understand.
It's not that bad.

585
00:45:59,364 --> 00:46:01,855
If we ever visit her again,
we'll take her the photos...

586
00:46:01,933 --> 00:46:04,026
otherwise we won't.

587
00:46:04,102 --> 00:46:08,471
Bye.
Forgive us, madam.

588
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,703
My brother gets all worked up
when he's going to visit mother.

589
00:46:11,777 --> 00:46:14,245
And she was looking forward
to seeing these photos...

590
00:46:14,613 --> 00:46:16,274
but never mind.

591
00:46:16,348 --> 00:46:18,316
We'll fix it somehow.
Goodbye.

592
00:46:23,889 --> 00:46:25,720
Listen...

593
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:31,621
No, not you. You stay there.
Come here.

594
00:46:36,802 --> 00:46:37,632
Yes?

595
00:46:37,703 --> 00:46:40,866
In that envelope there
are photos for your Mum?

596
00:46:40,939 --> 00:46:43,635
Some old photos of my Uncle Liver
and his family in Poland.

597
00:46:44,443 --> 00:46:47,708
Your husband promised us
some copies of the originals.

598
00:46:47,779 --> 00:46:51,044
We wanted to give them to
Mum now that we'll visit her.

599
00:46:51,383 --> 00:46:54,045
- Where does your mother live?
- In Entre Ríos.

600
00:46:55,987 --> 00:46:57,579
Entre Ríos!

601
00:46:57,656 --> 00:47:01,854
Entre Ríos.
Would you wait a minute?

602
00:47:05,897 --> 00:47:07,956
- Okay, twenty percent.
- 50-50.

603
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,864
No fucking way, I'd kill you first.
Twenty-five percent.

604
00:47:09,935 --> 00:47:11,425
You can't do it without me.

605
00:47:11,503 --> 00:47:14,495
I'm not Sandler and
you really need the dough.

606
00:47:14,573 --> 00:47:17,701
Thirty percent.
That's it, minus expenses.

607
00:47:22,647 --> 00:47:27,016
Do you know Entre Ríos?
Mom would never leave there.

608
00:47:27,085 --> 00:47:28,484
She always says...

609
00:47:28,553 --> 00:47:31,386
"A Meckler stays in the land
where he was born."

610
00:47:31,456 --> 00:47:32,718
Meckler?

611
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:35,885
Is she related to Rabbi Meckler,
of Basavilbaso?

612
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:38,862
Her cousin.
I'm his nephew.

613
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:49,905
Vidal Gandolfo will be at the hotel
the whole afternoon.

614
00:47:51,543 --> 00:47:55,673
- They ordered drinks for 3:30p.m.
- How will you approach him?

615
00:47:58,383 --> 00:48:00,248
I don't know.

616
00:48:01,586 --> 00:48:04,077
- We must think of something.
- Think fast.

617
00:48:04,156 --> 00:48:06,522
He's leaving tomorrow.
You don't have much time.

618
00:48:06,591 --> 00:48:10,493
We, I mean, you could
contribute 30% of an idea.

619
00:48:10,562 --> 00:48:13,429
How are you, dear Marcos?

620
00:48:13,565 --> 00:48:17,001
I'm sorry, Washington.
We're busy.

621
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:20,333
It'll take you longer to dismiss
me than to check my goods.

622
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:24,607
You're right.
What do you have?

623
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,605
Whatever you want.

624
00:48:29,347 --> 00:48:32,077
National, Buenos Aires,
Córdoba, Cooperative...

625
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:33,811
- Third parties?
- And blank checks.

626
00:48:33,885 --> 00:48:35,853
I have some
complete check books.

627
00:48:36,822 --> 00:48:40,724
- I want for you to leave.
- Don't you wanna make a gift?

628
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,589
You could impress your loved ones.

629
00:48:42,661 --> 00:48:46,597
Nothing better than
a Paraguayan Rolex to do that.

630
00:48:46,665 --> 00:48:50,362
And you, young man?
Anything else?

631
00:48:50,502 --> 00:48:53,562
Perfumes, clothing, imported sneakers?

632
00:48:54,005 --> 00:48:58,305
Computer software, paintings,
electronic devices?

633
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:02,273
I have an excellentJapanese
bike, with minor damages.

634
00:49:02,347 --> 00:49:04,042
- What damages?
- A hole in the tank.

635
00:49:04,115 --> 00:49:07,209
- A perforation?
- Small caliber.

636
00:49:07,285 --> 00:49:09,719
That's it, I need a gun
but something large.

637
00:49:09,788 --> 00:49:11,278
D'you have a .3 57?

638
00:49:12,123 --> 00:49:13,750
Marcos...

639
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:16,225
I'm not a crook.

640
00:49:18,363 --> 00:49:19,990
Have a nice day.

641
00:49:22,067 --> 00:49:25,059
Excuse me,
do you have cell phones?

642
00:49:25,637 --> 00:49:27,070
Any make in particular?

643
00:49:29,307 --> 00:49:30,740
An idea?

644
00:49:43,755 --> 00:49:46,383
Easy, he'll go.

645
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,238
Hello...

646
00:50:37,842 --> 00:50:40,208
Yes, it's me.

647
00:50:40,278 --> 00:50:44,874
What's up? It's not a good time.
I'm about to take a leak.

648
00:50:45,517 --> 00:50:47,747
At the hotel.

649
00:50:47,953 --> 00:50:50,114
I came because
I was given a tip...

650
00:50:50,188 --> 00:50:52,486
but I doubt it'll work out.

651
00:50:53,858 --> 00:50:57,089
No, no, I'm going
to Montevideo on Saturday.

652
00:50:57,162 --> 00:51:01,064
I'll try to sell them there. Yes.

653
00:51:03,034 --> 00:51:06,970
The thing is not when but how much.

654
00:51:09,007 --> 00:51:12,875
Are you crazy?
For the "Nine Queens"?

655
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,713
I tell you what.

656
00:51:16,781 --> 00:51:19,306
For that amount go
to the post office and...

657
00:51:19,384 --> 00:51:21,147
get as many stamps as you like.

658
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:23,244
Not even close.
Forget it.

659
00:51:28,093 --> 00:51:30,653
Now, that's better.

660
00:51:33,732 --> 00:51:36,565
- What the fuck are you doing here?!
- Talking on the phone.

661
00:51:36,768 --> 00:51:39,396
Don't fuck with me!

662
00:51:40,238 --> 00:51:42,297
It's the second time today
I see you around.

663
00:51:42,374 --> 00:51:43,898
You and that prick.

664
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,499
What d'you want?

665
00:51:45,577 --> 00:51:48,307
I do the asking, you just answer.
What're you doing here?

666
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,247
- What's the trick this time?
- I have something to sell.

667
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:54,251
- It's legal, no strings attached.
- In the hotel restroom?

668
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,015
Don't fuck with me!
D'you want me to get really mad?

669
00:51:58,223 --> 00:52:02,819
We're all here now.
Look at the face of this guy.

670
00:52:02,894 --> 00:52:04,987
Where did you find him?

671
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:07,730
The people at the hotel
are worried.

672
00:52:07,799 --> 00:52:09,824
Come and explain everything to me.

673
00:52:09,901 --> 00:52:11,698
That won't be necessary.

674
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:15,137
I'm sure you won't mind
showing me your I D.

675
00:52:19,077 --> 00:52:21,637
- Put the gun down.
- And who are you?

676
00:52:22,547 --> 00:52:24,037
A guest at the hotel.

677
00:52:24,115 --> 00:52:26,083
These gentlemen
are here because...

678
00:52:26,151 --> 00:52:27,880
- I called them.
- You called them?

679
00:52:30,388 --> 00:52:32,618
Please, put the gun away.

680
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:37,560
You might be a guest here,
the king of Spain, but I don't

681
00:52:39,064 --> 00:52:42,363
You come with me.
And you, wait for me.

682
00:52:50,408 --> 00:52:55,209
- You bastard!
- You liked it! You liked it!

683
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,441
Fucking asshole!
Who said you had to hit me?

684
00:52:57,515 --> 00:53:00,279
I should go to Hollywood.
He bought it!

685
00:53:00,485 --> 00:53:04,785
- I should do this for a living.
- We must go back.

686
00:53:04,856 --> 00:53:07,450
Take whatever he gives you
and consider yourself paid.

687
00:53:07,525 --> 00:53:10,983
No, you have to give me
your part. You owe me 200.

688
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:13,792
- I'll give you a hundred now...
- Two hundred.

689
00:53:28,613 --> 00:53:30,513
My pleasure.

690
00:53:32,183 --> 00:53:34,811
I'd like to have a word
with you. Follow me.

691
00:53:34,886 --> 00:53:37,650
My partners are waiting for me.

692
00:53:38,656 --> 00:53:40,351
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

693
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,518
Where did your friend get the I D?

694
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,188
He gets it at his job,
together with the gun.

695
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:57,776
Let's not waste time.

696
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,505
Let's not waste time.

697
00:53:59,878 --> 00:54:02,938
You told the cop
you have something to sell.

698
00:54:03,014 --> 00:54:06,142
A legal deal, as you said.

699
00:54:07,152 --> 00:54:09,848
And from what I heard of
your phone conversation...

700
00:54:09,888 --> 00:54:13,016
- I might be interested.
- Who are you?

701
00:54:13,191 --> 00:54:15,682
If what you have to offer
is what I believe it is...

702
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,318
Excuse me.
Who are you?

703
00:54:17,395 --> 00:54:20,421
The person you were tipped off
about. The one you came to see.

704
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:24,196
I've nothing to sell
nor did I ask any favor.

705
00:54:24,269 --> 00:54:25,827
We're here to be polite.

706
00:54:25,904 --> 00:54:29,237
You helped us out in the
restroom, a misunderstanding.

707
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,366
But the truth is
I don't know who you are.

708
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:34,707
- What d'you say?
- My partner speaks for me too.

709
00:54:35,113 --> 00:54:41,052
Professionals. D'you see, idiots,
how these things are handled?

710
00:54:41,219 --> 00:54:44,916
If you had something to sell to
me you'd knock on my door...

711
00:54:44,989 --> 00:54:47,753
...just like a book peddler.

712
00:54:49,394 --> 00:54:52,090
But if you were a smart Argentinian...

713
00:54:53,097 --> 00:54:55,531
...you'd try to interest me.

714
00:54:56,267 --> 00:54:58,735
You'd find a way
to have me look for you...

715
00:54:58,803 --> 00:55:00,794
and not the other way round.

716
00:55:01,139 --> 00:55:04,074
You could, for example, have
a telephone conversation...

717
00:55:04,142 --> 00:55:09,239
with an alleged buyer
and make sure I'd listen to it.

718
00:55:09,948 --> 00:55:12,883
But you have to be subtle.

719
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,050
You shouldn't say anything like...

720
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:20,079
"What? For the Nine Queens?
You are crazy! "

721
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:24,889
And then the cop, "Please,
don't hit me. I've something to sell.

722
00:55:24,963 --> 00:55:30,299
But it's legal. I promise."
Do you understand?

723
00:55:30,635 --> 00:55:32,535
It was so ridiculous!

724
00:55:37,475 --> 00:55:40,205
I don't know
what you are talking about.

725
00:55:40,278 --> 00:55:43,076
Look, man. There's no point
in insisting on that.

726
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:48,414
It is true that if you had
approached me directly...

727
00:55:48,486 --> 00:55:50,784
I would've never talked with you.

728
00:55:50,855 --> 00:55:54,052
I don't care
that you did it this way.

729
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:56,389
As long as what you have
is good and interests me.

730
00:55:56,928 --> 00:55:59,123
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

731
00:55:59,197 --> 00:56:01,859
Man, cut it out!
The show is over!

732
00:56:01,933 --> 00:56:03,992
You're here
and I'm listening.

733
00:56:04,068 --> 00:56:07,435
If you have something
to offer me, do it or fuck off.

734
00:56:07,505 --> 00:56:09,871
I have little time left and much to do.

735
00:56:30,461 --> 00:56:32,292
Do you have this?

736
00:56:33,898 --> 00:56:35,889
And where did you get it?

737
00:56:35,967 --> 00:56:38,731
My grandfather gave them
to me shortly before he died...

738
00:56:38,803 --> 00:56:40,293
a few months ago.

739
00:56:40,371 --> 00:56:42,839
He got them from a German
guy he met on a ship.

740
00:56:42,907 --> 00:56:46,172
- He paid seven pesos for them.
- Seven pesos...

741
00:56:46,244 --> 00:56:50,237
I told my cousin. He suggested
I should sell them to a collector.

742
00:56:50,315 --> 00:56:52,840
- Are you interested?
- Don't push me.

743
00:56:52,917 --> 00:56:55,647
I mean, as you have
so little time left and so much to do...

744
00:56:57,689 --> 00:56:59,680
I might want to buy them.

745
00:57:01,225 --> 00:57:06,253
- That would be good, for all of us.
- Come back, in an hour.

746
00:57:06,497 --> 00:57:08,863
I want to see the stamps
and then we'll talk about money.

747
00:57:08,933 --> 00:57:11,959
- Today.
- Today, yes.

748
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:13,970
I don't have much time.

749
00:57:14,038 --> 00:57:17,633
Unfortunately, I have to leave
your city tomorrow morning.

750
00:57:18,676 --> 00:57:21,406
- You didn't know that?
- I didn't know.

751
00:57:21,546 --> 00:57:25,880
That's the way it is.
And believe me, I'll miss this country.

752
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:29,613
I've never seen such good will
for doing business.

753
00:57:30,455 --> 00:57:32,286
In my room, at 4 o'clock.

754
00:57:36,728 --> 00:57:39,390
Let go of that phone!
Goddamit!

755
00:57:49,741 --> 00:57:51,902
I told you not to fuck
around in the hotel.

756
00:57:51,976 --> 00:57:54,774
- Don't worry.
- Stay out of this.

757
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,507
Really, it has nothing to do...

758
00:57:56,581 --> 00:57:58,105
What is it with you, asshole?

759
00:57:58,182 --> 00:58:00,173
D'you know how
my brother's partners end up?

760
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:02,082
You believe you'll
get money out of him?

761
00:58:02,153 --> 00:58:03,984
- Don't come back.
- We'll be back.

762
00:58:04,055 --> 00:58:06,956
- I'll call the police.
- Call them. What will you say?

763
00:58:16,501 --> 00:58:18,059
Excuse me.

764
00:58:18,136 --> 00:58:20,195
By any chance,
do you remember a song...

765
00:58:20,271 --> 00:58:22,933
by Rita Pavone,
"II Ballo del Mattone"?

766
00:58:31,749 --> 00:58:34,684
Come on... let's go.

767
00:58:38,589 --> 00:58:42,355
- What did your sister mean?
- About what?

768
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,921
- How your partners end up.
- How could I know?

769
00:58:45,863 --> 00:58:48,764
- Why did you stop working with Sandler?
- It's not your business.

770
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:52,234
For this day, I'm your partner.
It's my business.

771
00:58:53,004 --> 00:58:57,338
Technically we could say
I unilaterally readjusted dividends.

772
00:58:57,642 --> 00:59:00,975
- You fucked your partner.
- "You fucked your partner."

773
00:59:01,479 --> 00:59:03,470
Sandler was always an asshole.

774
00:59:03,548 --> 00:59:06,176
It couldn't have been that bad
if he called me again.

775
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,184
Don't worry. I won't fuck you.

776
00:59:08,252 --> 00:59:09,412
Why not?

777
00:59:09,487 --> 00:59:11,546
I'm getting old,
I'm sure you run faster than I do.

778
00:59:11,622 --> 00:59:14,614
- I'm not convinced.
- Doesn't bother me.

779
00:59:28,706 --> 00:59:31,174
No, goddamit, no.

780
00:59:35,213 --> 00:59:39,115
Because I won't maintain
an unfavorable position.

781
00:59:43,154 --> 00:59:45,054
How much?

782
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,349
That's better.

783
00:59:48,426 --> 00:59:52,226
Offer an option at 1 9,000
and freeze.

784
00:59:55,566 --> 01:00:00,196
Yes, we'd only be losing...
Let me see...

785
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,876
...two and a half,
three million.

786
01:00:09,547 --> 01:00:11,378
That's better.

787
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,947
I'll call you later.

788
01:00:22,593 --> 01:00:24,117
Alright.

789
01:00:33,638 --> 01:00:34,627
Give me that.

790
01:00:56,661 --> 01:00:57,650
Do your stuff.

791
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:02,894
Mr. Vidal, I must insist.
These are not the right conditions.

792
01:01:02,967 --> 01:01:07,131
We should run lab tests
on the ink and a spectography.

793
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,196
I don't have time, goddamit!

794
01:01:09,273 --> 01:01:12,936
You're supposed to be the best,
at least I'm paying you as if you were.

795
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:17,580
Cut it out and tell me
if they're good or not.

796
01:01:17,648 --> 01:01:20,412
Should I pay for them
or is someone with a lot of guts...

797
01:01:20,484 --> 01:01:21,712
trying to screw me?

798
01:01:26,123 --> 01:01:30,560
Go ahead, do whatever is necessary.
The stamps are good.

799
01:02:27,685 --> 01:02:30,119
Excuse me, do any of you
remember a song by...

800
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:45,966
How's the game going?

801
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:12,620
A sheet of stamps
of the Weimar Republic...

802
01:03:12,697 --> 01:03:14,688
with a rare distribution of the edges.

803
01:03:15,266 --> 01:03:16,528
You're right, Mr. Vidal.

804
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,865
No more tests are necessary.
These are the Nine Queens.

805
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:27,573
You, pay him.

806
01:03:31,282 --> 01:03:34,149
Let's talk about money.

807
01:03:37,054 --> 01:03:41,616
- What I had thought...
- Don't think. You just listen.

808
01:03:41,792 --> 01:03:44,886
I don't know what you do
for a living and I don't care.

809
01:03:44,962 --> 01:03:47,760
One thing is for sure,
you don't sell stamps for a living.

810
01:03:47,832 --> 01:03:50,130
These stamps
were dropped on your lap...

811
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,567
and whatever you get for them
is like a gift from heaven.

812
01:03:52,636 --> 01:03:57,596
- Am I wrong?
- No, it's true.

813
01:03:58,309 --> 01:04:01,107
We don't know much about stamps.

814
01:04:01,612 --> 01:04:03,170
Nevertheless...

815
01:04:03,247 --> 01:04:07,274
we'd rather sell them here,
now, without any further delays.

816
01:04:07,351 --> 01:04:10,946
But I could also get financing
or go to the States.

817
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:15,151
I can auction them.
I mean, we won't give them away.

818
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:18,684
- Lf we check the catalogues...
- Fuck the catalogues!

819
01:04:18,763 --> 01:04:22,255
What is it? You've turned
into an expert all of a sudden?

820
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:27,464
It's me who's gonna buy those stamps.
The rest is bullshit.

821
01:04:27,538 --> 01:04:29,267
I tell you the price and you accept it.

822
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:37,710
I won't give you a cent more than...

823
01:04:38,783 --> 01:04:41,616
three hundred thousand.

824
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:50,360
This is not what we had agreed.
I will not be robbed.

825
01:04:50,494 --> 01:04:53,986
My grandfather kept
these stamps all his life...

826
01:04:54,064 --> 01:04:56,658
and I won't give them away
to the first one who comes along.

827
01:04:56,734 --> 01:04:57,723
Listen...

828
01:04:57,802 --> 01:05:00,930
You listen. We have
an agreement, but I decide.

829
01:05:01,005 --> 01:05:02,996
I won't blow them and that's final.

830
01:05:03,073 --> 01:05:04,734
Well, well, well...

831
01:05:04,809 --> 01:05:07,778
What amount would
please your grandfather?

832
01:05:25,863 --> 01:05:28,525
- Four hundred and fifty grand.
- What?

833
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:31,397
This guy is going
to buy the stamps from us.

834
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:35,735
We deliver them at ten and
he'll pay us $450,000.

835
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:40,477
Ten percent for Sandler,
and thirty percent of the balance is mine.

836
01:05:40,544 --> 01:05:44,105
- Minus expenses.
- Where's the trick?

837
01:05:44,515 --> 01:05:47,882
- What?
- You're screwing me.

838
01:05:47,952 --> 01:05:49,647
This is a trick.
You're pulling a trick.

839
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,450
- You think I'm screwing you? How?
- I don't know.

840
01:05:52,523 --> 01:05:56,823
I can't understand it
and it makes me mad.

841
01:05:56,894 --> 01:06:01,194
- This is not real.
- It's not real? Give me that.

842
01:06:01,265 --> 01:06:04,928
This is as real as it gets,
asshole. It's 450 grand.

843
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:08,460
It's more real than you and I.
What is it, kid?

844
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:13,075
Something keeps you from enjoying life?
Do you need assurances?

845
01:06:13,143 --> 01:06:19,673
Look, you can be sure I'll kill you
if I lose this deal because of you.

846
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:23,743
Does it look suspicious?
Okay. You're out. That's it.

847
01:06:23,821 --> 01:06:26,449
Get out.
Leave me alone. Bye.

848
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,719
Get out, come on.

849
01:06:29,093 --> 01:06:32,585
Have a good life.
Why would I need you?

850
01:06:42,706 --> 01:06:46,369
- I should get rid of you now.
- You are starting to love me.

851
01:06:48,245 --> 01:06:49,974
What do you want?

852
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,983
How did it go?

853
01:06:54,084 --> 01:06:57,076
- How did what go? What do you want?
- Did he buy them?

854
01:06:57,821 --> 01:07:00,119
- What is he talking about?
- I don't know.

855
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:02,988
- What do you want?
- My cut. What you owe me.

856
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,995
What the fuck are you talking about?

857
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:10,298
Look, you know very well
those stamps are worth nothing.

858
01:07:10,367 --> 01:07:14,064
The originals, yes,
but what you're trying to sell to Vidal...

859
01:07:14,138 --> 01:07:16,902
They are not bad.
They are well done.

860
01:07:16,974 --> 01:07:19,340
- You want your cut?
- Yes.

861
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:20,934
How much?

862
01:07:21,011 --> 01:07:25,539
- Well... 1 5%. I rendered a service to you.
- I didn't ask for it.

863
01:07:25,616 --> 01:07:27,743
I'll tell him.
I'll go and tell them they're fake.

864
01:07:27,818 --> 01:07:30,446
If you tell him,
I'll pull your liver out of your ass...

865
01:07:30,521 --> 01:07:32,921
and make you swallow it.

866
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:34,753
Who d'you think you're talking to?

867
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:37,720
- 1 0%.
- 2%.

868
01:07:37,795 --> 01:07:40,127
- 7.5%.
- 5%. Alright?

869
01:07:40,197 --> 01:07:42,256
- Alright?
- Yes.

870
01:07:43,767 --> 01:07:45,928
Give me an address
and a phone number.

871
01:07:46,003 --> 01:07:48,198
- I'll get in touch with you.
- How do I know you'll call?

872
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:49,569
D'you want me to sign an IOU?

873
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,666
Among thieves, this is the way
it's done. It's based on trust.

874
01:07:52,743 --> 01:07:54,506
I'm no thief.

875
01:07:54,578 --> 01:07:56,978
Sure. I'm sorry.
Come on.

876
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:00,815
- I'm at this number in the mornings.
- At what time?

877
01:08:00,884 --> 01:08:05,514
- Eight to eleven. Except Wednesdays.
- Go. I'll call you.

878
01:08:07,524 --> 01:08:13,087
Goddamit! Is it this way everywhere?
We are fucked.

879
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:16,092
You are handing out too many shares.

880
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:19,397
I mean, 1 0% for one guy,
5% for another...

881
01:08:23,374 --> 01:08:24,739
No!

882
01:09:39,917 --> 01:09:41,908
What a mess.

883
01:09:42,252 --> 01:09:43,913
It lasted...

884
01:09:45,489 --> 01:09:47,354
four hours.

885
01:09:47,424 --> 01:09:50,018
- Dreams don't last that long.
- It wasn't a dream.

886
01:09:50,094 --> 01:09:53,655
- It is now.
- What is it? Everyday you lose a fortune?

887
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:56,962
No, but... there's nothing
we can do, it's over.

888
01:09:57,034 --> 01:09:59,525
These stamps are fucked up,
the others...

889
01:10:03,807 --> 01:10:07,243
- What is it?
- The others, the originals...

890
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:10,706
Sandler's sister has them
at the Kavanagh.

891
01:10:10,781 --> 01:10:14,182
- Yes, but Sandler said...
- Sandler's an asshole.

892
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:16,809
We offer her a share.

893
01:10:16,887 --> 01:10:18,650
We tell them they are already sold...

894
01:10:18,722 --> 01:10:20,986
...and that we only need
to deliver them and collect.

895
01:10:21,058 --> 01:10:23,652
- And if she doesn't want to?
- She'll want.

896
01:10:24,161 --> 01:10:25,753
The old bag will do it.

897
01:10:25,829 --> 01:10:28,389
If not, you can do
your crone seducer part. Come.

898
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,899
So...

899
01:10:34,838 --> 01:10:36,806
the Nine Queens.

900
01:10:36,874 --> 01:10:38,603
Exactly.

901
01:10:40,544 --> 01:10:42,842
And what did my brother tell you?

902
01:10:42,913 --> 01:10:48,783
He suggested that you were
very fond of the collection...

903
01:10:48,852 --> 01:10:51,946
and that it was a memory to you.

904
01:10:52,022 --> 01:10:54,286
Of my husband, of course.

905
01:10:54,358 --> 01:10:58,124
It's true. The stamps
remind me of my husband.

906
01:10:58,195 --> 01:11:01,926
Square, sticky.

907
01:11:02,432 --> 01:11:06,698
Anyway, we dared to come
because we thought that...

908
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:09,796
the possibility
of an immediate operation

909
01:11:09,873 --> 01:11:15,004
My brother thinks
I'd never sell those fucking stamps?

910
01:11:15,078 --> 01:11:17,137
What an asshole!
I wouldn't give them to him.

911
01:11:17,214 --> 01:11:21,844
It doesn't mean I wouldn't sell them
if I needed the money.

912
01:11:36,533 --> 01:11:40,833
I've been thinking of turning
them into something useful.

913
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,468
I'm running expenses...

914
01:11:46,977 --> 01:11:49,639
- Your commission is... ?
- 1 5%.

915
01:11:49,713 --> 01:11:52,238
We would do the operation today.

916
01:11:52,916 --> 01:11:56,477
How convenient.
What is the price?

917
01:11:56,553 --> 01:11:58,544
Fifty thousand, cash.

918
01:12:14,504 --> 01:12:16,938
Who do you take me for, stooge?

919
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:21,033
- Excuse me, honestly I don't...
- Cut the acting with me.

920
01:12:21,111 --> 01:12:24,137
You think I don't know
those stamps are valuable?

921
01:12:24,915 --> 01:12:28,214
What's your line of work,
swindling old ladies?

922
01:12:28,285 --> 01:12:31,618
I don't know the exact value,
and I don't care.

923
01:12:32,155 --> 01:12:35,454
Let me explain it to you.
I set a price that makes me happy.

924
01:12:35,525 --> 01:12:39,359
Whoever wants the stamps
gives me that amount...

925
01:12:39,429 --> 01:12:41,420
and he can take them.

926
01:12:41,498 --> 01:12:42,624
That's all.

927
01:12:42,699 --> 01:12:46,362
No percentages,
no down payments, no consignments.

928
01:12:46,436 --> 01:12:49,064
Whoever wants them,
pays for them and takes them.

929
01:12:50,274 --> 01:12:52,640
And what is the figure to get happiness?

930
01:12:53,677 --> 01:12:55,668
He speaks...

931
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:58,371
- Beautiful virtue.
- How much?

932
01:13:01,485 --> 01:13:04,579
Let's say... 500,000 dollars.

933
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:08,389
Sit down.

934
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:17,089
Look...

935
01:13:18,035 --> 01:13:20,333
That amount is too high.

936
01:13:20,971 --> 01:13:23,098
- The stamps are not worth that much.
- No?

937
01:13:23,173 --> 01:13:27,007
No. Listen...

938
01:13:28,412 --> 01:13:32,849
- I think we could reach 7 5,000.
- No way.

939
01:13:32,916 --> 01:13:34,975
- 450.
- 1 00,000.

940
01:13:35,052 --> 01:13:38,613
- 400.
- 1 50.

941
01:13:38,689 --> 01:13:42,216
- We should go.
- 3 50,000.

942
01:13:42,859 --> 01:13:44,952
- 200,000 perhaps.
- Let's go now.

943
01:13:46,263 --> 01:13:49,858
250,000 dollars.
That's final.

944
01:13:52,903 --> 01:13:55,701
If we were to bring the money today...

945
01:13:55,772 --> 01:13:58,366
would the stamps be available?

946
01:13:58,542 --> 01:13:59,804
Sure.

947
01:13:59,876 --> 01:14:03,243
- You have them here?
- That's none of your business.

948
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:05,645
If you pay today,
you have them today.

949
01:14:21,865 --> 01:14:24,834
- What is it?
- We are fucked, aren't we? This is it.

950
01:14:24,901 --> 01:14:27,995
We must go on. It'd be crazy to let go.
We must go on.

951
01:14:28,071 --> 01:14:30,631
- What d'you mean?
- Buying the stamps from the old bitch.

952
01:14:30,707 --> 01:14:36,202
- Are you nuts?
- No, she wants 250 grand.

953
01:14:36,279 --> 01:14:38,474
They are sold for 450 grand.

954
01:14:38,548 --> 01:14:41,176
One day of work,
200 grand profit.

955
01:14:41,251 --> 01:14:43,913
Where are you going to get 250 grand?

956
01:14:45,756 --> 01:14:49,590
I have some money.
I could use it.

957
01:14:50,494 --> 01:14:53,190
- 250 grand.
- No, less.

958
01:14:54,131 --> 01:14:58,033
Ah, your sister's... that thing.

959
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:00,495
I saw an opportunity
and I grabbed it.

960
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:02,561
I was swifter than she was, that's all.

961
01:15:02,639 --> 01:15:05,437
- Otherwise she would've done it to you.
- No doubt.

962
01:15:05,742 --> 01:15:08,336
I planned not to use it
for a year or so until...

963
01:15:08,412 --> 01:15:11,381
the whole thing calmed down,
the lawsuit forgotten.

964
01:15:11,581 --> 01:15:13,845
Then we are saved.

965
01:15:13,917 --> 01:15:18,786
We buy, we sell,
200 grand profit like you say.

966
01:15:18,855 --> 01:15:20,846
30% for me without risking a cent.

967
01:15:20,924 --> 01:15:22,858
But I don't have all the money.

968
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,850
I have...

969
01:15:24,928 --> 01:15:29,024
the inheritance plus something
I can get from the lawyer...

970
01:15:29,332 --> 01:15:33,325
plus my money totals...

971
01:15:34,104 --> 01:15:35,799
200 grand.

972
01:15:37,374 --> 01:15:39,467
Where will we get the rest?

973
01:15:42,712 --> 01:15:46,478
- Well, you have 50 grand for your old man...
- You said it.

974
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:48,541
- You are a bastard!
- Stop it!

975
01:15:48,618 --> 01:15:50,677
Son of a bitch!
D'you think I'm an asshole?

976
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:53,484
That I'll give you 50 grand,
everything I have for my dad...

977
01:15:53,557 --> 01:15:55,684
that I'll give it to you?

978
01:15:55,759 --> 01:15:58,057
For you to do business! Fuck off!

979
01:15:58,128 --> 01:16:00,926
You're nuts!
I wouldn't try to fuck you with money.

980
01:16:00,997 --> 01:16:03,659
Would I show you the way
I do business, how I work?

981
01:16:03,733 --> 01:16:07,430
- What kind of an idiot would that make me?
- A smart one.

982
01:16:07,504 --> 01:16:11,133
You arranged it with the old girl?
What does she get, 30%?

983
01:16:11,208 --> 01:16:14,041
How much does Sandler get,
less? 1 5%, 20%?

984
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:16,102
- How much d'you give him?
- You're an idiot.

985
01:16:16,179 --> 01:16:18,170
You have an opportunity
and you can't see it.

986
01:16:18,281 --> 01:16:20,272
You have 200 grand!

987
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:22,841
I have 50!
The lady wants 250!

988
01:16:22,919 --> 01:16:27,447
- Fuck you!
- Exactly, shithead. Listen. Listen.

989
01:16:27,524 --> 01:16:30,584
Nobody could invent something
like this unless it's true.

990
01:16:32,395 --> 01:16:34,625
These things happen, man.

991
01:16:34,698 --> 01:16:38,034
It's a one in a million chance.
Once in a lifetime.

992
01:16:38,034 --> 01:16:42,437
It's happening to you and me,
here and now. One in a million.

993
01:16:45,308 --> 01:16:47,367
Fuck you, asshole!

994
01:16:47,444 --> 01:16:50,743
I'll give you 50%,
whatever amount you contribute.

995
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:52,111
Fucking hell!

996
01:17:29,352 --> 01:17:29,786
Thanks for the cigars.
You didn't forget my favorite.

997
01:17:29,786 --> 01:17:32,755
Thanks for the cigars.
You didn't forget my favorite.

998
01:17:59,683 --> 01:18:01,776
- How are you?
- Fine.

999
01:18:02,886 --> 01:18:05,582
Although I think I'd be better at home.

1000
01:18:08,358 --> 01:18:10,918
This place is full of crooks.

1001
01:18:11,628 --> 01:18:14,324
- What about the money?
- Tough.

1002
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:17,162
I no longer have two or three months.

1003
01:18:17,834 --> 01:18:20,962
- What happened?
- Vizcardi will be inhibited...

1004
01:18:21,037 --> 01:18:23,528
an issue of venues.

1005
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,165
The case will be drawn again
and anyone could be the judge.

1006
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,438
Not anyone accepts a bribe.

1007
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:32,738
If I don't get the money
in ten days...

1008
01:18:33,516 --> 01:18:35,575
I lose the train.

1009
01:18:35,652 --> 01:18:37,449
Only ten days?

1010
01:18:39,189 --> 01:18:43,717
Ten days... three months...
What difference does it make?

1011
01:18:44,961 --> 01:18:47,589
Where am I going to get 7 0,000?

1012
01:18:48,798 --> 01:18:51,699
You can't stay here, Dad.

1013
01:18:52,068 --> 01:18:54,127
- I could...
- Don't even think about it.

1014
01:19:04,881 --> 01:19:06,473
Am I losing it?

1015
01:19:09,486 --> 01:19:11,920
- Why?
- Why, what?

1016
01:19:11,988 --> 01:19:15,981
- Why can't I try to help you?
- Not the way you're thinking.

1017
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:19,558
- Listen...
- No, you listen.

1018
01:19:19,629 --> 01:19:21,688
I told you a thousand times.

1019
01:19:21,765 --> 01:19:24,962
I've already made those mistakes.
Don't you do it again.

1020
01:19:26,403 --> 01:19:28,337
Do you think it's a game?

1021
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:32,040
Do you think the guys
who do this are easy?

1022
01:19:32,942 --> 01:19:37,777
I got fucked a thousand times,
and you didn't see what I saw.

1023
01:19:38,882 --> 01:19:42,340
I mean it, don't be stupid.

1024
01:19:43,453 --> 01:19:45,648
Don't do anything that could land you here.

1025
01:20:06,276 --> 01:20:08,369
You wouldn't survive.

1026
01:22:01,758 --> 01:22:03,851
What must I do for you to understand?

1027
01:22:03,927 --> 01:22:08,330
If you give me a hard time,
it'll take me longer to finish my business.

1028
01:22:08,398 --> 01:22:10,525
That's it.
I'll call the police.

1029
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,592
I don't know what I'll say,
but you won't stay in my hotel.

1030
01:22:14,037 --> 01:22:15,470
Your hotel?

1031
01:22:15,538 --> 01:22:18,371
Is this your hotel?
You'll call the police?

1032
01:22:18,441 --> 01:22:20,466
Wasn't it enough
to bust my balls all my life...

1033
01:22:20,543 --> 01:22:22,408
taking Mom's place
as soon as she died...

1034
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:24,140
and now you want
to fuck me with this?

1035
01:22:24,214 --> 01:22:27,547
I'm only going to say it once. Once.

1036
01:22:27,617 --> 01:22:30,643
I'm not fucking around in your hotel.

1037
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:34,486
My hard luck is that the guy
is staying here. That's it.

1038
01:22:34,557 --> 01:22:36,320
If you interfere in any way...

1039
01:22:36,392 --> 01:22:39,850
lf, because of you, this falls
through, I promise I'll kill you.

1040
01:22:39,929 --> 01:22:42,625
- You don't kill people.
- You don't know me.

1041
01:22:45,869 --> 01:22:48,531
- What are you doing?
- Ah, friends!

1042
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:52,839
You are here already.
And in good company.

1043
01:22:53,142 --> 01:22:55,235
The best in the hotel.

1044
01:22:55,311 --> 01:22:59,975
- Have you met?
- We've known each other for a long time.

1045
01:23:00,049 --> 01:23:05,783
- The lady is my sister.
- Really? How interesting!

1046
01:23:05,855 --> 01:23:10,724
I'm about to close a fantastic
deal with your brother.

1047
01:23:10,793 --> 01:23:14,661
- I'm going to make you rich.
- Him, I'm sure not me.

1048
01:23:14,731 --> 01:23:17,928
Shit! I seem to notice
some tension in the air.

1049
01:23:18,001 --> 01:23:22,665
The best would be for us to go
to your room and finish our business.

1050
01:23:22,739 --> 01:23:24,263
Let us.

1051
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:26,808
Let's finish our business, yes.

1052
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:33,080
- You okay? Did he hurt you?
- No, he didn't hurt me. I'm okay.

1053
01:23:37,253 --> 01:23:41,587
I've just made a change
in our agreement. An addition.

1054
01:23:41,658 --> 01:23:44,650
- In the price?
- No, in the package.

1055
01:23:44,727 --> 01:23:48,026
- I want to include her.
- Valeria?

1056
01:23:48,097 --> 01:23:52,966
Valeria, yes. Knowing she's
your sister makes me hornier.

1057
01:23:54,203 --> 01:23:57,695
Man, it's only one night. Tonight.

1058
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:02,674
I've been wanting to fuck her
since I got here but I couldn't.

1059
01:24:02,745 --> 01:24:06,374
And now I can.
Do you want the money?

1060
01:24:06,449 --> 01:24:09,577
- Convince her.
- Lf she doesn't want?

1061
01:24:09,652 --> 01:24:11,517
Then the deal is off.

1062
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:14,318
You are willing to give up
the stamps for a piece of ass?

1063
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:17,416
More than you are willing
to give up the money.

1064
01:24:17,493 --> 01:24:21,293
Have her bring me the stamps.
But it's got to be her.

1065
01:24:21,364 --> 01:24:23,764
I won't receive anyone else.

1066
01:24:35,945 --> 01:24:37,674
What happened?

1067
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:51,484
If it were any other woman,
I'd have 50 ways to convince her.

1068
01:24:51,728 --> 01:24:53,525
And all good.

1069
01:24:54,197 --> 01:24:57,655
But not her.
It's different with her.

1070
01:24:58,935 --> 01:25:02,132
- Valeria won't go for it.
- How do you know?

1071
01:25:03,339 --> 01:25:05,671
From what I've seen so far...

1072
01:25:06,576 --> 01:25:08,669
You like her, shithead.

1073
01:25:08,745 --> 01:25:13,580
I saw you looking at her.
You must believe she's a saint.

1074
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:16,441
Can't you see the way
she swings her ass?

1075
01:25:16,519 --> 01:25:18,316
There are no saints.

1076
01:25:22,558 --> 01:25:25,288
There are different tariffs.

1077
01:25:26,829 --> 01:25:28,820
Do you like men?

1078
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:33,965
- Would you fuck a guy?
- No.

1079
01:25:38,174 --> 01:25:43,476
- You wouldn't fuck a guy for 1 0,000?
- No.

1080
01:25:43,546 --> 01:25:45,571
1 0,000, it's a lot of money.

1081
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:47,976
No.

1082
01:25:48,818 --> 01:25:51,446
If I gave you 20,000?

1083
01:25:51,621 --> 01:25:53,953
- Real money. All for you.
- No.

1084
01:25:55,658 --> 01:25:58,422
- 50,000 dollars.
- No.

1085
01:26:03,399 --> 01:26:05,299
500,000.

1086
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:09,761
You see?

1087
01:26:10,073 --> 01:26:13,236
We are not lacking pillow biters,
just financiers.

1088
01:26:20,016 --> 01:26:22,917
- Have you seen Valeria?
- Over there.

1089
01:26:32,595 --> 01:26:33,892
Valeria.

1090
01:26:33,996 --> 01:26:36,089
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Give me a minute.

1091
01:26:36,165 --> 01:26:39,657
- I don't want to listen.
- It's about our grandparents' money.

1092
01:26:41,604 --> 01:26:44,698
Chito, go get Federico.
Tell him to come.

1093
01:26:44,774 --> 01:26:47,937
- No need to bring in the kid.
- Why not? We share expenses.

1094
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:50,410
We are roommates.
He's got a right to know.

1095
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:51,970
To know what?

1096
01:26:52,048 --> 01:26:56,610
Whatever it is you are going
to propose. I know you.

1097
01:26:56,686 --> 01:26:59,587
What do I have that interests you?

1098
01:27:03,159 --> 01:27:05,423
I have a big deal going on
with Vidal Gandolfo.

1099
01:27:22,912 --> 01:27:25,472
What is it? You again?
What happened?

1100
01:27:25,548 --> 01:27:27,140
How are you?

1101
01:27:27,216 --> 01:27:29,411
You tell him or shall I?

1102
01:27:31,053 --> 01:27:34,352
Your brother wants me to sleep with a guy,
so that he can make a deal.

1103
01:27:34,423 --> 01:27:36,653
He wants to give me money for it.

1104
01:27:36,726 --> 01:27:38,785
- Some of the money he stole from us.
- It's not true.

1105
01:27:38,861 --> 01:27:42,695
Bastard! What do you need
to tell the truth just once?

1106
01:27:42,765 --> 01:27:46,963
- Not again. Why did you call?
- Listen to your brother's proposal.

1107
01:27:47,036 --> 01:27:49,027
This is between you and I.
Leave him out of it.

1108
01:27:49,105 --> 01:27:52,268
- He's right. Bye.
- Fede, Fede!

1109
01:28:04,587 --> 01:28:08,421
Tell him the truth.
I'll win the lawsuit.

1110
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:11,824
I don't want money,
I want you to tell him the truth.

1111
01:28:11,894 --> 01:28:14,260
He'll decide the rest.

1112
01:28:19,135 --> 01:28:23,128
If I tell him the truth,
you'll go with Vidal?

1113
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:25,029
Yes.

1114
01:28:27,276 --> 01:28:29,710
And how do I know you'll do your part?

1115
01:28:31,214 --> 01:28:33,682
Give me your word.

1116
01:28:34,150 --> 01:28:36,641
That has always been your weak spot.

1117
01:28:37,386 --> 01:28:39,946
I give you my word.

1118
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:50,662
Fede, come!

1119
01:28:56,606 --> 01:28:58,301
Now what?

1120
01:28:59,242 --> 01:29:02,939
Are you sure?
The truth can hurt.

1121
01:29:06,849 --> 01:29:09,613
It's a complicated matter.

1122
01:29:09,685 --> 01:29:12,620
Your sister is right
about our grandparent's estate.

1123
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:17,056
My lawyer blocked the estate in Italy...

1124
01:29:17,159 --> 01:29:20,060
and submitted me as the only heir.

1125
01:29:20,329 --> 01:29:22,991
We bribed some officers...

1126
01:29:23,866 --> 01:29:26,164
and split the money.

1127
01:29:26,402 --> 01:29:27,869
Don't give me that.

1128
01:29:33,075 --> 01:29:34,872
Tell me it's not true.

1129
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:38,077
I'd love to but I can't.

1130
01:29:39,815 --> 01:29:43,307
That thing about the middle man
in Italy stealing the money, the taxes?

1131
01:29:43,386 --> 01:29:44,876
I didn't want you to find out...

1132
01:29:44,954 --> 01:29:47,787
That my big brother robbed me
and lied to me.

1133
01:29:48,157 --> 01:29:50,057
It was a lot of money.

1134
01:29:50,326 --> 01:29:52,851
What's that about screwing a guy?

1135
01:29:52,929 --> 01:29:54,920
She's a grown-up,
she knows what she's doing, Fede.

1136
01:29:54,997 --> 01:29:56,328
Don't call me Fede.

1137
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:59,099
Don't call me anything.

1138
01:30:06,475 --> 01:30:08,636
That's it then.

1139
01:30:08,711 --> 01:30:10,338
Go to Vidal's.
Remember...

1140
01:30:54,890 --> 01:30:58,621
Make sure the money is good.

1141
01:30:58,761 --> 01:31:02,959
And count it.
I don't want to be screwed.

1142
01:31:03,632 --> 01:31:05,930
Then put it here.

1143
01:31:35,865 --> 01:31:38,857
Let's go downstairs.
What can we do here?

1144
01:32:24,146 --> 01:32:25,807
Hey, hey!

1145
01:32:46,669 --> 01:32:49,035
- Is she out?
- No.

1146
01:32:50,673 --> 01:32:52,607
- Did you sleep at all?
- No.

1147
01:32:52,708 --> 01:32:55,336
Not everybody is so lucky
to have a clean conscience.

1148
01:32:55,411 --> 01:32:56,742
What?

1149
01:33:41,357 --> 01:33:43,882
- Watch it, man.
- Vidal... Vidal!

1150
01:33:43,959 --> 01:33:47,588
My dear friend, you came
to say goodbye. Nice gesture.

1151
01:33:47,663 --> 01:33:52,157
- The money...
- The girl's got it like I told you.

1152
01:33:52,234 --> 01:33:54,725
By the way, I don't know
what her cut is in this...

1153
01:33:54,803 --> 01:33:57,135
but whatever it is, it's not enough.

1154
01:33:57,306 --> 01:34:00,434
- What a woman!
- Mr. Vidal...

1155
01:34:00,943 --> 01:34:03,275
No, he can't leave.
She hasn't come down yet...

1156
01:34:03,345 --> 01:34:05,006
- Hear that?
- Vidal...

1157
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,071
This is fun. I can't leave!

1158
01:34:07,149 --> 01:34:10,312
"The girl hasn't come down yet."
I can't leave?

1159
01:34:35,444 --> 01:34:37,309
A check?

1160
01:34:43,953 --> 01:34:47,548
A check? You are such
an asshole! What is it?

1161
01:34:47,623 --> 01:34:50,148
The guy is hung like a horse?
How can you take a check?

1162
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:52,285
A registered check.

1163
01:34:52,361 --> 01:34:55,797
A check certified by the bank.
It's the same as cash.

1164
01:34:55,864 --> 01:34:58,799
I know what a certified check is.
He didn't have time to do it.

1165
01:34:58,867 --> 01:35:00,858
He fixed the price yesterday afternoon.

1166
01:35:00,936 --> 01:35:03,700
He had several
checks with different figures.

1167
01:35:03,772 --> 01:35:06,297
He must have fixed yours
considering the checks he had.

1168
01:35:08,010 --> 01:35:11,571
He had one for 600 and another for 650.

1169
01:35:12,281 --> 01:35:15,773
- You came out cheap.
- How do you know that?

1170
01:35:15,851 --> 01:35:18,843
The hotel has
an executive assistance service.

1171
01:35:19,088 --> 01:35:23,081
- We did it for him.
- The same as cash.

1172
01:35:35,170 --> 01:35:37,502
It's 45 minutes before the bank opens.

1173
01:35:37,573 --> 01:35:40,337
Have a drink.
I have to make a couple of calls.

1174
01:35:48,284 --> 01:35:52,414
- It's over.
- This will never be over.

1175
01:35:53,255 --> 01:35:56,952
- No, I referred to this business.
- Me too.

1176
01:35:59,161 --> 01:36:03,188
- How is Federico?
- He'll be fine.

1177
01:36:12,708 --> 01:36:16,007
- It's the Banco Sudamericano de Crédito.
- I've noticed.

1178
01:36:16,078 --> 01:36:18,478
A friend of mine works there.
Not a friend.

1179
01:36:18,547 --> 01:36:22,313
A guy I once did a favor to.
I put him into business.

1180
01:36:22,384 --> 01:36:26,946
I wanted to say something.
I wanted to apologize.

1181
01:36:28,390 --> 01:36:31,018
- Why?
- Because I didn't trust you.

1182
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:33,785
The truth is I thought you were fucking me.

1183
01:36:49,778 --> 01:36:51,541
I wanted...

1184
01:36:53,449 --> 01:36:55,781
to thank you.

1185
01:36:56,618 --> 01:36:58,518
After all...

1186
01:37:02,424 --> 01:37:04,722
You're welcome.

1187
01:37:31,019 --> 01:37:33,681
I forgot the cigarettes.
Wait.

1188
01:37:44,199 --> 01:37:45,826
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

1189
01:37:58,981 --> 01:38:00,573
Let's go.

1190
01:38:03,819 --> 01:38:07,983
- I thought the bank was nearby.
- It's not that bad.

1191
01:38:08,457 --> 01:38:11,620
Turco, son of a bitch.
It serves him right for disappearing.

1192
01:38:11,693 --> 01:38:13,888
He'll want to die when he finds out.

1193
01:38:14,730 --> 01:38:17,824
- We're a good pair, you and I.
- Yes, but no.

1194
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:21,792
- We settle the numbers, collect and that's it.
- Really?

1195
01:38:21,870 --> 01:38:26,204
Yes, sir. It's over.
We split the cash and that's it.

1196
01:38:26,275 --> 01:38:28,505
You're offended because
I made you make a fortune?

1197
01:38:28,577 --> 01:38:31,171
- You and I are different, Marcos.
- Different?

1198
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:34,374
Of course we are.
You know what the difference is?

1199
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:38,250
I can handle what I do.
You're afraid of being singled out.

1200
01:38:38,987 --> 01:38:41,285
Do you think you are better than I am?

1201
01:38:41,356 --> 01:38:43,881
You are the worst kind.
You are a coward.

1202
01:38:43,959 --> 01:38:45,950
You want the money but you
don't want to get your hands dirty.

1203
01:38:46,028 --> 01:38:47,586
Do you know the difference?

1204
01:38:47,663 --> 01:38:49,654
To be a bastard
you need guts.

1205
01:38:49,731 --> 01:38:52,461
To be a real bastard...

1206
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:58,336
No, wait, Castrito,
let me explain. Please!

1207
01:38:58,941 --> 01:39:01,136
Over there.
Come!

1208
01:39:01,210 --> 01:39:02,700
Get in there!

1209
01:39:04,746 --> 01:39:08,910
Let me explain! I was going
to pay you! My mother got sick.

1210
01:39:08,984 --> 01:39:11,680
- Your mother is dead!
- Right, she got sick and died...

1211
01:39:11,753 --> 01:39:13,550
Shut up! Piece of shit!

1212
01:39:13,622 --> 01:39:15,988
For a year you've been giving me
the same old story!

1213
01:39:16,058 --> 01:39:18,117
I want my money, now!
Or I'll fuck you up!

1214
01:39:18,193 --> 01:39:22,152
- Please, I beg you!
- Stop begging! I want my money now.

1215
01:39:22,231 --> 01:39:24,358
Or I'll kill you like a dog.

1216
01:39:26,768 --> 01:39:28,133
Kid...

1217
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:42,979
Are you kidding?

1218
01:39:43,485 --> 01:39:46,010
You want to get killed for a fucking check?

1219
01:39:46,088 --> 01:39:48,818
The thing is...
What did you do with the money?

1220
01:39:50,893 --> 01:39:54,989
I hid it. I didn't want
to risk being robbed again.

1221
01:39:55,998 --> 01:39:59,434
- Give it to me.
- No, if you kill me, there's no money.

1222
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:03,235
- Then I'll kill him.
- Go ahead.

1223
01:40:03,305 --> 01:40:06,502
- Please!
- I'll kill him.

1224
01:40:08,243 --> 01:40:10,108
- Shit happens.
- Juan!

1225
01:40:10,445 --> 01:40:12,003
- No.
- No?

1226
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:14,241
- No.
- Why?

1227
01:40:14,316 --> 01:40:17,410
- Because he said "fucking check".
- What?

1228
01:40:17,486 --> 01:40:20,751
- You said "check" instead of"dough".
- I didn't say check.

1229
01:40:20,822 --> 01:40:23,882
- Yes, you did.
- I didn't say check.

1230
01:40:23,959 --> 01:40:28,089
Yes, you said check.
Goddamn you!

1231
01:40:28,764 --> 01:40:31,460
You called me on short notice.
I had no time to prepare.

1232
01:40:31,533 --> 01:40:35,435
Fuck off, nitwit!
You are an asshole, get out!

1233
01:40:35,804 --> 01:40:38,466
And my fifty?
I need fifty to pay for the gun.

1234
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:43,341
Shove that gun up your ass.
Fucking shithead!

1235
01:40:44,379 --> 01:40:46,870
Do you understand why I need you?

1236
01:40:59,995 --> 01:41:02,896
Why do you give me that
raped virgin's look? What is it?

1237
01:41:03,198 --> 01:41:05,530
You know my business.
What did you expect?

1238
01:41:05,934 --> 01:41:07,834
A miracle.

1239
01:41:17,846 --> 01:41:20,314
Let's go.
The bank is already open.

1240
01:41:20,382 --> 01:41:23,647
- I carry the check.
- No... the deal is mine.

1241
01:41:23,719 --> 01:41:26,620
Give me the check.

1242
01:42:26,114 --> 01:42:28,514
Crdenas! Crdenas!

1243
01:42:39,161 --> 01:42:41,891
- What happened, Crdenas?
- What are you doing here?

1244
01:42:41,963 --> 01:42:43,294
You're lucky.

1245
01:42:43,365 --> 01:42:45,526
At any other time I'd have gone out
and beaten the hell out of you.

1246
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,034
I'll give it back to you. A problem
with my accountant. What happened?

1247
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:54,001
We were all royally screwed.
We found out this morning.

1248
01:42:54,209 --> 01:42:57,007
They held as long as possible,
and when the going got rough...

1249
01:42:57,079 --> 01:42:59,240
they sold all the assets and took off.

1250
01:42:59,314 --> 01:43:00,406
- Who?
- The Board.

1251
01:43:00,482 --> 01:43:03,713
All eleven.
They took 1 3 5 million.

1252
01:43:05,921 --> 01:43:09,516
The Central Bank did know
but they only took part today.

1253
01:43:10,292 --> 01:43:13,090
- I've got to go.
- Wait... Come. This is good?

1254
01:43:15,997 --> 01:43:19,228
- Wow! What are you into?
- Crdenas! Is it good or not?

1255
01:43:20,435 --> 01:43:23,495
Maybe. But what difference
does it make?

1256
01:43:25,207 --> 01:43:27,573
Wait...
This is for you?

1257
01:43:34,382 --> 01:43:37,010
You were going to cash this?

1258
01:43:39,321 --> 01:43:42,051
You'll have to shove it
up your ass, Marquitos.

1259
01:46:35,297 --> 01:46:36,889
Hey...

1260
01:47:27,148 --> 01:47:30,379
- How many?
- Give me two.

1261
01:47:30,452 --> 01:47:33,421
- None for me.
- Who said you could use my chips?

1262
01:47:33,488 --> 01:47:36,355
- NI NE QUEENS
- Not yours, your father's.

1263
01:47:36,424 --> 01:47:40,383
- Don't interrupt.
- Are you tired, Sebastin, or in a bad mood?

1264
01:47:40,495 --> 01:47:43,123
Boris, at the theatre
do you also drink that much?

1265
01:47:43,398 --> 01:47:47,562
Know what? I do a better
Spaniard when drunk.

1266
01:47:49,304 --> 01:47:53,138
The guy from the bank called,
the one who tipped you about the closing.

1267
01:47:53,208 --> 01:47:54,698
Crdenas?

1268
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:59,537
Yes, he says he'll come
to collect later today.

1269
01:48:00,382 --> 01:48:03,078
- What about Turco?
- He also called.

1270
01:48:03,151 --> 01:48:06,678
He wants to know if he can stay
another week with your cousin.

1271
01:48:17,632 --> 01:48:20,362
What are you staring at?

1272
01:48:26,975 --> 01:48:29,535
You were scared, kid.

1273
01:48:30,879 --> 01:48:32,608
Never.

1274
01:48:32,947 --> 01:48:35,848
By any chance,
do you remember a song by...

1275
01:48:35,917 --> 01:48:40,877
Rita Pavone, a song they used
for a film a long time ago?

1276
01:48:43,758 --> 01:48:45,749
Come on, Berta.

1277
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:08,881
Nice kiss you gave me
at the hotel.

1278
01:49:09,684 --> 01:49:11,777
I couldn't help it.

1279
01:49:18,726 --> 01:49:21,695
- Happy first anniversary.
- Isn't it too much?

1280
01:49:21,763 --> 01:49:23,993
- It's yours.
- And yours.

1281
01:49:24,065 --> 01:49:26,795
- Minus expenses?
- What?

1282
01:49:28,303 --> 01:49:30,328
Nothing, nothing...

1283
01:49:32,307 --> 01:49:34,207
And this?

1284
01:49:36,377 --> 01:49:38,436
It belonged to my mother.

1285
01:49:38,513 --> 01:49:40,743
My grandmother gave it to her.

1286
01:49:40,815 --> 01:49:43,079
It's been in the family for...

1287
01:49:43,318 --> 01:49:45,718
a hundred years.

1288
01:49:46,454 --> 01:49:48,149
I remembered!

1289
01:49:48,223 --> 01:49:49,247
I remembered it!
