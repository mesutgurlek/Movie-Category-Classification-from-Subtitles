1
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,625
She said it.

2
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:25,955
She said it.

3
00:01:26,297 --> 00:01:27,756
She did.

4
00:05:24,363 --> 00:05:27,198
--with some precipitation
in the Central Valley.

5
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,151
Reno area, a little milder.
Looking like a low 37 degrees...

6
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:33,571
...and a high at 42.

7
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:36,870
The low-pressure system
continues into the Sierras.

8
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:41,043
We've got some snow flurries at times
down at about 5000 feet.

9
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,422
We'll see some hazy sunshine
in the morning.

10
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:48,921
Yo, Mick.

11
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:51,092
Yeah, okay.

12
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:52,763
Thank you.

13
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:12,620
-Good morning.
-Jerry.

14
00:06:18,884 --> 00:06:20,842
-There you are.
-Morning.

15
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:24,842
Plug that fridge back in.
l thought it was going with you.

16
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:29,010
l put everything in boxes.
Everything except your pictures.

17
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:32,854
Every time l pack pictures, something
gets broken and l get blamed.

18
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:34,603
So you can do that yourself.

19
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,735
Don't forget lunch
with the lieutenant.

20
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:38,613
-1:30!
-lt's at--

21
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,237
-lt's at 1:30.
-At the Luau.

22
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:45,200
lt's at 1:30 at the Luau.

23
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,786
Thank you, Jean.

24
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,499
l'm out here if you need me.

25
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:35,871
Driver of the yellow car, Reno police.
No more parking on the street today.

26
00:08:39,713 --> 00:08:40,876
Move it.

27
00:08:48,265 --> 00:08:49,973
Come on, Stan, you're late.

28
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:22,051
Surprise!

29
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:38,567
Congratulations, Jerry.

30
00:09:38,823 --> 00:09:42,109
-l saw you parking on the street.
-You saw that?

31
00:09:43,203 --> 00:09:45,529
Hey, Larry. You outlasted me.

32
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:47,200
Hey, thanks for coming.

33
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,163
-Good to see you. Thanks.
-Congratulations.

34
00:11:29,326 --> 00:11:30,654
lsn't that smart?

35
00:11:32,538 --> 00:11:34,365
Thank you. Thank you.

36
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:39,872
Knowing you like we do, Jerry. . .

37
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,455
. . .we thought it was time
you got that marlin. . .

38
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:45,254
. . .you been dreaming about
for all these years.

39
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:48,133
So the whole department,
officers, staff. . .

40
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:52,008
. . .volunteers, everybody,
we all pooled our nickels together. . .

41
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:53,847
. . .and got you this ticket.

42
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:57,059
lt's supposed to be the best
marlin fishing in Baja.

43
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,068
So go catch a big one for us, Jer.

44
00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:08,662
Gee.

45
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:10,193
Well.

46
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:13,580
Appreciation all around.

47
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:18,581
What can l say? You shouldn't have.

48
00:12:18,841 --> 00:12:20,549
But you did. . .

49
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:26,259
. . .and it hits me deep.

50
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:29,007
Thank you.

51
00:14:04,838 --> 00:14:08,124
l'm going back to the station.
Get Becker County on the phone.

52
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:10,958
-You should go on.
-lt'll be dark when we get there.

53
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:12,217
Thanks.

54
00:14:14,057 --> 00:14:15,172
What's up?

55
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:17,720
-Juvenile homicide.
-Becker County.

56
00:14:17,978 --> 00:14:20,055
Possible sexual assault. Little girl.

57
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:21,892
The locals aren't handling it?

58
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,104
Our hard-core crime unit
assists that jurisdiction now.

59
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:28,149
Jerry, for chrissake,
you're retiring.

60
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:30,527
l still got six more hours.

61
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:33,905
As far as l'm concerned, you're gone.
lt's Krolack's case.

62
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,572
-He's in charge, his call.
-lt's fine with me.

63
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:40,879
-lf you want to leave your own party.
-My coat's upstairs.

64
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,802
Good evening.
Elena Ryan, just outside of Reno.

65
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,965
Behind, you have the crime scene. . .

66
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:54,143
. . .where the body of a young girl
has just been found.

67
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:57,812
And we have emergency vehicles
coming in and out of here.

68
00:14:59,318 --> 00:15:02,521
We have state troopers,
we have Reno police.

69
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:28,172
Bruising and lacerations evident
on the interior of both thighs.

70
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:33,810
Bruising and possible wrist
fractures due to restraints.

71
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:35,473
Neck slashed.

72
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,360
Did you get her age in there?

73
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:42,605
She was a second-grader.
l guess about 71 /2, 8.

74
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:46,155
Coupled with signs of lividity. . .

75
00:15:46,414 --> 00:15:49,617
. . .all indications are she wasn't
moved from place of death.

76
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:51,620
We checked the entire perimeter.

77
00:15:51,878 --> 00:15:54,749
Even with the snow,
this path's the only way in or out.

78
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:58,092
-Why the fuck are you standing on it?
-Oh, l'm sorry.

79
00:15:58,344 --> 00:16:01,014
--and other weather-related
contamination. . . .

80
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:03,590
Whose fucking pen is this?

81
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:07,386
Oh, Jesus, that's--
lt's mine. Pardon me.

82
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:09,100
Any sign of a weapon?

83
00:16:09,357 --> 00:16:13,818
No, but, l mean, a knife like that,
you could chuck it pretty far.

84
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:17,405
-Assuming it was a knife.
-How long before you can wrap this up?

85
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:18,607
Couple more minutes.

86
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:21,359
l'll let the coroner know
he can pick her up.

87
00:16:22,914 --> 00:16:24,195
The buttons.

88
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,708
Have the lab guys
check for prints on the buttons. . .

89
00:16:27,962 --> 00:16:31,462
. . .on both the coat and the dress.

90
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:33,668
Goddamn it.

91
00:16:36,013 --> 00:16:38,338
Strom, secure all the buttons
for lab work. . .

92
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:39,928
. . .before you move her out.

93
00:16:40,184 --> 00:16:42,889
-Guys, get the buttons.
-Let's go, big guy.

94
00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:58,571
What about the little girl's parents?

95
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:00,574
Duane and Margaret Larsen.

96
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,324
They got a turkey farm
100 miles from here.

97
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:06,042
-Good people.
-Go ahead and pick her up now!

98
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:09,211
-Have you interviewed them?
-No.

99
00:17:10,052 --> 00:17:11,380
We haven't told them yet.

100
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:14,095
None of us knew what to say!

101
00:17:16,184 --> 00:17:17,976
Jesus Christ.

102
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,727
Nobody told the little girl's parents.

103
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,063
-ls this the little boy right here?
-Yeah.

104
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,822
Evening, son.

105
00:17:31,326 --> 00:17:33,118
Chilly out here, isn't it?

106
00:17:36,749 --> 00:17:39,371
Take him to your station.
l'll talk to him there.

107
00:17:39,628 --> 00:17:42,997
-Right.
-Anything on the suspect or his truck?

108
00:17:43,257 --> 00:17:44,420
Hang on.

109
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:46,967
Highway Patrol got anything?

110
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,296
Todd said he put it out there.

111
00:17:51,683 --> 00:17:54,803
lt's out statewide,
and l got Highway Patrol on it.

112
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:56,972
Congratulations.

113
00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:00,023
Now, who's gonna tell the parents?

114
00:18:03,322 --> 00:18:04,900
Does anybody here know them?

115
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:08,444
l got one of my deputies,
but he'd rather not.

116
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:15,834
He'd rather not.

117
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:45,431
Most Wednesdays,
Ginny stays in town. . .

118
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:49,061
. . .for music lessons with my mother.

119
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:52,068
But when she's behind
on her homework. . .

120
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:55,359
. . .she comes straight home.

121
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:03,040
So her grandmother would've
assumed that she came home?

122
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,579
We always let Ginny. . . .

123
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,584
Yes.

124
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:12,923
Excuse me.

125
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,217
-Pastor Holcomb's on his way over.
-Thank you.

126
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:19,097
Would you mind not smoking
in the house, please?

127
00:20:19,354 --> 00:20:20,385
Sorry.

128
00:20:25,194 --> 00:20:27,436
lt isn't possible.

129
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:31,617
There can't be such a devil.

130
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:34,612
There are such devils.

131
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:45,665
l want to see my daughter.

132
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,639
l don't think that's
a good idea, Mr. Larsen.

133
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,102
l know what l'm saying
might sound cruel. . .

134
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:58,724
. . .but l think it's better
if you don't go to your Ginny now.

135
00:20:58,983 --> 00:21:03,729
Why would it be better for me
not to see my daughter?

136
00:21:03,988 --> 00:21:05,732
Why would that be better?!

137
00:21:11,372 --> 00:21:14,907
Because we hardly dared
to look ourselves.

138
00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:23,169
You can go to your
Ginny tomorrow evening.

139
00:21:27,682 --> 00:21:30,090
Then there won't be
anything that's. . . .

140
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:33,604
-What?
-She'll look like she fell asleep.

141
00:21:33,856 --> 00:21:35,185
Believe me.

142
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,069
Who did this?

143
00:21:44,118 --> 00:21:46,407
We intend to find out, Mrs. Larsen.

144
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,871
Do you promise me that you will?

145
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:00,833
Yes.

146
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:05,137
Yes, Mrs. Larsen, l promise.

147
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:11,393
By your soul's salvation?

148
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,239
Do you swear. . .

149
00:22:20,994 --> 00:22:24,280
. . .by your soul's salvation
on this cross. . .

150
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,996
. . .made by the hands of our daughter?

151
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:34,753
Yes.

152
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,552
Yes, on my soul's salvation.

153
00:22:46,273 --> 00:22:50,568
You've sworn by your salvation.

154
00:22:57,202 --> 00:22:58,613
We will pray.

155
00:23:35,663 --> 00:23:36,908
Detective!

156
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,207
Detective Black?

157
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,252
Looks like they got him.

158
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:46,633
Highway Patrol picked up a match
on the truck with an lndian driver.

159
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:58,933
l gave you a new headband, Toby.
l know you lost yours.

160
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:03,232
Toby, l can't see your eyes, buddy.

161
00:24:03,612 --> 00:24:05,237
You'll like this.

162
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:06,770
Let's see it.

163
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:16,584
Toby, you've already served time
for one charge of juvenile rape now.

164
00:24:16,961 --> 00:24:20,580
Statutory.
The girl was 16 years old.

165
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,711
Toby, would you tell him
that rape is rape?

166
00:24:23,969 --> 00:24:27,504
You got three years of juvenile,
you got some burglary. . .

167
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:30,138
. . .you got some theft, grand theft.

168
00:24:30,727 --> 00:24:34,227
Multiple counts of marijuana
possession. Then that first rape.

169
00:24:34,481 --> 00:24:38,230
Section Four.
Man's got a mental handicap, Stan.

170
00:24:38,486 --> 00:24:39,565
No.

171
00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:44,282
Well, number one, that might not
take the violence out of you.

172
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:46,693
Number two,
l'm gonna get a confession.

173
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:50,952
And number three,
l'm gonna do it in record time.

174
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,339
How you doing, chief?

175
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:07,970
Scared of this thing?
Let's get it out of the way then.

176
00:25:17,114 --> 00:25:18,774
Who you talking to, chief?

177
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:26,578
You got those little voices
in your head?

178
00:25:33,216 --> 00:25:36,217
-You a policeman?
-Yeah, l'm a policeman.

179
00:25:38,305 --> 00:25:40,975
-l want to be a policeman too.
-You do, huh?

180
00:25:41,225 --> 00:25:45,057
Policeman drive me here very fast.
Drive me fast.

181
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,981
-l'm just a trapper.
-We don't need this.

182
00:25:51,362 --> 00:25:52,820
l trap beaver today.

183
00:25:53,864 --> 00:25:56,071
Fifteen pounds or 25. . .

184
00:25:56,326 --> 00:26:00,158
. . .or 35, something like that.
Maybe 80.

185
00:26:01,498 --> 00:26:03,705
You mean beaver or you mean ''beaver''?

186
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:06,711
-Beaver.
-Beaver? Pretty, young pussy?

187
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:15,173
-l don't know you joking me.
-You think l'm joking?

188
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:16,344
-l don't know.
-No?

189
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:19,304
l'm not joking you.
So you catch beaver, huh?

190
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:20,841
Yeah, l--

191
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,067
-Yeah, l catch beaver.
-You catch beaver? Little girl?

192
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,984
You catch little girl today, huh?
You rape little girl?

193
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,568
ls that what you did?

194
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:33,492
l rape, l rape.

195
00:26:33,744 --> 00:26:35,072
You raped her, huh?

196
00:26:44,256 --> 00:26:45,205
Yeah.

197
00:26:46,216 --> 00:26:49,716
He could be talking about the
other rape, the one on his record.

198
00:26:49,971 --> 00:26:51,798
We got positive l.D. from the kid.

199
00:26:52,057 --> 00:26:54,678
This is a small town.
Just let him do his job.

200
00:26:54,935 --> 00:26:56,215
Tell me about the girl.

201
00:27:00,191 --> 00:27:01,935
You rape a little girl today?

202
00:27:05,822 --> 00:27:07,068
lt's okay.

203
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:08,606
You can tell me.

204
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:14,540
You killed her.

205
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:16,876
Didn't you, Toby?

206
00:27:18,545 --> 00:27:21,796
lt's all right.
lt's okay, bud. Huh?

207
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:27,298
Something simply came
over you today, didn't it?

208
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,722
All at once you became like an animal?

209
00:27:35,774 --> 00:27:38,016
You attacked and you raped her.

210
00:27:38,443 --> 00:27:40,436
You raped that little girl.

211
00:27:46,453 --> 00:27:50,533
Then, Toby, you know,
without wanting to--

212
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:54,080
But sometimes you can't
stop yourself, you know?

213
00:27:54,337 --> 00:27:56,246
And you murdered her, didn't you?

214
00:28:00,135 --> 00:28:02,175
That hurts right there, doesn't it?

215
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:07,841
Yeah?

216
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,727
You like that, huh?

217
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,436
You like that? Huh?

218
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,313
Maybe you just wanted her to be quiet.

219
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:19,062
You just wanted her
to stop screaming at you.

220
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,656
Something was stronger than you, Toby.

221
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,655
Then, when you came to yourself...

222
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:29,458
. . .you were horrified.

223
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:34,336
Then you saw that little girl. . .

224
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,759
. . .and you ran.

225
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:40,297
-l ran. l ran, l ran.
-Yeah, you ran.

226
00:28:40,557 --> 00:28:43,095
-Yeah. l ran.
-lt's all right.

227
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:45,596
lt's all right, Toby.

228
00:28:47,189 --> 00:28:49,348
-l ran.
-You ran.

229
00:28:49,692 --> 00:28:52,314
-Yeah.
-lt's all right.

230
00:28:58,911 --> 00:29:00,370
You want to cry?

231
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:05,204
Come here. Come here.

232
00:29:11,342 --> 00:29:12,920
lt's all right. Come on.

233
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:17,171
You've gotta stand up
for what you did, okay?

234
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:18,512
You gotta stand up.

235
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:23,347
-He don't know what Stan's saying.
-Stand up and confess. okay?

236
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:32,609
lt's all right.

237
00:29:43,796 --> 00:29:45,588
l killed her.

238
00:29:48,385 --> 00:29:49,630
You killed her?

239
00:29:49,887 --> 00:29:51,547
-l killed her.
-You killed her?

240
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:52,885
Yeah.

241
00:29:57,103 --> 00:29:59,262
-Say it.
-I killed a little girl.

242
00:29:59,523 --> 00:30:01,432
-Say it.
-l killed a little girl.

243
00:30:01,692 --> 00:30:03,732
You killed that little girl?

244
00:30:03,986 --> 00:30:06,691
-You killed that little girl?
-Yeah, yeah.

245
00:30:07,657 --> 00:30:10,694
Say it. Just put your hand
up to heaven and say it.

246
00:30:10,953 --> 00:30:13,824
What did you say? Say it!

247
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,333
Say it, Toby!

248
00:30:17,126 --> 00:30:19,285
Yeah, you killed her,
didn 't you, Toby?

249
00:30:19,546 --> 00:30:21,088
-Yeah, it's okay.
-I kill, I--

250
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,208
Toby, Toby, it's okay.
l got you. l got you.

251
00:30:26,262 --> 00:30:27,637
l got you.

252
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:30,466
He practically blew him.

253
00:30:37,984 --> 00:30:39,264
Coroner just called.

254
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:42,019
They found chocolate
in the girl's stomach.

255
00:30:42,406 --> 00:30:44,861
We got wrappers in the cab
of the lndian's truck.

256
00:30:45,117 --> 00:30:46,528
Deputy!

257
00:30:48,287 --> 00:30:49,533
There you go.

258
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:55,578
-Come on, Toby.
-Goddamn it!

259
00:31:00,218 --> 00:31:03,670
Come on, walk like a policeman, Toby.
You're a policeman now.

260
00:31:06,517 --> 00:31:07,797
Okay to use this phone?

261
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,848
-Yeah, go ahead.
-Christ!

262
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,820
-You fish the lakes up here, l'm told?
-Yeah.

263
00:31:20,366 --> 00:31:22,323
Anglers haven't been doing much.

264
00:31:22,577 --> 00:31:26,824
The spear houses have hit pretty heavy.
lt could be the snow cover.

265
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:28,541
Could be that.

266
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:30,453
What about the--?

267
00:31:32,255 --> 00:31:35,375
He's got my gun! He's got my gun!

268
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,926
-Tell me when, Jerry.
-Drop it!

269
00:31:41,182 --> 00:31:42,724
-He's got Hamilton!
-Let go!

270
00:31:42,975 --> 00:31:44,968
-Freeze!
-Put it down, Toby!

271
00:31:45,895 --> 00:31:47,354
No!

272
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:51,523
Don't shoot me! Please don't!
Don't shoot me!

273
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:53,854
-Toby, put it down!

274
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:55,145

-Oh, God.

276
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:07,795
-Get a roll call!

278
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:12,209
-Fitz!
-Hamilton! Michael!

279
00:32:12,468 --> 00:32:13,713
Are you hit?

280
00:32:15,263 --> 00:32:17,588
-l don't think so.
-Oh, Jesus.

281
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:20,305
All right. Oh, Mike, you all right?

282
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:25,889
Oh, my God.

283
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:29,939
-Jesus Christ.
-You all right?

284
00:32:30,655 --> 00:32:32,565
-Get an ambulance. Do it.
-Right.

285
00:32:33,158 --> 00:32:37,572
-l thought he was gonna kill me.
-You're all right! You're okay.

286
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,671
What's that, the bullet?

287
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:48,585
His tooth.

288
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:58,013
Gate 42. They'll be boarding
in about half an hour.

289
00:32:58,271 --> 00:33:01,474
-ls that Concourse E?
-Yes, it is, sir.

290
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:03,773
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

291
00:33:04,027 --> 00:33:05,819
Next in line, please.

292
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,901
Hi, how are you folks today?

293
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,615
Thank you.
Going to Cabo San Lucas today.

294
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:16,952
Wadenah had been previously convicted
of similar crimes and was on parole.

295
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:20,294
Regarding the suicide of
the suspect while in custody...

296
00:33:20,546 --> 00:33:23,464
... State's Attorney Paul Ross
has organized a committee...

297
00:33:23,717 --> 00:33:27,086
... to look into the tactics
of the Becker County Sheriff's office.

298
00:33:30,224 --> 00:33:31,220
You okay?

299
00:33:33,686 --> 00:33:34,718
Yes, thank you.

300
00:33:35,355 --> 00:33:37,763
Sheriff's investigators
worked in concert...

301
00:33:38,025 --> 00:33:40,812
... with Reno homicide detectives
for several hours...

302
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:46,065
...piecing together the trail that led
to the brisk apprehension of Wadenah.

303
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:49,031
Authorities here,
while understandably disturbed...

304
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:52,075
...by the brief hostage-taking
of one of their deputies...

305
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:54,041
...are taking some comfort...

306
00:33:54,878 --> 00:33:58,413
. . .in the swift justice of this
very dramatic evening.

307
00:34:04,931 --> 00:34:09,510
Yet, while an investigation is
underway, the consensus seems clear.

308
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:13,685
Wadenah confessed after being
identified by the young snowmobiler.

309
00:34:13,941 --> 00:34:16,859
His suicide brought a brutal end....

310
00:34:17,112 --> 00:34:21,774
Final boarding call, Northwest
flight 1607 to Cabo San Lucas.

311
00:35:45,505 --> 00:35:46,834
Customer, Oliver!

312
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:55,551
-Morning.
-Morning.

313
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:59,510
Nice day today. Can we help you
with anything in particular?

314
00:35:59,772 --> 00:36:01,052
Well, actually, there is.

315
00:36:01,524 --> 00:36:06,815
l'm looking for a person.
Annalise, or Anna-Lisa Hansen.

316
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:11,569
Yes. She would live above
the electric store.

317
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:16,450
That would be a small unit.
lt's two doors down to your left.

318
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:22,622
And if l were you, l'd go around
the corner and take the stairs up.

319
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:26,050
You shouldn't have
any trouble finding her.

320
00:36:26,469 --> 00:36:28,129
lf you don't, come back.

321
00:36:28,388 --> 00:36:30,096
Thank you. l appreciate it.

322
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:31,843
You're welcome.

323
00:36:44,865 --> 00:36:48,032
So, what is it that you need to know?

324
00:36:50,163 --> 00:36:53,248
Well, l'm trying to fill in the gaps.

325
00:36:55,377 --> 00:36:58,213
Fit all the pieces
together, Mrs. Hansen.

326
00:36:58,464 --> 00:37:01,382
lf you could remember anything. . .

327
00:37:01,635 --> 00:37:04,719
. . .from when you were interviewed. . .

328
00:37:05,472 --> 00:37:07,596
. . .anything in particular
that might. . . .

329
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,016
lt was Wednesday and she never came.

330
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:15,558
They said that she
never got on the bus. . .

331
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:18,274
. . .never even made it to the school.

332
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:22,148
l assumed that she'd gone home.

333
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:30,997
What was she like?

334
00:37:32,212 --> 00:37:35,166
What were your Wednesdays
with Ginny. . .

335
00:37:35,424 --> 00:37:36,622
. . .what were they like?

336
00:37:37,968 --> 00:37:41,836
Oh, she would come in
with her little knapsack. . .

337
00:37:42,098 --> 00:37:45,550
. . .and plop it on the floor.

338
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,643
Give me a kiss on my cheek.

339
00:37:48,897 --> 00:37:51,389
Big kiss, always my left cheek.

340
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,986
And then, it was time for work.

341
00:37:59,785 --> 00:38:02,490
The moment she would sit
at the piano. . .

342
00:38:03,623 --> 00:38:05,580
. . .we were all business.

343
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:09,293
And l would give her. . .

344
00:38:09,546 --> 00:38:14,886
. . .her lesson just the same
as all my other pupils.

345
00:38:16,304 --> 00:38:19,555
And it was no ''Grandma'' this
or ''Grandma'' that.

346
00:38:25,064 --> 00:38:27,390
But the moment we were done. . .

347
00:38:27,651 --> 00:38:29,193
. . .she was my Ginny again.

348
00:38:32,573 --> 00:38:35,527
How could God be so greedy?

349
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:38,202
Ma'am, l. . . .

350
00:38:45,963 --> 00:38:47,873
And after the lesson?

351
00:38:49,843 --> 00:38:51,302
Cookies.

352
00:38:52,888 --> 00:38:56,507
We would have cookies,
if l'd baked them.

353
00:38:56,976 --> 00:39:00,227
Sometimes l would send her down
to the Land of Christmas. . .

354
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,146
. . .the store downstairs,
for candy or ice cream.

355
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:08,773
She would eat her sweets
and l would read to her.

356
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:12,108
She loved Andersen.

357
00:39:13,286 --> 00:39:14,401
Who?

358
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,948
Do you know what he wrote
in his story ''The Angel''?

359
00:39:20,587 --> 00:39:21,749
No.

360
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,256
Here.

361
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,687
''Whenever a good child dies. . .

362
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:39,347
. . .an angel of God. . .

363
00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:42,693
. . .comes down from Heaven. . .

364
00:39:42,946 --> 00:39:45,900
. . .and takes the child in his arms.

365
00:39:46,742 --> 00:39:50,574
And spreads out his great white wings.

366
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,453
And flies with her. . .

367
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,962
. . .over all the places. . .

368
00:39:57,212 --> 00:40:00,249
. . .that she loved during her life.

369
00:40:01,425 --> 00:40:04,427
And then, the child carries. . .

370
00:40:07,516 --> 00:40:10,303
. . .a large handful of flowers. . .

371
00:40:11,145 --> 00:40:13,054
. . .up to God. ''

372
00:40:22,074 --> 00:40:23,355
Beautiful.

373
00:40:41,346 --> 00:40:42,841
What's your name?

374
00:40:44,058 --> 00:40:46,514
Becky. Becky Fiske.

375
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,809
And you were Ginny's best friend?

376
00:40:51,024 --> 00:40:52,768
We sat together.

377
00:40:53,402 --> 00:40:54,683
She died.

378
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:58,028
Yeah. l know.

379
00:41:00,243 --> 00:41:05,072
Her grandmother told me
that Ginny liked to tell stories.

380
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:08,454
Sometimes.

381
00:41:11,464 --> 00:41:13,422
What kind of stories?

382
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,251
Ginny knew a giant.

383
00:41:18,473 --> 00:41:19,753
Giant?

384
00:41:21,893 --> 00:41:23,056
Really?

385
00:41:24,021 --> 00:41:28,600
He was as big as a mountain
and gave her porcupines.

386
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,981
She called him ''The Wizard. ''

387
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,983
Ginny made a picture of him.

388
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:41,572
Ginny drew a picture of a giant?

389
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:44,293
Can l see it?

390
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,626
lt's on the wall in the hallway.

391
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,963
We put Ginny's picture--

392
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:54,263
l gotta go.

393
00:43:05,262 --> 00:43:06,971
Jean, hold my calls.

394
00:43:38,634 --> 00:43:41,090
You were supposed to be
fishing in Mexico.

395
00:43:44,224 --> 00:43:45,932
l know, Stan.

396
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:49,179
l went to the airport.

397
00:43:49,939 --> 00:43:52,181
l heard the boarding announcement.

398
00:43:54,236 --> 00:43:56,110
l just didn't feel right.

399
00:43:57,406 --> 00:44:02,282
Something went off.
l need more time on this.

400
00:44:05,373 --> 00:44:08,291
You want me to reopen a case
because you got a hunch?

401
00:44:11,047 --> 00:44:14,381
No offense, but you're retired.
You don't work here anymore.

402
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:19,597
Okay.

403
00:44:19,974 --> 00:44:21,717
l know, Stan.

404
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:26,521
l know. But could you run it
through the system for me anyway?

405
00:44:26,773 --> 00:44:28,565
You know, just a standard query.

406
00:44:28,817 --> 00:44:31,772
Similar crimes, profile, victims.

407
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:34,979
Could you?

408
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:38,070
Say, for. . .

409
00:44:45,002 --> 00:44:47,410
. . .the last 10, 12 years.

410
00:44:48,131 --> 00:44:49,709
Could you, Stan?

411
00:44:57,892 --> 00:44:59,173
Please?

412
00:45:55,042 --> 00:45:57,533
This is eight years ago
when this happened.

413
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:03,334
l'm on the job only six months
when this very big deal goes down.

414
00:46:03,885 --> 00:46:06,293
Talk about baptism by fire.

415
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,638
And to top off everything else. . .

416
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,469
. . .it was in the summer season.

417
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,015
''Politics of tourism''
and all that nonsense.

418
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:17,684
So we all feel the pressure to make
the bogeyman of it all disappear.

419
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:20,399
The brass were pretty clear
in the presumption. . .

420
00:46:20,654 --> 00:46:22,778
. . .that it was one
of those festival-goers. . .

421
00:46:23,032 --> 00:46:26,366
. . .which seemed like, you know,
a pretty good bet.

422
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:30,120
And a good way to diffuse
the kind of panic that you get. . .

423
00:46:30,374 --> 00:46:33,245
. . .when they feel that there's
a bogeyman amongst them.

424
00:46:33,503 --> 00:46:34,997
So we all figured. . .

425
00:46:35,255 --> 00:46:40,131
. . .and l do feel accurately,
that's why we never did catch him.

426
00:46:42,263 --> 00:46:45,679
The odds were on a perpetrator. . .

427
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:49,849
. . .who'd cleared the county
before the body was ever found.

428
00:46:50,981 --> 00:46:52,262
Yeah.

429
00:46:54,652 --> 00:46:56,894
Look at the slit in that neck.

430
00:46:57,155 --> 00:46:59,064
l don't know, but for me. . .

431
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:03,118
. . .it's like being in a movie.

432
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:07,823
This stuff just doesn't bother me
like it does some people. You?

433
00:47:10,253 --> 00:47:11,878
Luanne Rotze.

434
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,088
A little 10-year-old girl.

435
00:47:14,633 --> 00:47:17,670
Real little.
l mean, real small for her age.

436
00:47:17,929 --> 00:47:19,471
You know what, though?

437
00:47:19,973 --> 00:47:22,595
As horrible as that
kind of thing is. . .

438
00:47:22,851 --> 00:47:25,224
. . .l got an adrenaline rush
being part of it.

439
00:47:25,896 --> 00:47:28,933
l don't know if that's bad,
but, hey, don't hurt me.

440
00:47:29,192 --> 00:47:30,983
That's just the way it hit me.

441
00:47:31,653 --> 00:47:34,227
Nothing like it
ever happened before here.

442
00:47:34,865 --> 00:47:37,902
By the way, nothing like it
ever happened since.

443
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,536
l think that says a lot.

444
00:47:41,498 --> 00:47:44,665
-You mind if l keep this one?
-l couldn't let you do that.

445
00:47:45,002 --> 00:47:46,627
We always like to be of help. . .

446
00:47:46,879 --> 00:47:49,964
. . .but, strictly technically,
the case is still open.

447
00:47:50,967 --> 00:47:53,007
Well, then, how about the report?

448
00:47:55,556 --> 00:47:57,513
l'll make you a copy. How's that?

449
00:47:58,267 --> 00:48:00,141
Sure would appreciate it.

450
00:48:00,394 --> 00:48:02,186
But keep it between us.

451
00:48:02,438 --> 00:48:05,974
l'm not sure what the policy is
on this kind of thing. Okay?

452
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,403
My lips are sealed.

453
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,615
Lucy!

454
00:48:12,492 --> 00:48:15,612
A young horse is like a woman.
Can't predict what they'll do.

455
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,246
They're crazy.

456
00:48:24,589 --> 00:48:26,499
Excuse me. Sir?

457
00:48:26,758 --> 00:48:27,707
Sir?

458
00:48:27,968 --> 00:48:32,180
l wonder if you could tell me where
a man named James Olstad might be?

459
00:48:32,431 --> 00:48:34,508
Olstad's not a patient here.

460
00:48:35,643 --> 00:48:37,850
Well, l believe he's
the custodian, sir.

461
00:48:38,105 --> 00:48:40,430
ln the building, mopping?
He's not a patient.

462
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:42,814
-Mopping in the building?
-Not a patient.

463
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:08,854
James Olstad?

464
00:49:15,112 --> 00:49:18,564
l'm Jerry Black.
l'm a police detective.

465
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:23,368
l'd just like to talk to you
about your daughter.

466
00:49:25,749 --> 00:49:27,125
What daughter?

467
00:49:29,045 --> 00:49:33,292
You did have a daughter that went
missing three years ago, didn't you?

468
00:49:35,093 --> 00:49:39,590
Did you come here to tell me
that something happened to her?

469
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:40,845
No, sir. lt was--

470
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,177
Did you find her dead or something?

471
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,138
No. No, sir.

472
00:49:48,525 --> 00:49:50,732
We're still trying to find her.

473
00:49:54,824 --> 00:49:57,280
Anything you might tell me about her?

474
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,363
Could you describe her?

475
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,835
She must be--

476
00:50:10,217 --> 00:50:12,376
She must be different now.

477
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:19,850
She was so pretty.

478
00:50:29,156 --> 00:50:31,528
l miss her so much!

479
00:50:37,207 --> 00:50:40,742
We just used to, like,
hold each other.

480
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:46,669
l was supposed to take care of her.

481
00:50:46,926 --> 00:50:50,046
She was my little girl, you know?

482
00:50:50,555 --> 00:50:52,180
l just--

483
00:51:02,861 --> 00:51:04,735
l had my little girl.

484
00:51:08,451 --> 00:51:10,278
Where is my baby?

485
00:51:12,122 --> 00:51:15,622
The break is Monash County.
Eight years ago, we got a homicide.

486
00:51:16,085 --> 00:51:17,034
Same M.O.

487
00:51:17,295 --> 00:51:21,542
Exact same victim profile
description as the Ginny Larsen case.

488
00:51:22,342 --> 00:51:25,094
l interviewed a local officer
for the particulars.

489
00:51:25,554 --> 00:51:30,264
Little blonde girl, 10 years old,
sexual assault, throat slit.

490
00:51:30,894 --> 00:51:33,978
The photos show that
she was wearing a red dress.

491
00:51:35,899 --> 00:51:40,895
Detectives out at Morehead covered
this case. The case is still open.

492
00:51:41,155 --> 00:51:43,279
At the time of the murders. . .

493
00:51:43,617 --> 00:51:46,903
. . .Toby Wadenah was
in Stillwater Penitentiary. . .

494
00:51:47,162 --> 00:51:49,451
. . .doing time on his
own rape conviction.

495
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:52,245
-He couldn't have done it.
-He shot himself.

496
00:51:52,502 --> 00:51:54,411
-What more--
-You told him what he did.

497
00:51:54,671 --> 00:51:57,838
Let's calm down, see what Jerry's got.
You got something?

498
00:51:58,092 --> 00:52:00,630
And there's more. More.

499
00:52:00,886 --> 00:52:02,760
Here. See here?

500
00:52:03,014 --> 00:52:07,641
This is the Larsen murder. This is
the Monash County girl. And here:

501
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:10,222
Here, you see this pattern?

502
00:52:10,523 --> 00:52:14,022
Three years ago, l got a girl gone
missing, Cathy Olstad.

503
00:52:14,277 --> 00:52:17,860
Same exact description, a little
blonde girl, 9 years old. . .

504
00:52:18,115 --> 00:52:22,030
. . .last seen wearing a red dress.

505
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:27,823
And?

506
00:52:29,127 --> 00:52:30,456
And?

507
00:52:33,341 --> 00:52:34,336
Don't you see?

508
00:52:34,592 --> 00:52:37,843
l see a description that fits
a number of juvenile murders.

509
00:52:38,096 --> 00:52:41,382
And a victim profile that matches
every other in the state. . .

510
00:52:41,642 --> 00:52:43,350
. . .give or take the red dress.

511
00:52:43,602 --> 00:52:47,435
Why didn't you mention her blue eyes
while you're at it? Come on!

512
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:49,730
l mean, whatever made you think. . .

513
00:52:49,985 --> 00:52:53,105
. . .that the Larsen girl
wasn't murdered by Wadenah?

514
00:52:54,156 --> 00:52:55,401
This did.

515
00:52:56,325 --> 00:52:57,868
This convinced me.

516
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:02,533
Ginny's drawing
of the Porcupine Giant.

517
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:06,873
l have reason to believe, based on
my conversations and interviews. . .

518
00:53:07,588 --> 00:53:11,918
. . .that Ginny Larsen made this drawing
just days before she was murdered.

519
00:53:12,177 --> 00:53:14,799
l have reason to believe
she met with this man. . .

520
00:53:15,055 --> 00:53:18,970
. . .seen here as a giant, all dressed
in black, on a regular basis.

521
00:53:19,227 --> 00:53:23,272
This is not an lndian.
This is not an lndian type.

522
00:53:23,523 --> 00:53:26,608
And you see this car here?
This big, black car?

523
00:53:26,861 --> 00:53:28,106
This is not a truck.

524
00:53:28,362 --> 00:53:31,566
This is not a maroon truck
like Wadenah drove.

525
00:53:31,825 --> 00:53:34,696
This is a big, black station wagon.

526
00:53:34,953 --> 00:53:37,871
And these right here,
according to an interview l had. . .

527
00:53:38,124 --> 00:53:42,039
. . .with a girl named Beck--
Betsy Fiske. . .

528
00:53:42,295 --> 00:53:44,787
-. . .these are porcupines.
-Okay. Whoa! Hold it.

529
00:53:45,048 --> 00:53:47,374
Porcupines and giants and--

530
00:53:47,635 --> 00:53:50,256
You got to get ahold
of yourself, Jerry.

531
00:53:50,513 --> 00:53:52,589
The case is closed.

532
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,469
l made a promise.

533
00:53:57,396 --> 00:54:01,097
l made a promise to find. . .

534
00:54:02,652 --> 00:54:04,977
. . .Ginny Larsen's murderer.

535
00:54:05,697 --> 00:54:07,405
l intend to keep it.

536
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,089
Listen, Jerry.

537
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:28,596
You gotta start getting on
with your life, you know?

538
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:34,271
l mean, sometimes when you
go through big changes. . .

539
00:54:34,522 --> 00:54:36,396
. . .and retirement's one of them. . .

540
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:39,520
. . .it can cause a lot of added stress.

541
00:54:40,737 --> 00:54:42,980
Sometimes it's a good idea just to. . .

542
00:54:43,658 --> 00:54:46,030
. . .talk to someone.
You know, someone. . .

543
00:54:46,995 --> 00:54:48,074
. . .professional.

544
00:54:48,788 --> 00:54:50,532
l made a promise, Eric.

545
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:53,876
You're old enough to remember
when that meant something.

546
00:55:02,846 --> 00:55:04,590
Get a life.

547
00:55:53,947 --> 00:55:56,783
Jerry, got your fresh towels here!

548
00:55:57,534 --> 00:55:59,408
Most don't need them every day.

549
00:55:59,662 --> 00:56:03,743
Please don't get them so dirty
they're not to be white again.

550
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,500
Here's your nice little sunroom.
You can smoke in here.

551
00:56:07,755 --> 00:56:11,089
This is the living room area.
No partying, please, no.

552
00:56:11,342 --> 00:56:14,130
Kitchen, of course.
All the amenities of home.

553
00:56:14,387 --> 00:56:18,255
Bedroom. We just got a new mattress,
so it should be really comfy.

554
00:56:18,517 --> 00:56:21,637
And oh, yeah, trash goes
in the covered dumpster.

555
00:56:21,896 --> 00:56:26,891
Fish guts you gotta wrap and place in
the pail next to the cleaning station.

556
00:56:27,152 --> 00:56:30,735
Rules and regulations
of Sugar Bush up here. Yep.

557
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:32,899
And no nude sunbathing.

558
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:36,160
l'll leave these here
and get Rose to make up your bed.

559
00:56:36,413 --> 00:56:40,197
lf there's anything else you need,
just let me know. Okey-dokey?

560
00:59:06,294 --> 00:59:07,574
Good morning.

561
00:59:09,548 --> 00:59:11,505
l'll have a pack of lights.

562
00:59:16,848 --> 00:59:17,797
That the owner?

563
00:59:18,475 --> 00:59:19,637
My daddy.

564
00:59:21,478 --> 00:59:22,807
What can l do for you?

565
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:26,972
l was just having a look around.

566
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:30,109
How long you had this place?

567
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:32,817
Thirty years.

568
00:59:35,077 --> 00:59:37,070
Ever think about selling it?

569
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:38,945
No.

570
00:59:40,291 --> 00:59:45,037
Well, what would it take to get
you to think about selling?

571
00:59:45,673 --> 00:59:46,918
lt's not for sale.

572
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,213
l'll tell you what.

573
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:57,926
l'll give you my number
over where l'm staying. . .

574
00:59:58,187 --> 01:00:01,557
. . .at Thompson's Sugar Bush Resort.

575
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:03,767
l don't mean to be pushy but. . .

576
01:00:04,361 --> 01:00:06,270
. . .if you'd think about it. . . .

577
01:00:07,364 --> 01:00:11,197
l'll wait to hear from you over at
Thompson's, if it's all right.

578
01:00:11,995 --> 01:00:15,079
-Been a pleasure.
-Thanks for coming in.

579
01:00:15,832 --> 01:00:17,541
Nice place.

580
01:00:41,153 --> 01:00:43,230
You didn't tell me
you were a cop!

581
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:46,610
-Ex-cop.
-Once a cop. . . .

582
01:00:48,829 --> 01:00:50,489
l'm retired.

583
01:00:50,914 --> 01:00:53,869
What l wanted to tell you was
that Floyd Cage called.

584
01:00:54,127 --> 01:00:58,374
The fellow with the gas station.
He says he wants to talk to you.

585
01:00:59,466 --> 01:01:01,126
l see they're biting.

586
01:01:02,261 --> 01:01:05,179
You bet. Sure does look like it.

587
01:01:05,431 --> 01:01:08,136
You can use the phone
up in the front cabin here.

588
01:01:08,393 --> 01:01:09,804
Thank you.

589
01:01:26,205 --> 01:01:30,749
Floyd, Jerry signed all the papers.
You're ready to go.

590
01:01:31,169 --> 01:01:33,577
l sure appreciate it.
You've done a good job.

591
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:34,621
Good luck.

592
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:39,627
When we get a number down in Arizona,
we'll give you a call.

593
01:01:39,888 --> 01:01:41,263
l'm going to Arizona!

594
01:01:41,515 --> 01:01:42,795
Call if you forget something. . .

595
01:01:43,058 --> 01:01:46,344
. . .or want to know where something is,
or whatever. . . .

596
01:01:46,604 --> 01:01:48,312
-Good luck to you.
-Thank you.

597
01:01:55,656 --> 01:01:57,198
l hope you'll be happy here. . .

598
01:01:57,450 --> 01:02:02,278
. . .cause you're never gonna be able
to sell it for what you paid.

599
01:02:02,956 --> 01:02:05,032
Thank you, l'll do my best.

600
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:06,870
ls this working or what?

601
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:11,255
l have to get a key.
l'll be right with you, thank you.

602
01:03:37,106 --> 01:03:39,183
-l'll be right with you.
-Thank you.

603
01:03:44,156 --> 01:03:45,532
What can l get you?

604
01:03:46,242 --> 01:03:47,950
Just a beer, thanks.

605
01:03:49,662 --> 01:03:51,988
You the cop
who bought the gas station?

606
01:03:52,249 --> 01:03:54,870
l'm retired from
the police department.

607
01:03:56,921 --> 01:03:59,163
And you bought Floyd's station?

608
01:04:02,427 --> 01:04:03,341
l did.

609
01:04:03,887 --> 01:04:06,924
That's a strange thing to do.
You must be an angler.

610
01:04:07,183 --> 01:04:11,015
-How'd you guess?
-Nothing else to do around here.

611
01:04:11,563 --> 01:04:13,057
Yeah.

612
01:04:36,842 --> 01:04:38,882
Sorry about that.

613
01:04:41,097 --> 01:04:44,181
These things only work half the time.

614
01:04:50,107 --> 01:04:52,147
Sign right there for me,
if you would.

615
01:04:54,445 --> 01:04:56,189
That's for you.

616
01:05:11,548 --> 01:05:12,580
Thank you and. . .

617

-. . .here's your receipt.
-Thank you, sir. Have a good day.

618
01:05:54,181 --> 01:05:56,388
All right, 10 regular.

619
01:05:58,269 --> 01:06:02,184
Nice wagon. Sticks out around here,
doesn't it?

620
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,851
Never thought about it.

621
01:06:04,109 --> 01:06:07,027
Just know to get them black,
don't show dirt as much.

622
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:14,200
Ten it is. Thanks for stopping by.
