154
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,842
7:00pm sharp!

155
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,514
Has any of you motherfuckers
seen Chester?

156
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,713
- No, not me.
- Here we go again.

157
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,886
Girl, she saw hisself
trying to cheat on me.

158
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,853
While I'm up in there, girl! Me, bitch!

159
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,614
- I wish I never told her.
- I heard about that fish.

160
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:07,847
And who the fuck is she?

161
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,049
Desiree! Sounds like Desiree.

162
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,787
Girl, do you really want
to go back to prison?

163
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,396
You just got out, mama.

164
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,821
I told her that too.

165
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,467
He act like prison is a bad place to go.

166
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,330
Mama, mama, you are so much better
than she is.

167
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,507
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Look. My boyfriend, my husband.

168
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,709
OK, that's fine. But he's not with you.
He's with her.

169
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,412
He left you for her
the minute you went to jail.

170
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,909
- Girl, I am so mad.
- Why don't you just stop?

171
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,979
- I don't know what else to say.
- The only thing I can say is this.

172
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,149
Get that motherfucker!

173
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,476
SIN-DEE: Oh, girl.

174
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,313
Another black boy on a board.

175
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,023
They all think
they are goddamn Lil Wayne.

176
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,859
ALEXANDRA: I remember
one Christmas, I was like six or seven,

177
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:48,357
my family bought me
the cutest little Barney doll,

178
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,029
that I would take with me everywhere.

179
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:55,605
And one day I put it inside
the tub with me,

180
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,772
- to give it a bath.
- Oh, girl, she tried her out.

181
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,668
And it just stopped working.

182
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,867
It stopped singing
the "I love you" song.

183
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,877
And I was just so upset.

184
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,879
The world can be a cruel place.

185
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,245
SIN-DEE:
Yeah, it is cruel. God gave me a penis.

186
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,520
That's pretty damn cruel,
don't you think?

187
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:15,289
You speak English pretty good.
Where are you from?

188
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,026
I'm Armenian.

189
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,859
Yeah, I knew some people,
came from Armenia.

190
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,865
Brought a lot of jewelry with them,
when they got out.

191
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,436
They lived on that jewelry,
had a restaurant.

192
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,369
What part of Armenia?

193
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,198
From the capital.

194
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,043
From Yerevan.

195
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:36,479
Shit.

196
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:40,110
I'm from Oklahoma,
and I am a Cherokee Indian.

197
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,580
I got... I got a girl's name, Mia.

198
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,785
But, it's a feminine name in English,
but it's not in Cherokee.

199
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,985
I was named like all
Indian Cherokee babies are named.

200
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,989
First thing the mother sees
when the baby is born

201
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,825
she names that fucking baby.

202
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,060
So when I was born,
my mama looked out the window,

203
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:03,229
and she seen a red bird,
flying overhead in the sky.

204
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,009
Cherokee Indian name
for red bird is Mia Mia.

205
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,078
- So, she called me Mia.
- (CHUCKLES)

206
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,913
If you think that's a girl's name,
it's not.

207
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,022
I'm glad she didn't look out
the window and see an outhouse.

208
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:20,849
- (LAUGHING)
- Can you imagine?

209
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,186
Look, hey,
here comes "Big Shit Thompson!"

210
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,861
Right down the goddamn street.
Here he comes.

211
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,588
Oh, fuck.

212
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,034
- You OK?
- I don't know.

213
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,161
You got any aspirin?

214
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,505
- No.
- Oh, fuck.

215
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,533
- Is this Sunset Boulevard?
- Yeah.

216
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,437
You said you are going downtown, right?

217
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:45,615
Yeah.

218
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,010
I'm in no hurry.

219
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,222
I'm gonna take 101, OK?

220
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,859
I don't give a shit.

221
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,831
You do what you want to do.
You're the driver.

222
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,027
Remember, Sin-Dee. No drama!

223
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,394
Yeah, no drama.

224
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,032
(SPEAKING SPANISH) Hello.

225
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,499
Hey, Mila, did you see Nash?
That little negro.

226
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,693
In the back.

227
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,544
Girl. Nash!

228
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,350
Hi, Nash! Girl, girl, it's Nash, girl!

229
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,376
What's up, Sin-Dee. How are you doing?

230
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,281
- I haven't seen you forever.
- Yeah.

231
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,511
It's been a long time.

232
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,452
It's cool. I'm glad you're out
and everything.

233
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,556
Look at this,
business is booming today. Yes!

234
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,851
How can I help you?

235
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,393
I just haven't seen you in a long time.

236
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,030
You are... Chester.

237
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,460
I haven't seen Chester
in a long time, either.

238
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,725
Me, neither.

239
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,300
He's been hanging out
with my new friend.

240
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,630
Her name is Dani.

241
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,530
Something Dominique... Desiree...

242
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,737
No, I ain't seen her, sorry.

243
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,039
Well. Listen, Sin-Dee.
It's good seeing you, but...

244
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,882
No, no, no, no.

245
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,278
You know where the fuck she is.
So stop lying to me Nash.

246
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,612
And tell me where the fuck she is...

247
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,483
Sin-Dee, just calm down.
I ain't seen nobody.

248
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,257
This is a place for business,
I am trying to...

249
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,823
You know who the fuck
I am talking about?

250
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,323
Tell me where the fuck she is.

251
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,655
- Listen! First of all...
- OK.

252
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,920
Get some Tic-Tacs.

253
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,327
Number two, I don't know who the fuck
you are talking about.

254
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,660
This is my place of business.

255
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,302
And you are fucking my shit up
right now.

256
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,301
Oh, shut the fuck up
you lackey ass bitch!

257
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,939
- Where the fuck is she?
- I ain't telling you shit.

258
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,301
And you need to get
the fuck out of here!

259
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,841
Look, I'm not doing this!
I'm out of here. Cause you know...

260
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,842
I told you, I already told you!

261
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,013
Bye!

262
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,841
Girl! Alexandra, girl! Hold on!

263
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,676
Just one more minute...

264
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,819
Would you just go with your homeboy
and get the fuck out of here?

265
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,184
Oh, now you want to talk shit?

266
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,765
I'm not going nowhere!

267
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,434
- I don't know who...
- Where are they?

268
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:23,768
I don't support that pimping shit.

269
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:24,964
I stay on my side of the business.

270
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,201
I am morally opposed
to the pimping shit.

271
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,639
So, listen. Don't ask me shit like that.

272
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,993
- Alright, listen, listen.
- Hello?

273
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,163
Half of the city is down at Schrader.

274
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,956
There is a food line
and they are giving away

275
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,861
$20 Christmas gift certificate.
Some shit like that, alright?

276
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,364
- Schrader!
- Food line!

277

Anybody have a lighter?

Anybody have a fucking light?

Do you have a light? Excuse me. Hey!

Excuse me, hello! Do you have a light?

You know where they're at?

419
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,045
A few days ago, she was at the Grand.

420
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,413
- Off of Vermont.
- Classy!

421
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,659
- Right? Simple.
- Sure.

422
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,825
She comes back,
takes a piece of broccoli,

423
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,828
eats it and was like...
"Oh, I don't think I like this."

424
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,001
And I'm like, "You haven't even
eaten any food yet."

- You stay with her, okay.

And I put them down.

431
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,250
- She drinks out of my straw.
- Nice.

432
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,851
Just classy, huh?

433

- No.

It's enough, let him go.

- What's going on?
- This lady just attacked me.

443
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,777
- He owes me fucking money.
- Is it true?

444
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,310
No, I don't even know her.

445
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,646
I got out of my car and she attacked me.

446
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,386
So a random woman just grabs you
and attacks you.

447
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:44,713
- Yes.
- Yes.

You know I don't do that shit.

451
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,051
I don't know. What's happening?

452
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:54,525
- He owes me money.
- I don't owe you money.

453
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,198
- Forty dollars.
- Forty dollars?

454
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,366
I don't even know her.

455
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,695
- Why does he owe you $40?
- He knows me very well.

456
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:00,995
Ask him.

457
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,339
Is that your green Passat?

458
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:05,196
Yeah.

459
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,308
Well we have seen you cruising around
for at least 45 minutes.

460
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,875

- and come down
- I just... I...

462
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,904
Like ten minutes ago
I was driving around.

463
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,083

- I've seen it. You know what, sir?

464
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,512
I shouldn't be talking

00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,359
Mother, stop.

941
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,531
I'm not cleaning up. I'm going to bed.

942
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,541
Come on. Come on, girl. We're here.

943
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,912
Hey, look who's back. Hi, baby.

944
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,082

945
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,581
Yeah, you're cute.
I love your sweater, your fake purse.

946
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,879
What is wrong with you?
Are you on something?

00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:04,781
Yes. I'm on. I'm gonna kick your
fucking ass if you talk to me again.

24 hours, she's already causing drama.

949

Drama!

950
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,799
You two, stay your asses here

951
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,901
Alexandra, you better watch her,
and don't move your black ass.

952
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:43,993
Girl, where you been?

What? Sin-Sin, sit your ass down.

958
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:10,022
You know, you could have at least
had the decency to come pick me up.

959
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:13,394
Who the fuck am I gonna get
to come pick you up?

960
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,392
You know, I got Nash working on Vermont.

And I'm gonna get it for you

- knew about it but me.
- Hey! I'm gonna call the cop!

995
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:08,603
You want me to call the cop?

996
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:10,505
Mamasan, I'm sorry. I'm gonna chill

Karo, do you know Razmik?

Which Razmik?

Razmik Simonian.
He is one of your drivers.

Yes. Of course. I know him very well.

1005
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,766
I need you to take me to him
right away. Please.

1006
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:40,207
Where do you think he might be?

1007
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,340
I am his mother-in-law.

1008
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:48,515
Oh. He should be around
the West Hollywood area.

1009

I will find him for you.

I told her he is not going to work.

1013
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,029
What is the matter, Auntie?

1014

1018
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:24,075
Yes, drive. It's okay.

1019
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:33,822
This thing busts in and drags me
out by my hair, tries to beat my ass,

1020
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,859
then she took me to some
boring-ass drag queen show.

1021

I ain't no motherfucking drag queen!

go crazy on her?

you were getting married?

Yes, I proposed right before
she got herself arrested.

Before I got myself arrested?

asked me to hold your teener in my weave.

01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:17,557
What do you want? Hurry up.

1091
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,349
- Do you have watermelon flavor?
- No.

1092
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:22,085
Don't you think we should be
getting the Christmas donuts?

1093
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:24,926
I mean it's motherfucking Christmas Eve.
Like, let's celebrate.

1094
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:28,092
Mamasan, does your husband
ever cheat on you?

1095
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:31,067
- Who's gonna marry her smiling ass?
- The one who order her offline.

1096
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,365
- Look how happy she is.
- Hurry up, I have another costumer.

1097
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:34,700
- OK.
- What do you want?

1098
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,884
Can you come here a second?
Just one second.

1099
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:51,788
- Hey, baby, how's it going?
- Hey. How are ya?

1100
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:53,754
I'm wonderful. Are you ready for me?

1101
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,861
Listen, have you seen Sin-Dee tonight?

1102
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:59,056
Yeah, I've seen her, baby,
she's involved in some drama,

1103
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:00,757
but I'm right here.

1104
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,434
No, no, I really need to find her,
do you know where she's at?

1105
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,200
Yeah. I know.

1106
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,273
And?

1107
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,443
And I know I need a cheeseburger.

1108
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:12,103
Jesus fucking Christ.

1109
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:16,048
Here, this is your cheeseburger.

1110
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:20,549
And some French fries.

1111
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:23,715
Where is she?

1112
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:29,762
Give me that money back.

1113
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:31,588
Here, I'm gonna give you this.
Where is she?

1114
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:33,324
She's at Donut Time.

1115
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,966
- Big spender.
- Go fuck yourself.

1116
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:40,964
At the Long Beach Barbeque Festival,

1117
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,836
you said I was the only girl
you ever truly loved.

1118
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:44,010
That's true.

1119
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:49,406
You know, people who love people,
don't go fucking other people, Chester.

1120
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:51,642
Shit, I did not motherfucking
cheat on you.

1121
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,117
I'm a businessman, alright?
I move product.

1122
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:57,257
That's what I do. Alright, sometimes
I gotta test the merch is all.

1123
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:59,153
- How many times did he fuck you?
- Don't answer that.

1124
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,760
- How many times?
- He fucked me plenty, okay?

1125
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,828
- How many?
- What is fucking wrong with you?

1126
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:07,930
Ten? Like, I never had a pimp
who didn't fuck me.

1127
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:10,434
So you had to check
your merchandise ten times, Chester?

1128
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:13,139
Alright, listen.
Not another word from you.

1129
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:14,364
You shut your fucking mouth.

1130
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:23,381
Twenty eight days and you mean to tell me
nobody was taking care of you? Nobody?

1131
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:24,710
- Nobody.
- Nobody?

1132
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:25,885
Nope.

1133
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:27,145
(SPEAKING ARMENIAN)

1134
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,914
Auntie, are you sure you want
to keep looking?

1135
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:31,756
What was your name again?

1136
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:33,187
Karo.

1137
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:40,561
Karo, please don't waste my time.
Take me to Razmik.

1138
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:44,827
Chester, I was at Twin Towers,
not fucking Wasco State Prison.

1139
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:47,905
You really do have a crush, don't you?

1140
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,075
Hi, Rizuku!

1141
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:52,645
(SPEAKING ARMENIAN) Okay, I will take you
to your son-in-law. But do you know why?

1142
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:55,115
Because he has to understand that
even if he does not respect himself...

1143
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:58,046
...he must respect his family.

1144
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:01,052
Shit floats to the surface.

1145
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,552
Sit your ass fucking down. No, no, man.

1146
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,386
She ain't fucking available.

1147
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,324
She with me right now.
She ain't fucking working.

1148
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:10,895
We'll be real quick, just 15 minutes.

1149
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,031
Yeah, puppy. Just 15 minutes.

1150
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:15,927
Who are you?

1151
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:18,935
Nigga, who the fuck are you?
I'm her motherfucking fiancé.

1152
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,163
Bounce, motherfucker!

1153
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:22,706
You retired? I didn't know you retired.

1154
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:24,874
- Yes, she fucking retired.
- Why didn't you tell me you retired?

1155
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:26,944
Maybe I am available.
Maybe it'll be a freebie.

1156
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:29,376
- My cheating fiancé shouldn't mind.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1157
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:33,052
Have you ever been to Santa Monica
and Highland?

1158
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,118
Oh, I don't remember.

1159
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:36,816
You will remember.

1160
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,923
Yo, yo, yo, listen. I got a query.
You married, right?

1161
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:42,856
Nigga, you got a fucking wife.
I know you do.

1162
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:44,287
Yeah.

1163
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:47,058
Yeah. So, when you be
fucking my bitches,

1164
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,030
you don't consider it cheating, do you?

1165
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,529
I'm paying for it.
It's not like we're getting married.

1166
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:53,570
Oh, you see?
That's the shit right there.

1167
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:56,868
- That's what I'm talking about.
- You didn't pay for it, Chester!

1168
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:59,409
(SPEAKING ARMENIAN)
He's lucky he's in America.

1169
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:01,275
Imagine if he was in Armenia.

1170
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:05,074
Are you available?

There's his cab. Should I stop here?

1174
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,115
Stop. Stop. Stop.

- I don't understand.
- You said you were going to work.

at the same store you shopped at!

Did Yeva bring you here? Is she here?

01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:03,924
Hey, there is no fighting in here.

1242
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:06,532
- C'mon, get up.
- Don't touch me.

1243
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:08,257
He hurting you?
I can call the police if he...

1244
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:09,800
No, no, no. I'm not hurting her.

1245
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,097
This is my mother-in-law.
She's just a little bit crazy.

1246
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:13,295
No cops, please.

1247
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,475
- Did you hear what she said?
- ALEXANDRA: Razmik!

1248
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:18,945
"Oh, how was the performance,
Alexandra?"

"Oh, it was great. Thanks for asking."

You think the government doesn't know
about aliens and spaceships and shit?

a secret from us?

- Exactly. That's cool.
- That's right. I'm with this bitch.

- Not like that.

You are embarrassing me.

No, you are embarrassing us.

1256
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:48,371
C'mon, get up.

1257
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:51,443
What do you want from us?
Don't you feel sorry for my daughter?

1258
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:53,647
So did Mr. Falafel have a big dick?

1259
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,516
What? Spit it out.

1260
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:58,378
I didn't. I swallowed it.

1261
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:01,384
I know... I...
I fucking set that one up, didn't I?

1262
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:02,714
She's going to call the police.

1263

In front of all these people,
I'm going to rip your mask off.

Listen to me. Get up. Let's go.

1265

Are you people totally insane?
Why did you bring the baby here?

1269
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,879
Mom, what's going on here?

1270
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:30,208
Your husband is a dog. Dog.

1271

Mom, what's going on with you?

1272
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:35,922
You think I don't know?
I check your bank statements...

1273
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:37,988
Every night he withdraws cash
from your account...

1274

What does he spend it on? Them.

This is embarrassing. Please.
Let's go home.

1276
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:43,754
Mom, why are you getting involved
in my family's affairs?

1277
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:45,295
It's none of your business.

You can pretend to be blind
but I cannot.

Get up. We're going home.

1280
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,169
I'm not going to allow him
to get away with this.

Help me out, sister...

1283

When your husband goes out
and buys a girl like me,

1284
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:02,839
do you consider that cheating?

1285

Sin-Dee, can you please
not talk to my wife.

1286
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:05,880
- Sin-Dee, please...
- Get your hands off her.

1287

You even know their names? Oh, my God.

1288

These are the type of hoes you like?
Dumbass hoes like this?

He comes home every night smelling like
cheap perfume and you don't say anything.

1295
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,510
I know my husband well enough.
Come on, let's go.

Why what? What? She's been trying
to destroy our family from day one.

01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:44,987
No, you are.

1300
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:47,984
Razmik, just apologize to the bitch.

1301
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,992
Don't be a pussy, yo.
Do not apologize for shit, yo!

1302

Shut up and get out
of our business, okay?

1303
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,165
That's right, Ra-Ra.
You should apologize

1304
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,165
for taking her to
a fucked up hairdresser.

What is the prostitute saying to you?

1307

Razmik supports the family.
He takes care of us.

1308

What are you talking about?
He only takes care of himself.

(SIGHING) Look...

1396
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,634
It was only once.
It didn't mean a thing.

1397
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:33,225
Hey.

1398
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:42,538
Yeah... I have a full house.
I called in another girl.

ALEXANDRA: Please, Sin-Dee. I'm sorry.

1402
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:48,073
Great, now get the fuck out of here

01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:04,089
Now let me make my money
and go the fuck home.

1405
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:19,169
Hi, are we looking for a party...

1406
01:23:19,294 --> 01:23:20,328
- (EXCLAIMS)

Oh, my God.
They just threw fucking piss on me.

1412
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:38,387
(SPITTING) It's in my mouth.

1413
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,856
- It's in my fucking hair!
- Wait, wait.

1414
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:41,618
I don't have no fucking money
for new hair.

1415
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:51,363
Oh, my God, come on, come on.
Take this off.

1416
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:55,132
Oh, my God.

01:23:57,732 --> 01:24:00,008
You know what, why don't
I just take these off too, huh?

Oh, girl.

1423
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:01,740
Pull that down.

1424
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:05,905
We'll just be bald together.

1425
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:10,777
That actually looks good on you.

1426
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:15,248
