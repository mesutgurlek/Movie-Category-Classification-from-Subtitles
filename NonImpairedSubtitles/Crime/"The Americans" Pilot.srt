1
00:00:08,454 --> 00:00:12,359
* Cryin' on the corner,
waitin' in the rain *

2
00:00:12,427 --> 00:00:16,368
* I swear
I'll never, ever wait again *

3
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:18,603
* you gave me your word *

4
00:00:18,671 --> 00:00:24,011
* but words for you are lies *

5
00:00:24,078 --> 00:00:25,279
* darlin'... *

6
00:00:25,347 --> 00:00:28,951
Seriously? The president?

7
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:30,286
At this level,

8
00:00:30,354 --> 00:00:33,155
there aren't that many people
he can trust.

9
00:00:33,223 --> 00:00:35,960
How do I know
you're not making all this up?

10
00:00:36,027 --> 00:00:37,696
* ...my heart *

11
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:40,999
* I'm gonna swallow my tears *

12
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:46,238
* I'm gonna turn
and leave you here *

13
00:00:46,306 --> 00:00:48,407
Oh, my God.

14
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:52,175
* All of my life
I've been waitin' in the rain *

15
00:00:52,243 --> 00:00:53,843
So handsome.

16
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:56,611
The things I'm telling you...

17
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,947
You don't joke around about.

18
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:02,117
It could be dangerous.

19
00:01:02,184 --> 00:01:05,053
Dangerous. Mm.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,121
* I'm gonna harden my heart *

21
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:11,591
* I'm gonna swallow my tears *

22
00:01:11,658 --> 00:01:16,093
You know, most people...

23
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:19,195
They get into their warm beds
at night.

24
00:01:19,263 --> 00:01:23,466
They have no idea
what really goes on out there.

25
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:26,669
The sheer number of people

26
00:01:26,737 --> 00:01:30,439
working to destroy
our way of life.

27
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:31,806
You... you know why

28
00:01:31,873 --> 00:01:35,975
I've dedicated my life
to stopping them?

29
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:38,010
Why?

30
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:40,679
Because...

31
00:01:41,914 --> 00:01:43,148
Because...

32
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:44,616
You ready for this?

33
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:46,784
Oh.

34
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:48,318
Oh.

35
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:37,621
I don't know.
Think about something else.

36
00:02:37,688 --> 00:02:41,458
Take deep breaths.

37
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:43,459
It's just...

38
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:45,595
They used to tell stories
about this guy, you know?

39
00:02:45,662 --> 00:02:47,296
He killed a lot of people.

40
00:02:47,364 --> 00:02:49,765
You know how guys like him
kill people?

41
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,434
They plan it for weeks, and
they always come up from behind.

42
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:55,369
Fighting face-to-face,
that's a different story.

43
00:02:55,437 --> 00:02:57,738
I heard once
he got in a bar fight

44
00:02:57,805 --> 00:02:59,539
with the entire
Japanese olympic judo team.

45
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:02,242
Took out four of 'em
before the rest of 'em ran.

46
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:04,877
Which year?
Because '64 to '72 were pussies.

47
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:06,279
They didn't even medal.

48
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:15,654
I need to look out
your living room window

49
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:17,455
for a few minutes.

50
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:27,264
Time?

51
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,465
Minus 22.

52
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:30,234
No, what time is it?

53
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:31,935
Um... It's 9:15.

54
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,239
Mm. The capitals are in L.A.,
start soon.

55
00:03:35,307 --> 00:03:36,574
You follow the NHL?

56
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:37,775
I like football.

57
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,044
She's in.
Third floor, three east.

58
00:03:55,593 --> 00:03:57,561
He's at the corner.

59
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,580
Immigration!
We just want to talk!

60
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:53,583
Help! Help!

61
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:55,718
Help!

62
00:04:55,786 --> 00:04:58,454
Don't get too close!

63
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,495
Watch the corner!

64
00:05:06,063 --> 00:05:08,164
Ugh!

65
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:22,846
* Tusk *

66
00:05:34,894 --> 00:05:36,628
* tusk *

67
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:46,573
* Tusk *

68
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,413
I know you're not
supposed to kill me.

69
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,249
I don't think you understand
how unpopular you are.

70
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,618
I could deliver you
in a hundred pieces.

71
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,787
They'd give me
a separate medal for each one.

72
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,734
He's not police! He's not police!
He's not police!

73
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,736
- You have the right to remain silent!
- He's not really police!

74
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,939
- Help! Call for help! Call for help!
- Anything you say and do will...

75
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,108
can and will be used against you
in a court of law!

76
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,543
Ohh!

77
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:11,397
* Why don't you tell me
who's on the phone? *

78
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,139
Hey, hey! Keep your eyes open.

79
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:30,147
All right. It's okay.
Deep breaths.

80
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:37,288
Look at me. Rob? Rob?

81
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,762
Keep your eyes on me.

82
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,519
Heavy bleeding,
he's got 10, 15 minutes.

83
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,054
Arlington Methodist,

84
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:09,756
then 66 to the beltway
to the drop site?

85
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,157
No, we blew our whole window
on the chase.

86
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:12,425
We won't make it.

87
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,960
So? Parkway to the beltway.

88
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:15,295
He dies, and 50/50
we miss the hand off anyway.

89
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:17,264
No, the mission comes first!

90
00:08:17,332 --> 00:08:19,133
I can help you.
I can make you rich.

91
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:20,701
Shut up!

92
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,288
You go in a John Doe.

93
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:41,923
If you live,
do not go back to Boston.

94
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,491
Assume they're on you.

95
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,594
All right?
You got to walk from here.

96
00:08:45,661 --> 00:08:47,529
You were trained
to surmount any obstacle.

97
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:49,330
Go!

98
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:03,245
* Don't say that you love me *

99
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:07,950
Back is clear.

100
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:09,585
Time?

101
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:10,886
Minus 7.

102
00:09:10,954 --> 00:09:12,188
There's another way, please.

103
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:14,223
Listen to me.
We can all sit down...

104
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,991
Shut up!

105
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:19,561
* Tusk *

106
00:09:21,397 --> 00:09:23,599
* just say that you want me *

107
00:09:31,341 --> 00:09:34,076
* don't tell me that you *

108
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:36,545
* tusk *
* real savage like *

109
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:54,230
Why is everyone so punctual
in this business?

110
00:09:55,674 --> 00:10:00,735

<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

111
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:10,687
Counter Intelligence is the place
you wanna be right now Stan.

112
00:10:10,718 --> 00:10:12,986
I mean, what's it take
to rob a bank?

113
00:10:13,054 --> 00:10:14,454
Stick a couple fingers in your pocket
and say, "give me all your money"?

114
00:10:14,522 --> 00:10:15,689
In C.I, we're up against

115
00:10:15,757 --> 00:10:17,793
the most sophisticated enemy
in the world.

116
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,624
I'll tell you one good thing
about bank robbers...

117
00:10:19,692 --> 00:10:21,192
they speak English.

118
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,628
They got me in beginning Russian
four days a week.

119
00:10:23,695 --> 00:10:25,330
Ugh. You got an ear
for languages?

120
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:27,332
Ah, you know, I had a very
attractive French teacher

121
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,933
one year in high school.
I got a B-plus.

122
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:30,768
Oh, coffee.

123
00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:32,169
Ah, just what I need.

124
00:10:32,237 --> 00:10:33,671
We getting started soon,
there, boss?

125
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:35,440
Timoshev isn't here.
He's 20 minutes late.

126
00:10:35,508 --> 00:10:37,576
Maybe he had a little too much
vodka last night.

127
00:10:37,643 --> 00:10:40,412
I have been working with him
since he defected.

128
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,781
He hasn't been 20 <i>seconds</i> late
for anything.

129
00:10:42,849 --> 00:10:44,216
Where's he coming in from?

130
00:10:44,283 --> 00:10:45,717
I don't know.

131
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:47,452
He only deals with the director
and the A.G.

132
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,087
I don't even know
where he stayed last night.

133
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,626
Mormon.

134
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:55,027
Since Reagan got elected,

135
00:10:55,095 --> 00:10:56,795
he starts these meetings
at 7:00 A.M.

136
00:10:56,863 --> 00:10:58,664
Reagan's not a mormon.

137
00:10:58,731 --> 00:11:00,799
Fundamentalist, whatever.
The goal is the same...

138
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:03,135
to wear down the enemy by
waking up earlier than they do.

139
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:06,738
Who's Timoshev?

140
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:08,073
He's this ex-KGB colonel.

141
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:09,441
Blew the whistle

142
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:11,344
on these Directorate "S"
undercover agents

143
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:13,246
supposedly hiding
all over the U.S.

144
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:14,548
Super-secret identities...

145
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:16,283
no one has any idea
who they are.

146
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,851
What, you don't buy it?

147
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,286
There's not a single piece
of evidence.

148
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:21,623
Look. You get these guys
like Timoshev, right?

149
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,124
They come over.

150
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:24,693
They get these huge
resettlement packages.

151
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,628
We're talking
millions of dollars.

152
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:28,496
So, they say things to us
to justify it.

153
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,365
They make up stories
to make us happy.

154
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:32,333
Super-secret spies
living next door.

155
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,935
They look like us, they speak
better English than we do.

156
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:36,271
According to Timoshev,

157
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:38,474
they're not allowed to say a single
word in Russian once they get here.

158
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,310
I mean, come on. Someone's been
reading too many spy novels.

159
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:43,746
We're talking figment
of the imagination.

160
00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:47,484
You understand
you make any noise,

161
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:49,152
I will kill you immediately.

162
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:56,793
FBI paid me $3 million
when I came over

163
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:59,329
and more since as a consultant.

164
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:01,198
You can get twice that!

165
00:12:01,265 --> 00:12:06,003
$3 million
as the most valued of defectors,

166
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:12,543
a Directorate "S" officer.

167
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:16,914
Another $3 million
for returning me.

168
00:12:16,982 --> 00:12:20,318
Just go to the FBI
and tell them...

169
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:30,461
Car won't start!

170
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:33,297
We're gonna have to take the bus
to the Metro.

171
00:12:33,365 --> 00:12:34,965
- Oh, dad.
- Yeah?

172
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:37,401
Maruk got two goals and an
assist last night versus L.A.

173
00:12:37,469 --> 00:12:38,736
Did they win?

174
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:40,004
Uh, no. It was a tie.

175
00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:41,606
I'm not going in today,

176
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:43,441
so you're gonna have to handle
Portland rotary

177
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:45,410
and call Swissair.

178
00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:48,581
Do you know how much
they paid that asshole?

179
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:50,015
$3 million.

180
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,650
Henry was looking
for his skateboard.

181
00:12:51,718 --> 00:12:52,952
It's not in the garage, is it?

182
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,087
No.

183
00:12:57,524 --> 00:12:59,692
- Let's go, Henry.
- Huh?

184
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:04,129
- Bye.
- Bye.

185
00:13:04,196 --> 00:13:05,564
Bye, guys.

186
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:07,900
What, no coffee for you?

187
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,368
Uh, no, thanks.

188
00:13:12,638 --> 00:13:14,273
We have to get rid of him
tonight.

189
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,441
I just coded the message,
I'll drop it on the way to work.

190
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:18,844
You don't have to stay here.
He's secure in there.

191
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:20,646
There were witnesses.
If they figure it out,

192
00:13:20,714 --> 00:13:23,015
I mean, they could be looking
for him in a couple of hours.

193
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,518
- I'm gonna stay. - Yeah, told
you... we should have built

194
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:27,854
that secret underground chamber
in the basement.

195
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:29,289
You mean the wine cellar

196
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:31,291
you wanted to put in
under the laundry room?

197
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:32,992
I did say
it could have other uses.

198
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,796
Anyway, $3 million?

199
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:40,433
He can buy himself
a diamond-plated coffin.

200
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:08,529
1-7. Show me on this location.
Show me canvassing.

201
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,465
Multiple callers,
unknown direction of flight.

202
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:13,334
What do you got?

203
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:15,369
I got a female witness.

204
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:17,270
She saw a guy
knock the victim down,

205
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:19,006
grab the purse,
and run this way.

206
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:22,543
Give me that, uh... description
one more time, please.

207
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,245
We didn't get
a full description.

208
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:27,014
Male Caucasian, black hair,
unknown complexion, unknown age.

209
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:28,349
All right,
if you do have a victim,

210
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,417
have them respond
to this location...

211
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:32,520
north end of Dupont Circle.

212
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:34,021
All right, did you
notify Parks?

213
00:15:27,545 --> 00:15:29,079
Again.

214
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:40,190
Harder. Focus.

215
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,430
Yeah.

216
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:48,632
Okay. Again.

217
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,767
So, what we have?

218
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:52,603
Captain...

219
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,405
I did not know you are back.

220
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:56,607
You two are working late.

221
00:15:56,675 --> 00:15:58,142
She has great promise.

222
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,177
We are putting in extra work.

223
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:15,393
Leave us.

224
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:17,562
I will teach her how we do it
in the field.

225
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,468
Go.

226
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,707
Now, my dear...

227
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:35,079
again.

228
00:16:45,257 --> 00:16:47,759
I am sorry, Captain.

229
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:49,126
<i>I'm</i> sorry.

230
00:16:49,194 --> 00:16:50,461
Use the contraction.

231
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:53,264
I'm sorry.

232
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:55,933
Now... faster.

233
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,637
Ugh!

234
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:01,338
Watch!

235
00:17:01,406 --> 00:17:05,511
Don't overcommit.

236
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:22,861
Nyet!

237
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:59,062
Remember me, Captain?

238
00:18:12,912 --> 00:18:13,977
How's the game?

239
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:15,880
Uh, Jughead is
in serious trouble.

240
00:18:15,948 --> 00:18:19,217
Okay, well, do some reading
and some stirring for me, okay?

241
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:21,519
- Paige, what are you working on?
- Social studies...

242
00:18:21,587 --> 00:18:24,990
a paper on how the Russians
cheat on arms control.

243
00:18:25,057 --> 00:18:28,460
Hmm.
That's, uh, Henrickson, right?

244
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:30,095
- Yep.
- Yeah.

245
00:18:30,163 --> 00:18:32,464
I don't know how
you can look at him all day

246
00:18:32,532 --> 00:18:33,999
with that... that harelip.

247
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:36,568
Mom, that's his handicap.

248
00:18:39,305 --> 00:18:41,639
So, what's the trouble
with these guys?

249
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:44,609
Well, Betty and Veronica
were hosting a charity drive,

250
00:18:44,676 --> 00:18:45,943
- and...
- Yeah?

251
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:47,745
- So Jughead...
- I'm home!

252
00:18:47,812 --> 00:18:49,180
- Oh, dad!
- Yeah?

253
00:18:49,247 --> 00:18:51,549
We launched
our rocket today in science.

254
00:18:51,616 --> 00:18:53,951
- Wow! Was it manned or unmanned?
- Unmanned.

255
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:56,120
But tomorrow, we're gonna give
Commander Stafford a plaque

256
00:18:56,187 --> 00:18:57,354
to commemorate the mission.

257
00:18:57,422 --> 00:18:59,757
Well, I'm sure
he'll be very honored.

258
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:01,092
Go look out the window.

259
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:09,201
I made the drop in the park.
No response.

260
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:11,404
Maybe he can move in with us
permanently.

261
00:19:11,472 --> 00:19:13,539
I can fix up
the spare bedroom for him.

262
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:16,510
I have a meeting later.
We'll know more then.

263
00:19:17,746 --> 00:19:19,380
Holy shit!

264
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:20,981
That's the coolest car ever!

265
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:22,282
Henry! Language!

266
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,251
Don't fall in love with it.

267
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:26,854
It's only a rental
until the Oldsmobile gets fixed.

268
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:28,790
I said that word once, and
you guys grounded me for a week.

269
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:36,164
Whenever you're ready.

270
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:37,798
Here we go.

271
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:39,233
Dad's gonna start this up
right here, right now.

272
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:42,937
Ice-cream Olympics.
Take your time.

273
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:45,139
- Eyes on the cone.
- Be the cone.

274
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:47,242
Eyes... eyes on the cone.
Don't feint too early.

275
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:50,312
Don't feint too early.

276
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,648
Know your distance.
Know your distance.

277
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:57,619
Oh, no!

278
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:02,423
All right, Henry, you're up.

279
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:03,925
War... paint.

280
00:20:03,993 --> 00:20:05,360
Here we go.

281
00:20:05,428 --> 00:20:07,629
War paint.
Let me see your war face.

282
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:09,631
Spike it.

283
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:11,933
Eyes on the cone.

284
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:14,302
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

285
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,703
Ease up. Remember the training.

286
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:17,305
Ohh!

287
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:19,708
The big nose cone!

288
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:21,176
- Mom, you're up.
- No, thanks.

289
00:20:21,244 --> 00:20:23,411
Come on. Just a... just a...

290
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:24,646
I don't want... no, thanks.

291
00:20:24,714 --> 00:20:26,047
Little one?
Come on. Let's see. Ohh!

292
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:32,187
- Sorry.
- Stop.

293
00:20:32,255 --> 00:20:34,456
Maybe we can have a Checkers
round-robin when we get hone?

294
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,658
Um, I'm just dropping
you guys off.

295
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:38,727
I got to...
got to meet a client.

296
00:20:38,795 --> 00:20:40,996
Why are you meeting
a client so late?

297
00:20:41,064 --> 00:20:43,231
He's coming in on a late flight
and wants to grab a drink.

298
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:45,600
You know, that's what business
is all about, honey.

299
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:47,368
Anyone can make
travel arrangements,

300
00:20:47,436 --> 00:20:50,004
but you keep
the executives happy,

301
00:20:50,072 --> 00:20:51,706
you keep the accounts.

302
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:28,543
How have you been, Martha?

303
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,879
Fine, Clark.
Would you like to come in?

304
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,318
So, referencing
our meeting this evening...

305
00:21:36,386 --> 00:21:39,021
obviously, you understand
it's been classified Top Secret

306
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:40,589
by the the Internal
Affairs Division

307
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:42,190
of the Committee to oversee

308
00:21:42,258 --> 00:21:45,160
United States'
counterintelligence agencies.

309
00:21:45,228 --> 00:21:46,561
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

310
00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:48,831
- et cetera, et cetera?
- I do.

311
00:21:48,898 --> 00:21:53,001
Great. So, big day
at FBI Counterintelligence?

312
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:54,369
Yes, it was.

313
00:21:54,437 --> 00:21:55,737
Obviously, we know most of it,

314
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:57,573
but I just want to hear
the details from you,

315
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,008
because a crisis
can provide an opportunity

316
00:22:00,076 --> 00:22:01,510
to uncover the leaks

317
00:22:01,578 --> 00:22:03,912
that we have been looking for
in your office.

318
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,882
So just tell me what you saw.

319
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,551
Thank you.

320
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,220
Well...

321
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:14,323
I-I know
that a man was kidnapped.

322
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,726
He was supposed to speak
at a conference this morning,

323
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,994
but he didn't show.

324
00:22:19,062 --> 00:22:20,462
Mm-hmm.

325
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,797
And did there appear to be
a centralized response

326
00:22:21,865 --> 00:22:23,131
to the kidnapping?

327
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:25,867
They were
in the secure vault all day.

328
00:22:25,935 --> 00:22:27,569
Did you get a look inside
this time?

329
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:32,340
They don't let me in there.
And you know that.

330
00:22:32,408 --> 00:22:33,641
I know. I'm sorry.

331
00:22:33,709 --> 00:22:36,979
Please go on.

332
00:22:37,046 --> 00:22:39,682
Um...

333
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:43,152
well, the man that
they kidnapped was Russian.

334
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,823
He was someone very important
in the KGB, I think.

335
00:22:46,891 --> 00:22:48,992
- Right.
- By early afternoon,

336
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,796
they had tied it to a police
report in northeast D.C.

337
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:55,900
about a man who was kidnapped
last night.

338
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:57,835
And they have
a vehicle description,

339
00:22:57,903 --> 00:23:00,137
'77 Oldsmobile, gold,

340
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:04,175
with D.C. plates
and bumper stickers.

341
00:23:04,243 --> 00:23:06,444
And descriptions
of the kidnappers?

342
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:08,112
Two men and a woman.

343
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,916
One of the men...
average height with dark hair.

344
00:23:11,984 --> 00:23:16,887
And what specific actions
did Agent Bartholomew order?

345
00:23:16,955 --> 00:23:20,858
Extra agents were sent
to surveil the Soviet embassy,

346
00:23:20,925 --> 00:23:24,828
agents went out to all the ports
and train stations.

347
00:23:24,896 --> 00:23:26,864
They thought the Russians

348
00:23:26,931 --> 00:23:28,866
would take the man
out of the country.

349
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:31,502
How would you best describe
Agent Bartholomew's mood?

350
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,003
Angry?

351
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:35,440
Um...

352
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:37,542
but I-I don't want to get him
in trouble.

353
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,477
No, no, no, no. Not at all.

354
00:23:42,782 --> 00:23:44,382
Our counterintelligence units,

355
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:47,919
they safeguard the security
of our nation, Martha.

356
00:23:47,986 --> 00:23:51,322
So, we have to safeguard
<i>their</i> security.

357
00:24:33,232 --> 00:24:35,067
<i>Tell me what you want next.</i>

358
00:24:35,135 --> 00:24:37,103
<i>Oh. I don't know.</i>

359
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,971
<i>How about... this?</i>

360
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,841
Oh, I... oh, I don't know.
<i>I don't... oh!</i>

361
00:24:41,908 --> 00:24:44,310
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

362
00:24:44,411 --> 00:24:46,279
You mean to tell me

363
00:24:46,347 --> 00:24:48,781
<i>a girl never put her finger</i>
<i>up your ass before?</i>

364
00:24:51,785 --> 00:24:53,719
<i>That's right.</i>

365
00:24:53,787 --> 00:24:55,621
<i>Yeah, yeah. Now you got it.</i>

366
00:24:55,688 --> 00:24:56,922
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

367
00:24:58,691 --> 00:25:00,892
<i>Oh, God.</i>

368
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,763
<i>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh!</i>

369
00:25:06,699 --> 00:25:08,434
<i>There's something...</i>

370
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:12,504
<i>I mean, if I... if I were</i>
<i>gonna see you again...</i>

371
00:25:12,572 --> 00:25:15,974
<i>I'd want you to be a little...</i>

372
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:18,244
<i>What?</i>

373
00:25:18,311 --> 00:25:21,346
<i>I don't want to hurt</i>
<i>your feelings.</i>

374
00:25:21,414 --> 00:25:22,647
<i>Tell me.</i>

375
00:25:22,715 --> 00:25:26,184
<i>But just maybe...</i>

376
00:25:26,252 --> 00:25:28,286
<i>Stronger, maybe?</i>

377
00:25:32,858 --> 00:25:36,760
<i>Do you know what the KGB is?</i>

378
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:39,163
<i>Um... I've heard of them.</i>

379
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,965
<i>Well...</i>

380
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:46,870
<i>Well, this weekend,</i>
<i>I am giving $100,000 cash</i>

381
00:25:46,938 --> 00:25:50,508
<i>to a KGB defector</i>
<i>who's coming to town to...</i>

382
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:04,335
The Reagan administration
revealed today

383
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,094
<i>that after a month-long review,</i>

384
00:26:06,162 --> 00:26:07,829
<i>it will honor the agreement</i>
<i>with Iran</i>

385
00:26:07,897 --> 00:26:10,165
<i>that led to the release</i>
<i>of the 52 American hostages.</i>

386
00:26:10,232 --> 00:26:13,802
So...

387
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:16,972
FBI have the car description
with the D.C. plates.

388
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,674
They haven't connected it

389
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:21,877
to a stabbing victim
at Arlington Methodist yet,

390
00:26:21,945 --> 00:26:24,246
but I don't think
it will be long.

391
00:26:24,314 --> 00:26:26,148
They're all over our guys
at the embassy,

392
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:27,784
who must have made
the surveillance,

393
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,753
which is why they can't get out

394
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,821
to pick up my message
or respond.

395
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:33,122
So, I think we have to assume,

396
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,724
with the feds
all over them like that,

397
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:38,595
they're on full operational
stand-down.

398
00:26:38,662 --> 00:26:41,497
We should just
take care of him ourselves.

399
00:26:41,565 --> 00:26:42,999
What's the rush?

400
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:45,802
On an operational stand-down,

401
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,139
we're authorized to make
our own decisions.

402
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:52,408
Yes, but why do you want
to kill him so badly?

403
00:26:52,476 --> 00:26:54,444
I want him out of my house!

404
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,313
He's putting us all in danger,

405
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,248
and they're just gonna kill him
back in Moscow anyway.

406
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,850
I think we should at least try
and finish the mission

407
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:01,986
the way it was assigned.

408
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,754
Oh, <i>now</i> you want to complete the
mission the way it was assigned?

409
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:05,556
I mean, you should have
thought of that before, Philip.

410
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:06,624
He shouldn't even be here.

411
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,425
Well, if you're
that worried about him,

412
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,261
maybe we could just defect
ourselves.

413
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:13,164
At least we'd be millionaires.

414
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,433
Hmm? We wouldn't have to worry
about going to jail

415
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,235
and leaving the kids all alone.

416
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,437
A lot of our problems
would just go away.

417
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,573
Pkew!

418
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,208
That's very funny.

419
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,283
Let's see
what we hear tomorrow.

420
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,467
You sure
you don't want to come?

421
00:27:51,535 --> 00:27:53,636
Haven't even seen
the new mall yet.

422
00:27:53,703 --> 00:27:56,271
It's a mall.

423
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:58,040
See you, ma.

424
00:27:58,108 --> 00:28:01,410
Yeah, I know, but this one has
fountains and skylights.

425
00:28:01,478 --> 00:28:03,079
Bye, mom.

426
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,988
When we went to dinner
last week,

427
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:14,024
wasn't she wearing a sweater
with a bunny rabbit on it?

428
00:28:14,091 --> 00:28:15,659
Oh, my God.

429
00:28:18,462 --> 00:28:21,230
* Playing with
the Queen of hearts *

430
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:22,932
* knowin' it
ain't really smart *

431
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,567
Really?

432
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:25,968
Just call your parents.

433
00:28:26,036 --> 00:28:27,503
Tell them you're sleeping
at Lisa's house.

434
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:30,005
Do you think I'm gonna get
in trouble?

435
00:28:30,073 --> 00:28:32,274
* Laying out another lie *

436
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:35,077
* thinkin' 'bout
a life of crime *

437
00:28:35,144 --> 00:28:37,612
* 'cause that's
what I'll have to do *

438
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,148
Thanks.
* to keep me away from you *

439
00:28:42,117 --> 00:28:45,186
* honey *

440
00:28:45,254 --> 00:28:47,922
* you know it makes you mad *

441
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,891
* why is everybody tellin'
everybody *

442
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:51,793
* what you have done? *

443
00:28:53,663 --> 00:28:55,597
* baby *

444
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:59,301
* I know it makes you sad *

445
00:28:59,368 --> 00:29:00,969
* but when they're handin' out
the heartaches *

446
00:29:01,037 --> 00:29:04,773
* you know
you got to have you some *

447
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:07,343
* playin' with
the Queen of hearts *

448
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:10,046
* knowin'
it ain't really smart *

449
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:11,848
* the joker ain't the only... *

450
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:15,819
Whoa.

451
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:17,787
I like that.

452
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:22,024
You look nice, darlin'.

453
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:23,960
You want to come with me and Dee
to shop for makeup

454
00:29:24,027 --> 00:29:25,695
after you pay for those?

455
00:29:32,469 --> 00:29:35,071
Errol, she's 13.

456
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:36,706
13?

457
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:38,608
I don't know, daddy.

458
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,677
She sure looks ready to me.

459
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,794
So long, honey.

460
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:58,363
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

461
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,198
Come on.

462
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,537
You're, uh, getting older,
so...

463
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,739
I know, I know.

464
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,508
It's... it's no use
fighting guys like that.

465
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,578
Oh, God,
I wouldn't want you to.

466
00:31:00,624 --> 00:31:03,192
You don't have to be a cowboy
to wear cowboy boots.

467
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,827
Jaden says you do.

468
00:31:04,895 --> 00:31:06,496
No one wears
cowboy boots anymore, dad.

469
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:10,666
You know, dad,
she does have a point there.

470
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,737
I met the new neighbors.

471
00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:17,139
We're gonna over later
to say hello.

472
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,215
What, do you think
I killed him?

473
00:31:26,282 --> 00:31:28,516
Just checking.

474
00:31:34,623 --> 00:31:35,957
Stop.

475
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:41,497
Stop.

476
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,740
You're my wife.

477
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,308
Is that right?

478
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,690
Oh, hi. You came!

479
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,458
Just for a second,
to, uh, bring over brownies

480
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:08,926
and welcome you
to the neighborhood.

481
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:11,295
Well, come in. Come in.

482
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:12,630
Can I offer you guys
a drink or...?

483
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:13,864
- No, no, no, no, no.
- No.

484
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,733
This place is a mess.

485
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,101
Please, please,
don't do anything.

486
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,970
We just wanted to bring over
the brownies.

487
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,038
I'm so sorry.

488
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,940
We can come over and help.

489
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:24,676
Actually, Henry can come over
all day tomorrow if you want.

490
00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:27,213
- Oh thank you. Um, this is my son Matthew.
- Hi.

491
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:29,282
Do you know
where your father is?

492
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:30,583
Uh, he's upstairs.

493
00:32:30,651 --> 00:32:32,218
What, do we have visitors
already?

494
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:33,386
Uh, yeah. This is Stan.

495
00:32:33,454 --> 00:32:35,288
Hey. Phil Jennings.

496
00:32:35,356 --> 00:32:36,823
How you doing? Stan Beeman.

497
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:38,825
Uh, my wife, Elizabeth,
Paige, Henry.

498
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:40,260
- Hi.
- Hi.

499
00:32:40,328 --> 00:32:41,562
Hey, Henry.

500
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:43,296
Hello.

501
00:32:43,364 --> 00:32:46,366
- Ooh, are those brownies?
- Homemade.

502
00:32:46,434 --> 00:32:48,369
- May I?
- Mm.

503
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:50,104
Your mom's a good cook?

504
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:51,372
Yes.

505
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:53,708
Okay.

506
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:56,511
- I should've taken them.
Thank you. - Mmm.

507
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:58,112
- Oh, that's a good brownie, hon.
- Yeah.

508
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,948
So, this is a pretty good
neighborhood we moved into, huh?

509
00:33:00,015 --> 00:33:01,683
Wouldn't live anywhere else.

510
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,085
You know? Safe, clean.
Commute to D.C.'s not too bad.

511
00:33:04,153 --> 00:33:05,920
Do you work in the city?

512
00:33:05,988 --> 00:33:07,189
I do.

513
00:33:07,256 --> 00:33:08,290
What do...
what do you do, Stan?

514
00:33:08,357 --> 00:33:10,358
I'm an FBI agent.

515
00:33:10,426 --> 00:33:16,131
FBI? Wow! What... what, do you
catch bank robbers and stuff?

516
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:18,467
Actually, I work
in Counterintelligence now.

517
00:33:18,535 --> 00:33:20,903
Counterintel... that's...
that's against spies, right?

518
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:22,004
Exactly.

519
00:33:22,072 --> 00:33:23,873
Oh. I'll have to make sure

520
00:33:23,941 --> 00:33:26,075
I don't do any spying
around here.

521
00:33:26,143 --> 00:33:28,411
Oh, you better not,
especially for those Russians.

522
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:30,246
Oh, yeah. They're the...
they're the worst, right?

523
00:33:30,313 --> 00:33:32,348
Oh, they certainly are, Philip.

524
00:33:32,415 --> 00:33:35,017
They certainly are.

525
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:46,376
It's probably a coincidence,

526
00:33:46,668 --> 00:33:49,170
FBI agents
have to live somewhere.

527
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:51,572
Or they're onto us.

528
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,374
And this is what?

529
00:33:53,441 --> 00:33:55,009
The end game.

530
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:57,244
They're... they're trying to
make us do something stupid.

531
00:33:57,311 --> 00:33:59,646
Either way, we get rid
of Timoshev tonight.

532
00:33:59,714 --> 00:34:01,715
I almost did it myself
this morning,

533
00:34:01,782 --> 00:34:03,449
but I thought you'd be pissed.

534
00:34:03,517 --> 00:34:04,951
If they are watching us,

535
00:34:05,018 --> 00:34:07,720
the last thing
you want to do is kill Timoshev.

536
00:34:07,788 --> 00:34:10,556
That's life in prison.
That's no deals, nothing.

537
00:34:10,624 --> 00:34:12,258
We take those risks every day,
Philip.

538
00:34:12,326 --> 00:34:13,359
That's what we do.

539
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:17,897
May...
maybe there's another way.

540
00:34:19,901 --> 00:34:24,238
Look, maybe this is
an... opportunity.

541
00:34:24,306 --> 00:34:27,776
Maybe this is the perfect time
for us just to think about...

542
00:34:27,843 --> 00:34:30,078
living the life
we've been living

543
00:34:30,146 --> 00:34:31,947
but just really living it.

544
00:34:32,015 --> 00:34:34,717
Just... being us.

545
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:37,587
What are you talking about?

546
00:34:37,655 --> 00:34:39,488
I'm saying we might be blown.

547
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:41,490
And I'm saying
if they are watching us,

548
00:34:41,558 --> 00:34:43,025
we can't kill Timoshev.

549
00:34:43,093 --> 00:34:46,295
I'm also saying we are
Philip and Elizabeth Jennings.

550
00:34:46,363 --> 00:34:48,897
We have been
for a very long time.

551
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:51,933
So why don't we get ahead
of this

552
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:54,569
and why don't we make
the first move

553
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:57,439
and offer ourselves to them?

554
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:58,940
We could get a lot of money...

555
00:34:59,008 --> 00:35:01,910
$3 million for Timoshev,
$3 million for us.

556
00:35:01,978 --> 00:35:05,280
We just get relocated,
take the good life,

557
00:35:05,347 --> 00:35:07,415
and be happy.

558
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,989
Are you joking?

559
00:35:14,057 --> 00:35:15,825
Is this a joke?

560
00:35:15,893 --> 00:35:18,127
No.

561
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:19,362
You want to betray our country?

562
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,730
Well, after
everything we've done,

563
00:35:20,798 --> 00:35:22,098
I don't think
it's such a betrayal.

564
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,633
Defecting to America?

565
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:27,338
America's not so bad.
We've been here a long time.

566
00:35:27,406 --> 00:35:30,341
What's... what's so bad
about it, you know?

567
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:33,010
The electricity works all the time.
Food's pretty great.

568
00:35:33,078 --> 00:35:34,645
- The closet space...
- Is that what you care about?

569
00:35:34,713 --> 00:35:36,580
- No, I care about everything.
- Not the Motherland!

570
00:35:36,648 --> 00:35:38,949
I do, but our family
comes first.

571
00:35:39,017 --> 00:35:41,285
So, Paige and Henry, uh...

572
00:35:41,353 --> 00:35:43,854
- What exactly is your plan? - We'd have
a great life because we would have money.

573
00:35:43,922 --> 00:35:45,857
What would you tell them,
Philip?

574
00:35:45,924 --> 00:35:47,124
The truth.

575
00:35:49,895 --> 00:35:51,729
You swore.

576
00:35:51,797 --> 00:35:54,565
We swore
we would never tell them!

577
00:35:54,633 --> 00:35:57,001
To let them grow up
and live their own lives.

578
00:35:57,069 --> 00:35:58,703
They're not to be
a part of this.

579
00:35:58,771 --> 00:36:00,204
They're not
to be a part of this.

580
00:36:00,272 --> 00:36:02,139
They will be American,
and you can't stand that.

581
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:03,541
I see it every day.

582
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:04,976
I'm not finished with them yet.

583
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:06,777
They don't have to be
regular Americans.

584
00:36:06,845 --> 00:36:09,213
- They can be socialists.
- They're not gonna be socialists.

585
00:36:09,281 --> 00:36:11,049
- They can be trade-union activists.
- This place doesn't turn out socialists.

586
00:36:11,116 --> 00:36:12,683
To know that it was all a lie?

587
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:14,818
They would never speak to us
again, Philip.

588
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:16,620
And what are we even
talking about?

589
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:18,088
There would be no future
for any of us.

590
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:20,824
- They would kill us all!
- They'd never find us.

591
00:36:20,892 --> 00:36:22,726
- They would never find us.
- Have you looked in our trunk?!

592
00:36:22,793 --> 00:36:25,028
He was a fool.

593
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:27,196
He came back to give speeches.

594
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,398
Left clues
about where he was staying.

595
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:31,967
We'd... we'd be more careful.

596
00:37:39,505 --> 00:37:41,005
Colonel.

597
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:45,910
Come.

598
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,188
Philip...

599
00:37:57,256 --> 00:37:59,424
I'd like you to meet Elizabeth.

600
00:37:59,492 --> 00:38:00,792
Elizabeth...

601
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,762
this is Philip.

602
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,931
Pleased to meet you.

603
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:08,066
Likewise.

604
00:38:08,134 --> 00:38:10,002
I'll leave you two
to get acquainted.

605
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,205
There is so much to talk about.

606
00:38:12,273 --> 00:38:14,341
Your lives up until now.

607
00:38:14,408 --> 00:38:16,309
Philip and Elizabeth's lives.

608
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,712
Not the other ones...
those should never be discussed.

609
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,549
It would be easy
to believe in the Elizabeth

610
00:38:22,617 --> 00:38:25,418
who grew up in Chicago,
Illinois, Philip,

611
00:38:25,486 --> 00:38:27,387
if you don't know
any other story.

612
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:31,057
Elizabeth, you'll be less likely
to make a slip one day

613
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:33,793
if there is no other version
of this man

614
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:36,129
you're hiding away
in the back of your mind.

615
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:39,833
Please.

616
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,268
Sit.

617
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,517
Would you like some tea?

618
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:58,319
Yes. Thank you.

619
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:13,167
Please.

620
00:39:35,055 --> 00:39:36,589
Arlington Methodist.

621
00:39:36,657 --> 00:39:37,890
County liaison.

622
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,993
How can I help you?

623
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:42,128
Sergeant Vaugn,
Fairfax Sheriff Department.

624
00:39:42,196 --> 00:39:43,463
I'm looking for a John Doe...

625
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:45,231
would have come in
Thursday night.

626
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:48,802
Male Caucasian, 5'10",
knife wound to the stomach.

627
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,570
Let me look.

628
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:54,406
Oh, I'm sorry, Sergeant.
He expired that night.

629
00:39:54,474 --> 00:39:56,208
Okay, thank you.

630
00:40:09,549 --> 00:40:12,584
Hey, neighbor!

631
00:40:12,652 --> 00:40:14,686
Hey, Stan.
How's the move-in coming?

632
00:40:14,754 --> 00:40:15,754
Oh, you know,

633
00:40:15,822 --> 00:40:17,356
it's long way to go.

634
00:40:17,424 --> 00:40:19,058
- You want a beer?
- No, thank you.

635
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:21,828
But I could actually use some
jumper cables if you have them.

636
00:40:21,896 --> 00:40:24,464
My wife's car didn't quite make
the trip from St. Louis.

637
00:40:24,532 --> 00:40:26,165
Sure, come on in.

638
00:40:26,233 --> 00:40:27,233
Oh, great.

639
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:29,502
You sure no beer?

640
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,971
Oh, I'd love to, but I got
to go in to work.

641
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:34,474
You don't even get
a day off to move in?

642
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:36,142
You know, we got
this real shit storm brewing.

643
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,811
Looks like I'm gonna be
working seven-day weeks

644
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:39,446
for the foreseeable future.

645
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,553
You having car trouble?

646
00:40:47,621 --> 00:40:50,923
Oh, nothing major...
cracked PCV hose.

647
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:52,791
This is an Oldsmobile Delta,
huh?

648
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:53,792
Yeah.

649
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,827
'77?

650
00:40:54,894 --> 00:40:56,395
Mm-hmm.

651
00:40:56,463 --> 00:40:59,365
I wanted the Coupe.
She wanted the Sedan.

652
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:01,901
So we settled on this
with a V8.

653
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:05,271
Beautiful styling
with these stacked headlights.

654
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,473
GM can't make these
fast enough, huh?

655
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:10,343
Yeah, it's a great car.

656
00:41:12,046 --> 00:41:13,680
You weren't, uh, tempted

657
00:41:13,747 --> 00:41:16,015
by one of those
Japanese upstarts, huh?

658
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:18,484
I don't think I'd fit in one.

659
00:41:18,552 --> 00:41:20,253
Oh, yeah, I hear you on that.

660
00:41:27,394 --> 00:41:29,995
Oh, great. Thanks.

661
00:41:30,063 --> 00:41:31,464
You bet.

662
00:41:33,567 --> 00:41:35,735
Well, I got to get back.

663
00:41:35,803 --> 00:41:38,839
Of course. After you.

664
00:41:41,242 --> 00:41:42,342
What's it called?

665
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,078
A piroshki.

666
00:41:44,145 --> 00:41:46,347
It's like a meat dumpling.
They kind of like them.

667
00:41:46,415 --> 00:41:47,848
I kind of like them, too.
They're juicy. They're doughy.

668
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:50,351
Mr. Beeman.

669
00:41:50,419 --> 00:41:52,186
This is Agent Gaad,
my former deputy.

670
00:41:52,254 --> 00:41:53,688
How you doing?

671
00:41:53,755 --> 00:41:55,022
He's detailed

672
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,758
to a CIA Counterintelligence
task force

673
00:41:56,825 --> 00:41:58,593
at Langley.

674
00:41:58,661 --> 00:42:00,328
He's going to bring them
up to speed on Timoshev,

675
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:02,997
and hopefully
they can help us out.

676
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:04,031
Hi, Chris.

677
00:42:04,098 --> 00:42:05,599
Frank.

678
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:07,401
Agent Beeman, do you think
there's any chance

679
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:08,768
that Timoshev is still alive?

680
00:42:08,836 --> 00:42:10,670
Uh, he's been here
about 10 minutes, Frank.

681
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:13,273
Well, it's my understanding
he has some special insight.

682
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:15,475
Yeah,
my bank-robbery assignment,

683
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:17,543
the last three years,
I was undercover.

684
00:42:17,611 --> 00:42:19,579
Undercover? With who?

685
00:42:19,647 --> 00:42:21,547
A white-supremacist group
out of Southern Arkansas.

686
00:42:21,615 --> 00:42:24,183
24 principals
currently awaiting trial.

687
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:26,353
No shit. You were living it,
the whole nine yards?

688
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,822
Yeah. I barely saw my family.

689
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,158
That's one thing
we haven't had around here...

690
00:42:31,226 --> 00:42:32,593
someone with that mind-set.

691
00:42:32,661 --> 00:42:34,596
I thought you were here
for your good looks.

692
00:42:34,663 --> 00:42:36,364
On Timoshev, sir...

693
00:42:36,432 --> 00:42:38,533
when you're betrayed
by one of your own...

694
00:42:38,601 --> 00:42:40,869
Psst. Hey.

695
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:46,976
When you're betrayed
by one of your own,

696
00:42:47,043 --> 00:42:49,111
you're not inclined to put him
out of his misery fast.

697
00:42:49,179 --> 00:42:51,013
I would bet the Russians
would go to considerable lengths

698
00:42:51,081 --> 00:42:52,348
to get him back there

699
00:42:52,415 --> 00:42:53,782
so they can look him in the eye

700
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:55,617
before they blow
his brains out.

701
00:42:56,886 --> 00:42:58,620
If you grabbed him
but you couldn't get him

702
00:42:58,688 --> 00:43:00,021
out of the country right away,
where would you keep him?

703
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:01,857
Well, I wouldn't take him
to the embassy.

704
00:43:01,924 --> 00:43:03,692
I wouldn't want to get near
any Russians,

705
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,362
where we might be looking.

706
00:43:06,429 --> 00:43:09,131
Um, I wouldn't want to be
on the street,

707
00:43:09,198 --> 00:43:10,632
as much as I could avoid it,

708
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,301
or anywhere
I didn't usually go.

709
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:14,003
I would probably make a beeline

710
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:16,205
to my house,
to tell you the truth.

711
00:43:16,273 --> 00:43:18,908
It's really the safest place you
can be, strange as that may sound.

712
00:43:18,976 --> 00:43:21,644
And I would just follow
my regular routine,

713
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:24,180
keep him there
till the heat died down.

714
00:43:24,248 --> 00:43:26,315
Well, if he's at somebody's house,
we're never gonna find him.

715
00:43:26,383 --> 00:43:29,085
No, I wouldn't think so, sir.

716
00:43:29,153 --> 00:43:31,454
Well, thanks.

717
00:43:35,592 --> 00:43:36,893
So, were you, like,

718
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,828
burning crosses and shit
with those guys

719
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:40,229
or like, "Heil Hitler"?

720
00:43:40,297 --> 00:43:42,566
It was a little deeper
than that.

721
00:43:46,037 --> 00:43:49,507
Like... like what?

722
00:43:49,574 --> 00:43:53,878
Hey, dad, can we get a racing
stripe on the Oldsmobile?

723
00:43:53,946 --> 00:43:56,514
Uh, I don't think your mom
would like that.

724
00:43:56,582 --> 00:43:59,218
Why not?

725
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:02,754
She doesn't like new things.

726
00:44:02,822 --> 00:44:06,592
* The bombs bursting in air *

727
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:10,896
* gave proof
through the night *

728
00:44:10,964 --> 00:44:15,301
* that our flag
was still there *

729
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:22,641
* o say does
that star-spangled banner *

730
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:25,944
* yet wave *

731
00:44:26,012 --> 00:44:31,917
* o'er the land of the free *

732
00:44:31,984 --> 00:44:39,323
* and the home of the brave? *

733
00:44:45,497 --> 00:44:48,298
Falls Church middle school,

734
00:44:48,366 --> 00:44:51,635
please welcome
a true American hero...

735
00:44:51,703 --> 00:44:54,437
Commander of Gemini 9
and Apollo 10,

736
00:44:54,505 --> 00:44:57,040
Astronaut Thomas P. Stafford.

737
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,862
Whoo!

738
00:46:14,218 --> 00:46:15,218
Listen.

739
00:46:15,286 --> 00:46:16,486
Aah!

740
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:18,321
You're such a pain in the ass.

741
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:21,459
I'm trying to make a deal.

742
00:46:45,015 --> 00:46:48,084
Come on, we don't have
much time.

743
00:46:50,254 --> 00:46:54,457
What's going on?

744
00:46:54,524 --> 00:46:57,360
I'm taking him to our neighbor.

745
00:46:57,428 --> 00:47:00,063
- You are?
- Yeah.

746
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:01,631
I was gonna drive him out,
hand him off further from home,

747
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:03,366
but you seem to have taken
the distributor cap.

748
00:47:03,433 --> 00:47:05,234
- So you were leaving me.
- I'm gonna make a deal

749
00:47:05,302 --> 00:47:07,503
where you don't have to talk to the
Americans if you don't want to,

750
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:08,904
if you think that'll
make you a traitor,

751
00:47:08,972 --> 00:47:10,438
but you will come with me
and the kids.

752
00:47:10,506 --> 00:47:12,641
It won't be exactly what you
want, but you'll adjust.

753
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:14,409
So you're just deciding
for both of us.

754
00:47:14,476 --> 00:47:16,544
- Yeah, one of us has to.
- Why you?

755
00:47:16,612 --> 00:47:18,179
Because we're running
out of time!

756
00:47:18,246 --> 00:47:20,781
Why can't we
do things together?

757
00:47:20,849 --> 00:47:22,583
Because I am a KGB officer!

758
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:26,053
Don't you understand that,
after all these years?

759
00:47:26,121 --> 00:47:28,556
I would... I would go to jail,
I would die,

760
00:47:28,624 --> 00:47:31,660
I would lose everything before
I would betray my country.

761
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:33,895
Now I'm finishing this.

762
00:47:49,077 --> 00:47:51,712
Philip, don't!

763
00:47:54,516 --> 00:47:56,684
Come on!

764
00:48:35,592 --> 00:48:39,295
Sorry.
I never meant to hurt you.

765
00:48:39,363 --> 00:48:41,731
They let us have our way
with the cadets.

766
00:48:41,799 --> 00:48:46,069
It was part of the job...

767
00:48:46,137 --> 00:48:48,739
A perk.

768
00:48:52,578 --> 00:48:54,879
What are you
talking about?

769
00:48:54,947 --> 00:48:57,315
What are you talking about?

770
00:48:57,383 --> 00:49:00,652
How... how did you hurt her?

771
00:49:04,023 --> 00:49:05,824
How did he hurt you?

772
00:49:19,505 --> 00:49:21,874
Do what you want with him.

773
00:49:21,941 --> 00:49:25,110
Take him to the Americans,
if that's what you want.

774
00:50:23,495 --> 00:50:26,097
* I can feel it *

775
00:50:26,164 --> 00:50:30,335
* coming in the air tonight *

776
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:34,038
* oh, lord *

777
00:50:34,106 --> 00:50:37,342
* and I've been waiting
for this moment *

778
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,345
* for all my life *

779
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,747
* oh, lord *

780
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:46,284
* can you feel it *

781
00:50:46,352 --> 00:50:50,521
* coming in the air tonight? *

782
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,191
* oh, lord *

783
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,093
* oh, lord *

784
00:51:03,336 --> 00:51:06,038
* well, if you told me *

785
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:08,841
* you were drowning *

786
00:51:08,909 --> 00:51:13,379
* I would not lend a hand *

787
00:51:13,447 --> 00:51:18,284
* I've seen your face before,
my friend *

788
00:51:18,352 --> 00:51:22,289
* but I don't know
if you know who I am *

789
00:51:24,125 --> 00:51:28,862
* well, I was there,
and I saw what you did *

790
00:51:28,929 --> 00:51:33,433
* I saw it
with my own two eyes *

791
00:51:33,501 --> 00:51:36,636
* so you can wipe off
that grin *

792
00:51:36,704 --> 00:51:39,205
* I know where you've been *

793
00:51:39,273 --> 00:51:41,807
* it's all been a pack of lies *

794
00:51:45,112 --> 00:51:46,812
* and I can feel it *

795
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,216
* coming in the air tonight *

796
00:51:51,284 --> 00:51:55,221
* oh, lord *

797
00:51:55,289 --> 00:51:58,057
* well, I've been waiting
for this moment *

798
00:51:58,125 --> 00:52:01,327
* for all my life *

799
00:52:01,395 --> 00:52:03,330
* oh, lord *

800
00:52:05,433 --> 00:52:07,034
* I can feel it *

801
00:52:07,101 --> 00:52:11,572
* coming in the air tonight *

802
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,407
* oh, lord *

803
00:52:15,744 --> 00:52:18,579
* well, I've been waiting
for this moment *

804
00:52:18,647 --> 00:52:21,882
* for all my life *

805
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:25,620
* oh, lord *

806
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:29,357
* I can feel it
in the air tonight *

807
00:52:29,424 --> 00:52:31,859
* oh, lord *

808
00:52:31,927 --> 00:52:33,294
* oh, lord *

809
00:52:35,598 --> 00:52:38,801
* well, I've been waiting
for this moment *

810
00:52:38,868 --> 00:52:41,704
* for all my life *

811
00:52:41,771 --> 00:52:43,705
* oh, lord *

812
00:52:45,842 --> 00:52:47,642
* I can feel it *

813
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:51,946
* coming in the air tonight *

814
00:52:52,014 --> 00:52:54,115
* oh, lord *

815
00:52:55,818 --> 00:52:58,920
* and I've been waiting
for this moment *

816
00:52:58,987 --> 00:53:02,389
* for all my life *

817
00:53:02,457 --> 00:53:04,291
* oh, lord *

818
00:53:06,294 --> 00:53:09,896
* I can feel it
in the air tonight *

819
00:53:09,964 --> 00:53:12,265
* oh, lord *

820
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:16,003
* oh, lord, oh, lord *

821
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:19,140
* well, I've been waiting
for this moment *

822
00:53:19,207 --> 00:53:22,777
* for all my life *

823
00:53:22,845 --> 00:53:25,981
* oh, lord, oh, lord *

824
00:53:26,048 --> 00:53:29,919
* I can feel it
in the air tonight *

825
00:53:29,986 --> 00:53:32,355
* oh, lord *

826
00:53:32,423 --> 00:53:35,125
* oh, lord, oh, lord, lord *

827
00:53:35,192 --> 00:53:36,893
Good.

828
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:39,562
* I can feel it *

829
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:42,799
No, it's too swollen to hide.

830
00:53:42,867 --> 00:53:45,134
We're gonna have to clean
the trunk later.

831
00:53:45,202 --> 00:53:46,569
We made the planets.

832
00:53:46,637 --> 00:53:48,104
And which planet
did your class make?

833
00:53:48,172 --> 00:53:50,473
We made the Sun and Earth.

834
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:52,909
Sun? No, sorry.
This is the Sun.

835
00:53:52,977 --> 00:53:56,145
Well, that was the Earth,
with the Moon, of course.

836
00:53:56,213 --> 00:53:57,447
But did the Commander
land on it?

837
00:53:57,515 --> 00:53:59,649
- On the Moon?
- Yeah.

838
00:53:59,717 --> 00:54:03,186
Uh, no, he didn't land
on the Moon,

839
00:54:03,254 --> 00:54:05,522
but he got close to it.

840
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:07,357
You know,
the Moon isn't everything.

841
00:54:07,425 --> 00:54:09,960
Just getting into space is
a remarkable accomplishment.

842
00:54:11,963 --> 00:54:13,363
It's true.

843
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:15,365
You better hustle off.

844
00:54:15,432 --> 00:54:19,068
Hello?

845
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,870
I want to go to the Moon.

846
00:54:20,938 --> 00:54:24,107
Me too. That'd be awesome.

847
00:54:26,978 --> 00:54:30,914
We got a 7:30 ice time.

848
00:54:30,982 --> 00:54:33,216
What are you doing up
so early on a Sunday?

849
00:54:33,284 --> 00:54:35,385
Oh, it's these crazy shifts
I'm working.

850
00:54:35,453 --> 00:54:37,754
- I've been up since 5:00.
- Ouch.

851
00:54:37,822 --> 00:54:39,756
Yeah, I might as well
just skip sleeping altogether.

852
00:54:39,824 --> 00:54:41,492
- Right?
- How you doing, Henry?

853
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:43,694
- Good, how about you?
- Good, thanks.

854
00:54:43,762 --> 00:54:45,996
- Whoa, what happened to your neck?
- Uh, shaving.

855
00:54:46,064 --> 00:54:47,664
Two band-aids?
What are you, a butcher?

856
00:54:47,732 --> 00:54:49,333
I got to change
my blades more often.

857
00:54:49,401 --> 00:54:51,168
You know what you get your dad
next Christmas?

858
00:54:51,236 --> 00:54:52,369
What?

859
00:54:52,437 --> 00:54:54,538
- An electric razor.
- Okay.

860
00:54:54,606 --> 00:54:55,973
- Have a good practice.
- Take it easy.

861
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,942
Thanks.

862
00:55:12,425 --> 00:55:14,026
Mom?

863
00:55:14,093 --> 00:55:14,960
Yeah?

864
00:55:17,363 --> 00:55:19,398
Can we, uh, go
to the drugstore?

865
00:55:19,465 --> 00:55:21,867
Sure.

866
00:55:26,006 --> 00:55:27,574
I like that guy, Philip.

867
00:55:27,642 --> 00:55:29,076
Really? You do?

868
00:55:29,143 --> 00:55:30,677
Yeah. I do.

869
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:33,414
I mean, there's something
a little...

870
00:55:33,482 --> 00:55:35,683
I don't know, there's something a
little bit off about him, maybe.

871
00:55:35,751 --> 00:55:37,185
But I think he's a good guy.

872
00:55:37,252 --> 00:55:38,987
Something a little off?

873
00:55:39,055 --> 00:55:41,123
Yeah, I don't know. Maybe.

874
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:45,226
You know, I actually have been
feeling that, too.

875
00:55:45,294 --> 00:55:46,594
- Excuse me.
- You have?

876
00:55:46,662 --> 00:55:48,396
Yeah, I mean, you don't have
to spend three years

877
00:55:48,464 --> 00:55:50,131
with the Gold Legion
to have instincts.

878
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:51,532
It's just kind of a vibe
he gives off.

879
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,401
- Yeah.
- Right?

880
00:55:53,469 --> 00:55:54,936
You know, I was
actually feeling it

881
00:55:55,004 --> 00:55:57,472
with Bill Westerly
from the condo board, too.

882
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,941
- Did you get that from him?
- No.

883
00:56:00,008 --> 00:56:01,809
Yeah, when he was talking
about the assessments,

884
00:56:01,877 --> 00:56:03,845
I was like, this guy is
running drugs in this place.

885
00:56:03,912 --> 00:56:06,714
And the mailman, I just have
kind of instinct, is a pimp.

886
00:56:06,782 --> 00:56:09,650
- Okay, okay.
- Or something.

887
00:56:09,718 --> 00:56:12,587
- I could never really...
- Okay, y-you made your point.

888
00:56:12,655 --> 00:56:15,423
You're... honey, you're back
in the regular world, okay,

889
00:56:15,491 --> 00:56:17,359
so you need to stop
those alarm bells

890
00:56:17,427 --> 00:56:18,927
going off every 10 minutes.

891
00:56:18,995 --> 00:56:20,863
You're officially
now surrounded here

892
00:56:20,931 --> 00:56:24,900
by the most normal, boring
people in the world.

893
00:56:24,968 --> 00:56:27,402
- So enjoy it.
- Okay, we'll enjoy it.

894
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:28,437
Okay.

895
00:56:42,886 --> 00:56:44,420
* yeah *

896
00:56:50,561 --> 00:56:53,664
* ooh *

897
00:56:53,732 --> 00:56:55,633
* all right *

898
00:56:57,603 --> 00:57:01,239
* Gonna catch
a flight to Nevada *

899
00:57:01,307 --> 00:57:04,810
* leave her friends
at home in L.A. *

900
00:57:04,877 --> 00:57:08,280
* seven come eleven
or Blackjack *

901
00:57:08,348 --> 00:57:11,016
* Gamblin' night and day, yeah *

902
00:57:11,084 --> 00:57:13,485
* 'cause she's a roller, now *

903
00:57:13,553 --> 00:57:16,755
* a high-roller baby, she is *

904
00:57:16,823 --> 00:57:20,359
* mm, she's a roller, yeah *

905
00:57:20,426 --> 00:57:22,127
* a high-roller baby *

906
00:57:22,194 --> 00:57:24,929
* all right, whoo *

907
00:57:24,997 --> 00:57:28,066
No more little girls,
or I'll be back,

908
00:57:28,134 --> 00:57:29,734
and I'll stick that
in your heart.

909
00:57:29,802 --> 00:57:31,669
* Ooh, she likes to play... *

910
00:57:58,548 --> 00:58:00,415
General Zhukov.

911
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,154
Where is the traitor?

912
00:58:06,222 --> 00:58:08,924
He tried to escape.
We killed him.

913
00:58:10,894 --> 00:58:15,130
You missed the hand off.
Your comrade died.

914
00:58:15,198 --> 00:58:19,001
Now the traitor is dead
instead of in our hands.

915
00:58:19,068 --> 00:58:22,838
The Centre is worried enough
to send me here to see you.

916
00:58:22,905 --> 00:58:25,474
- General, I...
- Please sit, Elizabeth.

917
00:58:35,885 --> 00:58:37,652
Thank you.

918
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,087
The American people
have elected

919
00:58:39,155 --> 00:58:41,989
a madman as their president.

920
00:58:42,057 --> 00:58:45,660
He is expanding their military
forces on a massive scale.

921
00:58:45,727 --> 00:58:48,128
He is against
nuclear arms-control agreements.

922
00:58:48,196 --> 00:58:51,631
He makes no secret of his desire
to destroy us.

923
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:54,801
Our war is not so cold
anymore, Elizabeth.

924
00:58:54,869 --> 00:58:57,036
What happens behind enemy lines

925
00:58:57,104 --> 00:59:00,006
will determine the outcome
of this struggle.

926
00:59:00,074 --> 00:59:04,878
You reported several times
over the years about Philip.

927
00:59:04,946 --> 00:59:07,881
Can we trust him?

928
00:59:07,949 --> 00:59:12,186
Yes. I was wrong.

929
00:59:12,254 --> 00:59:13,955
It was nothing... a little...

930
00:59:14,023 --> 00:59:17,926
a phase in a person's life.

931
00:59:17,994 --> 00:59:19,261
So he is not responsible

932
00:59:19,329 --> 00:59:21,330
for the mess this mission
has become?

933
00:59:21,397 --> 00:59:23,499
I was the one
at fault, General.

934
00:59:23,566 --> 00:59:26,402
I am very sorry.

935
00:59:26,469 --> 00:59:29,071
Don't let that happen again,
Elizabeth.

936
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:32,675
I may not be able to protect you
if you need me.

937
00:59:32,743 --> 00:59:36,479
These times bring out
the worst in our people.

938
00:59:36,547 --> 00:59:38,580
I am fighting now
against comrades

939
00:59:38,648 --> 00:59:41,416
in our own organization
who are starting to act

940
00:59:41,484 --> 00:59:43,552
like they did
in our darkest days.

941
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,455
I understand.

942
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:51,694
If I am not here,
you are to fight on.

943
00:59:51,761 --> 00:59:55,298
Our enemy
is strong and capable.

944
00:59:55,365 --> 00:59:57,700
We must meet the challenge.

945
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,907
The orders are
going to change now.

946
01:00:03,974 --> 01:00:06,743
The risks
are going to be greater.

947
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,812
Your comrade who died
was a hero.

948
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,248
We are going to need
more of those now.

949
01:00:11,315 --> 01:00:14,484
We won't let you down, General.

950
01:00:20,292 --> 01:00:22,227
You were just a child.

951
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:27,800
Is there anything new in here?

952
01:00:27,867 --> 01:00:29,268
We got
a new State Police report.

953
01:00:29,336 --> 01:00:31,404
- Anything on the weapon?
- Not yet.

954
01:00:42,215 --> 01:00:45,617
Our deceased John Doe
from Arlington Methodist

955
01:00:45,685 --> 01:00:48,720
is proving very difficult
to track down.

956
01:00:48,788 --> 01:00:51,990
Either he's
a KGB directorate "S" officer

957
01:00:52,057 --> 01:00:54,592
who got killed
while kidnapping Timoshev,

958
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,862
or he's a drifter who got
stabbed in a fight in Arlington.

959
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:59,630
His picture's out

960
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:01,199
to every police department
in the country,

961
01:01:01,266 --> 01:01:03,701
- but it's a needle in a...
- Don't say "haystack."

962
01:01:03,769 --> 01:01:06,637
Mr. Deputy Attorney General.

963
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:09,140
The Attorney General and I have
just come from the White House.

964
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:11,710
President Reagan is outraged
that the KGB thinks

965
01:01:11,778 --> 01:01:14,446
it can kidnap someone
with impunity on American soil.

966
01:01:14,514 --> 01:01:18,650
The President has signed
Top Secret Executive Order 2579,

967
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:21,286
authorizing the Federal
Bureau of Investigation

968
01:01:21,354 --> 01:01:22,854
Counterintelligence Office

969
01:01:22,922 --> 01:01:25,157
to take all necessary measures
to neutralize

970
01:01:25,224 --> 01:01:27,692
Soviet Directorate "S"
sleeper-cell agents

971
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:32,163
in the continental
United States.

972
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,998
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are going to war.

973
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:37,167
It is a war that will be
fought quietly,

974
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:40,036
by the men and the woman
in this room.

975
01:01:40,104 --> 01:01:41,605
It will not be short.

976
01:01:41,673 --> 01:01:43,607
And it will not be easy.

977
01:01:43,675 --> 01:01:47,612
But we have truth and justice
on our side.

978
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:50,014
And we will prevail.

979
01:02:10,069 --> 01:02:12,938
So, why didn't you tell me
about Timoshev?

980
01:02:13,006 --> 01:02:16,375
We aren't supposed to talk
about our other lives.

981
01:02:16,443 --> 01:02:18,210
It wasn't really
your other life.

982
01:02:18,278 --> 01:02:19,611
It happened in training.

983
01:02:21,748 --> 01:02:25,551
It was a long time ago.
I put it behind me.

984
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:32,592
Things are
about to change, Philip.

985
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:37,631
It's gonna get uglier,
more dangerous.

986
01:02:44,606 --> 01:02:47,141
We'll be fine.

987
01:02:47,209 --> 01:02:50,512
Don't forget, we've been
doing this a long time.

988
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:16,706
I was born in Smolensk.

989
01:03:18,675 --> 01:03:21,544
My father died fighting
the Nazis at Stalingrad

990
01:03:21,611 --> 01:03:23,846
when I was 2.

991
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:31,453
There was a picture of him
in his uniform.

992
01:03:31,521 --> 01:03:37,393
He was pale,
with bushy eyebrows.

993
01:03:37,461 --> 01:03:40,430
He was smiling,

994
01:03:40,497 --> 01:03:43,766
although, of course,
he was going off to die.

995
01:03:47,338 --> 01:03:51,741
My mother was a bookkeeper
for the local Party Committee.

996
01:03:58,015 --> 01:04:00,249
My name is...

997
01:04:00,317 --> 01:04:04,620
was... Nadezhda.

998
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:15,764
Thank you.

999
01:04:28,911 --> 01:04:31,446
My God, the climate.

1000
01:04:31,514 --> 01:04:33,748
Yeah.

1001
01:04:35,652 --> 01:04:37,253
It's an air-conditioner.

1002
01:04:40,591 --> 01:04:42,025
Is it cold air?

1003
01:04:42,093 --> 01:04:43,193
Yeah.

1004
01:04:47,632 --> 01:04:50,534
Oh, my God.

1005
01:05:09,888 --> 01:05:11,489
I'm not ready.

1006
01:05:15,327 --> 01:05:17,828
No, I... we're...

1007
01:05:17,896 --> 01:05:20,998
supposed to be married now,

1008
01:05:21,066 --> 01:05:22,533
that's all.

1009
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:25,303
They'll expect us
to have children, eventually.

1010
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:26,704
Or... I don't know...
maybe you just...

1011
01:05:26,772 --> 01:05:29,708
maybe you just don't
find me attractive.

1012
01:05:29,776 --> 01:05:33,345
What do you think so far?

1013
01:05:33,413 --> 01:05:36,782
You know, they tell you
everything, but...

1014
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,751
I don't know...
when you see it,

1015
01:05:38,819 --> 01:05:41,154
it just seems... brighter.

1016
01:05:44,491 --> 01:05:46,893
There's a weakness
in the people.

1017
01:05:46,961 --> 01:05:48,495
I can feel it.

1018
01:07:53,014 --> 01:07:55,482
* Why don't you ask him *

1019
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:58,252
* if he's gonna stay? *

1020
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,888
* why don't you ask him *

1021
01:08:00,956 --> 01:08:06,360
* if he's going awa-a-y? *

1022
01:08:13,669 --> 01:08:16,738
* why don't you tell me *

1023
01:08:16,805 --> 01:08:19,307
* what's going on? *

1024
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:22,177
* why don't you tell me *

1025
01:08:22,245 --> 01:08:24,780
* who's on the phone? *

1026
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:27,316
* ooh, oh, oh, oh *

1027
01:08:32,585 --> 01:08:36,159
