00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,099
...qui te custodiat
ab hoste maligno,

4
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:18,169
et perducat in vitam aeternam.

5
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:19,837
Amen.

6
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,578
Asperges me, Domine, hyssopo,
et mundabor: lavabis me,

7
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:29,480
et super nivem dealbabor.

8
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:33,751
[Pope]: You are afraid
to enter, but you must.

9
00:02:33,785 --> 00:02:38,489
- ...secundum multitudinem...
- [Pope]: I am about to meet my maker.

10
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:43,894
I have confessed.
And I...

11
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:49,400
confess...
I am very afraid.

12
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:51,135
Colonna.

13
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:55,406
Sforza. Orsini.

14
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,441
Borgia.

15
00:02:57,476 --> 00:03:01,178
- Your Holiness.
- Della Rovere.

16
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:03,180
...Gloria Patri...

17
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:12,022
You will fight like dogs
over this corpse I leave

18
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:15,826
for this throne
of St. Peter's.

19
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:20,965
But it was pure once.

20
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:28,639
We have all sullied it
with our greed

21
00:03:28,673 --> 00:03:31,709
and lechery.

22
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:39,517
Which of you...
will wash it clean?

23
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:45,356
It shall be cleansed,
Your Holiness,

24
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,359
with the tears we shed for you.

25
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:50,828
I swear before the Living God.

26
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:54,398
You swear thus?
A Spanish murrano? A white moor?

27
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:56,634
- As Vice-Chancellor,

28
00:03:56,668 --> 00:04:01,372
I swear before the Living d.

29
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:05,809
- And so do I, Your Holiness.
- And I, Your Holiness. - And I.

30
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:08,179
Rest assured, Your Holiness.

31
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:14,385
The glory of our Holy Mother
Church will be restored in my lifetime.

32
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:20,824
[Pope]: Please...

33
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:22,593
...God.

34
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:32,970
[Man and woman panting
and gasping]

35
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,774
There's a door behind...
leads to the street.

36
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:12,743
The back passage?

37
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:17,881
- You're a cleric?
- Didn't you notice?

38
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,883
There was nothing
ecclesiastical about you

39
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,620
- last night.
- By night...

40
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:25,055
By night I am who I want to be.

41
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,725
By day, I am thus.

42
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,261
[Knocking]

43
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:32,129
Lucrezia!

44
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:38,569
- Sister!
- I spied a lady... another one!

45
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:40,571
There's a punishment for spying.

46
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:42,539
- What's that?
- Oh, I think you know!

47
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:45,242
No!
[Squealing and laughing]

48
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:48,279
[Laughing]

49
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:53,317
Can I come to your wedding?

50
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:55,619
I'll never have a wedding,
you know that.

51
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:58,756
No. You are betrothed to God.

52
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,360
Don't you love God, Cesare?

53
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:06,597
More than I love you?

54
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:08,399
Don't be sad, brother.

55
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:12,169
Maybe Papa will become pope,

56
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:14,505
and you can be
who you want to be.

57
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:17,808
If he does become pope,
I'll be what he wants me to be.

58
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:20,344
Can a pope have children, Cesare?

59
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:24,682
I've heard it rumoured
that Pope Innocent has 12.

60
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:28,085
But I have also heard
it rumoured that he is dying.

61
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:30,387
No news in that.
He's been dying for weeks now.

62
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:33,590
If he does die,
will our father wear his crown?

63
00:06:35,593 --> 00:06:39,029
The new pope will be elected
by the College of Cardinals, my love.

64
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:43,400
And only God can
predict the outcome.

65
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:46,270
Well, since
you will have no wedding,

66
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:48,872
I will pray for God
to choose Papa.

67
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:53,644
I want to wear a beautiful white veil
crowned with pearls for his coronation.

68
00:06:53,678 --> 00:06:56,080
God may need some help, then.

69
00:06:56,114 --> 00:07:00,551
[Bell tolling]
[Crowd speaking animatedly]

70
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:03,487
- What have they heard?
- The pope breathes his last.

71
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:05,522
God rest his soul...

72
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:12,296
[Bell tolling quietly]

73
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,331
[Muted speaking]

74
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,278
We must get you out of here
before they lock the doors.

75
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:31,348
- And so it begins.
- You know what to do?

76
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:34,184
- Yes, Father.
- Keep our family safe.

77
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:37,788
Until the new pope is elected,
it will be anarchy in Rome...

78
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:40,524
every faction fighting
for its own candidate.

79
00:07:40,558 --> 00:07:43,527
And if... after the first vote...
if the smoke is black...

80
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:47,865
As you said, Father,
I know what to do.

81
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:54,138
[Whispering]: I have waited
a lifetime for this moment.

82
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:56,673
We will go over it again.

83
00:07:56,708 --> 00:08:00,878
If we fail at the first vote,
I will send word...

84
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:02,179
On the wings of a dove...

85
00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:05,816
...names of those cardinals
who need persuading.

86
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,786
With properties, benefices,
and, if need be, gold.

87
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,021
They call it simony, Father.

88
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:13,190
God will forgive us, my son.

89
00:08:13,224 --> 00:08:16,026
But I will not forgive failure...

90
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,363
...from you
or your brother.

91
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:20,998
Am I understood?

92
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:25,102
We will not fail you, Father.

93
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,339
Mm.

94
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:34,378
Go now.

95
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:41,718
Back to Spain, Borgia!
You've had your day in Rome.

96
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:44,822
- You can't wring any more favours
from a dead pope. - I was born here,

97
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:46,824
- as far as I'm aware.
- If a pig is born

98
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:52,262
in a stable, does that make him a horse?
[Crowd laughing appreciatively]

99
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:54,498
[Man chuckling] Tsk, tsk, tsk!

100
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:56,667
Rome is for Romans now.

101
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:59,470
The new pope will see to that.

102
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:01,438
And if the new pope is Spanish?

103
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:03,807
And if my mother's
the Virgin Mary?

104
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:06,643
Was the Virgin a Roman whore?
That's news to me.

105
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:09,179
[Man grunting angrily]

106
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:12,516
[Grunting with effort]
[Crowd jeering]

107
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:16,753
[Grunting]

108
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,535
Excuse me.

109
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:34,571
- Ah!
- Ah...

110
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:37,441
My brother speaks
before he thinks.

111
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:41,078
[Man panting]
He begs your pardon.

112
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:50,954
- I should have let them do it.
- Kill me? Your younger brother?

113
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:53,790
Our father would
never have forgiven you.

114
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:10,374
Have you heard?

115
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:12,976
[Woman]: Even Gioffre has
heard. Have you not?

116
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:15,846
- [Boy]: The pope has died.
- You know what that means?

117
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,915
I know there will be an election.

118
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:20,517
And the city will be bedlam
until it's over.

119
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:23,353
[Lucrezia]: Do you think
our father can win, Juan?

120
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:25,522
[Juan]: Are we allowed
to dream, Mother?

121
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:29,860
Your father found ways to love and care
for us in this house, but I'm not sure

122
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:33,163
- as pope he can do the same.
- As pope, he can do what he wants.

123
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:34,665
Are you sure?

124
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:37,401
Kings and popes and emperors
belong to their peoples,

125
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:39,469
not to their families.

126
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:41,972
So, we allow the election
to run its course,

127
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:44,708
- and he won't be pope.
- What other course is there?

128
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:47,444
- It's in the hands of God.
- It's in the hands

129
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:52,316
of the College of Cardinals, Mother.
It's not quite the same thing.

130
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,151
This one.

131
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:03,660
- Cardinal Borgia.
- My Lord Cardinal.

132
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:08,198
- Whoever wins this contest...
- Election.

133
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:12,869
If you were a different man...

134
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:15,405
...I might vote
for you.

135
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,243
You've performed your duties
as Vice-Chancellor admirably.

136
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:22,980
The Church has need of your...

137
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:27,184
...organizational
genius.

138
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:29,152
But...

139
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:31,622
She has other needs as well.

140
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:33,290
And they would be?

141
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:36,393
Honesty.

142
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:38,695
Probity.

143
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,998
Goodness.

144
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:44,267
You find me lacking
in those qualities?

145
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:46,236
Yes.

146
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,805
And so I shall fight you.

147
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,243
To the end, and beyond that, if need
be, with any means at my disposal.

148
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:58,348
I do tend to win
whatever battles I fight.

149
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:04,121
But what talk we of fighting?

150
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:06,490
It is all in God's hands.

151
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:11,028
Good night, My Lord.

152
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:20,504
To Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia,

153
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:23,006
four votes.
[Cardinals murmuring]

154
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,842
To Cardinal Ascanio Sforza,

155
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:28,245
six votes.
[Cardinals murmuring]

156
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,515
To Cardinal Guilliano
Della Rovere,

157
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:34,418
seven votes.
[Cardinals murmuring]

158
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:37,821
To Cardinal Orsino Orsini,

159
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:39,890
six votes.

160
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:45,295
None has the require majority...

00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:47,831
[Crowd murmuring]

162
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:54,104
Dominus Deum...

163
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:57,107
After the death of Pope Sixtus,

164
00:12:57,141 --> 00:13:01,411
- they holed us up here for a month...
- Appalling.

165
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:07,451
The company was tolerable,
but as for the food...

166
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:09,720
I had to lead the revolt...

167
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:13,790
insist our dishes could be
brought in from outside.

168
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:15,525
How wise.

169
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,362
And now there's crystal
in my soup.

170
00:13:19,397 --> 00:13:21,164
Please,

171
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:23,500
have mine, Your Grace.

172
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:26,203
Oh.

173
00:13:26,237 --> 00:13:28,839
Don't drink this.
It's vinegar; I've tasted it.

174
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:30,774
[Wine spilt onto the ground]

175
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:36,646
[Whispering]: From my vineyards
in Valencia.

176
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:45,255
How can I thank you?

177
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:47,324
Hmm...
I wonder...

178
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:50,293
Mmm!

179
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:52,195
...est a me...

180
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,965
The rules are clear.
No outside contact is

181
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,967
permitted under any circumstance.

182
00:13:57,001 --> 00:14:00,470
But you must know that
Cardinal Versucci's digestion is

183
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:04,007
- very delicate.
- Which is why he has rabbit baked in milk.

184
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,343
Ah.

185
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:08,879
Good.
And...

186
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:11,281
Cardinal Piccolomini...

187
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:13,350
Uh...

188
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:16,186
Suckling pig with rosemary.

189
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,856
- Indeed. The well-being
of the curia...

190
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:23,059
...is of the greatest
importance. As Vice-Chancellor,

191
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:26,062
their health is my concern.
Mens sana in corpore sano.

192
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:28,999
I think St. Augustine might
disagree with you. He extolled

193
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:32,769
- the virtues of fasting.
- St. Augustine...

194
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:35,372
...never had to vote
in conclave.

195
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,181
My dear sons,

196
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:47,717
the Cardinals Versucci,
Piccolomini, and Sanso,

197
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:49,753
grant some titles

198
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:52,589
and benefices
from the Borgia abbeys,

199
00:14:52,623 --> 00:14:54,357
monasteries, and bishoprics.

200
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:57,394
[Cesare's voice]: ...Versucci,
Piccolomini, and Sanso,

00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:11,508
All rights to the Abbey of...

205

...St. Catherine
of Siena.

206

Cardinal Allesandro Piccolomini.

Suckling pig

208
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:21,218
for the cardinal, roasted.

209
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:23,820
Roasted and...

210
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:25,655
...stuffed.

211
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,059
- Cardinal Julius Versucci.
- Uh, rabbit.

212
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:31,494
Rabbit...

213
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,897
...baked in milk.

214
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:09,132
Tasty.

215
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:14,237
Cardinal Giuliano Della Rovere...

216
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:17,307
...has garnered ten votes.
[Cardinals murmuring]

217
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:21,444
Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, five.

218
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:26,049
Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia has
garnered eight votes.

219
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,552
But none has the required
majority.

220
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:31,588
[Cardinals murmuring]

221
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:36,393
[Doves cooing]
[Borgia]: My dear son,

222
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:39,095
we are in sight of our goal,

223
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,798
but now you must redouble
our efforts.

224
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:44,334
Send your brother
round the Borgia churches

225
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:48,471
to empty them of gold, ornaments,
and precious stone.

226
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:50,941
I have emptied the churches
of the Romagna.

227
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:53,443
I have stripped altars bare.

228
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:55,779
They were rotten
with gold ornament.

229
00:16:55,813 --> 00:16:57,747
Yes, you are
a true reformer, brother.

230
00:16:57,782 --> 00:17:00,784
These cardinals know no vows
of poverty.

231
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:07,057
[Lucrezia]: Why the dove,
Cesare?

232
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,695
It has a dual purpose, my love.

233
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:14,064
Like many things in life,

234
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:17,600
it serves as both a symbol
and a messenger.

235
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:22,105
- A symbol of what?
- Of the uncorrupted soul.

236
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:24,941
And a messenger of what?

237
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:27,210
Of corruption.

238
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:31,081
You mean to say it bears news
of how many votes

239
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:34,017
we must buy
in the Papal election.

240
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:36,086
You are criminally
well informed, sis.

241
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,989
But I trust your soul is still
of the purest white.

242
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:42,292
How many votes
must we buy him, Cesare?

243
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:44,294
You know too much already,
don't you?

244
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:47,364
You're wrong.
I know too little...

245
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:50,500
[Cesare's voice]: Dear Father,
nine mules laden down

246
00:17:50,534 --> 00:17:53,236
with gold and treasure are being
distributed

247
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,505
to the palaces
of the following cardinals:

248
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:58,641
Cardinal Giuliano Della Rovere
has garnered...

249
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:01,411
...Cardinal Ascana Sforza has
garnered four...

250
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:05,682
...Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia has
garnered ten votes.

251
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:08,151
None has the required majority.

252
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:18,028
Of course, Cardinal Sforza,
the entire conclave knows

253
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:20,530
that I cannot be both
Vice-Chancellor

254
00:18:20,564 --> 00:18:22,532
and pope of Rome.

255
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:25,668
- Than you can no longer be
a Vice-Chancellor.

256
00:18:25,703 --> 00:18:27,604
You mean...

257
00:18:27,638 --> 00:18:30,473
...I may yet be
pope of Rome?

258
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:34,978
- If you can find
a suitable Vice-Chancellor.

259
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:39,049
And how would you describe
the qualities necessary

260
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,585
for a suitable Vice-Chancellor,
Cardinal Sforza?

261
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:46,823
- Discretion.
- Mm-hmm.

262
00:18:46,857 --> 00:18:49,225
Loyalty.

263
00:18:51,228 --> 00:18:53,730
And a certain kind of wisdom.

264
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:58,101
Can you be more specific?

265
00:19:00,104 --> 00:19:02,305
I would say
the one who would be suitable

266
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:08,111
as Vice-Chancellor would be wise to support
the Vice-Chancellor who would be pope.

267
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:11,714
Hmm.

268
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:17,854
And I would say...

269
00:19:17,888 --> 00:19:20,056
...we have an understanding.

270
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:27,163
Cardinal Giuliano Della Rovere
has garnered seven votes.

271
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:32,769
Cardinal Alberto Colonna, two.

272
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:36,039
Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia...

273
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:38,341
...fourteen.
[Excited murmuring]

274
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:42,745
Cardinal Borgia has
the required majority.

275
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,883
Correction:
Cardinal Borgia has bought

276
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,385
the required majority.

277
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,822
What is your implication?

278
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:55,792
His implication is that
the throne of St. Peter's is

279
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:57,794
- for sale.
- And has been bought

280
00:19:57,828 --> 00:20:00,463
by a Spaniard
up to his elbows in simony.

281
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:02,799
I see.

282
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,301
You would prefer it had been
bought by an Italian?

283
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:09,839
By someone remotely worthy
of the papacy at least...

284
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:13,610
Then my first act
as pope will be to institute

285
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:15,945
an inquiry
into the elective process.

286
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,915
My second, of course...

287
00:20:18,949 --> 00:20:23,386
...will be to appoint
a Vice-Chancellor...

288
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,657
the greatest office,
with the greatest income,

289
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:29,392
in my gift.

290
00:20:29,426 --> 00:20:33,229
Now, there are
two obvious choices:

291
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:35,865
Cardinals Della Rovere
and Orsini.

292
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,636
But the pope could
not possibly appoint one

293
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,906
who questioned his right
to be pope.

294
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,908
That was not my intention.

295
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:48,278
[Chuckling]
Nor was it mine.

296
00:20:48,312 --> 00:20:51,414
I see.

297
00:20:51,448 --> 00:20:56,152
And the Spanish race is closest
to your bosom.

298
00:21:02,993 --> 00:21:07,063
- Can we proceed, then?
- To conclude:

299
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:09,966
Cardinal Borgia has the required
majority.

300
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,139
An examination, testes
et pendentes, is required.

301
00:21:16,173 --> 00:21:20,510
And Cardinal Borgia is happy
to comply.

302
00:21:32,122 --> 00:21:35,558
Can there be any doubt
that the good cardinal is male?

303
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:37,560
Not if we count his children.

304
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:40,563
Let him without children cast
the first stone.

305
00:21:40,598 --> 00:21:42,398
I have heard rumours...

306
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:45,435
- ...of a rhinoceros horn.
- Ooh, that small?

307
00:21:45,469 --> 00:21:47,737
Boasting again?
[General chuckling]

308
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:50,273
[Borgia clears his throat]

309
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:16,232
Oh, go on.
The suspense is killing them.

310
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:24,874
Habet duos testiculos...

311
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:28,711
...et bene pendentes.
[Applause]

312
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:31,214
So, he's got two testicles,
well hung.

313
00:22:31,248 --> 00:22:33,149
Deo gracias.

314
00:22:33,183 --> 00:22:35,918
[Crowd murmuring]

315
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:39,756
[Bells ringing]
[Applause and cheering]

316
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:47,530
[Bells ringing]

317
00:22:47,564 --> 00:22:50,166
[Cheering continues]

318
00:23:28,405 --> 00:23:32,408
Habemus papam!

319
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:34,444
[Cheering]

320
00:23:50,527 --> 00:23:56,332
[Borgia]: Pater, et filius,
et Spiritus Sanctus.

321
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:58,868
Amen.

322
00:23:58,902 --> 00:24:03,072
...tu es et dominus eternum...
[Pleasurable moaning]

323
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:07,610
...et Spiritus Sancti.
[Laughing]

324
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:09,812
Amen.
Oh!

325
00:24:12,816 --> 00:24:16,853
Your sins are all forgiven,
sisters.

326
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:20,123
[Laughing]
By the pope's bastard?

327
00:24:20,157 --> 00:24:23,226
Son!
His favourite son!

328
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,761
[Gasping]

329
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:33,770
[Cesare]: I ask to confess
to you, Holy Father,

330
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:38,274
because...
I have sinned.

331
00:24:38,308 --> 00:24:40,610
How have you sinned, my son?

332
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:43,613
I have corrupted my soul.

333
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:46,082
I have pledged estates, castles,

334
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:48,451
benefices
to your brother cardinals.

335
00:24:48,485 --> 00:24:54,223
I have transferred the documents in the
innards of roasted beasts and fowls.

336
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:57,126
All to secure
your election as pope.

337
00:24:57,161 --> 00:25:00,430
And God will repay us tenfold.

338
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:05,568
But you must set my soul
at ease, Father.

339
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:10,339
Can a family such as ours
survive such a prize?

340
00:25:10,374 --> 00:25:13,609
We are Spaniards.
They hate us.

341
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:18,948
The enemies we have at present
will be multiplied tenfold.

342
00:25:18,982 --> 00:25:21,751
God will protect his Vicar
on Earth, Cesare,

343
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:26,556
- and those dearest to him. - And will you
inform God as to His duties in this regard?

344
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:30,426
Why this blasphemous tone,
my son?

345
00:25:30,461 --> 00:25:33,830
Because I swear, if God
does not protect us, I shall.

346
00:25:33,864 --> 00:25:37,133
You are a bishop, Cesare.
You have no need of such temporal thoughts.

347
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:39,669
You placed this collar
round my neck, Father.

348
00:25:39,703 --> 00:25:41,838
You made God my calling.

349
00:25:41,872 --> 00:25:46,108
But the sins I've committed for
you must convince you, surely,

350
00:25:46,143 --> 00:25:49,645
that the Church is
not my calling.

351
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:55,184
I beg you now to release me of my vows.
Let me live as a layman.

352
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:57,420
As a soldier.

353
00:25:57,454 --> 00:26:00,957
I can then protect our family from the
storm that surely must engulf it.

354
00:26:00,991 --> 00:26:05,061
You are my eldest son, Cesare. You were
always destined to be a prince of the Church.

355
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:08,631
I would be a prince of state,
Father, and I think you know that.

356
00:26:08,665 --> 00:26:12,068
The papal army is small, Cesare.

357
00:26:12,102 --> 00:26:16,072
The battles I will fight will be
within these sacred walls.

358
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:19,842
This is where I will need
your help. Juan can...

359
00:26:19,877 --> 00:26:23,579
...bear arms for the Borgia family, and
lead whatever army the pope has,

360
00:26:23,614 --> 00:26:26,282
and I will not have my authority
questioned further on this.

361
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:31,120
Ego te absolvo ab omnibus
censuris, et peccatis,

362
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:36,359
in nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

[Swords clashing]
[Grunting with effort]

364
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:55,177
You think it fits me, brother?

365
00:26:55,212 --> 00:26:57,713
You have broad shoulders.

366
00:26:57,748 --> 00:26:59,715
As have you.

367
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,118
Though it lacks an insignia.

368
00:27:02,152 --> 00:27:04,720
I thought a cape
to cover the breastplate,

369
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:06,889
with the Borgia Bull
in bright yellow.

370
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:09,592
I favour black, myself.

371
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:12,728
Black for the cleric,
but for the soldier,

372
00:27:12,763 --> 00:27:14,830
a prancing bull in yellow.

373
00:27:14,865 --> 00:27:18,234
Or red, perhaps?

374
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:20,603
Black.

375
00:27:20,637 --> 00:27:23,072
It suits you.

376
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:37,587
[Giggling]

377
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:41,157
- Welcome, Papa.
- Oh, I've missed you.

378
00:27:41,191 --> 00:27:44,160
- [Woman]: So, you have won.
- Yes, I've won.

379
00:27:44,194 --> 00:27:46,862
You've won
what you always wanted.

380
00:27:46,897 --> 00:27:48,898
My congratulations.

381
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:54,203
And I have...
lost.

382
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:57,373
- But what have you lost, my love?
- You.

383
00:27:57,407 --> 00:27:59,842
You'll never lose me.

384
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:04,780
[Bell tolling]
In spirit, maybe, but...

385
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:07,650
in the flesh, I may have to.

386
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:09,785
The pope cannot love?

387
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,021
The pope can love God.

388
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:14,790
But to be seen
to love anyone else would be...

389
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:17,526
...unthinkable.

390
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:21,764
So we'll find ways
to accommodate our affections.

391
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:24,967
Something like we've always done.

392
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:30,206
All of Rome knows you're
the mother to my children.

393
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,877
Not only must the pope be chaste;
he must be seen to be chaste.

394
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:37,413
The children.

395
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:40,149
You can be seen to love them, no?

396
00:28:40,183 --> 00:28:41,917
Of course!

397
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:51,093
I always knew
this day would come.

398
00:28:51,128 --> 00:28:53,596
As long as you are with me
in spirit...

399
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,666
- I always will be.
- And with no one else.

400
00:28:59,536 --> 00:29:03,205
That is equally impossible,
Vannozza.

401
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,344
So we take vows of chastity
along with your new status?

402
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:11,213
Must we take vows of poverty too?

You are still

You will only change your name

you will have every prince

But He must already be
pleased, Holy Father.

00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:08,564
Here we are.

484
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:13,569
You must help me, Cesare.

485
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:17,940
You must help me interpret...

486
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:20,442
...the great silence
of God.

487
00:36:22,412 --> 00:36:24,980
[Cesare]: Wait!
Let me!

488
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:32,588
- Come.
- Help me... do His will.

489
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:37,693
We have been entrusted...

490
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:41,029
...with the keys
to His kingdom.

491
00:36:41,064 --> 00:36:44,366
The King of France must be
aware, Ambassador,

492
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,704
that we have placed the papal
mitre in the hands of an ape.

493
00:36:48,738 --> 00:36:53,575
He has hopes, Cardinal, that the
office brings its own grace with it,

494
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,712
and that the grace of God can
transform the worst of men.

495
00:36:56,746 --> 00:36:58,380
And if it doesn't?

496
00:36:58,414 --> 00:37:02,618
We will observe with interest
what harm a mitred ape can do.

497
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:04,753
Hm.

498
00:37:04,787 --> 00:37:07,322
These offices we grant
in the full expectation

499
00:37:07,357 --> 00:37:10,159
they will be used wisely
for the restoration

500
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:12,995
of the honour
of our Holy Mother Church.

501
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:14,396
Dominus vobiscum.

502
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,900
- [All]: Dominus vobiscum.
- And, finally,

503
00:37:17,934 --> 00:37:24,106
the greatest office in our gift,
the post of Vice-Chancellor,

504
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:28,043
the office that stands
a reed's width

505
00:37:28,077 --> 00:37:30,445
from our papacy.

506
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,382
We grant...

507
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:36,485
...the most august,
the most valued colleague,

508
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:42,024
the brightest hope
for the future of the Church,

509
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:44,393
Cardinal...

510
00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:47,262
...Ascanio Sforza.

511
00:37:47,297 --> 00:37:49,631
[Cardinals murmuring]

512
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,870
Simony!

513
00:37:54,904 --> 00:37:57,239
I charge you now in public

514
00:37:57,273 --> 00:38:02,778
with trading sacred offices
like a market huckster!

515
00:38:02,812 --> 00:38:05,981
May I remind the cardinal
he is in consistry.

516
00:38:06,015 --> 00:38:08,183
Perhaps we misheard him.

517
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:11,353
That office was promised to me.

518
00:38:11,387 --> 00:38:14,523
Ah.
Did you pay for it?

519
00:38:14,557 --> 00:38:17,526
With my acceptance
of your foul election.

520
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,530
When the pope pledges
to banish all suspicion

521
00:38:21,564 --> 00:38:25,534
of simony from the cardinalate,
he keeps his word.

522
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:29,338
God has chosen us as a new broom

523
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:33,642
to sweep the Vatican clean
of corruption, which is

524
00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:37,479
precisely why we choose one
who has no expectation

525
00:38:37,513 --> 00:38:42,684
of advancement...
Cardinal Sforza.

526
00:38:50,026 --> 00:38:54,830
And I pray I may prove worthy
of the honour.

527
00:38:54,864 --> 00:38:58,800
And I pray so too.

528
00:38:58,835 --> 00:39:00,736
In fact,

529
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:05,474
I fully approve
of his new... broom.

530
00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:09,511
[Cardinals muttering]

531
00:39:11,514 --> 00:39:13,615
Kiss the ring, you fool.

532
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:19,288
As do I.

533
00:39:21,457 --> 00:39:27,829
And I deeply regret
my recent intemperance.

534
00:39:27,864 --> 00:39:35,003
In honour of his appointment,
I invite Cardinal Sforza,

535
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:37,839
and Your Holiness

536
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:40,342
and the College of Cardinals

537
00:39:40,376 --> 00:39:43,045
to a banquet at my palace

538
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:45,947
in two days' time.

539
00:39:45,982 --> 00:39:48,216
[Cardinals murmuring]

540
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:05,701
Are you going
to share it with me?

541
00:40:05,735 --> 00:40:09,071
Share what, Holy Father?

542
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:12,407
Why you bring a monkey
to a banquet?

543
00:40:12,442 --> 00:40:18,046
Oh, I fear the other cardinals might not
share your appetite for reformation.

544
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:19,881
And your monkey does?

545
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:24,252
Why, yes. He is an excellent
judge of appetite.

546
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:25,754
Huh!

547
00:40:25,788 --> 00:40:29,591
Reform to our Holy Mother Church
may happen slowly, but...

548
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:33,995
God has spoken to me as he spoke
to my predecessor, Pope Innocent.

549
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,098
Happen it must.

550
00:40:36,132 --> 00:40:41,002
Shall we dine on gruel
tonight, then, Your Holiness?

551
00:40:41,037 --> 00:40:46,675
- I could inform my cooks. - We are your guests
tonight, My Lord Cardinal. We will dine

552
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:48,343
according to your choosing.

553
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:51,513
Thank goodness.
I can have the wine poured?

554
00:40:51,547 --> 00:40:53,148
Let me taste that.

555
00:40:53,182 --> 00:40:57,018
It is of an excellent vintage,
My Lord.

556
00:40:57,053 --> 00:41:00,288
I have no doubt.

557
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:04,860
Oh!
[Laughing]

558
00:41:04,894 --> 00:41:07,129
And how is his palate?

559
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:14,469
Well, it's superb.

560
00:41:14,504 --> 00:41:17,506
- He salutes your good taste.
- Thank you.

561
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,308
A great wine,
like the papacy itself...

562
00:41:20,343 --> 00:41:22,677
mature, rounded,

563
00:41:22,712 --> 00:41:25,814
its roots in the soil,
its bouquet in the heavens,

564
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:28,016
consumed by a monkey.

565
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:32,954
I suspect a metaphor is
lurking there, My Lord Cardinal?

566
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:36,458
We are but animals
blessed with an eternal soul.

567
00:41:36,492 --> 00:41:39,694
There go we,
but for the grace of God.

568
00:41:39,729 --> 00:41:42,831
[Cesare]: It seems nature,
not metaphor, calls.

569
00:41:42,865 --> 00:41:46,835
[Laughing]
He begs Your Lordship's pardon.

570
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:49,671
[Laughing]
Excuse me.

571
00:41:49,705 --> 00:41:51,940
Excuse my monkey.

572
00:41:57,213 --> 00:41:59,214
Why such a hurry?

573
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:31,112
- My God, you're fast.
- For a cook.

574
00:42:31,147 --> 00:42:33,148
And you for a cleric.

575
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:38,386
On kitchen duty?

576
00:42:38,421 --> 00:42:41,590
For tonight.

577
00:42:41,624 --> 00:42:45,794
- Who pays you?
- Cardinal Orsini.

578
00:42:45,828 --> 00:42:49,130
Whatever you're being paid,
I'll double it.

579
00:42:49,165 --> 00:42:51,933
- I could use someone that fast.
- You could?

580
00:42:51,968 --> 00:42:53,969
Oh, yeah.

581
00:43:00,076 --> 00:43:02,944
But not that stupid!

582
00:43:05,281 --> 00:43:09,351
Far from stupidity, sire.

583
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:14,189
I imagine from your offer
that you have need of me, yes?

584
00:43:14,223 --> 00:43:19,628
So to kill the servant you have
need of would indeed be stupid.

585
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:25,400
Call me stupid, then.
Tell me, tell me why I shouldn't. Hmm?

586
00:43:25,434 --> 00:43:28,937
Because of the sixth commandment,
thou shalt not kill.

587
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:32,073
I'll be forgiven.
The pope is my confessor.

588
00:43:34,076 --> 00:43:38,880
Because you'll never meet
another assassin like me.

589
00:43:40,883 --> 00:43:45,186
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

590
00:43:48,257 --> 00:43:50,258
[Grunting furiously]

591
00:44:09,612 --> 00:44:14,182
- But we were talking terms, yes?
- We were.

592
00:44:16,185 --> 00:44:19,654
I would gladly work
for the pope or the pope's son,

593
00:44:19,689 --> 00:44:24,225
for these cardinals can,
as you know, prove fickle,

594
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,361
and it seems
someone as pitiless as you...

595
00:44:26,395 --> 00:44:31,700
- Yes?
- Needs someone as pitiless as me.

596
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:33,368
Elaborate.

597
00:44:33,402 --> 00:44:39,474
I have smothered infants
in their beds.

598
00:44:39,508 --> 00:44:43,044
But only
when their parents paid me.

599
00:44:46,682 --> 00:44:48,650
And in the powder?

600
00:44:48,684 --> 00:44:51,252
Eternal life.

601
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:57,025
- For whom?
- You. Your father.

602
00:44:59,528 --> 00:45:00,996
It's not very subtle.

603
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:04,099
No subtlety needed tonight.

604
00:45:04,133 --> 00:45:06,267
They all want you dead.

605
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:25,520
Serve this...

606
00:45:25,554 --> 00:45:27,555
...to Orsini.

607
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:40,835
[Quiet murmuring]

608
00:46:08,197 --> 00:46:10,732
Your Grace.

609
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:13,001
You are bleeding.

610
00:46:15,004 --> 00:46:17,305
Damned monkey bit me.

611
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:21,810
Animals will do that.
They lack soul.

612
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:25,213
I propose a toast.

613
00:46:25,247 --> 00:46:26,815
To harmony,

614
00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:28,950
amongst us,

615
00:46:28,984 --> 00:46:31,419
servants of God.

616
00:46:31,454 --> 00:46:37,325
- Harmony. - To the communion of saints
and the forgiveness of sins.

617
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,827
Amen.

618
00:46:38,861 --> 00:46:40,061
Amen.

619
00:46:48,404 --> 00:46:52,607
I'd like to propose
a second toast. To metaphor.

620
00:46:52,641 --> 00:46:55,844
- [Cesare]: Why metaphor?
- Because she's so

621
00:46:55,878 --> 00:47:00,715
infinitely pliable. A prince
one minute, a monkey the next.

622
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:06,921
And what her hidden meaning is only
God in His infinite wisdom knows.

623
00:47:11,193 --> 00:47:14,362
I propose another toast.

624
00:47:14,396 --> 00:47:17,799
- To monkeys.
- Monkeys?

625
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:20,368
They lick your hand one minute,

626
00:47:20,402 --> 00:47:26,708
bite your neck the next. And everyone knows
what you do with the monkey that bites you.

627
00:47:26,742 --> 00:47:29,544
And what do you do
with the monkey that bites you?

628
00:47:29,578 --> 00:47:31,813
[Choking]
Your Eminence, you're ill.

629
00:47:31,847 --> 00:47:33,448
You wring its neck.

630
00:47:38,053 --> 00:47:42,056
- [Orsini]: Poison.
- Poison!

631
00:47:42,091 --> 00:47:44,092
I accuse!

632
00:47:44,126 --> 00:47:46,628
The cooks?
Come, Father.

633
00:47:46,662 --> 00:47:49,063
[Choking]

634
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,868
[Man]: Send for help!

635
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:01,676
- The poison was meant for us.
- That's not possible.

636
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,611
We were saved by a monkey,
Father.

637
00:48:03,646 --> 00:48:05,113
You don't poison the pope!

638
00:48:05,147 --> 00:48:07,115
Are you aware
what the gossips call you?

639
00:48:07,149 --> 00:48:10,185
The mitred ape. Half of Rome was
waiting to celebrate this outcome...

640
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:12,987
You poison a rat,
you poison a rabid dog!

641
00:48:13,022 --> 00:48:16,090
Not the Vicar of Rome,
not the heir to St. Peter!

642
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:18,226
- [Man]: Bring my carriage!
- The idea offends you?

00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:21,129
It offends me, it offends
nature, it offends God Himself!

- So, God will take His revenge, then.
- Yes, He will. With our help.

- Go!
- [Man]: Yah!

646
00:48:36,846 --> 00:48:38,313
Excellent service.

647
00:48:38,347 --> 00:48:41,816
- I fear it is not over yet.
- What do you mean?

648
00:48:41,851 --> 00:48:45,286
Well, there's more to your Borgia
family than father and son.

649
00:48:45,321 --> 00:48:49,457
- What do you mean?
- I mean we must hurry, My Lord.

650
00:48:49,491 --> 00:48:51,860
Your whole family's in danger.

651
00:49:04,273 --> 00:49:06,241
- Micheletto!
- Am I too late?

652
00:49:06,275 --> 00:49:08,877
- We were waiting for you.
- Then you're too late!

[Groaning in pain]
What are you doing?!

654
00:49:12,248 --> 00:49:13,882

Arrest this household.

664

You planned this massacre
thoroughly.

If I had planned it, My Lord,

having this conversation.

And o planned it?

Cardinal Orsini.

And Della Rovere?

672
00:50:26,221 --> 00:50:29,557
I know nothing of him.

00:50:29,591 --> 00:50:31,059

[Panting]

675
00:50:33,662 --> 00:50:36,464
I had but one master.

676
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:39,600
And now?

677
00:50:39,635 --> 00:50:44,639
And now I am like a stray dog,

678
00:50:44,673 --> 00:50:46,507
masterless.

679
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:52,313
Unless your kind offer
still stands.

680
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:56,351
You could have...
let things take their course...

681
00:50:56,385 --> 00:50:58,653
Betrayed me.

682
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:02,323
- Most of your kind do.
- My kind?

683
00:51:02,358 --> 00:51:06,260
I do not have a kind.

684
00:51:09,965 --> 00:51:12,934
And I suspect neither do you.

685

Your name, sweet assassin.

You must prove yourself
worthy of my trust, th.

689
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:37,225
- This is not proof enough?
- Perhaps. Perhaps not.

690
00:51:37,259 --> 00:51:41,596
- Can you dispose of these corpses?
- You would keep them secret?

691
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,865
More than that.
I would keep you secret.

692
00:51:46,702 --> 00:51:50,838
Dump them in the Tiber.
Meet me by the Vatican gates

693
00:51:50,873 --> 00:51:54,742
in two hours' time. We shall
discuss your future service.

694
00:52:01,283 --> 00:52:04,185
[Whispering]: Mother.

695
00:52:04,219 --> 00:52:08,156
Are you trying to frighten me?

696
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:10,191
I'm sorry, Mother.

697
00:52:12,361 --> 00:52:15,630
Why are you here, Cesare?

698
00:52:15,664 --> 00:52:18,099
I imagine things...

699
00:52:18,133 --> 00:52:20,168
murders,

700
00:52:20,202 --> 00:52:22,770
blood-spattered throats,

701
00:52:22,805 --> 00:52:25,506
poisoned chalices.

702
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:29,544
Perhaps you're not wrong.
We have many enemies now.

703
00:52:32,214 --> 00:52:33,681
And Lucrezia?

704
00:52:33,715 --> 00:52:38,186
She's sleeping.
You miss her that much?

705
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,354
Always.

706
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:43,858
If anything happened
to her, I'd...

707
00:52:43,892 --> 00:52:45,927
...I'd die.

708
00:52:45,961 --> 00:52:49,030
What could possibly happen?

709
00:52:49,064 --> 00:52:52,033
I'm putting a guard on the house.

710
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:54,535
Is it so dangerous outside?

711
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,537
We are in a different city now.

712
00:52:56,572 --> 00:52:59,307
Is it still called Rome?

713
00:52:59,341 --> 00:53:01,843
I'm not sure it has a name.

714
00:53:04,012 --> 00:53:06,981
Father.

715
00:53:07,015 --> 00:53:09,650
Father!

716
00:53:09,685 --> 00:53:11,652
Father, I've had to place
a guard on the...

717
00:53:11,687 --> 00:53:16,124
The good cardinal, my son,
has been expressing his shock

718
00:53:16,158 --> 00:53:19,494
and dismay
at this evening's outcome.

719
00:53:19,528 --> 00:53:21,662
Poison, it seems, was the cause

720
00:53:21,697 --> 00:53:24,132
of Cardinal Orsini's demise.

721
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:26,167
One shudders at the thought.

722
00:53:26,201 --> 00:53:27,735
As to who poisoned him,

723
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:30,838
I have no idea.
Perhaps we should

724
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:34,308
ask ourselves, who benefits most
from his death?

725
00:53:34,343 --> 00:53:36,377
And what are you implying,
Your Eminence?

726
00:53:36,411 --> 00:53:39,046
I am implying nothing.

727
00:53:39,081 --> 00:53:41,916
I am merely offering
His Holiness any help I can

728
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:44,352
in unmasking the culprit.

729
00:53:44,386 --> 00:53:48,623
Our Holy Mother Church can
afford no such scandals.

730
00:53:53,228 --> 00:53:57,865
We have Orsini's household
staff in irons, Your Holiness.

731
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,369
- Cardinal.
- The good cardinal, my brother,

732
00:54:01,403 --> 00:54:05,940
has offered to help us unmask
the culprit behind this plot.

733
00:54:05,974 --> 00:54:09,410
We apprehended this wretch
skulking outside by the gate.

734
00:54:09,444 --> 00:54:12,213
A plot, by definition,
needs more than one participant,

735
00:54:12,247 --> 00:54:15,750
- does it not?
- Do you recognize him?

736
00:54:23,091 --> 00:54:26,093
Didn't he pour the wine?

737
00:54:26,128 --> 00:54:29,230
[Cesare]: Do you know
this man, Cardinal Della Rovere?

738
00:54:29,264 --> 00:54:31,499
I know he attended
at the cardinal's table,

739
00:54:31,533 --> 00:54:32,967
but there were many of those.

740
00:54:33,001 --> 00:54:38,139
Beyond that, nothing.

741
00:54:38,173 --> 00:54:41,175
If this creature is
indeed the poisoner,

742
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:45,379
some hours on the strappado
should loosen his tongue.

743
00:54:45,414 --> 00:54:46,914
See if he talks.

already exhausted yourself

in our father's defence.

00:55:17,479 --> 00:55:19,981
Now I could spend a good hour
questioning this man.

756
00:55:20,015 --> 00:55:22,016
Is that really a task
for a cleric?

Would you have talked?

Only to sing your praises,
My Lord.

763

I can have word sent out
that you couldn't be broken.

And then?

768
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:13,634
Then...

769
00:56:13,669 --> 00:56:17,905
...get close to Cardinal
Della Rovere.

What he plans.

Haven't I hurt you
enough already?

my back must tell its own story.

that he has an interest

in the male torso.

And even I cannot
convincingly whip myself.

Well, all of the others bought

We merely proved ourselves
better at the game.

we are one less cardinal
this morning.

809
00:59:12,848 --> 00:59:16,317
I was your age
when I became a cardinal.

810
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,185
Seems like yesterday.

811
00:59:20,188 --> 00:59:21,722
This red...

812
00:59:21,756 --> 00:59:25,926
...signifies that you are ready
to spill your blood in defence

813
00:59:25,961 --> 00:59:29,163
of the Christian faith.

814
00:59:29,197 --> 00:59:32,700
- No, Father.
- Are you, my son, ready

815
00:59:32,734 --> 00:59:36,003
to spill your blood in defence
of the Christian faith?

816
00:59:36,037 --> 00:59:37,705
I think you are!

817
00:59:37,739 --> 00:59:39,707
For the defence
of my family, perhaps.

818
00:59:39,741 --> 00:59:41,942
- That too.
- Give me control

819
00:59:41,977 --> 00:59:45,212
- of the papal armies and I will protect
us all. - We will have one son

820
00:59:45,247 --> 00:59:47,948
in the cloth and one in armour.

821
00:59:47,983 --> 00:59:50,918
- You know our wishes.
- But a cardinal's red?

822
00:59:50,952 --> 00:59:53,087
And Lucrezia must marry.

823
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:54,855
So soon?

824
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:58,259
- She is 14 years old.
- She is just a child.

825
00:59:58,293 --> 01:00:01,862
We must bind our enemies
to us. Make friends of them.

826
01:00:01,897 --> 01:00:04,498
And what better way is there
than marriage?

827
01:00:04,533 --> 01:00:08,936
You can perform the rite...
as cardinal.

828
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:12,873
Am I a cardinal already?

829
01:00:21,883 --> 01:00:24,051
And they tortured you for...

830
01:00:24,085 --> 01:00:27,021
...how long?

831
01:00:27,055 --> 01:00:30,591
A day and a night, Your Eminence.

832
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:36,530
And you revealed?

833
01:00:38,533 --> 01:00:41,535
There was nothing to reveal,
Your Eminence.

834
01:00:49,744 --> 01:00:51,745
Ecce homo.

835
01:00:54,249 --> 01:00:57,484
"Behold the man."

836
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:00,054
They scourged our saviour thus.

837
01:01:03,858 --> 01:01:07,962
Is it true,
what's being rumoured?

838
01:01:07,996 --> 01:01:12,333
That the good cardinal
inadvertently poisoned himself?

839
01:01:12,367 --> 01:01:15,002
Who would have profited
from his death?

840
01:01:15,036 --> 01:01:17,504
Certainly not Cardinal Orsini.

841
01:01:17,539 --> 01:01:21,442
- Who takes possession of his properties?
- Borgia.

842
01:01:21,476 --> 01:01:22,977
Well, then.

843
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,848
These methods are not mine.

844
01:01:27,882 --> 01:01:31,352
You think they are mine,
Your Eminence?

845
01:01:31,386 --> 01:01:34,021
What are your methods?

846
01:01:34,055 --> 01:01:36,190
Discretion.

847
01:01:36,224 --> 01:01:37,625
Silence.

848
01:01:37,659 --> 01:01:39,660
And you have suffered
for your silence.

849
01:01:41,663 --> 01:01:45,199
Why?

850
01:01:45,233 --> 01:01:47,468
Like you,

851
01:01:47,502 --> 01:01:50,371
I hate this Borgia.

852
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:55,209
And if I can be of any use...

853
01:01:55,243 --> 01:01:59,546
I need someone I can trust.

854
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:02,683
You can trust my hatred
of this Borgia pope.

855
01:02:07,922 --> 01:02:10,691
[Gasping in pain]

856
01:02:10,725 --> 01:02:14,862
I can trust these wounds
of yours.

857
01:02:19,701 --> 01:02:23,837
They will last for a lifetime,

858
01:02:23,872 --> 01:02:26,940
- Your Eminence.
- Indeed.

859
01:02:28,943 --> 01:02:31,912
I need to assemble a gathering
of every cardinal

860
01:02:31,946 --> 01:02:35,349
who shares your feelings.

861
01:02:35,383 --> 01:02:38,752
In absolute secrecy.

862
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:10,851
May I thank you, Holy Father,
for bequeathing to me your precious time.

863
01:03:12,854 --> 01:03:16,156
Go on, my child.

864
01:03:16,191 --> 01:03:17,891
I have sinned mightily,

865
01:03:17,926 --> 01:03:20,227
Your Holiness,

866
01:03:20,261 --> 01:03:24,264
and know there are some sins
that only the pope can forgive.

867
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:26,100
They are few,

868
01:03:26,134 --> 01:03:29,169
but the most grave.

869
01:03:31,172 --> 01:03:32,706
Tell me.

870
01:03:34,709 --> 01:03:38,011
My husband, Your Holiness,

871
01:03:38,046 --> 01:03:40,514
has long been...

872
01:03:40,548 --> 01:03:43,050
...distasteful to me.

873
01:03:43,084 --> 01:03:45,252
I fear...

874
01:03:45,286 --> 01:03:48,655
...you are not the first woman
to share that fate.

875
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:52,760
His person I find repellent.

876
01:03:52,794 --> 01:03:55,596
His advances sicken me.

877
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:59,633
His hand upon my body makes me
retch with disgust.

878
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:04,605
Have you denied him...

879
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:07,007
...your duties as a wife?

880
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:11,779
No, Your Holiness.

881
01:04:11,813 --> 01:04:15,883
I performed them
as the Church says I must.

882
01:04:15,917 --> 01:04:17,384
So I...

883
01:04:17,418 --> 01:04:20,120
...fail
to discern the sin.

884
01:04:24,626 --> 01:04:28,095
I found myself with child.

885
01:04:28,129 --> 01:04:30,430
The thought of this body of mine,

886
01:04:30,465 --> 01:04:33,300
marred by the presence
of his offspring...

887
01:04:35,303 --> 01:04:37,604
inside...

888
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:40,641
drove me to an act
of transgression that...

889
01:04:44,646 --> 01:04:46,980
Go on, my daughter.

890
01:04:49,484 --> 01:04:53,153
I put an end to my pregnancy.

891
01:04:55,323 --> 01:04:58,158
That is indeed most grave.

892
01:05:00,161 --> 01:05:02,129
A sin...

893
01:05:02,163 --> 01:05:04,565
...that only
the pope...

894
01:05:04,599 --> 01:05:07,935
...can forgive.
Only God may forgive.

895
01:05:09,938 --> 01:05:13,073
But we may intercede...

896
01:05:13,107 --> 01:05:16,310
...on your behalf.

897
01:05:20,215 --> 01:05:23,283
Then, please, Your Holiness,

898
01:05:23,318 --> 01:05:27,421
...beg for me His mercy.

899
01:05:27,455 --> 01:05:29,756
And...

900
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:33,760
...your husband?
He knows of this?

901
01:05:33,795 --> 01:05:35,762
He knows nothing.

902
01:05:35,797 --> 01:05:40,000
He has retired to his castle
in Bassano.

903
01:05:40,034 --> 01:05:43,270
He satisfies his lust on me
no longer.

904
01:05:43,304 --> 01:05:45,205
And you are...

905
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:49,509
now... chaste?

906
01:05:52,947 --> 01:05:55,415
I have no one, Your Holiness.

907
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:58,919
Then perhaps
that is to be your penitence...

908
01:05:58,953 --> 01:06:04,091
to follow your husband
to Bassano, as is your duty.

909
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:07,094
I would prefer a life
of destitution, Your Holiness.

910
01:06:07,128 --> 01:06:09,096
Then love God.

911
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:12,900
And find peace
within the walls of a nunnery.

912
01:06:12,934 --> 01:06:16,003
Can one find peace
in such a love, Your Holiness?

913
01:06:16,037 --> 01:06:19,539
It is what we must do,

914
01:06:19,574 --> 01:06:22,809
Giulia Farnese.

915
01:06:28,049 --> 01:06:31,018
I fear
I may lack Your Holiness's will.

916
01:06:31,052 --> 01:06:35,622
I am still young, Your Holiness,

917
01:06:35,657 --> 01:06:38,125
and my body, I am sure,

918
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:40,794
could find, and give,
much happiness

919
01:06:40,828 --> 01:06:43,430
if my soul could find peace.

920
01:06:47,835 --> 01:06:49,937
Do you beg forgiveness from God

921
01:06:49,971 --> 01:06:51,939
for the enormity of your crime?

922
01:06:51,973 --> 01:06:54,308
I do so daily.

923
01:06:54,342 --> 01:06:57,144
Your Holiness, my soul yearns
for its punishment.

924
01:06:57,178 --> 01:07:00,113
Then you must fast.

925
01:07:00,148 --> 01:07:04,217
From matins till evensong.

926
01:07:04,252 --> 01:07:07,554
And flagellate your naked body
twice nightly.

927
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:09,356
With knotted cord,

928
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:13,427
- Your Holiness?
- Cord of silk will suffice.

929
01:07:13,461 --> 01:07:17,097
To destroy the beauty
the Lord has granted you

930
01:07:17,131 --> 01:07:21,101
would be to compound your sin.

931
01:07:21,135 --> 01:07:23,303
E go te absolve...

932
01:07:23,338 --> 01:07:26,239
...ab omnibus censuris,
et peccatis,

933
01:07:26,274 --> 01:07:28,408
in nomine Patris,

934
01:07:28,443 --> 01:07:30,644
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

935
01:07:30,678 --> 01:07:33,180
- Amen.
- Amen.

936
01:07:41,022 --> 01:07:42,990
[Sighing]

937
01:07:43,024 --> 01:07:45,025
Giulia Farnese.

938
01:07:47,261 --> 01:07:48,829
Your Holiness?

939
01:07:50,832 --> 01:07:53,300
One of your lineage...

940
01:07:53,334 --> 01:07:56,770
...to be destitute...
we cannot allow it.

941
01:07:56,804 --> 01:08:01,475
We must find you...
some...

942
01:08:01,509 --> 01:08:04,444
...temporary and...

943
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:06,480
...temporal refuge.

944
01:08:14,956 --> 01:08:18,325
[Man]: Keep the fire
away from the straw!

945
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:20,527
- [Man]: It is!
- [Man]: Good!

946
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,936
- [Man]: Boy, keep the banners and colours
all together. - [Man]: Right, sir!

947
01:08:29,971 --> 01:08:34,674
Some of you voted for him,

948
01:08:34,709 --> 01:08:40,514
for which unfortunate choice
you are now forgiven. [Quiet chuckling]

949
01:08:40,548 --> 01:08:43,183
But most of you voted against.

950
01:08:43,217 --> 01:08:45,519
We have assembled the barest
of majorities.

951
01:08:45,553 --> 01:08:48,021
But then,
this Borgia pope was elected

952
01:08:48,056 --> 01:08:50,690
with just such a majority.

953
01:08:54,062 --> 01:08:58,198
The cardinal's demise was...
sudden.

954
01:08:58,232 --> 01:09:00,667
So it seems.

955
01:09:02,837 --> 01:09:07,107
But his palace is ideal as a...

956
01:09:07,141 --> 01:09:11,111
...place
of penitence...

957
01:09:11,145 --> 01:09:13,146
...and...

958
01:09:13,181 --> 01:09:15,182
...self-reflection.

959
01:09:28,529 --> 01:09:32,599
[Rovere]: If it can be proven,
what many of us suspect...

960
01:09:32,633 --> 01:09:35,535
corruption, simony,

961
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:39,106
the blatant sale
of the sacred offices,

962
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:43,643
and worse, the utter degradation
of the office of the papacy

963
01:09:43,678 --> 01:09:45,679
in the eyes
of the Christian world...

964
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:53,854
[Borgia]: You must think
of your sojourn here

965
01:09:53,888 --> 01:09:57,023
as a retreat.

966
01:09:57,058 --> 01:09:58,558
A retreat?

967
01:10:02,063 --> 01:10:05,232
The cardinal had this tunnel
built.

968
01:10:05,266 --> 01:10:09,236
It leads
inside the Vatican walls.

969
01:10:13,908 --> 01:10:17,844
If you ever find yourself
in need of...

970
01:10:17,879 --> 01:10:21,348
...spiritual comfort..

971
01:10:21,382 --> 01:10:24,885
...in your loneliness...
Your Holiness.

972
01:10:24,919 --> 01:10:29,322
You must not be afraid
to avail of it.

973
01:10:29,357 --> 01:10:31,558
Day or night.

974
01:10:36,697 --> 01:10:38,698
We shall leave you now.

975
01:10:41,035 --> 01:10:44,437
This passage goes both ways.

976
01:10:44,472 --> 01:10:48,175
Your Holiness must feel
free to visit...

977
01:10:48,209 --> 01:10:53,180
...if God's love were ever
to leave him wanting.

978
01:10:57,251 --> 01:11:02,355
The cardinal summons me in the dead
of night. Is there a reason?

979
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:05,859
These are turbulent times,
Father.

980
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:14,868
Dottore...

981
01:11:18,105 --> 01:11:20,440
You can leave us now.

982
01:11:23,911 --> 01:11:28,915
I need advice, dottore,
on a delicate matter.

983
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:31,718
The deposition of a pope.

984
01:11:33,721 --> 01:11:36,356
Delicate indeed.

985
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:39,793
And, if I may say so, dangerous.

986
01:13:21,529 --> 01:13:24,064
Stop that.

987
01:13:26,067 --> 01:13:28,568
You have done penance enough.

988
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:37,344
Who then will forgive us,
Your Holiness?

989
01:13:37,378 --> 01:13:39,379
God will.

990
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:24,758
[Muttering]

991
01:14:24,792 --> 01:14:27,927
Huggucio of Pisa states:

992
01:14:27,962 --> 01:14:32,866
"Ecce publico fornicator,
publico habet concubinem..."

993
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:36,436
The pope who publicly fornicates,
publicly keeps a concubine...

994
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:39,472
Can indeed be deposed,

995
01:14:39,507 --> 01:14:45,545
because to scandalize the Church
is in itself heresy.

996
01:14:45,579 --> 01:14:49,983
But one would need firm evidence

997
01:14:50,017 --> 01:14:53,019
of notorious and public lechery.

998
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:59,359
Whose bed is this?

999
01:14:59,393 --> 01:15:01,728
Yours, of course.

1000
01:15:04,165 --> 01:15:06,166
Whose bed was this?

1001
01:15:09,904 --> 01:15:13,006
It belonged to a cardinal
and a fool.

1002
01:15:15,009 --> 01:15:17,177
What kind of fool?

1003
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:22,248
The kind of fool
who doesn't understand that

1004
01:15:22,283 --> 01:15:25,084
God's work can be done

1005
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:27,487
even by the most unlikely
of his servants.

1006
01:15:27,521 --> 01:15:31,024
- And that Rome needs now is...
- You.

1007
01:15:33,527 --> 01:15:35,028
Power.

1008
01:15:40,468 --> 01:15:44,704
You're so beautiful,
Giulia Farnese.

1009
01:15:46,707 --> 01:15:49,709
I would have you painted.

1010
01:16:18,572 --> 01:16:21,841
- She is beautiful.
- She is.

1011
01:16:23,844 --> 01:16:26,112
More beautiful
than your painting.

1012
01:16:26,146 --> 01:16:31,050
- I've just begun.
- You must do better, then.

1013
01:16:31,085 --> 01:16:34,153
Her hair curls, here.

1014
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,458
Who is she?

1015
01:16:38,492 --> 01:16:41,361
Giulia Farnese.

1016
01:16:41,395 --> 01:16:43,763
At your service.

1017
01:16:43,797 --> 01:16:46,799
Why is he painting you,

1018
01:16:46,834 --> 01:16:48,801
Giulia Farnese?

1019
01:16:48,836 --> 01:16:52,138
Your father, the pope,
commissioned him.

1020
01:16:52,172 --> 01:16:53,940
Will he paint one of me?

1021
01:16:53,974 --> 01:16:56,075
I will commission him, now.

1022
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:59,045
[Goat bleating]

1023
01:16:59,079 --> 01:17:01,047
Why are you holding a baby goat?

1024
01:17:01,081 --> 01:17:04,317
It will become a unicorn.

1025
01:17:04,351 --> 01:17:06,352
Then I want a unicorn.

1026
01:17:10,124 --> 01:17:13,660
Or even better, a sea horse.

1027
01:17:18,766 --> 01:17:22,702
I want to lie on a bed of seashells
and have a sea horse in my lap.

1028
01:17:22,736 --> 01:17:24,604
[Giulia]: Like this one?

1029
01:17:29,109 --> 01:17:32,011
Yes.

1030
01:17:32,046 --> 01:17:34,447
Just like this one.

1031
01:17:34,481 --> 01:17:36,349
You must have it, then.

1032
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:38,618
I can?

1033
01:17:42,456 --> 01:17:45,091
It's a gift.

1034
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:49,028
From Giulia to Lucrezia.

1035
01:17:49,063 --> 01:17:53,232
- Can I kiss you, then?
- Only if we are to be friends.

1036
01:17:53,267 --> 01:17:56,269
We are friends already.

1037
01:18:00,975 --> 01:18:03,543
I am to have
my portrait painted, Mama.

1038
01:18:03,577 --> 01:18:06,879
- You are?
- But I don't want a goat,

1039
01:18:06,914 --> 01:18:12,051
or a unicorn. I told Giulia I
want a sea horse like this one.

1040
01:18:12,086 --> 01:18:15,088
- You told who?
- Giulia Farnese.

1041
01:18:17,091 --> 01:18:19,726
Giulia Farnese is having
her portrait painted?

1042
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,594
By Pinturicchio.

1043
01:18:21,629 --> 01:18:24,030
Papa commissioned him.

1044
01:18:27,935 --> 01:18:29,569
Ah.

1045
01:18:29,603 --> 01:18:33,439
She gave me this pendant.

1046
01:18:33,474 --> 01:18:37,410
I think a sea horse is better
than a unicorn, don't you Mama?

1047
01:18:37,444 --> 01:18:41,547
I've heard she is beautiful,
this Giulia Farnese.

1048
01:18:44,718 --> 01:18:48,388
- Papa thinks so.
- I am sure he does.

1049
01:18:52,493 --> 01:18:55,628
A different type of beauty
to yours, Mama.

1050
01:18:55,663 --> 01:19:00,233
Not Spanish.
Italian.

1051
01:19:00,267 --> 01:19:03,469
Her hair is light,
and full of curls.

1052
01:19:09,576 --> 01:19:12,245
And where did you meet her,
Lucrezia?

1053
01:19:14,248 --> 01:19:16,215
In Papa's rooms.

1054
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:18,251
In the Vatican.

1055
01:19:26,026 --> 01:19:29,729
- [Man]: Please, My Lady!
- [Man]: Your Holiness!

1056
01:19:29,763 --> 01:19:31,230
My dear.

1057
01:19:31,265 --> 01:19:34,400
You told me
that the pope can love God,

1058
01:19:34,435 --> 01:19:36,469
but to be seen
to love anyone else

1059
01:19:36,503 --> 01:19:38,371
- would be impossible.
- Your Holiness...

1060
01:19:38,405 --> 01:19:40,406
- Now, now...
- Shall we remove ourselves?

1061
01:19:40,441 --> 01:19:42,408
That the pope must be chaste,

1062
01:19:42,443 --> 01:19:45,411
and he must be seen to be chaste.

1063
01:19:45,446 --> 01:19:48,081
Don't you want them to hear?
That you have a new whore?!

1064
01:19:48,115 --> 01:19:50,349
- Mother!
- Farnese!

1065
01:19:50,384 --> 01:19:52,218
- Get out!
- That you've installed her

1066
01:19:52,252 --> 01:19:54,153
- in the Orsini Palace?
- What?

1067
01:19:54,188 --> 01:19:56,155
- We were...
- Be gone!

1068
01:19:56,190 --> 01:19:58,758
I banished my husband
for your sake!

1069
01:19:58,792 --> 01:20:02,261
You are the mother of my children! You will
always have a special place in my life.

1070
01:20:02,296 --> 01:20:05,264
- What about your promise?!
- There is no one...

1071
01:20:05,299 --> 01:20:07,600
...no one,
closer to me than you.

1072
01:20:07,634 --> 01:20:09,168
Why her?!

1073
01:20:09,203 --> 01:20:11,904
She was in need!
I had to help her.

1074
01:20:11,939 --> 01:20:14,874
You were destitute once!

1075
01:20:14,908 --> 01:20:17,276
[Cesare]: Be gone!
Out!

1076
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:19,245
[Man]: We were
in consultation...

1077
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:21,781
[Man]: Your Grace,
are leaving.

1078
01:20:31,391 --> 01:20:33,392
Don't lie to me.

1079
01:20:33,427 --> 01:20:34,894
To me, you cannot lie.

1080
01:20:34,928 --> 01:20:36,562
Then don't challenge me.

1081
01:20:36,597 --> 01:20:39,098
And never, ever
within these sacred walls.

1082
01:20:41,101 --> 01:20:45,104
I've dreamed about this room
and what it might do to you.

1083
01:20:47,274 --> 01:20:49,776
We need
a new understanding, then.

1084
01:20:51,779 --> 01:20:54,413
Perhaps.

1085
01:20:54,448 --> 01:20:56,916
I'll keep my peace.

1086
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:59,285
But I won't be humiliated.

1087
01:21:02,122 --> 01:21:03,723
I would have peace.

1088
01:21:03,757 --> 01:21:07,193
You commissioned a portrait
of her.

1089
01:21:07,227 --> 01:21:09,662
I shall have a portrait too

1090
01:21:09,696 --> 01:21:11,531
by the same new genius you found.

1091
01:21:11,565 --> 01:21:14,667
Pinturicchio.

1092
01:21:14,701 --> 01:21:18,004
He is good, but he's...

1093
01:21:18,038 --> 01:21:20,506
...expensive.

1094
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:24,177
All of Rome is yours
for the taking.

1095
01:21:24,211 --> 01:21:27,013
Make sure he does me justice.

1096
01:21:27,047 --> 01:21:30,049
I was beautiful once, no?

1097
01:21:32,052 --> 01:21:34,320
You still are.

1098
01:21:34,354 --> 01:21:37,723
We agreed, did we not,
that you would not lie?

1099
01:21:40,594 --> 01:21:45,031
He has placed his new whore
in Orsini's palace, no?

1100
01:21:45,065 --> 01:21:47,200
I believe so, Your Eminence.

1101
01:21:47,234 --> 01:21:50,336
Question the staff, then,
in secret,

1102
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:54,373
and in any way you see fit.

1103
01:21:54,408 --> 01:21:56,909
We need evidence of lechery,

1104
01:21:56,944 --> 01:21:59,946
fornication...

1105
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:04,483
publico habet concubinem.

1106
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:08,988
- Get these to the Deacon-
Cardinal for signatures.

1107
01:22:09,022 --> 01:22:10,523
Yes, Your Eminence.

1108
01:22:19,867 --> 01:22:22,335
He has met in secret
with those cardinals

1109
01:22:22,369 --> 01:22:25,171
that hate your father.

1110
01:22:25,205 --> 01:22:27,006
With Johannes Burchard,

1111
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,442
he is making a case
for your father's deposition.

1112
01:22:29,476 --> 01:22:31,110
On what grounds?

1113
01:22:33,513 --> 01:22:36,649
Notorious and public lechery...

1114
01:22:36,683 --> 01:22:39,719
Lechery?
My father?

1115
01:22:39,753 --> 01:22:41,888
God forbid.

1116
01:22:41,922 --> 01:22:43,422
Has he evidence?

1117
01:22:43,457 --> 01:22:46,792
He means to find it.

1118
01:22:50,063 --> 01:22:53,366
Then perhaps
we should find it first,

1119
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,835
and silence it before it speaks.

1120
01:22:58,171 --> 01:23:00,706
Your mother was somewhat
troubled yesterday.

1121
01:23:00,741 --> 01:23:05,511
She finds the change
in our life difficult.

1122
01:23:05,545 --> 01:23:07,513
So I noticed.

1123
01:23:07,547 --> 01:23:09,849
Do what you can
to keep her out of here.

1124
01:23:11,852 --> 01:23:14,320
It would help, maybe,
if you were more discreet

1125
01:23:14,354 --> 01:23:16,822
- in your affections.
- But I...

1126
01:23:16,857 --> 01:23:19,492
You are aware, Holy Father,
of the plots against you?

1127
01:23:19,526 --> 01:23:22,862
Oh, what would Rome be
without a good plot?

1128
01:23:24,865 --> 01:23:27,333
The College of Cardinals is
split down the middle.

1129
01:23:27,367 --> 01:23:31,704
What? Well, perhaps
we need some more cardinals.

1130
01:23:33,707 --> 01:23:36,175
Johannes Burchard has been
asked for an opinion...

1131
01:23:36,209 --> 01:23:38,544
[Chuckling]
Dear old Johannes.

1132
01:23:38,578 --> 01:23:42,214
- He does give excellent opinion.
- On your deposition, Father.

1133
01:23:44,217 --> 01:23:45,718
Indeed.

1134
01:23:45,752 --> 01:23:49,055
There are certain things
I could speak of...

1135
01:23:51,058 --> 01:23:54,026
...for a price.

1136
01:23:54,061 --> 01:23:57,363
Don't worry.
You'll get paid.

1137
01:23:57,397 --> 01:23:59,231
I would need to be.

1138
01:24:01,234 --> 01:24:04,303
I have seen things
within these walls

1139
01:24:04,338 --> 01:24:08,641
that would shock a brace
of courtesans.

1140
01:24:08,675 --> 01:24:11,677
Well, now, there's no need
to shock a courtesan, is there?

1141
01:24:11,712 --> 01:24:15,881
A brace of cardinals, perhaps.

1142
01:24:24,191 --> 01:24:26,158
[Door closing]

1143
01:24:26,193 --> 01:24:30,096
[Bell tolling outside]

1144
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:34,467
You were asked
for a judgment, I believe,

1145
01:24:34,501 --> 01:24:39,705
- some nights ago?
- Your Holiness, as an expert

1146
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:43,542
on canon law, when asked for
a judgment, I must provide it.

1147
01:24:43,577 --> 01:24:45,945
Please sit.

1148
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:52,451
I would have your opinion, then,

1149
01:24:52,486 --> 01:24:56,756
dear Johannes, on the expansion

1150
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:59,458
of the College of Cardinals.

1151
01:24:59,493 --> 01:25:03,796
It is the pope's prerogative
to appoint whom he wishes,

1152
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:06,065
- Your Holiness.
- To whatever number he wishes?

1153
01:25:06,099 --> 01:25:08,034
Ah, well,

1154
01:25:08,068 --> 01:25:10,569
how many cardinals did
His Holiness have in mind?

1155
01:25:10,604 --> 01:25:14,940
How many would be needed
to make it safe for our papacy?

1156
01:25:20,714 --> 01:25:22,982
- Oh, dear.
- Come, come, Johannes.

1157
01:25:23,016 --> 01:25:26,685
You must be aware of the plots
against us?

1158
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:29,121
You could even,
if viewed with an unkind eye,

1159
01:25:29,156 --> 01:25:31,791
be seen to be party to them.

1160
01:25:31,825 --> 01:25:34,693
When asked for an opinion,
Your Holiness, you know

1161
01:25:34,728 --> 01:25:36,695
that I must provide it.

1162
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:41,033
Ah. So,
your opinion, then.

1163
01:25:41,068 --> 01:25:46,405
How many new cardinals
to preserve our papacy?

1164
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:49,241
Umm...

1165
01:25:52,846 --> 01:25:56,715
- A baker's dozen, I would say.
- Mm!

1166
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,751
Thirteen!

1167
01:26:00,754 --> 01:26:04,790
And we can appoint them
all at once?

1168
01:26:04,825 --> 01:26:07,660
Without the vote of conclave?

1169
01:26:07,694 --> 01:26:10,296
Such a great number would need
a precedent.

1170
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:12,531
Oh.

1171
01:26:14,534 --> 01:26:17,670
Find one, then.

1172
01:26:17,704 --> 01:26:20,639
Your Holiness.

1173
01:26:20,674 --> 01:26:22,641
I have received advice

1174
01:26:22,676 --> 01:26:27,179
from our most supreme expert
in canon law,

1175
01:26:27,214 --> 01:26:30,349
that a pope's election may be
overturned

1176
01:26:30,383 --> 01:26:33,352
if we can provide evidence
of lechery,

1177
01:26:33,386 --> 01:26:36,422
both notorious and public.

1178
01:26:36,456 --> 01:26:39,058
That evidence
I present to you now.

1179
01:26:53,907 --> 01:26:55,774
Leave us, Micheletto.

1180
01:27:02,082 --> 01:27:05,484
[Doors closing]
And now, my dear,

1181
01:27:05,519 --> 01:27:07,987
tell us what you have witnessed.

1182
01:27:08,021 --> 01:27:12,658
There is a passage, connecting
the palace to the Vatican.

1183
01:27:12,692 --> 01:27:16,962
His Holiness makes use
of it... nightly.

1184
01:27:16,997 --> 01:27:19,298
And then?

1185
01:27:19,332 --> 01:27:24,637
He enters her bedroom
while she chastises herself.

1186
01:27:24,671 --> 01:27:29,008
And I blush to even describe
what happens next.

1187
01:27:29,042 --> 01:27:30,776
Spare us nothing.

1188
01:27:30,810 --> 01:27:34,280
I wanted seashells
and a sea horse.

1189
01:27:34,314 --> 01:27:36,282
But you have a sea horse,
my love.

1190
01:27:36,316 --> 01:27:38,651
No, I mean a real one.
Like your goat.

1191
01:27:38,685 --> 01:27:42,821
But real sea horses are tiny,
my love.

1192
01:27:42,856 --> 01:27:46,492
- Am I your love?
- I would dearly love you to be.

1193
01:27:46,526 --> 01:27:49,495
My mother hates you.

1194
01:27:49,529 --> 01:27:51,564
You will learn, my dear,

1195
01:27:51,598 --> 01:27:55,367
as women, we control
so little of our destiny.

1196
01:27:55,402 --> 01:27:58,003
- Men do.
- And?

1197
01:27:58,038 --> 01:28:02,441
The outcome is,
we hate each other.

1198
01:28:02,475 --> 01:28:05,611
- But we should not.
- Who should we hate, then?

1199
01:28:05,645 --> 01:28:09,481
- Men?
- No, my love.

1200
01:28:09,516 --> 01:28:13,118
It's in our nature to love them.

1201
01:28:13,153 --> 01:28:16,789
But we should protect ourselves
against them.

1202
01:28:16,823 --> 01:28:19,959
Against our feelings
towards them.

1203
01:28:19,993 --> 01:28:23,128
We will all of us,
one day, be replaced.

1204
01:28:23,163 --> 01:28:25,598
Are you giving me instruction?

1205
01:28:25,632 --> 01:28:29,201
- Would you like me to?
- I think I would.

1206
01:28:31,204 --> 01:28:35,174
- What weapons do I have with
which to protect myself? - Your beauty.

1207
01:28:35,208 --> 01:28:39,178
- Is that a weapon?
- It can be deadly,

1208
01:28:39,212 --> 01:28:41,146
when well used.

1209
01:28:41,181 --> 01:28:44,950
But beauty doesn't last forever.

1210
01:28:44,985 --> 01:28:47,987
Gone, like the snows
of last year.

1211
01:28:48,021 --> 01:28:51,023
- What else?
- When beauty fades?

1212
01:28:53,026 --> 01:28:54,493
Your wit.

1213
01:28:54,527 --> 01:28:56,662
Your intelligence.

1214
01:28:56,696 --> 01:29:00,466
- And I have those weapons?
- Oh, in abundance.

1215
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:05,771
You should cultivate them.
You will be married some day.

1216
01:29:05,805 --> 01:29:11,477
You may need them...
sooner than you think.

1217
01:29:11,511 --> 01:29:14,580
Is she pretty,
this piece of evidence?

1218
01:29:14,614 --> 01:29:17,383
She has her charms, My Lord.

1219
01:29:17,417 --> 01:29:20,486
Perhaps you could see
that she takes a vow of silence.

1220
01:29:22,822 --> 01:29:25,157
Would God forgive us, Micheletto?

1221
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:29,295
I know not the ways of God,
My Lord.

1222
01:29:29,329 --> 01:29:31,697
But you know the ways of silence.

bullfighting will be permitted

and the last Thursday
of every month.

[Cardinals murmuring]

1227
01:29:47,614 --> 01:29:51,417
And, finally,

1228
01:29:51,451 --> 01:29:55,120
the main business to hand.

1229
01:29:55,155 --> 01:29:58,257
Cardinal Della Rovere needs
no staff today, understand?

1230
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:01,360
For a day of meditation, he has
requested peace and silence.

1231
01:30:01,394 --> 01:30:03,362
You can tell the others.

1232
01:30:05,765 --> 01:30:07,566
Have you not heard?

1233
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,902
His Eminence needs no staff
today.

1234
01:30:09,936 --> 01:30:14,139
It is a day of meditation. - He has much
on his mind. - Too much, some might say.

1235
01:30:14,174 --> 01:30:18,277
Such is the burden of great office.
Until tomorrow, my friend.

1236
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,314
We wish to announce our decision

1237
01:30:22,349 --> 01:30:25,117
to expand the College
of Cardinals,

1238
01:30:25,151 --> 01:30:28,954
in view of the crippling
workload placed upon it

1239
01:30:28,988 --> 01:30:31,423
by our restructuring

1240
01:30:31,458 --> 01:30:34,626
of the affairs
of our Holy Mother Church.

1241
01:30:36,629 --> 01:30:40,599
Thirteen new servants of God...
[Cardinals gasping]

1242
01:30:40,633 --> 01:30:43,135
...will receive
the cardinal's biretta.

1243

Thirteen?!
[Angry exclamations]

1244
01:30:45,905 --> 01:30:47,606
We have judged it wise

1245
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:52,378
to strengthen the College
of Cardinals, given the enemies

1246
01:30:52,412 --> 01:30:54,880
who have wormed their way
within the Church of Rome.

1247
01:30:54,914 --> 01:30:56,882
This is against all precedence.

1248
01:30:56,916 --> 01:31:00,319
His Holiness will fill
the College with his favourites.

1249
01:31:00,353 --> 01:31:04,623
- I accuse His Holiness...
- Ohhh! Of what are we now accused?

1250
01:31:04,657 --> 01:31:07,059
Of an offence against canon law.

1251
01:31:07,093 --> 01:31:10,396
Against the Law
of our Holy Mother Church.

1252
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:14,533
Canon law?
But we have taken advice

1253
01:31:14,567 --> 01:31:19,271
from the most eminent
of all of our canon lawyers.

1254

Apple...

1255
01:31:38,124 --> 01:31:40,359
...or peach?

1256
01:31:40,393 --> 01:31:43,128
Peach, I think.

1257
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:48,967
I like peach.

1258
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:54,406
Eat it all.

1259
01:31:56,409 --> 01:32:00,946
The Council of Constance is
most clear on this matter.

1260

I refer you to Statute 42,
Paragraph 3...

In brief, I pray.

1262

His Holiness, the pope, may
expand the College

to any number
he deems appropriate,

if the burden of work
necessitates...

I challenge him to name them now!

- thus!
- With the force of a stallion.

The Bishop of Lucca,

named Cardinal Fiorentini.

Mascoli, will be named Cardinal Mascoli.

a cardinal?

I warn you, I have evidence
that will bring this house

- crashing down around your ears.
- Evidence?

Of lechery, transgressions,
both public and notorious!

Why, then, Cardinal,

1282

you must present it.

1289
01:33:41,781 --> 01:33:43,448
Only God can tell.

1290
01:33:49,122 --> 01:33:51,623
A candle, if you please!

1291
01:33:54,294 --> 01:33:56,728
Where is everyone?

1292
01:34:03,403 --> 01:34:05,404
Is there nobody about?

1293
01:34:09,342 --> 01:34:12,544
[Crickets chirping]

1294
01:34:12,579 --> 01:34:14,379
Dear Lord,

1295
01:34:14,414 --> 01:34:17,382
I pray for your strength
and guidance

1296
01:34:17,417 --> 01:34:20,218
in the trials to come.

1297
01:34:20,253 --> 01:34:22,688
Give us some sign

1298
01:34:22,722 --> 01:34:25,223
that Rome will be purified,

1299
01:34:25,258 --> 01:34:28,093
the Borgia stain will be
banished forever...

1300
01:34:39,439 --> 01:34:42,107
Guards! Guards!

1301
01:34:44,544 --> 01:34:46,511
Somebody!

1302
01:34:46,546 --> 01:34:48,680
Anybody!

1303
01:34:48,715 --> 01:34:50,215
Help!

1304
01:35:12,605 --> 01:35:15,574
Was the good cardinal known
for lechery?

1305
01:35:15,608 --> 01:35:18,110
He was discreet
in his affections, My Lord.

1306
01:35:18,144 --> 01:35:21,146
So discreet, indeed,

1307
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:25,884
he asked me to clear the house
of servants yesterday.

1308
01:35:25,918 --> 01:35:29,888
He must have had
lecherous intentions, then.

1309
01:35:29,922 --> 01:35:33,325
But I'm... shocked
that they ended in murder.

1310
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:35,327
And now he's fled, My Lord.

1311
01:35:35,361 --> 01:35:40,298
I would recommend discretion
in this matter.

1312
01:35:40,333 --> 01:35:43,035
The Church of Rome can
ill afford another scandal.

1313
01:35:46,272 --> 01:35:49,574
Perhaps he desired
her silence, My Lord.

1314
01:35:49,609 --> 01:35:54,112
He must have.
Poor girl...

1315
01:35:54,147 --> 01:35:56,982
Whom can one trust,
in this Rome of ours?

1316
01:35:57,016 --> 01:36:00,085
I believe trust needs
to be earned, My Lord.

1317
01:36:00,119 --> 01:36:02,220
Perhaps.

1318
01:36:04,223 --> 01:36:06,224
And perhaps it has been.

1319
01:36:13,805 --> 01:36:24,207
