1
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:46,994
-I'M NOTSCARED-

2
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,432
- Michele!
- Maria!

3
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,839
I fell!

4
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,909
Where are you going?

5
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,318
- They broke.
- I told you not to come.

6
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,635
Now what?

7
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,231
We'll tape them.
Let's go.

8
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,033
Come on, run!

9
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,352
- How gross!
- They passed by here.

10
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,475
There's a house!

11
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,117
Congratulations,
you finally made it.

12
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,511
My sister hurt herself.

13
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,553
- The others?
- They're down there.

14
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,078
- Who won?
- Skull.

15
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,028
- This place is mine.
- Why?

16
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,997
Because I saw it first.

17
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,954
Finders keepers...

18
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,873
Who's the rotten egg?

19
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,513
You, because you came last.

20
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,919
I had to stop
because my sister got hurt.

21
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,391
- You lose.
- Who has to pay up?

22
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,676
She does.

23
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,951
No fair, why always me?
Let's vote on it.

24
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,350
He can't always decide everything.

25
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,992
Let's vote, I say you lost.

26
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,793
- Me too.
- Me too.

27
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,073
- Me too.
- Me too.

28
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,596
See?

29
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,989
So what do I have to do?

30
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,399
- Show it to us.
- No way!

31
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,399
- What does she have to show us?
- Shhh!

32
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,280
- You lost, so do it.
- No.

33
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,671
No?

34
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,278
Aren't you going to say anything?

35
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,912
Alright, but I won't play
with you anymore, jerks!

36
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,789
- Are you crying?
- No.

37
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,116
Stop!

38
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,234
I'll pay up, I came last.

39
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,389
Fuck!

40
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,991
Walk across that.

41
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,071
He was the Lizard Man,..

42
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,991
..he could walk on walls.

43
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,834
Then he became the Glass Man,
if he falls he breaks.

44
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,036
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.

45
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,629
Leap onto that branch
and climb down.

46
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,310
Michele,..

47
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,788
..give me my glasses.

48
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,916
- I lost them.
- Mom will kill you.

49
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,829
Wait here.

50
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,831
A cave filled with gold and gems.

51
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,989
- Did you find them?
- Run, we're late.

52
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,629
There's Mom.

53
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,432
Where'd you go?
I was searching for you!

54
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,433
How many times I gotta tell you
to stay nearby?

55
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,438
Michele, this time....

56
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,440
- We went....
- Home, right now!

57
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,753
Dad's here!

58
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,236
Dad!

59
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,669
You're heavy!
Daddy's doll, gimme a kiss.

60
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,838
Where were you?

61
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,990
Playing by the stream.
How long are you staying?

62
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,199
For a bit. You broke 'em?

63
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,115
- Again?
- She fell.

64
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,196
We can fix them with tape.

65
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,193
- Michele, what did I tell you?
- Never mind.

66
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,793
Did you do your push-ups?

67
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,193
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, I did.

68
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,228
We'll see, if you don't beat me,
no present for you.

69
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,229
- A present? What present?
- What present? - You'll see.

70
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,715
So...

71
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,391
Christ, are your muscles
made of butter?

72
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,711
Come on.

73
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,318
You're a sissy.

74
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,832
Maria, help him out.

75
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,434
Give us the present now!

76
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,638
Anna, get the box.

77
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,035
Easy!

78
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,759
- A boat.
- No.

79
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,635
It ain't no boat, it's a gondola.

80
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,036
- What's that?
- A boat you only find in Venice.

81
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,155
- With only one oar?
- What's an oar?

82
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,432
A stick that moves the boat.

83
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,353
- Pretty!
- No.

84
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,752
You can't play with this.

85
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:50,150
The Police
from the Artistic Heritage Unit..

86
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,879
..recovered two precious
16th century sculptures..

87
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,270
..attributed to Benvenuto Cellini.

88
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,914
Whose turn to get the wine?

89
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,878
- Maria's. - I don't feel like it.
You go. - No!

90
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,000
- It's your turn.
- I'm not going.

91
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,310
- Why not?
- My head hurts.

92
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,078
That's what you always say!

93
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,709
Shut up, let me hear!

94
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,308
Knock it off! Go, Michele.

95
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,952
It's not fair.

96
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,834
After the defeat
of the fencing team in Hamburg....

97
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,752
What happened?

98
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,396
It's her turn to get the wine.

99
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,439
In war, know how they'd decide
who went on deadly missions?

100
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,756
Whoever picks the broken one,
has to go.

101
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,872
It's your turn!

102
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,949
You lost, go get the wine.

103
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,675
So they bury him..

104
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,955
..and he remains
in the belly of the earth..

105
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,070
..among secrets, corpses, bones,
skeletons, and darkness.

106
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,033
Where were you?
Your Mom's looking for you.

107
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,952
They're mad.

108
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,351
Are the shoes comfy?

109
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,431
We'll buy them.

110
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,278
Hope I can convince my Mom,
they're really cute.

111
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,958
- Anna, what do you think?
- Let me see. What do you think?

112
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,072
How much you want for these?

113
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,590
- How much are they?
- It's a good brand.

114
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,591
I've got other models, too.

115
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,596
Pino, your son's here.

116
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,274
- Where were you?
- Wandering around.

117
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,476
Wandering like hell!
You know what time it is?

118
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,755
It's almost 2!
No one knew where you were.

119
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,068
Your Mom went looking for you.

120
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,152
You gotta stop doing
whatever the fuck you please!

121
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,232
If you wanna do as you please,
then leave.

122
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,514
Get lost.

123
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,908
Get lost!

124
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,833
Michele, come down!

125
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,036
- What do you want?
- Dinner's ready.

126
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,237
Tell them I'm not their son anymore,
I'm not coming back.

127
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,960
- You're not my brother either?
- No!

128
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,231
- Then can I have your comic books?
- No.

129
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,948
That has nothing to do with it.

130
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,310
Mom will get mad.

131
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,799
- Where's Dad?
- He went out, he'll be back late.

132
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,238
- What's for dinner?
- Mashed potatoes and eggs.

133
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,600
Good morning!

134
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,875
Did you fall out of bed?

135
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,269
- I had lots on my mind.
- What was on your mind?

136
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,191
Give daddy a kiss.

137
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,519
- I thought you were mad.
- What was on your mind?

138
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,551
- Tell us.
- Sad thoughts.

139
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,429
Get ready 'cause tonight
we're gonna arm wrestle.

140
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,755
Anna!

141
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,232
Buy me some sausages.

142
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,751
- Dad, when will you be back?
- Late!

143
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,389
Michele.

144
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,397
One, two, three, red light!

145
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,989
Michele.

146
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,917
- What are you doing?
- I'm not playing anymore.

147
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,919
Want me to come along?

148
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,193
Forget about him.

149
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,596
Water...

150
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,512
Are you alive?

151
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,717
- Water... - What did you say?
I didn't understand.

152
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,517
- Water.
- You're thirsty! You want water?

153
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,149
- Thirsty.
- Wait.

154
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,948
Hungry.

155
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,392
You're hungry?
I don't have anything to eat.

156
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,030
I have to go home now.

157
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,631
If you want,
I'll bring something tomorrow.

158
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,950
Are you a child?

159
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,068
What are you doing here?

160
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,070
I know you.
You're Amitrano's son, right?

161
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,199
You better not come here no more.
If I see you again....

162
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,793
See them things?

163
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,312
They're always hungry,
they even eat bones.

164
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,150
Michele...

165
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,349
- What are you doing?
- Nothing, just playing.

166
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,672
Put everything back.

167
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,994
- I don't want anymore.
- Eat your meat.

168
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,275
It gives me a headache.

169
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,397
- I can't take this anymore!
- Anna... If she doesn't want it...

170
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,118
No big deal.

171
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,278
Someone's coming in a few days.

172
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,678
So no fuss and no whining.

173
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,353
Who is it?

174
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,470
A friend.

175
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,478
- What's his name?
- Sergio.

176
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,793
What a funny name.

177
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,914
A Dad and Mom
are expecting a baby.

178
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,916
But instead, two are born,
one blond, one brunet.

179
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,115
The brunet is normal,
the blond is crazy.

180
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,989
When she nurses him,
he bites her and draws blood.

181
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,673
The Mom doesn't want him anymore.

182
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,069
So she tells the Dad to kill him.

183
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,833
The Dad takes him up
to a tall mountain,..

184
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,753
..but he can't stab him
because it's a sin.

185
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,233
So he digs a hole
and puts him in it.

186
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,636
He brings him water and food
so he won't die.

187
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,909
So he..

188
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,156
..won't... die.

189
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,875
Hi, Michele.

190
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,196
What do you need?

191
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,315
What can I buy with 500 liras?

192
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,390
Don't know,
depends on what you need.

193
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,911
- Something good,
do you have chocolate cookies? - No.

194
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,908
Sweets are over there.

195
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,717
A doughnut, a chocolate bar...

196
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,993
Or a Kit Kat.

197
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,439
They're all good.

198
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,754
- Assunta...
- What is it?

199
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,549
If someone's hungry,
what can they buy with 500 liras?

200
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,275
They can buy bread.

201
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,757
When someone's hungry,
they buy bread.

202
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,995
I wanted to ask you:

203
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:42,715
..do you know Felice,
Skull's brother? Felice Natale.

204
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,548
I hate him.

205
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,276
Is he the one who feeds you?

206
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,869
I saw him driving away from here,..

207
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,109
..so I thought....

208
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,832
I'm going home now.

209
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,196
Okay?

210
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,395
Bye bye.

211
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,998
Are you deaf?

212
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,234
Listen. Sorry.
I thought of something.

213
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,833
If you won't eat the bread,
will you give it back?

214
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:23,195
Let me explain. If Felice comes
and finds it, he'll figure it out.

215
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,116
Then I'll come get it.

216
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,710
Listen...

217
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,118
What's your name?

218
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,637
What's your Dad's name?
Mine is named Pino.

219
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,954
Is your Dad named Pino too,
by chance?

220
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,273
- I'm leaving.
- Coons...

221
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,673
Did you say something?

222
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,753
I don't understand.

223
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,193
- Coons...
- Coons?

224
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,072
- What do you mean?
- Raccoons.

225
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,190
If you leave the window open,
raccoons will come in..

226
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:57,115
..and steal cakes, cookies...
- There are no coons here.

227
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,191
Raccoons can bite people.

228
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,031
Did you eat
a piece of meat yesterday?

229
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,959
It's very important.

230
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,870
Are you my Guardian Angel?

231
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,957
I'm not an angel.
What's a Guardian Angel?

232
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,790
The one who says true things.

233
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,594
You can tell me,
I won't tell anyone.

234
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,238
I'm not an angel.
I'm Michele.

235
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,232
Michele Amitrano, fifth grade.

236
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,592
Dead?

237
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,989
- What?
- Am I dead?

238
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,429
- Dead? What?
- I'm dead!

239
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,712
I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead!

240
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:47,036
I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead!

241
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,875
Remember when Mrs. Destani..

242
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,157
..told us about the miracle
of Lazarus? - Yes.

243
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,394
When Lazarus came back to life,
did he know he'd been dead?

244
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,791
No, I guess he thought he felt ill.

245
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,830
Do you think only Jesus can bring
the dead back to life?

246
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,629
Dunno, but my Aunt
told me a true story.

247
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,312
Once, someone's son died
all mangled under a car.

248
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,392
The Dad couldn't handle it,
he cried all day.

249
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,395
He gave a psychic all his money
to bring his son back to life.

250
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,155
So the psychic said: "Go home,
your son will return tonight".

251
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,031
The Dad waited,
but the son didn't return,..

252
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,158
..so he went to bed.

253
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,431
Then he heard steps in the kitchen.

254
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,673
He got up
and saw his mangled son,..

255
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,677
..with his brains dripping out.

256
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,954
His son said he hated him,
it was his fault he died.

257
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,676
He left him in the street
to go chase after women.

258
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,069
And then?

259
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,277
So his Dad set him on fire
with gasoline.

260
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,996
- He did good.
- Sure did.

261
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,159
- What are you doing?
- I have to pee, go to sleep.

262
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,949
- What do they say in Milan? - What
the hell do you want them to say?

263
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,719
They said it would end soon,..

264
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,234
..it's been months! What's going on?
I don't understand!

265
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,995
You don't need to understand. The less
you think, the less you'll screw up.

266
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,116
It'll take time.

267
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,997
It might take six months.

268
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,355
- Six months? - Six months,
a year, whatever it takes.

269
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,158
My ass!

270
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,152
Shut up!
They ain't telling us anything!

271
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,514
You don't need to know anything.

272
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,996
You just have
to keep the kid hidden.

273
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,511
Hide him and stay cool.

274
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,230
You've fucked up
over and over again.

275
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,635
He's the stupidest of all.

276
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,355
Like I said, you're not capable.

277
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,231
Relax.

278
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,629
Relax? They ain't paying!

279
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,360
They said Carducci had money
coming out of his ass.

280
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,111
Bullshit!

281
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,031
Shut up!

282
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,154
You're the worst here,
'cause you think.

283
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,753
- Me?
- Yes.

284
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,516
Fuck you, expert my ass.

285
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,399
You're an idiot, let me tell you!

286
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,748
The news!

287
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,032
Anna, turn off the light.
Turn up the volume.

288
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,439
Good evening.
Human rights defense..

289
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,433
..and patience in negotiations,
Carter says in Berlin.

290
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,831
In Bonn tomorrow, the lndustrialized
Countries Summit begins.

291
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,358
Alarm in Trent for a toxic cloud....

292
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,310
I'll have one.

293
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,914
They ain't gonna talk about it
today either.

294
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,275
- They didn't yesterday.
- Well?

295
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,473
I can't hear a thing.

296
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,153
Here it is!

297
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,839
Throughout the whole region,
the search continues..

298
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,798
..for little Filippo,
kidnapped in Milan.

299
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,869
The Police are following new leads
which seem to be promising.

300
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,874
We will now air Luisa Carducci's
appeal to the kidnappers.

301
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,549
What the fuck does she want?

302
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,517
I'm Filippo's mother.

303
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,995
I'm speaking
to my son's kidnappers.

304
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,716
I implore you, don't hurt him.

305
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,310
He's a good boy,
well mannered, and very shy.

306
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,716
I implore you, treat him well.

307
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,310
The sum requested is steep,..

308
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,030
..even for our family.
- They'll cough up the money.

309
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,478
You threatened to cut his ear off.

310
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,358
I beg you not to do it.

311
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,954
I must make another request:

312
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:35,196
..tell Filippo his Mom and Dad
love him dearly..

313
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,113
..and always think of him.
- We'll cut off two ears!

314
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:38,871
Two!

315
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,509
Who are you?

316
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,233
I'm Michele, Michele Amitrano.

317
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,032
Sounds like the name of a singer.

318
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,032
I'm Materia Sergio.

319
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,556
Pleased to meet you.

320
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,274
Didn't they ever teach you to knock?

321
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,675
Sorry.

322
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,395
- Are you Pino's son?
- What?

323
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,272
- Are you Pino's son?
- Yes.

324
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,078
You're a quiet kid.

325
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,996
I like quiet kids.

326
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,793
Are you obedient, too?

327
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,755
Then close the door and piss off.

328
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,400
- What?
- Close the door and piss off!

329
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,915
Mom!

330
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,110
Mom!

331
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,197
- Who's that in the bathroom?
- Let go of me!

332
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,636
It's Sergio, your Dad's friend,
he told you already.

333
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,558
- How long is he staying?
- A few days.

334
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,758
Pass me the other stuff.

335
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,040
- Where will he sleep?
- In your sister's bed.

336
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,350
- And her?
- With us.

337
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,599
Pass it here.

338
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,268
- And me?
- In your room.

339
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,557
I don't want to sleep with him!

340
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,359
I want to sleep in your bed, too.

341
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,873
Don't be silly.

342
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,476
You're too big,
how are you gonna fit?

343
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,271
- I'll make myself small.
- Enough already!

344
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,515
Come here.

345
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,990
Come.

346
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,109
I can't take it anymore.

347
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,229
If you only knew...

348
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,949
Don't you make it worse,
do it for me.

349
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,351
- Come on!
- It's not fair.

350
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,358
But it's not for long.
