1
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,310
- I got Mr Raymond's cigarettes.
- Go on in the back.

2
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,349
Kid, give me my cigarettes.

3
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,596
Wait, wait, wait! Hold it.

4
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,351
What's this kid doing here?
Get out before I kick your little ass.

5
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,993
You ain't kicking shit.

6
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,029
Don't worry about him.
He runs errands for me.

7
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,677
I don't care who he is or what he does.
Kids bring me bad luck.

8
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,271
The bet is fading. Stop talking and shoot
the dice. You're fucking up the game.

9
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,077
I ain't shooting shit. I told you kids
bring me bad luck. I can't stand them.

10
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,955
Now, get the fuck out of here
before I kick your ass.

11
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,869
You ain't whupping shit. Shoot the dice,
you snaggle-toothed motherfucker.

12
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,636
All right, l'm going to shoot.

13
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,435
But l'd better not crap.
That's all I know, l'd better not crap.

14
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,953
Come on, 6. l've been waiting all night.
Baby needs shoes, new clothes.

15
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,472
- And you need some teeth.
- Shoot the goddamn dice, man!

16
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,118
l'm going to shoot the damn dice.
l'll send every one of you home broke.

17
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,272
Come on, 6, with your bad ass.
Come on!

18
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,391
Craps!

19
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,712
What are you doing with this kid in here?
Didn't I say they're bad luck?

20
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,357
What's that sign say? 'Ray's Place'.
That's me. This is my place.

21
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,790
I have in here whoever I want.

22
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,515
You lost. So pass the dice,
or buy them from this motherfucker.

23
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,518
- And I ain't selling.
- I ain't buying.

24
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,350
l'm going to shoot this again and
you're going to get this kid out of here.

25
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,951
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Man, look, you shot, you lost.

26
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,913
We'd have paid you
if you won, but you lost.

27
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,918
Now, go home and brush that tooth.

28
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,588
You think that's funny?

29
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,429
I told you
I couldn't stand kids in the room.

30
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,916
- They're bad luck. You wouldn't listen.
- l'm listening.

31
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,394
Listen to this.

32
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,594
I want back all the money
I lost tonight plus what you took in.

33
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,679
Do you understand me,
you smooth-talking son of a bitch?

34
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,238
Tell that old frog-faced dude to go
out there and bring back the money.

35
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,274
Tell him, or l'll stick your ass,
and l'm going to stick him,

36
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:49,157
and l'll stick this little Yankee ass,
bad-luck motherfucker standing here.

37
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,035
Then you'll have to stick us
because I ain't giving you shit.

38
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,233
Wait! Before you do,
I just want to tell you one thing.

39
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,558
Tell me what, punk?
What the fuck do you want to tell me?

40
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,830
What do you want to tell me?

41
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,271
- It slips my mind.
- Slips your mind?

42
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,036
Holy shit!

43
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,078
Goddamn. I guess
he does have bad luck with kids.

44
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,516
He was going to stab us, so I shot him.

45
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,393
Bennie, Slim, Moses, would you help
get this dead motherfucker out, please?

46
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,471
The game's over for tonight.
l'm taking this boy home to his mother.

47
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,033
My mama's dead.

48
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,151
- Well, your daddy.
- My father's dead, too.

49
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,033
- Did you kill them?
- No, they're just dead.

50
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,677
Give me that pistol.
Where do you stay?

51
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,589
- I don't live nowhere.
- You can stay with me for a while.

52
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,400
I wouldn't trust him in the house.

53
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,751
- He's all right. Give me five!
- I ain't giving you shit.

54
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,115
He's one hell of a motherfucker.

55
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,833
Come on.

56
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,679
- l'll clean up.
- Please.

57
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,792
So you shot him.
How about some ice cream?

58
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,398
CLUB SUGAR RA Y

59
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,472
- Ray, look. Tommy is coming.
- Where?

60
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,558
- Over there.
- Oh, shit!

61
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,590
- Mr Smalls, good evening.
- My man. How are you doing, brother?

62
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,872
- Thank you.
- Do you want me to kick his ass?

63
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,470
No, don't kick his ass.
Thank you, Roberto.

64
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,679
It looks like the competition
has stopped by to check us out.

65
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,313
That's Tommy Smalls.
He runs the Pitty Pat Club.

66
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,753
I know that's Smalls, but who's
that girl with him? She is beautiful.

67
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,758
Wait a minute.
Don't mess around with her.

68
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,114
That's the mistress of a famous
gangster named Bugsy Calhoune.

69
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,880
That's Calhoune's girl?

70
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,036
I heard about her.

71
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,153
What would a woman that fine
want with a fat, nasty, greasy,

72
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,715
fat, stank, bloated,

73
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,630
cheesy-backed, twelve-sandwich-eating
bastard like him?

74
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,435
Maybe she likes fat guys.
Want to check them out?

75
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,914
I think I will.

76
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,353
Just check her out. I mean, don't fuck
with her. You'll get in trouble.

77
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,478
- May I be of some assistance?
- No, no. Not at all, Mr Quick.

78
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,394
We're just enjoying the night out.

79
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,473
- You boys ain't open tonight?
- We wanted a change of atmosphere.

80
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,593
l'm sure you understand that,
Mr Quick.

81
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,910
My name is Quick.

82
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,112
My name is Dominique La Rue,
Mr Quick.

83
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,552
- Charmed to make your acquaintance.
- La Rue, that's a French name, right?

84
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,719
Creole. Born and raised in Louisiana.

85
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,239
Is that right?

86
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,351
- Tommy Smalls.
- Sugar Ray.

87
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,199
How's the laugh?
I don't believe we've met.

88
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,234
- Dominique La Rue.
- Tommy, would you like a table?

89
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,635
Please. Thank you very much.

90
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,630
Curtis! Get Mr Smalls and his party
one of our best tables.

91
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,115
You got it, sir. Right this way.

92
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,999
- Didn't I ask you not to mess with her?
- I just said hi.

93
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,079
I know, but you got a way of saying hi.
Just check them out.

94
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,236
All right. l'm cool.

95
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,990
Ray, I think you'd better
go over to Bennie's crap table.

96
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,760
- People are complaining about him.
- Why?

97
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,599
- His glasses.
- I got them yesterday.

98
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,078
I know, but he won't wear them.
He says he don't need to.

99
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,273
No more bets.
The dice are coming out. Let them roll.

100
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,352
- The point is four.
- It was seven, man!

101
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,031
l'm sorry, forgive me. That's a seven.
Pay everybody. All right.

102
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,634
Dice coming out. Get your bets down.
All right, shake them up.

103
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,430
- Five is the point.
- Five? That is a nine, man!

104
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,235
l've got something in my eye.

105
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,070
- Get it out, you blind motherfucker!
- No more 'motherfuckers', you hear?

106
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,029
We're going to shoot the dice now.
Get your bets down.

107
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,148
- Eleven.
- What's the matter with you?

108
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,828
That's six, man!

109
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,793
- Don't scream.
- What are you doing?

110
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,116
- How's it going, Bennie?
- Real good.

111
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,915
Wally, take over for Bennie.
I want to speak to him.

112
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,680
Gentlemen, enjoy the game.

113
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,874
- How's it going?
- Real good.

114
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,594
l'm getting complaints.

115
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,349
That's them suckers losing their money.
l'm Bennie 'Snake Eyes' Wilson.

116
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,870
I can call the dice before they roll.
Done it for 40 years.

117
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,038
I know, Snake Eyes,
but put on your glasses.

118
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,392
- I don't need no glasses.
- I know. Just do me a favour.

119
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,119
- Yes, there you go. You look good.
- I don't feel no different.

120
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,709
Well, let's try it.

121
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,274
- Enjoy the game, gentlemen.
- Fuck you all, man.

122
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,870
It doesn't make sense, Bugs.

123
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,037
What's that, Tony?
What doesn't make sense?

124
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,994
Business isn't great, but the crowd
is the same the last two weeks,

125
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,714
yet we're not clearing
what we used to.

126
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,878
It makes sense.
Smalls is skimming off the top.

127
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,789
- He doesn't have the balls.
- Don't underestimate Tommy.

128
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,470
He's got huge balls,
big fucking huge balls.

129
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,069
But he's stupid.

130
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,990
All told, he beat me
for five grand last month. Check.

131
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,431
Smalls wouldn't do that.
I hand-picked him myself.

132
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,712
You made a mistake with him.
A big mistake.

133
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,758
You hand-picked him?

134
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,071
I guess that makes you
kind of responsible.

135
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,273
- Tell me about Sugar Ray's.
- I figure he's pulling in 10, 15 a week.

136
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,554
- Does he run it alone?
- His son's with him. His name's Quick.

137
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,473
Checkmate.

138
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,437
Is that right?

139
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,874
I think we should have Mr Cantone
pay Mr Sugar Ray a visit.

140
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,475
Kind of feel him out.

141
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,629
We have to get rid of his establishment.
It's hurting my business.

142
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,719
- lt's done. l'll call Cantone right now.
- Wait a minute.

143
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,755
About Tommy Smalls. You brought him
to me, so the money I lost is your fault.

144
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,638
Come here.

145
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,556
Put your hand on the edge.

146
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,793
Nobody steals from me.

147
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,552
The next time you bring somebody
crooked in, l'm going to fucking kill you.

148
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,035
- Understand?
- Yes.

149
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,880
Let Joey take a look at it.

150
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,517
- Joey, is it broke?
- Yes, it's broke pretty good.

151
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,273
- How's your right hand? OK?
- lt's OK.

152
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,837
Good. I want you to take care
of Smalls as soon as possible.

153
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,315
Take care of your bad hand first,

154
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,593
then take your good hand
and cut Tommy's throat

155
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,756
from here...

156
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,996
...to here.

157
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,398
700 at the bar,
1,300 at the crap tables.

158
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,716
- What did we do on the door?
- About 300.

159
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,755
- Vera hasn't brought the girl's money.
- Go tell Vera to bring her ass in here.

160
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,349
What is wrong with her, Sugar?

161
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,075
- What's with Tommy Smalls?
- I don't know. I put Romeo on him.

162
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,113
Nothing much, he had a few drinks,

163
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,471
dropped 200 at the crap table,
made a phone call and left.

164
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,593
- Don't worry.
- l'm not worried, just a little concerned.

165
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,713
Calhoune's number-one boy
drops by to snoop a little bit.

166
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:06,552
That makes me uncomfortable.
You guys keep your eyes out, OK?

167
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,028
Vera, you know we tally up at 4 o'clock.
What is your problem?

168
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,711
Kiss my ass. I have to watch
my girls until the last trick is gone.

169
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,755
I won't ask a customer to roll over
so I can punch a goddamn clock.

170
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,239
This is your place, but I am in charge
of the girls. Just kiss my ass.

171
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,151
Sugar, stop doing that. Don't do that.

172
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,634
- How did we do tonight?
- We made 200.

173
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,630
200? You girls have been back there
all night. How come only 200?

174
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,470
Kiss my ass. I say nothing when
the crap tables and the bar are short.

175
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,638
That's because
just the girls come up short.

176
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,073
- Calm down, Vera.
- Kiss my ass. What's Quick saying?

177
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,034
- You're in charge of the girls, right?
- I am in charge of the girls.

178
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,800
- Are you in charge of the girls?
- I am.

179
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,958
The girls are always coming up short.

180
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,789
Even when the place is packed
the girls come up short.

181
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,276
Either you or them
have a problem with arithmetic.

182
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,278
Are you saying l'm stealing?

183
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,711
The man didn't say that.
Sit down and shut up.

184
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:35,836
You shut up, Bennie. l'd tell you to kiss
my ass, but you're too blind to find it.

185
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,439
Fuck you, bitch.

186
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,950
- Me and you got to step out back.
- It was a misunderstanding.

187
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,551
No, it ain't no misunderstanding.
Quick just accused me of stealing.

188
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,390
If you want to defend Quick,
then we can all be fighting tonight.

189
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,273
Bring your ass, nigger. Come on.

190
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,074
Bring your ass. Get up and come on.

191
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,272
All right, bitch, you want to fight?
We'll fight, then.

192
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,472
You fat motherfucker,
l'm tired of your shit!

193
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,990
l'm going to beat the shit
out of your ass.

194
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,357
Don't hold me, Sugar.
No, Sugar, let me go!

195
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,314
- Just scaring her a little. Don't hold me!
- You fucking with a heavyweight.

196
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,912
Treating me like l'm some kind of dog.
l'll kick his ass.

197
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,830
Come on. Come on!

198
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,040
Come on. Don't you want to talk?

199
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,471
You've insulted me
and l've got to kick your ass.

200
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,752
And afterwards
I don't want no hard feelings.

201
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,631
What is wrong with you?

202
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,196
What is wrong with you?
You accused me of stealing.

203
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,914
Only thing l'm stealing is your face.

204
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,589
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Oh, yeah...

205
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,914
That's what l'm talking about.

206
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,237
Come on, sucker. Let's get it on.

207
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,194
You want to fight?

208
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,837
Come on. l'm going to beat the shit
out of your ass, motherfucker.

209
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,710
- You punch people in the eyes? Bitch.
- Is that all you got?

210
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,878
You think that's all?
l'm going to blast your teeth out.

211
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,437
- Nigger, you hit like a bitch.
- You're slower than you thought.

212
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,349
I punch like a bitch, OK?
I punch like a bitch?

213
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,869
Say goodnight to this bitch now.

214
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,748
You're going to have to learn
to respect me.

215
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,312
And the next time...

216
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,359
...you accuse me of stealing,
l'll kick your ass again.

217
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,511
You crazy bitch.

218
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,673
Oh, you want to hit people
with garbage cans?

219
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,590
Now l've got to cut you.

220
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,916
Vera, put that razor away.

221
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,670
Put it away, or l'll blow
your pinkie toe off.

222
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,077
Now you're going to shoot me
in my pinkie toe.

223
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,236
l'm not playing with you.

224
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,355
l'll blow that little black, crusty toe
off your foot. Put the razor away!

225
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,438
You must be crazy
to pull your gun on me.

226
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,760
You'll be the biggest limping bitch
in Harlem if you don't stop. Put it away.

227
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,748
Go ahead, shoot.
Here it is. Shoot, Quick.

228
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,951
Take your best shot.

229
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,588
- You didn't have to shoot her.
- She was trying to kill me.

230
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,268
She was trying to scare you.

231
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,153
That bitch was going
to cut me with a razor.

232
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,797
I usually kill over something like that.
I don't want to talk about it.

233
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,434
Vera whipped your ass.

234
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,677
If you hadn't had that gun,
she'd still be doing it.

235
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,598
You laugh at the wrong shit.

236
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,749
He shot my pinkie toe. l'm gonna put
my foot in your ass. l'll kill him.

237
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,919
Be careful taking her out of here.
Don't kill anyone, just relax.

238
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,072
Vera, we're going to find your toe.

239
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,431
You've got to stop overreacting.

240
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,676
- Overreacting?
- Yes.

241
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,149
- Get your old ass in the car.
- Fuck you.

242
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,716
Next time you fight,
pick on somebody your own size.

243
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,159
- Goodnight, guys. Take it easy.
- Goodnight, Sugar.

244
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,988
Hello, Raymond. How are you doing?

245
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,280
My name is Sergeant Phil Cantone.

246
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,514
- What are you doing in my place?
- I needed to speak with you, Ray.

247
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,315
You wouldn't want me standing around
in this neighbourhood.

248
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,750
A fellow could get hurt.

249
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,558
And please, put the gun down, Ray.

250
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,673
Coloured guys with guns
make me nervous.

251
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,358
So, you have a nice house here, Ray.
Real nice.

252
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,918
So, Sergeant Cantone,
how can I help you?

253
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,516
Jesus, that's a beautiful suit.
What is that, Macy's?

254
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,191
This is tailor-made. If you want
my tailor's number, I can give...

255
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,870
No. No, I buy off the rack.

256
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,392
No, get out of here.
Your clothes, they fit you so well.

257
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,871
That's funny.

258
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,549
I mean, that's really funny.

259
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,435
My clothes fit me well?
Did you used to be a nightclub comic?

260
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,872
No, I owned a candy store.
For 20 years.

261
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,719
- The candy business?
- 20 years.

262
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,549
- Are you serious?
- 20 years.

263
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,035
Well, that's strange.

264
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,236
Because somebody told me you run
an after-hours club, 'Club Sugar Ray's'.

265
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,468
Hottest spot in Harlem. They told me
you can gamble, drink, fuck, dance.

266
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,910
Fuck and dance at my place?

267
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,396
You can do anyhing there.
Aren't you that Sugar Ray?

268
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,875
No, that's not me.

269
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,950
l'm sorry. l'm in the wrong place.
I thought you were that Sugar Ray.

270
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,755
The candy business? That's great.

271
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,909
You live in a great place and wear
tailor-made suits from selling candy.

272
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,078
The candy business is something else.

273
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,193
l'll say. There can't be a nigger
with a healthy tooth in his mouth.

274
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,109
Oh, well... l'll see you later, Ray.

275
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,953
You know, maybe I should
go into the candy business, too.

276
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,436
l'd like to wear nice clothes
and live in a place like this.

277
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,236
I know a lot about candy.
Are you looking for a partner, Ray?

278
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,071
No, I don't think so.

279
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,597
'Sugar Phil's Candy Store'.

280
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,111
I like that!

281
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,275
Maybe l'm just dreaming, Ray.
l'm a cop, for Christ's sake.

282
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,318
See you later.

283
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,189
I bet you will.

284
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,672
Shit.

285
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,874
Why would Calhoune
care about your place

286
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,197
when he owns almost
every after-hours spot in the city?

287
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,278
I don't know, maybe he wants more.

288
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,756
We're going to have to relocate,
I know that.

289
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,669
Why do we have to relocate?
I don't want to leave New York.

290
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,032
I don't either, but Calhoune
ain't the type you fuck with.

291
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,754
Hey, it's the champ!

292
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,278
Next week you knock that boy out!

293
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,835
Hey, Sugar Ray!

294
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,475
- How you doing, Champ?
- What's going on?

295
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,878
Hello, gentlemen...ladies.

296
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,914
- How is everybody doing?
- Fine. You ready for next week?

297
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,240
Ready? Yeah.

298
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,073
l'm ready.

299
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,636
l'm betting a lot of money on you.

300
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,796
Well...

301
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,116
...you get ready to be a rich nigger.

302
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,959
You see, 'cause...

303
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,349
...come next week...

304
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,629
...l'm knocking somebody
the fuck out.

305
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,877
- You understand what l'm saying?
- I understand now.

306
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,230
It took a while, but I got it.

307
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:18,231
Well, you people enjoy your meal.
Come on, babies.

308
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,476
Take care, Champ.

309
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:26,192
That nigger's going to kill that white boy.
I saw him fight 33 rounds.

310
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,073
A lot of people think
that white boy got a shot.

311
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,430
He's got a shot. In his ass.

312
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,276
We'll make a killing with those odds.

313
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,438
All the white people
will bet on that white boy.

314
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,634
Gambling is where it's at. If we move,
we should concentrate on that.

315
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,674
Give up the joy houses and after-hours
spots. Concentrate on gambling.

316
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,758
About this move,
we're jumping the gun.

317
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,112
Smalls comes here and a cop
visits the apartment. So we pack up?

318
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,393
- We don't know if he's with Calhoune.
- It could all be coincidence.

319
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,149
Leaving New York
is the last thing we should do.

320
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,715
I ain't afraid of Smalls or Calhoune.

321
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:12,677
That's because you're young and full
of vigour and life...and a little ignorant.

322
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,158
Calhoune can kill you
by snapping his fucking fingers.

323
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,113
Oh, man, fuck Calhoune.

324
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,709
You know, you have to slow down.

325
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,799
We're in the very small leagues here.
Very small.

326
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,788
It's a big world outside Sugar Hill.
You know nothing about it.

327
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,154
I do know this, when the majors want
to play where you're playing, you move.

328
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,150
That's bullshit. Why should we build
the market up for somebody else?

329
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,831
It's all illegal anyway. l'm not afraid
of Calhoune. I have a gun, too.

330
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,669
You got a gun, he's got one.
His boys and his cops got guns.

331
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,192
He has judges on his payroll.
Don't you feel a little uncomfortable?

332
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,269
You are a bad motherfucker. But that's
a hundred guns against your gun.

333
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,313
That's got to change something
in your mind.

334
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,117
It's not how many people you shoot,

335
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,436
it's who you shoot.

336
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,110
I got to go to the bathroom.

337
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,158
Are you still worrying about the club?

338
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,470
No, l'm thinking about Quick.

339
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,240
He's so damn hot-headed.

340
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,034
Everything I say to him means nothing.

341
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,352
Baby.

342
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,269
He's young. He's going to calm down.

343
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,439
He's...confused or something.

344
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,915
He's so damn ambitious.

345
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,756
Baby, you know...

346
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,590
- There's nothing wrong with ambition.
- It is in the wrong circles.

347
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,991
Sugar Ray.

348
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,596
Are we going to talk
about your son all night?

349
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,189
Or are you going to make love to me?

350
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,188
Why don't we make love...

351
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,994
...and talk about my son
in the morning?

352
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,717
Well...

353
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,672
What if we made love all night...

354
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,637
...and then made love all morning?

355
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,719
And all afternoon?

356
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,832
What if we made love real hard
for 35 minutes

357
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,113
and drop off
into a deep coma-like sleep?

358
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,636
Meet me halfway.

359
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,670
l'll give it a shot.

360
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:23,029
I knew it. I knew it!
That girl the other night mailed me this.

361
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,519
'Dear Mr Quick, I couldn't help but
acknowledge our mutual attraction.'

362
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,679
'Perhaps we should have dinner
and talk. Please respond, EV2-0304.'

363
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,996
'Truly, Miss Dominique La Rue.'

364
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,590
See, that girl had nothing to do
with that cop.

365
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,590
She made Smalls bring her here
so she could meet me.

366
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,031
- I said not to mess with her.
- She came after me.

367
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,552
We don't know if she's still
with Calhoune. I can find out.

368
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,469
- Where did she get that French name?
- She's Creole.

369
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,195
Don't mess with Creole women.
They can put a root on your ass.

370
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,159
- What's a root?
- lt's a voodoo curse Creole girls do.

371
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,518
- Get out of here.
- No, he's not lying. He's serious.

372
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,599
- What's his name who had that curse?
- Wallace Wallcott.

373
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,874
He was messing around with a Creole
girl, and she put voodoo on him.

374
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,675
His dick shrunk
to the size of a cocktail weenie.

375
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,756
No, that's bullshit.

376
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,597
You got to get out of the jungle
with that witchcraft jazz.

377
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,233
I don't like it.

378
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,434
I just want to know if she's still with
Calhoune. Witchcraft is your thing.

379
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,315
They bury your drawers in the yard
so you can't go out.

380
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,953
Yeah!

381
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,712
Your drawers in the yard?

382
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,113
Hey, Sugar.
What was the number today?

383
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,117
3-0-4.

384
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,756
That's the third time
they slapped my number.

385
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,476
Somebody better take care of it.
You'll take care of my money.

386
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,032
- What's wrong with him?
- He lost a number.

387
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,151
So is she still with him?

388
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:35,036
I don't know. She wouldn't talk on
the phone. We're doing good tonight.

389
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,435
We're doing great. Look.

390
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,879
Damn...!
Until a couple of seconds ago.

391
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,078
- Who's that?
- The cop who came by my house.

392
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,631
Hey, Ray. The candy man.

393
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:13,915
Hello, Sergeant Cantone.
l'd like you to meet a friend, Mr Quick.

394
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:19,194
- Quick like in 'fast'?
- Quick like in 'quick to whip ass'.

395
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,109
You mean like 'you might
get your ass whipped quick'?

396
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,871
I haven't had my ass whipped in a while.
Probably been like 1911 .

397
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:33,598
- When the doctor slapped your ass.
- That's the last time. l'm looking for him.

398
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,839
Well, stick around.
l'm kind of mad at you, Ray.

399
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,919
- Why are you mad at me?
- You lied to me.

400
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:47,353
You said you were in the candy
business. It was you I was looking for.

401
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,393
Are you going to take me in for that?

402
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,637
No, I ain't going to arrest you.

403
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,913
I want to talk business with you.
Where can we talk?

404
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,510
- My office.
- Where's your office?

405
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:12,679
Here's the deal. I got a call from a friend
by the name of Bugsy Calhoune.

406
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,474
He said you were sitting
on a goldmine here.

407
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,274
Now, don't get me wrong...

408
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,233
...there's always
going to be after-hour places.

409
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,829
We generally leave them alone,

410
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,589
but you guys are doing
10,000-15,000 a week.

411
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,030
That's a lot of money.

412
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,916
To be perfectly honest, Mr Calhoune
and myself want some of it.

413
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:39,079
How much money are you talking about,
you maggot motherfucker?

414
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,675
You guys are doing 15,000.
Let's say our cut is 10,000.

415
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,240
You're robbing us, you son of a bitch.

416
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,238
No, no. You're robbing the system, Ray.

417
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,434
What do you want, sympathy from me?
You're criminals, for Christ's sake!

418
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,074
It's a pretty fair deal.

419
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,033
I wanted more.

420
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,518
But Bugsy said it was fair.
He's a real softy, Bugsy.

421
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,396
If it was up to me, l'd give you jigs
just enough money to function.

422
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,390
When I see you guys with the fancy
suits and cars and nice houses,

423
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,512
and l'm living in a fucking hovel!

424
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,154
I mean, that bothers me.

425
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,480
So have we got a deal or what?

426
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,556
Can we get back to you?

427
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,316
No, l'll get back to you.

428
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,794
Ray, would you mind
if I take a box of chocolate hearts?

429
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,313
- lt's my wife's birthday.
- Help yourself. Anyhing you want.

430
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,999
Thanks.

431
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,868
Round everyone up.
Be at my house in an hour.

432
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,471
We can't let him come here
and do this. Don't run from him.

433
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,834
We've got to, but before we do
we're going to kick him in the nuts.

434
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,674
Calhoune can kiss my ass. I won't
give him shit. We ought to relocate.

435
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,350
A lot of you got families
and can't easily relocate.

436
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:55,317
From your complaints, I know you can't
live on a third of what you earn now.

437
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,559
I have a plan
where we can all make heavy money.

438
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,436
If everything works out the way I plan,
you'll have $50,000 each.

439
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,915
With that, you can relocate.

440
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,476
Go legit if you want to,
open your own business.

441
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,319
How are we going
to make $50,000 each?

442
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,035
Everybody knows
the big fight is this week.

443
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:24,189
There will be 3/4 of a million dollars
in the booking houses by Friday.

444
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,119
Calhoune's going to make
a lot of money.

445
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,039
He owns all the booking houses
except ours.

446
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,800
How do we make $50,000?

447
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,036
We'll rob Bugsy Calhoune.

448
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,595
We can't stand up to him,
so how can we rob him?

449
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,519
If everything goes the way I plan,

450
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,678
we'll be gone
before he realises he's been hit.

451
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,635
We've got to get cash
and put it on that white boy to win.

452
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,957
- Jenkins will kill that boy.
- Exactly.

453
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,358
Calhoune knows we know Jenkins so
if he sees us betting on the white boy,

454
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,838
he'll think we talked Jenkins into taking
a dive to make money to relocate.

455
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,918
He puts his money
with the other money,

456
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,908
so it doesn't matter who wins,
we're hitting all the money.

457
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,156
You're a smart motherfucker.

458
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,351
- Are you guys with me?
- Yeah!

459
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,629
We'll see you all tomorrow, then.

460
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,233
Quick, I want to talk to you.

461
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,752
You might want to talk
to Tommy Smalls tomorrow.

462
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,714
- For what?
- He can't be that big a 'Tom'.

463
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,276
You loosen him up, maybe he'll tell you
something about Cantone.

464
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,273
- You think Smalls is that stupid?
- I know he's that stupid.

465
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,995
Sergeant Phil Cantone.
Are you with this gentleman?

466
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,670
- No, l'm not.
- lt's nice to meet you.

467
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,117
Come on, Tommy.

468
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,594
Come on!

469
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,949
- What is going on here?
- Are you awake now?

470
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,436
Hell, yeah, l'm awake.
What is going on here?

471
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,835
- All right?
- l'm all right and l'm awake.

472
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,033
What's going on? Why did you
punch me? I should jack you up.

473
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,392
- lt's time to pay the piper, Tommy.
- What are you talking about?

474
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,434
- That five grand you lifted.
- Five who that lifted what?

475
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,792
Wait.
I don't know what you're talking about.

476
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,629
If there's a problem,
we can talk to Calhoune.

477
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:46,551
I spoke to Mr Calhoune. He wanted me
to say he's mad at you for stealing.

478
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,399
But I ain't stole shit!

479
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,149
And there is one other thing.

480
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,356
Bugsy said I was to cut his throat.

481
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,713
Then cut it.

482
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,952
It's done. Our friend's a memory.

483
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,955
But you know,
the strangest thing just happened.

484
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,239
What's that?

485
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:47,833
One of Sugar Ray's people
just put a $200,000 bet on the fight.

486
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,636
That's nothing. They're just trying to
make some cash before closing down.

487
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,755
Don't worry. Everybody knows that jig
is going to kill Kirkpatrick.

488
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,552
Yes, I know.

489
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,472
But they're not betting on Jenkins.

490
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,319
They're putting their money
on Kirkpatrick.

491
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,435
At 3-1 they are going to make
six hundred grand if he wins.

492
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,315
Those sneaky bastards.
They put the fix on.

493
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,309
Jenkins is going to throw the fight.

494
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,476
It makes sense.

495
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,637
Jesus. Ain't that champ a wonderful
fucking human being?

496
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,190
So what do you do now?

497
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,431
Why should they be the only ones to
benefit from Mr Jenkins's generosity?

498
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,871
l'm going to put 500,000
on Kirkpatrick to win.

499
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,230
Pick up a little extra cash.

500
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,309
You should scrape together whatever
you can and do the same thing.

501
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,830
- Is Smalls up there?
- Sometimes the buzzers don't work.

502
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,719
My name is Quick. l'm an old friend.
Do you think I could knock on the door?

503
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,912
Smalls?

504
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,437
Tommy, your door is open. It's Quick.

505
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,636
Hey, your door is open. It's Quick.

506
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,356
Smalls!

507
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,311
Hey, Smalls.

508
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,476
Tommy?

509
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,636
Tommy...?

510
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,431
Hey, man, are you asleep?

511
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:20,510
Holy shit!
Somebody fucked you up real bad.

512
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,635
I think l'm going to leave because
you probably want to sit by yourself

513
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:30,197
and think about who you pissed off,
so l'll let you have your space.

514
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,879
Excuse me.

515
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,309
- Isn't that Quick?
- Yes, that's him.

516
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,353
What's he doing coming out
of my brother's house?

517
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,230
Let's find out.

518
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,549
Miss La Rue, your guest has arrived.

519
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,512
Hello, Mr Quick.

520
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:33,555
Meet Mr Bugsy Calhoune
and his assistant, Joseph Leoni.

521
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,439
Have a seat.

522
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,479
- Are those flowers and candy for me?
- No, I brought them for the lady.

523
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,559
Give them to her.
She loves flowers and candy.

524
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,909
So, how's business, Mr Quick?

525
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,390
- Excuse me?
- Business over at Sugar Ray's.

526
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,431
Business is all right.

527
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,437
All right?
I hear you guys are going great.

528
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,519
Dominique says your place was packed
Monday night. Nobody is busy then.

529
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,315
Your place was packed on a Monday.
You must be doing great.

530
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,432
What do you move, 15-20,000 a week?

531
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,790
I don't know about all that shit.
I don't do the books.

532
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,278
You don't see the books?
That would be pretty stupid.

533
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,632
- Well, I trust my partner, Ray.
- Never trust anybody.

534
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,912
Everybody in this business
is a criminal.

535
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,516
This is too deep for me.
I think l'm going to go home.

536
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,679
Wait a second. What's your rush?
Here, have some wine.

537
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,388
By the way, Mr Quick,

538
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,639
did a Sergeant Phil Cantone
come by the other day?

539
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,592
He came by.

540
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,439
He told you about
my business proposition?

541
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,349
He told us about your offer. I wouldn't
call that a business proposition.

542
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:09,509
It was business, Quick. I don't make
offers. I make business propositions.

543
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,473
l've got a very good one for you.

544
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,798
I want you to work for me
at the Pitty Pat Club.

545
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,231
I want you to run it with Dominique.

546
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,559
- I don't think so.
- Lots of money for you.

547
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,390
After Sugar Ray starts paying us off,
your cut won't be what it used to be.

548
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,673
I could really use you there.
You could turn it into a hot spot.

549
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,553
You understand your people.

550
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,069
Mr Quick.

551
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,953
It would be an advantage to all of us,

552
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,879
if you'd join
Mr Calhoune's organisation.

553
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,437
You guys are incredible. I can't believe
you called me down here and...

554
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,598
This is very nice,
but no thanks. l'm sorry.

555
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,430
There's no reason for you to get upset.
I just want you to think it over.

556
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:08,350
- There's nothing to think about.
- Joe, show Mr Quick to his car.

557
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:13,475
Joe, you don't have to show Mr Quick
no place. I can find my way out.

558
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,114
Thank you, but no thanks.

559
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,750
- What do you think of Mr Quick?
- What do you mean?

560
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,717
Do you like him? Do you think he is
someone you might want to fuck?

561
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,398
- Yes.
- Good.

562
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,232
Good.

563
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:00,038
Let's kill that bastard now, man.
Let's do it for Tommy!

564
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,956
What is this shit about?

565
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:36,194
- He killed my brother.
- lt's all right, we'll get him.

566
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,551
He messed with
the wrong nigger's brother.

567
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,112
Quick is mine.

568
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,909
Pull up to his bumper,
we'll blow his head off.

569
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,432
Damn, I think I broke my nose!

570
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,592
Junior, are you OK? Junior?

571
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:34,555
Junior is deader than a motherfucker.
You shot him in the back of the head!

572
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,594
It was a mistake.
Pull up next to that motherfucker.

573
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,712
Shut up, it was a mistake!

574
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,675
It was an accident, Junior.
l'm sorry. l'm sorry, Junior.

575
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,633
Get that motherfucker now!

576
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,149
l'm sorry, Junior.

577
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:18,356
Shut the fuck up!
You're always crying, motherfucker.

578
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,790
Catch him. Come on. Come on!

579
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,069
You are a dead motherfucker.
l'm going to get you.

580
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,477
l'm going to get you.
l'm going to get you, motherfucker!

581
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,593
Fuck!

582
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,476
Stop the car! Stop the fucking car!

583
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,274
Shit! Sneaky motherfucker.
Let's get him.

584
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,389
l'm going to kill you, Quick!

585
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,237
You made me shoot one of my boys
in the back of the head.

586
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,679
And you did something to my brother.

587
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,519
I don't know what you're talking about.

588
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,077
That's bullshit, man.
You know what l'm talking about.

589
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,630
You broke my nose, man.

590
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,437
l'll say this one more time.
I don't know what you're talking about.

591
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,349
And I suggest
you let me go on my way.

592
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,118
Oh, really?

593
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,319
I suggest you kiss my ass, Quick.

594
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,676
The only way you are going home
is shot, motherfucker.

595
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,309
What do you think you're doing
with that little shit?

596
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:25,951
Stop it. Stop it. Don't shoot
that little motherfucker no more!

597
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,879
Fuck this.

598
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,951
Asshole.

599
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,550
- Quick's pulled up in a cab.
- What's he doing in a cab?

600
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,637
- You in a cab? That ain't your style.
- I had a little fender bender.

601
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,913
- Are you all right?
- I need a second to collect myself.

602
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,112
What did you learn about
Calhoune's girlfriend?

603
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:29,236
I don't know what I just found out.
How are we going with everything else?

604
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,879
Sugar... Right.

605
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,559
Thanks, man. l'll get back to you.

606
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:44,878
The same gentleman is doing
the pick-up this year, Mr Richie Vento.

607
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,709
Vera, I want you
to put somebody on him.

608
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,593
- All right.
- You got a girl who can turn him out?

609
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:56,954
I have got a girl
whose pussy is so good,

610
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:01,199
if you threw it up in the air,
it would turn into sunshine.

611
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,270
- I don't want to meet her.
- I do.

612
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,917
Put her on him.

613
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,236
Yeah. Who is it?

614
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,277
Just a moment.

615
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,436
Dominique La Rue.

616
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,031
That voodoo bitch.

617
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,435
Hello?

618
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:30,518
I can meet with you.
Just you, right?

619
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,439
Give me a half hour. Yeah.

620
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,353
Do come in, Mr Quick.

621
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:02,917
Very nice. Very impressive.
Very impressive.

622
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,392
- Is your real name Quick?
- Excuse me?

623
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,989
Is Quick your real name?

624
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,079
No, my name is not Quick.
My real name is...

625
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,831
No one's asked me that. My real name
is...don't laugh...is Vernest.

626
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,350
I see you are laughing.
My name is Vernest Brown.

627
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:28,031
I use Quick because
Vernest Brown is a fucked up name.

628
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,710
l'd like to change the subject.
Can I have a seat?

629
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,117
This is a very beautiful house.

630
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,996
It doesn't belong to me. It belongs to
Mr Calhoune. I stay here sometimes.

631
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:46,113
- lt's true what they say about you two?
- And what is that?

632
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,312
You know, they say that...

633
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,398
They say that you give Calhoune...

634
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,515
...stuff.

635
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:01,153
- I work for Mr Calhoune.
- What kind of work do you do?

636
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,430
Whatever's required.

637
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:09,192
And your interest in me,
is that business or is it personal?

638
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,674
Both.

639
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,752
l'd like to go upstairs. Are you coming?

640
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,957
That's cute.

641
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:55,678
I thought I was the only person
who slept with his guns under the pillow.

642
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:00,874
That is so adorable. We have
so much in common. This is so cute.

643
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,111
It's cute.

644
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,954
What are you doing in there?

645
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,554
Come here.

646
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,429
You are unbelievable.

647
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:02,669
So were you, Vernest Brown.

648
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,151
Only you can make
'Vernest Brown' sound good.

649
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,676
You are the only person
who can get away with it.

650
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:22,594
I got a question. You know
what we were just doing, was that...

651
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,030
Was that work?

652
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,552
I know work was being done.
I was doing serious work.

653
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:35,595
I was working. But was that work
for you, or was that personal?

654
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,913
Both.

655
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:46,312
It was personal for me
and business for Mr Calhoune.

656
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,470
Is he here? I thought I felt
another hand on my ass a while ago.

657
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:59,516
I thought you were going crazy,
but he's under the bed grabbing asses.

658
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,952
- No, he's not here.
- Well, where is he?

659
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:09,391
Don't worry. He isn't coming here.
He's with his wife.

660
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,836
Bugsy is married?
The man is married to...

661
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:17,715
l've been trying to figure this out
since I first saw you.

662
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,673
Why would a woman like you
be interested

663
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:26,034
in a big, fat, greasy, bloated, stinking,
gelatin-ass motherfucker?

664
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:30,836
What's the attraction to this man?
Plus he's married, too.

665
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:35,352
He's a very brilliant man
and he's taught me a lot.

666
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,351
A lot about what?

667
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,596
Like about the business.

668
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,551
What about the business?

669
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,759
That you can't trust anybody.

670
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,520
Everybody in the business...

671
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,591
...is a criminal.

672
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,393
And how can you ever trust a criminal?

673
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:17,280
So that's what this is about.
You're supposed to kill me?

674
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,799
Yes.

675
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:25,160
And you would make love to me first,
then shoot me?

676
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,949
l'm sorry, Vernest.

677
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,470
It's only business.

678
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,233
This is personal.

679
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:46,950
What's the matter with you?
You look at all the other guys but me.

680
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:51,278
- I ain't looking at every guy.
- Pay attention to me. l'm your date.

681
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,871
You ain't got enough of anyhing
for me to mess with.

682
01:05:56,080 --> 01:06:00,756
You heard me.
l'm going to get myself a real man.

683
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,077
l've got enough sense
to get away from you.

684
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,635
Buy your own drinks from now on.

685
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:13,757
That girl's been staring at you, Richie.
She wants something.

686
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:19,557
- Why did she get rid of that guy?
- She wants us. The three of us, Richie.

687
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,911
She looks too classy for that.
She's beautiful.

688
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:27,159
I don't usually look at coloured women,
but she's gorgeous.

689
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,990
Richie, she is smiling at you.

690
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:37,474
Richie, the lady would like
to buy you a drink.

691
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,911
I told you she was hot.
She wants to fuck.

692
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:45,796
- Is she going to buy us a drink, too?
- Sorry, she only said this gentleman.

693
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,553
Richie, you lucky bastard.

694
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:55,676
Listen, tell the lady l'll accept her offer
if she'll come sit with me.

695
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,154
You got it.

696
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:28,113
- You're in, Richie. You're in.
- l'll tell you when l'm in. l'll call you.

697
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:31,198
Get out of here, both of you.

698
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,155
Did you notice me watching you?

699
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:46,353
- I can't say I did.
- Well, I was.

700
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,994
l'm new in town
and I haven't any friends.

701
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:53,193
You look quite friendly.
Would you like to be my friend?

702
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,357
Well, look...

703
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:05,030
Sure, l'd like to be my friend.
I mean, be your friend.

704
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:08,437
My name is Richie, Richie Vento.

705
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,678
And what's your name, darling dear?

706
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,278
Sunshine.

707
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,108
Yes, goddammit. l'm coming.

708
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,278
l'm coming.

709
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,676
Just a minute.

710
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,992
- How was it?
- I killed her.

711
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:47,034
- Tore the pussy up?
- No, man, I killed her.

712
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,389
What are you talking about?

713
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:58,476
- I shot her, man.
- Was the pussy that bad?

714
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,752
She tried to kill me.
That's why she wanted to see me.

715
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:05,919
Calhoune tried to use her
to take me out. He tried twice tonight.

716
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:10,159
- What else happened?
- Smalls' people think I fingered Smalls.

717
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,828
They tried to kill me after that dinner,

718
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,350
which was really an invitation
to join Calhoune's gang.

719
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,199
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

720
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:24,520
I was figuring all this out. He ain't getting
a third chance, l'm after him now.

721
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:28,269
Be cool. Don't be stupid, now.
Let's figure out what to do.

722
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,836
I ain't no punk.
You try to kill me, I kill you.

723
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,110
All right. Sit down.

724
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:37,278
- Why should I sit down?
- Sit down, man.

725
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,473
It's not about being a punk, OK?

726
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:47,189
Quick, you're not a gangster.

727
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:51,075
We're not. We're club owners.
We run a dancehall.

728
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:56,035
Calhoune is a cold-hearted killer.
He'll have your ass killed.

729
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,988
The man probably
doesn't know about La Rue yet.

730
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:04,510
But in the morning
he's going to want you dead,

731
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:08,554
so we're going to find a place
where we can lay low

732
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:12,116
until we can run this scam and split.

733
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,756
- Are you saying I should hide?
- You're going to hide.

734
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,155
If you don't, they'll kill you.

735
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:23,309
I didn't come this far so you could prove
you ain't no punk and die.

736
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,592
What about your tombstone?
'Here lies a man, 27 years old.'

737
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,995
'He died, but he ain't no punk.'

738
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:33,509
That's bullshit, OK?
When you die at 89,

739
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:37,235
with your children and grandchildren
around the bed, that's cool.

740
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:43,197
It ain't cool to die at 27. I won't let you
do that. I won't let you do it to me.

741
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:48,315
If they kill you, they'll have to kill me
because l'm going to kill them.

742
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:07,434
All right, everybody.
This is a fucking raid.

743
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:11,030
Anybody try to leave,
l'll pump one in your ass.

744
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,073
Everybody's under arrest.

745
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:20,116
Cooperate with the officers so we can
get this done as quickly as possible.

746
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:25,433
Band! Play some travelling music.

747
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,871
Everybody's going downtown
on the A train.

748
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,911
Motherfucker.

749
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,670
Jack Jenkins!

750
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:45,076
Jack Jenkins, the Heavyweight
Champion of the World!

751
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,590
I can't believe it.
What are you doing here?

752
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,270
You're the Heavyweight Champion
of the World. My kids love you.

753
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:56,109
Everybody I know loves you.
What are you doing here?

754
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,998
You should be in training.
Will you be ready for the fight?

755
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,314
l'll be fine.

756
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,394
You'll be fine.

757
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:16,353
Sugar, let's talk in the office.
Can Jack come?

758
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,030
Come on, Jack. Come on.
The heavyweight champ.

759
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,998
Can I have your autograph?

760
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,914
I don't...

761
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,117
...sign autographs.

762
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,073
Sure you do, Jack.

763
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:40,113
Or you'll go downtown
with the rest of the jigs,

764
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,550
and you'll miss your fight.

765
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:50,430
- Who do I make this out to?
- 'To my good friend Phil.'

766
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,588
Ray, I won't take you down tonight,

767
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,429
because I want you to find out
where your friend Quick is.

768
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,359
But your place is closed down.

769
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,074
Jack, Phil starts with a 'P', not an 'F'.

770
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:19,473
What difference does it make?
As long as you keep knocking them out.

771
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:25,192
He's a good kid.
If you hear anyhing, let me know, OK?

772
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,200
Punk m-mo...

773
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:35,753
I know.

774
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,950
You need a...

775
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:54,032
No, I think l've got one of those tonight.

776
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:02,109
Why don't you go home and get some
sleep, Champ? You need your rest.

777
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:07,033
OK, man.

778
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,997
Taxi!

779
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,556
In you go, Champ.

780
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,355
Take it easy, OK?

781
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,198
Hi, Mr Calhoune. How are you doing?
How's things going?

782
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,191
Get in, Ray.

783
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,118
Where's Quick?

784
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:04,719
Quick has nerve problems.
People have been trying to kill him.

785
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:07,718
So I let him off for a few days to relax.

786
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:13,755
Quick's nerves are bad
from people trying to kill him?

787
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,633
I know of four people
Quick killed last night.

788
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,354
One was a pretty young girl I know.

789
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,960
Would you know anyhing
about that, Ray?

790
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:37,275
Quick? Oh, man.
Where did you hear that?

791
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:42,429
I hear a lot of things, Ray.
A lot of things.

792
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,916
I hear you are ruining my business
with your club.

793
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,078
I hear you don't want to go
into business with me.

794
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,829
You know, I hear all these things, Ray.

795
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,793
And I add them up.
Know what I come up with?

796
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,876
- No.
- You don't?

797
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:07,113
That you're a smart old man who knows
when he's finished and it's time to leave.

798
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:10,073
But there's a young hothead
who thinks he's tough

799
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:15,348
and wants to start some shit instead of
letting things take their natural course.

800
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,994
That's what I come up with.

801
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:24,996
A young dumb fuck who's going
to make it two less jigs in this world.

802
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,078
One old and one young.

803
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:32,717
When you see Quick, I suggest
you guys make plans to go elsewhere,

804
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,593
because l'm tired
of playing around with jigs.

805
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,113
You get me?

806
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,278
Is that all?

807
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,075
- What?
- Is that all?

808
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,073
Yeah, Ray, yeah. I think that's all.

809
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,272
Goodnight.

810
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:18,673
l'd like to have the people
on that list bailed out.

811
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:29,632
There are 125 people on this list.
You're posting bail for 125 people?

812
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,319
Is that a problem?

813
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,157
Just a minute.

814
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:42,239
A guy wants to post bail on everybody
arrested at the after-hours joint.

815
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,113
- Who is he?
- Some fancy coloured guy.

816
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:50,394
He's probably some nut. Tell him how
much it'll cost and he'll run off scared.

817
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,517
OK, let's see.

818
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:04,397
125 people on a class A
misdemeanour will be about...

819
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,316
...$7,500.

820
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,431
$7,500?

821
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:14,872
Yes, $7,500.

822
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,396
Give me a receipt.

823
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,475
l'm sorry about the inconvenience.

824
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,718
Kiss my entire ass.

825
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:43,670
Quick, you should have seen it.
30 limousines driving off into the sunset.

826
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,394
Them white boys
didn't know what to think.

827
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:49,831
We can't reopen
because they'll bust us every night.

828
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:53,715
In every limousine
there was a box of candy,

829
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,515
and every box had a note,
'Sorry for the inconvenience.'

830
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:00,280
You are a cool,
sweet motherfucker, Sugar.

831
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,516
I love to see shit like that.

832
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:06,315
You'd love to see anyhing.
What have you got to eat?

833
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:11,036
l've got some cans of hash in there.
Fix me some hash and eggs.

834
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,708
- You want anyhing?
- l'm OK.

835
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,071
Get your little narrow ass
off the arm of that sofa.

836
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,999
So, everybody's looking for me?

837
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:23,988
Yes. We'll be out of here soon.
We do our thing and then we step.

838
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,395
How's Sunshine doing?

839
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,989
He proposed to her four times already,

840
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,510
said he'd leave his wife
and convert from Catholic to Baptist.

841
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:35,837
That's some mean pussy
to make a man change gods.

842
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,913
- Where's the hash?
- Middle cabinet on the third shelf.

843
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:47,238
- That's not hash, it's tuna fish.
- Make some tuna, then.

844
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,749
You've got to do something
about them eyes.

845
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:54,829
l'm ready for hash, and you ain't got
no hash. Don't keep fucking with me!

846
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:59,113
- Bitch, please.
- 'Bitch, please,' my ass!

847
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,880
- Do you want a sandwich?
- If it's not too much trouble.

848
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:06,835
Don't get smart with me.
You're the dumbest ass in captivity.

849
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,794
Did you apologise to her
for shooting her in the foot?

850
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,958
Did you ever apologise to her?

851
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,440
I thought that thing was forgotten.

852
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:25,110
She said that,
but I think she still was a little hurt.

853
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:30,474
She still is. She doesn't show it,
but inside she is a sweet old woman.

854
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:35,356
Bennie, why did you put this juice back
with just a swallow left?

855
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:37,118
Leave me alone.

856
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:40,278
It doesn't make sense.
You should just finish it.

857
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,756
Don't put it back
with just a swallow in the container.

858
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:47,316
I get set for orange juice,
and there's just a swallow left.

859
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,398
- Swallow it and shut up.
- Blind motherfucker!

860
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,912
You fat bitch! You should go talk to her
and tell her you're sorry.

861
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,392
Yes, you should.

862
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,876
You want a sandwich, Quick?

863
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,793
No.

864
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,273
l'm OK.

865
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,952
- You OK?
- Yes, I just can't stand a lot of silly shit.

866
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,720
Now, why wouldn't he finish this?

867
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,070
That's just dumb.

868
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,190
Hey, you know, Vera...

869
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:35,077
...I never said 'l'm sorry'
to nobody for nothing I did.

870
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,838
But...

871
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:42,389
...I wish what happened
never happened, and...

872
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,637
...I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

873
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:51,231
And...

874
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,434
...l'm sorry.

875
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:57,517
Take your sorry ass in there

876
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:02,475
and tell Sugar to send somebody
to get some orange juice.

877
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:04,750
I love you, too.

878
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,475
Little old boy.

879
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:15,274
I love that little old boy.

880
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:23,431
l'm falling in love with you.

881
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,596
Oh, Richie.

882
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,270
l'm serious. Nobody's ever
made me feel the way you do.

883
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,394
When can I see you again?

884
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,355
l'll be free after the fight tomorrow.

885
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:46,759
No, tomorrow night's bad.
I got something to do.

886
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,758
All night?

887
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:52,269
Between 8 and 10.

888
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:57,073
Why don't you do what you have to do...

889
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:03,872
...and then after you finish,
you come back and you pick me up?

890
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,789
Wait, I forgot.
l'm finished with my work at 9.30.

891
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,028
That means I have to stand outside
in the cold with all that stuff in my bag.

892
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:16,357
What stuff? What do you do, anyway?

893
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,071
Every month I do a numbers pick-up
at one place,

894
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:28,149
and I drop it off at another
the next day, and I get paid for it.

895
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,191
You're a pick-up girl?

896
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:36,471
- I knew you'd hate me. l'll just leave.
- Don't be ridiculous.

897
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:40,992
Someday l'll tell you what I do,
and we'll both laugh about this.

898
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,434
l'm so glad you're not angry.

899
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:54,549
I shouldn't stand on that corner for half
an hour with all that stuff in my bag.

900
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:56,955
Let's get together another time.

901
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:02,837
Listen, where are you going
to be tomorrow night at 9.30?

902
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,998
My pick-up is on Lenox Avenue.

903
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:11,354
Tomorrow night at 9.30 l'll pick you up
at Lenox and 110th Street.

904
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:16,554
- What about what you had to do?
- l'll pick you up along the way.

905
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:24,877
You make me so happy. You know what
I do when you still want to see me?

906
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:29,232
Richie, you know, I have to admit,

907
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:33,718
when we first met,
I was intimidated by you.

908
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:37,913
- You were?
- And when we made love, I held back.

909
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,712
You did?

910
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:44,152
But now that l've told you
the truth about myself,

911
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:50,390
I want to be completely free to do
any and every thing you want me to.

912
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,158
Oh, God!

913
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:56,357
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- Yes.

914
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,358
- Lenox and 110th?
- Yes.

915
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,876
l'll be there. You bet.

916
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:14,039
Richie...

917
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,515
...I think l'm falling in love with you.

918
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:50,196
Yeah. Give me Hollycourt 55377.

919
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:56,598
Hello, it's Daddy.
Darling, put Mommy on the phone.

920
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:01,749
Barbara, it's Richie. I ain't never
coming home no more. Take it easy.

921
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:14,677
Then the son of a bitch had cars
and chauffeured everybody home.

922
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,911
Anybody see Quick?

923
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:22,989
Nobody has seen him on the street
at all. But he'll show up eventually.

924
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,714
For the time being,
Sugar Ray's is closed.

925
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:29,754
For the time being?
I want it closed permanently.

926
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:21,988
Ladies and gentlemen,
and now for the main event.

927
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:27,228
Fighting out of Ireland,
weighing in at 250 pounds,

928
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,078
the Irish iron man...

929
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,715
...Michael Kirkpatrick!

930
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:39,872
And fighting out of Harlem, New York,

931
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:43,117
weighing in at 220 pounds,

932
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:47,791
wearing maroon trunks
with a gold stripe,

933
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,836
the Heavyweight Champion
of the World, Jack Jenkins.

934
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:05,517
You received your instructions
in the dressing room.

935
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:09,713
I want a nice clean fight.
Shake hands and come out fighting.

936
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:15,231
Don't take this ass-whipping
personally.

937
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,878
JACK JENKINS

938
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,916
There's the bell for round one.

939
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,633
Doesn't look like
he's trying to throw this fight.

940
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,911
Come on, Willie!

941
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,918
Sunshine.

942
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:14,958
- Hello, darling dear.
- Hey, sweet daddy.

943
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:19,472
- That's a lot of numbers, baby.
- I know. Throw them in the trunk.

944
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:32,349
l'll get that door. Here.

945
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,513
- Thanks, Richie.
- You're welcome, baby.

946
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:51,755
- I really missed you, sweet daddy.
- Me, too, sweet mommy.

947
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,518
I got a big surprise...

948
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,793
Are you blind?

949
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,994
Jesus, the cops are coming.

950
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:08,270
Take it easy, just relax.

951
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,391
Not tonight, fuck me.

952
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,833
- You are in trouble.
- That light was green.

953
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:29,591
No, sir, it was red.
But that's the least of your problems.

954
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:33,349
- Do you know who you got in the car?
- Who?

955
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:36,313
Lady Heroin.
We've been tracking her all night.

956
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:40,308
- She put 40lbs of smack in your trunk.
- Heroin?

957
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,915
Step out of the car, please, sir.

958
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,555
- I don't know nothing about this.
- You, too, Miss Heroin.

959
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:55,190
So, Lady Heroin,
we finally caught you, right?

960
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:58,756
Got your boy, too. You are both
going to jail for a long time.

961
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:02,589
Wait a minute, I ain't no boy.
I just met her this week.

962
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,553
- l'm sorry, Richie.
- Don't sorry me.

963
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,593
- l'm sorry, baby.
- Don't 'baby' me.

964
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:11,872
l'm in trouble here.
l'm dying in the street.

965
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:15,277
You should have told me
your last name was Heroin.

966
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:18,074
That doesn't mean you have to sell it.

967
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:32,275
- What do we have here, officers?
- Lady Heroin and her boyfriend.

968
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:35,472
- This guy?
- Can I speak to you privately?

969
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:37,033
You want to confess?

970
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:40,915
Officers, this is our collar
and we'll handle it.

971
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:45,238
Relax, boy. You're out of your territory,
so just cool it. Come here.

972
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,719
Talk to me.

973
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,354
- You know Phil Cantone?
- We work for him.

974
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:56,917
Tell these jigs to get out of here.
l'm doing a run for Bugsy.

975
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,793
- Why didn't you say?
- I just did.

976
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,276
Take this girl and let this guy
go about his business.

977
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:10,234
First of all, this guy is an accessory,
and what we're going to do...

978
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:15,912
You're going to do nothing. We'll take it
from here. Thank you, officers.

979
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:18,839
All right, take her.

980
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:23,556
- Thanks for the help.
- Get out of here and stay out of trouble.

981
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:30,275
Jenkins drives him against the ropes.
He's got him pinned against the ropes.

982
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:31,873
He's hitting him hard.

983
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:45,878
What?

984
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,354
Fuck!

985
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,230
How are you doing, boys?

986
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,116
It's real good to see you.

987
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:11,595
Maybe you can clear something up.

988
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:18,318
I mean, I thought you might pull
something so I followed Vento tonight.

989
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:23,469
And l've got to tell you, the whole thing
was going pretty cute...

990
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:30,549
...until some real boys showed up.
They spoiled it for you guys.

991
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:34,196
You did the right thing
to let them go and not start any shit.

992
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:39,913
But the one thing I can't figure out

993
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:45,240
is why you would break into a bank
that's been closed for five years.

994
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,834
Why would you do that?

995
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,634
- May I?
- Please do.

996
01:36:56,520 --> 01:37:00,877
We figured with Vento doing
a pick-up as big as this,

997
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:04,789
that Bugsy would have his number-one
boy tailing him. That's you.

998
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:12,039
And the cops that pulled us over,
you win some and you lose some.

999
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:16,518
As far as us breaking into a bank
that's been closed for five years,

1000
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:21,271
we're not making a withdrawal...
we're making a deposit.

1001
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,713
A deposit? No bullshit?

1002
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,675
What's that supposed to mean?

1003
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:35,474
It means put down your gun.

1004
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,598
We'll tell the police on Monday
you are here.

1005
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:52,837
Ray, these things
don't have much air in them.

1006
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:57,875
Jimmy estimates there are
a couple of days of air in here.

1007
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:02,835
Who is Jimmy? Is he a scientist?
He measures the fucking air?

1008
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,198
- Jimmy, was that the right calculation?
- Give or take a couple of hours.

1009
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:12,716
There you go.
Give or take an hour or two.

1010
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:16,797
I might see you again.

1011
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:20,838
- Yeah, you might.
- I might.

1012
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:23,872
Goodnight.

1013
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,830
Take very short breaths.

1014
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,516
Maybe, if you breathe like this...

1015
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:35,393
But if you go...
you're a dead motherfucker.

1016
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,675
Is he crazy?

1017
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:16,198
l'll put an end
to this Sugar Ray shit tonight.

1018
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:19,995
- What's with all the sad faces?
- Give me my money and get out.

1019
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:33,711
What's this?

1020
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:39,631
- Where's my money?
- They took the wrong bag.

1021
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:44,595
- Who took the wrong bag?
- I had an accident and the cops came.

1022
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:49,794
- Why would the cops take my money?
- They thought it was heroin.

1023
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,399
Heroin?

1024
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:55,478
Richie, why would they think
it was heroin?

1025
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:58,240
What the fuck are you talking about?

1026
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:02,755
I had Lady Heroin in the car with me.
I was falling in love with her.

1027
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:07,476
I thought I was. She put heroin
in the trunk with the money.

1028
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:11,958
Then I was going through
this green light that was red, and...

1029
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,151
Mr Calhoune, l'm sorry.

1030
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:17,033
You're sorry?
What are you, fucking retarded?

1031
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:21,756
No, it's OK. The cops who took
the money were Cantone's guys.

1032
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:23,473
How do you know?

1033
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:27,753
There were four cops. The first two
were jigs. Then came Cantone's guys.

1034
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:29,996
Get Cantone on the phone.

1035
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:34,796
Why would they take your money
and leave the dope?

1036
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,595
They made a mistake
and took the wrong bag.

1037
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:45,434
You gave a million dollars of my money
to the cops for a bag of heroin?

1038
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,233
What are you, a fucking moron?

1039
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,114
Yes.

1040
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:09,109
This isn't heroin. It's sugar.

1041
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:15,915
That son of a bitch.
That goddamn son of a bitch.

1042
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:18,714
There's no answer, boss. He's not in.

1043
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:21,878
It's a woman named Vera.
Says she works for Ray.

1044
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:28,110
Clean up that mess. Let her in.

1045
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:43,679
l'm sorry, Mr Calhoune.
But I didn't have nothing to do with it.

1046
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:46,792
Won't you have a seat?

1047
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,515
I wanted to warn you,
but Sugar would have killed me.

1048
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:54,234
His son already shot off
my pinkie toe.

1049
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:58,399
No, is that right?
l'm sorry to hear that, Miss...

1050
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:00,352
Walker. Vera Walker.

1051
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,632
Mick, get Miss Walker
something to drink.

1052
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:08,356
I had nothing to do with it, Mr Calhoune.
l'm no thief.

1053
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:11,597
l'm an honest whore,
and all my whores are honest.

1054
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:16,191
We didn't want to have nothing to do
with this, but they made us keep quiet.

1055
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:20,473
I wanted to tell you, Mr Calhoune,
but I knew they'd have killed me.

1056
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:24,036
Maybe you could help us locate
Mr Ray and Mr Quick.

1057
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:29,953
They are over at Ray's.
But please, don't tell them I told you.

1058
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:33,038
I still have nine toes
and I want to keep them.

1059
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:36,755
I just want to go about my business
with nobody after me.

1060
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:41,954
l'm an old woman, Mr Calhoune,
and I can't stand this fighting no more.

1061
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:46,116
Tony, would you give Miss Walker
my phone number?

1062
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:49,232
If you have any problems, just call me.

1063
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:52,352
Thank you so much, Mr Calhoune.

1064
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:56,115
And thank you, too, sir.

1065
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:59,357
- Goodnight to you all.
- Please see Miss Walker out.

1066
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:09,872
Get the car.

1067
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:16,789
We're going to pay
Mr Ray and Mr Quick a visit.

1068
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:07,031
Hey, boss...

1069
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:11,915
It's Cantone's badge.

1070
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:17,070
Let me see that.

1071
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:26,358
What the hell is going on here? Phil?

1072
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:33,310
Nobody touch anyhing.

1073
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:37,319
I got to figure this out.

1074
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:39,954
I got to figure out the right move.

1075
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:50,958
It's a set-up. It's a fucking set-up.

1076
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,355
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1077
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:10,231
Let's get moving before somebody
comes looking for us.

1078
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:27,639
I want to thank you gentlemen
very much. We appreciate it.

1079
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:31,469
- Don't spend it all in one place.
- Take care, guys. Thanks.

1080
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:38,878
l'm sure going to miss that place.
You know we can never go back.

1081
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:43,710
There are other cities. We'll find
someplace else and start again.

1082
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:46,070
There's no place like Harlem.

1083
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:49,670
You ain't lying, Sugar.
Let me look at it one last time.

1084
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:53,759
Don't waste your time.
Put your blind ass in the car.

1085
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:57,714
l'm going to kick your ass
if you keep talking to me like that.

1086
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:04,477
- Where do you want to go, Pop?
- I don't know, son.

1087
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:08,116
We've got a tank full of gas
and a trunk full of money.

1088
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:14,636
- That sounds like a sweet combination.
- Sweet as sugar.

1089
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52,554
