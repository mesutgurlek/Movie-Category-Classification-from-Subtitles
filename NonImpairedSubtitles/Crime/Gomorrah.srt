1
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,391
How long you gonna be?.

2
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,469
Be right out,

3
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,476
you're a pain!

4
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,395
Hey, American.

5
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,436
I'm still here, gettin' a manicure.

6
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,478
Things okay?.

7
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,436
Gettin' tanned?. Don't get burned!

8
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,317
Bruno's here too.

9
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,391
You got a crap body!

10
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,511
Is Bruno here?.

11
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,429
He's over there.

12
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,431
You doin' a lamp?.

13
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,395
It's 2,000.

14
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,358
How much are you
supposed to get this week?.

15
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,509
9,200.

16
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,318
Sure?. It was less last week.

17
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,356
Yes, Don Ciro 9,200.

18
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,356
Another 2,000 euro and we're even.

19
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,316
Don Ciro, don't take all day.

20
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,277
He's slow.

21
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,396
Hurry, so we can go home.

22
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,316
Things okay out there?.

23
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,515
Keep your eyes open.

24
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,469
That's it.

25
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,436
Put paper cups in.

26
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,514
Toilet paper.

27
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,278
- Then, Mom?.
- Some shampoo.

28
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,475
A mozzarella...

29
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,356
Shampoo, not bath oil!

30
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,313
You're rushin' me!

31
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,391
And you're drivin' me crazy!

32
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,278
Hurry up, there are
more groceries to deliver.

33
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,316
- Nothing else?.
- No.

34
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,438
- Be back later.
- Don't get yourself lost.

35
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,516
- Simone.
- Toto, what's up?.

36
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,318
- What's happening?.
- I'm workin'.

37
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,472
Know what happened?.
They arrested Vitale and Bon Bon.

38
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,349
Really?.

39
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,432
- Got somethin' to eat?.
- Yeah, but it's not mine.

40
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,397
Bye, see you.

41
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,357
Carmela, ma'am!

42
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,515
Hi, Boxer.

43
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,351
Two doses, two doses!

44
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,356
Please, give me a dose!

45
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,311
Gaetano, check it!

46
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,276
One, two, three...

47
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,475
Goodbye.

48
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,476
Don Ciro, be more punctual.

49
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,311
I'll pass it on.

50
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,389
Eleven and twelve.

51
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,311
See if he wants coffee.

52
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,391
No, but thank you anyway....

53
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,357
I'll show you out.

54
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,311
Have a good day.

55
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,317
Four hundred...

56
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,509
Five hundred.

57
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,390
The same amount again?.

58
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,398
I've said a hundred times
I can't manage like this.

59
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,389
Don Carlo...

60
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,274
Did you tell them I can't manage
on this chickenfeed?.

61
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,313
I have to pay rent, lights, water.

62
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,272
I can't survive,
I'm strapped with debts.

63
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,392
- I'll pass it on.
- You always say that!

64
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,273
Are you mockin' me?.

65
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,475
I don't get it!

66
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,474
Listen,

67
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,356
I've got a son to support,

68
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,398
for forty years
I've kept him off the streets,

69
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,356
he's unemployed.

70
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,432
What can I do,
go over to the other side?.

71
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,319
They know, I served you honestly
for forty years.

72
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,437
My wife's in jail,
is this the thanks we get?.

73
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,272
Are we crazy?.
Do I have to raise hell?.

74
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,435
Silvana!

75
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,277
May I?.

76
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,509
Come on in!

77
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,349
Maria!

78
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,277
The bill?.

79
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,430
Talk to Mom.

80
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,351
Put this in your pocket.

81
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,317
Thank you.

82
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,356
Carabinieri on the street!

83
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,436
He's comin' out!

84
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,278
I'm the best, number one!

85
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,475
So?.

86
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,395
Go, Marco!

87
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,473
- I'll blast these roaches!
- Who do you think you're fighting?.

88
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,272
I'm number one! Tony Montana!

89
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,391
The world is ours!

90
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,353
You don't know
who you're up against!

91
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,391
I'm Tony Montana!

92
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,318
- I'm the powerhouse!
- Yeah!

93
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,435
Come here.

94
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,311
Shit Colombians,

95
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,311
they're everywhere.

96
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,278
See, Colombians everywhere.

97
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,273
You really looked like Scarface.

98
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,311
You were good.

99
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,516
Now it all has to be ours,
the whole world.

100
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,357
Miami, all of it.

101
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,430
My friend, got stuff?.

102
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,514
You got stuff?.

103
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,392
- Got good stuff?.
- You got money?.

104
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,314
- Sure, you got coke?.
- What do you want to pay?.

105
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,436
Me?. 50.

106
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,471
- 55, can you do it?.
- No, 55 is too much, 50.

107
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,476
You sure?.

108
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,311
Wait here for me.

109
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,509
Where's Smarty?.

110
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,429
Hey, kid!

111
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,271
Give him the money.

112
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,353
- Is it all here?.
- Yeah.

113
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,273
- Okay?.
- Yes.

114
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,392
- Want to see it?.
- I want to try it.

115
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,514
I gave you the money!

116
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,429
Wait!

117
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,431
Open your hand.

118
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,355
It's good.

119
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,514
Give me all of it!

120
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,277
Grab the money!

121
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,356
Giovanni, I brought the kids.

122
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,475
Come in.

123
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,475
You know very well why you're here.

124
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,471
Too much ruckus going on in my area,
because I'm the boss here.

125
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,514
That's just you sayin'.

126
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,470
If I had you come here, I know.
No back-talk

127
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,436
or I'll smash your face!

128
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,477
- What happened?.
- For the moment, nothing.

129
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,515
Get me?.

130
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,359
I can't be made to look bad
because of two kids like you.

131
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,472
The next time
I hear anything about you,

132
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,474
I'll blow your heads off.

133
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,312
- If it's like you say...
- Shut up when I'm talking.

134
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,436
Then if I come to realize

135
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,436
you're worth something,

136
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,318
which I'll determine and I'll decide,

137
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,278
you can work for me.

138
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,431
Is that clear?.

139
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,311
Show them out.

140
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,316
"I'll smash your face!"

141
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,436
And I'll tear your beard!

142
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,271
Without a T-shirt.

143
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,396
"Sweet Pea", looked like a bum.

144
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,475
A real bum.

145
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,477
He is a bum! Did you see
who he sent to get us?.

146
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,431
If that guy's the boss here,

147
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,476
then here we can be the bosses.

148
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,392
If a guy like him is boss here,
this area is ours!

149
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,316
I'll live for 30 years
if he's boss here.

150
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,313
Sure, because he's a retard!

151
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,393
Get it?. I'll live for 30 years.

152
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,273
But he could at least shave!

153
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,429
Shave!

154
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,356
"I'll smash your face!"

155
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,436
Let's go have a snort to spite him.

156
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,318
We've got everything,
we can do like we want.

157
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,313
Anyway, he's a fat shit-ass.

158
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,357
He bugged you?.

159
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,476
He showers once a week!

160
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,436
"I'll blow your heads off! "

161
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,515
Roberto!

162
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,351
Let's go, it's too small.

163
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,319
- But the methane one's big.
- No, it's small.

164
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,479
- Can I finish measuring?.
- No, we're wasting time.

165
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,359
- I have to take some shots.
- What a bore with these pictures!

166
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,311
Let's go!

167
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,351
Just look at this.

168
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,317
It's disgusting down there.

169
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,429
Here is perfect.

170
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,271
It's perfect.

171
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,512
We're near the highway,
the trucks can get really close,

172
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,278
they dump the earth
and cover all the water.

173
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,475
Perfect.

174
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,511
Franco, it's 85 meters.

175
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,276
Get the length too.

176
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,317
Come here.

177
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,315
Dante.

178
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,396
Hello, everything okay?.

179
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,476
This is Roberto.

180
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,477
- It's time we made room for youth.
- We need new energy.

181
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,476
Take a few more shots.

182
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,356
Did you hear?.

183
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,431
They bombed me,

184
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,397
at the cement plant.

185
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,511
A whole wall came down,

186
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,389
slowly.

187
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,397
Be careful.

188
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,436
Zio resolved it.

189
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,317
I'd forgotten to pay
for some land I'd bought.

190
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,352
- An injunction against payment?.
- Yeah!

191
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,516
- What do you think?.
- It's fine.

192
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,353
- Can we fill this quarry?.
- Sure can.

193
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,396
Tell Zio it's fine.

194
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,439
Remember, everything clean:
terracing, solid stuff...

195
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,432
Or the redevelopment agency
will break our balls.

196
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,471
Don't worry,
you emptied it and I'll fill it.

197
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,433
All the pieces have to be cut
and the sizes worked out.

198
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,391
They want 120 of these.

199
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,431
Six and seven are identical.

200
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,436
Here the satin is cut on the bias.

201
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,431
It's all hand-hemmed.

202
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,397
Is it tough?.

203
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,438
The models aren't hard,
I can do it.

204
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,515
Eight hundred items in two months,
is our request.

205
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,278
Keep in mind
we start at 50 euros per item.

206
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,432
You've seen the models,
the price is good,

207
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,318
estimate and make your offers.

208
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,516
Thirty euro, 30 days?.

209
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,311
Don't go any lower.

210
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,431
This is high fashion,
it's not pret-a-porter.

211
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,436
Forty-five, in two months.

212
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,436
- Ms. Zamarion!
- Yes?.

213
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,511
Thirty-eight, forty.

214
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,356
That's a very interesting proposal.

215
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,351
Thirty-five, thirty-five,

216
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,398
excellent workmanship
and delivery times respected.

217
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,431
Thirty, thirty!

218
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,429
Please,

219
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,273
we're not imposing anything!

220
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,390
Did we say thirty, thirty?.

221
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,391
At this point

222
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,391
twenty-eight, thirty!

223
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,351
Thirty, twenty-five!

224
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,396
I can't lose this bid.

225
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,511
Come here, there's some bubbly!

226
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,311
Are they coming?.

227
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,516
- I don't think so.
- Why not?.

228
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,273
Five days less for delivery,

229
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,272
we'll have to work overtime,
and I'll do nights...

230
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,351
What's odd about that?.

231
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,396
They're talking overtime pay.

232
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,436
They'll get it!

233
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,438
Am I scared of a little overtime?.

234
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,311
Like the last time?.

235
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,430
Don't worry,
this time it's a sure thing.

236
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,398
- They've lost their trust.
- I know.

237
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,393
- I asked you to talk to them.
- You do it, please.

238
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,438
You're on closer terms,
they respect you.

239
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,396
Do me this favor.

240
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,471
Don't say no, go talk to them.

241
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,431
You know I'm fond of you,

242
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,476
I'll have to make
a gold statue to you!

243
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,318
I'll go down and see the accountant
for the money.

244
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,313
Sorry, how much is this?.

245
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,395
Ten thousand.

246
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,396
It's not enough, I need more.

247
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,435
Twice that at least.

248
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,316
Mr. Enzo,
you're already "complicated".

249
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,436
Yes, but for personal affairs.

250
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,318
I need this for work.

251
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,436
I'll give it back in three months.

252
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,318
But this isn't enough.

253
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,470
If you don't need it
and it's not enough,

254
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,475
I'll take it back.

255
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,435
It's best for you.

256
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,350
Don't be like that, listen,

257
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,476
I need at least double!

258
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,277
It's no risk,

259
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,475
you'll earn from it, right?.

260
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,389
What can I say?.

261
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,313
I'll pass it on,
can you make-do for now?.

262
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,396
Yes, I'll take it.

263
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,351
Congratulations, Mr. Pasquale.

264
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,469
Thank you.

265
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,474
We met yesterday.

266
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,430
I need your help.

267
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,476
I am having trouble with work.

268
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,432
I have to get into
haute couture right away,

269
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,356
but for me

270
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,311
it is very difficult.

271
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,396
I need help.

272
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,436
You are

273
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,311
a great master,

274
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,510
you are very important for me.

275
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,276
You teach ten lessons

276
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,278
to workers in my factory.

277
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,476
I pay you in cash,

278
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,471
2,000 euros a lesson

279
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,509
for ten lessons.

280
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,512
We work together,
but no one knows it,

281
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,431
just the two of us.

282
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,316
I need your help.

283
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,311
Think it over.

284
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,358
- What's the cloth like?.
- Come and see.

285
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,429
I've got nothin'!

286
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,476
Don't move!

287
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,432
They must have gone over to his side,

288
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,317
or they'd have arrested
me first and then those other guys.

289
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,477
Believe me?. All of them were there
when I called you.

290
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,318
I said: Check out this car,
it's suspect.

291
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,356
This stuff here is ours.

292
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,357
My gun!

293
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,278
Check this stuff out,
there should be fifty-six.

294
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,390
Good, Toto, this is for you.

295
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,516
How can I get working with you?.

296
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,311
We'll let you know.

297
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,475
- Did you turn off the water?.
- Of course!

298
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,470
- Can I help out?.
- No, you'll get wet.

299
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,435
Doesn't matter!

300
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,271
Come and see.

301
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,316
Careful not to slip.

302
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,319
- Is it coming from the well?.
- No, I think it's from the pipe.

303
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,358
Careful, water's coming in.

304
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,278
See if you can close it.

305
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,396
It's closed,
but it's the pipe that...

306
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,511
I'd give you a hand, but...

307
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,475
What a great day!

308
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,316
Push it all in one direction.

309
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,273
I thought I'd be having coffee!

310
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,432
- Nice coffee, huh?.
- I'll have some next time.

311
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,316
Totore, things okay?.

312
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,432
- Can I say hi?.
- No, you gotta leave.

313
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,273
Go down with these bags!

314
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,316
You have to move!

315
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,391
Ma'am, go around the other way.

316
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,398
- What's going on?.
- Everything's fine, leave.

317
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,475
Lucia?.

318
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,429
Come closer.

319
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,273
- What's your name?.
- Luigi.

320
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,313
- Are you scared?.
- No.

321
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,470
- Sure?.
- No.

322
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,469
We'll see.

323
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,438
- Are you strong?.
- Yeah!

324
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,436
Let's see how strong you are.

325
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,356
Why are you shaking?.

326
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,272
No?.

327
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,352
- See how strong this kid is.
- Come closer!

328
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,318
- Are you scared?.
- Yes.

329
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,311
Now you're a man.

330
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,471
Nothin'! Everything's okay!

331
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,354
When I did my piercing,
I got an infection.

332
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,317
Let's see.

333
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,311
You went and did it there?.

334
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,358
- I'd like to have it on my eyebrow.
- Stinks.

335
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,431
It's nicer there, you're right.

336
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,476
It's gonna rain.

337
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,429
Everything's okay!

338
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,511
A car's coming!

339
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,351
It went in!

340
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,396
It's going in!

341
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,311
Check out this other one!

342
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,391
Everything's okay!

343
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,432
Sorry I'm late, the Councilman,
City Hall, the traffic...

344
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,430
- My father.
- How do you do.

345
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,318
I'm glad he's with you
you're a good person.

346
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,431
He's in your care.

347
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,431
He's a clever guy.

348
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,469
I don't doubt that but...

349
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,393
- Having work is important to him.
- Of course.

350
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,352
I tried so hard
to find him work in Naples...

351
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,477
- Where do you work?.
- In the hospital, intensive care.

352
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,356
A bad division.

353
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,473
I tried to get him in,
but I have no connections.

354
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,311
He's all set now.

355
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,312
You did something no one else did.

356
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,470
I thank you, you raised him well.

357
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,471
Have you always worked in Naples?.

358
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,350
No, also in Trieste, Udine,

359
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,350
- Venice...
- That's where we're going.

360
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,398
I told him about Venice.

361
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,477
He's excited, it's his first time.

362
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,471
Dad, we have a plane.

363
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,316
Did you bring some things?.

364
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,476
What's that, your gym bag?.

365
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,358
- Goodbye.
- He's in your care.

366
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,314
- What do you pay for disposal?.
- Today I'm paying 50.

367
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,515
Your offer?.

368
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,316
We can halve your costs,

369
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,311
25 cents a kilo.

370
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,311
That's good,

371
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,391
but is it all "clean",
like they say in the United States?.

372
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,396
Since it's toxic waste,

373
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,278
certification,
storage and transportation.

374
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,438
- Is there a contract to look over?.
- Of course.

375
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,351
In case you're wondering,

376
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,431
the disposal cycle

377
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,318
goes to the disposal area
in Marcianise.

378
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,316
I'm telling you in fairness.

379
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,470
Thank you for the information,

380
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,515
but my only concern
is that it's "clean".

381
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,356
You can rest assured of that.

382
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,431
We can dispose of all the waste

383
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,516
that you produce in a year.

384
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,435
Eight hundred tons.

385
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,315
It's not a problem.

386
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,515
That's a lot.

387
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,516
My concern is disposal.

388
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,470
We serve various companies,
you can check.

389
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,436
I already have!

390
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,351
Don't worry.

391
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,392
As far as I can see,
there's maximum transparency.

392
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,271
Absolutely.

393
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,477
- The warehouses at Teverola?.
- We use them for tires.

394
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,355
Exactly.

395
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,432
Will we put the tannery waste
in the quarry?.

396
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,273
- Don't talk foolishness.
- Where then?.

397
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,396
Check the European catalogue.

398
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,351
Here they are, 04.

399
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,470
The ones in red,
are among the most dangerous.

400
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,437
"Exhausted degreasing baths
with solvents, no liquid phase."

401
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,508
No, no good.

402
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,431
Then 4-11:

403
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,358
"Waste containing halogenated
compounds from operations

404
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,396
of manufacturing and finishing."

405
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,391
These are good.

406
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,268
It's stuff the earth absorbs,
we'll mix it with compost.

407
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,429
Fertilizer!

408
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,278
All that leaves is
Milan's sweeping refuse,

409
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,271
that's 60 trucks.

410
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,272
- The quarries at San Felice?.
- They're too small.

411
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,316
I don't think so, look.

412
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,397
Let me see.

413
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,470
They're too small
and they're shallow,

414
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,397
they're no good.

415
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,308
Yes... I've got
ten contracts out of ten.

416
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,435
Is he near you?.

417
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,395
Put him on.

418
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,429
I'll talk to him.

419
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,313
I told him, everything's okay.

420
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,312
- Do you like traveling?.
- Sure!

421
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,471
We'll take more trips.

422
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,471
Everyone here works in boats?.

423
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,312
Everyone, firemen, ambulances...

424
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,477
- Funerals.
- I've already seen two.

425
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,311
Even the dead go by boat!

426
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,471
Wow, they've got so many!

427
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,355
Steady me.

428
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,351
There's nothing here.

429
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,431
Nothing?.

430
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,397
Are you sure?.

431
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,351
Oh God!

432
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,356
Look what's here!

433
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,436
See?. It's like you said!

434
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,317
Look here!

435
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,317
A Beretta 93!

436
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,277
A Kalashnikov!

437
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,471
See if they're loaded.

438
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,470
- Check.
- It's unloaded.

439
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,311
Look, an M12!

440
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,476
This is the 921.

441
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,395
That bearded bum!

442
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,516
We'll see how
he blows my head off!

443
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,518
Enough for Casale di Principe!
Everybody!

444
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,356
Won't blow my head off now, eh?.

445
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,476
Should I put two in?.

446
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,351
And Nikita's?.

447
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,351
And the 38?.

448
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,472
- Want to see how I can shoot?.
- Show me!

449
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,357
Show me!

450
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,356
Aim there!

451
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,351
I hit it!

452
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,396
We'll blow
the Colombians' heads off!

453
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,357
That's good.

454
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,397
Everything okay?.

455
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,356
With love and feeling.

456
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,470
- What is it?.
- Your wife's on the phone.

457
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,514
Tell her not to wait up.

458
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,470
Don't get tired out, need anything?.

459
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,435
No, thanks.

460
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,511
- You'll lock up?.
- Yes.

461
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,435
Goodnight.

462
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,351
Xian?.

463
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,475
I have been waiting for you.

464
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,512
- I got lost.
- I am happy you came.

465
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,389
Please sit down.

466
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,436
We are cooking fish.

467
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,316
I've already eaten.

468
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,396
Try a typical Chinese dish.

469
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,435
Okay?.

470
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,358
Just cooked, it is good.

471
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,311
Meat with bell peppers.

472
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,356
I've already eaten.

473
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,469
Taste.

474
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,276
We use chopsticks.

475
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,396
- I don't know how to use them.
- Try!

476
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,356
I am pleased,

477
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,436
we have a little toast.

478
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,273
We go to the factory.

479
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,397
Why not?.

480
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,356
I put a pillow in here.

481
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,357
It's dangerous.

482
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,314
I already told you,
no one can know, just us.

483
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,471
It's better for both of us.

484
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:11,359
- Won't I need air?.
- No, there's an opening.

485
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,358
I'll open the front window,
so air will come in.

486
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,277
Forgive me.

487
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,514
Are we sure?.

488
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,517
It is best for both of us,
because it is dangerous.

489
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,313
- Does air come through here?.
- Yes.

490
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,511
And I'll open the window too.

491
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,311
Please come in, Mr. Pasquale.

492
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,476
All are waiting for you.

493
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,396
All are very happy.

494
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,470
I told them who you are
and all are happy.

495
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,271
What a nice factory!

496
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,476
More than 80 people.

497
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,396
I'm moved.

498
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,356
What can I say?.

499
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,471
To do this work

500
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,273
you need lots of patience...

501
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,431
...and lots of love.

502
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,436
For the first lesson...

503
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,396
...I'll cut out a bodice.

504
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,469
Let's begin.

505
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,312
You must place patterns carefully.

506
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,471
Spread the cloth well...

507
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,356
Maria, are you asleep?.

508
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,430
Where have I been, in China?.

509
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,391
They were all bowing to me.

510
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,311
Master!

511
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,318
They called me "master"!

512
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,312
- Did you know the Chinese can cook?.
- The Chinese?.

513
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,396
Darn right!

514
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,318
They cooked a delicious bass!

515
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,514
There were boxes everywhere

516
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,311
and they put me in the trunk!

517
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,431
Both coming and going.

518
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,514
I need some sleep.

519
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,389
Here.

520
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,356
I have to sleep a few hours.

521
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,396
What's this money?.

522
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,356
Where did you get it?.

523
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,436
I have to sleep.

524
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,311
Help me understand.

525
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,436
I talked to my son this morning,

526
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,318
he said: "Mom I'm leaving,

527
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,476
I'm going to be a secessionist."

528
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,351
Really?.

529
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,316
What did you say?.

530
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,391
He's convinced,

531
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,396
he said: "We're great,

532
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,393
we'll win the war,
the others are nobodies".

533
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,477
War?. A bunch of morons
warring against us?.

534
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,356
You have to stop him.

535
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,436
This side is the right side.

536
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,390
Have you seen what's happening?.

537
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,476
There are killings every day.

538
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,318
Don't say anything to anybody,
not even your husband.

539
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,436
Who'd ever tell him!

540
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,472
When he gets out, what'll he do?.
Father and son will kill each other?.

541
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,356
No, because your son
will stay right here.

542
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,476
They'll all come to a bad end.

543
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,351
Do you feel so sure about that?.

544
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,515
I don't.

545
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,357
I do.

546
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,273
When will we see each other again?.

547
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,271
When you change sides.

548
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,396
Want to stay faithful?. Go ahead!

549
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,390
You go your way and I go another.

550
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,319
But we can still have
a pizza together with friends.

551
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,277
I'm telling you again,

552
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,277
friend, enemy.

553
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,278
We've known each other for so long,
why go with them?.

554
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,397
Remember when we were brothers?.
Now we're enemies.

555
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,354
I'm telling you, if you don't
change sides, we might kill you

556
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,396
or you might kill us.

557
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,436
Because we're at war,

558
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,351
people are dying every day.

559
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,432
- You could have stayed with us...
- What for?.

560
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,476
I'm best on the other side.

561
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,389
Bye, Simone.

562
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,351
Want a little Sambuca?.

563
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,436
You'll be right off, don't worry.

564
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,397
Takes time.

565
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,396
Careful when you go out.

566
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,311
Thank you.

567
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,476
Gaetano, show him.

568
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,471
- It's big.
- You're right.

569
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,435
- Enzo!
- What?.

570
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,278
Do I have to tell you?.

571
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,397
It's awesome.

572
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,389
I like it.

573
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,317
Like it?.

574
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,316
You look great.

575
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,271
Toto, show it off.

576
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,395
It's really nice.

577
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,510
- How many so far?.
- 45 doses.

578
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,435
Okay.

579
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,316
It's good stuff.

580
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,316
How many so far?.

581
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,475
Fifty-two,

582
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,353
plus four that guy's still got.

583
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,277
- Understand?.
- Yeah.

584
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,396
I'll get back to you later.

585
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,272
- How many?.
- Fifty-two and that guy's got four.

586
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,316
Then we'll total it.

587
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,396
Hello!

588
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,515
Nice, eh?.

589
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,351
Hi, gorgeous!

590
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,315
Girls!

591
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,355
Beautiful!

592
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,509
Alessia?.

593
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,398
What are you doing here?. Get out.

594
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,476
I don't want to see you around here.

595
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,312
We have to go crying
at the prison gates?.

596
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,278
What I went through with your father
was enough for me.

597
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,435
Good morning, Jacob.

598
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:59,318
- Are you alright?.
- Fine, thank you, and you?.

599
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,356
Have a good trip?.

600
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,431
A very nice trip.

601
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,352
- Do you have documents?.
- It's humanitarian aid.

602
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,396
Yes, it's humanitarian aid.

603
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,273
- Everything okay?.
- Yes.

604
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,476
They've already called an ambulance.

605
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,514
Get back to work!

606
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,311
Go back to work!

607
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,470
What happened?.

608
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,351
As they were dumping,

609
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,312
two drums opened
and spilled on a truck driver.

610
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,510
- Have you already called zio?.
- No!

611
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,357
- They wanted to call an ambulance!
- I'll take care of this.

612
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,516
Pay the truckers
and tell them to fuck off.

613
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:55,319
- Who'll drive the trucks?.
- Don't the blacks know how?.

614
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,391
Can you drive?.

615
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,398
They can't even ride bikes!

616
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,311
I'll handle this.

617
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,358
Don't let them touch the trucks,
they're ours.

618
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,316
Roberto, wait here.

619
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,429
Calm down!

620
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:23,435
You made a mistake, you had us doing
a job we shouldn't have!

621
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,476
It just happened!

622
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:15,312
- I'm taking the red one.
- No, that's mine!
