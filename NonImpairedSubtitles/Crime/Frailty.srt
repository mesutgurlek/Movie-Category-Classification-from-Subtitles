1
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,880
-What's that ambulance doing there?
-I don't know. I'll check it out.

2
00:03:48,944 --> 00:03:50,652
-Evening, sir.
-How's it going, Griff?

3
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:52,897
I can't complain... and won't.

4
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,319
Is that him?

5
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:58,449
Yep. Might just be some crackpot but
I figured I should call you anyway.

6
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,328
Did he ask for me by name?

7
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:02,034
Nope, asked for the agent
in charge of

8
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:05,083
the "God's Hand" case. Said he had
some important info on it.

9
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:08,710
-Didn't say what?
-Nope. Said he'd only talk to you.

10
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:17,927
You the agent in charge of
the "God's Hand" case?

11
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:20,473
That's right.
Wesley Doyle.

12
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:24,560
That a picture
of you and your mother, huh?

13
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:29,059
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't
take things off my desk.

14
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:31,140
Sorry about that.

15
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:33,278
Guess I've been in here a while.

16
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:37,193
Already had a look at all
your plaques and your citations.

17
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:39,273
Didn't really care
to have a look at those.

18
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,201
What can I do for you, Mr...?

19
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:51,410
Meiks.

20
00:04:52,005 --> 00:04:53,416
My name's Fenton Meiks.

21
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:57,916
Now listen, this may sound
a little bit crazy but...

22
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:03,094
I know who
the "God's Hand" killer is.

23
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:05,636
All right, I'll bite.

24
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:07,842
Who?

25
00:05:09,188 --> 00:05:11,940
You haven't even heard me out yet
and already you doubt me.

26
00:05:13,526 --> 00:05:14,724
Why is that?

27
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:20,153
Because in a case like this
nobody just walks in the office

28
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:21,942
and tells you who the killer is.
It doesn't happen that way.

29
00:05:23,744 --> 00:05:27,907
-Sometimes truth defies reason.
-Yeah?

30
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:29,789
So who is it then?

31
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:32,748
My brother.

32
00:05:34,504 --> 00:05:36,047
What makes you think that?

33
00:05:37,758 --> 00:05:39,715
I got a call from him...

34
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:42,298
last night.

35
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:50,389
Hello?

36
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:54,355
-Hello?
-Demons are taking over the world.

37
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:58,105
Adam?

38
00:05:58,236 --> 00:05:59,896
I can't destroy them all.

39
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:04,146
-I can't take it anymore!
-Now, let's talk about this, Adam.

40
00:06:04,283 --> 00:06:06,240
But there's nothing to talk about!

41
00:06:06,827 --> 00:06:09,235
It's over...
whatever happens,

42
00:06:09,788 --> 00:06:14,331
you have to take me to the rose
garden. You promised, remember?

43
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:16,496
-Now, that's just till...
-Remember?.

44
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:18,123
You promised!

45
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:55,577
Meat?

46
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,492
That's where all this took place.

47
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,290
It's about 200 miles west of here,
just north of Abilene.

48
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:03,422
Why did you go to Thurman?

49
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,166
To bury Adam,
in the rose garden.

50
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,219
Why would you do that?

51
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,592
I promised him I would.
A long time ago.

52
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,258
That's a pretty
wild story, Mr. Meiks.

53
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,891
I don't see what, if anything,
this has got to do with my case.

54
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,562
Adam is the "God's Hand" killer,
Agent Doyle.

55
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,111
He's the one you're looking for.

56
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,989
Did he tell you that before
he asked you to take him to Thurman?

57
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,741
If that's the case,
you left that part out.

58
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,323
I haven't finished yet.

59
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,910
-Oh, there's more?
-A lot more.

60
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,329
Excuse me a minute.

61
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:56,010
Meat Sheriff's office.

62
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:59,966
Can I talk to a sheriff, please?
This is Agent Doyle of the FBI.

63
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:03,601
He's not in right now.
May I help you?

64
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,641
Well, I've got a man here
in my office, name of Fenton Meiks.

65
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:10,021
Fenton Meiks?
What's he doing there?

66
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:15,152
-You know him?
-Hecaused a ruckus here earlier.

67
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:18,410
He stole an ambulance
and his brother's body too.

68
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,083
Did my story check out?

69
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,915
Yeah, it did.

70
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:30,377
So am I under arrest now?

71
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,503
You damn sure should be.

72
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:39,303
The sheriff's willing to forget it
if you bring that ambulance back.

73
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:41,967
Nobody wants to press any charges.

74
00:08:43,478 --> 00:08:47,061
-Well you gotta love small towns.
-Why would you go to all that

75
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:49,639
trouble just to walk in here
and confess it to me?

76
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:53,392
I'm here because I can't live
with what I know anymore.

77
00:08:57,867 --> 00:08:59,409
What exactly do you know?

78
00:09:01,954 --> 00:09:03,117
That is your mother, isn't it?

79
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:06,746
-Yeah, it is.
-I knew it.

80
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:09,412
You got the same eyes.

81
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:11,878
Why don't we
get back to your story?

82
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:14,538
What makes you think

83
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:16,590
that your brother's
the "God's Hand" killer?

84
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:19,005
I know it was him.

85
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:20,966
How do you know?

86
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:24,929
It started back in Thurman.

87
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:30,262
It was near
the summer of 1979.

88
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:05,470
I got the joy, joy, joy, joy
down in my heart.

89
00:10:05,974 --> 00:10:07,469
You're supposed to say, "Where?"

90
00:10:08,185 --> 00:10:09,928
I don't want
to sing that dumb song.

91
00:10:10,395 --> 00:10:12,269
You don't have to sing.
Just say "Where?"

92
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:13,595
All right. Where?

93
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,348
Not now. I'll point
to you when it's time.

94
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:20,312
I got the joy, joy, joy, joy
down in my heart.

95
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:22,315
-Where?
-Down in my heart.

96
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,447
-Where?
-Down in my heart.

97
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:27,991
I got the joy, joy, joy, joy
down in my heart.

98
00:10:28,288 --> 00:10:33,412
And if the devil doesn't
like it, he can sit on a tack.

99
00:10:33,543 --> 00:10:34,953
-Ouch!
-Sit on a tack.

100
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:36,705
-Ouch!
-Sit on a tack.

101
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,505
And if the devil doesn't like it,
he can sit on a tack today.

102
00:10:42,218 --> 00:10:47,045
-Who was that chick that threw up?
-Katie Hagen. She's sure pretty.

103
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:49,678
-It was real messy though.
-Oh, yeah.

104
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:53,341
All over the floor!
And when the principal fell...

105
00:10:56,148 --> 00:10:57,346
I got the joy, joy, joy, joy...

106
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,766
We lived right behind
the Thurman Public Rose Garden

107
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,440
in the house where they used to keep
the gardeners back in the fifties.

108
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:07,199
Dad had gotten a good deal on it
back when he and Mom got married.

109
00:11:09,828 --> 00:11:13,493
The unexpected incident that
creates those dangerous moments.

110
00:11:14,415 --> 00:11:16,740
The ropes were suddenly
off the alligator.

111
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:18,910
Adam was 3 years
younger than me.

112
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,454
Our Mom died
giving birth to him, so

113
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:25,301
I basically took care
of him ever since I can remember.

114
00:11:27,928 --> 00:11:30,217
Our Dad worked as a mechanic
over in Jupiter.

115
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:34,385
He usually got home around 5.30
and we'd all have dinner together.

116
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,478
-Hey, kiddos.
-Hey, Dad.

117
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:40,480
Something sure smells good.

118
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:49,445
-How was your day?
-It was all right.

119
00:11:50,283 --> 00:11:51,564
Let's eat.

120
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:57,990
-Whoa, Tiger. Save some for us.
-I sure love peas.

121
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:01,784
You must. You better be careful,
though. You might turn into one.

122
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:07,423
-How did you do on that math test?
-I barely passed.

123
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:12,258
Well, I was never
any good at math either.

124
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:15,172
Shoot, I still can't do
anything without a calculator.

125
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:17,597
Yeah, but there's going
to be another test next week.

126
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:20,597
-And that one's going to be harder.
-Hey, don't sound so glum.

127
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,942
Tell you what,
we'll sit down this weekend

128
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:28,649
and we'll see if we can't figure out
that junk together, okay?

129
00:12:28,945 --> 00:12:30,108
All right.

130
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,656
Hey, Fenton. Can we go see
"Meatballs" after school tomorrow?

131
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:39,531
-We've already seen it.
-I want to see it again.

132
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,081
Nah, we're gonna go
see "The Warriors."

133
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,247
-Can't. It's rated R.
-We'll sneak in.

134
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:47,749
Teeth all brushed?

135
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:50,959
You sure about that, Adam?
All right.

136
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:52,544
Breath test time.

137
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:56,215
Dad!
I did

138
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:58,595
-brush them!
-I'm just joking with you, egghead!

139
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:02,054
Don't worry, Fenton. I know
you're too big for a goodnight kiss.

140
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:04,802
Sleep tight.

141
00:13:04,938 --> 00:13:06,646
Don't let those bedbugs bite.

142
00:13:06,815 --> 00:13:09,602
That's right.
Love you guys.

143
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:11,811
-Love you too, Dad.
-Night, Dad.

144
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,607
Night, Curtis.

145
00:13:16,616 --> 00:13:18,443
I wanna see "Meatballs" again.

146
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,069
Fine, you can see "Meatballs"

147
00:13:21,246 --> 00:13:23,073
and I'll see "The Warriors."

148
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:26,157
But I don't like
to watch movies by myself.

149
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:27,705
Too bad.

150
00:13:28,753 --> 00:13:29,868
Please?

151
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:34,336
All right.
Just go to bed.

152
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:44,349
That was our family.
Just the three of us.

153
00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:49,185
AII of Mom and Dad's relatives had
died, so there was no-one but us.

154
00:13:50,357 --> 00:13:51,472
We didn't mind though.

155
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:54,061
We didn't need anybody else.

156
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,684
We were happy

157
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:57,938
together. Until...

158
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:00,990
-Fenton, wake up.
-Dad?

159
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,448
-I've got something to tell you.
-What's wrong?

160
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,533
It's okay.

161
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:06,997
Adam, wake up and listen.

162
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:10,575
I need you both
to listen to me very carefully.

163
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,371
Something's happened.

164
00:14:15,757 --> 00:14:18,082
He said he'd had
a vision that night.

165
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,919
A vision from God.

166
00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:48,621
An angel came to him

167
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:50,781
and told him
the truth of this world

168
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,499
and revealed God's
special purpose for our family.

169
00:14:57,338 --> 00:14:59,711
The end of the world
is coming. It's near.

170
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:01,585
The angel showed me.

171
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:05,010
There are demons among us.

172
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:07,635
The devil has released them
for the final battle.

173
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:10,430
It's being fought right now.

174
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:15,847
But nobody knows it
except us and others like us.

175
00:15:16,357 --> 00:15:20,057
-I'm scared, Dad.
-There's nothing to be afraid of.

176
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:24,943
We've been chosen by God. He will
protect us. He's given us special

177
00:15:25,073 --> 00:15:26,402
jobs to do.

178
00:15:28,118 --> 00:15:31,321
We don't fear these demons,
we destroy them.

179
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,329
We pick them up one by one, and
we pitch them out of this world.

180
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:38,290
That's God's purpose for us.

181
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:41,046
The angel called us "God's Hands."

182
00:15:41,214 --> 00:15:43,041
So we're like superheroes?

183
00:15:43,591 --> 00:15:44,789
That's right.

184
00:15:44,968 --> 00:15:47,719
We're a family of superheroes
that are gonna help save the world.

185
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,302
But, Dad, that
doesn't make any sense.

186
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:55,892
I know it sounds that way,
son, but it's the truth.

187
00:15:56,979 --> 00:15:59,019
So what are our superpowers?

188
00:15:59,148 --> 00:16:00,428
Well...

189
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,183
we can see the demons
while other people can't.

190
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,860
The angel told me God would send us
3 weapons to destroy them with.

191
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:12,529
Magical weapons?

192
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,490
I imagine so.

193
00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:18,245
When do we get them?

194
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,493
I don't know.
The angel just said soon.

195
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:26,380
That's all I was told, except
we're not supposed to tell anybody.

196
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:27,960
Absolutely no-one.

197
00:16:28,343 --> 00:16:32,008
If we do, we put them
and ourselves in danger.

198
00:16:34,974 --> 00:16:36,005
Fenton?

199
00:16:37,226 --> 00:16:40,560
Don't worry, it's okay.
It's a lot to understand.

200
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:45,772
I waited to tell you until I had
a chance to figure it out myself.

201
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:49,063
But the angel said
I had to do it now.

202
00:16:50,114 --> 00:16:51,193
Fenton?

203
00:16:53,158 --> 00:16:55,365
I didn't know
what to say or how to feel.

204
00:16:55,828 --> 00:17:00,074
Do you understand what I told you?
Judgment Day is here.

205
00:17:00,332 --> 00:17:04,116
It was too messed up
to understand or even acknowledge.

206
00:17:04,252 --> 00:17:08,665
Soon we'll all be in Heaven.
You, me, Adam. With Mommy.

207
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,592
I didn't realize it at the moment,
at least not consciously...

208
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,170
She's waiting
to see us in Heaven.

209
00:17:13,344 --> 00:17:16,927
but my happy and mostly secure world
had just been flipped over.

210
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,632
-And there were dark things there.
-Judgment Day is here.

211
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:21,054
Very dark things.

212
00:17:21,728 --> 00:17:23,270
We've been chosen by God.

213
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:25,638
And my little boy's mind
just couldn't take it.

214
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:35,155
Adam! Fenton!

215
00:17:38,786 --> 00:17:40,410
Up and at'em, boys!

216
00:17:50,464 --> 00:17:52,456
Morning, kiddo.
Hey, come on,

217
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:54,625
lazybones. It's late.
We overslept.

218
00:17:58,138 --> 00:17:59,418
Let's go.
Snap to it and

219
00:17:59,597 --> 00:18:02,931
get dressed. I gotta get to work.
Drop you guys off on the way.

220
00:18:05,144 --> 00:18:06,224
What's wrong with you?

221
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:11,307
Nothing.

222
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:30,328
Hey, let me have a bite of that.

223
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:36,881
None of us mentioned it.
It was only a dream, a nightmare.

224
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:42,678
Nothing that crazy could be real.

225
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:46,174
Everything was okay,
just like before.

226
00:18:52,774 --> 00:18:57,317
Have a good day at school, boys.
And remember not to tell anyone.

227
00:18:57,487 --> 00:18:59,111
We won't, Dad. Bye.

228
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,281
Okay, now. I want you all to copy
down this sentence. We're gonna go

229
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,916
through the structure.
"The girl in

230
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:19,256
the blue dress..."

231
00:19:21,802 --> 00:19:23,426
I refused to believe it.

232
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:27,132
-"walked..."
-That next week was a dream too.

233
00:19:29,517 --> 00:19:30,549
"her...

234
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,014
brown dog."

235
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:36,687
Like when Dad started bringing
home the "magical" weapons.

236
00:19:39,277 --> 00:19:40,819
He was on his way to work...

237
00:19:43,114 --> 00:19:44,489
when God called to him.

238
00:20:29,951 --> 00:20:31,326
Be careful.

239
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,868
I still can't understand
what these gloves are for though.

240
00:20:43,338 --> 00:20:45,082
Just a long, long dream.

241
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:48,377
I want you to write this down at the
Top of your pages in big letters.

242
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,347
Boys! Boys, look at this.

243
00:21:02,107 --> 00:21:03,269
We got them all.

244
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:05,984
It won't be long now.

245
00:21:06,444 --> 00:21:08,650
The angel came again
last night and told me

246
00:21:08,821 --> 00:21:12,024
that God will be sending us
a list of the first 7 demons soon.

247
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:14,948
It wasn't real.
It couldn't be.

248
00:21:15,786 --> 00:21:17,411
I just had to wait it out.

249
00:21:23,252 --> 00:21:25,873
-Come over here a minute, Fenton.
-I'm washing dishes.

250
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:29,124
That can wait. Come here.
I want to talk to you.

251
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,108
I know you've had some trouble
adjusting to everything.

252
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:49,735
And I'm sorry.

253
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,321
But God has willed this
and we must obey God.

254
00:21:55,366 --> 00:21:57,193
Maybe you just dreamed it.

255
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:02,121
I didn't dream it. I wouldn't
make up something like that, son.

256
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:05,907
Maybe...

257
00:22:09,672 --> 00:22:12,423
Maybe you're not
right in the head.

258
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:15,585
It happened, Fenton.
It's true.

259
00:22:16,845 --> 00:22:18,256
You'll see that soon.

260
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:23,434
That's what I wanted to talk
to you about. I got the first list.

261
00:22:27,063 --> 00:22:29,222
The angel came to him
while he was at work.

262
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:43,674
Dad,

263
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:47,390
-these are people's names.
-That's right.

264
00:23:47,891 --> 00:23:49,800
And they'll look
like people too.

265
00:23:50,227 --> 00:23:51,425
But they're not.

266
00:23:54,064 --> 00:23:56,519
The angel said
when I lay my hands on them

267
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,523
I'll reveal them
for what they truly are.

268
00:24:00,028 --> 00:24:01,819
That's what the gloves are for.

269
00:24:02,072 --> 00:24:04,278
I get them and bring them
back here with the gloves on,

270
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:07,659
and once they're back here, I take
the gloves off and reveal them.

271
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:11,951
You'll see.
Then you'll believe.

272
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:14,040
Does anyone know
what this word means?

273
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,916
Do you remember
what this word means?

274
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:20,161
The dream had finally ended.
It was all real.

275
00:24:24,718 --> 00:24:26,462
And I had to stop him.

276
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:31,385
The obvious answer was to tell
someone what he was planning.

277
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:33,643
But I couldn't do that.

278
00:24:35,103 --> 00:24:37,594
I loved him even
if he had gone crazy.

279
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,147
Dad, look, I got a list too.

280
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:43,521
Where did you get this, Adam?

281
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:45,148
God gave it to me.

282
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,619
Isn't Travis Shed that boy that was
picking on you at school last week?

283
00:24:52,162 --> 00:24:53,276
He's a demon.

284
00:24:54,956 --> 00:24:56,201
Tell the truth, Adam.

285
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:59,076
You made this list up
yourself, didn't you?

286
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:01,376
-No, God did.
-Adam?

287
00:25:03,548 --> 00:25:04,746
Come on, right here.

288
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:08,086
Now, listen to me, son.

289
00:25:08,969 --> 00:25:10,761
You can't make stuff like that up.

290
00:25:11,472 --> 00:25:13,096
We destroy demons.

291
00:25:13,265 --> 00:25:16,599
If we were to use your list,
we'd be killing people.

292
00:25:17,436 --> 00:25:19,013
And we can never do that.

293
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:21,722
Now, destroying demons
is a good thing.

294
00:25:21,899 --> 00:25:23,097
Killing people is bad.

295
00:25:23,275 --> 00:25:24,473
You understand?

296
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,308
I'm sorry, Dad.

297
00:25:26,486 --> 00:25:28,395
That's all right.
It's okay.

298
00:25:29,072 --> 00:25:32,073
You just got to have
a little patience. Don't worry.

299
00:25:32,492 --> 00:25:34,650
God will send you
your own list when you're older.

300
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:36,987
Okay. Godo some homework.

301
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:50,291
The only thing
left to do was to tell.

302
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,264
That was easier said than done.

303
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:18,197
Dad had promised to take us
to the movies that night,

304
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:22,782
but he didn't come home from work.

305
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,036
When's Dad coming home?

306
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:27,373
I don't know.

307
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,998
Think he's destroying a demon?

308
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,547
-It's all make-believe, Adam.
-No, it's not. It's true.

309
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:39,671
Listen to me. None of that demon
junk is real. Daddy just made it up.

310
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,842
-No, he didn't.
-He did too.

311
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:45,600
Just like Santa Claus.

312
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:49,857
You remember when you caught Dad
putting our presents under the tree?

313
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,396
It's just like that.

314
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:54,566
Adam,

315
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,977
have I ever lied to you?

316
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,147
All right, look.

317
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:03,408
Dad made up this whole thing. The
names on his list are real people.

318
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,240
Do you understand?

319
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,285
-But why would he make it up?
-I don't know.

320
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,586
But I think we should leave.

321
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:14,705
You mean... run away?

322
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:17,418
Will you go with me?
Only for

323
00:27:17,593 --> 00:27:20,511
-a little while.
-I don't want to leave Dad.

324
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:22,472
Neither do I.

325
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,510
But we might have to.

326
00:27:26,185 --> 00:27:27,134
Why?

327
00:27:32,524 --> 00:27:34,232
Dad's gonna kill somebody.

328
00:28:40,048 --> 00:28:41,459
Son, come over here.

329
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,719
Come on, I need your help.

330
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:10,941
Dad?

331
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,151
Come on out here, Adam.

332
00:29:19,377 --> 00:29:20,836
Shine that light over here.

333
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:26,125
Hey, Dad, who is that?

334
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,586
That's a demon, son.

335
00:29:32,223 --> 00:29:34,429
Come on in here, boys.
It's all right.

336
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:37,052
Goon, don't be afraid.

337
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,289
God came to him earlier that day
and told him that the time had come.

338
00:30:03,795 --> 00:30:06,037
After work he drove
down to Jacksonville,

339
00:30:06,381 --> 00:30:08,919
about 45 minutes or so
southwest of Thurman.

340
00:30:10,635 --> 00:30:14,051
He said he'd never been there before
but he had no problem finding it.

341
00:30:14,973 --> 00:30:16,515
God was leading him.

342
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:49,417
-Cynthia Harbridge?
-Yes?

343
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:05,102
-Dad, don't. Please don't.
-Fenton,

344
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,055
if I could spare
you this, I would.

345
00:31:09,817 --> 00:31:13,268
But we are God's servants
and His will must be served.

346
00:31:17,324 --> 00:31:19,068
Don't be afraid, son.

347
00:31:43,183 --> 00:31:44,641
Is that true?

348
00:31:46,102 --> 00:31:47,680
Why would I make it up?

349
00:31:49,105 --> 00:31:50,813
Where's your father now?

350
00:31:52,692 --> 00:31:53,723
Dead.

351
00:31:55,987 --> 00:31:58,063
Sir, I was thinking
about heading out.

352
00:31:58,531 --> 00:32:00,191
Unless you need me to stay.

353
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,112
No.

354
00:32:03,452 --> 00:32:04,946
That's all right.
You go ahead.

355
00:32:05,746 --> 00:32:07,026
Have a good night, sir.

356
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:19,669
So he killed that woman
right there in front of you?

357
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,550
But not to his way of thinking.

358
00:32:23,597 --> 00:32:27,131
You see, to him he hadn't killed
a woman, he'd destroyed a demon.

359
00:32:29,602 --> 00:32:32,556
He believed that when
he laid his hands on her,

360
00:32:32,814 --> 00:32:34,522
it revealed her sins.

361
00:33:31,871 --> 00:33:33,069
Dad, don't! Please!

362
00:34:20,835 --> 00:34:22,033
No, Adam.

363
00:34:26,423 --> 00:34:27,917
Do it like this.

364
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:33,171
It's gotta be done
in a certain way.

365
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:35,132
The angel was real specific.

366
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:38,011
Why out here
in the rose garden?

367
00:34:38,185 --> 00:34:39,892
God chose it.

368
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:42,393
Just like He chose us, I suppose.

369
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:46,389
Don't cry for her, Fenton.

370
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:48,893
She wasn't human.

371
00:34:50,863 --> 00:34:52,903
Didn't you see
when I touched her?

372
00:34:53,741 --> 00:34:55,235
I saw it, Dad.

373
00:35:00,122 --> 00:35:01,581
You killed her.

374
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,541
I didn't kill her, son.

375
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,619
I destroyed her.
She was a demon.

376
00:35:10,466 --> 00:35:12,838
You know, I wasn't so sure
I could do it myself.

377
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,382
I mean, she looked like
a woman to me too.

378
00:35:15,804 --> 00:35:17,548
But after I touched her,

379
00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:20,758
all I could see was the evil.

380
00:35:21,476 --> 00:35:23,054
And I had to do it.

381
00:35:24,938 --> 00:35:27,144
I'm sorry you
didn't see it too.

382
00:35:28,191 --> 00:35:29,389
You will next time.

383
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,149
You... you're gonna do it again?

384
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:36,488
This is our job now, son.

385
00:35:37,283 --> 00:35:38,742
You've got to accept that.

386
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,368
I won't let you.

387
00:35:41,537 --> 00:35:44,538
-We are doing God's work here.
-I'll tell.

388
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,166
If you do, someone will die.

389
00:35:48,377 --> 00:35:50,417
The angel was clear on that.
Do you understand?

390
00:35:52,173 --> 00:35:54,580
Answer me, Fenton.
Do you understand?

391
00:35:58,637 --> 00:36:00,096
So you didn't tell?

392
00:36:01,557 --> 00:36:03,514
No. I should have,
but I was afraid.

393
00:36:04,935 --> 00:36:07,426
I mean, I loved my father,
but I was terrified of him.

394
00:36:08,772 --> 00:36:09,886
So now you understand

395
00:36:10,065 --> 00:36:12,390
why I know my brother
is the "God's Hand" killer?

396
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,269
Have you got
any physical proof?

397
00:36:16,654 --> 00:36:18,232
I read in the paper

398
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:23,440
that only one of the bodies of the 6
victims had been found. Is it true?

399
00:36:24,495 --> 00:36:26,322
You read it
in the papers, didn't you?

400
00:36:26,456 --> 00:36:28,329
It doesn't necessarily
mean it's true.

401
00:36:28,499 --> 00:36:30,408
Well, in this case it does.

402
00:36:31,294 --> 00:36:34,330
See, the first victim
was found mutilated

403
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:37,628
with a note saying that
God's Hand had taken him.

404
00:36:39,134 --> 00:36:41,507
All the rest, only notes
were found. No bodies.

405
00:36:42,513 --> 00:36:43,841
How do you know they're dead?

406
00:36:44,014 --> 00:36:45,129
Oh, we don't for sure.

407
00:36:46,058 --> 00:36:49,723
But the first note said we wouldn't
find any more bodies from then on.

408
00:36:50,729 --> 00:36:51,760
Said

409
00:36:52,898 --> 00:36:54,392
he wanted to keep them.

410
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:58,897
I got a pretty good idea
where the rest of them bodies are.

411
00:37:00,905 --> 00:37:02,186
The rose garden?

412
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,485
Now why didn't you
tell me that in the first place?

413
00:37:08,663 --> 00:37:09,908
Would you have believed me?

414
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:13,490
Come on.

415
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,381
Here.

416
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:35,142
What's this?

417
00:37:36,356 --> 00:37:37,732
Put them on.

418
00:37:38,525 --> 00:37:40,103
Or I'll put them on for you.

419
00:37:50,703 --> 00:37:51,735
Let's go.

420
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:34,536
So tell me something.

421
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:37,746
Why didn't you come see me sooner?

422
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:42,414
You're gonna wanna
get on 30 east up here.

423
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,505
I can't imagine how you can keep
something like that inside so long.

424
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,552
I guess I avoided it

425
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,222
because I wanted to.

426
00:39:02,064 --> 00:39:05,397
You never did tell me why it is you
just keep one picture of your mother

427
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:06,765
in your office.

428
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,568
My mother was murdered a couple days
after that picture was taken.

429
00:39:19,372 --> 00:39:22,326
Butchered by some whacked-out
killer like your dad.

430
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:26,658
Did they ever catch him?

431
00:39:28,673 --> 00:39:29,669
No.

432
00:39:31,217 --> 00:39:32,925
Is that why you took this job?

433
00:39:35,012 --> 00:39:38,381
You're pretty good at this.
You ever think about becoming a cop?

434
00:39:41,227 --> 00:39:42,934
Well, you know,
when I was a kid.

435
00:39:44,897 --> 00:39:46,806
Well, you got
the instincts for it.

436
00:39:47,858 --> 00:39:49,851
A cop's gotta have
good instincts.

437
00:39:51,236 --> 00:39:53,110
You know what mine
are telling me now?

438
00:39:55,407 --> 00:39:57,316
You're hiding
something from me.

439
00:39:59,286 --> 00:40:00,910
What is it
you think I'm hiding?

440
00:40:02,706 --> 00:40:05,576
Why don't you just keep talking?
Maybe I'll figure it out.

441
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,300
You okay, Dad?

442
00:40:18,095 --> 00:40:21,013
I'm all right, son.
Here I come.

443
00:40:25,102 --> 00:40:28,138
Dad, why did God
let this happen to me?

444
00:40:28,314 --> 00:40:30,851
Don't blame God, Davy.
It wasn't His fault.

445
00:40:31,025 --> 00:40:32,567
God let me do it.

446
00:40:32,693 --> 00:40:36,311
What God lets you do is decide
for yourself what you will do.

447
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:40,530
-You're not a puppet with strings.
-#No.#

448
00:40:40,992 --> 00:40:43,400
So God doesn't make
you do anything.

449
00:40:43,703 --> 00:40:45,945
He wants you
to decide for yourself.

450
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:49,705
After that night,
nothing much happened.

451
00:40:50,835 --> 00:40:53,836
Dad didn't mention it
anymore. Neither did Adam.

452
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:59,384
Once a full month had gone by, I'd
completely convinced myself it was

453
00:40:59,552 --> 00:41:01,343
over and everything
was gonna be all right.

454
00:41:02,805 --> 00:41:04,714
-Bye.
-See you all later.

455
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:07,259
Did you see
"Dukes of Hazard" last night?

456
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:09,179
Remember when Daisy Duke bent over?

457
00:41:09,353 --> 00:41:11,346
I like Boss Hogg.
He's funny.

458
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:14,895
Man, I'd do anything
to really see her tits.

459
00:41:16,402 --> 00:41:18,145
-Ahhh... you said "tits."
-Shut up, Adam.

460
00:41:18,654 --> 00:41:21,192
You wanna spend the night tonight?
We can wrap Corey's house.

461
00:41:21,365 --> 00:41:24,983
-I'll have to ask Dad though.
-My mom can ask if you want.

462
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,987
-Sure.
-I'll see you in a little bit.

463
00:41:27,162 --> 00:41:29,735
-Bye.
-Hey, what's "wrap" mean?

464
00:41:30,749 --> 00:41:32,492
Tell you later.
Come on, I'll race you.

465
00:41:49,433 --> 00:41:50,429
Come on!

466
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:53,392
No, I'm gonna go
round on the road.

467
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:22,295
-Dad?
-In here.

468
00:42:25,218 --> 00:42:26,629
Whose van is that out there?

469
00:42:26,803 --> 00:42:28,760
Ours. Ain't she a beauty?

470
00:42:30,807 --> 00:42:32,598
You friend's mom just called.

471
00:42:33,226 --> 00:42:34,506
I told her not tonight.

472
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,929
We got some work
To do in the morning.

473
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:56,535
Dad told us that there were moments
when people could just disappear

474
00:42:56,748 --> 00:42:58,955
without anyone knowing
where they went or why.

475
00:42:59,876 --> 00:43:03,494
He said those were the moments
when God's Hands could take you.

476
00:43:04,714 --> 00:43:07,751
According to Dad, nothing,
not even a camera, could catch us.

477
00:43:07,926 --> 00:43:09,088
We were invisible

478
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,004
when we were God's Hands.

479
00:43:11,888 --> 00:43:13,347
What do we do now, Dad?

480
00:43:13,514 --> 00:43:17,642
We'll get him when he comes out
just like I told you, remember?

481
00:43:18,603 --> 00:43:19,634
Fenton?

482
00:43:20,605 --> 00:43:23,855
-I can't do this, Dad.
-"Can't" never could do anything.

483
00:43:23,983 --> 00:43:25,975
-I can do it, Dad.
-You sure can,

484
00:43:26,152 --> 00:43:27,147
tiger.

485
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:31,608
-Well, what if someone sees us?
-They won't.

486
00:43:31,824 --> 00:43:36,320
-It's broad daylight.
-God will blind them for us.

487
00:44:15,449 --> 00:44:16,908
There he is, boys.

488
00:44:18,786 --> 00:44:20,743
-Come on, Fenton.
-Dad, I can't.

489
00:44:21,163 --> 00:44:24,199
Yes, you can. Now move.
Do what I tell you!

490
00:44:32,549 --> 00:44:36,000
Please, Trixie!
Trixie, come on!

491
00:44:36,303 --> 00:44:38,425
Come, Trixie!
Trixie, come on!

492
00:44:38,596 --> 00:44:40,055
What you doing, boy?

493
00:44:40,306 --> 00:44:41,682
My dog...

494
00:44:42,392 --> 00:44:43,720
she's under your car.

495
00:44:44,936 --> 00:44:46,181
Oh, well, let's see.

496
00:44:52,443 --> 00:44:53,985
Help me grab his legs.

497
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:58,315
Help me grab his legs now!
Come on!

498
00:45:03,621 --> 00:45:05,079
Edward March.

499
00:45:07,124 --> 00:45:08,618
You think that's
an innocent man there,

500
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:10,785
don't you?
Well, it's not.

501
00:45:38,029 --> 00:45:39,060
You didn't think anyone

502
00:45:39,238 --> 00:45:40,982
knew about that, did you?

503
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:43,529
-But God saw you.
-Dad, don't! Please!

504
00:45:43,701 --> 00:45:44,780
Quiet!

505
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:48,611
And you can't escape God's wrath!

506
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,342
Can't believe
you still didn't see it.

507
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:13,599
He was the murderer
of little children, Fenton.

508
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:15,559
Babies.

509
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:21,898
Babies.

510
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,622
He's the murderer.

511
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,743
We gotta get out of here, Adam.

512
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,457
-What do you mean?
-Gotta run away.

513
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,624
Told you we might have to.

514
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,673
I don't wanna run away.

515
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,130
-We have to.
-Why?

516
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,801
Listen to me, Adam.

517
00:46:53,476 --> 00:46:56,181
-Dad kills people.
-No, he doesn't.

518
00:46:56,354 --> 00:46:59,141
-He's a demon slayer.
-That's all lies, Adam.

519
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:02,309
No, it's not.
I see it when he touches them.

520
00:47:02,527 --> 00:47:06,987
No, you don't. Dad's brainwashed
you. It's all a big lie.

521
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:09,780
He's a murderer
and you help him.

522
00:47:09,951 --> 00:47:13,818
No! We're just serving God's will.
I'm telling Dad on you!

523
00:47:13,996 --> 00:47:15,656
Adam! Adam! Adam!

524
00:47:41,398 --> 00:47:42,975
Get up and get dressed.

525
00:47:43,983 --> 00:47:45,561
And don't wake your brother.

526
00:47:58,623 --> 00:47:59,737
Sit down.

527
00:48:06,797 --> 00:48:08,624
Your brother told me
what you said last night.

528
00:48:13,095 --> 00:48:15,882
I want you to know I've never
killed anything in my whole life.

529
00:48:16,306 --> 00:48:18,133
That's a lie
and you know it.

530
00:48:23,438 --> 00:48:26,225
I did a lot of thinking
and praying after you went to bed.

531
00:48:29,444 --> 00:48:31,520
I asked the angel to visit you.

532
00:48:33,114 --> 00:48:34,656
But instead he visited me.

533
00:48:36,826 --> 00:48:41,287
And he told me something...
I don't want to believe.

534
00:48:45,126 --> 00:48:46,121
What?

535
00:48:48,671 --> 00:48:50,213
It doesn't matter.

536
00:48:50,589 --> 00:48:53,258
Because together you and I
are gonna prove him wrong.

537
00:48:56,053 --> 00:48:57,844
You just don't have any faith.

538
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:00,387
That's why
you can't see the truth.

539
00:49:03,143 --> 00:49:04,970
But we're gonna change that.

540
00:49:22,286 --> 00:49:24,279
I want you to dig
a hole right here.

541
00:49:24,997 --> 00:49:28,200
Need to be
about 10 feet deep and

542
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:30,827
15 feet wide on both sides.

543
00:49:31,629 --> 00:49:34,962
The length and the width
should form a perfect square.

544
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,792
-What?
-You heard me.

545
00:49:41,472 --> 00:49:42,634
Why?

546
00:49:43,265 --> 00:49:46,764
Because I'm your father and you'll
do what I tell you. Understand?

547
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:50,761
-Do you?
-Yes, sir.

548
00:49:51,481 --> 00:49:56,190
All right. I expect half that to be
dug by the time I get home tonight.

549
00:49:56,987 --> 00:49:58,730
-Dad, I can't do that.
-Pray!

550
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:21,382
I started digging that goddamn
hole, but I did not pray.

551
00:50:21,802 --> 00:50:23,177
I would not.

552
00:50:23,804 --> 00:50:26,260
I hated God,
I despised Him.

553
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:30,177
My hatred helped me dig,
kept me going.

554
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:35,981
Dad's or God's or whoever's plan
it was, it would not work on me.

555
00:50:36,149 --> 00:50:38,901
I knew what Dad
was doing was wrong,

556
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:41,026
and nothing
was gonna change that.

557
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:43,479
Fenton?

558
00:50:46,409 --> 00:50:47,784
Sorry I told on you.

559
00:50:55,543 --> 00:50:58,746
-You tell him about running away?
-No.

560
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,994
Will you go with me then?

561
00:51:00,172 --> 00:51:01,548
There's no reason to go.

562
00:51:01,716 --> 00:51:04,041
-He's a killer.
-No, he's not.

563
00:51:05,594 --> 00:51:08,381
I've been praying for you.
Have you been praying?

564
00:51:08,556 --> 00:51:10,714
Nope, and I'm not going to!

565
00:51:10,849 --> 00:51:13,305
-But Dad said...
-I don't care what Dad said!

566
00:51:13,852 --> 00:51:17,268
He might be able to make me dig
this hole but he can't make me pray.

567
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,727
Just get out of here
and leave me alone.

568
00:51:22,569 --> 00:51:24,277
I'll help you if you promise
you won't tell Dad.

569
00:51:24,446 --> 00:51:26,237
-I don't want your help.
-But there's another

570
00:51:26,406 --> 00:51:28,695
-shovel in the shed.
-Get out of here!

571
00:51:28,825 --> 00:51:29,821
Butthole!

572
00:51:33,913 --> 00:51:36,583
I wanted to run away...
far away, but

573
00:51:36,749 --> 00:51:40,201
I still couldn't leave Adam,
no matter how crazy Dad was turning.

574
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,040
Besides, there was nowhere to go.

575
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,377
-Finally gave up, huh, kiddo?
-I'll be there again in the morning.

576
00:52:26,381 --> 00:52:28,420
Come on,
I didn't mean it like that.

577
00:52:28,925 --> 00:52:30,502
I don't want
to fight with you, son.

578
00:52:31,844 --> 00:52:33,587
I'm not doing this to hurt you.

579
00:52:34,138 --> 00:52:35,680
Wish you could understand that.

580
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:41,894
What's the matter with you?

581
00:52:42,062 --> 00:52:43,722
-Nothing.
-Let me see your hands.

582
00:52:43,897 --> 00:52:45,392
-They're fine.
-Let me see them.

583
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,442
Didn't you wear gloves today?

584
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:50,603
I didn't need them. I'm fine.

585
00:52:57,744 --> 00:52:58,693
Here.

586
00:53:00,705 --> 00:53:02,034
Help ease the pain.

587
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:05,250
I said I was fine.

588
00:53:06,085 --> 00:53:10,083
I know you're mad at me but that's
no reason to cause yourself pain.

589
00:53:13,134 --> 00:53:15,340
I got an extra pair
of work gloves in the shed.

590
00:53:15,511 --> 00:53:17,420
I want you to use
these from now on.

591
00:53:19,056 --> 00:53:21,594
It won't do you any good now that
you've wrecked your hands, but

592
00:53:22,059 --> 00:53:23,388
a couple of days
and you'll be fine.

593
00:53:26,814 --> 00:53:28,640
I want you to know
I'm proud of you.

594
00:53:28,941 --> 00:53:30,850
And I know God's
proud of you too.

595
00:53:33,862 --> 00:53:36,614
Take some time off and let
those blisters callous over.

596
00:53:36,782 --> 00:53:38,691
Then you can get
back to it, all right?

597
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,285
Well, good night then.

598
00:53:48,168 --> 00:53:49,911
Come on, tiger.
Bedtime.

599
00:53:50,712 --> 00:53:53,037
Fenton gets to stay up.
Please, Dad?

600
00:53:53,756 --> 00:53:54,705
Come on.

601
00:53:57,427 --> 00:53:59,715
Brush your teeth. I'll be in
to say goodnight in a minute.

602
00:54:07,061 --> 00:54:08,436
I kept digging.

603
00:54:09,688 --> 00:54:11,811
My hands bled,
but I wouldn't stop.

604
00:54:19,406 --> 00:54:22,573
I kept at it morning,
noon and night for 5 days.

605
00:54:23,535 --> 00:54:26,571
And by the sixth day,
that hole was as dark

606
00:54:26,746 --> 00:54:29,035
as my hatred for Dad's God.

607
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,992
Well, you finished it all right.

608
00:54:34,003 --> 00:54:36,329
Betcha you didn't pray once
the whole time, did you?

609
00:54:37,257 --> 00:54:38,336
Nope.

610
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,756
We started the cellar after that.

611
00:54:48,017 --> 00:54:49,974
At least that's
what Dad called it.

612
00:54:50,853 --> 00:54:52,228
But I knew better.

613
00:54:53,939 --> 00:54:56,265
We were building
a dungeon down there.

614
00:54:59,153 --> 00:55:01,774
We basically built
a big wooden box in the ground.

615
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:03,988
Good, boys. Get it
over there. Cover it good.

616
00:55:04,116 --> 00:55:05,693
Dad said it would hold.

617
00:55:06,952 --> 00:55:08,826
He said God would see to it.

618
00:55:09,663 --> 00:55:11,240
Get back here
and help me push!

619
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:14,452
Come on. Keep it going!

620
00:55:14,626 --> 00:55:18,042
Push it! Go! Go!
Keep it moving! Keep it moving!

621
00:55:30,433 --> 00:55:33,553
You boys did good.
Especially you, Fenton.

622
00:55:33,936 --> 00:55:36,143
No. I just did as I was told.

623
00:55:49,409 --> 00:55:52,410
-Well, what do you think?
-All right.

624
00:55:56,416 --> 00:55:58,409
The next night he brought
home another demon.

625
00:56:04,382 --> 00:56:05,711
Get down there.

626
00:56:13,516 --> 00:56:14,927
It has to be done.

627
00:56:15,476 --> 00:56:17,385
It's God's will.
Come on,

628
00:56:17,562 --> 00:56:19,720
do it like I showed you...
the neck first, Fenton!

629
00:56:33,869 --> 00:56:36,158
Fenton, get back here!

630
00:56:36,663 --> 00:56:37,659
Boy!

631
00:56:38,874 --> 00:56:40,119
Fenton!

632
00:56:48,466 --> 00:56:52,844
I half expected angels or God to
come out of the night and stop me.

633
00:56:54,305 --> 00:56:55,883
But I had to do it.

634
00:56:56,891 --> 00:56:58,220
It had to end.

635
00:57:10,488 --> 00:57:12,610
-Hello?
-1034 to any and all units

636
00:57:12,781 --> 00:57:14,157
in the vicinity of Garden.

637
00:57:14,325 --> 00:57:17,943
We have complaints of a 501 driving
on the alternate side of the street.

638
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:24,162
Hello?

639
00:57:24,751 --> 00:57:26,032
Hello?

640
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:34,173
Take it easy, boys.
Don't break my door down.

641
00:57:34,928 --> 00:57:36,470
Well, what's your problem?

642
00:57:38,223 --> 00:57:40,381
Craziest thing
I've heard in a long time.

643
00:57:40,683 --> 00:57:42,225
-What are you doing?
-Calling your dad.

644
00:57:42,393 --> 00:57:44,386
-You can't.
-Yes, I can. You ought to be ashamed

645
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:48,263
-making up stories like that.
-But, it's true! I can show you!

646
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:53,983
Come on.

647
00:57:54,488 --> 00:57:55,484
Let's go.

648
00:58:09,544 --> 00:58:13,293
-It's around back, under the shed.
-That's enough of that now, boy.

649
00:58:14,216 --> 00:58:17,964
-I'll put an end to this. Come on.
-No... he's around back.

650
00:58:18,386 --> 00:58:21,056
See what your dad's got
to say about all this.

651
00:58:29,856 --> 00:58:30,970
What's the trouble, sheriff?

652
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:34,901
Sorry to wake you, but your boy

653
00:58:35,069 --> 00:58:36,314
here seems to have a problem.

654
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:42,857
Come on in.

655
00:58:55,213 --> 00:58:59,591
I was about to head over to Lake
Thompson, to get a jump on the bass.

656
00:59:00,552 --> 00:59:03,257
And he comes running in
with this wild story.

657
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:07,381
-Yep. It's quite a tale all right.
-It's the truth and you know it.

658
00:59:10,186 --> 00:59:12,013
It makes me mad to think that he

659
00:59:12,814 --> 00:59:15,102
told everyone down
at your office too.

660
00:59:15,525 --> 00:59:19,107
You can set your mind at ease about
that. I was the only one there.

661
00:59:19,445 --> 00:59:21,319
Course, I don't believe
a word of it.

662
00:59:22,865 --> 00:59:24,324
What does get me,
though, is why would he

663
00:59:24,492 --> 00:59:26,484
make up such a crazy story?

664
00:59:30,122 --> 00:59:31,949
I don't know why he made it up.

665
00:59:34,168 --> 00:59:37,702
Probably did it to get back at me
for punishing him earlier.

666
00:59:39,214 --> 00:59:40,590
Did you tell him about that?

667
00:59:40,757 --> 00:59:42,797
He's lying.
Just check the shed.

668
00:59:45,887 --> 00:59:47,429
I don't know what to do with him.

669
00:59:49,015 --> 00:59:52,431
Well, they hit puberty, seem
to lose all respect for you.

670
00:59:53,269 --> 00:59:55,595
Me and my boys survived it.
You will too.

671
00:59:56,481 --> 01:00:00,181
Just check the shed or the rose
garden. I could show you where

672
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:04,730
-they're buried.
-Why don't you just quit all this?

673
01:00:04,906 --> 01:00:06,863
Please, I can show you.

674
01:00:12,705 --> 01:00:16,370
Maybe we ought to check
the shed just to quiet him down.

675
01:00:17,668 --> 01:00:20,159
Well, if it has to be done,
it has to be done.

676
01:00:22,297 --> 01:00:23,412
What do you think, kiddo?

677
01:00:26,176 --> 01:00:27,718
Does it have to be done?

678
01:00:44,777 --> 01:00:45,726
See?

679
01:00:47,113 --> 01:00:50,897
I figured we ought to have a storm
cellar. Goon down and check it out.

680
01:00:51,075 --> 01:00:53,827
Just watch your step.
I'm not much of a carpenter.

681
01:01:22,981 --> 01:01:24,689
I don't see a thing.

682
01:01:26,067 --> 01:01:27,561
He was here.

683
01:01:28,153 --> 01:01:32,565
You realize the trouble you could
get into over a thing like this?

684
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,822
They must have moved him
because he was here.

685
01:01:37,203 --> 01:01:39,908
Adam. Adam's got him
somewhere, I know it.

686
01:01:40,915 --> 01:01:43,620
-I think I've seen enough.
-But...

687
01:01:44,794 --> 01:01:46,288
I could show you where
the bodies are buried.

688
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:57,755
Please!
You gotta believe me!

689
01:02:28,669 --> 01:02:30,329
May God welcome you

690
01:02:32,131 --> 01:02:33,506
and keep you.

691
01:02:53,026 --> 01:02:55,315
I never killed
a man before tonight.

692
01:02:56,571 --> 01:02:57,769
I've seen you kill plenty.

693
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,696
Those were demons.
That was a man.

694
01:03:01,826 --> 01:03:03,534
Why can't you see that?

695
01:03:03,786 --> 01:03:06,657
-You didn't have to kill him.
-I had to protect our mission.

696
01:03:06,789 --> 01:03:08,497
There is no mission!

697
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:11,289
That man is dead because of you.

698
01:03:12,003 --> 01:03:13,746
You see him?
Look at him!

699
01:03:14,088 --> 01:03:16,413
He's dead because
you have no faith.

700
01:03:17,133 --> 01:03:18,757
Do you understand
what you made me do?

701
01:03:18,884 --> 01:03:22,051
-You made me commit murder!
-I didn't make you do anything!

702
01:03:22,221 --> 01:03:23,845
You did!
You're crazy!

703
01:03:24,014 --> 01:03:25,508
Shut up!
You're scared!

704
01:03:25,682 --> 01:03:28,636
Dad, no!
Dad, don't!

705
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:32,975
l... I can't.

706
01:03:38,862 --> 01:03:40,689
It's all right, Dad.

707
01:03:40,822 --> 01:03:42,102
Don't cry.

708
01:04:07,056 --> 01:04:08,431
Wait a minute, Fenton.

709
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:12,720
Go on inside, son. I'll be there
in a minute to tuck you in.

710
01:04:13,812 --> 01:04:15,010
Goon, it's all right.

711
01:04:15,397 --> 01:04:16,476
Go.

712
01:04:22,654 --> 01:04:24,029
Come into the shed.

713
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:42,539
Come in and shut the door.

714
01:04:52,558 --> 01:04:54,017
Are you afraid?

715
01:04:55,102 --> 01:04:57,178
-Of what?
-You.

716
01:04:59,314 --> 01:05:01,556
Only demons should fear me.

717
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:04,441
And you're not
a demon, are you?

718
01:05:06,905 --> 01:05:08,150
The angel said you were.

719
01:05:11,242 --> 01:05:14,113
But I can't believe that.
I won't.

720
01:05:18,124 --> 01:05:19,499
You're my son.

721
01:05:20,251 --> 01:05:22,707
And I love you more
than my own life.

722
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:28,003
You know what's funny
about all this, Fenton?

723
01:05:30,845 --> 01:05:32,636
I'm afraid of you.

724
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:57,359
Go on.

725
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,908
-But, Dad.
-I don't want to do this, Fenton,

726
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,666
but I have to.

727
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,744
I had to kill a man tonight.
I can't let that happen again.

728
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,211
But, Dad,
I promise I won't tell.

729
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:13,633
I can't trust you.
I wish I could.

730
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,001
Now goon.

731
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,587
But, Dad, I'm sorry.

732
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:24,183
I'm sorry too but this has to be
done. Now you get on down there

733
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:27,059
or I'll put you
down there myself.

734
01:06:27,232 --> 01:06:28,774
-But, Dad...
-Go!

735
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:31,231
No!

736
01:06:34,072 --> 01:06:36,444
No! No!

737
01:06:38,994 --> 01:06:41,401
Dad, please!
Dad! Dad! No, please!

738
01:06:43,081 --> 01:06:46,746
-No! Please, Dad!
-You'll stay till you see the truth.

739
01:06:46,918 --> 01:06:50,121
-Please, Dad, don't! Please, no!
-Pray to God, Fenton.

740
01:06:50,296 --> 01:06:54,128
-Please, no!
-Only He can help you now.

741
01:06:55,093 --> 01:06:58,010
Please, don't
do this, Dad! No!

742
01:06:58,262 --> 01:07:01,596
Please! Please,
it's me, Fenton, okay?

743
01:07:01,766 --> 01:07:03,924
Please don't do this.

744
01:07:05,227 --> 01:07:09,604
It's me. It's me, Fenton.
I'm not a demon! Please!

745
01:07:10,149 --> 01:07:12,272
Please, please!

746
01:07:13,861 --> 01:07:16,268
Please, no! Please!

747
01:07:17,698 --> 01:07:20,153
Please, don't do this.

748
01:07:20,784 --> 01:07:25,742
No! No! No, please, Dad!

749
01:07:42,638 --> 01:07:43,670
Fenton?

750
01:07:45,391 --> 01:07:46,636
Fenton!

751
01:07:48,811 --> 01:07:50,435
Fenton, you all right?

752
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,511
Adam?

753
01:07:53,524 --> 01:07:55,351
Adam, is that you?

754
01:08:00,948 --> 01:08:01,778
Adam?

755
01:08:02,783 --> 01:08:04,692
Adam, you gotta
get me out of here.

756
01:08:05,077 --> 01:08:06,239
I can't.

757
01:08:06,495 --> 01:08:09,614
But I'm hungry
and I gotta go to the bathroom.

758
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:11,699
Dad won't let me feed you.

759
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:14,119
I brought you
some water though.

760
01:08:14,377 --> 01:08:16,204
He says you can
have a cup a day.

761
01:08:16,588 --> 01:08:18,580
But I'll bring you
more if I can.

762
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:23,384
Look, Adam, he's gonna kill me.
You gotta get me out of here.

763
01:08:23,553 --> 01:08:25,011
I can't.

764
01:08:25,138 --> 01:08:27,130
Put your mouth
to the knothole right here.

765
01:08:29,308 --> 01:08:30,684
You ready?

766
01:08:30,851 --> 01:08:31,931
Here.

767
01:08:41,487 --> 01:08:43,444
You want some more
or you want me to save it

768
01:08:43,614 --> 01:08:47,196
-for later?
-More! More!

769
01:08:58,044 --> 01:09:00,749
-You've gotta get me out of here.
-Dad says

770
01:09:00,922 --> 01:09:02,879
you'll probably be out
of there by the end of the week.

771
01:09:03,049 --> 01:09:05,338
You just have
To accept God's will.

772
01:09:05,844 --> 01:09:07,421
A week?
I can't stay

773
01:09:07,595 --> 01:09:09,754
-in here that long.
-I'll pray for you.

774
01:09:10,807 --> 01:09:11,672
Adam?

775
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:14,134
Adam? Adam?

776
01:09:26,822 --> 01:09:28,696
The days came and went.

777
01:09:30,701 --> 01:09:35,528
I counted them by the light through
the hatch door and Adam's visits.

778
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:39,495
I only slept when
I passed out from exhaustion.

779
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:42,335
What about your dad?

780
01:09:42,754 --> 01:09:45,162
Didn't he ever come back
To at least check on you?

781
01:09:45,757 --> 01:09:47,335
On the seventh day.

782
01:09:57,268 --> 01:09:59,095
Has God spoken to you yet?

783
01:10:02,982 --> 01:10:04,809
There is no God.

784
01:10:19,498 --> 01:10:24,041
I lost count of the days
after that. It felt like weeks.

785
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:28,835
I finally went beyond fear
into total insanity.

786
01:10:31,134 --> 01:10:32,712
I saw God.

787
01:10:33,553 --> 01:10:35,759
He had finally
sent me a vision.

788
01:10:36,389 --> 01:10:39,924
It was then that I understood my
destiny just like Dad said I would.

789
01:10:43,604 --> 01:10:46,475
Dad! Fenton's not answering!

790
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:51,064
Fenton? Fenton?

791
01:11:03,582 --> 01:11:04,578
Fenton!

792
01:11:06,043 --> 01:11:07,157
Fenton.

793
01:11:08,587 --> 01:11:10,745
What? Come on, kiddo.

794
01:11:11,757 --> 01:11:13,132
Give me that water.

795
01:11:18,346 --> 01:11:19,544
Easy, boy.

796
01:11:19,764 --> 01:11:21,556
Easy. Easy.

797
01:11:22,517 --> 01:11:24,011
Here you go, kiddo.

798
01:11:24,227 --> 01:11:25,507
Here you go, buddy.

799
01:11:27,563 --> 01:11:28,726
Dad?

800
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:31,683
I saw God!

801
01:11:36,947 --> 01:11:38,607
Just try to take a little sip.

802
01:11:50,169 --> 01:11:53,620
Slow down there. Don't want to eat
too fast, you'll make yourself sick.

803
01:11:53,839 --> 01:11:56,127
So did God
tell you about the demons?

804
01:11:57,342 --> 01:11:59,418
Sorry I ever doubted you.

805
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,547
I'm sorry too, son.

806
01:12:03,682 --> 01:12:04,927
What did God look like?

807
01:12:05,683 --> 01:12:08,139
-Kind of hard to describe.
-Was He big?

808
01:12:08,311 --> 01:12:09,342
Adam,

809
01:12:09,687 --> 01:12:13,352
let your brother eat in peace.
He can't explain something

810
01:12:13,524 --> 01:12:15,600
-like that.
-But I want to know.

811
01:12:15,777 --> 01:12:18,528
-Then maybe you should pray for it.
-It's not fair.

812
01:12:18,696 --> 01:12:21,021
All I've ever seen are demons,
and he gets to see God.

813
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:24,532
That's right. But look at
the price he paid.

814
01:12:27,329 --> 01:12:28,740
That's all behind us now.

815
01:12:29,915 --> 01:12:32,121
It's a new day.
Isn't it, Fenton?

816
01:12:34,169 --> 01:12:35,450
So we gonna go
get us a demon now?

817
01:12:35,629 --> 01:12:39,579
After a while.
When Fenton's ready.

818
01:12:46,681 --> 01:12:48,473
A week later I was ready.

819
01:12:50,477 --> 01:12:53,596
My first demon was to be
Brad White from Dallas.

820
01:12:55,607 --> 01:12:57,765
-There it is.
-I see it.

821
01:13:16,752 --> 01:13:18,460
You're sure
you're ready for this?

822
01:13:19,421 --> 01:13:20,796
Yes, sir.

823
01:13:26,136 --> 01:13:30,679
I bought these for you. You'll need
them now that God has spoken to you.

824
01:13:36,855 --> 01:13:38,847
-All right, let's go.
-I want to go too, Dad.

825
01:13:39,023 --> 01:13:43,484
Not this time, Adam. You stay
here and keep your eyes peeled.

826
01:13:43,736 --> 01:13:46,406
Don't worry.
Your time will come.

827
01:13:49,867 --> 01:13:50,982
Let's go.

828
01:14:28,154 --> 01:14:29,862
-Sorry to bother you but...
-Yeah?

829
01:14:30,114 --> 01:14:32,356
My mom and I, we got
a flat on our van.

830
01:14:34,368 --> 01:14:36,160
-Yeah.
-Well, I was wondering if you had

831
01:14:36,329 --> 01:14:38,867
a tire iron. We went off
and left ours at home.

832
01:14:39,915 --> 01:14:41,742
Hey, pal, what's
with the gloves?

833
01:14:42,168 --> 01:14:44,456
Oh, to change the tire.

834
01:14:45,462 --> 01:14:47,538
-Don't want to get your hands dirty?
-Yeah.

835
01:14:47,715 --> 01:14:49,506
Brad, who is it?

836
01:14:49,717 --> 01:14:51,923
Mind your business,
you fucking bitch!

837
01:14:54,471 --> 01:14:56,131
Goddamn women.

838
01:15:00,018 --> 01:15:02,972
Yeah, I think
I got one for you.

839
01:15:04,314 --> 01:15:06,472
-Out back.
-Great.

840
01:15:11,446 --> 01:15:12,644
Back here.

841
01:15:23,457 --> 01:15:24,786
Let's see.

842
01:15:29,588 --> 01:15:30,751
Here it is.

843
01:15:36,345 --> 01:15:37,376
Shit!

844
01:15:42,893 --> 01:15:44,470
Grab his legs.

845
01:16:14,381 --> 01:16:15,544
Brad White?

846
01:16:24,057 --> 01:16:25,255
You know, Fenton,

847
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,133
I've been waiting for this moment
ever since all this started.

848
01:16:32,649 --> 01:16:34,974
I'm ready to fulfill
my destiny.

849
01:16:37,404 --> 01:16:38,898
I'm proud of you, son.

850
01:16:49,832 --> 01:16:51,161
Fuck you!

851
01:16:51,959 --> 01:16:53,204
You fuck!

852
01:16:53,586 --> 01:16:56,871
Get your fucking hands away!
Get the fuck off!

853
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:19,985
Destroy him!

854
01:17:50,391 --> 01:17:51,422
Dad!

855
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:01,101
Dad, no, no, no!

856
01:18:53,410 --> 01:18:54,405
No!

857
01:19:09,383 --> 01:19:11,376
I buried him
in the rose garden.

858
01:19:14,805 --> 01:19:16,549
We went to the sheriff's

859
01:19:17,558 --> 01:19:19,847
office a week later
and told them

860
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:24,518
that Dad just didn't
come home one day.

861
01:19:27,401 --> 01:19:30,900
They filed a missing persons
but they didn't find anything.

862
01:19:34,574 --> 01:19:37,326
After a while they sent us
to separate orphanages.

863
01:19:38,578 --> 01:19:39,492
So,

864
01:19:40,747 --> 01:19:42,740
nobody ever knew
about any of this?

865
01:19:42,999 --> 01:19:44,030
No.

866
01:19:47,003 --> 01:19:48,462
Not until now.

867
01:19:51,341 --> 01:19:53,380
What about Adam?
He didn't tell anybody?

868
01:19:59,473 --> 01:20:03,138
Mind if we just sit here? I don't
much feel like talking anymore.

869
01:21:15,463 --> 01:21:18,334
Tell me more about that promise
you made to your brother.

870
01:21:23,179 --> 01:21:24,721
It was later on that night.

871
01:21:58,963 --> 01:21:59,995
Adam?

872
01:22:02,926 --> 01:22:04,883
If you ever destroy me,

873
01:22:05,428 --> 01:22:07,504
promise me you'll bury me here.

874
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:11,262
I promise to God
I'll bury you here.

875
01:22:22,736 --> 01:22:23,899
I don't get it.

876
01:22:25,489 --> 01:22:28,443
He promised you that
he'd bury you here?

877
01:22:29,118 --> 01:22:30,197
Yeah.

878
01:22:30,577 --> 01:22:32,071
If he killed you.

879
01:22:32,246 --> 01:22:34,950
No, not killed. Destroyed.

880
01:22:35,832 --> 01:22:37,326
Don't make any sense.

881
01:22:40,128 --> 01:22:41,373
Yes, it does.

882
01:22:46,593 --> 01:22:49,166
If that man standing
in front of you is Adam Meiks.

883
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:10,272
So you killed all those people.

884
01:23:12,368 --> 01:23:15,867
No. No, I told you before, I've
never killed anyone in my life.

885
01:23:16,872 --> 01:23:18,247
Fenton was the killer.

886
01:23:18,415 --> 01:23:20,787
Just stop the bullshit
and tell me the truth.

887
01:23:21,626 --> 01:23:23,286
You'll understand soon.

888
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:26,292
Just let me show you
where I buried Fenton.

889
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:27,704
Hold it.

890
01:23:31,094 --> 01:23:32,754
You take it real slow.

891
01:24:05,127 --> 01:24:06,502
That's it.

892
01:24:09,589 --> 01:24:10,965
This is the spot.

893
01:24:16,763 --> 01:24:18,554
There's too many graves here.

894
01:24:18,723 --> 01:24:21,179
There's only six victims.

895
01:24:25,396 --> 01:24:27,519
Fenton didn't bury
his victims here.

896
01:24:28,357 --> 01:24:29,935
He kept them as trophies
in his basement.

897
01:24:33,779 --> 01:24:35,190
This is where I put demons.

898
01:24:38,993 --> 01:24:40,736
You thought
your brother was a demon?

899
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:42,949
He was.

900
01:24:46,834 --> 01:24:48,826
That's why he couldn't
see the truth.

901
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:53,953
Dad knew it too.
He just couldn't accept it.

902
01:24:57,093 --> 01:24:59,845
You see, God asked Dad
To destroy his son,

903
01:24:59,971 --> 01:25:03,174
much like He asked Abraham
to sacrifice his son Isaac.

904
01:25:05,101 --> 01:25:06,679
But Dad couldn't do it.

905
01:25:08,563 --> 01:25:11,232
And God didn't take pity
on Dad like He did Abraham.

906
01:25:18,281 --> 01:25:20,522
So He handed down
The duty to me.

907
01:25:23,661 --> 01:25:27,705
Fenton knew I'd come. That's why
he left those notes to lure me in.

908
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,999
I guess he figured when the killings
made the news that I'd come for him.

909
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:37,912
But I had to wait
till God put him on my list.

910
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:41,876
To come before that
would have been murder.

911
01:26:33,561 --> 01:26:34,641
Adam?

912
01:26:49,952 --> 01:26:53,238
Jesus Christ, you really
do believe all this stuff.

913
01:26:54,748 --> 01:26:56,492
I've always believed.

914
01:27:01,547 --> 01:27:03,124
That's all lies, Adam.

915
01:27:03,966 --> 01:27:05,792
No, it's not. I see it
when he touches them.

916
01:27:45,172 --> 01:27:46,750
You're just crazy as hell.

917
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:51,168
Fenton or Adam
or whatever your damn name is.

918
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,673
I don't really give a fuck.

919
01:27:57,684 --> 01:27:59,890
All I need to know right now

920
01:28:00,979 --> 01:28:03,684
is you're a murdering
son of a bitch.

921
01:28:04,774 --> 01:28:06,185
And I got you.

922
01:28:08,069 --> 01:28:09,018
Maybe.

923
01:28:11,489 --> 01:28:13,695
But that's not gonna bring
your mother back, is it?

924
01:28:16,452 --> 01:28:17,781
She's dead

925
01:28:18,454 --> 01:28:20,992
and her killer
got away, didn't he?

926
01:28:24,085 --> 01:28:25,828
Goddamn you.
Dirty little son of a...

927
01:28:50,026 --> 01:28:51,485
How did you know?

928
01:28:52,821 --> 01:28:54,481
You were on my list.

929
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:18,960
You didn't think anybody
knew about that, did you?

930
01:29:20,305 --> 01:29:23,342
God knew.
That's why he sent me.

931
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:51,621
I'm an FBI agent.

932
01:29:53,587 --> 01:29:55,663
They'll come looking for me.

933
01:29:57,341 --> 01:29:58,539
No, they won't.

934
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:02,003
They'll keep
looking for Fenton.

935
01:30:04,431 --> 01:30:06,305
You're going to be
his last victim.

936
01:30:07,893 --> 01:30:09,387
They've seen you.

937
01:30:11,396 --> 01:30:12,772
They'll know it was you.

938
01:30:23,867 --> 01:30:25,444
God will protect me.

939
01:30:42,968 --> 01:30:45,638
I can't talk right now, I can't.
I'll get back to you.

940
01:30:46,388 --> 01:30:47,764
-Here.
-Thank you.

941
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,723
Are you sure neither one of you
can remember what he looks like?

942
01:30:51,894 --> 01:30:53,720
Look, I told you
it's just a blur.

943
01:30:54,396 --> 01:30:57,516
I can't understand it. I looked
right at him. I shook his hand.

944
01:30:58,025 --> 01:31:01,524
Dave, we've got a problem.
You've got to take a look at this.

945
01:31:06,157 --> 01:31:07,106
There he is.

946
01:31:08,827 --> 01:31:10,653
We got you now, buddy.

947
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:15,830
-What is this?
-All the tapes look like this.

948
01:31:17,126 --> 01:31:18,668
Goddamn it!

949
01:31:19,962 --> 01:31:23,212
-We're running the name he gave you.
-It's got to be a fake name.

950
01:31:23,382 --> 01:31:26,965
Sounds fake. Fenton Meiks.

951
01:31:27,511 --> 01:31:31,924
Fenton Meiks, this is the FBI!
We're coming in! Go! Go!

952
01:31:36,353 --> 01:31:37,384
Clear!

953
01:31:50,575 --> 01:31:52,117
-Anything?
-No.

954
01:31:52,285 --> 01:31:53,744
All right, let's dust it.

955
01:31:59,584 --> 01:32:01,126
Oh, my God.

956
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:06,374
There's no one here, sir.

957
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,543
We found this
in the basement.

958
01:32:14,807 --> 01:32:16,135
Is he down there too?

959
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:19,223
Not him.

960
01:32:31,782 --> 01:32:34,617
1034, possible 1070...

961
01:32:38,455 --> 01:32:39,783
Excuse me.

962
01:32:40,665 --> 01:32:43,037
Didn't hear you come in.
How can I help you?

963
01:32:43,168 --> 01:32:45,409
I'm with the FBI. I need to speak
to the sheriff. Is he in?

964
01:32:46,337 --> 01:32:48,081
Sure thing.
Sheriff?

965
01:32:49,841 --> 01:32:52,841
-Would you like some coffee?
-No, I'm fine, thanks.

966
01:32:57,181 --> 01:32:59,802
-Well, hey, Curtis.
-Afternoon, Becky.

967
01:33:11,695 --> 01:33:12,644
Sheriff?

968
01:33:12,821 --> 01:33:13,734
Yeah.

969
01:33:17,284 --> 01:33:19,027
I'm agent Griffin Hull of the FBI.

970
01:33:19,161 --> 01:33:21,200
I need to ask you
Some questions about your brother.

971
01:33:23,665 --> 01:33:24,827
Fenton?

972
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,114
Yes, sir.

973
01:33:30,964 --> 01:33:32,374
Why don't you
come on around back?

974
01:33:39,722 --> 01:33:42,130
Well, I appreciate you coming by
to tell me personally.

975
01:33:42,266 --> 01:33:44,971
I just wanted you to know
before we go public.

976
01:33:46,353 --> 01:33:49,271
Well, listen, if there's anything
I can do, don't hesitate to call.

977
01:33:49,481 --> 01:33:51,474
I think we got it
pretty well covered from here.

978
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:54,853
But again, if you can think of
anything, or if he contacts you...

979
01:33:55,028 --> 01:33:56,855
-Of course.
-All right.

980
01:34:01,326 --> 01:34:02,868
You're a good man, Agent Hull.

981
01:34:41,406 --> 01:34:43,280
Everything okay, Adam?

982
01:34:45,327 --> 01:34:47,403
Everything's just fine, Becky.

983
01:34:48,747 --> 01:34:50,905
God's will has been served.

984
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,708
Praise God.
