1
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,910
Oh boy, my fears...

2
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,396
Well, let's see. I never really
was comfortable with being alone.

3
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,030
<i>Then all those other girls,</i>
<i>they were so jealous of the fact</i>

4
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,589
<i>that they had to worry about</i>
<i>what they wore at school.</i>

5
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,591
<i>As if their parents cared.</i>

6
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,839
<i>When you're in the public eye,</i>
<i>beauty rules. You ladies know that.</i>

7
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,908
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

8
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,594
<i>There is definitely</i>
<i>no "mister right."</i>

9
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,909
<i>And I sort of...</i>

10
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,152
wanted that attention.
But you know, from my Dad...

11
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,711
<i>Not my real dad, he died,</i>
<i>but my stepfather.</i>

12
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,390
<i>But I wasn't quite sure</i>
<i>how to get it but...</i>

13
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,953
<i>I was passive, you know, and</i>
<i>I think that's my worst nightmare.</i>

14
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,390
<i>Being passive, so yeah...</i>

15
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,237
<i>I was a rebel in high school.</i>

16
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,712
<i>Always had like a little bra-strap</i>
<i>showing. The black lipstick. God...</i>

17
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,357
<i>I liked the attention walking down</i>
<i>the sidewalk, all those eyes on me.</i>

18
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,559
<i>But if a guy tried to talk to me,</i>
<i>I was like whoa... so out of there.</i>

19
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,237
I can't help it
if people are hooked on beauty.

20
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,478
<i>Ever since my dad died, my real dad.</i>
<i>I either sleep with the TV on,</i>

21
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,669
<i>or the lights on.</i>

22
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,550
<i>Sometimes I tell myself stories.</i>
<i>That kind of stuff. I hate the dark.</i>

23
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,757
Where am I?

24
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,036
Please! Please!

25
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,759
My apartment?

26
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,189
No.

27
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,390
How did you get in my apartment?
Let me outta here, you fuck!

28
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,909
You bastard!

29
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,157
You don't know who I am!

30
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,716
You won't get away with this!
There'll be police all over this!

31
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,710
You just entered a shit storm!

32
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,430
This guy went
all over the fuckin' place.

33
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,031
And there's no prints either.
Not even a fuckin' eyebrow here.

34
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,712
So I spoke to Miss Tree's father.
Didn't sound surprised at all.

35
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,388
She said she left home
when she was 15.

36
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,399
Mother lives in Paris.

37
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,108
- You got everything you need now?
- Yeah, I guess.

38
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,674
All right, John, bring it up.

39
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,119
Okay, we're done here.

40
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,798
Bettiger, come here for a second.

41
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,796
What are you doing?

42
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,637
It's Greek. It says...

43
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,631
- How do you know it's Greek?
- Because I read Greek.

44
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,949
You read Greek?

45
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,878
Yeah, I read Greek.

46
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,315
Okay. What does it mean?

47
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,188
It means, "reflect...

48
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,592
this dust that once knew fear."

49
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,676
So what, you've got me.
So what?

50
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,468
<i>There is definitely</i>
<i>no "mister right".</i>

51
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,191
<i>My parents weren't in line when</i>
<i>the love gene was being passed out.</i>

52
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,509
Yeah? I understand.
Yup. You got it, Chief.

53
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,789
Yes.

54
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,672
Okay. Okay, that's it. That's...
you hang in there, sweetie. Bye.

55
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,835
Sweetie, huh?

56
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,117
Mayor's bustin' his chops.

57
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,468
I want you to meet my new partner.
Ray "The Greek" Disantos.

58
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,920
Evidence of bone and tissue.
Yup, got it. Ten-four.

59
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,630
So the missing girl
is a movie star?

60
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,360
Model, hot... Latest thing.

61
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,192
So that was Wade in Forensics.

62
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,668
The ash in the salt cellar,

63
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,594
the DNA matched last year's victim.
Mary Deavro.

64
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,276
Oh, Mary. This kid was
a national cheerleader champ.

65
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,836
Me and you will inform
the parents personally.

66
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,553
'Cause I knew her.
Let them down easy.

67
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,839
All right.

68
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,155
So what do you guys make
of the victims? A pattern?

69
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,392
- Random.
- I don't buy it.

70
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,117
This guy doesn't do
anything without purpose.

71
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,028
Without precision.

72
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,393
Sex, torture, killing...
that's all the bonus.

73
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,957
It's the control.
That's what winds his clock.

74
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,109
Captured.

75
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,909
Me too.

76
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,595
Two days.

77
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,276
Why?

78
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,795
Please!

79
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,869
Please! Please help me!

80
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,790
Help.

81
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,908
Matches.

82
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,870
There's only a few of these,
so we shouldn't waste them, okay?

83
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,914
We got to get out of here.

84
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,993
But this whole place is sealed
like some kind of wine cellar.

85
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,708
I tried going through
the vents, I got part

86
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,399
of the way, it was too narrow.

87
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,508
I got stuck.

88
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,388
Have you seen him?

89
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,238
No, he's been drugging me, I have
absolutely no fuckin' sense of time.

90
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,716
God, I know this might sound
incredibly selfish,

91
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,071
but right now
I'm thanking God I'm not alone.

92
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,115
You okay?

93
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,349
Hear that?

94
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,352
Oh, fuck you, motherfucker!

95
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,274
You think he's
been listening to us?

96
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,555
Gotta figure, yeah.

97
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,431
Assuming he is even a he.

98
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,071
Oh, trust me, he's a he.
Women don't do this kind of shit.

99
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,995
<i>You know that for a fact?</i>

100
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,395
<i>Yeah, I've been stalked.</i>

101
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,359
And I know creeps,
it comes with the job.

102
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,075
What exactly is your job?

103
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,509
Celebrity.

104
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,789
Are you telling me it's like
a big deal that you're gone?

105
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,474
Maybe, maybe not.
I've flaked out a couple of times.

106
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,031
<i>He knows all about me.</i>
<i>He's been in my apartment.</i>

107
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,231
<i>He's got books</i>
<i>and stuff from mine.</i>

108
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,830
<i>Yeah, he's got my clothes.</i>
<i>Everything else is easy.</i>

109
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,315
<i>Easy?</i>

110
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,990
<i>Every interviewer's asked me</i>
<i>anything you can imagine.</i>

111
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,116
<i>What are you afraid of...?</i>
<i>If you have to choose</i>

112
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,838
<i>between pink and orange...?</i>
<i>What's your idea of Hell?</i>

113
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,911
<i>You always give them the answers?</i>

114
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,918
It's flirtation, sometimes you tell
them the truth, sometimes you don't.

115
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,713
But even your idea of Hell?

116
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,956
I didn't tell them that.

117
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,315
<i>Let me guess.</i>

118
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,475
Isolation.

119
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,915
Damn it!

120
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,354
It's okay, look at me.

121
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,673
How did he get you?

122
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,318
I got suckered into going to this
charity event at a club in Soho.

123
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,515
Someone must've put
something in my drink.

124
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,675
That fucker...

125
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,119
<i>I needed some fresh air,</i>
<i>there was a hand on my shoulder,</i>

126
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,229
<i>leading me outside.</i>
<i>And then a damp cloth...</i>

127
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,559
The last thing
I remember was thinking

128
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,836
that I hope he's not smearing
my eye makeup all over.

129
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,035
And you?

130
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,875
I was driving from Nebraska
to Connecticut. I got tired,

131
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,437
so I pulled into a truck stop.
I woke up,

132
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,552
'cause I thought I heard
the sound of someone crying.

133
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,078
I got out to see what the hell
was going on. And then, wham...

134
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,909
You see that?

135
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,714
Last thing I remember...

136
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,469
was the smell of french fries from
the all-night diner at the stop.

137
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,435
You...

138
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,915
Here you go.

139
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,993
Coffee's lukewarm. What were you
doing, consulting a psychic?

140
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,913
I was gettin' my Mac on brother...

141
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,075
Mac on...

142
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,317
- Doin' my thing.
- What the fuck is this?

143
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,956
Did you fuck with my phone?

144
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,075
You need to take better care
of your toys, man.

145
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,915
Yeah, Chief.

146
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,753
<i>Hey, did you get shit about</i>
<i>that model? What's her name?</i>

147
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,636
Miss Tree.

148
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,553
<i>Check on everybody from</i>
<i>the club, guests and staff...</i>

149
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,676
Yeah, I appreciate that, but
there were 700 people in that club.

150
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,677
<i>And?</i>

151
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,956
I've got 3 teams on it.
We're making progress.

152
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,679
<i>Don't forget the caterers.</i>
<i>Get back to me.</i>

153
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,636
You got it.

154
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,638
- I know what the footprints mean.
- Yeah, why don't you enlighten me?

155
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,118
Think of a story.

156
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,153
You're on a beach. In Hawaii.

157
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,275
Oh yeah, the water's blue.

158
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,471
If you're in here...

159
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,314
what do you want?

160
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,474
<i>I knew you were going</i>
<i>to do this to me too.</i>

161
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,914
<i>You know I've never been...</i>

162
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,316
<i>comfortable with the dark.</i>
<i>I don't like being in the dark.</i>

163
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,035
<i>It's always been a phobia.</i>

164
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,030
<i>When you go on Safari, just nature</i>
<i>is so awesome, don't you think?</i>

165
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,716
<i>It was sort of scary too at the</i>
<i>same time, even though I loved it.</i>

166
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,388
<i>All that space</i>
<i>just freaked me out.</i>

167
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,549
Here.

168
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,999
Is this what you want?

169
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,750
Gary.

170
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,708
Are you okay?

171
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,595
Yeah...

172
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,678
He cut my hair.
Why would he do that?

173
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,868
He's cleaning things up, he comes
in when he wants to and checks us.

174
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,717
Was he taking blood samples?

175
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,840
<i>Hey, you listening to me,</i>
<i>wherever you are!</i>

176
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,118
<i>What's the point</i>
<i>of antagonizing him?</i>

177
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,514
<i>You got a better idea?</i>

178
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,949
<i>Let's give this guy a show!</i>
<i>Whatever he wants!</i>

179
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,949
Whatever the fuck that is!

180
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,993
Why take blood samples
and cut my hair off?

181
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,152
I don't know, for a DNA maybe.

182
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,630
DNA, what does he
want to do, clone us?

183
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,716
He's a mad scientist,
how would I know?

184
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,189
Forget it,
this isn't going anywhere.

185
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,273
So what do you do?

186
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,991
When you're not
trapped in a wine cellar.

187
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,233
I sleep in other people's cars.

188
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,033
When people want...
to drive their cars

189
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,350
from one coast to the other, but
they don't have the time to drive,

190
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,951
they use me.
I have the time. I drive.

191
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,269
It's a job.

192
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,231
It is?

193
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,437
Excuse me, if celebrity is a job,
so is driving another person's car.

194
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,837
I get why I was kidnapped.

195
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,270
You have a value,
and I don't?

196
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,676
I'm not saying that it's not
messed up, but the reality is...

197
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,471
Reality is without guys like me to
drive your cars, you'd be walking.

198
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,360
And if there wasn't guys
like me, there wouldn't be

199
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,590
anyone to pay guys
like you, would there?

200
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,513
You live in this little bubble
and you look down

201
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,239
on the people who
live in the real world.

202
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,669
You're so full of it.

203
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,788
What's it like,
living in a bubble?

204
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,155
Safe.

205
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,312
And I'm not...

206
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,554
full of it.

207
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,556
<i>And I'm not...</i>

208
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,836
<i>full of it.</i>

209
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,918
<i>And I'm not...</i>

210
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,994
<i>full of it.</i>

211
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,512
We figure this guy is using
sophisticated video equipment,

212
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,638
recorders, shit like that.
Run a check on all the local chains

213
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,196
and look for large purchases
by repeat customers.

214
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,076
All right, listen, I buy it.
He's making a video, but what for?

215
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,834
Will you get this thing
outta my face? Come on.

216
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,238
<i>He's using the video as a weapon</i>
<i>against her. What do we know so far?</i>

217
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,793
<i>He kills in April.</i>

218
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,991
He leaves the ashes
of his last victim

219
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,388
next to his current victim.

220
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,637
Along with a quote on a tarot card.

221
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,228
Locked in ritual.

222
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,752
Poetry on tarot cards.
In English, in Greek.

223
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,112
He's not giving you guys
any clues. He's fuckin' with you.

224
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,879
This type of killer

225
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,196
subconsciously wants to get caught.

226
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,470
That's the real reason
they go to the press, leave clues.

227
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,076
Our guy hasn't given us
anything concrete.

228
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,955
He's not ready.

229
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,915
Jesus Christ...

230
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,672
Unless you get lucky
or he screws up,

231
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,751
I'm afraid she's on her own.
Sorry.

232
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,398
<i>He lights a candle.</i>

233
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,951
We have a bottle of wine.
He's with me...

234
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,752
Holding me...

235
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,629
Warm clothes,

236
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,630
I'm not warm,
but I feel warm inside.

237
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,114
I feel him.

238
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,558
He brings the candle towards me.

239
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,154
The light... it gets brighter.

240
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,349
Brighter...

241
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,949
Help! Help me!

242
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,753
<i>Help!</i>

243
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,879
Don't you touch her!

244
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,838
You sick fuck!

245
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,268
Help!

246
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,236
Help! Please!

247
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,189
No! Help!

248
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,440
<i>No! Help!</i>

249
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,714
Help!

250
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,112
You're okay. It's okay.

251
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,509
Jennifer...

252
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,551
Take a breath.
Count to 4.

253
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,072
1, 2, 3, 4.

254
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,434
Good, and count to 4.

255
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,119
1, 2, 3, 4.

256
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,674
Motherfucker.

257
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,113
Keep breathing, okay.

258
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,395
I know.

259
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,595
Count to four. Keep breathing.

260
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,353
Keep counting, Jennifer.

261
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,034
1, 2, 3, 4.

262
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,989
Where are we?

263
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,832
Crawl space...

264
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,877
The ground floor of this house
is just above our heads, I think.

265
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,555
Come on.

266
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,193
<i>Why do bad things happen</i>
<i>to good people, you ask?</i>

267
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:45,150
<i>That's the mystery, Mary!</i>
<i>That's the mystery.</i>

268
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,475
Come on.

269
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,915
Battery's dead!

270
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,115
Pop the hood!

271
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,555
Fire it up!

272
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,875
Thank you.

273
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,833
Gary! Gary! Gary!

274
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,915
No!

275
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,435
No!

276
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,869
Damn it! No!

277
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,513
No! No!

278
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,955
What is this about, exactly?

279
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,557
I'd appreciate it if you'd wear
these gloves while you're in here.

280
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,308
It's a homicide investigation,
Mr. Dexter.

281
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,517
We got a lot of questions
we need answered. You understand?

282
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,514
Yeah, I grasp the basic concept
of the interview.

283
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,111
But you have to understand,
my records are confidential.

284
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,635
I'm very careful about that.

285
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,199
Leon!

286
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,355
Would you like to get them into
the truck before next Thursday?

287
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,513
Mr. Dexter. I want you to know
that I appreciate your position,

288
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,278
so let me tell you
how it's going to be.

289
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,992
You're going to call your lawyer and
I'm going to throw handcuffs on you.

290
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,431
We're going to go downtown, and have
a little get together down there.

291
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,799
Let me cuff this guy.

292
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,317
Barnett Freel has a criminal record,
according to his W2's, state taxes,

293
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,755
he works for you. When was
the last time you've seen him?

294
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,399
Barnett Freel...

295
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,395
Last in on... Tuesday.

296
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,832
Tuesday, you catered
Club Shine on Tuesday.

297
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,389
He work that event?

298
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,594
Yes, he would have left
after 1 a.m. Big event.

299
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:05,033
Correct me if I'm wrong but you pay
this guy Freel $1,200 a month.

300
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,798
So how is it that he spends
over $3,600 a month

301
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,797
on sophisticated
electronics equipment?

302
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:15,233
We live in an age of plastic?
What can I tell ya?

303
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,153
You got a current address on him?

304
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,231
Oh, it's Brooklyn Heights someplace,
let me check.

305
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,595
Thank you.

306
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,674
We're not getting
out of here, are we?

307
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,639
There's always a way out.

308
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,997
We just have to think
like him. Anticipate...

309
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,878
The way he anticipated us?

310
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,039
The wall's bullshit.

311
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,158
He's made it impossible
to get out of here,

312
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,069
but we can get through the vents,
I find the nail file,

313
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,909
the car...

314
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,712
He's playing with us.
Showing his power.

315
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,149
<i>We're still alive,</i>
<i>and as long as</i>

316
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,514
<i>we're still alive</i>
<i>we got to have hope.</i>

317
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,557
- <i>What for?</i>
- <i>You're not alone.</i>

318
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,832
<i>Please, who isn't alone?</i>
<i>I was alone when I was a kid,</i>

319
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,915
<i>I ran away from home 'cause I was</i>
<i>alone. And that's the way it works.</i>

320
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,196
<i>Leave him alone!</i>

321
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,474
<i>I can't do this.</i>

322
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,953
Imagine him with you.

323
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,639
Who?

324
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,239
Your lover.

325
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,398
I don't have one.

326
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,669
The one in your head.

327
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,513
He's with you.

328
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,752
He makes you feel safe.
How?

329
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,279
He lights a candle.

330
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,637
He wants you to be close to him.

331
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,474
You feel his touch.

332
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,715
Yes.

333
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,515
You feel his touch.
Now what does he do?

334
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,077
He comes closer.

335
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,472
You bring him closer.

336
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,194
And your eyes are shut
but you can see the light.

337
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,189
It's part of you.

338
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,078
In your fingers, strengthens you.

339
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:03,194
And the light is for real.

340
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,270
Yes.

341
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,238
All that you can see is flame.

342
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,153
<i>You're not alone.</i>

343
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,117
<i>You are in the light.</i>

344
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,269
<i>And you have no fear.</i>
<i>You're not alone.</i>

345
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,195
Fucker!

346
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,515
Fucker!

347
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,709
Fuck!

348
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,270
<i>When the doors open,</i>
<i>we didn't move.</i>

349
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,469
<i>I wanted to.</i>

350
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,914
<i>Yes.</i>

351
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,351
<i>I was afraid</i>
<i>that you weren't real.</i>

352
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,274
What's real?

353
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,074
What you can touch.

354
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,474
Key number 4.

355
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,589
This is it.

356
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,719
Don't.

357
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,915
Gary!

358
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,310
Come here!

359
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,673
What's real? Tell me again.

360
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,877
What you can touch.

361
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,556
Sick motherfucking freak!

362
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,349
You don't think I know!

363
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,357
- Gary!
- Come on.

364
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,154
<i>Don't!</i>

365
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,114
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

366
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,310
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

367
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,069
<i>No! Don't kill him!</i>

368
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,878
What do you want to hear!

369
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,074
Tell me what you want to hear!

370
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,313
Don't kill him!

371
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,833
Are you going to kill me?

372
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,715
Gary!

373
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,355
Gary!

374
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,191
- Gary?
- Jennifer...

375
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,194
Oh, thank God.

376
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,879
You begged for my life.

377
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,117
I felt like
I was paying for mine.

378
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,675
I can't stop staring at you.

379
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,791
I guess you get that
a lot though, huh?

380
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,996
Can't stop touching you.

381
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,759
Me neither.

382
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,915
Shit.

383
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,239
Do you believe this shit?

384
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,153
Yeah, hey, Susan.
We're at 1780 Carson.

385
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,556
And unless this guy lives in a
crate, we're at a bullshit address.

386
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,994
Shit?
Hey, look at this.

387
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,919
Hey, we got a great fuckin' view!
It's a great view!

388
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,671
So this is what
we're going to do...

389
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,799
Jennifer. Jen...

390
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,155
I'm tired.

391
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,395
Up on your feet.

392
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,915
I feel like I did 30 shots of Stoli.

393
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,309
Jennifer, talk to me.

394
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,835
I can't, just let me sleep.

395
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:12,756
Jenny, come on. Jennifer.
Can you hear me?

396
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,829
That fucker.

397
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,475
Oh, God...

398
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,515
Jennifer.

399
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,633
Was it good?

400
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,354
One of the best.

401
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,835
I thought you were going
to wait till morning.

402
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,758
Have another night of hero sex.

403
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,198
- Don't you ever want to be the one?
- The one...?

404
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,874
Experiencing it?

405
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,948
I do.

406
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,509
Always.

407
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,357
You're inside her,
I'm inside her.

408
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,429
Doesn't it ever get
predictable for you?

409
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,593
That's the point, predicting it.

410
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,638
I said it would be the fourth day.

411
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:44,112
It's the fourth day.
She worships you.

412
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,989
What if I don't want
to end this one?

413
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,432
You know the drill.

414
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,793
Last one didn't even last 3 days.

415
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,316
It's not like we've gotten
anything written in stone.

416
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,877
Hey, look at me.
No, no, look at me.

417
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:05,914
We do this now, while she's still
a smile on your little face.

418
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,592
Ben, I don't know about this girl.

419
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,398
I feel like
this could be the one...

420
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,158
You stop playing the game
before it starts playing you.

421
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,313
What do I always tell you?

422
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,113
- Play them...
- Not with them.

423
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,879
It wouldn't last,
things are what they are.

424
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,837
It's the tapes and the books
that make it better.

425
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,116
Make it last forever.

426
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,192
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

427
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,198
You got a good system,
you stick with it.

428
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,230
She wants me to be with her.

429
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,233
What about me?

430
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,433
You could do this without me.

431
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,794
Well, that wouldn't be
quite the same now, would it?

432
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,997
We have a pattern.

433
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:03,189
You can't change that,
even if we wanted to.

434
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,595
Death, that's where the buzz is.

435
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:16,036
The redemption.
The rest is preliminaries.

436
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,273
So get the plastic bags.

437
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:23,675
- Help me clean up.
- No.

438
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,993
I want to do it myself this time.

439
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,669
That I would like to see.

440
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,393
You don't believe I could do it?

441
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,635
This girl's special, Ben.

442
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,559
I feel like it's only right
that I should do it.

443
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,679
So you want to prove yourself,
little brother? Okay.

444
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:44,192
Okay. Just as well
we do it right now. Ready?

445
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,675
Yeah, I'm ready.

446
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:08,675
Hello?

447
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:09,955
Yes?

448
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,595
NYPD. Mr. Dexter?

449
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,952
Which Mr. Dexter do you want?

450
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,594
Benjamin Dexter.
Is he home?

451
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,595
Ah, no. I can
tell him you stopped by.

452
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,235
You are...?

453
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,113
I'm his brother.

454
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,799
Oh, like the truck says.

455
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,759
Dexter Brothers, right?

456
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,069
Yeah.

457
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,395
So you gonna open the door,
Mr. Dexter?

458
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,829
Knock off the hinges...

459
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,478
You two always lived together?

460
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,592
No. This was our parents' house.
My brother lives here.

461
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,114
That's a pretty bad cut
you got there, man.

462
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,309
All right?

463
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,549
Oh God, yeah, football...

464
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,239
Go ahead, you were saying?

465
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,514
I'm staying here a few days, while
my apartment is being refurnished.

466
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:09,836
Where would that be?

467
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,635
Queens.

468
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,551
Hey, your sink
doesn't work in there.

469
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,711
Yeah, I know, my brother
doesn't use this floor too much.

470
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,996
So you guys want
to tell me why you're here?

471
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,271
We're investigating
a missing person.

472
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,158
It's a woman.
Here's her picture.

473
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,719
Pretty girl.
How can I help?

474
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,600
We just need to check on everyone
that works for Dexter's Catering.

475
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:31,949
Two minutes, man.

476
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:34,270
Couple of questions
and we're outta here in no time.

477
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,636
Yeah, sure. Do you guys
want a drink or something?

478
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,792
Sure, you got any ice tea?

479
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,434
Yeah, I think I do.

480
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,119
- You?
- Anything.

481
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,992
Okay. Excuse me.

482
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,435
Take your time.

483
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,436
We thought we'd save you the trip.

484
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,595
Sure.

485
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,474
So then, you're not in the catering
business with your brother then?

486
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,631
Well I help him out once
and awhile when he's in a pinch.

487
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,518
Like Tuesday night?
Club Shine?

488
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,432
No, I wasn't there.

489
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,475
You weren't there at all?

490
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,795
Nope.

491
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,359
Okay. Here's my card.

492
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,834
- Thank you.
- Okay.

493
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,276
Oh, you know what,
the playoff game is on channel 9.

494
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,789
- It's the last quarter.
- That's right.

495
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,474
Do you mind if we check
the score real quick?

496
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:40,795
Channel 9?

497
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,235
Yeah.

498
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,358
That's great.

499
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,193
Maybe your brother will be back
by the time the game is over.

500
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:50,759
Hey, look at this, we're winning.

501
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:52,635
All right.

502
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:01,515
This roaches shit...

503
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,236
Get the fuck outta here.

504
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,199
Look at this fuckin' shit.

505
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,949
It's me, you got to wake up,
Jennifer. Jennifer.

506
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:29,709
You got to wake up, okay? Jennifer,
there's not much time, okay, honey?

507
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,228
You got to wake up, it's over.

508
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:32,595
Over...

509
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,715
It's over.

510
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:34,869
What's over?

511
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,155
This.

512
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,238
There's no one
to keep us here anymore.

513
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,515
How?

514
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,555
I killed them.

515
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,318
Them?

516
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,511
There was two of them.
I killed them.

517
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,675
Oh, my God!

518
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,916
They underestimated me. One of them
came in, I was ready for him.

519
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,394
And I got his gun.

520
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,199
Where are they?

521
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,718
They're upstairs. Come on.

522
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:02,908
They're really dead?

523
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,388
You strong enough to walk?

524
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,437
If you hold onto me...

525
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,308
Listen to me. I'm not
letting go of you. Not ever.

526
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,394
Where are we?

527
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,437
This is some old house.
I haven't been outside.

528
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,679
Don't worry.

529
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,510
- Did you call the Police?
- Not yet.

530
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,238
- Where's the phone?
- I don't know.

531
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:41,675
Come on.

532
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,753
There's the phone.

533
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,871
Not yet. Sit down.

534
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,914
I think these sadistic fuckers
were taping us.

535
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,355
And I want to find those tapes.

536
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,152
If they get into
the wrong hands...

537
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,509
Okay?

538
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:35,790
Gary!

539
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:36,597
Gary!

540
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,597
He was alive!

541
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,032
You did what you had to do.

542
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,719
He had a gun. He woulda...

543
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,309
Jen, listen to me.

544
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,835
You did nothing wrong.

545
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,193
He had a gun.

546
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,678
I should never have left you alone.

547
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,754
Maybe you should come with me.
Don't touch anything.

548
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,600
No, the phones are dead,
we need to call for help.

549
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,399
Suppose they don't believe us...

550
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,994
Believe what?

551
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,232
That we had to kill them.

552
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,599
There isn't any choice.

553
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,028
I think there is.
We just leave.

554
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,475
Leave?

555
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,791
Just walk out.
Just tell no one.

556
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:55,038
There's nothing to connect us
to these fucking people.

557
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,510
What about the fingerprints
and the tapes?

558
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,996
Well, I could wipe
this place down in 5 minutes.

559
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,233
I'll take the tapes,
could burn them too.

560
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,555
Gary...

561
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,918
You go home, and tell
everybody the truth,

562
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,799
that you fell in love with a guy
and ran away with him for a week.

563
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,674
If we live that,
people will believe it.

564
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:17,753
That simple.
We walk away.

565
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,710
Sit down.
Now wait right here, okay?

566
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,158
Don't even think
about what you just did.

567
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,472
Now in a few minutes more,
we're going to be outta here.

568
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:21,633
Beg.

569
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,231
I need you to help me clean up.

570
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:19,473
You belong to me.

571
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,674
Yeah.

572
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,234
Show me.

573
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,155
You see?

574
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,235
Yeah.

575
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:00,357
Fuck!

576
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,275
Fuck!

577
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,390
It's not dark.

578
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,315
It's not dark.

579
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,199
You're a naughty girl.

580
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:20,714
Don't be stupid.
Where are you going to go?

581
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:24,353
Come on, you couldn't even
find yourself in broad daylight.

582
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,319
Come on.

583
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,913
There's no one coming for you.
Give up.

584
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:57,635
Jennifer!

585
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,109
There's nowhere
to go, Jennifer.

586
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,395
Thank you.

587
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,275
Thank you, Jen.

588
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:49,870
Fuck!

589
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:58,592
What's real, Gary? Huh?

590
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,314
Put it down, Jennifer.

591
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:04,715
Put it down.

592
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,995
You see...
You got out of your prison.

593
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:39,715
That's more than you
can say... about me.

594
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,639
Not even in... that.
