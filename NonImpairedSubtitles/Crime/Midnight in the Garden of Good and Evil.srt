1
00:01:58,093 --> 00:02:00,368
Quit eyeballing me, Flavius.

2
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:03,685
I knew you when you was
a two-bit hustler on Bull Street.

3
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:51,043
Excuse me!
Where can a fella get a cab?

4
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:52,282
He just left.

5
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:55,047
You can call the company, but I's you,
I'd wait on him to come back.

6
00:02:55,293 --> 00:02:56,931
'Less you want to take a ride.

7
00:02:57,173 --> 00:02:59,050
- You going to Jones Street?
- I'll get you there.

8
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:01,047
Put your stuff in there.

9
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,408
To your right. Pirate's House...

10
00:03:08,653 --> 00:03:10,928
...built in 1794.

11
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:14,961
All the ne'er-do-wells and scalawags
divided up their booty there.

12
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:18,888
Sherman stayed
in the Green-Meldrim House...

13
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,931
...to rest up
after his fiery march through Atlanta.

14
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:23,811
He was going to burn Savannah...

15
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:27,045
...but the locals drowned him
in Chatham Artillery punch...

16
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:29,602
...and fancy parties
till he decided...

17
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:31,684
...to spare our fair city.

18
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:34,163
Forsyth Park. Ladies and gentlemen.

19
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:00,366
You looking for something?

20
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:03,208
No.

21
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:27,128
Mr. Kelso?

22
00:04:27,373 --> 00:04:29,204
Are you Mr. Kelso?

23
00:04:29,533 --> 00:04:32,809
I'm Lorene Baxter.
Welcome to Savannah.

24
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:36,730
Town & Country
is my favorite magazine.

25
00:04:37,253 --> 00:04:41,007
Oh, my land, where are my manners?
What can I get you to drink?

26
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:43,691
Anything cold would be great.

27
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,883
Mr. Williams restored this home.

28
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:54,931
One of the many he saved
from the wrecking ball.

29
00:04:57,413 --> 00:05:00,132
The carriage house is reserved
for Jim's clients...

30
00:05:00,373 --> 00:05:02,807
...and guests, such as yourself.

31
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:14,287
He's here.

32
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:19,402
Welcome, Mr. Kelsy.

33
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:22,486
- I'm sorry, Mr. Kelso?
- John Kelso.

34
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:24,564
Yes. I'm Betty Harty.

35
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:26,326
Sonny's been expecting you.

36
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:28,484
I'm here to see Jim Williams.

37
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,610
Sonny's Jim's attorney.

38
00:05:34,893 --> 00:05:36,167
Well, hell...

39
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:37,732
...come on in, coach.

40
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,288
John Kelso.

41
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:43,450
Welcome to the old curiosity shop.
Take a seat.

42
00:05:51,813 --> 00:05:53,724
You let me know.

43
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:58,848
- How was your trip?
- Fine. Mr. Williams said...

44
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:03,052
He will be right along. We have
a little business to attend to first.

45
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:06,763
Confidentiality agreement.
Just boilerplate stuff.

46
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:08,332
Plus a paragraph...

47
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:11,491
...outlining Jim's editorial privileges.

48
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:17,085
Town & Country flew me down to write
a 500-word story on a Christmas party.

49
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,927
It's a literary postcard.
Are you serious about this?

50
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:22,165
It's not just any party.

51
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:25,686
Have you asked the magazine?

52
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:28,766
I'd rather have your word
than some New York lawyer.

53
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:32,211
Be that as it may...

54
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:34,731
...I'm not going to sign that.

55
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:37,571
Damn! How come?

56
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,244
It's just a little old party write-up.

57
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:42,809
All the more reason
not to compromise my ethics.

58
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:45,851
As a professional,
I'm sure you understand.

59
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:52,292
Promise to be fair?

60
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,531
Yes, of course.

61
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:03,643
Jim...

62
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,851
...this is John Kelso.

63
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:08,168
Hello.

64
00:07:09,853 --> 00:07:11,923
Let's take a walk,
shall we, sport?

65
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:18,083
We'll go around Forsyth Park.

66
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:30,647
Would y'all mind...?

67
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:32,531
Not at all, Betty.

68
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:34,528
Come on.

69
00:07:41,773 --> 00:07:43,331
Did you sign Sonny's papers?

70
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:44,768
Actually, no.

71
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:49,892
Good for you. Sonny's
overly protective of my interests.

72
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:52,643
- Still walking the dog, Mr. Glover?
- Yes, sir.

73
00:07:52,893 --> 00:07:55,248
Patrick do love his morning walk.

74
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:03,845
Would you mind? Could I please have
my picture made with Uga?

75
00:08:04,253 --> 00:08:05,208
Great.

76
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:06,528
Thanks.

77
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,005
All right. Smile.

78
00:08:12,213 --> 00:08:13,931
Thanks. Dang good dog.

79
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:16,403
Thank you very much.

80
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:17,921
Thank you for asking.

81
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,331
No matter what you and I ever do
in our lives, Mr. Kelso...

82
00:08:22,613 --> 00:08:24,729
...neither of us
will be as famous as Uga.

83
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:26,602
He's the university mascot.

84
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:28,684
- "The Georgia Bulldog."
- Is that right?

85
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:32,926
I know I'm going to regret asking,
but that man said he was walking a dog.

86
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:35,848
What dog?

87
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:38,283
Mr. Glover was the law firm porter.

88
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:42,851
Mr. Bouhan said in his will that
Mr. Glover should continue to be paid...

89
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:46,250
...$ 15 every week for walking Patrick,
his Labrador.

90
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:47,608
So...

91
00:08:48,453 --> 00:08:49,442
...where's Patrick?

92
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:54,363
Patrick went on to his great rewards
2 years after Mr. Bouhan, about 1974.

93
00:08:54,653 --> 00:08:56,530
- The dog's dead.
- Quite.

94
00:08:57,613 --> 00:08:59,763
Why doesn't Mr. Glover walk Uga?

95
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:04,610
Well, then, who'd walk Patrick?

96
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:09,692
I see.

97
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:14,169
- There it is.
- This is your house?

98
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:18,932
Built by General Hugh Mercer in 1860,
but he never lived in this house.

99
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:21,169
His great-grandson was Johnny Mercer.

100
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:22,522
The songwriter?

101
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,041
Savannah's own.

102
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:26,684
What's your favorite of his tunes?

103
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:30,251
My mother was always partial
to "Fools Rush In."

104
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,802
Your mother.

105
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,489
Indeed.

106
00:09:33,893 --> 00:09:38,683
I'd love to give you the grand tour, but
they're still setting up for the party.

107
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,444
I thought the party was tomorrow night.

108
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:43,212
There are two parties.

109
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:46,411
Tonight is for bachelors.
Gentlemen only.

110
00:09:47,573 --> 00:09:48,688
Would you like to come?

111
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:50,888
I'd like to cover it.

112
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:54,284
I'm sorry. It's private.
Reporters aren't allowed.

113
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:57,525
Would you like to see my shop?
It's back here in the carriage house.

114
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:04,689
This house is one of the largest
in Savannah. It covers an entire block.

115
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:06,326
It's right in here.

116
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:08,444
This is where we do all of our...

117
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:10,172
...restorations.

118
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:23,564
This landscape, is it a Stubbs?

119
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:25,402
Very good.

120
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:27,446
My father was a dealer.

121
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,730
It's called Newmarket Heath
with a Rubbing-Down House.

122
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:33,646
It's a recent purchase I will unveil
at tomorrow night's event.

123
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:35,566
It's an odd piece.

124
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:37,891
The impasto is interesting.

125
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:40,002
Where's your black light?

126
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:50,768
It's an overpaint.

127
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:53,245
Very good, sport.

128
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,564
- You had it x-rayed yet?
- No.

129
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,245
How will you know
what it's obscuring?

130
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:05,884
I rather enjoy not knowing.

131
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,207
Just a minute.

132
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:12,691
- Who is it?
- Mandy.

133
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:13,849
Who?

134
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:16,882
I don't know a Mandy.

135
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:19,601
Of course not.
You won't open the damn door.

136
00:12:21,293 --> 00:12:23,170
Hi. Nice to meet you.

137
00:12:31,653 --> 00:12:33,564
You all got some ice?

138
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:37,172
Sure, help yourself.

139
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:40,725
Joe Odom's fridge is on the blink.
And plus, at present...

140
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:43,043
...we don't have electricity.

141
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,247
Thirsty?

142
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:49,443
Me? No.
No, not really.

143
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:55,206
If you're thirsty, a drink'll cure it.
If you're not, a drink'll prevent it.

144
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:57,802
Prevention is better than a cure.

145
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:02,609
Put on some pants, John Kelso.

146
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:06,646
Sure, just let me get a pair.

147
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:12,331
This is our newest addition
to the Odom House.

148
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:15,963
As you see, Joe's been creative
with our electrical dilemma.

149
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:22,082
I done this before
and I ain't never been killed yet.

150
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,722
But there's a first time for everything.

151
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:33,009
There we go!

152
00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:34,447
We got it!

153
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:36,563
No problem.

154
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:38,082
Joe Odom?

155
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,561
The one, the only.

156
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:41,286
Where's my libation?

157
00:13:41,573 --> 00:13:42,403
Hold these.

158
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:46,328
To Savannah Electric and Power!

159
00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:49,282
And let's not forget our friends...

160
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:50,763
...the...

161
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:51,929
...whoever!

162
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:55,762
Here's to you!
All right, inside.

163
00:13:56,773 --> 00:14:01,130
Honey, that's a tough job,
but you're talking to the lady. Hello!

164
00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:05,006
Have you met Mr. Kelso,
our newest addition to Savannah?

165
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:06,612
Jerry Spence.

166
00:14:06,853 --> 00:14:08,571
- How are you?
- I'm charmed now.

167
00:14:08,853 --> 00:14:10,969
- How are you?
- I'm pretty good.

168
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:13,329
- I wonder if he goes to my church?
- I wonder.

169
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:14,642
Episcopalian.

170
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:16,087
We'll find out.

171
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,561
Sanitation

172
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:20,733
I see all night long
Hauling in great big cans

173
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:26,244
I'm hoping one day soon
She'll let me be a Hefty man

174
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:30,082
In the Dumpster
We'll be making love

175
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,483
In the Dumpster
Beneath the stars above

176
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:35,168
In the Dumpster
I smell paradise

177
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:37,284
Don 't have to ask me twice

178
00:14:37,573 --> 00:14:39,529
It's all I'm thinking of

179
00:14:39,773 --> 00:14:42,333
Just me and that trash girl
Making that Dumpster love

180
00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:55,449
Do you like that?

181
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:56,842
Strong.

182
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:59,886
Strong and good.
Chatham Artillery punch.

183
00:15:00,173 --> 00:15:01,128
What's in it?

184
00:15:01,373 --> 00:15:03,091
3 parts fruit, 7 parts liquor.

185
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:05,329
Whatever's available on both counts.

186
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:07,291
Great party. Great house.

187
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:12,690
The fella that owns it is in Europe
for a year. Asked me to look in on it.

188
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:14,292
Water the plants.

189
00:15:17,573 --> 00:15:18,369
Squatting?

190
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:21,485
That's a vicious word.

191
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:23,451
You're not a lawyer, are you?

192
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,205
Good. They're the scum of the earth.
And I should know...

193
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:31,053
...being an ex-barrister myself.

194
00:15:31,453 --> 00:15:32,408
Ex?

195
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:36,204
Ceremoniously disbarred
not two years ago.

196
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:38,370
Had a little accounting snafu.

197
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:40,201
What do you do now?

198
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:43,251
Me and Mandy,
we're going to open a piano bar.

199
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:44,608
You already have one.

200
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:46,332
Looks that way, doesn't it?

201
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:49,003
Wait a minute. Hold the music.

202
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:50,169
Look.

203
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:53,321
Look at this.

204
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:54,722
Jerry Spence.

205
00:15:55,893 --> 00:15:58,612
You have outdone yourself again.

206
00:15:58,853 --> 00:16:02,448
That is a coif definitely befitting
your stature as the future ex...

207
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:04,172
...Mrs. Joe Odom.

208
00:16:04,893 --> 00:16:06,611
Keep dreaming, darling.

209
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:08,207
You're in love.

210
00:16:11,813 --> 00:16:13,804
She is one beautiful woman.

211
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,572
You two engaged?

212
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:17,842
Not yet.

213
00:16:19,573 --> 00:16:22,645
It's getting late. I'm going to
hit the road. Nice meeting you.

214
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:24,246
No, wait a minute.

215
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:26,771
Joe's rule #2:

216
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:31,046
If you have to leave a party,
you always take a traveler.

217
00:16:32,013 --> 00:16:34,402
I can live with that one.
Nice to meet you.

218
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:42,722
Hey, there.

219
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:46,167
Better to be on the edge of a party,
don't you think?

220
00:16:48,413 --> 00:16:49,687
Thanks for inviting me.

221
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:50,968
Anytime.

222
00:16:51,213 --> 00:16:52,487
Every time.

223
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,008
Earlier...

224
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,572
...how'd you know my name?

225
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:03,445
Welcome to Savannah.

226
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:12,328
Mr. John Kelso?

227
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:15,368
This is for you.

228
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:26,683
I'm not in. Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

229
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:48,371
- Mr. Kelso?
- Yes.

230
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:51,207
I'm Lucille Wright.
I cater Mr. Williams' parties.

231
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:53,171
- Nice to meet you.
- He'll be down shortly.

232
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:55,165
Would you like to see what we'll serve?

233
00:17:55,413 --> 00:17:56,607
Of course.

234
00:17:56,853 --> 00:17:57,922
Come in.

235
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,488
Lots of fresh vegetables...

236
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,291
...hot bread...

237
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:05,932
...jumbo shrimp.

238
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:10,127
Let's see.
This is smoked ham and turkey.

239
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:11,449
Both.

240
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:15,652
A big fruit platter.
And this is a wonderful crab dish.

241
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:16,803
A bisque?

242
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:18,123
Jeff Braswell.

243
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:23,009
- I shoot Jim's parties.
- Let's get a shot of the whole spread.

244
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:25,642
Town & Country
loves its pretty pictures.

245
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:28,089
And pumpkin cornbread.

246
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:33,002
Mr. Williams insists on
low-country cooking for his parties.

247
00:18:33,493 --> 00:18:36,291
Oh, you're going to have fun tonight.

248
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,285
Indeed he is, Lucille.

249
00:18:39,413 --> 00:18:41,722
Good fit. 44 long.

250
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,608
I have an eye for framing things.

251
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:51,924
Welcome to Mercer House, Mr. Kelso.

252
00:18:52,853 --> 00:18:55,242
You have outdone yourself again
this year.

253
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:56,972
Well, thank you.

254
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:32,926
I'm glad to see you.
Merry Christmas.

255
00:19:33,293 --> 00:19:34,646
Merry Christmas.

256
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:38,363
There you are. The man with the cigar.
So happy you're back.

257
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:40,048
Emma.

258
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,207
Did you watch my drink for me?
Merry Christmas.

259
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:46,808
I thought you'd tried
to steal it from me.

260
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,925
- Senator, how are you?
- Great.

261
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:52,770
Merry Christmas to you.
So happy to have you here.

262
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:54,807
Look at you.

263
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:59,050
Welcome to Mercer House.

264
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:21,453
I think we have
quite a party going tonight.

265
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,449
Look at that niece of mine.
Come over here.

266
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,650
- How are you?
- John Kelso.

267
00:20:41,893 --> 00:20:45,602
Oh, darling!
You look so pretty tonight.

268
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:47,605
I have one just like that at home.

269
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:51,127
I see our emerald bird has arrived.

270
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:54,162
Good to see you.
Handsome as ever.

271
00:20:54,413 --> 00:20:56,722
- How are you, dear?
- I'm just fine.

272
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:03,643
Now who is that magnificent creature?

273
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:05,167
That is Serena Dawes.

274
00:21:05,413 --> 00:21:07,608
Serena, you are
as gorgeous as ever.

275
00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:09,081
I try.

276
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,130
Celebrated beauty in her day.

277
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:14,888
When her tycoon husband died, she
moved back to Savannah and created...

278
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:17,931
...sort of a museum to herself
in her boudoir.

279
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:19,572
I'll introduce you.

280
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:22,088
- You look very nice.
- Who are these people?

281
00:21:23,853 --> 00:21:26,367
How lovely to see you out of bed.

282
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:31,203
Why, Jim,
I'd get out of bed for you anytime.

283
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:39,211
Harry was just about to show us
the latest addition to his arsenal.

284
00:21:41,573 --> 00:21:44,133
You know what that is?
That is a.25.

285
00:21:44,413 --> 00:21:47,530
My late husband blew his brains out
with one of those.

286
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,684
- So did mine.
- What?

287
00:21:50,053 --> 00:21:53,841
I was fixing myself a drink and Gunsmoke
was on TV and I heard a shot.

288
00:21:54,173 --> 00:21:58,689
I thought it was part of the show till
I walked in and Lyman was bleeding...

289
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:01,401
...sprawled in his favorite chair.

290
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,167
Everyone knew
our marriage was a disaster.

291
00:22:04,413 --> 00:22:09,009
If I'd so much as touched that gun,
they'd have charged me with murder.

292
00:22:11,773 --> 00:22:13,729
Yes, well, one day...

293
00:22:17,613 --> 00:22:21,083
...I will shoot a man.
I may start with you. Or you.

294
00:22:27,373 --> 00:22:29,091
- Is that loaded?
- Oh, yeah.

295
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:32,652
Which conversation shall we join?

296
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,453
The one least likely to involve gunfire.

297
00:22:35,973 --> 00:22:37,611
Excuse me for a moment.

298
00:22:57,773 --> 00:23:00,128
That's from Napoleon's
coronation carriage.

299
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:02,811
You have an impressive collection.

300
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:07,368
No, Mr. Kelso. Look around.
It's not a collection, it's my home.

301
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:09,763
- Fabergé?
- I'm a minor enthusiast.

302
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,083
Minor? Three eggs...

303
00:23:12,493 --> 00:23:15,212
...a jewelry box and, I believe,
a gold-leaf album.

304
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:18,611
Nicholas himself would be lucky
to have so much Fabergé.

305
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:22,403
Wouldn't he?

306
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:23,927
I admit to that.

307
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:27,607
Would you care
to see something a little more...

308
00:23:27,893 --> 00:23:29,167
...unusual?

309
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:30,892
That'd be very nice.

310
00:23:36,853 --> 00:23:38,525
Hello, Mother, darling.

311
00:23:38,773 --> 00:23:41,526
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- I'm having a wonderful time.

312
00:23:41,773 --> 00:23:42,967
John Kelso.

313
00:23:43,613 --> 00:23:45,171
He's a writer, Mother.

314
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:55,723
This is what we call the ballroom.

315
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:02,291
Is this the prized relic?

316
00:24:02,653 --> 00:24:04,962
It's a very rare relic.

317
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,410
This is the dagger
that Prince Yussopov used...

318
00:24:11,893 --> 00:24:13,326
...to murder Rasputin.

319
00:24:16,053 --> 00:24:18,521
He sliced off
his cock and balls with it.

320
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:19,967
True story...

321
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:22,807
...and deliciously evil,
don't you think?

322
00:24:23,573 --> 00:24:24,722
Delicious.

323
00:24:28,013 --> 00:24:29,082
German Luger?

324
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:32,052
Be careful, it's loaded.
We've had burglaries.

325
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:35,368
Everybody's got loaded guns around here.

326
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:39,853
So tell me.
Has your family always collected?

327
00:24:40,093 --> 00:24:44,006
That's a very genteel way of asking
if I come from old money.

328
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,246
- Do you?
- No.

329
00:24:47,293 --> 00:24:50,365
I was born in Gordon, Georgia,
a little town outside of Macon.

330
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:52,843
My father was a barber,
sometime house builder.

331
00:24:53,093 --> 00:24:54,685
My mother was a secretary.

332
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:57,447
What money I have is about 11 years old.

333
00:24:57,893 --> 00:24:59,929
So, yes, I am...

334
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:01,731
...nouveau riche.

335
00:25:01,973 --> 00:25:04,328
But then it's the riche that counts.

336
00:25:05,013 --> 00:25:06,685
There's only 2 things
that interest me...

337
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:07,922
...work...

338
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,563
...and those trappings of aristocracy
that I find worthwhile.

339
00:25:11,853 --> 00:25:15,528
The very things they're forced to sell
when the money runs out.

340
00:25:15,773 --> 00:25:17,411
And it always runs out.

341
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:19,809
And then all they're left with...

342
00:25:20,373 --> 00:25:22,045
...is their lovely manners.

343
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:25,205
Fuck you, goddamn bitch!

344
00:25:25,813 --> 00:25:27,724
Wouldn't even let me in the house.

345
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:29,565
Had to come in the servants' entrance.

346
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:32,006
Excuse me for a minute?

347
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,444
We agreed you'd stay away tonight.

348
00:25:36,693 --> 00:25:38,445
Don't give me that drag-ass shit.

349
00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:41,890
I got stood up tonight, I'm pissed off.
Give me $20.

350
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,887
You get paid on Friday
like everyone else.

351
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:47,168
Give me $20.

352
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:51,008
- I need it to get fucked up, is what.
- You've accomplished that, sport.

353
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:52,603
Give me the money.

354
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:55,532
I ain't even close to getting fucked up
the way I want to get.

355
00:25:55,773 --> 00:25:58,571
I'm not going to give you money
for liquor or marijuana...

356
00:25:58,813 --> 00:26:00,326
...or whatever else you've invited...

357
00:26:01,213 --> 00:26:02,328
Fuck you, Jim!

358
00:26:02,573 --> 00:26:06,282
You don't give me warnings! I give them
to you! I can back mine up.

359
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:13,571
And you, you piece of shit!

360
00:26:16,013 --> 00:26:17,651
You better watch yourself.

361
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:21,168
Fuck you.

362
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,881
That's Billy Hanson.
He works part-time in the shop...

363
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:42,132
...and can, on occasion,
be a very colorful character.

364
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:09,688
I don't know who hates me more,
the Atwells or their dogs.

365
00:27:09,933 --> 00:27:13,926
Lon Atwell's been upset with me since I
had him removed from the museum board.

366
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:20,848
There's only one way to remedy this.

367
00:28:23,013 --> 00:28:24,526
Thank you, Senator.

368
00:28:24,773 --> 00:28:26,684
It was a hell of a bash, Jim.

369
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:29,328
- You've outdone yourself.
- Delightful.

370
00:28:29,613 --> 00:28:32,252
We thoroughly enjoyed it.
Thanks for having us.

371
00:28:42,373 --> 00:28:43,931
This...
You have my book.

372
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:45,925
You seem surprised.

373
00:28:46,813 --> 00:28:49,566
It didn't exactly
fly off the bookshelves.

374
00:28:56,573 --> 00:28:59,371
What a coincidence,
that I'd be assigned...

375
00:28:59,693 --> 00:29:02,765
...to this story
and you'd have read my only book.

376
00:29:04,653 --> 00:29:06,644
There are no coincidences.

377
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:09,681
Have you ever written
for Town & Country before?

378
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:10,883
No.

379
00:29:14,813 --> 00:29:16,246
You requested me?

380
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:21,491
They've wanted to cover
my Christmas party for years.

381
00:29:21,773 --> 00:29:26,164
My acceptance of their offer this year
was contingent on one thing:

382
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:27,971
Your participation.

383
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:32,327
Thank you for that.

384
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:34,852
No, thank you.

385
00:29:36,173 --> 00:29:40,849
Now sit back, relax, enjoy your brandy
and tell me your life story, John Kelso.

386
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:47,488
It's getting late
and I have an early flight...

387
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:51,203
...so maybe I can take
a rain check on that. Next Christmas.

388
00:29:52,013 --> 00:29:53,651
If you make the cut.

389
00:29:54,613 --> 00:29:56,331
We'll hope for the best.

390
00:29:56,613 --> 00:29:59,844
I can't wait to see the article,
and I hope you have enough...

391
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:01,812
...for your 500-word essay.

392
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:03,924
Believe me, I could use 10,000.

393
00:30:04,173 --> 00:30:06,084
Thanks for everything.
I'll show myself out.

394
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,846
Oh, and sport...

395
00:30:14,253 --> 00:30:15,971
...I really did like your book.

396
00:30:17,373 --> 00:30:18,408
Thank you.

397
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:42,731
That's a beautiful jacket.
I believe it's an endangered species.

398
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:46,249
Look at that 14-karat gold dress
and Tony Manero.

399
00:30:46,493 --> 00:30:47,767
Who's hungry?

400
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,410
Want some punch, baby?

401
00:30:50,653 --> 00:30:53,167
Oh, that's such a good pony.

402
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:56,167
What are you doing,
getting that horse drunk?

403
00:30:57,293 --> 00:30:58,203
What happened?

404
00:30:58,533 --> 00:31:00,808
That Jim Williams
went and shot somebody.

405
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:02,088
Canapé?

406
00:31:02,813 --> 00:31:03,689
What?

407
00:31:03,973 --> 00:31:07,283
He sure did. Those lights
ain't part of the Christmas display.

408
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:08,403
For real?

409
00:31:08,653 --> 00:31:10,769
Yes, sir. He shot somebody.

410
00:31:12,093 --> 00:31:13,685
Look at that man go.

411
00:31:13,933 --> 00:31:15,764
I'm starting to like that Yankee.

412
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:19,642
What's that saying?
Curiosity killed the Yankee? That's it.

413
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:28,969
He was drunker when he got back,
and I'll tell you...

414
00:31:29,613 --> 00:31:33,925
...when he's been drinking,
he's got another personality altogether.

415
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:37,287
He'd already smashed things upstairs
earlier.

416
00:31:37,613 --> 00:31:40,650
And he must've gone
to some drive-in B movie...

417
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,844
...with throats being slashed.

418
00:31:43,093 --> 00:31:47,564
No doubt it had an effect,
because I've never seen him that angry.

419
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:50,408
He and I got into an argument.

420
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:54,726
He destroyed this beautiful,
priceless antique clock in the hallway.

421
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,207
If you'd like to...

422
00:31:56,773 --> 00:31:57,842
...spike that up...

423
00:31:58,093 --> 00:31:59,492
...the bar's in the living room.

424
00:31:59,733 --> 00:32:01,644
No, thank you.
I'm still on duty.

425
00:32:03,773 --> 00:32:04,842
I know that.

426
00:32:06,573 --> 00:32:07,688
I'm sorry.

427
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:09,964
This is very upsetting.

428
00:32:10,853 --> 00:32:13,083
How much longer
is this going to take?

429
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:23,406
What are you doing here?

430
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,008
I work for the city, too.
I got the film from that party.

431
00:32:26,253 --> 00:32:27,447
I'll get it to you.

432
00:32:27,733 --> 00:32:28,927
Great, great.

433
00:32:38,413 --> 00:32:41,689
He came into the office
and he stood there and he yelled...

434
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:45,568
..."I might be leaving tomorrow, but
goddamn it, you're leaving tonight."

435
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:49,806
Then he fired at me twice and I pulled
the Luger from my desk and fired back.

436
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:53,130
If it had happened to you,
you would've done exactly what I did.

437
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:56,570
I have never been so scared in my life.
If I had not shot at Billy...

438
00:32:56,813 --> 00:33:00,010
...I have no doubt it'd be my obituary
you'd be reading tomorrow.

439
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:02,369
- What're you doing here?
- The thing was open.

440
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:03,887
Jesus Christ, Frank!

441
00:33:05,053 --> 00:33:06,964
My client has nothing to say.

442
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:12,091
I can't believe you would do this
without calling me!

443
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,085
How long have we known each other?!

444
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:17,206
Is this entrapment, Frank?
What the hell is going on?

445
00:33:56,253 --> 00:33:58,767
Sorry, I'm not going to have time
to process this.

446
00:33:59,013 --> 00:34:00,924
Film from the party.

447
00:34:12,173 --> 00:34:15,131
Jim told me
you heard Hanson threaten him.

448
00:34:15,813 --> 00:34:17,405
No-good street hustler.

449
00:34:17,733 --> 00:34:19,883
I told Jim he was dangerous.

450
00:34:25,653 --> 00:34:27,086
Forget about Town & Country.

451
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:31,167
I know I've been here only 3 days and
it's just a shooting, but give it time.

452
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:34,570
This place is fantastic. It's like
Gone With the Wind on mescaline.

453
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,762
I know you're my agent.
Listen to me.

454
00:34:38,013 --> 00:34:41,130
They walk imaginary pets here
on a fucking leash, okay?

455
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,682
They're all heavily armed and drunk.
New York is boring.

456
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:45,127
I'll call you later.

457
00:34:46,573 --> 00:34:50,612
Finley Largent's up for reelection,
so he'll try to get this to trial.

458
00:34:50,853 --> 00:34:52,923
He won't take my damn phone calls...

459
00:34:53,173 --> 00:34:55,209
...so we'll have to use the back door.

460
00:34:55,453 --> 00:34:56,772
I'll be back.

461
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:58,924
Thanks for coming over, coach.

462
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:01,005
Jim's in the office.

463
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:08,968
We talked about something
we'd like to run by you.

464
00:35:09,253 --> 00:35:11,084
You want me to kill the story.

465
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:12,723
Done.

466
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:16,212
Great, great.

467
00:35:19,013 --> 00:35:19,923
Why?

468
00:35:21,173 --> 00:35:22,606
Actually, I was...

469
00:35:23,013 --> 00:35:24,287
...considering...

470
00:35:24,693 --> 00:35:25,887
...writing a book.

471
00:35:26,453 --> 00:35:28,762
Sweet Jesus. A book about what?

472
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:30,765
Self-defense happens all the time.

473
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:34,050
Then why are you worried about the D.A.?
I overheard in the lobby.

474
00:35:34,293 --> 00:35:35,885
We're a small town.

475
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:38,601
We defend ourselves, our reputations...

476
00:35:38,933 --> 00:35:40,685
...against the outside world.

477
00:35:41,093 --> 00:35:44,130
Word gets around a New Yorker's
trying to make us look bad...

478
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:46,928
...you'll find Savannahians
can get tight-lipped.

479
00:35:47,973 --> 00:35:49,884
If there's a trial, will I be a witness?

480
00:35:50,293 --> 00:35:51,567
You threatening me?

481
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:52,808
Absolutely not.

482
00:35:53,173 --> 00:35:55,812
You perjure yourself,
you'll find yourself in jail.

483
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:59,250
I wouldn't do it. When it comes
to this, I'm at ground zero.

484
00:35:59,613 --> 00:36:01,171
If there's nothing worth writing...

485
00:36:01,613 --> 00:36:02,932
...then you got no worries.

486
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:06,849
That's what I get paid for.
I will not permit this.

487
00:36:10,933 --> 00:36:13,242
I don't need anyone's permission.

488
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,407
Not really.

489
00:36:17,813 --> 00:36:19,724
Then why are you soliciting it?

490
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:24,766
You need my permission...

491
00:36:25,013 --> 00:36:26,048
...my help...

492
00:36:26,293 --> 00:36:27,851
...my acquiescence...

493
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:30,205
...or you don't have a story.

494
00:36:31,173 --> 00:36:32,367
Not really.

495
00:36:33,173 --> 00:36:34,891
We both know that.

496
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:40,001
So would the river flow both ways?

497
00:36:40,773 --> 00:36:41,888
Meaning?

498
00:36:43,893 --> 00:36:47,727
Would you share whatever information
you garner with me and Sonny?

499
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:52,326
Yes, but it won't change what I write.

500
00:36:52,653 --> 00:36:55,531
And you don't get to see a word of it
until it's published.

501
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:07,722
So...

502
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:10,648
...who'd be the main character
in this book?

503
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,688
Have you written up cases
like this before?

504
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:21,889
A few of them for Esquire. Yeah.

505
00:37:22,133 --> 00:37:23,361
What do you think?

506
00:37:23,613 --> 00:37:24,841
What do I think?

507
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:28,330
If you're worried about the D.A.,
grand juries read papers.

508
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:30,848
Proper spin control
could make a big difference.

509
00:37:31,093 --> 00:37:32,924
What the hell are you talking about?

510
00:37:33,173 --> 00:37:35,971
You said Hanson was a street hustler.
Did he have a record?

511
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:38,010
Take drugs?
Deal drugs? Pimp?

512
00:37:38,253 --> 00:37:40,483
That kind of spin
can influence a grand jury.

513
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:42,371
Get investigators to hit the streets.

514
00:37:42,613 --> 00:37:45,286
Every P.I. In town's an off-duty cop.

515
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:48,452
Besides, why would we need a P. I...

516
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:51,810
...when we got ourselves
a hotshot New York writer...

517
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:53,805
...filling all the gaps?

518
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:57,492
Take care, bubba.

519
00:38:17,453 --> 00:38:19,444
- Are you the flower man?
- No, I'm John Kelso.

520
00:38:19,693 --> 00:38:21,923
Good morning, I'm a writer
and wanted to ask you...

521
00:38:22,173 --> 00:38:24,562
If you're not the flower man,
leave me be.

522
00:38:24,813 --> 00:38:28,567
The Lady's in mourning, and
I haven't received a flower or a rose...

523
00:38:28,813 --> 00:38:31,725
...or anything to show for it.
Please leave me be.

524
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:39,047
I know Billy Hanson used to live here.
I wanted to ask a few questions.

525
00:38:39,293 --> 00:38:41,966
And if it's an inappropriate time,
I'll come back later.

526
00:38:42,213 --> 00:38:46,889
I can't believe you're running around
ringing my doorbell. Where you from?

527
00:38:47,213 --> 00:38:48,885
Where are your manners?

528
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:50,885
Just leave me be.

529
00:38:53,613 --> 00:38:55,729
My condolences.
I'll call...

530
00:38:56,493 --> 00:38:58,723
I'll come back another time, or...

531
00:40:22,573 --> 00:40:24,962
I apologize for the delay.

532
00:40:26,733 --> 00:40:31,443
Why, thank you. They're lovely.
They're absolutely lovely.

533
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:34,412
I'd love to ask you a few questions,
if you have a minute.

534
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:36,611
Is this your car?

535
00:40:38,573 --> 00:40:40,131
How about a ride home?

536
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:45,248
Thank you.

537
00:40:53,893 --> 00:40:56,965
What I want to know is,
what is a white boy like you...

538
00:40:57,213 --> 00:41:01,525
...doing driving a big old brother's
jive-ass heap like this shit here?

539
00:41:01,773 --> 00:41:04,924
I just bought this.
I kind of like it. It's not a bad car.

540
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:07,767
No, it's not bad.
Did I hurt your feelings?

541
00:41:08,013 --> 00:41:10,607
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

542
00:41:10,853 --> 00:41:14,163
I can't help it.
I just call things out as I see it.

543
00:41:14,413 --> 00:41:16,290
I just can't help it.
I just do that.

544
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:19,207
- One thing you needn't worry about.
- What's that?

545
00:41:19,453 --> 00:41:23,002
Ain't nobody going to try
to steal this piece of shit.

546
00:41:23,653 --> 00:41:26,963
I'm just practicing up till I can save
enough money to get my Rolls.

547
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:30,011
Chablis is a pretty name.
It's unusual.

548
00:41:30,253 --> 00:41:34,326
Thank you. I got it off a wine bottle.
It's a show name.

549
00:41:34,573 --> 00:41:38,282
- You're an actress?
- I'm not an actress. I'm a showgirl.

550
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:40,967
I work at the Pick-Up on Congress.

551
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:44,888
I lip-synch, I emcee, I dance.
You know, shit like that.

552
00:41:45,133 --> 00:41:48,887
The person you see now
is just little old simple Chablis.

553
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:50,452
But in the evenings...

554
00:41:50,693 --> 00:41:53,924
...when I put on my gowns
and my makeup...

555
00:41:54,173 --> 00:41:56,767
...and my jewelry and my perfume...

556
00:41:57,013 --> 00:41:59,163
...I become "The Lady Chablis."

557
00:42:01,573 --> 00:42:03,928
You are just so cute.

558
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:06,448
A cool white wine for a cool black girl.

559
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:09,730
And you're full of flattery too.

560
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:14,890
It's getting hot up in here, honey.
My shots are kicking in.

561
00:42:16,413 --> 00:42:17,323
Excuse me?

562
00:42:17,573 --> 00:42:20,087
Yes, honey, my shots.
Never mind that.

563
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:22,403
What'd you want to talk to me about?

564
00:42:23,933 --> 00:42:25,048
Billy Hanson.

565
00:42:26,973 --> 00:42:30,568
No. Billy's dead.
Case closed.

566
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,572
Was he your boyfriend?

567
00:42:32,813 --> 00:42:34,326
Billy, my boyfriend?

568
00:42:34,573 --> 00:42:35,972
Were you two lovers?

569
00:42:36,773 --> 00:42:38,001
No. Hell, no.

570
00:42:38,253 --> 00:42:41,051
Billy was way too trashy for me, honey.
I'm a lady.

571
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:43,932
However, he did date
my roommate Corinne for a while.

572
00:42:45,453 --> 00:42:49,082
The two of those
had some wild times together.

573
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:56,443
- Those are beautiful.
- So, tell me more about Corinne.

574
00:42:57,173 --> 00:42:59,448
Corinne's like a lot of girls.

575
00:43:00,053 --> 00:43:03,284
She found herself attracted
to the wrong type of man.

576
00:43:04,093 --> 00:43:07,802
Billy was not the right type of man.
She thought she could change him.

577
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:11,250
But there was no way of changing
that evil son of a bitch.

578
00:43:11,493 --> 00:43:13,961
- I'd love to speak to Corinne.
- I'd like to too.

579
00:43:14,213 --> 00:43:18,286
But she skipped town
owing me two months' rent.

580
00:43:18,533 --> 00:43:21,366
And Billy said he would pay for it,
but now he's...

581
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,531
But you know...

582
00:43:25,773 --> 00:43:27,843
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

583
00:43:28,093 --> 00:43:30,812
But you know,
it's like my mama always said...

584
00:43:32,893 --> 00:43:34,849
..."Two tears in a bucket...

585
00:43:35,093 --> 00:43:37,209
...motherfuck it."

586
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:39,886
I have to remember that one.

587
00:43:40,133 --> 00:43:42,408
Don't remember that one.
That's off-the-record.

588
00:43:50,053 --> 00:43:51,532
Let me get your door for you.

589
00:44:04,653 --> 00:44:06,086
Thank you, hon.

590
00:44:11,853 --> 00:44:15,641
In the phone book,
you were listed as F. De Veau.

591
00:44:17,573 --> 00:44:19,131
What's the "F" stand for?

592
00:44:20,973 --> 00:44:23,362
The "F" stands for Frank, hon.

593
00:44:23,613 --> 00:44:24,841
That's me.

594
00:44:38,853 --> 00:44:40,684
- She's a he.
- Correct.

595
00:44:40,853 --> 00:44:42,127
You're shitting me.

596
00:44:42,373 --> 00:44:45,092
If this thing heats up,
I think you'll want to talk to her.

597
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:47,164
Proper folks don't discuss such things.

598
00:44:47,613 --> 00:44:49,444
She paints a rotten picture of Billy.

599
00:44:49,693 --> 00:44:52,844
Let me tell you a story.
There was a judge here years ago.

600
00:44:53,093 --> 00:44:56,563
His oldest boy was messing around
with a gangster's girlfriend.

601
00:44:57,533 --> 00:44:59,410
One morning they found him...

602
00:45:00,053 --> 00:45:03,443
...lying under the porch
with his privates tucked into his lapel.

603
00:45:05,813 --> 00:45:07,804
Dead men tell no tales.

604
00:45:08,693 --> 00:45:10,684
Next day, headline read...

605
00:45:10,933 --> 00:45:12,764
..."Fall From Porch Proves Fatal."

606
00:45:13,973 --> 00:45:15,804
Some fall.
What's your point?

607
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:20,531
Saving face in the light of unpleasant
circumstances is the Savannah way.

608
00:45:21,973 --> 00:45:24,612
I'll try to track down that real girl.
Corinne, you said?

609
00:45:25,213 --> 00:45:26,931
Well, I got to skedaddle.

610
00:45:27,173 --> 00:45:30,131
Doing Christmas at Tybee Island.
We got all sorts of folks coming.

611
00:45:30,373 --> 00:45:31,692
Have a great Christmas.

612
00:45:31,933 --> 00:45:34,288
- You too, John.
- See you later, Uga.

613
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:45,169
Merry Christmas!

614
00:46:27,373 --> 00:46:28,931
He's got it on a string!

615
00:46:50,853 --> 00:46:52,411
Luther's not eating!

616
00:47:00,493 --> 00:47:01,687
Check, please.

617
00:47:03,013 --> 00:47:04,332
You didn't like it?

618
00:47:04,773 --> 00:47:07,048
No, they were very good.
Excellent.

619
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,892
What was in the vial?

620
00:47:12,493 --> 00:47:15,690
He says it's enough poison
to kill everybody in the county.

621
00:47:17,493 --> 00:47:19,449
If he eats and it's a good day...

622
00:47:19,693 --> 00:47:20,603
...fine.

623
00:47:21,293 --> 00:47:22,408
If he doesn't eat...

624
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:26,931
...let's put it this way: If I were
you, I wouldn't drink the water today.

625
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:28,846
Where does he put the poison?

626
00:47:29,093 --> 00:47:31,402
In the water supply system.

627
00:47:33,773 --> 00:47:35,206
Is that true?
Do you believe that?

628
00:47:37,253 --> 00:47:41,644
I've lived here a long time, honey.
I believe most anything about anybody.

629
00:47:45,133 --> 00:47:46,407
Where are we going?

630
00:47:46,653 --> 00:47:48,530
Patience, dear boy.

631
00:47:52,893 --> 00:47:56,772
It's time you meet the most important
member of my defense team.

632
00:47:57,253 --> 00:47:58,652
We're going to the cemetery?

633
00:47:58,893 --> 00:48:02,363
Not Bonaventure.
The colored cemetery's down the road.

634
00:49:03,253 --> 00:49:06,290
Looks like we got the garden
all to ourselves tonight.

635
00:49:08,933 --> 00:49:10,332
Meet Minerva.

636
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:14,288
How do you do?

637
00:49:15,973 --> 00:49:17,691
You trying to work me, boy?

638
00:49:18,973 --> 00:49:21,043
Put that hand back in your pocket.

639
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:30,489
I feel sorry for you.

640
00:49:31,293 --> 00:49:32,885
Do tell, Minerva.

641
00:49:33,373 --> 00:49:35,284
He think nobody love him.

642
00:49:38,813 --> 00:49:40,531
That's silly.
We've never met.

643
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:44,812
You got a hole in you.

644
00:49:45,053 --> 00:49:46,611
Too many questions.

645
00:49:46,853 --> 00:49:50,971
Don't know whether to be this way
or that without the answers.

646
00:49:53,173 --> 00:49:55,733
There ain't no answers.

647
00:50:00,933 --> 00:50:04,209
You come a long way to find that out,
didn't you?

648
00:50:07,173 --> 00:50:09,971
Now we got to get to work.
You bring the money?

649
00:50:12,253 --> 00:50:13,322
Put it on the grave.

650
00:50:15,653 --> 00:50:18,167
Kiss it first,
so it come back to you.

651
00:50:20,533 --> 00:50:22,683
You bring the shiny dimes?

652
00:50:29,733 --> 00:50:30,848
Bury them.

653
00:50:31,973 --> 00:50:34,965
He's working hard against you, James.

654
00:50:35,253 --> 00:50:36,891
Who? Dr. Buzzard?

655
00:50:39,133 --> 00:50:41,169
The boy. The dead boy.

656
00:50:41,693 --> 00:50:43,684
Oh, Billy.
That doesn't surprise us.

657
00:50:43,933 --> 00:50:45,332
Dr. Buzzard?

658
00:50:47,413 --> 00:50:48,846
Ain't got much dead time left.

659
00:50:49,893 --> 00:50:51,087
Dead time?

660
00:50:51,973 --> 00:50:53,531
Lasts an hour.

661
00:50:53,853 --> 00:50:57,084
Half-hour before midnight
till half past.

662
00:50:57,533 --> 00:51:00,411
Half-hour before midnight
for working good.

663
00:51:00,733 --> 00:51:02,803
Half-hour after for evil.

664
00:51:03,053 --> 00:51:05,248
We'll need a little of both tonight.

665
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:07,125
You got the bottle of water?

666
00:51:09,453 --> 00:51:11,171
Ain't been through no pipe?

667
00:51:12,453 --> 00:51:13,727
Give it to me.

668
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:20,006
We got to make him...

669
00:51:20,253 --> 00:51:23,165
...Ioosen up on James.

670
00:51:26,893 --> 00:51:28,212
I need Shango...

671
00:51:28,893 --> 00:51:30,963
...and a little hungan.

672
00:51:43,853 --> 00:51:44,888
Come.

673
00:51:46,293 --> 00:51:47,408
Come!

674
00:51:52,373 --> 00:51:54,284
Tell me something about him.

675
00:51:55,093 --> 00:51:56,492
He tried to kill me?

676
00:51:56,733 --> 00:51:59,122
No, before then.
Something good.

677
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:02,048
Your kind words...

678
00:52:02,293 --> 00:52:04,761
...take root, flower,
come back to bless you.

679
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:07,964
Something that made him happy?

680
00:52:11,453 --> 00:52:12,568
His Camaro.

681
00:52:13,293 --> 00:52:15,932
He loved his Camaro.
He wouldn't let anyone near it.

682
00:52:16,173 --> 00:52:18,323
That car was his pride and joy.

683
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:21,168
Keep talking. It's working.
It's working!

684
00:52:22,693 --> 00:52:25,651
He spray painted it flat black.

685
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:29,169
You should've seen him.
He spent hours on that car, fixing it...

686
00:52:29,413 --> 00:52:30,368
...cleaning it.

687
00:52:30,613 --> 00:52:32,808
He painted racing stripes on it...

688
00:52:33,053 --> 00:52:34,771
...and all kinds of other things.

689
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:36,886
He was very creative.

690
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,723
That's something
most people didn't know.

691
00:52:41,973 --> 00:52:43,372
He was an artist.

692
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:46,601
Just now,
when you were saying them things...

693
00:52:46,853 --> 00:52:48,844
...I felt him ease off.

694
00:52:49,653 --> 00:52:51,689
He heard you say you love him.

695
00:52:54,813 --> 00:52:57,327
That's preposterous.
He tried to kill me.

696
00:52:59,613 --> 00:53:02,002
He was working against you,
and now I know why.

697
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:05,689
He wants you to tell the whole world
you hated him.

698
00:53:06,693 --> 00:53:09,002
Maybe they think you hated him
enough to kill him.

699
00:53:09,733 --> 00:53:11,689
If you do that, you go to jail...

700
00:53:11,933 --> 00:53:13,207
...and he know that.

701
00:53:14,813 --> 00:53:16,644
Most important thing:

702
00:53:17,733 --> 00:53:21,692
You got to beg that boy's forgiveness
each and every day.

703
00:53:27,453 --> 00:53:29,284
Time for evil.

704
00:53:34,013 --> 00:53:36,447
Quick, quick.
Tell me his name.

705
00:53:36,933 --> 00:53:38,332
Finley Largent.

706
00:53:38,973 --> 00:53:43,524
When you get home, write his name
7 times on a piece of paper.

707
00:53:43,773 --> 00:53:45,764
Connect all the names into one.

708
00:53:46,013 --> 00:53:48,049
Dot no I's, cross no T's.

709
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:50,608
Fold it twice and put it in your pocket.

710
00:53:54,973 --> 00:53:56,088
Get a picture.

711
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:59,052
Sew up the mouth with dove's blood.

712
00:53:59,293 --> 00:54:00,442
Blacken the eyes.

713
00:54:00,693 --> 00:54:02,729
Now go!
I got works to do.

714
00:54:06,693 --> 00:54:07,728
Boy!

715
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,331
Take these words to heart.

716
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,483
To understand the living...

717
00:54:14,813 --> 00:54:17,281
...you got to commune with the dead.

718
00:54:20,613 --> 00:54:21,523
Now go!

719
00:54:21,773 --> 00:54:23,570
And don't you dare look back!

720
00:54:53,613 --> 00:54:54,966
On the grave...

721
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,971
Who is Dr. Buzzard?

722
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:59,209
Minerva was married to Dr. Buzzard...

723
00:54:59,453 --> 00:55:02,843
...the foremost voodoo practitioner
in Beaufort County.

724
00:55:03,093 --> 00:55:05,891
You may not know it,
but you are deep in voodoo country.

725
00:55:06,653 --> 00:55:08,962
I don't believe
in the hocus-pocus of it...

726
00:55:09,213 --> 00:55:11,602
...but the spiritual force behind it.

727
00:55:12,213 --> 00:55:15,011
The shiny dimes were easy...

728
00:55:15,253 --> 00:55:17,926
...but the virgin water
was a trick or two.

729
00:55:18,573 --> 00:55:21,451
How do you know she wouldn't know
the difference if it was tap water?

730
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:24,404
Not by looking or taste...

731
00:55:24,653 --> 00:55:27,451
...but she would've known
in an instant by looking at my face.

732
00:55:32,573 --> 00:55:33,767
I think...

733
00:55:34,013 --> 00:55:36,811
...the photo-doctoring
is going to be good therapy.

734
00:55:38,933 --> 00:55:41,401
What about the pleas
for daily forgiveness?

735
00:55:42,653 --> 00:55:46,532
No, I don't think that's
going to be happening. Definitely not.

736
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:55,846
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

737
00:55:57,173 --> 00:55:58,572
- Hey, you.
- How are you?

738
00:55:58,813 --> 00:55:59,962
- How you doing?
- Good.

739
00:56:00,213 --> 00:56:01,168
You work here?

740
00:56:01,653 --> 00:56:03,325
What you see is what you get.

741
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:04,801
Nothing wrong with that.

742
00:56:05,053 --> 00:56:06,566
Gee, thanks.

743
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:26,561
These are nice.

744
00:56:27,013 --> 00:56:29,004
You want to send some flowers?

745
00:56:30,133 --> 00:56:32,283
I think so.
I don't know, though.

746
00:56:32,533 --> 00:56:34,012
It's kind of complicated.

747
00:56:34,613 --> 00:56:35,887
For whom?

748
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:38,007
What's she like?

749
00:56:38,253 --> 00:56:40,005
I don't know her that well.

750
00:56:40,253 --> 00:56:41,447
Roses are a favorite.

751
00:56:41,693 --> 00:56:43,604
A bit presumptuous.

752
00:56:43,853 --> 00:56:45,172
How about...

753
00:56:45,413 --> 00:56:46,289
...poinsettias?

754
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:48,842
Perennials might
give the wrong impression.

755
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:52,411
- Too long-term?
- Yeah, it's hard to say.

756
00:56:52,653 --> 00:56:54,564
This is complicated.

757
00:56:55,373 --> 00:56:56,806
How about petunias?

758
00:56:57,053 --> 00:57:00,841
They're pretty without
being presumptuous, smell nice...

759
00:57:01,093 --> 00:57:02,924
...and in 3 days you throw them out.

760
00:57:03,613 --> 00:57:05,365
Sound like what you're looking for?

761
00:57:09,533 --> 00:57:11,763
Sorry, we're all out of petunias.

762
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,929
Come on, get up, Lewis.
Get up.

763
00:57:26,973 --> 00:57:28,247
Get on up.

764
00:57:29,853 --> 00:57:31,491
Good afternoon, Yankee John.

765
00:57:33,013 --> 00:57:35,766
That sounds like a dead battery.

766
00:57:40,653 --> 00:57:43,247
Woman that owns the tour company
rear-ended me...

767
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:44,846
...so to speak.

768
00:57:45,093 --> 00:57:46,367
Where we headed?

769
00:57:48,613 --> 00:57:50,444
How about live entertainment?

770
00:57:51,693 --> 00:57:52,921
Get on up, Lewis.

771
00:57:53,173 --> 00:57:54,925
That's a good horse.

772
00:57:55,173 --> 00:57:56,401
Hey. Bitch!

773
00:57:56,653 --> 00:57:57,972
Hey, bitch!

774
00:57:58,333 --> 00:58:02,121
Let the house say it like you mean it.
Let the house say, "Hey, bitch!"

775
00:58:02,373 --> 00:58:03,965
Hey, bitch!

776
00:58:04,653 --> 00:58:07,213
Yes, I am a bitch,
and proud of it, honey.

777
00:58:07,453 --> 00:58:11,492
Your mama is just sweating. I'm putting
a sweating in front of you white folks.

778
00:58:11,733 --> 00:58:16,363
But then again, I want you all to know
how hard a girl is working for you.

779
00:58:16,613 --> 00:58:18,683
Excuse me, darling.

780
00:58:19,693 --> 00:58:20,682
Excuse me.

781
00:58:20,933 --> 00:58:21,809
Oh, my God!

782
00:58:22,053 --> 00:58:25,682
"Oh, my God," nothing, honey.
"Oh, my empress" is what you should say.

783
00:58:25,933 --> 00:58:28,686
Y'all been necking
since I walked out on stage.

784
00:58:29,093 --> 00:58:33,371
Look, our lvory Soap-using girl.
Love them kind of bitches, baby.

785
00:58:33,613 --> 00:58:37,208
Either he got some good old stuff,
girl, or you horny as hell.

786
00:58:40,253 --> 00:58:42,209
Is this your boyfriend?
Your husband?

787
00:58:42,533 --> 00:58:43,761
My husband.

788
00:58:44,173 --> 00:58:45,970
What does Mr. Man do for a living?

789
00:58:46,453 --> 00:58:47,806
He's a doctor.

790
00:58:48,053 --> 00:58:49,042
A doctor?

791
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:53,684
You better grow you some nails, because
if he's a gynecologist, he's mine.

792
00:58:54,413 --> 00:58:55,892
I am serious, honey.

793
00:58:57,053 --> 00:59:01,683
He is mine. A doctor. Grow your nails,
I'm going to take him away from you.

794
00:59:04,093 --> 00:59:07,369
Look at him just blushing.
You're so cute.

795
00:59:07,613 --> 00:59:09,444
You want to give me a physical?

796
00:59:11,533 --> 00:59:13,763
I have nothing to hide.

797
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:19,808
You better have American Express, baby.

798
00:59:20,053 --> 00:59:22,248
But you know what?
That's okay about him.

799
00:59:22,493 --> 00:59:25,212
Because the Doll has already got
some white boy...

800
00:59:25,453 --> 00:59:27,364
...running after her good old stuff.

801
00:59:27,613 --> 00:59:30,844
Spotlight, shine a spotlight over there.
Right over there.

802
00:59:31,093 --> 00:59:34,244
You see that fine white man right there?
That one, there.

803
00:59:34,493 --> 00:59:38,805
He has been running the Doll
all around Savannah trying to get some.

804
00:59:39,053 --> 00:59:42,409
First day I met him,
he brought the girl roses.

805
00:59:42,653 --> 00:59:44,086
Then again, as you well know...

806
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:46,608
...ain't nothing too good for the Doll.

807
00:59:46,853 --> 00:59:50,402
Ain't nothing too good for the Lady.
I am serious about that.

808
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:54,168
If I catch any of you bitches
near him, honey...

809
00:59:54,413 --> 00:59:58,088
...I want you to know you'll have
to deal with the Lady Chablis...

810
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:01,689
...the Doll, the Grand Empress,
and my motherfucking ice pick.

811
01:00:02,293 --> 01:00:04,170
So keep your hands off of that one.

812
01:00:06,813 --> 01:00:07,962
Hey, honey love.

813
01:00:08,213 --> 01:00:09,328
How are you, Doll?

814
01:00:09,813 --> 01:00:12,168
I'm fine.
Who is that handsome man?

815
01:00:12,973 --> 01:00:13,849
Joe Odom.

816
01:00:14,053 --> 01:00:15,042
Pleased to meet you.

817
01:00:15,293 --> 01:00:18,490
My pleasure. We met before.
We slept together one night.

818
01:00:18,733 --> 01:00:23,249
Narrow it down for the Doll. There are
certain nights I cannot remember.

819
01:00:23,493 --> 01:00:25,245
That's another tale for another time.

820
01:00:26,253 --> 01:00:30,724
My ice cubes are getting a bit dry.
I'll leave you two alone. Ma'am.

821
01:00:30,973 --> 01:00:34,568
Thank you. I'll talk to you later,
you sentimental gentleman.

822
01:00:34,813 --> 01:00:35,848
Hurry back.

823
01:00:36,493 --> 01:00:39,087
Don't let him hurry back.
I need to spend time with you.

824
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:40,209
How are you?

825
01:00:40,453 --> 01:00:44,412
I'm fine, honey. Still hiding my candy.
Want me to unwrap it for you?

826
01:00:44,653 --> 01:00:46,325
- You don't have to.
- You sure?

827
01:00:46,573 --> 01:00:47,801
Not yet.
I mean, not ever.

828
01:00:48,053 --> 01:00:49,725
- It's a small little wrapper.
- Please.

829
01:00:49,973 --> 01:00:51,122
Like a Tootsie Roll.

830
01:00:51,373 --> 01:00:52,852
Some people don't need to see candy.

831
01:00:54,213 --> 01:00:57,250
Okay, that's fine.
But I got something to tell you.

832
01:00:57,493 --> 01:01:02,123
I got something to tell you.
I have boyfriend number four.

833
01:01:02,373 --> 01:01:03,522
Really?

834
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:07,129
A tall, blond hunk of a hunk of man.

835
01:01:07,373 --> 01:01:10,092
He's a mechanic on Abercorn Street.
Know where that is?

836
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,405
- I know where that is.
- Treats me like a queen.

837
01:01:13,813 --> 01:01:15,565
No pun intended.
None whatsoever.

838
01:01:17,253 --> 01:01:20,723
You must promise if you
ever meet him, which I doubt you will...

839
01:01:20,973 --> 01:01:23,771
...if you should meet him,
you must never tell him my "T."

840
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,526
- He has no idea.
- Your "T"?

841
01:01:25,773 --> 01:01:27,604
You know, my "T," my truth.

842
01:01:27,853 --> 01:01:29,411
The hide-my-candy thing.

843
01:01:29,933 --> 01:01:33,608
He doesn't know,
so you mustn't say anything.

844
01:01:34,373 --> 01:01:36,887
- Promise me you won't.
- Don't you think he'll find out?

845
01:01:37,133 --> 01:01:39,693
When I'm ready for him to find out,
he'll find out.

846
01:01:39,973 --> 01:01:41,691
Like when I was ready for you
to find out.

847
01:01:41,933 --> 01:01:43,685
But I wasn't looking for your candy.

848
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:45,252
But you was smelling for it.

849
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:48,087
- I did not smell your candy.
- Why are you here?

850
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:49,527
I want to interview you.

851
01:01:50,213 --> 01:01:51,532
Your show was terrific.

852
01:01:51,773 --> 01:01:53,570
Thank you.
You want to interview me?

853
01:01:53,813 --> 01:01:55,326
Yes, very much so.

854
01:02:11,053 --> 01:02:11,963
What happened?

855
01:02:12,213 --> 01:02:14,204
9 jurors indicted murder one.

856
01:02:14,453 --> 01:02:16,808
They're trying to put our friend away
for life.

857
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:23,728
Your Honor...

858
01:02:24,053 --> 01:02:26,965
...the community that put us both
in the positions we now hold...

859
01:02:27,213 --> 01:02:31,092
...would be less than pleased with
an order allowing a wealthy defendant...

860
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:33,767
...in a first-degree murder case bail.

861
01:02:34,373 --> 01:02:35,852
And they'd be right.

862
01:02:39,853 --> 01:02:41,127
All right, gentlemen.

863
01:02:41,453 --> 01:02:44,445
I have listened carefully
to these arguments.

864
01:02:44,693 --> 01:02:49,084
Mr. Williams is charged
with a very violent crime...

865
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:52,291
...and Mr. Seiler, I can't grant bail
under these circumstances.

866
01:02:53,973 --> 01:02:56,487
But I will put this case
on a fast track...

867
01:02:56,933 --> 01:02:58,161
...for a speedy trial.

868
01:02:58,453 --> 01:02:59,602
That's all.

869
01:03:12,053 --> 01:03:15,887
Well, sport, looks like there might be
a book in this after all.

870
01:03:22,493 --> 01:03:25,769
Does he have any idea
how serious this is?

871
01:03:26,013 --> 01:03:28,368
You know it and I know it...

872
01:03:29,533 --> 01:03:32,172
...and after tonight,
damn hell, so will he.

873
01:03:43,013 --> 01:03:43,889
What is it?

874
01:03:44,133 --> 01:03:47,762
You told Sonny I heard Billy
threaten you the night you shot him.

875
01:03:48,573 --> 01:03:50,928
I heard you threaten him too.
If I testify...

876
01:03:51,173 --> 01:03:52,162
I didn't threaten him.

877
01:03:52,413 --> 01:03:53,448
I warned him.

878
01:03:54,253 --> 01:03:57,131
He had a history of violence.
He was drunk and high.

879
01:03:57,453 --> 01:04:00,251
While trespassing,
he profanely demanded money...

880
01:04:00,493 --> 01:04:02,768
...and brandished
a broken bottle in my face.

881
01:04:03,013 --> 01:04:04,890
Is that not your recollection as well?

882
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:08,523
- More or less.
- Then your testimony can only help me.

883
01:04:11,933 --> 01:04:14,049
What was it between the two of you?

884
01:04:17,693 --> 01:04:18,648
We'll turn this off.

885
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:21,291
I don't mind that.

886
01:04:27,053 --> 01:04:28,532
Was it just sex?

887
01:04:29,093 --> 01:04:31,402
Tell me about the relationship.

888
01:04:36,893 --> 01:04:39,566
Billy and I had a bond.

889
01:04:39,813 --> 01:04:42,407
That's not something
they're going to understand.

890
01:04:43,493 --> 01:04:45,245
They'll just see the sex...

891
01:04:45,493 --> 01:04:47,245
...and the age difference.

892
01:04:48,813 --> 01:04:51,407
But Billy was going to make something
of himself.

893
01:04:53,133 --> 01:04:55,203
Great things, great people...

894
01:04:56,773 --> 01:04:59,446
...can come from humble beginnings.

895
01:04:59,693 --> 01:05:01,684
He needed what I gave him...

896
01:05:03,693 --> 01:05:05,684
...and I needed what he gave me.

897
01:05:08,253 --> 01:05:10,721
Now, do you wish
to pass judgement on that?

898
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:12,602
No.

899
01:05:15,133 --> 01:05:16,612
I'm innocent, John.

900
01:05:17,853 --> 01:05:19,809
It's important that you believe that.

901
01:05:20,933 --> 01:05:22,525
Do you believe that?

902
01:05:24,653 --> 01:05:26,086
Yes, I do.

903
01:05:30,053 --> 01:05:32,772
I'm having trouble
getting anyone to talk to me.

904
01:05:34,573 --> 01:05:36,086
I'll make some arrangements.

905
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:39,928
Tomorrow, can you bring the Sotheby's
and Christie's catalogues?

906
01:05:40,173 --> 01:05:43,563
They serve dinner here at 7,
so that's when we'll make our calls.

907
01:05:45,253 --> 01:05:46,572
Our calls?

908
01:05:55,693 --> 01:05:57,729
Yes, accept the charges, operator.

909
01:05:59,853 --> 01:06:01,730
Jim. How are you?

910
01:06:02,533 --> 01:06:05,206
All right, sport,
let's give this a try, shall we?

911
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:08,085
Let's see if we can work this.

912
01:06:23,453 --> 01:06:24,772
All right, it's ringing.

913
01:06:27,053 --> 01:06:31,046
Hello, Jim Williams calling
for Geza von Habsburg.

914
01:06:32,053 --> 01:06:33,008
Thank you.

915
01:06:34,013 --> 01:06:34,968
Thank you.

916
01:06:39,093 --> 01:06:39,969
Geza.

917
01:06:40,493 --> 01:06:43,291
James! How nice of you to call.

918
01:06:43,533 --> 01:06:46,252
Would you be interested
in my Maximilian desk?

919
01:06:49,493 --> 01:06:51,085
Someone, ask him to be quiet.

920
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:58,326
It sounds like your dog
doesn't want to sell. What's his breed?

921
01:07:00,293 --> 01:07:02,568
That's a Russian wolfhound.

922
01:07:04,093 --> 01:07:05,651
Sounds more like a Shar-Pei.

923
01:07:06,293 --> 01:07:09,012
No, no, that's my Yorkie.

924
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,967
Would someone please
put the dogs in the garden?

925
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:21,563
I'll take care of the dog for you.

926
01:07:23,853 --> 01:07:27,050
Now, Geza,
you know I'll want top dollar.

927
01:07:27,573 --> 01:07:29,131
As always.

928
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:32,368
Shut up!

929
01:08:14,813 --> 01:08:17,373
Is this the Married Women's Card Club?

930
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:19,167
Yes.

931
01:08:21,933 --> 01:08:23,685
Is anyone going to ring the doorbell?

932
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,605
Oh, heavens, no!

933
01:08:25,853 --> 01:08:28,970
We have very strict rules.
The door opens precisely at 4.

934
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:34,686
You all look lovely.

935
01:08:35,053 --> 01:08:36,406
Actually, Jim...

936
01:08:36,653 --> 01:08:39,531
...suggested
that I introduce you around.

937
01:08:39,773 --> 01:08:42,446
But if we could just keep that
between us...

938
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:45,683
- Why?
- Just a minute.

939
01:08:46,533 --> 01:08:48,171
Everything all right, ladies?

940
01:08:48,933 --> 01:08:49,922
Good.

941
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:53,528
Jim was a true friend to me
over the years.

942
01:08:53,773 --> 01:08:56,003
But most of these ladies
are still deciding...

943
01:08:56,253 --> 01:08:59,290
...how they'll respond
to this current predicament.

944
01:08:59,773 --> 01:09:00,922
You know...

945
01:09:01,173 --> 01:09:02,447
...the incident.

946
01:09:02,773 --> 01:09:05,970
I have work to do in the kitchen.
Would you like to take a seat?

947
01:09:06,213 --> 01:09:08,807
- I don't play bridge.
- Oh, I don't mean play.

948
01:09:09,093 --> 01:09:10,162
Men aren't allowed.

949
01:09:11,093 --> 01:09:12,765
Especially single men.

950
01:09:13,013 --> 01:09:16,050
But you could sit down and wait.
I'll be right back.

951
01:09:25,253 --> 01:09:28,006
It was a crime passionnel.
A lover's quarrel.

952
01:09:28,253 --> 01:09:31,450
That may be, but I gather
it's going to be rather sticky for Jim.

953
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:33,288
Really?

954
01:09:33,693 --> 01:09:37,129
There's no gunpowder on that boy's hand.
He didn't fire the gun...

955
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:38,965
...as Jim claims.

956
01:09:41,333 --> 01:09:43,847
And the location
of the bullet wounds...

957
01:09:44,093 --> 01:09:47,529
Seems to be at odds with
Mr. Williams' scenario of self-defense.

958
01:09:47,773 --> 01:09:48,603
How so?

959
01:09:48,853 --> 01:09:52,482
One entered the chest. The second
bullet hit the boy in the back.

960
01:09:52,733 --> 01:09:55,088
And the third, well,
the third bullet...

961
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:56,891
What do you think'll happen to Jim?

962
01:09:58,813 --> 01:10:00,724
It's difficult to say.

963
01:10:01,013 --> 01:10:05,404
Those who are happy Billy is no longer
burning rubber through the squares...

964
01:10:05,693 --> 01:10:07,968
...are the exact people who think...

965
01:10:08,213 --> 01:10:12,968
...that Jim picked a very unseemly way
to exit the closet...

966
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:14,448
...if you will.

967
01:10:15,013 --> 01:10:16,128
With a bang.

968
01:10:17,493 --> 01:10:18,926
Literally.

969
01:10:20,213 --> 01:10:21,168
And then...

970
01:10:21,413 --> 01:10:22,562
...there are the others.

971
01:10:23,133 --> 01:10:24,532
Tell me about the others.

972
01:10:25,373 --> 01:10:29,446
There's bound to be a certain
resentment about Jim killing that boy.

973
01:10:29,693 --> 01:10:32,287
That boy in particular, I mean.

974
01:10:33,013 --> 01:10:34,002
Why?

975
01:10:34,733 --> 01:10:37,770
Billy was a very accomplished hustler.

976
01:10:38,013 --> 01:10:40,811
By all accounts,
very good at his trade...

977
01:10:41,053 --> 01:10:45,046
...and very much appreciated
by both men and women.

978
01:10:46,733 --> 01:10:48,007
The trouble is...

979
01:10:48,253 --> 01:10:51,006
...he hadn't finished
making the rounds, no.

980
01:10:51,933 --> 01:10:54,128
Billy Hanson was known to be...

981
01:10:54,373 --> 01:10:55,886
...a good time...

982
01:10:56,133 --> 01:10:57,168
...but...

983
01:10:57,413 --> 01:11:00,803
...a good time not yet had by all.

984
01:11:01,253 --> 01:11:05,087
They're saying Jim Williams killed
the best piece of ass in Savannah.

985
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:06,482
- Is that true?
- I don't know.

986
01:11:06,733 --> 01:11:08,928
You know about ass in Savannah.
What do you think?

987
01:11:09,173 --> 01:11:11,050
Great God!

988
01:11:11,773 --> 01:11:15,732
Good gossip's hard currency in this
town. Folks just paying their bills.

989
01:11:15,973 --> 01:11:20,285
When the chips are down,
they'll be there for Jim. Trust me.

990
01:11:20,533 --> 01:11:23,331
- Rather hear your legal strategies.
- Our game plan's still percolating.

991
01:11:23,573 --> 01:11:26,406
We had a deal.
I've shared every bit of information...

992
01:11:26,653 --> 01:11:27,972
Come along in.

993
01:11:28,213 --> 01:11:30,090
Now, don't mind us.

994
01:11:34,573 --> 01:11:35,688
Trial date.

995
01:11:36,093 --> 01:11:38,129
Big game 3 weeks from now.

996
01:11:38,373 --> 01:11:39,488
It's a shootout.

997
01:11:39,853 --> 01:11:42,048
Both teams got one silver bullet.

998
01:11:42,533 --> 01:11:45,366
Gunshot residue test, that's theirs.

999
01:11:45,813 --> 01:11:46,000
No gunshot residue on Billy's hands
means he didn't fire.
