1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,755
Here he comes.

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,554
Terry Haslam.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,228
Who does he think he is?
Joe Bugner?

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,189
<i>Court Number Three
is now in session.</i>

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,749
<i>The Crown versus Haslam.</i>

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,591
Mr Mackay. As you have already said,

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,309
the boxing match in question
was an extremely fierce one.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,995
So hard-fought, in fact, you injured
your hand seriously enough

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,754
to require medical attention
following the bout.

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,797
- Is that true?
- Aye.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,748
Would it also be true to say that
it was your manager, Mr Haslam,

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,831
the man you called
your second father,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,231
who ensured you received
that treatment in timely fashion?

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,435
It would.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,513
And that treatment is what you were
discussing with Mr Haslam

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,432
on the fire escape outside the hall

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,398
when you unfortunately
lost your footing,

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,870
slipped and fell down the stairs,
causing further injury?

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,109
Aye.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,510
He did not push you?

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,674
No. It was an accident.
Mr Haslam was trying to help me.

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,876
I swear by Almighty God

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,156
that the evidence I shall give

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,792
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,475
Good afternoon, Chief Inspector.
As we have heard,

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,953
Mr Mackay says he was the victim of
no more than an unfortunate accident.

27
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,032
Bearing in mind you were,
by your own admission,

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,830
"slightly intoxicated" and at least
20 yards away at the time,

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,676
can you confirm that what
you witnessed was an accident?

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,397
Mr Hunt?

31
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,072
I know what you'd like me to say.

32
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,198
But I know what I saw.
And what I saw

33
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,715
was him

34
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,714
kicking seven types of shit
out of him.

35
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,878
Do you find this defendant
guilty or not guilty

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,315
of inflicting grievous bodily harm?

37
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,199
- Not guilty.
- Yes!

38
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,670
You are joking me!

39
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,274
Order! Order!

40
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,635
The jury was nobbled.

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,315
Well, if the victim suddenly decides
it was all an unhappy accident,

42
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,948
what do you expect them to do?

43
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,031
What happened, Davie?

44
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,475
You got it all wrong.

45
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,160
I saw you destroy a man's life.

46
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,595
I made him. I broke him.

47
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,832
He's not the first
and he won't be the last.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,116
- I'll bloody kill you.
- Have your go.

49
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,874
Come on. Walk away.

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,034
Broke his hand. Broke his life.

51
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,997
No, no, no, no.

52
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,549
No, he broke his soul.

53
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,030
- I'll drive you home.
- Gimme the ruddy keys.

54
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,191
No. You're drunk.

55
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,593
Stop! Stop.

56
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,955
- This is it.
- You sure?

57
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,996
- Haslam!
- Oi, Guv!

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,990
- You arse-faced bastard!
- Guv?

59
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,958
- Show us your face!
- Will you keep your voice down?

60
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,554
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What you doing?

61
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,551
- Haslam!
- Bloody hell.

62
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,950
- Put that away. Put that away!
- Come on out!

63
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,680
Put it away. Put it away! Come on.

64
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,877
I'll have you! Bastard!

65
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,190
Behave yourself.

66
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,239
Hunt! I'll break your legs,
you bastard! Get here!

67
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,437
- Haslam!
- Bastard! Bastard!

68
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,195
Get out the car! Bastard!

69
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,875
Bring you down next time,
you bent bastard!

70
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,395
- What the hell was all that about?
- Stop the car.

71
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,152
- What?
- Stop the car!

72
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,436
Why?

73
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,238
- I dropped my gun.
- What?

74
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,231
I've dropped my gun.

75
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,868
Where you going now? Guv!

76
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,875
- Gene. Gene!
- Why don't you just piss off?

77
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,071
<i>- Hello?
- He'll come to you.</i>

78
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,514
<i>He'll ask for your help.</i>

79
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,159
<i>- Hello?
- Sam?</i>

80
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,515
Guv.

81
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,478
<i>- What do you want?
- I, um...</i>

82
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,552
<i>I appear to have killed a man.</i>

83
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,437
<i>My name is Sam Tyler.</i>

84
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,068
<i>I had an accident
and I woke up in 1973.</i>

85
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,949
<i>Am I mad, in a coma, or back in time?</i>

86
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,669
<i>Whatever's happened,
it's like I've landed on a different planet.</i>

87
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,037
<i>Now, maybe if I can work out
the reason, I can get home.</i>

88
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,550
Well, at least he got
what he deserved. Fat bastard.

89
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,915
What happened?

90
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,638
I don't know.

91
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,709
I don't.

92
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,030
I woke up over there.

93
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,432
He was the first thing I saw,
which gave me a bit of a turn.

94
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,917
- How did you get here?
- I don't know.

95
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,914
The last thing I remember
is taking a swing for you in the pub.

96
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,355
Look, I know it looks bad.

97
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,080
Well, that's
the understatement of the century.

98
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,879
You may remember
threatening the victim's life

99
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,713
in front of a dozen or so witnesses.
At the courthouse?

100
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,553
- I didn't kill him.
- How did you get here?

101
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,712
- I don't know.
- Great

102
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,755
- Where's your gun?
- What?

103
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,673
Your gun. Where's your gun?

104
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,150
You were waving it about like Charles
Bronson on crack a few hours ago.

105
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,869
You went back for it. Where is it?

106
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,393
- I don't know.
- OK...

107
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,518
- You woke up here?
- Yeah.

108
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,716
It's been fired.

109
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,509
Oh, shit.

110
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,712
You know they're
going to have to arrest you.

111
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,075
So why did you call me?

112
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,398
Because if this goes the way
it looks like it's going,

113
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,551
I want you to lead the investigation.

114
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,358
You need my help?

115
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,559
Just be the picky pain in the arse
you usually are, and I shall be fine.

116
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,109
Get me out, Sam.

117
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,274
- What's happening?
- What's happening with the Guv?

118
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,793
- Wait.
- He can't have killed anybody.

119
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,872
- He hasn't been charged yet.
- It's got to be a mistake.

120
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,838
- There's no way...
- He can't have been that drunk.

121
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,037
He was hammered.
And he did threaten the victim.

122
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,749
Look, I'm not saying he did it,
but it looks bad.

123
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,435
But looks aren't enough
to hang anyone.

124
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,110
As the man said,
it's the evidence that counts.

125
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,475
And you are?

126
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,393
Frank Morgan. Acting DCI.

127
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,756
As your boss currently languishes
in a holding cell on a murder charge,

128
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,638
the powers that be have replaced him,

129
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,349
albeit temporarily,
I'm sure we all hope, with me.

130
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,353
Far as you're concerned,
for the immediate future,

131
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,512
I am the word and the law.

132
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,194
- DI Tyler?
- Um... yeah.

133
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,918
Good.

134
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,117
You must be DC Cartwright.

135
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,794
DS Carling. DC Skelton.

136
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,873
We'll start with one-on-ones in my
office, please, which would be...?

137
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,554
Er... I don't...

138
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,873
Well, I imagine it would be that one.

139
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,996
Good.

140
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,396
Let's kick off, shall we?

141
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,038
Fine.

142
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,508
You were first on scene?

143
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,511
I was.

144
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,636
Good.

145
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,917
Why did he call you?

146
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,754
Well, I suppose he trusts me.

147
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,716
Just as it should be.

148
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,518
- Sir.
- Did he do it?

149
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,558
Without the postmortem and forensics,

150
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,154
I'm not prepared to make
a judgement on that.

151
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,515
Gut feeling?

152
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,112
No.

153
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,033
Whatever he is, he's not a killer.

154
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,918
Well, let's see
where the evidence takes us.

155
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,310
I'll lead the first interview.

156
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,789
I'll bring him up.

157
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,269
Thanks, Sam.

158
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,637
I'm sure everything
will go as it should.

159
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,192
What did he say, boss?
What's he like?

160
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,274
Well, he seems very professional.

161
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,396
Bastard. That's all we need.

162
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,198
Well, yeah, Ray.

163
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,999
Under the circumstances,
I think it probably is.

164
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,869
- He's doing an overview, isn't he?
- Yes, Chris, I think he is.

165
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,112
Did you get that from him,
or did he get that from you?

166
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,555
- What do you mean?
- He's from Hyde, isn't he?

167
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,518
And we all know
what they're like. Don't we?

168
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,514
Actually, I've never had the pleasure
of meeting your DI.

169
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,433
Carling, when you're ready?

170
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,519
Well, come on then, twinkletoes.
Strut your stuff.

171
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,479
Acting DCI Morgan
will be conducting the interview.

172
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,119
Who?

173
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,793
He's from Hyde.

174
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,394
Oh, great

175
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,358
- What's he like?
- I've only just met him myself.

176
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,511
So how are we going to deal with him?

177
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,829
- Deal with him?
- Mm.

178
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,434
He leads the investigation.
There are no deals.

179
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,194
Oh, come on. Where's the picky pain?

180
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,157
Look...

181
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,869
I will ensure this investigation
is carried out in as transparent...

182
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,669
I don't want see-through.
I want fast.

183
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,435
You are a murder suspect.

184
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,953
We can't give you the keys

185
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,829
and say, "Just put them through
the letterbox when you're done."

186
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,831
- Get me out.
- I can't.

187
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,673
No, no, what you mean is you won't.

188
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,156
Talk to Davie Mackay.

189
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,993
- Why?
- You were in court yesterday.

190
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,549
Now, you know as well as I do

191
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,154
that something smelt bad
about the whole thing.

192
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,117
And it wasn't just your aftershave.

193
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,636
- Look, why should I?
- I see you've already started.

194
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,038
Oh, fuck.

195
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,239
- You're taping the interview?
- Should be standard practice.

196
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,674
I find it keeps everyone honest.

197
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,389
July 17th, 1973.

198
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,759
Present at interview: DCI Frank
Morgan, DI Sam Tyler, DCI Gene Hunt.

199
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,793
Two bullets
retrieved from Haslam's house.

200
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,951
Same calibre as police issue.

201
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,272
DCI Hunt's clothing.
Stained with blood.

202
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,955
Witness statement from a neighbour
woken by "bellowing and cursing".

203
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,114
She looked out of her window
to see this man

204
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,556
throwing a brick through the victim's
window around midnight.

205
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,272
She was woken again by shouting
from the same man at 3.30am.

206
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,035
Based on body temperature,

207
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,079
the pathologist's report
puts time of death at 4.00am.

208
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,275
Does he?

209
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,954
I understand that you claim to have
no memory at all

210
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,635
of any of events between leaving
the Railway Arms at 11.30 last night

211
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,951
and waking up in the victim's house
at half past seven this morning.

212
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,712
Right.

213
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,792
Quite a lot to forget,
don't you think?

214
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,429
- You all right, Guv?
- Never been better.

215
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,114
It's a fit-up, Guv. It's obvious.

216
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,111
Obvious.

217
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,238
Remember the picky pain, Sam.

218
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,755
What do you think?

219
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,391
It's not what I think that matters,
is it? It's what we find.

220
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,030
I'm looking for Davie Mackay.

221
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,871
Police.

222
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,389
- What is it?
- Terry Haslam's dead.

223
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,435
Aye. I heard.

224
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,920
You were lying,
weren't you, in court?

225
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,390
It wasn't an accident, was it?
Haslam beat you up.

226
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,960
I suppose it does nae matter now, eh?

227
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,589
Aye. He hit me. Did this.

228
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,548
- Why?
- Had it coming.

229
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,836
How?

230
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,473
It's no easy life, boxing.
You sacrifice a lot.

231
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,119
It was my last fight.
Legs had gone. I knew it.

232
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,476
Once your legs have gone...

233
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,716
I needed a payday.

234
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,396
Mr Haslam set me up with a good bout.
Second on the bill, decent money.

235
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,437
Out with a bang.

236
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,114
Even a win wasn't enough.

237
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,714
Decent cash wasn't enough.

238
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,392
I stole from him.

239
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,757
Broke into his office
after the fight.

240
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,320
Broke his heart.

241
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,358
So he broke my hand.

242
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,478
I let him down. Had it coming.

243
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,949
What money?

244
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,955
What money did you steal?

245
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,396
All I knew was Pete and Mr Haslam

246
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,109
kept their cash
in a money box in the office.

247
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,599
Pete who?

248
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,830
Pete Wilkes.

249
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,953
My trainer.

250
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,599
With all due respect,
Mr Merrick...

251
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,436
Yeah. Given that you've not yet
charged my esteemed client,

252
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,831
I don't see how you've had the brass
to hold him as long as you have.

253
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,673
I think I've explained
we're awaiting further testimony

254
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,116
before sending the case to Discipline
and Complaints for a decision.

255
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,872
That's hardly my client's problem.

256
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,033
Oh, with the very greatest respect,
Detective Chief Inspector,

257
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,714
put up or shut up.

258
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,030
Considering the nature
of the offence...

259
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,555
# No more shall they in bondage toil

260
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,269
- And... and the fact...
- # Let my people go

261
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,078
Taking into consideration...

262
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,949
# Go down, Moses

263
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,998
# Go down, down to Egypt land

264
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,550
# Tell old Pharaoh

265
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,598
# Let my people go... aaah! #

266
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,518
In spite of your
inappropriate behaviour,

267
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,238
under the circumstances,

268
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,552
I am willing to release DCI Hunt
on police bail.

269
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,835
- On condition...
- Condition?

270
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,594
<i>...he reports to the police...
- Conditions?</i>

271
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,151
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

272
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,151
Conditions?

273
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,675
I'm fine, I'm fine.

274
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,838
Come on, lovely lad. We're done.

275
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,709
D'you know,
there were moments in that cell

276
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,509
when I despaired
I'd ever see your lovely face again.

277
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,355
It's a pleasure
doing business with you.

278
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,671
- You know where to find me.
- Come on.

279
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,748
Yeah, the nearest sewer.

280
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,149
He got me out.

281
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,273
- You seen Davie Mackay yet?
- Yeah.

282
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,716
His fighting days were over
well before he got his hand broken.

283
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,996
He decided to help himself
to a retirement package

284
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,628
from a cash box in the boxing club.

285
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,631
Davie robbed from Haslam?

286
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,759
Haslam and a guy called Pete Wilkes.
Davie's trainer.

287
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,797
- Do you know him?
- No.

288
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,436
How come you were there
the night Haslam broke Davie's hand?

289
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,397
Went to see the fight.

290
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,076
Davie was past his prime, but, er...
if you wanted to see a real fighter,

291
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,357
spit and blood, balls like a buffalo,
he was your man.

292
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,397
Let me know what you find.

293
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,838
- Why should I do that?
- 'Cause we're both coppers. Keys.

294
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,678
- Keep DCI Hunt under surveillance.
- What?

295
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,308
We know what he's capable of.

296
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,629
I wouldn't want our witnesses

297
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,997
experiencing his more abrupt
methods of persuasion.

298
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,957
You're joking, aren't you?

299
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,671
Well, unless you think this suspect
deserves special treatment...

300
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,831
- No, but you can't...
- Good.

301
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,878
Look, I know
it's not a very pleasant job,

302
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,749
but I'm sure you two will do it
to the best of your abilities.

303
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,913
We need to rebuild public confidence
in the police force.

304
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,277
An efficient investigation is
one way, public relations is another.

305
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,829
What?

306
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,149
Nothing. I just...

307
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,471
I never thought I'd hear the phrase
"public relations" in this room.

308
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,232
Well, with PR in mind,

309
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,552
I have a very special assignment
for DC Cartwright.

310
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,712
Hearts and minds, Annie.
Hearts and minds.

311
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,352
Road bloody safety.

312
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,718
Well, you know, this case...

313
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,237
it could get messy, so...
probably better off out of it.

314
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,392
Well, thanks for your support,
Inspector.

315
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,432
- Ray's right, isn't he?
- What do you mean?

316
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,989
You're both from Hyde.

317
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,828
Oi.

318
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,516
Sam?

319
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,552
I might have turned up
a very interesting line of enquiry.

320
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,153
Really?

321
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,551
A man called Pete Wilkes.
He's the trainer at Haslam's.

322
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,472
Wilkes?

323
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,279
Great minds think alike.

324
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,237
Come on.

325
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,519
It's all coming together.

326
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,355
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr Wilkes.
Please, take a seat.

327
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,109
I thought I might...

328
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,558
No, I'm sure I can handle Mr Wilkes.
I think we're on the same track.

329
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,872
Why don't you check up on the others?
Show your face.

330
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,989
The latest nail in Hunt's coffin.

331

<i># Take me on a roller coaster...</i>

332
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,757
- What are you doing here?
- Visiting our erstwhile leader.

333
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,070
- Who?
- Has he left the house?

334
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,754
No. His, er...
his wife left about twelve.

335
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,309
- At least we think it's his wife.
- It was his wife.

336
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,711
- She's put weight on, then.
- She carries it well, though.

337
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,476
Hey, there's nothing wrong with a bit
of meat in the right places.

338
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,428
Are there any other movements
I should be aware of?

339
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,876
Dropped a couple of brown trout
in the bookie's khazi an hour ago.

340
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,033
Meter man called round. But he was
only there about five minutes.

341
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,473
Thank you.

342
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,358
No problem.

it is not acceptable to me!

Guv.

I've already spoken to your boss.

378
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,957
Yeah? Well, now, Mr Wilkes,
you can speak to me.

379
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,515
- Who owns this club?
- Terry Haslam.

380
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,150
- Now that Terry's dead?
- I don't know.

381
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,993
So control of this club
doesn't pass over to you?

382
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,993
I'm a trainer. I train fighters.

383
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,948
Terry was the businessman.
We made a good team. While it lasted.

384
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,872
Bob and weave, son, bob and weave!

385
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,712
Meaning what?

386
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,589
Meaning it's time for me
to join the pension queue.

387
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,036
How much money did you lose
when Davie Mackay stole that cash?

388
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,239
- Davie? What cash?
- From the money box in your office.

389
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,994
What? Nobody stole any money.

390
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,037
- Who are you covering for?
- No one stole any money.

391
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,112
- What was Haslam up to?
- Look, I told Inspector Morgan.

392
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,191
I don't know
what was in that envelope.

393
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,395
What envelope?

394
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,030
- Could have been holiday brochures.
- What envelope?

395
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,870
Night of Davie's last fight.
The night he had his accident.

396
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,235
Haslam came back here
while I was cleaning.

397
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,358
Gave me an envelope, asked me
to pass it on to Mr Hunt. I did.

398
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,351
You know Gene Hunt?

399
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,069
Oh, yeah.
He and Terry Haslam go way back.

400
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,357
Mr Hunt'd come down and watch
the odd training session.

401
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,798
He's more than just a fan. Got a good
eye for a fighter, has Mr Hunt.

402
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,556
- I bet he has.
- Watch his left. Come on! Move!

403
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,110
At the kerb, halt.

404
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,432
Look right, look left.

405
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,750
Look right again.

406
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,471
And if it's all clear, quick march!

407
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,398
Aren't you supposed to stop people
from getting knocked over?

408
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,348
- If you've just come for a laugh...
- No, I haven't, I haven't.

409
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,118
Well, why have you come here, then?

410
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,395
It's the Guv.

411
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,715
He said he never knew
Davie's trainer, Pete Wilkes.

412
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,471
Wilkes has known him for years.

413
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,877
He gave him an envelope
on the night of Davie's last fight.

414
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,429
An envelope from Haslam.

415
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,195
So you think Haslam paid Gene to keep
quiet about breaking Davie's hand?

416
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,158
He told me he'd stopped all that.

417
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,878
He swore he would never...

418
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,510
I knew something was going on,
you know, in that courtroom.

419
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,514
The way Gene and Haslam looked
at each other. Unspoken messages.

420
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,877
But Sam, Gene testified against him.

421
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,271
Maybe he didn't pay him enough.
I don't know.

422
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,748
But what I do know is,

423
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,388
Gene was on the take.

424
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,153
And it's wrong, it's all wrong.

425
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,788
Well, then he did it.

426
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,712
He crossed the line.

427
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,998
He killed a man. You always said
Gene didn't know when to stop.

428
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,515
I trusted him.

429
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,274
So did I. We all did.

430
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,757
You know, without trust,
you've got nothing.

431
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,876
Who am I supposed to believe in now?

432
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,554
<i>DI Tyler, come in.</i>

433
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,836
<i>- Where are you?
- Here, Phyllis.</i>

434
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,396
- What happened?
- Knockout in the fifth.

435
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,312
- Hunt.
- What?

436
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,436
No, I can't believe it.
He can't have done.

437
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,433
Hunt deliberately slipped your
less than effective surveillance.

438
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,876
We have two witnesses
who say he turned up here earlier

439
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,393
and argued with Wilkes.

440
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,916
Wilkes swore Hunt's relationship
with Haslam was antagonistic.

441
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,594
What is it you find
so hard to believe?

442
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,035
- Yeah, but...
- They saw him here!

443
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,275
Face it.

444
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,878
OK, gentlemen, shall we proceed?
Now get out there and find Gene Hunt!

445
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,751
<i>The best thing we can do,
the only thing we can do,</i>

is our job.

447
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,750
So we gather evidence,
we make our case and we bring him in.

448
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,956
Shut up.

449
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,710
- What I'm trying to say...
- I don't care.

450
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,678
So shut your sodding mouth.

451
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,278
- Ray...
- Sergeant Carling to you. Sir.

452
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,629
Don't do something
you might regret.

453
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,237
What I do regret
is the day you walked onto my beat.

454
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,518
Now, you might get to be my DCI,
but don't think for one minute

455
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,070
you'll be a tenth of the copper
Gene Hunt was.

456
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,548
You're a good policeman, sir.

457
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,755
You've taught me a lot.

458
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,911
But it won't be the same
without the Guv.

459
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,398
You took your time.

460
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,472
What are you doing?

461
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,200
I'm giving you up.

462
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,715
No, you're not.

463
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,757
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

464
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,716
- You killed somebody.
- No, I did not.

465
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,156
- I saw you in the boxing club.
- I needed to speak to Wilkes.

466
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,269
In the course of which you hung him
from the ropes and slit his throat.

467
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,590
What?

468
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,398
That's how they found him.

469
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,949
You told me you didn't know him.

470
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,749
I didn't do it, Sam. Neither of them.

471
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,115
Sam. I swear.

472
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,191
I swear to you
I did not kill those men.

473
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,749
Why should I believe you?

474
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,754
Because you trust me!
Like I trust you.

475
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,515
- Why did you need to talk to him?
- I thought he'd know who framed me.

476
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,319
And why on earth
would somebody want to do that?

477
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,517
Because I didn't do
what I was supposed to.

478
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,316
Terry Haslam dragged himself
out of the gutter

479
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,074
using his fists and his brain.

480
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,514
Earned the respect
of his fellow fighters.

481
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,831
People like Davie Mackay
would have died for him.

482
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,151
When it came to money,
he always had a few tasty sidelines.

483
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,392
And you took his hush money.

484
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,119
Ringside seats, meet the fighters.

485
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,191
- And then the odd tenner.
- Backhanders.

486
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,636
Perks. Part of the job.

487
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,156
Since when has looking the other way
become part of the job?

488
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,992
What really sticks in my gullet

489
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,038
Is that I put a stop to it,
all of it, months ago.

490
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,395
Oh, really?

491
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,074
Wilkes said he gave you an envelope.

492
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,789
Why else would you have gone
to the boxing club that night?

493
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,714
I went to see Davie's last fight.
Simple as that.

494
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,190
On the way out, I heard an argument,
and being a good copper,

495
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,272
I go and sort it out.

496
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,069
I see Haslam breaking Davie's hand,
shoving him down a fire escape.

497
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,597
Whatever he did, he didn't deserve
what Haslam dished him.

498
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,035
And inside that envelope
was a load of cash.

499
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,872
Oh, and, er... a little note.

500
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,713
"If you keep quiet,
I won't write to the Chief Constable

501
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,838
"telling him about
our little previous arrangement."

502
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,471
So Haslam blackmailed you
to get him off the GBH charge?

503
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,472
What made you change your mind?

504
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,871
A rare attack of "do the right thing".

505
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,079
Yeah, and then I wake up
to find Haslam staring back at me,

506
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,993
his blood all over the walls.

507
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,917
Go to Morgan.

508
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,548
If I go to Morgan, I go to jail.

509
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,073
Do not pass Go.

510
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,552
Do not pause to say farewell
to friends and family. No.

511
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,474
I didn't do it, Sam.

512
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,359
I swear on my life.

513
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,350
I know.

514
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,758
It's proving it that's the problem.
That's the hard thing.

515
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,474
<i>Don't shoot!</i>

516
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,868
<i>Tyler!</i>

517
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,996
<i>Sam! Help us!</i>

518
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,230
- No!
- What is it?

519
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,436
Aaagh! Jesus, what?

520
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,795
It was a dream. Just had a dream.

521
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,270
What I call a dream involves
Diana Dors and a bottle of chip oil.

522
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,910
Oh, no. That's what you call
a guilty conscience, my friend.

523
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,436
- What?
- The root of nightmares.

524
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,955
My conscience is clear,
thank you very much.

525
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,998
Whereas me, slept like a baby.

526
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,596
Oh. Aah.

527
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,515
Yeah, a 20-stone baby.
Burps, snores, farts.

528
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,713
I do NOT snore.

529
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,316
You know, the only fingerprints
on that gun were yours.

530
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,552
- What about footprints?
- No.

531
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,952
- On the glass, you know, broken...
- Broken window. No.

532
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:22,069
Well, you must have missed something
or I wouldn't be in this bloody mess.

533
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,754
I need to see the flat.

534
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,399
- The crime scene?
- Yeah.

535
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,394
Good look at the place might
kick-start the old mighty engine.

536
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,711
- Me brain.
- Oh.

537
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,911
So you want to do a reconstruction?

538
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,551
Well, if you want to over-complicate
the idea... Oh, sorry, course you do.

539
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,359
Well, we'd need the crime photos

540
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,478
that, um...
are locked away in Morgan...

541
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,553
- Your cabinet.
- Yes. My cabinet.

542
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,077
Which I just so happen
to have the keys for.

543
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,430
OK.

544
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,392
- I'm coming with you.
- What?

545
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,917
I need the smell of CID to get
the old investigative juices flowing.

546
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,469
Half the police force
is out looking for you.

547
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,791
- They won't look for me there.
- You're off your head, you are.

548
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,396
Look. You're not the one who'll have
to knit himself a new arsehole

549
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,109
after 25 years of male affection in prison
showers. I'm coming with you.

550
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,831
You won't get within a mile of CID
without being recognised.

551
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,229
Unless...

552
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,111
Come on.

553
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,475
- Leave it on.
- I'm bloody dying in there.

554
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,517
You will be dead if they catch us.

555
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,432
How bloody dare he?

556
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,792
You seen the state of this place?
Ridiculously neat.

557
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,752
Hold up, hold up.
They're coming back in.

558
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,797
Wait for it.

559
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,639
OK.

560
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,670
Sam.

561
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,239
Who's the big rat?

562
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,949
It's, er... it's that
training exercise for the WPCs.

563
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,758
Hearts and minds.

564
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,718
Good. Good.

565
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,110
Oh, anything new on Wilkes' murder?

566
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,512
Pretty straightforward, I think.
Find Hunt, we find the killer.

567
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,513
Last piece of the jigsaw, eh?

568
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,239
You know what?
My squirrel instinct tells me

569
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,392
he's even more of a bastard
than I first thought.

570
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,028
That's very perceptive.

571
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,589
For a rat.

572
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,278
Do you remember anything?

573
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,515
OK.

574
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,677
OK.

575
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,676
Quarter to twelve.

576
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,798
You put a brick through the window.

577
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,032
Haslam runs out, we drive off.

578
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,317
You jump out of the car
and stagger off looking for your gun.

579
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,675
Say... ten to twelve.

580
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,274
Yeah. You're not telling me
anything new here.

581
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,431
We're working it through.

582
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,593
We're looking for something
that might spark a memory.

583
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,798
Where did you go
after you got out of the car?

584
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,157
- Do you remember picking up the gun?
- No.

585
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,629
Did you come
straight back to Haslam's?

586
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,156
Did you have a kip,
trying to sleep it off?

587
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,153
Did you fall over? Cut yourself?
Did you kick a cat?

588
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,630
No. Not a sodding thing.

589
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,955
OK.

590
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,590
So you're next heard
heading towards the house at 3.30.

591
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,548
So let's say Haslam opens the door.

592
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,190
He sees you waving your gun about.

593
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,113
Runs straight in here.

594
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,511
Nowhere to hide
so he just backs into the corner...

595
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,353
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Why would I come in here?

596
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,670
Why not do him
as soon as he opened the door?

597
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,193
That's what I would do.

598
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,954
- Opens the door, bam. Show's over.
- It makes no difference.

599
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,429
- Yes, it does.
- No, it doesn't.

600
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,398
Your gun. Your prints on your gun.

601
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,678
- Haslam's blood on your shirt.
- You think I'm capable of murder?

602
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,912
- It doesn't matter what I think.
- I am not a killer!

603
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,719
- Prove it!
- I can't.

604
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,236
Where's those photographs?

605
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,436
Vision of the future.

606
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,433
It's a remote control.
It's not a magic bloody wand.

607
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,313
- He wouldn't have seen that.
- What?

608
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,358
The pathologist.
He wouldn't have seen it.

609
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,108
Red, blue.
Red it goes on, blue it goes off.

610
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,510
Doesn't go off
till two o'clock in the morning.

611
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,718
It's a heating vent.

612
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,678
The heating was on
until two o'clock in the morning

613
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,638
and Haslam's body was sitting
right on top of it.

614
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,870
- Click of the switch.
- Yeah, all right.

615
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,077
It's not exactly nanotechnology,
you know.

616
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,033
Right, OK.

617
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,351
The window was smashed,
it was a cold night.

618
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,556
Ambient temperature
would have been low.

619
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,669
Haslam's body was prevented
from cooling at the predicted rate.

620
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,798
The time of death is wrong.
He was killed earlier.

621
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,589
Haslam was killed hours before
that neighbour saw you coming back.

622
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,877
Click of the switch.
Vision of the future.

623
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,678
I'm trying to save your arse here

624
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,354
and all you can do
is go on about the shiny new toy.

625
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,557
Telly. Right?

626
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,119
Lots of tellies.

627
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,511
SWEET'S
"DONE ME WRONG ALL RIGHT")

628
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,559
Flick of the switch.
Vision of the future.

629
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,674
<i>I was stood here... swaying...</i>

630
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,991
Under the impression
for some considerable time

631
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,832
that I had multiple vision.

632
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,231
Dying for a slash. Bladder
the size of a bloody bowling ball.

633
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,118
It was there.

634
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,111
Oh, blessed relief.

635
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,317
Niagara bloody Falls, my friend.

636
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,870
- Then what?
- Then, um...

637
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,430
Oh, you coming in, or what?
You're blocking me passage.

638
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,239
Sorry, love.

639
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,994
- Oh, I might have known.
- Known what?

640
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,515
It took two bottles of bleach
and a can of Ajax

641
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,638
to get your stink
off that front step.

642
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,995
My stink off this front step?
You saw me here?

643
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,232
Saw you? I had to step over
your ruddy carcass.

644
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,075
You've a nerve coming back here.
He's like a dog to vomit.

645
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,038
<i>- Hold on, love...
- Me, I'd have left you there to rot.</i>

646
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,237
- That's what friends are for, eh?
- Friends? What friends?

647
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,358
Him that came and poured you
into the back of his van.

648
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,751
More fool bloody him. He were the one
that needed help, poor sod.

649
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,310
Looked like he'd been in the wars
with that bandaged hand.

650
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,951
I love you.

651
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,111
Let's call Davie.

652
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,794
- You filthy swine.
- Ooh, yeah.

653
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,389
Davie's not at the boarding house.

654
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,834
Where is he, then?

655
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,834
Well, strangely enough,
he didn't leave a message.

656
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,797
Why would Davie want to kill Haslam?

657
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,191
And why would he say he stole money
from Haslam when he didn't?

658
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,635
You know, I might just have a theory.

659
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,554
Davie was a good boxer,
but he wasn't champion material.

660
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,312
It's never about money
for boxers like Davie.

661
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,392
It was about pride,
about being a man.

662
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,152
So what is it about?

663
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,709
It wasn't about money for Davie.
It was for Haslam.

664
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,429
It was Davie's last fight
and he didn't start well.

665
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,716
First few rounds, you'd never believe
he was in that ring.

666
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,555
He had no... no power,
no movement, nothing.

667
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,837
Then he started to get better.
By the sixth round, he'd come out

668
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,072
like an Alsatian with a red-hot poker
rammed up his arse.

669
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,119
Floored the other fella with
a single punch. It was magnificent.

670
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,477
Great moment. Great win.
But it shouldn't have happened.

671
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,757
- What do you mean?
- He wasn't supposed to win.

672
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,151
Davie had to explain to us
why he got beaten up.

673
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,949
Yeah, and he couldn't tell us.
He was supposed to throw the fight.

674
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,315
That gives him
an obvious motive to kill Haslam.

675
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,550
Very good.

676
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,757
So he probably saw you drop your gun
outside Haslam's.

677
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,876
A weapon falls into his lap.

678
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,918
He sees you lying there
in the street, barely conscious.

679
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,550
All he has to do is place you
at the scene to shore things up.

680
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,029
You know,
you'll make a detective yet.

681
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,792
Let's get over to the boxing club.

682
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,713
SWEET'S
"DONE ME WRONG ALL RIGHT")

683
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,995
<i># I woke up this morning</i>

684
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,151
<i># My girl was not inside</i>

685
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,790
<i># Looked inside my billfold,
she'd done me wrong all right...</i>

686
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,878
You can't go in there.

687
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,635
Or has it slipped your attention
that you're public enemy number one?

688
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,437
Is that your idea of a disguise?

689
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,990
Impenetrable. I pass through crowds
like the Invisible Man.

690
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,396
Guv. It's Morgan.

691
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,790
We've got to bring you in.

692
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,228
Right.

693
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,789
CREAM'S "CROSSROADS")

694
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,234
Hang on.

695
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,231
Guv?

696
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,709
- Why are we running?
- Because they're chasing us!

697
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,829
In here.

698
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,430
Why don't we go to Morgan
with what we know?

699
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,068
Trust a man from Hyde? No chance.

700
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,831
Come on.

701
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,274
Bastards.

702
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,229
Ray.

703
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,914
- Eh, I've got a stitch.
- Oh, come on, you div.

704
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,514
What do you want? Who are you?

705
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,638
- Mr Hunt.
- Need a favour, Mickey.

706
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,392
- The usual. Put those on.
- Right.

707
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,879
Mush, mush.

708
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,838
Oh, shit, they've doubled back!

709
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,078
Un-bloody-believable. Come on.

710
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,196
I can't believe
they fell for the same trick twice.

711
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,113
They really are bloody useless.

712
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,713
- Hang on. How did you get...?
- Mickey Holmes. He owes me one.

713
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,599
78, he still drives
like a bloody lunatic.

714
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,752
Mind you,
he better not scratch the paintwork.

715
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,598
Keep your head up. Good.

716
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,751
Whoa. Take a break.

717
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,240
Hello, Mr Hunt.

718
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,994
Haslam wanted you to throw
that fight, didn't he, Davie?

719
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:12,551
He had a lot of money riding on it.
Him and Pete Wilkes.

720
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,678
He was going to see you OK,
slip you a few quid.

721
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,398
You'd end up the loser.

722
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,028
You couldn't do it, could you?

723
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:24,113
So you did what you do best.
You fought back and won.

724
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,909
I know what the life's like.
I'm not stupid.

725
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,230
I see them through the ropes,

726
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,837
sitting in the front row with their
suits and cigars and rolls of cash.

727
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,790
People like you, parasites,
think it's a game.

728
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,350
Like any game, you want to bend
the rules in your favour.

729
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,353
Only it's not a game to us.
Not when that bell goes.

730
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,033
It's fighting.

731
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,670
Brutal. Hard, bloody fighting.

732
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,079
It's kill or be killed.

733
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,552
And you stood up.
Like I did in court.

734
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,750
Did you kill Terry Haslam?

735
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,115
He thought he owned me.

736
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,353
Like I was a dog.
Like a piece of meat.

737
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,876
And then I saw you
pissing in the street that night.

738
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,836
It was an ideal opportunity.

739
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,233
You want to know what really
twisted my guts? What killed me?

740
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,719
Pete Wilkes.

741
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,670
My man, my corner, just sitting back
and letting it happen.

742
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,117
So, aye, I did Haslam.
And I did Wilkes.

743
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,032
I did 'em both.

744
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,476
And d'you know what?
I'd do 'em again.

745
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,754
You're coming in.

746
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,594
I'm not sorry for what I did.

747
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,070
Didn't think you would be,
a man like you.

748
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,831
Come on.

749
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,996
Oh. Nice of you to drop in
once I've already solved the case

750
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,510
I'll take over from here.

751
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,154
He's here.

752
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:52,790
I believe I have a right
to feel a little upset.

753
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:59,751
See, I understood that I commanded
your unswerving loyalty, your love,

754
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,436
affection
and unquestioning obedience.

755
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,879
Apparently I was mistaken.

756
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:12,192
However, given the evidence
with which you were confronted,

757
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,635
I can understand
why that loyalty wavered.

758
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,475
What I find
somewhat harder to understand

759
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,393
is how you miserable tossers

760
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,915
could for one second

761
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,517
believe that I could be
a frigging bastard murderer!

762
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,637
Oh, and another thing.

763
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,279
I should inform you

764
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,194
that I intend to drink the equivalent
of the North Sea in whisky tonight.

765
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,669
So raid your piggy banks.

766
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,756
Show us what you've got.
Hey-hey-hey!

767
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,431
No hard feelings?

768
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,599
Just doing your job, copper.

769
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,715
Ray.

770
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,950
Cheers, Guv.

771
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,793
Cheers, you bunch of Judases.

772
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,838
- Oh, go on, Chris. Go on, then.
- Hey...

773
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,351
Nice one.

774
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,230
- Night, Sam.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

775
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,878
Where you going?

776
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,439
Er... home.

777
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,469
Stay.

778
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,676
Right, I told you all, to me!

779
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,638
- Come on, lads!
- I'm the sheriff!

780
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,837
You had to believe
Gene was innocent, didn't you?

781
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,356
Couldn't bear to think
he might betray you?

782
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,949
Could you?

783
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,190
Well...

784
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:27,673
if you haven't got trust,
who are you supposed to believe in?

785
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,435
You have to start with what you know.

786
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,718
You know?
What you see in front of you.

787
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,548
And what do you see?

788
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,551
I see you.

789
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,317
Good work.

790
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,397
Hey, listen.

791
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,470
We're all right, aren't we?
You and me.

792
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,712
Oh, yeah. You're doing a great job.

793
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,156
- Cheers.
- Really.

794
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,153
We're all very proud of you.

795
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:21,030
Not your fault Hunt wriggled
out of it. Good opportunity, but...

796
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:29,789
Hang in there, Sam.
Soon as we can, we'll sort this out.

797
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,269
Bring you back home.
