1
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:55,390
CARRUTHERS: I'm telling you something...

2
00:00:56,745 --> 00:00:59,605
You've got to be careful when
you're doing your stakeouts.

3
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:01,905
I did one for... I was
on one for six months.

4
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:04,575
I gained, like, 20, 25 pounds.
You keep eating this crap...

5
00:01:04,645 --> 00:01:07,885
Well, that's my problem, though.
I don't gain weight. I tried.

6
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:09,615
That's 'cause you're 12 years old.

7
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:10,945
Yeah, well, then, who gives a shit?

8
00:01:11,025 --> 00:01:12,545
Can I get you something to drink?

9
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,185
You're disgusting.

10
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:16,786
Come on, don't keep it by the water either.

11
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,997
Don't even let it rub shoulders
with the other bottle.

12
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,959
Do you know what?
Urine is good for your skin.

13
00:01:23,043 --> 00:01:28,048
My grandmother... I swear to God,
my grandmother told me.

14
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:32,594
She said... She did, 'cause when
I used to get a zit or something, she said...

15
00:01:32,677 --> 00:01:34,221
She pissed on your face?

16
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:36,847
Get the fuck out of here.
Are you fucking nuts?

17
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,891
- What?
- It's my grandmother!

18
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,936
You just told me your grandma said
that piss is good for your skin.

19
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,145
Have some respect. Come on.

20
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,772
STEVE ON RADIO:
We have some activity here.

21
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:50,444
Why don't you speak a little louder, Steve?
Just keep it fucking down.

22
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,238
What, now?
- The old man's in bed.

23
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,990
The nurse is in there
and then Serna is somewhere in the house.

24
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,826
- Who's in the back? Who's in the back? Joe.
- Joe.

25
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,204
Joe, are you guys seeing anything?

26
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,165
Because if you are,
it's certainly not coming up here in the van

27
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:05,376
and we'd certainly like
to see what's going on.

28
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,836
We've been here for 16 hours.

29
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,005
It's pretty dead.

30
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:12,675
Thank you, Captain Obvious.

31
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:17,471
All right well, just stay awake, guys.
Stay on it. Stay alert.

32
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:20,432
AGENT 1: Hey, yo, Mike,
where are you, man? I can't see you now.

33
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:21,850
Are you nervous?

34
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:24,645
What?

35
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,481
- What kind of deodorant do you use?
- I don't use deodorant.

36
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,567
- Look at you.
- What? I live in a van.

37
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,859
What does that mean?

38
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,820
It's bad for you. It causes Alzheimer's.

39
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:33,988
What?

40
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:36,490
Alzheimer's. You get Alzheimer's
if you're using antiperspirant

41
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:37,658
with aluminium.

42
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,702
I'm sorry. I forgot. I don't remember
what you said. What?

43
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,036
Fucking asshole.

44
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,832
Watch it. Watch it.
Watch who your superior is, pal.

45
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,465
STEVE: Serna just picked up
the house phone.

46
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,509
AGENT 2: He's on the phone now.
He is on the phone. He's on the phone.

47
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,219
AGENT 1: I got some movement in there.

48
00:02:57,303 --> 00:03:00,097
Ricky, pan to the right and zoom in.

49
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,225
Okay, we got him. We got him. We got him.

50
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,476
Here we go. Here we go.

51
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,895
Zoom back in and stay there.

52
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,397
STEVE: He is on the phone. Do you guys
have any transmission? He's on the phone.

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,690
Quiet, quiet. We got it.

54
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,734
- He's talking to someone right now.
- Just keep zooming in.

55
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,819
- SERNA: Buzz.
- Dialogue hot. Dialogue hot.

56
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,155
Everybody off the walkies now.
Everybody off air.

57
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,448
You got clicks?

58
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:22,452
PADICHE: Clicks? No.
Nothing on my end. The line's clean.

59
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,078
STEVE: Do you guys have
any signal out there?

60
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,581
Yeah, we got it. Please stay off the walkies.

61
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,375
STEVE: Buzzy, I'm upstairs. I can't talk
very loud. Primo's downstairs.

62
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,295
PADICHE: I've been sitting by this phone
for 20 fucking hours.

63
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,131
STEVE: Now listen to me, Buzzy.
He's going to clip Israel.

64
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,674
Clip? He's gonna kill him?

65
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,842
Buddy Israel?

66
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,637
Now, I was eavesdropping,
so let me lay this thing out neat.

67
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,805
All right, I'm listening. Go ahead.

68
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,976
Now, what I heard downstairs is
they got a guy. Some Swede.

69
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,186
Swede.

70
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,772
- You know a Swede? You know of a Swede?
- Nothing.

71
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:54,234
Supposedly, a specialist.
And he ain't coming cheap.

72
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:59,614
So I'm thinking we jump, get to Israel before
the Swede can, we're in a power position.

73
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,449
- We grab him...
- It's a double-cross.

74
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,117
...ransom him back, pick up that nut.

75
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,203
We're that much closer to
doing our own thing.

76
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,538
Kidnapping? Can we bring this off?

77
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:10,959
Hey, we keep our mouth shut, play the part,
nobody suspects a thing.

78
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,169
The old man's on the fade, Buzzy.
Fuck them, you know.

79
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,672
These guys got balls. Let me tell you.
These guys got some balls.

80
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,839
Do they ever.

81
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,424
Jesus Christ, this is our time now.

82
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,177
You think they'll really
kick ransom for Israel?

83
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,971
You ain't heard the punch line.

84
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,640
But before I get to it, one more thing.
I should probably bring it up.

85
00:04:26,723 --> 00:04:28,475
Primo wants Israel's heart.

86
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:32,688
- What'd he just say?
- He's going to cut his heart out.

87
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:34,648
His heart? Jesus, what for?

88
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:37,651
He's been snitching to the world.
I can't even blame Primo.

89
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:40,195
You know, he's old-school Sicilian.
This is how they hate.

90
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,864
Now, big concern for me, at least,
we crew up.

91
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:46,618
Let's not fuck around. Someone's cousin,
some zip off the boat from Naples.

92
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:47,869
Zip off the boat?

93
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:50,163
Let's get pros. People who know
how to behave.

94
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:51,415
This thing's gonna blow up huge.

95
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:54,543
You know, there's a pair of broads
I think might be very good for this.

96
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:55,752
Which broads?

97
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:57,546
They're reliable? They're good? What?

98
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:01,425
Two of the best. They hit those Chinamen,
took out the big triad.

99
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:05,554
These girls are worth every penny.
I'll call Loretta. She handles both of them.

100
00:05:05,637 --> 00:05:07,472
All right.
Odds are they're gonna get into some shit.

101
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:08,640
Might have to put people down.

102
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:10,058
These guys aren't fucking around.

103
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:13,395
PADICHE: Well, just so I get a quote
in my head, how much is the Swede getting?

104
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:14,813
That's the punch line. You ready?

105
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,023
Here's the punch line.

106
00:05:16,106 --> 00:05:17,566
One million flat.

107
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,359
Holy shit.

108
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:22,070
If word hits the street
that there's a million-dollar bounty

109
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:23,780
for Buddy fucking Israel,

110
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:27,284
you're gonna have every fucking hit man
in the free world looking for him.

111
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:30,704
We got to move quickly. No more tomorrow.
I got to go, Buzzy.

112
00:05:30,787 --> 00:05:32,956
- He said one million.
- One million.

113
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,625
One million, plus the fucking heart.

114
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,169
- Plus the heart.
- And Buddy Israel.

115
00:05:38,962 --> 00:05:40,881
Holy shit.

116
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:43,425
These guys want him bad.

117
00:05:44,384 --> 00:05:46,345
Ladies and gentlemen, there's a guy,

118
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:50,014
he is one of the biggest stars in the world.

119
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:53,267
And we are thrilled to have him stop by.

120
00:05:53,768 --> 00:05:56,270
And he's won all kinds of awards.

121
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:58,898
He has won Entertainer of the Year

122
00:05:58,981 --> 00:06:02,193
every year in Las Vegas
for the last five years.

123
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:05,780
Ladies and gentlemen, would you give
a big round of applause,

124
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:10,701
a big Las Vegas welcome,
to a great Las Vegas star

125
00:06:10,785 --> 00:06:14,163
and his name is Mr Buddy Israel!

126
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:15,998
Come on out here!

127
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:19,585
DUPREE: Buddy "Aces" Israel.

128
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,964
Card sharp. Illusionist.

129
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:28,970
Asshole.

130
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:32,390
I say this
from the bottom of my heart. Retire.

131
00:06:32,473 --> 00:06:33,558
Douchebag.

132
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,562
Five-time Vegas Showman of the Year.

133
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:46,362
The wiseguys, for some fucking reason,
love him.

134
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:49,824
They think he's, like, a mystic.
You know, something special.

135
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,159
Nice shot.

136
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:59,041
Now, Buddy starts making friends.
The connected kind.

137
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,419
He's doing the Sinatra thing.

138
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,090
Becomes the unofficial mob mascot.

139
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,842
Can I whack anybody?
Who am I gonna whack?

140
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:09,218
Stop it. Stop it.

141
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:12,346
Now he's got connections. He's got pull.

142
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,347
So he starts to make plays.

143
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,892
Wants to live the mob life for real.

144
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:21,438
Bankrolls a couple of B&Es. Rich folks.

145
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:24,691
Fronts some smash-and-grabs, pawn shops,
jewellery stores, that kind of thing.

146
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:28,904
Then he gets his dick wet.
Strong-arm robbery.

147
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,198
Get in the van, man! Get in the van now!
Go! Go! Go!

148
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:36,745
Vegas lounge act turns legitimate thug.

149
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,082
Truth is, Buddy don't know the fucking ball
from the bounce.

150
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,209
What do you got?

151
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:43,335
He's a wannabe.

152
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:47,505
Like most wannabes, he starts
fucking up fast and picking up speed.

153
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:51,593
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me?

154
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:54,304
That's good work. Good fucking work.
I love it.

155
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:00,769
His little criminal foray shines a floodlight
on the entire Carlotta organisation.

156
00:08:00,852 --> 00:08:04,648
Cops get curious, they start camping out
and everything goes sideways

157
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:06,733
real fucking quick.

158
00:08:08,443 --> 00:08:10,612
People get pinched, snitches snitch.

159
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:15,283
The next thing you know, Buddy Israel
has brought the heat to bear

160
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:19,079
on none other than
Mr Primo Sparazza himself.

161
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:20,455
Enforcer,

162
00:08:22,374 --> 00:08:24,167
extortionist, killer.

163
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,462
Sparazza has been rumoured
to have performed

164
00:08:27,546 --> 00:08:30,090
in excess of 100 contract murders,

165
00:08:30,173 --> 00:08:33,885
including one of the Bureau's most
celebrated agents, Freeman Heller.

166
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:35,470
I thought Heller was a double-op?

167
00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:38,973
He worked for the OSS
before joining the Bureau in its heyday.

168
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:43,102
He was the first operative assigned
with infiltrating the mob.

169
00:08:43,185 --> 00:08:45,688
Fake identity, falsified backgrounds,

170
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:47,982
everything that is now
standard operating procedure,

171
00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:50,442
- Heller implemented way back when.
...your attention to these overlays,

172
00:08:50,526 --> 00:08:54,196
I'll show you exactly what I meant
when I said, "Change my face."

173
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,284
And as a result, his undercover work
was highly successful.

174
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,829
Using the latest techniques
in cosmetic surgery,

175
00:09:01,912 --> 00:09:04,081
I will have my ears pinned back.

176
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:08,586
Removing a slight piece of bone in my chin,
I will alter my jaw line.

177
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:13,007
Eventually, he reached the rank of capo
inside the Carlotta crime family,

178
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,719
but due to some internal slipup,
his cover was compromised.

179
00:09:16,802 --> 00:09:19,638
Primo Sparazza was given the contract
to kill him.

180
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:23,642
Sparazza is a bit of a spectre.

181
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:28,022
Over the years, the serious crimes with
which he was thought to be involved with,

182
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:30,566
including Heller's murder,
could never be traced back to him.

183
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:34,153
A dedicated viciousness
and slavish devotion to mob doctrine

184
00:09:34,236 --> 00:09:36,572
had Sparazza's star on the rise.

185
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:38,824
So they relocated him to Nevada
and made him the head

186
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:39,992
of the Las Vegas Cosa Nostra.

187
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:41,118
Water.

188
00:09:41,202 --> 00:09:42,703
What's his connection to Israel?

189
00:09:42,786 --> 00:09:45,164
Sparazza introduced Israel to the life.

190
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:49,335
Gave him his first big break onstage,
brought him up through the ranks.

191
00:09:49,418 --> 00:09:52,129
And Israel played the situation
very shrewdly.

192
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:54,965
Slowly amassing the loyalties
of Sparazza's top men,

193
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:56,550
with the idea of toppling the throne.

194
00:09:56,634 --> 00:09:59,178
You know,
I've seen some stupid moves, but...

195
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:02,096
Well, you spend your life pulling rabbits
out of hats and sawing people in half,

196
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,681
anything seems possible.

197
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:06,351
Israel wanted to touch something real,
something dangerous.

198
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:10,813
But what he wound up doing was splitting
the family into dual factions.

199
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:13,900
Sparazza on one side, Israel on the other.

200
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:22,617
The infighting that followed drew
the interest of every investigative body

201
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,494
operating under the canopy
of the federal government.

202
00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:25,703
This is it, right here.

203
00:10:25,787 --> 00:10:27,288
Presently, we have...

204
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:31,751
Sixteen state and federally-funded agencies
running concurrent criminal probes

205
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:33,753
on select members of La Cosa Nostra.

206
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:37,632
LOCKE: With Israel being the target
of virtually every one.

207
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:41,135
His testimony has the potential
of blowing the lid

208
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:43,638
off of what's left of La Cosa Nostra
in this country.

209
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:46,391
That alone warrants total immunity
from prosecution

210
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:49,602
and a vanishing act
with the Witness Protection Programme.

211
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:56,985
The wiretaps on Serna and Padiche,
mention of Israel's heart?

212
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:59,320
Well, that corroborates
what we already know.

213
00:10:59,404 --> 00:11:00,488
Sparazza's health is in rapid decline

214
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:05,451
and before he dies, he is demanding
the heart of his sworn enemy.

215
00:11:05,535 --> 00:11:10,707
A recently opened million-dollar escrow
account has been traced back to Sparazza.

216
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,334
That, and the mention
of this mysterious Swede

217
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:15,837
makes the contract on Israel
all the more real.

218
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:17,255
How real?

219
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:24,137
How about six figures for that fool?
How's that love?

220
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,222
- Bullshit.
- No, baby.

221
00:11:27,306 --> 00:11:31,184
They heard about that triad hit,
the work y'all put in.

222
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:33,061
And they recognise the skills.

223
00:11:33,145 --> 00:11:34,605
Now, you all want this?

224
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:37,524
- Hell, yeah.
- Well, I'm gonna get it for you.

225
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:38,901
What?

226
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,824
There it is! There it is!

227
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:47,826
You called the right bitches
for this one, man.

228
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,998
You see? Write that shit down.

229
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:59,338
Are you saying that just because me and
baby girl here got a rep on the rise,

230
00:11:59,421 --> 00:12:01,882
you know, we chipped some nails
on some niggas,

231
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:05,677
they want us to go in
and drop this mafioso motherfucker?

232
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:09,806
The way it works, girl. Y'all peeled
some serious caps. Word travels.

233
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,061
So, we're supposed to go in there,
bust on this punk

234
00:12:14,144 --> 00:12:15,979
and remove his heart. Is that for real?

235
00:12:16,063 --> 00:12:21,026
You go in and pull him out.
That heart shit? That's just for flavour.

236
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,030
Now, I'm still trying to get the down-low
from this cat Padiche.

237
00:12:25,113 --> 00:12:29,952
What we got right now
is a number and a name.

238
00:12:30,035 --> 00:12:31,370
Buddy Israel.

239
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:33,622
What else did Padiche say?

240
00:12:33,705 --> 00:12:36,917
He said the shit might get hot
and might get heavy.

241
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,921
I said, "Cool.
'Cause I got two of the hottest,

242
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:42,756
"heaviest bitches alive."

243
00:12:43,257 --> 00:12:45,425
- Like who?
- Like Pasquale Acosta.

244
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:47,553
Blood-money mercenary.

245
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:52,265
His countrymen have dubbed him
the more dubious "El Estrago."

246
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:54,267
"The Plague."

247
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:58,312
American educated. Fluent in over
a dozen languages. Freelanced for the CIA.

248
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:02,733
Noted for his legendary torture techniques.

249
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:14,078
When he was caught by the SAS
in Northern Ireland,

250
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,706
in prison he chewed off his fingertips
to the bones,

251
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:19,000
so he couldn't be printed or ID'd by Interpol.

252
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,586
Is it possible that he could be involved
in this?

253
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:26,048
A million-dollar hit fee would draw some
huge flies. And Acosta's pure mercenary.

254
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:30,970
He has a history of taking on tough kills,
and he's certainly not alone.

255
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:33,806
- Who else?
- How about the Tremor Brothers?

256
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:38,644
Three of them.
Same skank mom, different deadbeat dads.

257
00:13:38,728 --> 00:13:41,647
They're used for
that suicide-style, kamikaze shit.

258
00:13:41,731 --> 00:13:43,441
Heard about that dinner club in Cleveland?

259
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:47,486
That got squat-fucked, shot to shit,
slashed and burned?

260
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,363
What happened?

261
00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:53,326
Well, the Tremor Brothers go rip-shit riot
on the whole fucking place.

262
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:56,621
Seven dead, 28 wounded.

263
00:13:56,704 --> 00:13:58,789
Just to get this one fucking guy.

264
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:04,462
In the course of the melee, one of them
gets shot in the neck. He passes out.

265
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:07,340
Another one catches blowback
from a jammed piece.

266
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:08,507
He's temporarily blinded.

267
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:11,928
Third one gets a bullet lodged in his back,
he can't walk.

268
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:18,683
They're speed-freak, neo-Nazi assholes
who read and recite

269
00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:21,186
Mein Kampf like it was Mother Goose.

270
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:22,812
They're meaner than shit,
they're dumber than hell

271
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,356
and these motherfuckers will go megaton

272
00:14:28,944 --> 00:14:30,153
at the drop of a hat.

273
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,696
SYKES: I ain't never heard of him.
WATTERS: Me, neither.

274
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:36,243
Then listen up, 'cause he may wind up
being your main competition.

275
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:40,205
His name is Soot. Lazlo Soot.

276
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:46,211
A lot of folks want this white boy clapped.
Word is Soot is working for one of them.

277
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:51,341
Now, they don't know where he's from,
how long he's been in the game,

278
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,218
or even what he looks like.

279
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:57,806
But when Soot decides to move
on somebody,

280
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:02,727
they're the last ones to see it coming.

281
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:39,555
DUPREE: So, there it is.

282
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:43,517
The bond on Buddy Israel expires
in 18 hours. After that, it's a jump ball.

283
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:45,436
Who posted the bond?

284
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,439
Same guys who hired me,
his former law firm.

285
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:51,066
He walked out the door after he made bail.
Hasn't been seen since.

286
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,654
If this Israel really is the great white whale
of snitches,

287
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:59,116
then what are we doing messing
with the mob, who are,

288
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,871
correct me if I'm wrong, but I think they're
going to pour boxes of bullets into his ass?

289
00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:04,997
Here we go.

290
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,082
What incentive is there to track him

291
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,336
on something as small time
as a fucking skip trace?

292
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:11,795
I take it you're not going.

293
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,548
No, I'm gonna go into Kentucky

294
00:16:14,632 --> 00:16:16,634
and take Fort Knox
with a fucking slingshot,

295
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:18,260
and after that I'm gonna go
into hell after Hitler.

296
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,764
Would you please find your fangs,
you fucking coward,

297
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:25,142
and get with this? What is wrong with you?

298
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,187
Seriously. What is wrong with you?

299
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,858
Listen, I know where Israel is, okay?

300
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:36,862
So we have maybe a day

301
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:39,240
before that location that I know

302
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:42,493
gets grapevined and
the whole fucking world gets hip to this.

303
00:16:42,576 --> 00:16:45,079
He's in Lake Tahoe on the Nevada side.

304
00:16:45,162 --> 00:16:46,872
We got to lay something out, though.

305
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:49,166
You go up in there ad-libbing and shit,
it's your ass.

306
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,086
- What are we talking on the split?
- Forty-five a piece for you two.

307
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:53,712
Ten percent finder's fee for me.

308
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:56,257
- So, what's the time frame?
- Fast as we can get you there.

309
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,677
We wait any longer,
someone gonna dead this fool.

310
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,844
MESSNER: Then we lose our witness.

311
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:03,138
And we lose our case.

312
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:07,225
Now, Israel's manager,
a man by the name of Morris Mecklen,

313
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:10,728
has guaranteed us that Israel will enter
into protective custody

314
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:13,648
once the government has approved his deal.

315
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:16,734
Now, we've been monitoring
Mecklen's phone calls,

316
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:19,153
and we've learnt that Israel
is at the penthouse level

317
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:23,408
of the Nomad Hotel and Casino
in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.

318
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:26,578
- The high-roller suite?
- No, that's the last place they'd look.

319
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:29,581
Israel's lawyers were left holding
the bag after he skipped bail.

320
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:33,418
And Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners,
has learnt of his whereabouts.

321
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:36,838
And he's dispatched a local bondsman
by the name of Jack Dupree

322
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:39,716
to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas.

323
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:43,887
It's very simple, gentlemen.
We can't allow that to happen.

324
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,264
A Gulfstream is waiting
at the Reagan National Airport

325
00:17:46,347 --> 00:17:49,017
to transport you to Lake Tahoe.

326
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,103
And I'll be flying to Los Angeles
to finalise Israel's deal.

327
00:17:52,186 --> 00:17:56,816
No former witness against the mob
has been as crucial or as important

328
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,778
as Buddy "Aces" Israel.
He's not only essential to our case,

329
00:18:01,738 --> 00:18:03,865
he is our case.

330
00:18:03,948 --> 00:18:08,578
And understand that if an attempt
is made on his life,

331
00:18:08,661 --> 00:18:12,832
it'll be made by those
of the strictest professional calibre.

332
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:17,045
They are amoral, ruthless
and without restraint.

333
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:21,007
They must not succeed.

334
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:24,594
PADICHE: Sid.

335
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:28,472
SERNA: Yeah, Buzzy, I just got a call
from the mansion. The Swede has arrived.

336
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:29,681
No shit.

337
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:34,770
The old man sent for him. So get yourself
on a plane and get your ass to Lake Tahoe.

338
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:23,777
Are you fucking kidding me?

339
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:27,573
Fuck you.

340
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:37,583
Goodbye.

341
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,959
Good luck.

342
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:42,045
Godspeed.

343
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:44,381
- Good day, sir.
- Hey, baby.

344
00:19:44,464 --> 00:19:46,967
- Don't fuck... What the...
- Where you going?

345
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:54,974
You call Mecklen?

346
00:19:56,142 --> 00:19:57,810
I got the machine.

347
00:19:58,102 --> 00:19:59,437
What did you say?

348
00:20:00,605 --> 00:20:01,939
I leave message.

349
00:20:02,106 --> 00:20:05,026
I know you left a message.
What did you say?

350
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:09,572
Hugo, you're staring at me
like I just asked you

351
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:11,574
for the fucking square root of something.

352
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:14,952
What did you say to Mecklen
on the little motherfucking machine?

353
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:19,498
That you were returning his call
and you were very, very concerned.

354
00:20:19,582 --> 00:20:22,084
Wow, that's fantastic work, man.

355
00:20:22,168 --> 00:20:24,712
You have the wisdom
of a 6,000 or 7,000-year-old man.

356
00:20:24,795 --> 00:20:25,880
That's fantastic.

357
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:27,798
We don't have to fill up
the whole blackboard after all.

358
00:20:27,882 --> 00:20:29,175
Do me a favour, will you?

359
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:31,636
Will you tell me what that is?

360
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:32,970
About what?

361
00:20:33,054 --> 00:20:35,973
Look at the collar on that coat.
What does that look like? That stain?

362
00:20:41,812 --> 00:20:44,815
I don't know. Cinnamon roll?

363
00:20:45,733 --> 00:20:49,570
Is it cinnamon roll?
The cinnamon. The roll of the cinnamon?

364
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:53,449
That looks like jizz.

365
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:54,659
Yeah.

366
00:20:54,742 --> 00:20:57,370
Eastern European jizz.

367
00:20:57,453 --> 00:21:03,334
That looks like some fuckhead shot his load
on a $12,000 calfskin jacket!

368
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:07,296
The twist is it's my $12,000 calfskin jacket!

369
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,175
So, you got the semen, okay,
you've got the human ejaculate

370
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:14,637
that's been allowed to soak in
for, like, 7 hours! All right?

371
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,430
Work its way into the fabric fucking fibres...

372
00:21:17,514 --> 00:21:19,516
If you like, I send out.

373
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,396
To what? Incinerate?

374
00:21:25,313 --> 00:21:26,648
Hugo!

375
00:21:27,065 --> 00:21:31,611
There isn't a fucking laundry detergent
or dry cleaning product

376
00:21:31,695 --> 00:21:34,197
known to man that will get that clean.

377
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:37,534
Some shit, suffice it to say,
just don't wash out!

378
00:21:37,617 --> 00:21:41,246
- Do you want my apology?
- Only if you really, truly mean it.

379
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:43,039
I very sorry.

380
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,586
- Are you a colossal fucking idiot?
- I am, yes.

381
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:50,922
Get the phone. It's probably Mecklen.
Get Vitoli up here and start cleaning.

382
00:21:51,006 --> 00:21:52,090
All right?

383
00:21:52,173 --> 00:21:54,801
And please, for me, will you do one thing?

384
00:21:58,513 --> 00:21:59,764
Get out of my fucking sight.

385
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:02,142
Yes, sir. Go ahead.

386
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:06,313
We're about three miles
from the Nomad now.

387
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:10,901
SERNA ON TAPE: So do this in the next day
or so, get to Israel before the Swede can,

388
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:12,861
- we're in a power position.
- All right, we'll be awaiting word.

389
00:22:12,944 --> 00:22:14,487
All right, we got time.
Want to go grab something to eat?

390
00:22:14,571 --> 00:22:16,573
Yeah. Any word on this Swede?

391
00:22:16,656 --> 00:22:18,408
No, just the mention in that phone call.

392
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:21,119
There's no Swedish hit man
on anyone's radar.

393
00:22:21,203 --> 00:22:22,370
Maybe he's that good.

394
00:22:22,454 --> 00:22:24,456
You know, never been caught.
No criminal record. It's possible.

395
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,833
Maybe, but that's very unlikely.

396
00:22:26,917 --> 00:22:30,378
Jesus, I'll tell you, engineering
this kind of play against Sparazza,

397
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:34,257
going to these lengths that these two guys
are going, they're playing some long odds.

398
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:37,093
Coffee? Anything?
I don't want to order without...

399
00:22:37,177 --> 00:22:38,220
No, no, we cool.

400
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:40,930
- Coffee?
- No, no, thanks, darling. Lovely.

401
00:22:41,513 --> 00:22:43,432
So, I spoke to Loretta this morning.

402
00:22:43,515 --> 00:22:46,519
And she told me you, more or less,
have a plan of attack.

403
00:22:46,602 --> 00:22:50,189
My associate, Mr Serna,
I can get him on the phone

404
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:53,275
and if you could just speak to him
and tell him your plan...

405
00:22:55,653 --> 00:22:57,988
- Your plans. What you got in mind?
- Pussy.

406
00:22:59,907 --> 00:23:00,991
I'm sorry?

407
00:23:01,242 --> 00:23:02,576
Pussy.

408
00:23:03,285 --> 00:23:04,620
Pushy?

409
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:08,457
Pussy.

410
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:12,294
Yeah, Israel likes pussy.

411
00:23:12,378 --> 00:23:13,963
And we like

412
00:23:14,046 --> 00:23:16,215
that he likes...

413
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:17,758
Pussy.

414
00:23:17,841 --> 00:23:19,051
Correct.

415
00:23:19,134 --> 00:23:20,219
Well,

416
00:23:21,053 --> 00:23:22,388
enough said.

417
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:26,809
Hi, Jack. Great, good, super.
Come on in. Good to see you.

418
00:23:26,892 --> 00:23:29,478
- How you doing? Pete.
- Hello. Rip Reed. Come in. Good. Good.

419
00:23:29,562 --> 00:23:31,647
Great. Come on. What's that in there...

420
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,650
Hello? Great. Come on in. Sorry about that.

421
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:37,152
- Hey, Hollis.
- Rip Reed. Hello, Hollis. Come on in.

422
00:23:37,236 --> 00:23:40,322
So, Jack, he tells me you guys
a couple of ex-cops?

423
00:23:41,782 --> 00:23:43,868
- Yeah, we worked vice, like, 6 years.
- Is that right?

424
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:44,994
- Four.
- Four years.

425
00:23:45,077 --> 00:23:46,161
- About six years.
- Vice.

426
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:48,873
Four, six, five. They didn't teach you
how to count, I guess, huh?

427
00:23:48,956 --> 00:23:51,500
But I bet you guys
got a bunch of stories, right? I don't.

428
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:55,462
I grew up soft with the private schools
and little blazers, you know, and...

429
00:23:55,546 --> 00:23:57,673
Everyone talked things out, you know?

430
00:23:57,756 --> 00:24:01,594
No one ever threw any blows.
Still to this day, never punched in the face.

431
00:24:01,677 --> 00:24:03,679
Imagine that? I'm pretty much a pantywaist.

432
00:24:03,762 --> 00:24:06,180
I don't say this to be self-deprecating.
I just, you know,

433
00:24:06,264 --> 00:24:08,808
don't have much of an opinion of myself.
I'd much rather be like you guys.

434
00:24:08,892 --> 00:24:11,811
You know, bar fighters and big,
swinging dicks, taking care of shit.

435
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:16,399
You know, sadly, this is it.
You know, it's disgusting. Thanks, God!

436
00:24:17,317 --> 00:24:21,029
Dog-pile of piss-poor physique on top of
a small cock and hereditary alcoholism.

437
00:24:21,112 --> 00:24:22,572
I appreciate it!

438
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:26,784
I'm babbling. I do that drunk. Please forgive.

439
00:24:26,868 --> 00:24:27,952
Let's get to the business at hand.

440
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:32,081
This wanted felon here, Buddy Israel,
little Rick Springfield, I guess.

441
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:35,335
And his bail-bond bobbing around
up there out at the lake.

442
00:24:35,418 --> 00:24:37,503
Rip, hand to God, you got nothing
to worry about with this.

443
00:24:37,587 --> 00:24:39,088
- Yeah?
- Okay? I've assembled a team now.

444
00:24:39,172 --> 00:24:40,798
We're gonna go in,
we're gonna get this guy,

445
00:24:40,882 --> 00:24:42,467
and everyone is gonna leave
the theatre grinning.

446
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,135
No problem. Will not be a problem.
No problem.

447
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:47,138
Great, that's good. You're feeling it,
you're feeling it. Come on.

448
00:24:47,222 --> 00:24:49,182
Outstanding! Get it up there!

449
00:24:49,265 --> 00:24:52,227
Come on. Come on, man. And bones it.

450
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:56,731
Huh? Right there, and then padlock it
and then you put the chain on it.

451
00:24:56,814 --> 00:24:58,816
That's a new one I'm working on.

452
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,195
- Really getting the hairy eyeball off that guy.
- No, no. No, no.

453
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:03,780
- He's all right?
- He's all right. Tell him.

454
00:25:03,863 --> 00:25:07,825
This is good, though, what you're telling
me. All right? I need to hear this stuff.

455
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:09,077
Little boosts.

456
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,664
Helps allay my fears. I pass
that peace of mind along to my partners.

457
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:14,749
All right. Look up. Hey, man.
That's not yours.

458
00:25:14,832 --> 00:25:16,000
Put the fucking rabbit down.

459
00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:17,585
Appreciate it. Get your dick-beaters off it.

460
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:21,005
Couple of things.
The hangers-on, his posse, you know,

461
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:24,217
they're all strapped or packing heat,
whatever the phrase is.

462
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,094
- I don't know what you guys call it.
- Strapped.

463
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:27,262
Strapped? Well, so, they got guns.

464
00:25:27,345 --> 00:25:30,013
What else? He drinks, you know.
Self-medicates. Total cliché.

465
00:25:30,097 --> 00:25:34,476
This guy. He's a strung-out, washed-up,
has-been, jerk, snitch,

466
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,645
fucking drunk, seven-layer loser.

467
00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:38,939
Right. Now I'm praying he puts up a fight!

468
00:25:39,022 --> 00:25:42,568
Please! Please, please, rape him
if it's possible!

469
00:25:42,651 --> 00:25:45,946
Punch him in the seat or something,
you know? Hit him in the brown.

470
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:50,367
I don't know. Anyway, I believe
we had a retainer for services rendered.

471
00:25:50,617 --> 00:25:52,077
$50,000.

472
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,288
ISRAEL: $50,000 for this fucking suite?

473
00:25:54,371 --> 00:25:57,916
- Yo, calm down.
- Don't tell me to fucking calm down!

474
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,794
- That's all they're gonna give us.
- Look at the attention we gettin', man.

475
00:26:00,878 --> 00:26:04,631
We campaigning like niggas ain't hot.
We hot.

476
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:08,010
And they losing a whole floor's worth
of business, saying it's under construction.

477
00:26:08,093 --> 00:26:11,054
I am not shelling out this kind of bread
for this shithole, all right?

478
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:13,849
This is a junior suite in Vegas. So, fuck this

479
00:26:13,932 --> 00:26:15,017
and the fucking animal kingdom.

480
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,395
- What?
- Vitoli not answer the phone.

481
00:26:18,478 --> 00:26:22,774
Go down there and get him.
Go down there! Come on. Let's go.

482
00:26:22,858 --> 00:26:25,319
- Has Mecklen called?
- No.

483
00:26:28,447 --> 00:26:29,907
When do we get concerned?

484
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,534
We don't get concerned.
We'll see movement on this soon.

485
00:26:32,618 --> 00:26:34,870
All right? We just got to knock off
a few more hours.

486
00:26:34,953 --> 00:26:37,164
These flowers have wilted. Call the florist.

487
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:38,999
No, I need you to chill.

488
00:26:39,082 --> 00:26:41,043
I need you to call the florist.

489
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:45,839
When your guy gonna call?
That's what's happening.

490
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:49,843
Hey, yo, Beanie.

491
00:26:52,095 --> 00:26:54,597
Hey, ladies. Get up.

492
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,974
Beans.

493
00:26:58,476 --> 00:27:01,145
Bag them and get some more on deck,
all right?

494
00:27:08,528 --> 00:27:09,862
All right, y'all.

495
00:27:09,946 --> 00:27:11,906
We did the damn thing.

496
00:27:12,573 --> 00:27:16,077
Now proceed to the front
in an orderly fashion,

497
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:20,122
or how the fuck y'all want to,
but get the fuck going.

498
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:23,251
Let's go, step lively. Get your ass up.
Put your clothes on, girl.

499
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:27,296
You're acting like y'all on sundial.
Y'all need to be on stopwatch.

500
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,763
Damn it. I didn't realise how fucked up
I was till I just saw your ass, girl.

501
00:27:35,846 --> 00:27:39,600
You went from Beyoncé to Bigfoot
in less than six fucking hours.

502
00:27:39,684 --> 00:27:40,810
Fuck you, pussy!

503
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:44,272
Hey, we did that dance, bitch. Kick rocks.

504
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:46,274
Goddamn!

505
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:49,569
Hey, yo, is this Madame Alex?

506
00:27:49,652 --> 00:27:51,445
Hey, y'all got sick leave?

507
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:54,282
'Cause one of your hoes just got fucked up!

508
00:27:54,365 --> 00:27:56,325
Yeah, she might be missing some work.

509
00:27:56,409 --> 00:28:00,955
Oh, hell, no! This is nice.
This is real nice! Play it up!

510
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:03,749
What you doing, girl?
Come on, man. Come on.

511
00:28:05,877 --> 00:28:07,753
- Hoes gotta go.
- Get them out of here. Let's go!

512
00:28:08,504 --> 00:28:09,755
Get them to the elevator.

513
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,216
- GIRL: Fuck you! Give me my purse!
- Shut the fuck up!

514
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,760
Hey, bitch! You forgot your hat!

515
00:28:14,844 --> 00:28:18,513
- Get your hands off me, asshole!
- Take your shit, bitch.

516
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:21,975
Thanks, Paul. Israel's awake.

517
00:28:22,726 --> 00:28:26,104
There was apparently a fight
with some prostitutes,

518
00:28:26,188 --> 00:28:27,230
but he wasn't involved.

519
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:29,482
- What, like an actual fight? They...
- Yeah, a fight.

520
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:32,194
- Jesus Christ.
- A scuffle, a donnybrook. Yeah.

521
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:36,281
He had one of his men call a madam
for another group of girls.

522
00:28:36,364 --> 00:28:37,782
- We're getting robbed here, man.
- Seriously.

523
00:28:37,866 --> 00:28:39,117
Three days staring at Sparazza's house.

524
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:41,912
This guy's got hookers
up there fistfighting.

525
00:28:41,995 --> 00:28:43,955
Look at all you're missing.

526
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:46,499
Have you checked this stuff out yet?
This is unbelievable.

527
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:49,377
You know that Sparazza's had
major elective plastic surgery.

528
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,503
Fifteen of them. Right?

529
00:28:50,587 --> 00:28:52,756
Fifteen separate procedures since 1952.

530
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:53,924
Look at the work he's had done.

531
00:28:54,007 --> 00:28:57,344
Nose, three times. Eyes. Eyelids. Jaw.

532
00:28:57,427 --> 00:28:59,262
You take every has-been actor in Hollywood,

533
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:00,805
- they haven't been cut this much.
- Easy.

534
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:03,099
Crazy, you know.
Wall-to-wall felony offences.

535
00:29:03,183 --> 00:29:07,020
Murder, of course. Extortion.
Arson. Grand larceny. Blah, blah, blah.

536
00:29:07,437 --> 00:29:10,106
And a paternity suit, just to,
you know, round out the portfolio there.

537
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,317
And not one single criminal charge
laid against him.

538
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,320
Well, you can't kill over a hundred people
without knowing how to tiptoe.

539
00:29:15,403 --> 00:29:17,989
Yeah, but the Bureau knows he killed Heller.

540
00:29:18,114 --> 00:29:19,491
Then why not go after him for that?

541
00:29:19,574 --> 00:29:21,493
Heller was buried by the agency.

542
00:29:21,576 --> 00:29:25,330
Any time an operative failed, or was
perceived to have failed, he was blackballed.

543
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:26,498
Look at what happened to Ness.

544
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:28,542
Ness and the Untouchables
took down Capone.

545
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,710
Heller got shot and killed.
The bad guys beat him.

546
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:33,421
Worse, Sparazza walked.
How much longer you think?

547
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,840
Who knows? Locke has been
with the lawyers from Justice

548
00:29:35,924 --> 00:29:37,008
since yesterday afternoon.

549
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:40,804
Israel's manager is acting as his attorney.
That's what's holding things up.

550
00:29:40,887 --> 00:29:44,181
So I want to be in that penthouse
a half a second after this deal is done.

551
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:45,850
We gonna get any guff from the hotel staff?

552
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:47,184
Israel's obviously paid them off.

553
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:49,353
We're not gonna have any trouble
with the hotel staff.

554
00:29:49,436 --> 00:29:52,356
You show them your ID
with the letters "FBI" in all caps,

555
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:54,900
it's instant compliance.
I've seen it happen a hundred times.

556
00:29:54,984 --> 00:29:59,613
Special Agent Gerald Diego, Federal Bureau
of Investigation, San Francisco Field Office.

557
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:02,366
We're conducting a series
of impromptu inspections

558
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:03,617
for the Nevada Gaming Commission,

559
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,244
and I'd like to speak
with your head of security.

560
00:30:05,327 --> 00:30:08,831
Okay, just one second.
Just hang on, sir.

561
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:20,593
Where'd you get these?

562
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:24,013
Same place that rents to the guards.

563
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:26,223
All right, there's a shift change at 9:00 a. M.

564
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:30,186
The graveyard gets off. We're gonna slip in
with the daytime guys when they go on.

565
00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:33,314
But what about access cards, passkeys?

566
00:30:33,397 --> 00:30:35,941
Yeah, well, we'll get our hands on those
when we get inside.

567
00:30:36,025 --> 00:30:37,651
Basically, there's two security levels, okay?

568
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:40,487
You got your casino-floor,
count-room surveillance,

569
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:42,740
then you got your general security.

570
00:30:42,823 --> 00:30:45,576
But I guess your friend
don't want to hear this.

571
00:30:46,118 --> 00:30:50,456
Hollis? Come on. Get the fuck out of the car.
Come on. Come on.

572
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:53,584
- How about we put a gun to your head?
- We've been through that already.

573
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:56,879
Well, then quit acting like someone
took a shit in your cereal bowl, all right?

574
00:30:56,962 --> 00:30:58,839
Reed paid us 50 grand.

575
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,549
What am I doing? Am I standing here?

576
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:02,885
- Am I standing here?
- Your attitude is fucking horrible.

577
00:31:02,968 --> 00:31:04,053
- It's embarrassing.
- All right. Cut it out.

578
00:31:04,136 --> 00:31:05,471
Two security levels.

579
00:31:05,554 --> 00:31:09,432
The one we're going in
under the guise of is general hotel security.

580
00:31:09,516 --> 00:31:11,768
They're basically
in charge of standing around the lobby

581
00:31:11,851 --> 00:31:13,686
with their dicks in their hands,
you know what I mean?

582
00:31:17,982 --> 00:31:22,111
There's a 35-person employee contingent
that goes at 9:00 in the morning.

583
00:31:22,195 --> 00:31:25,240
We're gonna break up, split apart,
blend in with them

584
00:31:25,323 --> 00:31:27,200
and reconnoiter at the hotel.

585
00:32:13,913 --> 00:32:15,748
Come here! Get over here!

586
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:39,730
You stay down! You stay down!
Do you hear what I'm saying?

587
00:32:46,361 --> 00:32:49,031
I forgive you, Darwin.

588
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:53,202
Shoot, I appreciate that, man.

589
00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:59,124
If I needed your car and me and my brothers
were wanted by the law,

590
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,501
I would've killed you to get it, too.

591
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:03,587
You would've?

592
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,339
Hell, yeah.

593
00:33:05,881 --> 00:33:10,219
We's just at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

594
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:12,804
So don't feel so bad, chief.

595
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:16,391
Oh, damn.

596
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:20,187
All right, then.

597
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,898
You know, up here in heaven, it's beautiful.

598
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:27,444
Really?

599
00:33:28,153 --> 00:33:30,322
I'll see you up here someday.

600
00:33:31,406 --> 00:33:32,908
You think so?

601
00:33:35,452 --> 00:33:37,454
I know so.

602
00:33:52,094 --> 00:33:53,554
Small world.

603
00:34:01,394 --> 00:34:03,980
All right, enough grab-assing, goddamn it!

604
00:34:05,773 --> 00:34:07,733
Grab them suits and the car.

605
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:10,778
And pitch them poor fellas in the lake.

606
00:34:12,446 --> 00:34:15,116
And y'all follow me over to the hotel.

607
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:24,584
Yeah, you want some of me?
Yeah, just wait till we get outside!

608
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:25,877
Let go of me!

609
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:29,797
Let go of my arm!

610
00:34:31,674 --> 00:34:33,050
Shut up! Fuck off!

611
00:34:33,134 --> 00:34:35,887
That's gonna be real incognito
going in like that.

612
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,471
This is real brilliant. You're brilliant.

613
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:39,265
- Okay, why don't you just chill for now?
- Whatever.

614
00:34:39,348 --> 00:34:40,933
Would you like two beds in your room?

615
00:34:41,017 --> 00:34:43,186
No, no, we're not together. No.

616
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:47,607
Come on, baby. Don't be shy.
Just one bed, please.

617
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,151
- Hey!
- Come on, baby.

618
00:34:50,234 --> 00:34:52,737
You know I'm playing with your pretty ass.

619
00:34:53,154 --> 00:34:54,405
Let me ask you a question.

620
00:34:54,488 --> 00:34:56,616
Y'all really let hoochies like that
stay up in here?

621
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:59,285
I mean, 'cause y'all must be burning sheets
by the ton.

622
00:34:59,368 --> 00:35:00,411
Well...

623
00:35:00,494 --> 00:35:03,331
As a female, that shit right there
don't get you?

624
00:35:03,414 --> 00:35:07,710
Okay, it's bitches like that the reason
why niggas don't pay our species any mind!

625
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:11,047
They don't respect us!
Yeah, we just meat for male consumption.

626
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,798
Pieces of ass and pussy.

627
00:35:12,882 --> 00:35:15,593
Something pretty in lipstick and eyeliner
that can suck a fucking cock!

628
00:35:15,676 --> 00:35:17,512
- My ass!
- Shut up. What do you have to shout for?

629
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:19,346
She's asleep!
I'm trying to wake this bitch up! Man!

630
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:21,556
Come here! Come here!

631
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:25,560
Bitches like that
make me weep for what could be.

632
00:35:25,644 --> 00:35:29,356
If we all sisters everywhere, black, white,
brown and yellow,

633
00:35:29,439 --> 00:35:30,690
put our shit down one time,

634
00:35:30,774 --> 00:35:34,194
a unified front, you know, the female race,

635
00:35:34,277 --> 00:35:38,281
mobilised, baby, moving as one!
You feel me?

636
00:35:38,365 --> 00:35:39,950
I'm gonna need a minibar key, too.

637
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:50,710
MAN ON TAPE RECORDER: Say your name.
Then say, "How can I be of assistance?"

638
00:35:50,794 --> 00:35:53,088
VITOLl: I don't understand.

639
00:35:53,171 --> 00:35:56,174
I didn't ask for your understanding.

640
00:35:56,258 --> 00:35:59,094
I asked for your name,
followed by the phrase,

641
00:35:59,177 --> 00:36:01,888
"How can I be of assistance?"

642
00:36:01,972 --> 00:36:05,892
My name is Vitoli.
How can I be of assistance?

643
00:36:05,976 --> 00:36:07,269
Bravo.

644
00:36:11,064 --> 00:36:14,734
My name is Vitoli.
How can I be of assistance?

645
00:36:20,657 --> 00:36:27,622
My name is Vitoli.
How can I be of assistance?

646
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:33,003
My name is Vitoli.
How can I be of assistance?

647
00:36:35,422 --> 00:36:42,262
My name is Vitoli.
How can I be of assistance?

648
00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:47,183
Vitoli!

649
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:49,768
Vitoli!

650
00:36:50,102 --> 00:36:53,230
Let's go! What, your phone broke or what?

651
00:36:54,648 --> 00:36:56,817
Buddy wants you now up top.

652
00:36:58,652 --> 00:37:01,071
Where are you, you big nut?

653
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:03,782
Vitoli!

654
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:05,451
Come on, bitchy bitch.

655
00:37:06,952 --> 00:37:09,455
You open the fucking door.

656
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,043
Come on!

657
00:37:58,629 --> 00:38:00,881
ISRAEL: No, I tell you something.
You know what? Listen to me. Listen.

658
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:04,760
The deal is off in five minutes
unless they give us something.

659
00:38:04,844 --> 00:38:06,679
MECKLEN: I don't know what to say to you.
It is what it is.

660
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:08,388
- Bullshit! It isn't!
- Listen...

661
00:38:08,471 --> 00:38:11,850
I am not... I don't know how to say it
any fucking louder, Morrie.

662
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:13,101
I am not giving up my boys.

663
00:38:13,184 --> 00:38:15,186
- And they are bricking us...
- All right? End of fucking song.

664
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,397
...on that particular issue, pally.

665
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,026
I've been cohabitating with these people
for the last 30 hours.

666
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:26,614
These are the premier prick cocksuckers
of all time.

667
00:38:26,698 --> 00:38:29,617
And I feel beaten by them. I feel bloodied.

668
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:31,327
You're just gonna have to play ball.

669
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:34,622
No, I don't have to do shit, which includes
cooperating with these fuckers,

670
00:38:34,706 --> 00:38:36,374
until I get what I want!

671
00:38:39,711 --> 00:38:42,380
Listen to me.
If we have to give them someone,

672
00:38:42,463 --> 00:38:45,341
give them Hugo, all right?

673
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,721
I can take that because he needs that
regimented prison shit that they'll give him.

674
00:38:49,804 --> 00:38:52,974
It's bigger than that. They want everybody.

675
00:38:53,516 --> 00:38:56,186
Ivy, Beanie, Hugo, the works.

676
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:00,023
This is not a fucking swap meet,
all right, Morrie?

677
00:39:01,232 --> 00:39:03,026
I'm not giving up my boys
and you fucking know that.

678
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:04,194
I gave you Sparazza.

679
00:39:04,277 --> 00:39:06,905
I'm gonna give them Sparazza
and the west-coast syndicate gift-wrapped.

680
00:39:06,988 --> 00:39:08,489
Get it fucking done!

681
00:39:08,573 --> 00:39:13,077
Listen to me, kid.
Let's not antagonise this any more, okay?

682
00:39:13,161 --> 00:39:16,956
If we push this,
they are gonna revoke your protective status

683
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,250
and that nullifies any agreement we got.

684
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:21,669
And that is mate. Checkmate, kiddo.

685
00:39:55,035 --> 00:39:56,203
All right.

686
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,562
- Israel rolled!
- He's giving them all up, isn't he?

687
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:24,690
His entire entourage. He doesn't have
a friend in the world. We got to move.

688
00:40:24,773 --> 00:40:26,525
Son of a bitch. The Justice lawyers sign off?

689
00:40:26,608 --> 00:40:28,735
Yeah, that's happening.
Look, if he's gonna run,

690
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:29,945
he's gonna run now, so we got to go!

691
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:32,823
I'm gonna call security and make sure
the whole place is locked down.

692
00:40:32,906 --> 00:40:34,491
We got to keep him in that penthouse.

693
00:40:34,575 --> 00:40:36,827
ACOSTA: I'd like to take a look
at the penthouse.

694
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:40,873
No, I'm sorry, the penthouse
is currently under construction.

695
00:40:40,956 --> 00:40:42,791
MAN ON RADIO: Do a sweep
on camera three. Maybe we can pick him up.

696
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:46,628
Bill, can I speak to you privately?

697
00:40:46,837 --> 00:40:48,130
If you get a chance...

698
00:40:48,797 --> 00:40:52,426
Gary? Let's get our personnel up
on the catwalk over 12.

699
00:40:52,509 --> 00:40:54,428
I don't like the rolls
that table's been getting.

700
00:40:54,511 --> 00:40:55,846
It's tough, huh?

701
00:40:56,263 --> 00:40:58,639
This is tough. I don't know... This...
I don't know how you do this.

702
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,516
I mean,
you have to keep your eye on everything.

703
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,351
And everybody all the time.

704
00:41:02,435 --> 00:41:04,562
- Yeah, it can be a chore.
- I'll bet.

705
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:06,355
So, Bill, if I'm getting this right,

706
00:41:06,439 --> 00:41:09,358
so you currently have the penthouse level
under construction?

707
00:41:09,442 --> 00:41:10,610
- That's correct.
- Okay.

708
00:41:10,693 --> 00:41:15,239
But with these down,
doesn't that pose a major security concern?

709
00:41:15,323 --> 00:41:18,201
I mean, as you said, you got to keep
your eye on everything at all times.

710
00:41:18,284 --> 00:41:20,578
Well, we were worried
about the dust and debris from the work

711
00:41:20,661 --> 00:41:22,496
going on up there ruining the cameras.

712
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,123
- So you shut them off?
- Yes.

713
00:41:24,207 --> 00:41:28,753
Hey, Bill, you said there's some situation
on 12? It's table 12?

714
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:32,089
Table 12. Okay?
I need somebody over at table 12.

715
00:41:32,173 --> 00:41:36,636
A little blue-haired lady there
who's rolled about 14 times. Thank you.

716
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,888
Something happened at table 14?

717
00:41:40,306 --> 00:41:41,557
Table 12!

718
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:43,351
I got it.

719
00:41:44,894 --> 00:41:46,812
You shut them off.

720
00:41:46,896 --> 00:41:49,440
Yes. I mean, no, we...

721
00:41:49,524 --> 00:41:53,444
There's personnel stationed at both ends
of that hallway 24 hours a day.

722
00:41:53,528 --> 00:41:55,154
Okay. What kind of personnel?

723
00:41:55,238 --> 00:41:56,572
Right now?

724
00:41:57,073 --> 00:42:03,079
A six-man security force plus Vitoli,
our executive butler, so seven men, total.

725
00:42:03,162 --> 00:42:05,665
You have an executive butler on the floor?

726
00:42:05,748 --> 00:42:08,876
Just in terms
of the men that are up there now, my team,

727
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:13,923
serving lunch and dinner
and just generally doing upkeep.

728
00:42:14,006 --> 00:42:16,801
I'm not clear on the table. Is it table...
I'm at 12.

729
00:42:16,884 --> 00:42:19,637
I don't know what you're seeing
right now, Bill.

730
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:24,182
It's a little blue-haired lady.
I'm looking at her right now. Table 12!

731
00:42:24,266 --> 00:42:28,061
She is killing it, all right?
I want you to keep an eye on her! That's all!

732
00:42:28,353 --> 00:42:31,481
- It's got to be frustrating.
- Copy that. We got her now.

733
00:42:31,898 --> 00:42:34,734
- No guests, though, on the penthouse?
- No.

734
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,069
We have noticed a lot of action
on that table.

735
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,738
- Come on, Bill.
- We just want to know what's going on.

736
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,783
You got some sultan.

737
00:42:42,909 --> 00:42:46,162
- One of your whales.
- No.

738
00:42:46,246 --> 00:42:48,290
Big spender? Come on.

739
00:42:48,373 --> 00:42:49,624
- No, no.
- Likes a lot of space?

740
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:51,710
Did you cook up
this little construction thing?

741
00:42:51,793 --> 00:42:52,836
- Is this a...
- No, no.

742
00:42:52,919 --> 00:42:56,089
We've been looking to renovate
that area of our hotel for some time now.

743
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:59,009
The security in place
is solely to preserve floor integrity.

744
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:01,136
And who else has access to the floor, Bill?

745
00:43:03,597 --> 00:43:06,516
I'm sorry. We're covering
some very sensitive material here,

746
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,685
and I've got to safeguard myself,

747
00:43:08,768 --> 00:43:11,646
so if you could just show me
your ID again, get your clearance.

748
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,023
Of course, great. If you could just tell me

749
00:43:13,106 --> 00:43:14,941
who has access to the floor,
I think we could...

750
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:19,154
I have the sole pass and relieve
all of the personnel myself personally.

751
00:43:19,237 --> 00:43:21,781
- Now, if we can just see your ID...
- Absolutely.

752
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,579
Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?
I need to speak to security right away.

753
00:43:27,704 --> 00:43:32,667
This is Special Agent Donald Carruthers
of the FBI. Hello? Is anyone there? Hello?

754
00:43:35,795 --> 00:43:37,172
Is that

755
00:43:38,131 --> 00:43:39,299
blood?

756
00:43:39,841 --> 00:43:41,218
Yes, it is.

757
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,554
It's filling up your lungs right now.

758
00:43:45,554 --> 00:43:50,851
In less than a minute,
you're gonna asphyxiate and pass out.

759
00:43:51,143 --> 00:43:54,104
But you shouldn't be feeling any pain
right now, okay?

760
00:43:56,357 --> 00:43:58,567
Hey, hey.

761
00:44:00,486 --> 00:44:01,904
Close your eyes.

762
00:44:06,242 --> 00:44:07,743
Close your eyes.

763
00:44:08,744 --> 00:44:10,204
Close your eyes.

764
00:44:11,497 --> 00:44:15,960
Don't make this face
the last thing you ever see.

765
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:20,589
Because...

766
00:44:20,673 --> 00:44:24,426
Heaven may hold it against you.

767
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:26,846
Am I really dying?

768
00:44:28,472 --> 00:44:29,807
Bill.

769
00:44:31,809 --> 00:44:33,143
Yeah, William.

770
00:44:36,939 --> 00:44:38,774
We're all dying.

771
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,130
MESSNER: So it's a confirmed
double homicide.

772
00:45:01,213 --> 00:45:02,923
CARRUTHERS: Nobody from security
is picking up the line.

773
00:45:03,007 --> 00:45:05,968
Gunshot vics,
dumped in the lake, maybe an hour cold.

774
00:45:06,218 --> 00:45:07,344
You're on speakerphone.

775
00:45:07,428 --> 00:45:08,637
- AGENT: Am I on the speakerphone?
- Yeah, go, go, go, go.

776
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:10,638
We got an ID pending on a Jack Dupree.

777
00:45:10,722 --> 00:45:12,932
He's a bail bondsman
out of Las Vegas, Nevada.

778
00:45:13,016 --> 00:45:14,809
Did you recover anything from his person?

779
00:45:14,893 --> 00:45:16,436
We got a receipt out of his pocket.

780
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:18,396
- It was for a uniform rental.
- What kind of uniform?

781
00:45:18,479 --> 00:45:20,315
The receipt was partially destroyed
by the lake water.

782
00:45:20,398 --> 00:45:21,566
- What kind of uniforms?
- What kind of uniforms?

783
00:45:21,649 --> 00:45:23,234
It was listed as maroon in colour.

784
00:45:23,318 --> 00:45:24,819
CARRUTHERS: Maroon?
AGENT: Maroon.

785
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,615
- With maroon, that's Nomad security.
- Were these uniforms recovered?

786
00:45:28,698 --> 00:45:30,158
- No, we're still looking.
- Fuck!

787
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:32,619
Deputy? I need you...

788
00:45:32,702 --> 00:45:35,079
I need you to lock down...
I need you to limit physical activity...

789
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:39,000
- Is that clear?
- Nobody gets in the hotel.

790
00:45:39,167 --> 00:45:42,086
Nobody gets near the crime scene.
Make it happen, okay?

791
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,005
- Dupree was going in as security.
- Yep.

792
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:45,548
I'm gonna go over to the hotel.

793
00:45:45,632 --> 00:45:47,217
You take the car. You get over to the lake.

794
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,427
- You find out whatever you can.
- What are you gonna do?

795
00:45:49,511 --> 00:45:51,554
I'm gonna get to Israel before they do.

796
00:45:51,638 --> 00:45:53,598
- I don't think that's gonna work.
- And why?

797
00:45:53,681 --> 00:45:56,100
Because we don't need to bring any more
shit down on our heads.

798
00:45:56,184 --> 00:45:59,479
I'm saying we're gonna hit whoever's
between us and Israel. That's how I'm on it.

799
00:45:59,562 --> 00:46:00,897
I ain't trying to dead the whole floor

800
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,357
and I don't want to be killing no women.

801
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,650
No matter how they make their living.

802
00:46:03,733 --> 00:46:08,112
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm getting some
fucked-up feedback off of that earpiece.

803
00:46:10,865 --> 00:46:12,534
- That's better?
- Yeah, much.

804
00:46:12,617 --> 00:46:13,868
What you hearing right now?

805
00:46:13,952 --> 00:46:17,539
There was something about some
faggot-ass fed being up in the building.

806
00:46:18,081 --> 00:46:22,085
- A fed? Like FBI?
- Yeah. That's all right though. That's cool.

807
00:46:22,168 --> 00:46:24,671
It's just some little casino inspection.
Don't trip.

808
00:46:24,754 --> 00:46:29,342
All right, then. When them tricks
hit the lobby, I want you to holler at me.

809
00:46:29,425 --> 00:46:32,262
I'm gonna meet them on their way up,
blend in real nice.

810
00:46:33,137 --> 00:46:36,890
Once I'm inside, I'm puttin' chrome
to Israel's head and backing out hot.

811
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:38,767
Anybody get gully, you know.

812
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:40,686
I'm gonna grip and rip.

813
00:46:40,769 --> 00:46:43,897
I got some handloads up here
ready to put some niggas out. Trust me.

814
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:47,568
Just remember it's more
of a rescue than a rampage, all right?

815
00:46:47,693 --> 00:46:51,196
Hey, come on, man.
You know I had to bring big mama through.

816
00:46:52,531 --> 00:46:54,491
- You got the.50 up?
- Sure do.

817
00:46:54,575 --> 00:46:56,702
What the fuck?
What the fuck are you trying to shoot?

818
00:46:56,785 --> 00:46:57,828
A jumbo jet out of the sky?

819
00:46:57,911 --> 00:46:59,163
Blast down the moon?

820
00:46:59,246 --> 00:47:02,708
Any of these niggas make one false move,
these bitches taking dirt naps.

821
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:05,085
I ain't trying to be up here all day.
And I tell you what.

822
00:47:05,169 --> 00:47:08,422
That bitch-ass fed get in the way,
RIP, nigga.

823
00:47:12,467 --> 00:47:16,930
Fucking Kevlar, the way I had to stitch it,
this shit is itchy as hell.

824
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,695
Let me ask you a question.
You heard from that nigga, Keith?

825
00:47:31,778 --> 00:47:34,281
Or he still fucking
with that little light-skinned girl?

826
00:47:34,364 --> 00:47:36,825
I ain't trying to break a sweat off
of that motherfucker.

827
00:47:36,909 --> 00:47:38,994
Yeah, fuck that nigga, man.

828
00:47:39,077 --> 00:47:42,289
Anyway, we got each other.
That's all the love we ever gonna need.

829
00:47:42,372 --> 00:47:43,457
Feel me?

830
00:47:44,124 --> 00:47:45,959
You feel me, girl?

831
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,378
Oh, wait a minute.

832
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:51,507
I think the ho train just arrived.

833
00:47:52,966 --> 00:47:57,179
Damn! Four skank-ass bitches.
That's your crew.

834
00:47:57,262 --> 00:47:58,721
Hey, fuck you. All right.

835
00:47:58,804 --> 00:48:02,642
Fuck you and this fucking wig
'cause this shit is getting on my nerves.

836
00:48:03,893 --> 00:48:05,311
I'm on my way out.

837
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:11,984
I'm going to just chill in the hallway
until they come up in the elevator.

838
00:48:12,068 --> 00:48:13,486
And you let me know, all right?

839
00:48:15,696 --> 00:48:18,908
You just get up in there
and do your thing, baby girl.

840
00:48:18,991 --> 00:48:22,620
Mama's got your back.
Mama's got your back, baby.

841
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:28,668
SERNA: Buzzy? Buzz?

842
00:48:28,751 --> 00:48:31,504
- Yeah, it's me.
- All right, you got clicks? Anything?

843
00:48:31,587 --> 00:48:33,714
No, nothing on my end.

844
00:48:33,798 --> 00:48:36,634
- So, how we looking?
- Looks very good.

845
00:48:36,717 --> 00:48:38,344
Fucking thrilled to hear it.

846
00:48:38,427 --> 00:48:41,222
So, this sit-down, you must have felt it
from them then, huh?

847
00:48:41,305 --> 00:48:43,558
Cold blood, Sid. Dead eyes.

848
00:48:43,641 --> 00:48:47,395
Okay, yeah, good. So you're at the hotel.
Everything's all right?

849
00:48:47,478 --> 00:48:48,813
It's quiet.

850
00:48:48,896 --> 00:48:50,022
So, you're not seeing anything?

851
00:48:50,106 --> 00:48:52,900
No signs of trouble, nobody lurking,
no threats? Nothing?

852
00:48:52,984 --> 00:48:55,486
Absolutely no.
We got nothing to worry about.

853
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:57,196
Israel's in the penthouse now, right?

854
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,740
Yeah. I guess he's been holed up there
for a week or so.

855
00:48:59,824 --> 00:49:01,826
- How are we on time?
- The Swede's been dispatched.

856
00:49:01,909 --> 00:49:02,952
He's flying himself.

857
00:49:03,035 --> 00:49:06,873
All right, damn, all right.
So he's headed to Tahoe then, huh?

858
00:49:06,956 --> 00:49:09,375
Yeah. We're in a bit of a footrace
right now, Buzzy.

859
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:14,005
It's a matter of who outhustles who,
you know? We just got to get to Israel first.

860
00:49:14,088 --> 00:49:15,256
It's getting done, Sid.

861
00:49:15,339 --> 00:49:19,552
We got to get him, Buzz. Everything,
and I mean everything is riding on this.

862
00:49:19,635 --> 00:49:23,263
We're gonna get Israel. Trust me.

863
00:49:32,314 --> 00:49:34,900
HUGO ON RECORDER:
You open the fucking door.

864
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,608
AGENT: I'm sorry, sir.

865
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:17,984
But this is eyes only.

866
00:50:18,068 --> 00:50:19,945
They told me to hand deliver.

867
00:50:36,127 --> 00:50:37,796
Where did this come from?

868
00:50:38,088 --> 00:50:40,674
They dug it up in archives
as part of the Sparazza investigation.

869
00:50:58,941 --> 00:51:00,150
Has anyone else seen this?

870
00:51:00,234 --> 00:51:04,071
Only the Director himself.
He asked that you contact him immediately.

871
00:51:05,322 --> 00:51:08,159
Should we inform Messner and Carruthers?

872
00:51:09,827 --> 00:51:12,621
No. Things have changed.

873
00:51:12,705 --> 00:51:14,081
Get the Director on the phone

874
00:51:14,165 --> 00:51:16,417
and have our jet at the tarmac at LAX
in half an hour.

875
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,585
Yes, sir.

876
00:51:28,929 --> 00:51:30,014
Officer!

877
00:51:30,598 --> 00:51:32,808
- Hugo, what's happening, man?
- Right.

878
00:51:33,058 --> 00:51:35,352
Well, yeah, hey, you're good to go in.

879
00:52:13,932 --> 00:52:16,559
Hey, man. Where the fuck Vitoli at?

880
00:52:19,687 --> 00:52:23,816
The fuck do you mean? I ain't trying
to clean this shit up myself, dawg.

881
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,361
Hey, don't even think I'm touching
my man's coat

882
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:29,489
that I know you nutted all over,
you no-aiming ass.

883
00:52:29,864 --> 00:52:33,034
Man, what the fuck was you thinking,
barebacking them bitches, Hugo?

884
00:52:33,117 --> 00:52:37,121
I bet you your dick is disintegrating
as we speak, player!

885
00:52:37,539 --> 00:52:41,543
Stupid-ass motherfucker.
Now, what the fuck is wrong with you, man?

886
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:42,710
Hugo!

887
00:53:34,721 --> 00:53:36,805
So, what did Mecklen have to say?

888
00:53:38,223 --> 00:53:39,933
They're getting close, man.

889
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:44,313
Got about a handful of deal points
and then we're getting close.

890
00:53:45,063 --> 00:53:47,065
What are you shaking for, man?

891
00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:51,612
- But it's all good, right?
- Yeah.

892
00:53:55,449 --> 00:53:59,870
- Look at me, man. Look at me.
- What's up? I'm working.

893
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:03,040
- Yeah, okay.
- What's up?

894
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:05,959
You believe in loyalty, don't you?

895
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:07,586
Do I believe in loyalty?

896
00:54:07,669 --> 00:54:09,713
Especially the kind of loyalty

897
00:54:09,796 --> 00:54:13,175
where an otherwise sensible motherfucker
like myself

898
00:54:13,258 --> 00:54:15,969
- put his own best interests aside...
- That's why you're my man.

899
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:18,180
'Cause outside a goddamn dog,

900
00:54:18,931 --> 00:54:21,433
that kind of loyalty, my kind of shit,

901
00:54:22,643 --> 00:54:24,645
don't get no more dedicated

902
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:26,605
- or devout.
- What are you trying to say?

903
00:54:26,688 --> 00:54:29,566
What I've been saying. I need to get
your head of security right now.

904
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,610
He's not picking up the extension.

905
00:54:31,693 --> 00:54:33,487
I know that. What floor are they on?

906
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,989
- I don't know right now.
- What floor are they on, Ricky?

907
00:54:36,073 --> 00:54:39,201
Okay, you know,
that's one of our guys right over there.

908
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,495
Excuse me?

909
00:54:44,998 --> 00:54:46,291
Excuse me?

910
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:48,168
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

911
00:54:48,252 --> 00:54:50,045
Special Agent Donald Carruthers, FBI.

912
00:54:50,128 --> 00:54:52,089
I need to get to
your penthouse level immediately.

913
00:54:52,172 --> 00:54:53,549
Well, I'm headed there right now. Sure.

914
00:54:53,632 --> 00:54:56,134
- Is this an emergency?
- Let's hope not.

915
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,652
I'm going down.

916
00:55:15,319 --> 00:55:16,863
I'll bet you are.

917
00:55:23,578 --> 00:55:25,246
Faggot-ass redneck.

918
00:55:27,081 --> 00:55:28,291
What'd you say?

919
00:55:28,374 --> 00:55:30,126
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator.

920
00:55:30,209 --> 00:55:33,212
Are these bitches
on a permanent smoke break or what?

921
00:55:33,754 --> 00:55:37,341
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
The ho train has left the station.

922
00:55:37,425 --> 00:55:38,759
Yeah, they're headed straight to you.

923
00:55:38,843 --> 00:55:40,553
- Good.
- Skank-ass bitches.

924
00:55:40,636 --> 00:55:42,388
But that's the role you wanted to play.

925
00:55:42,471 --> 00:55:44,640
Yeah, that says a whole lot about you.

926
00:55:44,724 --> 00:55:46,726
A ho, ho lot.

927
00:55:54,442 --> 00:55:56,068
What up, G?

928
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:59,947
Speak, come on. Speak up.

929
00:56:00,031 --> 00:56:02,575
Bitch, I'm about to ball this.

930
00:56:03,075 --> 00:56:06,412
Okay, then. Punk.

931
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:07,747
No, it was not made clear to me.

932
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:08,873
This is the first I'm hearing of it.

933
00:56:08,956 --> 00:56:11,125
Have you contacted Agent Carruthers?

934
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:14,629
Yeah, cell reception up here is terrible,
but until you or I speak with him,

935
00:56:14,712 --> 00:56:16,547
he's the SAC and he's the guy I answer to...

936
00:56:16,631 --> 00:56:18,007
REPORTER: As to the identity
of the two bodies...

937
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:19,592
Look, in less than an hour,
you're gonna have

938
00:56:19,675 --> 00:56:21,928
40 to 50-odd field agents
arriving in Lake Tahoe

939
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:23,387
without the slightest clue as to why.

940
00:56:23,471 --> 00:56:25,764
We are instructed to take Israel
into protective custody.

941
00:56:25,847 --> 00:56:26,932
That's a two-man operation.

942
00:56:27,015 --> 00:56:29,100
What you're describing now
is a much larger movement.

943
00:56:29,184 --> 00:56:31,645
- Messner?
- Listen. Hold it. I need to speak with Locke.

944
00:56:31,728 --> 00:56:32,812
Get him on the phone.

945
00:56:32,896 --> 00:56:34,689
If the situation's changed,
I need to hear it from him.

946
00:56:34,773 --> 00:56:36,274
- You Messner?
- Yeah. Who's this?

947
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:38,652
Take a look at that. Hollis Elmore.
Vegas resident.

948
00:56:38,735 --> 00:56:39,820
Used to be with the PD down there.

949
00:56:39,903 --> 00:56:41,696
Agent Messner, we recovered the car.

950
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:45,450
- What car?
- Dupree's car. '89 Cadillac Sedan DeVille.

951
00:56:45,534 --> 00:56:48,620
- Where did you find it?
- Parking structure at the Nomad.

952
00:57:04,344 --> 00:57:05,846
Are the overheads necessary?

953
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:08,181
Turn the overheads off! Now!

954
00:57:08,265 --> 00:57:10,767
- Not exactly low profile, is this?
- No, sir.

955
00:57:10,851 --> 00:57:12,102
Hotel locked down at all?

956
00:57:12,185 --> 00:57:14,354
I couldn't tell you that right now, sir.

957
00:57:14,437 --> 00:57:16,940
Hugo, what the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

958
00:57:17,566 --> 00:57:22,445
What, you stuck on stupid or something?
I know. You rode a little bus to school.

959
00:57:22,988 --> 00:57:27,033
Hey, man, stop using that fucking lotion,
man. You look like a damn Muppet.

960
00:57:27,742 --> 00:57:29,703
And don't let your bitch cut your hair
no more, dawg.

961
00:57:29,786 --> 00:57:32,747
It look like she put a bowl
on that shit, man. Damn.

962
00:57:32,831 --> 00:57:36,001
Hey, but you need to bring your ass
down here and help me out, Hugo, for real.

963
00:57:36,084 --> 00:57:38,211
I ain't cleaning all this shit up myself, man.

964
00:57:38,295 --> 00:57:41,047
I'm tired.
I ain't no fucking cleaning lady, dawg.

965
00:57:41,131 --> 00:57:44,509
For real. Bring your ass down here. Shit.

966
00:57:55,978 --> 00:57:57,062
What the fuck?

967
00:57:59,899 --> 00:58:02,401
Hell, no. You didn't do that, dawg.

968
00:58:07,615 --> 00:58:09,450
What'd you say to Mecklen?

969
00:58:10,242 --> 00:58:13,913
What I've always been saying,
let's make the fucking deal.

970
00:58:14,663 --> 00:58:15,873
You see,

971
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:20,336
this is one of them rare moments
where your ass get a chance

972
00:58:20,419 --> 00:58:21,587
to be completely honest.

973
00:58:24,006 --> 00:58:28,052
If I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen,
assume the shit is rhetorical.

974
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:30,554
Assume I already know.

975
00:58:32,348 --> 00:58:34,141
What do you see right now?

976
00:58:35,142 --> 00:58:38,312
You see exactly and only

977
00:58:39,188 --> 00:58:44,109
what I choose to show you.
That is illusion, Ivy.

978
00:58:44,276 --> 00:58:49,073
That is the lie that I tell your eyes.
Making the magic happen

979
00:58:49,156 --> 00:58:53,536
in the moment, in that split second,

980
00:58:53,786 --> 00:58:57,623
but seeing behind this motherfucker
and knowing

981
00:59:00,543 --> 00:59:03,337
- that it's all bullshit.
- Yeah, you're on some bullshit.

982
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:07,591
But I can shape it, I can shift it,
I can make it as real as this room.

983
00:59:07,675 --> 00:59:11,720
That's why I'm valuable here, Ivy.
And that is why you are not.

984
00:59:11,804 --> 00:59:13,805
- I ain't valuable?
- I am sorry.

985
00:59:13,888 --> 00:59:17,267
I love you. I never wanted it
to be like this. You know that.

986
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:21,396
It don't matter what you wanted.
It's what you did.

987
00:59:22,438 --> 00:59:25,400
If you thought old man Primo
could twist your shit up,

988
00:59:27,318 --> 00:59:29,904
wait till you see what I'm about to do here.

989
01:00:00,977 --> 01:00:02,520
I don't believe this.

990
01:00:05,815 --> 01:00:07,817
Battery's completely dead.

991
01:00:09,986 --> 01:00:13,990
Forget it. You won't get a signal in here.
You'll have to wait.

992
01:00:14,491 --> 01:00:17,744
What about that line?
Can't you contact your people with that?

993
01:00:17,827 --> 01:00:20,455
No, these phones
are hardwired directly to maintenance,

994
01:00:20,538 --> 01:00:22,790
but once we reach the penthouse,
I can call down.

995
01:00:22,874 --> 01:00:25,376
I'll have the elevators taken offline, sir.

996
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,007
LOCKE: Pasquale Acosta.

997
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:34,344
Blood-money mercenary. El Estrago.

998
01:00:35,178 --> 01:00:36,512
The Plague.

999
01:00:37,262 --> 01:00:39,848
When he was caught by the SAS in Belfast.

1000
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:43,018
And in prison,
he chewed off his fingertips to the bone.

1001
01:00:48,774 --> 01:00:50,776
Why don't you have maintenance do it?

1002
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:54,279
- Do what, sir?
- Shut the elevator down.

1003
01:00:54,363 --> 01:00:57,699
An emergency shutdown
of our entire elevated lift system, sir?

1004
01:00:57,783 --> 01:00:59,827
No. That has to be handled by my staff, sir.

1005
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:14,883
How long have you been working here?

1006
01:01:16,009 --> 01:01:17,344
Bill?

1007
01:01:20,556 --> 01:01:24,226
MAN: Oh, my God, I need an ambulance
for Bill! I'm in the security room.

1008
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:42,244
- Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
- No, no.

1009
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:43,912
But that definitely sounds like gunshots,

1010
01:01:43,996 --> 01:01:45,330
and I don't know where it's coming from.

1011
01:01:45,414 --> 01:01:47,249
It's your IFB, man.
Somebody got a earpiece.

1012
01:01:47,332 --> 01:01:48,667
You just picking up their signal.

1013
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:51,587
We need Nomad hotel security
to lock down the elevators immediately.

1014
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:54,715
Girl. Please don't tell me
this motherfucker just went off.

1015
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:57,217
- Man, these fools.
- What? What's wrong? What?

1016
01:01:57,301 --> 01:02:01,095
Man, fucking security's shutting down
the elevators in your building.

1017
01:02:04,682 --> 01:02:05,766
AUTOMATED VOICE: Please remain calm.

1018
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:06,934
Now that's the power, there.

1019
01:02:07,018 --> 01:02:11,564
Elevator service has been temporarily
suspended and will resume momentarily.

1020
01:02:12,231 --> 01:02:13,858
Please remain calm.

1021
01:02:13,941 --> 01:02:18,446
Elevator service has been temporarily
suspended and will resume momentarily.

1022
01:02:18,529 --> 01:02:20,364
Well, let's get on it, then.

1023
01:02:31,792 --> 01:02:34,003
- I wanna pick them down there.
- In the elevator.

1024
01:02:34,795 --> 01:02:38,216
More duct. Come on, more duct.
A little more duct.

1025
01:02:45,473 --> 01:02:47,141
That's how we do!

1026
01:02:47,975 --> 01:02:49,811
Now, okay, okay.

1027
01:02:49,894 --> 01:02:55,358
Now, I'm a registered nurse
and this was my bath not a half hour ago.

1028
01:02:56,692 --> 01:02:59,153
Whoopsie. We'll take care of that.

1029
01:02:59,237 --> 01:03:02,573
Hey, Boogie! I need you to go in,

1030
01:03:02,657 --> 01:03:05,368
get my heating pad, get my blanket.

1031
01:03:05,451 --> 01:03:09,038
- Nana, not during training.
- Okay, Grandma's big helper boy?

1032
01:03:09,121 --> 01:03:11,582
Nana, Nana. Nana?

1033
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:14,001
Grandma will get it. Go on.

1034
01:03:14,085 --> 01:03:16,003
Little angel butt.

1035
01:03:16,087 --> 01:03:18,548
I feel like you're eyeballing me, dawg!

1036
01:03:19,799 --> 01:03:21,926
I don't like punk bitches eyeballing me.

1037
01:03:22,009 --> 01:03:25,303
You got beef? You got beef?
You want some of this? Yeah.

1038
01:03:34,563 --> 01:03:36,064
What? What?

1039
01:03:36,815 --> 01:03:39,151
See? Skills. Skills.

1040
01:03:44,781 --> 01:03:46,366
Fucking stop it.

1041
01:03:53,498 --> 01:03:54,583
Yeah!

1042
01:03:56,877 --> 01:03:59,004
FEMALE REPORTER: The two men
were slain here earlier today,

1043
01:03:59,087 --> 01:04:01,965
as authorities speculate as to
the apparent disappearance of a third.

1044
01:04:02,048 --> 01:04:04,176
The name of one victim is being withheld,

1045
01:04:04,259 --> 01:04:07,304
but the other victim in being identified
as Jack Dupree...

1046
01:04:07,387 --> 01:04:12,225
Oh, shit. Goddamn it!
Son of a fucking bitch! Fuck!

1047
01:04:12,309 --> 01:04:15,020
MALE REPORTER:
The vehicle registered in Mr Dupree's name

1048
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:18,648
has been recovered in the parking lot
of the Nomad Hotel and Casino.

1049
01:04:19,024 --> 01:04:22,027
Don, if you can hear this,
I'm in the hotel, north side.

1050
01:04:22,903 --> 01:04:24,863
I changed lives for you.

1051
01:04:26,323 --> 01:04:29,659
You ain't never had to wash
another man's blood off,

1052
01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:33,788
dig it out of your fingernails.
You had us for that.

1053
01:04:34,372 --> 01:04:37,125
You ain't never made no real beef
on your own.

1054
01:04:37,709 --> 01:04:39,794
Shit, as light in the ass as you are,

1055
01:04:39,878 --> 01:04:41,671
bet you ain't never had to make
nothing more

1056
01:04:41,755 --> 01:04:44,007
- than a fucking fist your whole life.
- Ivy...

1057
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:47,844
So if you think I'm gonna let
your little punk ass with the dirt I done...

1058
01:04:47,928 --> 01:04:49,012
Listen to me.

1059
01:04:49,095 --> 01:04:51,472
...sell me off like a fucking field nigga...

1060
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:54,183
- You know I wouldn't.
...hand me to the feds like your last chip...

1061
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:55,643
Whatever you think, whatever...

1062
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:58,145
You must be out of your fucking mind.

1063
01:04:58,229 --> 01:04:59,313
If you...

1064
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:00,564
Motherfuck! Motherfucker!

1065
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:05,444
You're out of your fucking mind!

1066
01:05:05,528 --> 01:05:06,904
You fucked up...

1067
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,407
You're fucked up, Ivy!

1068
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:11,617
- Hugo! You hit?
- No! No, no, no!

1069
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:15,162
- Mr Israel!
- I'm in here! Ivy's trying to kill me!

1070
01:05:15,246 --> 01:05:17,039
- Motherfuck you!
- Fuck you!

1071
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:18,415
- Get in here!
- Come on.

1072
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,210
Shit.

1073
01:05:21,293 --> 01:05:23,963
Drop that goddamn gun now
or you're a dead man!

1074
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:27,758
Jesus Christ. Beanie's dead.

1075
01:05:39,145 --> 01:05:40,771
You murdered Beanie.

1076
01:05:40,855 --> 01:05:44,400
Put the guns down. He's got nothing.
Get him out of here.

1077
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:46,110
- Jimmy, cuff him.
- Put him in...

1078
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:48,154
Take him to the service exit. It's quick.

1079
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,739
Get back here. We'll handle the rest of it.
You all right, Hugo?

1080
01:05:50,823 --> 01:05:53,534
- He's fine.
- He's giving us up to the feds, Hugo!

1081
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:55,202
Yo, get out of here, Hugo, man!

1082
01:05:55,286 --> 01:05:57,496
He working with them people, Hugo!

1083
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:00,291
It's all bullshit. You know that, Hugo.

1084
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:02,877
You all right? You stay with me.
Stay with me.

1085
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,297
Mecklen's gonna call any second, all right?
All right? You with me?

1086
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,132
You with me, baby? Huh?

1087
01:06:10,676 --> 01:06:12,136
We're almost home.

1088
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:25,773
These two are down.

1089
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:27,734
What the fuck is going on?

1090
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,991
Come on, you fucker.

1091
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:39,996
WATTERS: Forget it. It's done.

1092
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,581
Hey, quit saying that, all right?

1093
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:44,709
Girl, I just saw muzzle flashes
coming from that suite.

1094
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:47,837
That's probably
where you heard the shots earlier.

1095
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:50,590
Somebody just deaded Israel's ass.
It's a wrap.

1096
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:54,636
I ain't come all this way just to pack it up
because you thinking something up.

1097
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,764
Whatever, man. We can bounce out,
chill for a little bit.

1098
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,391
Shoot a little craps. Maybe spend the night.

1099
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:12,195
Come on, baby, look.
We could break down now...

1100
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:13,696
Shit, girl.

1101
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:14,864
What?

1102
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:20,036
These two dudes
just sitting in the elevator, all shot up.

1103
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:24,082
Whatever it was, it got way past words.

1104
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:25,750
What are they doing right now?

1105
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,545
Dying.

1106
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:32,882
So, them fellas, the ones that was shot
and tossed into the lake?

1107
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:35,134
Them police officers, too?

1108
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:43,058
Them are left over after my hysterectomy,
so they'd be a few years old.

1109
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,102
I'm not gay because I have a beard.

1110
01:07:45,185 --> 01:07:46,854
My fingers are cut off.

1111
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:48,730
Poor me.

1112
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:52,067
Warren, go and practise
your nunchakus now.

1113
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:54,069
Leave us be alone, shug.

1114
01:08:07,749 --> 01:08:09,209
Go on, now, shug.

1115
01:08:09,293 --> 01:08:11,253
Anytime, anytime, fag.

1116
01:08:11,336 --> 01:08:13,255
I am sorry about that boy.

1117
01:08:13,338 --> 01:08:15,799
His mama abandoned him
going on a year now

1118
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,551
and his daddy, my boy Dale,

1119
01:08:17,634 --> 01:08:21,013
he's over at the Reno-Washoe
Correctional Facility.

1120
01:08:21,805 --> 01:08:23,891
Got some clarity issues.

1121
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:26,935
Did some home-invasion,
sodomy-torture type stuff.

1122
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:28,896
Wrote a bunch of bad cheques.

1123
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:32,816
My husband, Bill, committed suicide
by hanging about nine months back.

1124
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:36,570
And ever since then, little Boogie there
has been man of the house.

1125
01:08:39,072 --> 01:08:41,742
I don't think that's been opened
since my husband died.

1126
01:08:41,825 --> 01:08:44,369
I might just borrow this for a little while.

1127
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:46,455
MESSNER: Your IFB working?

1128
01:08:46,538 --> 01:08:47,581
No, that's why we're on walkies.

1129
01:08:47,664 --> 01:08:48,957
Jurisdiction's a nightmare right now.

1130
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,501
- Anything more on Dupree's car?
- Nothing.

1131
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:53,295
You mean to tell me that nobody noticed
anyone getting out of a Cadillac

1132
01:08:53,378 --> 01:08:54,463
that looked like a wiffle ball?

1133
01:08:54,546 --> 01:08:55,589
- I know.
- Where's your guy?

1134
01:08:55,672 --> 01:08:56,715
Right here.

1135
01:08:56,798 --> 01:08:57,883
Ricky, this is Agent Messner.

1136
01:08:57,966 --> 01:08:59,927
Tell him exactly what happened,
nice and slow.

1137
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:03,429
Yeah, so, earlier,
there was that guy, Carruthers...

1138
01:09:03,513 --> 01:09:04,972
Yeah, Agent Carruthers.
Do you know where he is?

1139
01:09:05,056 --> 01:09:06,474
- No. He wanted to know...
- Yeah, he's here right now.

1140
01:09:06,557 --> 01:09:07,642
We're talking to the kid.
We need about two minutes.

1141
01:09:07,725 --> 01:09:08,810
...which floor security was on.

1142
01:09:08,893 --> 01:09:11,229
And then later I saw him get on the elevator
with the other agent.

1143
01:09:11,312 --> 01:09:12,730
Wait, hold on. Wait a minute.
What other agent?

1144
01:09:12,814 --> 01:09:15,066
There were no other agents.
Our agents are landing here now.

1145
01:09:15,149 --> 01:09:17,026
- There was nobody here.
- He said he was from San Francisco.

1146
01:09:17,109 --> 01:09:18,861
Did he give you a name?

1147
01:09:18,945 --> 01:09:21,197
Spanish something. It was Diego or Garcia.

1148
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,990
Yeah, run both those names
through the DC database.

1149
01:09:23,074 --> 01:09:24,158
Something stinks here.

1150
01:09:24,242 --> 01:09:25,409
Call San Francisco. See if they...

1151
01:09:25,493 --> 01:09:27,328
You know,
he was wearing one of our jackets.

1152
01:09:27,411 --> 01:09:28,663
- What?
- Who was?

1153
01:09:28,746 --> 01:09:31,332
The other agent.
He said he was here to do some inspections.

1154
01:09:31,415 --> 01:09:33,626
Then later, when I saw him get on
the elevator with Carruthers...

1155
01:09:33,709 --> 01:09:35,711
This man identified himself
as a federal agent?

1156
01:09:35,795 --> 01:09:36,963
Yeah, I mean, he had the badge
and everything.

1157
01:09:37,046 --> 01:09:39,924
And when you saw him later,
he was wearing one of your security jackets.

1158
01:09:40,007 --> 01:09:41,175
Yeah.

1159
01:09:42,468 --> 01:09:44,637
And that didn't seem odd to you?

1160
01:09:45,471 --> 01:09:47,515
I mean, I thought they gave it to him
so he could...

1161
01:09:47,598 --> 01:09:48,808
Walk with me.

1162
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:53,020
Okay, so obviously,
we got a man posing as one of us.

1163
01:09:53,354 --> 01:09:56,524
Make your team aware,
but do it quietly. Okay?

1164
01:09:59,277 --> 01:10:00,444
Fuck it.

1165
01:10:01,028 --> 01:10:03,364
Okay, now let's get
a tactical team assembled. We're going up.

1166
01:10:03,447 --> 01:10:05,074
Okay, we need to get
these elevators powered up.

1167
01:10:05,158 --> 01:10:06,200
All right, maintenance,

1168
01:10:06,284 --> 01:10:08,119
I need somebody
to power up these elevators immediately.

1169
01:10:08,202 --> 01:10:11,247
I need to get Deputy Director Locke
on a hard line as soon as possible.

1170
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:12,373
All right, done.

1171
01:10:12,456 --> 01:10:13,499
Come on, step back, step back.

1172
01:10:13,624 --> 01:10:15,084
- Come on...
- Are you kidding?

1173
01:10:24,427 --> 01:10:26,636
I thought you were gonna go...

1174
01:10:27,137 --> 01:10:30,432
Gonna go down and get Vitoli.
Get him back up here.

1175
01:10:30,724 --> 01:10:31,933
We gotta...

1176
01:10:32,601 --> 01:10:34,269
We gotta pack up.

1177
01:10:35,061 --> 01:10:36,771
We gotta pack it up now.

1178
01:10:37,939 --> 01:10:41,401
Bring him up here. We gotta get packed up.
We're gonna pack it up.

1179
01:10:41,485 --> 01:10:44,154
All right? Where is he?

1180
01:10:44,946 --> 01:10:47,908
- WATTERS: He's dead.
- No, I said dying, not dead.

1181
01:10:48,283 --> 01:10:49,367
Shit.

1182
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:54,289
Shit, girl.

1183
01:10:54,748 --> 01:10:56,333
One of them is a fed.

1184
01:10:57,042 --> 01:10:58,877
Hello, did you hear me?
Did you hear what I said?

1185
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,420
I said one of them has got a FBI badge.

1186
01:11:00,504 --> 01:11:02,255
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold up, hold up.

1187
01:11:02,339 --> 01:11:04,049
I'm getting all kinds of shit
over this scanner.

1188
01:11:04,132 --> 01:11:06,843
- Just chill for a second.
- AGENT: Shots fired. West tower. Nomad...

1189
01:11:12,057 --> 01:11:13,725
All right, hold on.

1190
01:11:14,434 --> 01:11:17,896
Just lay still for a minute.
Let me figure out... What the fuck...

1191
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:19,731
Get out of the way.

1192
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,324
Fuck.

1193
01:11:31,076 --> 01:11:32,536
You ain't gonna believe this shit.

1194
01:11:34,996 --> 01:11:36,540
Both these motherfuckers is feds.

1195
01:11:36,623 --> 01:11:37,791
No. One of them is not.

1196
01:11:37,874 --> 01:11:40,210
One of them is bullshit.
It's all over the air here.

1197
01:11:40,293 --> 01:11:43,421
They got a impostor.
Some fool with a fake badge.

1198
01:11:43,505 --> 01:11:46,716
You think it might be that motherfucker
that Loretta was telling us about? Soot?

1199
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,970
Wait. Hold up, hold up.
What I got here is a Gerald Diego.

1200
01:11:52,471 --> 01:11:53,764
A Donald Carruthers.

1201
01:11:54,014 --> 01:11:57,977
Which one of them is for real?
'Cause I'm gonna kill the one that ain't.

1202
01:11:58,477 --> 01:12:01,063
Stop the elevator. Stop the elevator.

1203
01:12:15,452 --> 01:12:16,537
Come on.

1204
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:56,035
They revoked the deal.

1205
01:12:56,202 --> 01:12:58,496
They revoked the deal. They pulled it.

1206
01:12:58,829 --> 01:13:00,873
Wait, wait. What do you mean?
What do you mean, man?

1207
01:13:00,956 --> 01:13:03,083
We got it, we got 'em, we got 'em.
What do you mean?

1208
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:06,921
I don't know. It was the Deputy Director.
That prick, Locke.

1209
01:13:07,421 --> 01:13:09,757
He just smashed everything.
He wouldn't tell me why.

1210
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,925
We're done.

1211
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:13,552
They're yanking us, Buddy.

1212
01:13:14,678 --> 01:13:18,097
They killed us. They killed us.

1213
01:14:13,236 --> 01:14:14,904
Three minutes.

1214
01:14:20,618 --> 01:14:22,203
Prepare to move.

1215
01:14:34,257 --> 01:14:35,675
North elevator door's open.

1216
01:14:35,758 --> 01:14:38,052
Possible aggression inside.
Check your fire.

1217
01:14:38,136 --> 01:14:39,595
Clear on my mark.

1218
01:14:40,888 --> 01:14:42,389
Shar. Shar seven,

1219
01:14:42,473 --> 01:14:43,765
I'm pinched.

1220
01:14:44,516 --> 01:14:45,976
Bring some heavy shit.

1221
01:14:46,059 --> 01:14:47,895
Fire from the sky. My count.

1222
01:14:48,228 --> 01:14:49,563
Bet.

1223
01:16:12,687 --> 01:16:14,522
Oh, my God.

1224
01:16:37,628 --> 01:16:38,963
SYKESS: Bring it.

1225
01:17:04,989 --> 01:17:06,699
Get the fuck down!

1226
01:17:09,619 --> 01:17:10,703
Get down!

1227
01:17:14,499 --> 01:17:17,168
Put your fucking hands in the air!

1228
01:17:17,251 --> 01:17:18,961
Throw your weapons down!

1229
01:17:19,545 --> 01:17:21,255
Step out of the elevator!

1230
01:17:21,339 --> 01:17:23,841
- Are these feds fake or real?
- I don't know!

1231
01:17:24,008 --> 01:17:25,593
Please, Sharice!

1232
01:17:28,054 --> 01:17:29,721
Oh, shit! I'm shot!

1233
01:17:32,015 --> 01:17:33,266
Georgia!

1234
01:17:38,396 --> 01:17:41,191
Georgia, where are you?
I can't fucking hear you.

1235
01:17:50,408 --> 01:17:51,910
How bad?

1236
01:17:52,494 --> 01:17:54,287
- Mortal.
- What?

1237
01:17:55,038 --> 01:17:56,748
- Mortal.
- No.

1238
01:17:56,998 --> 01:17:58,333
Fuck!

1239
01:17:58,458 --> 01:18:00,252
Secure these suspects!

1240
01:18:04,172 --> 01:18:07,592
I need medical assistance.
I got multiple officers down.

1241
01:18:08,343 --> 01:18:09,928
- Watch him.
- You're okay. No, no. Stay awake.

1242
01:18:10,971 --> 01:18:14,141
Get me a medic! Get me a fucking medic!

1243
01:18:14,975 --> 01:18:17,269
- Where's that medic?
- Fuck.

1244
01:18:17,352 --> 01:18:19,479
If you can hear me, girl,
I can't see shit from where I am.

1245
01:18:19,563 --> 01:18:20,939
I'm moving down for a better sight line.

1246
01:18:21,022 --> 01:18:24,693
I got officers down.
Repeat, on the seventh floor, officers down.

1247
01:18:24,776 --> 01:18:25,861
Let me isolate the...

1248
01:18:25,944 --> 01:18:29,322
Never mind! Just get in there.
Get in there and pin that girl!

1249
01:18:29,698 --> 01:18:33,034
Sharice? Can you hear me? I'm hit.

1250
01:18:33,618 --> 01:18:34,995
Oh, shit.

1251
01:18:35,078 --> 01:18:37,497
I don't know how bad this is. Shit.

1252
01:18:37,581 --> 01:18:39,332
That shit probably got through that Kevlar.

1253
01:18:44,796 --> 01:18:46,298
It's on the way up to the penthouse.

1254
01:19:17,828 --> 01:19:19,163
Lester!

1255
01:19:20,998 --> 01:19:22,082
Fuck.

1256
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:52,988
- Move! Move! Hurry!
- Clear the valet area.

1257
01:19:55,074 --> 01:19:56,450
Fuck. Come on!

1258
01:19:56,534 --> 01:19:57,910
AGENT: Left side of the building's
sealed off.

1259
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:00,955
Goddamn. Can you hear me?

1260
01:20:02,373 --> 01:20:04,083
Get this shit off!

1261
01:20:04,792 --> 01:20:05,960
Move!

1262
01:20:12,466 --> 01:20:13,884
Girl, where are you?

1263
01:20:16,886 --> 01:20:19,139
God damn it, Georgia! Just say something!

1264
01:20:32,277 --> 01:20:33,403
Mother...

1265
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:38,449
Fuck!

1266
01:20:41,286 --> 01:20:42,370
I'm hit!

1267
01:20:47,917 --> 01:20:49,711
We need a medic!

1268
01:20:50,086 --> 01:20:51,171
Fuck!

1269
01:20:51,754 --> 01:20:52,964
Fuck!

1270
01:20:53,673 --> 01:20:54,716
Get me a medic!

1271
01:20:54,799 --> 01:20:57,051
I need a medic. I need a medic.

1272
01:21:01,764 --> 01:21:03,433
Somebody get him out of there!

1273
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:08,563
I fucked up.

1274
01:21:09,272 --> 01:21:12,233
I fucked up!

1275
01:22:01,698 --> 01:22:03,534
I got three coming down now.

1276
01:22:14,753 --> 01:22:16,421
Go! Move. Move.

1277
01:22:21,176 --> 01:22:22,845
Forgive me.

1278
01:22:25,305 --> 01:22:26,932
Get your hands up!

1279
01:22:30,936 --> 01:22:32,855
Check the vitals on this guy.

1280
01:22:33,188 --> 01:22:34,439
Initiate all clear.

1281
01:22:34,523 --> 01:22:35,607
- Clear.
- Clear.

1282
01:22:35,691 --> 01:22:37,359
Floor's secure, sir.

1283
01:22:37,442 --> 01:22:38,777
Okay, come in.

1284
01:22:40,028 --> 01:22:42,030
Hold him there till we get somebody up.

1285
01:22:44,408 --> 01:22:45,868
Where is Carruthers and Messner?

1286
01:22:45,951 --> 01:22:48,245
Carruthers is dead.
Messner's unaccounted for.

1287
01:22:48,328 --> 01:22:49,371
Account for him!

1288
01:22:53,375 --> 01:22:56,587
- What's your name, baby girl?
- Georgia.

1289
01:22:58,046 --> 01:22:59,339
Georgia.

1290
01:23:00,466 --> 01:23:02,843
You know you saved this black man.

1291
01:23:03,886 --> 01:23:05,470
Now all you got to be is grateful.

1292
01:23:08,181 --> 01:23:10,183
You hurting pretty bad, huh?

1293
01:23:11,225 --> 01:23:12,310
I got shot twice.

1294
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:17,815
I think I accidentally shot and killed
my boy today.

1295
01:23:20,193 --> 01:23:25,072
If it gives you any comfort, you know,
I was going in there to act a fool, baby.

1296
01:23:26,616 --> 01:23:29,702
Straight-rocking heat, slaying niggas, man.

1297
01:23:30,203 --> 01:23:31,704
For real?

1298
01:23:33,414 --> 01:23:37,668
Your boy very well
might have been one of them.

1299
01:23:40,004 --> 01:23:42,882
I probably would've busted on you, too.

1300
01:23:43,049 --> 01:23:45,218
What a shame that would have been.

1301
01:23:49,514 --> 01:23:51,682
What was you doing here, anyway?

1302
01:23:53,309 --> 01:23:57,271
We was after some fool named Israel.

1303
01:23:59,148 --> 01:24:02,985
Damn, girl,
you're gonna make a nigga fall hard.

1304
01:24:03,569 --> 01:24:07,406
Put her down. Put her down
and get up against the wall right now.

1305
01:24:09,575 --> 01:24:12,620
Show me your hands.
Show me your fucking hands!

1306
01:24:12,954 --> 01:24:15,790
Drop the gun down or I'll fucking drain you.
Put the gun down!

1307
01:24:15,873 --> 01:24:19,168
I didn't do your man downstairs.
I found him like that.

1308
01:24:19,919 --> 01:24:21,045
Whether you believe me or not,

1309
01:24:21,129 --> 01:24:23,589
you know, that ain't even the least bit
important right now.

1310
01:24:23,673 --> 01:24:26,300
We're going to work this out and live,

1311
01:24:26,843 --> 01:24:29,554
or we gonna keep doing the same shit
we've been doing.

1312
01:24:29,636 --> 01:24:33,181
I ain't got no problem with you
or your Bureau,

1313
01:24:34,099 --> 01:24:38,395
so I think you're better off just moving on
and letting us be.

1314
01:25:22,147 --> 01:25:24,149
Agent Messner is on his way in.

1315
01:25:45,754 --> 01:25:47,464
- Agent Messner.
- What's going on?

1316
01:25:47,547 --> 01:25:50,175
Are you all right, son?
You need some medical attention?

1317
01:25:50,258 --> 01:25:52,177
No, I don't need medical attention.
Tell me what's going on.

1318
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:55,679
- Okay, come on, sit down.
- Please, no, I don't want to sit. Explain it.

1319
01:25:55,763 --> 01:25:57,973
It's very difficult to explain everything
right now.

1320
01:25:58,057 --> 01:25:59,517
Much larger matters loom.

1321
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,685
I'm sorry to hear about Carruthers.

1322
01:26:01,769 --> 01:26:04,355
- He's a good man.
- Director Locke?

1323
01:26:06,857 --> 01:26:10,110
He's had a sustained arrhythmic episode,
severe cardiac distress.

1324
01:26:10,194 --> 01:26:11,821
I can't help him here.
We have to take him to...

1325
01:26:11,904 --> 01:26:13,072
Okay, gentlemen,
let's get him up on the roof.

1326
01:26:13,155 --> 01:26:15,825
Get Mr Israel up on the roof.
He's travelling back with us.

1327
01:26:15,908 --> 01:26:17,660
I can't explain everything right now.

1328
01:26:17,743 --> 01:26:18,994
No, I...

1329
01:26:19,453 --> 01:26:22,039
- I need you to go back to Washington.
- What the hell happened here?

1330
01:26:22,123 --> 01:26:24,458
I'm sorry,
I cannot disclose anything more right now.

1331
01:26:24,542 --> 01:26:25,584
So many people are dead.

1332
01:26:25,668 --> 01:26:26,794
I need you to return to Washington.

1333
01:26:26,877 --> 01:26:29,255
- You'll be debriefed in the days to come.
- Explain it now.

1334
01:26:29,338 --> 01:26:31,340
Go back to Washington.

1335
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:32,716
There he goes!

1336
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,595
No, don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me, please!

1337
01:26:36,679 --> 01:26:40,349
He went this way! Please, don't shoot me.
Don't shoot! Please! Don't shoot.

1338
01:26:54,113 --> 01:26:57,616
FBI. You gotta get up there! Got to go!

1339
01:27:10,171 --> 01:27:11,839
Get these hotel guests out
in the hallway there.

1340
01:27:11,922 --> 01:27:13,424
Just clear them down the hall.

1341
01:27:17,595 --> 01:27:19,846
Make room. Make room, please.

1342
01:27:27,979 --> 01:27:30,773
We'll have to go all the way around
to the other side.

1343
01:27:31,774 --> 01:27:34,277
Clear the way here. Clear the way.

1344
01:28:28,456 --> 01:28:29,582
Hey.

1345
01:28:33,336 --> 01:28:36,047
- That your car?
- No, I...

1346
01:28:38,758 --> 01:28:40,426
I'm confiscating it.

1347
01:28:41,511 --> 01:28:42,636
FBI.

1348
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:45,139
- Oh, you're FBI.
- Yeah.

1349
01:28:45,639 --> 01:28:48,809
Yes, I am. I would advise you
to lower your weapon, sir.

1350
01:28:49,309 --> 01:28:52,146
You're investigating those murders
out at the lake, huh?

1351
01:28:52,312 --> 01:28:55,649
- Say what?
- Three men were ambushed and shot.

1352
01:28:55,732 --> 01:28:58,861
Two died
and had their bodies dumped in the lake.

1353
01:28:59,695 --> 01:29:02,531
The other has severe hypothermia,

1354
01:29:03,323 --> 01:29:07,453
possible dementia, and will probably be
a multiple amputee by week's end.

1355
01:29:07,536 --> 01:29:09,496
Shit, okay. You're right.

1356
01:29:11,248 --> 01:29:12,583
I'm sorry.

1357
01:29:14,835 --> 01:29:18,046
You shot me.
And you murdered my friends.

1358
01:29:18,547 --> 01:29:20,549
Yeah, I know.

1359
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:24,970
- And you dumped us in the lake.
- Pretty much.

1360
01:29:25,179 --> 01:29:27,598
You were here hunting
the man named Israel, weren't you?

1361
01:29:27,848 --> 01:29:31,226
Is that who you was here for? Israel?

1362
01:29:32,853 --> 01:29:35,522
I guess we both got beat out then,
didn't we?

1363
01:29:36,106 --> 01:29:37,441
Yeah, goddamn.

1364
01:29:37,774 --> 01:29:41,779
Crazy motherfuckers up there, huh?
Gee whiz.

1365
01:29:44,114 --> 01:29:46,241
Just give us your keys
and get the fuck out of here.

1366
01:29:46,325 --> 01:29:47,409
Okay.

1367
01:29:58,045 --> 01:30:00,714
I'm really sorry about all that.

1368
01:30:02,216 --> 01:30:04,635
Shit gets wild and crazy.

1369
01:30:05,219 --> 01:30:09,096
Fate just up and fucks you
for no good reason.

1370
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:11,015
You know?

1371
01:30:11,891 --> 01:30:13,851
It's the way of the world!

1372
01:30:14,227 --> 01:30:16,187
The way it's always gonna be.

1373
01:30:18,523 --> 01:30:20,024
Okay, now.

1374
01:30:21,067 --> 01:30:22,401
Peace, bro.

1375
01:30:34,372 --> 01:30:35,873
Oh, fuck this.

1376
01:31:45,108 --> 01:31:48,445
Suicide of some sort.
You know, troubles with the law. Drugs.

1377
01:31:48,528 --> 01:31:49,654
Deal with the patients.

1378
01:31:49,738 --> 01:31:52,657
All right, Doctor, thank you.
You know, just make it sound good.

1379
01:31:52,741 --> 01:31:53,825
Okay.

1380
01:31:55,327 --> 01:31:56,995
Where's Israel?

1381
01:31:59,456 --> 01:32:01,500
- What are you doing here?
- My debriefing.

1382
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:04,669
Your debriefing? Your debriefing
will be handled in DC, like I told you.

1383
01:32:04,753 --> 01:32:06,630
No, we need to handle it now.

1384
01:32:14,554 --> 01:32:16,556
You are instructed to get out...

1385
01:32:18,225 --> 01:32:19,976
What are you doing, Agent Messner?

1386
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:21,895
Walk. Let's go.

1387
01:32:23,355 --> 01:32:25,941
You're going to tell me
why no call was made

1388
01:32:26,024 --> 01:32:28,693
to inform us that the Israel situation
had been altered.

1389
01:32:28,777 --> 01:32:30,904
Why I and my friend and partner,

1390
01:32:30,987 --> 01:32:33,115
whose body
is going into a furnace tomorrow,

1391
01:32:33,198 --> 01:32:34,324
were never fucking contacted.

1392
01:32:34,407 --> 01:32:37,202
- I cannot discuss it.
- You can and you will.

1393
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:40,872
You are finished.

1394
01:32:40,956 --> 01:32:43,458
Look at my fucking face.
You just figure that out?

1395
01:32:46,670 --> 01:32:49,965
Get that gun out of my spine
or engage the safety, please.

1396
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:51,675
Thank you.

1397
01:33:03,686 --> 01:33:05,229
Make it make sense.

1398
01:33:07,231 --> 01:33:09,233
They are father and son.

1399
01:33:11,861 --> 01:33:13,279
Israel's mother was 19

1400
01:33:13,362 --> 01:33:15,906
at the time when she and Sparazza
had a brief affair

1401
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:18,117
of which Israel was the byproduct.

1402
01:33:18,367 --> 01:33:21,036
That same year,
she brought a paternity suit against him.

1403
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,997
Paternity suit? Just for fun?

1404
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:25,082
Our surveillance of Padiche, Serna...

1405
01:33:25,166 --> 01:33:29,044
All bogus and bad information
that set off a series of unfortunate events.

1406
01:33:29,128 --> 01:33:30,671
- He's gonna clip Israel.
- Buddy Israel.

1407
01:33:30,754 --> 01:33:32,006
Buddy Israel.

1408
01:33:32,089 --> 01:33:33,174
Buddy Israel.

1409
01:33:33,257 --> 01:33:35,634
- They got a guy. Some Swede.
- Swede?

1410
01:33:35,718 --> 01:33:38,387
- Any word on this Swede?
...the mention of this mysterious Swede.

1411
01:33:38,471 --> 01:33:41,015
There's no Swedish hit man
on anyone's radar.

1412
01:33:41,098 --> 01:33:44,226
Dr Ingstrom, the Swede,
is not a hired killer.

1413
01:33:44,310 --> 01:33:45,644
Supposedly a specialist.

1414
01:33:45,728 --> 01:33:48,481
He's had a sustained arrhythmic episode,
severe cardiac distress.

1415
01:33:48,564 --> 01:33:51,358
He's actually the head of cardiology
at Stockholm University.

1416
01:33:51,442 --> 01:33:52,902
Primo wants Israel's heart.

1417
01:33:52,985 --> 01:33:54,862
- Heart?
- Mention of Israel's heart?

1418
01:33:54,945 --> 01:33:57,406
He's one of the best heart surgeons
in the world.

1419
01:33:57,490 --> 01:33:59,909
The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot,

1420
01:34:01,410 --> 01:34:03,537
the man who escaped
the penthouse yesterday...

1421
01:34:03,746 --> 01:34:05,080
Don't shoot me!

1422
01:34:05,414 --> 01:34:06,499
...in disguise.

1423
01:34:06,582 --> 01:34:10,211
He was hired by Sparazza
to neutralise Israel's entourage.

1424
01:34:12,129 --> 01:34:15,132
Dr Ingstrom was here
to perform the surgery.

1425
01:34:15,216 --> 01:34:19,220
And as father and son,
they are blood compatible.

1426
01:34:27,936 --> 01:34:30,980
You're talking about a transplant,
aren't you?

1427
01:34:31,564 --> 01:34:33,399
You're talking about
a fucking heart transplant.

1428
01:34:33,483 --> 01:34:36,444
You're gonna kill Israel to save Sparazza.

1429
01:34:39,739 --> 01:34:40,907
No.

1430
01:34:43,409 --> 01:34:45,954
Well, they dug it up in archives
as part of the Sparazza investigation.

1431
01:34:46,037 --> 01:34:48,790
That Sparazza
had major elective plastic surgery?

1432
01:34:48,873 --> 01:34:50,875
It wasn't elective.
It was undertaken to save his life.

1433
01:34:50,959 --> 01:34:52,085
Look at the work he's had done.

1434
01:34:52,168 --> 01:34:54,921
It wasn't cosmetic. It was reconstructive.

1435
01:34:55,213 --> 01:34:57,423
Look at the date of the first procedure.

1436
01:34:57,507 --> 01:34:59,509
Fifteen separate procedures since 1952.

1437
01:34:59,592 --> 01:35:03,179
Same year that Sparazza
supposedly murdered Freeman Heller.

1438
01:35:03,263 --> 01:35:07,183
I'd like to show you exactly what I meant
when I said, "Change my face."

1439
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:10,728
Using the latest techniques
in cosmetic surgery,

1440
01:35:10,812 --> 01:35:12,730
I will have my ears pinned back.

1441
01:35:12,814 --> 01:35:16,734
Removing a slight piece of bone in my chin
I will alter my jaw line.

1442
01:35:17,402 --> 01:35:21,114
A procedure known as rhinoplasty
will reduce the size of my nose.

1443
01:35:21,364 --> 01:35:23,491
If you add facial hair
to the equation, gentlemen,

1444
01:35:23,575 --> 01:35:26,119
you have a face
that looks nothing like mine,

1445
01:35:26,494 --> 01:35:29,289
and more importantly,
nothing like a federal agent's.

1446
01:35:29,372 --> 01:35:31,291
- Oh, Christ.
- I will maintain a slight limp.

1447
01:35:31,416 --> 01:35:33,835
My accent will be a regional Calabrese.

1448
01:35:34,085 --> 01:35:36,337
My birthplace, Cosenza, Italy.

1449
01:35:36,421 --> 01:35:37,547
That's him.

1450
01:35:37,672 --> 01:35:38,798
And my name...

1451
01:35:38,882 --> 01:35:41,342
- That's Heller.
...will be Primo Sparazza.

1452
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:45,512
Now, gentlemen, I understand
that this is a dramatic approach.

1453
01:35:45,596 --> 01:35:48,599
He went deep cover in 1940.
He could have ripped the Mafia apart.

1454
01:35:48,682 --> 01:35:49,725
But I firmly believe...

1455
01:35:49,808 --> 01:35:52,102
Dismantled most of the organised crime
in this country.

1456
01:35:52,186 --> 01:35:55,647
...this is the only way
to truly infiltrate organised crime.

1457
01:35:55,731 --> 01:35:59,151
His superiors were convinced
that he had gone rogue,

1458
01:35:59,234 --> 01:36:00,527
swapped allegiances,

1459
01:36:00,611 --> 01:36:02,738
so they gave the order
to terminate his cover.

1460
01:36:02,821 --> 01:36:06,492
All this time, we were told
that it was Sparazza that killed Heller,

1461
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:09,703
when it was us, the FBI.

1462
01:36:12,873 --> 01:36:14,541
And we didn't kill him.

1463
01:36:16,293 --> 01:36:19,546
He survived. But the injuries he sustained

1464
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:23,050
required constant surgery,
forever altering his features.

1465
01:36:23,133 --> 01:36:27,888
So he assumed the identity of his alter ego.

1466
01:36:28,889 --> 01:36:31,934
The figment of Primo Sparazza
became flesh and blood,

1467
01:36:32,017 --> 01:36:34,895
and Freeman Heller was no more.

1468
01:36:37,648 --> 01:36:41,360
Now, the brass wanted Heller's op
removed from official records,

1469
01:36:41,443 --> 01:36:43,987
so they buried it completely
and they wrote Heller off.

1470
01:36:44,238 --> 01:36:46,865
All the agents from that era,
they're dead and gone,

1471
01:36:46,949 --> 01:36:49,159
so history defaulted to fable.

1472
01:36:49,243 --> 01:36:52,746
Until now. Heller's op predated
the second World War.

1473
01:36:52,830 --> 01:36:54,706
About 60 years of amassed intel.

1474
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:57,376
Do you have any idea
of how valuable that is?

1475
01:36:57,459 --> 01:36:58,544
Yeah.

1476
01:37:00,504 --> 01:37:01,880
So you made another deal, didn't you?

1477
01:37:01,964 --> 01:37:04,049
Israel's deal with the government
was tossed out.

1478
01:37:04,133 --> 01:37:08,053
We are now trying to rehabilitate him,
so we can attempt a transplant.

1479
01:37:08,137 --> 01:37:10,721
You realise that you're doing this
to save Sparazza?

1480
01:37:10,805 --> 01:37:13,558
No, son. I'm doing all this to save Heller.

1481
01:37:13,641 --> 01:37:15,852
So you send us in there, bugles blaring,

1482
01:37:15,935 --> 01:37:18,646
and when it bottoms out,
we're the last to know!

1483
01:37:19,230 --> 01:37:20,898
We need cohesion
to move forward son, not...

1484
01:37:20,982 --> 01:37:25,445
Oh, shitcan the cue-card rhetoric
and talk to me like a man.

1485
01:37:25,528 --> 01:37:30,408
You withheld information while
Carruthers lay dying in vain and in the dark.

1486
01:37:30,491 --> 01:37:33,995
And your reasons for doing that
are exactly what?

1487
01:37:36,164 --> 01:37:37,331
That?

1488
01:37:39,125 --> 01:37:41,085
Some mob fossil?

1489
01:37:41,878 --> 01:37:44,213
A monster that the Bureau built?

1490
01:37:44,297 --> 01:37:47,341
You tell me something,
is he the Rosetta Stone

1491
01:37:47,425 --> 01:37:49,760
that's going to blow the lid off
the last 60 years?

1492
01:37:49,844 --> 01:37:50,887
Possibly.

1493
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:53,222
Is he gonna show you
where all the bodies are buried?

1494
01:37:53,389 --> 01:37:58,186
Or is his ultimate worth bullshit?

1495
01:37:58,269 --> 01:38:00,271
Utterly useless?

1496
01:38:00,354 --> 01:38:03,441
- That's a risk we take.
- Yeah, empty pockets.

1497
01:38:03,524 --> 01:38:07,028
Empty pockets paid for
by the lives of our own people.

1498
01:38:07,111 --> 01:38:08,362
You're blowing this way out of proportion.

1499
01:38:08,446 --> 01:38:09,906
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1500
01:38:09,989 --> 01:38:12,033
- My guy is dead.
- You're starting to piss me off.

1501
01:38:12,116 --> 01:38:13,993
The Bureau betrayed us.

1502
01:38:14,076 --> 01:38:15,620
- Wake up.
- You betrayed us...

1503
01:38:15,703 --> 01:38:16,954
- Stop pointing...
...Deputy Director Locke.

1504
01:38:17,038 --> 01:38:18,122
Get that thing out of my face.

1505
01:38:18,206 --> 01:38:19,999
You betrayed us
the way you betrayed them.

1506
01:38:20,124 --> 01:38:21,209
You fucking asshole!

1507
01:38:24,796 --> 01:38:28,090
Okay, if you like, I'll take
your verbal resignation right here,

1508
01:38:28,174 --> 01:38:29,258
right now.

1509
01:38:29,342 --> 01:38:32,803
Do you want your career to end here, now,
like this?

1510
01:38:33,470 --> 01:38:34,638
Your call.

1511
01:38:34,721 --> 01:38:37,766
Now, I'm prepared to dismiss your behaviour.
And in light of what's happened,

1512
01:38:37,849 --> 01:38:38,892
I understand it.

1513
01:38:38,975 --> 01:38:40,185
I really do, and I'm truly sorry.

1514
01:38:40,268 --> 01:38:41,812
But a decision has been made.

1515
01:38:41,895 --> 01:38:45,232
And we're required to abide by it,
regardless of our personal feelings.

1516
01:38:45,315 --> 01:38:48,151
Feelings that might run contrary
to the collective good.

1517
01:38:48,235 --> 01:38:50,570
And that, I need you to understand.

1518
01:38:50,654 --> 01:38:53,490
It's time for you to get on a jet back to DC

1519
01:38:53,573 --> 01:38:56,201
and make no further inquiry into this matter.

1520
01:38:56,284 --> 01:38:58,537
Is that understood, Agent Messner?
