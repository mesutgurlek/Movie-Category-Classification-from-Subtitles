00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,794
Mr Dufresne,

19
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:12,089
describe the confrontation you had
with your wife the night she was murdered.

20
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,888
It was very bitter.

21
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:23,351
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around...

22
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:28,356
And she said she wanted a divorce in Reno.

23
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,274
What was your response?

24
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,318
I told her I would not grant one.

25
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,446
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

26
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:39,158
Those were the words you used, Mr Dufresne,
according to your neighbours.

27
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,996
If they say so.
I really don't remember. I was upset.

28
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,626
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

29
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,586
She packed a bag.

30
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,882
She packed a bag to go and stay with...
Mr Quentin.

31
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,260
DA: Glenn Quentin.

32
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,428
Golf pro at the Snowdon Hills Country Club.

33
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,349
The man you discovered was your wife's lover.

34
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,477
Did you follow her?

35
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,939
I went to a few bars first.

36
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,900
Later, I drove to his house to confront them.

37
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:16,571
They weren't home, so I...parked in the turnout,

38
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,239
and waited.

39
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,533
DA: With what intention?

40
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,410
DUFRESNE: I'm not sure.

41
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,704
I was confused.

42
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,414
Drunk.

43
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,210
I think...mostly, I wanted to scare them.

44
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,547
When they arrived,
you went up to the house and murdered them.

45
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,717
No. I was sobering up.

46
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,553
I got back in the car,
and I drove home to sleep it off.

47
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,098
Along the way, I stopped,
and I threw my gun into the Royal River.

48
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,392
I feel I've been very clear on this point.

49
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:50,271
Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning
woman shows up the following morning

50
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:55,985
and finds your wife in bed with her lover,
riddled with .38 calibre bullets.

51
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,324
Now, does that strike you as a fantastic
coincidence, Mr Dufresne, or is it just me?

52
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,242
(Whispers) Yes, it does.

53
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:09,415
Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun
into the river before the murders took place?

54
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:13,294
- That's very convenient.
- It's the truth.

55
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,090
DA: The police dragged that river
for three days, and nary a gun was found.

56
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,968
So, there could be no comparison made
between your gun

57
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:25,181
and the bullets taken from
the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

58
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,393
And that also...

59
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,479
is very convenient.

60
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,022
Isn't it, Mr Dufresne?

61
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,525
Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,

62
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,154
I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

We have the accused at the scene of the crime.

We have footprints, tyre tracks,

70
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:10,518

00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,985
lying dead in each other's arms.

75
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,322
They had sinned.

Now, while you think about that...

..think about this.

79
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,088
A revolver holds six bullets.

80
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,548
Not eight.

81
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:44,093
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded
crime of passion.

82
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,221
That could be understood, if not condoned.

83
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,932
No. This was revenge...

84
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:54,520
of a much more brutal
and cold-blooded nature. Consider this.

85
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,148
Four bullets per victim.

86
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,608
Not six shots fired, but eight.

87
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,612
That means that he fired the gun empty,

88
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,948
and then stopped to reload...

89
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,660
..so that he could shoot each of them again.

90
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,329
An extra bullet per lover.

91
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,457
Right in the head.

It chills my blood just to look at you.

By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine,

96
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:34,060
I hereby order you to serve two life sentences,
back to back.

97
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,813
One for each of your victims. So be it.

Sit.

100
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,472
We see by your file
you've served 20 years of a life sentence.

101
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,140
Yes, sir.

102
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,684
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

103
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,937
Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

104
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,524
I mean, I learned my lesson.

105
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:25,861
I can honestly say...I'm a changed man.

106

I'm no longer a danger to society.

107

That's God's honest truth.

Hey, Red. How'd it go?

109
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,786
Same old shit. Different day.

110
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,456
Yeah. I know how you feel.
I'm up for rejection next week.

111
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,252
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

112
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,628
It happens.

113
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,297
Hey, Red. Bump me a deck.

114
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,758
Get the fuck out of my face, will you, man?
You've had five packs already.

115
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,010
- Four.
- Five.

116
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,639
RED: There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

117
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,641
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

118
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,853
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer- if that's your thing -

119
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,523
a bottle of brandy
to celebrate your kid's high-school graduation.

120
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,942
Damn near anything, within reason.

121
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,320
Yes, sir. I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

So, when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949

124
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,456
and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth
into the prison for him,

125
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,583
I told him, "No problem."

126
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,002
Andy came to Shawshank Prison

127
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:51,215
in early 1947, for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

128
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,594
On the outside he had been vice-president
of a large Portland bank.

129
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,680
Good work for a man as young as he was.

130
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,807
(Applause and whistling)

131
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,687
Hey, Red.

132
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,482
(Whistling)

133
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,693

Do you speak English, butt steak?
You follow this officer.

136

(Men shouting)

137
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,785
I haven't seen such a sorry-looking heap
of m-m-maggot shit in all my life.

138
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,912
MAN: Hey, fish! Come over here.

139
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,847

- Come on, fish.

140
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,271
Taking bets today, Red?

141
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,357
Smokes or coins? Better's choice.

142
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,233
Smokes. Put me down for two.

143
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,361
All right. Who's your horse?

144
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,739
That little sack of shit...eighth from the front.

145
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,990
He'll be first.

146
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,284
- Bullshit. I'll take that action.
- Me too.

147
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,620
You're out some smokes, son. Let me tell you.

148
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,622
Heywood, you're so smart, you call it.

149
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,208

150
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,669
The fifth one from the front.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

151
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,631
(Men shouting)
- Fresh fish!

152
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,802
Fresh fish today! We're reeling them in!

153
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:04,139
RED: I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy,
first time I laid eyes on him.

154
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,726
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.

155
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,104
That was my first impression of the man.

156
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,897
MAN: What do you say, Red?

157
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,234
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

158
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,486
That guy? Never happen.

159
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,695
Ten cigarettes.

160
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,947
That's a rich bet.

161
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,241
All right. Who's gonna prove me wrong?

162
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,410
Heywood? Jigger?

163
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,953
Skeet?

164
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,247
Floyd?

165
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,457
Four brave souls.

166
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,377
TANNOY:
Return to your cell blocks for evening count.

167
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,921
All prisoners return to your cell blocks.

168
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,111
Turn to the right. Eyes front.

169
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,586
This is Mr Hadley. He's Captain of the Guards.

170
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,838
I'm Mr Norton, the Warden.

171
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,424
You are convicted felons.

172
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,843
That's why they've sent you to me.

173
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,553
Rule number one:

174
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,513
No blasphemy.

175
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:30,142
I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain
in my prison.

176
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,602
The other rules...

177
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,395
you'll figure out as you go along.

178
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,272
Any questions?

179
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,523
When do we eat?

180
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,242
HADLEY: You eat when we say you eat!

181
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,704
You shit when we say you shit,
and you piss when we say you piss.

182
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,665
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

183
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,042
Aarghh!

184
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,085
On your feet.

185
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,962
NORTON: I believe in two things.

186
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,924
Discipline and the Bible.

187
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,842
Here you'll receive both.

188
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,596
Put your trust in the Lord.

189
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,515
Your ass belongs to me.

190
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,685
Welcome to Shawshank.

191
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,234
Unhook 'em.

192
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,366
Turn around.

193
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,166
That's enough.

194
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,002
Move to the end of the cage.

195
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,462
Turn around.

196
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,755
Delouse him.

197
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,841
Turn around.

198
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,639
Move out of the cage, go left.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

199
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,224
Next man up.

200
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,563
To the right. Right, right, right.

201
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,189
Left, left...

202
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:03,443
RED: The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

203
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,655
They march you in,
naked as the day you were born,

204
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,826
skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit they throw on you.

205
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,870
And when they put you in that cell,

206
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,623
and those bars slam home...

207
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,459
that's when you know it's for real.

208
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,879
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

209
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,172
Nothing left,

210
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,925
but all the time in the world to think about it.

211
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:31,972
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

212
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,350
Somebody always breaks down crying.

213
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,894
Happens every time.

214
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,063
The only question is:

215
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,523
Who's it gonna be?

216
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,193
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.

217
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,197
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

218
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,500
Lights out!

219
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,211
(Click of light switches)

220
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:24,107
RED: I remember my first night.

221
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,234
Seems like a long time ago.

222
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,280
MAN: Yoo-hoo!

223
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,866
Hey, fish.

224
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,994
Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy.

225
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,998
- Boy, are you scared of the dark?
- You like it here, new fish?

226
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,417
You'll wish
your daddy never dicked your mommy.

227
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,505
Fishy! Oh, I want me a pork chop. Oh, yes!

228
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:51,635
You taking this down, new fish?
There's gonna be a quiz later!

229
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,097
- Poke your ass out, give me a first look!
- Shh! Keep it down.

230
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,517
RED: The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

231
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,644
They don't quit till they reel someone in.

232
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,230
(Men whispering in background)

233
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,816
Hey, Fat Ass.

234
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,526
Fat Ass.

235
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,238
Talk to me, boy.

236
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,032
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.

237
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:17,035
Don't you listen to these nitwits.
You hear me?

238
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,204
This place ain't so bad.

239
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,914
I tell you what.

240
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,252
I'll introduce you around.
Make you feel right at home.

241
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,921
I know a couple of big old bull queers

242
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,966
that would just love to make your acquaintance.

243
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,469
Especially that big, white,
m-mushy butt of yours.

244
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,471
God!

245
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,056
I don't belong here!

246
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,558
MAN: We have a winner!

247
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,393
FAT ASS: I wanna go home!

248
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,311
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

249
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,565
Hey, it's the fat guy! It's the fat guy!

250
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:50,485
Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

251
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,280
FAT ASS: I don't belong here!

252
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,573
ALL: Fresh fish!

253
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,993
I wanna go home. I want my mommy.

254
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,079
MAN: I had your mother. She wasn't that great.

255
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,664
(Men chanting) Fresh fish!

256
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,416
(Door opens)

257
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,294
What the Christ is this happy horse shit?

258
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,088
He took the Lord's name in vain.
I'm telling the Warden.

259
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,673
With my baton up your ass!

260
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,425
FAT ASS: Let me out of here!

261
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,887
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

262
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,138
FAT ASS: Please...

263
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,265
I ain't supposed to be here.

264
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,725
Not me!

265
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,269
I ain't gonna count to three, or even one.

266
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,646
Shut the fuck up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

267
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,565
(Whispers) Shut up, man. Shut up.

268
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,941
There's been a mistake!

269
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:33,195
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here!

270
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,362
Open that cell.

271
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:38,575
MAN: Me neither.
You people run this place like a fucking prison!

272
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,126
HADLEY: Son of a bitch.

273
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,086
(Thuds)

274
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,214
(Whimpering)

275
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,341
PRISONER: Take it easy.

276
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,348
(Yelps)

277
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,534
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here
the rest of the night,

278
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:24,287
I swear by God and sonny Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

279
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,414
Every last motherfucker in here.

280
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:34,005
Call the trustees.
Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.

281
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:53,066
RED: His first night in the joint,
Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

282
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,986
He never made a sound.

283
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,949
(Gate buzzer)

284
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,796
GUARD: Tier 3 North. Clear.

285
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,048
Tier 2 South. Clear.

286
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,009
Tier 3 South. Clear.

287
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,052
Tier 1 North...

288
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,930
- Tier 1 South. Clear.
- Tier 4 South. Clear.

289
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,057
Prepare to roll out.

290
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,521
GUARD: Roll out!

291
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,243
Are... Are you going to eat that?

292
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,205
I hadn't... I hadn't planned on it.

293
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,499
Do you mind?

294
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,467
Ah...that's nice and ripe.

295
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,307
(Chirps)

296
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:56,564
Jake says thank you.

297
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,025
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

298
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,865
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

299
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,701
Oh, no, no. Here he comes.

300
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,791
Morning, fellas. Fine morning, ain't it?

301
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,293
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

302
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,796
Come on. Set 'em down.
I want 'em all lined up here,

303
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,674
just like a pretty little chorus line.

304
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,843
Yeah, look at that!

305
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,804
- Look at that. Oh, Lord!
- I can't stand this guy.

306
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,930
(Inhales)

307
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,683
Yes. Richmond, Virginia.

308
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,852
- Smell my ass!
- After he smells mine.

309
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:39,274
Gee, Red, it was a terrible shame
about your horse coming in last, an' all.

310
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,569
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine,
though.

311
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,363
I owe that boy a great big, sloppy kiss
when I see him.

312
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,450
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes,
instead?

313
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,326
Lucky fuck.

314
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,120
Hey, Tyrell.

315
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,165
You pull infirmary duty this week?

316
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,958
How's that horse of mine doing?

317
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,501
Dead.

318
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:03,923
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.
The doc had already gone home for the night.

319
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,718
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

320
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,596
By then, hell, there weren't nothing we could do.

321
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,978
What was his name?

322
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,608
What did you say?

323
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,904
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

324
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,656
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

325
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,495
It doesn't fuckin' matter what his name was.
He's dead.

326
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,225
Hey...

327
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,019
Anybody come at you yet?

328
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,523
Anybody get to you yet?

329
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,735
Hey, we all need friends in here.

330
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,695
I could be a friend to you.

331
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,825
Hey...

332
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,540
Hard to get.

333
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,876
I like that.

334
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,845
RED: Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

335
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,389
I guess he had a lot on his mind,

336
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,641
trying to adapt to life on the inside.

337
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,937
It wasn't until a month went by
that he opened his mouth

338
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,273
to say more than two words to somebody.

339
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,277
As it turned out...

340
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,237
that somebody was me.

341
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:56,995
TANNOY: Officers Russell and Burwell
report to the duty officer.

342
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,832
I'm Andy Dufresne.

343
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,959
The wife-killing banker.

344
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,546
Why did you do it?

345
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,256
I didn't, since you ask.

346
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,384
(Laughs) You're gonna fit right in!

347
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,637
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

348
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:18,016
- Heywood, what are you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

349
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,771
Rumour has it you're a real cold fish.

350
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,609
You think your shit smells sweeter than most.
Is that right?

351
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,028
- What do you think?
- To tell you the truth,

352
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,198
I haven't made up my mind. (Chuckles)

353
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:37,368
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

354
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,955
I'm known to locate certain things,
from time to time.

355
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,042
- I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.
- A what?

356
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,501
A rock hammer.

357
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,837
- What is it, and why?
- What do you care?

358
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,634
Well, if it was a toothbrush, I'd just quote a price,

359
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:55,261
but then a toothbrush is a non-lethal object.

360
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,431
Fair enough.

361
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,975
A rock hammer
is about six or seven inches long.

362
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,685
Looks like a miniature pickaxe.

363
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,895
Pickaxe?

364
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,022
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

365
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,901
Quartz?

366
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,611
Quartz.

367
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,281
And some mica.

368
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:16,491
Shale.

369
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,202
Limestone.

370
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,204
So?

371
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,373
So, I'm a rock hound.

372
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,668
At least, I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

373
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,878
Or maybe you want
to hammer somebody's skull.

374
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:30,421
No, sir.

375
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,132
I have no enemies here.

376
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,551
No? Wait a while.

377
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,305
Word gets around.

378
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,517
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

379
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,352
Especially Bogs.

380
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:49,691
I don't suppose it would help any
if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.

381
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,276
RED: Neither are they.

382
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,028
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.

383
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:03,871
Bull queers take by force.
It's all they want or understand.

384
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:07,583
If I were you,
I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

385
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,002
Thanks for the advice.

386
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,670
Well, that's free.

387
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,006
You understand my concern.

388
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,633
Well, if there's any trouble,
I won't use the hammer.

389
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:19,887
Then I guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

390
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,182
Did I miss something? What's funny?

391
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:26,269
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

392
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,189
What's an item like this usually go for?

393
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,318
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

394
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:36,070
My normal mark-up's 20 per cent.

395
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,656
But this is a specialty item.

396
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:41,284
The risk goes up, the price goes up.

397
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,286
Let's make it an even ten bucks.

398
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,204
Ten it is.

399
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:48,750
Waste of money, if you ask me.

400
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,335
Why's that?

401
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:54,464
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.

402
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,384
If they find it, you're gonna lose it.

403
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,595
If they do catch you with it, you don't know me.

404
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,889
Mention my name, we never do business again.

405
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:06,059
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now, you got that?

406
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,020
I understand.

407
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,480
Thank you...

408
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,148
Mr er...?

409
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,650
Red. The name's Red.

410
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:15,735
Red?

411
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,529
Why do they call you that?

412
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,285
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

413
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,338
RED: I could see
why some of the boys took him for snobby.

414
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,841
He had a quiet way about him.

415
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:43,388
A walk and a talk
that just wasn't normal around here.

416
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,014
He strolled...

417
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:49,435
like a man in a park,
without a care or worry in the world.

418
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,232
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

419
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:58,444
Yeah. I think it would be fair to say...

420
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,571
I liked Andy from the start.

421
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,493
Let's go!
Some of us have got a schedule to keep.

422
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,873
Move it! Come on. Move it!

423
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,630
Bob, how are you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

424
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,850
Easy.

425
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,977
Keep it moving.

426
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,022
Red...

427
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:59,797
RED: Andy was right. I finally got the joke.

428
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:04,343
It would take a man about 600 years
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

429
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:09,849
Book?

430
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,767
Not today.

431
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,192
- Book?
- No.

432
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,195
Hey, Brooksy.

433
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,575
Delivery for Dufresne.

434
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:40,296
Book?

435
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,468
Dufresne...

436
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,678
Here's your book.

437
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,768
Thanks.

438
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,858
Dufresne! We're running low on Hexlite.

439
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,985
Get on back and fetch us up some.

440
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,191
If you get this in your eyes, it blinds you.

441
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,986
Honey...hush.

442
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,953
(Groans)

443
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,500
That's it. You fight.

444
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,168
It's better that way.

445
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,004
(Screaming and yelling)

446
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,430
RED: I wish I could tell you
that Andy fought the good fight,

447
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:15,057
and the Sisters let him be.

448
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,143
I wish I could tell you that.

449
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,270
But prison is no fairy-tale world.

450
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,399
He never said who did it.

451
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,527
But we all knew.

452
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,446
(Gate buzzer)

453
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,742
Things went on like that for a while.

454
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,453
Prison life consists of routine...

455
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,705
and then more routine.

456
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,919
Every so often,
Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

457
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,173
The Sisters kept at him.

458
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:51,385
Sometimes he was able to fight 'em off.
Sometimes not.

459
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,722
And that's how it went for Andy.

460
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,350
That was his routine.

461
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:01,228
I do believe
those first two years were the worst for him.

462
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,564
And I also believe,

463
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:08,194
if things had gone on that way,
this place would have got the best of him.

464
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,238
But then, in the spring of 1949,

465
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,324
the powers that be decided that...

466
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,827
The roof of the licence-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

467
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,622
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

468
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,958
As you know,

469
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:26,754
special detail carries with it special privileges.

470
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,881
RED: It was outdoor detail...

471
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:34,011
..and May is one damn fine month
to be working outdoors.

472
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:35,721
Stay in line there.

473
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:38,683
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

474
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,852
(Whispers)

475
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,356
Wallace E Unger.

476
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,026
Ellis Redding.

477
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:51,946
Wouldn't you know it?

478
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,615
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names.

479
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,784
GUARD: Andrew Dufresne.

480
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,413
RED: It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

481
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:03,207
I made my usual 20 per cent, of course.

482
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,877
HADLEY: So, this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

483
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,671
I say, "Yeah?"

484
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,466
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

485
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,052
Oh, damn, Byron. I'm sorry to hear that.

486
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:16,512
I'm not. He was an asshole.

487
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,931
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead, anyway.

488
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,977
So, anyway, this lawyer fella says to me,
"Your brother died a rich man."

489
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,771
Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

490
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,315
GUARD: A million bucks?

491
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,776
Fucking incredible
how lucky some assholes get.

492
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:33,404
Jeez-Louise! Are you gonna see any of that?

493
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,574
35,000. That's what he left me.

494
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,576
- Dollars?
- Yeah.

495
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,787
Holy shit! That's great.
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

496
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,080
Isn't it?

497
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:46,208
Dumb shit. What do you think
the government's gonna do to me?

498
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,794
Take a big, wet bite out of my ass, is what.

499
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,007
Poor Byron! Terrible fucking luck, huh?

500
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,760
RED: Crying shame.

501
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,511
Some people really got it awful!

502
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,138
Andy, are you nuts?

503
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,307
Keep your eyes on your mop, man. Andy!

504
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:04,393
GUARD: Well, you'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up...

505
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:07,313
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Maybe enough to buy a new car. Then what?

506
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,774
I've got to pay tax on the car.

507
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:13,736
Repair, maintenance, goddamn kids
pestering me to take them for a ride...

508
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,740
And at the end of the year, you figure the tax
wrong, you pay them out of your own pocket.

509
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,992
I tell you...Uncle Sam!

510
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,829
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

511
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:26,624
- Andy! Andy!
- What's he doing?

512
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,043
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

513
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,213
Some brother! Shit. (Spits)

514
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,297
Hey!

515
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,844
Mr Hadley...

516
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,304
do you trust your wife?

517
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,641
Oh, that's funny.

518
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:46,560
You're gonna look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

519
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:50,105
I mean, do you think
she'd go behind your back, try to hamstring you?

520
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:53,108
That's it. Step aside, Mert.

521
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:54,693
This fucker's having an accident.

522
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:55,945
He's gonna push him off.

523
00:35:56,029 --> 00:36:00,157
Cos if you do trust her,
there's no reason you can't keep that 35,000.

524
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,117
- What did you say?
- 35,000.

525
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,869
- 35,000?
- All of it.

526
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,247
- All of it?
- Every penny.

527
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,165
You'd better start making sense.

528
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,584
If you want to keep the money,
give it to your wife.

529
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:14,797
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

530
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,382
Bullshit! Tax-free?

531
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:19,593
Tax-free. The IRS can't touch one cent.

532
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,263
You're the smart banker what killed his wife.

533
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,891
Why should I believe a smart banker like you?
So I can end up in here with you?

534
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,476
It's legal. Ask the IRS.

535
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:30,771
They'll say the same thing.
But I feel stupid telling you this.

536
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:33,148
I'm sure you would have investigated the matter.

537
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:37,319
Yeah, I don't need no banker to tell me
where the bears shit in the buckwheat.

538
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:40,447
Of course not, but you do need someone
to set up the tax-free gift.

539
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,408
It'll cost you. A lawyer.

540
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,827
A bunch of ball-washing bastards.

541
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,706
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

542
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,125
If you get the forms, I'll prepare them for you.

543
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,043
Nearly free of charge.

544
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,548
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my co-workers.

545
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,050
GUARD:
Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, ain't it?

546
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:03,596
I think a man working outdoors
feels more like a man

547
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,431
if he can have a bottle of suds.

548
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,517
That's only my opinion...sir.

549
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,522
What are you jimmies staring at?

550
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:14,607
Back to work!

551
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,609
GUARD: Let's go. Work.

552
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:30,497
RED: And that's how it came to pass...
that on the second-to-last day of the job,

553
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:35,294
the convict crew that tarred the plate-factory roof
in the spring of '49...

554
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,589
wound up sitting in a row
at ten o'clock in the morning,

555
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,551
drinking icy-cold, Bohemia-style beer...

556
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:47,848
courtesy of the hardest screw that ever
walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

557
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,975
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

558
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:55,522
The colossal prick
even managed to sound magnanimous.

559
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:01,946
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders,
and felt like free men.

560
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,532
Hell, we could have been tarring the roof
of one of our own houses.

561
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,911
We were the lords of all creation.

562
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:13,540
As for Andy,
he spent that break hunkered in the shade...

563
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,335
a strange little smile on his face,

564
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,462
watching us drink his beer.

565
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,804
Hey...

566
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,180
Want a cold one, Andy?

567
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,932
No, thanks.

568
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,767
I gave up drinking.

569
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,816
RED: You could argue
he'd done it to curry favour with the guards.

570
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,694
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

571
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,408
Me, I think he did it just to feel normal again.

572
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,577
If only for a short while.

573
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,833
RED: King me.

574
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,335
Chess. Now, there's a game of kings.

575
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,963
- What?
- Civilised, strategic.

576
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,382
And a total fucking mystery.

577
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,675
I hate it.

578
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,677
Maybe you'll let me teach you someday.

579
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,221
(Chuckles) Yeah. Sure.

580
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,432
I thought of getting a board together.

581
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,309
Well, I'm the right man.
I'm the guy that can get things.

582
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,894
We might do business on a board.

583
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,772
But I want to carve the pieces myself.

584
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:22,443
One side in alabaster, the opposing side
in soapstone. What do you think?

585
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,445
I think it'll take years.

586
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,114
Well, years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

587
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,366
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

588
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:31,368
Pebbles, mostly.

589
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:38,625
Andy, we're getting to be kinda friends,
aren't we?

590
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,335
Yeah, I guess.

591
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,922
Can I ask you something?

592
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,008
Why did you do it?

593
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:51,055
I'm innocent, Red. Just like everybody else here.

594
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,436
What are you in for?

595
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:00,481
Murder.

596
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,982
Same as you.

597
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,192
Innocent?

598
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,946
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

599
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,049
Where's the canary?

600
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,425
How did you know?

601
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,635
How did I know what?

602
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,096
So, you don't know? Come.

603
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,017
This is where the canary is, Johnny.

604
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:21,311
(Woman singing)

605
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:25,357
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing
in my house, eh, Johnny?

606
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,696
That's quite a...

607
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,406
surprise.

608
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,660
Red...

609
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,537
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

610
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,455
Here she comes.

611
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,417
This is the part I like -
when she does that shit with her hair.

612
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,420
Yeah, I know. I've seen it three times this month.

613
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,505
Gilda, are you decent?

614
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,632
Me?

615
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,259
(Men howl)

616
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,386
Hah! God, I love it!

617
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,513
(Men cheer and whistle)

618
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:04,062
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

619
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:08,025
Yeah, I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

620
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,611
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

621
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,487
Can you get her?

622
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:17,075
So, this is Johnny Farrell.
I've heard a lot about you, Johnny.

623
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,036
Take a few weeks.

624
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,245
Weeks?

625
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:25,584
Well, yeah, Andy. I don't have her stuffed down
the front of my pants right now, I'm sorry to say.

626
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,128
But I'll get her. Relax.

627
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:31,924
Thanks.

628
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,009
- It was a surprise, Mr Farrell.
- It was.

629
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,135
MEN: Sit down.

630
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,137
Did you tell him what I'm doing here?

631
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:40,057
No, I wanted to save that as a surprise, too.

632
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:41,767
Hang on to your hat, Mr Farrell...

633
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,022
(Grunts)

634
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,154
- Take a walk.
- I gotta change the reel.

635
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,281
I said fuck off!

636
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:01,078
(Door closes as film dialogue continues)

637
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,914
Ain't you gonna scream?

638
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,084
Let's get this over with.

639
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:12,839
He broke my fuckin' nose!

640
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:27,437
Now...I'm gonna open my fly...

641
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:30,440
and you're gonna swallow
what I give you to swallow.

642
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,360
Then you're gonna swallow Rooster's.

643
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,280
You broke his nose,
he ought to have something to show for it.

644
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,573
Anything you put in my mouth,
you're gonna lose.

645
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:41,410
No. You don't understand.

646
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:44,746
You do that, and I'll put
all eight inches of this steel in your ear.

647
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:45,831
All right.

648
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:50,544
But you should know that sudden, serious
brain injury causes the victim to bite down hard.

649
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:54,256
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong,

650
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:59,094
they have to pry the victim's jaws open...
with a crowbar.

651
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,598
Where did you get this shit?

652
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:05,309
I read it.

653
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:09,271
Know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

654
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,649
Honey...

655
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,320
..you shouldn't.

656
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,280
(Groans)

657
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:21,366
RED: Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth...

658
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:23,827
and neither did his friends.

659
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,164
What they did do...
is beat him within an inch of his life.

660
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,375
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

661
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:33,920
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

662
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,010
Time's up, Bogs.

663
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:45,766
It's your world, boss.

664
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:51,313
TANNOY:
Return to your cell blocks for evening count.

665
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,523
All prisoners report for lockdown.

666
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,374
What?

667
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,795
(Gasps)

668
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,091
(Bogs cries in pain)

669
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,555
GUARD: Where's he going?
HADLEY: Grab his ankles.

670
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,684
No! No!

671
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,144
No!

672
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,562
Help me...

673
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:33,939
Aaarghh!

674
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:36,149
(Punching and screaming)

675
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,902
RED:
Two things never happened again after that.

676
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,780
The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again...

677
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:45,742
..and Bogs never walked again.

678
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:50,288
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

679
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:56,086
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest
of his days drinking his food through a straw.

680
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:00,799
I'm thinking Andy could use a nice welcome
back when he gets out of the infirmary.

681
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:05,720
Sounds good to us.
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

682
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,808
The man likes to play chess.

683
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,935
Let's get him some rocks.

684
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,261
Guys...

685
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,680
I got one. I got one. Look.

686
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,226
Heywood, that isn't soapstone.

687
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,520
And it ain't alabaster, either.

688
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:57,230
What are you, a fucking geologist?

689
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,357
He's right. It ain't.

690
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:00,692
Well, what the hell is it?

691
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,320
RED: A horse apple.

692
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:06,531
- Bullshit.
- No, horse shit. Petrified.

693
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,658
(Horse whinnies)

694
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:15,790
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
(Men laugh)

695
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,834
Oh, damn!

696
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:21,838
RED: Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

697
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,717
And by the weekend he was due back,
we had enough rocks

698
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,845
to keep him busy till rapture.

699
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,640
I also got a big shipment in that week.

700
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,267
Cigarettes. Chewing gum.

701
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,852
Sipping whisky.

702
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:39,481
Playing cards with naked ladies on them.
You name it.

703
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,484
And of course, the most important item.

704
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,321
Rita Hayworth herself.

705
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:23,358
GUARD: OK, look alive! Open all tiers.

706
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,777
(Furtively) Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

707
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,071
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

708
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,075
119.

709
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,245
123.

710
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:38,415
(Guards calling out)

711
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,590
On your feet.

712
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,176
Face the wall.

713
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,755
HADLEY: Turn around and face the Warden.

714
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,554
Pleased to see you reading this.

715
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,224
Any favourite passages?

716
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:44,397
"Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not
when the master of the house cometh."

717
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,360
Mark 13:35.

718
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:51,112
I always liked that one.

719
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,697
But I prefer...

720
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:55,492
"I'm the light of the world.

721
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:59,162
He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
but shall have the light of life."

722
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,831
John, Chapter 8, Verse 12.

723
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:05,335
I hear you're good with numbers. How nice.

724
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,546
A man should have a skill.

725
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,092
Wanna explain this?

726
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:16,638
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

727
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,641
A little hobby of mine.

728
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:30,443
(Inhales)

729
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:33,530
It's pretty clean. Some contraband here,

730
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,657
but nothing to get in a twist over.

731
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,579
I can't say I approve of this.

732
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:44,791
But I suppose...

733
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,628
..exceptions can be made.

734
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,307
HADLEY: Lock 'em up!

735
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:05,311
I almost forgot.

736
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:07,647
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

737
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,149
Salvation lies within.

738
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,568
Yes, sir.

739
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,454
RED: Tossing cells was just an excuse.

740
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,583
The truth is, Norton wanted to size Andy up.

741
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:43,391
My wife made that in church group.

742
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:47,020
Very nice, sir.

743
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,064
Do you enjoy working in the laundry?

744
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:53,443
No, sir, not especially.

745
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,321
Perhaps we can find something more...

746
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,448
befitting a man of your education.

747
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,662
(Bird screeches)

748
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,500
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

749
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:09,876
Andy.

750
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,212
I thought I heard you out here!

751
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,340
I've been reassigned to you.

752
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:18,593
I know. They told me. (Chuckles)

753
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,762
Ain't that a kick in the head?

754
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,348
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

755
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,517
Come on.

756
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:27,769
Well, here she is.

757
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,396
Shawshank Prison library.

758
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:33,358
National Geographic.

759
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:36,277
Reader's Digest condensed books.

760
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,613
Louis L'Amour.

761
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,782
Look Magazine.

762
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,368
Erle Stanley Gardners.

763
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:46,955
Every evening,
I load up the cart and make my round.

764
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,166
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

765
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:53,711
Easy-peasy, Japanesey. Any questions?

766
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:56,756
Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

767
00:52:56,841 --> 00:53:02,011
Oh...I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

768
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:05,473
And in all that time,
have you ever had an assistant?

769
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:08,142
No. No, not much to it, really.

770
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:10,144
Well, why me? Why now?

771
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,729
I don't know,

772
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:15,108
but it'll be nice to have some company
down here for a change.

773
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,193
HADLEY: Dufresne!

774
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,580
That's him. That's the one.

775
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,463
I'm Dekins.

776
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,966
(Nervously) I was er...

777
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:44,053
thinking about maybe setting up
some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

778
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:47,891
Oh...

779
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,601
I see.

780
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,937
Well, erm...

781
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,899
..why don't we have a seat,

782
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,026
and talk it over?

783
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:03,489
Brooks,
do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

784
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,711
Thanks.

785
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,421
So...

786
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:22,216
Mr Dekins...

787
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:26,763
And then Andy says to Mr Dekins,
"Do you want your sons to go to Harvard,

788
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,973
- or Yale?"
- He didn't say that?

789
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:31,726
As God is my witness, he did!

790
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,188
Dekins just blinked for a second.
Then he laughed himself silly.

791
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,148
And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.

792
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,608
My ass!

793
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:39,901
Shook his hand.

794
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,946
Hell, I...I near soiled myself! (Laughs)

795
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:47,241
All Andy needed was a suit and a tie
and a little jiggly hula girl on his desk,

796
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:48,660
and he would have been:

797
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,286
"Mr Dufresne, if you please"!

798
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:52,080
Making a few friends, Andy?

799
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,124
I wouldn't say "friends".

800
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:59,212
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

801
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,631
It's a wonderful pet to have.

802
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,633
Got you out of the laundry, though.

803
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,927
Well, it might do more than that.

804
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:09,013
How about expanding the library?
Get some new books in there.

805
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:11,808
If you're gonna ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

806
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:14,352
- Right.
- How do you expect to do that?

807
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:19,691
I mean, get new books in here,
Mr Dufresne, if you please?

808
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,526
Ask the Warden for funds.

809
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:22,860
(Laughter)

810
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:26,239
Son, son. Six wardens
have been through here in my tenure,

811
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:29,951
and I've learned one immutable, universal truth.

812
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,703
Not one of them born...

813
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:36,708
whose asshole wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you asked them for funds.

814
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:39,085
The budget's stretched thin, as it is.

815
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,420
I see.

816
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:44,007
Perhaps I could write to the State Senate
and request funds from them.

817
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:48,511
As far as they're concerned, there's only three
ways to spend money when it comes to prisons:

818
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,680
more walls, more bars and more guards.

819
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:55,184
Still, I'd like to try, with your permission.
A letter a week. They can't ignore me for ever.

820
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:56,811
Sure can.

821
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,772
But you write your letters, if it makes you happy.

822
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:02,108
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

823
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:07,113
RED: So, Andy started writing a letter a week,

824
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,282
just like he said.

825
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:17,415
And, just like Norton said, Andy got no answers.

826
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:30,803
The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

827
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:33,973
The year after that, he did them all...

828
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:36,100
including the Warden's.

829
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:41,272
The year after that, they rescheduled
the start of the intramural season

830
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,399
to coincide with tax season.

831
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:49,947
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

832
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:54,160
So, Moresby Prison issued you your gun,
but you had to pay for it?

833
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,995
Damn right. The holster, too.

834
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,330
That's tax-deductible.

835
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,581
You can write that off.

836
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:02,001
RED: Yes, sir.
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

837
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:05,129
In fact, it got so busy at tax time...

838
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:07,256
he was allowed a staff.

839
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,801
Hey, Red, can you hand me a stack of 1040s?

840
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:12,553
It got me out of the wood shop
a month out of the year,

841
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:15,306
and that was fine by me.

842
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,726
And still...he kept sending those letters.

843
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,900
Red, Andy.

844
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,193
It's Brooks.

845
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,737
(Men shouting)
- Watch the door.

846
00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:31,405
Please, Brooks.

847
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,491
- Just calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

848
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,618
- Stay back!
- What the hell's going on?

849
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,788
You tell me. One second he's fine.
Then out comes the knife.

850
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,332
Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?

851
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,543
Nothing to talk about, goddamn it!

852
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,336
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

853
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,296
Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?

854
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:49,507
It's what they done!

855
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,008
I...I got no choice...

856
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,761
You're not gonna hurt him.
Even Heywood knows that.

857
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:56,472
- Right, Heywood?
- I...I know that, sure.

858
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:59,976
You won't hurt him, because he's a friend,
and you're a reasonable man.

859
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,352
That's right. Right, guys?

860
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,814
- Yes.
- So, put the knife down. Brooks, look at me.

861
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,691
Put the knife down.

862
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:08,985
Brooks...

863
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:11,320
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

864
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:13,739
Brooks, look at his neck. It's bleeding.

865
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:14,991
(Heywood gasps)

866
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,659
It's the only...

867
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,036
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

868
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:21,664
Come on. This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

869
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,791
Put it down.

870
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:27,461
(Brooks sobs)

871
00:58:31,175 --> 00:58:35,887
Come on. Take it easy.
You're going to be all right.

872
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:37,346
HEYWOOD: Him?

873
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:41,100
Hell, what about me?
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat.

874
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:43,811
RED: Shit, Heywood,
you've had worse from shaving.

875
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:46,147
What the hell did you do to set him off, anyway?

876
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,566
Nothing. I come in here to say fare-thee-well.

877
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,736
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

878
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:56,949
I just don't understand what happened in there.
That's all.

879
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:59,619
The old man's as crazy
as a rat in a tin shithouse.

880
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,913
Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you.

881
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:04,999
- I heard he had you shitting in your pants.
- Fuck you!

882
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,459
Would you knock it off?

883
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,878
Brooks ain't no bug.

884
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,796
He's just...

885
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,508
He's just institutionalised.

886
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:17,553
Institutionalised, my ass.

887
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:21,933
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood.
50 years.

888
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:23,726
This is all he knows.

889
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,229
In here, he's an important man.

890
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,772
He's an educated man.

891
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:29,899
Outside, he's nothing.

892
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,737
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

893
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:38,032
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.

894
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,201
You know what I'm trying to say?

895
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:43,037
Red, I do believe you're talking out of your ass.

896
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:47,166
You believe whatever you want, Floyd.

897
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:49,710
But I'm telling you, these walls are funny.

898
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,214
First you hate 'em...

899
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,842
..then you get used to 'em.

900
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:01,138
Enough time passes...

901
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:04,183
you get so you depend on 'em.

902
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:06,602
That's institutionalised.

903
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:08,020
JIGGER: Shit.

904
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:09,689
You can never get like that.

905
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:11,691
Oh, yeah?

906
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:14,360
Say that when you've been here
as long as Brooks has.

907
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,279
Goddamn right.

908
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:21,200
They send you here for life.

909
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:23,327
That's exactly what they take.

910
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:27,331
The part that counts, anyway.

911
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,629
(Jake screeches)

912
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,924
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

913
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,678
You go on, now.

914
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:46,434
You're free.

915
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,201
Bye.

916
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,204
Good luck, Brooks.

917
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:46,535
BROOKS: Dear fellas...

918
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:50,831
I can't believe
how fast things move on the outside.

919
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,166
(Horn blares)

920
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,294
Watch it, old-timer! Are you trying to get killed?

921
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:58,714
I saw an automobile once, when I was a kid,

922
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,675
but now...they're everywhere.

923
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:09,475
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

924
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:32,164
The parole board got me into
this halfway house called The Brewer,

925
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:36,043
and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway.

926
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:43,426
It's hard work, and I try to keep up,
but my hands hurt most of the time.

927
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,511
WOMAN: Make sure your man double-bags.

928
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,847
Last time, the bottom near came out.

929
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:51,225
Make sure you double-bag, like the lady says.
Understand?

930
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,768
Yes, sir. I surely will.

931
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:56,647
BROOKS: I don't think
the store manager likes me very much.

932
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,482
(Pigeons cooing)

933
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:04,405
Sometimes, after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

934
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:09,827
I keep thinking Jake might just show up
and say hello.

935
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,662
But he never does.

936
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:18,127
And I hope, wherever he is,
he's doing OK and making new friends.

937
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:24,592
I have trouble sleeping at night.

938
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:27,428
I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.

939
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:30,473
I wake up, scared.

940
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:34,518
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

941
01:03:36,188 --> 01:03:37,646
Maybe I should get me a gun

942
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:41,609
and rob the Foodway, so they'd send me home.

943
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:44,028
I could shoot the manager, while I was at it.

944
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,030
Sort of like a bonus.

945
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:51,827
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense
any more.

946
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:53,954
I don't like it here.

947
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:56,707
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.

948
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:57,875
I've decided...

949
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,793
not to stay.

950
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:14,683
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.

951
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:16,810
Not for an old crook like me.

952
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,577
(Scraping)

953
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:23,919
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.
Not for an old crook like me.

954
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:29,091
PS. Tell Heywood
I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.

955
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,218
No hard feelings. Brooks."

956
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,981
He should have died in here.

957
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:53,866
HADLEY: What the fuck have you done?
It's a goddamn mess. I'll tell you that.

958
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,039
What's all this?

959
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:04,001
You tell me, fuck-stick.
They're all addressed to you.

960
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,336
Take it.

"Dear Mr Dufresne...

962
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:19,016
In response to your repeated enquiries,

963
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:23,812
the State has allocated the enclosed funds
for your library project."

964
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,230
This is 200 dollars.

965
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:30,235
"In addition, the Library District
has generously responded

966
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,030
with a charitable donation
of used books and sundries.

967
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:35,199
We trust this will fill your needs.

968
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:39,411
We now consider the matter closed.
Please stop sending us letters."

969
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:42,331
I want all this cleared out
before the Warden gets back.

970
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:44,041
Yes, sir.

971
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,171
Good for you, Andy.

972
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,258
Wow!

973
01:06:54,386 --> 01:06:56,428
It only took six years.

974
01:06:57,806 --> 01:07:00,641
From now on,
I'll write two letters a week, instead of one.

975
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:04,269
Oh, I believe you're crazy enough.
You'd better get all this stuff out,

976
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:05,521
like the Captain said.

977
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:09,441
Now, I'm gonna go pinch a loaf.
When I come back, this is all gone, right?

978
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:17,616
Wow.

higher and farther
than anybody in a grey place dares to dream.

1003

flapped into our drab little cage

before I could take requests.

1024

Was it worth it, two weeks in the hole?

1025

Easiest time I ever did.

1026

Bullshit!
There's no such thing as easy time in the hole.

A week in the hole is like a year.

And in here.

1032

That's the beauty of music.
They can't get that from you.

01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:48,804
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

1034
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:54,601
Well, I played a mean harmonica,
as a younger man.

1035
01:11:54,686 --> 01:11:56,478
Lost interest in it, though.

1036
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,397
Didn't make much sense in here.

1037
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,941
Here's where it makes the most sense.

1038
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:03,610
You need it, so you don't forget.

1039
01:12:03,695 --> 01:12:05,028
Forget?

1040
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:07,072
Forget that...

1041
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,199
there are places...

1042
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:13,120
..in the world that aren't made out of stone...

1043
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:15,247
that there's a...

1044
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,165
there's something...

1045
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:20,043
inside that they can't get to...

1046
01:12:20,128 --> 01:12:22,421
that they can't touch.

1047
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:24,339
It's yours.

1048
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,467
What are you talking about?

1049
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,178
Hope.

1050
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,097
Hope?

1051
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:36,643
Let me tell you something, my friend.

1052
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:38,645
Hope is a dangerous thing.

1053
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:42,274
Hope can drive a man insane.

1054
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,277
It's got no use on the inside.

1055
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,988
You'd better get used to that idea.

1056
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,034
Like Brooks did?

1057
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,351
Sit down.

1058
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:27,027
It says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

1059
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:29,738
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1060
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,865
Oh, yes, sir.

1061
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,992
Without a doubt.

1062
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:37,329
And I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

1063
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,000
No danger to society here.

1064
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:44,127
God's honest truth.

1065
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:48,548
Absolutely rehabilitated.

1066
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:00,560
30 years.

1067
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,730
Jesus, when they say it like that...

1068
01:14:03,815 --> 01:14:05,857
You wonder where it went.

1069
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,904
I wonder where ten years went.

1070
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:17,285
Here.

1071
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,496
Little parole rejection present.

1072
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,416
Go ahead and open it.

1073
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:27,295
I had to go through one of your competitors.
I hope you don't mind.

1074
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:29,422
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1075
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,643
It's very pretty, Andy.

1076
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,813
Thank you.

1077
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,650
Are you going to play it?

1078
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:54,865
No.

1079
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:59,244

(Hammering)

1093
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:31,920
RED: Andy was as good as his word.

1094
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,464
He wrote two letters a week instead of one.

1095
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:41,263
In 1959, the State Senate
finally clued into the fact

1096
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:44,182
they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 cheque.

1097
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:50,897
Appropriations Committee voted
an annual payment of $500 just to shut him up.

1098
01:16:50,982 --> 01:16:52,691
And you'd be amazed

1099
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,442
how far Andy could stretch it.

1100
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:57,404
He made deals with book clubs, charity groups.

1101
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:59,864
He bought remaindered books by the pound.

1102
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:02,158
Treasure Island.

1103

1105
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,205
Fiction, adventure.

1106
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:10,834
What's next?

1107
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:13,545
I got here Auto Repair and...

1108
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:15,964
..Soap Carving.

1109
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:19,426

Dumb-ass?

1114
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,694
Dumas. You know what that's about?

1115
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:39,154
Uh-uh.

1116
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:41,948
You'll like it. It's about a prison break.

1117
01:17:42,033 --> 01:17:46,036
We ought to file that under Educational, too,
oughtn't we?

1118
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:50,248
RED: The rest of us did our best to pitch in
when and where we could.

1119

By the year Kennedy was shot,

1120
01:17:53,461 --> 01:17:57,756
Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of rat turds and turpentine

1121
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,134
into the best prison library in New England,

1122
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:05,096
complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.

1123
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:09,351
♪ Lawd I don't know what I'll do-ooo

1125
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:17,025
RED: That was also the year Warden Norton
instituted his famous Inside Out programme.

1126
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:19,819
You may remember reading about it.

1127
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:23,323
It made all the papers
and got his picture in Look Magazine.

1128
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:25,075
No free ride.

1129
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:28,119
But rather a genuine, progressive advance

1130
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,330
in corrections and rehabilitation.

1131
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:33,750
Our inmates, properly supervised,

1132
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:36,586
will be put to work outside these walls,

1133
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,755
performing all manner of public service.

1134
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:42,759
These men can learn
the value of an honest day's labour,

1135
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:46,513
while providing a valuable service
to the community and...

1136
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:51,810
at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr and Mrs John Q Taxpayer.

1137
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:54,562
RED: Of course,
Norton failed to mention to the press

1138
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:57,941
that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1139
01:18:58,025 --> 01:19:01,194
There are a hundred different ways
to skim off the top.

1140
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,863
Men, materials, you name it.

1141
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:07,700
And, oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in.

1142
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:09,911
If this keeps up, you'll put me out of business.

1143
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:12,163
- Ned!
- This pool of slave labour you've got,

1144
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:14,290
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1145
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:18,336
Ned, we're providing
a valuable community service here.

1146
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:20,672
Well, that's fine for the papers

1147
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,257
but I've got a family to feed.

1148
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:24,050
Sam...

1149
01:19:24,135 --> 01:19:26,594
Sam, we go back a long way.

1150
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:29,013
I need this new highway contract.

1151
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:31,307
I don't get it, and I go under.

1152
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:33,435
That's a fact.

1153
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:35,603
You just have some of this fine pie

1154
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:37,730
my missus made especially for you,

1155
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,107
and you think about that.

1156
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,118
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1157
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:53,371
It seems to me I already got
my boys committed elsewhere.

1158
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,834
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.

1159
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:01,671
RED: And behind every shady deal,

1160
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:03,965
behind every dollar earned,

1161
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:07,177
there was Andy, keeping the books.

1162
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:11,681
Two deposits.
Maine National and New England First.

1163
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,808
Night drops as always, sir.

1164
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:46,007
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1165
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:48,885
- Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
- Yes, sir.

1166
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:52,722
Tell them if they overstarch my shirts again,
they'll hear about it from me.

1167
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:54,807
How do I look?

1168
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:57,602
- Very nice, sir.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1169
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,354
The Governor's going to be there.

1170
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:02,857
Want the rest of this?

1171
01:21:02,942 --> 01:21:04,984
The woman can't bake worth shit.

1172
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:08,154
Thank you, sir.

1173
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:14,118
- He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, I hear.
- What you hear isn't half of it.

1174
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:16,663
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of.

1175
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:18,790
Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1176
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:21,751
There's a river of dirty money
running through this place.

1177
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:25,088
But the problem with having all that money
is you'll have to explain

1178
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:27,757
- where it came from.
- That's where I come in.

1179
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:30,343
I channel it, filter it, funnel it.

1180
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:32,971
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

1181
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:35,723
I send that money out into the real world.

1182
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:39,435
- And when it comes back...
- Clean as a virgin's honey pot, huh?

1183
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,728
Cleaner.

1184
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:44,399
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1185
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:51,614
If they ever catch on, though, he's gonna
wind up in here wearing a number himself.

1186
01:21:51,699 --> 01:21:54,951
Now, Red, I thought you had
a little more faith in me than that.

1187
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:58,329
I know you're good, Andy,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1188
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:01,416
Now, anybody gets curious,
the FBI, the IRS, whatever,

1189
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,335
it's gonna lead to somebody.

1190
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,379
Sure it is. But not to me.

1191
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:08,423
And certainly not to the Warden.

1192
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:13,803
All right. Who?

1193
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,597
Randall Stevens.

1194
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:16,806
Who?

1195
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:22,645
The silent silent partner. He's the guilty one,
Your Honour. The man with the bank accounts.

1196
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:24,897
That's where the filtering process starts.

1197
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:28,151
If they trace anything,
it's just going to lead to him.

1198
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:29,819
But who is he?

1199
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:31,946
He's a phantom, an apparition.

1200
01:22:32,031 --> 01:22:33,990
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1201
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:36,242
I conjured him...

1202
01:22:36,327 --> 01:22:38,369
out of thin air.

1203
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:41,247
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1204
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:46,794
Andy, you can't just make a person up.

1205
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:50,006
Sure you can, if you know how
the system works, where the cracks are.

1206
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:53,593
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

1207
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:56,304
Mr Stevens has a birth certificate,

1208
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:58,723
a driver's licence, social security number.

1209
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,016
You're shitting me?

1210
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,060
If they ever trace any of those accounts,

1211
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:05,021
they're going to wind up chasing
a figment of my imagination.

1212
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:07,148
Well, I'll be damned.

1213
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,526
Did I say you were good?

1214
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:12,779
Shit, you're a Rembrandt!

1215
01:23:12,863 --> 01:23:14,906
You know, the funny thing is,

1216
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:18,951
on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1217
01:23:20,037 --> 01:23:22,330
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1218
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:32,465
Ever bother you?

1219
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:36,969
I don't run the scams, Red,
I just process the profits.

1220
01:23:37,054 --> 01:23:39,097
Fine line maybe but...

1221
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:41,891
I also built that library

1222
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:44,602
and used it to help a dozen guys
get a high school diploma.

1223
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:46,562
Why do you think the Warden lets me do it?

1224
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:49,399
To keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1225
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:51,609
Money instead of sheets.

1226
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:54,404
Well, I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

Well, I just stand there,

01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:39,068
Good. Because if we do this,

1275
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:41,863
we do it all the way, 100%, nothing half-assed.

1276
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,074
The thing is, see...

1277
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:48,077
..I don't read so good.

1278
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:50,413
Well.

1279
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,250
You don't read...

1280
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:56,377
so well.

1281
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,505
We'll get to that.

1282
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,383
- R.
- R...

1283
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:03,843
- S.
- S...

1284
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:06,095
RED: So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1285
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:08,556
He started walking him through his ABCs.

1286
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:12,852
Tommy took to it pretty well, too.

1287
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:15,855
The boy found brains he never knew he had.

1288
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:22,028
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1289
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,071
He really liked the kid.

1290
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:27,283
It gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1291
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:30,411
But that wasn't the only reason.

1292
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:32,914
Prison time is slow time.

1293
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:36,250
So you do what you can to keep going.

1294
01:27:36,335 --> 01:27:38,544
Some fellas collect stamps.

1295
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:41,172
Others build matchstick houses.

1296
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:44,592
Andy built a library.

1297
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:47,720
Now he needed a new project.

1298
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:49,847
Tommy was it.

1299
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:54,143
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1300
01:27:54,227 --> 01:27:57,813
The same reason
he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1301
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,733
In prison,

1302
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,903
a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1303
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:09,825
By 1966, right about the time
Tommy was getting ready to take his exams,

1304
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:11,869
it was lovely Raquel.

1305
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,873
(Clock ticks)

1306
01:28:29,179 --> 01:28:30,179
Time.

1307
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:37,478
Well?

1308
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:40,147
Well, it's for shit.

1309
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:42,733
I wasted a whole fucking year of my time

1310
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:45,987
- with this bullshit.
- It's probably not as bad as you think.

1311
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:49,782
It's worse. I didn't get one thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1312
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:52,368
Let's see how the score comes out.

1313
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:55,037
Well, I'll tell you how the goddamn score
comes out.

1314
01:28:56,873 --> 01:28:58,791
Two points right there.

1315
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:00,668
There's your goddamn score!

1316
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:04,547
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5x5 is 25.

1317
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:07,174
Fuck this place!

1318
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:08,467
Fuck it!

1319
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:30,072
I feel bad. I let him down.

1320
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:32,199
Ah, that's crap, kid.

1321
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:33,784
He's proud of you.

1322
01:29:33,869 --> 01:29:36,996
We've been friends a long time
so I know him as good as anybody.

1323
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,957
- A smart fellow, ain't he?
- As smart as they come.

1324
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:42,084
He used to be a banker on the outside.

1325
01:29:42,169 --> 01:29:44,211
What's he in here for, anyway?

1326
01:29:44,296 --> 01:29:45,796
Murder.

1327
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:48,632
The hell you say!

1328
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:53,054
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1329
01:29:54,139 --> 01:29:56,599
He caught his wife in bed with some golf pro.

1330
01:29:56,683 --> 01:29:58,726
He greased them both.

1331
01:30:06,693 --> 01:30:08,527
What?

1332
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:10,988
About four years ago,

1333
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:14,116
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

1334
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:18,454
I stole a car. It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1335
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:21,832
About six months left to go,

1336
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:23,959
I get a new cellmate in.

1337
01:30:24,044 --> 01:30:25,878
Elmo Blatch.

1338
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:28,506
Big, twitchy fucker.

1339
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,841
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.

1340
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:32,968
You know what I'm saying?

1341
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:35,096
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1342
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:38,390
He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.

1343
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:40,351
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.

1344
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:43,395
You'd cut a loud fart,
he'd jump three feet in the air.

1345
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:46,607
Talked all the time, too.

1346
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:49,026
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1347
01:30:49,111 --> 01:30:51,153
Places he'd been in,

1348
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:53,906
jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked.

1349
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:56,367
Even people he'd killed.

1350
01:30:58,245 --> 01:31:00,579
People who gave him shit.

1351
01:31:01,665 --> 01:31:03,707
That's how he put it.

1352
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:05,334
So...

1353
01:31:05,418 --> 01:31:07,461
one night, like a joke,

1354
01:31:08,547 --> 01:31:11,841
I say to him, I say,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

1355
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:13,717
So he says...

1356
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:17,388
I got me this job one time
bussing tables at a country club.

1357
01:31:18,557 --> 01:31:22,101
So I could case
all these big rich pricks that come in.

1358
01:31:24,563 --> 01:31:26,522
So I pick out this guy,

1359
01:31:27,607 --> 01:31:30,151
go in one night and do his place.

1360
01:31:32,362 --> 01:31:34,363
He wakes up.

1361
01:31:34,447 --> 01:31:36,448
He gives me shit.

1362
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:39,577
So I killed him.

1363
01:31:40,662 --> 01:31:42,705
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1364
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:46,917
That's the best part.

1365
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:51,213
She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro.

1366
01:31:51,298 --> 01:31:53,340
But she's married to some other guy.

1367
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:56,468
Some hotshot banker.

1368
01:31:58,305 --> 01:32:00,347
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1369
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:15,321
I have to say
that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

1370
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:19,867
What amazes me most is
you were taken in by it.

1371
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:21,577
Sir?

1372
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:23,329
Well...

1373
01:32:23,413 --> 01:32:26,790
it's obvious this fella Williams
is impressed with you.

1374
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:28,959
He hears your tale of woe

1375
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:31,962
and quite naturally wants to cheer you up.

1376
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:34,089
He's young, not terribly bright.

1377
01:32:34,174 --> 01:32:38,052
Not surprising he wouldn't know
what a state he'd put you in.

1378
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:40,262
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1379
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:44,391
Well, let's say, for the moment,
this Blatch does exist.

1380
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:47,603
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry,

1381
01:32:47,687 --> 01:32:49,897
"Yes, I did it! I confess!

1382
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:52,191
And by the way,
add a life term to my sentence"?

1383
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:55,444
That doesn't matter.
With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

1384
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:58,739
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

1385
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,866
The chances are he'd be released by now.

1386
01:33:00,951 --> 01:33:03,535
They'd have his last address,
names of relatives.

1387
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:05,746
There's a chance, isn't there?

1388
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:09,708
How can you be so obtuse?

1389
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:11,252
What?

1390
01:33:12,796 --> 01:33:14,630
What did you call me?

1391
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:16,548
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1392
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:18,425
Son, you're forgetting yourself.

1393
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:21,345
The country club will have his old timecards,

1394
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:23,514
records, W-2s,

1395
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:27,643
- with his name on them.
- If you indulge this fantasy, that's your business.

1396
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:31,647
- Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
- Sir, if I were to ever get out,

1397
01:33:31,773 --> 01:33:36,735
I would never mention what goes on in here.
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering money.

1398
01:33:38,571 --> 01:33:41,573
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1399
01:33:41,658 --> 01:33:43,492
Not in this office.

1400
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:45,661
Not anywhere! Get in here now.

1401
01:33:45,745 --> 01:33:48,998
I'm just trying to set your mind at ease,
that's all. Sir, I...

1402
01:33:49,082 --> 01:33:50,457
Solitary. A month.

1403
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:52,710
- Yes, sir.
- What's the matter with you?

1404
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:56,005
- Get him out of here.
- This is my chance to get out! Don't you see?

1405
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:58,048
It's my life! Don't you understand?

1406
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:00,592
- Get him out! Get him out!
- This is my life!

1407
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:01,927
No!

1408
01:34:02,012 --> 01:34:03,846
A month in the hole.

1409
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:06,515
It's the longest damn stretch I ever heard of.

1410
01:34:06,599 --> 01:34:08,392
It's all my fault.

1411
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:09,893
Oh, bullshit.

1412
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:13,272
You didn't pull the trigger
and you certainly didn't convict him.

1413
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:15,733
Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?

1414
01:34:15,817 --> 01:34:17,985
I mean, for real innocent?

1415
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:20,112
It looks that way.

1416
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:22,239
Sweet Jesus.

1417
01:34:22,324 --> 01:34:24,366
How long's he been here now?

1418
01:34:24,451 --> 01:34:26,493
1947. What is that?

1419
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:28,120
- 19 years.
TOMMY: 19 years...

1420
01:34:28,204 --> 01:34:30,789
GUARD: Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1421
01:34:33,209 --> 01:34:35,419
- Paxon, Edward.
- Yeah.

1422
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:39,590
What you got? Board of Education.

1423
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:42,343
- The son of a bitch mailed it.
- Looks like he did.

1424
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:45,471
Are you gonna open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1425
01:34:45,555 --> 01:34:47,598
The thumb up my butt sounds better.

1426
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:51,393
Hey, Skeet, come on,
give me that, you shithead.

1427
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:54,646
- Floyd, come on.
- Over here, over here!

1428
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:57,775
Hey, Red!

1429
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:01,320
Come on, will you throw that away, please?

1430
01:35:06,993 --> 01:35:09,036
Well, shit.

1431
01:35:21,257 --> 01:35:23,967
The kid passed. C+ average.

1432
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:26,095
Thought you'd like to know.

1433
01:35:42,695 --> 01:35:44,738
The Warden wants to talk.

1434
01:35:58,169 --> 01:35:59,294
Out here?

1435
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:01,422
That's what the man said.

1436
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:19,565
Warden?

1437
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:21,692
Tommy.

1438
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:28,657
Tommy...

1439
01:36:28,741 --> 01:36:32,786
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1440
01:36:34,247 --> 01:36:36,290
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1441
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,852
We got a situation here.

1442
01:36:57,937 --> 01:36:59,980
I think you can appreciate that.

1443
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:01,523
Yes, sir.

1444
01:37:01,608 --> 01:37:03,108
I sure can.

1445
01:37:03,193 --> 01:37:07,196
I tell you, son, this thing really came along
and knocked my wind out.

1446
01:37:08,948 --> 01:37:11,450
It's got me up nights, that's the truth.

1447
01:37:13,703 --> 01:37:15,746
The right thing to do.

1448
01:37:17,123 --> 01:37:20,083
Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1449
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:23,837
You understand?

1450
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:27,299
I need your help, son.

1451
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,802
If I'm going to move on this,

1452
01:37:30,887 --> 01:37:33,555
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

1453
01:37:35,141 --> 01:37:38,560
I have to know
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

1454
01:37:38,645 --> 01:37:40,187
Yes, sir.

1455
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:41,855
Absolutely.

1456
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:45,025
Would you be willing
to swear before a judge and jury,

1457
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:47,486
having placed your hand on the Good Book

1458
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:50,239
and taken an oath before Almighty God himself?

1459
01:37:50,323 --> 01:37:52,407
Just give me that chance.

1460
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:57,996
That's what I thought.

1461
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:32,531
(Keys rattle)

1462
01:38:45,128 --> 01:38:47,170
I'm sure by now you've heard...

1463
01:38:48,464 --> 01:38:49,798
A terrible thing.

1464
01:38:51,301 --> 01:38:54,845
A man that young, less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1465
01:38:55,972 --> 01:38:58,557
It broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

1466
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:01,685
Truly, it did.

1467
01:39:03,771 --> 01:39:05,814
We just have to put it behind us.

1468
01:39:08,026 --> 01:39:09,401
Move on.

1469
01:39:10,903 --> 01:39:12,738
I'm done.

1470
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:15,866
Everything stops.

1471
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:19,745
Get someone else to run your scams.

1472
01:39:21,122 --> 01:39:23,165
Nothing stops.

1473
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:26,293
Nothing.

1474
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:30,130
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1475
01:39:32,050 --> 01:39:34,635
No more protection from the guards.

1476
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,054
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton

1477
01:39:37,138 --> 01:39:39,264
and cast you down with the Sodomites.

1478
01:39:41,059 --> 01:39:43,518
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1479
01:39:44,854 --> 01:39:46,897
And the library?

1480
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,106
Gone.

1481
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:50,525
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1482
01:39:51,653 --> 01:39:54,404
We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.

1483
01:39:54,489 --> 01:39:56,531
They'll see the flames for miles.

1484
01:39:56,616 --> 01:39:59,076
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1485
01:40:00,703 --> 01:40:02,621
You understand me?

1486
01:40:02,705 --> 01:40:04,748
Catching my drift?

1487
01:40:07,877 --> 01:40:09,920
Or am I being obtuse?

1488
01:40:21,099 --> 01:40:23,183
Give him another month to think about it.

1489
01:40:31,734 --> 01:40:33,777
(Lock clicks)

1490
01:41:10,815 --> 01:41:13,859
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

1491
01:41:13,943 --> 01:41:15,986
Like a closed book.

1492
01:41:17,238 --> 01:41:19,990
Complained about it all the time.

1493
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:22,117
She was beautiful.

1494
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:26,413
God, I loved her.

1495
01:41:29,459 --> 01:41:31,752
I just didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1496
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:36,339
I killed her, Red.

1497
01:41:37,842 --> 01:41:39,885
I didn't pull the trigger.

1498
01:41:41,345 --> 01:41:43,388
But I drove her away.

1499
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:47,184
That's why she died, because of me.

1500
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:49,311
The way I am.

1501
01:41:57,695 --> 01:41:59,738
That don't make you a murderer.

1502
01:42:02,992 --> 01:42:05,035
A bad husband, maybe.

1503
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:11,833
Feel bad about it if you want to,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1504
01:42:11,918 --> 01:42:13,335
No, I didn't.

1505
01:42:13,419 --> 01:42:15,420
Somebody else did.

1506
01:42:16,756 --> 01:42:18,799
And I wound up in here.

1507
01:42:21,219 --> 01:42:23,261
Bad luck, I guess.

1508
01:42:26,224 --> 01:42:27,933
Yeah.

1509
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:30,310
It floats around.

1510
01:42:30,394 --> 01:42:32,854
It's got to land on somebody.

1511
01:42:32,939 --> 01:42:35,148
It was my turn, that's all.

1512
01:42:36,275 --> 01:42:38,693
I was in the path of the tornado.

1513
01:42:45,326 --> 01:42:49,037
I just didn't expect
the storm would last as long as it has.

1514
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:55,043
Do you think you'll ever get out of here?

1515
01:42:56,337 --> 01:42:57,963
Me?

1516
01:43:00,299 --> 01:43:01,716
Yeah.

1517
01:43:02,802 --> 01:43:04,719
One day, when I've got a long, white beard

1518
01:43:04,846 --> 01:43:08,306
and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs,
they'll let me out.

1519
01:43:10,268 --> 01:43:12,310
I tell you where I'd go.

1520
01:43:13,563 --> 01:43:15,188
Zihuatanejo.

1521
01:43:15,273 --> 01:43:17,190
Zi...what?

1522
01:43:17,275 --> 01:43:19,317
Zihuatanejo.

1523
01:43:19,402 --> 01:43:21,444
It's in Mexico.

1524
01:43:23,281 --> 01:43:25,448
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1525
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:29,119
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1526
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:30,662
No.

1527
01:43:30,746 --> 01:43:32,789
They say it has no memory.

1528
01:43:35,293 --> 01:43:37,794
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

1529
01:43:39,422 --> 01:43:41,464
A warm place with no memory.

1530
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:47,053
Open up a little hotel,

1531
01:43:48,931 --> 01:43:50,807
right on the beach.

1532
01:43:50,892 --> 01:43:52,934
Buy some worthless old boat,

1533
01:43:53,019 --> 01:43:55,061
fix it up new.

1534
01:43:58,065 --> 01:43:59,274
Take my guests out.

1535
01:43:59,358 --> 01:44:01,401
Charter fishing.

1536
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:07,949
Zihuatanejo, huh?

1537
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:14,456
In a place like that, I could use a man
who knows how to get things.

1538
01:44:20,922 --> 01:44:23,590
I don't think I could make it on the outside, Andy.

1539
01:44:30,389 --> 01:44:32,432
I've been in here most of my life.

1540
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:35,769
I'm an institutional man now.

1541
01:44:35,853 --> 01:44:37,896
Just like Brooks was.

1542
01:44:39,357 --> 01:44:41,608
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1543
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:43,735
I don't think so.

1544
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:50,617
I mean...in here, I'm the guy
who can get things for you, sure.

1545
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:54,621
But outside, all you need is the Yellow Pages.

1546
01:44:54,705 --> 01:44:57,082
Hell, I wouldn't even know where to begin.

1547
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:01,544
The Pacific Ocean?

1548
01:45:01,629 --> 01:45:03,672
Shit.

1549
01:45:03,756 --> 01:45:06,925
- About scare me to death, something that big.
- Not me.

1550
01:45:07,009 --> 01:45:10,428
I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover.

1551
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:16,017
Whatever mistakes I've made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1552
01:45:16,102 --> 01:45:18,228
That hotel, that boat.

1553
01:45:19,855 --> 01:45:21,982
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1554
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:29,531
I don't think you ought to be
doing this to yourself, Andy.

1555
01:45:29,615 --> 01:45:31,658
These are just shitty pipe dreams.

1556
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:34,703
I mean, Mexico is way the hell down there
and you're in here.

1557
01:45:34,787 --> 01:45:36,830
And that's the way it is.

1558
01:45:36,914 --> 01:45:39,499
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1559
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:43,336
It's down there and I'm in here.

1560
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:48,842
I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really.

1561
01:45:51,721 --> 01:45:53,763
Get busy living

1562
01:45:53,848 --> 01:45:56,725
or get busy dying.

1563
01:46:00,563 --> 01:46:02,605
Andy.

1564
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:07,152
Red.

1565
01:46:08,237 --> 01:46:10,655
If you ever get out of here, do me a favour.

1566
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:12,574
Sure, Andy.

1567
01:46:12,658 --> 01:46:13,950
Anything.

1568
01:46:15,077 --> 01:46:18,496
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1569
01:46:20,541 --> 01:46:24,335
- Well, just... There's a lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1570
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:26,463
It's got a long rock wall

1571
01:46:26,547 --> 01:46:28,465
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1572
01:46:28,549 --> 01:46:31,217
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

1573
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:35,305
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1574
01:46:36,557 --> 01:46:40,351
We went there for a picnic
and made love under that oak.

1575
01:46:41,854 --> 01:46:43,897
I asked and she said yes.

1576
01:46:48,069 --> 01:46:50,111
Promise me, Red,

1577
01:46:50,196 --> 01:46:52,197
if you ever get out,

1578
01:46:52,281 --> 01:46:54,282
find that spot.

1579
01:46:55,367 --> 01:47:00,830
At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that has
no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.

1580
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:03,374
A piece of black, volcanic glass.

1581
01:47:06,587 --> 01:47:09,380
There's something buried under it
I want you to have.

1582
01:47:09,465 --> 01:47:11,466
What, Andy?

1583
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:13,593
What's buried under there?

1584
01:47:15,429 --> 01:47:18,765
You'll have to pry it up to see.

1585
01:47:24,188 --> 01:47:26,231
No, I'm telling you, the guy is...

1586
01:47:27,316 --> 01:47:29,359
He's talking funnier.

1587
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:32,821
- I'm really worried about him.
- We ought to keep an eye on him.

1588
01:47:32,905 --> 01:47:36,908
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's got that cell all to himself.

1589
01:47:38,035 --> 01:47:39,494
Oh, Lord.

1590
01:47:39,578 --> 01:47:41,579
What?

1591
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:45,625
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1592
01:47:45,709 --> 01:47:49,212
- He asked me for a length of rope.
- Rope?

1593
01:47:49,296 --> 01:47:51,131
Six feet long.

1594
01:47:51,215 --> 01:47:52,674
And you gave it to him?

1595
01:47:52,758 --> 01:47:55,385
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

1596
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:57,137
Jesus, Heywood.

1597
01:47:57,221 --> 01:47:59,472
Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?

1598
01:47:59,557 --> 01:48:01,474
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1599
01:48:01,559 --> 01:48:02,559
No.

1600
01:48:03,644 --> 01:48:05,812
Andy would never do that.

1601
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:07,939
Never.

1602
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:11,067
I don't know.

1603
01:48:13,112 --> 01:48:15,155
Every man has his breaking point.

1604
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:19,075
Lickety-split.

1605
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:21,995
- I want to get home.
- Just about finished, sir.

1606
01:48:38,137 --> 01:48:40,180
Three deposits tonight.

1607
01:48:48,606 --> 01:48:50,648
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1608
01:48:50,733 --> 01:48:54,152
And shine my shoes.
I want 'em looking like mirrors.

1609
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:55,570
Yes, sir.

1610
01:49:00,910 --> 01:49:02,577
It's good having you back, Andy.

1611
01:49:02,661 --> 01:49:05,371
The place wasn't the same without you.

1612
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:09,584
(Whistles)

1613
01:49:52,461 --> 01:49:55,171
GUARD: Lights out!
(Click of light switches)

1614
01:49:59,551 --> 01:50:01,594
(Footsteps)

1615
01:50:07,476 --> 01:50:09,519
(Outer door closes)

1616
01:50:25,953 --> 01:50:28,204
RED: I've had some long nights in stir.

1617
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:32,000
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts,

1618
01:50:32,084 --> 01:50:33,876
time can draw out like a blade.

1619
01:50:33,961 --> 01:50:36,004
(Thunder rumbles)

1620
01:50:40,301 --> 01:50:42,593
That was the longest night of my life.

1621
01:50:52,855 --> 01:50:55,148
(Gate buzzer)

1622
01:50:58,777 --> 01:51:00,361
GUARD: Give me a count.

1623
01:51:04,742 --> 01:51:06,784
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1624
01:51:06,869 --> 01:51:08,202
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1625
01:51:08,287 --> 01:51:11,873
- Tier 3 North. Clear.
- Man missing on Tier 2.

1626
01:51:11,957 --> 01:51:15,043
- Cell 245.
- Dufresne.

1627
01:51:15,127 --> 01:51:18,004
Get your ass out here, boy.
You're holding up the show.

1628
01:51:20,549 --> 01:51:24,552
Don't make me come down there.
I'll thump your skull for you.

1629
01:51:32,186 --> 01:51:35,563
Damn it, Dufresne, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1630
01:51:35,647 --> 01:51:38,733
You'd better be sick or dead in there,
I shit you not!

1631
01:51:38,817 --> 01:51:40,610
You hear me?

1632
01:51:47,159 --> 01:51:49,202
Oh, my holy God.

1633
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:03,383
(Siren wails)

1634
01:52:06,095 --> 01:52:08,763
I want every man on this cell block questioned.

1635
01:52:08,847 --> 01:52:11,015
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1636
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:12,266
Him!

1637
01:52:14,228 --> 01:52:16,270
Open 237.

1638
01:52:19,316 --> 01:52:21,442
What do you mean, he just wasn't here?

1639
01:52:21,527 --> 01:52:23,069
Don't say that to me, Haig.

1640
01:52:23,153 --> 01:52:25,405
Don't say that to me again.

1641
01:52:25,489 --> 01:52:26,572
But, sir, he wasn't.

1642
01:52:26,657 --> 01:52:28,825
I can see that, Haig!

1643
01:52:28,909 --> 01:52:30,660
You think I'm blind?

1644
01:52:30,744 --> 01:52:33,830
Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig?

1645
01:52:33,914 --> 01:52:34,914
No, sir.

1646
01:52:34,998 --> 01:52:37,041
What about you?

1647
01:52:37,126 --> 01:52:38,960
Are you blind?

1648
01:52:39,044 --> 01:52:41,587
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1649
01:52:41,672 --> 01:52:44,966
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. See? Right there.

1650
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:46,884
Dufresne.

1651
01:52:48,178 --> 01:52:49,846
He was in his cell at lights out.

1652
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:53,099
It stands to reason
he'd still be here in the morning.

1653
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:56,102
I want him found.

1654
01:52:56,186 --> 01:52:58,771
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast.

1655
01:52:58,856 --> 01:52:59,856
Now!

1656
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:01,357
Yes, sir!

1657
01:53:02,526 --> 01:53:05,111
Let's go, let's go!
Move your butts! Move it!

1658
01:53:07,948 --> 01:53:08,948
Stand.

1659
01:53:10,117 --> 01:53:11,367
Well?

1660
01:53:14,746 --> 01:53:15,872
Well, what?

1661
01:53:15,956 --> 01:53:19,375
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1662
01:53:20,461 --> 01:53:22,086
He must have said something.

1663
01:53:22,171 --> 01:53:24,213
No, sir, Warden.

1664
01:53:24,298 --> 01:53:25,715
Not a word.

1665
01:53:27,759 --> 01:53:29,719
Lord, it's a miracle!

1666
01:53:30,804 --> 01:53:33,264
A man up and vanished like a fart in the wind.

1667
01:53:33,348 --> 01:53:35,099
Nothing left but...

1668
01:53:35,184 --> 01:53:38,102
some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1669
01:53:38,187 --> 01:53:39,937
And that cupcake on the wall.

1670
01:53:40,022 --> 01:53:41,647
Let's ask her.

1671
01:53:41,732 --> 01:53:45,651
Maybe she knows. What say there,
Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking?

1672
01:53:46,778 --> 01:53:47,820
Ah...

1673
01:53:47,905 --> 01:53:49,322
I guess not.

1674
01:53:49,406 --> 01:53:52,283
Why should she be any different?

1675
01:53:52,367 --> 01:53:54,827
This is a conspiracy.

1676
01:53:54,912 --> 01:53:57,121
That's what this is.

1677
01:53:57,206 --> 01:53:58,748
One big...

1678
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:01,584
damn conspiracy!

1679
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:04,337
And everyone's in on it!

1680
01:54:04,421 --> 01:54:05,671
Including her!

1681
01:54:07,049 --> 01:54:08,674
(Clattering)

1682
01:54:32,491 --> 01:54:34,158
(Sirens blare)

1683
01:54:40,374 --> 01:54:42,250
RED: In 1966,

1684
01:54:42,334 --> 01:54:45,002
Andy Dufresne escaped

1685
01:54:45,087 --> 01:54:47,129
from Shawshank Prison.

1686
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:51,592
All they found of him
was a muddy set of prison clothes,

1687
01:54:51,677 --> 01:54:53,719
a bar of soap

1688
01:54:53,804 --> 01:54:58,140
and an old rock hammer
damn near worn down to the nub.

1689
01:55:02,563 --> 01:55:07,400
I remember thinking it would take a man
600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1690
01:55:07,484 --> 01:55:10,152
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1691
01:55:28,755 --> 01:55:30,798
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1692
01:55:31,883 --> 01:55:35,386
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

1693
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:37,763
An Ice Age here,

1694
01:55:37,848 --> 01:55:40,391
a million years of mountain-building there.

1695
01:55:41,476 --> 01:55:43,853
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

1696
01:55:45,105 --> 01:55:47,148
That's all it takes, really.

1697
01:55:47,232 --> 01:55:49,275
Pressure...

1698
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:51,235
and time.

1699
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:54,614
That and a big goddamn poster.

1700
01:55:55,741 --> 01:55:57,783
(Coughing)

1701
01:55:57,868 --> 01:55:59,201
Like I said,

1702
01:55:59,286 --> 01:56:02,997
in prison, a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1703
01:56:05,834 --> 01:56:11,005
It turns out Andy's favourite hobby
was toting his wall out into the exercise yard.

1704
01:56:11,089 --> 01:56:13,132
A handful at a time.

1705
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:17,178
I guess after Tommy was killed,

1706
01:56:17,262 --> 01:56:20,097
Andy decided he'd been here
just about long enough.

1707
01:56:20,182 --> 01:56:22,350
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1708
01:56:23,685 --> 01:56:25,728
I'm just about finished, sir.

1709
01:56:47,167 --> 01:56:49,210
Three deposits tonight.

1710
01:56:56,426 --> 01:56:58,427
Andy did like he was told.

1711
01:56:59,513 --> 01:57:02,973
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.

1712
01:57:06,603 --> 01:57:08,646
The guard simply didn't notice.

1713
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:10,773
Neither did I.

1714
01:57:10,857 --> 01:57:15,152
I mean, seriously, how often
do you really look at a man's shoes?

1715
01:57:49,896 --> 01:57:51,939
(Thunderclap)

1716
01:59:19,236 --> 01:59:25,407
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards
of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

1717
01:59:25,492 --> 01:59:26,659
(Gags)

1718
01:59:26,743 --> 01:59:28,744
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1719
01:59:28,829 --> 01:59:30,871
(Coughs and spits)

1720
01:59:33,458 --> 01:59:35,626
500 yards.

1721
01:59:36,711 --> 01:59:39,171
That's the length of five football fields.

1722
01:59:40,257 --> 01:59:42,466
Just shy of half a mile.

1723
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:25,718
(Laughs)

1724
02:00:37,731 --> 02:00:42,276
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her little secret,

1725
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:45,779
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before

1726
02:00:45,864 --> 02:00:48,282
strode into the Maine National Bank.

1727
02:00:48,366 --> 02:00:50,409
Until that moment,

1728
02:00:50,493 --> 02:00:52,369
he didn't exist,

1729
02:00:52,454 --> 02:00:53,787
except on paper.

1730
02:00:53,872 --> 02:00:54,914
May I help you?

1731
02:00:54,998 --> 02:00:57,041
RED: He had all the proper ID,

1732
02:00:57,125 --> 02:01:00,753
driver's licence, birth certificate,
social security card.

1733
02:01:00,837 --> 02:01:04,131
And the signature was a spot-on match.

1734
02:01:04,215 --> 02:01:07,259
I must say, I'm sorry to be losing your business.

1735
02:01:07,344 --> 02:01:09,345
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1736
02:01:09,429 --> 02:01:11,221
Thank you.

1737
02:01:11,306 --> 02:01:13,098
I'm sure I will.

1738
02:01:13,183 --> 02:01:15,309
Here's your cashier's cheque, sir.

1739
02:01:15,393 --> 02:01:17,436
Will there be anything else?

1740
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:18,520
Please...

1741
02:01:18,605 --> 02:01:21,690
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

1742
02:01:21,775 --> 02:01:23,984
I'd be happy to.

1743
02:01:24,069 --> 02:01:26,362
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

1744
02:01:26,488 --> 02:01:31,241
RED: Mr Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1745
02:01:32,452 --> 02:01:38,916
All told, he blew town with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1746
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,460
Severance pay for 19 years.

1747
02:01:41,544 --> 02:01:43,587
(Phone rings)

1748
02:01:49,594 --> 02:01:51,845
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1749
02:01:59,562 --> 02:02:01,605
(Sirens wail)

1750
02:02:30,844 --> 02:02:32,845
(Sirens approaching)

1751
02:02:44,607 --> 02:02:47,568
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1752
02:02:47,694 --> 02:02:52,322
If you give up the right to remain silent, anything
you say will be held against you in court.

1753
02:02:52,407 --> 02:02:54,283
RED: I wasn't there to see it.

1754
02:02:54,367 --> 02:02:59,204
But I hear Byron Hadley started sobbing
like a little girl when they took him away.

1755
02:03:04,669 --> 02:03:07,421
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

1756
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:24,897
Samuel Norton?

1757
02:03:24,981 --> 02:03:28,192
- We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.
(Banging on door)

1758
02:03:31,112 --> 02:03:32,237
Norton!

1759
02:03:32,322 --> 02:03:33,989
Open the door.

1760
02:03:34,074 --> 02:03:35,783
I'm not sure which key it is.

1761
02:03:38,703 --> 02:03:40,329
Norton!

1762
02:03:45,835 --> 02:03:47,878
Make it easy on yourself, Norton.

1763
02:03:59,224 --> 02:04:02,810
RED: I like to think
the last thing that went through his head,

1764
02:04:02,894 --> 02:04:04,603
other than that bullet,

1765
02:04:04,687 --> 02:04:08,649
was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1766
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:11,443
Carter, James...

1767
02:04:11,528 --> 02:04:14,905
RED: Not long after the Warden
deprived us of his company,

1768
02:04:14,989 --> 02:04:17,199
I got a postcard in the mail.

1769
02:04:18,952 --> 02:04:21,370
It was blank but the postmark said...

1770
02:04:21,454 --> 02:04:24,206
Fort Hancock, Texas.

1771
02:04:24,290 --> 02:04:26,333
Fort Hancock.

1772
02:04:26,417 --> 02:04:28,460
Right on the border.

1773
02:04:28,545 --> 02:04:30,587
That's where Andy crossed.

1774
02:04:30,672 --> 02:04:34,508
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down,

1775
02:04:35,593 --> 02:04:37,636
it always makes me laugh.

1776
02:04:39,097 --> 02:04:41,140
Andy Dufresne,

1777
02:04:41,224 --> 02:04:43,600
who crawled through a river of shit

1778
02:04:43,685 --> 02:04:45,727
and came out clean on the other side.

1779
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:49,022
Andy Dufresne,

1780
02:04:49,107 --> 02:04:51,024
headed for the Pacific.

1781
02:04:53,611 --> 02:04:55,654
Hadley's got him by the toes, right?

1782
02:04:55,738 --> 02:04:59,950
And he says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1783
02:05:00,034 --> 02:05:03,203
RED: Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1784
02:05:03,288 --> 02:05:05,539
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1785
02:05:05,623 --> 02:05:08,125
"These friends of mine
could use a couple of beers!"

1786
02:05:08,209 --> 02:05:10,252
- And he got it.
- And he got it!

1787
02:05:11,462 --> 02:05:13,839
RED: Sometimes it makes me sad, though,

1788
02:05:13,923 --> 02:05:15,966
Andy being gone.

1789
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:20,012
I have to remind myself
that some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1790
02:05:21,139 --> 02:05:23,182
Their feathers are just too bright.

1791
02:05:24,767 --> 02:05:26,810
And when they fly away,

1792
02:05:26,895 --> 02:05:30,772
the part of you that knows
it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1793
02:05:32,567 --> 02:05:34,026
But still...

1794
02:05:34,110 --> 02:05:38,238
the place you live in is that much more drab
and empty that they're gone.

1795
02:05:42,827 --> 02:05:45,037
I guess I just miss my friend.

1796
02:06:09,062 --> 02:06:10,896
Please sit down.

1797
02:06:16,527 --> 02:06:18,654
Ellis Boyd Redding.

1798
02:06:18,738 --> 02:06:22,115
Your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1799
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:24,534
Do you feel you've been rehabilitated?

1800
02:06:26,704 --> 02:06:28,747
Rehabilitated?

1801
02:06:30,333 --> 02:06:32,376
Well, now, let me see.

1802
02:06:33,461 --> 02:06:35,754
You know, I don't have any idea
what that means.

1803
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:40,133
Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society...

1804
02:06:40,218 --> 02:06:42,719
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1805
02:06:45,139 --> 02:06:47,182
To me, it's just a made-up word.

1806
02:06:48,268 --> 02:06:50,519
A politician's word so that...

1807
02:06:50,603 --> 02:06:56,066
young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie and have a job.

1808
02:06:58,528 --> 02:07:00,570
What do you really want to know?

1809
02:07:01,781 --> 02:07:03,699
Am I sorry for what I did?

1810
02:07:03,783 --> 02:07:05,450
Well, are you?

1811
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:09,663
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

1812
02:07:11,291 --> 02:07:14,376
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1813
02:07:18,214 --> 02:07:20,257
I look back on the way I was then.

1814
02:07:22,885 --> 02:07:24,928
A young...

1815
02:07:25,013 --> 02:07:28,056
stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

1816
02:07:31,936 --> 02:07:33,979
I wanna talk to him.

1817
02:07:35,398 --> 02:07:37,524
I wanna try and talk some sense to him,

1818
02:07:38,609 --> 02:07:40,652
tell him the way things are.

1819
02:07:42,864 --> 02:07:44,906
But I can't.

1820
02:07:46,159 --> 02:07:48,201
That kid's long gone.

1821
02:07:49,537 --> 02:07:51,580
This old man is all that's left.

1822
02:07:53,750 --> 02:07:55,208
I gotta live with that.

1823
02:07:56,586 --> 02:07:58,378
Rehabilitated?

1824
02:07:58,463 --> 02:08:00,464
It's just a bullshit word.

1825
02:08:00,548 --> 02:08:06,428
So you go on and stamp your form, sonny,
and stop wasting my time.

1826
02:08:07,555 --> 02:08:09,598
Because to tell you the truth,

1827
02:08:09,682 --> 02:08:12,142
I don't give a shit.

1828
02:08:50,306 --> 02:08:52,349
(Gate closes)

1829
02:09:11,786 --> 02:09:13,829
(Siren passes outside)

1830
02:09:38,396 --> 02:09:40,439
Here you go, miss.

1831
02:09:42,483 --> 02:09:43,900
Rest room break, boss?

1832
02:09:49,991 --> 02:09:54,244
You don't need to ask me every time you need
to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

1833
02:09:55,496 --> 02:09:57,122
Yes, sir.

1834
02:10:07,216 --> 02:10:10,218
RED: 40 years
I've been asking permission to piss.

1835
02:10:11,262 --> 02:10:13,430
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1836
02:10:17,602 --> 02:10:19,644
There's a harsh truth to face.

1837
02:10:21,647 --> 02:10:23,940
No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.

1838
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:35,619
All I do any more
is think of ways to break my parole...

1839
02:10:36,704 --> 02:10:38,747
..so maybe they'd send me back.

1840
02:10:44,295 --> 02:10:46,338
A terrible thing to live in fear.

1841
02:10:47,757 --> 02:10:51,092
Brooks Hatlen knew it, knew it all too well.

1842
02:10:53,304 --> 02:10:56,056
All I want is to be back
where things make sense,

1843
02:10:57,141 --> 02:10:59,601
where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

1844
02:11:02,522 --> 02:11:04,564
Only one thing stops me.

1845
02:11:05,650 --> 02:11:07,692
A promise I made to Andy.

1846
02:11:28,464 --> 02:11:30,507
Here it is.

1847
02:11:40,351 --> 02:11:42,394
Much obliged, sir.

1848
02:15:05,681 --> 02:15:07,724
(Bird calls)

1849
02:15:21,238 --> 02:15:22,530
ANDY: Dear Red,

1850
02:15:22,615 --> 02:15:25,074
if you're reading this, you've gotten out.

1851
02:15:25,159 --> 02:15:29,412
And if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to come a little further.

1852
02:15:29,497 --> 02:15:32,040
You remember the name of the town, don't you?

1853
02:15:34,418 --> 02:15:36,461
Zihuatanejo.

1854
02:15:37,546 --> 02:15:38,713
I could use a good man

1855
02:15:38,798 --> 02:15:40,840
to help me get my project on wheels.

1856
02:15:40,925 --> 02:15:43,051
I'll keep an eye out for you

1857
02:15:43,135 --> 02:15:45,136
and the chessboard ready.

1858
02:15:46,222 --> 02:15:47,597
Remember, Red,

1859
02:15:47,681 --> 02:15:49,724
hope is a good thing.

1860
02:15:49,809 --> 02:15:51,851
Maybe the best of things.

1861
02:15:51,936 --> 02:15:53,978
And no good thing ever dies.

1862
02:15:55,064 --> 02:15:57,524
I will be hoping that this letter finds you

1863
02:15:57,608 --> 02:15:59,651
and finds you well.

1864
02:15:59,735 --> 02:16:02,195
Your friend, Andy.

1865
02:16:36,814 --> 02:16:40,650
RED: Get busy living or get busy dying.

1866
02:16:43,237 --> 02:16:45,280
That's goddamn right.

1867
02:16:50,786 --> 02:16:52,912
For the second time in my life,

1868
02:16:52,997 --> 02:16:55,039
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1869
02:16:56,750 --> 02:16:58,793
Parole violation.

1870
02:16:58,878 --> 02:17:02,505
Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1871
02:17:03,799 --> 02:17:05,842
Not for an old crook like me.

1872
02:17:05,926 --> 02:17:07,969
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1873
02:17:11,724 --> 02:17:15,810
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still
or hold a thought in my head.

1874
02:17:16,896 --> 02:17:19,898
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1875
02:17:19,982 --> 02:17:22,692
A free man at the start of a long journey

1876
02:17:22,776 --> 02:17:25,653
whose conclusion is uncertain.

1877
02:17:28,574 --> 02:17:30,700
I hope I can make it across the border.

1878
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:35,371
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

1879
02:17:37,791 --> 02:17:40,960
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1880
02:17:43,756 --> 02:17:45,590
I hope.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
