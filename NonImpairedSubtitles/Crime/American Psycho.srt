1
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,755
Our pasta this evening is
squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...

2
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,675
...with goat cheese profiteroles.
And I also have an arugula Caesar salad.

3
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,911
For entrees, I have swordfish meatloaf
with onion marmalade.

4
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,470
Rare roasted partridge breast
in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale.

5
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,518
And grilled free range rabbit
with herb french fries.

6
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,156
Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth....

7
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,758
God, I hate this place.
It's a chick's restaurant.

8
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,869
Why not Dorsia?

9
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,520
Because Bateman won't give
the maître d' head.

10
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,833
Is that Reed Robinson?

11
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,559
-You freebasing? That's not Robinson.
-Who is it then?

12
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,108
-That's Paul Allen.
-That's not Paul Allen.

13
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,318
-Paul Allen's on the other side of the room.
-Who's he with?

14
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,072
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

15
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,957
Can't do coke in this bathroom.

16
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,508
-Are you sure that's Paul Allen?
-Yes, McDufus.

17
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,238
He handles the Fisher account.

18
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,356
-Lucky bastard.
-Lucky Jew bastard.

19
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,755
What does that have to do with anything?

20
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,071
I've seen that bastard in his office
on the phone with CEO's...

21
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,755
-...spinning a fucking menorah.
-Not a menorah. You spin a dreidel.

22
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,628
Oh, my God, do you want me to fry you up
some fucking potato pancakes?

23
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,676
-Some latkes?
-No. Just...

24
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,476
...cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.

25
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,472
I forgot. Bateman's dating someone
from the ACLU.

26
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,040
The voice of reason. The boy next door.

27
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,192
Speaking of reasonable...

28
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,714
...only $570.

29
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,749
Not bad.

30
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,431
Two Stoli on the rocks.

31
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,233
These aren't good any more.
It's a cash bar.

32
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,358
That will be $25.

33
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,316
You're a fucking ugly bitch.

34
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,435
I want to stab you to death
and play around with your blood.

35
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,511
I live in the American Gardens Building
on West 81st Street...

36
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,113
...on the 11th floor.

37
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,311
My name is Patrick Bateman.
I'm 27 years old.

38
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,470
I believe in taking care of myself...

39
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,751
...in a balanced diet
and a rigorous exercise routine.

40
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,315
In the morning, if my face is a little puffy...

41
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,597
...I'll put on an ice pack
while doing my stomach crunches.

42
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,113
I can do 1,000 now.

43
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,509
After I remove the ice pack,
I use a deep pore cleanser lotion.

44
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,396
In the shower,
I use a water-activated gel cleanser...

45
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,590
...then, a honey-almond body scrub...

46
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,878
...and on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub.

47
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,795
Then, I apply a herb mint facial mask...

48
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,919
...which I leave on for 10 minutes,
while I prepare the rest of my routine.

49
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,034
I always use an aftershave lotion
with little or no alcohol...

50
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,670
...because alcohol dries your face out
and makes you look older...

51
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,439
...then, moisturizer...

52
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,631
...then, an anti-ageing eye balm...

53
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,678
...followed by
a final moisturizing protective lotion.

54
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,754
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman...

55
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,149
...some kind of abstraction,
but there is no real me...

56
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,108
...only an entity, something illusory.

57
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,035
And though I can hide my cold gaze...

58
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,032
...and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh gripping yours...

59
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,954
...and maybe you can even sense
our lifestyles are probably comparable...

60
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,798
...I simply am not there.

61
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,717
Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.

62
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,238
-Late?
-Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?

63
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,870
Ricky Harrison cancelled. He didn't say
what he was canceling or why.

64
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,236
I occasionally box with Ricky
at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?

65
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,880
Spencer wants to meet for drinks
at Fluties Pier 17.

66
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,359
-When?
-After 6:00.

67
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,714
Negative. Cancel it.

68
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,030
-And what should I say?
-Just say no.

69
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,429
Just say no?

70
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,435
Okay, Jean.

71
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,468
I need reservations for three at Camols...

72
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,477
...at 12:30 and if not, try Crayons.

73
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,039
-All right?
-Yes sir.

74
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,634
Wait. And I need reservations for two...

75
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,069
...at Arcadia at 8:00 on Thursday.

76
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,673
Something romantic?

77
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,829
No.

78
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,629
Silly.

79
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,469
-Forget it. I'll make them.
-No, I'll do it.

80
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,632
No. Be a doll and just get me
a mineral water, okay?

81
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,798
-You look nice today.
-Don't wear that outfit again.

82
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,359
What? I didn't hear you.

83
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,908
I said, "Do not wear that outfit again."

84
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,150
Wear a dress. A skirt or something.

85
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,989
-You don't like this, I take it?
-Come on...

86
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,957
...you're prettier than that.

87
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,559
Thanks, Patrick.

88
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,560
I'm not here. And high heels.

89
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,513
I like high heels.

90
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,716
Hundreds, thousands of roses.

91
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,351
And lots of chocolate truffles. Godiva.
And oysters on the half shell.

92
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,874
I'm listening
to the new Robert Palmer tape...

93
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,157
...but Evelyn, my supposed fiancée,
keeps buzzing in my ear.

94
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,434
Photographers.

95
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,314
Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz.

96
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,274
And we'll have to get someone
to videotape it.

97
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,551
Patrick, we should do it.

98
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,199
Do what?

99
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,233
-Get married.
-No. I can't take the time off work.

100
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,198
Your father owns the company.
You can do anything, silly.

101
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,158
-I don't want to talk about it.
-You hate that job anyway.

102
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,117
I don't see why you just don't quit.

103
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,636
Because I want to fit in.

104
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,194
Williams' party.

105
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,597
I'm on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at Espace...

106
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,592
...since I'm positive
we won't have a decent table.

107
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,869
But we do.

108
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,317
And relief washes over me
in an awesome wave.

109
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,792
This is my cousin,
Vanden, and her boyfriend, Stash.

110
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,954
-They're both artists.
-The menu is in braille.

111
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,748
I'm fairly certain that Timothy Bryce
and Evelyn are having an affair.

112
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,074
Timothy is the only interesting person
I know.

113
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,590
I'm almost completely indifferent
as to whether Evelyn knows...

114
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,513
...I'm having an affair
with Courtney Rawlinson...

115
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,598
...her closest friend.

116
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,956
Courtney is almost perfect looking.

117
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,953
She usually operates
on one or more psychiatric drugs.

118
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,951
Tonight, I believe it's Xanax.

119
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,270
More disturbing than her drug use,
though...

120
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,193
...is the fact that she's engaged
to Luis Carruthers.

121
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,517
-The biggest dufus in the business.
-Tell me, Stash...

122
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,551
...do you think Soho is becoming
too commercial?

123
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,278
Yes, I read that.

124
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,958
Who gives a rat's ass?

125
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,354
That affects us.

126
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,549
What about the massacres
in Sri Lanka, honey?

127
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,757
Doesn't that affect us too?
Do you know anything about Sri Lanka?

128
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,149
The Sikhs are killing tons of Israelis.

129
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,074
Come on, Bryce. There are a lot more
important problems than Sri Lanka...

130
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,752
-...to worry about.
-Like what?

131
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,149
We have to end apartheid for one.

132
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,989
And slow down the nuclear arms race.

133
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,674
Stop terrorism and world hunger.

134
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,270
We have to provide food and shelter
for the homeless.

135
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,229
And oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights...

136
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,119
...while also promoting equal rights
for women.

137
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,556
We have to encourage a return...

138
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,918
...to traditional, moral values.

139
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,678
Most importantly, we have to promote
general social concern.

140
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,190
And less materialism in young people.

141
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,149
Patrick...

142
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,952
...how thought provoking.

143
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,789
Hello.

144
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,829
Hello.

145
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,639
Bleaching? Are you trying
to say bleaching? Oh, my God.

146
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,917
Two things. One. You can't bleach
a Cerruti. Out of the question.

147
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,355
Two. I can only get these sheets
in Santa Fe.

148
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,079
These are very expensive sheets
and I need them clean.

149
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,072
If you don't shut your fucking mouth,
I will kill you.

150
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,632
I'm having lunch at Hubert's
in 20 minutes with Ronald Harrison.

151
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,679
I need those sheets cleaned this afternoon.
Listen, I cannot understand you!

152
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,354
This is crazy. You're a fool.
I can't cope with this.

153
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,237
Stupid bleaching! Understand!

154
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,349
Patrick?

155
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,031
-Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
-Hello.

156
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,316
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way
up here, but they're the best.

157
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,356
Then why can't they get the stains out?

158
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,194
I mean, can you talk to these people
or something? I'm not getting anywhere.

159
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,508
What are those?

160
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,476
It's cranberry juice. Cranapple.

161
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,549
Really?

162
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,996
If you could talk to them,
I'd really appreciate it. I'm really late.

163
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,039
-I have to be at Hubert's in 15 minutes.
-Hubert's? That moved uptown, right?

164
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,793
Well, boy, I've got to go.
Thank you, Victoria.

165
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,672
Maybe we could do lunch next week?

166
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,432
-I'm downtown at--
-I don't know.

167
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,318
-I'm at work all the time.
-What about a Saturday?

168
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,193
-Next Saturday?
-Sure.

169
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,032
Can't, I've matinee of Les Mis.

170
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,237
-I've really got to go. Christ! I'll call you.
-Okay.

171
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,749
Do.

172
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,956
You're dating Luis. He's in Arizona.
You're fucking me.

173
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,873
We haven't made plans.
What could you be up to tonight?

174
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,349
-Stop it. I'm....
-On a lot of lithium?

175
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,751
Waiting for Luis to call me.
He said he'd call tonight.

176
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,109
Pumpkin?

177
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,319
You're dating an asshole.

178
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,032
Pumpkin, you're dating
the biggest dickweed in New York.

179
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,916
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling,
tumbling dickweed.

180
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,152
Patrick, stop calling me Pumpkin, okay?

181
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,235
I have to go.

182
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,390
Courtney? Dinner?

183
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,829
I can't.

184
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,439
I'm thinking Dorsia.

185
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,989
Dorsia's nice.

186
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,718
Wear something fabulous.

187
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,958
-Dorsia.
-Yes.

188
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,273
I know it's late, but is it possible to reserve
a table for two at 8:00 or 8:30 perhaps?

189
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,469
A facial at Elizabeth Arden,
which was really relaxing...

190
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,716
...and then to the Pottery Barn...

191
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,557
...where I got this little silver muffin dish.

192
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,918
-Is that Donald Trump's car?
-Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.

193
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,514
You should take more lithium
or have a Diet Coke.

194
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,194
Some caffeine might get you
out of this slump.

195
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,312
I just want a child.

196
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,552
Just two perfect...

197
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,469
...children.

198
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,550
-Are we here?
-Yeah.

199
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,833
This is Dorsia?

200
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,149
Yes, dear.

201
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,794
You're gonna have the peanut butter soup
with smoked duck and mashed squash.

202
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,589
New York Matinée called it,
"a playful but mysterious little dish."

203
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,908
You'll love it.

204
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,952
And then the red snapper
with violets and pine nuts.

205
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,951
I think that'll follow nicely.

206
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,279
Thanks, Patrick.

207
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,116
Patrick, thanks so much
for looking after Courtney.

208
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,111
Dorsia, how impressive!

209
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,630
How on earth did you get a reservation?

210
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,948
Lucky, I guess.

211
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,152
That's a wonderful suit.

212
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,071
Don't tell me, let me guess.

213
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,153
Valentino Couture?

214
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,673
It looks so soft.

215
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,150
Your compliment was sufficient, Luis.

216
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,794
Hello, Halberstram. Nice tie.

217
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,714
How the hell are you?

218
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,997
Allen has mistaken me for this dickhead,
Marcus Halberstram.

219
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,913
It seems logical because
Marcus also works at P & P...

220
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,991
...and does the same exact thing I do.

221
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,959
He also has a penchant for Valentino suits
and Oliver People's glasses.

222
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,789
We even go to the same barber,
although I have a slightly better haircut.

223
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,791
So how's the Ransom account going?

224
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,111
-It's all right.
-Really? That's interesting. It's not...

225
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,839
-...great?
-Well, you know.

226
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,356
-So how's Cecelia? She's a great girl.
-Yeah.

227
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,630
-I'm very lucky.
-Hey, Allen!

228
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,071
-Congratulations on the Fisher account.
-Thank you, Baxter.

229
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,713
Paul. Squash?

230
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,309
Call me.

231
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,917
-How about Friday?
-No can do.

232
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,795
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.

233
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,714
Great sea urchin ceviche.

234
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,914
Dorsia on a Friday night?
How'd he swing that?

235
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,433
I think he's lying.

236
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,308
Is that a gram?

237
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,117
New card. What do you think?

238
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,389
Very nice.

239
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,035
Look at that.

240
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,997
Picked them up yesterday.

241
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,911
-Good coloring.
-That's bone.

242
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,839
And the lettering is something
called Silian Rail.

243
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,195
It's very cool, Bateman. But that's nothing.

244
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,352
-Look at this.
-That is really nice.

245
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,630
Eggshell with Romalian type.

246
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,999
What do you think?

247
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,789
Nice.

248
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,315
Jesus. That is really super.

249
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,789
How'd a nitwit like you get so tasteful?

250
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,159
I can't believe that Bryce prefers
Van Patten's card to mine.

251
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,472
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

252
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,799
Raised lettering, Pale Nimbus.

253
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,709
White.

254
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,076
Impressive. Very nice.

255
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,591
Let's see Paul Allen's card.

256
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,469
Look at that subtle off-white coloring.

257
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,637
The tasteful thickness of it.

258
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,832
Oh, my God, it even has a watermark.

259
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,910
Is something wrong?
Patrick? You're sweating.

260
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,554
Hello. Pat Bateman.

261
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,957
You want some money?

262
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,709
Some food?

263
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,396
-Is this what you need?
-I'm hungry.

264
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,550
Yeah, it's cold out too, isn't it?

265
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,319
Why don't you get a job?

266
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,597
-lf you're so hungry, why not get a job?
-I lost my job.

267
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,316
Why? You're drinking?

268
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,598
Is that why you lost it?

269
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,239
Insider trading?

270
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,349
Just joking.

271
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,194
What's your name?

272
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,271
-Al.
-Speak up! Come on.

273
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,319
-Al.
-Get a goddamn job, Al.

274
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,152
You've got a negative attitude.

275
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,277
That's what's stopping you.
You've got to get your act together.

276
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,554
I'll help you.

277
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,679
You are so kind, mister. You're kind.

278
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,796
-You're a kind man.
-It's okay.

279
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,516
Please, you got to tell me what to do.
You got to help me. I'm so cold.

280
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,948
I'm hungry.

281
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,869
Do you know how bad you smell?
You reek of shit. Do you know that?

282
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,435
I'm sorry.

283
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,439
It's just that....

284
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,994
I don't know.

285
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,154
I don't have anything in common with you.

286
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,351
Thank you, mister. Thank you.

287
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,239
I'm cold out here.

288
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,949
Do you know what a fucking loser you are?

289
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,074
What beautiful skin you have,
Mr. Bateman.

290
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,195
So fine. So smooth.

291
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,479
I have all the characteristics
of a human being:

292
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,154
Flesh, blood, skin, hair.

293
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,633
But not a single clear,
identifiable emotion...

294
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,315
...except for greed and disgust.

295
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,434
Something horrible is happening
inside of me.

296
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,033
And I don't know why.

297
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,232
My nightly bloodlust has overflowed
into my days.

298
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,838
I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy.

299
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,079
I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.

300
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,748
Hey, McCloy, what do you say?

301
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,791
Hamilton, have a holly jolly Christmas.
Is Allen still handling the Fisher account?

302
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,634
-Of course, who else?
-Mistletoe alert!

303
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,356
Merry Xmas, Patrick! Merry Xmas, Harry!

304
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,351
-Merry Christmas.
-You're late, honey.

305
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,919
-No.
-Yes, you are.

306
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,674
I've been here the entire time.
You just didn't see me.

307
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,514
Say hello to Snowball. Snowball says,
"Merry Christmas, Patrick."

308
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,237
-What is it?
-It's a little baby piggy-wiggy, isn't it?

309
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,951
It's a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig.
They make darling pets. Don't you?

310
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,960
Stop scowling, Patrick.
You're such a Grinch.

311
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,073
What's Mr. Grinch want for Christmas?
And don't say breast implants again.

312
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,273
-Allen!
-Marcus!

313
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,831
Merry Christmas! How have you been?
Workaholic, I suppose.

314
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,717
Haven't seen you in a while.

315
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,997
Hamilton, we're going to Nell's.
Limo's out front.

316
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,473
-We should have dinner.
-Maybe you could bring....

317
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,035
-Cecelia?
-Yes, Cecelia.

318
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,315
Cecelia would adore it.

319
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,356
Well then, let's do it, Marcus.

320
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,278
-Great party.
-Thanks.

321
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,995
Patrick, why is he calling you Marcus?

322
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,233
Mistletoe alert!

323
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,675
Marcus Halberstram for two at 7:00.

324
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,994
No, I want to know....

325
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,799
Okay, I came here
for the cilantro fish gumbo, all right?

326
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,190
It's the only excuse one could have
for being here, which is...

327
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,316
...by the way, almost completely empty.

328
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,358
-I'm very sorry, sir.
-J & B straight and a Corona.

329
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,080
-Would you like to--
-Double Absolut martini!

330
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,429
Yes, sir.

331
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,679
-Would you like to hear the specials?
-Not if you want to keep your spleen.

332
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,594
This is a real beehive of activity,
Halberstram.

333
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,750
This place is hot, very hot.

334
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,755
The mud soup and the charcoal arugula
are outrageous here.

335
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,592
Yeah, well, you're late.

336
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,474
I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break.

337
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,760
I see they've omitted the pork loin
with lime Jell-O.

338
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,478
We should've gone to Dorsia.

339
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,757
-I could've gotten us a table.
-Nobody goes there anymore.

340
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,592
Is that lvana Trump?

341
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,038
Jeez, Patrick. I mean Marcus.
What are you thinking?

342
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,949
Why would lvana be at Texarkana?

343
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,714
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling
the Fisher account?

344
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,399
How'd you get it?

345
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,710
I could tell you that, Halberstram...

346
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,550
...but then I'd have to kill you.

347
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,831
I like to dissect girls.
Did you know I'm utterly insane?

348
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,875
Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive.

349
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,757
-Where do you tan?
-Salon.

350
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,877
I've got a tanning bed at home.
You should look into it.

351
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,037
And Cecelia? How is she?

352
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,996
-Where is she tonight?
-Well, you know Cecelia....

353
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,231
I think she's having dinner
with Evelyn Williams.

354
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,469
Evelyn?

355
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,109
Great ass. Goes out with that loser,
Patrick Bateman. What a dork!

356
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,949
Another martini, Paul?

357
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,270
You like Huey Lewis & the News?

358
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,314
They're okay.

359
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,594
Their early work was
a little too New Wave for my taste.

360
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,434
But when Sports came out in '83...

361
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,633
...I think they really came into their own,
commercially and artistically.

362
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,074
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound...

363
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,720
...and a new sheen
of consummate professionalism...

364
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,360
...that really gives the songs a big boost.

365
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,071
He's been compared to Elvis Costello.

366
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,630
But I think Huey has a far more bitter,
cynical sense of humor.

367
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,511
-Hey, Halberstram?
-Yes, Allen?

368
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,236
Why are there copies of the Style section
all over the place?

369
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,477
Do you have a dog?
A little chow or something?

370
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,395
No, Allen.

371
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,948
-Is that a raincoat?
-Yes, it is.

372
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,838
In 1987, Huey released this,
Four, their most accomplished album.

373
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,117
I think their undisputed masterpiece is
Hip To Be Square.

374
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,556
A song so catchy that most people
probably don't listen to the lyrics.

375
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,155
But they should because it's not just
about the pleasures of conformity...

376
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,677
...and the importance of trends. It's also
a personal statement about the band itself.

377
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,869
Hey, Paul!

378
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,115
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now,
you fucking stupid bastard!

379
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,592
Patrick? Patrick?

380
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,712
-Is that you?
-No, Luis. It's not me.

381
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,869
You're mistaken.

382
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,520
This is my very good friend,
Patrick Bateman.

383
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,955
Where are you going?
We're going to Nell's.

384
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,031
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.

385
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,630
Where did you get that overnight bag?

386
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,919
Jean Paul Gaultier.

387
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,115
When I get to Paul Allen's place,
I use the keys I took from his pocket...

388
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,997
...before disposing of the body.

389
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,629
There is a moment of sheer panic...

390
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,510
...when I realize that Paul's apartment
overlooks the park.

391
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,874
And is obviously more expensive
than mine.

392
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,913
I calm myself,
and move into the bedroom...

393
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,839
...where I find his suitcase and
start to pack.

394
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,914
It's time for Paul to take a little trip.

395
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,952
Where to send the bastard?

396
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,549
Dallas?

397
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,150
Paris? Singapore? London?
I'll send the asshole to London.

398
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,277
Hi, this is Paul.
I've been called to London for a few days.

399
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,875
Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.
Hasta la vista, baby.

400
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,915
What is it?

401
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,718
Patrick, it's just....

402
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,075
Yes, Jean?

403
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,160
-Mr. Donald Kimball is here to see you.
-Who?

404
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,672
Detective Donald Kimball?

405
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,878
Tell him I'm at lunch.

406
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,517
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows you're here.

407
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,793
Send him in, I guess.

408
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,995
Now John, you've got to wear clothes
in proportion to your physique.

409
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,908
There are definite do's and don'ts,
good buddy, of wearing a bold stripe shirt.

410
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,869
A bold striped shirt calls for solid colored
or discreetly patterned suits and ties.

411
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,918
Yes, always tip the stylist 15%.

412
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,950
Listen John, I've got to go.
T. Bone Pickens just walked in.

413
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,189
Just joking.

414
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,870
No, don't tip the owner of the salon.

415
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,834
Okay John, right, got it.

416
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,469
Sorry.

417
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,989
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.

418
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,036
Was that anything important?

419
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,634
That? Just mulling
over business problems.

420
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,593
Examining opportunities.
Exchanging rumors.

421
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,513
Spreading gossip.

422
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,950
Hi. I'm Donald Kimball.

423
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,469
-Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
-Sorry to barge in on you like this.

424
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,630
I know how busy you guys can get.

425
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,036
So, what's the...

426
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,636
-...topic of discussion?
-I've been hired by Meredith Powell...

427
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,798
...to investigate the disappearance
of Paul Allen.

428
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,588
I see, Paul's disappearance, yeah.

429
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,432
It's nothing that official.

430
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,273
I just have some basic questions
about Paul and yourself.

431
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,873
-Coffee?
-No, I'm okay.

432
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,952
-Apollinaris?
-No, I'm okay.

433
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,956
-Can you bring Mr....
-Kimball.

434
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,156
-A bottle of--
-No, really, I'm okay.

435
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,559
It's no problem.

436
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,276
So, what's the topic of discussion?

437
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,229
Disappearance of Paul Allen.

438
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,755
Right. Well, l....

439
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,669
I haven't heard anything
about the disappearance or anything.

440
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,677
Not on page six, at least.

441
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,798
-His family wants this kept quiet.
-Understandable.

442
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,836
-Lime?
-No, really. I'm okay.

443
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,433
Sure? I can get you a lime.

444
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,069
Just some preliminary questions
that I need for my own files, okay?

445
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,149
Shoot.

446
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,791
-How old are you?
-27.

447
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,156
-Where did you go to school?
-Harvard. The Harvard Business School.

448
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,309
Your address?

449
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,755
American Gardens Building,
West 81st Street.

450
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,193
Nice. Very nice.

451
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,509
Thanks.

452
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,997
-What can you tell me about Paul Allen?
-I'm at a loss.

453
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,988
-He was part of that whole Yale thing.
-Yale thing?

454
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,479
Yeah. Yale thing.

455
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,908
What do you mean?

456
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,754
Well, I think for one that
he was probably a closet homosexual...

457
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,832
...who did a lot of cocaine. That Yale thing.

458
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,954
What kind of a man was he? Besides
the information you've just given me?

459
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,476
-I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
-Do you feel like that?

460
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,879
No. Not really.

461
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,198
Where did Paul hang out?

462
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,556
-Hang out?
-Yeah. You know, hang out.

463
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,834
Let me think.

464
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,437
The Newport. Harry's. Fluties.

465
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,308
Indochine. Nell's. The Cornell Club.

466
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,675
-The New York Yacht Club.
-He had a yacht?

467
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,070
-No, he just hung out there.
-And where did he go to school?

468
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,191
-Don't you know this?
-I just wanted to know if you know.

469
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,713
Before Yale?
If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's.

470
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,156
Listen, I just want to help.

471
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,794
I understand.

472
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,072
Any witnesses or fingerprints?

473
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,039
There's a message on his answering
machine that says he went to London.

474
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,509
-Maybe he did.
-His girlfriend doesn't think so.

475
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,034
-Has anyone seen him in London?
-Actually, yes.

476
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,994
But I've had difficulty getting
an actual verification.

477
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,390
A Stephen Hughes said he saw him
at a restaurant there.

478
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,632
But I checked it out and what happened is,
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth for Paul.

479
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,871
-Had his apartment been burglarized?
-No, actually it hadn't.

480
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,715
Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone.
So was some luggage. That's it.

481
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,950
Anyone dealing with the homicide squad?

482
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,156
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure.

483
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,754
Basically, no one's seen or heard anything.

484
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,678
-So typical, isn't it?
-It's just strange.

485
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,872
One day someone's walking around,
going to work...

486
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,391
-...alive, and then....
-Nothing.

487
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,318
People just disappear.

488
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,197
The earth just opens up
and swallows them.

489
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,795
Eerie. Really eerie.

490
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,958
You'll have to excuse me.
I have a meeting with Cliff Huxtable...

491
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,270
...at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes.

492
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,432
The Four Seasons?
Isn't that a little far uptown?

493
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,670
Aren't you going to be late?

494
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,318
No. There's one down here.

495
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,868
-Really? I didn't know that.
-Yes, it's very good.

496
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,555
Listen, if anything occurs to you,
any information--

497
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,437
Absolutely, I'm 1 00% with you.

498
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,991
Great. And thanks for your time,
Mr. Bateman.

499
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,999
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

500
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,996
-I haven't seen you around here.
-You just haven't been looking.

501
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,196
Would you like to see my apartment?

502
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,238
I'm not supposed to.

503
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,588
Do you want to come
to my apartment or not?

504
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,554
I'm not supposed to,
but I can make an exception.

505
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,278
Do you take a credit card?

506
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,474
I'm joking. Come on, get in.

507
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,631
I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde,
who does couples.

508
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,269
Couples. I really can't stress
blonde enough.

509
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,509
Blonde.

510
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,594
I'm Paul. My name is Paul Allen.
You got that?

511
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,154
You're Christie.

512
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,390
You are to respond only to Christie.

513
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,954
Is that clear?

514
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,394
It's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking.

515
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,751
I want you to clean your vagina.

516
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,432
No, from behind.

517
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,479
Get on your knees.

518
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,837
You have a very nice body.

519
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,598
Thank you. Send her up.

520
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,993
Christie, get out and dry off, choose a robe.

521
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,794
Not the Bijan.

522
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,078
Then, come and meet me and our guest
in the living room for drinks.

523
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,551
You've arrived! How lovely.

524
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,713
Let me take your coat. I'm Paul.
How good of you to come.

525
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,798
Not quite blonde, are you?

526
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,719
More dirty blonde.

527
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,431
I'm going to call you Sabrina.

528
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,228
I'm Paul Allen.

529
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,269
So...

530
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,270
...don't you want to know what I do?

531
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,549
No.

532
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,988
No, not really.

533
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,593
Well, I work on Wall Street.

534
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,279
At Pierce & Pierce.

535
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,193
Have you heard of it?

536
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,469
You have a really nice place here, Paul.

537
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,351
How much did you pay for it?

538
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,836
Well actually, that's none of your business.

539
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,479
But I can assure you,
it certainly wasn't cheap.

540
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,036
No. No smoking. Not in here.

541
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,154
Varda Truffle?

542
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,910
I don't want you to get drunk, but...

543
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,432
...that's a very fine Chardonnay
you're not drinking.

544
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,752
Do you like Phil Collins?

545
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,472
I've been a big Genesis fan ever since
the release of their 1980 album...

546
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,869
...Duke.

547
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,873
Before that I really didn't understand
any of their work.

548
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,988
It's too artsy, too intellectual.

549
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,548
It was on Duke, where Phil Collins'
presence became more apparent.

550
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,637
I think Invisible Touch is
the group's undisputed masterpiece.

551
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,910
It's an epic meditation on intangibility.

552
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,514
At the same time,
it deepens and enriches...

553
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,320
...the meaning
of the preceding three albums.

554
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,794
Christie, take off the robe.

555
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,878
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing
of Banks, Collins, and Rutherford.

556
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,597
You can practically hear every nuance
of every instrument.

557
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,276
Sabrina, remove your dress.

558
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,590
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer song writing...

559
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,753
...this album hits a new peak
of professionalism.

560
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,275
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?

561
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,630
Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion...

562
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:32,029
...in this song, Phil Collins addresses
the problems of abusive political authority.

563
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,672
In Too Deep is the most moving pop song
of the 1980s...

564
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,520
...about monogamy and commitment.

565
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,751
The song is extremely uplifting.

566
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,276
Their lyrics are
as positive and affirmative...

567
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,838
...as anything I've heard in rock.

568
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,799
Christie, get down on your knees,
so Sabrina can see your asshole.

569
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,111
Phil Collins' solo career...

570
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,590
...seems to be more commercial...

571
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,951
...and therefore,
more satisfying in a narrower way...

572
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,792
...especially songs like In the Air Tonight
and Against All Odds.

573
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,194
Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.

574
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,276
I also think that Phil Collins works best
within the confines of the group...

575
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,319
...than as a solo artist.

576
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,073
And I stress the word "artist."

577
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,517
This is Sussudio, a great, great song.

578
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,839
A personal favorite.

579
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,758
Don't touch the watch.

580
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,509
Can we go now?

581
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,838
We're not through yet.

582
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,069
If they have a good personality
and aren't great looking, then who cares?

583
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,914
Let's say hypothetically, okay?
What if they have a good personality?

584
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,874
I know, I know.

585
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,474
"There are no girls
with good personalities."

586
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,438
A good personality consists
of a chick with a hard body...

587
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,717
...who'll satisfy all sexual demands
without being too slutty...

588
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,109
...and who'll keep her dumb,
fucking mouth shut.

589
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,509
The only girls with good personalities,
smart...

590
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,160
...funny, halfway intelligent, or talented...

591
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,630
...though God knows what the fuck
that means, are ugly chicks.

592
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,071
This is because they have to make up
for how fucking ugly they are.

593
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,232
-You know what Ed Gein said?
-Ed Gein? Maître d' at Canal Bar?

594
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,790
-No. Serial killer, Wisconsin in the '50s.
-And what did Ed say?

595
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,792
"When I see a pretty girl,
I think of two things...

596
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,996
"...one part of me wants to take her out...

597
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,152
"...talk to her, be real nice and sweet
and treat her right."

598
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,310
What did the other part of him think?

599
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,834
What her head would look like on a stick.

600
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,796
Hi, guys. I want to get your opinion
on something.

601
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,438
It's my business card.

602
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,316
I decided to get a new one, too.

603
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,319
Very nice, Luis.

604
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,589
Thank you.

605
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,634
What about dinner?

606
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,315
Is that all you ever have to contribute?
What about fucking dinner?

607
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,073
Cheer up there. What's the matter?
No shiatsu today?

608
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,310
Touch me again
and you'll draw back a stump.

609
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,595
-Hold on there, little buddy.
-Excuse me.

610
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,028
Patrick, why here?

611
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,111
I've seen you looking at me.

612
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,956
I've noticed your...

613
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,069
...hot body.

614
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,754
Don't be shy.

615
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,990
You can't imagine how long I've wanted
this, ever since that party at Arizona 206.

616
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,868
You know, the one you were wearing that
red striped paisley Armani tie.

617
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,069
I want you.

618
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,079
I want you, too.

619
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,553
-Patrick!
-What is it?

620
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,478
Where are you going?

621
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,470
I've got to return some video tapes.

622
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,672
I'll call you.

623
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,992
I've been wanting to talk with you!
Come in to my office.

624
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,957
Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?

625
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,798
Do you remember where you were
the night of Paul's disappearance?

626
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,030
Which was on December 20?

627
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,354
God, I guess
I was probably returning videotapes.

628
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,709
-I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
-That's not what I've got.

629
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,917
-What?
-That's not the information I've received.

630
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,558
Well, wait.
What information have you received?

631
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,755
Let me see.

632
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,794
-That you were with--
-Well, I could be wrong.

633
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,348
When was the last time you were
with Paul Allen?

634
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,079
We'd gone to a new musical called...

635
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,956
...Oh Africa, Brave Africa.
It was a laugh riot. That was about it.

636
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,396
I think we had dinner at Orso's.
No, Petaluma. No, Orso's.

637
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,558
I hope I've been informative, long day.
I'm a bit scattered.

638
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,392
I'm a little spent now too.

639
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,998
How about lunch in a week or so,
when I've sorted out all this information?

640
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,798
Great, yes, I'd like that.

641
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,639
If you could try and pin down
where you were...

642
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,349
...the night of Allen's disappearance,
it would make my job a lot easier.

643
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,715
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.

644
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,598
Huey Lewis & the News.

645
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,116
Great stuff. I just bought it
on my way here. You heard it?

646
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,629
Never. I mean, I don't really like singers.

647
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,273
Not a big music fan?

648
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,113
No, I like music.

649
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,633
Just, they're....
