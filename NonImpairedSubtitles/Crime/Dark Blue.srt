This Is My Son

166
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,053
Let Me Do It

167
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,496

168
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,294

173
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:18,956
But...

174
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:36,474

His Name Means Success

184
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,141

And Cooperate With Her

186
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:02,059
My Father Won'T Like That

187
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,459
I Hope He Can Change

188

I Think It Is Not A Good Idea

208
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,151
I Think I Have To Ask My Father

209
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:12,163
Do You Know

210
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,160

00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,832
It Can'T Cover You Gun

212
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,876
It Makes You Look Cheap

213
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,173
You Should Forgive My Little Brother

214
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,407
He Is So Little That He Said That

215
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,812
Ok

216
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,317
He Is The Agent Controlling System

217
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:38,322
It Is Ok That My Father Is Not Here

218
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,827
He Is Crazt About These Things

219
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,890

420
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,299
He Can'T Tell Time

421
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:55,305

00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,518
Do You Believe That It Is Useful

442
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,790
Pretend To Be Cool

But Now This Is The Best

462
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:34,771
Everything You Are Wearing

463
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,212
Is All On My Wrist

464
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:50,220

And Similar

466
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,315

Of Course Everybody Has A Chance

471
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:32,191
Except This Little

472
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,128

But It Is Up Dated Anyway

476
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,747
So When You Look At It

477
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,215
I Couldn'T Help Killing It

478

This Is Not Good

483
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,885
But It Is Up Dated

484
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,225
Remember That A Agent Must Be Up Dated

485
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:11,530
You Haven'T The Sign Of Calta

486
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,035

00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:56,806
I Bought It

504
00:37:58,676 --> 00:37:59,665
Yes, There Is A Comment On Cally

505
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:04,681
Maybe I Know That

506
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,483
I Think I Can Change Him

507

It Smells Like A War

552
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,154
Please Connect It

553
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,323

This Is In My Forehead, Trust Me

556
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:50,304
What Should We Look For

At Firstm Find The Island

558
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:56,611
And Then The Island Man

559
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:01,617
They Surely Lost Contact

560
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:04,780

That Disappearing Circle

567
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:22,765
Is...

568
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,568

571
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:29,912
Alll The Power Is Shup Down

572
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,177
Even This Is Out Of Use

573
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,411
What Is That

574
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,919
Let. S Go Out Of Here

575
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,682

00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:42,214
Belis

577
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,558

578
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:48,860
What Is The Next

579
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,230
Is It Ok

580
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,199
Unbelievable

581
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:53,600
Attacked

582
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,367
You Know

583
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,241
Have We Jumped Right

584
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:04,281
This Is Heavy

585
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:04,871

586
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:09,886
Let'S Go

587
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:22,191

00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:26,168
The Space Suit

589
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:31,173
I Think This Is Not Working

590
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:50,554
I Believe That It Is
Because Of The Miscontrol

591
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,495
It Is Strange

592
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:54,963
Hurry Up

593
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:57,899

Great

596
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:09,278
What Should We Do

597
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:23,254
Without It We Are Over

598
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:27,229
I Hopw It Won'T Explode

599
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,128
I Can Even Walk

600
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,598
Wake Up

601
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,364

602
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,769

606
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,378

00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:06,802
Don'T Over Use You Right

618
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,636
It Is Funny To Mention This

619
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,401
What I Am Say Is Out Of Funny

620
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:11,168
Can'T We Have A Nice Talk

621
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:13,038

627
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,411
How About Having Dinner Tonight

628
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:25,682

629
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,815

Yeaterday A Kindergarten Was Attacked

634
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:37,929
Did They Hurt Anybody

635
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:41,061

636
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:41,627

640
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:02,086
The Satillete Have No Signal

641
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:02,921
So You Have To Depend On Yourselves

642
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:05,553
Go To Get The Kids Back

643
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:08,063

00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:12,996

646
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,198
Wait

647
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:19,504
I Know This Is Not The Right Time

648
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:24,513
But You'S Better Dress Up

649
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:35,191

650
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:40,427
You Wait For Me Here

651
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:43,989
I Hope That There Is Something New

652
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,228
Do You Need Some Help

653
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,771
No, We Have Everything

654
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,067
Yes Everything I Can Get I Have It

655
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:55,077
Ok, See You Next Time

656
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,043
I Start To Worry

657
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,607
Junny What Is It? Can We Go Through

658
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:04,210
Are You Joking

659
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,949
I Am Like A Big Bomb

660
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:08,048
It Slows Me

661
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:12,289
I Can'T Even Move

662
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,728
Maybe The Friends Behind Can Help

663
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:17,164
You Think They Can Be More Gentle

664
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,828
I Can'T lmagine It

665
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:24,101
I Think We Will Be There In 5 Minutes

666
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,039
I Don'T Know, Seehow Tender They Are

667
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:27,906
Oh, My God, The Power Is Too Strong

668
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:29,639
I Think It Owuld Be Less Than 5 Minutes

669
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:32,147
It Is Too Heavy

670
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:34,582
It Is A Bad Idea

671
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:36,209
Ok, Let'S Take A Rest

672
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:41,223

674
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:50,560
I Can'T Take It With Me

675
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:53,728
You Can Take Anything Except This Shit

676
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:56,637

683
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:24,366
