1
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:11,711
Oh! Just letting you know,
if we die, I blame you.

2
00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:13,213
I know.
None of this would have happened

3
00:00:13,338 --> 00:00:14,581
if you'd just gone to the movies
like I told you.

4
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:16,817
Yeah, if I'd gone to the movies,
you'd be in jail right now.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,051
Jail is a big improvement
on my current prospect

6
00:00:19,176 --> 00:00:20,686
of soon to be murdered.

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,859
sub by lala123, corrections & re-sync by me
for www.Addic7ed.Com

9
00:00:29,387 --> 00:00:30,663
Oh, hey.

10
00:00:30,788 --> 00:00:31,998
I just heard from the others.
They're gonna stay in D.C.

11
00:00:32,123 --> 00:00:33,667
I know. Parker texted me.

12
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,003
I mean, for the next two days,
leverage consulting is closed.

13
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:41,241
No work, no cases.
How will we pass that time?

14
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:43,744
With murder.

15
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:46,446
Portland film noir festival?

16
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:47,781
I know how you love
a murder mystery.

17
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:48,948
There are five of them.

18
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:50,383
"Mystery street," 1950?

19
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,652
Nobody shows "mystery street."
I mean, it's incredible.

20
00:00:52,777 --> 00:00:55,054
It's the first mainstream movie
that shows forensic science

21
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:56,222
in murder investigations.

22
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,890
The entire plot hinges on this,

23
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:00,059
uh, forensic anthropology
slide show.

24
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:02,294
Unh-unh! Spoilers.

25
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:04,964
What? One ticket?
It's one ticket.

26
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:06,799
Well, darling, I'm sorry.

27
00:01:06,924 --> 00:01:09,635
I can't join you.
My theater is a wreck.

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,070
I've got to sort out
the rehearsal schedule,

29
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:13,139
I've got a guy coming over
to look at the lighting...

30
00:01:13,264 --> 00:01:14,474
Wait, so you're not gonna...
I know.

31
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,276
I'm gonna be slaving away
in a dusty, old theater

32
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:17,410
while you sit back and relax

33
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,747
and watch alcoholic,
repressed insurance cops

34
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:24,117
harassing tragically
misunderstood femme fatales.

35
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:25,543
Mwah.

36
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,922
You're not supposed to root
for the criminals.

37
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,916
Always root
for the home team. Mwah!

38
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,940
Thank you.

39
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:49,442
I'm afraid most of the artwork
has already been sold.

40
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,111
I'm sorry, Miss, um...
Collins. From the London museum of art.

41
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:53,613
No, no, no. You misunderstand.

42
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,281
We're not looking to acquire
any work.

43
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,284
I just want to view
these incredible paintings.

44
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,752
Oh. I know.

45
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:01,421
I've been curating Mr. Gault's
collection here at the house

46
00:02:01,546 --> 00:02:03,090
since I was in grad school.

47
00:02:03,215 --> 00:02:05,259
Jonas made my career.

48
00:02:05,384 --> 00:02:06,961
Seeing this collection
broken up

49
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,696
just weeks
after his death is...

50
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:10,531
I know.
Why would the family do that?

51
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:11,866
Liar!

52
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:14,201
Jonas wanted <i>me</i> to live
in the guest house!

53
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:16,804
He's gone,
and I want you gone, as well.

54
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,073
Come on. I want you out...

55
00:02:18,198 --> 00:02:20,242
His daughter can't cash
the checks fast enough.

56
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:21,576
Bit of a lush, I see.

57
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:23,912
Actually,
that's his fourth ex-wife.

58
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:25,580
His daughter's the one
in the suit.

59
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:28,873
Could you, um, pardon me,
please?

60
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:34,756
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

61
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:37,425
I know this sounds cheesy,
but have I met you before?

62
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,926
Oh, no, I don't think so.

63
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:42,096
Um, lady Covington-Smythe.
Charmed.

64
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:43,397
Woodman Gault.

65
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:46,566
Oh, Jonas' son. Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry to hear of your loss.

66
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:48,135
He was sick for a long time,

67
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,404
but at least we got close
over the last year.

68
00:02:50,529 --> 00:02:53,908
Well, a father and son should
leave nothing unsaid at the end.

69
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:56,578
Ah. Thank you.

70
00:02:56,703 --> 00:02:58,080
Ah, you're very kind.

71
00:02:58,205 --> 00:03:00,082
With the mister
tragically passed,

72
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:02,084
I have little else to do,
madam.

73
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,043
I prefer to serve.

74
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:09,592
That's Paolo, my dad's
manservant for 20 years.

75
00:03:09,717 --> 00:03:12,094
Manservant?  Yeah.

76
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:14,764
Do you know I am sure
I've met you somewhere.

77
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:17,600
Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. I doubt that.

78
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:19,602
Um...

79
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:23,105
Her ladyship dealt with
your father's overseas division.

80
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,276
Huh. Well, I better be, uh...

81
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,568
Of course.

82
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:32,781
You think you're so clever.

83
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:35,116
I deduced your location
at a random event

84
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:37,518
within 100-mile radius
in under 20 minutes.

85
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:38,686
I've had worse mornings.

86
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:40,521
Is this a, um, German Riesling?

87
00:03:40,646 --> 00:03:41,956
New Zealand.

88
00:03:42,081 --> 00:03:44,358
- How did you find me, exactly?
- Why did you lie to me?

89
00:03:44,483 --> 00:03:45,692
Oh, it's just like old times,
isn't it?

90
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:46,994
Me in the dress

91
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,895
and up to my neck
in easy marks and valuable art,

92
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,030
and you show up, all serious.

93
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:52,365
There is a distinct lack
in you telling me

94
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,367
why you lied to me
in that last speech.

95
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:56,135
- Now, why is a grifter and art thief...
- Ex-art thief.

96
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,305
At a high-end art auction?
Asks the insurance cop.

97
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,741
Ex-insurance investigator.
Still stalling.

98
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:05,577
It's a personal thing.
I... I'm a fan of his work.

99
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:08,313
Jonas Gault, the tycoon?

100
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:09,981
The artist, Jean Mettier,

101
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:13,151
the greatest artist
of the French retro school,

102
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:17,889
his brief career tragically cut
short with his death in 1989.

103
00:04:18,014 --> 00:04:19,424
Since that tragedy,

104
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:22,260
Jonas Gault
painstakingly assembled

105
00:04:22,385 --> 00:04:26,464
the single greatest collection
of Mettier in the world.

106
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:28,132
Thanks to his daughter,

107
00:04:28,257 --> 00:04:30,401
Fiona, the new C.E.O.
of Gault instruments,

108
00:04:30,526 --> 00:04:34,405
and the hard work
of the Gault family lawyer,

109
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,909
Mr. Reinhold Shecter,
we can now share this collection

110
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:40,512
with other
discerning art aficionados.

111
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:46,752
There. I'm just a big fan
of Mettier.

112
00:04:46,877 --> 00:04:48,587
Where else could I have seen
so much of his work?

113
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:51,090
That's all.
But the auction's over.

114
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:55,094
And they're just gonna announce
who bought what, so we should...

115
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:57,597
Huh?

116
00:04:57,722 --> 00:04:59,432
That's all? That's all.

117
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:02,769
Of course, that's not all.

118
00:05:02,894 --> 00:05:05,839
What's left is ma mystère.

119
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:08,608
Would those of you who have
purchased a special pass,

120
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:12,479
please join us
in the vault anteroom.

121
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:13,480
Oh, God.

122
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:19,153
Honey, where's your ticket?

123
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,356
I had it. It was in my pocket.

124
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:22,490
Tickets? Here you are.

125
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:24,159
So, ma mystère.

126
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:27,662
Jean Mettier's legendary
first painting,

127
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:30,666
and there are no pictures of it,
no reproductions.

128
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:34,736
It's never been sold
or exhibited.

129
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:38,040
He... he described it once
as his inspiration.

130
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:41,244
He wrote that it belonged
to no one but him.

131
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:44,080
Hmm. And you're here
to steal it?

132
00:05:44,205 --> 00:05:48,417
No, I just... it's personal.

133
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:50,753
You won't give up any
of your secrets still, huh?

134
00:05:50,878 --> 00:05:52,088
How did you find me?

135
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:53,689
My father acquired
the painting

136
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:57,226
after Mettier's death
and honored the artist's wishes.

137
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:59,062
Frankly, I would have put
in a ticket booth

138
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:01,264
and charged admission.

139
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:03,433
But for over 20 years,

140
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:06,603
my father kept ma mystère
locked in this vault,

141
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:10,573
where he and only he would come
down and look at it every day.

142
00:06:10,698 --> 00:06:14,411
And now, our family lawyer,
Mr. Shecter,

143
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:16,246
will open the vault,

144
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:20,674
and you will be the first
to see what inspired a genius.

145
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:31,560
Oh, my God.

146
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:36,732
Ma mystère's been stolen.
Ma mystère's been stolen.

147
00:06:36,857 --> 00:06:39,300
Well, I'll be buggered.

148
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:40,969
A world-famous painting
goes missing.

149
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:42,971
And, oh, look,
there's a world-famous art thief

150
00:06:43,096 --> 00:06:44,306
happens to be on the premises.

151
00:06:44,431 --> 00:06:46,041
Ex-art thief.
And I didn't do anything.

152
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,576
I was standing
right next to you,

153
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:50,245
and I barely believe that.

154
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,747
- But if somebody like...
Hello, Nate.

155
00:06:51,872 --> 00:06:55,340
Sterling.

156
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:03,923
Give us back the painting and
save <i>yourself</i> a lot of bother, Ms...

157
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:05,417
Still going by Developer?

158
00:07:05,656 --> 00:07:07,008
Still a pompous ass?

159
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:08,776
Charming.

160
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:11,278
Sterling... what?

161
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:14,782
You're Interpol.

162
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:17,118
You don't have the authority
to do any of this.

163
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:20,788
Art theft, as you know,
is an $8 billion-a-year business

164
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:23,624
used to fund racketeering
and terrorism.

165
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:26,193
My new department at interpol,
which I created...

166
00:07:26,318 --> 00:07:27,361
Congratulations.

167
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:29,196
We should have sent a card.
We should have.

168
00:07:29,321 --> 00:07:31,699
Intends to choke off
the money at the source.

169
00:07:31,824 --> 00:07:34,535
The Gault collection is
a high-profile target.

170
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,038
And here we have
the most valuable piece

171
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:39,107
in that collection gone missing

172
00:07:39,232 --> 00:07:41,709
and my favorite art thief
on the premises.

173
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:42,877
Ex-art thief.

174
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:45,680
Ex-art thief! Why does nobody
take that seriously?

175
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:47,349
Well, I mean, because...

176
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:48,383
You know, sometimes

177
00:07:48,508 --> 00:07:50,285
a coincidence
is just a coincidence.

178
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,955
Not where Annie Kroy
A.K.A. Felicity Shaw

179
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,792
A.K.A. Indira McCallister A.K.A.
Sophie Devereaux is concerned.

180
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:58,360
Oh, wait. Hold on. Excuse me.

181
00:07:58,485 --> 00:08:00,562
- Indira McCallister? Seriously?
- Hmm? What?

182
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:04,066
How come I don't know that...
I know all of the aliases.

183
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:05,901
Darling, nobody knows
all of them, not even me.

184
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:06,902
Excuse me.

185
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:08,737
Huh? Yeah. Huh?

186
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:09,905
Can we get back on point?

187
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,740
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

188
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:14,810
The painting, ma mystère, valued
at 5 million euro, missing.

189
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:16,145
Oh.

190
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,980
Well, look, I couldn't hide
a cocktail napkin in this dress,

191
00:08:18,105 --> 00:08:19,315
let alone a painting, so...

192
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,317
Which, by the way,
looks just amazing on you.

193
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:24,020
Thank you. I got it in Paris
when we went on that little...

194
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:26,856
Obviously,
you don't have it on you

195
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:28,692
and you didn't have time
to get it off the grounds.

196
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:30,594
So, where is it?

197
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,128
Sterling,
the thing about it is,

198
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:35,131
is that you don't have evidence
on either one of us about this.

199
00:08:35,256 --> 00:08:37,567
I mean, I know that must be
very annoying... you're right.

200
00:08:37,692 --> 00:08:39,636
I don't have the proof... yet.

201
00:08:39,761 --> 00:08:42,238
But I can keep you here...
Right here...

202
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:44,574
Until I <i>do</i> get the proof.

203
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:50,780
Oh, hands. Grabby.
They're very grabby.

204
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,283
Sterling, you owe me.
Yes, I do.

205
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,452
That's why I'm bothering
to gather evidence

206
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,054
before I send you
to our secret prison.

207
00:08:58,179 --> 00:08:59,555
Huh? Huh? What?

208
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,515
Agents. What'd he say?

209
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:09,898
I hate that man.

210
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:12,233
I don't know how you were
ever partners with him.

211
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:13,902
Well, he's funny
in his own kind of way.

212
00:09:14,027 --> 00:09:17,305
Oh, yeah. Hilarious.
That crack about secret prison.

213
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,806
Oh, no, he was serious
about that.

214
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:20,074
This is all your fault, Nate.

215
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:21,809
You couldn't just leave
well enough alone.

216
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:23,310
Oh, no, no, no, no.
"I'm Nate Ford.

217
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:25,112
"Something going on
that doesn't involve me.

218
00:09:25,237 --> 00:09:26,370
I can't have <i>that!"</i>

219
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:29,817
"Going on"?

220
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:31,152
What's going on?

221
00:09:31,277 --> 00:09:32,487
If you're gonna use
your sexy voice,

222
00:09:32,612 --> 00:09:34,212
you can take these.

223
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:42,296
You're on his side.
You think I stole it.

224
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:44,732
A snatch from a vault
with no exit, no prep?

225
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:46,467
I'd never be such an amateur.

226
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:48,336
Oh, and stealing
would be wrong.

227
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:50,172
Now, the only way we're gonna
get Sterling off your back

228
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:51,506
is to give him the painting.

229
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:53,508
Which, because I did not
steal it, I do not have.

230
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:56,936
Well, then we find out who does,
and we hand him over.

231
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,017
I know that gentleman upstairs
questioning everyone

232
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,853
is interpol.

233
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:05,022
But you're <i>undercover</i> interpol?

234
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,924
Well, of course we are.
Who else would we be?

235
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:08,325
I mean, if we were the thieves,

236
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,661
do you really think
we'd be hanging around here?

237
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:12,397
Of course.

238
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:14,332
Tell us about the security
on the painting.

239
00:10:14,457 --> 00:10:15,834
The keypad
opens the vault door.

240
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,505
Here's also an rfid tag
on ma mystère itself.

241
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,373
Moving the painting
should have triggered the alarm.

242
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:23,842
And is there a way
to deactivate the system?

243
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:26,645
Jonas gave me the code.
I was the only one he trusted.

244
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,847
But I only used it

245
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:30,249
moments before bringing people
down to the vault.

246
00:10:30,374 --> 00:10:31,717
Oh, so we would have
seen someone

247
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:33,052
- trying to steal the painting then.
- Yes.

248
00:10:33,177 --> 00:10:34,420
Now, with the painting gone,

249
00:10:34,545 --> 00:10:36,722
who gets
the insurance settlement?

250
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:38,858
Woodman was disowned years ago,

251
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:40,693
so Fiona and Eleanor
would split it.

252
00:10:40,818 --> 00:10:43,963
I already told
the interpol man upstairs that.

253
00:10:44,088 --> 00:10:45,865
Yes, of course.
Thank you so much.

254
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,166
We'll take it from here.

255
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,601
Yeah. Thank you
for your cooperation.

256
00:10:48,726 --> 00:10:49,903
Thank you so much.
Could you just drop that off?

257
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:52,072
Thank you. Thank you.

258
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:57,511
You do know
that he's going straight up

259
00:10:57,636 --> 00:10:59,347
to talk to Sterling, don't you?

260
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:03,518
This is a two-tiered Glen-Reeder
2700 museum-quality alarm.

261
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:05,887
It would take two days
to crack.

262
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:07,922
Some of the keys are worn.

263
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:10,091
Ah, combination.
Same keys used over and over.

264
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:11,426
Listen, you do know

265
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:13,729
that this isn't about you taking
Sterling's side, don't you?

266
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:16,331
I'm not taking anyone's sides,
especially not Sterling's.

267
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:18,834
Now, listen, he... Shecter...
spilled a drink upstairs,

268
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,869
and his hand
when he just shook it, sticky.

269
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:22,995
Give me the...
give me the works.

270
00:11:24,798 --> 00:11:26,299
Okay.

271
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:31,213
You think I'm lying.

272
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:33,082
Well, you did lie to me.
About the auction.

273
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:35,817
I just thought you'd find
the whole thing rather boring.

274
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:37,552
Yeah, and it turned out to be
a quiet event, didn't it?

275
00:11:37,677 --> 00:11:40,055
Hmm. What do you see?

276
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,656
Someone who can't
turn their brain off.

277
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:45,059
Stop thinking just for a second
and feel. Trust me.

278
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:46,727
No, no. Come here. Look.

279
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:48,562
On the keys, what do you see?

280
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:51,732
Oh. Um... fingerprints.

281
00:11:51,857 --> 00:11:53,601
Yeah. -But not on
the keys that are worn.

282
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:56,103
Yeah, now, you know,
Shecter entered the combination.

283
00:11:56,228 --> 00:11:57,604
It was a different combination

284
00:11:57,729 --> 00:12:00,273
than Jonas Gault had been using
for the last 20 years.

285
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:01,941
Someone changed the code.
Someone changed the code.

286
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,276
Now, Jonas Gault
is the only one

287
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:04,610
who had access
to the combination,

288
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,947
so, clearly, he changed
the combination before he died.

289
00:12:08,072 --> 00:12:10,115
And...

290
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,917
I would so much love
to trust you,

291
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,852
but you make it so hard because
you're still hiding something.

292
00:12:14,977 --> 00:12:17,188
And I know you're just
trying to charm me into,

293
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:18,890
uh, telling you
how I found you.

294
00:12:19,015 --> 00:12:20,625
Mnh-mnh. No.
That's not how it...

295
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,793
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

296
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:23,928
Wait. How <i>did</i> you find me?

297
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:25,663
How did you find me?

298
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:28,800
Nothing's been touched
since Mr. Gault... you know.

299
00:12:28,925 --> 00:12:32,404
I'll always remember the time
he sent me 500 red roses

300
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:35,341
and a troupe of balladeers
for my sweet 16.

301
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:36,842
That was the mister.

302
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:39,444
Romantic heart,
but weak in the end.

303
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:42,781
Thank you so much for allowing
us this time to commune

304
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:47,285
with whatever bits of his spirit
may still be lingering.

305
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,120
Of course.

306
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:51,790
Manservant?

307
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:53,792
Right?

308
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:55,027
What are we looking for?

309
00:12:55,152 --> 00:12:57,963
Glasses are
on the wrong side of the bed.

310
00:12:58,088 --> 00:13:00,466
Huh. Right.
Reading lamp there, books there.

311
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:02,001
What was he reading
on this side?

312
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:03,670
Uh, last job
would be in the buffer.

313
00:13:03,795 --> 00:13:04,862
Hit "print."

314
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:10,644
Hmm.

315
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:12,846
Alarm-company printout

316
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:15,248
of the times
that the vault was accessed.

317
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:16,583
Yeah.

318
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,053
The first ones
are at regular intervals.

319
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:20,387
Gault's daily visits. Right.

320
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:22,055
But on the day that he died,

321
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,059
there are six entries and exits
all clustered together.

322
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:27,928
Okay, well, that wasn't him,
not with that Walker.

323
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:31,699
Something makes
Jonas Gault suspicious.

324
00:13:31,824 --> 00:13:33,801
He calls up the vault entries

325
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:36,837
and sees that someone's
been going in and out.

326
00:13:36,962 --> 00:13:38,673
So he changes the alarm code.

327
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:40,566
And then conveniently dies.

328
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:44,970
This isn't just an art theft.

329
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:49,708
- It's murder.
- It's murder.

330
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,914
Oh. Sterling. Good, come on.

331
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:57,509
Is this an escape? 'Cause if
it is, you're very <i>bad</i> at it.

332
00:13:57,634 --> 00:13:58,910
Gault was murdered
by the same person

333
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:00,211
who stole that painting.

334
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:01,446
Sophie murdered Jonas Gault?

335
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:02,580
Gault was on a fistful
of medications.

336
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:05,583
Nazaprine, Achnofoline
for his heart

337
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,552
and Miridium
for blood thinners.

338
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:09,087
Look at the prescription,
the date he died,

339
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:10,254
and count the pills.

340
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:11,589
There are a dozen missing.

341
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:13,424
Anyone could have stolen those.

342
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:16,094
Yeah, or somebody
could cut open the gel caps,

343
00:14:16,219 --> 00:14:18,196
take the medicine out,

344
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:21,698
dumped it into the glass that
Gault kept by his bedside, hmm?

345
00:14:21,823 --> 00:14:25,035
Now, an old man dies,
nobody cares, right?

346
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,660
Now, if it were me...

347
00:14:28,496 --> 00:14:32,142
I wouldn't just throw away
the empty gel caps.

348
00:14:32,267 --> 00:14:35,445
- I'd flush them down the sink.
- Yeah.

349
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,881
Designed to dissolve
in the stomach.

350
00:14:38,006 --> 00:14:39,450
Takes two weeks
to dissolve in water.

351
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:40,617
Also, Jonas Gault was sure

352
00:14:40,742 --> 00:14:42,619
that someone had gained access
to the vault.

353
00:14:42,744 --> 00:14:46,289
Assuming this is true,

354
00:14:46,414 --> 00:14:48,124
the killer would need
constant access

355
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:49,793
to get into the vault
this number of times.

356
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:51,852
It's a member of the household.

357
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:02,738
Okay, so we've got Shecter,
the family lawyer.

358
00:15:02,863 --> 00:15:05,574
The estate sale
has gone to hell.

359
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:07,743
Then you've got Katrina Hardt,
the art curator.

360
00:15:07,868 --> 00:15:09,412
Collections kept in the house.

361
00:15:09,537 --> 00:15:11,080
I-I-I've never been
in the vault.

362
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:14,250
Next you have Fiona Gault,
the daughter.

363
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,586
There is Eleanor,
the last ex-wife.

364
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:19,089
I could tie a knot in this
for you, if you want.

365
00:15:19,214 --> 00:15:20,924
That's really nice. Thank you.

366
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:23,593
And woodman, the son.

367
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:25,929
Whoever was in the vault
the day Gault died,

368
00:15:26,054 --> 00:15:27,264
that's your killer.

369
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:28,432
You have one hour.

370
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:30,601
If I don't have a suspect
in an hour,

371
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:32,602
you're both
going down for this.

372
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:35,897
Well, I don't need an hour.
I got a Sophie.

373
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,377
Darling, just mute the phone.
I can hear everything.

374
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:45,783
Do you really have to be here?

375
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:47,118
You're not innocent yet.

376
00:15:47,243 --> 00:15:49,620
Sign here, ma'am.

377
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:50,888
Miss Hardt.

378
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:52,389
Oh, Miss Collins. Thank you.

379
00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:53,724
I'm... I'm so sorry.

380
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:55,225
I just... I... the shipping crew
is here to take

381
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,095
all the Mettier paintings
these people purchased,

382
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,430
and it's just, um...

383
00:15:59,555 --> 00:16:00,631
You poor thing,
you're in charge

384
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:02,599
of every single Mettier
in the house.

385
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:04,735
Yes. Jonas had me
here every day.

386
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,738
Really? That's awful.

387
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:11,709
That means you were here
the day he died.

388
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,378
Yes, I arrived that afternoon,

389
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:17,382
and I had no idea that he had
already slipped into a coma.

390
00:16:17,507 --> 00:16:19,051
It makes me so sad that...

391
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:21,220
I was out here arguing
with Fiona

392
00:16:21,345 --> 00:16:24,223
while he was
just slipping away.

393
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:27,060
Six years I have put
into this job!

394
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:29,895
Your job is over,
as far as I'm concerned.

395
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,898
I've decided we no longer need
a full-time curator.

396
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,400
That is not up to you.
That is up to your father.

397
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:39,404
How dare you try and tell me
what my father does...

398
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:41,406
Well, I mean,
I wasn't the C.E.O. At the time,

399
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:43,241
but now that father is gone,
I've accepted

400
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:45,610
that responsibility
as majority shareholder.

401
00:16:45,735 --> 00:16:48,113
And I must see, on behalf
of the U.K. Shareholders,

402
00:16:48,238 --> 00:16:51,116
we couldn't be happier
with the way that turned out.

403
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:53,285
Agreed, clive?

404
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,654
Yes. Of course.
I have to admit,

405
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:58,324
I was in a foul mood
after dealing with Eleanor.

406
00:16:58,449 --> 00:16:59,491
That woman is a...

407
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:02,127
Drunk parasite
leeching off his pit!

408
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:04,629
Your father still loves me

409
00:17:04,754 --> 00:17:07,799
and he trusts me a lot more
than he trusts you.

410
00:17:07,924 --> 00:17:10,301
Hovering over him
like a vulture.

411
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:12,637
When he dies,
you will not get a penny.

412
00:17:12,762 --> 00:17:14,305
He's not going to die.

413
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:18,300
When he gets better,
we'll prove our love to you.

414
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,148
I mean, what better proof
is there than getting remarried?

415
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:26,150
Sure, our first marriage
broke up,

416
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:28,986
but we'd grown
so much since then.

417
00:17:29,111 --> 00:17:31,489
Thank you. God bless you.

418
00:17:33,115 --> 00:17:35,993
I just hope me and my chauncey

419
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:39,830
are as happy
as you and your Jonas were.

420
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:42,565
I'm sure that's why he chose you
as our wedding planner.

421
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,636
Now, when exactly
did he propose?

422
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:48,072
He didn't,

423
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:50,976
but I know he intended to
because the lawyer explained...

424
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:52,811
That's why I'm here, Eleanor.

425
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:54,980
I have to get the documents
to file the marriage certificate

426
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:56,315
and change the will.

427
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,984
I knew it!

428
00:17:58,109 --> 00:18:00,320
It's his wish to pass
his last days with you.

429
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:03,657
Oh! Let's celebrate
with a drink!

430
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,158
I have so much work, Eleanor.

431
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:08,161
But please, don't tell anyone
I told you.

432
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:10,697
Oh, I won't. I promise.

433
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:13,367
Because I knew he was never
going to remarry that woman.

434
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,203
Jonas was just getting
sentimental in his last days,

435
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:20,675
and the havoc that would wreak
on the estate, agent...?

436
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,842
Agent Tennant.

437
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,045
Are you getting this, agent Smith?
Yeah.

438
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,513
Inheritance issues?

439
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,183
Well, there were about to be.

440
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:32,610
Jonas had made
a very radical decision.

441
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,689
He's adding you
back into the will,

442
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,692
your full share
of the inheritance.

443
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,027
I don't want it.

444
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:43,697
Woody, we're talking millions,
plus your share of the stock.

445
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,867
I don't want the money.
None of it.

446
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,136
Can you believe that?

447
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,973
Pardon me.

448
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:56,811
- Hello? Yes?
- I admit, I do find that hard to believe.

449
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,045
What?

450
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,882
I finally understand
what he sees in you.

451
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,383
We need to find woodman.

452
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,477
Don't worry about it.
I'll handle it.

453
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:10,258
Weird, cold nights,

454
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,927
you get a little frost buckle,
it ruins everything.

455
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,896
The British lady's friend,
right?

456
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,564
Nate Ford.

457
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,068
What's a, uh... what's
a millionaire's son doing,

458
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,336
uh, working on a pool?

459
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:26,173
I screwed things up
first go-around, you know?

460
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,176
He gave me everything...

461
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:32,613
Private tutors, apartment
in Tokyo, art school in Paris.

462
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:36,784
I drank it all away.
He kicked me loose.

463
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:40,621
After a couple hard years,
I started a contracting company.

464
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,957
After dad got real sick, well,

465
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,025
I volunteered to fix the pool
just so I could be near him.

466
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,128
Sometimes money
just gets in the way.

467
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,197
Ain't that the truth.

468
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:53,267
The, uh, art girl, Katrina.

469
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,802
Cute, huh?

470
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,838
Was she here
the day your dad died?

471
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:59,507
She was up there as soon as the
maid that found him screamed.

472
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,033
Why?

473
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,919
Not quite sure who wants Gault
dead out of that lot.

474
00:20:10,044 --> 00:20:12,721
All of them but one.

475
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:14,222
Katrina was
about to lose her job,

476
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,490
but if Gault died first,

477
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,292
she'd get a commission
for selling the collection.

478
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,961
Now, Fiona needed Gault to die
before he remarried Eleanor

479
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,629
so that she'd inherit
her shares.

480
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,798
Eleanor suspected
that those shares

481
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,967
were soon to be split
with woodman,

482
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:29,171
who, by the way, is
the only person without motive.

483
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:30,973
<i>Shecter didn't have a motive.</i>

484
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:34,510
Oh, but Shecter knew that Gault
wasn't gonna marry Eleanor,

485
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:36,646
so why is Shecter
in that office

486
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:39,682
pulling financial statements
for Gault instruments?

487
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,884
Shecter's embezzling.

488
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,319
I'd forgotten
how attractive that is,

489
00:20:43,444 --> 00:20:44,821
the relentless tick-tick-tick

490
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:47,189
of you pulling apart
someone's well-laid plans.

491
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:49,524
Oh, including yours.

492
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,092
Oh, you've never
pulled apart my plans.

493
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,428
We are back at square one.

494
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:56,430
On the murder, yes,
but who cares about that?

495
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,289
We're here about an art theft.

496
00:21:00,891 --> 00:21:02,468
Okay, they all alibi each other

497
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:05,204
for the times someone was going
in and out of the vault.

498
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:09,041
So, if the same person who
killed Jonas stole the painting,

499
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,809
then none of them did it.

500
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:11,976
Who's left?

501
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:14,102
Nobody.

502
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:21,641
Ooh!

503
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:27,223
I'm sorry.

504
00:21:27,348 --> 00:21:29,058
What are you doing in my room?

505
00:21:29,183 --> 00:21:32,785
So, the Butler did it.

506
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:45,966
Miss Hardt.

507
00:21:52,673 --> 00:21:54,474
It's just beautiful.

508
00:21:59,113 --> 00:22:01,858
Ma mystère... can you be sure?

509
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:03,659
It's never been photographed
or exhibited.

510
00:22:03,784 --> 00:22:05,061
But thanks to Jonas,

511
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:07,763
I am the world's leading expert
in precisely one artist.

512
00:22:07,888 --> 00:22:09,265
Mettier.

513
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,424
Hmm.

514
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:21,177
Brush strokes are right.
Texture on the oils.

515
00:22:21,302 --> 00:22:23,513
Color palette is consistent
with his early works.

516
00:22:23,638 --> 00:22:26,182
He stretched his own canvas.
Those are his nails.

517
00:22:26,307 --> 00:22:29,485
I would have to do more tests,
but honestly, this is Mettier.

518
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,956
And the only one
I've never seen before.

519
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:35,424
It's ma mystère.

520
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:43,899
Miss Hardt, you can release
the rest of the collection

521
00:22:44,024 --> 00:22:45,134
to the buyers.

522
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:48,137
I'll tag this for evidence
and return it to the estate

523
00:22:48,262 --> 00:22:50,139
as soon as possible.
Of course. Thank you.

524
00:22:50,264 --> 00:22:51,940
Thank you.

525
00:22:52,065 --> 00:22:54,777
It's always nice
to bring a thief to justice,

526
00:22:54,902 --> 00:22:58,114
even if it's not you.

527
00:22:58,239 --> 00:22:59,739
Or you.

528
00:23:01,275 --> 00:23:04,153
Only one problem. Hmm?

529
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:06,579
That is not ma mystère.

530
00:23:08,977 --> 00:23:10,367
What do you mean
"it's not ma mystère."

531
00:23:10,492 --> 00:23:12,149
It's complicated. Look.

532
00:23:12,274 --> 00:23:14,217
What?

533
00:23:14,342 --> 00:23:16,453
Gault's own curator
thinks it's legit.

534
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:18,521
I'm telling you
that is not ma mystère.

535
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:20,123
But how could you know that?

536
00:23:20,248 --> 00:23:23,292
Uh... um...

537
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:24,793
Did you try to steal it once?
No.

538
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:26,461
Hmm. Did you actually steal it once?
No.

539
00:23:26,586 --> 00:23:29,964
Look, it could be a Mettier,
but it is not ma mystère.

540
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:31,666
How do you even know
what ma mystère is?

541
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,067
I mean,
there's no photographs...

542
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:34,569
I just...
I need you to trust me.

543
00:23:34,694 --> 00:23:37,571
Ah. You.

544
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:40,040
You have actually seen
ma mystère, haven't you?

545
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:41,108
Not exactly.

546
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:43,744
Look, what if I can prove it
to you?

547
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:47,281
Look,
if it's not ma mystère,

548
00:23:47,406 --> 00:23:49,149
how do we even know
that it's a real Mettier?

549
00:23:49,274 --> 00:23:51,085
Well, the way to prove
that it's not a Mettier

550
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,853
would be to compare it
to another Mettier.

551
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:54,288
That's true,

552
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:55,756
and they've all been sold
to all these other rich people,

553
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,757
and that...

554
00:23:57,882 --> 00:23:59,092
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

555
00:23:59,217 --> 00:24:00,494
Sophie, no, no, no.

556
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:02,329
You are not gonna go in there
and steal a real Mettier.

557
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:03,764
No, no, no.
It wouldn't be stealing.

558
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:05,432
I'd just borrow it
just for a little while

559
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:07,435
just to compare it to ma mystère
and prove its a fact.

560
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,139
Which means we have to also
steal ma mystère.

561
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,241
I just got you off the hook
from stealing that painting.

562
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:15,276
Now you want to go and steal
that and another painting

563
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:16,778
just to prove it isn't real?
I don't want to.

564
00:24:16,903 --> 00:24:18,780
What I want is
for you to take me at my word.

565
00:24:18,905 --> 00:24:20,449
We've been working together
for five years,

566
00:24:20,574 --> 00:24:22,284
sleeping together for two.

567
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:23,953
I mean, what is it gonna take?

568
00:24:28,816 --> 00:24:33,964
Sterling is sitting
right on top of ma mystère.

569
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:36,800
Are you telling me
you can't outsmart Sterling?

570
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:38,301
I can't.

571
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:41,304
But he can't outsmart me,
either.

572
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:42,472
Okay, you go get Mettier.

573
00:24:42,597 --> 00:24:44,808
I'll deal with Sterling
and get ma mystère.

574
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:46,433
Hmm?

575
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:56,285
Crate that up,
put an evidence sticker on it.

576
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,622
We'll take it with us
when we finish the interviews.

577
00:24:59,747 --> 00:25:01,958
We'll handle the...

578
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:06,796
Jurisdictional issues.

579
00:25:06,921 --> 00:25:07,964
What do you want?

580
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,699
Ah, nothing.

581
00:25:09,824 --> 00:25:15,038
That's... that's
the whole case? Yeah?

582
00:25:15,163 --> 00:25:17,340
Just...

583
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:20,210
If by which you mean the means,
the motive, the opportunity,

584
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:22,079
the fact
that I found the stolen item

585
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:23,881
in the possession
of the suspect...

586
00:25:24,006 --> 00:25:25,116
Yes, that's my whole case.

587
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:26,584
I'll put that
in front of a jury.

588
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,752
Yeah? Hmm.

589
00:25:28,877 --> 00:25:31,055
You think
I've missed something?

590
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,090
Hmm.

591
00:25:33,215 --> 00:25:36,260
That's it.

592
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:38,596
Oh, you'd like to see
my whole case fall apart

593
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:40,255
just on some little...

594
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,901
Go back to the beginning!

595
00:25:44,026 --> 00:25:48,630
Take that...
To the billiard room.

596
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,711
Um, all the shipping labels
are already on.

597
00:25:54,836 --> 00:25:56,780
Once you get them
to the shipping house,

598
00:25:56,905 --> 00:25:59,549
they will unload them and send
them to their destination.

599
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:00,550
Okay.

600
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:03,353
Oh, goodie.
Ooh, that's my painting.

601
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,554
Ma'am?

602
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:06,222
My painting.
I'd like it, please.

603
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:07,457
Oh, no offense.

604
00:26:07,582 --> 00:26:09,759
You and your company, I've
lost art in shipping before,

605
00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:12,562
you see, and I prefer to have
my possessions in my possession.

606
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:14,797
Well, you know I can't just
give you the painting.

607
00:26:14,922 --> 00:26:16,466
Oh, I'm sorry.
You don't know who I am?

608
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:18,968
I'm the duchess
of Islington-barrow.

609
00:26:19,093 --> 00:26:21,238
That is my property,
and I would like it.

610
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:22,539
I need to see some I.D.

611
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:26,877
Do I look as if I came out
carrying out I.D. On me?

612
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,579
Miss Hardt?

613
00:26:28,704 --> 00:26:29,713
Oh, uh, yes, Miss Collins.

614
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:30,981
Oh, Miss Hardt,
I've got to say,

615
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:32,483
I'm really impressed
with your security.

616
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:35,152
I was thinking I'd like
to hire them the next time

617
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:37,488
the London art museum
loans something out.

618
00:26:37,613 --> 00:26:40,224
The thing is, I was asking him
for his contact info

619
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,425
and he wouldn't give it to me.

620
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,926
What? No.

621
00:26:43,051 --> 00:26:44,761
Which, you know, he said
it's protocol. I get it.

622
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:46,096
You know,
it's good for security,

623
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:48,097
but it's rubbish for business.

624
00:26:48,222 --> 00:26:49,632
Do you think you could just...

625
00:26:49,757 --> 00:26:51,934
Frank, Frank, don't be paranoid.
Just give it to her.

626
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:55,938
Thank you.
Frank, let's be friends. Don't pout.

627
00:26:56,063 --> 00:26:57,830
Cold.

628
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:02,668
Cold.

629
00:27:05,872 --> 00:27:07,173
Cold, cold.

630
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:10,676
Cold.

631
00:27:14,614 --> 00:27:15,681
Warm.

632
00:27:16,749 --> 00:27:17,625
Ish.

633
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,960
Get out.

634
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:20,795
Hmm?

635
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,987
Very warm.

636
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:27,270
Follow him.

637
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,895
Yes, sir.

638
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:54,755
I-I just left my phone in here.

639
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,337
You guys, cake's on fire!

640
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:02,505
Oh, God! Oh!

641
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,839
Excuse me. Let me through here.

642
00:28:03,964 --> 00:28:05,198
Watch out, people. Move back.

643
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:18,353
Darn phone.
I just can't find it.

644
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:20,379
I can't find the darn phone.

645
00:28:22,783 --> 00:28:25,494
Mettier mixed his own paint.

646
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:28,998
He used copal resin and clay
earth found near his home.

647
00:28:29,123 --> 00:28:32,001
There's no way
a forger could match

648
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:34,169
the exact chemical composition
of his paint.

649
00:28:34,294 --> 00:28:35,704
Okay.

650
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:39,208
A little, uh, silver Polish.
Right.

651
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:40,642
That.

652
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:42,435
Bleach.

653
00:28:44,004 --> 00:28:46,714
And top it off...

654
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:50,118
With some fine vodka.

655
00:28:50,243 --> 00:28:52,111
I think I drank this
in college.

656
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,392
This from this painting.

657
00:28:57,517 --> 00:28:59,919
And a little of that
from that painting.

658
00:29:06,726 --> 00:29:08,661
Okay. If you will.

659
00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:16,078
Well, that is a match.

660
00:29:16,203 --> 00:29:18,580
They can't match.

661
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:20,082
It's as close
as we're gonna get

662
00:29:20,207 --> 00:29:21,516
without stealing
a chemistry lab,

663
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:26,521
and we're not gonna go, you
know, steal a-a chemistry I...

664
00:29:26,646 --> 00:29:29,857
I was just... I was so sure
it was gonna be...

665
00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:33,194
Something else.

666
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:36,688
I was wrong, I guess.
It ma mystère.

667
00:29:38,357 --> 00:29:41,192
What did you think
it was gonna be?

668
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:49,143
There is one other possibility,
of course.

669
00:29:49,268 --> 00:29:52,813
The paintings match.

670
00:29:52,938 --> 00:29:57,484
So either that is
the real ma mystère or...

671
00:29:57,609 --> 00:29:59,486
It's a fake Mettier.

672
00:29:59,611 --> 00:30:00,554
That doesn't make sense.

673
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:02,456
It came straight out
of Gault's collection.

674
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:04,458
Even if there was
a fake in there,

675
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:07,094
what are the chances that I just
happened to steal that one?

676
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:09,597
Slim.

677
00:30:09,722 --> 00:30:13,025
Unless all the paintings
are fake.

678
00:30:14,661 --> 00:30:19,165
Or Gault's entire collection
is fake.

679
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:22,947
So let me get this straight.

680
00:30:23,116 --> 00:30:24,659
You stole not one,
let but two paintings, ht.

681
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:27,628
One of which
you spent the entire day

682
00:30:27,753 --> 00:30:29,463
trying to convince me
you did not steal,

683
00:30:29,588 --> 00:30:31,132
all because
your girlfriend here,

684
00:30:31,257 --> 00:30:34,569
an unrepentant,
inveterate, professional liar...

685
00:30:34,694 --> 00:30:36,604
That's uncalled for.

686
00:30:36,729 --> 00:30:39,106
Told you
with no evidence whatsoever

687
00:30:39,231 --> 00:30:40,607
that ma mystère was fake.

688
00:30:40,732 --> 00:30:42,309
Now you're so sure
that she's right,

689
00:30:42,434 --> 00:30:44,644
that you not only think
that <i>this</i> painting is a fake,

690
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:47,614
but every other Mettier
that was in the house,

691
00:30:47,739 --> 00:30:50,650
the entire collection,
is also fake?

692
00:30:50,775 --> 00:30:52,409
That's right.

693
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:57,156
Arrest them both.

694
00:30:57,281 --> 00:30:59,025
On what charge?

695
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,092
Theft.

696
00:31:00,217 --> 00:31:01,661
We've brought you back
the paintings.

697
00:31:01,786 --> 00:31:03,930
Obstructing an investigation.

698
00:31:04,055 --> 00:31:05,164
We're helping you
with your investigation.

699
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:06,933
Being annoying and crazy.

700
00:31:07,058 --> 00:31:07,844
That's not a crime.

701
00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:09,699
Since when was that a crime?
No, it's not.

702
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,495
I don't care!

703
00:31:14,265 --> 00:31:15,675
All right,
all right, all right.

704
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:22,115
Say, just say,
that you're right.

705
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,084
Do you have any idea
what it would take

706
00:31:24,209 --> 00:31:26,719
to replace every one of these
paintings with a forgery?

707
00:31:26,844 --> 00:31:28,087
Yeah, well, for starters,
I mean,

708
00:31:28,212 --> 00:31:29,723
you would probably need
an elderly victim

709
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,458
whose eyesight was shot
so much to the point

710
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:32,993
where he wouldn't notice
the switches.

711
00:31:33,118 --> 00:31:36,697
He'd have to repaint
every single painting.

712
00:31:36,822 --> 00:31:39,033
Yes. Yes, so you'd need time.

713
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:40,501
Months. Months.

714
00:31:40,626 --> 00:31:43,737
You'd need
a detailed knowledge of Mettier,

715
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:45,306
plus access
to all the paintings.

716
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:46,974
Yes, and most important,
of course,

717
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:49,176
you would need the ability
to establish provenance.

718
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:51,178
You would need to declare,
without question,

719
00:31:51,303 --> 00:31:52,713
that every one
of these paintings

720
00:31:52,838 --> 00:31:55,716
is absolutely
and undeniably legitimate.

721
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:58,251
The curator.

722
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:02,255
Hey!

723
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,491
I don't suppose anyone here
spent the last few years

724
00:32:04,616 --> 00:32:08,127
secretly replacing every Mettier
in the house with forgeries

725
00:32:08,252 --> 00:32:09,787
while no one was looking.

726
00:32:16,861 --> 00:32:18,872
Very slick interrogation.

727
00:32:18,997 --> 00:32:20,541
I didn't think that would work.

728
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:21,542
She's getting away.

729
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:24,669
I didn't think that would work!

730
00:32:27,507 --> 00:32:29,718
All right, uh, you go that way
and I'll go this...

731
00:32:55,403 --> 00:32:57,413
Fleeing the scene of the crime,

732
00:32:57,538 --> 00:32:59,081
she slipped
on the edge of the pool,

733
00:32:59,206 --> 00:33:01,083
hit her head, fell in.

734
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,252
Accidental death.

735
00:33:03,377 --> 00:33:07,423
Nothing like bringing a thief
to justice again.

736
00:33:07,548 --> 00:33:09,725
Hey, you know what?
Look at the bright side.

737
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,060
You solved a theft, a murder.

738
00:33:11,185 --> 00:33:12,929
And once you go through
that woman's records,

739
00:33:13,054 --> 00:33:15,399
you'll find all the people that
bought those stolen paintings.

740
00:33:15,524 --> 00:33:17,134
I mean, it was
a pretty big forgery ring.

741
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:20,270
And despite your efforts
to drop off the map,

742
00:33:20,395 --> 00:33:23,106
I now know
your new base of operations.

743
00:33:23,231 --> 00:33:27,110
Everything is
sunshine and rainbows.

744
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:29,445
Be seeing you.

745
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,115
Ugh. He thinks he's so
intimidating, but he's not.

746
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,785
Let's get the hell out of here
before he changes his mind.

747
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,544
Yeah.

748
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,629
I was right.
It <i>was</i> like old times.

749
00:33:46,754 --> 00:33:48,631
It was.

750
00:33:48,756 --> 00:33:52,135
Art theft, chases,
dresses, and tuxedos.

751
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,471
I just...

752
00:33:54,596 --> 00:33:56,640
I wish I had gotten to see
the real ma mystère.

753
00:33:56,765 --> 00:33:58,108
Eh.

754
00:33:58,233 --> 00:34:00,277
Sterling might find it once he
goes through Katrina's files.

755
00:34:00,402 --> 00:34:01,644
Mm.

756
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:06,483
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you
how I knew it was a fake.

757
00:34:06,608 --> 00:34:08,652
It's just, it's personal.

758
00:34:08,777 --> 00:34:11,054
But I really appreciate
your faith.

759
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:12,189
I-I treasure it.

760
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:14,325
You made a good point.

761
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,327
I should trust you.
I mean, I do trust you.

762
00:34:16,452 --> 00:34:19,287
I do. And...

763
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:25,771
Look, you and me, we're...

764
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:28,240
Me and you, we're...

765
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:32,035
Oh, it's just that...
We are, uh...

766
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,248
Shoes.

767
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:37,750
Huh?

768
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,786
That's how I found you.
Your shoes.

769
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:42,788
When you left that day,
you know,

770
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:45,792
you were wearing your
fancy shoes, uh, the high heels.

771
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,795
They're high enough for fashion,
low enough to run in.

772
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,297
You never looked at my feet.

773
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,299
Didn't have to. They sound
different on a wooden floor.

774
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,068
You're so clever.

775
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:55,303
What about the party?

776
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:57,572
Well, I mean, if you were
wearing those shoes,

777
00:34:57,697 --> 00:35:00,141
it meant one thing... an event,
which meant catering.

778
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:02,043
So I called
all the high-end caterers

779
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:04,546
and I found that, uh,
there was one party.

780
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:05,714
An art auction.

781
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,350
That brain of yours is very,
very sexy.

782
00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:11,788
Oh, thank you very much.
How about the rest of me?

783
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:15,792
It's a little beat-up, but...

784
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:19,896
It has its charm.

785
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:25,358
I have a change of clothes
for the morning.

786
00:35:39,907 --> 00:35:43,476
I'm such an idiot.

787
00:35:49,048 --> 00:35:50,758
Nate?

788
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:16,184
It didn't matter how many times
she came in and out.

789
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:19,020
She still couldn't crack
the second alarm.

790
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:24,249
But you knew that already,
didn't you?

791
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:27,816
They'll hear a gunshot.

792
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:29,778
Place is empty.

793
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:32,023
Too much death.

794
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,090
Everybody's freaked out.

795
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:35,491
Art school in Paris?

796
00:36:35,616 --> 00:36:38,260
Wasn't talented enough
to sell <i>my</i> stuff.

797
00:36:38,385 --> 00:36:40,529
But after dad cut me off, well,

798
00:36:40,654 --> 00:36:42,464
talented enough
to fake other people's art.

799
00:36:42,589 --> 00:36:44,834
Good coin for a while, too.

800
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:48,003
Then he got sick and I came home
to scam some money,

801
00:36:48,128 --> 00:36:49,137
and there it was.

802
00:36:49,262 --> 00:36:51,673
A whole house
full of valuable paintings.

803
00:36:51,798 --> 00:36:53,908
Hmm. With its own curator.

804
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:55,176
Lonely curator.

805
00:36:55,301 --> 00:36:57,879
The interpol agent found out
about the forgeries.

806
00:36:58,004 --> 00:37:00,047
Woody, they know.
They know about the paintings.

807
00:37:00,172 --> 00:37:02,049
Aah!

808
00:37:02,174 --> 00:37:04,885
You'd, um, switch out one
painting every couple of months.

809
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,387
Nice.

810
00:37:07,512 --> 00:37:09,622
When did you decide
to go after ma mystère?

811
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:12,024
When I saw the keypad,
and I knew the numbers.

812
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:15,227
You painted the duplicate
in advance.

813
00:37:15,352 --> 00:37:18,897
Of course, you'd, um, have to
guess what it looked like.

814
00:37:19,022 --> 00:37:19,965
No one else had seen it.

815
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,734
Ah.

816
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:26,238
But tried to keep it
close at hand, didn't you?

817
00:37:26,363 --> 00:37:28,498
Do you think
that's what tipped him?

818
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:35,381
When he saw someone was
going in and out of the vault,

819
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:39,051
he called the alarm company
and took precautions.

820
00:37:40,444 --> 00:37:42,821
Although you'd gone in and out
a bunch of times,

821
00:37:42,946 --> 00:37:46,224
he changed the code
on that last trip.

822
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:49,460
Why did you go in and out
so many times?

823
00:37:49,585 --> 00:37:51,262
Think you got it
all figured out.

824
00:37:51,387 --> 00:37:53,664
But you're not as smart
as you think you are.

825
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:55,466
I'm smarter than you.

826
00:37:55,591 --> 00:37:58,102
I'm smart enough
not to kill my partner.

827
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,474
You are a compulsive,
obsessive, selfish...

828
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,810
Really should run!

829
00:38:05,935 --> 00:38:08,737
Right.

830
00:38:14,577 --> 00:38:16,655
Oh! Just letting you know,
if we die, I blame you.

831
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,657
I know.
None of this would have happened

832
00:38:18,782 --> 00:38:20,492
if you'd just gone to the movies
like I told you.

833
00:38:20,617 --> 00:38:21,927
Yeah, if I'd gone to the movies,
you'd be in jail right now.

834
00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:24,964
Jail is a big improvement
on my current prospect

835
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:26,189
of soon to be murdered.

836
00:38:29,761 --> 00:38:30,827
Sophie, run. Run.

837
00:38:46,146 --> 00:38:48,858
You kept the cuffs. Naughty.

838
00:38:48,983 --> 00:38:51,527
That the shallow end, right?

839
00:38:51,652 --> 00:38:53,986
Oops.

840
00:38:55,522 --> 00:38:56,665
Anyone else in the vicinity

841
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,133
you'd like me to arrest
for the same crime?

842
00:38:58,258 --> 00:39:00,469
Or is three our lucky number?

843
00:39:00,594 --> 00:39:01,803
This is it.

844
00:39:01,928 --> 00:39:03,905
He got ma mystère out,
but Gault changed the code

845
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,208
before he could get
the fake into place.

846
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:07,476
Yes.

847
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:08,944
Couldn't let a perfectly good
fake go to waste,

848
00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:10,312
so he framed Paolo with it.

849
00:39:10,437 --> 00:39:11,914
And the real ma mystère?

850
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,716
Eh, we'll get it out of him.

851
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:15,384
Again...

852
00:39:15,509 --> 00:39:16,519
Be seeing you.

853
00:39:16,644 --> 00:39:19,188
Turns out, you're still

854
00:39:19,313 --> 00:39:21,190
the second-best detective
I've ever known.

855
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:22,758
Ah. So are you.

856
00:39:22,883 --> 00:39:26,562
You ever want to do this again,
call me.

857
00:39:26,687 --> 00:39:29,064
I'm hiring.

858
00:39:29,189 --> 00:39:31,099
And you can bring
the art thief.

859
00:39:31,224 --> 00:39:33,769
Ex-art thief.

860
00:39:36,229 --> 00:39:38,730
Ex-art thief.

861
00:39:46,905 --> 00:39:51,217
I would really have liked to
have seen it, just to know.

862
00:39:51,342 --> 00:39:56,390
How does a forger defeat
a two-tiered security system

863
00:39:56,515 --> 00:39:58,959
in less than an afternoon?

864
00:39:59,084 --> 00:40:01,962
I mean, when they don't have
those skills,

865
00:40:02,087 --> 00:40:04,355
the skill he <i>does</i> have...

866
00:40:05,324 --> 00:40:07,125
Is in construction.

867
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:18,212
See, all he had to do was just
wait until after the auction.

868
00:40:18,337 --> 00:40:20,715
Shecter turned off the alarm
on the painting.

869
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,077
Then they could come back
anytime.

870
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:25,912
They just had to
keep the painting hidden.

871
00:40:26,037 --> 00:40:28,639
So he built a false wall
and hid the painting there.

872
00:40:32,546 --> 00:40:34,824
I bared my soul to him.

873
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:36,892
You bared more than your soul.

874
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,728
He vowed it would never be seen
by the world

875
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,563
till after my death.

876
00:40:41,688 --> 00:40:43,064
So we're gonna steal it.

877
00:40:43,189 --> 00:40:44,232
Of course we are, darling.

878
00:40:44,357 --> 00:40:45,567
To honor his wishes.

879
00:40:45,692 --> 00:40:46,902
Of course.

880
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,070
ma mystère.

881
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,872
He never even showed it to me
after he painted it,

882
00:40:50,997 --> 00:40:54,643
and then I wasn't really tempted
when I knew it was locked up.

883
00:40:54,768 --> 00:40:55,978
That's...

884
00:40:56,103 --> 00:40:57,479
Yes.

885
00:40:57,604 --> 00:40:58,847
You are...

886
00:40:58,972 --> 00:41:00,482
Very young.

887
00:41:00,607 --> 00:41:02,275
And...

888
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:07,780
Very naked. Yes.

889
00:41:19,327 --> 00:41:20,536
I think you look better now.

890
00:41:20,661 --> 00:41:21,604
Oh.

891
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:26,066
Mr. Ford,
you are quite the charmer.
