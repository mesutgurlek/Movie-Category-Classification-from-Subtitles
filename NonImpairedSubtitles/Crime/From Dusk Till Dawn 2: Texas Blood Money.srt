1
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,000
Christ, it's almost midnight.

2
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,480
Nothing like putting in some overtime
to save a miserable serial killer.

3
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,480
Alleged serial killer.

4
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,680
Right.

5
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,600
- Well...

6
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,600
maybe one of these days we'll actually
defend somebody who's really innocent.

7
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
- A man is innocent until proven guilty.
- Until proven guilty.

8
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,200
Look, you and I both know that son of
a bitch killed 14 people in cold blood.

9
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,640
- I just hope there's nothing
to this karma thing.
- Oh, please.

10
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,280
- Ah, come on. What the hell?

11
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,760
And I don't want to hear
anything about any karma.

12
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,880
- What's going on?
- I'm gonna find out.

13
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,640
I'm gonna check out
the elevator shaft.

14
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,240
- Yeah, okay.
- Maybe there's a way out.

15
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,920
- Oh, Jesus.

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,520
- What's happening? Are they bats?

17
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
- Danny?

18
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,640
Oh, God! Oh, God! Somebody help me!
Please! Please! Somebody help me!

19
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,760
Please!
Oh, God! Please!

20
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,600
No! No! No! No!

21
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,480
Ah, come on. Just when it was
getting to the good part.

22
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,480
- Christ, not again.

23
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,960
Hey, take a little
breather, honey.

24
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,160
I lost my concentration.

25
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,000
Goddamn piece of crap.

26
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,080
Looks like the only thing
working around here is me.

27
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,960
- Sons of bitches.
- That's what you get...

28
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,960
for stealing cable, Buck.

29
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,760
The first full solar eclipse to be seen
locally in over 35 years--

30
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,680
...while transporting
Luther Heggs...

31
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,720
from the Kern County Jail
to the Huntsville State Penitentiary.

32
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
Heggs, you may remember,
was convicted for armed robbery.

33
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,640
An unscheduled stop was made
at a gas station rest room.

34
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,240
When Heggs persuaded the deputy
to remove one of the cuffs
so he could use the toilet...

35
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,520
Heggs severely beat the deputy...

36
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,800
wrestled away the key
to the cuffs and fled the scene.

37
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,800
- Looks like Luther beat the dog shit...
- In a moment we'll be speaking...

38
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,480
- out of that boy.
- to legendary Texas Ranger Otis Lawson.

39
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,000
Officer Lawson, could we have the latest
developments concerning Luther Heggs?

40
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,600
Yes. Uh, we have
all available--

41
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,520
Hey, ain't that the old boy who put you
away in that Lubbock bank job?

42
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,320
Rotten bastard.

43
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,320
I'd like to say that...

44
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,000
I-I-I will personally
track down Luther Heggs...

45
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,400
and drag his ass
back to the penitentiary...

46
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,800
where the sorry
son of a bitch belongs.

47
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,240
All right, asshole.
Start talking.

48
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,200
- You got a warrant, Otis?
- Did I give you that?

49
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,760
Damn, Sheriff. I thought I--
Let's see, did you--

50
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,680
- There is it. ls that warrant
enough for you? Huh?

51
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,720
- Forget about the warrant, Otis.
- Okay.

52
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,960
- Thank you for cooperating.

53
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,680
Now, where is he?
Don't say, "Who?"

54
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
I ain't heard a peep from him.

55
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,600
Oh, shit. Goddamn.

56
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,200
Luther and me--
We ain't as tight as we once was.

57
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,760
Ever since l went straight.
I don't run in them circles.

58
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,960
Bullshit, Buck.
Goddamn it.

59
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,800
You're a criminal.
You always were, and you always will be.

60
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,760
- Just like your daddy.
- No, I swear to God, Otis.

61
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,680
- I'm selling them Swifty products.
- Shut up.

62
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,920
- Show her the picture.
- You seen this man?

63
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,880
- Yes, I have.
- When and where?

64
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,640
About an hour ago, on the TV.

65
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,120
Do you think we're just wasting
our time coming over here...

66
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
like we suck farts
out of a dead chicken?

67
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,080
- She don't know nothing about it.
- She might not, but you sure do.

68
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,200
'Cause you and Luther
are butt-buddies...

69
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,680
from way back.

70
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,800
And sooner or later,
he's gonna contact you...

71
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,680
and when he does,
we'll be waiting.

72
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,040
Don't forget that, slick.

73
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,280
Ma'am.

74
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,160
- Yeah?

75
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,640
- Well, hey, Mama.
- Shit.

76
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,040
Yeah, well, listen, Mama.
I'm gonna have to call you back
a little bit later, all right?

77
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,440
- All right. I love you too.

78
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,280
- Buck... your mama's dead.

79
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,000
- Yeah?
- You clear?

80
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,960
- It is now. Are you okay?
- Yeah. l've been better.

81
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,160
Listen up, man.
That Mexican bank deal is back on.

82
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,080
We gotta move
double fast, though.

83
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,160
- Are you sure the money's still there?
- Yeah, it's still there.

84
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,080
Five million in freshly-laundered...

85
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,400
gringo drug money.

86
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,640
Round up a crew and meet me
at that El Coyote Motel
across the border tomorrow night.

87
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,560
All right, Luther.

88
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,680
Shit. I gotta get out
of here, man.

89
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,520
I'll be in around 7:30,
run the whole thing down to everybody.

90
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,000
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

91
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,200
- the champion of champions...

92
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,960
Roddy Pugh!

93
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,520
All right! Yeah!

94
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,320
Hang on, cowboy,
I'm coming. Come here, bull! Come to me!

95
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,440
Come to me, baby!
Come here!

96
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,640
Watch out for that there bull!

97
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,840
Come on! Better run, better run!

98
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,080
There goes Widow Maker!

99
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,200
Howdy, C.W.

100
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,120
Did you see it?

101
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,000
Yep.

102
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,600
I reckon I've lost a step.

103
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,000
I reckon.

104
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,480
So how the hell
are things, C.W.?

105
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,240
Well, I fractured my ass bone...

106
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,160
Fay left me...

107
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,360
I'm three months behind
on my note...

108
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,480
and I had to hock
my horse and trailer.

109
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,400
Goddamn, man. lf your dog was dead,
we'd have us a country song.

110
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,160
Scooter got hit by a car
and killed last month.

111
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,400
Jesus, C.W., I'm sorry.
I was just joking, man.

112
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,200
Oh, hell, Buck. You know me and
good luck was always strangers.

113
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
So what's the pitch?

114
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,960
I'm guessing you didn't come here
to scout my clowning skills.

115
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,640
Nah, there's no clowning
involved here.

116
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,520
Luther's got a deal going.
Looks like a good one.

117
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,720
We need you to open the box.

118
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,320
- Is my end more than a hundred thou?
- Way more.

119
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,400
Jesus, it's Buck. Don't shoot,
you paranoid son of a bitch.

120
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,360
Didn't you see the signs?

121
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,680
The only thing I gotta beware of
is your crazy ass. Got a beer?

122
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,800
- Jaws is looking pretty strong.
- Jaws is dead.

123
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,400
I lost him in a fight
a while back.

124
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,600
This is Jaws 2.

125
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,000
I got him on the juice.

126
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,960
You're pumping steroids into a pooch?
Damn, Jesus.

127
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,960
That's immoral.

128
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,760
Hey, it ain't the fuckin' Olympics,
Buck. I mean, this is dog fighting.

129
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,160
He's got a big match coming up.

130
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,400
Hey, go, Jaws, go!

131
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,560
I got a deal
you might want to get in on.

132
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,040
Who's setting up the deal?

133
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,000
- Luther.
- Besides you and Luther...

134
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,800
who else is on the crew?

135
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,880
C.W. Niles and Ray Bob.

136
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,800
Ray Bob?
He's an idiot.

137
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,880
I don't work with idiots.
They get you killed.

138
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,320
Yeah, well, you don't
pick the crew, l do.

139
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,840
And I say he's in.
You don't like it, fuck you.

140
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,400
- What would my end be?

141
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,080
- Figure 600 grand, give or take.

142
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,640
- How's that Lincoln running?
- Like a burnt dead dog.

143
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,080
Good boy!
That's a good boy!

144
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,840
Go, Jaws! Go!
Yeah, that's a good boy.

145
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,600
Bucky!
What the hell!

146
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,360
What do you want to sneak up
on me like that for, huh, Bucky?

147
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,360
That's some tight-ass security
you got going here, Ray Bob.

148
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,640
I thought you was
the damn supervisor.

149
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,600
Oh, hell, Bucky.

150
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,000
There ain't nothing here
to guard anyway.

151
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,160
- So what's up?
- A job's what's up.

152
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,360
Set us up for a good long time.

153
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,280
Yeah?
I don't know, Bucky.

154
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,480
- I mean, Alma's got me
on such a short leash and all.
- Knock it off...

155
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,160
you pussy-whipped son of a bitch.

156
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,240
I'm going out on the line
for you here.

157
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,280
You ain't exactly
everybody's first choice.

158
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,480
Really?

159
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,160
Wh-When-When's this
supposed to happen?

160
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,040
- We hit the road tomorrow.
Going to Mexico.

161
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,480
- What am I gonna tell Alma?
- I don't care what you tell her.

162
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,560
You just pack a bag, bring your .45
and be ready to roll at high noon.

163
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,960
Get some sleep.

164
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,360
- Twice a day.
- Si, senor.

165
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,920
Hey, Buck, C.W.
Nice ride, Jesus.

166
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,920
- Well, l had to
tell her something.

167
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,920
Ray Bob,
we don't need this shit.

168
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,720
Ready.

169
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,520
El Coyote?
What's that mean in American, Jesus?

170
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,640
The coyote.

171
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,840
- It ideal.
- Come in with me, Jesus.

172
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,760
Just in case I gotta talk Mexican.

173
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,480
C.W., take the car down to number seven,
start unloading the gear.

174
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,360
Howdy.
You speak English, lady?

175
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,240
English, Spanish
and a little bit of Japanese.

176
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,720
We need a room.
Number seven will do.

177
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Hey, baby.

178
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,160
El fucko?

179
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
Sweet Jesus.

180
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,880
Come on, Jesus.

181
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,600
- Now ain't the time.

182
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,920
Let's get
this crap inside quick.

183
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,840
Yowza, boss.

184
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,320
- This movie is very low quality.

185
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
Don't look that bad to me.

186
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,600
- There's no story.
- It's a fuck movie.

187
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,760
I don't watch a fuck movie
for the story.

188
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,320
I watch a fuck movie
to see fuckin'.

189
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,640
I got to side with Jesus
on this one.

190
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,360
I personally appreciate
an attempt at telling a story.

191
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,160
When I care more about the characters,
I care more about the fucking.

192
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,920
Now, my main complaint
about this movie here...

193
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,560
is we've been watching it
for something like a half hour,

194
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,160
- and there ain't been no ass fuckin'.

195
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,880
- Fuck me runnin'.

196
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,520
This is my kind of place.

197
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,560
Christ.

198
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,160
- Howdy.

199
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,680
Give me a shot of tequila, man.

200
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,600
Here you go.

201
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,440
Goddamn, man!

202
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,040
Give me a... shot of whiskey
or something.

203
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,160
Say, what would be the odds
of gettin' a cab out here?

204
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,800
Odds of getting a cab
are about zero to none.

205
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,600
- No cabs come out here.
- Shit.

206
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,760
- You got car trouble?
- Yeah. Weirdest thing, man.

207
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,040
I hit a fuckin' bat.

208
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Messed up my vehicle real good.

209
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,960
Hell, you say.
Where you headed?

210
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,880
- That El Coyote Motel.
- I get off in about half hour.

211
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,480
Would you like a lift?

212
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,720
- Yep?
- Hey, Buck. Broke down, man.

213
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,040
Luther, we were starting
to worry about you, boy.

214
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,320
- Want us to come and get you?
- No, y'all stay put.

215
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,240
This old boy here
is gonna give me a lift.

216
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,720
Mighty decent of you, man.
I appreciate it.

217
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,640
No problem.

218
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,760
What kind of bat
did you hit?

219
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,440
I don't know, man.
A fuckin' bat. A big one.

220
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,000
- You know, there's many varieties of bats.
- Yeah?

221
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,400
I didn't know that.

222
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,480
Damn thing scared the shit
out of me, though.

223
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,640
I pumped
a bullet in the bastard.

224
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,840
Aren't we going
the wrong direction here, man?

225
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,880
Is that your jeep?

226
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,920
Yeah.

227
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,560
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry here.
You know what I mean?

228
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,480
Just take a second.
Come on.

229
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,800
You said you hit a big, old fuckin' bat.
Where is it?

230
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,920
Well, man, I imagine it
crawled off somewhere to die.

231
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,280
I don't see no point
in all of this.

232
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,440
Oh, there's a point, all right.

233
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,480
Victor.

234
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,160
Victor.

235
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,760
Victor.

236
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,760
How bad is it?

237
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,160
I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

238
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,400
Damn, man. You need to get
to a hospital, quick like.

239
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,800
ls this him?

240
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,440
Yeah, that's him.

241
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
What the fuck
you talkin' about, man?

242
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,680
I ain't never
seen this guy in my life.

243
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,200
I think this belongs to you.

244
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,280
Victor.

245
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,360
- Fuck.

246
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,480
Oh, God!

247
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,520
Come on, fuckin' bat!

248
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,080
Come on!
Look out for the gun!

249
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,560
Adios.

250
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,280
Fuck.

251
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,400
Boy, I'd sure like to do me...

252
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,280
one of them porno star bitches.

253
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,280
I did me one of them
porno star bitches once.

254
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,960
She had a small part
in Splendor in the Ass 2.

255
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,200
- You ever see that?
- No, I never saw it.

256
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,160
But I'd sure go rent it.
Which one is she?

257
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,800
She's in the scene
where Wendy West goes to the dentist.

258
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,880
There's this black
female dentist...

259
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,840
and a red-haired
dentist's helper.

260
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,840
I hammered the redhead.

261
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,680
What happened at the dentist's?

262
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,040
They all fuck each other.
What do you think? lt's a porno movie.

263
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,880
- I know this Mexican guy, Carlos.

264
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,320
He found out his sister
was doing porno in L.A.

265
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,600
So he waited till she was
doing another porno film...

266
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,520
and he went down to the set...

267
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,520
with a shotgun.

268
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,120
And he went completely crazy.

269
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,760
Carlos!

270
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,040
He shot the director.

271
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,720
- He shot the cameraman.

272
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,480
- No! No!

273
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,840
He shot the guy
who was drilling her.

274
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,400
And then...

275
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,720
he even shot the guy...

276
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,720
who brings the doughnuts.

277
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,400
Huh?

278
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,640
Man, this is just so cool, guys.

279
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,640
I mean, I'm gettin' to do
a big job with all my buddies.

280
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,600
- I mean, this is so great.
- Hey, Ray Bob.

281
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,440
Do you know who was asking about you?

282
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,480
- No, who?
- No one.

283
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,080
- Get off his ass, Jesus.

284
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,960
I ain't on his ass yet.

285
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,560
I ain't gonna have internal
squabbling on this deal.

286
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,960
- Where the hell you goin'?
- For a walk.

287
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:09,320
Yeah, well, don't stray too far.
Luther's due any time.

288
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,080
I bet you my ass he's going over
to that little senorita's room...

289
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,120
- to get his dick wet.
- Kind of figured Luther'd be here by now.

290
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,440
Luther.

291
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,520
What are you doing here?

292
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,040
I just dropped in
for a quick bite.

293
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,120
- What the fuck!

294
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,240
Take that, bitch!

295
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,160
No. No. No. No.

296
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,560
- Who is it?
- It's room service.

297
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,480
Open up, you idiots.

298
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,880
Look who l found.

299
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,440
Hot damn, Luther.

300
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,200
- I ain't seen you in a coon's age.
- C.W.

301
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,320
God Almighty, Luther. We thought
you was never even gonna show up.

302
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,400
I got dropped off
up the road a piece there.

303
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,720
Hoofed it the last mile or so.

304
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,560
Damn, Jesus.

305
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,680
That little split tail
drain the life out of you?

306
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,760
You look like a damn ghost.

307
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,800
She sucked me dry.

308
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,360
Damn.

309
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,080
Hey, Luther.

310
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,120
I just wanted to say I appreciate
you bringing me on this job and all.

311
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,560
All right, girls.
Gather 'round.

312
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,160
The bank's in Bravos,
right here near the border.

313
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,960
When you planning
on pulling this thing off?

314
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,080
- We'll be going on this
little expedition tonight.
- "Tonight"?

315
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,760
God dog, you gotta be kiddin' me.

316
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,560
We got to work things out.

317
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,560
Case the joint, shit like that.

318
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,840
Yeah, Luther, I never knowed you
to go into a deal half-cocked.

319
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,040
We're gonna do this thing my way...

320
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,440
which means we're gonna
do it tonight.

321
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,920
Or all of you are gonna
walk away with nothin'.

322
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,520
Are you homos in or are you out?

323
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,600
I'm in.

324
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,240
Well, I sure as hell ain't walkin' away
from 600 grand and change.

325
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,320
What's the big hurry, Luther?

326
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,240
What the hell are you?
Cinderella?

327
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,840
For one thing, that motel clerk
got a good look at me.

328
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,160
I think she might have made me.

329
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,680
Well, now, you might ought to have
mentioned that to me before.

330
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,000
Well, I'll fill you in
on a need-to-know basis.

331
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,920
Well, I need to know everything.

332
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,840
All right then.

333
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,400
From now on, Buck,
I'll tell you everything.

334
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,200
- Fair enough?
- Yeah.

335
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,040
Are you in or not?

336
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,080
I reckon I'm in.

337
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,080
All right then.

338
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,480
Let's head 'em up
and move 'em out!

339
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,640
What the hell
we need this stuff for?

340
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,640
I think it looks cool.

341
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,120
Just a precaution.

342
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,160
Looks like a goddamn bloodbath.

343
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,200
You tryin' to be funny?

344
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,160
No, sir.

345
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,240
Why don't you go on outside
and get some air?

346
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,160
Yeah.

347
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,600
What's his problem?

348
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,920
My boy's suffering
from some serious hurt.

349
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,280
Them Gecko brothers
killed his daddy.

350
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,240
- You remember old McGraw, don't you?
- Sure.

351
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,280
Sons of bitches shot
old Earl dead in the head.

352
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,360
What the hell
you figure happened here?

353
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,320
God only knows,
and He ain't talkin'.

354
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,520
Jesus, when you guys
are done unloading...

355
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,440
pull the car out in front
of the bank there.

356
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,480
In just a minute...

357
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,560
I'm gonna open this here door.

358
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,440
How the hell
are you gonna do that?

359
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,680
I done told you.

360
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,440
I got this thing all worked out, man.

361
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,600
God Almighty, Luther.

362
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,400
You'd think somebody had done and gone
give you the keys to the place.

363
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,960
What did you have
to kill the guard for?

364
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
It was him or me, Buck.

365
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,400
What about the other alarms?

366
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,720
There are a couple of motion detectors
back here by the safe.

367
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,720
You guys won't have
to worry about that.

368
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,600
C.W., crack this box.

369
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,320
Jesus Christ.

370
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,920
- All right, C.W.

371
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,280
Do your magic.
Don't touch nothin' you don't have to.

372
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,920
What's wrong, Luth?

373
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,200
A little asthma attack.
That's all. Let's go.

374
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,800
Yee-ha!

375
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,240
So far, so good, huh, Bucky?

376
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,720
I don't think so, Ray Bob.

377
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,840
We got us a dead guard here.

378
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:43,320
When them Mexicans catch us, they're
gonna fry our asses or hang us-- one.

379
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,240
Oh, man.

380
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,920
You're a goddamn artist, C.W.

381
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,080
- lt's an honor just watching you work.

382
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,200
Just let me know when you need
the lubricating oil.

383
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,360
What are you tryin' to do,
cornhole me?

384
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,440
Back off a little bit, Luther.
Give me a little room to work here.

385
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,000
And get this goddamn thing
out of the way.

386
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,560
- Luther, you all right?

387
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,600
Asthma, my ass.

388
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,720
I vote we get out of here
while we've still got a chance.

389
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,440
- Cops are on the way.
Let's get out of here.

390
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,280
- Damn it. All right,
time is still on our side.

391
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Now, all those cops can do
is slow us down a little bit.

392
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,480
- "Slow us down"?
Hell, they'll kill our asses.
- We ain't goin' anywhere.

393
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,640
C.W. has almost got this thing licked
now. You just settle your ass down.

394
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,200
- What are you, retarded?
Let's get out of here!
- Back off, man!

395
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,680
We're about to be millionaires.

396
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,080
We're gonna be dead millionaires,
we don't move it.

397
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,080
Get out of here
if you want to. l don't care.

398
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,880
Just leave more for us.

399
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Come on, Ray Bob,
let's get the hell out of here.

400
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,800
- What about the money, Bucky?
- It's over, Ray Bob.

401
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,200
There ain't gonna be no money.
Now, let's go.

402
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,040
You comin' with us?

403
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,960
I'll take my chances.

404
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,360
Well, you're as crazy
as they are.

405
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,800
- What do we do now, Bucky?

406
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,520
- Run!

407
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,000
- Man, they're everywhere.
- Shit!

408
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,000
- They're shootin' at us, Buck!
- Get back inside!

409
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:14,120
- You said we was gonna make it, Bucky.
- Shut up, Ray Bob!

410
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,800
Hey, I was just starting
to miss you guys.

411
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,040
Listen up, you idiots!

412
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,920
Get out of there and come out
with your hands up...

413
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,840
and we will not kill you.

414
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,440
I give you my word.

415
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,440
Take your time
and think it over.

416
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,560
You've got two minutes.

417
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,840
Ah, Jesus Christ!

418
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,360
Oh, God Almighty.

419
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,400
I don't know how many
of them are in there...

420
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,400
but your boy, Buck,
is one of them.

421
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,880
Well, I'll tell you
one thing, Chief.

422
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,600
You work pretty damn fast.

423
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,680
Hey, baby. I thought I told you
never to call me at work.

424
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,640
- This is Lawson here.
- Otis. Hey, how's your wife tasting?

425
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,320
None of your business,
you son of a bitch.

426
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,480
First off, who the hell are you,
and is Luther Heggs in there?

427
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,640
I'm Jesus, and, yeah,
Luther's here.

428
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,840
And Buck Bowers,
who you know intimately.

429
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,240
Then, goddamn it,
put Buck on.

430
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,240
You stupid bastard.

431
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,120
You're lucky I ain't done
put a bullet in your head.

432
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,960
Yeah?

433
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,440
Well, you cornholed
the pooch this time, boy.

434
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,280
Oh, I'd have to agree with you
on that one, Otis.

435
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,040
There is a bank guard in there
by the name of Reuben Salto Guitierrez.

436
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,960
We want to speak to him.

437
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:28,280
You got a bank guard in there by
the name of Reuben ""Salsa Goudaresm--""

438
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,520
H-H-How the hell you pronounce it?
Put him on the phone.

439
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,320
- I want to speak to him.
- Uh--

440
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,600
Well, he's still alive, isn't he?

441
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,720
Sure, he's fine.

442
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,440
Well, then put him on the phone.

443
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,840
Give me a minute.

444
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,760
Jesus... tell him
everything's okay in Mexican.

445
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,520
There you go.
Told you he's okay.

446
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,080
Now, listen up, Buck.
Let the guard go.

447
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,040
You guys come out
with your hands up high...

448
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,120
and we promise that
we ain't gonna kill you.

449
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,000
Well, now, Otis, l think
I'm gonna have to pass on that offer.

450
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:21,000
What about this:
We take the guard with us.

451
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,720
You give us a ten-minute head start,
and then we'll let him go.

452
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,840
- Ain't gonna happen, Bucko.
- Come on, Otis. Work with me here.

453
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,080
Now, the way l figure--

454
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,000
- Hello?
- What the hell are you doin', man?

455
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,360
- That was our last chance
to make a deal!
- There ain't gonna be no deals.

456
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,280
Besides, I'm tired of listening
to your chatter!

457
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,720
My pit ain't the only one
on the juice.

458
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,480
Come on, guys.
Hey, we ain't gotta fight, man.

459
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,760
- Yeah. End of the line, assholes!

460
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,680
- Goddamn it.

461
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,800
That's got it.

462
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,800
You the man, C.W.
You the man!

463
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,240
Good God, Gerty!
What a gorge!

464
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,880
We're right on schedule, buddy.

465
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,440
Got a half hour before sunrise.

466
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,960
- It's the fattest one l ever cracked.

467
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,720
I'll take care of that.
Get one of the guys back here
and bag up the rest of this cash.

468
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,080
What in God's name
is going on up there?

469
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,240
Get out of there!
Get out of there now, damn it!

470
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,120
- What the hell was that all about?
- God Almighty.

471
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,280
I think we're gonna have to make
a radical move here, Ray Bob.

472
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,880
Now, I know this sounds
totally insane...

473
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,440
but I think Luther, C.W.
and Jesus--

474
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,880
- What?
- Hey, look, if I don't go
take a leak right now...

475
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,800
I'm gonna piss in my pants.

476
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,080
Sal, can you see anything
on top of that bank?

477
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,560
I can't see anything up there.
Tear gas everywhere.

478
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,880
Sal? Come in, Sal.

479
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,600
- Sal?

480
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,600
- Sal?

481
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,640
Ray Bob, give me a hand
loading this green stuff.

482
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,640
Shit.

483
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,160
God Almighty.

484
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,080
Where did Luther get off to?

485
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,960
Uh, he's in the can.

486
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,080
Let's get this stuff loaded.

487
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,360
Let's get moving.
Cutting it pretty close.

488
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,000
All right, you assholes.

489
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,320
Get back here and give us
a hand loading this cash up.

490
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,880
Hell, yeah.

491
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:16,640
Jesus, I do believe you're the greediest
son of a bitch l ever knowed.

492
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,720
- Where's Buck at?

493
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,240
- Breathing down your neck.
- Take it back, Jesus.

494
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,920
You're the second greediest
son of a bitch l ever knowed.

495
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,240
lt's not about the money,
you stupid bastard.

496
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,040
Ray Bob, get over here.
You get away from them.

497
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,800
Don't you cocksuckers
move a muscle.

498
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,800
I want you to drop your guns
on the floor, and l want you
to kick 'em towards me.

499
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,440
Oh, Bucky, what are you doing?

500
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,280
They're vampires, Ray Bob.
I know that sounds fucked-up,
but that's what they are.

501
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,480
And we're getting the hell
out of here, Ray Bob.

502
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,840
Even going to the pen's
better than getting killed
by one of these bloodsuckers.

503
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,120
Buck, you paranoid
son of a bitch.

504
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,520
Now, Ray Bob, even you, dumb fuck that
you are, ain't buying into this, right?

505
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:05,080
Ray Bob, l wouldn't be willing
to go out there, if l didn't
know what was in here--

506
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,120
- Gettin' to you, boys. Get in there!

507
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,640
- Now!

508
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,200
Fuck.

509
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,600
Hey!

510
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,520
- Hey!

511
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,760
Bucky.

512
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,320
- Bucky.

513
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,720
Bucky.

514
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,960
- The doors!

515
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:20,880
I never thought
I'd be happy to see you bastards.

516
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,560
Do me a favor.

517
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,760
Take that knife
out of my leg.

518
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,880
Hold it.
You gotta listen to me.

519
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,280
You don't know what you're
dealing with in there.

520
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,280
-Get this piece of shit out of my sight.
-Otis, listen to me!

521
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,960
No, you listen to me! You had
your chance to talk, and you blew it.

522
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,280
Now, goddamn it, the game's over!
Get him in there.

523
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,160
I guarantee you it ain't over!
Otis, it ain't over!

524
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:52,440
- Otis, listen to me! Otis!

525
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,120
Otis, you gotta listen to me!
Otis!

526
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,200
- Let's do it.
- Otis!

527
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,600
- You don't know what it is in there!
- Go!

528
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,520
You don't know what's in there!

529
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,840
Goddamn it, Otis.
Now will you listen to me?

530
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,520
Let me out of the fucking car,
you asshole!

531
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:01,560
Ah, shit!
We're toast!

532
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,960
Otis, you got the sun!

533
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,360
What are you waitin' on, man?
Go in there and kill 'em!

534
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,400
I'm not sending any more men in there
to get slaughtered until l figure out...

535
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,320
what the hell it is
we're dealing with here.

536
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:25,360
Oh, you gotta be
fucking kidding me!

537
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,280
- Oh, shit!

538
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,760
- Come here, you sexy bitch.

539
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,040
You son of a bitch.
What the hell's going on here?

540
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:50,720
- They're making happy meals
out of our ass.
- They're goddamn vampires, Otis!

541
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,760
All right, suppose they are.
What can we do about it?

542
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,560
- I think l know a way
we can take 'em out.
- Tell me.

543
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:03,080
- You gotta uncuff me first.
- Well, you tell me,
and we'll take 'em out.

544
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,920
Get these cuffs off me now!

545
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,200
- Fuck you. Come on, kid.
- Otis!

546
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,920
- Fuck you.
- You take these cuffs off me, Otis!

547
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,680
Otis!
Get these cuffs off me!

548
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,040
No!

549
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,720
All right, let's hear it.
And this better be good.

550
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:57,960
You ain't hearing nothin'
until you get these cuffs off of me.

551
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,480
Looks like it's
just about over, Otis.

552
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,880
Looks like you might
be right, Luther.

553
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:25,840
- Take that, you cocksucker.

554
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,240
We'll take care of these pussies.

555
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,560
Get the car loaded up.

556
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,280
l was just gettin' the car ready.

557
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:59,720
If you weren't already dead,
I'd kill your ass.

558
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:14,000
- That's for the kid.

559
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,880
Time to come with us, Buck.

560
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:38,680
- The bite ain't that bad.
- Bite my ass.

561
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:42,120
This is no time
for long good-byes, asshole.

562
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:55,560
- Yeah!

563
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,760
- Oh, man!

564
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,480
- Boo!
- Shit!

565
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,640
Otis!

566
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:00,840
- Fuck, your luck's done
run out, Luther.

567
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,120
Let's get the hell out of here
while we still got some dark left.

568
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:01,160
You just don't ever give up,
do you, Bucky? l admire that.

569
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:11,040
- Couldn't just go along
with the program, could you?

570
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:15,080
- You had to be a hero!

571
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,560
Had to play the old,
tough cowboy, huh?

572
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:21,040
- You had to fuck everything up,
didn't you?

573
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,720
- What's wrong, tough guy?

574
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,000
Happy trails!

575
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,240
- How you feeling now, Bucky?
- Fuck.

576
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,680
Jesus!

577
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,320
You about gave me
a heart attack, Otis.

578
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,200
Yeah.

579
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,720
Nice shades.

580
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:10,160
We're the goddamn fearless
vampire killers, ain't we, Otis?

581
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:17,560
Yeah, too bad there ain't much call
for that kind of work.

582
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,440
Yeah, l don't imagine.

583
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:28,400
Tell me something, Buck.

584
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:33,200
What in the hell are vampires
doing robbing a bank?

585
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,840
You got me.

586
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:40,400
I suppose vampires need money
just like anybody else.

587
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,080
I guess.

588
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,480
Nope.
Gave 'em up.

589
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,000
Use one of those patches?

590
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,720
- No. Cold turkey.
- Goddamn.

591
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,920
- You ever miss 'em?
- Aw...

592
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,400
every once in a while.

593
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:04,920
After a good, hot cup of coffee...

594
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:08,760
after a good meal and...
a good, hard fuck...

595
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,760
but... not too often.

596
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,360
Well, I think l might have
to make a run for it, Otis.

597
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,720
l ain't never done too good
locked up in one of them cages.

598
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,480
Spent too much of my life
like that already.

599
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,120
Well, I suppose l ought
to try and stop you.

600
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:36,880
I don't think you're
in no shape to stop nobody.

601
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,600
- I don't imagine you're gonna make it.

602
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:51,440
Maybe.
Maybe not
