1
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:24,891
Fly me to the moon

2
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:29,986
Let me
play among the stars

3
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:33,328
Let me see
what spring is like

4
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:34,278
On Jupiter and Mars

5
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,306
In other words

6
00:00:41,306 --> 00:00:44,845
Hold my hand

7
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,549
In other words

8
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,914
Baby, kiss me

9
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,451
Fill my heart with song

10
00:00:57,451 --> 00:01:02,825
And let me sing forevermore

11
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:05,865
You are all I long for

12
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:10,903
All I worship and adore

13
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:13,701
In other words

14
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:16,299
Please be true

15
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,446
In other words

16
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:24,484
I love you

17
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:03,049
Fill my heart with song

18
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:05,853
Let me sing forevermore

19
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:11,492
You are all I long for

20
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:16,161
All I worship and adore

21
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:17,495
In other words

22
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:18,936
Excuse me.

23
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:20,563
Excuse me.

24
00:02:20,563 --> 00:02:24,474
Please be true

25
00:02:24,474 --> 00:02:27,570
In other words

26
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:32,148
In other words

27
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:33,437
I

28
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:36,089
Love

29
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,092
Good morning.
Jackson-Steinem.

30
00:02:41,092 --> 00:02:42,423
You

31
00:02:42,423 --> 00:02:43,827
How you doing, Buddy?

32
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:46,957
Doing any better,
it'd be a sin.

33
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:50,636
Good morning.

34
00:02:58,712 --> 00:02:59,974
Good morning, Dan.

35
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:01,775
What's looking
good today?

36
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:04,942
If I knew, I wouldn't
be in this business.

37
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:06,519
Get out while
you're young, kid.

38
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,555
I came here one day
and look at me now.

39
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:12,558
Ah, look at you now.

40
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:13,957
Good morning, Brian.

41
00:03:13,957 --> 00:03:15,926
Chuckie!
How's the woman slayer?

42
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:18,965
Still looking for the right
18-year-old wife.

43
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,556
How you doing, pal?

44
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:22,966
If I had your looks, better.

45
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:26,005
Takes genetics, education,
and the right tailor.

46
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,098
Not that you learned anything.

47
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:32,974
Marv, I got a feeling
we'll make a killing today.

48
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:35,548
Oh, yeah?
Where's your machine gun?

49
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,982
Jesus, you can't make
a buck in this market.

50
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:41,577
The country's
going to hell faster

51
00:03:41,577 --> 00:03:44,021
than when Roosevelt
was in charge.

52
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:45,558
Too much
cheap money.

53
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,594
Worst mistake was getting off
the gold standard.

54
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:51,563
Putney Drug. You might want
to look at it.

55
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:54,998
No. Take five years for that company
to come around.

56
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:58,037
But they got
a good new drug.

57
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,867
Stick to the fundamentals.

58
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:02,807
That's how I BM
and Hilton were built.

59
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,068
Good things
sometimes take time.

60
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:07,545
<i>Look sharp today,
especially you rookies.</i>

61
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:10,981
<i>The Nikkei Index closed
up 90 points last night.</i>

62
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:13,952
<i>We expect heavyJapanese
buying on the opening.</i>

63
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,955
<i>Get on the horn
with your institution.</i>

64
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:18,854
<i>Report on their appetite.</i>

65
00:04:18,854 --> 00:04:21,291
<i>Utilities are
our top priority today.</i>

66
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,120
<i>O.K., let's go to work!</i>

67
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,198
And they're off and running!

68
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:37,307
Can we check that
for you?

69
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:38,602
10,000...

70
00:04:38,602 --> 00:04:40,145
I can confirm that.

71
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:42,078
We cleared up to 60,000...

72
00:04:42,078 --> 00:04:43,649
G.C. At 481/2.

73
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:45,651
Yes, that's right.

74
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:48,119
10,000. Right.

75
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:51,723
The market just opened.

76
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:53,759
What are you
talking about?

77
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,158
Here's a hot lead.

78
00:04:55,158 --> 00:04:58,197
Research just put thrifts
on the recommended.

79
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,733
Yeah! Dump them,
for Christ's sake!

80
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,631
Jack, 30,000. 38 top.

81
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:05,603
I'd go long at 23.
You got it.

82
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:07,868
Now you own it.

83
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:09,567
Conwest Air?
Let me check.

84
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,239
10,000 at the 1/4.
That's Industrial Oil...

85
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:16,908
29,000 Niagaras
for Templeton!

86
00:05:16,908 --> 00:05:20,612
We are in the middle
of the biggest bull market

87
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,656
our generation
or any other ever witnessed.

88
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,887
Sir, if you'd take
five minutes of your time...

89
00:05:26,887 --> 00:05:29,929
Looking for 50,000 Con Air!
What do you got?

90
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:33,261
September?
How about those Decembers?

91
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:34,299
Bud Fox,
Jackson-Steinem.

92
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:37,165
If I could have
five minutes of your time

93
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:39,296
to explain the extraordinary
opportunities

94
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:42,068
emerging in the
international debt market...

95
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:44,201
I know all about it.

96
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:45,869
Bud Fox, Jackson-Steinem.

97
00:05:45,869 --> 00:05:49,039
If I could have
five minutes of your time

98
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,640
to explain the extraordinary
opportunities

99
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,051
emerging in the
international debt market...

100
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,179
I'm sure that, uh...

101
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,199
<i>It concerns my future!</i>

102
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,962
I need the information now,
before the close!

103
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:13,130
In 10 minutes, it's history!
At 4:00, I'm a dinosaur!

104
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,767
Sure, it's gone down,
but you got the tip, I didn't.

105
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:20,005
I didn't tell you to buy it.
Why would I tell you to sell it?

106
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,049
I can't give it back.
You own it!

107
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,607
He's not here right now.

108
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:28,051
That's what
you told us to say.

109
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:29,749
Give me that phone.

110
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:30,824
Hello?

111
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:33,290
Hello. This is the sales manager.

112
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,885
What seems to be
the problem?

113
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:37,362
Give me a break!

114
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:39,193
How was I
supposed to know

115
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:40,857
you were in surgery!

116
00:06:40,857 --> 00:06:43,232
Want me to pull
my account?

117
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:44,804
No, sir.

118
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,635
I'll discuss that
with the account executive.

119
00:06:47,635 --> 00:06:49,265
You're welcome.

120
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:53,204
I'm closing
the account out.

121
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,113
If he doesn't pay tomorrow,
you pay.

122
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:59,413
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you
he's lying!

123
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,416
We give you one of those
rich man's accounts.

124
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:06,084
You tell me he'll D.K. You
for a Lousy 1/4 point?

125
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:10,357
You know he's got a history
of this kind of bullshit!

126
00:07:10,357 --> 00:07:13,228
Somebody's got to pay.
Ain't going to be me.

127
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,130
Little trouble today, Buddy?

128
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,729
Howard the jerk
reneged on me.

129
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:24,437
I've got to cover his losses
to the tune of about seven grand!

130
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,008
Yeah, I'm holding.

131
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:27,444
I'm tapped out, Marv.

132
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:31,143
American Express has
a hit man looking for me.

133
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:32,741
Well, could have been worse.

134
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:34,788
Could have been my money.

135
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,448
Here, here, rookie,
let me help you out.

136
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:40,425
What do I got?
A C-note.

137
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:44,019
Thanks, Marv.
I'll make it up to you.

138
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:46,031
Yes, I am still here!

139
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:48,499
You know
what my dream is?

140
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,431
To be on the other end
of that phone.

141
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:54,473
You got it!
Where the real cheesecake is.

142
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:56,441
Bud, you forgetting something?

143
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:58,375
The Gekko phone call!

144
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,471
Buddy, when are
you going to realize

145
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,943
big game hunters
bag the elephants,

146
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:05,416
not guys like us.

147
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:07,043
Gordon Gekko, please.

148
00:08:07,043 --> 00:08:10,248
<i>30 seconds after
the Challenger blew up,</i>

149
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:12,291
Gekko's selling
NASA stock short!

150
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,295
Yeah, but he made 23
on the Imperial deal before he was 40.

151
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:20,196
The guy makes 20 times
what Dave Winfield makes in a year,

152
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:22,268
<i>and he talks
to everybody.</i>

153
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:25,338
<i>And he had
an ethical by-pass at birth!</i>

154
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,031
Hello, Natalie?
Guess who?

155
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:28,437
Mr. Fox.

156
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:30,009
That's right.

157
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,307
Every day I tell myself,
"today could be the day."

158
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:34,903
Will you marry me?

159
00:08:34,903 --> 00:08:37,449
- I'll think about it.
- That's terrible.

160
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:40,145
Please get me through
to Mr. Gekko.

161
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,745
Five minutes,
that's all I'm asking.

162
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:45,757
Mr. Fox,
I'm sure you're a good broker,

163
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:48,794
but our traders
deal with the brokers.

164
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,490
Mr. Gekko only deals
with investment bankers.

165
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,032
Tell him I called.

166
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,500
There are big changes
in the international debt market.

167
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,435
Leo, I understand,

168
00:08:58,435 --> 00:09:02,532
but you have to realize there'll
be major subordinated debt involved.

169
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,550
Buddy boy,
how you doing?

170
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,421
Great, Charlie.
Any better would be a sin.

171
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:22,427
I hear all wall street guys
are millionaires.

172
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:25,293
When you gonna
make us all rich?

173
00:09:25,293 --> 00:09:27,026
Give me 50 grand,

174
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:30,035
I'll get you a condo in Florida
next Christmas.

175
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:32,435
Sure! We'll own
the airline by then!

176
00:09:32,435 --> 00:09:34,439
Let him make himself rich

177
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:36,372
so he can pay off
his school loans.

178
00:09:36,372 --> 00:09:38,377
Nice to see you're
in such a good mood.

179
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:41,504
What did mom give you
fish for dinner?

180
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:43,105
You're smoking too much.

181
00:09:43,105 --> 00:09:45,446
How many times
you gotta go to the hospital...

182
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:50,046
Leave me alone. It's the only thing
that makes me feel good.

183
00:09:50,046 --> 00:09:52,489
Your mother still
makes lousy spaghetti.

184
00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:55,494
It's called pasta now.
Spaghetti's out-of-date.

185
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:58,258
So am I.
You want a beer?

186
00:09:58,258 --> 00:09:59,492
Yeah.

187
00:09:59,492 --> 00:10:02,091
A Molson Light
for the kid!

188
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:03,500
He's looking good.

189
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,071
He looks terrific.

190
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,470
Carl, we'll be at the bar.

191
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,201
Nice seeing you, Buddy.

192
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:10,901
Take care.

193
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,380
You look like
you've grown another inch,

194
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,212
but you don't look so hot,
Buddy.

195
00:10:18,212 --> 00:10:22,277
Starting to get bags under your eyes
like your old man.

196
00:10:22,277 --> 00:10:24,414
I had a tough day.

197
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:27,652
Some jerk D.K. Ed me.
I got to cover his losses.

198
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,259
Speak English.

199
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:32,059
<i>D.K. Didn't know
who I was</i>

200
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:35,100
when the options he bought
took a bath.

201
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,500
I warned you
about that racket.

202
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,505
You could have been
a doctor or lawyer.

203
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:43,098
If you'd stayed
at Bluestar,

204
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:46,509
you could have been a supervisor
instead of a salesman.

205
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:49,013
I am not a salesman,
I'm an account executive.

206
00:10:49,013 --> 00:10:51,949
Soon I'll be
in the investment banking side.

207
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:54,043
You ask strangers
for money,

208
00:10:54,043 --> 00:10:55,416
you're a salesman.

209
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,513
I'm building
a client list!

210
00:10:57,513 --> 00:11:01,116
I could make more money
in one year as a broker

211
00:11:01,116 --> 00:11:04,493
than I could in five years
at this airline.

212
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:07,294
You borrow money
to go to NYU.

213
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:09,631
You made 50 grand
last year.

214
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:12,672
You still can't
pay off your loans!

215
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:16,568
50K doesn't get you to first base
in the Big Apple.

216
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:19,475
40% in taxes,
15 grand for rent,

217
00:11:19,475 --> 00:11:21,446
parking,
three bills a month,

218
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:24,016
good suits
400 bucks a pop...

219
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,075
Live rent-free
at home.

220
00:11:26,075 --> 00:11:30,020
$50,000! Jesus Christ!
The whole world's off its rocker!

221
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,183
I made a total
of $47,000 last year.

222
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:35,557
That's before taxes.

223
00:11:35,557 --> 00:11:38,256
That's Queens!
A 5% mortgage

224
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:40,697
<i>And you rent the top room!</i>

225
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:44,164
I got to live in Manhattan
to be a player.

226
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:46,466
There's no nobility
in poverty anymore.

227
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:49,337
One day you'll be
proud of me.

228
00:11:49,337 --> 00:11:53,311
It's yourself you got to be proud of,
huckleberry.

229
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:54,937
How much you need?

230
00:11:54,937 --> 00:11:56,606
Can you spare 300?

231
00:11:56,606 --> 00:12:00,585
I don't know if
I got that much on me.

232
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:02,587
Not in here, please.

233
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,588
It adds up.

234
00:12:05,588 --> 00:12:08,183
You know 300 here,
200 there.

235
00:12:08,183 --> 00:12:10,559
Well, money's only
something you need

236
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,098
in case
you don't die tomorrow.

237
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:14,599
How you doing?

238
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,566
How's work
been treating you?

239
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:20,128
Damn mandatory drug tests
are driving my men crazy.

240
00:12:20,128 --> 00:12:21,673
The only good news is

241
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:25,711
we had a meeting with the controller
about union business,

242
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,269
and guess what.

243
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:31,146
Remember the accident last year
and the investigation?

244
00:12:31,146 --> 00:12:35,278
The FAA is going to rule
it was a manufacturing error.

245
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:37,549
I told them
it wasn't maintenance.

246
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:42,617
It's those god damned
greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati.

247
00:12:42,617 --> 00:12:44,026
That's great, Dad.

248
00:12:44,026 --> 00:12:45,564
We'll be out of suspension.

249
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:49,192
We can get new routes to Pittsburgh
and Boston now.

250
00:12:49,192 --> 00:12:51,737
We'll compete
with the big guys.

251
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,601
Well, to Bluestar.

252
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:55,197
As your broker,

253
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:58,641
I advise that you hold on
to that stock.

254
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:00,577
What stock?
Are you kidding?

255
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:02,581
You sure
about this thing?

256
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:03,581
What?

257
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:05,174
The FAA
announcement.

258
00:13:05,174 --> 00:13:06,684
Sure I'm sure.

259
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:08,584
Look at me.

260
00:13:08,584 --> 00:13:12,021
You've got that mischievous look
in your eye, Buddy.

261
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:16,687
You used to smile like that
when you were a kid sleeping.

262
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:19,732
It's true,
just like that.

263
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,468
Morning, Gordon.

264
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,150
There's a delivery
for Mr. Gekko.

265
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,153
He needs your signature.

266
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:16,847
Send him in.

267
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:31,571
Hello, Natalie.
Recognize the voice?

268
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,572
I'll give you a hint.

269
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,903
You're seriously
considering marrying me.

270
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,541
You're lovelier
than I pictured.

271
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,635
I have Mr. Gekko's
birthday present.

272
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:41,543
You can't come barging in,

273
00:14:41,543 --> 00:14:44,708
and what makes you think
it's his birthday?

274
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,752
It's in the bible, see?

275
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,378
You better buy him a gift.

276
00:14:49,378 --> 00:14:52,425
Please, Natalie,
let me give this to him.

277
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,392
Cuban cigars.
Davidoff, his favorite,

278
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:57,259
and very tough to get.

279
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:00,697
Please, Natalie.

280
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:03,633
Stay here.
I'll see what I can do.

281
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,913
Wait outside.

282
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,893
Yeah, I'll see you shortly.
I hope.

283
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,502
Five minutes.

284
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:53,785
Well, life all comes down
to a few moments.

285
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,912
This is one of them.

286
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,326
What the hell's going on?

287
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,759
I'm looking at
200,000 shares move.

288
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,727
Are we part of it?

289
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:06,321
We'd better be,

290
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:09,630
or I'm going to eat your lunch
for you.

291
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,294
Sorry, Jeff.

292
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:14,669
I loved it at 40.
It's insulting at 50.

293
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:16,732
Their analysts don't know

294
00:16:16,732 --> 00:16:18,743
preferred stock
from livestock.

295
00:16:18,743 --> 00:16:22,713
When it heads south,
we raise the sperm count.

296
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:26,752
This is the kid who calls 59 days
in a row,

297
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,480
wants to be a player.

298
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,818
Should be a picture of you

299
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:32,789
in the dictionary under
"persistence."

300
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:34,757
I'm looking for
negative control,

301
00:16:34,757 --> 00:16:36,761
no more than
30%, 35%,

302
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:39,331
enough to block
any merger plans

303
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,367
and find out
if the books are cooked.

304
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:46,838
If it looks good on paper,
we're in the kill zone.

305
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,771
Lunch? Lunch is for wimps.

306
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:50,866
Billy,
I'll talk at you.

307
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:55,780
I'm Bud Fox.

308
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,373
So you say.
Nice meeting you.

309
00:16:58,373 --> 00:17:00,316
I hope
you're intelligent.

310
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:02,355
Where did you
get these?

311
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,582
An airport connection.

312
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:06,318
So, what's on
your mind, kemo sabe?

313
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,757
Why am I
listening to you?

314
00:17:07,757 --> 00:17:10,762
I've got to monitor
my blood pressure,

315
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:13,025
so don't upset me.

316
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:14,361
No, no, sir.

317
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:15,731
Within 45 seconds,

318
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:17,735
the microprocessor
computes your systolic

319
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:19,361
and diastolic
pressure.

320
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:22,340
Got an LCD readout.
Cost effective,

321
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,843
less than one visit
to a doctor.

322
00:17:25,843 --> 00:17:28,379
I want to let you know

323
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:31,348
that I've read about you
at NYU business.

324
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:32,782
I think you're
an incredible genius.

325
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:36,583
I've dreamed of doing business
with a man like you.

326
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,782
What firm you with, pal?

327
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:40,359
Jackson-Steinem.

328
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,396
They're going places,
good junk bond department.

329
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,522
You're financing
thatJanson investment?

330
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,758
Yeah.

331
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:49,357
We're working on
some interesting stuff.

332
00:17:49,357 --> 00:17:51,734
Cosmetic company,
by any chance?

333
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:54,864
Are you 12th man
on the deal team?

334
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:57,772
I can't tell you that,
Mr. Gekko.

335
00:17:57,772 --> 00:17:59,777
Why are you here?

336
00:17:59,777 --> 00:18:02,347
Chart break out
on Whitewood-Young.

337
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,383
30% discount
from the book.

338
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,315
Couple of 5% holders.

339
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:07,909
It's a dog.

340
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:09,318
Very strong management.

341
00:18:09,318 --> 00:18:10,616
It's a dog.

342
00:18:10,616 --> 00:18:12,987
What else you got?

343
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:15,891
Mr. Stevenson
in San Francisco.

344
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,767
He respond
to the offer?

345
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,359
What?

346
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,767
He's in Chicago.

347
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:27,773
What is Cromwell doing
giving a lecture tour

348
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,775
when he's losing
60 million a quarter?

349
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:33,779
He must give lectures
on losing money.

350
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,783
If he owned a funeral parlor,
no one would die.

351
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,784
This turkey's
totally brain dead!

352
00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:42,822
Christmas is over,
and business is business.

353
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,380
Dilute the son of a bitch!

354
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,394
I want every orifice
in his fucking body flowing red.

355
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:50,827
He's flowing, Gordo.

356
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:54,388
This guy's the best trader
on the streets.

357
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:58,403
Susan, get me the LBO analysis
on Teldar Paper, please.

358
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,166
<i>Mr. Gekko,
your wife.</i>

359
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,533
What else?
What else you got?

360
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:05,475
Tarafly.
Analysts don't like it,

361
00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:07,172
I do.

362
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:10,382
The breakup value
is twice the market price.

363
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,745
Sell two divisions...

364
00:19:11,745 --> 00:19:15,446
Not bad, but that's a dog
with different fleas.

365
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,749
Come on, pal.

366
00:19:16,749 --> 00:19:19,154
Tell me something
I don't know.

367
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,790
It's my birthday.

368
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,156
Surprise me.

369
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,197
Bluestar.

370
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:29,196
What?

371
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,164
Bluestar Airlines.

372
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,769
Rings a bell somewhere.
So what?

373
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:35,204
It's a comer.

374
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,204
80 medium-body jets,

375
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:40,173
300 pilots,
flies Florida...

376
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,209
Canada, uh,
Northeast, Caribbean,

377
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,916
great slots
in major cities.

378
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,213
I don't like airlines.
Lousy unions.

379
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,785
There was a crash
last year.

380
00:19:49,785 --> 00:19:53,222
They just got a favorable ruling
on a lawsuit.

381
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,450
Even the plaintiffs
don't know.

382
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,156
How do you
know about it?

383
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,198
I just know.

384
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,832
The decision should
clear the way

385
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:05,234
for new planes
and route contracts.

386
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,530
There's only a small float.

387
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,801
Good for a five-point pop.

388
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:13,709
Just got 250,000 shares
at 181/4 from Janson.

389
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:16,578
I can pull twice that
from California pensions.

390
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:18,981
We're near
half a million shares.

391
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:20,677
Huh? The terminator!

392
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,551
Blow them away, Ollie!

393
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:26,056
I think we've got
the Beezer brothers coming in.

394
00:20:26,056 --> 00:20:28,025
I'm working on
the Silverbergs.

395
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:30,027
Rip their fucking
throats out!

396
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:32,587
Stuff them in
your garbage compactor!

397
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:34,030
Got a card?

398
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,896
Home number's
on the back.

399
00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:39,598
Bud Fox,
I look at 100 deals a day.

400
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:41,037
I choose one.

401
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:43,608
I hope to hear
from you.

402
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:45,644
Thanks for the cigars.

403
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,043
We're going over 5% in Teldar.

404
00:20:48,043 --> 00:20:51,605
Start the lawyers
on a tender offer at 13D.

405
00:20:51,605 --> 00:20:53,652
We don't pay over 22.

406
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,050
They will fight.

407
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,748
Myers and Thromburg
are doing their legal.

408
00:20:57,748 --> 00:20:59,654
Thanks, Natalie.

409
00:20:59,654 --> 00:21:01,989
Have a nice day,
Mr. Fox.

410
00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:04,029
Your conference call
is ready.

411
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,997
Mr. Sugarman
and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware,

412
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:09,898
Mr. Jackson
and Ms. Roscoe in London.

413
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:13,605
But, please, I'm begging you.
I'm in a bind.

414
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,665
I've got all these
damn new computers,

415
00:21:16,665 --> 00:21:20,109
and young men
are edging me out of here.

416
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:22,670
Hey, Bud,
did he see you?

417
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,148
Yeah, he saw right through me.

418
00:21:25,148 --> 00:21:26,685
Cheer up, Buddy,

419
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,118
You shook Gekko
the great's hand,

420
00:21:29,118 --> 00:21:31,656
and you still
got your fingers.

421
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:34,192
Did you get something
from him?

422
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,989
Teldar Paper, huh?

423
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:40,122
Nah. It's a dog with fleas.

424
00:21:40,122 --> 00:21:41,291
Fox.

425
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,730
Where have you been
for the last three hours?

426
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,702
If I were you,

427
00:21:46,702 --> 00:21:49,707
and I thank
my personal god I'm not,

428
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:51,709
I wouldn't be
chin-wagging.

429
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:56,839
Plenty of six-figure names
in that zip code file to cold call.

430
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:00,219
Aagh!

431
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:02,686
Got tickets
for the Knick game.

432
00:22:02,686 --> 00:22:05,690
Cruise some chicks afterwards,
what do you say?

433
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,749
I've got charts
to read.

434
00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:09,657
Come on.
Forget charts.

435
00:22:09,657 --> 00:22:13,129
We're not fund managers.
Churn them and burn them.

436
00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:15,257
I'm offering
the Knicks and chicks.

437
00:22:15,257 --> 00:22:19,828
God help you before you turn in
to poor Steeples there.

438
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:22,970
Preferably
Lou Mannheim.

439
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,102
Nice guy, swell fella,
but he's a loser.

440
00:22:26,102 --> 00:22:29,613
He lost all his equity
in the '71 recession.

441
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:33,117
You want to be pitching
in your late 60s?

442
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:35,983
Whatever happened
to that cute analyst,

443
00:22:35,983 --> 00:22:36,987
Sidney, Susan?

444
00:22:36,987 --> 00:22:37,988
Cindy.

445
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:39,353
Sex with her

446
00:22:39,353 --> 00:22:41,723
<i>was like reading
The Wall StreetJournal.</i>

447
00:22:41,723 --> 00:22:43,693
She had a heartbeat.

448
00:22:43,693 --> 00:22:46,732
I've got to get to work.
Zs today.

449
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,858
Call for you, Buddy!

450
00:22:48,858 --> 00:22:50,196
Pick up two.

451
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,636
Bud Fox.

452
00:22:53,636 --> 00:22:55,708
All right, Bud Fox,

453
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:59,176
I want you to buy 20,000 shares
of Bluestar

454
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:02,112
at 151/8th...

455
00:23:02,112 --> 00:23:04,080
3/8ths tops,

456
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,084
and don't
screw it up, sport.

457
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:09,051
Think you can
handle that?

458
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:11,123
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

459
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,089
You won't regret this.

460
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:14,124
Wooo!

461
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:16,957
Marv, I just
bagged the elephant!

462
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,059
Gekko.

463
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,756
Hiya, sport.

464
00:23:54,756 --> 00:23:57,803
Nice to see you again,
Mr. Gekko.

465
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,769
Try the steak tartare.

466
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:02,103
Louis will
make it for you.

467
00:24:02,103 --> 00:24:03,698
Anything to drink?

468
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:05,710
Just an Evian, please.

469
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,279
Hey! See this?

470
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,712
Can you believe it,
a 2-inch screen?

471
00:24:09,712 --> 00:24:11,750
I can hardly see it.

472
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,682
It's for my kid Rudy.

473
00:24:13,682 --> 00:24:16,687
3 years old,
he's an electronics freak.

474
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:19,724
We're going
to a new age, pal.

475
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:20,690
Check.

476
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,727
So how's
business today?

477
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:23,818
Great.

478
00:24:23,818 --> 00:24:27,161
Bluestar was at 171/4
when I left the office.

479
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:29,724
Might hit 18 by the bell.

480
00:24:29,724 --> 00:24:31,133
Teldar's shooting up.

481
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:33,138
Buy any for yourself?

482
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,505
I bet you did
as soon as you left.

483
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:40,972
No, sir, that wouldn't
have been legal.

484
00:24:40,972 --> 00:24:42,708
Sure.

485
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,146
Relax, pal,

486
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:47,744
no one's going
to blow the whistle on you.

487
00:24:47,744 --> 00:24:48,912
Is that legal?

488
00:24:48,912 --> 00:24:51,114
Put that in my account.

489
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,714
Hey, Gordon.

490
00:24:52,714 --> 00:24:55,487
Georgie, the cellular king,
how you been?

491
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:57,722
It's nice to see you.

492
00:24:57,722 --> 00:24:59,923
Oh, Gordon,
you look wonderful.

493
00:24:59,923 --> 00:25:02,125
You're looking
very well yourself.

494
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,533
And Mr. Davis.

495
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,534
Can I get the check here, please,

496
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,138
for Christ's sakes!

497
00:25:09,138 --> 00:25:11,142
Cover that Bluestar buy.

498
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,144
Put a couple hundred thou

499
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,113
on those bow-wow stocks
you mentioned.

500
00:25:16,113 --> 00:25:19,514
Use a stop loss so your downside
is 100 thou,

501
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,753
and buy a decent suit.

502
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:24,550
You can't come in here
looking like this.

503
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:28,123
Go to Morty Sills.
Tell him I sent you.

504
00:25:28,123 --> 00:25:29,524
Yes, sir.

505
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:32,821
Thank you for the chance.
You're with a winner.

506
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:35,127
Right, right.

507
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:38,135
Put the rest
in a mutual fund.

508
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:42,173
I want to see how you do
before investing it.

509
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,209
Save the cheap
salesman talk.

510
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,869
Excuse me, sir?

511
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:47,572
You heard me.

512
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:49,542
I don't like losses, sport.

513
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:52,579
Nothing ruins my day
more than losses.

514
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:55,286
You do good,
you get perks,

515
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:58,186
Lots and lots of perks.

516
00:25:58,186 --> 00:25:59,280
Louis.

517
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,087
Yes, sir.

518
00:26:01,087 --> 00:26:03,093
Take care of my friend.

519
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:05,561
Have a good lunch, Buddy.

520
00:26:05,561 --> 00:26:08,600
Hi, Richard.
How are you?

521
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,233
Congratulations.

522
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,558
Hi, Bud.

523
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:40,564
Hi.

524
00:26:40,564 --> 00:26:42,123
I'm Lisa...

525
00:26:42,123 --> 00:26:44,361
a friend of Gordon's.

526
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,138
Lisa? Gordon?

527
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,366
Oh, oh,
Mr. Gekko, sure.

528
00:26:49,366 --> 00:26:53,070
Uh, would you
like to come in?

529
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,079
Didn't he tell you?

530
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:58,514
Oh, that's
so like Gordon.

531
00:26:58,514 --> 00:27:01,052
Why don't you
get dressed?

532
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,643
We're going out.

533
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:04,389
We are?

534
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:05,479
Mmm.

535
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,040
Let me see.

536
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,508
So, where are we going?

537
00:27:25,508 --> 00:27:28,046
Wherever you like.

538
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:32,481
Lutece, 21,
the River Cafe...

539
00:27:32,481 --> 00:27:38,183
or maybe we could just
drive around for a while...

540
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:43,061
work up an appetite.

541
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:47,495
Want some?

542
00:27:47,495 --> 00:27:48,624
Sure.

543
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:56,608
Gordon tells me that you're a very
talented broker.

544
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,010
What do you like?

545
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,377
Like? Well...

546
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:05,450
This guy who should know

547
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,042
tells me to buy
Hewlett-Packard,

548
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:10,486
but I've been burned
on tips.

549
00:28:10,486 --> 00:28:13,047
Um, Hewlett,
well, let's see...

550
00:28:13,047 --> 00:28:15,184
it closed at 411/4,

551
00:28:15,184 --> 00:28:16,488
up 1/8.

552
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:18,426
Very attractive.

553
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:20,055
Uh-huh.

554
00:28:20,055 --> 00:28:22,066
About average yield.

555
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:23,499
Very attractive.

556
00:28:23,499 --> 00:28:24,694
Mmm.

557
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,303
Rising profits,
strong balance sheet.

558
00:28:28,303 --> 00:28:31,069
You're hot
on this stock.

559
00:28:31,069 --> 00:28:32,542
Uh...

560
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:34,545
it's ready
to take off.

561
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:39,209
I'd jump all over it
if I were you.

562
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:41,582
Good morning, Carolyn.

563
00:28:41,582 --> 00:28:43,621
Morning, Buddy.
You look happy.

564
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:46,214
Any better
and I'd be guilty.

565
00:28:46,214 --> 00:28:48,192
You were never
that innocent.

566
00:28:48,192 --> 00:28:50,694
How do you know?
You wish.

567
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:31,634
Taken in again

568
00:29:31,634 --> 00:29:33,204
Again, again

569
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,772
Taken in again

570
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,234
Well, no, no, no, no

571
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:37,274
We can ask
the government

572
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:38,503
Not the people

573
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:40,410
Taken in again

574
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,707
Again, again

575
00:29:41,707 --> 00:29:43,179
Taken in again

576
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:46,080
I mean, what... what
are you going to do?

577
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,114
America is waiting
for a message

578
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:51,621
Of some sort
or another...

579
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,636
God damn!

580
00:30:07,636 --> 00:30:11,164
We went down the toilet
on that ugly bitch.

581
00:30:11,164 --> 00:30:12,141
Buddy!

582
00:30:12,141 --> 00:30:14,075
Mr. Gekko's
looking for you.

583
00:30:14,075 --> 00:30:17,343
Be at the Wyatt Club Courts
at 6:00.

584
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:23,746
Aah!

585
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:26,748
Aah!

586
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:29,622
Come on, sport.

587
00:30:29,622 --> 00:30:31,788
You've got to try harder.

588
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,627
You need exercise,
for christ's sake.

589
00:30:34,627 --> 00:30:37,725
I don't think
I can go on, Mr. Gekko.

590
00:30:37,725 --> 00:30:39,668
Let's go, Buddy,
push yourself.

591
00:30:39,668 --> 00:30:41,433
Finish the game.

592
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:44,202
Very nice club,
Mr. Gekko.

593
00:30:44,202 --> 00:30:45,641
Yeah.

594
00:30:45,641 --> 00:30:48,645
Not bad for
a City College boy.

595
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:50,647
I bought my way in.

596
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:53,207
Now all these
Ivy League schmucks

597
00:30:53,207 --> 00:30:55,651
are sucking
my kneecaps.

598
00:30:55,651 --> 00:30:59,656
I just got on the board
of the Bronx Zoo.

599
00:30:59,656 --> 00:31:01,623
It cost me a mill.

600
00:31:01,623 --> 00:31:03,194
That's the thing

601
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,231
you've got to remember
about WASPs...

602
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,595
they love animals,

603
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:11,192
they can't
stand people.

604
00:31:11,192 --> 00:31:14,205
Uh... Mr. Gekko,

605
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,605
we took
a little loss today.

606
00:31:16,605 --> 00:31:19,644
We got stopped out
on Tarafly,

607
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,645
about 100 grand.

608
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,652
I guess your dad's not a union
representative

609
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,550
<i>of that company, huh?</i>

610
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,715
How do you know
about my father?

611
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:36,226
The most valuable
commodity I know of

612
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:38,627
is information.

613
00:31:38,627 --> 00:31:41,222
Wouldn't you agree?

614
00:31:41,222 --> 00:31:42,767
Yeah.

615
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,240
The public's out there

616
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,903
throwing darts
at a board.

617
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:57,248
I don't throw darts
at a board.

618
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,251
I bet on sure things.

619
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,219
<i>Read Sun Tzu,
The Art of War...</i>

620
00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:05,187
"Every battle is won

621
00:32:05,187 --> 00:32:07,623
before it's ever fought."

622
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:09,217
Think about it.

623
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:12,923
You're not as smart
as I thought, Buddy boy.

624
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,189
You wonder why fund managers

625
00:32:15,189 --> 00:32:17,633
can't beat the S & P 500?

626
00:32:17,633 --> 00:32:20,728
Because they're sheep,
and sheep get slaughtered.

627
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:25,538
I've been in this business
since '69.

628
00:32:25,538 --> 00:32:29,205
These Harvard types
don't add up to dogshit.

629
00:32:29,205 --> 00:32:32,648
Give me guys that are
poor, smart, and hungry,

630
00:32:32,648 --> 00:32:34,218
and no feelings.

631
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:37,221
You lose a few,
but you keep fighting,

632
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:40,690
and if you need a friend,
get a dog.

633
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,227
It's trench warfare
out there, pal.

634
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,660
Hey, Georgie.

635
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,230
Hey, Gordon.

636
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,232
How's Larchmont
treating you?

637
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:50,666
Fine. How's the Praxer
deal going?

638
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:52,259
You should know, pal.

639
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:53,269
Asshole.

640
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:56,830
And inside here, too.

641
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:00,002
I've got 20 other brokers
analyzing charts, pal.

642
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,577
I don't need another one.

643
00:33:02,577 --> 00:33:04,911
See you around, Buddy.

644
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:08,009
I am not just
another broker, Mr. Gekko.

645
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:10,619
If you give me
another chance,

646
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:12,623
I'll prove that to you.

647
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,625
I'll go the extra mile.

648
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,661
You want another chance?

649
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,219
Fucking A!

650
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:20,025
You stop sending me
information,

651
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:22,665
and you start
getting me some.

652
00:33:22,665 --> 00:33:24,032
Get dressed.

653
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,134
<i>I'll show you
my charts.</i>

654
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,706
You know the name?

655
00:33:30,706 --> 00:33:32,743
Of course.
Larry Wildman,

656
00:33:32,743 --> 00:33:34,642
one of the first raiders.

657
00:33:34,642 --> 00:33:39,309
Like all Brits, thinks he was born
with a better piss pot.

658
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,717
Bribed an old secretary
of mine,

659
00:33:41,717 --> 00:33:44,755
stole RDL Pharmaceuticals
right from under me.

660
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:46,757
Wildman, the white knight.

661
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:49,350
I remember that.
You were involved?

662
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,362
Payback time, sport.

663
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,489
You see that building?

664
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,329
I bought that building
10 years ago,

665
00:33:56,329 --> 00:33:58,062
my first real estate deal.

666
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:00,294
Sold it two years later,

667
00:34:00,294 --> 00:34:02,704
made an $800,000 profit.

668
00:34:02,704 --> 00:34:04,709
It was better than sex.

669
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,267
At that time,

670
00:34:06,267 --> 00:34:10,280
I thought that was
all the money in the world.

671
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,282
Now it's a day's pay.

672
00:34:12,282 --> 00:34:15,285
Anyway, I had a mole
in Wildman's operation.

673
00:34:15,285 --> 00:34:18,720
He gave me half the picture,
then got fired.

674
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,314
I don't follow.

675
00:34:20,314 --> 00:34:21,723
Wildman's in town.

676
00:34:21,723 --> 00:34:23,728
He became
an American citizen.

677
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,730
Something big is going down.

678
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,734
I want to know where he goes,
what he sees.

679
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,770
I want you
to fill out the picture.

680
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,772
Ah, Mr. Gekko,
it's not what I do.

681
00:34:35,772 --> 00:34:37,808
I could lose my license.

682
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:39,775
If the SEC found out,

683
00:34:39,775 --> 00:34:41,778
I could go to jail.

684
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:43,575
That's inside information.

685
00:34:43,575 --> 00:34:46,810
You mean like
when a father tells a son

686
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,786
about a court ruling
on an airline,

687
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:52,789
or someone overhears
that I'm buying Teldar Paper

688
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:54,791
and buys some
for himself,

689
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:57,794
or the chairman
of the board of XYZ

690
00:34:57,794 --> 00:35:00,763
decides it's time
to blow out XYZ?

691
00:35:00,763 --> 00:35:02,766
Is that what you mean?

692
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:04,335
I'm afraid, pal,

693
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:07,769
unless your father's on the board
of another company,

694
00:35:07,769 --> 00:35:11,776
you and I are going to have
a tough time

695
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,367
doing business together.

696
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:15,379
What about hard work?

697
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:16,778
What about it?

698
00:35:16,778 --> 00:35:18,783
You stayed up all night

699
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,785
analyzing that dogshit stock
you gave me.

700
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:24,378
My father worked
like an elephant

701
00:35:24,378 --> 00:35:26,424
until he died at 49.

702
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,356
Wake up, will you, pal?

703
00:35:28,356 --> 00:35:31,361
If you're not inside,
you are outside, O.K.?

704
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:34,796
And I'm not talking about
some $400,000-a-year

705
00:35:34,796 --> 00:35:37,836
working Wall Street stiff
flying first class

706
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,370
and being comfortable,

707
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,371
I'm talking about liquid.

708
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:44,374
Rich enough to have your own jet,

709
00:35:44,374 --> 00:35:46,808
Rich enough
not to waste time.

710
00:35:46,808 --> 00:35:49,814
50, 100 million
dollars, Buddy.

711
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,440
A player...

712
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,383
or nothing.

713
00:35:54,383 --> 00:35:58,820
Now, you had what it took
to get in my office.

714
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:03,884
The real question is whether you got
what it takes to stay.

715
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:07,195
Look at that.

716
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,832
Are you going to tell me

717
00:36:09,832 --> 00:36:13,837
the difference between
this guy and that guy is luck?

718
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:17,137
Mohammed, pull over, will you?

719
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:20,143
I'll drop you off here.
I'm late.

720
00:36:20,143 --> 00:36:23,909
Buddy, it's been
nice meeting you, O.K.?

721
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:49,806
All right, Mr. Gekko,

722
00:36:49,806 --> 00:36:51,500
you got me.

723
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:54,828
Excuse me, please.

724
00:37:54,828 --> 00:37:56,271
Excuse us.

725
00:37:56,271 --> 00:37:57,933
Excuse me.

726
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:11,789
How wonderful to see you.

727
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,824
Do you have a reservation?

728
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:15,223
Table for one.

729
00:38:15,223 --> 00:38:16,794
Reservations only.

730
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,830
We're booked for a week.

731
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,922
All right.
Don't touch.

732
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:49,952
Everything ready, sir.

733
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,207
Excuse me!

734
00:39:06,207 --> 00:39:08,769
Mr. Wildman on board that plane?

735
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:09,778
Yeah.

736
00:39:09,778 --> 00:39:12,782
Shit! My boss is going to kill me.

737
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:15,785
I was supposed to
give him this.

738
00:39:15,785 --> 00:39:17,218
Where's he going?

739
00:39:17,218 --> 00:39:18,813
Erie, Pennsylvania.

740
00:39:18,813 --> 00:39:20,653
Thank you.

741
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,393
After spending the morning
at Kahn, Seidelman,

742
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:26,995
the junk bond department
where Shane Mora works,

743
00:39:26,995 --> 00:39:29,397
<i>he had lunch at Les Circus</i>

744
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:31,795
with a group
of bean counters.

745
00:39:31,795 --> 00:39:33,393
He stopped off at Morgan.

746
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:36,607
I'd say from all the sweet smiling

747
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:39,233
that Larry got himself
some nice fat financing.

748
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:41,403
Bright, but not bright enough.

749
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,410
Let's roll the dice
and play some monopoly.

750
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:47,743
Where will Larry land in Erie,
Pennsylvania?

751
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:50,611
Jesus Christ!

752
00:39:50,611 --> 00:39:52,883
He's buying Anacott Steel.

753
00:39:52,883 --> 00:39:55,425
When the market opens tomorrow,

754
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:59,061
I want you to buy
1,500 july 50 calls.

755
00:39:59,061 --> 00:40:00,631
You hear me?

756
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,029
1,500, yes, sir.

757
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:05,069
Start buying
1,000-share blocks.

758
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,128
Take it up to $50.

759
00:40:07,128 --> 00:40:09,070
When it reaches 50,

760
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,405
give a taste
to your friends,

761
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,701
<i>Then call
The Wall Street Chronicle,</i>

762
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:17,270
extension 1605.

763
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,043
Tell the man,

764
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:21,051
"Blue Horseshoe
loves Anacott Steel."

765
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:22,643
You got that?

766
00:40:22,643 --> 00:40:24,881
<i>The Wall Street Chronicle.</i>

767
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:27,083
Congratulations,
Buddy, you scored.

768
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,649
Talk at you.

769
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:29,852
All right.

770
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,063
Start buying Anacott Steel
across the board.

771
00:40:35,063 --> 00:40:38,659
Use the offshore accounts...

772
00:40:38,659 --> 00:40:41,330
and keep it quiet.

773
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:47,475
15,000 General Foods...

774
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,441
Frank, 10,000 ANC at 46.

775
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:53,081
Let me know how the options
open, O.K.?

776
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:54,743
Thank you.

777
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,754
Jack, sign them!

778
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,460
How... How is
Anacott Steel?

779
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,462
53/46th,
2,000 up.

780
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:07,054
6 for 10,000.

781
00:41:07,054 --> 00:41:09,497
I'll sell you 2,000.
2,000 Anacott.

782
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:13,169
That's not what I said.
I said 20,000 shares.

783
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:23,143
Anacott priced at six.

784
00:41:23,143 --> 00:41:24,739
What do you...

785
00:41:24,739 --> 00:41:26,715
And a quarter, 8,0001/4.

786
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:28,149
I'll take it.

787
00:41:28,149 --> 00:41:30,188
What do you want?

788
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:32,722
Yeah, I know how it is.

789
00:41:32,722 --> 00:41:34,724
This is what I'm saying,

790
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:37,761
we have important financial news,
Mr. Earlich,

791
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,161
that happens to concern
your future.

792
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:41,722
You could benefit...

793
00:41:41,722 --> 00:41:43,733
What the hell's going on?

794
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:47,965
Anacott Steel,
put your best customers in it.

795
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:52,173
Lou, I got a sure thing...

796
00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:53,938
Anacott Steel.

797
00:41:53,938 --> 00:41:55,774
No such thing,

798
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:57,781
except death and taxes.

799
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,783
Not a good company anymore,

800
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,147
no fundamentals.

801
00:42:01,147 --> 00:42:03,244
What's going on, Bud.

802
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:07,123
You know something?

803
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:10,126
Remember,
there are no short cuts, son.

804
00:42:10,126 --> 00:42:12,560
Quick-buck artists come and go

805
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:14,560
with every bull market.

806
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:18,132
The steady players make it through
the bear markets.

807
00:42:18,132 --> 00:42:20,534
You're a part
of something here.

808
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:23,137
The money
you make for people

809
00:42:23,137 --> 00:42:25,175
creates science
and research jobs.

810
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,574
You're right, Lou,

811
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:29,541
but you've got to
reach the big time,

812
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:32,146
then you can
do good things.

813
00:42:32,146 --> 00:42:34,582
You can't get
a little pregnant.

814
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:37,287
It's a winner. Buy it.

815
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:39,550
Then we'll kamikaze
over to Nell's

816
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:41,587
and chase some
cotton underwear.

817
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,192
I know this bimbette
that's gorgeous.

818
00:42:44,192 --> 00:42:45,593
Hold on.

819
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,593
Play some tennis saturday?

820
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:49,595
I'm going fishing in Canada,

821
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:51,165
really big client.

822
00:42:51,165 --> 00:42:52,566
Take Anacott.

823
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:54,600
Light snack, but good.

824
00:42:54,873 --> 00:42:57,068
Sharking your way up.

825
00:42:57,068 --> 00:43:00,134
My dear,
you've got to diversify.

826
00:43:00,134 --> 00:43:02,145
I've got
a sure thing...

827
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:03,544
Anacott Steel.

828
00:43:03,544 --> 00:43:06,242
I just heard the most
lovely two words.

829
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:09,586
Blue Horseshoe
loves Anacott Steel.

830
00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:11,087
Anacott Steel?

831
00:43:11,087 --> 00:43:12,180
Right.

832
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,571
Looks like Anacott Steel's
the play.

833
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:30,265
Check the arbs.

834
00:43:31,343 --> 00:43:34,176
Looks like it's
being accumulated.

835
00:43:34,176 --> 00:43:35,177
We've got to
position it.

836
00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:38,147
Yeah, Lou,
Anacott, high buy.

837
00:43:38,147 --> 00:43:41,082
Yeah. Take it and bid it.

838
00:43:41,082 --> 00:43:43,950
If I'm right,
eighths and quarters won't matter.

839
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:46,615
This is really special... Anacott.
Make the tape.

840
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:47,653
Bet the ranch.

841
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:49,154
Buy 100,000 shares.

842
00:43:49,154 --> 00:43:50,125
Wildman's...

843
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:51,991
It's on zoom.

844
00:43:51,991 --> 00:43:55,191
If it hits 75,
we could clean 24 mill.

845
00:43:55,191 --> 00:43:58,201
First lesson...
Don't get emotional about stock,

846
00:43:58,201 --> 00:43:59,600
clouds the judgment.

847
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,502
<i>... which closed
at 511/8,</i>

848
00:44:01,502 --> 00:44:04,939
<i>up 51/8 from yesterday's close
on heavy trading.</i>

849
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,124
Can I help you?

850
00:44:21,124 --> 00:44:22,557
I'm Bud Fox.

851
00:44:22,557 --> 00:44:25,255
I have some papers
for Mr. Gekko.

852
00:44:25,255 --> 00:44:27,126
Come in.

853
00:44:27,126 --> 00:44:28,529
Thank you.

854
00:44:28,529 --> 00:44:31,101
I'm sorry about this,
Mr. Gekko.

855
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:33,568
It's all right.
It's O.K.

856
00:44:33,568 --> 00:44:35,105
All right.

857
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:37,106
You want to wait here?

858
00:44:37,106 --> 00:44:38,106
Problems?

859
00:44:38,106 --> 00:44:39,540
There's no problem.

860
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,545
Bud Fox, my wife Kate.

861
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:43,136
A pleasure.

862
00:44:43,136 --> 00:44:45,113
You came from the city?

863
00:44:45,113 --> 00:44:46,547
Yes, ma'am.

864
00:44:46,547 --> 00:44:49,142
Long drive.
You want a drink?

865
00:44:49,142 --> 00:44:51,119
Yeah, you want a drink?

866
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,553
If you'd rather not...

867
00:44:52,553 --> 00:44:54,557
Have a drink,
meet everyone.

868
00:44:54,557 --> 00:44:56,524
It's a good idea.

869
00:44:56,524 --> 00:44:59,563
That's Sam Ruspoli, Carmen Winters,
Stone Livingston.

870
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:01,928
This is Bud Fox.

871
00:45:01,928 --> 00:45:04,501
His illustrious
wife Muffie,

872
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,661
Candice Rogers,
Dick Brady,

873
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:09,103
Darien Taylor,
all old friends.

874
00:45:09,103 --> 00:45:09,853
Hi.

875
00:45:12,644 --> 00:45:13,633
Hello.

876
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,579
Great idea, Gordon.

877
00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:18,410
Good help
is hard to find,

878
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:21,508
But can he create
a dry vodka martini?

879
00:45:21,508 --> 00:45:24,110
Doesn't talk back,
doesn't steal silverware,

880
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,316
and Dick's getting me
an exemption.

881
00:45:26,316 --> 00:45:28,119
Dick.

882
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:29,716
I'm in St. Kitt's

883
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:32,485
with this new Kamali
leopard-skin bikini,

884
00:45:32,485 --> 00:45:36,533
which is going to turn back the clock
on my marriage,

885
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,534
you know what I mean?

886
00:45:38,534 --> 00:45:41,605
Call for you, sir.
Sir Lawrence Wildman.

887
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:43,674
He says it's important.

888
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:46,677
Thank you, Nyun.
Fix Mr. Livingston another martini.

889
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,713
This could be fun.

890
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:50,644
...all because
this Ukrainian bitch

891
00:45:50,644 --> 00:45:53,206
botched the job
on my wax.

892
00:45:53,206 --> 00:45:55,684
Oh, how ghastly!
You should sue.

893
00:45:55,684 --> 00:45:57,687
Larry, what a surprise.

894
00:45:57,687 --> 00:45:59,656
I want to see you.

895
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:02,625
Can it wait?
I've got some people over.

896
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:04,194
This can't wait.

897
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:07,322
If you feel that way,
come on over.

898
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:12,194
Listen, can I steal him
for a minute?

899
00:46:12,194 --> 00:46:13,634
Of course.

900
00:46:13,634 --> 00:46:15,729
I want your opinion.

901
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,215
So, what do you see in this?

902
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:32,622
Purity, innocence...

903
00:46:32,622 --> 00:46:35,591
A few thousand dollars
down the tubes

904
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:37,558
if you ask me.

905
00:46:37,558 --> 00:46:38,560
Really?

906
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,564
Well, I guess
you can kiss your career

907
00:46:41,564 --> 00:46:44,157
as an art appraiser
goodbye.

908
00:46:44,157 --> 00:46:46,567
We paid over 400,000
for it.

909
00:46:46,567 --> 00:46:49,333
You could have had a whole
beach house.

910
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:53,571
Sure you could,
in Wildwood, New Jersey.

911
00:46:53,571 --> 00:46:55,578
If you sold this one,

912
00:46:55,578 --> 00:46:59,116
you could have a pretty nice
penthouse on 5th,

913
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:02,118
but you wouldn't have much left
for decoration.

914
00:47:02,118 --> 00:47:04,552
It's nice
if you're on mushrooms.

915
00:47:04,552 --> 00:47:08,388
Boy, I thought Gordon
was a real tough businessman.

916
00:47:08,388 --> 00:47:11,656
He's really
taken a bath on that.

917
00:47:11,656 --> 00:47:14,129
I'd say Gordon is one of

918
00:47:14,129 --> 00:47:16,393
<i>the most astute
collectors around.</i>

919
00:47:16,393 --> 00:47:20,164
He has a great eye
and only buys the best.

920
00:47:20,164 --> 00:47:21,670
Like this rug,

921
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:24,571
a Boccaro,
the finest of its kind.

922
00:47:24,571 --> 00:47:27,133
The day after
he bought it,

923
00:47:27,133 --> 00:47:29,145
the Saudi royal family

924
00:47:29,145 --> 00:47:31,340
offered twice
what he paid.

925
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,316
It absolutely
makes the room.

926
00:47:34,316 --> 00:47:37,684
This celadon is picked up
by these cushions

927
00:47:37,684 --> 00:47:39,188
on the sofa.

928
00:47:39,188 --> 00:47:40,723
That Etruscan vase

929
00:47:40,723 --> 00:47:43,293
on the coffee table
is sacrilegious.

930
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:45,760
Someone might use it
as an ashtray.

931
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,230
I guess you're a decorator?

932
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:49,595
You got it.

933
00:47:49,595 --> 00:47:51,897
Great spender of other
people's money.

934
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,161
Well, if you're that good,

935
00:47:54,161 --> 00:47:57,207
you could do wonders
with my place.

936
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,639
Where is that?

937
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:00,109
Upper West Side.

938
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:02,577
Home of the exposed
brick wall

939
00:48:02,577 --> 00:48:04,580
and the house plant?

940
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,149
It's a rental.

941
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:09,152
I'm moving to
the East Side soon.

942
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:11,552
Couple of deals
brewing with Gordon.

943
00:48:11,552 --> 00:48:13,385
What about real things,

944
00:48:13,385 --> 00:48:17,120
like dinner, the two of us,
next Friday,

945
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,855
Cafe Santa Domingo?

946
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:22,228
What if I have a previous
engagement?

947
00:48:22,228 --> 00:48:23,561
You break it.

948
00:48:23,561 --> 00:48:25,932
There you go again,
Darien,

949
00:48:26,204 --> 00:48:28,729
talking with strange men.

950
00:48:28,729 --> 00:48:31,138
Sam, do you know Bud Fox?

951
00:48:31,138 --> 00:48:32,573
Sam's in banking.

952
00:48:32,573 --> 00:48:34,167
Works for Gordon.

953
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:35,576
Nice meeting you.

954
00:48:35,576 --> 00:48:37,580
Are you staying for dinner?

955
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,616
No. I've got to work.

956
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:42,719
Ah, the bell.

957
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,190
Excuse me.

958
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,284
Call me next week
for an estimate.

959
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:56,592
Larry, how have you been?

960
00:48:56,592 --> 00:48:58,635
Just fine.
Traveling actually.

961
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:01,569
Yes? Can I get you a drink?

962
00:49:01,569 --> 00:49:02,970
Larry!

963
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:05,573
<i>Excuse me.
Sir Larry.</i>

964
00:49:05,573 --> 00:49:06,974
How are you?

965
00:49:07,245 --> 00:49:08,974
God damn,
you look great.

966
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:09,975
Gordon.

967
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:11,977
So you want to talk?

968
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,548
I'll be heading back,
Mr. Gekko.

969
00:49:14,548 --> 00:49:16,176
Stick around.

970
00:49:16,176 --> 00:49:18,449
This is Bud Fox.

971
00:49:21,893 --> 00:49:23,986
Should we go upstairs?

972
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:25,388
Yeah.

973
00:49:34,672 --> 00:49:37,664
The rarest pistol
in the world, Larry,

974
00:49:37,664 --> 00:49:40,573
A.45 Luger.

975
00:49:40,573 --> 00:49:45,012
Only six of them were ever
manufactured.

976
00:49:45,283 --> 00:49:46,580
Congratulations.

977
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:49,551
Rarer still is your interest
in Anacott Steel.

978
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:52,623
My interest is the same as yours,
Larry...

979
00:49:52,623 --> 00:49:53,622
money.

980
00:49:53,622 --> 00:49:56,626
It's a good investment
for my kid.

981
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,923
I'm in for the long term.

982
00:49:58,923 --> 00:50:00,589
It's not a liquidation.

983
00:50:00,589 --> 00:50:03,223
I'm going to
turn it around.

984
00:50:03,223 --> 00:50:05,030
You're getting
a free ride.

985
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:08,636
With the dollars you're costing me
to buy the stock,

986
00:50:08,636 --> 00:50:10,640
I could modernize
the plant.

987
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,609
I'm not the only one
who pays here.

988
00:50:13,609 --> 00:50:16,043
We're talking about
lives and jobs,

989
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:17,781
generations
of steelworkers.

990
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:19,611
Correct me if I'm wrong.

991
00:50:19,611 --> 00:50:22,242
When you acquired
CNX Electronics,

992
00:50:22,242 --> 00:50:24,254
you laid off
6,000 workers.

993
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:25,721
Jemson Fruit, 4,000.

994
00:50:25,721 --> 00:50:27,654
That airline you bought, um...

995
00:50:27,654 --> 00:50:31,661
I could break you, mate,
in two pieces over my knees.

996
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,628
We both know it.

997
00:50:33,628 --> 00:50:36,666
I could buy you
six times over.

998
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:40,033
I could dump the stock
just to burn your ass,

999
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:42,465
but I want the company,

1000
00:50:42,465 --> 00:50:45,667
and I want your block of shares.

1001
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:48,007
I'm announcing
a tender offer

1002
00:50:48,007 --> 00:50:49,602
at 65 tomorrow.

1003
00:50:49,602 --> 00:50:51,614
I'm expecting
your commitment.

1004
00:50:51,614 --> 00:50:53,673
Showdowns bore me, Larry.

1005
00:50:53,673 --> 00:50:55,275
Nobody wins.

1006
00:50:55,275 --> 00:50:57,082
You can have the company.

1007
00:50:57,355 --> 00:51:00,051
In fact, it's going to be fun

1008
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:02,622
watching you
and your giant ego

1009
00:51:02,622 --> 00:51:06,288
try to make
a horse race of it.

1010
00:51:06,288 --> 00:51:08,024
Buddy, what's a fair price?

1011
00:51:08,024 --> 00:51:10,066
The breakup
value is higher.

1012
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:11,631
It's worth 80.

1013
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:14,330
We don't want to be greedy.

1014
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:16,873
What do you say to 72?

1015
00:51:18,142 --> 00:51:21,043
You're a two-bit pirate
and greenmailer,

1016
00:51:21,043 --> 00:51:24,637
nothing more... Gekko.

1017
00:51:24,637 --> 00:51:29,049
Not only would you sell your mother
to make a deal,

1018
00:51:29,049 --> 00:51:31,053
you'd send her C.O.D.

1019
00:51:31,053 --> 00:51:35,091
My mail is the same color
as yours is, pal,

1020
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,054
or at least it was

1021
00:51:37,054 --> 00:51:40,062
until the queen started to
call you "Sir."

1022
00:51:40,062 --> 00:51:42,064
Now, you'll excuse me

1023
00:51:42,064 --> 00:51:44,066
before I lose my temper.

1024
00:51:44,066 --> 00:51:44,816
71.

1025
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:55,109
Well, now, considering
you brought my mother into it,

1026
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:56,971
71.50.

1027
00:52:00,985 --> 00:52:02,043
Done.

1028
00:52:02,043 --> 00:52:05,611
You'll hear from my lawyers
tomorrow, 8 A.M.

1029
00:52:05,611 --> 00:52:07,350
Good night.

1030
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:15,064
I had to sell.

1031
00:52:15,064 --> 00:52:17,067
The key is
capital reserves.

1032
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,069
You don't have enough,

1033
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:22,071
you can't piss
with the big dogs.

1034
00:52:22,071 --> 00:52:24,004
"All warfare's
based on deception."

1035
00:52:24,004 --> 00:52:25,666
Sun Tzu.

1036
00:52:25,666 --> 00:52:27,641
"If your enemy is superior,

1037
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:29,076
evade him,

1038
00:52:29,076 --> 00:52:31,638
if angry, irritate him,

1039
00:52:31,638 --> 00:52:34,081
if equally matched, fight,

1040
00:52:34,081 --> 00:52:37,485
and if not,
split and reevaluate."

1041
00:52:37,485 --> 00:52:40,921
Yeah, hey, hey, he's learning, huh?
Buddy's learning.

1042
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:52,667
Yeah.

1043
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:54,670
Money never sleeps, pal.

1044
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:57,104
Just made 800,000
Hong Kong gold.

1045
00:52:57,104 --> 00:52:59,200
It's been wired to you.

1046
00:52:59,443 --> 00:53:00,637
Play with it.

1047
00:53:00,637 --> 00:53:02,042
You done good,

1048
00:53:02,042 --> 00:53:05,047
but you've got to
keep doing good.

1049
00:53:05,047 --> 00:53:08,016
I showed you the game,
now school's out.

1050
00:53:08,016 --> 00:53:11,145
Mr. Gekko,
I'm there for you 110%.

1051
00:53:11,145 --> 00:53:13,780
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

1052
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,951
I want to be surprised.

1053
00:53:15,951 --> 00:53:18,460
Astonish me, pal.
New info.

1054
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:22,465
I don't care where
or how you get it,

1055
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:24,592
just get it.

1056
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:27,870
My, uh, wife tells me

1057
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:29,872
you made a move
on Darien.

1058
00:53:29,872 --> 00:53:32,909
Well, here's some
inside info for you.

1059
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:35,911
<i>That euroflash GQ type
she's going out with</i>

1060
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:37,913
has got big bucks,

1061
00:53:37,913 --> 00:53:40,882
but he's putting
her feet to sleep.

1062
00:53:40,882 --> 00:53:42,885
Exit visas are imminent,

1063
00:53:42,885 --> 00:53:46,923
so I don't want you
losing your place in line.

1064
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:49,458
Ah, Jesus...

1065
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:52,495
I wish
you could see this.

1066
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,622
Light's coming up.

1067
00:53:58,002 --> 00:53:59,902
I've never
seen a painting

1068
00:53:59,902 --> 00:54:02,837
that captures the beauty
of the ocean

1069
00:54:02,837 --> 00:54:05,966
at a moment
like this.

1070
00:54:05,966 --> 00:54:09,274
I'm going to make you rich,
Bud Fox.

1071
00:54:09,513 --> 00:54:11,845
Yeah, rich enough

1072
00:54:11,845 --> 00:54:14,850
you can afford
a girl like Darien.

1073
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:18,285
This is your wake-up call,
pal.

1074
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:19,989
Go to work.

1075
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:36,871
Fox.

1076
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:38,771
Mr. Barnes.

1077
00:54:38,771 --> 00:54:41,037
Buddy, is this deja vu?

1078
00:54:41,037 --> 00:54:44,046
What's it been,
a year and a half?

1079
00:54:44,046 --> 00:54:47,640
So, I hear you're moving up
in the world.

1080
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,652
Senior associate.
Not bad.

1081
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:51,210
How's Margie?

1082
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:55,053
We got a house
in Oyster Bay, you know.

1083
00:54:55,053 --> 00:54:57,059
Market treating you good?

1084
00:54:57,059 --> 00:54:59,629
Still seeing
that sexy French chick?

1085
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,597
No, no.
She asked the wrong question...

1086
00:55:02,597 --> 00:55:04,600
"What are you thinking?"

1087
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:12,041
The hours are hell,
but the cash is tumbling in.

1088
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:13,610
I know someone

1089
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:16,612
who knows an ironclad way
of making money.

1090
00:55:16,612 --> 00:55:18,306
I can't get hurt.

1091
00:55:18,582 --> 00:55:20,015
Can't get hurt?

1092
00:55:20,015 --> 00:55:23,177
Does he have a tip
for honest lawyers?

1093
00:55:23,177 --> 00:55:25,050
Maybe...

1094
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:27,056
check out Teldar Paper,

1095
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:29,558
but don't quote me.

1096
00:55:29,558 --> 00:55:31,025
What about you?

1097
00:55:31,025 --> 00:55:33,062
I hear you're handling

1098
00:55:33,062 --> 00:55:35,064
the Fairchild Foods merger.

1099
00:55:35,064 --> 00:55:37,623
Any surprises
I haven't read about

1100
00:55:37,623 --> 00:55:39,669
<i>in The Wall StreetJournal?</i>

1101
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,067
Buddy, that's illegal.

1102
00:55:41,067 --> 00:55:43,072
I could get disbarred.

1103
00:55:43,072 --> 00:55:45,608
Well, who's listening?

1104
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:49,077
Just one college buddy
talking to another.

1105
00:55:49,077 --> 00:55:50,613
Yeah, right.

1106
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:52,649
Oh, relax, Roger.

1107
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:55,082
Everybody's doing it,

1108
00:55:55,082 --> 00:55:57,086
but if you don't know,

1109
00:55:57,086 --> 00:55:59,714
then...
you don't know.

1110
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:07,063
And if I did,

1111
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:10,031
<i>what's in it for moi?</i>

1112
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:14,627
More money than
you ever dreamed of.

1113
00:56:14,627 --> 00:56:18,641
Nobody gets hurt.

1114
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:21,075
You think about it.

1115
00:56:21,075 --> 00:56:24,045
Let's grab a beer.
What do you say?

1116
00:56:24,045 --> 00:56:27,743
No. Too much to do,
but I'll walk you out.

1117
00:56:27,743 --> 00:56:30,047
File's on the desk, Marie.

1118
00:56:30,047 --> 00:56:32,622
Get inside
my uncle's door, Bud,

1119
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:35,658
all the secrets
of the world are yours.

1120
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:37,660
The lifeblood of companies.

1121
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:42,188
Of course, you've got to go
to law school first.

1122
00:56:58,249 --> 00:57:00,945
I've been charting the growth
of office space.

1123
00:57:00,945 --> 00:57:04,418
You're in the right business
at the right time.

1124
00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:06,417
I already know that.

1125
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,988
I'm very impressed
with your work

1126
00:57:08,988 --> 00:57:10,993
in this
growing business.

1127
00:57:10,993 --> 00:57:14,053
Does working capital
and a partner interest you?

1128
00:57:14,053 --> 00:57:16,429
Why do I need a partner?

1129
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,997
You need vans,

1130
00:57:17,997 --> 00:57:21,003
your employees can't cover
all your buildings,

1131
00:57:21,003 --> 00:57:23,005
not to mention
the clients

1132
00:57:23,005 --> 00:57:25,007
we could have together.

1133
00:57:25,007 --> 00:57:28,010
I'm an expert
at identifying undervalued assets

1134
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:30,137
such as this business.

1135
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:18,485
Well, the good news, Gordon,

1136
00:58:18,762 --> 00:58:19,990
is Roarker Electronics.

1137
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:23,533
I see it happening
in the next few months.

1138
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:26,395
You're kidding!
Their quarterlies are for shit.

1139
00:58:26,395 --> 00:58:28,438
I've got something
for you.

1140
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,996
Let me see.

1141
00:58:29,996 --> 00:58:32,007
Gordon will be
very pleased.

1142
00:58:32,007 --> 00:58:34,100
What else have you got?

1143
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,744
Let's get a pizza, man.

1144
00:58:38,744 --> 00:58:41,044
You know Marty Windman?

1145
00:58:41,044 --> 00:58:44,019
He netted 650G
off that merger.

1146
00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:46,021
The guy's an asshole.

1147
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:47,454
He's a Rambo.

1148
00:58:47,454 --> 00:58:49,890
He's got himself
a Porsche Cabriolet.

1149
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:54,021
If I make a bundle of cash
before I'm 30

1150
00:58:54,021 --> 00:58:56,463
and get out of this racket,

1151
00:58:56,463 --> 00:58:59,435
I can ride my motorcycle
across China.

1152
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:01,971
I'd like to do
for furniture

1153
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:04,404
what Laura Ashley
did for fabrics...

1154
00:59:04,404 --> 00:59:07,409
produce high-quality antiques
at a low price.

1155
00:59:07,409 --> 00:59:09,979
Sounds great.
I'll take you public.

1156
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,275
You will?

1157
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:36,902
Can I help you?

1158
00:59:36,902 --> 00:59:38,440
Oh, excuse me.

1159
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,442
Is this Bill Bates' office?

1160
00:59:40,442 --> 00:59:41,478
No.

1161
00:59:41,478 --> 00:59:43,274
I'm sorry.

1162
00:59:54,158 --> 00:59:55,921
Hiya, dad.

1163
00:59:55,921 --> 00:59:57,550
What brings you out here?

1164
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:59,891
A client...
and a private jet.

1165
00:59:59,891 --> 01:00:01,362
Hey, Buddy, how you doing?

1166
01:00:01,362 --> 01:00:02,932
Mr. Wall Street.

1167
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,935
It's the bozos that keep us
in the air.

1168
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,333
Give us a hand.

1169
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:10,373
Change the oil
and park it out back.

1170
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,942
This kid want to buy the plane?

1171
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,377
How come you light up
when you see me?

1172
01:00:16,377 --> 01:00:18,243
Don't start.

1173
01:00:18,243 --> 01:00:20,214
Who peed in your Cheerios?

1174
01:00:20,214 --> 01:00:22,649
The fare wars are killing us.

1175
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:25,650
Management's laying off
five of my men.

1176
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:27,857
There's nothing I can do.

1177
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,655
What's with you?
How much you need?

1178
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:32,657
Nothing.
I'm doing great.

1179
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:34,659
Things are
starting to happen.

1180
01:00:34,898 --> 01:00:37,628
Many guys at the track
talk like that.

1181
01:00:37,901 --> 01:00:41,234
How do you know you'll have dough
next month?

1182
01:00:41,234 --> 01:00:44,671
What is this?
I gave you a few hundred!

1183
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:46,170
It's dividend.

1184
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:49,610
I've borrowed at least five grand
in pocket change.

1185
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:52,477
Put this toward
your school loan.

1186
01:00:52,477 --> 01:00:57,248
Look, things are good,
and it's going to stay that way.

1187
01:00:57,248 --> 01:00:59,652
Buy yourself a new suit.

1188
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:02,289
Why do I need a suit?

1189
01:01:02,289 --> 01:01:05,885
I don't hobnob
with the jet set.

1190
01:01:05,885 --> 01:01:07,896
Get a bowling jacket

1191
01:01:07,896 --> 01:01:11,297
so you don't look like
the Roto-Rooter man.

1192
01:01:11,297 --> 01:01:13,302
What's money for?
Enjoy yourself.

1193
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,702
Money's a pain
in the ass.

1194
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:17,338
How about dinner?

1195
01:01:17,338 --> 01:01:19,306
Sure. Any night this week.

1196
01:01:19,306 --> 01:01:22,311
O. K... No, I'm sorry,
this week's booked.

1197
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:24,313
I'll get back to you.

1198
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:26,713
You know where to find me.

1199
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:30,147
I got to run, Dad.
Stop smoking.

1200
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:35,015
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

1201
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,260
Ohh!

1202
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:39,195
Aah!

1203
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,365
It's in both our interests

1204
01:01:45,365 --> 01:01:49,065
to put a safe distance
between you and us.

1205
01:01:49,065 --> 01:01:51,300
Now, you understand that,
Mr. Fox?

1206
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,340
Sure.

1207
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,344
This gives you
limited power of attorney

1208
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,744
for Mr. Gekko's account.

1209
01:01:57,981 --> 01:02:01,747
Every ticket you buy must be marked
"power of attorney."

1210
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:03,748
You call the shots.

1211
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:05,750
Mr. Gekko has no knowledge

1212
01:02:06,023 --> 01:02:07,957
of what stocks
you're buying.

1213
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:09,083
Sign it.

1214
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:11,753
I never knew
how poor I was

1215
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:14,429
till I started
making some money.

1216
01:02:14,429 --> 01:02:17,364
Your transactions will be monitored
by stockwatch.

1217
01:02:17,364 --> 01:02:20,335
If any trouble arises,
you're on your own.

1218
01:02:20,335 --> 01:02:23,600
The trail does stop with you.
You understand?

1219
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:27,040
Spread the buy orders
over different accounts.

1220
01:02:28,755 --> 01:02:32,987
I have some friends that won't mind
making easy money.

1221
01:02:32,987 --> 01:02:35,027
Rudy kazootee!

1222
01:02:35,027 --> 01:02:36,390
How's my cutie?

1223
01:02:36,663 --> 01:02:37,960
<i>Viens ici.</i>

1224
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,691
Oh, yeah!
