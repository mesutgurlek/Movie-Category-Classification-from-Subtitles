1
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:59,578
It's 73 degrees on this beautiful morning,
it's 6:59 in the A.M.

2
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:05,246
Well enjoy Mr.Sunshine while you can friends
because news is predicting storms tomorrow.

3
00:01:05,337 --> 00:01:08,421
So it's time to wake up and enjoy the day.

4
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:11,507
Wake up... Wake up now, Julian!

5
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:15,044
Julian...
Julian!

6
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:16,673
JULIAN!

7
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:30,581
Mister... is that your car?

8
00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:32,882
What?

9
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:35,716
The cool Porsche.
You keep staring at it.

10
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:39,350
- Why don't you shoo?
- I don't wanna shoo.

11
00:04:39,393 --> 00:04:41,930
Didn't your mother tell you never
to talk to strangers?

12
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:44,550
She's over there, and she said
that I should talk to you.

13
00:04:44,604 --> 00:04:46,479
- She did?
- Yes.

14
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:48,975
She wants to know what you do here.

15
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:51,149
I think she thinks you're cute.

16
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:55,983
I don't know anything about that car.

17
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:59,026
And I'm only interested in your mother
if she lost 20 pounds and 30 years-

18
00:04:59,283 --> 00:05:01,822
- so I'd really like it if you get the
fuck off here, thank you very much.

19
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:04,824
- Whatever.
- Yeah, whatever, goodbye, scoodoodle!

20
00:05:04,914 --> 00:05:08,530
- See you, would'nt wanna be you.
- Smell you, should'nt have to tell you.

21
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:30,474
Hi.

22
00:06:32,818 --> 00:06:35,937
- You're up eary.
- The thunder woke me up.

23
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:39,478
And I wanted to see you before you left.

24
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:45,661
- I'm gonna miss that.
- Me too, I'll gonna miss everyting.

25
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:47,653
- It's only two nights.

26
00:06:47,663 --> 00:06:50,749
- With this weather and
our luck, it scares me.

27
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,702
Honey... you know I got to go.

28
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,993
But I'm coming home in two days.

29
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,453
With really good news...
I promise.

30
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,057
Are you sure you have time?

31
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,388
Maybe not for dinner and movie, but...

32
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:52,047
Still horny?

33
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:14,432
Danny! Danny!

34
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:20,936
- I'm so sorry, Phil.
- It's fine, is Bean alright?

35
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:26,741
Yeah, the fire-department is over there.

36
00:08:26,952 --> 00:08:28,446
She's fine, really...

37
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:30,528
She practically forced me to get over here.

38
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:32,449
She knows what this job means, right?

39
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:34,954
Well, she knows somebody has to pay
for a new kitchen.

40
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,080
- Then we better make this flight, right?
- Yeah, we will.

41
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:42,748
- We'll have to.
- Hope the weather is better in Mexico.

42
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,606
Mr Noble, how are you today?

43
00:09:08,236 --> 00:09:11,484
Couldn't be better...
but more importantly...

44
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:16,325
...how are you, Genevive?

45
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,494
Good day.

46
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,291
A Marguerita, please.

47
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:11,747
I was wondering, I'm looking for a
particulary bloody bullfight.

48
00:11:11,794 --> 00:11:14,997
Any chance one's happening this Sunday?

49
00:11:15,548 --> 00:11:18,797
A matador from Madrid
fights on Sunday.

50
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:38,439
Are you in town for business or pleasure?

51
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:41,147
My business is my pleasure.

52
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:09,375
How you doing?

53
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:12,674
- I'm a nervous wreck.
- Think positive.

54
00:12:12,885 --> 00:12:16,006
I think that I'm sweating through my suit.

55
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:04,087
Hallo, Julian!

56
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:08,715
- Getting some culture?
- Indeed...

57
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:12,509
Isn't she a tad young?
Even for you...

58
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,931
I'd make an exception for her.

59
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:16,811
Did you study the assignment?

60
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:21,973
No, I shredded it, then I humped the bellboy
on the room-service cart.

61
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:24,269
Am I supposed to be chocked?

62
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:31,481
I hate these catholic countries.

63
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,365
All blushy, blushy... no sucky, fucky.

64
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:39,744
Well somehow,
I think you may find your way.

65
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:43,114
Now look, there's been a change of planes.

66
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:46,950
The portfolio have to be delivered sooner
than we discussed.

67
00:13:47,003 --> 00:13:48,378
What are you sayin'?

68
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:51,879
- She's leaving for Europe tomorrow.
- I'm not a fuckin' magician, you know.

69
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:53,750
Just get it done today.

70
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:03,629
I almost forgot..!

71
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:07,224
- Yeah?
- Happy birthday!

72
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:20,476
Happy birthday?
...fuck.

73
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:50,507
We shouldn't even need to think about it.
That's good!

74
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:54,590
- Yes!
- Two Margueritas, please.

75
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:00,137
- I think we did it. - Yeah, I don't know
what you're freaking out about man.

76
00:15:00,188 --> 00:15:01,386
You were remarkable back there.

77
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:03,561
- No, you were.
- No, you, it was you.

78
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:07,191
- It's no way they can't give us this job.
- You think that?

79
00:15:07,277 --> 00:15:08,819
I know...

80
00:16:05,658 --> 00:16:07,401
- Hallo? - Andy?
- Yes?

81
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:12,324
- Andy, you crazy bastard, it's me.
- Who?

82
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:14,455
- Julian!
- Who?

83
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:17,286
Julian Noble, from Portugal,
remember?

84
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:19,457
- Who?
- Julian Noble?

85
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:23,793
I'd just thought I've give you a chat,
see how you're doing.

86
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:25,832
It's my birthday.

87
00:16:27,342 --> 00:16:29,335
Andy? Hallo?

88
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:42,470
Hallo, is Cindy there?

89
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:52,362
Fuck it...!

90
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,749
Now this smells like a party.

91
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,506
- Marguerita, please.
- Yes, sir.

92
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:35,512
Well, you look like you could use one.

93
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:43,646
Who couldn't?

94
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:50,148
4, 5... maybe.

95
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:53,657
Margueritas always
taste better in Mexico.

96
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:57,238
- They certainly do!
- Margueritas and cock.

97
00:18:01,168 --> 00:18:02,449
Thanks...

98
00:18:02,544 --> 00:18:05,960
- Give one for my friend, over there.
- No no, that's...

99
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,466
-Don't worry,
I'm not trying to make a pass at you.

100
00:18:08,477 --> 00:18:09,415
- I'm not worried, but thank you.

101
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:11,334
- If you're that type of guy...
- No, I mean thank you...

102
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:15,631
- I don't mean to be rude, but...
- It's alright, I'm just messing with you.

103
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,478
I'm sorry about the cock-comment.

104
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,647
- It kind of conversation-stopped.
- Kind of.

105
00:18:36,822 --> 00:18:40,025
So... what are you doing in Mexico?

106
00:18:45,788 --> 00:18:47,662
Tell me something...

107
00:18:48,498 --> 00:18:50,490
Danny. Danny Wright.

108
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:52,958
Garrison and Wright.

109
00:18:54,462 --> 00:18:59,288
- Tell me something... Danny Wright.
- Yes, sir!

110
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:04,253
Why the hell do you care why I'm in Mexico?

111
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:07,512
- Why so interested?
- No reason...

112
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,892
just a hotelbar-conversation
I guess.

113
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,051
- You're with the firm?
- What's that?

114
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:15,894
- The agency.
- What?

115
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:18,606
- Did you following me?
- No, no, I...

116
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:21,316
- I've make you.
- I've no idea what you're talking about...

117
00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:23,019
I've fuckin' make you.

118
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:26,936
Okey... I'm gonna excuse myself...

119
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:30,859
No, no... please!

120
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:33,528
- Please...
- I'm very tired...

121
00:19:33,618 --> 00:19:35,161
- I didn't mean a word...
- It's okey...

122
00:19:35,203 --> 00:19:38,369
I just get paranoid sometimes,
I was wrong, please!

123
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:42,868
I'm drunk... and tired.

124
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:44,952
I've been fornicating for the last 2 hours-

125
00:19:45,003 --> 00:19:47,290
- and before that I've been doing shit.

126
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:49,130
Horrible business-shit...

127
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:54,548
I was out of order... lets finish
our drinks, come on.

128
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:57,920
Here you go...
here's your drink.

129
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,262
And you seem like a nice guy...

130
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:04,591
You know, a normal guy.

131
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:07,143
I'm sorry...

132
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:11,062
Really, it's alright.

133
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:16,645
So... you're in town on business?

134
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:19,568
You have that way about you, Danny.

135
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,652
Why so interested?

136
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:35,869
- That was good.
- Yeah?

137
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:41,173
- I'm here on business.
- Is it going well?

138
00:20:41,215 --> 00:20:42,957
Very well, I hope.

139
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,419
My partner and I,
he's upstairs... we just had a...

140
00:20:47,553 --> 00:20:50,423
- ...very good pitch-session.
- No shit!

141
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,014
- Very good!
- That's fantastic.

142
00:20:54,142 --> 00:20:57,225
- That's great, Danny!
- I needed a day like this.

143
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,602
I've had a tough couple of years...

144
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:05,432
I was with this business at Denver,
for nine years...

145
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:10,937
And out of the blue...
they laid me off.

146
00:21:11,948 --> 00:21:14,618
Yeah, just like that, and...

147
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:17,861
...it was about two and a half years ago,
I've been struggling back ever since.

148
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:19,950
And today you go back.

149
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,203
Well... I hope.

150
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:28,159
- Today, you're a man again.
- Yeah.

151
00:21:28,628 --> 00:21:31,712
And to be a man,
after they fuck you...

152
00:21:32,507 --> 00:21:34,879
...and destroyed your self-respect...

153
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:38,384
...well, that is a great thing.

154
00:21:39,804 --> 00:21:41,712
Thank you.

155
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:45,138
Two Margueritas, please.

156
00:21:48,644 --> 00:21:52,428
- Are you married, Danny?
- Yeah, yeah... 14 years.

157
00:21:53,356 --> 00:21:56,310
Let me guess, high-school sweetheart...

158
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:59,520
- It's true.
- Unbelievable.

159
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:02,476
That fuckin' american dream,
eh?

160
00:22:02,615 --> 00:22:06,481
Yeah... what about you?
What do you do for living?

161
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:12,202
Kids...?
You got kids, Danny?

162
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:17,035
- No, I crossed the line.
- No, you did not.

163
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,243
- Yes I did.
- You did not cross the line.

164
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:22,212
It's fine.

165
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:32,471
We lost our son three years ago.

166
00:22:37,142 --> 00:22:39,680
It was a school-bus accident.

167
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,557
14 children lived that day...

168
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:45,764
And one died...

169
00:22:49,444 --> 00:22:51,318
That was Henry.

170
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,779
We had hard for a while...

171
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,614
- Two mexicans walk into a cantina!
- What?

172
00:23:04,122 --> 00:23:06,032
Two mexicans walk into a cantina.

173
00:23:06,082 --> 00:23:09,119
One of them is a midget, the other one
has a dick that's 15 inches long!

174
00:23:09,752 --> 00:23:12,706
- What are you saying?
- I'm just trying to change the subject.

175
00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:14,788
So the midget says to the bartender:

176
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:19,133
They call my friend, the human hard-on,
do you know what they call me?

177
00:23:20,386 --> 00:23:22,793
- This is incredible!
- What?

178
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:26,882
You're very rude.

179
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:30,176
- I'm just trying to change the subject.
- Thank you very much for the drink.

180
00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:33,394
Goodbye... goodnight, thank you.

181
00:23:35,107 --> 00:23:37,182
Don't you wanna hear the punch-line?

182
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:43,817
It's a fuckin' good one...

183
00:23:49,492 --> 00:23:51,201
Thanks.

184
00:24:50,042 --> 00:24:53,244
- Are you sure you don't wanna switch?
- No, no, you go.

185
00:24:53,294 --> 00:24:54,754
- You're the one with the kids.

186
00:24:54,764 --> 00:24:56,412
- And you're the one with a tree
in your kitchen.

187
00:24:56,422 --> 00:24:58,248
You wanna flip another coin?

188
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:00,836
Come on somebody has to stay, I'll call
the minute I hear something.

189
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:02,508
- Call me sooner.
- Yeah.

190
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,800
- Oh, God!
- What?

191
00:25:04,845 --> 00:25:07,004
Cell-phone,
I think I left it at the front desk.

192
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:10,139
- Watch my stuff for a sec?
- Yeah, yeah.

193
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:12,756
- So you're staying an extra few days.
- What?

194
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:18,271
- I couldn't help but overhear. - So you're
spying on my personal conversations now?

195
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,771
Something about the asshole-buyers
not being completely convinced?

196
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:25,102
Now they wanna hear about other pitches?

197
00:25:26,655 --> 00:25:28,149
Sorry about that.

198
00:25:29,574 --> 00:25:32,325
I knew things was too good
to be true anyway.

199
00:25:32,784 --> 00:25:35,572
I'm sorry about the circumstances,
bu I'm glad you're still in town-

200
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:40,282
-because it gives me the opportunity to tell
you how embarrassed I am about last night.

201
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:41,874
See...

202
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,164
See... the thing is...

203
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:47,251
I liked you.

204
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,966
I kind of enjoyed talking
to someone, you know.

205
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,712
- Just talking.
- Really?

206
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:57,677
And yet...

207
00:25:59,056 --> 00:26:02,805
... I tell you about my dead son,
and you mock it.

208
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:08,637
I lost my wife...

209
00:26:10,107 --> 00:26:12,894
I was 24 years old, I was drunk...

210
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:16,231
...I crashed our car into an old tree.

211
00:26:18,864 --> 00:26:21,355
And since then I've...

212
00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:25,820
...soiled my way through life,
being a magnifically cold moron.

213
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:29,329
I run away from emotions.

214
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:31,620
Thus, you tell me about your dead son...

215
00:26:31,665 --> 00:26:34,999
...I tell you a joke about a 15 inch shlong.

216
00:26:37,754 --> 00:26:39,331
So, you can forgive me?

217
00:26:39,422 --> 00:26:41,000
Got it!

218
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:45,338
- It's better I remember it now,
before I leave? - Right.

219
00:26:45,677 --> 00:26:47,966
- Okey, speak to you tomorrow?
- Yeah.

220
00:26:48,597 --> 00:26:50,588
- It's gonna be alright.
- I know.

221
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,559
Danny! Hey... wait, Danny!

222
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:04,900
I've got an extra ticket
to the bullfight this afternoon.

223
00:27:04,942 --> 00:27:06,485
It's supposed to be a good one.

224
00:27:06,528 --> 00:27:08,650
It would mean a great deal
if you could join me.

225
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:15,325
Thank you... thank you very much.
That's very nice of you, and I...

226
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:19,318
- ...I can't, I have work.
- On a sunday afternoon?

227
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:23,996
- Never seen a bullfight?
- No.

228
00:27:24,668 --> 00:27:28,533
You've never seen the real Mexico-city,
until you've seen a bullfight.

229
00:27:30,922 --> 00:27:32,665
Come on...

230
00:28:19,295 --> 00:28:21,038
Bean is not gonna believe this!

231
00:28:21,797 --> 00:28:23,705
I can't wait to tell her.

232
00:28:24,508 --> 00:28:28,504
Where did you find a woman like that?
A woman you can share everything with.

233
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:30,212
She's pretty special.

234
00:28:30,345 --> 00:28:33,132
Then you must be too,
I could learn from you.

235
00:28:33,889 --> 00:28:35,052
Learn what?

236
00:28:35,225 --> 00:28:37,382
Do you want my mortgage,
my blood-pressure?

237
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,476
If I'd ever had my blood-pressure taken-

238
00:28:40,521 --> 00:28:43,854
- I wouldn't have a mortgage for all the
teenage-girls in Thailand.

239
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,562
- You don't own a house?
- No house.

240
00:28:47,234 --> 00:28:49,606
No apartment, no address.

241
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,233
- You're bullshitting me?
- No, I shit you not.

242
00:28:53,281 --> 00:28:57,325
- Want a cigar?
- Yeah... thanks.

243
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,987
If you don't have a permanent
address, where do you live?

244
00:29:01,204 --> 00:29:02,828
I live wherever I'm working.

245
00:29:02,872 --> 00:29:04,579
So what do you do, Julian?

246
00:29:04,623 --> 00:29:07,375
What do you possibly do, if you don't have
a permanent home or address?

247
00:29:12,755 --> 00:29:14,463
I'd rather not say.

248
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:18,379
Oh, my God! Did you see that?

249
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:20,634
Jeez, it's so bloody.

250
00:29:20,678 --> 00:29:23,513
Yeah, they're lucky,
that matador was very good.

251
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:26,170
- It's much worse when they're mediocre.
- Why?

252
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:29,807
A great matador can kill a bull
with one plunge on the brain.

253
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:33,477
A less one, he's have to plunge
that blade more than once.

254
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,020
That makes the crowd very unhappy.

255
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:39,684
- They don't like to see the bull suffer.
- No.

256
00:29:41,528 --> 00:29:44,363
They clearly care so very much
about these animals.

257
00:29:44,573 --> 00:29:46,446
They respect these beasts.

258
00:29:46,865 --> 00:29:49,866
- They want them to die with honor.
- That's ridiculous.

259
00:29:49,994 --> 00:29:52,151
There's no honor by being killed
by a man with a sword, -

260
00:29:52,246 --> 00:29:53,823
- weather it's 1 plunge or 20.

261
00:29:54,164 --> 00:29:56,618
You're wrong...
You're very wrong.

262
00:29:57,499 --> 00:29:59,824
- There is honor.
- And how would you know?

263
00:30:02,587 --> 00:30:04,330
I do...

264
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:09,498
You're a mysterious man, Julian.

265
00:30:14,806 --> 00:30:19,513
- And you don't want to tell me what you do?
- It's... confidential.

266
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:23,720
Confidential? Is your work confidential,
or do you work for the government?

267
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:25,928
Government... please.

268
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:27,523
You know what they pay?

269
00:30:28,442 --> 00:30:30,517
Forget it, watch the picadors.

270
00:30:30,861 --> 00:30:32,484
Are you a spy or something like that?

271
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:34,651
You read to many novels, Danny.

272
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:37,690
Are you a spy?

273
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,575
You're not gonna tell me,
it's okey...

274
00:30:44,996 --> 00:30:46,870
It's okey.

275
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:52,702
It's alright...

276
00:30:53,379 --> 00:30:55,869
- If I tell you, will you keep cool?
- What do you mean?

277
00:30:56,172 --> 00:30:59,505
We're on a public place,
and I don't want you to lose your shit.

278
00:31:00,468 --> 00:31:02,210
Lose my shit?

279
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,549
My God, what are you gonna tell me?

280
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,506
Sometimes...

281
00:31:13,062 --> 00:31:15,847
- Sometimes, what?
- Sometimes...

282
00:31:16,939 --> 00:31:19,478
... people need to be eliminated...

283
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:24,479
Oh, come on!

284
00:31:27,865 --> 00:31:32,111
- What, you're a hitman?
- Oh, please... please.

285
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,406
My handler calls me a "facilitator".

286
00:31:37,248 --> 00:31:39,489
"Facilitator" of fatalities.

287
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:42,625
- That's insane.
- Think what you like.

288
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:46,368
I've got to hand it to you Julian, you're
one of the best bullshit-artists I ever met.

289
00:31:46,422 --> 00:31:49,173
- And I've met some.
- You're absolutely right, Danny.

290
00:31:49,257 --> 00:31:53,503
My name is O. Johnson, and I
sell aluminium-siding in Minneapolis.

291
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,385
So you say you actually kill people
for money?

292
00:31:58,431 --> 00:32:01,882
I do what I'm asked to do,
and what makes sense to me.

293
00:32:02,143 --> 00:32:03,601
Kind of like the mob?

294
00:32:03,644 --> 00:32:08,685
I tend to be hired in the more kind of
anonymous, high-paying jobs.

295
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,936
- Cooperate gigs.
- Cooperate gigs?

296
00:32:14,694 --> 00:32:17,398
I'm a great helper at
getting deals closed.

297
00:32:21,784 --> 00:32:24,819
I don't believe you... I don't believe you.

298
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:27,781
- I don't believe on the easter-bunny.
- I don't believe you for a second.

299
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,451
Come on!
Cooperate gigs?

300
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,165
- Think what you will.
- It's ridiculous!

301
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:33,868
- Yes.
- Cooperate gigs.

302
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,331
Yes...! My God...

303
00:32:36,378 --> 00:32:39,748
I knew there was a reason
that I never told anyone what I did.

304
00:32:41,466 --> 00:32:43,293
See that guy over there?

305
00:32:43,468 --> 00:32:45,258
- The fat man and the little girl?
- Yeah.

306
00:32:45,636 --> 00:32:49,847
Say I want him dead,
his family dead, dead... right now.

307
00:32:49,931 --> 00:32:52,339
- Right here.
- Right now? Couldn't happen.

308
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:55,303
I know, but say that you could,
and money is no object.

309
00:32:57,228 --> 00:32:58,937
- Are you sure you wanna know?
- Yeah.

310
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,479
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I want you to "facilitate".

311
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:07,195
Okey, Danny.
Alright, come with me.

312
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:09,279
Lets go.

313
00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:26,412
I'm a big fan of the "gotta pee"-theory
of assassinations.

314
00:33:26,836 --> 00:33:29,588
- "Gotta pee"?
- Everyone's gotta pee.

315
00:33:32,883 --> 00:33:35,255
- Ask me for a cigarette.
- What?

316
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,419
Do it.

317
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,174
- Can I have a cigarette please?
- Sure.

318
00:33:40,264 --> 00:33:42,339
But these things kill you, you know...

319
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,385
Now look around.

320
00:33:50,272 --> 00:33:53,605
- They're scary. - Yes, and no.
- Why?

321
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:56,817
They seem more interested in the
beautiful woman coming and going-

322
00:33:56,944 --> 00:33:59,481
- from the ladies-room.
That's good for us.

323
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:02,649
Just like those men over there
at the concession-stand.

324
00:34:02,783 --> 00:34:06,731
They're only interested in see
us walking there with our wallets open.

325
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,734
No-one is watching the mens-room.

326
00:34:09,871 --> 00:34:12,742
- The "gotta pee"-theory.
- You're catching on.

327
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:15,459
- Now... escape-routes.
- Escape-routes?

328
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:17,124
- You don't wanna get caught, right?
- No, no...

329
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:18,580
- Don't get caught, it sucks.
- Right.

330
00:34:18,628 --> 00:34:20,252
- See the main exit?
- Yeah.

331
00:34:20,296 --> 00:34:22,870
- That's a traffic-jam.
- Where else?

332
00:34:22,924 --> 00:34:24,501
You tell me.

333
00:34:24,592 --> 00:34:27,425
Okey, okey... that door out there.

334
00:34:27,511 --> 00:34:29,384
If it werent' locked.

335
00:34:29,596 --> 00:34:32,300
A vietnamese girl I once knew had her leg 
so locked together-

336
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,631
- that I couldn't get in reach
of the "spring-roll".

337
00:34:34,684 --> 00:34:38,549
Two drinks, and I was at a
"all you can eat buffé".

338
00:34:38,853 --> 00:34:42,138
Every lock can be broken.
It's just a matter of will...

339
00:34:42,189 --> 00:34:43,848
...and weather it's worth it.

340
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:47,559
This looks like it's worth it.

341
00:34:52,114 --> 00:34:54,105
Why are we buying the cigarettes?

342
00:34:54,615 --> 00:34:56,359
Because I wanna smoke.

343
00:34:57,118 --> 00:34:58,825
Come over here.

344
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:03,118
Now, do your shoe-laces on.

345
00:35:07,836 --> 00:35:10,621
What time is our flight
to Florida, Seymore?

346
00:35:12,338 --> 00:35:14,461
I think two o'clock, Derek.

347
00:35:19,303 --> 00:35:21,046
Let's go, Seymore.

348
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:48,233
Holy shit!

349
00:36:31,778 --> 00:36:33,854
- Are you ready?
- Ready for what?

350
00:36:33,946 --> 00:36:36,615
- You wanted to see what I do, right?
- Yes!

351
00:36:37,491 --> 00:36:39,235
Yes, I've been watching...

352
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:44,158
Showtime is over,
the real deal is about to start.

353
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:46,248
"The real deal"?

354
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,873
Showtime is for sissies.

355
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:52,919
But a sissy I'm not.

356
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:57,082
- Come on!
- We got fire!

357
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:58,912
- That's for the distraction.
- Easy.

358
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,252
Fire will distract most cops.

359
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,470
Are you ready to finish what we started?

360
00:37:04,512 --> 00:37:07,633
Julian, that was extremely dangerous...
I think you proved your point.

361
00:37:09,517 --> 00:37:13,017
The cops may have gone to the fire,
but his bodyguard is probably still upfront.

362
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:14,176
Bodyguard?

363
00:37:14,313 --> 00:37:16,638
Those who are afraid of being killed,
always have a bodyguard.

364
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,932
If they didn't... They'd asked you.

365
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:21,556
So, I'd slit the guards throat,
push him back at the bathroom...

366
00:37:24,405 --> 00:37:26,563
And now we're set up for the kill.

367
00:37:30,868 --> 00:37:32,528
Were the hell did you get the knife?

368
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:34,991
It must be number two...

369
00:37:35,038 --> 00:37:38,371
- Okey, joke's over... let's go, Julian!
-Not yet!

370
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,658
Not yet, not yet...

371
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:42,418
Come on, let's get out of here.

372
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:44,619
Don't fuckin' ruin things, okey?

373
00:37:52,135 --> 00:37:54,423
Okey. Julian!

374
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,007
- I asked you to stop this.
- No way, the job's not done.

375
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:01,260
- This is not a job!
- You said money was no object.

376
00:38:03,185 --> 00:38:05,012
Bingo! Was his name...!

377
00:38:05,062 --> 00:38:06,604
- This is what you wanted, right?
- No!

378
00:38:06,647 --> 00:38:08,686
- This is what you helped with.
- I didn't help you!

379
00:38:08,732 --> 00:38:11,223
- Oh, yes you did...
- No, no, no!

380
00:38:14,362 --> 00:38:16,188
Oh God, no...!

381
00:38:26,455 --> 00:38:28,281
Fun, eh?

382
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,117
Come on!

383
00:38:34,586 --> 00:38:36,911
That was incredible,
you scared the hell out of me!

384
00:38:36,963 --> 00:38:40,046
- You liked that, didn't you?
- I really bought it.

385
00:38:40,507 --> 00:38:44,968
A stranger...
just like that!

386
00:38:45,178 --> 00:38:47,466
- A complete stranger.
- Yes, I did...

387
00:38:47,514 --> 00:38:49,802
- I'm not psychotic.
- No, I know, I know...

388
00:38:50,015 --> 00:38:53,514
- Psychopathic perhaps, but not psychotic.
- I don't think you're a psychopath.

389
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,809
I kill people, doesn't that seem a bit
psychopatic to you?

390
00:38:56,896 --> 00:39:00,015
- Yeah, but...
- Don't get the wrong impression...

391
00:39:00,523 --> 00:39:03,311
Just because we share alot, doesn't mean
I'm not unsavory.

392
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,767
No, what you do is unsavory.

393
00:39:05,945 --> 00:39:08,233
You know what they say...
you are what you do.

394
00:39:24,918 --> 00:39:26,626
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

395
00:39:30,674 --> 00:39:32,381
Tell me...

396
00:39:34,093 --> 00:39:37,711
Will Bean stay with you
if this job doesn't come through?

397
00:39:37,846 --> 00:39:39,174
What?

398
00:39:39,222 --> 00:39:43,219
Will Bean stay with you if you continue
this losing-streak without any end?

399
00:39:43,892 --> 00:39:47,675
- If she ever left me, I'd fall apart...
- You're not answering my question.

400
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,564
To be quite honest...

401
00:39:54,234 --> 00:39:57,021
... I don't know how much faith
the woman have left in her.

402
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:05,653
Comforting me?

403
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:11,114
Just change the subject, please.

404
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:13,079
- I will.
- Something sunnier!

405
00:40:13,165 --> 00:40:16,416
Sunnier...! Absolutely.

406
00:40:17,169 --> 00:40:19,293
In fact there's something
I'd wanted to talk to you about.

407
00:40:19,338 --> 00:40:20,748
- A favor, really.
- Sure.

408
00:40:20,797 --> 00:40:24,000
- It's pretty big, it's a pretty big favor.
- It's okey.

409
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,837
See... the thing is...

410
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,796
...I could use your help.

411
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:31,713
- Help with what?
- I'm down here...

412
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:35,268
I finish my other job early,
so I let it be known.

413
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:36,684
- "Let it be known"?
- Yes.

414
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,307
To the powers that made
that I was available.

415
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,894
- The powers of B?
- Yeah, anyway...

416
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:46,439
They called me, emergency...
it has to happen today.

417
00:40:46,985 --> 00:40:48,728
Another job?

418
00:40:51,655 --> 00:40:55,273
The thing is...
I could really use your help.

419
00:41:00,747 --> 00:41:02,455
You're kidding right now?

420
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,246
I'm as serious as an erections-problem.

421
00:41:08,545 --> 00:41:11,082
- I can't help you, Julian.
- You could.

422
00:41:11,464 --> 00:41:14,001
I could, but I can't...
I'm not gonna help you-

423
00:41:14,091 --> 00:41:16,842
- to kill an innocent man.
- Who says he's innocent?

424
00:41:16,884 --> 00:41:18,509
- This is ridiculous!
- You'll just be assisting.

425
00:41:18,553 --> 00:41:20,212
- No!
-You just have to go out...

426
00:41:20,429 --> 00:41:24,675
I'm not listening.
I can't hear you, I can't hear you.

427
00:41:24,807 --> 00:41:26,681
You're being childish.

428
00:41:27,435 --> 00:41:29,262
You're being childish.

429
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,021
You're being childish.
All I'm asking you to do, is just go...

430
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,392
Alright, alright.
I won't tell you.

431
00:41:36,817 --> 00:41:38,442
- Good.
- Won't mention it.

432
00:41:38,485 --> 00:41:39,599
Great!

433
00:41:39,736 --> 00:41:42,061
All I'm saying, that all you have to do
is trip on the street right next to him.

434
00:41:42,113 --> 00:41:43,311
I can't believe you said that...

435
00:41:43,365 --> 00:41:46,779
Just trip and fall in about half an hour so
his body get turned, and look the other way.

436
00:41:46,825 --> 00:41:48,236
No way.

437
00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:52,410
50.000 dollars.
That's what I got paid.

438
00:41:52,456 --> 00:41:53,948
- No!
- It's alot of money.

439
00:41:53,997 --> 00:41:55,622
Cash.
And it could be real interesting.

440
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:57,290
No! I said no!

441
00:41:57,334 --> 00:41:59,077
He's a prick, Danny!
A real prick!

442
00:41:59,127 --> 00:42:03,124
I don't give a darn who he is,
or what he did, or anything like that.

443
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,548
I'm not gonna help you, Julian.
I'm not gonna do that!

444
00:42:07,467 --> 00:42:09,922
And if you bring it up again, I'll leave.

445
00:42:16,516 --> 00:42:17,845
- Fine.
- Fine.

446
00:42:17,893 --> 00:42:20,050
- Change the subject.
- Good, you do.

447
00:42:22,771 --> 00:42:24,514
- Change it...
- You.

448
00:42:24,564 --> 00:42:26,391
- Fine.
- Okey.

449
00:42:28,818 --> 00:42:31,523
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a cheerleader.

450
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,489
Really?
A cheerleader?

451
00:42:36,532 --> 00:42:40,612
Yeah. I wanted to be thrown in the air
and march in the band.

452
00:42:42,913 --> 00:42:44,371
Seriously?

453
00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:51,244
So funny, I've got an brother-inlaw
who's a male cheerleader-fan...

454
00:42:51,544 --> 00:42:53,869
God, Danny!
I'm fuckin' kidding!

455
00:42:53,963 --> 00:42:55,587
I didn't want to be cheerleader!

456
00:42:55,631 --> 00:42:58,999
I don't want to talk about cheerleaders
unless I'm getting in a shower with them.

457
00:42:59,175 --> 00:43:02,129
I wanna talk what I wanted to talk about,
which you don't wanna talk about!

458
00:43:02,178 --> 00:43:04,466
There's nothing to talk about!

459
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,592
Well then... it's nice knowing you.

460
00:43:10,643 --> 00:43:13,312
No... Julian.
Come on.

461
00:43:13,563 --> 00:43:15,140
You're just leaving?
You're gonna leave?

462
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:17,722
- I got business to attend to.
- I really thought...

463
00:43:17,816 --> 00:43:20,271
Nothing... think nothing.

464
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:24,480
Just consider me the best
cocktail-drinker you ever met.

465
00:43:25,113 --> 00:43:26,488
Bye, Danny.

466
00:43:30,243 --> 00:43:32,116
Julian!

467
00:43:40,334 --> 00:43:42,291
So unfortunally I was right.

468
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,660
I finally got in touch with
Al Handren.

469
00:43:44,713 --> 00:43:48,331
She said att her boss's are leaning
towards Cardinous, and his group...

470
00:43:48,382 --> 00:43:50,089
...and not us.

471
00:43:50,676 --> 00:43:55,337
Things may still break in our favor,
their first instinct was to go with us,

472
00:43:55,471 --> 00:43:59,515
but they're getting pretty intense pressure
to sign with a Mexican company.

473
00:43:59,851 --> 00:44:02,519
I'm trying to get Antonio so I can
set up one more meeting -

474
00:44:02,644 --> 00:44:06,059
- with you guys tomorrow.
I call you when I hear something.

475
00:44:06,314 --> 00:44:09,065
So, hang in there... it's not over yet.

476
00:44:35,087 --> 00:44:36,795
Danny!

477
00:44:37,798 --> 00:44:39,624
Danny, it's Julian!

478
00:44:40,926 --> 00:44:43,594
Come on, Danny,
I just want to say I'm sorry.

479
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:46,803
I know it's late,
and I'm a bit fucked up, but...

480
00:44:46,847 --> 00:44:48,555
I'm sorry.

481
00:44:49,265 --> 00:44:51,554
I'm a mess,
I'm a fuckup!

482
00:44:58,314 --> 00:45:01,231
I should'nt have
asked you to help me.

483
00:45:01,858 --> 00:45:06,236
I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed
on your kindness, but please...

484
00:45:06,988 --> 00:45:09,313
Let me tell you I'm sorry.

485
00:45:09,365 --> 00:45:11,156
Let me apologise!

486
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:14,112
Can't you see how
guilty I feel?

487
00:45:16,037 --> 00:45:17,531
Danny!

488
00:45:24,169 --> 00:45:27,003
6 months later

489
00:46:59,663 --> 00:47:01,322
Hello, Julian!

490
00:47:02,915 --> 00:47:04,991
Getting some culture?

491
00:47:06,127 --> 00:47:08,035
Anytime I can.

492
00:47:08,754 --> 00:47:10,296
You look tired.

493
00:47:10,713 --> 00:47:13,714
I am...
I need a break.

494
00:47:13,841 --> 00:47:15,714
What are you sayin', Julian?

495
00:47:15,842 --> 00:47:18,878
Moscow, Las Vegas, Vienna, Philippines...

496
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:21,295
...and now Budapest? I'm exhausted.

497
00:47:21,431 --> 00:47:23,089
You know what it's like...

498
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:26,425
...you take a break,
We go with the younger cheaper kid.

499
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:30,887
If he does alright, then maybe we don't want
you back, when you're ready to get back.

500
00:47:30,938 --> 00:47:32,562
You'll always want me.

501
00:47:32,606 --> 00:47:34,432
No, not always.

502
00:47:34,607 --> 00:47:37,180
Not if we can save a few dollars.

503
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:40,652
Not if it gets sloppy again,
like in Manilla.

504
00:47:40,738 --> 00:47:42,362
That was one time...

505
00:47:42,405 --> 00:47:45,109
It made some people nervous.
It made me nervous.

506
00:47:45,242 --> 00:47:47,150
Well, that's why I need a break.

507
00:47:47,202 --> 00:47:49,443
I don't want to have something like that
happen again.

508
00:47:49,495 --> 00:47:51,737
- It can't.
- I know, but that's what I'm saying...

509
00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:56,365
But I'm fuckin' burnt out,
I'm feeling... shaky.

510
00:47:57,543 --> 00:47:59,369
Can you believe this shit...

511
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:02,374
Can you believe the words
coming out of my mouth?

512
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:05,421
Did you ever think you'd lived
to see the day?

513
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:07,838
I never thought you'd lived to see the day.

514
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,631
There's no retirement-home
for assassins, is there?

515
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:15,221
archery at 4:00, rifle at 5:00,
bird-dinner at 6:00...

516
00:48:15,266 --> 00:48:17,970
Julian, if you leave the game,
even for a while...

517
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:20,016
...I don't know if they'll
let you back in.

518
00:48:20,061 --> 00:48:21,970
And then what the hell are you gonna do?

519
00:48:22,021 --> 00:48:24,346
Waste your days
to pick upp a bunch of teenagers?

520
00:48:24,398 --> 00:48:27,315
For suck'n fuck-sessions,
behind the old navy-store?

521
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,525
- Sounds great to me.
- Julian. Do this job.

522
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:33,570
Do it, because if you don't, you'll
regret it, and I can promise you that.

523
00:48:33,697 --> 00:48:35,405
How do you know?

524
00:48:39,536 --> 00:48:42,108
Just do it, Julian.
Please, do it.

525
00:48:42,454 --> 00:48:44,114
Okey?

526
00:51:10,075 --> 00:51:12,481
We have a problem, mr Randy.

527
00:51:12,993 --> 00:51:18,235
The problem is Julian Noble. It seems
he didn't deliver the portfolio.

528
00:51:19,373 --> 00:51:21,331
Do you know...

529
00:51:21,459 --> 00:51:26,333
...it says it took 53 years
to paint this ceiling.

530
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:30,881
People are upset, mr Randy.

531
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:34,344
Mr Stick is upset.

532
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,389
- Stick knows?
- Mr Stick knows...

533
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,973
Well, he knows we can fix it.

534
00:51:46,563 --> 00:51:50,511
- I'm just the messenger.
- But he knows we can fix it!

535
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:54,770
- We always fix any problems.
- And fix it with Noble.

536
00:51:55,528 --> 00:51:57,152
Ladies...

537
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,564
Alright, I'm gonna replace him.

538
00:52:00,657 --> 00:52:03,326
No... Yes.

539
00:52:03,576 --> 00:52:06,280
You'll replace him,
but no.

540
00:52:07,413 --> 00:52:10,448
Mr Stick have asked for other things.

541
00:52:10,874 --> 00:52:12,700
No, it's ridiculous.

542
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:16,327
Julian has been with us for 22 years,
two little misstakes...

543
00:52:16,379 --> 00:52:20,422
Julian Noble... is a dead man.

544
00:52:34,726 --> 00:52:37,015
Take me, Danny-boy!

545
00:52:53,492 --> 00:52:55,282
Excellent...

546
00:52:58,287 --> 00:53:00,029
Laundry's done...

547
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,839
Tomorrow it's 4 years.

548
00:53:18,303 --> 00:53:20,461
I know...

549
00:53:22,598 --> 00:53:25,350
It's such a long time really,
when you think about it.

550
00:53:28,228 --> 00:53:30,435
It seems like yesterday, right?

551
00:53:32,606 --> 00:53:34,516
Henry was alive...

552
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,240
When I was first in high-school
I told you they'd made fun of me...

553
00:53:46,868 --> 00:53:53,072
When they called me hippo-hips...
played-beans.. the works. 

554
00:53:55,417 --> 00:53:59,497
And even though I did basketball,
and chorus, and...

555
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:03,291
I had a few friends and I acted strong,

556
00:54:04,299 --> 00:54:06,338
I never was...

557
00:54:08,344 --> 00:54:12,423
...because I believed them,
always, every last cruel... word.

558
00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:18,136
And I always thought I would believe them.

559
00:54:19,394 --> 00:54:21,552
Until I met you...

560
00:54:25,233 --> 00:54:27,722
You arrived at 12th grade.

561
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,445
And you told me...

562
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:35,612
That I was pretty, and for the first time
I believed it.

563
00:54:36,617 --> 00:54:38,905
You told me that I was sexy.

564
00:54:40,161 --> 00:54:42,700
You were sexy back there, in the dryer.

565
00:54:43,915 --> 00:54:45,789
And when Henry died...

566
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,824
...you told me to stay strong!

567
00:54:51,005 --> 00:54:53,080
And that we would get through it.

568
00:54:55,382 --> 00:54:57,291
And we did.

569
00:54:58,802 --> 00:55:00,379
We did...

570
00:55:08,518 --> 00:55:12,218
- That's because you never gave up on me.
- I never could.

571
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:16,431
I never will.

572
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:31,190
Who could that be,
at 11:30 at night?

573
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:39,744
Yeah?

574
00:55:39,793 --> 00:55:43,244
- Danny Wright?
- Yes.

575
00:55:43,337 --> 00:55:45,046
Who's there?

576
00:55:45,089 --> 00:55:47,378
Danny, Danny!

577
00:55:47,591 --> 00:55:50,924
Danny, with the large white fanny!

578
00:55:52,096 --> 00:55:54,668
- Julian!
- Would you mind opening up, Danny?

579
00:55:54,806 --> 00:55:58,422
It's freezing out here,
my balls are like bon-bons.

580
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,262
I've always praying you'd remember me.

581
00:56:05,731 --> 00:56:07,309
It's been a spell.

582
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:11,816
- Please, please, come on in.
- Thank you.

583
00:56:20,535 --> 00:56:24,282
I've decided to...
How did you find me?

584
00:56:24,412 --> 00:56:26,322
I've found a whore
with a heart of gold once, -

585
00:56:26,373 --> 00:56:29,907
- I can certainly find Danny Wright's
card in my addressbook.

586
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,622
- Excuse me, I didn't realise.
- It's okey.

587
00:56:37,632 --> 00:56:41,463
- You must be Bean.
- My wife.

588
00:56:49,308 --> 00:56:51,550
I've heard so much about you...

589
00:56:51,935 --> 00:56:53,642
And me, you.

590
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:01,143
There's no doubt you're every bit
as lovely as Danny said.

591
00:57:05,071 --> 00:57:08,274
I always said you were the
luckiest man I ever met.

592
00:57:16,746 --> 00:57:18,787
What are you doing here, Julian?

593
00:57:28,506 --> 00:57:33,297
I really don't know...
I don't know.

594
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:37,971
I hope it's alright I'm being here,
I mean...

595
00:57:38,431 --> 00:57:39,889
... it's at the middle of the night!

596
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,342
- Yes.
- Well...

597
00:57:43,435 --> 00:57:47,017
I could sure use some coffee,
just a cup.

598
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:51,480
Yes, right, of course.
I can get some coffee.

599
00:57:51,567 --> 00:57:52,847
That'd be great!

600
00:57:52,901 --> 00:57:55,606
- Or maybe some whisky?
- That's even better.

601
00:57:56,362 --> 00:57:59,896
- Tonight's the night for whisky then.
- And song and dance...

602
00:58:01,157 --> 00:58:03,114
Well, whisky atleast.

603
00:58:07,204 --> 00:58:10,822
This is really odd.
Really, really odd.

604
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:14,828
- I can ask him to leave.
- We just asked him to stay.

605
00:58:15,753 --> 00:58:19,702
- We could change our minds.
- Why? Do you think he's dangerous?

606
00:58:21,674 --> 00:58:24,509
He's an assassin, Bean.
Of course he's dangerous.

607
00:58:24,927 --> 00:58:28,426
But I mean dangerous, dangerous,
you said he was a nice guy.

608
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:32,339
He is... for an assassin
he's very nice.

609
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:37,604
Fuck!
Fuckety-fuck...

610
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:40,185
What? I'm allowed to curse.

611
00:58:40,231 --> 00:58:44,774
- Especially now. If not now, when?
- True.

612
00:58:44,818 --> 00:58:48,103
It's the fuckin' perfect time
to be fuckin' cursing.

613
00:58:48,571 --> 00:58:52,403
There's a fuckin' killer standing,
in our fuckin' living-room.

614
00:58:56,077 --> 00:58:58,781
Do you think he would show me his gun?

615
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,833
A toast, maybe?

616
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:11,420
To a stranger,
arriving in the middle of the night.

617
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:15,214
- Well, you're not a stranger...
- No, I'm pretty strange.

618
00:59:15,259 --> 00:59:19,257
Be that as it may, you're not a stranger,
Julian. Far from it.

619
00:59:19,972 --> 00:59:24,633
The toast really should be to you, Danny...
and to you, Bean.

620
00:59:24,767 --> 00:59:27,851
For your hospitality, and your warmth.

621
00:59:37,903 --> 00:59:39,729
I never thought I'd see you again, Julian.

622
00:59:40,072 --> 00:59:43,025
I never thought I'd see you again,
Danny, but...

623
00:59:44,367 --> 00:59:47,949
...things change.

624
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:49,947
They just change...

625
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:52,448
Is that...

626
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:57,167
- You saved it.
- I did.

627
00:59:57,585 --> 00:59:59,625
You saved it, I can't believe it.

628
00:59:59,671 --> 01:00:01,710
He still talks about that
all the time.

629
01:00:02,715 --> 01:00:04,706
It touches me that you kept it.

630
01:00:05,216 --> 01:00:06,414
How could I not?

631
01:00:06,467 --> 01:00:08,709
- That was a special day.
- Yes.

632
01:00:09,053 --> 01:00:10,927
So Danny told you
what I did?

633
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,388
Professionally?

634
01:00:15,517 --> 01:00:17,261
Did you bring your gun?

635
01:00:18,853 --> 01:00:22,056
Yes...
As a matter of fact.

636
01:00:22,106 --> 01:00:24,513
- May I see it?
- Really?

637
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:27,477
- Yes, please.
- Honey, he's not just gonna...

638
01:00:27,735 --> 01:00:29,478
- Here, hold...
- Okey.

639
01:00:37,743 --> 01:00:40,115
- Is that a 38?
- Yes, it is.

640
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,453
You know your guns, Bean.

641
01:00:44,082 --> 01:00:47,117
- Yes, well...
- My God...!

642
01:00:47,752 --> 01:00:49,910
You are a magnificient woman.

643
01:00:52,005 --> 01:00:54,791
Bean knows a lot of things about
a lot of things.

644
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,880
Bean, tell me...

645
01:00:57,843 --> 01:01:01,342
Did Danny tell you everything
about our time in Mexico together?

646
01:01:01,387 --> 01:01:03,297
Yes, I'm sure.
Why?

647
01:01:09,019 --> 01:01:11,307
My God, you look great, Danny.

648
01:01:11,938 --> 01:01:13,646
Really great.

649
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:15,230
You do too, Julian.

650
01:01:16,108 --> 01:01:20,318
Oh, no. I look like a Bangkok-hooker, on a
sunday morning, after the navy left town.

651
01:01:20,361 --> 01:01:24,275
But you...life's been good to you,
am I right?

652
01:01:24,656 --> 01:01:26,898
Pretty good, yeah.

653
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:29,904
You have that respect you wanted
back again?

654
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:31,233
I do.

655
01:01:31,329 --> 01:01:33,570
So you got that job
you were in Mexico for?

656
01:01:33,622 --> 01:01:36,160
- We did.
- And your luck?

657
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:39,492
It's better, right?
No more trees in the kitchen?

658
01:01:40,586 --> 01:01:42,495
You told him about that?

659
01:01:42,797 --> 01:01:45,583
And you love Bean more than ever.

660
01:01:46,341 --> 01:01:47,835
That, I do.

661
01:01:47,883 --> 01:01:50,006
Then, what more could you want?

662
01:01:51,344 --> 01:01:52,839
Here's a toast...

663
01:01:52,888 --> 01:01:55,888
...to a man with respect again...

664
01:01:55,932 --> 01:01:59,514
To a woman that's more lovely
than any man deserves.

665
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,267
And to me.

666
01:02:02,188 --> 01:02:04,179
What is the toast to you for?

667
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,936
A toast to a dead man, Bean.

668
01:02:07,816 --> 01:02:10,188
A toast to a dead man...

669
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:15,981
For about 2 months ago
I had a job in Manilla.

670
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,695
Normally, this would make me happy.

671
01:02:18,742 --> 01:02:21,612
I like the hot climate,
and the guys looks like chicks

672
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,155
It's fuckin' fantastic.

673
01:02:23,246 --> 01:02:26,199
The thing was...
I was burnt out.

674
01:02:26,457 --> 01:02:29,493
I didn't know it, I didn't even know
what "burnt out" meant at the time.

675
01:02:29,584 --> 01:02:30,912
But I was!

676
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,630
I was a classic textbook-case.

677
01:02:40,843 --> 01:02:44,756
I was having panic-attacks. I was
completely losing control of myself...

678
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:47,474
I tried to counter this with booze,
of course, but...

679
01:02:47,515 --> 01:02:48,974
Nothing was working...

680
01:02:49,101 --> 01:02:50,677
I drank, and drank, and...

681
01:02:52,645 --> 01:02:55,514
Nothing... I was so feeling edgy.

682
01:02:55,564 --> 01:02:58,136
Still feeling like my head
was gonna explode.

683
01:02:58,358 --> 01:02:59,981
So...

684
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:02,980
I moved on to my other usual diversions.

685
01:03:03,778 --> 01:03:07,396
A wonderful little whore-house.

686
01:03:09,408 --> 01:03:11,697
That wasn't working either.

687
01:03:11,827 --> 01:03:15,361
And a good fuck usually does.
Excuse my french.

688
01:03:16,622 --> 01:03:19,291
So I had this assignment,
nothing special...

689
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:22,417
Some executive.
Someone doesn't want him around.

690
01:03:22,461 --> 01:03:24,251
You know, my usual-type gig.

691
01:03:25,379 --> 01:03:29,756
I knew that this cooperate-guy
always came to a market-

692
01:03:29,841 --> 01:03:31,999
-every thursday, to buy fruit.

693
01:03:33,511 --> 01:03:35,752
The guy liked his fruit.

694
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:49,681
As he walks through the crowds,
I bump into him.. and stab him.

695
01:03:59,782 --> 01:04:02,818
The thing was, I was still a mess.

696
01:04:05,495 --> 01:04:08,366
And every time I looked at the guy,
I didn't see him.

697
01:04:08,414 --> 01:04:10,490
But I saw a little boy instead.

698
01:04:19,465 --> 01:04:21,373
And it wasn't just any boy.

699
01:04:22,926 --> 01:04:26,211
It was me... me, as a child!

700
01:04:29,598 --> 01:04:31,472
Freaky shit, right?

701
01:04:33,977 --> 01:04:36,930
Real nervous breakdown,
sort of stuff.

702
01:04:42,817 --> 01:04:46,482
I stood ready with the knife,
still prepared for the job.

703
01:04:52,409 --> 01:04:54,366
I couldn't do it.

704
01:04:54,494 --> 01:04:56,485
I just couldn't do it.

705
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:09,413
Then what happened?

706
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,415
I woke up in a pile of donkey-shit.

707
01:05:12,966 --> 01:05:16,881
I fainted. I guess I landed in a pile
of donkey-shit.

708
01:05:22,433 --> 01:05:24,140
And since then...

709
01:05:24,225 --> 01:05:26,052
...it's been extremely cold.

710
01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:28,428
Some jobs goes okey...

711
01:05:28,813 --> 01:05:30,686
...others, not so okey.

712
01:05:32,775 --> 01:05:36,143
And, in a few weeks ago,
I fucked up again, in Budapest.

713
01:05:36,194 --> 01:05:39,562
I frooze, right at the moment
I should have been firing.

714
01:05:41,323 --> 01:05:44,358
I didn't finish the job,
and that was that.

715
01:05:45,993 --> 01:05:48,235
Now it's just a matter of time.

716
01:05:50,289 --> 01:05:52,958
Isn't there somebody that you can talk to?

717
01:05:53,415 --> 01:05:55,657
Like Mary Beth in human-resources?

718
01:05:56,418 --> 01:06:00,462
This is insane. Are they gonna kill you
for failing a job?

719
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:04,205
Can't you just... say to them...

720
01:06:05,092 --> 01:06:06,800
"I'm sorry"...

721
01:06:06,969 --> 01:06:10,254
"I was a little burnt out,
and I'm a little messed up"...

722
01:06:10,305 --> 01:06:11,930
Can't you do that?

723
01:06:13,642 --> 01:06:17,175
I mean, you saw images of yourself
as a small boy.

724
01:06:17,478 --> 01:06:20,513
If that is not a nervous breakdown,
I don't know what is.

725
01:06:20,605 --> 01:06:25,182
- Certainly they have to see that.
- No, they don't, they don't.

726
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:31,023
I'd be dead now if my handler hadn't risked
his life and tipped me off the company plan.

727
01:06:31,114 --> 01:06:33,819
I barely got out of Budapest alive.

728
01:06:34,075 --> 01:06:37,821
And how did you end up here...?
In Denver.

729
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:43,198
It's funny.

730
01:06:44,373 --> 01:06:47,873
Some people are at home
in the time of crises.

731
01:06:48,961 --> 01:06:52,910
My problem... problem
I shared with Danny in Mexico...

732
01:06:53,882 --> 01:06:57,048
...is that I don't have a home.
I mean...

733
01:06:59,094 --> 01:07:00,967
That's why I'm here.

734
01:07:02,931 --> 01:07:05,137
You're the only friends I have.

735
01:07:06,058 --> 01:07:10,186
But that's ridiculous...
you have friends.

736
01:07:13,356 --> 01:07:16,356
I don't, I really don't.

737
01:07:17,943 --> 01:07:22,355
You're it,
it's fucking crazy, right?

738
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:25,695
You're my only friends
and I barely know you.

739
01:07:28,285 --> 01:07:29,827
This home...

740
01:07:32,539 --> 01:07:34,365
Your home...

741
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,576
...is the only home I know.

742
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:44,751
She's really fantastic, Danny.

743
01:07:45,591 --> 01:07:48,876
- She's lovely.
- She means everything to me.

744
01:07:49,427 --> 01:07:51,668
You said that to me in Mexico.

745
01:07:52,471 --> 01:07:57,262
I nodded and listened,
but now I see.

746
01:07:58,601 --> 01:08:00,511
I see...

747
01:08:07,775 --> 01:08:11,144
Did you told her everything that
happened in Mexico?

748
01:08:13,321 --> 01:08:16,737
I told her about our time together, yes.

749
01:08:18,743 --> 01:08:21,067
And where does that story end?

750
01:08:24,873 --> 01:08:26,664
She knows the last I heard of you-

751
01:08:26,749 --> 01:08:29,074
- you where knocking on my hotel-room
in the middle of the night-

752
01:08:29,126 --> 01:08:32,043
- asking forgiveness for trying
to involve me in a job.

753
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:39,505
That's what you said?
That I knocked and knocked...

754
01:08:40,302 --> 01:08:44,880
- And you never answered?
- Yes.

755
01:08:46,973 --> 01:08:48,551
Gentlemen!

756
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:52,720
I'm a bit drunk.

757
01:08:53,645 --> 01:08:55,354
It's a nice place to be.

758
01:08:55,522 --> 01:08:58,772
Julian, you will stay the night of course?

759
01:08:59,693 --> 01:09:02,812
Thank you, Bean. I promise
I'll be out of here tomorrow.

760
01:09:02,945 --> 01:09:05,317
Let's not talk about that now.

761
01:09:05,656 --> 01:09:10,401
I don't think I've been up with guests
til 2:30 in the morning... in a long time.

762
01:09:10,452 --> 01:09:13,452
- It's good, right?
- Oh, it's very good.

763
01:09:14,413 --> 01:09:17,781
- Can I turn on your stereo?
- Sure... now?

764
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:22,707
Yeah, I saw an old record of yours that I'd
like to hear in the small hours the morning.

765
01:09:22,961 --> 01:09:27,208
Since we're in the small hours
of the morning, is that okey?

766
01:09:27,548 --> 01:09:30,004
Certainly.
Yes, yes...

767
01:09:44,645 --> 01:09:46,140
Danny?

768
01:09:46,606 --> 01:09:52,274
I hope you approve, I'd really want
to ask your wife for a dance.

769
01:09:55,779 --> 01:09:58,234
Julian, you've had to much to drink.

770
01:10:00,575 --> 01:10:04,323
Bean... please, may I have this dance?

771
01:11:05,003 --> 01:11:09,249
Bravo...! Bravo!

772
01:11:10,549 --> 01:11:14,463
I learnt to dance in a
south-american jail.

773
01:11:14,594 --> 01:11:17,215
Well, that's another story...
another time.

774
01:11:17,429 --> 01:11:18,709
The final night-cap!

775
01:11:18,763 --> 01:11:21,432
I can't even think of
how I'll get up in the morning.

776
01:11:21,474 --> 01:11:23,016
Then don't!
What you do...

777
01:11:23,059 --> 01:11:26,012
take 3 aspirins in a row,
before you go to bed tonight.

778
01:11:26,061 --> 01:11:29,512
Where'd you hear that one?
Assassins book of home-remedys?

779
01:11:34,527 --> 01:11:36,851
The only woman that I ever loved...

780
01:11:37,029 --> 01:11:38,653
...my mother.

781
01:11:39,322 --> 01:11:41,279
What about your wife?

782
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:43,612
My wife?

783
01:11:43,701 --> 01:11:47,199
Danny told me that you were married,
and that she died in a car-accident.

784
01:11:47,245 --> 01:11:48,703
You loved her!

785
01:12:01,423 --> 01:12:03,001
Oh, my God!

786
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,087
- I can't believe this!
- I was never married.

787
01:12:06,511 --> 01:12:07,886
I can't believe this...

788
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:10,425
- There wasn't a car-accident?
- No.

789
01:12:10,472 --> 01:12:13,888
I'd been insensitive to Danny, about your
son, and I was trying to win him over-

790
01:12:13,933 --> 01:12:17,467
- it was juvenile, stupid. - You know what,
Julian, I'm the one that was stupid!

791
01:12:17,686 --> 01:12:20,557
No, no, no, you're not stupid.
I'm a prick!

792
01:12:20,605 --> 01:12:22,230
It's me, not you!

793
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:25,976
I could have kept lying now,
but I chose not to, as a sign of..

794
01:12:26,236 --> 01:12:29,900
-respect... because now, we're friends.

795
01:12:32,074 --> 01:12:33,781
We are friends, aren't we?

796
01:12:34,659 --> 01:12:37,030
What other bullshit
did you pour over me, Julian?

797
01:12:37,077 --> 01:12:38,821
Are you even a hitman, Julian?

798
01:12:41,664 --> 01:12:43,039
-or what the fuck you call yourself.

799
01:12:43,541 --> 01:12:46,114
Yes, I am.
Is that the answer to your question, Danny?

800
01:12:46,669 --> 01:12:49,622
I lie when I need to.
And tell the truth when I can.

801
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:51,414
With you...

802
01:12:52,924 --> 01:12:55,212
It's mostly been the truth.

803
01:13:04,183 --> 01:13:05,725
Should I go?

804
01:13:11,272 --> 01:13:13,263
- No.
- No.

805
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:23,235
Aren't we fucking cosmopolitan?

806
01:13:24,198 --> 01:13:27,366
Having a trained assassin,
stay over the night?

807
01:13:27,743 --> 01:13:32,321
Letting heartbreaking lies
roll over us, like the summer-breeze.

808
01:13:32,747 --> 01:13:35,072
Next we should be wife-swapping?

809
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:40,543
You don't have a wife...
remember?

810
01:13:48,176 --> 01:13:50,300
That's a good point.

811
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:09,817
Danny... Danny!

812
01:14:16,115 --> 01:14:18,867
- Danny!
- No.. I have...

813
01:14:19,536 --> 01:14:21,908
Come on, I got to talk to you.

814
01:14:25,582 --> 01:14:27,290
What's it, Julian?
What do you want?

815
01:14:27,375 --> 01:14:30,411
- I can't talk about it here.
- What?

816
01:14:30,502 --> 01:14:31,831
Come on!

817
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:39,290
Okey, Julian, we're in your rental-car.
What is it?

818
01:14:39,343 --> 01:14:43,175
The thing is, Danny...
the thing I didn't tell you.

819
01:14:43,931 --> 01:14:46,765
The thing I hide,
because Bean was present.

820
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,644
Was that I've been offered a way out
of my fatal situation.

821
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:54,229
- That's good.
- Yeah, I know.

822
01:14:54,272 --> 01:14:56,809
That's really good, what is it?

823
01:14:57,483 --> 01:15:00,851
My handler, mr Randy, contacted me
like he always does.

824
01:15:00,902 --> 01:15:04,235
With an add in the international tribune
looking cat-salers in Bali.

825
01:15:04,363 --> 01:15:08,112
Is that how you stayed in contact?
Cats or the rats?

826
01:15:08,127 --> 01:15:09,368
Yeah.

827
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:12,987
Okey, this is ridiculous,
I'm so tired, Julian.

828
01:15:14,163 --> 01:15:17,946
He contacted me 4 days ago, and basically,
he said he's been at the higher-ups.

829
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:20,702
And got me a reprieve.

830
01:15:20,835 --> 01:15:23,705
Well like I said,
that's great news!

831
01:15:23,754 --> 01:15:28,130
The thing is, he's asking me
to do one more job.

832
01:15:28,467 --> 01:15:31,038
I have no choice,
it's do the job, or else...

833
01:15:32,219 --> 01:15:35,172
And it brings us to the
dirty little problem.

834
01:15:39,934 --> 01:15:41,214
What's the problem?

835
01:15:41,269 --> 01:15:43,261
Well, actually it's a pretty big problem.

836
01:15:43,478 --> 01:15:44,937
And you really not gonna like it.

837
01:15:45,438 --> 01:15:47,348
- I'm not gonna like it?
- Not at all.

838
01:15:48,273 --> 01:15:52,687
Because the job... involves you.

839
01:15:57,114 --> 01:15:59,190
You're not saying,
what I think you're saying?

840
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:02,281
What do you think I'm saying?

841
01:16:02,828 --> 01:16:05,034
You know what I think you're saying...

842
01:16:05,371 --> 01:16:08,621
No, I don't think I know what you think,
I'm saying.

843
01:16:10,584 --> 01:16:12,660
Someone wants me dead?

844
01:16:24,554 --> 01:16:26,842
No, no one wants you dead, Danny!

845
01:16:35,687 --> 01:16:38,357
But I need your help
in facilitating the fatality.

846
01:16:38,398 --> 01:16:40,023
- What?
- I need your help.

847
01:16:40,067 --> 01:16:42,438
No, no, my help is exacly
what you don't need.

848
01:16:42,485 --> 01:16:44,607
I'm a mess, Danny.
You know that.

849
01:16:44,653 --> 01:16:47,938
I'm a complete mess,
I don't know if I can do this job by myself.

850
01:16:47,989 --> 01:16:50,776
You got to talk to somebody else,
a college!

851
01:16:50,825 --> 01:16:52,652
- I don't know any colleges.
- You must!

852
01:16:52,702 --> 01:16:55,192
- I don't.
- Well, I can't help you!

853
01:16:55,496 --> 01:16:57,738
Danny, I know you're not
the ideal-candidate.

854
01:16:57,789 --> 01:17:02,534
Ideal? Far, far from ideal, Julian.
Don't you remember my reaction-

855
01:17:02,585 --> 01:17:05,040
-the last time you proposed something
this utterly stupid?

856
01:17:05,086 --> 01:17:07,659
It was just in Mexico,
I was just trying to show you a good time!

857
01:17:07,713 --> 01:17:10,252
So now, killing somebody is a good time?

858
01:17:10,633 --> 01:17:12,256
It can be.

859
01:17:12,718 --> 01:17:14,840
- I'm going to sleep.
- Danny! Come on...

860
01:17:14,885 --> 01:17:16,510
Why do you need a second person?

861
01:17:16,554 --> 01:17:19,009
Haven't you done all these things yourself?

862
01:17:19,056 --> 01:17:21,013
Some jobs are better with two men.

863
01:17:21,058 --> 01:17:24,141
Well, I think it's better that the
2nd man isn't scared shitless...

864
01:17:24,185 --> 01:17:27,969
...and unprepared, and unqualified,
I'm not interested-

865
01:17:28,022 --> 01:17:29,646
-I'm gonna go to bed, Julian.

866
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:32,061
I'm in a very dangerous
position here, Danny.

867
01:17:32,108 --> 01:17:34,350
I'm in no shape to try this myself.

868
01:17:34,402 --> 01:17:37,487
An assassin without confidence
is a horrible thing to behold.

869
01:17:37,821 --> 01:17:40,109
It's like a relief-picture
who fumbles the ball.

870
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:44,363
Please, tell me you know you mixed
2 sports in your metaphor.

871
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:46,697
I can't do that.

872
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:52,285
Danny, please, please!
I need your help!

873
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:54,914
Someone's gonna die.
A stranger, or me.

874
01:17:55,127 --> 01:17:56,704
Which would you rather?

875
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:02,168
Look, if I can do the job successfully,
I'm free and clear.

876
01:18:02,216 --> 01:18:03,758
Free and clear, Danny!

877
01:18:03,801 --> 01:18:06,671
I have enough money saved up
to retire to a beautiful greek island-

878
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,344
-with beautiful little greeks.

879
01:18:08,388 --> 01:18:10,795
Heaven awaits me, Danny,
if you and I do this job.

880
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:13,345
- I can't!
- God damnit, Danny!

881
01:18:13,892 --> 01:18:15,931
- You're my only friend!
- Julian...!

882
01:18:15,976 --> 01:18:17,720
It's true, and...

883
01:18:20,147 --> 01:18:21,725
- What?
- And...

884
01:18:25,151 --> 01:18:26,859
You owe me...

885
01:18:31,198 --> 01:18:34,531
- If this would happen,
when would it take place? - Today.

886
01:18:34,951 --> 01:18:36,694
The horse-races.

887
01:18:37,579 --> 01:18:39,570
- Today?
- Yeah, in Arizona.

888
01:18:39,956 --> 01:18:41,947
No, no, that couldn't happen, Julian.

889
01:18:42,249 --> 01:18:43,624
No choice.

890
01:18:43,708 --> 01:18:47,408
No, today is the 4 year anniversary
of my son Henry's death.

891
01:18:47,877 --> 01:18:49,669
We go to the semetary.

892
01:18:49,754 --> 01:18:51,830
What time does the semetary close, Danny?

893
01:18:52,883 --> 01:18:54,340
I don't know...

894
01:18:54,466 --> 01:18:57,005
We'll have you back here 4:30,
I promise you.

895
01:18:57,052 --> 01:18:59,341
Oh, you do that, okey...

896
01:18:59,471 --> 01:19:01,380
Well, how will you do that, Julian?

897
01:19:01,973 --> 01:19:04,808
We have a 7:40 plane-reservation
to Tucson this morning.

898
01:19:05,184 --> 01:19:06,926
Plenty of time to catch the 2:30 back.

899
01:19:06,977 --> 01:19:08,435
We do?

900
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,975
I made it yesterday, first class.

901
01:19:11,021 --> 01:19:13,809
Real fancy, now, chop-chop, upstairs,

902
01:19:13,857 --> 01:19:15,601
get dressed, make a story up to Bean.

903
01:19:16,777 --> 01:19:18,852
We got to get this road on the show.

904
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:07,074
I just leaned against that.
I was yawning and I just..

905
01:21:07,783 --> 01:21:10,405
Turn it off!
I'm sorry...

906
01:24:07,012 --> 01:24:09,089
Hey... Julian!

907
01:24:18,981 --> 01:24:20,972
Julian!

908
01:24:23,483 --> 01:24:25,026
Julian!

909
01:24:32,742 --> 01:24:34,319
Julian?

910
01:24:38,496 --> 01:24:40,370
What the hell is going on?

911
01:24:41,082 --> 01:24:42,457
Julian?

912
01:24:46,295 --> 01:24:48,619
You drag me out to Arizona.

913
01:24:49,212 --> 01:24:51,584
To the god-damned horse-races?

914
01:24:52,466 --> 01:24:54,504
To do this job, right?

915
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:57,124
To do this job, right.
To do this one last job...

916
01:24:58,179 --> 01:25:00,136
To kill somebody I don't even know-

917
01:25:00,181 --> 01:25:02,671
-so that you could live out
the rest of your life with greeks!

918
01:25:02,766 --> 01:25:04,924
Beautiful little greeks standing...

919
01:25:04,976 --> 01:25:08,344
We do... I do everything perfectly.
Not you... me! Perfectly.

920
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,394
Did you see me, Julian?
I was brilliant!

921
01:25:11,022 --> 01:25:13,062
You got a clean shot,
I know you had a clean shot.

922
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,064
And you don't take it!
What's going on?

923
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,889
I've lost it, Danny.

924
01:25:16,944 --> 01:25:19,186
Really?
Then they're gonna kill you, Julian.

925
01:25:19,779 --> 01:25:21,357
But I've lost it...

926
01:25:21,739 --> 01:25:24,609
- That's an unacceptable answer!
- But it's the truth.

927
01:25:24,659 --> 01:25:26,283
Oh, please...

928
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:31,075
Concentrate here, okey?
I need you to concentrate.

929
01:25:32,165 --> 01:25:34,999
Just look at me, Danny.
Look at me... I'm a wreck!

930
01:25:35,084 --> 01:25:37,291
- I'm a parody.
- Julian!

931
01:25:38,003 --> 01:25:40,375
- You got to get up there,
and finish this job. - No, no, no.

932
01:25:40,421 --> 01:25:43,505
No, just leave me alone, Danny.
Please, just forget everything.

933
01:25:44,592 --> 01:25:46,583
I can't believe,
I'm in a stairway-

934
01:25:46,634 --> 01:25:49,469
-  trying to convince you to
assassinate somebody!

935
01:25:50,096 --> 01:25:52,586
Just go... just go... go.

936
01:26:05,734 --> 01:26:07,062
No.

937
01:26:07,819 --> 01:26:12,194
- No, we're gonna do this.
- My God!

938
01:26:12,322 --> 01:26:15,157
Julian, you have to... you have to, okey?

939
01:26:15,242 --> 01:26:17,732
If you don't, they're gonna kill you,
do you understand me?

940
01:26:17,952 --> 01:26:19,231
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

941
01:26:19,828 --> 01:26:22,402
And I won't let that happen.

942
01:26:22,831 --> 01:26:25,701
I refuse to let that happen,
how about that?

943
01:26:26,584 --> 01:26:29,455
We're gonna walk there together,
and I'll talk you through it.

944
01:26:29,504 --> 01:26:33,451
Okey? I'm gonna talk you right through it,
and you're gonna do the job.

945
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:36,960
- Okey? - Yes.
- Okey, alright!

946
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,877
Okey...

947
01:26:42,556 --> 01:26:44,299
Up, up, up!

948
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:47,601
There you go.
Okey?

949
01:26:47,643 --> 01:26:50,311
- And you gonna stay up there with me.
- Yes, yes, yes.

950
01:26:54,314 --> 01:26:57,399
- Thank you.
- Alright, then...

951
01:26:57,443 --> 01:27:00,857
Let's go kill this fucker already,
and get the hell out of here!

952
01:27:22,254 --> 01:27:23,665
Thank you.

953
01:27:25,507 --> 01:27:27,380
Really, I mean it.

954
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:30,300
I was a mess back there.

955
01:27:30,928 --> 01:27:34,971
You helped me.
You helped me alot.

956
01:27:38,725 --> 01:27:41,347
You know I think I can
handle the deviant-Julian.

957
01:27:42,062 --> 01:27:43,805
I can handle the lying-Julian.

958
01:27:43,855 --> 01:27:46,523
I can even handle the killing-Julian.

959
01:27:46,982 --> 01:27:50,398
I just don't know if I can handle
the weak-Julian.

960
01:27:52,488 --> 01:27:55,025
Well, enjoy it. It won't last...

961
01:27:55,614 --> 01:27:57,275
That's a given.

962
01:28:00,952 --> 01:28:04,451
Really...
it's no problem.

963
01:28:06,457 --> 01:28:10,583
You said it yourself..
I owed you.

964
01:28:12,712 --> 01:28:15,996
Do you think, if you hadn't open that door
late that night in Mexico city-

965
01:28:16,047 --> 01:28:18,502
- the two of us would be sitting
on this plane now?

966
01:28:22,219 --> 01:28:23,796
Probably not.

967
01:28:28,142 --> 01:28:30,713
Come on, Danny!
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

968
01:28:30,768 --> 01:28:33,721
I know it's late,
and I'm a little fucked up, but...

969
01:28:33,978 --> 01:28:35,603
I'm sorry...

970
01:28:35,856 --> 01:28:38,097
Can't you see how guilty I feel?

971
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:40,681
Danny!

972
01:28:41,485 --> 01:28:44,819
- Danny!
- Hold on, Julian! I'm coming.

973
01:28:49,617 --> 01:28:52,368
I don't know what'll I do
if I don't get this job.

974
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:59,533
And you're sure if I kill off this guy,
you'll get the contract?

975
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:01,416
It's the only competition.

976
01:29:01,709 --> 01:29:03,786
And you can live with that?

977
01:29:04,963 --> 01:29:07,749
- Yeah.
- You can live with that blood on you hands?

978
01:29:09,841 --> 01:29:14,586
That's what people do.
Dumb people...

979
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:19,759
and successful people...
always live with blood on their hands?

980
01:29:24,437 --> 01:29:27,009
You became my friend that night, Julian.

981
01:29:27,982 --> 01:29:30,353
You became my life-long friend...

982
01:29:49,582 --> 01:29:51,788
I'm not going to do it for you.

983
01:29:52,709 --> 01:29:57,288
You're making it on a late night...
an exhausted desperate decision.

984
01:29:57,380 --> 01:30:00,831
And if I did it...
You would regret it instantly.

985
01:30:01,259 --> 01:30:05,172
And feel guilt and shame
for the rest of you life, believe me.

986
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:09,137
I'm so scared, Julian.

987
01:30:10,724 --> 01:30:12,301
Guys like you...

988
01:30:13,351 --> 01:30:15,011
...you think you've no luck?

989
01:30:15,228 --> 01:30:17,304
But you got all the luck in the world.

990
01:30:18,981 --> 01:30:20,854
You just need to see it.

991
01:30:21,984 --> 01:30:24,106
She's at home,
waiting for you.

992
01:30:26,362 --> 01:30:28,105
If I did that job for you...

993
01:30:28,155 --> 01:30:31,606
...your luck would run bad,
for the rest of your days.

994
01:30:34,285 --> 01:30:36,656
You don't really wanna do it anyway,
I know you don't.

995
01:30:36,996 --> 01:30:38,869
You're not that type of person.

996
01:30:45,335 --> 01:30:47,458
That's why I like you.

997
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:51,251
You're the exact opposite of me.

998
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:57,501
You surprised me that night.

999
01:30:58,180 --> 01:31:00,218
I surprised myself.

1000
01:31:04,727 --> 01:31:06,967
I guess your boss must be satisfied, right?

1001
01:31:07,771 --> 01:31:11,933
You completed the assignment...
no longer on the hit-list.

1002
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:18,063
Well, I'm no longer on the hit-list,
but I didn't do any assignment.

1003
01:31:19,947 --> 01:31:24,904
I don't understand, I thought your boss
wanted you to do this job!

1004
01:31:28,495 --> 01:31:34,663
My boss, mr Stick...
he was the job.

1005
01:31:37,253 --> 01:31:40,502
- Do you mean we just killed...
- We killed the man who wanted to kill me.

1006
01:31:42,049 --> 01:31:43,839
Problem solved.

1007
01:31:48,928 --> 01:31:50,672
You...

1008
01:31:52,474 --> 01:31:54,799
You son of a bitch!

1009
01:31:55,185 --> 01:31:57,011
Among many other things...

1010
01:31:57,687 --> 01:32:00,686
- Don't ever hit me again.
- Sorry...

1011
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,718
