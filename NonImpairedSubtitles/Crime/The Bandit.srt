1
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,429
Thirty-five years ago,
a gang of bandits...

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,952
were caught by the gendarme
on Cudi mountain.

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,838
In the course of
these thirty-five years,

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:32,430
illness and prison violence
wiped off all the bandits.

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,276
All but one...

6
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,429
Mother Ceran. Is that you?

7
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,750
Yeah. Who are you?

8
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,678
It's Baran.

9
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,156
Baran. The Bandit, you are back?

10
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,916
I'm back Mother Ceran. What
happened to the village?

11
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,832
The water came. Covered everything.
They said ''Go away from here.''

12
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,675
Everyone has deserted the village.
I, alone, stayed here.

13
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,799
I told them not to go.
They wouldn't listen.

14
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,269
Things turned bad after you went
to jail. Evil won the day.

15
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,675
The weak were trampled on.

16
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,592
Where is Mustafa, Ceran?

17
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,318
Left for the city, long time ago...

18
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,912
This place is finished.
Everything's sunk.

19
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,518
Our graves will be next.

20
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,873
Come with me. You'll be
food for the beasts here.

21
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,913
The beasts are of us. Evil is
elsewhere.

22
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,399
I am the madwoman of
this place. I cannot go anywhere.

23
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,153
You're heading for trouble.

24
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,197
I said the same to your father.
I told him ''They'll trap you.''

25
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,837
He wouldn't listen. He went and
didn't come back.

26
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:47,793
Now if I say ''Don't go!'' You'll go.
I know you will.

27
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,393
Take this, Bandit. It will
protect you from bullets.

28
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,274
Are you going to kill me, Bandit?

29
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,233
Aye Mustafa. I will.

30
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,272
Do you have a gun?

31
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,589
I do.

32
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,518
Give it to me.

33
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,514
Why did you inform on me,
brother Mustafa?

34
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,439
Stupidity, poverty, call it what
you like. This has been killing me.

35
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,352
I can't sleep.
You visit me every night.

36
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,829
I hear your footsteps behind
me. I'm tired of watching my back.

37
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,870
People call me informer. I've lost
face. Even my children shun me.

38
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,391
Why did you do it?

39
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,709
I caved in for a few gold pieces.
Shame on those who forced me.

40
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,309
Who forced you?

41
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,310
I was sworn not to tell, but it
doesn't matter anymore.

42
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,433
Berfo made me do it.

43
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,477
Berfo?

44
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,871
Berfo! He is the one who asked
me to inform on you.

45
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,718
Woe, brother Berfo...

46
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,956
Why did he do it?

47
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,559
To steal Keje from you.

48
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,516
Did Keje go with him?

49
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,315
Yeah. she went with him.
After you went to jail...

50
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,195
Berfo took your gold, then
he went to Keje's father.

51
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,393
I begged him not to. I said ''Keje
is Bandit's girl. Spare her at least.''

52
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,315
He said, ''Fool! I did it all for Keje.''

53
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,235
He took the gold and Keje,
and he disappeared.

54
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,830
Then we heard
he went to Istanbul.

55
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,714
So, this is the thirty year story.

56
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,508
So Keje went with him.

57
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,358
Her father made her go.
She became Berfo's.

58
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,072
We put you in jail. I made a
mistake. I was starved.

59
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,433
Still I'm starved brother.
Bad luck, that gold was.

60
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,951
All went to women and gambling,
All of it.

61
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:55,434
Our village was covered with dam
water. Everyone was scattered around.

62
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,392
No-one knows who is where.

63
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,711
I'm groveling here as you see.

64
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,438
Anyway, thank god it will all end
now. Come on, finish it off.

65
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,189
Bandit... Bandit.

66
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,153
I can't wait any
longer. Kill me...

67
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,834
Bandit! ....

68
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,709
Greetings.

69
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,433
Hello.

70
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,152
Here. You smoke?

71
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,709
Have one of these, uncle.

72
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,032
No... Please.
please take one of these.

73
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,556
Where are you heading, uncle?

74
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,757
Istanbul, God willing.

75
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,871
Yeah, you're the only one missing
anyway.

76
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,798
Oh my God! Shit! The police.
What shall I do now?..

77
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,110
Bring this bag to
Kismet Garage in Tarlabas i.

78
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,238
Bring this to Kismet Garage
Car mechanic's.

79
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,158
For God's sake!

80
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,512
Please... It's life or death
uncle. I'm begging you please.

81
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,518
I'll pay you a lot.
Please do it man!

82
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,072
-Stop! Police.
-What is this, man?..

83
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,719
Shut up! Cut it out! Go on!

84
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,675
Just a moment. There's a mistake.
What's the charge?

85
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,716
Come on brother.
Where are you taking me man?

86
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,309
I'm off the train, nicely going
home.

87
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,189
Excuse me, can I ask something?
What have I done now?

88
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,075
Clean?

89
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,748
Clean.

90
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,116
He's clean, inspector.

91
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,079
Come on, talk man!

92
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,157
Talk what brother?

93
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,072
You! Did you sell us out, you?

94
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,436
No! I swear. There's no such
thing brother Demircan.

95
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,830
How can you give the stuff costing
billions to just anyone in the street?

96
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,793
The police surrounded me.
Honestly, I swear...

97
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,270
I wasn't afraid of getting caught.
It was for the stuff.

98
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,078
Or? Are you a police mole?

99
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,914
What are you saying brother? That's
the guy's suitcase over there.

100
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,152
What did we do? Didn't we send out
two couriers and tipped...

101
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,595
the cops on
on the wrong one?

102
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,758
How come the cops didn't go after
the decoy then? And got you?

103
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,592
This was only your first job. Talk!
Are you an informer? Say it!

104
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,758
Bring him in.

105
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,197
Forgive me brother.
I had trouble finding the place.

106
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,670
That's him! That's the guy!

107
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,757
It is my first time in Istanbul.

108
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,475
Okay. The stuff is here.

109
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,471
Wow! That was a close one.

110
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,518
What's happened to this thing?

111
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,791
It had an accident. I'm sorry.

112
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,395
Here. It was a promise. Buy
yourself new suitcase.

113
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,675
No. I don't want it.

114
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,633
Take it. You have no idea what you
saved me from. Thanks.

115
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,593
Wasn't trouble at all.

116
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,394
Almost had it man. Yours truly
almost would've had it.

117
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,948
Huh?

118
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,433
Nevermind. Okay. Thanks

119
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,958
I'll be off now uncle if it's okay
with you.

120
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,588
What are you doing?

121
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,309
Just looking.

122
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,709
What at?

123
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,957
Where am I now?

124
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,832
Tarlabas i.

125
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,669
Well... Okay.

126
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,429
Where will you go now?

127
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,157
I don't know really. I'm looking
for a place to stay.

128
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,515
A hotel?

129
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,751
Right, friend. Some place
cheap you know.

130
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,270
Ah! Okay. Come with me.

131
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,594
God bless you, brother.
I felt a little strange you know.

132
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,235
Come with me, uncle. Don't worry.

133
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,474
I did it four times.

134
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,393
Big deal.

135
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,360
Cut the crap you two.

136
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,518
You should never trust a woman.
They always cocktease.

137
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,591
-How did it go?
-It was taken care of.

138
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,353
-Is the job done?
-What job?

139
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,271
Are you still there?
Just a minute uncle, wait for me.

140
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,079
How you doing?

141
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,556
Welcome back. Did you take care
of your business?

142
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,030
Yeah. Why the long face?

143
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,193
I got news from my brother.
He's really in a squeeze.

144
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,478
Well. Prison is a tough place.

145
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,279
Emel! Who are you talking to?

146
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,710
Just friends, come on mom.

147
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,712
Okay, see you then.

148
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,076
Get in! What friends at this
hour? Come help me.

149
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,868
You are a slut.
There is whore in you.

150
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,315
The place is coming down again.
The witch's lost it.

151
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,636
This guy is waiting for you.

152
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,791
-Who's this?
-Just a poor old soul.

153
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,189
Where are you taking him?

154
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,397
To my hotel. He has nowhere to stay.
Wait for me.

155
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,159
-Who did he say he was?
-His grandpa.

156
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,275
-No? He's still alive?
-Lay off Avarel, you're a moron.

157
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,434
Cheapest hotel in Tarlabas i.
Girl Naci will do us a favour.

158
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,039
Naci, you got a room?

159
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,958
What do you want it for?

160
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,832
I'm going to stick it up
you know where.

161
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,871
I'll headbutt your face in,
then you'll see.

162
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,713
-Say it girl, got a room?
-Yes Master Cumali, at your service.

163
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,031
Give a room for uncle here.

164
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,959
Who's this guy anyway?
How do I know he'll pay?

165
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,077
Actor Kemal still owes me
a month's rent.

166
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,759
You're having your period or
something?

167
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,475
Give him the room,
don't drive me crazy.

168
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,073
-ID?
-What?

169
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,913
Hakan... What's up kid?

170
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,352
Come here, I'll kill you. I told
him I'm not buying the mintendo thing.

171
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,273
Bastard spat at me.
Comehere!

172
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,988
Come on uncle Kemal have some water
or something.

173
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,355
I'll be alright now.

174
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,910
Alright? You're getting worse every
day.

175
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,758
You've got to see a doctor.

176
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,871
You haven't been around lately.

177
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,673
I took care of some business.

178
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,519
That's my boy.

179
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,831
It is worst when it starts
during shooting.

180
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,636
The other day-what am I saying-six
months ago, I was playing a small part.

181
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,593
I began coughing, it wouldn't
go away.

182
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,110
Finally, they kicked me out.
Didn't pay me, either.

183
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,837
I hate the communists but in those
days these things were better in Russia.

184
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,197
If you fell ill, they
took you straight to hospital.

185
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,830
This would never have happened.
Especially to an artist like you.

186
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,959
Still, those reds. They ruined
my country.

187
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,357
Don't start again Andrei Mishkin.
All that's over now.

188
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,233
You know, you got me out of a
difficult situation there.

189
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,596
Not at all.

190
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,431
Your binoculars puzzled the cops.
I said I was peeping around.

191
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,118
Why do you
carry them around anyway?

192
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,278
Well. It is a keepsake.
You live in this hotel?

193
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,390
Yeah.

194
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,393
Why? Don't you have a family?
A home?

195
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:04,917
No. It's better this way.
Why are you in Istanbul uncle?

196
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,518
I am looking for somebody.

197
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,954
Where is that somebody?

198
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,872
I don't know...

199
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,713
What do you mean
''I don't know''?

200
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,150
I don't know where he is.

201
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,510
How are you going to find him
in this huge city?

202
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,671
I will.

203
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,912
Uncle, ten million people
live in this city.

204
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,470
I will look at all ten million
faces if I have to.

205
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,793
When did you last see
this somebody?

206
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,159
Thirty, thirty five years ago.

207
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,473
And you're going to look for
someone you haven't seen for...

208
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,875
...thirty five years
in a city like Istanbul?

209
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,715
You're out of your mind!

210
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,028
Is she looking?

211
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,794
She is. You got her Cimbom.

212
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,235
What is this? You get mushy the
moment you see the girls.

213
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,993
Are we going out tonight?

214
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,708
We got to do some work first.
We're all broke.

215
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,473
Look at the legs on that Fatma.

216
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,439
I'm not going to spend the rest of
my life stealing car stereos.

217
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,389
Wish we could break into Demircan's
lot. He is close to Mafia.

218
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,317
I risked my life for Demircan's job
while you were sitting...

219
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,678
...on your
backs, you faggots.

220
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,878
Cumali, watch your language man.

221
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,553
Fuck off smart ass! So what?

222
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,552
I'm crazy for this Fatma.

223
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,956
What are you staring at you bums?

224
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,476
She's taking you for a ride, idiot.

225
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,118
What? Stupid!

226
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,830
Isn't this him?

227
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,429
What's up?

228
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,153
Well. You know... Nothing.

229
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,708
You're going to look for
your man?

230
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,549
For God's sake, you'll get lost
uncle!

231
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,797
Really? We'll see.

232
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:20,029
In Istanbul? I don't believe it.
Idiot! Go get lost.

233
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,192
I'll come along with you today. Just
in case. This city could swallow a man.

234
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,951
God bless you. So many people,
so crowded.

235
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,036
Just like the ward
I was in.

236
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,794
Now. Who are we looking for?

237
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,269
Keje.

238
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,194
And where are we headed if we
don't know where she is?

239
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,868
I don't know.

240
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,235
So, Why do we go this way
and not that way?

241
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,792
I don't know. Don't keep asking
questions. I'm only trying to hear...

242
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,358
...the sound of this place.
Don't distract me. Just walk.

243
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,791
We're crazy to be walking
like this. Someone called Keje.

244
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,398
Address: Istanbul.
My feet hurt. This can't go on.

245
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,192
You go back if you want.

246
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,510
What if you get lost?

247
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,998
Displaying your wares again, eh?

248
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,676
You go to the hotel.
I'll be along.

249
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,069
Who's that?

250
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,318
He's the guy who helped me.
Got me walking all day.

251
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,355
Come inside. I'll ask you something.

252
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,352
-What happened to the thing?
-What thing baby?

253
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,153
You were going to take me to see
my brother in prison.

254
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,835
-Anything for you.
-Tomorrow's the open visit.

255
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,632
-Okay, we'll go.
-Mom will kill me if she finds out.

256
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,031
Don't let mom find out about the
prison. She hates my brother.

257
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,309
Come on. Give us a hug.

258
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,959
My dear Kemal Bey.
It's been three months.

259
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,713
I can only bow in humiliation
Naci Bey brother.

260
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,034
I can't wait till you get a part.
This is your last week.

261
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,869
Besides, this coughing of yours.
It's just too much.

262
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,792
I know. Even the syrups don't
soothe it anymore.

263
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,594
All the guests are complaining.
The whole building is shaking.

264
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,119
Any messages for me?

265
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,238
Sure, the mayor called.
He is upset you haven't called.

266
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,590
Fuck off! I'm going out.

267
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,953
The police!
If they ask I'm not here.

268
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,356
If the police find this on me,
I'm fucked. They're already after me.

269
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,716
Why are you armed?
Do you have enemies?

270
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,117
In Istanbul, everyone is your
enemy.

271
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,000
You never know what will
happen next.

272
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:00,873
See how it shines. Fourteen bullets
at a time. We stole it.

273
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,595
Common property of the gang.

274
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,596
What is this place?

275
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,279
Istanbul.

276
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,959
Istanbul!

277
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,798
Where else?

278
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:22,514
Istanbul! It looks like where I
live. There are plains...

279
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:29,473
mountains and towns.
As if I'm on top of Cudi.

280
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,759
How are you?

281
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,437
Fine. I miss you badly though.

282
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,078
Me too, sweetheart.
How's Mom?

283
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,038
God damn her.

284
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,356
Shut up! Cut it out!

285
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,432
Is this him?

286
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,511
Cumali. My brother.

287
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,319
Hello Cumali brother.

288
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,438
Hello brother Sedat. May God
spare you. How are you?

289
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,113
Not too well.

290
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,998
Something wrong?

291
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,873
Yes. Got mixed up in something
here. The top guys passed my...

292
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,509
sentence. They'll stab me.

293
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,994
Sedat!

294
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,872
Shut up! I've got to escape chief.
If I make it to the medical centre,

295
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,435
then I'll escape from the hospital.

296
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,636
But you need to bribe people to get
to the medical centre.

297
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,835
How much?

298
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,639
Two hundred million.

299
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,359
Wow!

300
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,632
Anyway, forget it now.
You're okay?

301
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,952
I'm not.

302
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,951
You take care of this girl chief.
She is your responsibility.

303
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,394
If anything happens to her I will
get out of my grave, and find you.

304
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,549
They will kill him.
How can he get this kind of money?

305
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,273
The money will be found.

306
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,789
Who will find it?
Two hundred million isn't nothing.

307
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,594
I will find it.

308
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,348
No. How can you shoulder such a
burden?

309
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,716
Your brother is
my brother.

310
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,793
Cumali! My hero.

311
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,439
What are you doing here?

312
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,159
Looking around.

313
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,549
What is that in your hand?

314
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,069
Binoculars.

315
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,033
You've no shame? Peeping on
people's wives and daughters.

316
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,198
No, I wouldn't...
I am looking for someone.

317
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,273
With binoculars?

318
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,836
Aye, How else could I see him?

319
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,668
Go away, man.

320
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,232
I have to find two hundred million.

321
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,238
You're kidding?

322
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,676
-Where the hell is he?
-This is for you, from Sekine.

323
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,076
-Where is mine, baby?
-Idiot!

324
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:15,313
Go inside.
And you go home too.

325
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,519
He must have lost his way.

326
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,829
Who?

327
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,196
That guy, the one in the hotel.

328
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,431
Why do you hang around
with that peasant?

329
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,075
Watch your language! He is
old enough to be your father.

330
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,874
This is how I talk to my father.

331
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,678
Hey! Hakan. Where's your mom?

332
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,512
She's out working.

333
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,557
So she went out early today. Naci, girl,
are you sure you didn't see uncle?

334
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,032
I told you I didn't.
You sure get obsessed about things.

335
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,155
The guy's got lost.
I shouldn't have let him go alone.

336
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,118
Where have you been, uncle?
We were all worried about you.

337
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,954
-We thought you were lost.
-I was lost, brother.

338
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,156
Great! So how did you
find your way back?..

339
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,189
The old way. I trailed my way back.
This city is a prison Cumali.

340
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,793
I can't breathe in this city.

341
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,629
It stinks like rotten carcass.
The wards used to smell like this.

342
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,633
Here, I brought you candies.

343
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,628
What's that?

344
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,915
Binoculars.

345
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,992
-Can I have a look?
-Sure.

346
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,831
Who uses this?

347
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,590
The gendarme, army officers,
and once... The bandits.

348
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,038
What is a bandit?

349
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,709
A brigand, a robber.
Living on mountains.

350
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,878
Just a human being like you
and me.

351
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,951
You know any bandits?

352
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,668
I know one. He was called Baran.
The clan chief sent Baran's father...

353
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,873
...to the mined border and had
him killed.

354
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,233
And Baran rebelled and took to the
mountains.

355
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,714
Baran is very young then. He is in
love with a girl. And a terrific shot.

356
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,032
It was a mighty mountain like
that one.

357
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,714
He fought the clan chief's
bandits at that time.

358
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,478
He picked them out with these binoculars
and gave them the bullet.

359
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,035
Are you that Baran?

360
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,909
Yes. I am.

361
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,152
Hakan. To your room, quick!
It is bed time.

362
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,549
Come on, Cumali.

363
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,555
Shut up. Give me the binoculars
Off you go.

364
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,635
Are you a bandit?

365
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,270
It was thirty five years ago.

366
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,034
Wow! Our uncle, a bandit!

367
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,350
So, what have you done
all these thirty five years?

368
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,994
I was in jail.

369
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,709
What? For thirty five years?

370
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,552
Thirty five years.

371
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,469
That's enough to kill a man.

372
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,197
It did kill all my friends.
Look, here.

373
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,075
How come you weren't pardoned?

374
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,429
I killed three more in prison.

375
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,358
What?

376
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,709
They sent hired men on me.
I finished them off.

377
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,311
You were talking about a
sweetheart. Is that Keje?

378
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,353
Aye.

379
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,916
You're looking for her?

380
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,158
Keje and the man who abducted Keje.

381
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,438
The first film about the Southeastern
problem will soon be released.

382
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:42,551
The film is expected to boldly take up
the greatest problem of this country.

383
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,389
In other news. The attempt on
business tycoon Mahmut Saho%lu's

384
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,234
life is under investigation.
The police have not yet made a

385
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,519
public statement. In the meantime,
Saho%lu remains silent.

386
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,593
The elusive Saho%lu is the owner of
an empire that has extraordinarily

387
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,838
grown to the size of thirty
companies in the last twenty years

388
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,119
and has reached everywhere like the
tentacles of an octopus.

389
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:13,317
He recently gave his only TV
interview to date to Mithat Bereket.

390
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,872
Mahmut Bey, you have become the
centre of attention with your

391
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,312
outbursts against the Industrialists'
Association and the government.

392
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,470
Yes!

393
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,836
In fact, there are various
unpleasant allegations about your

394
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,668
own wealth. You accuse the
Association of illegal practices,

395
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,192
but you cannot explain how you grew
so powerful in a matter of twenty years?

396
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,034
You are also accused of loansharking
and of seizing businesses with

397
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,476
Mafia assistance.Your textile factory
is shown as an example.

398
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,439
There are also allegations
that granting of your bankers'

399
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,149
licence is somewhat questionable.
-Who sent you here?

400
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,390
Excuse me?

401
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,078
You! Who pays you? How dare you
present rumours as the truth?

402
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,396
Please watch your tone. You can't
talk to me like that.

403
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,714
Go send me your boss...
You won't pull me down, ever!

404
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,798
-I am a journalist.
-You are a hired pen!

405
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,076
No, I am an independent journalist.

406
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,478
I employ a hundred people like
you. Go tell those who mess with me

407
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,236
they can't tear me down. They
don't have what it takes.

408
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,110
Get out of my house! Get out!
Turn the damn thing off. Cut!

409
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,072
I found you.

410
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,511
What does it say?
Come on, tell us.

411
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,948
I'm not saying!

412
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,998
Say it and I'll treat you to a
whore.

413
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,792
Fuck off then, don't!

414
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,150
-You're going to talk, or not?
-Cumali, don't!

415
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,477
-It could go off, man.
-Speak up, what did she write?

416
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,153
Brother Cumali, come help me.

417
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,833
What is it? What happened?

418
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,993
Come to the hotel. I'll show you
someone. I saw him. On TV.

419
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,875
I'll be right back. You guys stay
put. We'll be on a job tonight.

420
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,198
Yeah, you put the kid to bed.

421
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,632
Make sure he drinks his milk.
Did you wet yourself?

422
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,229
He was here?

423
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,196
Who?

424
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,355
Berfo! In a wheelchair.
Tubes up his nose.

425
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,670
Where is he? Where has he gone?

426
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,274
Who are you talking about, man?..

427
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,192
He means Mahmut Saho%lu.

428
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,677
Mahmut Saho%lu? You know him?

429
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,315
Take me to him.

430
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,278
Why did you bring this geezer?

431
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,955
Hush! He'll hear.
He is an old bandit.

432
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,918
-What?
-A bandit!

433
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,349
Meaning what?

434
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,750
You know, a bandit. On the
mountains. A highwayman.

435
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,399
You sure he didn't make it up?

436
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,194
I saw the photo. He snuffed three
people in prison.

437
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,954
Imagine what he
must have done in the mountains.

438
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,191
Run for it!

439
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,555
Hey, Bandit, come on!

440
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,837
Will you find him for me?
Take me to him

441
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,310
Give me a break, for God's sake.

442
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:31,958
God damn it.
We're just drifting bums.

443
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,477
Every job should have some
respectability. Look at us.

444
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,757
As they say: Live fast, die young
and you'll leave a handsome corpse.

445
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,716
Let me tell you something. Only way
to play this game is to play it big

446
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,437
When my father migrated to
Istanbul, he got a job as a waiter.

447
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,278
That's where he lost the game

448
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,591
I've been a mechanic, a bouncer
at clubs, parked cars.

449
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,673
Still I am a nobody.
I went to jail for nothing.

450
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,114
We're all the same.

451
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,590
The other day, I quarreled with my
dad, He wants me to go back to my...

452
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,399
job at the factory. I said no.

453
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,871
You're a worker and look where it
got us. He went mad.

454
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,832
We should all move out like Cumali.

455
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,594
I will go to brother Demircan. I'll
say: Rescue us from this life.

456
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,074
Get us on your team.

457
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,271
We'd be like royalty round here.

458
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,278
We'll get respect, man.

459
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,955
Everyone will look up to us,
shop owners etc. The girls.

460
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,079
Maybe I shouldn't come.

461
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,955
Sure! Left to yourself, you'd
get lost again. Stick to me

462
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,355
Just a minute, uncle.

463
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,874
Beg your pardon?

464
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,316
The week is over. You owe me.

465
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,794
Put him on my bill.

466
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,832
-But, Cumali...
-Shut up or I'll clobber you.

467
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:53,472
I have friends, I have partners I am
responsible to. I have to be careful.

468
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:00,029
Now, you almost sank us on that job
the other day. Still, you didn't

469
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:06,196
talk to the police, you're okay. I
know that.

470
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,914
Our business is no kids' play,
amateurs fail.

471
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,312
So last time, you begged and prayed
and I let you have your chance.

472
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,835
What will you say for yourself
this time Cumali?

473
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,958
This time we are here to put
ourselves entirely at your command.

474
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,031
I and my friends are solid, brother
Demircan.

475
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,077
Order us to die and we will.

476
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,999
And we know our way around.

477
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,714
You can't find better men to deal
the stuff.

478
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,434
There isn't a club we don't know.

479
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,036
Give us just one chance,
then decide.

480
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,630
Okay, we'll give it a try. Not a
word to anyone about this though.

481
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,877
And stay out of the
police's way.

482
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,118
If you get caught
I don't know you.

483
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,755
And this uncle over there, is he
part of your gang?

484
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,070
No. He's a bandit.

485
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,273
A real bandit. A mountain man.
That's of course, back when.

486
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,833
No bandits left on the mountains,
uncle.

487
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,992
Now, all the bandits are
down in the city.

488
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,039
I have important news for you.

489
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,753
Come inside, mom's out.

490
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,713
Sekine, when will you put out?
Cimbom's all horny.

491
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,956
God damn you, asshole!

492
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,992
Didn't I tell you not to wear
mini-skirts?

493
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,038
Mom first, now you start.
You jealous pig!

494
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,070
What is it?

495
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,753
We have a deal with brother
Demircan.

496
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,632
We'll push some of
the stuff for him.

497
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,913
So, it means we're finding money.
Don't look at my face like an idiot.

498
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,593
I'll be able to save your
brother.

499
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,796
Thank god!
My hero!

500
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,356
Don't. Mom will be
back any minute now.

501
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,392
Come on girl, give it to me.
We'll be married anyway.

502
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,119
Not before the wedding,

503
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,794
Shit! It's mom.

504
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,997
What shall we do? Let's pretend we
are just talking.

505
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,629
No! To the window...

506
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,833
Keje...

507
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,959
Keje...

508
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,232
Keje...

509
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,189
We almost got nailed there.

510
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,350
This is not the right way to go.

511
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,999
What's wrong with way?

512
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,950
Drugs are bad news. Don't do it.
You are poisoning people.

513
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,796
I've known many dealers in prison.
They all ended up badly.

514
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:43,038
''Don't do it'', eh? What should I do
then? Is theft better?

515
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,795
Or conning people?
Which one is better?

516
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,674
None. None of that is fitting for
human beings.

517
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,632
All of that is fitting for human
beings.

518
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,758
Or they wouldn't be around.
Why did you do it then?

519
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:05,835
You know why my dad named me Cumali?
My father adored Yilmaz Güney.

520
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,199
He named me after one of Güney's
screen characters.

521
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,916
He saw ''Ince Cumali''
fifteen times.

522
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,232
In everyday life my father imitated
Yilmaz Güney.

523
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:26,076
Walked and talked like him.
Looked a bit like him too.

524
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:34,352
My stepmother betrayed
him. Can you imagine?

525
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,597
A betrayed hero!

526
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,513
He shot them both. My stepmother
was crippled and the guy died.

527
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,277
So that's what my father got for
being a good guy.

528
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,879
I mean, anything can happen in
life.

529
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,951
Besides, I don't like doing this. But
Emel needs the money for her brother.

530
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:15,269
Back in jail, we knew two Kemals,
Mustafa Kemal and Dodo Kemal.

531
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:22,350
Dodo Kemal was a very young
convict. A murderer.

532
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,473
Every morning, he used to get the
papers first. He used to go through...

533
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:30,271
the pages like crazy, looking for
news of an amnesty.

534
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:37,796
After years of this, he did receive
his pardon and was freed.

535
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,716
A week later, he had murdered
someone and was back in jail.

536
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:57,957
You remind me of him. If I had
a son, he would be your age.

537
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,593
And if my father were alive, he
would be your age, Bandit.

538
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,995
Will you take me to him, brother.

539
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,395
Who?

540
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,598
The man on the TV.
Take me to him.

541
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,398
That's all I ask of you.
This is my request.

542
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,792
Is this the place?

543
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,110
Yes. This is it.

544
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,918
Are you sure?

545
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,073
Don't drive me nuts Bandit.
You said ''take me'', and I did.

546
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,749
This guy is one of the richest guys
in Turkey.

547
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,956
What is your business
with him uncle?

548
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,988
Look, I'm leaving. Can you find
your way back to the hotel?

549
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:44,399
You saw what you wanted to see.
The car's gone too. Let's go now.

550
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,515
Who are you looking for, man. Why
should I care anyway?

551
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,149
I don't own you.
I'm leaving.

552
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,351
Hey! What's going on? Just a
minute. Where are you taking us?

553
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,872
Didn't I tell you ''Let's go''
It is my fault. I should have left.

554
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:12,477
Get lost if you want. Am I your mom
or your dad? You're a grown man.

555
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,237
Get me out of here!
Get me out!

556
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,797
I'll break down the door.
Get me out of here!

557
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,314
Stop it Bandit! Are you out of your
mind? Don't!

558
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,068
What were you doing there?..

559
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,670
Were you there to kill Mahmut Bey?

560
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,554
No. I don't have a gun.

561
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,917
Why were you watching the place?

562
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,076
You're an ex-convict.
Are you a hitman?

563
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,431
No such thing.

564
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,917
Sir, there's a call for you sir.

565
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,031
Sir, please let me explain, you see,
this poor old guy is penniless.

566
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,756
We were looking for a job for
him when we saw that mansion.

567
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:40,914
We thought they might be hiring
a gardener or something.

568
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,238
We are not terrorists or anything.
We are your decent, honest...

569
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,356
one hundred percent Turkish,
sort of people.

570
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,715
Cut it out! Get out of here,
both of you.

571
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,755
See, my spiel worked. The guys
thought we were terrorists.

572
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,630
You're not going to
that house again, understand?

573
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,629
Hello.

574
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,069
Hello brother.

575
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,795
You are coming with us.

576
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,315
Where are you going?
Who are you?

577
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,313
You are not coming. Just him.
