1
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:50,420
-What's happening?
- Nick, we've got a young punk here.

2
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:57,804
- Nice bike. Fast, huh?
- Yeah.

3
00:03:00,432 --> 00:03:04,771
- You want to bet?
- Ain't you got nothing betterto do?

4
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:09,025
I say $50 on Nick.

5
00:03:09,193 --> 00:03:15,157
- What do you say?
- Yeah, sure.

6
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:18,954
I'll take your social security.

7
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:48,722
You're a real fucking whacko,
you know that, pal?

8
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:21,719
Nicky, it's me.
The school called again.

9
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:26,225
We're three months behind.
I told them we'd send a cheque.

10
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:30,479
I'm taking the kids
to Mom's on Saturday.

11
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:34,066
Good luck today. Bye.

12
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:37,989
Nick Conklin? Barney Adell, attorney.

13
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:42,493
Do yourself a favour,
wear a jacket and tie today.

14
00:06:05,353 --> 00:06:08,147
How are you, pal?

15
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:13,196
Patrick has been
calling Sister Elizabeth names.

16
00:06:13,362 --> 00:06:18,283
- I called her an ugly goose.
- That's not so bad.

17
00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:24,458
Give this money to Mommy.
I'll see you in two days.

18
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,628
Have a good day at school.

19
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:34,009
All right, hang on tight.

20
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:27,906
I hope somebody is paying you
to wear that suit.

21
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:32,536
Come on, get on. I don't want
anybody to see you like that.

22
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:39,920
- New shoes, $85 a pop.
- I hope you're wearing socks.

23
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:44,174
Ladies of the 80's
are going for shoes.

24
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:48,554
They say it's the second place
they're looking.

25
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:54,561
I heard that an lnternal Affairs
review isn't all that bad.

26
00:07:54,728 --> 00:08:01,319
- I'll let you know when it's over.
- Show up in uniform, with your medals.

27
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:08,159
I'm serious. You've got
commendations up the yin yang.

28
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:18,506
- Vincent, let's go.
- Yeah, hold on to your dick.

29
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:24,346
- Meet me at Scalari's for lunch.
- We'll see how it goes.

30
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:28,684
If you don't show up,
you're going to be in real trouble.

31
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,062
13:00, do or die.

32
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:35,525
- You watch your tail.
- Yeah.

33
00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:50,625
You'll walk. Just tell the truth.
Run your mouth, they'll screw you.

34
00:08:50,793 --> 00:08:55,880
- I've got nothing to hide.
- I hope not, for my sake.

35
00:08:56,047 --> 00:08:59,760
- Hi Nick, good luck.
- Thanks.

36
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:03,724
- How's your lawyer?
- I hardly know him.

37
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:09,981
Ifthese people get their way,
you'll get to know him real well.

38
00:09:10,148 --> 00:09:14,485
You'll be sending his kids
through college.

39
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:33,300
- That's an impressive record.
- A regular hero.

40
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:36,720
- Tell me about Monte Ronan.
- Good cop.

41
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:42,476
He's the kind of guy you want
around when the shit goes down.

42
00:09:42,644 --> 00:09:45,772
- That's what you think.
- Yeah.

43
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:49,985
- He's dirt.
- Yeah? Have you worked the streets?

44
00:09:50,152 --> 00:09:53,614
We've got 30 homicides a week.

45
00:09:53,781 --> 00:10:01,456
- Tell us about Patrick Donleavy.
- My client knows of no malfeasance.

46
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:05,920
28 June, '88.
Your unit arrested three suspects.

47
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:09,215
Cash was logged in at $65,000
and change.

48
00:10:09,383 --> 00:10:14,429
We have reason to believe
there was over $73,000.

49
00:10:14,596 --> 00:10:18,392
- Our sources say...
- Just listen to the cops.

50
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,357
It depends on the cops. Some
heroes think the rules don't apply.

51
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:27,611
I try to do my job.
It ain't easy, but I'm clean.

52
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:32,284
You have two kids in school.
House payments.

53
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:38,249
Alimony and an apartment.
I admire your thrift.

54
00:10:38,415 --> 00:10:45,841
- Well, life's a bitch.
- You're out at least 1,000 a month.

55
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:50,013
If you want to charge me, charge me.
If not, go back to your office.

56
00:10:50,178 --> 00:10:54,350
We'll charge you.
We can always get to a dirty cop.

57
00:10:54,517 --> 00:11:00,940
You want dirt, go to City Hall.
Don't come here busting my ass!

58
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:08,783
- Suits!
- Are you okay?

59
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,669
How are the girls in Japan?

60
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:24,551
What is the most important control
exercised by a sergeant?

61
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:29,306
- A, cost control?
- B, manpower control.

62
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:35,856
What are we going for here,
sergeant or the supreme court?

63
00:11:36,023 --> 00:11:40,152
How are you doing, Joe?
Give me a Scotch.

64
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:44,533
- That bad?
- I can't take any more of this shit.

65
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,454
He's going to be drinking his lunch.

66
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:52,166
To the lnternal Affairs Division:
Fuck 'em!

67
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:01,551
You ought to think about that. It's
a fast way to get to headquarters.

68
00:12:01,718 --> 00:12:06,225
- You never know.
- That's right.

69
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,812
- Did you see Abolafia?
- I saw him.

70
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:15,276
- I hear he's importing Subarus.
- Wise guys have got to eat, too.

71
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:21,367
Lunching with the mob. Intelligence
has probably got this place wired.

72
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:26,330
Just talk into my left titty.

73
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:36,593
Look out!

74
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:39,345
What's going on?

75
00:13:35,576 --> 00:13:39,539
- Don't even think about it.
- It's done, babe.

76
00:13:48,258 --> 00:13:51,553
What did you say?

77
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,183
Sit down.
Relax.

78
00:14:37,732 --> 00:14:41,737
Just relax.
Mind your business.

79
00:14:49,203 --> 00:14:53,207
- Joe, call 911.
- Police!

80
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,113
- Hold it!
- Get out ofthe way!

81
00:15:41,846 --> 00:15:45,141
Police! Get out of here!

82
00:15:58,322 --> 00:16:01,577
Get the fuck out of here.

83
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:10,086
The guy who came through here,
where did he go?

84
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:13,341
Get out!

85
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:19,640
Out! Get out!

86
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:23,171
- Nicky, where are you?
- Here!

87
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,805
You hear me?
Are you okay?

88
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:35,769
Up. I've got him...
Up!

89
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:40,315
Okay, nice and easy.

90
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:42,902
Come on.

91
00:17:45,446 --> 00:17:48,450
You little fuck.

92
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:51,203
You little shit!

93
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,833
Take him out of here.

94
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:05,677
Are you okay?

95
00:18:13,229 --> 00:18:16,273
Japanese mob.

96
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,652
The victims are certainly yakuza.

97
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:24,616
What were the Jap mob
and the Mafia doing over lunch?

98
00:18:24,783 --> 00:18:29,538
- Nobody knows nothing?
- Nobody knows dick.

99
00:18:32,082 --> 00:18:35,463
- Is that the paper the box was in?
- Yeah.

100
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:38,882
The famous box.

101
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:43,012
I'm going downstairs
to give our little darling a talk.

102
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:59,198
He doesn't speak English and
he ain't talking too much Japanese.

103
00:18:59,365 --> 00:19:03,243
- Who's this guy?
- Japanese Embassy.

104
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:09,209
- They want him first.
- My collar, my case.

105
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:23,934
I got two clean homicides in there.
I almost bought it.

106
00:19:24,101 --> 00:19:29,606
If they want him, they can
have him... after 20 years to life.

107
00:19:34,697 --> 00:19:38,909
- What's this?
- The State Department.

108
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:44,667
They talk to me, I talk to you.
Shit rolls downhill.

109
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:49,422
You and Vincent
are talking him back.

110
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:54,093
- This is bullshit!
- Don't start up again, Nick.

111
00:19:54,260 --> 00:20:00,518
You already went off in their faces.
Take a breather, relax.

112
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:06,483
- Get a geisha. Do us both a favour.
- Give that to lnternal Affairs.

113
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:10,112
They can water my plants.

114
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:16,119
I'll stand behind you 100%...
as long as you're right.

115
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:19,581
As long as you're right.

116
00:20:58,876 --> 00:21:03,382
What is it costing the city
to send this asshole home?

117
00:21:03,547 --> 00:21:07,636
It isn't worth the cost of the dirt
to bury him.

118
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:12,475
You know Ronan, right?
He's a good cop.

119
00:21:12,642 --> 00:21:18,942
- Yeah, he's a good cop.
- He's a good cop.

120
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:26,907
He busts his ass 14 hours a day
and ends up in debt for life.

121
00:21:27,074 --> 00:21:32,248
Now look at this asshole. The man
is wearing my house payments.

122
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:36,545
What Ronan did was wrong.

123
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:42,801
He just took something
off a dealer he locked up.

124
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:50,935
You wait till you get a family.
The man was just trying to get by.

125
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:58,903
What the fuck are you looking at?

126
00:23:00,432 --> 00:23:03,977
- What happened?
- I don't know.

127
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:07,482
He bit his lip or something.
Seat belt tight, babe?

128
00:23:57,414 --> 00:24:00,125
We've got the local heat.

129
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:05,882
I think you are looking for us.
Detective Conklin from New York.

130
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:12,639
Welcome to Japan.
I am Inspector Nashida.

131
00:24:12,806 --> 00:24:16,895
This is my partner,
Detective Vincent.

132
00:24:17,063 --> 00:24:20,816
Do you have some paperwork for us?

133
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:24,987
Would you sign here
and here, please?

134
00:24:45,177 --> 00:24:48,598
Key, please.

135
00:24:48,765 --> 00:24:51,351
Thank you.

136
00:25:02,154 --> 00:25:05,575
Come on, Nicky.

137
00:25:07,285 --> 00:25:13,084
Off duty! I'll be in and out of geishas
like a Time's Square pickpocket.

138
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:19,091
Remember ladies, if you get bored,
Hotel Meiji.

139
00:25:19,258 --> 00:25:24,139
I am Inspector Yamato,
Osaka Police.

140
00:25:44,787 --> 00:25:49,793
They were dressed as offiicers.
It was in Japanese.

141
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,172
All right?

142
00:26:07,897 --> 00:26:12,819
They were wearing uniforms.
They had the paperwork.

143
00:26:12,986 --> 00:26:17,991
Definite maybes
and definite don't knows.

144
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,913
It ain't a lot of fun over here.

145
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,629
I went by the book.
There's no way to verify the ID.

146
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:32,132
- Maybe, I don't know.
- Nine definite maybes.

147
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:38,139
- Could I score some coffee?
- Coffee? One?

148
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:42,812
The paperwork is in Japanese.
I can't do a strip search.

149
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:46,274
I've been here two hours.

150
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:52,281
How much more time?

151
00:26:54,492 --> 00:26:58,747
He does that one more time,
I'll cut it off.

152
00:26:59,915 --> 00:27:03,210
Unbelievable, identical strangers.

153
00:27:03,377 --> 00:27:08,382
This is still an NYPD collar, right?

154
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:14,348
- Noodles? Don't hurt yourself.
- I'll salvage the situation.

155
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:28,989
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

156
00:27:33,662 --> 00:27:38,625
Tell the IAD suits to kiss my ass.
Enough of this bullshit.

157
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:43,714
Are we on?
Nicky, game time.

158
00:27:43,881 --> 00:27:48,262
We're on, Captain.
I'll call you later.

159
00:27:48,428 --> 00:27:55,436
- What did Oliver have to say?
- You don't want to know.

160
00:27:55,603 --> 00:27:58,648
- Are you going to be nice?
- I'll be nice.

161
00:27:58,816 --> 00:28:03,362
I just hope one ofthese Nips
speaks English.

162
00:28:04,822 --> 00:28:11,914
Assistant Inspector
Matsumoto Masahiro, Osaka Police.

163
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:15,543
And I do speak fucking English.

164
00:28:21,217 --> 00:28:24,845
Ask if there were
any witnesses at the airport.

165
00:28:32,271 --> 00:28:36,901
The superintendent says
it's possible.

166
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:42,657
Manned space flight is possible.
Am I missing something here?

167
00:28:42,824 --> 00:28:48,915
- He's tired from the flight.
- Could I get some coffee?

168
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:56,549
Tell us who this Sato guy is
and maybe we can help you.

169
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:02,221
Translate every word.
I want every word translated.

170
00:29:02,389 --> 00:29:05,683
Yes, I understand.

171
00:29:15,862 --> 00:29:22,661
Because of your negligence
a criminal has escaped.

172
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:26,124
- You should apologise.
- Our negligence?

173
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:33,549
They had your documents, your
uniforms and were in a secure area.

174
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:39,180
We'll take some ofthe heat for this
but we're not taking the rap.

175
00:29:39,347 --> 00:29:43,978
- The bite, the fall.
- The blame.

176
00:29:48,983 --> 00:29:53,405
- This is an insurance policy.
- He speaks English.

177
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,577
The police will find
your escaped prisoner.

178
00:29:58,745 --> 00:30:02,624
You are foreigners. Nothing more
than interested observers.

179
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:10,050
- Go home, detective.
- This is an international incident.

180
00:30:10,216 --> 00:30:15,639
Until you sign off on this dickhead,
his ass is mine.

181
00:30:15,806 --> 00:30:23,314
We either work together on this
together or I'm going to the Press.

182
00:30:23,481 --> 00:30:28,152
- All right, you can stay.
- Thank you.

183
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,117
- You have to leave your guns.
- We're police offiicers.

184
00:30:32,283 --> 00:30:38,039
You are civilians here. It is
illegal for you to carry a gun.

185
00:30:38,206 --> 00:30:41,877
We understand.
Nick, your gun.

186
00:30:43,171 --> 00:30:47,008
- Happy?
- All your guns.

187
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:53,558
You assign us a cop
who can find his ass with two hands.

188
00:30:53,724 --> 00:30:58,856
- What?
- He wants a tough cop.

189
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:04,946
Of course. You will have
one of our top offiicers.

190
00:31:07,948 --> 00:31:11,453
It sounds good,
or he's working on the dinner menu.

191
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:16,668
- Sayanora, Chief.
- Where's our cop?

192
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:21,173
It is my honour.

193
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:56,004
Stay close, please.

194
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:48,313
- Can we take a look at him?
- Just a moment.

195
00:32:51,776 --> 00:32:55,572
This is one ofthe phoney cops
from the airport.

196
00:32:55,738 --> 00:32:59,576
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

197
00:33:02,122 --> 00:33:08,795
He's got no defensive wounds.
A nice, clean right-handed cut.

198
00:33:08,963 --> 00:33:14,260
He's a fresh puppy.
The perpetrator could be wet.

199
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:16,930
Look at this.

200
00:33:18,849 --> 00:33:23,061
Nice, maybe he's got
two fives for a ten.

201
00:33:26,274 --> 00:33:30,446
The superintendent thanks you.
We should go.

202
00:33:30,613 --> 00:33:34,825
Wait a minute.
Tell us what's going on.

203
00:33:34,992 --> 00:33:40,248
- Is Sato doing his own guy?
- Don't interfere.

204
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:47,380
- I'm not interfering. This is what I do.
- You're just observers.

205
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:52,054
I usually get kissed
before I get fucked.

206
00:33:54,014 --> 00:33:59,062
- What did he say?
- He likes a little foreplay.

207
00:34:29,805 --> 00:34:34,018
- Detective!
- He's not going to break anything.

208
00:34:39,733 --> 00:34:45,239
A little peroxide
will get rid of the bloodstain.

209
00:34:45,406 --> 00:34:49,745
- What are you?
- Detective Conklin, NYPD.

210
00:34:49,912 --> 00:34:52,665
How did you get that blood?

211
00:34:52,832 --> 00:34:57,836
The girls think you're the guy
who lost Sato at the airport.

212
00:34:58,004 --> 00:35:02,134
Just offthe plane
and you make the evening news.

213
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:05,971
Americans who are less than perfect
are amusing.

214
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:09,058
Can I talk to you?

215
00:35:11,644 --> 00:35:14,522
How did you get the blood?

216
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:21,322
The girl who found the body was
upset, so I put my arms around her.

217
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:25,619
- Are you from Boston?
- Chicago.

218
00:35:25,787 --> 00:35:29,916
- Where did you learn Japanese?
- Chicago.

219
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:33,127
Did you know the victim?

220
00:35:34,504 --> 00:35:37,591
He was just in here drinking.

221
00:35:37,759 --> 00:35:41,887
- Did you see the killer leave?
- Yeah, sure.

222
00:35:42,054 --> 00:35:46,936
And he wrote his name on the back
of my dress and said to give it to you.

223
00:35:47,102 --> 00:35:50,648
- Anything else?
- What are you busting my ass for?

224
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:55,861
Because you could get me killed.
There's a war going on here.

225
00:35:56,028 --> 00:36:01,244
- What are you talking about?
- Between Sato and his old boss Sugai.

226
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:05,957
- Who knows about this?
- Counting you and me?

227
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:09,086
1 1 million.

228
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:19,848
- Did that woman tell you anything?
- Why would she? I'm just an observer.

229
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:25,563
Tell Ohashi I'll report to him
when he's ready to report to me.

230
00:36:27,481 --> 00:36:32,154
- I'm a detective just like you.
- Bullshit, you're a suit.

231
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,326
Tell Ohashi
one good hand-job deserves another.

232
00:36:39,662 --> 00:36:44,750
Charlie, get your map out.
Find the directions to the hotel.

233
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:47,713
- Don't you want a ride?
- We'll walk.

234
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:54,679
I want a complete file on Sato,
and a report on what happened here.

235
00:36:54,846 --> 00:37:00,227
- Translate it by 09:00 tomorrow.
- Very well.

236
00:37:00,394 --> 00:37:03,022
Thank you.

237
00:37:03,189 --> 00:37:07,109
- Come on, Charlie.
- You will have a long walk.

238
00:37:07,277 --> 00:37:12,783
If I get lost, we'll call a cop.

239
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,745
What?

240
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:30,637
I know he didn't fill us in
on the gang war, but I like the guy.

241
00:37:30,804 --> 00:37:33,891
You told me it was four more blocks.

242
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:41,273
- You said we'd walk home.
- I don't know where the hotel is.

243
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:47,198
This isn't the time to ask you
what's going down with Oliver...

244
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:52,245
Some suits back home
think I cut a deal with Sato.

245
00:37:52,411 --> 00:37:57,460
They're full of shit.
I'll back you up.

246
00:37:57,627 --> 00:38:01,172
What's going on here?

247
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:36,797
What? What?
What is your problem?

248
00:38:52,856 --> 00:38:57,862
I don't know. We should cut our losses
and let the locals handle this one.

249
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,491
I can't go back without him.

250
00:39:07,874 --> 00:39:13,463
Sato Kojo. He started as an enforcer
and rose quickly to minor boss.

251
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,928
He controls some of the docks
and some construction in Hawaii.

252
00:39:21,013 --> 00:39:25,185
The victim last night
was one of Sato's guys.

253
00:39:25,352 --> 00:39:30,983
And six hours earlier,
Sato put a hit on this guy...

254
00:39:33,195 --> 00:39:38,116
- Okada Genkuro, an artist.
- He's an engraver.

255
00:39:38,283 --> 00:39:45,667
- 48 hours later he's in Scalari's.
- Who's this with Sato?

256
00:39:47,211 --> 00:39:50,380
Sugai Kunio. Top Oyabun.

257
00:39:50,547 --> 00:39:56,471
Like your Mafia bosses...
construction, gambling, extortion.

258
00:39:56,638 --> 00:40:00,977
- What's Sugai doing with Sato?
- I don't know.

259
00:40:01,143 --> 00:40:05,816
Even I know that Sato
used to work for Sugai.

260
00:40:05,982 --> 00:40:10,320
Now they're knocking each other off
left and right.

261
00:40:10,487 --> 00:40:13,991
These goddamn suits!

262
00:40:17,203 --> 00:40:20,623
- What's with the SWATs out here?
- Exercise.

263
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:26,255
- Training perhaps.
- Come on, start cutting us in.

264
00:40:26,421 --> 00:40:32,137
I can't figure out what was in
that box in Scalari's. Drugs?

265
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:38,602
No drugs. Steel, liquor, horses.

266
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:42,733
He owns part ofthe Club Miyako.

267
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:51,910
What's going on outside?

268
00:40:52,076 --> 00:40:56,373
They have a tip
about Sato's last hideout.

269
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,543
- It's only a tip.
- It's only a tip?

270
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:03,339
I promise I'll keep you informed.

271
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:12,058
Could you find the file
on Sato's guy... Shinji Sekimitsu?

272
00:41:19,733 --> 00:41:23,237
Please, I need authorisation.

273
00:41:23,403 --> 00:41:27,743
No, it's a training exercise.

274
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:15,088
- Observers.
- You got it.

275
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:39,909
Observers.

276
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,801
Is that the guy from the airport?

277
00:43:03,477 --> 00:43:05,395
That's him, right?

278
00:43:14,532 --> 00:43:17,159
Easy, Nicky.

279
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:25,835
Hi, sweetheart.

280
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:33,094
You remember me, don't you?
Where's your boss?

281
00:43:43,857 --> 00:43:48,654
- I only want to talk to him.
- What are you doing?

282
00:43:48,821 --> 00:43:52,701
This isn't New York.
We've got rules here.

283
00:43:52,867 --> 00:43:57,539
I've seen Sato's work.
He ain't following your programme.

284
00:43:57,705 --> 00:44:01,168
- You must have patience.
- Fuck patience.

285
00:44:15,226 --> 00:44:19,396
He was here. I know it.

286
00:44:29,618 --> 00:44:34,706
- We have to go.
- We're just observing.

287
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:37,919
Can I take a quick look?

288
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:38,989
Charlie.

289
00:45:46,122 --> 00:45:51,627
- I got something.
- Mas is in deep shit now.

290
00:46:12,652 --> 00:46:16,655
You don't want to eat that shit.
Give me a stick.

291
00:46:19,451 --> 00:46:24,624
- Son of a bitch!
- I always said you were the best.

292
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:28,128
I owe you lunch.

293
00:46:59,872 --> 00:47:02,708
Where's Mas?

294
00:47:04,378 --> 00:47:08,466
Mas, we got good news for you.

295
00:47:08,633 --> 00:47:12,345
What the fuck's his problem?

296
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:25,485
I will have no more to do with you.
Please, get out.

297
00:47:26,778 --> 00:47:32,118
- I know you took a little heat...
- Ohashi is waiting for you.

298
00:47:32,285 --> 00:47:36,540
- We'll square it.
- Let us explain what happened.

299
00:47:36,707 --> 00:47:43,172
You have dishonoured me
and our department. You are a thief.

300
00:47:48,052 --> 00:47:51,265
I saw you take the money.

301
00:47:54,143 --> 00:47:59,816
You saw me take the money...
I wanted to get things done.

302
00:47:59,983 --> 00:48:04,696
I have informed Ohashi.
He informed your captain.

303
00:48:04,864 --> 00:48:11,162
- We know what kind of man you are.
- You don't know one thing about me.

304
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:15,542
You and your self-righteous bullshit
will cost me my job.

305
00:48:24,678 --> 00:48:27,431
If you pull it, you'd better use it.

306
00:48:31,353 --> 00:48:36,107
Watch this, okay?
I only want to do this once.

307
00:48:40,196 --> 00:48:44,618
Look, see how the impression
hardly leaves the ashes?

308
00:48:44,785 --> 00:48:47,913
There wasn't enough pressure.

309
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,500
This is good, but this ain't money.

310
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:57,883
The box contained samples or plates,
and this is a counterfeiting war.

311
00:48:58,049 --> 00:49:04,181
And you should talk to your partner
before you go to the suits.

312
00:49:05,224 --> 00:49:07,102
We were going to cut you in.

313
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:44,936
Don't ever say you didn't have
a good time with Charlie Vincent.

314
00:49:50,901 --> 00:49:56,116
You know the American girl,
is she around tonight?

315
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:02,290
Come here, baby. Join us.

316
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:05,377
Come on.

317
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:12,509
What is this?
It's still moving in my mouth.

318
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:19,184
I haven't taken the silverware,
so just take a hike.

319
00:50:19,351 --> 00:50:23,940
Nicky, what are you doing?
Sit down. Join us.

320
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:29,655
Superintendent Ohashi would
like to see you in the morning.

321
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:38,581
Smoke a little peace pipe here.
We're all partners now.

322
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:43,629
Mas, please join us.
We'll have a good time.

323
00:50:43,796 --> 00:50:47,716
- Come on.
- Thank you.

324
00:50:57,603 --> 00:51:03,318
Conklin, I did my duty.
These are the men I work for.

325
00:51:03,485 --> 00:51:07,740
You talk to your partners
before you go to the suits.

326
00:51:07,907 --> 00:51:12,912
You should think less of yourself
and more of your group.

327
00:51:13,078 --> 00:51:16,625
Try to work like a Japanese.

328
00:51:16,792 --> 00:51:21,005
I grew up with your soldiers.
You were wise then.

329
00:51:21,171 --> 00:51:25,968
Now, music and movies
are all that America is good for.

330
00:51:26,136 --> 00:51:31,058
We make the machines. We build
the future. We won the peace.

331
00:51:31,225 --> 00:51:37,523
Not one of you guys
has ever had an original idea.

332
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:42,613
Are you guys
going to argue all the time?

333
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:49,579
What is this, a conspiracy
to fuck up my evening?

334
00:51:49,746 --> 00:51:53,709
Mas, what are you doing?
It's good-time time.

335
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:57,963
- Kampaitime.
- Up and down.

336
00:52:19,697 --> 00:52:22,617
Can I talk to you?

337
00:52:22,784 --> 00:52:27,999
Look, I need your help.
I've got my tits in the wringer.

338
00:52:28,166 --> 00:52:32,045
Just talk to me
for a couple of minutes.

339
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:38,344
Give that woman down there $50
and go where she takes you.

340
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:57,991
Show a little mercy,
some people are trying to eat.

341
00:52:58,157 --> 00:53:02,289
- You like that stuff?
- Yes.

342
00:53:02,455 --> 00:53:06,751
"That's Amore".
I was a teenager when it was new.

343
00:53:06,918 --> 00:53:11,047
I was a teenager when it was old.

344
00:53:11,214 --> 00:53:16,179
If you're going to hang around with
NYPD, here's what you have to do.

345
00:53:16,345 --> 00:53:21,434
Lose that tie, it's a fire hazard.
Here's a little gift.

346
00:53:21,602 --> 00:53:26,733
Straight from the Big Apple,
from Charlie Vincent to you.

347
00:53:29,777 --> 00:53:32,989
- Thanks.
- It's my honour.

348
00:53:34,115 --> 00:53:36,785
I like you.

349
00:53:36,952 --> 00:53:40,873
- Top drawer, yes?
- Top drawer.

350
00:53:42,292 --> 00:53:46,796
Hey, meatball, what are you doing?
You can't hit a note.

351
00:53:49,467 --> 00:53:52,971
- You could do better?
- Yes, I could do better.

352
00:53:53,138 --> 00:53:57,475
- Put it up or shut it up.
- To you, from me.

353
00:54:04,692 --> 00:54:07,821
- Thank you.
- Don't quit your day job.

354
00:54:16,206 --> 00:54:20,418
That quick?
What's he talking about?

355
00:54:44,989 --> 00:54:47,534
Ray Charles.

356
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,620
You and me.

357
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:55,417
Detective, wait.

358
00:54:55,583 --> 00:55:00,131
Masahiro Matsumoto,
ladies and gentlemen.

359
00:55:26,328 --> 00:55:28,663
Masahiro Matsumoto!

360
00:55:31,959 --> 00:55:34,963
If you're looking for Sato,
I can't help you.

361
00:55:35,129 --> 00:55:38,008
He hasn't been here in over a year.

362
00:55:38,175 --> 00:55:42,763
- Who did he do regularly?
- Do you think I pay attention?

363
00:55:42,929 --> 00:55:48,144
You'd recognise if one of your
customers had a different tie on.

364
00:55:51,898 --> 00:55:57,697
He had a different girl every time.
I didn't know of anybody regular.

365
00:55:57,864 --> 00:56:03,287
That's Sugai and the girl in sequins
is the one with blood on her hands.

366
00:56:03,453 --> 00:56:07,833
- You did your homework.
- How do I get to him?

367
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,006
I've been living in this country
for seven years...

368
00:56:13,173 --> 00:56:17,260
I still can't read the headlines.

369
00:56:17,427 --> 00:56:20,139
How do I get to him?

370
00:56:20,306 --> 00:56:25,103
Let the police handle it.
No one's going to help a gaijin.

371
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:31,360
A stranger. A foreigner.
Me and you... more you.

372
00:56:39,786 --> 00:56:42,580
- Got to go.
- Hold on.

373
00:56:42,747 --> 00:56:47,296
- Wrigley Field has lights now.
- Yeah, Mom told me.

374
00:56:47,463 --> 00:56:53,052
Did she? Did she say it's not stupid
to be scared?

375
00:56:53,219 --> 00:56:56,347
But sometimes
you've got to choose a side.

376
00:56:56,514 --> 00:57:01,269
I did. I'm on my side.

377
00:57:31,972 --> 00:57:36,018
- The drinks cost $1 25.
- How much was the fish?

378
00:57:36,185 --> 00:57:40,314
- $200.
- Holy shit!

379
00:57:40,481 --> 00:57:44,653
How much would it have been
if it was cooked? Did you pay?

380
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:51,369
No, Matsumoto signed it over
to the Osaka Police Department.

381
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:55,749
That's the best thing
he's done for us. You like the guy?

382
00:57:55,917 --> 00:58:00,546
- Mas? He's okay.
- Who the hell's this?

383
00:58:07,596 --> 00:58:10,975
I can't figure this place out.

384
00:58:13,227 --> 00:58:16,730
You want to play?
You and me, come on.

385
00:58:16,897 --> 00:58:19,193
Right here.

386
00:58:20,402 --> 00:58:23,155
That's it. Hey!

387
00:58:23,322 --> 00:58:26,742
- Fuck!
- Good move.

388
00:58:30,747 --> 00:58:35,628
Good. Bring it back.
We'll go again.

389
00:58:35,795 --> 00:58:39,965
Bring it back... Did you see that?

390
00:58:40,133 --> 00:58:45,180
- Don't get personal.
- Fuck you!

391
00:58:45,347 --> 00:58:51,061
- Charlie, it's only a coat.
- He's got my passport.

392
00:58:51,229 --> 00:58:58,112
- Jesus Christ.
- Come here, you little fuck.

393
00:59:00,072 --> 00:59:03,410
Charlie!

394
00:59:34,391 --> 00:59:37,811
Charlie!

395
00:59:38,979 --> 00:59:43,194
Come here!
Fuck!

396
00:59:50,993 --> 00:59:54,957
You little shit.

397
00:59:55,123 --> 00:59:59,336
Stay there, you little shit.

398
00:59:59,503 --> 01:00:04,967
You little shit!

399
01:00:05,135 --> 01:00:07,221
All right...

400
01:00:11,433 --> 01:00:14,604
Come on, let's go.

401
01:00:41,427 --> 01:00:45,724
Come on, who's first?

402
01:00:47,726 --> 01:00:51,187
Get out of there, Charlie.

403
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:01,323
Get out of there.

404
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,210
Jesus Christ!

405
01:01:15,299 --> 01:01:18,260
You fuck!

406
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,153
Get out of there!
