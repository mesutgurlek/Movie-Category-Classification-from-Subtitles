1
00:00:01,447 --> 00:00:03,517  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:471 Y2:496
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:03,607 --> 00:00:04,596  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:471 Y2:491
I didn"t kill him.

3
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:06,882  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:439 Y2:496
- The evidence says you did.
- I was set up.

4
00:00:08,847 --> 00:00:10,519  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:471 Y2:496
Put down your weapon.

5
00:00:10,607 --> 00:00:13,246  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:439 Y2:496
I find it incumbent
you see the inside of a cell.

6
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:16,956  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:439 Y2:491
- L"m looking for Burrows.
- Man killed the VP"s brother.

7
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:19,481  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Why do you want to see him?
- He"s my brother.

8
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:21,637  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:439 Y2:496
- L"m getting you out.
- Impossible.

9
00:00:21,727 --> 00:00:23,240  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:471 Y2:496
Not if you designed the place.

10
00:00:23,807 --> 00:00:26,037  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:439 Y2:491
- You"ve seen the blueprints.
- Better.

11
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:27,924  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:471 Y2:496
L"ve got"em on me.

12
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:30,680  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:439 Y2:496
- You find out who"s trying to bury him.
- Nobody is.

13
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:31,961  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:471 Y2:491
The evidence was cooked.

14
00:00:32,047 --> 00:00:36,802  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:439 Y2:496
- There"s a lawyer poking around.
- Anyone that"s a threat is expendable.

15
00:00:37,607 --> 00:00:42,237  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:439 Y2:496
- L"m gonna kill that scum.
- You kill him, you kill our ticket out of here.

16
00:00:42,327 --> 00:00:44,602  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:439 Y2:491
- Where"s Maricruz?
- She"s with me now.

17
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:46,678  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:471 Y2:496
Fish, I gotta be back in.

18
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:52,125  X1:082 X2:638 Y1:439 Y2:496
Nick, Project Justice. My boss may not think
Lincoln"s case is worth looking into, but I do.

19
00:00:52,207 --> 00:00:53,560  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:471 Y2:496
When do we get started?

20
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:55,603  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:471 Y2:496
This wall is just the beginning.

21
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:58,963  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:439 Y2:491
There"s a lot of real estate
in between here and the outside.

22
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:04,485  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:439 Y2:496
That is a transfer request. Michael Scofield
is getting shipped out tomorrow.

23
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:40,246  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:439 Y2:496
- About your transfer request for Scofield.
- More specifically, why you denied it.

24
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:44,923  X1:081 X2:638 Y1:439 Y2:496
Look, Mr Kellerman, do I come to your house
and tell you where to put your furniture?

25
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:50,081  X1:083 X2:636 Y1:439 Y2:496
- We"re just asking for professional courtesy.
- A federal courtesy in a state penitentiary.

26
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:53,443  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:439 Y2:496
Most people would be happy
to have a body taken off their hands.

27
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:56,883  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:439 Y2:496
These men are my responsibility.
From the minute they walk in

28
00:01:56,967 --> 00:02:00,562  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:439 Y2:496
to the time they"ve paid their debt to society,
l"m responsible.

29
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:03,320  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:439 Y2:495
Unless he"s done something
I don"t know about,

30
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:06,922  X1:151 X2:570 Y1:439 Y2:496
he is gonna stay here at Fox River
under my watch.

31
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:10,795  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:439 Y2:496
Mr Pope, in our line of work,
just about everyone has done something

32
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:13,959  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:471 Y2:491
that someone doesn"t know about.

33
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:17,880  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:439 Y2:496
- What"s this?
- Right now, just a piece of history.

34
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:21,880  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:439 Y2:496
Whether it becomes a current event,
now, that"s up to you.

35
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:28,925  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:471 Y2:496
My wife already knows about Toledo.

36
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:31,316  X1:258 X2:462 Y1:471 Y2:496
Does she really?

37
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:39,001  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:471 Y2:495
You"re a smart man, Warden.

38
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:43,000  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:439 Y2:496
L"m sure you can find a reason
Scofield"s presence is no longer required

39
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:45,760  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:471 Y2:496
at this particular correctional facility.

40
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,920  X1:149 X2:571 Y1:471 Y2:495
I need some more PVC here, boss.

41
00:03:12,727 --> 00:03:14,843  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Boss?
- Sure thing, Burrows.

42
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:18,522  X1:156 X2:564 Y1:439 Y2:496
I don"t wanna check for splinters.
I want every piece accounted for.

43
00:03:18,607 --> 00:03:20,723  X1:328 X2:391 Y1:471 Y2:491
Sure.

44
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:23,640  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:471 Y2:496
I got a ripped fertilizer bag inside.

45
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:27,519  X1:302 X2:416 Y1:471 Y2:496
Hey, you!

46
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,723  X1:331 X2:387 Y1:471 Y2:491
You!

47
00:03:29,807 --> 00:03:35,518  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:439 Y2:496
Get in there and clean it up before this whole
place starts smelling like San Juan.

48
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:43,244  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:439 Y2:491
OK, he"s on his way. Do you mind telling me
what this is all about?

49
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:48,165  X1:092 X2:627 Y1:471 Y2:496
These are the guys we"re breaking out with.

50
00:03:48,247 --> 00:03:52,081  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:439 Y2:496
I don"t think so, fish.
That was not our agreement.

51
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:55,885  X1:107 X2:612 Y1:471 Y2:496
L"m not gonna work with this crazy rhino.

52
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:59,437  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Keep pushing it, John.
- Yeah, I keep pushing it, you know. Huh?

53
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:01,563  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:471 Y2:496
What"s your deal, man?

54
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:04,798  X1:099 X2:620 Y1:471 Y2:496
Touch my brother again and l"ll show you.

55
00:04:07,927 --> 00:04:10,566  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:471 Y2:491
Brother? Your brother?

56
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:20,165  X1:074 X2:642 Y1:439 Y2:496
We"ve got a few minutes. Are we gonna spend
"em spitting on each other or talk business?

57
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:23,398  X1:168 X2:552 Y1:439 Y2:491
The reason we"re all here today
is we have a decision to make.

58
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:25,762  X1:221 X2:499 Y1:471 Y2:496
English, Fitz, or Percy.

59
00:04:25,847 --> 00:04:31,046  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:439 Y2:491
If we"re gonna pull this off,
we need to take one of them out.

60
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:33,641  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:471 Y2:496
And you want us to tell you which one?

61
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:36,844  X1:123 X2:597 Y1:439 Y2:491
I just want you to help me get to them.
L"ll take it from there.

62
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:39,157  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:439 Y2:491
- You"re crazy.
- All I need is five minutes.

63
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:43,001  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:439 Y2:496
- You won"t get five seconds.
- I thought you had everything worked out.

64
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:47,763  X1:074 X2:644 Y1:439 Y2:496
We"re not breaking out of a Jamba Juice.
It"s gonna take more than digging a few holes.

65
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:51,840  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:439 Y2:491
There are eyes, ears, dots that couldn"t be
connected from the outside.

66
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:56,045  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:439 Y2:491
- And English, Fitz or Percy?
- One of those dots.

67
00:04:57,767 --> 00:05:01,806  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:439 Y2:496
And how exactly
are you supposed to pull this off?

68
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:04,959  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:471 Y2:496
With a little help from my friends.

69
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:24,596  X1:075 X2:643 Y1:471 Y2:496
Sucre, hold up. Scofield, you"ve got company.

70
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,563  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:439 Y2:496
Why do I get the feeling that there"s more
to you than meets the eye, Scofield?

71
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:42,115  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:471 Y2:496
Anything you wanna tell me?

72
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:48,605  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:439 Y2:496
Some other reason you"re in here
besides holding up a bank?

73
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:02,201  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:439 Y2:491
- You"re being transferred.
- What?

74
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:04,755  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:471 Y2:496
We"re moving you over to Statesville.

75
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:08,119  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:439 Y2:495
- You can"t do that.
- Yes, I can. L"m the boss here.

76
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:11,324  X1:250 X2:468 Y1:471 Y2:496
This is my house.

77
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:13,443  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:439 Y2:491
- Three weeks.
- What for?

78
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:17,566  X1:141 X2:579 Y1:439 Y2:496
Lincoln Burrows.
He"s being executed in three weeks.

79
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:20,605  X1:131 X2:589 Y1:471 Y2:496
L"m aware of that. What"s that to you?

80
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:23,076  X1:259 X2:461 Y1:471 Y2:496
He"s my brother.

81
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:28,360  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:439 Y2:496
When I knew I was being sent to prison,
my attorney petitioned the DOC.

82
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:31,484  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:439 Y2:496
- So you could be near him.
- That"s right.

83
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:36,765  X1:177 X2:543 Y1:471 Y2:496
Don"t take that away from me.

84
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:39,042  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:471 Y2:491
Not until it"s over.

85
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:42,525  X1:144 X2:576 Y1:471 Y2:491
L"m not the one behind the transfer.

86
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:45,804  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:471 Y2:496
You"re up against much bigger fish than me.

87
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:52,322  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:439 Y2:496
L"ll arrange for you to say goodbye.
You ship out tomorrow.

88
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:18,405  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:087 Y2:139
L"m going into the walls,
see if I can access the roof.

89
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:21,001  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:087 Y2:112
Were you gonna tell me about the transfer?

90
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:24,397  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:087 Y2:144
- L"m taking care of it.
- You"re taking care of it?

91
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:26,762  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:087 Y2:112
Sounds to me like you"re reaching.

92
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:29,680  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:087 Y2:112
Maybe. A little.

93
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,883  X1:314 X2:403 Y1:087 Y2:107
A little.

94
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:38,236  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:439 Y2:496
L"d made my peace, then you give me the one
thing a man in my situation shouldn"t have.

95
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:41,842  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:439 Y2:495
- Hope. And now that"s gonna be taken away.
- Don"t do this, Linc.

96
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:45,556  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:439 Y2:496
I got three weeks.
What do you want me to do?

97
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:54,846  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:439 Y2:496
Come on, Michael.
What do you want me to do?

98
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:58,919  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:439 Y2:491
- Bring her back.
- You know I can"t do that.

99
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:03,277  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:471 Y2:495
But, look, there"s some stuff that I can do.

100
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:06,518  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:439 Y2:496
It"s not gonna be the same,
but we"re gonna figure it out.

101
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:10,282  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:439 Y2:496
And no matter what,
it"s still gonna be me and you.

102
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:14,957  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:471 Y2:496
OK, but what if something happens to you?

103
00:09:15,927 --> 00:09:18,361  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:471 Y2:496
You just have a little faith.

104
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:28,607  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:471 Y2:491
Just have a little faith.

105
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:34,600  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:471 Y2:496
If we believe Lincoln, this tape is a lie.

106
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:37,918  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:439 Y2:496
- It has to be.
- But you saw it. It"s all there.

107
00:09:38,007 --> 00:09:41,841  X1:153 X2:568 Y1:439 Y2:491
But maybe what we"re looking for
is what"s not there.

108
00:09:41,927 --> 00:09:47,206  X1:095 X2:624 Y1:439 Y2:496
- OK. Steadman. See, what"s he looking at?
- A car? A pedestrian?

109
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,438  X1:181 X2:539 Y1:439 Y2:496
His eye line is high.
He"s looking into the camera.

110
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:52,597  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:471 Y2:496
He might as well be saying "cheese".

111
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:57,684  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:439 Y2:495
- Now he just sits there.
- For 10, 15 seconds, as if he was...

112
00:09:57,767 --> 00:10:00,804  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Waiting for someone.
- Right.

113
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,123  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:439 Y2:491
There. That"s a nine millimetre.
Shouldn"t there be a kick?

114
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:09,041  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Lincoln"s pretty strong.
- Yeah, but strong enough to bury a recoil?

115
00:10:09,127 --> 00:10:12,642  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:439 Y2:496
Now, you shoot someone,
supposedly for revenge.

116
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:16,925  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:439 Y2:496
Do you take the time to go in and hit
the glove box? Or get the hell out of there?

117
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:21,444  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:439 Y2:496
Feds said he was trying
to make it look like a robbery.

118
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:25,839  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:439 Y2:491
Look. Look at Lincoln"s angle
as he leaves the frame.

119
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:29,207  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:471 Y2:496
He walks away from the car.

120
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:34,600  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:439 Y2:496
Now, this guy, who conveniently hides his
face from the camera, comes back in. Why?

121
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:40,523  X1:091 X2:628 Y1:439 Y2:496
To explain the bloody pants they"d already
planted in his apartment. Nick, this is great.

122
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,916  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Who shall we go to?
- Nobody. Yet.

123
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:47,444  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:439 Y2:496
To the unbiased eye, we"re backing a horse
that died in the gate. A lot of conjecture.

124
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:50,280  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:439 Y2:491
We don"t have anything.
We need some evidence.

125
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:52,642  X1:143 X2:577 Y1:471 Y2:496
Look, if Lincoln didn"t fire this gun,

126
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:55,924  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:439 Y2:496
somebody with serious skills
worked on this to prove he did.

127
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:58,475  X1:161 X2:558 Y1:471 Y2:496
Fine, but how do we prove that?

128
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:02,439  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:439 Y2:496
- I know a guy.
- You know a guy?

129
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,438  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:471 Y2:496
Yeah, I know a guy.

130
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:07,436  X1:311 X2:407 Y1:471 Y2:491
Thanks.

131
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:11,406  X1:075 X2:642 Y1:439 Y2:496
We need to have a powwow. There"s been talk
about you packing your bags.

132
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:16,038  X1:149 X2:571 Y1:439 Y2:496
Don"t believe everything you hear.
L"m not going anywhere.

133
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:21,366  X1:099 X2:620 Y1:471 Y2:496
I have a really hard time trusting you, fish.

134
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,484  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:439 Y2:496
The important thing
is that we stay on schedule.

135
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:27,877  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Yeah? English, Fitz and Percy?
- English, Fitz or Percy.

136
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:30,083  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:471 Y2:491
Wanna know which one we should take out?

137
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:34,001  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:439 Y2:491
With all due respect, I don"t need opinions.
I need answers.

138
00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:37,966  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:439 Y2:496
The warden leaves at five tonight,
so by five after five we need that key.

139
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:40,925  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:439 Y2:496
And how is this key
gonna give you the answers?

140
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:44,602  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:439 Y2:496
L"ll worry about that.
Worry about getting the key.

141
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:47,520  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:471 Y2:496
This key better be worth it.

142
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,121  X1:281 X2:439 Y1:471 Y2:491
Understand?

143
00:11:55,487 --> 00:11:58,365  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:471 Y2:495
Afternoon, Mr Scofield.

144
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:01,280  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:439 Y2:496
I need to know
if there"s a way to block a transfer.

145
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:05,360  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:439 Y2:496
- There"s about 50 ways.
- All right. L"ll take the quickest.

146
00:12:05,447 --> 00:12:09,360  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:439 Y2:496
You file a motion for what they call
an interlocutory injunction.

147
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:12,120  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:439 Y2:496
- How long does that take?
- How fast can you write?

148
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:16,200  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:439 Y2:496
A man can claim almost anything
violates his constitutional rights.

149
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:20,724  X1:118 X2:602 Y1:439 Y2:496
Environmental issues, allergies,
religious requirements - take your pick.

150
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:24,322  X1:121 X2:598 Y1:439 Y2:496
- What if they don"t buy it?
- They"re required to hear your motion.

151
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:26,637  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:471 Y2:496
Till they do, you can"t be transferred.

152
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:31,164  X1:144 X2:576 Y1:439 Y2:496
Hell, they"ve been trying to move
my tired, grey behind for ten years.

153
00:12:31,247 --> 00:12:34,683  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:471 Y2:496
God bless the American legal system.

154
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:37,406  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:471 Y2:496
Why do you want to stay in here so badly?

155
00:12:37,487 --> 00:12:41,162  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:439 Y2:491
There"s someone here
I can"t bear to leave behind.

156
00:12:41,247 --> 00:12:45,479  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:439 Y2:496
I guess that means
we"ve got something in common.

157
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:49,685  X1:077 X2:641 Y1:439 Y2:491
- The state"s requiring a physical for Burrows.
- You heard the news?

158
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:51,803  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:439 Y2:496
- No, what?
- They"re brothers.

159
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:54,799  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:439 Y2:491
- Who?
- Burrows and Scofield.

160
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:56,036  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:471 Y2:491
Michael Scofield?

161
00:12:56,127 --> 00:13:00,166  X1:077 X2:643 Y1:439 Y2:496
Heard it from one of the COs over in Gen Pop.
He didn"t say anything about it?

162
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,441  X1:340 X2:380 Y1:471 Y2:491
No.

163
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:07,397  X1:080 X2:640 Y1:439 Y2:496
It must be hard to be so close to your brother
and not be able to do anything to help him.

164
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:16,396  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:439 Y2:496
- What"s this?
- A little bathroom reading.

165
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:21,322  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Westmoreland again?
- Scofield. He"s blocking his transfer.

166
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:27,686  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:439 Y2:496
Even if the motion is denied,
it"s gonna take 30 days to process.

167
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:30,440  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:471 Y2:491
And that means...

168
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:34,565  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:439 Y2:496
All right, l"m going in.
L"m gonna need your help.

169
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,366  X1:101 X2:618 Y1:471 Y2:496
In? Now? I thought you were waiting till...

170
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:41,406  X1:096 X2:623 Y1:439 Y2:496
I need to make sure I know how l"m getting
up there so when the time comes...

171
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,206  X1:080 X2:640 Y1:471 Y2:496
In case you didn"t notice, the lights are all on.

172
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:48,758  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:439 Y2:496
You"ve got a live studio audience, fish.
How are you gonna get around that?

173
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:51,315  X1:142 X2:578 Y1:471 Y2:496
Don"t we have some laundry to do?

174
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:57,957  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:471 Y2:495
Just to be clear,

175
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:00,277  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:471 Y2:496
I ain"t touching your drawers.

176
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:13,085  X1:235 X2:484 Y1:471 Y2:496
Eyes straight ahead.

177
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,442  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Keep it moving.
- Eyes front.

178
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:19,315  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:439 Y2:491
- Keep it moving. Keep it moving.
- Him.

179
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:40,567  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:471 Y2:496
Get him up. Hit him.

180
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:44,398  X1:315 X2:403 Y1:471 Y2:496
Get up.

181
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:46,645  X1:300 X2:418 Y1:471 Y2:491
Come on.

182
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:48,485  X1:300 X2:418 Y1:471 Y2:491
Come on.

183
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:52,036  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:471 Y2:491
Fish. I can"t deal with that.

184
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:32,404  X1:267 X2:452 Y1:471 Y2:491
Fish. Come on.

185
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:50,284  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:471 Y2:496
Yo, fish. Fish, you"re taking too long, bro.

186
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:21,396  X1:076 X2:643 Y1:439 Y2:496
This ain"t gonna fly. The Ricans, we"ve got
genetically higher blood pressure, you know?

187
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:23,796  X1:104 X2:616 Y1:471 Y2:496
My cousin, he died from too much stress.

188
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:25,957  X1:113 X2:606 Y1:471 Y2:496
You said he was moving in on your girl.

189
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:28,959  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:439 Y2:496
My other cousin,
but thanks for bringing that up.

190
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:34,041  X1:090 X2:630 Y1:471 Y2:496
Look, the good news is I can get to the roof.

191
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:36,561  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:439 Y2:491
- So what happens now?
- Now?

192
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:39,207  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:471 Y2:496
Lt"s all about timing.

193
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:15,117  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:439 Y2:496
- It"s a top-dollarjob. You know who did it?
- No. Do you?

194
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:18,085  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:439 Y2:496
People who do this kind of work
are ghosts, man.

195
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:20,806  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:439 Y2:496
The guy behind the guy behind the guy,
you know?

196
00:18:20,887 --> 00:18:24,721  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:439 Y2:496
Can you see anything that proves
the tape might have been doctored?

197
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:27,082  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:471 Y2:496
The thing"s clean. No footprints.

198
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:30,523  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:439 Y2:496
Usually, you peel the video back,
anything bogus comes off.

199
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:33,246  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:439 Y2:491
Now you see it, now you don"t.
But not this one.

200
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:36,558  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:471 Y2:496
It"s laced. Ingrained.

201
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,877  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:439 Y2:496
- You see something?
- The problem with eyes is they play tricks.

202
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:46,084  X1:183 X2:537 Y1:471 Y2:496
But your ears - ears don"t lie.

203
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,317  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:471 Y2:496
Here"s the audio track from the tape.

204
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:51,119  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:439 Y2:491
- Sounds pretty true?
- Yeah.

205
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:54,995  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:439 Y2:496
But noise is alive.
See, it doesn"tjust die like that.

206
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:57,726  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:439 Y2:496
Stripped down,
those levels should be dancing.

207
00:18:57,807 --> 00:19:02,164  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:439 Y2:496
A room that size would give you
a blam, blam, blam, blam, you know.

208
00:19:02,247 --> 00:19:04,715  X1:092 X2:627 Y1:471 Y2:496
Off each wall, a split second after the other.

209
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:08,163  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:439 Y2:496
On yours,
the reverb"s bouncing at the same time.

210
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,444  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:439 Y2:496
- What does that mean?
- The sound of a gunshot.

211
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,325  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:471 Y2:491
It wasn"t recorded in that room.

212
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:20,877  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:439 Y2:491
- Would you testify to that?
- I don"t know.

213
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:24,039  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:439 Y2:496
The tape"s a dupe.
For all I know, you guys tampered with it.

214
00:19:24,127 --> 00:19:30,316  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:439 Y2:496
Look, if you want me to testify in court, l"m
gonna need to get my hands on the original.

215
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:36,756  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:439 Y2:491
- How are those allergies?
- Excuse me?

216
00:19:36,847 --> 00:19:41,159  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:439 Y2:491
- In your motion, you cited chronic...
- Sinusitis.

217
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:44,922  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:439 Y2:491
It"s not an allergy, actually.
It"s a bacterial infection.

218
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:49,637  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:439 Y2:496
The moist air from the river along
the east wall helps keep me, you know,

219
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:51,445  X1:326 X2:392 Y1:471 Y2:491
clear.

220
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:55,406  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:439 Y2:496
L"m impressed. Not even a week here
and you"re working it like an old con.

221
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:59,036  X1:077 X2:642 Y1:439 Y2:496
You"ve got one up on me.
You know why I needed to file those motions,

222
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:02,358  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:439 Y2:496
but I have no idea
why you needed to transfer me.

223
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:06,122  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:439 Y2:491
Traffic control, Scofield.
That"s all. Traffic control.

224
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:08,801  X1:095 X2:624 Y1:471 Y2:496
It"s coming up on five o"clock. Call it a day.

225
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:11,082  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:439 Y2:496
- I don"t think I can do that.
- Why not?

226
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:14,204  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:439 Y2:496
If I let go of this support,
the whole thing"s coming down.

227
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:16,847  X1:086 X2:634 Y1:471 Y2:496
See, the Taj was designed using axial force -

228
00:20:16,927 --> 00:20:20,556  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:439 Y2:496
a series of internal forces
along the longitudinal axis.

229
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:24,959  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Yeah. How much longer?
- Depends on how long it takes to dry.

230
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:28,596  X1:109 X2:611 Y1:439 Y2:496
If you need me to leave,
I can show your secretary how to hold it.

231
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:31,042  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:471 Y2:496
You can stay. There"ll be a guard outside.

232
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:34,802  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:439 Y2:496
Just check in with Becky
and she"ll have somebody escort you back.

233
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:37,799  X1:265 X2:454 Y1:439 Y2:495
- All right.
- And, Scofield.

234
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:43,879  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:439 Y2:496
I wanna thank you for showing up today.
I would"ve understood it if you didn"t.

235
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:46,276  X1:262 X2:456 Y1:439 Y2:496
- We had a deal.
- Right.

236
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:49,518  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:471 Y2:496
Still, thanks. My wife is gonna love it.

237
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:51,757  X1:257 X2:461 Y1:471 Y2:491
You"re welcome.

238
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:05,555  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:439 Y2:496
- See you tomorrow, sir.
- Good night, Warden.

239
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:11,676  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:439 Y2:496
We"d just happen to be two people
who happen to know each other,

240
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:18,878  X1:082 X2:635 Y1:439 Y2:496
who happen to show up at the same movie
theatre at what happens to be the same time.

241
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:59,798  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:439 Y2:496
You know, from this angle, you look
just as good as you did when we first met.

242
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:03,163  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:439 Y2:491
- How about from this one?
- Even better.

243
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,323  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:471 Y2:496
Those are for your guests.

244
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:10,398  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:439 Y2:491
- Guests?
- Your associates.

245
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:14,162  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:439 Y2:496
They said you had a meeting.
They"re in the den.

246
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:23,757  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:471 Y2:496
Evening, Warden.

247
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:13,161  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:439 Y2:496
There"s nothing I can do. L"m obligated to file
every motion so a hearing can be scheduled.

248
00:23:13,247 --> 00:23:18,560  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:439 Y2:496
- And how long does that take?
- A month, maybe two. It"s out of my hands.

249
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,002  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:471 Y2:496
Why do I feel you"re not disappointed?

250
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:24,363  X1:145 X2:575 Y1:471 Y2:496
May I ask you a question, Warden?

251
00:23:24,447 --> 00:23:26,597  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:471 Y2:496
More of an observation, really.

252
00:23:26,687 --> 00:23:31,841  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:439 Y2:496
I was looking at the morgue photos
from that boy back in Toledo - Will Clayton -

253
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:36,478  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:439 Y2:496
and, my Lord,
if he wasn"t the spitting image of his daddy.

254
00:23:37,487 --> 00:23:41,116  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:439 Y2:495
The apple fell real far from the tree
with that one, didn"t it?

255
00:23:41,207 --> 00:23:44,882  X1:092 X2:628 Y1:471 Y2:496
It fell off the tree, fell all over the pavement.

256
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:47,037  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:471 Y2:491
You son of a bitch.

257
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:49,800  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:471 Y2:496
Your wife gave you a pass on the affair,

258
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,606  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:471 Y2:496
but that"s all the forgiveness she"s got left.

259
00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:55,645  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:439 Y2:496
Especially when it comes to
an illegitimate child.

260
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:58,241  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:471 Y2:496
What happened with young Will, Warden?

261
00:23:59,727 --> 00:24:03,766  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Get out of my house.
- Lose Scofield"s paperwork.

262
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:08,202  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Are you staying for dinner?
- Thanks, but I think we"re on our way.

263
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:10,721  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:471 Y2:496
Judy, it was a real pleasure.

264
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:15,437  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:439 Y2:491
Thank you. And thatjust may have been
the best iced tea l"ve ever had.

265
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:18,997  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:439 Y2:491
Warden, better do everything you can
to hold on to this one.

266
00:24:19,087 --> 00:24:21,647  X1:314 X2:404 Y1:439 Y2:491
- I will.
- Good.

267
00:24:25,607 --> 00:24:29,486  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, yeah. Just fine. I...

268
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:33,879  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:439 Y2:496
I just have a little unfinished work
to take care of. L"ll be right in.

269
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:35,764  X1:337 X2:382 Y1:471 Y2:491
OK.

270
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:14,122  X1:279 X2:441 Y1:471 Y2:491
He"s all clear.

271
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:17,165  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:439 Y2:491
- Evening, Lincoln.
- Doctor.

272
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:20,444  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:439 Y2:496
L"m supposed to give you
a physical this evening.

273
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:24,406  X1:123 X2:596 Y1:439 Y2:496
Let me apologise for the dose of irony
we"re about to participate in.

274
00:25:24,487 --> 00:25:27,160  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:471 Y2:496
It"s all right. Just doing yourjob.

275
00:25:27,247 --> 00:25:28,521  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:471 Y2:495
Yeah, well...

276
00:25:28,607 --> 00:25:34,284  X1:086 X2:633 Y1:439 Y2:496
Letting them know you"re healthy enough to
execute is not why I went to medical school.

277
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,881  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:439 Y2:491
- I apologise.
- It"s OK.

278
00:25:40,327 --> 00:25:42,795  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:471 Y2:496
All right.

279
00:25:42,887 --> 00:25:45,799  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:439 Y2:496
L"m gonna need
a family medical history from you.

280
00:25:45,887 --> 00:25:50,915  X1:076 X2:641 Y1:439 Y2:496
Any ailments or conditions
that are hereditary. Let"s start with your mom.

281
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:54,283  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:439 Y2:491
- Cancer. Liver.
- OK. Father?

282
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,642  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:471 Y2:496
Split when I was young.

283
00:25:57,727 --> 00:25:59,797  X1:305 X2:414 Y1:471 Y2:496
Siblings.

284
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:02,481  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:471 Y2:496
Anyone besides Michael?

285
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:06,883  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:471 Y2:495
Fox River"s a small town, Lincoln.

286
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:11,518  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:439 Y2:491
People around here don"t have
a whole lot to do besides time and talk.

287
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:14,358  X1:266 X2:452 Y1:471 Y2:496
Are you close?

288
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:17,485  X1:303 X2:415 Y1:471 Y2:491
We were.

289
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:22,083  X1:256 X2:464 Y1:471 Y2:491
How about now?

290
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:24,476  X1:256 X2:464 Y1:471 Y2:491
How about now?

291
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:29,520  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:471 Y2:491
He"s been abandoned his whole life.

292
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:34,156  X1:183 X2:538 Y1:471 Y2:496
Dad, Mom - she died young -

293
00:26:34,247 --> 00:26:36,841  X1:281 X2:438 Y1:471 Y2:491
and now me.

294
00:26:37,807 --> 00:26:39,798  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:471 Y2:496
Think that"s why he"s here?

295
00:26:39,887 --> 00:26:43,721  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:439 Y2:496
Cos your death would feel like
it"s happening again?

296
00:26:45,407 --> 00:26:50,356  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:439 Y2:496
I abandoned him a long time ago.
That"s why he"s here.

297
00:27:15,007 --> 00:27:17,077  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:471 Y2:496
Gates closing.

298
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:22,359  X1:299 X2:420 Y1:439 Y2:491
- It"s time.
- Time?

299
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:26,201  X1:089 X2:630 Y1:439 Y2:496
Oh, God. Here we go again.
Count"s in 15 minutes. What are you doing?

300
00:27:26,287 --> 00:27:30,724  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Trust me. The less you know, the better.
- The less I know? You got me in the dark.

301
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:33,275  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:471 Y2:496
That"s exactly where you wanna be.

302
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:42,044  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:471 Y2:496
Don"t normally find you here at this hour.

303
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:46,640  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:471 Y2:496
Are you seeking his forgiveness? Or advice?

304
00:27:48,127 --> 00:27:51,005  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:471 Y2:496
I really don"t know any more, Ben.

305
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:56,717  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:439 Y2:496
All I know is my son Will
was my responsibility.

306
00:27:57,727 --> 00:28:03,597  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:439 Y2:496
- If l"d stayed in his life, I could"ve saved it.
- His death was an accident, Henry.

307
00:28:06,647 --> 00:28:08,638  X1:248 X2:472 Y1:471 Y2:495
He was a criminal,

308
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:13,084  X1:090 X2:629 Y1:471 Y2:496
and an addict, but he was only 18 years old.

309
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:17,763  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:439 Y2:496
His mother made it clear you couldn"t be
in his life if you weren"t gonna be in hers.

310
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:21,396  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:439 Y2:496
When you chose to stay with Judy,
you understood that.

311
00:28:21,487 --> 00:28:24,285  X1:088 X2:632 Y1:471 Y2:496
I not only understood it, I was grateful for it.

312
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:29,439  X1:105 X2:615 Y1:471 Y2:496
I told myself I was respecting her wishes.

313
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:34,958  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:439 Y2:496
I cursed her under my breath
while every day I thanked God

314
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,959  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:471 Y2:496
for allowing me to wash my hands of her.

315
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:40,117  X1:295 X2:423 Y1:471 Y2:491
Of Toledo.

316
00:28:41,927 --> 00:28:44,122  X1:310 X2:408 Y1:471 Y2:491
All of it.

317
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:48,087  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:471 Y2:495
So I ran home,

318
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:50,681  X1:309 X2:409 Y1:471 Y2:496
to Judy,

319
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:53,235  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:471 Y2:491
and I buried the secret.

320
00:28:54,847 --> 00:28:58,237  X1:185 X2:535 Y1:471 Y2:496
But I never got a chance to...

321
00:28:58,327 --> 00:29:01,637  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:471 Y2:496
to bury my... my son.

322
00:29:13,247 --> 00:29:16,284  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:471 Y2:496
What kind of a person does that, Ben?

323
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:21,805  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:439 Y2:496
Sacrifices somebody else"s life
just to make their own life easier.

324
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:28,525  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:439 Y2:496
You can argue with me all night. Believe me,
I haven"t got anything better to do.

325
00:29:28,607 --> 00:29:33,840  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:439 Y2:496
But it won"t change the fact that I can"t
just hand out original copies of evidence.

326
00:29:33,927 --> 00:29:38,478  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:439 Y2:496
- If you could just take a look...
- I don"t care. I can"t give it to you.

327
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:42,446  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:439 Y2:496
What if we brought somebody here?
Your supervisor could monitor them.

328
00:29:42,527 --> 00:29:45,519  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:439 Y2:491
He"d strip down and swear
on a stack of Bibles. Whatever.

329
00:29:45,607 --> 00:29:48,565  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:439 Y2:491
Wait. What did you say
the docket number was?

330
00:29:48,647 --> 00:29:52,481  X1:285 X2:435 Y1:471 Y2:491
Lt"s 296 SPE.

331
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:55,639  X1:259 X2:460 Y1:439 Y2:491
- What"s wrong?
- Come with me.

332
00:30:00,687 --> 00:30:04,282  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:439 Y2:496
Last night a pipe burst upstairs,
flooded the place.

333
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:09,680  X1:081 X2:639 Y1:439 Y2:496
Files from over 100 cases -
pretty much lost all of them, including yours.

334
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:13,043  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:439 Y2:491
- Just this room?
- Some kind of freak accident.

335
00:30:24,927 --> 00:30:28,237  X1:245 X2:474 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Count "em.
- Callahan, Knight.

336
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:31,483  X1:235 X2:484 Y1:471 Y2:495
Malinowski, Pohlen.

337
00:31:14,447 --> 00:31:17,280  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:471 Y2:495
Chance, Graziano.

338
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:20,006  X1:263 X2:456 Y1:471 Y2:495
Scofield, Sucre.

339
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:30,636  X1:175 X2:544 Y1:471 Y2:496
Scofield, get the hell out here.

340
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:42,403  X1:257 X2:461 Y1:471 Y2:496
We got a runner.

341
00:31:56,367 --> 00:31:58,801  X1:293 X2:427 Y1:471 Y2:491
Lockdown.

342
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:01,242  X1:292 X2:426 Y1:471 Y2:491
Lockdown!

343
00:32:12,287 --> 00:32:15,120  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:471 Y2:496
All right. For the last time, piñata.

344
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:19,246  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:439 Y2:496
Where the hell"s Scofield?
He"s gone, you"re gone. You hear me?

345
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:22,285  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:439 Y2:496
Call it off, Captain.
I got Scofield right here.

346
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:25,837  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:439 Y2:491
- Where?
- In the warden"s office.

347
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:28,077  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:471 Y2:496
Are you looking at him?

348
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:33,036  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:439 Y2:491
Stop trying to nail the secretary
and check the damn office.

349
00:32:38,487 --> 00:32:41,206  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:471 Y2:496
Captain, he"s gone.

350
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:42,122  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:439 Y2:495
- The man can"tjust vanish.
- I know, sir.

351
00:33:42,207 --> 00:33:45,563  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:439 Y2:491
- He never checked out? The rear door?
- Still locked. I checked.

352
00:33:45,647 --> 00:33:47,922  X1:223 X2:497 Y1:471 Y2:491
How the hell did he?

353
00:33:48,007 --> 00:33:50,805  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:439 Y2:491
- What"s going on?
- You"re in the warden"s office.

354
00:33:50,887 --> 00:33:54,436  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:439 Y2:491
I could kill you and the paperwork
wouldn"t need more than a date.

355
00:33:54,527 --> 00:33:59,078  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Tell me, what were you doing in here?
- All right, Deputy. That"s enough.

356
00:34:00,887 --> 00:34:04,277  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:439 Y2:496
The work wasn"t dry.
You said to stay until it was.

357
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:06,198  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:439 Y2:495
- You were in here?
- Yes, sir.

358
00:34:06,287 --> 00:34:09,404  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:439 Y2:491
- It"s true. I never saw him leave.
- I must not have seen him.

359
00:34:09,487 --> 00:34:13,639  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:439 Y2:491
This is ridiculous. This prisoner
was out of his cell. He missed the count.

360
00:34:13,727 --> 00:34:15,877  X1:228 X2:492 Y1:471 Y2:496
I understand, Deputy.

361
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:19,357  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:439 Y2:496
The thing is,
Mr Scofield is not our problem any more.

362
00:34:19,447 --> 00:34:22,803  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:439 Y2:496
There was an error in his paperwork.
He"s gonna be transferred.

363
00:34:22,887 --> 00:34:25,003  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:471 Y2:496
That"s not possible.

364
00:34:25,087 --> 00:34:27,601  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:471 Y2:496
Escort the prisoner back to his cell.

365
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:30,121  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:471 Y2:495
Warden, all I need is three weeks.

366
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:31,640  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:439 Y2:491
- Get off me!
- Come on!

367
00:34:31,727 --> 00:34:34,605  X1:129 X2:591 Y1:471 Y2:496
Henry, please. I just need a little time.

368
00:34:34,687 --> 00:34:37,076  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:471 Y2:496
Just give me the time.

369
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:42,199  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:439 Y2:491
Any chance you want to write this off
as a coincidence?

370
00:34:42,287 --> 00:34:43,606  X1:292 X2:428 Y1:471 Y2:491
Me neither.

371
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:47,396  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:439 Y2:496
How could they know we were coming?
Three hours ago, we didn"t know.

372
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:51,196  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:439 Y2:496
- We"re pissing someone off.
- You say that like it"s a good thing.

373
00:34:51,287 --> 00:34:56,156  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:439 Y2:496
People start breaking the law,
you know you"re getting warm.

374
00:34:57,207 --> 00:35:00,802  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:471 Y2:496
We still have our copy of the tape, so maybe...

375
00:35:04,247 --> 00:35:06,636  X1:290 X2:428 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Nick.
- Stay here.

376
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:26,243  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:439 Y2:496
Whoever it was has gone.
Does it look like they got anything?

377
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:28,602  X1:340 X2:380 Y1:471 Y2:491
No.

378
00:35:33,127 --> 00:35:36,915  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:471 Y2:496
Everything"s exactly the way I left it.

379
00:35:44,647 --> 00:35:47,115  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:471 Y2:491
What? What?

380
00:35:49,487 --> 00:35:51,955  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:439 Y2:496
- What?
- The tape. It"s gone.

381
00:35:52,047 --> 00:35:53,685  X1:265 X2:454 Y1:439 Y2:491
- Are you sure?
- How?

382
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:56,122  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Think this through.
- How could they know?

383
00:35:56,207 --> 00:35:58,357  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:439 Y2:491
- Wait. Does anyone else have a key?
- No.

384
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:02,281  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:439 Y2:496
- Are you sure this is where you put it?
- You were here. I was talking to you.

385
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:06,155  X1:114 X2:606 Y1:471 Y2:495
I walked toward the cabinet, and I said...

386
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:09,278  X1:319 X2:399 Y1:471 Y2:491
What?

387
00:36:10,287 --> 00:36:12,562  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:471 Y2:496
Veronica, are you OK?

388
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:19,758  X1:301 X2:417 Y1:471 Y2:491
Veronica.

389
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:29,685  X1:303 X2:414 Y1:471 Y2:496
Open up!

390
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:33,555  X1:140 X2:580 Y1:471 Y2:496
Breakfast, gentlemen. Let"s move it.

391
00:36:33,647 --> 00:36:38,846  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:439 Y2:496
Sucre, let"s go. Scofield, wait here.
L"m sure your ride"ll be along any minute now.

392
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:48,041  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:471 Y2:491
This can"t be it.

393
00:36:48,127 --> 00:36:50,197  X1:237 X2:483 Y1:471 Y2:491
It can"t end like this.

394
00:36:50,287 --> 00:36:52,437  X1:278 X2:442 Y1:471 Y2:491
Let"s move it.

395
00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:55,360  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:439 Y2:491
- Fitz.
- What?

396
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,597  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:471 Y2:496
We were gonna take Fitz out.

397
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:01,167  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:471 Y2:496
It was as clear as day.

398
00:37:02,647 --> 00:37:08,199  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:439 Y2:496
And the cops? How long did it take them
to respond? You got all the timing down?

399
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:13,561  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:471 Y2:491
Think we would"ve made it?

400
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:17,523  X1:287 X2:431 Y1:471 Y2:495
Sucre, now.

401
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:27,881  X1:136 X2:584 Y1:471 Y2:496
Hey, fish face, where are you going?

402
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:43,875  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:439 Y2:496
Call my wife. Tell her to get the kids
and get the hell out of the country.

403
00:38:58,807 --> 00:39:00,001  X1:322 X2:396 Y1:471 Y2:496
Sorry.

404
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:23,965  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:471 Y2:496
Don"t forget to buckle up.

405
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:30,999  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:439 Y2:496
- What"s he doing out of his cell?
- He"s being transferred.

406
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:34,762  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:439 Y2:496
No, there must be some mistake.
This man filed a motion yesterday.

407
00:39:34,847 --> 00:39:38,157  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:439 Y2:496
He has a medical condition
which precludes transfer.

408
00:39:38,247 --> 00:39:40,283  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:471 Y2:496
Sinusitis, right?

409
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:42,722  X1:301 X2:417 Y1:471 Y2:491
Sinusitis.

410
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:48,279  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:439 Y2:496
Take the prisoner back to his cell. But yank
his rec time. He missed count last night.

411
00:40:29,247 --> 00:40:32,125  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:471 Y2:496
You"re home early. Everything OK?

412
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:35,085  X1:257 X2:461 Y1:471 Y2:495
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,397  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:471 Y2:496
There"s just...

414
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:44,118  X1:325 X2:393 Y1:471 Y2:496
Judy,

415
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:51,405  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:471 Y2:496
there"s someone I need to tell you about.

416
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:56,122  X1:329 X2:390 Y1:471 Y2:491
Yes?

417
00:40:56,207 --> 00:40:59,916  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:439 Y2:496
- The transfer did not go through.
- Disappointing.

418
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:03,841  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:439 Y2:491
- We can refile, but...
- It"s a waste of time.

419
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:07,044  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:439 Y2:496
I think it"s time we stopped
beating around the bush,

420
00:41:07,127 --> 00:41:09,595  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:471 Y2:496
and go after the damn bush.

421
00:41:10,487 --> 00:41:14,241  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:471 Y2:496
Burrows. What do you want done?

422
00:41:14,327 --> 00:41:17,524  X1:093 X2:626 Y1:471 Y2:496
Take the only thing Burrows has left - time.

423
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:22,317  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:439 Y2:496
After all, the chair isn"t the only way
to take a man"s life in prison.

424
00:41:55,527 --> 00:41:58,325  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:439 Y2:496
