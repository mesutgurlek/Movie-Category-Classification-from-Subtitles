127
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:16,970
My best decision i have ever made.

128
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:18,894
seriously,I've never been happier.

129
00:09:18,895 --> 00:09:21,066
I can do whatever I want.

130
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:23,863

And I want take my top off

133
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:34,242
Three guys at once?
that's a nightmare.

134
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:36,636
This is literally reccuring
stress that I have.

135
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:39,894
i don't understand what you want?
-i feel like, we know each other too well.

136
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:43,086

the same schedule ...

137

Yes, rare. is why
I was surprised.

140
00:09:53,974 --> 00:09:57,023
You are a lot like Naserin, Claire.

141
00:09:57,024 --> 00:10:00,096

142
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:02,582
Why are talking about me?
You're the one that going crazy ...

143
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:06,846
You're like Naserin because you are ashamed
of how vibrant you are.

144
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:09,152
You deserve to feel sexy, Claire.

145
00:10:09,187 --> 00:10:13,626
And you need to walk among the birds.
- yeah, i don't really understand that metaphor.

146
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:17,531
It is not ...
- And Phil make me vibrant in different way ...

147
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:20,307
We have a date tomorrow night.

150
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:34,455

Or I suck on a napkin.
Holy ... look at this prices.

218
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:19,601
If we gonna pay this much for crab,
the best is he sing, dance ...

219
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:21,855

The Little Mermaid.

220
00:15:24,218 --> 00:15:27,066
hey, here's for a great night.

221
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:31,141
anyway, isn't a bad luck to
toast to an empty glass?

222
00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:33,395
I don't think, that's a thing.

223
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,743
I would trade our kids
for life this plan.

224
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:44,054
You're so mean.
- It would be cool.

225
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:56,954

227
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:04,170
and she is getting drunk enough
to get through to what gonna happen later.

228
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:06,166
Because he likes to do weird stuff.

229
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,044

her mom names.

230
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:16,577
okay, back here, what's the story?

231
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:22,365
He is a record producer, and she
is an actor he want to sign.

232
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:28,564

235
00:16:36,744 --> 00:16:40,292

- No,this is dump.

239
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:51,762
And you're gonna make fool of yourself.

240
00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:54,126

We just wanted to have a few

248
00:17:33,455 --> 00:17:36,596
And what is this about?

249
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:40,842
why don't we save a lot of embarrassment,
have this conversation in private.

250
00:17:40,843 --> 00:17:43,816
okay, but can i have my rest of the meal on wrap?

251
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:47,062

252
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,704
Get out. Now.

253
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:53,901

00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:17,153
Watch your step.

259
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:21,516
Come on guys, what's a big deal
we didn't hurt anyone, right?

260
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,499
If I were you, I wouldn't
say another word, bitch.

261
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:29,325

264
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:41,447
Now I'm gonna have to pick that rosatto over
the ground to eat it.

00:18:41,448 --> 00:18:46,103
I wanna to talk to your boss right now.
-i think we both now, that's not gonna happen, Mr. Tripplehorn.

266
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:48,420
Or should I say ...

267
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:50,392
Phil Foster?

268
00:18:50,488 --> 00:18:52,223
next time you make a dinner reservation

269
00:18:52,224 --> 00:18:54,781
don't uses the same aliases as your ransom
notes, genius.

270
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:57,817
ransom notes?
- Did you really think ...

271
00:18:57,913 --> 00:19:00,434
you can steal from Joe Miletto,
and get away with it?

272
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:03,486
okay, someone somewhere is making a huge mistake.

273
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:05,369
Guys, seriously this is ...

274
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,568
this is just a big goofy misunderstanding.
We are Phil and Claire Foster ...

275
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:13,184
we don't know anything about ransom notes.
I assure you.

276
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,318
You sitting at the table.
The girl in front said ...

277
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,541
that you were the Tripplehorn.
- No, no ...

278
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:20,967
Let me explain.
My husband, very sweetly, but ...

279
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:24,397
delusionaly thought that we could make it here
earlier enough, to get a table...

280
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:27,431
and we didn't, we were late.
so, they were very rude to us.

281
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:31,129
they were so rude.
- and we heard them calling for the reservation of Tripplehorn ...

282
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,869
and we just "us!".
We just took it.

283
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,695
So you just took somebody elses
reservation?

284
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:40,090
for the record, I was against it.
but my husband get his plan in his head ...

285
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:42,666
and it become like a thing.
- I'm an idiot, sometimes.

286
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:43,996
Shut up.

287
00:19:45,762 --> 00:19:48,532
I  believed you are the Fosters.
- Thank you.

288
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:51,029
I also believe you go by the aliases
Tripplehorn...

289
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,862
and you stole my boss property ...

290
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:55,245
and now you get too scared cheatless
to admit it.

291
00:19:55,246 --> 00:19:58,208
I will give you three seconds
to give us back the Flash Drive!

292
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:01,871
okay, the three-seconds game?
you know, I this play every day with my kids.

293
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:05,568
This is a different version!
- one ...

294
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:08,154
ok, big mistake, this is all, there's a thing ...
- Two ...

295
00:20:08,922 --> 00:20:13,327

296
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:15,073
Help!

297
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:19,044
No, no. All right,

298
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:21,570
What?
-I thought so

299
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:23,607
Where is this?

300
00:20:24,338 --> 00:20:27,629
It's in the park.
- The park?

301
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:31,362
could you be more specific.

302
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:34,027
the Central Park.

303
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,478
okay, this is what gonna happen.

304
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:40,649
we're all gonna take a little field trip to
to the Central Park ...

305
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:44,428
and you gonna show us exactly
where it is. okay?

306
00:20:46,502 --> 00:20:49,539
Okay.
- move!

307
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:19,372
Why did you bring us to
the most isolate place in New York?

308
00:21:19,373 --> 00:21:22,134
i don't know, the gun was sideways!
- We gotta go to place populated.

309
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:26,275
Maybe there will be people,
maybe some reacreational games..

310
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,664
Night Boating?
- Yes, very popular here. i dont know you recall about it

311
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:31,428
we will be fine.

312
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:35,747
We need to go to the boathouse.
- get out.

313
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:51,568
There's nobody here.

314
00:21:55,076 --> 00:21:58,663
okay, you know, the night boating thing
was in Seattle.

315
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:02,607
i think, I make a blast whole track
a little bit here.

316
00:22:02,642 --> 00:22:04,844
Open the door.

317
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,781
i think, you gonna have to break in,
cause I don't have a key.

318
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:15,927
Stay put.

319
00:22:21,151 --> 00:22:23,090
We have to get people immediately.

320
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,488
you tell them that you have a condition.
and we need a medicine

321
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:26,959
you left the medicine in the car
that medicine, ...

322
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,704
only can administered
by a doctor

323
00:22:28,705 --> 00:22:30,593
god, Why?
- It's for your penis.

324
00:22:30,594 --> 00:22:32,696
Intravenous penis medicine,
and you're very shy.

325
00:22:32,697 --> 00:22:35,752
We have to get to a nearest hospital.
- What is wrong with my penis?

326
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:40,980
let's go.

327
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:51,479
moving, man.

328
00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:55,495
Where is it?
- okay, here the the problem

329
00:22:55,496 --> 00:23:00,082
Phil has kind of a serious medical issue ...
- Claire, just give them the flash drive.

330
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:07,024
Claire, just give it to them.
- We need to get to a hospital.

331
00:23:07,025 --> 00:23:09,552
But your penis.

332
00:23:09,553 --> 00:23:13,549
It is a two-step procedure
and it's need to be done by a nurse.

333
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:17,656
Because there is a two-step ...
- My penis is fine!

334
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:22,265
and that can be a lot of blood.
- Show me where it is!

335
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:24,851
Come on!
- be a good girl.

336
00:23:24,852 --> 00:23:28,776
And listen to your husband.
- Yeah, be a good girl, listen to me.

337
00:23:33,285 --> 00:23:36,474
okay, I put the flash drive over there, in the corner.

338
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:39,689
Where in the corner? Show us.

339
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,910
Come on, it's not a game.

340
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,633
you're gonna have to lift this floorboard.

341
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:54,159
in there.

342
00:23:57,701 --> 00:23:59,792
This is one.

343
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:10,602
It's somewhere in here.
- Where? I don't see it.

344
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:18,934
let's go!

345
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,145
Come on.

346
00:24:22,146 --> 00:24:24,945
Here.

347
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:34,738
Come on!

348
00:24:39,556 --> 00:24:41,770
crank it.
- This is crank.

349
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,487
Come on.

350
00:25:06,427 --> 00:25:09,240
Pick it up. Run.

351
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:12,338
We are going to die!

352
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:14,349
I don't want the kids
to live with your mother!

353
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,232
She's awful!
- wait, can you see?

354
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:19,112
No!

355
00:25:38,761 --> 00:25:44,268
How the hell, did this happen?
- They sure are not at all like they seem.

356
00:25:44,947 --> 00:25:48,578
You're dead, you're hear me!
you are dead!

357
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:06,691
are you okay?

358
00:26:07,986 --> 00:26:10,386
oh god. Phil, come on.

359
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:14,910
We doesn't work cardio.

360
00:26:14,911 --> 00:26:17,394
I'm not in bad condition.
I'm afraid.

361
00:26:17,395 --> 00:26:19,706
me too.

362
00:26:19,707 --> 00:26:21,836
you're done?

363
00:26:24,725 --> 00:26:27,529
let it out.

364
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,280
let it all out.

365
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:32,824
oh, My God, are you bleeding?
- This is the Cabernet.

366
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:40,159
i'm sorry, do you have a gum?

367
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,097
i'm sorry, you gonna have to forgive me
i'm been working nine hours.

368
00:26:48,098 --> 00:26:52,509
so, one more time, you were at the dinner where?
- at Claw.

369
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,408
That place in Tribeca,
with 50 $ soup?

370
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:58,423
How that work out for you?
- Not great.

371
00:26:58,424 --> 00:27:01,904
We coudn't get a table, so we ended up taking
somebody elses reservations.

372
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:05,583
You took someone reservation?
- Yup.

373
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:08,117
We took it.
- You just took a table.

374
00:27:08,118 --> 00:27:11,005
Just like that?
- we know, shocking.

375
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:14,795
so, we were middle of dinner
and these guys come up ...

376
00:27:14,796 --> 00:27:17,270
turned up this guy work for
Joe Miletto.

377
00:27:17,271 --> 00:27:19,532
That what they said.
When didn't know it at that time.

378
00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:22,905
We thought they were just guys from the restaurant.
So we followed into the alley ...

379
00:27:22,906 --> 00:27:26,978
and suddenly they just grab all our stuff.
That's why we don't have our ID on us.

380
00:27:27,556 --> 00:27:29,717
then,yeah, that was scary. what?

381
00:27:29,718 --> 00:27:33,674
Then they start waves gun around
then the talking about a flash drive.

382
00:27:33,675 --> 00:27:38,288
honey, why did you grab on my knee?
- Because i just remembered that we are supposed
to meet our friend.

383
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:42,306
who are a gay couple,
the one we met on the night boating.

384
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:48,812
oh, my God! The Bald and The Crazy.

385
00:27:48,813 --> 00:27:55,115
Gay couple, shit.
We forgot our gay couple dinner.

386
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:58,114
Can I say something?

387
00:27:58,115 --> 00:28:00,854
Joe Miletto is not a nice man ...

388
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:04,181
So, if you some out blinking on his radar,
we need to talk about how we can help you...

389
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,986
No, you do not understand.
We took somebody reservation ...

390
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:10,183
So we need to undo what we've done.
- Stop!

391
00:28:11,015 --> 00:28:13,151
sit down!

392
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:16,825
Arroyo?
- Yes?

393
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:18,430

394
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,481

395
00:28:24,739 --> 00:28:26,573

396
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,476

397
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:33,166
because that guys are cops.

398
00:28:34,116 --> 00:28:37,593
Why are cops
involved? What is going on, Phil?

399
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:41,166
What are we going to do?
- Honey.

400
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:45,282
They're gonna kill us.
then, they're gonna burn our bodies in trash bag.

401
00:28:45,283 --> 00:28:47,983
Breathe. are you breathing?
- Only in.

402
00:28:47,984 --> 00:28:50,447

403
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:59,545
Your eyes look crazy.
- I know, because i'm losing what we gonna do?

404
00:28:59,546 --> 00:29:03,450
What we gonna do?
- We got to get out of here, we got to go home.

405
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:06,449
We can't go home.
-what are you talking about. Phil, I am going home.

406
00:29:06,484 --> 00:29:12,908
I'm going home.
- Claire, they have our ID. They know where we live.

407
00:29:12,941 --> 00:29:15,861
oh My God, the kids.

408
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,476
hello
-do you accept to collect a phone call from ...

409
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:31,518
My God, this phone smells like a urine.
- Yes, I accept.

410
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,108
Katy, are the kids are okay?is everything okay?
- Yes.

411
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:38,590
okay, listen to me, I'm gonna need you to stay
a litte late tonight.

412
00:29:38,591 --> 00:29:41,137
That is gonna be a problem for me.
- What?

413
00:29:41,138 --> 00:29:44,687
I actually have a party to get to.
- You talk to her.

414
00:29:44,688 --> 00:29:49,986
Katy, hi it's Phil. I don't have time
to talk right now, I'll pay you double.

415
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:52,017
I do not think enough.
- Are you kidding me?

416
00:29:52,018 --> 00:29:56,479
I could miss the party, but I think
great pleasure to talk to someone worth than thirty.

417
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,193
I see them.
- An hour? okay,fine.

418
00:30:00,194 --> 00:30:05,104
just, get the kids out of the house right now.
don't go out the front door, go out at the back door.
take them to your house

419
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:07,890
Now it sounds some kind i'm in a danger here.
- No.

420
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:11,735
cause, that gonna run you extra five per hour.
- Fine, just get the kids out right now.

421
00:30:11,736 --> 00:30:15,181
We love them, and everything is gonna be okay.
- tell we love them.

422
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:18,742
sucker. kids.
- now what?

423
00:30:18,743 --> 00:30:21,805
They are safe. We need to find a some place
with a lot of people.

424
00:30:29,616 --> 00:30:32,385
This is whole night was a mistake.
We are not these peoples.

425
00:30:32,386 --> 00:30:35,506
We're just a boring couple from New Jersey,
this is a crazy idea.

426
00:30:35,507 --> 00:30:37,830
no, it wasn't a crazy idea.
It was a dinner in Manhattan ...

427
00:30:37,831 --> 00:30:40,220
one night where we don't want to
talk about the kids the whole night

428
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:43,183
or what we gonna do next week.
- Look where it brought us.

429
00:30:43,184 --> 00:30:46,722
Should we call 911?
- honey, this is Joe Miletto we are talking about.

430
00:30:46,723 --> 00:30:48,892
so?
- so, those cops are try to kill us ...

431
00:30:48,893 --> 00:30:51,501
they are his pocket.
This guy owns cops.

432
00:30:51,502 --> 00:30:53,909
We can't trust any cops.
- What we gonna do?

433
00:30:53,944 --> 00:30:55,829
We can't go home, we can't
go to the police.

434
00:30:56,939 --> 00:31:00,059
Miletto, he wants the Tripplehorn, why?

435
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,814
Because they have the Flash Drive.

436
00:31:01,848 --> 00:31:06,021
okay, what if they gave the flash drive back?
- Why would they do that?

437
00:31:06,022 --> 00:31:08,713
Because we gonna find them
and we make them do it.

438
00:31:08,714 --> 00:31:10,716
If they have the Flash Drive
this is over.

439
00:31:10,717 --> 00:31:13,831
okay, I like that, i'm completely with you.
I just want to ask you one question.

440
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:18,738
do not judge me. What is a Flash Drive?
- Seriously?

441
00:31:18,739 --> 00:31:23,216
Phil, I can't.
- okay, it's a little device that we stick on the side of a laptop.

442
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:27,791
oh, it's a computer sticky thing?
in my office, we call it computer sticky thing.

443
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:30,589
okay, we need to get the computer sticky thing
to save our lives.

444
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:35,100
How? We don't know anything about the Tripplehorn.
- That's sound entirely true.

445
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,994
We know where they gonna have dinner tonight.

446
00:31:38,654 --> 00:31:40,867
Come on.

447
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:51,343
Hello, up here. We were in here earlier
having dinner with our friend 'Sam.I.Am.

448
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:53,848
You mean Will.I.Am?

449
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:55,573
that you call them so that's weird.
i don't like that.

450
00:31:55,574 --> 00:32:00,002
We were here, and Will.I.Am thinks he
left his phone on the table, so ...

451
00:32:00,036 --> 00:32:02,625
so, we need to check on the table.
- I like to check the table for the phone.

452
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:04,571
If you don't mind.
- You understand what I'm saying? Look at me.

453
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:07,648
We need to check the table fot the phone.

454
00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:12,292
oh my gosh, how are you not getting this.
we need to check the table fot the phone?
- Fine.

455
00:32:12,293 --> 00:32:14,900
This way.
-wow, I just wasted half my life.

456
00:32:20,086 --> 00:32:23,372
check the monitor.

457
00:32:24,413 --> 00:32:32,444
he left there, he say he left it on the table,
well, that was just a big fat waste of time.

458
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:35,763
The King of Siam is going be living.

459
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:39,333
Thank you for all of your help,
I'm being sarcastic.

460
00:32:41,244 --> 00:32:43,536
Mother fuck.

461
00:32:44,873 --> 00:32:47,889
Claw, you're welcome.

462
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:52,276
We have a phone number. How does we use it
to find their address?

463
00:32:52,984 --> 00:32:55,777
I think I know someone
who can help.

464
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:58,466
wait, how do you know this guy again?

465
00:32:58,467 --> 00:33:00,252
I show him a bunches houses
in the state.

466
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:04,182
It was a few years ago, but I remember
he was some kind of security expert.

467
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:07,829
anyway, he ended find a place down here
from an agent in this office.

468
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,299
I forgot the address, but maybe
we can find it in a file.

469
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,750
Got a key?
- No, i don't. can I have your coat?

470
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:15,934
Yeah, you're cold?
I think we just pick the lock.

471
00:33:16,335 --> 00:33:20,877
If I had a bobby pin
be able gets the lock open.

472
00:33:25,161 --> 00:33:28,188
My God, who are you?
- Here, come on.

473
00:33:29,432 --> 00:33:33,327
No, hon. we gotta get out.
- It takes only a minute.

474
00:33:34,058 --> 00:33:38,036
His name is Holbrooke, Grant, you check
the file in cabinets. I'll find in the computer.

475
00:33:48,797 --> 00:33:51,136
Come on.

476
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:54,313
Come on, rainbow wheel.

477
00:33:54,314 --> 00:33:57,253
Come on.
- That's a bad sound.

478
00:33:59,984 --> 00:34:02,506
I got it.
- okay,go. let's go.

479
00:34:07,527 --> 00:34:10,237
here we go. let's go.

480
00:34:29,312 --> 00:34:31,817

481
00:34:31,818 --> 00:34:34,889
can you join me?

482
00:34:36,497 --> 00:34:39,356
Why are you mess with a nice couple
from the burbs, Joe?

483
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:42,343
Isn't that little beneath
your pay grade?

484
00:34:42,973 --> 00:34:47,383
This conversation would be even better
If I knew what you were talking about.

485
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,147
Phil and Claire Foster.

486
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:52,162
a couple of your goongs pick them up
earlier tonight at Claw.

487
00:34:52,163 --> 00:34:54,818
They put a good scare into of them too.
Joe, you know what I'm talking about.

488
00:34:55,785 --> 00:35:00,042
not ringing any bells. So unless
you want my date tonight ...

489
00:35:00,043 --> 00:35:02,683

490
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,869
hey Slick, do we have a problem?

491
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:23,058
This is it.

492
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,158
This is the place.

493
00:35:32,895 --> 00:35:36,614
hi, Hoolbroke, you might not remember me.

494
00:35:36,615 --> 00:35:39,746
I am a real estate agent.
I showed you some places out state.

495
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:45,101
Claire. Yeah, I remember. It's pretty late.
-No, I know, and I'm so sorry.

496
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:50,086
This is an emergency. Could I just come up for a second?
It is very important.

497
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:52,938
alright, come on up.

498
00:35:56,401 --> 00:35:59,930
I can't believe out of hundreds of clients
you remember this one guy.

499
00:35:59,931 --> 00:36:01,810
well, I've always been good
with names and faces.

500
00:36:01,845 --> 00:36:03,960
it's amazing that you recall like that, honey.

501
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:06,903
all the people that you see,

502
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:09,548

503
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:21,049
I get flashbacks of all
all those empty houses we saw.

504
00:36:21,827 --> 00:36:24,201
We did look in a lot.

505
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:28,239
That's me.

506
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:34,471
This is my husband, Phil Foster.
- hey, whats up man?

507
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:39,833
listen, we have some troubles, and
we really need help.

508
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:43,054
I know it's late, but if
we just could come up, for one second ...

509
00:36:43,055 --> 00:36:47,244
it's a relly an amazing story, and you
might be just of kind of man that could help us.

514
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:10,079
which is why we are hoping that you would help us.
- That's the least I can do.

515
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,870
i mean, you are so patient with me.
All those long drive uptown .

516
00:37:13,871 --> 00:37:16,907

This is definitely the right place for you.

517
00:37:16,908 --> 00:37:20,631

- It's alright.

518
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:23,663

519
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:29,811

We don't have a lot of time ...

520
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:34,289

and then we will get what we need, and ...

521
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,023
then we'll be out from here.
- basically, we have a phone number that we need ...

522
00:37:37,024 --> 00:37:42,048

intelligence for government black ops ...

524
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:49,274

525
00:37:49,307 --> 00:37:53,395
There's is your shirt. No wonder you
couldn't find it. It's on her.

526
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,420

531
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:35,114
when I was working with the Mossad,
she is a sweet girl.

532
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:38,602
She seems really sweet. It was very nice
her to ask us to have sex.

533
00:38:39,336 --> 00:38:42,443
so, you wanna give me that number.

534
00:38:46,025 --> 00:38:48,537
We haven't seen the last of
Mr. and Mrs. Foster.

535
00:38:48,538 --> 00:38:51,335
Somebody trip an alarm

Tripplehorn probably an alias.

550
00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:56,779

551
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:00,932
There is no address.

552
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:03,413
well, It's a cell phone, Claire.
We don't need address.

553

558
00:40:37,057 --> 00:40:42,227
Are you expecting someone?
- Mr. Grant, this is the NYPD. We need to ask a few questions..

559
00:40:42,228 --> 00:40:44,575

I'm kind of busy.

561
00:40:53,153 --> 00:40:56,374

What was that?

562
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:58,129
Is there another way out of here?

563
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,575

-You can't do this, Phil. this is Holbrooke's car.

569
00:41:24,155 --> 00:41:26,882
we have to get out here fast.
Do you have a better idea?

570
00:41:33,612 --> 00:41:38,379
That's not really driving in the city.

571
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,337
This is a sports car.

572
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:45,525
well, thank God for Holbrooke, right.
- Yup.

573
00:41:45,526 --> 00:41:47,947

Who is that person?

576

578
00:42:02,246 --> 00:42:04,759

-okay, that is not true.

579

580
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,398
He is super hot. And why do you need
muscles on your shoulders ?

581
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:15,477
like that.
And I'm just the husband.

582
00:42:15,478 --> 00:42:19,149
i'm just a dork who doesn't know
how to load the dishwasher.

583
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,091
I'm the guy who need to workout more.

584
00:42:22,092 --> 00:42:27,076
who lights up for the husband?
- oh my god. you are right. I keep forgetting to light up for you.

585
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:29,497

- Why do i keep forgetting to do that?

586
00:42:29,498 --> 00:42:32,837

It's because every day i get up ...

587

00:42:53,621 --> 00:42:57,896
to physically put myself into our bed,
instead of lighting up for you.

594
00:42:57,897 --> 00:43:01,619
yeah, let's pull over.
This is a great time to ...

595
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,117
Yes, we have to pull over.
I know you work hard, honey.

596
00:43:04,118 --> 00:43:06,616
But you know what make all that hard work
ten times easier?

597
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,727
me.

598
00:43:08,728 --> 00:43:12,148
If you just trust me to handle
things once in a while. But no, you don't.

599
00:43:12,149 --> 00:43:14,481
You have to do it all yourself, your way.

600
00:43:14,482 --> 00:43:17,535
you got me screw enough,
before I even got a chance to come true to you,.

601
00:43:17,536 --> 00:43:21,169
but, If you just let me do something for you,
I think ...

602
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,436
that, I will surpurised you.
i really do

603
00:43:24,312 --> 00:43:26,645
I know what's surpurising.

604
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,799
You think, I don't hear myself,
you think i like a total bitch?

605
00:43:37,738 --> 00:43:40,863
you know, Brad and Hailey are split now.
- I know.

606
00:43:40,964 --> 00:43:43,133
did you ever think about
leaving me?

607
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:45,102
No.

608
00:43:45,103 --> 00:43:48,076
really, you never fantasized about
leaving me for another man?

609
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:53,453
never, no, god. If anything, i fantasized sometimes about
being alone.

610
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:58,243
What's that mean?
- just, there a times ...

611
00:43:58,244 --> 00:44:01,432
when I just thought about,
of my worst day ...

612
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:06,366
just, leaving our house, just going someplace
like check in to a hotel ...

613
00:44:06,367 --> 00:44:12,050
and just being in a quiet room by myself
just sitting in a quite air conditioning room ...

614
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:16,160
sitting down, eating my lunch with no one
touching me ...

615
00:44:16,161 --> 00:44:18,742
drinking a diet sprite.

616
00:44:18,743 --> 00:44:21,773
by myself.
- Thats sound awful.

617
00:44:21,774 --> 00:44:26,257
look, I just wanna have one day that doesn't
depends on how everybody elses day goes .

618
00:44:26,258 --> 00:44:29,593
It's not that i have gross sex fantasy or something.

619
00:44:29,594 --> 00:44:32,106
That I would understand.
that make sense to me

620
00:44:32,107 --> 00:44:37,079
mean, everybody have gross sex fantasies.
i mean, obviously, yours with Holbrooke.

621
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,478
Mine with Cyndi Lauper.

622
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:43,935
Really? but present.
- Any time of day.

623
00:44:45,032 --> 00:44:47,946
What an interesting choice.

624
00:44:50,028 --> 00:44:54,642
Brad said to me that, he and Haley were fine

625
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:59,734
And they were just really excellent roommates.

626
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:04,034
it's not we are, isn't it?
- No.

627
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,764
Right?

628
00:45:16,986 --> 00:45:20,002
We should be going.

629
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:31,476
135 Avenue D. Here it is.

630
00:45:31,477 --> 00:45:33,974
alright, I park here.

631
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,757
They are not home.

632
00:45:44,758 --> 00:45:47,364
We'll wait.
-for how long, Phil?

633
00:45:47,365 --> 00:45:49,812
The cops from the Holbrooke
could be headed over here right now.

634
00:45:52,432 --> 00:45:55,483
okay, fourth floor.

635
00:45:55,484 --> 00:45:57,663
What are you doing?
- If we can't find the Tripplehorn ...

636
00:45:57,664 --> 00:46:00,769
maybe we can find their Flash Drive.
Come here.

637
00:46:05,443 --> 00:46:08,312
We can do this.
- one night I dressed up.

638
00:46:08,855 --> 00:46:11,457
here we go. Ready?
One, two, three, go!

639
00:46:12,222 --> 00:46:16,099
it's on you.

640
00:46:24,857 --> 00:46:26,930
Everything you doing, I'm doing in heels.

641
00:46:26,931 --> 00:46:29,674
I just want you to think about that.

642
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,873
They stamp a chicken nugget
with a sharpy.

643
00:46:55,874 --> 00:46:59,326
These are bad people.
Look over there, I look here.

644
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:12,507
Damn it, Phil.
-sshh. What?

645
00:47:12,508 --> 00:47:16,737
Why don't you ever close any drawers?
- I'm sorry.

646
00:47:16,772 --> 00:47:20,967
You never ever close any drawer
you ever opened.

647
00:47:28,464 --> 00:47:30,672
shh. Don't move.

648
00:47:31,465 --> 00:47:34,373
Who is there?
- okay, move now.

649
00:47:36,618 --> 00:47:39,641
This is not what you looks like.
- yeah, look at this bitch.

650
00:47:39,642 --> 00:47:42,381
oh, my neck.
- wait, stop. we can explain

651
00:47:42,477 --> 00:47:47,135
stop talking.
- What the hell are you doing here?

652
00:47:49,756 --> 00:47:53,814
Sit down.
move, you two.

653
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:57,128
Careful.

654
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,682
alright, you must be Thomas Felton?

655
00:48:01,683 --> 00:48:03,177
People call me 'Taste'.

656
00:48:03,904 --> 00:48:06,802
I bet people also call you
Tripplehorn.

657
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:11,919
I'm a big Jeanne Tripplehorn fan.
- Yes, she's a fine actress.

658
00:48:12,303 --> 00:48:13,654
Who is this?
- I'm Whippet.

659
00:48:13,655 --> 00:48:15,501
Whippet like, the dog?

660
00:48:15,502 --> 00:48:18,462
No, like when you sucks nitrus,
out of the whiped cream can.

661
00:48:20,402 --> 00:48:25,644
Stupid skink.
- oh my god, do you have any contact with your mother at all?

662
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:30,006
This is a nice peace.

663
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:33,039
hey, zip your face.

664
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,540
are you serious?
-yeah, he said "zip your face."

665
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:38,011
that's your best line?
that's your best tough guy line?

666
00:48:38,012 --> 00:48:41,436
You heard me, zip your face.
- why don't you zip your vagina, Raymond Burke.

667
00:48:41,437 --> 00:48:44,379
I have know idea how to respond to that.

668
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,112
'F' you.
- 'F' me, 'F' you.

669
00:48:47,113 --> 00:48:49,945
'F' you.
- 'F' you, man. What are you doing here?

670
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,668
'F' you, mother Fr.

671
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:58,786
okay, what do you want?
- You have no idea what you've done to us.

672
00:48:59,448 --> 00:49:01,198
What?

673
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:04,399
When you've miss your reservation at Claw
You've ruined our lives.

674
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,737
What are you talking about?
- We didn't miss anything, you dumbass.

675
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:12,826
We saw the two goongs
check the place out , so we took off.

676
00:49:12,827 --> 00:49:16,682
were you the reservation police or something?
- What is to you?

677
00:49:16,683 --> 00:49:19,552
We don't have the reservation,
So we have took yours.

678
00:49:19,553 --> 00:49:21,662
And now they think that we're you.

679
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:25,359
You just took our reservation?
Who does that?

680
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,445
What kind of people are you?

681
00:49:27,446 --> 00:49:31,786
Come on.
- How did you find us anyway?

682
00:49:31,787 --> 00:49:34,418
I stole your number from
the reservation list.

683
00:49:35,153 --> 00:49:37,688
That's smart.
- Thank you.

684
00:49:38,379 --> 00:49:41,725
you used our real number
to make that reservation?

685
00:49:41,726 --> 00:49:46,154
No, i don't use the home number,
i use the cell phone.

686
00:49:47,299 --> 00:49:52,082
oh, wow. that's brilliant.
wow, Taste. you're just a goddamn criminal mastermind.

687
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:56,821
So, this is about how I'm an asshole all the time, ha?
I have no trust that i can pull thing trough?

688
00:49:56,822 --> 00:49:58,854
Yeah.
- I can't do anything right?

689
00:49:58,855 --> 00:50:02,560
I buy the wrong soda,
the wrong beer ...

690
00:50:02,561 --> 00:50:04,440
I hear you, man.
- The wrong nipple clamps.

691
00:50:04,441 --> 00:50:06,894
Those clamps hurt me.

692
00:50:06,895 --> 00:50:09,554
And then you come home, you don't
even look at me.

693
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:12,621
I have to beg to sex with me.
like it's a gift.

694
00:50:12,622 --> 00:50:14,962
And forget the back door.

695
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,574
Forget that.
- we've forgotten.

696
00:50:17,575 --> 00:50:23,099
I am sorry, if I am a little tired,
after working all night.

697
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,570
to just come home, you jump on you,
and give you a free lapdance.

698
00:50:26,571 --> 00:50:31,210
i am sorry. I was practically very happy stripping
and tricking at the Hippo.

699
00:50:31,211 --> 00:50:33,927
It make me feel good about myself.

700
00:50:33,928 --> 00:50:38,997
I got a rippen.
and no, you have to go, get all greedy. ...

701
00:50:38,998 --> 00:50:41,701
and stealing everything from everyone.
- okay, that's enough.

702
00:50:41,702 --> 00:50:46,621
excuse me for dreaming. like I want to spend of
the rest of my life sell the stolen wheelchair.

703
00:50:46,656 --> 00:50:48,532
I think you're losing control.

704
00:50:48,533 --> 00:50:51,039
what about my dream? And what about me?
- Stop arguing.

705
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,491
Stop arguing. stop it.
shut, everybody shut the holes.

706
00:50:55,492 --> 00:50:57,530
shut the holes.
- Be quiet.

707
00:50:57,531 --> 00:51:01,166

they think we have a flash drive ...

708
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:02,871

so, you gonna go to them...

709
00:51:02,872 --> 00:51:05,197
and tell them that you are
The Tripplehorn.

710
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:09,713
Wait a second, bitch.
- Don't call me a bitch, whore.

711
00:51:09,714 --> 00:51:15,422
Are you telling me that this goongs are tracking you right now?
- Have you not heard a word I said, whore?

712
00:51:15,456 --> 00:51:18,650

You need to help us out of this.

713
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:20,644

714
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:24,489

Ready? go.

715

00:51:27,787 --> 00:51:29,908
Forget Latex.
Only the essential.

717
00:51:29,909 --> 00:51:32,170
Stop packing, nobody
is going anywhere.

718
00:51:32,171 --> 00:51:37,696
Stop. You are over packing.
- What are you doing?

719
00:51:37,792 --> 00:51:39,533
we must walk away in 30 seconds.

720
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:42,357
Bobby De Niro, a classic.

721
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:46,219
okay, no way. nobody is going anywhere.

722
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,775

728
00:52:04,517 --> 00:52:06,388
Come on.
- Wait.

729
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,976

This is our home.

730
00:52:09,977 --> 00:52:13,276
No, it's not.

731
00:52:13,277 --> 00:52:17,611

736
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:48,450
good night.

737
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:53,528
That's gone

750
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:12,410
I am sorry, just hold on.

751
00:54:12,411 --> 00:54:15,818
What are you doing?

00:54:23,508 --> 00:54:26,827
What are you doing?

We need to get you out of us.

754
00:54:28,526 --> 00:54:30,900
We gotta go quickly as possible, Phil.

755
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:43,157
That's not working.

You put your jerk in reverse.

761
00:55:39,185 --> 00:55:42,500
Take your foot off the brake.
- No.

762
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:54,192
Come on.

763
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:59,235

771
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:44,854
oh god, why did they wanna
kill us so badly?

772
00:56:44,855 --> 00:56:48,452
hey, do you have a computer or a BlackBerry?
something that can read the document

773
00:56:48,453 --> 00:56:50,795
I got a kindle.
- Give it.

774

And now, pull over

793
00:58:25,372 --> 00:58:26,934

- The brake doesn't work?

794
00:58:27,415 --> 00:58:28,470
The brakes are gone.

795
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,905

802
00:59:26,434 --> 00:59:29,057
The Tripplehorn are gone.

803
00:59:30,284 --> 00:59:32,780
We gotta nothing.

804
00:59:33,393 --> 00:59:37,677

a blanket or something in the car.

805
00:59:41,674 --> 00:59:44,409
alright, I am dying to hear
what the hell happen.

806
00:59:44,505 --> 00:59:48,250
Well, we're having some beer, okay
and then two people, that you let go...

807
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,251
walk into the bar.
The Fosters?

808
00:59:50,252 --> 00:59:53,740
The Fosters.
You have a good memory.

809
00:59:54,077 --> 00:59:58,054
they come in and next thing
i know they shooting at us.

810
00:59:58,055 --> 01:00:01,948
Mr. Foster? the tax lawyer
from New Jersey are now armed?

811
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:05,133
That,s odd..

812
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:07,944
that's extremely dangerous, what it is
so we took chased.

813
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:11,506
You know what, great work, fellas.
why don't you both go home.

814
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:14,608
If you want, we just stay here
and help you find them.

815
01:00:14,609 --> 01:00:16,384
good night.

816
01:00:16,564 --> 01:00:19,213
we've got you.
- Say your prayers.

817
01:00:29,621 --> 01:00:32,040
so, what was on that
computer sticky thing anyway?

818
01:00:32,169 --> 01:00:34,156
just some ledgers and pictures.

819
01:00:34,252 --> 01:00:36,572
Pictures of what?
- of services rendered.

820
01:00:36,573 --> 01:00:39,805
at one of Joe's Milletto clubs
that's call a Peppermint Hippo.

821
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:43,883
that don't even matter now, the computer
sticky thing is at the bottom of this river.

822
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,746
which is, we're will be
those cops catch up us.

823
01:00:46,747 --> 01:00:49,108
okay, walk me through this again ...

824
01:00:49,109 --> 01:00:51,233
Honey!
- If I'm gonna get whack off ...

825
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:53,830
at least, i'm deserved to understand
why its happening.

826
01:00:54,582 --> 01:00:58,685
What are you smiling about?
- no. you're very sweet, we're not going...

827
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:00,190
no, we're not going to get whack off.
- I think we are.

828
01:01:00,191 --> 01:01:02,443
I don't think we are.

829
01:01:02,697 --> 01:01:09,181
The thing is, this ledger had only
pictures and information about one client.

830
01:01:09,216 --> 01:01:12,900
DA, Crenshaw.
- The guy with the broom?

831
01:01:13,272 --> 01:01:16,044
The Tripplehorn, they may have
stolen the Flash Drive from Miletto  ...

832
01:01:16,045 --> 01:01:17,985
they were blackmailing the DA.

833
01:01:17,986 --> 01:01:21,508
which is why, Taste acted weird
when you brought up Miletto's name.

834
01:01:22,487 --> 01:01:25,883
oh, Phil. I so got this.
but, something to do with Crenshaw?

835
01:01:26,973 --> 01:01:28,963
yes honey, it is everything to do with
Crenshaw...

836
01:01:28,964 --> 01:01:31,832
that's the key. we have to
find the way to get to Crenshaw.

837
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:34,819
well, the Tripplehorn got him
at the Peppermint Hippo.

838
01:01:36,565 --> 01:01:38,758
And we are Tripplehorn

839
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,225
hell, yes. we are.

840
01:01:44,385 --> 01:01:48,468
We gonna need some help.
- oh, wax off, of god.

841
01:01:55,053 --> 01:01:57,452
Is that my tracksuit?

842
01:01:57,703 --> 01:02:00,308
Yes, it was in the trunk of your Audi ...

843
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:02,626
which is now parked over by the
East River ...

844
01:02:02,627 --> 01:02:05,878
and probably he need a significant repair...

845
01:02:05,879 --> 01:02:09,755
for which i'm sure i'll be able to
pay you back over the next several decades...

846
01:02:09,756 --> 01:02:15,052
also on my cab, i would like to add that super old gun
that i stole from your hall way...

847
01:02:15,053 --> 01:02:17,644
which incidently is never useful.

848
01:02:17,645 --> 01:02:21,363
He just run popped ..
- But thats not the reason we're here.

849
01:02:21,364 --> 01:02:24,089
as impossible as this maybe to believe...

850
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:28,852
Holbrooke, our night has actually
gotten weirder since we saw you last ...

851
01:02:28,853 --> 01:02:33,588
There were cars, then we were hook in.
one of those yours cars, anyway ...

852
01:02:33,589 --> 01:02:36,651
I have an interesting night myself
and I am really tired, so ...

853
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:40,492
and its nice and worst to see you again, Claire
i put you to took a knock to somebody else's door.

854
01:02:42,002 --> 01:02:46,212
no. here's a thing.
I just wanted to take my wife to dinner tonight ...

855
01:02:46,213 --> 01:02:54,404
I was just hoping that we would have one night
where we could, you know, feel like new ...

856
01:02:54,405 --> 01:02:57,264
but now all I wanna do is getting home.

857
01:02:58,054 --> 01:03:01,142
and, i've got a plan
i've got a way to do that ...

858
01:03:01,143 --> 01:03:03,936
i'm not very good with plans generally
but I got one ...

859
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:06,489
and I need help.

860
01:03:06,894 --> 01:03:09,232
even though you packs
make me wanna kill myself ...

861
01:03:09,233 --> 01:03:13,058
and your girlfriend is so hot, its like looking
through a jet engines ...

862
01:03:13,252 --> 01:03:17,228
I know and believe that
there a real person ...

863
01:03:17,229 --> 01:03:20,590
that understands exactly
what i'm going through right now.

864
01:03:20,591 --> 01:03:26,109
So please, Holbrooke,
just let us come in?

865
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:30,259

866
01:03:31,268 --> 01:03:37,353

and tell him that his spell boy maybe late

875
01:04:41,562 --> 01:04:43,834
I don't really have gum.

876
01:04:45,015 --> 01:04:48,044
The locker room is on the left.
- Come on, pimp.

877
01:04:59,616 --> 01:05:02,041
Wait here.

882
01:05:32,352 --> 01:05:34,189
You look awsome.

883
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:37,191
Why it is so bright out here,

884
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:40,174

885
01:05:41,398 --> 01:05:44,442

- I had to put it in backward ...

886
01:05:44,443 --> 01:05:47,078
and spin it.
I think I lost the nipple.

887
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:49,974
No, you look great.

888
01:05:50,354 --> 01:05:52,295
yeah, for reals.

889
01:05:52,391 --> 01:05:54,559
This is the only one long enough
to cover my caesarean scar.

890
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:57,704
I cannot stop looking at your boobs.

891
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,621

943
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:36,055

any more minutes we can count of money.

944
01:11:36,056 --> 01:11:38,670
How about one with
a Flash Drive?

945
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:43,008
How are you doing?
We are the Tripplehorn.

946
01:11:46,794 --> 01:11:48,508
oh, they just keep showing up.

947
01:11:48,509 --> 01:11:51,997
Why don't we take a walk
and talk about things.

948
01:11:52,732 --> 01:11:54,869
in privately.

949
01:11:54,903 --> 01:11:57,826
This is gonna be so good.

950
01:12:06,665 --> 01:12:08,500
This is part of the plan right?

951
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:11,362
I gotta go back to subway
for a refresher.

952
01:12:15,002 --> 01:12:16,301
okay, let's make this simple, okay ...

953
01:12:16,302 --> 01:12:20,422
you give me the Flash Drive
or Collins is gonna breaks both your wife arms.

954
01:12:20,832 --> 01:12:23,979
I put the flash drive someplace that no one
is ever gonna find it ...

955
01:12:24,075 --> 01:12:28,243
part of it, Mr. Holbrooke Grant hear from us
every hour until hour, until we are safe ...

956
01:12:28,244 --> 01:12:30,908
then he will release content of that
drive.

957
01:12:33,498 --> 01:12:35,949
He is the ex-military
that we have questioned tonight ...

958
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:38,321
Holbrooke Grant.

959
01:12:38,343 --> 01:12:40,448
What's the hell going on up here?

960
01:12:40,449 --> 01:12:44,576
excuse me sir, we're trying to do a roof club thing
if you just give a minute.

961
01:12:44,577 --> 01:12:48,398

This is my roof, toptouch.

962
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:51,776

963
01:12:51,777 --> 01:12:54,442

964
01:12:54,443 --> 01:12:55,825
They were just about to
leave, Joe ...

965
01:12:55,826 --> 01:12:58,697
you know, the guy that have said
that he have flash drive. theres no play here

966
01:12:58,698 --> 01:13:00,095
Have you seen the flash drive?

967
01:13:00,096 --> 01:13:04,043
oh, don't worry though,
We won't say a word about the pictures.

968
01:13:04,044 --> 01:13:06,587
just, shut your mouth.
- What pictures?

969
01:13:06,683 --> 01:13:08,107
Nothing.
-he doesn't know?

970
01:13:08,108 --> 01:13:12,747

- oh, wow. i'm gonna pull over here.

971
01:13:12,748 --> 01:13:16,908
Sorry, but I get it, i'm totally know why
you have pornographic pictures of the DA ...

972
01:13:16,909 --> 01:13:18,350

what gonna coming in handy?.

973
01:13:18,351 --> 01:13:22,053
just zip it, Skippy.
- you zip your vagina.

974
01:13:23,427 --> 01:13:26,476
No, its okay. when he says vagina,
he means your face.

975
01:13:26,477 --> 01:13:29,307
You said it what is on that Drive
was the city contracts ...

976
01:13:29,308 --> 01:13:34,523

All this time, I've been keeping the cops of your ass...

977
01:13:34,524 --> 01:13:38,465
and your stashing dirty picture of me?
- Very dirty, gross pictures.

978
01:13:38,561 --> 01:13:42,819
You'll be in jail for what you done for me
So watch your tone, Mr. DA.

979
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:46,177
looks like you guys have something to resolve
So, my wife and I will be going.

980
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:50,507
no. no one is moving, so it will be a lot of
easier if someone in here.

981
01:13:50,508 --> 01:13:53,140
Phil, turn the gun like we see in "The Kill Shot".

982
01:13:53,141 --> 01:13:55,914
Put the gun down!
- Come on, cops.

983
01:13:55,915 --> 01:14:01,674
It's gonna be okay.
- no, this is not okay. this is a bad plan.

984
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:04,959
shoot.
- they will be shooting everybody.

985
01:14:05,055 --> 01:14:06,729
Claire, look at me ...

986
01:14:06,730 --> 01:14:09,898
look at me!
I got this...

987
01:14:09,994 --> 01:14:13,527
I have got this.

988
01:14:18,273 --> 01:14:20,101
Count to three.
- What?

989
01:14:20,102 --> 01:14:24,615
Just count it down.
- No, that doesn't work with grown ups.
thats doesn't work with people with gun

990
01:14:24,666 --> 01:14:27,188
Trust me.

991
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:33,555
alright, I have had enough ...

992
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:38,176
my kids gonna had me in 90 minutes
so this shit ends now ...

993
01:14:38,844 --> 01:14:44,037
I'm gonna count into three and everyone of you boys
is gonna put down your guns.

994
01:14:44,038 --> 01:14:45,587
Does she serious?

995
01:14:45,683 --> 01:14:47,566
one.
- I think she serious.

996
01:14:47,601 --> 01:14:49,449
Two.
- it's just kidding, right?

997
01:14:51,284 --> 01:14:53,548
Three.

998
01:14:54,527 --> 01:14:58,039
This is the NYPD, put down your weapons
put your hands in the air.

999
01:15:03,409 --> 01:15:05,877
put down your weapons
and hands in the air.

1000
01:15:06,393 --> 01:15:08,782
I'm a cop.
- No, not anymore, you're not

1001
01:15:08,783 --> 01:15:11,639
I told you I could surprise you.

1002
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:16,691
good to see you again, Detective.

1003
01:15:16,692 --> 01:15:19,456
You too Mr. Foster.
- This was part of the plan?

1004
01:15:19,457 --> 01:15:22,737
The helicopter and the SWAT team
are all part of the plan?

1005
01:15:22,738 --> 01:15:26,294
he had your friend, Holbrooke called me, said to
be here 5.30 ...

1006
01:15:26,329 --> 01:15:28,496
you have something for me?
- Yes, i do.

1007
01:15:29,777 --> 01:15:35,784
I think there is enough evidence
of this wire to put those two away for quite some time.

1008
01:15:35,785 --> 01:15:37,637
Thank you.

1009
01:15:40,698 --> 01:15:43,679
Mr. Miletto, Mr. DA ...

1010
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,353
you two are under arrest,
for obstruction of justice ...

1011
01:15:46,354 --> 01:15:50,056
extortion, conspiracy and I'm pretty
sure prostitution.

1012
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:52,787
get them out of here.

1013
01:15:54,929 --> 01:15:56,316
so, you two need a ride?

1014
01:15:56,317 --> 01:15:59,235
Yes please, our kids must
be freaking out.

1015
01:15:59,236 --> 01:16:03,246
No, we've sent SWAT out there,
they are fast asleep with the sitter.

1016
01:16:03,579 --> 01:16:05,346
Thank God.

1017
01:16:05,801 --> 01:16:08,215
What is your story?

1018
01:16:11,711 --> 01:16:14,747
Just a boring married couple from
New Jersey.

1019
01:16:15,588 --> 01:16:17,193
So how about that ride.

1020
01:16:17,194 --> 01:16:21,543
actually, i promised my wife
to have dinner in the city.

1021
01:16:32,684 --> 01:16:36,525
I'm not sure but I think this
the best pancake I've ever had in mylife.

1022
01:16:38,661 --> 01:16:41,050
How did even begin to come up with the whole plan?

1023
01:16:42,273 --> 01:16:44,702
It's like that book
from the book club ...

1024
01:16:44,703 --> 01:16:48,608
Nasrin makes her brother and
stepfather to fighting each other ...

1025
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:51,408
so she can flee the town through out
the desert ...

1026
01:16:51,504 --> 01:16:53,112
and menstruate in peace.

1027
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:58,089
What?
- You read it? you read the book?

1028
01:16:58,122 --> 01:17:00,648
Of course. I read all of them

1029
01:17:00,672 --> 01:17:03,688
Why?
- Because it's matter to you.

1030
01:17:06,008 --> 01:17:09,839
I only read the first 30 pages
and the last page.

1031
01:17:10,438 --> 01:17:14,478
Who has time to read. I don't
like those book.

1032
01:17:21,248 --> 01:17:24,282
What? do i have something?
-no

1033
01:17:28,759 --> 01:17:30,560
I'll do it again, you know.

1034
01:17:30,561 --> 01:17:33,587
what, tonight, no,
it was very dangerous.

1035
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:39,125
no, not tonight.us.
You and me, the kids, all of them.

1036
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:41,950
I'll do it again.

1037
01:17:45,763 --> 01:17:49,544
I choose you, every time.
