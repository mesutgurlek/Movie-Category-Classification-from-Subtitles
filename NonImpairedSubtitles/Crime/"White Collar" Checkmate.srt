1
00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:02,109
Previously on White Collar...

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,640
To our best and final score.

3
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:06,605
You almost killed me, Mozzie.

4
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:07,546
What do you want, Keller?

5
00:00:07,547 --> 00:00:09,568
This is your last chance to
cut me in on your treasure.

6
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:10,832
Remember, I did ask nicely.

7
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,664
Now I'm gonna have to make
you give me what I want.

8
00:00:12,665 --> 00:00:14,797
Neal, it's time for you to make a choice.

9
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:16,050
Do you want to leave?

10
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:16,751
No.

11
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:18,168
You're fooling yourself

12
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:19,949
if you think this is who you really are.

13
00:00:20,972 --> 00:00:22,256
I've seen the treasure.

14
00:00:22,384 --> 00:00:23,993
Yeah, your boy Caffrey's got it.

15
00:00:24,171 --> 00:00:25,253
And you want it.

16
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:26,510
You gonna help me or what?

17
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:27,675
Why would I help you?

18
00:00:27,838 --> 00:00:29,016
How about you go home

19
00:00:29,093 --> 00:00:30,855
and relax and think about it?

20
00:00:31,785 --> 00:00:32,721
Peter.

21
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:35,891
He took my wife.

22
00:00:43,854 --> 00:00:44,963
Peter...

23
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,250
SWAT's been deployed throughout New York,

24
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:48,737
and HRTt's on standby.

25
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:51,399
We've got aerial, ground, marine,
electronic surveillance

26
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,035
all up.

27
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:53,718
Checkpoints are everywhere.

28
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,943
We'll find her, Peter.

29
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:57,116
Do we know what Keller wants?

30
00:00:58,818 --> 00:00:59,761
Neal.

31
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:10,363
You have the treasure.

32
00:01:10,378 --> 00:01:12,172
I didn't steal it, okay?
You son of a bitch!

33
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:13,915
I don't care. You have it.

34
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:15,026
Keller knows.

35
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:16,385
You're gonna give it to him

36
00:01:16,386 --> 00:01:18,072
so that I can get my wife back.

37
00:01:18,073 --> 00:01:19,378
Yes. Whatever you need.
Mm-hmm.

38
00:01:23,237 --> 00:01:24,237
It's him.

39
00:01:24,924 --> 00:01:25,845
Agent Burke.

40
00:01:25,846 --> 00:01:28,128
If you're smart -- and
we both know you are --

41
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,011
you'll keep the FBI off this call.

42
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:31,319
I am FBI.

43
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,328
No. Now you're just a man
who wants his wife back.

44
00:01:34,724 --> 00:01:35,798
Let me talk to her.

45
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,512
And why would I let you do that?

46
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:38,915
I want to hear her voice.

47
00:01:41,962 --> 00:01:43,432
Be careful, Mrs. Burke.

48
00:01:43,624 --> 00:01:45,272
No passing messages, okay?

49
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:49,513
Hi, hon.

50
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:52,564
Hi, hon.

51
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:53,852
You all right?

52
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:55,656
Yeah, I-I'm okay.

53
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,636
They haven't hurt me.

54
00:01:57,637 --> 00:01:58,635
I miss you.

55
00:02:00,022 --> 00:02:01,224
I miss you, too.

56
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:04,326
Will you make sure Satchmo's okay?

57
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:05,904
You know how is if he hasn't eaten.

58
00:02:05,905 --> 00:02:07,318
Hey. Talk time's over.

59
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:08,788
I'll fix this, El.

60
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:10,030
El?

61
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:13,052
You two kids are tugging
on my heartstrings here.

62
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:14,756
So nice to see a married couple

63
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:16,463
showing love after all this time.

64
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:17,885
I'd hate to come between that.

65
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:19,510
So let her go. 
I will.

66
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:21,111
As soon as you hold up your end of it.

67
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,520
The moment I have Caffrey's
treasure, she's all yours.

68
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:24,780
You have 12 hours.

69
00:02:28,646 --> 00:02:29,670
What'd she say?

70
00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:31,295
She could have said anything,

71
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:33,875
and she asked me about Satchmo.

72
00:02:37,773 --> 00:02:39,250
He looks fine.
I know.

73
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,785
Think she was passing a code?

74
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,147
Oh, there is it.

75
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,364
Oh, I love my wife.
Right.

76
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:46,843
Good boy, Satchmo.

77
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:47,915
Jones!

78
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:48,926
Good boy.

79
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:50,228
Yeah?

80
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:52,328
Satchmo bit one of our kidnappers.

81
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:54,140
There's blood under Satchmo's chin.

82
00:02:54,183 --> 00:02:56,536
Okay, we'll get a blood
kit and run a DNA test.

83
00:02:56,537 --> 00:02:58,066
Put word out to pharmacies and hospitals

84
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:00,036
to keep an eye out for
anybody with a dog bite.

85
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:01,286
Thanks.
All right.

86
00:03:03,544 --> 00:03:04,497
Let's go, boy.

87
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:09,037
Take me to the treasure.

88
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:18,163
You're not gonna tell the
bureau about Keller?

89
00:03:18,586 --> 00:03:19,417
Not yet.

90
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:21,709
He knows our playbook better than we do.

91
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:24,796
Let Jones and Diana focus
on finding Elizabeth.

92
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:25,969
We'll deal with Keller.

93
00:03:29,061 --> 00:03:31,600
I drive past this building every morning.

94
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:33,655
The treasure's in here?

95
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:36,015
I didn't ask for it.

96
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:37,577
You could have walked away.

97
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:38,803
You're right. I could have.

98
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:40,716
I didn't.

99
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:44,664
And I should be paying
for it, not Elizabeth.

100
00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:47,226
You're going to pay for it. Right now.

101
00:03:58,256 --> 00:03:59,213
Where is it?

102
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:00,630
It was here.

103
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:04,063
Peter, it was all here.

104
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:05,185
Oh, God.

105
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,065
He already moved it.

106
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,116
Who's "he"? He? Mozzie?

107
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,198
Of course it was Mozzie.
You call him.

108
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,252
I tried.

109
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:17,908
Look, he's not talking to me.
We had a falling out.

110
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:19,887
What, you couldn't agree
on what island to buy?

111
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,986
I didn't think he'd move it this fast.

112
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:26,304
Where'd he take it?

113
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:27,370
I don't know.

114
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:29,386
I don't.

115
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:31,780
It's Elizabeth. No lies.
I don't know.

116
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:34,667
Damn it, Neal!

117
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:40,965
Mozzie could be anywhere in the world.

118
00:04:41,268 --> 00:04:43,543
We have less than 12 hours
to find him. Peter.

119
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:46,582
We're gonna get her back.

120
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,238
And we start by finding Mozzie.

121

122
00:05:13,486 --> 00:05:14,877
Any luck in finding Mozzie?

123
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:17,358
No. He's gone completely to ground.

124
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,537
He's canceled his emails, his cellphones.

125
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:21,348
You find anything?

126
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:22,973
Nope. His safe houses are abandoned.

127
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:24,091
Monday through Sunday?

128
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:25,289
Empty.

129
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:27,006
He probably left the city.

130
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:37,386
What were you two arguing about?

131
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:40,417
Mozzie wanted to leave New York.

132
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:42,899
I didn't.

133
00:05:43,806 --> 00:05:44,782
Why not?

134
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:47,065
You.

135
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:49,388
Elizabeth.

136
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:51,434
Sara.

137
00:05:53,016 --> 00:05:54,466
The view out that window.

138
00:05:54,752 --> 00:05:56,480
Stepping off the elevator Monday morning.

139
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,704
All of it.

140
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:01,325
I have a life here.

141
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:05,714
What about Mozzie?

142
00:06:06,593 --> 00:06:08,788
Well, he didn't like to
admit it, but, yeah...

143
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:10,495
This is his home.

144
00:06:12,187 --> 00:06:14,392
I ran every alias you gave me.

145
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:17,150
He hasn't boarded a plane or a boat.

146
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:18,449
That means he's thinking it over.

147
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,522
Where?

148
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:21,042
He wants seclusion.

149
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,856
There's got to be a way to reach him.
There is.

150
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,164
One way.

151
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:33,469
I'm looking for Estelle.

152
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:36,055
Strange place to find a
woman, don't you think?

153
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:39,526
She's not a woman, but
you already know that.

154
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:41,292
All right. Who are you?

155
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:42,970
Friend of Mozzie's.

156
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:45,128
I need to get a message to him.

157
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:48,053
Blue eyes. Tailored suit.

158
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:49,744
He told me you might come.

159
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:51,720
He said to send you away.

160
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,246
Cher Ami.

161
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:57,693
During World War I,

162
00:06:57,694 --> 00:06:59,060
the lost battalion was surrounded

163
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:01,184
by German soldiers in
the Battle of Argonne.

164
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:03,556
Every carrier pigeon they
sent out for help was killed.

165
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:05,314
Cher Ami was their last one.

166
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:07,408
The lost battalion watched
him get shot down.

167
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:09,404
All hope was lost.

168
00:07:10,294 --> 00:07:10,825
But somehow,

169
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:12,831
he took flight again and
reached his destination.

170
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:14,871
Saved 200 lives

171
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:17,200
and was awarded the Croix de Guerre.

172
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:19,329
Cher Ami means "dear friend."

173
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,967
Mozzie's dear friend needs him now.

174
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,910
He doesn't know it,

175
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:26,005
but another life needs to be saved.

176
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,700
Hey, Estelle.

177
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,670
It's been a long time.

178
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:42,693
I never knew where you flew
to, but I think I do now.

179
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:46,888
Mozzie always said

180
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:48,437
you were the best homer in the city.

181
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,775
We need you.

182
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,832
Morning.

183
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:05,309
Thought you could use a fresh cup.

184
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:06,430
Thanks, Jones.

185
00:08:06,803 --> 00:08:09,161
DNA results came back on
the blood from Satchmo.

186
00:08:09,397 --> 00:08:10,479
It wasn't Keller's.

187
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:13,513
Leonard Grant.

188
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,139
Grant has a history of
unpredictable violence.

189
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,688
He has a long rap sheet,
including kidnapping.

190
00:08:18,893 --> 00:08:20,801
Looks like the kind of
guy Keller would love.

191
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:21,620
Exactly.

192
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:23,130
We're looking into his former contacts now,

193
00:08:23,131 --> 00:08:24,542
tracing his financial history.

194
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:25,763
Good.

195
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:31,803
Boss, is there anything I can do for you?

196
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:35,037
Oh... exactly what you're doing.

197
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:37,419
There isn't anyone I trust more

198
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,704
to spearhead this than you and Jones.

199
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:40,999
What about Caffrey?

200
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:43,668
He has the treasure, doesn't he?

201
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:46,495
That's what Keller's after, and
you're working that angle.

202
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,730
The less you know, the better right now.

203
00:08:49,606 --> 00:08:50,758
Thanks, Diana.

204
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:52,011
Okay.

205
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,198
Oh, Estelle. You're early.

206
00:09:34,963 --> 00:09:36,916
Please... don't hurt me.

207
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:38,390
T-they'll give you what you want.

208
00:09:39,294 --> 00:09:40,255
They better,

209
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:42,192
'cause I got lots of debts to pay...

210
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,878
Especially to the Russians,

211
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:46,346
so hopefully this will clear them all

212
00:09:46,347 --> 00:09:47,704
in one fell swoop.

213
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,237
Besides, the art doesn't
belong to Neal anyway.

214
00:09:50,475 --> 00:09:52,576
He's just the most recent
person to steal it.

215
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:54,488
I'm glad you're taking it.

216
00:09:54,489 --> 00:09:55,521
You are, huh?

217
00:09:56,677 --> 00:09:57,800
Why do you say that?

218
00:09:57,801 --> 00:10:00,380
Neal betrayed my husband, lied to him.

219
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,053
He doesn't deserve any of it.

220
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:05,504
Wow, you're good, Mrs. B.

221
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:06,481
I'll give you that.

222
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:10,845
No eye contact, identifying
with your captor.

223
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:12,161
I mean, you haven't even used my name.

224
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:15,128
Everything from the FBI
kidnapping playbook, huh?

225
00:10:15,221 --> 00:10:16,338
The only problem is...

226
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:19,104
your husband already knows who I am.

227
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,401
That's true.

228
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:27,650
And he and Neal are going to kick your ass.

229
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:31,445
Well, listen, I'm sure
you're trying to figure out

230
00:10:31,446 --> 00:10:33,096
how to escape from here,

231
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:34,918
so let me make this nice and easy.

232
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,898
This door is your only way in and out.

233
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,861
Not even Neal could pick this lock.

234
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:41,932
If I were you,

235
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:46,449
my second choice would be
this here fire escape.

236
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:53,318
So unless you have a drill
kit hidden in your blouse,

237
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,726
this is where you're staying.

238
00:10:56,124 --> 00:10:57,338
But just to make sure --

239
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,528
Hey, Grant!

240
00:11:01,347 --> 00:11:02,839
I believe you two met earlier, right?

241
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:04,825
I'd shake your hand, but...

242
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:06,629
So while I'm out meeting your husband,

243
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,193
Grant here will be keeping an eye on you.

244
00:11:10,806 --> 00:11:12,429
How long you gonna be gone? 
What?

245
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,227
My hand is really starting to hurt.

246
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:15,190
It's a scratch.

247
00:11:22,823 --> 00:11:24,238
Goodbye, Elizabeth Burke.

248
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:29,377
Shoot her in the foot
if she tries anything.

249
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,494
I want to be prepared if
we can't find Mozzie.

250
00:11:44,018 --> 00:11:45,584
What if we tell Keller the truth?

251
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:49,087
And he'll take it out on Elizabeth.

252
00:11:49,812 --> 00:11:52,122
Maybe we should let the FBI
know what Keller wants.

253
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:54,024
They won't negotiate with kidnappers,

254
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:56,682
and I want them focusing on finding El.

255
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,499
Well, we don't have to worry
about finding Mozzie.

256
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:03,900
Let's get him up here now.

257
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,712
For once, words fail me.

258
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:14,535
They can't possibly convey how sorry I am.

259
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:16,806
This was Keller's big move.
I should have seen this coming.

260
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:17,767
Do you have the treasure?

261
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:18,397
Yep.

262
00:12:18,398 --> 00:12:19,578
Good.

263
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:21,780
Wait! Y-you can't give it to him.

264
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:23,972
No, no. Once he has it,
there's no reason --

265
00:12:23,973 --> 00:12:24,597
Once he has it,

266
00:12:24,598 --> 00:12:25,874
there's no reason to keep her alive!

267
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,617
He didn't even hesitate to kill Hale.

268
00:12:27,618 --> 00:12:29,010
He's right, okay?

269
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:31,081
But now we have the treasure
as a bargaining chip.

270
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:32,676
El's only chance,

271
00:12:32,677 --> 00:12:35,198
my only guarantee that she'll be safe

272
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,786
is if the FBI finds her.

273
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:38,008
We're running out of time, Peter.

274
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:39,322
We need to buy more time.

275
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:41,718
Yeah, but Keller's smart
enough to read a stall.

276
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:43,927
Then the three of us have
to be smarter than him.

277
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:45,543
We've been playing by Keller's rules.

278
00:12:47,154 --> 00:12:48,448
Let's change the game.

279
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,994
Thought you'd be sipping Mai
Tais on a beach by now.

280
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:00,813
After all that happened,

281
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,864
I thought some introspection was in order.

282
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:05,672
I decided to follow in the
footsteps of Thoreau.

283
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:08,038
Found yourself a nice pond
and lived off the land?

284
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,977
Admit it. It's a hard city to leave.

285
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:12,991
She's a stubborn mistress.

286
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,832
Go through Grant's accounts.

287
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:18,953
Look for anything that may be a safe house.

288
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:21,271
This is my fault.
No, it's mine.

289
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:23,559
I was the one who took the
treasure in the first place.

290
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,439
Keller kidnapped Elizabeth. 
You didn't.

291
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:26,416
Remember that.

292
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:28,530
What'd the FBI say?

293
00:13:28,531 --> 00:13:30,708
They have a lead, but they need more time.

294
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,266
We can't stall the exchange.

295
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,572
Peter, if we do, there's no telling

296
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:36,113
what Keller would do to Elizabeth.

297
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,917
Where are you keeping the treasure?

298
00:13:40,664 --> 00:13:43,551
It's in a secure facility I
set up with some associates.

299
00:13:44,062 --> 00:13:45,646
What if we stalled Keller

300
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:46,918
without appearing to stall him?

301
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,601
Well, it'd have to be
something out of our control.

302
00:13:48,602 --> 00:13:49,958
Keller's not an easy one to con.

303
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:52,327
Yeah, he'd have to think we
were operating in good faith.

304
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:55,615
We're gonna have to show him the treasure.

305
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,647
I have an idea.

306
00:13:58,223 --> 00:14:00,616
We'll need a well-timed call to the police

307
00:14:00,617 --> 00:14:03,030
and a criminal we have
no concrete ties to --

308
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:04,842
someone you wouldn't mind ratting out.

309
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:07,944
I know just the rat.

310
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:17,151
Mozzie, I must say,

311
00:14:17,152 --> 00:14:18,527
after what happened in Atlanta,

312
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:19,997
I'm surprised to hear from you.

313
00:14:19,998 --> 00:14:22,656
Yeah, well, desperation makes
for strange bedfellows.

314
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,063
Um, can I talk to you without your shadow?

315
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:26,308
Simon.

316
00:14:27,776 --> 00:14:29,846
Look, I have a two-man job
that needs to be done today.

317
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:32,323
I need someone who can
crack the best security.

318
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:33,480
What is the job?

319
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,277
It's a benefactor-specified target.

320
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:38,143
I just picked up the
package on the way here.

321
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,842
Wait a minute.
So you haven't actually opened it?

322
00:14:39,843 --> 00:14:40,822
No, I was running late --

323
00:14:40,823 --> 00:14:43,152
So you don't actually know what the job is?

324
00:14:43,153 --> 00:14:44,695
I'm sure everything's in here.

325
00:14:45,021 --> 00:14:46,468
I've worked for this guy before.

326
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:47,497
He's legit.

327
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:49,040
I believe you.

328
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:52,561
Oh, come on, Rufus.

329
00:14:52,562 --> 00:14:54,939
We both have a chance to
make some serious cash here.

330
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,118
Well, since you actually
don't know what the job is,

331
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,527
I guess that I'm gonna be the one

332
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,267
making the serious scratch, and Simon, too.

333
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:03,454
Thanks for your help, mate.

334
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:05,157
Damn you, Rufus!

335
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:20,049
How's your heart rate?

336
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:21,887
What?

337
00:15:23,117 --> 00:15:26,208
If it's infected, your
heart rate will increase.

338
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:27,321
It's a scratch.

339
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:29,501
Mm. You're right.

340
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:30,419
I'm sure you're fine.

341
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:31,673
Unless you start sweating.

342
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:35,577
And if that happens?

343
00:15:37,517 --> 00:15:38,115
Well,

344
00:15:38,824 --> 00:15:40,306
it's probably blood poisoning.

345
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,705
Very common in dog bites.

346
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:42,887
But you don't have to believe me.

347
00:15:43,397 --> 00:15:44,423
You can look it up on your phone.

348
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:52,921
You picturing yourself
shooting Keller right now?

349
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:55,207
No. I don't want to shoot him.

350
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,115
I want to smash in his face repeatedly.

351
00:15:58,206 --> 00:16:00,881
I'm currently sticking bamboo
under his fingernails.

352
00:16:01,321 --> 00:16:02,718
You are one for the classics.

353
00:16:03,275 --> 00:16:04,426
You guys talking about me?

354
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,887
'Cause my ears are burning.

355
00:16:07,612 --> 00:16:08,862
My wife better be safe

356
00:16:08,992 --> 00:16:10,352
I like to see the passion, Burke.

357
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:11,640
It shows me you're motivated.

358
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:12,565
Look, she's fine.

359
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,808
As long as I call in every half hour,

360
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:15,734
she'll stay that way.

361
00:16:15,904 --> 00:16:17,093
Is your dog off his leash?

362
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:19,781
No anklet.

363
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:20,965
Good boy.

364
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:23,415
So the treasure's here?

365
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:24,801
It don't look like much, Mozzie.

366
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,340
That's precisely the point.

367
00:16:35,673 --> 00:16:36,481
What is this place?

368
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:40,149
It's a storage space for
honorable thieves --

369
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,733
the kind who wouldn't
steal from other thieves.

370
00:16:43,173 --> 00:16:44,392
No such thing, sweetheart.

371
00:16:45,745 --> 00:16:47,350
Must have been hard for you, Caffrey, huh?

372
00:16:47,978 --> 00:16:48,884
Lying to your friend's face

373
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:50,526
about having the treasure all this time?

374
00:16:50,822 --> 00:16:52,727
We can do this without the commentary.

375
00:16:53,107 --> 00:16:54,143
You've always been good

376
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:55,742
at lying to those closest to you.

377
00:16:56,357 --> 00:16:57,096
Right, Moz?

378
00:16:58,513 --> 00:16:59,842
Welcome to container 10...

379
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:01,266
Sweetheart.

380
00:17:04,863 --> 00:17:05,571
This is it.

381
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:08,874
The score of a lifetime.

382
00:17:23,353 --> 00:17:24,517
What do we have here?

383
00:17:25,151 --> 00:17:27,330
Hey, Napoleon brought that back
from his Egypt expedition.

384
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:28,604
It was in his private collection.

385
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,043
Yeah?

386
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:31,715
Now it's in mine.

387
00:17:32,894 --> 00:17:33,976
I mean, all this time, Caffrey,

388
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,643
you haven't been able to see it in person,

389
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:38,246
and now you're gonna have
to watch me take it away.

390
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,043
Cops? Are you kidding me?

391
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:43,010
You think I was bluffing, Burke?

392
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:44,073
No.

393
00:17:44,805 --> 00:17:47,195
Your wife is dead in five minutes
if I don't make that call.

394
00:17:47,326 --> 00:17:48,503
And I'm not gonna be able to do that

395
00:17:48,504 --> 00:17:49,567
with cuffs around my wrists.

396
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,757
This wasn't us, Keller.

397
00:17:50,947 --> 00:17:52,297
Well, we can't get caught here. Let's go.

398
00:17:57,737 --> 00:17:59,488
Police! All right, buddy, go ahead.

399
00:18:01,054 --> 00:18:02,033
There should be two in the back!

400
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:05,937
You two, freeze!

401
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:08,043
Hey, come on. Come on. Hands off!

402
00:18:08,475 --> 00:18:10,639
We found these guys breaking
into this shipping container.

403
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,427
Officer, we weren't breaking in.

404
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:14,415
Not at all. We own this.

405
00:18:14,643 --> 00:18:16,087
Do you also own the printing press

406
00:18:16,088 --> 00:18:17,315
and the counterfeit $20s inside?

407
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:19,032
He owns it. 
I've never seen it.

408
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:20,367
You dragged me into this. 
All right.

409
00:18:20,368 --> 00:18:21,333
Shut up!

410
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:24,838
I think we should check out
the rest of the containers.

411
00:18:28,794 --> 00:18:29,657
I'll get you.

412
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,534
You guys did this.

413
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:38,317
You think I would play games

414
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,850
with my wife's life on the line?

415
00:18:40,014 --> 00:18:40,968
This wasn't us.

416
00:18:41,794 --> 00:18:44,497
So, what, this is just
some random misfortune?

417
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:46,030
We made a deal, Keller.

418
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:48,939
You have the treasure, release my wife.

419
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:51,088
I don't have anything, Burke.

420
00:18:51,236 --> 00:18:52,016
The cops do.

421
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:53,823
They're setting up a perimeter,

422
00:18:53,824 --> 00:18:55,457
which means they'll open every container.

423
00:18:56,496 --> 00:18:58,845
Well, the police will need
warrants to get into them.

424
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,934
That should buy us some time.

425
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:02,782
For what?

426
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:07,439
The three of you do what
you do best -- steal it.

427
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,662
Not the three of us.

428
00:19:15,672 --> 00:19:16,471
The four of us.

429
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:19,184
I'm an FBI agent.

430
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:21,527
Today, you're one of us.

431
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:26,867
Boys, we're gonna steal
back our stolen treasure.

432
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:32,702
No beer.

433
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,510
Caffrey, you're a terrible host.

434
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:36,924
That's 'cause I don't want
you here to begin with.

435
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:37,935
Oh, I know.

436
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:40,624
Before I disappear with all
your ill-gotten goods,

437
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,065
I wanted to see where you've been holed up.

438
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,949
Man, oh, man, you've been slumming it.

439
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,755
Can we focus?

440
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:47,841
The treasure's in container 10.

441
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:48,711
10, huh?

442
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:50,784
"X" marks the spot. You get it?

443
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,720
Police made their arrest here.

444
00:19:53,796 --> 00:19:55,335
This container was already open,

445
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:56,774
so they were able to search it.

446
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:59,159
They filed for warrants for
every other container.

447
00:19:59,336 --> 00:20:00,896
Those should take a day.

448
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:03,786
Which means we got to move
the treasure fast, huh?

449
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:05,436
For his wife's sake.

450
00:20:08,196 --> 00:20:09,598
All right, here's the police perimeter.

451
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,364
There's one guard post out front
to let people in and out.

452
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,044
There's a shift change at lunch.

453
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:17,090
Every half hour, the police
will only be stationed

454
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,213
outside the building.

455
00:20:18,423 --> 00:20:19,324
That's our window.

456
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:20,953
Standard police procedure

457
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:22,946
is they check every hour, on the hour.

458
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:23,990
So, we subdue the guards

459
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:25,468
and then we drive the truck in -- boom.

460
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,291
And how do you plan to subdue the cops?

461
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,975
A bullet in each head.

462
00:20:29,449 --> 00:20:31,054
No. No killing.

463
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:33,024
In fact, no guns at all.

464
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:35,103
Oh, Peter, Peter, Peter.
Can I call you Peter?

465
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:36,827
Now that we're working
together and all, huh?

466
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:39,146
The cops would have seen our faces, Peter.

467
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:41,199
Dead men don't talk.

468
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,061
I will not let anyone die on this.

469
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:45,347
That's not up for debate.

470
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:47,922
All right, relax. No guns.

471
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:50,398
It's probably for the best, huh?

472
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:52,840
The little guy's tried
to kill me once already.

473
00:20:52,938 --> 00:20:53,926
Yeah, is there anyone in this room

474
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:55,016
you haven't tried to kill?

475
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:55,958
You.

476
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:57,210
Yet.

477
00:20:57,975 --> 00:20:59,737
But it's starting to cross my mind, Mozzie.

478
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:02,834
So, how do you suggest we get in?

479
00:21:03,688 --> 00:21:06,075
FBI received this an hour ago.

480
00:21:06,525 --> 00:21:09,126
The police are asking
to borrow cargo trucks

481
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:10,694
from other branches of the government.

482
00:21:11,017 --> 00:21:11,862
This is our in.

483
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:12,838
All right, I mean,

484
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,943
we can get through the
perimeter with that, but

485
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:17,725
they're not gonna let us
run around unsupervised.

486
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:20,440
But they'll leave what appears
to be an empty truck unmolested.

487
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:22,693
Barcelona, 2001, huh?

488
00:21:23,186 --> 00:21:24,326
That's what you're thinking, isn't it?

489
00:21:24,376 --> 00:21:25,953
It was Madrid. But, yeah.

490
00:21:26,343 --> 00:21:28,046
You should have seen it.
Caffrey was amazing, right?

491
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:29,865
We were scamming this coin-- 
Let's stay on task.

492
00:21:30,258 --> 00:21:32,591
You and Moz will con the
truck past the cops.

493
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:34,262
Once the truck is alone,

494
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,107
Peter and I will emerge

495
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:36,988
from our hiding place
and grab the treasure.

496
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:37,969
You and Peter?

497
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,259
Nice try, kid.

498
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,268
It'll be you and I stowing away together.

499
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:44,229
It will be like old times.

500
00:21:45,785 --> 00:21:46,883
That isn't for debate.

501
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,826
Look, I've moved the treasure twice.

502
00:21:50,715 --> 00:21:51,723
It needs a big truck.

503
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:53,815
National Guard has some that would work.

504
00:21:53,825 --> 00:21:54,735
I can get us one.

505
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,718
This is gonna be fun, huh?

506
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,948
Who's excited? 
You?

507
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:00,730
Anyone?

508
00:22:18,152 --> 00:22:19,052
Why didn't you leave?

509
00:22:20,993 --> 00:22:22,501
I mean, I know I asked you this before,

510
00:22:22,502 --> 00:22:26,012
but you had the treasure --
why -- why stay in New York?

511
00:22:26,594 --> 00:22:27,811
You've seen what I have here.

512
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,612
Why would I go?

513
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:32,679
Because everyone you know
found out you betrayed them.

514
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:34,998
You know, there's a reason why

515
00:22:34,999 --> 00:22:37,293
our kind doesn't stay
anywhere too long, Caffrey.

516
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,972
It's in our nature to deceive.

517
00:22:40,923 --> 00:22:41,990
You've been living on the run.

518
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,212
How's that going for you?

519
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,174
It's stressful. I'm not gonna lie.

520
00:22:47,581 --> 00:22:48,270
You know what?

521
00:22:49,044 --> 00:22:50,876
With this treasure, I can
pay off the Russians.

522
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:54,006
Disappear somewhere nice.

523
00:22:54,312 --> 00:22:55,618
You're gonna wish you never had it.

524
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,385
All it brings is trouble.

525
00:22:58,836 --> 00:22:59,589
What do you mean by that?

526
00:23:00,825 --> 00:23:01,774
The treasure's cursed?

527
00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:03,320
It's a monkey's paw, huh?

528
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:05,770
Look what's happened to
everyone who's gone after it.

529
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,702
Maybe you're just making
the wrong kind of wishes.

530
00:23:20,176 --> 00:23:21,361
We've got 48 hours

531
00:23:21,392 --> 00:23:22,970
while the truck's sent in for maintenance.

532
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:25,303
I procured us some uniforms.

533
00:23:25,468 --> 00:23:28,396
Aw, you are gonna look
adorable in this, Mozzie, huh?

534
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,077
It's a shame I removed
that price from your head.

535
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:32,246
Eh, put it back on.

536
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:33,638
You'll make a great human shield.

537
00:23:34,908 --> 00:23:36,077
Time to check in with your missus.

538
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:39,340
Any update?

539
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,900
Jones is working an angle.

540
00:23:41,016 --> 00:23:41,851
It's a long shot,

541
00:23:41,852 --> 00:23:45,291
but every hour we buy gets them
closer to finding Elizabeth.

542
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:46,822
We won't be able to stall again.

543
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:48,705
If they don't find her soon...

544
00:23:48,706 --> 00:23:50,419
We'll have to go through with the break-in.

545
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:08,800
The safe house was a decoy.

546
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:10,006
Keller's playing with us.

547
00:24:11,712 --> 00:24:12,292
What?

548
00:24:12,597 --> 00:24:13,719
Cherry blossoms.

549
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,001
Clear the table.

550
00:24:18,322 --> 00:24:19,188
Okay, so, listen up.

551
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:22,136
ERTs found faint traces
of cherry-blossom pollen

552
00:24:22,137 --> 00:24:23,745
on one of the shoe prints
at the crime scene.

553
00:24:23,746 --> 00:24:26,128
The pollen we found was of
a variety called fugenzo.

554
00:24:26,263 --> 00:24:27,582
Now, according to Parks and Rec,

555
00:24:27,614 --> 00:24:29,384
only one place has that specific type.

556
00:24:29,606 --> 00:24:31,525
There's a damn good chance
Elizabeth can be found

557
00:24:31,526 --> 00:24:32,799
somewhere in this radius.

558
00:24:32,892 --> 00:24:34,325
Hit the streets. Go door-to-door.

559
00:24:34,326 --> 00:24:35,624
Whatever it takes. Let's go.

560
00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:03,375
I could write it for you, if it helps.

561
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:04,443
Don't talk to me. I'm fine.

562
00:25:04,745 --> 00:25:05,893
If Keller comes back late,

563
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:07,533
you could always learn to be a lefty.

564
00:25:07,602 --> 00:25:09,059
And you can learn to walk with one foot.

565
00:25:12,062 --> 00:25:13,326
Look, it's New York City.

566
00:25:13,507 --> 00:25:15,001
There's a pharmacy on every corner.

567
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:17,073
But without antibiotics...

568
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:20,613
I'll be right back.

569
00:25:21,595 --> 00:25:22,324
Don't move.

570
00:25:22,977 --> 00:25:23,877
Where would I go?

571
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:43,254
Are you okay?

572
00:25:44,062 --> 00:25:44,657
Fine.

573
00:25:46,095 --> 00:25:47,992
You know, the first thing I learned

574
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:49,125
about the life of a con

575
00:25:49,126 --> 00:25:50,428
is that in order to survive,

576
00:25:50,474 --> 00:25:51,764
you have to look out for yourself.

577
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:54,455
Then why are you here?

578
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:56,413
Survival is overrated.

579
00:25:56,743 --> 00:25:58,191
And I find myself reminded

580
00:25:58,192 --> 00:26:01,571
that an unshared life is not living.

581
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:03,233
So you're saying you care?

582
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:05,155
About Mrs. Suit.

583
00:26:06,835 --> 00:26:07,644
And...

584
00:26:15,804 --> 00:26:17,215
Remind you of the good old days, buddy?

585
00:26:19,483 --> 00:26:20,678
You're using all the oxygen.

586
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,565
You see, after that last time,

587
00:26:23,566 --> 00:26:24,857
we were sneaking out of somewhere

588
00:26:24,858 --> 00:26:26,915
because you got caught in
bed with that princess.

589
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,150
I didn't get caught in bed with her.

590
00:26:30,636 --> 00:26:32,312
They found me on the ledge
outside her window.

591
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:35,848
I remember seeing you standing there

592
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,438
with nothing but a solid-gold
tray covering your junk.

593
00:26:41,824 --> 00:26:43,086
I was the one that got you down from there

594
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:44,338
before they started shooting at you.

595
00:26:46,784 --> 00:26:47,969
You had my back then.

596
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:52,616
Like I said, "the good old days."

597
00:26:52,932 --> 00:26:53,617
They were.

598
00:26:54,401 --> 00:26:55,593
What happened to you, Keller?

599
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:58,202
I could ask the same thing to you, Neal.

600
00:27:02,683 --> 00:27:03,976
I could ask the same thing to you.

601
00:27:09,313 --> 00:27:10,275
You'll have to turn around.

602
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:11,542
This area's off-limits.

603
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:13,839
Uh, that's precisely why we're here.

604
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:15,302
You got the paperwork? 
Yeah.

605
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,937
Hey, you.

606
00:27:16,938 --> 00:27:19,200
You put out an order for trucks,
so we brought you a truck.

607
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:20,754
I haven't seen this.

608
00:27:21,068 --> 00:27:22,811
Until I see this come
through proper channels,

609
00:27:22,812 --> 00:27:23,637
you're not coming in.

610
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:25,570
You're holding the orders
in your hand right now.

611
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:27,826
Sorry, buddy. Turn the truck around.

612
00:27:28,506 --> 00:27:29,139
Fine.

613
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,496
Then this truck is your responsibility.

614
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:38,946
Give me the plans.

615
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:41,920
Why?
Give me the plans.

616
00:27:45,312 --> 00:27:46,363
You see this "X"?

617
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:50,210
This truck needs to be parked right on it.

618
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:54,655
Is Burke showing that cop our plan?

619
00:27:54,699 --> 00:27:56,198
Look, I'm sure he's got it under control.

620
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:58,143
The truck now is your problem.

621
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,648
He's crazy. I respect that.

622
00:28:01,075 --> 00:28:01,997
Yes, it is.

623
00:28:02,052 --> 00:28:02,893
This "X."

624
00:28:02,904 --> 00:28:04,734
Park the truck on it now.

625
00:28:07,003 --> 00:28:07,907
And what if I don't?

626
00:28:13,216 --> 00:28:14,884
Oh, it's your ass, not ours.

627
00:28:17,164 --> 00:28:18,138
Thanks for your help.

628
00:28:20,815 --> 00:28:21,383
Okay, so now

629
00:28:21,384 --> 00:28:23,955
they've got our truck and
our plans to break in?

630
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:24,933
Yeah.

631
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,393
What happens if they don't drive it in?

632
00:28:27,844 --> 00:28:28,717
They will.

633
00:28:30,006 --> 00:28:31,183
Come on. Drive it in.

634
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,152
Nicely played, Suit.

635
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,103
All right, let's get to
the rendezvous point.

636
00:28:41,495 --> 00:28:43,572
All right, we must be there.

637
00:28:43,573 --> 00:28:44,989
The truck hasn't moved in a while.

638
00:28:46,247 --> 00:28:48,143
It's five after.
Everyone should be at lunch.

639
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:51,165
All right. We got 55 minutes
to load everything up.

640
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:06,716
What is it?

641
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:09,044
Apparently, they skipped lunch.

642
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,550
We have plainclothes
searching the radius, boss,

643
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:20,808
we have cellphone interceptors
picking up all nearby calls,

644
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:22,550
and we have agents on the
roofs, scanning the crowd.

645
00:29:22,574 --> 00:29:24,349
- Good work, Diana.
- Let me talk to him.

646
00:29:24,604 --> 00:29:25,326
Peter.

647
00:29:25,699 --> 00:29:27,664
That storage facility you
had me looking into?

648
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:28,315
Yeah?

649
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:29,932
Whatever they found there,
it's important enough

650
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:32,317
that they have the 22nd Precinct 
doing double shifts.

651
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,878
That mean working through lunch?

652
00:29:34,643 --> 00:29:35,410
I guess so.

653
00:29:35,535 --> 00:29:37,753
Jones, we need to find her now.

654
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:39,097
Every second counts.

655
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:43,759
We got a problem.

656
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,162
This is some kind of double-cross.

657
00:29:47,188 --> 00:29:49,255
Not everything is an angle, Keller.

658
00:29:51,202 --> 00:29:51,964
We should've brought guns.

659
00:29:51,965 --> 00:29:53,801
Yeah, 'cause that would've worked out well.

660
00:30:01,074 --> 00:30:02,574
Just like old times.

661
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,311
Excuse me.

662
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:08,909
Are you the sergeant in charge? 
I am.

663
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,555
Good. Glad you guys could make it.

664
00:30:10,556 --> 00:30:13,389
Look, we got to load
container 10 into the truck.

665
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,372
Well, our orders are

666
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:16,860
to wait for the warrant to
come in for container 2.

667
00:30:18,147 --> 00:30:20,863
You're 22nd Precinct, right? 
That's us.

668
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:22,752
Then you're here to help
us load container 10.

669
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,287
No, we were told that the warrant for that

670
00:30:24,354 --> 00:30:25,788
wouldn't be in till the end of the day.

671
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:26,803
Nah, it came through 20 minutes ago.

672
00:30:26,804 --> 00:30:28,558
Come on. We'll show you.
We already been there.

673
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,860
Now, look, there's 17 wood boxes
that need to be hauled out.

674
00:30:30,928 --> 00:30:32,895
Yeah, makes you wonder
what's inside them, right?

675
00:30:32,963 --> 00:30:33,930
Yeah, don't it?

676
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:35,105
But I got told if I looked,

677
00:30:35,106 --> 00:30:36,924
I'd be working dispatch for a year.

678
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,820
Are you sure this is right?

679
00:30:38,888 --> 00:30:40,555
If not, then why would I have the key? 
Yeah.

680
00:30:44,195 --> 00:30:46,997
A bunch of Neo-Nazis? 
Above my pay grade.

681
00:30:47,065 --> 00:30:48,723
How many boxes does that look like, huh?

682
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:50,190
It looks like 17 to me.

683
00:30:52,596 --> 00:30:54,784
Everybody, change of plans!

684
00:30:54,785 --> 00:30:57,020
We're emptying this container out.

685
00:30:57,087 --> 00:30:58,421
All right, they're all yours.

686
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,891
But I need to see the warrant, of course.

687
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,827
Of course. 
We'll get them to you in a bit.

688
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:07,063
I got to see it now.
You know, procedures and all.

689
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,100
Sure.

690
00:31:11,848 --> 00:31:14,550
Come with me.

691
00:31:14,795 --> 00:31:17,319
Heaviest to the back, if you can.

692
00:31:18,397 --> 00:31:19,397
I hope you understand,

693
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:21,200
but things just have to
be done a certain way.

694
00:31:21,268 --> 00:31:22,635
Yeah, rules are rules. 
I get it.

695
00:31:25,034 --> 00:31:27,001
Where are we going?

696
00:31:27,069 --> 00:31:28,069
Sergeant!

697
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:29,502
No, no, it's no trouble at all.

698
00:31:29,503 --> 00:31:30,905
He's right here, sir.

699
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:32,104
It's the D.A.'s office.

700
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:34,055
They want to touch base with you.

701
00:31:36,123 --> 00:31:37,410
Sergeant Brubaker.

702
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:40,331
Sergeant, this is the
District Attorney's aide.

703
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,846
How can I help clear things up?

704
00:31:41,914 --> 00:31:44,649
What part of "no killing"
do you keep forgetting?

705
00:31:44,717 --> 00:31:46,751
Finding a dead body can take hours.

706
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:48,753
This lie can fall apart any second.

707
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:49,702
Peter will take care of it.

708
00:31:50,523 --> 00:31:52,624
You really have gone native, haven't you?

709
00:31:53,756 --> 00:31:55,171
Got it.

710
00:31:56,224 --> 00:31:57,775
It's all good, gents. Thank you.

711
00:31:57,776 --> 00:31:59,462
Thank you, sir. 
Take it easy.

712
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:03,253
No, you walk in front of me.

713
00:32:04,126 --> 00:32:05,796
We got a hit on the accomplice's account.

714
00:32:05,797 --> 00:32:07,579
It was used at a pharmacy
three blocks away --

715
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,202
rubbing alcohol,
antibacterials, and bandages.

716
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,204
Sounds like a guy worried about a dog bite.

717
00:32:12,272 --> 00:32:14,339
Everybody spread out.
He's in the vicinity.

718
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,919
All right. Thanks a lot, guys.
Appreciate the help.

719
00:32:17,986 --> 00:32:19,787
Hey, the beers are on me, right?

720
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,526
You ready? 
Yep. I think we're good to --

721
00:32:25,594 --> 00:32:26,794
Oh!

722
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,951
Thanks, hon.

723
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:32,185
All right, here's for nothing.

724
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:52,160
Okay, I don't know how the hell
you got out of there, but --

725
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:53,995
Aaaaaaah! My hand!

726
00:32:56,491 --> 00:32:57,558
Go ahead.

727
00:32:57,626 --> 00:32:59,927
Drop it.

728
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,966
Neal's not picking up.
I think something went wrong.

729
00:33:07,602 --> 00:33:08,402
Neal?

730
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,070
Disappointed?

731
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:11,105
El.

732
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:11,972
She's okay?

733
00:33:12,507 --> 00:33:14,553
I'm safe. 
Oh, thank God.

734
00:33:14,554 --> 00:33:15,670
They caught the guy holding me.

735
00:33:15,671 --> 00:33:16,937
Are you all right?

736
00:33:16,938 --> 00:33:19,082
I am now. Where are you?

737
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:21,474
Uh, 23rd and 3rd. 
They're taking me home.

738
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:22,934
Where's Keller?

739
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:24,486
He's with Neal.

740
00:33:24,487 --> 00:33:26,254
I can't get ahold of him.

741
00:33:26,322 --> 00:33:27,847
Go get him. El.

742
00:33:28,725 --> 00:33:31,059
Go. Then come back to me.

743
00:33:32,689 --> 00:33:34,857
Mozzie, we need to figure
out where Keller's headed.

744
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:36,127
Oh, way ahead of you, Suit.

745
00:33:36,128 --> 00:33:38,483
I've already mapped out
potential escape routes.

746
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:41,237
From this point, it's
2.4 miles to the docks

747
00:33:41,238 --> 00:33:43,082
and 16.1 to Teterboro.

748
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:45,364
All right.
You take the air, I'll take the sea,

749
00:33:45,365 --> 00:33:47,246
and the bureau will back us up on both.

750
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,286
I'm gonna need to get in one of these cars.

751
00:33:50,287 --> 00:33:51,620
Oh, already done.

752
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:18,280
All right.

753
00:34:30,994 --> 00:34:31,927
You've got to be kidding me.

754
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,927
Caffrey.

755
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,595
Come on, Caffrey. I know you're in there.

756
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,932
There's no way out, buddy.

757
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,911
You and me... to the bitter end, eh?

758
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:27,408
All right.

759
00:35:45,407 --> 00:35:47,441
Not a Raphael.

760
00:35:47,509 --> 00:35:49,843
You wouldn't.

761
00:35:55,448 --> 00:35:56,949
Oh, God.

762
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:01,580
First rule of a fight --

763
00:36:01,648 --> 00:36:04,083
always go for the weak spot.

764
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,561
Easy there, Burke, huh?

765
00:36:15,628 --> 00:36:17,144
I got the wife. Remember that.

766
00:36:17,145 --> 00:36:18,446
Not anymore.

767
00:36:18,513 --> 00:36:19,046
Huh?

768
00:36:22,495 --> 00:36:23,997
"Not anymore"? What are you, bluffing me?

769
00:36:23,998 --> 00:36:26,665
Call your guy. Tell him he can
get a great slice of pizza

770
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:28,400
right at the corner of 23rd and 3rd.

771
00:36:29,637 --> 00:36:31,071
Don't matter...

772
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,934
'Cause I'll get her again.

773
00:36:32,935 --> 00:36:34,951
And again and again.

774
00:36:49,503 --> 00:36:50,637
Hey.
Hey!

775
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:55,742
Come on.

776
00:37:02,983 --> 00:37:03,817
Unh!

777
00:37:13,294 --> 00:37:14,861
Did we really get Elizabeth?

778
00:37:14,929 --> 00:37:16,096
We did.

779
00:37:17,976 --> 00:37:20,204
How'd you make that shot?

780
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:21,707
Long story.

781
00:37:47,576 --> 00:37:48,590
You okay?

782
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:49,904
Yeah. You?

783
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,682
What now?

784
00:37:52,683 --> 00:37:54,205
Keller needs to go away forever,

785
00:37:54,206 --> 00:37:56,773
and to make that happen, I need
to give a full confession.

786
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,912
That means prison.

787
00:37:58,913 --> 00:38:00,005
A lot of it.

788
00:38:00,006 --> 00:38:01,224
I know.

789
00:38:02,425 --> 00:38:03,716
I'll turn myself in tomorrow morning.

790
00:38:03,717 --> 00:38:05,704
That should give you a 12-hour head start.

791
00:38:07,693 --> 00:38:09,193
The treasure's gone.

792
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:13,293
Do you think you can survive without it?

793
00:38:13,361 --> 00:38:16,530
I always have a contingency plan.

794
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,189
If you want a happy ending,

795
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,373
it depends on where you stop the story.

796
00:38:22,646 --> 00:38:24,623
I think our story stops here.

797
00:38:26,182 --> 00:38:29,142
And...ends well.

798
00:38:31,006 --> 00:38:32,806
Till the next chapter.

799
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:36,014
Till the next chapter.

800
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,828
Good morning, Neal.

801
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:07,954
Morning.

802
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:11,249
How's Elizabeth?

803
00:39:11,317 --> 00:39:13,618
She's well, considering.

804
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:14,986
I know what I've done.

805
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,588
And I know what I need to
do to take Keller down.

806
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,391
I'm ready to make a full confession.

807
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,479
You know what that will mean.

808
00:39:25,123 --> 00:39:26,290
I do.

809
00:39:26,357 --> 00:39:27,574
Are you sure?

810
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,327
You're willing to give up everything?

811
00:39:31,963 --> 00:39:32,996
Yeah.

812
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,880
I'm glad to hear that.

813
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:41,171
But before you go any further,
I want to show you something.

814
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:42,239
Peter, please.

815
00:39:42,307 --> 00:39:43,841
I need to get this out now.

816
00:39:43,908 --> 00:39:45,409
Watch.

817
00:39:47,716 --> 00:39:50,964
What is this?
Keller's interrogation from last night.

818
00:39:52,988 --> 00:39:54,054
I stole the treasure.

819
00:39:55,624 --> 00:39:57,018
And I was the one that
burned down the warehouse

820
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,789
and took it from Vincent Adler.

821
00:40:00,529 --> 00:40:02,163
Adler didn't deserve it.

822
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,565
It belongs to the people of Russia.

823
00:40:04,633 --> 00:40:06,694
I take full responsibility.

824
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:10,909
I alone recovered this priceless artwork...

825
00:40:11,357 --> 00:40:13,325
that was so nearly lost to history.

826
00:40:16,776 --> 00:40:18,433
He took credit for it.

827
00:40:18,434 --> 00:40:19,621
Yep.

828
00:40:20,792 --> 00:40:21,841
Why?

829
00:40:21,864 --> 00:40:23,998
He said he'd give a full confession

830
00:40:24,066 --> 00:40:27,102
as long as it was in front
of the Russian authorities.

831
00:40:27,169 --> 00:40:28,570
The treasure was originally pillaged

832
00:40:28,637 --> 00:40:29,588
from the Russian museums.

833
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:32,899
And now Keller claimed that
he stole it to save it,

834
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,464
return it to the motherland.

835
00:40:34,677 --> 00:40:36,338
The Russian mob wanted him dead.

836
00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:38,874
Yeah, and now they're helping
pay for his legal defense.

837
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:40,324
Son of a bitch.

838
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,684
As far as anyone is concerned,

839
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:46,788
he's the one who recovered
the treasure of a lifetime.

840
00:40:46,856 --> 00:40:48,919
Not you. Not Mozzie.

841
00:40:50,302 --> 00:40:51,368
Doesn't bother you?

842
00:40:53,944 --> 00:40:54,944
No.

843
00:40:57,062 --> 00:40:58,489
It doesn't.

844
00:41:00,017 --> 00:41:02,767
I know what you were prepared to do.

845
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:06,490
And it means a lot that you
were willing to do it.

846
00:41:06,558 --> 00:41:08,125
What happens now?

847
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:11,217
Peter. You're gonna want to see this.

848
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,120
Diana. 
Trust me.

849
00:41:27,691 --> 00:41:29,131
What is it?

850
00:41:31,662 --> 00:41:34,445
This is a letter from the U.S.
probation office.

851
00:41:34,446 --> 00:41:37,307
It is to inform you that a
hearing has been scheduled

852
00:41:37,308 --> 00:41:39,191
concerning your probation.

853
00:41:39,436 --> 00:41:41,838
Because of your outstanding service,

854
00:41:41,905 --> 00:41:44,140
including recovering the treasure

855
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:45,641
and catching Keller,

856
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:48,468
the U.S. probation office
is convening a hearing

857
00:41:48,469 --> 00:41:52,525
to discuss the commutation
of your sentence.

858
00:41:52,526 --> 00:41:54,571
What does that mean?

859
00:41:54,572 --> 00:41:56,940
It means no anklet.

860
00:41:56,941 --> 00:41:58,129
No nothing.

861
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,418
In three months, you could be a free man.

862
00:42:01,443 --> 00:42:11,643
