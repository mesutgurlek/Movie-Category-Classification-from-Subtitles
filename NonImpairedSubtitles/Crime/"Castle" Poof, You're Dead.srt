1
00:00:12,994 --> 00:00:14,493
Don't go in there.

2
00:00:32,294 --> 00:00:33,191
No!

3
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,182
I gotta go.

4
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:48,293
Me, too.

5
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:50,167
Mm.

6
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:56,357
I'll see you 
at the scene, sexy.

7
00:00:56,358 --> 00:00:57,306
Okay.

8
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:04,279
Javier Esposito.
Mm-hmm.

9
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,216
When we get to this crime scene,
do not wink at me,

10
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:08,289
do not smile at me,

11
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,303
and don't even look at me with
those puppy dog eyes. Got it?

12
00:01:13,994 --> 00:01:14,910
Got it.

13
00:01:17,396 --> 00:01:18,320
Ooh.

14
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:20,251
Come on, Gina.

15
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:22,369
I'm not having this
conversation with you again.

16
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,358
Well, I'm... I gotta go.
I'm at work.

17
00:01:24,754 --> 00:01:26,228
It is so work.

18
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:28,789
What's up, Castle? How's it going?

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,403
You want my advice? Never sleep
with someone you work with.

20
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,485
What? What do you mean?

21
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:37,335
Trust me. It doesn't end well.

22
00:01:37,336 --> 00:01:38,428
Who knows?

23
00:01:39,529 --> 00:01:41,067
Everyone knows.

24
00:01:41,088 --> 00:01:42,464
Everyone knows what?

25
00:01:42,465 --> 00:01:43,428
Nothing.

26
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:46,348
On my way.

27
00:01:46,516 --> 00:01:48,307
You okay, Castle? You seem upset.

28
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:51,036
No, no, I'm fine. Why?

29
00:01:51,332 --> 00:01:52,214
Okay.

30
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:56,545
The murder is here at
Drake's Magic Shop?

31
00:01:56,546 --> 00:01:57,336
Yep.

32
00:01:57,337 --> 00:01:59,544
I've been coming here
since I was 13 years old.

33
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:02,221
This place is a
paradise for boys...

34
00:02:02,257 --> 00:02:05,217
Whoopee cushions,
magic tricks, fake vomit.

35
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:06,970
It's not just for boys, Castle.

36
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:08,745
My grandfather was
an amateur magician,

37
00:02:08,746 --> 00:02:11,033
and I used to come here
almost every Sunday afternoon

38
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:12,846
when I was that age, too.

39
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:15,966
I never pegged you
for a magic fan.

40
00:02:16,234 --> 00:02:17,607
You know any good tricks?

41
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:19,484
I do this one thing

42
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:21,096
with ice cubes.

43
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:24,159
According to his
water-soaked wallet,

44
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,817
the victim's Zalman Drake,
the shop owner.

45
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:30,086
His assistant, Eliza Winter,
found him in the tank

46
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:31,776
when she opened up the
store this morning.

47
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,026
Any signs of forced entry?

48
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,327
No. You know, it is beyond me

49
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:36,874
why people think
this is entertaining.

50
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,201
I see a guy hanging upside
down in a water tank,

51
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:40,809
I think, you are a fool.

52
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,410
Hmm. See the milk cans and
the water torture tank,

53
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:46,404
they were real game
changers in the magic world.

54
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:47,866
They were the first presentation

55
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,188
of real life-and-death
consequences.

56
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:53,368
As the magician held his breath,
so did the audience.

57
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:55,371
Well, this magician would've
had to hold his breath

58
00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:57,593
eight to ten hours if
he wanted to take a bow.

59
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:01,087
So you're saying between 12:00 and 2:00 A.M.?
Looks that way,

60
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:04,644
petechial hemorrhaging in
his eyes indicate drowning.

61
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:08,152
Failed escape attempt?
Well, there's no redness around his ankles

62
00:03:08,153 --> 00:03:09,054
where he was hanging.

63
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,487
Doesn't look like he
struggled to get out.

64
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,370
I have a feeling he was dead
before he hit the water,

65
00:03:13,371 --> 00:03:15,466
but I won't know for sure until
I get him back to the lab.

66
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:17,387
Maybe there's another
reason he didn't struggle.

67
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,282
Suicide note.

68
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:21,622
It says he was in
financial trouble

69
00:03:21,623 --> 00:03:23,592
and couldn't bear the thought
of losing his family's shop,

70
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:27,460
so he was gonna kill himself.
Mr. Drake did not kill himself.

71
00:03:28,527 --> 00:03:30,707
How do you know?
I just know.

72
00:03:30,804 --> 00:03:33,487
- Is it true, though? Was he gonna lose
his shop? - No.

73
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,555
I mean, yes, but two
weeks ago, he told me

74
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:37,443
that everything was fine,

75
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:39,946
that he had worked it all out.
Any idea how?

76
00:03:39,947 --> 00:03:42,363
Was there a windfall
or an investor?

77
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:43,952
He didn't say.

78
00:03:43,953 --> 00:03:44,518
Would he have been able

79
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,741
to place himself in that tank?
Absolutely.

80
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:50,470
But he wouldn't have.
Not Zalman.

81
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:52,929
He loved and respected
magic too much.

82
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:56,731
Esposito, there's
no signature here.

83
00:03:58,173 --> 00:04:00,404
I'll have C.S.U. run it for prints.
Have them run the tank

84
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:02,811
and the entries and exits as well.
Okay.

85
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,798
When was the last
time you saw him?

86
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,741
Yesterday morning.
He left right after lunch,

87
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:09,411
and he was gone the
rest of the day.

88
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:13,092
Did he say where he was going?
Was it normal for him

89
00:04:13,093 --> 00:04:14,641
to leave the shop in
the middle of the day?

90
00:04:14,642 --> 00:04:17,238
Yeah. He would do that sometimes.

91
00:04:17,243 --> 00:04:19,178
Did you notice any
changes in his behavior

92
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:21,929
or anything unusual
going on in his life?

93
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,458
This past month,
he was gone m-more often.

94
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:28,608
All he'd say was that he
was working on something.

95
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:32,343
But he looked a little tired,
like he hadn't been sleeping.

96
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:34,384
Can you think of any
reason for the change?

97
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:38,272
Yes. Last month,
right before all this started,

98
00:04:38,273 --> 00:04:40,901
a guy came into the shop
and attacked Mr. Drake.

99
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:43,214
He pushed him right
through a display case.

100
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:44,653
He said he better watch his back,

101
00:04:44,654 --> 00:04:47,114
and he was gonna sue him
for all he was worth.

102
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:51,419
Thank you. I will hold.

103
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,206
So court records show that

104
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:56,229
a lawsuit was filed against
Zalman Drake a month ago.

105
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,938
They're pulling it up now.
Hey.

106
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:59,969
Hey. We canvassed the area
around the magic shop.

107
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,013
One of the neighbors said
she saw an old white van

108
00:05:02,014 --> 00:05:03,633
pull up to the shop
around midnight

109
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:06,149
and then heard the gate roll up.
Okay, you guys look into that,

110
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,151
and let's find out where
Zalman was disappearing to.

111
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:09,132
I'd like to know what he was doing

112
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:11,066
all the way up until the
moment that he died.

113
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:12,091
What about his next of kin?

114
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:14,172
Only surviving relative's
a brother in Poughkeepsie.

115
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:16,572
We haven't reached him yet.
All right, thank you, guys.

116
00:05:17,072 --> 00:05:18,731
Poughkeepsie?
Hey.

117
00:05:19,558 --> 00:05:22,155
X-ray specs.
Got 'em at the magic shop.

118
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,954
I can see you naked.

119
00:05:25,077 --> 00:05:26,342
Really?
Mm.

120
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,079
How do you like my navel ring?

121
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:30,614
Looks like somebody has a secret.

122
00:05:30,615 --> 00:05:34,060
A secret? Uh, what secret?

123
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,206
I can understand a guy
not wanting to share.

124
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:38,307
I mean, some things are personal.

125
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:40,515
How did you find out?

126
00:05:40,896 --> 00:05:42,292
Dude, everybody knows.

127
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:44,107
It's all over "page six."

128
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,406
"Looks like an unhappy ending

129
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:51,881
for the publisher and
the mystery writer."

130
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:52,921
Apparently,

131
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:57,436
he and ex-wife/girlfriend/
publisher Gina

132
00:05:57,437 --> 00:06:00,283
had some words...
loud words... at Le Cirque,

133
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:01,676
and she stormed off.

134
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:03,792
That's what he was talking
about this morning.

135
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:05,295
What I don't understand
is why he would try

136
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:07,948
to hide it from us.
I mean, we're like family.

137
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:10,074
Maybe he's afraid of
what we might think.

138
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:15,142
So it turns out a lawsuit was
filed against Zalman Drake

139
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:17,652
by a Jerome Aspenall.

140
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:19,046
And get this...

141
00:06:19,057 --> 00:06:21,058
The judge threw it out yesterday.

142
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:24,454
Maybe Jerome decided to take
justice into his own hands.

143
00:06:24,872 --> 00:06:26,264
What was he suing him for?

144
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:28,684
Zalman Drake?
I was suing him for slander,

145
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:30,718
defamation of character,
ruining my life.

146
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:33,930
And how did Zalman do that, Jerome?
He read my friggin' mind,

147
00:06:33,931 --> 00:06:36,669
in front of, like, 300 people.
During a magic performance?

148
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,006
Yeah. It was like
this mind reading,

149
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:40,687
card tricks, levitation,
at this chichi charity ball.

150
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:41,708
My in-laws won a table,

151
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,496
and I figured, free food,
some entertainment,

152
00:06:43,497 --> 00:06:45,774
maybe later, I get lucky.
Turns out not so lucky.

153
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:47,376
Could you elaborate on that?
Yeah,

154
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:49,584
this magician, Zalman Drake,
gets onstage,

155
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:51,455
makes this rich dude
disappear and reappear,

156
00:06:51,456 --> 00:06:52,589
and I'm like, "Oh, that's cool."

157
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,168
Then he asks for volunteers.
My wife raises my hand

158
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:57,496
and says "Go up there, it'll be fun,"
so I do. Drake says,

159
00:06:57,497 --> 00:07:00,518
"Stand across from me and
think good thoughts," so I do.

160
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,023
He looks at me, concentrates,

161
00:07:02,024 --> 00:07:04,584
puts his fingers on my forehead,
and he goes, "You're thinking

162
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:08,172
of Rita and your trip to Atlantic
city last weekend." Were you?

163
00:07:08,353 --> 00:07:10,373
Yeah, but I was trying not to,

164
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:12,428
'cause here's the kicker...
Your wife's name isn't Rita.

165
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:13,700
Right.
Mm.

166
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:16,534
So now I'm living in a
motel in Long Island City,

167
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:19,230
my father-in-law fired me,
and Rita won't even talk to me

168
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,662
'cause my wife found her
number and called her.

169
00:07:20,663 --> 00:07:22,806
Where were you last night
between 12:00 and 2:00?

170
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,103
Why is she asking me that?

171
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:28,105
Well, she wants to know if you have an alibi.
For what?

172
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:31,051
Zalman Drake was
murdered last night.

173
00:07:33,638 --> 00:07:35,234
Justice is served.

174
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,389
When he read your mind,
did it take him very long?

175
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,876
No, he... No. No.
Didn't think so.

176
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:46,675
Jerome, we have a witness who
says you went to his shop,

177
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:48,596
attacked, and
threatened Zalman Drake.

178
00:07:48,597 --> 00:07:50,507
When they dropped your
lawsuit yesterday,

179
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:52,986
did you decide to take the
law into your own hands?

180
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:55,150
Did you go to the magic
shop and murder Zalman?

181
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:56,468
No, I didn't go
anywhere last night

182
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:58,563
except for O'Lannahan's
at 57th and Seventh,

183
00:07:58,564 --> 00:08:00,883
because thanks to Zalman Drake,
I no longer have a wife

184
00:08:00,884 --> 00:08:03,210
or a mistress to go home to.

185
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:05,341
Wonder how Zalman did it.

186
00:08:05,342 --> 00:08:06,983
He must have lifted something
from Jerome's pocket

187
00:08:06,984 --> 00:08:09,143
with a receipt from
his weekend of sin.

188
00:08:09,144 --> 00:08:10,106
Like this.

189
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:14,105
You had your hand in my pocket,
and I didn't even feel it?

190
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:15,396
Do it again.

191
00:08:26,695 --> 00:08:27,594
What?

192
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,266
Hey, Ryan.

193
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:32,998
Any luck narrowing down
Zalman's whereabouts yesterday?

194
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:34,337
Uh, not yet,

195
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:36,907
but I did check into Jerome's
whereabouts last night.

196
00:08:36,908 --> 00:08:39,202
The barkeep at O'Lannahan's
said he was there till closing.

197
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:40,486
He called him a cab. So the only

198
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,461
thing he killed last night
were his brain cells.

199
00:08:42,462 --> 00:08:45,469
And a forensic sweep of the
water tank came up negative

200
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,102
for any prints on the operating
apparatus other than Zalman's.

201
00:08:48,103 --> 00:08:50,692
So either he committed suicide...
Or the killer wore gloves.

202
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:52,695
Not the whole time.
According to the lab,

203
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:54,893
there were fingerprints all
over that suicide note,

204
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:56,668
and they weren't
Zalman's or Jerome's.

205
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,996
Did you get a match? Yeah,
to a Charles "Chuck" Russell.

206
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,290
A low-life street magician

207
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,780
with three arrests
and two convictions...

208
00:09:02,781 --> 00:09:04,017
one for arson and another on

209
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:06,676
an explosives charge.
Did he know our victim?

210
00:09:06,677 --> 00:09:08,950
Yeah, apparently Zalman
is some big muckety-muck

211
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:10,247
with the American Magicians Guild.

212
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:12,713
They have a code of professional conduct,
and Chuck broke it.

213
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:14,958
He was reckless with
pyrotechnics in his act,

214
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,519
injured his assistant,
so Zalman had him kicked out.

215
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,829
He hasn't been able to book a gig since.
Where can we find him?

216
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,750
So I have Brenda's watch here.

217
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:24,374
She wants me to make
her husband disappear.

218
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,228
That's a felony. I can't do that.

219
00:09:26,229 --> 00:09:29,709
But I can make the
watch disappear.

220
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,719
Give it up. That was
incredible, really.

221
00:09:32,474 --> 00:09:33,744
Thank you, Brenda.

222
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:37,055
Aw. $1.

223
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:41,455
I'll dine on raman and tap
water tonight and think of you.

224
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:42,846
What about you?
You got a little something

225
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:45,297
for the United Magicians College fund?

226
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:46,904
As a matter of fact, I do.

227
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:49,256
We need to talk to you
about Zalman Drake.

228
00:09:49,884 --> 00:09:51,313
Abracadabra.

229
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,457
Alakazam, jackass.

230
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:23,638
Why am I here?

231
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:27,806
You recognize this?
That's a baggie and that's a letter.

232
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:28,803
Next.

233
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:31,663
Careful, Chucky.
Next could be a murder charge.

234
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,951
Your fingerprints are on it.
So?

235
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:36,629
So I find it strange that
someone else's fingerprints

236
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,918
are on another guy's suicide note.

237
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:42,324
What are you talking about?
Your old friend Zalman Drake.

238
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:43,787
Zalman?

239
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:47,709
Yeah, that's him.

240
00:10:48,146 --> 00:10:49,328
He killed himself?

241
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:51,434
Man.
We found him drowned

242
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:53,723
in the water torture
trick in his shop.

243
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:55,339
You must have thought
you were pretty clever,

244
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,306
staging it to look
like a botched escape.

245
00:10:57,307 --> 00:11:00,519
I didn't stage anything.
I had nothing to do with it.

246
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,140
Well, then maybe you can
explain your prints on that.

247
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,266
All right.

248
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:13,939
No, wait. Okay, listen,
I-I-I gave him this note.

249
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,828
You gave him a suicide note?

250
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:16,587
Not that note.

251
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:19,345
The other note on the paper.
The one you can't see.

252
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:23,407
Hold it under a black light.

253
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,296
It's an invoice for
services rendered.

254
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:29,859
What kind of services?

255
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,599
He wanted me to get him something,

256
00:11:32,116 --> 00:11:33,360
something illegal.

257
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,591
C4 explosives?

258
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:39,860
Ironic, right?

259
00:11:40,335 --> 00:11:41,670
He wants explosives from me

260
00:11:41,671 --> 00:11:43,477
when that's what he
got me booted for.

261
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:45,748
But he promised to get me
reinstated in the Guild,

262
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:50,257
and I wanted to work.
Whoever wrote this note

263
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:52,299
probably thought they took
a blank piece of paper.

264
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,051
Whoever being not me.

265
00:11:54,052 --> 00:11:58,241
You provided him with enough C4
to blow up half a city block.

266
00:11:58,242 --> 00:12:00,591
What was it for?
Maybe it was for a magic trick.

267
00:12:00,592 --> 00:12:01,506
Come on.

268
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:03,768
Nah, listen, Zalman
didn't just run the shop

269
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:05,509
and do corporate gigs.

270
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,341
He was also this
genius trick designer.

271
00:12:08,642 --> 00:12:09,935
Rumor has it, he was creating

272
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:12,899
cutting-edge illusions for
the hottest guy out there.

273
00:12:13,143 --> 00:12:15,499
And who is the hottest
guy out there?

274
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,517
Tobias Strange?
He's the Johnny Depp of magic.

275
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:20,727
I saw him in Vegas.
He made a Ferrari disappear.

276
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:22,247
Why would anybody want to do that?
Yeah,

277
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:24,341
he's in town. I saw him
perform a couple of weeks ago.

278
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:26,445
Awesome, awesome show.

279
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,795
Yeah, we loved it.

280
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:28,753
We?

281
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:30,959
Yeah.

282
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:32,522
Me and my buddy.

283
00:12:32,966 --> 00:12:35,927
Ray.
You have a buddy named Ray

284
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:37,404
who you went with to a magic show?

285
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:39,726
Yeah. What about it?
Okay, guys,

286
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:41,950
hold Chuck on an explosives
trafficking charge,

287
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:44,512
and let's see if this "Johnny
Depp of magic" knows what his

288
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,978
trick designer was really into
and why it required so much C4.

289
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:52,774
Voilã .

290
00:12:55,577 --> 00:12:56,631
Pull it tight.

291
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:58,080
All the way.

292
00:12:58,081 --> 00:12:59,589
Make sure it's locked.

293
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:02,474
Okay, guys, 30 seconds,

294
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,715
starting now.

295
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:10,326
Excuse me.

296
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:13,396
Oh, my God!

297
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:14,651
Oh! Get it open!

298
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:21,114
Where is he?
Hey, this is a private rehearsal.

299
00:13:21,115 --> 00:13:22,642
Who the hell let them in here?!

300
00:13:22,643 --> 00:13:24,366
All-access pass.

301
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:26,574
Zalman has been the heart

302
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:28,210
of the New York magic community

303
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:30,453
since he inherited the
shop from his dad.

304
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:34,214
It's a huge loss. I understand
that he worked for you.

305
00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:36,740
He used to.
We parted ways last month.

306
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:38,810
Why?
I heard from one of my vendors

307
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:41,026
that he might be working
for someone else,

308
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:44,147
so I confronted him.
Turns out, he was poached.

309
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:46,096
Do you know by whom?
He didn't say.

310
00:13:46,097 --> 00:13:47,182
Look, Zalman had been

311
00:13:47,183 --> 00:13:50,753
my exclusive designer and
engineer for 15 years.

312
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,536
He created some of my
most famous tricks.

313
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:55,322
If he had any stage presence,

314
00:13:55,323 --> 00:13:58,001
he would've been a
world-class magician himself.

315
00:13:58,076 --> 00:13:59,031
Well, it must have
been very upsetting

316
00:13:59,032 --> 00:14:01,271
to have him leave
after all those years.

317
00:14:02,022 --> 00:14:04,542
Didn't that put some of
your trade secrets at risk?

318
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,969
A thinly veiled accusation,
Mr. Castle.

319
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,610
Of course I was upset.

320
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:10,742
But I never doubted
his discretion.

321
00:14:10,743 --> 00:14:12,262
Mr. Strange,
did any of your illusions

322
00:14:12,263 --> 00:14:15,512
require the use of an explosive?
The term "smoke and mirrors"

323
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:17,968
isn't metaphoric in our
business, detective.

324
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:20,752
Much of misdirection depends
on flashes of light.

325
00:14:20,753 --> 00:14:22,094
What about C4?

326
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:24,817
The key to making
something look dangerous

327
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:27,053
is to have complete
control over the outcome.

328
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:31,017
C4 is too volatile,
unpredictable. It kills.

329
00:14:31,018 --> 00:14:33,008
Any idea what Zalman
would be using it for?

330
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:34,998
Nothing magical, I assure you.

331
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:37,328
Have you checked his workshop?

332
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:40,478
Uh, we haven't come
across a workshop.

333
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:42,461
It's probably where he'd been
disappearing to every day.

334
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:44,003
Do you know where it is?
Ah,

335
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:46,012
you know how magicians
are about secrets.

336
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:48,094
But whatever he was working on,

337
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:49,881
you would probably find there.

338
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:51,356
It's an age-old story...

339
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,939
magician at the top of his game,
angry that his trick designer

340
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,694
has jumped ship for
the competition,

341
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:57,999
kills him instead of

342
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,272
letting his trade secrets
fall into enemy hands.

343
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:02,984
It's magic, Castle,
not the Cold War.

344
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,773
Well, if it's not the Cold War,

345
00:15:04,774 --> 00:15:05,348
why does Zalman need

346
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:07,703
military-grade explosives?
I don't know. Hell.

347
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:09,569
We don't even know if
it really was murder.

348
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,317
For all we know, it could've
actually been a suicide.

349
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,431
It's Lanie. Let me guess.
It wasn't a suicide.

350
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,862
Beckett.

351
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,665
It took you two long enough.
Where were you, Europe?

352
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,209
Traffic. Girl,
you coulda used the gum ball.

353
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,119
Dressed to the nines,
in a big hurry.

354
00:15:31,313 --> 00:15:33,969
So... where are you going
and who's the lucky victim?

355
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,488
I'll tell you what, Castle,

356
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:38,192
you tell me what's going
on between you and Gina,

357
00:15:38,193 --> 00:15:39,880
and I'll tell you where
I'm going tonight.

358
00:15:39,881 --> 00:15:41,459
What are you talking about?

359
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,763
He and his girlfriend had
a big fight at Le Cirque.

360
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:46,003
It was in the paper.
Can we talk about the victim, please?

361
00:15:46,004 --> 00:15:46,985
Okay.

362
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,912
No water in the lungs.

363
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:51,143
He wasn't drowned?

364
00:15:51,144 --> 00:15:52,425
Nope, but he was asphyxiated,

365
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:54,861
which sometimes
presents the same way.

366
00:15:56,493 --> 00:16:00,138
Bruising. Like someone held their
hand over his nose and mouth.

367
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:02,289
He was murdered before
he was put into the tank.

368
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,969
And then his killer
took what he thought

369
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,259
was a blank piece of paper and
typed out the suicide note.

370
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,690
But why kill him that way?

371
00:16:07,691 --> 00:16:09,707
I mean, why make it look like a suicide?
Cover up the murder.

372
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:13,055
The murder, or something bigger

373
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,043
involving explosives?

374
00:16:16,814 --> 00:16:18,579
We gotta find that workshop.

375
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:27,931
You are the picture of a
civilized evening at home.

376
00:16:27,932 --> 00:16:29,835
And you are a caveman.

377
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:31,302
Darling, we are your family.

378
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:33,324
Why didn't you tell us about this?

379
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,075
Have you spoken to her,
you know, since your P.D.A.?

380
00:16:36,076 --> 00:16:37,947
My... public display of anger.

381
00:16:37,948 --> 00:16:40,645
It says you were fighting, dad.
What about?

382
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:43,620
Well, if you must know... yes.

383
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:47,010
We were fighting about how
much we've been fighting.

384
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:48,804
If you don't mind, I'd really like

385
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:52,075
to change the subject.

386
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,170
What am I, 6?

387
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,508
At least pull out a $20.
Wow.

388
00:17:00,175 --> 00:17:02,770
Hey, I was thinking...
Come on, Castle. Keep up.

389
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,439
Where are we going?
Zalman's workshop.

390
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,967
You found it? How?

391
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:09,838
In his soggy wallet
was a soggy metrocard.

392
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,225
Ryan ran it through the
automated fare database.

393
00:17:12,226 --> 00:17:15,435
He was traveling from a subway
stop near his magic shop

394
00:17:15,436 --> 00:17:17,251
to the last stop out in the Bronx.

395
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:18,468
So we're canvassing
the neighborhood.

396
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:20,628
Do we need vests?
No, no vests.

397
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:22,440
Remember that power outage
a couple of weeks ago,

398
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,502
shut down the subway?
Yes.

399
00:17:23,503 --> 00:17:25,469
Well, I looked into
Zalman's financials.

400
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,990
He hired a town car that
day with his credit card,

401
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:30,914
and we now have his address.

402
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:42,766
You sure this is the place?

403
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:44,459
This is where they
dropped him off.

404
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:47,779
Well, it looks abandoned,
bricked up.

405
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,215
Look, look, look.

406
00:17:49,216 --> 00:17:50,229
Footprints.

407
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:52,140
Yes, to nowhere.

408
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:55,625
That's what he wanted us to think.

409
00:18:00,052 --> 00:18:01,741
Open Sesame.

410
00:18:10,113 --> 00:18:12,297
Zalman's fortress of solitude.

411
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:20,957
Wow, Castle.

412
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:23,351
My grandfather would've
loved this place.

413
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,324
Look, he has a guillotine...

414
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:29,789
And an iron maiden.

415
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:32,835
He even had a zig zag box.

416
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,291
You know, you would've
liked my grandfather.

417
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,873
In fact, you remind
me of him a little.

418
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:42,255
I'm flattered.
Hmm.

419
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:48,378
Wheelchair tracks?

420
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:50,670
Yeah, and they look fairly fresh.

421
00:18:51,193 --> 00:18:52,572
Maybe he had a visitor.

422
00:18:52,573 --> 00:18:53,488
Mm-hmm.

423
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:56,733
They look recent.

424
00:18:57,835 --> 00:19:00,381
These papers are dated
the day he was killed.

425
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:03,719
I'm gonna have to get C.S.U.
to sweep this whole place.

426
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:09,069
Is this an accident or art?

427
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,646
Castle, take a look at this.

428
00:19:17,474 --> 00:19:18,892
The pages are ripped,

429
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:21,514
like he didn't want anyone to
know what he was working on.

430
00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:26,579
Zalman?

431
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,496
Who the hell are you?

432
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,696
Best trick ever.

433
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:43,395
NYPD. Keep your hands
where I can see them.

434
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:46,278
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

435
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,372
What... what's going on?
What are you doing here?

436
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:49,970
Zalman?

437
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:53,607
Edmund. Edmund Drake.
His brother from Poughkeepsie?

438
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:55,300
You're a twin.
Yeah.

439
00:19:57,256 --> 00:19:59,940
Can I put my hands down?
Uh, yeah.

440
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:02,797
Why were you hiding
in the iron maiden?

441
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:04,848
It's the entrance
from the other room.

442
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:07,454
I'm detective Beckett.
We're here about your brother.

443
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:10,236
So am I.
Where is he?

444
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:11,429
You don't know?

445
00:20:12,353 --> 00:20:14,431
Mr. Drake, I'm sorry to tell you,

446
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:16,165
but your brother is dead.

447
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:22,621
Are you kidding me?

448
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:25,879
He has an identical
twin who wears glasses.

449
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,049
That's the worst disguise since
Clark Kent, and you believe him?

450
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,224
I have no reason not to.
Look at him. He's devastated.

451
00:20:32,225 --> 00:20:34,950
It's an act. Don't you
ever go to movies?

452
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:36,241
It's...

453
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:38,740
It's probably Edmund who's dead,

454
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:40,123
and that dweeb in the
next room is Zalman.

455
00:20:40,124 --> 00:20:43,257
I bet he killed his brother
to take over his life.

456
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:46,240
As an accountant in Poughkeepsie?

457
00:20:47,005 --> 00:20:47,985
Well, I...

458
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,123
I knew something was wrong

459
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:54,215
when he called me a
couple of days ago.

460
00:20:54,216 --> 00:20:55,711
What did he call about?

461
00:20:56,627 --> 00:20:57,541
Money.

462
00:20:58,057 --> 00:20:59,951
He said someone was paying
him a half a million dollars,

463
00:20:59,952 --> 00:21:03,213
and he needed my help to hide it.
Hide it how?

464
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:04,781
To make sure that the
government never found out

465
00:21:04,782 --> 00:21:06,066
where it came from.

466
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,599
The way he was talking,
it sounded like

467
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,736
he'd gotten involved
in something illegal.

468
00:21:09,737 --> 00:21:12,128
And what were you doing
at his warehouse?

469
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:14,137
Well, I just had this
feeling yesterday

470
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,783
that something was terribly wrong,

471
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:18,389
and when I tried to reach him,
I couldn't.

472
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:21,120
I drove down to the city.
I think it was the twin thing.

473
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:24,811
You know, all our lives,
we've had this connection.

474
00:21:24,812 --> 00:21:27,024
Yeah, of course.
The twin thing.

475
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:29,064
Tell me, Mr. Drake,

476
00:21:29,397 --> 00:21:30,879
given your legacy,

477
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:33,808
why didn't you ever get into
the family business, too?

478
00:21:33,951 --> 00:21:37,226
No, I didn't have the passion...
Or the skill.

479
00:21:37,718 --> 00:21:39,219
Zalman and I, we, uh,

480
00:21:39,935 --> 00:21:42,955
we did have an act
together as kids.

481
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:51,238
He would disappear up on stage,

482
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:54,485
and then... then I would appear
in the back of the audience.

483
00:21:54,797 --> 00:21:55,694
I guess it was only amazing

484
00:21:55,695 --> 00:21:58,261
to people who didn't
know we were twins.

485
00:21:58,262 --> 00:22:00,483
Well, you're being modest.

486
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,587
I'm sure you fooled
a lot of people.

487
00:22:03,518 --> 00:22:06,867
Mr. Drake, the activities that
your brother was involved in,

488
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:09,124
if you looked through
his things, do you think

489
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,480
that you would be able to
determine what he was doing?

490
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:12,871
Zalman was a brilliant engineer,

491
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:16,750
and, uh, I'm afraid my brain
just doesn't work that way.

492
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:18,598
He was someone special, you know?

493
00:22:19,086 --> 00:22:20,212
Light up a room.

494
00:22:21,384 --> 00:22:23,046
Look, detective, I don't
know what he got mixed up in.

495
00:22:23,047 --> 00:22:26,199
But I just know,
he didn't deserve to die.

496
00:22:30,503 --> 00:22:32,231
I can't believe you're letting
him just walk out of here.

497
00:22:32,232 --> 00:22:34,222
If this was a movie...
It's not a movie,

498
00:22:34,223 --> 00:22:36,589
and what am I supposed
to charge him with,

499
00:22:36,865 --> 00:22:37,700
being a twin?

500
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:40,169
Being an evil twin
in a magic murder.

501
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,501
A half-a-million-dollar
payment that he's hiding

502
00:22:42,502 --> 00:22:45,576
from the government, bricks of C4?

503
00:22:45,577 --> 00:22:47,990
That doesn't sound
like magic to me.

504
00:22:49,925 --> 00:22:50,620
Beckett.

505
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:53,224
C.S.U. is just finishing
their initial sweep.

506
00:22:53,268 --> 00:22:54,853
So far we haven't been
able to find anything

507
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:56,988
to indicate who Zalman
might have been working for

508
00:22:56,989 --> 00:22:58,858
other than Tobias Strange,

509
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:02,285
but C.S.U. did find some trace
residue of C4 explosives

510
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:03,372
on the workbench.

511
00:23:03,373 --> 00:23:04,844
And what about the tracks?

512
00:23:04,845 --> 00:23:08,058
You were right.
They are from a wheelchair.

513
00:23:08,175 --> 00:23:09,620
The tracks are pretty distinctive.

514
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,262
We're running down make and model now.
Yeah, well, with any luck,

515
00:23:12,263 --> 00:23:14,936
Professor X will turn out to
be Zalman's mystery client.

516
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:16,205
Right. Thanks.

517
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,648
What about this?
Zalman gets in over his head,

518
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,032
he lures his brother down here,

519
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,482
suffocates him,
sticks him in a tank

520
00:23:23,483 --> 00:23:25,056
so it looks like he's dead.

521
00:23:25,057 --> 00:23:29,588
Meanwhile, Zalman, as Edmund,
inherits his own magic shop

522
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:32,077
collects his own insurance,
all the while

523
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,085
takes Edmund's wife and children,

524
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:35,981
who love him, as his own.

525
00:23:37,398 --> 00:23:39,626
It's "dead ringer."
Are you still talking?

526
00:23:39,749 --> 00:23:41,114
Edmund is Zalman.

527
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:42,637
Couldn't be more wrong.

528
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:45,595
I ran the prints on our victim.
He is Zalman.

529
00:23:45,774 --> 00:23:47,990
Satisfied, Castle?
More like disappointed.

530
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:50,276
Well, maybe this
will cheer you up.

531
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,416
Old man hair.

532
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:53,590
White rabbit fur.

533
00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:55,314
It came from his teeth and throat.

534
00:23:55,315 --> 00:23:57,475
So he was killed by a rabbit

535
00:23:57,476 --> 00:23:59,553
who did not want to be
pulled out of a hat.

536
00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:01,073
Your guess is as good as mine.

537
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:02,634
In the process of
trying to determine

538
00:24:02,635 --> 00:24:05,081
how Zalman was asphyxiated,
I also discovered

539
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:07,743
the presence of a low
dose of organophosphates

540
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:09,190
in his nose and throat.

541
00:24:09,191 --> 00:24:10,661
Organophosphates?

542
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:13,414
It's found in hydraulic fluids,
jet engine oil,

543
00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:16,371
insecticides, nerve agents.
Nerve agents?

544
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,347
Well, along with the C4,

545
00:24:17,348 --> 00:24:18,081
our magician's sounding

546
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:20,513
more like a terrorist.
The amount is too small

547
00:24:20,514 --> 00:24:22,864
to indicate that he had been
working with them directly,

548
00:24:22,865 --> 00:24:26,254
- but he definitely was exposed
to them recently. - Oye, chica.

549
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:27,100
I was in the hood, and I

550
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:29,515
thought that we should
talk about the... tests...

551
00:24:30,224 --> 00:24:31,209
That you had me run.

552
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,585
Um, they're in the back.
I'll go get 'em.

553
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:37,648
Yeah. Thanks.
What tests?

554
00:24:37,649 --> 00:24:40,246
Different case.
Hey, I was just about to call you.

555
00:24:40,274 --> 00:24:41,209
You know those wheelchair tracks

556
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,700
that you found at
Zalman's workshop?

557
00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:44,034
Well, they had a sawtooth pattern

558
00:24:44,035 --> 00:24:47,039
unique to one brand of tire
made for electric wheelchairs.

559
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,574
We called the half a
dozen specialty shops

560
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:50,750
that stock that tire,
and we cross referenced

561
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:52,536
recent purchases
with the mailing list

562
00:24:52,537 --> 00:24:54,443
of the magic shop.
Did you get a match?

563
00:24:54,444 --> 00:24:59,020
Yeah. Thaddeus Magnus.

564
00:24:59,021 --> 00:25:00,987
He's a professional
government protestor.

565
00:25:00,988 --> 00:25:02,927
He's got multiple arrests
for civil disobediences,

566
00:25:02,928 --> 00:25:05,494
and get this...
he drives a white van.

567
00:25:05,495 --> 00:25:07,306
Government protestor,
civil disobedience.

568
00:25:07,307 --> 00:25:09,785
You mix that in with
C4 and nerve agent,

569
00:25:09,786 --> 00:25:13,470
you're looking at Tim McVeigh.
You have an address?

570
00:25:14,507 --> 00:25:15,527
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

571
00:25:15,528 --> 00:25:16,445
Nice work.

572
00:25:19,744 --> 00:25:21,234
That... was close.

573
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:23,025
No. This...

574
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,203
Is close.

575
00:25:29,248 --> 00:25:30,190
How does a guy in a wheelchair

576
00:25:30,191 --> 00:25:32,578
lift someone into a tank of water?

577
00:25:34,677 --> 00:25:37,842
Mr. Magnus, NYPD. Open up.

578
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:40,354
Maybe the wheelchair is an act.

579
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,797
In every magic story,
there's an unexpected twist

580
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:45,393
where things aren't
always what they seem.

581
00:25:45,394 --> 00:25:47,009
It's an obligation of the genre.

582
00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:49,892
What?
NYPD.

583
00:25:49,893 --> 00:25:52,650
We need to ask you a few
questions about Zalman Drake.

584
00:25:53,423 --> 00:25:54,986
Zalman Drake

585
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,805
of Drake Magic.

586
00:25:58,336 --> 00:26:00,147
End of an era.

587
00:26:01,497 --> 00:26:02,995
I hear it was a failed escape.

588
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:05,785
More like a successful murder.
Oh?

589
00:26:05,786 --> 00:26:08,926
He was asphyxiated before he
was lowered into the tank.

590
00:26:09,224 --> 00:26:10,809
You mean he was really murdered?

591
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,833
And guess whose van was
spotted outside his shop

592
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:15,187
right about when he died.

593
00:26:15,188 --> 00:26:17,604
Would you just not touch that, please?
Who wants the ball?

594
00:26:17,605 --> 00:26:19,648
It took me five years to build it.

595
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,807
What was he working on for you?

596
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:24,530
What were the explosives for?
Explosives?

597
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:26,256
What are you talking about?

598
00:26:26,613 --> 00:26:29,720
Look, Zalman was my friend.

599
00:26:30,164 --> 00:26:31,256
He didn't work for me.

600
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:34,745
I worked for him,
making specialty items

601
00:26:34,746 --> 00:26:36,234
for those tricks he designed.

602
00:26:36,235 --> 00:26:38,609
Nothing explosive.

603
00:26:38,818 --> 00:26:41,449
Just... well, things like that.

604
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,896
Doesn't change the fact,

605
00:26:42,897 --> 00:26:44,328
you were at his
store when he died.

606
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:47,040
Does it look like I could've
lifted him into a tank?

607
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,148
Well, maybe you
borrowed a set of legs.

608
00:26:49,294 --> 00:26:51,923
Maybe these or someone else's.
Stop it.

609
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,989
If anyone killed him, it was those guys he met.
What guys?

610
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,876
The guys he was working for.

611
00:26:58,198 --> 00:27:00,110
I was there at the
warehouse when they called.

612
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:02,941
I went there to pick up a check
for some work I did on the job.

613
00:27:02,942 --> 00:27:05,424
They wanted to meet him.

614
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:08,749
Told him to go to the
store after closing.

615
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:12,436
Zalman... asked me
to drop him off.

616
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:15,387
Next thing I hear, he's dead.

617
00:27:15,745 --> 00:27:17,657
I didn't know it was murder.

618
00:27:17,658 --> 00:27:20,301
The job that you did for him,
what was it?

619
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,649
Well, he wanted me to
make him a mechanical arm.

620
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,618
You know, something to
trigger a switch remotely.

621
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:27,301
Theoretically,
what could it trigger?

622
00:27:27,302 --> 00:27:30,132
Well, anything...
turn on a light, ring a bell.

623
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:31,745
Set off a bomb?

624
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:35,878
Oh, look, I swear,
I thought he was joking.

625
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:37,458
About what?

626
00:27:37,463 --> 00:27:40,444
He said this was his
greatest magic trick ever.

627
00:27:40,936 --> 00:27:43,163
Said he was getting paid a fortune

628
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:45,091
to get away with murder.

629
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:56,747
You really think someone
would hire a magician

630
00:27:56,748 --> 00:27:59,137
to help them get away with murder?
I mean, it's brilliant really.

631
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:01,618
Magicians are masters
at misdirection.

632
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:03,122
If they can manipulate audiences,

633
00:28:03,123 --> 00:28:05,168
they can manipulate witnesses.

634
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:06,665
They could even
make people testify

635
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:09,057
to things that never happened.
It's just so hard to believe

636
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:11,088
that a person with that
much respect for magic

637
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,530
would use his skills to kill.
He needed to save his shop,

638
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:16,427
and a half-a-million-dollar
payday was too good to be true.

639
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,570
And it was. Instead of a payday,
he got whacked.

640
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,286
Well, the people who hired
him probably figured

641
00:28:20,287 --> 00:28:22,574
it was safer to kill
him than run the risk

642
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,309
of having an attack of
conscience and rat them out.

643
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,982
Okay, so without evidence,
how are we gonna find 'em?

644
00:28:27,983 --> 00:28:31,180
By finding out exactly who
they hired Zalman to kill.

645
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:33,001
We know he was working on a trick

646
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:36,150
involving C4 and a
remote triggering device.

647
00:28:36,151 --> 00:28:38,175
Well, whoever he killed
went out with a bang.

648
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:39,696
There can't have
been that many deaths

649
00:28:39,697 --> 00:28:41,592
in the tristate area in
the last couple of weeks

650
00:28:41,593 --> 00:28:43,809
where someone was
killed by an explosion.

651
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,672
Where are we with ATF
and the fire department?

652
00:28:45,673 --> 00:28:47,159
We're supposed to get their
reports in the morning.

653
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,880
Okay, meantime, let's see
what we can dig up ourselves.

654
00:28:54,418 --> 00:28:55,970
You know how many
explosions there are

655
00:28:55,971 --> 00:28:58,706
in New York City every week?

656
00:28:58,707 --> 00:29:00,608
Steam pipe explodes.

657
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,005
Gas stove explodes.

658
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:05,341
Unhappy couple explodes.

659
00:29:06,164 --> 00:29:07,944
Well, didn't you explode in
a rather ritzy restaurant

660
00:29:07,945 --> 00:29:09,077
with, uh...

661
00:29:09,078 --> 00:29:11,812
Aha. Speak of the devil.

662
00:29:15,946 --> 00:29:17,286
You're not gonna answer that?

663
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:24,116
Answer what?
Ooh. Well done.

664
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:25,928
Of course, making
your phone disappear

665
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:28,486
doesn't make your
problem disappear.

666
00:29:28,487 --> 00:29:29,452
No.

667
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,470
Hey, come on, kiddo.

668
00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:34,350
What's going on with
you two, really?

669
00:29:34,351 --> 00:29:35,482
Nothing's going on.

670
00:29:36,057 --> 00:29:38,309
No, nothing at all.
Everything is fine.

671
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:39,564
Everything is...

672
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,747
Just fine.

673
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,428
It's ordinary.

674
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,956
The problem is, I...

675
00:29:47,472 --> 00:29:48,876
I don't want ordinary.

676
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,444
I want...

677
00:29:50,445 --> 00:29:51,465
Magic.

678
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:55,721
Yeah. You know what
the problem is,

679
00:29:56,276 --> 00:29:57,802
is we just aren't in love.

680
00:29:57,997 --> 00:30:00,041
Neither one of us
wants to admit...

681
00:30:02,014 --> 00:30:04,344
Organophosphates.

682
00:30:06,614 --> 00:30:08,869
It wasn't a nerve agent.
It was jet oil.

683
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,613
Zalman was at an airport.
What? I...

684
00:30:11,614 --> 00:30:12,597
I gotta go.

685
00:30:13,903 --> 00:30:15,707
Now you see him, now you don't.

686
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:18,921
Hey. I think I figured out
who Zalman was paid to kill.

687
00:30:18,922 --> 00:30:21,177
Billionaire philanthropist
Christian Dahl?

688
00:30:21,178 --> 00:30:22,317
How did you...

689
00:30:24,028 --> 00:30:26,583
Organophosphates,
jet oil, airport.

690
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:28,843
It's like we could be twins.

691
00:30:29,095 --> 00:30:30,253
Connection.

692
00:30:30,254 --> 00:30:31,362
Conjecture.

693
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:32,974
All we know right now is that Dahl

694
00:30:32,975 --> 00:30:34,759
took off from Teterboro
Saturday afternoon

695
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,253
intending to set a transatlantic
speed record in his jet.

696
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:39,254
Apparently, something went wrong,

697
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:40,907
and the plane broke up midair.

698
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:43,173
Witnesses out on an oil tanker
out on Long Island sound

699
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,814
claim to have seen a white
flash and smoke in the sky.

700
00:30:45,815 --> 00:30:47,381
Well, a midair explosion

701
00:30:47,382 --> 00:30:49,662
would account for all the C4
that Zalman bought from Chuck.

702
00:30:49,663 --> 00:30:51,765
And Magnus' remote
triggering device.

703
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,111
Well, whoever wanted
Christian dead

704
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:54,583
probably killed Zalman
to cover up the crime.

705
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:57,068
Except all we have
now is speculation.

706
00:30:57,069 --> 00:30:59,567
Yo. I just got off with the F.A.A.

707
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:01,683
They're sending over
footage of the takeoff.

708
00:31:05,623 --> 00:31:07,876
Okay, there's Dahl
getting on his jet

709
00:31:07,877 --> 00:31:10,290
for the transatlantic
flight attempt.

710
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:13,195
Looks like he's
doing his preflight.

711
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:15,821
Look at that.

712
00:31:15,822 --> 00:31:18,818
It matches the outline on the
wall in Zalman's workshop.

713
00:31:19,663 --> 00:31:21,507
He was painting a decal.

714
00:31:23,775 --> 00:31:25,268
Zoom in on that guy.

715
00:31:27,543 --> 00:31:28,822
It's Zalman Drake.

716
00:31:30,317 --> 00:31:32,130
He dressed like a caterer.

717
00:31:32,131 --> 00:31:34,135
Probably so he can
get past security.

718
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:39,411
He delivered something.
Yeah, explosives and a triggering device.

719
00:31:39,412 --> 00:31:41,151
This was a murder for hire.

720
00:31:41,748 --> 00:31:42,871
Skip ahead.

721
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:44,902
And freeze it.

722
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,014
He planned for
Christian Dahl's plane

723
00:31:46,015 --> 00:31:47,606
to break up over the Atlantic.

724
00:31:47,607 --> 00:31:49,756
It's the perfect crime...
No evidence...

725
00:31:49,757 --> 00:31:51,526
No body... no killer.

726
00:31:57,904 --> 00:32:00,154
You are crazy. I've never
even tried anything like...

727
00:32:00,155 --> 00:32:03,160
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, me, too. Bye.
Who was that?

728
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:05,434
Coast guard. I was just
seeing if they, uh,

729
00:32:05,435 --> 00:32:07,272
found the plane's data recorder.
Hmm. Did they?

730
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:10,956
Did they what?
Hey, guys, where are you on Christian Dahl?

731
00:32:11,072 --> 00:32:13,130
This guy was unbelievable.

732
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,618
He became a billionaire
by always being exactly

733
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:18,373
in the right place at exactly
the right time to invest

734
00:32:18,374 --> 00:32:21,469
in whatever stock, product or
idea was just about to hit.

735
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,774
Did he have any enemies,
anyone that was threatening him?

736
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,440
No, all the people I
talked to loved him.

737
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:27,130
He gave away more
money than Oprah,

738
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:28,287
and he gave a lot of money

739
00:32:28,288 --> 00:32:30,681
to research into the occult.
He climbed Everest,

740
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,687
he flew across Europe
in a hot air balloon,

741
00:32:32,688 --> 00:32:34,935
he even drove a dog
sled in the iditarod.

742
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:36,220
Well, with that
much going for him,

743
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,598
he had to have had
a couple of haters.

744
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:42,742
Just one, and she had both
motive and opportunity.

745
00:32:44,906 --> 00:32:45,768
Naomi Weldon?

746
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:47,506
Naomi Weldon Dahl...

747
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:51,345
Christian's wife and a
former fashion model.

748
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:52,778
Apparently, a month ago,

749
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:54,586
Christian caught her
having an affair,

750
00:32:54,587 --> 00:32:57,283
and according to their prenup,
if he divorced her,

751
00:32:57,284 --> 00:32:58,397
she wound up with nothing.

752
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:01,426
And if he dies,
she inherits billions.

753
00:33:01,427 --> 00:33:04,083
Where was this photo taken?
Ah, you noticed.

754
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:06,782
The Dahl Foundation
benefit six weeks ago.

755
00:33:06,783 --> 00:33:10,030
And the entertainment for the
evening was... Zalman Drake.

756
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:10,722
You know, Jerome did say

757
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:12,348
Zalman made someone
disappear that night.

758
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:13,896
Naomi sees his performance

759
00:33:13,897 --> 00:33:16,927
and wonders if Zalman can make
her husband disappear forever.

760
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,475
And with billions on the line...

761
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:20,165
Half a million's
just chump change.

762
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,068
When they told me that
Christian's plane disappeared,

763
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:23,300
that's exactly what I thought.

764
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,977
That your husband's
death was no accident?

765
00:33:25,978 --> 00:33:29,414
Christian was a perfectionist,
and he was superstitious.

766
00:33:29,415 --> 00:33:31,988
He did three background
checks before he married me.

767
00:33:32,588 --> 00:33:33,539
You and your husband had

768
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:36,240
an airtight prenuptial agreement.

769
00:33:36,372 --> 00:33:38,894
Standard when two
high-profile people marry.

770
00:33:38,895 --> 00:33:41,382
And if you left the
marriage or had an affair,

771
00:33:41,383 --> 00:33:42,797
you'd be leaving the marriage

772
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:45,191
without spousal or child support.

773
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:46,675
Those were the terms.

774
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,965
I have my own career.
I can take care of myself.

775
00:33:49,966 --> 00:33:51,606
But you were having an affair.

776
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:55,115
Whether or not I had an
affair is none of your affair.

777
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,423
If you're implying that
I murdered my husband

778
00:33:57,424 --> 00:34:00,009
to be with someone else,
you're mistaken.

779
00:34:00,052 --> 00:34:03,297
I wouldn't kill anyone.
Not even to inherit a fortune?

780
00:34:04,163 --> 00:34:06,127
Well, then the joke
would be on me.

781
00:34:06,189 --> 00:34:07,800
There is no fortune.

782
00:34:07,892 --> 00:34:10,205
All of Christian's
accounts have been frozen.

783
00:34:10,206 --> 00:34:11,289
You mean you're in probate.

784
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,549
No, I mean frozen.
Why?

785
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,382
You'll have to ask the
district attorney's office.

786
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:19,327
God knows, they wouldn't tell me.

787
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:21,681
That was the D.A.

788
00:34:21,682 --> 00:34:23,409
Apparently,
at the time of his death,

789
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,707
our billionaire investment guru

790
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:27,474
was being investigated
by the S.E.C.

791
00:34:27,475 --> 00:34:29,131
They thought that he
was making his money

792
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:31,898
the old-fashioned way,
by stealing it.

793
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:34,866
All of his amazing stock
returns were falsified.

794
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:36,757
The whole thing was
a Ponzi scheme.

795
00:34:36,758 --> 00:34:38,778
As it turns out,
they were a couple of weeks away

796
00:34:38,779 --> 00:34:41,979
from indicting Christian
Dahl for massive fraud.

797
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,433
He was gonna lose everything

798
00:34:43,434 --> 00:34:46,302
and face 50 years
in federal prison.

799
00:34:46,303 --> 00:34:47,288
If I were him,
I'd want to disappear,

800
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:49,802
too. And what better
way to disappear...

801
00:34:49,803 --> 00:34:52,080
Than hire a magician?
Bingo.

802
00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:55,146
Christian Dahl is on the plane
doing his preflight check.

803
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,410
Zalman leaves the plane...

804
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,428
Dahl taxis to the
runway and takes off.

805
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:02,017
Well, he had to have
gotten off at some point,

806
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:03,992
otherwise, it would've
been a suicide mission,

807
00:35:03,993 --> 00:35:05,901
and you don't need a
magician for that.

808
00:35:07,896 --> 00:35:08,924
Unless...

809
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:13,185
That isn't Christian Dahl.

810
00:35:13,186 --> 00:35:16,221
It looks just like him.
Dummy.

811
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:19,139
Not you.
The... on... in the cockpit.

812
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,263
They switched out real
Dahl for dummy Dahl.

813
00:35:21,264 --> 00:35:24,209
Magnus didn't build a triggering
device for an explosion.

814
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,320
The arm he built was for
doing the preflight check.

815
00:35:26,321 --> 00:35:28,826
The whole thing's an automaton.
That's the magic trick.

816
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:30,549
He made it look to the
world like Christian Dahl

817
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,949
was still on the plane,
the same way Tobias Strange made it look

818
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,252
like he was still
in the cabinet when

819
00:35:34,253 --> 00:35:36,180
the swords went in.
And then he used the catering box

820
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:39,392
to get the dummy on board
and Christian Dahl off.

821
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:41,252
Then who's piloting that plane?

822
00:35:41,253 --> 00:35:44,327
Christian Dahl,
only not from the cockpit.

823
00:35:44,328 --> 00:35:47,283
He had it rigged to fly
via remote control. See?

824
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,717
Zalman puts the box in the van.

825
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:50,422
There's probably a
console inside there

826
00:35:50,423 --> 00:35:53,102
linked to the plane's avionics.
Dahl takes off remotely...

827
00:35:53,103 --> 00:35:54,421
Flies out over the Atlantic...

828
00:35:54,422 --> 00:35:55,774
And then he detonates
the explosion,

829
00:35:55,775 --> 00:35:57,199
and everyone thinks that he's dead

830
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,926
because everyone's
seen him on board.

831
00:35:58,927 --> 00:36:01,046
Only Dahl is very much alive,

832
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:03,342
and there's only one person
in the world that knows it.

833
00:36:03,343 --> 00:36:05,735
Zalman, and as long as he's alive,
he's a threat to Dahl.

834
00:36:05,736 --> 00:36:07,733
So Dahl has to tie up
that one loose end.

835
00:36:07,734 --> 00:36:10,600
But he can't risk anyone
knowing that he's still alive.

836
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,971
So Dahl has to kill
Zalman himself.

837
00:36:18,198 --> 00:36:19,140
What?

838
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:22,890
Nothing. So what do we do now?

839
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:26,403
Well, it's four days
since the accident.

840
00:36:26,404 --> 00:36:28,687
Christian Dahl is probably in
some non-extradition country

841
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:30,243
with a chunk of his
fortune by now.

842
00:36:30,244 --> 00:36:31,617
Yeah, probably.

843
00:36:33,174 --> 00:36:34,162
Unless...

844
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:35,799
Unless what?

845
00:36:36,508 --> 00:36:38,299
Well, Dahl does
everything publicly.

846
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,387
The guy loves being famous.
Everyone thinks he's dead.

847
00:36:40,388 --> 00:36:44,137
A guy like that...
No, it's crazy.

848
00:36:44,387 --> 00:36:47,025
Castle, crazy is exactly
what we need right now.

849
00:36:54,097 --> 00:36:57,464
Castle, this is crazy.
Crazy but in character.

850
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,383
Look at the kind of guy
Christian Dahl was...

851
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,944
How he loved the limelight,

852
00:37:00,945 --> 00:37:02,897
his fascination with
life after death.

853
00:37:02,898 --> 00:37:04,921
You think a guy like that is
gonna miss the opportunity

854
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,579
to attend his own funeral?

855
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,881
Would you?
Not a chance.

856
00:37:09,868 --> 00:37:12,438
Okay, so if he's here,
how do we find him?

857
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:15,011
Well, he'll be in disguise,
of course.

858
00:37:15,638 --> 00:37:17,091
Look for an anomaly,

859
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:21,394
someone who's trying to fit in
yet sticking to the outskirts,

860
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,111
someone who isn't
engaging in conversation

861
00:37:24,112 --> 00:37:25,492
but at the same time,

862
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,444
eavesdropping on other
people's conversations.

863
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:31,111
Someone who's... got long hair,
a beard, and $1,000 shoes?

864
00:37:34,604 --> 00:37:35,873
Yeah, that'll work, too.

865
00:37:37,315 --> 00:37:38,481
Mr. Dahl.

866
00:37:41,899 --> 00:37:43,454
You shoulda stayed dead, bro.

867
00:37:45,395 --> 00:37:46,812
So I faked my own death.

868
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:48,510
So what? That's not a crime.

869
00:37:49,035 --> 00:37:51,704
What are you gonna charge me with,
littering the Atlantic?

870
00:37:51,705 --> 00:37:53,631
I'll stand in line behind B.P.

871
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:56,161
The charge is premeditated murder.

872
00:37:56,162 --> 00:37:57,591
We figured out your little trick.

873
00:37:57,592 --> 00:37:59,208
Zalman performed for
your charity event.

874
00:37:59,209 --> 00:38:01,576
He made you disappear,
giving you the inspiration

875
00:38:01,577 --> 00:38:04,224
to pull the ultimate escape.
You knew he needed money,

876
00:38:04,225 --> 00:38:06,170
so you made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

877
00:38:06,171 --> 00:38:08,968
But you never planned on paying him,
did you, Mr. Dahl?

878
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:11,033
No, you planned on
using his desperation

879
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:13,104
over the loss of
his family's legacy

880
00:38:13,105 --> 00:38:16,193
to make people think that
he committed suicide.

881
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:18,197
Staging a shooting,
it's too cumbersome.

882
00:38:18,198 --> 00:38:20,682
Too many questions.
Where'd the gun come from?

883
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:23,482
So you used what you had
on hand to get rid of

884
00:38:23,483 --> 00:38:26,091
the only person on earth who
knew you were still alive.

885
00:38:26,528 --> 00:38:28,671
Once he was gone,
you'd be free and clear.

886
00:38:30,418 --> 00:38:30,992
Is...

887
00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:33,033
Is that what you do when
you can't solve a crime,

888
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:35,021
concoct fantasies?

889
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,244
The rabbit hair that
lined your gloves

890
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:39,174
was found on our victim.

891
00:38:39,689 --> 00:38:41,759
You called Zalman,
met him at his shop,

892
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,952
put your gloved
hand over his mouth,

893
00:38:43,953 --> 00:38:46,037
and then you smothered him.

894
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,542
If you think I'm afraid
of you or the S.E.C...

895
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:55,686
I will beat your pants off and
enjoy every minute of it...

896
00:38:58,521 --> 00:39:02,389
Assuming you can find
me once I'm out on bail.

897
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,265
It's not me that you should
be scared of, Mr. Dahl,

898
00:39:05,266 --> 00:39:07,018
or the S.E.C.

899
00:39:07,682 --> 00:39:10,007
You should be afraid
of what you've become.

900
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:11,553
Well, if you're done
with your lecture

901
00:39:11,554 --> 00:39:13,740
or your petty threats,
I'd like to see my...

902
00:39:18,376 --> 00:39:19,453
My lawyer.

903
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,027
Something wrong, Dahl?

904
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:23,924
No.

905
00:39:26,937 --> 00:39:28,189
Christian?

906
00:39:28,507 --> 00:39:29,342
H...

907
00:39:29,897 --> 00:39:31,197
How are you doing that?

908
00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:34,061
Doing what?

909
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:38,699
Aah!

910
00:39:40,785 --> 00:39:42,700
Is he having flashbacks?
I don't know.

911
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,640
Do you see him?

912
00:39:44,641 --> 00:39:45,519
Who?

913
00:39:45,647 --> 00:39:46,827
He was right here.

914
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,675
Oh, God.

915
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:52,299
You can't... you can't be here.

916
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:54,963
You're dead!

917
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:57,902
You're dead. I...

918
00:40:01,522 --> 00:40:02,559
I killed you.

919
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:12,713
Alakazam, jackass.

920
00:40:19,987 --> 00:40:21,085
How did you know that would work?

921
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,884
I didn't. I just
knew he'd lawyer up.

922
00:40:22,885 --> 00:40:24,688
So I figured, why not take a shot?

923
00:40:25,244 --> 00:40:27,035
Your grandfather would be proud.

924
00:40:27,117 --> 00:40:28,500
Thank you so much, gentlemen.

925
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:31,273
Always a pleasure to
lend a hand to the NYPD.

926
00:40:31,468 --> 00:40:33,648
I might add this one
to my repertoire

927
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:35,432
in tribute to your brother.

928
00:40:36,262 --> 00:40:38,800
Thank you, detective, Mr. Castle.

929
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:40,974
So what's gonna happen
to Drake's Magic Shop?

930
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:43,573
Hmm. Tobias and I
were discussing that.

931
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,497
Zalman put his life
on the line for it,

932
00:40:45,498 --> 00:40:47,557
so we'd like to find a
way to keep it alive.

933
00:40:47,558 --> 00:40:50,198
Maybe we can pull a solution
out of our collective hats.

934
00:40:51,028 --> 00:40:51,484
Good night.

935
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:52,360
Bye.

936
00:40:53,933 --> 00:40:54,865
Hey, could you, uh...

937
00:40:54,866 --> 00:40:55,774
Oh, yeah.

938
00:40:57,153 --> 00:40:59,750
So... where's Esposito?

939
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:02,088
Huh. Take a wild guess.
Lanie?

940
00:41:02,089 --> 00:41:03,847
Can you believe they still
think that none of us know?

941
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:06,674
Oh, let's let 'em keep
thinking that a while longer.

942
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:08,368
The bubble bursts soon enough.

943
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:12,143
Not if you're in it with the right person.
Thanks. Thank you. See you.

944
00:41:17,628 --> 00:41:19,448
Excuse me. I need
to take this. Yeah.

945
00:41:36,932 --> 00:41:38,547
No. No.

946
00:41:38,548 --> 00:41:39,936
What I'm saying is...

947
00:41:41,563 --> 00:41:42,608
It's over.

948
00:41:59,412 --> 00:42:02,135
Heading out?
Yeah. It's late.

949
00:42:02,972 --> 00:42:04,257
Motorcycle boy?

950
00:42:04,771 --> 00:42:07,353
I really wish you would
stop calling him that.

951
00:42:07,354 --> 00:42:10,199
Dr. Motorcycle boy.
He's on shift tonight.

952
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,939
I was gonna see if I could
catch the comfort food truck.

953
00:42:16,174 --> 00:42:17,283
You want to come?

954
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:21,305
Macaroni and cheese,
warm biscuits, hot chocolate?

955
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:22,532
How could I say no?

956
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:26,445
Hey, I wanted to
say thanks for, um,

957
00:42:27,465 --> 00:42:30,261
not mentioning that article
or asking what was going on.

958
00:42:37,441 --> 00:42:38,453
Not a problem.

959
00:42:38,653 --> 00:42:48,853
