00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,420
Oh, she's a beauty.

3
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,860
I mean, look at her.
She's not new, but she looks new.

4
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,980
- He said the engine needed work.
- I could do the engine.

5
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,620
I can't believe he's asking so little.
It's practically a steal.

6
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,220
John Anderson said we could
keep it at his marina free of charge...

7
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,220
at least for a year
till his son comes back.

8
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,420
Oh, here he comes. Don't show you're
too eager or he won't budge on the price.

9
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,020
<i>- All right?
- Right.</i>

10
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,900
Ain't she a beauty? A little work
and she'll be in perfect condition.

11
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,980
Yeah, well, let's face it. It's more
than a little work she needs, isn't it?

12
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,900
What's the best price
you can do us?

13
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,500
- A boat like this is worth every bit of 6,000.
- Six grand? Are you joking?

14
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,180
Six is a bargain. The owner died
and his mum's got to get rid of it fast.

15
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,940
All right, but the engine's done
and the hull needs work as well.

16
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,060
She could be made seaworthy
in no time.

17
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,980
Take a look at the condition she's in.
Practically mint.

18
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,420
Look, we're just working lads.
We don't have this kind of money.

19
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,580
To get a SCOD like this for six
is a once-in-a-lifetime.

20
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,740
- Look, can you give us a minute?
Just give us a minute. Terry.

21
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,100
- What?

22
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,060
There's plenty of others
interested in her if you're not.

23
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,980
I could put in 800. Christ, you break
your back and it's hard to save a penny.

24
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,180
- Where you'd get 800 quid from?
- I won 400 at cards.

25
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,100
- Did you?
- Yeah.

26
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,020
Come on, you got
some savings, Ian.

27
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,420
But I'm trying to get my end
of a business deal up.

28
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,940
I could match your 800, but I promised Dad
I'd take a pay cut 'cause business is so bad.

29
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,140
Bet if Uncle Howard was here
he'd loan it to us.

30
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,980
- Yeah, I thought of that. But he's away.
- They must have phones in China.

31
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,900
- It's like Howard's boat, isn't it?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,860
I mean, it's smaller, but it's so much better
a nick than I thought we could afford.

33
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,580
[Sighs]
Remember when we were kids?

34
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,260
- Uncle Howard bought us that boat in Ireland?
- Oh, yeah.

35
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,540
- What a summer.
- Yeah.

36
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,740
I've got to have this boat.
We could pay it off in installments.

37
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,340
I got four numbers in the lottery
last week. Can you believe four?

38
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,580
- Should we do it? Right.
- Yeah, let's do it.

39
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,940
What the hell do you need a boat for?
And how are you gonna pay for it?

40
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,420
<i>- [Terry] It's secondhand.
- So you're buying someone else's headaches.</i>

41
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,380
No, we're doing an incredible job
fixing it up. You ought to see it.

42
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,340
It's cleaning up like new.

43
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,380
<i>[Man] Pay more attention to the restaurant
and less to dreams of the open sea.</i>

<i>You're a bright boy if your head
wasn't always in the clouds.</i>

45
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,780
I wasn't put on this earth
to run a restaurant.

46
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,460
Remember when Uncle Howard bought me
and Ian that boat when we were kids?

47
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,100
What a summer.

48
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,020
Your Uncle Howard's
opening a clinic in China.

49
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,940
He's studying
the Chinese language.

50
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,820
Can you imagine at his age
learning a hard language like that?

51
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,220
<i>- He's brilliant.
- [Man] I'm unimpressed.</i>

52
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,820
You can't afford to be
unimpressed...

53
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,500
because the man makes more money
in a week than you earn in a year.

54
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,620
He's got clinics in Switzerland
and Hollywood, and now China.

55
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,860
Hollywood's where he belongs. All those phonies
lining up like sheep for his plastic surgery.

56
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,460
Mom, can we have one Sunday lunch
where we don't have this conversation?

57
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,660
Well, puts on airs,
takes himself so seriously.

58
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,020
Could we have afforded this house
without my brother's generosity?

59
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,740
Could we have got by over the years
on his paltry earnings?

60
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,700
I mean, who paid
for the holidays?

61
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,340
<i>Who lent us the money when we needed it,
when he wanted to start his restaurant?</i>

62
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,540
If my bloody partner didn't steal from me-
That's what gave me the heart attack.

63
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,620
Howard started with nothing and he paid
his own way through his medical studies.

64
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,140
<i>And now he's a millionaire
with top-class clients...</i>

65
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,420
<i>and yet he never
forgot his family.</i>

66
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,340
Let that be a lesson to you.

67
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,300
In the end, all you have in this
life that you can count on is family.

68
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,260
And don't you forget it.

69
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,460
- I got us the rest of the money.
- What?

70
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,460
We can pay off the boat. Plus, some left over for
the barometer you wanted to buy for the cabin.

71
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,380
- How?
- Two of my little doggies came in.

72
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,340
- No.
- Yep. First and fifth race, I won both.

73
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,660
We can finish by the weekend. We can
take her out for a maiden voyage Saturday.

74
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,260
What are we going to call her? We have to
call her something if we're taking her out.

75
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,060
- Cassandra's Dream. That
was the 60-to-1 shot I hit.

76
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,140
- 60-to-1?
Terry.

81
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,380
My brother and I bought this
beat-up boat and fixed it up.

82
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,340
We're going out on it tomorrow. And he's taking
his girl and I wondered if you'd like to come?

83
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,500
- Yeah, I'd love to. Sounds good.

just this big bang and it sort of petered out.

143
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,500
Let me have a look.

144
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,740
All right.

145
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,580
<i>- [Clattering]
- [Ian] Yeah.</i>

146
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,420
[Engine Starts]

147
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,260
There you are.
They can be a bit temperamental.

148
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,780
Yeah, I love yours.

149
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,340
Ah, yeah, it's very pretty,
isn't it? I haven't had it long.

150
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,540
Old Jags are so sexy.

151
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,100
- Well, thank you for stopping.
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

152
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,820
- I'm Angela Stark.
- Ian Blaine.

153
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,860
- Do you live around here?
- No. I live in London.

154
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,780
Yeah, me too.
What do you do?

155
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,620
At the moment, I'm in the restaurant
business, but basically, uh, investments.

156
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,820
I owe you one. I'm leaving you
a couple of tickets to my show.

157
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,860
Oh, you're an actress?

158
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,940
- Yeah. What's your name?
- Ian Blaine.

159
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,900
Okay, I'll leave you two tickets
at the Wilton. When do you want to come?

160
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,340
- Uh, Tuesday?
- Fine.

161
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:09,620
Yeah.

162
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,980
Don't forget to come backstage
and tell me how great I am.

163
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,900
All right.

164
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,060
Oh, look, this is Terry
and Ian and my brother Howard.

165
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,180
- Oh, let's see.
- Oh, Howard looks so handsome.

166
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,140
Uh, that was the year Howard took
the boys to see the World Cup match.

167
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,060
I used to be a very good football player.

168
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,980
<i>[Woman]
He was till he broke his leg.</i>

169
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,620
I always hoped Terry would take to it.
You were very good.

170
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,500
He excelled at sports.
I always said you should open a sports shop.

171
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,380
Yeah, but I need financial backing.
Costs a lot to own a shop.

172
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,300
Then you'd be your own boss,
wouldn't you?

173
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,980
Yeah, Terry was athletic
and Ian was-

174
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,180
- The brains, she wants to say. Yeah.
- No.

175
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,100
She thinks I'll be
offended by it. Great.

176
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,220
Everybody predicted
great things for Ian.

177
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,420
- He's so nice-looking and personable.
- Yeah.

178
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,420
Now it's a mystery to me
why he's not more successful.

179
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,460
Because he's not content
with what he has.

180
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,820
He sees himself like Howard,
with a fancy life.

181
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,260
Always got some scheme.
Always waiting for his ship to come in.

182
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,220
Well, his ship won't come in at the restaurant.
He does that out of a son's love for his father.

183
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,780
Like the poet said: " The only ship
certain to come in has black sails."

184
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,900
<i>[Terry]
Go on!</i>

185
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,980
<i>Go on!</i>

186
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,700
<i>Come on! Ahh!</i>

187
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,140
Go on- Ohh! Shit!

188
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,980
Oh, lend us another
couple of hundred.

189
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,940
- That's eight.
- I know. I can count.

190
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,340
- Hello.
- Hello, babe.

191
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,220
- You met me from work.
- Yeah.

192
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,220
- You're too gorgeous.
- I got you something.

193
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,220
- No.
- Go on.

194
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,340
You didn't.
Oh, my God!

195
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,500
- Oh, wow. You're too naughty.
- Do you like it?

196
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,900
- Do I like it? That is beautiful.
- I wanted you to have it.

197
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,260
God. How much is that-
I'm not gonna even ask about the money...

198
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,740
- 'cause I'm sure I know where you got it.
- You wouldn't believe.

199
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,780
- What?
- I was losing at first, and my luck changed.

200
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,380
Oh, yeah?

201
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,020
And I was in over me head, but
sometimes you get the feeling.

202
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,860
I can't even explain it. I know it's not
your birthday, but I thought you'd like it.

203
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,100
Oh, and I'm glad you did.
Oh, it's gorgeous. Thank you.

204
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,500
- You're welcome. How was work?
- Boring. Boring. But look at my bag.

205
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,580
My boyfriend doesn't have to know.

206
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,300
- Know what?
- What we're going to do.

207
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,140
<i>- [Man] What are we going to do?
- [Angela] What do you want to do?</i>

208
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,620
<i>[Man]
It's a very wicked way to cheat Alan.</i>

209
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,220
To deceive him so blatantly.

210
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:45,260
I never said I was nice. In fact, I think
that's why you're so turned on by me.

211
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,660
<i>[Man]
It's one of those nights, you know...</i>

212
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,820
<i>when those elements
just blend to perfection.</i>

213
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,100
<i>- Angela. Uh, you were terrific.
- Oh, hi. Um, Ian.</i>

214
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,780
- Fantastic. You were brilliant.
- Oh, thank you. Oh, well...

215
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,940
the director put in a scene at the last minute
and we were completely thrown off.

216
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,540
- It didn't show. I thought it was great.
- That's very sweet of you.

217
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,860
<i>- All of you, great. Thanks for the tickets.
- Thank you for rescuing me.</i>

218
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,420
I thought the play was brilliant.
You-You were very special in it.

219
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,380
- Special?
- Yeah, special.

220
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,700
Well, you know,
can I take you for a drink?

221
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,460
- On the way. Good.
- See you.

222
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,460
- Still on for Sunday night?
- Yeah, definitely.

223
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,780
- Good. Can't wait.
- Um, sorry. What were you saying?

224
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,620
Uh, just wondered if you
wanted to come for a drink.

225
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,940
Uh, yeah. Sure. I can only stay for one though.
I've got to be up early tomorrow.

226
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,700
I'm doing a film for the BBC.

227
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,460
<i>Does it bother you coming
out nude onstage every night...</i>

228
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,340
- and doing all the kinky sex scenes?
- That's only acting.

229
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,180
I'm not self-conscious
about that sort of thing.

230
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,900
I mean, the whole point of my character
is to create an erotic tension.

231
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,380
You're very convincing.
The audience gets very quiet.

232
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,260
I think it's a very moral play,
don't you think?

233
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,060
- Moral? In what way?
- Well, about evil, about fate.

234
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,100
I'm not an experienced playgoer.

235
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,660
I do think that the writing
is very pessimistic.

236
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,540
And all that stuff about life
being a tragic experience.

237
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,260
I think we make our own fate.
I believe that.

238
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,820
Yeah, I think we make our fate too.

239
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,780
- Helen, this is Ian.
- Hello.

240
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,340
Hi. Ellis Pell asked me
for your phone number.

241
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,020
<i>- And I didn't think you'd mind.
- Mind? Did he say when he might call?</i>

242
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,220
If anything happens, I want the details.
[Chuckles]

243
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,660
Well, I should go. Thank you again
for coming to my aid on the road.

244
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,940
I dreamt about you
the next two nights.

245
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,460
Being rescued is one
of my wicked dreams.

246
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,820
It's not very wicked
being rescued.

247
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,340
It's what you did to me after.

248
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,700
Will I see you again?

249
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,620
Well, you can try
now you know where to find me.

250
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,180
<i>- Oi, Ter.
- Oi, Mike.</i>

251
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,980
You all right?
You got my dough?

252
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,900
Yeah. Hang on a minute.

253
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,140
So I hear you've been
a bit lucky at cards lately.

254
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,900
It's not just cards. Backed
a lot of winners at the dogs.

255
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,300
Oh, yeah?

256
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,220
- You know what my theory is?
- No. Go on.

257
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,900
It comes in streaks. Gotta be willing
to push your luck when it's hot.

258
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,980
Right.

259
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,700
So, uh, what's the most you're
willing to play for then?

260
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,340
What's the most?
I don't know. I'm for real.

261
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,740
I mean, I don't want to wind up
paying people back the rest of my life.

262
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,100
<i>- Vultures like you chasing me for money.
- [Chuckles]</i>

263
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,020
Why'd you ask?

264
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,540
<i>Well, there's a big game every
Friday night at the Alwyn Hotel.</i>

265
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,460
- Do you know it?
- Yeah.

266
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,100
And it's big money, mate. I'm
not sure if you're up for it.

267
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,420
How much?

268
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,820
Well, put it this way, Sammy Bush
walked out with 60 grand last week.

269
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,740
Oh, too rich for my blood.

270
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,900
Well, just thought, seeing as you were flush,
I thought you might be up for it.

271
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,420
- Sixty grand?
- Well, just thought I'd mention it, that's all.

272
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
- All right, Mike.
- I'll let you know about it though, all right?

273
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,420
- All right.
- Be lucky. Don't work too hard, will ya?

274
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,380
Take care.

275
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,780
- Oh, it's lovely.
- Good. I'm glad you like it.

276
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,100
- Yeah, it's gorgeous.
- I do think that, uh, 295 is a pretty good price.

277
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,340
- Well, it's pretty expensive, though, isn't it?
- A lot of money.

278
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,260
It's a rising market.
This is your chance to jump in.

279
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,340
You're first-time buyers.
There's no chain involved.

280
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:57,500
Right.

281
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,500
- You know, you should consider that.
- Right. We will.

282
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,700
- We'll think about it.
- Good. I'll be in the car, yeah?

283
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,220
- All right. Thanks.
- I really like it though. I think it's gorgeous.

284
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,580
- I'm just figuring the cost.
- I can do it.

285
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,780
What I earn at the pub
and your wages, easily, yeah.

286
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,580
I need somewhere to practice me trumpet
without the neighbors complaining.

287
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,020
You can practice anywhere. You don't play
anymore anyway. You and your trumpet.

288
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,180
- You really like it?
- I do. It's got a little garden.

289
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,660
- We'll figure out a way to do it.
- Really? Oh, really?

290
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,460
- Yeah.
- I love it. [Chuckles]

291
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,900
Fifteen thousand.

292
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,460
Fifteen thousand.

293
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,060
No. I'm out.

294
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,100
Yeah, me too.

295
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,180
It's 15,000 to you,
Terry.

296
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,140
Uh...

297
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,420
All right, I'll see ya.

298
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,180
Yeah.

299
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,180
Played.

300
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,100
[Sighs]
Lend us 5,000.

301
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,220
Want 10?

302
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,700
Lend us 5,000.
Thanks.

303
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,900
Oh, you all right?
Good to see you.

304
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,820
- Angela.
- Hi.

305
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,500
- Hey, gorgeous. You off?
- Oh, hey, babe. Listen, I left my phone at yours.

306
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,700
- Um, pick it up tomorrow?
- Okay. That's fine.

307
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,700
- You were great tonight.
- Thank you.

308
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,740
Look, uh, well, I was just in the area
and I wondered if you were free tonight?

309
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,260
- Um, no. No, I'm not, actually.
- Oh.

310
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,460
Um, I'd much rather go for a drink
with you than this date...

311
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,380
but, um, can't really get out of it.

312
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,140
Well, I-I-I understand.
I thought I would give it a try.

313
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,660
Well, if you are free tomorrow,
I'm doing a photo shoot in Brighton.

314
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,500
- A photo shoot?
- Yeah. I'm just modeling a few things.

315
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,180
You could, um, come if you like.
Spend the afternoon together?

316
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,580
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

317
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,580
All right.

318
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,260
Terry? Terry. Thank God you're here.
Look, I know it's early-

319
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,060
- Ian, I won £30,000 last night.
- What? What?

320
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,300
- £30,000 playing poker.
- 30 grand?

321
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,860
Well, you need to put it in
a bank and never play again.

322
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,060
I can't tell you the feeling.

323
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,540
My head was swimming. It was like I stepped
out of my body. Every bet, every card.

324
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,100
- You lucky bast-You lucky bastard.
- [Chuckles]

325
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,020
- Can I tell you something?
- What?

326
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:28,060
The real thrill? Almost losing. Knowing I was
a card away from being wiped out and hanging in.

327
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,100
Yeah. What about Kate?
She must be over the moon.

328
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,860
Oh, she doesn't know.

329
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,140
- No?
- No. She'd never understand. Not these stakes.

330
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,220
<i>- Plus, I need the cash to play again.
- Terry.</i>

331
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,620
If I lose it back,
then I lose it back, all right?

332
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,820
My goal is to make enough money
to buy this house we saw. Then I'll tell her.

333
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,980
Right. I suppose now is as good a time as any
to ask if I could borrow a few hundred quid.

334
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,900
- Of course. What's mine is yours.
- Thanks.

335
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,420
Thirty grand.
That is a lot of cash, Terry.

336
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,100
<i>- Why is you here this hour?
- I need to borrow the X.K. again.</i>

337
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,580
<i>- Uh, it's not here, Brother.
- What?</i>

338
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,580
<i>- Got a heavy date?
- Yeah. How did you know?</i>

339
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,980
<i>- Well, loan us some money, borrow the flash car.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

340
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,060
<i>What am I gonna do?
I do need that car.</i>

341
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,020
<i>- There is a nice E-type here.
- Is there?</i>

342
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,980
I promised it back today...

343
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,060
- but I guess I can manipulate things for tomorrow.
- Let's have a look.

344
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,180
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah, that will do.

345
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,100
Playin' the big shot
since we were this high.

346
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,180
All right, don't rub my nose in it. You should
see her. She's so beautiful, this woman.

347
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,100
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

348
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,260
Don't smash it up.
We'd have a lot of explaining to do.

349
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,060
- Where the bloody hell were you yesterday?
- I couldn't make it in.

350
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,740
You're supposed to be here. No one knew
what the bloody hell they were doing.

351
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,100
You weren't here.
You weren't answering your mobile.

352
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,900
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

353
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,900
You waltz in here at 10
past 3:00 in the afternoon.

354
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,620
<i>We were inspected yesterday.
Now they're gonna turn us over.</i>

355
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,940
Look, I'm sorry.
Sometimes I have a life of my own.

356
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,900
What? Doing what? Some crackpot
financial scheme, eh? Or is it a woman?

357
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,660
- Yes, Terry told me you had a date.
- Yes, I was with a girl.

358
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,860
I've never been with a girl
like this before, Dad.

359
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:05,580
She was beautiful and classy
and smart. Just leave it. Leave it.

360
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,420
When they arrived, they found
these two literary geniuses...

361
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,660
floating around in the middle of the ocean
in their life jackets sipping martinis.

362
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,380
That's just what I was saying.
Sailing can be dangerous.

363
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,420
- Well, Ian has a boat.
- Oh, really?

364
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,380
Oh, just a little
sailboat, yeah.

365
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,700
I've always wanted to sail
around the Greek islands.

366
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,140
- Oh, God, that'd be fun, wouldn't it?
- Yeah.

367
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,060
Do you actually sleep
on the boat?

368
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,100
You can. It's very small,
but, yes, you can.

369
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,220
<i>- [Man] So what do you do, Ian?
- I'm in business.</i>

370
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,500
- Hotels in California. Come. Shall we dance?
- Yes.

371
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,020
Do you know what? Those two
make such a beautiful couple.

372
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,980
- I think it's their duty to reproduce.
- [Chuckles]

373
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,980
Take me sailing.

374
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,260
I will.

375
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,940
I love it. You're so charmingly
awkward with my friends.

376
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,940
It's so sweet.

377
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,860
Take me to the Greek islands.
Take me all around the world.

378
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,780
I want us to go to California together.

379
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,540
<i>Terry, I need to talk to you
about money again. I'm sorry.</i>

380
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,100
I wondered if I could borrow
the X.K. or the "E"?

381
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,900
What's the matter with you?
You look like death warmed up.

382
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,980
Ian, I lost a lot of money
in a card game last night.

383
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,340
- Well, how much?
- A lot. Come here.

384
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,300
Well, what is a lot?
How much?

385
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,460
- I lost back the 30.
- Yeah.

386
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,660
Plus another £90,000.

387
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,580
Terry, what is wrong with you?

388
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,540
It was like I was in a trance.

389
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:48,060
- I knew what was happening, but I still kept going.
- Well, that makes me sick.

390
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,620
How are you going to
pay back £90,000?

391
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,620
I have to. I borrowed it
with heavy interest.

392
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,380
What, from loan sharks?
Terry, they're gonna break your legs.

393
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,900
I kept borrowing and borrowing. I figured me
luck had to change, but it only got worse.

394
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,500
Well, I would like to be sympathetic,
but you make me so angry. £90,000?

395
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,220
Ah, Ian, what am I gonna do?

396
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,700
I don't know what you're gonna do.

397
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,620
You don't help yourself
with the whiskey and these pills.

398
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,500
I get migraines, Ian.
Don't get on me. I need help.

399
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,500
Well, how am I gonna help you?

400
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:25,140
Terry. Terry, I'm just a two-bit player myself
who plays a big shot in borrowed cars.

401
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,180
- I haven't got any money.
- You got some money put away. You told me.

402
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,660
I have a little saved for this business
proposition, this investment, the hotel thing...

403
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,020
but I haven't even got
enough for that.

404
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,980
- How am I meant to help you?
- Well, I have to borrow some of it.

405
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,900
Just to make a couple of payments.

406
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,860
- To stall them till I figure out what to do.
- What are you gonna do?

407
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,820
- I don't know.
- To do what?

408
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:51,100
Terry, I came down to see you. And now
you're asking for my savings? Jesus Christ!

409
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,100
- I'm in real trouble, Ian.
- Yes, you're in real trouble.

Well, I'm having a fine time...

I wake up 3:00 in the morning
last night, he's not there.

418
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,500
I go into the front room, and he's sitting there
talking to himself. What's that about?

419
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,940
Well, your father's already started
to forget names and confuse things.

420

In Terry's case it won't be dementia.
It will be blended whiskey.

- Oh, they're gorgeous.

He never forgets,
Howard, does he?

425
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,420
What's it to him? A crumb. If I had that
kind of wealth I'd send you some real money.

But you don't have it.

Did he say where he is?

429
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:29,460
Well, he was still in China, but I think
he's going on holiday to Thailand.

430
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,660
- Oh.
- Yeah.

431
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,940
<i>- [Terry] Mum, can I speak to you a minute?
- Yeah.</i>

432
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,180
<i>- I need to borrow some money.
- How much?</i>

433
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,660
Any part of that £1,000 you can lend me.
Well, all of it, if you can.

434
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:49,060
So what happened? Did your great
winning streak come to an abrupt end?

435
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,820
- Mum-
- What was it? Cards or dice?

436
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,820
- Oh, what the bloody hell's the difference?
- Don't lecture me, Mum.

437
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:01,140
<i>- All right, I'll pay it back.
- With what? You owe everybody you know money.</i>

438
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,140
<i>If I give you my birthday present,
I can say good-bye to it.</i>

439
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,900
All right then, forget it!
All right?

440
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,820
I knew I was asking
the wrong person.

441
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,180
Your dad needs it to pay to the bank.
The restaurant's sucking him dry.

442
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,660
So let him dump it then.

443
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,980
He's put his whole life into it.
It's not about the money.

444
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,260
Well, isn't Ian helping
to get it back on its legs?

445
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,140
Ian can only do so much,
and his heart's not in it.

446
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:28,100
But at least he's got some conscience.
You never had any conscience.

447
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,940
- And Brian's not what he was.
- Can't Uncle Howard help?

448
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,700
He's too proud to ask Howard again,
and he won't let me.

449
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,620
Well, those two
never really got along.

450
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,740
Yes, 'cause you rub his nose
in Howard's success.

451
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,740
Don't you lecture me!

452
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,260
Drink and gambling,
that's your answer to life's problems.

453
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,740
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>

454
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,460
- Someone at the restaurant is stealing from me.
- What?

455
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,100
Oh, I suspect Lewis, the bookkeeper.
He's the only logical one.

456
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,620
But I've known him for years,
and I can't bring myself to accuse him.

457
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,100
Oh, Dad. It's, uh-

458
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,700
- It's not Lewis. It's me.
- You?

459
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,700
Yeah. But I wasn't stealing it.
I had every intention of returning it.

460
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,460
I hope you know I would
never steal from you.

461
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,780
It's just that Terry
got himself in some debt...

462
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,860
and I've been- I've been
trying to help him out.

463
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,220
And I had to use some money
I'd set aside for some business ventures.

464
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,980
What business ventures?
Do you want to leave the restaurant?

465
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,460
Yeah, of course, one day, Dad.
I can't stay there forever. It will kill me.

466
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,220
But not- not next week or anything.

467
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,140
Look, I've met this incredible girl.

468
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,060
You stole money.

469
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,780
No. I'm trying to explain to you.
You just don't want to hear.

470
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,580
I had hoped I would be able to get it back
there before you even noticed.

471
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,500
I wasn't trying to get away
with anything.

472
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,700
And I only took it because
Terry and I got in a bind.

473
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:51,020
- What kind of business venture?
- Investment in hotels.

474
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,340
What the hell do you know
about hotels?

475
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,740
<i>[Mother]
Uncle Howard's coming!</i>

476
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,420
Uncle Howard's coming.
He'll be here tomorrow.

477
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,820
He'll only be in town for a little while,
and then he's leaving for the United States.

478
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,620
But he wants to take us all out to lunch
to celebrate my birthday.

479
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,580
<i>Well, I'm sure he'll put on a big show and then
you won't see him again for another two years.</i>

480
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,500
He's a busy man.

481
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,780
He hasn't time to sit in front of the television,
watching football and swilling beer.

482
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,540
<i>- Get out of my way, Brian, please. Thank you.
- [Water Running]</i>

483
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,620
My plan is to get everything
lined up in advance...

484
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,940
and with a bit of luck, we can close
this deal sooner than we expected.

485
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:32,340
I'm gonna ask my Uncle Howard if he can
introduce you to some movers and shakers.

486
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,260
Oh, I don't want to infringe.

487
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,100
No, no, no, no. He works with a lot of
movie industry people. He's very social.

488
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,180
He plays- He plays golf with some
top directors and some studio heads even.

489
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,940
Oh. God, that would be
a really big break for me.

490
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,780
Well, it's a good time
to ask for this favor.

491
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,540
Well, you're so beautiful
and talented.

492
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,420
All you need is a chance to meet
some of the right people.

493
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,860
<i>- [Elevator Dings]
- [Chattering]</i>

494
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,380
<i>[Terry]
There he is. Howard.</i>

495
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,340
<i>- [Mother] Howard! Oh, my God!
- Hi.</i>

496
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,660
- Hello, love. You all right?
- All right, darling, yes.

497
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,180
- Happy birthday, sweetheart. There you are.
- Oh, my God.

498
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,220
- Uncle Howard, this is Kate.
- Oh, hello, Kate.

499
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,180
Lovely to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

500
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,700
- Yeah, well, it's probably, uh, exaggeration.
- You look great.

501
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,940
Oh, doesn't he look wond-
So-So where are we eating?

502
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,020
- We're going, uh- I booked a table at Claridge's.
- Claridge's?

503
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,980
Oh, we're-we're
not dressed, really.

504
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,020
You can have rich food
for once in your life.

505
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,180
I'm sure your ulcer will survi- Did you
see the doctor that I arranged for you?

506
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,580
- I did, yes.
- He says it's nothing serious, so-

507
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,500
- Well, the pain's damn serious, but-
- Come on, Brian.

508
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,780
- What time we booked in?
- Uh, 1:00, so we, uh-we better go, all right?

509
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,020
Come on. Don't get
left behind. Come on.

510
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,300
You'd-You'd be amazed what's
happening in-in-in China today.

511
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,020
It's a really vital
and exciting place.

512
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,740
<i>Now there's a trade surplus opening up...</i>

513
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,660
<i>and our clinic's really gonna do well.</i>

514
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,980
You wouldn't think that the Chinese would be
so into cosmetic surgery, would you?

515
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,940
They're-They're capitalists, Kate.

516
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,260
<i>They're-They're-They're way
more capitalistic than we are.</i>

517
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:02,820
[Kate] Right.

518
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,980
Do you know, I was hoping you'd bring
your new wife. I'd love to meet her.

519
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,500
Ah, yes, I know. Well, Connie's busy.

520
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,500
She-She does a lot of work
promoting our clinic back in L.A., so-

521
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,820
But she really wanted to come.

522
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,420
And, Howard, you never
think of having a family?

523
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,820
- You're my family.
- Oh, Howard.

524
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,420
- Oh, Howard.
- Thanks, Howard.

525
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,940
That's sweet.

526
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,460
Everything's okay?
You need anything?

527
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:32,140
Well, we're all right, thank God. But, look,
Howard, I know the boys wanted to talk to you.

528
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,900
Boys, I was just telling Howard that
you'd want to talk to him privately.

529
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,020
Uh, yeah,
if-if-if you have some time.

530
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,820
When it's convenient
for you.

531
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,300
Yeah, well, uh, we'll just drop
Brian and Dorothy at home...

532
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,940
and then we'll-we'll-we'll have a drink,
just the three of us.

533
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,860
<i>- There you go, boys.
- [Terry] All right, great.</i>

534
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,220
That's lovely, Howard.
Thank you, darling. You made my day.

535
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,980
[Sniffles]
I couldn't help myself, Uncle Howard.

536
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,780
I mean, I know we talked about it
and I gave you my word...

537
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,980
but sometimes, I-I just get
out of control, you know?

538
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,420
I'll get help.
I promise it won't happen again.

539
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,860
For Christ's sake, Terry, stop cryin'.
Uncle Howard's not berating you.

540
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,700
He's- He just-
He's drank a little too much.

541
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,020
Well, I-I-I don't
set myself up as a judge.

542
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,140
I-I-I counsel common sense.
I understand human needs.

543
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,140
All right. But I know I got myself into this bind
and I'm aware of how serious it is.

544
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,940
Yeah, yes, I hear you. Now, y-you just-
you just pull yourself together.

545
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,460
I'm not going to-
I'm not going to lecture you.

546
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,220
I think losing such a steep
amount is a lesson in itself...

547
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,300
<i>much, much more than
anything I could say.</i>

548
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,700
<i>God. I feel like
suddenly I'm in a dream.</i>

549
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,900
Well, everybody makes mistakes.
We'll deal with it.

550
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,540
The key is you-you-you recognize
the need for help, okay?

551
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,740
Yeah.

552
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,940
So, Ian, what's on your mind?

553
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,980
Um...

554
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:55,740
well, you always said if I found something I
wanted to devote myself to to come to you.

555
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,380
- Ian's met this girl.
- Let me tell it, Terry.

556
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,620
I have a chance of coming in
on a surefire business deal.

557
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,260
Yeah, well, there's no such thing
as a surefire deal, but go on.

558
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,580
There's some partners want to invest in two
hotels, in your neck of the woods, actually...

559
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,500
in-in Los Angeles...

560
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,900
<i>- and naturally, this requires an outlay of funds.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

561
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,420
Which, of course, you would
get back with interest.

562
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,900
If the hotels show a profit.

563
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,140
They will, Uncle Howard.
They will.

564
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,700
So what kind of money
are we looking at?

565
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:30,940
£70,000 or £80,000.
Possibly even £100,000.

566
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:36,220
Well, can I let my accountants have a look at
what details you have? It could be of some help.

567
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,660
We'll, I'll be- I'll be grateful
for any guidance, of course...

568
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,540
but, uh, I really
need the money soon.

569
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,940
And-And who is
this young woman?

570
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,460
<i>Ah. Well, our plan is to move
to California. She's an actress.</i>

571
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:53,940
I-I was gonna ask you if there were some people
you-you might be able to introduce her to.

572
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,300
Oh, yeah, for sure.
Contacts never hurt an aspiring talent.

573
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,740
Oh, she would be
so grateful, as would I.

574
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,580
I'm obviously
just crazy about her.

575
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,660
I'm very close with a lot of people
in the film industry and some, uh-

576
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,300
<i>- I just feel it's- it's now or never for me.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

577
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:13,940
Yeah, I understand that feeling. You-You see
a real opportunity, you really want to grab it.

578
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,180
Otherwise, you spend the rest of your life
wondering what might have been.

579
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,180
We'll both find a way
to pay you back.

580
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,820
<i>- Yeah, well, I, um-
- [Thunderclap]</i>

581
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,820
I wanted to talk to you about that.

582
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,100
<i>- Uh, let's, um- let's- let's go under those trees.
- [Thunder]</i>

583
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:43,700
Well, um, I think you'll agree that
family loyalty cuts both ways.

584
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,620
Oh, without a doubt.

585
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,940
And thank God I've never had
to ask you for anything...

586
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,780
but, uh, the time has come when,
uh, I need your help.

587
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,260
- Name it, Uncle Howard.
- Anything.

588
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,260
Well, I seem to have got
myself into a little situation.

589
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,420
Yes?

590
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,180
Well, uh, actually, it's, uh- it's-
it's more serious than that.

591
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,900
And, uh, after much thought,
there don't seem to be many options.

592
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,300
Right.

593
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,300
Well, there's going to be
a review in a few months...

594
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,460
an investigation into my, uh, business affairs,
you know, the foundation and the clinics-

595
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,860
and, uh, there's
a former member of staff...

596
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,340
who is prepared to talk about things that
could be extremely detrimental to me.

597
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,300
I, uh- extremely.

598
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,260
But surely you have
nothing to worry about.

599
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,860
Well, to be
quite candid, l-

600
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,540
I really can't allow
a colleague called Martin Burns...

601
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,980
to give certain evidence.

602
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,420
But why?
Sorry, I-I'm not following.

603
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,340
Well, I-I'm in a very vulnerable position
and the consequences could be dire.

604
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,860
Well, what are the options? Is this Martin
Burns unwilling to listen to reason?

605
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:45,780
Well, unfortunately, I've had several discussions
with him, and he just won't see it my way.

606
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,020
Well, why not?
Is it not just a question of money?

607
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,820
Well, not really. I don't think
compensation would change his mind...

608
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,740
and, to be quite honest,
it's not a road I really want to go down.

609
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,700
Well, what then?

610
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,100
Uh, I think Burns
has to be got rid of.

611
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,020
Rid of?

612
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:07,100
If there was any other solution,
and believe me, I have racked my brains-

613
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,020
But unless he's out of the picture...

614
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,980
I am looking at a very long period of time
in jail, what could be the rest of my life.

615
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,100
My God.
What have you done?

616
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,300
- Don't talk to me like that!
- I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean any disrespect.

617
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,260
I have made some very, very difficult
decisions to avoid being ruined.

618
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,180
I was aware when I made them that I was
having- that I was taking some kind of risk.

619
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,420
But the stakes were enormous. I shouldn't
have to talk to you about betting on risks.

620
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,460
I didn't mean anything.

621
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,980
You don't build what I've built
by always playing by the book.

622
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,900
- Now you'll find that out.
- Uncle Howard, he didn't mean to be rude.

623
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,860
You didn't question my ethics when you were,
uh-when you wanted something from me.

624
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,780
Look, Uncle Howard, we're
not questioning your ethics.

625
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,020
<i>- I'm sure you know what you're doing.
- We're just surprised.</i>

626
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:48,500
Oh, what? Surprised? Surprised by what?
Surprised that I need some help?

627
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,020
Surprised that, uh-
that-that my life could fall apart...

628
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,740
if this one weak sister,
this ungrateful failure...

629
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,500
elects to sell me out
to save his own skin?

630
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,900
By getting rid of him,
do- do you mean-

631
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:07,340
He cannot be allowed to testify
by whatever means are necessary.

632
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,420
He wants us to kill him.

633
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,100
<i>But at this point,
I can see no other way.</i>

634
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,700
I can't beg it. I can't buy it.

635
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,100
<i>But this has to happen
in order for me to survive.</i>

636
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,980
<i>- God. God.
- [Howard] Christ, be a man.</i>

637
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,940
I don't want to kill anybody.

638
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,900
<i>I need to know if you two can come through
for me. You're the only people I can turn to.</i>

639
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:32,060
But there must be people who do
this sort of thing f-for a fee, I mean.

640
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,460
Well, I-I-I wouldn't know
how to find such a person.

641
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,100
And if I did, they'd
always have it over me...

642
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,540
or-or they'd turn out to be some
undercover policeman or something.

643
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,620
I mean,
I am in unfamiliar waters.

644
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,260
I need the help of people
who I can trust with my life.

645
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,060
<i>- I cannot kill somebody.
- Oh, right.</i>

646
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,020
So that's it, isn't it? It's fine
to count on me, your mother...

647
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,500
your father when he couldn't
put food on the table.

648
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,780
It's fine for you to come-
come to me for everything.

649
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,620
It's what you're askin', Uncle Howard.
You can see the imbalance.

650
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,060
Burns could have an accident.

651
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,020
Burns could be hit by car or-
or killed in a street mugging.

652
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,540
- Jesus Christ, Uncle Howard!
- Stop! Stop simpering!

653
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,500
What the hell is wrong with you?

654
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,700
You people come to me begging for favors.

655
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,260
"Help me, Uncle Howard.
I need money. I'm in over my head.

656
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,060
I made a mistake.
Help me change my life."

657
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:27,660
How can I help you? How can I attend to
your needs if I'm rotting away somewhere?

658
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,980
Christ, I can't believe you're
putting me through this stuff.

659
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,300
After what I've done for you,
it should be automatic.

660
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,580
Family is family.
Blood is blood.

661
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,300
You don't ask questions.
You protect your own.

662
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,100
<i>- I can't do it!
- It's- It's not that.</i>

663
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,220
I mean, this is so much more
than just a simple favor.

664
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:49,220
Don't lecture me. I wasn't born yesterday.
I realize- I know the gravity of what this-

665
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,220
- Oh, please, just-just forget it.
- I can't do it!

666
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,700
You can do it! You make it look like
an accident. It's just that you won't do it.

667
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:59,060
I've got nobody else
that I can count on.

668
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,100
<i>Don't- Don't bother. Forget I asked.</i>

669
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,140
Forget- Forget we know each other. Let's
have nothing more to do with each other...

670
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:10,420
because, obviously, your idea of family is,
uh- is very different from mine.

671
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,340
<i>I've never seen him like that.
He was so angry. He was a different person.</i>

672
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,660
- He's a crook, Ian.
- Terry, we don't know all the details.

673
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,780
Christ, what's he expect?
We're gonna kill some guy for him?

674
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,420
He was desperate. If you look
at it from his point of view...

675
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,980
a favor that's easy to do,
you can ask anyone for, but-

676
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,860
if you have to ask someone a favor that's a real
favor, then you know who your friends are.

677
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,300
- To think we'd be capable of such a thing.
- I agree.

678
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,700
I mean, family is one thing,
but there are limits.

679
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,100
You'd never consider anything
like that, would you?

680
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,020
No. Would you?

681
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,620
- Not me. You think he hates us?
- I think he's disappointed.

682
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,540
Yeah, well, I am too.

683
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,140
Well, it's been a day of shattered hopes
for you, me and Howard.

684
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,140
Oh, Christ. You think he'll wind up
in prison for the rest of his life?

685
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,380
I don't know. It doesn't bear
thinkin' about. Terry...

686
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,460
- my hands are shakin'.
- I don't feel good, Ian.

687
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,500
Christ, I think
I'm gonna be sick.

688
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,940
[Moans]

689
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,980
Terry? Terry, wake up.
Terry, wake-wake-wake-wake-wake up.

690
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,940
It's all right. You're havin' a bad dream.
You're havin' a bad dream.

691
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,300
It's all right. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

692
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,420
My heart is pounding.

693
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,380
Yeah, you're really sweating.
What on earth were you dreaming?

694
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,540
Oh, Kate, we have to move.

695
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:32,980
- What are you talkin' about? We can't move.
- Oh, yeah, we have to move.

696
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,460
No, we live here.
Our lives are here. We're not moving.

697
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,780
What on earth were you dreaming?
For God's sake.

698
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,220
- [Rings]
- God! Who's that? It's 4:00 in the morning.

699
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,180
- Christ.
- [Rings]

700
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,100
- Who is it?
- Hello?

701
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,140
- It's me.
- What's wrong? Are you all right?

702
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,940
- Who is it?
- We need to talk.

703
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,780
What is it?

704
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,860
I don't want to
speak on the phone.

705
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,140
I just want to say that
I-I haven't slept all night.

706
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,460
I've been up and down
a dozen times thinkin' and...

707
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:07,220
the conclusion I've come to is that we're
gonna have to accommodate Uncle Howard.

708
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,020
He'll be in London for the next few weeks.
He, uh- He has a flat in Knightsbridge.

709
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,980
We need to get
a good look at him.

710
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,140
<i>I'm having breakfast
with him at the Connaught.</i>

711
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:20,980
I've-I've worked hard at- at, uh,
keeping good relations with him...

712
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,100
but, um, we both know
what the score is, that's for sure.

713
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,060
Anyway, I'll tell you when we're there
and then you can be there as well.

714
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,180
And you can stop
by the table and, uh-

715
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:35,540
and, uh, I'll introduce you, and then
you can get a good look at him.

716
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:40,140
It sounds good to me. We need to know
who it is that we're gonna- that we're gonna-

717
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,620
- You can't even say it.
- Terry.

718
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,340
<i>- You can't even say what it is we're talking about.
- No, wait.</i>

719
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,140
Wait, wait, wait. I-I thought, um-
I thought we were past this bit.

720
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,420
<i>We are. We are.
We'll check him out at the Connaught.</i>

721
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,980
[Clears Throat]

722
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,900
All right, well, I'll give you,
um, all the information you need-

723
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,460
where he lives in London, his flat, you know,
when he visits his- his mother, phone numbers...

724
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,980
and then-
then it's in your hands.

725
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,220
Don't let me down.

726
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,660
<i>Now, I shall be
in the Far East for a few days...</i>

727
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,860
<i>and I want it taken care of
while I'm away.</i>

728
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,860
<i>I don't want to know about it.</i>

729
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:25,420
<i>I just want it over and done with
when I get back.</i>

730
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,140
<i>Quick, simple, no witnesses.</i>

731
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:34,540
And then just let it
fade into history.

732
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,980
You can count on us,
Uncle Howard. You can. Yeah.

733
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:45,620
I understand the- the magnitude
of the favor that I'm asking.

734
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,660
But I promise you, boys,
you won't be sorry.

735
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,540
Oh, I can't do it, Ian. I can't!

736
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,460
No, we're gonna do it, Terry. Because Uncle
Howard needs us to do this very badly.

737
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,100
Oh, let's not play games, Ian. You're
thinkin' of us, what we can get out of it.

738
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,140
I'm not playing games, Terry.

739
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,780
Your whole life is in the toilet unless you've
got some way of payin' off a £90,000 debt.

740
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,420
- I'm not as cool as you are, Ian.
- I am not cool, Terry.

741
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:14,420
I-I-I'm finding it very hard not to panic.
But this is a way out for me too.

742
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,180
Now you don't like playing on
the small-stake tables. Well, neither do I.

743
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,580
This is a big shot for me, Terry.
To make a big step up in life.

744
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,180
- Ian, it's murder. All right?
- I know what it is.

745
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:28,740
- Yeah, well, don't forget it!
- You don't have to explain it to me, Terry.

746
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:33,580
This guy is just a total stranger to us who's
doing a very bad thing to Uncle Howard.

747
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,940
<i>Christ. Why can't he listen to reason?</i>

748
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,020
Why's he have to go opening
his mouth to investigators?

749
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,700
Look, I've been thinking about this, Terry.
You push a button and it's over.

750
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,620
Except it's not a button, Ian.

751
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,620
<i>For Christ's sake! Why do you have
to keep making matters worse?</i>

752
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,780
<i>It's a job. If we were in the army...</i>

753
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,100
we'd be expected to
kill strangers every day...

754
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,100
to profit men who're
up to here in corruption.

755
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:57,340
Well, I can't look him
face-to-face and then kill him.

756
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,740
This is wrong, Ian!
It's just wrong!

757
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,660
<i>Christ. Will you stop lookin' at everything
through a bloody microscope?</i>

758
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,940
<i>As soon as you look at anything too closely,
you reveal all the ugly imperfections.</i>

759
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,820
Look, for the first time in my life,
I've met a woman and I'm in love with her.

760
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,180
Now if you don't want to
do this, I'll do it myself.

761
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,100
We'll get caught! Every murderer
thinks he can get away with it...

762
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,420
and then something little
goes wrong and it's over.

763
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,100
No, you're wrong. You're wrong.
Most killings go unsolved.

764
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,780
The real world is not what
you watch on the television.

765
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,700
Well, if we do it,
there's no turnin' back.

766
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,940
Look. I think I know how you feel
when you're at the card table.

767
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,980
I feel like I'm in a dream.

768
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:36,020
I think we have got the winning hand, and I
want to plunge forward. I want to push my luck.

769
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,420
I can't look him in the eye
and then kill him. Right?

770
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:38,860
Okay, okay.

771
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,740
We'll just observe him from
a distance at breakfast, all right?

772
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,060
We'll get a good look and then
there'll be no mistakin' him.

773
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,460
Stop staring, Ian.

774
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,460
I want to get a good look at him.

775
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:57,140
<i>[Terry] That poor bastard.
Eatin' his breakfast.</i>

776
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,580
<i>He has no idea
his days are numbered.</i>

777
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,580
Oh, life can be so wicked, Ian.

778
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,700
Have you got a good look at him, Terry?
Will you remember his face? I will.

779
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,820
I just got a small part in this French film
that I auditioned for.

780
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,100
The director thinks
I'd look classy in bed.

781
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:21,820
- Do you speak French?
- Mmm. I'm fluent, actually.

782
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:26,340
<i>My uncle is learning Chinese
at his age. It's brilliant.</i>

783
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,380
You guys close?

784
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,340
He lives in California.
He's got a big house, beautiful pool, car.

785
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:35,500
He's a great guy. Would you sleep
with a director to get a part?
