1
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:03,796
What the fuck is that?

2
00:01:04,158 --> 00:01:05,273
Jimmy?

3
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:07,514
- What's up?
- Did I hit something?

4
00:01:07,678 --> 00:01:09,270
What the fuck is that?

5
00:01:10,598 --> 00:01:12,111
Maybe you got a flat?

6
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:14,587
No.

7
00:01:16,038 --> 00:01:18,871
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.

8
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:46,354
He's still alive. You piece of shit!

9
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:47,996
Die, you motherfucker!

10
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:49,431
Look at me!

11
00:01:58,158 --> 00:02:01,992
<i>As far back as I can remember,</i>
<i>I always wanted to be a gangster.</i>

12
00:02:40,198 --> 00:02:41,347
<i>To me...</i>

13
00:02:41,798 --> 00:02:45,791
<i>... being a gangster was better than</i>
<i>being president of the United States.</i>

14
00:02:48,998 --> 00:02:52,115
<i>Even before I went to the cabstand</i>
<i>for an after-school job...</i>

15
00:02:52,198 --> 00:02:54,473
<i>... I knew I wanted to be part of them.</i>

16
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:58,710
<i>It was there that I knew I belonged.</i>
<i>To me, it meant being somebody...</i>

17
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:01,193
<i>... in a neighborhood full of nobodies.</i>

18
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:04,708
<i>They weren't like anybody else.</i>
<i>They did whatever they wanted.</i>

19
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,154
<i>They parked in front of hydrants</i>
<i>and never got a ticket.</i>

20
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:10,354
<i>When they played cards all night...</i>

21
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:12,474
<i>... nobody ever called the cops.</i>

22
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:25,876
Tony Stacks. How are you?

23
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:28,671
<i>Tuddy Cicero.</i>

24
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,188
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

25
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:35,113
<i>Tuddy.</i>

26
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:39,429
<i>Tuddy ran the cabstand</i>
<i>and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...</i>

27
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:44,234
<i>... and other places for his brother, Paul,</i>
<i>who was the boss of the neighborhood.</i>

28
00:03:48,198 --> 00:03:50,473
<i>Paulie might have moved slow...</i>

29
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,792
<i>... but it was only because Paulie</i>
<i>didn't have to move for anybody.</i>

30
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:03,029
- It's your fault.
- You started it!

31
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,870
I started it? It's your fault.

32
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:09,315
<i>At first my parents loved that I found</i>
<i>a job across the street from the house.</i>

33
00:04:10,278 --> 00:04:13,907
<i>My father, who was Irish,</i>
<i>was sent to work at the age of 11.</i>

34
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:16,188
<i>He liked that I got myself a job.</i>

35
00:04:16,318 --> 00:04:19,754
<i>He always used to say</i>
<i>that American kids were spoiled lazy.</i>

36
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:27,909
Henry! Watch how you cross!

37
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:29,591
Bring back milk!

38
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:32,716
<i>My mother was happy after</i>
<i>she found out the Ciceros...</i>

39
00:04:32,798 --> 00:04:36,347
<i>... came from the same part of Sicily</i>
<i>as she did. To my mother...</i>

40
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:39,106
<i>... that was the answer to all her prayers.</i>

41
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:42,514
<i>I was the luckiest kid in the world.</i>

42
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:44,828
<i>I could go anywhere, do anything.</i>

43
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:48,351
<i>I knew everybody, and everybody knew me.</i>

44
00:04:48,798 --> 00:04:52,916
<i>Wiseguys would pull up and Tuddy</i>
<i>would let me park their Cadillacs.</i>

45
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:56,873
<i>Here I am, this little kid,</i>
<i>I can't even see over the steering wheel...</i>

46
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,914
<i>... and I'm parking Cadillacs.</i>

47
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:04,189
<i>But, it wasn't too long...</i>

48
00:05:04,358 --> 00:05:08,510
<i>... before my parents changed</i>
<i>their minds about my job at the cabstand.</i>

49
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:13,268
<i>For them, it was supposed to be</i>
<i>a part-time job. But for me...</i>

50
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:15,270
<i>... it was definitely full time.</i>

51
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:17,155
<i>That's all I wanted to do.</i>

52
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:21,397
<i>People like my father could never</i>
<i>understand, but I was part of something.</i>

53
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:24,197
<i>I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up.</i>

54
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:25,752
Tell him 519.

55
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:28,668
<i>Every day I was learning to score.</i>

56
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,553
<i>A dollar here, a dollar there.</i>
<i>I was living in a fantasy.</i>

57
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:36,949
Did you have a good day at school?

58
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:39,188
<i>My father was always pissed off.</i>

59
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:42,714
<i>Pissed that he made such lousy money,</i>
<i>that my brother Michael...</i>

60
00:05:42,798 --> 00:05:44,277
<i>... was in a wheelchair.</i>

61
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:48,192
<i>He was pissed that there were seven of us</i>
<i>living in such a tiny house.</i>

62
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:50,071
Tell me about this.

63
00:05:50,598 --> 00:05:52,316
It's a letter from school.

64
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:55,592
It says you haven't been there in months.

65
00:05:57,118 --> 00:05:58,392
In months!

66
00:05:59,878 --> 00:06:01,311
You're a bum!

67
00:06:01,758 --> 00:06:03,714
Want to grow up to be a bum?

68
00:06:05,118 --> 00:06:09,111
<i>After a while, he was mostly pissed</i>
<i>because I hung around the cabstand.</i>

69
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:11,195
<i>He knew what went on there.</i>

70
00:06:11,398 --> 00:06:15,914
<i>Every once in a while I'd have to take</i>
<i>a beating. But by then, I didn't care.</i>

71
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:17,750
<i>The way I saw it...</i>

72
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:20,632
<i>... everybody takes a beating sometime.</i>

73
00:06:21,678 --> 00:06:23,316
I can't make any more deliveries.

74
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:25,514
What? You'll fuck everything up.

75
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:27,668
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.

76
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:29,032
Come with me.

77
00:06:29,158 --> 00:06:30,796
- Is that him there?
- No.

78
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,191
- How about him?
- No.

79
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:37,035
- That's the guy...
- Get him.

80
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:40,152
Excuse me.

81
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:43,752
- Scumbag.
- Come here, you piece of shit.

82
00:06:51,558 --> 00:06:53,071
- Know this kid?
- Yeah.

83
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:55,196
- Know where he lives?
- Yeah.

84
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:57,234
- You deliver mail to his house?
- Yeah.

85
00:06:57,318 --> 00:07:01,152
From now on, any letter from school
to his house comes directly here.

86
00:07:01,318 --> 00:07:02,546
Understand?

87
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:05,710
Another letter from school
goes to that kid's house...

88
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:07,909
...in the oven you'll go, head first.

89
00:07:07,998 --> 00:07:12,150
<i>That was it. No more letters from</i>
<i>truant officers. No letters from school.</i>

90
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:14,314
<i>In fact, no more letters from anybody.</i>

91
00:07:14,398 --> 00:07:17,037
<i>After a few weeks, my mother went</i>
<i>to the post office to complain.</i>

92
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:20,229
<i>How could I go to school after that...</i>

93
00:07:20,318 --> 00:07:23,913
<i>... and pledge allegiance and sit through</i>
<i>good government bullshit?</i>

94
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:30,428
<i>Paulie hated phones.</i>
<i>He wouldn't have one in his house.</i>

95
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:32,907
Mickey called. Want me to call him back?

96
00:07:32,998 --> 00:07:34,636
All right, make the call.

97
00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:39,189
<i>He got all his calls second hand.</i>
<i>Then you'd have to call the people back.</i>

98
00:07:39,438 --> 00:07:41,827
Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.

99
00:07:42,558 --> 00:07:47,188
<i>There were guys, that's all they did all</i>
<i>day, was take care of Paulie's calls.</i>

100
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:58,633
<i>For a guy who moved all day long...</i>

101
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,711
<i>... Paulie didn't talk to six people.</i>
<i>With union problems...</i>

102
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:03,675
<i>... or a beef in the numbers...</i>

103
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,035
<i>... only the top guys spoke</i>
<i>with Paulie about the problem.</i>

104
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,588
<i>Everything was one-on-one.</i>
<i>Paulie hated conferences.</i>

105
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:13,512
<i>He didn't want anybody</i>
<i>hearing what he said...</i>

106
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:16,510
<i>... or anyone listening to</i>
<i>what he was being told.</i>

107
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:20,950
<i>Hundreds of guys depended on him, and</i>
<i>he got a piece of everything they made.</i>

108
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:25,430
<i>It was a tribute, like in the old country,</i>
<i>except they were doing it in America.</i>

109
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,756
<i>All they got from Paulie was protection</i>
<i>from the guys trying to rip them off.</i>

110
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:33,917
<i>That's what it's all about. That's</i>
<i>what the FBI could never understand.</i>

111
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:36,547
<i>What Paulie and the Organization does...</i>

112
00:08:36,678 --> 00:08:40,307
<i>... is protect people who can't</i>
<i>go to the cops. That's it.</i>

113
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:44,795
<i>They're like the police department</i>
<i>for wiseguys.</i>

114
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:58,151
<i>People looked at me differently,</i>
<i>and they knew I was with somebody.</i>

115
00:08:58,398 --> 00:09:02,596
<i>I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery</i>
<i>on Sunday morning for fresh bread.</i>

116
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:06,950
<i>The owner knew who I was with, and no</i>
<i>matter how many people were waiting...</i>

117
00:09:07,038 --> 00:09:08,915
<i>... I was taken care of first.</i>

118
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:13,431
<i>Our neighbors stopped parking in</i>
<i>our driveway, even though we had no car.</i>

119
00:09:13,598 --> 00:09:14,553
<i>At 13...</i>

120
00:09:14,718 --> 00:09:19,030
<i>... I was making more money than most</i>
<i>of the grown-ups in the neighborhood.</i>

121
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:20,711
<i>I had it all.</i>

122
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:30,072
<i>One day...</i>

123
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:34,709
<i>One day, some neighborhood kids carried</i>
<i>my mother's groceries all the way home.</i>

124
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,232
<i>You know why?</i>

125
00:09:37,038 --> 00:09:38,869
<i>It was out of respect.</i>

126
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:41,911
What do you think?

127
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:45,829
Aren't my shoes great?

128
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:48,790
You look like a gangster.

129
00:09:48,878 --> 00:09:50,630
They shot me. Help!

130
00:09:52,878 --> 00:09:54,675
Henry, shut the door.

131
00:09:55,598 --> 00:09:58,635
<i>That was the first time</i>
<i>I had ever seen anyone shot.</i>

132
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:01,908
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!

133
00:10:01,998 --> 00:10:03,670
I can't have that in this joint.

134
00:10:03,758 --> 00:10:06,477
<i>I remember feeling bad about the guy,</i>
<i>but also...</i>

135
00:10:06,718 --> 00:10:08,788
<i>... feeling maybe Tuddy was right.</i>

136
00:10:08,878 --> 00:10:11,438
<i>I knew Paulie didn't want</i>
<i>anyone dying in the building.</i>

137
00:10:11,518 --> 00:10:15,113
You're a real jerk. You wasted
eight fucking aprons on this guy.

138
00:10:15,438 --> 00:10:18,475
What's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.

139
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:39,269
<i>It was a glorious time.</i>

140
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:42,672
<i>And wiseguys were all over the place.</i>

141
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,237
<i>It was before Apalachin</i>
<i>and before Crazy Joe...</i>

142
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:49,197
<i>... decided to take on</i>
<i>a boss and start a war.</i>

143
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:51,909
<i>It was when I met the world.</i>

144
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:54,797
<i>And it was when</i>
<i>I first met Jimmy Conway.</i>

145
00:10:55,998 --> 00:11:00,628
<i>He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29</i>
<i>at the time, but he was already a legend.</i>

146
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,112
<i>He'd walk in the door and everybody</i>
<i>who worked the room just went wild.</i>

147
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:07,917
<i>He'd give a doorman $100</i>
<i>just for opening the door.</i>

148
00:11:07,998 --> 00:11:11,593
<i>He'd give hundreds to the dealers</i>
<i>and the guys who ran the games.</i>

149
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,716
<i>The bartender got $100 just</i>
<i>for keeping the ice cubes cold.</i>

150
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:17,517
The Irishman is here
to take you Guineas' money.

151
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:22,946
- Want a drink?
- Give me a Seven and Seven.

152
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:32,274
I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.

153
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,837
How you doin'?

154
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:37,107
Thank you.

155
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:38,467
Keep them coming.

156
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:41,436
<i>Jimmy was one of the most</i>
<i>feared guys in the city.</i>

157
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:45,751
<i>He was first locked up at 11,</i>
<i>and doing hits for mob bosses at 16.</i>

158
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:49,231
<i>Hits never bothered Jimmy.</i>
<i>It was business.</i>

159
00:11:49,598 --> 00:11:53,591
<i>But what Jimmy really loved to do...</i>
<i>what he really loved to do was steal.</i>

160
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,749
<i>He actually enjoyed it.</i>

161
00:11:56,238 --> 00:12:00,072
<i>Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted</i>
<i>for the bad guys in movies.</i>

162
00:12:00,718 --> 00:12:02,197
Give me your wallet.

163
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:08,235
You might know who we are,
but we know who you are.

164
00:12:08,318 --> 00:12:10,388
<i>He was one of the city's biggest hijackers...</i>

165
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:14,153
<i>... of booze, cigarettes, razor blades,</i>
<i>shrimp and lobsters.</i>

166
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:15,911
<i>Shrimp and lobsters were best.</i>

167
00:12:15,998 --> 00:12:17,272
<i>They went fast.</i>

168
00:12:17,518 --> 00:12:21,113
<i>Almost all of them were gimmies.</i>
<i>They just gave it up, no problem.</i>

169
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:22,870
<i>They called him Jimmy the Gent.</i>

170
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,073
Help the lady.

171
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:26,433
<i>Drivers loved him.</i>
<i>They used to tip him off...</i>

172
00:12:26,518 --> 00:12:29,908
<i>... about the really good loads.</i>
<i>Of course, everybody got a piece.</i>

173
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:32,387
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.

174
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:37,271
Henry, come here.

175
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,591
Say hello to Tommy.

176
00:12:40,238 --> 00:12:43,548
You're gonna be working together, okay?
Help him. Go ahead.

177
00:12:44,558 --> 00:12:46,549
Jimmy, you got anything good?

178
00:12:46,878 --> 00:12:50,791
<i>And when the cops assigned a whole</i>
<i>army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?</i>

179
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:53,670
<i>He made them partners.</i>

180
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:55,590
I'd complain, but who'd listen?

181
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:59,348
- What do you need?
- Two Luckys.

182
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:01,713
- Here you go, Henry.
- Thanks a lot.

183
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,428
- What do you need?
- One Pall Mall.

184
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,471
What are you doing?

185
00:13:06,558 --> 00:13:08,469
- It's all right.
- Says who? Your mother?

186
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:09,991
How many Pall Malls you need?

187
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,070
- Where'd you get the cigarettes?
- Get him out of here.

188
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:14,950
- It's okay.
- It's not okay!

189
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:18,588
- You don't understand.
- You don't understand. Store's closed.

190
00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:24,470
- Henry got pinched.
- Where?

191
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:26,311
By the factory.

192
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:30,472
Henry Hill. The People of
the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.

193
00:13:30,718 --> 00:13:32,231
Docket #704162.

194
00:13:34,798 --> 00:13:36,390
Yes, sir. That's me.

195
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,712
Just stand there. Now stay there.

196
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,591
Counselor, proceed.

197
00:13:53,038 --> 00:13:54,471
Congratulations.

198
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:56,310
Here's your graduation present.

199
00:13:56,398 --> 00:13:59,629
- Why? I got pinched.
- Everyone does, but you did it right.

200
00:13:59,758 --> 00:14:02,477
- You told them nothing.
- I thought you'd be mad.

201
00:14:02,638 --> 00:14:04,708
I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.

202
00:14:05,038 --> 00:14:06,756
You took your first pinch like a man...

203
00:14:06,838 --> 00:14:09,477
...and learned the two greatest things
in life.

204
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:11,913
Look at me.

205
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:13,989
Never rat on your friends...

206
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:16,468
...and always keep your mouth shut.

207
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:20,871
Here he is!

208
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:23,189
You broke your cherry!

209
00:14:29,838 --> 00:14:31,430
Congratulations!

210
00:15:04,798 --> 00:15:08,234
<i>By the time I grew up,</i>
<i>there was 30 billion a year in cargo...</i>

211
00:15:08,478 --> 00:15:12,949
<i>... moving through Idlewild Airport,</i>
<i>and we tried to steal every bit of it.</i>

212
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:15,507
<i>See, we grew up near the airport.</i>

213
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:19,831
<i>It belonged to Paulie. We had friends</i>
<i>and relatives who worked all over it.</i>

214
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,832
<i>They would tip us off about what</i>
<i>was coming in and moving out.</i>

215
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:26,797
<i>If any truckers or airlines gave us trouble...</i>

216
00:15:27,038 --> 00:15:30,872
<i>... Paulie's union people scared them</i>
<i>with a strike. It was beautiful.</i>

217
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:34,872
<i>It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers</i>
<i>and Jimmy was in charge.</i>

218
00:15:35,118 --> 00:15:37,757
<i>Whenever we needed money,</i>
<i>we'd rob the airport.</i>

219
00:15:37,918 --> 00:15:40,227
<i>To us, it was better than Citibank.</i>

220
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:52,834
You got a phone? Come on!

221
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,316
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you fucking believe that shit?

222
00:16:01,678 --> 00:16:03,828
<i>There was Jimmy and Tommy...</i>

223
00:16:04,158 --> 00:16:05,227
<i>... and me.</i>

224
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:07,588
<i>And there was Anthony Stabile.</i>

225
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:10,230
<i>Frankie Carbone.</i>

226
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:15,355
<i>And then there was Mo Black's brother,</i>
<i>Fat Andy.</i>

227
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:18,547
<i>And his guys, Frankie the Wop...</i>

228
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:21,749
<i>... and Freddy No Nose.</i>

229
00:16:23,118 --> 00:16:26,952
<i>And then there was Pete the Killer,</i>
<i>who was Sally Balls' brother.</i>

230
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:31,188
<i>Then you had Nickey Eyes...</i>

231
00:16:32,398 --> 00:16:34,229
<i>... and Mikey Franzese.</i>

232
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:39,034
<i>Jimmy Two-Times, nicknamed</i>
<i>because he said everything twice.</i>

233
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:41,667
I'll get the papers, get the papers.

234
00:16:53,438 --> 00:16:56,748
What is this? Coats?
I need suits, Henry, not coats.

235
00:16:57,598 --> 00:16:59,031
Suits are up on Thursday.

236
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:02,155
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?

237
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,388
You don't want furs? I'll take them away.

238
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:08,391
No, I want them. We'll hang them
in the freezer with the meat.

239
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:11,358
<i>For us, to live any other way was nuts.</i>

240
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:15,591
<i>To us, those goody-good people who</i>
<i>worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks...</i>

241
00:17:15,758 --> 00:17:19,592
<i>... and took the subway to work and</i>
<i>worried about bills, were dead.</i>

242
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,398
<i>They were suckers. They had no balls.</i>

243
00:17:22,638 --> 00:17:24,947
<i>If we wanted something, we just took it.</i>

244
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,270
<i>If anyone complained twice, they got</i>
<i>hit so bad they never complained again.</i>

245
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:32,874
<i>It was all just routine.</i>
<i>You didn't even think about it.</i>

246
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:36,868
Frankie, what the fuck does 520...

247
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,630
...have to do with 469?

248
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:43,431
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?

249
00:17:47,118 --> 00:17:51,430
Piece of cake. Don't worry about
the alarms. I just got to get a key.

250
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:53,794
- No problems?
- I'll take care of it.

251
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:04,509
- Tell him what you were telling me.
- Too good to be true.

252
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:09,667
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.

253
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:14,710
Americans change their money over
into French money and send it back here.

254
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,028
- Calm down.
- It's beautiful.

255
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:19,952
It's totally, totally untraceable.

256
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,197
Our only problem is getting a key,
but I got a plan.

257
00:18:23,278 --> 00:18:26,634
- Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
- Yeah, he's a piece of work.

258
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,552
If I'm right, there could be
half a mil coming in, all cash.

259
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:35,114
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.

260
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:39,510
There's a Jewish holiday Monday. They
won't find out until Tuesday. Beautiful.

261
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:41,350
What about the security?

262
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:42,713
Security?

263
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:47,271
You're looking at it. It's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.

264
00:18:47,678 --> 00:18:50,556
He just comes in like
he's picking up lost baggage.

265
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:53,106
- It's beautiful.
- It won't be a problem at all.

266
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,790
- Good.
- We're on.

267
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:59,113
What's really funny is that
fucking bank job in Secaucus.

268
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:01,269
I'm in the weeds lying down.

269
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:03,713
He said, "What are you doing?"
I said, "Resting."

270
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:04,787
"Here?"

271
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:07,870
"This ain't no beach or park."
"I'm resting!" I said.

272
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:11,595
He pulls me in, starts asking questions.
You know, this and that.

273
00:19:11,678 --> 00:19:14,954
"What are you going to tell us?"
I said, "My usual. Nothing."

274
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,350
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,
"No, you'll tell me something today."

275
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:21,986
I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother."

276
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:28,670
You saw the paper, Anthony.
My head was out like this.

277
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:32,995
I'm coming around and who do I see
in front of me?

278
00:19:33,198 --> 00:19:36,110
This prick again. He says,
"What do you want to tell me now?"

279
00:19:36,198 --> 00:19:39,713
I said, "What are you doing here?
I said to go fuck your mother."

280
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:42,790
I thought he'd shit.

281
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:48,636
The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.

282
00:19:52,398 --> 00:19:54,468
Funny. You're really funny.

283
00:19:55,918 --> 00:19:57,829
What do you mean, I'm funny?

284
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:00,717
It's funny, you know. It's a good story.

285
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,630
You're a funny guy.

286
00:20:03,438 --> 00:20:05,668
You mean the way I talk? What?

287
00:20:06,478 --> 00:20:09,231
It's just, you know. You're just funny.

288
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:12,388
You know, the way you tell the story.

289
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:15,072
Funny how? What's funny about it?

290
00:20:15,678 --> 00:20:17,987
- Tommy, you got it all wrong.
- Anthony...

291
00:20:18,398 --> 00:20:21,674
He's a big boy. He knows what he said.
Funny, how?

292
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,788
Just, you know. You're funny.

293
00:20:27,198 --> 00:20:28,870
Let me understand this.

294
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:30,949
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.

295
00:20:31,278 --> 00:20:34,588
But, I'm funny, how? Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?

296
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:37,757
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?

297
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:40,398
What do you mean, funny?
How am I funny?

298
00:20:43,758 --> 00:20:45,828
You know, how you tell a story.

299
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:49,676
No, I don't know. You said it.
You said I'm funny.

300
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:53,274
How am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?

301
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:55,431
Tell me what's funny!

302
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:02,708
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.

303
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:05,507
Motherfucker! I almost had him!

304
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:08,389
You stuttering prick, you!

305
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:10,436
Frankie, was he shaking?

306
00:21:11,758 --> 00:21:15,592
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning!

307
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:24,234
What's with you?
I thought I was getting pinched already.

308
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:27,629
He's on my neck like a vulture.
What do you want?

309
00:21:28,158 --> 00:21:31,036
This guy didn't want to give you the check.

310
00:21:31,598 --> 00:21:33,031
Could you take care of this?

311
00:21:33,118 --> 00:21:35,678
No problem. Tell him to put it on my tab.

312
00:21:35,918 --> 00:21:37,749
That's what I want to talk to you about.

313
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:41,308
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.

314
00:21:41,598 --> 00:21:45,352
$7,000, that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order...

315
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:48,874
It's good you don't like to be out of order,
Sonny.

316
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:52,828
Embarrassing me in front of my friends,
like I'm a deadbeat.

317
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,394
You're a mutt. You know the money
we spend in this fucking...

318
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:58,628
- Don't be like that.
- Like what?

319
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:06,952
Do you believe this prick?

320
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:08,994
You think this is funny?

321
00:22:11,438 --> 00:22:14,748
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!

322
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:17,834
You don't want to bring the check?

323
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:21,110
Do you believe this prick?

324
00:22:24,078 --> 00:22:26,638
You're supposed to be doing this stuff, too.

325
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:28,390
You're a funny guy.

326
00:22:29,358 --> 00:22:30,791
That's it, Henry!

327
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:36,028
You want to laugh?
This prick asked me to christen his kid.

328
00:22:37,998 --> 00:22:39,795
I charged him $7,000.

329
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:44,708
You really are a funny guy.

330
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,752
I'm worried. I'm hearing bad things.

331
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:53,508
He treats me like I'm a fucking fag.

332
00:22:53,678 --> 00:22:56,829
I got to go on the lam
to get away from this guy.

333
00:22:57,278 --> 00:22:59,917
This ain't right. I can't go here or there.

334
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,275
I talk to them a million times.
They don't listen.

335
00:23:03,678 --> 00:23:07,353
If you tell him, he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared M.I.A.

336
00:23:07,598 --> 00:23:09,828
They'll find me in a car in the weeds.

337
00:23:09,998 --> 00:23:12,228
You've known this Tommy all your life.

338
00:23:12,398 --> 00:23:14,468
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.

339
00:23:14,638 --> 00:23:18,313
When I leave my house in the morning
I look over both shoulders.

340
00:23:18,478 --> 00:23:21,470
This is no way to live. I'm no fence jumper.

341
00:23:21,838 --> 00:23:25,035
- Tell me what to do, I'll do it.
- What could I do?

342
00:23:25,918 --> 00:23:30,150
If there was something I could do,
I would. I'd like to help you out.

343
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,029
Tell him what we talked about.

344
00:23:36,158 --> 00:23:40,709
Maybe you could come in with me,
take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.

345
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:42,472
What are you talking about?

346
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:44,196
You mean the restaurant?

347
00:23:45,198 --> 00:23:46,950
It's a classy place.

348
00:23:47,118 --> 00:23:49,632
You've been in here a million times.

349
00:23:50,318 --> 00:23:53,833
Tommy taking over this joint
is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

350
00:23:53,998 --> 00:23:57,434
I don't mean any disrespect,
but that's the way it is.

351
00:23:58,238 --> 00:24:00,468
I'm begging you. What can I say?

352
00:24:00,718 --> 00:24:03,869
What am I going to do?
What does he want from me?

353
00:24:04,238 --> 00:24:07,548
I don't know anything about
the restaurant business.

354
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:10,637
All I know is how to sit down
and order a meal.

355
00:24:10,878 --> 00:24:12,994
Not for you. Just a place to hang.

356
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:17,589
The chef is great. The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.

357
00:24:17,838 --> 00:24:19,510
What do you want from me?

358
00:24:19,598 --> 00:24:23,113
Tommy's a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?

359
00:24:23,358 --> 00:24:25,269
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

360
00:24:30,158 --> 00:24:34,310
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it.
It's just that he's scaring me.

361
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,026
I just need help. Help me, please.

362
00:24:37,758 --> 00:24:39,988
Know anything about
the restaurant business?

363
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,546
He knows everything.
He's there day and night.

364
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:45,789
Another fucking few minutes,
he could be a stool.

365
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,030
You want me to be your partner?

366
00:24:49,118 --> 00:24:51,029
Is that what you're telling me?

367
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,315
What do you think I'm talking about?
Paulie, please.

368
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:56,071
It's not even fair.

369
00:24:56,798 --> 00:24:58,231
You don't understand.

370
00:24:58,318 --> 00:25:01,310
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you.

371
00:25:02,318 --> 00:25:05,674
God bless you, Paulie.
You've always been fair with me.

372
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:09,831
<i>Now he's got Paulie as a partner.</i>
<i>Any problems, he goes to Paulie.</i>

373
00:25:10,078 --> 00:25:12,069
<i>Trouble with a bill, he goes to Paulie.</i>

374
00:25:12,158 --> 00:25:14,467
<i>Trouble with the cops, deliveries, Tommy...</i>

375
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:17,595
<i>... he calls Paulie.</i>
<i>But now he has to pay Paulie...</i>

376
00:25:17,678 --> 00:25:19,555
<i>... every week no matter what.</i>

377
00:25:19,678 --> 00:25:23,591
<i>"Business is bad? Fuck you, pay me.</i>
<i>Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me. "</i>

378
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:27,114
<i>"The place got hit by lightning?</i>
<i>Fuck you, pay me. "</i>

379
00:25:28,878 --> 00:25:32,712
<i>Also, Paulie could do anything.</i>
<i>Like run up bills on the joint's credit.</i>

380
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:35,438
<i>And why not?</i>
<i>Nobody will pay for it anyway.</i>

381
00:25:35,678 --> 00:25:40,115
<i>Take deliveries at the front door</i>
<i>and sell it out the back at a discount.</i>

382
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:43,277
<i>Take a $200 case of booze</i>
<i>and sell it for $100.</i>

383
00:25:43,758 --> 00:25:45,988
<i>It doesn't matter. It's all profit.</i>

384
00:25:47,918 --> 00:25:50,751
<i>Then finally, when there's nothing left...</i>

385
00:25:51,438 --> 00:25:54,794
<i>... when you can't borrow</i>
<i>another buck from the bank...</i>

386
00:25:55,758 --> 00:25:58,477
<i>... you bust the joint out.</i>
<i>You light a match.</i>

387
00:25:58,718 --> 00:26:00,231
Do you need help reaching anything?

388
00:26:00,318 --> 00:26:03,355
You look like you're
decorating a Christmas tree.

389
00:26:07,438 --> 00:26:09,156
She's from the Five Towns.

390
00:26:09,638 --> 00:26:10,707
Who?

391
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:13,429
The Jew broad. Diane.

392
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,556
I been trying to bang her for a month.
She won't go out with me alone.

393
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:21,991
- No.
- No, what?

394
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:25,348
No, what? Who asked you anything?

395
00:26:25,438 --> 00:26:27,588
Wait to hear what I'm going to say.

396
00:26:27,758 --> 00:26:29,077
All right, what?

397
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:35,349
She won't go out with Italians alone.
She's prejudiced against Italians.

398
00:26:35,758 --> 00:26:40,229
You fucking believe that? In this day
and age? What is this world coming to?

399
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:45,157
I can't believe this. A Jew broad,
prejudiced against Italians.

400
00:26:45,998 --> 00:26:50,310
She won't go out without her girlfriend.
So you come along for her friend.

401
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:52,628
See? I knew it. I knew it.

402
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:54,868
What the fuck is wrong with that?

403
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:57,108
- When is it?
- Tomorrow night.

404
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,631
I'm meeting Tuddy.

405
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:01,358
You could meet Tuddy.
Come early and then go.

406
00:27:01,678 --> 00:27:04,067
- Why do you always do this?
- Don't give me that shit.

407
00:27:04,158 --> 00:27:08,276
What did I ask you for? A favor.
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.

408
00:27:08,478 --> 00:27:11,038
I'm trying to bang this broad. Help me out.

409
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:15,267
I don't understand you. She's beautiful!

410
00:27:15,358 --> 00:27:18,714
Her family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.

411
00:27:18,878 --> 00:27:23,190
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.

412
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:25,428
You with your fucking mouth!

413
00:27:29,998 --> 00:27:34,276
<i>I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11:00</i>
<i>and here I am a backup guy for Tommy.</i>

414
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:36,150
Did you have enough to eat?

415
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:39,230
It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.

416
00:27:39,598 --> 00:27:40,951
Let me watch your figure.

417
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:45,111
<i>I couldn't wait to go. I was ordering</i>
<i>dessert when they were eating dinner.</i>

418
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:48,429
<i>When they were having coffee,</i>
<i>I was asking for the check.</i>

419
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:51,028
Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.

420
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:54,150
Joe, can we have the check?

421
00:27:54,318 --> 00:27:55,671
What are you doing?

422
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:57,988
- I got to go.
- We just got here.

423
00:27:58,158 --> 00:27:59,511
I got that thing.

424
00:28:00,238 --> 00:28:02,035
We'll leave together.

425
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,754
This way we don't go out
like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.

426
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:08,230
<i>I couldn't stand him.</i>

427
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:12,312
<i>I thought he was really obnoxious.</i>
<i>He kept fidgeting around.</i>

428
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:16,636
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.

429
00:28:19,118 --> 00:28:23,396
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz,
but it'd look funny on my table.

430
00:28:25,678 --> 00:28:27,031
- Ready?
- Lighten up.

431
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:29,678
We just got here. What are you doing?

432
00:28:30,318 --> 00:28:33,833
<i>Before it was time to go,</i>
<i>he was pushing me into the car...</i>

433
00:28:33,998 --> 00:28:36,876
<i>... then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.</i>

434
00:28:37,838 --> 00:28:41,467
<i>Diane and Tommy made us promise</i>
<i>to meet them again on Friday.</i>

435
00:28:41,838 --> 00:28:43,112
<i>We agreed.</i>

436
00:28:43,358 --> 00:28:46,395
<i>But when Friday came around,</i>
<i>Henry stood me up.</i>

437
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:49,916
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.

438
00:28:50,238 --> 00:28:52,957
He really liked you.
All he did was talk about her.

439
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:55,347
<i>We were a trio instead of a double date.</i>

440
00:28:55,438 --> 00:28:58,475
He should have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.

441
00:28:58,638 --> 00:29:01,391
<i>But I made Tommy take me</i>
<i>looking for him.</i>

442
00:29:05,678 --> 00:29:07,270
Tommy, what the fuck?

443
00:29:07,438 --> 00:29:09,872
You got some nerve standing me up.

444
00:29:10,318 --> 00:29:11,831
Nobody does that to me.

445
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:15,115
Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some big shot?

446
00:29:16,718 --> 00:29:18,948
I forgot. I thought it was next week.

447
00:29:19,118 --> 00:29:22,428
It was this Friday and you agreed,
so you're a liar!

448
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:24,870
We can talk about this.

449
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:27,791
Talk to you after what you just did to me?

450
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:29,992
Forget it.

451
00:29:30,238 --> 00:29:34,470
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored. You didn't say anything.

452
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:38,950
Let me make it up to you.

453
00:29:39,118 --> 00:29:40,471
I'll think about it.

454
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:43,914
<i>I remember, she was screaming</i>
<i>on the street and I mean loud.</i>

455
00:29:44,078 --> 00:29:46,228
- <i>But she looked good.</i>
- I'll think about it.

456
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,707
But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.

457
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:52,156
<i>She had these great eyes</i>
<i>just like Liz Taylor's.</i>

458
00:29:54,838 --> 00:29:55,827
Hello, Henry.

459
00:29:55,918 --> 00:29:57,112
- Ready?
- Yeah.

460
00:29:57,198 --> 00:29:58,153
Come on.

461
00:29:58,238 --> 00:29:59,751
- Wait a minute.
- What?

462
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:03,595
You have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that...

463
00:30:04,878 --> 00:30:05,833
Mom.

464
00:30:05,998 --> 00:30:07,829
Meet my friend, Henry Hill.

465
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:12,032
My daughter says you're half Jewish.

466
00:30:13,198 --> 00:30:14,790
It's just the good half.

467
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:17,831
See you later.

468
00:30:18,078 --> 00:30:20,034
You're leaving your car?

469
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:22,070
He watches the car for me.

470
00:30:22,158 --> 00:30:24,547
It's easier than leaving it at a garage.

471
00:30:24,878 --> 00:30:27,028
It's a lot quicker that way.

472
00:30:34,158 --> 00:30:37,389
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.

473
00:30:41,998 --> 00:30:44,831
How are you doin'? What's up?
Here you go.

474
00:30:51,838 --> 00:30:54,432
- How are you doin', Gino?
- Good. How are you?

475
00:30:57,838 --> 00:31:01,308
Every time I come here,
I see you two. Don't you work?

476
00:31:50,318 --> 00:31:53,116
Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?

477
00:31:53,438 --> 00:31:55,269
Anthony, right in the front.

478
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:57,668
Anything you need, let me know.

479
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:17,508
Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

480
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:27,269
You gave them $20 each.

481
00:32:28,078 --> 00:32:30,876
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.

482
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:32,232
- Where?
- Over there.

483
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:33,751
Thanks a lot, Tony.

484
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,596
- What do you do?
- What?

485
00:32:39,438 --> 00:32:41,668
- What do you do?
- I'm in construction.

486
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:46,398
They don't feel like you're in construction.

487
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:48,071
I'm a union delegate.

488
00:32:49,358 --> 00:32:50,791
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

489
00:32:50,878 --> 00:32:54,791
<i>... the Copacabana is proud to present</i>
<i>the king of one-liners...</i>

490
00:32:55,438 --> 00:32:57,030
<i>... Henry Youngman.</i>

491
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:06,952
How are you all? I'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.

492
00:33:08,718 --> 00:33:11,676
I take my wife everywhere
but she finds her way home.

493
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,147
<i>I said, "Where do you wanna go</i>
<i>for our anniversary?"</i>

494
00:33:16,238 --> 00:33:18,274
<i>She said,</i>
<i>"Somewhere I've never been before."</i>

495
00:33:18,358 --> 00:33:20,110
<i>I said, "Try the kitchen."</i>

496
00:33:21,358 --> 00:33:22,871
<i>Dr. Wellsler is here.</i>

497
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:25,427
<i>Gave a guy six months to live.</i>
<i>Couldn't pay his bill.</i>

498
00:33:25,518 --> 00:33:27,349
<i>Gave him another six months.</i>

499
00:33:29,678 --> 00:33:31,350
<i>I love this crowd.</i>

500
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:47,076
<i>Air France made me.</i>

501
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,475
<i>We walked out with $420,000</i>
<i>without using a gun.</i>

502
00:33:51,118 --> 00:33:54,155
<i>And we did the right thing.</i>
<i>We gave Paulie his tribute.</i>

503
00:33:58,798 --> 00:33:59,992
Sixty thousand.

504
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:02,514
It's going to be a good summer.

505
00:34:05,598 --> 00:34:09,034
I'm proud of you.
That is a lot of money for a kid like you.

506
00:34:09,278 --> 00:34:13,032
Anybody asks you where you got it,
you got it in Vegas playing craps.

507
00:34:15,998 --> 00:34:17,113
Check, sir.

508
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,628
No. You have to sign for it here.

509
00:34:23,678 --> 00:34:25,031
Should I tip him?

510
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:35,075
- How are you?
- Okay. And you?

511
00:34:36,718 --> 00:34:39,471
- Henry, this is Bruce.
- Good to meet you.

512
00:34:43,038 --> 00:34:44,756
I'll see you around later.

513
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:50,473
Do you know him?

514
00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:51,434
Yeah.

515
00:34:51,638 --> 00:34:53,390
He lives across the street.

516
00:34:56,638 --> 00:34:58,469
"Roses are red, my love

517
00:35:01,118 --> 00:35:02,710
"Violets are blue

518
00:35:05,678 --> 00:35:07,589
"Sugar is sweet, my love

519
00:35:08,718 --> 00:35:10,629
"But not as sweet as you"

520
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:21,796
<i>One night, Bobby Vinton sent us</i>
<i>champagne. There was nothing like it.</i>

521
00:35:22,318 --> 00:35:25,594
<i>I didn't think there was</i>
<i>anything strange in any of this.</i>

522
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:28,227
<i>A 21-year-old kid with such connections.</i>

523
00:35:31,118 --> 00:35:33,029
<i>He was an exciting guy.</i>

524
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:36,875
<i>He was really nice.</i>
<i>He introduced me to everybody.</i>

525
00:35:37,998 --> 00:35:40,387
<i>Everybody wanted to be nice to him.</i>

526
00:35:40,878 --> 00:35:42,709
<i>He knew how to handle it.</i>

527
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,866
<i>Don't buy wigs that come off</i>
<i>at the wrong time.</i>

528
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:54,949
<i>Morrie's wigs don't come off!</i>

529
00:35:55,438 --> 00:35:56,757
<i>Even underwater.</i>

530
00:35:56,878 --> 00:36:00,791
<i>And remember, Morrie's wigs are tested</i>
<i>against hurricane winds.</i>

531
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:04,475
<i>Forget about money.</i>
<i>You can afford a Morrie wig.</i>

532
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,437
<i>Call me now!</i>

533
00:36:07,758 --> 00:36:10,226
<i>Come in for a personalized fitting.</i>

534
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,306
Morrie, Jimmy's waiting. You're past due.

535
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:18,230
I've been good to you.

536
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:21,435
But there's something
unreasonable going on here.

537
00:36:21,678 --> 00:36:23,748
Jimmy's being a ball breaker.

538
00:36:23,918 --> 00:36:25,795
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.

539
00:36:25,998 --> 00:36:28,831
I never had to pay
the vigorish he demands.

540
00:36:29,678 --> 00:36:31,191
What am I, a schmuck?

541
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:33,829
You borrowed his money. Pay him.

542
00:36:33,918 --> 00:36:36,068
I didn't agree to three points above the vig.

543
00:36:36,158 --> 00:36:38,991
What are you going to do?
Going to fight with Jimmy Conway?

544
00:36:39,078 --> 00:36:41,467
He wants his money.
Give him his money and we'll go!

545
00:36:41,558 --> 00:36:42,308
Fuck him!

546
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:45,435
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!

547
00:36:45,758 --> 00:36:47,191
Did I ever bust his balls?

548
00:36:47,278 --> 00:36:49,746
I could've dropped a dime a million times.

549
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:52,716
Don't call the cops. You're talking crazy.

550
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:55,588
You got money for that commercial!

551
00:36:55,758 --> 00:36:58,033
You don't got my fucking money?

552
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:00,676
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.

553
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:04,154
I'll fucking kill you!
Give me the money, cocksucker.

554
00:37:04,398 --> 00:37:05,513
Pay me!

555
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:07,635
He'll pay, he'll pay.

556
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:11,628
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.
Jimmy, I'm sorry.

557
00:37:13,118 --> 00:37:17,191
You should be sorry. Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!

558
00:37:17,678 --> 00:37:20,238
You hear me? Give me the fucking money!

559
00:37:20,398 --> 00:37:24,073
I'll give you... You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.

560
00:37:24,238 --> 00:37:25,876
Karen, slow down.

561
00:37:27,438 --> 00:37:29,747
Where? Stay there. Don't move.

562
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:32,233
It's Karen.

563
00:37:44,398 --> 00:37:45,672
What happened?

564
00:37:45,998 --> 00:37:48,432
What happened? Are you all right?

565
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:50,232
Who did it?

566
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:54,915
This guy who lives across the street
from me that I've known all my life.

567
00:37:59,598 --> 00:38:02,271
He started to touch me. He grabbed me.

568
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:05,472
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.

569
00:38:05,758 --> 00:38:08,716
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.

570
00:38:11,438 --> 00:38:13,588
He pushed me out of the car.

571
00:38:20,718 --> 00:38:22,436
You sure you're all right?

572
00:38:25,598 --> 00:38:29,034
Why don't you go inside
and get yourself together. Clean up.

573
00:38:49,198 --> 00:38:51,154
What do you want, fucko?

574
00:38:58,398 --> 00:39:01,993
I swear on my mother,
if you touch her again, you're dead.

575
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,032
Don't shoot.

576
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:26,509
Hide this. Are you all right?
Are you all right?

577
00:39:31,278 --> 00:39:33,109
<i>I know there are women...</i>

578
00:39:33,198 --> 00:39:36,395
<i>... who would have gotten out</i>
<i>the minute their boyfriend...</i>

579
00:39:36,478 --> 00:39:39,311
<i>... gave them a gun to hide. But I didn't.</i>

580
00:39:40,558 --> 00:39:43,277
<i>I got to admit the truth: It turned me on.</i>

581
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:50,952
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

582
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:25,115
Why don't you be like Henry?
He's got a nice girl.

583
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:28,397
He's settling down now. He's married.

584
00:40:29,118 --> 00:40:31,188
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.

585
00:40:31,278 --> 00:40:34,554
And you're still bouncing around
from girl to girl.

586
00:40:42,478 --> 00:40:44,708
<i>It was like he had two families.</i>

587
00:40:45,038 --> 00:40:48,872
<i>The first time I was introduced</i>
<i>to all of them at once, it was crazy.</i>

588
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:52,235
<i>Paulie and his brothers had lots</i>
<i>of sons and nephews.</i>

589
00:40:52,878 --> 00:40:55,597
<i>Almost all of them were named</i>
<i>Peter or Paul.</i>

590
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,517
<i>It was unbelievable.</i>

591
00:40:58,638 --> 00:41:01,630
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.
And this is Petey.

592
00:41:02,158 --> 00:41:05,036
<i>There must have been two dozen</i>
<i>Peters and Pauls there...</i>

593
00:41:05,118 --> 00:41:06,312
This is Marie.

594
00:41:06,398 --> 00:41:08,707
<i>... all married to girls named Marie.</i>

595
00:41:09,518 --> 00:41:11,110
She looks Italian.

596
00:41:12,238 --> 00:41:14,672
<i>And they named all their daughters Marie.</i>

597
00:41:15,758 --> 00:41:19,353
And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie.
I get confused myself.

598
00:41:19,598 --> 00:41:22,874
<i>By the time I had met everybody,</i>
<i>I thought I was drunk.</i>

599
00:41:27,998 --> 00:41:30,068
Paulie, you shouldn't have.

600
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:33,796
Welcome to the family.

601
00:41:34,798 --> 00:41:35,833
Sunday dinner?

602
00:41:35,918 --> 00:41:38,113
So beautiful. I want to cry.

603
00:41:38,798 --> 00:41:41,187
Here's something to help you get started.

604
00:41:57,918 --> 00:41:59,795
- The bag. The bag.
- What bag?

605
00:42:01,758 --> 00:42:04,477
The bag with the envelopes in it,
all the money.

606
00:42:05,198 --> 00:42:07,917
Don't worry.
Nobody's going to steal that here.

607
00:42:37,518 --> 00:42:39,031
He didn't call?

608
00:42:39,438 --> 00:42:42,953
- He's with his friends.
- What kind of person doesn't call?

609
00:42:43,198 --> 00:42:46,235
He's a grown-up. He doesn't have to call
every five minutes.

610
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:48,878
A grown-up would get you an apartment.

611
00:42:49,118 --> 00:42:52,428
Don't start. Mom, you're the one
who wanted us here.

612
00:42:53,278 --> 00:42:56,714
You're here a month and sometimes I know
he doesn't come home at all.

613
00:42:56,798 --> 00:42:58,550
What kind of people are these?

614
00:42:58,638 --> 00:43:01,596
- What do you want me to do?
- What can you do?

615
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:05,513
He's not Jewish. Did you know
what these people were like?

616
00:43:06,158 --> 00:43:08,956
Your father never stayed out all night
without calling.

617
00:43:09,038 --> 00:43:12,155
Daddy never went out at all, Ma!
Keep out of it!

618
00:43:12,638 --> 00:43:14,549
You don't know how I feel!

619
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:18,553
How do you feel now? You don't
know where he is or who he's with!

620
00:43:18,718 --> 00:43:20,788
He's with his friends! Dad!

621
00:43:21,038 --> 00:43:23,347
Leave him alone. He's suffered enough.

622
00:43:23,438 --> 00:43:26,032
He hasn't digested a decent meal
in six weeks.

623
00:43:36,078 --> 00:43:38,672
Where were you? Why didn't you call?

624
00:43:39,598 --> 00:43:43,273
We were worried! A married man does not
stay out like this!

625
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:47,392
Normal people don't act like this!

626
00:43:48,718 --> 00:43:50,310
What's wrong with you?

627
00:43:50,798 --> 00:43:54,268
You're not normal. She's right!
What's wrong with you?

628
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,756
What kind of person are you?
What is the matter with you?

629
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:00,033
What kind of people are they?

630
00:44:03,118 --> 00:44:05,678
<i>We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.</i>

631
00:44:05,918 --> 00:44:08,637
<i>But the first time I realized how different...</i>

632
00:44:08,718 --> 00:44:11,027
<i>... was when Mickey had a hostess party.</i>

633
00:44:11,598 --> 00:44:13,987
- Karen, where you from?
- Lawrence.

634
00:44:14,398 --> 00:44:16,150
On the Island. Nice.

635
00:44:16,398 --> 00:44:18,468
I'm from Miami. Ever been there?

636
00:44:18,798 --> 00:44:22,108
It's okay, but it's like you died
and woke up in Jew heaven.

637
00:44:22,918 --> 00:44:24,431
Stop picking at that.

638
00:44:24,558 --> 00:44:26,310
I'd like to smack his face.

639
00:44:26,558 --> 00:44:27,911
The red-haired guy?

640
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,068
The guy's hands are all over me.

641
00:44:30,238 --> 00:44:34,026
So I told him, "Keep your fucking hands
off me, or I'll cut them off."

642
00:44:35,918 --> 00:44:37,351
She means it.

643
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:41,036
He's lucky. I just mention this to Vinnie...

644
00:44:41,198 --> 00:44:44,076
How can you mention it? Vinnie'd kill him.

645
00:44:44,718 --> 00:44:48,074
Vinnie'll kill the miserable bastard,
then he'll be there for life.

646
00:44:48,158 --> 00:44:50,718
Talk about problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?

647
00:44:50,798 --> 00:44:54,313
He was in an argument. A $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.

648
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:58,392
The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears...

649
00:44:58,558 --> 00:45:01,356
...she has a heart attack and drops dead.

650
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:06,470
Now Jeannie has a husband and son
in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

651
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:09,918
- Jeannie drinks.
- Maybe she's depressed.

652
00:45:10,758 --> 00:45:12,669
Give me a break. She's drunk.

653
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:16,746
As soon as something happens,
you make them out to be saints.

654
00:45:17,038 --> 00:45:21,429
<i>They had bad skin and wore too much</i>
<i>makeup. They didn't look very good.</i>

655
00:45:22,158 --> 00:45:24,991
<i>They looked beat-up.</i>
<i>And the stuff they wore...</i>

656
00:45:25,078 --> 00:45:26,716
<i>... was thrown together and cheap.</i>

657
00:45:26,798 --> 00:45:29,312
<i>A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.</i>

658
00:45:31,158 --> 00:45:32,955
She spends her life in a nightgown.

659
00:45:33,038 --> 00:45:35,188
The woman is no angel, believe me.

660
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:37,508
<i>They talked about their rotten kids...</i>

661
00:45:37,598 --> 00:45:40,556
<i>... and about beating them</i>
<i>with broom handles and belts.</i>

662
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:42,708
<i>And the kids still didn't listen.</i>

663
00:45:43,678 --> 00:45:45,908
<i>When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.</i>

664
00:45:46,158 --> 00:45:48,467
I don't know if I could live like that!

665
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:52,633
God forbid, what would happen
if you had to go to prison?

666
00:45:54,638 --> 00:45:56,788
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband...

667
00:45:57,038 --> 00:45:59,916
Do you know why Jeannie's
husband went to the can?

668
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:02,308
Because he wanted to get away from her.

669
00:46:02,398 --> 00:46:06,516
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.

670
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:09,268
Unless they make themselves get caught.

671
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:12,873
They don't have things organized.
I know what I'm doing.

672
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:18,550
You know who goes to jail? Nigger
stickup men. Know why they get caught?

673
00:46:18,798 --> 00:46:21,676
Because they fall asleep
in the getaway car.

674
00:46:21,998 --> 00:46:25,149
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.

675
00:46:31,758 --> 00:46:34,431
<i>After a while, it got to be all normal.</i>

676
00:46:35,118 --> 00:46:37,348
<i>None of it seemed like crimes.</i>

677
00:46:37,678 --> 00:46:39,589
<i>Henry was just enterprising.</i>

678
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,308
<i>He and the guys made bucks</i>
<i>hustling while other guys...</i>

679
00:46:43,598 --> 00:46:46,476
<i>... sat on their asses waiting for handouts.</i>

680
00:46:47,278 --> 00:46:50,793
<i>Our husbands weren't brain surgeons,</i>
<i>just blue-collar guys...</i>

681
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:55,556
<i>The only way they could make real extra</i>
<i>money was to go out and cut corners.</i>

682
00:46:55,918 --> 00:46:58,148
Where's the strong box, you varmint?

683
00:47:04,558 --> 00:47:06,867
Don't fucking move! Don't move!

684
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:18,386
- See you at the diner.
- I'm riding shotgun.

685
00:47:18,638 --> 00:47:20,868
Did you see him give it right over?

686
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:24,227
Back to the hideout to split up the loot.

687
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,989
<i>We were all very close.</i>

688
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:33,833
<i>There were never any outsiders around.</i>
<i>Absolutely never.</i>

689
00:47:34,478 --> 00:47:38,710
<i>Being together all the time made</i>
<i>everything seem all the more normal.</i>

690
00:47:39,238 --> 00:47:39,988
Police.

691
00:47:40,078 --> 00:47:44,230
I'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective
Silvestri. We have a search warrant.

692
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:46,070
Would you read and sign it?

693
00:47:46,638 --> 00:47:47,673
Anywhere?

694
00:47:48,238 --> 00:47:50,308
We have to go through everything.

695
00:47:50,558 --> 00:47:52,150
You want some coffee?

696
00:47:52,398 --> 00:47:54,150
No coffee now, thanks.

697
00:47:54,478 --> 00:47:57,515
- Be careful.
- We'll just go about our business.

698
00:47:57,918 --> 00:48:00,148
<i>There was always a little harassment.</i>

699
00:48:00,398 --> 00:48:03,117
<i>They wanted to talk to Henry</i>
<i>about this or that.</i>

700
00:48:03,278 --> 00:48:06,156
<i>They'd make me sign</i>
<i>their subpoenas or warrants.</i>

701
00:48:06,398 --> 00:48:08,787
<i>But mostly they just wanted a handout.</i>

702
00:48:09,038 --> 00:48:12,269
<i>A few bucks to keep things quiet</i>
<i>no matter what they found.</i>

703
00:48:17,198 --> 00:48:21,510
<i>I always asked if they wanted coffee.</i>
<i>Some wives, like Mickey Conway...</i>

704
00:48:22,158 --> 00:48:24,797
<i>... used to curse at them</i>
<i>and spit on the floor.</i>

705
00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:28,075
<i>On her own floor!</i>
<i>That never made any sense to me.</i>

706
00:48:28,558 --> 00:48:31,277
<i>It was better to be polite</i>
<i>and call the lawyer.</i>

707
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:37,749
"Happy birthday to you"

708
00:48:40,158 --> 00:48:44,310
<i>We always did everything together</i>
<i>and were always in the same crowd.</i>

709
00:48:44,718 --> 00:48:48,711
<i>Anniversaries, christenings.</i>
<i>We only went to each other's houses.</i>

710
00:48:50,558 --> 00:48:51,911
<i>The women played cards.</i>

711
00:48:51,998 --> 00:48:55,752
<i>When kids were born, Mickey and</i>
<i>Jimmy were the first at the hospital.</i>

712
00:48:55,998 --> 00:48:59,195
<i>When we went to the Islands</i>
<i>or Vegas for vacation...</i>

713
00:48:59,518 --> 00:49:00,553
<i>... we went together.</i>

714
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:03,391
<i>No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.</i>

715
00:49:03,678 --> 00:49:07,796
<i>I began to be proud that my husband</i>
<i>was willing to risk his neck...</i>

716
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:10,388
<i>... to get us the little extras.</i>

717
00:49:10,558 --> 00:49:13,709
But I got Mom to watch the babies
tomorrow night.

718
00:49:14,238 --> 00:49:15,990
- Can't do it.
- Why not?

719
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:19,037
I just can't. I got something lined up.

720
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:22,236
But tomorrow's the only night
she can do it.

721
00:49:22,558 --> 00:49:25,914
- Pretty please?
- I can't. What do you want me to do?

722
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:29,428
- I got to go.
- Wait a minute.

723
00:49:30,398 --> 00:49:32,468
I need money to go shopping.

724
00:49:32,798 --> 00:49:34,072
How much?

725
00:49:37,118 --> 00:49:38,437
That much.

726
00:49:42,558 --> 00:49:44,628
This much. Give me a kiss.

727
00:49:48,798 --> 00:49:49,992
See you later.

728
00:49:55,198 --> 00:49:56,472
All right.

729
00:49:57,438 --> 00:50:00,589
<i>"I always dreamed the boy I love</i>
<i>would come along</i>

730
00:50:01,438 --> 00:50:04,316
<i>"And he'd be tall and handsome,</i>
<i>rich and strong"</i>

731
00:50:27,198 --> 00:50:28,790
Welcome home, Batts.

732
00:50:31,078 --> 00:50:32,716
Hi there. How are you?

733
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:35,995
Sit down. Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.

734
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:39,073
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.

735
00:50:39,198 --> 00:50:41,029
There's only one Irishman here.

736
00:50:41,118 --> 00:50:42,836
It's a celebration.

737
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:45,826
- Top of the morning.
- It's good to be home.

738
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:51,910
This is my friend Jimmy.

739
00:50:51,998 --> 00:50:54,387
Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.

740
00:50:55,838 --> 00:50:57,351
Tommy. All dressed up.

741
00:50:57,438 --> 00:50:59,747
All grown up and doing the town.

742
00:51:00,638 --> 00:51:02,947
Forgot you were having a party for him.

743
00:51:03,998 --> 00:51:05,272
Come here.

744
00:51:05,678 --> 00:51:07,828
I'll say hello. How are you, Billy?

745
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,228
I haven't seen you in six years.

746
00:51:10,718 --> 00:51:13,551
Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.

747
00:51:14,478 --> 00:51:15,752
Watch the suit.

748
00:51:15,918 --> 00:51:18,955
You little prick. I've known you all my life.

749
00:51:19,998 --> 00:51:23,035
- Don't get too big on me.
- Just don't bust my balls.

750
00:51:23,678 --> 00:51:27,273
If I was gonna break your balls,
I'd say, "Go get your shine box."

751
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:31,076
This kid was great.

752
00:51:31,518 --> 00:51:33,509
I used to call him "Spitshine Tommy."

753
00:51:33,598 --> 00:51:37,432
He'd make your shoes look like
fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.

754
00:51:37,758 --> 00:51:40,147
He was the best. Made a lot of money.

755
00:51:42,718 --> 00:51:43,992
No more shines.

756
00:51:45,198 --> 00:51:46,313
No more shines.

757
00:51:46,398 --> 00:51:49,117
You been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.

758
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:51,189
I don't shine shoes anymore.

759
00:51:51,678 --> 00:51:55,671
Relax. What's got into you?
I'm breaking your balls a little, that's all.

760
00:51:55,758 --> 00:51:56,952
I'm only kidding with you.

761
00:51:57,038 --> 00:52:00,235
Sometimes you don't sound like it.
There's a lot of people around.

762
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:02,468
I'm only kidding. We're having a party.

763
00:52:02,558 --> 00:52:06,233
I haven't seen you in a long time
and you get fucking fresh.

764
00:52:06,398 --> 00:52:08,309
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

765
00:52:08,398 --> 00:52:09,911
I'm sorry, too.

766
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:17,348
Now go home and get your fucking
shine box.

767
00:52:17,438 --> 00:52:19,156
Motherfucking mutt!

768
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:21,316
You fucking piece of shit!

769
00:52:21,918 --> 00:52:23,510
Come on, come on!

770
00:52:23,998 --> 00:52:27,354
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!

771
00:52:27,598 --> 00:52:29,748
You bought your fucking button!

772
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:31,988
- Don't get nervous.
- You motherfucker!

773
00:52:32,078 --> 00:52:34,911
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here!

774
00:52:36,398 --> 00:52:38,309
Come on, you fucking feel strong?

775
00:52:38,398 --> 00:52:41,754
Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

776
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:44,227
He doesn't mean any disrespect?
Are you nuts?

777
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:47,754
Teach this kid a little fucking manners!
What's right is right.

778
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:50,068
- You understand what I'm saying?
- It's alright.

779
00:52:50,158 --> 00:52:54,549
We're hugging and kissing over here
and then he acts like a fucking jerk.

780
00:52:56,238 --> 00:52:59,116
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order.

781
00:52:59,198 --> 00:53:01,428
- I didn't.
- You insulted him a little.

782
00:53:01,598 --> 00:53:04,351
- I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink.
- Okay.

783
00:53:05,118 --> 00:53:07,109
Let's have some drinks.
Drinks on the house.

784
00:53:07,198 --> 00:53:08,950
No, have the drink with me.

785
00:53:10,558 --> 00:53:12,469
The drinks are on the house.

786
00:53:13,198 --> 00:53:16,235
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.

787
00:53:17,118 --> 00:53:18,870
Fucking break up my party.

788
00:53:26,718 --> 00:53:29,027
You been away for six years.
It's different now.

789
00:53:29,118 --> 00:53:31,313
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.

790
00:53:32,078 --> 00:53:35,593
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got mouths to feed.

791
00:53:35,758 --> 00:53:37,988
- You're gonna get it.
- You understand?

792
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:43,032
Get the door!

793
00:53:57,438 --> 00:53:59,827
Let me shoot him
in his big, fucking mouth!

794
00:53:59,918 --> 00:54:01,237
Let's shoot him.

795
00:54:18,398 --> 00:54:20,309
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.

796
00:54:20,558 --> 00:54:22,708
His crew'll be looking for him.

797
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:29,110
This is bad. What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.

798
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:32,953
I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him. More tablecloths.

799
00:54:33,278 --> 00:54:35,712
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.

800
00:54:39,518 --> 00:54:41,110
Go open your trunk.

801
00:54:45,438 --> 00:54:47,827
We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.

802
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:59,831
She has a shovel here somewhere.
Quiet, I don't want to wake her.

803
00:55:01,758 --> 00:55:03,350
Look who's here.

804
00:55:05,118 --> 00:55:06,551
What happened?

805
00:55:06,718 --> 00:55:09,437
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy'll tell you.

806
00:55:09,678 --> 00:55:11,475
What happened to him?

807
00:55:12,878 --> 00:55:16,188
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?

808
00:55:16,638 --> 00:55:18,390
You, too. How are you?

809
00:55:18,558 --> 00:55:19,991
Why are you up so late?

810
00:55:20,078 --> 00:55:23,070
He came in. You came in.
I'm so happy to see him.

811
00:55:24,118 --> 00:55:27,588
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.

812
00:55:27,678 --> 00:55:30,636
- Go to sleep. We're leaving.
- I can't. Not while he's home.

813
00:55:30,718 --> 00:55:33,027
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.

814
00:55:33,118 --> 00:55:33,834
You go inside.

815
00:55:33,918 --> 00:55:35,590
This stuff is like lead.

816
00:55:35,678 --> 00:55:38,556
Tell me, where you been?
I haven't seen you.

817
00:55:39,198 --> 00:55:41,758
You haven't called. Where have you been?

818
00:55:41,998 --> 00:55:43,670
I been working nights.

819
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:46,390
And tonight we were out late.

820
00:55:46,478 --> 00:55:49,629
We took a ride out to the country
and hit a deer.

821
00:55:50,478 --> 00:55:53,675
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.

822
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:58,389
It reminds me, I need this knife.
I'm taking this, okay? Just for a while.

823
00:55:58,718 --> 00:56:00,231
The poor thing.

824
00:56:00,478 --> 00:56:03,629
We hit the deer and his paw.
What do you call it?

825
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:05,347
The paw.

826
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:07,510
- The hoof.
- Got caught in the grill.

827
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:09,190
I got to hack it off.

828
00:56:10,238 --> 00:56:12,468
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.

829
00:56:12,718 --> 00:56:14,436
I'll bring the knife back.

830
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:16,117
Delicious.

831
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:19,108
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

832
00:56:19,198 --> 00:56:20,870
I do, almost every night.

833
00:56:21,038 --> 00:56:23,791
But get yourself a girl
so you could settle down.

834
00:56:23,918 --> 00:56:28,196
I do, every night. Then I'm free.
I love you! I want to be with you.

835
00:56:28,638 --> 00:56:29,912
Settle down.

836
00:56:31,678 --> 00:56:33,634
How's your friend Henry?

837
00:56:33,798 --> 00:56:35,675
What's the matter? You don't talk much.

838
00:56:35,758 --> 00:56:37,510
Talk. What are you quiet for?

839
00:56:37,598 --> 00:56:39,987
You don't eat much, you don't talk much.

840
00:56:40,238 --> 00:56:42,388
- I'm just listening.
- Something wrong?

841
00:56:42,478 --> 00:56:45,834
When we were kids,
the <i>compares</i> used to visit each other.

842
00:56:46,238 --> 00:56:50,629
There was this man. He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night.

843
00:56:51,198 --> 00:56:54,986
They say to him, "What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?"

844
00:56:55,918 --> 00:56:59,706
He says, "What am I going to say,
that my wife two-times me?"

845
00:57:00,158 --> 00:57:03,150
So she says, "Shut up!
You're always talking!"

846
00:57:05,278 --> 00:57:07,667
But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.

847
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:09,669
- <i>Cornuto contento.</i>
- That's it.

848
00:57:10,078 --> 00:57:12,546
It means he's content to be a jerk.

849
00:57:13,278 --> 00:57:15,473
He doesn't care who knows it.

850
00:57:15,998 --> 00:57:18,228
Did Tommy tell you about my painting?

851
00:57:19,518 --> 00:57:20,792
Look at this.

852
00:57:21,278 --> 00:57:22,506
It's beautiful.

853
00:57:22,638 --> 00:57:25,516
One dog goes one way
and the other goes the other.

854
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:27,988
One's facing east, the other west.

855
00:57:28,238 --> 00:57:31,992
He's saying, "What do you want from me?"
The guy's got a nice head of white hair.

856
00:57:32,078 --> 00:57:33,591
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.

857
00:57:33,678 --> 00:57:35,430
Looks like someone we know.

858
00:57:37,518 --> 00:57:39,509
Without the beard. It's him.

859
00:57:41,918 --> 00:57:43,192
It's him.

860
00:57:52,158 --> 00:57:53,352
What the fuck is that?

861
00:57:53,438 --> 00:57:55,906
<i>For most of the guys,</i>
<i>killings were accepted.</i>

862
00:57:55,998 --> 00:57:58,876
<i>Murder was the only way</i>
<i>everybody stayed in line.</i>

863
00:57:59,118 --> 00:58:02,155
<i>You got out of line, you got whacked.</i>
<i>Everybody knew the rules.</i>

864
00:58:02,238 --> 00:58:06,356
<i>Sometimes, even if people didn't</i>
<i>get out of line, they got whacked.</i>

865
00:58:06,878 --> 00:58:10,154
<i>Hits became a habit.</i>
<i>Guys would argue over nothing.</i>

866
00:58:10,558 --> 00:58:12,788
<i>Before you knew it, one was dead.</i>

867
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:14,994
<i>They were shooting each other all the time.</i>

868
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:18,548
<i>Shooting people was a normal thing.</i>
<i>It was no big deal.</i>

869
00:58:19,478 --> 00:58:22,151
<i>We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.</i>

870
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:25,913
<i>This was really a touchy thing.</i>
<i>Tommy killed a made guy.</i>

871
00:58:26,478 --> 00:58:30,027
<i>Batts was part of the Gambino crew</i>
<i>and considered untouchable.</i>

872
00:58:30,238 --> 00:58:33,753
<i>Before you touched a made guy,</i>
<i>you needed a good reason.</i>

873
00:58:34,158 --> 00:58:36,149
<i>You had to get an okay...</i>

874
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,594
<i>... or you'd get whacked.</i>

875
00:58:50,878 --> 00:58:53,267
<i>Saturday night was for wives, but...</i>

876
00:58:53,438 --> 00:58:56,350
<i>... Friday night at the Copa</i>
<i>was for the girlfriends.</i>

877
00:58:57,598 --> 00:59:01,830
We saw Sammy Davis, Jr. You got to see
this show. What a performer!

878
00:59:02,718 --> 00:59:06,028
He does impersonations.
It was like the real people!

879
00:59:06,958 --> 00:59:10,951
Unbelievable. You could see how
a white girl could fall for him.

880
00:59:11,038 --> 00:59:11,868
What?

881
00:59:12,558 --> 00:59:16,995
Not me. But you could see how some
girls could. Like that Swedish girl.

882
00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:18,836
So you condone that stuff.

883
00:59:19,278 --> 00:59:20,631
Take it easy.

884
00:59:20,918 --> 00:59:24,194
I don't want to be kissing
Nat King Cole over here.

885
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:25,797
I don't mean me.

886
00:59:27,278 --> 00:59:29,792
But, you know, he's got personality.

887
00:59:30,038 --> 00:59:31,187
"Personality?"

888
00:59:32,718 --> 00:59:35,312
He's talented.
I understand what you're saying.

889
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:38,794
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.

890
00:59:38,958 --> 00:59:41,108
I just said he was talented.

891
00:59:41,598 --> 00:59:43,554
Just leave it alone now.

892
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:46,548
He's talented. Leave it at that.

893
00:59:47,198 --> 00:59:49,712
<i>"Pretend you don't see her, my heart</i>

01:00:25,598 --> 01:00:27,077

01:00:29,278 --> 01:00:31,234
<i>"Look somewhere above her</i>

905
01:00:33,278 --> 01:00:35,348

907
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:42,186
<i>"At all"</i>

908
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:23,028
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?

909
01:01:38,718 --> 01:01:40,868
What did you hear about that thing?

910
01:01:41,558 --> 01:01:42,957
The Brooklyn thing?

911
01:01:43,038 --> 01:01:44,596
The guy from downtown.

912
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,188
The guy from where Christie lived?

913
01:01:49,118 --> 01:01:52,588
The guy who disappeared,
the one they made the beef on.

914
01:01:53,118 --> 01:01:54,597
Know the guy I mean?

915
01:01:55,038 --> 01:01:56,232
His name was Batts.

916
01:01:56,318 --> 01:01:59,276
His people are driving everyone crazy
looking for him.

917
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:01,110
Nobody knows what happened.

918
01:02:01,278 --> 01:02:05,032
He came into the joint that night
and then just disappeared.

919
01:02:06,558 --> 01:02:09,994
Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.

920
01:02:15,518 --> 01:02:17,429
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

921
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:24,550
I want my money.

922
01:02:25,118 --> 01:02:27,313
I want my money. He owes it.

923
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:38,398
You know that thing
we took care of upstate?

924
01:02:38,558 --> 01:02:41,356
- Paulie was talking about that.
- We must move it.

925
01:02:41,598 --> 01:02:44,749
They just sold the property
to make condominiums.

926
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:48,314
- It's been six months.
- We got to move it right away.

927
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:04,556
Henry, hurry up. My mother's making
fried peppers and sausage for us.

928
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:10,388
- Here's an arm.
- Very funny.

929
01:03:10,638 --> 01:03:11,832
Here's a leg.

930
01:03:11,998 --> 01:03:13,272
Here's a wing.

931
01:03:14,238 --> 01:03:18,550
What do you like, the leg or the wing?
Or you still go for the hearts and lungs?

932
01:03:19,678 --> 01:03:21,270
Oh, that's so bad.

933
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:29,590
What happened to the car?

934
01:03:30,078 --> 01:03:31,750
I hit a skunk, all right?

935
01:03:31,958 --> 01:03:33,437
Go with your mother.

936
01:03:34,718 --> 01:03:36,470
It's disgusting, Henry.

937
01:03:39,998 --> 01:03:43,035
<i>I set up Janice in an apartment</i>
<i>near The Suite.</i>

938
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:45,838
<i>That way I was able to stay over</i>
<i>a few nights a week.</i>

939
01:03:45,918 --> 01:03:46,953
My new antique lamp.

940
01:03:47,038 --> 01:03:50,075
<i>Karen was home with the kids.</i>
<i>She never asked questions.</i>

941
01:03:50,238 --> 01:03:52,149
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.

942
01:03:52,238 --> 01:03:53,671
Looks like Roma.

943
01:03:53,918 --> 01:03:56,478
This is all silk. This is from Siam.

944
01:03:57,998 --> 01:03:59,590
Come see my bedroom.

945
01:04:00,398 --> 01:04:04,232
- Tommy, will you take him?
- I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.

946
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:09,869
Love that crystal ball or what?

947
01:04:11,438 --> 01:04:14,077
This is where we spend most of our time.

948
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:18,193
I love the floral arrangements.

949
01:04:20,638 --> 01:04:21,354
French.

950
01:04:21,438 --> 01:04:25,192
<i>Janice and I were having so much fun,</i>
<i>she started screwing up at work.</i>

951
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,269
<i>I had to straighten out her boss.</i>

952
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:29,747
Janice can do what she wants to do!

953
01:04:30,078 --> 01:04:31,193
Got it?

954
01:04:31,478 --> 01:04:35,232
Just try to run. Hang up once more
and you'll deal with me!

955
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:42,471
Get off of her.

956
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:44,711
You're an animal.

957
01:04:57,278 --> 01:05:00,475
Spider, on your way here,
bring me a Cutty and water.

958
01:05:03,718 --> 01:05:06,027
- Did you guys eat?
- I'm starving.

959
01:05:06,878 --> 01:05:09,108
- I'll play these.
- You'll play those?

960
01:05:09,398 --> 01:05:11,354
Do I stutter? I play those.

961
01:05:14,878 --> 01:05:16,391
What am I? A mirage?

962
01:05:17,438 --> 01:05:19,429
Where's my fucking drink?

963
01:05:19,758 --> 01:05:22,226
- You wanted a drink?
- I asked you for one.

964
01:05:22,478 --> 01:05:25,072
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."

965
01:05:25,918 --> 01:05:27,988
Am I on a pay-no-mind list?

966
01:05:28,638 --> 01:05:31,357
No, I heard someone say "Spider, Spider."

967
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:35,114
- I thought it was Henry.
- You're a stuttering fuck.

968
01:05:35,678 --> 01:05:37,634
You said, "I'm all right, Spider."

969
01:05:37,718 --> 01:05:39,436
You ain't all right.

970
01:05:39,678 --> 01:05:41,748
No, you said you were all right.

971
01:05:41,918 --> 01:05:44,478
I am all right! You ain't, you prick.

972
01:05:45,598 --> 01:05:48,795
You been doing this all night to me,
motherfucker!

973
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:51,588
He wants a drink now? I'll bring it.

974
01:05:51,678 --> 01:05:54,397
Get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you prick!

975
01:05:54,558 --> 01:05:56,628
You walk like "Stepin Fetchit."

976
01:05:57,278 --> 01:05:58,870
For everybody else you run.

977
01:05:58,958 --> 01:06:01,950
Run for me!
Dance the fucking drink back here!

978
01:06:02,878 --> 01:06:04,391
What's that Bogart movie?

979
01:06:04,478 --> 01:06:07,197
- Where he played a cowboy.
- <i>The Oklahoma Kid</i>.

980
01:06:07,478 --> 01:06:10,470
<i>Oklahoma Kid. Shane</i>?
Oklahoma Kid, that's me.

981
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:13,189
You fucking varmint. Dance!

982
01:06:14,478 --> 01:06:15,672
Yahoo, motherfucker!

983
01:06:15,758 --> 01:06:17,988
Round up those fucking wagons.

984
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:25,717
Now he's moving.

985
01:06:27,638 --> 01:06:29,276
Shot in the foot.

986
01:06:29,438 --> 01:06:33,033
He's fine. So he got shot in the foot.
Big fucking deal.

987
01:06:33,438 --> 01:06:34,553
Get a towel.

988
01:06:34,718 --> 01:06:36,117
Nice fucking game.

989
01:06:37,438 --> 01:06:41,556
Take him to Ben Casey.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.

990
01:06:42,078 --> 01:06:44,387
Take him to the doctor down the street.

991
01:06:45,598 --> 01:06:47,236
Bones are all shattered.

992
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:48,950
Don't get me upset.

993
01:06:49,278 --> 01:06:52,156
Don't make a big fucking thing
out of it, Spider!

994
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:55,358
You trying to make me think
what I did here.

995
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,270
It was an accident.

996
01:06:57,598 --> 01:06:59,190
Little fucking actor.

997
01:06:59,838 --> 01:07:01,351
- You in?
- I'm in.

998
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:03,429
- Eight hundred.
- Eight hundred?

999
01:07:04,318 --> 01:07:07,833
You haven't been home in two weeks!
You're not going out tonight!

1000
01:07:08,078 --> 01:07:10,956
Will you grow up! I'm still going to go out!

1001
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:13,110
Not without your car keys.

1002
01:07:13,278 --> 01:07:15,428
Are you nuts? What's your problem?

1003
01:07:15,518 --> 01:07:17,349
Yes! Something's going on!

1004
01:07:17,598 --> 01:07:20,237
- Stop with that. Enough! Stop with that!
- No!

1005
01:07:20,558 --> 01:07:23,516
I look in your face and I know you're lying!

1006
01:07:26,238 --> 01:07:28,388
- Get out! Get out!
- Shut up!

1007
01:07:28,558 --> 01:07:29,752
Out of my life!

1008
01:07:29,998 --> 01:07:32,558
You're fucked in the head.
It's in your mind.

1009
01:07:32,718 --> 01:07:35,232
- You're a lousy bastard!
- You got a problem.

1010
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:38,989
Go to your ready-made whores.
That's all you're good for!

1011
01:07:39,198 --> 01:07:41,871
Get out of my life! I can't stand you!

1012
01:07:52,638 --> 01:07:54,310
Spider, what's your rush?

1013
01:07:57,518 --> 01:07:58,633
Thank you.

1014
01:07:58,878 --> 01:08:02,996
Spider, that bandage on your foot
is bigger than your fucking head.

1015
01:08:04,958 --> 01:08:08,268
Next thing you know he'll have
one of these fucking walkers.

1016
01:08:08,478 --> 01:08:10,230
But you can still dance.

1017
01:08:10,478 --> 01:08:14,596
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider.
You fucking bullshitter.

1018
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:17,474
Tell the truth. You want sympathy.

1019
01:08:17,598 --> 01:08:19,190
Go fuck yourself, Tommy.

1020
01:08:23,998 --> 01:08:25,431
I didn't hear right.

1021
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,270
I can't believe what I heard.

1022
01:08:27,358 --> 01:08:28,632
This is for you.

1023
01:08:29,758 --> 01:08:32,716
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of balls.

1024
01:08:32,958 --> 01:08:35,074
Good. Don't take shit from nobody.

1025
01:08:35,358 --> 01:08:38,748
He shoots him in the foot and
he tells him to go fuck himself.

1026
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:43,832
Tommy, you going to let this
fucking punk get away with that?

1027
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,909
What's this world coming to?

1028
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:52,626
That's what the fucking world's coming to.

1029
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:54,629
- How's that?
- What is wrong with you?

1030
01:08:54,718 --> 01:08:57,994
What is the fucking matter with you?
Are you stupid or what?

1031
01:08:58,558 --> 01:09:01,436
I was kidding with you.
Are you a sick maniac?

1032
01:09:01,678 --> 01:09:03,873
How do I know if you're kidding?

1033
01:09:04,318 --> 01:09:07,196
I'm kidding with you
and you fucking shoot the guy?

1034
01:09:07,278 --> 01:09:08,393
He's dead.

1035
01:09:09,918 --> 01:09:11,988
Good shot. I'm a good shot.

1036
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:15,913
- Hard to miss at this distance.
- You got a problem with what I did?

1037
01:09:16,558 --> 01:09:19,834
His family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.

1038
01:09:20,718 --> 01:09:22,868
Stupid bastard! I can't believe you.

1039
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:26,394
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.

1040
01:09:26,638 --> 01:09:30,392
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
Is it the first hole I dug?

1041
01:09:30,638 --> 01:09:33,072
Not the first hole I dug.
Where are the shovels?

1042
01:09:43,348 --> 01:09:45,908
It's Karen Hill. I want to talk to you.

1043
01:09:47,588 --> 01:09:49,579
Hello? Don't hang up on me!

1044
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:51,346
<i>I want to talk to you!</i>

1045
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:54,421
<i>You keep away from my husband,</i>
<i>you hear me?</i>

1046
01:09:56,628 --> 01:09:58,061
<i>Open the door!</i>

1047
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:01,022
Answer me!

1048
01:10:01,668 --> 01:10:04,228
I'll tell everyone who walks in here...

1049
01:10:04,388 --> 01:10:07,027
...that in 2R, Rossi,
you are nothing but a whore!

1050
01:10:07,108 --> 01:10:08,382
Superintendent?

1051
01:10:08,628 --> 01:10:11,096
I want you to know you have a whore...

1052
01:10:11,348 --> 01:10:12,622
<i>... living in 2R!</i>

1053
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,302
Rossi, Janice Rossi. Do you hear me?

1054
01:10:16,148 --> 01:10:18,946
<i>He's my husband!</i>
<i>Get your own goddamn man!</i>

1055
01:10:21,428 --> 01:10:22,781
Wake up, Henry.

1056
01:10:35,908 --> 01:10:37,341
What are you doing?

1057
01:10:39,988 --> 01:10:41,501
Karen, are you crazy?

1058
01:10:41,828 --> 01:10:43,022
I am crazy.

1059
01:10:43,988 --> 01:10:46,377
And I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.

1060
01:10:49,348 --> 01:10:51,020
Karen, take it easy.

1061
01:10:54,948 --> 01:10:56,540
Do you love her?

1062
01:10:57,748 --> 01:10:58,863
Do you?

1063
01:10:59,908 --> 01:11:01,102
Do you?

1064
01:11:04,068 --> 01:11:06,298
I love you. You know I love you.

1065
01:11:07,588 --> 01:11:08,703
You don't.

1066
01:11:10,708 --> 01:11:12,187
No, you don't.

1067
01:11:13,428 --> 01:11:15,419
Be careful, baby. Don't.

1068
01:11:16,228 --> 01:11:19,538
<i>But still I couldn't hurt him.</i>
<i>How could I hurt him?</i>

1069
01:11:20,148 --> 01:11:22,218
<i>I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.</i>

1070
01:11:22,308 --> 01:11:23,900
<i>The truth was...</i>

1071
01:11:24,148 --> 01:11:26,059
<i>... no matter how bad I felt...</i>

1072
01:11:26,788 --> 01:11:29,097
<i>... I was still very attracted to him.</i>

1073
01:11:30,308 --> 01:11:32,378
<i>Why give him to someone else?</i>

1074
01:11:32,628 --> 01:11:34,346
<i>Why should she win?</i>

1075
01:11:38,228 --> 01:11:41,379
Just put it down.
You know I love you, don't you?

1076
01:11:43,748 --> 01:11:45,500
You're all I want, Karen.

1077
01:11:47,028 --> 01:11:48,780
Please put the gun down.

1078
01:11:49,908 --> 01:11:51,387
Baby, come on.

1079
01:12:05,588 --> 01:12:07,499
What are you, fucking crazy?

1080
01:12:07,908 --> 01:12:11,537
I got enough to worry about
getting whacked on the street!

1081
01:12:11,908 --> 01:12:14,547
I got to fucking come home... for this?

1082
01:12:16,388 --> 01:12:18,106
I should fucking kill you!

1083
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:21,145
- How does it feel?
- I'm sorry.

1084
01:12:21,988 --> 01:12:23,580
How does it feel, Karen?

1085
01:12:40,548 --> 01:12:41,867
I'm sorry!

1086
01:12:48,548 --> 01:12:50,504
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?

1087
01:12:51,268 --> 01:12:54,146
- Looking good.
- Thank you. Good to see you.

1088
01:12:54,908 --> 01:12:57,502
- Hi, Paulie!
- Hi, honey. How are you?

1089
01:12:57,828 --> 01:12:59,978
- Go get some cigarettes, okay?
- Sure.

1090
01:13:01,268 --> 01:13:03,657
- Any of you need anything?
- I'm all right.

1091
01:13:03,828 --> 01:13:06,706
- You want anything to drink? A beer?
- No, this...

1092
01:13:06,868 --> 01:13:09,098
- Chinese food?
- No, come on, sit down.

1093
01:13:15,908 --> 01:13:17,546
Karen came to the house.

1094
01:13:18,308 --> 01:13:19,661
She's very upset.

1095
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:21,784
You got to straighten this out.

1096
01:13:21,908 --> 01:13:24,945
We got to have calm now.
We don't know what she'll do.

1097
01:13:25,188 --> 01:13:27,258
She's hysterical. Very excited.

1098
01:13:27,508 --> 01:13:31,183
She's wild. And you got to take it easy.
You got children.

1099
01:13:32,148 --> 01:13:35,584
I'm not saying to go back to her right now,
but you got to go back.

1100
01:13:35,668 --> 01:13:37,738
You got to keep up appearances.

1101
01:13:37,908 --> 01:13:40,547
The two of them come
to my house every day.

1102
01:13:40,788 --> 01:13:42,380
I can't have it.

1103
01:13:43,108 --> 01:13:45,702
I can't do it, Henry. I can't do it.

1104
01:13:46,548 --> 01:13:48,857
Nobody says you can't do what you want.

1105
01:13:49,108 --> 01:13:52,737
We all know that. This is what it is.
We know what it is.

1106
01:13:53,508 --> 01:13:56,864
You have to do the right thing.
You have to go home to the family.

1107
01:13:56,948 --> 01:13:59,337
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.

1108
01:13:59,828 --> 01:14:01,819
You got to go home. Smarten up.

1109
01:14:04,228 --> 01:14:05,661
I'll talk to Karen.

1110
01:14:05,828 --> 01:14:09,025
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.

1111
01:14:10,148 --> 01:14:14,221
I'll say you'll go back to her
and it'll be like when you first got married.

1112
01:14:14,468 --> 01:14:16,777
You'll romance her. It'll be beautiful.

1113
01:14:16,868 --> 01:14:18,586
I know how to talk to her.

1114
01:14:18,708 --> 01:14:22,462
Jimmy and Tommy were going to Tampa
this weekend to pick up something for me.

1115
01:14:22,548 --> 01:14:24,140
Instead, you'll go with Jimmy.

1116
01:14:24,228 --> 01:14:25,661
You come with me.

1117
01:14:25,748 --> 01:14:27,386
Have a good time.

1118
01:14:27,668 --> 01:14:30,057
Sit in the sun. Take a couple days off.

1119
01:14:30,308 --> 01:14:31,821
We'll have a good time.

1120
01:14:31,908 --> 01:14:34,422
When you come back,
you'll go back to Karen.

1121
01:14:35,348 --> 01:14:37,100
Please, there's no other way.

1122
01:14:37,188 --> 01:14:39,418
No divorce. We're not <i>animali</i>.

1123
01:14:39,828 --> 01:14:42,388
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.

1124
01:14:43,988 --> 01:14:46,218
She'll kill him, but not divorce him.

1125
01:14:51,268 --> 01:14:52,747
You going to pay us?

1126
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,261
Give us the fucking money!

1127
01:15:01,348 --> 01:15:02,303
I can't.

1128
01:15:05,428 --> 01:15:06,417
Let's go.

1129
01:15:14,788 --> 01:15:17,018
We'll throw the bastard to the lions.

1130
01:15:17,828 --> 01:15:20,137
Lions? I ain't going near any lions!

1131
01:15:20,388 --> 01:15:22,026
Throw him over the moat.

1132
01:15:22,148 --> 01:15:23,866
I'll get the money!

1133
01:15:24,388 --> 01:15:28,620
<i>They must really feed each other to the</i>
<i>lions, 'cause he gave the money right up.</i>

1134
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:30,061
I'll get the money.

1135
01:15:30,148 --> 01:15:32,708
<i>We spent the rest of the weekend</i>
<i>at the track.</i>

1136
01:15:33,348 --> 01:15:34,383
They mean business.

1137
01:15:34,468 --> 01:15:37,028
<i>Then, I couldn't believe what happened.</i>

1138
01:15:37,428 --> 01:15:39,988
<i>When we got home,</i>
<i>we were all over the newspaper.</i>

1139
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:42,946
<i>At first I didn't even know why</i>
<i>we got picked up.</i>

1140
01:15:43,188 --> 01:15:45,577
<i>Then I found out the guy we roughed up...</i>

1141
01:15:45,668 --> 01:15:48,546
<i>... had a sister working as a typist</i>
<i>for the FBI.</i>

1142
01:15:48,788 --> 01:15:51,427
<i>I couldn't believe it. Of all people.</i>

1143
01:15:51,668 --> 01:15:54,580
<i>She gave up everybody.</i>
<i>Jimmy, me. Even her brother.</i>

1144
01:15:56,148 --> 01:15:58,867
<i>It took the jury six hours</i>
<i>to bring us in guilty.</i>

1145
01:15:59,108 --> 01:16:01,906
<i>The judge gave us ten years,</i>
<i>like he was giving away candy.</i>

1146
01:16:01,988 --> 01:16:04,138
Ten years in a federal penitentiary.

1147
01:16:05,028 --> 01:16:06,939
You will now be turned over...

1148
01:16:07,028 --> 01:16:09,019
...to the U.S. Attorney General.

1149
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:16,465
Toast, guys. Good trip,
good life. Get out soon.

1150
01:16:17,508 --> 01:16:19,066
Good trip, sweetheart.

1151
01:16:21,988 --> 01:16:23,899
We'll watch the home front.

1152
01:16:25,268 --> 01:16:27,657
Say hello to those blow-job hacks.

1153
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:31,176
Motherfuck them every chance you get.

1154
01:16:37,108 --> 01:16:39,542
I'll call you when I get a chance.

1155
01:16:51,828 --> 01:16:52,943
Now take me to jail.

1156
01:16:57,268 --> 01:16:59,907
<i>In prison, dinner was always a big thing.</i>

1157
01:17:00,388 --> 01:17:03,698
<i>We had a pasta course,</i>
<i>then we had a meat or a fish.</i>

1158
01:17:03,988 --> 01:17:06,866
<i>Paulie did the prep work.</i>
<i>He was doing a year for contempt...</i>

1159
01:17:06,948 --> 01:17:09,382
<i>... and had a wonderful system for garlic.</i>

1160
01:17:09,748 --> 01:17:12,387
<i>He used a razor and sliced it so thin...</i>

1161
01:17:12,548 --> 01:17:15,426
<i>... it would liquefy in the pan</i>
<i>with a little oil.</i>

1162
01:17:15,668 --> 01:17:17,386
<i>It was a very good system.</i>

1163
01:17:17,748 --> 01:17:20,137
<i>Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.</i>

1164
01:17:20,468 --> 01:17:21,901
Get that smell?

1165
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:26,063
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:
Veal, beef, and pork.

1166
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:28,221
You got to have pork.

1167
01:17:29,028 --> 01:17:30,427
That's the flavor.

1168
01:17:30,548 --> 01:17:34,461
<i>I felt he used too many onions,</i>
<i>but it was still a very good sauce.</i>

1169
01:17:34,868 --> 01:17:36,938
Don't put too many onions in the sauce.

1170
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:39,417
I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.

1171
01:17:39,748 --> 01:17:43,821
- There are only three small onions.
- Three onions? How many tomatoes?

1172
01:17:44,068 --> 01:17:46,582
- Two big cans.
- You don't need three onions.

1173
01:17:47,108 --> 01:17:48,700
<i>Johnny Dio did the meat.</i>

1174
01:17:48,788 --> 01:17:51,507
<i>We had no broiler,</i>
<i>so he did everything in pans.</i>

1175
01:17:51,748 --> 01:17:54,785
<i>It smelled up the joint and</i>
<i>the hacks used to die...</i>

1176
01:17:55,028 --> 01:17:56,859
<i>... but he cooked a great steak.</i>

1177
01:17:56,948 --> 01:17:59,462
- How do you like yours?
- Medium rare.

1178
01:18:00,148 --> 01:18:02,298
Medium rare. An aristocrat.

1179
01:18:02,788 --> 01:18:06,144
<i>When you think of prison</i>
<i>you get pictures in your mind...</i>

1180
01:18:06,388 --> 01:18:09,903
<i>... of all those old movies with rows</i>
<i>and rows of guys behind bars.</i>

1181
01:18:09,988 --> 01:18:12,058
<i>It wasn't like that for wiseguys.</i>

1182
01:18:12,308 --> 01:18:15,983
<i>It wasn't bad, but I missed Jimmy,</i>
<i>who was doing his time in Atlanta.</i>

1183
01:18:16,068 --> 01:18:17,786
Give me two steaks.

1184
01:18:19,508 --> 01:18:24,138
<i>Everyone else in the joint was doing</i>
<i>real time, all together, living like pigs.</i>

1185
01:18:24,388 --> 01:18:27,027
<i>But we lived alone. We owned the joint.</i>

1186
01:18:27,268 --> 01:18:30,544
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.

1187
01:18:30,788 --> 01:18:31,903
They deserved it.

1188
01:18:31,988 --> 01:18:35,503
<i>Even the hacks we couldn't bribe</i>
<i>wouldn't rat on the guys we did.</i>

1189
01:18:35,588 --> 01:18:38,148
People used to be able
to leave their doors open.

1190
01:18:38,228 --> 01:18:41,823
Sorry it took so long.
That skinny guard's a pain in the ass.

1191
01:18:41,988 --> 01:18:45,219
- We have to take care of that bastard.
- I took care of him.

1192
01:18:45,348 --> 01:18:46,701
What'd you bring?

1193
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:48,463
Some bread.

1194
01:18:49,508 --> 01:18:51,260
I got peppers and onions.

1195
01:18:51,428 --> 01:18:53,737
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.

1196
01:18:53,948 --> 01:18:55,017
What else?

1197
01:18:55,348 --> 01:18:56,542
- Scotch.
- Nice.

1198
01:18:57,588 --> 01:18:58,907
- Red wine.
- Okay.

1199
01:18:59,828 --> 01:19:01,898
- Now we can eat.
- Some white, too.

1200
01:19:02,628 --> 01:19:06,303
Beautiful. Okay, boys, let's eat.
Come on, Johnny, Vinnie.

1201
01:19:08,068 --> 01:19:11,378
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.

1202
01:19:17,828 --> 01:19:19,261
Read 'em and weep.

1203
01:19:21,908 --> 01:19:23,341
What are you doing?

1204
01:19:32,628 --> 01:19:34,380
I'll catch you guys later.

1205
01:19:34,788 --> 01:19:36,665
Going for a walk in the park?

1206
01:19:39,028 --> 01:19:41,098
I'll catch you next week. Thanks.

1207
01:19:44,308 --> 01:19:47,459
- Is there any more?
- No, that's it. Have a good weekend.

1208
01:20:02,068 --> 01:20:03,786
You girls stay right here.

1209
01:20:04,228 --> 01:20:06,458
- Hold hands.
- Go right up front.

1210
01:20:23,428 --> 01:20:24,383
What?

1211
01:20:24,468 --> 01:20:26,538
I saw her name on the register.

1212
01:20:27,028 --> 01:20:28,586
Want her to visit you?

1213
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:31,984
Let her stay up all night crying
and writing to the parole board.

1214
01:20:32,068 --> 01:20:35,105
What am I doing here?
Where am I? I'm in jail.

1215
01:20:35,348 --> 01:20:37,498
I can't stop people from visiting me.

1216
01:20:37,588 --> 01:20:40,625
Let her sneak this stuff
in for you every week.

1217
01:20:41,948 --> 01:20:43,904
Let her fight these bastards every week!

1218
01:20:43,988 --> 01:20:46,058
Look what you're doing! Stop it!

1219
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:47,503
I'm sorry.

1220
01:20:48,148 --> 01:20:50,264
Let her sneak this shit in for you.

1221
01:20:52,148 --> 01:20:53,740
Will you stop it?

1222
01:20:53,988 --> 01:20:55,944
- Let her do it!
- Stop it!

1223
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:06,662
Nobody's helping me. I am all alone.

1224
01:21:08,308 --> 01:21:10,299
Belle and Morrie are broke.

1225
01:21:10,708 --> 01:21:13,745
I asked your friend Remo
for the money he owes you.

1226
01:21:14,228 --> 01:21:18,744
He told me to take the kids down
to the police station and get on welfare.

1227
01:21:19,028 --> 01:21:20,700
It's going to be okay.

1228
01:21:20,948 --> 01:21:24,702
I've never seen Paulie since he got out.
I never see anyone.

1229
01:21:25,428 --> 01:21:28,022
That's what happens when you go away.

1230
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:32,223
We're on our own. Forget everybody else.
Forget Paulie.

1231
01:21:32,788 --> 01:21:36,303
As long as he's on parole
he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

1232
01:21:39,388 --> 01:21:41,299
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.

1233
01:21:41,388 --> 01:21:43,822
All I need is for you to bring me this stuff.

1234
01:21:43,908 --> 01:21:46,706
A guy in here from Pittsburgh
will help me move it.

1235
01:21:46,788 --> 01:21:49,507
In a month we'll be fine.
We won't need anybody.

1236
01:21:49,668 --> 01:21:50,783
I'm afraid.

1237
01:21:50,868 --> 01:21:52,699
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out...

1238
01:21:52,788 --> 01:21:54,779
He is not helping us out.

1239
01:21:55,108 --> 01:21:57,258
Is he putting any food on the table?

1240
01:21:58,708 --> 01:22:00,539
We've got to help each other.

1241
01:22:00,788 --> 01:22:04,064
We got to be really,
really careful while we do it.

1242
01:22:08,308 --> 01:22:10,458
I don't want to hear about her anymore.

1243
01:22:10,548 --> 01:22:11,503
Never.

1244
01:22:38,948 --> 01:22:41,178
- We missed you.
- Are you here to stay?

1245
01:22:41,348 --> 01:22:44,784
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.

1246
01:22:44,868 --> 01:22:46,301
I did the sun.

1247
01:22:46,548 --> 01:22:49,745
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?

1248
01:22:50,948 --> 01:22:52,540
Do you like the house?

1249
01:22:53,988 --> 01:22:56,821
- Get packed. We're moving out.
- With what?

1250
01:22:57,268 --> 01:23:00,226
Don't worry.
Just start looking for a new house.

1251
01:23:00,468 --> 01:23:03,426
I got to go to Pittsburgh.
Those guys owe me $15,000.

1252
01:23:03,588 --> 01:23:05,738
We'll be okay. I got things lined up.

1253
01:23:05,828 --> 01:23:08,547
Pittsburgh? You have to see
your parole officer.

1254
01:23:08,628 --> 01:23:10,141
Don't worry about it.

1255
01:23:10,388 --> 01:23:13,664
Everything will be fine.
Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?

1256
01:23:23,988 --> 01:23:25,580
What do you want?

1257
01:23:25,908 --> 01:23:27,944
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.

1258
01:23:31,348 --> 01:23:34,306
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?

1259
01:23:36,068 --> 01:23:37,979
I don't want any more of that shit.

1260
01:23:38,068 --> 01:23:41,458
- What are you talking about?
- Just stay away from the garbage.

1261
01:23:41,988 --> 01:23:44,377
Inside, you did what you had to do.

1262
01:23:44,628 --> 01:23:47,381
I'm talking about now. From here and now.

1263
01:23:48,628 --> 01:23:51,096
- Why would I get into that?
- Don't make a jerk of me.

1264
01:23:51,188 --> 01:23:52,621
Just don't do it.

1265
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:54,543
Don't do it.

1266
01:23:56,388 --> 01:23:59,027
I want to talk about Jimmy.
Watch out for him.

1267
01:23:59,428 --> 01:24:02,226
He's a good earner,
but he takes too many chances.

1268
01:24:02,468 --> 01:24:04,538
I wouldn't take chances like Jimmy.

1269
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:08,223
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.
He's got too much to prove.

1270
01:24:08,548 --> 01:24:12,063
- You got to watch out for them.
- I only use them for certain things.

1271
01:24:12,148 --> 01:24:14,901
I ain't going to get fucked like Gribbs.

1272
01:24:15,428 --> 01:24:19,262
Gribbs is 70 years old and he'll
die in prison. I don't need that.

1273
01:24:19,908 --> 01:24:23,184
So I'm warning everybody.
Could be my son, could be anybody.

1274
01:24:24,148 --> 01:24:28,380
Gribbs got 20 years just for saying hello
to some fuck who was selling junk.

1275
01:24:28,788 --> 01:24:31,177
That won't happen to me, understand?

1276
01:24:31,428 --> 01:24:33,737
You're out early because I got you a job.

1277
01:24:33,828 --> 01:24:35,466
I don't need this heat.

1278
01:24:35,668 --> 01:24:38,057
You see anybody with shit you tell me.

1279
01:24:39,588 --> 01:24:40,543
Anybody.

1280
01:24:40,828 --> 01:24:42,181
- All right.
- Yeah?

1281
01:24:42,628 --> 01:24:43,947
Yeah. Of course.

1282
01:24:50,628 --> 01:24:54,064
<i>It took me a week of sneaking around</i>
<i>to unload the Pittsburgh stuff.</i>

1283
01:24:54,148 --> 01:24:56,582
<i>But when I did, it was a real score.</i>

1284
01:24:57,028 --> 01:24:59,462
<i>I used Sandy's place to mix the stuff.</i>

1285
01:24:59,748 --> 01:25:04,378
<i>Even with Sandy snorting more than she</i>
<i>mixed, I saw this was a good business.</i>

1286
01:25:04,748 --> 01:25:07,137
<i>I made $12,000 in my second week.</i>

1287
01:25:07,588 --> 01:25:10,739
<i>I had a down payment on my house</i>
<i>and things were rolling.</i>

1288
01:25:10,948 --> 01:25:14,179
<i>All I had to do was once in a while</i>
<i>tell Sandy I loved her.</i>

1289
01:25:18,468 --> 01:25:19,981
<i>It was perfect.</i>

1290
01:25:20,428 --> 01:25:24,421
<i>As long as I got the stuff from Pittsburgh,</i>
<i>Paulie would never find out.</i>

1291
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:28,337
<i>Within a couple of weeks</i>
<i>it got so big I needed some help.</i>

1292
01:25:28,868 --> 01:25:31,462
<i>I got Jimmy and Tommy</i>
<i>to come in with me.</i>

1293
01:25:31,748 --> 01:25:33,466
It's fucking great.

1294
01:25:40,228 --> 01:25:41,900
You bring your pay slips?

1295
01:25:45,188 --> 01:25:47,463
Four and a half months of dirt.

1296
01:25:47,908 --> 01:25:49,864
- It's so good.
- I did it.

1297
01:25:51,308 --> 01:25:53,538
- Do you love it?
- It's wonderful.

1298
01:25:54,308 --> 01:25:57,698
This we had to have made special.
Go ahead, sit in it.

1299
01:25:57,988 --> 01:26:00,422
The others you couldn't even sit in.

1300
01:26:00,708 --> 01:26:02,107
Okay, ready?

1301
01:26:02,468 --> 01:26:04,538
Watch the wall with the rock.

1302
01:26:11,268 --> 01:26:14,101
The electricians did it special. Come on.

1303
01:26:16,748 --> 01:26:21,026
This was imported. It came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?

1304
01:26:21,228 --> 01:26:24,345
- Nice, huh?
- Come here. Did you and Jimmy talk?

1305
01:26:24,708 --> 01:26:26,903
He's looking into everything.

1306
01:26:27,108 --> 01:26:29,861
It'll make the Air France hold
look like peanuts.

1307
01:26:30,188 --> 01:26:31,143
Come on.

1308
01:26:31,308 --> 01:26:33,344
- He'll do it, right?
- I told you.

1309
01:26:33,548 --> 01:26:37,018
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens. No promises.

1310
01:26:37,868 --> 01:26:40,826
Do you understand?
There's millions in there.

1311
01:26:41,188 --> 01:26:44,578
I've been cultivating this
son of a bitch for two years.

1312
01:26:44,868 --> 01:26:48,463
He owes me 20 grand. Once in a lifetime.
I could retire.

1313
01:26:48,708 --> 01:26:52,542
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit. My dream comes true.

1314
01:26:52,748 --> 01:26:54,101
Let's get a drink.

1315
01:26:54,228 --> 01:26:57,504
<i>These are the guys Jimmy put together</i>
<i>for what turned out to be...</i>

1316
01:26:57,588 --> 01:27:01,422
<i>... the biggest heist in American history.</i>
<i>The Lufthansa heist.</i>

1317
01:27:02,468 --> 01:27:06,780
<i>Tommy and Carbone would grab the guard</i>
<i>and make him get us in the front door.</i>

1318
01:27:08,748 --> 01:27:11,899
<i>Frenchy and Joe Buddha</i>
<i>had to round up the workers.</i>

1319
01:27:12,428 --> 01:27:16,421
<i>Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them</i>
<i>tied up and away from the alarms.</i>

1320
01:27:17,028 --> 01:27:19,098
<i>Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.</i>

1321
01:27:19,268 --> 01:27:22,783
<i>He used to play guitar at the lounge.</i>
<i>Everybody loved Stacks.</i>

1322
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:25,104
<i>He was supposed to steal the panel truck...</i>

1323
01:27:25,188 --> 01:27:28,339
<i>... and afterwards compact it</i>
<i>by a friend of ours in Jersey.</i>

1324
01:27:28,428 --> 01:27:30,737
<i>Only Morrie was driving us nuts.</i>

1325
01:27:31,148 --> 01:27:32,820
Have a drink and shut up.

1326
01:27:32,908 --> 01:27:34,705
<i>Just because he set this up...</i>

1327
01:27:34,788 --> 01:27:38,576
<i>... he bugged Jimmy for an advance</i>
<i>on the money we were going to steal.</i>

1328
01:27:38,668 --> 01:27:42,297
<i>He didn't mean anything by it.</i>
<i>That's just the way he was.</i>

1329
01:27:48,908 --> 01:27:52,901
<i>I had everyone working for me.</i>
<i>Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd.</i>

1330
01:27:55,588 --> 01:27:56,987
Have a good flight?

1331
01:27:57,068 --> 01:27:59,628
I hate Pittsburgh. They're such creeps.

1332
01:27:59,908 --> 01:28:01,705
They're not that bad.

1333
01:28:02,668 --> 01:28:04,545
And it's worth it, isn't it?

1334
01:28:04,868 --> 01:28:07,223
Is this the same baby you used last week?

1335
01:28:07,308 --> 01:28:10,300
No, that was my sister's. This is Deirdra's.

1336
01:28:11,308 --> 01:28:12,343
Big yawn.

1337
01:28:12,548 --> 01:28:14,140
She looks like you.

1338
01:28:14,308 --> 01:28:16,583
That's what the stewardess said.

1339
01:28:29,188 --> 01:28:30,621
Take it easy.

1340
01:28:31,108 --> 01:28:33,178
Give me a break. You got plenty.

1341
01:28:33,548 --> 01:28:37,018
You got all day. Let's make it last,
all right? Take it easy.

1342
01:28:37,388 --> 01:28:39,379
- I got to go.
- Where are you going?

1343
01:28:39,468 --> 01:28:43,620
Don't start. You know I got to go
do this thing. Where are my keys?

1344
01:28:44,708 --> 01:28:45,857
Over there.

1345
01:28:46,148 --> 01:28:49,777
It's a mess. It's like a pig pen.
Why do you think I got you a dishwasher?

1346
01:28:49,868 --> 01:28:51,267
Fucks up my nails.

1347
01:28:51,428 --> 01:28:53,180
You got to be smart.

1348
01:28:53,668 --> 01:28:56,546
There's enough powder here
to put us away forever.

1349
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:57,817
Loosen up.

1350
01:28:58,028 --> 01:28:59,620
What are you doing?

1351
01:29:01,828 --> 01:29:03,944
You don't have to go anywhere.

1352
01:29:04,388 --> 01:29:05,901
Make them wait.

1353
01:29:14,948 --> 01:29:18,418
<i>Nobody knows for sure how much</i>
<i>was taken in the pre-dawn raid...</i>

1354
01:29:18,508 --> 01:29:21,147
<i>... at the Lufthansa cargo terminal</i>
<i>at Kennedy Airport.</i>

1355
01:29:21,228 --> 01:29:24,618
<i>The FBI says $2,000,000,</i>
<i>Port Authority Police say $4,000,000.</i>

1356
01:29:29,988 --> 01:29:31,785
Those sons of bitches!

1357
01:29:32,068 --> 01:29:34,298
<i>... from the scene of the heist at JFK.</i>

1358
01:29:34,508 --> 01:29:38,183
<i>It looks like a big one. Maybe the biggest</i>
<i>this town has ever seen.</i>

1359
01:29:39,908 --> 01:29:41,864
Come here, you! Come here!

1360
01:29:42,828 --> 01:29:45,262
Look at this genius. This genius!

1361
01:29:49,708 --> 01:29:51,346
Merry Christmas, Jimmy!

1362
01:29:56,108 --> 01:29:58,303
- Who's this?
- This is my wife.

1363
01:29:59,908 --> 01:30:02,627
Come here. I want to show you something,
Jimmy.

1364
01:30:04,588 --> 01:30:09,059
Isn't she gorgeous? I bought it
for my wife. It's a coupe. I love that car.

1365
01:30:12,108 --> 01:30:14,827
What did I tell you?
I talked to you, didn't I?

1366
01:30:15,108 --> 01:30:18,942
Didn't I say not to go buy anything
for a while? The fucking car?

1367
01:30:19,148 --> 01:30:23,460
It's a wedding gift from my mother.
It's under her name. I just got married.

1368
01:30:23,748 --> 01:30:26,501
- I love that car.
- Excuse me for a second.

1369
01:30:26,788 --> 01:30:28,858
- I just got married.
- Are you nuts?

1370
01:30:29,068 --> 01:30:31,741
- Why are you getting excited?
- Are you stupid?

1371
01:30:31,908 --> 01:30:35,218
We got a million fucking bulls out there.
Everyone's watching us.

1372
01:30:35,308 --> 01:30:38,300
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.

1373
01:30:38,468 --> 01:30:41,346
I don't give a fuck.
Didn't you hear what I said?

1374
01:30:41,548 --> 01:30:45,382
Don't buy anything. Don't get anything.
What's the matter with you?

1375
01:30:46,468 --> 01:30:48,026
What are you getting excited for?

1376
01:30:48,108 --> 01:30:50,986
Because you're going to get us all pinched.

1377
01:30:51,428 --> 01:30:54,022
- What's the matter with you?
- I apologize.

1378
01:30:55,308 --> 01:30:57,663
- I'm sorry.
- What's the matter with you?

1379
01:31:04,428 --> 01:31:05,781
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1380
01:31:06,748 --> 01:31:08,306
It's under my mother's name.

1381
01:31:08,388 --> 01:31:10,822
What'd you say? You being a wise guy?

1382
01:31:11,148 --> 01:31:14,026
- I'm sorry. I apologize.
- What did I tell you?

1383
01:31:14,348 --> 01:31:17,420
What did I tell you?
You don't buy anything, you hear me?

1384
01:31:17,508 --> 01:31:19,100
You don't buy anything!

1385
01:31:19,268 --> 01:31:20,701
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1386
01:31:23,628 --> 01:31:25,698
The fat fuck ought to wear a sign.

1387
01:31:33,068 --> 01:31:35,343
I can't believe this. Are you stupid?

1388
01:31:35,428 --> 01:31:36,497
Excuse me.

1389
01:31:37,348 --> 01:31:39,020
- Take it off.
- Why?

1390
01:31:41,028 --> 01:31:42,427
Take it off!

1391
01:31:43,788 --> 01:31:47,303
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big
or attract attention?

1392
01:31:47,588 --> 01:31:50,625
One guy gets a Caddy
and one gets a $20,000 mink.

1393
01:31:50,828 --> 01:31:51,977
I'll return it.

1394
01:31:52,068 --> 01:31:56,698
Bring it back where you got it. Get it out
of here. Understand? Get it out of here!

1395
01:32:07,468 --> 01:32:10,187
This drink here is better than sex, babe.

1396
01:32:11,788 --> 01:32:15,940
I'm going to see Stacks.
Don't you look at anybody or I'll kill you.

1397
01:32:16,228 --> 01:32:20,062
He's so jealous. If I even look
at anyone else, he'll kill me.

1398
01:32:20,388 --> 01:32:21,662
That's great.

1399
01:32:21,988 --> 01:32:25,344
I tell them all not to attract attention.
What do they do?

1400
01:32:27,788 --> 01:32:30,256
I've been looking all over for you.

1401
01:32:30,948 --> 01:32:32,939
Listen, I need the money.

1402
01:32:33,508 --> 01:32:36,659
- Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas.
- I need the money.

1403
01:32:37,348 --> 01:32:39,339
I'm relaxing. I need the money.

1404
01:32:39,748 --> 01:32:42,342
- I did what I had to do.
- Not tonight, Morrie.

1405
01:32:42,468 --> 01:32:44,618
I did my caper. He owes me.

1406
01:32:45,028 --> 01:32:49,067
Everyone's flashing stuff. They got money.
I'm wearing the same shit.

1407
01:32:49,348 --> 01:32:52,181
They're wearing it. I got to talk to him.

1408
01:32:54,348 --> 01:32:56,543
I got 500 grand coming to me.

1409
01:32:57,508 --> 01:32:59,817
The biggest bundle he made in his life.

1410
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:02,183
I'll go talk to him. Go have a drink.

1411
01:33:02,308 --> 01:33:04,617
- I'll talk to him.
- It's poison in my eyes.

1412
01:33:04,708 --> 01:33:07,097
- Morris, are you all right?
- No, I'm not.

1413
01:33:13,508 --> 01:33:16,386
Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.

1414
01:33:19,428 --> 01:33:20,747
We did it!

1415
01:33:25,828 --> 01:33:27,466
- Who is it?
- It's me.

1416
01:33:27,748 --> 01:33:29,420
Pete? One second.

1417
01:33:30,188 --> 01:33:33,976
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did.
Don't be a moron with the money.

1418
01:33:35,428 --> 01:33:37,623
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!

1419
01:33:38,428 --> 01:33:41,022
I got the most expensive tree they had.

1420
01:33:42,588 --> 01:33:45,466
- What do you think, Mommy?
- I love them all.

1421
01:33:46,148 --> 01:33:47,786
I love the gold outfit.

1422
01:33:47,868 --> 01:33:49,699
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

1423
01:33:50,748 --> 01:33:52,067
And? And?

1424
01:33:52,828 --> 01:33:54,307
Happy Hanukkah.

1425
01:33:55,108 --> 01:33:58,066
- Very funny.
- Go get yourself something nice.

1426
01:34:06,148 --> 01:34:10,539
<i>Lufthansa should have been</i>
<i>our ultimate score. The heist of a lifetime.</i>

1427
01:34:11,068 --> 01:34:14,344
<i>Six million in cash.</i>
<i>More than enough to go around.</i>

1428
01:34:23,548 --> 01:34:24,901
Yo, Stacks!

1429
01:34:25,348 --> 01:34:26,576
Open up!

1430
01:34:33,948 --> 01:34:37,463
What's with you? He ain't ready.
I knew you wouldn't be ready.

1431
01:34:37,668 --> 01:34:40,740
- You didn't bring any coffee?
- Do I look like a caterer?

1432
01:34:40,828 --> 01:34:43,388
Frankie will make coffee. Make coffee.

1433
01:34:47,068 --> 01:34:48,945
Thought you'd have a bitch in here.

1434
01:34:49,028 --> 01:34:51,258
I did. Where the fuck is she?

1435
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:55,106
Always got these hot books around
or a bitch.

1436
01:34:55,428 --> 01:34:56,577
What time is it?

1437
01:34:56,668 --> 01:35:00,456
- It's 11:30. We were to be there by 9:00.
- I'll be ready in a minute.

1438
01:35:00,668 --> 01:35:04,138
You're always fucking late.
You'd be late for your own funeral.

1439
01:35:09,028 --> 01:35:12,703
What are you looking at?
Make that coffee to go. Let's go.

1440
01:35:15,868 --> 01:35:20,305
What the fuck you doing? It's a joke.
A joke. Put the fucking pot down.

1441
01:35:39,388 --> 01:35:41,344
<i>Stacks was always crazy.</i>

1442
01:35:41,828 --> 01:35:45,377
<i>Instead of getting rid of the truck</i>
<i>as he was supposed to, he got stoned...</i>

1443
01:35:45,468 --> 01:35:49,859
<i>... went to his girlfriend's, and by the time</i>
<i>he woke up, the cops had found the truck.</i>

1444
01:35:49,948 --> 01:35:51,904
<i>It was all over the television.</i>

1445
01:35:52,188 --> 01:35:54,941
<i>They even said they got</i>
<i>prints off the wheel.</i>

1446
01:35:55,748 --> 01:35:58,899
<i>It was just a matter of time</i>
<i>before they got to Stacks.</i>

1447
01:36:10,268 --> 01:36:11,906
I got to talk to you.

1448
01:36:12,348 --> 01:36:14,942
- Have a drink.
- Have a drink. Come on.

1449
01:36:15,228 --> 01:36:19,107
Have a drink. What are you doing?
It's an occasion. Have a drink.

1450
01:36:20,348 --> 01:36:22,179
I still have to talk to you.

1451
01:36:23,428 --> 01:36:26,067
- What happened with Stacks?
- Don't worry about that.

1452
01:36:26,148 --> 01:36:29,982
- There's feds all over the place.
- So what? Where are they going to go?

1453
01:36:30,268 --> 01:36:32,338
- It's in the papers.
- He's worried.

1454
01:36:33,308 --> 01:36:35,026
What are you worried about?

1455
01:36:35,108 --> 01:36:38,464
The television and the newspapers.
All the shit's out there.

1456
01:36:38,628 --> 01:36:41,779
- What are you worried about?
- You worry too much.

1457
01:36:42,148 --> 01:36:45,106
Everything is beautiful.
Didn't you tell him?

1458
01:36:45,468 --> 01:36:46,696
Not yet.

1459
01:36:47,268 --> 01:36:48,667
- What?
- Guess what?

1460
01:36:49,828 --> 01:36:51,580
They are going to make him.

1461
01:36:52,988 --> 01:36:55,058
Paulie's going to make you?

1462
01:36:56,668 --> 01:36:59,387
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.

1463
01:36:59,548 --> 01:37:02,108
Can you believe that? This Guinea bastard.

1464
01:37:03,068 --> 01:37:06,856
He's getting made. We'll work for
this guy one day. He'll be a boss.

1465
01:37:08,348 --> 01:37:09,827
I can't believe it.

1466
01:37:09,948 --> 01:37:12,178
I'm happy for you. Congratulations.

1467
01:37:12,348 --> 01:37:14,304
Motherfuckers, we got them now.

1468
01:37:14,748 --> 01:37:17,057
Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you.

1469
01:37:17,148 --> 01:37:18,900
Can I talk to you a second?

1470
01:37:19,068 --> 01:37:21,946
I masterminded the whole thing,
I'm left with dick.

1471
01:37:22,108 --> 01:37:25,498
They'd be up a creek if not for me.
Fuck him! I want my money.

1472
01:37:25,788 --> 01:37:29,667
I want my money! I've had it up to here!
That cheap cigarette hijacker.

1473
01:37:30,428 --> 01:37:33,465
- Fuck him! I want my money!
- Good. Go tell him.

1474
01:37:35,708 --> 01:37:37,824
Now will you keep you mouth shut?

1475
01:37:39,868 --> 01:37:43,941
Morrie, you'll get your money.
You just got to stop busting balls.

1476
01:37:44,508 --> 01:37:46,100
All right. You hear me?

1477
01:37:46,268 --> 01:37:48,498
Everything's going to be fine.

1478
01:37:57,508 --> 01:38:00,659
"Oh, Henry boy, the pipes,
the pipes are calling"

1479
01:38:01,988 --> 01:38:05,139
Half Mick, half Guinea?
I'll sing with an Italian accent.

1480
01:38:05,348 --> 01:38:08,784
"And down the glen,
the glen and down the mountainside

1481
01:38:17,788 --> 01:38:19,380
"The summer's gone

1482
01:38:19,708 --> 01:38:21,664
"And all the roses dying"

1483
01:38:45,628 --> 01:38:48,904
<i>I could see for the first time</i>
<i>that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.</i>

1484
01:38:48,988 --> 01:38:52,344
<i>His mind was going in eight</i>
<i>different directions at once.</i>

1485
01:38:54,308 --> 01:38:56,617
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

1486
01:38:57,028 --> 01:38:58,461
Morrie? Him?

1487
01:38:58,908 --> 01:39:01,706
<i>That's when I knew Jimmy</i>
<i>was going to whack Morrie.</i>

1488
01:39:01,788 --> 01:39:06,259
<i>That's how it happens. That's how fast</i>
<i>it takes for a guy to get whacked.</i>

1489
01:39:06,468 --> 01:39:08,777
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

1490
01:39:08,988 --> 01:39:12,424
He's always acting like a jerk.
Nobody listens to what he says.

1491
01:39:12,508 --> 01:39:15,386
Nobody cares what he says,
he talks so much.

1492
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:18,138
Make sure you bring him here tonight.

1493
01:39:18,468 --> 01:39:20,060
- Okay?
- All right.

1494
01:39:22,388 --> 01:39:25,186
Start like this. Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?

1495
01:39:25,348 --> 01:39:27,100
Stop breaking my balls.

1496
01:39:27,388 --> 01:39:29,504
<i>I was just stalling for time.</i>

1497
01:39:29,948 --> 01:39:33,861
<i>I knew I had 'til eight or nine o'clock</i>
<i>to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.</i>

1498
01:39:33,948 --> 01:39:38,100
<i>But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew,</i>
<i>I was going along with the program.</i>

1499
01:39:38,308 --> 01:39:41,459
I pulled out his hair. I bit him.
He's out cold.

1500
01:39:43,028 --> 01:39:45,940
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.

1501
01:39:46,148 --> 01:39:48,708
I walk away. We start to go in this joint.

1502
01:39:48,988 --> 01:39:52,378
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's doing this to me.

1503
01:39:52,868 --> 01:39:54,665
I don't want to fucking turn around.

1504
01:39:54,748 --> 01:39:58,900
I don't want to turn around. He picks up
his fucking head, he says, "Ah..."

1505
01:39:59,548 --> 01:40:01,345
I said, "Don't say it!"

1506
01:40:05,828 --> 01:40:06,943
"Jerkoff!"

1507
01:40:09,628 --> 01:40:12,700
What are you going to do? What?
I fucking fly at him!

1508
01:40:12,988 --> 01:40:16,264
I got him and I'm banging his head,
banging his fucking face.

1509
01:40:16,348 --> 01:40:20,864
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.
I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.

1510
01:40:21,148 --> 01:40:23,946
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.

1511
01:40:24,028 --> 01:40:26,303
Forget about tonight. Forget about it.

1512
01:40:27,428 --> 01:40:29,464
<i>It was a load off my mind.</i>

1513
01:40:30,468 --> 01:40:33,505
<i>He never knew how close he'd come</i>
<i>to getting killed.</i>

1514
01:40:33,668 --> 01:40:36,546
<i>Even if I told him he would</i>
<i>have never believed me.</i>

1515
01:40:38,588 --> 01:40:42,661
- Jimmy, could I talk to you now?
- You're a pisser. A real pisser.

1516
01:40:43,068 --> 01:40:45,457
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.

1517
01:40:45,668 --> 01:40:48,182
I've never met a ball buster like you.

1518
01:40:48,508 --> 01:40:50,703
Who loves you more than I do?

1519
01:40:51,228 --> 01:40:54,584
- I'd do anything for you.
- Except stop busting my balls.

1520
01:40:55,268 --> 01:40:57,702
- Let's go have coffee.
- Want to go to the diner?

1521
01:40:57,788 --> 01:40:59,938
We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.

1522
01:41:00,028 --> 01:41:03,498
- Which diner?
- Rockaway Boulevard. It's open 24 hours.

1523
01:41:03,588 --> 01:41:05,419
- They got danishes?
- They got everything.

1524
01:41:05,508 --> 01:41:08,068
Let's pick up some danishes for Belle.

1525
01:41:08,668 --> 01:41:12,866
Hear about the points we were shaving
up in Boston? It's terrific. Nunzio...

1526
01:41:20,508 --> 01:41:22,226
I thought he'd never shut up.

1527
01:41:22,308 --> 01:41:23,741
What a pain in the ass.

1528
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:26,706
- What'll we do with him?
- Chop him up and get rid of the car.

1529
01:41:26,788 --> 01:41:28,619
Call me when you're through.

1530
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:30,938
- Frank, let's chop him up.
- All right.

1531
01:41:31,388 --> 01:41:34,858
- Where you going, you dizzy motherfucker?
- You said chop him up.

1532
01:41:35,148 --> 01:41:37,059
At Charlie's, not here!

1533
01:41:39,228 --> 01:41:41,742
Come on, what are you doing?
Get out of here.

1534
01:41:41,828 --> 01:41:44,183
I got a better shot letting him drive.

1535
01:41:44,508 --> 01:41:45,736
The car's cold.

1536
01:41:45,828 --> 01:41:49,025
Get out of here! What, warm it up?
Get out of here!

1537
01:41:50,148 --> 01:41:52,537
- Who is it?
- It's Belle. Open up.

1538
01:41:52,828 --> 01:41:54,739
<i>It's Belle. Let me in.</i>

1539
01:41:55,108 --> 01:41:58,783
Morris didn't come home. He's missing.
I know something's happened.

1540
01:41:58,908 --> 01:42:00,182
Calm down.

1541
01:42:00,388 --> 01:42:02,948
He's missing! I know something happened.

1542
01:42:03,108 --> 01:42:05,258
He's probably drunk and fell asleep
somewhere.

1543
01:42:05,348 --> 01:42:08,818
In 27 years he's never been
away all night without calling.

1544
01:42:09,028 --> 01:42:11,383
Something's happened. I know you know.

1545
01:42:11,588 --> 01:42:14,739
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home then look for him.

1546
01:42:14,948 --> 01:42:17,508
I've been home! I've been on the phone...

1547
01:42:17,788 --> 01:42:19,221
He's playing cards.

1548
01:42:21,628 --> 01:42:24,347
- What'll I tell Belle?
- Who gives a fuck?

1549
01:42:25,028 --> 01:42:28,020
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care?

1550
01:42:28,548 --> 01:42:30,584
- Watch this.
- Don't fuck with them.

1551
01:42:30,788 --> 01:42:32,585
I'll bust their fucking balls.

1552
01:42:32,668 --> 01:42:35,228
Don't give them the satisfaction, the fucks.

1553
01:42:37,788 --> 01:42:40,063
Come on, fuckos. Let's go for a ride.

1554
01:42:41,348 --> 01:42:42,986
Keep them up all night.

1555
01:42:43,748 --> 01:42:45,181
I'll see you later.

1556
01:43:32,988 --> 01:43:36,185
<i>Jimmy was cutting every link</i>
<i>between himself and the robbery...</i>

1557
01:43:36,268 --> 01:43:38,418
<i>... but it had nothing to do with me.</i>

1558
01:43:48,668 --> 01:43:51,944
<i>I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me</i>
<i>some Christmas money.</i>

1559
01:43:53,468 --> 01:43:55,538
<i>From then on, I kept my mouth shut.</i>

1560
01:43:55,948 --> 01:43:58,781
<i>I knew Jimmy. He had the cash.</i>
<i>It was his.</i>

1561
01:43:59,788 --> 01:44:02,939
<i>He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie,</i>
<i>but that was it.</i>

1562
01:44:04,028 --> 01:44:07,384
<i>It made him sick to turn the money over</i>
<i>to the guys who stole it.</i>

1563
01:44:07,468 --> 01:44:10,187
<i>He'd rather whack them. What did I care?</i>

1564
01:44:10,468 --> 01:44:12,504
<i>I wasn't asking for anything.</i>

1565
01:44:12,748 --> 01:44:16,024
<i>And Jimmy was making nice money</i>
<i>through my Pittsburgh connections.</i>

1566
01:44:16,108 --> 01:44:20,181
<i>Still, months after the robbery</i>
<i>they were finding bodies all over.</i>

1567
01:44:41,388 --> 01:44:45,301
<i>When they found Carbone</i>
<i>in the meat truck, he was frozen so stiff...</i>

1568
01:44:45,508 --> 01:44:48,978
<i>... it took them two days</i>
<i>to thaw him out for the autopsy.</i>

1569
01:44:53,468 --> 01:44:55,698
<i>Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.</i>

1570
01:44:55,948 --> 01:44:59,224
<i>He was like a kid. We had money</i>
<i>coming in through Pittsburgh...</i>

1571
01:44:59,308 --> 01:45:02,903
<i>... and even after a while,</i>
<i>the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.</i>

1572
01:45:03,068 --> 01:45:05,138
<i>Jimmy was so happy that morning...</i>

1573
01:45:05,308 --> 01:45:08,186
<i>... because this was the day</i>
<i>Tommy was being made.</i>

1574
01:45:08,508 --> 01:45:11,784
<i>Jimmy was so excited,</i>
<i>you'd think he was being made.</i>

1575
01:45:12,028 --> 01:45:14,667
<i>He must have made four calls</i>
<i>to Tommy's house.</i>

1576
01:45:14,908 --> 01:45:18,742
<i>They had a signal set up so he'd know</i>
<i>the minute the ceremony was over.</i>

1577
01:45:19,388 --> 01:45:21,458
- Ma, where are you?
- Here I am.

1578
01:45:21,988 --> 01:45:24,377
- You're home.
- Home? I'm leaving.

1579
01:45:25,068 --> 01:45:27,138
- You look lovely.
- I look good, huh?

1580
01:45:27,388 --> 01:45:30,539
You look wonderful. Be careful.
Congratulations.

1581
01:45:31,468 --> 01:45:34,744
I love you. Don't paint
any more religious pictures, please.

1582
01:45:34,828 --> 01:45:35,943
God be with you.

1583
01:45:36,028 --> 01:45:38,667
<i>We always called each other goodfellas.</i>

1584
01:45:38,908 --> 01:45:40,500
<i>You'd say to somebody:</i>

1585
01:45:40,708 --> 01:45:44,747
<i>"You'll like this guy. He's all right.</i>
<i>He's a goodfella, one of us. "</i>

1586
01:45:45,028 --> 01:45:46,347
<i>You understand?</i>

1587
01:45:46,948 --> 01:45:49,064
<i>We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.</i>

1588
01:45:51,628 --> 01:45:54,825
<i>But Jimmy and I could never be made</i>
<i>because we had Irish blood.</i>

1589
01:45:54,908 --> 01:45:57,297
<i>It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.</i>

1590
01:45:57,508 --> 01:46:01,296
<i>To become a member of a crew</i>
<i>you must be 100 percent Italian...</i>

1591
01:46:01,548 --> 01:46:04,858
<i>... so they can trace your relatives</i>
<i>back to the old country.</i>

1592
01:46:10,948 --> 01:46:13,542
<i>It's the highest honor they can give you.</i>

1593
01:46:13,788 --> 01:46:16,222
<i>It means you belong to</i>
<i>a family and a crew.</i>

1594
01:46:16,508 --> 01:46:19,227
<i>It means nobody can fuck around with you.</i>

1595
01:46:19,548 --> 01:46:24,178
<i>Also, you can fuck around with anybody,</i>
<i>as long as they aren't also a member.</i>

1596
01:46:24,508 --> 01:46:27,944
<i>It's like a license to steal.</i>
<i>A license to do anything.</i>

1597
01:46:29,708 --> 01:46:31,221
How many years since you were made?

1598
01:46:31,308 --> 01:46:33,776
I'm an old-timer. Thirty years ago.

1599
01:46:34,468 --> 01:46:38,859
Brings back a lot of memories.
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?

1600
01:46:41,948 --> 01:46:44,906
<i>As far as Jimmy was concerned,</i>
<i>with Tommy being made...</i>

1601
01:46:44,988 --> 01:46:47,263
<i>... it was like we were all being made.</i>

1602
01:46:48,028 --> 01:46:50,667
<i>We would now have</i>
<i>one of our own as a member.</i>

1603
01:47:06,028 --> 01:47:07,825
- Who's this?
- <i>This is Vinnie.</i>

1604
01:47:07,908 --> 01:47:10,263
What happened?
Did we get straightened out?

1605
01:47:10,348 --> 01:47:13,704
<i>We had a problem.</i>
<i>We tried to do everything we could.</i>

1606
01:47:14,508 --> 01:47:18,421
<i>You know what I mean. He's gone,</i>
<i>and we couldn't do nothing about it.</i>

1607
01:47:20,748 --> 01:47:22,101
What do you mean?

1608
01:47:22,268 --> 01:47:23,906
<i>He's gone. He's gone.</i>

1609
01:47:25,348 --> 01:47:26,417
<i>That's it.</i>

1610
01:47:31,108 --> 01:47:32,257
I knew it!

1611
01:47:32,908 --> 01:47:34,819
I can't fucking believe it.

1612
01:47:44,348 --> 01:47:46,339
- They fucking whacked him.
- Fuck.

1613
01:48:02,308 --> 01:48:03,707
Are you all right?

1614
01:48:10,748 --> 01:48:14,377
<i>It was revenge for Billy Batts,</i>
<i>and a lot of other things.</i>

1615
01:48:15,228 --> 01:48:16,104
That's that.

1616
01:48:16,188 --> 01:48:18,497
<i>There was nothing we could do about it.</i>

1617
01:48:18,988 --> 01:48:23,300
<i>Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't.</i>
<i>We had to sit still and take it.</i>

1618
01:48:23,908 --> 01:48:27,059
<i>It was among the Italians.</i>
<i>It was real greaseball shit.</i>

1619
01:48:39,388 --> 01:48:41,458
<i>They even shot Tommy in the face...</i>

1620
01:48:41,668 --> 01:48:45,183
<i>... so his mother couldn't give him</i>
<i>an open-coffin at the funeral.</i>

1621
01:49:30,148 --> 01:49:33,140
<i>I had a busy day.</i>
<i>I had to drop the guns off at Jimmy's...</i>

1622
01:49:33,228 --> 01:49:35,219
<i>... to match some silencers he had.</i>

1623
01:49:35,308 --> 01:49:38,266
<i>I had to pick up my brother</i>
<i>at the hospital...</i>

1624
01:49:38,508 --> 01:49:40,738
<i>... and pick up some stuff for Lois...</i>

1625
01:49:40,908 --> 01:49:43,820
<i>... to fly down to some customers I had</i>
<i>near Atlanta.</i>

1626
01:49:54,828 --> 01:49:58,264
<i>Right away I knew he didn't want them</i>
<i>and I'd be stuck for the money.</i>

1627
01:49:58,348 --> 01:50:02,307
<i>I bought them because he wanted them</i>
<i>and now he didn't want them.</i>

1628
01:50:02,588 --> 01:50:05,148
What good are these? None of them fit.

1629
01:50:05,388 --> 01:50:07,299
I'm not paying for these!

1630
01:50:07,588 --> 01:50:11,217
<i>I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was</i>
<i>so pissed off, he didn't even say good-bye.</i>

1631
01:50:11,308 --> 01:50:13,697
The drugs are making your mind
into mush!

1632
01:50:13,828 --> 01:50:15,261
I'll take 'em back.

1633
01:50:27,868 --> 01:50:29,938
<i>My Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.</i>

1634
01:50:30,028 --> 01:50:33,225
<i>Since I would see them in the afternoon,</i>
<i>for a delivery...</i>

1635
01:50:33,628 --> 01:50:36,142
<i>... I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.</i>

1636
01:50:54,148 --> 01:50:55,263
Oh, my God.

1637
01:50:56,548 --> 01:51:00,177
<i>At the hospital,</i>
<i>Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.</i>

1638
01:51:01,148 --> 01:51:02,661
What happened to you?

1639
01:51:03,148 --> 01:51:06,026
I almost got into an accident
on the way here.

1640
01:51:06,148 --> 01:51:08,901
<i>And I told him I was partying all night.</i>

1641
01:51:09,388 --> 01:51:10,377
I'm fine.

1642
01:51:10,468 --> 01:51:11,947
Get over here.

1643
01:51:12,188 --> 01:51:13,985
Let me check you out.

1644
01:51:17,788 --> 01:51:20,018
<i>He took mercy on me, gave me Valium...</i>

1645
01:51:20,268 --> 01:51:22,020
<i>... and sent me home.</i>

1646
01:51:22,268 --> 01:51:26,102
<i>My plan was to drop off my brother</i>
<i>at the house and pick up Karen.</i>

1647
01:51:27,708 --> 01:51:30,859
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?

1648
01:51:31,548 --> 01:51:34,506
Right up there.
I think it's been following me all morning.

1649
01:51:34,588 --> 01:51:37,386
- Get the fuck out. Are you nuts?
- I'm telling you.

1650
01:51:37,468 --> 01:51:40,665
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.

1651
01:51:40,988 --> 01:51:43,786
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.

1652
01:51:43,908 --> 01:51:46,866
I've been all over town
and I've seen it all day.

1653
01:51:53,188 --> 01:51:55,019
<i>I was cooking dinner that night.</i>

1654
01:51:55,108 --> 01:51:59,386
<i>I had to start braising the beef</i>
<i>and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.</i>

1655
01:52:01,948 --> 01:52:05,065
<i>It was Michael's favorite.</i>
<i>I was making ziti with gravy...</i>

1656
01:52:05,148 --> 01:52:06,900
<i>... roasted peppers...</i>

1657
01:52:07,108 --> 01:52:10,623
<i>... string beans with olive oil.</i>
<i>I had some beautiful cutlets...</i>

1658
01:52:11,428 --> 01:52:12,907
<i>... that were cut just right...</i>

1659
01:52:12,988 --> 01:52:15,866
<i>... that I was going to fry up</i>
<i>as an appetizer.</i>

1660
01:52:15,948 --> 01:52:17,939
<i>So I was home for about an hour.</i>

1661
01:52:18,028 --> 01:52:22,260
<i>My plan was to start dinner early so I</i>
<i>could unload the guns Jimmy didn't want.</i>

1662
01:52:22,468 --> 01:52:26,541
<i>Then get the package for Lois</i>
<i>to take to Atlanta later that night.</i>

1663
01:52:27,628 --> 01:52:31,257
<i>I kept looking out the window</i>
<i>and saw that the helicopter was gone.</i>

1664
01:52:31,548 --> 01:52:33,300
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.

1665
01:52:33,388 --> 01:52:35,777
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.

1666
01:52:36,028 --> 01:52:40,146
<i>I asked my brother to watch the sauce,</i>
<i>and Karen and I started out.</i>

1667
01:52:42,268 --> 01:52:43,986
Oh, God. I see it.

1668
01:52:44,828 --> 01:52:46,739
- Look, it's right there.
- Damn!

1669
01:52:48,348 --> 01:52:49,417
That's it.

1670
01:52:49,548 --> 01:52:51,618
We got to get to your mother's.

1671
01:52:51,948 --> 01:52:53,097
See, I told you.

1672
01:52:53,188 --> 01:52:54,541
It's funny.

1673
01:52:55,068 --> 01:52:58,458
- It's not the end of the world.
- We're going to your mother's.

1674
01:53:25,308 --> 01:53:28,823
Tell your mother not to touch anything
outside of the house. Nothing.

1675
01:53:28,908 --> 01:53:31,706
Why didn't you go to your mother's house?

1676
01:53:32,748 --> 01:53:35,740
<i>"Everything's gonna be all right</i>
<i>this morning"</i>

1677
01:53:36,748 --> 01:53:38,147
Let's go shopping.

1678
01:53:41,188 --> 01:53:44,624
No, I'm not nuts,
it's been following me all fucking morning!

1679
01:53:47,908 --> 01:53:49,864
Alright. He thinks I'm paranoid!

1680
01:53:49,948 --> 01:53:53,861
I should bring him the helicopter,
then we'll see how paranoid I am.

1681
01:53:54,988 --> 01:53:56,899
Come on, let's go inside.

1682
01:54:00,748 --> 01:54:02,022
Yeah, it's gone.

1683
01:54:02,268 --> 01:54:05,340
- I don't hear anything.
- Let's go back to your mother's.

1684
01:54:17,948 --> 01:54:19,859
- They all right?
- They're great.

1685
01:54:20,068 --> 01:54:23,265
Didn't I say you were paranoid?
Didn't I tell him?

1686
01:54:23,628 --> 01:54:25,220
Yeah. I need a hit.

1687
01:54:25,548 --> 01:54:28,585
Want to see helicopters?
Come on, I'll show you helicopters.

1688
01:54:28,668 --> 01:54:31,580
I've seen enough helicopters for one day,
thank you.

1689
01:54:32,348 --> 01:54:36,500
<i>I had to get home and get the package</i>
<i>ready for Lois to take on her trip.</i>

1690
01:54:36,748 --> 01:54:40,582
<i>Also, I had to get to Sandy's to give</i>
<i>the package a whack with quinine.</i>

1691
01:54:40,708 --> 01:54:43,017
<i>Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass.</i>

1692
01:54:43,108 --> 01:54:46,578
<i>I had the cooking to finish,</i>
<i>and I had to get Lois ready for her trip.</i>

1693
01:54:46,668 --> 01:54:50,058
- It's Sandy. What the fuck is this?
- She's a pain in the ass.

1694
01:54:50,588 --> 01:54:52,624
- <i>When are you coming over?</i>
- In an hour.

1695
01:54:52,708 --> 01:54:55,859
- <i>You staying tonight, right?</i>
- I can't. I got my brother tonight.

1696
01:54:55,948 --> 01:54:59,941
Come on, stop. Stop.
We'll talk about it later, okay? Good-bye.

1697
01:55:07,188 --> 01:55:09,019
- Hello?
- <i>It's me. You ready?</i>

1698
01:55:10,108 --> 01:55:12,497
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.

1699
01:55:13,228 --> 01:55:16,504
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
- I'm stirring it.

1700
01:55:16,708 --> 01:55:18,983
- <i>Listen, you know what to do?</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

1701
01:55:19,068 --> 01:55:21,377
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, Lois!
This is important.

1702
01:55:21,468 --> 01:55:24,107
Make sure you leave the house
when you make the call.

1703
01:55:24,188 --> 01:55:26,986
Understand me? Call from an outside line.
I mean it!

1704
01:55:27,068 --> 01:55:30,265
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb.
I know what to do.

1705
01:55:30,908 --> 01:55:33,217
You little hick, just make sure you do it!

1706
01:55:33,308 --> 01:55:34,377
<i>You're a pain.</i>

1707
01:55:34,468 --> 01:55:36,424
- <i>Hey! Just do it!</i>
- Okay.

1708
01:55:38,988 --> 01:55:43,106
Un-fucking-believable. All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.

1709
01:55:44,548 --> 01:55:46,504
- What'd he say?
- Nothing.

1710
01:55:46,908 --> 01:55:49,058
<i>What does she do after she hangs up?</i>

1711
01:55:49,148 --> 01:55:52,823
<i>After everything I told her?</i>
<i>After all her "yeah, yeah" bullshit?</i>

1712
01:55:53,068 --> 01:55:57,584
<i>She calls from the house. If anyone</i>
<i>was listening they'd know everything.</i>

1713
01:55:57,868 --> 01:56:02,498
<i>They'd know a package was leaving my</i>
<i>house and they'd have the flight number.</i>

1714
01:56:03,468 --> 01:56:06,266
<i>As soon as I got home, I started cooking.</i>

1715
01:56:06,428 --> 01:56:08,658
<i>I had a few hours until Lois' flight.</i>

1716
01:56:08,908 --> 01:56:10,978
<i>I told my brother to watch on the stove.</i>

1717
01:56:11,068 --> 01:56:14,902
<i>All day long the poor guy's been</i>
<i>watching helicopters and tomato sauce.</i>

1718
01:56:15,468 --> 01:56:19,780
<i>I had to drive over to Sandy's,</i>
<i>mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.</i>

1719
01:56:30,628 --> 01:56:33,540
Do you think you can come over,
fuck me, then leave?

1720
01:56:34,468 --> 01:56:38,256
- Got someplace better to go?
- Don't talk like that. Come on.

1721
01:56:38,588 --> 01:56:40,340
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1722
01:56:40,588 --> 01:56:41,816
You believe me?

1723
01:56:43,228 --> 01:56:44,900
Do you believe me?

1724
01:56:47,708 --> 01:56:49,460
- That's the last one?
- Yeah.

1725
01:56:58,268 --> 01:57:00,543
You lying son of a bitch! I hate you!

1726
01:57:07,308 --> 01:57:10,106
Please stop feeding the dog
from the table...

1727
01:57:10,348 --> 01:57:13,146
...from the plate on top of it. Stop it.

1728
01:57:13,628 --> 01:57:15,858
- I have to.
- You don't have to.

1729
01:57:20,428 --> 01:57:21,781
I got to go home.

1730
01:57:23,788 --> 01:57:25,619
What do you mean you got to go home?

1731
01:57:25,708 --> 01:57:29,303
We got to tape this stuff to your leg.
We got to go soon.

1732
01:57:29,908 --> 01:57:31,978
I got to go home and get my hat.

1733
01:57:32,508 --> 01:57:35,068
Forget your fucking hat!
Are you kidding me?

1734
01:57:35,308 --> 01:57:38,266
I need a trip to Rockaway
because you want your hat?

1735
01:57:38,348 --> 01:57:41,704
I got to have it. It's my lucky hat.
I never fly without it.

1736
01:57:43,588 --> 01:57:46,102
Do you understand
what we are involved in?

1737
01:57:46,348 --> 01:57:49,465
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.

1738
01:57:54,148 --> 01:57:57,857
<i>What could I do if she insisted</i>
<i>I drive her home for her damn hat?</i>

1739
01:57:58,108 --> 01:58:00,668
<i>I hid the package and</i>
<i>went to take her home.</i>

1740
01:58:00,748 --> 01:58:01,658
A hat?

1741
01:58:10,348 --> 01:58:11,827
What the fuck is this?

1742
01:58:11,908 --> 01:58:14,422
Police! Freeze! Don't move, motherfucker!

1743
01:58:14,588 --> 01:58:17,466
I'll blow your brains out!
Shut the car off slowly!

1744
01:58:21,228 --> 01:58:25,699
<i>I thought I was dead, but when I</i>
<i>heard all the noise I knew they were cops.</i>

1745
01:58:25,948 --> 01:58:27,540
<i>Only cops talk that way.</i>

1746
01:58:27,748 --> 01:58:29,101
Don't fucking move.

1747
01:58:29,188 --> 01:58:32,783
<i>If they had been wiseguys,</i>
<i>I wouldn't have heard a thing.</i>

1748
01:58:33,148 --> 01:58:34,740
<i>I would have been dead.</i>

1749
01:58:35,628 --> 01:58:37,539
Michael! Lock the door!

1750
01:59:00,348 --> 01:59:04,899
Talk to me. When was the last time
you took a collar? I'm talking to you.

1751
01:59:05,228 --> 01:59:08,823
You don't want to say a fucking word,
don't. I don't give a fuck.

1752
01:59:08,908 --> 01:59:12,742
You'll do 25 years. See how much
of a good guy you'll be then.

1753
01:59:12,988 --> 01:59:15,786
<i>All day I thought the guys</i>
<i>in the helicopter...</i>

1754
01:59:15,948 --> 01:59:19,702
<i>... were local cops busting my balls over</i>
<i>Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.</i>

1755
01:59:19,788 --> 01:59:21,062
Just get the lawyer.

1756
01:59:21,148 --> 01:59:24,265
<i>They'd been on me a month.</i>
<i>Phone taps, surveillance, everything.</i>

1757
01:59:24,348 --> 01:59:27,021
You know the boys. All the pals are here.

1758
01:59:27,108 --> 01:59:30,578
You don't want to talk to me,
you'll have a fucking problem all night.

1759
01:59:30,668 --> 01:59:34,422
Each one of these counts holds
25-to-life in New York State.

1760
01:59:34,788 --> 01:59:38,622
25 fucking years, pal.
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.

1761
01:59:39,948 --> 01:59:42,257
What, were you guys grocery shopping?

1762
01:59:43,228 --> 01:59:46,777
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?

1763
01:59:47,068 --> 01:59:49,184
You got anything good in there?

1764
01:59:50,748 --> 01:59:52,101
Is it good?

1765
01:59:56,748 --> 01:59:58,420
Bye-bye, dickhead.

1766
02:00:01,228 --> 02:00:02,820
See you in Attica, dick.

1767
02:00:03,308 --> 02:00:06,584
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.

1768
02:00:06,988 --> 02:00:10,105
He wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.

1769
02:00:10,188 --> 02:00:11,780
Fuck Jimmy and his money!

1770
02:00:11,868 --> 02:00:15,304
I got to straighten out everything
with Paulie or I'm dead.

1771
02:00:15,628 --> 02:00:17,619
Then you're better off staying in here.

1772
02:00:17,708 --> 02:00:22,338
They could whack me in here as easy as
outside. They're afraid I'll rat them out.

1773
02:00:22,588 --> 02:00:26,945
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here. You got to get me out.

1774
02:00:27,108 --> 02:00:31,147
<i>Karen finally got her mother to put</i>
<i>her house up for my bail and I was out.</i>

1775
02:00:31,308 --> 02:00:35,460
<i>I remember I had this feeling I would be</i>
<i>killed right outside the jail.</i>

1776
02:00:35,748 --> 02:00:39,024
<i>I knew Paulie was still pissed at me</i>
<i>and he's such a hothead.</i>

1777
02:00:39,108 --> 02:00:40,826
<i>And I was worried about Jimmy.</i>

1778
02:00:40,908 --> 02:00:45,220
<i>See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out</i>
<i>he was in the drug deals with me...</i>

1779
02:00:45,628 --> 02:00:48,825
<i>... Paulie would have Jimmy whacked</i>
<i>even before me.</i>

1780
02:00:50,028 --> 02:00:51,825
<i>This is the bad time.</i>

1781
02:00:52,748 --> 02:00:55,262
<i>I didn't feel safe until I got home.</i>

1782
02:00:56,508 --> 02:01:00,217
<i>Now my plan was to stay alive</i>
<i>long enough to sell off the dope...</i>

1783
02:01:00,428 --> 02:01:04,740
<i>... the cops never found, then disappear</i>
<i>until things got straightened out.</i>

1784
02:01:06,508 --> 02:01:09,068
Fuck! Where's the stuff I left, Karen?

1785
02:01:09,348 --> 02:01:11,225
I flushed it down the toilet.

1786
02:01:12,428 --> 02:01:13,338
What?

1787
02:01:14,348 --> 02:01:16,384
What was I supposed to do?

1788
02:01:16,908 --> 02:01:20,537
That was worth $60,000!
I need that money! That's all we got!

1789
02:01:21,028 --> 02:01:23,064
They had a search warrant!

1790
02:01:23,748 --> 02:01:28,060
That's all the money we had! I was
depending on that! Why did you do that?

1791
02:01:28,268 --> 02:01:30,828
I had to! They were going to find it!

1792
02:01:31,068 --> 02:01:34,663
- They wouldn't have found it!
- They would have! I swear!

1793
02:01:35,748 --> 02:01:37,659
They would've found it!

1794
02:01:39,388 --> 02:01:40,867
Why did you do that?

1795
02:01:41,308 --> 02:01:44,425
- They would have found it.
- Why did you do that?

1796
02:01:45,828 --> 02:01:47,181
Oh, my God!

1797
02:01:47,788 --> 02:01:49,938
- I had to do it.
- Oh, my God!

1798
02:02:25,188 --> 02:02:27,179
<i>Paulie, I'm really sorry.</i>

1799
02:02:29,628 --> 02:02:32,665
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.

1800
02:02:32,908 --> 02:02:34,341
Yeah, you fucked up.

1801
02:02:37,708 --> 02:02:39,539
But I'm all right now.

1802
02:02:41,148 --> 02:02:44,663
I can be trusted now. I'm clean.
On my kids, I'm clean.

1803
02:02:45,348 --> 02:02:47,782
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.

1804
02:02:48,708 --> 02:02:52,587
You treated me like a fucking jerk.
Like I was never nothing to you.

1805
02:02:52,828 --> 02:02:55,547
After what you said,
I couldn't come to you.

1806
02:02:56,748 --> 02:02:58,704
You know, I was ashamed.

1807
02:03:01,868 --> 02:03:03,460
I'm ashamed now.

1808
02:03:06,988 --> 02:03:09,183
But I got nowhere else to go.

1809
02:03:12,268 --> 02:03:16,500
You're all I got. And I really,
really need your help. I really do.

1810
02:03:22,188 --> 02:03:23,257
Take this.

1811
02:03:37,708 --> 02:03:40,097
And now I've got to turn my back on you.

1812
02:03:49,788 --> 02:03:51,460
<i>Thirty-two hundred bucks.</i>

1813
02:03:51,868 --> 02:03:54,860
<i>That's what he gave me.</i>
<i>$3,200 for a lifetime.</i>

1814
02:03:56,428 --> 02:03:58,988
<i>It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.</i>

1815
02:03:59,068 --> 02:04:01,377
- <i>We got to get out.</i>
- <i>I don't want to run.</i>

1816
02:04:01,468 --> 02:04:05,097
Am I supposed to pick up
and leave everything? Go hiding?

1817
02:04:05,628 --> 02:04:07,584
I don't want to do that.

1818
02:04:08,028 --> 02:04:11,782
If we stay around here we're dead.
You got it? We' re dead.

1819
02:04:13,468 --> 02:04:17,984
They're right. You took too much
of that stuff. You're totally paranoid.

1820
02:04:21,228 --> 02:04:22,741
How's he doing?

1821
02:04:23,268 --> 02:04:24,496
He's okay.

1822
02:04:25,068 --> 02:04:26,660
They sobered him up.

1823
02:04:26,908 --> 02:04:28,819
Good. Glad to hear it.

1824
02:04:32,908 --> 02:04:36,025
- What kind of questions they been asking?
- I don't know.

1825
02:04:37,668 --> 02:04:41,104
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money.

1826
02:04:41,628 --> 02:04:44,301
The girls are old enough
to read the newspapers.

1827
02:04:44,388 --> 02:04:46,265
Tell him he's got to call me.

1828
02:04:46,988 --> 02:04:50,617
As soon as you talk to him,
he's got to call me. It's important.

1829
02:04:50,828 --> 02:04:54,184
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.

1830
02:04:54,468 --> 02:04:57,380
- Take this. It's a couple thousand.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

1831
02:04:57,548 --> 02:04:59,778
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

1832
02:04:59,868 --> 02:05:02,905
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?

1833
02:05:02,988 --> 02:05:04,819
Pick out a few for yourself.

1834
02:05:05,628 --> 02:05:07,539
- For my mom.
- Yeah, whatever.

1835
02:05:07,788 --> 02:05:10,097
Not here. In the store on the corner.

1836
02:05:10,348 --> 02:05:12,816
It's swag, so I got it down on the corner.

1837
02:05:18,468 --> 02:05:20,299
Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you.

1838
02:05:20,388 --> 02:05:21,867
- Thanks.
- Don't worry.

1839
02:05:22,108 --> 02:05:24,383
- I'll try.
- He's got to call me.

1840
02:05:27,108 --> 02:05:28,177
Over here?

1841
02:05:28,348 --> 02:05:29,701
Right down there.

1842
02:05:43,708 --> 02:05:45,664
It's over there, on the corner.

1843
02:05:45,948 --> 02:05:47,097
Right there.

1844
02:06:19,468 --> 02:06:21,823
No! Go ahead! It's right there!

1845
02:06:22,108 --> 02:06:24,178
No, Jimmy! I'm in a hurry!

1846
02:06:24,428 --> 02:06:27,147
My mom's watching the kids!
I got to get home!

1847
02:06:27,388 --> 02:06:29,060
I'll come back later!

1848
02:06:56,188 --> 02:06:57,541
What happened?

1849
02:06:58,348 --> 02:06:59,576
Nothing.

1850
02:06:59,948 --> 02:07:02,382
- What happened?
- I just got scared.

1851
02:07:05,148 --> 02:07:06,581
Got the keys?

1852
02:07:07,868 --> 02:07:09,062
What happened?

1853
02:07:09,228 --> 02:07:11,458
I just got scared. It's okay.

1854
02:07:11,628 --> 02:07:13,027
Are you all right?

1855
02:07:19,708 --> 02:07:23,621
<i>If you're part of a crew nobody ever</i>
<i>tells you they're going to kill you.</i>

1856
02:07:24,508 --> 02:07:26,260
<i>It doesn't happen that way.</i>

1857
02:07:26,508 --> 02:07:29,705
<i>There aren't any arguments</i>
<i>or curses like in the movies.</i>

1858
02:07:29,948 --> 02:07:33,623
<i>Your murderers come with smiles.</i>
<i>They come as your friends.</i>

1859
02:07:34,028 --> 02:07:36,098
<i>People who cared for you all your life.</i>

1860
02:07:36,188 --> 02:07:40,659
<i>They always seem to come when you're</i>
<i>weakest and most in need of their help.</i>

1861
02:07:40,908 --> 02:07:43,866
<i>So I met Jimmy in a crowded place</i>
<i>we both knew.</i>

1862
02:07:44,108 --> 02:07:47,703
<i>I got there 15 minutes early</i>
<i>and Jimmy was already there.</i>

1863
02:07:48,348 --> 02:07:52,739
<i>He took the booth near the window</i>
<i>so he could see everyone who drove up.</i>

1864
02:07:53,068 --> 02:07:55,377
<i>He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.</i>

1865
02:07:55,628 --> 02:07:58,426
<i>He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.</i>

1866
02:07:59,308 --> 02:08:02,266
<i>On the surface,</i>
<i>everything was supposed to be fine.</i>

1867
02:08:02,508 --> 02:08:04,817
<i>We were supposed to be discussing</i>
<i>my case.</i>

1868
02:08:04,908 --> 02:08:09,538
<i>But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying</i>
<i>to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.</i>

1869
02:08:11,068 --> 02:08:14,583
I been telling you your whole life,
don't talk on the phone.

1870
02:08:14,828 --> 02:08:16,341
Now you understand?

1871
02:08:18,988 --> 02:08:22,458
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat this case.

1872
02:08:25,388 --> 02:08:29,540
Well, you know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?

1873
02:08:32,028 --> 02:08:36,465
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon
as he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

1874
02:08:38,348 --> 02:08:40,942
I know where he is. He's hiding out.

1875
02:08:42,028 --> 02:08:43,541
Know what I'm saying?

1876
02:08:48,188 --> 02:08:51,703
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

1877
02:08:54,188 --> 02:08:55,701
No, not at all.

1878
02:08:56,988 --> 02:08:58,706
That way they got nothing.

1879
02:09:07,068 --> 02:09:09,946
<i>Jimmy had never asked me</i>
<i>to whack somebody before.</i>

1880
02:09:10,188 --> 02:09:14,181
<i>But now he's asking me to go to Florida</i>
<i>and do a hit with Anthony.</i>

1881
02:09:20,828 --> 02:09:24,741
<i>That's when I knew I would never</i>
<i>have come back from Florida alive.</i>

1882
02:09:37,308 --> 02:09:40,664
Wherever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again...

1883
02:09:40,828 --> 02:09:43,058
...I don't want to go any place cold.

1884
02:09:43,868 --> 02:09:45,620
You don't have a choice.

1885
02:09:46,348 --> 02:09:49,101
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

1886
02:09:49,548 --> 02:09:51,937
...just no place cold. Do that for me.

1887
02:09:52,188 --> 02:09:54,179
He's bronchial, that's why.

1888
02:09:54,428 --> 02:09:56,817
If he's bronchial we'll consider that.

1889
02:09:56,988 --> 02:09:58,819
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

1890
02:09:58,908 --> 02:10:02,218
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

1891
02:10:03,668 --> 02:10:04,737
What about them?

1892
02:10:04,828 --> 02:10:08,104
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

1893
02:10:08,348 --> 02:10:10,862
Don't I have some kind of contact
with them?

1894
02:10:11,228 --> 02:10:12,183
No.

1895
02:10:13,308 --> 02:10:16,664
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me...

1896
02:10:16,908 --> 02:10:20,901
...if something happens to my parents
and they get sick, I can't see them?

1897
02:10:20,988 --> 02:10:23,866
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick.

1898
02:10:24,108 --> 02:10:26,668
If there's extraordinary circumstances...

1899
02:10:26,908 --> 02:10:29,706
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

1900
02:10:30,348 --> 02:10:32,339
I can't leave my parents.

1901
02:10:33,628 --> 02:10:35,619
Karen, I told you before.

1902
02:10:36,508 --> 02:10:39,898
I'm not going to do this unless
you and the kids come with me.

1903
02:10:41,548 --> 02:10:43,539
I can't do it without you.

1904
02:10:43,788 --> 02:10:46,302
So you do whatever, but... that's it.

1905
02:10:48,988 --> 02:10:51,548
- You need Henry, not me, right?
- That's right.

1906
02:10:51,788 --> 02:10:53,858
I don't care whether you go or not.

1907
02:10:54,428 --> 02:10:57,704
If it'll make him a better witness,
I want you with him.

1908
02:10:57,948 --> 02:10:59,461
They don't want me.

1909
02:10:59,548 --> 02:11:03,063
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.

1910
02:11:03,388 --> 02:11:06,585
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

1911
02:11:06,748 --> 02:11:09,308
If he goes into the program
you're in danger.

1912
02:11:09,468 --> 02:11:11,698
- I don't know anything.
- Don't give me...

1913
02:11:11,788 --> 02:11:13,301
...the babe-in-the-woods routine.

1914
02:11:13,388 --> 02:11:17,540
I've listened to those wiretaps
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

1915
02:11:17,788 --> 02:11:21,542
Conversation after conversation
you talked to Henry on the phone.

1916
02:11:25,948 --> 02:11:28,587
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...

1917
02:11:28,748 --> 02:11:31,387
...or stays on the streets, he's a dead man.

1918
02:11:31,948 --> 02:11:33,779
He knows it and you know it.

1919
02:11:35,068 --> 02:11:37,343
What about the kids and school?

1920
02:11:37,788 --> 02:11:39,301
I mean, what goes on?

1921
02:11:40,028 --> 02:11:42,019
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

1922
02:11:42,108 --> 02:11:44,417
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

1923
02:11:44,508 --> 02:11:47,784
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

1924
02:11:48,188 --> 02:11:51,863
We'll save your life, his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.

1925
02:11:54,988 --> 02:11:57,946
This morning you told the jury
about your background.

1926
02:11:58,028 --> 02:12:00,337
<i>It was easy for us to disappear.</i>

1927
02:12:00,588 --> 02:12:04,740
<i>My house was in my mother-in-law's name.</i>
<i>My cars were registered to my wife.</i>

1928
02:12:04,908 --> 02:12:08,184
<i>My Social Security cards</i>
<i>and driver's licenses were phonies.</i>

1929
02:12:08,428 --> 02:12:10,578
<i>I never voted or paid taxes.</i>

1930
02:12:11,068 --> 02:12:15,300
<i>My birth certificate and arrest sheet</i>
<i>were all that showed I was alive.</i>

1931
02:12:15,468 --> 02:12:18,028
- Do you see him here in this courtroom?
- Yes.

1932
02:12:18,348 --> 02:12:21,146
Will you please point him out for the jury?

1933
02:12:23,148 --> 02:12:27,539
Let the record show that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

1934
02:12:29,148 --> 02:12:31,537
Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?

1935
02:12:31,788 --> 02:12:34,018
- Do you see him in the courtroom?
- Yes.

1936
02:12:34,268 --> 02:12:36,657
Can you point him out for the jury?

1937
02:12:37,468 --> 02:12:41,541
Let the record show Mr. Hill
identified the defendant Paul Cicero.

1938
02:12:43,308 --> 02:12:44,900
I have a document...

1939
02:12:45,148 --> 02:12:47,821
<i>The hardest thing was leaving the life.</i>

1940
02:12:48,348 --> 02:12:49,986
<i>I still loved the life.</i>

1941
02:12:50,108 --> 02:12:53,896
<i>We were treated like movie stars</i>
<i>with muscle. We had it all.</i>

1942
02:12:54,428 --> 02:12:57,465
<i>Our wives, mothers, kids,</i>
<i>everybody rode along.</i>

1943
02:12:57,868 --> 02:13:01,144
<i>I had paper bags filled with jewelry</i>
<i>stashed in the kitchen.</i>

1944
02:13:01,228 --> 02:13:03,298
<i>I had a bowl of coke next to my bed.</i>

1945
02:13:03,388 --> 02:13:07,063
People call them rats because
they will do anything to survive.

1946
02:13:07,228 --> 02:13:09,059
- Objection!
- Objection sustained.

1947
02:13:09,148 --> 02:13:12,902
- I know nothing about being a rat.
- You know everything about it!

1948
02:13:14,588 --> 02:13:16,897
<i>Anything I wanted was a phone call away.</i>

1949
02:13:16,988 --> 02:13:20,264
<i>Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideouts</i>
<i>all over the city.</i>

1950
02:13:20,508 --> 02:13:22,942
<i>I'd bet 20 grand over a weekend...</i>

1951
02:13:23,148 --> 02:13:27,061
<i>... then blow the winnings in a week</i>
<i>or go to sharks to pay the bookies.</i>

1952
02:13:27,308 --> 02:13:28,661
Didn't matter.

1953
02:13:28,988 --> 02:13:33,140
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go rob some more.

1954
02:13:33,948 --> 02:13:35,620
We ran everything.

1955
02:13:35,948 --> 02:13:39,623
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.

1956
02:13:40,188 --> 02:13:43,976
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

1957
02:13:45,468 --> 02:13:47,106
And now it's all over.

1958
02:13:47,708 --> 02:13:49,664
<i>That's the hardest part.</i>

1959
02:13:50,428 --> 02:13:52,180
<i>Today everything is different.</i>

1960
02:13:52,268 --> 02:13:56,022
<i>There's no action. I have to wait around</i>
<i>like everyone else.</i>

1961
02:13:56,508 --> 02:13:58,499
<i>Can't even get decent food.</i>

1962
02:13:58,748 --> 02:14:01,979
<i>After I got here I ordered spaghetti</i>
<i>with marinara sauce...</i>

1963
02:14:02,108 --> 02:14:04,338
<i>... and I got egg noodles and ketchup.</i>

1964
02:14:04,428 --> 02:14:06,259
<i>I'm an average nobody.</i>

1965
02:14:07,148 --> 02:14:10,026
<i>I get to live the rest of my life</i>
<i>like a schnook.</i>

1966
02:15:27,548 --> 02:15:29,504
