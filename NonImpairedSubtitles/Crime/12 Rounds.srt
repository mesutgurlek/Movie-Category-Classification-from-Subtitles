Molly Porter's phone.

448
00:33:56,698 --> 00:33:59,633
- Let me talk to her.
- [Beeps]

449
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:02,362
[On Speaker]
How do you know she's not dead already?

450
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,869
I'm just teasing, Danny.

Come on. Come on.
Where's your sense of humor?

- Here. Say hello to your boyfriend.
- Danny, please.

454
00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:17,641
<i>- We're in a silver va-</i>
- Molly! Molly, where are you?

455
00:34:17,752 --> 00:34:20,220
That one was for free.

456
00:34:20,322 --> 00:34:22,290
<i>The rest you'll have to earn.</i>

457
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,324
I'm gonna find you.

458
00:34:24,426 --> 00:34:26,986
I'm gonna hunt you down,
and I'm gonna kill you.

459
00:34:27,095 --> 00:34:29,359
<i>Well, you know what?</i>
<i>I look forward to that, Danny.</i>

460
00:34:29,464 --> 00:34:32,661
It's a game.
What, you like games, don't you?

461
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:36,168
Mousetrap, Monopoly, naked Twister.

462
00:34:36,271 --> 00:34:38,330
This one's called 12 Rounds.

463

<i>Round 1- I took your house.</i>
<i>Round 2- I took Molly.</i>

The only way to keep her alive-
you do exactly what I say when I say it.

<i>If you're still standing after all 12 rounds,</i>
<i>well, then you'll have won her back.</i>

466
00:34:50,819 --> 00:34:54,152
You gotta be kidding me. You can't expect me
to believe that you're gonna keep-

467
00:34:54,255 --> 00:34:56,553
Well-You'll believe
what I tell you to believe, Danny.

<i>Okay. Round 3.</i>

In 15 minutes I will be calling
a particular cell phone in the city.

471
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:08,898
Why don't you return to where we first met,
see if you can pick up my scent once again?

472
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:14,402
Okay, uh, Molly said she
was in a silver van, okay?

473
00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:16,443
They can't be more
than six blocks from here.

474

No, no, no. It's just, uh,
