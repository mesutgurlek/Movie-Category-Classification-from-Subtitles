00:00:00,366 --> 00:00:04,215
Once upon a time there was
a band of valiant robbers.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,865
You know, there's no
university of grifting.

3
00:00:07,738 --> 00:00:08,738
I know.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,168
There's no college in con.

5
00:00:10,864 --> 00:00:12,021
Just learn on the job.

6
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:13,239
Exactly.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,428
I mean, how's this,
on the job?

8
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:19,367
I mean,
we're doing nothing.

9
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:25,372
I thought we always
worked as a team.

10
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:28,543
The siamese twins of
good leadership...

11
00:00:28,878 --> 00:00:31,241
Innovation and delegation.

12
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:34,993
Sometimes you gotta learn when
to stand back and let the others shine.

13
00:00:39,683 --> 00:00:42,677
You know, solid leadership
is the key to success.

14
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,252
This one, I mean.

15
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:47,613
By the close of play today
we'll be 30 grand richer.

16
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:49,728
Albert, pro that he is,

17
00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:52,074
has found us a very promising mark

18
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:53,885
in a very unpromising location.

19
00:00:58,255 --> 00:01:00,997
You know, finding a great
mark, it ain't enough.

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,344
You gotta be able to play him,
tease him, mold him,

21
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,599
manipulate him,

22
00:01:06,097 --> 00:01:08,623
maybe even throw in a
little bit of ground bait.

23
00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:12,275
I think you might've dropped this.

24
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:18,409
You've got to make him think you're a
stand up sort of guy, on the one hand.

25
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,594
- To gain a bit of trust.
- Exactly.

26
00:01:21,127 --> 00:01:24,215
Beef up the trust, ladle
on a portion of intrigue.

27
00:01:26,765 --> 00:01:28,975
Because when the mark
next sees our roper,

28
00:01:29,142 --> 00:01:32,822
he has to be sufficiently
curious to step over the line.

29
00:01:34,203 --> 00:01:36,450
- What line?
- The line.

30
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,968
The line that separates civilians
from suckers, honest from dishonest.

31
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:45,384
So this stuff with the envelope,
that's bait, yeah?

32
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:47,536
That's a gravy moment.

33
00:01:47,697 --> 00:01:48,890
Ah, hello again.

34
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:50,695
Would you like to join us?

35
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:56,665
There's a great big roast
turkey in the oven,

36
00:01:57,795 --> 00:02:00,549
but you don't know it's there until...

37
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,449
Until you see the gravy bum.

38
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:06,108
You hear me?

39
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:10,651
He smells Albert's gravy
and he wants some.

40
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:14,187
Now Ash, Ash plays a commercial banker,

41
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:18,201
one who's on the hunt of a very
long and very early retirement,

42
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,156
whilst Albert is a market
inspector, petty official,

43
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:25,118
not adverse to the old backhanded
little bit of hankypanky.

44
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:28,654
You know,
Ash plays a great banker.

45
00:02:29,354 --> 00:02:32,751
He's respectable but, you know,
a little bit dodgy,

46
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:35,015
and he tells our greedy friend
that he has...

47
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:38,673
unlimited and unhindered access
to foreign currency exchanges,

48
00:02:38,794 --> 00:02:39,794
millions of them.

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,096
Dollars to pounds,
pounds to yen,

50
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:43,731
yen to euros,
that sort of thing.

51
00:02:43,907 --> 00:02:45,856
And there's always some left over.

52
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:48,894
Institutional size currency
rarely exchanges exactly,

53
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:52,396
and what I've developed
is a means of removing

54
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:55,935
the surplus foreign currency in cash.

55
00:02:56,364 --> 00:02:59,957
He sells me the foreign
currency at half price,

56
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:02,883
then I make the exchange
and keep the profit.

57
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,655
Half price?

58
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:08,272
Greed is what fuels
the currency side.

59
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,122
After the gravy moment
starts all his juices flowing,

60
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:14,973
then bosh, along
comes the convincer.

61
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:19,135
A nice, fat wad of
fresh grubby cash.

62
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:23,058
Then, uh, you win his confidence
by letting him swap

63
00:03:23,145 --> 00:03:26,092
a few hundred pound
sterling for twice as much currency.

64
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,683
Critical moment here, Billy.

65
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,200
At this precise moment in time,
the mark is ahead.

66
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:34,267
We've given him more money
than he's given us,

67
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:37,272
which is why the roper
needs to find the right man.

68
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:40,499
Take Mr. Yakubi, for example.

69
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:41,946
He loves anything dodgy,

70
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:44,670
black market goods
exploitation, you name it.

71
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:46,860
Slippery as an eel,

72
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:48,645
which is why we'll be here,

73
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:50,872
right next door,
ready to spring into action

74
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,728
if they need backup.

75
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:59,181
Because once the inside man
has sufficiently whetted his appetite,

76
00:03:59,228 --> 00:04:01,905
there's no way the mark
can resist being lured

77
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,123
into just one more trade...
The big one.

78
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,006
This is the moment
he's been waiting for,

79
00:04:10,123 --> 00:04:12,307
because it's no longer
just a few hundred.

80
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:15,252
This time the bar's been
packed a whole lot higher.

81
00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:18,478
Once he's swallowed the hook,
then we move in for the kill.

82
00:04:32,163 --> 00:04:35,879
Once the money's passed,
then comes the jamaican switch.

83
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:38,614
We get the money back
we've just given him.

84
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:41,558
Make a clean getaway
and we're good to go.

85
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:46,809
At this stage, very
little can go wrong.

86
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,788
No good, no good.

87
00:07:46,043 --> 00:07:47,142
Where's Billy?

88
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:49,892
Gone.

89
00:08:21,953 --> 00:08:23,580
It's a bit early for drinks, isn't it?

90
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:25,510
- Boat drinks.
- Ah, boat drinks.

91
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:29,242
You truly know when
sipping a tall glass

92
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,538
at the back of a boat at
sunset that life is good.

93
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:36,038
But we're in a flat in
London and it's morning.

94
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,260
Congratulations, Danny. You've taken
charge of your little crew admirably.

95
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:41,261
Cheers!

96
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:45,698
Hey, I found him.

97
00:08:45,822 --> 00:08:47,447
- Who?
- Our next mark.

98
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:49,071
What mark?
We haven't got a con.

99
00:08:49,171 --> 00:08:50,192
The currency slide.

100
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,727
I scoped out a real 24-carat peach.

101
00:08:53,512 --> 00:08:55,090
But we've just done the slide.

102
00:08:55,324 --> 00:08:56,324
I know.

103
00:08:56,763 --> 00:08:58,599
Believe me, look,
this mark's perfect.

104
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:00,066
No, no, Billy.
No, no, no.

105
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:02,713
We never do the same con twice in a row,

106
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,423
so we can't do
the currency slide again.

107
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:08,887
But-but why not?

108
00:09:09,575 --> 00:09:11,178
Ancient grifter wisdom.

109
00:09:12,197 --> 00:09:13,881
Handed down on tablets of stone.

110
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,523
Even when it's a sure thing?

111
00:09:15,574 --> 00:09:17,363
Especially when it's a sure thing.

112
00:09:17,638 --> 00:09:20,516
Twice would just
be once too many.

113
00:09:21,408 --> 00:09:23,885
You said I could finger the next mark,

114
00:09:23,974 --> 00:09:26,340
find him,
sauce him out, read him.

115
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:28,636
I've done it.

116
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:30,011
Look, I found him.

117
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:31,262
I said maybe.

118
00:09:31,323 --> 00:09:32,950
O- only maybe.

119
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,660
All right, he wants to
learn about being a roper.

120
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:38,012
Ah... And you were
gonna teach him.

121
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:42,070
No... I mean,
obviously Albert would,

122
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,731
you know,
specifics, details.

123
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:47,492
I'd just be more like a
overall thing, you know.

124
00:09:47,592 --> 00:09:48,644
What do you call it?

125
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:50,122
Like a reform teacher.

126
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:51,588
Mentor, you said.

127
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:54,592
Mentor?

128
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:56,091
Was that the word?

129
00:09:56,277 --> 00:09:58,698
- I don't remember saying it.
- Look, I'm a grifter.

130
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:01,809
I know I'm not
in the same league as you guys,

131
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,964
but I'm hungry. I want to learn.

132
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:05,412
Come on, gang, eh?

133
00:10:05,715 --> 00:10:08,470
We got the guys spirits up, yeah.
Team huddle.

134
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:16,885
Billy, looking for the
perfect mark for the slide

135
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:19,150
is not a straightforward job.

136
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:21,362
I mean, he-he has to be...

137
00:10:21,715 --> 00:10:22,715
Greedy.

138
00:10:23,213 --> 00:10:24,213
A gambler.

139
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,536
Basically dishonest.

140
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,281
Well, yes, yeah, yeah.

141
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:31,820
And the mark needs to be primed.

142
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:35,771
He or she needs to be hooked
with a generous convincer.

143
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,729
Think that'll convince him?

144
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,334
Billy, it's not
that we don't think you can do it.

145
00:10:45,623 --> 00:10:46,933
'cause we do.

146
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:49,182
Of course we do.

147
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:50,719
It's just against the rules.

148
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:52,989
No one's doubting
your ability, Billy.

149
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:54,432
I understand.

150
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:55,683
You got rules.

151
00:10:56,186 --> 00:10:57,396
I should know my place.

152
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,784
No, definitely not.

153
00:10:59,121 --> 00:11:00,971
No, absolutely not.

154
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:02,456
No, no, no.

155
00:11:04,182 --> 00:11:05,833
Well, yes and no.

156
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:11,205
What Danny is trying to say is
that even in our profession

157
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,728
there are always exceptions to rules.

158
00:11:14,246 --> 00:11:15,824
Exactly what I was getting to.

159
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,870
Exactly.

160
00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:19,648
So, you take Albert,
you show him your mark,

161
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,036
Albie gives him the big thumbs up.

162
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:23,994
Bosh.

163
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:27,625
So I'm thinking someone in imports.

164
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:30,556
Someone needing to buy,
you know, deal, whatever,

165
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:33,450
in a foreign currency,
someone who's bent,

166
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:35,282
or at least bent-ish.

167
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:39,108
And of course, someone who thinks
he's way too clever to be caught.

168
00:11:40,181 --> 00:11:41,181
And I found him.

169
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:42,433
His name is edwin.

170
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:43,778
He owns a caviar shop.

171
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,714
Right, gentlemen.
Let me get this right.

172
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:51,450
125 grams of the uranium gold,
and a 50 grand tin of the sevruga.

173
00:11:51,932 --> 00:11:54,142
Shame there's no bloody beluga left.

174
00:11:54,183 --> 00:11:55,183
It's a tragedy.

175
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:57,715
I love beluga.

176
00:11:57,931 --> 00:11:59,878
Sadly, there's nothing quite like it.

177
00:12:00,182 --> 00:12:02,472
No. Once you've tasted
a little bit of heaven.

178
00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:03,930
I know.

179
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,917
I blame those bloody eco
warrior bunny huggers.

180
00:12:07,432 --> 00:12:09,858
Soon as they got an
eco protection order

181
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:11,563
slapped on the beluga sturgeon,

182
00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:13,713
whole bloody business has dried up.

183
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:16,287
Well, not the whole trade.

184
00:12:20,762 --> 00:12:22,752
I have my own private supplier.

185
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:32,685
Caviar business,
it's all about cash.

186
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,121
Beluga caviar,

187
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:38,143
the most expensive
fish eggs in the world.

188
00:12:38,994 --> 00:12:41,009
Expensive and illegal.

189
00:12:41,614 --> 00:12:45,348
The beluga sturgeon is
practically extinct and, uh,

190
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,107
inside this tin is the remains
of a very rare animal,

191
00:12:51,057 --> 00:12:53,410
and not just its
remains, its-its eggs,

192
00:12:54,806 --> 00:12:56,858
its only hope of
every breeding canned.

193
00:12:57,557 --> 00:13:01,451
With the right cash edwin here can
put his hands on a never-ending supply.

194
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:04,481
You've chosen very wisely, Billy.

195
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:05,745
Thanks, Albert.

196
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:08,776
Just a pity he won't
be around to work our magic upon.

197
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:10,809
He'll be around.

198
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:14,969
We do a good job on the convincer
and we skin him alive.

199
00:13:15,307 --> 00:13:19,448
No we won't, 'cause he's flying
to another country, very shortly.

200
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,712
He won't be here for us to cash in.

201
00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:26,410
He's flying east,
2,000 miles approximately,

202
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:29,079
crossing through
four time zones ahead.

203
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:34,670
You see, he's already wearing
his twin zone watch in preparation.

204
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,622
His envelope,
franken logo of Maslov Air.

205
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:43,918
That's one of the few airlines
flying into Dagestan.

206
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:45,183
Buying trip.

207
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:49,487
So he's got to get his
hands on a lot of money.

208
00:13:50,546 --> 00:13:51,809
You're absolutely right.

209
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:54,946
What currency do you need
to buy illegal caviar?

210
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:56,735
Rubles.

211
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,919
Gangs of mafia controlled
pirate fisherman organize the trade.

212
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,171
They like rubles.

213
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:02,753
Russian mafia?

214
00:14:02,804 --> 00:14:04,671
I'll tell ya now,
we don't want any of that.

215
00:14:04,672 --> 00:14:07,670
Don't worry. I don't think edwin's
involved with the mafia gang,

216
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:09,197
but he has to deal with them.

217
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:12,446
I'm afraid he's going to be leaving us
tomorrow or the next day.

218
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:13,762
Well, it's just bad luck.

219
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,107
Or very good luck.

220
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,573
He's about to leave the country.

221
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:20,169
He's desperate for currency.

222
00:14:20,508 --> 00:14:21,758
Yeah, but it's too soon.

223
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,072
We haven't had a chance
to chuck in the convincer.

224
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,283
Maybe we don't need to.

225
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:29,420
So you're saying what if this
mark doesn't need convincing.

226
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:30,508
Spooky.

227
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:32,182
It's like you read my mind.

228
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,515
I'm saying our edwin might
already be convinced.

229
00:14:36,462 --> 00:14:39,433
Indeed, a variation on the
currency slide could work,

230
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:42,134
if your mark is so
desperate for a particular

231
00:14:42,135 --> 00:14:44,924
foreign currency that he
doesn't need any convincing.

232
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,321
Don't give me...!

233
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:47,900
Most exchanges in this country

234
00:14:47,946 --> 00:14:49,634
will only let you change small amounts,

235
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:52,445
so edwin will be worried about
not getting enough rubles

236
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:56,148
and pissing off some seriously
cold blooded russian on his own turf

237
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:59,014
on the deepest darkest
fringes of the Caspian sea.

238
00:14:59,638 --> 00:15:00,948
Edwin is desperate.

239
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:02,138
Desperate is good.

240
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:05,279
In a mark,
desperate is an admirable quality.

241
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:08,021
All right. Okay.

242
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:11,266
Let's say he's flying
to  Dagestan in the next day or two.

243
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:12,740
He needs rubles for the buy.

244
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:15,307
Well, it's a lawless place and
those fishermen need something

245
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:18,097
they can use immediately,
something that's fireproof.

246
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:20,256
Globally, rubles are in short supply.

247
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:22,321
Russian treasury keep a tight grip.

248
00:15:23,771 --> 00:15:25,120
Can we get our hands on rubles?

249
00:15:25,121 --> 00:15:26,121
Oh, please.

250
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:30,149
No, I mean 30 grand's worth
in the next two hours?

251
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:32,140
I'm hurt you should even ask.

252
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:42,020
- Post.
- All right, mate.

253
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:44,581
Where have them two gone?
I just pulled their drinks.

254
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:45,634
Don't worry, edward.

255
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:46,831
We'll drink them.

256
00:15:47,457 --> 00:15:49,878
Well, you'll have for them and all then.

257
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:51,176
Oh, we'll pay for 'em.

258
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:54,710
In fact, I'll pay for all the drinks.

259
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,541
I will buy a round.

260
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,084
It's nine pound 20.

261
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:06,021
Keep the change.

262
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:08,355
Keep the change.

263
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:10,137
All right, what is it?

264
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,937
- What?
- What?

265
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:14,746
- What are you gonna do to me?
- I'm paying ya.

266
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,474
I'm tipping ya.

267
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,293
Simple, yet rewarding transaction.

268
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,956
No, this is too weird.

269
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:27,549
No, I'll leave it.
It can wait with all the rest.

270
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,931
Eddie, Edward, Ed.

271
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:30,861
Just take the tenner.

272
00:16:31,442 --> 00:16:32,442
No.

273
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:33,856
You got the wrong bloke.

274
00:16:33,943 --> 00:16:35,042
No, not me.

275
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
I'm not interested.

276
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:43,344
If we do this, it ain't for bread.

277
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:44,696
It ain't even for cake.

278
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,754
It's purely icing.

279
00:16:48,193 --> 00:16:51,852
Any grifter that is in this game purely
for his own entertainment

280
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:54,565
isn't going to be
at liberty for long.

281
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
You're right.

282
00:16:56,691 --> 00:17:00,047
But I think we need
to do this for Billy.

283
00:17:00,564 --> 00:17:03,579
He found us a mark with
huge potential, and what?

284
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:05,891
Now we're gonna piss on
his parade just because

285
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,770
of some ancient
grifter superstion?

286
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:11,164
That is the reason why we never
do the same con twice in a row.

287
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:16,102
An interesting point actually
because technically we're not.

288
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:20,919
Now, if Ash can get the rubles...

289
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:31,617
Then Billy baits him and
creates a little gravy moment.

290
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:36,508
Well, then it's totally edwin's
choice whether he bites or not.

291
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:37,755
Sorry.

292
00:17:38,566 --> 00:17:39,566
I have rubles.

293
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:42,349
I need pounds of sterling.

294
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:43,672
How much can I change?

295
00:17:43,705 --> 00:17:45,006
One hundred maximum.

296
00:17:45,394 --> 00:17:46,394
Okay.

297
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:51,770
My boss, you know, he gives me
all of my men's wages in rubles.

298
00:17:52,394 --> 00:17:53,709
It's better to send home.

299
00:17:54,268 --> 00:17:57,488
But my men, they-they want
sterling money for drinking.

300
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,925
It's 100 maximum.

301
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:11,204
Excuse me.

302
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:12,955
Uh, I make an oath.

303
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,368
You know, I-I don't speak my
language in other man's country.

304
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:20,581
If I am learn English,
I speak only English.

305
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:22,956
That's very admirable.

306
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:25,439
Now, about this currency.

307
00:18:25,685 --> 00:18:28,202
Oh, I love it. I love it.
Do your accent again.

308
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,638
You're very accomplished.

309
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:32,672
You have real talent for improvisation.
You ought to explore it, you know.

310
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:34,916
Being able to ad-lib
your way out of a tight corner...

311
00:18:34,956 --> 00:18:37,036
You sure none of you lot
have seen my phone?

312
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,849
I don't trust you.
Especially you.

313
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:41,699
You could be cloning it or somethin'.

314
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:43,718
And I'll get a phone bill the size of...

315
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:44,719
Well, just ring it.

316
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:46,594
Ring it from the
bar phone, Eddie.

317
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:48,437
You probably put
it down somewhere.

318
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:50,603
I could've swore
I left it on the bar.

319
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:52,847
This is a trick.

320
00:18:52,905 --> 00:18:54,220
This is you doing your...

321
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:56,968
Oh, Danny, give him his phone back.

322
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,284
Ring your bleeding phone.

323
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,344
Eddie, get behind the bar, ring it.

324
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:02,404
It's probably fallen down
the back or something.

325
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:04,656
- Ring it.
- It's ringing.

326
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:08,838
No answer to the phone.

327
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:10,782
So where is it?

328
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:13,154
Ignore him. All right.
He's having a senior moment.

329
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:14,845
Right, you thought
any more about

330
00:19:14,846 --> 00:19:16,608
how you're gonna
choreograph the switch?

331
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:18,422
Yeah, of course.
I've got it all mapped out.

332
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:19,949
There's two cases,
identical.

333
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,404
One's full of rubles.

334
00:19:23,822 --> 00:19:24,822
The other isn't.

335
00:19:25,571 --> 00:19:27,518
The one he's carrying
he's cashed in.

336
00:19:28,072 --> 00:19:30,882
We keep these tight behind
the booth nearest to the door

337
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:32,672
so I can, you know,
do the switch.

338
00:19:33,134 --> 00:19:35,196
And when he comes down
the stairs at 05:00 p.m.,

339
00:19:35,197 --> 00:19:38,384
and I told him to be prompt,
and we gotta make sure that he...

340
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,858
Edwin comes down
the stairs?

341
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:41,421
Where?

342
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,972
You don't mean here?

343
00:19:43,297 --> 00:19:44,454
Let me get this right.

344
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:47,188
You set up the switch in our bar?

345
00:19:50,175 --> 00:19:52,361
- Yeah, that's right.
- Are you out of your mind?

346
00:19:56,124 --> 00:19:57,368
I'll be right over.

347
00:19:58,117 --> 00:19:59,117
Lovely job.

348
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:01,983
Right. I've got to get my phone.
It's been handed in.

349
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,554
So, uh, you're in charge.

350
00:20:04,302 --> 00:20:06,113
- Me?
- All of ya.

351
00:20:06,114 --> 00:20:07,587
Anyone comes in
for a drink,

352
00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:10,390
you take their money and
you put it in the till.

353
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,561
Take their money,
do the thing,

354
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:15,238
and put the money in the till, yeah?
Okay. Yeah. Got it.

355
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:17,081
And no helping yourself.
All right?

356
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:18,613
Definitely,
definitely not.

357
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:19,771
Of course.
Oh, no, no.

358
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:21,614
All right, man.

359
00:20:21,615 --> 00:20:22,615
See you later.

360
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:26,370
All right,
what you want?

361
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:28,823
You have heard
the expression

362
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,491
don't poop on
your stoop, yeah?

363
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:32,407
Yeah, but I-I
thought it through.

364
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:35,488
There's more stuff that could go wrong
if we did it somewhere else.

365
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:37,401
Oh, Billy, we just don't do it.

366
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:39,444
Oh, but Stacie, come on...

367
00:20:40,084 --> 00:20:41,294
Hello. Look who's here.

368
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:43,327
My first customer.

369
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:52,905
All right.
Sorry, sir.

370
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:55,453
What can I get you, boss?

371
00:20:56,595 --> 00:20:58,388
What do you want?
A pint of lager?

372
00:20:58,515 --> 00:20:59,515
Bitzer?

373
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:00,639
Babycham?

374
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,140
Pint of sake?

375
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:04,827
Who's this then?

376
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:08,939
This-this, my friend,
is a very quiet oriental man.

377
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,580
What do you want?
A drink?

378
00:21:11,581 --> 00:21:13,212
Maybe he's a
friend of Eddie's.

379
00:21:13,827 --> 00:21:15,090
You a friend of Eddie's?

380
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,877
Well, maybe we
should call Eddie.

381
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:20,820
He might've caught up
with his phone already.

382
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:26,463
Oh, it's ringing.

383
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:30,148
- You can hear it ringing?
- Yeah, I can hear something.

384
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:31,985
Where is it?

385
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:34,194
I knew he'd left it here.

386
00:22:15,357 --> 00:22:17,600
Sorry, mate.
I just, uh, where's Eddie?

387
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:22,189
And how comes you
got Eddie's phone?

388
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:29,045
Where's Eddie?

389
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:35,925
Eddie lost his phone
and this gentleman found it.

390
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:37,795
Yeah, so what's he waiting for?

391
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,980
Reward.

392
00:22:41,112 --> 00:22:42,112
Okay.

393
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:45,813
This time makes
time number three.

394
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,901
Where is Eddie?

395
00:22:56,363 --> 00:22:57,994
My friend asked you a question.

396
00:23:00,182 --> 00:23:02,021
Direct and polite.

397
00:23:04,245 --> 00:23:07,671
Where is Eddie...

398
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:12,878
Are you looking to get
your face smashed in?

399
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,060
Be careful, Billy.

400
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,560
No, that man needs
to be careful.

401
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,907
You move closer,
I snap wrist.

402
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:24,185
I think first we should
find out where Eddie is.

403
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:27,009
Now you will sit.

404
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:45,340
I think it's only fair
just to let you know that

405
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:48,767
we don't keep any money
or valuables on the property.

406
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:51,795
Except, what's in the till.

407
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:54,744
And listen, you're more
than welcome to that.

408
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:56,604
But what about Eddie?

409
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,350
Eddie's not gonna
quiver over a few quid,

410
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:01,201
not in exchange for us
getting murdered.

411
00:24:01,202 --> 00:24:03,359
I meant what-what has
he done with Eddie?

412
00:24:04,328 --> 00:24:05,643
What do you
want from us?

413
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:08,138
Honor.

414
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,390
Honor?

415
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:11,576
I don't get it.

416
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:12,890
My father.

417
00:24:15,217 --> 00:24:16,427
Do we know
your father?

418
00:24:17,468 --> 00:24:18,468
I mean, do we?

419
00:24:19,217 --> 00:24:21,589
Yeah, and wh-what's this
got to do with Eddie?

420
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,590
Uh, yeah, or us?

421
00:24:23,544 --> 00:24:25,649
We don't know what
you're talking about,

422
00:24:25,781 --> 00:24:27,675
and we definitely
don't know your...

423
00:24:28,822 --> 00:24:29,822
Father.

424
00:24:36,448 --> 00:24:37,923
Well, it's what we've always done.

425
00:24:38,072 --> 00:24:40,491
I know, but it's unprofessional.

426
00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:43,397
I mean, we fill a dummy briefcase

427
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:47,283
full of random piles
of snipped up newsprint.

428
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:48,723
It-it's a bit shoddy.

429
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:51,823
No, no, no.
We have experimented.

430
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:55,254
We used, uh, travel
brochures, paper towels.

431
00:24:55,465 --> 00:24:59,043
We got rid of those two jeffrey archer
novels in that gig in jersey.

432
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:00,214
Well, I thought...

433
00:25:00,965 --> 00:25:03,339
We should do a proper piece
of a search and development

434
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,076
to determine in a
jamaican switch

435
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:08,115
which is the optimum
substitute for banded cash.

436
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,788
Weight and rattle
obviously an issue.

437
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:14,279
It has to weigh the same,
sound right.

438
00:25:15,655 --> 00:25:19,735
I like it. This is proper,
thinking ahead, tweaking a technique.

439
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,206
1,000 pounds in 20's

440
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:28,056
weighs exactly
53.5 grams, right?

441
00:25:30,032 --> 00:25:34,317
This is the book of instant duplicate
sales and ledger invoice receipts.

442
00:25:36,464 --> 00:25:39,425
It is made of paper,
it is bound,

443
00:25:39,902 --> 00:25:45,130
and it weighs exactly 54 grams.

444
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,050
It's a beautiful thing.

445
00:25:58,072 --> 00:25:59,217
I'm sorry, mate.

446
00:25:59,716 --> 00:26:01,558
You're not making any sense at all.

447
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,651
Are you sure you got the right place?

448
00:26:03,652 --> 00:26:07,329
I mean, look, that's just a book
of invoice thingamajiggys, isn't it?

449
00:26:07,841 --> 00:26:09,525
Never seen it before in my life.

450
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:11,713
And none of us have ever seen or heard

451
00:26:11,714 --> 00:26:13,339
of any contact with your father.

452
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,467
We've never met your father.
I'm sorry.

453
00:26:38,589 --> 00:26:40,751
Maybe we can
do a deal.

454
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:47,311
You bring shame to my
family, to my father.

455
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:50,660
Look, mate,
he lost some money.

456
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,674
You really don't want
to take this stuff too seriously.

457
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:57,119
It's what we do, we
con... Shut up, Danny.

458
00:26:57,713 --> 00:26:58,713
Which one did this?

459
00:27:04,402 --> 00:27:07,219
Boss must eat first.

460
00:27:18,464 --> 00:27:19,464
Fugu.

461
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:20,839
Fugu.

462
00:27:21,282 --> 00:27:22,334
Fu who?

463
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:26,006
What exactly is it?
Sushi, is it?

464
00:27:27,903 --> 00:27:28,903
I can do sushi.

465
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:30,626
A bit of raw fish, isn't it?

466
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:31,776
It's a puffer fish.

467
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:33,286
So?

468
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,074
Parts of the puffer fish
contain an neurotoxin

469
00:27:37,341 --> 00:27:39,972
potent enough to kill a man
in less than a minute.

470
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:42,861
If it's wrongly prepared.

471
00:27:43,904 --> 00:27:47,904
Wrongly cut by the chef so accidentally
the toxin has leaked into the flesh.

472
00:27:49,528 --> 00:27:50,528
Or on purpose.

473
00:27:52,142 --> 00:27:53,434
Stupid, isn't it?

474
00:27:53,528 --> 00:27:56,714
I mean, nobody's gonna eat
sushi that's gonna kill you, are they?

475
00:27:56,715 --> 00:28:00,737
In the yakuza culture it is
a supreme act of defiance

476
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:04,328
to stare death in the face.

477
00:28:04,652 --> 00:28:05,652
Yes, death.

478
00:28:07,342 --> 00:28:08,566
One piece touched.

479
00:28:08,776 --> 00:28:13,928
You're telling me that one piece
of this fish is poisonous?

480
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:17,308
Boss will eat first.

481
00:28:20,536 --> 00:28:22,957
You're saying one piece
has touched the knife.

482
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:26,091
What knife?

483
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:31,218
Fugu contains such extreme toxin

484
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,537
that only licensed fugu chefs
are allowed to prepare it.

485
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,905
Training takes ten years.

486
00:28:37,028 --> 00:28:39,512
It's the liver that
contains tetrodotoxin,

487
00:28:39,794 --> 00:28:42,971
a poison 1,200 times more
powerful than cyanide.

488
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,358
The flesh of the puffer fish
isn't poisonous.

489
00:28:47,043 --> 00:28:48,095
They use two knives.

490
00:28:48,486 --> 00:28:50,959
The short one for
eviscerating internal organs.

491
00:28:51,294 --> 00:28:52,978
The large one for
cutting flesh.

492
00:28:55,356 --> 00:28:58,534
But the short knife
has touched one piece.

493
00:29:01,498 --> 00:29:03,803
Look, son, I don't
even know your name.

494
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,467
That's cool. No names.

495
00:29:06,623 --> 00:29:08,856
We all enjoy a little
anonymity here.

496
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:11,438
I just think put it on paper,

497
00:29:11,685 --> 00:29:14,294
set our position
crystal clear, okay.

498
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,810
We ain't gonna eat anything that could,
should, would,

499
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:19,037
or even might be a
little bit moody.

500
00:29:19,248 --> 00:29:21,515
Now, I am the boss here,

501
00:29:22,436 --> 00:29:25,646
and it is me who is responsible
for any shame to your father.

502
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:26,998
Albert.

503
00:29:27,435 --> 00:29:28,435
He's lying.

504
00:29:29,953 --> 00:29:30,953
I'm the boss.

505
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:32,639
What's going on?

506
00:29:33,082 --> 00:29:34,082
These are men.

507
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:37,074
They are far, far too stupid to be boss.
I am the boss.

508
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,075
Like you wish.

509
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:41,099
Look at me.

510
00:29:41,783 --> 00:29:42,783
Hey, kung-fu man!

511
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:44,836
Look at me.

512
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:46,604
I is the boss, yeah.

513
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:50,111
If you believe that,
mate, you're gonna believe anything.

514
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,050
What?

515
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,799
All right.

516
00:30:01,113 --> 00:30:03,208
None of these is boss.

517
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,925
I'm the boss.

518
00:30:10,926 --> 00:30:12,249
Then you eat first.

519
00:30:14,515 --> 00:30:15,705
No.

520
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:18,166
I ain't gonna do it.

521
00:30:19,174 --> 00:30:20,174
And you know what?

522
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:22,176
You can't make me.

523
00:30:41,677 --> 00:30:42,677
Eat.

524
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,363
Okay, I'll eat.

525
00:30:46,557 --> 00:30:47,557
I'll eat.

526
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:49,544
Don't touch Eddie, though.

527
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:50,798
All right?

528
00:30:52,486 --> 00:30:53,486
Give me a piece.

529
00:30:57,361 --> 00:30:59,886
Let fate decide who die.

530
00:31:01,673 --> 00:31:02,673
No wait!

531
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,110
This isn't honor.

532
00:31:05,176 --> 00:31:07,245
This isn't right.
Not-not bushido.

533
00:31:08,424 --> 00:31:10,537
Boss should not go first,

534
00:31:10,677 --> 00:31:12,587
not if he is truly responsible.

535
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:14,675
Yeah, that's right.

536
00:31:15,303 --> 00:31:17,112
First time around should be the easiest.

537
00:31:17,113 --> 00:31:18,735
Think about it.
Do the math.

538
00:31:18,862 --> 00:31:20,598
Odds to kick off
are five to one.

539
00:31:20,737 --> 00:31:23,109
Surely boss is better to
go third or fourth round

540
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,873
when the odds get shorter,
three to one, two to one, until finally.

541
00:31:25,911 --> 00:31:28,174
Thanks, Ash. I'm just trying
to do the right thing here.

542
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:29,717
Odds get shorter

543
00:31:29,852 --> 00:31:32,340
unless someone else gets unlucky
and they go first.

544
00:31:32,437 --> 00:31:34,154
- Then all bets are off.
- Exactly.

545
00:31:34,613 --> 00:31:35,981
What exactly are the odds?

546
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:38,862
Well, it's a simple matter
of ramp the escalation.

547
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:42,599
The odds shorten with all the remaing
players that are rated 20 to one.

548
00:31:43,175 --> 00:31:46,753
Yeah, you know, it's a little bit like,
chase the ace, isn't it?

549
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:48,597
So when is the
safest time to go?

550
00:31:48,676 --> 00:31:51,297
Well, it depends what model
you calculate your odds by.

551
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:53,350
And your position in
the pecking order.

552
00:31:53,923 --> 00:31:55,860
You being a minor rank
will probably go last,

553
00:31:55,861 --> 00:31:57,439
which of course,
not so great.

554
00:31:57,614 --> 00:32:00,719
You get to that last point,
no one else is dead, and you...

555
00:32:03,738 --> 00:32:04,738
Eat.

556
00:32:07,685 --> 00:32:10,169
All right, so I get a choice, yeah?

557
00:32:11,424 --> 00:32:14,892
Death by poison or,
uh, or my throat cut.

558
00:32:17,156 --> 00:32:18,301
It's all right.

559
00:32:18,484 --> 00:32:19,484
I'm cool.

560
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:21,898
We're cool,
aren't we, mate?

561
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:24,797
Just having a little,
uh, debate here.

562
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,229
You see,
I'm not convinced

563
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,589
eating the fish
is my best option.

564
00:32:31,746 --> 00:32:35,919
I'm just thinking...
if I don't eat the fish,

565
00:32:37,347 --> 00:32:39,012
will he really cut my...

566
00:32:43,423 --> 00:32:45,238
- Eat.
- Yeah. Okay.

567
00:32:45,752 --> 00:32:46,752
I'm eating.

568
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:47,815
I'm eating.

569
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,748
How long does it take if it's...

570
00:32:57,126 --> 00:32:58,600
A minute or two tops.

571
00:32:59,376 --> 00:33:01,218
You'll feel a tingling on your lips

572
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:03,215
if the fugu toxin is present.

573
00:33:06,946 --> 00:33:09,601
So I might've just eaten
my last mouthful then.

574
00:33:12,254 --> 00:33:13,569
My whole body's tingling.

575
00:33:14,377 --> 00:33:16,008
Your heartbeat
will accelerate.

576
00:33:16,504 --> 00:33:18,082
You'll have a
sense of nausea,

577
00:33:19,168 --> 00:33:21,885
shortness of breath,
dizziness.

578
00:33:24,942 --> 00:33:26,126
I got all those.

579
00:33:27,126 --> 00:33:28,283
Is there any antidote?

580
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,202
No antitoxin.

581
00:33:31,112 --> 00:33:35,241
Fugu a lesson in beauty,
pleasure, and death.

582
00:33:36,204 --> 00:33:37,309
But you're not dying.

583
00:33:38,238 --> 00:33:39,238
Not worthy.

584
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:42,611
Not worthy?

585
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:44,611
You next.

586
00:33:44,862 --> 00:33:45,914
No, no. No, me next.

587
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,112
- You let me go next.
- No, it's my turn, isn't it?

588
00:33:49,113 --> 00:33:50,735
Sorry, mate,
can I just confirm?

589
00:33:50,736 --> 00:33:53,051
Does that mean I'm
definitely not gonna die?

590
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:55,116
I think I should go next.

591
00:33:56,238 --> 00:33:57,290
I'm next in command.

592
00:33:57,673 --> 00:33:58,673
Who says?

593
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:04,964
As I'm, uh, no longer in the line,

594
00:34:05,175 --> 00:34:07,672
maybe I shouldn't have a
little say in this but, uh,

595
00:34:07,673 --> 00:34:11,610
seems to me that, next in line
from a seniority point of view.

596
00:34:11,611 --> 00:34:12,611
You eat.

597
00:34:13,283 --> 00:34:14,949
Whoa, whoa. Oh, mate.

598
00:34:15,112 --> 00:34:17,429
You're jumping all over
the chain of command here.

599
00:34:17,528 --> 00:34:19,548
All right, I really think
it's better, all right,

600
00:34:19,549 --> 00:34:22,112
you come back tomorrow when
you got a much clearer picture

601
00:34:22,113 --> 00:34:23,744
of how everything's run here...

602
00:34:25,735 --> 00:34:26,735
Eat.

603
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,246
You dishonor my father.

604
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:59,436
You bring him shame
and make him soft and weak.

605
00:35:00,653 --> 00:35:03,495
I think it was your father's greed
that made him weak.

606
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,867
Tell me, how deep was
your father's shame?

607
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:16,121
Warrior who is disgraced
can redeem himself only one way.

608
00:35:17,555 --> 00:35:18,764
Saboku.

609
00:35:20,602 --> 00:35:21,951
He committed saboku?

610
00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:24,438
Is that as bad
as it sounds?

611
00:35:25,341 --> 00:35:28,551
A fallen warrior can still die
a hero by committing a ritual.

612
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:30,129
You have no honor.

613
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:32,213
You thieves.

614
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,103
You live by lies.

615
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:37,151
We do have honor.

616
00:35:38,779 --> 00:35:39,904
We have a code.

617
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:42,776
Eye for an eye.

618
00:35:43,276 --> 00:35:44,276
A life for a life.

619
00:35:45,713 --> 00:35:47,902
Not quite so brutal, we're
a little bit more

620
00:35:47,903 --> 00:35:49,692
evolved in this neck of the woods.

621
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:55,563
We do have honor.

622
00:35:58,525 --> 00:35:59,525
Then show me.

623
00:36:26,798 --> 00:36:27,798
Help him!

624
00:36:30,423 --> 00:36:32,970
Help him, please!
Oh, god, do something!

625
00:36:34,298 --> 00:36:35,982
This man is like a father to me.

626
00:36:36,297 --> 00:36:38,094
This man is worth 20 men!

627
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:41,905
If he dies, mate, I swear
to god I'm gonna find you

628
00:36:41,988 --> 00:36:43,409
and then I'm gonna kill ya,

629
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,136
and then I'll kill you again!

630
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:12,291
You heartless little shit!

631
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:14,799
No, it's all right,
Stacie.

632
00:37:14,877 --> 00:37:15,877
It's all right.

633
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,250
He knows.

634
00:37:19,936 --> 00:37:21,984
You never seen man die from fugu.

635
00:37:22,687 --> 00:37:23,792
He not die like this.

636
00:37:24,187 --> 00:37:25,239
Oh, give me a break.

637
00:37:26,249 --> 00:37:30,034
Tetrodotoxin,
the most lethal of neurotoxin,

638
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,023
it works by blocking all
the channels to the brain

639
00:37:33,172 --> 00:37:35,119
to produce a rapid and violent death.

640
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:39,353
See? You have no honor.

641
00:37:41,546 --> 00:37:43,335
Symptoms include muscle twitching,

642
00:37:43,546 --> 00:37:45,914
horrific chest pain
and respiratory distress.

643
00:37:46,295 --> 00:37:47,440
You are cheat.

644
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:50,147
Yeah? What part of my death
didn't look right then, eh?

645
00:37:50,198 --> 00:37:52,671
For what it's worth,
I thought it was a bloody good effort. 

646
00:37:52,672 --> 00:37:53,724
Thank you very much.

647
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:55,608
- Got you, didn't it?
- No.

648
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:57,233
Yes, it did.
No.

649
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:58,858
Sit down.

650
00:37:59,306 --> 00:38:00,306
Bloody did.

651
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,611
Sit!

652
00:38:05,298 --> 00:38:07,910
Now, just two fugu.

653
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:10,610
Excuse me.

654
00:38:11,547 --> 00:38:15,173
You talk about honor,
what a big deal it is,

655
00:38:15,922 --> 00:38:18,762
and you're about to kill
a woman and an old man.

656
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,882
Sorry, Albie.

657
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,666
I mean, please tell me,
where is the honor in that?

658
00:38:25,797 --> 00:38:28,007
It is fate who decides
which one will die.

659
00:38:28,797 --> 00:38:31,235
Oh, right.
So what you're telling me is

660
00:38:31,612 --> 00:38:35,063
if we choose the piece of fugu,
then it's not your fault.

661
00:38:36,598 --> 00:38:37,800
Bulshit!

662
00:38:38,913 --> 00:38:39,913
Way to go, Stace.

663
00:38:41,034 --> 00:38:43,978
Looks like you're jumping right
to the front of the fugu cue.

664
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:48,532
How could a death
bring you honor?

665
00:38:49,925 --> 00:38:50,925
Blood revenge.

666
00:38:51,286 --> 00:38:53,165
Eye for an eye.

667
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,313
So you think killing
one of us is your duty?

668
00:38:59,174 --> 00:39:00,805
Well, for our team,
our family,

669
00:39:01,488 --> 00:39:05,312
we honor each other in life,
not just in death.

670
00:39:06,674 --> 00:39:10,377
For us, honor is about care
and protection and love, not revenge.

671
00:39:17,603 --> 00:39:19,631
Let me eat both of
those, both fugi.

672
00:39:21,363 --> 00:39:22,363
For me.

673
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:23,780
Let me have my honor.

674
00:39:24,614 --> 00:39:26,858
No, Albie. I won't allow it. No way.

675
00:39:27,487 --> 00:39:30,223
Touch the box and I call
for your friend to be hurt.

676
00:39:34,925 --> 00:39:36,240
Tell me about your honor.

677
00:39:39,862 --> 00:39:40,862
It was me.

678
00:39:42,361 --> 00:39:45,438
I was the one who chose your father
to be the victim of our crime.

679
00:39:47,362 --> 00:39:48,835
I am what we call the roper.

680
00:39:50,548 --> 00:39:53,617
I calculate the risks and
suitability of the mark,

681
00:39:55,084 --> 00:39:56,909
or the victim.

682
00:39:59,174 --> 00:40:03,310
When I saw your father,
I- I saw not honor.

683
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,374
I saw greed.

684
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:07,050
I saw weakness.

685
00:40:07,676 --> 00:40:11,539
I saw a big, fat pig ready
to be taken to the slaughter.

686
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,082
This is real smooth talking, Albie.

687
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:15,913
I chose your father.

688
00:40:16,738 --> 00:40:17,738
My responsibility.

689
00:40:18,862 --> 00:40:20,298
But I didn't take away his honor,

690
00:40:20,299 --> 00:40:22,088
and we didn't take away his honor.

691
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:28,022
He lost his honor a
long, long time ago.

692
00:40:29,424 --> 00:40:31,798
Oh. Go ahead.

693
00:40:32,549 --> 00:40:33,549
Cut my throat.

694
00:40:33,755 --> 00:40:34,932
Kill me. Huh?

695
00:40:34,988 --> 00:40:37,247
Let me bleed to death in this chair.

696
00:40:37,675 --> 00:40:40,172
My blood, is that the honor you want?

697
00:40:43,238 --> 00:40:44,711
All right.
Everybody just...

698
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,009
All right, listen,

699
00:40:46,086 --> 00:40:49,017
just ignore everything
that he just said, okay,

700
00:40:49,535 --> 00:40:53,162
'cause what he meant
to say was... How much?

701
00:40:54,673 --> 00:40:56,067
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

702
00:40:57,574 --> 00:41:00,471
Just how much to make
you go away, hey?

703
00:41:01,316 --> 00:41:04,535
You offer me money
for my father's honor?

704
00:41:06,314 --> 00:41:07,999
Yeah, it usually works.

705
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:10,250
Go on, go on,
name your price.

706
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:13,297
I mean, just how
precious was this honor?

707
00:41:18,236 --> 00:41:21,390
I- I know where there's a lot of money.

708
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:27,359
A whole case full of money,

709
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:30,369
and it's just over there.

710
00:41:31,497 --> 00:41:37,188
If you let me stand up,
yeah, I'll go and get it,

711
00:41:39,252 --> 00:41:41,000
bring it back here,

712
00:41:41,515 --> 00:41:43,301
I'll give it to you,

713
00:41:43,499 --> 00:41:46,536
and you-you can have it.

714
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,753
All of it.
All our money.

715
00:41:50,296 --> 00:41:51,506
I'm gonna stand up now.

716
00:41:52,797 --> 00:41:53,797
Everybody's cool.

717
00:41:55,608 --> 00:41:56,608
Everybody's cool.

718
00:42:00,171 --> 00:42:01,223
This is a good plan.

719
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:03,749
This is a leader's plan.

720
00:42:05,045 --> 00:42:09,654
Good leadership is defined by clear
decision making and direct action.

721
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:14,049
Once a man has truly accepted
his role as a leader,

722
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,996
once he's given himself willingly
to the office of leadership,

723
00:42:19,676 --> 00:42:21,581
then, and only then

724
00:42:22,176 --> 00:42:26,103
will he discover the true power
that lurks deep within.

725
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,038
Danny, I was so scared.

726
00:43:40,609 --> 00:43:41,609
I thought you...

727
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:55,295
Oh, my hero.

728
00:43:58,607 --> 00:43:59,607
Sit.

729
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,860
Sit!

730
00:44:08,201 --> 00:44:11,671
You insult my father,
#my family.

731
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:14,168
Money cannot buy honor.

732
00:44:14,817 --> 00:44:15,817
Only death.

733
00:44:18,254 --> 00:44:19,254
Then kill me.

734
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:22,881
Kill me!

735
00:44:42,256 --> 00:44:43,256
Who was that?

736
00:44:43,506 --> 00:44:44,506
Lie down.

737
00:44:45,254 --> 00:44:46,254
Lie down.

738
00:44:46,388 --> 00:44:47,388
Now!

739
00:44:47,755 --> 00:44:48,755
You next.

740
00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:50,414
Lie down.
What's the matter?

741
00:44:50,445 --> 00:44:51,818
What's happened?
Lie down.

742
00:44:52,091 --> 00:44:53,102
Lie down.

743
00:44:53,444 --> 00:44:54,648
You, down.

744
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,584
Down! Move!

745
00:44:58,007 --> 00:44:59,951
Don't move, don't talk.

746
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:02,920
Anybody move, anybody
talk, your friend dies.

747
00:45:08,278 --> 00:45:09,746
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

748
00:45:16,862 --> 00:45:17,862
Is he gone?

749
00:45:19,177 --> 00:45:20,177
Yeah, I think so.

750
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,550
Where has he gone?

751
00:45:24,048 --> 00:45:25,311
Yeah, and where's Eddie?

752
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:26,736
Come on!

753
00:45:27,285 --> 00:45:28,489
Get me out of this.

754
00:45:30,744 --> 00:45:31,744
Which way?

755
00:45:32,176 --> 00:45:34,438
You go that way.
I'll meet you around the corner.

756
00:45:34,439 --> 00:45:36,362
Hey, they're gone,
the cases.

757
00:45:36,814 --> 00:45:38,751
The little bastard has
stolen the briefcases.

758
00:45:38,752 --> 00:45:40,565
- He took everything.
- Oh, bloody hell.

759
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:42,376
It was you who said
we had lots of money.

760
00:45:42,377 --> 00:45:45,003
Well, I stopped him
chopping Albert's bleeding head off.

761
00:45:45,004 --> 00:45:46,004
Forget the money.

762
00:45:46,251 --> 00:45:47,514
They've still got Eddie.

763
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,720
She wasn't there, and then she was.

764
00:45:57,005 --> 00:45:58,005
Get an ambulance.

765
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,909
Put her into recovery position.
I'll get a blanket.

766
00:46:03,537 --> 00:46:05,010
I need an ambulance, please.

767
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:08,345
Hey, that's him. That's the mark.

768
00:46:08,346 --> 00:46:09,503
Don't let him see you.

769
00:46:12,598 --> 00:46:14,409
Hey! Wait!
That's my case.

770
00:46:24,754 --> 00:46:26,777
Um, what just happened?

771
00:46:26,974 --> 00:46:29,632
I may be mistaken,
but I think we just got screwed.

772
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:31,923
I don't care about the money.
They've still got Eddie.

773
00:46:31,983 --> 00:46:33,033
They? Who?

774
00:46:33,034 --> 00:46:34,560
Who are we dealing with here?

775
00:46:36,848 --> 00:46:37,848
The phone.

776
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,160
Eddie's phone.

777
00:46:41,783 --> 00:46:42,888
Check the caller I.d.

778
00:46:43,347 --> 00:46:44,399
See who just called.

779
00:46:44,542 --> 00:46:46,096
No chance. It'll be without.

780
00:46:46,097 --> 00:46:48,345
No, no.
There's a number. Local. What's this?

781
00:46:48,381 --> 00:46:50,138
- All right, ring it.
- That's a bad idea.

782
00:46:50,178 --> 00:46:51,606
What?
No. Billy's right.

783
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,593
What if calling the number is some sort
of signal to whoever's got Eddie?

784
00:46:54,633 --> 00:46:55,902
What else are we gonna do?

785
00:46:55,971 --> 00:46:59,518
I think it's a good idea, too.
I don't think we should just sit here.

786
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,475
That wasn't here earlier.

787
00:47:02,284 --> 00:47:03,284
That's new post.

788
00:47:03,772 --> 00:47:05,283
We don't get two deliveries a day.

789
00:47:05,284 --> 00:47:07,020
No one gets two
deliveries a day.

790
00:47:07,536 --> 00:47:08,536
Here.

791
00:47:08,596 --> 00:47:09,911
No, this is
today's mail.

792
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So earlier.

793
00:47:15,347 --> 00:47:16,347
Post.

794
00:47:16,409 --> 00:47:17,409
All right, mate.

795
00:47:18,223 --> 00:47:19,594
Hey, where have them two gone?

796
00:47:19,595 --> 00:47:21,016
I just poured 
their drinks.

797
00:47:21,096 --> 00:47:23,377
Someone faked being
a postman just to get Eddie's phone.

798
00:47:23,417 --> 00:47:25,112
So they could get Eddie out of the bar.

799
00:47:26,534 --> 00:47:27,764
Eddie, are you okay?

800
00:47:30,658 --> 00:47:31,658
What happened?

801
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,489
What did they do to you?

802
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:35,967
Um, foot massage,

803
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,470
and-and that thing where
they stick needles in you,

804
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:39,681
the, um...
Acupuncture.

805
00:47:40,096 --> 00:47:41,096
Yeah, that's it.

806
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:42,659
Who did?

807
00:47:44,721 --> 00:47:45,878
Oh, sweet mary mother.

808
00:47:48,502 --> 00:47:49,502
What? Jeez!

809
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:53,220
I've only been gone a
couple of hours and you...

810
00:47:54,783 --> 00:47:57,776
Eddie, this really isn't how it looks.

811
00:47:57,936 --> 00:47:59,782
- Really.
- Oh, I see. No, I get it.

812
00:47:59,783 --> 00:48:01,158
So that's what the all the,

813
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:03,535
"Eddie are you all right?"
that's what all that was about,

814
00:48:03,552 --> 00:48:05,533
and here's me thinking
that you actually cared.

815
00:48:05,534 --> 00:48:07,270
Eddie, mate, where
have you been?

816
00:48:08,848 --> 00:48:10,916
Well, I got a call from that girl

817
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:13,408
who said my phone had been
handed in at her shop.

818
00:48:13,409 --> 00:48:14,409
Girl?

819
00:48:18,658 --> 00:48:20,184
So when I get around there...

820
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:32,511
Hello. Uh, now, look.

821
00:48:34,221 --> 00:48:36,043
Now, look, I'm still
waiting on my phone.

822
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,288
Listen, where's the girl
that speaks English?

823
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:45,682
No, she said - she said she'd
just gone to fetch the phone.

824
00:48:45,862 --> 00:48:47,335
Where was this place, Eddie?

825
00:48:48,045 --> 00:48:49,045
Castleby street.

826
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:52,108
You know, the one next to that
posh japanese restaurant.

827
00:48:52,109 --> 00:48:54,296
That sounds like the
place that me and you...

828
00:48:54,297 --> 00:48:55,297
Is that my phone?

829
00:48:56,297 --> 00:48:57,560
What's that doing there?

830
00:48:58,857 --> 00:48:59,857
Who had that?

831
00:49:00,718 --> 00:49:01,928
Which bloody one of ya?

832
00:49:03,297 --> 00:49:05,972
Oh, I see. You set me up
to get me out of the way,

833
00:49:06,233 --> 00:49:08,856
so you get up to some
of your bloody monkey business.

834
00:49:08,857 --> 00:49:10,225
Eddie, let me explain.
No!

835
00:49:10,299 --> 00:49:12,877
You lot must think I'm
softer than a bunny's ass.

836
00:49:12,982 --> 00:49:15,398
Well, that's it.
I'm not standing for this anymore.

837
00:49:15,922 --> 00:49:16,922
Not this time.

838
00:49:17,482 --> 00:49:20,297
This time none of ya are going
anywhere until this place

839
00:49:20,298 --> 00:49:22,613
is put back exactly like
it was when I left.

840
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:30,489
How did we not
see that coming?

841
00:49:33,797 --> 00:49:35,744
You got any idea
when he got onto us?

842
00:49:37,232 --> 00:49:38,232
The photo.

843
00:49:39,046 --> 00:49:40,572
That was taken
at the switch.

844
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:47,609
Yeah, but how?

845
00:49:48,422 --> 00:49:51,686
I kept my eye on anyone in that club
that even smelled of a threat.

846
00:49:55,654 --> 00:49:58,415
Come to think of it,
there was a little girl.

847
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:00,998
But how could she be a threat?

848
00:50:01,672 --> 00:50:03,514
And what's her link to Mr. Samural?

849
00:50:07,607 --> 00:50:08,817
He wasn't just onto us.

850
00:50:09,984 --> 00:50:11,789
He was way ahead of us.

851
00:50:12,748 --> 00:50:13,748
He knew everything.

852
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:15,655
But how, for god sake?

853
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,302
And how could he then
know about edwin?

854
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:22,469
Unless he was watching Billy.

855
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:25,688
No, no, no.

856
00:50:26,186 --> 00:50:29,028
Look, when I met edwin,
wasn't no other guys in range.

857
00:50:29,124 --> 00:50:31,176
No faces watching us,
no tell, nothing.

858
00:50:31,718 --> 00:50:33,463
I don't miss stuff like that.

859
00:50:40,436 --> 00:50:42,857
He even knew what we
packed in the dummy case.

860
00:51:12,437 --> 00:51:13,437
It's beautiful.

861
00:51:14,186 --> 00:51:15,779
Absolutely exquisite.

862
00:51:17,686 --> 00:51:20,211
I have to say I love it.

863
00:51:21,436 --> 00:51:22,857
I think we've
been honored.

864
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:26,263
We've witnessed a truly
great performance.

865
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:30,383
But he cheated you... Us.

866
00:51:31,748 --> 00:51:33,379
He spun a beautiful web, Billy,

867
00:51:33,562 --> 00:51:36,080
and we climbed right in, willingly.

868
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:37,683
Made us feel guilty.

869
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,250
It's like we crossed
a forbidden line,

870
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:45,244
wronged an honorable man who's only
recourse was to take his own life.

871
00:51:45,999 --> 00:51:48,314
Why did he need to get
Eddie out of the way?

872
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Leverage.

873
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:52,215
He couldn't scare us
enough with...

874
00:51:53,063 --> 00:51:55,484
And he could lever us
with Eddie's kidnapping.

875
00:52:00,046 --> 00:52:01,046
Smart.

876
00:52:01,796 --> 00:52:04,247
Well, whoever he is,
he got moves.

877
00:52:04,296 --> 00:52:06,717
Yeah, well, we might
never find out who he is.

878
00:52:07,047 --> 00:52:09,941
It might be just one
of those weird unexplained things.

879
00:52:10,674 --> 00:52:14,602
So we were terrorized by pieces
of fish that weren't poisonous.

880
00:52:15,984 --> 00:52:16,984
So it would seem.

881
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:21,047
Something doesn't add up.

882
00:52:21,608 --> 00:52:23,134
They might've
been poisonous.

883
00:52:23,234 --> 00:52:24,234
No, no chance.

884
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,893
That's how he knew I was
acting being poisoned.

885
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,935
They must've been fakes.

886
00:52:29,741 --> 00:52:32,294
- Come on, Danny...
- Or, you were not a very good actor.

887
00:52:32,295 --> 00:52:34,683
Oh, please. Come...
I was bang on the money.

888
00:52:35,237 --> 00:52:39,542
Speedy reaction, range of symptoms,
the spasms, the spittle.

889
00:52:40,731 --> 00:52:43,482
Without a doubt, the second
great performance of the day.

890
00:52:43,483 --> 00:52:46,201
Yeah, you're just numb 'cause
I got you good and proper with me...

891
00:52:50,422 --> 00:52:51,422
No, you didn't.

892
00:52:51,733 --> 00:52:53,785
"oh, this man was
like a father to me."

893
00:52:54,734 --> 00:52:58,070
sorry, Danny, but, um,
how many men was I worth?

894
00:52:59,423 --> 00:53:01,919
You know, there are
times when watching you two

895
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,183
swinging your at
each other is quite funny,

896
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,122
but we've just lost 45 grand

897
00:53:07,181 --> 00:53:10,216
and we're still scratching our heads
trying to figure out how, and who.

898
00:53:11,224 --> 00:53:14,437
He's obviously a very talented grifter.

899
00:53:14,663 --> 00:53:16,474
No, no, no.
He's not a grifter.

900
00:53:16,974 --> 00:53:18,665
I mean, not a grifter
as we know it.

901
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:21,244
I mean, he's way too far
out of the box for that.

902
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:23,381
The saboku thing
and the fugu thing

903
00:53:23,977 --> 00:53:26,661
and the bizarre russian
roulette fish eating thing.

904
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:30,862
Yeah, wouldn't you just
love to do something like that, hey?

905
00:53:31,162 --> 00:53:32,214
It's inspiring, yes.

906
00:53:32,539 --> 00:53:33,795
Ooh! Makes me tingle.

907
00:53:35,164 --> 00:53:36,473
Well, I'm not tingling,

908
00:53:36,474 --> 00:53:39,262
but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this
if it's the last thing I do.

909
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:42,428
We need to do a surgical
postmortem on every move

910
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:45,005
we've made in
the last few days.

911
00:53:45,396 --> 00:53:48,817
If we look at this long enough,
hard enough, we'll see the crack.

912
00:53:49,213 --> 00:53:53,460
Okay, we start by each making
a detailed personal log.

913
00:53:53,585 --> 00:53:54,888
Guys, guys.

914
00:53:58,022 --> 00:54:01,112
The thing is,
and I'm not saying this is definite,

915
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,853
not by any stretch of the imagination,

916
00:54:06,005 --> 00:54:09,000
but there was a moment.

917
00:54:11,209 --> 00:54:15,021
Yeah, solid leadership
is the key to success.

918
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,283
By the close of play today, son,

919
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,060
we're gonna be 30 grand richer.

920
00:54:20,242 --> 00:54:21,677
I blabbed about the con.

921
00:54:22,413 --> 00:54:24,315
I botched up.
I got a big mouth.

922
00:54:24,475 --> 00:54:25,475
I'm an idiot.

923
00:54:25,538 --> 00:54:28,064
Yep, yep, yep.
All of these things are true.

924
00:54:28,616 --> 00:54:31,713
That's why we never
do the same con twice in a row.

925
00:54:32,054 --> 00:54:33,211
So it wasn't my fault.

926
00:54:33,367 --> 00:54:36,498
This happened because
we broke the rules.

927
00:54:36,678 --> 00:54:38,679
No.
It was your fault.

928
00:54:39,368 --> 00:54:40,478
Definitely.

929
00:54:40,479 --> 00:54:42,027
Without a shadow of a doubt.

930
00:54:47,977 --> 00:54:49,675
He's a creepy fat minger.

931
00:54:52,177 --> 00:54:54,784
Am I or am I not
a criminal genius?

932
00:54:55,474 --> 00:54:57,000
Don't get any
big ideas, sis.

933
00:54:57,165 --> 00:54:59,043
This is a one hit deal.
We agreed.

934
00:55:00,226 --> 00:55:01,699
We got more than enough now.

935
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,088
I'm a genius.

936
00:55:04,483 --> 00:55:07,498
I'm a genius.
<i>So, by tricking the valiant robbers,</i>

937
00:55:07,858 --> 00:55:09,963
<i>the clever girl
and her handsome brother</i>

938
00:55:10,046 --> 00:55:13,902
<i>earned their freedom from the
cruel landlord who had enslaved them.</i>

939
00:55:17,546 --> 00:55:20,457
<i>Her brother was not greedy,
sharing his treasure</i>

940
00:55:20,536 --> 00:55:23,120
<i>with those who still worked
for the nasty man.</i>

941
00:55:25,485 --> 00:55:29,823
<i>He had dreamt of becoming a samural
and slaying that evil master,</i>

942
00:55:31,235 --> 00:55:34,042
<i>but the little girl
had a much better plan.</i>

943
00:55:36,484 --> 00:55:37,747
Oh, Danny, I don't know.

944
00:55:38,171 --> 00:55:39,697
Maybe you'll learn something.

945
00:55:40,234 --> 00:55:44,106
Maybe making a really,
really bad, costly,

946
00:55:44,171 --> 00:55:47,717
expensive mistake might
actually teach you something.

947
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:49,803
Yeah, well, you know.

948
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:52,733
Guys, I should've been-
should've been watching your backs.

949
00:55:52,874 --> 00:55:57,098
I should've been there
for ya, and I wasn't and, uh, I'm sorry.

950
00:55:57,852 --> 00:56:00,140
Totally off the bowl,
a little bit cocky.

951
00:56:01,173 --> 00:56:02,173
And complacent.

952
00:56:02,547 --> 00:56:03,547
A little bit, yeah.

953
00:56:03,832 --> 00:56:05,732
- And arrogant.
- Maybe.

954
00:56:06,671 --> 00:56:08,818
And selfish,
conceited, slapdash,

955
00:56:09,014 --> 00:56:11,922
vain, careless, pigheaded...

956
00:56:12,266 --> 00:56:14,371
<i>The brother was very
proud of his sister</i>

957
00:56:14,527 --> 00:56:16,146
<i>and her criminal mastermind.</i>

958
00:56:17,077 --> 00:56:21,329
<i>The little girl had many more
clever plans, but her brother said, "no.</i>

959
00:56:21,641 --> 00:56:23,861
