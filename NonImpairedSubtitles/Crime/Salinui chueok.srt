4
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:14,725
Junk car!

5
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,179
Get out of here, kid.

6
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,000
I told you to get out of here.

7
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,627
Go home, kid.

8
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:16,957
Go home, kid.

9
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,928
Little brat.

10
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:20,055
Little brat.

11
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,497
What the hell are they doing?

12
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,332
What the hell are they doing?

13
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:25,829
Hey you!

14
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:26,098
Hey you!

15
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,737
Put that back!

16
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:27,898
Put that back!

17
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,810
Hey, leave it there. Go away.

18
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:35,812
Hey you!

19
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:35,938
Hey you!

20
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,279
That's important, don't touch!

21
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,716
That's important, don't touch!

22
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,014
Those kids.

23
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,249
Those kids.

24
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:25,926
MEMORIES OF MURDER

25
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,262
What?

26
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,393
You dated the dead girl, and
she dumped you last August?

27
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,436
Is that right?

28
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,271
That's correct.

29
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,141
That's correct? Take off
your hat, you damn punk.

30
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,841
Do women like guys like you?

31
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:52,153
After watching Body Heat...

32
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,125
Body Heat?
That an action movie?

33
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,296
A, c, t...

34
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,002
Damn punk...

35
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:11,600
...since it's a rape
and murder case and all...

36
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,942
well...

37
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:19,485
...if she was sexy,
or pretty, that sort of thing.

38
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,075
Your impressions?

39
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,915
Well,

40
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:27,390
she didn't seem
like a country girl...

41
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,690
Don't blink.

42
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,428
You blinked, didn't you?

43
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:37,025
Hey, look at me.

44
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,704
Don't look at the ceiling,
look at me!

45
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,204
Was he born that way?
One, two...

46
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,120
Didn't you want to go
to the Military Academy?

47
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,525
Did you take the exam?

48
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,530
You need to study hard
to get in there.

49
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,069
- Receipt!
- You didn't ask for one.

50
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,265
What? I told you to bring one.

51
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,707
- I told you.
- No you didn't.

52
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,142
That's what you said last time...

53
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,976
Here's one, here.

54
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:28,420
You answered the phone,
you lying bastard...

55
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:33,424
I need a receipt from the restaurant.
Not from a bicycle shop.

Directed by BONG Joon-Ho

57
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,364
Why didn't you rope
the place off?

58
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:50,067
At least get some sticks
to drive them in, morons.

59
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,303
Inspector Park, over here!

60
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,006
- What is this?
- It's a footprint.

61
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,443
- When did you find it?
- This morning, sir!

62
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,747
Go help those jerks over there.

63
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,913
You called the forensics team?

64
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,184
Yes, they're on their way.

65
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,990
But, where's the
person who reported this?

66
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:16,361
No forensics team,
this is total chaos!

67
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,403
Jesus, look at him!

68
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:20,934
Hey!

69
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,398
Get out of here!

70
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,744
Who received the call on this?

71
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,446
Did you find out
who reported it?

72
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,143
The phone... The crime
site is getting ruined.

73
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,618
Damn forensics team's
not here, this is a mess.

74
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,087
What are you talking about?

75
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:42,389
Take pictures when I tell you!

76
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,591
Why'd you bring
so many reporters?

77
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,929
They were all here when I arrived.

78
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,095
Reporter Park's not here.
Must be on vacation.

79
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,695
I don't see him.

80
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,273
Feels great with
that shithead gone.

81
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,775
Why does this have
to happen to me?

82
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,438
How can I investigate like this?

83
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,916
Hey, tractor!

84
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,486
Tractor!

85
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:13,548
Tractor, stay away! Detour!

86
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,931
If someone waves,
shouldn't you look?

87
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,829
Shit, is he deaf?

88
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,494
Shit! Look at this.

89
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,698
Now those bastards show up.

90
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,771
What the hell took you so long?

91
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,781
The crime scene's ruined!

92
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,819
Jesus, look at these sliding fools!

93
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,820
What's going on?

94
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,895
How can you look at
those photos while eating?

95
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,365
If I keep staring at them,

96
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,836
one moment it'll hit me.

97
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,031
Instinctively.

98
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,505
Are you a fortune teller?

99
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,703
Open up a shop then.

100
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:11,846
Chief, I may know nothing else,
but my eyes can read people.

101
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,014
It's how I survive as a detective.

102
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,319
There's a reason people
say I have shaman's eyes.

103
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,586
OK, then.

104
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,261
You see those two guys there?

105
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:31,634
One of them's a rapist, and the
other is the victim's brother.

106
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:41,373
He caught the guy doing this to
his sister, and dragged him in.

107
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:48,146
So tell me,
which one's the rapist?

108
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,192
- Hey.
- What?

109
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,666
I think it fell out.

110
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,168
Really?

111
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,364
Let's do this properly.

112
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,473
I'll give this to you
especially today.

113
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,606
I'm so grateful.

114
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,915
It's just a flu shot.

115
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,648
Know how much this costs?

116
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,958
- Kwak Sul-young?
- Yeah?

117
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:33,828
You must be earning more
now than at the hospital.

118
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,798
I hear everyone in
town comes to you.

119
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,998
Shh. I got something to tell you.

120
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,544
I heard this from the
old woman at the mill.

121
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:49,575
You know the Baek family
meat restaurant?

122
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,510
The Baek family?

123
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,509
You know what people call them?

124
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:56,912
What?

125
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,025
The Baek Lady Killers.

126
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,319
- Ladies?
- Yeah.

127
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,732
But the son's a little
bit retarded. Kwang-ho.

128
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:15,805
Kwang-ho used to follow
Hyang-sook around all the time.

129
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,877
Hyang-sook?
The one who was killed?

130
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,502
Yeah.

131
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,983
She was found with
a girdle over her head?

132
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,279
Right.

133
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,479
Even more important,

134
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,558
the night she was killed...

135
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:38,392
that old woman saw
Kwang-ho following her.

136
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,567
- Really?
- That's what I'm saying.

137
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:46,161
I heard that old hag
went senile last year.

138
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,899
No, she's fine.

139
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,742
That kid... Wait.

140
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,051
Kwang-ho? What's he look like?

141
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:05,881
This side of his face is a bit...
you know.

142
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:09,222
Tell me in detail.

143
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,796
Anyways, he's a poor little kid.

144
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,220
Kwang-ho.

145
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,718
Let's talk man to man.

146
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:44,694
You see a pretty girl,
you want to do her.

147
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:50,531
When I was your age, I'd go
out with friends, I understand.

148
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:56,700
You never intended to kill
Hyang-sook at first, huh?

149
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,710
"How about just
touching her breast..."

150
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:00,801
I couldn't touch it.

151
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,780
So you killed her?
Kill her, then you can touch it.

152
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,350
No, I didn't.

153
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,748
That guy coming down now,
he's had a hard life, like you.

154
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,883
He's nice.

155
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,394
He's really sweet.

156
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,794
He never beats anyone.

157
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,766
But sometimes,
you know,

158
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:26,099
if he gets worked up
about something...

159
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:33,734
God, what an ugly face.

160
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:38,783
Just looking at this face
makes me angry.

161
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,986
Shit.

162
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,457
Pretty?

163
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,835
This is so it won't
leave scratches, you punk.

164
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,235
Hey, hey...

165
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,939
What's with the army boots?

166
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,067
Doing this to the kid...

167
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,338
Kwang-ho, get up.

168
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,815
Are you really innocent? Huh?

169
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,319
Look in my eyes.

170
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,448
Where the hell's he looking?

171
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,220
Look in my eyes!

172
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,724
Excuse me, miss...

173
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,667
Hello?

174
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:07,771
Oh, miss?

175
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,636
Are you all right?

176
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,838
Why are you following me?

177
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,072
to ask directions.

178
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,273
Let me help you.

179
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,849
Let go!

180
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,216
What's wrong?

181
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:27,520
Rolling in the fields, huh?
Is this town rapist's paradise?

182
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:34,259
You shithead.

183
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:37,426
What the hell?

184
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,902
Who are you?

185
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,371
Get over here.

186
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,269
Hey miss, the victim
needs to file a report!

187
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,705
Miss!

188
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,791
Where is she going?

189
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,259
Are you a detective?

190
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,599
You should have told me.

191
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:10,862
My mistake.

192
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,206
How can a detective
be such a bad fighter?

193
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,071
How can a detective have
such a bad eye for criminals?

194
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,149
What's that smell?

195
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,978
Oh, sneakers.

196
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,449
They smell bad?

197
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:36,256
But these here are
evidence item 28.

198
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,278
Develop these quickly, huh?

199
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,724
- Uh, chief.
- What?

200
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,385
This guy here... from Seoul.

201
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:15,092
Nice to meet you!
I got the call...

202
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,895
But...

203
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,095
your face...

204
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,139
Did anything happen?

205
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,141
- No, nothing.
- A desk, you need...

206
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,940
Oh, I prepared a desk
over there with lots of sunlight.

207
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,013
I think... I like that corner.

208
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,049
Okay, okay! As you wish.

209
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,849
Inspector Jo, say hello.

210
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,987
From Seoul,

211
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,861
Suh Tae-... yoon, senior officer.

212
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,161
Jo Yong-gu. Nice to meet you.

213
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,437
He volunteered to assist
with this investigation.

214
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,330
Quite an uncommon thing.

215
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,878
Well, go arrange your desk.

216
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,377
Yes, sit down.

217
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,381
Inspector Chief

218
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,065
The song is great.
The opening song.

219
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,861
I always watch
lnspector Chief with Dad.

220
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,095
What was my phone number?

221
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,405
Just eat.

222
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,599
Right, I need to call Dad!

223
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,109
I should call. Oh, it's Dad!

224
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,188
Hey, Kwang-ho.

225
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,016
Listen.

226
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:52,154
This footprint was found at the
site of Hyang-sook's murder.

227
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,288
Look.

228
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,861
And these are sneakers
we found at your house.

229
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,937
You wear these? Right?

230
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,767
Now, look closely.

231
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:07,676
The footprint in this photo,
and the sole of your shoe.

232
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,607
The same, right?

233
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,808
This pattern?

234
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:17,253
The circle, this indentation?
Exactly the same.

235
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,085
Am I right?

236
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,259
This part was smudged,

237
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,295
don't worry about that.

238
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,933
You killed all
those women, right?

239
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,004
Okay.

240
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,807
You didn't kill them all, right?

241
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:44,412
So you didn't not kill only
Hyang-sook, correct?

242
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,616
I didn't kill anyone.

243
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,519
We've got the
evidence here!

244
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:55,184
- Where's our shovel?
- Shovel?

245
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,097
Look at you...

246
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,725
Hey, bastard. Give me that.

247
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,862
Can't you even shovel right?
Watch me.

248
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,204
Loosen the dirt first.
Then push with your foot.

249
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,141
- Kwang-ho!
- Yes?

250
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:17,181
You punk.

251
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:21,241
Did you come here to play?

252
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,786
You know where this is?

253
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,545
We came here to bury you.

254
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:28,615
What? Why?
Why?

255
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,991
Because you won't
listen, you bastard.

256
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:34,361
- I'm a good boy.
- Then tell me!

257
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,464
Out here in the fresh air.
With that face.

258
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,231
Hey, come here.

259
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:44,173
Women hate this
face, don't they?

260
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,676
They grimace and all
fucking run away.

261
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,439
It's true.

262
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,344
I'll kill them all.

263
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:57,247
Everyone who
grimaces at my face.

264
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,221
I'll kill them all.

265
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:05,726
Those women who grimace,
they're all in my head.

266
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,293
- Hyang-sook too?
- Hyang-sook?

267
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,269
Hyang-sook. You always
followed her around.

268
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,773
- Hyang-sook is pretty.
- Oh yeah, she's pretty.

269
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,072
But Hyang-sook
grimaced too, huh?

270
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,009
She said, "Fuck, get away!"
didn't she?

271
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,878
Because you liked her.

272
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,610
So you killed her, huh?

273
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,058
By the train tracks.

274
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,891
In that rice paddy.

275
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,557
The train tracks? Right.

276
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:45,364
Her throat. Hyang-sook's throat...

277
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,962
..strangled it tightly.

278
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,508
- With what?
- Her brassiere.

279
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,171
With her white brassiere,

280
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,807
strangled her tightly.

281
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,544
- And then?
- Her stocking.

282
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,519
- Her stocking?
- Pulled off her leg.

283
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,055
Then it was the stocking.

284
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,615
This guy's smart, huh?

285
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:09,785
And then?

286
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,795
What?

287
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,866
What was it?

288
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,594
Something with a strap?

289
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,402
A handbag strap?

290
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,801
Right, a bag strap.

291
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:29,245
Strangling Hyang-sook's
throat with it tightly.

292
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:31,672
And?

293
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:38,455
Then, Hyang-sook's
body shook a bit.

294
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,787
She looked completely dead.

295
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,092
And then?

296
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:49,323
Her head was covered up.

297
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,765
With what?

298
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:58,799
Her panties. Covered her
head with her panties.

299
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,345
Do you mean a girdle?
That women wear?

300
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,506
Right, girdle!

301
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:09,952
Looked like it covered
her head right up.

302
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,988
And then?

303
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,984
Um... had to dress her again.

304
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,994
And why was that?

305
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,828
I don't know.
Put the clothes back on.

306
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,798
Why was that?

307
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,604
How would I know?

308
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,267
You were doing well!

309
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,641
Bastard! What did you do next?

310
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,111
- Then... running!
- Where?

311
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,148
- It was raining!
- Where did you run?

312
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,209
- Kept running.
- Oh, you little shit!

313
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,754
The lightning struck!

314
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,256
Where the hell were you
running, you bastard!

315
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,021
Yong-gu, start digging.

316
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,755
Huh? Digging?

317
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,455
Lightning!

318
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,419
Citizens, this is a
civil defence drill.

319
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,390
The air raid siren
has begun to sound.

320
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,927
This is only a drill.

321
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:28,557
The entire country is now
under a civil defence drill.

322
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:36,369
A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses.

323
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:41,208
Follow the instructions
you hear in this broadcast.

324
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:47,650
Please move all flammable
materials to a safe place.

325
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:53,019
Unplug all cords, then hurry
to an underground area...

326
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,561
Shut off the lights!

327
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,910
Hey, you!

328
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,920
Come here.

329
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,291
Put this on.
Everyone ready?

330
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,987
Get in the car.

331
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,688
Turn around.

332
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,197
"Lee Hyang-sook"

333
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,461
Take off your pants.

334
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:40,729
What'll the headline be?

335
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,297
"Crime-Fighting Trio" or
"Smiles of the Unstoppable."

336
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,434
Inspector Park, in the back.

337
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,480
Make a straight line now.

338
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,681
Miss Kwon, big party tonight!
Reserve a room.

339
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,150
Smile!

340
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:59,580
This time, hold up your fist.
Tight!

341
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:04,628
- Come take a picture!
- That's okay.

342
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,560
Come on!

343
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,863
Wait a second.

344
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,213
With these webbed fingers,

345
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,580
you can't even hold
chopsticks, right?

346
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,677
They've always been this way?
Go on.

347
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,857
Kwang-ho, this is the spot, right?

348
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:41,898
I don't know.

349
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,696
What's he talking about?
It was here.

350
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:49,163
For the re-enactment,
you have to act well.

351
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,107
There are a lot of reporters here.

352
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,178
How's this?

353
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,803
A bit lower.

354
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,412
- What do we start with?
- Wait.

355
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:03,681
It's best to write down
the correct order.

356
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,382
Then why didn't you do it?
I'm fucking busy.

357
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:07,690
Chief.

358
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:12,620
The re-enactment
isn't going to work anyway.

359
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,791
becomes an embarrassment.

360
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,564
Hey, I told you to stay away.
Why'd you come back here?

361
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,664
Just give them some excuse.
The suspect is sick, or...

362
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,242
Inspector Suh!

363
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:29,342
You're dumping shit
on cooked rice here!

364
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:32,575
I told you before,
Kwang-ho isn't guilty.

365
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,151
Just shut up!

366
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,885
Chief...

367
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:40,424
The cords around their necks
were tied with three tight knots.

368
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,790
Look at Kwang-ho's hands.
Could he do that?

369
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,726
- Get out!
- Even a child can see that.

370
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,491
Get the hell out!

371
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:51,164
Grab the brassiere strap...

372
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,793
Hey, concentrate!

373
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,270
Dad!

374
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,635
Kwang-ho! It's me!

375
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:59,369
Dad!

376
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:03,243
Hey, you're innocent!

377
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:09,118
I know! I didn't do it!

378
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:23,766
Mr. Baek Kwang-ho!
Are you denying a crime?

379
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,065
He didn't kill anyone!
My son's innocent!

380
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:32,576
You were tortured, weren't you?

381
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:33,837
My team never tortures suspects.

382
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,311
It's all gone to hell.

383
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,816
Don't bring it up.

384
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:46,789
Hey, did you see the look on
prosecutor Choi's face back there?

385
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,258
Fuck, how can he
revoke the warrant?

386
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:51,927
We even had evidence.

387
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,056
Evidence? That footprint?

388
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,601
How can they set him free?

389
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,104
What can we do?

390
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,404
All we had was a confession.

391
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,469
It was no ordinary confession.
You heard the tape.

392
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:14,644
All the details of the crime
came pouring out his mouth.

393
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,883
Things he'd never know
if he weren't the killer.

394
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,618
Like how she was strangled.

395
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,494
You heard it too.

396
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,759
Be honest, didn't you
rehearse that in advance?

397
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:28,958
What?

398
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,035
Quiet. Eat something.

399
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,070
Jesus...

400
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:42,680
What? I said to separate
the noodles and bean sauce.

401
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,949
What the fuck!

402
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,148
Investigative Team Reshuffled

403
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:55,920
Murder Case Shrouded
In Mystery Once Again

404
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:17,670
The location of
the first homicide,

405
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,875
and the second homicide.

406
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:24,444
Now, a distance of...

407
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:25,955
approximately 1000 meters.

408
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:29,652
A length of not more
than... one kilometer.

409
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:43,306
The victim, on the
12th and the 16th,

410
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:48,107
both days at twelve o'clock...

411
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:51,649
Ah, December 16th.

412
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,580
On December 16th,

413
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,279
at twelve o'clock,

414
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,552
Location:Yangji Teahouse,

415
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:03,525
Han Sung-geun

416
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:07,223
a 32-year old office worker.

417
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:12,368
An arranged date, maybe?

418
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,804
Anyway, at the crime site

419
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:21,470
...were found a footprint,
two drops of blood,

420
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:25,845
...and a drop of semen.
Semen? They found semen?

421
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,941
What? Yes.

422
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,616
The two dead women...

423
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,057
Did they have
anything in common?

424
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,754
In common...

425
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,729
Well, first...

426
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:45,860
Both of them were single.

427
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,337
They were both
extremely beautiful.

428
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,669
And?

429
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,714
The murders all
took place in the rain.

430
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,076
Rain?

431
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,877
He murdered them
on rainy nights.

432
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,319
Really?

433
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,484
And red clothes.

434
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,320
They all wore red clothes.

435
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,451
Both of them?

436
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,325
No, all three of them.

437
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:15,595
Three of them?

438
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,167
What are you talking about?

439
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,931
Three were murdered.
We just haven't found the third body.

440
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:28,375
This is a missing person form.
The name is quite unusual.

441
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:32,506
Dokko Hyun-soon, age 27.
It was two months ago, October 18.

442
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,644
Oh, her? Dokko Hyun-soon?
I know that girl.

443
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:40,190
Everyone in this town knows her.

444
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,158
A pretty girl,
that Hyun-soon.

445
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,788
Even a Miss Korea
is no match for her.

446
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:50,262
Did you process the missing
person form, Yong-gu?

447
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:51,801
Oh, shut up.

448
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,066
This is no ordinary incident, Chief.

449
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:59,007
If you look in detail.
Documents never lie.

450
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,137
It says she was
wearing a red shirt.

451
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,112
It's right here in writing.

452
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,643
What's that?

453
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:11,148
Marked here is the weather
on the day she vanished.

454
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,553
It rained on that day too.

455
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,955
Rain, red clothes...

456
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,895
She was murdered.
By the same person.

457
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,696
You don't know this town,
that's why you talk nonsense.

458
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:29,136
She always said she'd
go to Seoul one day...

459
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,504
I have an idea where the body is.

460
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,042
Look at the map.

461
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:37,075
Right here...

462
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,639
I marked where the victim went,
and where the body might be.

463
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:47,018
Give me two squadrons of
cops. I'll find her in two days.

464
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,325
You sure of this?

465
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,375
You know...

466
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:16,317
...university students,
when they go on orientation...

467
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:19,219
people say they
guys all get laid,

468
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:24,317
a big group, guys and girls,
in one room going at it...

469
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,226
Is that true?

470
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,855
I don't know. Hurry up.

471
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,637
You went to a 2-year
school, didn't you?

472
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:38,198
Student trips, orientation...
Did you go on those?

473
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:44,003
Go ask Suh, he went
to a 4-year university.

474
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,776
Whether he had group sex...

475
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:49,148
Shit, four years.

476
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,112
I spent 4 years in high school.

477
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:58,353
Shit, put that away.

478
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:05,335
You know, I miss
Dokko Hyun-soon.

479
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,403
You too?

480
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:11,307
She was just
too good for this town.

481
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,635
I'm telling you, she
went to Seoul.

482
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,615
What is it?

483
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,380
Lot of snakes down there.

484
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:30,025
Each part of a corpse
decays at a different speed.

485
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,153
Look. It's old,

486
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:35,289
but the inner thigh is still firm.

487
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,031
There's evidence of rape?

488
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,165
A bit of semen was found.

489
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:44,907
But it's so old, we can't
determine the blood type.

490
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,341
Oh, Hyun-soon...

491
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:51,874
This time too he used
items belonging to her.

492
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,077
Right, that's her stocking
around the throat?

493
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,346
Yes.

494
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,589
The victim's panties
on her face,

495
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,817
as with Hyang-sook.

496
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,326
Her hands were bound
the same way too.

497
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:09,161
His methods of killing
are quite professional.

498
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,502
He's thorough.

499
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,297
And polished.

500
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:21,308
So there hasn't been
a single witness yet.

501
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,416
Would you like
a bit more tenderloin?

502
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,951
That's okay. We're fine.

503
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:32,454
Where did Kwang-ho go?
I don't see him.

504
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:35,492
Is anything...?

505
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:40,030
I bought your son something,
give it to him later.

506
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,689
What's this?

507
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:45,599
Oh, last time, taking a
look at his sneakers,

508
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,934
they smelled so awful,
I felt bad for him.

509
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,771
I thought, I'll have to buy
him new shoes.

510
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,674
So I picked up some Nikes.

511
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,077
You didn't have to...

512
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:01,248
That punk, he's always sleeping
in the strangest places!

513
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:05,784
Kwang-ho!

514
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:10,122
This here...
your shoe size is 250mm, right?

515
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,924
Here, Nike. Try them on.

516
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:17,293
Give me that sneaker.

517
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:21,531
These are "Nice", not Nike.
N, l, C, E.

518
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:25,040
Nice or Nike. Who cares?

519
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:31,308
If you buy him sneakers,
you should get the real thing.

520
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,383
Cool, huh?

521
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,278
Have a drink.

522
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:43,026
I beat you because
I care for you.

523
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:47,063
So if you see me on the
street, don't run away.

524
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:51,931
Yong-gu feels bad about--

525
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:53,804
Punk.

526
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,310
Hey, where are you going again?

527
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,344
You see, Chief.

528
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:10,148
That boy is the exact opposite
of the type we're looking for.

529
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:14,418
Dragging in suspects like that
is a waste of time, so...

530
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:15,355
Inspector Suh!

531
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,791
Have some meat
before you speak.

532
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,661
I don't eat burnt meat.

533
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,932
& When the Spring flower blooms &

534
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:34,034
& You said you'd come back to me &

535
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:40,414
& Like the singing swallows &

536
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:47,718
& On the hills, singing birds and blooming flowers &

537
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:53,526
... & Alone on the hill &

538
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:58,397
Sir?

539
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,269
Hey, Seoul city bumpkin.

540
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:13,578
What?

541
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,386
Why did you come here?

542
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:20,583
Out to the boondocks?

543
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,484
To catch the killer.

544
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,934
Is Seoul that big?

545
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,468
Huh? Is it big?

546
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,341
Bigger than America?

547
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:43,477
Give me a banana.

548
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,953
Let me tell you about America.

549
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,816
They've got the F.B.I.!

550
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:58,024
If you watch how they
investigate... You know how?

551
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,699
Their heads are
spinning like a top.

552
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,893
Analyzing things...

553
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,097
You know why?

554
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:13,766
It's 'cause they got so
much fucking land!

555
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:21,377
If you don't use your brain,
it's too much ground to cover.

556
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:26,320
So they have no choice,
those F.B.I. bastards.

557
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:31,260
But our Republic of Korea...

558
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:37,098
using just your two legs,
you can run all over it.

559
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,634
You know why?

560
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,030
'Cause our land's
the size of my dick.

561
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:49,045
So it's said, Korean detectives
investigate with their feet.

562
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:53,242
That's folk wisdom,
you bastard.

563
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,911
So brainy geeks like you
can go the hell to America.

564
00:40:57,021 --> 00:41:00,650
- Go there and...
- Shut your fucking mouth!

565
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,825
You bastard!

566
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,460
- Let go of me!
- What? You f...

567
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:18,742
Give him this.

568
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,513
Take it away! Take it!

569
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,992
Everything's clearer now.
That's much better.

570
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:44,425
I've got it now.
About the killer.

571
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,129
That bastard,

572
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:50,207
he'll do it again.

573
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,935
The next night it rains.

574
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:57,810
So we need to keep
one step ahead of him.

575
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:01,180
Pre-emptive!
Okay?

576
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:07,549
And if you two ever start
fighting in front of me again,

577
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:11,150
I'll kill you both! Understood?

578
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,043
Ladies and gentlemen!

579
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,134
In just a moment,

580
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,339
our President will be

581
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:34,008
driving past. Wait a minute...

582
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,630
It's raining nice.

583
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,570
You ready?

584
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:38,447
Ooh, Gui-ok's looking nice!

585
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:39,538
Shut up.

586
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,313
What if he grabs her for real?

587
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:51,383
Inspector Suh should be
following close behind her.

588
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:57,957
Shit, do we have to do
this every time when it rains?

589
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:00,297
But thanks to this,

590
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,804
Gui-ok puts on that red skirt.

591
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:06,774
With makeup, she looks
like a different person.

592
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,773
- So what?
- Was she always that pretty?

593
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,005
You getting hard?

594
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,082
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Let's check.

595
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,412
- We're on duty now...
- Oh, Yong-gu!

596
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:24,390
Hey.

597
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,225
So do you really
keep watch here?

598
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,533
These days, nobody
ever goes outside.

599
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:34,966
Someone's coming.

600
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:38,873
Hey, kids!

601
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:41,408
Over here.

602
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,479
That's cold.

603
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:47,914
You're so wet!

604
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:55,024
Hey, stay here
until the rain stops.

605
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,119
That umbrella's useless.

606
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,195
And we just picked it up
in front of the school.

607
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,821
Someone threw it away.

608
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,625
Miss, are you going
that way too?

609
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,396
Hey, she's a detective.

610
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,266
No way!

611
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,670
She's in the
Violent Crimes Division.

612
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:12,742
- Really?
- Sure.

613
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,209
Wait a minute.
We'll give you a ride.

614
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,507
Wow, in a police car!

615
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:22,608
Hey, you two. What are
you doing out so late?

616
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,915
We always stay together,
so it's okay.

617
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:28,651
You'll be fine
even if you go alone.

618
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:35,293
Nam-ju, tell them about
what you heard at school.

619
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,423
What?

620
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:39,093
You know, during cleaning
time, about the murderer.

621
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:43,299
Right! You know why they
can't catch the murderer?

622
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,399
This is the truth. We go to
Ansong Girls Middle School.

623
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,341
Behind our school,
there's an outhouse.

624
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:52,472
They say a crazy man lives
under there, the murderer!

625
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,016
He stays there all day,

626
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:57,178
and when night comes,
he sneaks out and kills women.

627
00:45:57,287 --> 00:46:00,984
So when he comes out at night,

628
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,549
you must be able to smell
the shit from miles away.

629
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:07,721
That's not the story.

630
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:11,267
Yoo-jin said a crazy woman
fell in there and died.

631
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:15,767
Then I'll meet you in front of
the factory with an umbrella.

632
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:19,468
It's okay.

633
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:21,100
Okay.

634
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:24,840
I'll see you soon.

635
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:41,390
& Stand by me,
don't leave me. &

636
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:47,494
& I still love you.
Walking by myself... &

637
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,073
Hello?

638
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:48,090
Everyone stay where you are!

639
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:52,821
Don't touch anything near you.
Don't move one step!

640
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,454
Hey, you!

641
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:55,792
I'm talking to you!

642
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:58,299
Wait for the forensics team.

643
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:12,105
Look!

644
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:14,683
These are genuine footprints.

645
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:19,313
You see the
Remicon factory there?

646
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:23,416
He caught her near the factory,

647
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:27,588
and quietly pulled her
over 400 meters to here.

648
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,827
The footprints look
like a bride and groom's.

649
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:41,276
But you didn't find anything,
aside from the footprints?

650
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:45,781
I hoped to find fingerprints on
the umbrella, but no luck.

651
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:49,208
Not only that, due to the rain,

652
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,549
the footprints are all smudged.

653
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:57,292
Even after such a thorough
investigation, nothing.

654
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:05,063
Therefore, Chief, I think
this could be a hint. Hint!

655
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,692
What?

656
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:11,831
The fact that we found
nothing at the scene.

657
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,604
Always in rape cases,

658
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:18,442
at the crime scene,

659
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:23,178
there's one or two of
those hairs left behind.

660
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:24,810
So?

661
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:31,049
I'm saying the criminal must not
have any hair down there.

662
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,924
You mean hairless?

663
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:37,364
That's right, hairless.
A total baldie.

664
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:44,407
He can't leave hair behind,
because he doesn't have any?

665
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,135
For example,

666
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:50,373
a Buddhist monk who
shaved the hair down there.

667
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,448
It's a perfect crime.

668
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,540
Well, then.

669
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:58,553
Yongdeok Temple
is just next door.

670
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:00,179
Should we start there?

671
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:11,800
Hey Gui-ok, you've got
the radio on over there.

672
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,468
How would you like your coffee?

673
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,598
Lots of sugar for me.

674
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,870
- lnspector Suh!
- Yes, sir?

675
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:25,744
Do you have any more ideas?

676
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,780
I don't know.
As you saw today,

677
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,285
this criminal is flawless.

678
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:33,322
- So?
- Therefore,

679
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,984
our standard procedures
aren't going to help.

680
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:40,029
So what are we going to do?

681
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,633
Excuse me, but I've
got something to show you.

682
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,837
What will she show us today?

683
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:56,768
What's this?

684
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,416
These are documents
from an FM radio station.

685
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:03,418
Looks like a
broadcast schedule.

686
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,923
Yes, it's an evening music
program I listen to.

687
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:13,189
There's someone who keeps
requesting the song, "Sad Letter".

688
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:16,498
If you look, it lists the dates
this song was broadcast.

689
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:21,768
Actually, this isn't a very
popular song. It's quite rare.

690
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,430
A song? What letter?

691
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,203
"Sad Letter"
The singer is Yu Jae-ha.

692
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:29,877
Jo Young-pil's band.

693
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,448
- Sure, I heard it.
- So?

694
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:40,183
The song was broadcast on the
same days of the murders here.

695
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:43,693
Look.

696
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,356
October 20.
That's Park Bo-hee's murder.

697
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:53,062
December 19
was Lee Hyang-sook.

698
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,629
So...

699
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:59,107
...on last night's murder too,
this song was broadcast?

700
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:02,838
Yes. I listened to it myself.

701
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:07,479
containing the request.

702
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:11,179
"Sent by a lonely man
from Terung District."

703
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,518
"Please broadcast it
on a rainy day."

704
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:19,991
Miss Kwon, nice! Good idea!

705
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:23,663
You read too many mystery
novels as a student?

706
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:26,768
That was a nice story.

707
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,132
Chief, this can't
be a coincidence.

708
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,106
Look at this.
Documents never lie.

709
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,111
Christ, here we go again.

710
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:40,047
It seems he's a real psycho.

711
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:44,052
As soon as he hears the song,
he goes crazy.

712
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:47,453
Oh Chief, now you're doing
it too. This makes no sense!

713
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,219
It does make sense, sir!
It's quite simple.

714
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:54,923
Assemblies start with the
National Anthem. It's the same.

715
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:56,692
Did you get the postcard?

716
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,530
I requested it,

717
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:02,264
but the radio station's
a bit disorganized.

718
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:07,409
Find it quickly.
Check the postmark,

719
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,875
fingerprints and handwriting.

720
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,037
Yes, sir!

721
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:14,247
Officer Kwon, call the station
and follow up on this.

722
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:21,317
Baldies!

723
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:24,492
- What about that?
- Huh?

724
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,687
What we mentioned before...

725
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,559
Hairless, sir!

726
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,496
How do you investigate?

727
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,626
Pull the pants off passing men?

728
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:50,880
The postcard from yesterday.
I asked you to keep it!

729
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:52,784
What postcard?

730
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:57,223
You read it on the air yesterday!
Look how many we get here!

731
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:00,588
Hey, mister!

732
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,897
Nothing. Get dressed.

733
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:07,300
Inspector.

734
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:10,771
They've already
carted off yesterday's trash.

735
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:13,035
It's no use.

736
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,751
You're not going to shower?

737
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:35,259
Enough showers, for god's sake.

738
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:39,131
My skin feels like it'll burst.

739
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:42,033
You couldn't find
any hairless men?

740
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:48,835
Like looking for dog's horns.
Just paid sauna fees.

741
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:51,311
Shit, can't even get reimbursed.

742
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,182
At least your face is clean.

743
00:55:57,287 --> 00:56:00,450
How many times in a day...
dressing, undressing, dressing...

744
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,115
I'll lose my hair there too.

745
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:10,861
I asked the workers
at the sauna there,

746
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:13,026
to call me if they saw anyone,

747
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:18,768
Bastards just smirked at me.

748
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:24,302
Don't do it all yourself,
have someone else do it.

749
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:31,352
What's that guy from Seoul
doing these days?

750
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:37,023
- Researching pop songs.
- What?

751
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:40,488
Shit, it's nothing
you've heard of.

752
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:43,196
Is he still talking nonsense?

753
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,628
Driving me crazy.

754
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:52,203
If you feel that way,
go see a shaman.

755
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:53,607
A shaman?

756
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:57,836
Sure, one that
tells fortunes well.

757
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:02,579
Ask her where the
murderer is hiding.

758
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:12,691
A problem at the main gate
of the police station.

759
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:17,992
It should be moved about
10m to the southwest.

760
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:24,732
A face just passed by me.
I think he's the one.

761
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:35,809
Is his face among
these pictures here?

762
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,449
Take those dirty photos away.

763
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,691
- Hey, just look...
- Put them away!

764
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,256
It's bad fortune.

765
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:54,460
- Take this, and do what I say.
- Don't try to sell that charm.

766
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,791
Wait, wait a minute.

767
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:22,525
You have to mix in dirt
from the crime scene.

768
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:24,355
Stir.

769
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,860
She said that
was most important.

770
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,097
Now pour it.

771
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:36,439
Stop.

772
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,112
Good.

773
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,791
Once this dries,

774
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:54,921
this stain will form the
shape of the murderer's face.

775
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,726
That's ridiculous.

776
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,892
Quiet, you'll break the charm.

777
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:00,629
Know how much this costs?

778
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:03,032
So shut up!

779
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:10,938
Who's that?

780
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:14,813
Don't you know?

781
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,878
Criminals always return
to the crime scene.

782
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:53,416
Wait a sec.

783
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,123
What's he doing here?

784
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:00,923
Why'd he come?

785
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:19,640
What the fuck...

786
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:24,652
We need science here!

787
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:26,512
What the hell's that?

788
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:35,461
Still, he's got style.
