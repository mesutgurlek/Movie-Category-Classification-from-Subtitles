1
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,581
<i>Hey, I've been doing some homework</i>

2
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,743
<i>on this kid Tobey Marshall
from Mount Kisco.</i>

3
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,117
<i>This kid was a phenom.
Used to tear up the local circuits.</i>

4
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,453
<i>Him and his dad, man,
they campaigned like champions.</i>

5
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,925
<i>Ofcourse, Mount Kisco
had another great, Dino Brewster.</i>

6
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,120
<i>You all know Dino.</i>

7
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,787
<i>He went on to race
in the big leagues at Indy</i>

8
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:29,060
<i>and Tobey just kind of
fell through the cracks.</i>

9
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,363
<i>Well, here's some news' cretins.</i>

10
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,372
<i>Tobey's been running again,
and running fast,.</i>

11
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:38,103
<i>Real fast, fast as
that "Grim Taquito" will take him.</i>

12
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:41,771
<i>Tobey, you wanna fly with the eagles,</i>

13
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,745
<i>you need bigger wings, son.</i>

14
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,147
<i>I'm just telling you right now</i>

15
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:49,448
<i>that if Tobey Marshall
ever got a car worthy of his talents,</i>

16
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,456
<i>he could be toeing the line at De Leon.</i>

17
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,086
Give me four clicks of compression.

18
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,560
All right.

19
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,058
Actually, make it three.

20
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,161
No, two. Two is perfect.

21
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,103
You wanna make up your mind?
What is it, two, three, or four'?

22
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,766
- Exactly.
- Yo, guys!

23
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,071
You know I'm gonna hurt you, right?

24
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,509
- Two.
- Thank you.

25
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,978
Guys. Joe, you gotta
check this out, man.

26
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,742
- Yo.
- Monarch's on fire.

27
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,141
<i>Cretin, go ahead.</i>

28
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,150
<i>Monarch, this is Darrel
from East Orange.</i>

29
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,915
<i>Why would you let</i> a <i>redneck
trust fund baby into the De Leon?</i>

30
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,321
<i>He doesn't deserve to</i> be
<i>in a winner-takes-all</i> race

31
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,017
<i>with multi-million-dollar cars!</i>

32
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,236
- Come on, Monarch!
- Caller?

33
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,094
Do I get to talk?

34
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,697
Darrel, have your parents
ever smacked you upside the head?

35
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,665
See, this is a case where sometimes
you just need to beat kids.

36
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,136
Darrel, Darrel, it's my show. I get...

37
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,831
Shut up! Listen to me!

38
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,305
Darrel, one important question.

39
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,502
Have you ever even driven a race car?

40
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,169
That's what I thought.

41
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,780
Let me explain to all
of you people out there

42
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,508
how this works one more time.

43
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,377
It's my race.

44
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,283
It's the De Leon. I created it.

45
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:00,015
It's rarefied air, kids. It's beautiful.

46
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,558
I decide who gets in,

47
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,219
and who does not
get in to the race, okay?

48
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,295
I loved your dad.

49
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:09,627
He was a customer of
the bank for 30 years.

50
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,996
Thirty.

51
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,203
What y'all talking about?

52
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,333
<i>The Flyin' Hawaiian just took down
Steve Heavy Chevy</i>

53
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,703
<i>- in the Arizona desert.
- What?</i>

54
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:26,883
<i>Man invitation as</i> a <i>wild card.
Okay? That's important.</i>

55
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,714
<i>Wild card. Maybe.</i>

56
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,551
<i>I'm not saying he's in,
I'm saying he might be.</i>

57
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,182
Who was that?

58
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,489
He's just an old customer of my dads.

59
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,854
I didn't recognize him.

60
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,764
Yeah, he might bring
his car in on Friday.

61
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:45,335
What's wrong with it?

62
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,869
Our job to find out.

63
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,739
I was thinking about the race tonight.
We should get there early.

64
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,709
Five cars, the race is full.
Pot should be, like, what?

65
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,211
Five grand.

66
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,894
- Tobey.
- Pete.

67
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,965
- You good?
- Good.

68
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,505
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

69
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,336
You know,
Monarch gave you a shout-out.

70
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,069
- Then he shit on your car.
- Yeah, I know. I heard.

71
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,235
Never mind that.

72
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,646
While Monarch was talking about you,
I had a vision.

73
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,072
All right, here we go.

74
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,483
Quiet, okay?
I happen to like his visions.

75
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:09,610
Pete, proceed, please.

76
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,683
I see water, and the sun, and...

77
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,088
- Your sister in a bikini.
- Shut it.

78
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,025
I see Tobey looking at a lighthouse.

79
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,924
I see you,
and you're gonna win De Leon.

80
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,093
- Really?
- Hey.

81
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,966
Thanks for the vote
of confidence, Pete,

82
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:27,334
but I got my hands full

83
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:31,603
trying to beat Jimmy Macintosh
and you tonight, so...

84
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,610
Oh, man.

85
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,344
My sister and Dino are here.

86
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,783
She didn't tell me
she was coming home, Tobe.

87
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,548
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,184
No, it's fine.

89
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,720
Coming with Dino isn't.

90
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,861
What's this fool
even doing back here, man?

91
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,225
Maybe he just came to watch
how a real racer drives.

92
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,165
The guy raced Indy.

93
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,298
It doesn't get more real than that, Finn.

94
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,710
Let's go, Tobey.
You don't need that distraction.

95
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:08,973
No, it's fine.

96
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,037
All right, boys,
the race is gonna start soon.

97
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,810
Ben, you should head up.

98
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,817
I just wanna let
you know I'm going because I want to

99
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,512
and not because you told me to.

100
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,247
- Just know that.
- Okay.

101
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,823
Way to put your foot down, Benny.

102
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,394
Nice pleather jacket, homie.

103
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,360
- Hey.
- Hi, guys. Hi, Petey.

104
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,488
How are you?

105
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,032
- I'm good. How are you?
- Good.

106
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:30,534
- Are you racing tonight?
- Yeah.

107
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,192
- You be careful.
- Okay.

108
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,531
<i>Okay.</i>

109
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,239
Hi, Tobey.

110
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,108
Anita.

111
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,115
I'm really sorry to hear about your dad.

112
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,183
Did you get my flowers?

113
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,856
Yeah.

114
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,519
Good.

115
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,230
And thank you for watching out for Pete.

116
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,192
He's like a little brother to me.

117
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,196
How's the shop?

118
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,538
The shop is... It's good.

119
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,630
It's good.

120
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,067
Yeah?

121
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,474
How's the city?

122
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,748
It's different than I expected,

123
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,616
but it's not here.

124
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,326
Are you still allergic to Mount Kisco?

125
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,625
Actually, Dino has something
he wants to talk to you about.

126
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,960
I doubt that.

127
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,002
After the race, though.
I don't wanna distract you.

128
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,136
Then you should have
stayed in Manhattan.

129
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,076
You look beautiful.

130
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,021
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

131
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,758
<i>Have you got the roads looked dawn?</i>

132
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,121
The road is clear.

133
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,923
We are at the finish line
and Benny is in the Cessna.

134
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,365
<i>Liar One, you standing by?</i>

135
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,093
<i>Here we go with this again.</i>

136
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,328
I wouldn't have to use that handle

137
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,707
if you stopped telling people you
flew Apache helicopters.

138
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,605
I took an Apache for a Joyride, okay?

139
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,768
That's all I said.

140
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,093
I know that's what you said.
We just don't believe you.

141
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,705
Hey, man, look,
just because I'm a crew chief

142
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,282
doesn't mean I don't know how to fly.

143
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,441
You gotta have balls
of titanium alloy to do what I do.

144
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,555
<i>So I need a little respect.
A little R-E-S-P-E-C-T.</i>

145
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,221
All right, enough messing around.
What's the status,

146
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,792
Liar One?

147
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,223
<i>Clear, and this is "Maverick."</i>

148
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,327
Call me Maverick,

149
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,730
or I will kamikaze this
into your nut sack.

150
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,750
Mind if I watch?

151
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,149
<i>Okay, gentlemen, please be advised,</i>

152
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,778
<i>I got traffic ahead.</i>

153
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,820
Repeat' I got traffic ahead.

154
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,340
That was close. He got lucky.

155
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,441
It's not luck. He's patient.

156
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,365
Sorry, little buddy.

157
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,565
My house!

158
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:19,899
Benny!

159
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,079
You bodied that guy's grocery cart.

160
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,078
What's wrong with you?

161
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,431
Yeah!

162
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,626
Yeah!

163
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,799
Sweet!

164
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,335
<i>Hey, yo, Father Joseph,
make sure you save me a beer, buddy.</i>

165
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,878
<i>Hello?</i>

166
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,382
That's what we do. That's right.

167
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,513
Benny, my man.

168
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:36,915
I thought you had him, brother.

169
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,081
Nah, I had him in the turns.

170
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,918
Where were you? We missed you,
brother, we missed you.

171
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,083
What do you mean?

172
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,216
I was flying, watching your butts.

173
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,727
- You were flying?
- Flying?

174
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,559
- I didn't see him flying.
- Y'all gonna play me like that?

175
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,257
- I didn't see him flying.
- Did you see him flying?

176
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,232
Maybe you should ask
the shopping cart guy

177
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,484
If he saw you flying up there.

178
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,605
Shots fired! Boom, boom!

179
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,215
So I'm supposed to watch out for cops,

180
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,174
Fly the plane,
make sure you got a clear lane

181
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,109
and look out for homeless people
coming out of the shadows?

182
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,873
I didn't get that memo, I'm sorry.

183
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,897
Nice driving.

184
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,196
I'm impressed.

185
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,865
<i>"Tobey Marsha“.</i>

186
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,400
The man to beat in Mount Kisco.

187
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,476
Sorry about your old man.

188
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:40,745
I know you were close.

189
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:44,047
You lost, Dino?

190
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,751
What?

191
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,285
I mean, I haven't seen you
around for a long time.

192
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,759
I figured, you know, you must be lost.

193
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,220
So, nothing has changed.

194
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,225
After 10 years, you wanna
just pick up some locker room fight.

195
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,562
What do you want?

196
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,603
I wanna see you build a real car.

197
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,606
I got plenty of cars to build, Dino.

198
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,843
Yeah.

199
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,812
How's that going for you?

200
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,750
I didn't come to insult you.

201
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,594
I came to make a business proposition.

202
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,920
It could be a game-changer for you.

203
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,922
Are you handing out
dreams now, Dino'?

204
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:26,086
I've seen a hundred custom racing
shops since I left this town.

205
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,930
I still haven't seen
work <i>as</i> good as yours.

206
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,700
That's these guys. Not me.

207
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,135
I have a very special car
that needs to be finished.

208
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,814
What kind of car are we talking about?

209
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,467
Ford Mustang.

210
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:40,433
A Mustang?

211
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,678
It's the one Ford
and Carroll Shelby were building

212
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,477
when Carroll died.

213
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,214
How did you get it?

214
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,514
Mr. Shelby and my uncle,
they were close.

215
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,357
You finish building my Mustang
like you rebuilt that Gran Torino,

216
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,620
I'll give you a quarter
of what we get for the car.

217
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,287
A quarter?

218
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,229
The car is worth 2 million.

219
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:04,961
Minimum.

220
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,064
That's $500,000 in your pocket.

221
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,735
Forget about the past, Tobey.

222
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,641
It's history.

223
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,982
I'm here to make peace.

224
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,419
And money.

225
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,714
Don't answer me now.

226
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,225
Just think about it.

227
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,989
I don't need to think about it.

228
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,997
I'll do it.

229
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,332
I'll get the car here tomorrow.

230
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,344
Okay, I just wanna be the first
to take the floor here and ask you...

231
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:01,016
Have you lost your mind?

232
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,182
You're gonna have us
work for Dino Brewster?

233
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,353
Word?

234
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:05,928
What are you thinking, Tobey?

235
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,122
You don't wanna have anything
to do with that piece of shit.

236
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,565
And, look, if this is about Anita,
trying to get her back or something...

237
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,103
Do it another way, homie.

238
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,364
Write a poem or some shit. Okay?

239
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:16,768
I'll help you out.

240
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,877
"Dear Anita,
Nothing is sweeter than Anita

241
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,809
"I really aneeda... Anita"

242
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,115
And I just came up with that just now.

243
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,547
Just now!

244
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,453
Yo, forget about
that fool and his turtleneck.

245
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,482
All right? Just tell him you're out.

246
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,718
We're doing fine without him.

247
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,293
We're not.

248
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,560
Okay. We're not doing fine.

249
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,601
Look...

250
00:18:56,235 --> 00:19:00,411
I'm behind on the loan.

251
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,779
That guy from earlier...

252
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,183
That guy is from the bank.

253
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,815
And he's just gonna keep coming back.

254
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:14,929
Tobey, if you say we need him,

255
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,162
then I'm with you.

256
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:23,801
Wait. We made five grand tonight.

257
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,034
It's gotta be enough
to make the payment.

258
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,438
What about next month?

259
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,943
We'll figure it out.

260
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,511
We always do.

261
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,049
This time it's different, okay?

262
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,791
If you guys don't show up tomorrow

263
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,360
to work on that car,

264
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,125
we're gonna lose this place.

265
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,795
Hey, come on, guys.

266
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,167
This is Carroll Shelby.

267
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,708
This is an opportunity of a lifetime.

268
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,211
We're doing this. All right? For Tobey.

269
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,804
9:30 tomorrow. Don't be late.

270
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,087
You're cheating, man. Quit cheating!

271
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,883
You just can't keep up.

272
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,254
Shit!

273
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,495
Here we go.

274
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,830
Yeah.

275
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,532
All right, all right, all right.

276
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,345
Where is the rest of it?

277
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,843
We got a lot of work to do.

278
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,041
Yeah.

279
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,634
Do you like that car over there?

280
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,601
- Yeah, it's nice.
- Yeah.

281
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,767
We built that.

282
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,275
So, you're a mechanic.

283
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,609
That was real smooth, bro.

284
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:21,445
Hey. Do you like that car over there?

285
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,614
Okay. Excuse me.

286
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,449
We built that.

287
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:28,317
We're mechanics.

288
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,461
We're not afraid to get our hands dirty.

289
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:35,121
Do you know what I mean?

290
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,395
Do you like that car over there?

291
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,150
How fast does it go?

292
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,152
<i>Fast.</i>

293
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,882
Very fast. Pete.

294
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,316
Aren't all Mustangs fast?

295
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:08,663
Well, this one was built by Ford
and reimagined by Carroll Shelby,

296
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:11,358
the greatest performance car
builder in American history.

297
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,503
She's not from around here, Petey,

298
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,837
so she probably
has no idea who Carroll Shelby is.

299
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,507
But why is it so fast?

300
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,237
It's 900 horsepower, baby.

301
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:25,247
Is that a lot?

302
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:27,912
- Are you kidding me?
- Petey.

303
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,179
Look, miss, this isn't the kind of car
you can just go to the mall and buy.

304
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,353
Trust me when I say, it's one of a kind.

305
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,850
Can I see the engine?

306
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,258
Sure.

307
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,273
5.8 liter, aluminum block,

308
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:59,549
SVT supercharger and racing headers.

309
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,711
Yeah, it's quite nice, actually.

310
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,122
I wasn't expecting that.

311
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,157
Nor was I.

312
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,454
Why?

313
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,893
Because I'm a woman?
Or because I'm from England?

314
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,294
Mr. Shelby's first Cobra was built
using an AC body made in England.

315
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,439
It had a Ford 260 CID V8 engine.

316
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,097
Of course, you already knew that.

317
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,004
Life can be full of surprises.

318
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,849
I find life to be full of
people who think they're smart

319
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,940
because they have a fancy accent.

320
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,008
No offense.

321
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,582
Some taken.

322
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,084
I really love Piers Morgan.

323
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:43,985
So, this is how it goes, is it?

324
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,653
You're very quiet, very tough,

325
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:49,130
and then you're just constantly
cracking these hilarious jokes.

326
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,457
Hey, Jules.

327
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,601
Three million is way too much
for this car, Dino.

328
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,436
Well, that's what it costs.

329
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,333
- Let's see what Ingram thinks.
- I am what Ingram thinks,

330
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,968
and he thinks two at the most.

331
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:03,104
Well, three is the number.

332
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,422
Three is absurd.
That's why nobody has bid on it.

333
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:07,978
That's the best car
I've driven since Indy.

334
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,813
You haven't driven it, Dino.
Tobey's had the keys the whole time.

335
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,581
Do you want me to turn around
and plug my ears

336
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,356
while you all gel on the same page?

337
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,119
What's the top speed?

338
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,528
- 180.
- 230.

339
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,655
230'?

340
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:24,631
He's talking about
a theoretical top speed.

341
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,631
I know that you don't really talk,

342
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,639
but maybe Mr. Strong and Silent
could be a little less silent.

343
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:31,975
She'll go 230.

344
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:34,168
Top NASCAR speed ever was 228.

345
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,473
This car is faster.

346
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,216
8:00 am, tomorrow at Shepperton.

347
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,254
You get anything close
to 230 out of this car,

348
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,882
Ingram is going to buy it on the spot.

349
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,220
For 3 million.

350
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,020
Give or take a million.

351
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,656
Mostly take.

352
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:56,893
Good night, lads.

353
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:00,061
Bye.

354
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:03,832
230'?

355
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,998
Are you crazy?
What if I can't get the car there?

356
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:09,107
Well, maybe you can't,

357
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:11,738
but I can.

358
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,210
I'll drive.

359
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,509
Don't even think about driving that car.

360
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,544
Yeah, Tobey!

361
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,464
What are you guys doing?

362
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,797
Stop! Stop!

363
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,736
What the hell are you doing?

364
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,469
You don't own this car!
You don't get to joyride it!

365
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,773
Top speed just over 230.

366
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,472
234.

367
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,776
According to this.

368
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,580
He!-

369
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:28,618
That was some driving, son.

370
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,628
And that is one hell of a car.

371
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,621
It's going to cost me $3 million?

372
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:36,430
That's the price.

373
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,466
2.7.

374
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:55,281
2.7 million?

375
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,383
What the hell were you thinking?

376
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:02,156
We sold the car, Dino.

377
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,520
You never could've got that car to 230.
Even on our track.

378
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,490
You think you're
a better driver than me?

379
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:13,228
Everyone knows he's a better driver.

380
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:15,634
You know, I'm just about
done with you, Pete.

381
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,297
Hey! Back off, Dino.

382
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,636
I'll beat you on a track, the dirt,

383
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,645
a road, anywhere else you wanna race.

384
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,179
Hey, you're the man, okay?

385
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:26,338
You're the pro.

386
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:27,713
You got nothing to prove to me.
Let's move on.

387
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:28,874
No.

388
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,315
No, let's race.

389
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:34,150
If you win, I'll give you
my 75% of the Mustang deal.

390
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,022
If you lose,

391
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:39,026
you give me your 25%.

392
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,829
Well, that makes it interesting.

393
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,837
This is the biggest house
I've ever seen.

394
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,173
It's my uncle's place.

395
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,843
Don't worry, he's in Monaco.

396
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,522
These aren't even legal
in the United States.

397
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,387
They're all Euro-spec cars,

398
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,193
so technically,
they don't even exist here.

399
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,892
Are they some kind of Ferrari?

400
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,858
Koenigsegg Agera R.

401
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,194
Top speed, 270 miles an hour.

402
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:21,732
But, Dino, I thought
you didn't go faster than 180.

403
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,206
You got a big mouth for a fan.

404
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,038
Yeah, well, then let me race.

405
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:30,874
I'll be happy to have you, Pete.

406
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:32,709
- Awesome. I'm in.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

407
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,246
Hey. Sit this one out.

408
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:36,408
No. Lei him be a big boy.

409
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,648
Three identical Ageras.

410
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:42,782
After you.

411
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:55,936
The finish line is at the end
of the bridge, over the 684.

412
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,574
The first car to get
to the other side wins.

413
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:08,915
<i>Tobey!-.</i>

414
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,319
This is my vision.

415
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:17,992
This is how I saw you winning De Leon.

416
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,962
You beat Dino, take his car and win.

417
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:42,979
Wow.

418
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:30,715
Whoa!

419
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,481
Thanks, little buddy!

420
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,085
You got it' man!

421
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,358
Yeah, Pete.

422
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,506
Come on!

423
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,017
We got him, Pete.

424
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,396
No!

425
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,376
No, no, no, no, no.

426
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,365
Pete!

427
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,802
No!

428
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,730
No!

429
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:52,417
"Fear not, for I am with you.

430
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,488
"Be not dismayed, for I am your God.

431
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:58,158
"Behold, all those who
were incensed against you

432
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,600
"shall be ashamed and disgraced.

433
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,330
"They shall be nothing.

434
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:07,877
"Those who war against you
shall be as nothing.

435
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:11,175
"For I shall hold your right hand,
saying to you,

436
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:15,274
"'Fear not, I will help you."'

437
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,978
Let's go through this again,
Mr. Marshall.

438
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:23,456
A couple witnesses say
they may have seen three cars,

439
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:26,619
but we can't find the third car.

440
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,497
Why don't you use
that diagram there to show us

441
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,693
where you claim
the third car to have been.

442
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:42,808
My car was about
two car lengths ahead.

443
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:50,385
This is where Pete was,
and Dino was right behind him.

444
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:54,821
He tapped his back bumper hard,
and at an angle.

445
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,860
Dino has two witnesses who say they
were with him the whole day.

446
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,028
And the owner of Brewster Motors

447
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:03,999
reported two Koenigseggs
stolen last week.

448
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:09,831
Just seven minutes before police
arrived at the scene of the crash.

449
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,834
That's his uncle, okay?

450
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,876
They're lying.

451
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:20,879
All right? He was there.

452
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:25,254
Dino was there.

453
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,448
Mr. Marshall,

454
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:33,025
you're the only one
that can place Dino at the scene.

455
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,924
No way is this happening.

456
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,397
This isn't happening.

457
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,939
Pete... This isn't happening.

458
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,397
<i>- Bill Ingram speaking.</i>
- Sign <i>here.</i>

459
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:11,625
<i>Mr. Ingram, Tobey Marshall.</i>

460
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:14,067
<i>I need to borrow your Mustang
to race De Leon.</i>

461
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,000
<i>Excuse me, son?</i>

462
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,675
<i>You wan! 10 race
my Mustang in De Leon?</i>

463
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,073
<i>What's in it for me?</i>

464
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,612
<i>When I win, I will give you half the cars.</i>

465
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,918
<i>That's around $4 million for you.</i>

466
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,683
<i>I'll think about it.</i>

467
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,619
<i>I'll call Julia.</i>

468
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,920
All right. Step forward. Go. Everybody.

469
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,435
Come on. Come to me.

470
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:47,934
That's my boy.

471
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:49,127
Is Joe in?

472
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:50,594
Already on the road with the Beast.

473
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,748
If this thing works,
we're gonna need that head start.

474
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:53,936
What about Finn?

475
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,341
We haven't convinced him yet,
but we will. It's Finn.

476
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,382
But more importantly'
do we even have a vehicle?

477
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,508
I'll know in an hour.

478
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,686
Hey, thanks for dropping it off.

479
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:13,914
And thank Ingram for me, please.

480
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,090
So, what do you think?

481
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,023
First American car to win De Leon?

482
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,186
Definitely.

483
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:21,386
You don't even have an invite.

484
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,962
Monarch is gonna want
this car in the race.

485
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:29,901
Nobody knows where
the race is until you get the invite,

486
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:34,066
so exactly where would you
be driving off to?

487
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:36,712
Well, on the low,
we know it's in California,

488
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,213
we just don't know where.

489
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,415
And we also know
that one of the drivers is...

490
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:41,973
- Benny.
- Okay, I'll shut up.

491
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,882
California is quite a big state

492
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:49,153
and you might remember
that I'm a numbers girl.

493
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:52,124
Okay, so what are
your numbers telling you?

494
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,490
There's a drivers' meeting
the night before the race.

495
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:58,429
And that means you
have 45 hours or less

496
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:03,131
to get from New York
to somewhere in California.

497
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:05,431
And your problem is...

498
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,669
We better get going.

499
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,437
It's 45 hours and counting.

500
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,410
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, wait, wait!

501
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:14,345
You're not going anywhere.

502
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:17,847
You need a right-seater.

503
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:22,690
And Ingram is not going
to leave this car

504
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,420
in the hands of an ex-con

505
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,831
who is about to leave
the state and break parole.

506
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:34,630
44 hours and 59 minutes left.

507
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,203
Let's go.

508
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:48,349
<i>Okay-</i>

509
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,146
Maybe we can just
ditch her at a gas station or something.

510
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:52,845
Hey, man. Look, you want her gone?

511
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,991
I'll broom her ass out. Okay?

512
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,526
Just follow me, dude. I'll have you
driving like a bat out of hell.

513
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,152
She'll be screaming
to get out of this car.

514
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,165
She's just crazy, you know'?

515
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:05,567
She talks too much.

516
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:28,991
Okay, so you've never
been a right-seater.

517
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:31,320
Well, if you see something
I'm doing wrong,

518
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,759
just point it out.

519
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,096
First of all, you're wearing high heels.

520
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,758
We just call them heels.

521
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:43,401
But if it's a real problem,
then I can always...

522
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,402
I've got a change of
shoes in my overnight bag.

523
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:49,844
Yep, okay-

524
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,349
So, is there anything else

525
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,511
that right-seaters are supposed to do?

526
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,619
Be quiet.

527
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:02,357
<i>Hello, Beauty.
This is Maverick speaking,</i>

528
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,452
<i>the most awesome pilot
in the universe.</i>

529
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,061
Just wanted to give you a heads-up

530
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,756
and tell you about a little
stop-and-go traffic up ahead.

531
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:10,093
Nothing too serious.

532
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,967
We got traffic up ahead.
We're gonna need to reroute.

533
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:18,135
I don't see any traffic.

534
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:21,801
Well, Benny does,
and he sees everything.

535
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,113
<i>Al! right. Now, give me
a dollar on the next exit.</i>

536
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,942
What's a dollar?

537
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,393
<i>Hard right for lane three.</i>

538
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,160
<i>In three,</i>

539
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,290
two,

540
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:46,424
- one.
- Uh, no.

541
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:47,626
<i>Now.</i>

542
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:54,223
<i>You're looking a little
filthy down there, Beauty.</i>

543
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:55,626
- It's time to get you clean.
What?

544
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,443
<i>Hard left U in three, two, one.</i>

545
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:06,483
Oh. my God!

546
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:14,685
<i>Go</i> three...

547
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:15,786
<i>Now.</i>

548
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:25,600
<i>You are moving, baby!</i>

549
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,852
You do at least see the SUV
that we are about to slam into?

550
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:47,829
You meant that one? The green one?

551
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:55,464
Tobey!

552
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,203
- You see the bus, right?
What's that?

553
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,567
The bus!

554
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:05,912
The bus! The bus! The bus!

555
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,004
Go two, now.

556
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,689
Looks like a scene
out of Speed down there.

557
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,255
<i>Hard left in three, Keanu.</i>

558
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:20,488
You mean that bus, bus, bus.

559
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,498
Just so you know,
your friend Benny sucks.

560
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:26,032
<i>Hard left in one.</i>

561
00:45:32,697 --> 00:45:34,074
<i>My man!</i>

562
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,735
<i>You got some skills, boy.
You know you bad.</i>

563
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,209
<i>You know you bad!</i>

564
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:56,222
Beauty, it looks to me like you're
all clear from here, my friend.

565
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:57,589
That's right.

566
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:01,363
<i>I'm just gonna keep
doing my thing, and...</i>

567
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:05,701
<i>Fly like an eagle, to the sea</i>

568
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:09,310
<i>Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me</i>

569
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:12,414
<i>Go on and fly!</i>

570
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:24,319
You know, I get that driving fast
is going to be necessary,

571
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:27,055
but driving like a complete maniac
in order to scare me out of the car

572
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,722
is not going to work.

573
00:46:29,754 --> 00:46:30,892
Are you sure about that?

574
00:46:33,057 --> 00:46:34,331
Is that what you think?

575
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:42,503
Whatever you think about me,

576
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:44,568
I'm sure it's wrong.

577
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,642
Educate me.

578
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,276
So you think just because

579
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:53,822
I make a living buying cars
designed to triple the speed limit,

580
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,688
and because I drive a Maserati,
and by the way, I'm an awesome driver,

581
00:46:56,781 --> 00:46:58,501
that you have the right
to condescend to me?

582
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:07,835
Well, this is going to be the longest
44 hours and 11 minutes of your life.

583
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:16,772
I'm not trying to be an asshole.

584
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,007
You don't have to try that hard.

585
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:21,447
The sound of a guy called the Monarch

586
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,678
who hosts a secret race
is hard to believe.

587
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,684
He's supposedly from
an old wealthy family

588
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:28,154
that made their money
in the Industrial Revolution.

589
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:29,999
- And no one knows who he is?
- No one.

590
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:34,791
Legend is he sponsored
a few Formula One teams

591
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:36,727
but always campaigned
under other names.

592
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:38,794
A man of mystery.

593
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,869
Mystery and a bad heart.

594
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,833
He had a dalliance <i>as</i> a driver,

595
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:45,533
but his head stopped
like a watch one day.

596
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,902
So he quit.

597
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:49,408
So what's the prize for this De Leon'?

598
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,975
Well,

599
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:55,140
big risks come with big rewards.

600
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:58,480
Maybe that's why I walked away
with $6 million worth of cars.

601
00:47:58,576 --> 00:48:00,817
- That sounds like a good day's work.
- Yes, it was.

602
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:05,256
Look, I don't mean to push you,
but I have another interested party.

603
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:07,987
I'm not 100% sure about them.
You know that feeling?

604
00:48:09,153 --> 00:48:11,064
I liked what I saw at your dealership.

605
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:14,329
The problem I have is,
you haven't shown a hard profit yet.

606
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:17,336
But I thought you said the dealership
was in profits last year.

607
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:23,941
Let me be blunt.

608
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,844
What do I have to do to get
a real commitment from you?

609
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:29,575
I'll be blunt back.
What's a real commitment?

610
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,741
Five million.

611
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,258
Okay, but

612
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,418
you have to win this
secret De Leon again.

613
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:43,756
And all those cars that come with it.

614
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,283
Yo.

615
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:05,887
<i>Checking in.</i>

616
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:10,381
Mile marker 417. We're on schedule.

617
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:14,618
I know we're on schedule.
I'm checking on you, bro.

618
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:17,894
I was just sitting here thinking,

619
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:21,498
Pete would have loved this trip.

620
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:23,599
Yeah.

621
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:28,275
He loved the impossible, huh?

622
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:30,776
Perfect for Petey.

623
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:34,246
<i>Where's your head at, brother?</i>

624
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:37,575
I'll never forget what I saw that day.

625
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:40,754
<i>Listen, don't you wow.</i>

626
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,016
<i>Dino's gonna get what's coming to him.</i>

627
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:46,528
Just don't forget why we're doing this.

628
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:51,593
I'll see you in Detroit, brother.
Beast out.

629
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:01,970
I'm sorry about Pete.

630
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:12,110
He just left him there.

631
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:16,951
That's what I can't forgive.

632
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,624
That's what this is really
about then, isn't it'?

633
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:50,018
Good morning.

634
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,671
Dude, stop calling me, okay?
We've already had this conversation.

635
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:13,075
<i>Just go to the window.
No.</i>

636
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:15,873
Why?

637
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:19,347
<i>Just go to the window.
Quit being a little bitch.</i>

638
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:22,914
You're the bitch.

639
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:39,063
<i>Unit 4-Adam,</i>

640
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:40,766
<i>report of noise complaint,

641
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:42,264
<i>Vehicle description, silver</i> Ford...

642
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,109

00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:47,106
<i>- Keeping the engine hot.
- Unit 4 responding.</i>

644
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:49,445
You're gonna attract
attention to yourself.

645
00:51:53,544 --> 00:51:55,717
Shit.

646
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,231
Is that your car, son?

647
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,967
No, no, no, no, no.

648
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,401
Are you crazy?
Do you know how expensive this car is?

649
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,101
Why don't you just
take it around the corner?

650
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:16,608
Hey, hey, did you see
how fast I was going?

651
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:20,408
It must have been, like,
160 on that off-ramp.

652
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:23,245
You should drive this car. It's amazing!

653
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:26,411
- Officer, I am so sorry.
- It's insane! Insane.

654
00:52:26,577 --> 00:52:29,183
My boyfriend was showing off.
He's trying to impress me.

655
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:32,623
Why don't we just take
it around the block? Now.

656
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:38,524
"Boyfriend"?

657
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:41,269
I'm just trying to keep us out of jail.

658
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:44,939
Well, you might wanna fix your hair.

659
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:50,777
For my mug shot?

660
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:51,869
No.

661
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:56,983
Because I'm about to make you famous.

662
00:52:58,475 --> 00:52:59,613
<i>Finn, are you there?</i>

663
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:01,450
<i>- I'm here.
- All right.</i>

664
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:03,114
Don't mind the cop.
That's not the problem.

665
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,282
Watch how the car leans
as he pulls away.

666
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:07,224
That's our problem.

667
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:09,453
Go, go!

668
00:53:24,068 --> 00:53:26,571
In pursuit' modified Ford Mustang.

669
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,177
<i>Heading east on Woodward.</i>

670
00:53:35,646 --> 00:53:36,818
The car is loose.

671
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:38,649
Yeah, I know. Thank you for that.

672
00:53:38,816 --> 00:53:42,263
If Tobey runs that setup in De Leon,
he won't finish, let alone win.

673
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:43,353
He is in?

674
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,155
Maybe.

675
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:46,657
<i>Look, we have a plan.</i>

676
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,101
And what does that mean?

677
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:50,763
<i>It means we know what we're doing.
Get your ass down here, bitch.</i>

678
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,247
Finn! Finn, you okay, buddy?

679
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,960
Casual Friday.

680
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,467
Finn, man, what's up?

681
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:27,766
Jacki.

682
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,944
I've always wanted to do that.

683
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,051
Yeah!

684
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,827
Have a nice day,
you miserable bastards.

685
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,295
Finn, call me!

686
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:04,610
My friend is running
the fastest Mustang in the world

687
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:05,806
at De Leon on Sunday

688
00:55:05,903 --> 00:55:07,974
and the setup is all wrong.

689
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:11,685
I'm in accounting.

690
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:15,155
Don't you feel like you're dying inside?

691
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,518
Yes.

692
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,860
It's cold in here.

693
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:32,664
Where's the Beast?

694
00:55:33,197 --> 00:55:34,540
What the hell?

695
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:35,938
- Where are your clothes?
- Did you miss this?

696
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,942
No, I didn't miss it.
Don't touch me, man.

697
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,808
Stay away! We gotta go, let's go.

698
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:40,940
You missed me, didn't you?

699
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:42,640
No. Get off!

700
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,983
<i>We got the shaved bird.
We're jumping in the Beast.</i>

701
00:55:46,143 --> 00:55:48,851
We're behind.
We got 28 hours to get to Cali.

702
00:55:48,946 --> 00:55:50,016
Copy that.

703
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,717
- Good morning.
- Oh, my God.

704
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:53,624
So, why the hell are you naked?

705
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,186
To make sure I'd never come back.

706
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,628
I'm sure you could've
done that another way.

707
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:59,497
Let's be clear, though,
you're not wearing my underwear.

708
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,974
There's a helicopter
in the middle of the street.

709
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:16,876
Hello?

710
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:19,978
<i>WNKW with a question
for Tobey Marshall.</i>

711
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:23,556
On a scale from one to ten,
how crazy hot is your passenger?

712
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:27,858
Like my new wheels? Bitchin', right?

713
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:31,657
What happened to the Cessna?

714
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:33,529
<i>Flight restrictions in the city, man.</i>

715
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,770
<i>But it's all good.
I borrowed my buddy's little bird.</i>

716
00:56:35,926 --> 00:56:37,030
<i>Let me get a hard right.</i>

717
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,258
<i>Y'all lucky, I almost got
my hands on that Apache</i>

718
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,886
from Great Lakes Army Air Base,

719
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:54,388
but Colonel Gatins
was sweating me hard.

720
00:56:54,678 --> 00:56:55,748
Here we go again.

721
00:56:56,013 --> 00:56:57,458
<i>Not talking to you, Beast.</i>

722
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,462
Roger that, Liar One.

723
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:06,191
Finn, you're back in the crew
for all of 10 minutes

724
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,361
and you're already
up my skirt talking shit.

725
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,806
Man, you're gonna rue the day
you started calling me that.

726
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:16,107
What, did you
all of a sudden go to college, fool?

727
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,303
Wow. What a really
ignorant thing to say.

728
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:20,744
<i>God, are you ignorant.</i>

729
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:22,781
Is it gonna be like this the entire way?

730
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:31,620
<i>A reminder, the Motown Marathon
races through town this weekend...</i>

731

732
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,761
Standing by.

733
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,628
But for today's traffic,
we go live to Romeo

734
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:41,396
in the Channel 10 traffic helicopter.

735
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:43,469
<i>- How are we looking, Romeo?</i>
- Cut <i>to two.</i>

<i>Bum, bum, bum, bum!</i>

00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,309
Is Romeo in the helicopter?
What's going on?

739
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,140

740
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,737

this is gonna sound insane,

751
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:44,611
but I need a two-lane grasshopper
in order to get these guys off your back.

752
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,156
- Roger.
- What's a grasshopper?

753
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:48,360
You may wanna
close your eyes for this.

754
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:50,469
Is it worse than "Bus, bus, bus"?

<i>All right. Now, just aim for the trees.</i>

756

I got a bunch of trolls

I'm looking at footage
of a car that supposedly disappeared.

842

That's the same car

There were three cars in the race
the day that Pete died, that's a fact.

891
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,442
And anyone that says
that Tobey is responsible

892
01:08:24,534 --> 01:08:26,605
for Pete's death, answer this.

893
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:28,614
Why jump parole in New York

894
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:31,652
knowing that you are going to be
re-arrested and do serious time,

895
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:34,779
unless you are innocent
and hell-bent to right a wrong?

896

958
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:22,628
No, sir. No.

959
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:27,073
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.

960
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:30,176
If you'd step out to my cruiser,
shouldn't take but a minute.

961
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,472
Stop!

962
01:14:42,278 --> 01:14:43,484
Stop right there!

963
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:53,966
Tobey? He's following me.

964
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:55,798
<i>I know. Where are you!?</i>

965
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:57,166
I'm upstairs. I'm in a room.

966
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,101
All right, is there a window?

967
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:02,369
It's on the second floor.

968
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:04,467
Open up this door!

969
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:07,013
Look, just climb out the window.
I'll come get you.

970
01:15:07,103 --> 01:15:08,173
<i>Okay-</i>

971
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:11,114
I'm gonna tell you one more time,
open up this door!

972
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:17,655
Any units in the area? Over.

973
01:15:19,115 --> 01:15:20,958
Ma'am, other units are on their way.

974
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:27,123
Where are you?

975
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:38,501
Hey, you gotta jump. Let's go.

976
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:40,308
No, I can't jump. I'm afraid of heights.

977
01:15:42,805 --> 01:15:44,182
It's not high. Come on.

978
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,742
No, I can't. I'm afraid of heights.

979
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:47,921
- I don't know what to do!
- Just trust me. Sit down.

980
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,148
Okay? Sit down.

981
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:53,718
Just close your eyes and count to three.

982
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:55,260
All right? On three.

983
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:56,726
One, two...

984
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:06,738
<i>Unit 445, there are no other
units available at this time.</i>

985
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:11,603
Copy that.
In pursuit of the silver Mustang.

986
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:37,193
Where is he?

987
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:38,869
He's not coming.

988
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:41,268
Are you sure?

989
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:43,974
Trust me.

990
01:16:47,036 --> 01:16:48,913
Hey, you know...

991
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:53,152
That was really impressive back there.

992
01:16:53,876 --> 01:16:56,220
I just thought you should know.

993
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:06,061
Hey, do you think
you could drive for a few hours?

994
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:12,664
Let's just... Let's switch.

995
01:17:14,497 --> 01:17:15,999
It's all right.

996
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:19,474
Okay, steady.

997
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:21,639
There you go.

998
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:24,975
All right, don't kill us.

999
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:37,657
That's nice.

1000
01:17:38,621 --> 01:17:39,929
Have you got her'?

1001
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,593
- Yeah.
- All right.

1002
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:44,832
Good.

1003
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:47,637
Good, good, good.

1004
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,220
Jesus!

1005
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,320
That was on purpose.

1006
01:18:45,354 --> 01:18:46,731
Yeah, thanks to Dino's bounty.

1007
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:50,830
They're coming at you.

1008
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:53,833
<i>Copy that.</i>

1009
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:57,008
Wait, wait. See?
They're trying to trap us.

1010
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:58,340
Here, just drift onto the shoulder.

1011
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,880
No, no, no, I'm going for the Hummer.

1012
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:01,412
He's a pavement prowler.

1013
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:02,538
Pavement what?

1014
01:19:02,605 --> 01:19:04,949
It's a show car with a big lift kit.

1015
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,520
It makes up for his inferiority complex.

1016
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:13,849
Wait. Are you crazy?

1017
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:17,723
Wait, wait! Whoa, whoa!

1018
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:23,025
Whoa! Jesus!

1019
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:28,608
You are crazy!

1020
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,275
Nice. Nice, nice.

1021
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:43,548
No, keep it straight!

1022
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:49,051
Holy shit.

1023
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,393
Okay, Larry, bring it.

1024
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,725
<i>Go! it. We're moving out.</i>

1025
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,468
Shoot the tires, but don't kill them.

1026
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:04,838
All right. Now, when I say,

1027
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:07,345
you're gonna let up on the gas
and you're gonna make a hard left.

1028
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:08,437
- OKay?
- OKay

1029
01:20:08,504 --> 01:20:09,504
- Okay!
- Okay.

1030
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:10,948
Your instincts are gonna say...

1031
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:12,007
Just do it!

1032
01:20:13,509 --> 01:20:14,579
Now!

1033
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:24,820
Don't let up.

1034
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:29,109
Blast those buggers.
We'll get them on the split.

1035
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:44,679
Hey, Liar One, you got your ears on?

1036
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:51,514
Son of a bitch!

1037
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:54,521
We need to find another road.

1038
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:58,521
Liar One, we need you!

1039
01:21:06,562 --> 01:21:07,973
You gotta go faster.

1040
01:21:10,499 --> 01:21:11,978
No, two hands on the wheel!

1041
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:23,149
Shit!

1042
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:35,566
Liar One, is that you?

1043
01:21:40,162 --> 01:21:41,334
Hook up, hook up!

1044
01:21:47,169 --> 01:21:49,513
Sergeant Jackson,
this is not what we discussed.

1045
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:52,182
Sir, will you relax? Okay?

1046
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,686
I got this.

1047
01:22:00,783 --> 01:22:01,887
We're good!

1048
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:04,590
You gotta tell me you believe I can
fly an Apache helicopter, man.

1049
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,029
<i>What?
- I'm serious, bro.</i>

1050
01:22:07,623 --> 01:22:09,296
<i>You're always trying to play me.</i>

1051
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:11,131
<i>Tell me you believe I can fly
an Apache helicopter.</i>

1052
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:12,967
Tell him whatever he wants!

1053
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:14,870
Yeah, you can fly an Apache helicopter!

1054
01:22:15,364 --> 01:22:16,404
And my handle is Maverick.

1055
01:22:16,532 --> 01:22:18,093
Gotta call me Maverick, let me hear it.

1056
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:20,040
Maverick! Maverick!

1057
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:21,542
Maverick!

1058
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:23,707
Was that so bad?

1059
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:25,109
Shit!

1060
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:26,311
Benny!

1061
01:22:31,213 --> 01:22:32,749
Holy shit!

1062
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:49,969
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Julia, hey!

1063
01:22:50,232 --> 01:22:51,404
Look at me.

1064
01:22:52,768 --> 01:22:54,304
Just breathe. Breathe.

1065
01:22:56,572 --> 01:22:58,279
Good.

1066
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:04,920
Look into my eyes.

1067
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,017
Look into my eyes. Good.

1068
01:23:08,517 --> 01:23:10,258
What color are they?

1069
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,191
They're really blue.

1070
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:16,436
They're really blue. Good, good.

1071
01:23:16,525 --> 01:23:19,267
They're a lot bluer than yours.

1072
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:20,966
- No!
- Yes, they are.

1073
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:22,700
- They're not!
- Yes!

1074
01:23:22,798 --> 01:23:24,141
They're not bluer!

1075
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:26,440
- Admit it!
- Mine are bluer!

1076
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:29,647
- Oh, God!
- Wow.

1077
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:33,880
Benny! Don't drop us!

1078
01:23:33,976 --> 01:23:34,977
What?

1079
01:23:35,878 --> 01:23:37,380
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1080
01:23:37,613 --> 01:23:39,320
I'm kidding. We're good, we're good.

1081
01:23:50,826 --> 01:23:51,827
What the hell is that?

1082
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:08,213
Yeah!

1083
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,914
Yeah!

1084
01:24:11,013 --> 01:24:13,015
Yeah, Tobey!

1085
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:14,355
Hey, Benny!

1086
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:16,323
We believe you, baby!

1087
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:18,422
We believe you, Maverick!

1088
01:24:22,658 --> 01:24:24,501
Look at me, bitches!

1089
01:24:24,693 --> 01:24:25,899
We're good!

1090
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:27,529
Yeah!

1091
01:24:29,665 --> 01:24:30,769
Go!

1092
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:40,614
Are you guys Okay?

1093
01:24:40,709 --> 01:24:41,710
Yeah.

1094
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:51,557
<i>Major Davis,
you are in violation of your flight plan.</i>

1095
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:52,621
My bad.

1096
01:24:52,955 --> 01:24:55,458
<i>Return that bird to base immediately.</i>

1097
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:59,227
Looks like I'm gonna have
to go away for a while, y'all.

1098
01:24:59,361 --> 01:25:01,363
But Benny always comes back.

1099
01:25:03,365 --> 01:25:06,972
Godspeed, boys. Godspeed.

1100
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,472
You're 23 minutes late.

1101
01:26:16,705 --> 01:26:18,665
- Are you checking in, sir'?
<i>- I'll</i> be right back.

1102
01:26:38,627 --> 01:26:40,971
I'm surprised you made it.

1103
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:43,507
I'm impressed.

1104
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,174
What's going on in
that head of yours, Tobey?

1105
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:52,151
You never went back for him.

1106
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:55,552
I wasn't there,

1107
01:26:56,478 --> 01:26:58,253
remember'?

1108
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:02,052
I was there to comfort
Anita at the funeral.

1109
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:03,754
Such a sweet, innocent girl.

1110
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:10,494
Do you wanna do this here?

1111
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:14,704
Because one of us is on parole.

1112
01:27:16,832 --> 01:27:19,335
But you know that, right?

1113
01:27:27,843 --> 01:27:30,346
We'll settle this behind the wheel.

1114
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:34,420
I'm not worried about
you behind the wheel.

1115
01:27:34,516 --> 01:27:36,018
Really?

1116
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:39,726
Why did you put a bounty on me?

1117
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:42,759
Tomorrow is gonna be fun.

1118
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:44,866
Yeah.

1119
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:48,430
When you're hanging
upside down tomorrow,

1120
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:50,134
I'm not coming back for you.

1121
01:27:52,868 --> 01:27:55,075
Watch yourself, Tobey.

1122
01:27:57,639 --> 01:27:59,141
See you tomorrow.

1123
01:28:40,515 --> 01:28:42,756
You ran into him, didn't you?

1124
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,027
You need to forget about it.

1125
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:49,525
You need to let it go.

1126
01:28:54,196 --> 01:28:55,800
I think you need to get out of the car.

1127
01:28:55,864 --> 01:28:58,936
And you need a hot shower,
and you need a good meal,

1128
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:03,143
and some rest, and some food.

1129
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:09,016
And I'm going to book you a hotel room.

1130
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:14,050
No, I think it's best if you
just stay with me tonight.

1131
01:29:20,889 --> 01:29:24,063
You know, it's just safer...

1132
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:25,399
If you stay with me.

1133
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:32,205

1134
01:29:47,315 --> 01:29:49,352

1142
01:31:02,157 --> 01:31:06,902
Go. Before the cops get here, go.

why don't you just leave him?

1167
01:34:01,736 --> 01:34:03,682
I just did.

1168
01:34:14,249 --> 01:34:17,423
I know that Dino was there
the night my brother died.

1169

Yeah. He was.

So am I.

1175
01:36:00,855 --> 01:36:02,698
Why wouldn't he destroy it?

1176
01:36:03,925 --> 01:36:05,370
I have no idea.

1177
01:36:05,727 --> 01:36:09,539
I guess some people
just don't think they'll ever get caught.

How is she?

1179

You are not the girl I thought you were.

1186
01:38:15,089 --> 01:38:20,038
Well, you learn a lot about a person

1187
01:38:29,237 --> 01:38:32,013
What are you gonna do
about tomorrow?

1188
01:38:33,508 --> 01:38:35,579
I found a car.

1189
01:38:38,179 --> 01:38:41,422
Do I wanna know
where you found the car?

1190
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:43,960
No, you don't.

1191
01:38:44,118 --> 01:38:45,961
Is it fast?

1192
01:38:46,788 --> 01:38:49,234
It's fast enough, yeah.

1193
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:01,041
Do it for Pete.

1194
01:39:02,036 --> 01:39:03,538

1195
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:09,918
This is for Pete.

1196
01:39:17,552 --> 01:39:18,997
Yeah.

1197
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:57,826

01:40:13,207 --> 01:40:15,050
Sure. I'll be right back.

1202

<i>The third row has Johnny V

1212
01:41:01,355 --> 01:41:04,859
I'm looking at $7 million in cars

1213
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:08,199
and thousands of horsepower.
Winner takes all.

1214

<i>Tobey Marshall just stepped out of

1223

01:49:52,453 --> 01:49:54,126
Man. Wait a minute...

1277
01:49:54,888 --> 01:49:58,301
Wait a minute, Tobey Marshall has
somehow just taken the lead.

1278
01:49:58,392 --> 01:50:01,396
<i>Dino Brewster is running last
in third place?</i>

1279
01:50:02,029 --> 01:50:04,407
- Are you kidding me?
- Hold that lead! Hold that lead!

1280
01:50:05,466 --> 01:50:06,877
And then there were three.

1281
01:50:07,267 --> 01:50:09,247
<i>We need containment
set at Navarro Bridge.</i>

1282
01:50:21,582 --> 01:50:25,621
<i>H1, Mendo PD
is Code 3 to Navarro Bridge.</i>

1283
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:33,458
They're coming up
to the race marker to the bridge.

1284
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:35,972
<i>Tobey is clearly running first.
I can't believe it.</i>

1285
01:50:36,063 --> 01:50:39,636
<i>The blue collar kid from Mount Kisco
is trying to wear Cinderella's slipper.</i>

1286
01:50:39,733 --> 01:50:42,077
That's my dude! Mount Kisco, let's go!

1287
01:50:57,284 --> 01:51:00,959
<i>By the way, these cop cars,
they top out at about 130.</i>

1288
01:51:01,021 --> 01:51:02,796
Hold them back, baby! Hold them back.

1289
01:51:03,023 --> 01:51:05,663
Good luck catching up, Smokey.
I'll tell you who wins.

1290
01:51:36,857 --> 01:51:38,131
Come on!

1291
01:52:02,149 --> 01:52:03,822
<i>Dispatch, another suspect is down.</i>

1292
01:52:03,884 --> 01:52:05,488
<i>Only two remaining.</i>

1293
01:52:09,423 --> 01:52:12,233
<i>The Elemento just flicked
the P1 into a roll.</i>

1294
01:52:12,492 --> 01:52:16,372
<i>We're down to Tobey Marshall
and Dino Brewster.</i>

1295
01:52:18,232 --> 01:52:19,768
This ain't just about racing.

1296
01:52:50,530 --> 01:52:53,033
Don't do it. Tobey, don't let him do it.

1297
01:53:19,326 --> 01:53:21,932
Tobey Marshall just let
the Elemento get by him.

1298
01:53:21,995 --> 01:53:23,269
<i>- Nice move.
- That kid better wake up.</i>

1299
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:24,673
<i>Wake up, Tobey!</i>

1300
01:53:24,765 --> 01:53:29,236
Wake up and smell
that $2 million Lambo in your pocket.

1301
01:54:01,935 --> 01:54:04,882
Don't do it, brother.
It's not worth it. You can beat him.

1302
01:54:10,811 --> 01:54:13,451
Pete... I need you, pal.

1303
01:54:23,457 --> 01:54:24,629
Okay, let's go.

1304
01:54:58,358 --> 01:55:02,829
<i>Jeez, Dino took a swing and missed
and flipped the Elemento.</i>

1305
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:06,870
<i>Dino Brewster is out Down goes Dino!</i>

1306
01:55:07,033 --> 01:55:09,513
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1307
01:55:09,569 --> 01:55:12,550
<i>Tobey is the last man standing!
He's gonna win the De Leon!</i>

1308
01:55:12,606 --> 01:55:14,108
He's gonna win the De Leon!

1309
01:55:14,274 --> 01:55:17,517
The Marshall kid from Mount Kisco!
He's gonna make a milk run to victory!

1310
01:55:17,577 --> 01:55:19,887
That's right! That's my boy!
That's my dude!

1311
01:55:19,946 --> 01:55:21,857
That's right. Give me space.
I'm about to twerk it out.

1312
01:55:21,915 --> 01:55:23,258
<i>Tobey is the last man standing!</i>

1313
01:55:23,350 --> 01:55:25,956
- Get <i>it. Hit it, hit it.
- He's gonna win the De Leon!</i>

1314
01:55:26,052 --> 01:55:27,690
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

1315
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:30,792
The kid from Mount Kisco!
The blue collar kid!

1316
01:55:48,742 --> 01:55:50,483
Wait! Wait.

1317
01:55:50,577 --> 01:55:51,749
What are you doing?

1318
01:55:51,812 --> 01:55:53,572
- What are you doing?
- Why are you stopping?

1319
01:56:19,773 --> 01:56:21,514
Come on, Come on.

1320
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:25,116
Come on.

1321
01:56:31,451 --> 01:56:32,930
Hey, you okay?

1322
01:56:32,986 --> 01:56:36,092
Yeah. I'm fine.

1323
01:56:39,092 --> 01:56:40,298
I'm fine.

1324
01:56:40,794 --> 01:56:42,967
Good. This is for Pete.

1325
01:58:10,517 --> 01:58:12,019
Let me see your hands!

1326
01:58:17,757 --> 01:58:19,065
Let me see your hands!

1327
01:58:19,225 --> 01:58:20,260
Now!

1328
01:59:03,403 --> 01:59:05,747
Stand up! Keep your hands
where I can see them.

1329
01:59:06,439 --> 01:59:10,148
<i>18-7, Euro plates

<i>registered to</i> a <i>Dino Brewster.</i>

1331
01:59:12,112 --> 01:59:14,285
Well, now, hold on, cretins.

1332
01:59:15,148 --> 01:59:18,129
I'm hearing over the scanners
that the Koenigsegg

1333
01:59:18,184 --> 01:59:20,289
does indeed belong to Dino

1334
01:59:20,353 --> 01:59:22,594
and that's the missing evidence
that killed Pete.

1335
01:59:25,125 --> 01:59:27,332
Well, then it looks
like Dino, Dino bambino

1336
01:59:27,427 --> 01:59:30,499
is going away for a long, longtime.

1337
02:00:17,744 --> 02:00:20,350
Well, kiddos, it looks like Tobey himself

1338
02:00:20,413 --> 02:00:22,586
is gonna enjoy three hots
and a cot in the pokey

1339
02:00:22,682 --> 02:00:24,491
for illegal street racing.

1340
02:00:26,686 --> 02:00:27,721
I don't know, Tobey.

1341
02:00:29,155 --> 02:00:31,601
A few months in jail
to prove your innocence.

1342
02:00:33,693 --> 02:00:35,434
<i>Was it worth it, kid?</i>

1343
02:01:11,030 --> 02:01:12,566
All right. Step forward.

1344
02:02:00,180 --> 02:02:01,750
Get in!

1345
02:02:02,115 --> 02:02:03,651
I'll drive.

1346
02:02:03,917 --> 02:02:06,659
I've seen you drive and it's terrifying.

1347

<i>Come on, lovebirds.</i>

<i>Maverick is getting out
for good behavior.</i>

1350
02:02:17,363 --> 02:02:19,502
<i>Yeah, apparently he started
some fitness program</i>

1351
02:02:19,599 --> 02:02:21,044
<i>for the inmates or some shit.</i>

<i>Let's go.</i>

1354
02:02:54,734 --> 02:02:56,338
Yeah.

1355
02:02:56,402 --> 02:02:58,348
Yeah, that's right, baby.

You're rocking with the champ.

You're rocking with the champ.
Number one.

1358
02:03:02,308 --> 02:03:05,152
Don't even call me Maverick no more.
Call me Benny the Champ.

1359
02:03:05,211 --> 02:03:07,384
That's right, baby.
That's good, Jeff. I see you, Jeff.

1360
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:10,393
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Gerald?

1361
02:03:10,483 --> 02:03:11,723
Twerk!

1362
02:03:11,818 --> 02:03:14,025
You know what? You got a solo.
Come on over here.

1363
02:03:14,087 --> 02:03:16,590
Let's see the solo, bro.
Let's see the solo.

1364
02:03:16,689 --> 02:03:19,226
Get it, Gerald! Get it, bro!

1365
02:03:22,028 --> 02:03:23,837
That's what I'm talking about, bro! Yes!
