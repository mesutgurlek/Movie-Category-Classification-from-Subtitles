1
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,708
<i>For once I believe you,</i>
<i>because you're just rotten enough.</i>

2
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,716
<i>- We're both rotten.</i>
<i>-And you are a little more rotten.</i>

3
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,282
<i>You got me to take care</i>
<i>of your husband for you...</i>

4
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,047
<i>...and you get security to take care</i>
<i>of Lola, maybe take care of me too.</i>

5
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,384
<i>And somebody else would have come</i>
<i>along to take care of the kidy for you.</i>

6
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:27,616
<i>That's the way you operated, baby.</i>

7
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,730
<i>Suppose it is? It's what you've got</i>
<i>cooked up for tonight any better?</i>

8
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,064
<i>I don't like that music anymore.</i>

9
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,067
<i>You mind if I close the window?</i>

10
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:59,254
<i>You can do better than that,</i>
<i>can't you baby?</i>

11
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,586
<i>Better try it again.</i>

12
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,929
<i>Maybe if I come a little closer?</i>

13
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,279
<i>How's this?</i>
<i>Think you can do it now?</i>

14
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,956
<i>Why didn't you shoot again, baby?</i>

15
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,299
<i>Don't tell me it's because you've been</i>
<i>in love with me all this time.</i>

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,299
<i>No. I never loved you Walter,</i>
<i>not you or anybody else.</i>

17
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,640
<i>I'm rotten to the heart,</i>
<i>I used you just as you said.</i>

18
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,305
<i>That's all you ever meant to me...</i>

19
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:55,310
- <i>...until a minute ago.</i>
- What the fuck are you doing?

20
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,987
Do you know what time it is?

21
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,655
Listen up.

22
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,332
At twenty two hundred...

23
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,328
...Wet suit's down the hole
when the snake hits the carpet.

24
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,004
Security lifts the key.

25
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,340
I terminate the torpedoes.

26
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,339
You charm the Snake
into the stall.

27
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,671
Bait and switch.

28
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,344
At twenty two twenty...

29
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,017
Wet suit turns
out the lights.

30
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,016
Glasses on.

31
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,911
I bag the snake.

32
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,353
Key in the bag.
Bag to the boat.

33
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,696
No radio unless absolutely necessary.

34
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,196
Code Red.
5 minutes to blackout.

35
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,869
Drop everything.
Walk away.

36
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,532
If the cops get you,
tell them the truth.

37
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,535
You know no one.

38
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,208
Got it?

39
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,543
Got it?

40
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,547
You have your passport?

41
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:16,562
The plane leaves tomorrow
at 0 seven hundred.

42
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,227
And remember,
no names and no guns!

43
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,069
Are you high?

44
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,749
Then stop dreaming, bitch.

45
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,744
This isn't a game tonight.
People can die.

46
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,749
Now get moving.

47
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,765
You forget something?

48
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,308
Stepping onto the red carpet here is
Régis Wargnier...

49
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,871
...the director of "East West"...

50
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,310
present tonight for
a special screening of his film...

51
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,979
...he is accompanied by
the producer Yves Marmion.

52
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,318
And the splendid actress
Sandrine Bonnaire.

53
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,313
On his right is Veronica...

54
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,657
...who is wearing a amazing top
in shape of a serpent.

55
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,657
It was especially designed
by Elli Medeiros.

56
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:01,231
And the reason why those young brawny
people in tuxedos are surrounding...

57
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,666
...the super model is that this piece
of jewelry is priceless.

58
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,666
Now, the people from Chopard
are telling me that this top...

59
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,339
...is actually adorned with
500 diamonds for...

60
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,009
- ...a total weight of 385 carats...
- Gee! That's worth a small fortune.

61
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:18,343
With an estimated value
of over 10 million dollars.

62
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,016
Check out that ass, man!

63
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,188
Look at those boobs!

64
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,531
Worth ten million dollars!

65
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,726
Check out the way that slut moves,
fuck, what is she on?

66
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:16,735
- I can't believe you did that!
- I'm sorry, I was looking at the girl.

67
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,078
Yeah, you were looking,
but you ruined my pants!

68
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,970
- What am I supposed to do now?
- Ok, I'll fix it.

69
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,083
You'd better fucking
clean it up, man!

70
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,681
Regis, we must go,
they're waiting for us.

71
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:13,021
I just gotta go to the bathroom.
You know how it is for girls.

72
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,693
You come back?

73
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,358
One minute.

74
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,700
- At last!
- Here they are.

75
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,704
Okay, great. But look what you did
to my pants!

76
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,717
- I've got just the stuff to fix that.
- Then move your ass!

77
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,932
I've gotta piss too,
I'll be right back.

78
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,191
Give me the key!

79
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,566
Got a light?

80
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,379
- So have you got it?
- Got what?

81
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,092
We've got a problem.

82
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,627
Code red.

83
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,628
Do you hear me?
Code red, I repeat...

84
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,632
...a man is walking
into the ladies room.

85
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,644
Miss Veronica?

86
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,991
Ok baby, baby we gotta go...

87
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,675
Miss Veronica?

88
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,360
Are you alright?

89
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,750
The key's in the bag.

90
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,592
Get moving!

91
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,266
You'd better get out of here.
Go!

92
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,940
They stole the diamonds!

93
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,947
Asshole!
You said no fucking guns!

94
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,291
They switched them
with the real! They're glass!

95
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:17,625
- Where's my fucking passport?
- They're fucking glass!

96
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,466
- You'd better kill me now, bitch!
- Oh, shut the fuck up!

97
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,801
Call security!

98
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,144
You understand...dead!

99
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,140
I repeat...don't move!

100
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,006
Stay where you are!

101
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,668
Don't move!

102
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,011
Don't move or I'll shoot!

103
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,352
Shit...

104
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,693
Hey, Racine!

105
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,040
Racine?

106
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,709
Okay, we're here,
but what's going on?

107
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:47,708
That bitch double crossed us.
She's got the diamonds!

108
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,052
Oh no. Where is she?

109
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,051
In Paris. She's got some girlfriend
in Belleville.

110
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,292
Yeah...

111
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:08,395
No, no. You don't understand.
I need a passport yesterday.

112
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,437
Did you get it?

113
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,111
What is it?

114
00:20:56,822 --> 00:21:00,121
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

115
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,025
Excuse me, madame...

116
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,357
...but I believe this is
a free country.

117
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,126
And I'm entitled to make
any picture of anything...

118
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,469
...and anyone I want
from my balcony.

119
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,806
Go fuck yourself!

120
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,139
Go to church.
Try to save your soul.

121
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,137
Got you!

122
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,821
My darling!

123
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,547
Yes, that's strange.
Yes, it's her.

124
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,895
Do you really think it's her?

125
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,568
Lily!

126
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,907
Wait!

127
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,252
But what is she doing?

128
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,248
Wait for us!

129
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,918
Lily! Wait!

130
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:22,763
- Wait, Lily!
- Charles De Gaulle. Hotel Sheraton.

131
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,762
Go and get the car.

132
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,639
What do you want?

133
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,573
Don't move!

134
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,912
Stay put! Right!

135
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,240
Take off your glasses...

136
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,914
Good. The light is perfect.

137
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,918
- Brought the money?
- Of course!

138
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,922
- Perfect for what?
- I need a picture for the passport.

139
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:08,929
I got you, fucking bitch!

140
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,598
Come on!

141
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:14,932
Before I snap
your double-crossing neck...

142
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,935
...just tell me one thing.

143
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,605
Where are...

144
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,274
...the diamonds?

145
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,616
Pay back time, bitch!

146
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,303
Oh my god!

147
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,308
Don't touch her!

148
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:21,502
- Are you preparing the tea?
- Yes, of course.

149
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,837
Forget it!

150
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,179
- We should have done something.
- It's none of our business.

151
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,509
Oh right, you read two words
and she falls apart.

152
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,512
People die and
wills have to be read.

153
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,520
Did you see the look on her face?
And her hair?

154
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,524
- What has she done with her hair?
- I'm just a notary, damn it!

155
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,861
What if the kids and I were killed?
Would you give a damn what I left you?

156
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:51,091
When your gun disappeared,
I knew she would do something crazy.

157
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,864
- How do you know she stole it?
- Who else?

158
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,199
Go check on the tea.

159
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,212
Feeling better, Lily?

160
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,878
Excuse me,
but I don't understand...

161
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,881
Now, you just shut up, honey,
save your strenght.

162
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,883
You just have to rest.

163
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,559
You have suffered
a terrible tragedy...

164
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,559
...and you need time to get better,
you know.

165
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:23,890
And if you get the urge to do anything
silly, I want you to call me.

166
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,232
Before we leave...

167
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,243
I want you to answer
just one question.

168
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:37,244
Did you borrow Louis's gun?

169
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,253
Are you sure?

170
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:50,261
Okay, but if you come across it,
you'll tell me, won't you?

171
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:53,594
Good.

172
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,597
I'll turn the TV on
so you'll have company.

173
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:06,106
We'll be back tonight
with some dinner.

174
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,450
Drink your tea while it's hot.

175
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,472
Holly shit!

176
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,480
Ah, my god!

177
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,980
And if you could see the future
in a crystal ball...

178
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:53,316
...or in the palm of your hand,
or in a dream...

179
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,986
...would you change it?

180
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,665
So what should one think
of these phenomenon?

181
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,334
How can they be explained?

182
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,337
Is it really possible
to receive messages...

183
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:13,670
...from what one might call
the "hereafter"...

184
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:20,010
Could one be unconsciously gifted
with a perception power...

185
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,684
...which would allow us...

186
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,731
"I thought I could start over
in America.

187
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,900
My English is not so good,
but I'm a fast learner.

188
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,068
I even bought myself a ticket
but I lost it.

189
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,237
I can't live without
Thierry and Brigitte.

190
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,736
Forgive me, my God.
Allow us to be together again."

191
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,882
There's been a mistake. The computer
has sold the same seat twice.

192
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,889
I'm terribly sorry.

193
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,886
Could we accommodate you
in our first class cabin?

194
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,898
This way please.
It's right here.

195
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,077
Excuse me.

196
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,782
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

197
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:29,793
I'm sorry I woke you up.

198
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:35,458
You fell asleep here.
Are you OK?

199
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,463
I didn't mean to frighten you.
I'm sorry. Are you OK?

200
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,466
I'm sorry.

201
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,802
Do you speak French?

202
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,145
- I'm sorry.
- Are you American?

203
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:51,811
California.

204
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,143
I mean I grew up
in California...

205
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,145
...but I live in Washington now.

206
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,984
- What do you do in life?
- In life?

207
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,322
Well, I started in software.

208
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,498
And made some money...

209
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:15,172
...and found out that
I was interested in other things.

210
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,501
Like what things?

211
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,406
Well, like the whole world...

212
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,514
I went back to school
in Washington,

213
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,510
I got a degree in Foreign Relations.
I taught for a little while...

214
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:31,184
...and then I got a posting
at the State Department.

215
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:37,527
America is a country
very big, no?

216
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,866
Very big.
Is this your first trip?

217
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,204
I begin my new life there.

218
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,533
France is no good for me.

219
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,870
How can you say that?
France is a fabulous country.

220
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,547
Really. That's the...
Queen of Europe to me.

221
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,542
The art, the history...

222
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:03,546
...the sense of language,
Stendhal, Racine, Balzac...

223
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,220
I lost my baby there...

224
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,903
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.

225
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,231
That's terrible.

226
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,908
Please forgive me.

227
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,571
It's OK. It's OK.

228
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,575
That is just awful.

229
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,444
Hi! Mister Bardo is not here
at the moment.

230
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:04,110
What are you doing?
Trying to dodge bill collectors?

231
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,449
- Nick, it's Johnny.
- I know who you are.

232
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,341
- What are you doing?
- Working.

233
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:11,784
- Something I can sell?
- Could be. I just need one more piece.

234
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,787
Another shot of that table?
What's happen' to you?

235
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,127
- Are you eating?
- Barely.

236
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:20,463
How would you like a break from your
masterwork and make some real money?

237
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:24,297
- What are you selling?
- You know who Bruce Hewitt Watts is?

238
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:28,635
As strange as it may seem to you, Jean,
photographers actually read.

239
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,865
You know books, magazines,
and even daily newspapers.

240
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,636
All right, all right, smart ass,
who is he?

241
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,643
- The new American ambassador?
- Bingo.

242
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,984
He's got a wife but no one seems
to have a picture of her.

243
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,878
- Maybe she's camera shy.
- No, she's not camera shy.

244
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:46,990
She's got a past and
she's not talking about it.

245
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,326
And I did some checking and
found out she's really French.

246
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,320
Married before
with a kid.

247
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,994
I've got an ex I don't talk about
either. What's wrong with that?

248
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,564
Nothing except that
you don't dodge photographers...

249
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:59,328
...like you've got something
to hide.

250
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,999
- So you want me to nail her, right?
- You are the best.

251
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:08,000
I don't like to do this.
I feel like shit.

252
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:11,678
- And besides, I am retired.
- On what? IOUs?

253
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:15,348
I'm not just your agent Nicolas,
I'm your bank and you're way past due.

254
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:19,348
Do yourself a favour and go to work.
I can get 5 figures for this picture.

255
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,858
All right. What's her schedule?

256
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,861
She arrives
by private jet tonight.

257
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:33,529
- I gotta go, I gotta go. Bye.
- Take that picture.

258
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,729
Be careful. You almost fell!

259
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,565
Where are you going?

260
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:07,734
Let's see if you understand me.
Listen, I'm looking for public toilets.

261
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,073
The Champs Elysées are
over there or over here?

262
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:19,738
I'd like to go to the public toilets
which are in that direction. Please.

263
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:25,081
If you understand me,
in that direction...

264
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,614
And thanks for the ride!

265
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,499
Can we jump in?

266
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:58,571
Nice wheels!

267
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:02,014
What did you expect?
I only steal the best!

268
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,853
- Is this Nicolas Bardo?
- Speaking.

269
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,026
You took a picture
of Mrs. Watts?

270
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:13,689
Who wants to know?

271
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:16,362
Leonard Shiff.
Head of Watts' security.

272
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:18,694
I'd like to buy it.

273
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:23,369
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Shiff,
but it's already been sold.

274
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:27,036
Unsell it. We'll double
whatever you've got.

275
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:30,603
That's very generous but I...

276
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:33,045
I don't think you realize
who you're dealing with, Mr. Bardo.

277
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:36,386
We know all about you,
your overdrawn bank account...

278
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:39,051
...your criminal record.
I suggest...

279
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:42,054
...you get that picture back
and you bring it to me...

280
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:45,387
...at the residence tomorrow
morning 11a.m. sharp.

281
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:50,389
- Don't keep me waiting.
- Sir, hold on! Hello!

282
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,237
Nice going, man. Really.

283
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:58,237
Thanks for keeping your mouth shut.

284
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,575
They must have offered you
some sweet deals to talk?

285
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,248
There was nothing
to talk about.

286
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:11,584
They just asked about the diamonds,
of which I knew shit.

287
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,251
Once the insurance paid off,
they stopped asking.

288
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:20,597
Don't worry, man!
That bitch knows.

289
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:24,263
I thought about her
every fucking minute...

290
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:29,936
...every fucking hour,
for seven fucking years!

291
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:34,277
Where is she?

292
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,945
I've been looking. I talked to
everyone, I never stopped.

293
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:47,583
I ran down every scumbag
that ever knew her.

294
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:49,959
She just vanished off
the face of the earth?

295
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:52,625
Hey, I'm not Interpol, alright!

296
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:55,632
I've been fucked same as you!

297
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:59,302
I did a hell of a lot
of checking!

298
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:04,300
I've got one thing,
maybe, one thing...

299
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,646
You know that girlfriend of hers?

300
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:11,974
The brunette...

301
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:17,980
She's fencing diamonds.
It's all I've got.

302
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:44,010
Wait, wait.

303
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,342
Excuse me, officer...

304
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:51,414
There is less and less sun.

305
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:04,420
Let's wait for the sun.

306
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,020
Park Bardo in the office
until I can get...

307
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,025
Hold on a second.

308
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:05,711
I don't believe it. This paparazzi scum
is wearing a wire.

309
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:12,714
Make sure he doesn't get
passed security.

310
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:24,396
Hold on...

311
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:30,736
- Can you help me, please?
- One minute, pal.

312
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,110
Damn it! Damn it!

313
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:56,772
Oh shit!

314
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:11,790
- Is the bar open?
- Yes of course, sir.

315
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:15,464
But you can't stay there.
Please move your bike.

316
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,295
- You can't leave it there.
- I know, I know.

317
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,807
- Please...
- Okay.

318
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:34,206
Hi! I'm sorry to bother you but
I rented this room last night...

319
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:36,545
...and I think I left my disk here.

320
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,548
- A disk?
- When I got home...

321
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:42,544
I checked my laptop,
and the backup disk was gone!

322
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:46,882
It's the only copy I have and I've been
searching like hell for it.

323
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:51,549
Then I remembered the only place
I could have left it was...here.

324
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,123
So did you mind if I come in
and just take a look around?

325
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,892
- I don't think it's a good idea...
- Thank you very much.

326
00:58:58,268 --> 00:58:59,735
I appreciate it.

327
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,237
Thank you.

328
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,236
Oh my God, I got so much information
in that disk.

329
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:14,250
You didn't see a disk right?
I mean, actually it's not a disk.

330
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:16,585
It's not like a CD or a DVD
or anything like that...

331
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:20,912
...it's called floppy. It's a black thing
that you introduce in the computer.

332
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:25,261
I am remembering now
that I put it there...

333
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:29,257
...'cause I was working in bed.
I just love to work in bed.

334
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:33,094
I bet you do too.
Anyway, let me...

335
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:36,101
Let just remember
exactly what I did.

336
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:38,433
I sat over here.

337
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:43,006
I sat over here and I put it on my lap,
because it's a laptop...

338
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:45,114
...and I just plugged it
over there and...

339
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:48,780
Actually, you know what had happened?
What happened is that I wasn't alone.

340
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:51,112
I wasn't alone and then...

341
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:55,116
Oh my God!

342
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:58,123
That's not your business.

343
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:01,122
Well, ah...No, it's not.

344
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:04,133
It's not but it is.

345
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:06,461
Because...

346
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:08,133
Excuse me...

347
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,303
Are you alright?

348
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:18,647
I think I can help you.

349
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:20,983
I have been working in a hospital
for a couple of years and...

350
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:24,320
I was a kind of a candy striper myself.
Just sit down over here.

351
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:27,986
Give me your arms. Put them up.
Just like this and...Relax! Relax!

352
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:30,326
And breathe, breathe and relax.

353
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,321
And now listen to me.
Good.

354
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:37,659
I know, because I have been accused of
having an overactive imagination...

355
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:40,332
...but when a classy woman
like yourself...

356
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:43,331
...checks into an airport hotel,
in the middle of the morning...

357
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:47,005
...with a bunch of bullets and a gun,
there's only one word that follows.

358
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,511
What word?

359
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:50,679
"Bang".

360
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:54,346
Now, if a guy walks in...

361
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:57,015
...maybe there doesn't have
to be a "bang".

362
01:00:57,387 --> 01:00:59,355
Maybe there is something
to talk about?

363
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:03,021
Coffee?

364
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:09,187
Maybe we should have start
with some introductions?

365
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:12,534
I don't care who you are.

366
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:15,534
And I definitely don't want
you to know who I am.

367
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,873
All right, that's fair enough.

368
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:19,868
Let's call me...
"Harry"...

369
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:24,213
...and let's start with the shiner.

370
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:26,875
Who's beating you up?

371
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:32,221
- Must we talk about this?
- Yes.

372
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:35,887
Or we're gonna find
the local police station...

373
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:38,227
...and we're gonna talk
about it there.

374
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,228
- My husband.
- All right, why?

375
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:51,573
He has...

376
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:55,741
...difficulty to control
his temper.

377
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:01,083
Why does he lose it?

378
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:04,746
Because I can't live
with him here.

379
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:10,759
- Why not?
- I have a past here.

380
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:15,097
I was safe in the States
but here...

381
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:18,434
...it only takes one photo...

382
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:26,434
Like the one today?

383
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,112
I took that picture.

384
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:45,787
So "Harry" is Nicolas Bardo.

385
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:51,797
Why did you follow me,
to get more photos?

386
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:54,462
No, no, I...

387
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:58,807
I just came to tell
your security goon, Mr. Shiff...

388
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:02,478
...that I couldn't stop the picture
from being published. I'm sorry.

389
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:06,144
Anyone can see that.
You've wasted your time.

390
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:15,157
This espresso is cold.

391
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,826
- Can I get you another cup?
- Why?

392
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,163
There's nothing more to say.

393
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,500
Can I go now?
You have the gun.

394
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,499
Sex Shops are open all day.

395
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:30,506
I don't think I'll be going to one.

396
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,835
How can I be sure?

397
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:38,173
Just stay with me.

398
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:42,514
I need air but I don't want
to talk anymore.

399
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:52,691
Good...
So where is she?

400
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:55,364
The ambassador is
extremely worried.

401
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:59,030
The police? God, no.

402
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:02,033
Keep calling Shiff...

403
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:41,573
Right when I got divorced,
I just decided to leave Spain...

404
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:44,913
...and come here to Paris to prevent
myself...kind of think, you know...

405
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:47,916
I mean I've got these crazy
photographer ideas...

406
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:51,246
...and don't think for a second that
I am a paparazzi. I hate them.

407
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:54,590
I feel like shit but I have to make
some money. That's the only way...

408
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:56,925
But...There is
a square here in Paris...

409
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,259
...full of coffee shops, beautiful,
and there is one in particular...

410
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,929
...in a corner, you know,
with these light reflections...

411
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,268
...and I saw something
that changed my life...

412
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:09,605
- It's a great story, Nicolas.
- This is the best part!

413
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:11,940
I know. I know.
Maybe another time.

414
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:16,274
It's a great story
but right now I'm...

415
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,610
...very tired and I would just like to
take a warm bath and relax a little...

416
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:26,284
...before I go home, OK?
Thank you for today.

417
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:29,617
I'll be waiting out here...
Just in case you need anything...

418
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:35,290
- You don't trust me, do you?
- No, no, no. It's not that.

419
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:37,959
It's just being careful.

420
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,305
- Are you all right?
- No.

421
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:48,644
- I'm out of my medicine.
- There was a pharmacy in the airport.

422
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:51,313
Oh that's right.

423
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,652
My inhaler is in my car.

424
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:58,980
They can refill it
for me there.

425
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:01,990
That wouldn't be being careful...

426
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:04,993
Nicolas, take my car...

427
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:11,326
...take my purse if you're so
worried that I go somewhere.

428
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:16,171
You can call a taxi,
I don't...

429
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,506
Yes, Nicolas,
I could call a taxi.

430
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:26,181
But I'm not going to do that.

431
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:35,190
I'm not going to need these
in the bath.

432
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:37,518
Hey! Wait.

433
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:42,523
I'm definitely not going anywhere
without them.

434
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:56,207
Are you flirting with me?

435
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,383
Was I?

436
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:06,885
I believe so, yeah.

437
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,726
I didn't mean to.

438
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,729
It's just that...

439
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:19,056
...all your boyhood stories
make you so...

440
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:22,404
...damn lovable.

441
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,742
Was that the point?

442
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:25,467
Hello, is this police?

443
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:29,805
Madre de Dios.
My name is Sophia.

444
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:34,131
I call now from the airport
De Gaulle. Yes, De Gaulle.

445
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:38,810
A man just hit the lady
in front of the pharmacy.

446
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:46,148
Yes, wait a second. Yes, man
is still there, but I see no lady.

447
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:49,154
Yes, he steal her car.

448
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:52,494
No, I can't. No, not possible.
No, sorry.

449
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:55,490
My husband calling me. Sorry.
No, I can't.

450
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:03,895
Is it your car?

451
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:06,667
It's not mine but...
Somebody lend it to me and...

452
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,589
Come in!

453
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,040
Good morning.

454
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,544
You can put it there.

455
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:55,883
- Could you hand me my bag?
-Of course.

456
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:58,226
It's over there by the bed.

457
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:17,412
- I can't find it.
- Maybe on the floor?

458
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:24,419
I'm sorry but I don't see it.

459
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:28,920
This is the gun
we found in the Mercedes.

460
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:31,589
- Any details?
- No, it's not registered.

461
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:35,923
Concerning the car...
It belongs to the American Embassy.

462
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:52,443
This doesn't make much sense.
I'm Chief Inspector Serra.

463
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:55,443
Maybe you can help me out?

464
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:58,112
I said it already.

465
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:01,449
But, OK.
Alright.

466
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:04,455
Mrs. Watts was trying
to kill herself.

467
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:06,961
I stopped her...

468
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:09,460
...so she set me up for you guys,
to get me out of her way.

469
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:12,467
How did you come up with that?

470
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:18,132
I read a lot of mysteries and I just
figure out the endings half way...

471
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:22,033
I put the clues together and
I know what happened, sir.

472
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:24,145
What happened, Mr. Bardo...

473
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:28,142
...was a car belonging to Ambassador
Watts was found in your possession.

474
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:30,144
I know, I know that...

475
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:34,315
On the front seat was
a gun, bullets...

476
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:38,319
...blouse and dress.

477
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:43,328
The only thing missing is the woman.

478
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:47,502
Where is she?

479
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:51,339
I don't know. I don't know...

480
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:55,336
- You checked out the hotel?
- Yeah, we checked the room.

481
01:11:56,378 --> 01:11:58,346
We found a naked waitress
in a coma.

482
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:02,680
Did you have anything
to do with that?

483
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,017
No.

484
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:10,355
I wasn't there.
I was buying an inhaler.

485
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:12,690
Inhaler?

486
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:14,692
Yes...

487
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:20,531
An inhaler. All right?
Mrs. Watts has asthma.

488
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:25,203
So I went to a pharmacy to get
her prescription refilled. That's it.

489
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:32,540
So, you figured...

490
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:37,545
...by having her car and her clothes,
she wasn't going anywhere?

491
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:41,215
That's correct, yeah.

492
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:45,553
And you kept the gun
so she wouldn't shoot herself?

493
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:48,556
That's right.

494
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:51,900
Why would she want to do that?

495
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:58,573
- Excuse me?
- Why would she want to do that?

496
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:03,908
Well, her husband was beating her up
because she wanted to leave him.

497
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,578
The American Ambassador
beats his wife?

498
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:15,583
That's right, that's right, yes.

499
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:18,923
And she has
the face to prove it...

500
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:26,594
You see...

501
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:29,267
I'm kind of
a mystery buff myself.

502
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:33,604
And you know what kind
of mystery this is?

503
01:13:37,312 --> 01:13:38,939
- A kidnapping.
- Oh come on!

504
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,282
Ambassador's wife held
for ransom.

505
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:44,619
Everything was going fine until
someone reported a stolen car.

506
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:48,456
You didn't even have time
to send the ransom note...

507
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:51,285
- ...or did you?
- No. What are you talking about?

508
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:55,630
I am no kidnapper, sir.

509
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:58,296
Why don't we take a ride
down to the Residence...

510
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:00,965
...and see what the Ambassador
has to say about that?

511
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:03,964
I think this is
a terrible misunderstanding.

512
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:06,307
I spoke with Mrs. Watts...

513
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:09,303
...she explained to me how
she let Mr. Bardo use her car.

514
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:12,640
I don't know who reported it stolen
because it wasn't.

515
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:14,983
And my attorney,
Mrs. Phillips...

516
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:17,978
...has indicated to me that
no crime has been committed...

517
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:21,982
...so I'm a little confused as to
what we are doing here, inspector.

518
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:25,653
- You spoke to your wife yourself?
- Yes, I did.

519
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:30,991
- Could I speak with her?
- I don't think that's necessary.

520
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,669
This has been an awkward situation
for all of us concerned...

521
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:37,998
...and I really...
I don't want to prolong it.

522
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:46,177
Mrs. Phillips will have to handle
your questions from now on.

523
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:48,516
I have an engagement.
Please excuse me.

524
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:04,855
Inspector Serra, you've displayed
a boorish lack of sensitivity...

525
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,862
towards the American Ambassador.

526
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:11,869
We do not need or want your
investigative skills employed...

527
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:16,533
...to discover why Mrs. Watts was in
a hotel bedroom with Mr. Bardo.

528
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:21,876
I suggest you return to
your duties and drop this matter.

529
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:25,053
The less said about it the better.

530
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:30,289
I'd still like
to talk to Mrs. Watts.

531
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:35,055
- And what crime has she committed?
- No crime, I just want to see her.

532
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:39,397
Well, I'm sure we all want
to see lots of people...

533
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:43,738
...but fortunately in our country
and in yours...

534
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:47,405
...they are not compelled to see us.

535
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:50,411
Good day, Inspector.

536
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:55,310
Sir!

537
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:58,078
Do you know the penalty for having
an illegal hand gun?

538
01:15:58,453 --> 01:16:01,081
- I told you, it's not my gun.
- OK. Then we'll just keep it.

539
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:04,092
Now, about your motorcycle...

540
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:08,426
- You really want to report it stolen?
- Of course I want to report it stolen.

541
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:10,424
If it wasn't at the hotel,
somebody took it, sir.

542
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:12,426
Why don't you look a little harder?

543
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:14,769
If it doesn't turn up in a few days,
give me a call.

544
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:19,770
Sir, you don't believe one goddamn
thing I said, right?

545
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:23,437
Not only don't I believe you,
I don't even like you.

546
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:26,777
Look, Bardo, I know who you are.

547
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:30,118
Ex-paparazzi smart ass who
hasn't worked for seven years.

548
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:33,447
I don't know what you're up to
but it's not smart.

549
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:36,450
And if you keep it up, you're going
to wind up on a cell block...

550
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:38,793
...full of smart guys just like you.

551
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,248
"Mr. Watts...

552
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:50,921
...if you ever want
to see your wife again...

553
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,587
...bring 10 million dollars...

554
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:56,924
...in Bearer Bonds to
the Passerelle Debilly...

555
01:18:57,632 --> 01:18:59,259
...at 2 a.m. this morning.

556
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:02,937
If you inform the police or arrive
with anyone besides yourself...

557
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:06,934
...she will be killed."

558
01:19:10,645 --> 01:19:12,272
Oh shit.

559
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:19,620
Son of a bitch!

560
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:32,800
Mrs. Watts...

561
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:37,631
Call me Lily.

562
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:40,968
Okay, Lily.

563
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:45,309
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Lily?

564
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:47,975
Are you mad at me?

565
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:50,318
Mad? Nah...

566
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:53,651
You're making everybody think
I've kidnapped you.

567
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:57,651
Haven't you?

568
01:19:58,026 --> 01:19:59,653
That is not funny...

569
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:01,996
No, Nicolas. You're right.
It's not funny.

570
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:05,329
It wasn't funny when you sold my picture
to the papers either.

571
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:08,563
Then you showed up
to do what?

572
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:11,672
Explain, apologize, lie?

573
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:16,503
I was afraid for your life.
I felt responsible for it, damn it!

574
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:19,510
That's so sweet, Nicolas.

575
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:24,852
I'm a bad girl, Nicolas.

576
01:20:26,888 --> 01:20:28,515
Real bad.

577
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:31,526
Rotten to the heart.

578
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:34,855
Last scrape I was in
I fucked up a lot of people.

579
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:38,859
Bad people. People like me.
People that don't forget.

580
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:43,538
But I was given a second chance.

581
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:48,698
So I went back to States where I got
everything a bad girl ever wanted.

582
01:20:50,745 --> 01:20:52,713
Fucking Watts!

583
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:59,042
He was sweet, until being the richest
man in the world wasn't enough.

584
01:21:00,755 --> 01:21:02,723
He had to have public glory.

585
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:05,719
So he gave away
a ton of money...

586
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:08,062
...bought himself
the French Ambassadorship.

587
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:11,729
Which meant the Misses got dragged out
into the Parisian limelight.

588
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:15,062
Well, I couldn't do that Nicolas...

589
01:21:15,437 --> 01:21:17,735
...'cause bad people
read newspapers too.

590
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,067
There you go.

591
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:24,078
Enter my worst nightmare.

592
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,909
You snap that fucking picture,
sell it to the tabloids.

593
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:33,247
And now it's only a matter of time
before those bad people come running.

594
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:39,924
So I got the photographer turned
blackmailer to kidnapped me.

595
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:44,591
Blackmailer?
You offered me money!

596
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:48,603
And I have never kidnapped anybody,
you fucking bitch!

597
01:21:49,638 --> 01:21:51,265
Then where am I, Nicolas?

598
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:56,273
Why did you have my car,
my clothes, a gun?

599
01:21:57,979 --> 01:22:00,948
Why was a ransom note
e-mailed from your computer?

600
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:05,616
- Everyone knows you did it.
- I've got to think. I've got to think.

601
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:08,623
I've got to think.

602
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:11,618
Don't bother.
You don't have to think about anything.

603
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:14,291
I've got it all thought out
for you.

604
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:18,292
Watts is coming up here at 2 a.m.
with 10 million dollars in a briefcase.

605
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,298
Now if you start being
a little nice to me...

606
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:24,305
I might catch you in on the take.

607
01:22:30,011 --> 01:22:31,979
We are going to the police.

608
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:34,315
Why would you want to do that?

609
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:37,644
Because you're gonna tell them
the crazy story you just told me.

610
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:40,985
Nicolas?
You think I'm stupid?

611
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:44,989
I'm going to tell them
a kidnapping story...

612
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:47,494
...starring you.

613
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:51,666
Son of a bitch! Fuck...

614
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:54,331
- Nicolas!
- Hold. Hold on. Hold on.

615
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:57,331
See, I did have time
to go back to that sex shop.

616
01:22:58,039 --> 01:22:59,666
C'mon!

617
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:02,677
What did you do with that other gun
I gave you?

618
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:05,346
- The cops took it.
- They took it?

619
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:10,416
- I got you another one. Come here.
- Be careful with that thing.

620
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:12,179
It's all right.

621
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:21,191
Isn't sugar better than vinegar?

622
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:24,194
Come on.

623
01:23:31,906 --> 01:23:33,874
We've got a couple hours, baby.

624
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:37,541
Let's go do something fun,
want you?

625
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:01,902
How come you're the only man in this
room that doesn't want to fuck me?

626
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:08,238
Nicolas! Where are you going?

627
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:10,805
I'm just going to buy some cigarettes.
And you know...

628
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:12,913
...don't worry,
I'm not going anywhere...

629
01:24:13,281 --> 01:24:15,579
...while you've got my balls
in your pocket, Lily.

630
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:25,259
Pack of cigarettes.
Anything American.

631
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:33,260
22 francs.

632
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:50,117
Hey, Nicolas! Come here!

633
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:52,620
Meet my friend, Napoleon.

634
01:24:53,321 --> 01:24:55,289
I think he is in love.

635
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:59,627
Can we just go outside for a second?
I need to talk to you.

636
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:02,622
Nicolas, com'on we're having fun.
Just be cool.

637
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:04,965
Well, I'm gonna go outside, all right?

638
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:09,292
Nicolas, we don't want you to wait out
in the cold, do we Napoleon?

639
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:12,632
I mean, if we hit it off...

640
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:20,974
I don't know, I was kind of thinking
of letting you off the hook.

641
01:25:21,349 --> 01:25:22,816
- Really?
- Yeah.

642
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:25,315
I mean, you don't seem to be enjoying
my company much.

643
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:29,653
Maybe Napoleon and I should just
sail off into the sunset.

644
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:32,326
And you can go fuck yourself.

645
01:29:22,256 --> 01:29:23,883
I hope you didn't kill him.

646
01:29:25,593 --> 01:29:27,891
He was going to save me
from a dip in the Seine.

647
01:29:28,262 --> 01:29:29,559
What?

648
01:29:29,931 --> 01:29:33,890
We had big plans. I was going off
the bridge into his boat.

649
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:38,068
Oh poor Lily,
whatever happened to her?

650
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:41,067
She must have drowned
and washed out to sea.

651
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:45,079
Thanks a lot,
you've ruined everything.

652
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:50,250
Fuck you.

653
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:59,760
What's the matter, Nicolas?
Did I make you jealous?

654
01:30:00,795 --> 01:30:02,422
Jealous? Yes.

655
01:30:05,133 --> 01:30:07,761
I was jealous.
I am jealous.

656
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:12,766
Come on, Nicolas!
You don't have to lick my ass.

657
01:30:13,474 --> 01:30:14,941
Just fuck me.

658
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:20,940
- You know what?
- What?

659
01:30:21,649 --> 01:30:23,276
We can still go away.

660
01:30:24,986 --> 01:30:26,954
Both of us. Together.

661
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:34,287
That's so sweet.

662
01:30:35,997 --> 01:30:37,624
Come here. Come here.

663
01:30:51,846 --> 01:30:53,473
That's so romantic.

664
01:30:54,849 --> 01:30:56,476
Without the money?

665
01:30:58,853 --> 01:31:00,320
Are you nuts?

666
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:29,683
That's a choice.

667
01:31:31,052 --> 01:31:34,351
A bad choice.
There are other ones.

668
01:31:35,056 --> 01:31:37,354
What? Like doing the right thing?

669
01:31:42,396 --> 01:31:44,364
That's a start.

670
01:31:47,068 --> 01:31:49,036
I tried that once, Nicolas.

671
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:54,367
And you know what it got me?

672
01:31:56,744 --> 01:31:59,042
A lifetime of looking
over my shoulder.

673
01:32:01,749 --> 01:32:04,377
You know why no good deed
goes unpunished?

674
01:32:07,088 --> 01:32:10,717
Because this world is hell and
you're nothing but a fucking patsy.

675
01:32:16,097 --> 01:32:18,395
I made everybody think
you kidnapped me...

676
01:32:18,766 --> 01:32:21,394
...so I could screw my husband
out of 10 million bucks.

677
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:24,063
That's what it's all about...

678
01:32:25,106 --> 01:32:27,734
...me disappearing with
10 million bucks.

679
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:31,408
So...wipe it off...

680
01:32:32,446 --> 01:32:34,073
...and let's go get it.

681
01:32:43,457 --> 01:32:44,754
Fuck you.

682
01:33:05,813 --> 01:33:07,781
You're not gonna hurt her, right?

683
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:10,447
Because I've done exactly
what you told me to do.

684
01:33:13,487 --> 01:33:15,114
I've brought the money...

685
01:33:15,823 --> 01:33:17,791
...and I haven't talked to anyone.

686
01:33:30,004 --> 01:33:32,632
- Don't do anything foolish, darling.
- I won't.

687
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:36,970
He just wants me to take the money
and bring it back to him.

688
01:33:49,357 --> 01:33:51,325
It's Nicolas Bardo.

689
01:33:51,692 --> 01:33:54,661
Your wife is staging this kidnapping
to take you for 10 million bucks.

690
01:33:55,363 --> 01:33:57,661
If you don't believe me,
I got it right here on tape.

691
01:34:04,538 --> 01:34:06,506
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

692
01:34:06,874 --> 01:34:08,501
You killed him?

693
01:34:08,876 --> 01:34:10,503
Just being careful.

694
01:34:24,058 --> 01:34:27,357
That fucking bitch.
She's at it again!

695
01:34:41,742 --> 01:34:43,369
The fucking bitch!

696
01:35:09,437 --> 01:35:12,736
You didn't think I'd give you a gun
loaded with real bullets, did you?

697
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:26,079
Baby, there's one more thing
we gotta do...

698
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:36,760
Oh God, somebody help!
My husband!

699
01:35:41,135 --> 01:35:43,103
Fucking over everyone again!

700
01:35:45,473 --> 01:35:47,771
- How did you find me?
- Not this time.

701
01:35:49,143 --> 01:35:50,440
Where...

702
01:35:51,145 --> 01:35:53,443
...are the diamonds?

703
01:35:57,151 --> 01:35:58,618
Fuck you!

704
01:36:05,826 --> 01:36:07,453
Wake up, bitch...

705
01:36:11,832 --> 01:36:13,459
...before you die.

706
01:39:51,385 --> 01:39:53,012
You know what's in this?

707
01:39:55,723 --> 01:39:59,022
The bullet that is gonna spread
your brains all over that wall.

708
01:40:00,394 --> 01:40:02,362
You know how I know?
Look at me!

709
01:40:04,398 --> 01:40:06,025
I'm your fucking fairy godmother...

710
01:40:07,401 --> 01:40:10,370
...and I just dreamt your future.
And mine too.

711
01:40:11,405 --> 01:40:13,032
And all I know is...

712
01:40:13,407 --> 01:40:15,932
...if there's a snowball chance in hell
that any of that shit happening...

713
01:40:16,076 --> 01:40:18,044
...we're gonna change it right here.

714
01:40:22,082 --> 01:40:23,379
Now, listen.

715
01:40:25,085 --> 01:40:26,950
I know you got a bad break,
but that's history...

716
01:40:27,087 --> 01:40:29,055
...and you'd better fuckin' forget it,
'cause if you can't...

717
01:40:30,424 --> 01:40:32,392
Well, then you may as well go
ahead and pull the trigger.

718
01:40:35,596 --> 01:40:37,564
But if you don't end it here...

719
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:40,567
...and you get your ass
on that plane to America...

720
01:40:41,935 --> 01:40:44,233
...your future will be sitting
right next to you.

721
01:40:46,607 --> 01:40:48,802
His name is Bruce
and he's a really good guy...

722
01:40:48,942 --> 01:40:51,240
...and he's gonna look
into your eyes...

723
01:40:52,279 --> 01:40:53,906
and he's gonna fall in love.

724
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:01,588
And after that
you're on your own.

725
01:41:04,291 --> 01:41:06,259
So what do you say?

726
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,587
Do I pull the trigger...

727
01:41:09,296 --> 01:41:10,923
...or do you get your ass
on that plane...

728
01:41:12,299 --> 01:41:13,926
...and have a wonderful life?

729
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:21,437
How do I know that
you tell the truth?

730
01:41:26,146 --> 01:41:28,114
How do I know there is
a bullet in the chamber?

731
01:42:09,189 --> 01:42:11,487
That sure is pretty.
Where did you get it?

732
01:42:16,864 --> 01:42:19,162
In a curio shop in Belleville.

733
01:42:20,534 --> 01:42:22,832
I got it for my daughter.

734
01:42:23,871 --> 01:42:26,840
I've got a little girl myself.
She'll be ten next June.

735
01:42:28,542 --> 01:42:30,510
Do you remember
the name of the store?

736
01:42:31,211 --> 01:42:32,838
I make a lot of deliveries there.

737
01:42:33,881 --> 01:42:36,509
I'd sure like to get her something
like that for her birthday.

738
01:42:46,393 --> 01:42:48,361
You give this to her.

739
01:42:57,070 --> 01:42:59,368
That's sure nice of you.

740
01:43:01,074 --> 01:43:03,042
She'll just love it.

741
01:43:04,077 --> 01:43:06,045
It's just for a little girl.

742
01:43:06,747 --> 01:43:09,375
When she grows up,
she'll think it's too silly.

743
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:12,378
So just take it
and hang it right there.

744
01:43:14,254 --> 01:43:17,883
So that, when you're
on the road...

745
01:43:20,594 --> 01:43:23,222
...your little girl will always
be with you.

746
01:43:44,618 --> 01:43:47,815
Sir is not at home
at the moment!

747
01:43:47,955 --> 01:43:49,923
What are you doing,
dodging bill collectors?

748
01:43:50,123 --> 01:43:52,591
- I don't understand.
- Nick, asshole, it's Johnny!

749
01:43:52,793 --> 01:43:54,761
- I know who you are.
- What are you doing?

750
01:43:54,962 --> 01:43:57,157
Well just trying to catch
a little lightning in a bottle.

751
01:43:57,297 --> 01:43:59,162
- Are you eating?
- Barely.

752
01:43:59,299 --> 01:44:01,164
How would you like
to make some real money?

753
01:44:01,301 --> 01:44:04,600
- What are you selling, John?
- You know who Bruce Hewitt Watts is?

754
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:07,607
- The new American ambassador?
- Bingo.

755
01:44:08,308 --> 01:44:11,505
He's got this wife and three kids but
no one seems to have a picture of them.

756
01:44:11,645 --> 01:44:13,840
Well, yeah maybe they're camera shy?

757
01:44:13,981 --> 01:44:17,280
There are some people, they like
to keep their home life private.

758
01:44:17,651 --> 01:44:19,516
I know that is weird
but they do.

759
01:44:19,653 --> 01:44:22,622
What's happening to you? D'you found
a fucking god? You owe me, pal.

760
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:25,288
Then I guess I have
to keep on owing you.

761
01:44:25,993 --> 01:44:27,460
That's your half.

762
01:44:27,995 --> 01:44:29,963
There it is a little under
four million.

763
01:44:31,331 --> 01:44:34,630
That's the best I could do.
I had to fence them off one at a time.

764
01:44:35,669 --> 01:44:38,297
Sorry that it took so long but
it was the safest way.

765
01:44:39,673 --> 01:44:41,300
Not bad for a night's work, huh?

766
01:44:42,342 --> 01:44:43,969
You call that work?

767
01:44:46,346 --> 01:44:49,315
Goodbye, Laure. It's best
we don't see each other again.

768
01:45:10,537 --> 01:45:12,505
Gather around for the picture!

769
01:45:45,238 --> 01:45:47,206
Let's wait for the sun.

770
01:48:46,586 --> 01:48:49,885
- Excuse me lady, are you all right?
- It was an accident, it was a terr...

771
01:48:55,262 --> 01:48:57,890
Sorry, I'm just so shook up.

772
01:49:05,272 --> 01:49:07,570
Actually, you look like
you need a drink...

773
01:49:09,609 --> 01:49:10,906
A drink?

774
01:49:11,945 --> 01:49:13,412
Yes. Come on.

775
01:49:21,121 --> 01:49:22,588
I'm sorry...

776
01:49:23,456 --> 01:49:25,083
You look so familiar.

777
01:49:26,459 --> 01:49:28,757
Haven't we met before?
Somewhere?

778
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:31,757
Only in my dreams.
