- You!

951
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,500
- Lassard.
- Why, yes.

952
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:43,500
I'm flattered you recognize me.
I'm not sure where...

953
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,800
- You can't have me!
- I don't want you.

954
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,000
<i>- En garde!
- On what?</i>

955
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,200
You have any last requests?

956
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,700
God! God! Sonny Bono!

957
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:20,400
LASSARD:
Upsy-daisy!

958
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:23,700
Ah-ha!

959
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,600
- You look familiar.
- Don't play with me, Lassard.

960
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,300
- Was it Paris?
- No, not Paris.

961
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,600
- Rome?
- Not Rome.

962
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,100
You think you can play me the fool?

963
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,500
<i>Ol!</i>

964
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,400
You'll never take me, Lassard!

965
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,200
Not Konstantine Konali!

966
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,400
Ah! I remember you now.

967
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:57,500
You're under arrest
for crimes against Russia...

968
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:01,700
...and America and their citizens!
Ha!

969
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,500
[APPLAUSE]

970
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,500
Do it!

971
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:21,100
- Today...
- Today, today.

972
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,800
...we have shown...
JONES: We have shown, we have shown.

973
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,500
Hm.

974
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:33,000
...people everywhere...
- People everywhere...

975
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:39,000
...that Americans and Russians
are brothers.

976
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:44,800
I honor you and your team.

977
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,500
Would Commandant Lassard
please join me at podium?

978
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,700
Comrade.

979
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:11,400
And now, as a special tribute
to our American friends...

980
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:14,000
...I salute you all.

981
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:15,400
