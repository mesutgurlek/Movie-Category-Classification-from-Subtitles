1
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:44,391
- Yo, run the ball, fool!
- Come on, now.

2
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:46,829
That's good. Good.
Do it.

00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:43,174

<i>Welcome to the</i> WBGO Journal.
<i>I'm Doug Doyle</i>.

5
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,944
- Hey, Vicky.
- How you doing, Miss Jenkins?

6
00:03:47,114 --> 00:03:48,445
I'm good, girl.

7
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:52,080
- No.
- No, you can't do that.

8
00:03:59,393 --> 00:04:01,293
It's the man, right here.

9
00:04:03,197 --> 00:04:04,994
- Five-0 say freeze!
- All right.

10
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,565
- Good seeing you, man.
- What's up, guys?

11
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:10,568
- How you doing, baby?
- Not good as you, D.

12
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:13,138
How come nobody around here
ever calls me "baby"?

13
00:04:13,307 --> 00:04:16,174
- How you doing, baby?
- I'm doing good.

14
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:18,573
So, ladies, you seen
your brother Rafik anywhere?

15
00:04:18,746 --> 00:04:20,611
What did he do now?

16
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:23,181
- Hey, Big Daddy.
- Rev, you good, man?

17
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,409
When you gonna
install these refrigerators?

18
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:28,817
We had to lock two boneheads up
last night for breaking in these crates.

19
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:32,288
Yeah, besides, some kid tries to
play house, could end up suffocated.

20
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:35,394
The maintenance fellow is on strike.
What am I supposed to do?

21
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:36,790
Put them in myself?

22
00:04:36,964 --> 00:04:40,058
Lorenzo, you know those laptops
we ordered for the Rainbow Club?

23
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:43,931
- They didn't come with power cords.
- Talk to your housing manager here.

24
00:04:44,104 --> 00:04:46,902
- How we supposed to use them?
- Ladies, tell Rafik to find me...

25
00:04:47,074 --> 00:04:49,804
...before I find him, all right?
- All right.

26
00:04:50,344 --> 00:04:51,936
Lorenzo?

27
00:04:57,184 --> 00:04:59,243
I need for you to have
a man-to-man with Billy.

28
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,910
About what?

29
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,288
He started hitting me.

30
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:04,981
Can you believe that?

31
00:05:06,994 --> 00:05:08,484
You scared?

32
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:15,400
All right. I'll sit his dumb ass down
and talk to him, okay?

33
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,535
Thank you.

34
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:19,798
- Yo, Rev, I'm out, babe.
- All right, baby.

35
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:22,533
- Good seeing you, bro.
- All right, baby.

36
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,611
Oh, Rafik. Just the knucklehead
I was looking for.

37
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:27,474
Right here, son.

38
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:29,275
Come on down.

39
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,475
You know what this is?

40
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:35,045
- A warrant.
- No. It's a Gannon warrant.

41
00:05:35,222 --> 00:05:36,712
You didn't show for your hearing.

42
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,915
Hearing for what,
driving while black?

43
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:42,824
- Can you talk to him tonight? Please.
- Okay, okay. I'm gonna do it, all right?

44
00:05:44,998 --> 00:05:48,627
Did you or did you not get stopped
in that town at 2 a. M...

45
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:50,667
...got a nickel bag of weed on you?

46
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:52,271
- A nickel bag?
- What you doing...

47
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,964
...cruising through Gannon
in the middle of the night?

48
00:05:55,142 --> 00:05:58,805
I was going home, son. Doing
the speed limit and everything. DWB.

49
00:05:59,346 --> 00:06:02,008
You know how those rookies over
in Gannon are. They stop me.

50
00:06:02,182 --> 00:06:04,582
- So you know.
- Hey, hey, hey. Don't try to relate.

51
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:07,448
First of all, lose the weed.
Now, they doing us a favor...

52
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:10,590
...letting us bring you in so your
booking will go smooth, feel me?

53
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:14,057
- I feel you.
- Jesus, I hate this fucking place.

54
00:06:14,995 --> 00:06:18,123
I am not gonna take any shit
for hopping the fence this time either.

55
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:20,266
No, it's cool. I'll handle it.

56
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:23,568
Rev, Bobby. Big Daddy,
how you be?

57
00:06:23,737 --> 00:06:25,534
Well, same old, same old.
What's up?

58
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:28,766
Thought you said you guys were
gonna grab Rafik Dotson for us.

59
00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:31,137
I did. And we will.

60
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,178
Hey. He said we would do it.

61
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:39,479
Yeah, no, no. We're not here for him.
We're picking us up...

62
00:06:39,653 --> 00:06:41,382
...a Calvin Joy.

63
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:45,686
You know, you guys are supposed
to contact the local officers...

64
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,121
...before you come in here.

65
00:06:48,162 --> 00:06:50,392
Rev, I just did.

66
00:06:56,303 --> 00:06:58,294
I'm gonna go up with them.

- Y'all see anything out here?
- No.

No. No, I ain't seen nothing.

- No.

How you ladies doing?

89
00:08:47,114 --> 00:08:49,275
Putting on some weight
there, Lorenzo.

90
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:51,178
Just more of me to love.

- Young man yourself.

92

She good to talk?

I need you to put these in...

95
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:02,189
You say black. Black like
darker than him, lighter than him?

96
00:09:02,362 --> 00:09:04,296
I don't know. It was night.

97
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:08,264
Five-eight, 5'10",
running about 150.

98
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:10,767
- You still feel that?
- Yeah.

99
00:09:10,938 --> 00:09:12,166
Guys?

100
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:14,034
Brenda, this is Detective Council.

101
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:16,141
Detective Council,
this is Brenda Martin.

102
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:20,512
- How you doing, Brenda?
- Not good.

103
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,783
Detective Council's gonna
take it from here, okay?

104
00:09:30,257 --> 00:09:33,090
- Can I get you anything?
- No.

105
00:09:34,761 --> 00:09:35,989
Now, look.

106
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,332
I know you're upset and tired as hell,
but the sooner we go through this...

107
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,526
...the sooner we can make
something good happen, all right?

108
00:09:47,374 --> 00:09:50,502
Look, Brenda, would you rather have
a female investigator in here?

109
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:52,338
Would that make you
more comfortable?

110
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:55,413
I wasn't raped,
if that's what you're driving at.

111
00:09:56,283 --> 00:09:59,684
Oh, that's good.
I'm real glad to hear that.

112
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:03,379
Look, the other officers already,
you know...

113
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:05,684
...got the description of the car
and the actor.

114
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:08,384
And everybody's on the street
looking for this guy.

115
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:11,530
But if you'll just bear with me,
you know, kind of...

116
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:15,197
...take me through the story
one more time.

117
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:21,166
I was trying to get from the projects
back into Gannon. I live in Gannon.

118
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:22,933
You shut up! And shut up now!

119
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,079
I was on Hurley at
the bottom of the hill, you know...

120
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,742
...Martyrs Park, where the street ends?
And I had heard you could...

121
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,047
...cut through Martyrs
and come out in Gannon...

122
00:10:36,223 --> 00:10:37,781
...but I'd never done it before.

123
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,358
So I'm, like, halfway in,
and it's, like, where's..?

124
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:43,519
And then there's no road.
So I was starting to back out...

125
00:10:43,697 --> 00:10:46,029
...and this guy come from
behind a tree or something.

126
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:48,793
And I didn't wanna deal with him.
But before I...

127
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:50,903
I know it,
he comes up to the window.

128
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:54,073
And he opens my car door...

129
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:57,142
...and says, "Just... Just look.
Look where I'm pointing."

130
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,609
Like I should get out of the car.
And I know better.

131
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:02,908
Before I knew it, he yanks me
out of the car.

132
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,573
And he pulls me down so hard.

133
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:09,313
You don't know. I tried.
I tried to tell him.

134
00:11:11,224 --> 00:11:12,714
Tried to tell him what, Brenda?

135
00:11:14,895 --> 00:11:16,692
Okay, look. Now, I gotta ask.

136
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,696
And I want you to know,
it doesn't matter what your answer is...

137
00:11:19,866 --> 00:11:22,767
...all I'm concerned with is trying
to find the guy who hurt you.

138
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:26,463
White girl from Gannon. What was I
doing there at night, copping rock?

139
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,165
You're strictly the victim.
I need to know who to hit on.

140
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:31,867
I'm clean almost five years.
I don't even think about it.

141
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:33,307
Okay.

142
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,244
- And my brother's on the job.
- Really? Where?

143
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,577
Gannon. He's a detective.
Danny Martin.

144
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:42,021
Danny Martin.

145
00:11:43,123 --> 00:11:44,818
Yeah, okay. All right. Yeah, good.

146
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,726
What was I doing there
if I wasn't buying drugs?

147
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:50,454
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

148
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:54,592
I work in the Children's Center.
The Rainbow Club in Three Building.

149
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:57,134
Okay, good. That's good.
Now, excuse me.

150
00:11:58,138 --> 00:12:01,266
- This is SI 15 to Base.
<i>- Base. Go ahead</i>.

151
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:05,472
I need a reach-out to Gannon,
a Detective Danny Martin.

152
00:12:05,645 --> 00:12:08,136
Have him contact me
at the Dempsy MC.

153

<i>- Received</i>.
- Okay, Brenda.

154
00:12:10,617 --> 00:12:12,778
I went home
and I couldn't find my glasses.

155
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:15,444
I thought I left them
at the Rainbow Club.

156
00:12:15,622 --> 00:12:19,524
But I didn't, so I got
in the car...

157
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:21,217
...and I drove.

158
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:24,388
You drove, and?

159
00:12:24,564 --> 00:12:26,361
I told you the rest.

160
00:12:28,468 --> 00:12:30,698
You know, Brenda, I...

161
00:12:30,871 --> 00:12:33,806
I can't help but think there's
something else still bothering you.

162
00:12:33,974 --> 00:12:36,943
You sure you don't want
a female investigator here?

163
00:12:41,915 --> 00:12:44,941
Do you know the guy
who did this to you, Brenda?

164
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:54,484
Hey, hey, hey.
Brenda, stop, stop, stop.

165
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,523
Do you know who this man is?

166
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:02,364
Listen, this is your lucky night.

167
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:05,266
I know everybody
in the Armstrong projects.

168
00:13:05,438 --> 00:13:08,430
I own that place.
Ain't nobody I don't know.

169

Do you know who did this to you?
Who's the guy, Brenda?

170
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:16,442
I'm dying. I'm dying! I'm dying!

171
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:20,112
My son.

172
00:13:20,287 --> 00:13:22,847
Your son? Your son what?

173
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,084
Is in the car.

174
00:13:28,228 --> 00:13:31,129
No! No!

Brenda, your kid,
he's a boy, right?

178
00:13:44,945 --> 00:13:46,276
- How old?
- Four.

- Cody.

180

Oh, that's right. Slow down, Lorenzo,

- Okay. Is he in a car seat?
- No.

- Seat belt?
- No.

184

- Of?

Okay. Hold on, hold on.
Hold on one second.

Hold on, hold on.
The child is or was asleep...

195

visible to pursuing officers.

- I tried to tell him.

197
00:14:34,628 --> 00:14:37,859
What was he wearing, Brenda?
What's he wearing? Your son.

198
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:39,760
What is your son wearing?

199

He had a... He had a...

...and long in black...
Back!

Pajama bottoms with stripes. Okay.
All right, hold on, hold on.

Shit! Special Investigator 15

Child has black hair, white shirt

- Your kid's asleep, right, Brenda?
- He's asleep.

209

All right. Okay, now...

...listen to me. This knucklehead,
all he wants is your car.

211
00:15:16,936 --> 00:15:19,427
If he wanted to hurt somebody,
he would have hurt you.

212
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:22,632
- No, he did hurt me.
- All right. Here, listen to me, Brenda.

213
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:26,336
He's gonna see that kid, pull over to
a corner and put him on the sidewalk.

214
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:28,481
He don't want no parts of that kid.

215
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:36,248
Shit! All right. Now listen,
I gotta ask you one more time.

216
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:39,187
- What were you doing there?
- No, I... I told you.

217
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:41,190
- Why were you there?
- I told you.

218
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:42,988
- Well, tell me again!
- I told you.

219
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:45,688
Told me what? Tell me what
you were doing! Tell me again!

220
00:15:45,865 --> 00:15:47,355
I went to find my glasses.

221
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:49,729
You took your sick kid
out at 9 in the evening...

222
00:15:49,903 --> 00:15:53,236
...for some fucking glasses?!
- I... I don't have a babysitter!

223
00:15:53,406 --> 00:15:56,432
I can't afford one. What
are you trying to do, punish me?

224
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:59,100
- Sit. All right. Sit.
- Believe me, you don't have to.

225
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,906
I'm tight. I'm tight. All right?

226
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:03,541
- Oh, God.
- Oh, well, what if he wakes up?

227
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:05,844
He'll be so scared.
I'm never not there for him.

228
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:10,422
Listen, I know this is hard for you.
But we are going to find him, okay?

229
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,683
- I let him down.
- Nobody wants a kidnap tag.

230
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:17,262
He's my world, and I let him down.
He's worth 10 of anybody else.

231
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,799
He's worth 10 of me!
What..? What are you doing?

232
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:25,199
Adrenaline. Straight, no chaser.

233
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:29,372
Detective Council, there's a Detective
Martin from Gannon out here.

234
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:31,100
All right. Can you stay with her?

235
00:16:31,277 --> 00:16:33,973
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay. Be back. Be right back.

236
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:42,985
Is that your daughter?

237
00:16:44,924 --> 00:16:46,391
She's beautiful.

238
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,754
What happened?

239
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:54,593
Your sister got jacked
over in the Armstrong Houses.

240
00:16:54,768 --> 00:16:56,167
She got a little roughed up.

241
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:59,567
And we think her son, Cody,
is still in the back seat of the car.

242
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:02,435
- Car? The guy's still out there?
- We got a crash alert going.

243
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:03,633
He won't get far.

244
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,473
- Where in Armstrong, high end or low?
- I know where you're coming from...

245
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:10,582
...but your sister needs to be
with family. Think you could stay?

246
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,413
- I'll ask you again. High end or low?
- It's not your jurisdiction, man.

247
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:17,416
But I give you my word, I will do...

248
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:21,418
Hey, Council. You at least got
a photo of who you're looking for?

249
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:24,495
Ain't that many pictures
of jackers in the book.

250
00:17:24,664 --> 00:17:27,861
No. I mean him.

251
00:17:35,775 --> 00:17:40,644
- SI 15 to SI 20. Go to six.
<i>- Twenty on six</i>.

252
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:45,648
She had to go to the john.

253
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:49,118
What part of "stay with her"
did you not understand?

254
00:17:50,356 --> 00:17:52,017
What's happening, Big Daddy?

255
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:54,854
<i>Big heads up</i>.
<i>The vic is Danny Martin's sister</i>.

256

hopping the fence in force.

257
00:17:57,897 --> 00:18:00,730
No shit. They're already here.

258

<i>I'll be down as soon as I can</i>.

259
00:18:03,336 --> 00:18:05,736
No. No, don't come down here.
You'll only go batshit.

260
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:08,169
You'll make everything
10 times worse.

261
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:12,801
Listen, just take her over to BCI,
all right? And I'll handle this, please.

262
00:18:15,148 --> 00:18:16,547
Brenda?

263
00:18:24,524 --> 00:18:26,719

And I'm telling you, you cannot
get involved with all this and help her.

285
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:48,759
Now get the hell out of here. Take her
over to BCI and do your job, man.

Yeah. And you,
are you out of your mind?

00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:28,457
And we're gonna shut this place
down like East fucking Berlin...

302
00:22:28,634 --> 00:22:31,194
...until somebody gives it up.
Now, all I want to know...

303
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,134
...is are you working Armstrong
or just protecting it?

304
00:22:37,043 --> 00:22:40,103
<i>The police are requesting</i>
<i>your help with any information...</i>

305
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:42,406
Get him out of here.
Get all of them out of here.

306
00:22:42,582 --> 00:22:46,040
Lorenzo, it's his nephew. Reverse the
situation, we'd be over there in a shot.

307
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:48,687
For an Armstrong kid?
I fucking doubt it.

308
00:22:48,855 --> 00:22:51,119
Don't kill me!

309
00:22:51,858 --> 00:22:53,985
- Oh, God!
- Don't do it, Calvin!

310
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,151
- Don't do it.
- Do it.

311
00:22:56,729 --> 00:22:57,957
Coming through.

312
00:22:58,131 --> 00:23:00,656
- Make way, people.
- Calvin! No, Calvin. No!

313
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,426
Yo, C! Come on, man!

314
00:23:04,036 --> 00:23:05,367
No!

315
00:23:05,538 --> 00:23:08,371
- They threw him out the window.
- They pushed him out the window.

316
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:11,032
- All right, stand back.
- Back up, y'all. Back up.

317
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,804
- Calvin Joy. Possession with intent.
- What did you do, huh?

318
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,948
- What did you do?
- We never got in the door.

319
00:23:16,115 --> 00:23:18,640
Three knocks, this nitwit pulls
a Monte Cristo. Fuck you.

320
00:23:18,818 --> 00:23:21,514
Fuck me? You son of a bitch!
I'll show you "fuck you"!

321
00:23:21,687 --> 00:23:23,382
Son of a bitch! I'll kill you.

322
00:23:27,226 --> 00:23:29,091
Fuck you! Fuck you!

323
00:23:29,262 --> 00:23:30,957
- I'm taking you off this one.
- Don't.

324
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,223
- I'm taking you off!
- Don't, lieutenant, don't.

325
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:36,698
- Armstrong is mine.
- No, she's yours!

326
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:38,860
What's wrong with you,
bringing her back here?

327
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:40,562
Get her looking at mug shots yet?

328
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,503
- No.
- You sit her with a sketch artist?

329
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:43,835
She's yours!

330
00:23:45,244 --> 00:23:47,678
- I love him so much.
- Come on, come on.

331
00:23:47,847 --> 00:23:50,475
Come on, Big Daddy, chill out.
Come on.

332
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,915
- I love him so much.
- I know you do, Brenda. I know you do.

333
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:57,886
I wish... I wish...

334
00:23:58,057 --> 00:24:02,084
I still wanna work here. I wanna...
I wanna work harder.

335
00:24:02,261 --> 00:24:04,092
I have so much love in me.

336
00:24:04,263 --> 00:24:06,356
I know you do, Brenda.
I know you do.

337
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:11,595
- What do I do? What do I do?
- Thanks, ladies. Let's go, Brenda.

338
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,074
All right. Everybody
make room, please.

339
00:24:16,242 --> 00:24:19,507
- What's wrong with you?
- You are two heartbeats from a lockup.

340
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:20,976
You're gonna lock me up now?

341
00:24:21,147 --> 00:24:22,637
Take me now, and lock me up.

342
00:24:22,815 --> 00:24:24,715
Lock me up.
That's what you should do...

343
00:24:24,884 --> 00:24:26,977
...you old hillbilly-ass cracker!

344
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,122
Can't you do something about this?

345
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:38,493
You can't lock people up
in their own neighborhood!

346
00:24:38,664 --> 00:24:40,632
- Step behind the barricade.
- Fuck them!

347
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,769
- Take these barricades out!
- I'm not talking till you step back.

348
00:24:43,936 --> 00:24:45,801
You're not talking to me?
Fine, I'll talk.

349
00:24:45,972 --> 00:24:47,803
- Do you see him?
- Hey, look...

350
00:24:47,974 --> 00:24:51,808
Just go and get him, take him upstairs
before he gets in trouble, all right?

351
00:24:54,347 --> 00:24:56,474
- You know where she lives?
- Yeah, why?

352
00:24:56,649 --> 00:24:58,446
Meet me over there, huh?

353
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:02,654
You step off!
No, this is my neighborhood!

354
00:25:02,955 --> 00:25:05,116
These are my projects.
I'm not going nowhere.

355
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:07,191
No, I'm not going nowhere.

356
00:25:23,276 --> 00:25:24,834
- Billy, come on!
- No!

357
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:27,479
- You think you is, man?
- Come on.

358
00:25:34,687 --> 00:25:36,245
Go home!

359
00:25:37,423 --> 00:25:40,256
<i>Attention, Armstrong residents,</i>

360
00:25:40,426 --> 00:25:42,018

...<i>while police conduct</i>

362
00:25:44,764 --> 00:25:46,288
Detective, is that Cody's mom?

363
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:50,258
- Do you think it was deliberate?
- Get the hell out of here.

364
00:25:50,436 --> 00:25:53,701
Come on, Detective Council.
Look over here.

365
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:02,512
<i>This is a lockdown</i>.
<i>Please remain behind the barriers</i>.

366
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:21,121
- I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
- We gotta go.

367
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:10,113
- No, please.
- All right, all right.

368
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:51,381
You know, I was thinking.

369
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:54,589
Once I said,
"Cody, do you love me?"

370
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,228
And you know what he said?
He's 4, right.

371
00:27:57,396 --> 00:27:59,227
He said, "Of course I love you,
Mommy.

372
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:01,662
Why would you even ask me that?"

373
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:05,133
All right, I'll see if they'll post a
Gannon detective downstairs for you.

374
00:28:05,304 --> 00:28:07,067
The sketch artist is on his way over.

375
00:28:07,473 --> 00:28:10,442
He's gonna do the jacker.
I'll get Felicia to come stay with you.

376
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:12,042
Okay.

377
00:28:13,012 --> 00:28:14,604
Get some sleep.

378
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,645
Okay.

379
00:28:22,988 --> 00:28:24,478
Felicia.

380
00:28:33,365 --> 00:28:35,299
You see him?

381
00:28:35,468 --> 00:28:37,333
- You see him?
- Yeah.

382
00:28:37,503 --> 00:28:40,233
Look, I promise I'll deal with it.

383
00:28:40,406 --> 00:28:44,137
That sketch artist is on his way over.
As soon as he's done...

384
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,642
...make sure her head
is on a pillow. Okay?

385
00:28:49,115 --> 00:28:50,639
Lorenzo.

386
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,545
I don't know anybody
in those houses...

387
00:28:52,718 --> 00:28:54,447
...who would have laid a
hand on Brenda.

388
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,316
She was known.
She was respected.

389
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:59,188
All right.

390
00:29:00,192 --> 00:29:03,025
- Thanks for this.
- Sure.

391
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:12,836
Say, partner, you good to drive?

392
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:16,206
- What?
- You good to drive?

393
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,808
Well, hell, yeah.

394
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,077
Tell you what,
why don't you take a power nap?

395
00:29:23,382 --> 00:29:26,545
- I'll bring these back in an hour.
- Man, what the hell are you doing?

396
00:30:12,164 --> 00:30:14,291
If you're trying to get
my attention, you got it.

397
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:16,259
How you doing, Detective Council?

398
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:18,631
- You're a reporter?
- Me? No.

399
00:30:18,804 --> 00:30:20,704
Karen Collucci. Friends of Kent.

400
00:30:20,873 --> 00:30:22,636
Friends of K..?

401
00:30:24,677 --> 00:30:28,909
Oh, you those people go around
looking for missing children and such.

402
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:31,049
We find them.

403
00:30:31,817 --> 00:30:34,308
Remember Corey Baker
over in Bayonne?

404
00:30:34,486 --> 00:30:38,479
- And Nedra Davis in Jersey City?
- Yeah. They were killed.

405
00:30:39,425 --> 00:30:40,983
I know. We found them.

406
00:30:42,294 --> 00:30:45,127
Anyways, if you think it would help,
and if the mother agrees...

407
00:30:45,297 --> 00:30:48,061
...we'd like to help you
find Cody Martin.

408
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:51,769
- No, I don't think so.
- Okay. No problem.

409
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:55,498
How about you take one of our cards
in case you change your mind?

410
00:31:02,481 --> 00:31:05,917
You know, I'd bet everything
I have that...

411
00:31:06,085 --> 00:31:07,575
...Tania Leeds...

412
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:10,017
...been dead from the jump.

413
00:31:10,556 --> 00:31:14,151
Probably. But whoever did her
is still out there, right?

414
00:31:16,528 --> 00:31:20,988
Anyways, it's the anniversary, so we're
hoping somebody'd step up, but...

415
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:26,033
You look half dead, Lorenzo.
Hope you can get some sleep.

416
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:01,162
Check it out.

417
00:32:02,675 --> 00:32:05,166
Who the hell is that, now?
Buddha or some-fucking-body?

418
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:08,480
What? It's Tupac, man.

419
00:32:08,881 --> 00:32:10,439
It's Pac.

420
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,445
Jas, man, come on.

421
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:15,814
This is your body,
not some billboard.

422
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:18,450
Well, I was about
to get Tiger Woods...

423
00:32:18,624 --> 00:32:22,390
...but I figured that wouldn't go over
too well with the brothers in here.

424
00:32:22,928 --> 00:32:25,396
I'm sorry, man. Time's up.

425
00:32:26,565 --> 00:32:28,089
Finish up over here, folks.

426
00:32:35,507 --> 00:32:37,372
Watch your back, all right?

427
00:32:37,543 --> 00:32:39,204
You too, Pops.

428
00:32:56,462 --> 00:32:59,556
This is ridiculous!
They have to go to school!

429
00:33:00,432 --> 00:33:02,024
- You don't understand.
- Come on!

430
00:33:02,201 --> 00:33:03,793
We're trying.

431
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:06,197
- The search for the missing child,
Cody Martin.

432
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,078
I'm tired of this.

433
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:21,446
Just give me a break, okay?
You gotta move back.

434
00:33:25,057 --> 00:33:26,649
Tell me, how's this supposed
to help?

435
00:33:26,825 --> 00:33:29,123
You're doing nothing but
harassing innocent people.

436
00:33:29,294 --> 00:33:31,159
Three years ago,
Belmont Houses...

437
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:34,663
...maintenance man gets shot, 700
windows overlooking the scene.

438
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:37,028
We shut it down, what,
a day, day and a half...

439
00:33:37,202 --> 00:33:39,864
...they brought us the actor
on a platter. That was my call.

440
00:33:40,038 --> 00:33:42,404
Yeah, but what if nobody
around here knows nothing?

441
00:33:42,574 --> 00:33:44,439
If this was anywhere
other than Armstrong...

442
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:48,011
If this was anywhere than Armstrong
Housing, I would have yanked you.

443
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,741
- Now, the mother. Is she a scumbag?
- No, I don't think so.

444
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:53,782
So if she's the actor,
will she hang tough?

445
00:33:53,952 --> 00:33:56,250
- No, I don't.
- It's time to take a hard run at her.

446
00:33:56,422 --> 00:33:57,684
You think?

447
00:33:57,856 --> 00:33:59,847
Back it up, back it up.

448
00:34:00,025 --> 00:34:02,118
He has no statement.

449
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:04,786
You know, Bobby,
if this woman is faking it...

450
00:34:04,963 --> 00:34:06,954
...she's in the wrong line of work.

451
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:08,963
There is one thing that
keeps bugging me.

452
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:11,694
All right, so I go by the hospital
last night, right?

453
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:16,204
She says she got beat on by
a black man, 5'8", 150 pounds.

454
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:18,639
Now here comes me.
Black as a coal miner's ass...

455
00:34:18,811 --> 00:34:21,541
...at midnight and twice that size.
I roll right up on her.

456
00:34:21,713 --> 00:34:24,045
You know what she does?
She shakes my hand.

457
00:34:24,216 --> 00:34:26,946
She should've taken a look at me
and jumped out of her skin.

458
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,485
But, no, she shakes
my motherfucking hand.

459
00:34:29,655 --> 00:34:32,920
Lorenzo. You wanna do yourself
a big favor?

460
00:34:33,091 --> 00:34:35,218
- Give her to me.
- You?

461
00:34:35,394 --> 00:34:37,259
Yeah. Look, if she
don't give it up soon...

462
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:40,660
...with this going on, all these people,
they're gonna come down on you.

463
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:42,466
It's wrong.

464
00:34:42,634 --> 00:34:46,229
<i>- Call the Dempsy Police</i>
<i>at 201</i><i>- 153...</i>

465
00:34:46,405 --> 00:34:48,532
- All right.
- Hey. Big Daddy!

466
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:53,833
- You gonna do anything about this?
- Yeah, what you gonna do, man?

467
00:34:55,347 --> 00:34:58,908
I'm here at the Armstrong Houses on
the border of Gannon and Dempsy.

468
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:02,076
Tempers are beginning to flare.
This is day two of the search...

469
00:35:02,254 --> 00:35:04,654
...for 4-year-old Gannon resident
Cody Martin.

470
00:35:04,823 --> 00:35:08,122
Police suspect his abductor
is here in the Armstrong Houses.

471
00:35:08,293 --> 00:35:10,454
We will continue our coverage
through the day...

472
00:35:10,629 --> 00:35:12,426
...bringing you news as it breaks.

473
00:35:12,598 --> 00:35:16,329
<i>This is Victor Diaz reporting</i>
<i>to you from Channel 9</i>.

474
00:35:16,502 --> 00:35:18,060
- Danny.
- Brenda, listen to me.

475
00:35:18,237 --> 00:35:20,205
- Leave me alone.
- Brenda, please.

476
00:35:20,372 --> 00:35:22,567
- Why's it always gotta be like this?
- Stop, no.

477
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:24,470
Every time I see you, I put out a fire.

478
00:35:24,643 --> 00:35:26,372
- Tell me what happened.
- Leave me alone.

479
00:35:26,545 --> 00:35:28,843
Brenda, please.
Tell me what happened.

480
00:35:29,014 --> 00:35:32,882
- I said, 50 times.
- Yeah, I know. Say it again.

481
00:35:33,952 --> 00:35:37,979
Brenda. Please,
we are chasing ghosts out there.

482
00:35:38,156 --> 00:35:41,751
Where's the kid? Where's the car?
We can't even find...

483
00:35:43,428 --> 00:35:44,861
- Are you getting high again?
- No!

484
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,964
- You can tell me. I won't get angry.
- No!

485
00:35:47,132 --> 00:35:49,896
"No, I'm not doing dope,"
or, "No, I won't tell you"?

486
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:51,626
No, leave me alone!

487
00:35:51,803 --> 00:35:54,636
What the hell is wrong with you?
Can't you even raise a child?

488
00:35:58,777 --> 00:36:00,438
Brenda, I'm sorry, but, please...

489
00:36:02,014 --> 00:36:04,949
Brenda. I'm sorry, but...
Brenda, I'm your brother.

490
00:36:05,117 --> 00:36:08,109
I love you. Just tell me
what happened.

491
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,917
Jesus Christ!

492
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,728
He came in here.
I didn't know what to do.

493
00:36:16,895 --> 00:36:18,362
Did you find him?

494
00:36:19,598 --> 00:36:21,395
No. No, not yet.

495
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,431
I'm gonna take you back
to Armstrong.

496
00:36:29,608 --> 00:36:32,702
You can see the scene
during the daytime, okay?

497
00:36:34,046 --> 00:36:37,243
- How's that look to you?
- Did they arrest anyone?

498
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:39,077
No, not yet.

499
00:37:01,907 --> 00:37:04,171
Wait! Ms. Martin!

500
00:37:04,343 --> 00:37:06,140
Have they found Cody?

501
00:37:13,352 --> 00:37:15,343
Ms. Martin, please!

502
00:37:33,205 --> 00:37:36,641
Yo, what's the deal, Zo?
What's the deal, huh?

503
00:37:36,808 --> 00:37:39,003
- That your girl, Zo?
- Let her loose, man.

504
00:37:39,177 --> 00:37:41,270
Let her loose, Zo.

505
00:37:43,815 --> 00:37:45,783
Put your heavy away.
We ain't doing nothing.

506
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:47,384
Just keep on walking.

507
00:37:50,522 --> 00:37:52,353
This place is locked down
and you know it.

508
00:37:52,524 --> 00:37:54,185
We didn't do nothing!

509
00:38:10,509 --> 00:38:13,342
- How's it look to you from up here?
- What are they doing?

510
00:38:13,512 --> 00:38:15,377
Brenda. Show me.

511
00:38:15,547 --> 00:38:17,913
Point out where you
tried to cut through the park.

512
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:20,210
Exactly where that guy
came on to you.

513
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:22,819
How can I tell? It was night.

514
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,719
Okay, Brenda,
I gotta ask you something.

515
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:34,524
If I don't, I wouldn't be doing my job.

516
00:38:35,701 --> 00:38:38,898
Two-thirds of the kids missing,
the person that called it in...

517
00:38:39,071 --> 00:38:41,471
...is usually the person
that made the kid go missing.

518
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,871
- So I gotta ask.
- What, did I kill my son?

519
00:38:47,746 --> 00:38:51,375
I have... Since I've been little,
I have been nothing.

520
00:38:51,783 --> 00:38:55,344
Less than nothing.
In... In my family, in... In the world...

521
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,489
...the only time anybody noticed me
was when I fucked something up.

522
00:38:58,657 --> 00:39:02,184
Dropped out of college, lost a job,
lost an apartment, did drugs.

523
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,794
When I had to move back
into my childhood bedroom...

524
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:06,897
...because I didn't have
a penny to my name.

525
00:39:07,065 --> 00:39:12,059
And when they did notice me, my
so-called people, my family?

526
00:39:12,237 --> 00:39:14,728
The eyes, the smirks.

527
00:39:16,374 --> 00:39:18,842
But you know when all that stopped?

528
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,706
For them? For me?

529
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,814
When I had my son.

530
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:25,973
When I had Cody.

531
00:39:26,151 --> 00:39:30,315
As soon... As soon as I had him
in my arms, I became, like, more.

532
00:39:30,489 --> 00:39:33,720
I became like...
Like, "Fuck you, fuck all of you!

533
00:39:33,892 --> 00:39:38,295
You cannot touch this! You cannot be
this... This... This baby's mother, me!

534
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:40,021
I am that!"

535
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,499
So did I kill him?

536
00:39:43,969 --> 00:39:46,028
He gave birth to me.

537
00:39:46,438 --> 00:39:47,962
He made me.

538
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,040
I would slaughter myself
10 times over...

539
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:52,802
...before I would touch
a hair on his head.

540
00:39:55,814 --> 00:39:57,611
Nothing you can
tell me that would help?

541
00:39:57,783 --> 00:39:59,808
Can't you stop it?

542
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:03,415
I would if I could, Brenda...

543
00:40:06,691 --> 00:40:09,159
...but it's got a life of its own now.

544
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:21,204
I tell you, 22 years of policing
in this city...

545
00:40:21,373 --> 00:40:24,809
...things I see day in, day out...

546
00:40:25,544 --> 00:40:29,674
...makes it very, very hard
to have faith in humanity.

547
00:40:31,383 --> 00:40:34,352
But I do believe in God.

548
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:38,922
I believe that whatever happens to us,
the good things, the bad things...

549
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:42,419
...they all happen
because God wills it.

550
00:40:43,762 --> 00:40:45,696
Like this thing with your son.

551
00:40:46,064 --> 00:40:48,055
You know, looking for your son.

552
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,860
Now I know somewhere in the back
of your mind is the great, great fear...

553
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:57,770
...that things are gonna
turn out unhappy.

554
00:40:57,943 --> 00:41:00,173
Well, me too, Brenda.

555
00:41:00,345 --> 00:41:02,210
Me too.

556
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:04,782
But you got to take strength.

557
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:09,284
You gotta believe that if something,
you know, happened...

558
00:41:09,454 --> 00:41:11,547
...if that's the case...

559
00:41:11,723 --> 00:41:14,954
...it's because God
wanted that little boy...

560
00:41:15,126 --> 00:41:17,287
...like he's gonna want
all of us one day.

561
00:41:17,462 --> 00:41:21,626
And it ain't nobody's fault.
Wasn't nothing nobody could do.

562
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:24,431
But know this, Brenda.

563
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:29,670
I will not rest until I find your son.

564
00:41:29,841 --> 00:41:31,934
And the person that...

565
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:36,138
The person that he was last with.

566
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:45,248
You know, the more we try to know,
the more mysterious life gets.

567
00:41:45,423 --> 00:41:50,952
Sometimes there's nothing else
to do but just let go.

568
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,264
You just gotta let go...

569
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,868
...and let God.

570
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,183
Come here.

571
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:28,098
Look at that.

572
00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:34,670
This place is ticking
like a time bomb.

573
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,573
Now, you know what that means
because you ain't no tourist.

574
00:42:38,743 --> 00:42:41,678
In fact, from what I hear, you get
much love around here, right?

575
00:42:41,846 --> 00:42:43,279
- I'm so tired.
- Brenda, Brenda.

576
00:42:43,448 --> 00:42:45,040
Brenda, Brenda. Brenda...

577
00:42:45,216 --> 00:42:49,152
...I want to find your son.
That's first.

578
00:42:49,321 --> 00:42:52,347
But I wanna find him
before anybody gets hurt.

579
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:55,654
Now, we're banging our heads
against the wall on this thing.

580
00:42:55,827 --> 00:42:58,921
We're doing all we can,
so if there's anything you can say...

581
00:42:59,097 --> 00:43:03,124
...that would stop this,
now is the time.

582
00:43:03,301 --> 00:43:05,326
Brenda, please.

583
00:43:06,037 --> 00:43:09,268
Now, come on. Please.

584
00:43:13,878 --> 00:43:15,709
I'm trying.

585
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,111
I'm trying. It's just so hard.

586
00:43:19,851 --> 00:43:22,285
You have no idea.

587
00:43:39,904 --> 00:43:42,202
Can I just see the kids?

588
00:43:47,345 --> 00:43:50,746
- There she is.
- Ms. Martin!

589
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:54,211
Oh, my goodness.

590
00:43:54,386 --> 00:43:59,085
- Hi. Hi, Brandon.
- Did they find Cody yet?

591
00:43:59,257 --> 00:44:01,782
No, baby, they didn't.

592
00:44:02,127 --> 00:44:04,186
I'm okay. I'm okay.

593
00:44:04,362 --> 00:44:06,956
Hey, what are you making?
Show me.

594
00:44:07,132 --> 00:44:09,032
Show me, let me see.

595
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,533
Oh, my goodness.
Here, can I share your seat?

596
00:44:12,704 --> 00:44:15,229
- Oh, look at that.
- So where's Felicia?

597
00:44:15,407 --> 00:44:17,068
Dealing with Billy.

598
00:44:17,242 --> 00:44:18,766
Oh, that's beautiful.

599
00:44:18,943 --> 00:44:20,604
Did Brenda come
to work yesterday?

600
00:44:20,779 --> 00:44:22,747
- Yeah.
- How'd she seem to you?

601
00:44:22,914 --> 00:44:25,906
- She seemed kind of out of it. But...
- She bring Cody with her?

602
00:44:26,918 --> 00:44:29,478
No. She said he was sick.

603
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:32,647
- Do you wanna see my son?
- What?

604
00:44:32,824 --> 00:44:34,257
Here.

605
00:44:34,893 --> 00:44:38,192
You know, I think it was good for him
to be the only white kid here.

606
00:44:38,363 --> 00:44:42,663
You know, it's important to know
what it feels like to be the only one.

607
00:44:43,401 --> 00:44:46,393
You think it's okay
I borrow Cody's picture?

608
00:44:46,571 --> 00:44:49,165
- Take mine!
- You can have ours, go ahead.

609
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:53,401
Oh, I love these pictures.
Thank you so much.

610
00:44:53,578 --> 00:44:55,136
- Ms. Martin?
- Yes, sweetheart?

611
00:44:55,313 --> 00:44:57,042
What happened to your hands?

612
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:00,241
I just got some cuts in them,
but see these bandages?

613
00:45:00,418 --> 00:45:02,852
It's gonna make it all better.
I'm gonna be just fine.

614
00:45:03,021 --> 00:45:06,320
Thank you, sweetheart.
Oh, Cassandra.

Drama.

630
00:46:14,959 --> 00:46:17,985
- Come on, man, you deaf?
- What?

631
00:46:19,731 --> 00:46:21,198
Candygram.

632
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,128
- Hey. Rafik!
- Get him!

633
00:46:25,303 --> 00:46:27,294
Get the fuck off me!

634
00:46:27,872 --> 00:46:29,464
Get the fuck off!

635
00:46:29,641 --> 00:46:31,370
Get off me!

636
00:46:31,543 --> 00:46:33,875
You son of a bitch!

637
00:46:34,546 --> 00:46:37,845
If you can't afford me the respect,
if you can't treat me like a man...

638
00:46:38,016 --> 00:46:40,644
...if you insist on emasculating me...
- Emasculating?

639
00:46:40,818 --> 00:46:42,649
- Yeah!
- You emasculate yourself!

640
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,118
- Is that what I do?
- You mope around my apartment.

641
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:48,350
- Ain't looking for work.
- That's what the fuck I'm talking about.

642
00:46:48,526 --> 00:46:50,721
You ain't a man.
You ain't supporting your family.

643
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:53,830
- I beg your pardon.
- Nobody is allowed out, all right?

644
00:46:53,998 --> 00:46:55,693
- For what?
- He can go on out.

645
00:46:55,867 --> 00:46:59,428
- But I don't know these kids.
- You don't need to know these kids.

646
00:46:59,604 --> 00:47:01,071
- Let them through.
- But we...

647
00:47:01,239 --> 00:47:03,139
- Whose side are you on?
- You know who I am.

648
00:47:03,308 --> 00:47:05,208
You know what I'm about.
Nothing's changed.

649
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:07,037
What goddamn carjacker, huh?

650
00:47:07,212 --> 00:47:10,909
Put some heat under your girlfriend,
you might find out what's going on.

651
00:47:11,082 --> 00:47:14,279
- Do not tell me how to do my job.
- And do not tell me how to do mine.

652
00:47:14,452 --> 00:47:16,477
- I know how to do mine.
- Let them through.

653
00:47:16,654 --> 00:47:19,452
No. Not yet. Forget it.
Not yet. Come on.

654
00:47:19,624 --> 00:47:21,251
- What the fuck you want?
- Salim!

655
00:47:21,426 --> 00:47:23,690
- What the fuck is up now?
- No! No!

656
00:47:23,861 --> 00:47:25,226
- Fuck.
- No!

657
00:47:27,098 --> 00:47:29,123
Man, this is bullshit!

658
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,165
Fuck this bitch, man.

659
00:47:35,006 --> 00:47:36,940
Make a hole, make a hole,
make a hole!

660
00:47:37,308 --> 00:47:39,674
Hey, hey, hey.

661
00:47:39,844 --> 00:47:42,005
- Get off me, man.
- Get in there!

662
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,240
You know you're wrong.
You're wrong. You're wrong.

663
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:47,281
- Yo, what's going on?
- What y'all doing?

664
00:47:47,452 --> 00:47:50,216
Y'all better bring him back.
You better bring him back.

665
00:47:50,722 --> 00:47:52,519
- Bobby!
- Who are you talking to?

666
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:55,124
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Felicia!

667
00:47:56,361 --> 00:47:57,953
Felicia!

668
00:47:58,129 --> 00:48:00,495
- Felicia!
- Felicia. Felicia, don't...

669
00:48:00,865 --> 00:48:03,265
- Everyone's getting unruly.
- Felicia.

670
00:48:06,104 --> 00:48:08,038
Do me a favor. Watch her.

671
00:48:08,206 --> 00:48:11,141
Take her to your apartment.
I'll be back for her.

672
00:48:24,622 --> 00:48:27,455
- Back up!
- Damn! Come on, y'all!

673
00:48:34,499 --> 00:48:37,957
Hey, Lorraine, I just saw Cassandra.
She... She made me a drawing.

674
00:48:39,137 --> 00:48:41,401
- What are you doing with her?
- Excuse me?

675
00:48:41,572 --> 00:48:44,473
- What is she doing here?
- You don't know her?

676
00:48:44,776 --> 00:48:47,973
I don't know nobody from Gannon.

677
00:48:51,983 --> 00:48:53,780
And you stay away from my child.

678
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:56,249
What? What?

679
00:48:56,421 --> 00:48:59,549
Fair-weather bitch.
Come on, Brenda.

680
00:49:13,771 --> 00:49:16,001
Come on, Rafik.
Why don't you just cop to it?

681
00:49:16,174 --> 00:49:17,971
- Leo.
- You can do better than that.

682
00:49:18,142 --> 00:49:20,406
- We wanna know the truth.
- Something's going on.

683
00:49:20,578 --> 00:49:22,205
- He bolted on us.
- Let's go!

684
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,780
- We're serious here, Rafik.
- Yo, yo, yo. Hey.

685
00:49:24,949 --> 00:49:26,541
Hey, fellas.

686
00:49:26,851 --> 00:49:29,786
- You got to go through me.
- Yeah, well, we got tired of waiting.

687
00:49:29,954 --> 00:49:31,387
- Waiting for what?
- For you.

688
00:49:31,556 --> 00:49:33,183
You said you'd pick him up for us.

689
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:35,383
You brought him
in on that bullshit car stop?

690
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,050
In this town, drugs is drugs.

691
00:49:37,228 --> 00:49:40,391
- Lorenzo, they setting me up.
- Setting you up for what, brother?

692
00:49:44,135 --> 00:49:47,696
Lorenzo, you know, me and Rafik,
we go way back, right?

693
00:49:47,872 --> 00:49:51,330
I come up on my man with this, as
you just said, two-bit warrant today?

694
00:49:51,509 --> 00:49:54,034
And all of a sudden he
goes all-out rabbit on me.

695
00:49:54,212 --> 00:49:57,704
I don't get it. Unless there's
something you're worried about.

696
00:49:57,882 --> 00:50:00,282
- Is there?
- Hey.

697
00:50:01,586 --> 00:50:02,814
Hey.

698
00:50:07,725 --> 00:50:09,283
This is you?

699
00:50:11,195 --> 00:50:14,096
- This is you? Where's my nephew?
- Hey! Get him out!

700
00:50:14,265 --> 00:50:17,234
- Get off!
- Get him out!

701
00:50:17,402 --> 00:50:19,393
- Come on, come on.
- Come here!

702
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:21,094
Pull him off!

703
00:50:22,807 --> 00:50:24,798
- Get him out of here!
- Where's my nephew, huh?

704
00:50:24,976 --> 00:50:26,910
- Come on, get him off.
- Where is he?

705
00:50:27,078 --> 00:50:28,807
- Come on!
- You mother...

706
00:50:29,647 --> 00:50:31,137
- Oh, my God, stop!
- Danny!

707
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:34,543
- Stop!
- Come here!

708
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:37,017
- Danny!
- Come on, man, what are you doing?

709
00:50:37,188 --> 00:50:38,951
- Hey, chill out.
- Hey, Rafik!

710
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:42,149
- Take it easy, man.
- Get the fuck off me!

711
00:50:42,326 --> 00:50:43,884
- You know God?
- Keep on going.

712
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:46,791
Fuck God! There is no God!
I'm God!

713
00:50:46,964 --> 00:50:50,661
It's just you and me, motherfucker!
You hear me? It's just you and me!

714
00:50:51,702 --> 00:50:53,602
What the fuck are you doing?

715
00:50:53,771 --> 00:50:55,534
- What, me?
- Lorenzo, take a hike.

716
00:50:55,706 --> 00:50:58,937
I'm doing your job. You're supposed
to be king of the jungle over there?

717
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:01,039
How'd you miss this monkey?

718
00:51:01,212 --> 00:51:04,306
- I think you better leave, brother.
- Kiss my ass, brotherfucker!

719
00:51:04,816 --> 00:51:08,547
You are balling things up for
everybody, your sister included.

720
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:13,418
And if your peoples here had any
sense, they'd tell you the same thing.

721
00:51:14,525 --> 00:51:16,356
Hey, Lorenzo.

722
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:19,087
What are you doing here, huh?
Protecting your own?

723
00:51:19,263 --> 00:51:21,993
I don't know. But maybe I ought
to ask you the same question.

724
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:25,624
Because you know and I know
there ain't no fucking jacker.

725
00:51:26,804 --> 00:51:30,103
- You calling my sister a child-killer?
- I know nothing about a dead child.

726
00:51:30,274 --> 00:51:32,674
You know something about
a dead child?

727
00:51:33,978 --> 00:51:36,538
I'm just saying your sister's a liar.

728
00:51:37,548 --> 00:51:40,244
What's going on in there? Lorenzo!

729
00:51:40,418 --> 00:51:43,353
- Lorenzo, open up this door!
- Lorenzo!

730
00:51:44,355 --> 00:51:46,414
Come on, Lorenzo, open the door!

731
00:51:46,591 --> 00:51:49,924
- You better talk to me.
- Open the door right now, Lorenzo.

732
00:51:50,094 --> 00:51:52,619
- What is this?
- What the hell y'all doing to Rafik?

733
00:51:52,797 --> 00:51:54,890
What is going on?
He didn't do nothing!

734
00:51:55,066 --> 00:51:57,694
- Who let them in?
- Yo, you beat him for weed?

735
00:51:57,869 --> 00:52:00,565
- Hey, get out of my face!
- Or what, you gonna beat on us too?

736
00:52:00,738 --> 00:52:04,105
- Shut your hole and get out of here!
- Who are you to talk to us like that...

737
00:52:04,275 --> 00:52:06,266
...you three-piece
Uncle Tom motherfucker?

738
00:52:06,444 --> 00:52:08,071
Come on, look.
Just let me handle it.

739
00:52:08,246 --> 00:52:11,044
Buzz us in. Buzz the...
Buzz us back in!

740
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:12,705
- He didn't take that kid.
- I know.

741
00:52:12,884 --> 00:52:15,717
Why'd they do that to him?
He didn't take that bitch's kid.

742
00:52:15,887 --> 00:52:17,878
- I know.
- What'd they do that for?

743
00:52:18,489 --> 00:52:20,616
- Just go home.
- What'd they do that for?

744
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:22,759
I said, go home.
Let me handle it, okay?

745
00:52:22,927 --> 00:52:24,189
Lorenzo.

746
00:52:24,462 --> 00:52:26,862
I don't know who
you think you are...

747
00:52:27,031 --> 00:52:29,591
...but I think you best
be sticking with them.

748
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:14,176
- Well, it's over.
- What?

749
00:53:14,345 --> 00:53:17,314
The DA wants us to hand it over
to the feds.

750
00:53:17,915 --> 00:53:20,782
Look, it's a good thing, Big Daddy.
Gets you off the hook.

751
00:53:20,952 --> 00:53:23,716
No. No, no. No.

752
00:53:23,888 --> 00:53:27,187
Come on. The kid's dead.
She did it. I mean, fuck her.

753
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:30,794
Hey, slow your roll there, Bobby. We
don't know either one of those things.

754
00:53:30,962 --> 00:53:32,293
What I do know is...

755
00:53:32,463 --> 00:53:35,864
...there's a whole hell of a lot
about that night that she ain't telling.

756
00:53:36,033 --> 00:53:38,695
I'm not quitting
till I get to the bottom of it.

757
00:53:41,906 --> 00:53:46,104
Do me a favor, Bobby.
Go back, buy me one more day.

758
00:53:54,218 --> 00:53:57,085
We organize search parties.
We work with the families.

759
00:53:57,254 --> 00:53:58,915
We work with the cops.

760
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:01,854
But most of all, we're just
a bunch of parents, you know?

761
00:54:02,026 --> 00:54:05,052
Concerned parents. Because of
that, because of who we are...

762
00:54:05,229 --> 00:54:09,063
...we get in tight with the moms in
a way that's different from the police.

763
00:54:09,233 --> 00:54:11,428
- You know what I'm saying.
- You were in on that...

764
00:54:11,602 --> 00:54:13,900
...Sandra Howard thing
in Bayonne, right?

765
00:54:14,071 --> 00:54:16,198
- Am I remembering that right?
- Yeah, we helped.

766
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:19,104
The mother got locked up
on that one.

767
00:54:19,276 --> 00:54:20,800
Like I said, we helped.

768
00:54:24,081 --> 00:54:26,675
Well, I don't want you jumping
to conclusions about Brenda.

769
00:54:26,851 --> 00:54:28,910
No. No, that wouldn't
serve anybody.

770
00:54:29,086 --> 00:54:30,678
And I call the shots.

771
00:54:30,855 --> 00:54:33,153
Yes. It goes without saying
that we'd cooperate...

772
00:54:33,324 --> 00:54:36,725
No, no, no. I call the shots.

773
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:41,191
Now, I got something
in my head...

774
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:44,823
...that would play out better coming
from somebody other than me.

775
00:54:45,002 --> 00:54:47,197
I'll let your people
do whatever it is they do...

776
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:52,172
...but with all due respect, you'll be
working for me and not with me.

777
00:54:52,877 --> 00:54:54,674
If that's unacceptable,
all you do is...

778
00:54:54,845 --> 00:54:58,804
You tell us where you wanna go,
and we will help you get there.

779
00:55:00,718 --> 00:55:03,186
Yeah, all right. Okay, then.

780
00:55:03,454 --> 00:55:04,944
<i>We just want the boy back</i>.

781
00:55:06,023 --> 00:55:09,720
Have you or any of your people
ever been out to Freedomland?

782
00:55:10,761 --> 00:55:13,594
You guys still hazing
your rookies there?

783
00:55:14,532 --> 00:55:15,965
Yeah.

784
00:55:21,238 --> 00:55:24,730
Detective Council here brought us up
to speed from the police point of view.

785
00:55:24,909 --> 00:55:27,571
But we are not here as cops.
We're here as parents.

786
00:55:27,745 --> 00:55:29,906
We're here because
we all have children too.

787
00:55:30,081 --> 00:55:31,378
What happened to your son...

788
00:55:31,549 --> 00:55:34,143
...could have happened
to any of our own children, okay?

789
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:36,149
Okay.

790
00:55:36,454 --> 00:55:38,979
Now, this is Marie. And Lewis.

791
00:55:39,523 --> 00:55:42,390
This is Elaine. This is Tina.

792
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,118
Elaine is her mom.

793
00:55:44,295 --> 00:55:45,887
Who's Kent?

794
00:55:46,063 --> 00:55:49,692
He's the first boy we ever
tried to find. Ten years ago.

795
00:55:49,867 --> 00:55:51,960
We've been helping find kids
ever since.

796
00:55:52,136 --> 00:55:54,798
- Did you find Kent?
- Brenda?

797
00:55:54,972 --> 00:55:57,236
Would you like our help?

798
00:55:59,276 --> 00:56:00,538
Okay.

799
00:56:00,711 --> 00:56:02,941
Good. Good.

800
00:56:03,981 --> 00:56:07,974
Okay, now, first off, what I need
is to hear from you what happened.

801
00:56:08,152 --> 00:56:10,848
I can't. I can't say that.
I told the police everything.

802
00:56:11,021 --> 00:56:13,080
- I told them...
- I know, I know, I know, I know.

803
00:56:13,257 --> 00:56:16,852
It's just... Look, like I said, they
have their priorities and we have ours.

804
00:56:17,027 --> 00:56:19,723
One more time, Brenda, and
I wouldn't put you through this...

805
00:56:19,897 --> 00:56:22,957
No. No. I can't. I just...

806
00:56:25,536 --> 00:56:26,935
No.

807
00:56:30,007 --> 00:56:31,599
Okay.

808
00:56:34,111 --> 00:56:36,409
Okay. I understand.

809
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:39,174
We'll just go with the police report
if you want.

810
00:56:40,151 --> 00:56:43,882
Okay. Now first thing,
we come to the question head-on.

811
00:56:45,956 --> 00:56:47,924
Where is your son?

812
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:52,689
Right? Where do we look?

813
00:56:52,863 --> 00:56:55,559
Where do we look?
What is your gut feeling, Brenda?

814
00:56:55,733 --> 00:56:58,361
- He took off in a car.
- Okay, well, let's say your son...

815
00:56:58,536 --> 00:57:01,835
...woke up. Let's say the guy
realized he had a kid in the car...

816
00:57:02,006 --> 00:57:05,032
...sooner rather than later.
So let's keep it within a mile.

817
00:57:05,209 --> 00:57:08,076
But the fact of the matter is,
it's been almost 24 hours.

818
00:57:08,245 --> 00:57:10,372
So the odds of him still
wandering the streets...

819
00:57:10,548 --> 00:57:13,278
...not getting picked up by now
are not so good.

820
00:57:13,751 --> 00:57:16,379
Now, we looked at the map
earlier today, and we came up...

821
00:57:16,554 --> 00:57:19,648
...with four possibilities where a kid
could conceivably get lost...

822
00:57:19,824 --> 00:57:22,884
...or hide out for a whole day
or night and not get noticed.

823
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:25,585
And then we drove around,
we eliminated three of them.

824
00:57:25,763 --> 00:57:29,460
This is a golf course.
This is a cemetery.

825
00:57:29,633 --> 00:57:31,328
This is a ball field.

826
00:57:31,502 --> 00:57:34,437
There's no cover, no place
to hide, if that's what he's doing.

827
00:57:34,605 --> 00:57:37,233
Which leaves us...

828
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:39,168
...Freedomland.

829
00:57:39,743 --> 00:57:41,540
Freedomland?

830
00:57:41,712 --> 00:57:44,613
It's an old state children's home
in the back of Cotter's Woods.

831
00:57:44,782 --> 00:57:47,717
It was like a foundling asylum,
like some kind of a youth house.

832
00:57:47,885 --> 00:57:50,581
- It's been shut since the '50s.
- It's not far from Armstrong.

833
00:57:50,754 --> 00:57:54,246
- Cody could have...
- Yeah, okay. Okay.

834
00:57:58,829 --> 00:58:00,558
So Freedomland?

835
00:58:00,731 --> 00:58:02,926
I feel good about Freedomland
for this one.

836
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,034
- Okay.
- Okay.

837
00:58:05,202 --> 00:58:06,931
Freedomland it is.

838
00:58:07,104 --> 00:58:10,164
- You're coming too, right?
- Absolutely.

839
00:58:57,388 --> 00:58:58,855
What the hell's all this?

840
00:58:59,023 --> 00:59:01,457
- I just need to get her to Freedomland.
- And you will.

841
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:04,219
It's not gonna work if you
make a beeline for it. Trust me.

842
00:59:04,395 --> 00:59:06,693
Meanwhile, we have a little problem.

843
00:59:08,699 --> 00:59:11,668
Look, you're here,
you might as well get out.

844
00:59:11,835 --> 00:59:13,826
Just let us open the door.
How about that?

845
00:59:14,004 --> 00:59:15,699
Excuse me, ladies.

846
00:59:20,444 --> 00:59:22,571
Hey, Brenda. How you doing?

847
00:59:41,632 --> 00:59:46,467
Heavenly father, we ask for your
blessing and guiding hand today...

848
00:59:47,538 --> 00:59:49,972
...as we send these volunteers down...

849
00:59:50,474 --> 00:59:54,342
...to help the mother of Cody Martin
find her child...

850
00:59:54,511 --> 00:59:56,706
...and safely bring him home.

851
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,371
And we ask for the courage
and fortitude...

852
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:03,145
...to see this task successfully done.

853
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,982
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son...

854
01:00:06,156 --> 01:00:08,750
...and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

855
01:00:08,926 --> 01:00:10,689
Amen.

856
01:01:38,015 --> 01:01:39,539
Cody!

857
01:01:39,716 --> 01:01:43,049
- Cody!
- Cody!

858
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:45,154
- Cody!
- Cody!

859
01:01:45,322 --> 01:01:48,587
- Cody!
- Cody!

860
01:01:49,226 --> 01:01:51,786
- Cody!
- Cody!

861
01:01:51,962 --> 01:01:54,624
So where's her bug bands?

862
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:56,322
Karen doesn't wear bug bands.

863
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,901
Jesus. Anything bit Karen,
it'd lose its mind.

864
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:01,731
Really? Why?

865
01:02:01,905 --> 01:02:04,874
Because Karen's son was abducted.

866
01:02:05,275 --> 01:02:07,106
Our first kid.

867
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:09,202
You mean, Kent?

868
01:02:09,746 --> 01:02:11,680
Ten years ago.

869
01:02:13,851 --> 01:02:15,876
Tina here was a baby.

870
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,318
We all knew each other
from the neighborhood.

871
01:02:19,490 --> 01:02:21,515
- Karen got us together.
- Cody Martin!

872
01:02:21,692 --> 01:02:24,490
We had no idea what the hell
we were doing...

873
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:28,620
...but we wound up combing
every goddamn forest...

874
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:34,499
...field, drainpipe, creek, culvert...
Oh, everywhere.

875
01:02:35,539 --> 01:02:39,475
And you know, we...
We still post flyers.

876
01:02:40,677 --> 01:02:43,271
Well, what can I say? We...

877
01:02:43,447 --> 01:02:46,245
We got better at it with practice.

878
01:02:47,351 --> 01:02:50,548
Karen knows who took him too.
The cops just can't prove it.

879
01:02:50,721 --> 01:02:52,313
- We can't prove it.
- Yeah.

880
01:02:52,489 --> 01:02:53,922
God.

881
01:02:54,091 --> 01:02:56,685
Me and Kent went to school together.
So like...

882
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:59,055
...I know he's my own age and all.

883
01:02:59,229 --> 01:03:02,027
When we find him, I'm still
expecting him to be 8 years old...

884
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:03,666
...like the last time I saw him.

885
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:06,259
Cody!

886
01:03:08,138 --> 01:03:10,003
- Cody!
- Come on, Cody!

887
01:03:12,142 --> 01:03:13,871
So why you all triple-teaming me...

888
01:03:14,044 --> 01:03:16,569
...while Karen's got Brenda
by herself all up in her ear?

889
01:03:16,747 --> 01:03:17,975
Why?

890
01:03:18,148 --> 01:03:20,639
- Sympathy.
- Sympathy.

891
01:03:20,817 --> 01:03:24,583
I never lost a child, Lorenzo.
Did you?

892
01:03:36,767 --> 01:03:39,065
- Cody!
- Cody Martin!

893
01:03:40,404 --> 01:03:42,599
Hey, Cody!

894
01:03:43,273 --> 01:03:45,207
Cody Martin!

895
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:48,935
- Cody Martin!
- Cody!

896
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:22,267
Watch that.

897
01:05:26,677 --> 01:05:28,838
Stay together.

898
01:05:39,556 --> 01:05:41,581
Watch your step. I've got you.

899
01:05:43,226 --> 01:05:44,750
- All right.
- Keep moving.

900
01:05:44,928 --> 01:05:46,725
I'm so tired.

901
01:05:46,897 --> 01:05:48,728
What do you want from me?

902
01:06:11,955 --> 01:06:14,082
We're gonna have a look around.

903
01:06:14,257 --> 01:06:17,556
It's a little dangerous. Half of these
floorboards can go at any minute.

904
01:06:17,728 --> 01:06:20,925
So I want you to stay in here
and wait for us, okay?

905
01:06:21,498 --> 01:06:22,988
What are you doing?

906
01:06:23,166 --> 01:06:25,134
Just wait for us.

907
01:06:32,242 --> 01:06:34,472
I can't be alone.

908
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:52,992
I swear to God,
I feel like they're still here.

909
01:06:56,032 --> 01:06:57,659
I tell you, when...

910
01:06:57,834 --> 01:07:00,302
When they finally padlocked
this place, it was...

911
01:07:00,904 --> 01:07:03,668
It was like shutting down hell.

912
01:07:05,409 --> 01:07:10,142
Do you have any idea
of the generations of children...

913
01:07:10,313 --> 01:07:12,577
...who suffered in here?

914
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:15,013
Thousands.

915
01:07:16,219 --> 01:07:20,053
Thousands who were neglected...

916
01:07:21,158 --> 01:07:23,490
...and abused...

917
01:07:23,927 --> 01:07:25,952
...forgotten.

918
01:07:27,063 --> 01:07:29,088
Just...

919
01:07:29,266 --> 01:07:31,496
Just wasted.

920
01:08:28,825 --> 01:08:31,385
<i>Even your own family turns on you</i>
<i>after a while</i>.

921
01:08:31,561 --> 01:08:33,552
You come downstairs,
the other kids are like:

922
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:36,460
"Mommy, are you gonna
be sad today?"

923
01:08:37,567 --> 01:08:40,035
That's the only thing that can
bring you back to some...

924
01:08:40,203 --> 01:08:42,296
...charade of normal life,
when it hits you...

925
01:08:42,472 --> 01:08:46,408
...what you're doing to your
other kids, to your marriage.

926
01:08:47,077 --> 01:08:50,911
But with me, I couldn't even
rally for that. I couldn't fake it.

927
01:08:51,748 --> 01:08:55,548
This bastard, Jimmy,
he took away my life.

928
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:58,017
He took away my family.

929
01:09:00,023 --> 01:09:02,184
My husband's like, you know,
"Come on, Karen...

930
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:05,294
...you gotta think about
the other kids. Think about me.

931
01:09:05,462 --> 01:09:08,454
We gotta get on with
the business of living."

932
01:09:09,432 --> 01:09:12,265
That's what he called it,
"the business of living."

933
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:18,975
See, men, they always cave in.

934
01:09:19,643 --> 01:09:21,508
Talk to you about
the business of living...

935
01:09:21,678 --> 01:09:23,646
...tell you to,
"Think about the others.

936
01:09:23,813 --> 01:09:26,008
The rest of us." Them.

937
01:09:28,885 --> 01:09:30,682
And then they leave.

938
01:09:30,854 --> 01:09:33,220
Because they just don't
have the belly for it.

939
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:35,551
They just don't have the heart.

940
01:09:37,627 --> 01:09:39,288
We...

941
01:09:41,097 --> 01:09:43,793
We are the hunters, Brenda.

942
01:09:47,904 --> 01:09:51,101
What can I say to my other kids?
They're with my husband now.

943
01:09:51,841 --> 01:09:53,308
All I can tell them is the truth:

944
01:09:53,476 --> 01:09:55,876
If it had happened to them
instead of their brother...

945
01:09:56,046 --> 01:09:58,037
...I would be the same way for them.

946
01:09:59,616 --> 01:10:01,880
I want them back, my family.

947
01:10:02,052 --> 01:10:05,920
But until someone can tell me
that my son is gone...

948
01:10:06,957 --> 01:10:08,652
...here I am.

949
01:10:09,426 --> 01:10:11,621
And here I'll stay.

950
01:10:16,232 --> 01:10:19,429
Sometimes I just wanna grab...

951
01:10:20,337 --> 01:10:23,636
...that murderous, perverted
son of a bitch and say to him:

952
01:10:23,807 --> 01:10:27,140
"Look, Jimmy, you took him.
I know it and you know it.

953
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:29,210
Now, don't say a word,
just nod your head.

954
01:10:29,379 --> 01:10:32,007
Is he dead? Yes or no?

955
01:10:32,182 --> 01:10:34,446
Do that for me,
I will never bother you again.

956
01:10:34,618 --> 01:10:36,609
No one's gonna nail you
for nodding your head.

957
01:10:36,786 --> 01:10:39,721
I swear I will go away.
You will never see me again.

958
01:10:39,889 --> 01:10:41,550
Is he dead?

959
01:10:41,725 --> 01:10:43,693
Just nod your head.

960
01:10:46,196 --> 01:10:48,824
I need to know.
I need to know now, Jimmy.

961
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:50,728
Is he dead?

962
01:10:52,235 --> 01:10:55,329
Sweet Christ in heaven...

963
01:10:55,505 --> 01:10:57,769
...won't you please just tell me?

964
01:10:57,941 --> 01:11:00,068
Just nod your head."

965
01:11:04,614 --> 01:11:07,447
A nod of the head,
such a little thing.

966
01:11:07,751 --> 01:11:10,618
And night becomes day.

967
01:11:12,022 --> 01:11:15,389
Is he dead? Yes or no?
That's all I ask.

968
01:11:15,558 --> 01:11:17,321
Yes or no?

969
01:11:19,629 --> 01:11:21,722
Put my heart at rest.

970
01:11:22,365 --> 01:11:25,425
Put my heart at rest, Brenda.

971
01:11:32,542 --> 01:11:35,170
It's so hot.

972
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:39,744
I feel like I'm in hell.

973
01:11:50,293 --> 01:11:51,885
When I said I just wanted to know...

974
01:11:52,062 --> 01:11:54,656
...if my son was dead or alive,
that's not completely true.

975
01:11:54,831 --> 01:11:58,289
I would like to give him
a proper burial in sanctified ground.

976
01:11:58,468 --> 01:12:00,265
The thought of him
lying in some ditch...

977
01:12:00,437 --> 01:12:04,897
...in some shallow grave in the forest
where the animals can...

978
01:12:17,954 --> 01:12:20,149
Shit.

979
01:12:32,001 --> 01:12:34,595
My boy wasn't like
those children in there.

980
01:12:35,371 --> 01:12:38,067
- Okay.
- He was loved.

981
01:12:41,611 --> 01:12:43,374
He was cherished.

982
01:12:43,546 --> 01:12:44,808
Okay.

983
01:12:44,981 --> 01:12:46,846
He's not here.

984
01:12:50,286 --> 01:12:52,117
You're in the wrong park.

985
01:12:54,424 --> 01:12:56,085
Thank you, God.

986
01:13:01,731 --> 01:13:02,959
Thank you.

987
01:13:20,784 --> 01:13:22,775
Is he dead?

988
01:13:25,622 --> 01:13:27,214
- What?
- Yes.

989
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:29,950
- How?
- He drank a bottle of cough syrup.

990
01:13:30,126 --> 01:13:31,991
- When was this?
- Two nights ago.

991
01:13:32,162 --> 01:13:34,824
- The night you came to the hospital?
- The night before that.

992
01:13:37,934 --> 01:13:40,835
- Did you see him drink the syrup?
- No, I wasn't there.

993
01:13:41,604 --> 01:13:43,538
Was anybody else..?

994
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:46,865
He was all alone.

995
01:13:50,413 --> 01:13:52,643
He was... He was all...

996
01:13:53,683 --> 01:13:55,310
All alone.

997
01:13:58,922 --> 01:14:00,583
Where is he, Brenda?

998
01:14:01,891 --> 01:14:03,882
He's not here.

999
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:05,925
Brenda.

1000
01:14:06,362 --> 01:14:08,262
Where is he?

1001
01:14:12,702 --> 01:14:15,136
Oh, God, please.

1002
01:14:22,745 --> 01:14:23,905
Oh, God. Please.

1003
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,538
- God, I can't find him.
- Just try to stay calm.

1004
01:14:28,685 --> 01:14:31,085
I can't find him.

1005
01:14:42,999 --> 01:14:44,762
I can't find him.

1006
01:14:52,342 --> 01:14:54,139
Come here.

1007
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:55,572
I think we've got something.

1008
01:14:55,945 --> 01:14:58,106
<i>Copy that. We're on our way</i>.

1009
01:14:58,281 --> 01:15:01,148
This is subsoil.
It should be about two feet under.

1010
01:15:01,317 --> 01:15:04,218
And this formation here,
this is man-made.

1011
01:15:04,387 --> 01:15:07,083
- Is this it? Is this where he is?
- Yes.

1012
01:15:07,257 --> 01:15:09,452
- This is where you buried him?
- Yes.

1013
01:15:11,794 --> 01:15:13,762
- You dug this up?
- Yes.

1014
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:16,626
- You dug this up?
- Yes.

1015
01:15:19,168 --> 01:15:20,795
- And then what'd you do?
- What?

1016
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:23,438
- You pile all these rocks on here?
- Yes.

1017
01:15:23,606 --> 01:15:25,471
- All these stones.
- Yes.

1018
01:15:25,975 --> 01:15:27,738
Over here.

1019
01:15:28,711 --> 01:15:30,201
What are they doing?

1020
01:15:32,181 --> 01:15:34,741
- I can't be here. I...
- Hey. Hey. I don't wanna be here...

1021
01:15:34,918 --> 01:15:36,886
...any more than you.
- I'll tell you.

1022
01:15:37,053 --> 01:15:39,521
I don't want a lawyer.
Just please, just take me away.

1023
01:15:39,822 --> 01:15:41,221
Everything.

1024
01:15:41,524 --> 01:15:43,719
Yeah, I swear, but...

1025
01:15:44,594 --> 01:15:45,788
...just to you.

1026
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:51,599
All right, come here.

1027
01:15:53,469 --> 01:15:56,165
We're gonna go, but I need you
to do one thing for me, okay?

1028
01:15:56,339 --> 01:15:59,103
- What?
- Show me how you carried the stones.

1029
01:15:59,909 --> 01:16:02,275
I need you to pick me up...

1030
01:16:02,445 --> 01:16:03,810
...that one right there.

1031
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:30,437
Here. Just take it from me.

1032
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:34,068
Come on. Take it.

1033
01:16:34,978 --> 01:16:36,707
Take it.

1034
01:16:42,552 --> 01:16:46,215
You know, Brenda,
when you tell me everything...

1035
01:16:47,423 --> 01:16:51,382
...I want you to start by telling me
who dug that grave.

1036
01:16:51,561 --> 01:16:53,461
And who carried those stones.

1037
01:16:53,629 --> 01:16:58,191
And please, please,
do not tell me it was you.

1038
01:16:58,368 --> 01:17:00,734
Because if you start with a lie...

1039
01:17:00,903 --> 01:17:04,066
...you will have lost the greatest ally
you've ever had in your life...

1040
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,936
...and I won't even bother
to take your statement.

1041
01:17:07,777 --> 01:17:10,337
I will charge you and dump your ass
in the system.

1042
01:17:10,513 --> 01:17:12,378
You hear what I'm saying?
You hear me?

1043
01:17:12,882 --> 01:17:15,350
Please, just... I swear to God,
I'll tell you everything.

1044
01:17:15,518 --> 01:17:17,076
Just take me away, please.

1045
01:17:21,691 --> 01:17:24,285
- Page me when he's up.
- Right.

1046
01:17:25,028 --> 01:17:27,496
- Go.
<i>- Y'all know who this is?</i>

1047
01:17:28,631 --> 01:17:30,292
This is me.

1048
01:17:30,466 --> 01:17:33,094
This is you, and you, and you.

1049
01:17:33,269 --> 01:17:36,466
This is all of us and none of us.

1050
01:17:36,806 --> 01:17:39,570
This is the nigger in the woodpile.

1051
01:17:40,309 --> 01:17:44,803
This is, "A black man did it."
The hottest item in the store.

1052
01:17:44,981 --> 01:17:46,278
- But you know what?
- What?

1053
01:17:46,449 --> 01:17:47,677
We ain't buying it.

1054
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:49,283
- You know what?
- What?

1055
01:17:49,452 --> 01:17:50,919
<i>We ain't having it</i>.

1056
01:17:51,554 --> 01:17:52,885
<i>Gannon, heads up</i>.

1057
01:17:53,056 --> 01:17:54,956
<i>Hey, Dempsy, heads up</i>.

1058
01:17:55,124 --> 01:17:59,117
<i>Here's the point that you been missing</i>
<i>Armstrong ain't no locked-down prison</i>

1059
01:17:59,328 --> 01:18:01,956
<i>Hey, Gannon, heads up</i>
<i>Hey, Dempsy, heads up</i>

1060
01:18:02,131 --> 01:18:03,598
<i>Here's the point that you...</i>

1061
01:18:03,766 --> 01:18:05,131
Hey.

1062
01:18:05,535 --> 01:18:08,732
- You charge her yet?
- I'm waiting on the body.

1063
01:18:08,905 --> 01:18:10,133
She kill him?

1064
01:18:10,306 --> 01:18:12,399
- I don't know.
- You gotta go with homicide.

1065
01:18:12,575 --> 01:18:14,099
- Okay.
- Otherwise, Armstrong...

1066
01:18:14,277 --> 01:18:16,370
- They'll raise the fucking roof tonight.
- Hey.

1067
01:18:16,546 --> 01:18:18,343
I tried to get you
to stop the blockade.

1068
01:18:18,514 --> 01:18:20,277
- Circumstances dictated...
- Circumstances?

1069
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:22,042
You wanna talk circumstances?

1070
01:18:22,718 --> 01:18:24,845
The circumstances were,
it was Armstrong.

1071
01:18:25,021 --> 01:18:28,422
The circumstances were, they were a
bunch of mud-flat animals on welfare...

1072
01:18:28,591 --> 01:18:31,458
...that didn't deserve the consideration
or respect you give a dog.

1073
01:18:31,627 --> 01:18:35,222
Look, Lorenzo, the prosecutor...

1074
01:18:35,398 --> 01:18:38,299
...if he has a press conference
tonight to announce the arrest...

1075
01:18:38,468 --> 01:18:39,696
...he wants you by his side.

1076
01:18:39,869 --> 01:18:42,667
- Talk to people about keeping cool.
- Oh, he does, does he?

1077
01:18:42,839 --> 01:18:45,865
Well, you tell that prosecutor
he can kiss my black ass.

1078
01:18:46,309 --> 01:18:48,800
And when he's done,
you can get some too.

1079
01:18:59,222 --> 01:19:01,452
- Where is she?
- Interview room.

1080
01:19:01,624 --> 01:19:03,558
Does she at least have
a fucking lawyer?

1081
01:19:03,726 --> 01:19:05,557
Danny, wait. You can't...

1082
01:19:09,732 --> 01:19:12,963
So, Brenda,
let's talk about those stones.

1083
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:17,803
He didn't wanna have anything
to do with it, but he did it for me.

1084
01:19:17,974 --> 01:19:21,842
- Who? Who did?
- I dug that grave with my hands.

1085
01:19:22,178 --> 01:19:24,271
I did. I told myself...

1086
01:19:24,447 --> 01:19:27,848
...I was making his bed one last time,
and that's how I got through it.

1087
01:19:28,017 --> 01:19:30,417
There was no way I could
bring my boy to that place...

1088
01:19:30,586 --> 01:19:32,349
...so I begged him to do it for me.

1089
01:19:32,522 --> 01:19:35,218
He had to do it, Billy.
I had no one else to turn to.

1090
01:19:35,391 --> 01:19:37,052
Billy? Billy who?

1091
01:19:37,226 --> 01:19:40,320
I told him he was responsible
for what had happened too...

1092
01:19:40,496 --> 01:19:43,124
...but it was all me. It was always me.

1093
01:19:43,299 --> 01:19:46,564
But he had to do it.
I had no one else to turn to.

1094
01:19:46,736 --> 01:19:48,795
Billy who?

1095
01:19:49,071 --> 01:19:50,595
Felicia's Billy.

1096
01:20:02,618 --> 01:20:06,315
I have spent all my life trying to
get distance from other people.

1097
01:20:06,489 --> 01:20:10,425
- My family, men, other kids...
- Hey, hey, hey, Brenda. Brenda.

1098
01:20:10,893 --> 01:20:13,418
Let's stick to what happened
three nights ago, all right?

1099
01:20:13,596 --> 01:20:16,724
No, no, you have to let me.
Ever since I met you...

1100
01:20:16,899 --> 01:20:19,993
...Ive been trying to think of a way
to really, really tell you this.

1101
01:20:20,169 --> 01:20:22,034
And now you just have to let me.

1102
01:20:25,374 --> 01:20:29,333
With my family, my brothers, it was
like, "Everybody just leave me be."

1103
01:20:29,512 --> 01:20:32,447
But with a child, when you
have a child, it's yours, it's safe.

1104
01:20:32,615 --> 01:20:34,845
It's finally safe. And...

1105
01:20:35,017 --> 01:20:36,951
And when I got pregnant,
it was an accident.

1106
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:39,679
I mean, it never occurred to me
to have a baby.

1107
01:20:39,855 --> 01:20:42,983
I was my own baby.
But then I had this vision...

1108
01:20:43,159 --> 01:20:44,888
...of what it could be like.

1109
01:20:45,328 --> 01:20:49,059
The companionship,
the secret...

1110
01:20:49,232 --> 01:20:50,961
...companionship.

1111
01:20:51,133 --> 01:20:52,896
I never told the guy
who knocked me up.

1112
01:20:53,069 --> 01:20:56,038
And for four years with Cody,
it's like life is this cliff...

1113
01:20:56,205 --> 01:20:58,730
...but we carved out a ledge
together, you know? But...

1114
01:21:00,343 --> 01:21:02,641
But it wasn't enough,
just being with my son.

1115
01:21:02,812 --> 01:21:05,576
You can't...
You can't live like that.

1116
01:21:06,349 --> 01:21:08,476
Did Billy have anything to do
with what happened?

1117
01:21:08,651 --> 01:21:10,619
No, he barely even met Cody.

1118
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:13,615
So Billy...

1119
01:21:13,789 --> 01:21:16,883
I had this thing that I did
at the Rainbow Club. I...

1120
01:21:17,059 --> 01:21:19,755
I brought in professionals,
teachers, lawyers, cops...

1121
01:21:19,929 --> 01:21:22,363
...to talk to the kids,
to show them another way to be.

1122
01:21:22,531 --> 01:21:25,523
So Billy comes in. I knew he was
unemployed and it was so sad...

1123
01:21:25,701 --> 01:21:28,727
...but he talked to the kids
so earnestly...

1124
01:21:28,904 --> 01:21:31,737
...about stocks and bonds
and investments...

1125
01:21:31,907 --> 01:21:34,341
...and it was way over their head,
but it was so...

1126
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:38,207
So sweet, you know. And I looked over
at Felicia while he was talking...

1127
01:21:38,381 --> 01:21:41,043
...and she rolls her eyes
like she's had it with this loser.

1128
01:21:41,217 --> 01:21:45,950
But I understood him so well,
so fast, because it's like... Like...

1129
01:21:46,122 --> 01:21:47,350
...he was me.

1130
01:21:48,624 --> 01:21:51,184
And so after the talk,
I went over and I took his hand...

1131
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,727
...and, yeah, he must have jumped
a mile, but it was on, you know.

1132
01:21:54,897 --> 01:21:58,298
The whole thing took, like,
10 seconds and it was on.

1133
01:22:00,703 --> 01:22:03,331
After he came over
to my apartment that night...

1134
01:22:03,506 --> 01:22:05,406
...I knew I was in trouble...

1135
01:22:05,574 --> 01:22:08,668
...because I had finally lain down
with someone who was not a child...

1136
01:22:08,844 --> 01:22:10,471
...after all these years. I had...

1137
01:22:11,213 --> 01:22:14,979
...over-abstained, you see,
and I was in deep trouble.

1138
01:22:22,425 --> 01:22:26,384
Before Billy, I used to love
to lie down with Cody...

1139
01:22:26,562 --> 01:22:29,497
...or just watch movies with him
before he went to bed.

1140
01:22:29,665 --> 01:22:32,566
And now, it's like
I look at my son's face...

1141
01:22:32,735 --> 01:22:35,761
...in the TV light,
and it's like he's...

1142
01:22:35,938 --> 01:22:38,600
He's un-precious to me.
And it's, like, videos, you know?

1143
01:22:38,774 --> 01:22:41,766
I'm wasting critical minutes.
You know, Billy's downstairs.

1144
01:22:41,944 --> 01:22:44,435
I gotta get this kid down.
And you know, Cody takes...

1145
01:22:48,784 --> 01:22:50,274
Cody...

1146
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,215
Cody took...

1147
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:57,286
...an hour,
sometimes 30 minutes.

1148
01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:03,430
And I... I know he can feel my tension,
and it's keeping him awake.

1149
01:23:03,599 --> 01:23:05,328
Sometimes I would think
he was asleep...

1150
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:08,402
...and I'd be halfway down the hall,
like tippy-toe, tippy-toe...

1151
01:23:08,571 --> 01:23:11,540
...and I'd hear, "Mommy. Mommy."
And I'd be like:

1152
01:23:11,707 --> 01:23:14,175
"Get to sleep!"
And how fast would you fall asleep...

1153
01:23:14,343 --> 01:23:16,868
...if you have this half-insane giant
hanging over you...

1154
01:23:17,046 --> 01:23:19,037
...who doesn't love you
or want you anymore?

1155
01:23:19,215 --> 01:23:21,683
Who used to treat you like
the sun, moon and stars...

1156
01:23:21,851 --> 01:23:24,547
...but no more, no more.

1157
01:23:30,626 --> 01:23:32,890
So I started giving him...

1158
01:23:33,062 --> 01:23:34,654
...cough syrup...

1159
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:36,855
...to put him to sleep.
You know, not much.

1160
01:23:37,032 --> 01:23:40,331
Just whatever you give a kid
for a stuffed head.

1161
01:23:40,503 --> 01:23:42,095
And it worked.

1162
01:23:42,505 --> 01:23:45,906
It worked. And I told him it was
night vitamins.

1163
01:23:46,075 --> 01:23:48,509
And it became part
of our bedtime routine.

1164
01:23:48,677 --> 01:23:50,645
Look, Brenda,
I hear what you're saying...

1165
01:23:50,813 --> 01:23:53,441
...but we gotta get back to what
happened three nights ago.

1166
01:23:53,616 --> 01:23:57,074
- I need you to start telling me...
- He wouldn't go down, Cody.

1167
01:23:57,253 --> 01:24:00,017
You know, I had already dosed him
and he wouldn't go down.

1168
01:24:00,189 --> 01:24:03,215
And that night, you know,
I had to talk to Billy because...

1169
01:24:03,392 --> 01:24:07,453
...I knew that he was breaking it off
and going back to Felicia.

1170
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:09,928
And the thing of it is,
I was kind of relieved...

1171
01:24:10,099 --> 01:24:13,398
...that Billy was dumping me
and putting me out of my misery...

1172
01:24:13,569 --> 01:24:16,265
...and it was probably the last night
I'd leave my son alone.

1173
01:24:16,439 --> 01:24:17,929
It was probably...

1174
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:20,706
Probably the last,
but he wouldn't go down.

1175
01:24:21,143 --> 01:24:23,668
So I said to him:

1176
01:24:23,846 --> 01:24:26,474
"You be a good boy
and go to sleep."

1177
01:24:26,649 --> 01:24:28,310
And he was...
You know, he was furious.

1178
01:24:28,484 --> 01:24:31,715
He said, "I don't want you to go."
But like a man would say it, you know:

1179
01:24:31,887 --> 01:24:34,151
- "I don't want you to go."
- "I don't want you to go."

1180
01:24:34,323 --> 01:24:36,917
You know, standing there all punchy
with the cough syrup...

1181
01:24:37,092 --> 01:24:40,220
...and, you know, I wanna say to him,
"Tonight is the last night.

1182
01:24:40,396 --> 01:24:43,024
Just give me this one last..."

1183
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:46,168
But I said, you know:

1184
01:24:46,836 --> 01:24:50,294
"You go to sleep.
I'll be back soon. I promise."

1185
01:24:50,473 --> 01:24:52,532
And he says, you know...

1186
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:56,007
He says to me,
"If you go, you'll be sorry."

1187
01:24:56,178 --> 01:25:02,242
But like a jealous husband, you know.
"If you go, you'll be sorry."

1188
01:25:02,818 --> 01:25:05,480
And I almost, you know...
I almost didn't go.

1189
01:25:05,654 --> 01:25:08,088
You know, I'd never...
I never heard that tone from him.

1190
01:25:08,257 --> 01:25:11,090
If he'd only sounded like,
you know, more...

1191
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:13,694
More babyish or more pathetic.

1192
01:25:13,863 --> 01:25:15,990
But, you know, it was so hard,
his voice...

1193
01:25:16,165 --> 01:25:18,998
...and it scared me. It, like,
drove me out of the house...

1194
01:25:19,168 --> 01:25:22,763
...and, you know, he was...
He was only 4 years old.

1195
01:25:22,938 --> 01:25:25,964
You know,
nobody has to tell me that.

1196
01:25:32,047 --> 01:25:34,106
So...

1197
01:25:36,085 --> 01:25:38,110
...I go downstairs...

1198
01:25:38,287 --> 01:25:40,050
...and sure enough...

1199
01:25:40,389 --> 01:25:44,189
...Billy says it's over.
And I'm yelling and I'm crying...

1200
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:47,386
...but really I'm just going
through the motions because...

1201
01:25:47,563 --> 01:25:51,260
Because really, I'm kind of relieved.
And I go back upstairs and I...

1202
01:25:51,433 --> 01:25:55,028
I don't see him, Cody,
and I look for him in his bed.

1203
01:25:55,204 --> 01:25:56,796
And I'm... I...

1204
01:25:56,972 --> 01:26:00,373
I'm like, you know, "Oh, he's hiding,"
you know, "He's...

1205
01:26:00,543 --> 01:26:02,568
He's hiding. He's mad at me.

1206
01:26:02,745 --> 01:26:05,009
He's trying to scare me
or punish me or something.

1207
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:07,114
But that's okay,
because I deserve it."

1208
01:26:07,283 --> 01:26:10,411
And I'm kind of lighthearted now,
you know...

1209
01:26:10,586 --> 01:26:13,316
...because it's all over and done with,
so I'm like, "Cody?

1210
01:26:13,489 --> 01:26:16,151
Cody?" Like, "Where are you?"

1211
01:26:16,325 --> 01:26:20,591
And then I see him, you know,
he's under the table. And he's asleep.

1212
01:26:20,763 --> 01:26:26,497
And I... And I crawl over there because
I'm gonna carry him back to bed.

1213
01:26:26,669 --> 01:26:30,332
And I put my hand
in something wet...

1214
01:26:30,506 --> 01:26:33,669
...and there's the smell...

1215
01:26:35,611 --> 01:26:37,374
The smell...

1216
01:26:38,414 --> 01:26:42,316
And that's when I saw
the empty bottle.

1217
01:26:44,353 --> 01:26:48,483
And I remembered,
"If you go, you'll be sorry.

1218
01:26:48,657 --> 01:26:52,753
If you go, you'll be sorry."

1219
01:26:55,064 --> 01:26:56,429
Well, was he still alive?

1220
01:26:58,067 --> 01:27:00,661
- How do you know?
- He was not alive.

1221
01:27:01,170 --> 01:27:04,606
- Did you try to revive him?
- He was not alive.

1222
01:27:04,773 --> 01:27:06,434
Tell me how you knew
he was not alive.

1223
01:27:06,609 --> 01:27:08,543
Because I'm his mom.

1224
01:27:08,711 --> 01:27:12,203
And us moms know these things.

1225
01:27:14,049 --> 01:27:18,509
He said, "If you go, you'll be sorry."
And he was right.

1226
01:27:18,687 --> 01:27:19,949
- He was right.
- Brenda.

1227
01:27:20,122 --> 01:27:22,556
- He didn't know what he was doing.
- He was right.

1228
01:27:22,725 --> 01:27:24,317
- He was right.
- Brenda, listen to me.

1229
01:27:24,493 --> 01:27:27,951
It was an accident. If what you
described is true, it was an accident.

1230
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:30,325
- Don't you play me.
- What happened next?

1231
01:27:30,499 --> 01:27:32,091
No.

1232
01:27:32,267 --> 01:27:35,634
- Brenda, we gotta keep talking.
- No, I'm done. Just charge me.

1233
01:27:44,947 --> 01:27:47,142
Tell me, Brenda,
you wanna see Billy go to jail?

1234
01:27:47,316 --> 01:27:49,079
- For what?
- Well, if we stop now...

1235
01:27:49,251 --> 01:27:51,913
...I charge him with obstruction,
conspiracy.

1236
01:27:52,087 --> 01:27:55,523
If all he did was carry a body,
you need to take me to the end.

1237
01:28:02,398 --> 01:28:05,834
All I remember is putting my hand
in something wet.

1238
01:28:06,001 --> 01:28:09,596
I remember the smell
and then I was walking.

1239
01:28:09,772 --> 01:28:12,673
I was walking and thinking about...

1240
01:28:12,841 --> 01:28:15,537
...my son, thinking about...

1241
01:28:15,711 --> 01:28:17,838
...living without no...

1242
01:28:18,013 --> 01:28:20,743
Living every day with...

1243
01:28:20,916 --> 01:28:23,817
And I'm like,
"Just walk out into the road.

1244
01:28:23,986 --> 01:28:26,887
Just die." But...

1245
01:28:27,823 --> 01:28:30,053
...I couldn't do it.

1246
01:28:32,027 --> 01:28:36,088
And I'm in this fog, you know.
This fog. And I'm walking...

1247
01:28:36,265 --> 01:28:41,999
...and I wind up in that park, and
I'm clawing and I'm making his...

1248
01:28:42,171 --> 01:28:46,471
Then I had... I needed to go back
and to get him, and how could I?

1249
01:28:46,642 --> 01:28:49,270
And so I called Billy.

1250
01:28:49,445 --> 01:28:51,470
And what did he do, exactly?

1251
01:28:51,647 --> 01:28:53,410
I was not there, but...

1252
01:28:53,849 --> 01:28:57,341
...<i>he must have gone back up</i>
<i>to my apartment and seen Cody...</i>

1253
01:28:57,519 --> 01:28:59,077
...<i>and put him in my car</i>.

1254
01:28:59,254 --> 01:29:02,417
<i>And I guess I must have told him</i>
<i>where to go because...</i>

1255
01:29:02,591 --> 01:29:04,456
<i>And the stones...</i>

1256
01:29:05,394 --> 01:29:08,625
I guess he did that
to make it proper.

1257
01:29:08,797 --> 01:29:11,288
And then the next night...

1258
01:29:12,301 --> 01:29:14,735
...I... I must have known
what I was gonna do...

1259
01:29:14,903 --> 01:29:16,734
...but I don't remember
thinking about it.

1260
01:29:16,905 --> 01:29:19,373
I went to Martyrs Park
and I threw my bag in the dirt...

1261
01:29:19,541 --> 01:29:21,873
...and I just started
jamming my hands in the...

1262
01:29:22,044 --> 01:29:25,411
In the shit, just shoving them in.
I just wanted to get every fucking...

1263
01:29:25,581 --> 01:29:28,982
...broken, like, rusted... Like,
you know, all of it, like, in my skin.

1264
01:29:29,151 --> 01:29:31,779
And then I walked through
Armstrong, and I'm...

1265
01:29:31,954 --> 01:29:33,979
I guess I knew I was going
to the hospital...

1266
01:29:34,156 --> 01:29:38,286
...and I guess I knew what I was
gonna say, but I don't remember...

1267
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:42,920
...knowing the story, you know, the lie,
before it came out of my mouth.

1268
01:29:43,098 --> 01:29:45,828
And I think of it now, I guess
I knew somewhere in my head...

1269
01:29:46,001 --> 01:29:49,164
...that Armstrong could take it.
And that nobody...

1270
01:29:49,338 --> 01:29:52,899
...no individual would really
be hurt by it...

1271
01:29:53,075 --> 01:29:55,839
...and that I could go on,
you know...

1272
01:29:56,645 --> 01:29:58,840
...with some kind of life, but...

1273
01:30:00,349 --> 01:30:02,146
...no, you can't.

1274
01:30:02,851 --> 01:30:04,182
You can't.

1275
01:30:04,853 --> 01:30:06,548
No.

1276
01:30:07,055 --> 01:30:08,283
- What?
- What?

1277
01:30:08,457 --> 01:30:10,982
What is it? They have Cody?

1278
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:13,685
- Is he okay?
- What?

1279
01:30:15,464 --> 01:30:17,329
What..? What did I do?

1280
01:30:17,733 --> 01:30:18,995
Okay, Brenda.

1281
01:30:19,168 --> 01:30:22,729
At this point, I'm gonna have
to charge you with homicide.

1282
01:30:23,005 --> 01:30:26,202
Now, personally,
I have no reason to disbelieve...

1283
01:30:26,375 --> 01:30:28,138
...anything that you've said to me.

1284
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:30,642
I wouldn't have always been able
to be there for him.

1285
01:30:30,813 --> 01:30:33,407
Well, because of all the
obstruction you put in our path...

1286
01:30:33,582 --> 01:30:35,709
...this is what's required of me.
You understand?

1287
01:30:35,884 --> 01:30:39,877
Now, once the forensics are in, the
charge will probably be downgraded.

1288
01:30:42,491 --> 01:30:45,085
This is Dempsy Detective
Lorenzo Council.

1289
01:30:45,494 --> 01:30:49,225
I'm in the interrogation room of
the Southern District Precinct House.

1290
01:30:49,398 --> 01:30:52,697
It is May 4th, 4:55 p.m.

1291
01:30:52,868 --> 01:30:56,031
I'm with Brenda Martin,
a 37-year-old white female...

1292
01:30:56,205 --> 01:30:59,971
...who resides at 16 Van Loon Street,
Gannon, New Jersey.

1293
01:31:00,142 --> 01:31:03,043
Phone number, 120-7210.

1294
01:31:03,212 --> 01:31:07,512
Social Security number,
983-40-3947.

1295
01:31:07,683 --> 01:31:09,776
- What have I done?
- Statement is in relation...

1296
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,886
...to the death
of 4-year-old Cody Martin.

1297
01:31:14,723 --> 01:31:18,215
Brenda! Hey! Hey!
Stop it. Stop it.

1298
01:31:18,393 --> 01:31:21,362
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop!

1299
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:24,260
Can I get some help?
Somebody help me!

1300
01:31:24,433 --> 01:31:26,526
Can I get some help in here?

1301
01:31:27,436 --> 01:31:28,960
Calm down! Calm...

1302
01:31:29,571 --> 01:31:31,402
Calm down. Calm down.

1303
01:31:31,940 --> 01:31:34,738
Just take it easy, guys. Take it easy.
Don't hurt her.

1304
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:41,912
- Okay. It's okay.
- Easy, easy.

1305
01:32:13,248 --> 01:32:15,307
Detective Council.

1306
01:32:15,951 --> 01:32:18,920
How bad was what I did?

1307
01:32:19,087 --> 01:32:21,214
I mean, look in your heart.

1308
01:32:21,523 --> 01:32:23,286
How bad was what I did?

1309
01:32:23,592 --> 01:32:26,686
Come on, Billy. Let's go. Come on.

1310
01:32:29,498 --> 01:32:30,931
Look, I don't care what you say.

1311
01:32:31,099 --> 01:32:32,327
- Don't touch me, man!
- No.

1312
01:32:32,501 --> 01:32:35,129
There's nothing you can do.
There's nothing you can do.

1313
01:32:35,304 --> 01:32:38,171
Oh, my goodness. Nothing I can do.
What do you want from me?

1314
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:39,637
For heaven's sake.

1315

<i>All units, Code Three</i>.

01:33:20,048 --> 01:33:21,379
Help!

1327
01:33:38,033 --> 01:33:39,728
Get the hell out of here!

1328
01:33:48,744 --> 01:33:50,541
Everybody, please.
Go back to your homes!

1329
01:33:50,712 --> 01:33:52,976
Forget you, man!
See, you a punk!

1330
01:33:53,148 --> 01:33:56,948
You need to back off, please.
Everybody.

1331
01:34:08,563 --> 01:34:09,791
- What is it?
- What?!

1332
01:34:09,965 --> 01:34:12,024
Forget it. Don't...
Put your shit back on!

1333
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:14,896
For your own sakes,
do not let this happen.

1334
01:34:15,070 --> 01:34:17,436
This is not gonna help!

1335
01:34:17,906 --> 01:34:19,897
Come on, SWAT.

1336
01:34:20,809 --> 01:34:22,367
- This is not gonna help!
- Forget it!

1337
01:34:25,914 --> 01:34:27,347
What's wrong with you?

1338
01:34:27,516 --> 01:34:30,781
This is yours.
This is for your family!

1339
01:34:32,154 --> 01:34:35,715
Yeah, I'm coming at you.
Forget y'all, man. Forget y'all!

1340
01:34:35,924 --> 01:34:38,188
Y'all know you ain't
supposed to be doing all this.

1341
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:41,124
That's right. I wish y'all would move
so I could do something.

1342
01:34:41,296 --> 01:34:43,730
I should bust y'all in your face.
You. Forget y'all.

1343
01:34:46,001 --> 01:34:47,559
Get out of here.

1344
01:34:48,437 --> 01:34:51,099
Lorenzo! Lorenzo!

1345
01:34:51,273 --> 01:34:53,400
Why don't you come up
in here now, motherfucker?

1346
01:34:53,575 --> 01:34:55,566
I just saw that nigger
with that bitch's kid.

1347
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:58,713
- Don't let him get away, now.
- That jacker's right under my bed.

1348
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:01,440
- Y'all need a SWAT team.
- Y'all want them to come in here?

1349
01:35:01,616 --> 01:35:04,847
- Hell, yeah.
- No. No, you don't.

1350
01:35:05,020 --> 01:35:07,488
- Man, fuck you!
- Look, you see these cops?

1351
01:35:07,656 --> 01:35:10,489
They are just the tip of the iceberg.

1352
01:35:11,026 --> 01:35:14,462
Every cop in Dempsy and Gannon
is on alert.

1353
01:35:14,629 --> 01:35:18,360
There's a hell of a lot more of them
than there are tenants in here.

1354
01:35:18,533 --> 01:35:20,262
So if this shit jumps off...

1355
01:35:20,569 --> 01:35:23,504
...they gonna turn into
one big-ass police force...

1356
01:35:23,672 --> 01:35:26,197
...that's gonna be in here
kicking down our doors!

1357
01:35:26,374 --> 01:35:28,365
- "Our doors," huh?
- Please.

1358
01:35:28,543 --> 01:35:31,444
What you talking about, man?
You ain't one of us. Come on.

1359
01:35:32,013 --> 01:35:34,277
We ain't tolerating!

1360
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:36,808
Leo?

1361
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:44,850
Oh, so you all concerned
with city lines now and shit.

1362
01:35:45,327 --> 01:35:48,160
You take care of your town,
we'll take care of ours.

1363
01:35:48,763 --> 01:35:50,856
Just get them out of sight, all right?

1364
01:35:51,032 --> 01:35:54,559
You about to start the very thing
you supposed to be here preventing.

1365
01:35:54,736 --> 01:36:00,402
- When they step off, we'll step off.
- No, you step off, then they'll step off.

1366
01:36:03,612 --> 01:36:07,013
Just back them up.
I'll handle my end, all right?

1367
01:36:21,129 --> 01:36:22,790
Everybody play it cool.
Play it cool.

1368
01:36:22,964 --> 01:36:25,194
- Wanna piece of me?
- What the fuck you looking at?

1369
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:30,661
You have a good night now,
you hear.

1370
01:36:38,213 --> 01:36:40,443
Rafik! Rafik!

1371
01:36:40,615 --> 01:36:42,515
- No!
- Can I help you with something?

1372
01:36:44,286 --> 01:36:45,878
No!

1373
01:36:46,221 --> 01:36:47,552
Hey!

1374
01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:50,587
- Come on, Rafik. Rafik!
- Don't do it.

1375
01:36:51,259 --> 01:36:53,420
Don't do it!

1376
01:37:03,305 --> 01:37:05,034
Get him out of here.

1377
01:39:40,128 --> 01:39:41,561
<i>Miss Martin</i>.

1378
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:44,324
<i>I have a charge here</i>
<i>of criminal negligence in the death...</i>

1379
01:39:44,499 --> 01:39:46,967
...of Cody Martin
signed by Detective Lorenzo Council...

1380
01:39:47,135 --> 01:39:48,727
...of the Dempsy Police Department.

1381
01:39:49,237 --> 01:39:52,502
Do you understand
the charge as read to you?

1382
01:39:53,575 --> 01:39:55,566
Miss Martin?

1383
01:39:57,412 --> 01:39:59,573
How's your reception, counselor?
Can you see us?

1384
01:39:59,748 --> 01:40:01,716
<i>Yes, we can, Your Honor</i>.

1385
01:40:01,883 --> 01:40:03,214
Miss Martin?

1386
01:40:03,985 --> 01:40:06,249
Do you understand the charge?

1387
01:40:14,763 --> 01:40:16,628
Yes.

1388
01:40:53,001 --> 01:40:55,435
They gave us some deluxe
elbow room in here, huh?

1389
01:41:02,343 --> 01:41:04,436
So they got you
in protective custody, huh?

1390
01:41:04,612 --> 01:41:06,512
On suicide watch too.

1391
01:41:07,215 --> 01:41:09,183
It's just standard procedure.

1392
01:41:13,087 --> 01:41:16,113
You know, you aren't the only person
I got to visit in here today.

1393
01:41:16,291 --> 01:41:18,054
My son, Jason...

1394
01:41:19,227 --> 01:41:22,219
...he's over in the state wing
doing two to four for armed robbery.

1395
01:41:22,397 --> 01:41:23,921
No.

1396
01:41:24,098 --> 01:41:26,191
- Used my gun too.
- Oh, no.

1397
01:41:26,367 --> 01:41:27,959
Yeah.

1398
01:41:28,303 --> 01:41:30,134
All my friends say to me:

1399
01:41:30,305 --> 01:41:33,900
"Lorenzo, it ain't your fault
that boy landed where he did.

1400
01:41:34,075 --> 01:41:36,737
He got to take responsibility
for that his own self.

1401
01:41:36,911 --> 01:41:40,074
I ain't seen no pacifier in his mouth
the last 10 years."

1402
01:41:40,248 --> 01:41:43,979
Well, between you and me,
it is my fault.

1403
01:41:44,786 --> 01:41:48,654
I do feel responsible
because the kind of man he is...

1404
01:41:48,823 --> 01:41:51,587
...is the kind of man
I showed him how to be.

1405
01:41:51,759 --> 01:41:54,227
High all the time.

1406
01:41:54,395 --> 01:41:57,296
Selfish. Out of control.

1407
01:41:57,465 --> 01:41:59,524
I was never there
on a day-to-day basis.

1408
01:41:59,701 --> 01:42:02,966
And when I was,
I was fighting with his moms.

1409
01:42:04,739 --> 01:42:07,674
Yeah, well, that's who I was.

1410
01:42:08,409 --> 01:42:10,377
I'm so sorry.

1411
01:42:12,647 --> 01:42:14,512
Back then...

1412
01:42:14,949 --> 01:42:17,213
...I just didn't give a shit.

1413
01:42:17,886 --> 01:42:19,183
Now Jason's in prison...

1414
01:42:19,721 --> 01:42:23,851
...and he'll probably be in and out
of prison the rest of his life.

1415
01:42:24,125 --> 01:42:25,990
It's kind of late in the game...

1416
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:28,560
...but all I wanna do now
is be there for him.

1417
01:42:31,399 --> 01:42:33,196
But with kids...

1418
01:42:33,368 --> 01:42:37,634
...no matter what you did or how bad
you think you messed up...

1419
01:42:37,805 --> 01:42:41,400
...God always finds a way
to give you another shot at it.

1420
01:42:41,576 --> 01:42:44,272
It might not be
with that particular child, but...

1421
01:42:47,615 --> 01:42:50,778
What I'm trying to say, Brenda...

1422
01:42:50,985 --> 01:42:54,785
...is that God's grace
is sort of, like, retroactive.

1423
01:42:54,956 --> 01:42:58,722
So every little kid out there
is Jason for me now.

1424
01:42:59,394 --> 01:43:02,727
And, no, they're not my blood,
but I can live with that.

1425
01:43:02,897 --> 01:43:05,832
And I'm happy. My life is good.

1426
01:43:09,103 --> 01:43:11,094
There's a lot of young women
in here, Brenda.

1427
01:43:11,272 --> 01:43:15,606
Some of them are good mothers,
some ain't. But they all need help.

1428
01:43:15,777 --> 01:43:20,373
On visitors' day, in the nursery,
even in prenatal.

1429
01:43:20,548 --> 01:43:23,108
And the warden in here
is an old running buddy of mine...

1430
01:43:23,284 --> 01:43:24,615
I love you.

1431
01:43:24,986 --> 01:43:26,283
What?

1432
01:43:26,454 --> 01:43:29,685
I love you for the way
you talk to me.

1433
01:43:30,124 --> 01:43:32,251
I've loved you
for the way you talk to me...

1434
01:43:32,427 --> 01:43:34,759
...ever since I first met you
in the hospital.

1435
01:43:36,431 --> 01:43:38,160
I wish I had your heart.

1436
01:43:42,604 --> 01:43:47,667
Look, I don't know if your lawyer
is gonna do a plea bargain...

1437
01:43:47,842 --> 01:43:50,367
...or whatever,
or if you're going to trial.

1438
01:43:50,545 --> 01:43:53,981
But you'll still be a young woman.
Lots of things that you can...

1439
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:02,118
I'll... I'll...
I'll come see you.

1440
01:44:02,757 --> 01:44:04,122
Brenda...

1441
01:44:04,292 --> 01:44:07,125
...reach out to people in here,
all right?

1442
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:34,611
Jas, how you doing?

1443
01:44:34,789 --> 01:44:36,814
Wasn't you just here
on Tuesday, man?

1444
01:44:37,859 --> 01:44:39,224
You want me to leave?

1445
01:44:40,461 --> 01:44:42,986
No, it's all good.
It's Christmas in July.

1446
01:44:44,132 --> 01:44:46,692
So like I said,
how you doing, kid?

1447
01:44:47,035 --> 01:44:49,663
You know, the Aryan Nation
was asking me to hook up...

1448
01:44:49,837 --> 01:44:53,466
...but I was a little bit nervous about
the whole initiation thing, you know?

1449
01:45:01,015 --> 01:45:03,848
Hey, Dad, you..? You okay?

1450
01:45:06,187 --> 01:45:07,779
Yeah.

1451
01:45:08,923 --> 01:45:10,754
Yeah, I'm good.

1452
01:45:12,293 --> 01:45:14,022
I'm real good.

1453
01:45:22,503 --> 01:45:25,267
- So, what you think?
- I was looking at that.

1454
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,101
What's going on with you?

1455
01:45:27,275 --> 01:45:29,641
You know, out there
roughnecking.

1456
01:45:29,811 --> 01:45:33,303
- So you fell off your bed.
- Yeah, right...

1457
01:45:52,567 --> 01:45:55,035
I thought you should see this.

1458
01:45:57,205 --> 01:45:58,536
Hey.

1459
01:46:01,809 --> 01:46:04,277
You know that thing
with the carjacker?

1460
01:46:05,012 --> 01:46:08,539
I know I'm supposed to find it
in my heart to forgive.

1461
01:46:08,716 --> 01:46:10,206
But...

1462
01:46:12,053 --> 01:46:14,453
And her with Billy.

1463
01:46:14,622 --> 01:46:16,852
I mean, he wasn't getting none
from me, so...

1464
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:24,627
But, Lorenzo, did he have anything
to do with hurting that child?

1465
01:46:26,501 --> 01:46:28,594
No. No, he didn't.

1466
01:46:32,807 --> 01:46:36,038
Thank you. Thank you.

1467
01:47:35,703 --> 01:47:38,604
"This child's life was not in vain.

1468
01:47:39,507 --> 01:47:42,772
He brought us together
in a common bond of sadness.

1469
01:47:43,377 --> 01:47:46,175
He reminded us
how human we are...

1470
01:47:47,114 --> 01:47:50,811
...and how hurt and pain
touches us all.

1471
01:47:51,485 --> 01:47:56,422
Go to God, little angel.
And thank you."

1472
01:48:22,216 --> 01:48:24,912
I really appreciate you bringing
me out here, Bobby.

1473
01:48:25,086 --> 01:48:26,883
I truly do.
