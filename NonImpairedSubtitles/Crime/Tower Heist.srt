1
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,487
Good morning, New York.

2
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:29,125
<i>Today we are talking about
cheese until the sun comes up.</i>

3
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,499
<i>Specifically, bouchon cheese.</i>

4
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:35,267
<i>I like to pair this with a
nice '77 sauvignon blanc.</i>

5
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,802
<i>It's perfect for an intimate
meal or for a large gathering.</i>

6
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,355
<i>You will never go wrong
with semi-soft cheeses.</i>

7
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,984
<i>Let us go to Scott
in Crown Heights.</i>

8
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,551
<i>He has been
wondering about Brie.</i>

9
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,696
<i>NASDAQ
dropped its noisy effort</i>

10
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,891
<i>to take over the New
York Stock Exchange.</i>

11
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,730
<i>It slunk away
saying it became clear</i>

12
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,827
<i>regulators wouldn't
approve a merger</i>

13
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,634
<i>of the US's two dominant
stock exchanges.</i>

14
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,769
<i>I think
we have Barbara in the Bronx.</i>

15
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,175
<i>She's got a question
about cheddar.</i>

16
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,907
<i>Go ahead, Barbara.</i>

17
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,879
You can have my rook,
but I will take

18
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,878
that.

19
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,845
Boom.

20
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,717
<i>It seems investors
may be in for an equally wild ride.</i>

21
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,828
Get that bike around
back Come on, empty the truck.

22
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,392
Hey, it's the man in the suit.
Hey.

23
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,938
What are you doing walking
on my side of the street?

24
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,029
Very funny.

25
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,768
Punk-ass bitches walk on the
other side of the street.

26
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,934
Same jokes as yesterday.

27
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,909
Walk by me again and I'm
going to whoop your ass.

28
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:28,309
Good morning, Mr. Shaw.
You are looking lean and mean today.

29
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,047
This is why I love you, Lester.

30
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,747
You're the best
liar in New York.

31
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,256
Morning, Mr. Shaw.
Hiya.

32
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,656
Everything is set
for your dinner party

33
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,593
I'm sending up some bouchon paired
with a '77 sauvignon blanc.

34
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,787
Very nice.

35
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,495
If you don't mind my saying,
are you sure you want.

36
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,931
Secretary Lowe and Janet
Ramsey at the party together?

37
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,366
They were mentioned
again on Page Six.

38
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,201
Jesus! I totally forgot
they were screwing.

39
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,967
Yeah.
Nice save, Josh.

40
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,234
What the hell
would I do without you?

41
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,971
You would have to
read the Post yourself.

42
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,635
No, I'm serious.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,775
I am kicking the tires
on a couple deals.

44
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,337
I might buy a hotel
in Saint Bart's.

45
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,776
I'm looking for a GM.

46
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,340
I'm going to try
and steal you away.

47
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,180
If I could bring Lester,
we might have a deal.

48
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,152
Okay, deal.

49
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,650
All right.
Have a good one.

50
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,192
Josh, one more thing.

51
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,318
What is that, sir?

52
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,884
Checkmate.

53
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,225
You got a security
report for me?

54
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,795
Not much, Mr. K. A car alarm, two
homeless and a really loud dog.

55
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,397
Good morning, Josh.
Hey, Rose.

56
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,669
How was your weekend?

57
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,904
Good. I was here.
We steam-cleaned the garage,

58
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,673
had some killer take-out
from Punjab Palace.

59
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,408
You are a wild man.
That's me.

60
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,778
Mr. K.

61
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,139
Hey, Odessa.

62
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,618
My work visa's about to expire.
You must find me a husband.

63
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,381
Okay. Can I have
my bagel first?

64
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,448
I need a man before these pricks
throw me out of the country.

65
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,188
All right, and what about Manuel?
He's a catch.

66
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,227
I tried.
He couldn't handle me.

67
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,596
Okay. Rose,
don't write that down.

68
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:52,932
Morning.
Morning, Kwan.

69
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,030
We have birthdays
in 3714 and 4399.

70
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,004
The Jameson twins like the
cupcakes from Magnolia,

71
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,512
Mr. Causwell likes the hot
fudge sundae at Sardi's.

72
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,673
And Mrs. Hightower
landed three days early

73
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,182
from Cairo, be here in an hour.

74
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,274
Does Mr. Hightower know?

75
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,251
Josh, a word, right now.

76
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,084
Yes, sir, Mr. Simon.

77
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,382
Where's Charlie?
I got an empty concierge desk.

78
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,086
I think he's checking
on Mrs. Cronan.

79
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,892
Now that's bullshit!
Mrs. Cronan is at physical therapy.

80
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,761
He has got three minutes.

81
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,361
Can only be convicted if the
prosecution proves all the...

82
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,529
Miss lovenko.

83
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,663
Holy shit! What?

84
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,068
We do this thing, you and I,

85
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,608
where you pretend not to
study for the bar exam

86
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,768
and I pretend not to notice.

87
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,136
I'm sorry, I don't know what
you're talking about, sir.

88
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,713
See, we're doing it.
Doing what?

89
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,407
Right now, we're doing the thing,
where you pretend not...

90
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,472
No.

91
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,610
I know the exam is coming up
this week, so study in my office

92
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,312
during your lunch break, okay?
Because I never use it.

93
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,788
Okay, but I'm not studying, so
it would not make much sense.

94
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,121
Wait. Shh! Hear that?

95
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,350
Someone is buzzing.

96
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,962
Hey, shush!

97
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,089
Everybody, shush!

98
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,356
Who's buzzing?

99
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,631
I hear it.
It's faint,

100
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,962
it's muffled, but I hear it.
Fess up!

101
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,199
Who's buzzing?
Come on!

102
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,433
Who the hell is buzzing?

103
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,999
It's me, my bad.
I had it on vibrate.

104
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,335
Josh, this is
Enrique Dev'Reaux.

105
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,778
He's our new elevator operator.

106
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:10,837
I didn't hire you.

107
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,008
He's a quarter Cherokee,
you know we need an Indian.

108
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,517
So give him a shot.

109
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,277
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Mr. Kovaks.

110
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,482
I've spent the last three
years working at the BK,

111
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,990
and I'm ready for
the big leagues.

112
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,051
BK? What is that?
A building downtown?

113
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:25,192
No, it's a Burger King
in Times Square.

114
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,094
All right.
Walk with me, Mr. Dev'Reaux.

115
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,158
The average apartment at The
Tower costs $5.6 million.

116
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,602
It's the most expensive real
estate in North America.

117
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,105
We have the best views, the
most advanced security system,

118
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,837
keyless entry, 24-hour
video vibration detection.

119
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,401
But you know what these
people are really buying?

120
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:43,772
White neighbors?

121
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,315
Us. The staff.

122
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,181
They pay for our full and undivided
attention seven days a week.

123
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,187
So there's no
cell phones, iPhones,

124
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,881
blackberries,
texting, tweeting...

125
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,117
They had a rule at the BK,
no sex in the storage room.

126
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,523
Same as your phone rule, right?

127
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,128
No, not the same,
because your dick

128
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,664
has to come with you
to work, Mr. Dev'Reaux,

129
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,700
but your phone
can stay at home.

130
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,099
So don't hide it in your pocket
or tuck it into your sock,

131
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,933
don't tape it under your balls
or stick it up your ass,

132
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,904
because, eventually,
I will find it.

133
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,972
They never checked
my balls at the BK.

134
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,642
Sir, you can call me "Enrique" or "Lil'
Disco" or "The Puerto Rican Mohican,"

135
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:17,874
that's my hip-hop name.

136
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,115
Morning, Judge Ramos.
How did you do?

137
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,053
I ran the Reservoir, 15 flat.

138
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,146
Nice.

139
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,555
Where's Charlie?
I need my cigars.

140
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,524
I think he took Mrs
. Cronan to physical therapy

141
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,720
I'll bring them up
the second he gets here.

142
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,853
Thank you.

143
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:32,988
- Hey, Lester.
- Good morning, Lester.

144
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,053
Hi, Lester.

145
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,862
What's invisible
and smells like worms?

146
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,425
Bird farts.

147
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,065
We've heard that one before.

148
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,434
Have a great day at school.

149
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,068
Morning,
Mr. Hightower.

150
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,266
Ma'am.

151
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,235
Sir, that package you ordered from
Cairo arrived three days early.

152
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,575
Hmm.
Yeah.

153
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,410
It's on its way from
the airport right now.

154
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,575
Josh, can you
have the chauffeur

155
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,844
pick us up at the back, please?

156
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,510
Already done.
Thank you.

157
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,248
Darling, let's go.

158
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,953
That guy's daughter
looks like a prostitute.

159
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,653
We're all about discretion
here, Mr. Dev'Reaux.

160
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,361
Right, right.
How do you guys split up the tips?

161
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,229
We don't. We never
take tips at The Tower.

162
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,562
No, I don't really want to
talk about it right now.

163
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,227
- Charlie.
- Sasha!

164
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,698
Your brother's coming, I'm at
work and I can't talk right now.

165
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,639
You're 20 minutes late!
Where are Judge Ramos' cigars?

166
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:18,767
Right here.

167
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,972
Josh, I'm freaking out.

168
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,605
Can I help you?

169
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,738
Go.

170
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:24,804
What?

171
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,181
We just went to the OB/GYN, the
baby is in the third trimester,

172
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,652
its head is six inches wide,
your sister has a tiny vagina.

173
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,389
Everyone tells me to stop worrying.
I said, "Stop worrying?"

174
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,981
In labor its head is
going to get crushed

175
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,787
or it's going to blow
out your sister's vagina.

176
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,088
Don't say the
"V" word in the lobby.

177
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,150
I called your Uncle Marty.

178
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,289
He said all the women in your
family have teeny tiny vaginae.

179
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,592
I've been covering
your ass all week.

180
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:44,862
Simon is
breathing down my neck.

181
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,904
What are you doing?
 I'm worried.

182
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,303
Did you hear what I was saying?
Simon is going to fire you.

183
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,441
Simon is not going to fire me today.
I got the red flowers.

184
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,533
Red flowers?

185
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,634
Yeah, it's Chinese New Year.

186
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,077
Mrs. Jin will be
down here any second.

187
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,979
It's crucial the first thing she
hears be something positive.

188
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,176
Her entire year depends on it.

189
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,208
Mrs. Jin.

190
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,587
Happy New Year.

191
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,794
Did you see that smile?

192
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,397
Wanted to see me?

193
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,567
Yeah.

194
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,411
Fitzhugh is refusing to leave.

195
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,209
We've never had a forced
eviction at The Tower.

196
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,541
If they drag Mr. Fitzhugh and
his family into the street,

197
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,710
it's bad for all of us.

198
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,144
Why don't you talk to him?

199
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,448
This is your
responsibility, Josh.

200
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,251
The bank comes in the morning.
Get him out.

201
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,691
Mr. Fitzhugh,
it's Josh Kovaks, sir.

202
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,166
Good morning, Josh.
Are you alone?

203
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,233
Yeah.

204
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,480
Hey, did you see what
the market did today?

205
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:16,254
Went up 106 points.
Ask me why it did that?

206
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,350
Why?

207
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,657
I don't know,
but I used to know.

208
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,392
That's why they hired
me at Merrill Lynch.

209
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,594
Mr. Fitzhugh, you know this
apartment is now owned by the bank.

210
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,228
They'd like you to
vacate immediately.

211
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,102
We told the kids that we
were turning the apartment

212
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,868
into a park.
Going green.

213
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,800
That's how we explained
all the furniture

214
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,243
being sold and the tents
in the living room.

215
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,839
Luckily, my children aren't
very bright, so they bought it.

216
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,885
But they have smart friends and
those friends are catching on.

217
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,285
Sir, the bank will be
here tomorrow morning.

218
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,654
I went to Yale 20 years ago,
and now I'm a squatter.

219
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:52,385
Can't wait for their reunion.
"Hello, nice to see you. I squat."

220
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,457
What about family?

221
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,295
No, I invested all their money.
They won't return my calls.

222
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:01,600
I'd sleep in my car, but they
repossessed it three months ago.

223
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,231
So, you see,
I have to stay here,

224
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,772
because we have
nowhere else to go.

225
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,539
It's illegal for you to be here.
You're committing a crime.

226
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,978
I understand that.

227
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:17,377
But we might be doing some
elevator maintenance tomorrow.

228
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,285
I'm thinking that the
elevators will be shut down

229
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:27,458
and those people from the bank will
just have to come back another time.

230
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,937
because,
it's like you go down one.

231
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,434
Hey, Mr. Kovaks.

232
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,176
Mr. Shaw, I see you
met Mr. Dev'Reaux.

233
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:45,238
This guy owns his own island with jet skis.
How cool is that?

234
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,908
He's our probationary
elevator operator.

235
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,815
He's still very early
in the interview process.

236
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,320
Why don't we finish the job
interview right now, Josh?

237
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,124
Suppose I ask you to pick
me up a cheeseburger,

238
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,488
Enrique, what would you say?

239
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,993
How do you like it cooked?

240
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,586
The thing is, I like a certain
kind of Brie on my burger,

241
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,189
and they only sell it at
Danny's Cheese Shop downtown.

242
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,824
I'm on my way.

243
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,426
And the beef has
to be grass-fed.

244
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,572
The best butcher shop in New
York is on Bleecker Street, sir.

245
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,201
Josh, hire him.

246
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,005
Yes, that was my gut, sir.

247
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,137
And, Enrique, one other thing

248
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,375
I like to get my own
burgers whenever possible.

249
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,676
I may have my own
private island in Belize,

250
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,687
but deep down I'm just an
Astoria boy like Josh here.

251
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,017
We come from
the same neighborhood.

252
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,250
That's right, PS 104. Go Lions!

253
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:31,756
My first real job was shoveling
horseshit at Aqueduct Racetrack.

254
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,524
Don't you ever let me forget it.

255
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,860
I won't, sir.

256
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,328
All right, go downstairs
and get a nametag from Rose.

257
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,338
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

258
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,803
Why don't we hit it tonight, Josh?
Raise some hell.

259
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,974
We have to be back
here in nine hours.

260
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,041
Remember that time you danced
on that bar in Times Square?

261
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,415
I almost fainted.

262
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,887
That's a drunken dream
you had six years ago.

263
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,153
You were shaking your ass
up there like Tina Turner.

264
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,455
Running half naked on Broadway

265
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,657
<i>telling tourists you were Mustafa
from The Lion King.</i>

266
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,165
That's ridiculous.
It never happened.

267
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:13,567
I was waiting to tell you.
This is going to be my last year at The Tower.

268
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,661
What?

269
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,900
In a few months,
I'm headed to San Diego

270
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,669
to spend a little
time with Lorraine.

271
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,871
I might even cruise around the world
with all the other old farts.

272
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,772
Wow.

273
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,547
That's great. That's really great.
I'm going to miss you.

274
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,544
I'll bethinking
about you, Josh.

275
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,951
Here's your bus.

276
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,286
Be thinking about how
you danced on that bar.

277
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,291
Yeah!
I got it all up here.

278
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,951
I don't know
where you got that.

279
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,155
Circle of life, Josh.
Circle of life!

280
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,594
<i>Not many of you
kill your own Thanksgiving turkey,</i>

281
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,265
<i>but you might
want to consider it.</i>

282
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,839
Shit, Rita,
get your ass back in here!

283
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:53,968
I ain't going to be
chasing you all around.

284
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,137
Goodbye, Slide!

285
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,908
Hey, hey, Rita, come on now,
it's 5:30 in the morning.

286
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,505
Not little shit like this.
Come on now

287
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,107
I told you, I don't even
know nobody named Maria.

288
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,879
Yeah, well, she sure as
shit knows you, Slide!

289
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:02,942
It was a wrong number.

290
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,113
Then why did she ask
for you, stupid? Why?

291
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,918
It was a wrong number!
I just...

292
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,423
I don't know what
you are saying, bitch!

293
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,768
Lester, it's 9:15.
Why is Mr. Shaw's car still here?

294
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:20,826
Maybe he's sick.

295
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,167
That black sedan has been
parked there for two days.

296
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,876
Why no boot or ticket?

297
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,207
I called the cops twice.

298
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,552
Do you remember
that morning robbery

299
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,955
at the International last year?

300
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,551
I want you to slowly lock the
door and clear the lobby.

301
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,719
Stay calm.

302
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,432
Lock it down.
Code Black on all doors and elevators.

303
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,233
Repeat, Code Black.

304
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,799
What's Code Black?

305
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,408
Are you serious? We talked about
it at the meeting last month.

306
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,944
Let me see the outside
of the building.

307
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,035
I think we're
about to be robbed.

308
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,103
There were four guys
out there with guns.

309
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,440
Where did they go?

310
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,106
Let me see the garage.

311
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,317
Why is Stillman here?
Laundry pick-up was yesterday.

312
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,219
Mr. Shaw asked us
to call him.

313
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,155
Someone spilled wine
on his tablecloth.

314
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,193
He's bringing it
down right now.

315
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,660
Wait a second.
Those are not the Stillman brothers.

316
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,330
Oh, my God,
they're taking Shaw.

317
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,925
This isn't a robbery,
it's a kidnapping.

318
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,628
It's a kidnapping!
Call 911!

319
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,693
Yes, sir.

320
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,830
Code Black, Manuel!
Code Black!

321
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:29,895
What's Code Black?

322
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,304
Hey! Whoa!
Whoa!

323
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,868
Hey! Stop!

324
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,145
Shoot at the tires!

325
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,583
I only have my Taser!

326
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,684
Hey, stop!

327
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,942
Watch out!

328
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,443
Move in!
Move in! Move in!

329
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,275
Don't move.

330
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,853
Get
your hands in the air!

331
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,484
FBI, show me your hands.

332
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,628
- Let's go.
- Okay, all right.

333
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,061
Put them behind your back!

334
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,120
Take it easy.

335
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,695
No, get off him!
He's the victim!

336
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,766
That's Arthur Shaw!
He lives in The Tower.

337
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,237
He was bringing his laundry down.
They kidnapped him.

338
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,434
This was not a kidnapping,
it was an attempt to flee.

339
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:39,732
What?

340
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,038
Arrest him and get
him out of here.

341
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,440
Josh, do me a favor, turn off
the heater and cover the pool.

342
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,007
I hate to waste money.

343
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,025
<i>Wall Street
kingpin Arthur Shaw,</i>

344
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,721
<i>number 138 on
the Forbes 400 last year,</i>

345
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:02,129
<i>was arrested today in Manhattan
while trying to flee the city.</i>

346
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,292
<i>Sources have confirmed
that he'll be charged</i>

347
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,358
<i>with several counts
of securities fraud</i>

348
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,804
<i>and an immediate asset freeze of Mr.
Shaw's holdings has been ordered.</i>

349
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,138
<i>Shaw's lawyers
have called the arrest</i>

350
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,302
<i>"another example of the
Wall Street witch-hunt, "</i>

351
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,607
<i>but sources at the SEC
believe the fraud</i>

352
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,376
<i>in this case could be
of epic proportions.</i>

353
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,115
In this country you're
innocent until proven guilty,

354
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:28,488
so no matter what you hear about
Mr. Shaw being a liar and a cheat,

355
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,255
or his entire business being
some sort of elaborate scam,

356
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,818
we simply don't
know the truth yet

357
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,762
I've got shoes
to polish, Mr. K.

358
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,356
What does this
got to do with us?

359
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,232
For the last six years, Mr. Shaw
was on the board of The Tower.

360
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,602
So we have to find
a new board member?

361
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,102
No.

362
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,303
Several years ago at
one of the meetings,

363
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,141
he was asked to
do a favor for us.

364
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,112
He was asked to manage
all of your pensions.

365
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,171
Pensions?

366
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,477
And he did.

367
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,519
He took us on even though
it was a small account.

368
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,951
He agreed to handle it.

369
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,946
Who asked him to do that?

370
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,291
I did, Rose.
I asked him.

371
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,187
Mr. K, what's left
in the pension?

372
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,164
Kwan, all this just happened,
so there's no way of knowing,

373
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,759
and by the way,
this could be a mistake.

374
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,169
How much, Josh?
Tell us.

375
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,501
Right now, they're
saying that anyone who

376
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,476
invested with Mr. Shaw
has been defrauded,

377
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,474
and that more than
likely, it's all gone.

378
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,280
There is no pension.

379
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,874
Wait, wait. Wait a minute.
I'm sorry.

380
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,385
How did this happen?

381
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,981
The guy is the best in New York

382
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,886
and he promised he could
triple our portfolio.

383
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,015
So they're going
to get our money?

384
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,717
The guy had billions
of dollars, right?

385
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,885
Of course,
it's just a matter of time.

386
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:41,591
So we have to stay patient and be
positive, because it has to be there.

387
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,655
I heard on the news
when they arrested Shaw

388
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,702
that he only had $600
in his checking account.

389
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,006
Look, some of you may need
some time to process this.

390
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,132
If anyone wants to go home,

391
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,733
I will call in a temp crew
for the rest of the day.

392
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,006
I'm sure that this will all
be cleared up tomorrow.

393
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,742
Can I ask you
something, Mr. K?

394
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,838
Yeah.

395
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,577
Did he get your money, too?

396
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,017
Yeah, Odessa.

397
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,546
For the record

398
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,524
I never asked anyone
to triple my portfolio.

399
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,393
<i>Just an hour ago,</i>

400
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:19,459
<i>a federal judge released Arthur
Shaw on $10 million bail,</i>

401
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:23,530
<i>on condition he remain under house
arrest at his penthouse apartment</i>

402
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,700
<i>on Central Park West.</i>

403
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:26,970
Mr. Shaw, I need
a statement from you.

404
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,033
You need to back off.

405
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,376
Can I get a comment
please, Mr. Shaw?

406
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,711
You need to back off.
Excuse me.

407
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:36,218
Here! Over here!
Come on, Shaw! Right here! Shaw!

408
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,380
Shaw, can we get a picture?

409
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,124
Over here, Mr. Shaw!

410
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,064
We're taking Shaw and his
attorney up to the penthouse.

411
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,031
I need Mr. Shaw's
personal security code.

412
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,897
24719.

413
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:56,463
That was my street address on Steinway
Boulevard in Astoria when I was a kid.

414
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,971
My client would like
access to the gym on 43.

415
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,244
Even serial killers get 15
minutes of exercise a day.

416
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,285
He has my permission
to jump out the window.

417
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,647
The rules of Mr. Shaw's
house arrest are simple.

418
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,919
Kovaks, no visitors without
prior permission from the FBI.

419
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,722
All incoming and outgoing mail
gets vetted by my office.

420
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,490
All food deliveries, packages,

421
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,361
cleaning, repairs, all that has to
be cleared by the agent on duty.

422
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,594
You tell your staff
that this penthouse is now

423
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,102
a maximum security prison and
it will be guarded as such.

424
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,605
The FBI is in control of the
elevator and this floor.

425
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,940
What the hell is this?

426
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:38,780
Agent Denham, that is
a 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso,

427
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:42,250
owned and raced by the coolest cat
who ever lived, Steve McQueen.

428
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,285
This was his baby,

429
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,720
and now it's my baby.

430
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,951
You got Steve McQueen's car
parked in your living room?

431
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,222
And here I thought
you were an asshole.

432
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,127
I paid a million
for it 10 years ago.

433
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,132
I wouldn't sell it
for 10 times that.

434
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,566
We're 65 stories up.
How do we get it out of here?

435
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,135
You don't.

436
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,331
This car was taken
apart piece by piece

437
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,873
and reassembled
inside this room.

438
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,100
This car will eventually
be sold at auction

439
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,700
with the rest of
your belongings.

440
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,043
Only if I'm guilty Agent
Denham, which I'm not.

441
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:17,016
If you leave this apartment for
any reason without my say so,

442
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,884
and you'll be remanded
into federal custody

443
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,185
and forfeit $10 million bail.

444
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,693
You have yourself
a nice day, Mr. Shaw.

445
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,320
Kovaks, will you come with me?

446
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,796
Josh, do me a favor, will you?

447
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,725
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.

448
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,268
Make sure you handle
all my food deliveries.

449
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,928
You're smart enough
to know I'm innocent.

450
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,732
I don't want the help
to spit in my coffee.

451
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:38,969
They wouldn't do that, sir.

452
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,906
Yeah, but you get it, right?

453
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,010
Do it as a favor to me.

454
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,282
Sorry, we don't accept
tips at The Tower.

455
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,784
Right, I'm sorry.
Sometimes I forget the rules.

456
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,553
Why did you let
him get away with that?

457
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,157
When he made that crack about the
help spitting in his coffee.

458
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,792
You wanted to hurt him.
Hell, I wanted to hurt him.

459
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,997
Sometimes residents say things they don't mean.
It doesn't faze me.

460
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,734
Either that or
you got no balls.

461
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:11,831
What?

462
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,776
I'm out of line.
I'm sorry.

463
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,311
I have balls, all right.

464
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,040
I'm sure you got
big balls. Whatever.

465
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,446
I don't have to
defend my balls to you.

466
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,314
I'm just saying the guy stole from
everyone who works in your building

467
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,853
and it looked like you
gave him a free pass.

468
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,786
Maybe next time I'll
rip out his larynx,

469
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,791
but today I chose to do my job
as manager of this building.

470
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,149
Okay, my mistake, Kovaks.

471
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,730
Just that most guys from
your block in Astoria

472
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:34,889
can't control themselves.

473
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,297
And most girls from Forest
Hills don't end up in the FBI.

474
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,664
That's where
you're from, right?

475
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,003
Here.

476
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,604
This is where most white-collar
crimes are solved, the garbage.

477
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,877
When do you think you will
be getting the money back?

478
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,112
I'm not really allowed to
discuss the case with you.

479
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,120
But you're allowed
to clothesline me?

480
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,883
I was apprehending a fugitive.

481
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,152
He's only a fugitive
if he's guilty, right?

482
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,318
Oh!

483
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,690
Aren't you the loyal friend?

484
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,489
I never said we were friends.

485
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,122
You play chess together,

486
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,098
you're the one who asked
him to invest the pension.

487
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:14,503
I get his mail,
I open his car door,

488
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,630
I buy his cheese.
We're not friends.

489
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,339
Let me ask you something,
Kovaks.

490
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,604
If he's innocent,
where's the money?

491
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:21,735
How should I know?

492
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:25,675
The same way you knew
I was from Forest Hills.

493
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,011
You pay attention.

494
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,015
I just want to know what I'm
supposed to tell my staff.

495
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,257
Is that too much to ask?

496
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,192
Tell them he's guilty.

497
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,528
Get on the car!

498
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,964
Hey! Hey, hey!

499
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,968
Come on, put
your hands behind your back!

500
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,435
Come on, man,
what's this about?

501
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,438
This is bullshit! Shit!
That's police brutality, yo!

502
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,037
Come on now.

503
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,541
Man in the suit,
you seeing this shit?

504
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,099
You're my witness.
Take a cell phone picture.

505
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,645
Take a picture, man.

506
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,373
No, my cell phone
doesn't have a camera.

507
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,875
If you see Rita, tell her I
said to call her brother.

508
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,645
Rita? Yeah, her brother's
a bail bondsman.

509
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:02,810
Tell her I said
to use that money

510
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,512
I gave her to get
her teeth fixed.

511
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,453
Come on now, what you got
to be pushing me like that?

512
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:17,195
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, the next Brooklyn bound</i>

513
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,099
<i>local train is now arriving.</i>

514
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,900
<i>Please step away
from the platform edge,</i>

515
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:27,341
<i>especially when trains are
entering and leaving the station.</i>

516
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,459
Hello.

517
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,798
<i>Dr. Carr, dial 118, please.</i>

518
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,539
Hey, what happened?

519
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,768
Lester tried to step in front
of a subway train tonight.

520
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,640
An off-duty
traffic cop was there

521
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,304
and pulled him back
at the last second.

522
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,211
They have him on
a 48-hour hold.

523
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,305
Where is he?

524
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,963
If you wanted a sick day,
all you had to do was ask.

525
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,133
Seriously, I need
you back at work.

526
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,767
I'm going to tell the
doctor somebody pushed you.

527
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,500
It was a misunderstanding,
okay?

528
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,602
I gave it to him, Josh.
All my money.

529
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,703
I asked him to
invest it for me.

530
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,976
Shaw?
Yeah.

531
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:43,242
A couple of months ago, I gave him
everything I had, my life savings.

532
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,810
Six years working the back door

533
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,947
at the Waldorf,
nine at the Carlyle,

534
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,618
three at the Pierre,
11 with you at The Tower.

535
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,860
That's 29 years
of opening doors.

536
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:56,365
$73,000 and change,
and I gave him every penny.

537
00:25:57,355 --> 00:26:00,063
In a few months I won't
have money for rent.

538
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,561
I can't retire now.

539
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:07,334
All those years of opening
doors, year after year.

540
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,977
Truth is, people can
open their own doors.

541
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,909
Not the way you do it.

542
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,183
Lester, he's going to pay
you back every penny.

543
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,355
I promise.

544
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,628
Josh, please calm down.

545
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:29,688
Hold the elevator.

546
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,324
You can't go up there.

547
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,093
You're acting like a vigilante.
Move your hand.

548
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:34,398
I won't move my hand.
Move your hand!

549
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:35,870
Relax. You're not
using your head.

550
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,304
Hey, Charlie.
Hey, Josh.

551
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,432
Hey.

552
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,635
So, they're evicting
me this morning.

553
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,701
My wife already took the
kids, wants a divorce.

554
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,474
So, if you need me,
I'll be living in this box.

555
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,948
Can I ask you a question?
You're a Wall Street guy.

556
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,746
When did Shaw realize
that it was over for him?

557
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,650
Ten months, maybe a year.

558
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,951
I heard he was interviewing
lawyers over the summer.

559
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,314
So if he took someone's
money a few months ago?

560
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,025
Probably needed the cash
to keep up appearances.

561
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,589
Throw his famous Labor
Day party at the beach.

562
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,100
At a certain point, it isn't
about securities fraud,

563
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,191
it's about catering.

564
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,904
Drop Mr. Fitzhugh on 59.

565
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,204
I'm going to the penthouse.

566
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,337
Wow! This is
going to be good.

567
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:21,239
Don't get up. Whoa!
Where do you think you're going?

568
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,979
We're just going
to get the trash.

569
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,918
And the breakfast order.

570
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,250
Go ahead.

571
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,149
Takes a village.

572
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,490
Good morning, Josh, Charlie, Enrique.
How are you doing?

573
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,729
How was your Labor Day
party this year, Mr. Shaw?

574
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,363
Must have been something, huh?
What did you serve? Crab legs?

575
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,907
Surf and turf?

576
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:48,206
I've always tried to extend
you a certain courtesy,

577
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,768
but this tone you're using...

578
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,905
What tone? Who gives
a shit about my tone?

579
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,207
What are you, some
kind of tone master?

580
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,885
Josh, come on.
I'm going to ask you one time, okay?

581
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,750
So you better
think really hard.

582
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,380
Why did you take
Lester's money?

583
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:09,387
He came to me, he asked me to
invest and I did. It was a favor.

584
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,094
Mm-hmm. $73,000? A favor?
Everything he had.

585
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:14,899
Did Lester ask you
to come up here?

586
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,233
Mr. Shaw,

587
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,934
a few hours ago, Lester stepped
in front of a subway train.

588
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:21,103
Oh, Jesus.

589
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,945
Here we go.
What are you doing?

590
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:29,544
Josh, you need to listen to me.
The FBI is lying to you.

591
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:30,642
Josh, put down the club.

592
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,447
Christ's sake, don't do
anything you can't undo.

593
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,050
Investing money is a gamble.
It doesn't always pay off.

594
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,060
Mr. Shaw, do you care?

595
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,461
Josh, come on.
No, really.

596
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,897
Do you feel any responsibility
for what happened to Lester?

597
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,190
Of course I feel badly.

598
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,827
I had no idea he was going
to lose everything.

599
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,270
Lester has been a part of
my life for over a decade.

600
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:55,201
Then why haven't you asked me
whether he's alive or dead?

601
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,078
Josh, this car
is irreplaceable!

602
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,776
Not like doormen!

603
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,312
They make new ones
of those all the time.

604
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,788
Must be 50 new doormen coming off
the line in Michigan right now!

605
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:09,687
God damn it! Stop it!

606
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,557
Want some Brie with your burger?
Here you go.

607
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,120
Josh, don't!
Shh!

608
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,959
Want me to come
work for you, huh?

609
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,430
Want to steal me away
to Saint Bart's?

610
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,032
Come on, let's go!
I'm ready to rock!

611
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,359
Mr. Kovaks, let me have
a swing at that shit!

612
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,963
No! Nobody touches
this car but me.

613
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,305
You think Steve McQueen is the
coolest cat that ever lived?

614
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,478
Guess what? Today, Steve
McQueen is my little bitch.

615
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,542
Ooh!

616
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,342
Ah!

617
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:38,977
Oh!

618
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,422
Whoops.

619
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:48,193
Don't worry, I'll have the
help come clean that up.

620
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,358
Let's go.

621
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,529
Josh, aren't you
forgetting something?

622
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,196
My breakfast order.

623
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,910
Do you understand
the shit-storm

624
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,241
that can be brought
down on this building?

625
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,181
Shaw's lawyer will shove harassment,
destruction of property

626
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,616
and civil rights charges
right down our throats!

627
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,176
Now, I don't care what Shaw did

628
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:12,983
or how much money
he's accused of stealing.

629
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:15,388
And you know damn well I got
murdered by that son of a bitch!

630
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,790
But a line has been crossed,
and a gang of vigilantes

631
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,522
will not be tolerated
at The Tower.

632
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:20,688
You're all fired.

633
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,360
Hey, wait, hold on.
Mr. Simon, they had nothing to do with this.

634
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:24,559
They just followed me up there.

635
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:25,623
I don't give a shit!

636
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,567
Mr. Simon, wait a minute, my
wife is eight months pregnant.

637
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,798
You should have thought of that
before you walked in that apartment.

638
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,033
We went up there for Lester!

639
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,870
Lester's job is waiting
for him when he gets out.

640
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:36,003
Meanwhile, the rest of you, I want
you out of the building right now.

641
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,891
Um, the carpet cleaners are coming
tomorrow, they start on 44. Okay?

642
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:01,403
Bye, Joshie.

643
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,997
Good luck with the bar.

644
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,736
I don't know what
you're talking about.

645
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:15,546
All right. Let's go, everyone.
Back to work, okay?

646
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,620
Hey, Charlie, wait!

647
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,354
Wait. I'll call Sasha,
all right.

648
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,451
I'll tell her you
tried to stop me.

649
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,690
Please, don't do me any favors.

650
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,198
And, Josh,
don't pretend to care now,

651
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,893
I know you always
wanted to fire me.

652
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,363
That's because you
stink at this job.

653
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,004
So I stink? I stink?
Yeah.

654
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,507
The guy who made Mrs. Jin
smile on Chinese New Year?

655
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,467
Mrs. Jin is Korean.

656
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,901
She's what?

657
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,037
That's why she was smiling.

658
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,638
She's not Chinese,
she's Korean.

659
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,447
And you believed her?

660
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,246
Yeah, she's Korean.

661
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,481
All right, Josh,
maybe she's Korean.

662
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,323
Why are you whispering?
She is Korean.

663
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,825
What's important is that she
appreciated the gesture I made,

664
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,918
and that's more than I
can say for some people.

665
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,831
Thanks for getting me fired.

666
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,048
Hey.

667
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,525
Hey. Thank you
for coming down.

668
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:34,188
Yeah, no problem.
You got something for me?

669
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,461
Yeah. I probably shouldn't
even be doing this,

670
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,195
because it violates
everything I believe in,

671
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,601
but I have to get my
employees' money back, so...

672
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,299
This is Shaw's travel schedule
for the last 10 years.

673
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,899
It's his guest registry.
Names of judges, politicians,

674
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,911
women,
tail number of his plane,

675
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,708
hull identification
number of his yacht,

676
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:52,543
names of his race horses
in West Virginia...

677
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:53,877
Gill's Pride and Sunny Day.

678
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,274
Yeah, we have all that, Kovaks.

679
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,548
And eventually they're gonna
sell his planes and his yachts,

680
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,523
and his horses, and the bank
is going to take it all.

681
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,184
You guys were his
smallest account.

682
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:06,927
I'm sorry.

683
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,588
It's okay.

684
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,097
Thought I'd give it a shot.

685
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,866
Kovaks,

686
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,537
you wanna get drunk?

687
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,935
Thanks.

688
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,482
I've got to be
honest with you, Kovaks.

689
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:30,280
The last time I drank this much at
a bar I made out with a fireman.

690
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,514
Really?
How long ago was that?

691
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,251
Tuesday.

692
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,619
You know, you surprise me.

693
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:42,127
I saw the security tape of you
beating the shit out of Shaw's car.

694
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,688
That was badass.

695
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,464
Yeah, well,
badass is my middle name.

696
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,835
Nope. Your middle
name is Marvin.

697
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:52,374
I know that from
your file. Marvin.

698
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,436
All right.

699
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,471
That's my dead grandfather
you're laughing at.

700
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:00,275
What else is in my file?

701
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:01,706
Oh.

702
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,413
I know the year your
parents got divorced.

703
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,352
Your SAT scores.

704
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,048
You don't know my SAT scores.

705
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,921
540, math.
480, verbal.

706
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,292
I retook those.
Your scores went down

707
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,395
I have to tell you something,

708
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,903
and I really shouldn't
be telling you this,

709
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,872
because it violates
everything I believe in.

710
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,408
Mmm-hmm.

711
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,967
We still haven't
found Shaw's safety net.

712
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:33,778
All these guys, they keep some cash
close by in case they have to run.

713
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,409
Shaw clears out all of his
accounts three months ago,

714
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,511
20 million and change.

715
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,749
But when we bust him,
the money isn't on him.

716
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,117
Wait.

717
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,223
$20 million?

718
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:47,429
There's a chance we'll
get lucky and find it.

719
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:51,634
And if we get lucky,
maybe you can get lucky.

720
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,170
I'm not lucky.

721
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,400
You just have to be patient.

722
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,870
I don't really have
time to be patient.

723
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,913
Well, if you're
tired of waiting around,

724
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,141
you can always try
the old-school approach.

725
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,339
What's that?

726
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:12,282
Grab some pitchforks and a couple
of guys and storm the castle.

727
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,482
They'd never see you coming.

728
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,615
I have to pee.

729
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,719
Ooh! I'm gonna...
I have to go.

730
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,127
Whoa, whoa.
You can't drive.

731
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,459
I'm gonna get a crab.

732
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,521
Crab?

733
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:27,092
Listen, you violated
three federal laws

734
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,796
when you beat up
Shaw's Ferrari.

735
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,829
So what?

736
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,842
So a lot of guys down at the
bureau want to buy you a drink,

737
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,377
and so do I.

738
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:41,642
Bye.

739
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,446
Goodbye.

740
00:35:58,623 --> 00:35:59,966
Manuel.

741
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,597
Sorry, Mr. K, I can't let
you into the building.

742
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,869
No, no, I just have to grab some
stuff out of my office, okay?

743
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,035
I promise
I won't attack anyone.

744
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,100
I can't do it.

745
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:14,442
Or should I tell Mr. Simon about
you and the cougar in 2813?

746
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,317
Two minutes.
Okay.

747
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,762
Hi, welcome to Shake Shack.
What can I get you?

748
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,196
Hey, Mr. Kovaks.

749
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:06,201
Welcome to Shake Shack.
What's shaking? We shake all day.

750
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,695
You like working here?

751
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,166
I cry at night.

752
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,999
You said you know
electrical engineering?

753
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,242
I'm on the
phone with the police.

754
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,781
They have a cruiser
in the area. Go away!

755
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:23,216
It's me, Mr. Fitzhugh.
Can you open the door, please?

756
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,287
Hey-
Hey...

757
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,450
Why are you
staying in this motel?

758
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,495
I'm thinking of becoming
a male prostitute.

759
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,422
I think I might
have a better idea.

760
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,107
Sasha told me you took a job.

761
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,914
Oh, yeah. I'm using all the skills
you taught me as a concierge.

762
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,251
Thank you very much.
Hey, no spitting, blue shirt.

763
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,355
Suck it,
douche bag!

764
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,756
It's not a bad job.
Only problem is

765
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:05,794
I need 40 hours to
get on the insurance,

766
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,057
it's hard to get shifts, but if
I don't get on the insurance,

767
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,427
it's probably gonna
end up costing us

768
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,489
around $20,000
to have the baby.

769
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:14,092
So we'll probably
have to sell it.

770
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,096
I need your help.

771
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:21,065
So you're saying you wanna rob
$20 million from Arthur Shaw.

772
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,271
Which you think he's hidden
in a secret wall safe

773
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,904
inside his penthouse apartment.

774
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,539
An apartment which he's
not allowed to leave

775
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,948
and is guarded by three FBI
agents, 24 hours a day.

776
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,041
Two.

777
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:31,279
And you wanna do all
of this in a building

778
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,616
with the most advanced security

779
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,054
and surveillance
system in the world.

780
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,648
A building which we've all been
barred from ever entering again?

781
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,593
Yes. How do you
guys feel about that?

782
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,528
Well, I've really
enjoyed myself.

783
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:43,792
Thanks for the crackers.

784
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,925
Mr. Fitzhugh, I know the
money is in that safe.

785
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,697
How do you know?

786
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,295
Because in 2003,
Shaw remodeled.

787
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,672
He spent like 10 million to blow out
the kitchen, move the living room.

788
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,210
He even brought in
some guy from China

789
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:56,609
to do a whole feng shui thing.

790
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,839
But he left one wall standing,

791
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,404
dead center in the
middle of the apartment.

792
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,778
That's where he put the safe.

793
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,078
Maybe it's
a load-bearing wall.

794
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,812
No. No, it isn't.

795
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,114
We have the same
wall in my place.

796
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,883
We took it down
when we first moved in.

797
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,049
The FBI can't find the money,
because he hid it in the wall.

798
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,285
I know it!

799
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,130
So you guys in or out?

800
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,421
Mr. Fitzhugh?

801
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:20,262
Come back to me.

802
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,034
Mr. Dev'Reaux?

803
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,836
You know how many weeks I'd have to
work at the BK to make 20 million?

804
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:28,174
18,600

805
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,273
Charlie, come on.

806
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,715
Look at us.
We're basically waiters.

807
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,780
That's what we do. We bring people stuff.
We don't take things.

808
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,447
You and I know the
movements of every person.

809
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,115
We know the schedules,
deliveries and codes

810
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,214
for every door and window.

811
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,760
We've been casing the place for over
a decade, we just didn't know it.

812
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,386
We didn't know it, because
we weren't doing it.

813
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,953
But we were.
No.

814
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,794
Okay, where do the Lippmans
keep their passports?

815
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:52,725
In the freezer.
Mmm-hmm.

816
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,827
How many in vitro fertilizations
did Miss Hansen have

817
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,565
before she gave birth to Jonah?

818
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,129
Six.
See? We know everything!

819
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,004
What's the pass code
for Mr. Shaw's elevator?

820
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,038
I just press the PH button.

821
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,447
Come on, man.
I need you.

822
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,609
Yeah, you need me, because
you've got these idiots.

823
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:09,878
You think we're
getting our money back?

824
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,681
You think Lester is
getting his money?

825
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,415
I talked to the FBI It's gone!

826
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,883
So all this is about getting
it back for Lester?

827
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:19,951
Yes! And Rose and Miss lovenko
and Manuel and you, you jerk!

828
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,221
Come on! Let's storm
the castle together.

829
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,233
Oh, like when they went
after Frankenstein?

830
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,700
No, it's a different
kind of storming.

831
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,703
It's a storming where the
peasants take everything back.

832
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,170
From like
the feudal lords and...

833
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,433
I'm in.

834
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:33,603
Holy shit! I'm in.

835
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,072
Holy shit! I'm in.

836
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,548
Well, now we're
undefeatable, aren't we?

837
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,846
Josh, we're not criminals.
We don't know how to steal.

838
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,184
It's okay,
I know someone who does.

839
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,481
Crack four!

840
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,866
You must have been saying
your prayers, Slide.

841
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,057
You made bail.

842
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,966
Slide.

843
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,639
Thought you might need a ride.

844
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,414
I haven't driven
my Nova for a few months.

845
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,195
Did you know that in Spanish
No va means "It doesn't go"?

846
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,993
That's why they didn't
sell many in Latin America

847
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:35,030
I didn't realize Rikers
was on an actual island.

848
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:38,005
I thought it was more of a...
I don't know, like a...

849
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,872
You know, like the way Puget
Sound is actually an inlet.

850
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,342
But they...

851
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,804
You hungry?
Can I buy you some lunch?

852
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:48,675
Slide, what are you doing?

853
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:49,774
Tell me why you bailed me out!

854
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,043
Take your foot off the gas!

855
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,452
Answer the goddamn
question first!

856
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,615
Slide!

857
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:58,283
Red light!

858
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:06,459
All right, what's going on?

859
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,594
You wearing
a wire or something?

860
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:08,796
Some kind of police
undercover shit?

861
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,167
No, I'm not a cop!

862
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,138
Then you brought me out here for
some kind of freak shit, huh?

863
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,198
You want to stimulate my nut sack.
Is that what it is, punk?

864
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,608
No! Jesus!

865
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,010
Then what the hell we doing out here, man?
I don't even know your name.

866
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,014
I'm Josh Kovaks.

867
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,380
Man in the suit.
We talk almost every morning.

868
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:23,984
How come you
bailed me out, man?

869
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:27,612
I need help with something, and I
thought given our relationship

870
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:28,816
you might be willing to help.

871
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,756
Relationship? I ain't got no
relationship with your ass!

872
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:31,815
Our history!

873
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,384
What history? I see you walking
by every now and then.

874
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:34,656
I say, "Hey, what's up,
little biatch?"

875
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,061
Just another
passer-by going by.

876
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,155
Just another nigger walking by.

877
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,394
You don't remember 1971?
Mrs. Saltzburg?

878
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,170
We used to get dropped off at her
apartment every morning for day care.

879
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,638
In 1971 I'm six!
How am I supposed to remember some shit?

880
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,641
Come on, Darnell
Mrs. Saltzburg!

881
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,699
Heavy-set German woman,
short goatee.

882
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,837
Man, you call me Darnell one more
time, I will beat you to death.

883
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,778
<i>You don't remember
Inch High, Private Eye?</i>

884
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,474
<i>Davey and Goliath?
Remember Witchiepoo?</i>

885
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,313
<i>H.R. Pufnstuf.
You got freaked out by her?</i>

886
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:57,408
Remember that kid came over

887
00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:00,011
and he stole my inhaler
and I couldn't breathe?

888
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,720
I do remember you!

889
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,090
You the little seizure boy that was
having them seizures all the time!

890
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,253
No, I never had any seizures!

891
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,694
They were minor
spasms of the throat.

892
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,389
And I remember you would start
foaming up at the mouth

893
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,228
and your eyes would go crooked.
It was very scary!

894
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:12,528
There was no foaming.
That was you!

895
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,365
A lot of people have
asthma when they're kids.

896
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,302
It's not a big deal.
I outgrew it. No. Seizure Boy.

897
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,499
You'd be on the floor rolling all around.
You was having seizures!

898
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:21,065
Asthma doesn't cause
seizures, all right?

899
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,008
Oh, really? Then how come nobody
wanted to play with your ass?

900
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,102
Nobody wanted to
have naptime with you,

901
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,442
nobody wanted to do coloring
with you or nothing.

902
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:26,503
Because of your little seizures

903
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,049
and didn't nobody
want to catch that shit!

904
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,550
I'm gonna ask you
one more time, punk.

905
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,052
Why did you bail me out?

906
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:34,021
Because I have a job and I thought
that given your skill set

907
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,455
maybe you could help us out.

908
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,082
What kind of skill set is that?

909
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:41,059
Taking things that don't
necessarily belong to you.

910
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:48,269
Oh, little Seizure Boy want
to try to rob somebody, huh?

911
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,868
What you trying to steal?

912
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:53,470
$20 million.

913
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,245
Let's go get something to eat.

914
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:08,346
Hey, guys,
this is my friend Slide.

915
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,825
You kidding, right?

916
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:13,327
These ain't the guys you wanna
try to do this job with.

917
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:16,456
Yes, this is Charlie and
Dev'Reaux and Mr. Fitzhugh.

918
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,692
This is a joke, right?

919
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:18,927
This guy is
the big time criminal?

920
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,024
Hey, what you say?

921
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,468
All right, guys, take it easy.
He's totally qualified.

922
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,028
He's been arrested
a bunch of times,

923
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:26,096
he pays no income taxes, he's
got two Doberman pinschers.

924
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,301
So let's show him some respect.

925
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,469
<i>So now we're like
The Doberman Gang?</i>

926
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:30,568
Like the what?

927
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,543
It was a movie. They trained
Dobermans to knock off a bank.

928
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:36,084
Is that the one where Gregory
Peck was attacked by those dogs?

929
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,552
<i>No, that's Boys from Brazil
with the cloned Hitlers.</i>

930
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,589
<i>Oh, shit. You guys ever
seen Boys Don't Cry?</i>

931
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,749
When Hilary Swank
plays that dude.

932
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,121
That scared the shit out of me.

933
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,960
Wait, Slide. Sit down and
talk with us for a second.

934
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,655
These guys ain't
got what it take.

935
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:49,891
I can look in
their eyes and see it.

936
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:52,091
First sign of trouble, they're
gonna be shitting in their pants.

937
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,601
They will not.
You don't know them.

938
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,093
You want me to prove it?

939
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,201
All right, listen up,

940
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,832
y'all got 15 minutes to go out
there and steal me something.

941
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:00,967
What do you mean?

942
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,170
You heard what I said.
In this mall, right now, each one of y'all

943
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:05,679
go out there and individually
steal $50 worth of merchandise,

944
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,410
come back and put it on the table.
Then we'll talk.

945
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,620
Okay, 50 bucks,
no problem. Come on.

946
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:13,814
Can I go with you, Josh?

947
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,481
No, you ain't going with
Josh, you go by yourself.

948
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,581
Everybody going by their self.

949
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:17,717
Anybody can't
handle this, is out.

950
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:18,987
Okay. Guys,
we can do this.

951
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,722
It's just shoplifting.
You got 15 minutes, let's go.

952
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:22,764
And put your wallets on the table.
I don't want nobody cheating

953
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,232
I don't want y'all to go buy
the shit and say you stole it.

954
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,462
All right, come on, let's go.

955
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:38,510
This is a part of our Sexy
Little Things collection.

956
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:42,915
Oh, yeah, that's great.
Love that. Yeah.

957
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,451
Would you like me to
ring that up for you?

958
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:49,221
No, I think I'll just
live with it a little first.

959
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,731
These are very
pretty Bella earrings.

960
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,707
They're from our
Timeless Collection.

961
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:09,902
Do you have any studs?

962
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,640
Yes, several.

963
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,079
Right here.

964
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,350
Do you have any hoops?

965
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:18,854
Sir, all of our earrings
are on this display.

966
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:22,516
Do you have a catalog?

967
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:23,580
Uh...

968
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,524
I might have one in the
back, let me check.

969
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,297
How do those feel?

970
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,500
They feel a little tight.
Do you have them in a half size up?

971
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:41,702
Yeah, let me check the back.

972
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:40,095
Hey, them two pairs of
drawers don't cost no $50.

973
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,233
$12 scented candle.

974
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:48,437
Okay, we'll get
to work tomorrow.

975
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:50,205
Wait a minute.
We all just proved ourselves.

976
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,769
How do we know you can
really pull this off?

977
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,111
You each stole
$50 worth of shit,

978
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:56,151
I stole $264 in cash.

979
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,812
Rule number one, never give
your wallet to a thief.

980
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:00,879
Later, bitches.

981
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,292
What are we doing up here, man?
My balls are snow cones.

982
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:09,490
Can I get my jacket?

983
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,396
Everybody
shut up, right now.

984
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:17,996
In a robbery,
things can change quickly.

985
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,970
It can go from hot to
cold, just like that.

986
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:24,035
You have to be ready to
adapt to the situation.

987
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,274
You have to be able
to think on your feet.

988
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:29,180
I was on a job a few days ago where
my homie got shot in the face.

989
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,510
He's kidding, right?

990
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:31,881
Get shot in the head,
it's over.

991
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:34,218
If you get shot in your head, it's over.
If you get shot in your face,

992
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,383
the bullet will go in your cheek,
then come out the other side.

993
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,823
Then what you gonna do, sissy?

994
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,622
Die. I'm gonna die.

995
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,653
I saw a television show once

996
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:44,198
about a guy who got shot in
the head with a nail gun.

997
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,892
He couldn't even remember
how to chew any more.

998
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:47,401
He had to put
everything in a blender.

999
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,093
Yo, he couldn't
figure out how to chew,

1000
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,536
but he could
operate a Cuisinart?

1001
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,005
I don't think he
operated it himself.

1002
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,008
All right, could we just focus, please?
It's 16 degrees!

1003
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:55,543
That's right!
Let's focus!

1004
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,976
Now, earlier today
I taught you all

1005
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:58,638
how to pick a lock
with a bobby pin.

1006
00:48:58,702 --> 00:48:59,840
I want y'all to
practice on this door.

1007
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,406
I've got bobby pins for all of y'all.
Here's your bobby pin.

1008
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,008
This is your bobby pin.

1009
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,917
Here's your bobby pin.

1010
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:08,820
This is your punk-ass
bobby pin. Take it!

1011
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:12,385
You unlock the door,
you won't freeze to death

1012
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:16,559
I'm gonna be inside
having sex with Rita.

1013
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,533
Who's Rita?

1014
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,595
To get in the building, we
have to avoid seven exterior cameras

1015
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,107
and six doormen who work at two
entrance points in rotating shifts.

1016
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,576
Once inside, we'll be faced
with four security officers,

1017
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,079
who monitor a bank of
12 internal cameras,

1018
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,773
as well as two
floating security guards,

1019
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:35,373
who vary
the patrol route each day.

1020
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:36,509
If we make it
through all of that,

1021
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:37,711
we still have to get
through this gauntlet

1022
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:39,412
of employees to
get to the elevators.

1023
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,477
Questions?

1024
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,490
Yeah. Who's that
girl in the red dress?

1025
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,150
She got the kind of titties
I like to play with.

1026
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:46,387
That's Mary-Ann from sales.
She's a lesbian.

1027
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:47,720
Okay, that's irrelevant.

1028
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:48,990
Mary-Ann
is a lesbian?

1029
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:50,895
She was married when
she sold me my unit.

1030
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:53,059
She makes lesbian sex with Lynn
Rutherford from accounting.

1031
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:55,330
Okay...
Lynn is a lesbian?

1032
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:56,564
Wait, I'm lost.

1033
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,867
How many lesbians total
do we have to avoid?

1034
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,499
None. We're not
avoiding lesbians.

1035
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:03,909
I don't avoid lesbians at all.
I seek lesbians out.

1036
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,646
Lesbians got
the nicest titties.

1037
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:07,412
Straight women, they have guys

1038
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:09,747
pulling and yanking on them
and sweating on them.

1039
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:12,252
Lesbians get touched
delicately by other lesbians.

1040
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,617
It's nice.

1041
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,247
Did anybody take in
what I just said?

1042
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:17,155
Well, it seems like there's
a gauntlet of lesbians.

1043
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:18,557
No. The...

1044
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,326
All right,
I'm just gonna keep going.

1045
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:28,994
1:27, NYPD makes third
pass in front of the building.

1046
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,333
The parking enforcement officer

1047
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,135
only works the west
side of the street.

1048
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,799
She got a fat ass, too.

1049
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,241
All right, baby, I'll
call you after lunch.

1050
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:36,572
I'm in a restaurant with Josh

1051
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,909
and a couple of other guys
across from The Tower.

1052
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:40,909
Yeah. I love you.

1053
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:46,044
What are you doing?
It's supposed to be a secret.

1054
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:49,048
I can't tell my wife
I'm having a lunch?

1055
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:51,786
We're not having lunch.
We're casing the front of the building.

1056
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,350
Now they can trace
our steps back to us

1057
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:54,987
I didn't tell her what
restaurant we were at.

1058
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,725
You said, "The restaurant
across from The Tower."

1059
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,789
I didn't say which restaurant
across from The Tower.

1060
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:01,961
Geez, a hamburger's $24.
We can't afford to eat here anyway.

1061
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:04,562
Hey, we can order
whatever we like, because.

1062
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,730
lunch is on me.

1063
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,972
This is the main
electrical room.

1064
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:15,414
You can override the elevators from
here or shut them down completely.

1065
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:17,975
Mr. Dev'Reaux, who took some courses
at DeVry Technical Institute,

1066
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:19,315
is gonna be our
point man on this.

1067
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:21,083
Online.
What?

1068
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:24,118
I went there to go get my
master's in electronics,

1069
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:26,923
but somebody said, "You got
to go to college first."

1070
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,224
I was, like, "Yeah, it
wasn't in the brochure."

1071
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:32,761
Okay,
but you understand what...

1072
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:36,862
Absolutely. I weld stuff and I'm,
like, you flip it on and off.

1073
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,201
It's all about power.

1074
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,944
Hey, man, how is this supposed to be
right if you made it out of Legos?

1075
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,877
Well, the dimensions
are completely accurate.

1076
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,249
Yeah, who's this
little nigglet? Webster?

1077
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,683
Man, you might as well use
Lincoln Logs or Tinkertoys.

1078
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,980
I got your ski caps.

1079
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,214
What?

1080
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,883
No, no, no.
Ski masks. Masks.

1081
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,051
Yeah, but the guy said that these
were the warmest ever made.

1082
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,458
With pompoms?
You serious?

1083
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,588
You're such an idiot. I need a mask.
It has to cover your face

1084
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:05,362
Josh, let's say
we get the money

1085
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:06,833
and make it outside, then what?

1086
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,433
Slide is the only one with
no connection to The Tower.

1087
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:11,336
So he's agreed to hold
the money for a week.

1088
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:13,431
Are you crazy?
You're gonna give this guy $20 million?

1089
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:14,498
He's a crook!

1090
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:16,976
What you say? Say it again.
I didn't hear shit.

1091
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:18,603
- Speak into the microphone!
- Hey! Hey!

1092
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:19,874
Why don't you
say it again, punk?

1093
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:21,438
Come on, Slide, no guns.

1094
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,275
You running things now, huh?

1095
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,785
Man in the suit got
it all figured out?

1096
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:26,548
No, man in the suit doesn't
have it all figured out,

1097
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,987
but man with the gun
needs to understand

1098
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:29,955
what man in the suit is trying
to accomplish here, all right?

1099
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:31,048
Why you talking like that?

1100
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,253
You were talking like that!
Why can't I talk like that?

1101
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,387
What you think, this is a joke, Josh?
We gonna just walk in there

1102
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,295
and roll this dude for$20
million without a fight?

1103
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:40,193
Look, no guns.
End of story, all right?

1104
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:41,930
What if we run into some shit
in there we don't expect?

1105
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,528
Trust me, there won't
be any surprises.

1106
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,404
It's the
FBI lady and two cops.

1107
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,415
Shit! We haven't
done anything yet.

1108
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:56,712
We're plotters. We've plotted.
That's a crime, right?

1109
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:57,808
Is that a crime?

1110
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:58,909
Everybody, just relax.

1111
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:00,352
You relax!
I'm out on bail.

1112
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,189
I'm gonna go in the closet.
I'm coming with you.

1113
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:03,986
Guys, it's okay, I
think she's here for me.

1114
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,151
Go find
your own spot.

1115
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:12,425
Hey, Agent Denham, what a surprise.
What's with the police?

1116
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,469
Josh, Arthur Shaw
is gonna walk.

1117
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:16,427
What?

1118
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,769
The judge is gonna dismiss the
case next week at his hearing.

1119
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,171
They're acting
like he's untouchable.

1120
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,772
That's it? He just
gets away with it?

1121
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:23,833
That's not it.

1122
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,073
He's threatening to press
charges against you.

1123
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,116
He wants you to
answer for the Ferrari.

1124
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:29,479
So they're here to arrest me?

1125
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,145
He says he'll drop the whole
thing if you apologize.

1126
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,449
A sincere apology,

1127
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,590
that's what Shaw wants.

1128
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:36,783
And if I don't do it?

1129
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:39,593
Then these gentlemen
will read you your rights.

1130
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:02,108
You know what's considered the greatest
move in the history of chess, Josh?

1131
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:03,947
A man named
Frank James Marshall

1132
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,578
was losing to a man
named Levitsky in 1912,

1133
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,589
world championship in Helsinki.

1134
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:13,958
And it looked like Marshall had no
chance until he moved 23 queen G-3.

1135
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:16,463
He deliberately
sacrificed his queen

1136
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,658
and the move was so
shocking and surprising

1137
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:20,827
that Levitsky
never got over it.

1138
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,427
He lost the game
two moves later.

1139
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:28,067
And the move became known in the annals
of chess as the "Marshall swindle."

1140
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:34,471
I'm a very good chess player,
but I'm no swindler.

1141
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:39,019
What you did to my Ferrari
was the move of a small man.

1142
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:42,989
But now it's my move, and I'm not
sure how I want to play this.

1143
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,061
All I'd like
to say, Mr. Shaw,

1144
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,290
is someday I'm gonna find
away to make things right.

1145
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:51,159
I don't care what I have to do,

1146
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,529
I will find
a way to pay you back

1147
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:53,932
for everything
that has been done.

1148
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:58,103
Good, because I know how
difficult it must be for you

1149
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:00,641
to lose a service job
like this at your age.

1150
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:05,145
And one day when all this is ancient
history, I hope you can come back,

1151
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:06,976
maybe not as a building
manager at first,

1152
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,916
but somewhere where you can
start over, earn our trust.

1153
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,384
A doorman, for instance.

1154
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,389
Now go home and practice
your chess game.

1155
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,760
I'll study the "Marshall
swindle," sir.

1156
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:22,958
Anybody can sacrifice
their queen, Josh.

1157
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,530
The real trick is
getting away with it.

1158
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:34,670
Thanks for the ride.

1159
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,574
Anytime.
Oh, God, wait a minute,

1160
00:55:36,955 --> 00:55:39,265
Before you go, this is for you.

1161
00:55:40,659 --> 00:55:41,694
It's a present.

1162
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,036
It's the footage of you beating
the shit out of Shaw's car.

1163
00:55:44,095 --> 00:55:46,575
I took it from the security
camera in his apartment.

1164
00:55:47,832 --> 00:55:49,436
You committed larceny for me?

1165
00:55:49,901 --> 00:55:52,507
Let's just say, I misplaced
three minutes of footage.

1166
00:55:54,205 --> 00:55:55,650
Thank you.
I'm touched.

1167
00:55:56,141 --> 00:55:58,018
You're welcome.
Okay.

1168
00:56:06,685 --> 00:56:08,130
Are you working
on Saturday night?

1169
00:56:08,186 --> 00:56:09,722
I'm always working.

1170
00:56:09,788 --> 00:56:11,028
Call in sick.

1171
00:56:12,223 --> 00:56:14,965
You're asking
an FBI agent to lie?

1172
00:56:15,727 --> 00:56:17,638
I'm asking an FBI
agent to dinner.

1173
00:56:20,331 --> 00:56:21,503
I'll see you Saturday night.

1174
00:56:21,566 --> 00:56:22,840
Good.

1175
00:56:29,174 --> 00:56:30,482
What the hell is that
in your hand?

1176
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,118
It's a present.

1177
00:56:33,178 --> 00:56:34,282
She gave you a present?

1178
00:56:34,579 --> 00:56:35,683
I don't know
about the other guys,

1179
00:56:35,747 --> 00:56:37,920
but I don't want you seeing
the federal agent any more.

1180
00:56:37,982 --> 00:56:39,393
I'm not seeing her
until Saturday night.

1181
00:56:39,451 --> 00:56:40,862
Oh, my God!
He's dating her.

1182
00:56:40,919 --> 00:56:43,798
Relax, my social life and my
criminal life are totally separate.

1183
00:56:43,855 --> 00:56:45,129
They're not separate
if you're dating

1184
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:47,170
the FBI agent who
busted Arthur Shaw!

1185
00:56:47,225 --> 00:56:49,171
Shouldn't we be
avoiding law enforcement?

1186
00:56:49,227 --> 00:56:51,002
I never saw
an episode of Matlock

1187
00:56:51,062 --> 00:56:52,803
where the criminal
banged Matlock!

1188
00:56:53,064 --> 00:56:55,101
Well, it don't matter.
Is this the safe?

1189
00:56:55,767 --> 00:56:56,768
Yeah.

1190
00:56:56,835 --> 00:56:58,815
Then we have a really
serious problem.

1191
00:57:03,007 --> 00:57:04,213
You saying you can't open it?

1192
00:57:04,275 --> 00:57:06,380
No, I'm saying I never worked
on a safe like this before

1193
00:57:06,444 --> 00:57:07,718
I usually break
into strongboxes.

1194
00:57:07,779 --> 00:57:09,690
You never said it was a real
safe made out of steel.

1195
00:57:09,781 --> 00:57:11,260
We're going after $20 million.

1196
00:57:11,316 --> 00:57:12,351
What did you think
it would be? Wood?

1197
00:57:12,417 --> 00:57:14,328
What kind of thief
can't open a safe?

1198
00:57:14,385 --> 00:57:16,023
Well, generally
I rob balconies.

1199
00:57:16,087 --> 00:57:17,964
Balconies?
Like a cat burglar?

1200
00:57:18,022 --> 00:57:19,831
That way I never get charged
with breaking and entering.

1201
00:57:19,891 --> 00:57:21,495
And I never steal
nothing over $1,000,

1202
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:23,539
because in New York
that shit is a felony.

1203
00:57:23,762 --> 00:57:25,435
What do you get?
Like potted plants?

1204
00:57:25,497 --> 00:57:27,602
No, bitch! I don't be
stealing no potted plants!

1205
00:57:27,665 --> 00:57:29,474
I steal mostly
satellite dishes.

1206
00:57:29,534 --> 00:57:31,741
I got a friend of mine who be
hooking up illegal DirecTV.

1207
00:57:31,803 --> 00:57:33,680
Hey, can your friend
hook me up?

1208
00:57:33,738 --> 00:57:35,274
No!
This is a bunch of horseshit.

1209
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,683
Your thief isn't even a thief.

1210
00:57:36,741 --> 00:57:38,846
Hang on a sec.
You can figure this out, right?

1211
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:40,583
No, I can't figure this out.

1212
00:57:40,645 --> 00:57:42,784
I'm serious. You have to
find a actual safe-cracker.

1213
00:57:42,847 --> 00:57:44,155
Where am I gonna
find a safe-cracker?

1214
00:57:44,215 --> 00:57:46,252
I don't know. You have to start
thinking outside the box.

1215
00:57:46,317 --> 00:57:50,265
Shit, you got to find somebody with
some safe-cracking history. Think!

1216
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:54,869
So, Odessa, I think we should
address the elephant in the room.

1217
00:57:55,326 --> 00:57:57,328
What the hell you just call me?

1218
00:57:57,395 --> 00:57:59,966
No, no. I'm talking about
the anger you have for me.

1219
00:58:00,031 --> 00:58:01,374
How you blame me for
losing the pension,

1220
00:58:01,432 --> 00:58:03,343
which is the last thing
I ever wanted to happen

1221
00:58:04,335 --> 00:58:06,178
I know you're
a good man, Mr. K,

1222
00:58:06,237 --> 00:58:07,773
even though you ruined my life.

1223
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:09,512
Which is why
I invited you here.

1224
00:58:09,808 --> 00:58:11,378
When I hired you,
I made a note that

1225
00:58:11,442 --> 00:58:12,978
you worked for your
father in Kingston.

1226
00:58:13,044 --> 00:58:14,250
He was a locksmith.

1227
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:16,024
Yes, the best in Jamaica.

1228
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,081
Uh-huh.

1229
00:58:17,148 --> 00:58:19,219
Did he teach you
how to open locks

1230
00:58:19,284 --> 00:58:20,922
and doors and things like that?

1231
00:58:20,985 --> 00:58:23,329
There ain't no lock
I can't get by, Mr. K.

1232
00:58:24,189 --> 00:58:28,831
I was just wondering, do you
think you could open this thing?

1233
00:58:28,893 --> 00:58:32,363
That safe has a six-number wheel
pack with a double-action fence.

1234
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:34,410
Very tricky spindle.

1235
00:58:34,465 --> 00:58:36,308
Probably take me
15 minutes to open.

1236
00:58:36,801 --> 00:58:39,805
Fifteen minutes?
Could you show us?

1237
00:58:41,139 --> 00:58:42,914
What's in it for me?

1238
00:58:45,844 --> 00:58:47,846
2:42,
Lester at his post.

1239
00:58:50,415 --> 00:58:53,453
Couple of NYPD officers
at the falafel cart.

1240
00:58:56,654 --> 00:58:58,156
Wait a second.

1241
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:00,126
That's Charlie.

1242
00:59:02,327 --> 00:59:03,806
What's Charlie doing here?

1243
00:59:04,195 --> 00:59:07,074
Yeah, why is Charlie
going into The Tower?

1244
00:59:14,305 --> 00:59:15,909
What did you do?

1245
00:59:16,207 --> 00:59:20,212
I went to talk to Mr. Simon He
called me, said he had a job for me.

1246
00:59:20,278 --> 00:59:23,122
He wants me to be
the building manager.

1247
00:59:23,781 --> 00:59:25,488
He asked you to be
the building manager?

1248
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:28,554
Yeah, he offered me
your job, so I took it.

1249
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:31,123
That's ridiculous!
You're not qualified.

1250
00:59:31,189 --> 00:59:34,636
But it's not ridiculous
for you to rob $20 million?

1251
00:59:34,692 --> 00:59:36,763
I can't believe how
irresponsible you're being!

1252
00:59:36,828 --> 00:59:38,865
You really think that you're
gonna just stroll in there

1253
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:40,910
like Robin Hood and his
band of merry doormen

1254
00:59:40,965 --> 00:59:43,138
and outsmart the guys
with ear pieces and guns?

1255
00:59:43,201 --> 00:59:45,203
Why is that so hard
for you to believe, huh?

1256
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:47,216
Why can't you just be
my skinny Friar Tuck?

1257
00:59:47,472 --> 00:59:49,145
Come on!
Who's Friar Tuck?

1258
00:59:49,207 --> 00:59:51,448
Friar Tuck is the guy
who helps Robin Hood!

1259
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:53,646
I can't do this, Josh.

1260
00:59:53,711 --> 00:59:56,988
You put one foot inside The Tower,
I'm gonna call in a Code Blue.

1261
00:59:57,048 --> 00:59:58,550
It's black.
It's Code Black!

1262
00:59:58,683 --> 01:00:00,287
You call it black,
I call it blue.

1263
01:00:00,351 --> 01:00:04,026
Maybe I made up new codes, because
I'm in charge of The Tower now.

1264
01:00:04,088 --> 01:00:07,558
I'm warning you, Josh, come
near, it's a Code Blue-Black.

1265
01:00:12,964 --> 01:00:15,877
First thing you do, you
have to find the entry point.

1266
01:00:16,167 --> 01:00:19,307
You have to use your fingers
when you find the entry point.

1267
01:00:21,339 --> 01:00:23,216
It's all in the touch.

1268
01:00:24,776 --> 01:00:25,914
You married?

1269
01:00:26,811 --> 01:00:28,813
Say what?
You married?

1270
01:00:30,915 --> 01:00:32,724
No, I ain't married.

1271
01:00:33,718 --> 01:00:35,061
What's up?

1272
01:00:35,853 --> 01:00:37,491
Just taking a poll.

1273
01:00:37,555 --> 01:00:38,693
Taking a poll?

1274
01:00:38,756 --> 01:00:40,531
I'll take your poll

1275
01:00:44,896 --> 01:00:46,637
Why did you call me here?

1276
01:00:46,698 --> 01:00:48,109
I got a call two hours ago

1277
01:00:48,166 --> 01:00:49,839
from Judge Hollingsworth's
clerk.

1278
01:00:49,901 --> 01:00:52,279
They're moving Arthur's court
date up to Thanksgiving.

1279
01:00:52,337 --> 01:00:53,372
Thanksgiving?

1280
01:00:53,438 --> 01:00:55,543
The judge wants to avoid
a media circus on this,

1281
01:00:55,606 --> 01:00:57,608
let him walk as
quietly as possible.

1282
01:00:58,276 --> 01:00:59,584
It's an act of contrition.

1283
01:01:00,078 --> 01:01:01,250
By the way, Agent Denham,

1284
01:01:01,312 --> 01:01:04,555
I'll be pressing charges against
Josh and all his accomplices

1285
01:01:04,615 --> 01:01:06,356
the moment I step out of court.

1286
01:01:06,417 --> 01:01:09,626
Come on, he did what you
asked, he apologized.

1287
01:01:10,021 --> 01:01:13,002
It's time everyone
paid for their mistakes

1288
01:01:14,025 --> 01:01:15,095
I agree.

1289
01:01:20,598 --> 01:01:21,599
Hello.

1290
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:23,270
There's something
that you need to know.

1291
01:01:23,334 --> 01:01:27,714
They moved Shaw's court date up to
Thursday, and he's coming for you.

1292
01:01:27,772 --> 01:01:29,183
You'll be in jail
by the weekend.

1293
01:01:29,841 --> 01:01:31,514
That really messes up
our plans, doesn't it?

1294
01:01:33,378 --> 01:01:36,120
Josh, you need to
get yourself a lawyer.

1295
01:01:36,781 --> 01:01:38,124
<i>Take care.</i>

1296
01:01:41,853 --> 01:01:43,730
Great news, it worked.

1297
01:01:44,255 --> 01:01:46,394
We're good for Thanksgiving.

1298
01:01:57,435 --> 01:01:58,846
My sister will be
taking the Q train

1299
01:01:58,903 --> 01:02:00,314
to my uncle's
house in Brighton.

1300
01:02:00,371 --> 01:02:01,748
She cooks for him every year.

1301
01:02:01,806 --> 01:02:03,376
How am I gonna know
what she looks like?

1302
01:02:03,441 --> 01:02:04,784
Here.

1303
01:02:04,842 --> 01:02:06,287
Got it.
Okay.

1304
01:02:14,919 --> 01:02:16,557
"I know some of you
believe I'm the reason.

1305
01:02:16,621 --> 01:02:20,000
"Paul McCartney didn't buy
an apartment here in 2008.

1306
01:02:20,058 --> 01:02:21,366
"Maybe I did get
a little confused

1307
01:02:21,426 --> 01:02:23,633
"about the meaning
of the word 'wanker'.

1308
01:02:23,694 --> 01:02:26,641
"Maybe you heard about
the Mrs. Jin incident.

1309
01:02:27,465 --> 01:02:29,911
"I know that I'm
not Josh Kovaks.

1310
01:02:30,868 --> 01:02:32,745
"But today I am your leader.

1311
01:02:32,804 --> 01:02:35,683
"And today is Thanksgiving, the
toughest day of the year for The Tower.

1312
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:39,017
"Forty-three parties, close
to 500 guests, 30 caterers,

1313
01:02:39,077 --> 01:02:41,523
"all of Garage 2
blocked until 4:00.

1314
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:44,583
"Today, you might say,
is our Super Bowl.

1315
01:02:44,649 --> 01:02:48,358
"Today, you might say,
we will not lose."

1316
01:02:51,422 --> 01:02:52,423
Booyah.

1317
01:03:11,976 --> 01:03:15,150
<i>The start of Macy's Thanksgiving
Day parade is just moments away.</i>

1318
01:03:15,213 --> 01:03:17,625
<i>Three million people will line
the streets of this city.</i>

1319
01:03:17,715 --> 01:03:19,661
<i>Fifty million more
will watch from homes</i>

1320
01:03:19,717 --> 01:03:22,163
<i>all across the country
and around the globe.</i>

1321
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:25,133
<i>When the parade begins,
all eyes turn to the sky</i>

1322
01:03:25,189 --> 01:03:28,466
as the largest balloons in the
world soar above this city.

1323
01:03:28,526 --> 01:03:31,530
It's a sight that brings out
the child in all of us.

1324
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:54,256
Hey, Josh,
here's your sister's phone.

1325
01:03:54,318 --> 01:03:55,319
Great.

1326
01:03:55,386 --> 01:03:56,763
She's really hot, by the way.

1327
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,237
Watch your head,
Mr. Shaw.

1328
01:04:13,538 --> 01:04:14,608
Where's Slide?

1329
01:04:14,672 --> 01:04:15,980
He's supposed to be here.

1330
01:04:23,414 --> 01:04:25,325
They're on the move.

1331
01:04:27,018 --> 01:04:28,429
Wait a sec.

1332
01:04:30,388 --> 01:04:31,958
- Oh, God.
- What?

1333
01:04:32,123 --> 01:04:33,727
What is it?
It's Slide.

1334
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,929
Is he coming up here?

1335
01:04:34,992 --> 01:04:36,869
What is he doing?

1336
01:04:36,928 --> 01:04:37,929
He's wearing my suit.

1337
01:04:38,663 --> 01:04:39,767
He stole my suit.

1338
01:04:40,932 --> 01:04:42,411
He's heading for The Tower.

1339
01:04:42,466 --> 01:04:43,911
Well, that's not the plan.

1340
01:04:43,968 --> 01:04:46,107
How do you forget a plan?
Didn't he write it down?

1341
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:47,171
He didn't forget it.

1342
01:04:47,238 --> 01:04:48,683
All that time he
spent with Odessa,

1343
01:04:48,739 --> 01:04:50,116
he thinks he can open the safe.

1344
01:04:50,174 --> 01:04:51,244
I don't understand.

1345
01:04:51,442 --> 01:04:52,682
He's going for the money.

1346
01:04:52,743 --> 01:04:54,279
Didn't I tell you
he would screw us?

1347
01:04:54,879 --> 01:04:56,085
What are we gonna do?

1348
01:04:56,714 --> 01:04:58,523
We stick to the plan.

1349
01:04:58,883 --> 01:05:00,419
We go on Snoopy.

1350
01:05:04,388 --> 01:05:07,028
Holy shit!
You guys are not gonna believe this.

1351
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:09,338
That girl that moved into 4811?

1352
01:05:09,393 --> 01:05:11,236
She's in French
Playboy this month.

1353
01:05:11,295 --> 01:05:14,640
And in French Playboy,
they're even more naked.

1354
01:05:15,099 --> 01:05:17,978
Mrs. Goshen is looking
for a Turkish loose tea,

1355
01:05:18,035 --> 01:05:20,311
an orange pekoe or mint melody.

1356
01:05:20,371 --> 01:05:23,079
Well, just send her
an assortment, Rose.

1357
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:25,882
"I'm at Lenox Hospital,
my water broke."

1358
01:05:28,012 --> 01:05:29,616
It's happening.
Rose, cover for me.

1359
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,216
I'm having a baby.
I'm having a baby!

1360
01:05:31,282 --> 01:05:32,386
Excuse me.
I'm having a baby.

1361
01:06:02,213 --> 01:06:04,318
Guys, check it out.
Snoopy.

1362
01:06:04,382 --> 01:06:06,259
I like Snoopy.

1363
01:06:06,317 --> 01:06:07,990
Yeah, it's Snoopy.

1364
01:06:08,452 --> 01:06:10,295
- Snoopy!
- Snoopy!

1365
01:06:23,367 --> 01:06:26,507
It's Huang's birthday!
Everybody come and sing.

1366
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:29,050
Ron, Manuel, come and sing.

1367
01:06:29,507 --> 01:06:31,680
Come on, everybody.
Everybody come on, come on now.

1368
01:06:31,742 --> 01:06:33,187
Everybody come on now.

1369
01:06:39,383 --> 01:06:40,987
So what happened
to Mr. Larkin?

1370
01:06:41,052 --> 01:06:42,497
We had to fire Mr. Larkin.

1371
01:06:42,553 --> 01:06:44,362
He was involved with some
illicit sexual behavior

1372
01:06:44,422 --> 01:06:46,402
that we at Chase Manhattan
just will not tolerate.

1373
01:06:46,457 --> 01:06:48,596
If you wanna wear a black leather
hood and whip your own ass,

1374
01:06:48,659 --> 01:06:50,639
work at Bank of America.

1375
01:06:52,396 --> 01:06:54,433
So you'll be taking over
his account, Mr. Davis?

1376
01:06:54,498 --> 01:06:56,444
Yes, I will.
Working holidays?

1377
01:06:56,734 --> 01:06:58,179
We've been very
patient with you

1378
01:06:58,235 --> 01:07:01,148
with regard to the Fitzhugh foreclosure,
but the bank is ready to sell.

1379
01:07:01,205 --> 01:07:03,014
And we'd like to personally
offer you a finder's fee

1380
01:07:03,074 --> 01:07:04,644
if we can move
the remodel along.

1381
01:07:04,709 --> 01:07:06,245
A finder's fee?
Mmm.

1382
01:07:06,577 --> 01:07:08,682
We just started demolishing
the apartment.

1383
01:07:08,746 --> 01:07:09,884
The place is gonna
look like new.

1384
01:07:09,947 --> 01:07:12,018
It's going to be one of the
finest units of the building.

1385
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:13,494
I'd love to see it.
Can I see it?

1386
01:07:14,285 --> 01:07:16,162
Here you go.
There you go.

1387
01:07:29,967 --> 01:07:33,312
Well, looks like the staff
is having a little party.

1388
01:07:43,581 --> 01:07:45,424
We were supposed to
be in that elevator.

1389
01:07:45,483 --> 01:07:46,723
Come on.

1390
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:51,993
We have to go up.
Let's go.

1391
01:07:52,056 --> 01:07:53,967
All the way
to the top?

1392
01:07:55,426 --> 01:07:59,169
So, as you'll see, this entire
apartment is being redone.

1393
01:08:00,331 --> 01:08:02,072
All new appliances.

1394
01:08:03,067 --> 01:08:04,740
Floor-to-ceiling windows.

1395
01:08:04,802 --> 01:08:06,247
Hardwood floors.

1396
01:08:06,303 --> 01:08:07,907
Oh, hardwood floors.
That's nice.

1397
01:08:07,972 --> 01:08:09,417
Tell me, are you gonna
do the closets over?

1398
01:08:09,473 --> 01:08:10,543
Yes, right this way.

1399
01:08:10,608 --> 01:08:11,609
Oh, yes. This way.

1400
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:14,421
This is the master
bedroom closet.

1401
01:08:14,478 --> 01:08:16,082
It'll have new sliding racks.

1402
01:08:16,147 --> 01:08:19,060
And what beautiful doors.
Are these doors made of mahogany?

1403
01:08:19,917 --> 01:08:22,227
Mr. Davis?

1404
01:08:22,286 --> 01:08:24,664
Excuse me, Mr. Davis.
I'm locked in the closet.

1405
01:08:26,524 --> 01:08:27,525
Hello?

1406
01:09:03,527 --> 01:09:04,699
Sorry, no cleaning now.

1407
01:09:05,329 --> 01:09:06,933
It's okay, I'll come back.

1408
01:09:06,997 --> 01:09:08,203
Do you want some cake?

1409
01:09:08,265 --> 01:09:09,972
We're celebrating
a birthday downstairs.

1410
01:09:10,034 --> 01:09:11,035
No, thank you.

1411
01:09:11,302 --> 01:09:13,077
It's amazing cake,
are you sure?

1412
01:09:13,437 --> 01:09:14,973
I'm allergic to chocolate.

1413
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:16,916
I break out in hives.
I can't touch it.

1414
01:09:26,016 --> 01:09:27,461
<i>Bumbaclot!</i>

1415
01:09:29,453 --> 01:09:31,455
You should have
tried the cake, man.

1416
01:09:51,342 --> 01:09:53,549
<i>Odessa,
did he take the cake?</i>

1417
01:09:54,278 --> 01:09:56,451
He's allergic to chocolate.
I had to beat him.

1418
01:10:28,379 --> 01:10:29,687
Oh, shit.

1419
01:10:30,014 --> 01:10:31,049
The maid has gone rogue!

1420
01:10:31,115 --> 01:10:33,117
Put him in the chair.

1421
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,933
Very spacious.

1422
01:11:04,715 --> 01:11:06,456
Got it! Come on.

1423
01:11:36,981 --> 01:11:37,982
Yeah.

1424
01:11:41,485 --> 01:11:42,793
This is incredible.
Yeah.

1425
01:11:42,853 --> 01:11:45,993
I have to hand it to you,
Mr. Kovaks, you were right.

1426
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:47,994
Move away
from the safe.

1427
01:11:48,892 --> 01:11:51,270
I ain't gonna say it again.
Back up!

1428
01:11:51,328 --> 01:11:53,638
Are you serious?
What are you doing?

1429
01:11:53,697 --> 01:11:54,869
Hey, Josh, I'm a thief

1430
01:11:54,932 --> 01:11:56,934
I keep telling you I'm a thief,
but you don't want to believe it

1431
01:11:57,001 --> 01:11:58,878
I know exactly what I am.
You're the one that's confused.

1432
01:11:58,936 --> 01:12:01,439
Now back up before I
pop a cap in your ass.

1433
01:12:01,505 --> 01:12:02,540
No.

1434
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,441
No?

1435
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:05,576
Yeah, no.

1436
01:12:06,276 --> 01:12:07,346
Look at my face.

1437
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:08,446
Look at my face.

1438
01:12:08,712 --> 01:12:09,747
You see how serious I am.

1439
01:12:09,813 --> 01:12:11,121
I'm pretty serious, too.

1440
01:12:11,181 --> 01:12:12,251
Are you ready to die, bitch?

1441
01:12:12,316 --> 01:12:13,522
That's my suit.

1442
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:16,588
Yeah, I got on your suit and your
drawers and socks, too! So what?

1443
01:12:16,654 --> 01:12:17,724
I want my suit back.

1444
01:12:17,788 --> 01:12:21,099
I will blow your face clean off your face!
Now, back up!

1445
01:12:21,325 --> 01:12:23,498
You think I'm gonna let this shit get away?

1446
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,233
You don't
have a choice.

1447
01:12:25,396 --> 01:12:26,773
I brought my own gun.

1448
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:28,935
Now put your shit down,
nice and slow.

1449
01:12:33,737 --> 01:12:37,275
You mess with me, you're a dead man.
Now drop it!

1450
01:12:37,341 --> 01:12:38,445
Okay, all right,
all right, all right.

1451
01:12:38,509 --> 01:12:39,783
I'm putting it down right now.

1452
01:12:39,843 --> 01:12:41,481
Take it easy.

1453
01:12:45,716 --> 01:12:47,753
On the ground,
you punk-ass bitch!

1454
01:12:47,818 --> 01:12:49,991
Bitch, on the ground!
We had a plan! Take it easy.

1455
01:12:50,421 --> 01:12:52,162
We had a plan!
Fitz, calm down.

1456
01:12:52,222 --> 01:12:53,667
Come on now. Shit!
Fitz, take it easy.

1457
01:12:53,724 --> 01:12:54,998
Be cool with the gun, man.
Okay. All right.

1458
01:12:55,059 --> 01:12:56,060
Relax.

1459
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:58,037
I'm relaxed, you relax!

1460
01:12:59,997 --> 01:13:02,876
You sissy... You bitch!

1461
01:13:15,012 --> 01:13:17,959
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
America's queen of comedy,</i>

1462
01:13:18,015 --> 01:13:19,585
<i>Joan Rivers.</i>

1463
01:13:20,284 --> 01:13:22,286
<i>And here's Kanye West.</i>

1464
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:25,129
Charlie,
what are you doing back?

1465
01:13:25,189 --> 01:13:27,294
Rose, please.
I feel like my head's gonna fall off.

1466
01:13:27,357 --> 01:13:30,065
I raced over to the hospital, she's not there.
I can't find her.

1467
01:13:30,127 --> 01:13:31,435
I get into an argument
with 15 doctors.

1468
01:13:31,495 --> 01:13:33,372
I said, "Where's my wife?" They
said, "Your wife's not here."

1469
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:34,534
I called my Uncle
Marty in Brighton.

1470
01:13:34,598 --> 01:13:35,668
I say, "You got
to get over here.

1471
01:13:35,733 --> 01:13:36,973
"She's not here.
Nobody can find her."

1472
01:13:37,034 --> 01:13:38,104
He said, "What do you
mean no one can find her?

1473
01:13:38,168 --> 01:13:39,738
"She's in the television room,
watching television."

1474
01:13:39,803 --> 01:13:41,339
I said, "Are you kidding me?
Put her on the telephone."

1475
01:13:41,405 --> 01:13:42,406
He puts her on the telephone.

1476
01:13:42,473 --> 01:13:44,180
I said, "What are you doing?
Your water didn't break?"

1477
01:13:44,241 --> 01:13:45,777
"No." "Your vagina's
not dilated?" "No."

1478
01:13:45,843 --> 01:13:46,947
I said, "Why did you
send me a text message?

1479
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:51,186
She says, "I didn't send you a text message.
I can't find my phone!"

1480
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:53,690
Have you seen Josh?

1481
01:13:55,285 --> 01:13:58,357
Manuel, will you show me
the penthouse hallway?

1482
01:14:00,991 --> 01:14:03,335
These FBI guys
are always falling asleep.

1483
01:14:04,161 --> 01:14:05,970
Where is Mr. Simon?

1484
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:09,567
He was showing Mr. Fitzhugh's
old apartment to some guy.

1485
01:14:11,268 --> 01:14:14,545
Manuel, do you think something
strange is going on?

1486
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:18,113
They cut Miss Piggy
from the parade.

1487
01:14:18,175 --> 01:14:20,018
I think that's strange.

1488
01:14:28,118 --> 01:14:31,190
Well, it's been nice
meeting you, Agent Denham.

1489
01:14:31,555 --> 01:14:35,230
You know, I'm still trying to decide
if I should go after your badge.

1490
01:14:35,292 --> 01:14:38,034
Either way, no hard
feelings on my part.

1491
01:14:38,328 --> 01:14:41,969
Maybe we could have dinner
sometime, my treat. Huh?

1492
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:54,311
Can I help you?

1493
01:14:54,378 --> 01:14:56,221
We have a meeting
with Judge Hollingsworth.

1494
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,725
Judge Hollingsworth
is down in D.C.

1495
01:14:57,781 --> 01:15:00,022
He goes down every year to spend
the holiday with his daughter.

1496
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:01,153
Are you sure?

1497
01:15:01,218 --> 01:15:03,164
There's no one here today, ma'am.
It's Thanksgiving.

1498
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:05,166
What the hell is going on?

1499
01:15:05,222 --> 01:15:06,257
Back in the car.

1500
01:15:06,323 --> 01:15:07,825
Wait, no. Wait a second.
Back in the car.

1501
01:15:07,891 --> 01:15:09,393
Wait a minute!

1502
01:15:12,629 --> 01:15:15,405
Three, four, five,

1503
01:15:15,632 --> 01:15:18,010
six, seven, eight.

1504
01:15:21,505 --> 01:15:23,246
You open it, Mr. K.

1505
01:15:32,182 --> 01:15:33,183
Wow.

1506
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,456
Oh, my God.

1507
01:15:35,219 --> 01:15:36,960
This can't be real.

1508
01:15:40,357 --> 01:15:42,564
Empty! After all
this shit, it's empty.

1509
01:15:43,093 --> 01:15:44,470
Man, what kind of...

1510
01:15:44,695 --> 01:15:46,470
Give me my gun back.

1511
01:15:47,331 --> 01:15:48,332
This is over.
Give me my gun...

1512
01:15:48,398 --> 01:15:50,344
I might need it to get out of here.
I'm not giving it to you.

1513
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,346
Stop bullshitting and give me the gun.
No! I don't want to.

1514
01:15:52,402 --> 01:15:53,972
Give me the goddamn gun!
Fitz, give him the gun!

1515
01:15:54,037 --> 01:15:56,074
Give him the gun!
Guys. Guys!

1516
01:15:56,406 --> 01:15:57,441
What the hell is
wrong with you, man?

1517
01:15:57,507 --> 01:15:58,679
You gonna kill
somebody in here!

1518
01:15:58,742 --> 01:16:00,847
- Sorry.
- What the hell, man?

1519
01:16:07,784 --> 01:16:09,593
Give me that crowbar.

1520
01:16:10,854 --> 01:16:13,061
What?
Did you find something?

1521
01:16:18,562 --> 01:16:20,564
What is that?
Gold.

1522
01:16:20,631 --> 01:16:22,611
- Real gold?
- Holy shit.

1523
01:16:22,766 --> 01:16:25,508
The hood is solid gold.
Do you have any idea what that's worth?

1524
01:16:26,904 --> 01:16:29,282
It's not just the hood.
It's the whole car.

1525
01:16:29,973 --> 01:16:31,509
This is where he hid the money.

1526
01:16:33,577 --> 01:16:35,579
This car must
weigh 2,000 pounds.

1527
01:16:35,846 --> 01:16:38,383
Sixteen ounces to a pound,
that's 32,000 ounces.

1528
01:16:38,448 --> 01:16:41,759
The current price of
gold is $1,872 per ounce.

1529
01:16:42,419 --> 01:16:44,922
Josh, it's about 45 million.

1530
01:16:45,222 --> 01:16:47,202
Jesus!
$45 million?

1531
01:16:47,891 --> 01:16:49,165
Give or take 10 million.

1532
01:16:49,226 --> 01:16:51,604
Give me that crow bar.
I am going to break a chunk off this bitch.

1533
01:16:51,662 --> 01:16:52,936
Are we going to chop it up?

1534
01:16:52,996 --> 01:16:54,669
How we gonna do that?

1535
01:16:55,699 --> 01:16:56,769
Why don't we take
the whole thing?

1536
01:16:56,833 --> 01:16:57,868
What?

1537
01:16:57,935 --> 01:17:00,176
What are we gonna do?
Roll it out the front door?

1538
01:17:00,237 --> 01:17:01,341
It's not gonna fit.

1539
01:17:01,405 --> 01:17:03,385
It is too big.
It won't go through the door.

1540
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,441
Man.

1541
01:17:04,508 --> 01:17:06,613
And the doors in Fitzhugh's
apartment are torn out.

1542
01:17:06,677 --> 01:17:08,452
Too bad it is six floors down.

1543
01:17:08,779 --> 01:17:09,951
Shit!

1544
01:17:12,249 --> 01:17:13,728
How much you say it weighs?

1545
01:17:40,043 --> 01:17:42,887
It has to be green,
because green means go.

1546
01:17:49,052 --> 01:17:50,531
It's moving.

1547
01:17:58,228 --> 01:17:59,730
This is crazy.

1548
01:18:06,703 --> 01:18:09,206
Josh, this is really crazy.

1549
01:18:13,744 --> 01:18:15,348
Okay, all right.

1550
01:18:15,712 --> 01:18:16,713
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1551
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:21,393
All right.

1552
01:18:25,822 --> 01:18:27,824
Hey, do you know of any reason

1553
01:18:27,891 --> 01:18:30,167
somebody would want you out
of your penthouse right now?

1554
01:18:31,028 --> 01:18:32,302
No.

1555
01:18:33,864 --> 01:18:36,674
Mr. Shaw, I think
you're being robbed.

1556
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:46,912
This is a bad idea.
Really? Which part?

1557
01:18:46,977 --> 01:18:47,978
The part where
you screw us over

1558
01:18:48,045 --> 01:18:49,422
and try to take
everything for yourself?

1559
01:18:49,479 --> 01:18:51,117
Even when you were
six you couldn't share.

1560
01:18:51,181 --> 01:18:52,524
Maybe I just
didn't want to share

1561
01:18:52,582 --> 01:18:53,856
with your silly
seizure-having ass.

1562
01:18:53,917 --> 01:18:55,021
All right, you know what?
That's it!

1563
01:18:55,085 --> 01:18:57,964
I don't want you talking to me
for the rest of the robbery.

1564
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,630
Okay, take it up.

1565
01:19:04,895 --> 01:19:06,135
All right.

1566
01:19:29,252 --> 01:19:30,492
<i>All right, lower it.</i>

1567
01:19:59,916 --> 01:20:02,328
<i>A little more.
A little more.</i>

1568
01:20:03,253 --> 01:20:04,664
<i>Okay, stop!</i>

1569
01:20:06,723 --> 01:20:07,758
<i>Grab it, Fitz!</i>

1570
01:20:09,693 --> 01:20:11,639
You have to reach
out and pull it in.

1571
01:20:12,762 --> 01:20:15,868
I really don't want to do that.
I wanna go home now.

1572
01:20:16,433 --> 01:20:18,174
<i>Home to my old life.</i>

1573
01:20:18,268 --> 01:20:20,908
Do you have any idea
how happy I used to be?

1574
01:20:21,171 --> 01:20:23,617
<i>My wife and I flew
first class to Greece.</i>

1575
01:20:24,674 --> 01:20:26,176
We swam naked.

1576
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:29,716
We ate lamb.

1577
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,655
Stop acting like a bitch
and pull that shit in!

1578
01:20:31,715 --> 01:20:33,388
He's freaking out.
We have to get down there.

1579
01:20:35,652 --> 01:20:36,653
Shit.

1580
01:20:39,189 --> 01:20:40,293
What are you doing?

1581
01:20:40,357 --> 01:20:42,098
That's it, we popped.

1582
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:43,229
We are not popped.

1583
01:20:43,293 --> 01:20:44,294
What are you doing?

1584
01:20:44,361 --> 01:20:45,999
I'm gonna shoot this guy in
the foot when he comes in

1585
01:20:46,062 --> 01:20:47,166
and you are gonna slam
the door in his face.

1586
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:48,265
No, that's a bad idea.

1587
01:20:48,331 --> 01:20:50,174
You shoot the FBI agent in his
foot, he is gonna come in here

1588
01:20:50,233 --> 01:20:52,509
and he is gonna shoot a
nigger in his ass. It's over.

1589
01:20:52,569 --> 01:20:53,604
All right, great.
You give up then.

1590
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:54,705
I'm out of here.
Hey!

1591
01:20:54,771 --> 01:20:57,047
I can do it.
I'm no bitch.

1592
01:20:57,574 --> 01:20:58,678
Yeah.

1593
01:21:04,214 --> 01:21:05,420
Okay...

1594
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:08,195
I can do it.

1595
01:21:09,653 --> 01:21:10,996
It's kind of like sailing.

1596
01:21:21,031 --> 01:21:22,601
Keep moving!

1597
01:21:22,666 --> 01:21:24,009
Easy! Easy! Easy! Easy!

1598
01:21:24,801 --> 01:21:26,439
I'm not going out there.

1599
01:21:39,216 --> 01:21:40,354
I got it!

1600
01:21:42,252 --> 01:21:43,731
I got it!

1601
01:21:45,655 --> 01:21:46,861
Oh, no.

1602
01:21:53,997 --> 01:21:55,203
Yo, we got a dangler!

1603
01:21:55,699 --> 01:21:56,939
Help me!

1604
01:21:57,934 --> 01:21:59,140
Fitzhugh is dangling!

1605
01:21:59,436 --> 01:22:00,881
- Shit!
- Fitz!

1606
01:22:04,808 --> 01:22:05,946
Help!

1607
01:22:06,443 --> 01:22:08,013
I'm gonna fall!

1608
01:22:08,078 --> 01:22:10,422
Josh, help me!

1609
01:22:12,682 --> 01:22:14,059
I don't want to die.

1610
01:22:16,186 --> 01:22:17,187
There's a rope.

1611
01:22:17,821 --> 01:22:18,959
Grab the rope!

1612
01:22:21,324 --> 01:22:22,359
I can't!

1613
01:22:22,425 --> 01:22:24,029
Listen to me.
No!

1614
01:22:24,094 --> 01:22:26,700
Take your hand off the car
and grab the rope!

1615
01:22:27,597 --> 01:22:29,508
It's your only chance!

1616
01:22:36,539 --> 01:22:38,576
Yeah! Reach out!

1617
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:45,425
It's too far!

1618
01:22:45,482 --> 01:22:46,984
No, it's not!

1619
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:58,669
I got you. I got you.

1620
01:23:02,832 --> 01:23:05,176
I got you. Come on.

1621
01:23:06,469 --> 01:23:07,812
What are you doing, man?

1622
01:23:07,871 --> 01:23:09,748
We're stealing the car.

1623
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:14,821
FBI, you got to let us through.

1624
01:23:14,978 --> 01:23:17,549
Can't. The parade is coming right
at us for another half hour.

1625
01:23:17,614 --> 01:23:20,060
You're gonna have to go around
the entire park. I'm sorry.

1626
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:28,235
Holy shit!
Whoa!

1627
01:23:29,225 --> 01:23:30,602
Josh.

1628
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:33,607
<i>Fitzhugh!
What's happening? Are you okay?</i>

1629
01:23:34,097 --> 01:23:36,475
<i>Come in. Fitzhugh!</i>

1630
01:23:36,533 --> 01:23:37,568
Dev'Reaux.

1631
01:23:37,834 --> 01:23:38,904
Charlie?

1632
01:23:40,136 --> 01:23:41,979
Where are you?
The roof!

1633
01:23:42,038 --> 01:23:43,642
We need to swing
the car over to the window.

1634
01:23:49,446 --> 01:23:52,188
<i>Dev'Reaux, I'm gonna
try and reel the car in,</i>

1635
01:23:52,782 --> 01:23:54,318
<i>but I'm gonna need your help.</i>

1636
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,090
I'm starting to
get kind of queasy.

1637
01:23:59,823 --> 01:24:01,427
Fitzhugh, get the rope.
We're gonna hook it.

1638
01:24:05,195 --> 01:24:06,606
I'm gonna call Ralph.
What?

1639
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:08,803
I'm getting ready to call Ralph.
Who's Ralph?

1640
01:24:21,878 --> 01:24:22,913
Pull!

1641
01:24:31,154 --> 01:24:32,189
Hi, gulls...

1642
01:24:32,255 --> 01:24:33,734
God damn it, Josh.

1643
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:35,963
You realize what you have done to me?
You have ruined my life.

1644
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:37,900
Do you understand that
I'm a part of this now?

1645
01:24:37,961 --> 01:24:39,668
And for what?
So you could steal a car?

1646
01:24:39,729 --> 01:24:41,731
Yeah, worth 45 million,
made out of gold.

1647
01:24:41,998 --> 01:24:43,477
Gold?

1648
01:24:43,533 --> 01:24:44,978
It's worth 45 million?

1649
01:24:45,268 --> 01:24:46,542
Give or take 10 million.

1650
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:49,350
All right, come on.
Let's push it into the elevator.

1651
01:24:49,606 --> 01:24:51,017
I don't think it's gonna fit.

1652
01:24:51,074 --> 01:24:53,281
No, it won't fit
in the elevator.

1653
01:24:54,177 --> 01:24:55,815
But it doesn't have to.

1654
01:25:09,192 --> 01:25:12,264
I'm stopping the elevator
right under you guys.

1655
01:25:15,465 --> 01:25:17,741
Okay. So what do we do
when we get it downstairs?

1656
01:25:17,801 --> 01:25:19,474
We'll think of something
Check the glove box.

1657
01:25:19,836 --> 01:25:21,338
Keys have to be here somewhere.

1658
01:25:24,073 --> 01:25:27,316
I don't see any keys.
Nothing.

1659
01:25:38,755 --> 01:25:39,893
Holy shit!

1660
01:25:40,256 --> 01:25:41,360
Josh.

1661
01:25:41,825 --> 01:25:44,328
Can you take Lucy
on a walk for me?

1662
01:25:45,061 --> 01:25:49,305
My feet are swollen,
and there's a goddamn parade.

1663
01:25:50,733 --> 01:25:52,371
You know, now is not a
great time, Mrs. Cronan.

1664
01:25:52,569 --> 01:25:53,707
Charlie,

1665
01:25:53,770 --> 01:25:57,718
give her one of those liver treats
that you keep on your desk.

1666
01:25:58,608 --> 01:25:59,780
Yes, ma'am.

1667
01:25:59,843 --> 01:26:01,379
Thank you.

1668
01:26:14,524 --> 01:26:16,504
Agent Claire Denham
requesting backup

1669
01:26:16,559 --> 01:26:18,470
at The Tower on
Central Park West.

1670
01:26:35,645 --> 01:26:36,851
Okay.

1671
01:27:01,471 --> 01:27:04,418
All right. On three.
One, two, three.

1672
01:27:05,208 --> 01:27:06,209
Come on.

1673
01:27:06,276 --> 01:27:07,846
Easy, easy, easy!

1674
01:27:09,512 --> 01:27:10,650
Okay, it's stable.

1675
01:27:10,713 --> 01:27:12,454
That wasn't so bad.

1676
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,121
Whoa!

1677
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:22,133
What's happening?
Why are we moving?

1678
01:27:22,792 --> 01:27:24,396
It's security!
They're overriding me!

1679
01:27:38,708 --> 01:27:40,244
It's the lobby.

1680
01:27:41,811 --> 01:27:42,846
Shh!

1681
01:28:08,237 --> 01:28:10,274
Fitz. Take her!
Take Lucy! Here.

1682
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:11,444
What? What?

1683
01:28:11,507 --> 01:28:13,316
Okay. I got her.

1684
01:28:25,521 --> 01:28:26,864
<i>No, no. No!</i>

1685
01:28:26,956 --> 01:28:28,526
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

1686
01:28:42,338 --> 01:28:43,942
I think they're gone.

1687
01:28:44,007 --> 01:28:45,384
We need to get out
of here right now.

1688
01:28:46,309 --> 01:28:47,481
Slide.
Yeah.

1689
01:28:47,577 --> 01:28:49,488
We got to use the truck.
Where are the keys?

1690
01:28:49,612 --> 01:28:50,955
Under the sun visor.

1691
01:28:51,347 --> 01:28:53,020
You leave the keys?
In New York?

1692
01:28:53,182 --> 01:28:54,456
It's a stolen car.

1693
01:28:54,684 --> 01:28:57,358
You brought a stolen
car to a robbery?

1694
01:28:58,921 --> 01:29:00,764
<i>Lester,
you still there?</i>

1695
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:03,436
Yeah, I'm here.
I'm holding four cabs at the north door.

1696
01:29:03,526 --> 01:29:04,596
Slight change of plan.

1697
01:29:04,661 --> 01:29:07,699
There's a white truck parked on 60th
and Broadway, keys on the visor.

1698
01:29:07,964 --> 01:29:08,999
<i>You got to back it
up to the elevator.</i>

1699
01:29:09,065 --> 01:29:10,066
I'm on my way.

1700
01:29:28,151 --> 01:29:31,530
Mr. Shaw, tell me
about this safe.

1701
01:29:31,654 --> 01:29:32,792
It's empty...

1702
01:29:32,855 --> 01:29:35,301
Doesn't matter if
it's empty or full.

1703
01:29:35,358 --> 01:29:36,837
A hidden safe
was never mentioned

1704
01:29:36,893 --> 01:29:38,770
in the inventory
of your apartment.

1705
01:29:38,828 --> 01:29:40,239
You neglected to inform us,

1706
01:29:40,296 --> 01:29:42,367
which is a violation of
your parole, therefore...

1707
01:29:42,432 --> 01:29:44,343
Where is my car?
Where is my goddamn car?

1708
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:48,610
I hereby remand you to federal
custody until your real court date.

1709
01:29:48,671 --> 01:29:50,548
You just forfeited $10 million.

1710
01:29:50,606 --> 01:29:52,586
You think I care
about $10 million?

1711
01:29:52,642 --> 01:29:54,883
You think I care if I spend
a few nights in jail?

1712
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:56,787
We both know I'm going to
be out by the weekend.

1713
01:29:56,846 --> 01:29:58,917
But you let that car
leave this building

1714
01:29:58,981 --> 01:30:01,291
and I promise you
won't get off so easy.

1715
01:30:01,951 --> 01:30:03,828
Take him away.
Lock it down.

1716
01:30:04,654 --> 01:30:06,759
This is Agent Huggins.
Lock down the building.

1717
01:30:16,833 --> 01:30:18,506
Show me the garage.

1718
01:30:18,568 --> 01:30:20,411
Okay. Yes, ma'am.

1719
01:30:23,272 --> 01:30:25,513
They got the car.
Come on! Come on!

1720
01:30:41,557 --> 01:30:43,230
There they are!

1721
01:30:43,292 --> 01:30:44,737
Here we go, baby.

1722
01:30:50,833 --> 01:30:52,073
Move out of the way.

1723
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:55,276
Go. Go.

1724
01:31:03,412 --> 01:31:05,153
Get out of the way!

1725
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,132
Careful. Careful.
Jesus Christ!

1726
01:31:19,595 --> 01:31:21,666
Freeze! Do not move!

1727
01:31:23,833 --> 01:31:25,107
Open it.

1728
01:31:32,008 --> 01:31:34,511
Son of a bitch!
It's a diversion.

1729
01:31:39,982 --> 01:31:42,428
Lester, they are gonna get hurt.
There is no way out of this.

1730
01:31:43,085 --> 01:31:44,689
I don't know what
you are talking about.

1731
01:31:44,754 --> 01:31:47,963
All I did is steal a truck
and try to commit suicide

1732
01:32:00,570 --> 01:32:02,948
Mr. Fitzhugh? FBI.
You're under arrest, sir.

1733
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:04,040
Oh.

1734
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:06,848
Please put your hands
behind your back.

1735
01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:11,021
Miss Montero,
FBI, you're under arrest.

1736
01:32:12,815 --> 01:32:15,523
Charlie Gibbs, FBI,
you're under arrest.

1737
01:32:15,585 --> 01:32:16,928
You have the right
to remain silent.

1738
01:32:16,986 --> 01:32:18,465
Anything you say,
can and will be

1739
01:32:18,521 --> 01:32:20,296
used against you
in a court of law.

1740
01:32:20,356 --> 01:32:21,801
You have the right
to an attorney.

1741
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:27,899
Mr. Dev'Reaux, FBI. Show me your hands.
You're under arrest.

1742
01:32:38,674 --> 01:32:40,676
Show me your hands, Josh.

1743
01:32:43,779 --> 01:32:45,383
It was smart.

1744
01:32:45,915 --> 01:32:49,727
Thanksgiving, the parade,
changing the court date,

1745
01:32:50,386 --> 01:32:53,367
using Lester as a
diversion, lying to me.

1746
01:32:54,657 --> 01:32:57,433
We have reservations Saturday night
at six different restaurants.

1747
01:32:57,493 --> 01:33:00,406
I'll give you the names
if you wanna check.

1748
01:33:00,796 --> 01:33:03,242
That's okay, I trust you.

1749
01:33:29,191 --> 01:33:30,397
Where is my car?

1750
01:33:32,929 --> 01:33:34,738
Do you mean
the car made of gold?

1751
01:33:34,797 --> 01:33:37,676
Gold melted down
from the money you stole?

1752
01:33:37,733 --> 01:33:38,803
I haven't seen it.

1753
01:33:39,268 --> 01:33:40,872
They'll find it.

1754
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:44,410
And when they do, my friends on the
bench will take no pity on you.

1755
01:33:44,707 --> 01:33:47,017
They'll make sure you go
away for a very long time.

1756
01:33:47,643 --> 01:33:49,384
See, you people
are working stiffs,

1757
01:33:49,712 --> 01:33:51,123
clock punchers.

1758
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:52,921
Easily replaced and erased.

1759
01:33:53,549 --> 01:33:55,586
And just know that while you
are all sitting in jail,

1760
01:33:55,952 --> 01:33:57,431
I'll be right up
there in the penthouse

1761
01:33:57,486 --> 01:33:59,625
of The Tower,
doing what I do best.

1762
01:34:00,323 --> 01:34:02,064
We may be going to
jail for a few years,

1763
01:34:02,124 --> 01:34:05,503
but you, you're going
for the rest of your life.

1764
01:34:06,095 --> 01:34:07,199
How'd you figure that?

1765
01:34:07,496 --> 01:34:08,668
I found your ledger.

1766
01:34:09,398 --> 01:34:10,604
You know, the one that you stuck

1767
01:34:10,666 --> 01:34:12,737
in the owner's manual
of your Ferrari.

1768
01:34:12,969 --> 01:34:14,004
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1769
01:34:14,303 --> 01:34:16,078
I'm guessing you don't
really care about the car.

1770
01:34:16,138 --> 01:34:17,981
You could care less
about 45 million,

1771
01:34:18,074 --> 01:34:20,611
but I bet you want
that ledger back.

1772
01:34:21,243 --> 01:34:22,586
Am I right?

1773
01:34:22,645 --> 01:34:23,817
What do you think you're doing?

1774
01:34:26,382 --> 01:34:28,191
Sacrificing my queen.

1775
01:34:32,755 --> 01:34:35,065
Okay, you and I are gonna
make a deal, Josh.

1776
01:34:35,124 --> 01:34:38,662
A deal that will make you and
your friends very wealthy.

1777
01:34:39,362 --> 01:34:42,070
Do you think that car has value?
Multiply it by 10.

1778
01:34:42,665 --> 01:34:44,008
In cash.

1779
01:34:48,537 --> 01:34:50,380
Dev'Reaux, will you
please remind Mr. Shaw?

1780
01:34:51,907 --> 01:34:55,377
I'm very sorry, Mr. Shaw, but we
don't accept tips at The Tower.

1781
01:34:59,448 --> 01:35:00,791
Checkmate.

1782
01:35:08,691 --> 01:35:10,136
Hello!

1783
01:35:15,798 --> 01:35:18,472
We've got FBI agents and
police all over the city.

1784
01:35:18,534 --> 01:35:20,605
We know about your friend
Slide from Astoria.

1785
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:22,313
Your little trick
with Lester may have

1786
01:35:22,371 --> 01:35:23,645
gotten the car
out of the building,

1787
01:35:23,739 --> 01:35:26,948
but it's just a matter of
time before we find it.

1788
01:35:28,744 --> 01:35:30,052
Who is this?

1789
01:35:30,112 --> 01:35:31,147
Director Mazin.

1790
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:33,690
I am Mr. Kovaks' attorney,
Miss lovenko.

1791
01:35:33,783 --> 01:35:36,024
I will be representing all
the defendants in this case.

1792
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:40,696
And you're licensed to practice
in the state of New York?

1793
01:35:41,190 --> 01:35:43,602
I passed the bar
three days ago.

1794
01:35:48,164 --> 01:35:50,804
I'd like to request the immediate
release of all the defendants.

1795
01:35:52,168 --> 01:35:53,408
On what grounds?

1796
01:35:57,673 --> 01:35:59,346
These are Mr. Shaw's
hand-written notes

1797
01:35:59,408 --> 01:36:01,388
detailing his fraudulent
business practices.

1798
01:36:01,444 --> 01:36:03,390
There are names, dates,
account numbers.

1799
01:36:03,446 --> 01:36:04,948
My guess is you'll find
enough evidence in there

1800
01:36:05,014 --> 01:36:06,322
to put him away
for a very long time.

1801
01:36:06,382 --> 01:36:09,329
But this only happens
if my clients walk.

1802
01:36:10,252 --> 01:36:11,959
You've been a lawyer
for less than a week

1803
01:36:12,054 --> 01:36:14,830
and you're trying to bribe the
United States government?

1804
01:36:15,758 --> 01:36:17,999
Sharks are born swimming, sir.

1805
01:36:25,267 --> 01:36:27,144
I'll let everyone
walk but Kovaks.

1806
01:36:27,636 --> 01:36:31,778
As a first-time offender, he'll
probably get two years for the car.

1807
01:36:32,541 --> 01:36:33,918
Best I can do.

1808
01:36:39,748 --> 01:36:41,591
Nobody else will be charged?

1809
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,591
<i>New evidence
in the Arthur Shaw trial</i>

1810
01:36:46,655 --> 01:36:49,761
<i>has prompted a new plea
from the accused swindler.</i>

1811
01:36:49,825 --> 01:36:52,032
<i>Sources are now
confirming that Mr. Shaw</i>

1812
01:36:52,094 --> 01:36:54,438
<i>will enter
a guilty plea next week.</i>

1813
01:36:59,001 --> 01:37:01,208
Are we gonna do this or what?
Mmm-hmm.

1814
01:37:15,518 --> 01:37:17,020
Hallelujah!

1815
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:27,463
Welcome to the
penthouse, Mr. Shaw.

1816
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:30,034
Look who's coming now.

1817
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:34,408
Wait until I get
a hold of your wrinkled ass.

1818
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:36,416
He looks good!

1819
01:37:46,282 --> 01:37:47,852
Are you Rose Demato?
Yes.

1820
01:37:47,917 --> 01:37:49,362
Sign right here, please.

1821
01:37:51,487 --> 01:37:52,659
All right, thanks.

1822
01:38:16,712 --> 01:38:18,282
It's a gold wheel!
