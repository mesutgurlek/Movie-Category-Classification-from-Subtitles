1
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,204
SALESMAN 1: Yeah,
it's expensive, but it's sweet.

2
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:43,375
Yeah. Are you familiar with
Gibson humbucking pickups at all, or...

3
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,047
No, I'm sorry. I actually don't play.
It's for my dad for his 50th birthday.

4
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,548
That's... That's really sweet.

5
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,508
Yeah, my sisters
and I are all chipping in, so...

6
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,596
Your dad will love these humbuckings.
I mean, they really kick ass.

7
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,097
Excuse me,
I just have a quick question about...

8
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,850
So, what kind of music
does your dad play?

9
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,060
Um...

10
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,980
I guess it's kind of jazz-ish, maybe?

11
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,400
This is an excellent jazz guitar.
Pat Metheny plays one of these.

12
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,486
- Probably the best one.
- Yeah.

13
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,613
Is your dad into Metheny at all?

14
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:16,116
Oh, I'm sorry.
I actually have no idea who that is.

15
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,536
Pat Metheny is probably
the best fusion player of our times.

16
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,747
He's like the Jake E. Lee
of fusion guitar players.

17
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,249
- Yeah, are you into fusion?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,043
I don't really know what that is, either.

19
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:30,005
It's just... I was asking because I...
I play fusion guitar. Just curious.

20
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,423
Yeah, I play fusion, too, actually.

21
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,591
SALESMAN 1: I teach kids.
I work with kids.

22
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,884
- Really?
- Yeah, I work with a lot of kids.

23
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:34,927
One quick...

24
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,261
SALESMAN 1: You should come
check our band out.

25
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,847
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- Okay. Sure. That's awesome.

26
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,099
Yeah. So what do you think?

27
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,102
Well, do you guys maybe have it
in other colors?

28
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,229
Color? You mean finishes.

29
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,272
- SALESMAN 1: Meant finishes.
- Yeah, sorry.

30
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,191
We have a sunburst. It's beautiful.

31
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,276
Yeah, I just stocked one of those
in the back. I can go grab it.

32
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,444
- No, I can pick it up.
- You want to see it?

33
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,071
- No, I'll get it. It comes with a case.
- I'll get it.

34
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,949
- I'm going to get the case.
- CINDY: Yeah, okay. Thank you.

35
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,283
I'm gonna get...
I'm gonna grab the case.

36
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,660
CINDY: (CHUCKLING) Awesome.

37
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,920
(SINGING) Well, I said, friend

38
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,465
Don't take her, she's all I've got

39
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:19,721
Please don't take her love
away from me

40
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,600
I'm beggin' you, friend

41
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,979
Don't take her, she's all I've got

42
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,064
Oh, shit!

43
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,111
She's everything in life I'll ever need

44
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,197
She is life

45
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,660
When I want to live

46
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:48,458
She's everything to me in life
that life can give

47
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,669
She's my water

48
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,921
That's not really my thing.

49
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,007
When I need a drink

50
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,219
She's the first thought in my mind

51
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,013
- Hey, Step.
- Hi there, Joel.

52
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,931
- Mary.
- Hello, Joel.

53
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,766
Let me tell you now, friend

54
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,854
Don't take her, she's all I've got

55
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:15,152
Please don't take her love
away from me

56
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,739
I'm beggin' you, friend

57
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,784
Don't take her, she's all I've got

58
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:29,917
She's everything in life
I'm ever gonna need

59
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,253
She's my fingers

60
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,424
When I want to feel

61
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:44,056
She's the only thing in life to me
that's really real

62
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,934
Let me tell you now, friend

63
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,812
Don't take her, she's all I've got

64
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:56,902
Please don't take her love
away from me

65
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,656
I'm beggin' you, friend

66
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,449
You know, I don't know what to...

67
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,202
- They come in and...
- That's right. They're doing...

68
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:11,750
She's everything in life
I'm ever gonna need

69
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,005
DEAN: You should come by tonight.

70
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,299
It's half-price well drinks
while the game's going.

71
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,218
Well, you always
give me free drinks, though.

72
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,345
I know. You should come by.

73
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,139
Might as well. There's no action going
on at my house, that's for sure.

74
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,183
Why not? Is your wife out of town?

75
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,978
No, I just haven't been laid
in about a month.

76
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,484
Hey, did you get this job
through Job 1?

77
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,320
Me, too.

78
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,155
I started right there
on the assembly line,

79
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,782
just like you.

80
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,244
Only I did better. Forty crates a day.

81
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:52,207
That's right, vato.
I'm the best sorter in here.

82
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:57,462
Yep. Probably gonna make me
floor manager at the end of this year.

83
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,256
- That's why they made me full-time.
- You see that?

84
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,508
That new guy? He's holding us up.

85
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,303
It's not my job to tell him
to hold the line, either.

86
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:08,682
Hey. My band's playing on Friday.
You should check us out.

87
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,226
It's pronounced "God's cock."

88
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,105
What kind of music do you listen to?
Rock?

89
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,315
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

90
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,817
Yeah. Yeah. You'll like this.

91
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,945
Ladies are free,
so bring some chicks, okay?

92
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,907
Typical, typical.

93
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,493
I'm just going to sit here.

94
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,703
You're not going to shut it off?

95
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,954
I'm not going to hold the line.

96
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,958
If they're not going to do their jobs,
I'm not going to do mine.

97
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,003
Well, if I don't get home
before about 8:00,

98
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,338
she puts on the sweatpants,

99
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,590
and once the sweatpants are on,
I get nothing.

100
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,550
You know, it's over.

101
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,801
Shit.

102
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,097
Damn it!

103
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,352
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

104
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,395
What is he doing?
That's what I want to know.

105
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,564
- Yeah? Why you ganging up on us?
- That is your job.

106
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,359
We can't do our job
if they don't do their job!

107
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,861
We're the only ones
that do our work around here!

108
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,947
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

109
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,575
What is the problem? Let's settle down.

110
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,826
Mary.

111
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,661
(SHUSHING)

112
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,374
Hector's new here, okay?

113
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,627
It's gonna take him a couple of days,
so you've got to be patient.

114
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,712
Step, listen. This is something
you're gonna have to deal with

115
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,130
if you want to be floor manager,
you got that?

116
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,423
Exactly.

117
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,385
Great. Well, let's clean all this up, okay,
and get back to rolling.

118
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,303
We cannot afford to fall behind today.
Let's go.

119
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,305
Back to your station.

120
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,392
See that? We always get the blame.

121
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,394
Jesus, they're like a bunch of
damn children, you know?

122
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,937
I feel like a babysitter.

123
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,940
Sorry I missed the drama this morning.
I was showing boy genius down there

124
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,109
how to back up a forklift.

125
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,403
(SCOFFS) Look at him.

126
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,197
That's his whole career, you know?
Driving that damn forklift.

127
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,408
You'd think he'd want to learn how.

128
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,743
Well, he does have that band
that he's involved in, as well.

129
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,620
(SCOFFS) Yeah, right. Band.

130
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,998
I bet you dollars to donuts
he sucks at that, too.

131
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,585
- Then you got dinkus down there.
- Who? Mary?

132
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,963
No, no. The other one.
What's-her-face?

133
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:07,175
She asked me, or rather "aksed me,"
for more personal days.

134
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,885
Just like that.

135
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,431
I told her maybe if she figures out
how to fill out her timesheets correctly,

136
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,016
I will give her more personal days.

137
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:19,146
Don't worry. She will never fill out
her timesheets correctly.

138
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,522
I better get out of here.

139
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:24,651
Got to beat
that 8:00 sweatpant-deadline thing.

140
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,957
Oh, shit. Do not notice me.

141
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,544
Do not notice me. Just go back inside.
Go back inside.

142
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,088
God damn it! Hey.

143
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,641
Hey, Joel. Glad I caught you.
How have you been?

144
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,977
I'm in such a hurry right now, Nathan.

145
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,437
Yeah? You've been busy?

146
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,938
Yes. Very, very, very busy.

147
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,316
And I'm so busy right now,
I gotta go make a phone call.

148
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,526
Gotta call the office
before they all leave for the day.

149
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:10,113
Yeah. Hey, listen.
Real quick, while I've got you here,

150
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,074
what are you guys doing
November 17th?

151
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,079
On the 17th? Um...

152
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,416
On the 17th,
I think that we're out of town.

153
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,460
Oh, yeah? Where you going?

154
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,086
(CLICKS TONGUE)

155
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,924
- Um...
- Wait a minute. I meant the seventh.

156
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,344
You guys will definitely
be in town then, right?

157
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:33,970
Yep.

158
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,182
Great. Leslie and I are going
to this dinner.

159
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,685
It's an annual thing.
We go every year with the Rotary Club.

160
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,855
It's for charity.
It's just a whole lot of fun.

161
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,358
And we would like to invite you
and Suzie

162
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,859
to be our guests at our table...

163
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,446
Nathan, I just... I don't think that that's
something that we're gonna want to do.

164
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,697
- Really?
- Yeah.

165
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,324
Why not? It's a lot of fun.

166
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,117
I don't know.

167
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,413
Suzie doesn't like going
to those kinds of things.

168
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,290
Why not?

169
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,545
We wouldn't know anybody,
and she gets really uncomfortable.

170
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,213
- Oh, it's not like that.
- Sure it is.

171
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:12,717
No, she won't feel uncomfortable.
It's not formal or anything.

172
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,679
It's just a real loose bunch.

173
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,097
You know, I...

174
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,808
Tell you what. Why don't we do this?

175
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,810
I'm gonna go ahead
and buy those tickets,

176
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,770
since they're gonna sell out fast.

177
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,773
You talk to Suzie. See what she says.

178
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,234
Maybe I'll have Leslie give her a call.

179
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,945
You know how it is
when the wives start talking.

180
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,989
(CHUCKLING)

181
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,865
- I can almost hear it...
- We're gonna talk about this later.

182
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,909
Got to make the call.

183
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,800
Sorry, Joel, I almost forgot.

184
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,052
The tickets are $40 a plate.

185
00:09:56,137 --> 00:10:00,265
Now, I know that's a little bit steep,
but the food is fantastic.

186
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,434
So, that's $80 total.
There's no tax or anything.

187
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,436
Nathan, I really gotta get inside
and make this phone call.

188
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,771
You and I are gonna talk about this
some other time, okay?

189
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,357
You go do that. Hey, Joel?

190
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,234
If you want us to look out
after the house

191
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,486
while you're gone or anything,
we can do that.

192
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,989
- I appreciate that.
- Okay. Yup.

193
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,242
Hey, where you guys going, anyway?

194
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,787
We're going on vacation.

195
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:27,542
Gosh, I tell you, Leslie and I would love
to go on a vacation with you guys.

196

(SIGHS)

197
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,756
I gotta go.

198
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,966
All right, then.

199
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,635
I appreciate it, Nathan.
Thank you so much.

200
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,428
You do your thing.

201
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,265
Joel? One more thing.

202
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,643
Hey, Joel?

203
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,234
- Hon.
- Hi.

204
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,945
Man, that Nathan won't shut up.

205
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,491
Oh, I know. What an asshole.
That wife of his is even worse.

206
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,535
I mean, I wonder how long he would
talk if you just let him go, you know?

207
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,872
I'm actually afraid
to go into our own front yard sometimes

208
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,583
because I'm afraid
he's going to be milling around.

209
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,168
Remember when we had our condo?

210
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,671
We could just go
straight from the garage inside.

211
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,381
No one would bother us.

212
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,632
We could walk to 7-Eleven.

213
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,716
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

214
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,511
We didn't have to worry
about plumbers or pool cleaners.

215
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,554
Speaking of that,
we've got to hire a new pool cleaner.

216
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,391
He never checks the chlorine levels.

217
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,479
Sorry, it's just this new synthetic vanilla

218
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,272
has a much higher triple point
than we thought,

219
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,149
which means that
the new cookies-and-cream extract

220
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,193
that we've been working on
could really work,

221
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:39,239
and I just... I gotta get to this
before Weber Flavors beats us to it,

222
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,701
'cause if something like this caught on,
it could be big.

223
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,453
Could sell the company.

224
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,333
Do you remember
that logo that you designed

225
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,585
for the original
cookies-and-cream extract?

226
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,005
I still have that framed in my office.
Do you remember it?

227
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,968
Yeah. And now I design coupons.

228
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,474
Do you want to go to the bedroom?

229
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,104
- Oh, I'm a little tired.
- Really?

230
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,566
Yeah, just... I don't know.
It's the middle of the week.

231
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,735
It's not the middle of the week.
It's Monday, baby.

232
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,819
It's Monday? Shit!

233
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,029
- What happened?
- Dancing with the Stars.

234
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,281
(DANCING WITH THE STARS THEME

00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,824

I gotta get a house
that's got a bathroom

238
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,625
that doesn't share a wall with the TV.

239
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,627
Why would you do that?

240
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,046
Because it is a little tough to jerk it

241
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,591
with the TV blaring at you
through the wall, Dean.

242
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,468
Well, why don't you use
one of the other two bathrooms?

243
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,511
It'd be too suspicious.
We don't use those bathrooms.

244
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,014
I'll just...
I'll put some insulation in or something.

245
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,515
Insulation?

246
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,102
You do not need
to put fiberglass in your walls

247
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,772
because you have so much
masturbation shame.

248
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,066
You need to take responsibility
for yourself and snap one off

249
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,486
wherever you want to
in your own home.

250
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,947
You own your house.
You own your own business.

251
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,033
I mean,
you used to be a bartender here.

252
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,451
Now look at what you have.

253
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,037
I know, but come on. What...
What, really, do I have?

254
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,538
Okay? It's a pain in the ass.

255
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,749
I work all the time.
What does it get me?

256
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,834
Nobody cares about extracts,
certainly not my wife.

257
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,338
The stock guy with the shitty band
probably gets laid more often than I do.

258
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,466
Yeah, but he probably lives
in a really crappy apartment.

259
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,885
I would very gladly move
into a crappy apartment

260
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,888
if the bathroom
wasn't right next to the TV.

CINDY: It belonged to my father.

262
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,769
He passed away last month
and we have all these stupid bills,

263
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,854
and it's just been really hard for me,
you know?

264
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,315
He was really into fusion.

265
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,151
You know, I'm not supposed to say this,

266
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,946
but given the circumstances,

267
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,657
you know, you could take this
down to the music store

268
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,991
and get a lot better deal.

269
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,994
No, that's okay. Really.
I just wanna get this over with.

270
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,664
- I just want it gone.
- I understand. I understand. Here.

271
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:56,709
I just... I want you to have a little extra.
Here. Come on.

272
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,797
- No. No, no, no. I couldn't. No. No.
- No, no. Just... Just take the money.

273
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,800
You've been through enough already.
Come on.

274
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,010
Okay. Okay.

275
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,846
Oh, my gosh.

276
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,267
God bless you. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

277
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,648
Hey.

278
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,192
Are we still looking into
replacing her with a robot?

279
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,820
Yeah, sure. But we might not have to.

280
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,280
You're not gonna believe this,
but remember that guy,

281
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,031
Michael J. Natherton
from General Mills,

282
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,325
who called a while back, talking like
he might want to buy us out?

283
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,369
Yeah. I thought you said
that he wasn't serious,

284
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,579
he was just kicking the tires.

285
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,123
Yeah, well, he's serious now.
He just made us an offer.

286
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,958
- I mean, a real offer.
- Are you kidding me?

287
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,918
It must be part of some
bigger strategic move,

288
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,921
because this is over market value,
I think.

289
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,218
Wow.

290
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,890
I might be able to finally unload
all this stuff and retire, huh?

291
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,266
I mean,
there's a lot of details to work out,

292
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,311
but, yeah, this... This could be great.

293
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,148
He says he'll call back next week.
What should I tell him?

294
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,693
You tell him, "Hell, yes."

295
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,403
Adiós, dinkus.

296
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,073
You see that?

297
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,409
I already warned him.
This is the last time.

298
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,620
I'm just gonna sit here.

299
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,797
Oh, no. What now?

300
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,643
(EXCLAIMING)

301
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,519
Oh!

302
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,888
I knew it. That's what happens
when you don't pay attention.

303
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,099
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

304
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,731
Yeah, all right.
Just call me if you hear anything else.

305
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,485
He definitely lost one of them,
and they think

306
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,821
that they can reattach the other one,
but they're not sure.

307
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,031
Wow. That's hardcore.

308
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,658
I have no idea how this happened.

309
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,827
We've got such a good safety record,

310
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,996
and we comply
with all the safety codes.

311
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,332
I think it was just some kind
of a freak accident, you know?

312
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,126
Well, you probably have insurance
for that, right?

313
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,670
Yeah, of course. He's probably
gonna get a huge settlement.

314
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,505
Yeah, I would think so.

315
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,466
I mean, it's your balls.

316
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:55,388
It kind of makes you think, doesn't it,
how fragile we all are?

317
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,183
Especially our balls.
They're just hanging there.

318
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,144
A little sack.

319
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,355
Any minute,
could just be cut off forever.

320
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,150
What'd life be like,
walking around without testicles?

321
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,526
Can you imagine that shit?

322
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,029
Yeah, actually,
I rarely use my balls anymore at all.

323
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,071
What about the other night?

324
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,115
I thought you were gonna rub one out
to Dancing with the Stars.

325
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,159
I mean that, you know,

326
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:19,495
Suzie and I have sex
maybe once every three months.

327
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,124
You know,
sexual frustration is really hard.

328
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,918
But I may have a solution.

329
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,130
- What?
- You need to take some Xanax.

330
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,051
Xanax? Isn't that for anxiety?

331
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,888
It's good for all psychological problems
in the DSM-IV.

332
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,184
Xanax basically
just makes you feel good.

333
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,270
That's why it works for everything.

334
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,482
I take it for the common head cold.

335
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,652
I think it would work great
for sexual frustration.

336
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,821
- Want me to get you some?
- No, I don't.

337
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,909
You know what else is good?
Codeine cough syrup.

338
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,745
- For what?
- It's just good.

339
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,864
FEMALE OPERATOR: What listing?

340
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,868
Don Wilkinson or Step Wilkinson.

341
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,496
- One moment.
- Can I have the address, please?

342
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,331
I'm sorry.
I'm not showing anything for either.

343
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,000
There's a D. Wilkinson,
but it's unlisted.

344
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,045
Okay. Thank you.

345
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,968
So, the guys at General Mills

346
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,762
got wind of this whole
testicular incident

347
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,597
and they're worried.

348
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,975
If Step decides to sue us
beyond the insurance settlement,

349
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,561
that could be a serious liability.

350
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,312
How is Step doing, anyway?

351
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,149
Better.
I guess he might be going home today.

352
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,233
Oh, good.

353
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,651
Anyway, I guess
we don't have to worry about it.

354
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,987
He says he's not going to sue us.

355
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,947
(IMITATING STEP) Says he
wouldn't want something for nothing,

356
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,491
you know, and what's right is right.

357
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,743
He's being pretty mellow about this.

358
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,078
Yeah.

359
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,582
I think when you lose your balls,
it kind of mellows you out.

360
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,003
Oh, by the way,
guess who asked for a raise today?

361
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,589
- Who?
- Dinkus. Can you believe that?

362
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,507
Brian, you know,
you call everyone here dinkus.

363
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,426
I don't know who you're talking about.

364
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,595
- You know, forklift dinkus.
- Oh.

365
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,015
I thought you call him "boy genius."

366
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,934
Oh, right. Yeah.
Well, boy genius asked for a raise.

367
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,352
I said, "Are you kidding me?

368
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,854
"You almost got somebody
killed last week."

369
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,315
And then he tried to blame it
on dinkus over there.

370
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,525
You know, you really ought to learn
the employees' names.

371
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,235
Yeah, I was thinking about that,
but then I figured,

372
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,863
hey, if this deal goes through
next week, I won't have to.

373
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:03,534
It's not like I'm gonna be inviting dinkus
and boy genius over for dinner.

374
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:07,038
Oh, Joel, let me introduce you
to the new temps here.

375
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,457
One of them wanted to meet you.

376
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,460
Joel, this is Cindy.

377
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,546
- Hi.
- Hi.

378
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,299
(MOUTHING) Oh, my God.

379
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,134
And...

380
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,721
I'm sorry. I forgot your name.

381
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,931
- Victor.
- Victor! Right.

382
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,183
Hi. Joel. Welcome.

383
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,977
- Okay.
- BRIAN: Mmm-hmm.

384
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,532
- Hey.
- Hi.

385
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:50,414
Look, I'm so sorry, but are you really
the owner of this entire place?

386
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,375
Yeah.

387
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,503
I mean, like, you...
You started it and everything?

388
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,172
Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.

389
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,342
Oh, my God. How?

390
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,889
Just... You really wanna hear this?
A lot of people think it's boring.

391
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,725
No, no. I... Really, I do. I wanna know.

392
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,104
I mean, did you, like,
invent extract or something?

393
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,440
- Kind of.
- Really?

394
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,609
Well, my mother used to...

395
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,737
My mother used to make
these root-beer cookies,

396
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,240
and I always noticed
that the cookie dough

397
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,950
tasted better
than the cookies themselves,

398
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,201
and I thought, "Why is that?"

399
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,995
And it turns out that a lot of the flavor

400
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,664
in the root-beer extract evaporates
when you cook it,

401
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:35,084
and so when I was in graduate school,
in chemistry,

402
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,004
I figured out a way
to use this synthetic derivative

403
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,965
of the wintergreen component,
and it just...

404
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:45,553
It doesn't evaporate as easily.
And from that, you know...

405
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,722
Wow.

406
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:52,643
I mean, you... You figured
all of that out, like, with your brain!

407
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,563
- Yeah.
- Oh, you must be really rich.

408
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,317
I've got a 7 Series BMW
and some pretty nice clothes.

409
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,402
You know so many people.

410
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,655
- I...
- Oh, my God. You are really popular.

411
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,575
(LAUGHING)

412
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,535
What?

413
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:13,122
It's just really cute
how your sixes look like eights.

414
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,624
Or is it more like your eights
look like sixes?

415
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,084
Which one is it?

416
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,669
Hey, dude.
You wanna hit some golf balls, man?

417
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,880
Hey, Dean. Cindy, here.

418
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,423
Oh, damn.

419
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,634
Goodness. Hi. Dean.

420
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,054
Entrepreneur, spiritualist, healer.

421
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,180
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

422
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,973
Nice to meet you.
Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.

423
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,350
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Welcome aboard.

424
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,144
We're gonna play some golf,
but maybe we could all just hang out?

425
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,896
- Dean?
- Dude.

426
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,523
Does she work here?

427
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,858
Yeah, she's a temp.

428
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,819
- She's a tramp?
- Temp!

429
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,323
And please don't stare at her.
Get away from the window.

430
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,284
I like it, Joel. I like your style.

431
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,079
Well, I didn't hire her.
She came over through Job 1.

432
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,997
They just sent her over
like everyone else.

433
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:59,710
Job 1, huh?
I got to give those guys a call, man.

434
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,882
I have never seen a woman
anywhere near that hot working here.

435
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:09,053
Makes sense, though, huh?
I mean, hot girls need jobs, too, right?

436
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,389
Do they really?

437
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:16,060
I mean, most of your temps
look like winos, man, and they're guys.

438
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,063
- You wanna hear something weird, too?
- Yeah.

439
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,565
I think that she was flirting with me.

440
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,067
Really?

441
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,403
- Could be wrong.
- No, I'm sure, man.

442
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,239
Dude, you could probably have any girl
out there, that's walking around,

443
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,574
anyone that you see right now
with the hairnet on, man,

444
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,659
you could probably nail.

445
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,078
- I don't know about that.
- I'm telling you, man,

446
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,496
you're the king of this whole domain.

447
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,456
This is your place.
You're the ruler here.

448
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,542
You're the king of the...

449
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,876
What is this shit
you're making out here?

450
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,087
It's extract,
and it's spray-dried flavoring, and...

451
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,214
You're the extract king, man.

452
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,550
And these females out here sense that,

453
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,677
and you can have them if you want that,
you know?

454
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,347
I personally wouldn't, because
they're not sexually attractive to me,

455
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,308
but, you know, that girl right there...

456
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,186
...good for you, Joel.
- MARY: Somebody stole my purse!

457
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,604
What the shit?

458
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:05,734
My purse is stolen! It's gone! He did it!
He stole my purse! You!

459
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,611
You stole my purse! He did it!

460
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,280
- He did it! He stole my purse!
- Hey, wait, wait!

461
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,364
- I told you about him!
- Calm down!

462
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,449
Calm down one minute, will you?

463
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,742
I'm not gonna calm down!
I'm gonna call the cops!

464
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:17,288
Will you please time out?
I speak the language, okay? Hector.

465
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,709
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

466
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,379
- You know, purse-o?
- Purse! That's right!

467
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,630
You stole my purse
and took my money!

468
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,507
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute, okay?
- He stole my purse.

469
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,135
Give me a break, please?
How do you know it's stolen?

470
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,596
I know it's stolen because it's gone,
that's how!

471
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,638
What does it look like?

472
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,141
It's a white leather
multi-colored patchwork purse

473
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:40,352
with a turquoise lining
and a cute little teddy bear in a tutu!

474
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,332
(SINGING) You didn't have to love me
like you did

475
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,876
But you did, but you did

476
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,754
And I thank you

477
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,049
You didn't have to love me like you did

478
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,426
But you did, but you did

479
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,429
And I thank you

480
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,767
But you took your love to someone else

481
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:24,146
I wouldn't know what it meant
to be loved to death

482
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,776
You made me feel like I've never felt

483
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,239
Kisses so good I had to holler for help

484
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,367
You didn't have to hold it, but you did

485
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,869
But you did, but you did

486
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,330
And I thank you

487
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,385
You can go ahead of me
if that's all you got.

488
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,720
- Really?
- Yeah, sure.

489
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,305
Are you sure?

490
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:02,059
That's really, really sweet of you.
Thank you.

491
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,728
I can't believe
I'm buying Reynold's Extract.

492
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,815
I mean, I work at the factory, you know?

493
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,025
Really? I work there, too.

494
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,735
Are you serious?

495
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,281
Yeah, I sure do.
Well, I used to, but... Yeah.

496
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,491
Well, I just started working there.

497
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,452
Yeah, I'm the fastest sorter there.

498
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,831
- Really?
- Yeah. Forty crates a day.

499
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,750
They were gonna make me
floor manager.

500
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,960
Well, I'm Cindy.

501
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,298
(DOOR CLOSES)

502
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:49,607
We don't do it anymore, you know?
It's... We just... I don't know what to do.

503
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:53,277
We're turning into one of those
brother-sister couples.

504
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,362
You do kind of look alike.

505
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,114
- No, we don't.
- Okay.

506
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,824
And to make things worse,

507
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:02,953
Dean, I cannot get
that Cindy girl out of my mind.

508
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,540
And how often am I going
to meet a girl that pretty

509
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,627
and that into food flavoring? It's just...

510
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,295
You know she practically
asked me out?

511
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,297
She gave me her phone number
and everything.

512
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,050
Asked me if I was going to that party
where Rory's band is playing.

513
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,301
- Can you believe that?
- Really?

514
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,219
- Yeah.
- What are you going to do?

515
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,304
What do you mean,
what am I gonna do?

516
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,972
I'm gonna do nothing.
I can't cheat on Suzie.

517
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,142
I just got to power through it
until I'm too old to get it up, you know?

518
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,393
Then I'll be all right.

519
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,312
What if Suzie cheated on you?

520
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,731
(SCOFFS) Right. Come on.

521
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:34,026
Listen, man. I like Suzie.
You know what I'm saying?

522
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,653
And I got nothing against her,

523
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:39,406
but what if she's feeling
the same way you were? Right?

524
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,785
What if she cheated on you?
Would that bother you?

525
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,749
I don't... No, I guess...
No, I guess it wouldn't, at this point.

526
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,542
I guess that's a little weird, isn't it?

527
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,754
Yeah, a bit, but, you know,
do you think she would do it?

528
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,339
- What? Cheat on me? No.
- You sure?

529
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,925
Well, I don't know, actually.
Hang on. She might.

530
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,260
Suzie might.
She could be tempted, I suppose.

531
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,596
If some really studly guy hit on her...

532
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:07,142
So, you're saying
that she would cheat on you

533
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,852
if she were placed in temptation's way,

534
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,730
and yet you're in temptation's way
and you're not cheating on her?

535
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,565
- That's right.
- Okay, bro.

536
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,025
Here's what you need to do.

537
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,986
- I don't want drugs, Dean.
- There are ways,

538
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:22,324
ancient ways from Aztec times

539
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:27,454
of getting your wife to cheat on you,
if that is what you need.

540
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,664
Let's hear it.

541
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,750
You hire a gigolo

542
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,546
to have an affair with your wife.

543
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,134
- What?
- I'm serious, bro. I know a guy.

544
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,052
- You know a gigolo?
- Yes, I do.

545
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,303
How do you know a gigolo?

546
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,180
- This guy, Brad.
- Brad the gigolo?

547
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:49,017
Yes, who comes in here all the time.
He's friends of Cliff.

548
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,104
You hire Brad.
He has an affair with Suzie.

549
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,023
All right. Yeah. Don't you have
another customer to help or something?

550
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,109
Dude, you just told me
that you wouldn't mind

551
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,736
if she fooled around
with somebody else.

552
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,862
And if she fools around
with somebody else,

553
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,906
you have no guilty feelings
about hooking up with Cindy.

554
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:08,245
All your problems are solved.
Stroke-of-genius idea on my part.

555
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,748
Jesus Christ,
maybe I will try some of your Xanax.

556
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,624
- Come on.
- Seriously.

557
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,335
I think what I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna sit Suzie down

558
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,462
and I'm just gonna talk to her about it.

559
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,131
- Bing!
- No, that was a joke.

560
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,924
Not a joke.

561
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,801
- Joking.
- Serious.

562
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,972
This gonna shut you up?

563
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,685
Tell me what this stuff does, again.

564
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,732
STEP: Yeah, I just believe
what's right is right.

565
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,150
CINDY: That's right, Step.

566
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,278
And what's right is
for you to send a message

567
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:45,908
so that a horrible accident like this
never happens to anybody ever again.

568
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,452
That's why I got a lawyer for you.

569
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,871
You want to know who?

570
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,124
- Who?
- The guy on all the bus-stop benches.

571
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,752
- Joe Adler? You got me Joe Adler?
- Mmm-hmm.

572
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,045
Yeah.

573
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,881
You're so good to me, Cindy.

574
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,305
Okay. Oh, my gosh. Step, I'm sorry.

575
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,307
You're getting me aroused,

576
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,059
and I'm getting you aroused,

577
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,645
and your doctor said
that you should not get aroused

578
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,563
till after the trial.

579
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,816
Step, I'm so sorry.

580
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,611
I'm sorry. I think we should go.
I'm sorry.

581
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,660
STEP: Man. Look at all them mallards.

582
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,579
I knew I should have brought
the Mossberg.

583
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,957
DEAN: Shit.

584
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,793
Do you remember what color
that pill was I gave you?

585
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,087
- What?
- Damn it.

586
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,339
I don't think it was Xanax.

587
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,884
Could have been Ritalin or Special K.

588
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,763
I don't care. What?

589
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,475
Well, Special K is a horse tranquilizer.

590
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,019
It sometimes has weird effects
on humans.

591
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,521
Hey, it's nothing to worry about.

592
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,274
Probably just shouldn't drink anymore.

593
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,317
Remember that thing
you were talking about?

594
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,528
- About the gigolo?
- Yeah?

595
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,655
You don't think that is wrong?

596
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,407
You don't think that
that is morally wrong?

597
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,950
What could be morally wrong
about that?

598
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,618
Yeah, I don't know.

599
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:15,163
Look, man.
If she doesn't wanna do anything,

600
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,165
she doesn't have to, okay?

601
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,544
But if she does,
then she's the one who sinned,

602
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,920
and you're the one
who can go out there

603
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,381
and drop the Joel-pole
in whoever the hell you want to.

604
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,008
And that's what's morally appropriate.

605
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:30,053
I cannot... I can't see anything
morally wrong with it, either,

606
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,347
and... And he's a friend of yours, right?
What is his name?

607
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,640
Brad. You want me
to get on the phone with him?

608
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,058
No, no. Just hang on.

609
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,978
It's very weird
to even talk about this, Dean.

610
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:43,317
Dude, all you got to do is tell her
he's coming to be the new pool guy

611
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,778
or whatever, and see what happens.
Seriously.

612
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,407
If she doesn't go for it, terrific.

613
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,702
Now you just feel better for not
fooling around in the first place.

614
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:57,247
I think you're right,
and we do need a new pool cleaner.

615
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,749
That's a sign, bro.

616
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,835
Yeah, I just... I don't know. It's so nuts.

617
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,213
You got to listen to the universe.

618
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,633
Why don't you have
another drink, man?

619
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,885
You know what?
Why don't I go call Brad?

620
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,095
See what he has to say about this?

621
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,722
What the hell.

622
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:20,312
It seems pretty clear, right?
I mean, it's $200, right?

623
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,980
Yeah. It's 200.

624
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,943
Well, yeah. I mean, you know,
I'm getting my 10%.

625
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,070
Come on, Dean. What are you?
You're a pimp now?

626
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:31,198
I don't think they call it a pimp
when it's with a male prostitute, Joel.

627
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,700
- All right.
- DEAN: They have another name for it.

628
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,662
It's not a john,
but it's something like that.

629
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,372
They call it something else.

630
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,706
Look, I'm the one
who hooked this whole thing up.

631
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,791
- I get it.
- DEAN: Okay?

632
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,292
You have nothing to worry about
'cause it all comes out...

633
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,669
...of his money, anyway.
- All right!

634
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,671
- Fine.
- So, it's $200.

635
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,214
Yep. 220.

636
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,007
- Dean!
- What?

637
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,842
I have a question.

638
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,386
Yep.

639
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,140
So, are you, like,
gonna watch or something?

640
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,479
No, no. No, no. No, I'm...
I'm not even gonna be there.

641
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:05,148
I'm gonna be at work.
Don't you remember? We covered this.

642
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,402
- Didn't we cover this?
- Look, dude, here's the story.

643
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,362
What you're gonna do is,

644
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,198
you're just gonna go
to Joel's house, okay,

645
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,492
pretending to be the new pool cleaner.

646
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:19,705
When you get there, you will simply
attempt to seduce Joel's wife.

647
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,498
If she does not respond,

648
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,667
you will simply
clean the pool and leave.

649
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,711
That's it. It's just that simple.

650
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:32,426
So you're not gonna, like,
try to touch my ass or anything?

651
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,767
Listen. He will be at work.

652
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:44,938
You will go by when he is not there,

653
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:49,401
and you will pose as the pool cleaner

654
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,070
trying to seduce the wife.

655
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,740
(LAUGHING)

656
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,658
I see. Yeah. I get it now.

657
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,118
- It's so simple.
- BRAD: Yeah. I'm sorry. Cool.

658
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,661
Yeah. You're not even gonna be there.

659
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,538
DEAN: No, he will not be there.

660
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,249
He will not be at the house.
You will be at the house.

661
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,293
The wife will be at the house. He will...

662
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,378
- BRAD: Not be...
- Not be at the house.

663
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,882
Cool. No problem.
This is gonna be great.

664
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,843
Now, I want you to remember
that she might not go for it.

665
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,054
So, awesome, yeah.
No, I can hardly wait.

666
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,972
- She might not go for it.
- This is going to be awesome.

667
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,684
Awesome. Hey, man,
if you know of anybody else

668
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:27,564
who might need, you know, what I do,
like lonely housewives and shit,

669
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,815
you think you could tell them
about me?

670
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,234
Because I figure
if I can get enough of them,

671
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,779
then maybe I could quit
my landscaping job.

672
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:37,074
That would be awesome,
because I hate landscaping, dude,

673
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,367
and I like getting laid a lot better.

674
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,662
And I'm always seeing all kinds of
horny housewives out at the clubs,

675
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,873
so, like I say,
if your wife has any housewife...

676
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:48,126
Brad, you're killing me, man.
All right? Good talking to you.

677
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,213
- All right.
- Good talking, all right, bro? Later.

678
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,506
BRAD: Oh? You know what else
I was thinking, man?

679
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,092
- Later on, Brad. Good night, man.
- BRAD: All right, cool.

680
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:58,595
Hey, let me give you a ride home.
You're not in any condition to drive.

681
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,930
I know.

682
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,642
This... Are you sure about this guy?
This...

683
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,228
DEAN: Oh, yeah, man. He's real cool.

684
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,563
He just gets a little fired up
before each job.

685
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,316
It's just... He doesn't seem that bright.

686
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,737
I mean, what do you expect?
He's a whore.

687
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,467
CINDY: Hey.

688
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:41,388
Wow, looks like you had
one of those nights, huh?

689
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,015
So, where was I?

690
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,983
Oh, shit.

691
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,652
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

692
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,320
- Hello?
- Hey, Dean.

693
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,656
- Joel.
- Thank God you're awake.

694
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,159
Did that really happen last night?

695
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,412
We go through with that?
That gigolo stuff?

696
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,872
As far as I know.

697
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,583
- God damn it!
- What?

698
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,836
What was I thinking?
We got to call that off right now.

699
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,589
Can you call that guy?
What's his name?

700
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,633
Brad. Okay. Yeah, man. I'll call him.

701
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,927
Yeah, tell him I'll pay him anyway.
Not to... Not to worry about it.

702
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,429
Just tell him not to go over there.

703
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,514
What was I thinking?

704
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,017
All right, chill. Chill. I'll call him.

705
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,269
Thanks for the drugs, Dean.

706
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:35,650
Actually, I don't have his digits.

707
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,986
What're you talking about?
Thought you called him last night.

708
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,698
- Yeah, but I got his number from Cliff.
- You get it from Cliff again.

709
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:45,202
Cliff doesn't have a phone right now.
I got it from him at the bar.

710
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,953
Motherfucker!

711
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,834
What's the boy's last name?
I'll call information.

712
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,253
I don't remember. It's a Mexican name.

713
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,421
Mexican?

714
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,589
For Christ's sake, Dean,

715
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,549
the guy's got blonde hair
and blue eyes. Come on.

716
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,052
I thought it was strange, too,
a guy who looks like that

717
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,138
had a Mexican last name,
but I don't judge people, you know?

718
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,558
I mean, might not have been Mexican.
Could have been a Filipino name.

719
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:12,145
I think it's Lopez or Sanchez.

720
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,606
Or Gutiérrez.

721
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,484
Shit. I got to get home
and head him off.

722
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,819
- Joel, we got to talk.
- Not now, Brian.

723
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,904
- It's kind of important.
- Not now, pal.

724
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:21,947
- Not now.
- It's kind of really important.

725
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,198
- It's about Step.
- JENNY: There's a Brad Chavez

726
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,033
on Line 1 for you.

727
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,704
- Who?
- Brad Chavez.

728
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,748
Brad Chavez?

729
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,333
You want me to take a message?

730
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:37,295
No, no. That's the pool cleaner.
I better take that.

731
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,298
Hello?

732
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,259
- Hey, is this Joel?
- Yes, it is.

733
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,469
- Hey, man. It's Brad.
- Hey. Thank God.

734
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,012
Mission accomplished, dude.

735
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,682
It worked. She totally went for it.

736
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:53,645
You were not even supposed
to be there for another 45 minutes.

737
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,189
Oh, really? Yeah.

738
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,109
I totally forgot what time
you guys told me,

739
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,654
and I was so excited about it
I just went over there.

740
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,365
Um...

741
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:10,370
So, then, you... She actually...
You guys...

742
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,163
Yep. It was easy.

743
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,542
Easy? What does that mean, easy?

744
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,130
No, I don't mean easy like
she was easy or anything like,

745
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,424
"Your wife's a slut," or anything.

746
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,385
I just meant it wasn't hard
to get her to...

747
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,470
Never mind.

748
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,432
Tell me. Tell me what happened.
I want to hear it all.

749
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,684
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

750
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:37,105
Okay. Well, she let me in,

751
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,816
so I just went back
like I was cleaning the pool,

752
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,527
and I don't know anything
about pool cleaning, right?

753
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,030
So, I was totally just faking it,

754
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:47,073
and she was in her bathing suit,

755
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,743
so I struck up a conversation.

756
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,329
This is a really nice house.

757
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,788
Thank you.

758
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,166
Is it your dad's house?

759
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,335
No, it's... It's ours.

760
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,254
Oh. Wow.

761
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:05,633
You look so young
to be living in a house this nice.

762
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,718
(GIGGLING)

763
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,136
What?

764
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:12,932
Do you have any sunscreen?
I forgot mine.

765
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,226
Sure.

766
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,145
BRAD: And, see, I thought that was
pretty smart of me, right,

767
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,855
to ask to borrow the sunscreen,

768
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:22,442
because that way I could ask
if she wanted some

769
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,527
and I could rub some
on her back, right?

770
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,863
Instead of me just coming out
and asking to rub some on her back.

771
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,491
It was pretty smooth, huh?

772
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:34,079
Anyway, once I started rubbing lotion
all over her body...

773
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,373
...the rest was pretty easy. She...
- All right! That's it!

774
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,416
Stop it! I don't need to hear any more.

775
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,210
Okay. Okay, dude.

776
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:44,089
Well, hey, listen,
if you have anyone else that

777
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:47,509
you want to referral me to

778
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:50,678
or, like, if you want me to do
your wife again, I can...

779
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,014
No! I've got to go. Goodbye.

780
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,564
- Oh! Damn it!
- Yoo-hoo. Hey!

781
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,654
- How's it going?
- I'm real busy, actually.

782
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,906
Well, I'm not gonna keep you long.

783
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,867
I went ahead
and got those tickets for that dinner

784
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,954
we talked about going to together
on the seventh.

785
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,665
I think I mentioned
that they were 40 apiece.

786
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:22,544
Well, as it turns out,
they're a tad more this year. 55.

787
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,504
I told you that we really
didn't want to go to that thing.

788
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,588
Don't you remember that?

789
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,258
I know you said something
about Suzie feeling uncomfortable,

790
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:31,386
but like I say,
she won't feel uncomfortable at all.

791
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,139
She could wear a pantsuit,
if that's the issue.

792
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:37,350
- It's not formal or anything.
- No. It's not the problem, Nathan.

793
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,603
What? Does she not like
to wear a dress ever?

794
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,188
I gotta go.

795
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,358
One more thing! I'm busy, too.

796
00:40:55,911 --> 00:41:00,165
Joel, I was thinking,
maybe we could go on vacation,

797
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,000
just the two of us.

798
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,377
We haven't done something like that
in a long time,

799
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,589
and I know they have really
great deals right now in the Caribbean.

800
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,549
I hate the Caribbean.

801
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,634
Really? Why?

802
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,386
'Cause it sucks.

803
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,974
But I thought you liked
going to hot places,

804
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:20,477
you know, so you can wear your shorts.

805
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,563
I don't feel so good.
I'm gonna go to bed.

806
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:26,399
Is it the food?

807
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:47,003
Well, actually, I'm in, like,
five bands right now,

808
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:50,340
but God's Cock is basically
the same four guys as Fight Head,

809
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:53,426
but Fight Head's more of, like,
a thrash skate-punk-type thing,

810
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,846
whereas God's Cock is more like
melodic grindcore.

811
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,391
So, it's five bands,
but it's four groups of guys.

812
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:05,230
She is so nice.
I wish they'd hire more people like her.

813
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,564
Mmm-hmm.

814
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:09,859
Can't believe he's still working here.

815
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,195
Did you know
that Sylvia's wallet is missing?

816
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,863
She thinks it was stolen.

817
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,907
And guess who was
in the locker room last?

818
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,367
Hector.

819
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,537
Hey. Did you guys hear the rumor?

820
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,288
Jim said Joel and Brian
are going to sell the company.

821
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,040
Rich said the same thing, too.

822
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:27,043
He said they'll probably make millions
and billions of dollars, too.

823
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,711
Shut the fuck up.

824
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:29,796
You mean, I'm working my ass off

825
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,506
and those guys are gonna make
all that money?

826
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,383
I work harder than anybody.

827
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:37,220
If you add it all up,
I lift over 200,000 pounds a week.

828
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,513
We should do something.

829
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:39,931
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

830
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:42,976
Here. Ladies are free,
so bring some chicks.

831
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,602
GABRIELLA: Mmm-hmm.

832
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,272
- You got a sec?
- Yeah.

833
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,023
I think we might have
a really big problem here.

834
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,400
I don't know what happened,
but all of a sudden,

835
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,569
Step says he doesn't want
to settle anymore.

836
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,529
I think he might have talked to a lawyer.

837
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,240
Like I say, the General Mills guys
don't wanna make the offer official

838
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,033
until this whole thing is settled, so...

839
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,536
All right, well, don't worry about it.

840
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,413
Step's probably just chest-beating,
you know?

841
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,540
He does this all the time.
He gets all wound up, talks big,

842
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,083
and then he usually backs down.

843
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,294
And that was with his balls, so,

844
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,547
- I'll talk to him.
- Okay. All right. The sooner the better.

845
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,343
(NATHAN EXCLAIMS)

846
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,137
There he is. Hey.

847
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,181
I can't talk today.

848
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,101
- Almost missed you.
- I can't talk right now, Nathan.

849
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,437
Hey, I noticed you got
a new pool cleaner today.

850
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,688
How is he?

851
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,481
We're thinking about
changing services.

852
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:34,444
I got to get inside...
Hang on, you mean yesterday, right?

853
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,154
- Huh?
- The pool cleaner that you saw,

854
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,364
you saw him yesterday,
not today, right?

855
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,450
No, today. The new guy.

856
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,537
What did he look like?

857
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,332
Well, you know,
blonde-haired kid about yea high.

858
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,959
Good-looking kid. Real good-looking.

859
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,294
In fact, Leslie even commented...

860
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,463
You're absolutely sure
that you saw him today,

861
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,881
and not yesterday?

862
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,341
- Yeah.
- No doubt?

863
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,469
No, no doubt about it. It was today.
I came home for lunch.

864
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,221
Yesterday, I had this bear of
a sales conference.

865
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,307
This guy just went on.

866
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,977
Hey, do you think I could go ahead
and get that check from you?

867
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,229
It's 110...

868
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,607
All right, I'll call you!

869
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,361
BRAD: Hello?

870
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,904
- Yeah, is this Brad?
- Yeah.

871
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,405
What were you doing
at my house today?

872
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,033
Oh!

873
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,579
- Nothing.
- Bullshit.

874
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,582
Look, don't worry about it, dude.

875
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,417
I won't charge you for this one.

876
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,503
You had sex with my wife again?

877
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:38,341
Well, I figured we already did it once,
so what's the big deal, right?

878
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:41,678
- Besides, I'm not going to charge you.
- You're not going to charge...

879
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,513
You are going to charge me
and I am going to pay you,

880
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:46,224
because you are not going to have sex
with my wife for free, all right?

881
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:50,019
Now, listen. If I ever catch you
anywhere near my house ever again,

882
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,397
it's not going to be great, all right?

883
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:56,109
Okay, listen, if you know
of anyone else who needs...

Hey, do you want to,

885
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,951
I don't know, go out or something?

886
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,370
We can go to 7-Eleven
and get pizza sticks.

I thought you said
it wouldn't bother you.

Well, I guess
I didn't think about it long enough.

It was so easy for him, too.
I can't stand that.

or should I go to you, or...

919
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,502
Don't even worry about that right now.

920
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,337
We can deal
with the economics of it later.

921
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,714
You can just table that.
That's not what's important.

922
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,467
What's important is that
you should be going out right now

923
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,554
and calling Cindy, guilt-free.
Conscience clear.

924
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:32,056
Yeah. I don't know about that.
She's at that party.

925
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,851
- Look. You know what you need to do?
- I don't need any more drugs.

926
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:38,896
Dude. I know I kid around a lot
and I'm a little bit of a character,

927
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:42,191
but I'm serious right now.
This is real advice.

928
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,277
Okay? So, I want you to listen to me.

929
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,738
You should try smoking a little pot.

930
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,076
- That's a drug.
- It's not a drug. It's a flower.

931
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:56,414
It has healing properties.
Stress is a killer.

932
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,249
Okay, I get paranoid when I smoke pot.

933
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,835
Not if you smoke a little, bro.

934
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,545
You know what you need to do?

935
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,088
You need to hang out
with my boy Willie.

936
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:07,967
He's a great guy. He's the one
who gave me that horse tranquilizer.

937
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:16,767
Dude, the Atlantians gave mankind
the secret 10,000 years ago.

938
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,771
See, drugs don't give you a hangover,
man. You know what I mean?

939
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:25,610
People are just now starting to use
that shit. Embrace it.

940
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,404
That's how we're going to solve
modern problems, man.

941
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:32,617
Wisdom of the ancients.
Ask Willie, bro. He's a shaman.

942
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,994
Right on.

943
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,054
- All right, man.
- No.

944
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:56,140
I'm really kind of a lightweight. If you've
got a beer, or even some wine...

945
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,642
- It's not really my thing.
- Bullshit.

946
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:00,478
Come on, Joel.
Man, he thinks he gets paranoid.

947
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:02,480
- I do get paranoid.
- Okay.

948
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,107
You familiar with the Graffix bong?

949
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,984
- You ever used one before?
- No.

950
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,528
Okay. Put your thumb right here.

951
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,865
Hey! You put your right thumb here,
on the carburetor.

952
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:19,080
Now, when I tell you to let go,
I want you to let go and inhale hard.

953
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,123
Okay. Exhale!

954
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,584
- I'm going to let you guys do this.
- Bullshit!

955
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,835
This doesn't work for me.
Just give mine to Dean.

956
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,837
- Exhale hard!
- I get paranoid, so I don't...

957
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,464
Exhale!

958
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,882
(EXHALES)

959
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:32,051
Put your lips on it. Yeah.

960
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:38,140
Go! Inhale! Go! Go! Harder!

961
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,600
(BUBBLING)

962
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,268
Let go!

963
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,645
Inhale!

964
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,734
Yeah.

965
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,861
(COUGHING)

966
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,156
Oh, yeah.

(WILLIE CHUCKLING)

968
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:03,249
Yeah. It's Jesus. You see him?

969
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,681
JOEL: Oh, fuck.

970
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:33,779
Huh?

971
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,241
I thought I heard somebody
say something.

972
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:38,909
(CLEARS THROAT)

973

(SCREAMING)

974
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,544
JOEL: Jesus Christ.

975
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,796
Did you see the look on his face?

976
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,050
Man, you do get paranoid
when you get stoned.

977
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,384
You do, dude.

978
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,219
Did you get paranoid
when he jumped at you?

979
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,554
I told you guys.

980
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,682
Hey, dude, man.
You should call that girl now.

981
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:02,767
Well, yeah, what time is it?

982
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:06,228
Time for you to call her
and finally get laid, man. Come on!

983
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,855
- All right.
- DEAN: It's 12:30, man.

984
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,732
She's probably at home now.

985
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,278
What does she look like?

986
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:19,658
She's... She has dark hair.
She's kind of pretty,

987
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,828
and, you know, working-class looking.

988
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:26,957
What do you mean by that?

989
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,759
That she's kind of slutty-looking?

990
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,433
Kind of. Yeah.

991
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,064
That's how I like them.

992
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,900
Kind of nasty. Yeah.

993
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,778
You guys have the same taste, man.

994
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,532
Yeah. Hope I don't wake her up.

995

(BUSY SIGNAL BEEPING)

996

Busy.

At least you know she's home, man.

998
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,249
I don't know what kind of person
doesn't have call waiting.

999
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,335
I don't have call waiting.

1000
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:17,091
I hate call waiting.

1001
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,094

(IMITATES CLICKING)

1003
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:25,599
I put my fist
right through someone's skull!

1004
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,861
Are you joking? He's playing with you.

1005
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:41,365
You do get paranoid
when you are stoned, huh?

1006
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:47,329
Seriously, though, I hate call waiting.

1007
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,622
Okay, man.

1008
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,835
You're too stoned.
I'm gonna dial the number for you.

1009
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:06,932
I'll tell you
why you're getting a busy signal.

1010
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,813
This is my number.

1011
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:22,531
Enough. I don't know why
you're trying to get me so paranoid.

1012
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,949
You're gonna make me cry.

1013
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:25,910
Hey.

1014

00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,498
Hey. What are you doing here?

1016
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:36,754
Joel, man, I'm not proud of you today.

1017
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:37,880
Guys, seems like...

1018
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,715
...you guys will have a lot to work out.
- Hey, man.

1019
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,717
I don't want to be a fourth wheel.

1020

Oh, my God. Joel, are you all right?
What happened?

1026
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:21,840
I'm fine. I'm fine. Just got
my ass kicked. Just back to sleep.

- Honey, just...

want to go to sleep right now. Shh!

- I'm set.

00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:04,925
Not returning my calls.

1041
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:09,013
Oh, shit. We got trouble.
He did talk to a lawyer.

1042

you see on all the bus-stop bench ads.

Yeah. I mean,
this could be a real problem.

1048
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,699
We could be really screwed here.

- Yeah.

- Our Step?
- I know. Weird.

1055
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,050
And they didn't even meet here.

1056

They met, like, at some grocery store
or something, totally random.

little dingle berry like him

ends up with a girl like Cindy

And if it's okay with you,
I'd like to go ahead and fire Hector.

00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,494
Same thing that's...

1073
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,789
Your face is going to look like
my face if I ever...

1074
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:03,669
Actually, your face is going to
look worse than mine if...

1075
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:09,425
Listen, if I ever catch you anywhere
near my house or my wife again,

1076
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:12,052
at the very least, you will be arrested.

1077
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:16,056
For what? Suzie let me in.

1078
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:23,689
Listen, man, I know she's your wife
and shit and whatever.

1079
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:27,985
You might as well know,
I think we're in love.

Stupid Brad. Stupid, dumb, dumb Brad.

1083
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:41,999
You think that she is in love with you?
You don't even know her, okay?

1084
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:45,461
You're nothing but a little piece of ass.
That's it.

1085
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,464
I don't think so, dude.

1086
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,549
You don't think so, dude?
Did you ever think

1087
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,634
that she doesn't even know
that I paid you to have sex with her?

1088
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:53,802
Did you ever think about that?

1089
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,929
Did that ever skitter across
your little tiny brain?

1090
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,431
How about I go home
and I tell her right now

1091
00:57:57,515 --> 00:58:00,350
that you did it all for money?
What about that, ding-ding?

1092
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,477
Shut up. You wouldn't do that.

1093

- Really? Watch this, slut.
- No!

1094
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:06,440
- Here I go.
- No, wait! Please!

1095
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,859
Don't! Man!

1096
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:15,073
Listen, man, me and your wife
got something really special going on.

1097
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,992
Please don't mess it up for me.

1098
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:20,412
Don't mess it up?
You're talking about my wife!

1099
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:23,457
My house! My pool! Stupid ass.

1100
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:26,043
No, wait! Come on!
You can't do this to me!

1101
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,586
Oh, yes, I can!

1102
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,218
SUZIE: Hi. You're home early.

1103
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,303
So, how was that new pool cleaner?

1104
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,721
What do you mean?

1105
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,473
What do you think I mean?

1106
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,395
Did he do a good job cleaning the pool?

1107
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:48,524
Well, I...

1108
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,693
Did he get all the leaves?
'Cause it doesn't look really clean.

1109
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:55,531
I'm looking right at it,
and it looks pretty goddamn filthy.

1110
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:59,243
Yeah, yeah.
It doesn't look like he did a good job.

1111
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,661
I think he did a horrible job,

1112
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:03,413
and I don't think
we're going to be using him anymore.

1113
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,831
- Okay.
- Okay?

1114
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,377
Are you sure you're feeling okay, Joel?
Can I take you to the doctor?

1115
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:09,503
Nope!

1116
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:11,755
- Do you want some aspirin?
- No, thank you!

1117
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:12,923
How about some raisins?

Yes, sir. She's my girlfriend.

1129
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,348
We might even get married after all this
lawsuit settlement stuff gets settled.

1130
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:05,058
Huh.

1131

Step, you might want to be
careful with her.

What do you mean?
Does she got an STD?

I just... Step, I'm not sure
how to put this,

1134
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,197
but, you know,
you have got a lot of money

1135
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:23,035
coming your way from the settlement.
You might want to be careful with her.

her problems, but she means well.

She's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

Step, I don't want to tell you what to do,

1139
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,549
but I just want you
to think about this, you know.

1140
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:41,553
If you go beyond the settlement,
you continue with the lawsuit,

1141
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,472
you could bankrupt that company.

- We have to stop doing this.
- Why?

1150
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:05,118
Because it's not right,
and I feel horrible,

1151
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,829
and you have to start cleaning the pool.

I don't know what got into me.

1157
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:36,024
I was bored and frustrated,
and I was not feeling particularly pretty.

- It's today, remember? Now.
- Shit.

I should fire all three of you

But this Step guy? He's the Holy Grail.

1180
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:48,638
You see, if both his balls
had been knocked clean off,

1181
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:51,641
he'd be a good case,
but not a great case.

1182
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:54,603
A man with no balls is no man at all.

they can walk in the shoes

But Step? He's got one ball, barely.

1186
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:11,369
To a jury he's still a man, and that
manhood is hanging on by a thread.

- How are you?
- Hi.

You see those guys up there?

1193
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,094
I heard those are the guys
from General Mills.

1194
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:31,056
Look, if they're gonna sell this place
and cash out and leave me with no job,

1195
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,849
then I should get some
of that cash, man.

1196
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,059
I mean, it's only fair.

1197
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,102
I've been working here for,
like, two years.

1198
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,772
It's bullshit, man. I work my ass off.

1199
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,149
Remember, Hector, I was telling you
how hard I worked my ass off?

1200
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:45,278
I've been working here 14 years.
We can get jobs at GemCo like that.

1201
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,656
And at GemCo,
all the employees are owners.

1202
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,491
It even says so on the nametags.

1203
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:51,451
But the thing is,
I don't want to work at GemCo.

1204
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,036
GemCo sucks, man.

1205
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,205
They make you do calisthenics. Yeah.

1206
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:58,166
That's right.
We could work at Southwest Airlines.

1207
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,126
But I don't want to work
at Southwest, either.

1208
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,087
They make you do the limbo.

1209
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,505
That is messed up.

1210
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,174
Yeah, I would be the laughingstock
of the grindcore community.

1211
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,134
If we quit, this place couldn't run.

1212
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,679
They wouldn't be able to sell this place
for anything.

1213
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:15,183
Well, that's why what we should do is,
is we should all go on strike,

1214
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:18,520
demand stock in the company
before it sells.

1215
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,647
If General Mills knew
that we were on strike,

1216
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:23,942
they would not buy this place
until that strike was over.

1217
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:28,154
See, that way, Joel and Brian
would have to give us stock.

1218
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:33,368
Yeah. We should do it.
We should strike.

1219
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:35,453
That's what I've been saying
this whole time.

1220
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,206
We've gone through everything,

1221

we should get a piece of it.

01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:08,341
you can tell them that I stole it.
All right?

1370
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,219
On second thought,
I'm gonna call them right now

1371
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:13,304
and I'm gonna tell them
that you stole it.

1372
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:18,810
- Joel, please don't.
- Why?

1373
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,729
Joel, please don't call the police.
I'm on probation,

1374
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,065
and I will go to jail
for a really long time.

1375
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:25,233
Well, maybe you should have
thought about that

1376
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:27,110
before you started
ripping off my employees.

1377
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:29,529
Joel, please? Listen, I promise you

1378
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:31,823
I will leave Step alone
and he will drop the lawsuit.

1379
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,241
How do I know that?

1380
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:35,451
You can keep the bag.

1381
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:38,746
If I don't leave Step alone,
if he doesn't drop the lawsuit,

1382
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,665
then you can turn me in.

1383
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:48,423
Yeah, that...
And Sylvia's wallet and Jim's watch?

1384
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:50,425
You got those? Can I have those, too?

1385
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:59,559
I guess that works. I mean, great.

1386
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:04,063
I bet you weren't even
into food flavoring, were you?

1387
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:05,398
Mmm-mmm.

1388
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:08,734
What is your deal?
How do you end up like this?

1389
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:10,611
(SOBBING)

1390
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,155
Hey?

1391
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:14,991
Hey? This is what I'm talking about.

1392
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:18,244
This manipulation here with the tears.
I'm not gonna fall for that.

1393
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:19,454
Forget it.

1394
01:14:20,664 --> 01:14:24,375
You better not be faking it, okay,
because I'm actually feeling bad.

1395
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:26,085
Hello?

1396
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,215
Are you faking it?

1397
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:40,099
Well, I'm sorry. You know, I just...
You know, I just...

1398
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,811
I was just curious about
how somebody ends up like this.

1399
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,271
All right. Just...

1400
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:48,274
(SHUSHING)

1401
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:52,820
Very sorry. Okay? Don't worry about it.

1402
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:57,492
I just thought I'd just ask how a...

1403
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:23,518
Cindy? Cindy?

1404
01:15:25,562 --> 01:15:26,687
Shit.

1405
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:50,127
(SINGING) Who were you thinking of
when we were making love last night?

1406
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:56,676
Was it a good-looking stranger
or a close friend of mine?

1407
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:05,309
You didn't want to quit
when we was into it last night

1408
01:16:08,772 --> 01:16:11,649
Joel hasn't been in all morning.
Can you believe that?

1409
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:14,277
If we come in late, we get in trouble.

1410
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:15,444
Mmm-hmm.

1411
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:17,280
(GASPS)

1412
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:21,075
And Hector didn't steal it. Cindy did.

1413
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:25,288
Can you believe that?

1414
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:28,624
Blaming Cindy just to protect Hector.
Typical.

1415
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:37,800
We really do need to go
to the grocery store, Step.

1416
01:16:41,054 --> 01:16:42,722
You heard from Cindy lately?

1417
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:45,808
It's been over three days
since she borrowed your truck.

1418
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:48,561
Maybe we ought to call the cops
or something...

1419
01:16:48,645 --> 01:16:52,398
Look, she'll be back, all right?
She wouldn't steal my truck.

1420
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:53,608
Okay.

1421
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,947
That's the last bottle of Pepsi.

1422
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:03,868
Maybe I'll just call Domino's
and have them deliver some Pepsi.

1423
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:09,457
Still, if she didn't steal your truck

1424
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:12,543
and she didn't get into an accident,
what do you reckon...

1425
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:16,005
Shut up about Cindy, already,
before I kick your fat ass!

1426
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:20,426
WOMAN: Domino's.
Hello, Mr. Wilkinson.

1427
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:21,510
Hello.

1428
01:17:25,891 --> 01:17:26,891
- BRIAN: Hey.
- Hey, Brian.

1429
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,309
Step's here to see you.

1430
01:17:29,686 --> 01:17:32,355
Is he? Great. Bring him in.

1431
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:34,690
He's outside at the loading dock.

1432
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:39,362
He wants to talk to you alone out there
for some reason. You know?

1433
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:40,780
Man to man.

1434
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:47,912
I'm sick and tired of dealing
with that Adler fellow.

1435
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:53,084
Truth is, I just want my old life back.
I just wanna get back to work.

1436
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:57,505
You know? I'm a working man.
That's what I do.

1437
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:01,509
The problem is,
if I bankrupt the company,

1438
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:04,762
there won't be a job for me
to go back to.

1439
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:07,765
You don't have to bankrupt
the company.

1440
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:11,519
Well, if I drop the lawsuit,
you'll sell the company,

1441
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:16,190
and the new company, well, who'd
want to hire somebody with one ball?

1442
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:22,113
Well, you know, listen, I don't think
they're actually allowed to ask,

1443
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:23,739
so you're okay.

1444
01:18:26,076 --> 01:18:28,202
You know, I'm a working man, too,
Step. You know?

1445
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:32,581
I make extract. That's what I do.
You know? Vanilla.

1446
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:37,461
Cherry. Root beer. S'mores.

1447
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:40,715
And a lot of people don't think that
that's very cool,

1448
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:43,968
but I think that it is pretty cool, so,

1449
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:47,805
why would I want to sell this place?

1450
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:52,810
I think that I just got distracted
with Dean and the drugs

1451
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:55,688
and the gigolos and...

1452
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:02,319
You know, what I'm saying is
that I'm thinking about maybe

1453
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,155
not selling the company.

1454
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:07,408
That is, if there isn't a lawsuit.

1455
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:10,327
There is going to be
that insurance money, Step,

1456
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:12,079
so what do you think?

1457
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,665
Yeah, that sounds fair to me.

1458
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,461
But under one condition.

1459
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,005
What's that?

1460
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:23,507
You make me floor manager.

Thank you.

1465
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,687
Okay.

Everybody gather around! Listen up!

1467
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:50,785
Okay. First of all, I want to say that
I've decided not to sell the company.

1468
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:53,037
All right?

1469
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:57,958
And, secondly, I'm making Step here
the new floor manager.

1470
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:01,712
Anybody doesn't like that,
I hear they're hiring over at GemCo.

1471
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:05,257
Remember, though, at GemCo,
the owner doesn't know your names.

1472
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:06,634
You'll probably never even meet him.

1473
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:09,512
He's, like,
in some corporate office somewhere.

1474
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,555
Here, you know, I'm just upstairs.

1475
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,517
You can come up there and you can
tell me if you got a problem, okay?

1476
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:16,101
That's all. Okay?

1477
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,312
Step, the floor is yours.

Look, I know you probably
want to kick my ass.

I just wanted to tell you that
I'm not gonna see Suzie anymore,

01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:10,114
so you don't have to worry.

She's really into you, dude.

1492

I guess that's why
she married you and shit.

1493
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:17,746
Whatever.

1494
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:21,792
You're a really lucky guy,
and I'm sorry if I messed shit up.

1495
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,586
Why'd you have to get hung up
on Suzie?

01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:25,212
You could have any girl you want.

01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:29,174
Yeah, but I want Suzie.
I can't have her.

1498
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:31,093
You had her 15 times.

1499
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,470
Well, yeah.

1500
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,392
But she doesn't love me, dude.
It's just not the same.

- Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that.
- All right. You told me.

1502
01:21:43,523 --> 01:21:45,274
All right. Later.

1503
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:58,287
Hey, so, I was wondering,
I quit my landscaping job,

1504
01:21:58,371 --> 01:22:02,207
and I don't really think I'm cut out
for the whole gigolo thing.

1505
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:07,546
You know? So, do you think
you might have, like, an opening

1506
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:10,591
or whatever at the extract plant?

1507
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:12,676
I'm not going to give you a job. Okay?

1508
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:15,262
Yeah. Sorry.

1509
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:25,439
Or just come by the office
and fill out an application.

1510
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:27,191
I'll see what I can do, okay?

1511
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:29,777
Cool. Thanks, man.

You know, I'm starting to think
this might have been a mistake.

- Really?
- Maybe it was my fault, you know?

1516
01:22:44,584 --> 01:22:46,335
- Maybe it was your fault.
- No, it's yours.

1517
01:22:46,419 --> 01:22:48,504
A lot of blame to go around here.

1518
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:52,925
I think there are some people
who just aren't meant to do drugs, Joel.

1519
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:56,178
I think you're one of those people, man.

Shit.

1522
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:10,901
Why are you cleaning
the pool yourself?

1523
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:12,695
New guy didn't work out?

1524
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:14,571
Yeah, no, didn't work out.

1525
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:18,242
Boy, it's just hard
to get good help, huh?

1526
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:19,451
Yeah.

1527
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:21,578
(CHUCKLES)

1528
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:25,416
Hey. Did you get a chance
to write that check?

1529
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:30,170
Nathan, Joel and I are not going
to that dinner. Okay?

1530
01:23:31,214 --> 01:23:34,133
Gee, I wish you would have told me that
before I went and bought those tickets.

1531
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:36,760
Joel never agreed to it,
and neither did I.

1532
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:41,056
Well, it sure sounded like
you guys were coming.

1533
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:43,183
I mean, Leslie was going
to talk to you about it,

1534
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:45,102
but you don't return our calls.

1535
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:49,023
I mean, I already bought those tickets,
and they're non-refundable.

1536
01:23:49,941 --> 01:23:52,860
I really wish you guys had been
a little more clear with me.

1537
01:23:54,946 --> 01:23:57,239
Well, then,
let me be clear with you now.

1538
01:23:58,074 --> 01:24:01,744
When we say things like,
"I don't think so,"

1539
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:03,537
or "I'm not sure,"

1540
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:08,208
or we close the door in your face,
that means, "No."

1541
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:09,793
Why can't you get that?

1542
01:24:10,336 --> 01:24:12,379
- Well, it...
- Shut up! Okay.

1543
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:16,008
Let me be even more clear
with you, Nathan.

1544
01:24:16,092 --> 01:24:18,135
We don't like you.

1545
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:20,637
Is that clear enough for you?

1546
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:24,433
You're dull. You talk too much.
You never listen.

1547
01:24:24,517 --> 01:24:26,060
You're always in our yard.

1548
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:28,562
I don't know what the hell
you're barbecuing over there,

1549
01:24:28,646 --> 01:24:30,189
but it stinks.

1550
01:24:30,273 --> 01:24:34,026
You lay out in your front yard
and listen to your car radio!

1551
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:37,404
You are the worst neighbor
in the world.

1552
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:41,158
We don't like you. Is that clear enough
for you, Nathan? Is that clear?

1553
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,534
Shut up!

1554
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:44,078
Nathan?

1555
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,498
Nathan? Nathan?

1556
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:50,334
(CHURCH ORGAN PLAYING)

1557
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:15,901
(CHATTERING)

1558
01:25:19,864 --> 01:25:21,198
- Hi.
- Hi.

1559
01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:25,035
Are you okay?

1560
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:29,957
I think I might have killed him, Joel.

1561
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:33,127
The last thing he heard was me
yelling at him to shut up.

1562
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:36,004
Well, he did talk a lot.

1563
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:40,134
Yeah. He was going on and on.
I finally lost it.

1564
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:43,262
I'm sure it wasn't your fault.
Probably just a coincidence, you know.

1565
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:46,056
I don't know. I just...
I still feel really guilty about it.

1566
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:50,727
I actually told Leslie I would go
to that Rotary Club dinner tonight.

1567
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:54,106
She said Nathan
would have wanted it that way.

1568
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:55,899
I said I'd go to that, too.

1569
01:25:56,609 --> 01:25:57,693
Oh.

1570
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:05,617
So, who was this woman that you
wanted to have the affair with, anyway?

1571
01:26:05,702 --> 01:26:09,496
She was just some criminal drifter.

1572
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:13,500
It wasn't that great.

1573
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:16,879
You know, I thought that she was
really into food flavoring and...

1574
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:18,505
- Really?
- Yeah, I should have known better.

1575
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,257
Nobody's into food flavoring.

1576
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:23,552
Well, I don't know.
I mean, you guys sell a lot of that stuff.

1577
01:26:23,636 --> 01:26:25,179
People are into it.

1578
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:33,353
You should know, by the way,

1579
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:35,939
I hired Brad.

1580
01:26:36,941 --> 01:26:39,693
Yeah, I know. You told me that,
remember? The whole...

1581
01:26:39,777 --> 01:26:43,363
No, sorry,
not for the sex thing or the pool.

1582
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:45,949
I mean that I hired him for the factory.

1583
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,952
Why? He's a total moron.

1584
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,705
Yeah, I know.
This is going to sound kind of weird,

1585
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:54,499
but I felt sorry for him.

1586
01:26:55,418 --> 01:26:57,294
Yeah. So did I.

1587
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:03,091
Well, my car's over here, so,

1588
01:27:03,968 --> 01:27:06,970
I guess I'll see you at the Rotary Club?

1589
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,432
Yeah, I'll see you there.

1590
01:27:14,812 --> 01:27:16,063
Suzie?

1591
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:19,399
Should we maybe just take one car?

1592
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:22,444
Yeah. We probably should.

1593
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:24,404
Yeah.

1594
01:27:26,699 --> 01:27:29,826
I thought that was
a surprisingly tasteful funeral.

1595
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:33,997
JOEL: Yes, it was. You know, when
I was looking down on him, I thought,

1596
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:37,793
"This might be the longest
I've ever seen him with his mouth shut."

1597
01:27:37,877 --> 01:27:40,337
SUZIE: Yeah. I didn't expect
that many mourners.

1598
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:42,506
There were a lot of people there.

1599
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:43,632
JOEL: Yeah.

1600
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:50,806
(SINGING) You have been
a friend of mine, rainy day woman

1601
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:55,394
That woman of mine, she ain't happy

1602
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:59,106
Till she finds something wrong
and someone to blame

1603
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:00,857
If it ain't one thing,
it's another one on the way

1604
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:02,526
(PHONE RINGING)

1605
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:05,362
ON ANSWERING MACHINE:
Hey. You've reached Cindy.

1606
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:06,947
I'm not here, so leave a message.

1607
01:28:10,493 --> 01:28:11,910
Where the hell is she?

1608
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:17,749
How long does it take to get some
goddamned cigarettes around here?

1609
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,506
VALET: Here you are, sir.

1610
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:28,552
JOE: What the fuck?

1611
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:24,649
Oh, rainy day woman

1612
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:29,696
I've never seem to see you for
the good times or the sunshine

1613
01:29:31,241 --> 01:29:35,452
You have been a friend of mine,
rainy day woman

1614
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:36,995
Woman
