221
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:50,535
But first and foremost, the people

00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,470
these facilities
are escape-proof

What I'm saying, Miss Ross,

228
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,183
is that these facilities are
privately funded and administered.

229
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,285
So the word "official"
does not really apply.

Welcome to the International

I'm Warden Hobbes.

Yes. Evacuation code.

walk out of here free as a bird?

That he just jumped,
like you said?

406
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:45,122
This isn't a free-for-all.
We're paid to prevent him from jumping.

00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,226
And I can't get proof
of life from a dead man.

So...

409

You will be docked
the entire price of the asset.

They wanted to bury me.
I don't know who, but I'm gonna find out.

coming down the stairs?

805
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:27,422
See how he walks
all pigeon-toed?

806
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:28,957
The Duck.

807
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:30,492
Yeah. The Duck
always works with the guy

808
01:05:30,494 --> 01:05:32,694
scratching the back
of his neck.

809
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:33,962
ROTTMAYER: Hives.

810
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:37,098
Yeah, Hives.

811
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,035
When Duck and Hives work together,
they always do a circle.

812
01:05:40,037 --> 01:05:41,303
They may do it at
random times of day.

813
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:43,338
It doesn't matter
when they do it,

814
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:47,108
it always ends up being 128
strides, then they split up. Watch.

815
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:50,278
Now they each take a side.

816
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,148
Duck walks 63 strides,
Hives 65.

817
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:55,583
Then they meet up at the top.

818
01:05:55,585 --> 01:05:57,485
The guard down there
at the bottom,

819
01:05:57,487 --> 01:05:59,521
the heavy-set guy,
he doesn't move much.

820
01:05:59,523 --> 01:06:01,289
My guess is he's
been here a while

821
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,024
and only does
what he has to do.

822
01:06:03,026 --> 01:06:04,159

823
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:06,995

824
01:06:06,997 --> 01:06:09,230
His fat ass reminds me
of my first girlfriend.

825
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:13,401

could be a problem for us.

827
01:06:15,706 --> 01:06:17,072
He's always looking around.

828
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:18,173
The Chicken Man.

829
01:06:18,175 --> 01:06:21,109
Chicken Man, right.

830
01:06:21,111 --> 01:06:24,079
My guess, Chickie's new here.
Does everything by the book.

831
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:26,548
How do you know when the shift ends?
I don't.

832
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:30,352
But around this time, your girlfriend
Louisa starts looking at her watch.

833
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:32,420
My guess, it's lunchtime.

834

Now that we've got the routine,

837
01:06:41,131 --> 01:06:43,465
we just gotta ask the good
doctor where the hell we are.

I've studied your work very closely.
It's quite brilliant.

it's what I used

as a reference guide
in designing this facility.

This can go two ways.

pretend this never happened.

a lot more than what you were
paid for me, right, Hobbes?

to get what you want.

out, I'll let you go.

that you and Rottmayer share,

01:12:42,992 --> 01:12:45,560

the fucking life out of you.
