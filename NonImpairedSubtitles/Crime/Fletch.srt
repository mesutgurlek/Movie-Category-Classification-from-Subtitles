My name is Erwin Fletcher.

26
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,824
I'm an investigative reporter
for a Los Angeles paper.

27
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,884
You've probably read my stuff
under the byline of Jane Doe.

28
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,328
Is better than Erwin.

29
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,389
Recently I've been
loitering around the beach...

30
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,766
trying to pass for
a minor league junkie.

31
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:20,362
I don't nod out or drool;
thas too obvious.

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,034
Act like you don't care
and you fit right in.

33
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,873
[Whistles]
Business has really picked up.

34
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,378
I'm still closed.

35
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,438
Is it a Colombian national holiday?

36
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,948
What do you figure, Sam?

37
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,717
No idea.

38
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,588
- No idea at all?
- Some idea.

39
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,991
Like when?

40
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,120
When it comes, it comes.

41
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,522
I got some reds.

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,491
You don't mean communists,
do you?

43
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,060
Is everything a joke
to you, Fletch?

44
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,662
Everything, Sam.

45
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,739
- Hey, Gummy!
- Hey, Fletch. Hey, Sam.

46
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,438
How's the eye?

47
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,538
Is OK.
The cops did it.

48
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,674
They always
beating up on me.

49
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,762
- He doesn't know.
- Son of a bitch!

50
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,467
Thas what he said.

51
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:34,035
He doesn't know?
How come he doesn't know?

52
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,343
I don't know.
He just doesn't know.

53
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,475
Son of a bitch!

54
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,743
I wonder how he
gets the stuff.

55
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,448
I have no idea.

56
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,650
Sam never leaves the beach.

57
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,058
He sits in that chair.
He's out of shit.

58
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:52,029
Suddenly he gets up,
he's got shit.

59
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,896
Where's it coming from?
The sand?

60
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,961
Thas highly unlikely, Grease.

61
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,333
I oughta get some sleep.

62
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,137
Grease, how old are you?

63
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,578
Nineteen.

64
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,442
You're not taking
very good care of yourself.

65
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,594
[Fletch]
If you haven't guessed, there's been
a lot of drug traffic on the beach.

66
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,894
I'm not talking about No-Doze.

67
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,163
I talkin' about the hard stuff.
A lot of it.

68
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,196
I've been trying to find out
who's behind it.

69
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,299
It hasn't been easy.

70
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,367
I don't shower much.

71
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,650
Excuse me. I have something
I'd like to discuss with you.

72
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,715
- Whas that?
- We can't talk about it here.

73
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,853
- Why not?
- Because we can't.

74
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:02,365
You on a scavenger hunt, or did I
forget to pay my dinner check?

75
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,869
Come to my house
to talk.

76
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,461
Wrong gal, fella.

77
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,564
I'll give you
$1,000 cash.

78
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,070
What?

79
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,203
Come to my house
and listen to the proposition.

80
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,811
If you reject the proposition,
you keep the thousand...

81
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,144
and your mouth shut.

82
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,252
Does this entail
my dressing up as Little Bo Peep?

83
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:35,161
- Is nothing of a sexual nature.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,327
One thousand just to listen?

85
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,997
How can you pass that up,
Mister...

86
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,099
Nugent. Ted Nugent.

87
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,576
Alan Stanwyk.

88
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,136
Alan, charmed.

89
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,608
For an extra grand, I'll let you
take me out to dinner.

90
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,903
What a coincidence.

91
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,876
What?

92
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,641
I almost bought
this place.

93
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,649
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy
killed himself here. Blew it for me.

94
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,810
- Who?
- Hopalong Cassidy.

95
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,650
Bow and arrow.
Very weird.

96
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,553
Are you doped up?

97
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,616
Don't talk to me like that.
I don't work for you.

98
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,228
- Buenos días.
- Buenos días.

99
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,289
Pup 'N' Taco.

100
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,361
Oh, you've remodeled
the garage.

101
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,498
Must have
cost you hundreds.

102
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,404
Good idea.
I oughta frame mine.

103
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,238
Will the Pope
be in later?

104
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,555
Here's my proposition.

105
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,158
I'm all ears.

106
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,169
I want you
to murder me.

107
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,439
Here...

108
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,976
on Thursday.

109
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,236
I'd like you
to shoot me dead.

110
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,415
The reason
I ask for this service...

111
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,117
is because I'm already facing
a very long...

112
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,684
painful and most certain death.

113
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,764
You see, I have bone cancer.

114
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:49,928
I don't know if you
know about bone cancer.

115
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,095
Is the worst kind you can get.

116
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,197
It just eats you up
bit by bit.

117
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,705
You don't look sick.

118
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,079
I don't feel sick. Not yet.

119
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,711
Ill get bad
in a month.

120
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,813
After that, I'd rather
not be around for it.

121
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,950
Why not try suicide?

122
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,721
I've thought about it.

123
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,992
My company's taken out
a large life insurance policy on me.

124
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:23,502
Suicide would nullify it,
but murder does not.

125
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,742
- Why me?
- You're a drifter.

126
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:35,338
A, uh... pardon the expression...
a junkie.

127
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,178
Nobody would notice
if you disappeared.

128
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:42,380
I've been watching you
for a couple of weeks.

129
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,616
Maybe I'm
just on vacation.

130
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,126
Not with the scum
you hang out with.

131
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,891
No, I've watched...
and I've thought.

132
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,693
Is an elegant plan.

133
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,893
I've even figured out
your escape.

134
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,367
Swell.

135
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:03,607
Has it ever occurred to you
I might not want to murder you?

136
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,443
I've got $50,000
says you will.

137
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,614
50,000.

138
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,674
And a guarantee you
won't get caught.

139
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,743
I'm still here.

140
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,114
I want it done Thursday
around 8:00 p.m.

141
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,853
My wife will be out,
and is the staff's night off.

142
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,193
- These will be open.
- Wouldn't they normally be locked?

143
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:28,028
Sometimes. The staff
usually forgets.

144
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,432
I have the same trouble
with my help.

145
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,768
I'll be here
waiting for you.

146
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,898
The safe will be open.

147
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,976
There will be
$50,000 in it.

148
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:43,743
You'll be wearing rubber gloves.
Do you own rubber gloves?

149
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,910
I rent 'em. I have
a lease with an option to buy.

150
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,945
Now in this drawer...

151
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:52,982
Ah!

152
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,526
A.357 Magnum.

153
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,960
My.357. You use it.

154
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,361
No one can trace it to you.

155
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,423
The room will be
in disarray.

156
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,934
Like a burglary attempt?

157
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:08,065
You come in and catch me
stealing your ties and money?

158
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,077
We scuffle. The gun
gets loose and I shoot you.

159
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,737
Precisely.

160
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,883
- Are you a good shot?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

161
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,409
Get me on the first shot,
if you can.

162
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,252
- Do you have a passport?
- Can dig one up.

163
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:29,693
Good. Now, after you kill me,
take the Jaguar.

164
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,287
The keys will be
in the glove compartment.

165
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,459
- Take it where?
- L.A.X.

166
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,798
Pan Am will have a ticket for you.

167
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,861
- Where am I going?
- Rio.

168
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,339
It departs at 11 p.m.

169
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,638
They serve dinner onboard?

170
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,803
And a movie and drinks.

171
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,371
Stay down there
for a year.

172
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,714
So?

173
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,012
So...

174
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,384
You certainly
thought this out.

175
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,985
I don't leave
a great deal to chance.

176
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,262
Those will be open?

177
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,859
Take care of the gloves,
the passport and the aim.

178
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,335
I'll handle
everything else.

179
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,340
The gun, the money,
the tickets...

180
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,841
and the dying.

181
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,900
Thas right.

182
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,277
Looks like you
get the hard part.

183
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,282
What do you say?

184
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,944
You'll be doing me
a great service.

185
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,515
Will you kill me?

186
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,489
Sure.

187
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,904
Hey! Good to see you.

188
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,470
Slouch,
how are you?

189
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,507
Can I steal you?

190
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,348
If you promise
not to return me.

191
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,354
- Magic today?
- Yeah, Kareem's in the wash.

192
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,049
I need a favor.

193
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,615
- Fletch!
- Did you hear something?

194
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,685
See what we have on Alan Stanwyk
in Beverly Hills.

195
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,560
I need this right away.

196
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,259
- I take it the story's done.
- W-Y-K.

197
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,325
Tell me I'm right.

198
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,394
You're right,
but you're very peaked.

199
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,032
Want to vomit?
Come on in.

200
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,440
- The story's done, right?
- Uh... almost.

201
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,341
Almost is not an answer.

202
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,539
Yes is an answer.

203
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,344
And a damn fine answer.

204
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,509
Professional journalism time now.

205
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,749
Go back and finish
the story!

206
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,689
Frank, I will.
I swear it.

207
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,124
Something came up.

208
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,320
You've got
a deadline tomorrow.

209
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,386
Did you see Sunday's ad?

210
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,456
I don't read the paper.
Whas the spread on tonighs game?

211
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,264
- Lakers by six.
- Take a look.

212
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,831
Shame of the City.
Thas very nice.

213
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,807
Try to follow this.

214
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,868
You can't run the ad
and then not run the story.

215
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,604
You can't? Why not?

216
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,406
Shit. Really?

217
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:10,387
I'm putting you on. You'll get
the story. You'll be proud of it.

218
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,822
You broke it?
You know the source?

219
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,189
Practically.

220
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,093
Is it Fat Sam?
You said you had pictures of him.

221
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:20,360
- I do have pictures of him dealing.
- Les go. We'll run them.

222
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,990
You can't do that.

223
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,230
Fat Sam isn't the story.
There's a source behind him.

224
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,204
Who?

225
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,900
Thas a gray area.

226
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,134
How gray?

227
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,370
Charcoal.

228
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,071
May I help you with that?

229
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,878
OK. A little lighter.

230
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,920
Can you go higher?

231
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,979
Over to the right.
Higher. Perfect.

232
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,083
Nice and hard.
Thas good. Thank you.

233
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,151
- That it?
- Perfect.

234
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,992
Everything's recent.

235
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:55,556
Let me see that. Alan Stanwyk,
commercial airline pilot...

236
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,568
from Provo, Utah."

237
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,537
Formerly a test pilot,
member of the Jaycees.

238
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,335
- Move on?
- Yeah.

239
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,243
Married Boyd Aviation.

240
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,370
He's no dummy.
Thas big bucks.

241
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:11,314
His parents are Marvin and Velma,
were unable to attend the wedding.

242
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:15,285
Those are three names I enjoy:
Marvin, Velma and Provo.

243
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,819
Hold it there.

244
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:22,122
Cancer.
Cancer Society Benefit.

245
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,630
Internist Dr. Joseph Dolan.

246
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,826
I wonder if
thas his doctor.

247
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,892
One way to find out.

248
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,665
There is.

249
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,499
Where do you
know Alan from?

250
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,475
We play tennis
at the club.

251
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,011
California Racquet Club?

252
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,604
- Right.
- Thas my club too.

253
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,580
I don't remember
seeing you there.

254
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:50,520
I haven't been playing
because of these kidney pains.

255
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:54,821
Right. How long have you
had these pains, Mr. Barber?

256
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,452
No, thas Babar.

257
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,055
Two B's?

258
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,862
One B.
B-A-B-A-R.

259
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,232
- Thas two.
- Yeah, but not together.

260
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,203
I thought
thas what you meant.

261
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,675
Arnold Babar.

262
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,677
Aren't there
children's books...

263
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,975
about an elephant
named Babar?

264
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,176
- I don't know. I don't have any.
- No children?

265
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,685
No, elephant books.

266
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,688
Open wide.

267
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,582
Say, Ah.

268
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,023
Aah.

269
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,995
Is an odd name.

270
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,963
I haven't seen it
on the club registry.

271
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:36,490
I don't formally belong.
I'm a guest of my auns.

272
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:37,933
Your aunt?

273
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,064
- Right. Mrs. Smith.
- Joan or Margaret?

274
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,573
Uh-huh.

275
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,040
Which one?

276
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,202
Margaret.

277
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,774
Funny old bird.

278
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,873
I could tell you
some stories.

279
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,441
I bet.

280
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,786
You know,
is a shame about Ed.

281
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,792
It was.
That was really a shame.

282
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,794
To go so suddenly.

283
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,023
He was dying
for years.

284
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:09,363
But the end
was very sudden.

285
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,261
He was in intensive care
for eight weeks.

286
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,330
But the very end,
when he actually died...

287
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,409
was extremely sudden.

288
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,073
Alan and I were recently
speaking of dying.

289
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,447
He told me Boyd Aviation took out
a large insurance policy on him.

290
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,778
You've got to be
in perfect shape...

291
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,585
to get that sort
of a policy, I bet.

292
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,149
Drop your shorts
and bend over, Mr. Babar.

293
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:38,253
No, really.
We don't need to.

294
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,594
We don't want
to do that.

295
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,926
My kidneys feel better
in this position.

296
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,904
Maybe is that I'm not doing
any calisthenics.

297
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,167
If I did sit-ups
or bent over like this...

298
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,209
I'd feel 100% bet...

299
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:54,473
# Moon River ##

300
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,538
Whew! Thank you, Doc.
You ever serve time?

301
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,777
- Breathe easy.
- Breathe easy.

302
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,180
I was surprised Alan
got that policy.

303
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,451
There's a history of cancer
in the family.

304
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,652
- There is?
- Yeah.

305
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,219
As a matter of fact... Aah!
You using the whole fist?

306
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,764
Just relax.

307
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,666
I saw Alan the other day.
He was looking peaked.

308
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,205
Are you sure
he's all right?

309
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:24,265
I can't discuss another patient.
You know that.

310
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,874
Well, I don't find
anything wrong with you.

311
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:31,109
I'm sure is not
for a lack of looking.

312
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,009
12 noon.

313
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,487
I was anxious
to return to my drug story.

314
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,218
But since Dr. Jellyfinger
wasn't talking...

315
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,284
I had to find out
about Stanwyk's health.

316
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,200
May I help you, Dr., uh...

317
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,396
Dr. Rosenpenis. I'm here
to check Stanwyk's file.

318
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,665
Doctor who?

319
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,104
Dr. Rosenrosen.

320
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,108
Your name again.

321
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,871
Is Dr. Rosenhite.

322
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,571
Doctor who?

323
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,671
Dr. Rosen.
Where's the records room?

324
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,808
- Next to Pathology.
- Would you take care of these things?

325
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:09,342
I'd like to check
Alan Stanwyk's file.

326
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,288
Where the hell's
the records room?

327
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,587
Next to Pathology, B1.

328
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,493
Collate these for me.
Where did you say that was?

329
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,531
- B1.
- Thank you very much.

330
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,532
- Take the elevator.
- Thank you.

331
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,269
Give me a hand, Doctor.

332
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,169
Me?

333
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,867
Come on!

334
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,575
Yeah.

335
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,952
Have you ever seen a spleen
that large?

336
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,286
No, not since breakfast.

337
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,916
Here. Hold this.

338
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,224
I haven't sterilized
my hands.

339
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:27,459
You won't make him
any sicker.

340
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,331

[Instruments Banging]

342
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,570
I'll get it.

343
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,136
[Clang]

344
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,510
Ah, oh!

345
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,678
You never get used
to the smell, do ya?

346
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,148
[Crash]

347
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,389
Oh, Doctor.
Are you all right?

348
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:01,796
Where am I?

349
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,335
- The records room.
- The records room?

350
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,304
- I'm fine.
- Can I get you something?

351
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,432
Do you have
The Beatles' White Album?

352
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,636
Never mind. Get me
a glass of hot fat.

353
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,702
And bring me the head
of Alfredo Garcia.

354
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,978
Dr. Holmes was
surprised you fainted.

355
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,110
He was surprised?

356
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,211
I thought that body
was my dead brother.

357
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,188
Oh!

358
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,157
That spleen was
the spitting image.

359
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,126
No, I'm fine.

360
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,858
Nurse, I'm hyperventilating.

361
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,924
Would you get me
a paper bag?

362
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,061
- Yes, right away.
- Thank you.

363
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,254
Here you are, Doctor.

364
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,721
Oh, thank you.

365
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,724
Can I help you?

366
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,783
No. Uh, yes, there is,
actually.

367
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,456
One of my associates
was doing a biopsy on this man.

368
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:46,300
They said he had a melanoma,
carcinoma... some kind of noma.

369
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,899
There's no record
of it here.

370
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,876
If he had one,
it would be in here.

371
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,071
Wait. Here it is.

372
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,139
Surgical removal
of two moles.

373
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,275
Tissue was benign."

374
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,285
Benign? There's no mention
of cancer? Thas it?

375
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,846
Thas it.

376
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,451
This is one month ago.

377
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,826
According to this hospital,
Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.

378
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,423
I guess not.

379
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,929
He'll be so relieved.

380
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,373
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

381
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,432
Have a nice day.

382

[Bang]

383
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,532
I'm not finished.

384
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,801
- Sorry, Mr. Underhill.
- Do I look finished?

385
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,274
I guess not.

386
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:02,671
- Now I'm finished.
- Whatever you say.

387
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:13,022
You're expecting
a nice gratuity, right?

388
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,252
Maybe next time.

389
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,630
Gail Stanwyk?

390
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,033
Yeah.

391
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,968
I haven't seen you
since the wedding. You look great.

392
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,336
I do?
Thas sweet of you.

393
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,406
I musve been plowed
at your wedding.

394
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,344
I don't know you.

395
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,573
Not my wedding,
your wedding.

396
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,745
Oh, my wedding.
Thank God.

397
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:46,222
Doesn't really help me.
Are you a friend of Alan's?

398
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,418
Yes, we flew together.
I'm John.

399
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,427
Oh, John.

400
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:56,299
Oh, yes.

00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,699
No. John who?

00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,500
John Cocktoasttoy.

403
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:01,698
Beautiful name.

404
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,240
Is Scotch-Rumanian.

405
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,708
- An odd combination.
- So were my parents.

406
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:10,181
Do you mind if I
practice some more?

407
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,738
Go ahead.

408
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,819
You're a member
of the club, señor?

409
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,361
No. I'm with the Underhills.

410
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,987
They left, señor.

411
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:29,056
He'll be back
after his urinalysis.

412
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,193
Would you like some drinks?

413
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,328
I'll put it on
the Underhills' bill.

414
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,639
Yes. I'll have
a Bloody Mary...

415
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,473
a steak sandwich,
and a steak sandwich.

416
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,116
So how's Alan?

417
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:51,485
He's been so busy lately,
I hardly see him.

418
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:54,320
- He's been preoccupied.
- With what?

419
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:57,020
I don't know.
Personal stuff.

420
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,620
Whoa!
I hit one.

421
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,791
Lobs are important
in tennis.

422
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:02,959
Sorry, sir.

423
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:08,500
I'll show you
a couple things.

424
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,336
Stand here.

425
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,605
When the ball comes,
face it like this.

426
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,168
Yeah.

427
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,839
And then
pivot your body,

428
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,406
step in
with your left foot.

429
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,315
Just like this.

430
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,785
OK?

431
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,515
Go ahead. Try one.

432
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,079
All right.
Go ahead.

433
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,091
Get in position.

434
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,356
The ball's going to come.
Ready?

435
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,090
How many are
in the machine?

436
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:35,758
- A lot, I thought.
- Is finished.

437
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,631
Good.
Much better.

438
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,271
I must be having an off day.
I'm usually a fabulous player.

439
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,365
I affect women this way.

440
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:46,376
I bet you do.

441
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:50,073
I bumped into Alan
this morning.

442
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,139
You know what
I can't figure out?

443
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,844
Alan's in Utah.

444
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,650
I can't figure out what I was doing
in Utah this morning.

445
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:04,020
I'm very flattered,
but I'm also very married.

446
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,964
You're hitting
on me, aren't you?

447
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,295
How did you guess?

448
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,533
I'm such a heel.
Don't know what came over me.

449
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:17,701
If I had a nickel
for every one of Alan's flyboy
buddies who tried to pick me up...

450
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,175
I'd be rich.

451
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,074
You are rich.

452
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,875
See what I mean?

453
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,186
The vice president knew
I was opening the door...

454
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,983
but the Secret Service...

455
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,523
Whack!
And blood...

456
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,418
Washington.

457
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,257
Sugar, Mr. Poon?

458
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,491
No, never, never.
Thank you.

459
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,671
Well, now,
let me reiterate...

460
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,106
that this is not
a formal investigation.

461
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:55,408
If Alan Stanwyk isn't involved
in improprieties...

462
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,881
Alan Stanwyk is not involved
in any improprieties.

463
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,818
How can the S.E.C.
make such an accusation?

464
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,151
You know that,
and I know that...

465
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:08,522
but somebody's bucking
for a promotion.

466
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,720
Is probably that
pederast Hanrahan.

467
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,854
If I don't go back
with something...

468
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,297
you and your son-in-law
will be the scapegoats.

469
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,029
Unbelievable.
This is unbelievable.

470
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:21,038
They want to know
why he's in Utah.

471
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:24,598
Jesus H. Christ
on a Popsicle stick.

472
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:25,938
First of all...

473
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:29,344
Alan Stanwyk does not own
one single share of stock.

474
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,308
The $3 million
for the ranch in Provo...

475
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,545
was entirely provided
by my daughter...

476
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:39,955
who converted her personal,
non-corporate holdings.

477
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,022
So, if any
of your D.C. boys...

478
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:47,428
want to challenge that,
bring them on.

479
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:52,527
Otherwise, tell them
to get out of my face.

480
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,140
God, I admire you.

481
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,337
Well...

482
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,406
consider
this case closed.

483
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,682
It stopped bleeding.
Isn't that something?

484

My pleasure.

485

Thank you and good day.

486
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,657
By the way...

487
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,354
what kind
of a name is Poon?

488
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,698
Comanche Indian.
Good-bye.

489
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,372
Madeline, Frieda lost the number
for Alan's realtor in Provo, Utah.

490
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,998
Could you get me that?

491
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,134
- Jim Swarthout?
- Yeah.

492
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,780
- Who are you again?
- I'm Frieda's boss.

493
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:41,183
- Who's Frieda?
- My secretary.

494
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:47,283
I knew my junkie pals were awaiting
my good cheer on the beach...

495
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,350
but I needed a second wind,
a beer and a wardrobe change.

496
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,795
As I pulled up to
my imitation apartment building...

497
00:28:56,868 --> 00:29:01,601
I observed the Oldsmobuick
of Mr. Arnold T. Pants, Esquire...

498
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,733
attorney for the former
Mrs. Erwin Fletcher.

499
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,672
Time to use
the service entrance.

500
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:47,751
Refusal to pay alimony
is a jailable offense, Fletch.

501
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,790
What about trespassing
and loitering?

502
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:56,019
I am neither loitering
nor trespassing.

503
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,426
I've simply chosen
an advisable location...

504
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,021
to await my cliens
delinquent husband.

505
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,193
I prefer to discuss
business inside.

506
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,963
Leave your rubbers outside.

507
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,869
A little one-on-one?

508
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,982
He draws the foul.

509
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,951
You owe Wendy $918.

510
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:29,118
She doesn't need it. She's been
living with somebody for months.

511
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,219
I don't
what you're referring to.

512
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,161
Wendy maintains
her own residence.

513
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:34,664
This stinks.

514
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:38,099
I empathize, Fletch.
However, you threw her out.

515
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,228
She slept with everybody.

516
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,102
Prove that in court.

517
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,038
My lawyer was a bum.

518
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,405
I agree.

519
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,034
They slept together.

520
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,636
You may be right.

521
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,113
Are you serious?

522
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,649
Thas history, Fletch.

be solved. Ed McMahon.

just won $1 million.

527

Erwin M. Fletcher,
you choose.

528
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,761
Whoo-ee! I lost. Sorry.

529
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,499
Is no joke, Fletch.

530
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:20,533
If some kind of payment isn't made,
I'll have to garnish your wages.

531
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,304
I can't have
my wages garnish-ied.

532
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,371
Tell you what.

533
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,850
Cash? I'm impressed.

534
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,911
I saw my pimp today.

535
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,221
Open your raincoat.

536
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,691
Come on. Just once.
Is worth it.

537

Apply some towards next month.

538

- Now scram.
- Till then.

539

Keep 10 and get yourself
a nice piece of ass.

540

Our guest is
the most valuable player...

541
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,352
of the National
Basketball Association...

542
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,360
from the Los Angeles Lakers...

543
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,556
the all-time scoring champion
of the N.B.A., Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

544
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,566
He's coming off a game that was
second to none in his brilliant career.

545
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:17,999
You must be proud.

546
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,196
Definitely, Chick.
It was a great effort.

547
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,365
But I had a lot of help,
and we're just glad to be here.

548
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,341
How about Fletch?

549
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,573
What can I say about Fletch?
He's been fantastic.

550
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:31,444
He boxes out for us,
gets the tough rebounds...

551
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,677
and does what
we need to win.

552
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,914
Is great working with him. I don't
know where we'd be without him.

553
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,783
Les look at the play.
He's 6'5. With the Afro, 6'9.

554
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:45,659
Good dribbler. Comes in deep.
His club is behind by one point.

555
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,461
Fletch puts the ball through the legs.
What a great play!

556
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,968
He puts it in!
The Lakers have the lead!

557
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:56,097
Was that some play! This kid
from Harlem really creates excitement.

558
00:32:56,174 --> 00:33:00,508
$4 million a year,
but he earns every nickel.

559
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:04,674
Look how he shakes off
four or five defenders with ease.

560
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:08,344
Fletch... he truly defines
grace under pressure.

561
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:17,720
See if you've got anything on Stanwyk
from when he lived in Utah.

562
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:21,094
Yeah. And check out a realtor
in Provo named Swarthout.

563

00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,183
Take off, Fletch!

567
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,780
They're after
Gummy again.

Slow down.
This is dumb.

Come on, man!

He's defenseless.

Don't...

572
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,430
Get up!

Beat it, cop!

577
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,018
Hey, you're really nuts.

578
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:27,458
You OK?

579
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,557
Yeah. I feel like $100.

580
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:33,900
- They didn't do anything.
- What are you talking about?

581
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,871
I busted their window.

582

You're lucky.

583
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,934
Is not luck.
They didn't want me.

584
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:43,469
They wanted Gummy.

Relax, Frank.
I need more time.

587
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,130

or Jim Swarthout.

on the back burner.

All right, Frank.

Say, Fletch.

645
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,112
Look, defenseless babies.

646
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,143
Fell for the oldest trick
in the book.

647
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:54,201
# Strangers in the night #

648
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,678
# Exchanging clothing #

649
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:59,181
# Strangers in my pants... ##

650
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:02,975
Surprise!

651
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:05,419
- What the hell's...
- Police. Spread 'em!

652
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,023
- Got a gun?
- Shamu's got one. Borrow his.

653
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,356
- What have we here?
- Thas my dick.

654
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,364
Oh, funny boy.

655
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,024
What have we here?

656
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,001
Looks like heroin, Gene.

657
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,060
You just planted that.

658
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:24,164
- Whad you say?
- Wanna read me my rights?

659
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,505
You have the right
to remain silent.

660
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,602
You have the right
to have your face kicked in.

661
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,737
Nice.

662
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,940
You have the right to have
your balls stomped by him.

663
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,115
I'll waive my rights.

664
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,759
Whas the booking, gentlemen?

665
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,492
Possession of narcotics.
The chief wants to talk to him.

666
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,968
You'll like Chief Karlin.
He's a nice man.

667
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:56,165
I hear he's mellowed
since he came out of the closet.

668
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,731
Take his picture
while he still has a face.

669
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,004
That hurts.
You've been hurting.

670
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,903
Give him a buzz.

671
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,505
Come in.

672
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,574
Here he is, Chief.

673
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:13,020
Easy, fellas. I'll be
with you in a moment.

674
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,368
Did Mrs. Chief of Police
help you decorate?

675
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,737
So... whas your name?

676
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:36,279
Fletch.

677
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:40,078
- Full name.
- Fletch. F. Fletch.

678
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:44,348
I see. What do you do
for a living, Mr. Fletch?

679
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:45,911
I'm a shepherd.

680
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,787
Officers, could you excuse us
for a few moments?

681
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,124
Go to the gym
and pump each other.

682
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:00,766
Why are you doing this?

683
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:02,966
I like men.

684
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,031
I like to be manhandled.

685
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,742
I like you.

686
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:12,248
For someone caught holding
a bag of heroin...

687
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,808
- That was planted.
- We're looking at maybe 10 years.

688
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,047
Is that what you want, Jane Doe?

689
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,115
Your editor phoned me...

690
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:23,216
to respond to allegations
you're about to print...

691
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:26,592
concerning police involvement
in narcotics dealings.

692
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,657
Uh-uh. I'm about to bust
that beach wide open.

693
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:33,134
I don't need some penny-ante
Woodward and Bernstein...

694
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:35,262
to get in the way
of my men.

695
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,275
Your men may be involved in this.
I would think that might interest you.

696
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,970
Idiot!

697
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,971
All right.
Strictly off the record, OK?

698
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,415
Yeah, OK.

699
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:50,419
I got that beach crawling
with undercover cops.

700
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:54,753
But if you go nosing around,
you'll make the bad guys more cautious.

701
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,089
Makes my job harder.

702
00:44:57,161 --> 00:45:01,029
And listen, if you print
your story this week...

703
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:03,658
it might get
some of my men killed.

704
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:06,396
I can't have that,
Mr. Fletch.

705
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,801
You understand?

706
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,202
Yeah.

707
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,763
I understand.

708
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,309
I got a deadline.

709
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,503
The name's Karlin
with a K?

710
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,446
You dipshit!

711
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,610
Go back to that beach,
you won't live to regret it!

712
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:25,314
All right?

713
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,388
Hey, you and
Tommy Lasorda.

714
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,984
- Yeah.
- I hate Tommy Lasorda.

715
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,000
Hey!

716
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:44,464
I'll take care of it now.

717
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,476
# Swing low,
sweet chariot #

718
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,978
I'll handle it from here.

719
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:53,676
# Comin' for
to carry me home ##

720
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,241
Can't keep me here.

721
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,719
Maybe I won't keep you.

722
00:45:57,788 --> 00:46:00,814
Maybe I'll blow
your brains out.

723
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:05,686
I do believe thas
a violation of my rights.

724
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:09,824
After I shoot you,
I stick myself with this knife...

725
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,993
and place it
in your dead hand.

726
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,367
Self-defense.

727
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:18,033
We don't do it anymore,
but back in the old days...

728
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:21,739
You're serious.

729
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,871
Ask anybody.

730
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,576
Can I ask anybody now?

731
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:29,710
Can I call my mom,
tell her I love her.

732
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,880
Uh... guess not.

733
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:46,429
I'm a newspaper reporter. You don't
blow away newspaper reporters.

734
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,494
Kinda stupid, isn't it?

735
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,301
What will it be, Fletch?

736
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,043
Hey, I hate the beach anyway.

737
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,107
Is not even my story.

738
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,246
I've got a deadline
on the off-track betting...

739
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,846
in the Himalayas.

740
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,415
Smaller story, but I know
you've been following it.

741
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:15,126
You have things
under control down there.

742
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,224
Your beach.

743
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,299
Come on out.
Come on.

744
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,776
May I? Thank you.

745
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,740
How could you call him?

746
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:31,075
Fletch, I'm sorry.

747
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,116
You know how close
to death I came?

748
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,014
Yeah, is awful.

749
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:39,453
He had a gun at my head
and a knife in his hand!

750
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,354
He threatened
to kill me.

751
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,586
Hey, thas a shame.

752
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,594
He woulïve shot me.

753
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:46,686
Unbelievable.

754
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,060
You don't believe me.

755
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:55,594
Nope.

756
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,704
- He thinks I'm lying.
- Unbelievable.

757
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,005
I need an article
by tomorrow.

758
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:03,012
- You believe me.
- Yes, I do.

759
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,981
I don't want unsubstantiated charges
about dope-dealing cops...

760
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:10,543
or paranoid fantasies
about homicidal police chiefs.

761
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:12,714
Give me something
I can print!

762
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,316
Print this.

763
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:19,895
Me, too.

764
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:23,524
Hey, watch it.
You're on thin ice, Larry.

765
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:34,169
It was time to hang out
at Boyd Aviation...

766
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,736
to find out what Stanwyk
was doing with that plane.

767
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:39,577
I splurged.

768
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,642
I invested 49 cents
on some novelty teeth.

769
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,955
Hey!

770
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:57,933
- You the guy from Ajax?
- Yeah, you bet.

771
00:48:58,001 --> 00:48:59,059
All right.

772
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,127
- Thought you were bringing the eight?
- They're coming.

773
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:04,935
I'm the supervisor.
I don't carry the stuff.

774
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,908
Freddie's bringing them?

775
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,444
Yeah. Freddie.

776
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:11,913
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago.

777
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:14,382
Traffic was murder.

778
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:18,410
A manure spreader
jackknifed on the Santa Ana.

779
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,422
God-awful mess.

780
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,890
You should see my shoes.

781
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,894
Whew!

782
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,131
Stanwyk's baby, huh?

783
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:30,860
Yeah.

784
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,526
Uh-huh.

785
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:39,632
Looks well-used.

786
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,735
Travels to Utah every weekend.

787
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,609
Is that right?

788
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,375
Is he a Mormon?

789
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,284
I don't think he's doing
a lot of singing...

790
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,549
with the Tabernacle Choir.

791
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:55,455
These executives live high.
Know what I mean?

792
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,015
I sure do.

793
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:08,769
Thas a terrific wing.
I love this shape.

794
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,272
Do us a favor, pal.

795
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,072
Name's Liddy.
Gordon Liddy.

796
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:18,046
Take a look
at the seventh Fetzer valve.

797
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:19,582
Is been sticking.

798
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,779
Probably the humidity.

799
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,486
Thas funny.

800
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:29,013
I think is
the by-pass line.

801
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,629
It could be the by-pass line.
I should look at it.

802
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:39,791
Uh, Gordo?

803
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:42,327
Back here?

804
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,737
Don't tell me
my business, boy!

805
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:48,539
Just checking the luggage.

806
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:52,309
Somebody should clean these windows.
There's gook all over 'em.

807
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,111
Look at that.

808
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,276
You use a lot of fuel
to go to Utah?

809
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:58,946
I ask that, too.

810
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:01,616
Burns enough to go
to South America and back.

811
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:03,716
South America and back.

812
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:06,987
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

813

Nothing.
He just gives me that look.

00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:21,136
You know,

Yeah, he just gives him
that look.

00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,647
Sure.
He's the boss.

Oh, ho ho.

I'll need some pliers...

828
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:50,064

ball bearings.

Tell ya what.
I gotta go to my truck.

831
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:57,947
If Fred gets here before I'm back,
tell him to start without me.

832
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:01,040
Why do you need
ball bearings?

833
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,517
Come on, guys.

834
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,316
Maybe you need
a refresher course.

835
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:08,380
Hey, is all
ball bearings nowadays.

836
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:14,357
Prepare that valve
with 3-in-1 oil...

837
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:16,490
and gauze pads.

838

No, make that
Quaker State.

841

I'm supposed to meet her.
Cabana six?

846

Cabana one. You would like
something to eat or drink?

847
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,622
Actually, I would.

848
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:41,680
Charge it
to the Underhills?

849
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,885
Right.
Do you have any caviar?

850
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,656
Sí, señor. Beluga.
But it is $80 a portion.

851
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,994
I better just take
two portions.

Yeah.
Can I borrow your towel?

a water buffalo.

Nice place.

869

I'm surprised to see you.
What are you doing here?

870
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,355

For here?

872
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:50,887
I knew this is where
my mouth would be.

873
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:54,925
I really should change.

874
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,967
No, you should stay
the wonderful person you are today.

875
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:59,831
I mean put clothes on.

Um, because I'm bored.

If you're bored, why didn't you
go to Utah with Alan?

911

Utah's not exactly
a cure for boredom.

Good point.

00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,650
He's told me a lot of things.

967
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,924
So far, not one has been true.

968
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,965
I'm sorry to have to
tell you these things.

969
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,159
- Mrs. Stanwyk!
- Just wait a minute!

970
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,464
- I'll call my father. He'll know.
- No, you can't.

971
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:33,532
I know you don't know me,
but you've gotta trust me.

972
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:37,774
Give me 24 hours.

973
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,781
Mrs. Stanwyk!

974
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:44,079
You a Laker fan?

975
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:47,589
No.

976
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:50,057
- Just a minute!
- I'll take you to a game.

977
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:52,458
Mrs. Stanwyk!

978
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,396
Sorry. Thanks. Bye.

979
00:58:57,467 --> 00:59:01,836
- What are you talking about?
- I'd like to take you to a Laker game.

980
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:05,637
- If you need me, call the paper.
- What do I do for 24 hours?

981
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,768
- Act natural.
- I was afraid you'd say that.

982
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:48,770
Oh, Jesus. Whas he
doing with the chief?

983
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:51,940
[Fletch] Seeing Bone Cancer
and Chief Karlin together...

984
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:54,279
might lead
to a page one item.

985
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:57,751
but without real evidence,
Frank wouldn't print it.

986
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,812
I had to keep digging...
without a shovel.

987
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,356
Smog Patrol.
Had your emissions checked?

988
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,228
- No, sir.
- Fluorocarbons? Ozone?

989
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:45,529
- No, sir.
- Well, les check it out.

990
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:47,398
What do you say?

991
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:49,528
Smells pretty good.

992
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:59,038
Thas him.

993
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:01,750
Unit 12, in pursuit.

994
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,883
Catch some shuteye.
Lay back and enjoy.

995
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:16,022
- Try to breathe through your nose.
- Aaah!

996
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:35,042
I use chewing gum on these rides.
It filters out the pollutants.

997
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:36,449
Aw, shit!

998
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,987
You've got good grillwork.
Keep out the ozone.

999
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:42,821
I gotta get this thing up to 95,
check out the fluorocarbon output.

1000
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:49,497
Don't worry about the speed limit.
Thas why we've got the police escort.

1001
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:51,624
- You a cop?
- As far as you know.

1002
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:55,034
You gonna take me to jail
for car theft?

1003
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,595
- Why, did you steal the car?
- I sure did!

1004
01:02:57,673 --> 01:03:00,665
I'm not even sure
thas a crime anymore.

1005
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:02,176
Pull over!

1006
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,841
Hey, look out
for that truck!

1007
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:14,854
Just a game I play with my buddies.
Hide-and-seek kind of thing.

1008
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:16,323
They love it.

1009
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:20,321
What a day!

1010
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:22,660
Must be a stage two.

1011
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:24,632
Do a little slip-streaming.

1012
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,895
Whoa! There's Fred!
Won't he be surprised!

1013
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:44,517
Don't you hear me?
I said pull over...

1014
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:49,221
Uh-oh.

1015
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:54,658
Got a license?

1016
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,527
Not on me.
You have one?

1017
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:58,999
- No.
- Pull over, buddy!

1018
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:03,266
- Hey, Freddie, how's the herpes?
- Pull over!

1019
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:06,740
- I did before. I'll pull over later.
- Pull over!

1020
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:10,506
Thas it.
Turn your bike in!

1021
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,048
- You're a disgrace to the force!
- [Kid] Aaah!

1022
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:33,926
Get the door!

1023
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,375
Congratulations.
You passed the test.

1024
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:49,612
Raise your left hand.
My men will be right with you.

1025
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:09,565

1029
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:29,514
and Harold Arthur.

1030
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,392
I would like for you to meet
our friends on the dais.

1031
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:38,866
- Hold your applause until I'm finished.
- More coffee?

1032
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,062
- Kitty Domaine, Selby Desner.
- There you go.

1033
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:45,039
Barbara Wattell,
Walter Smith...

1034
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:48,406
Martha Sterling
and Paul Fleming.

1035
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:51,605
And to my right,
Michael Kenyon...

1036
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:54,512
Olivia D. Williams...

1037
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:56,448
Otto Bailey...

1038
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:58,248
Bea Dorfman.

1039
01:05:58,321 --> 01:05:59,879
And now...

1040
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:04,017
the Father of
Internal Bushings...

1041
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:06,687
our very own
and beloved leader...

1042
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:09,253
A man who needs
no introduction!

1043
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:10,492
Thank you very much, Sammy.

1044
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:11,999
I couldn't wait.

1045
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:14,866
That was a very nice introduction,
and I am...

1046
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:17,872
very thrilled
and proud to be here.

1047
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:21,398
Is been a wonderful ceremony
here on behalf of our own Fred...

1048
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,877
The Dorf Dorfman!

1049
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:29,851
- Who is he?
- Fred was darn near death recently.

1050
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:32,752
He wasn't ashamed to admit to me
that he had syphilis.

1051
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:36,849
Thank God he stopped it
in its tracks.

1052
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:40,756
It takes a lot for a man...

1053
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:45,194
to admit where he got it from
and how he got it.

1054
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:48,100
Look at him today.
Fred, you look just wonderful.

1055
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,503
The nose looks normal again.
The face has come back into shape.

1056
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:54,168
Is not drooling anymore.

1057
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:57,838
And hats off to Marge, his wife,
because that whole experience...

1058
01:06:57,913 --> 01:07:01,349
the three weeks that she stayed
at Trembling Hills has paid off.

1059
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:04,682
No more alcohol
or sedatives in her life.

1060
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:07,484
There are many other things
I wanna tell you about Fred...

1061
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:11,117
things that maybe many of you
already know.

1062
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:14,492
Sammy, you're not going
to sing for us, are you?

1063
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:18,693
Did you know that Fred
spent much of his life...

1064
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:23,296
honoring a profession that has gone
largely unsung around here?

1065
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:27,206
Some of them are here tonight.
The profession is law enforcement.

1066
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:31,269
I know Fred feels that too often
our feelings are locked in...

1067
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:33,815
and we feel restrained
and perhaps even embarrassed...

1068
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,443
to reach out and touch
an officer of the law.

1069
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:39,113
After all, they are people,
aren't they?

1070
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:42,919
Stand up. Pat them on the back.
Reach out.

1071
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:46,450
Shake hands with any one
of these men in blue.

1072
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:48,997
Hug a cop!
Yeah, go ahead. I said it.

1073
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,794
Yeah!
Thas a wonderful feeling!

1074
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,857
I'm so proud tonight!

1075
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:57,668
# Oh, say can you see #

1076
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:03,269
# By the dawn's
early light #

1077
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:07,748
# What so proudly we hail #

1078
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:10,183
# At the twilighs
last gleaming ##

1079
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,981
Hip, hip, hooray!

1080
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:13,919
Hooray!
Hooray!

1081
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,320
Hooray!
Hooray!

1082
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:26,331
Mr. Stanwyk,
you are confirmed on Flight 441...

1083
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:29,633
to Rio de Janeiro tomorrow evening,
11 p.m., first class.

1084
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:31,935
Thas terrific.
Thank you.

1085
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:34,532
- You reconfirmed this morning.
- You bet I did.

1086
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,601
I'm a bear for detail.

1087
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,943
I hope there's nobody
sitting next to me.

1088
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:42,814
I always travel first class,
and I take both seats up.

1089
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:45,786
I'm in bridge work.
Bridge construction.

1090
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:49,291
These fold-outs
take a lot of space.

1091
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:51,223
There is someone
next to you.

1092
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:55,992
Oh, for God don don!
Who is it? Mr. Singleton?

1093
01:08:57,333 --> 01:09:00,894
- No. The name is Cavanaugh.
- Cavanaugh?

1094
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,369
Ah! Morris or Pierre?

1095
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,966
Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

1096
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,168
Sally Ann?
Well, terrific.

1097
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:11,077
In fact, you purchased
the ticket for Miss Cavanaugh.

1098
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,945
Doesn't mean I want her
sitting next to me.

1099
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:18,584
The flighs full.
She's connecting out of Provo.

1100
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,815
Oh. All right, fine.

1101
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:24,018
Provo, Spain?

1102
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:25,754
Utah.

1103
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:26,988
Utah.

1104
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:30,828
Frank, don't give me crap
about the beach story.

1105
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,664
- I'm at the airport.
- [Frank] The airport?

1106
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:36,000
There are two dozen cops
after my ass.

1107
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:39,632
I can't go home or to the office.
I'm a man without a country.

1108
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:43,439
If cops are really after you,
come in here. You'll be OK.

1109
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:46,515
I couldn't
get through the front door.

1110
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:48,277
I'm going to Utah.

1111
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,818
You go to Utah,
you stay in Utah.

1112
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:54,287
I'm turning the story over
to a professional reporter.

1113
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:57,018
The story is Utah.
Trust me.

1114
01:09:57,092 --> 01:10:00,118
You're going to Utah?
Fine.

1115
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:03,222
If you're story is not on my desk
by 11:30, you're fired.

1116
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:33,986
Cujo?

1117
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:50,396
Who the hell are you?

1118
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:52,093
Get up!

1119
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:53,759
I'm up.

1120
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,869
- Door was unlocked.
- Lock's busted.

1121
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,271
There you have it.

1122
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,943
I work for the landlord.

1123
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:05,741
He told me to watch out
for the place.

1124
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:08,715
- I commend him on his choice.
- What?

1125
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:10,684
I commend him
on his choice.

1126
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:15,481
I was supposed to meet
Mrs. Cavanaugh here.

1127
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:16,717
Who are you?

1128
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:20,284
I'm Don Corleone,
Mrs. Cavanaugh's cousin.

1129
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,387
You know where she is?

1130
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:23,863
Moved out.

1131
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:28,028
Moved out?
Isn't that something.

1132
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:31,072
I talked to her last week.
She didn't say a thing about it.

1133
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,404
- She moved out.
- You're saying she moved out.

1134
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:36,808
- This morning.
- This morning?

1135
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:40,280
God! Uh. We had
so much to talk about.

1136
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:43,708
Mo Green is out
of the Tropicana.

1137
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:46,254
My sons, Mike and Fredo,
are taking over.

1138
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:49,347
What did you
want under the bed?

1139
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:56,294
I have to pull rank on you.
I didn't want to have to do this.

1140
01:13:56,365 --> 01:14:00,358
I'm with the mattress police.
There are no tags on these mattresses.

1141
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:04,504
I'm taking you downtown.
Give me the weapon.

1142
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,936
I'm calling the cops.

1143
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:11,605
- This is for the cops.
- Come on, man. I'm her cousin.

1144
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,045
Tell the cops.

1145
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:20,481
OK. You wanna call the cops,
call the cops.

1146
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:23,955
Better tie
your shoelaces first.

1147
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:47,370
Thanks a lot!

1148
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:57,892
Stretch, whas happening?

1149
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,793
- Got an unbelievable story here.
- Yeah? Great.

1150
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:03,297
- What can I do?
- Write this down. Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

1151
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,333
Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

1152
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,267
Check every hotel in L.A.
Start near the airport.

1153
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,567
He's supposed to leave the country
with her tomorrow night.

1154
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,197
Got that, honey?

1155
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:14,333
I love your body, Larry.

1156
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:18,607
[Pigs Grunting, Squealing]

1157
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,591
Good afternoon.

1158
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:35,562
Howdy.

1159
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:37,656
They should
recall these things.

1160
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:41,328
Hit one bump
and the window explodes.

1161
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:42,961
You're Marvin Stanwyk?

1162
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,505
- Yeah.
- Hi there.

1163
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:47,201
Harry S. Truman,
Casewell Insurance underwriters.

1164
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:48,709
Harry S. Truman?

1165
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:51,940
My parents were fans
of the former president.

1166
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:54,676
Isn't that nice.
He was a good man.

1167
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:57,150
- He sure was.
- He showed the Japs a thing or two.

1168
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:00,245
- Dropped the big one, huh?
- He dropped two big ones on them.

1169
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:02,381
- He was a real fighter.
- Yeah.

1170
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:05,187
You're in insurance, Harry?

1171
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,921
Thas right.

1172
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:10,522
- Well, I'm fully covered.
- I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk.

1173
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:14,160
Actually, my company
sub-insures a policy...

1174
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:17,672
held by Alan Stanwyk,
who I believe is your son.

1175
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,104
Yeah, he is.

1176
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:21,665
Mr. Truman,
meet my wife Velma.

1177
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:23,574
- My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

1178
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:26,409
Sit down and have
a glass of lemonade.

1179
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:29,917
- Thank you.
- Velma makes the most unusual lemonade.

1180
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:33,182
Is hard to keep it cold
on a day like this.

1181
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:37,125
Where you from, Harry?

1182
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,387
I'm from California.

1183
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:42,396
San Berdoo.

1184
01:16:42,464 --> 01:16:45,331
Yeah. Utah is
part of my route.

1185
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:51,138
You folks don't mind if I ask you
a couple of questions, do you?

1186
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:53,640
- Shoot.
- Thank you very much.

1187
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:56,200
We'll start with
some routine things.

1188
01:16:57,846 --> 01:17:00,679
You and your wife
are currently alive, I take it?

1189
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:04,710
- Harry, if there's...
- Is just regulations.

1190
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:10,485
Now, you, Marvin,
and your wife named Velma...

1191
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:15,462
are the parents of one Alan Stanwyk
of Beverly Hills...

1192
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:17,725
Executive Vice President
of Boyd Aviation.

1193
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,664
- [Marvin] Check.
- Check.

1194
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:21,828
And when did you last see Alan?

1195
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:25,139
Oh... uh...

1196
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:26,731
about 10 days ago.

1197
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,241
10 days ago?

1198
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:31,871
He comes and visits
about every three weeks.

1199
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:36,915
Isn't that nice.
How long has he done that?

1200
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:38,680
Since he moved to L.A.

1201
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:48,891
Pardon me if I seem a bit personal here.
I don't know how to put it.

1202
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:54,231
We understand that there's
a young lady friend in Provo...

1203
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:56,099
that Alan's been seeing.

1204
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:58,230
Whas this got to do
with insurance?

1205
01:17:58,306 --> 01:18:00,740
This is a comprehensive policy.

1206
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:03,209
Forget about
that lady friend business.

1207
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:06,042
Alan is
a loving husband.

1208
01:18:06,114 --> 01:18:08,105
He dotes on his bride.

1209
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:09,616
Who?

1210
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,380
His wife.

1211
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:15,189
You've met her?

1212
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:17,851
Of course we have.
He brings her with him.

1213
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:25,127
Has Alan ever mentioned
the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh?

1214
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,729
Has he?

1215
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:34,073
Boy, what in the hell's
the matter with you?

1216
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:36,406
- He has.
- Of course he has.

1217
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:37,809
Thas his wife.

1218
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,072
Of course.

1219
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:43,743
His wife's name
is Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

1220
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:46,845
Cute as a button.

1221
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:49,891
You wouldn't have
a picture of them, would you?

1222
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:52,119
We've got lots of pictures.

1223
01:18:52,194 --> 01:18:54,321
- Let me get you some.
- Great.

1224
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:58,357
Still married are they,
Alan and Sally Ann?

1225
01:18:58,433 --> 01:18:59,798
Yes, they are.

1226
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:01,927
How long have
they been married?

1227
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:05,962
It was before
he moved to L.A.

1228
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:08,032
Eight years April.

1229
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,237
This gets heavier
each year.

1230
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:13,770
There we are.
Here it is.

1231
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:16,113
- Thas the one.
- Oh, my goodness.

1232
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:18,482
She is a button,
isn't she?

1233
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:20,111
Isn't she cute?

1234
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:23,749
Could I borrow this picture?
I promise to send it back.

1235
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:27,727
- Is routine. The actuarial people...
- Thas all right. We have more.

1236
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:30,890
- Want to see the reception?
- No, thank you. I'm trying to quit.

1237
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:33,025
How about Marvin's
65th birthday party?

1238
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:36,195
- How about that, Marvin?
- They got a picture of me in here.

1239
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:41,202
This is Alan?
I can't believe this!

1240
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,642
Is really Alan,
and is really bigamy.

1241
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:46,772
- How long have they been married?
- About eight years.

1242
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:47,974
Who is this woman?

1243
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:51,678
I think is Alan's
high school sweetheart.

1244
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,619
Sally Ann something or other.

1245
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:58,893
Alan's been keeping
many secrets lately.

1246
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,552
I'm calling the police.

1247
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,119
No, Gail, don't.

1248
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:05,462
- I'm calling my father.
- Give me one more day.

1249
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:09,368
Why? Do you have any idea
how humiliating this is?

1250
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:11,564
Yes, I do.
I really do.

1251
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:17,474
Remember what I told you?
Tomorrow night you have a club meeting.

1252
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:20,515
Stay away from the house.
I'll take care of him.

1253
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:22,641
- Don't worry.
- She looks like a hooker.

1254
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:26,016
Look at her. Could you love
someone who looked like that?

1255
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:28,078
What are you talking about?
Of course not.

1256
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:32,356
5, 10 minutes tops,
maybe.

1257
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:35,252
Is funny.

1258
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,227
I know. Listen.

1259
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:44,102
Why don't we relax and lie down
and I'll fill you in.

1260
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:50,569
This is a good time
to make a pass at me.

1261
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:23,477
- Gum?
- Who? Go somewhere else.

1262
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,604
Gum, is me.

1263
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:30,247
- Fletch. Really, is that you?
- Shut up. Don't say my name.

1264
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:33,310
Shut up. Don't look at me.
I gotta talk to you.

1265
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,583
All right. About what?

1266
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,725
There are cops all around here.
They're after me.

1267
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:42,922
- You mean those surfers over there?
- Lay back down.

1268
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:45,728
- Don't point. Just lay back.
- OK.

1269
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,201
- Why they after you?
- I'm a newspaper reporter.

1270
01:21:49,271 --> 01:21:52,138
I'm nailing Chief Karlin as
the major drug source on this beach.

1271
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:56,834
Sit back.

1272
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,939
Fat Sam's turning
State's evidence.

1273
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:02,506
Whas that?

1274
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:05,609
He wrote me
a nice deposition.

1275
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:07,678
Said he received the drugs
and you did the selling.

1276
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:11,248
He said what?
Fletch, he's lying.

1277
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:14,386
I didn't sell nothing.
You gotta believe me.

1278
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:17,454
I just carried the drugs
from the chief to Sam.

1279
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:20,968
- Sure you did, Gum.
- Honest, man. Thas all I did.

1280
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:25,666
20 years in prison, Gum.
Unless you want to play ball.

1281
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,602
You don't leave me
much choice.

1282
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:37,975
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1283
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:41,511
These robes...
I got another question.

1284
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:44,251
Where does the chief
get his drugs?

1285
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:45,657
I don't know.

1286
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:49,954
Have fun.
Don't bend over for the soap.

1287
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:51,464
Fletch.
Fletch, OK.

1288
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,960
Is somewhere
in South America.

1289
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:02,943
Mind if I sit here?

1290
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:04,410
Fletch?

1291
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:06,071
Man...
[Laughing]

1292
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,980
- You don't know me, Sam.
- My pleasure, brother.

1293
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:10,915
I'm a reporter, Sam.

1294
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:14,478
I'm breaking the story
on the drug traffic around here.

1295
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:16,251
Gummy's turning
State's evidence.

1296
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,690
I got good proof
is the chief.

1297
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,751
You gonna bust the chief?

1298
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,592
Gonna bust the chief.

1299
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:26,757
I could use your help.

1300
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:32,596
I'm a slave to that
son of a bitch.

1301
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,904
He busted me,
third offense.

1302
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:39,538
Said push for him or do 15 long.
All I get from this is free junk.

1303
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:42,344
- You don't have a piece of the action?
- No. Free junk, thas it.

1304
01:23:48,156 --> 01:23:49,851
Hey, how you doing?

1305
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:53,087
Albert Einstein's forehead.
You like it? Won it in a raffle.

1306
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:55,391
Fellas, stay with me.

1307
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:57,556
Fletch?

1308
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,065
Whas up?

1309
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:02,296
- I'm quitting at midnight.
- Who are they?

1310
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:05,339
This is Fat Sam and Gummy.
Come with me.

1311
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,398
Their statements
name Chief Karlin...

1312
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:10,103
as the number one drug pusher
from here to Oxnard.

1313
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:12,976
I want them to have Federal protection
sponsored by the paper. OK?

1314
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:19,879
- This is wonderful.
- I'm out, Frank.

1315
01:24:19,954 --> 01:24:23,014
- You lost faith in me.
- Fletch, I got nervous.

1316
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:25,286
Forget it.
I'm writing the story.

1317
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,726
Hold the last two paragraphs
till 10:00.

1318
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:30,264
You want an apology?

1319
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:32,925
- You were going to can me, right?
- No, not really.

1320
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:36,459
- Not really?
- I was upset. You know.

1321
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:42,471
OK. Jesus,
I'm sick of this place.

1322
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:43,636
Ow.

1323
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:47,408
I'll try out for the Lakers.
They need a power forward.

1324
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:50,246
This is a hell of a story.

1325
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:51,342
Thanks.

1326
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:53,580
- About these guys...
- They're fine.

1327
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:56,783
You don't have valuables
in there, do you?

1328
01:27:13,761 --> 01:27:15,285
Good evening.

1329
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:24,330
I like your outfit.

1330
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:26,396
Did you bring the 50 grand
and the tickets?

1331
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:28,408
Of course.

1332
01:27:28,476 --> 01:27:31,673
Oh, oh, oh. You forgot
your rubber gloves.

1333
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:34,237
You're planning
on killing me, aren't you?

1334
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:39,145
You catch on real quick,
Mr. Nugent.

1335
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:41,347
Thas a hostile thing to do.

1336
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:45,552
You were gonna kill me.
I look at this as self-defense.

1337
01:27:45,627 --> 01:27:49,654
Now, if you would be so kind
as to put your passport on my desk.

1338
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:56,363
You're wearing my suit.
Where did you get that?

1339
01:27:57,772 --> 01:28:00,764
Where did you get my suit,
Mr. Nugent?

1340
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:03,640
The name's Fletcher.
I'm a newspaper reporter.

1341
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:05,804
I write a column
under the name Jane Doe.

1342
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:09,372
- What is this?
- Read this.

1343
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:12,078
- I don't have time...
- Cut the crap.

1344
01:28:12,153 --> 01:28:14,144
Come read this.
I'm not going anywhere.

1345
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:30,537
Unless my people hear differently,
that letter goes out at midnight.

1346
01:28:39,514 --> 01:28:40,981
Dear Mr. Boyd:

1347
01:28:41,049 --> 01:28:43,108
Alan Stanwyk
murdered me tonight.

1348
01:28:46,621 --> 01:28:49,488
Charred remains found in the Jaguar
are mine, not his.

1349
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:52,717
Mr. Stanwyk,
using my name and passport...

1350
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:54,921
boarded Pan Am Flight 306.

1351
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,021
- On arrival, he intends..."
- Pretty hefty.

1352
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,827
Keep reading.

1353
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:03,393
...with his legal wife...

1354
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:05,496
the former
Sally Ann Cavanaugh..."

1355
01:29:05,573 --> 01:29:07,131
Don't stop, Alan.

1356
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:15,206
- Uh-oh. The missus.
- What are you doing here?

1357
01:29:15,283 --> 01:29:18,047
I know most of it. I want
to hear the rest from you.

1358
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:22,781
He doesn't read my stuff very well.
Let me take a crack at it.

1359
01:29:22,857 --> 01:29:26,054
Sally Ann and Alan
were married eight years ago...

1360
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:31,430
never divorced, making Stanwyk
a bigamist, even in Utah.

1361
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:35,263
Stanwyk is traveling
with $3 million in cash...

1362
01:29:35,336 --> 01:29:38,601
the result of Gail Stanwyk's
conversion of Boyd Aviation stock."

1363
01:29:43,745 --> 01:29:45,576
Is true, isn't it?

1364
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:47,580
Sally Ann
can confirm this...

1365
01:29:47,648 --> 01:29:49,639
when the police pick her up
at the Airport Marriott."

1366
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:51,582
Isn't that where she is?

1367
01:29:53,254 --> 01:29:55,950
By the way,
Alan is a big drug smuggler.

1368
01:29:56,023 --> 01:29:59,459
But you can read about that
in tomorrow's paper.

1369
01:30:00,294 --> 01:30:02,728
Sincerely, I.M. Fletcher.
P.S. Have a nice day."

1370
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:06,131
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
Bravo.

1371
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:09,966
What tipped me was something your wife
said while we were in bed together.

1372
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:17,473
Oh?
And what was that?

1373
01:30:17,545 --> 01:30:21,037
She said we had roughly
the same build.

1374
01:30:21,115 --> 01:30:23,140
From the waist up,
I imagine.

1375
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:27,219
Then I figured it.

1376
01:30:27,288 --> 01:30:29,381
You bump me off,
plop me in the car...

1377
01:30:29,457 --> 01:30:30,947
and burn me up.

1378
01:30:32,894 --> 01:30:35,454
What the heck,
same bone structure.

1379
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:37,088
You son of a bitch.

1380
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:40,066
But I'm not a stupid
son of a bitch.

1381
01:30:40,134 --> 01:30:42,694
I was prepared to commit
one murder, assface.

1382
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:46,206
What makes you think
I won't commit two?

1383
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:49,175
- Whoops.
- What do you mean, Whoops?

1384
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:51,837
By the time your story's published,
I'll be on the beach.

1385
01:30:51,913 --> 01:30:55,679
I understand extradition
from South America's complicated.

1386
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,775
For two murders,
is even more so.

1387
01:30:58,853 --> 01:31:01,117
That thing loaded?

1388
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:02,656
If you shoot me...

1389
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:04,884
you're liable to lose
those humanitarian awards.

1390
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:06,654
Tough shit, Hopalong.

1391
01:31:06,727 --> 01:31:07,989
Greetings, everyone.

1392
01:31:09,864 --> 01:31:11,729
Thank God, the police.

1393
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:14,267
What are you doing here?

1394
01:31:14,335 --> 01:31:16,963
Put the gun down.
I can take care of them.

1395
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:20,030
Thought you had this figured out.
Nice going, Erwin.

1396
01:31:20,107 --> 01:31:22,371
Don't ever
call me Erwin.

1397
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:25,037
Fat Sam and Gummy
left the beach today.

1398
01:31:25,112 --> 01:31:30,243
It occurred to me that maybe there are
things happening I should be aware of.

1399
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:33,651
I'll take care of this.
It doesn't involve you. Go home.

1400
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:35,655
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- What? Long distance?

1401
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:39,149
Overheard you say something
about South American extradition.

1402
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:43,755
Are you taking that $800,000
I staked you with on the next load?

1403
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:45,890
You two have a lot
to talk over.

1404
01:31:45,967 --> 01:31:48,993
We'll just catch the last
ten minutes of Dynasty.

1405
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,265
[Alan] Jerry,
you're gonna have to trust me!

1406
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:54,502
I got a way to get rid of this asshole,
and you're jeopardizing everything!

1407
01:31:54,575 --> 01:31:56,668
Your way is gonna land my butt
on the front page...

1408
01:31:56,744 --> 01:31:58,507
while you're basking
in the sun!

1409
01:31:58,579 --> 01:32:00,171
With your money.

1410
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:18,023
The second one's
going to be more fun.

1411
01:32:18,099 --> 01:32:19,964
Go ahead, make my day.

1412
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:46,887
Thanks.

1413
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:50,160
No, this is getting absurd.

1414
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:53,064
One Bob Haldeman wig,
a gorilla suit.

1415
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:55,068
- A gibbon suit.
- Tennis shorts.

1416
01:32:55,136 --> 01:32:56,831
leather sneakers,
wrist bands."

1417
01:32:56,904 --> 01:32:59,566
- Is business. I hate tennis.
- Whas novelty teeth?

1418
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,939
Frank, is all business.

1419
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:05,103
A nun's habit.
Six tubes of Crazy Glue.

1420
01:33:05,179 --> 01:33:06,771
Thas personal.

1421
01:33:06,847 --> 01:33:10,010
- Take it out of my raise.
- You're not getting a raise. Come on.

1422
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:13,850
I would think the D.A. would need
these tickets for evidence.

1423
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:15,115
Not necessarily.

1424
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:17,419
- Not necessarily?
- Larry!

1425
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,789
In the court ruling
U.S. vs. Fishbein...

1426
01:33:21,862 --> 01:33:24,422
a man subjected to
potential incineration...

1427
01:33:24,498 --> 01:33:26,329
while wearing
another man's suit...

1428
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,425
is entitled to $10,000 worth
of airline tickets.

1429
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:32,099
Is an obscure ruling
but very important one to me.

1430
01:33:32,173 --> 01:33:36,371
Why don't you say that you want
to take me to Rio with you?

1431
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:39,675
There's a different slant.

1432
01:33:41,682 --> 01:33:43,946
The thing is, we haven't
really dated formally.

1433
01:33:44,018 --> 01:33:46,009
I take first dates
to Laker games.

1434
01:33:46,087 --> 01:33:49,215
I don't want to go
to a Laker game.

1435
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:50,552
I don't like basketball.

1436
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:53,389
Maybe thas because
you don't understand basketball.

1437
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:56,157
You haven't learned the fundamentals.
The pick and roll.

1438
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:58,164
Sounds like a fast-food chain.

1439
01:33:58,232 --> 01:34:00,223
- Reverse stuff.
- That I've done.

1440
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:02,394
I'll bet you have,
you little vixen.

1441
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,734
[Fletch] The coroner
had certified Stanwyk dead...

1442
01:34:04,805 --> 01:34:06,966
or extremely sleepy.

1443
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:10,670
And Chief Karlin was facing
20 years in the fun house.

1444
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:12,736
I decided
to accompany Gail to Rio...

1445
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:15,611
and personally assist her
in her grief therapy.

1446
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:19,278
On the beach, I explained basketball
to her, but she didn't grasp it.

1447
01:34:19,353 --> 01:34:21,480
- Fletch?
- Call me Erwin.

1448
01:34:21,555 --> 01:34:24,547
[Gail Laughs]

1449
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:26,889
Why do they bounce
the ball the whole time?

1450
01:34:26,961 --> 01:34:29,623
Doesn't it seem
a little childish?

1451
01:34:29,697 --> 01:34:31,995
Well, it may seem that,
but thas called dribbling.

1452
01:34:32,066 --> 01:34:34,626
- Dribbling?
- If they stop bouncing the ball...

1453
01:34:34,702 --> 01:34:36,431
they get called for traveling.

1454
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:38,734
Traveling. Aha.

1455
01:34:38,806 --> 01:34:41,001
Thas what they call it
when you don't bounce the ball.

1456
01:34:41,075 --> 01:34:43,703
When it came to basketball,
Gail was a loss.

1457
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:45,769
But we had our own version
of one-on-one...

1458
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:49,475
and she thought I was the bravest man
in the world, which I am.

1459
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:53,145
By the way, I charged the vacation to
Mr. Underhill's American Express card.

1460
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,551
Want the number?

1461
