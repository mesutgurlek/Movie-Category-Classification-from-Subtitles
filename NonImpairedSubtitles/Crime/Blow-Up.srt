1
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,892
- So long. We'll see you again.
- Goodbye.

2
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:49,275
Give me your money. Do it.

3
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:54,477
- Splendid.
- Thank you.

4
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:20,569
Blue 439.

5
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:26,275
- Blue 439. Over.
- <i>Blue 439, go ahead, please. Over. </i>

6
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:29,179
Phone Weston 0-219.
Tell him I'm on my way, will you?

7
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,116
<i>Roger Wilco. Stand by. </i>

8
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:10,688
- Hello, love.
- Hello.

9
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:35,977
- Get that stuff developed, will you?
- Yeah.

10
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:37,915
Right away.

11
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:54,427
Here I am.

12
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:01,073
Ready?

13
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:06,577
- I've been ready for nearly an hour.
- Good.

14
00:06:06,749 --> 00:06:09,513
I'm catching a plane for Paris
at 11, so I can't...

15
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:11,585
Can't what?

16
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:14,246
It doesn't matter.

17
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:23,163
Who the hell were you with last night?

18
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:26,501
Reg.

19
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,666
Reg, leùs have some noise, can we?

20
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,651
Right.

21
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:22,584
Thaùs good. Thaùs good.
Hold that.

22
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:58,055
Reg.

23
00:08:09,805 --> 00:08:12,968
Give it to me now.
Come on. Thaùs good.

24
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,508
Hunch. Hunch more.

25
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,875
Thaùs it. Thaùs good.

26
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:25,420
Thaùs good. And the hair back.
And the hair back.

27
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:29,258
Thaùs great. Thaùs great!
Thaùs good. More of that.

28
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,223
Now give it to me. Really give it to me.
Come on, now.

29
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,994
As fast as you can, give it to me.
Come on, right forward.

30
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,932
Thaùs good. This side. This side.
Lean right forward. Hand up.

31
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,038
Thaùs great. Just touch the face.
Thaùs very good.

32
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:47,438
And again around this way.
Touch the face again.

33
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,306
Good. Now the hair.
Marvelous. Thaùs great.

34
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:53,471
Good. Yes, the hair.
Much more. Much more.

35
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:57,312
Good. Yes, thaùs great.
Thaùs good. Yes. And again. And again.

36
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:01,920
Oh, hold that.
Hold the hair back. Again. Good.

37
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:05,122
Okay, Reg, 50.

38
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,786
On your back. On your back. Go on.

39
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,961
Yes. Now really give it to me. Come on.

40
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:16,332
Come on. Work, work, work!

41
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:19,997
Great. Great. And again.
Go on. Back. Back. Arms up.

42
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:22,940
Stretch yourself, little lady. Great.

43
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:25,979
And again. Go on. Go. Go.

44
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:32,053
Thaùs great.

45
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:35,088
Thaùs it. Keep it up. Lovely.

46
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:37,852
Yeah, make it come. Great.

47
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:41,019
No, no, head up. Head up.

48
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,861
Now for me, love. For me.

49
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:48,299
Now! Now! Yes! Yes! Yes!

50
00:10:11,894 --> 00:10:13,555
Hello?

51
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:15,492
Yeah, hold on.

52
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:18,595
Iùs Peter.

53
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:21,327
Hello?

54
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:25,097
Yes.

55
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:27,333
Yes.

56
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,308
Yeah, I've got it somewhere.
I know I have.

57
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:33,708
Yeah, hold on.

58
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:38,081
Reg, take down the address
of that bloody junk shop, would you?

59
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:12,253
Why, they're fabulous. Go on.

60
00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:14,683
Yeah.

61
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:20,052
Yeah. Great.

62
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:23,023
Here. You can burn that lot.

63
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:48,089
Reg!

64
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:52,686
- Get the birds down, will you?
- Okay.

65
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,602
No chewing gum. Get rid of it.

66
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:43,643
And not on my floor.

67
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:46,247
You, arm down.

68
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:48,474
Right.

69
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,978
Six millimeter.

70
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,194
Terrible.

71
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,261
How about the leg
a little further forward?

72
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:08,165
Put the head up.

73
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:22,541
Just go. Mouth open. Yes, good. Good.

74
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:53,140
No, you're all wrong. Start again.
Rethink it. Rethink it.

75
00:13:57,486 --> 00:14:01,354
Stripes, let the dress just fall down.
Keep the stripes straight.

76
00:14:01,524 --> 00:14:03,924
Just let your arms
go up and down.

77
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:08,086
Yes, very tasty. Yes, I like it.
I like it. Go on.

78
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,996
Yeah.

79
00:14:10,165 --> 00:14:12,292
All right, change position.

80
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:17,997
Yep.

81
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:21,373
Wake up!

82
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:27,371
You can thank your lucky stars
you're working with me, can't you?

83
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,450
All right, one more.

84
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:32,710
And leùs smile now. Come on.

85
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:35,080
Smile.

86
00:14:35,257 --> 00:14:37,487
Smile.

87
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,095
God.

88
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,865
I asked you to smile.

89
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,374
Whaùs the matter?

90
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,411
Have you forgotten what a smile is?

91
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,480
Hey?!

92
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,984
All right, you're all tired now.
Go on, relax.

93
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:16,029
I can't see your eyeballs anymore.
They're just slits.

94
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:18,690
Go on.

95
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:21,335
Close your eyes.

96
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,064
Close your eyes.

97
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,644
And stay like that.

98
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:34,045
Iùs good for you.

99
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:53,731
Close your eyes.

100
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:41,673
That must be five or six years old.

101
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:50,485
They don't mean anything
when I do them. Just a mess.

102
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:57,460
Afterwards, I find something
to hang on to, like that...

103
00:16:57,633 --> 00:17:00,067
Quite like that leg.

104
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:08,240
Then it sorts itself out and adds up.

105
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:13,982
Iùs like finding a clue
in a detective story.

106
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:20,011
Don't ask me about this one.
I don't know yet.

107
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,284
- Can I buy it?
- No.

108
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:28,223
Will you give it to me?

109
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,361
There.

110
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:14,633
Tight-faced bastard.

111
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:18,268
He won't float me
one of his crappy paintings.

112
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,552
I'll creep down one night
and knock it off.

113
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:46,331
Don't stop, iùs lovely.

114
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:51,136
You look tired.

115
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:54,541
I've been all night in a doss house.

116
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:29,442
They say they've been
asked to come here.

117
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:34,715
- Not by me.
- Well, we weren't exactly asked.

118
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:38,023
Sorry, I'm busy.

119
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:41,685
They're printing some snaps
for me upstairs. Go and fetch them.

120
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:49,335
Couldn't you give us
just a couple of minutes?

121
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:51,169
A couple of minutes?

122
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,969
I haven't even got a couple of minutes
to have my appendix out.

123
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,104
- Well, when can we come then?
- Don't.

124
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:35,548
- The others still waiting with their eyes shut?
- Yes, they're waiting, but their eyes are open.

125
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:37,446
Good.

126
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,250
Tell them to shut them again.

127
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:53,463
Get rid of that bag. Iùs diabolical.

128
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,502
Can we come back this afternoon?

129
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:51,513
- What do you want?
- Just looking around.

130
00:22:51,686 --> 00:22:54,985
There are no cheap bargains here.
You're wasting your time.

131
00:22:55,157 --> 00:22:57,318
Well, I'll just have a look.

132
00:22:58,994 --> 00:23:01,121
What are you looking for?

133
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:04,629
- Pictures.
- No pictures.

134
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:11,432
What kind of pictures?

135
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:19,308
- Landscapes.
- Sorry, no landscapes.

136
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:31,856
Sold. All sold.

137
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:40,061
- You the owner?
- No, the owner is out.

138
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:44,198
Expecting him?

139
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,764
What are you doing?

140
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:55,066
Stop it! Stop it!

141
00:29:55,243 --> 00:29:58,076
Give me those. You can't
photograph people like that.

142
00:29:58,246 --> 00:30:00,237
Who says I can't?

143
00:30:00,415 --> 00:30:03,384
I'm only doing my job.
Some people are bullfighters...

144
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,519
...some people are politicians.

145
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:07,120
I'm a photographer.

146
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:12,654
This is a public place. Everyone has
the right to be left in peace.

147
00:30:14,162 --> 00:30:17,222
Iùs not my fault if there's no peace.

148
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:21,465
You know, most girls would pay me
to photograph them.

149
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,963
I'll pay you.

150
00:30:25,473 --> 00:30:27,600
I overcharge.

151
00:30:27,775 --> 00:30:30,608
There are other things
I want on the reel.

152
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:45,457
What do we do then?

153
00:30:46,227 --> 00:30:48,525
I send you the photographs.

154
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,925
No, I want them now.

155
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,101
No!

156
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,299
Whaùs the rush?

157
00:31:08,082 --> 00:31:11,210
Don't leùs spoil everything.
We've only just met.

158
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:26,500
No, we haven't met.
You've never seen me.

159
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,170
- Hello.
- Hello.

160
00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:42,971
- My agent saw you about this shop.
- Did he?

161
00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:45,103
He's a man with a cigar.

162
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,304
Throws ash everywhere.

163
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:50,015
I expect I remember him.

164
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,816
I probably asked
for too much money.

165
00:32:53,988 --> 00:32:56,821
Money's always a problem, isn't it?

166
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:01,954
Tell him to come back.

167
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:07,901
Why are you selling?

168
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:16,976
I'd like to try something different.

169
00:33:17,145 --> 00:33:19,010
Get off somewhere.

170
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,115
I'm fed up with antiques.

171
00:33:22,984 --> 00:33:24,713
Get off where?

172
00:33:24,886 --> 00:33:26,444
To Nepal.

173
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,649
Nepal is all antiques.

174
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:32,383
Is it?

175
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:38,361
Perhaps I better try Morocco.

176
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,371
- How much?
- What?

177
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:51,603
The propeller.

178
00:33:54,482 --> 00:33:56,245
You can have it for...

179
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:58,783
...8 pounds.
- Right. You're in business.

180
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,717
- Have you got a van?
- You can't take it now.

181
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:03,516
I must.

182
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:04,953
I must.

183
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,117
- I can't live without it.
- Hard luck.

184
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:11,231
Thaùll teach you to fall in love
with heavy things on Saturday mornings.

185
00:34:22,276 --> 00:34:25,177
- Is that it?
- Thaùs it.

186
00:34:29,951 --> 00:34:33,079
You can't treat it like that.
Iùs not a delivery van.

187
00:34:33,254 --> 00:34:36,121
- Who cares?
- Leave it to me.

188
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,520
Something will turn up.

189
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,254
Yes. All right, but it
better turn up today.

190
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,407
Blue 439. Blue 439. Over.

191
00:35:33,948 --> 00:35:37,179
<i>439, go ahead, please. Over. </i>

192
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:39,043
Hello, this is...

193
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,350
Get me Flaxton 2-249.
Mr. Walker. Mr. Peter Walker.

194
00:35:43,524 --> 00:35:47,221
Tell him I saw the junk shop.
Iùs pricey, but the kid will come down.

195
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,829
Let him ring her right away, then...

196
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,495
...nobody else will get it.

197
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,268
<i>Roger Wilco. Stand by. </i>

198
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:05,036
<i>Blue 439. Blue 439. Over. </i>

199
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:07,681
Blue 439. Blue 439. Go ahead, echo.

200
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:11,808
<i>Blue 439, message passed. The number</i>
<i>stored. Your caller doesn't like it. </i>

201
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:14,147
Tell him to get stuffed.

202
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:17,189
What about all the buildings
going up around the place?

203
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,089
Already there are queers
and poodles in the area.

204
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:24,520
I saw some in the couple
of minutes I was there.

205
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:29,864
- Iùll go like a bomb. Over.
- <i>Blue 439. What is in the area? Over. </i>

206
00:36:30,037 --> 00:36:34,133
- Forget it. Over.
- <i>Roger Wilco. Standing by. </i>

207
00:37:01,335 --> 00:37:03,360
You want to use the lot?

208
00:37:14,582 --> 00:37:16,550
Don't you like them?

209
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:18,718
They're great.

210
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,918
We'll use three or four.

211
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:29,195
Spread through the book?

212
00:37:29,931 --> 00:37:32,092
No. All together.

213
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,233
Yeah.

214
00:37:38,272 --> 00:37:41,002
- And a pint.
- Yes, sir.

215
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,174
Which one last?

216
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,109
None of this lot.
I've got something fab for the end.

217
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:51,115
In a park. I only took them this morning.
You'll get them later today.

218
00:37:51,285 --> 00:37:54,618
Iùs very peaceful, very still.

219
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:59,289
And the rest of the book will be pretty
violent, so iùs best to end it like that.

220
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:00,892
Yes.

221
00:38:01,062 --> 00:38:02,962
Thaùs best.

222
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:05,524
Rings truer.

223
00:38:20,247 --> 00:38:22,545
I'm going off London this week.

224
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,412
Why?

225
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,952
It doesn't do anything for me.

226
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:32,989
Yeah.

227
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,220
- I've knocked up a few captions.
- Yeah?

228
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:49,973
I'm fed up with those bloody bitches.

229
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:52,738
I wish I had tons of money.

230
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,881
Then I'd be free.

231
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,141
Free to do what?

232
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,476
Free like him?

233
00:39:09,196 --> 00:39:10,993
Someone we know?

234
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:53,127
Thaùll be all right.

235
00:42:23,991 --> 00:42:28,724
Hello. Could you get me Frobershire 3-229,
please? I've only got a sixpence.

236
00:42:30,164 --> 00:42:32,462
Park 1296.

237
00:42:39,173 --> 00:42:40,936
Hello. Iùs me.

238
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:45,339
Weren't you supposed to be
going off to Hurley?

239
00:42:48,382 --> 00:42:52,944
Listen, stay where you are.
Call me soon at home.

240
00:43:08,802 --> 00:43:10,099
I've come...

241
00:43:10,271 --> 00:43:12,603
I've come for the photographs.

242
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:16,673
How did you manage to find me?

243
00:43:18,912 --> 00:43:21,039
Do you live here?

244
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,729
Drink?

245
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,939
Whaùs so important
about my bloody pictures?

246
00:44:30,184 --> 00:44:32,311
Thaùs my business.

247
00:44:44,498 --> 00:44:47,524
The light was very beautiful
in the park this morning.

248
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:49,999
Those shots should be very good.

249
00:44:50,838 --> 00:44:52,601
Anyway, I need them.

250
00:44:57,244 --> 00:45:01,681
My private life's already in a mess.
It would be a disaster if...

251
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:05,341
So what?

252
00:45:07,154 --> 00:45:10,612
Nothing like a little disaster
for sorting things out.

253
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,133
Have you ever done any modeling?

254
00:45:23,504 --> 00:45:26,029
Fashion stuff, I mean.

255
00:45:26,874 --> 00:45:28,865
You've got it.

256
00:45:47,961 --> 00:45:49,861
Hold that.

257
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:56,460
Not many girls can stand
as well as that.

258
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:59,438
No, thanks. I'm in a hurry.

259
00:46:01,542 --> 00:46:03,669
You'll get your pictures.

260
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,277
I promise.

261
00:46:05,446 --> 00:46:07,846
I always keep my word.

262
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,646
Come here.

263
00:46:12,453 --> 00:46:14,387
Show me how you sit.

264
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:46,183
Who is it?

265
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:51,487
Oh, yes. Thaùs right. Hold on a second.

266
00:46:54,695 --> 00:46:56,663
Is it for me?

267
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,362
Iùs my wife.

268
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,535
Why should I speak to her?

269
00:47:11,645 --> 00:47:14,842
Sorry, love.
The bird I'm with won't talk to you.

270
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,648
She isn't my wife, really.
