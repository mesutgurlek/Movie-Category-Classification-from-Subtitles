00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,700
< Nirvana Sutra > Verse 19

2
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,200
The worst of the Eight Hells
is called Continuous Hell

3
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,300
lt has the meaning of Continuous
Suffering. Thus the name

4
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,800
5 years ago

5
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,700
we started valet parking in Tuen Mun

6
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,000
we were full of ambition

7
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,900
But 2 weeks had hardly gone by

8
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,300
and the cops started busting us every day

9
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,700
within one year

10
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,400
6 of our brothers died

11
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,400
Thanks to the Buddha, my life was spared

12
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,400
what thousands must die
so that Caesar may become great

13
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,100
But l don't believe in destiny

14
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,700
The rule of this game
is to take fate in our own hands

15
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,000
You are the newest in my gang

16
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,800
Your records are the cleanest

17
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,700
You can choose your own future

18
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,400
OK

19
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,200
l wish you guys

20
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,500
every success in the police force

21
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,900
Bottoms up, officers

22
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,100
27149, you were here 10 minutes ago

23
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,600
How many files were on my desk?

24
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,100
Six, sir. Four beige ones on the left

25
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,400
one red and one white on the right

26
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,800
what do you think of me?

27
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,300
Sorry, l'm not sure, sir

28
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
But l know you're in a hurry today

29
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,800
'coz your socks don't match

30
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,800
27149, you can go now

31
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes, sir

32
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,700
You owe me $500

33
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,000
OK, but wait till pay day next month

34
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
l told you he would make the best
undercover cop

35
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,700
Now that you're in the cadet school
you should follow the rules

36
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,100
Those who break the rules will be
like him

37
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,400
They will be expelled

38
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,800
who wants to trade place with him?

39
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,900
l do

40
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,600
27149
this is a long-term undercover mission

41
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,900
Your records in the cadet school
will be erased

42
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,800
Only Superintendent wong and
l know of your identity

43
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,700
This mission is highly dangerous
is that clear?

44
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,900
Yes, sir

45
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,800
Sir, l can't stand it any longer

46
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,500
l'm either harassed by cops
or beaten up by gangsters

47
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,100
4927, you are still a rookie

48
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,800
Give me a good reason
why l should promote you

49
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,200
Hang on?
why don't you go hang yourself instead?

50
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,500
l won the Silver whistle Award
at the cadet

51
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,300
and have received numerous kudos as
an officer

52
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,800
l am confident l can lead the police force
sir

53
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Boss

54
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,400
OK, l got it

55
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,900
Move forward

56
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,300
Hurry up

57
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,800
Please go over there to take your mugshot

58
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,100
Ex cuse me

59
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,700
Can l try this stereo?

60
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,600
what speakers are you using?

61
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,200
Nothing special, any recommendations?

62
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,700
Try this tube amplifier
made in Hong Kong, 10,000 only

63
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,300
And use this cable, also locally made
about 1000

64
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,800
The sound is as good as expensive
European amps

65
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,100
Sweet high notes, crisp middle
strong bass

66
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
ln a word, transparent

67
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,400
Come and listen

68
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,900
Human voices are drifting towards you

69
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,600
See that?

70
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,600
Voices are indeed drifting towards you

71
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,100
Try this one

72
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,800
This is ideal for listening to oldies

73
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,900
what do you think?

74
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,400
Much better indeed

75
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,000
Any discount if l buy the whole set?

76
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,900
Buy the tube amp here

77
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,800
but not the speakers

78
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,100
Go to Cheung wai; it's cheaper there

79
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,300
whom should l ask for?

80
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,700
Just tell them Yan sent you

81
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,300
which one is mine?

82
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,200
The one in the middle

83
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,900
Okay, thanks

84
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
You're welcome

85
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
ls Cheung wai open yet?

86
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Sure

87
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,700
You bastard

88
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,000
l told you to watch the store
not to send my customers away

89
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,200
But your speakers are over-priced

90
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,300
lf l don't sell them at this price
how can l afford to pay ''protection money''?

91
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,300
You can try not paying for a change

92
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,200
Hey, the cable

93
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,200
l'll return it in a few days

94
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,600
$4,000 for a few days?

95
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,600
where are you rushing to?

96
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,800
A funeral

97
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,200
Tell me

98
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,700
How many times have you been busted
for assault?

99
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,900
l am trying to convince
the Department of Justice

100
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,300
that you need to see a shrink

101
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,800
But you keep on beating people up

102
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,700
Are you really going nuts?

103
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,900
Have you forgotten you're a cop?

104
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,600
You told me it's only for 3 years

105
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,500
But after 3 years come another 3 years
and another

106
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,100
lt's almost 10 years already, boss

107
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,600
Can't you be a bit more courteous to me?

108
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,500
l'm the only one in Hong Kong
who knows your real identity now

109
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,300
Maybe l'll just erase your file
so you can stick with the Triads for good

110
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,100
what do you want me to do?

111
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,600
Remind myself l'm a cop every day?

112
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,200
Shouting ''Drop your gun, l'm a cop''
even in my dreams?

113
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,200
when will Sam place his order?

114
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
No idea

115
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,200
Sometime this week

116
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,100
what?

117
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,500
Sometime this week

118
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,600
The Thais are here

119
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,800
Once the goods arrive
Sam will resell them

120
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
where is the warehouse?

121
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,900
How the hell do l know?

122
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,800
l started working for him only 3 years ago

123
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,200
OK, l'll let you retire after this

124
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,700
Bullshit
l heard this a zillion times already

125
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,400
Shit. These mikes again?

126
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,700
The Police is loaded with cash
Tell them to get more advanced models

127
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,300
How about implanting it into your body?

128
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,500
lnto which part of my body?

129
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,500
A pinhole camera?

130
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,400
where's the lens?

131
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,600
Your birthday is on the 25th, right?

132
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,200
l never wear watches

133
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,900
lf we got nothing for the lnterpol by 5pm

134
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,300
the counterfeit passport case is off

135
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,700
3:15. Tea time

136
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
what would you like, boss?

137
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,900
Tea with milk, please

138
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,400
They won't talk without their attorney

139
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,600
Has paged their lawyers
but he hasn't called back yet

140
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,400
l won't talk without my attorney

141
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,500
l am Mr. Lau, your attorney

142
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,700
Did you call home?

143
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,200
why should l call home?

144
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,100
lt's good then

145
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,600
where were you last friday
from 3:45 to 5:00 pm?

146
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,600
Brother Mo told me to ask you
if your family needs any help

147
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,700
No need to look around

148
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,500
They won't record anything
when a lawyer is present

149
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,800
lt's not admissible in court anyway

150
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,000
Brother Mo sent you?

151
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,100
Those 2 kids next door

152
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,400
have squealed on the workshop already

153
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,100
Cops are heading there now

154
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,700
Brother Mo told you not to say anything

155
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,000
lf your brother is there
tell him to leave right away

156
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Here

157
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,600
what?

158
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,200
Scram

159
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,600
l ask you to scram, do you hear?

160
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,400
Scram right away

161
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,100
All right. l'll leave you

162
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,500
lf you don't trust me, so be it

163
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,700
Take care

164
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,200
Remember
don't talk without your attorney

165
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,800
l don't need you to tell me that

Hello, yes

No problem. OK

185
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,100
Sorry guys, over time tonight

186
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,100
Our target tonight is a drug trafficking
cartel

00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,700
ln an hour's time
they will be trading with a Thai seller

188
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,600
Cash will be handed over in the building
across the street

189
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,200
in a unit on the 3rd floor

190
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,400
where the goods will be delivered is
still unknown

191
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:10,000
ClB shall tag the target
and tap the phone lines

192
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:16,100
Our unit will not take action till
our mole has pinned down the delivery location

193
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,000
Let's take a look at our principal stars

00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,400
Do you have confidence?

204
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,900

00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,300
Attention. Our prey is in sight

219
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Big Brother

220
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,400
Boss

221
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,300
Take out all your cell phones

222
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,500
You two, go get the car

223
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500

Yes

229
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,800
Did Sam and his gang make any calls?

230
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,200
No. They probably changed their phones

231
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,600
Let's search randomly for calls
made from this area

232
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,000
Searching

233
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,400
Some 6,500 cell phones

234
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,500
are being connected in this area right now

235
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,000
267 cell phones are making calls
on this street alone

236
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,700
Give me 10 minutes

00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,700
Good

238
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,300
Thank you

239
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,900
Did they spot us?

240
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,500
Are those two over there watching us?

241
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,600
which two?

242
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,300
Those two

243
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,100
No one is watching you

244
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,300
Those two making out over there

245
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,100
They are just making out
why would they be watching you?

246
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
You think you're a movie star?

247
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,100
Our prey is back

248
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,400
Yip, watch our prey closely

249
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,600

250
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,800

Very cold

00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,000
You even know how to speak Cantonese

259
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,700
How fantastic

260
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,000

00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,000
Repeat, Helen, Nelson, 397

267
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,600
Should we send a car to tail them?

Lead them in circles

272
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,900
They know which channel we are on

273
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,300
Switch to channel 456855

274
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,500
Boss, where are those two going?

275
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,800
Don't worry, take it easy

276
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Take care of the Thais for me

277
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,200
Sorry, sir

278

Hello?

why don't you use the walkie talkie?
we've switched channels?

280
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,900
Are you done yet?

Keep driving around

285
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,100
Cheung

286
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,700
Use the current channel to tell Elephant
that action has been cancelled

287
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,800
Yes, sir

288
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,800
Elephant, no hunting tonight

289
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,900
Come back to the station

291
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,300

292
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,100
Our guys are freezing to death out there

293
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,600

294

295
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,000
Really?

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,000
Yes. They are bitching at the boss

297
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,900
what are they bitching about?

298
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,900
Those Thais at Lung Koo Bay
are freezing to death

299
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,400
You know they can't stand the cold

300
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,500
That's right

301
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,600
You're sharp

302
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600

307
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,300
A boat is approaching
Probably for checking the goods

308
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,200
The cocaine is all here

309
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,900
Keung, are you an idiot or what?

310
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,200

Tell Keung to shout a loud
that the cocaine is his

313
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,700
Keung, the Boss

00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,400
asks you to shout aloud that the cocaine
is yours

As soon as the Thais step out, arrest them

There's a stooge. Stop the deal

326
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,500
Hello?

327
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,100
Cast all the goods into the sea. Now

328
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,400

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,800
Double Eight, hold it

333

00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,700
Boss. Let's...

336
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,500
Police, don't move

337
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,100
Sam

338
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,700
Your food looks good

339
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Not bad

340
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,800
we've straightened it out

341
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,900
Your boys are only strolling on the beach

342
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
So they can go now?

343
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,000
Sure, any time

344
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,300
we don't want to waste any more of
your precious time

345
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,100
we've known each other for so long
Don't give me that

346
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,300
l haven't had my dinner here
for quite a while

347
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,000
lf you like it, you're always welcome here

348
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,900
How about tomorrow?

349
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,700
l'll take a rain check

350
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,000
l feel bad coming here empty-handed

351
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,400
Don't stand on ceremonies

352
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
l' should feel bad

353
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,400
for making you drop several grand
tonight

354
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,500
You think planting a mole in us will do
us in?

355
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,000
Same here

356
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,500
l remember a story

357
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,200
Two fools are waiting for their
kidney transplants

358
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,600
but only one kidney is available

359
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,000
The two guys thus play a game

360
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,400
They each put a playing card
into the other's pocket

361
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,200
whoever guesses the card in his own
pocket wins

362
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,000
You know l can see your card

363
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,900
l think so too

364
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,900
l will beat you

365
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,200
Let's see

366
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,600
we should be more careful

367
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,700
l will

368
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,000
By the way

369
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,400
whoever loses the game will die

370
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,000
Let's see when you're gonna die

371
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,300
Ever seen someone shakes
a corpse's hand?

372
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,500
Let's go

373
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,800
Put it next to the couch

374
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,700
OK

375
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,900
Thanks

376
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,900
Mary

377
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,900
what's interior designer's number?

378
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,100
The interior designer... 90255047

379
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,600
How many box es have l counted?

380
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,200
24

381
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,000
24? Are you sure?

382
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,400
Positive

383
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,900
Pass me the phone

384
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,200
Coming

385
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,100
Hello?

386
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,200
Hold on please

387
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,200
who is it?

388
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,200
l don't know

389
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,500
Hello

390
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,600
lt's me

391
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,600
Yes, l'm moving in

392
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Don't eavesdrop. lt's confidential

393
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,800
l lost all of my goods

394
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,500
There's a mole

395
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Dig him out for me

396
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,400
Hold on, too many people around here

397
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,500
Hold on

398
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,600
l have no access to those undercover files
l can't dig him out

399
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,300
l don't care how difficult it is

400
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,700
l only know he uses Morse codes

401
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:30,600
Give me all the information on the people
around you last night

402
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,500
Their real names, lD card no.
account no., etc

403
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,400
See you tonight, at the cinema

404
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,500
OK

405
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,100
what's the matter?

406
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,200
29

407
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,700
28

408
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,400
29

409
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,600
l'm talking about my novel

410
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,400
l know what l'm going to write about
Come here

411
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,700
l can write about a man with 28 different
personalities

412
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,100
Are you talking about me?

413
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,700
Be more serious

414
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Think about it

415
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,200
A man with 28 personalities

416
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,300
That means he starts role playing
the minute he wakes up

417
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,000
He is no longer certain
which personality is the real him

418
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
lsn't it scary?

419
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,400
Very much

420
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,800
Good?

421
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,200
Yeah. will be a bestseller for sure

422
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,000
wait...

423
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:22,700
what is it?

424
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,200
why is the ottoman so big?

425
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,600
which one?

426
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,200
l must have gotten the measurements
wrong

427
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,100
Take it easy

428
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,800
You women...

429
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,900
Let me see. Get up slowly

430
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,800
Don't be mad

431
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
Meet up?

432
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,000
You want me dead?

433
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,700
There's a mole in the police station

434
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,300
Dig him out first

435
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,100
So who is he?

436
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,900
l can't talk anymore

437
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,200
what?

438
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,100
Just now?

439
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,800
l was at a Chinese chiropractor

440
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,800
l'm seeing the shrink now

441
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,500
l'm going psycho. That's it

442
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,200
This chair is really... incredible

443
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,100
You should get one for yourself?

444
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,100
So you don't need to come here
and sleep every time

445
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,900
lt's more comfortable here

446
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,600
Don't be so peevish

447
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,300
During these 4 months, if it weren't for me

448
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,400
you wouldn't have the time to play

449
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,900
lt's 5 months
computer games

450
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,700
ln one more month
your mandatory therapy will be over

451
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,500
You can sleep peacefully at home then

452
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,300
So soon?

453
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,200
l don't seem to have improved at all

454
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,300
why don't you just prolong my treatment

455
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Besides, my head is splitting these days

456
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,600
Could it be schizophrenia?

457
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,000
This is called ''headache''
l'll prescribe some Panadol for you

458
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,400
Actually
there's something l want to ask you

459
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,000
but...

460
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,100
it's kind of embarrassing

461
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,800
what do you think of me?

462
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,400
Do you think l'm a good guy or a bad guy?

463
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,300
l hardly know who you are

464
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,200
Tell you a secret, but don't tell anyone

465
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,300
l'm actually a cop

466
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,900
So am l

467
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,300
Let's continue next week

468
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,200
Try to remember your dreams

469
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Of course

470
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,200
l will dream about you

471
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,200
See you next week

472
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,500
Just Panadol?

473
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,400
Bye

474
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,100
Your promotion should be OK

475
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,300
You will be transferred to lnternal Affairs

476
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,500
but you will work at OCTB

477
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,400
l don't understand

478
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,200
l suspect Sam has a mole
in the department

479
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,500
l want you to investigate

480
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,200
why me?

481
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,100
we have scrutinized all possible
candidates

482
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,900
You have an immaculate record

483
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
You have solved many cases in ClB

484
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:44,000
working in lA, you will get in touch
with senior officials

485
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,800
That's a good opportunity

486
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,900
l've arranged for you to appear on TV

487
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,600
Remember to spruce up a bit

488
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,300
when will l meet the Board?

489
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,100
You just did

490
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,500
Come, take a stab

491
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,900
Thanks

492
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,900
By the way

493
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,800
how's the wedding?

494
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,400
Everything's on schedule

495
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,400
That's good

496
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,700
You'll be more stable after marriage

497
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,400
Your image will improve too

498
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,600
You have chance of further promotion

499
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,800
Yes, broaden your horizon

500
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,700
Fill in your real name

501
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,100
This is my real name

502
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,200
You don't know Del Piero is my real name?

503
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,200
ls that so?

504
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,300
Yes

505
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,500
what are you guys writing?

506
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
The Boss told us to fill in these forms

507
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,800
Must be setting up mandatory
provident funds for us

508
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,100
You know, MPF

509
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,100
Are you serious?

510
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,800
You don't know to spell BODYGUARD?

511
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,500
lsn't it supposed to look like this?

512
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,000
Of course not

513
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,400
Should be B-O-D-Y-G-A-R-D

514
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,900
That's it

515
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,900
A shipment will come in next week

516
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,600
They are watching closely

517
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,900
You do what you need to do

518
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,500
l'll handle the rest

519
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,700
The file is open. l'm afraid l can't handle it

520
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,000
So you're not worried about me

521
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,600
You are worried about yourself
lnspector Lau

522
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,600
Those girls are so ugly

523
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,700
l'll take care of it as soon as l can

524
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,700
Hello?

525
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,800
l'm on my way back

526
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,100
Yan

527
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,000
How long have you worked for me?

528
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,200
3 or 4 years already

529
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,900
That long?

530
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,900
Doesn't seem that long to me

531
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,100
l have another shipment next week

532
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,500
But this time

533
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,200
l'm using some tough, new faces

534
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,600
So you guys can rest

535
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,600
Even Keung and the others?

536
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,600
Keung?

537
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,600
Don't you know he's nuts?

538
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,700
There's a mole within us. You know that?

539
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,000
what do you think we should do?

540
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,700
l'll take care of it

541
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,800
How?

542
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,200
l'll find out who he is in a couple of days
Get ready for action

543
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,200
Yan

544
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,800
Of all the brothers, l trust you the most

545
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,300
Lau

546
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,700
No, thanks

547
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,200
These folks

548
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,800
You know most of them
no need for introduction, right?

549
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,300
No, but...

550
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,400
they are so...

551
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,200
who doesn't know you're sent here
to find the mole?

552
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,400
what do you want them to do?
Pour you a cup of coffee?

553
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,900
Only an idiot will not be envied, right?

554
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,900
They all want to know who the mole is

555
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,900
Just tell me whom you want to investigate

556
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,900
OK

557
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,900
Any clues?

558
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,700
Two days ago, my informer

559
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,200
nearly found out who he was

560
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,200
Too bad he lost him

561
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,200
But if Sam is getting a new shipment
he must contact the mole again

562
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,500
Just follow Sam and we'll get
what we want

563
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,600
That's right. l've much to learn from you

564
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Don't say that

565
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,800
Our seniors sent you here
because they think you can do it

566
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,000
Not everyone can handle lA tasks

567
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,100
lt's stuffy here

568
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,500
Let's get out of here

569
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,800
The coffee here is the best
in the headquarters

570
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,900
l'll pour you a cup

571
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,900
My informer nearly found out
who the mole was

572
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,700
But if Sam is getting a new shipment

573
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,800
he must contact the mole again

574
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:58,900
Yes?

575
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,300
Hey

576
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,800
The bed has arrived

577
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,700
ls that so? Comfortable?

578
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,900
You want to try it?

579
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,700
Don't be silly. l have work to do

580
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,200
Think about it

581
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,100
No, l can't

582
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,200
Come on

583
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,300
Saturday

584
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,000
l'll be free next Saturday
we can try it then

585
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,700
OK

586
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:22,900
OK, next Saturday then

587
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:23,500
Bye

588
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,600
Bye

589
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,500
Up already?

590
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,800
Yes

591
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,700
we just tested the bed
and you are working again?

592
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,200
l'm very hardworking

593
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,300
what are you writing now?

594
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,800
Here

595
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,300
The more l think of it, the more
pathetic the main character appears

596
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:46,900
Pathetic indeed

597
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,400
Perhaps l should make him a happier guy

598
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,500
Good

599
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,400
Should l turn him into a good guy?

600
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,200
Even though he is good
he has done bad things

601
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,700
So how should it end?

602
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,300
That's a good question

603
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,800
l'll leave this to you writers

604
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,500
You're not going to sleep?
Help me, please

605
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,700
Help me, please?

606
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,900
l can't

607
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,100
Go to sleep. You are tired

608
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,500
From now on

609
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,900
follow SP wong around the clock

610
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,800
Piero, l know how to spot a plainclothes

611
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,500
How?

612
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,500
lf he seems to be doing something

613
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,000
but is paying attention to us instead

614
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,800
then he is a cop

615
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,800
ls that so?

616
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,700
Then the whole place is filled with cops

617
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,100
They're everywhere

618
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,900
Yan

619
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,600
Boss

620
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,400
watching something?

621
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,800
You are a cop

622
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,000
we are guessing who a cop is

623
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,300
How trivial

624
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,400
l'm going for a massage, wanna come?

625
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,600
l hate it

626
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,600
Don't tell

627
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,400
Tell on him

628
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:00,500
l won't

629
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,900
what a coincidence

630
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,400
Yes, l was shopping in the hood

631
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,600
Haven't seen you for ages

632
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,300
6 or 7 years already

633
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,100
How are you?

634
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,100
l'm married. How about you?

635
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,900
Still working in...?

636
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,100
Mommy

637
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,100
Your daughter?

638
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,200
Yes

639
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:41,800
How old is she?

640
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,000
5 years old

641
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:48,000
l'm waiting for my husband's car, so...

642
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,600
l'm also in a hurry

643
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,200
Bye

644
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,300
Bye

645
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,800
Mommy, l'm 6 already

646
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,700
Sorry, l always get it wrong

647
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,100
where are you now?

648
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,200
On my way

649
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:48,900
Hello?

650
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,600
Boss, he is taking the subway

651
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,400
Keep following him

652
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,700
Boss, he has gone to the 24th floor

653
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,200
Stay put. Don't do anything rash

654
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,600
Boss, we've got him

655
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,600
l don't know yet

656
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,600
But l know where he is now

657
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,900
Keep watch over here

658
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,700
So? Any good news?

659
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,900
A shipment will come in next week

660
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,500
Time and location yet to be confirmed

661
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,800
l still don't know who Sam's mole is

662
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,100
but he seems confident he can blow
my cover

663
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,100
ln that case

664
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,100
we'd better stop it
we're gonna lose for sure

665
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,100
You are kidding, right?

666
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,600
what else can we do? lt's deadly business

667
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:45,800
Hello?

668
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Boss said he had found the mole
He told us to take care of him

669
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,500
l'll be right there

670
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,000
Hello?

671
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,000
Keep an eye on SP wong

672
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,800
You two, take the stairs

673
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,200
Keung, take the elevator

674
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,900
Anyone knows you're seeing me today?

675
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,800
No

676
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,100
They are downstairs now

677
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,600
what are you doing?

678
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,100
Put it away

679
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,400
Take the window-washing scaffolding

680
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,500
How about you?

681
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,100
l'll take the elevator

682
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,300
Be careful

683
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,500
Nothing

684
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,700
Darling, the apartment is superb

685
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,600
A 180-degree window facing
the golf course

686
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,400
plus club membership costs less than
a million

687
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Superintendent wong?

688
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,200
Turn around to the main entrance

689
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,900
what do you think of me?

690
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,300
Your birthday is on the 25th, right?

691
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:19,900
Let's go

692
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,200
Police. Let's go

693
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,900
Bad news, Boss

694
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,200
Something happened to SP wong

695
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,000
There's a gunfight in Sheung wan
this afternoon

696
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,400
Three suspects were dead;

697
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,100
several suspects and pedestrians
were injured

698
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:58,600
The police confirmed that
one of the victims

699
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,800
was superintendent in OCTB
Mr. wong Chi-shing

700
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,200
The motive is unknown

701
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,900
Possibility of gang feud is not ruled out

702
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,000
They are now after several triad members
active in the Southern Kowloon area

703
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,700
The Police Commissioner

704
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:11,600
expressed condolence

705
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,600
and pledged to solve the case
as soon as possible

706
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,400
lt was a close shave

707
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,600
10 minutes after you went to your massage

708
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,500
Boss told us to get ready

709
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,400
l was scared stiff

710
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,900
You know
l hide under the car in every fight

711
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,700
And there were guns up there

712
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,600
l wanted to sneak out of there

713
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:42,900
Two days ago
Boss told me to go to his room

714
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,600
He asked me how long l'd worked for him

715
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,200
How the hell could l remember?

716
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,300
He then said: Keung

717
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,100
it's been 5 years already

718
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,400
You've performed well all these years

719
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,300
l have a question for you

720
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,300
lf one of your brothers is a mole

721
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,900
will you dare to take him out?

722
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,200
Of course l said yes to his face

723
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,100
You think l'm an idiot?

724
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,200
what's the result?

725
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,000
Of course they couldn't find the mole

726
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,800
The cop was tough

727
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,700
They dragged him upstairs

728
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,500
and beat him up for a good 10 minutes

729
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,000
10 minutes...

730
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,400
10 minutes...

731
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,800
He didn't say a word

732
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,300
Keung

733
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,100
Boss said...

734
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,400
the cop was hot on his trail

735
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:00,100
who didn't show up today is the mole

736
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,300
l didn't...

737
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,700
tell him you went for a massage

738
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:09,600
lf Boss knew, you're dead meat

739
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,600
Yan, l want to ask you something

740
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,100
How was the masseuse today?

741
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,500
Because...

742
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,400
if she's ugly, it's not worth it

743
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,600
Leave right away

744
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,100
There will be lots of cops after a car crash

745
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,400
Anyway, remember this:

746
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,600
if you see someone

747
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:53,000
doing something
but at the same time watching you...

748
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,000
then he is a cop

749
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,700
According to the closed-circuit TV

750
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,200
SP wong entered that building at 4:15 pm

751
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,100
The suspects entered 20 minutes later

752
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,300
At 4:38 pm

753
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,400
we received lnspector Lau's report

754
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:00,800
8 minutes before we arrived
someone fell off the building

755
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,500
That was SP wong

756
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,900
All the suspects killed or
injured belong to Sam's gang

757
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,300
Many suspects escaped

758
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,300
The actual numbers are unknown

759
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Do you know why SP wong went to
that building?

760
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,700
lt was me

761
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,700
l told ClB to follow him

762
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,700
why was ClB following him?

763
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,600
That's lA's business

764
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,900
Now that SP wong is dead

765
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,500
it is OCTB's business

766
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,000
what kind of attitude is that?

767
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,500
SP wong was dedicated to the police force
and you investigated him?

768
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,400
what kind of attitude is that?

769
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,400
So we senior officers have to ask
for your approval, huh?

770
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,100
Your people have made a mistake now
Or SP wong wouldn't have died

771
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,400
l am talking business here

772
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,700
l am talking personal matters

773
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:45,700
Nobody wanted this, OK?

774
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,800
Sorry, sir

775
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:56,600
lt's my negligence

776
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,900
l will give everybody an answer

777
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:02,600
Sorry

778
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,100
SP wong has a file

779
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,400
with information on our undercover
in Sam's gang

780
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,800
lt is locked by a password

781
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,000
The technical staff can't decipher it

782
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:17,500
lnspector Lau

783
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:18,400
Yes

784
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,700
work with ClB

785
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:21,900
to unlock it

786
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,100
Find our man and get him out of there

787
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,200
By the way

788
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,300
SP wong was a good cop

789
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,900
we should give him a grand funeral

790
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:36,200
Okay?

791
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:37,900
Yes, sir

792
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:50,500
Hello?

793
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,600
Boss. why made such a scene?

794
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,600
He was following me all the time

795
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,200
One of us would have to die

796
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,800
l'm now in charge of everything here

797
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,600
lf you're having any transactions
just let me know

798
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:02,900
lt's done

799
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,900
we got the goods when they killed
the cop today

800
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,400
l won't bother you now

801
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,800
what did you call me for?

802
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,900
So you're the one?

803
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:26,300
who are you?

804
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,000
lnspector Lau of OCTB

805
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,100
SP wong is gone. we're all upset

806
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,500
l still have unfinished business

807
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,900
SP wong wouldn't want you to
take law in your own hands

808
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,400
what do you want?

809
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Co-operation

810
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:59,400
The police has discovered

811
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:01,300
the body of a fugitive suspect
He was involved in

812
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,600
the Sheung wan shooting earlier today

813
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,800
The police has confirmed

814
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:09,200
the body to be an undercover cop
Tsui wai-keung

815
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,400
The police has expressed their condolence

816
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:12,600
and promised a thorough investigation

817
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,000
Boss, Yan is back

818
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:17,500
Three vehicles collided in Yuen Long
today

819
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,200
The driver of the private car was trapped

820
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,000
until firefighters came and rescued him

821
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,100
Boss

822
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,000
what is it, Yan?

823
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:29,900
l have taken care of Keung already

824
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,300
Did you ever send him to the warehouse?

825
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,500
lt will be disastrous if he knows where it is

826
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,100
Boss. lt's me

827
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,400
You don't have to go yourself

828
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:50,800
l don't want anyone to know the password

829
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:52,100
l understand

830
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,700
l'll send everyone away

831
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:03,600
lnspector Cheung

832
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,600
Tell those boys to stop following
Sam's gang

833
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,200
l got information that Sam is heading
towards the warehouse

834
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,700
He won't go if he's being tailed

835
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,100
Just call them back

836
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,800
Let's do something for SP wong

837
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,400
Please help me, OK?

838
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,100
Say something

839
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:29,800
This is not my case

840
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,400
Officer Chan told me not to get involved

841
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:37,000
lf they're willing to stop
then it's up to them

842
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,300
l know l'm responsible for
SP wong's death

843
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,400
l am also a cop, like you

844
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,700
l want to solve the case too

845
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,900
l thought you only want promotion

846
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:50,400
lt's SP wong's mole who tipped me off

847
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,400
Do you believe it or not?

848
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:53,600
This is our last chance
Are you ready to take the risk?

849
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,300
Attention: Target vehicle

850
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,600
on Highway no.3

851
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,500
U-turn at Pier 3

852
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,100
to Lung Cheung Road

853
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,300
They have been here for 20 minutes

854
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,200
they are going to the 4th floor of
the car park

855
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:36,000
Officer Chan won't let me touch this case

856
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,500
lf anything goes wrong
you'll take the blame

857
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,700
They are loading the goods at 4P

858
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,900
Elephant, stand by at the exit at 3P

859
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,800
Double Eight, watch the entrance at 2P

860
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,300
Fishball and Cheung, stand by here

861
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:54,000
All of you, wait for my signal

862
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,000
Oh, l forgot Boss told me to stay behind

863
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,300
Drop me off here

864
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,200
Run him over

865
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,100
My Master always said that about my life:

866
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,500
what thousands must die so that
Caesar may become great

867
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,800
You choose your own future

868
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,300
That's what you have chosen

869
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:59,600
Coffee for you

870
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,300
He's waited a long time for you

871
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,600
So it's you?

872
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,100
was the stereo OK?

873
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:27,400
Pretty good

874
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,600
Those tube amps have to be warmed up

875
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:32,000
wait 10 minutes and it sounds great

876
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:33,900
Should l salute you?

877
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:35,100
Not, don't

878
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,200
How long have you been an undercover?

879
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,700
l've followed Sam for 3 years

880
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:42,600
l had several other bosses before

881
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,600
All together it's been 10 years

882
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,900
10 years?

883
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,600
l should salute you instead

884
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,100
l just want an identity

885
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:50,800
l want to be a normal man

886
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:53,000
Getting tired?

887
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:57,700
You've never been a mole
you won't understand

888
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,800
Too bad l still can't find the stooge

889
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,500
l'll take him down if l find him

890
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,400
Don't worry
Let me give you back your identity

891
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,400
l'll open your file but...

892
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,900
l don't have the password

893
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,500
what's the Morse code for
''undercover''?

894
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:24,900
That's it?

895
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,200
Are you serious?

896
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,900
You don't even know to
spell BODYGUARD?

897
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:14,900
lsn't it supposed to look like this?

898
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,400
Of course not

899
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:30,600
Dr. Lee

900
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,200
l thought you wouldn't come

901
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,000
You're wanted by the police

902
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:38,400
Can l sleep in your chair again?

903
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:40,500
Let's talk upstairs

904
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,200
Last time you said you're a cop

905
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,100
ls it true?

906
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:49,800
lt was true

907
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:52,100
But l'm not so sure now

908
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,000
So what's your plan?

909
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,500
l don't know. Still thinking

910
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,700
There's one thing l've been trying to
tell you for a while

911
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,900
But it's too embarrassing

912
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,400
l told you l dreamt about you all the time

913
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,400
lt's true

914
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:42,000
Me too

915
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,600
Remember my secret. Goodbye

916
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:47,300
Mary

917
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,900
what is it? Has it broken down?

918
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:04,100
This morning
the guys from the stereo shop came

919
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:07,000
They have tuned it up already

920
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,100
They also left a CD sampler for you

921
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:13,600
l've listened to it

922
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:21,600
Have you had breakfast yet?

923
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:23,200
l'll get you some

924
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:25,700
lced tea?

925
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,000
Chinese buns?

926
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,400
Sure

927
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:48,900
l can't finish my novel

928
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,100
l don't know whether he's good or bad

929
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,900
l think only he knows

930
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,200
A shipment will come in next week

931
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,800
They are watching closely

932
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,300
You do what you need to do

933
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:11,700
l will handle the rest

934
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:16,100
The file is open. l can't handle it

935
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,000
So you're not worried about me

936
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,400
You are worried about yourself
lnspector Lau

937
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,300
Are the voices crisp enough?

938
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:28,700
The precious recording

939
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,500
was taken from Sam's office

940
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:33,600
lt's not your lucky day

941
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,900
Don't threaten me. what do you want?

942
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:38,600
l want my identity back

943
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,200
3 pm, Central Ferry Pier
Keep your cell on

944
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,500
The number you have dialed cannot be
connected

945
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,800
Please leave a message after the beep

946
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:14,000
Mary, l'm sorry

947
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:16,700
l've chosen to be the good guy

948
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,100
l'm going to meet Yan now

949
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:22,500
No matter what
l'll give him back his identity

950
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,700
The file is in my computer

951
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,000
The password is your birthday

952
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,200
You sure know what you're doing

953
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,100
l also went to the cadet school

954
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:53,700
Do all undercover cops like rooftops?

955
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,700
Unlike you, l'm not afraid of light

956
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:01,800
So where's the stuff l want?

957
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:05,600
l don't think you've brought
what l want either

958
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:11,800
So what does this mean?

959
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,500
we came up here to sunbathe?

960
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,000
Give me a chance

961
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:20,800
How?

962
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,300
l have no choice before

963
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,500
but now l want to turn over a new leaf

964
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:32,700
Good

965
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,000
Try telling that to the judge

966
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,000
See what he has to say

967
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:43,900
You want me dead?

968
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:47,000
Sorry, l'm a cop

969
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,200
who knows that?

970
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:06,300
Don't move. Police

971
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,400
Drop your weapon and let lnspector Lau
go first

972
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,500
Your boss is Sam's mole

973
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,000
l got evidence

974
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:14,800
Let's clear this up at the station

975
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,300
Drop your weapon now

976
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:18,600
l've called the police

977
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:19,800
why should l trust you?

978
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:21,300
You don't have to

979
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,300
You'd better watch out

980
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,100
Look who's talking

981
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,500
l wish you every success in
the police force

982
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:41,300
Bottoms up, officers

983
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,200
No sweat. we are brothers

984
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:49,800
Sam is dead now

985
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:53,600
You have to look after me

986
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,100
l joined the cadet school in 1994

987
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:05,700
But my career never really takes off

988
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:08,800
Sam looked down on me

989
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,300
l've taken care of Sam's tape

990
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,300
Don't worry. l'll follow you from now on

991
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:19,500
Our folks will be here any minute
Let's give them a good show

992
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:28,900
l'm actually quite smart
Too bad Sam never knew that

993
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,200
l'm a cop

994
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,700
Six months later, Dr. Lee Sum Yee
was looking through the personal

995
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,600
properties left by Officer Yip
Headmaster of the Cadet

996
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:43,200
She found Chen wing-yan's file that
proved his police identity

997
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,200
Chen wing-yan is now buried
next to SP wong Chi-shing

998
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,800
How are you, Mr. Policeman?

999
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:15,100
Those who break the rules will be like him

1000
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,700
They will be expelled

1001
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:19,800
Anybody wants to trade place with him?

1002
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:28,600
l do

1003
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:38,400
Says the Buddha:

1004
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,700
''He who is in Continuous Hell never dies

1005
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,700
Longevity is a big hardship
in Continuous Hell''
