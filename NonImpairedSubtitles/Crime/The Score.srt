1
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,998
Let's get down!
Let's hear you scream!

2
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,239
Wait!

3
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,396
What?

4
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,399
This...

5
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,039
No, later.

6
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,235
No, I want to smoke.

7
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,719
I want to smoke!

8
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,990
Fine. Smoke!

9
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,077
Smoke all night.

10
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,189
Be still. Do not turn around.

11
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,871
Do not turn around. You'll not be hurt.

12
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,555
- Bonjour, Nick.
- Bonjour, Madame.

13
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,999
- Voilá. Bonne journée.
- Bonne journée á vous.

14
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,678
Albert. Ca va?

15
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,394
- Ca va.
- Boss, hi!

16
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,398
- Jean-Claude.
- So, the trip was good?

17
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,749
Trés bien.

18
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,234
- How we doing?
- Great. Many reservations for tonight.

19
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,637
- Good. How many covers last night?
- Over 1 50.

20
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,353
- Good.
- The bar was steady.

21
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,755
- How was the music?
- Great band!

22
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,632
Good, good...

23
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,633
Albert...

24
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,717
Scotch on the rocks. A little water.

25
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,876
- Yeah, sure.
- Merci!

26
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,915
Attention, mes enfants!

27
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,594
- C'est grand-pére. J'arrive.
- Monsieur Max, comment vas-tu?

28
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,950
- Oú est Nicky?
- Juste en haut.

29
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,639
Max!

30
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,798
Voilá! Back from Bermuda.

31
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,319
Good trip?

32
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,273
Not as interesting as yours, I'm sure.

33
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,638
My God. Let me get a look at you.

34
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,229
You look like shit! What's your secret?

35
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,352
- Jean-Claude, set up number two.
- Yeah, sure.

36
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,678
J'ai une grande soif
et j'ai besoin d'un peu de glace.

37
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,029
Tout de suite.

38
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,391
- Merci.
- Give us a little room.

39
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,510
Et voilá. A votre santé, Monsieur Max.

40
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,232
Bermuda.

41
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,078
Ah, God!

42
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,509
Well...

43
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,598
- It was pretty tight out there.
- Good. It'll keep you sharp.

44
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,030
I got a minor development.

45
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,072
- We lost the buyer.
- What do you mean?

46
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,479
She's in a brass casket, 6 feet under
ground never to be heard from again.

47
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,916
I fronted 20,000 in expenses.
I'm due that plus two-fifty for my end.

48
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,874
You think I won't take care of you
and cover your expenses?

49
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,356
It's not about expenses, I want
the money. Find another buyer.

50
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,676
Of course! But shit happens!

51
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,112
It'll drag on. You gotta be patient.
Wait a minute!

52
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,635
How about this?
Four big ones in your hand...

53
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,389
- $4 million in your mit.
- $4 million?

54
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,230
More than you ever dreamed of.
More than we ever did together!

55
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,309
- $4 million... What are you into?
- Well, I spotted an exceptional item.

56
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,239
It was European antiquity...

57
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,673
Elegant and in the hands of this dumb
prick that didn't know what he had.

58
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,992
And unfortunately it's become
detained in transit a little...

59
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,350
You don't wanna know where?

60
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,354
- It depends.
- Depends on what?

61
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,552
It depends on
what you're gonna tell me.

62
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,797
It's in the Montreal Customs House.

63
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,830
- No. No way.
- Oh, yeah.

64
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,598
- Forget it.
- Wait a minute.

65
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,313
I got a guy...

66
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,957
...he gives you the whole layout,
handles security, everything.

67
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,991
You used to tell me:

68
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,354
"Steal outside the country, in the States,
in Europe, but live in Montreal."

69
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,314
I said a lot of dumb things
in my day, didn't l?

70
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,877
Let's just find another buyer for this,
OK? I gotta open the place.

71
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,674
OK, but I'm not finished
talking about this.

72
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,513
- Jean-Claude, Albert! Come on!
- You're making a large error here.

73
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,997
Not bad.

74
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,394
- Yeah?
- Ijust landed. I got the delivery.

75
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,477
- You got the bag?
- Yeah, right here.

76
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,798
- Where's Johnny?
- He got it in lstanbul, through the neck!

77
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,549
- Jesus. He was a good kid.
- Yeah. Good and dead.

78
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,151
- You want to talk or see what I got?
- How can I be sure you're OK?

79
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,473
- I suppose I could fuck you.
- That would work!

80
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,954
Hey... You OK?

81
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,349
Yeah...great.

82
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,471
- How was your trip?
- I dunno...

83
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,111
Cities!

84
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,233
They are all starting to look the same.
They really are.

85
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,075
And the pasta in Rome
is not as good as yours.

86
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,157
And the ass-pinchers! They used
to look so charmingly European!

87
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,396
Not as good as me?

88
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,312
Common!

89
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,433
It must be what it is about you I like,
because you are definitely not common.

90
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,349
- What if I were...?
- Were what?

91
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,518
...a little more common, you know,
and around more?

92
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,476
- How much more?
- Like all-the-time more?

93
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,435
If I was just a jazz club owner and not
that other thing. How'd you feel?

94
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,756
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

95
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,554
I think that's what I'm saying.

96
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,833
Hey, baby, you know I'd never ask you
to change anything for me. Right?

97
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,238
I know that. I'm just asking
how would you feel about that?

98
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,309
I dunno...

99
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,358
I suppose I'd have to give it
some serious thought.

100
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,593
Then you'd better start giving it
some serious thought.

101
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,198
Thank you.
I'll see you when I see you?

102
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,470
See you when I see you.

103
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,635
- Madame...
- Alors!

104
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,594
- Voilá. Bonne journée.
- Merci.

105
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,030
Excuse me. Can you help me, please?

106
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,037
C-Can you help me?

107
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,276
- Place Norman?
- Yes. Yes.

108
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,153
Go to the corner, make a right,
go two blocks...

109
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,874
- Two blocks, then a left...
- Again, please.

110
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,868
Two blocks on the corner,
two blocks this way, one block left.

111
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,230
- And you're there.
- OK, thank you.

112
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,317
Thank you, Nick.

113
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,635
What? What did you say?

114
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,354
I said, "Thank you, Nick."

115
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,509
I'm Max's guy in the Customs House.
We should talk.

116
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,871
OK, bye-bye. Thank you.

117
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,877
Thank you. Bye!

118
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,717
- Where's Max?
- He's in the sun room.

119
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,559
- Max...
- Nicolai, Nicolai.

120
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,479
Have you lost your fucking mind?!

121
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,796
My mind? Yes, years ago. Why?

122
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,468
- What did you tell this kid?
- Who?

123
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,636
Your inside guy with the retard act.

124
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,549
He was in front of my house,
he knew who I was.

125
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,797
He must have followed me
to the club and seen you.

126
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,833
Tell him next time
he'll wind up in the hospital.

127
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,715
Wait a minute. You think
I'd set you up with a jerk-off heister?

128
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,071
You gotta admit
the kid did a good show.

129
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,238
I don't give a shit.
Don't expose me like that.

130
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,908
You've got it pre-wired,
turn the key...

131
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,553
I'm not interested.

132
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,911
You'll never get another chance.
What's the matter with you?

133
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,590
- Why are you pushing this?
- Four million balls, that's why!

134
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,678
He's pushing it
'cause we're running out of time.

135
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,634
I'm saying if I'm gonna work
with a partner we gotta start now.

136
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,912
- What are you doing in my house?
- All I'm saying...

137
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,715
- What the fuck does this kid know?
- I've been on this for 3 weeks.

138
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,639
I gotta know if you're the guy
Max says you are.

139
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,593
- I gotta go.
- Nick! Nick! Wait!

140
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,236
- Nicky!
- Hey! I didn't come 500 miles to...

141
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,434
- Jack Teller, nice to meet you.
- You don't know where your dick is!

142
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,918
We decided
you'd sit tight until I called. Right?

143
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,680
I thought I could help.
You said he was in.

144
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,111
Don't be so creative.
Get the fuck outta my house!

145
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,551
When you get
your shit together, call me!

146
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,909
Unbelievable!

147
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,797
Jesus! Take it easy!

148
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,149
Listen close... Leave town tonight,
don't come back.

149
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,113
I see you again, I break your knees.

150
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,359
I see you around Nick, I'll kill you.
It's a dangerous game you're playing.

151
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,709
Are we clear?

152
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,191
Yeah, we're clear.

153
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,918
How did it go?

154
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,678
Not as planned.

155
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,519
- What do you want?
- Some respect from you for starters!

156
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,233
I mean, what are you thinking?
I'm on a job here.

157
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,000
If you just don't want
to come in on it, say no.

158
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,591
Don't send some fucking third-rate
Rent-a-Thug. Do it like a professional!

159
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,311
Hello...?

160
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,988
Yeah... OK.

161
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,070
He's right here. Don't worry.
Go home. I'll call you later.

162
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,032
All right? That's OK.

163
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,389
OK.

164
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,355
I didn't come here
to cause any trouble. All right? I didn't.

165
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,590
Coming up to you on the street,
that was a stupid move.

166
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,075
Sorry. Why don't we just call it even?

167
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,396
I just want to say one thing to you
and then I'll go away if you want.

168
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,753
I have been casing this place
for a couple of weeks, now.

169
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,475
It's a little bit complicated,
but it's a very doable job.

170
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:30,276
I can handle the system in there
if someone else can break into this box.

171
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,758
I don't know you. You don't know me.
It's not the best way to do things, but...

172
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,155
I am very good at what I do.

173
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,035
And I take it very, very seriously.
Check it out with Max.

174
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,870
If you are the guy
that he says you are, then...

175
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,595
...we should check this out, take
a look at it. That's all I'm saying.

176
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,828
This is a very big pay-off
for very acceptable risks.

177
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,554
Go take a look at it for yourself.

178
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,629
I like your place.

179
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,956
You got good taste.

180
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,596
Jesus! It's nice and dark in here!
Fucking everything!

181
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,916
- Hey! Nick!
- Max!

182
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,357
Jesus!

183
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,915
Why don't you jump for some lights?

184
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,318
Every time I come in here,
I have to play hide-and-seek!

185
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,953
How are you?

186
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,717
Now, you gotta tell me the...

187
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,272
...the magic word.

188
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,672
All right. I'm going to do it.

189
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,348
Good, good. Jesus! Sweetheart!

190
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,834
You're a sweetheart!

191
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,873
Bravo! You're making sense.

192
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,517
But because of the risk involved
my end's gotta be $6 million.

193
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,359
Operator? I gotta nut down here
that just said $6 million.

194
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,152
No. Send paramedics.

195
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,316
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

196
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,114
Six fucking million?!
What happened to four?

197
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,551
No. It's my backyard.
I'm not going to go like that.

198
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,752
If you want me to do this,
pay me right.

199
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,518
I always pay you right.

200
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,632
You think you pay me right,
but I know.

201
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,513
It's not always right. I need this for this.

202
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,869
I like your style.
Yeah, well, OK, I understand.

203
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,872
That's what I have to do.
I want to pay off the mortgage.

204
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,958
I want to own this place,
free and clear.

205
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,153
I live the way I want.
Because after this, no more jobs.

206
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,679
I'm quitting.

207
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,155
How many times you told me that?

208
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,590
I'll believe that
when the pigs eat my brother.

209
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,872
- Right?
- I'm done. No more.

210
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,476
Well, OK. I hope she's worth it.

211
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,277
It's Numb Nuts.

212
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,839
Nice house. Nice club.
You must be really good.

213
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,396
I don't want to have to do this
but raise your arms.

214
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,989
Be my guest.

215
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,918
He's all right.

216
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,919
OK?

217
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,638
Is this a social call?
What are we doing?

218
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,838
I will explore this with you. But I run
this operation down to the last detail.

219
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,077
If you have a problem with that,
we can go home right now.

220
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,078
- Is there a problem with that?
- That's fine.

221
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,078
Tell me everything you know,
then I'll design the plan.

222
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,955
If I smell something about the job
or you I don't like, I walk away.

223
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,833
If you're not living up to your end of it,

224
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,350
or if you hold out on me
in any way, I walk. Understood?

225
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,757
That's fine.
Tell me what you want to know.

226
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,828
- First of all, what are we looking for?
- Know what a sceptre is?

227
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,792
It's...something that a king holds.

228
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,313
Right there.

229
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,318
It was made in 1 661 in France

230
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,355
for a special coronation...
for a girl queen.

231
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,199
- It's priceless.
- Not to us, it's not.

232
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,279
- What about the specific location?
- I can give you the whole building.

233
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,359
I got floor plans. I've been clocking
security patterns for over three weeks.

234
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,198
All right. Paint me a picture.

235
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,874
OK. He fixed me up with the job.

236
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,516
- Not me...Brian, the guy on the street.
- I remember.

237
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,393
Is he traceable?
Phone number, address?

238
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,718
No, it's totally tight. It's a charity case,
a favour. He doesn't exist on paper.

239
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,276
He just shows up as assistant janitor,
midnight to 8 a.m.

240
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,791
The security's basic.
At night theyjust lock it down.

241
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,516
They bar the groundfloor windows.
You can only enter by the truck court.

242
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,869
Thank you, Albert. Thank you.

243
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:56,200
Manpower's very light. One guy sitting
outside, keeping an eye on things.

244
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,435
Inside, everyone's got to come in
through a standard metal-detector.

245
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,349
It's a little tricky bringing things in,
but I think I've figured it out.

246
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,028
The guards know me,
nobody looks too close.

247
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,390
- OK, thank you.
- All right.

248
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,956
Once I'm inside,
I can go anywhere I want.

249
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,789
Everything gets run
from this one central console.

250
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,470
They got fixed video systems
in the elevators and hallways,

251
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,638
a couple ofmagnetic doors,
all very basic.

252
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,037
Lots of overtime! Not so much now.

253
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,791
The headjanitor's this old guy, Danny.
He loves Brian. Loves him!

254
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,036
I got this guy wrapped
around my finger.

255
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,117
He'd do anything for me.

256
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,593
Most of the time he's got me working
with him. Low level shit, helping out.

257
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,519
But I can get away from him,
I've lots ofreasons.

258
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,996
I've sketched half the place already.
Copied keys.

259
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,873
I can get you access to any room.

260
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,479
Where's the sceptre?

261
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,319
Well, you see...that's the kink.

262
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,953
Now get this!

263
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,833
It was arranged
to be brought into the country

264
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,715
inside the leg of an antique piano!

265
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,435
And it was so simple...
and then they impounded it!

266
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,392
Can you guess why?

267
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,160
Fucking bugs!

268
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,636
The whole shipment
was contaminated with termites.

269
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,796
Asian longhorned beetles!

270
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,228
We got fucked by bugs!

271
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,997
They burrow into the wood,
into the shipment crates.

272
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,509
So they delivered most of the goods,

273
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,359
but the piano's wooden,
so they impounded it.

274
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,076
They put the whole thing in quarantine
in a medium-security lock-up.

275
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,511
They're scary things, and they can't
send them back to France.

276
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,394
So they decide to burn everything.

277
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,958
Now...l'll tell you,
I don't know which fucking leg it's in.

278
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,072
But I was tempted
tojust grab 'em all and run!

279
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,716
I dunno if the thing's
going to melt or what.

280
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,990
I mean, I was dying!

281
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,713
So I had to improvise a little bit.

282
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,598
Laurent! I saw something in the fire.

283
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,756
- It's burning...
- No, look, look!

284
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,270
I saw...something...in the piano.

285
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,357
In the piano, look!

286
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,957
I saw something!

287
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,790
Everybody's freaking out.
Nobody knows what to do.

288
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,754
They don't see this kind of excitement.
So they get this supervisor outta bed.

289
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,795
He takes one look, he doesn't know
what it is, but he knows it's worth a lot.

290
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,675
He tells them, till it's sorted out,
to put it in a box in the basement,

291
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,711
and that's what they do.

292
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,310
- It's not a toy.
- I want to see. Can I see?

293
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,718
- No. Come on, let's go.
- OK. Bye-bye.

294
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,029
The basement is the most secure
lock-up in Eastern Canada.

295
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,515
It was a bomb shelter
during the Cold War.

296
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,748
They put all their important stuff in here,
State's evidence, narcotics, weapons.

297
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,349
That sceptre is somewhere in the safe.

298
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,111
The thing is, there's no cameras.
I'd have seen them on the monitors.

299
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,835
So if we put you inside,
you can work on it all night.

300
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,236
We'll need pictures of the safe
or a model number.

301
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,072
Then we'll need plans, infrastructure,
maps, blueprints, anything.

302
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,510
That's all for now.
Give me two days.

303
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,951
We just got to find a way
into that basement.

304
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,193
- You gonna let it go or stay pissed?
- Kiss my ass.

305
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,636
- We're about set up here. You ready?
- Hold on.

306
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,719
- Want to give me a mark?
- Not yet. Not yet.

307
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,874
- How are you doing?
- Stay off the air till I call.

308
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,436
Three-three, two-six.
Two-nine, three-two.

309
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,839
I repeat: 33, 26, 29, 32.

310
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,999
Copy that. Three-three, two-six,
two-nine, three-two.

311
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,436
Make a right.
Proceed east about 20 yards.

312
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,313
You should see the next opening.

313
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,354
I'm at a wall here, a cinder-block wall,
where you told me I have to go.

314
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,552
You're sure?
It's a straight shot on here.

315
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,557
It's not my imagination!

316
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,955
Wanna come see for yourself?

317
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,391
Right. OK, hold on.

318
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,436
Give me a second.

319
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,598
- Can you read me?
- Make a left, 20 feet.

320
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,794
You'll run into a parallel tunnel,
make a right, back on course.

321
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,953
Take the tunnel 150 yards west.

322
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,311
- You'll reach a T-junction.
- About 300 yards.

323
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,877
- Came to the end, made a right.
- Head northeast. Northeast.

324
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,196
One second, hold on.

325
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,998
- You with me?
- Going west. Going west. All right.

326
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,797
Right. Go 40 yards east,
then make a left turn.

327
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,276
Left turn...then make a right.

328
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,040
It'll be 500 yards to go.

329
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,599
OK, straight ahead, 20 feet,
you'll be under the room.

330
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,358
The tunnel will continue,

331
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,393
but look up and
you'll see the access ladder.

332
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,996
I'm at a shaft. I'm going to climb up.

333
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,552
What are you doing?

334
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,958
Still climbing.

335
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,914
This looks like it.

336
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,752
I'm done.

337
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,830
Who the hell is this?

338
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,870
There's a utility crew at the entrance.

339
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,753
You'll have to find another way out.

340
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,790
Where are you?

341
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,638
At De La Montagne and Ottawa.

342
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,118
- Repeat: De La Montagne, Ottawa.
- Got it. We're on our way.

343
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,913
This should be it, right there.

344
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,793
OK, we're just trying to find you.

345
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,389
There. He's right over there.

346
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,358
OK, you're all clear.

347
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,437
Coming out.

348
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,280
Officer! Pardonnez-moi.

349
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,637
- Je suis...perdu.
- Oui.

350
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,116
J'ai besoin de...
Comment s'appelle...?

351
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,070
- Rue Bonsecours.
- Rue Bonsecours?

352
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,038
Deux routes par lá,
puis tournez á gauche.

353
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,109
Merci. Bonsoir.

354
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,313
Hello!

355
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,638
Anybody home?

356
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,115
Hey! Champagne! Nice touch.

357
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,799
- Nice dress.
- You like?

358
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,274
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

359
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,991
So...you asked me a question
a couple of days ago.

360
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,068
And you gave it
some serious thought?

361
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,919
Actually I forgot the question!

362
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,835
Here's my answer.

363
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,838
- You're not holding up your glass.
- Sorry.

364
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:47,232
My father was a lawyer,
a very smart man, and he always said,

365
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,639
"A deal is good if it leaves both parties
feeling as if they gave up something."

366
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,550
Is an answer coming soon,
'cause the glass is getting heavy?

367
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,159
OK...

368
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,276
I will change my life.

369
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,471
I will move here.

370
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,718
I will love you.

371
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:14,313
And believe that
this is the best decision I've made.

372
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,909
But I will not move here if it means...

373
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:21,511
...l have to talk to you through glass.
I won't spend my nights worrying.

374
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,392
So...

375
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,957
If you can promise me as of now
that you're through,

376
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,072
then we can drink to making changes.

377
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,039
- I said you could drink now.
- I know.

378
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,917
I wanna do all that.

379
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,193
I just have to tell you
that I'm doing one more thing...

380
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,311
...and that's it.

381
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:58,554
Everything you said is great, perfect.
I just have one more thing I have to do.

382
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,197
I don't believe you asked me when
you knew you couldn't follow through!

383
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,119
- I'm following through. It's my last...
- Sure!

384
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:10,711
- I promise you, it is my last one.
- Then quit. Quit now.

385
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,798
- What's 'one last one' mean?
- We don't need anything.

386
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,629
I didn't need anything before,
and I don't need anything now.

387
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,990
What I wanted was to be with you.

388
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,351
What I didn't need
was this painful bullshit!

389
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:27,917
My life wasn't perfect before,
but at least we were clear.

390
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,432
- You gotta give me some...
- Shh! No.

391
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,596
See you when I see you.

392
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,670
Hey! What are you doing?

393
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,314
Somebody put fingerprints
on my window.

394
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,478
- You don't need to do it.
- I like a clean window.

395
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,717
It's all right.
We missed you last night.

396
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,797
- Feeling better?
- Yes, thank you.

397
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,592
- Sure?
- I'm OK.

398
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,598
- Take your time.
- OK, bye-bye!

399
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,313
Bye-bye!

400
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,831
That's your safe.

401
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,590
Traeger standing jeweller's safe.
This year's model.

402
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,678
If it's new, it'll be tough
getting the schematics.

403
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,998
I've got all this year's books, yeah.
What else?

404
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,955
OK. The system's lronclad Security,
a big commercial industrial outfit,

405
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,230
handling a lot
of the government buildings.

406
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,274
This building's old,
the lines are easy to find.

407
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,199
I can cut in three or four different places
and let you in.

408
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,960
But I gotta have the pass codes.

409
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,958
They don't keep them in here.
They'll be at lronclad.

410
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,152
- I dunno know what to do.
- OK...

411
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,155
You're calling someone now?

412
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,398
- Who is this?
- Me. Turn down the music.

413
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,278
Hey, Nick. I am fucked up.
My mother's totally out of control.

414
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,118
Listen carefully.

415
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,676
- Ironclad Security.
- Big outfit.

416
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,269
I need pass codes
for the Customs House.

417
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,314
Man, my concentration's shot,
I haven't slept in a month. Wait...

418
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,353
- What Customs House?
- Montreal.

419
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,955
You're not pissing in our own pool?

420
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,628
You said you'd never do a job
in Montreal!

421
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,229
- I know. Can you do it?
- Steven!

422
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,873
Who are you talking to?

423
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:47,153
I'm having a civil fucking conversation
with a friend, Mother!

424
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,270
- Are you OK?
- She is a ghoul!

425
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,552
- Now, tell me exactly what you want.
- One second.

426
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,433
I'll put someone on
to tell you what we need.

427
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,676
Just tell him what you need.

428
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,997
I need disarm and reset master codes
for the system.

429
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,236
I need individual sector bypass codes

430
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,592
to shut down one zone without lighting
off the whole board. OK?

431
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,949
Yes.

432
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,238
- You got that?
- Got it.

433
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,635
I'm gonna need this in 48 hours.

434
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,478
I'll double your last price.

435
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,560
Dude, give me a Kaypro 64 and
a live dial tone and I can do anything!

436
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,912
Now you are going to die!

437
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,475
This is someone you work with?

438
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,875
And you're giving me a hard time!

439
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,353
Thursday, 8.07 a.m.

440
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,439
Hi, got your message.

441
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:13,838
I got to cover for a sick stewardess
on a New York run.

442
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,636
We have to talk when I come through
in a couple of days. Bye.

443
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,591
End ofmessages.

444
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,952
Just lock it.

445
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,433
You work here?

446
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,278
No. Here.

447
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,798
Come on.

448
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,797
Come on, come on!

449
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,797
Want some coffee?

450
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,831
Yeah, yeah...

451
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,034
Is this what we're dealing with?

452
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,512
Page 720.

453
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,398
Where can I get one of these?

454
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,716
You gotta know the right people.

455
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,400
Traeger floor safe... Here it is.

456
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,077
"Solid steel body."

457
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,315
"Filled door with aluminium
and cobalt."

458
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,037
"Half inch hard plate."

459
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,117
"Double dial."

460
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,990
You'll need 2-3 hours
to drill through that.

461
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,760
- You can't drill this.
- Why not?

462
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,997
'Cause this is a newer model
with these glass packs.

463
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,156
See the glass pack, here?

464
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:58,353
See that? Drill through that, the glass
breaks and the bolts spring into place.

465
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,279
They're locked.
Not even with a bulldozer!

466
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,915
What do you have in mind?

467
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:09,591
I don't know, but if somebody built it,
somebody can unbuild it.

468
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:24,311
When I shut it down, this light'll go off,
but it won't register in the booth.

469
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,508
- Is that your box?
- That's it.

470
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:33,156
That's a fucking monster.
It's three times the size of this.

471
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,558
See that over there?

472
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,318
See it better over here.

473
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,431
That's an active infrared post.

474
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,192
That wasn't on the system specs.

475
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,676
That's some independent loop
set up in the cage.

476
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,631
I'll take care of it.

477
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,069
Yeah?

478
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,512
All right...just calm down. OK?

479
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,119
I'll be over in a few minutes.

480
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,071
I gotta do something. I'll drop you off.

481
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,478
My mom's only out for half an hour.

482
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,913
- What's the emergency?
- I was cruising lronclad's server...

483
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:42,910
...at the COBOL level, when someone
hacked back into my machines!

484
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,680
For 3 minutes I was fully exposed!

485
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,919
Now, I have to firewall
my whole operation from scratch.

486
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,430
- Can you just tell me that in English?
- Sorry...

487
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,270
I was just about to pull up those codes
when I hit a guy on the other end.

488
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,199
- What's on the other end?
- Ironclad's computers.

489
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,631
I guess he's some
low-level administrator, so...

490
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,310
...we switch to a private chat room,
and he sends me this...

491
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:14,154
Can you believe that? He comes
into my world and calls me an asshole!

492
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,679
And the bypass codes?

493
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,872
I type "How much?"
He says, "For the codes?"

494
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,117
I say, "You guessed it."
He says, "Fuck you!"

495
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:26,552
I say, "No, fuck you!" and he says,
"Fuck you!" I say, "Fuck you!" and...

496
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,116
Steven... Can you get me
the bypass codes?

497
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:35,039
The guy wants fifty thou'
in exchange for the codes.

498
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,879
- 50,000...?
- Yes.

499
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,837
Get the account.
I'll wire the money, he'll deliver to you.

500
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,359
Negative. No transfers.

501
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,870
He wants cash,
and he wants to do it in person.

502
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,718
- Anything else?
- No.

503
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,559
You set it up.
Stay, I'll let myself out.

504
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,275
When this whole score's done,
I'll brute this creep with all I got!

505
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,597
This fuck won't be able
to hide in Bolivia!

506
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,637
Jesus! Look at all these people!

507
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,433
Who sets up a meeting
in a public park?

508
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,113
- You see him?
- Still looking.

509
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,393
Got him. They brought back-up.

510
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,277
OK, I got him.

511
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:18,079
How you doing? Good to see you.
Shake my hand. That's right.

512
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,510
- You my guy?
- Yeah.

513
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,676
Who's this?

514
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,314
- Cousin.
- Cousin?

515
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:30,389
OK. See the guy back there
reading the paper, the big one?

516
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,034
That's my cousin. OK?

517
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,589
So we've all got family here,
which is nice, yeah?

518
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,998
I'll give you that. Take a look inside,
make sure you're happy.

519
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,754
Don't take that out!

520
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,758
Don't give me orders,
I get orders all day.

521
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,871
You can't count money in public.

522
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,868
That's why you don't set a meeting
in a park...for future reference.

523
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,235
Just flip through it in the bag.

524
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,872
- Set to go. You ready?
- What the fuck are you doing?

525
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,591
Give me the numbers,
and I'll read them into a mike

526
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,268
to get them checked out.

527
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:18,669
Think I was going
to write it down on a napkin?

528
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,916
- Ready.
- OK, you're on.

529
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,954
First set...

530
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,194
3-1 -7.

531
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,189
- 3-1 -7.
- Got it. 3- 1-7.

532
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,549
Steven...

533
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,399
...3-1 -7.

534
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,477
Confirm 3- 1-7.

535
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,876
It'll just be a second.

536
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,310
You guys maternal cousins or what?

537
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,434
- First numbers are clean.
- They're clean.

538
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:06,395
Tell the hack at the other end
if he tries to get in again, I'll fry him.

539
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,318
Worry about next time next time.

540
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,830
Let's finish before people start looking.
Give me the second set.

541
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,873
- 9-4-6.
- 9-4-6.

542
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,231
9-4-6. I repeat: 9-4-6.

543
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,192
9-4-6.

544
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,592
- Take it easy. Have a smoke.
- I don't smoke.

545
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,268
I don't smoke, either, so good for us.

546
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,155
- You guys local? You live around here?
- Why so many fucking questions?

547
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,472
- They're good.
- Second set is good.

548
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,309
What's the third one?

549
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,038
5-8-3-9.

550
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,832
5-8-3-9.

551
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,508
5-8-3-9, got it.

552
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,711
5-8...

553
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,512
...3-9.

554
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,994
- This is taking too long. I'm losing it!
- Shut up, Eric!

555
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,237
They have to verify the numbers.
It takes time.

556
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,839
Relax, Eric.

557
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,397
- Help! It's amateur hour here!
- Fuck you!

558
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:27,318
- What are you doing?
- One of them has a gun.

559
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,954
- How's it going?
- I'm working it, man!

560
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:34,233
- Steven, want some lunch?
- I'm on the phone, bitch!

561
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,079
- All right?
- Fine. Nobody move.

562
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,150
Eric, look in my hand right now.

563
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,595
If you take that, I'll take this out...
Be a big fucking mess.

564
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,953
Put it away, Eric.

565
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,230
What were you thinking?

566
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:54,912
Put it away. Take a deep breath.
Just put it in your back pocket.

567
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,118
Put it away.

568
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,029
- They're all good.
- Last set confirmed.

569
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,232
Last set confirmed.
Let's get out of here.

570
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,153
- Next time don't bring a gun.
- Listen...

571
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,794
I thought I might need one,
and I did...

572
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,309
Don't bring a gun.

573
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,149
Jesus...Christ!

574
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,988
I called, they said
you hadn't checked in yet. No...

575
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,669
So what time are you getting in?

576
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,910
Come on, don't stay at a hotel.

577
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,873
Just come over to my place.
I'll cook...

578
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,988
Yeah...

579
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,990
I was just saying come to my place,
I'll cook something, we'll talk, OK?

580
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,076
- This is good.
- Yeah.

581
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,357
When you gotta be there?

582
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,114
I'll go in a couple of hours.
I'm OK, fine.

583
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,159
Listen, tell me something...

584
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,396
All the years you've been doing this,

585
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:54,197
what's the biggest gamble you ever
took on a job, the biggest long shot?

586
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,470
I don't take long shots.

587
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:01,037
I know you're careful. I'm careful, too.
That's not what I mean.

588
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,110
When you were starting out,

589
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:08,950
you must've done something
a little wild, I'm just curious...

590
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,832
I never took long shots.

591
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,952
I'm gonna say something to you.

592
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,196
You're smart, you're talented,

593
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,312
but it's nothing
if you don't make the right choices.

594
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,592
Many talented people
never see the light of day.

595
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,759
Lastly, it takes discipline,
'cause this whole game is a long shot.

596
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:33,875
If you don't have the discipline to avoid
the gambles, the stupid moves,

597
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:38,596
then, my friend, one day
you will go down, it's inevitable.

598
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,596
You want my advice?

599
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,191
List everything you want now,

600
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:50,077
then spend the next 25 years
getting it...slowly...piece by piece.

601
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,993
I see what you're saying.

602
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:04,398
But still...you got all this already.

603
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,955
And you're still working with a partner,

604
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:11,199
in your own city on a job that's
more complicated than you thought.

605
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,869
So you're still taking
a shot at something.

606
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,553
I gotta go.

607
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,112
See you tomorrow.

608
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:37,194
Maintenance comes in by 6 a.m.
I gotta be in the hole by 5.30.

609
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,278
As soon as the guards leave,
you gotta tell me.

610
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,632
I'm more worried about how
you're going to break that safe...

611
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,559
...in half an hour, you know?

612
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,717
- Is that even possible?
- It's just physics.

613
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,914
- How long will it take?
- 1 2-1 5 minutes, tops.

614
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,554
1 5 minutes tops?

615
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,830
OK... OK...

616
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:29,033
If you're on the box by five, the prize
is in the bag by 5.1 5. No problem.

617
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:32,232
5.1 5-5.30 I'm in the hole,
you reset the system...

618
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,512
Perfect. I'll pack up my shit...

619
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:39,395
- We can go to Max's...
- We're not gonna meet back here.

620
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,989
- I'll meet you at Max's, then?
- No...

621
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,953
You finish your shift.
Max does his thing.

622
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,435
He pays us off,
we never meet again.

623
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:51,030
Forget it. I'll come with you
to deliver to Max.

624
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,798
- I'm telling you.
- No.

625
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,230
I've done this down to the last detail,

626
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,000
don't sideline me
when it's time to collect.

627
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,077
Listen to me, listen to me.

628
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,670
Do anything out of the ordinary,
you'll get made. Understand?

629
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,633
Be smart. Finish out your shift.

630
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,637
- You're the boss.
- OK.

631
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:32,152
Steven got these from a supplier.
Totally untraceable.

632
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:39,675
People are saying Max is in trouble
with Teddy Salida,

633
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,998
and he's pulling off a big job
to get rid of him.

634
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,952
That's what they say?

635
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,070
Maybe you should
walk away from this one.

636
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,194
Max?

637
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,754
Max!

638
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,678
What are you doing?

639
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,838
Jesus Christ!
You scared the shit out of me.

640
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,392
What the hell
are you doing down here?

641
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,637
Did you involve Teddy Salida in this?

642
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,149
- Teddy Salida?
- Yeah.

643
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,078
Why would you say that?

644
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:34,478
I see these guys outside.
They look like they might be with him.

645
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,198
How much you into him for?

646
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,434
$4 million.

647
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,474
You think they gave all this to me?
And a house in Bermuda?

648
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,830
What's the matter with you?

649
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,756
What's he know?

650
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,838
- About what?
- About what we're doing.

651
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,759
Nothing, I told him I'd found
something that would go for eight,

652
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,110
and we'd split the profits, that's all.

653
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:05,518
What are you actually
selling the sceptre for, Max?

654
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:08,359
$30 million.

655
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,869
Jesus! Max, what were you thinking?

656
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:18,871
Same thing you were thinking:
"How do we get out of all this bullshit?"

657
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,593
The chance came, I took it.

658
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,598
- It's gonna work out fine.
- No, it's not.

659
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,997
- What do you mean?
- It's a mess.

660
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,634
Wait a minute.
Wait a fucking minute!

661
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,877
This is absolutely clean, Nick.

662
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:38,868
What are you worried about?
It's my ass on the line, not yours.

663
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:42,755
I'm not gambling with my life
to hand my money to Teddy Salida.

664
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,077
You think you won't get
your fucking money?

665
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:50,717
Two things: one is you're gonna get
every fucking red cent.

666
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:54,833
- And yeah, Teddy knows a little.
- He knows?

667
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,112
- He knows a little!
- So you lied!

668
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,710
Lies! Shit happens, man!
Christ Almighty!

669
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,040
I lied for you and I lied for me.
To get you to suit up as always!

670
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,599
Max...

671
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:15,394
- I'm sorry, but I'm not going to do it.
- Nick...

672
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,355
It's a tiny door. Open it. Take the shit.
Close the door. We're out.

673
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,949
There's too much bullshit around!

674
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,912
What's that?

675
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,391
The buyer.

676
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,674
Simple.
Call him when you get the sceptre.

677
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:04,633
He'll meet you 30 miles up
the St Lawrence, a little town called...

678
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,274
...St Croix.

679
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:12,235
Give him the sceptre, take the cash.
Take your cut, wire me the rest.

680
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,711
I'll give Teddy his and...you're clean.

681
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,749
It's too risky. I can't.

682
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,030
You don't know what you're doing.

683
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,754
You know how long we go back?

684
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,193
25 years.

685
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,438
I'm gonna tell you something.

686
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,428
For the first time in my life,
I'm scared.

687
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:51,589
I don't know why it is. I was never
scared before, but I am now.

688
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:55,713
And you're right about Teddy.
He'll blow me away if he can.

689
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,913
If I don't get him his money, he...

690
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:07,952
Hey! Don't...
Don't let me slide on this one.

691
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,435
I can't afford it, man.

692
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,276
I can't... I can't scrap it out any more.

693
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,789
I gotta have some slack.

694
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,597
All right. OK.

695
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:35,516
- I hope you're not fucking me up.
- Nick... Hey, Nick!

696
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,597
Nicky...

697
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:51,035
I'm going down to check the power.

698
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,472
- How much more equipment you got?
- Here you go.

699
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:09,078
- Sorry, sorry!
- OK, Brian, come on in.

700
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,076
What's all the commotion?

701
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:15,556
- Just beefing things up downstairs.
- A few cameras.

702
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,716
- Like we'll lose it!
- Lose what?

703
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:22,914
That thing we found in the piano leg,
it turns out it's a French treasure.

704
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:27,716
- It's called a sceptre.
- Some expert got a look...

705
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,356
...now we're getting calls
from central office.

706
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,951
Hey, it's me.
We got a problem...

707
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:40,789
They got a camera
over the main door covering that.

708
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,912
They got a camera here
across the middle.

709
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,112
And they got one special
just on the box.

710
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,151
It sees this entire cage.

711
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:55,196
This camera is how high from the floor
and how low from the ceiling?

712
01:14:55,400 --> 01:15:00,679
Probably 1 0-1 2 feet off the floor,
4 feet from the ceiling.

713
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,757
I think we're fucked.

714
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,271
So...

715
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,315
When I'm here...

716
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,159
...cut the feed when I'm here,
then restore it.

717
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:16,512
When I'm ready here,
cut it again and I'll work here.

718
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,517
I don't know about that.

719
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:23,156
They'll move it soon.
We'll not get another chance.

720
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:27,148
We gotta go now
or we don't go at all.

721
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,432
Hi, Doug!

722
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,833
- Hi, Henri.
- Hi, Brian.

723
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:09,708
- OK. Thank you.
- No problem.

724
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,309
- Hi, Danny.
- Hello, Brian.

725
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:16,274
Look at you. What fancy new shoes.

726
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:22,193
- Yeah. My mom got those for me.
- Your mom got you those!

727
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,313
- I think you got a girl.
- No girl, you're a stinker!

728
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:32,034
You and your new shoes can give me
a hand waxing the cafeteria floor.

729
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:34,993
- OK.
- You hit the garbage.

730
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:39,352
- I'll meet you there in 1 5 minutes.
- 1 5? OK.

731
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:43,189
OK. I'll get the garbage, Danny. OK.

732
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,958
Bye-bye, André.

733
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:49,392
- You look good with those shoes.
- Yeah, thanks, I know.

734
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:15,235
- Watch your step, Brian.
- I will, thank you.

735
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,115
OK? OK, Danny.

736
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:20,278
- Guess what time it is.
- I don't know.

737
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,516
Yes, you do, it's lunchtime.

738
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:27,393
I tell you what, let's carry on
and finish the other side.

739
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,750
What? No! Why?

740
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:33,032
Then we can go
and grab some pancakes.

741
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:39,076
It won't take long. Throw a little extra
thinner in the mix, it'll go like butter.

742
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,998
- Danny, I am sorry.
- It's OK, I'll mop it up.

743
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:32,670
- I will get some more.
- You don't need it...

744
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,633
All right. You know where?
The groundfloor.

745
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,592
Below the closet.

746
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,911
Set to go. Set to go.

747
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:07,273
Are you there? I'm on my mark.

748
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,955
- Are you there?
- We're running late.

749
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:19,151
There was a snag.

750
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:23,272
I'm already set up. Give me a second.

751
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:32,675
I just got to punch in these codes.
Just sit tight.

752
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,989
I got it.

753
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,076
Hang on, one more beat.

754
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:06,959
It's clear.

755
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:36,755
I'm inside the first cage.
Repeat: inside the first cage.

756
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,589
You're all clear.

757
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:58,232
I'm set. Kill it.

758
01:26:58,440 --> 01:26:59,793
On my mark...

759
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,119
Hey!

760
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:12,355
Go!

761
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:17,829
I'm here.

762
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,199
There we go.

763
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:24,836
Perfect. Tell me
when you're in second position.

764
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:45,389
- How are you doing down there?
- Almost there.

765
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,077
Do you know where Brian is?

766
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:05,832
No idea.

767
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:07,911
- I'm ready.
- I need a second here, hold on.

768
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:10,714
I'm all set. Cut the cameras.

769
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:13,514
I'm all set. Cut the cameras.

770
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:18,151
Got to go.

771
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,317
What's up? What's up?

772
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:27,148
I got company. I got company.

773
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:30,878
Hang on one second.

774
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,672
Sit tight. I'll be back.

775
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,118
Jack, where are you?

776
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:24,954
Jack?

777
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:30,080
Jack, come in. Jack!

778
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,796
Jack, are you there?

779
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:10,118
- I'm pulling out.
- I'm back.

780
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,118
- It's too late. I'm pulling out.
- No, it's not.

781
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:14,799
Get ready to go.

782
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:18,676
On my mark...

783
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:23,837
Go, go, go!

784
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,672
What's wrong with these?

785
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:54,435
Hey, stop banging on it.
Check the connection.

786
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,031
You see something?

787
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:17,912
I don't know.

788
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,835
Call them. Call lronclad.

789
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:42,075
- And look like idiots?
- I don't care. Call them!

790
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:38,270
Maybe it's the equipment
down in the basement.

791
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,312
OK. Thanks.

792
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,754
Someone'll be here in a few minutes.

793
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:28,229
Brian?

794
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:32,316
Where are you, kid?

795
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:19,109
Make a move, make a sound
and you're dead. Understand me?

796
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:22,273
Turn around.

797
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:27,957
- Brian...?
- Shh! Be quiet.

798
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:39,152
Danny...

799
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:43,828
Danny... I wish
you'd not come down here.

800
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:50,473
Get over there. Turn around.
Come on, let's go.

801
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:52,875
Turn around. Walk over there.

802
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:54,957
Open the door.

803
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:56,958
Open it.

804
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:59,152
Get inside.

805
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:03,037
Look at me.

806
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:05,596
I don't want to hurt you.

807
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:09,873
But if you try to open that fucking door,
I will do it. Understand?

808
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:15,112
Stay in there and be quiet.
Everything'll be fine.

809
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,718
I don't want to wait.

810
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:20,354
You and Tommy go
into the basement now.

811
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,676
Come on, André, I'm watching this.

812
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,950
Laurent, please.

813
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:30,718
Tommy, get Philippe, we're gonna
be checking out the basement again.

814
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:13,839
Hold it right there!

815
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:16,156
- Are you crazy?
- Put it down.

816
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:19,955
- Come on.
- Take it off and put it down!

817
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:23,311
- Don't do this.
- Put it on the fucking floor!

818
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:27,911
Don't fucking argue with me.
Take it off and put it down!

819
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:30,076
I can't. I can't.

820
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:33,911
The next one's in your knee.
Don't fuck around.

821
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:38,238
We can work out the details later.
I am leaving with that sceptre.

822
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:42,228
Now take it off
and hand it over right now!

823
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:51,072
Put it down.

824
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:52,633
Slowly.

825
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:56,039
Now step back. Back up.

826
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:05,911
- Take off your mask.
- What?

827
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:08,031
Take it off!

828
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:12,192
I don't have time to play games.
Take it off!

829
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:26,670
Throw it over there.

830
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:29,837
Step in the middle.

831
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:32,349
Step in the middle!
That's right.

832
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:40,869
We wouldn't be here if you'd
shown me some respect. Just a little.

833
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:42,399
Stupid move.

834
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:45,717
We all come out ahead.
What are you doing...?

835
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:49,117
"A long shot."
Know what I think of your advice?

836
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:55,509
That's you trying to make me take
a sucker's share on a score I set up!

837
01:43:56,920 --> 01:44:01,277
You think I'm stupid, that I don't see
what you and Max are doing?

838
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:05,910
What is he giving you?
$5-$6 million?

839
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:08,190
Tell me that's not true.

840
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,834
See, that doesn't work for me.

841
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:13,917
I appreciate your help, but...

842
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:16,714
...you should've made me a partner.

843
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:19,798
Now I got to take a shot.

844
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:27,511
Just sit tight. Everything will be fine.

845
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:34,791
You got a choice:
head for that tunnel...

846
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,275
...or smile for that camera.

847
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:48,114
- André, what's happening?
- The basement!

848
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,709
We're being robbed!

849
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:57,277
Go outside, wait for the police!

850
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:07,312
- Let's go!
- Go! Go!

851
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:39,675
Ici! lci!

852
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:45,437
He's in the tunnel!

853
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,631
What do you see?

854
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,353
Find him!

855
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:53,752
Come on! Come on!

856
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:11,198
Come on! Come on!

857
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:56,120
- André? André?
- Shit!

858
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:58,231
- Is there a fire?
- It's OK.

859
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:04,680
- Where's Danny?
- Just get out!

860
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:06,996
Just wait outside!

861
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:11,279
- My radio...?
- Just wait outside!

862
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:12,959
OK. Bye-bye!

863
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:17,074
Wait, Brian.

864
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:29,553
- Have you seen Brian?
- He's OK. He's outside.

865
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:30,988
It's him!

866
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:03,589
The bus to Albany, New York
leaves in five...

867
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:09,077
- Yeah?
- You make it?

868
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:11,350
Fuck you!

869
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:16,429
I'm just checking if you got out OK.
I knew you'd give them the slip.

870
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:18,198
I'm almost home, too.

871
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:21,915
- You sure?
- Whatever you're thinking of doing...

872
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:25,351
...just forget it, OK?
This is over. Deal with it.

873
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:28,950
You don't know
where you're going and I do.

874
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:30,718
You don't know shit!

875
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:35,277
I'm 5 minutes from being
so far gone you can't imagine!

876
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:40,076
- You got nothing!
- You know what I got! I beat you!

877
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:44,068
Yeah? What have you got?
What have you got?

878
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:46,714
You know what I've got.

879
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:18,556
Tell me, Jack... When did you start
thinking you were better than me?

880
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:21,274
You still there, Ace?

881
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:25,598
OK. Nicely done...nicely done.

882
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:29,793
- Let's talk about this.
- How did you put it, "Deal with it"?

883
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,150
I don't think so. I can burn you.

884
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:35,272
We work this out
or I will take you down.

885
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:36,674
Yeah? How?

886
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:41,351
My shop, my tools, they're gone!
I'm just a tax-paying jazz club owner.

887
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:44,313
You? Every cop's looking for you now.

888
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:49,398
Ifl were you, I'd quit making threats
and hit the road.

889
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:53,917
Nice working with you, Ace!

890
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:56,236
"OK. Bye-bye!"

891
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:33,198
...Montreal was stunned by the daring
robbery of the Customs House.

892
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:35,516
A priceless sceptre was stolen.

893
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:40,475
A Senior nightjanitor identified
this man as the prime suspect.

894
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:43,717
He was spotted
leaving the scene after the robbery.

895
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:46,150
He's now the focus of a manhunt.

896
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:49,796
A second suspect
vanished without a trace.

897
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,912
Police have no solid leads...
