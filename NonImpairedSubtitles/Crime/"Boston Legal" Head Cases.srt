1
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:28,817
Tara.

2
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:34,310
Hi, I'm Brad chase from D.C.

3
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,564
Alan shore.

4
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:36,736
Pleasure.

5
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:39,076
I think that's my seat.

6
00:00:39,076 --> 00:00:40,996
Yes, I did see someone's things here.

7
00:00:40,996 --> 00:00:44,661
I moved them to a less desirable location.

8
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:54,223
I'm sorry. We're not territorial about
that sort of thing around here,
are we?

9
00:00:57,753 --> 00:00:58,875
Denny crane.

10
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,054
Yes, Denny, I know.
I run the New York office.

11
00:01:01,054 --> 00:01:02,703
Oh! / Peter stone.

12
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:04,793
- Denny crane.
- I know. I'm Chicago.

13
00:01:04,793 --> 00:01:08,340
My kind of town. Always had
the best sex of my life in Chicago.

14
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,349
What about you?

15
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:10,501
Well, um...

16
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:12,488
Greetings, Tokyo, London.

17
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:13,901
Good morning.

18
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:15,110
Morning, Denny.

19
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,648
Brad chase, there you are, soldier.

20
00:01:18,648 --> 00:01:22,993
Oh. Everybody remembers
Brad chase, I'm sure, hell, if I do.

21
00:01:22,993 --> 00:01:25,477
It's good to see you, man.
All right, everybody.

22
00:01:25,477 --> 00:01:27,294
Lock and load.

23
00:01:28,073 --> 00:01:29,670
Item one,

24
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,882
forget item one.

25
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:36,239
Actually, Denny, item one is a rather
urgent matter that we must discuss.

26
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,576
Why don't you brief us?

27
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:40,074
Gladly. If we...

28
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:42,564
Item two, Beckerman discovery?
What the hell is that?

29
00:01:42,564 --> 00:01:45,866
Uh, well, opposing counsel was
granted their motion to compel,

30
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:47,536
which means we are now required

31
00:01:47,536 --> 00:01:50,927
to turn over all correspondence
and scientific studies.

32
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:53,492
What about the ones we burned
before the judge's order?

33
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:54,989
We didn't burn any documents.

34
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,200
Well, sure we did.

35
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Do it today.

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,998
All right, Nigel, keep going.
We're listening.

37
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:03,503
Uh, if we don't...

38
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:04,961
Item three.

39
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:08,190
Damn it, Denny, this is not a way
to conduct a staff meeting.

40
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,643
- Where the hell is Edwin?
- Sorry I'm late, good people.

41
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,497
Is it casual Monday?

42
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:32,951
Edwin...

43
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:35,640
everything all right?

44
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,876
Hunky dory.

45
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:41,011
Unbelievable.

46
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:42,111
Not really.

47
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:44,569
Always figured him for a loon.

48
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:46,545
Tara! Where's Tara?

49
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:48,302
I need Tara!

50
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,862
I'm right here, Edwin.

51
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:52,341
Oh, thank you.

52
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:53,797
You have to contact Bill.

53
00:02:53,797 --> 00:02:55,215
I, I will, Edwin. I promise.

54
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:57,094
Apologize for my delay.
Then call my wife.

55
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,458
Tell her I've had a smallbreakdown,
not to worry. / Of course.

56
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,102
Oh, my goodness.
I have the brant appeal.

57
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:04,865
- I have the brant appeal.
- Relax, Edwin, we'll handle it.

58
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:08,902
Denny, guess what, I'm due
in court with Tara.

59
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:11,180
We're on it. Don't you worry.

60
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,674
You just get better.

61
00:03:12,674 --> 00:03:13,536
Okay.

62
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,348
Demagnetize his parking pass.

63
00:03:15,348 --> 00:03:17,709
- I beg your pardon?
- I know when a man is gone.

64
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,076
Do you think you can handle
this case without a copilot?

65
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,206
Well, I'm not...

66
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:23,195
Who's the judge?

67
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:25,370
- Resnick.
- He's a schmuck.

68
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,410
Alan, back Tara up.
She's before schmuck Resnick.

69
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,888
See if you can get a damn continuance.

70
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:33,460
Brad, you got a few minutes?

71
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,022
Actually, no.
I've got an early shuttle.

72
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:36,818
Get a later one.
I need some face time.

73
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:37,479
What's up?

74
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,622
Edwin poole was the only one here
able to rein in Denny crane without him.

75
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,644
If you are about to go
where I think you're going...

76
00:03:43,644 --> 00:03:46,143
We need you back in Boston
more than in D.C., Brad.

77
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,374
Lori, Ernidell just came in.
He's upset about something.

78
00:03:49,374 --> 00:03:51,414
I sent him to your office. / My office?

79
00:03:51,414 --> 00:03:53,325
Yeah, the alternative would
be Denny's office,

80
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:54,476
and nobody here wants that.

81
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:57,968
Excuse me. I need a lawyer.

82
00:03:57,968 --> 00:03:59,151
This is my daughter.

83
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:01,553
She tried out for the national
tour of Annie,

84
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:03,274
and she was the best one,

85
00:04:03,274 --> 00:04:05,890
and she was passed over
because she was black.

86
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,328
It's discrimination,

87
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:09,407
it's bigotry, it's prejudice,

88
00:04:09,407 --> 00:04:12,546
and we want justice.

89
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:18,676
Boston Legal
Head Cases

90
00:04:43,804 --> 00:04:45,365
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON ABC: 2004/10/03

91
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:49,565
Please tell me that you've never
seen anything like that before.

92
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:53,028
Baring your ass to 24 attorneys
including two overseas,

93
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:56,132
that is an unprecedented triumph.

94
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:59,428
I'm just distraught
I didn't think of it myself.

95
00:04:59,428 --> 00:05:01,502
You know what I like about you?

96
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,720
No, I do not.

97
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,729
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

98
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:05,639
Brad chase.

99
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,194
Look, I've been asked to stay,
which I'm considering,

100
00:05:07,194 --> 00:05:09,227
but I'm concerned that you and I
may have gotten off on the wrong foot.

101
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:12,035
I like to be straight up with people,
and if there's an issue or conflict,

102
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:15,214
let's address it head-on,
if you don't mind.

103
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:18,654
I have trouble talking that fast.

104
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:20,876
I don't believe in being straight up,

105
00:05:20,876 --> 00:05:25,617
but I'm a big fan of your
aqua velva commercials.

106
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,618
There's a potential client
in the conference room.

107
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,745
I'd like for you to meet with her.

108
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,088
Oh, forgot to mention,

109
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:32,144
I outrank you.

110
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:33,384
Do you?

111
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:35,917
And I'm such a slut for authority.

112
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:41,549
All right, you think the two little boys
could get off the playground now?

113
00:05:48,507 --> 00:05:50,744
- Kiss today.
- I don't want to sing.

114
00:05:50,744 --> 00:05:53,069
You need to practice.
You want to make Juilliard?

115
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:54,587
Kiss today.

116
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:04,537
Kiss today goodbye.

117
00:06:04,537 --> 00:06:05,678
Oh, my.

118
00:06:05,678 --> 00:06:07,562
Never mind "oh, my."

119
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:09,155
She sings like a sparrow.

120
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:10,649
Here, look.

121
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:11,767
I've got these producer notes,

122
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:14,791
which I was able to get ahold of
because of my own personal ingenuity,

123
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,379
says she has the most talent.

124
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:18,437
You can read it for yourself.

125
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:20,275
I'm afraid there's been
a terrible mistake.

126
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:21,970
I don't do musical comedy.

127
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,511
Annie's a drama.

128
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:24,837
It's full of suspense

129
00:06:24,837 --> 00:06:27,050
on whether the little girl
gets to live with the rich guy.

130
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,556
It's dramatic.

131
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:40,869
Can I help you? / Yes, I need to
speak to Edwin poole immediately.

132
00:06:40,869 --> 00:06:43,157
I'm afraid Mr. Poole has stepped
out. / You don't understand.

133
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:45,128
This is an urgent matter.

134
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:46,480
Where the hell is Edwin poole?

135
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,354
Hi. Is there anything
I can do to help?

136
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:52,419
Yes. My ex-husband is trying
to take my children from me,

137
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:54,943
and Edwin poole, he missed
my hearing today,

138
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:57,539
and I've been calling
his cell phone, and...

139
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,475
I mean, what the hell is
going on around here?

140
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:01,451
Excuse me.
I'm Brad chase.

141
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:03,009
We're gonna take care of this for you.

142
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:04,910
Now, why don't you just take
a seat in the conference room?

143
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,265
I'll get you a glass of water.

144
00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:08,610
All right.

145
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:10,699
Thank you.

146
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:12,217
Hey. / Yeah.

147
00:07:12,217 --> 00:07:13,690
- I was handling it.
- I just thought I'd help out.

148
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,470
That's very nice, but again,
I was handling it.

149
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,144
So why does it bother you
that I'm trying to help?

150
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:19,504
Well, maybe because you feel
I can't deal with a client on my own.

151
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:20,662
I don't feel that way at all.

152
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:22,623
Well, then I guess I really have
no idea what you feel.

153
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,199
I guess not. / And that's
supposed to be my fault?

154
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,595
Wait a minute.

155
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:30,270
You two have had sex.

156
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:41,444
I'm sorry.

157
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:45,779
We're not territorial about that
sort of thing around here, are we?

158
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:57,681
You're not gonna tell me.

159
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:00,884
I would prefer to tell Denny.

160
00:08:00,884 --> 00:08:02,193
Where the hell is he? / Ernie,

161
00:08:02,193 --> 00:08:05,228
you and I have done
business for a long time,

162
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:07,478
and we've always been able
to talk to each other.

163
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:10,406
If I'm to help you here...

164
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:16,450
My wife is cheating on me.

165
00:08:18,438 --> 00:08:25,512
And she informed me that she has been
cheating on me for entire marriage.

166
00:08:25,512 --> 00:08:27,959
It's been a fraud from day one.

167
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:31,671
Okay. First, you've only
been married since August.

168
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:34,497
Second, you've had five other
marriages dissolve, each...

169
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:37,984
But this, this was the real thing.

170
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,037
What's the goal, to get her back?

171
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:43,886
I, I'd like to put a private
investigator on her, get some proof.

172
00:08:43,886 --> 00:08:44,940
If she's admitted...

173
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,929
Goal being to get some compromising
pictures to use as leverage.

174
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:50,894
In hopes of...

175
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:54,325
Negotiating an annulment.

176
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,849
I know it sounds crazy,

177
00:08:56,849 --> 00:09:00,571
and I know I'm one of those
obnoxious stage mothers. I get that.

178
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:02,241
But Sarah worked hard.

179
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,077
I've tried to teach her what you earn,

180
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,946
people can't take that away from you.

181
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,632
She's earned this, Mr. Shore.

182
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:09,177
I have no doubt,

183
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:11,758
but you realize producers
do have discretion on that,

184
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:15,076
and the art of casting strikes me
as a very inexact science.

185
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:18,065
If they knew they were gonna go white,
why'd they let her try out at all?

186
00:09:18,065 --> 00:09:20,467
Why'd they let her get her hopes up?

187
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:21,961
I'll tell you why.

188
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:25,735
so they can pass themselves off
as equal-opportunity employers,

189
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:28,269
so they can claim to be about diversity.

190
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:34,758
They want it both ways, Mr. Shore,
and my daughter got hurt.

191
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:46,674
That was our deal.

192
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:49,655
I would work two jobs,
put him through business school,

193
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,404
then he would put me
through medical school.

194
00:09:52,404 --> 00:09:55,808
A week after he graduated,
he got a job running a mutual fund,

195
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:58,937
and a week after that, he left me.

196
00:09:58,937 --> 00:10:01,187
Our kids were 4 then.

197
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:02,654
Twins.

198
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:04,740
Simon and Harry.

199
00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:07,050
They're 8 now.

200
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:08,584
Oh, they're beautiful.

201
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:09,659
Thanks.

202
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:12,162
In their peewee league uniforms.

203
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:14,410
You know, he's never seen
one of their games.

204
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,823
He pay your way through med school?

205
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,907
Take a wild guess.

206
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:20,148
I don't care, though.
I've graduated now,

207
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:22,801
I've got a residency waiting
for me in New York city,

208
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:25,566
but Matthew won't let me
take the boys out of state.

209
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:29,477
Says he wants them close by,
these boys he sees once a month.

210
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:31,207
It's nothing but spite.

211
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:33,486
Now, look, we're gonna reschedule a hearing.

212
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:35,060
I'm sure everything is
going to work out fine.

213
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,455
You just have to be patient.

214
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:40,169
If I'm not at columbia presbyterian
8:00 A.M. Monday morning,

215
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:42,647
they will give my spot away.

216
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:49,931
That can't happen. I have worked too
hard to build a life for these boys.

217
00:10:57,258 --> 00:10:58,585
We can't tail the wife.

218
00:10:58,585 --> 00:11:00,145
It's what he wants, Denny.

219
00:11:00,145 --> 00:11:03,089
Can't do it. Not ethical.

220
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:04,221
She's a client, too.

221
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:05,741
What I would suggest

222
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:09,012
is we send a letter
of withdrawal to end-run the conflict,

223
00:11:09,012 --> 00:11:12,755
get an opinion letter of outside
counsel.../ I don't want to tail the wife.

224
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:17,097
Denny, I don't need to tell you
that Ernie dell is one of
our biggest clients.

225
00:11:17,097 --> 00:11:19,937
If he wants a private investigator,
what's the real harm?

226
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:22,237
The harm would be to me.

227
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:24,585
I'm sorry?

228
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:29,322
I'm the one sleeping with his wife.

229
00:11:38,969 --> 00:11:41,846
Denny is having an affair with the woman.

230
00:11:41,846 --> 00:11:43,735
I've got a senior partner
saying don't tail her,

231
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:46,361
I've got a client wanting snapshots.

232
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:48,797
What do I do, Paul?

233
00:11:50,482 --> 00:11:54,436
Convince Ernie that the private
investigator idea is a bad one.

234
00:11:54,436 --> 00:11:56,575
Oh, sure.

235
00:11:56,575 --> 00:12:00,410
You have enormous persuasive skills, Lori.

236
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,285
You're handling me.

237
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:04,296
I am.

238
00:12:04,296 --> 00:12:10,751
And I need you to handle Ernie.
I will handle Denny.

239
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:17,469
Tara?

240
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:18,994
Hi.

241
00:12:26,752 --> 00:12:28,801
Don't be offended by this.

242
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:35,292
I know you're a great lawyer
with exceptional legal skills.

243
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:36,787
And?

244
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:38,794
I need you to flirt with Ernie dell.

245
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:41,559
Excuse me? / The man is
a profound skirt chaser.

246
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:43,156
What's wrong with your skirt?

247
00:12:43,156 --> 00:12:45,585
Okay, look, men sometimes
find me attractive.

248
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:47,118
From time to time, they'll even hit on me.

249
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:50,964
It's all deeply rewarding, but you...

250
00:12:50,964 --> 00:12:53,146
What me?

251
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:55,219
You're hot.

252
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:59,514
Yeah. Kind of... nasty hot.

253
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:00,922
Men would leave their wives for you,

254
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:02,908
and I need to make Ernie
forget about his wife, so...

255
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,911
- If you think that I...
- Don't make me pull rank.

256
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:06,933
You can file your sexual
harrassment claim tomorrow,

257
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:11,488
but today, now, you need
to meet with Ernie.

258
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,833
It seems the client can't pay,

259
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:18,166
so the firm will have to eat the cost
of prosecuting this matter.

260
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,722
I'm sure the partners won't object

261
00:13:20,722 --> 00:13:22,967
when they hear that it was
a case you assigned to me.

262
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,295
I'll tell you what.

263
00:13:24,295 --> 00:13:28,978
I'll pay the cost of prosecuting the case.

264
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:33,022
Of course, if you were a betting man...

265
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:36,674
You win, I pay,
you lose, you pay.

266
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:39,137
Bit of a gamble, I realize.

267
00:13:39,137 --> 00:13:41,382
I'll pay double.

268
00:13:55,258 --> 00:13:56,257
You got another hearing?

269
00:13:56,257 --> 00:13:59,550
That's the good news.
The not-so-good news is
we probably won't win it.

270
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,596
But it at least gives us leverage
to get your ex-husband in a room.

271
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:03,456
Wait, wait.

272
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:05,165
What are you talking about?

273
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:07,225
We want to take a shot at a settlement.

274
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:10,485
Now, if your ex cares anything
about these kids... / He doesn't.

275
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:13,769
This is all about getting me.
Have I not been clear about that?

276
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,464
He doesn't even know the kids.

277
00:14:15,464 --> 00:14:17,251
I've dealt with bad ex-husbands before.

278
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:22,504
Mr. Chase, no offense, but
you have never dealt with this one.

279
00:14:22,504 --> 00:14:24,616
Trust me.

280
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:32,473
This is little orphan Annie,
for god's sake.

281
00:14:32,473 --> 00:14:33,686
If she doesn't look the part.

282
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:36,252
I didn't realize we did racial profiling
for ourcomic strip characters.

283
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:39,169
These are private investors.
There is no state action involved.

284
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,329
How would the story change
if Annie were black?

285
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:43,544
Your honor, are you serious?

286
00:14:43,544 --> 00:14:46,462
Counsel, we are talking
about adoption here.

287
00:14:46,462 --> 00:14:48,895
Daddy warbucks isn't the biological father.

288
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:50,490
Exactly how would the story change?

289
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,368
Little orphan Annie is
an iconic character based...

290
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:55,360
I want to see her.

291
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,772
- Excuse me?
- The girl who got the role.

292
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:58,841
I want to compare.

293
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:00,992
Your honor, is that really
fair to the other little girl?

294
00:15:00,992 --> 00:15:03,827
Counsel, if she can sing
eight times a week

295
00:15:03,827 --> 00:15:07,857
in front of 3,000-plus people a night,
she can sing in front of me.

296
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:10,288
Get her in here.

297
00:15:12,092 --> 00:15:15,368
I want the private investigator.

298
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:18,379
The thing is, Ernie, the photographs
will have no legal relevance.

299
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:20,565
They can't facilitate an annulment.

300
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:23,089
I am the customer here, Lori.

301
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,470
The customer isn't always right.

302
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:35,273
May I...

303
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:38,371
make an observation?

304
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,354
I really don't know you, Mr. Dell,

305
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:41,726
but I suspect there's a reason

306
00:15:41,726 --> 00:15:44,813
why all these younger women
want to marry you.

307
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:45,990
It's called money.

308
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,051
You're wrong.

309
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:50,536
It's called power,

310
00:15:50,536 --> 00:15:54,171
and you derive a lot of that power
not just from being handsome and...

311
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:55,955
sexy,

312
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,816
but from being dignified.

313
00:15:58,816 --> 00:16:02,619
Hiring a private investigator
is beneath you.

314
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:05,072
There are many young,
beautiful women out there

315
00:16:05,072 --> 00:16:10,662
who would love to jump into your...

316
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:14,067
Wife's place.

317
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:17,800
I know this sounds crazy, but...

318
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,378
you might want to look at this
as an opportunity.

319
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:43,274
Paul.

320
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:46,721
You and I go back a long way, Denny.

321
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:50,280
Completely mindful of the fact
that you helped build this place,

322
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:57,186
the partners here will not allow you
to dismantle it with your buffoonery.

323
00:16:57,186 --> 00:16:58,508
What did you say to me?

324
00:16:58,508 --> 00:17:02,506
I don't think you want
to hear me say it again.

325
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:06,863
To have an affair with the wife
of one of our biggest clients,

326
00:17:06,863 --> 00:17:11,173
it disrespects both Ernie dell
and this firm.

327
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:14,641
- We have other clients.
- Not like Ernie.

328
00:17:14,641 --> 00:17:17,755
But your point is well taken.

329
00:17:17,755 --> 00:17:23,609
Everybody is fungible.

330
00:17:34,978 --> 00:17:38,420
Lori colson won't tail my wife.

331
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,132
I want you to do it. / Ernie.

332
00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:42,317
I'm not talking to you.

333
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:46,104
Get it done, Denny.

334
00:17:57,804 --> 00:18:00,832
Denny, I'm having a bit of
an identity crisis.

335
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:03,604
I've always prided myself on being,

336
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:06,386
well... nuts.

337
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:12,148
But in this firm, I find myself falling
into the sane category.

338
00:18:16,353 --> 00:18:19,170
You think I'm nuts, do you?

339
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,704
Are you scared?

340
00:18:21,704 --> 00:18:23,529
Scared?

341
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:27,896
What would I be scared of?

342
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:30,121
Edwin poole is a friend.

343
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:33,690
You've seen him just go off the high dive.

344
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,560
Edwin poole's problem is he
doesn't like being Edwin poole.

345
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,295
From time to time, he'd...

346
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:41,076
look in the mirror and ask,

347
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:44,041
"what's the point?"
I never do that.

348
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,965
Questions like that'll kill you.

349
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:48,013
Questions like "what's the point?"

350
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:50,393
Look, take you for example.

351
00:18:50,393 --> 00:18:52,091
Tomorrow you're gonna go into court

352
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:53,846
and argue that some little fat black kid

353
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:57,006
should be able to play
a little skinny white one.

354
00:18:57,006 --> 00:19:00,023
What's the point?

355
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:05,566
You don't ask.
That's the point.

356
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:07,891
You're gonna win, by the way?

357
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:11,349
The world wants to know.

358
00:19:12,186 --> 00:19:14,760
I'm afraid not.

359
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,759
There's no state action.

360
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:21,069
We've asked for specific performance
with no clear evidence of discrimination.

361
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't like losing, especially
when there's a wager involved.

362
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,826
Well, don't, soldier.

363
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:32,551
Pull the rabbit out of your hat.

364
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:41,307
That's the secret of both
trial law and life.

365
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:43,407
Rabbits.

366
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:45,313
Yeah.

367
00:19:54,588 --> 00:19:55,833
Excuse me.

368
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,747
I'm looking for...

369
00:19:57,747 --> 00:20:01,082
you, actually. All my life.

370
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:02,739
Matthew.

371
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:04,004
Tara.

372
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:05,609
Alan.

373
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:10,741
I had a girl who looked like
you once, married her.

374
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:12,913
Now she looks like you.

375
00:20:12,913 --> 00:20:16,334
Where the hell is my lawyer?

376
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,749
If you took summer plus winter breaks,

377
00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:24,796
spring break, holiday weekends,

378
00:20:24,796 --> 00:20:27,033
you start to get pretty close
to what you have right now.

379
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:28,206
Pass.

380
00:20:28,206 --> 00:20:30,366
That's too much custody for super dad.

381
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:32,763
Is there any acceptable scenario

382
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:34,939
that would allow for Sharon
to enroll in her program

383
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:37,785
without leaving the boys behind?

384
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:40,591
We could each take one.

385
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:41,645
Excuse me?

386
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:44,804
You know, like that nazi movie
where the woman has
to pick which kid to keep.

387
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:47,001
Sophie's choice. / Thank you.

388
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:49,079
Only this is Sharon's choice.

389
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:51,331
One goes with her to New York,
I keep the other one.

390
00:20:51,331 --> 00:20:53,293
Done. / That's outrageous.

391
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,614
The boys love each other.

392
00:20:54,614 --> 00:20:55,811
They're best friends.

393
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:57,537
It's a little weird, don't you think?

394
00:20:57,537 --> 00:20:58,884
Let's see what happens
when we split them up.

395
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,491
Stop doing this!

396
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:03,993
You have already scarred your
children enough to last a lifetime.

397
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:06,193
Imagine how that feels to a little boy,

398
00:21:06,193 --> 00:21:08,938
knowing that their father could
care less whether he sees them or not.

399
00:21:08,938 --> 00:21:11,773
And yet if it means denying me
something that I want,

400
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:14,171
something that I deserve,
something that this family needs,

401
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:17,022
suddenly you're a, you're
a concerned father.

402
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:18,180
Damn you!

403
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,563
And what about my needs, huh?

404
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:23,401
What freakish nightmare did I step into
that turned my wife, who was hot,

405
00:21:23,401 --> 00:21:24,636
who had sex with me,

406
00:21:24,636 --> 00:21:28,035
who liked to go out with me at night
into some earth mother,

407
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:30,835
world record-setting breast feeder.

408
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:32,563
And now you wanna leave your kids

409
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:35,592
with some non-english-speaking
nanny for 100 hours a week

410
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:39,284
so you can live out your E.R
fantasy life? Be my guest.

411
00:21:39,284 --> 00:21:40,468
But it's not my problem

412
00:21:40,468 --> 00:21:47,637
that you're not good enough to get
hired anywhere in the entire state.

413
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,696
Denny,

414
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:05,329
you hire that P.I. yet?

415
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:07,101
I asked you a question.

416
00:22:07,101 --> 00:22:10,295
Truth be told, my relationship with
this firm hangs in the balance.

417
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,636
Uh, Ernie, why don't we
step into my office...

418
00:22:11,636 --> 00:22:13,484
I'm talking to Denny.

419
00:22:13,484 --> 00:22:15,698
All right, Ernie,

420
00:22:16,612 --> 00:22:20,507
truth time, my office.

421
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:24,139
This is not gonna be
easy for you to hear,

422
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:27,218
but it needs to be said.

423
00:22:27,984 --> 00:22:32,276
I don't give a damn who slept with
your wife. Neither do you, really.

424
00:22:32,276 --> 00:22:34,696
You don't love her.
This is an ego thing.

425
00:22:34,696 --> 00:22:38,505
She's a trophy girl,
something for your friends to admire.

426
00:22:38,505 --> 00:22:39,913
Maybe you should be flattered.

427
00:22:39,913 --> 00:22:41,997
I'm not... / I'm talking.

428
00:22:41,997 --> 00:22:43,857
Ego, Ernie.

429
00:22:43,857 --> 00:22:46,140
You acquire fast cars and young wives

430
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,308
to try and stay young yourself in the
hope of confusing youth with relevance.

431
00:22:50,308 --> 00:22:53,310
Well, here's a flash for you.

432
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:56,504
We're all desperate to be relevant.

433
00:22:56,504 --> 00:22:58,955
You're 76 years old.

434
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:01,166
Wanna feel you still mean something?

435
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:03,896
Move to Florida, punch a chad,
screw up an election.

436
00:23:03,896 --> 00:23:06,789
Don't go looking for affirmation

437
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:10,143
between the two artificial jugs
of a woman who married you for...

438
00:23:10,143 --> 00:23:13,449
gee, could it be your outstanding
sense of humor?

439
00:23:13,449 --> 00:23:18,766
Take a swing if you want to,
if it makes you feel better.

440
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,232
The guardian, Ad litem acknowledged
in her report in the last year

441
00:23:30,232 --> 00:23:33,055
Mr. Caldertook custody of the boys
only one weekend a month.

442
00:23:33,055 --> 00:23:35,808
Mr. Calder has been steeped in
a major work crisis at his company.

443
00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:38,435
I don't care if he's been
dismantling a nuclear weapon.

444
00:23:38,435 --> 00:23:40,815
The fact is he hasn't been there,

445
00:23:40,815 --> 00:23:44,363
and there's no doubt that my client is,
in practice, the primary custodian.

446
00:23:44,363 --> 00:23:47,201
Now, this woman is struggling to make
a life for a family he doesn't..

447
00:23:47,201 --> 00:23:48,599
Wait, she can't make it
in the commonwealth?

448
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,968
She'd love to, but the offer of
employment comes from New York.

449
00:23:50,968 --> 00:23:52,782
Now, my client has made every sacrifice.

450
00:23:52,782 --> 00:23:54,787
That's what parents do, Mr. Chase.

451
00:23:54,787 --> 00:23:57,097
You have kids, you make sacrifices.

452
00:23:57,097 --> 00:24:00,825
They got married here,
they had children here.

453
00:24:00,825 --> 00:24:04,326
Mr. Calder, as fathers go,

454
00:24:04,326 --> 00:24:07,574
I consider you a disgrace.

455
00:24:07,574 --> 00:24:10,726
Ms. Brant, there is a reason for this policy.

456
00:24:10,726 --> 00:24:14,463
We don't like angry spouses
yanking kids across state lines.

457
00:24:14,463 --> 00:24:17,540
It's an undue burden on the family unit.

458
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:25,069
Accordingly, your plan to relocate
with your sons remains enjoined.

459
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:35,941
What now?

460
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,940
I don't know.

461
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:43,442
I, uh...

462
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:47,099
I guess that didn't go too well.

463
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:54,620
When I'm stuck with a day
that's gray and lonely ¢Ü

464
00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:01,476
I just stick out my chin
and grin and say ¢Ü

465
00:25:01,476 --> 00:25:05,716
tomorrow, tomorrow, I love you, ¢Ü

466
00:25:05,716 --> 00:25:12,489
tomorrow, you're always a day away ¢Ü

467
00:25:12,489 --> 00:25:13,534
Thank you. That...

468
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:18,135
¢ÜTomorrow, tomorrow, I love you, ¢Ü

469
00:25:18,135 --> 00:25:28,070
tomorrow, you're always a day away ¢Ü

470
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:34,870
That was great.

471
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,336
Sarah, that was magnificent,

472
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:40,152
but the other little girl
was quite good, too,

473
00:25:40,152 --> 00:25:44,212
and given the discretion that has to be
allowed to producers in these situations..

474
00:25:44,212 --> 00:25:46,889
Your honor, we have something called
the equal protection clause,

475
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:48,778
we have something called
the 14th amendment.

476
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:50,857
I believe it's actually
required reading for judges.

477
00:25:50,857 --> 00:25:52,107
I could be wrong there.

478
00:25:52,107 --> 00:25:54,641
Could I be heard, your honor?

479
00:25:54,641 --> 00:25:56,561
I heard about this matter.

480
00:25:56,561 --> 00:25:59,801
I would like to address
this court on what I consider...

481
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:02,986
I'm sorry, reverend,
but you have no standing here.

482
00:26:02,986 --> 00:26:05,510
I have standing as an American citizen

483
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,836
speaking upon a civil rights violation.

484
00:26:07,836 --> 00:26:09,291
Reverend Sharpton I will
ask you to step down.

485
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:10,965
I am standing as Bobby kennedy was standing

486
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:13,132
on the steps of the courthouse in Alabama.

487
00:26:13,132 --> 00:26:17,197
No one is denying this little
girl an education, sir.

488
00:26:17,197 --> 00:26:18,895
She just can't play Annie.

489
00:26:18,895 --> 00:26:23,202
You may think this is a small matter,
but this is no small matter.

490
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:27,737
This child is being denied the right
to play an american icon

491
00:26:27,737 --> 00:26:30,911
because she doesn't match the description.

492
00:26:30,911 --> 00:26:35,145
Those descriptions were crafted 50 years ago.

493
00:26:35,145 --> 00:26:37,388
We supposed to be in a different day.

494
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:39,644
Reverend.../ You talk about
racial equality,

495
00:26:39,644 --> 00:26:41,615
how we're making progress.

496
00:26:41,615 --> 00:26:46,003
The problem with that progress is
it's always a day away.

497
00:26:46,003 --> 00:26:52,741
Tomorrow, tomorrow, you love that
because it's always a day away.

498
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:56,935
I'm here to stick out
my chin today, today.

499
00:26:56,935 --> 00:27:00,058
Give us an African-american spider-man.

500
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:03,417
Give us a black that can run
faster than a speeding bullet

501
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:06,963
and leap over tall buildings
in a single bound.

502
00:27:06,963 --> 00:27:09,448
Not tomorrow, today.

503
00:27:09,448 --> 00:27:12,565
Today. The sun needs to come out today,

504
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:15,137
not tomorrow, your honor.

505
00:27:15,137 --> 00:27:19,522
God almighty, give the American
people a black orphan Annie.

506
00:27:19,522 --> 00:27:26,224
It's just not good enough
to say she doesn't look the part.

507
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,390
That's what we call a rabbit, son.

508
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,581
Denny crane.

509
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:59,780
What if we file a TRO in Federal court
on behalf of the kids?

510
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,817
On what grounds?

511
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:04,754
I don't know. They've been denied
a right to interstate travel.

512
00:28:04,754 --> 00:28:07,254
That's dubious.

513
00:28:07,923 --> 00:28:10,755
But I like your thinking.

514
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:14,146
Come here for a second.

515
00:28:17,584 --> 00:28:19,573
Look...

516
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:22,331
I just...

517
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:25,936
I just need to know.

518
00:28:25,936 --> 00:28:27,545
Sally...

519
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,711
Brad.

520
00:28:51,175 --> 00:28:52,882
Alan.

521
00:28:58,532 --> 00:29:01,120
The deadbeat doesn't even see
his kids, doesn't know them,

522
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,924
and he's using them as weapons
to destroy his ex-wife and them.

523
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:12,704
And that's why you were so upset?

524
00:29:12,704 --> 00:29:15,710
The case?

525
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,976
It's a little hard, okay?

526
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:22,907
I, I prefer him in D.C.

527
00:29:25,008 --> 00:29:26,766
Do you think I should start
working out with weights,

528
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,516
maybe do some calisthenics?

529
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,834
- Internally express my...
- So like him?

530
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:34,101
Well, what context are
you asking this, Alan?

531
00:29:34,101 --> 00:29:36,892
I mean, are you asking this
like a boyfriend, or...

532
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:39,087
I'm not allowed to ask questions?

533
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:41,986
Am I? About Tara?

534
00:29:41,986 --> 00:29:44,542
What about Tara?

535
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,338
Nothing.

536
00:29:49,338 --> 00:29:56,691
Anyway, he left, I got very depressed,
drank a lot, hit on too many boys...

537
00:29:56,691 --> 00:29:59,803
until I met this one boy.

538
00:29:59,803 --> 00:30:02,245
Man.

539
00:30:02,245 --> 00:30:04,724
Distinguished.

540
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,257
And then I just...

541
00:30:12,106 --> 00:30:15,265
Okay, how small is the town
of Boston? / What?

542
00:30:15,265 --> 00:30:17,125
The dirtbag is right over there.

543
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,684
Bradley?

544
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:21,426
The ex-husband.

545
00:30:21,426 --> 00:30:25,447
Really trying to strengthen
that family unit.

546
00:30:27,668 --> 00:30:28,697
What are you doing?

547
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:33,961
I just need to use your thingy for a second.

548
00:30:34,538 --> 00:30:37,309
Can we get out of here?
I don't, I don't want to look at that pig.

549
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:38,539
Okay.

550
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:51,053
We're off.

551
00:30:54,157 --> 00:30:57,065
I told him we're all desperate
to be relevant.

552
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:58,673
Were you able to dissuade him?

553
00:30:58,673 --> 00:31:00,649
I think so.

554
00:31:03,562 --> 00:31:08,300
Denny, do you think you were talking
about yourself a little?

555
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,723
You're feeling a little desperate
to be relevant lately.

556
00:31:12,723 --> 00:31:16,118
Don't waste your time trying
to get in my head.

557
00:31:16,118 --> 00:31:19,400
There's nothing there.

558
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:22,491
They're not going to take
the firm from you.

559
00:31:22,491 --> 00:31:24,221
First, Paul lewiston could
never get the votes.

560
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:27,432
Second, he wouldn't want to.

561
00:31:27,432 --> 00:31:29,371
The man loves you.

562
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:33,417
I'm not worried, Lori.
Do I look worried?

563
00:31:34,112 --> 00:31:37,166
Yeah, look out there.

564
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:41,138
My domain.

565
00:31:42,682 --> 00:31:45,678
My city.

566
00:31:48,232 --> 00:31:51,552
I'm Denny crane.

567
00:32:01,442 --> 00:32:03,070
I would be happy to buzz Mr. Calder.

568
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,021
You're very kind, but,
look, I'm already here.

569
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:06,506
There's a meeting in progress, though,

570
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:08,621
and I've been instructed
not to disturb him.

571
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:09,629
Hello, Matthew.

572
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:10,741
Shame.

573
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:12,887
I was quite hoping to interrupt
something tawdry.

574
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:14,248
I'm Alan shore.

575
00:32:14,248 --> 00:32:15,686
Your colleague and I just met,

576
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:18,916
but we seem to share a proclivity
for exotic women and illicit behavior.

577
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:21,318
Can I steal you a second?

578
00:32:21,747 --> 00:32:22,705
What's going on?

579
00:32:22,705 --> 00:32:23,858
I'll keep it quick.

580
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,034
These are for you.

581
00:32:25,034 --> 00:32:27,008
Photos. Snapshots, really.

582
00:32:27,008 --> 00:32:29,445
Some delightful little business
between you and a hooker.

583
00:32:29,445 --> 00:32:30,719
Friend of mine, actually.

584
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:32,388
I earn frequent flyer miles.

585
00:32:32,388 --> 00:32:34,041
She's a lovely woman.

586
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:36,434
I arranged for her to seek you
out at the bar.

587
00:32:36,434 --> 00:32:39,628
I particularly like
that one, don't you?

588
00:32:39,628 --> 00:32:43,585
Gives your bottom a nice aura.
Here's the deal.

589
00:32:43,585 --> 00:32:47,317
Sharon and the kids get to go to
New York or I start printing copies.

590
00:32:47,317 --> 00:32:49,335
Is that powdered sugar, by the way,

591
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:52,929
that you're snorting off her
magnificent porcelain breasts?

592
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,103
You are a lawyer in a prestigious
law firm, for god's sake.

593
00:32:56,103 --> 00:32:57,808
I know. Awful.

594
00:32:57,808 --> 00:32:58,934
Hate to extort and run,

595
00:32:58,934 --> 00:33:02,591
but I'm afraid I'll need
an answer on this now.

596
00:33:07,954 --> 00:33:08,827
Tara.

597
00:33:09,163 --> 00:33:12,640
I need to apologize.
I know how degrading that
had to be with Ernie, and...

598
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,124
Not at all.
In fact, I slept with him last night.

599
00:33:16,124 --> 00:33:17,478
Anything for the team.

600
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:19,271
Yeah, I suppose I deserve that.

601
00:33:19,271 --> 00:33:21,687
This wasn't so much for the team
as it is for Denny.

602
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:24,299
- There's some stuff going on.
- What stuff?

603
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:28,605
Denny, I need another moment.

604
00:33:34,496 --> 00:33:39,495
I was thinking how right you are
not to hire a private investigator.

605
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:41,680
I thank you for your counsel.

606
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,276
After all, it's possible
that I might learn something

607
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:48,095
that could upset me even further.

608
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:50,659
I hadn't considered that.

609
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:52,637
Did you consider that, Denny?

610
00:33:52,637 --> 00:33:57,019
Ernie, I don't have time to consider
all the things I have to consider.

611
00:33:57,019 --> 00:33:59,539
Should we sit? / Oh, please.

612
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,801
See, the thing is,

613
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:05,173
the fool that I am,

614
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:09,683
I went out and hired a P.I. on my own,

615
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:12,422
and guess what I found out, Denny.

616
00:34:12,422 --> 00:34:13,701
I'm not sure, Ernie,

617
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:20,066
but you need to know that I'm billing
you for all these rhetorical questions.

618
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:30,193
My own lawyer...

619
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,503
My friend...

620
00:34:33,012 --> 00:34:37,033
with my wife.

621
00:34:39,438 --> 00:34:42,434
Gee, Denny crane is silent.

622
00:34:42,434 --> 00:34:46,121
Talk to me about my quest
for relevance, Denny.

623
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:48,665
Tell me about my ego.

624
00:34:48,665 --> 00:34:54,881
Come up with one last profound thing
to say before I pull this trigger.

625
00:34:54,881 --> 00:34:56,515
Come on, Denny, talk.

626
00:34:56,515 --> 00:35:02,613
I want to hear what the great
Denny crane has to say now.

627
00:35:05,356 --> 00:35:07,988
First off,

628
00:35:07,988 --> 00:35:11,323
clients come in here all the time
wanting to shoot me.

629
00:35:11,323 --> 00:35:12,782
You know what I tell them?

630
00:35:12,782 --> 00:35:15,321
Go ahead.

631
00:35:17,328 --> 00:35:21,417
The worst thing about growing older, Ernie,

632
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:23,414
you begin to slip.

633
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:25,344
One day you wake up and you're less than,

634
00:35:25,344 --> 00:35:28,939
and for me, I'm a legend, Ernie.

635
00:35:28,939 --> 00:35:30,679
I'm folklore in this town.

636
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:33,096
Lawyers have feared me for years.

637
00:35:33,096 --> 00:35:36,690
For Denny crane to slip,
it would diminish my legacy.

638
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,679
It would be a tragedy.

639
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,661
Denny crane has to go out big,
page one of the Globe.

640
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:47,355
New York times, even.
Do me a favor, Ernie.

641
00:35:48,556 --> 00:35:51,296
Pull the trigger.

642
00:35:51,296 --> 00:35:52,947
Immortalize the legend.

643
00:35:52,947 --> 00:35:54,466
Pull the trigger.

644
00:35:54,466 --> 00:35:56,847
I don't ever want to be less than.

645
00:35:56,847 --> 00:36:01,660
Don't let me become irrelevant.
Pull it.

646
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:03,502
Okay.

647
00:36:03,502 --> 00:36:05,751
But before I do,

648
00:36:05,751 --> 00:36:11,395
don't you at least want to apologize?

649
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:13,534
I do.

650
00:36:13,534 --> 00:36:17,108
I'm sorry, my friend.

651
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:21,648
I'm truly sorry.

652
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,640
Ernie, uh,

653
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:35,461
that gun, I bought it
for you, remember?

654
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:39,434
It's a starter pistol, Ernie.

655
00:36:54,808 --> 00:36:57,057
It's a controversy.
That's what Al sharpton does,

656
00:36:57,057 --> 00:36:59,104
and he does it well.
He doesn't just make noise.

657
00:36:59,104 --> 00:37:01,819
He lights and carries a torch
of racial controversy. / Mr. Shore...

658
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,790
Which you know,
which is why you're here.

659
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,012
We need to put this one out, good people.

660
00:37:06,012 --> 00:37:08,567
Controversy is bad business for musicals.

661
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:13,222
Your production will open and close
faster than you can say trent lott.

662
00:37:13,222 --> 00:37:17,110
I assume you've come with
a proposal. Let's have it.

663
00:37:18,782 --> 00:37:20,457
Sarah?

664
00:37:22,328 --> 00:37:26,698
When I'm stuck with
a day that ¢Ü/ Okay.

665
00:37:26,698 --> 00:37:31,428
We'll offer you the role
of understudy on weekends.

666
00:37:31,428 --> 00:37:35,728
- Plus three matinees a month.
- Done.

667
00:37:35,728 --> 00:37:37,434
Sarah?

668
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:55,236
He pulled a gun on him.

669
00:37:55,236 --> 00:37:58,235
It only shot blanks, but, yeah.

670
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:00,611
Drama's over.

671
00:38:03,006 --> 00:38:06,887
How's it feel being back?

672
00:38:06,887 --> 00:38:09,096
It's all right.

673
00:38:11,598 --> 00:38:13,246
Let me ask you a question.

674
00:38:13,246 --> 00:38:15,453
I'd appreciate an honest answer.

675
00:38:15,453 --> 00:38:17,342
Okay.

676
00:38:17,342 --> 00:38:21,044
Do you think I talk too fast?

677
00:38:24,306 --> 00:38:29,492
Sometimes you're a little brisk.

678
00:38:29,492 --> 00:38:32,984
I think it's good business practice,
not to mention good business ethics.

679
00:38:32,984 --> 00:38:35,574
We charge by the hour.
Our clients pay for the time
that we spend talking.

680
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:37,638
As attorneys, we have an obligation
not to overbill our clients,

681
00:38:37,638 --> 00:38:41,467
so if I talk fast,
it's just because I feel...

682
00:38:41,467 --> 00:38:44,196
ethically bound.

683
00:38:44,896 --> 00:38:46,679
He makes fun of me.

684
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:48,031
I'm sorry?

685
00:38:48,031 --> 00:38:49,864
Shore.

686
00:38:50,124 --> 00:38:53,412
Thinks I'm a Ken doll.

687
00:38:54,477 --> 00:38:57,294
No, it's not right.
He calls me a Ken doll, while he...

688
00:38:57,294 --> 00:39:00,355
plays with your barbie?

689
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,643
Excuse me.

690
00:39:02,643 --> 00:39:03,631
Hi.

691
00:39:03,631 --> 00:39:05,008
Sharon.

692
00:39:05,008 --> 00:39:08,111
I just, I just came to say thank you,

693
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:10,717
not that I agree with your tactics,

694
00:39:10,717 --> 00:39:16,683
but what this means to me and,
and my children...

695
00:39:16,683 --> 00:39:23,706
Well, thank you so much.
I will never forget this.

696
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:36,769
Remember that book,

697
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:41,178
"one flew over
the cuckoo's nest"? / Yes.

698
00:39:44,157 --> 00:39:49,008
Is there a point, or did you just
want to know if I'd read it?

699
00:39:49,008 --> 00:39:53,978
There you go again, always
looking for a point.

700
00:39:55,788 --> 00:39:59,820
Matthew calder just agreed to let his
wife move with their children.

701
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,677
Fantastic.

702
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:04,913
You got pictures of him with a hooker.
You blackmailed him.

703
00:40:04,913 --> 00:40:06,772
You make it sound unsavory.

704
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:07,816
Listen to me.

705
00:40:07,816 --> 00:40:11,442
I know how you practice law.
I don't practice law like that.

706
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:14,375
It was a rabbit.
Well, really a bunny.

707
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:17,139
Marines don't like bunnies?

708
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:19,453
You know, the only reason
I don't report you to the bar myself...

709
00:40:19,453 --> 00:40:22,146
is because Sharon might not be able
to go to New York with her children,

710
00:40:22,146 --> 00:40:28,430
which, shockingly, is more important
than our combined ethical egos.

711
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,663
You know what, sport?

712
00:40:29,663 --> 00:40:32,184
You and I, now...

713
00:40:32,184 --> 00:40:35,559
officially have a relationship.

714
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,922
Great.

715
00:40:36,922 --> 00:40:40,142
Perhaps we can get together
and do a couple of push-ups...

716
00:40:40,142 --> 00:40:42,574
Sport.

717
00:41:00,345 --> 00:41:02,597
Hooker rabbit.

718
00:41:02,597 --> 00:41:04,927
I love it.

719
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:09,162
You know, you never answered
my question the other night.

720
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:11,183
Which was?

721
00:41:11,183 --> 00:41:14,097
Are you scared?

722
00:41:19,302 --> 00:41:23,450
Only thing to be scared of,
son, is tomorrow.

723
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,820
I don't live for tomorrow.

724
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,713
Never saw the farther.

725
00:41:32,772 --> 00:41:34,909
Denny crane...

726
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,795
What was that?

727
00:41:38,726 --> 00:41:40,683
Nothing.

728
00:41:40,683 --> 00:41:44,012
Here's to no tomorrows.
