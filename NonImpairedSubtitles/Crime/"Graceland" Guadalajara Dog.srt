Uh, yeah, you too.
It's Mike.

484
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,185
You fresh out of Quantico?

485
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:13,355
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh, at ease, soldier.

486
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,291
Still making
no headway with Bobby?

487
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:17,426
Nothing. I'm two weeks under
with him,

488
00:20:17,494 --> 00:20:18,828
and all he wants to do
is get under me.

489
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:20,229
Ugh.

490
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:21,564
Wait, is that what
the birth control pills are for?

491
00:20:21,632 --> 00:20:23,233
I'm not taking them.

492
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,972
Well, your agency
doesn't expect you to, um...

493
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,640
I'm not gonna screw him.

494
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,943
The pills are for Bobby.

495
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:33,877
You give a guy
a couple of these,

496
00:20:33,944 --> 00:20:35,478
and his soldier's at ease.

497
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:36,980
- Really?
- Really.

498
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:38,647
Ugh, thank God.
I can't take this anymore.

499
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:39,815
Gross.

500
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:41,150
Well, can I ask you a question?

501
00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:43,218
I mean, you're going under
as his girlfriend.

502
00:20:43,286 --> 00:20:47,489
Don't you kind of
expect him to want to, um,

503
00:20:47,557 --> 00:20:50,859
well, you know...
Wanna get with you?

504
00:20:50,926 --> 00:20:53,328
- Absolutely.
- Why don't you get out?

505
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:55,163
Because I want the bastard.

506
00:20:55,231 --> 00:20:57,532
Okay, mama,
there's a lot in here.

507
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,167
- Thanks, Charlie.
- Good luck.

508
00:20:59,235 --> 00:21:01,737
It was nice to meet you, Mike.

509
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:03,839
[Door opens]

510
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:07,709
Told you you'd like her.

511
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,091
You cannot be a thug
wearing beads.

512
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:24,660
I didn't get the memo.

513
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:26,294
- What, you moving up?
- [Chuckles] No.

514
00:21:26,362 --> 00:21:28,029
I still haven't met Bello,

515
00:21:28,097 --> 00:21:29,231
but I'm close to one
of his lieutenants, Eddie.

516
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:30,832
- What's he about?
- A little Jekyll,

517
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,833
you know, a little Hyde.

518
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:32,934
He's an affable dude,

519
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:34,035
but he can turn on you
in a heartbeat.

520
00:21:34,103 --> 00:21:36,972
- Sounds just like me.
- Oh, yeah.

521
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,073
Is there anything
your Malaysian contacts have

522
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:39,708
that Bello might want?

523
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:41,577
No. No.

524
00:21:41,645 --> 00:21:43,712
My guys are heavy into mink
and lanolin oil.

525
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,348
Any of Bello's crew
like to wear fur?

526
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,750
Not that I know of.

527
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:49,519
- Oh, incoming.
- You guys talking about Bello?

528
00:21:49,586 --> 00:21:50,653
I think I got something
that might help.

529
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:51,754
Come on in, Mike.

530
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:53,088
So one of the things

531
00:21:53,156 --> 00:21:54,189
Bello's looking for
is firepower, right?

532
00:21:54,257 --> 00:21:56,224
I see you read my case file.

533
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:59,027
Jakes just scored a thousand
armor-piercing bullets.

534
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:00,495
You think Bello
would be into that?

535
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:02,463
Continue.

536
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,598
You tell Bello that
you got a guy at camp Pendleton

537
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,067
with the bullets... a marine.
That'd be you.

538
00:22:07,134 --> 00:22:09,803
- I've got the look, right?
- You do.

539
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:11,638
So we borrow the bullets
from Jakes

540
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,173
and sell them
to one of Bello's guys.

541
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:14,875
- Eddie, mm-hmm.
- Eddie.

542
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:16,744
Arrest Eddie, flip him,

543
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:19,013
and make him
bring you to Bello.

544
00:22:19,081 --> 00:22:20,515
Ah, and you started off
so strong.

545
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,583
It's too risky.
There's too many moving pieces.

546
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:24,352
If it got back to Bello,
I'd be dead.

547
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,154
But I appreciate the effort.
It's a work in progress.

548
00:22:26,222 --> 00:22:28,356
I'll think about it.

549
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:37,232
Hey, stranger.
What you doing home?

550
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:39,567
Charlie and Mike
helped me spike Bobby's drink.

551
00:22:39,635 --> 00:22:41,336
[Chuckles]
The dreaded spike, huh?

552
00:22:41,404 --> 00:22:44,372
- Mm-hmm.
- Couldn't get it up, huh?

553
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,108
Nope. He got embarrassed
and kicked me out.

554
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:48,176
Third time.
Yeah.

555
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:50,512
You know, at some point,
the guy's gonna stop drinking.

556
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,381
I know. And then what?
I seriously hate this case.

557
00:22:53,449 --> 00:22:54,716
He's not giving me anything.

558
00:22:54,784 --> 00:22:56,285
He won't talk business
in front of a woman.

559
00:22:56,352 --> 00:22:57,386
Right.

560
00:22:57,454 --> 00:23:00,322
Well, you know,
ease your way out.

561
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:03,825
I should.
But I want him.

562
00:23:03,893 --> 00:23:04,860
I mean, he's such a pig.

563
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:08,496
- Hmm.
- But you're right.

564
00:23:08,564 --> 00:23:12,466
This won't end well for me.

565
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:16,303
You know, I do still have
a connection with Bobby's crew.

566
00:23:16,371 --> 00:23:18,172
II can't ask you to do that.

567
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,307
You know I owe you plenty.

568
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:23,477
And you didn't ask.

569
00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:28,416
- Thanks, Paul.
- Yeah.

570
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,897
[Knocks on door] Enter.

571
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:44,933
I thought about it.
Your plan's awesome.

572
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:46,301
We get rolling in the morning.

573
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:47,969
What changed?

574
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:50,005
Mm, told you.
Thought about it.

575
00:23:50,072 --> 00:23:52,841
Tell Jakes.

576
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:08,781
Hey, Jakes,
can I ask you something?

577
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:10,817
- Yeah, man, go ahead.
- Those 5.7s.

578
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:12,418
- Have you filed them yet?
- No.

579
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,219
Would you mind
if I borrowed them?

580
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:15,754
Are you out
of your goddamn mind?

581
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:18,090
It's only for the day.
Briggs will sign for 'em.

582
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:19,992
You think that makes me
feel better?

583
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,397
Look, levi, one of these
gets out on the streets,

584
00:24:24,465 --> 00:24:26,799
happens to penetrate
the body armor

585
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:29,602
and chest cavity
of an LAPD officer,

586
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,470
I'll be in jail,
getting penetrated

587
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:33,039
in a different cavity,
you feel me?

588
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:34,040
I'll trade you.

589
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:35,174
What do you want?

590
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:38,345
I want you to leave me alone.

591
00:24:38,412 --> 00:24:41,014
I'll do your next round
on the chore wheel.

592
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:42,349
Jakes, come on, man.

593
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:44,318
Let these bullets
do some good in the world

594
00:24:44,385 --> 00:24:48,856
before they're destroyed.
Hmm?

595
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:52,125
All right,
I'll tell you what, levi.

596
00:24:52,193 --> 00:24:54,194
Two.
Two turns on the wheel.

597
00:24:54,262 --> 00:24:56,396
Done.

598
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:58,198
How many rounds you gonna need?

599
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:01,334
All of 'em.

600
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:03,069
[Indistinct chatter]

601
00:25:03,136 --> 00:25:04,404
[Laughs]

602
00:25:04,471 --> 00:25:06,505
We got G.I. Joe
in the house, guys.

603
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:08,340
Reporting for duty, sir.

604
00:25:08,408 --> 00:25:10,142
Right off
the recruitment poster.

605
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,277
Reservist with
the 316th quartermaster company

606
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,679
- at Pendleton.
- Mmhmm.

607
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:14,513
[Southern accent] Manufacturer
donated some bullets

608
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:16,014
for live fire testing.

609
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:17,550
Not all of 'em made it
to the range.

610
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:19,085
Dig it.
Don't depart from it.

611
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:21,120
Now, look, the bureau boys
worked hard

612
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:22,655
to get this backstop for you.

613
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:24,323
If Eddie or Bello has
the ability to check,

614
00:25:24,391 --> 00:25:25,658
which I highly doubt,
it'll come up

615
00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:27,326
that you're registered
with the 316th.

616
00:25:27,394 --> 00:25:29,161
Expectin' to see
Bello today, sir?

617
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:30,696
No, no.
It's gonna be Eddie's show.

618
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:32,165
Bello steers clear
of the indictable stuff.

619
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:33,499
Sure.

620
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:34,734
But what is up
with that accent?

621
00:25:34,802 --> 00:25:36,903
Felt quite natural
for the character.

622
00:25:36,971 --> 00:25:39,606
Oh, listen, Mike, you're not
playing curly in <i>Oklahoma,</i>okay?

623
00:25:39,674 --> 00:25:40,707
If it doesn't flow out of you
second nature,

624
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:41,708
you should drop it.

625
00:25:41,776 --> 00:25:43,443
Dropped.

626
00:25:43,511 --> 00:25:45,178
Now, we're gonna have audio
on both of us.

627
00:25:45,246 --> 00:25:46,413
Okay.

628
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:48,549
You and I will go in
with 50 rounds of ammo,

629
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:49,917
test some of the bullets,
and get out of there.

630
00:25:49,984 --> 00:25:51,251
We'll make the sale later

631
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,187
when the odds aren't
so stacked against us.

632
00:25:53,255 --> 00:25:55,189
All right, guys, check it out.

633
00:25:55,256 --> 00:25:57,557
Found a spot a block away
from where you guys are.

634
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:58,792
Closest we can get.

635
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,260
No visual inside, though,

636
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:02,663
so no sniper love for you guys.

637
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,964
Well, what's the signal
if something goes wrong?

638
00:26:04,032 --> 00:26:08,535
How 'bout "oh, sh... "?

639
00:26:08,603 --> 00:26:11,738
That's good.

640
00:26:11,806 --> 00:26:13,439

00:34:01,068 --> 00:34:02,602
Mike Warren.
Can I talk to Juan?

801
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,138
Sorry, Mike, he's out.
I can give him a message.

802
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:07,007
Tell him it's about
Paul Briggs, and it's important.

803
00:34:07,075 --> 00:34:09,542
Thanks, Katie.

804
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:22,290
Excuse me, I'm with
the L.A. county animal control.

805
00:34:22,357 --> 00:34:24,158
Don't worry,
I'm not shutting it down.

806
00:34:24,226 --> 00:34:26,027
- What?
- Animal...

807
00:34:28,231 --> 00:34:33,067
Ah, my man.
Thanks.

808
00:34:33,135 --> 00:34:34,202
Oh-ho.

809
00:34:34,269 --> 00:34:37,071
Chili cheese.
You naughty boy.

810
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,406
Thank you.

811
00:34:38,474 --> 00:34:39,974
I thought we were in a hurry.

812
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:42,276
Yeah, we were.
Now we're right on schedule.

813
00:34:42,344 --> 00:34:43,678
For what?

814
00:34:43,745 --> 00:34:46,748
Do you trust me, Mike?
Be honest.

815
00:34:46,815 --> 00:34:48,282
No, sir.

816
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,484
Hmm.

817
00:34:50,552 --> 00:34:51,986
You know what a heat run is?

818
00:34:52,054 --> 00:34:53,787
I know you do
because it's in the book.

819
00:34:53,855 --> 00:34:56,990
A heat run is
when someone makes a series

820
00:34:57,058 --> 00:34:58,726
of random turns
and speed changes

821
00:34:58,793 --> 00:35:00,161
- in order to avoid a tail.
- Mmhmm.

822
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:01,996
- I love it.
- You like that?

823
00:35:02,063 --> 00:35:05,566
- Mmhmm. - Verbatim.
I'm impressed.

824
00:35:05,634 --> 00:35:08,836
Now, you know our boy Eddie.

825
00:35:08,904 --> 00:35:11,038
He just bought $1/2 million
in illegal ammo

826
00:35:11,106 --> 00:35:12,640
and also switched
his license plates.

827
00:35:12,707 --> 00:35:14,842
You think, uh,
maybe he's making a heat run

828
00:35:14,909 --> 00:35:16,177
to make sure nobody
follows him back

829
00:35:16,244 --> 00:35:18,679
to our fellow Bello?
He should.

830
00:35:18,747 --> 00:35:20,748
Yeah, he is.
Bet your ass on it.

831
00:35:20,816 --> 00:35:23,451
Eat your chili cheese dog.

832
00:35:25,687 --> 00:35:27,354
It's good, huh?

833
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:29,756
- Yeah, it's good.
- Told you.

834
00:35:29,824 --> 00:35:32,892
I've been in with these guys
for a couple of months now.

835
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,728
The driver, Eddie,
idiot that he is,

836
00:35:35,796 --> 00:35:37,196
he always makes
the same exact heat run.

837
00:35:37,264 --> 00:35:39,798
Same turns, same cutbacks.
Never varies.

838
00:35:39,866 --> 00:35:41,200
Well, that's pointless.

839
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:43,202
Yeah, it is kinda pointless,

840
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:47,172
but it damn sure
makes our day shorter.

841
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,673
Because you know
where he's going.

842
00:35:48,741 --> 00:35:50,909
Mmhmm.
Matter of fact,

843
00:35:50,977 --> 00:35:54,713
they should be over there
in three,

844
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:56,982

Ah, there they are.
Must have hit a light.

848
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:14,565
Okay, is the tac team
gonna hit 'em now?

849
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:17,635
No, tac team's
not gonna hit 'em.

Wait, who are they?

857
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:34,252
Oh, that's, uh,
Bobby Moi's guys.

858
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,586
That's Paige's guy?

859
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:38,289
Mmhmm. The same.
Mr. Limpdick.

860

Get out!

- Spread your legs.

- Are we arresting them?

Well, I mean, you know,
if you want to waltz over there,

866
00:36:50,737 --> 00:36:52,237
whip out your badge
and expose yourself

867
00:36:52,305 --> 00:36:54,540
as a federal agent
in front of all those weapons...

868
00:36:54,608 --> 00:36:56,275
No, sir.

869
00:36:56,343 --> 00:36:59,245
All right.
I mean, are you sure?

870
00:36:59,313 --> 00:37:01,181
I mean, we are witnessing
a violent crime

in progress, agent Warren.

872

a citizen's arrest or something,

I get it.

Yeah, of course.

Hey, I've seen you before.

885
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:44,625
Yeah, I was in here
the other night with my girl.

Oh, yeah.

- Pretty little Italian piece.
- Mmhmm.

Great.
Now we all know each other.

Why didn't you tell me
this was your plan?

You said it yourself
back in the jeep.

You don't trust me.

906

So who were you calling back
at the hot dog stand anyway?

I thought maybe for a second

910
00:38:49,225 --> 00:38:50,291
you were tempted to call
our little plan in

911
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:51,426
to the bureau or something.

912

- I was tempted.
- Hmm.

913

But I didn't.

914
00:38:55,631 --> 00:38:57,833
But what if you had
called it in and crashed it?

You know, this only worked
because all of it worked.

Yeah, but anything
could have gone wrong.

over it.

from you.

and you and I,

But that's not why you called.

No, I called because
I thought he was making a play.
