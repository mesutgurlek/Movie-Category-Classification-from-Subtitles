Yeah.

156

A single's
from the free throw line.

157
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:05,816
Right. And a double's
from the top of the key.

158
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:08,152
You can't shoot
from the same place twice.

159
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:11,990
A triple's from back here, and
a home run's from behind the meatballs.

So, let me get this straight.
This is a single, right ?

166
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:33,081
Yeah, and a home run's
behind the meatballs.

when l'm shooting.

to make you miss your shot.

- Okay, guys, second and third.

This could bring him home.

448
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:52,086
Ted Denslow was a hero because
his vision brought BASEketball...

449
00:23:52,162 --> 00:23:54,392
from neighborhood driveways
into big arenas,

450
00:23:54,465 --> 00:23:56,990
but more importantly,
into the hearts and TVs of America.

451
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:59,001
- lt's a very sad day.
- Yee-ha !

452
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:01,469
His untimely death casts an unbearable
pall over an otherwise sweet victory.

453
00:24:01,538 --> 00:24:03,403
- Hey, yeah !
- And all of our hearts...

- Go, Dallas !

Winter's Warm Douche M.V.P. trophy.

456
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,407
What's your take
on this stunning upset ?

457
00:24:12,483 --> 00:24:15,145
The whole key to this game
was when l psyched out Coop.

458
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:17,653
No doubt about it.
And all you people watching--

459
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:20,155
l can't believe this guy.
He didn't psych me out.

460
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,784
lf anyone should get the psych-out,
it should be Denslow.

461
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,490
- Dude, weak.
- Coop, l know this is
a dark time for you,

462
00:24:27,564 --> 00:24:30,124
but l'd like to get your thoughts
on what happened today.

463
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,603
Well, Tim, today l lost
the big game and a dear friend.

464
00:24:34,671 --> 00:24:38,107
Um, l'm feeling
pretty vulnerable right now.

465
00:24:38,175 --> 00:24:41,611
l don't think l should be alone.
l really need people to talk--

466
00:24:41,678 --> 00:24:45,307
lt certainly does seem to be
raining shit on Joe Cooper right now.

467
00:24:45,382 --> 00:24:48,681
On paper, the Beers
had the far superior team.

468
00:24:48,752 --> 00:24:52,279
With the outside shooting of Coop
and the deadly accuracy of Doug Remer,

469
00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:54,290
what happened out there ?

470
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:56,349
Well, you know,
it was a team effort,

471
00:24:56,426 --> 00:24:59,361
and l guess it took every player
working together to lose this one.

472
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:01,522
Thanks, Doug. And so--

- Hey ! You wanna do
an interview with me ?
- No.

So another BASEketball championship
is in the books.

475
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:10,932

for the Beers.

to sick and dying kids, right ?

a nosy bitch who lives up the street,

1465
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:11,532
he took with him only
a toothbrush, a wallet,

1466
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:15,102
a steamer trunk
and a plane ticket to Calcutta.

Police theorize several possible
scenarios of what happened...

to the man affectionately
known to the world as ''Coop.''

the hell he is.

1470
01:19:23,822 --> 01:19:27,349
For all l care, he could be hanging
by his neck in his fuckin' closet.

1471
01:19:27,426 --> 01:19:29,951
Scenario Number One: He's hanging
by his neck in his fucking closet.

1472
01:19:34,566 --> 01:19:37,899
The night before his disappearance,
Coop's girlfriend had paid him a visit.

1473
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:40,495
According to friends,
they had quarreled.

1474
01:19:40,572 --> 01:19:43,837
lf you're looking for Joe Cooper,
l suggest you look wherever you find...

1475
01:19:43,909 --> 01:19:48,573
the most heinous, blatant and vile
exploitation of children on the planet.

1476
01:19:48,647 --> 01:19:52,777
Scenario Number Two:
Coop went to Disney World.

1477
01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:00,219
Here's a photograph of Joe Cooper taken
just days before his disappearance.

Here's a computer-enhanced simulation
of what he might look like today.

[ Michaels ] From Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
on the shores of Lake Michigan,

1480
01:20:10,535 --> 01:20:14,369
it's the Denslow Cup, where
the defending champion Dallas Felons...

1481
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:18,102
meet their perennial challengers
the Milwaukee Beers.

1482

Hello, l'm Al Michaels
along with Bob Costas inviting you...

for Denslow Cup V.

1484

And we're in for
a classic battle tonight.

1485
01:20:27,452 --> 01:20:29,420
You're absolutely right
about that, Al.

1486
01:20:29,488 --> 01:20:33,049
We have over a hundred million
people throughout the world
tuned in to see this game.

1487
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:36,253
Many of them, of course, with no
understanding of the sport itself,

1488
01:20:36,328 --> 01:20:40,594
but nonetheless fascinated
by the flickering images
and the bright, pretty colors.

High up in the stands, pyrotechnic

halftime fireworks display.

All right, you guys.
You ready to kick some ass ?

What's wrong, you guys ?
Why the long faces ?

1493
01:20:58,483 --> 01:21:00,815
We miss Coop.
Can't win without him.

1494

We don't need Coop.
l'll lead you to victory !

1495
01:21:04,156 --> 01:21:07,216
We're supposed to be a team.
Without Coop it's not the same.

1496
01:21:07,292 --> 01:21:09,920
Look, even if Coop
was to walk in here right now,

1497
01:21:09,995 --> 01:21:11,929
it wouldn't change
the outcome of this game one iota.

Are you with me ?
- Yeah, yeah !

We're underway here for Denslow Cup V.

[ Costas ] A stunned crowd of
over 18,000 witnessing the Beers...

1503

being thoroughly dominated by
the Felons. Come on, Beers ! Go, Coop !

- Oh, come on, Miss Reed.
lt's the Denslow Cup !

These are not the kind of people
to be looked up to or emulated.

[ Robert Stack ] The severed and
mutilated head was postmarked Denver.

The owner still has not
stepped forward.

1509
01:22:17,429 --> 01:22:21,627
Update: The disappearance of
the Milwaukee Beers BASEketball star.

1510
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:25,864
When Joe Cooper discovered that
the workers in the Beerswear
Factory were youngsters,

1511
01:22:25,937 --> 01:22:29,202
not even old enough for prostitution,
he personally flew to Calcutta.

1512
01:22:29,274 --> 01:22:32,869
His new, all-adult workforce
now makes a decent wage,

1513
01:22:32,944 --> 01:22:36,038
enjoys full medical benefits
and in-house child care.

1514
01:22:36,114 --> 01:22:40,551
All of us here are glad
that such a terrific human being
like Joe Cooper has returned.
