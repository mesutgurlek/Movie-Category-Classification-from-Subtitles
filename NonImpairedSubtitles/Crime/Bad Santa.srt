1
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,719
Hey, can I get another drink
down here?

2
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,880
I've been to prison once.

3
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:32,481
I've been married twice.

4
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,823
I was once drafted by
Lyndon Johnson and had to live

5
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:38,990
in shit-ass Mexico for two
and a half years for no reason.

6
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,660
I've had my eye socket
punched in, a kidney taken out,

7
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:46,296
and I got a bone chip in my
ankle that's never gonna heal.

8
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:50,203
I've seen some pretty shitty
situations in my life.

9
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,609
But nothing has ever sucked
more ass than this.

10
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,176
If I'd known I was gonna have to
put up with screaming brats

11
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,218
pissing on my lap for 30 days
out of the year,

12
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,914
I would have killed myself
a long time ago.

13
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,916
Come to think of it,
I still might.

14
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,890
Where I come from,
we didn't celebrate Christmas.

15
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,127
Not because we were Jewish,
but because my dad

16
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:18,102
was a worthless-coward fucking
asshole whose idea of a present

17
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,833
was a daily punch
to the back of the head.

18
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,501
He did teach me
how to crack a safe, though.

19
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:28,347
My dad never did shit with his
life, so he took it out on me.

20
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:31,474
You could say I'm no different.
I'd have to say you were right.

21
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,145
But at this point,
it's too late to start over.

22
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,211
Funny how things work out.

23
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,587
It's fucking hilarious.

24
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,012
There's Santa Claus.
Look there.

25
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,786
Wow.

26
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,152
Oh, my.
What a darling photo.

27
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,128
Are you certain you only want
the single?

28
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,394
Additional photos come in handy
as gifts for Grandma and Grandpa

29
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,832
or as a wonderful remembrance
for friends.

30
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:23,926
Gee.
You know what?

31
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,971
This one, I think it's more
than enough.

32
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,872
Thanks.
Merry Christmas.

33
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,409
So, what do you want,
little girl?

34
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,274
A drum set.

35
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,211
Oh, the old man will love that.

36
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,511
Okay. Fine.
See you later.

37
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,785
I saw you at another mall.

38
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,658
Well, I'm very happy for you.

39
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,561
You're not really Santa.

40
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,930
If you were Santa,
you could do magic.

41
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,026
You want to see some magic?

42
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,435
Here.
Let's watch you disappear.

43
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,573
Watch the bladder, kid.
Santa's got to pee.

44
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,633
- What do you want?
- A new bike.

45
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,679
Wow. That's a new one.
Excellent.

46
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,043
Attention, shoppers.

47
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,843
The store will be closing
in five minutes.

48
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,645
We hope tomorrow is
a pleasant Christmas.

49
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,980
Thank you for shopping with us.

50
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,612
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's the last one.

51
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,918
Thank the fuck Christ.

52
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,559
Jesus, Mother Mary, and Joseph.

53
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,822
You pissed yourself.

54
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,191
Aw, Jesus.

55
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,795
Yeah, all right.

56
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,430
Yeah.

57
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,735
Hey, happy holidays.
All right.

58
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,369
Merry Christmas.

59
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,471
Happy holidays.

60
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:43,742
Get home safe.

61
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,443
Yeah, okay.

62
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:46,815
I don't care what he says.

63
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,047
- We're going out for a beer.
- What the fuck?

64
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,181
I'll get right back to you.

65
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,691
What the hell's wrong with you?
I'm trying to fucking leave.

66
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,091
Pants are awful baggy.

67
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,129
You got anything in there?

68
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,926
Yeah. My dick.
You want to see it?

69
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,335
Keep pushing me.

70
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,268
I got my eyes on you.

71
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,067
All the time.

72
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,930
Ready.

73
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,100
Jesus.

74
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,115
- How's it going?
- I'm finished when I'm finished.

75
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,448
I'm going back upstairs.

76
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,352
I need a melon baller
and a loofah.

77
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,988
Got it.

78
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,288
Fuck the loofah.
Let's go.

79
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,129
Marcus, you get the loofah?

80
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,765
Drive.

81
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,177
Oh!

82
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,253
Oh, I'm dizzy.
Put me down.

83
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,313
Hey, put me down.

84
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,155
Come on!
Put me down.

85
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,196
Oh, come on.

86
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,292
Oh, man.

87
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,496
Hey, baby, two more of these,
all right?

88
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,667
No.
That's it for me.

89
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,837
You can't drink worth a shit,
you know that?

90
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,547
I weigh 92 pounds, you dick.

91
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,482
Come on. One more.
It's a celebration.

92
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,689
Here's to you.

93
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,361
You're getting worse,
you know that?

94
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,528
Well, at least I got it open.

95
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,538
It took you long enough.

96
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:30,269
I remember when you could unlock
a lock like it was nothing.

97
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,438
Yeah, well, you don't have to
worry about me anymore.

98
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,572
I'm out.

99
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,378
Bullshit.

100
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,784
Bullshit, my ass.

101
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,720
We just made $ 111,000
in one night.

102
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,453
Exactly. I figure I got enough
to go to Miami.

103
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,961
And do what?

104
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,553
I don't know. Shit.
Get a car.

105
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,191
Get a place, maybe.

106
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,566
Maybe start a business.
A bar out on the beach.

107
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,366
Something like that.

108
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:04,206
I could quit drinking
and run the place.

109
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,472
Maybe marry a waitress.

110
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,612
What?

111
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,480
You ain't gonna do shit
except go down there

112
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,349
and drink your fucking ass off.

113
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,149
You're gonna piss
everything away

114
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,282
and end up counting the days
till next Christmas.

115
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,927
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

116
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,518
Well, it ain't gonna happen.

117
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,298
If I call you next December...

118
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,526
if I call you next December...

119
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,569
you're gonna be so happy
to hear from me

120
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,866
you're gonna do
a goddamn backflip.

121
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,203
You're gonna put
that Santa hat on so fast

122
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,674
that you're gonna get
fucking hat-burn.

123
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,570
Can I get you guys two more?

124
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,544
No, thanks.
We're all right.

125
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,985
See?

126
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,424
I'm already on the wagon.

127
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,020
Hey. Asshole!

128
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,652
How many times
I got to tell you?

129
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,560
Get out from behind my bar!

130
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,798
Put the drink down right now.

131
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,165
Put the drink down right now!

132
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,897
Ahh.
Fuck you.

133
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,404
- Fuck me, huh?
- Right.

134
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,998
Oh. Hey!

135
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,066
Ow!

136
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,578
Get the fuck out of my bar.

137
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,672
Fuck you!

138
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,775
You're fucking crazy.

139
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,581
Fucking prick.

140
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,515
Asshole!

141
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,955
Get the fuck out of here
right now!

142
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,430
Fucking shit!

143
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,233
Fuck you!

144
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,035
Fuck you!

145
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,837
Fuck you!

146
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,715
Yeah, baby.

147
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,349
Hey, Tiffany, you want to play
"Hide the Nazi" one day?

148
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,327
God damn it.

149
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,835
Here you go, sweetie.

150
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,238
I got something
for your pretty ass.

151
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,433
- You do?
- Yeah.

152
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,644
Wow. $5.

153
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:15,702
Thanks.

154
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,154
I gotta listen to my messages,
and you need to take a shower.

155
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,087
I'm a dancer.
I sweat.

156
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,753
Yeah, well, you smell like
a bum's nut sac.

157
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,853
Fuck you.

158
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:39,361
Message one.

159
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,803
Mr. Soke?

160
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:44,900
This is Andrew Kaplan again,
from the collection agency.

161
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,445
Message two.

162
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,504
This is Dolores Axelrod.

163
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,606
You ran into my car last week.

164
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,083
I called State Farm,

165
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,553
but they have no record
of any insurance policy for you.

166
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,250
In case you misplaced it,
my phone number is 4...

167
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,225
Message three.

168
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,626
Willie, it's Marcus.
It's that time of year again.

169
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,860
Pack your shit.
Phoenix.

170
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,293
Jesus Christ!

171
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,670
Can you maybe keep it together
for just 10 minutes?

172
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,272
Harrison, just let me explain,
please. Financially...

173
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,284
Well, you get what you paid for,
Chipeska.

174
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,047
Five Christmases I've been here.

175
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,214
You flip me for some stranger
who'll do it for peanuts

176
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,814
and who happens to work
with a real midget.

177
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,087
Nobody cares.
Nobody comes here for the elf.

178
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,492
Santa's the attraction.

179
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,029
I do Burl Ives songs.

180
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,860
Does this schmo
even play guitar?

181
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:17,390
Look, Harrison, it's not about
the money or the midget.

182
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,232
Believe me, if it was, I...

183
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,999
I don't think they like
"midget."

184
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,836
I think you're supposed to
call them...

185
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,342
Oh, just forget it.

186
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,374
Hacks!

187
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:29,778
Hi.

188
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,248
Bob Chipeska.
Welcome.

189
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,308
Great photo and résumé,
by the way.

190
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,148
Thanks.

191
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,313
We've been at this
a long time and all.

192
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,152
We'd like to think we do
a good job.

193
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,818
I'm so glad you guys could
come in on such short notice.

194
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,454
I must say,
your look is just sensational.

195
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,189
Thanks.

196
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:48,097
We've been at this for years.
You got nothing to worry about.

197
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,034
You two are the best men
for this job, truly.

198
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,436
So don't let his unpleasantness
affect your performance.

199
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,474
- Oh, no. We're fine.
- Performance?

200
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,443
Yes. Uh, your performance.
You know, the, um...

201
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,706
Performance, like sexual?

202
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,041
- Excuse me?
- Willie.

203
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,448
Are you saying there's
something wrong with my gear?

204
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,815
Is that what you're saying?

205
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,353
- I'm sorry. Your gear?
- Willie.

206
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,218
My fuck stick.

207
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,756
Hey, Willie.
Take a seat.

208
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,294
You know how
your blood sugar is.

209
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,819
He's not going to say "fuck
stick" in front of the children?

210
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,832
No, no, no.
It's a joke.

211
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,233
An adult joke for us adults.

212
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,067
It's a joke.
Just a joke.

213
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,746
"Fuck stick"?

214
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:37,748
Yes. I thought it was
very strange, too.

215
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,307
So, as our security chief,

216
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,512
I wanted you to be aware.

217
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,852
But his little friend promised
he wouldn't say it

218
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,914
in front of the children,
which is fine.

219
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:50,450
Because, you know,
there is an adult world

220
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,997
and a child's world,
and that's okay.

221
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,828
I'm no censor.

222
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,662
"Little friend"?

223
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,669
Yes, he happens to be a dwarf.

224
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,365
Or midget.

225
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,806
I don't know
what he's called exactly.

226
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:07,277
But, uh, he's a little guy.

227
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,213
Little Billy Barty.
God rest.

228
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,408
But thin fingers.

229
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,977
Not the fat sausage fingers.

230
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,957
"Little people."
That's what they like.

231
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:23,517
Yes. Uh, right.
Little people.

232
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,586
So "fuck stick."
That's it?

233
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,397
Yeah.

234
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,202
Merry Christmas!
Santa's coming. Yay!

235
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,438
Merry Christmas!
Santa's coming. Yay!

236
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,002
Merry Christmas!

237
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,451
Have you seen that new Santa
they just hired?

238
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,989
Yeah.
He's back there drunk.

239
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,828
He's coming, guys.
Santa will be here real soon.

240
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,235
God damn it!

241
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,331
What the fuck you doing?
You blow this, and we're broke.

242
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,035
So stop acting
like you know something.

243
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,804
'Cause, pal of mine,
you don't know squat!

244
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,778
Now, put on your hat
and get out there.

245
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,974
And try to act professional,
for Christ's sakes.

246
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,318
What do you want?

247
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,914
What?

248
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,550
Get out of here.

249
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,356
Next.

250
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,027
Next.

251
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,532
Oh, good.
What do you want?

252
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,802
What do you want?
What are you doing?

253
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:41,995
God damn it!

254
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,235
Nintendo Deer Hunter 3.

255
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,277
I don't give a shit
what you want.

256
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,007
Blowing snot all over everybody
and fucking whatever.

257
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,106
Next.
Come on.

258
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,609
What do you want?

259
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,950
- Um, Santa?
- Yeah, I'm Santa.

260
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,216
Come on.
What do you want?

261
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,451
- Um, Barbie.
- Say cheese.

262
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,719
Okay. Fine.
Barbie.

263
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,055
Oh, thank you.

264
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:06,097
Ow! Watch the toenails, kid!
Shit.

265
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,461
Next.

266
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,501
Next!

267
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,030
What do you want?

268
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,631
Fraggle-Stick car.

269
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,699
What the fuck is that?

270
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,335
Fraggle-Stick car.

271
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:23,381
Well, I heard you.
Fraggle-Stick car. Fine.

272
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,256
Hey, check out this loser.

273
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,198
Hey, fat-ass.
How you doing today?

274
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,862
Hey, loser.

275
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,769
Hey, dipshit.

276
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,398
Moron.

277
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,342
Hey, loser.
How you doing today?

278
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,478
Dumb-ass,
why don't you turn around?

279
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,086
You know what?
Fuck this.

280
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,350
You're next.

281
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,418
Next.

282
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,862
I said next, God damn it.
This is not the DMV, all right?

283
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,627
Move it along.

284
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,069
What's your name?
You can tell me.

285
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,438
I know.
How about Santa?

286
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,069
If you don't tell him,
you won't get a present.

287
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,204
That's right.

288
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,250
Come on and tell Santa
all about it.

289
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:36,876
What do you want?

290
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,716
Well, come on.
What do you want?

291
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,657
A snot-rag?

292
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,825
Great.
Another fucking Mongoloid.

293
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:51,232
Marcus, get this kid off me
before he pisses on me.

294
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,964
Don't fuck with my beard.

295
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,505
It's not real.

296
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,063
No shit.

297
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,369
Well, it was real.

298
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:00,775
But, you see, I got sick
and all the hair fell out.

299
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,780
How did you get sick?

300
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,316
I loved a woman
who wasn't clean.

301
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,476
Mrs. Santa?

302
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,779
No.
It was her sister.

303
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,980
What's it like
at the North Pole?

304
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,420
Like the suburbs.

305
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,980
Which one?

306
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,189
Apache Junction.

307
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,024
What the fuck do you care?
Now, get off my lap.

308
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,087
You sit there
like a fucking retard.

309
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,133
You are really Santa, right?

310
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,531
No.
I'm an accountant.

311
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:27,060
I wear this fucking thing as
a fashion statement, all right?

312
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,868
Okay.

313
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,465
Get this kid out of here.
He's freaking me out.

314
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,582
I got to get a drink on.
I'll see you tomorrow.

315
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,348
Just don't come into work
stinking of booze again.

316
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,889
Yeah.
Why don't you get going?

317
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:47,948
You'll be late for your
"Wizard of Oz" Candy Bar Guild.

318
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,426
Lollipop Guild, you asshole.
Jesus!

319
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,895
Two-year-olds flip me shit
better than you.

320
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:54,056
You saying something to me?

321
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:57,465
Yeah. I'm gonna stick
my whole fist up your ass.

322
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,173
What?

323
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,782
Mmm.

324
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,911
Another Grand-Dad, Santa?

325
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:49,919
Yeah.

326
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,080
Yeah?

327
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,822
Got a name?

328
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,528
Yeah.

329
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,133
So, what do you do, you know...

330
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,638
After the holidays, I mean.

331
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,642
Well, nothing till March,
and then I'm the Easter Bunny.

332
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,641
Oh. Another?

333
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,149
Yeah. Why not?

334
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,287
Merry Christmas.

335
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,419
Not a big talker.

336
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,053
No, not really.

337
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,460
- Buy you one?
- Why not?

338
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,901
Happy New Year.

339
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,536
You're pretty regular
for a Santa.

340
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,275
It's not that big
a fucking deal.

341
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,544
It's just a job,
you know what I mean?

342
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:57,987
I'm an eating, drinking,
shitting, fucking Santy Claus.

343
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,056
Prove it.

344
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,291
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.

345
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:08,491
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.

346
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,125
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa!

347
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,566
Can't I at least take
this hat off?

348
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:13,331
No. I love the hat.

349
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,202
Okay.

350
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:18,436
Whoo!

351
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:26,779
I've always had a thing
for Santa Claus.

352
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,478
In case you didn't notice.

353
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,545
It's like some deep-seated
childhood thing.

354
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,557
So is my thing for tits.

355
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,889
Yeah.
It is like that, though.

356
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,155
From when you're a kid.

357
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,560
'Cause my dad was Jewish,
and we didn't have Christmas.

358
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:44,125
So it was like
this forbidden thing.

359
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:48,866
So...

360
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:52,873
I like you.

361
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,278
Don't mothball that suit.

362
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:04,954
What the fuck?

363
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,014
I am not gay.

364
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,018
- What the hell, buddy?
- Buddy?

365
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,995
I said I am not gay.

366
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:15,191
Are you off your fucking meds
or something?

367
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,733
Yes.

368
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,463
But that isn't
what this is about.

369
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,232
You're as queer as a $ 10 bill.

370
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,638
Let me tell you something,
motherfucker.

371
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:27,405
My brother lost a goddamn arm
fighting you fuckers in Vietnam.

372
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,676
So I want you to look at my face
one last fucking time.

373
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,377
This is the last thing you're
ever gonna see before I...

374
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:34,418
Elf fucker!

375
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,579
- Motherfucker!
- Turn around, elf fucker.

376
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,123
Who's the bitch now,
Santy Claus? Huh?

377
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,919
Faggy Claus!
Faggy!

378
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,254
Leave Santa alone!

379
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,626
Little boy, don't interfere.
I am doing this for all of us.

380
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:47,460
Leave Santa alone!

381
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,935
Ass clown.

382
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,980
Hey, you're that kid.

383
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,775
What the fuck are you
doing here?

384
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,162
This one fucking time
I take you home, okay?

385
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,222
Uh-huh.

386
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,734
I'm not your fucking dada.

387
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,498
Uh-huh.

388
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:31,108
It's not like you helped me
with that nutjob or anything.

389
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:32,837
- Uh-huh.
- You're the right height.

390
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,505
You're right there
to grab his balls.

391
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,775
- You could twist them.
- Why do you need a car?

392
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,909
- What?
- This car.

393
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:41,917
Which turn is it?

394
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,079
Sage Terrace.
Where's your sleigh?

395
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,316
It's in the shop,
getting repaired.

396
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,825
- Where are the reindeer?
- I stabled them.

397
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,155
Is it left or right?

398
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,252
That way.

399
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,956
Where's the stable?

400
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,192
- Next to the shop.
- How do they sleep?

401
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,359
Who? The reindeer?
Standing up.

402
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:58,902
But the noise.
How do they sleep?

403
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,961
- What noise?
- From the shop.

404
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,500
They only work during the day,
all right?

405
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,339
I thought it was always night
at the North Pole.

406
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,345
Well, not now.
Right now it's always day.

407
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,607
Then how do they sleep?

408
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,979
- Oh, shit. Sage Terrace.

409
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,508
What is it with you? Somebody
drop you on your fucking head?

410
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,986
On my head?

411
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,319
Are they gonna drop you
on somebody else's head?

412
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,051
How can they drop me
onto my own head?

413
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,890
No, not onto your...
Would...

414
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:27,022
God damn it!
Are you fucking with me?

415
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,003
Okay.
Which house is it?

416
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,333
That one.

417
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,270
With Jesus and his family
there or what?

418
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,899
No.
The one beside that.

419
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,807
- Right here?
- Yeah. That one.

420
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,368
All right.

421
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,522
Nice digs.

422
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,257
Is Daddy home?

423
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,293
He's on an adventure,
exploring mountains.

424
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,794
He's been gone a long time.

425
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:01,593
Exploring mountains, huh?
How long is he gonna be gone?

426
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,598
Till next year.

427
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:03,964
Yeah?
What about Mommy?

428
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:07,129
She lives in God's house with
Jesus and Mary and the ghost

429
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:10,697
and the long-eared donkey and
Joseph and the talking walnut.

430
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,239
Well, who the fuck takes care
of you, then?

431
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,107
Grandma.

432
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,771
Yeah?
What's her name?

433
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,178
Grandma.

434
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,249
Is Granny spry?

435
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:25,411
Everybody!

436
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:32,219
Grandma? Grandma?

437
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,527
Santa's here.

438
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,727
Oh, Roger.
You're home.

439
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,066
Are you spry?

440
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:43,403
Let me fix you some sandwiches.

441
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:54,307
Are you telling me
she's the only one here?

442
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:55,750
Nobody else?

443
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,914
No aunts or cousins or uncles
or anything like that?

444
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,958
A butler or security guard
or something?

445
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,357
Nuh-unh.

446
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,362
You're shitting me.

447
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,625
Does your daddy have a safe?

448
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,438
Need money to fix your sleigh?

449
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,442
Exactly.

450
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,180
You want milk and cookies?

451
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,309
No.

452
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,909
Should I fix you
some sandwiches?

453
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,284
Unh-unh.

454
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,822
Does your daddy have a car?

455
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,994
Bye, Santa!

456
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,304
Oh, my!

457
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,313
- Keep going.
- Jesus!

458
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,679
Ohh!

459
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,852
Oh, God!

460
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,853
Ooh!

461
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,686
Oh, Zena!
Oh, Mary!

462
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,816
Keep it going.

463
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,621
Jesus Christ!

464
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,389
Yeah, baby.
Yeah, baby.

465
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,987
You ain't gonna
shit right for a week.

466
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:14,997
Oh!

467
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,499
- Yeah, buddy!
- Yeah!

468
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,899
- Whoo!

469
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,534
It won't happen again.
I can promise you that.

470
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,840
Willie here has low blood sugar.
That's all.

471
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,107
That's right.
I forgot to take my pill.

472
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,580
It's not just the swearing.

473
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,175
Um...

474
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:38,187
Forgive me for prying.

475
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,851
But did one of you, um...

476
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,018
fornicate...

477
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,061
Fornicate?

478
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,825
Yes, with a heavyset woman
in the Big & Tall dressing room.

479
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,367
Look, I've boned a lot
of fat chicks in my time, sure.

480
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:55,566
But as far as I can recall,
I've never fornicated anybody.

481
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,834
Yes, well, even still,

482
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,843
I think it's best for
all parties considered if we...

483
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,572
If we what?

484
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,240
Well, I have someone else
interested in the position.

485
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,708
Before you do something stupid,

486
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,343
you may want to think
about this shit.

487
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,580
What are you talking about?

488
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,249
I'm talking about firing
a little black midget.

489
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,884
A colored, African-American
small person.

490
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,188
That's what I'm talking about.

491
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:21,357
I'm talking about your face
all over goddamn "USA Today."

492
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,832
I'm talking about 150
of these little motherfuckers

493
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:26,028
all over the sidewalk out there.

494
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,004
Little picket signs,
chanting and raving.

495
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,438
Using little bullhorns
and shit like that.

496
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,102
Screaming and hollering
your name out.

497
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,372
Unfair practices.
Get me?

498
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,744
No. No, no.
This is not a handicap thing.

499
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,079
I have nothing
against you people.

500
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:42,984
"You people"?

501
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,852
Did you hear that, Marcus?
He said, "You people."

502
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:47,220
Who the hell is "us people"?

503
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,553
Wait. Wait.
No, no.

504
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,856
I... You don't under...
What?

505
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,919
He...
No, no.

506
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:55,932
Um, you know, I think it's best

507
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,867
if we just forget we had
this conversation.

508
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,332
Okay.

509
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:03,669
Good thinking.

510
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,232
And don't worry about us.
We'll be fine.

511
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,744
Let's get the hell
out of here, Marcus.

512
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,046
You're pathetic.

513
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,089
I dig that little thing
on your belly button.

514
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,428
What's that?
Like a diamond?

515
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,468
It's a belly-button ring.

516
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,935
Oh, yeah?
Hang on a second.

517
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,665
Check this out.

518
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,469
You got to thrust.
See what I'm saying?

519
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,140
You gotta move the ball around.
You go up there, baby.

520
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,543
Come on.

521
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:44,877
See? Move the ball.
There you go.

522
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:47,179
Motherfucker!

523
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,448
Oh, you lousy, fucking
motherfucker.

524
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,792
That's the shit
that's gonna get us pinched.

525
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,191
She said she was 18.

526
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,660
But you promised no arcades.

527
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,458
You said you'd only hustle
Big & Tall.

528
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,329
You shat me out of your womb?
You're my fucking mom now?

529
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,062
I don't need
any goddamn lectures.

530
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,604
I know how to keep
a low profile. Thank you.

531
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,536
What the fuck is this,
Mr. Low Profile?

532
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,873
Mind your own goddamn business.

533
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,520
Ever hear of
the open bottle law?

534
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:30,786
A couple of days ago, I was in,
uh, Women's Big & Tall.

535
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,921
And I heard these...

536
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:37,093
Um, you know, these noises.

537
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:41,696
And I heard a woman screaming,
"Yeah. Oh, yeah."

538
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:45,105
And I heard his voice saying,
"That's right.

539
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:51,172
You ain't going to S-H-l-T
right for a month."

540
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,950
But don't get me wrong.

541
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:57,112
I was against
the Clinton impeachment.

542
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,179
What a man does
with his own penis...

543
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,350
Oval Office,
Women's Big & Tall...

544
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:04,121
it's not for
the American people to say.

545
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:04,923
Yeah, right.

546
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,523
But when you're dealing
with children...

547
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,203
They have a tender sensibility.

548
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,137
And you are in a position
of trust.

549
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:21,770
I think perhaps someone who has
screaming orgasms

550
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,474
with large women shouldn't...

551
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,039
Yeah.

552
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,080
Of course,
I can't fire him for that.

553
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,383
Oh, yeah.
Unfair practices.

554
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:34,015
Special pleading.
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

555
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,456
Fucking broads.

556
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,788
But I just can't help it.

557
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,319
There's something about the guy
that makes me uneasy.

558
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,365
Well, sure.

559
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:44,128
Santa fucking someone
in the ass.

560
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,363
- So...

561
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,999
Maybe there's something
I could fire him for.

562
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,242
Yeah, I get you.

563
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,972
Do you?

564
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,911
Do you think
you could find something?

565
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,950
Shit, yeah.
There's always something.

566
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,198
Shit.

567
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,879
Hey, Opal.
Come here.

568
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,141
Unh-unh.

569
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,046
Screw you, Willie,
your kinky ass.

570
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:34,982
Last time I didn't shit right
for a week.

571
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:38,078
No, it's not that.
I need to talk to you.

572
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:41,124
I'm just tired of you, Willie.

573
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,185
Ooh.

574
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,497
Who the fuck is in my room?

575
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,032
Did you see somebody
go in my room?

576
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,227
Yeah.
Some guy asking about you.

577
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,462
Looked like a cop.

578
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,128
Oh, shit.

579
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,565
Marcus, it's Willie.

580
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,734
I just got back to the motel.

581
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,141
Some guy is nosing around
in my room.

582
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,839
What guy?
You get a look at him?

583
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,540
No.
But I think he's a cop, though.

584
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,741
Think somebody's onto us?

585
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,080
Is there anything in the room?
Anything professional?

586
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,585
No, I just got clothes in there.

587
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:10,985
Just ditch, you idiot.

588
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,148
You got anywhere to sack out
for a while?

589
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:15,921
- Santa!
- Yeah.

590
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,585
You're bringing
my present early?

591
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:18,993
No.

592
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,730
But I never told you
what I wanted.

593
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,632
I said I didn't bring it,
dipshit.

594
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,169
Okay. Good.

595
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:29,263
I want a stuffed elephant.
A pink one.

596
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,331
Wish in one hand,
shit in the other one.

597
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,242
See which one fills up first.

598
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,745
Okay.

599
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,008
So I'm gonna be staying here
for a while.

600
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,107
Things are all fucked up
at the North Pole.

601
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,209
Mrs. Santa caught me
fucking her sister.

602
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,119
And I'm out on my ass now.

603
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,054
She got half of everything.

604
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:49,115
This is gonna be cool.

605
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,024
This will do fine.

606
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,159
So I'm gonna be crashing here.

607
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:02,433
It will be just you and me,
like roommates, you know?

608
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,667
Do you and Mrs. Santa have kids?

609
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,369
No.
Thank the fuck Christ.

610
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,412
What about the elves?

611
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,440
Well, they stay with Mrs. Santa.

612
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,745
I get them on the weekends.

613
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,013
Why don't you go run me a bath?

614
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,256
What about the reindeer?

615
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,885
Would you please shut up
about reindeer?

616
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,896
What are their names?

617
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:27,953
Who?

618
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,090
The elves.

619
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,531
Oh, shit.
I can't remember.

620
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,967
I think one of them is Sneezy.
There's a Dopey.

621
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,937
That's the Seven Dwarfs.

622
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,734
Oh, you're shitting me.

623
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,901
I thought...
I was thinking it was the...

624
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,239
I don't know.
Fuck, kid.

625
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,405
I just call them, "bub."

626
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,540
I say, "Hey, bub" or "chief"
or whatever the fuck.

627
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,379
I tell him to make
the goddamn toy.

628
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,419
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

629
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,250
I can't remember this shit!

630
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,348
Does everything with you
have to be a fucking test?

631
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,360
How old are they?

632
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,426
You want cookies?

633
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,326
No.

634
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,633
Warm milk?

635
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:09,604
No.

636
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,368
Should I fix you
some sandwiches?

637
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,205
I don't want
any fucking sandwiches.

638
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,768
What is it with you
and fixing fucking sandwiches?

639
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:18,144
Okay.
Do you want anything else?

640
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,842
No.

641
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,386
Okay.

642
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,727
Santa?

643
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,097
What?

644
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,731
I brought you some orange juice.

645
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,902
What's in it?

646
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,569
Oranges.

647
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:53,179
Look what I have.

648
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,309
An Advent calendar.

649
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,512
What the hell is that?

650
00:40:56,587 --> 00:41:00,353
It's the story of Christmas,
but in a calendar.

651
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:02,449
Every day you peel open
a new box.

652
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,118
You get part of the story.

653
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,186
And then there's
a chocolate inside.

654
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,891
Do you want to open up
today's box and read it?

655
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,801
No.
You go ahead.

656
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:17,172
Jesus Christ, kid.
Watch the nuts.

657
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:28,377
"So Joseph went up from
the town of Nazareth in Galilee

658
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:31,444
to Judea, to Bethlehem,
the town of David.

659
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:34,457
In those days Caesar Augustus
issued a decree

660
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:37,551
that a census should be taken
of the entire Roman world.

661
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:40,791
Everyone went to his hometown
to register."

662
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:45,595
- That it?
- Yep.

663
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,001
That's an awesome
fucking story, kid.

664
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:51,530
There's more to it, but we
have to wait till tomorrow.

665
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,173
Do you want to eat
the chocolate?

666
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:57,305
You go ahead.

667
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,782
Are you coming downstairs?

668
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,515
I'll be down in a minute.
I got to go to work.

669
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,196
Fuck me?
Fuck you.

670
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,260
You can't just take up
with some kid.

671
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,703
You don't know who's around
or what they do.

672
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,207
You got some nerve,
you little shit, you.

673
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:27,938
What, you're my mom now?
You shat me out of your womb?

674
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:31,448
You said that yesterday,
you stupid fuck.

675
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,142
Shit.

676
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,884
Fuck you.

677
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:46,960
You are by far the dumbest,

678
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:49,659
most pathetic piece
of maggot-eating shit

679
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:53,169
that has ever slid
from a human being's hairy ass.

680
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,768
What if the kid has one of those
fucking playdates they have now?

681
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,570
Are you shitting me?
The kid don't have any friends.

682
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:02,771
He don't even have an imaginary
friend unless he ditched him.

683
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,815
He lives with his drooling-ass
old grandmother.

684
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,578
Sits in front of the TV
all the time.

685
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:09,050
You think she's gonna
rat me out?

686
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,054
She don't know her ass
from last Tuesday.

687
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,055
You fuck her?

688
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:16,819
Jesus Christ.

689
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,794
Is everything fucking sex
with you?

690
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,921
With me?
I fuck one person.

691
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:22,522
I ain't out there
serial fornicating,

692
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,727
trying to float my liver,
drinking myself silly

693
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:27,828
'cause I can't stand
what a piece of shit I am.

694
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,635
What are you,
Sigmund Sawed-off Fucking Freud?

695
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,335
Yeah, that's right.

696
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:33,967
Go ahead.
Talk about my height.

697
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:35,671
Make it about something safe

698
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,611
'cause you're
an emotional cripple.

699
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,239
Your soul is dog shit.

700
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:41,807
Every single fucking thing
about you is ugly.

701
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,084
Come on, Lois.
Let's get out of here.

702
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:04,566
Look who's here, Jimmy.
It's Santa.

703
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,166
That's fucking great.

704
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:08,803
Let's tell him what you want
for Christmas.

705
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:10,940
Fuck.

706
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:17,614
I'm on my fucking
lunch break, okay?

707
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,713
Are you insane?

708
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,587
Management's gonna hear
about this.

709
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,093
You think that's a threat?

710
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,324
If you think you can make my
life any worse, go right ahead.

711
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:30,162
Be my fucking guest.
Take a shot.

712
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,990
Just looking.

713
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,795
Aah!

714
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:12,067
Find everything
you're looking for?

715
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,372
Um, yeah.
Thank you.

716
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,312
Nothing I can help
you with, huh?

717
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:21,317
No. I'm just looking at
the games 'cause I have an Xbox.

718
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,218
Get your hands
out of my pants, man!

719
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:27,655
You're stealing from the store,
you're stealing from me.

720
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,056
What is this?

721
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:31,060
I was gonna pay for it.

722
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,186
Wrong answer.

723
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,162
When I look at you,
you know what I think?

724
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,029
I think America has
a sad future ahead of it.

725
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:39,626
And you're part
of this sorry-ass generation.

726
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,295
What you want to be
when you grow up?

727
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,669
I don't know.

728
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,902
- This MP3?
- Yeah.

729
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:47,341
Take it off.

730
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,971
But my grandmother gave...

731
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:52,481
Take it off. I don't care
who gave it to you.

732
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:54,517
Take it off.

733
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,485
I don't care if it choke you
to death.

734
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:58,646
Now, I want you to get on
out of here. Get!

735
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:00,349
- But can I have...
- Get!

736
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,584
Happy Kwanzaa.

737
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,097
And pull your damn pants up!

738
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:09,029
What's wrong with you kids
these days?

739
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,562
Gin?

740
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:13,364
- Yeah.
- What do you need?

741
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,166
I need you to run a plate
for me.

742
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,365
It's Arizona plates.

743
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,237
Hold on.
Let me get a pen.

744
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,602
Is that it?

745
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:01,350
For Christ's sake, make a move
and stick with it, would you?

746
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,120
King me.

747
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,395
Son of a bitch!

748
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:20,095
You lousy, cheating little shit!

749
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:24,499
You're fucking with me!
You did that on purpose.

750
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:27,135
You play like the dead lice
are falling off of you,

751
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:30,044
and then suddenly, you're like
Seabiscuit all over the place.

752
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,604
You're a smartass,
is what you are, kid.

753
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,413
Want to play again?

754
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:41,715
Howdy.
Herb Gunner.

755
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:44,158
I live two streets over
on Burning Trail Road.

756
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:45,957
I don't think we've met.

757
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,060
I'm Uncle Willie.

758
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:52,897
I'm organizing the decorations
for the subdivision this year.

759
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,404
- You mind if I come in?
- Yeah.

760
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,872
I mean yeah, I mind.

761
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,135
Okay. Uh...

762
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:03,168
Will you be participating in our
luminarias program this year?

763
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:08,048
- What the hell is a lunamaria?
- They're luminarias.

764
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:10,552
Small sacks filled with
about a pound of sand each.

765
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:12,589
We insert a candle
in the middle, light it,

766
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:13,987
and the bag glows.

767
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,718
Then we line
all the sidewalks here

768
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:18,158
all around the neighborhood.

769
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:22,698
You see, we don't celebrate
Christmas around here, so...

770
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,997
We're, uh, we're Muslims.

771
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,128
Look, it's my first year
running this.

772
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,503
I'd like it if there weren't
any gaps in it.

773
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,304
What if I come by
Christmas Eve and do it for you?

774
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:35,470
No, you know what?
You don't have to do that.

775
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:38,139
Yeah, me and the kid here,
we'll do something.

776
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:39,477
Great.
I got the supplies.

777
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:41,016
- I'll throw them in the garage.
- Perfect.

778
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,984
Awesome.

779
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,748
Going in the garage,
just so you know.

780
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:48,450
You can make
a delicious six-pound chicken.

781
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,653
Enough hot dogs and sausages
to feed a small army.

782
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:54,959
Not one, but two delicious
rotisserie chickens.

783
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:57,500
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa.

784
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:00,434
Fuck me, Santa.
Fuck me, Santa. Fuck me, Santa.

785
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:03,496
Scrumptious
61/2-pound standing rib roast.

786
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:08,237
And everybody's favorite,
baby back ribs.

787
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:24,722
This is such a nice house.

788
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,320
Needs a woman's touch, though.

789
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:30,389
I just rent
the fucking place anyway.

790
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,828
Yeah.
I just rent stuff, too.

791
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:36,065
Yeah?

792
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,674
How long are you gonna be here?

793
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,808
What? On the couch?

794
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,511
No.

795
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,315
In town.

796
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:55,551
I don't know.
Just through the holidays.

797
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,923
You know, then I'll move on.

798
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:01,764
So, do you like kids?

799
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,763
Fuck, no!

800
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,303
Do you think
I'm some kind of pervert?

801
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:10,272
I just mean because
you're Santa Claus.

802
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,275
Oh.

803
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,606
I like kids.
I really like kids.

804
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,839
- You do?
- I love kids.

805
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:18,574
Well, good.

806
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,910
Yeah, they're something else,
those kids.

807
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,955
And to tell you the truth...

808
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:32,653
The fact of the matter is,
I'm not Santa.

809
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:37,923
Like ya anyway.

810
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,714
So, you'll call me, right?

811
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,549
Yeah.
I'll call you.

812
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:58,952
I'm gonna buy you some flowers.

813
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:01,456
Some of those
really good expensive ones.

814
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:02,787
Shut up.

815
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,996
Bye.

816
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:16,054
Roger, you're home.

817
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,829
Let me fix you some sandwiches.

818
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:22,093
What the fuck?

819
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:25,573
Kid, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

820
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:32,013
Jesus Christ!

821
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:33,549
Let me see it!
Let me see it!

822
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:34,914
What the hell happened to you?!

823
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:38,216
I cut my hand by mistake!
Ow!

824
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,848
- Of course it was by mistake.
- Ow!

825
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:42,915
Here, hold still.
Hold still.

826
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:46,656
I was just trying to help you!

827
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,597
I forgot to say,
"It's gonna sting a little bit."

828
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,157
Shouldn't I wrap it
in a T-shirt or something?

829
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:53,930
God damn it.

830
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:01,309
- Hey, kid?

831
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:05,039
Kid, you okay up there?

832
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:07,640
You need a Band-Aid
or something?

833
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,986
Aw, shit.

834
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:28,998
You're late.

835
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:37,571
Kids.
Let me tell you.

836
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:42,915
They run you ragged.

837
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:56,793
Morning, team.

838
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,426
Hey, hey, hey.

839
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:00,765
It's not quite 8:00 yet.

840
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:03,796
Well, how close are we?

841
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:09,642
Now it's 8:00.

842
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:10,805
Merry Christmas.

843
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,848
Up your ass.

844
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:20,554
God damn it!

845
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:22,182
You tear your ball again?

846
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,521
I don't think so.

847
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:26,187
That's it.

848
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:44,839
God damn it!

849
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,921
Sweetheart,
don't romance 'em, now.

850
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:03,659
Go on and get in there.
I can take it.

851
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,201
Yeah.

852
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,261
Gin, I got the info
on that Arizona plate.

853
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,307
All right.
Now you're talking.

854
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:13,399
Oh, hold on one minute.

855
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,876
Baby, baby. Baby, baby.
Don't use that one.

856
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:17,003
That's not the stuff.

857
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,378
Use something
with some claws to it.

858
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:21,849
Yeah, that hard candy.
That's it right there.

859
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:25,183
Let me get some of that.
Yeah, that's it.

860
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:26,586
Okay.

861
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:27,588
Yeah, I'm back.

862
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,090
The guy's Roger Merman.

863
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,389
- Guess where he is.
- Give it to me.

864
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:34,555
Ow! Damn it!
What's wrong with you, woman?

865
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:45,565
Who are you?

866
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:46,870
Your name Roger Merman?

867
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,932
Yes. But...

868
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,740
You doing three to six
for embezzlement?

869
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:54,409
Uh, well, many accounting
questions are not cut-and-dried.

870
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:56,918
Do you live at 41 Sage Terrace?

871
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:58,954
Is it Grandma?

872
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,216
Is my son all right?

873
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,621
They're fine.

874
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,989
Do you have any houseguests?

875
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:05,820
Houseguests?

876
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:10,222
Thank you for your time.
God bless.

877
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,959
Well, hey, who are you?

878
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:17,433
Houseguests?

879
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:23,070
Little trick I learned
up at the North Pole.

880
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:25,910
If you fry baloney,
it tastes like a hot dog.

881
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,882
I thought you
didn't like sandwiches.

882
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:29,885
Yeah, but this
is not a sandwich.

883
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:31,511
A sandwich has
two pieces of bread

884
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,419
with a bunch of junk on it.

885
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,181
It's like a tostada.

886
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:38,853
This isn't a tostada.

887
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,259
There you go, Granny.

888
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:43,596
Little salsa here.

889
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:47,067
Now it's a tostada.

890
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,433
Have you seen
my Advent calendar?

891
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:51,906
What the fuck is it
with the Advent calendar?

892
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:54,136
Why are you so obsessed
with that goddamn thing?

893
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,201
The story sucks anyway.

894
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:01,841
I think I saw it in the hallway.

895
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,647
- Really?
- I think so.

896
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,193
Looks like someone messed
with my Advent calendar.

897
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,825
What are you talking about?
Let me see.

898
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:21,434
Nobody messed with it.
It looks fine.

899
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:38,849
There's a candy corn
in this one.

900
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,550
Well, they can't all be winners,
can they?

901
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:49,465
Well, it's fucked.

902
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:50,931
Yeah?

903
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,627
Yeah.

904
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:54,397
- Fucked, frankly.
- He's...

905
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,063
- Clean...
- Oh.

906
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,834
- As a fucking whistle.
- Nothing?

907
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:59,204
- No.
- Oh.

908
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:01,209
- Nothing. I mean shit.
- Yeah.

909
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:02,539
- He curses.
- Yeah?

910
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:04,409
- But never around children.
- Oh.

911
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,914
- No criminal record.
- Yeah.

912
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,576
- No parking tickets.
- Nothing.

913
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,744
- No bad habits, even.
- Oh.

914
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,117
Sex, yeah.

915
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:14,850
- But man is a sexual being.
- Yeah.

916
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,721
- Fuckin' Darwinian.
- Oh.

917
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:18,852
- You can't do shit about that.
- No.

918
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,623
Hell, I wouldn't want to.

919
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:27,092
No, of course not.
I'm not advocating celibacy.

920
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,934
Hope not. It'd be the end
of the fucking human race.

921
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,769
Yeah.

922
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,502
Fucks large women.

923
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:36,038
What can I say?

924
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:51,549
Hey, look,
it's the retard again.

925
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:03,372
Wedgie.

926
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:05,100
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

927
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:08,944
Well, what the hell do you want?

928
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:10,411
Pokémon!

929
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,845
Done.

930
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,450
You probably shouldn't
be digging in your ass.

931
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,521
Santa...

932
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,890
Oh, jeez.

933
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,632
- Is that your underwear?
- Part of it.

934
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,498
Where the hell's the rest of it?

935
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,038
No, actually, don't tell me.
What do you want?

936
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:39,666
I was thinking I wanted a purple
stuffed elephant, not pink.

937
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,437
But now I changed my mind.

938
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:44,446
- Yeah, what?
- Now I don't want an elephant.

939
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:46,072
I want a gorilla named Davey

940
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:49,016
for beating up the skateboard
kids who pull on my underwear.

941
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,451
He could take his orders
from the talking walnut,

942
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,955
so it wouldn't be my bad thing.

943
00:59:58,561 --> 00:59:59,789
Jesus, kid.

944
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:02,126
When I was your age,
I didn't need no gorilla,

945
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:04,166
and I wasn't as big
as one of your legs.

946
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:06,633
Four kids beat me up
and I went crying to my daddy.

947
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:08,568
- You know what he did?
- He made it all better?

948
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:11,402
No, he kicked my ass.
You know why?

949
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:14,375
'Cause you went to the bathroom
on Mommy's dishes?

950
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,036
What the fuck?

951
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:16,976
No.

952
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:19,708
He tried to teach you
not to cry and be a man?

953
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:23,946
No. It's because he was
a mean, drunk son of a bitch.

954
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,681
When he wasn't busting my ass,

955
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:27,586
he was putting cigarettes out
on my neck.

956
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:28,988
The world ain't fair.

957
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:31,458
You gotta take what you need
when you can get it.

958
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:34,223
Learn to stand up for yourself.
Quit being a pussy.

959
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:36,959
Kick these kids
in the balls or something.

960
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,159
Or don't.
Shit, I don't care.

961
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:42,727
Just leave me out of it.
Now, get on out of here.

962
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,330
Okay.
Thanks, Santa.

963
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:02,257
Go get the next lucky boy
or girl, okay?

964
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,356
All right, next.

965
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:09,528
Open the ropes there, Marcus.

966
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:11,760
I know you?

967
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:12,858
Not yet.

968
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:17,335
Seven cities in seven years.

969
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:19,068
Pretty impressive.

970
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:21,440
The store changes,
your name changes.

971
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,979
But you always get away clean.

972
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,309
Yeah.

973
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:27,281
Pretty darn impressive.

974
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,942
Well, let's face the facts.

975
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,248
Y'all are a couple
of half-bucket small-timers.

976
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,551
You, because of your physical
attributes, found a niche,

977
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:36,148
and I respect that.

978
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:38,250
But you also been caught...

979
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,488
...by me.

980
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:43,396
So this is how it's gonna be.

981
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,093
I don't want to take over.

982
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:47,432
I don't even want to change
your scam.

983
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:49,596
Whatever you guys do, it works.

984
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:51,572
All I want is a taste.

985
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:54,166
When the deed is done,
we part ways.

986
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:56,074
I'll buy a little ranch
in Havasu,

987
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:59,512
and you all take your little
medicine show back on the road.

988
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:03,448
- How much?
- Half.

989
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,817
No way! You don't know
who you're fucking with.

990
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:09,051
Back off, Will.
I got this. I got this!

991
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,325
Okay. 30%.

992
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,193
There's three of us.
30%. That's fair.

993
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:16,959
Half.

994
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:18,330
I meant 33%...

995
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,265
I meant half.

996
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:20,359
...and 1/3.

997
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:21,926
Half.

998
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,433
35%.

999
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:26,102
Half.

1000
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:27,836
40%.

1001
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:30,444
Half.

1002
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:33,847
42%.

1003
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,383
Half.

1004
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:43,518
45%.

1005
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:51,157
Half.

1006
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:53,257
48%?

1007
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,496
Half.

1008
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,264
49%.

1009
01:02:58,341 --> 01:02:59,774
Half.

1010
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,309
Well, what's one point?

1011
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:05,313
We split the dough
right down the middle.

1012
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:07,849
Any merchandise you take, I get
to look at and cherry-pick.

1013
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:10,249
No! Money's one thing,
but you ain't gettin' the...

1014
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,753
This ain't no Chinese menu,
jagoff.

1015
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:15,382
I tell you how it's gonna be.

1016
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,824
This is pricks fix.

1017
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,357
Pricks fix?

1018
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:26,367
He's a fucking moron.

1019
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:27,333
Oh, really?

1020
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:29,200
Is that how you got
the upper hand?

1021
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:30,170
Fuck you.

1022
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:31,228
Negotiating?

1023
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:33,172
If you don't like,
next year, fuck off.

1024
01:03:33,242 --> 01:03:35,005
I can always get
another box jockey.

1025
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:36,442
I can get another midget, too.

1026
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:37,740
Yeah, where?

1027
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,840
You see us hanging off of trees
like fucking crab apples?

1028
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:43,351
Even if we did, you'd never
front your own racket.

1029
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:45,751
You know why, Willie?
You got no discipline.

1030
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:49,155
You got zero fuckin' initiative.
You'd fall apart without me.

1031
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:50,852
You're too pathetic for words.

1032
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:53,691
You're a fucking loser,
and you fucking know it.

1033
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:20,086
Santa'll be here real soon,
kids. Real soon.

1034
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:25,356
There he is.
Look.

1035
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:30,322
Oh, no.

1036
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,939
Oh, my God!

1037
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,628
Sweet Jews for Jesus.

1038
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:11,730
I pissed myself.

1039
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:13,502
What the fuck
do you think you doing?

1040
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,407
You son of a bitch!

1041
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:16,638
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

1042
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:18,077
Hey, come on, come on.

1043
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:19,774
Look, hey!
Come on, come on!

1044
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,783
Look here.
Get him out of here.

1045
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:23,478
I'll smooth things over
with Chipeska.

1046
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:26,316
- Tell him food poisoning.
- "Get him out of here"?

1047
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:27,720
Take him to the car.

1048
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:30,782
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm a motherfuckin' dwarf.

1049
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,851
So unless you got
a forklift handy,

1050
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,863
maybe you should
lend a hand, hmm?

1051
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,990
That figures. You want
all kind of set-asides.

1052
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,931
Special treatment
'cause you're handicapped.

1053
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:39,899
You all the same.

1054
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,061
Special treatment?

1055
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:43,469
I'm 3-foot-fucking-tall,
you asshole!

1056
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:45,131
It's a matter of physics.

1057
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:47,675
Draw me a sketch of how
I get him to the car, huh?

1058
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:49,506
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

1059
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,205
Sketch it up, you moron.

1060
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,840
Fucking Leonardo da Vinci.

1061
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,584
What you call me, thigh high?

1062
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:58,313
I called you
a fucking guinea homo

1063
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:00,719
from the 15th-fucking-century,
you dickhead!

1064
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,883
I could stick you up my ass,
small fry.

1065
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,621
Yeah? You sure it ain't
too sore from last night?

1066
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,526
You got some lip on you, midget.

1067
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:10,429
Well, these lips were on
your wife's pussy last night.

1068
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:13,263
Why don't you dust that
thing off once in a while?

1069
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:14,894
Asshole.

1070
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:20,672
I pissed my pants.

1071
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:22,074
Oh, shut up.

1072
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:48,769
Santa.

1073
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:00,074
Santa?

1074
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,849
What?

1075
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:05,950
What are you doing?

1076
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:08,790
Nothing.

1077
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:11,793
You going to work today?

1078
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,029
Not really.

1079
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:19,829
You just gonna sit there?

1080
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:22,903
Yeah.

1081
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:25,668
Just let me alone, okay?

1082
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:31,113
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, kid?

1083
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,647
Yeah?

1084
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:38,550
I want you to take this letter.

1085
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:42,751
When the paramedics come
to bag Santa up,

1086
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:44,850
there's gonna be
some cops there.

1087
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:48,124
I want you to make sure that
those cops get that envelope.

1088
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:50,062
What is it?

1089
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:53,124
It just tells
all the bad things that...

1090
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:58,029
What the fuck happened
to your eye?

1091
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,674
Fucking little prick!

1092
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:06,276
So you like to give little kids
black eyes, huh?

1093
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:10,911
How 'bout you, huh?!
You want some?!

1094
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:13,580
Anybody else?
Anybody else? Come on!

1095
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:15,385
Yeah, there you go.

1096
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:35,970
You know, I think
I've turned a corner.

1097
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:40,148
Yeah?
You fucking petites now?

1098
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,582
No. I'm not talking about that.

1099
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:48,248
I beat the shit
out of some kids today.

1100
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:50,588
But it was for a purpose.

1101
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,556
It made me feel good
about myself.

1102
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,759
It was like I did something
constructive with my life.

1103
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:01,598
I don't know.

1104
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,002
Like I accomplished something.

1105
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:10,243
You need many years of therapy.

1106
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:14,373
Many, many, many
fuckin' years of therapy.

1107
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,711
Okay. You don't drink,
which is smart on your part.

1108
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:19,879
But being sober can put you
at a disadvantage

1109
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:21,422
when it comes to violence.

1110
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,651
I can't box worth a shit, see.

1111
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:27,560
But I'm good in a fight
because I can't feel anything.

1112
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:30,155
You, you're gonna feel
everything.

1113
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:32,900
Okay.

1114
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:36,665
Now put your dukes up.
Let me see what you got.

1115
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:37,763
This is bullshit!

1116
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,173
Give me one good reason why I
should even consider doing this.

1117
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:43,768
'Cause I let 2,000 kids
spit in my face for your ass.

1118
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:44,904
That's why.

1119
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,743
Now, I'm asking you
for this one thing.

1120
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:48,510
Come on, look at the kid.

1121
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:51,214
He is pathetic.

1122
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:52,879
Yeah, he's just a little...

1123
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:55,116
He's a fucking retard.

1124
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:58,452
Yeah, let's show him
a couple of things

1125
01:09:58,527 --> 01:09:59,858
so he can defend himself, then.

1126
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:01,556
Unless you're scared.

1127
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:04,795
All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

1128
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:06,266
Marcus is a bully, right?

1129
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,303
He's gonna pull your underwear
up out of your pants.

1130
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,598
Now, what do you do?

1131
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:10,730
I don't know.

1132
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:12,068
God damn it!
You don't know?

1133
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:15,474
If somebody wants to pull your
underwear up out of your pants,

1134
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:16,738
you have to get mad.

1135
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:18,939
Yeah, kid, come on.
Get mad.

1136
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:20,413
Scream at him.

1137
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:23,640
Jesus fucking Christ.

1138
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:26,051
Listen at him.
He's a fucking faggot.

1139
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:28,389
Loud! Scream!

1140
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:30,391
Be loud! Be mean!

1141
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:31,653
Piss him off!
Come on!

1142
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:32,955
Aah!

1143
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:41,495
You don't
hit people in the balls,

1144
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:42,730
you asshole!

1145
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:44,773
Aah!

1146
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,172
What the fuck's wrong with you?
He's just a kid.

1147
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,143
- Fuck you, Willie!
- Ow!

1148
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:51,641
God damn it.

1149
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:53,375
I told you
I didn't want to do this!

1150
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:55,417
Making me...
Ohh!

1151
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:58,852
Oh, shit.

1152
01:11:01,357 --> 01:11:04,724
Kid, maybe you shouldn't spend
so much time around me.

1153
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,256
You sneaky little prick.

1154
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:11,933
Fuck you!
Little bastard!

1155
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,332
Get off me!

1156
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:23,841
Shut up. That's not even
what you said.

1157
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:25,675
Oh, God damn it,
I forgot about that.

1158
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:28,376
We got a fucking nursing home
around here.

1159
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,577
Well, we can go in another room.

1160
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:38,025
She does look kind of still,
doesn't she?

1161
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,487
Hey, Granny?

1162
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,197
Hey, Granny.

1163
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,239
Hey, there, Granny?

1164
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,006
Oh, Granny.

1165
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:00,248
Oh, my God.

1166
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,840
What the fuck?

1167
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:05,547
Oh, shit.

1168
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:10,319
- Roger!
- God!

1169
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:12,986
- God damn it! Shit!
- You're home.

1170
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:16,657
- Please just tap me.
- Let me fix some sandwiches.

1171
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:53,428
Hello, little boy.

1172
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:55,060
Hello.
Santa...

1173
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:57,867
I know that Christmas Eve
is in a couple days,

1174
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,498
and you have to fly around
the world

1175
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:03,739
and give presents to everyone,
and you won't be around anymore.

1176
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:04,744
Yeah?

1177
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:07,338
So I thought I'd give you
your present now.

1178
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,315
What the fuck is it?

1179
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,256
It's a wooden pickle.

1180
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:21,319
- Why'd you paint it brown?
- It's not paint.

1181
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,798
It's blood from when I cut
my hand making it for you.

1182
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,630
Oh.

1183
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:30,035
Well, shit, kid, I don't know.

1184
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:31,766
I...

1185
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,301
Thanks.

1186
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:37,242
You're welcome.

1187
01:13:37,312 --> 01:13:38,745
Good night, Santa.

1188
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:43,645
Good night, Mrs. Santa's sister.

1189
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,285
Good night, sweetie.

1190
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,691
Oh, my God.

1191
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,192
That was so sweet.

1192
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:55,230
He's a really sweet kid,
isn't he?

1193
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:57,458
Yeah, I guess so.

1194
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,203
Come on, baby.

1195
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:04,496
Come here.

1196
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:07,364
What?

1197
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,638
Oh, nothing.
I'm all right.

1198
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:15,541
Just a little tired.

1199
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:17,448
Oh.

1200
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:28,523
Santa!

1201
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:30,792
God damn it!
Whoa! Shit!

1202
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:33,096
Want to see my report card?

1203
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:34,999
You scared the holy shit
out of me.

1204
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:36,332
Think I did good?

1205
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:39,465
How would I know? I haven't seen
the fuckin' thing yet.

1206
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:45,913
Who the fuck is Thurman?

1207
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,643
- Is your name Thurman?
- Yeah.

1208
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:51,884
Thurman Merman?

1209
01:14:51,954 --> 01:14:53,512
Yeah.

1210
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:56,715
Jesus.

1211
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,555
So, you think I did good?

1212
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:04,699
What do you care
what I think, anyway?

1213
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:06,893
Hell, I guess you did better
than I did.

1214
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,335
I never got any B's.

1215
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:11,929
I thought maybe at least
since I did good in school,

1216
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,565
maybe you'd bring me a present.

1217
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:15,507
'Cause last year
and the year before that,

1218
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:17,704
you didn't bring me
any presents.

1219
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:23,114
Even though I'm a dipshit loser.

1220
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,517
Jesus fucking Christ, kid!

1221
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:32,651
Why do you talk about
yourself that way?!

1222
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:35,891
Let me give you some news.
I'm not Santa Claus, all right?

1223
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:38,455
Take a look at me.
Do I look like Santa Claus?

1224
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,002
As a matter of fact,
I'm living fucking proof

1225
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:43,299
that there's not a Santa Claus.

1226
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:46,200
I know there's no Santa.

1227
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:48,709
I just thought maybe you'd
want to give me a present

1228
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:50,472
'cause we're friends.

1229
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:16,632
There he is.

1230
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:20,505
That lousy, leather-faced,
frog-eyed, motherfucker.

1231
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,874
- Good night, Gin.
- Good night.

1232
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:57,002
Jesus, Mother Mary, and Joseph.

1233
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:58,376
What is the problem now?

1234
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,142
I'm sorry.
The van stalled.

1235
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,511
Will you give us a jump, please?

1236
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:05,485
I'll be dipped in dog shit.

1237
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:07,613
Do I look like
an auto mechanic to you?

1238
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:16,864
I appreciate it.

1239
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:22,096
All right, small fry,
help yourself.

1240
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:27,800
I can't reach it.

1241
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:29,537
Jesus Christ, give me that.

1242
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:30,805
Thanks.

1243
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:34,182
All right, hit it.

1244
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:08,006
Oh, my.
What a terrible accident.

1245
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:09,209
Mm-mm-mmm.

1246
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:10,649
- Is he dead?
- No.

1247
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,085
But it looks like
you broke most of his ribs.

1248
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:17,785
I'd say maybe 50% of them,
or do you think 30%?

1249
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,588
I needed more
of a running start.

1250
01:18:19,661 --> 01:18:21,925
I couldn't build up
enough speed.

1251
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:40,209
Merry Christmas Eve.

1252
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:43,779
Got you a little something.

1253
01:18:43,852 --> 01:18:45,717
You shouldn't have.

1254
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:48,085
You should put that stuff
in the kitchen.

1255
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:53,157
God damn, you look good.

1256
01:18:57,799 --> 01:19:00,495
Here you go.

1257
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:05,395
Little behind there, sweetie?

1258
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:07,772
We don't need any more
of this shit.

1259
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:11,870
"Christmas keeps us connected
to each other in peace.

1260
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:15,644
The angel is going to tell
everyone in the world."

1261
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:21,450
Aspirin?

1262
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:49,909
Shit!

1263
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:51,605
Jesus.

1264
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:55,207
Santa?

1265
01:20:57,252 --> 01:20:59,948
- What?
- I was gonna make sandwiches.

1266
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:02,649
I could make you one
before you leave.

1267
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:06,960
Listen, kid, I don't know.

1268
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:10,122
I got shit to do and everything.

1269
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:17,197
Okay, make me some sandwiches.

1270
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:19,399
I gotta go to the mall
and talk to somebody.

1271
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:20,532
I'll be back.

1272
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:21,405
For dinner?

1273
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:23,307
Yeah, that's what I said.
Yeah.

1274
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,471
How many sandwiches do you want?

1275
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:28,576
Uh, a bunch.

1276
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:30,709
How much lettuce do you want?

1277
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:35,152
I don't know.
The usual amount.

1278
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,316
Whatever the hell people do.
Whatever you think.

1279
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:38,723
Okay.

1280
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:57,908
Have a very merry Christmas.

1281
01:21:57,946 --> 01:21:59,675
- Merry Christmas.
- Good night.

1282
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:01,079
Merry Christmas.

1283
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:02,275
Good night.

1284
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:03,942
- Good night.
- Okay! Happy holiday!

1285
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:05,486
Attention, shoppers.

1286
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:07,885
The store will be closing
in five minutes.

1287
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:09,685
We wish you all
a merry Christmas,

1288
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,989
a happy Hanukkah,
and a joyous Kwanzaa.

1289
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:31,645
All right, hold it steady.

1290
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:38,219
Oh, yeah, shit, let's do it.

1291
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,585
Oh, Christ.

1292
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:46,716
Merry Christmas.

1293
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:49,662
Good night.

1294
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:52,991
Merry Christmas, Willie.

1295
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:54,695
Up your ass.

1296
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:23,258
Aaaah!

1297
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:27,633
Whoa!

1298
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:55,495
Oh, shit.

1299
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:57,823
What?

1300
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:03,233
What?

1301
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:05,397
It's a Kitnerboy Redoubt.

1302
01:24:05,473 --> 01:24:06,167
So?

1303
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:07,469
Remember Andy Pitz?

1304
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:08,839
Andy Pitzorella?
Yeah.

1305
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:10,070
No, Andy Ripitski.

1306
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:12,010
Andy Pitzorella
was Andy Blue Balls.

1307
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,310
Since he got married,
they call him Andy Pitzorella.

1308
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,145
What's your fucking point?!

1309
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:17,912
They say he can get
into anything.

1310
01:24:17,986 --> 01:24:19,920
Anything.

1311
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:22,286
They say he's been
in Margaret Thatcher's pussy.

1312
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:23,722
And that's a good thing?

1313
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,453
So what the fuck
are you getting at?

1314
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:27,017
When I was
in the joint with him,

1315
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:30,758
he told me that the Kitnerboy
Redoubt can't be cracked.

1316
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:33,665
Are you shittin' me?

1317
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:36,226
Are you telling me
that after I propped you up,

1318
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:39,000
held you together,
smiled for all those kids,

1319
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:41,269
danced for all those
fucking housewives

1320
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:44,573
in a fucking lime-green,
fucking velvet elf costume,

1321
01:24:44,646 --> 01:24:46,773
that you cannot
get in this fucking safe?!

1322
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:49,544
Is that what you're
telling me?! Huh?!

1323
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:53,383
No, I'm just saying
it's gonna take a minute.

1324
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,370
Fuck.

1325
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:29,714
Shit.

1326
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,486
34C.

1327
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:17,264
Fuck!

1328
01:26:50,305 --> 01:26:51,966
Piece of cake.

1329
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:56,371
I gotta get one more thing.
I'll be right back.

1330
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:21,933
Oh, shit.
Which one did he say?

1331
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:43,353
I'll bet the store dick
don't want this.

1332
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:45,790
Store dick don't want shit.

1333
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:50,264
What do you mean?

1334
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:52,196
Store dick's dead.

1335
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,735
Store dick don't want shit.

1336
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:57,901
He's dead, huh?

1337
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:02,605
I didn't even know he was sick.

1338
01:28:02,677 --> 01:28:04,201
Willie...

1339
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:06,747
this has been
a long time coming.

1340
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:10,750
Every year, you're worse.
Every year, less reliable.

1341
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:13,218
More booze.
More bullshit.

1342
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:14,755
More buttfucking.

1343
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:18,155
Sure, the three B's.

1344
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:20,820
You gotta be able to rely,
Willie.

1345
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:25,989
You people are monsters.

1346
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:28,399
There's no joy in this for me.

1347
01:28:31,906 --> 01:28:34,101
I'm not talking about
you taking me out.

1348
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:36,075
That part, I get.

1349
01:28:39,714 --> 01:28:41,545
But look at all that shit.

1350
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:46,887
Do you really need
all that shit?

1351
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:50,683
For Christ sakes,
it's Christmas.

1352
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:52,419
It is Christmas, Willie.

1353
01:28:52,493 --> 01:28:54,051
But this is what we do.

1354
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:56,358
We get the shit.

1355
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:59,559
Christmastime, we get the shit.

1356
01:28:59,634 --> 01:29:02,797
Because we are men and Lois.

1357
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,967
It is Christmas, Willie.

1358
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:09,100
And we are men and Lois.

1359
01:29:10,611 --> 01:29:12,442
What you waiting for, honey?

1360
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:15,482
Come on, plug him.

1361
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:21,287
Goodbye, Willie.

1362
01:29:23,624 --> 01:29:25,148
- Drop the gun.
- Huh?!

1363
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:28,486
And you, Santa,
drop the elephant.

1364
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:30,463
- Where did you come from?
- Tipped off.

1365
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:32,226
Shit, that fucking kid.

1366
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:35,098
All three of you are in so much
shit, it's almost unbelievable.

1367
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,402
Marcus, hop on!

1368
01:29:58,626 --> 01:30:00,719
Fuck me.

1369
01:30:34,962 --> 01:30:36,122
Hey, hey!

1370
01:30:57,318 --> 01:31:00,776
This is Christmas, and the kid's
getting his fucking present.

1371
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:27,375
Halt, police!
Put your hands up!

1372
01:31:27,448 --> 01:31:30,042
I said freeze!
Freeze!

1373
01:31:36,624 --> 01:31:40,424
- Aaaah!
- Aaaah!

1374
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:25,638
"Dear kid...

1375
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:27,435
I hope that you got my present

1376
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:29,806
and that there wasn't
too much blood on it,

1377
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:32,277
although there was blood
on the present you gave me,

1378
01:32:32,346 --> 01:32:34,109
which didn't keep me
from enjoying it.

1379
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:37,241
So maybe the blood doesn't
matter so much, I guess."

1380
01:32:39,487 --> 01:32:42,581
"Anyway, just in case
they took it as evidence,

1381
01:32:42,657 --> 01:32:44,989
I'm also sending you a T-shirt.

1382
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:47,550
I hope it's the right size."

1383
01:32:48,195 --> 01:32:49,594
"I'm healing up good,

1384
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:52,428
and they tell me
that I will soon be 100%,

1385
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,365
even with 8 bullets
dug out of me,

1386
01:32:54,435 --> 01:32:56,460
because they didn't hit
any vital organs,

1387
01:32:56,537 --> 01:32:59,199
just my liver,
which is fucked anyway.

1388
01:32:59,273 --> 01:33:00,934
Ha ha ha.

1389
01:33:01,008 --> 01:33:03,203
Thank you for giving
that letter to the cops.

1390
01:33:03,277 --> 01:33:06,041
I forgot I asked you to do it,
but it's a good thing you did

1391
01:33:06,113 --> 01:33:08,547
or Santa's little helper
would've plugged his ass.

1392
01:33:08,616 --> 01:33:09,913
Now the cops know I wrote it,

1393
01:33:09,984 --> 01:33:11,952
which is gonna keep my ass
out of jail.

1394
01:33:12,019 --> 01:33:13,509
That, plus everyone agreeing

1395
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:16,113
that the Phoenix police
shooting an unarmed Santa

1396
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:18,750
was even more fucked up
than Rodney King."

1397
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,058
"The cops are treating me
like fucking royalty now,

1398
01:33:22,129 --> 01:33:23,687
which is new in my experience.

1399
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:25,755
They're gonna make me
a sensitivity counselor

1400
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:27,198
so that tragedies like this

1401
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:30,135
will never again embarrass
the whole fucking department.

1402
01:33:30,204 --> 01:33:33,230
I told the cops you had no one
to take the fuck care of you,

1403
01:33:33,307 --> 01:33:35,502
so they set it up
with Mrs. Santa's sister

1404
01:33:35,576 --> 01:33:37,066
watching you
till your dad gets back

1405
01:33:37,144 --> 01:33:38,577
in one year and three months.

1406
01:33:38,646 --> 01:33:41,581
They made her a guardian
pro tem or some such shit.

1407
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:44,880
Anyway, she seems to like you
and your house and Jacuzzi.

1408
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:46,180
I sent her some money,

1409
01:33:46,253 --> 01:33:47,652
so if you play
your cards right,

1410
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:50,885
you can probably get her
to buy you something.

1411
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:53,392
As for my little helper,
I'm sorry to have to tell you

1412
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:55,656
that him and his
prune-faced, mail-order wife

1413
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:57,994
are gonna be exploring
mountains with your dad.

1414
01:33:58,065 --> 01:34:00,363
I hope your dad doesn't go
sucking shit from them

1415
01:34:00,434 --> 01:34:01,662
like I did.

1416
01:34:01,736 --> 01:34:04,500
They're supposed to let me
out of this hospital room soon,

1417
01:34:04,572 --> 01:34:06,665
so get some sandwiches ready.

1418
01:34:06,741 --> 01:34:09,835
Until then, don't take
no shit from nobody,

1419
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:11,502
least of all yourself.

1420
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:13,638
Ho ho ho.

1421
01:34:13,714 --> 01:34:16,478
Your pal, Santa."

1422
01:34:19,453 --> 01:34:20,579
Hey, loser.

1423
01:34:22,256 --> 01:34:25,623
I hear your buddy's not here
to protect you anymore.

1424
01:34:27,294 --> 01:34:29,524
See you got me a new bike.

1425
01:34:29,597 --> 01:34:31,360
Thanks a lot.

1426
01:34:32,033 --> 01:34:33,762
I'm talking to you, fat-ass!

1427
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:35,563
Aaah!

1428
01:36:52,206 --> 01:37:02,206
