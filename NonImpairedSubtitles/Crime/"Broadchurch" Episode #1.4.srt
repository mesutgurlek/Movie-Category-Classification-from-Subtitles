1
00:00:03,273 --> 00:00:05,273
Previously on Broadchurch...

2
00:00:09,993 --> 00:00:12,433
You have to change all of this.
I can't.

3
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:14,473
If you don't, you'll end up dead.

4
00:00:14,513 --> 00:00:17,753
If you or your family need to speak,
you call me.

5
00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:19,513
He was put in a boat.

6
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:20,993
Mark, do you own a boat?
Yeah.

7
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:23,953
Do you know what it would do that
family, to this town if it was Mark?

8
00:00:23,993 --> 00:00:25,993
What are you looking for?
Blood.

9
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:29,193
Don't look for the person who killed
him because it won't help.

10
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:31,433
Cos it will only make you upset.

11
00:00:31,473 --> 00:00:33,713
Because you know the person
who killed him well.

12
00:00:33,753 --> 00:00:36,193
Did you kill Danny?
You think I could kill my own son?

13
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:39,113
What if Danny found out about
Mark and Becca Fisher?

14
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:42,713
Father kills his own son to keep him
quiet? You think that's impossible?

15
00:00:42,753 --> 00:00:44,193
I don't know.

16
00:00:46,193 --> 00:00:49,673
One of the night-boats radioed in.
No sign of anyone on it.

17
00:00:49,713 --> 00:00:52,433
Who do we call? Harbour master?
Coastguard?

18
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,913
I need people out there collecting
every piece.

19
00:00:55,953 --> 00:00:58,193
The tide's coming in.
It will wash up soon enough.

20
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:00,233
No! Get it done!

21
00:01:00,258 --> 00:01:07,696

22
00:01:26,873 --> 00:01:28,873
Hello?

23
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:32,593
You had Mark in most of the day.
Just routine.

24
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:36,553
Is he a suspect?
Oh, Beth, it's 4:30 in the morning.

25
00:01:36,593 --> 00:01:40,873
No, I have to know. Have you ruled
him out for definite? At least tell
me that.

26
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:44,313
Beth, please, it's not as simple as
that. Of course it is.

27
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:46,353
Do you think he killed Danny?

28
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:52,353
There were gaps in his movements and
we really needed him to explain them

29
00:01:52,393 --> 00:01:54,033
and he wasn't willing to do that.

30
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:56,073
Where was he?

31
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:58,913
You need to ask him.
Just tell me.

32
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,753
Beth...

33
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:03,633
I saw him tonight with Becca Fisher.

34
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:08,633
Does he know you saw him?

35
00:02:08,993 --> 00:02:11,233
You need to tell him. You need to
talk to him.

36
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:14,473
I can't do it, Ell.
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

37
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,833
Really I am.

38
00:02:19,713 --> 00:02:21,713
Who's that?

39
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:27,113
Is that Paul?
How long's he been standing there?

40
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,433
Morning.
Morning.

41
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:44,606
Morning, Oliver. Don't normally see
you this early. Been in all night?

42
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:46,926
Yeah, almost. Sort of.
You all right?

43
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:51,126
No. Look, I've been doing some
digging on someone and I found
something.

44
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,166
Well, show me.

45
00:02:57,846 --> 00:02:59,366
Do the police know about this?

46
00:03:06,126 --> 00:03:09,526
It can't be Mark Latimer's boat.
That's still with our forensics.

47
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:12,646
Is this it?

48
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:14,846
On earth we say,
'Good morning, how you doing?'

49
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:18,286
I've told him. Makes no difference.
Connected to the Latimer death?

50
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:21,166
Traces of accelerant suggest the
boat was doused in petrol.

51
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:24,806
I'm finding flecks of glass and
fibres of cloth within the wood.

52
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:28,806
If I had to guess I'd say a lit rag
inside a bottle was used to ignite
it.

53
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:33,646
If someone took the boat out that far
at, what, 4am, to burn it, how did
they get back?

54
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:36,806
The rear section had marks where
an outboard motor might have gone.

55
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:39,006
They used that to get back on another
boat.

56
00:03:39,046 --> 00:03:42,046
Or there was more than one of them.
Why burn this boat?

57
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:44,006
This piece might hold the key.

58
00:03:44,046 --> 00:03:46,886
We sent a sample back for match and
analysis. Look in the grain.

59
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,806
Strands of hair.

60
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:56,726
Outstanding. Out-bloody-standing!

61
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:58,526
Oh, Miller, we've got them. Keep
going.

62
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:00,766
I want to know
as soon as you have confirmation.

63
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:02,686
Come on, Miller, no hanging around.

64
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:06,366
That's cheered you up.

65
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:09,766
100 quid says that's the boat they
used and those hairs belonged to
Danny.

66
00:04:09,806 --> 00:04:13,086
They're panicking, Miller.
Fantastic. That is exactly what we
want.

67
00:04:13,126 --> 00:04:15,126
Starting to show themselves.

68
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,726
And they're an amateur.
Haven't done this before.

69
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:20,166
That's clumsy - burning the boat
like that and so soon.

70
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:22,206
That's a big mistake they've made.

71
00:04:22,246 --> 00:04:26,446
That's like oxygen to us. Breathe it
in, Miller, we're getting somewhere.

72
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:32,926
Hello?

73
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:35,606
27 unanswered calls and finally she
picks up.

74
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:37,966
Come on, explain why I shouldn't
sack you.

75
00:04:38,006 --> 00:04:41,926
I've taken leave, that's all. I'm
owed loads and I've got a good story.

76
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:44,886
I specifically told you not to go.
We're gonna use an agency.

77
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:48,606
The police are struggling. I don't
think this is gonna be done in a day
or two.

78
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:50,846
Why do I care? Why will our readers
care?

79
00:04:50,886 --> 00:04:53,846
Model family, two kids. Dad's a
plumber.

80
00:04:54,486 --> 00:04:57,806
Quiet estate, idyllic market town -
definition of normal.

81
00:04:57,846 --> 00:05:00,166
The mum - how photogenic?

82
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,486
Very photogenic. English rose.

83
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,206
Get me an exclusive with her, nice
photo, and I'll look at it.

84
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,766
OK.

85
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,206
Where the hell have you been?
Running. Am I not allowed to run?

86
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:40,486
I didn't know you were coming.
Just bringing you up to date.

87
00:05:40,526 --> 00:05:44,926
I was just saying we've asked
forensics to examine Danny's
clothing in greater detail.

88
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:47,526
We're following up on leads
from the house-to-house.

89
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:50,166
Yeah, now you've stopped messing
around with me.

90
00:05:50,206 --> 00:05:52,246
Don't be a wanker, Mark.

91
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:57,366
We're holding a public meeting
at the school later today.

92
00:05:57,406 --> 00:06:00,286
Just to keep the town up to date,
answer questions.

93
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,726
You don't have to be there. I'm gonna
go. On behalf of all of us.

94
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:06,686
You don't have to, Mum.
I want to. Keep busy.

95
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:09,806
Why is there nothing more in the
paper about Danny?

96
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:12,126
It's like page 12, couple of
paragraphs.

97
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,686
Don't judge this investigation
by what's in the press.

98
00:06:14,726 --> 00:06:18,446
No, we were saying if there's more in
the papers it might jog people's
memories.

99
00:06:18,486 --> 00:06:22,086
What if there's somebody out there?
They might have seen something.

100
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:25,646
If we had more in the papers...
Please, let us handle the media.

101
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,686
We have the experience in this.

102
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:32,926
We're all asking, no offence,
but why's it taking so long?

103
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:34,246
Trevor, how many...

104
00:06:34,286 --> 00:06:37,166
Multiple complex crime scenes,
particularly at the beach.

105
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:40,646
Lack of CCTV in key areas.

106
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:44,166
Er... absence of witnesses seeing
Danny on the night he sneaked out.

107
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:47,246
We've a lot of information still to
process. We'll get there.

108
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:51,046
Susan Wright. How many people
do you even have working on it?

109
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:54,046
I heard you were short staffed.

110
00:06:54,086 --> 00:06:57,646
We have the right resources
for an investigation of this size.
Next question.

111
00:06:57,686 --> 00:06:59,646
I've just come from the pier and
there's...

112
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,286
What did she say her name was?
Susan Wright.

113
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:04,646
New information came to light
overnight.

114
00:07:04,686 --> 00:07:07,366
And we have to examine it
without contamination.

115
00:07:07,406 --> 00:07:10,966
Is that the boat that was on fire?
My brother saw it when he was out
with his pots.

116
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:20,686
Erm... It's too early to talk about
specific types of evidence.

117
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:24,806
You said the tents on the beach
would come down at any moment and
they're still there,

118
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:26,686
and now you're adding bloody great
vans.

119
00:07:26,726 --> 00:07:28,886
You have to understand
the work going on there.

120
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:31,366
Every grain of sand has to be gone
through.

121
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:35,046
Every cigarette butt or stray hair,
shard of plastic,

122
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:38,446
fingernail, toenail, piece of skin
has to be tested.

123
00:07:38,886 --> 00:07:42,086
We will do everything we can to limit
the effect on your livelihoods,

124
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:46,566
but my priority is to a thorough
and efficient investigation.

125
00:07:46,606 --> 00:07:49,286
But low-key.
We don't want the name Broadchurch

126
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:51,726
to be a byword for murder like
Sandbrook.

127
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:03,486
I told you there was a boat.
God, you're just what I need.

128
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:06,446
Great. A boat. There's hundreds
round here. You got lucky.

129
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,006
Lucky. Yeah, well, did you look for
it, eh?

130
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:10,926
Does Beth know you didn't follow that
up?

131
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:13,366
How about you heed my very strong
advice?

132
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:16,166
Stay away from her. Do not get
involved.

133
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:18,566
Right?

134
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:25,286
Oh! Hey! There he is!

135
00:08:29,646 --> 00:08:31,726
You're Liz, right? Danny's grandma.

136
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:38,566
You must really miss him.

137
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:45,406
Oh, he shone, that boy.

138
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:48,326
I promised myself I wouldn't do this.

139
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:52,846
I'm the strong one in all this.
I just want them to catch the sod who
did it.

140
00:08:56,006 --> 00:08:58,166
I'm Karen. I work for the Herald.

141
00:08:59,846 --> 00:09:02,646
We're not talking to the press.
No, I know.

142
00:09:02,686 --> 00:09:04,806
But can I just say one thing?

143
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:10,046
Just be sure you're getting the best
advice. I'd hate for Danny to be
ignored.

144
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:17,719
Hi.
All right?

145
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:21,039
You said Mark Latimer didn't fix a
burst pipe at the hut on the cliff.

146
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:23,399
Yeah.
He did. We checked his paperwork.

147
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:27,319
He said he got the keys off you and
you even arranged the cheque for him.

148
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,439
Must have got it wrong. Now if you
don't mind, I gotta be somewhere.

149
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,919
The longer this goes on the more
everyone wants to get involved,
stick their oar in.

150
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,959
Develop their pet theory.

151
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,279
People getting restless, too many
opinions. I don't like it.

152
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,599
Here we go again.

153
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:52,239
Will you pass on to Beth and Mark,
whenever they feel able to talk,
come to us, to me.

154
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,279
They know we do things properly.
I'll make sure they know.

155
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:58,039
And Oliver has got something else to
tell you.

156
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:00,399
Well, we always love hearing from
Oliver.

157
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,439
I found this on Jack Marshall,
who runs the newsagent's here.

158
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:09,199
He was in prison before he came
here. He's got a previous conviction
for underage sex.

159
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,959
Don't try and avoid me.

160
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,359
I know where you live.

161
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,199
I know what your van looks like.
I told you, I don't want to see you.

162
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,279
It's not that simple, though, is it?
It is.

163
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:35,319
Cos I'm telling you it is.

164
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:39,479
We're connected now, you and me.

165
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,119
- You can't just turn your back.
- I can.

166
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,559
I don't want you near me.
You may not like it...

167
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,719
but it can't be undone.

168
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,639
So, you and me need to work out
what we're gonna do.

169
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,799
I ain't talking to you.
Do you understand?

170
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,839
You stay away!

171
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:19,719
A few days ago I told the police
about evidence they should look for.

172
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,999
They took no notice.

173
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,359
Now they've got that evidence, but it
was burned before they got to it.

174
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,519
It makes it harder to analyse it.
Why are you telling me this?

175
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,039
Because I can help. I can help.

176
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,079
But I need to be taken seriously, and
that's...

177
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:37,119
It's not happening right now.

178
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,439
What if you're wrong? Beth, I've got
no reason to lie to you.

179
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:50,119
I wish... I wish we'd never had cause
to meet.

180
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:52,679
But what I have told you is genuine.

181
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,159
And you need to convince the police.

182
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:03,359
Is this about the postman?
The one who was arguing with Danny?

183
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,359
No, though we did talk to him. He
said he never had an argument with
Danny that day.

184
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,319
Load of rubbish. I know what I saw.

185
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,959
Tell us about your conviction
for sex with a minor, Jack.

186
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,559
So... we're into the muck-raking,
are we?

187
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:25,679
Just wanna establish the facts.
You didn't mention it when we spoke.

188
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,799
It's nothing to do with anyone.

189
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,959
Nothing to do with Danny.
You help with the Sea Brigade.

190
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:37,119
That requires CRB checks
cross-referenced
with the Sex Offenders' Register.

191
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:41,439
I am not a sex offender.
That conviction was a farce.

192
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:42,879
I'm not on any register.

193
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,919
Only because it happened
before the Register came into being.

194
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:49,199
Why didn't you tell us about it?
You've got the file, haven't you?

195
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:52,519
I've served my time.
You should have declared it.

196
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:55,239
Put up a little sign, should I?
'Ex-convict here'.

197
00:12:56,647 --> 00:12:58,367
I came here to get away from that.

198
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:00,636
I am not what you're insinuating.

199
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:04,156
When did you last see Danny Latimer?

200
00:13:04,196 --> 00:13:08,316
I told you, the day before he was
found. He came in, did his paper
round.

201
00:13:08,356 --> 00:13:11,036
What about the night of Danny's
death? Where were you then?

202
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:15,276
In, on my own, reading a book.

203
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:18,556
Anyone vouch for that?
Only the book.

204
00:13:19,476 --> 00:13:21,676
Which book?
Jude The Obscure.

205
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:25,396
You might not like it. Not many
pictures.

206
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,396
We've been told you're a keen
amateur photographer, Jack.

207
00:13:33,876 --> 00:13:36,596
Took a lot of pictures of the boys
in Sea Brigade.

208
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:39,596
I really do pity you.

209
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:42,996
Seeing depravity in perfectly normal
behaviour.

210
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:46,556
I'd hate to be in your mind.

211
00:13:48,676 --> 00:13:53,036
Now, if you've an accusation or
evidence to put to me, let's hear it.

212
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,019
Otherwise, let me go back to work.

213
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:05,019
Why are we relying on journalists
to do our work for us?

214
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,819
He wasn't a suspect. We haven't
prioritised him.

215
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:10,059
Well, make him a priority now.

216
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:27,816
She's here.

217
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:31,256
Summoned to the inner sanctum.
Should I be worried?

218
00:14:31,296 --> 00:14:33,536
Did you set him off looking into Jack
Marshall?

219
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:36,416
No, it had nothing to do... Yeah, I
did. I had a run-in with Jack.

220
00:14:36,456 --> 00:14:39,616
Welcome to the club. Still want a
desk?

221
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:43,656
Definitely. Why would you do that?

222
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:48,816
Better to have you inside the tent
pissing out, than outside the tent
pissing in, I suppose.

223
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:51,976
Mine's white. No sugar.
Huh.

224
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:07,976
Try now.

225
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:11,056
Yeah. Brilliant.

226
00:15:11,096 --> 00:15:13,616
Thanks, mate. Don't know why I didn't
spot it.

227
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:16,056
Did you block the sink, Nige?

228
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:17,896
Why would I do that?
I don't know.

229
00:15:19,656 --> 00:15:21,736
Keep me busy, take my mind off
things.

230
00:15:28,016 --> 00:15:30,016
It's gonna be all right.

231
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:35,256
I know it'll never be the same,
but... I'll keep the business going.

232
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,536
Whenever you're ready to come back
you just say.

233
00:15:38,576 --> 00:15:40,856
No pressure. Just step back in.

234
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,376
Thanks, mate.

235
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,696
Can I cook for you? This weekend.
Sunday lunch, all of you.

236
00:15:50,536 --> 00:15:53,016
Nah, I don't think so, Nige.
Still got to eat, mate.

237
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:55,576
You've done it for the rest of us
often enough.

238
00:15:55,616 --> 00:15:58,536
I'm good with beef. You all like
beef?

239
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,776
Yeah, all right.
Come on.

240
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:20,176
You asked us here for this?
Tell them.

241
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,416
Danny wants people to know
he was killed by someone he knew.

242
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:32,336
This is offensive. I'm calling a halt
right now. I told you about the boat.

243
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:34,896
You didn't listen and now you've
found a boat.

244
00:16:34,936 --> 00:16:37,856
I want you to hear him out, please.
Just hear him out.

245
00:16:38,816 --> 00:16:40,816
Tell her.

246
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:42,736
Beth, we checked Steve's record.

247
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:45,576
He's bankrupt with previous
convictions for vehicle theft,

248
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:48,096
petty theft and conspiracy to
defraud.

249
00:16:48,136 --> 00:16:49,336
No.
What?

250
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:51,936
Right. Out.
No. No, Beth...

251
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:53,976
Beth, Beth...
Come on!

252
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:56,176
And you're a bloody idiot for
letting him in.

253
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,216
It's got nothing to do with this.
Beth!

254
00:16:58,256 --> 00:17:01,496
Look, I don't know if you are
mentally ill,

255
00:17:01,536 --> 00:17:04,296
a liar, or somebody who believes
they're telling the truth,

256
00:17:04,336 --> 00:17:06,896
but I have to find this killer
and prove my case in court.

257
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:09,416
I deal in facts. All you're giving
her is fantasy.

258
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:16,136
Pete is now gonna escort you to your
vehicle and you are gonna stay away
from this house.

259
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:19,376
Final warning. I see you again,
I will have you in prison.

260
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:29,656
Why would he do that?
I haven't given him any money.

261
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:32,936
In two weeks he'll speak to the
press, in six months he'll write a
book:

262
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:36,816
How I Solved The Broadchurch Murder.
All those books are in the bookshop
in town.

263
00:17:40,136 --> 00:17:42,136
Oh, my God.

264
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:49,376
I'm so alone.

265
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,456
Beth, have you spoken to Mark?
I can't.

266
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:53,496
You've got to.

267
00:17:56,736 --> 00:17:58,736
No, no, no, no!

268
00:18:16,216 --> 00:18:17,776
There you go, love.
Thanks.

269
00:18:17,816 --> 00:18:20,936
Thrill ride round the bay.
Best 15 quid she'll ever spend.

270
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:23,416
Kids go half-price.

271
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:25,456
Perfectly safe.

272
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:28,736
Looks good.
Er... Maggie. I edit the Echo.

273
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,496
Yeah, I know. I saw you at the
meeting.

274
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:33,816
You're Susan.
Yeah.

275
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:35,416
Or is it Elaine?

276
00:18:37,256 --> 00:18:41,656
Only I've got a picture of you with
the Sea Brigade boys under a
different name.

277
00:18:42,136 --> 00:18:44,456
Your people must have wrote it down
wrong.

278
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:48,896
RIB rides! Broadchurch Blaster!

279
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:51,736
Thrill ride round the bay.

280
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:00,496
You still coming to dinner?

281
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:03,176
Joe's going shopping today, so you
can't back out now.

282
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:06,096
I said, didn't I? What we asking
this vicar?

283
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:08,776
Er, he was flagged up in the
house-to-house

284
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:12,136
as one of the few without an alibi on
the night Danny was killed.

285
00:19:12,576 --> 00:19:15,816
Do you know him well? Not really.
Only been here a couple of years.

286
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:17,736
We're not really churchgoers.

287
00:19:17,776 --> 00:19:19,856
Midnight mass, Easter, if we
remember.

288
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:24,576
If you remember Easter? We're
normally doing Easter egg hunts.

289
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:27,376
And so did Christianity fall.

290
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:31,136
What about you, then? You religious?
Yeah.

291
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:35,816
I pray nightly you'll stop asking me
questions.

292
00:19:37,296 --> 00:19:40,016
Liz, his grandmother,
she's one of our sidesmen,

293
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:42,376
and I used to teach the IT club
at Danny's school.

294
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,416
Oh, yeah, Tom did that too.
Yeah.

295
00:19:44,456 --> 00:19:47,776
So you knew Danny quite well.
I wouldn't say really well.

296
00:19:48,776 --> 00:19:51,416
Erm... he was a quick learner. Same as
Tom.

297
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,456
They were good kids, both of them.

298
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:55,376
Why are you taking the IT club?

299
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,496
I try to connect with the community
whatever way I can.

300
00:19:58,536 --> 00:20:00,536
Plus I got asked to.

301
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:05,016
I think the last teacher who really
understood computers had a nervous
breakdown.

302
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:08,336
Mr Broughton. He'd sit there
and laugh to himself. They got him
to
leave.

303
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:11,096
I'm one up from the man
who sits there giggling to himself.

304
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:13,856
Where were you on the night of
Danny's death?

305
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,976
I did talk to your uniformed officers
about this.

306
00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:20,776
I know.

307
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:24,816
I was at home. On my own.

308
00:20:25,616 --> 00:20:29,416
I live in the house at the bottom of
the hill. I was up late trying to
write a sermon.

309
00:20:29,456 --> 00:20:32,136
Trying being the operative word.
Are you often up late?

310
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:36,256
I was on the verge-side about 4:30
the other night, saw you standing
outside the church.

311
00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:38,296
Was that you?

312
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:40,616
OK, er...

313
00:20:42,216 --> 00:20:46,296
Yeah... I have terrible insomnia.

314
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:49,216
I have had for about six or seven
years.

315
00:20:49,256 --> 00:20:54,336
Can't find anything to cure it,
so... I'm often up late, wandering.

316
00:20:54,376 --> 00:20:56,416
That's my best attempt to deal with
it.

317
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,576
Anything specific that triggered it?

318
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:02,416
Not really. No.

319
00:21:02,456 --> 00:21:04,856
You weren't out wandering that
Thursday night?

320
00:21:05,936 --> 00:21:07,936
No, I don't remember it.

321
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,416
How was Danny with computers?

322
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:18,056
Great. They just instinctively get
it.

323
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:23,776
Like I say, with Danny and Tom,
you only have to tell them once and
they got it.

324
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:32,656
Line of sight. You can see the field
that backs onto the Latimer house.

325
00:21:32,696 --> 00:21:34,696
And my house too.

326
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:38,856
I hate what I'm becoming.
A good detective?

327
00:21:39,496 --> 00:21:41,496
Hardened.

328
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:55,393
I'm not here to hassle.

329
00:21:55,394 --> 00:21:57,795
I've been here since day one and I've
left you alone.

330
00:21:57,835 --> 00:21:59,875
It's true. I left one of Danny's
toys at the beach.

331
00:21:59,915 --> 00:22:01,855
She brought it back to me, save it
getting nicked.

332
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,183
But I bumped into Liz at the school
and...

333
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:09,143
I think this should be getting more
coverage. Yeah, so what shall we do?

334
00:22:09,183 --> 00:22:11,183
OK, you're not gonna like this.

335
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:16,103
The reason Danny's death isn't
getting proper attention is it's not
the right profile.

336
00:22:16,143 --> 00:22:19,063
Had Danny been a girl with blonde
hair and a few years younger

337
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:21,743
then this place would be crawling
with reporters by now.

338
00:22:21,783 --> 00:22:25,103
I hope you're kidding.
I'm sorry. It's the way it works.

339
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:28,063
11-year-old boys
go missing from home all the time.

340
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,783
So we're just gonna get ignored, are
we?

341
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:35,743
If you want more focus on this case,
then it's gonna have to come from
you, Beth.

342
00:22:36,903 --> 00:22:38,143
Me? Why me?

343
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:42,103
You tell us your side of things,
how it's been for you, every mum will
respond.

344
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:44,143
I don't know. Do we want this?

345
00:22:45,023 --> 00:22:47,143
Shouldn't we clear it with the
police?

346
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:50,463
It's the Herald. I read the Herald.

347
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:53,423
What if she shows us what she's
written before she sends it in?

348
00:22:53,463 --> 00:22:56,983
Good idea. Would you do that?
Not normally.

349
00:22:57,023 --> 00:23:01,543
Maybe this time if I can get a photo
with Beth and Danny to go with the
article.

350
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:05,103
What do we think?

351
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:16,583
OK.
Yeah?

352
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:34,423
That's it. I want to see this area
covered. Keep going.

353
00:23:34,463 --> 00:23:37,943
Hi, Mr Marshall.
Oliver. Come to help?

354
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,943
Well, could we maybe just talk
inside?

355
00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:44,383
No, we can talk here, can't we? Can't
you see I'm busy? What do you want?

356
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:48,143
OK, erm... I've come across
some information and...

357
00:23:48,423 --> 00:23:51,823
being as we know each other I
thought I should come to you before
it gets out.

358
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,743
Before what gets out?

359
00:23:53,783 --> 00:23:56,303
I'm sorry, there's no easy way of
asking this.

360
00:23:56,343 --> 00:23:58,663
Do you have a conviction for
underage sex?

361
00:23:59,823 --> 00:24:03,143
Why, you little bastard.
I'm not trying to stitch you up.

362
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:06,823
Who told you? The police? I can help
you put your story across.

363
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:09,463
You're all as bad as each other -
gossiping and accusing.

364
00:24:09,503 --> 00:24:11,503
OK, I think you should let go of me.

365
00:24:13,503 --> 00:24:16,983
You've known me how long?
When did I ever do anything improper?

366
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:18,663
OK, if we could go inside and
talk...

367
00:24:18,703 --> 00:24:20,863
So you can trick me into
incriminating myself?

368
00:24:20,903 --> 00:24:23,583
Is that what that bitch your boss
wants? That's a bit...

369
00:24:23,623 --> 00:24:26,143
How can I incriminate you if you're
innocent?

370
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:29,383
They've trained you to be a clever
weasel, haven't they?

371
00:24:29,623 --> 00:24:31,863
Go on. Get away. Go!

372
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,143
Weasel! Go! Go!

373
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:48,523
Oh, you're in a suit.
Is that bad?

374
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:51,693
No, I didn't expect it. We didn't
get poshed up. Neither did I.

375
00:24:52,013 --> 00:24:54,333
Well, there we are, then. Come in.
I bought wine.

376
00:24:54,373 --> 00:24:56,453
That's very kind of you.
And flowers.

377
00:24:56,493 --> 00:24:59,013
Oh, you didn't need to...
And chocolates.

378
00:24:59,053 --> 00:25:01,053
Wow.

379
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:03,493
Wasn't sure which to choose so I got
them all.

380
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:05,933
Bless. Come in.

381
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,133
Thanks.

382
00:25:12,173 --> 00:25:15,013
Alec bought wine and flowers and
chocolates.

383
00:25:15,053 --> 00:25:17,053
Full house - you can come again.

384
00:25:17,693 --> 00:25:20,493
I can call you Alec tonight, not
Hardy or sir?

385
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:22,653
'Here's your dinner, sir.'

386
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:25,373
I don't like Alec. I've never liked
Alec.

387
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:28,733
'Alec.'
You can always choose another one.

388
00:25:28,773 --> 00:25:32,453
Why does everyone use first names so
much, like they all work in
marketing?

389
00:25:32,493 --> 00:25:34,093
Why do people insist on doing that?

390
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:37,173
I mean, if you look at a person I
look at you...

391
00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:41,893
You know I'm talking to you. I don't
need to say your name three times

392
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:45,413
to congratulate myself on remembering
it, to create some...

393
00:25:45,453 --> 00:25:48,093
sort of false intimacy or...

394
00:25:49,764 --> 00:25:52,324
Shall I show you to the dining room?

395
00:26:01,684 --> 00:26:03,784
How did you two meet?
Er, through work.

396
00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:06,377
Joe used to be a paramedic.
Not any more?

397
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:08,417
Gave it up when Fred came along.

398
00:26:09,177 --> 00:26:11,697
I was getting a bit jaded anyway.
Jaded, how?

399
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:14,297
More red tape.

400
00:26:14,337 --> 00:26:18,457
Stuff that stopped us from being
able to help, masquerading as health
and safety.

401
00:26:18,497 --> 00:26:20,497
Where are you from originally?

402
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,497
Cardiff.

403
00:26:24,297 --> 00:26:27,417
Moved down here 13 years ago for
work.

404
00:26:27,457 --> 00:26:29,817
Met Ellie. The rest is history.

405
00:26:31,577 --> 00:26:34,777
You married? This is great food.
You make this yourself?

406
00:26:34,817 --> 00:26:37,817
Mm. Self-taught. Mexican's my
speciality.

407
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:41,177
We should really be having
margaritas, shouldn't we?

408
00:26:41,217 --> 00:26:43,217
No.

409
00:26:44,537 --> 00:26:46,537
Not married. Not any more.

410
00:26:46,577 --> 00:26:49,577
Sorry to hear that. What was it?
The pressures of work?

411
00:26:49,617 --> 00:26:52,097
Sort of. This job does it to you.

412
00:26:52,137 --> 00:26:54,777
Not to us.
No, I didn't mean...

413
00:26:58,017 --> 00:27:00,017
Any erm... any kids?

414
00:27:04,337 --> 00:27:07,497
Daughter. 15. Lives with her mother.

415
00:27:07,537 --> 00:27:09,537
Oh, that must be hard.

416
00:27:18,897 --> 00:27:20,937
Do you think you'll solve this case?
Joe.

417
00:27:20,977 --> 00:27:22,977
Certain.

418
00:27:26,857 --> 00:27:28,857
Good.

419
00:27:29,537 --> 00:27:32,777
Right, I'm gonna have a wee.
No more talking about work.

420
00:27:37,217 --> 00:27:39,217
Well, that's us told.

421
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:42,097
No, no, not for me.
Shut up and drink!

422
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:57,657
Does she like me?

423
00:27:57,977 --> 00:28:00,097
Sorry?
Does she like...

424
00:28:01,377 --> 00:28:03,377
working with me?

425
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,417
You're here for dinner, aren't you?

426
00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:08,017
I think I irritate her.

427
00:28:08,057 --> 00:28:10,057
She hasn't mentioned it.

428
00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:14,217
You bloody liar.

429
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:16,257
I've said nothing.
And yet...

430
00:28:23,257 --> 00:28:25,257
What are you laughing about?

431
00:28:26,777 --> 00:28:28,777
Nothing.

432
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:34,017
Sure you don't want a taxi?
No, no. Walk will be good.

433
00:28:34,057 --> 00:28:36,057
See you in the morning.

434
00:28:36,097 --> 00:28:38,697
That was nice. Thanks, Miller.

435
00:28:41,977 --> 00:28:45,097
A whole evening and it's still
Miller. Unbelievable.

436
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:47,537
I love you, Miller.
Oh, don't you start.

437
00:28:47,577 --> 00:28:50,177
You and your new bloody little mate.

438
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:17,577
Lord... give me the strength
to deal with tomorrow.

439
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:20,417
You are my strength and my shield.

440
00:29:21,137 --> 00:29:25,137
I ask for wisdom and courage
in this darkest of moments.

441
00:29:26,817 --> 00:29:28,817
In the name of Christ the king.

442
00:29:30,777 --> 00:29:32,777
Amen.

443
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:03,737
Why are you so bothered about me?

444
00:31:06,057 --> 00:31:08,057
What's my life got to do with you?

445
00:31:15,577 --> 00:31:17,577
I think you should leave.

446
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:22,777
You're gonna stop asking questions
about me.

447
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:26,617
Why would I do that?

448
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:31,977
I know men who would rape you.

449
00:31:55,977 --> 00:31:57,217
Night.

450
00:31:58,297 --> 00:31:59,897
Night.

451
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:13,584
It's OK. We're getting you to
hospital. No, you can't.

452
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,904
It's gonna be OK. You don't need to
worry.

453
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:27,844
Good morning, sunshine. Took quite a
crack. What am I doing here?

454
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:29,471
How you feeling?
What are you doing here?

455
00:33:29,518 --> 00:33:32,238
You passed out.
Found you on the bathroom floor.

456
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:34,278
What were you doing in my bathroom?

457
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:38,518
The person in the room underneath you
complained about the banging,
luckily.

458
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:42,558
Is this your daughter?
What you doing with that?

459
00:33:42,598 --> 00:33:46,598
I was looking for your next of kin
in the ambulance. I told them I was
your wife.

460
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:49,838
What? Is that bad? I think they
caught on pretty quick.

461
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:55,038
Anyway, look, I am glad you are OK
and awake. I have to get back.

462
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,310
Left Neil in charge, he's not exactly
competent.

463
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,470
Listen. You mustn't tell anyone
about this.

464
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,030
If they find out I'm sick they'll
take me off the case.

465
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:05,270
I don't want to come off this case.
I need to finish this case.

466
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:08,241
Becca.

467
00:34:08,281 --> 00:34:10,281
It's my career.

468
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:13,801
This is my life.
You get some proper medical help.

469
00:34:13,841 --> 00:34:16,121
Cos next time someone might not find
you.

470
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:19,241
I'm coming with you.
Ah, no, they want to keep you in.

471
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:21,281
I don't care. What's this?

472
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:16,841
It's a great piece. You captured Beth
just right. But Maggie's gonna be
miffed.

473
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:20,841
I'll talk to her. Mark and Beth were
desperate for people to know about
the case.

474
00:35:20,881 --> 00:35:23,201
Think about the witnesses
that might come forward.

475
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:25,641
So you're the golden girl
on your news desk now?

476
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:30,441
Well, the boss is officially happy
and the rest of the papers are now
scrambling to catch up.

477
00:35:30,481 --> 00:35:32,801
Half a dozen...
Hang on, I've gotta go.

478
00:35:37,121 --> 00:35:39,841
You've gotta be joking.
Nothing to do with me.

479
00:35:42,321 --> 00:35:44,121
Mum?

480
00:35:44,681 --> 00:35:47,801
Oh, what are you doing with that?
Don't be brave, son.

481
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:50,561
For God's sake. I thought you said
you'd fixed it.

482
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:56,041
It's a mix-up. They got it wrong.
Why don't you understand the trouble
we're in?

483
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,121
Why has she done this?
It reads all right to me.

484
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:01,241
I told 'em not to. I'm gonna have to
go.

485
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:04,641
See you later.

486
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:07,881
I was thinking of taking the kids to
church this morning.

487
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:09,921
Church?
Yeah.

488
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:12,161
Why?
Don't know.

489
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:16,681
Just... felt... the thing...

490
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:20,241
Yeah. OK.

491
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:23,241
Bye-bye.
Ta-ra, love.

492
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:27,001
Bye, Mummy.
Bye. Good boy.

493
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:34,657
Jesus, what happened to you?
I slipped in the shower.

494
00:36:34,697 --> 00:36:38,377
You've been glued up. You look
terrible, sir, if you don't mind me
saying.

495
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:41,337
Have you seen the Herald? Yeah, I
didn't know they'd done that.

496
00:36:41,377 --> 00:36:44,577
It's opened the floodgates. Media
officer's been deluged with calls.

497
00:36:44,617 --> 00:36:47,257
So I'm calling a conference for this
evening.

498
00:36:47,297 --> 00:36:50,537
A family statement - try and keep as
much control as we can.

499
00:36:50,577 --> 00:36:55,377
Meantime, I want full backgrounds on
Jack Marshall, Steve Connelly and
Paul Coates.

500
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:57,537
Anyone without an alibi goes top of
our list.

501
00:36:57,577 --> 00:36:59,297
I'll get Frank and Nish on it.

502
00:36:59,337 --> 00:37:02,337
Sir, can I ask a favour?
I was thinking of going to church.

503
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:05,937
That's a good idea. Everyone all
together, check who's behaving
normally.

504
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:08,937
No, that wasn't the... Never mind.
What time's the service?

505
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,977
In an hour.

506
00:37:12,657 --> 00:37:14,057
All right.

507
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,217
Hey. I've got to tell you before we
go in.

508
00:37:27,777 --> 00:37:30,257
I saw Olly Stevens and Jack Marshall
yesterday.

509
00:37:30,297 --> 00:37:34,217
From what I can make out Olly was
saying... Jack's got a history with
kids.

510
00:37:34,257 --> 00:37:36,577
Bad stuff.
You're kidding?

511
00:37:37,537 --> 00:37:39,537
Beth! Beth!

512
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,617
All right, lads? Just let them go
through.

513
00:37:48,177 --> 00:37:50,777
Away now, or I'll have you all
arrested!

514
00:37:51,177 --> 00:37:54,097
We're not breaking the law.
Have a bit of bloody decency.

515
00:37:54,137 --> 00:37:56,657
Lenses down or I will kick you all in
the balls.

516
00:37:56,697 --> 00:37:59,377
You didn't hear me say that. I
promise you I will.

517
00:37:59,817 --> 00:38:01,817
Your mum is awesome.
I know.

518
00:38:16,257 --> 00:38:17,737
Come for lunch today.
What?

519
00:38:17,777 --> 00:38:19,777
Nige is cooking.

520
00:38:20,497 --> 00:38:22,497
Like we always do.

521
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:25,537
Jack.

522
00:38:33,457 --> 00:38:36,937
Didn't know he was religious.
Didn't know we were.

523
00:38:36,977 --> 00:38:38,977
Fair point.

524
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:48,617
Hello, husband. How's the head?

525
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:58,137
We are pressed on every side by
troubles.

526
00:38:58,177 --> 00:39:00,177
But we are not crushed.

527
00:39:00,857 --> 00:39:04,337
We are perplexed but not driven to
despair.

528
00:39:05,537 --> 00:39:09,817
We are hunted down,
but never abandoned by God.

529
00:39:11,097 --> 00:39:13,097
We are knocked down...

530
00:39:15,217 --> 00:39:17,217
but we are not destroyed.

531
00:39:19,017 --> 00:39:23,857
As a community, the hardest thing for
us is to remember,

532
00:39:23,897 --> 00:39:25,897
we have not been abandoned by God.

533
00:39:29,017 --> 00:39:31,017
We are not destroyed.

534
00:39:33,697 --> 00:39:35,697
Nor will we be.

535
00:39:44,777 --> 00:39:47,057
No? All right, I'll have it.
I want it.

536
00:39:51,777 --> 00:39:54,497
Quite a spread, Nige. You've got
hidden talents.

537
00:39:56,537 --> 00:39:59,257
You'll make someone a lovely husband
one day.

538
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:01,297
They'll have to catch me first, Liz.

539
00:40:06,097 --> 00:40:10,977
I think one of those photographers
got in while we were out. I'll get a
lock first thing.

540
00:40:11,017 --> 00:40:14,057
You all right? You've been quiet.
What do you expect?

541
00:40:16,537 --> 00:40:18,297
Yeah.

542
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:22,857
We should go in, get something to
eat. Get ready for this press
conference.

543
00:40:26,577 --> 00:40:28,737
Wahey!

544
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:32,017
He's a beauty.

545
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:34,177
Thanks.

546
00:40:36,137 --> 00:40:37,697
All right?
Yeah.

547
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:47,057
Nige, there's a hair in it.

548
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,697
You all right, sweetheart?
Yeah.

549
00:41:17,737 --> 00:41:19,337
You OK?

550
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:22,257
Can I ask you something? You can say
no.

551
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:25,217
Can I have a hug?

552
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:29,137
OK.

553
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:33,857
I miss his hugs.

554
00:41:41,817 --> 00:41:43,817
I'd best get that.

555
00:41:50,857 --> 00:41:52,697
You gonna have a cup of coffee?

556
00:41:52,737 --> 00:41:54,737
Jack's here.

557
00:41:57,937 --> 00:42:00,577
Everything all right?
I... found this.

558
00:42:01,497 --> 00:42:05,097
Heard the beeping from the delivery
bags. It was in the bag at the
bottom.

559
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:09,457
He must have left it on his last
round.

560
00:42:09,497 --> 00:42:13,337
Yeah, that's Danny's phone, isn't it?
Mark, I'll take it. Give it here.

561
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:17,017
What were you doing with this, Jack?
Mark.

562
00:42:18,977 --> 00:42:21,577
Mark, Beth...

563
00:42:23,017 --> 00:42:25,697
They're going to say things about me.
What sort of things?

564
00:42:25,737 --> 00:42:28,337
Those things aren't true.
Jack. Come on, love.

565
00:42:28,377 --> 00:42:32,377
Things happened before I was here,
and they'll be saying I did it.

566
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:35,297
I'm looking you in the eye,
because he was your boy,

567
00:42:35,337 --> 00:42:37,737
and I'm telling you I'm not that kind
of man.

568
00:42:38,497 --> 00:42:40,657
Please. Believe me.

569
00:42:42,657 --> 00:42:44,577
You have to believe me.

570
00:42:46,657 --> 00:42:49,177
The bastards!
I'm with you, mate.

571
00:42:49,217 --> 00:42:52,257
Jack, I don't know what you're doing.
Come on, Jack.

572
00:42:52,297 --> 00:42:55,417
Piss off! Go on! Get away, go on!

573
00:42:55,457 --> 00:42:58,257
Public property this!
Is it? Is it?

574
00:42:58,297 --> 00:43:00,057
Out the way, Mark.

575
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:03,937
Bad doggy! Bad doggy!

576
00:43:03,977 --> 00:43:07,457
Terrible weather!
We're going, all right?! Stop it!

577
00:43:10,017 --> 00:43:12,017
What have we done to ourselves, eh?

578
00:43:23,297 --> 00:43:25,297
Why do they need all of us?

579
00:43:27,257 --> 00:43:30,577
So people can understand
how much losing Danny meant to us.

580
00:43:30,617 --> 00:43:32,617
How strong a family we are.

581
00:43:32,657 --> 00:43:34,657
Right, are you ready for this?

582
00:43:34,697 --> 00:43:37,777
Chloe, you go at the far end
and then Beth and then Mark.

583
00:43:42,097 --> 00:43:44,097
I know about you and Becca Fisher.

584
00:43:49,057 --> 00:43:51,057
Mark, now, please.

585
00:43:58,497 --> 00:44:02,417
Sir. SOCO have confirmed the hairs
found on the boat - they match
Danny's.

586
00:44:02,457 --> 00:44:05,217
I knew it. Also, something from North
Yorkshire Police,

587
00:44:05,257 --> 00:44:08,137
about a killing on the cliffs in
Whitby 15 years back.

588
00:44:08,177 --> 00:44:11,377
They've seen the details and think
it's got similarities to our case.

589
00:44:11,417 --> 00:44:15,937
OK, later. Sir, Jack Marshall used to
live in North Yorkshire, five miles
from Whitby.

590
00:44:23,937 --> 00:44:26,337
We miss Danny a lot and erm...

591
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:31,537
we just want whoever's done this
just to come forward because we're...

592
00:44:33,977 --> 00:44:38,257
we're having a horrible time not
knowing why this has happened to us.

593
00:44:38,697 --> 00:44:42,177
He was just a normal lad.
Never did anyone any harm.

594
00:44:42,217 --> 00:44:44,217
He was everything to us.

595
00:44:44,937 --> 00:44:47,217
We just want to know
what happened to our boy.

596
00:44:47,257 --> 00:44:51,617
If anybody out there knows, might
know, think they saw something...

597
00:44:52,617 --> 00:44:56,057
then you owe it to yourself
to come forward and tell the police.

598
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,737
Cos whoever did this needs to be
caught.

599
00:45:22,529 --> 00:45:57,269
