1
00:00:15,054 --> 00:00:18,350
I've instructed
my client to remain silent.

2
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:29,633
He's not gonna talk.

3
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:32,065
That's okay.

4
00:00:32,304 --> 00:00:35,040
I don't have much
faith in words myself.

5
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:39,348
Now, statistically speaking,
the average person tells

6
00:00:39,555 --> 00:00:42,413
three lies per 10 minutes
of conversation.

7
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:45,543
And granted,
it's just regular people.

8
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,951
We haven't studied it in people who are
planning to firebomb a Black Church.

9
00:00:49,076 --> 00:00:50,507
Could skew differently.

10
00:00:50,677 --> 00:00:53,051
We don't have time
for this scientist to talk to the guy.

11
00:00:53,395 --> 00:00:55,136
We went at him
for 4 h and got nothing.

12
00:00:55,412 --> 00:00:56,871
Now, the FBI...

13
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:01,412
knows you want mass casualties,
so right now, the ATF is searching

14
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:05,312
every inch of the 2 largest
Black churches in the state.

15
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:09,317
The FBI got it wrong.
Well, there's a shocker.

16
00:01:10,047 --> 00:01:11,861
Not one of those two churches.

17
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:14,263
Maybe you want...

18
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:18,839
one of the smaller churches,
in one of the Black suburbs.

19
00:01:18,964 --> 00:01:21,490
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Don't respond.

20
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,583
What do you say ATF
starts with Southbridge?

21
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,264
I'm only kidding.

22
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:31,720
We're gonna skip that one.

23
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:33,383
We gotta focus on Lorton.

24
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:36,565
You feel good about that?

25
00:01:38,572 --> 00:01:39,783
That's it, Lorton.

26
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:43,112
- He's going after a church in Lorton.
- That accusation has no basis.

27
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,711
What do you mean?
He just told me.

28
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:52,062
The ATF found a pipe-bomb in a church
basement in Lorton an hour later.

29
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:55,563
A DOD friend of mine said
this guy's a total nutjob.

30
00:01:55,688 --> 00:01:57,797
Heard he spent like three
years in the African jungle

31
00:01:57,922 --> 00:01:59,967
with some primitive tribe,
studying their eyebrows.

32
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:01,621
Watch his reaction to my statement.

33
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,875
Right now,
ATF is searching every inch

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,705
of the 2 largest Black
churches in the State.

35
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:09,303
What you just saw there was
a brief expression of happiness

36
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:11,778
on his face which he was
trying his best to conceal.

37
00:02:11,903 --> 00:02:16,631
Lasted for less than a fifth of a second
as what we call a microexpression.

38
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:18,388
Now, look his mouth.

39
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,601
The suspect is secretly happy about
the locations we are searching,

40
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:24,013
which tells me we have
the wrong locations.

41
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:27,225
Now, I tell him
of our new plan and...

42
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:30,012
You don't know
what you're talking about.

43
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:31,938
Classic one-sided shrug.

44
00:02:32,198 --> 00:02:34,835
Translation: "I've absolutely no
confidence in what I just said."

45
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,717
The body contradicts the words.
He's lying.

46
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:41,925
When you accuse a suspect and he acts
surprised, is there a way to tell

47
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,288
if it's real or if he's
trying to look innocent?

48
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:49,289
That's real surprise.

49
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:52,391
Lasts for less than a second
when it comes across the face,

50
00:02:52,844 --> 00:02:56,833
but if your suspect is surprised
for more than a second, he's faking it.

51
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,494
He's lying.

52
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:02,719
Now, I call out that his target
is actually Lorton.

53
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:04,095
And...

54
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:05,555
watch it again.

55
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:08,266
Concealed scorn.

56
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:12,127
One personal tip.
If you see this microexpression

57
00:03:12,252 --> 00:03:15,732
in your spouse's face, your marriage
is coming to an end. Trust me.

58
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:21,283
Don't these micro-expressions
vary depending on the person?

59
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,723
Let's leave this up,
and we'll go to the Kato Kaelin footage

60
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:26,688
from the O.J. trial.

61
00:03:26,813 --> 00:03:29,139
Mr. Kaelin, you've got a lot
of money for your appearance

62
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:31,380
on a current affair, didn't you?

63
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:32,958
Scorn!

64
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,261
Huge scorn.

65
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,428
Shame,

66
00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:42,778
shame and shame.

67
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:44,431
Contempt,

68
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:46,975
these expressions are universal.

69
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:50,390
Emotion looks the same,
whether you are a suburban housewife,

70
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:52,196
or a suicide bomber.

71
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:54,709
The truth is written
on all our faces.

72
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,873
Subtitle:
www.sub-way.fr (1.00)

73
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:14,036
Just the man I was looking for.

74
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:16,513
- Today's the day. Say it.
- You're the shrink.

75
00:04:16,638 --> 00:04:19,008
- I'm not big on self-affirmation.
- I'm telling you,

76
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,009
we cannot wait another
day to hire someone.

77
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:24,527
I found the one.
This is the one.

78
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:28,858
- Use your words.
- Why do we need to hire someone?

79
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:32,078
We got new requests this morning
from the DEA and Homeland Security,

80
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:34,368
The Prime Minister's
office in Uzbekistan called,

81
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:36,332
they want us to talk
to their senior police.

82
00:04:36,457 --> 00:04:38,709
Tell them to call back when they
have a real constitution.

83
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:40,821
The analysis
from the blinking experiment.

84
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,274
- You're just getting in, Loker?
- Yeah.

85
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,524
I got piss drunk
last night with my roommate

86
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:48,068
and I was lying in bed this morning,
thinking about

87
00:04:48,193 --> 00:04:50,748
how nasty hot Nancy Grace is

88
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,099
and just trying to decide
if I was gonna come in at all

89
00:04:53,224 --> 00:04:55,420
'cause there's not
anyone here to fantasize about.

90
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,629
No offense taken.

91
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,763
I don't go for married women.

92
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:03,815
Cal!

93
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:07,339
Dr. Lightman,
I have the mayor on 2 for you.

94
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:08,390
Right.

95
00:05:10,483 --> 00:05:11,517
Mr. Mayor.

96
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:14,977
All right, I see.

97
00:05:16,044 --> 00:05:17,044
Of course.

98
00:05:18,542 --> 00:05:19,542
Any time.

99
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,702
- What is it?
- Some blow-up

100
00:05:22,827 --> 00:05:26,325
with the justice department about that
high school teacher killed in Northwest.

101
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:29,035
He wants us in on it right away...
What is that?

102
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,373
- Chocolate pudding.
- Who eats pudding at 10 in the morning?

103
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,290
People who like pudding.

104
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,902
The Mayor thanks you and Dr. Foster
for coming on short notice.

105
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:47,292
So this case is a land mine.
We've got a juvenile offender.

106
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:49,609
Family of devout
Jehovah's witnesses.

107
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:51,850
We gotta be real careful here.

108
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:53,978
3 days ago, James Cole,

109
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:57,982
16 year-old student at Jackson High
murdered his teacher Susan McCartney.

110
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,211
After Mr. Cole got
into Miss McCartney's house,

111
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:03,744
he smashed her head
into a glass coffee table.

112
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:07,266
He then was caught fleeing
the house by two patrolmen.

113
00:06:08,264 --> 00:06:10,393
He's been in custody
here ever since.

114
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:23,257
So what exactly does the mayor want
to find out about the McCartney murder?

115
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:25,881
Assistant US attorneys
Hutchinson and Estin.

116
00:06:26,006 --> 00:06:28,306
The kid was at the scene of the crime,
he had motive, means

117
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:31,032
- and he resisted arrest.
- And he failed a polygraph test.

118
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,951
- It's murder one.
- Well, I guess we're all here, then.

119
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:36,836
Someone who wants the truth,
someone who wants to be right, and us...

120
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:38,605
the assholes stuck in the middle.

121
00:06:39,394 --> 00:06:41,984
The US attorney's office
wants to try Cole as an adult.

122
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:44,809
But if the mayor is gonna
support sending a 16 year-old

123
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:47,256
to prison for the rest of his life,
he wants to be certain

124
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:49,992
we're talking about
a premeditated cold-blooded murder.

125
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,661
He wants you to provide
an independent assessment of intent.

126
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,265
We'll need the crime scene photos
and the autopsy report.

127
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,167
But I thought you could tell if somebody
was lying just by looking at them.

128
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,933
The question is never
simply if someone is lying,

129
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:02,058
it's why.

130
00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:07,000
Look, I already told
the police everything, okay?

131
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,121
Tell us why you think
you're here, James.

132
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,391
I was out for a run and the police
thought I was running from them.

133
00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:16,685
So they arrested me.

134
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:20,230
I heard you made
your school's track team.

135
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:22,791
I didn't make it.

136
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,958
They don't have tryouts.

137
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:27,321
What was your best race this year?

138
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,655
I don't know.

139
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:36,413
Probably against Jefferson,
last week. Why?

140
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:39,738
I ran hurdles myself.
Hundred and ten meters.

141
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,063
How'd your quads
feel during the race?

142
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,371
Good, I guess.

143
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:52,346
And what about on your run
the night you were arrested?

144
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:56,850
I felt fine.

145
00:07:59,505 --> 00:08:03,027
Your teacher, Miss McCartney,
was found dead in her home.

146
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:06,465
Have you ever been
to her house before?

147
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,862
No, I've never been
to her house before.

148
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,702
Miss McCartney thought
that you should be held back a year

149
00:08:11,827 --> 00:08:14,660
because she felt you were having
some problems with your classmates.

150
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,914
And what?
I didn't want to get held back.

151
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:22,084
How did you feel
when you find out she was dead?

152
00:08:25,225 --> 00:08:26,907
I prayed for her soul.

153
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:30,799
I can't know God's plan.

154
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:33,296
But I didn't kill her.

155
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:53,296
Hurdles?

156
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,231
I could've run hurdles.

157
00:08:56,356 --> 00:08:57,356
Please.

158
00:08:58,968 --> 00:09:00,664
So you get a sense of his intent?

159
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,709
When I asked James about his best race,
he broke eye contact.

160
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:07,420
In order to remember and answer
truthfully. When I asked him about

161
00:09:07,545 --> 00:09:09,819
his run the night of the murder
he never broke eye contact.

162
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:11,383
He wasn't recalling a memory.

163
00:09:12,189 --> 00:09:14,635
- He was lying.
- But I thought most people avoid

164
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,679
- eye contact when they are lying.
- No, it's a myth.

165
00:09:17,804 --> 00:09:20,183
And quite often,
they make more eye contact.

166
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:23,108
They need to watch to see
if you believe their lies.

167
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:25,130
The countent analysis
would suggest that James

168
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:27,010
has been to Miss McCartney's
house before.

169
00:09:27,135 --> 00:09:31,236
"Have you ever been to her house?"
"No, I have never been to her house."

170
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:33,253
Rigid repetition like
that is typical of a lie.

171
00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:36,328
Okay, so you'll tell the mayor's office
the murder was premeditated?

172
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:37,767
It looks that way.

173
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,412
But, when I asked him
about his teacher's death,

174
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:42,439
what we saw is this:

175
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,458
Oblique eyebrows.

176
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:45,822
Sadness.

177
00:09:46,788 --> 00:09:48,587
Why would he be hiding
sadness for her?

178
00:09:49,146 --> 00:09:50,951
- Looks like guilt to me.
- No.

179
00:09:51,076 --> 00:09:53,008
It's possible he didn't
mean to kill his teacher.

180
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:55,969
- Excuse me?
- Could have been an accident.

181
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,799
Okay.

182
00:09:58,373 --> 00:10:00,906
I indulged the mayor's office
on letting you talk to the kid,

183
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:02,953
but now, you're just making...

184
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:05,899
wild guesses that have
no basis in hard evidence.

185
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:07,571
This was no accident.

186
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,358
And personally I think
what you do is a joke,

187
00:10:10,598 --> 00:10:12,110
it's a freaking carnival act.

188
00:10:12,382 --> 00:10:14,115
I get that a lot.

189
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:17,174
You know, a moment ago,

190
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,668
I saw you smile at your colleague,

191
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,079
flash her a glance,
then shift your gaze.

192
00:10:22,495 --> 00:10:26,124
She responded by raising her chin bow,
revealing deep embarrassment...

193
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,462
I'll take another "wild guess":
you two...

194
00:10:30,877 --> 00:10:33,966
had a fling, but she doesn't want
to repeat performance because,

195
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:36,372
what with your wife and all,

196
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:40,889
but you won't move on.
Keep your fingers off your nose,

197
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,766
men have erectile tissue there...

198
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:45,275
itches when they're
hiding something.

199
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,374
I've been principal here
for over three years.

200
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:03,340
We've never faced
anything like this.

201
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:05,452
To lose a teacher
and then to find out

202
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:07,901
that a student might have
been responsible, it's...

203
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:09,911
I understand James
was new to the school.

204
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,816
Yes, his parents chose
to home-school him

205
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:14,339
until this year 'cause
they are devout Jehovah's Witnesses.

206
00:11:14,865 --> 00:11:18,260
He was prepared academically
but he had real difficulties socially.

207
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,093
Did he ever express emotion
of any kind towards Miss McCartney?

208
00:11:21,218 --> 00:11:25,129
He was sent to me a number of times,
but he never mentioned her specifically.

209
00:11:25,254 --> 00:11:26,458
But I can tell you,

210
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:29,730
the boy's father had some strong
objections to Miss McCartney's teaching.

211
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:30,757
He was...

212
00:11:30,882 --> 00:11:34,036
outraged that she had assigned the book
The Color Purple to her students.

213
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,629
He thought it was pornographic.

214
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:41,446
All right, they are ready for you.
But can I just say,

215
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:43,910
as much as we all mourn this loss,

216
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:48,081
no teacher believes that
this boy should go to prison for life.

217
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,585
He was in the photography club
for like five minutes before he quit.

218
00:11:52,398 --> 00:11:56,161
Seemed like he didn't talk, ever.
He took really good photos, though.

219
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:58,467
I never saw him hang out
with anybody,

220
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,935
he's kind of intense,
like the way he stares at you.

221
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,515
He talked a bunch of crap
about Miss McCartney.

222
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,018
Really? Well, what did he say?

223
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,753
Kid's a freak, I mean,

224
00:12:10,135 --> 00:12:12,253
I can't remember exactly, but...

225
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,317
I'm sure I heard him say
something psycho about her.

226
00:12:15,672 --> 00:12:17,456
You wouldn't just be
saying that because

227
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:20,197
you got suspended
for hitting him in the face?

228
00:12:23,498 --> 00:12:25,134
I was in bio lab with him.

229
00:12:27,177 --> 00:12:30,078
I don't see how he could have
done what they are saying he did,

230
00:12:30,203 --> 00:12:31,279
it's just...

231
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,502
I don't believe it.

232
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,651
I mean,
I've never even seen him get angry.

233
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,669
And why would he want
to kill her anyway?

234
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:50,185
Are you feeling emotional in
any way right now, Jacquelin?

235
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,444
- It's okay if you are.
- I feel fine.

236
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:08,578
Deputy Bonds.

237
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,706
And what did you
learn at school today?

238
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,152
Fifty-seven classmates
and not one credible account

239
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:14,986
of antecedent aggression from James.

240
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:18,004
I need to see the case file and look at
the other suspects Homicide questioned.

241
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,631
You don't think he is guilty?

242
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,634
I don't know, but if the prosecutor
wants to send a kid my daughter's age

243
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,137
to a cell block with
pedophiles and serial killers,

244
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,931
- I wouldn't mind knowing for sure.
- Whatever you need.

245
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:37,062
All right.

246
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:39,638
Forget it, we'll find another one.

247
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,805
Maybe he didn't see me,
why don't you get out?

248
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,915
You didn't see
me waiting for that space?

249
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,552
- Didn't see ya.
- Really?

250
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,443
No, I did not see you.

251
00:14:08,568 --> 00:14:11,183
I was waiting too,
you must not have seen me.

252
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,521
That's fantastic!
Classic gestural slip.

253
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,230
You gave the slightest head nod yes
before he shook your head no.

254
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,084
Look, I'm in the space.

255
00:14:20,744 --> 00:14:23,319
- And I'm not going anywhere.
- That's true.

256
00:14:29,046 --> 00:14:31,266
You can't block me in like that.

257
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,745
Sir!

258
00:14:33,193 --> 00:14:37,918
Congratulations, one liar down,
six and a half billion to go.

259
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,181
The US Attorney's office
scheduled the transfer hearing,

260
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,976
we have two days. I told
the mayor's office we need to examine

261
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,561
James' antecedent behavior
so we are set to meet his parents

262
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,807
- and his church group.
- How you doing today, sir?

263
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,274
- I'm great.
- Good. Could you step out of the line?

264
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:03,716
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

265
00:15:08,752 --> 00:15:10,764
Any reason you might be
anxious this morning, sir?

266
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:12,681
I'm worried I'll miss my flight.

267
00:15:12,806 --> 00:15:14,976
I need you to open
the briefcase for me.

268
00:15:15,101 --> 00:15:17,247
You know what? I'm gonna check it.
It's the liquids.

269
00:15:17,372 --> 00:15:19,501
Stop.
T-3B Backup. Backup T-3B.

270
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,994
Open your briefcase.

271
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,013
You're gonna need to come with us.

272
00:15:34,262 --> 00:15:36,726
Actually, you need to come with us.

273
00:15:40,654 --> 00:15:43,483
When you crossed the line, I could tell
you were jacked up about something.

274
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,444
Because I flashed you
a partial fear expression.

275
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:49,648
Whatever.
But, why were you trying to play me?

276
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:52,756
Six years ago, Dr. Lightman

277
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:55,602
left the Deception Detection Program
he founded for the Defense Department.

278
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:58,605
Together, we started a private firm
works with police, corporations

279
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,685
and almost every Federal agency.

280
00:16:01,213 --> 00:16:04,169
- We'd like you to come work for us.
- Why?

281
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:07,273
You've made seven times
more arrest than the average TSA agent.

282
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:10,570
And you scored 97 percent
on the TSA Deception Diagnostic,

283
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:12,053
which Dr. Lightman created.

284
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,431
Have you ever had
any specialized deception training?

285
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,057
I've dated a lot of men.

286
00:16:18,497 --> 00:16:19,873
You're one of the naturals.

287
00:16:19,998 --> 00:16:23,523
There's an infinitesimal percentage
of the population, less than.001,

288
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,234
that test nearly perfect
without any advanced training.

289
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:29,362
We've already cleared your leaving
with the TSA field director.

290
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:31,871
Our office will call you later.

291
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:39,711
- Don't forget your briefcase.
- That's your signing bonus.

292
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,758
I just had a long conversation
with the school guidance counselor.

293
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,685
The girl whose breathing you said was
fast and shallow, Jacquelin Mathis,

294
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,924
has had 3 appointments with
the school nurse in the past 2 weeks.

295
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,702
The guidance guy said typically,
that could be about drugs or an STD.

296
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:02,760
You know? Gonorrhea,

297
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:04,774
clap, crabs.

298
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:08,851
Find out if Jacquelin had any connection
with James Cole outside of school.

299
00:17:08,976 --> 00:17:10,704
And follow up with the nurse.

300
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,352
Did the school principal
seem tense to you?

301
00:17:14,477 --> 00:17:16,159
Wouldn't you be at his place?

302
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,454
He had his left hand in his pants pocket
pressed against his leg the whole time.

303
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:21,539
We're not all hiding something.

304
00:17:23,302 --> 00:17:26,127
You think I'm naive, because I don't
share your twisted view of the world.

305
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,827
- That and you read romance novel.
- Yes I do.

306
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:31,097
Because they make me happy.

307
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:33,301
A pursuit I highly recommend to you.

308
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:35,708
Truth or happiness.
Never both.

309
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,473
What is that, now?

310
00:17:39,694 --> 00:17:42,268
- Orange slushy.
- How old are you?

311
00:17:43,373 --> 00:17:46,626
Chairman Baldridge from the Democratic
National Committee's on the phone.

312
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,693
- Some sort of crisis.
- Politician, that's for you.

313
00:17:51,846 --> 00:17:54,948
Charge him by the lie
and we can retire tomorrow.

314
00:17:55,415 --> 00:17:58,601
- Why isn't Dr. Lightman here?
- Cal really wanted to make it.

315
00:17:58,726 --> 00:18:00,805
He's a better liar than you are.

316
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,499
- He's a better liar than all of us.
- I need your help, Gillian.

317
00:18:04,973 --> 00:18:09,187
Congressman Zeb Weil,
whose career I spent 20 years building,

318
00:18:09,312 --> 00:18:11,256
is about to be accused
of paying for sex.

319
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:14,254
A friend at The Post gave me
the tip but I need to know

320
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:17,429
- the truth before the story breaks.
- You think it could be a smear job?

321
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,417
I do.
But allegedly,

322
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:22,080
Congressman Weil frequents
some sort of high priced

323
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:24,602
escort service
at an underground club in Georgetown.

324
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,151
Now, if that's true,

325
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,274
it's gonna be a PR nightmare.

326
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:32,235
Because he's the new chairman
of the House Ethics Comittee.

327
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:33,834
That's delightful,

328
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,947
but we don't go through
people's dirty laundry.

329
00:18:36,923 --> 00:18:40,160
Dr. Lightman just assumes
you're a liar if you're a politician.

330
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,037
He assumes you're a liar
if you're a homo sapien.

331
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,084
If these allegations are false

332
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:49,044
are you gonna stand by while
an innocent man is destroyed by lies?

333
00:18:57,992 --> 00:19:00,055
- Thanks for coming in right away.
- You're the boss.

334
00:19:00,425 --> 00:19:01,969
I would like to sleep with you.

335
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:06,186
Will Loker, Ria Torres.
He's harmless,

336
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,768
he just always speaks
the truth about what's on his mind.

337
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:10,815
- What do you call it again?
- Radical Honesty.

338
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,861
That's it. He'll get you started
on learning our facial coding system.

339
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,861
I have no chance with you.

340
00:19:18,715 --> 00:19:20,325
Do I have any chance with you?

341
00:19:20,636 --> 00:19:23,036
- You always tell the truth?
- Always.

342
00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:24,662
How good are you in bed?

343
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,538
Fair.

344
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:28,747
Fair's better than most.

345
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,498
I don't see why you need
to look at James' bedroom.

346
00:19:35,623 --> 00:19:39,521
Mr. Cole, anything that gets us
a better sense of your son is helpful.

347
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:43,967
- James took these?
- Yes, he did.

348
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:54,627
We let him convert that bathroom
to a dark room for his photography.

349
00:19:55,987 --> 00:19:57,313
Is that a problem?

350
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,936
It was taking too much time
from his responsibilities

351
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:01,908
as a Witness doing God's work.

352
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:06,162
What did James tell you
about Miss McCartney?

353
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:09,103
He thought she was a good teacher.

354
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,084
And did you?

355
00:20:13,437 --> 00:20:15,171
James did not kill that woman.

356
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:18,967
He would not take part
in wrestling practice for gym class.

357
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:22,262
Because he knows the Lord
condemns violence, even in sport.

358
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,807
If you value something, you build
a fence around it to protect it.

359
00:20:26,422 --> 00:20:30,192
That's what we did with James.
We home-schooled him as long as we could

360
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:33,231
to shield him from drugs
and sex and corruption.

361
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,234
Is that why you were angry
about the material she was teaching him?

362
00:20:37,388 --> 00:20:39,547
We are in the world
but not of the world.

363
00:20:39,957 --> 00:20:42,240
And we need to protect
our children from non-believers.

364
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,609
Is there anything you wouldn't do
to protect your son from a non-believer?

365
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:49,289
Watch yourself.
I'm a man of God.

366
00:20:50,221 --> 00:20:52,754
And I like horse racing.
Manhattans.

367
00:20:53,605 --> 00:20:55,353
Briefs, not boxers.

368
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,466
All of which makes us equally likely
to lie, so... I ask you again.

369
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:02,814
Get out of this house.

370
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,861
I've been doing some research
into James' family.

371
00:21:14,986 --> 00:21:17,446
I spoke to an Overseer of their church
who said Mr. Cole

372
00:21:17,571 --> 00:21:20,653
has had fights with other churchgoers
over their "unholy lifestyles."

373
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:22,697
Some of them said he's an extremist.

374
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:25,491
There's something
going on in that family.

375
00:21:25,793 --> 00:21:28,586
The police saw James running away from
the front door of Miss McCartney's house

376
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:31,789
after the murder. Maybe he was trying
to stop his father from killing her.

377
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,791
What was your content
analysis of the mother?

378
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,237
She was definitely concealing something.
When I asked her about Miss McCartney,

379
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,465
she stopped using contractions and
began referring to her as "that woman."

380
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,052
As in "I did not have sex relations
with that woman Ms. Lewinsky."

381
00:21:44,415 --> 00:21:47,931
Distancing language. She knew something
about her she didn't want to say.

382
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,720
We need to look James' poligraph test,
to see what questions he spiked on.

383
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:54,812
Have I mentioned that your office looks
like it belongs to a serial killer?

384
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,940
Several times.

385
00:21:57,574 --> 00:22:00,088
PD is running background checks
on both of parents and trying

386
00:22:00,213 --> 00:22:02,115
to confirm their alibi
the night of the murder.

387
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,893
As for the girl who was so anxious,

388
00:22:05,018 --> 00:22:07,659
no connection
to James Cole outside of school, but...

389
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,723
I do know why she might
have been anxious.

390
00:22:09,848 --> 00:22:12,294
The school nurse insinuated
that Jacqueline is pregnant.

391
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:13,974
Pregnant?

392
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,126
Not what the father in
my shoes wants to hear. I gotta go.

393
00:22:18,219 --> 00:22:20,368
I have Emily
and her boyfriend's coming over.

394
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:24,229
You worry too much. You do. You worry.
You're a worrier. You don't even know

395
00:22:24,354 --> 00:22:27,037
- if they talked about having sex.
- He's taking her to a fancy restaurant.

396
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:28,986
Emily's a smart girl,
you have to trust her.

397
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:31,950
Her mother's a smart girl too
and I trusted her.

398
00:22:33,744 --> 00:22:36,829
I think Roger's a loser
but if Mom wants to date a loser...

399
00:22:36,954 --> 00:22:38,523
You don't have to say that for me.

400
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,817
I'm saying it because he's a loser.

401
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,220
I have the utmost respect for anyone

402
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:45,113
your mother cares
about and so should you.

403
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,534
Admit it,
you're thinking "what a loser."

404
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,450
I saw your eyes do the thing.

405
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:53,550
- Dan's early.
- About that...

406
00:22:54,189 --> 00:22:57,391
I know your mom's out of town
tonight and you have the keys.

407
00:22:57,516 --> 00:23:00,336
- And Dan has a car.
- We're not talking about this.

408
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,686
Can you please let him in
while I finish getting ready?

409
00:23:02,811 --> 00:23:05,874
And you better not use some
covert scientific technique

410
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:09,220
to find out what Dan and I
are doing or not doing tonight.

411
00:23:09,842 --> 00:23:10,842
Promise.

412
00:23:12,786 --> 00:23:14,225
No covert science.

413
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,311
Promise.

414
00:23:19,468 --> 00:23:21,399
- Hi, Dan.
- Hi, Dr. Lightman.

415
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:25,012
Are you gonna try
to have sex with my daughter tonight?

416
00:23:31,283 --> 00:23:32,986
We appreciate your time.

417
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,039
Congressman Weil, have you ever
been to a club called Centurion?

418
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:40,979
Marshall, what is this really about?

419
00:23:41,104 --> 00:23:43,915
I'm a five-term US Congressman,
I'd appreciate if...

420
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,772
Answer the question, Zeb.

421
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:49,510
I've never heard of it. Why?

422
00:23:50,154 --> 00:23:52,930
It's been alleged that you go
to this club on Friday nights.

423
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:56,184
Tell me how you spent
last Friday evening.

424
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,736
I went for a swim
at the Congressional gym,

425
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:02,774
then I went home to catch up
on some committee reading.

426
00:24:03,626 --> 00:24:04,626
Go on.

427
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:09,072
I had dinner alone before leaving
for an event at the Smithsonian.

428
00:24:09,354 --> 00:24:11,407
Got it.
Now just tell it to me backwards.

429
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,407
What?

430
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,911
Start at the end of the night
and work backwards.

431
00:24:18,794 --> 00:24:22,265
Before the event
at the Smithsonian, I...

432
00:24:23,697 --> 00:24:27,423
Well, as I told you,
I did some reading and...

433
00:24:30,072 --> 00:24:32,137
Before that, I...

434
00:24:33,112 --> 00:24:34,806
That guy's lying his ass off.

435
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:36,249
Yes, he is.

436
00:24:36,882 --> 00:24:40,311
When lying, it's hard to tell
a story backwards: there's no memory.

437
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,123
Liars repeat their stories in order,

438
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:44,296
they don't think
to rehearse them backwards.

439
00:24:44,569 --> 00:24:47,321
Have you ever engaged
the services of a prostitute?

440
00:24:47,645 --> 00:24:50,029
I am certainly not going
to dignify that...

441
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:55,710
And that is an expression of deep shame.
Is this guy religious?

442
00:24:55,835 --> 00:24:58,763
That's what I don't understand.
Not religious, not married, no kids.

443
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:01,667
But he shows deeper shame than
politicans cheating on their wives.

444
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:05,002
Being the Ethics Chairman takes a lot
of the fun out of sex with hookers.

445
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,176
But seriously, what if he's into
something a lot more shameful?

446
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:10,299
Smacking them around
or underage girls.

447
00:25:13,526 --> 00:25:17,390
I need to restore the expression
I had from James's polygraph up here.

448
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,990
Did you attack Susan McCartney?

449
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:31,988
The same shame expression.

450
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:35,341
Now punch in on his eye,
I want to see his pupil.

451
00:25:37,444 --> 00:25:39,025
They're fully dilated.

452
00:25:39,856 --> 00:25:43,583
And it's not fear or anger.
You know what else makes pupils dilate?

453
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:44,750
Sexual arousal.

454
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,130
You think James and Ms. McCartney
had a sexual relationship.

455
00:25:49,627 --> 00:25:51,836
Maybe that's
what the parents were hiding.

456
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,721
My son did not engage
in sexual activity of any kind.

457
00:25:57,546 --> 00:25:58,631
As I told you,

458
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:01,225
we're here
because we believe your son is innocent.

459
00:26:01,997 --> 00:26:05,007
There is no sign of rape
or sexual assault on this crime.

460
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:06,606
But on his polygraph,

461
00:26:06,968 --> 00:26:10,026
James exhibited intense
sexual feelings for Ms. McCartney.

462
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:12,674
- Gerald...
- Be quiet!

463
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,182
We saw you try to conceal
your scorn for Ms. McCartney.

464
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:18,367
That's not just about
the book she's teaching, is it?

465
00:26:20,348 --> 00:26:22,121
What can you tell us
about the son and her?

466
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,165
I've already told everything.

467
00:26:24,508 --> 00:26:27,234
Both of you and your son are lying.

468
00:26:27,928 --> 00:26:30,755
Now let me tell you something,
the only way 3 people can keep a secret

469
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,341
is if 2 of them are dead.
So why don't you wake the hell up?

470
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,426
Everything you're doing
makes perfect sense.

471
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:40,155
You're afraid
for your son, Ms. Cole.

472
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:44,037
And when we experience fear,
we try to exercise whatever control

473
00:26:44,162 --> 00:26:46,753
we can,
even if it makes things worse.

474
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,217
That's why you lied to us before.

475
00:26:50,006 --> 00:26:51,820
It may help you feel better,

476
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:53,847
but it's not helping your son.

477
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:57,969
Because right now the only people
who believe James is innocent

478
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,283
are in this room.

479
00:27:03,156 --> 00:27:07,333
I know that you have the courage
to move past your fear

480
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,127
and tell us the truth.

481
00:27:15,562 --> 00:27:16,634
Wait here.

482
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:30,106
We found these hidden in James' room

483
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:34,395
before the police came
and searched his things.

484
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:47,284
I know how this must look but...

485
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:49,834
our son couldn't possibly
have done this.

486
00:27:54,197 --> 00:27:58,342
Did you know James had been spying
on Ms. McCartney before you found these?

487
00:27:59,963 --> 00:28:02,503
Did you ever talk
to James about sex?

488
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,287
I've talked to him about
the urges young men feel.

489
00:28:06,412 --> 00:28:08,831
We read from Colossians together.

490
00:28:09,602 --> 00:28:12,977
“Fornication, uncleanness,
sexual appetite is idolatry.”

491
00:28:13,102 --> 00:28:15,026
He knows there's no greater sin.

492
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:25,244
I need to see
the crime scene photos.

493
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,797
You can't show
these photographs to anyone, please.

494
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:39,550
We need to show them to your son.

495
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:45,158
You took these.

496
00:28:48,341 --> 00:28:49,341
And...

497
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:53,130
I understand why.

498
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,980
Ms. McCartney didn't
make you feel anger,

499
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,739
she made you feel temptation.

500
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:05,258
She was a beautiful woman

501
00:29:05,714 --> 00:29:08,704
and for the first time
of your life you felt desire.

502
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:13,845
You took these pictures
so you could fantasize about her.

503
00:29:16,743 --> 00:29:17,954
You spied on her.

504
00:29:18,775 --> 00:29:20,589
For weeks. At school...

505
00:29:21,035 --> 00:29:22,156
at her home.

506
00:29:23,048 --> 00:29:25,267
You took these, hiding right here,

507
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:28,455
behind these trees
looking through the bay window.

508
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,050
And on the night of murder
you went back to her house

509
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:32,269
to spy on her.

510
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:36,364
And this is what you saw.

511
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,277
There she was.

512
00:29:40,675 --> 00:29:42,084
You became aroused.

513
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:46,367
You gave in to temptation.

514
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:07,693
I didn't know she was dead.

515
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:12,342
And...

516
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,775
I started to have thoughts.

517
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,566
Unclean thoughts.

518
00:30:21,642 --> 00:30:23,324
And I touched myself.

519
00:30:30,957 --> 00:30:35,518
I swear to God,
I did not know that she was...

520
00:30:36,674 --> 00:30:37,877
that she was dead.

521
00:30:39,802 --> 00:30:41,727
It wasn't until afterwards.

522
00:30:43,856 --> 00:30:46,060
I was walking away and...

523
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:48,606
I saw the blood.

524
00:30:50,177 --> 00:30:51,932
I ran around to the front.

525
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,125
And I was gonna call 911.

526
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,054
But, the police came and...

527
00:30:59,027 --> 00:31:00,027
I ran.

528
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:02,005
I just ran.

529
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:05,673
What was I supposed to do?

530
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,620
I told the truth! I didn't kill her!

531
00:31:12,962 --> 00:31:14,580
I told them what I did!

532
00:31:17,229 --> 00:31:18,167
What was that?

533
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:21,253
You spoon-fed him a good defense
and he's not stupid, he went with it.

534
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,981
But there is still a preponderance
of evidence against him.

535
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:27,927
- More than enough for a Grand Jury.
- James was telling the truth.

536
00:31:28,198 --> 00:31:30,864
He lied when he said he'd never
been to Ms McCartney's house before.

537
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,432
And these photographs go a long
way toward proving premeditation.

538
00:31:33,751 --> 00:31:35,809
You aren't going
to reconsider other suspects?

539
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,125
He was stalking the victim,
fled the scene, and failed a polygraph

540
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,458
- the night of the murder.
- All for the same reason. Sexual guilt.

541
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,130
Polygraph only tells you
if someone is feeling guilty,

542
00:31:45,255 --> 00:31:48,110
and not what they're feeling guilty
about. The guilt James felt had

543
00:31:48,235 --> 00:31:52,080
- nothing to do with the murder.
- you wanna ignore the evidence, fine.

544
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:55,746
I heard how things ended
for you over at the Pentagon.

545
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,541
And, unless you want
the entire Justice Department

546
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,332
picking apart every case
you worked for us too,

547
00:32:01,457 --> 00:32:03,516
you'll leave this one alone.

548
00:32:11,569 --> 00:32:12,664
There she is.

549
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:14,974
Hey, honey.

550
00:32:17,164 --> 00:32:18,978
Hey, Cal. I'm sorry I'm late,

551
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,679
There was a bunch of work
I had to finish before leaving.

552
00:32:21,922 --> 00:32:24,878
Why don't you come to dinner with us?
Clear your head for an hour.

553
00:32:25,003 --> 00:32:27,319
- It's gonna be a late night.
- I'm good. You go ahead.

554
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,570
Good night.

555
00:32:37,064 --> 00:32:39,026
Her husband just lied to her.

556
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,761
He was lying when he said
he got held up with work.

557
00:32:43,886 --> 00:32:45,212
Don't you have work to do?

558
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:49,133
You're not gonna
tell her he's lying?

559
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:53,190
How are we doing on the Congressman
and the sex club thing?

560
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,371
Congressman Weil still
won't admit anything,

561
00:32:58,496 --> 00:33:00,280
so I'm gonna go
at the club tonight and see

562
00:33:00,405 --> 00:33:02,646
if I can find out what he did
that he's so ashamed of.

563
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,760
The girl Weil's been
seeing goes by Melissa

564
00:33:04,885 --> 00:33:07,172
and he sees her every Friday
night without fail.

565
00:33:07,297 --> 00:33:08,297
Classy.

566
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,654
We all pay for sex,
one way or another.

567
00:33:11,203 --> 00:33:13,324
At least hookers
are honest about the price.

568
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:29,632
I bet your boyfriend's pretty
happy this is his birthday present.

569
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:32,134
So how do you like this place,
Melissa?

570
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,727
It's great. Always a party.

571
00:33:35,437 --> 00:33:36,789
You really hate it.

572
00:33:40,022 --> 00:33:41,462
It's just for now.

573
00:33:43,382 --> 00:33:44,578
It sucks being broke,

574
00:33:44,703 --> 00:33:47,088
and I can make a lot more
money here than I did dancing.

575
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:50,402
So are most of your clients
regulars or one-offs?

576
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,887
Mostly regulars actually.

577
00:33:55,653 --> 00:33:58,577
Maybe Julian and I could...
That's my boyfriend.

578
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:02,856
Maybe we'll become one of your regulars.
Are you free next Friday night?

579
00:34:02,981 --> 00:34:04,066
Not Fridays.

580
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:05,191
I...

581
00:34:05,698 --> 00:34:06,698
I have...

582
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:08,379
I have a regular on Fridays.

583
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:14,218
I don't think the Congressman
was doing anything nasty to her.

584
00:34:14,624 --> 00:34:17,679
She had this little smile about
her Friday nights with him.

585
00:34:18,211 --> 00:34:20,048
Like she has feeling for the guy.

586
00:34:20,173 --> 00:34:22,226
Was there wrinkling around
her eyes when she smiled?

587
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,211
- Yeah, there was.
- Then it was real.

588
00:34:26,336 --> 00:34:28,232
In a fake smile,
there's no eye wrinkling.

589
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,424
Excuse me.

590
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,110
Turn on the news.

591
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:38,567
There's much to be learned still.
But House Ethics Chairman Zeb Weil

592
00:34:38,692 --> 00:34:41,857
reportedly spent more
than eighty-two thousand dollars

593
00:34:41,982 --> 00:34:44,522
on a single escort over
a matter of months.

594
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:47,380
He exited his Congressional
offices moments ago...

595
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:53,504
Look at his disgust.

596
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:55,968
Yeah, but he's not
disgusted with himself.

597
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:59,776
It's like he's disgusted with
the idea of having sex with her.

598
00:35:00,287 --> 00:35:02,182
Maybe they weren't having sex.

599
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:07,604
Why would a guy spend $1.800
on an escort he's not having sex with?

600
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,595
Yes, of course.

601
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,146
No, I understand.

602
00:35:13,629 --> 00:35:16,425
The defense attorney says James
***** psychological collapse.

603
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,818
He won't eat,
sleep or talk to anyone.

604
00:35:18,943 --> 00:35:20,451
He's on suicide watch.

605
00:35:22,129 --> 00:35:24,789
Take a look at these.
Her clothes are identical

606
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,332
to the crime scene photos.
James took those the day of the murder.

607
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,680
And you can tell it's late, probably
a couple hours before she was killed.

608
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:34,548
Look at her hand.

609
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,259
What?

610
00:35:48,664 --> 00:35:52,483
It's tensed and turned
upward at her side like this.

611
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,201
Is that a gestural emblem?

612
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:57,738
When we make it consciously,
the meaning's clear.

613
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,449
Stop. She was having an argument.

614
00:36:00,806 --> 00:36:02,370
It had to be pretty disturbing

615
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:04,669
- to produce that emblem.
- So whoever was in that car

616
00:36:04,794 --> 00:36:06,938
had a fight with her just hour
before she was murdered.

617
00:36:07,063 --> 00:36:10,803
Body language tells the truth...
even from the grave.

618
00:36:13,761 --> 00:36:16,808
Principal Castle,
Thank you for seeing us.

619
00:36:16,933 --> 00:36:18,759
Please. Anything to help.

620
00:36:21,703 --> 00:36:24,072
Do you know, who at school,
might have had an argument

621
00:36:24,197 --> 00:36:26,124
with Ms. McCartney
the day she was murdered?

622
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:27,466
I have no idea.

623
00:36:27,591 --> 00:36:29,353
Do you think another
student was involved?

624
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,689
Possibly. We need to know
who drives this car.

625
00:36:38,317 --> 00:36:39,149
Sure.

626
00:36:39,274 --> 00:36:41,323
I can see if it's registered
for school parking.

627
00:36:41,672 --> 00:36:42,866
Is that your car?

628
00:36:44,145 --> 00:36:45,155
No, it's not.

629
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,080
Were you romantically
involved with Ms. McCartney?

630
00:36:48,459 --> 00:36:49,563
Of course not.

631
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:52,006
What are you suggesting?

632
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,067
I'm sorry. I really am.

633
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:58,590
We have to consider everything,
and I'm sorry if I offended you.

634
00:36:59,933 --> 00:37:01,718
Yeah, I'm very sorry.

635
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:04,096
Very sorry, if I offended you...

636
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,647
I am sorry.

637
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,684
I have offended you
and I'm so sorry.

638
00:37:09,052 --> 00:37:10,769
It's not a good thing, really.

639
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:12,118
I apologize.

640
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,576
What's with the Rain Man routine?

641
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:23,363
Want to know how scared he was after
you showed him the photo of the car?

642
00:37:23,488 --> 00:37:25,704
- How scared?
- In skin temperature,

643
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:28,569
about 10° scared.
Which is to say very scared.

644
00:37:29,135 --> 00:37:31,314
His hand was colder
the second time you shook it...

645
00:37:31,439 --> 00:37:33,037
He recognized that car,

646
00:37:33,162 --> 00:37:34,610
and intense fear kicked in.

647
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:36,673
It's a classic
physiological flight response.

648
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:40,451
Blood flows out of the extremities
to the legs so you're ready to run.

649
00:37:40,576 --> 00:37:41,985
Hands get cold fast.

650
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:47,316
The car in question doesn't belong
to the Principal or his wife.

651
00:37:47,441 --> 00:37:48,545
You're sure?

652
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,423
Deputy Bonds had records run
both their registrations.

653
00:37:51,548 --> 00:37:53,770
So Principal Castle
recognized the car, but it's not his.

654
00:37:54,443 --> 00:37:55,710
Find out whose it is.

655
00:37:55,835 --> 00:37:58,629
Have them run the registrations of every
students and teacher of the school.

656
00:37:58,754 --> 00:38:01,641
The DNC Chairman's going ahead
with a press conference this afternoon.

657
00:38:01,766 --> 00:38:04,180
But I know what Congressman Weil
was doing at the sex club

658
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:05,834
and why he was so ashamed.

659
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:08,881
Take a look.
He filed this on-line two years ago.

660
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:12,630
Call me the second
you hear about the car.

661
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:13,755
Come on.

662
00:38:19,902 --> 00:38:22,466
You haven't done enough
muckraking for one day?

663
00:38:22,635 --> 00:38:25,991
Sir, we don't think you were doing
anything sexual at that club...

664
00:38:26,116 --> 00:38:28,315
Because I believe this escort,
"Melissa"

665
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,515
- who you paid for time with...
- What about her?

666
00:38:31,695 --> 00:38:33,041
She's your daughter.

667
00:38:38,087 --> 00:38:41,735
I've already admitted what I did.
I'm tendering my resignation today.

668
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:45,364
This is the profile you registered
in May 2006 on Adopt Connect,

669
00:38:45,771 --> 00:38:48,700
registry for birth parents trying
to reconnect with an adoptee.

670
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,954
The adopted name you listed
was Brenda Melissa Johnson,

671
00:38:52,783 --> 00:38:55,778
The date of birth would
make her Melissa's age now.

672
00:39:06,885 --> 00:39:09,459
I was a junior in college at U.A.

673
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:12,215
and I was seeing a young woman
who was a freshman

674
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,809
at the women's college in Marion.

675
00:39:15,116 --> 00:39:16,321
She got pregnant.

676
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:17,555
We agreed

677
00:39:17,994 --> 00:39:19,717
to a closed adoption.

678
00:39:21,014 --> 00:39:22,433
We both moved on,

679
00:39:23,436 --> 00:39:25,807
but I never stopped
thinking about it.

680
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:30,636
A couple of years ago,
I registered to be found,

681
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:32,238
but nothing came of it.

682
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:36,627
So I hired a private investigator.

683
00:39:37,813 --> 00:39:41,086
Does Melissa, Brenda,
know you're her father?

684
00:39:44,189 --> 00:39:46,257
I didn't want
to force her to confront

685
00:39:46,382 --> 00:39:48,866
an answer she clearly
wasn't looking for.

686
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,510
But when I found out
she was working at that club,

687
00:39:52,635 --> 00:39:54,623
I had to do something. So I went,

688
00:39:55,048 --> 00:39:57,693
started to get to know her,
gave her money,

689
00:39:57,818 --> 00:39:59,354
and tried to get her to quit.

690
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,149
We can tell the Chairman,
and the press.

691
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:03,685
Please, no.

692
00:40:05,327 --> 00:40:06,327
No?

693
00:40:06,797 --> 00:40:09,599
I'm close to getting
Brenda to make a change.

694
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:13,869
If the press finds out
who she really is,

695
00:40:14,778 --> 00:40:17,732
she will spend the rest of her life
being known as

696
00:40:17,857 --> 00:40:20,611
the "Congressman's whore daughter."

697
00:40:25,651 --> 00:40:28,053
I already betrayed her once.

698
00:40:31,043 --> 00:40:32,513
I won't do it again.

699
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:44,324
The car belongs to Jacquelin Mathis

700
00:40:44,574 --> 00:40:46,572
the girl who the school nurse
thought was pregnant.

701
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:49,905
Deputy Bonds had Homicide bring her in:
Second District Station right now.

702
00:40:55,446 --> 00:40:57,461
Why would I know what happened
to Ms. McCartney?

703
00:40:57,586 --> 00:40:59,122
- You tell me.
- Why would I know?

704
00:40:59,566 --> 00:41:01,069
"Why would I know?"

705
00:41:01,851 --> 00:41:03,251
Eyebrows up, like yours,

706
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,629
and the person
knows the answer to the question.

707
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:07,245
But I don't.

708
00:41:08,568 --> 00:41:10,884
- And I don't feel well.
- Morning sickness?

709
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:15,507
You argued with Ms. McCartney
the afternoon she was murdered.

710
00:41:15,632 --> 00:41:17,557
No. You don't know
what you're talking about.

711
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,142
I know when you're lying.

712
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,742
- I'm not lying.
- I know why you fought with her.

713
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:22,687
I didn't.

714
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,653
This is your car?

715
00:41:28,171 --> 00:41:29,569
I didn't kill Ms. McCartney.

716
00:41:30,058 --> 00:41:31,336
That's the truth.

717
00:41:31,596 --> 00:41:32,980
I know you didn't.

718
00:41:33,262 --> 00:41:34,574
But you know who did.

719
00:41:37,231 --> 00:41:39,251
So tell me about the argument.

720
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,624
I don't have anything to say.

721
00:41:45,552 --> 00:41:47,983
You know James Cole is innocent.

722
00:41:49,058 --> 00:41:52,050
He's gonna go to prison for life.
Are you going to help let that happen?

723
00:41:53,526 --> 00:41:56,138
Maybe you couldn't have stopped
the murder but you can stop this.

724
00:41:56,772 --> 00:41:58,014
You have to stop this.

725
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:05,695
I can't...

726
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,336
It doesn't matter anymore.

727
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:33,593
And you'll have to live with this.
'Cause James Cole

728
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,003
just hung himself in his jail cell.

729
00:42:50,057 --> 00:42:52,964
I thought nothing
would really happen to James

730
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:54,869
'cause he's a minor.

731
00:42:56,934 --> 00:42:59,104
I didn't know that he was gonna...

732
00:42:59,474 --> 00:43:00,452
My God.

733
00:43:01,901 --> 00:43:03,690
Why did principal Castle

734
00:43:04,372 --> 00:43:07,667
recognized your car
when I showed him the photograph?

735
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,399
You were involved with him,
weren't you?

736
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,426
Castle took advantage of you.

737
00:43:19,682 --> 00:43:21,747
He didn't take advantage of me.

738
00:43:23,035 --> 00:43:24,458
We were in love...

739
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,061
He loves me.

740
00:43:28,182 --> 00:43:29,564
You're pregnant, aren't you?

741
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:35,424
He was going to leave his wife
to be with me.

742
00:43:35,885 --> 00:43:37,108
He told me...

743
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,068
But Ms. McCartney saw us

744
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:44,477
parked in my car,
just beside school.

745
00:43:44,602 --> 00:43:46,787
We didn't know, but she saw us...

746
00:43:48,211 --> 00:43:50,532
She came up to me later
in the parking lot

747
00:43:50,657 --> 00:43:53,627
freaking out like she had to be
all worried about me when...

748
00:43:53,752 --> 00:43:55,799
I mean, I was the one
who went after him.

749
00:43:56,615 --> 00:43:58,802
And you argued about turning him in?

750
00:43:59,066 --> 00:44:02,389
I begged her not to.
He hadn't done anything wrong.

751
00:44:03,063 --> 00:44:04,602
But she didn't listen.

752
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,702
She said she was going
to turn him in, so...

753
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:11,423
I told him.

754
00:44:12,575 --> 00:44:15,485
He said that everything would be okay,
that he'd talk to her...

755
00:44:18,547 --> 00:44:21,173
I didn't know
that he was going to kill her.

756
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:24,186
I didn't know...

757
00:45:34,703 --> 00:45:37,089
You get the email
from the U.S. attorney's office?

758
00:45:38,532 --> 00:45:40,904
Principal Castle confessed
in exchange for thirty years.

759
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:43,634
I thought the truth'll set you free.

760
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:47,624
Speaking of which,
do you still have that note

761
00:45:47,749 --> 00:45:49,788
I brought you?
I want it for my office.

762
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:52,957
You really are a pack rat.

763
00:45:57,995 --> 00:46:00,006
You couldn't just told me
what this was for?

764
00:46:00,989 --> 00:46:02,634
No, you're a terrible liar.

765
00:46:03,206 --> 00:46:05,053
Normal people
think that's a good thing.

766
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:09,437
- Are you saying I'm not normal?
- Good night.

767
00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:11,184
Go home.

768
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:20,443
What are we going to do
about the Congressman?

769
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,444
Nothing.

770
00:46:22,603 --> 00:46:26,491
So, we're going to let him throw away
his career? We're basically gonna lie?

771
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,243
Not basically.

772
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:32,702
So you lie to your partner
about her husband,

773
00:46:32,827 --> 00:46:35,035
and you lie to the people
who hired us...

774
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,835
what am I supposed
to believe about you?

775
00:46:37,226 --> 00:46:40,463
You believe whatever you want.
It's what everyone else does.

776
00:46:43,712 --> 00:46:46,219
I'm glad we're spending the holidays
with your family.

777
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:48,208
Your folks are great.

778
00:46:53,453 --> 00:46:57,383
I'm saying I didn't want this promotion.
I feel terrible they fired her.

779
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:05,906
I love you. I'm gonna leave my wife,
I just need a little more time.

780
00:47:21,061 --> 00:47:22,088
Excuse me...
