1
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,267
Looks like she's dragged in a real crowd.

2
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,825
Sure does. Looks like
it's going to be a full house tonight.

3
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,951
What do you say
we run in and check out the show?

4
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:28,428
- How are we doing? All set?
- Big crowd, huh?

5
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,102
Yeah, and not one of them
has got a pot to piss in.

6
00:01:31,188 --> 00:01:35,623
I let myself get talked into this benefit.
I could be making real money tonight.

7
00:01:35,706 --> 00:01:37,696
Let's get this thing started.

8
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:43,455
(cheering)

9
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:50,536
(announcer) And now, back home again,
the one, the only Ellen Aim!

10
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,486
I love you, Ellen.

11
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:16,718
# Lying in your bed on a Saturday night
sweating buckets and it's not even hot

12
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:19,398
# But your brain has got the message
and it's sending it out

13
00:02:19,484 --> 00:02:22,235
# To every nerve
and every muscle you've got

14
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:24,959
# You've got so many dreams
that you don't know where to put them

15
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,838
# So you'd better turn a few of 'em loose

16
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,512
# Your body's got a feeling
that it's starting to rust

17
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,952
# You'd better rev it up and put it to use

18
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:40,029
# And I don't know how I ever thought
that I could make it all alone

19
00:02:40,113 --> 00:02:45,821
# When you only make it better
and it better be tonight

20
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:47,661
# I'll be there for you tonight

21
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,740
# Even if you don't have anywhere to go
you go down on the pedal, ready to roll

22
00:02:52,826 --> 00:02:57,533
# And your speed is all you'll ever need
All you'll ever need to know

23
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:01,534
# Darlin', darlin', you and me,
we're going nowhere slowly

24
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:04,373
# And we gotta get away from the past

25
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,211
# There's nothing wrong
with going nowhere, baby

26
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:12,927
# But we should be going nowhere fast
It's so much better going nowhere fast

27
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:25,403
# Stalking in the shadows
by the light of the moon

28
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,160
# It's like a prison and the night is a cell

29
00:03:28,248 --> 00:03:30,919
# Going anywhere
has gotta be heaven tonight

30
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:34,121
# Cos staying here has gotta be hell

31
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:36,717
# Dying in the city
like a fire on the water

32
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:39,520
# Let's go running on the back of the wind

33
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:42,035
# There's gotta be some action
on the face of the earth

34
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,032
# And I gotta see your face once again

35
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:51,872
# I don't know where I ever got
the bright idea that I was cool

36
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:57,311
# So alone and independent
but I'm depending on you now

37
00:03:57,394 --> 00:04:02,907
# And you'll always be the only thing
that I just can't be without

38
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:07,697
# And I'm out for you tonight
I'm coming out for you tonight

39
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:10,017
# Even if you don't have anywhere to go

40
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:12,538
# You go down on the pedal
and you're ready to roll

41
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:17,377
# And your speed is all you'll ever need
All you'll ever need to know

42
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:21,499
# Darlin', darlin', you and me,
we're going nowhere slowly

46
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,653
# Everybody's going nowhere slowly

47
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:35,485
# They're only fighting
for the chance to be last

00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:59,833

00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:05,916
# Godspeed! Godspeed!

53
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:11,308
- # Godspeed! Speed us away!
- # We're going nowhere fast

00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:14,143
- # Godspeed!
- # Going nowhere fast

55
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:16,983
- # Godspeed!
- # Going nowhere fast

56
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:20,778
# Godspeed! Speed us away!

57
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:22,665

58
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:25,261
- # Godspeed!
- # Going nowhere fast

59
00:05:25,347 --> 00:05:28,143
- # Godspeed!
- # I'm going nowhere fast

60
00:05:28,226 --> 00:05:32,978
# Godspeed! Speed us away!

61
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:35,612
(cheering)

62
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:06,873
Now!

63
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:14,074
What the hell are you doing?

64
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:32,423
What are you guys doing?
Hey, we don't want no trouble.

65
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:41,060
Put me down! No!

66
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:45,184
Put me down! You bastards, put me down!

67
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:48,172
No! No! Let me go!

68
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:50,014
Put me down!

69
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:54,292
(screaming)

70
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:56,973
Help me!

71
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:21,162
(siren)

72
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:23,203
Get him!

73
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:39,266
- Goddamn son-of-a-bitches.
- Hang a 180.

74
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:43,386
What's with that guy?

75
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:51,220
- Watch out.
- These guys are gonna pay.

76
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:59,577
Someone save me!

77
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:03,699
Stop it! Stop it!

78
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:07,693
Stop it!

79
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,302
- Can I help you?
- Coffee.

80
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:27,063
- Cream and sugar?
- Just black.

81
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:41,581
(wolf whistle)

82
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:07,885
You know how to come through a door.
What are you trying to prove?

83
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:10,846
We just came down from King's Park
looking for a good time.

84
00:11:10,928 --> 00:11:14,361
You guys already missed
all the excitement. The party's over.

85
00:11:14,447 --> 00:11:18,482
The Roadmasters are hungry,
and when they're hungry,

86
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:20,280
they eat.

87
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:22,636
The Bombers
have brought this act through.

88
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:26,713
- All you're doing is looking like punks.
- Is that right?

89
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,358
We're just gonna
have to mess the place up.

90
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,427
(china and glass smash)

91
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:38,472
And after we mess your place up,
maybe we'll mess you up.

92
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:45,538
You got a problem with this, pretty boy?

93
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:03,574
Try it again, punk.

94
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:32,164
Come on.

95
00:12:38,242 --> 00:12:40,231
Go on, go home.

96
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:49,907
- What do you think of my new car?
- Looks great.

97
00:12:49,996 --> 00:12:51,872
Sell it and buy me a new window.

98
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:16,739
Tom, come on, slow down.

99
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:19,812
Reva, there is no point stealing a car
and not wringing it out.

100
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:34,611
- When are you going to grow up?
- Why should I? This is more fun.

101
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:38,287
Let me give you some news. The
Bombers and this guy Raven Shaddock,

102
00:13:38,371 --> 00:13:40,121
they stole Ellen Aim.

103
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,847
- How the hell did that happen?
- (police siren)

104
00:13:42,928 --> 00:13:45,805
- Oh, shit.
- Goddamn cops.

105
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:11,344
OK, what do you think this is? We don't
go for that speeding here. Your licence.

106
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,391
Sorry, officer, I must've left it at home.

107
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:18,178
Tom Cody, it's been a couple of years
since I've had any trouble out of you.

108
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:21,544
Ed, I came home to visit my big sister.
You won't have any trouble.

109
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:25,097
Glad to hear it. We don't need somebody
coming here to give us a hard time.

110
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:27,618
Come on, Ed, he just got back.
Give him a break.

111
00:14:27,706 --> 00:14:31,298
Yeah, I'll give him a break.
Get out of here, Cody.

112
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:35,212
Any more driving like that
and I'll give you a ticket.

113
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:37,097
Asshole.

114
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:52,247
Who the hell does that guy think he is?

115
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:56,768
He's always been a real badass.
I busted him a couple of years ago.

116
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:59,646
He had a pistol
in the glove compartment of his car.

117
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:01,208
Real punk, huh?

118
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:05,279
He belongs in jail
with all the other delinquents.

119
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:27,828
Sure I'm not going to be
cramping your style with any guy?

120
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:31,223
Not tonight. I bring one in now and then
but there's nothing steady.

121
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:35,461
- I never find the right one.
- I ain't much luck in that department.

122
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:39,904
Look, Tom, you were close with Ellen.
She wasn't like those tramps you ran with.

123
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:43,500
- Reva, it didn't work out, OK?
- Somebody figured how to make it work.

124
00:15:43,586 --> 00:15:46,178
- She's been living with a guy, Billy Fish.
- Who?

125
00:15:46,264 --> 00:15:49,732
He's done some rock joints in the Battery.
Started managing her.

126
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,539
Yeah, she was always interested
in going someplace.

127
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:54,612
Tom!

128
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,770
- She's not just your old girlfriend.
- What do you want?

129
00:15:58,858 --> 00:15:59,607
You know.

130
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:04,132
You want me to rescue an old girlfriend
shacked up with another guy? Thanks.

131
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,036
- Tequila.
- Hey, Tom! Tom Cody!

132
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,507
A long time, pal.
How's your hammer hanging?

133
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,475
- How's it going, Clyde?
- Not so hot.

134
00:16:38,558 --> 00:16:42,627
I got beat up trying to save your old girl.
I could have used a little help.

135
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:46,752
You should have been there, Tom.
It would've been like the old days.

136
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,663
We'd have kicked ass.

137
00:16:48,753 --> 00:16:52,186
Hey, bartender, do you want to shoot
the shit or get me another drink?

138
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,817
Hey, would you get a load of this honey?
She thinks she owns the place.

139
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:58,579
I'm just trying to get myself a drink, pal.

140
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,225
Well, maybe you've
already had enough, babe.

141
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:03,613
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Do I look like it?

142
00:17:03,704 --> 00:17:07,741
Maybe you ought to pay up. You've
been driving up a tab here all night.

143
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:10,574
- We're not big on credit.
- Are you saying I can't pay?

144
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,208
Yeah, let's see the colour of your money.

145
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:18,414
- There, happy.
- Yeah, but now I don't like your face.

146
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:22,852
You know, everywhere I go,
there's always an asshole.

147
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:34,166
- Hey, have you got any preferences?
- I've always been a tequila man.

148
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,792
Let's get out of here.

149
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:48,160
My name's McCoy. I'm a soldier. At least,
I was up until a year ago. I ran out of wars.

150
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:51,276
- Yeah, what's your spec?
- Motor pool, nothing fancy.

151
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,952
- If it's got wheels, I can drive it and fix it.
- That's funny. I just got out.

152
00:17:56,037 --> 00:17:59,630
- Been R & R ever since.
- Yeah, how did you like the army?

153
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:03,069
I liked shooting the guns,
but I didn't win no medal.

154
00:18:04,753 --> 00:18:06,026
Hey!

155
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:09,626
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

156
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,027
- Nice.
- I know. I just picked it up.

157
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:17,746
Hey, Cody. That's your name, right? Cody.

158
00:18:17,826 --> 00:18:20,941
- Yeah.
- You got a spare bed?

159
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:23,654
You want a quick tumble, huh?

160
00:18:25,462 --> 00:18:30,452
You may have a rough time with this one
and I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

161
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,449
You're not my type.

162
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:35,846
Yeah, I guess it figures.
I ain't had much luck with women lately.

163
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:39,722
Yeah, you'll live. Something tells me
that getting girls ain't your problem.

164
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:43,282
- Maybe some other time.
- I doubt it, but anything's possible.

165
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:46,325
Hey, look.

166
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:50,197
About the spare bed. I'm just passing
through. I don't know anybody.

167
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:53,323
I'm between jobs and last time I heard,
hotels cost money.

168
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:58,435
Get in.

169
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:14,634
My sister's got the bedroom. I've got
the spare. That puts you on the couch.

170
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:18,263
- Thanks, man, I appreciate it.
- Yeah, no sweat.

171
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:31,501
There you go, McCoy.
I'll see you in the morning.

172
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:37,062
- Hey, you always walk around packed?
- I told you, I'm a soldier.

173
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:40,180
Well, don't go pointing
that thing at me. I wouldn't like it.

174
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,855
I don't go pointing it
unless I'm gonna use it.

175
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:44,931
Yeah, right.

176
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:15,435
# Take a look at my eyes

177
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:19,674
# No' you can't hide the truth

178
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:23,878
# You don't get by on pride

179
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,952
# lt'll run over you

180
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:32,875
# But since you let me down
I'm hard to be around

181
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:38,266
# I don't know what I'm gonna do
lt'll never be you

182
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:43,065
# Never be you

183
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:45,139
(knocking)

184
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:52,338
OK, you got it. I'm gonna go and get her.
But I ain't doing it for nothing.

185
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:55,938
Tell this Mr Billy Fish to meet me
at the diner tomorrow at 12.00.

186
00:20:56,024 --> 00:20:58,935
Me and him
are going to talk some business.

187
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:01,694
And there's a girl I picked up
sleeping on the couch.

188
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:05,691
- Give her some coffee in the morning.
- How come she's in the front room?

189
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:07,768
Why don't you go ask her?

190
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:30,676
Hey, Pete!

191
00:21:32,684 --> 00:21:35,516
Hey, I really needed a place to stay.
Thanks for the sofa.

192
00:21:35,603 --> 00:21:39,798
Oh, that's OK. You're the first girl
Tom ever brought home that used it.

193
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,632
Sometimes it helps a guy out
if you don't make it so easy.

194
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:46,869
He could use a little help in that direction.
He ought to meet a few more like you.

195
00:21:48,397 --> 00:21:50,783
Fella came through here
a couple of months ago.

196
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:54,992
Tapped out, had to part
with this outfit after a card game.

197
00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:58,143
Real unhappy about it too
because it's all custom stuff.

198
00:21:58,231 --> 00:22:01,778
Tom wasn't going for being
number two to her music.

199
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:06,144
So he took off. He was crazy about Ellen.
He's the kind that doesn't like to admit it.

200
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:07,706
Sure, I know the type.

201
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:14,499
Some people who never talk about their
feelings got 'em deeper than anybody.

202
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,379
Others never talk
about them cos they ain't got any.

203
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,005
- What's your story?
- Me? Just looking for work.

204
00:22:50,684 --> 00:22:52,638
- You must be Billy Fish.
- Yeah.

205
00:22:52,722 --> 00:22:55,393
So what gives? Make it fast,
my time is valuable.

206
00:22:55,482 --> 00:22:58,040
You want Ellen Aim back.
I'm gonna get her.

207
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,270
- You and what army?
- I can see you two will get along just fine.

208
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:06,707
- I want ten grand.
- Easy, all you gotta do is earn it.

209
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:12,186
I'll earn it, and you're gonna help. Reva
told me you used to live in the Battery.

210
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:16,626
I started out there. It's the shits. I wouldn't
go back to that dump if you paid me.

211
00:23:16,711 --> 00:23:19,825
You're goin'. I need somebody
who knows their way around.

212
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,740
I don't think so. It's not my scene.

213
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:25,898
If you want your meal ticket back,
get in the car, otherwise the deal is off.

214
00:23:25,986 --> 00:23:28,656
Cody, you sound pretty dumb,
but nobody's that dumb.

215
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:32,974
I'm the one paying you. That means
you go get her and bring her back to me.

216
00:23:33,062 --> 00:23:38,088
You smart guys always figure you can
hire a bum like me to do your dirty work.

217
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:41,647
- Well, not this time.
- Can you really get her back?

218
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:44,375
You got a better volunteer?

219
00:23:54,091 --> 00:23:57,525
All right, I'll go.
She's real important to me.

220
00:24:09,962 --> 00:24:12,396
The Battery is gonna be
nothing but trouble.

221
00:24:12,481 --> 00:24:15,438
Yeah? Well, I'm getting paid for it.
Right, Fish?

222
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,952
- That's right, Cody.
- Cut me in, I'll back you up.

223
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:20,949
- I don't think so.
- We're not taking no skirt along.

224
00:24:21,037 --> 00:24:24,549
- Look, I don't think you can handle it, OK?
- What do I gotta do?

225
00:24:24,636 --> 00:24:27,273
People don't have written references
for this work.

226
00:24:27,354 --> 00:24:29,309
You should know that, Cody.

227
00:24:30,272 --> 00:24:33,660
I need the job. I'm plenty good enough
and I ain't gonna let you down.

228
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,898
Listen, skirt, let me make it simple
for you. Take a hike.

229
00:24:39,068 --> 00:24:41,738
All right, I'll cut you in
for ten per cent but get this.

230
00:24:41,826 --> 00:24:47,057
You're working for me. I tell you to do
something, you do it, no more, no less.

231
00:24:47,144 --> 00:24:49,815
And if you start dragging your ass,
I'm sending you home.

232
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:51,970
- I got it.
- What is this? Get serious.

233
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:55,289
I'm not paying you to take
some sweetie-pie along for company.

234
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:57,368
You drive.

235
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:01,852
Don't worry about it. They always hire
bums like me for jobs like this.

236
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:28,237
I'll take you to where the Bombers
hang out, but I'm not taking any risks.

237
00:25:28,323 --> 00:25:31,073
I'm not paying you to add thrills to my life.

238
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,718
You've got a big mouth.

239
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,949
Butch, I buy and sell people
more valuable than you every day.

240
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:40,108
It's hard to figure out what's more
pathetic, the way you talk or dress.

241
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:43,948
Let me tell you. These clothes
are worth more than you make in a year.

242
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:46,830
I can see working with you two
is gonna be a real dream.

243
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:09,138
If they've got her anywhere, it's Torchie's.
It's a knockdown joint, no class.

244
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,131
I used to book bands in there. It's in
the middle of a big factory. It's the shits.

245
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:16,731
You'll love it, McCoy. Just your style.
OK, Cody, what's the plan?

246
00:26:16,816 --> 00:26:19,045
How do you figure to handle these guys?

247
00:26:19,135 --> 00:26:22,284
Kill Bombers and we'll be in worse shape
than we're already in.

248
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:27,491
I don't have to kill anybody. Motorcycles
don't run when you shoot holes in them.

249
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:56,994
Some neighbourhood. Everything's dead.
What a place to come to.

250
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:59,634
Keep going straight
then turn left under the bridge.

251
00:26:59,714 --> 00:27:03,991
- What, are you giving the orders now?
- I know my way around, remember?

252
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:08,221
I'll take care of the orders. Get under
the bridge, pull over and kill the lights.

253
00:27:41,813 --> 00:27:44,200
# Well, one bad stud moved
in my neighbourhood

254
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,847
# Well, one bad stud moved
in my neighbourhood

255
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:53,884
# He's big and, man,
I know he ain't no good

256
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:57,196
# He don't wear no hat,
and, Lord, he don't wear no shoes

257
00:27:58,165 --> 00:28:02,280
# He don't wear no hat,
and, Lord, he don't wear no shoes

258
00:28:02,362 --> 00:28:06,353
# He just hangs on the corner
singing old country blues

259
00:28:06,441 --> 00:28:08,509
# Well, one bad stud

260
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,828
# One bad stud

261
00:28:10,918 --> 00:28:14,669
# One bad stud
One bad stud

262
00:28:14,755 --> 00:28:17,985
# I said, one, one, one, one
One bad stud

263
00:28:19,193 --> 00:28:22,865
# If he likes your baby,
you can kiss your baby goodbye

264
00:28:23,351 --> 00:28:27,137
# If he likes your baby,
you can kiss your baby goodbye

265
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,220
# Cos the girls all love him
like a schoolboy loves his pie

266
00:28:31,307 --> 00:28:34,900
# He loves his whiskey,
he loves his rock'n'rye

267
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:39,421
# Yes, he loves his whiskey,
he loves his rock'n'rye

268
00:28:39,503 --> 00:28:43,778
# You know it takes ten bottles
to make that fool get high

269
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:46,577
# Well, one bad stud...

270
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,840
You're making things
real hard on yourself.

271
00:29:11,926 --> 00:29:16,280
You act nice, you and me fall in love
for a week or two, and then I let you go.

272
00:29:16,364 --> 00:29:18,352
Nobody gets hurt.

273
00:29:19,403 --> 00:29:22,597
You see? I ain't such a bad guy.

274
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:27,354
I just get excited around pretty girls.

275
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:39,181
# Well, one bad stud

276
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:41,545
# One bad stud

277
00:29:41,631 --> 00:29:45,303
# One bad stud
One bad stud

278
00:29:45,388 --> 00:29:47,618
# I said, one, one, one, one

279
00:29:47,947 --> 00:29:49,698
(music climaxes)

280
00:30:10,496 --> 00:30:13,485
From now on, any mistakes
and I'm making you walk home.

281
00:30:13,573 --> 00:30:18,769
- Walk around here? I'd get killed.
- You got it. What about you, McCoy?

282
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:22,122
Are we gonna do it
or are we gonna talk about it?

283
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,199
All right.

284
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,706
The main drag is around here somewhere.

285
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:48,988
- What the hell's that?
- I guess you don't know who I am.

286
00:30:51,635 --> 00:30:53,431
Things have got funny around here.

287
00:30:53,514 --> 00:30:57,265
All kinds of strangers
sneaking through the alleys.

288
00:30:57,351 --> 00:31:01,137
What the hell are we talking
to this creep for? Let's get outta here.

289
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:04,742
My gosh, you're scared.
What's even funnier, you're afraid of me.

290
00:31:04,827 --> 00:31:07,258
Trying to get away from you.
We've got business.

291
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:10,495
Oh, you're dumb. And you're short.

292
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:13,016
- Real short.
- (she laughs)

293
00:31:13,782 --> 00:31:17,489
- You're after that girl, aren't you?
- What makes you say that?

294
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,217
You're down a back alley
at night with a bunch of guns.

295
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:22,414
You here to give the Battery
a coat of paint?

296
00:31:22,498 --> 00:31:25,011
- Where are they keeping her?
- Torchie's.

297
00:31:25,097 --> 00:31:28,167
- Don't tell 'em I told you, though.
- Pay him.

298
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,643
- Yeah, pay me.
- I'm not gonna pay this jerk.

299
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:35,689
Shithead, give him some of your money
or I'll give him some of your money.

300
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:38,158
Don't call me shithead.

301
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:42,241
You've gotta keep moving forward.
That's the point of things. I appreciate it.

302
00:31:42,328 --> 00:31:44,316
You could buy some soap.

303
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:49,837
I don't need this guy to tell me she's
at Torchie's. I said she was at Torchie's.

304
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:51,720
I am a shithead.

305
00:32:12,953 --> 00:32:16,828
OK, Fish, head back to the car.
I want you in that doorway in 15 minutes.

306
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:20,617
- And I mean 15 minutes.
- They'll notice me in a second there.

307
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:23,220
I'll give them other things to worry about.

308
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:25,501
What about her?
She was supposed to drive.

309
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:29,894
Get moving. You better be ready
when we get there.

310
00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:38,179
- Do you trust him or are you desperate?
- Take the front entrance. I'll go topside.

311
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:41,454
If you can work your way upstairs, fine.
If not, I'll handle it.

312
00:32:41,537 --> 00:32:44,731
Just what I always wanted to do, Cody.
Take on the Bombers.

313
00:33:05,725 --> 00:33:07,714
Hey, baby!

314
00:33:22,196 --> 00:33:24,184
(shouting)

315
00:33:30,272 --> 00:33:34,466
# I've been around the world
And every man bleeds the same

316
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:40,855
# But when the lights are dim
You never know who's to blame

317
00:33:43,425 --> 00:33:49,133
# I don't want no scars to show
I don't want no one to know

318
00:33:49,222 --> 00:33:53,133
# So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

319
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:58,295
# No other place for me to go

320
00:33:58,377 --> 00:34:01,413
# No other place for dying slow

321
00:34:01,495 --> 00:34:05,043
# So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

322
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:14,719
# I've been around the world
I'll take credit for the things I've done

323
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:20,556
# But when the lights are dim
I'm not the only guilty one

324
00:34:22,804 --> 00:34:28,796
# I don't want no scars to show
I don't want no one to know

325
00:34:28,882 --> 00:34:32,156
# So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

326
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,230
Hey! Hey! How are you doing, babe?
Come around here much?

327
00:34:36,318 --> 00:34:39,308
- Only for some action.
- You're talking to the right guy.

328
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:41,147
- Says who?
- Says me.

329
00:34:41,235 --> 00:34:45,465
- I like a guy that's got confidence.
- All right.

330
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,904
# I've been around the world
And every story ends the same

331
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:57,656
(whistle)

332
00:35:02,543 --> 00:35:08,331
# I don't want no scars to show
I don't want no one to know

333
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,536
# So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

334
00:35:12,618 --> 00:35:17,053
That way's the card game. We're going
down here. We've got a party to go to.

335
00:35:17,696 --> 00:35:19,685
# No other place for dying slow

336
00:35:21,215 --> 00:35:24,807
Check it out, baby. This is the party room.
How do you like it, huh?

337
00:35:24,893 --> 00:35:28,201
Had a lot of good times here
so let's party, huh?

338
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,406
Hey, killer.

339
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:34,161
- Can I take my jacket off first?
- You can take off whatever you want.

340
00:35:34,248 --> 00:35:39,524
All right... Now listen to me, buddy.
There is just one thing I want you to do.

341
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:42,640
- That is to keep quiet.
- Come on, babe, is this thing loaded?

342
00:35:42,722 --> 00:35:45,918
We'll play a game you Bombers will like.
It's called Lights Out.

343
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:50,867
# No place for me to go
No other place for dying slow

344
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:54,107
# So I'll be killing time

345
00:35:54,197 --> 00:35:57,107
# Just killing time

346
00:35:57,194 --> 00:36:00,230
# So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

347
00:36:17,465 --> 00:36:19,454
Knock, knock.

348
00:36:52,088 --> 00:36:53,918
(commotion)

349
00:36:54,726 --> 00:36:59,353
Go ahead and take that money, sweetie.
You better pray you get out of the Battery.

350
00:36:59,443 --> 00:37:03,320
- I don't think she's after the money.
- (distant gunshot)

351
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,304
Get out of here!

352
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:40,855
Poker's a real interesting game
when you've got all the best cards.

353
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,614
Next time, right in your nuts, pal.

354
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,119
Guys, it's been a slice.

355
00:38:08,568 --> 00:38:10,443
- Who are you?
- I'm a big fan.

356
00:38:10,526 --> 00:38:12,321
Come on. Let's go.

357
00:38:15,523 --> 00:38:17,318
Who is that guy?

358
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,113
What the hell's going on here?

359
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,836
Move it, move it!

360
00:38:34,554 --> 00:38:36,543
- Which way?
- Follow me.

361
00:38:48,186 --> 00:38:51,256
Jesus, am I glad to see you?
I thought you were gone forever.

362
00:38:51,345 --> 00:38:54,573
- This is no time to check out the sights.
- I'm gonna run these guys.

363
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:56,618
- I'm staying with you.
- Stay in the car.

364
00:38:56,703 --> 00:39:00,057
Stay with your boyfriend.
McCoy, meet me at Grand St underpass.

365
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,412
If we don't see you, Cody, have a nice life.

366
00:39:57,831 --> 00:40:02,822
Can't you drive this car any faster? I don't
want any Bombers sneaking up on us.

367
00:40:02,907 --> 00:40:07,819
- Where's Grand St? I never heard of it.
- Turn it off, Fish, you sound pathetic.

368
00:40:15,141 --> 00:40:16,937
Well...

369
00:40:18,061 --> 00:40:21,812
Looks like I finally ran into someone
that likes to play as rough as I do.

370
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:25,523
- Yeah, this must be your lucky night.
- I'm lucky?

371
00:40:25,615 --> 00:40:27,924
I guess maybe I am.

372
00:40:28,015 --> 00:40:31,924
You're dumb, real dumb,
if you think you can pull this off.

373
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:35,720
I think you're forgetting something.
I got the gun.

374
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:38,802
I can get guns, smart guy, lots of 'em.

375
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:44,279
- Now, why don't you tell me your name?
- Tom Cody. Pleased to meet ya.

376
00:40:46,205 --> 00:40:48,081
I'll be coming for her.

377
00:40:48,845 --> 00:40:50,753
And I'll be coming for you too.

378
00:40:50,842 --> 00:40:53,310
Sure you will, and I'll be waitin'.

379
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:44,283
A couple of minutes
and then we get out of here.

380
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:48,650
- What are you talking about?
- Saving our ass. We've a lot to live for.

381
00:41:48,732 --> 00:41:50,881
He got me.
I'm not going back without him.

382
00:41:50,971 --> 00:41:54,040
Don't worry, he's getting paid
a lot of money to look after Raven.

383
00:41:54,129 --> 00:41:56,164
- What money?
- Do you think it's for love?

384
00:41:56,249 --> 00:42:00,525
You think he's doing this cos he's a fan?
He's getting paid. He takes his chances.

385
00:42:00,606 --> 00:42:02,754
Hey, too bad, Billy.

386
00:42:02,846 --> 00:42:06,836
Looks like Ellen's old flame
decided to show up.

387
00:42:23,394 --> 00:42:25,190
OK, we're on the move.

388
00:42:26,793 --> 00:42:30,180
- What is this old flame stuff?
- Ellen used to go with Cody.

389
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,501
Real hot'n'heavy from what I heard.
Know what I mean?

390
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,579
- Is she kidding?
- Let's not get into it now, OK, Billy?

391
00:42:36,668 --> 00:42:38,657
Hard news, huh, shorty?

392
00:42:58,058 --> 00:43:01,650
Cody, we've had our differences
but it looks like we've got it made now.

393
00:43:01,735 --> 00:43:04,328
We just zoom along here
then we're home and dry.

394
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:08,007
I got news for you. It ain't that simple.
We've got to bury the car.

395
00:43:08,091 --> 00:43:12,481
- Bury the car? What?
- He means "get rid of it", stupid.

396
00:43:12,569 --> 00:43:14,638
Get rid of the car? What's wrong with it?

397
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:17,718
Is this what I'm paying you for,
these brilliant ideas?

398
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:21,080
Why don't we hand ourselves
over to Raven and ask him to shoot us?

399
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,546
You two go ahead.
I want to talk alone with Tom for a minute.

400
00:43:52,628 --> 00:43:56,538
What are you talking about?
What are you going with him for?

401
00:43:56,627 --> 00:44:00,742
I don't like the way this looks. I'm paying
the bills. How about some respect?

402
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:08,218
- What do you want to talk about?
- I've got a lot to say.

403
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,291
No, you don't. You have nothing
to say to me. Go talk to your boyfriend.

404
00:44:12,378 --> 00:44:16,687
What was I supposed to do? I had work.
Things were starting to happen for me.

405
00:44:16,775 --> 00:44:20,130
- Yeah, so bye-bye, Tom, right?
- You took off and joined the army.

406
00:44:20,215 --> 00:44:23,329
Forget all this. It's history.
From now on, I'm just like you.

407
00:44:23,412 --> 00:44:25,322
I do what I'm good at. I do it for money.

408
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:29,800
- Is that why you came and got me?
- Right. Billy Fish is paying me ten grand.

409
00:44:29,889 --> 00:44:33,402
- I can't believe you'd do that.
- You'd better get used to the idea.

410
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:38,801
- Wonder what they're talking about.
- Who says they're talking?

411
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:42,670
- Cute.
- It's just a joke. You know what I mean?

412
00:44:43,402 --> 00:44:45,437
How big a thing do you think they had?

413
00:44:45,521 --> 00:44:49,512
- From what I hear, it was real major.
- Well, she's with me now.

414
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:54,828
Right, against a big, tough, good-looking
guy like you, Cody don't stand a chance.

415
00:45:02,752 --> 00:45:07,742
- I hope you two straightened things out.
- Yeah, we got a lot straightened out.

416
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:12,582
- It was a real eye-opener.
- I think I hurt your girlfriend's feelings.

417
00:45:13,147 --> 00:45:19,139
What does he mean? What did he say?
Did he say anything about me? Tell me.

418
00:45:38,775 --> 00:45:41,131
# I'm tired

419
00:45:42,857 --> 00:45:45,770
# I'm thirsty

420
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,939
# I'm wild-eyed

421
00:45:50,942 --> 00:45:54,095
# In my misery

422
00:45:55,585 --> 00:45:57,382
# Timeless

423
00:45:59,107 --> 00:46:02,464
# In your finery

424
00:46:03,629 --> 00:46:06,544
# A high price

425
00:46:07,551 --> 00:46:11,149
# For your luxury, yeah

426
00:46:13,275 --> 00:46:16,508
# Sorcerer

427
00:46:16,597 --> 00:46:21,037
# Who is the master?

428
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:25,161
# Man and woman on a star stream

429
00:46:25,243 --> 00:46:29,797
# In the middle of a snow dream

430
00:46:29,885 --> 00:46:32,799
# Sorcerer

431
00:46:32,887 --> 00:46:36,643
# Show me the high life

432
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:41,641
# Come over

433
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:45,932
# Let me put you on ice

434
00:46:51,498 --> 00:46:53,296
# I'm tired

435
00:46:55,181 --> 00:46:59,061
# When I need you badly

436
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:01,934
# Wild-eyed

437
00:47:03,425 --> 00:47:07,500
# In the middle of a dream

438
00:47:08,308 --> 00:47:10,106
# Timeless

439
00:47:12,711 --> 00:47:16,149
Hey, hi, you guys.
Where are you guys going?

440
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:18,828
- We're nobody, going nowhere.
- Nobody goes nowhere.

441
00:47:18,914 --> 00:47:24,230
Knock it off, we're not interested
in conversation, OK, moron?

442
00:47:24,317 --> 00:47:27,834
I know you.
I love your stuff so much. I really do.

443
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,675
Look, if you love me so much,
go away and leave us alone.

444
00:47:30,762 --> 00:47:33,994
No, look, I'm your biggest fan.
Let me go with you.

445
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:36,440
And I tell you, you gotta get off the street.

446
00:47:36,526 --> 00:47:40,439
The cops know the guys that
hit the Battery are coming through here.

447
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:43,442
Shit. We've gotta get a new set of wheels.

448
00:47:43,531 --> 00:47:49,324
Great, we just got rid of the old wheels.
Wonderful leadership, Cody.

449
00:47:57,419 --> 00:48:00,377
What's the matter with you?
Are you looking to get run over?

450
00:48:00,459 --> 00:48:03,771
- Me and my friends need a lift.
- So what? This ain't no muni bus.

451
00:48:03,862 --> 00:48:05,978
- We need a lift real bad.
- Look.

452
00:48:06,063 --> 00:48:12,222
Let me make it real clear. Nobody tells me
where to take my bus. You dig?

453
00:48:14,109 --> 00:48:19,139
We're very flexible. We'll take you where
you want to go. You just say the word.

454
00:48:19,232 --> 00:48:21,950
You folks just hop right in.
Make yourselves at home.

455
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:24,308
I'm driving.

456
00:48:24,395 --> 00:48:27,068
Bird, what the hell are you doing?

457
00:48:27,156 --> 00:48:30,434
Get off this bus. Oh, man.

458
00:48:44,247 --> 00:48:48,162
Hey, how are you guys doing? Don't
worry, we're not gonna hurt you none.

459
00:48:48,249 --> 00:48:53,406
That's great. Oh, I'm glad to hear that.
We're the Sorels. I'm Bird.

460
00:48:53,493 --> 00:48:57,612
These are my associates. This is Lester.
My man BJ. And that's Reggie.

461
00:49:00,817 --> 00:49:04,016
- Aren't you Ellen Aim?
- That's right. It's Ellen Aim.

462
00:49:04,098 --> 00:49:07,330
Hey, Ellen, do you guys need an opener?
We're good.

463
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,538
- We are.
- We can't seem to get anything going.

464
00:49:10,621 --> 00:49:14,583
I handle the management and the
booking. Shut up and leave Ellen alone.

465
00:49:14,665 --> 00:49:17,419
- What did he say?
- I know how tough it can be.

466
00:49:17,506 --> 00:49:21,421
- Baby, you don't even begin to know.
- What did I tell you guys? Cool it.

467
00:49:27,512 --> 00:49:28,502
Hey!

468
00:49:28,593 --> 00:49:31,870
If you've got any chance
of missing the cops, it's through here.

469
00:49:32,755 --> 00:49:35,873
- Yeah, so what are our chances?
- Horrible.

470
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:38,950
- And terrible.
- That's just great.

471
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:41,555
Look, we don't want to mess
with Ardmore cops.

472
00:49:41,642 --> 00:49:45,522
They busted me and threw my ass right
in jail because I wouldn't pay 'em off.

473
00:49:45,604 --> 00:49:48,118
- What did they bust you for?
- Disturbing the peace.

474
00:49:48,205 --> 00:49:52,520
- They said I got out of line in some bar.
- Great. I love a girl with class.

475
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:28,107
- This is great.
- You want to help change this tyre?

476
00:50:28,189 --> 00:50:31,102
Changing flat tyres isn't
exactly my line of work, dear.

477
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,466
If that's the case,
then why don't you shut up?

478
00:50:33,552 --> 00:50:35,350
(mocking grumble)

479
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:44,869
I wish I could write songs. I just can't
figure out how to do it right, like you do it.

480
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:49,033
I can't figure out how you work out
the rhymes and the melodies.

481
00:50:49,121 --> 00:50:52,911
Somebody else writes the songs.
Billy buys or steals them. I can't write.

482
00:50:53,003 --> 00:50:56,202
- I always thought those were your songs.
- I just sing 'em.

483
00:50:56,286 --> 00:51:00,680
Yeah, but when you sing 'em, you make
it yours. That's the way it is, right?

484
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:02,567
I guess so. Who knows?

485
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:07,247
The famous Sorels sure put
a lot of money into that bus.

486
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:09,564
I didn't know you had a thing with Ellen.

487
00:51:09,654 --> 00:51:13,285
You better get some smarts.
Adjust to the fact you're out of the picture.

488
00:51:13,377 --> 00:51:16,814
You see, I do things for her,
things a guy like you could never do.

489
00:51:16,898 --> 00:51:19,971
Things that matter in the real world.

490
00:51:24,143 --> 00:51:28,775
You know, the only trouble with kicking
the shit out of you is it would be too easy.

491
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:38,903
Keep your hands off the suit, buddy.

492
00:51:41,873 --> 00:51:45,345
Come on, hurry the hell up
with that flat tyre. Let's get going.

493
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:49,317
# Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two, one

494
00:51:49,518 --> 00:51:53,115
# Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two, one

495
00:51:53,201 --> 00:51:57,434
# Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two, one

496
00:51:57,522 --> 00:52:01,758
# Remember when you didn't love me

497
00:52:01,846 --> 00:52:05,442
# Now all the time you're thinking of me

498
00:52:05,528 --> 00:52:09,681
# If life is great, you're all I'm living for

499
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:13,286
# This is my countdown to love

500
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:16,843
# Oh, this is my countdown to love

501
00:52:18,416 --> 00:52:21,932
# You are the one love in my life

502
00:52:22,018 --> 00:52:25,534
# I know you feel that way too

503
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:30,176
# Oh, what a thrill
when I'm holding you near

504
00:52:30,262 --> 00:52:34,019
# All of my wild dreams come true

505
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:38,947
# Forever more you'll be my lover

506
00:52:39,028 --> 00:52:42,578
# Because for me
there'll never be another

507
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:46,630
# Together forever
we'll be as one

508
00:52:46,713 --> 00:52:48,909
- (laughs) Pretty good, you guys.
- # This is my countdown to love

509
00:52:51,074 --> 00:52:53,225
- # This is my countdown to love
- Cody.

510
00:52:53,316 --> 00:52:57,756
Ellen, Baby Doll, get down in the back.
Fish, McCoy, we work for the Sorels.

511
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,153
- Fish, you're the manager.
- I'm way ahead of you, Cody.

512
00:53:02,241 --> 00:53:05,758
I'll handle this. I'll talk us through.

513
00:53:19,372 --> 00:53:22,970
Hey, guys, how's it going?
I'm the bus driver here for the Sorels.

514
00:53:23,055 --> 00:53:26,173
We're on our way to a gig
at an after-hours joint.

515
00:53:26,256 --> 00:53:30,297
- The Sorels, the singers. You know 'em?
- No, never heard of 'em.

516
00:53:30,378 --> 00:53:34,214
- You know what's going on here?
- All I know is we're running real late.

517
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,295
Babe, some outfit broke into the Battery
and burned it down.

518
00:53:37,383 --> 00:53:40,296
- Really?
- Knock off the crap, will ya?

519
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:44,427
Anybody that goes into the Battery and
does some damage deserves a medal.

520
00:53:44,508 --> 00:53:47,467
- Let me tell you how we look at it.
- Cut the shit, OK?

521
00:53:47,549 --> 00:53:49,906
You guys have got a big job to do.

522
00:53:49,991 --> 00:53:54,144
Now, let us through or do you want
to come to a financial arrangement?

523
00:53:54,233 --> 00:53:58,912
- What do you think, Harry?
- What we've got here is a model citizen.

524
00:53:58,995 --> 00:54:01,875
I knew you guys talked my language.

525
00:54:05,681 --> 00:54:08,275
Keep it coming.

526
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:11,673
- Just take a big bite.
- That's right.

527
00:54:11,763 --> 00:54:17,317
- There's some integrity left in the force!
- You are too anxious to buy us off.

528
00:54:17,407 --> 00:54:20,719
- Spade musicians and a wad of money.
- (all) Spade?

529
00:54:20,808 --> 00:54:23,643
All right, everybody off the bus.

530
00:54:26,252 --> 00:54:28,721
All right. Now, this is
how we're going to play it.

531
00:54:28,813 --> 00:54:33,684
You're going to walk off this bus
like there's nothing wrong. Get me?

532
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,339
- All right, down on the ground.
- Do it now!

533
00:54:42,422 --> 00:54:44,458
- All right. OK.
- Get on with it.

534
00:54:46,585 --> 00:54:50,705
Don't worry about it, fellas.
We'll be out of your face in no time.

535
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:55,260
Some of you have got cute little asses.
A shame to blow them off.

536
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:57,625
- Get down.
- Holy shit.

537
00:54:59,032 --> 00:55:01,467
- (wild cheering)
- All right.

538
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:11,750
Come on, man, let's get outta here.

539
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,638
Let's go.

540
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:16,199
(shouting)

541
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:32,483
- Go! Go!
- (shouting)

542
00:55:32,572 --> 00:55:37,127
Shut the hell up! McCoy, pull down
a back alley. We need to dump the bus.

543
00:55:37,216 --> 00:55:39,525
First he dumps the car and now the bus.

544
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:47,931
Code 99. Code 99.
Blockade across on Ardmore.

545
00:55:48,022 --> 00:55:50,218
- Over here.
- Suspects armed and dangerous.

546
00:55:50,302 --> 00:55:52,977
Repeat, armed and dangerous.
Broke blockade.

547
00:55:53,065 --> 00:55:57,583
Heading north on Ardmore.
Cannot pursue. Do you copy?

548
00:55:57,667 --> 00:56:00,706
Goddamn it, this is the blockade
at Ardmore. Come back to me.

549
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,349
Whoa!

550
00:56:17,438 --> 00:56:19,236
(sirens)

551
00:56:32,609 --> 00:56:34,600
- Move over.
- Faster.

552
00:56:44,294 --> 00:56:47,925
- We had $1,000 in that bus.
- I lost my clothes. The luggage is gone.

553
00:56:48,017 --> 00:56:50,487
- All the sheet music is gone.
- This is great.

554
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:54,209
- On our way to the Richmond. No bus.
- You shouldn't have stopped.

555
00:56:54,302 --> 00:56:55,701
I...

556
00:57:12,032 --> 00:57:14,706
He ain't a real social kind of guy, is he?

557
00:57:14,794 --> 00:57:18,072
Really?
Gee, I think he's a real sweetheart.

558
00:57:18,156 --> 00:57:20,386
Cut him some slack. He was there for you.

559
00:57:20,477 --> 00:57:22,069
Yeah, he earned his money.

560
00:57:22,158 --> 00:57:25,550
You've got a funny way of sayin' thanks
when someone saves your ass.

561
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:30,159
Why don't you go and sit with your pal
Billy? I guess he's more your kind of guy.

562
00:57:30,244 --> 00:57:32,394
Yeah, I think maybe I will.

563
00:57:46,173 --> 00:57:51,044
Don't worry, babe.
Everything is going to be OK from now on.

564
00:57:52,298 --> 00:57:54,095
We're gonna be great.

565
00:58:24,637 --> 00:58:27,105
Reva, Ellen Aim is back. Tom is with her.

566
00:58:27,197 --> 00:58:29,189
- Is he OK?
- He looked all right to me.

567
00:58:30,478 --> 00:58:32,276
Chief.

568
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,449
Tom.

569
00:58:52,212 --> 00:58:56,572
Aw, Reva, cut it out. We made it.
Everybody's in one piece.

570
00:58:56,656 --> 00:58:59,295
What about that, Ellen? You OK?

571
00:59:01,259 --> 00:59:05,652
- Yeah, I'm all right, I guess.
- She's tired. She's been roughed up.

572
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:09,018
I'm gonna take her back to the hotel
so she can get some rest.

573
00:59:09,103 --> 00:59:11,537
This started because of a gig
in this shithole.

574
00:59:11,624 --> 00:59:15,300
I should have stayed
the hell away from this dump.

575
00:59:15,387 --> 00:59:19,746
- Is that the way you feel about it, Ellen?
- I just want to get away from here.

576
00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:22,743
- Get back on the road.
- Now you're talking, kiddo.

577
00:59:22,832 --> 00:59:26,030
Come on, let's get outta here.

578
00:59:26,113 --> 00:59:30,188
I hate you for taking money
to come and get me.

579
00:59:31,596 --> 00:59:33,872
That's tellin' him, Ellen.

580
00:59:35,758 --> 00:59:37,556
(cheering)

581
00:59:51,728 --> 00:59:55,006
I guess she doesn't like you much.
She doesn't seem thankful.

582
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:59,802
- One thing about you, you catch on quick.
- That's right and I get the job done.

583
00:59:59,893 --> 01:00:03,365
Good. Because I think it's just starting.

584
01:00:04,296 --> 01:00:06,094
(motorcycle)

585
01:00:32,793 --> 01:00:36,707
- What does he want to talk about?
- Tom Cody.

586
01:00:39,637 --> 01:00:42,027
I want Tom Cody.

587
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:48,232
I want to nail his head to the sidewalk
under the marquee that says "Ellen Aim".

588
01:00:48,322 --> 01:00:51,714
And just to prove to you
I'm gonna be a nice guy,

589
01:00:51,805 --> 01:00:54,718
I'm coming in with just two of my men.

590
01:00:54,807 --> 01:00:59,279
After I take care of Cody,
there'll be no more trouble.

591
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:05,167
Do your job, man. Keep the peace.

592
01:01:31,189 --> 01:01:33,577
Hey, Cody, I need a drink.
Let's get outta here.

593
01:01:33,669 --> 01:01:35,980
Maybe I can pick a fight
with that bartender.

594
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:37,950
No, not this time.

595
01:01:46,397 --> 01:01:49,994
Hey, McCoy, look,
I'll get you your money later, OK?

596
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,311
Is that all you've got to say?

597
01:01:52,401 --> 01:01:55,155
Yeah, that's all.
What else do you wanna hear?

598
01:01:55,242 --> 01:01:58,714
- Look, I did real good back there.
- So what? I'm all out of medals.

599
01:01:58,805 --> 01:02:01,400
Besides, you're getting paid.

600
01:02:03,688 --> 01:02:09,608
You know, Reva. Ellen Aim was right
about one thing. Your brother's a jerk.

601
01:02:28,102 --> 01:02:30,664
What's your problem?
Feeling sorry for yourself?

602
01:02:30,744 --> 01:02:35,183
- Don't start on me, Reva.
- She tells you it doesn't mean a thing.

603
01:02:35,267 --> 01:02:37,828
The worst part
is she runs off with Billy Fish.

604
01:02:37,908 --> 01:02:41,869
I didn't ask you to go out and get Ellen
Aim because she looks great on stage.

605
01:02:41,951 --> 01:02:45,548
- What the hell do you care about, then?
- About you.

606
01:02:45,633 --> 01:02:49,708
And this town. If you're gonna fight,
you're supposed to fight for something.

607
01:02:49,795 --> 01:02:54,188
You and Billy Fish are the same.
You're both selfish. All you worry about...

608
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,839
- Hi, Ed.
- I came to talk to your brother.

609
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,717
Come on outside.

610
01:03:09,889 --> 01:03:14,566
Raven says he has to face you alone
right here in the Richmond.

611
01:03:14,651 --> 01:03:19,169
I'm ordering you to get out of town, Tom.
I want you on a train tonight.

612
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:23,248
If Raven comes in here to face you,
I'll be waiting for him with a lot of guns.

613
01:03:23,336 --> 01:03:25,487
I'm throwing his ass in jail.

614
01:03:25,578 --> 01:03:28,571
I am not gonna sit around and watch
two maniacs play out

615
01:03:28,659 --> 01:03:31,460
some little game about personal honour.

616
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:33,737
I want you gone.
If you're in town tomorrow,

617
01:03:33,822 --> 01:03:37,897
I'm throwing your ass in jail
right next to Raven.

618
01:03:43,869 --> 01:03:48,021
Look, you did real good
rescuing her, Tom. You surprised me.

619
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:53,586
I didn't think you had it in you. Surprise
me again. Do something else real good.

620
01:03:53,674 --> 01:03:55,745
Be on that train tonight.

621
01:04:26,614 --> 01:04:28,651
- (knocking)
- Yeah, come in.

622
01:04:28,735 --> 01:04:31,808
Hey, I'll get it. Who is it?

623
01:04:31,897 --> 01:04:34,287
Oh...

624
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:40,652
- What the hell are you still doing here?
- I'll see you guys later, all right?

625
01:04:46,066 --> 01:04:50,301
I've been expecting you.
I know what you want. Ten grand.

626
01:04:50,389 --> 01:04:53,062
I'm as good as my word. I pay on time.

627
01:04:53,149 --> 01:04:57,350
You play rough, but you do a good job.
You should do a little more work for me.

628
01:04:57,433 --> 01:05:03,750
Then you'll realise I'm the one with
the brains here and you'll treat me nicer.

629
01:05:03,836 --> 01:05:07,513
Nobody had a hold on me the way you
did. I would have done anything for you.

630
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:13,633
A long time ago, I would have thought
you were worth it. Not any more, babe.

631
01:05:13,723 --> 01:05:17,558
Where do you get off talking to her
like that? She's way out of your league.

632
01:05:17,644 --> 01:05:21,559
This is the grand I promised McCoy.
You can keep the rest.

633
01:05:27,451 --> 01:05:31,526
You know what's wrong with that guy?
He's stupid.

634
01:05:32,734 --> 01:05:36,330
- Sorry, Billy.
- What? Where are you goin'?

635
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:42,097
Tom! Tom, wait! Tom!

636
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:44,330
Wait!

637
01:05:44,422 --> 01:05:48,541
What was I supposed to do? I hadn't heard
from you in two years, not even a letter.

638
01:05:48,623 --> 01:05:51,618
What did I do that was so wrong?

639
01:06:06,955 --> 01:06:11,075
You gotta go away. You've fought
enough fights. Let this one go.

640
01:06:11,158 --> 01:06:16,280
- With both of us gone...
- What do you mean, both of us?

641
01:06:16,361 --> 01:06:20,072
I want to go with you.
We could be together.

642
01:06:22,644 --> 01:06:27,323
- You'd really come along with me?
- In two seconds I would.

643
01:06:28,648 --> 01:06:30,445
Please?

644
01:06:55,585 --> 01:06:57,064
Well...

645
01:06:57,144 --> 01:07:00,343
- If it isn't my old pal Tom Cody.
- How's it going?

646
01:07:00,427 --> 01:07:04,308
Great till you got here.
I've been talking things over with Clyde.

647
01:07:04,389 --> 01:07:09,591
- Remember, he and I used to be close.
- Hey, Tom, tequila, right?

648
01:07:15,396 --> 01:07:17,275
There's what I owe you.

649
01:07:19,558 --> 01:07:24,681
You did real good back there.
I couldn't have got her out without you.

650
01:07:24,762 --> 01:07:27,323
Maybe I rode you a little harder
than I should have.

651
01:07:27,403 --> 01:07:32,479
Don't get sentimental on me.
I wouldn't know how to handle it.

652
01:07:44,374 --> 01:07:47,172
Hey, I got a problem with Ellen
I gotta talk to you about.

653
01:07:47,255 --> 01:07:52,047
I understand about these kind of things.
I was actually in love once myself.

654
01:07:52,137 --> 01:07:54,448
- Didn't work out.
- You make bad picks?

655
01:07:54,539 --> 01:07:57,816
He was the worst.
Lied to me all the time. Cheated on me.

656
01:07:57,902 --> 01:08:04,094
- If I run into him, I'll give him your best.
- That was before I was a soldier.

657
01:08:07,827 --> 01:08:12,299
- You're real crazy about Ellen, aren't you?
- I don't know. I guess I am.

658
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:15,145
Nothing wrong with it,
nothing to be embarrassed about.

659
01:08:15,232 --> 01:08:20,627
I ain't embarrassed. Ellen and I are going
in different directions. Nobody's fault.

660
01:08:20,715 --> 01:08:24,312
Maybe you're right. You don't look
like no backup singer to me.

661
01:08:24,396 --> 01:08:29,029
Look, I need your help tonight.
I gotta do something I don't want to do.

662
01:09:11,905 --> 01:09:16,662
- Come on.
- Tom? This is not the Bayside.

663
01:09:16,748 --> 01:09:19,139
There is something I gotta take care of.

664
01:09:20,712 --> 01:09:24,753
Get as far from here as you can.
Run until the Bayside. Hang out there.

665
01:09:24,834 --> 01:09:26,632
Sure, tough guy.

666
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:49,083
- When does this train take off?
- We don't.

667
01:09:49,168 --> 01:09:51,525
Lady, I gotta get moving. It's important.

668
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:54,842
You ain't gonna get there on this train.
Hey!

669
01:09:54,931 --> 01:09:58,483
- Maybe you better think about it.
- The Bombers have gone crazy.

670
01:09:58,575 --> 01:10:01,932
They're doing everything they can
to seal off the Richmond.

671
01:10:26,232 --> 01:10:28,029
Let's go.

672
01:10:42,121 --> 01:10:46,799
What the hell are you doing here, Clyde?
I told everybody to get off the streets.

673
01:10:46,884 --> 01:10:49,603
Yeah, but I wanna see
Raven run from up close.

674
01:10:49,684 --> 01:10:52,200
Just stay out of the way.

675
01:10:58,330 --> 01:11:00,639
- Well?
- Real simple.

676
01:11:00,731 --> 01:11:05,285
There's no showdown. Tom Cody
ain't here and neither is the girl.

677
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:10,131
- I don't get it.
- Get off your bike, Raven.

678
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:16,092
I ain't too crazy about jails, Chief.

679
01:11:17,621 --> 01:11:19,853
I got a better idea for you.

680
01:11:19,944 --> 01:11:21,740
(sounds horn)

681
01:11:36,432 --> 01:11:38,948
Holy shit!

682
01:11:44,318 --> 01:11:47,117
They're coming! They're here!

683
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:08,803
I told your friend Cody
I could get a lot of guns.

684
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:12,046
Get out of my way. What the hell?

685
01:12:12,135 --> 01:12:16,688
What is this? You think you can ride into
any town and kidnap anybody you want?

686
01:12:16,778 --> 01:12:19,656
Get the hell outta town
and leave these people alone.

687
01:12:45,956 --> 01:12:50,428
- Sorry I'm late.
- I got something special in mind.

688
01:12:50,518 --> 01:12:52,713
I brought them along just for you.

689
01:12:57,161 --> 01:12:59,916
Well, my plan went to shit.

690
01:13:00,003 --> 01:13:01,801
Let's see how you do.

691
01:13:05,126 --> 01:13:06,924
Kick his ass.

692
01:13:14,572 --> 01:13:16,644
(approaching voices)

693
01:13:17,213 --> 01:13:19,010
Come on, kill 'em!

694
01:13:33,303 --> 01:13:35,100
Nice, huh?

695
01:13:35,905 --> 01:13:37,862
(cheering)

696
01:13:45,152 --> 01:13:46,948
Kill him!

697
01:14:19,211 --> 01:14:21,203
Drop him!

698
01:14:21,292 --> 01:14:22,931
Kill him!

699
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,949
Tom!

700
01:16:01,352 --> 01:16:03,150
(cheering)

701
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:19,120
(wild cheering)

702
01:16:37,615 --> 01:16:39,809
Let's get outta here!

703
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:09,867
# No more timing
each tear that falls from my eyes

704
01:17:11,355 --> 01:17:18,948
# I'm not hiding the remedy
to cure this old heart of mine

705
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:25,642
# I can dream about you
if I can't hold you tonight

706
01:17:27,044 --> 01:17:28,717
# I can dream about you...

707
01:17:28,805 --> 01:17:30,603
You know something, Waldo?

708
01:17:30,686 --> 01:17:34,317
- We're gonna be rich.
- Yeah, long live rock'n'roll.

709
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:42,130
# I can dream about you
if I can't hold you tonight

710
01:17:43,854 --> 01:17:50,650
# I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right

711
01:17:52,139 --> 01:17:59,538
# Moving sidewalks
I don't see under my feet

712
01:18:00,864 --> 01:18:04,222
Great, huh? My new discovery.
I'll take them right up the ladder.

713
01:18:04,306 --> 01:18:08,063
Yeah, they oughtta make you
a lot of money, Fish.

714
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:14,901
Don't worry. I won't stand in your way
with Ellen. I know how it is between you.

715
01:18:14,992 --> 01:18:19,193
There's one thing we both know.
She needs you more than she needs me.

716
01:18:19,276 --> 01:18:23,065
- Yeah, she needs me but she loves you.
- She'll get over it.

717
01:18:23,158 --> 01:18:27,631
- She's used to me being unreliable.
- Is that what I'm supposed to tell her?

718
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:32,160
You're OK with words.
You'll make her feel better than I could.

719
01:18:34,446 --> 01:18:37,996
Take it easy, Cody. Thanks.

720
01:18:38,687 --> 01:18:41,487
I'll take it wherever I can get it.

721
01:18:45,132 --> 01:18:53,328
# Climbing up from the pain in my heart
cos it's you that I need

722
01:18:53,416 --> 01:18:55,214
(cheering)

723
01:19:01,021 --> 01:19:02,819
# I can dream

724
01:19:08,705 --> 01:19:10,185
# I can dream

725
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,544
Everybody!

726
01:19:17,031 --> 01:19:18,829
# Yes, I can dream

727
01:19:25,915 --> 01:19:31,709
# I don't understand it
I can't keep my mind off loving you

728
01:19:31,799 --> 01:19:34,109
# Not even for a minute

729
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,792
# Oh, now, baby

730
01:19:35,881 --> 01:19:41,675
# I'm caught up in the magic I see in you
There's one thing to do...

731
01:19:43,687 --> 01:19:46,122
I guess you're just gonna cut out, huh?

732
01:19:46,209 --> 01:19:50,249
- Yeah, you know me.
- Yeah, you're the guy with the right hook.

733
01:19:56,535 --> 01:20:00,006
Is that it? Is that all you have left to say?

734
01:20:01,217 --> 01:20:06,055
Look, I know you're gonna be
goin' places with your singing.

735
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:10,420
I'm not the kind of guy that will carry
any guitars around for you.

736
01:20:10,503 --> 01:20:14,862
But if you ever need me
for something, I'll be there.

737
01:20:18,388 --> 01:20:22,144
# I can dream about you

738
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:26,589
# I'm gonna press my lips
against you and hold you to me

739
01:20:26,672 --> 01:20:30,269
# I can dream about you

740
01:20:30,354 --> 01:20:34,590
# You know you've got me spellbound
What else can it be?

741
01:20:34,678 --> 01:20:36,475
# I can dream

742
01:20:38,439 --> 01:20:41,159
# Dreaming about you...

743
01:20:44,243 --> 01:20:46,234
(music ends' cheering)

744
01:21:15,382 --> 01:21:18,454
# I've got a dream about an angel
on the beach

745
01:21:18,543 --> 01:21:22,459
# And the perfect waves
are starting to come

746
01:21:23,786 --> 01:21:30,866
# His hair is flying out in ribbons of gold
and his touch has got the power to stun

747
01:21:31,992 --> 01:21:35,508
# I've got a dream
about an angel in the forest

748
01:21:35,594 --> 01:21:38,793
# Enchanted by the edge of a lake

749
01:21:40,277 --> 01:21:47,197
# His body's flowing in the jewels alive
and the earth below is starting to shake

750
01:21:47,962 --> 01:21:55,997
# But I don't see any angels in the city
I don't hear any holy choirs sing

751
01:21:56,085 --> 01:22:03,006
# And if I can't get an angel I can still get
a boy and a boy'd be the next best thing

752
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:06,481
# The next best thing to an angel

753
01:22:06,572 --> 01:22:09,691
# A boy'd be the next best thing

754
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:23,297
# I've got a dream about a boy in a castle
and he's dancing like the cat on the stairs

755
01:22:23,382 --> 01:22:29,655
# He's got the fire of a prince in his eyes
and the thunder of a drum in his ears

756
01:22:29,746 --> 01:22:36,019
# I've got a dream about a boy on a star
lookin' down upon the rim of the world

757
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:38,909
# He's there all alone
and dreamin' of someone like me

758
01:22:38,991 --> 01:22:42,031
# I'm not an angel but at least I'm a girl

759
01:22:43,115 --> 01:22:48,750
# I've got a dream when the darkness is
over, we'll be lyin' in the rays of the sun

760
01:22:48,839 --> 01:22:51,798
# But it's only a dream
and tonight is for real

761
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:57,560
# You'll never know what it means but
you'll know how it feels, it's gonna be over

762
01:22:57,644 --> 01:23:01,240

763

764

# Stop your cryin', hold on tonight
Before you know it, it's gone tonight

765

Tonight is what it means to be young

Hey, Cody,
how do you like my new wheels?

791
01:25:27,814 --> 01:25:32,526
I found it in the middle of the street.
Somebody dumped it. Finders keepers.

792
01:25:32,617 --> 01:25:37,170
- Maybe you need some company, huh?
- I don't mind if you tag along.

793
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:44,302
I guess this is my big chance, huh?

794
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:50,659
Cool down, big guy.
I already told you. You're not my type.

795
01:25:51,669 --> 01:25:53,341
# Let the fire be started

796
01:25:53,429 --> 01:25:57,141

798
01:26:00,032 --> 01:26:03,344
# Nothing's gonna stop us

# Then I see the edge, I look, I fall
