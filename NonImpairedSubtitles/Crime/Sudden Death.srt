around the ice.

that means?

a new one at the game.

Darren, you can't
just show up here

00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,610
and take them without
talking to me first.

93

You're back to work, Dad?

96
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,333
Your dad's a fire

97
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,830
It's very important work.

Kathi tells me
it's only temporary.

Are we going to the game?

103
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,056
Don't do this again.
I mean it.

104
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,556

the kids or me.

they don't get

Hi, Darren.
Are you working tonight?

135
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,215
Yeah, after I take
Tyler into the locker room.

136
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,256
Could you give
Emily a look at Icey?

137
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,215
Icey always loves company.
Come on, Emily,

138
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,183
I'm gonna show you
where Icey is, okay?

139
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,681
Icey. Big deal.

140
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,933
Some fat guy in
a ratty penguin suit.

141

That blonde
you're staring at,
she's the fat guy.

142
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,363
What's he doing?

143
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,607
Shaping the blade.

144
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,200
They're like horseshoes.
You get them hot enough,

145
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,027
you can bend them.

146
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,205
You recognize him?

147
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,204
TYLER: Yeah. Luc Robitaille.

148
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,831
He waved at me.

149
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,880
You see that, Dad?
Luc Robitaille waved at me.

150
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,548
Come on, I'll introduce you.
He won't bite.

did he say?

00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,233
He thinks they're
gonna win.

157

That's Brad Tolliver!

158

Dad, he doesn't
have a rocking chair.

159
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,109
A what?

160
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,782
My Dad said you
should be sitting
in a rocking chair,

161
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,984
instead of on the ice.

a 3-year-old little girl,

322
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:32,719
and his wife's pregnant.

323
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,925
I'll send a card.

324
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,179
What do you want?

325
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,852
What do I want?

326
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:41,269
World peace,
an end to bigotry
and no more mini-malls.

327
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,064
What am I gonna get?

328
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,111
And I am gonna get it.

329
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,990
That, boys and girls,
is really hot.

330
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,196
What is your objective?

331
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,614
My objective?

332
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:54,945
(SHUDDERS)

333
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,786
I get funny all over
when you talk like that.

334
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,871
I know just what
you're thinking.

335
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,669
Evaluate the situation,
calculate potential losses

336
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,337
and take appropriate action.

337
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,711
Let me do that for you.

338
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,042
The situation is hopeless.

339
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,378
The losses would
be unacceptable.

340
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,463
So the appropriate action
is for you to do nothing

341
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,219
and keep your
fucking mouth shut.

342
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,221

are you?

00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,474
The best kind.

You can keep calling me names
if it makes you feel better.

Throw me your
earpiece and your mic.

a center pass.

the back of his head.

They must be closed.

354

Oh, gross!

355
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,596
I have some work to do.

356
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,305
I'll be back
before the period ends.

357

You two,
stay right here.

I'll go, too,
so you'll have company.

Thanks, sweetheart,
but you stay with Tyler.

by yourself.

361
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,234
Thank you.

362
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,288
I mean it.
Don't leave your seats.

363

Oh! In case you want
a soda.

364
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,327
Don't get out of
your seats to get it.

365
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,127
We get the idea, Dad.

366
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,422
Hey, what's that?

367
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,212
Nothing.

368
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,057
What's Daddy gotta do?

369
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,189
Probably change
more light bulbs.

370
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,645
I thought you
said firemen don't do
that kind of stuff.

Dad's not really
a fireman anymore, Emily.

He walks into
the Chicago end.

Slap shot!
He shoots and scores!

375

Kevin Stevens
gives the Penguins
the opening goal.

(CROWD CH EERING)

Get in the fast lane,
Grandma.

378
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,713
The bingo game
is ready to roll.

to cry or wind his watch.

off Steve Smith,

the Chicago defenseman,
and finds the net.

386
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:39,952
MAN ON PA:... Pittsburgh goal,
his 1 1th in the play-offs,

387
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,822
scored by Number 25,

the Penguins
leading 1-0 in Game 7.

closer than we expected,
the hitting here,

394
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,422
early in the game,
has been ferocious.

395

If the smoke bothers anyone,
you can speak up.

396

There's no reason
to kill anyone else.

to be resistance

I won't kill any more people

everyone of my sincerity.

Will you make that
cow stop moaning?

407

What's that?
An invitation
to the White House.

408

It's nothing but
a bunch of numbers.

And they wonder why
this economy's so fucked up.

413
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,929
Those are the numbers
of 1 3 bank accounts
in five US banks

414
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,186
that belong to three
different countries
that our government

415
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,858
has frozen for
a variety of reasons.

416
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:58,356
They represent
a total deposit of
$1,700,000,000.

Christ,
it runs in the family.

418
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,908
During the course
of this game,

419
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,077
all that money is
going to be released

420
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,701
and transferred to
banks of my choice.

421
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:07,872
That's impossible.

422
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,208
At least
one-third of the money
must be moved

423
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,911
during each of
the three periods
of the game.

424
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,587
If, at the first
period's end,

425
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:17,291
the deposits are behind,
one of you will die.

426
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:19,377
If we're still lagging
at the end
of the second period,

427
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,460
two of you will die.

428
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:21,966
At the end of
the third period

429
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,547
everyone in this
building will die.

430
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:26,426
You have no idea
of the complexity...
I had an idea.

431
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,135
I had this idea,

432
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,313
and we are gonna
make it work or
we're gonna die trying.

433
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,985
You will call the President,
and on flash
precedence priority,

434
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,153
he will call
the Secretary of State

435
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,776
and Secretary
of the Treasury.

436
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:43,826
Then banks will be notified
and the money
will begin to move.

437
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,408
Or it won't.

438
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,408
And if it doesn't,
when the game ends,

439
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,081
everyone in this box
and in this arena will die

440
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,249
by explosion, fire and panic.

441
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,005
Enough bombs
have been planted
in this building

442
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,753
to stop all
the clocks in the hemisphere.

443

We messed up a few times
since I've been an agent,

01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:35,823
And I'm just hitting
the places that would cause

950
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,324
the most structural damage.

951
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:38,370
Third period started.

952
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:39,948
We've got
less than 20 minutes
and we're guessing.

953
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,159
Let's hope
I know what I'm doing.

954
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:48,624
Listen. My son is here, too.

955
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:52,302
If I can't get back to him,
he's sitting in D-1 0.

956
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,469
I'll be there.

957
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,595
Thanks.

958
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,638
Where are the rest
of your men?

959
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:03,389
Erom the Chicago end,
McEachern centers.

960
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:04,893
Belfour made the stop.

961
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,436
Straka with a quick shot.

962
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:09,065
Just missed the far post...

963
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:11,900
Now they're moving it.

964
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,731
Yeah, but where?
Check the codes.

965
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:16,860
$400 million to
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Madrid.

966
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:18,445
That's one
of the counter banks.

967
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,453
And $300 million
to Banco Popular,
Virgin Islands.

968
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:24,455
You know, these
transfers are being tracked,

969
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:27,458
no matter what happens here,
you'll never get
your hands on the money.

970
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:30,666
Not all of it.
The money will be transferred
again to 1 2 more banks.

971
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,876
I have arrangements with
the presidents of two.

972
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:34,051
So once it's transferred,

973
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:36,380
it's transferred
again and again,
all in a matter of minutes.

974
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,557
With each stop,
cash is
siphoned and rerouted,

975
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,805
some converted to
foreign currency,

976
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,099
some to
negotiable instruments.

977
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:47,557
Thanks to the incredibly vast
and complicated
world of banking

978
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,984
that our CIA uses
to such advantage,

979
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:54,656
about $500
million will be lost,
absorbed by the system.

980
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:58,910
And the other $1,200,000,000
is just a diversion.

981
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,534
I only wanted enough to
pay off my American Express.

982
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,831
You wouldn't be so generous
with that information

983
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:07,081
if you weren't planning
to kill everyone here.

984
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:11,793
I wonder who gets
the Cup if I blow up
the building

985
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:13,546
before the game is over.

986
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,297
(PHONE RINGING)

987
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:19,968
Yeah?

988
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:25,804
Not on the phone.
You know they've got
the frequency by now.

989
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,274
Don't go away.

990
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,113
MIKE: Taken away,
and McEachern hustling
down the right side.

991
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:40,159
Coming to the Chicago end.

992
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,737
Moves in towards the net.
A backhand shot, off target.

993
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:04,430
McCord's
disarming your bombs.

994
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:05,727
Is he guessing?

995
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,061
He's a pretty good
guesser.

996
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,604
Is he alone?
Yeah.

997
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,806
Why didn't you kill him?

998
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:13,610
'Cause two of your goons
started firing at us.
He ran off.

999
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:16,438
It was all I could do
to keep from getting
my own ass shot off.

1000
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:17,818
I want him.

1001
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:21,367
I would've had him if you
had a little more
control over your men.

1002
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,446
The only problem my men had
is they didn't hit what
they were shooting at.

1003
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:26,452
Look, I was there, too.

1004
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:30,914
Nice.

1005
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:35,840
I got the next best
thing to the fireman.

1006
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:38,043
He's got a little
boy here in the arena.

1007
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,294
I know where he's sitting.

1008
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:42,051
Bring him to me.

1009
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:45,554
I always wanted a son.

1010
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:51,730
MIKE: Greg Smyth
against Robitaille.

1011
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:53,649
Quick shot, save made!
Rebound.
Where's the puck?

1012
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,272
Bounces free.
Hawgood trying to tee it up.

1013
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:56,648
And stopped by Tolliver.

1014
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:01,908
Tyler?

1015
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:03,367
Yeah?

1016
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,240
Pretty exciting game, huh?

1017
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:07,868
How come you know my name?

1018
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:08,948
Your dad and I are friends.

1019
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,074
He asked me to
come and get you.

1020
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,251
He and your sister
got invited to sit
in the owner's box,

1021
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,374
way up there.

1022
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:18,083
Come on,
they got big soft chairs
and plenty to eat.

1023
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:22,011
My dad told me to stay here,
even if
the building fell down.

1024
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:25,340
Well if it did come down,
up there is
where you'd wanna be.

1025
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:26,595
Come on.

1026
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:29,598
I'm gonna stay here.

1027
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:32,897
I'm gonna be embarrassed
going back without you.

1028
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:36,984
Do you know my mom?

1029
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,562
No, but your dad's
invited me over
for dinner tomorrow night.

1030
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:42,774
My mom and dad
don't live together.

1031
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:44,279
He didn't mention that.

1032
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:45,822
He just said
bring you upstairs.

1033
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:47,699
Now don't you think,
you should do
what you're told?

1034
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:48,950
I am.

1035
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,375
Look,
I need you to come with me.

1036
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,040
I'm with the Secret Service.

1037
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,462
Come with me now.

1038
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:57,956
Come on! Down in front!

1039
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:01,509
I'll scream.

1040
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,048
I told you,
I'm with the Secret Service.

1041
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,255
And I'm a little kid.

1042
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,090
Hey, fella,
I didn't pay to watch you!

1043
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,012
Down in front!

1044
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,318
MIKE: Steve Smith
finds the lane.

1045
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:20,778
He'll skate ahead.

1046
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,696
Coming to the Penguin line.

1047
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,103
How many did you get?

1048
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:04,901
Four, so far.

1049
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:07,574
Is that all?
Christ, I'm just one guy.

1050
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:08,777
How many did you get?

1051
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:10,070
Just one.

1052
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,957
You are all alone,
aren't you?

1053
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:23,416
You must be real proud.

1054
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:24,921
I'm gonna be real rich.

1055
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:27,549
Now, very slowly,
I mean very slowly,

1056
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,926
pull your hands
out of your pockets.

1057
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,565
What are you
gonna do, drown me?

1058
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:41,025
No.

1059
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:44,733

(PHONE RINGS)

Yeah?
DARREN: Hallmark's dead.

1064
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:13,989
Who's this?

1065
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,071
Tom Castillo, Secret Service.

1066
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,247
Tom Castillo.

1067
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,744
How you doing, Tom?

1068
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:21,375
I hope you were
gentle with Hallmark.

1069
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:22,577
How many hostages

1070
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:24,128
besides the Vice President,
are still alive?

1071
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:26,456
Oh, now, that's
a personal question, Tom.

1072
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:28,416
Ever been
involved in an AOP, Tom?

1073
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,671
I didn't call
for conversation.

1074
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:31,010
How many are still alive?

1075
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,258
You'd probably
think I was lying,

1076
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:35,593
no matter what I
told you, so...

1077
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:39,177
I'm gonna let you talk
to a little friend of mine.

1078
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:43,522
Hello?

1079
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,525
Hello?
Emily.

1080
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,232
Don't let him know it's me.
I'll get you out.

1081
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:50,938
I'll take you home,
I promise.

1082
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,950
Look around and tell me
how many people are there.

1083
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,116
1 2.

1084
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:03,334
Well, now, wasn't that sweet?

1085
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:05,377
She included me, Tom.

1086
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:07,455
Now, you tell me
what an AOP is,

1087
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:09,583
or I'm gonna shoot
this cute little pumpkin.

1088
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:11,918
Listen to me. Listen good.

1089
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:15,255
If you touch her,
you look at her cross-eyed,
you lose.

1090
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:17,635
(LAUGHING) How do you
figure that, fireman?

1091
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:21,720
Okay, here's the game
and here are the rules.

1092
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:23,645
You've got hostages
and you've got your bombs,

1093
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,098
so you can get your money.

1094
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:28,810
I'm gonna try to stop you,
but I don't want
anyone to get hurt.

1095
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,315
You stop me, you win.

1096
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:31,899
I get your bombs, I win.

1097
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:34,607
That's the game
we're gonna play,
you piece of shit.

1098
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:36,533
Now, if you touch her,
the game's off.

1099
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:38,157
Then I'll come after you.

1100
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:41,410
You'll have to kill me
in front of everybody
in this arena.

1101
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,489
There will be panic.

1102
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:46,498
The Secret Service, SWAT,
the fucking navy will
have to come in here.

1103
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:47,871
Then you don't
get your money.

1104
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:49,167
You lose, pal.

1105
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:53,547
Well, that's not bad
for a civil servant.
Oh, by the way,

1106
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:56,175
in the Secret Service,
AOP is
an "assault on principle."

1107
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,802
In this case,
our esteemed Vice President.

1108
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:00,053
I don't give a shit.

1109
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:02,806
Ooh, now, Tom, come on.

1110
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:05,601
If we're gonna play,
you got to play nice.

1111
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,807
So you go run
your little ass off.

1112
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:09,984
I know where the bombs are,
so I know where you're going.

1113
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,652
Then come and get me.

1114
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:18,822
Would you like
a glass of wine
or a cigarette?

1115
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:22,701
It's customary to
offer these minor vices
to someone before they die.

1116
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:34,546
I'm not afraid of you.

1117
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:38,221
Sure you are.
I'm the scariest
person you've ever seen.

1118
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,797
You're the meanest.

1119
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,052
Am I, now?

1120
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,345
How do you
suppose I got that way?

1121
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:46,600
Maybe when you were born
you had something
wrong with your brain.

1122
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,393
Don't you know any
little boys like me?

1123
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,571
If there were
any at my school,
they'd get expelled.

1124
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:58,240
I can assure you
there are one or two.

1125
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,817
I'm gonna kill your daddy.

1126
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:01,652
What do you think about that?

1127
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,780
He promised
he'd take me home.

1128
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:06,786
He always does what he says.

1129
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,371
So do I.

1130
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:16,967
(LAUGHS)

1131
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:19,003
MIKE: We're in the third
period of this dramatic game.

1132
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:22,215
The Penguins on the rush.
Tamer brings it in.

1133
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:24,763
He puts it in!

1134
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,094
Ron Erancis!

1135
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:31,098
Oh, buy Sam a drink
and get his dog one, too!

1136
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,341
Chicago desperately
trying to get back
into this game.

1137
01:15:57,428 --> 01:15:59,840
Sutter cuts in
around the net,
fires and scores!

1138
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,137
Chicago does
get the third goal!

1139
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:03,631
PA UL: I tell you,
Mike, I don 't think

1140
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:05,637
Tolliver looks like
himself right now.

1141
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:07,059
I guess we shouldn 't
be surprised.

1142
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,762
He had a 1 04-degree
temperature earlier today.

1143
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:12,849
Right now,
he looks like he's struggling
in that goal for the Penguin.

1144
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:14,058
Yo, Ref.

1145
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:15,563
Right now,
he's calling for the referee.

1146
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:17,645
Looks like he might
wanna go to the bench.

1147
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,814
MIKE: Tolliver is
gonna head that way.

1148
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,945
Backup for
the Penguins is Ken Wregget.

1149
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:23,321
What's the matter?

1150
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:24,868
Coach,
I really feel like shit.

1151
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,536
I don't think I can goal.

1152
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:29,869
Go to the locker room.
Wregget!

1153
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,326
Get in there.
PLAYER: Let's go, Kenny.

1154
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:40,631
MAN ON PA: Now in goal
for Pittsburgh, Number 31,
Ken Wregget.

1155
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,631
(PHONE RINGS)

1156
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,518
Hey, fireman,
where are you?

1157
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:55,266
You don't call,
you don't write.

1158
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:56,817
I'm not far away.

1159
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:57,984
How many have you found?

1160
01:16:58,072 --> 01:16:59,528
How many what?

1161
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,571
I could detonate
all 1 0 right now.

1162
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:05,280
Go ahead. Then you lose.

1163
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:06,693
(BANGING)

1164
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:12,324
Nervous stomach, fireman?

1165
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:18,498
He's at number seven.
Get somebody there.

1166
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:29,050
Roberts cannot get it out.
Chelios in deep.

1167
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:31,219
A shot off the stick!

1168
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:38,942
Section B. Now.

1169
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:01,145
Chelios guns it
ahead to Bernie Nicholls.

1170
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,481
Here he comes! Look out!

1171
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,358
He shoots and scores!
Bernie Nicholls

1172
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:07,277
carried it into
the Penguins inn,

1173
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:09,108
coming right down the slot.

1174
01:19:09,203 --> 01:19:10,283
He wrapped a heavy slap shot.

1175
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,711
MIKE: An old-fashioned
shoot-out here

1176
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,831
at the Stanley
Cup competition.

1177
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:42,437
Up the alley,
now to center circle.

1178
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:44,484
Lines it up to the Penguins...

1179
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:45,936
Murphy plays to the board...

1180
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,692
He'll beat
the puck out of there.

1181
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,990
Leroux shakes his stick
because he wanted
that puck right there.

1182
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:52,159
Mike, they're making
some noise down here
in the corner

1183
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:54,282
and I'm not really
sure why.

1184
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:56,534
I don 't believe this.
Brad Tolliver is actually

1185
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:58,783
coming back into the game,
right now.

1186
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:00,583
MIKE: This is unbelievable.
This is a guy that once

1187
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:02,419
finished a game
with a broken ankle.

1188
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:09,918
Takes a lot of guts
to come back in at this

1189
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:11,920
point with
Chicago leading 4-3.

1190
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:13,763
They're on
the verge of winning

1191
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:15,632
their first
Stanley Cup since 1 960.

1192
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:18,640
Now he's just
sitting on the bench.

1193
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:21,605
Feeling better?

1194
01:20:22,276 --> 01:20:24,437
Then get the fuck in there.

1195
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,605
MIKE: And here he comes.

1196
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:36,495
MAN ON PA: Now back in goal
for Pittsburgh,

1197
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:41,451
Number 35, Brad Tolliver,
replacing Number 31,
Ken Wregget.

1198
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:44,253
PAUL: This is amazing.
I don't know what he did

1199
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:45,412
when he went to
the locker room,

1200
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,043
if he just recharged
his battery or what.

1201
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:48,962
But this is the guy
who was really sick

1202
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:51,260
and he's gonna go back in
and try to finish the game.

1203
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:53,053
I wonder if he
can he can make
the big saves to keep

1204
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,971
the Penguins from
within striking distance.

1205
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:58,927
One thing we do know,
he's got all summer
long to get better.

1206
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:01,182
There's Tolliver,
with the crowd here
at the Civic Arena,

1207
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,355
Iiterally crazy
on their feet.

1208
01:21:03,442 --> 01:21:05,228
Penguins looking
for a lift here

1209
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:07,147
to try and get
back into this game.

1210
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:09,023
Here we go!
Chicago will control

1211
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:10,987
the face-off and
they'll dump it quickly

1212
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:12,531
towards the Penguin end.

1213
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:14,149
DARREN : Stay down there.

1214
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:15,609
Oh, Christ.

1215
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:18,537
... and they drive it back
into Pittsburgh territory.

1216
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:20,497
And Chicago took the puck...

1217
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:24,410
... sweeps in,
they're trying
to get some Hawks

1218
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:26,791
and get the puck back,
and they do just that

1219
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:29,749
as they scramble now
and deliver up
the right side.

1220
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:31,299
PA UL: The Hawks are still
on the offense

1221
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:33,423
and Tolliver's not challenging
the shooters at all.

1222
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:35,129
He hasn 't challenged
much all night.

1223
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:37,589
Oh, shit.

1224
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:42,853
Move out!

1225
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:48,934
Move out!
God damn it, move out!

1226
01:21:49,029 --> 01:21:51,395
He's gonna come out.
He'll challenge.

1227
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:54,027
Tolliver hits his
head on the ice,

1228
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:55,733
and he's hurt,
but play continues.

1229
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:56,988
The puck gets free.

1230
01:21:57,079 --> 01:21:58,444
The Penguins
have command of it.

1231
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:04,787
And the Penguins
still trail by only one.

1232
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:10,418
Tolliver hit his head so hard
that his kids
will be born dizzy.

1233
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:20,307
This is Chicago
on the attack.

1234
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:38,400
(GRU NTS)

1235
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:52,631
What a save
by Brad Tolliver!

1236
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:54,379
That has to be
the save of the year!

1237
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:58,137
He ought to get five-to-ten
for robbing the Hawks on that

1238
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:00,179
to keep the Penguins
within a goal.

1239
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:02,724
What's amazing to me, Paul,
the fact that he's been sick.

1240
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,802
He didn 't challenge much
in this game tonight.

1241
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:07,684
Now all of a sudden,
he comes up with
the save of the year.

1242
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:11,187
No question about it,
that is his
biggest save ever.

1243
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:39,678
Tolliver makes
a little move out,
in front of the net.

1244
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:41,721
What's he doing?

1245
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:44,265
He just slammed Dubinsky!

1246
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,927
T olliver,
what the fuck are you doing?

1247
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:50,480
He gave him a right cross
and knocked him down.

1248
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:53,434
He's gonna get
a game misconduct and a fine.

1249
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:55,110
He's put his
team shorthanded.

1250
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:56,820
The Penguins now,
are really in the hole.

1251
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:58,067
I don't believe this.

1252
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,406
PAUL: This has been
a strange night for Tolliver.

1253
01:23:59,493 --> 01:24:00,778
I don 't know what
he's up to, Mike.

1254

hold on to a 4-3 lead.

topple Chicago again.

Cullen of the Penguins

Naslund shoots,
and he's stopped by Belfour.

for the parade
down Michigan Avenue.
