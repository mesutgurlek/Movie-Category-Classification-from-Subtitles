1
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:26,997  X1:192 X2:507 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Got a present for you.
- Who is it?

2
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,002  X1:229 X2:472 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Sammy.
- Sammy the Bull?

3
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,004  X1:133 X2:568 Y1:418 Y2:449
Sammy the Knife. I diced him up.

4
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,508  X1:163 X2:539 Y1:418 Y2:449
Did you clean him? Ah, man !

5
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,569  X1:101 X2:601 Y1:382 Y2:449
You're coming back for this weekend?
All right. Good luck.

6
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:07,833  X1:101 X2:601 Y1:418 Y2:449
Damn, Vince. Cheap, leaky bags! Shit!

7
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:24,957  X1:321 X2:381 Y1:418 Y2:445
Shit!

8
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,027  X1:160 X2:541 Y1:418 Y2:449
You've looked better, Sammy.

9
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:08,526  X1:176 X2:528 Y1:418 Y2:449
Hey, baby, how you doing?

10
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:13,500  X1:119 X2:583 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Can I ask an important question?
- Sure.

11
00:02:13,574 --> 00:02:16,441  X1:190 X2:513 Y1:382 Y2:449
Where directly the fuck
have you been all week?

12
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,739  X1:293 X2:406 Y1:418 Y2:449
Working.

13
00:02:17,812 --> 00:02:20,212  X1:117 X2:585 Y1:418 Y2:449
Looks like your ass is still working.

14
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:23,216  X1:145 X2:558 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'm doing a favor for Vince.
He got that thing this weekend.

15
00:02:23,284 --> 00:02:25,718  X1:219 X2:484 Y1:382 Y2:445
Melvin, you're doing
this shit for free!

16
00:02:25,787 --> 00:02:28,119  X1:168 X2:535 Y1:382 Y2:449
You have a mortgage to pay
and my car note!

17
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,625  X1:175 X2:529 Y1:382 Y2:449
Did you see these notices?
Will you look at this shit?

18
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:37,428  X1:099 X2:602 Y1:382 Y2:449
Take care of your responsibilities
instead of doing favors for coworkers!

19
00:02:37,498 --> 00:02:40,433  X1:151 X2:550 Y1:418 Y2:449
You're down at least 25 grand.

20
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:43,265  X1:214 X2:487 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Twenty-five grand?
- Yeah, baby!

21
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:47,330  X1:123 X2:578 Y1:382 Y2:449
- How did that happen?
- That's considering the mortgage.

22
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:54,111  X1:216 X2:484 Y1:418 Y2:449
The note on my Jag.

23
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,277  X1:170 X2:530 Y1:418 Y2:449
And all the other expenses.

24
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,553  X1:158 X2:545 Y1:418 Y2:445
He's kinda cute. Who is that?

25
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,428  X1:192 X2:507 Y1:382 Y2:445
That's Sammy the Knife,
one of Costanzo's crew.

26
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:15,502  X1:203 X2:497 Y1:418 Y2:445
That shit turns me off.

27
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,768  X1:091 X2:608 Y1:382 Y2:449
Vince is gonna be here on Saturday
to pick him up so I'm leaving him here.

28
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:22,605  X1:122 X2:579 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Are you going out this weekend?
- Maybe.

29
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:25,976  X1:193 X2:509 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Where's your fiancee?
- All right. Shit!

30
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:35,741  X1:100 X2:600 Y1:382 Y2:449
- You trying to clown me?
- I'm serious, dog. I've seen the light.

31
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,809  X1:183 X2:520 Y1:382 Y2:449
Check out the six-pack!
Looking kinda diesel, kid.

32
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:41,548  X1:193 X2:511 Y1:382 Y2:449
I get my workout swerve
on six days a week.

33
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:47,117  X1:102 X2:599 Y1:382 Y2:449
You telling me you never jerked
your dick in your life until last week?

34
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:49,629  X1:217 X2:483 Y1:418 Y2:449
That's bullshit, man.

35
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:52,097  X1:233 X2:470 Y1:418 Y2:445
I never needed to.

36
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,999  X1:131 X2:572 Y1:418 Y2:449
I've been fucking since I was ten.

37
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:57,094  X1:224 X2:478 Y1:418 Y2:445
I can relate to that.

38
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,900  X1:273 X2:428 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Cisco!
- Cisco, yo.

39
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:02,272  X1:112 X2:589 Y1:382 Y2:449
I can't wear green. Clashes with
my eyes. Look good on you, though.

40
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,743  X1:215 X2:485 Y1:382 Y2:449
Bust a move, man.
We're gonna be late.

41
00:05:04,812 --> 00:05:07,280  X1:100 X2:601 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Shit. Yo, Vinnie, you hear the news?
- What's that?

42
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:12,115  X1:102 X2:599 Y1:380 Y2:449
This fool claim he don't bone females
since he discovered wringing his rag.

43
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:16,054  X1:117 X2:584 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Is that true?
- No doubt. It's lower maintenance.

44
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:22,122  X1:101 X2:598 Y1:418 Y2:449
Mel is like me. He loves to bump bag.

45
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,188  X1:151 X2:552 Y1:418 Y2:449
He's got fwo of fhe sweefest--

46
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:30,033  X1:125 X2:578 Y1:382 Y2:449
If anybody needs to make a switch
to straight jacking, it's Mel.

47
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:33,232  X1:135 X2:565 Y1:382 Y2:449
Both of them chickenheads
is takin' my man to the cleaners.

48
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:35,241  X1:227 X2:475 Y1:418 Y2:449
Especially Chantel.

49
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:40,713  X1:089 X2:611 Y1:382 Y2:449
The way I see it, with the loot I saved
and the money I'll clock this weekend...

50
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:43,807  X1:094 X2:608 Y1:382 Y2:449
I should be able to put the final
payment down on that Grande Pinoche.

51
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,548  X1:139 X2:563 Y1:382 Y2:449
Sail that baby around the world!
Can you imagine that?

52
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:51,718  X1:140 X2:563 Y1:418 Y2:445
Damn Caribbean. Mediterranean.

53
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:53,851  X1:274 X2:428 Y1:418 Y2:445
South Seas.

54
00:05:53,928 --> 00:05:55,361  X1:261 X2:441 Y1:418 Y2:449
Sounds great.

55
00:05:57,632 --> 00:06:00,965  X1:091 X2:611 Y1:382 Y2:449
You need to get in on that weekend job
with me, Crunch and Gump.

56
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:04,664  X1:143 X2:557 Y1:382 Y2:449
- We could use a fourth.
- I got that thing this weekend.

57
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,436  X1:129 X2:571 Y1:382 Y2:449
Oh, well.
All right, gentlemen, synchronize.

58
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,674  X1:175 X2:526 Y1:382 Y2:445
- You know the drill, baby.
- Word is bond.

59
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:28,455  X1:191 X2:509 Y1:382 Y2:445
As agreed.
Three blondes under 20.

60
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:31,980  X1:198 X2:505 Y1:418 Y2:445
Midwestern. No tattoos.

61
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:34,687  X1:192 X2:508 Y1:382 Y2:449
- How much?
- Fifty thousand apiece.

62
00:07:34,762 --> 00:07:36,195  X1:251 X2:453 Y1:418 Y2:449
Fifty thousand?

63
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,788  X1:280 X2:422 Y1:418 Y2:445
Fuck them.

64
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,694  X1:194 X2:507 Y1:418 Y2:449
Get ready in five, four...

65
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:11,664  X1:247 X2:453 Y1:418 Y2:449
three, two, one.

66
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:21,700  X1:321 X2:381 Y1:418 Y2:445
Shit!

67
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:24,538  X1:231 X2:469 Y1:418 Y2:449
All right, all right.

68
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:27,376  X1:263 X2:439 Y1:418 Y2:449
In five, four...

69
00:08:27,448 --> 00:08:29,211  X1:303 X2:399 Y1:418 Y2:445
three--

70
00:08:34,355 --> 00:08:34,388  X1:277 X2:423 Y1:418 Y2:449
Ah, go, go!

71
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,822  X1:277 X2:423 Y1:418 Y2:449
Ah, go, go!

72
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:39,946  X1:094 X2:607 Y1:382 Y2:449
-It's getting thick here! I need backup!
- We gof incoming.

73
00:09:41,722 --> 00:09:43,986  X1:129 X2:571 Y1:418 Y2:449
We'll hold 'em back for you, man !

74
00:09:44,058 --> 00:09:46,788  X1:222 X2:478 Y1:418 Y2:449
They're backing off.

75
00:09:49,263 --> 00:09:52,528  X1:101 X2:600 Y1:382 Y2:449
With the bonus from today's hit, and
the chips from this weekend's caper...

76
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,125  X1:194 X2:509 Y1:382 Y2:449
I should be able to take
about a year off.

77
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:57,136  X1:219 X2:482 Y1:418 Y2:445
This is a bonus hit?

78
00:09:57,204 --> 00:10:00,037  X1:124 X2:579 Y1:382 Y2:449
Without a doubt. Twenty-five large
to whoever clip the big man.

79
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:02,837  X1:216 X2:486 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Nondairy creamer?
- Yeah.

80
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,310  X1:230 X2:471 Y1:382 Y2:445
- What happened?
- Get off!

81
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,262  X1:303 X2:398 Y1:418 Y2:449
Go, go!

82
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:10,209  X1:214 X2:488 Y1:418 Y2:449
Are you ladies okay?

83
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,271  X1:145 X2:558 Y1:418 Y2:449
I'm really sorry about the mess.

84
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:16,615  X1:227 X2:474 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Time to get paid.
- Yes, sir.

85
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:25,720  X1:149 X2:551 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Take a piece of this!
- That's what we talkin' about!

86
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:27,420  X1:279 X2:421 Y1:418 Y2:449
Yeah, man !

87
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,563  X1:229 X2:471 Y1:418 Y2:449
We fucked 'em up!

88
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:35,596  X1:256 X2:444 Y1:418 Y2:445
You're so fine.

89
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:39,230  X1:089 X2:613 Y1:382 Y2:449
I wanna pour milk on you and make you
part of my complete breakfast!

90
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:41,774  X1:127 X2:574 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Baby, you got a number for me?
- 911 !

91
00:11:41,842 --> 00:11:45,403  X1:157 X2:544 Y1:382 Y2:449
Come on, fellas, we gotta go!
Quit wasting your time.

92
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:48,676  X1:185 X2:517 Y1:382 Y2:449
We better find Mel
before he gets my bonus.

93
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,081  X1:239 X2:461 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Damn lesbians.
- Come on.

94
00:11:56,023 --> 00:11:58,184  X1:155 X2:548 Y1:382 Y2:449
Cisco, where the fuck you at?
I need backup!

95
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,284  X1:129 X2:572 Y1:418 Y2:449
We'll hold 'em back for you, baby.

96
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,123  X1:109 X2:592 Y1:382 Y2:449
- I'm outta here!
- protect me, I'm paying you double!

97
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,532  X1:173 X2:530 Y1:418 Y2:449
I can't spend it if I'm dead!

98
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:09,020  X1:298 X2:403 Y1:418 Y2:445
Bastard.

99
00:13:46,533 --> 00:13:46,567  X1:160 X2:540 Y1:382 Y2:449
Shit! Cisco, Vince, Crunch,
we gotta get outta here now!

100
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:49,434  X1:160 X2:540 Y1:382 Y2:449
Shit! Cisco, Vince, Crunch,
we gotta get outta here now!

101
00:14:51,865 --> 00:14:55,323  X1:122 X2:579 Y1:418 Y2:449
Good work, good work, good work.

102
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:57,836  X1:282 X2:418 Y1:418 Y2:449
Okay, Mel!

103
00:14:57,905 --> 00:15:01,864  X1:148 X2:556 Y1:382 Y2:445
Looks like you owe me $25,000
in cash advances.

104
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,172  X1:189 X2:513 Y1:382 Y2:445
Your commission
should take care of that.

105
00:15:04,244 --> 00:15:07,941  X1:208 X2:493 Y1:382 Y2:449
But the good news is,
here's your bonus.

106
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:09,710  X1:253 X2:446 Y1:418 Y2:449
Thank you, sir.

107
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:15,048  X1:212 X2:490 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Mel got the bonus?
- What?

108
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:18,785  X1:160 X2:542 Y1:382 Y2:449
Yo, yo, yo. Vince,
that guy was still alive, huh?

109
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:20,451  X1:249 X2:453 Y1:418 Y2:449
Extremely alive.

110
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:21,960  X1:321 X2:381 Y1:418 Y2:445
Shit!

111
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:27,698  X1:140 X2:560 Y1:382 Y2:445
- I'm the one who clipped him.
- I don't think so. He was dead.

112
00:15:27,768 --> 00:15:31,363  X1:155 X2:547 Y1:418 Y2:449
Okay. Sure, whatever you say.

113
00:15:31,438 --> 00:15:33,804  X1:175 X2:528 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'm wrong and you're right.
I'm lying.

114
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:37,002  X1:115 X2:587 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'm just trying to beat you
out of your hard-earned bonus, pal.

115
00:15:37,077 --> 00:15:39,045  X1:233 X2:470 Y1:418 Y2:449
My kill, my bonus.

116
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:41,979  X1:188 X2:516 Y1:382 Y2:449
If you say you're the one
who clipped him...

117
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:43,983  X1:162 X2:537 Y1:418 Y2:449
who am I to say you didn't...

118
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:48,687  X1:280 X2:423 Y1:418 Y2:445
old friend?

119
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:04,203  X1:173 X2:528 Y1:418 Y2:449
You're an honest man, Mel.

120
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:07,468  X1:159 X2:545 Y1:382 Y2:449
Don't think I don't appreciate
that shit, baby.

121
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:11,841  X1:146 X2:556 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'll tell you what. To show you
how much love I gots for you...

122
00:16:11,912 --> 00:16:14,779  X1:215 X2:487 Y1:418 Y2:449
if anything were to...

123
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:18,443  X1:177 X2:522 Y1:418 Y2:449
you know, happen to me...

124
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,421  X1:192 X2:508 Y1:418 Y2:449
you could take my boat.

125
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:26,550  X1:099 X2:603 Y1:382 Y2:449
- How'd that be? ls that love or what?
- I guess.

126
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:28,857  X1:185 X2:517 Y1:418 Y2:449
You getting lonely, baby?

127
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:31,363  X1:129 X2:572 Y1:418 Y2:449
Ah, yes, Daddy loves both of you.

128
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,134  X1:229 X2:472 Y1:382 Y2:445
That motherfucker.
Shit!

129
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,567  X1:310 X2:391 Y1:418 Y2:445
What?

130
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:41,097  X1:083 X2:619 Y1:382 Y2:449
Mel, you sure you don't wanna get in on
this caper we got planned for tomorrow?

131
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:45,338  X1:158 X2:544 Y1:382 Y2:445
That's like moonlighting.
Paris will kill us for that shit.

132
00:16:45,412 --> 00:16:48,438  X1:186 X2:515 Y1:382 Y2:449
You're too honest
for your own good, baby.

133
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:07,457  X1:160 X2:540 Y1:418 Y2:449
Wrong house again, asshole!

134
00:17:07,534 --> 00:17:08,967  X1:313 X2:388 Y1:418 Y2:449
Sorry.

135
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:51,936  X1:311 X2:393 Y1:418 Y2:445
Hello?

136
00:17:52,012 --> 00:17:55,607  X1:193 X2:507 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Melvin Smiley, please.
- This is he.

137
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:57,775  X1:182 X2:520 Y1:418 Y2:449
Mr. Smiley, Big Top Video.

138
00:17:57,851 --> 00:18:03,153  X1:080 X2:624 Y1:382 Y2:445
You've had our copy of "King Kong Lives"
for over two weeks.

139
00:18:03,223 --> 00:18:07,489  X1:177 X2:524 Y1:382 Y2:449
Return it immediately
or we will have you killed!

140
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:08,823  X1:316 X2:384 Y1:418 Y2:445
Yeah.

141
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,689  X1:218 X2:486 Y1:418 Y2:449
Hon, how you doin'?

142
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:16,566  X1:081 X2:620 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Fine. Seen my "King Kong Lives" tape?
- No, haven't seen it.

143
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,575  X1:188 X2:517 Y1:382 Y2:449
Mel, do you think my ass
is still perky?

144
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:26,739  X1:120 X2:579 Y1:382 Y2:449
- As a matter of fact--
- Go ahead, just give it a squeeze.

145
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:29,543  X1:164 X2:538 Y1:418 Y2:449
Let me know what you think.

146
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:31,846  X1:248 X2:455 Y1:418 Y2:449
Is it still perky?

147
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:35,319  X1:195 X2:505 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Is it firm, yet pliable?
- Like a teenager.

148
00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:39,723  X1:188 X2:514 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Is this turning you on?
- Like a light switch.

149
00:18:39,793 --> 00:18:43,229  X1:092 X2:608 Y1:382 Y2:449
- You know what I think we should do?
- What do you think we should do?

150
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:46,390  X1:184 X2:519 Y1:382 Y2:449
Invite Mom and Dad down
for the holiday weekend.

151
00:18:46,466 --> 00:18:48,798  X1:097 X2:603 Y1:382 Y2:449
Actually, they're already coming down.
They're gonna be here tomorrow.

152
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:51,337  X1:212 X2:489 Y1:382 Y2:449
I figured we'd all
have dinner together.

153
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:54,397  X1:198 X2:506 Y1:382 Y2:449
I think this is gonna be
a great opportunity...

154
00:18:54,474 --> 00:18:56,840  X1:138 X2:562 Y1:418 Y2:449
for you and my parents to bond.

155
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:01,438  X1:103 X2:597 Y1:382 Y2:449
I also think that this will be the
right time to tell them we're engaged.

156
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:05,383  X1:104 X2:595 Y1:382 Y2:449
- You haven't told them yet?
- I've been waiting for the right time.

157
00:19:05,452 --> 00:19:08,546  X1:132 X2:570 Y1:382 Y2:449
You've got to break things gently
to my parents.

158
00:19:08,622 --> 00:19:12,524  X1:084 X2:617 Y1:382 Y2:449
What do you mean? It was almost a year
before you told them I wasn't Jewish.

159
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:17,124  X1:166 X2:537 Y1:382 Y2:449
Technically, they don't know
you're not Jewish.

160
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:20,956  X1:183 X2:519 Y1:418 Y2:449
Honey, it's gonna be fine.

161
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:24,367  X1:187 X2:518 Y1:382 Y2:449
I fixed things between us
just yesterday.

162
00:19:24,438 --> 00:19:26,770  X1:176 X2:524 Y1:418 Y2:449
They are gonna love you...

163
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,276  X1:158 X2:543 Y1:382 Y2:449
just as soon as they get over
the whole goyim factor.

164
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:33,312  X1:198 X2:503 Y1:382 Y2:449
What makes you think
they're gonna love me?

165
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,747  X1:075 X2:629 Y1:382 Y2:445
Remember when I told you Dad's business
was in trouble with the l.R.S.?

166
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:38,614  X1:288 X2:413 Y1:418 Y2:449
Yeah, so?

167
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:42,382  X1:157 X2:544 Y1:382 Y2:449
He was unable to get a loan
because of Mom's gambling...

168
00:19:42,456 --> 00:19:45,254  X1:199 X2:504 Y1:382 Y2:449
and her plastic surgery
and everything, right?

169
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:47,759  X1:158 X2:545 Y1:382 Y2:449
Are you still having problems
with your stomach?

170
00:19:47,828 --> 00:19:50,296  X1:139 X2:563 Y1:418 Y2:449
I told you about that spicy food.

171
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:56,097  X1:093 X2:608 Y1:382 Y2:449
Anyway, I took the $50,000 we had in
our savings account and lent it to Dad.

172
00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:01,436  X1:095 X2:605 Y1:382 Y2:449
With as much money as we make, we'll
be fine until they get on their feet.

173
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,312  X1:157 X2:542 Y1:418 Y2:449
I can't believe that this guy...

174
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:12,044  X1:163 X2:537 Y1:418 Y2:449
will give you 25 grand more.

175
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:15,555  X1:187 X2:515 Y1:382 Y2:445
We've already got 50,000
out of this clown.

176
00:20:15,622 --> 00:20:17,954  X1:134 X2:568 Y1:418 Y2:449
He thinks I'm paying my bills off.

177
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:20,618  X1:116 X2:585 Y1:418 Y2:449
What? You're not paying your bills?

178
00:20:20,694 --> 00:20:22,628  X1:202 X2:501 Y1:418 Y2:449
Hell no! Why should l?

179
00:20:22,696 --> 00:20:25,256  X1:119 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:449
Let his fucking fiancee pay 'em off.

180
00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:32,972  X1:305 X2:399 Y1:418 Y2:449
Honey?

181
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,132  X1:235 X2:466 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Are you awake?
- Yeah.

182
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:38,609  X1:186 X2:518 Y1:382 Y2:449
Melvin, I'm really starting
to dislike you.

183
00:20:38,678 --> 00:20:41,169  X1:201 X2:502 Y1:418 Y2:449
I didn't find my money!

184
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,446  X1:221 X2:480 Y1:418 Y2:449
You all right, babe?

185
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,923  X1:316 X2:384 Y1:418 Y2:445
Yeah.

186
00:21:03,036 --> 00:21:05,527  X1:154 X2:549 Y1:418 Y2:449
Hello? Cisco, what's up, man?

187
00:21:05,605 --> 00:21:07,596  X1:219 X2:482 Y1:418 Y2:449
Mel, what's u,, kid?

188
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:12,236  X1:095 X2:606 Y1:382 Y2:449
That thing you got goin' for tomorrow?
Can I still get in?

189
00:21:19,186 --> 00:21:20,380  X1:276 X2:423 Y1:418 Y2:449
Yo, Gump...

190
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:23,149  X1:197 X2:508 Y1:382 Y2:449
I don't want no fuckups
on this kidnapping.

191
00:21:23,223 --> 00:21:28,251  X1:124 X2:578 Y1:382 Y2:449
Come on. I ain't like that no more!
You know I gots my shit--

192
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,262  X1:104 X2:596 Y1:418 Y2:449
Together. You gots your shit together.

193
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,855  X1:170 X2:532 Y1:382 Y2:445
You non-word-remembering
motherfucker.

194
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:36,334  X1:183 X2:521 Y1:382 Y2:449
Cisco, I don't know about
no kidnapping shit.

195
00:21:36,403 --> 00:21:39,804  X1:180 X2:519 Y1:382 Y2:445
- A hundred large apiece.
- A hundred?

196
00:21:39,873 --> 00:21:42,603  X1:249 X2:454 Y1:382 Y2:445
Word up.
Here's the deal.

197
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:46,407  X1:095 X2:607 Y1:382 Y2:445
There's this rich Japanese industrialist
named Jiro Nishi.

198
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:49,471  X1:181 X2:519 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Nishi Electric?
- The one and only, baby.

199
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:52,575  X1:083 X2:617 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Richest motherfucker on the seaboard.
- How do you know he's gonna pay?

200
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:59,588  X1:109 X2:592 Y1:382 Y2:449
You're starting to sound like a bitch.
"How do you know he's gonna pay?"

201
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:03,252  X1:195 X2:507 Y1:418 Y2:449
I gots this shit covered.

202
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,595  X1:100 X2:603 Y1:382 Y2:449
That motherfucker Nishi's got millions
in cash laying around his crib.

203
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,066  X1:169 X2:532 Y1:418 Y2:445
This motherfucker's loaded!

204
00:22:09,135 --> 00:22:11,626  X1:167 X2:536 Y1:418 Y2:449
It was a legitimate question.

205
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:22,481  X1:196 X2:505 Y1:382 Y2:449
Thaf's it, Mr. Nishi.
You are officially broke.

206
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,211  X1:176 X2:529 Y1:382 Y2:449
Everything. How could this
have happened?

207
00:22:25,285 --> 00:22:30,416  X1:128 X2:573 Y1:382 Y2:449
You knew the market was bearish.
It was risky making that movie.

208
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:35,393  X1:162 X2:540 Y1:382 Y2:449
All my life, I wanted to make
a big Hollywood movie!

209
00:22:35,462 --> 00:22:40,525  X1:095 X2:609 Y1:382 Y2:449
I understand. "Taste The Golden Spray"
was a big movie, a huge movie.

210
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,501  X1:158 X2:543 Y1:382 Y2:449
Actually, it was
the biggest movie ever made.

211
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,199  X1:124 X2:579 Y1:382 Y2:445
Maybe you shouldn't have directed
and starred in it.

212
00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:50,107  X1:201 X2:502 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'm not the first person
to make big movie.

213
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:55,614  X1:119 X2:581 Y1:382 Y2:449
I know. But gold leaf posters
for everybody? That was excessive.

214
00:22:55,682 --> 00:22:59,083  X1:154 X2:551 Y1:382 Y2:449
I need to pick up my daughter
at college.

215
00:22:59,152 --> 00:23:01,086  X1:318 X2:383 Y1:418 Y2:445
And?

216
00:23:01,154 --> 00:23:03,714  X1:149 X2:553 Y1:418 Y2:449
I can't afford to pay the driver.

217
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,851  X1:169 X2:534 Y1:382 Y2:449
For crying out loud!
How much is it gonna cost?

218
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,925  X1:232 X2:470 Y1:418 Y2:445
It's a stretch limo.

219
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:14,967  X1:271 X2:430 Y1:418 Y2:445
Stretch this.

220
00:23:15,035 --> 00:23:18,471  X1:268 X2:435 Y1:382 Y2:445
Fuck ass no!
Hell no!

221
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:21,769  X1:118 X2:582 Y1:382 Y2:449
No advances. I've got my chips
wrapped up in the Grande pinoche.

222
00:23:21,841 --> 00:23:23,934  X1:136 X2:564 Y1:418 Y2:449
Ask Crunch. He's got spare loot.

223
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,673  X1:184 X2:517 Y1:382 Y2:449
He don't spend it on shit
except maybe some smut.

224
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:32,612  X1:160 X2:543 Y1:382 Y2:445
Can you hook me with 25 g's
until we do this?

225
00:23:32,686 --> 00:23:36,622  X1:143 X2:559 Y1:382 Y2:449
You need it for that
sell-out bitch again, don't you?

226
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,954  X1:180 X2:520 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Who's a bitch?
- Get the fuck outta here.

227
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:44,263  X1:208 X2:492 Y1:418 Y2:449
Get with the program.

228
00:23:44,331 --> 00:23:48,062  X1:182 X2:519 Y1:382 Y2:445
Straight jackin' saves you
that mad cream.

229
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:50,659  X1:293 X2:408 Y1:418 Y2:449
Oh, well.

230
00:23:50,737 --> 00:23:53,399  X1:145 X2:556 Y1:382 Y2:449
Give me a call at the crib later.
I'll hook you up.

231
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,306  X1:198 X2:504 Y1:418 Y2:449
Good looking out, man.

232
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,873  X1:099 X2:604 Y1:382 Y2:445
I don't know why I'm encouraging you.
Fuck both them bitches.

233
00:24:00,947 --> 00:24:03,108  X1:096 X2:604 Y1:382 Y2:449
If they're running you through
that much shit, dump both their asses.

234
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:06,482  X1:155 X2:546 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Where the hell is that limo?
- I can't, man.

235
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:09,021  X1:140 X2:562 Y1:382 Y2:449
- What do you mean, you can't?
- I just can't. Okay?

236
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:11,489  X1:169 X2:531 Y1:382 Y2:449
How the fuck come
you can't dump these two...

237
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:14,527  X1:161 X2:538 Y1:382 Y2:449
whack-ass, money-grubbing,
no-respect-giving bitches?

238
00:24:14,594 --> 00:24:16,323  X1:192 X2:508 Y1:382 Y2:449
- The truth?
- Yeah, I want the truth.

239
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:18,694  X1:200 X2:500 Y1:418 Y2:445
You can't handle truth!

240
00:24:18,765 --> 00:24:20,699  X1:236 X2:465 Y1:418 Y2:449
Shut the fuck up!

241
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:24,362  X1:128 X2:573 Y1:382 Y2:449
The truth is I can't stand the idea
of them not liking me anymore.

242
00:24:24,437 --> 00:24:27,873  X1:095 X2:607 Y1:382 Y2:449
The idea of those two women
not liking me is more than I can stand.

243
00:24:27,941 --> 00:24:31,274  X1:139 X2:564 Y1:382 Y2:449
I can't stand the idea
of anybody not liking me. Okay?

244
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,336  X1:176 X2:524 Y1:382 Y2:445
There, I said it.
The truth. That's the truth.

245
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,710  X1:284 X2:419 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Yo, Mel?
- What?

246
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:47,488  X1:086 X2:614 Y1:382 Y2:449
The hundred or so people you murdered
in the past five years...

247
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,496  X1:126 X2:574 Y1:382 Y2:449
more than likely have relatives
who don't think too highly of you.

248
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,503  X1:271 X2:429 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Hello?
- Hey, baby.

249
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:07,239  X1:115 X2:587 Y1:382 Y2:449
- What's up, girl?
- You know why I called, don'f you?

250
00:25:07,313 --> 00:25:10,111  X1:210 X2:493 Y1:382 Y2:449
I don't know.
Why did you call me?

251
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:14,620  X1:165 X2:536 Y1:382 Y2:449
Because, Melvin,

252
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:17,383  X1:115 X2:586 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Why do you always procrasfinate?
- Stand up to her, Mel.

253
00:25:17,457 --> 00:25:22,417  X1:214 X2:488 Y1:382 Y2:449
Melvin, why are you

254
00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:25,055  X1:270 X2:432 Y1:418 Y2:445
Car trouble?

255

Puf thaf damn phone fo your ear.

256
00:25:29,302 --> 00:25:31,964  X1:155 X2:548 Y1:418 Y2:449
Mel, show her you're the man.

257
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:35,201  X1:180 X2:522 Y1:382 Y2:449
Whaf are you doing?

258
00:25:35,275 --> 00:25:37,038  X1:240 X2:460 Y1:418 Y2:449
You are ,afhefic.

259
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,407  X1:322 X2:380 Y1:418 Y2:449
Bye!

260
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:41,413  X1:214 X2:486 Y1:382 Y2:449
Yeah, of course,
you know I love you.

261
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:44,075  X1:160 X2:541 Y1:382 Y2:449
All right. We'll hook up later.
Anything you want, sweetie.

262
00:25:51,691 --> 00:25:53,625  X1:268 X2:434 Y1:418 Y2:449
Here you go.

263
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:59,261  X1:201 X2:499 Y1:382 Y2:449
- This is the girl?
- No, it's your mammy.

264
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:09,941  X1:152 X2:551 Y1:418 Y2:449
Maria's having a party tonight.

265
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,806  X1:284 X2:417 Y1:418 Y2:449
Bye, guys.

266
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:15,439  X1:115 X2:587 Y1:382 Y2:449
Are you gonna go?
I'll meet you there. See you tonight.

267
00:26:15,515 --> 00:26:17,449  X1:324 X2:377 Y1:418 Y2:449
Bye.

268
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,610  X1:201 X2:502 Y1:418 Y2:449
Lance! You're so nasty.

269
00:26:21,688 --> 00:26:26,625  X1:067 X2:634 Y1:382 Y2:449
A much deserved and hard-won reputation.
Am I still riding with you?

270
00:26:26,693 --> 00:26:30,925  X1:167 X2:533 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Don't push my hand away.
- Stop!

271
00:26:30,997 --> 00:26:35,195  X1:176 X2:524 Y1:382 Y2:449
What's your problem?
You're an ice queen today.

272
00:26:36,202 --> 00:26:38,636  X1:155 X2:545 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Stop!
- Good afternoon, Miss Nishi.

273
00:26:38,705 --> 00:26:41,469  X1:239 X2:465 Y1:382 Y2:445
Hi. Who are you?
Where's Aaron?

274
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:45,477  X1:111 X2:592 Y1:382 Y2:449
He couldn't make it today. He's sick.
Is this yours?

275
00:26:45,545 --> 00:26:46,910  X1:316 X2:384 Y1:418 Y2:445
Yeah.

276
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,316  X1:304 X2:398 Y1:418 Y2:449
See ya.

277
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,430  X1:106 X2:595 Y1:382 Y2:449
Sir, I think it would better if you
could get a ride from somebody else.

278
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,628  X1:177 X2:526 Y1:418 Y2:449
Bro, don't worry about me.

279
00:27:10,703 --> 00:27:13,399  X1:154 X2:546 Y1:382 Y2:449
Drive the car.
That's what you're paid to do.

280
00:27:13,473 --> 00:27:15,634  X1:157 X2:543 Y1:418 Y2:449
And don't forget my suitcase.

281
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:22,508  X1:147 X2:553 Y1:382 Y2:449
Careful with that case, bro!
There's fragile crystal in there.

282
00:27:22,582 --> 00:27:25,779  X1:168 X2:532 Y1:382 Y2:449
You break it,
you'll be back driving cabs.

283
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,013  X1:215 X2:486 Y1:418 Y2:449
Sorry about that, sir.

284
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:43,461  X1:282 X2:419 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Bro?
- Yes, sir?

285
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,562  X1:171 X2:530 Y1:382 Y2:449
- A little privacy!
- Yes, sir. Sorry about that.

286
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:48,072  X1:281 X2:421 Y1:418 Y2:445
Domestics!

287
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,471  X1:309 X2:393 Y1:418 Y2:445
Lance!

288
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,675  X1:190 X2:513 Y1:418 Y2:449
Lance, no. No. Come on.

289
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,241  X1:258 X2:445 Y1:382 Y2:449
Yeah, right!
No means yes.

290
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,811  X1:087 X2:614 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Come on, baby, you know you want it.
- Stop!

291
00:28:03,923 --> 00:28:05,322  X1:278 X2:424 Y1:418 Y2:445
Get off me!

292
00:28:06,326 --> 00:28:09,454  X1:111 X2:591 Y1:418 Y2:449
Fucky-sucky. Me love you long time!

293
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:11,463  X1:278 X2:424 Y1:418 Y2:445
Get off me!

294
00:28:11,531 --> 00:28:13,123  X1:303 X2:399 Y1:418 Y2:449
Stop it!

295
00:28:21,207 --> 00:28:23,505  X1:185 X2:517 Y1:418 Y2:449
What's up with that, bro?

296
00:28:24,544 --> 00:28:27,308  X1:183 X2:518 Y1:418 Y2:449
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

297
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:37,680  X1:079 X2:623 Y1:382 Y2:449
He's gonna take his hand off your mouth.
Don't scream or he's gonna shoot you.

298
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:40,123  X1:254 X2:447 Y1:418 Y2:449
I'll blow your...

299
00:28:40,193 --> 00:28:41,854  X1:245 X2:459 Y1:418 Y2:449
motherfucking--

300
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,328  X1:180 X2:521 Y1:418 Y2:449
I think she gets the point.

301
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:47,857  X1:288 X2:415 Y1:418 Y2:445
Professor.

302
00:28:49,802 --> 00:28:53,761  X1:108 X2:594 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'm really sorry about your boyfriend.
He was being kinda rude.

303
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,774  X1:263 X2:441 Y1:418 Y2:449
Do you mind?

304
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,043  X1:169 X2:532 Y1:418 Y2:449
This is a kidnapping, right?

305
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,478  X1:151 X2:551 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Right.
- So what's up with you guys?

306
00:29:01,547 --> 00:29:03,981  X1:110 X2:591 Y1:418 Y2:449
You supposed to be the Spice Boys?

307
00:29:11,457 --> 00:29:14,915  X1:182 X2:518 Y1:382 Y2:449
You need to chill
with that being witty shit.

308
00:29:14,994 --> 00:29:17,155  X1:147 X2:556 Y1:418 Y2:449
professor, put the cuffs on her.

309
00:29:19,565 --> 00:29:21,829  X1:160 X2:542 Y1:382 Y2:445
Skipper, professor, take care
of that mess in the backseat.

310
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:23,869  X1:167 X2:534 Y1:418 Y2:445
You must be the millionaire.

311
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:25,801  X1:274 X2:429 Y1:418 Y2:449
pretty soon.

312
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:34,840  X1:271 X2:431 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Read this.
- "Father--"

313
00:29:38,618 --> 00:29:40,848  X1:166 X2:535 Y1:382 Y2:445
"Father, I have been abduct.
I am fine."

314
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,512  X1:286 X2:415 Y1:418 Y2:445
Abducted.

315
00:29:43,189 --> 00:29:45,851  X1:215 X2:486 Y1:382 Y2:449
- It says "abduct."
- Just say abducted.

316
00:29:47,727 --> 00:29:53,029  X1:102 X2:600 Y1:382 Y2:449
"I have been abducted. I am fine now,
but I may not be for loring.

317
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:56,398  X1:185 X2:517 Y1:382 Y2:445
If you do not pay the sun
of one million doolers--"

318
00:29:56,469 --> 00:30:01,236  X1:083 X2:618 Y1:382 Y2:449
-"Loring"? "Sun of one million doolers"?
-That's what it says.

319
00:30:01,307 --> 00:30:04,936  X1:169 X2:533 Y1:382 Y2:445
That's "Iong" and the "sum"
of one million "dollars."

320
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,002  X1:175 X2:526 Y1:382 Y2:445
- You know what it means.
- You told me to read this.

321
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,378  X1:193 X2:506 Y1:382 Y2:449
- That's what I'm doing.
- Say what it means.

322
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,582  X1:128 X2:573 Y1:382 Y2:449
Be careful with that one.
That's Lance's crystal. It's fragile.

323
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,897  X1:111 X2:591 Y1:382 Y2:449
"I may not be for long. If you do not
pay the sum of one million dollars...

324
00:30:26,966 --> 00:30:30,527  X1:131 X2:569 Y1:382 Y2:445
you will never see me alive again
as these men mean businesses."

325
00:30:30,603 --> 00:30:32,298  X1:245 X2:457 Y1:418 Y2:445
Who wrote this?

326
00:30:33,506 --> 00:30:35,440  X1:287 X2:414 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Crunch!
- What?

327
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,442  X1:126 X2:577 Y1:418 Y2:449
I think he's pissed about the note.

328
00:30:39,512 --> 00:30:41,241  X1:217 X2:487 Y1:418 Y2:449
It says "businesses."

329
00:30:41,314 --> 00:30:44,750  X1:157 X2:543 Y1:382 Y2:449
You told me to read the note.
You never said to improv it.

330
00:30:44,817 --> 00:30:49,584  X1:097 X2:606 Y1:382 Y2:449
Improv! Are you Meryl-fucking-Streep?
Okay, improv the note.

331
00:30:49,655 --> 00:30:54,615  X1:129 X2:572 Y1:382 Y2:449
These sexually frustrated
degenerate losers mean business.

332
00:30:54,694 --> 00:30:57,788  X1:206 X2:497 Y1:382 Y2:449
Don't, don't improv.
Don't improv the note.

333
00:30:57,864 --> 00:31:00,799  X1:155 X2:547 Y1:418 Y2:449
Gump, give me a fucking pen!

334
00:31:12,178 --> 00:31:13,406  X1:316 X2:386 Y1:418 Y2:445
Read.

335
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:16,812  X1:152 X2:552 Y1:382 Y2:445
"Dad, been kidnapped.
Send one million or I'm dead."

336
00:31:16,883 --> 00:31:18,407  X1:302 X2:400 Y1:418 Y2:445
perfect.

337
00:31:23,623 --> 00:31:26,820  X1:211 X2:490 Y1:382 Y2:449
Yo, Mel, my player,
here go the scenario.

338
00:31:26,893 --> 00:31:30,556  X1:112 X2:590 Y1:382 Y2:449
Since Chantel is cool, take homegirl
and store her at your place.

339
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,757  X1:241 X2:461 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Why my place?
- 'Cause.

340
00:31:32,832 --> 00:31:35,096  X1:257 X2:444 Y1:382 Y2:445
- 'Cause why?
- 'Cause!

341
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:38,137  X1:104 X2:597 Y1:382 Y2:449
'Cause that's the best plan right now.
Just do what I say.

342
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:53,485  X1:131 X2:570 Y1:382 Y2:449
- What about the limo?
- You want me to drive that, too?

343
00:31:53,553 --> 00:31:56,078  X1:202 X2:501 Y1:382 Y2:445
I got the limo, the girl,
all kind of shit.

344
00:31:56,155 --> 00:31:58,089  X1:198 X2:504 Y1:418 Y2:449
What's your name, kid?

345
00:31:58,157 --> 00:32:01,991  X1:152 X2:550 Y1:382 Y2:449
Shut up. Don't fuck this up.
I got to get home and jerk off.

346
00:32:02,061 --> 00:32:05,724  X1:135 X2:565 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Can you--
- Drive! Yes, I can fucking drive.

347
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,900  X1:265 X2:435 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Hi, honey!
- Hiya, Mom!

348
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,037  X1:271 X2:432 Y1:418 Y2:449
Look at you!

349
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:23,604  X1:200 X2:504 Y1:418 Y2:449
Hiya, Dad. How are ya?

350
00:32:23,683 --> 00:32:25,651  X1:188 X2:515 Y1:418 Y2:449
How was your train ride?

351
00:32:25,718 --> 00:32:29,313  X1:101 X2:600 Y1:382 Y2:445
The train ride was fine. It's the
cab ride over I could've lived without.

352
00:32:29,388 --> 00:32:32,551  X1:117 X2:585 Y1:382 Y2:449
This Turkish idiot who barely spoke
one word of English...

353
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:35,093  X1:161 X2:541 Y1:382 Y2:445
drops us off at that schmuck
next door's house.

354
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:38,028  X1:087 X2:613 Y1:382 Y2:449
And the bastard, could you believe this,
he starts cursing at us!

355
00:32:38,097 --> 00:32:40,327  X1:242 X2:459 Y1:382 Y2:445
- I need a drink.
- No!

356
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,168  X1:301 X2:401 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Ma?
- Yeah?

357
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:50,642  X1:170 X2:532 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'm not criticizing you
or anything like that, okay?

358
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,974  X1:212 X2:490 Y1:418 Y2:449
It's just that I think...

359
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:56,276  X1:127 X2:575 Y1:418 Y2:449
maybe you should dress your age.

360
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:02,010  X1:130 X2:573 Y1:382 Y2:445
I mean, look at Dad. He's dressed
like a villain from "Miami Vice."

361
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:06,252  X1:117 X2:586 Y1:382 Y2:449
Dress my age? I'll have you know
Morton and I dress the way we feel.

362
00:33:06,325 --> 00:33:08,259  X1:223 X2:479 Y1:418 Y2:449
Look at your father.

363
00:33:08,327 --> 00:33:10,818  X1:170 X2:532 Y1:418 Y2:449
He's a regular sex machine.

364
00:33:11,731 --> 00:33:13,722  X1:184 X2:516 Y1:418 Y2:449
Yeah, a regular Brad Pitt.

365
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:17,462  X1:161 X2:541 Y1:418 Y2:449
So, where is our benefactor?

366
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,664  X1:258 X2:444 Y1:418 Y2:449
Are you okay?

367
00:33:23,743 --> 00:33:25,904  X1:174 X2:527 Y1:418 Y2:449
All right. I'll be right back.

368
00:33:29,515 --> 00:33:33,645  X1:144 X2:558 Y1:382 Y2:449
I went to the bank today,
and do you know what I found?

369
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:36,552  X1:158 X2:545 Y1:382 Y2:445
Or should I say, do you know
what I didn't find?

370
00:33:36,622 --> 00:33:40,558  X1:114 X2:586 Y1:382 Y2:449
- I wasn't able to--
- I am really starting to dislike you.

371
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:46,558  X1:186 X2:514 Y1:382 Y2:445
- I didn't find my money!
- It's at Crunch's.

372
00:33:46,632 --> 00:33:49,567  X1:182 X2:520 Y1:418 Y2:449
I'll call and get it tonight.

373
00:33:49,635 --> 00:33:51,227  X1:320 X2:382 Y1:418 Y2:445
Now!

374
00:33:57,276 --> 00:34:00,677  X1:165 X2:536 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Yo, money! You ready to--
- Do it. Yeah.

375
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:02,714  X1:247 X2:453 Y1:418 Y2:449
That's my word!

376
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:05,874  X1:168 X2:534 Y1:418 Y2:449
Make sure we get this right.

377
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,443  X1:181 X2:519 Y1:382 Y2:445
Crunch fucked me up
with that whack-ass note.

378
00:34:08,521 --> 00:34:11,388  X1:147 X2:556 Y1:382 Y2:449
All right.
My phone is plugged into here.

379
00:34:11,457 --> 00:34:15,086  X1:123 X2:580 Y1:382 Y2:449
This motherfucking Tracebuster
will keep that motherfucker from--

380
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:17,891  X1:111 X2:591 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Trace?
- Tracing our shit. Know what I say?

381
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:22,367  X1:141 X2:561 Y1:382 Y2:449
This Tracebuster keeps a buster
from tracing your call.

382
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,802  X1:255 X2:448 Y1:382 Y2:445
- It can also--
- Trace?

383
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:28,271  X1:195 X2:505 Y1:382 Y2:449
Trace the motherfucker
that's tracing your shit!

384
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:31,139  X1:114 X2:587 Y1:418 Y2:449
What if they got a Tracebuster, too?

385
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,771  X1:195 X2:505 Y1:382 Y2:445
That's why I've got
this Tracebuster Buster.

386
00:34:34,847 --> 00:34:37,543  X1:138 X2:564 Y1:382 Y2:449
When a motherfucker try to bust
your trace with a Tracebuster...

387
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:42,213  X1:132 X2:569 Y1:382 Y2:449
this will bust the motherfucking
Tracebuster that's busting your--

388
00:34:43,522 --> 00:34:46,514  X1:186 X2:515 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Trace!
- That's my word, player!

389
00:34:46,592 --> 00:34:51,461  X1:138 X2:563 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Use my cell phone.
- patch that into here, all right?

390
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,863  X1:148 X2:552 Y1:382 Y2:445
- plug and play, motherfucker!
- Yo!

391
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:30,734  X1:315 X2:388 Y1:418 Y2:445
Hello.

392
00:35:30,803 --> 00:35:35,172  X1:092 X2:611 Y1:382 Y2:449
Mr. Nishi, you don't know me, but
I have something you may want to hear.

393
00:35:36,275 --> 00:35:38,800  X1:215 X2:489 Y1:382 Y2:445
If says "businesses. "
That's whaf if--

394
00:35:38,878 --> 00:35:41,005  X1:207 X2:494 Y1:418 Y2:445
Hold on. That's not it.

395
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:46,543  X1:174 X2:529 Y1:418 Y2:449
These sexually frustrated--

396
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:50,077  X1:147 X2:554 Y1:418 Y2:449
Hold on. Just, you know, relax.

397
00:35:53,092 --> 00:35:56,858  X1:116 X2:587 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Listen to this.
- Tooth polish, hemorrhoid cream--

398
00:35:59,765 --> 00:36:02,256  X1:264 X2:439 Y1:418 Y2:445
Hello? Hello?

399
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:07,405  X1:136 X2:566 Y1:382 Y2:449
That motherfucker had the nerve
to hop smart on my ass!

400
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,423  X1:310 X2:391 Y1:418 Y2:445
What?

401
00:36:27,893 --> 00:36:32,330  X1:156 X2:545 Y1:382 Y2:445
Dad, I've been kidnap,ed.
Send one million or I'm dead.

402
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,831  X1:269 X2:433 Y1:418 Y2:445
Who is this?

403
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:36,333  X1:154 X2:548 Y1:382 Y2:449
Don't worry about who this is!
We have your daughter.

404
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,336  X1:145 X2:556 Y1:416 Y2:447
We want $1 million or she dies.

405
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:41,066  X1:224 X2:476 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Plain and simple.
- Is she okay?

406
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,132  X1:155 X2:547 Y1:382 Y2:449
She's fine, but if we don't get
that money she won't be.

407
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,647  X1:224 X2:478 Y1:382 Y2:449
I don't have money.
I go bankrupt.

408
00:36:48,714 --> 00:36:53,981  X1:100 X2:602 Y1:382 Y2:449
Bullshit! Don't fuck with us or we'll
send her back in little fucking pieces!

409
00:36:55,187 --> 00:36:58,020  X1:110 X2:595 Y1:382 Y2:445
Get us the million by noon tomorrow
or she's a slab of meat!

410
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,651  X1:233 X2:469 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Undersfand me?
- I understand.

411
00:37:01,727 --> 00:37:04,855  X1:107 X2:595 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'll call you at 10:00 a.m. and tell you
where the drop goes down. No cops.

412
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,923  X1:123 X2:580 Y1:382 Y2:449
Or I starf cutfing.

413
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:11,970  X1:177 X2:526 Y1:382 Y2:449
Don't try to trace this call.
It won't do you no good.

414
00:37:13,205 --> 00:37:15,537  X1:197 X2:504 Y1:418 Y2:449
That's how you do shit!

415
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:19,374  X1:150 X2:551 Y1:382 Y2:449
I gots this shit well in control!
We're about to get paid.

416
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:23,506  X1:225 X2:479 Y1:382 Y2:449
I not call police.
Fuck all the police!

417
00:37:23,582 --> 00:37:25,516  X1:175 X2:527 Y1:418 Y2:445
Was I a bad motherfucker?

418
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:28,178  X1:230 X2:473 Y1:382 Y2:445
- You was a bad--
- Motherfucker!

419
00:37:28,254 --> 00:37:30,154  X1:218 X2:483 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Bad!
- Bad motherfucker!

420
00:37:30,222 --> 00:37:32,782  X1:267 X2:435 Y1:418 Y2:449
Mean! Nasty!

421
00:37:34,026 --> 00:37:36,153  X1:227 X2:476 Y1:418 Y2:449
I trace you, buster!

422
00:37:41,734 --> 00:37:44,726  X1:227 X2:474 Y1:418 Y2:449
Up you go. Go, go.

423
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,901  X1:315 X2:388 Y1:418 Y2:445
Hello.

424
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:11,954  X1:253 X2:447 Y1:418 Y2:449
That's it, baby.

425
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:15,831  X1:090 X2:610 Y1:382 Y2:449
10:00 a.m. tomorrow we set up the drop
and by noon we get paid.

426
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:17,334  X1:257 X2:444 Y1:418 Y2:449
Yo, my nigger!

427
00:38:17,403 --> 00:38:20,463  X1:222 X2:477 Y1:418 Y2:449
We gonna get paid!

428
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:23,570  X1:265 X2:437 Y1:418 Y2:445
In the house!

429
00:38:23,642 --> 00:38:26,702  X1:185 X2:518 Y1:382 Y2:445
Get your ass to my office
in 20 minutes.

430
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:31,711  X1:221 X2:482 Y1:418 Y2:445
Fuck! Motherfucker!

431
00:38:31,784 --> 00:38:35,083  X1:082 X2:621 Y1:382 Y2:449
Paris called me for some emergency shit.
Don't do jack till I get back.

432
00:38:35,154 --> 00:38:37,554  X1:182 X2:518 Y1:382 Y2:449
Yo, yo, if you want me to,
I could set up the--

433
00:38:37,623 --> 00:38:40,558  X1:169 X2:534 Y1:382 Y2:449
Drop it, motherfucker!
Don't do shit till I get back!

434
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:51,864  X1:123 X2:579 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'm really sorry.
I mean, it's nice to finally meet ya.

435
00:38:51,937 --> 00:38:55,532  X1:161 X2:538 Y1:382 Y2:445
You seem like a nice enough
German-lrish fella.

436
00:38:55,608 --> 00:38:59,271  X1:097 X2:605 Y1:382 Y2:449
And I hope you won't take any offense
when I say...

437
00:38:59,345 --> 00:39:01,643  X1:098 X2:603 Y1:418 Y2:449
what are you both, out of your minds?

438
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,274  X1:133 X2:566 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Ma, we know what we're doing.
- Oh, yeah?

439
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,547  X1:159 X2:541 Y1:382 Y2:449
You're gonna kill your father.
That's what you're doing.

440
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,885  X1:124 X2:577 Y1:382 Y2:445
Marriage? You two?
A Catholic and a Jew? God forbid.

441
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:15,322  X1:162 X2:540 Y1:382 Y2:449
You're gonna put your father
in an early grave!

442
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:19,330  X1:104 X2:597 Y1:382 Y2:449
- What is this doing to your parents?
- Actually they're both dead.

443
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,332  X1:206 X2:495 Y1:418 Y2:449
You see? Do you see?

444
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,335  X1:124 X2:579 Y1:418 Y2:449
Ma, they were dead before we met.

445
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:29,898  X1:142 X2:560 Y1:382 Y2:449
I know. This isn't about Daddy
or Mel's parents. It's about you.

446
00:39:29,975 --> 00:39:32,273  X1:232 X2:468 Y1:418 Y2:449
You're prejudiced.

447
00:39:32,344 --> 00:39:34,869  X1:156 X2:546 Y1:382 Y2:445
- prejudiced? I'm prejudiced?
- Yeah.

448
00:39:34,947 --> 00:39:38,314  X1:123 X2:581 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'll have you know there is not one
prejudiced bone in my body.

449
00:39:38,384 --> 00:39:42,514  X1:089 X2:613 Y1:382 Y2:449
Not prejudiced? lf I wanna marry goyim,
I'll marry goyim!

450
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,921  X1:127 X2:573 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Over my dead body you will!
- If I want, I'll marry a black man.

451
00:39:45,991 --> 00:39:48,516  X1:224 X2:478 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Shut your mouth!
- A six-foot-nine--

452
00:39:52,531 --> 00:39:55,056  X1:177 X2:526 Y1:382 Y2:449
Excuse me, sir.
I just wanted to apologize.

453
00:39:55,134 --> 00:39:57,329  X1:205 X2:499 Y1:382 Y2:445
I didn't mean to cause
such a schlimazel.

454
00:39:57,403 --> 00:39:59,894  X1:131 X2:572 Y1:418 Y2:449
I'll take them to temple tomorrow.

455
00:39:59,972 --> 00:40:02,907  X1:154 X2:550 Y1:418 Y2:449
Do you think that might work?

456
00:40:04,343 --> 00:40:06,538  X1:250 X2:451 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Mr. Shulman?
- Mort.

457
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:10,571  X1:124 X2:577 Y1:382 Y2:449
Sorry. Mort. Sir, I know how
your wife feels about me and pam.

458
00:40:10,649 --> 00:40:14,346  X1:098 X2:605 Y1:382 Y2:449
I just wanted you to know that I would
never marry her without your blessing.

459
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:18,354  X1:295 X2:407 Y1:418 Y2:449
Yes, sir?

460
00:40:18,424 --> 00:40:21,120  X1:111 X2:591 Y1:382 Y2:445
Could you get me a shot of that rum
I saw in there?

461
00:40:21,193 --> 00:40:22,820  X1:278 X2:421 Y1:418 Y2:449
Yeah, sure.

462
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:52,413  X1:090 X2:609 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Never give Daddy something to drink.
- Why? What's the matter?

463
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,051  X1:238 X2:462 Y1:382 Y2:445
- It's horrible.
- It's not so bad.

464
00:40:55,127 --> 00:40:59,086  X1:095 X2:607 Y1:382 Y2:449
It's not so bad?
He's a meshuggenah, that's what he is.

465
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:30,188  X1:162 X2:540 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Yo, boss, what's going on?
- Sit down and shut up.

466
00:41:39,004 --> 00:41:41,438  X1:198 X2:507 Y1:382 Y2:445
Even for those who live
outside the law...

467
00:41:43,142 --> 00:41:48,136  X1:083 X2:621 Y1:382 Y2:445
it is commonly understood that there are
certain rules which must be observed.

468
00:41:48,213 --> 00:41:51,273  X1:111 X2:590 Y1:418 Y2:449
Otherwise what you have is anarchy.

469
00:41:52,217 --> 00:41:54,242  X1:242 X2:460 Y1:418 Y2:449
I hear you, boss.

470
00:41:56,155 --> 00:42:00,421  X1:139 X2:561 Y1:382 Y2:449
We run a serious business here.
The business of making money.

471
00:42:00,492 --> 00:42:04,758  X1:144 X2:557 Y1:382 Y2:449
This business is based on trust
and loyalty and honor.

472
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:08,231  X1:211 X2:492 Y1:382 Y2:449
In the house of Paris,
that's all we've got.

473
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,666  X1:233 X2:470 Y1:382 Y2:445
That's it, baby.
It's all about love.

474
00:42:17,042 --> 00:42:21,570  X1:088 X2:613 Y1:382 Y2:449
When the rules are broken in the house
of Paris, the machine breaks down.

475
00:42:22,848 --> 00:42:25,248  X1:164 X2:537 Y1:418 Y2:449
Discipline must be enforced.

476
00:42:25,317 --> 00:42:28,718  X1:194 X2:506 Y1:418 Y2:445
Order must be restored.

477
00:42:28,787 --> 00:42:31,984  X1:142 X2:558 Y1:382 Y2:449
In my house,
there has been a transgression.

478
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:37,452  X1:078 X2:623 Y1:418 Y2:449
An unauthorized kidnapping in my house.

479
00:42:38,997 --> 00:42:41,864  X1:164 X2:537 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Who could be that stupid?
- It gets worse.

480
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,801  X1:194 X2:507 Y1:418 Y2:449
In this particular case...

481
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,838  X1:155 X2:546 Y1:418 Y2:449
the transgression is personal.

482
00:42:46,905 --> 00:42:49,032  X1:263 X2:440 Y1:418 Y2:445
In this case...

483
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:53,306  X1:159 X2:542 Y1:382 Y2:449
the kidnappee happens to be
my goddaughter.

484
00:42:53,378 --> 00:42:55,938  X1:265 X2:435 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Fuck no!
- Some rock.

485
00:42:56,014 --> 00:42:57,675  X1:281 X2:419 Y1:418 Y2:445
Some dolt.

486
00:42:57,749 --> 00:43:01,549  X1:145 X2:558 Y1:382 Y2:445
Some less than senseless thing
has decided to come...

487
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,555  X1:080 X2:621 Y1:418 Y2:449
to my house and kidnap my goddaughter.

488
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,614  X1:226 X2:474 Y1:418 Y2:449
And I am looking...

489
00:43:06,692 --> 00:43:09,820  X1:117 X2:586 Y1:418 Y2:449
I am searching for a motherfucker...

490
00:43:09,895 --> 00:43:12,830  X1:146 X2:555 Y1:418 Y2:449
stupid enough to fuck with me.

491
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,027  X1:189 X2:512 Y1:382 Y2:445
Yo, boss, what's this got
to do with me?

492
00:43:18,103 --> 00:43:21,698  X1:127 X2:576 Y1:382 Y2:449
I want to know what you would do
to that son of a jackal.

493
00:43:23,008 --> 00:43:24,441  X1:326 X2:377 Y1:418 Y2:445
Me?

494
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:28,946  X1:162 X2:541 Y1:418 Y2:449
I would, you know, I would--

495
00:43:29,014 --> 00:43:32,780  X1:131 X2:568 Y1:418 Y2:449
What would you do to someone...

496
00:43:32,851 --> 00:43:37,481  X1:156 X2:544 Y1:382 Y2:449
who decided to fuck with you
in your own house?

497
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,883  X1:224 X2:478 Y1:418 Y2:449
I'd bust some caps!

498
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:44,759  X1:182 X2:519 Y1:382 Y2:449
Bust some caps!
Give this man a gold star.

499
00:43:46,231 --> 00:43:49,359  X1:253 X2:451 Y1:418 Y2:449
It is you who--

500
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,035  X1:264 X2:438 Y1:418 Y2:445
Give me that!

501
00:43:55,474 --> 00:44:00,912  X1:125 X2:579 Y1:382 Y2:449
It is you that I'm putting in charge
of this whole operation.

502
00:44:00,979 --> 00:44:04,608  X1:160 X2:542 Y1:418 Y2:449
It is you who must go forth...

503
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:09,347  X1:104 X2:596 Y1:418 Y2:449
and bring these motherfuckers to me.

504
00:44:19,565 --> 00:44:22,056  X1:175 X2:528 Y1:418 Y2:449
Let's just take the money...

505
00:44:22,134 --> 00:44:25,001  X1:166 X2:538 Y1:382 Y2:449
and go to L.A. where people
like us belong.

506
00:44:26,171 --> 00:44:27,604  X1:239 X2:463 Y1:418 Y2:445
I love this movie.

507
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:55,861  X1:199 X2:504 Y1:382 Y2:445
Get that, Mel, will you?
I'm not dressed.

508
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,828  X1:181 X2:520 Y1:418 Y2:449
What are you doing here?

509
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:02,101  X1:141 X2:564 Y1:382 Y2:449
I just came to drop your shit off
before I said good-bye.

510
00:45:02,174 --> 00:45:04,972  X1:147 X2:553 Y1:382 Y2:449
Good-bye, you punk-ass bitch.
I'm leaving this town.

511
00:45:05,043 --> 00:45:08,342  X1:152 X2:549 Y1:418 Y2:449
What are you doing? Chantel?

512
00:45:08,413 --> 00:45:10,005  X1:321 X2:381 Y1:418 Y2:445
Shit!

513
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:14,751  X1:129 X2:574 Y1:418 Y2:449
I'm getting a glass of prune juice.

514
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,152  X1:167 X2:533 Y1:382 Y2:449
Hurry up.
We've got a long way to go.

515
00:45:17,222 --> 00:45:19,690  X1:149 X2:552 Y1:418 Y2:449
Don't worry. I know a shortcut.

516
00:45:47,986 --> 00:45:50,284  X1:180 X2:521 Y1:382 Y2:445
No, sweetie.
You don't want to do that.

517
00:45:50,355 --> 00:45:52,983  X1:160 X2:541 Y1:382 Y2:449
- What's in there? It's heavy.
- It's deer meat, actually.

518
00:45:53,058 --> 00:45:56,323  X1:080 X2:620 Y1:382 Y2:449
- What?
- Cisco went hunting and bagged a deer.

519
00:45:56,395 --> 00:45:59,159  X1:176 X2:524 Y1:382 Y2:449
He gave the meat to me
because he's a vegetarian.

520
00:45:59,231 --> 00:46:01,165  X1:144 X2:557 Y1:382 Y2:445
- There's a dead deer in there?
- Yeah.

521
00:46:01,233 --> 00:46:03,997  X1:192 X2:510 Y1:382 Y2:449
That's gross. Take it out
to the garbage, please.

522
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:06,799  X1:241 X2:461 Y1:418 Y2:449
Sorry about that.

523
00:46:22,387 --> 00:46:24,321  X1:183 X2:519 Y1:418 Y2:449
Ma, pour me some coffee.

524
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:28,452  X1:141 X2:559 Y1:382 Y2:449
- You don't want to go in there.
- I need to get something.

525
00:46:28,527 --> 00:46:31,496  X1:112 X2:590 Y1:418 Y2:449
It smells really bad. Stinky poo-poo.

526
00:46:31,563 --> 00:46:33,758  X1:234 X2:466 Y1:418 Y2:449
That's disgusting.

527
00:46:36,068 --> 00:46:38,764  X1:188 X2:515 Y1:418 Y2:449
Morton, look at that dog.

528
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:45,909  X1:257 X2:445 Y1:418 Y2:449
Hey, get away!

529
00:46:45,977 --> 00:46:48,605  X1:199 X2:503 Y1:418 Y2:449
Go away, you giant rat!

530
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,581  X1:154 X2:549 Y1:382 Y2:449
There's something so peculiar
about that boy.

531
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,778  X1:306 X2:396 Y1:418 Y2:449
Let go!

532
00:47:03,328 --> 00:47:05,319  X1:235 X2:464 Y1:382 Y2:449

533
00:47:16,975 --> 00:47:18,567  X1:197 X2:505 Y1:418 Y2:449
Now I'm hearing things.

534
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,877  X1:171 X2:529 Y1:382 Y2:445
- I am not going to temple.

535
00:47:26,952 --> 00:47:28,249  X1:313 X2:388 Y1:418 Y2:445

536
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,914  X1:120 X2:581 Y1:418 Y2:449
Understandable you're avoiding us.

537
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:33,219  X1:155 X2:546 Y1:382 Y2:449
- You know why we're calling.

538
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:35,782  X1:150 X2:551 Y1:382 Y2:449

539
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:39,820  X1:083 X2:620 Y1:382 Y2:449
Why are you crying?
Because I wanna rent "King Kong Lives."

540
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,458  X1:180 X2:521 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Who are you talking to?
- I'm sorry.

541
00:47:42,534 --> 00:47:46,402  X1:108 X2:595 Y1:382 Y2:449
But you can't rent that.
Melvin Smiley has that out right now.

542
00:47:46,471 --> 00:47:50,430  X1:109 X2:592 Y1:382 Y2:449

543
00:47:54,045 --> 00:47:56,775  X1:168 X2:533 Y1:418 Y2:449
Aren't you going to temple?

544
00:47:56,848 --> 00:48:00,147  X1:121 X2:578 Y1:382 Y2:449
- What do you mean, no?
- You're going to ruin my surprise.

545
00:48:00,218 --> 00:48:03,187  X1:212 X2:490 Y1:382 Y2:449
I don't like surprises.
What surprise?

546
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,952  X1:116 X2:585 Y1:382 Y2:449
I was planning on cooking a nice
kosher meal for you and your folks.

547
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:12,328  X1:184 X2:516 Y1:382 Y2:445
- This I gotta see.
- Excuse me one second.

548
00:48:12,397 --> 00:48:14,388  X1:258 X2:445 Y1:418 Y2:449
Let go of that!

549
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,701  X1:306 X2:396 Y1:418 Y2:449
Let go!

550
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,065  X1:252 X2:448 Y1:418 Y2:445
Get outta here.

551
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:24,666  X1:159 X2:540 Y1:418 Y2:449
You are a pathetic little man.

552
00:48:32,918 --> 00:48:34,351  X1:321 X2:381 Y1:418 Y2:445
Shit!

553
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,938  X1:271 X2:430 Y1:418 Y2:445
You're back.

554
00:48:54,005 --> 00:48:57,702  X1:154 X2:548 Y1:382 Y2:449
Daddy had to make a pit stop,
and I forgot my purse.

555
00:48:57,776 --> 00:48:59,835  X1:124 X2:576 Y1:382 Y2:445
You don't have to make a pit stop,
Mrs. Shulman?

556
00:48:59,911 --> 00:49:02,106  X1:230 X2:473 Y1:382 Y2:449
No, I'm fine.
I'm fine right here.

557
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:05,013  X1:230 X2:471 Y1:382 Y2:445
- It's a long drive.
- I'm fine.

558
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:07,881  X1:274 X2:427 Y1:382 Y2:445
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

559
00:49:07,953 --> 00:49:12,014  X1:127 X2:576 Y1:418 Y2:449
I forgot a thing in the trunk there.

560
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:15,218  X1:115 X2:586 Y1:382 Y2:449
Look, if you've got a thing
in the trunk, you'd better get it out.

561
00:49:15,293 --> 00:49:16,726  X1:316 X2:386 Y1:418 Y2:443
I will.

562
00:49:18,263 --> 00:49:21,755  X1:127 X2:574 Y1:382 Y2:449
- What's that?
- It's his thing. Get in. We're late.

563
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,495  X1:150 X2:552 Y1:382 Y2:449
If there's a dead deer in there,
get it out of there.

564
00:49:24,569 --> 00:49:26,503  X1:281 X2:420 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Let's go!
- I swear.

565
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:34,074  X1:264 X2:438 Y1:418 Y2:445
I can do this.

566
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:38,415  X1:146 X2:556 Y1:418 Y2:449
Cisco, where the fuck are you?

567
00:49:49,327 --> 00:49:52,228  X1:185 X2:518 Y1:418 Y2:449
Don't call. Don't you call.

568
00:49:52,297 --> 00:49:55,232  X1:207 X2:495 Y1:382 Y2:449
Don't you fuckin' call,
you stupid fuck.

569
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,269  X1:163 X2:537 Y1:418 Y2:449
They got Tracebuster Buster.

570
00:49:58,336 --> 00:50:02,739  X1:147 X2:557 Y1:382 Y2:445
I got Tracebuster Buster Buster
for their ass.

571
00:50:06,278 --> 00:50:08,303  X1:209 X2:492 Y1:382 Y2:445
All right, think, think.
Crunch!

572
00:50:09,347 --> 00:50:13,113  X1:233 X2:470 Y1:382 Y2:449
Be cool, playboy.
I got you covered.

573
00:50:13,184 --> 00:50:15,118  X1:253 X2:448 Y1:418 Y2:449
I tell you what.

574
00:50:15,186 --> 00:50:18,781  X1:125 X2:580 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'll pick the chick up and keep her
here in my crib. You feel better?

575
00:50:18,857 --> 00:50:21,553  X1:153 X2:548 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Much. What time?
- I've gotta sto, by fhe office.

576
00:50:21,626 --> 00:50:25,722  X1:111 X2:590 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Give me an hour and a half. Cool?
- Yeah, cool. Thanks, bro.

577
00:50:32,203 --> 00:50:36,003  X1:121 X2:580 Y1:382 Y2:445
You ready again? You ready again?
Come on.

578
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,614  X1:258 X2:444 Y1:418 Y2:449
Are you okay?

579
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:48,683  X1:108 X2:594 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'm gonna take your gag off,
but you gotta promise not to scream.

580
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,619  X1:148 X2:555 Y1:382 Y2:449
I don't suppose you could take
these cuffs off, too?

581
00:50:57,696 --> 00:51:00,665  X1:229 X2:472 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Sorry.
- I didn't think so.

582
00:51:00,732 --> 00:51:02,962  X1:247 X2:453 Y1:382 Y2:445
- I have to pee.
- Yeah.

583
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,967  X1:274 X2:428 Y1:418 Y2:449
I need help.

584
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,473  X1:287 X2:414 Y1:418 Y2:449
Oh, sorry.

585
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:16,980  X1:114 X2:587 Y1:382 Y2:449
No, I need help with my underwear,
unless you wanna take my cuffs off.

586
00:51:17,048 --> 00:51:18,481  X1:314 X2:388 Y1:418 Y2:449
Sorry.

587
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,405  X1:292 X2:410 Y1:418 Y2:445
I'm done.

588
00:51:49,114 --> 00:51:52,413  X1:124 X2:576 Y1:382 Y2:449
- You don't seem like a kidnapper.
- I'm usually not.

589
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:55,612  X1:182 X2:520 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Aren't you gonna flush?
- Yeah.

590
00:51:55,687 --> 00:51:57,814  X1:085 X2:616 Y1:418 Y2:449
Technically you could call me a hit man.

591
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:01,650  X1:223 X2:480 Y1:382 Y2:449
Really? A hit man?
Does that pay well?

592
00:52:01,726 --> 00:52:04,388  X1:246 X2:456 Y1:382 Y2:449
Of course.
I make a killing.

593
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:08,326  X1:233 X2:466 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

594
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,425  X1:138 X2:564 Y1:418 Y2:449
I'm hungry. You must be starved.

595
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:14,097  X1:142 X2:560 Y1:382 Y2:445
- I'm so hungry, I could eat a--
- Horse?

596
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,140  X1:183 X2:520 Y1:418 Y2:445
I could never eat a horse.

597
00:52:16,207 --> 00:52:19,267  X1:107 X2:597 Y1:382 Y2:445
Let me know what you want. I can go
in the kitchen and cook it for us.

598
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,369  X1:145 X2:557 Y1:418 Y2:449
Will you put a hit on it for me?

599
00:52:21,446 --> 00:52:23,346  X1:316 X2:384 Y1:418 Y2:445
Yeah.

600
00:52:23,415 --> 00:52:25,542  X1:185 X2:519 Y1:418 Y2:449
How about a pterodactyl?

601
00:52:25,617 --> 00:52:28,177  X1:245 X2:458 Y1:382 Y2:449
You're in luck.
I just whacked...

602
00:52:28,253 --> 00:52:30,687  X1:122 X2:580 Y1:382 Y2:449

pterodactyl.

603
00:52:30,755 --> 00:52:32,814  X1:237 X2:465 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Cold or nuked?
- Nuke it.

604
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:37,891  X1:147 X2:552 Y1:382 Y2:449
That girl from the other house,
she your girlfriend?

605
00:52:37,962 --> 00:52:41,398  X1:183 X2:517 Y1:382 Y2:449
Yeah, I guess so, kind of,
but I'm engaged to Pam.

606
00:52:41,466 --> 00:52:44,958  X1:103 X2:599 Y1:382 Y2:449
Chantel is kind of your girlfriend, but
you're engaged to another girl, Pam?

607
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:48,301  X1:216 X2:486 Y1:382 Y2:445
Sounds complicated.
Tell me more.

608
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:53,367  X1:146 X2:557 Y1:382 Y2:449
Cisco, I can do this.

00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,926  X1:266 X2:437 Y1:418 Y2:445
I understand.

628
00:54:49,994 --> 00:54:52,360  X1:260 X2:443 Y1:418 Y2:449
McBryde Trail.

629
00:54:53,731 --> 00:54:56,825  X1:195 X2:506 Y1:418 Y2:449
I will drop money there.

630
00:54:56,901 --> 00:54:58,334  X1:314 X2:388 Y1:418 Y2:445
Good.

631
00:55:04,142 --> 00:55:06,269  X1:236 X2:466 Y1:418 Y2:445
Get him. Get him!

632
00:55:08,246 --> 00:55:10,874  X1:237 X2:466 Y1:382 Y2:445
Let's go, let's go!
Bust a move!

633
00:55:20,258 --> 00:55:23,625  X1:106 X2:595 Y1:382 Y2:449
It's your life.
You have to take some responsibility.

634
00:55:24,762 --> 00:55:27,890  X1:131 X2:572 Y1:382 Y2:449
It seems like no matter what I do,
it's never really good enough.

635
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,094  X1:125 X2:577 Y1:382 Y2:449
You know?
It's starting to make me miserable.

636
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:34,468  X1:131 X2:570 Y1:382 Y2:449
You can't blame Chantel and pam
for taking advantage of you.

637
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:36,473  X1:150 X2:551 Y1:418 Y2:449
You make it too easy for them.

638
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:40,637  X1:187 X2:515 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'm not blaming them,
at least I'm not trying to.

639
00:55:42,814 --> 00:55:45,874  X1:129 X2:573 Y1:382 Y2:449
At the end of the day,
all I want them to do is be happy.

640
00:55:46,618 --> 00:55:48,552  X1:267 X2:434 Y1:418 Y2:445
I don't know.

641
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,919  X1:146 X2:554 Y1:382 Y2:449
I just can't stand the idea
of them not liking me anymore.

642
00:55:54,058 --> 00:55:57,619  X1:113 X2:589 Y1:382 Y2:449
To be perfectly honest, I can't stand
the idea of anybody not liking me.

643
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:01,123  X1:131 X2:569 Y1:418 Y2:449
That sounds pretty dysfunctional.

644
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:04,635  X1:208 X2:492 Y1:382 Y2:449
Why do you say that?
What do you mean?

645
00:56:04,702 --> 00:56:09,162  X1:132 X2:569 Y1:382 Y2:449
I mean, you might suffer from
a borderline personality disorder.

646
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,970  X1:070 X2:630 Y1:382 Y2:445
- And you have codependency issues, too.
- What?

647
00:56:13,144 --> 00:56:15,840  X1:247 X2:453 Y1:418 Y2:449
You're whipped.

648
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:19,145  X1:118 X2:581 Y1:382 Y2:449
You seem nice. You're not like
the others. Do what's right for you.

649
00:56:21,986 --> 00:56:24,454  X1:225 X2:476 Y1:382 Y2:445
You're really smart.
You know that?

650
00:56:40,505 --> 00:56:42,837  X1:204 X2:497 Y1:418 Y2:445
What the fuck is that?

651
00:56:54,419 --> 00:56:57,980  X1:154 X2:547 Y1:382 Y2:449
All right, you filthy
kidnapping scum person, you!

652
00:56:58,056 --> 00:57:00,286  X1:227 X2:475 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Where's the girl?
- She's at--

653
00:57:01,693 --> 00:57:03,661  X1:137 X2:566 Y1:418 Y2:449
Don't get cute with us, scumbag.

654
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:05,821  X1:144 X2:559 Y1:382 Y2:445
I've been sent here by my boss,
Paris...

655
00:57:05,897 --> 00:57:08,627  X1:121 X2:579 Y1:382 Y2:449
whose goddaughter you all happen
to be kidnapping...

656
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,224  X1:277 X2:423 Y1:418 Y2:445
to find her.

657
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:15,466  X1:166 X2:536 Y1:382 Y2:449
If you wanna stay breathing,
you better tell me, Melvin...

658
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,566  X1:085 X2:615 Y1:382 Y2:445
where the fuck she is and who the fuck,
Melvin...

659
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,838  X1:171 X2:532 Y1:382 Y2:449
is the insidious mastermind
behind this plot.

660
00:57:20,912 --> 00:57:22,345  X1:306 X2:396 Y1:418 Y2:445
Melvin.

661
00:57:23,848 --> 00:57:25,281  X1:303 X2:400 Y1:418 Y2:445
Melvin?

662
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:30,048  X1:201 X2:503 Y1:418 Y2:449
Melvin? Melvin Smiley?

663
00:57:31,356 --> 00:57:34,382  X1:141 X2:562 Y1:382 Y2:449
Melvin Smiley is the mastermind
behind this kidnapping?

664
00:57:36,227 --> 00:57:37,660  X1:269 X2:431 Y1:418 Y2:449
Oh, my God!

665
00:57:40,031 --> 00:57:42,022  X1:260 X2:440 Y1:418 Y2:445
What a world.

666
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,466  X1:212 X2:491 Y1:418 Y2:449
I mean, the humanity.

667
00:57:44,535 --> 00:57:45,968  X1:265 X2:434 Y1:418 Y2:449
The betrayal.

668
00:57:46,904 --> 00:57:49,839  X1:129 X2:573 Y1:418 Y2:449
He was like a brother to me, man.

669
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,637  X1:293 X2:408 Y1:418 Y2:449
Oh, well.

670
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:11,628  X1:206 X2:494 Y1:418 Y2:449
Somebody's gotta die.

671
00:58:13,164 --> 00:58:15,462  X1:116 X2:588 Y1:418 Y2:449
Look at it as a privilege, you know?

672
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:19,469  X1:110 X2:591 Y1:382 Y2:449
You're always dying to do something
for me. Now's your chance.

673
00:58:38,156 --> 00:58:40,522  X1:142 X2:559 Y1:418 Y2:449
All right, no more Mr. Nice Guy.

674
00:58:40,591 --> 00:58:42,991  X1:103 X2:600 Y1:418 Y2:449
Now we're gonna find Melvin Smiley...

675
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,222  X1:185 X2:516 Y1:418 Y2:449
and we're gonna kill him.

676
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:48,394  X1:203 X2:500 Y1:418 Y2:445
Melvin. Son of a bitch.

677
00:58:48,466 --> 00:58:51,697  X1:097 X2:606 Y1:382 Y2:449
I knew the boy had financial problems,
but I didn't dream he'd go this far.

678
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:54,704  X1:235 X2:468 Y1:382 Y2:445
Find the girl first,
then deal him.

679
00:58:56,507 --> 00:58:58,566  X1:192 X2:507 Y1:382 Y2:449
pack up.
We are going for a ride.

680
00:58:58,643 --> 00:59:03,171  X1:110 X2:593 Y1:382 Y2:449
Who knows what unspeakable things
they do to my little girl?

681
00:59:03,247 --> 00:59:03,314  X1:144 X2:560 Y1:382 Y2:445
It says you're supposed to soak
the matzo for five minutes.

682
00:59:03,314 --> 00:59:06,715  X1:144 X2:560 Y1:382 Y2:445
It says you're supposed to soak
the matzo for five minutes.

683
00:59:06,784 --> 00:59:09,252  X1:111 X2:590 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Okay.
- Is this traditional Jewish cooking?

684
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,686  X1:147 X2:553 Y1:382 Y2:445
I hope so. It's the only
Jewish cookbook in the house.

685
00:59:14,192 --> 00:59:16,786  X1:189 X2:512 Y1:382 Y2:445
You need margarine
to saute the mushrooms.

686
00:59:18,529 --> 00:59:20,292  X1:217 X2:485 Y1:418 Y2:445
Shit! ls that kosher?

687
00:59:20,364 --> 00:59:24,266  X1:105 X2:598 Y1:382 Y2:445
Like I would know. You need to stir it
so it doesn't stick.

688
00:59:25,536 --> 00:59:28,369  X1:152 X2:550 Y1:382 Y2:445
I could help you better
if I didn't have these cuffs on.

689
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:29,872  X1:293 X2:408 Y1:418 Y2:449
All right.

690
00:59:41,052 --> 00:59:43,077  X1:179 X2:521 Y1:418 Y2:449
You're pretty good at this.

691
00:59:44,055 --> 00:59:46,216  X1:165 X2:538 Y1:418 Y2:449
You ever cook for your dad?

692
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:48,554  X1:100 X2:602 Y1:418 Y2:449
My father doesn't even know I'm alive.

693
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,220  X1:176 X2:528 Y1:382 Y2:445
Not until I have to impress
some of his associates.

694
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:54,321  X1:163 X2:538 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Do you have brown sugar?
- Yeah.

695
00:59:58,536 --> 01:00:01,994  X1:134 X2:566 Y1:382 Y2:449
Do you know what it's like living
your life to please other people?

696
01:00:02,073 --> 01:00:04,234  X1:214 X2:489 Y1:418 Y2:449
I guess you do, huh?

697
01:00:05,376 --> 01:00:10,245  X1:079 X2:624 Y1:382 Y2:449
It's a drag. Sometimes I wish
I could just get away. Know what I mean?

698
01:00:10,314 --> 01:00:13,681  X1:123 X2:580 Y1:382 Y2:449
I do, as a matter of fact.
I've always dreamt of getting away.

699
01:00:17,788 --> 01:00:20,882  X1:137 X2:566 Y1:382 Y2:449
Come here. What are you doing?
You're missing the point.

700
01:00:20,958 --> 01:00:24,018  X1:081 X2:619 Y1:382 Y2:449
The whole joy of cooking. You have
to use your hands, get in and get messy.

701
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:26,763  X1:268 X2:432 Y1:418 Y2:445
Get in there.

702
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,225  X1:257 X2:445 Y1:418 Y2:445
Kind of like it.

703
01:00:37,642 --> 01:00:40,975  X1:193 X2:508 Y1:382 Y2:449
Now we have to glaze
our LM-4 white leghorn.

704
01:00:41,045 --> 01:00:44,139  X1:174 X2:526 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Our LM what?
- Common broiler chicken.

705
01:00:44,215 --> 01:00:46,911  X1:172 X2:530 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'm studying them
in advanced biotechnology.

706
01:01:41,973 --> 01:01:43,531  X1:312 X2:391 Y1:418 Y2:445
Damn !

707
01:01:43,608 --> 01:01:47,203  X1:160 X2:543 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'm sorry.
I'll clean it up for you, okay?

708
01:02:14,171 --> 01:02:17,629  X1:126 X2:575 Y1:382 Y2:445
Did you know the white leghorn
was bred with the Ross sire line...

709
01:02:17,708 --> 01:02:20,802  X1:138 X2:564 Y1:382 Y2:445
to create the hybrid
known as the Roslin QTL Cross?

710
01:02:20,878 --> 01:02:23,438  X1:225 X2:477 Y1:382 Y2:449
Of course.
Doesn't everybody?

711
01:02:23,514 --> 01:02:25,778  X1:184 X2:518 Y1:382 Y2:449
Gave rise to over
33 different phenotypes...

712
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:28,876  X1:124 X2:578 Y1:382 Y2:449
all distinct for reaching their
sexual maturity within two months.

713
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:30,750  X1:231 X2:470 Y1:418 Y2:445
Then we eat them.

714
01:02:30,821 --> 01:02:32,880  X1:323 X2:377 Y1:418 Y2:449
Yep.

715
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:37,394  X1:176 X2:524 Y1:382 Y2:445
You know, it's kind of sad.
In order to feed us...

716
01:02:37,461 --> 01:02:40,624  X1:191 X2:511 Y1:382 Y2:449
something so young and
in the prime of its life...

717
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,225  X1:281 X2:420 Y1:418 Y2:445
has to die.

718
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:49,906  X1:264 X2:437 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Help! Help!
- Keiko!

719
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,081  X1:292 X2:411 Y1:418 Y2:449
I'm sorry.

720
01:03:05,356 --> 01:03:06,789  X1:294 X2:407 Y1:418 Y2:449
Oh, shit!

721
01:03:13,197 --> 01:03:14,630  X1:317 X2:386 Y1:418 Y2:445
Fuck!

722
01:03:36,654 --> 01:03:40,146  X1:156 X2:546 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Here you go, Ma.
- You feel better, Bunza Bun?

723
01:03:40,224 --> 01:03:44,126  X1:114 X2:589 Y1:382 Y2:445
Getting your hair done always helps
to mend a broken heart.

724
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,720  X1:125 X2:576 Y1:418 Y2:449
You're doing the right thing, baby.

725
01:03:46,797 --> 01:03:49,493  X1:128 X2:573 Y1:418 Y2:449
We have to preserve our heritage.

726
01:03:49,567 --> 01:03:51,558  X1:175 X2:526 Y1:418 Y2:449
You'll tell him after eating.

727
01:03:51,635 --> 01:03:55,002  X1:107 X2:597 Y1:382 Y2:445
Better he should have a broken heart
on a full stomach.

728
01:03:55,072 --> 01:03:57,302  X1:089 X2:611 Y1:418 Y2:449
Think he's gonna take the money back?

729
01:04:11,856 --> 01:04:14,950  X1:132 X2:569 Y1:382 Y2:449
- What're you doing?
- Nothing. How was your outing?

730
01:04:15,025 --> 01:04:17,459  X1:122 X2:579 Y1:418 Y2:449
Smells good. Something's cooking.

731
01:04:17,528 --> 01:04:19,996  X1:133 X2:566 Y1:418 Y2:449
We're ready to eat when you are.

732
01:04:21,799 --> 01:04:24,324  X1:238 X2:462 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Hello?
- This is Crunch.

733
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,563  X1:216 X2:486 Y1:382 Y2:445
What's up?
Hold on one second.

734
01:04:26,637 --> 01:04:28,696  X1:123 X2:578 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Can you excuse me one second?
- Sure.

735
01:04:28,773 --> 01:04:30,707  X1:281 X2:418 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Let's go.
- Hello?

736
01:04:30,775 --> 01:04:32,868  X1:095 X2:606 Y1:418 Y2:449
Yo, Crunch. What the fuck is goin' on?

737
01:04:33,644 --> 01:04:35,077  X1:323 X2:379 Y1:418 Y2:445
Left.

738
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:38,544  X1:280 X2:423 Y1:418 Y2:449
Right here.

739
01:04:38,616 --> 01:04:40,709  X1:236 X2:463 Y1:418 Y2:449
This is the place.

740
01:04:40,785 --> 01:04:45,586  X1:100 X2:603 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'm gettin' the fuck out of the country,
and you need to do the same. Now!

741
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:49,090  X1:178 X2:521 Y1:418 Y2:449
I went by the office today.

742
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,253  X1:176 X2:526 Y1:418 Y2:449
paris is planning a big hit.

743
01:04:52,363 --> 01:04:55,924  X1:139 X2:563 Y1:382 Y2:445
Yo, nigger! I said it should have
some lanolin in it.

744
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,663  X1:103 X2:598 Y1:382 Y2:445
Not some goddamn aloe vera bullshit.
Motherfucker!

745
01:04:59,737 --> 01:05:01,762  X1:256 X2:446 Y1:418 Y2:449
Get it straight.

746
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:07,301  X1:071 X2:632 Y1:382 Y2:449
Seems like some motherfuckers done gone
and kidnapped paris' goddaughter.

747
01:05:07,378 --> 01:05:11,712  X1:071 X2:631 Y1:382 Y2:449
Some Japanese bitch. Our Japanese bitch.
See what I'm saying?

748
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:15,513  X1:126 X2:578 Y1:382 Y2:449
Look, you've got to let him have it
point blank.

749
01:05:15,586 --> 01:05:18,180  X1:186 X2:517 Y1:418 Y2:449
It's over. Kaput. That's it!

750
01:05:18,255 --> 01:05:21,247  X1:145 X2:558 Y1:418 Y2:449
But, Ma, that seems very harsh.

751
01:05:26,564 --> 01:05:28,657  X1:153 X2:549 Y1:418 Y2:449
Cisco's trying to save himself.

752
01:05:28,732 --> 01:05:30,825  X1:224 X2:477 Y1:418 Y2:445
He's after all of us.

753
01:05:30,901 --> 01:05:33,301  X1:263 X2:440 Y1:418 Y2:449
He got Gump.

754
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:34,803  X1:283 X2:419 Y1:418 Y2:449
My advice.

755
01:05:34,872 --> 01:05:38,035  X1:146 X2:555 Y1:382 Y2:449
Gef the fuck ouf of Dodge now,
nigger.

756
01:05:38,108 --> 01:05:41,009  X1:173 X2:530 Y1:382 Y2:449
There's a hif squad coming
for your ass righf now.

757
01:05:41,078 --> 01:05:42,636  X1:277 X2:426 Y1:418 Y2:445
Peace. Out.

758
01:05:42,713 --> 01:05:44,180  X1:321 X2:380 Y1:418 Y2:445
Shit.

759
01:06:00,364 --> 01:06:02,298  X1:139 X2:563 Y1:418 Y2:449
Here's your prune juice, darling.

760
01:06:02,366 --> 01:06:04,300  X1:243 X2:460 Y1:418 Y2:445
Leave the bottle.

761
01:06:04,368 --> 01:06:05,801  X1:274 X2:428 Y1:418 Y2:445
Who's that?

762
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:12,601  X1:161 X2:542 Y1:418 Y2:449
Hello. Is Melvin Smiley here?

763
01:06:12,676 --> 01:06:15,975  X1:168 X2:533 Y1:382 Y2:445
We're Melvin's coworkers.
We work in the same office.

764
01:06:16,046 --> 01:06:17,604  X1:305 X2:398 Y1:418 Y2:449
Really?

765
01:06:17,681 --> 01:06:22,015  X1:165 X2:536 Y1:380 Y2:449
- Is that chicken I smell?
- Have you eaten? - Lunch?

766
01:06:22,086 --> 01:06:25,578  X1:180 X2:522 Y1:382 Y2:449
I haven't eaten all day.
Could you eat something?

767
01:06:25,656 --> 01:06:28,819  X1:136 X2:564 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Come on.
- You're so gracious. Thank you.

768
01:06:28,893 --> 01:06:28,926  X1:107 X2:598 Y1:382 Y2:449
He's a devoted colleague. A man who
works for the betterment of society.

769
01:06:28,926 --> 01:06:33,761  X1:107 X2:598 Y1:382 Y2:449
He's a devoted colleague. A man who
works for the betterment of society.

770
01:06:33,831 --> 01:06:36,664  X1:088 X2:614 Y1:418 Y2:449
So why does Melvin work on weekends?

771
01:06:36,734 --> 01:06:38,668  X1:129 X2:573 Y1:418 Y2:445
He works with the homeless a lot.

772
01:06:38,736 --> 01:06:41,068  X1:111 X2:593 Y1:418 Y2:449
He sells computers to the homeless?

773
01:06:41,138 --> 01:06:45,472  X1:138 X2:564 Y1:382 Y2:449
You'd be surprised how many
homeless people buy computers.

774
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:46,976  X1:280 X2:423 Y1:418 Y2:449
Oh, really?

775
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:50,813  X1:248 X2:451 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Hello, Melvin.
- Hi, Melvin.

776
01:06:51,682 --> 01:06:54,879  X1:120 X2:582 Y1:418 Y2:445
You wanna talk about this outside?

777
01:06:54,952 --> 01:06:58,251  X1:177 X2:525 Y1:382 Y2:449
Sit down, Melvin.
I'd like to propose a toast.

778
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:03,926  X1:152 X2:548 Y1:382 Y2:449
To my wife. A lovely woman,
who for the past eight years...

779
01:07:03,994 --> 01:07:08,158  X1:164 X2:537 Y1:416 Y2:449
has cost me over $200,000...

780
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:10,200  X1:199 X2:502 Y1:418 Y2:449
in plastic surgery bills.

781
01:07:10,267 --> 01:07:12,929  X1:163 X2:538 Y1:382 Y2:449
And what was the end result
of all that surgery?

782
01:07:13,003 --> 01:07:16,370  X1:211 X2:490 Y1:382 Y2:445
A 57-year-old woman
with the face...

783
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,773  X1:241 X2:459 Y1:382 Y2:449
of a beautiful
25-year-old ape.

784
01:07:19,843 --> 01:07:22,403  X1:237 X2:463 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Oh, Morton!
- Shut your pisk!

785
01:07:22,479 --> 01:07:24,879  X1:233 X2:471 Y1:382 Y2:449
I'll have you know
that many men...

786
01:07:24,949 --> 01:07:27,679  X1:216 X2:487 Y1:382 Y2:449
have found me to be
a ravishing creature.

787
01:07:28,852 --> 01:07:30,843  X1:124 X2:579 Y1:418 Y2:449
Don't you think I'm attractive still?

788
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:33,788  X1:198 X2:503 Y1:382 Y2:449
- A ravishing creature?
- Yes. Certainly.

789
01:07:34,758 --> 01:07:36,191  X1:278 X2:421 Y1:418 Y2:449
Yeah, sure.

790
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:40,026  X1:182 X2:521 Y1:418 Y2:449
I agree. You're a creature.

791
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:42,122  X1:198 X2:503 Y1:418 Y2:445
Sit down ! You're drunk.

792
01:07:42,199 --> 01:07:44,429  X1:144 X2:556 Y1:418 Y2:449
To my darling daughter pamela.

793
01:07:44,501 --> 01:07:47,766  X1:260 X2:442 Y1:382 Y2:449
A princess.
My only child.

794
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:50,306  X1:121 X2:580 Y1:418 Y2:449
And the source of constant pride...

795
01:07:50,374 --> 01:07:53,138  X1:156 X2:545 Y1:418 Y2:449
to degenerate, manipulative...

796
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:55,735  X1:110 X2:592 Y1:418 Y2:449
gold-digging leeches the world over.

797
01:07:55,813 --> 01:08:00,250  X1:112 X2:588 Y1:382 Y2:449
Which leads me
to my would-be son-in-law Melvin...

798
01:08:00,317 --> 01:08:03,809  X1:163 X2:537 Y1:382 Y2:449
who's very charming
in a "Rain Man" kind of way.

799
01:08:03,887 --> 01:08:08,119  X1:146 X2:556 Y1:382 Y2:449
But obviously not good enough
for some parties.

800
01:08:08,192 --> 01:08:11,127  X1:148 X2:551 Y1:382 Y2:449
- I think you better--
- Sit down and shut your pisk.

801
01:08:11,195 --> 01:08:15,063  X1:170 X2:530 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Morton, please. Sit down!
- Where was l?

802
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:18,795  X1:116 X2:586 Y1:382 Y2:449
The first thing we do when we meet
this young man is have a big fight.

803
01:08:18,869 --> 01:08:22,168  X1:129 X2:572 Y1:382 Y2:449
Then the young man comes to me
like Sidney poitier...

804
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:24,400  X1:116 X2:586 Y1:418 Y2:449
in "Guess Who's Coming to dinner."

805
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,602  X1:193 X2:506 Y1:382 Y2:449
A fine film, I might add.
And he proclaims...

806
01:08:26,677 --> 01:08:30,636  X1:149 X2:554 Y1:382 Y2:449
"I will not marry your daughter
unless I have your blessing."

807
01:08:30,714 --> 01:08:33,274  X1:245 X2:456 Y1:418 Y2:449
To which I say...

808
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:35,409  X1:180 X2:520 Y1:418 Y2:449
"She doesn't deserve you.

809
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:39,616  X1:110 X2:592 Y1:382 Y2:445
You deserve to be in an environment
of tolerance and brotherhood."

810
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:44,992  X1:215 X2:486 Y1:382 Y2:445
When I see four men
of different races...

811
01:08:45,062 --> 01:08:49,192  X1:124 X2:580 Y1:382 Y2:445
colors and creeds, sitting together
at the dinner table...

812
01:08:49,266 --> 01:08:52,292  X1:215 X2:486 Y1:418 Y2:449
it fills me with hope.

813
01:08:52,369 --> 01:08:57,204  X1:151 X2:551 Y1:382 Y2:445
You four are what this country
is all about.

814
01:09:03,213 --> 01:09:05,841  X1:224 X2:478 Y1:382 Y2:449
Oh, gross!
You nasty mother--

815
01:09:14,792 --> 01:09:17,693  X1:169 X2:533 Y1:382 Y2:449
It's bonus time,
and guess who's the bonus.

816
01:09:21,632 --> 01:09:24,032  X1:135 X2:568 Y1:418 Y2:449
Yo, Mel. You pissed at me, baby?

817
01:09:24,101 --> 01:09:26,296  X1:154 X2:546 Y1:382 Y2:449
Backstabbing motherfucker.
We're supposed to be friends.

818
01:09:33,877 --> 01:09:38,007  X1:108 X2:593 Y1:382 Y2:449
We're still friends. I just need space.
I still love you, baby.

819
01:09:40,084 --> 01:09:42,052  X1:106 X2:595 Y1:418 Y2:449
Yeah, just like you loved Gump, huh?

820
01:09:43,153 --> 01:09:46,054  X1:149 X2:553 Y1:418 Y2:449
It's every man for himself, Mel.

821
01:09:51,695 --> 01:09:54,562  X1:200 X2:503 Y1:382 Y2:449
Move it out.
Freddy, you're with me.

822
01:10:00,304 --> 01:10:02,670  X1:301 X2:401 Y1:382 Y2:445
- pam?
- Yeah?

823
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,538  X1:107 X2:594 Y1:382 Y2:445
- Were you gonna break up with me?
- Yeah.

824
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:13,511  X1:173 X2:527 Y1:382 Y2:445
- I guess this is good-bye.
- Yes. Yes.

825
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:15,518  X1:188 X2:514 Y1:418 Y2:449
I'm sorry about the meal.

826
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:18,077  X1:198 X2:502 Y1:418 Y2:449
Things could be worse.

827
01:10:44,047 --> 01:10:45,742  X1:232 X2:471 Y1:418 Y2:449
He's getting away!

828
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:50,750  X1:246 X2:455 Y1:418 Y2:449
Come on, move!

829
01:10:59,062 --> 01:11:00,996  X1:229 X2:474 Y1:418 Y2:449
"Don'f worry, baby.

830
01:11:01,064 --> 01:11:03,828  X1:195 X2:508 Y1:382 Y2:445
This'll shave four hours
off our drive."

831
01:11:03,901 --> 01:11:07,166  X1:123 X2:578 Y1:382 Y2:449
We're right back where we started,
you fucking idiot!

832
01:11:08,238 --> 01:11:12,004  X1:161 X2:539 Y1:382 Y2:449
He's an animal.
I should've found the money.

833
01:11:12,075 --> 01:11:15,670  X1:119 X2:583 Y1:382 Y2:449
Don't worry. He won't hurt her now.
She's the only insurance he's got.

834
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:35,324  X1:235 X2:465 Y1:418 Y2:445
That was intense!

835
01:12:35,392 --> 01:12:37,383  X1:238 X2:463 Y1:418 Y2:449
I'll be right back.

836
01:12:39,129 --> 01:12:40,824  X1:293 X2:409 Y1:418 Y2:449
Oh, God!

837
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,423  X1:191 X2:510 Y1:382 Y2:445
- I think I broke my leg!
- Shit.

838
01:13:12,195 --> 01:13:15,289  X1:174 X2:529 Y1:382 Y2:449
Nice fuckin' driving, Mario.
Now get us out of here!

839
01:13:15,365 --> 01:13:18,664  X1:194 X2:508 Y1:418 Y2:449
You have Triple-A card?

840
01:13:18,735 --> 01:13:21,226  X1:264 X2:438 Y1:418 Y2:449
Mine expired.

841
01:13:24,474 --> 01:13:26,305  X1:251 X2:450 Y1:418 Y2:449
He's got a gun.

842
01:13:31,148 --> 01:13:34,242  X1:076 X2:624 Y1:382 Y2:445
- You were gonna keep this, weren't you?
- He wanted it.

843
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:38,380  X1:116 X2:585 Y1:418 Y2:449
You should be ashamed of yourself.

844
01:13:43,827 --> 01:13:48,423  X1:166 X2:536 Y1:382 Y2:449
Melvin, I'm sorry.
Can we just talk about this?

845
01:13:48,498 --> 01:13:49,931  X1:282 X2:420 Y1:418 Y2:449
I love you !

846
01:13:52,202 --> 01:13:53,635  X1:321 X2:381 Y1:418 Y2:445
Shit!

847
01:14:06,917 --> 01:14:09,044  X1:275 X2:428 Y1:418 Y2:445
I wanted it?

848
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:13,055  X1:096 X2:608 Y1:382 Y2:449
If you would've stayed your narrow ass
on the freeway like I told you to...

849
01:14:13,123 --> 01:14:15,057  X1:158 X2:542 Y1:418 Y2:449
this wouldn't have happened.

850
01:14:23,166 --> 01:14:27,296  X1:113 X2:589 Y1:382 Y2:449
You wouldn't happen to know
where Melvin is headed, would you?

851
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:37,503  X1:067 X2:634 Y1:382 Y2:449
You wouldn't happen to know
where Melvin might be headed, would you?

852
01:14:39,049 --> 01:14:40,482  X1:275 X2:427 Y1:418 Y2:449
Would you?

853
01:14:42,786 --> 01:14:46,313  X1:125 X2:575 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Whaf happens now?
- I dro, you off and you go home.

854
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:48,881  X1:201 X2:501 Y1:382 Y2:449
No, I mean,
what happens with us?

855
01:14:59,403 --> 01:15:02,270  X1:096 X2:606 Y1:382 Y2:449
If you're gonna be with me, there are
certain things you need to understand.

856
01:15:02,339 --> 01:15:04,534  X1:220 X2:483 Y1:418 Y2:445
I'm a contract killer.

857
01:15:04,608 --> 01:15:08,635  X1:120 X2:580 Y1:382 Y2:449
I murder people for money.
So far they've all been bad people.

858
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:12,239  X1:119 X2:582 Y1:382 Y2:445
Give or take a few obnoxious ones.
That's what I do.

859
01:15:12,315 --> 01:15:15,250  X1:106 X2:593 Y1:382 Y2:445
- It's the only thing that I'm good at.
- I'm cool with that.

860
01:15:15,318 --> 01:15:17,548  X1:148 X2:552 Y1:382 Y2:449
If you stay with me,
your life's gonna be in danger.

861
01:15:17,621 --> 01:15:20,215  X1:166 X2:535 Y1:382 Y2:449
A constant adrenaline rush?
Are you kidding?

862
01:15:20,290 --> 01:15:23,453  X1:188 X2:514 Y1:382 Y2:449
- I like it.
- Understand this, okay?

863
01:15:23,527 --> 01:15:28,726  X1:123 X2:581 Y1:382 Y2:449
I positively cannot be the only one
falling in love in this relationship.

864
01:15:28,799 --> 01:15:32,428  X1:178 X2:521 Y1:382 Y2:449
- It's got to be mutual.
- I'm feeling you, Skipper.

865
01:15:35,372 --> 01:15:37,363  X1:177 X2:526 Y1:418 Y2:449
I'm gonna return this tape.

866
01:15:37,441 --> 01:15:41,901  X1:084 X2:617 Y1:382 Y2:449
When I come back, if you really want to,
we'll disappear together.

867
01:16:18,915 --> 01:16:21,145  X1:237 X2:464 Y1:418 Y2:449
Stay still. please.

868
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:25,615  X1:096 X2:606 Y1:382 Y2:445
Oh, God. I'm gonna get us out of here.
Just calm down. please.

869
01:16:25,689 --> 01:16:27,623  X1:181 X2:520 Y1:418 Y2:445
You don't seem that calm!

870
01:16:34,297 --> 01:16:36,128  X1:294 X2:405 Y1:418 Y2:449
Aw, shit.

871
01:16:36,199 --> 01:16:37,632  X1:285 X2:417 Y1:418 Y2:449
You okay?

872
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:41,570  X1:123 X2:578 Y1:418 Y2:449
All right. We can get out the back.

873
01:16:49,813 --> 01:16:53,271  X1:210 X2:492 Y1:382 Y2:445
Come on. It's safe.
Just don't look down.

874
01:16:57,888 --> 01:16:59,321  X1:261 X2:440 Y1:418 Y2:449
Skipper, look.

875
01:17:01,057 --> 01:17:03,150  X1:181 X2:520 Y1:382 Y2:449
Oh, shit.
You gotta get out of here.

876
01:17:03,226 --> 01:17:06,320  X1:155 X2:547 Y1:382 Y2:449
Meet me by the video store.
I gotta deal with this guy. Go!

877
01:19:43,186 --> 01:19:48,351  X1:115 X2:588 Y1:382 Y2:449
The most expensive stand-up in the
history of motion picture marketing.

878
01:19:48,425 --> 01:19:51,019  X1:287 X2:413 Y1:418 Y2:445
Awesome.

879
01:20:02,038 --> 01:20:04,029  X1:305 X2:396 Y1:418 Y2:449
Smiley.

880
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:10,279  X1:155 X2:547 Y1:418 Y2:449
Here's your fuckin' tape back.

881
01:20:12,749 --> 01:20:14,876  X1:257 X2:446 Y1:418 Y2:445
Let's see here.

882
01:20:16,653 --> 01:20:18,587  X1:231 X2:471 Y1:418 Y2:449
Ooh, late charges.

883
01:20:21,458 --> 01:20:23,824  X1:271 X2:431 Y1:418 Y2:445
What's this?

884
01:20:23,893 --> 01:20:27,158  X1:201 X2:500 Y1:382 Y2:449
Tape's not rewound?
That's gonna cost you!

885
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:29,892  X1:139 X2:563 Y1:418 Y2:449
I've taken a lot of shit from you.

886
01:20:29,966 --> 01:20:32,833  X1:152 X2:551 Y1:382 Y2:449
I put up with your high prices,
your lousy selection.

887
01:20:32,902 --> 01:20:35,530  X1:190 X2:510 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Your rude phone calls.
- Sorry about that.

888
01:20:35,605 --> 01:20:38,039  X1:154 X2:547 Y1:382 Y2:445
- I want to tell you one thing.
- What?

889
01:20:38,108 --> 01:20:41,168  X1:121 X2:581 Y1:382 Y2:449
I will never rent tapes
from this store again, you snotty--

890
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:46,246  X1:147 X2:556 Y1:382 Y2:445
I'm gonna finish what I started,
motherfucker.

891
01:20:52,922 --> 01:20:54,890  X1:279 X2:424 Y1:418 Y2:449
No, please.

892
01:20:55,925 --> 01:20:58,155  X1:232 X2:470 Y1:418 Y2:449
Knuckle up, bitch.

893
01:20:58,228 --> 01:21:00,423  X1:202 X2:500 Y1:382 Y2:445
Let's go, motherfucker.
Let's work.

894
01:21:13,176 --> 01:21:15,576  X1:227 X2:475 Y1:382 Y2:449
- Where's the girl?
- I let her go.

895
01:21:19,949 --> 01:21:25,080  X1:110 X2:593 Y1:382 Y2:449
You let that bitch go? I can't believe
how fucking stupid you are, man.

896
01:21:25,155 --> 01:21:27,589  X1:196 X2:505 Y1:382 Y2:449
- She ain't no bitch.
- Oh, she's not a bitch.

897
01:21:27,657 --> 01:21:32,287  X1:142 X2:560 Y1:382 Y2:449
I see. You like this girl.
Come on! She tricked you, fool.

898
01:21:32,362 --> 01:21:35,126  X1:103 X2:597 Y1:382 Y2:449
Just another ho manipulating
your sorry ass to get what she wants.

899
01:21:36,466 --> 01:21:38,434  X1:154 X2:546 Y1:382 Y2:449
You don't know what you're
talking about. That's not true.

900
01:21:38,501 --> 01:21:42,130  X1:161 X2:542 Y1:382 Y2:449
Haven't I taught you nothin'?
She don't like you.

901
01:21:42,205 --> 01:21:44,469  X1:159 X2:543 Y1:418 Y2:449
Hell, I don't fucking like you.

902
01:22:04,027 --> 01:22:08,259  X1:136 X2:564 Y1:382 Y2:449
You was nothin'. I got you a job,
taught you everything you know.

903
01:22:09,966 --> 01:22:13,993  X1:102 X2:599 Y1:382 Y2:449
Remember that promise I made about
my boat? I lied. You ain't getting shit.

904
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:15,594  X1:227 X2:475 Y1:418 Y2:449
I don't give a fuck!

905
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:06,521  X1:252 X2:449 Y1:418 Y2:445
Son of a bitch !

906
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:13,454  X1:234 X2:466 Y1:418 Y2:445
Ain't that a bitch !

907
01:23:17,567 --> 01:23:21,560  X1:183 X2:518 Y1:382 Y2:449
All I wanted to do
was to sail my boat, man.

908
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:23,729  X1:281 X2:421 Y1:418 Y2:445
You know?

909
01:23:24,741 --> 01:23:26,675  X1:208 X2:493 Y1:418 Y2:449
Navigate by the stars.

910
01:23:27,911 --> 01:23:31,142  X1:148 X2:553 Y1:382 Y2:449
See dolphins racing alongside,
you know?

911
01:23:31,214 --> 01:23:33,205  X1:160 X2:542 Y1:418 Y2:449
Maybe even kill a few of 'em.

912
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:38,184  X1:290 X2:410 Y1:418 Y2:449
Yo, Mel...

913
01:23:39,088 --> 01:23:41,022  X1:225 X2:476 Y1:418 Y2:445
I can almost see it.

914
01:23:41,925 --> 01:23:44,155  X1:212 X2:490 Y1:418 Y2:449
It's fucking beautiful.

915
01:23:49,933 --> 01:23:51,992  X1:247 X2:455 Y1:418 Y2:449
I'm here, buddy.

916
01:23:52,068 --> 01:23:54,229  X1:206 X2:496 Y1:418 Y2:445
I can't see it no more.

917
01:23:55,772 --> 01:23:58,332  X1:232 X2:469 Y1:382 Y2:449
I can see it.
You're there, man.

918
01:23:59,242 --> 01:24:02,268  X1:192 X2:511 Y1:382 Y2:449
You're there now.
Right there on the deck.

919
01:24:02,345 --> 01:24:05,246  X1:188 X2:514 Y1:382 Y2:445
It's just you and the sea.
One on one.

920
01:24:06,683 --> 01:24:08,844  X1:245 X2:455 Y1:418 Y2:445
You're free now.

921
01:26:07,637 --> 01:26:08,899  X1:316 X2:385 Y1:418 Y2:449
Why?

922
01:26:16,846 --> 01:26:21,249  X1:093 X2:609 Y1:382 Y2:449
That is so cool. I can't believe they're
making a movie about your kidnapping.

923
01:26:21,317 --> 01:26:23,979  X1:118 X2:585 Y1:418 Y2:449
My dad's in L.A. finalizing the deal.

924
01:26:24,053 --> 01:26:27,147  X1:171 X2:529 Y1:382 Y2:449
This is such a story.
Your dad was totally broke.

925
01:26:27,223 --> 01:26:30,681  X1:083 X2:619 Y1:382 Y2:449
Then you get kidnapped and now they're
gonna make a big Hollywood movie?

926
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,490  X1:168 X2:532 Y1:418 Y2:449
Your dad must be so happy.

927
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:36,623  X1:125 X2:576 Y1:382 Y2:449
Yeah, everything's back to normal.
My ride's here. I gotta go.

928
01:26:47,643 --> 01:26:49,076  X1:203 X2:500 Y1:418 Y2:449
Straight home, ma'am?

929
01:26:49,145 --> 01:26:52,546  X1:125 X2:579 Y1:382 Y2:445
Or would you like to just get away
from it all?

930
01:27:12,935 --> 01:27:15,426  X1:182 X2:519 Y1:382 Y2:449
- I don't understand.
- Thanks, Vince. Let's go.

931
01:27:15,505 --> 01:27:17,473  X1:253 X2:447 Y1:418 Y2:449
You got it, kid.

932
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:22,669  X1:113 X2:588 Y1:382 Y2:449
You know your dad's movie display?
It was really well made.

933
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:40,528  X1:301 X2:401 Y1:382 Y2:445
- So?
- Yeah?

934
01:27:40,596 --> 01:27:42,530  X1:131 X2:571 Y1:418 Y2:449
Are we gonna disappear or what?

935
01:27:42,598 --> 01:27:44,532  X1:249 X2:452 Y1:418 Y2:445
You're the man.
