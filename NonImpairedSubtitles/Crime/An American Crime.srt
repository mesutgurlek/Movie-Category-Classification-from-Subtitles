1
00:00:26,212 --> 00:00:29,811
The following is an interpretation
of events based on..

2
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:33,411
Baniszewski v. The State of Indiana, 1966.

3
00:00:33,412 --> 00:00:39,066
All testimonies comes
from court transcripts.

4
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:48,586
I used to love the carnival.

5
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:52,970
Daddy worked all the fairs
selling pretzel’s...

6
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:55,143
and candy apple.

7
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:58,186
Always looking for something better.

8
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:01,706
Sometimes mama would follow him...

9
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:04,899
sometimes he even take us.

10
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:07,350
It was always a new adventure...

11
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:10,142
with a whole new family,
every time.

12
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:11,730
I figured Jennie and me, were...

13
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:15,462
the luckiest girls in the world.
with a life like that.

14
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:18,945
My favorite was the merry-go-round...

15
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:22,250
Maybe I was a little
old for it, but...

16
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:25,742
all those other rides
they scared me.

17
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,463
The merry-go-round, just goes
round and round, and up and down.

18
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,780
It don't go anywhere,
but I always felt save.

19
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,303
That's me on the left.

20
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,582
Sylvia.

21
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,545
And that's my story.

22
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:23,939
I'm a Prostitute and proud of it.

23
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,380
Would you please state your name.

24
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:48,247
Lester Likens.

25
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:50,527
Are you married to Betty Likens?

26
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:52,127
Yes.

27
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:54,967
Did you and your wife ever separate?

28
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:56,527
Yes.

29
00:02:56,528 --> 00:02:59,327
What period of time did that occur?

30
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:02,887
The last week in June 1965.

31
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:06,887
She was at Euclid street,
and I was in Lebanon, Indiana.

32
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:08,807
Where were the children?

33
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:12,380
Jennie Faye and Silvia Marie
was with her.

34
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:19,380
Do you think,
we'll make new friends?

35
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:21,166
Sure we will.

36
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,846
Well, maybe there'll be
some cute boys this time.

37
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:25,326
They're supposed to be cute.

38
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:28,785
Come on girls, you don't
wanna be late now for church.

39
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:31,686
Hey!

40
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:32,886
Daddy?

41
00:03:32,887 --> 00:03:35,246
- Hey, Jennie.
- What're you doing here?

42
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:37,465
Well, I missed you girls.

43
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:40,222
Hi Betty, can I talk
to for a minute?

44
00:03:41,727 --> 00:03:44,546
You know, I've been talking
to a Horst and he says...

45
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:47,166
that we could maybe play our own
band at the state-fair this year.

46
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:48,766
Then maybe we could make
enough money to go on tour.

47
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:50,726
I told Lester, that I
can't do it anymore...

48
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:52,165
not with the girls.

49
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,245
Maybe my mother will take them.

50
00:03:54,246 --> 00:03:56,325
I can't move them up there again.

51
00:03:56,326 --> 00:03:59,205
They haven't even had a chance
to make friends down here yet.

52
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:03,045
Betty, maybe we wouldn't fight
as much, without the kids.

53
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:04,661
Mama?

54
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:07,965
You two, go on ahead and
catch the church bus home.

55
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:10,741
I've gotta settle things
with your father.

56
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:21,205
See what love the
father has given us...

57
00:04:21,206 --> 00:04:24,504
and we are called children of god.

58
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:28,125
And so we are!

59
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:31,124
But how does a child,
come on to his father?

60
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,423
How does the father,
come on to the child?

61
00:04:34,685 --> 00:04:38,164
Christ said: I am the way.
The truth, the live and love.

62
00:04:38,165 --> 00:04:42,578
Come on to the father, but by me.

63
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:46,900
Our families,
our fathers, our mothers.

64
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:50,724
It is only through Christ,
that we find our father.

65
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:53,978
And it's only through Christ,
that we find each other.

66
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:04,084
Oh, that's a beautiful dress, Hope.

67
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:05,984
Oh, thank you, Gertrude.

68
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:09,523
And huh... I'm feeling much
better, with my new medicine...

69
00:05:09,524 --> 00:05:12,363
and... you know anybody, that
needs ironing to be done...

70
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:13,963
I'd appreciate the work.

71
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:15,533
I'll do that.

72
00:05:15,644 --> 00:05:17,543
Thank you.

73
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:25,763
What happened to your leg?

74
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:27,603
That's not nice, Shirley!

75
00:05:27,604 --> 00:05:29,843
That's alright, she's used to it.

76
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:32,414
- So what is it?
- Polio.

77
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:34,763
Polio?

78
00:05:34,764 --> 00:05:36,583
Does that hurt?

79
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:38,977
Our mama is a sick too.

80
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,692
All right girls!

81
00:05:42,484 --> 00:05:43,923
We gotta go.

82
00:05:43,924 --> 00:05:45,822
Can they come with us?

83
00:05:46,203 --> 00:05:48,402
You wanna come? We've got
some friends coming over...

84
00:05:48,403 --> 00:05:51,322
and you can meet our older sister.

85
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:53,278
- Let's do.
- Sure!

86
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:10,802
Guess who got stuck with
an extra shift at work?

87
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,402
- Did you get paid?
- Mm'hm.

88
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:14,722
Got a little extra for dinner.

89
00:06:14,723 --> 00:06:16,482
Here, take the baby.

90
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:18,336
Where'd they come from?

91
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:20,082
What's this?

92
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,641
We invited them to stay and play.

93
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:24,521
We'll be quiet.

94
00:06:24,522 --> 00:06:26,694
All right, make sure of it.

95
00:06:30,002 --> 00:06:32,174
I really like this song.

96
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:34,161
What's your dad do?

97
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:36,081
He is cop, they are divorced.

98
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:37,241
Do you miss him any?

99
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:38,841
Nah, I just miss his money.

100
00:06:38,842 --> 00:06:40,841
- But, Paula!
- Well, it's true.

101
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:42,721
Maybe, if he's more
regular with his support...

102
00:06:42,722 --> 00:06:44,201
Mom wouldn't be so sick...

103
00:06:44,202 --> 00:06:46,121
and I wouldn't have to work so hard.

104
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:47,921
Little Kenny's got a different daddy.

105
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:49,801
- Who's little Kenny?
- The baby.

106
00:06:49,802 --> 00:06:51,761
But we ain't supposed
to talk about that.

107
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:53,331
Auh!

108
00:06:54,362 --> 00:06:55,561
Finished!

109
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:57,481
Wow! You should do this for a living.

110
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,160
Yeah, if she was old enough.

111
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:00,560
You want me to do yours?

112
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:02,080
Oh, no, thanks.

113
00:07:02,081 --> 00:07:03,560
Yeah, she's the pretty one.

114
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:05,680
Yeah, she's got nice hair.

115
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:07,880
- I'm pretty too.
- The hell you are!

116
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:09,960
Oh, let me see that brush.

117
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:12,840
I tell you what?
Let's go get a coke.

118
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:15,880
My boyfriend works over at the
liquor store, get him to buy a couple.

119
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:17,480
Sure.

120
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:19,539
You girls behave!

121
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:22,200
We're goin' to groceries.

122
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:24,480
Tell Andy, he owes me
for little Kenny!

123
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:26,200
And don't be waistin'
time on that bag-boy.

124
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:27,920
He ain't a bag-boy, Mama!

125
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:30,093
Sort of wasted space.

126
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:33,280
- She don't like my boyfriend.
- Yeah, I can see that.

127
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:35,453
Hey, Johnny, quit it!

128
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,733
Sorry, Mrs. Doyle.

129
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,879
Hey!

130
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,119
You weren't at church today.

131
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,439
Coy and I headin' over there now.

132
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,009
Yeah, you better be.

133
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,019
Let's get outta here.

134
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,719
That's my sister Stephanie,
she's big help around the house...

135
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,176
when she ain't wasting time
with her boyfriend Coy.

136
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,579
Oh, God.

137
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,199
Hey, Paula.

138
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,919
Mama was asking you for her money.

139
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,519
I bet she was.

140
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,919
Who's your friend?

141
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,319
Sylvia, but she don't talk to trash.

142
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,439
Excuse me.

143
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,159
That's my mama's ex boyfriend.

144
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,730
He's only 6 years older than me.

145
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,978
Just like her mom.

146
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,398
That's him.

147
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,412
That's my Bradley.

148
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,131
He's real cute.

149
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:26,318
We got both to be real
careful about it.

150
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,093
Why?

151
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,213
Because he's married.

152
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,558
I'm not even shittin' you, no!

153
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,174
Paula!

154
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,496
Don't tell me you never
had a boyfriend.

155
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:44,248
Ah, well, there was this guy
in California, but...

156
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:46,758
I guess it was nothing.

157
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,250
Well, at least you did
more than just kiss, huh?

158
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,757
Well, aren't you just so damn pure.

159
00:08:53,758 --> 00:08:55,816
Oh, come on.

160
00:08:59,118 --> 00:09:00,653
Let's go!

161
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:05,677
<i>This is Pleiku,
250 miles north of Saigon.</i>

162
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,037
<i>The Air Force Base,
that was threatened...</i>

163
00:09:07,038 --> 00:09:09,335
<i>by Communist Guerillas...</i>

164
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:26,157
Marie!

165
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:27,877
I need you to feed little Kenny.

166
00:09:27,878 --> 00:09:31,356
If I don't get this ironing to
Mrs. Duke by four, I wont get a tip.

167
00:09:31,357 --> 00:09:33,396
- We're all out of milk.
- Well, then get some.

168
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:35,356
They wont give us no more
credit at the store.

169
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,609
They will, if you take the baby.

170
00:09:37,717 --> 00:09:39,236
Hello!

171
00:09:39,237 --> 00:09:41,036
Oh, hi, I'm sorry.

172
00:09:41,037 --> 00:09:43,573
Huh, somebody said they
saw my girls here.

173
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:46,636
You got no family here in Indy?

174
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:49,731
Well, not that I could leave'm with.

175
00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:52,556
'Cause of them or you?

176
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:54,536
A little of both.

177
00:09:55,237 --> 00:09:57,516
Hi, Mrs. Baniszewski,
is Shirley and Marie here?

178
00:09:57,517 --> 00:09:58,836
Upstairs.

179
00:09:58,837 --> 00:10:00,736
Shut the door!

180
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,649
Looks like, you've got kids running
in and outta here, all day long.

181
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:14,529
Why don't you leave Sylvia
and Jenny, here with me?

182
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,115
No, I... I couldn't do that.

183
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:22,395
I got six kids, two more
wont make a difference.

184
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:24,887
Yeah, I guess that's true.

185
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,929
<i>20 dollars a week and
you don't have to worry.</i>

186
00:10:37,356 --> 00:10:39,608
You'd be helping me out too.

187
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,884
I could talk to
my wife about it.

188
00:10:46,035 --> 00:10:48,730
Something to consider.

189
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,730
Ah-ha...

190
00:10:52,515 --> 00:10:56,434
So, you'd never met Gertrude
Baniszewski before that day?

191
00:10:56,435 --> 00:10:58,114
No, Sir.

192
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,687
But, you were willing to leave your
children, with a complete stranger?

193
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,114
Well, like I said, huh...

194
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:07,354
we got to talking and...

195
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:10,634
she openly admitted, that she
would take care of the children...

196
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:13,524
and treat them like
they were her own.

197
00:11:14,795 --> 00:11:16,994
<i>Okay! Here is 20 now...</i>

198
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:19,994
and huh... you'll have the next
payment in a week, Thursday.

199
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:21,513
I'll need that money.

200
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,913
You will have it.

201
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:24,793
Johnny, bring the box upstairs!

202
00:11:24,794 --> 00:11:26,833
Okay, sweetheart,
that's real nice.

203
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,713
I sure don't want you go.

204
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:31,473
The circuit will be down and
done, at the end of September.

205
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:33,033
That's only 2 months.

206
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:36,253
And I promise, I will be back,
and get you girls then.

207
00:11:36,514 --> 00:11:39,812
Okay, kids.
Goodbye, Jenny, Cookie.

208
00:11:40,274 --> 00:11:41,993
- You be good!
- Okay.

209
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:43,768
Bye-bye.

210
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:46,153
Bye.

211
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:48,087
Bye, girls.

212
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:51,473
You girls make sure you get
everything you need.

213
00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:52,963
Thank you.

214
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:55,393
Well, come on!

215
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:57,293
We'll help you unpack.

216
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:03,892
Wait, I'll help you.

217
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:24,472
Nothing to be nervous about.

218
00:12:24,473 --> 00:12:27,072
Everyone's really nice here.
I promise.

219
00:12:27,073 --> 00:12:30,472
Hey, Paula, get your cherry
popped, this summer?

220
00:12:30,473 --> 00:12:33,192
You sure didn't, Teddy,
not with a face like that.

221
00:12:33,193 --> 00:12:34,992
Hey, come on Paula,
you know he's just playing.

222
00:12:34,993 --> 00:12:37,671
So, why don't you
play with yourselves?

223
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:40,191
Coy is okay, but Teddy is
a goddamn delinquent.

224
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,311
Paula!

225
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:44,151
Those guys, they're always
messing with somebody.

226
00:12:44,152 --> 00:12:46,111
I'm sure, she will be okay.

227
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:49,791
- You live with Paula and them?
- Yeah, for a bid, I guess.

228
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:53,045
Yeah, I saw you the other day.

229
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:55,431
I live right around the corner,
I'm Ricky Hobbs.

230
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:56,711
Sylvia.

231
00:12:56,712 --> 00:12:58,631
Hey, there's a football game
this weekend...

232
00:12:58,632 --> 00:13:00,471
if you'd be interested in that at all.

233
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:02,391
Oh, I don't like that much football.

234
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:04,291
Sylvia, come on!

235
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:06,446
Good bye!

236
00:13:10,112 --> 00:13:11,591
It's me!

237
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:13,710
Hope, you brought my money.

238
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:16,167
Nice to see you too.

239
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:19,606
Came by to see my baby.

240
00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:27,750
Hi!

241
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:29,366
Hey!

242
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:32,270
Leave him!

243
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:36,446
Well, I got my call-up papers.
I have to go to boot-camp soon.

244
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:41,004
Put him back in.

245
00:13:43,191 --> 00:13:46,330
It took me all day to quiet him.

246
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:50,429
- Not in front of the baby!
- Why? He don't care.

247
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,283
I do!

248
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,789
Listen, I'll be getting
a paycheck.

249
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,121
So, you'll be getting
payments regularly.

250
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,040
Who's gonna take care of you?

251
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,389
Well, actually I was wondering...

252
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,629
if I could borrow a few dollars...

253
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,247
so I could visit my brother
in Lebanon, before I leave.

254
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,749
If I had the money,
I'd give it to you.

255
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,509
I saw your new boarders.

256
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,309
Don't tell me, you're
doing that for charity.

257
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,509
I had to take them in,
because of you.

258
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,308
I ain't paying for
another man's kids.

259
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:30,162
You ain't paying for no...

260
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:36,567
I'm sorry, Gertie.

261
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:38,848
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:49,028
So, how was the
first day at school?

263
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:51,548
Well, I made
a couple friends.

264
00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:55,148
See, we're not such bad people,
here on the Southside.

265
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:58,028
Can you, pick up the kids
and bring'm home?

266
00:14:58,029 --> 00:14:59,588
There's something I have
to take care of.

267
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:00,788
Yeah, is everything alright?

268
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:03,468
Just tell mama, I picked up
an extra shift at work.

269
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,163
Sure.

270
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:09,487
You know, Paula is looking more
and more like you everyday.

271
00:15:10,348 --> 00:15:12,327
Lucky girl.

272
00:15:13,628 --> 00:15:16,005
Should watch her, though.

273
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:19,157
She's been hanging out
with Bradley again.

274
00:15:19,908 --> 00:15:22,227
I hate to think, what'll happen.

275
00:15:22,228 --> 00:15:24,878
His wife's got a bad temper.

276
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:35,357
You think, that I can
get that money?

277
00:15:39,668 --> 00:15:42,557
<i>There's a 20 in the top drawer.</i>

278
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:03,786
Where do you live Mrs. Doyle?

279
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:05,866
3848 East New York.

280
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:08,146
You can almost reach out of
your dining room window...

281
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:10,106
and touch Baniszewski's
kitchen, can't you?

282
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:11,946
It's not that close.

283
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:13,906
Because of the experience,
that you saw...

284
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:16,106
Mrs. Baniszewski having there.

285
00:16:16,107 --> 00:16:19,167
Did you develop any bias, or
prejudice against her?

286
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:21,905
No, I felt sorry for the lady.

287
00:16:21,906 --> 00:16:24,825
I felt she was a hard working
woman, with all them kids.

288
00:16:24,826 --> 00:16:28,398
Ever entertain any guilt feelings,
or animosity towards her?

289
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:31,145
Oh, no, I can't judge her.

290
00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:33,204
I beg your pardon?

291
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,917
I can't judge her.

292
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:41,040
- Would you like to say prayer, Sylvia?
- Sure.

293
00:16:42,426 --> 00:16:44,505
Bless this food we eat,
and release...

294
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:46,625
us from our sins, amen.

295
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:48,559
Amen!

296
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:54,825
Somebody get out there,
and feed that dog!

297
00:16:54,826 --> 00:16:56,725
Yeah, mama.

298
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:02,664
Sorry, I'm late.

299
00:17:02,665 --> 00:17:04,484
Where you been?

300
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:07,879
I took up the shift
for Ellen.

301
00:17:09,225 --> 00:17:11,504
I told you, I didn't want you
to see that boy anymore.

302
00:17:11,505 --> 00:17:13,424
- and I mean it.
- I didn't.

303
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:15,836
Don't lie to me, Paula.

304
00:17:16,065 --> 00:17:18,920
What? Was he here?
Did Andy say something?

305
00:17:19,225 --> 00:17:21,344
- That's none of your business.
- Yeah, you just don't want...

306
00:17:21,345 --> 00:17:24,040
me to make the same
mistakes, you've made.

307
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:34,874
I said, feed that dog!

308
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:41,161
Johnny, feed the dog!

309
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,956
What's wrong, Paula?

310
00:17:56,824 --> 00:17:59,554
I've got problems, Sylvia.

311
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:02,641
Big problems.

312
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,876
With Bradley?

313
00:18:12,463 --> 00:18:15,557
I went to the doctor, today.

314
00:18:17,503 --> 00:18:19,834
I'm pregnant.

315
00:18:25,703 --> 00:18:28,182
You know the guy is married,

316
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:30,062
I know, he wouldn't want a baby.

317
00:18:30,063 --> 00:18:33,202
I don't know a
damn thing to do.

318
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:38,239
Well, you... you gotta tell him.

319
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,601
I can't.

320
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:43,480
Well, I think you gotta.

321
00:18:45,143 --> 00:18:49,920
You gotta promise me, that you
wont say anything to anybody.

322
00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:55,321
Not a word, until I figure out
what I'm gonna do, okay?

323
00:18:57,022 --> 00:18:59,319
Yeah, I promise.

324
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,960
It's gonna be okay.

325
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,073
Mama?

326
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,868
Mama!

327
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,357
I want you all, upstairs!

328
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,593
Come on.

329
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,272
Except for you two!

330
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,470
I want you down in the basement!

331
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,258
Your daddy’s' check
didn't arrive today.

332
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:57,556
Oh, it's probably just late.

333
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:01,298
I know my Mama, she wouldn't
let him forget.

334
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:03,118
You know what I think?

335
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:07,757
I just took care of you two,
for two weeks... for nothing.

336
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:11,458
I think your mama and daddy...

337
00:21:11,459 --> 00:21:13,756
left you here for good.

338
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:15,698
They wouldn't do that.

339
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:17,917
Keep your mouth shut!

340
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:25,070
Lean over those.

341
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:27,955
Go on, lean over.

342
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,737
- No!
- Come on! Come on.

343
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,977
- Oh, no!
- Get up!

344
00:21:47,978 --> 00:21:49,557
- Gertie!
- Come on!

345
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,910
- No, let go of me!
- Let me get hers.

346
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:15,396
Okay.

347
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:17,911
Come on.

348
00:22:25,497 --> 00:22:27,476
Okay.

349
00:22:33,137 --> 00:22:35,706
I need that money.

350
00:22:52,816 --> 00:22:55,227
Come on, Jennie...

351
00:22:57,656 --> 00:23:01,592
It's not like, we never
had a spanking before.

352
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:07,386
You know, that check's gonna
come tomorrow, I swear.

353
00:23:24,735 --> 00:23:26,974
- Johnny!
- What? Give me the thing back!

354
00:23:26,975 --> 00:23:28,094
Stop that!

355
00:23:28,095 --> 00:23:29,934
Stop, hurting me!

356
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:32,494
I'm 15, I should be able to come.

357
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:35,429
Well, somebody's gotta play
catch with the little ones.

358
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:39,109
I wonder if Bradley
is gonna be there.

359
00:23:40,815 --> 00:23:42,987
<i>Freedom was in jeopardy...</i>

360
00:23:43,415 --> 00:23:46,574
<i>when the struggling
people had been brought...</i>

361
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:50,547
<i>almost to their knees,
by aggression.</i>

362
00:23:50,774 --> 00:23:55,013
<i>When William Westmoreland,
was called to urgent duty.</i>

363
00:23:55,014 --> 00:23:57,826
<i>$20.00.
Pay to: Gertrude Baniszewski</i>

364
00:23:57,827 --> 00:24:00,133
<i>His mission was to deny
aggression, it's conquest.</i>

365
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:02,493
Please give us a call.
Love, Mom and Dad.

366
00:24:02,494 --> 00:24:06,225
<i>It was a mission, simple
enough to stake.</i>

367
00:24:06,574 --> 00:24:09,304
<i>But to execute that mission...</i>

368
00:24:09,374 --> 00:24:11,813
<i>he had to fight the most
complex war...</i>

369
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:13,533
<i>in all American history.</i>

370
00:24:13,534 --> 00:24:15,573
What're you gonna see tonight,
Stephanie?

371
00:24:15,574 --> 00:24:17,493
Well, they ain't gonna
show a movie, Marie.

372
00:24:17,494 --> 00:24:19,053
The only thing she'll be seeing...

373
00:24:19,054 --> 00:24:21,173
is Coys hand, while
she's pushing him away.

374
00:24:21,174 --> 00:24:22,973
I might not be pushing to hard.

375
00:24:22,974 --> 00:24:24,813
Yeah, yeah, princess Grace...

376
00:24:24,814 --> 00:24:26,652
you'd scream, if he
breads on your blouse.

377
00:24:26,653 --> 00:24:28,732
That's not true, Paula,
you know it.

378
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:31,064
Don't give Sylvia
the wrong idea, now.

379
00:24:31,373 --> 00:24:33,784
Look, I shot his eye out.

380
00:24:33,813 --> 00:24:35,052
Why'd you do that?

381
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:36,906
Johnny! Get outta here!

382
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,052
You're dead!

383
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:41,032
That's insane.

384
00:24:42,173 --> 00:24:44,772
Listen, God! This is crap!

385
00:24:44,773 --> 00:24:48,332
There is nothing ever to do,
in this shit-hole town.

386
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,052
It ain't that bad, Teddy.

387
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:51,827
Yeah, it is.

388
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,421
Howdy!

389
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:02,347
You know?
Don't know about you...

390
00:25:02,613 --> 00:25:04,811
but, I'm staying up,
all night, tonight.

391
00:25:04,812 --> 00:25:07,611
He's parents ain't
gonna like that.

392
00:25:07,612 --> 00:25:09,531
They don't give a shit.

393
00:25:09,532 --> 00:25:11,147
Do they?

394
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:14,771
- You like it here?
- Yeah, it's really nice.

395
00:25:14,772 --> 00:25:16,671
He's here.

396
00:25:16,972 --> 00:25:18,611
I'll be right back.

397
00:25:18,612 --> 00:25:20,511
Maybe you shouldn't.

398
00:25:26,572 --> 00:25:28,061
Hey!

399
00:25:28,132 --> 00:25:29,371
Ricky.

400
00:25:29,372 --> 00:25:31,451
You shouldn't sneak
up on girls like that.

401
00:25:31,452 --> 00:25:33,011
I'm sorry.

402
00:25:33,012 --> 00:25:36,251
Hey, the nursery is
around the corner.

403
00:25:36,252 --> 00:25:38,851
You might wanna get back,
before they miss you.

404
00:25:38,852 --> 00:25:40,370
I brought some favors.

405
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:42,190
Give me some of that!

406
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:47,610
What're you doing here?

407
00:25:47,611 --> 00:25:50,386
- I wanted to see you.
- We already talked about this.

408
00:25:51,131 --> 00:25:54,623
I just be right back.

409
00:25:55,691 --> 00:25:57,170
Good!

410
00:25:57,171 --> 00:25:59,690
I already told you, my wife is
back from her cousins house.

411
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,624
So that's it. Okay?

412
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:05,582
Now, be a good girl,
and go play with your friends.

413
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:10,050
You know, my Mama's
been calling you trash.

414
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:12,030
I'm starting to believe her.

415
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:16,130
You should listen to your
mother, Paula, she knows best.

416
00:26:16,131 --> 00:26:18,169
You know, you don't mean that.

417
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,289
Lay off me!

418
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,529
Get off me!

419
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,463
- No!
- Just a kiss.

420
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,929
- Is this what you want, huh?
- Stop it! Stop!

421
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,967
- Hey! Stop!
- Get the hell outta here!

422
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,867
It's private fool, no invitation.

423
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,785
She is pregnant!

424
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:42,180
Don't try to pull that shit on me!
You know, it ain't true.

425
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,749
There ain't no way.

426
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,708
Stay away.

427
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,289
Paula, I'm so sorry.
I just wanted to...

428
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,099
- You're gonna pay for this!
- I... Paula, I just...

429
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,248
Is everything okay?

430
00:27:02,249 --> 00:27:04,660
Would you quit following me!

431
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:17,664
Paula?

432
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:20,728
Honey, you're crying!

433
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:22,947
- Mom!
- What's wrong?

434
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,488
I ain't talking to him anymore.

435
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:31,107
Oh, that's a good girl,
that's a good girl, yes.

436
00:27:32,408 --> 00:27:35,047
You know, we're gonna find
you a good man, Honey.

437
00:27:35,048 --> 00:27:37,778
Not like Andy, or your daddy.

438
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:41,299
But Sylvia said...

439
00:27:41,608 --> 00:27:43,382
What?

440
00:27:46,568 --> 00:27:50,344
She telling horrible lies,
about me.

441
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:55,619
What kind of lies?

442
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:03,706
She's telling everyone,
that I'm a slut.

443
00:28:06,448 --> 00:28:08,407
You should have seen those
boys when they heard...

444
00:28:08,408 --> 00:28:11,023
that I was a slut.

445
00:28:11,847 --> 00:28:14,178
Sylvia said that?.

446
00:28:21,887 --> 00:28:24,025
Don't worry, Baby.

447
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:27,185
Don't worry.

448
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:37,246
Did you ever hear Sylvia, use
any vanity or vulgar language?

449
00:28:37,247 --> 00:28:38,366
No, Sir.

450
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:42,846
Do you know how often Sylvia went
to Sunday school or church?

451
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:44,526
She'd go every time we went.

452
00:28:44,527 --> 00:28:47,046
- Does Sylvia have a bible?
- yes.

453
00:28:47,047 --> 00:28:49,485
Did she dress up nice and clean?

454
00:28:49,486 --> 00:28:50,925
Yes, Sir.

455
00:28:50,926 --> 00:28:55,339
As Mathew said:
"Enter by the narrow gate".

456
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:58,485
For the gate is wide and
the way is easy...

457
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,085
that leads to destruction...

458
00:29:01,086 --> 00:29:04,703
and those who enter by it,
are many.

459
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:09,885
When the gate is narrow
and the way is hard...

460
00:29:09,886 --> 00:29:11,965
that leads to life...

461
00:29:11,966 --> 00:29:16,141
and those who find it, are few.

462
00:29:32,085 --> 00:29:34,735
Jennie, come sit with me!

463
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,139
We gotta go upstairs and change.

464
00:29:58,205 --> 00:30:00,855
I want you all down here.

465
00:30:01,085 --> 00:30:03,176
Family-meeting.

466
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:07,615
It's a lesson for all of you.

467
00:30:23,124 --> 00:30:25,774
You need to apologize to Paula.

468
00:30:32,484 --> 00:30:33,603
But Gertie, I... I don't know...

469
00:30:33,604 --> 00:30:35,803
I want you to apologize.

470
00:30:35,804 --> 00:30:37,896
What she'd done, mama?

471
00:30:38,164 --> 00:30:41,162
She's been spreading lies
about your sister.

472
00:30:41,163 --> 00:30:42,857
I...

473
00:30:49,683 --> 00:30:51,582
I'm sorry.

474
00:30:52,843 --> 00:30:56,482
Paula, you have the right,
to get even.

475
00:30:56,483 --> 00:30:58,541
What you wanna do?

476
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,255
I want you to punish her, mama.

477
00:31:03,683 --> 00:31:05,682
You have to learn to fight
your own battles, baby.

478
00:31:05,683 --> 00:31:08,060
- Get over there.
- Johnny, grab her arms.

479
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:10,162
I said I was sorry.

480
00:31:10,163 --> 00:31:11,982
I don't care what you said.

481
00:31:14,563 --> 00:31:17,292
Go on, she's got it coming.

482
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:24,737
Let her go!

483
00:31:25,442 --> 00:31:27,580
I'm sure, she
can defend herself.

484
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,441
I am not.

485
00:31:36,442 --> 00:31:38,081
I will not.

486
00:31:38,082 --> 00:31:40,459
- I am not.
- She is not!

487
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,295
Damn it!

488
00:31:44,762 --> 00:31:46,900
Enough, that's okay!

489
00:31:49,602 --> 00:31:50,721
Get up.

490
00:31:50,722 --> 00:31:52,416
Get up! Get up!

491
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:58,139
She's learned her lesson.

492
00:31:58,441 --> 00:32:01,216
That's what happens
when you tell lies.

493
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:04,180
Go on!

494
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:16,180
You too, get!

495
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,418
Are you awake?

496
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,858
You're okay?

497
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,570
Did you say your prayers yet?

498
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,850
How about mamas favorite psalm?

499
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,896
Turn on to me, and be
gracious to me, dear lord.

500
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:12,798
for I am lonely and affected.

501
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,518
Release the chalice of my heart...

502
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,931
and bring me out
of my distresses!

503
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:23,778
Consider how many are my foes...

504
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:25,318
Thank you.

505
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:28,174
I will put my fate in thee...

506
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,137
make my life in to a better me.

507
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:37,047
I will not think of the shame.

508
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:40,529
I take refuge in thee!

509
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:46,694
and take thee in greatness be sure.

510
00:33:49,878 --> 00:33:52,414
Amen.

511
00:34:09,198 --> 00:34:11,597
- I hear, your sister's pregnant.
- I see you.

512
00:34:11,598 --> 00:34:14,931
- Who's the guy?
- You know, that's not funny.

513
00:34:15,518 --> 00:34:17,815
I didn't say it.

514
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:21,255
A lotta people are talking.

515
00:34:44,157 --> 00:34:46,170
Why aren't you in school?

516
00:34:56,517 --> 00:34:58,735
You, huh... doing okay?

517
00:35:00,437 --> 00:35:01,595
Yeah.

518
00:35:01,596 --> 00:35:03,893
It's, huh... Sylvia, right?

519
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:05,730
Yeah.

520
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:08,735
Eric.

521
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:10,955
I, huh... I've
seen you at church.

522
00:35:10,956 --> 00:35:13,048
Yeah, that's me.

523
00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:15,967
You're going to the, huh...
pick-nick, next Saturday?

524
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:19,355
Well, huh... I hope so.

525
00:35:19,356 --> 00:35:20,475
Okay.

526
00:35:20,476 --> 00:35:22,204
Maybe I'll see you there.

527
00:35:26,836 --> 00:35:28,610
Huh... I'm gonna go.

528
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,695
Okay.

529
00:35:33,876 --> 00:35:36,955
Why was Mama so upset
about the other day?

530
00:35:36,956 --> 00:35:38,434
You haven't heard?

531
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:40,674
I told everyone,
that Paula was a slut.

532
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:43,086
That's not true, is it?

533
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:47,654
There's some worse rumors
going around, about her.

534
00:35:50,835 --> 00:35:53,234
Do you think, she's pregnant?

535
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:56,488
- What do you think?
- Yeah, she's real easy.

536
00:36:06,515 --> 00:36:08,334
Thanks.

537
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:11,733
How's your mama?

538
00:36:12,195 --> 00:36:13,969
Okay.

539
00:36:14,315 --> 00:36:16,633
She still in the hospital?

540
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:18,453
Yeah.

541
00:36:23,554 --> 00:36:25,772
Who's taking care of you?

542
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:30,333
I am.

543
00:36:32,554 --> 00:36:35,284
Oh, you don't have a girlfriend?

544
00:36:37,074 --> 00:36:38,633
I don't know.

545
00:36:38,634 --> 00:36:40,833
- You don't know?
- No, I don't.

546
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:43,052
And, huh... does she know?

547
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:48,433
You wanna a sip?

548
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:50,606
I ain't old enough.

549
00:36:52,954 --> 00:36:55,072
You ain't old enough
to smoke, either...

550
00:36:55,073 --> 00:36:57,404
and that's not stopping you.

551
00:37:02,113 --> 00:37:03,966
Jennie?

552
00:37:04,553 --> 00:37:07,487
I think, we should call mom and dad.

553
00:37:07,873 --> 00:37:09,992
How we're supposed to do that?

554
00:37:09,993 --> 00:37:12,961
Here, I found this in the trash.

555
00:37:18,953 --> 00:37:22,525
So, huh... how long's Sylvia
gonna be staying here?

556
00:37:23,113 --> 00:37:25,922
You got a crush on Sylvia?

557
00:37:33,032 --> 00:37:35,250
She is pretty.

558
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:38,751
When I was in high-school...

559
00:37:38,752 --> 00:37:42,767
I was popular with the boys
too then, they all chased me.

560
00:37:44,752 --> 00:37:47,004
I believe you.

561
00:37:47,472 --> 00:37:49,166
Thank you.

562
00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:52,848
Oh, are you warm.

563
00:37:58,752 --> 00:38:01,391
What're you doing home
from school so early?

564
00:38:01,392 --> 00:38:04,201
I'm not feeling real good.

565
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:06,680
Paula?

566
00:38:07,192 --> 00:38:09,249
You better go.

567
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:12,670
Alright, you first.

568
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:13,790
<i>Hello?</i>

569
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,070
<i>- Mama?
- Oh, Honey!</i>

570
00:38:16,071 --> 00:38:17,990
I was afraid, you didn't
get our letter.

571
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:20,150
Oh, mama, we miss you so much.

572
00:38:20,151 --> 00:38:21,790
<i>Oh, I miss you too, Honey.</i>

573
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:23,910
I'm gonna pick you up in 2 weeks.

574
00:38:23,911 --> 00:38:26,367
So, how is everything going there?

575
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:30,390
Oh, Gertrude's awful strict, mama.

576
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,430
<i>We got in a whole
lotta trouble.</i>

577
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:34,150
<i>What do you mean?
Did she punish you?</i>

578
00:38:34,151 --> 00:38:36,130
What's goin' on? These girls
been getting in trouble again?

579
00:38:36,131 --> 00:38:37,750
<i>- Let me talk to'm.
- She got mad...</i>

580
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:39,110
because your check's late.

581
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:40,270
Our check was late?

582
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:41,670
<i>No, it wasn't.</i>

583
00:38:41,671 --> 00:38:43,390
<i>Let me talk to her.</i>

584
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:44,846
Oh, we gotta go.

585
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,309
<i>Sylvia?</i>

586
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,765
<i>Sylvia!</i>

587
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,523
They're coming, mama.

588
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:03,285
Calling your boyfriend, Sylvia?

589
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,789
No.

590
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,669
Nobody special.

591
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,888
We miss our parents.

592
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,809
Thank you, Jennie.

593
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,549
Where'd you get the money to
make a long-distance call?

594
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:18,229
I was picking up empty bottles
at the Park, and traded'm in.

595
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,005
Honest, that's all she did.

596
00:39:35,669 --> 00:39:37,308
What she's gonna do?

597
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:40,118
<i>What she always does, when
she catches you stealin'.</i>

598
00:39:41,029 --> 00:39:43,724
Are you gonna lie to me again?

599
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:46,748
- No, Gertie, I...
- You gonna steal is this household?

600
00:39:46,749 --> 00:39:49,228
I didn't steal from you, Gertie.

601
00:39:49,229 --> 00:39:52,108
What you'd... call your parents,
and warn them, that...

602
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:54,028
Gertie doesn't treat you right?

603
00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:55,803
No, ma'am.

604
00:39:57,029 --> 00:39:58,484
Alright.

605
00:40:00,988 --> 00:40:02,007
I'm sorry!

606
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:03,643
I'm sorry!

607
00:40:10,028 --> 00:40:13,486
Okay, okay, that's a good girl,
that's a good girl.

608
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:20,484
You wanna put some ice on that.

609
00:40:29,108 --> 00:40:32,467
Now, I think you stated, Marie,
that your sister Paula...

610
00:40:32,468 --> 00:40:36,307
you'd volunteered, that Paula
was jealous of Sylvia.

611
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:39,586
Every time she looked at her,
her eyes looked like she hated her.

612
00:40:39,587 --> 00:40:42,442
Do you know, what the
word jealous means?

613
00:40:42,747 --> 00:40:44,946
Angry at someone.

614
00:40:44,947 --> 00:40:46,946
Can you assign a reason...

615
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:51,360
to, why Paula might shoot Sylvia,
those angry, jealous glances?

616
00:40:53,027 --> 00:40:55,366
I guess, because Sylvia thought...

617
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:58,426
she was so much more important,
than Paula was.

618
00:40:58,427 --> 00:41:01,066
Do you remember a time, when you
went to Bethany Baptist church...

619
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:03,923
and had little sandwiches
and something to drink?

620
00:41:08,747 --> 00:41:12,106
I haven't seen you eat
up in a few weeks.

621
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:15,837
Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Orbach,
I've I had to work.

622
00:41:15,866 --> 00:41:18,038
What's with your arm, Paula?

623
00:41:18,826 --> 00:41:21,681
I lost my temper, with Sylvia.

624
00:41:21,986 --> 00:41:24,397
So, what'd you mean,
what happened?

625
00:41:26,586 --> 00:41:29,825
She's been doing some real
terrible things.

626
00:41:29,826 --> 00:41:31,679
I had to be real strict with her.

627
00:41:34,506 --> 00:41:36,724
Come on, its Ok.
It's Ok, come on.

628
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:38,920
Don't take too much.

629
00:41:40,346 --> 00:41:41,985
Hey, what're you doing here?

630
00:41:41,986 --> 00:41:43,705
Came out, for the free food.

631
00:41:43,706 --> 00:41:45,525
And the women.

632
00:41:45,906 --> 00:41:48,465
I hope you don't want
any money, because...

633
00:41:48,466 --> 00:41:51,465
- So, John Senior has...
- I'm not here for money.

634
00:41:51,466 --> 00:41:53,184
Bradley send me.

635
00:41:53,185 --> 00:41:55,118
About Paula.

636
00:41:57,025 --> 00:42:00,323
- Did you say hi to the baby yet?
- Ah-ah.

637
00:42:03,025 --> 00:42:06,304
- Look, about yesterday...
- It's fine, it's fine.

638
00:42:06,305 --> 00:42:07,784
- Sylvia, I'm really...
- It's alright, don't worry about it.

639
00:42:07,785 --> 00:42:10,401
Mama, be back by the
end of this week.

640
00:42:18,305 --> 00:42:19,760
Hey.

641
00:42:20,225 --> 00:42:21,680
Hi.

642
00:42:22,465 --> 00:42:25,354
A couple of my friends, are eating
over there, you wanna join us?

643
00:42:26,025 --> 00:42:28,243
- Sure.
- Okay.

644
00:42:28,945 --> 00:42:30,663
Sylvia!

645
00:42:30,664 --> 00:42:33,280
- Just one second.
- No problem.

646
00:42:35,384 --> 00:42:39,354
Ricky, remember what I said
the other day about Paula?

647
00:42:39,384 --> 00:42:41,363
Did you say something?

648
00:42:41,464 --> 00:42:43,238
No.

649
00:42:43,384 --> 00:42:44,863
Because people are talking...

650
00:42:44,864 --> 00:42:47,023
and Stephanie and
Paula, are blaming me.

651
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:49,719
No, no, I wouldn't do
something like that.

652
00:42:50,744 --> 00:42:52,518
I better go.

653
00:42:57,664 --> 00:43:00,280
I understand she's pregnant?

654
00:43:00,424 --> 00:43:02,183
He says, he's willing to
pay for the abortion.

655
00:43:02,184 --> 00:43:04,463
Be quiet, keep your
voice down, please!

656
00:43:04,464 --> 00:43:08,502
If Paula's willing to go through
with it, anything to keep it quiet.

657
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,197
Here.

658
00:43:13,303 --> 00:43:16,382
There's not gonna be an abortion,
because she's not pregnant.

659
00:43:16,383 --> 00:43:17,782
He didn't even know about it.

660
00:43:17,783 --> 00:43:19,955
But, Sylvia is the one saying it.

661
00:43:20,983 --> 00:43:25,601
That girl's been nothing but trouble
since she came in to my house.

662
00:43:25,863 --> 00:43:29,514
If anyone is pregnant,
she is, I'll bet she is.

663
00:43:33,223 --> 00:43:34,997
I gotta go.

664
00:43:35,703 --> 00:43:37,192
Bye, Kenny.

665
00:43:37,543 --> 00:43:39,362
Bye.

666
00:43:41,463 --> 00:43:43,262
He'll be back, baby.

667
00:43:43,263 --> 00:43:44,831
Hey!

668
00:43:47,462 --> 00:43:50,795
Coming over to hang out
with the grown-ups?

669
00:43:56,422 --> 00:43:58,913
I've got some advice for you.

670
00:43:59,102 --> 00:44:01,781
I wouldn't come between
Gertie and her kids,

671
00:44:01,782 --> 00:44:03,781
She won't like it much.

672
00:44:03,782 --> 00:44:05,317
Alright.

673
00:44:11,302 --> 00:44:12,791
You okay, Gertie?

674
00:44:14,582 --> 00:44:16,913
Yeah, I'm fine.

675
00:44:18,662 --> 00:44:22,392
A bunch of us, gonna cruise the
circle, you wanna come with?

676
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:26,753
Sure, I probably should
ask Gertie first.

677
00:44:27,341 --> 00:44:29,240
You sure?

678
00:44:30,581 --> 00:44:33,072
Come on, let's get outta here!

679
00:44:38,901 --> 00:44:41,420
Looks like Sylvia's going
off with them boys.

680
00:44:41,421 --> 00:44:44,220
You sound surprised,
Ricky Hobbs.

681
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:46,552
You shouldn't be.

682
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:50,153
Let me do that!

683
00:44:52,621 --> 00:44:54,998
You can try, Patty.

684
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:01,189
You sure you can't come,
to the Drive-in with us?

685
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:05,758
No, I'm... I'm late as it is.

686
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,075
Let's go!

687
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,155
Well, I guess, I'll see you
next Sunday then.

688
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,798
Shut that door.

689
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:44,197
I dought, I thought you a lesson.

690
00:45:48,299 --> 00:45:50,938
I don't understand.

691
00:45:50,939 --> 00:45:55,398
Apparently, you've been telling
more lies about my daughter.

692
00:45:57,579 --> 00:45:59,797
I haven't told any lies.

693
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,187
- And then you flirt with, Andy.
- I didn't.

694
00:46:07,419 --> 00:46:09,830
I saw you!

695
00:46:14,618 --> 00:46:19,794
No matter what you want,
you just... you just take it.

696
00:46:20,618 --> 00:46:24,554
No, Gertie, we were just talking.

697
00:46:26,018 --> 00:46:28,156
That's all.

698
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:35,097
Who's in charge here?

699
00:46:35,098 --> 00:46:36,657
You are, mama.

700
00:46:36,658 --> 00:46:38,671
That's right, Baby.

701
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:51,628
Paula, told me about those
boys in California.

702
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:55,987
Ricky, did Sylvia tell you, about
all those boys in California?

703
00:46:57,537 --> 00:46:59,516
No.

704
00:47:01,137 --> 00:47:02,696
Well' if you won't listen to me...

705
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:04,869
maybe I can get you to
listen to your sister.

706
00:47:05,097 --> 00:47:08,296
Keep her from making
those mistakes.

707
00:47:08,297 --> 00:47:09,752
Jennie...

708
00:47:09,857 --> 00:47:12,666
do you wanna be like your sister?

709
00:47:15,297 --> 00:47:16,866
No, ma'am.

710
00:47:18,537 --> 00:47:20,675
That's a good girl.

711
00:47:52,496 --> 00:47:55,135
Patty, then what did
Mrs. Baniszewski do?

712
00:47:55,136 --> 00:47:57,015
She handed her a bottle...

713
00:47:57,016 --> 00:47:59,375
and told her to pull all her skirt.

714
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,195
And then?

715
00:48:01,216 --> 00:48:04,913
And then, she said
to put it up her.

716
00:48:06,815 --> 00:48:10,830
Did Sylvia say anything, when
Mrs. Baniszewski ask her to do this?

717
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,694
All she said was...

718
00:48:13,695 --> 00:48:15,334
I can't.

719
00:48:15,335 --> 00:48:17,414
What did Mrs. Baniszewski say?

720
00:48:17,415 --> 00:48:18,534
She said...

721
00:48:18,535 --> 00:48:20,694
Come on, you can do
better than that!

722
00:48:20,695 --> 00:48:22,833
And what did Sylvia do?

723
00:48:22,975 --> 00:48:25,306
What Gertie told her to.

724
00:48:26,895 --> 00:48:29,067
What the hell is going on?

725
00:48:29,535 --> 00:48:31,454
Somebody, clean up the mess!

726
00:48:31,455 --> 00:48:33,294
Sylvia, get upstairs!

727
00:48:33,295 --> 00:48:35,228
Coy, get her up there!

728
00:48:38,775 --> 00:48:39,894
Wait!

729
00:48:39,895 --> 00:48:42,894
I will not have her in the
same room with my daughter's.

730
00:48:42,895 --> 00:48:44,413
Take her to the basement!

731
00:48:44,414 --> 00:48:46,293
Please, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

732
00:48:46,294 --> 00:48:49,831
- Open the door, Johnny!
- I'm sorry, Gertie! I'm sorry!

733
00:48:50,254 --> 00:48:52,472
Get her outta here!

734
00:48:52,574 --> 00:48:54,893
No! Noooo...

735
00:48:54,894 --> 00:48:57,669
It's best to stay
out of there, I think?

736
00:48:58,094 --> 00:49:01,693
Don't worry, Jennie,
Mama's just teaching her.

737
00:49:01,694 --> 00:49:05,425
- She won't go down.
- I don't care! Just push her!

738
00:50:01,372 --> 00:50:03,191
Hey, Marie!

739
00:50:34,492 --> 00:50:36,310
Sylvia.

740
00:50:37,192 --> 00:50:39,010
Sylvia.

741
00:50:43,811 --> 00:50:46,108
I'm sorry, Sylvia.

742
00:50:47,531 --> 00:50:49,350
But, I'm to scared.

743
00:50:50,251 --> 00:50:53,743
I've tried talking,
with Gertie, but...

744
00:50:57,251 --> 00:51:01,824
She... she said,
you can have your bible.

745
00:51:05,131 --> 00:51:06,825
Jennie.

746
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:09,747
Mama wants you upstairs.

747
00:51:09,771 --> 00:51:11,863
Family-meeting.

748
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,668
I'll do what I can.

749
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:18,869
She said now.

750
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:42,409
Stop hitting me!

751
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,138
Give me that!

752
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:47,425
Johnny, get me my medicine, please.

753
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:52,499
Oh, this area here,
it's not good for my health.

754
00:51:52,929 --> 00:51:54,608
Maybe we can move.

755
00:51:54,609 --> 00:51:56,608
Where would we move to, Shirley?

756
00:51:56,609 --> 00:51:58,288
I don't know.

757
00:51:58,289 --> 00:52:00,347
I don't wanna move.

758
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:08,728
I had a call with
your parents today.

759
00:52:08,729 --> 00:52:10,608
Are they coming for us?

760
00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:12,768
Well, they picked up the
Florida Labor Day circuit...

761
00:52:12,769 --> 00:52:16,147
so, they wont be here for you,
until the end of November, now.

762
00:52:16,889 --> 00:52:19,288
Their checks are coming
in regular, though.

763
00:52:19,289 --> 00:52:21,968
My ironing slowed down...

764
00:52:21,969 --> 00:52:23,568
quite a bit.

765
00:52:23,569 --> 00:52:26,968
So, we all have to work
together, as a family.

766
00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:30,727
Maybe, I can eat over at Coy's
house, mama, if that'll help.

767
00:52:30,728 --> 00:52:31,967
Coy?

768
00:52:31,968 --> 00:52:33,527
Mama, wont mind.

769
00:52:33,528 --> 00:52:35,447
She likes Stephanie a lot.

770
00:52:35,448 --> 00:52:37,267
Thank you.

771
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:41,347
Paula...

772
00:52:41,928 --> 00:52:45,167
Baby, you gonna have to take
up more shift's at work.

773
00:52:45,168 --> 00:52:47,499
Maybe quit Tech for a while.

774
00:52:49,008 --> 00:52:51,464
What about Stephanie?

775
00:52:51,528 --> 00:52:54,407
- Why she have to go to school?
- Because she's smarter than you.

776
00:52:54,408 --> 00:52:56,727
- Shut up, Johnny!
- I'm smarter than you!

777
00:52:56,728 --> 00:52:58,647
- I'm smarter than the both of you!
- Give me my Teddy!

778
00:52:58,648 --> 00:52:59,767
Stop it!

779
00:52:59,768 --> 00:53:01,047
Stop it!

780
00:53:01,048 --> 00:53:02,981
You all, stop it!

781
00:53:05,447 --> 00:53:08,206
That's another thing we have
to work on around here.

782
00:53:08,207 --> 00:53:11,426
We all have to learn
to get along better.

783
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:16,621
How long is Sylvia,
down in the basement?

784
00:53:18,887 --> 00:53:21,901
Until she learns her lesson.

785
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,702
Mama...

786
00:53:28,207 --> 00:53:30,618
She needs to be punished, Paula.

787
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:35,341
Yes, Mama.

788
00:53:37,687 --> 00:53:40,223
Now, if anybody asks...

789
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:44,461
Sylvia... had to go to juvenile.

790
00:53:49,446 --> 00:53:51,379
You got that, Jennie?

791
00:53:57,926 --> 00:53:59,859
Okay.

792
00:54:00,606 --> 00:54:02,380
That's it.

793
00:54:27,245 --> 00:54:29,258
Are you sleeping?

794
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,218
You okay?

795
00:54:40,445 --> 00:54:42,378
Yes.

796
00:54:43,765 --> 00:54:46,335
It's only gonna be for a little while.

797
00:54:57,444 --> 00:55:00,983
Did you ever hear or see, Sylvia,
talk back to any of those people...

798
00:55:00,984 --> 00:55:02,643
when these things were
being done to her?

799
00:55:02,644 --> 00:55:04,163
No, I never.

800
00:55:04,164 --> 00:55:07,123
When it first started did
she say anything then?

801
00:55:07,124 --> 00:55:10,943
No, except she would say,
I'm sorry, or something like that,

802
00:55:10,944 --> 00:55:13,377
as if she did something wrong, but...

803
00:55:13,564 --> 00:55:16,180
she never did anything wrong.

804
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:21,256
Did you yourself, on any of these
occasions, do anything to Sylvia?

805
00:55:21,404 --> 00:55:23,860
I just did what I was told.

806
00:55:26,804 --> 00:55:29,103
Now then, in the month of
September did you see she was an influx

807
00:55:29,104 --> 00:55:31,257
anyone else, do anything to Sylvia?

808
00:56:12,242 --> 00:56:14,539
See, I told you so.

809
00:56:18,202 --> 00:56:19,401
Damn.

810
00:56:19,402 --> 00:56:20,561
What'd she do?

811
00:56:20,562 --> 00:56:21,681
She was real bad.

812
00:56:21,682 --> 00:56:22,801
She's dirty.

813
00:56:22,802 --> 00:56:24,655
Mama said, she was a slut.

814
00:56:27,522 --> 00:56:28,641
Johnny!

815
00:56:28,642 --> 00:56:29,841
Don't worry about it.

816
00:56:29,842 --> 00:56:31,855
She's used to it.

817
00:56:33,122 --> 00:56:35,021
Watch this!

818
00:56:41,402 --> 00:56:42,521
Neat, huh?

819
00:56:42,522 --> 00:56:44,001
You just burn her like that?

820
00:56:44,002 --> 00:56:45,761
Yeah, you can too.

821
00:56:45,762 --> 00:56:47,361
- I don't want to.
- What? You're chicken?.

822
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:48,481
It's OK.

823
00:56:48,482 --> 00:56:50,699
Mama, said you can.

824
00:57:18,801 --> 00:57:23,040
Did you see Sally, take cigarettes,
and actually burn Sylvia with them?

825
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:25,240
- Yes.
- How many times?

826
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:27,571
She would do it, every
time she came over.

827
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,399
How many times did that happened?

828
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,128
Every day.

829
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,959
Did you go to 3850 East New York St...

830
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,079
during the months of
September and October?

831
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,559
Yes, Sir.

832
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,439
We go most days after school.

833
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,599
And did you see Sylvia Likens,
in the basement of that house?

834
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,039
Yes, Sir.

835
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,039
Did you do anything
at all to help her?

836
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,199
No, Sir.

837
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,009
What were the other children,
be doing around the house?

838
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,855
Playing around.

839
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,219
Did you ever tell some of the other
kids that they should come over...

840
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,119
to the house, because everyone
was having fun with Sylvia?

841
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,479
I just thought,
we were punishing her.

842
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,097
Where was John standing,
when he was washing her down.

843
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:05,238
Right in front of her.

844
00:58:05,239 --> 00:58:07,118
What part of her body
was he spraying?

845
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,318
- All over.
- Who's hose was he using?

846
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,078
It was my hose, Sir.

847
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:14,318
Sally, did you ever see some of the
other neighborhood kids, hurt Sylvia?

848
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:15,774
Yes.

849
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:19,733
Did you tell anybody,
you saw anything?

850
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:22,297
Not really.

851
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:27,128
So, you told no one, what was happening
at the Baniszewski's house?

852
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,478
Well, I told my father...

853
00:58:29,479 --> 00:58:32,438
Gertrude gave Sylvia,
an awful whipping.

854
00:58:32,439 --> 00:58:34,878
But, he just told me, I shouldn't
do whatever she did...

855
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:37,449
or I get the same.

856
00:58:38,399 --> 00:58:40,118
Shirley, was your mother
ever present...

857
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:42,557
while some of the other people
were doing these things, to Sylvia?

858
00:58:42,558 --> 00:58:44,237
Yes, she was.

859
00:58:44,238 --> 00:58:46,137
How many times?

860
00:58:46,758 --> 00:58:48,997
She was there, just
about all the time.

861
00:58:48,998 --> 00:58:53,047
And what did she say when people
were doing these things, to Sylvia?

862
00:58:53,878 --> 00:58:55,333
Nothing.

863
00:59:01,398 --> 00:59:04,287
Did anyone order you, to hit Sylvia?

864
00:59:04,718 --> 00:59:06,237
No, Sir.

865
00:59:06,238 --> 00:59:08,837
- Or, tie her up?
- No, Sir.

866
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:10,637
- Or, wash her down?
- No, Sir.

867
00:59:10,638 --> 00:59:12,617
Then, why did you do it, Teddy?

868
00:59:13,318 --> 00:59:15,012
I don't no, Sir.

869
00:59:15,198 --> 00:59:17,097
I don't no, Sir.

870
00:59:17,318 --> 00:59:19,296
I don't no, Sir.

871
00:59:26,557 --> 00:59:28,396
You two, go upstairs.

872
00:59:28,397 --> 00:59:30,091
Yes, Mama.

873
00:59:49,557 --> 00:59:52,810
Paula Baniszewski.
Pregnancy test, Urinalysis.

874
01:00:00,316 --> 01:00:02,215
Who is it?

875
01:00:04,116 --> 01:00:06,129
You got any cigarettes?

876
01:00:24,116 --> 01:00:26,766
Hear anything from Sylvia?

877
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:31,332
You really like her, don't you?

878
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:34,970
She's not good for you, Honey.

879
01:00:37,075 --> 01:00:39,531
You know, when she's gonna be back?

880
01:00:41,195 --> 01:00:46,086
Ricky, I told you, she wont
have anything to do with you.

881
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:49,244
She's to busy with other boys.

882
01:00:50,075 --> 01:00:53,135
That's why I had to
send her to juve.

883
01:00:54,355 --> 01:00:55,890
Hand me that!

884
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:01,208
- Get!
- Alright, I'll go.

885
01:01:07,155 --> 01:01:08,690
Here's your money.

886
01:01:08,955 --> 01:01:10,834
Thank you, baby.

887
01:01:10,835 --> 01:01:12,289
Paula...

888
01:01:13,714 --> 01:01:18,002
Honey! You are a good daughter,
I'm so proud of you.

889
01:01:18,794 --> 01:01:23,128
It don't matter what people say,
you'd be holdin' your head up high.

890
01:01:24,154 --> 01:01:26,451
We're gettin' through this.

891
01:01:27,754 --> 01:01:30,165
What about Sylvia?

892
01:01:34,154 --> 01:01:36,053
Look...

893
01:01:36,314 --> 01:01:38,566
I've been praying...

894
01:01:39,554 --> 01:01:41,593
and I think, maybe it's time
to forgive her.

895
01:01:41,594 --> 01:01:44,289
I think, she's learned her lesson.

896
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:47,673
Their are things in life,
we have to do...

897
01:01:47,674 --> 01:01:50,050
whate'er we like it or not.

898
01:01:51,353 --> 01:01:54,447
Well, I don't want any part of it.

899
01:01:55,873 --> 01:01:57,601
Paula.

900
01:01:59,033 --> 01:02:00,952
Paula?

901
01:02:00,953 --> 01:02:04,047
Come down here and talk to me!

902
01:02:27,352 --> 01:02:30,650
Hey, Sylvia? I'm not
gonna hurt you, okay?

903
01:02:30,672 --> 01:02:33,083
I'm not gonna hurt you.

904
01:02:46,752 --> 01:02:50,210
I know what it's like
to be sick, Sylvia.

905
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:05,171
I've been sick for so long, too.

906
01:03:07,231 --> 01:03:09,483
I can't...

907
01:03:09,591 --> 01:03:13,242
discipline my kids,
the way that I should.

908
01:03:16,431 --> 01:03:19,604
I'm punishing you I known, but...

909
01:03:19,711 --> 01:03:21,590
sometimes, when I take medicine...

910
01:03:21,591 --> 01:03:24,525
it's like, if I don't
know what I'm doing.

911
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:33,445
And I care for you, so much.

912
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,726
With Paula, the thing is...

913
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:47,045
Paula is a lot like me.

914
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:53,245
I had her, when I was,
just about your age.

915
01:03:58,070 --> 01:04:01,721
And then along came, Stephanie...

916
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,160
and then all the others.

917
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:10,769
And...

918
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:13,719
then John left.

919
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:23,804
And here I am, just huh...

920
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:30,080
doing everything I can,
to keep my Family together.

921
01:04:31,549 --> 01:04:34,688
I want something better for Paula.

922
01:04:39,229 --> 01:04:41,924
There has to be something better.

923
01:04:54,069 --> 01:04:57,605
And I need to protect my children.

924
01:05:00,628 --> 01:05:03,358
Do you understand that?

925
01:05:03,948 --> 01:05:06,040
These kids...

926
01:05:06,668 --> 01:05:09,079
they're all I've got.

927
01:05:27,588 --> 01:05:29,441
Thank you, Sylvia.

928
01:05:33,147 --> 01:05:34,666
Thank you.

929
01:05:34,667 --> 01:05:37,546
Thank you, for understanding, okay?

930
01:05:37,547 --> 01:05:39,026
Thank you.

931
01:05:50,907 --> 01:05:52,007
Oh, lord.

932
01:05:52,507 --> 01:05:54,235
Okay.

933
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:00,120
Hello, Reverend.

934
01:06:03,787 --> 01:06:05,266
I've been meaning to
come by and visit...

935
01:06:05,267 --> 01:06:07,626
but, when Paula came to the
church and talk to me...

936
01:06:07,627 --> 01:06:09,426
it just pushed me a little.

937
01:06:09,427 --> 01:06:12,759
Now, what's that girl
been bothering you with?

938
01:06:15,066 --> 01:06:18,785
Well, she's concerned about you
and the whole house.

939
01:06:18,786 --> 01:06:22,745
And, huh... there's something else.

940
01:06:22,946 --> 01:06:25,562
I think, Paula may be pregnant.

941
01:06:25,706 --> 01:06:28,685
Now, I'm prepared to offer
what support I can...

942
01:06:28,686 --> 01:06:30,665
but, I can't speak for
the entire congregation.

943
01:06:30,666 --> 01:06:32,265
Reverend, I'm sorry, thank you...

944
01:06:32,266 --> 01:06:36,425
but, it's a vicious lie and rumor...

945
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:38,345
spread by that Likens' girl.

946
01:06:38,346 --> 01:06:39,465
Gertrude...

947
01:06:39,466 --> 01:06:41,305
Paula, talked to me herself.

948
01:06:41,306 --> 01:06:42,705
Well, Reverend,
I don't understand that.

949
01:06:42,706 --> 01:06:44,465
I'll try to get to the bottom
of that with Paula...

950
01:06:44,466 --> 01:06:47,944
but Sylvia has been a very bad
influence on her...

951
01:06:47,945 --> 01:06:50,024
since she came in to my house.

952
01:06:50,025 --> 01:06:51,784
And I have...

953
01:06:51,785 --> 01:06:54,224
I just can not
discipline that girl.

954
01:06:54,225 --> 01:06:56,624
<i>Well, she did mention,
Sylvia is around...</i>

955
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:58,944
but wasn't clear, she said
there were some problems...

956
01:06:58,945 --> 01:07:01,384
and I haven't seen Sylvia,
in church in weeks...

957
01:07:01,385 --> 01:07:04,080
so I thought, I just should
sit down and talk with her.

958
01:07:04,265 --> 01:07:07,199
I'm afraid, I had to
send her to juvenile.

959
01:07:07,425 --> 01:07:10,704
I just could not handle that girl.

960
01:07:10,705 --> 01:07:12,264
I caught her stealing from me...

961
01:07:12,265 --> 01:07:13,664
Have you spoken with
her parents about this?

962
01:07:13,665 --> 01:07:16,024
I tried, I, huh... I wrote
them, I've called...

963
01:07:16,025 --> 01:07:18,344
I haven't gotten a responds.

964
01:07:18,345 --> 01:07:19,984
Honestly, now I can understand...

965
01:07:19,985 --> 01:07:22,024
why they just dropped
her with me.

966
01:07:22,025 --> 01:07:23,344
I see.

967
01:07:23,345 --> 01:07:24,943
I just can go by the
juvenile center...

968
01:07:24,944 --> 01:07:27,023
and speak to Sylvia myself.

969
01:07:27,024 --> 01:07:28,903
I'll try to arrange that.

970
01:07:28,904 --> 01:07:31,023
- Hi, uncle Bill.
- Hello, Reverend.

971
01:07:31,024 --> 01:07:32,923
Hey, kids.

972
01:07:32,984 --> 01:07:35,783
Why don't you take
little Kenny, please!

973
01:07:35,784 --> 01:07:38,063
We can continue this
discussion later.

974
01:07:38,064 --> 01:07:40,077
Thank you, Reverend.

975
01:07:44,864 --> 01:07:47,183
I'll see you on Sunday then.

976
01:07:47,184 --> 01:07:50,103
<i>I'm excepting you in my
office before the end of the week.</i>

977
01:07:50,104 --> 01:07:52,401
We need to talk about this.

978
01:07:52,624 --> 01:07:54,023
Sure, Reverend.

979
01:07:54,024 --> 01:07:55,877
Okay, Gertrude.

980
01:08:04,983 --> 01:08:07,075
Don't you have any sense?

981
01:08:09,423 --> 01:08:12,835
- I'm doing this for you!
- Let go off me!

982
01:08:19,423 --> 01:08:22,198
I want everybody in the basement!

983
01:08:27,783 --> 01:08:29,382
You know why you're here.

984
01:08:29,383 --> 01:08:31,202
Sylvia!

985
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:41,391
Ricky, she came back.

986
01:08:41,622 --> 01:08:44,181
She came back from juvenile...

987
01:08:44,182 --> 01:08:46,513
then she started trouble again.

988
01:08:46,582 --> 01:08:48,037
Stop it!

989
01:08:49,902 --> 01:08:51,261
Johnny, hold her!

990
01:08:51,262 --> 01:08:52,741
No, please! Please!

991
01:08:52,742 --> 01:08:54,221
Hold her still!

992
01:08:54,222 --> 01:08:56,519
Sylvia, if you keep moving,
it'll only be messy.

993
01:08:57,262 --> 01:08:58,861
Light that!

994
01:08:58,862 --> 01:09:01,956
No! No! No!

995
01:09:01,957 --> 01:09:03,956
No! No! No!

996
01:09:04,262 --> 01:09:06,593
Please! Please! Please!

997
01:09:06,662 --> 01:09:08,541
- Stop it!
- Is this alright, Mama?

998
01:09:08,542 --> 01:09:10,919
Make sure it's hot.

999
01:09:12,182 --> 01:09:14,381
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- You Liar!

1000
01:09:14,382 --> 01:09:16,515
- No! No!
- Hey!

1001
01:09:16,622 --> 01:09:19,316
Please no! Please!

1002
01:09:21,021 --> 01:09:23,830
You branded my daughter.

1003
01:09:24,741 --> 01:09:27,516
Now, I'm gonna brand you.

1004
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:37,149
Ricky!

1005
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:40,111
Come here! Finish it!

1006
01:09:42,021 --> 01:09:43,874
Gertie, I can't.

1007
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:49,540
Ricky, she was with every boy,
but you.

1008
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:51,793
You can't let her
get away with this.

1009
01:09:54,181 --> 01:09:56,219
Please, help me, Ricky.

1010
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:58,039
Please! Please!

1011
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:00,193
Good boy.

1012
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:03,193
Ricky!

1013
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:08,634
What does it say?

1014
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,870
It says: "I'm a Prostitute...

1015
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:14,389
and proud of it".

1016
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:22,191
NO! NO! Stop it! NO!

1017
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:37,832
Sylvia.

1018
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:41,836
You've gotta get outta here.

1019
01:10:42,259 --> 01:10:44,018
You gotta leave.

1020
01:10:44,019 --> 01:10:46,157
You gotta get away
from here, come!

1021
01:10:52,859 --> 01:10:55,077
Oh, I can't...

1022
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:01,877
Shh...

1023
01:12:00,657 --> 01:12:02,112
Mama?

1024
01:12:04,177 --> 01:12:06,296
- You gotta get outta here!
- I don't no where to go.

1025
01:12:06,297 --> 01:12:08,016
You go find your parents.

1026
01:12:08,017 --> 01:12:09,136
And Jennie?

1027
01:12:09,137 --> 01:12:10,856
Jennie can take care of herself,
don't worry about her.

1028
01:12:10,857 --> 01:12:12,312
Paula?

1029
01:12:12,617 --> 01:12:13,896
No! No!

1030
01:12:13,897 --> 01:12:15,616
Go! Just go!

1031
01:12:15,617 --> 01:12:17,345
What're doing?

1032
01:12:17,497 --> 01:12:19,794
- Just let me go!
- Mama, stop!

1033
01:12:19,797 --> 01:12:21,936
- Stop it!
- What's going on?

1034
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:24,189
Let's go in the house.

1035
01:12:38,376 --> 01:12:39,991
Sylvia!

1036
01:12:40,256 --> 01:12:43,095
Please, please don't hurt me!

1037
01:12:43,096 --> 01:12:44,775
No, no, no, no,
I'm not gonna hurt.

1038
01:12:44,776 --> 01:12:46,655
I swear to God.
I promise, I promise.

1039
01:12:46,656 --> 01:12:47,855
Look, I'm sorry.

1040
01:12:47,856 --> 01:12:49,855
I didn't know, what the hell
I was doing, alright?

1041
01:12:49,856 --> 01:12:51,935
But, you gotta believe me, please!

1042
01:12:51,936 --> 01:12:53,585
Please!

1043
01:12:54,216 --> 01:12:55,535
You wanna get outta here?

1044
01:12:55,536 --> 01:12:57,495
You wanna go? Let's go.

1045
01:12:57,496 --> 01:12:58,815
Come on.

1046
01:12:58,816 --> 01:13:00,715
Come on now, you're alright.

1047
01:13:05,295 --> 01:13:06,934
Where're we going?

1048
01:13:06,935 --> 01:13:08,709
I don't know.

1049
01:13:09,215 --> 01:13:12,513
Police? You wanna go to the Police?
We can tell'm everything.

1050
01:13:12,615 --> 01:13:14,294
I just wanna go to my mom.

1051
01:13:14,295 --> 01:13:15,989
Where's your mama?

1052
01:13:16,455 --> 01:13:18,614
I think, she's in Portage.

1053
01:13:18,615 --> 01:13:20,707
We're going to Portage.

1054
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,630
Damn it!

1055
01:13:30,575 --> 01:13:32,584
- Ricky?
- Oh my God!

1056
01:13:32,585 --> 01:13:34,384
We're going! We're going!

1057
01:13:57,654 --> 01:13:59,587
I'll come with you.

1058
01:13:59,974 --> 01:14:02,271
No, you gotta get back.

1059
01:14:04,814 --> 01:14:08,829
You gotta get back to Jennie, and
make sure nothing happens to her.

1060
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:13,984
I wont let her out of my site.

1061
01:14:15,174 --> 01:14:17,072
Thank you, Ricky.

1062
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:00,867
Daddy?

1063
01:15:02,692 --> 01:15:04,466
Cookie?

1064
01:15:04,692 --> 01:15:06,091
What're you doing here?

1065
01:15:06,092 --> 01:15:07,741
Dad!

1066
01:15:08,132 --> 01:15:11,066
Oh, my...
What happened to you?

1067
01:15:20,092 --> 01:15:22,071
Oh, my God.

1068
01:15:23,092 --> 01:15:25,025
Oh, my God.

1069
01:15:29,212 --> 01:15:31,224
They did this to you?

1070
01:15:34,691 --> 01:15:37,227
I'm so... so sorry.

1071
01:15:37,611 --> 01:15:40,090
I'm just so sorry,
I left you there.

1072
01:15:40,091 --> 01:15:41,690
We spoke to Jennie,
on the phone last week.

1073
01:15:41,691 --> 01:15:43,290
She said everything was fine.

1074
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:45,702
She's scared of her.

1075
01:15:45,931 --> 01:15:47,830
We gotta go back.

1076
01:15:50,411 --> 01:15:52,708
Let's just talk in the car.

1077
01:15:52,851 --> 01:15:55,865
Everything’s gonna be
taking care of, Cookie.

1078
01:15:56,011 --> 01:15:58,183
You're with your family now.

1079
01:15:58,571 --> 01:16:02,268
Oh, Honey.
Mama's here now.

1080
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:11,068
Hey, Honey! We're here.

1081
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:26,209
You stay here, Cookie.

1082
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:28,143
No, huh...

1083
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:32,466
I gotta do this.

1084
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,542
I'm just gonna go in.

1085
01:17:06,769 --> 01:17:09,208
She's not breathing, mama.

1086
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:12,128
She'll wake up, okay?
Don't worry, son.

1087
01:17:12,129 --> 01:17:14,108
Wake up, please!

1088
01:17:14,249 --> 01:17:15,528
Stephanie?

1089
01:17:15,529 --> 01:17:17,888
- She's not breathing!
- She's faking it.

1090
01:17:17,889 --> 01:17:20,528
Somebody, please do something!
Because she's not breathing!

1091
01:17:20,529 --> 01:17:23,007
- She's faking it.
- Johnny, bring that water?

1092
01:17:23,008 --> 01:17:25,487
- Bring me some water, baby.
- Give me it!

1093
01:17:25,488 --> 01:17:26,687
She okay?

1094
01:17:26,688 --> 01:17:28,367
Please, somebody,
she's not breathing!

1095
01:17:28,368 --> 01:17:31,087
Liar, liar, liar, liar...

1096
01:17:31,088 --> 01:17:32,967
Mama, she's not faking it!

1097
01:17:32,968 --> 01:17:35,847
She came to my house,
and just told lies.

1098
01:17:35,848 --> 01:17:37,767
Stephanie, what's wrong?

1099
01:17:37,768 --> 01:17:39,527
Mama, we gotta do something!

1100
01:17:39,528 --> 01:17:42,383
Sweetie, mama, she's...

1101
01:17:43,008 --> 01:17:45,207
Please, Sylvia, please breath.

1102
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:47,187
Sylvia?

1103
01:17:51,768 --> 01:17:54,087
Shirley, she'll be okay,
she'll be okay.

1104
01:17:54,088 --> 01:17:56,487
Somebody's gotta do something!
She's not breathing!

1105
01:17:56,488 --> 01:17:59,627
Shut up, Stephanie! She's lyin'!

1106
01:17:59,928 --> 01:18:01,926
She just lays there.

1107
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,166
Oh, my god.

1108
01:18:03,167 --> 01:18:05,020
Ricky, do something!

1109
01:18:05,367 --> 01:18:06,982
Look out!

1110
01:18:07,287 --> 01:18:09,166
Here, try this.

1111
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:10,806
Sylvia! Wake up!

1112
01:18:10,807 --> 01:18:12,166
- Come on, breath!
- Paula...

1113
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:15,126
you go get Andy, baby,
he'll know what to do, okay?

1114
01:18:15,127 --> 01:18:16,766
Wake up, Sylvia!

1115
01:18:16,767 --> 01:18:18,686
She'll be okay,
she's just faking it.

1116
01:18:18,687 --> 01:18:20,246
Please, Sylvia, breath.

1117
01:18:20,247 --> 01:18:21,726
She's cold.

1118
01:18:21,727 --> 01:18:23,366
Somebody better call the police!

1119
01:18:23,367 --> 01:18:25,206
Don't call the police.

1120
01:18:25,207 --> 01:18:26,981
Just go!

1121
01:18:27,967 --> 01:18:30,166
She's not dying!

1122
01:18:30,167 --> 01:18:31,926
I'll go get more water,
colder this time!

1123
01:18:31,927 --> 01:18:34,543
Babies', come here...

1124
01:18:36,767 --> 01:18:38,925
She's lying, baby, She's just...

1125
01:18:38,926 --> 01:18:41,496
Mama, she's not faking it!

1126
01:18:50,206 --> 01:18:51,645
I need the police!

1127
01:18:51,646 --> 01:18:54,216
<i>Yeah, there maybe a
death girl in a house.</i>

1128
01:19:02,006 --> 01:19:03,575
She's dead.

1129
01:19:03,806 --> 01:19:05,705
Jesus Christ, Gertie.

1130
01:19:14,726 --> 01:19:16,404
What's the problem?

1131
01:19:16,405 --> 01:19:19,339
Get me out of here,
I'll tell you everything.

1132
01:19:23,965 --> 01:19:26,204
Jennie, did you ever see...

1133
01:19:26,205 --> 01:19:29,344
Sylvia do anything,
to Mrs. Baniszewski?

1134
01:19:30,805 --> 01:19:34,058
No. I didn't see anything.

1135
01:19:34,605 --> 01:19:37,524
Did you ever see her
do anything, to Paula?

1136
01:19:37,525 --> 01:19:39,378
No.

1137
01:19:39,965 --> 01:19:43,004
Did you ever see her do anything,
to Johnny Baniszewski?

1138
01:19:43,005 --> 01:19:44,824
No.

1139
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:52,575
Jennie, you saw your
sister being hit...

1140
01:19:53,164 --> 01:19:55,163
beaten, struck.

1141
01:19:55,164 --> 01:19:58,132
Why did you not call the police?

1142
01:19:58,244 --> 01:20:02,283
Well, huh... Gertie dreaded me,
that if I told anybody...

1143
01:20:02,284 --> 01:20:04,854
I'd get the same treatment,
than Sylvia was getting.

1144
01:20:05,644 --> 01:20:08,658
You could have told anyone,
up and down on the street.

1145
01:20:09,124 --> 01:20:13,378
I was scared, and I guess,
I just...

1146
01:20:13,604 --> 01:20:17,494
did what she told me to do.
I wish, I hadn't.

1147
01:20:22,084 --> 01:20:24,495
Did you ever see Sylvia cry?

1148
01:20:31,003 --> 01:20:33,682
They said, she didn't
have any feelings...

1149
01:20:33,683 --> 01:20:36,333
but... I knew better.

1150
01:20:37,923 --> 01:20:41,256
I've seen her cry before.

1151
01:20:42,043 --> 01:20:46,322
I imagine, the reason
that she didn't cry, was...

1152
01:20:46,323 --> 01:20:49,576
because she didn't
have enough water.

1153
01:20:51,723 --> 01:20:54,691
<i>The trial lasted 24 days.</i>

1154
01:20:54,763 --> 01:20:57,842
Gertrude was the last
one to take the stand.

1155
01:20:57,843 --> 01:21:03,258
What was your physical condition
in July and August of last year?

1156
01:21:05,563 --> 01:21:08,098
Pretty run down, physically.

1157
01:21:08,642 --> 01:21:11,041
Pretty upset, mentally and emotionally.

1158
01:21:11,042 --> 01:21:13,055
What do you mean?

1159
01:21:14,042 --> 01:21:17,694
If you got as many children...

1160
01:21:17,882 --> 01:21:22,201
around your home,
all the time, as I do...

1161
01:21:22,202 --> 01:21:24,361
arguing and carrying on...

1162
01:21:24,362 --> 01:21:27,641
you'd be pretty upset,
mentally and emotionally too.

1163
01:21:27,642 --> 01:21:29,801
What medicine did you take?

1164
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:33,441
Phenobarbital Sulfate,
and Coricidin.

1165
01:21:33,442 --> 01:21:36,281
I was trying to take
care of myself...

1166
01:21:36,282 --> 01:21:39,342
because I could not
afford to go to a doctor.

1167
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:43,761
<i>Well, then, getting to
the 1st, week of September.</i>

1168
01:21:43,762 --> 01:21:46,760
Was there any change in your
physical condition...

1169
01:21:46,761 --> 01:21:49,092
or in the condition of that house?

1170
01:21:52,401 --> 01:21:54,254
No, Sir.

1171
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:56,160
<i>What about the 3rd. week
of September...</i>

1172
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:57,600
do you remember that?

1173
01:21:57,601 --> 01:22:00,520
You mean anything specific that
might happened in September?

1174
01:22:00,521 --> 01:22:02,760
Yes, anything specific.

1175
01:22:02,761 --> 01:22:04,640
The kids were fighting a lot.

1176
01:22:04,641 --> 01:22:07,211
The kids were fighting a lot?

1177
01:22:07,601 --> 01:22:10,400
My children and the
neighbor children...

1178
01:22:10,401 --> 01:22:13,000
were coming in,
and fight things over it.

1179
01:22:13,001 --> 01:22:17,480
My children fighting with other
children, so on and so fort.

1180
01:22:17,481 --> 01:22:20,017
What did you do,
when that was happening?

1181
01:22:21,681 --> 01:22:24,694
I did not see this, fighting then.

1182
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,959
I was barely able to stay up at all.

1183
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:31,338
I did not even feel
like getting up.

1184
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,779
Did you have any knowledge,
of any mistreatment...

1185
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:36,698
going on with Sylvia?

1186
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:40,319
No, Sir.

1187
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:45,211
Did you commit any indignity,
making marks on that girls body?

1188
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,079
No, Sir.

1189
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,775
Do you know, how those
wounds, got on her body?

1190
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,399
No, Sir.

1191
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,539
You're telling the Jury,
you don't know who did it?

1192
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,492
No.

1193
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:03,530
Did you hear the testimony of Jennie?

1194
01:23:03,959 --> 01:23:05,598
Yes, I did.

1195
01:23:05,599 --> 01:23:07,998
Did you hear, some of
your children state...

1196
01:23:07,999 --> 01:23:11,775
that before Sylvia died,
you started branding this girl?

1197
01:23:13,879 --> 01:23:15,573
Yes, I heard that.

1198
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:17,498
Did they all lie?

1199
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:26,158
That is right.

1200
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:29,298
The fact is you're lying, isn't it?

1201
01:23:29,799 --> 01:23:32,051
No, Sir.

1202
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:37,037
Did you hear John Baniszewski state...

1203
01:23:37,038 --> 01:23:41,213
that you burned her,
with matches and cigarettes?

1204
01:23:42,758 --> 01:23:44,757
Yes, I heard that statement.

1205
01:23:44,758 --> 01:23:47,135
Did he tell the truth?

1206
01:23:51,398 --> 01:23:54,037
He was not telling the truth.

1207
01:23:54,038 --> 01:23:56,096
No.

1208
01:23:57,958 --> 01:24:00,688
You're saying, you did not do it?

1209
01:24:01,598 --> 01:24:02,957
That's right.

1210
01:24:02,958 --> 01:24:04,597
You were in bed,
a great deal of the time...

1211
01:24:04,598 --> 01:24:07,397
when the children were doing things,
you did not know, they were doing.

1212
01:24:07,398 --> 01:24:09,957
I imagine they were doing
a great deal of things...

1213
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:11,277
that I did not know.

1214
01:24:11,278 --> 01:24:13,416
Why did Johnny lie?

1215
01:24:15,197 --> 01:24:18,236
I imagine, he is a pretty
scared little boy.

1216
01:24:18,237 --> 01:24:19,965
Are you scared?

1217
01:24:22,037 --> 01:24:26,086
I've been scared by a lot
of things, for a long time.

1218
01:24:26,877 --> 01:24:30,276
She sacrificed me,
to protect her children...

1219
01:24:30,277 --> 01:24:33,735
and sacrificed them,
to protect herself.

1220
01:24:54,796 --> 01:24:57,048
Will the accused, please rise!

1221
01:25:08,916 --> 01:25:12,115
We, the Jury, find
Gertrude Baniszewski...

1222
01:25:12,116 --> 01:25:14,275
guilty of 1st. degree murder...

1223
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:16,971
sentencing her to life in prison.

1224
01:25:25,676 --> 01:25:28,053
The case got a lot of attention...

1225
01:25:29,355 --> 01:25:32,050
it even made Time Magazine.

1226
01:25:37,555 --> 01:25:39,074
And most people started talking...

1227
01:25:39,075 --> 01:25:41,770
about things, they used to ignore.

1228
01:25:42,955 --> 01:25:44,154
Thank you.

1229
01:25:44,155 --> 01:25:46,434
The others, were tried later.

1230
01:25:46,435 --> 01:25:48,394
Paula was found guilty
as an accomplice...

1231
01:25:48,395 --> 01:25:50,474
and served a couple of years.

1232
01:25:50,475 --> 01:25:53,967
She had that Baby,
and named it, Gertrude.

1233
01:25:54,155 --> 01:25:56,434
Johnny was convicted too.

1234
01:25:56,435 --> 01:25:57,874
He was the youngest inmate...

1235
01:25:57,875 --> 01:26:00,954
in the history, of the
Indiana State Reformatory.

1236
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:03,354
He would later become
a real Minister.

1237
01:26:03,355 --> 01:26:05,447
one way of telling
the story, I guess.

1238
01:26:05,795 --> 01:26:08,193
Ricky Hobbs, was found
guilty of man-slaughter...

1239
01:26:08,194 --> 01:26:11,313
he served time at the reformatory.

1240
01:26:11,314 --> 01:26:15,409
<i>He died at age 21,
of lung cancer.</i>

1241
01:26:16,314 --> 01:26:19,009
Coy, also served a couple of years...

1242
01:26:19,154 --> 01:26:20,913
He went on with a life of crime...

1243
01:26:20,914 --> 01:26:23,450
after he got released from prison.

1244
01:26:23,794 --> 01:26:27,127
I don't know, what happened,
to any of the rest of them.

1245
01:26:27,874 --> 01:26:29,753
Mom und Dad, went back on Tour...

1246
01:26:29,754 --> 01:26:33,113
<i>and left Jennie, with the
District Attorney and his Family.</i>

1247
01:26:33,114 --> 01:26:35,570
They helped her get back on her feet.

1248
01:26:38,394 --> 01:26:41,673
<i>Gertrude served 20 years
of her life sentence.</i>

1249
01:26:41,674 --> 01:26:45,290
She was released on parole in 1985.

1250
01:26:46,033 --> 01:26:49,072
Before she died 5 years later...

1251
01:26:49,073 --> 01:26:52,770
she took responsibility, for
everything that had happened.

1252
01:27:06,353 --> 01:27:08,525
I'm so sorry.

1253
01:27:18,793 --> 01:27:20,646
And me?

1254
01:27:22,152 --> 01:27:25,007
I returned to the carnival.

1255
01:27:25,432 --> 01:27:28,400
The only place, I always felt save.

1256
01:27:31,232 --> 01:27:33,711
Reverend Bill, used to say:

1257
01:27:33,712 --> 01:27:37,443
"For every situation,
God always has a plan".

1258
01:27:39,632 --> 01:27:43,920
I guess, I'm still trying
to figure out, what that plan was.
