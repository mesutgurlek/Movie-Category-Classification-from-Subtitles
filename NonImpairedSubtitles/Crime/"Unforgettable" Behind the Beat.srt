Students, friends,
everybody was dropping by

333

all the time to jam.

334
00:12:35,196 --> 00:12:37,629
Well, my place is the same today.

335
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,132
Anyone who came back could have taken it.

336
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:42,301
I don't remember you
having a gun back then.

337
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:46,255
I also don't remember you
beating the shit out of people.

338

Sure.

345
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:34,236
I saw that exact logo on a matchbook

346
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:36,004
in Davis's dorm room.

347

- I don't know.
- Thank you.

352
00:13:42,963 --> 00:13:45,931
- He was talking to me.
- [chuckles] I was.

353
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,199
He's stonewalling.

Ah, well, I got something.

355
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,470
Leo's napkin's from the
hidden, underground club

356
00:13:51,555 --> 00:13:52,971
in the Bronx called The Drunken Rabbit.

357
00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:57,342
Owned by... Marco Vrioni.

358
00:13:57,444 --> 00:13:58,644
Vrioni? I know this guy

359
00:13:58,746 --> 00:13:59,978
from back in my organized crime days.

360
00:14:00,114 --> 00:14:01,613
He's got ties to the Albanian mafia.

361
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,714
Well, it looks like Vrioni is involved in

362
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,466
multiple enterprises.

363
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,618
Nightclubs, racketeering, drug trafficking,

364
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:08,504
and he's also big-time into race horses.

365
00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:09,955
Ooh.

366
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,356
Owns a box over at the Aqueduct.

367
00:14:15,763 --> 00:14:18,297
Start talking about The Drunken Rabbit.

368
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:19,915
What was Davis doing in a club

369
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,350
run by an Albanian gangster?

370
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:22,784
I don't know.

371
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,086
We know Davis is connected to it

372
00:14:24,205 --> 00:14:26,738

I got Davis to play gigs there.

376
00:14:33,714 --> 00:14:36,815
Playing for a nightlife crowd
is an invaluable experience

377
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,250
for a young musician like Davis.

378
00:14:38,352 --> 00:14:40,168
There are plenty of jazz clubs in New York.

379
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,455
Why push Davis to play
for a bunch of thugs?

380
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:45,457
They paid the best.

381
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,492
You were taking a cut, weren't you?

382
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,965
How much?

383
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,967
70%.

384
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:02,040
What happened to you?

385
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:04,209
Alimony payments from two divorces.

386
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:06,144
Well, they don't pay themselves.

387
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:08,063
And offers for gigs of my own,

388
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:09,982
well, they've been drying
up for the past few years.

389
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,535
My life didn't turn out
exactly the way I'd planned it.

390
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:16,388
So, what? Davis finally refused to play.

391
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:18,023
Maybe he threatened to expose you

392
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,608
- and you shot him?
- I didn't shoot him.

393
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:21,326
- Then you tell me who did.
- I don't know.

A jury is gonna look at

you were taking from him

398
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:38,694
and they will draw their own conclusion.

399

Leo, you gotta give me something

Uh...

403
00:15:49,723 --> 00:15:52,341
Davis played a midnight set

404
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:55,427
at The Drunken Rabbit the night he died.

405
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,497
Was Davis having problems
with anyone at that club?

406
00:15:58,599 --> 00:15:59,865
I don't know.

407

out where he was going.

00:26:59,296 --> 00:27:00,328
You're wearing your friend's necklace?

661
00:27:00,431 --> 00:27:02,197
He means girlfriend.

662
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:04,666
I mean, it's not that defined... yet.

663
00:27:04,768 --> 00:27:06,535
Eh, defined enough that
you're wearing her necklace.

664
00:27:06,637 --> 00:27:08,136
She asked me to wear it, okay?

665
00:27:08,238 --> 00:27:09,871
Something about, you know,
making us feel closer.

666
00:27:09,973 --> 00:27:11,373
Something like that.

667
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:13,391
Aww, that's sweet.

668
00:27:13,477 --> 00:27:15,477
Al, you could take a leaf out of his book.

669
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:17,345
When we were dating you
never wore anything of mine,

670
00:27:17,448 --> 00:27:18,814
except that one time
when you wore my thong.

671
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:21,216
Okay, back to the case.

672
00:27:34,998 --> 00:27:36,498
There was a photo in Davis's dorm room.

673
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,999
He was wearing a necklace.

674
00:27:38,102 --> 00:27:40,402
Stella had the same necklace
at the club that night.

675
00:27:40,504 --> 00:27:41,753
Ah, you see, look!

676
00:27:41,872 --> 00:27:42,921
I'm not the only guy who shares necklaces

677
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:44,439
with his lady friends.

678
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:46,041
Stella and Davis had a thing.

679
00:27:46,143 --> 00:27:47,809
Your crush Stella was having an affair

680
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:49,377
with Davis.

681
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,146
She's not my crush, okay?

682
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:53,782
I just liked her version of
<i>You Make Me Feel So Young.</i>

683
00:27:57,488 --> 00:28:03,108
♪ You made me feel so ♪

684
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:09,531
♪ You made me feel so ♪

685
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:17,205
♪ You made me feel so young ♪

686
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:21,042
"You<i> made</i> me feel so young."

687
00:28:21,145 --> 00:28:24,212
"You<i> made</i> me feel so young." Past tense.

688
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:26,414
And the drummer said that
Stella changed the arrangement

689
00:28:26,517 --> 00:28:28,433
right before they went on stage.

690
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:31,520
What if she was singing
it for her lover Davis?

691
00:28:31,605 --> 00:28:33,688
What if she was dedicating that song to him

692
00:28:33,774 --> 00:28:37,025
because she knew he was dead?

693
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:39,027
I'm gonna talk to Stella.

694
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,733
Oh, hi.

695
00:28:44,835 --> 00:28:46,234
Roger, right?

696
00:28:46,336 --> 00:28:47,702
Kinda early for tonight's show.

697
00:28:47,804 --> 00:28:50,639
You remember my fake name.

698
00:28:50,741 --> 00:28:54,142
Lieutenant Burns, NYPD.

699
00:28:54,244 --> 00:28:55,277
What's this about?

700
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:58,547
Davis Bennett.

701
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:02,851
I liked you a lot better
as a record executive.

702
00:29:02,953 --> 00:29:06,638
Come on in.

703
00:29:06,723 --> 00:29:09,824
This is your dressing room?

704
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:13,929
Welcome to the high-class
world of being a jazz singer.

705
00:29:14,031 --> 00:29:16,531
I know you and Davis shared a necklace.

706
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:18,033
Tell me what else you shared.

707
00:29:18,135 --> 00:29:19,935
That's crazy. I'm with Marco.

708
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,987
All it takes is one phone call, Stella.

709
00:29:22,105 --> 00:29:24,439
We can have crime scene techs
comb through your apartment.

710
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:27,509
They'll find Davis's
prints, they'll find his DNA.

711
00:29:27,611 --> 00:29:28,927
[sighs]

712
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:34,933
Davis and I started

713
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:36,818
seeing each other months ago.

714
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,287
He was just a kid, but when he played,

715
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:41,289
he could be any age.

716
00:29:41,391 --> 00:29:43,959
It was jazz, you know?

717
00:29:44,061 --> 00:29:45,794
I had to get close to that.

718
00:29:45,896 --> 00:29:48,063
I didn't mean to break his heart.

719
00:29:48,165 --> 00:29:50,665
That's why his plane took off.

720
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:52,067
He was in love.

721
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:54,803
I told him we'd never work,

722
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:56,688
but he believed love always wins.

723
00:29:56,807 --> 00:29:59,975
Who killed him?

724
00:30:00,077 --> 00:30:02,944
Stella, if Davis meant anything to you,

725
00:30:03,046 --> 00:30:05,413
help us nail his killer.

726
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:07,215
I can't.

727
00:30:07,317 --> 00:30:09,067
If he finds out I even talked to you...

728
00:30:09,186 --> 00:30:11,086
If Marco finds out?

729
00:30:17,361 --> 00:30:18,994
He suspected us for weeks.

730
00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:21,963
Ever since he saw us talking after a show,

731
00:30:22,065 --> 00:30:23,531
he started threatening me,

732
00:30:23,617 --> 00:30:26,201
telling me to stay away from him.

733
00:30:26,303 --> 00:30:28,937
I tried to tell Davis,
"You can't cross Marco.

734
00:30:29,072 --> 00:30:31,106
He's crazy."

735
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:35,677
Two nights ago, Davis
followed me home from the club.

736
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:39,531
I let him up, I told him we had to end it,

737
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,666
but suddenly, Marco appeared there

738
00:30:41,785 --> 00:30:43,618
with two of his guys and he threatened him

739
00:30:43,704 --> 00:30:45,620
and he told him never
to come to the club again

740
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:47,956
and never to talk to me,

741
00:30:48,091 --> 00:30:51,259
but Davis refused.

742
00:30:51,345 --> 00:30:55,013
I begged him not to hurt him.

743
00:30:55,132 --> 00:30:57,882
I begged him.

744
00:30:57,968 --> 00:31:00,302
It's my fault.

745
00:31:00,437 --> 00:31:03,972
Marco shot him, but it's my fault.

746
00:31:08,777 --> 00:31:11,111
Hang tight, we got this.

747
00:31:18,537 --> 00:31:20,704
You gotta feel pretty relieved
that Leo's in the clear, right?

748
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:22,455
I am.

749
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:23,790
Stella holding up okay?

750
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:25,375
Yeah, considering.

751
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,427
She's pretty torn up about everything.

752
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:28,845
You know, if there's one thing
I learned in high school, Al,

753
00:31:28,964 --> 00:31:31,298
it's that star-crossed
love never ends well.

754
00:31:31,383 --> 00:31:33,350
You had a star-crossed
love affair in high school?

755
00:31:33,468 --> 00:31:34,851
No, me, no.

756
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,219
High school English, <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

757
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:37,554
I did okay in high school, Al.

758
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:39,639
Yeah, I'm sure.

759
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:40,940
How's Denny doing?

760
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:43,610
Well, he's just getting started.

761
00:31:48,483 --> 00:31:50,700
Ah.

762
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:53,453
Now, look, I am sorry about
what happened to your boy Alec.

763
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:56,323
I have plenty more where he came from.

764
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,658
Oh.

765
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:01,828
You think you're getting
out of here, don't you?

766
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,963
I got your balls in a vice.

767
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:05,865
Stella's neighbors said they heard

768
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,967
what they thought was a car backfiring

769
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:10,553
at 2:30 in the morning,
but it wasn't a car.

770
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:15,342
That was you firing a
round into Davis's chest.

771
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:17,477
I had no problem with that kid.

772
00:32:17,562 --> 00:32:19,679
Yeah, sure.

773
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,681
Till you caught him nailing Stella.

774
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:23,483
See, I imagine a guy like you doesn't stand

775
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:26,770
for some punk half his age
giving it to his girl, right?

776
00:32:26,855 --> 00:32:29,356
They were never together.

777
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:30,824
That kid was stalking Stella.

778
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:31,941
He was obsessed with her.

779
00:32:32,027 --> 00:32:34,661
Marco, come on.

780
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,746
You've heard Stella sing, right?

781
00:32:36,865 --> 00:32:38,832
She can really sell it, can't she?

782
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:40,033
She wouldn't lie to me.

783
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:42,502
Oh, you seem like a generous guy.

784
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:44,704
I am...

785
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,039
with people I like.

786
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:48,842
Like Stella?

787
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:54,547
See, we looked into it.

788
00:32:54,633 --> 00:32:56,933
- You bought her a necklace?
- So what?

789
00:32:57,052 --> 00:32:58,718
So...

790
00:33:01,723 --> 00:33:04,190
She gave it to Davis.

791
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:08,862
Yeah, they'd been seeing
each other for months.

792
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:10,563
(Al) He didn't know.

793
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:11,898
What?

794
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:13,450
You see Marco's reaction?

795
00:33:13,568 --> 00:33:14,901
He didn't know about the affair.

796
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:18,738
Look at him. Doesn't he look happy?

797
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:21,908
Doesn't that make you mad?

798
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:25,745
How about you tell me
what you did with the gun

799
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:27,714
after you shot Davis?

800
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,215
We're done here.

801
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:31,084
Hey, no, I think Mr. Vrioni
can decide for himself

802
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:32,635
if he wants to cooperate.

803
00:33:32,754 --> 00:33:33,970
Here's why we're done.

804
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:35,805
You've got your picture, we've got ours.

805
00:33:35,924 --> 00:33:38,591
Take a look.

806
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,427
Mr. Vrioni was at a restaurant

807
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:42,479
in Manhattan with Alec
Hyka and ten other witnesses

808
00:33:42,597 --> 00:33:44,647
at 2:30 a.m. the night in question.

809
00:33:44,766 --> 00:33:46,483
[groans]

810
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:55,108
[tense music]

811
00:34:02,784 --> 00:34:04,117
I don't know.

812
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:05,785
Maybe he gave it to one of his thugs to do.

813
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:07,787
I don't think Marco knew
about Davis and Stella.

814
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:09,456
So then how'd it go down?

815
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:11,407
The only person who's
admitted to being with Davis

816
00:34:11,493 --> 00:34:15,011
at the time of his death is Stella.

817
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,796
Her?

818
00:34:16,882 --> 00:34:18,631
I don't know, why does she do it?

819
00:34:18,717 --> 00:34:20,216
And how does she get his body
out of her place all by herself?

820
00:34:20,302 --> 00:34:21,801
I said Marco didn't know about the affair.

821
00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:23,720
I think he did know about the murder.

822
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:25,688
