00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,915
JOHNNY MNEMONIC

2
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:25,642
Good morning.
This is your wake-up call.

3
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,451
Thank you for staying
at the New Darwin lnn.

4
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,856
The time is 10:30 a.m.

5
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:39,900
You have no new messages.

6
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:46,898
Johnny?

7
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,609
- Yeah?
- Never mind.

8
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:59,519
NAS: Nerve Attenuation Syndrome.

9
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:01,646
So where is home?

10
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,782
Johnny?

11
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:05,792
Home?

12
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:13,256
Would you believe
I don't even know?

13
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:15,097
Yes. I would.

14
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:17,000
Going out?

15
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:19,597
Getting some ice.

16
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:25,376
We've got...

17
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:28,707
ice.

18
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,037
Pick it up, Ralfi.

19
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,365
How about it?

20
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,740
You said you'd lock down a date
for the procedure.

21
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:58,745
And hello to you too.

22
00:03:58,813 --> 00:04:01,748
Ralfi. The date. When?

23
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:05,980
I'm sorry, Johnny. The Sheba surgeons
have changed their quote.

24
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:08,715
You told me 800K would cover it.

25
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,258
The fee for removing the implant
is now one-million-five.

26
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:14,351
That is complete memory recovery.

27
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:16,760
If you don't want it all back...

28
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:19,026
they may come down.

29
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:24,036
If I just wanted the silicon
dug out ot my brain...

30
00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:26,198
I could go to Mexico City!

31
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:30,233
I want a full restoration!
I want it all back.

32
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,803
Johnny, the Sheba boys,
they set the price.

33
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:36,714
- I've done what I can.
- Come on, Ralfi.

34
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:39,150
One more run, Johnny.

35
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,053
And then you could cover it,
provided it's a rich one.

36
00:04:45,193 --> 00:04:46,785
What have you got?

37
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:50,695
It depends.
Did you get that upgrade?

38
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:57,934
Very good. Pick-up is in central Beijing
tomorrow night, 10:00.

39
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:00,872
This is the big one.

40
00:05:00,942 --> 00:05:02,876
Don't be late, Johnny.

41
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:18,617
Paging Mr. Smith.

42
00:06:26,794 --> 00:06:29,991
NAS, the so-called black shakes...

43
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:34,626
first identified in 2010
in a small population--

44
00:06:34,702 --> 00:06:38,160
Snatch back your brain, zombie,
and hold it!

45
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:40,673
Sorry, technical ditficulty.

46
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:42,675
Please come in.

47
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,994
Activating Pemex Memory Doubler.

48
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:06,590
Your present capacity:
80 gigabytes.

49
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,601
Doubler loading.

50
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:18,210
Your storage capacity is now
160 gigabytes.

51
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,770
Warning: Do not exceed capacity.

52
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:33,257
The courier is late.

53
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,760
Be calm.

54
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,607
Double cheese? Anchovies?

55
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,609
You are Mister--

56
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,168
- Smith.
- You are late.

57
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:53,543
Right.

58
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:04,986
Question.

59
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:08,989
You're not the kind ot people
I usually work for.

60
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:12,765
We are new at this.

61
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,266
No shit.

62
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,403
We approached you
through the correct channels.

63
00:08:18,472 --> 00:08:22,738
We paid half to the Swiss account
exactly as your agent instructed.

64
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,540
Here's your ticket.
First class.

65
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,515
Let's see the upload.

66
00:08:34,455 --> 00:08:36,082
Motion detector.

67
00:08:37,258 --> 00:08:39,658
How much am I carrying?

68
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,285
320 gigabytes.

69
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,498
Your storage capacity?

70
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,090
Where am I taking it?

71
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:49,636
Newark.

72
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:51,671
Your storage capacity?

73
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:56,267
More than adequate.

74
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:01,806
Somebody'll take him
to Las Vegas?

75
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:04,715
It is extremely dangerous...

76
00:09:04,785 --> 00:09:07,652
if the upload volume
exceeds your storage capacity.

77
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:10,884
Synaptic seepage can kill you
in two or three days.

78
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,357
Plus, the data...

79
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,692
may be corrupted and coherent download
will be impossible.

80
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:20,500
We don't have a problem.

81
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,465
Are we loading or not?

82
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,032
Your ticket.

83
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,703
Ralfi, your agent...

84
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,111
will arrange the meet
for the download.

85
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:24,557
When the counter approaches zero...

86
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:27,123
click on three frames off the TV.

87
00:10:28,802 --> 00:10:32,431
Any three. They'll meld with the data,
and I won't know what they are.

88
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,940
That's the download code.

89
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,874
You get a hard copy.

90
00:10:36,944 --> 00:10:40,402
You fax one copy
to your connection on the other side.

91
00:10:40,481 --> 00:10:42,972
When I get there,
we feed in the code and download.

92
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,677
Understand?

93
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:56,227
Upload begins
when you press here.

94
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,259
Who's the target?

95
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:03,667
Scientists.

96
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:06,399
PharmaKom R&D people.

97
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:08,498
Detectors.

98
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,774
Hit me.

99
00:11:54,622 --> 00:11:55,646
The access code.

100
00:12:33,694 --> 00:12:36,094
Mr. Smith?

101
00:12:39,566 --> 00:12:41,534
Where's the bathroom?

102
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:43,593
- What?
- The toilet.

103
00:12:51,745 --> 00:12:53,110
Destroy the original!

104
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,307
Fax the images to Newark.

105
00:13:07,094 --> 00:13:09,858
Oh, Jesus! Shit!

106
00:13:41,662 --> 00:13:44,392
Water temperature is 17 degrees.

107
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:40,948
Next time, knock, baldy.

108
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:04,373
Transmission commencing.

109
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,511
Transmission interrupted.

110
00:15:28,335 --> 00:15:29,597
Get him!

111
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:47,152
You!

112
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:49,189
Where is he going?

113
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:54,218
Where is he taking the data?

114
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:55,886
Newark!

115
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,087
Immigration control.
Please insert passport.

116
00:16:59,092 --> 00:17:01,583
Beginning scan.

117
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,596
Warning: Implant detected.

118
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:11,661
Scanning dyslexia
prosthesis implant.

119
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:15,140
Government approved.

120
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,472
Warning: detected synaptic seepage.

121
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:19,478
Neural failure within 24 hours.

122
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:21,707
Seek medical attention immediately.

123
00:17:21,782 --> 00:17:23,010
Thank you.

124
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,778
Welcome to Newark.

125
00:17:26,286 --> 00:17:28,948
Final boarding call,
Western Pacific Air...

126
00:17:29,022 --> 00:17:32,219
flight 86, gate 113.

127
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,696
Tokyo wants me to recover
the stolen data...

128
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:16,963
for PharmaKominat Industries
of Zurich.

129
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:21,930
Our operation in Beijing
met with limited success.

130
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:24,307
The PharmaKom traitors are dead.

131
00:18:24,378 --> 00:18:26,710
The courier, however,
escaped with the data.

132
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,714
He's on his way here,
to Newark.

133
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:33,382
I didn't want to disturb you
in your grief.

134
00:18:33,453 --> 00:18:37,082
It must be very difticult
to lose an only child.

135
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,562
I can't say.

136
00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:52,462
I'm to recover the head
of the mnemonic courier...

137
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:54,905
cryogenically preserved.

138
00:18:54,975 --> 00:18:57,136
The traitors wiped
the PharmaKom mainframe.

139
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,201
If we lose the courier...

140
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,906
they've lost the data forever.

141
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:03,142
If the courier is in Newark...

142
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:05,776
it's my responsibility.

143
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:08,013
You have part of the courier's...

144
00:19:08,088 --> 00:19:10,215
download code.

145
00:19:33,113 --> 00:19:35,809
Just what's the deal here?

146
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:38,817
Johnny boy, my ass.
What's the fucking score here?

147
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:41,183
I'm way overloaded, man.

148
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:43,484
You would not believe how much.

149
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,923
You told me you got upgraded.

150
00:19:45,992 --> 00:19:49,257
Yeah, I did.
I got the goods.

151
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:52,594
I want them out of my head.
Did they get the code out?

152
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,794
Don't worry.
They said they can extract.

153
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:58,030
Extract?

154
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,003
What's going on, Ralfi?
This feels like a blown deal, man.

155
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,773
You say you have to get
the data out.

156
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:10,943
They are the only ones who can do it.
There's no other choice.

157
00:20:11,017 --> 00:20:14,851
Trust me. I will tell the driver
where to take you.

158
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,606
Spider, I need to get some work.

159
00:20:36,676 --> 00:20:38,803
About these episodes
you've been having.

160
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:41,609
I want to get you back to the shop
for some tests.

161
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:43,911
Hey, are you listening?

162
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:46,919
No more playing doctor,
remember?

163
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:49,581
That's not what I meant.

164
00:20:51,658 --> 00:20:53,091
Look.

165
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,287
They must be the oldest bodyguards
in town.

166
00:20:55,362 --> 00:20:57,728
I'm twice as fast as they are.

167
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,164
I'm worried about
your nervous system!

168
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:03,031
Especially if you continue
being a bodyguard.

169
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:11,767
Get out of here, bitch.

170
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:13,745
Take it easy.

171
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:18,106
Your hired muscle's
aging on you, Ralfi.

172
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:21,244
I could've done you.

173
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,289
Time you hired
some young and fast.

174
00:21:23,356 --> 00:21:25,950
You mean like you?

175
00:21:26,026 --> 00:21:28,017
You're the best agent
for bodyguards in town.

176
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,790
I'm the fastest,
now Spider's jacked my system.

177
00:21:31,865 --> 00:21:33,594
Hold out your hand.

178
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:36,593
Okay.

179
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:41,502
Fine. Just hold it there.

180
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:45,536
So?

181
00:21:45,612 --> 00:21:48,706
Just hold it there.
You can hold it.

182
00:21:48,782 --> 00:21:51,273
- Can't you?
- Yeah. Sure.

183
00:21:54,287 --> 00:21:55,618
See?

184
00:21:56,156 --> 00:21:57,987
Cheap street implants.

185
00:21:59,826 --> 00:22:01,418
You're damaged goods.

186
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:04,019
Spider man jacked you up
all right.

187
00:22:04,097 --> 00:22:06,327
Jacked her up so tight
she shakes.

188
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:09,766
I cannot use you,
not for muscle.

189
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:13,772
Ever considered something
a little less actively physical?

190
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,673
Like on your back, babe?

191
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:19,405
Or on your knees.

192
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:23,015
I'll get a gig, Ralfi.

193
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,108
Then I'm coming back for you.

194
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:27,050
Sure.

195
00:22:51,845 --> 00:22:53,972
Yo, J-Bone.

196
00:23:06,393 --> 00:23:09,123
What you clocking, man?

197
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:11,129
Some suit out from the city.

198
00:23:11,197 --> 00:23:12,596
What for?

199
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:16,659
I don't know.
Suits don't come out here.

200
00:23:43,563 --> 00:23:45,224
You're Johnny?

201
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,697
Am I?

202
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:49,735
I sure hope so.
Come on in.

203
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,828
We're here to help you.

204
00:24:01,114 --> 00:24:04,106
We've got to stop meeting
like this.

205
00:24:04,184 --> 00:24:05,742
Baldy.

206
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,480
Doctor will see you now.

207
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:13,050
You lied.

208
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,192
Time to die.

209
00:24:22,268 --> 00:24:23,633
Time?

210
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:40,985
We've got all night, asshole!

211
00:24:41,054 --> 00:24:44,751
- Let me see it.
- Shut up, man.

212
00:25:05,578 --> 00:25:06,670
Yo, J-man.

213
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:38,904
Toad!

214
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,007
You weren't on the menu.

215
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,144
- I want you to do something.
- Do?

216
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,882
Yes. Say 'bye.

217
00:25:58,898 --> 00:26:00,832
Hold it right there.

218
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:26,520
You're fooling up.

219
00:26:27,594 --> 00:26:30,222
As long as you understand
one thing:

220
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:33,663
We're even.
I don't owe you shit.

221
00:26:34,734 --> 00:26:36,326
Who are you?

222
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:38,962
I'm J-Bone.

223
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:40,972
I run Heaven.

224
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,678
The LoTek headquarters.

225
00:26:57,557 --> 00:27:01,357
Easy as apple pie
Easy as app--

226
00:27:01,427 --> 00:27:03,725
- Johnny!
- They were waiting for me, Ralfi.

227
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:06,128
Two big, nasty men!

228
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:09,794
Johnny, please.
Let me explain. Johnny!

229
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:12,770
You set me up, my triend.

230
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,434
Johnny, it's not my fault.
There's been a screw-up!

231
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,910
You're dead if you don't get
this stuff out ot my head.

232
00:27:22,382 --> 00:27:24,748
Shit!

233
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:27,650
Not on the head!

234
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,585
Don't tell me you hit him
on the head.

235
00:27:43,603 --> 00:27:45,537
This way.

236
00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:54,212
Hooky, give me my shit.

237
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,214
Come on.

238
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:25,111
Looks like he's coming 'round.

239
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:27,341
Looks like he's coming 'round.

240
00:28:32,852 --> 00:28:34,786
How you feeling, Johnny?

241
00:28:36,022 --> 00:28:37,649
What'd they upload?

242
00:28:37,724 --> 00:28:40,716
The goddamn Library ot Congress?

243
00:28:40,793 --> 00:28:43,489
Feels like my brain's gonna explode.

244
00:28:43,563 --> 00:28:47,329
I think your friend
can take care of that.

245
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,800
Ralfi, you lying sack of shit.

246
00:28:58,878 --> 00:29:00,846
Please, let's work this out
like gentlemen.

247
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:03,905
In this business, you only fuck up once
with the Yakuza.

248
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:05,780
We'll need a bucket.

249
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,157
Put it here beside the table.

250
00:29:14,227 --> 00:29:15,888
Can we talk?

251
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,520
Talk.

252
00:29:17,597 --> 00:29:20,259
I have one image of the access code.
You have the other two.

253
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:23,029
I'll give you the data.
Everybody happy.

254
00:29:23,102 --> 00:29:25,627
You don't understand.

255
00:29:25,705 --> 00:29:29,402
They want the data and
everything it's ever been stored in.

256
00:29:29,475 --> 00:29:31,807
There's less danger
ot intormation decay.

257
00:29:31,878 --> 00:29:34,278
We don't have to worry
about anyone going in...

258
00:29:34,347 --> 00:29:36,508
with mnemonic sensors.

259
00:29:38,484 --> 00:29:40,543
These days, you see...

260
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:45,287
dead men can tell tales.

261
00:29:45,358 --> 00:29:48,850
There's some way
to work this out!

262
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,020
There is.

263
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,229
Hurry up. Please.

264
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:15,645
What is going on?

265
00:30:15,722 --> 00:30:17,917
I'll slit his fucking throat, bitch.

266
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:21,391
So? The other guy's gonna
cut his whole head off.

267
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:26,831
- Say we pay you to walk away?
- I'll pay 20 grand.

268
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:30,325
You wouldn't believe
the shit you're in.

269
00:30:30,403 --> 00:30:31,335
Fifty.

270
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:33,832
Deal.

271
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:37,006
You bitch!

272
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,465
It's okay.
I got the gun. Let's go.

273
00:31:11,644 --> 00:31:14,340
Time to go!

274
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,381
Bitch!

275
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:24,684
Hey! You could have
fucking killed me!

276
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,055
Get out ot my way!

277
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,009
What are you doing?

278
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:47,545
My gear.

279
00:32:21,347 --> 00:32:23,372
In here.

280
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,033
Back door.

281
00:33:21,107 --> 00:33:22,870
Thanks, J-Bone.

282
00:33:23,943 --> 00:33:25,535
We'll find you again!

283
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:27,272
Count on it!

284
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:32,183
Down!

285
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,250
You LoTeks will regret this.

286
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,622
I have to get on-line.
Must be some way to square this.

287
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,134
Fifty thou', you said.

288
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:53,100
Time I see the color.

289
00:33:53,172 --> 00:33:56,198
Right. You were terrific.

290
00:33:56,275 --> 00:33:59,711
So if you'll point the way out
and give me an account number--

291
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:01,713
Account number?

292
00:34:02,815 --> 00:34:04,806
I'm on you till you pay.

293
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:13,015
How come they want
to cut off your head?

294
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,287
Usually they just
off people around here.

295
00:34:15,361 --> 00:34:16,692
Long story.

296
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:19,322
I'm gonna be around
until I get paid, so--

297
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:22,890
I can carry nearly 80 gigs ot data
in my head.

298
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,903
160 if I use a doubler.

299
00:34:24,971 --> 00:34:28,429
But somebody stuck in more,
and I don't know how to get it out.

300
00:34:28,507 --> 00:34:31,499
Wait. You're a smuggler?
In your head?

301
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:37,139
What's wrong?

302
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:41,276
Come here. Sit down.

303
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,954
Oh, man, you are fucked up severe.

304
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,965
Stay quiet, boy. Okay?

305
00:35:02,942 --> 00:35:04,534
Papa!

306
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,843
Takahashi. How sad.

307
00:35:09,915 --> 00:35:12,110
The loss of a child.

308
00:35:12,184 --> 00:35:16,382
They know that your purpose
in life has been lost.

309
00:35:16,455 --> 00:35:18,446
It died with your daughter.

310
00:35:18,524 --> 00:35:21,322
You have become a risk to them.

311
00:35:21,394 --> 00:35:23,487
Take a good look
at their errand boy.

312
00:35:23,562 --> 00:35:26,395
The one who wants
the courier's head.

313
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:28,057
He's plotting to destroy you.

314
00:35:28,134 --> 00:35:31,365
You must neutralize him,
Takahashi.

315
00:35:31,437 --> 00:35:33,803
I promise you...

316
00:35:33,873 --> 00:35:37,468
the courier,
what he carries...

317
00:35:37,543 --> 00:35:39,738
can give you new purpose in life.

318
00:35:39,812 --> 00:35:43,441
I was PharmaKom,
and I--

319
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,314
They're listening.

320
00:35:48,054 --> 00:35:49,578
They're everywhere.

321
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:20,180
It's just my stuff.

322
00:36:20,252 --> 00:36:24,416
Mace, throwing spikes, grenade.

323
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,424
Everything a girl needs.

324
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,624
You let me sleep?

325
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:32,288
You needed it.

326
00:36:36,268 --> 00:36:38,759
I'm in a hurry.

327
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:41,204
I'm dead if I don't get this
out ot my head.

328
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:49,514
Hey. Do you ever sneak a look
at what you carry?

329
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:53,348
Usually there's a code,
like a lock.

330
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,410
Well, when there isn't?

331
00:36:55,488 --> 00:36:58,116
No. It goes with the territory.

332
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,250
Sater for me
and the client.

333
00:37:01,327 --> 00:37:03,522
How come you knew those, uh--

334
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,530
Oh, call them LoTeks.

335
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,294
I sort ot hung with them
when I was a kid.

336
00:37:10,002 --> 00:37:13,995
How do you fit all that shit
in your head anyway?

337
00:37:14,073 --> 00:37:17,133
Must have been pretty good
at memorizing, huh?

338
00:37:17,209 --> 00:37:19,473
Implant. Wet-wired.

339
00:37:19,545 --> 00:37:21,809
I had to dump a chunk
of long-term memory.

340
00:37:21,881 --> 00:37:24,111
You had to dump what?

341
00:37:24,183 --> 00:37:25,616
My childhood.

342
00:37:25,684 --> 00:37:27,618
Your childhood?

343
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,154
Really?

344
00:37:33,592 --> 00:37:38,154
All of it?
You can't remember a thing?

345
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,289
Maybe there's some residual traces.

346
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:44,928
Every now and then there's something,
but I can never hold onto it.

347
00:37:45,004 --> 00:37:47,165
That's a seriously
weird-ass thing to do.

348
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:50,174
Maybe I didn't lose anything
I wanted to keep.

349
00:37:50,242 --> 00:37:52,836
I needed the space for the job.

350
00:37:52,912 --> 00:37:54,846
You got parents and stuff?

351
00:37:54,914 --> 00:37:57,678
You got parents and stuff?

352
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,344
Yeah. Once.

353
00:38:00,419 --> 00:38:03,946
But I haven't seen them in years.

354
00:38:04,023 --> 00:38:07,550
Anyway, I don't think
about it much, okay?

355
00:38:07,626 --> 00:38:09,958
What do you think about?

356
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,321
When you're alone?

357
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:17,028
I think I want to get out
of this rat hole.

358
00:38:17,102 --> 00:38:21,801
I want to get on-line.
I need a computer!

359
00:38:22,942 --> 00:38:24,876
Where'd you learn to do that?

360
00:38:24,944 --> 00:38:27,742
I used to have a summer job
breaking and entering.

361
00:38:48,734 --> 00:38:50,929
I need a Sino-Logic 16...

362
00:38:51,003 --> 00:38:54,700
Sogo-7 data-gloves,
a GPL stealth module...

363
00:38:54,773 --> 00:38:59,073
one Burdine intelligent translator
and Thompson eye phones.

364
00:39:29,675 --> 00:39:32,610
Password, enter.

365
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,738

11:15 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.

377
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:28,927
He'll try to make a move.

378
00:40:29,001 --> 00:40:31,526
He'll use his connections on the net.

379
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:33,093
Narrow the bandwidth.

380
00:40:33,172 --> 00:40:35,640
Go low rent.

381
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:37,403
On-line translation.

382
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,944
Translator selected.

383
00:40:40,012 --> 00:40:44,142
Shit. It's just an all-night
copy shop...

384
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:46,480
they were faxing to
here in Newark.

386
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,083
Hold it.

387
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,786
Command terminated.

388
00:40:57,096 --> 00:40:59,087
Come on, baby.

389
00:40:59,164 --> 00:41:02,600
All the way back to Newark.

390
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,102
Copy shop.

391
00:41:08,173 --> 00:41:09,504
It's here.

392
00:41:09,575 --> 00:41:11,236
Fax buffer selected.

393
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,404
Part of it's here
in the buffer of their fax modem.

394
00:41:20,486 --> 00:41:23,478
Nothing but a name:
Dr. Allcome.

395
00:41:23,555 --> 00:41:25,523
Nothing came through.

396
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:26,922
Shit!

397
00:41:32,931 --> 00:41:34,364
Let's go.

398
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:38,267
No, I'm gonna try something else.
A guy called Strike.

399
00:41:38,337 --> 00:41:41,829
He runs a board in this sector.
Maybe he can find this doctor.

400
00:41:46,245 --> 00:41:47,473
We're on him.

401
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:51,312
He's using a Sino-Logic 16,
GPL stealth module.

402
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,873
Crazy Bob's Computer Shop...

403
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:57,081
5326 Sutton Plaza,
back room.

404
00:41:57,156 --> 00:41:59,522
Initiate the virus.

Access denied.

406
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,864
Let me in.

Access granted.

408
00:42:10,102 --> 00:42:14,835
Get off my board, man.
You are too hot.

409
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,671
You're a hit waiting to happen.

410
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,074
Off!

411
00:42:19,144 --> 00:42:20,771
You owe me, Strike.

412
00:42:20,846 --> 00:42:22,336
I don't owe you that much.

413
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:25,474
I could crash you from here.
Wipe out your board!

414
00:42:25,551 --> 00:42:30,045
Johnny, don't, man.
That's my livelihood.

415
00:42:30,122 --> 00:42:33,649
Then stop bullshitting me.
I need to know what I'm holding.

416
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:35,989
Why is the Yakuza after it?
Who's Dr. Allcome?

417
00:42:36,061 --> 00:42:38,427
All I know is...

418
00:42:38,497 --> 00:42:41,625
you've got a head
full of PharmaKom data...

419
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,727
and they've hired the Yakuza
to get it out.

420
00:42:45,804 --> 00:42:48,136
PharmaKom?

421
00:42:48,207 --> 00:42:52,507
Shit! They put a virus on us.

422
00:42:57,082 --> 00:43:01,542
Get out of here, man!
I never heard of any Dr. Malcolm.

423
00:43:04,356 --> 00:43:07,655
Johnny. Hurry, Johnny.
They're coming.

424
00:43:07,726 --> 00:43:09,660
Who the hell are you?

425
00:43:09,728 --> 00:43:11,320
Got to go now.

426
00:43:11,396 --> 00:43:13,125
Come on.

427
00:43:20,506 --> 00:43:21,768
Watch this.

428
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,749
Inform Takahashi...

429
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:39,689
his tracker was late
in locating the courier.

430
00:43:39,758 --> 00:43:41,988
It seems he's already departed.

431
00:43:45,931 --> 00:43:48,798
Mr. Takahashi, Shinji has failed
again to locate the courier.

432
00:43:48,867 --> 00:43:50,835
Get me Karl.

433
00:43:53,872 --> 00:43:57,308
Church of the Retransfiguration.
Thank you for calling.

434
00:44:06,151 --> 00:44:08,085
I need your services.

435
00:44:08,153 --> 00:44:10,053
We hold services nightly.

436
00:44:10,122 --> 00:44:12,249
You should join us.

437
00:44:12,324 --> 00:44:13,916
A special one.

438
00:44:13,992 --> 00:44:18,486
You need someone
brought to Jesus...

439
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:22,191
or to you?

440
00:44:22,267 --> 00:44:25,100
Only one part: his head.

441
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:29,072
And who is this lost soul?

442
00:44:29,141 --> 00:44:32,577
This sinner unrepentant?

443
00:44:32,644 --> 00:44:34,544
A courier.

444
00:44:34,613 --> 00:44:37,639
Last seen at the drome.
Name is Johnny.

445
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:41,709
If you get me the head in 24 hours...

446
00:44:41,787 --> 00:44:43,516
triple the fee.

447
00:44:48,994 --> 00:44:52,987
Karl, do not fail me.

448
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,535
Hey! What are you doing?

449
00:45:04,943 --> 00:45:06,535
Mind if I use this?

450
00:45:06,612 --> 00:45:10,048
Man owes me 50 thou',
and he's scamming my phone card.

451
00:45:10,115 --> 00:45:12,049
And it's still our first date.

452
00:45:17,322 --> 00:45:19,256
Welcome to AT&T.

453
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,152
Enter password.

454
00:45:36,908 --> 00:45:39,308
This is an unlisted number.
How did you get it?

455
00:45:39,378 --> 00:45:40,970
Don't like surprises?

456
00:45:41,046 --> 00:45:44,846
No, and it's a federal offense
to hack shielded lines.

457
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:48,249
I have 320 gigabytes
of PharmaKom data.

458
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,188
Don't bother.
I'll be out ot here in 20 seconds.

459
00:45:53,525 --> 00:45:56,221
So, what exactly is it
that you want?

460
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,263
Your data out of my head.

461
00:45:58,330 --> 00:45:59,695
That can be arranged.

462
00:45:59,765 --> 00:46:01,596
Let's meet.

463
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:02,759
Where?

464
00:46:02,834 --> 00:46:02,868
They're gonna chop your head off!

465
00:46:02,868 --> 00:46:04,768
They're gonna chop your head off!

466
00:46:04,836 --> 00:46:06,770
They'll negotiate.
They're corporate.

467
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:08,965
So's the Yakuza.

468
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:10,975
If you don't come, fine.

469
00:46:11,043 --> 00:46:13,375
It's not your kind ot scene.

470
00:46:13,445 --> 00:46:16,039
If it works out, I'll pay you.
If it doesn't--

471
00:46:16,114 --> 00:46:18,480
If it doesn't,
you're one dead Johnny.

472
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:22,179
I will be anyway,
it I don't get this shit out of my head.

473
00:46:25,757 --> 00:46:27,190
Listen.

474
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,954
I know this guy Spider.

475
00:46:30,028 --> 00:46:33,657
Used to be a doctor.
He could help you.

476
00:46:33,732 --> 00:46:36,292
Fix your--

477
00:46:36,368 --> 00:46:38,802
Hey, what's with you?

478
00:46:41,473 --> 00:46:43,464
I'll be all right.

479
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:45,635
Jesus, you're sick!

480
00:46:45,711 --> 00:46:48,908
You strung out or what?
You got NAS!

481
00:46:49,581 --> 00:46:51,173
You have the black shakes.

482
00:46:51,249 --> 00:46:55,083
Whatever it is you have,
you're sidelined, right?

483
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:59,547
I've got to make this meeting.
Hey! Can you hear me?

484
00:47:03,628 --> 00:47:06,529
Spider. He could help you!

485
00:47:06,598 --> 00:47:08,930
He could help me.

486
00:47:40,298 --> 00:47:42,095
If you're not expected,
you're not invited.

487
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:43,964
So fuck off, okay?

488
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:47,129
It's Jane.
She says you know her.

489
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,773
Get down here, man.
She's sick.

490
00:48:13,165 --> 00:48:15,030
Look, I've got to run.

491
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,227
Shut up. Give me that
muscle relaxant over there.

492
00:48:17,302 --> 00:48:19,236
The red one.

493
00:48:23,842 --> 00:48:25,434
It's NAS, right?

494
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:28,138
Yeah, the black shakes.
Like half the people on the planet.

495
00:48:28,213 --> 00:48:31,182
Let me tell you something
so you get this straight.

496
00:48:31,249 --> 00:48:34,741
It's not my work that got her this way.
My work is clean.

497
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,879
Besides, you don't get this shit
from amp jobs.

498
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,183
That's a myth.

499
00:48:38,256 --> 00:48:41,487
So what does cause it?

500
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,585
The world causes it.
This causes it!

501
00:48:45,163 --> 00:48:48,098
Information overload,
all the electronics...

502
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:49,758
poisoning the airwaves!

503
00:48:49,835 --> 00:48:52,770
Technological fucking civilization!

504
00:48:52,838 --> 00:48:56,899
But we still have all this shit,
because we can't live without it.

505
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,603
Let me do my work.

506
00:49:10,622 --> 00:49:12,214
Whoa. Street preacher's out.

507
00:49:15,193 --> 00:49:17,354
J-Bone, you copying?

508
00:49:17,429 --> 00:49:20,057
That son ot a bitch doesn't have
one natural bone...

509
00:49:20,131 --> 00:49:21,530
left in his body.

510
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,534
He really a preacher, J-Bone?

511
00:49:23,602 --> 00:49:27,629
Preacher? That motherfucker's
got God and technology ass-backward.

512
00:49:27,706 --> 00:49:31,198
He'll kill anybody for money
just to keep his body full of implants.

513
00:49:31,276 --> 00:49:32,573
Want me to follow him?

514
00:49:32,644 --> 00:49:34,111
Stay away from him.

515
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,807
He's too crazy.

516
00:49:38,049 --> 00:49:40,483
Anna Kalmann, founder,
former CEO...

517
00:49:40,552 --> 00:49:43,680
of the multinational
PharmaKominat Industries, Zurich.

518
00:49:43,755 --> 00:49:48,055
Born August 1, 1965.
Died September 3, 2015.

519
00:49:48,126 --> 00:49:52,290
Died? Six years ago?

520
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,628
She was imprinted to PharmaKom's...

521
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:57,725
neural-net installation in Zurich
prior to onset of morbidity.

522
00:49:57,802 --> 00:49:59,099
Imprinted?

523
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,798
Her neural-net persona
has Swiss citizenship...

524
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:05,365
under the artificial
intelligence laws of 2006.

525
00:50:06,444 --> 00:50:10,574
She advises the current board
from this state ot being.

526
00:50:18,757 --> 00:50:20,691
PharmaKom, Newark.

527
00:50:25,931 --> 00:50:27,330
What are you doing?

528
00:50:28,433 --> 00:50:29,866
Just looking.

529
00:50:29,935 --> 00:50:33,803
Don't touch anything.
Who the fuck are you anyway?

530
00:50:35,607 --> 00:50:36,699
Johnny who?

531
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,135
Just Johnny.

532
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:51,778
It looks like a Full-service shop.
How are you on brain implants?

533
00:50:51,856 --> 00:50:54,518
Silicon implants, neural overlays,
memory augmentation?

534
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:58,290
We don't get much of that out here
in Newark, Just Johnny.

535
00:50:58,363 --> 00:51:00,593
Kind of upscale for us,
you know?

536
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:03,164
Got mine in Singapore.

537
00:51:03,234 --> 00:51:07,000
Oh, yeah?
What's your deal, Just Johnny?

538
00:51:08,306 --> 00:51:10,365
I got this problem.

539
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,000
Up here.

540
00:51:13,044 --> 00:51:16,946
"They err in vision.
They stumble in judgment.

541
00:51:17,015 --> 00:51:18,915
For all the tables are full...

542
00:51:18,984 --> 00:51:23,887
of vomit and filthiness.

543
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,423
So that there is no place clean."

544
00:51:26,491 --> 00:51:28,425
You should have seen it before.

545
00:51:28,493 --> 00:51:29,653
Isaiah.

546
00:51:29,728 --> 00:51:32,094
Isaiah? Mine's Hooky.

547
00:51:41,006 --> 00:51:43,668
Hey!

548
00:51:56,187 --> 00:51:59,452
The girl that took Ralfi's boy...

549
00:51:59,524 --> 00:52:01,458
out ot the back room.

550
00:52:03,762 --> 00:52:04,990
Who is she?

551
00:52:05,063 --> 00:52:06,792
You expect me to remember...

552
00:52:06,865 --> 00:52:08,628
halt the shit?

553
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,258
Heal!

554
00:52:16,608 --> 00:52:20,874
Oh, man.
Why'd you have to do that?

555
00:52:26,584 --> 00:52:28,950
- Who's the girl?
- A wanna be.

556
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:33,081
She's always hanging around here
looking for a job.

557
00:52:33,158 --> 00:52:34,648
Name?

558
00:52:34,726 --> 00:52:37,957
Jane.

559
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:41,521
More.

560
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,261
- One of Spider's jobs.
- Spider?

561
00:52:44,335 --> 00:52:48,829
He's a flesh mechanic--
implants and shit, you know?

562
00:52:48,907 --> 00:52:53,571
They said he used to
be a legit doctor once, but--

563
00:52:53,645 --> 00:52:54,669
Where?

564
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:22,603
They did some serious shoehorning
to get that in there.

565
00:53:22,674 --> 00:53:25,643
Let's skip the technical critique.
I need some help.

566
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:27,143
You don't know the half.

567
00:53:27,212 --> 00:53:30,079
Must be hurting like hell.

568
00:53:30,148 --> 00:53:34,107
Think I need you to tell me that?
I got 320 gigs in here.

569
00:53:34,185 --> 00:53:37,712
Yeah? What is it exactly?

570
00:53:37,789 --> 00:53:39,757
What kind of stuff?

571
00:53:39,824 --> 00:53:44,557
I haven't got a clue, and I don't have
a download code either.

572
00:53:51,636 --> 00:53:53,570
Hey.

573
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,440
You doing okay?

574
00:53:58,476 --> 00:54:00,068
Good girl, Janie.

575
00:54:00,145 --> 00:54:02,477
You brought him to the right place.

576
00:54:02,547 --> 00:54:04,344
You can fix him?

577
00:54:04,415 --> 00:54:06,474
I don't know.

578
00:54:06,551 --> 00:54:08,917
With his seepage,
if I could work a download...

579
00:54:08,987 --> 00:54:12,286
I don't know
if the product would be coherent.

580
00:54:12,357 --> 00:54:15,724
Fuck the product.
I just want it out.

581
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,386
I wish it was that simple.

582
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:21,355
Allcome. Dr. Allcome.

583
00:54:21,432 --> 00:54:22,865
Ever hear that name?

584
00:54:22,934 --> 00:54:24,902
- Maybe.
- Where is he?

585
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:27,995
Maybe! Why do you want to see him?

586
00:54:28,072 --> 00:54:30,006
Oh, come on, Spider.

587
00:54:30,074 --> 00:54:33,942
I'll make sure Just Johnny
gets to see who he needs to see...

588
00:54:34,012 --> 00:54:37,743
but you need bed rest, down time.

589
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,580
He's my client.

590
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:43,177
I'm telling you,
you've got to sleep!

591
00:54:43,254 --> 00:54:45,518
Just tell me where to go.

592
00:54:50,128 --> 00:54:52,494
All right.
I'll drive you.

593
00:54:52,564 --> 00:54:53,758
Right.

594
00:55:04,008 --> 00:55:05,635
- Halt, sinners!
- Fuck!

595
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:07,405
Spider, look out!

596
00:55:11,783 --> 00:55:13,648
Who the fuck was that?

597
00:55:13,718 --> 00:55:15,618
You don't want to know.

598
00:55:19,824 --> 00:55:21,758
Jesus.

599
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:42,045
Where are we?

600
00:55:42,113 --> 00:55:44,047
You'll see.

601
00:56:08,273 --> 00:56:12,573
He's been this way for an hour now.
I don't know what to do with him.

602
00:56:12,644 --> 00:56:14,612
It we still got any Paralon B,
give him 20 mg's.

603
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:16,647
Fucking PharmaKom, man.

604
00:56:16,714 --> 00:56:20,741
That shit costs two grand
per clinical unit.

605
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,186
Okay, keep him warm
and bring his charts.

606
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,871
Here are the charts, Doctor.

607
00:56:42,006 --> 00:56:44,304
Where's Dr. Allcome?

608
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:48,141
Dr. Allcome is a name
used when we've got a major problem...

609
00:56:48,212 --> 00:56:50,806
and don't want to spook the patients.

610
00:56:50,882 --> 00:56:55,080
"Doctor all come to ward seven."

611
00:56:55,153 --> 00:56:57,644
We drop everything
and haul ass to wherever.

612
00:56:57,722 --> 00:57:01,123
Usually means a crazy, somebody violent.

613
00:57:01,192 --> 00:57:02,682
But I saw it on the fax buffer.

614
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,955
That fax was meant for us.

615
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:09,830
Who's "us?"
Hey, wait a minute!

616
00:57:12,003 --> 00:57:13,436
Who's "us?"

617
00:57:13,504 --> 00:57:16,530
The NAS underground.
People who keep this place going.

618
00:57:16,607 --> 00:57:19,405
People like me.
Get on the table.

619
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,272
Why?

620
00:57:22,347 --> 00:57:26,113
Don't be a bigger asshole than you
have to. Just get on the table.

621
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:36,884
All right.

622
00:57:36,961 --> 00:57:38,895
Jack in.

623
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:47,404
Lie down.

624
00:57:50,808 --> 00:57:53,242
Let's take a look at this shit.

625
00:57:54,645 --> 00:57:56,237
No access code?

626
00:57:56,314 --> 00:57:58,305
Except for one image
out of three.

627
00:57:58,383 --> 00:58:01,819
It won't help.
What'd they use? Random images?

628
00:58:01,886 --> 00:58:03,877
Yeah. From the TV.

629
00:58:03,955 --> 00:58:07,982
I've got some decryption codes here.
I'll run them.

630
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:10,118
Janie, you should
really lie down.

631
00:58:10,194 --> 00:58:11,718
Can you break the code?

632
00:58:11,796 --> 00:58:14,458
If I get lucky.
Really lucky.

633
00:58:33,351 --> 00:58:34,943
Fuck!

634
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:36,680
No dice?

635
00:58:36,754 --> 00:58:38,483
- No. But I can get it out.
- How?

636
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:41,787
A general anesthetic,
a cranial drill and a pair of forceps.

637
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:43,918
I could die, right?

638
00:58:43,995 --> 00:58:45,656
It's gonna kill you anyway.

639
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:50,667
If I take it out, you'll probably
survive but lose some fine motor skills.

640
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:53,636
You might not remember anything
for more than three minutes.

641
00:58:53,704 --> 00:58:56,229
Fuck that!

642
00:58:56,307 --> 00:58:59,799
Let me tell you
what you've got in there...

643
00:58:59,877 --> 00:59:03,040
and what it's worth to the world!

644
00:59:03,114 --> 00:59:05,412
You're carrying
the cure for NAS.

645
00:59:07,218 --> 00:59:09,152
You're telling me I got--

646
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:12,815
PharmaKom's R&D on their cure
for Nerve Attenuation Syndrome.

647
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:17,623
Plus the field trials to prove
that it works-- and it really works.

648
00:59:18,463 --> 00:59:20,397
You mean, like a real cure?

649
00:59:20,465 --> 00:59:23,093
They could have you straightened out
in three weeks.

650
00:59:23,167 --> 00:59:25,965
You and everybody else.

651
00:59:26,037 --> 00:59:28,198
Everybody's trying
to cut off my head.

652
00:59:28,272 --> 00:59:32,368
So Saigon can run it through
a quantum interference detector.

653
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:34,468
Then they would have the cure.
We wouldn't.

654
00:59:34,545 --> 00:59:36,843
You keep that thing in your head
and nobody can save you.

655
00:59:36,914 --> 00:59:39,678
Plus, the cure is gone forever.

656
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,684
I can save the cure.

657
00:59:41,752 --> 00:59:45,552
Even with the code, the seepage is so
bad it'd probably come out as garbage.

658
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:48,990
What's it supposed to matter to me
if I'm dead? Follow me?

659
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:53,929
The cure can save millions. You're gonna
die anyway if we don't get it out.

660
00:59:56,667 --> 01:00:01,627
All I know is that whatever's
in my head is worth a lot of money.

661
01:00:01,706 --> 01:00:03,196
Why should I trust you?

662
01:00:03,274 --> 01:00:05,742
You're supposed to be my bodyguard.

663
01:00:07,178 --> 01:00:08,110
Bodyguard!

664
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:10,773
You're not walking out
with that cure in your head!

665
01:00:15,219 --> 01:00:17,380
That cure is mine!

666
01:00:21,459 --> 01:00:23,154
Behold your savior!

667
01:00:40,478 --> 01:00:42,969
Get out ot the building!
It's your only chance!

668
01:00:43,748 --> 01:00:45,773
Go! Get him to Jones!

669
01:00:47,885 --> 01:00:49,318
Go!

670
01:00:52,957 --> 01:00:54,891
Who is Jones?

671
01:00:54,959 --> 01:00:58,395
He's that guy
who fucks your mother.

672
01:01:10,908 --> 01:01:12,569
Where are they?

673
01:01:27,291 --> 01:01:29,452
I couldn't make the meeting,
but I'm still up for it.

674
01:01:29,527 --> 01:01:32,758
- Are you?
- Certainly.

675
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:36,596
This time: on the bridge,
landfill five.

676
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:39,067
Bring the rest of the code.
I'll find you.

677
01:01:39,136 --> 01:01:40,728
I'll be there.

678
01:01:40,805 --> 01:01:42,966
I want to negotiate.

679
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,304
Yes, sir.

680
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:49,479
Great. If they don't kill you,
J-Bone will.

681
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:59,215
Listen to me before it's too late.

682
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:02,191
We're running out of time.
He's carrying the cure for--

683
01:02:39,563 --> 01:02:42,464
I told her
if she wants to get with me...

684
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:44,501
then I want to get with her.

685
01:02:44,568 --> 01:02:47,935
Screw the physical disability.

686
01:02:48,005 --> 01:02:50,030
Because it's about the feeling.

687
01:02:51,842 --> 01:02:53,332
What's up?

688
01:02:54,412 --> 01:02:56,403
Wind, maybe.

689
01:03:05,022 --> 01:03:06,319
What do you think?

690
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:08,722
It's crazy,
but if I really have the cure...

691
01:03:08,793 --> 01:03:11,057
it could save you.

692
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,597
It could save everybody.

693
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:26,335
Who is this Jones guy
Spider said was our only chance?

694
01:03:27,712 --> 01:03:29,145
He's--

695
01:03:31,615 --> 01:03:33,242
He was in the navy.

696
01:03:33,317 --> 01:03:34,614
In the war.

697
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:37,552
They put a lot ot stuff in his head.
Kind of like you.

698
01:03:37,621 --> 01:03:39,646
Memory augments?

699
01:03:39,724 --> 01:03:41,658
I don't know.

700
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,552
You'll see.

701
01:03:50,801 --> 01:03:54,567
Man, somebody crazy down there
is getting on my nerves.

702
01:03:54,638 --> 01:03:57,903
Ratlands are full of crazies, Stick.
Ignore it, man.

703
01:03:59,543 --> 01:04:01,272
No, man.

704
01:04:02,246 --> 01:04:03,406
Down there.

705
01:04:03,481 --> 01:04:05,881
It's Spider's van.

706
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:09,044
Yep. Better tell J-Bone.

707
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,281
I got an idea.

708
01:04:11,355 --> 01:04:13,846
Let's drop a bug on Spider man.

709
01:04:13,924 --> 01:04:16,085
Forget it.

710
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,388
I'm going to do it.

711
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:20,328
Don't say that.
J-Bone'll shit if he hears you.

712
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:21,558
I'm going to do it.

713
01:04:21,632 --> 01:04:24,567
Wake up, damn it!

714
01:04:24,635 --> 01:04:27,263
- Shit, man.
- That's what they're for.

715
01:04:34,111 --> 01:04:35,305
Shit!

716
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:52,995
What the fuck is going on?

717
01:05:00,304 --> 01:05:04,741
You know, all my life...

718
01:05:04,809 --> 01:05:08,643
I've been caretul to
stay in my own corner.

719
01:05:08,712 --> 01:05:10,145
Looking out for number one.

720
01:05:10,214 --> 01:05:12,580
No complications.

721
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:15,843
Now suddenly...

722
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,583
I'm responsible
for the entire fucking world!

723
01:05:19,657 --> 01:05:22,490
Everybody and his mother
is trying to kill me...

724
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:26,052
if my head doesn't blow up first.

725
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:28,826
Maybe it's not just about you anymore.

726
01:05:31,735 --> 01:05:34,533
Listen. You listen to me.

727
01:05:35,673 --> 01:05:38,335
You see that city over there?

728
01:05:38,409 --> 01:05:41,037
That's where I'm supposed to be.

729
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:43,443
Not down here with the dogs
and the garbage...

730
01:05:43,514 --> 01:05:47,348
and the fucking last month's newspapers
blowing back and forth!

731
01:05:48,185 --> 01:05:50,517
I've had it with them!

732
01:05:50,588 --> 01:05:53,955
I've had it with you and all this!

733
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:59,956
I want room service!

734
01:06:02,766 --> 01:06:06,634
I want the club sandwich
and the cold Mexican beer.

735
01:06:06,704 --> 01:06:09,264
I want a $10,000-a-night hooker!

736
01:06:16,046 --> 01:06:17,980
I want my shirts laundered...

737
01:06:20,751 --> 01:06:25,120
like they do at the Imperial Hotel...

738
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:29,448
in Tokyo.

739
01:07:11,135 --> 01:07:13,000
We've got to see Jones.

740
01:07:14,138 --> 01:07:15,799
Spider sent us.

741
01:07:15,873 --> 01:07:18,364
Where's Spider?

742
01:07:18,442 --> 01:07:19,875
He's dead.

743
01:07:20,778 --> 01:07:22,871
Not in there. Earlier.

744
01:07:22,947 --> 01:07:24,471
At the hospital.

745
01:07:29,453 --> 01:07:31,387
If Spider sent you, come on.

746
01:07:38,829 --> 01:07:40,194
J-Bone, help me.

747
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:42,164
Come on.
Keep it together.

748
01:07:45,035 --> 01:07:46,468
Come on.

749
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:09,085
Help. Right here. You too.

750
01:08:12,229 --> 01:08:13,696
I got him!

751
01:08:15,733 --> 01:08:18,224
He'll be all right.
Go on.

752
01:08:49,066 --> 01:08:51,261
Tell Shinji to meet me at the bridge.

753
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:53,098
He's on his way, sir.

754
01:08:54,438 --> 01:08:56,770
- My helicopter.
- It's waiting, sir.

755
01:09:26,503 --> 01:09:27,435
You okay?

756
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:30,973
I saw--

757
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:32,338
I almost saw--

758
01:09:33,977 --> 01:09:35,911
As if it was...

759
01:09:37,581 --> 01:09:39,173
a memory.

760
01:09:51,428 --> 01:09:54,124
We have a room especially for that.

761
01:09:55,999 --> 01:09:57,933
It's time to meet Jones.

762
01:10:09,446 --> 01:10:12,677
We built Heaven completely
out of straight-world junk...

763
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,718
all hauled up here piece by piece.

764
01:10:16,019 --> 01:10:17,748
We work for Spider and his people...

765
01:10:17,821 --> 01:10:20,517
and anybody else
who is fighting the system.

766
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:22,525
We out shit for them.

767
01:10:23,527 --> 01:10:25,552
What do you mean, "out"?

768
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:35,336
Heaven.

769
01:10:35,405 --> 01:10:37,396
The heart and soul.

770
01:10:47,584 --> 01:10:49,347
This is where we fight back.

771
01:10:49,419 --> 01:10:52,650
We strip the pictures
from their 500-channel universe.

772
01:10:52,723 --> 01:10:55,419
Recontextualize it.
Then we spit the shit back at them.

773
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,925
Special data.

774
01:10:57,995 --> 01:10:59,019
Things that'll help people...

775
01:10:59,096 --> 01:11:01,360
like stuff we get from Spider.

776
01:11:01,431 --> 01:11:03,296
We wide-band it.

777
01:11:03,367 --> 01:11:05,801
Broadcast it. Go global.

778
01:11:05,869 --> 01:11:08,929
Bounce it off the satellites
that Jones hacks for us.

779
01:11:09,006 --> 01:11:10,337
Way the navy got him hooked up...

780
01:11:10,407 --> 01:11:13,308
he cuts through hard encryption
like a knife through butter.

781
01:11:13,377 --> 01:11:16,471
Code breaker.
I can't wait to meet him.

782
01:11:16,547 --> 01:11:18,105
Right this way.

783
01:11:22,953 --> 01:11:24,386
Jones.

784
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:31,452
It's a fish.

785
01:11:35,632 --> 01:11:36,621
It's a mammal.

786
01:11:39,236 --> 01:11:41,602
He's a friend, sailor.

787
01:11:44,141 --> 01:11:46,507
This was Spider's best bet?

788
01:11:46,577 --> 01:11:50,445
One thing Spider wasn't was stupid.

789
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:54,382
Jones is set up to sample software
from enemy subs.

790
01:11:54,451 --> 01:11:56,612
Intra-sound scan.

791
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,552
Right through the hull.

792
01:12:33,624 --> 01:12:36,092
Jones'll feed you can opener codes.

793
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:37,649
We'll try to get you out in time.

794
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:40,595
Wait. Have you done this before?

795
01:12:40,664 --> 01:12:43,155
Has the fish?

796
01:12:45,469 --> 01:12:46,766
How dangerous is this?

797
01:12:46,837 --> 01:12:48,771
Just keep your head still.

798
01:12:48,839 --> 01:12:50,773
Move around too much...

799
01:12:50,841 --> 01:12:52,672
could microwave your frontal lobe.

800
01:12:56,813 --> 01:12:58,110
Forget it.

801
01:12:58,181 --> 01:13:02,174
Look, man, at least you got a chance.

802
01:13:02,252 --> 01:13:04,720
It's up to you.

803
01:13:04,788 --> 01:13:06,722
Do what you got to do.

804
01:13:20,237 --> 01:13:22,171
Give me what you got
of the download codes.

805
01:14:04,348 --> 01:14:06,407
Inputting first image.

806
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:08,542
Set up the broadcast antennas.

807
01:14:27,437 --> 01:14:28,665
Now.

808
01:14:45,555 --> 01:14:48,217
It wasn't my fault.

809
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:49,656
We were just fooling around.

810
01:14:49,726 --> 01:14:52,786
I just don't want to do nothing no more.

811
01:14:54,564 --> 01:14:56,555
Hear what I'm saying?

812
01:14:56,633 --> 01:14:57,930
Hey, buddy.

813
01:15:17,154 --> 01:15:18,587
Maroni!

814
01:15:32,235 --> 01:15:33,668
Motherfuckers!

815
01:15:41,211 --> 01:15:43,042
Stations! You all know the dril!

816
01:16:01,398 --> 01:16:03,332
- What did you get?
- We didn't.

817
01:16:05,302 --> 01:16:06,997
We're not going to get it right now.

818
01:16:08,772 --> 01:16:12,606
The only way is to hack your own brain
and loop it through Jones.

819
01:16:12,676 --> 01:16:14,473
The fuel tanks!

820
01:16:16,546 --> 01:16:18,104
Shit. It's the Yakuza.

821
01:16:19,649 --> 01:16:20,980
Give me that.

822
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:55,545
I was almost there.

823
01:16:55,619 --> 01:16:58,179
I could feel it starting to--

824
01:17:05,028 --> 01:17:06,962
Mr. Smith?

825
01:17:08,365 --> 01:17:09,798
PharmaKom?

826
01:17:11,701 --> 01:17:13,134
Not really.

827
01:17:21,711 --> 01:17:23,269
You can't shoot me.

828
01:17:24,814 --> 01:17:26,782
Not in the head.

829
01:17:39,629 --> 01:17:41,722
Takahashi!

830
01:17:41,798 --> 01:17:44,767
Do you know what
he is carrying in his head?

831
01:17:44,834 --> 01:17:48,895
He's carrying the cure for NAS.

832
01:17:48,972 --> 01:17:53,432
Your daughter died to protect
PharmaKom's profit margin.

833
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:58,106
Treating the disease is far more
profitable than curing it.

834
01:17:58,181 --> 01:17:59,773
They had the cure...

835
01:17:59,849 --> 01:18:01,680
eight months ago, Takahashi.

836
01:18:01,751 --> 01:18:06,188
PharmaKom, the company that I created...

837
01:18:06,256 --> 01:18:08,622
let your daughter die.

838
01:18:28,011 --> 01:18:29,501
Shinji.

839
01:18:34,184 --> 01:18:35,617
Hello, Johnny.

840
01:18:44,327 --> 01:18:45,988
Raise your chin.

841
01:18:46,062 --> 01:18:47,996
Let's make this clean.

842
01:19:48,124 --> 01:19:49,352
Kiai!

843
01:20:06,409 --> 01:20:08,502
If I fall, you don't get the head.

844
01:20:08,578 --> 01:20:10,944
If you lose the head,
you're fucked!

845
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:07,669
Jesus time.

846
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:18,600
Come to Jesus.

847
01:22:32,388 --> 01:22:33,616
The cure.

848
01:22:39,929 --> 01:22:44,366
He's made you the vessel of His mercy
as I am the vessel of His wrath.

849
01:22:45,568 --> 01:22:46,592
Jones.

850
01:22:51,741 --> 01:22:53,572
What spawn of Satan--

851
01:22:57,413 --> 01:22:58,277
Now!

852
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:48,758
Jane!

853
01:23:56,906 --> 01:23:58,032
I'm all right.

854
01:24:09,819 --> 01:24:11,309
Piece ot shit.

855
01:24:12,388 --> 01:24:13,912
Hook me up.

856
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:15,787
The second image.

857
01:24:18,127 --> 01:24:19,822
Get the power up!

858
01:24:38,648 --> 01:24:39,740
Johnny.

859
01:24:41,651 --> 01:24:44,711
The dolphin can take you into the data.

860
01:24:44,787 --> 01:24:46,812
Find the third image.

861
01:24:48,758 --> 01:24:51,625
I knew their secrets.

862
01:24:51,694 --> 01:24:54,254
The image...

863
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:58,027
the company has forgotten for me.

864
01:24:58,101 --> 01:25:00,535
Now they erase me...

865
01:25:00,603 --> 01:25:02,867
burn me out of the mainframes.

866
01:25:02,939 --> 01:25:06,340
One memory after another.

867
01:25:06,409 --> 01:25:09,936
How very kind of them.

868
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:11,904
Johnny.

869
01:25:16,619 --> 01:25:20,055
We're out of power,
so we have to do the download now.

870
01:25:27,063 --> 01:25:30,032
Remember, we've got to
loop it through Jones.

871
01:25:33,336 --> 01:25:34,963
Okay, let's do this.

872
01:25:35,038 --> 01:25:36,869
Watch your ass, man.

873
01:25:36,939 --> 01:25:40,397
No telling what defenses
PharmaKom stuck in there.

874
01:25:40,476 --> 01:25:42,467
Probably got virus programs.

875
01:25:42,545 --> 01:25:44,604
You ready?

876
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:46,148
Loop it.

877
01:26:07,937 --> 01:26:09,404
Listen up world.

878
01:26:09,472 --> 01:26:12,134
This is the last blast
from LoTek World Headuarters.

879
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:14,301
And believe this:
We're going out with a bang, baby.

880
01:26:14,377 --> 01:26:16,868
So get your CRs ready,
'cause we got what you need.

881
01:26:16,946 --> 01:26:19,312
We got the cure to NAS.

882
01:26:19,382 --> 01:26:21,509
That's right.
The cure to the black shakes.

883
01:26:21,584 --> 01:26:24,178
It's coming to you live
from the labs up at PharmaKom.

884
01:26:24,253 --> 01:26:27,689
And believe this: They did not want you
to get this information.

885
01:26:27,757 --> 01:26:30,487
So here it is, coming at you,
LoTek style.

886
01:26:37,166 --> 01:26:38,599
Hit me.

887
01:26:48,177 --> 01:26:49,644
He's on his way in.

888
01:27:04,827 --> 01:27:07,057
Anauthorized interface attempt.

889
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:13,894
Intruder alert.

890
01:27:23,212 --> 01:27:25,510
Final warning.

891
01:27:25,581 --> 01:27:27,981
Initiating virus program.

892
01:27:37,727 --> 01:27:39,251
He's doubling himself.

893
01:27:43,332 --> 01:27:44,765
Launching virus.

894
01:27:55,044 --> 01:27:56,705
That's the double. Don't worry.

895
01:28:06,789 --> 01:28:08,654
The only way is to hack your own brain.

896
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:22,194
Loop it.

897
01:28:40,923 --> 01:28:42,857
Get ready.

898
01:28:42,925 --> 01:28:44,153
Send it out.

899
01:28:51,567 --> 01:28:52,761
Initiating download.

900
01:30:13,616 --> 01:30:16,084
Happy birthday, Johnny.

901
01:30:17,186 --> 01:30:18,983
Thank you, Mommy.

902
01:31:18,147 --> 01:31:20,081
It's payback time.

903
01:31:37,266 --> 01:31:39,257
Just garbage.

904
01:31:39,335 --> 01:31:41,269
Get that out of here!
