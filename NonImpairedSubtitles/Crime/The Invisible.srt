1
00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:59,343
It wasn't easy...

2
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:02,410
...when Nick's father died,

3
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:05,354
raising a teenager alone.

4
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:07,324
But, with a boy like Nick,

5
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:11,089
well, he is... now...

6
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:13,154
...everything a mother could want.

7
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:17,229
We've been through some hard times.

8
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:20,203
We've carried each other.

9
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:22,638
Now I look to the future,

10
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:27,236
and I know there's nothing
that we can't do together.

11
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:30,541
Thank you.

12
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:32,549
Go on, open it.

13
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:40,016
Turn it over.

14
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:42,424
"To Nick, from Mother.
Make me proud."

15
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:47,860
So, to us.

16
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,560
To us, all.

17
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:52,068
Cheers.

18
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:54,230
Around the table.

19
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,490
You look pale.

20
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:44,560
How would you know?

21
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:48,160
Are you taking the Valerian Root
I got you?

22
00:04:50,105 --> 00:04:53,165
- Mom...
- Finals are next week.

23
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:55,436
Mom?

24
00:04:57,345 --> 00:04:58,642
What?

25
00:04:58,713 --> 00:05:02,171
Have you... thought about it?

26
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,549
- About what?
- The writer's course?

27
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,555
- London?
- I don't need to think about it.

28
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:12,320
You know how I feel.
Why do we keep bringing this up?

29
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:16,296
What is that?

30
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:20,428
Irony?

31
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:49,223
What's up, dude?

32
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:50,992
You got it?

33
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,095
Thanks, man.
You just saved my ass.

34
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:59,629
Pleasure doing business with you.

35
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,972
You want to know what it says?

36
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:04,443
When am I going to speak French?

37
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:07,078
Hey, caught you.

38
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:11,485
Are you coming to
Ava's party tomorrow?

39
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:13,783
I can't. I'm busy.

40
00:06:13,855 --> 00:06:17,222
Busy? School's almost out.

41
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:18,520
Whatever.

42
00:06:19,394 --> 00:06:21,385
Come on.

43
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:25,194
- What's he got?
- Nothing.

44
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:31,504
Not a dime.

45
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:35,369
Unbelievable.

46
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:45,846
Nic gum.

47
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:50,384
And a pack.

48
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,052
You wearing the patch, too?

49
00:06:53,995 --> 00:06:56,259
Kind of a mixed message, Pete.

50
00:06:56,331 --> 00:07:00,097
Like the fact that you
accepted merchandise from me...

51
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:02,534
...and still haven't
paid for it.

52
00:07:02,604 --> 00:07:04,299
I'll get your money, please!

53
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:06,704
Got money for this crap,
but not for me?

54
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:09,266
No, please!
I'll get your money! Please!

55
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:14,105
Don't be such a baby.
It's just a scratch.

56
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:16,150
See you soon.

57
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:23,084
"She sits up and cries

58
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:27,853
A sigh

59
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:31,296
Long thighs

60
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:34,428
Gotta fly

61
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:37,869
Love you, baby
A lie

62
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:40,464
Why?"

63
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,635
Jimmy, you wrote that?

64
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:45,578
Yes, ma'am.

65
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:48,013
OK, then. Thanks.

66
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:54,349
Nicholas, let's see
if you can top that.

67
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:55,889
Please.

68
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:58,016
It still needs some work.

69
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:00,459
It always needs work, get used to it.

70
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:15,543
"Day burns down to night

71
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,670
Burns the edge of my soul

72
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:20,647
In the night

73
00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:23,741
I break into sparks of suns

74
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:27,584
And become fire's end
The dust of bones

75
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:31,682
Night knifes my breath
Swallows whole my tongue

76
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,354
Turn back reverse return

77
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:38,391
In the night I see the real

78
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:40,991
Concealed in the day's bright lie

79
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:43,561
Eyes stitched shut

80
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:46,266
White teeth smile

81
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:48,366
Sleep walks

82
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:51,378
And talks and feet mark time..."

83
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:56,150
OK, I know it's party week,

84
00:08:56,217 --> 00:08:58,913
but it's finals, too.

85
00:09:06,494 --> 00:09:07,791
Hey.

86
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,326
Hey. Don't look at me like that.
I needed a new phone.

87
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:17,871
So go buy one at RadioShack.

88
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:19,668
Are you serious?
You know my dad.

89
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:22,733
- He gives me no cash.
- You gotta stand up for yourself, man.

90
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:25,644
Don't let them push you
around like that.

91
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:27,112
That's easy for you to say,

92
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:29,514
because when you talk, people listen.

93
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:32,781
When I talk, you listen.
That's about it.

94
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:42,824
I can't, man. OK? I can't.

95
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:45,092
Hey, Nick, come on.
Dude, stop it, stop.

96
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,566
Come on, Nick.

97
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:49,899
Damn it.

98
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:57,100
OK...

99
00:09:57,178 --> 00:09:59,078
How much does
my friend owe you?

100
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:08,945
Is that enough?

101
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,218
Disappear, asshole.

102
00:10:15,964 --> 00:10:19,730
You are so broken.

103
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,486
What are you looking at?

104
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,290
No. Nothing. I'm just...

105
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:52,026
...more of a Grover guy, that's all.

106
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:01,106
You're so polite.

107
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:03,666
The whole "golden boy" thing, right?

108
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:07,704
Except it's not really you.
I mean, I know you sell essays.

109
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:12,286
You're no better than me.

110
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:16,119
You're right.
I'm a total hypocrite.

111
00:11:23,564 --> 00:11:25,225
Anybody want to explain?

112
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:28,728
She...

113
00:11:28,803 --> 00:11:31,294
...finds me irresistible.

114
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:38,075
All right. Newton, I'm not gonna
suspend you. I know the game.

115
00:11:38,146 --> 00:11:40,808
Just go home today,
be back here tomorrow.

116
00:11:40,882 --> 00:11:42,782
Try decaf.

117
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,752
What are you doing, Nick?

118
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:56,263
Wasting your time on
a lost soul like Annie Newton?

119
00:11:56,331 --> 00:12:00,062
She has no future.
You do.

120
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:02,364
Don't let us down.

121
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:03,995
Can I leave now?

122
00:12:10,178 --> 00:12:12,646
Hey, Annie.

123
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:20,111
Where's dinner?

124
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:22,156
Hey, Victor. Are you hungry?

125
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:26,120
See?

126
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:33,297
Get your bony ass out of this chair
right now and make him something to eat.

127
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:37,267
You can't talk to me like that.

128
00:12:37,338 --> 00:12:39,272
I just did.

129
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,173
- Just gonna leave?
- What do you want? I got night shift.

130
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:43,574
Say something to her.

131
00:12:43,644 --> 00:12:46,340
It's a little food. You got
nothing else to do all day.

132
00:12:46,414 --> 00:12:49,008
You wanna fight, then?
Is that what you want to do?

133
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,983
- Yeah.
- You wanna get into this now?

134
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:53,145
Discipline your kids, for God's sake.

135
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:54,654
You don't tell me what to do.

136
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:56,986
Take some responsibility
for your kids.

137
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:59,458
Why won't you talk to her?

138
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:02,052
My main responsibility...

139
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,600
Annie, you going out tonight?

140
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:11,069
Annie? Annie!

141
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,771
You're leaving?

142
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:18,042
Later. I'll be back.

143
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:23,378
I'll be back.

144
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:39,195
Hey.

145
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:47,006
It's from Seb and Tash.

146
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:50,169
They need those...
translations by tomorrow morning.

147
00:13:50,244 --> 00:13:52,212
Yeah, they're done.

148
00:13:56,417 --> 00:14:00,854
- So, you got beat up by a girl.
- Yeah, I don't want to talk about it.

149
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:03,652
Yeah, don't want to talk about it, huh?

150
00:14:03,724 --> 00:14:06,420
So, are we gonna go to Ava's
party tomorrow night?

151
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:10,020
Party.

152
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:14,797
I'm not gonna be here
tomorrow night.

153
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:23,572
Ticket and baggage information.

154
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,611
- London?
- Yeah.

155
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:32,585
The Royal Academy
writer's program.

156
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:34,518
Really?

157
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:37,080
No, you're graduating next week,
you can't go.

158
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:40,286
- I have enough credits to graduate.
- Oh, my God.

159
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:45,321
London?

160
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,259
- London?
- Yeah.

161
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:50,736
- Wait, does your mom know?
- No.

162
00:14:51,906 --> 00:14:53,965
But she will, when I'm gone.

163
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,670
She just... she won't get it.
You know, she doesn't get it.

164
00:14:57,745 --> 00:15:00,077
- Yeah.
- There's no other way.

165
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:02,776
Do you remember
when my dad died?

166
00:15:03,784 --> 00:15:07,117
The first thing that
she said to me was,

167
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:10,624
"Don't worry about it, Nick.
This won't change a thing for you."

168
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:13,751
You know, I'm like, 13, right.
All I wanna do is cry.

169
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:16,262
She's thinking about my future?

170
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,821
She's always had it mapped out.

171
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,859
You know, I stay here,
I might as well retire and die.

172
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:24,996
I mean, my dad
didn't even get to retire.

173
00:15:25,072 --> 00:15:27,199
He was 46 when he got sick.

174
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:30,574
I'm not gonna let her do that to me.

175
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:43,714
Hey, baby girl.

176
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,315
You ready?

177
00:15:45,393 --> 00:15:46,951
Always.

178
00:15:57,338 --> 00:15:59,135
Hey...

179
00:15:59,207 --> 00:16:02,074
Hey! Don't even
think about it, all right?

180
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:05,704
They're still inside, that's why
they haven't cleared the window.

181
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:18,281
Hey... hey, what the hell
are you doing?

182
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:20,621
No, no. Annie, no!

183
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:24,692
Goddamn it, Annie!

184
00:16:29,804 --> 00:16:31,465
Goddamn it.

185
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:35,073
Whoo!

186
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,407
Whoo!

187
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:42,581
Yeah, nice work, Annie.

188
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,242
Jesus Christ.

189
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:47,344
You just invited the cops
to a fuckin' auto theft!

190
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:48,615
Fuckin' retard!

191
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:51,283
You always expect me
to just stand around?

192
00:17:09,844 --> 00:17:12,210
You're getting more
and more out of control.

193
00:17:30,464 --> 00:17:33,262
- What time is it?
- Go back to sleep.

194
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:36,792
- Leave the bag. I'll take care of it.
- Sure you will.

195
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:40,034
You gonna shop it around at school?
It's not like cell phones.

196
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:42,405
What, I can't make
a little money on the side?

197
00:17:42,476 --> 00:17:44,740
What for? College?

198
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:49,742
I'll figure it out.

199
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:51,682
Leave the bag.

200
00:17:51,752 --> 00:17:54,516
- What are you gonna do, Marcus?
- Leave the bag, Annie.

201
00:17:55,623 --> 00:17:58,114
Nothing.

202
00:17:58,192 --> 00:17:59,386
Nothing?

203
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:02,922
Hey, I'm talking to you.

204
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:05,989
Don't walk away from me
when I'm talking to you!

205
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:07,762
Nothing?

206
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:14,607
Nothing.

207
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,410
<i>Police Department.</i>
<i>Can I help you?</i>

208
00:20:07,388 --> 00:20:10,323
Marcus? Marcus!

209
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,560
- Marcus.
- They found the stuff. I got busted.

210
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:26,402
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing. You think I'm an idiot?

211
00:20:26,474 --> 00:20:28,942
Police Department.
How may I direct your call?

212
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:31,876
I'm out on OR. I got
a court date in a couple weeks.

213
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:35,848
- Any idea how they found out?
- Yeah. An idea.

214
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,578
<i>I'll take care of it myself.</i>

215
00:20:49,396 --> 00:20:51,261
- Hey, Nick?
- Yeah?

216
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:56,196
- I wanna leave, too, man.
- Why?

217
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,137
Why? Why?

218
00:20:59,206 --> 00:21:02,698
'Cause I'd be the foreigner.
I'd be American, I have the accent.

219
00:21:02,776 --> 00:21:04,505
What are you gonna do in London?

220
00:21:04,578 --> 00:21:07,672
I'll be a cricket star.
You know, those dudes with mallets?

221
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:13,511
- I think that's polo.
- I'd be a polo star.

222
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:17,683
You didn't have money to afford a cell
phone, how are you gonna get a ticket?

223
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:22,992
- You have a passport?
- No.

224
00:21:24,198 --> 00:21:26,632
I need someone to write to, man.

225
00:21:29,136 --> 00:21:31,297
OK. All right. Good luck.

226
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:33,465
I love you, man.

227
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,566
I love you, too.

228
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:37,406
Take care of yourself, man.

229
00:21:37,478 --> 00:21:40,106
- Don't look back, baby.
- Don't look back.

230
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,019
The airline called.

231
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:53,423
Your flight's been changed.

232
00:21:53,494 --> 00:21:55,587
- I can explain, Mom.
- Can you?

233
00:21:57,164 --> 00:21:58,893
Can you, really?

234
00:22:00,868 --> 00:22:03,837
- I tried to talk to you.
- Why bother?

235
00:22:03,904 --> 00:22:07,101
You've had this ticket for weeks.

236
00:22:07,174 --> 00:22:10,007
You were planning to go
no matter what I said.

237
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,781
My God, Nicholas.

238
00:22:17,851 --> 00:22:21,446
You were just going to leave
tonight without saying a word?

239
00:22:25,326 --> 00:22:28,955
I feel like I've been living
in this house with a stranger.

240
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:33,088
I swear I didn't do it, OK?

241
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,253
You were watching me.

242
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:36,956
It wasn't me.

243
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:38,965
You were watching me
by the lockers.

244
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:40,591
- I didn't do it.
- Then who did?

245
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:43,933
I don't know, I swear,
I don't know!

246
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:46,234
Please stop!

247
00:23:49,376 --> 00:23:50,934
No, no!

248
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:53,002
- Get back here.
- No! No! Don't!

249
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,708
How's your hand, Pete?
How's your hand, Pete!

250
00:23:55,783 --> 00:23:57,148
Huh?

251
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:00,884
OK!

252
00:24:00,954 --> 00:24:02,979
I'll tell you, OK?

253
00:24:03,057 --> 00:24:05,287
I'll tell you!

254
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,442
Thought you were
too busy to come.

255
00:24:30,918 --> 00:24:33,386
You wanna go to London?

256
00:24:34,755 --> 00:24:37,690
You wanna go to London?

257
00:24:38,525 --> 00:24:40,857
Seriously.

258
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:48,557
Flight leaves in two hours.

259
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:50,626
Then we'd better hurry up.

260
00:24:59,613 --> 00:25:03,014
What would she think of us right now?

261
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,914
Your mom.

262
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,482
Hmm?

263
00:25:09,556 --> 00:25:10,648
Wow.

264
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:15,522
That's a nice watch.

265
00:25:18,966 --> 00:25:22,094
So why are you still wearing
that beat up, old thing?

266
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,235
My dad gave it to me.

267
00:25:28,308 --> 00:25:31,641
Wouldn't he want you
to have a better watch?

268
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:34,408
It was my dad's.

269
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,249
What are you doing?

270
00:25:51,632 --> 00:25:54,066
Have a good time.

271
00:27:03,637 --> 00:27:04,797
Hey, where you off to?

272
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,639
Come on, man.
You gonna fight back?

273
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:17,513
I can't watch this.

274
00:27:17,584 --> 00:27:20,781
Please, tell them to stop.

275
00:27:20,854 --> 00:27:24,847
- Shut up.
- Please, tell them to stop.

276
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:27,792
Please, tell them to stop.

277
00:27:30,597 --> 00:27:32,792
Think you're so smart?

278
00:27:32,866 --> 00:27:35,835
Gonna cry? Why don't you cry?

279
00:27:35,903 --> 00:27:39,168
Come on, you little baby.
Look at me!

280
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,433
Get the hell up!

281
00:27:40,507 --> 00:27:41,974
Come on, man. Fight back.

282
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:43,236
Get off.

283
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:47,573
No.

284
00:27:53,387 --> 00:27:55,116
- How do you like that?
- Stop it!

285
00:27:55,188 --> 00:27:59,284
Do you feel good about yourself now?
Now that you turned me in, huh?

286
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:02,453
I didn't know... You were
supposed to be on a plane, Nick!

287
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:04,588
He can't hear you, idiot.

288
00:28:08,035 --> 00:28:10,663
You're so damn perfect.

289
00:28:10,737 --> 00:28:13,001
Annie, Annie.
That's enough. Look at him.

290
00:28:13,073 --> 00:28:15,564
- Stop. Just stop.
- Get off of me!

291
00:28:15,642 --> 00:28:19,373
- Who's the broken one, now?
- You are.

292
00:28:19,446 --> 00:28:21,505
It's still you.

293
00:28:22,883 --> 00:28:24,783
Come on, come on.

294
00:28:25,686 --> 00:28:27,347
Still you.

295
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,284
- What'd you say?
- Still you.

296
00:28:48,575 --> 00:28:49,633
What'd you...?

297
00:28:51,244 --> 00:28:52,768
Oh, jeez.

298
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,278
- He's not breathing.
- Aw, man!

299
00:28:58,352 --> 00:29:03,153
What the hell, Annie!
What did you do that for?

300
00:29:04,524 --> 00:29:07,584
- What did you do? What did you do?
- Shut up. Shut up!

301
00:29:07,661 --> 00:29:10,152
- What did you do?
- I am not going to jail for this!

302
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:15,662
- Oh!
- Now we have to pick him up.

303
00:29:15,736 --> 00:29:18,068
- I'm not picking him up.
- Pick him up!

304
00:29:24,745 --> 00:29:26,872
Just keep moving.

305
00:29:26,947 --> 00:29:28,778
We gotta get further into the woods.

306
00:29:28,849 --> 00:29:31,181
- We know, we got it!
- Just come.

307
00:29:32,252 --> 00:29:33,913
Just keep moving.

308
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:49,229
Come on, get in here.

309
00:30:33,847 --> 00:30:35,872
Open up.

310
00:30:39,986 --> 00:30:42,955
- Open up!
- Oh, Christ.

311
00:30:46,226 --> 00:30:48,353
What the hell
happened to you?

312
00:30:48,428 --> 00:30:50,658
I killed him.

313
00:30:58,305 --> 00:31:01,069
What did you say?

314
00:31:01,141 --> 00:31:04,736
- I killed him.
- Killed who?

315
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,071
Nicholas Powell,
the kid who sold me out.

316
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:12,710
It got all screwed up.
What am I gonna do?

317
00:31:16,189 --> 00:31:18,589
Why the hell did you
come here, Annie?

318
00:31:18,658 --> 00:31:22,458
Jesus Christ!
You know I'm on parole, Annie!

319
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:24,656
Why'd you come here?

320
00:31:24,731 --> 00:31:26,358
I need an alibi, Marcus.

321
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:36,237
What did I say to you, huh?

322
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:37,867
You're way out of control.

323
00:31:37,944 --> 00:31:40,105
You should've listened to me.
Now get out.

324
00:31:41,515 --> 00:31:44,143
Get out!

325
00:31:46,987 --> 00:31:49,182
Don't touch that.

326
00:31:49,256 --> 00:31:50,985
Stolen.

327
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:55,355
Stolen...

328
00:31:55,428 --> 00:31:59,865
...stolen, stolen, stolen.

329
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:03,664
Stolen, stolen...

330
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:05,568
...stolen!

331
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:11,903
I knew I could count on you.

332
00:33:42,836 --> 00:33:44,861
Guess you didn't
use the ticket, huh?

333
00:33:44,938 --> 00:33:47,168
I don't even know
where he went.

334
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,607
See, they return.

335
00:33:50,677 --> 00:33:54,841
Ah, see the tentative movements
and the slow feet

336
00:33:54,914 --> 00:33:58,213
Trouble in the pace
and the uncertain wavering

337
00:33:58,285 --> 00:34:00,583
Anyone?

338
00:34:00,654 --> 00:34:04,146
Come on, guys.
We did this poem three days ago.

339
00:34:04,224 --> 00:34:06,556
- Ezra Pound?
- No one?

340
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:08,992
Hello?

341
00:34:09,062 --> 00:34:13,965
- It's Ezra Pound, <i>The Return.</i>
- No one?

342
00:34:14,034 --> 00:34:17,868
Ezra Pound. You guys
are killing me.

343
00:34:17,937 --> 00:34:19,768
OK. Discussion.

344
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,104
Poems we heard in last class.

345
00:34:25,211 --> 00:34:27,509
- Jimmy.
- Nick Powell's poem.

346
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:31,414
I mean, I didn't get it.
How does sleep talk?

347
00:34:31,484 --> 00:34:34,146
- It's a metaphor.
- It doesn't even rhyme.

348
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,450
- What's your problem?
- It's pretentious.

349
00:34:36,523 --> 00:34:39,321
Nick's always trying
to make himself important.

350
00:34:39,392 --> 00:34:41,189
I think Powell
has serious issues.

351
00:34:41,261 --> 00:34:44,492
- Whatever, it sucked.
- I liked it.

352
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:46,797
Is this a game?

353
00:34:46,866 --> 00:34:49,130
You guys playing a game?
Think this is funny?

354
00:34:49,202 --> 00:34:51,136
Hello!

355
00:34:51,204 --> 00:34:53,138
Anybody?

356
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,174
Hello!

357
00:34:56,242 --> 00:34:59,177
Hello! Hello!

358
00:34:59,245 --> 00:35:03,079
Hello? Hello!
Can anybody hear me?

359
00:35:14,594 --> 00:35:16,687
Hey, guys. Guys.

360
00:35:16,763 --> 00:35:20,756
Let's talk about this when Nick
gets back to class, shall we?

361
00:35:25,071 --> 00:35:26,936
Come on, Mom, answer the phone.

362
00:35:27,006 --> 00:35:28,735
Answer the phone.

363
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:32,839
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just had to use the phone.

364
00:35:34,714 --> 00:35:36,875
Hello?

365
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,713
Nicholas Powell?

366
00:35:38,785 --> 00:35:41,777
No, he must be in class right now,
Mrs. Powell.

367
00:35:41,855 --> 00:35:44,915
Yeah, just a minute.
I'll have someone go check if he's here.

368
00:35:44,991 --> 00:35:46,891
Hold on, please.

369
00:35:53,032 --> 00:35:55,296
<i>I'm sorry, detective, what was that?</i>

370
00:35:55,368 --> 00:36:00,169
- Mom... can you hear me?
- <i>He left the house last night at 7:00.</i>

371
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,868
<i>He's never stayed out</i>
<i>all night without calling me.</i>

372
00:36:02,942 --> 00:36:05,433
<i>I just...</i>
<i>I have a bad feeling about this.</i>

373
00:36:05,512 --> 00:36:06,604
Mom!

374
00:36:47,387 --> 00:36:48,877
Hello!

375
00:36:51,057 --> 00:36:52,888
Hello!

376
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:02,728
Hello!

377
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,639
Hello!

378
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,135
You saw me.

379
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,902
You were at the window

380
00:38:18,978 --> 00:38:20,912
and you saw me.

381
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,709
I need your help. Can you help me?

382
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:24,680
I know you can see me.

383
00:38:24,751 --> 00:38:27,185
You'll never be seen again.

384
00:38:29,055 --> 00:38:32,547
They... can't hear you anymore.

385
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:34,752
They can't touch you.

386
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:38,263
You don't exist.

387
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:43,166
No.

388
00:38:43,937 --> 00:38:46,929
No. No.

389
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,111
Hello, hello!

390
00:39:32,185 --> 00:39:34,016
- Hello?
- Oh, thank God.

391
00:39:34,087 --> 00:39:36,647
Is that better?
Can you hear me?

392
00:39:36,723 --> 00:39:40,022
I said 18 year old, white male,
name's Nicholas Powell.

393
00:39:40,093 --> 00:39:42,459
Possible missing persons case.

394
00:39:49,035 --> 00:39:52,198
What are you looking for, detective?

395
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:55,536
My son is missing
and you're in here.

396
00:39:55,608 --> 00:39:57,405
What exactly are you doing?

397
00:39:57,477 --> 00:39:59,570
Looking for anything to help find Nick.

398
00:39:59,646 --> 00:40:03,412
I mean, I could fill out a report,
give it 24 hours, but...

399
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:06,145
That's not what I do...

400
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:08,119
Not when a kid's involved.

401
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,659
I don't know.

402
00:40:19,732 --> 00:40:21,893
You know if Nick used drugs
or sold them?

403
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,129
No. Of course not.

404
00:40:26,205 --> 00:40:29,333
What can you tell me about him?

405
00:40:29,409 --> 00:40:32,810
He's very well liked.
He's bright. He's very bright.

406
00:40:32,879 --> 00:40:34,744
He's very bright.

407
00:40:34,814 --> 00:40:36,805
I mean, who is he, really?

408
00:40:38,551 --> 00:40:41,213
As a person?

409
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,081
You have my number
if there's anything.

410
00:40:48,628 --> 00:40:50,493
Detective?

411
00:40:50,563 --> 00:40:54,124
I found a plane ticket...
for London.

412
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,135
- Did you call the airline?
- He missed the flight.

413
00:40:57,203 --> 00:40:58,761
He wasn't on it.

414
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:00,863
I wouldn't worry too much,
Mrs. Powell.

415
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,204
He's only been gone the one night.

416
00:41:03,276 --> 00:41:06,336
No. Something is wrong.

417
00:41:06,412 --> 00:41:09,813
He... he wouldn't.
I know him.

418
00:41:10,717 --> 00:41:14,153
You didn't know
about the plane ticket.

419
00:41:17,724 --> 00:41:20,022
Mom. I'm dead.

420
00:43:33,593 --> 00:43:35,458
We need to get a search party up here.

421
00:43:35,528 --> 00:43:38,691
- Comb these woods.
- Yeah, I spoke with the principal.

422
00:43:38,764 --> 00:43:42,598
Nick had a run in yesterday
with a girl at school.

423
00:43:42,668 --> 00:43:45,637
Sorry. Newton.
Annie Newton.

424
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,640
Something I should know?

425
00:43:55,181 --> 00:43:57,172
Jack.

426
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:01,253
We're here to talk to Annie.

427
00:44:03,723 --> 00:44:05,520
She's on the roof.

428
00:44:09,528 --> 00:44:11,291
Some history there?

429
00:44:11,364 --> 00:44:13,491
He used to be a cop.

430
00:44:13,566 --> 00:44:14,931
What happened?

431
00:44:15,001 --> 00:44:17,026
It's a long story.

432
00:44:18,304 --> 00:44:21,637
I knew Annie when
she was just a baby.

433
00:44:21,707 --> 00:44:23,868
She liked my ties.

434
00:44:27,413 --> 00:44:29,074
Hey, kiddo. What's up?

435
00:44:30,616 --> 00:44:32,948
What do you want now?

436
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:37,217
Nice. You know,
you asked me to marry you once.

437
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:39,155
Another lifetime.

438
00:44:39,225 --> 00:44:41,523
I guess so.

439
00:44:46,499 --> 00:44:49,059
What did you do last night, Annie?

440
00:44:49,135 --> 00:44:52,161
- I don't remember.
- She was busy cracking my skull.

441
00:44:52,238 --> 00:44:54,172
Happen to run into Nicholas Powell?

442
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,674
- Who?
- Why not ask her why she killed me.

443
00:44:56,742 --> 00:44:59,370
- We know you had a problem with him.
- Do I know you?

444
00:44:59,445 --> 00:45:01,572
Someone called to
turn you in yesterday.

445
00:45:01,647 --> 00:45:04,946
You knew that.
Think it was Nicholas?

446
00:45:05,017 --> 00:45:07,611
- What?
- I was with my boyfriend, Marcus.

447
00:45:07,687 --> 00:45:09,245
- Marcus know this?
- Ask him.

448
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:15,354
They found something by the woods.
Putting together a search party, so...

449
00:45:15,428 --> 00:45:18,261
So... I have
some homework to do.

450
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:19,855
You'll have to excuse me.

451
00:45:19,932 --> 00:45:22,492
- I'll let you get to it.
- Mm-hmm.

452
00:45:25,972 --> 00:45:28,099
No more questions?
You bought that?

453
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,371
I can't believe this.

454
00:45:40,052 --> 00:45:44,148
You killed me because you thought
I called the police on you?

455
00:45:44,223 --> 00:45:46,987
- Was she a sweet baby?
- Everybody has a story.

456
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:48,822
You bitch!

457
00:46:04,877 --> 00:46:06,469
Be careful, you'll break it.

458
00:46:06,545 --> 00:46:09,742
- Why can't I fly it on the roof?
- Because it's not safe.

459
00:46:09,815 --> 00:46:13,182
- Don't pretend you're a human being.
- Come on, please.

460
00:46:13,252 --> 00:46:16,847
I'll take you to the park
sometime. The one by the bluffs?

461
00:46:16,922 --> 00:46:19,356
- When?
- Sometime.

462
00:46:19,425 --> 00:46:21,985
- I'm just a little busy right now.
- Hey, Annie.

463
00:46:22,061 --> 00:46:25,997
- What's gonna happen to you?
- Nothing to worry about, little man.

464
00:46:26,065 --> 00:46:29,330
Hey, Pete. There's a search party
in the woods. I want you there.

465
00:46:29,402 --> 00:46:30,767
I don't care.

466
00:46:31,604 --> 00:46:34,004
Oh, my God, this is a nightmare.

467
00:46:50,423 --> 00:46:51,651
Shit!

468
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:00,228
Go slowly, keep together,
pay attention.

469
00:47:00,299 --> 00:47:03,735
If you find something,
call one of the officers.

470
00:47:03,803 --> 00:47:05,600
Try not to disturb the area.

471
00:47:06,439 --> 00:47:08,771
OK. Let's get to it.

472
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,947
Set your radios
on channel three.

473
00:47:19,885 --> 00:47:22,945
- Tell them to go south.
- Nicholas!

474
00:47:23,022 --> 00:47:25,183
Nick!

475
00:47:26,892 --> 00:47:28,883
Nicholas!

476
00:47:31,864 --> 00:47:33,855
Nick Powell!

477
00:47:37,837 --> 00:47:39,771
Nick!

478
00:47:49,215 --> 00:47:51,843
Nick Powell!
Can you hear us?

479
00:47:52,585 --> 00:47:55,577
Nick!

480
00:48:42,001 --> 00:48:45,630
Day burns down to night

481
00:48:45,704 --> 00:48:48,730
Burns the edge of my soul

482
00:48:48,807 --> 00:48:52,299
In the night
I break into sparks of suns

483
00:48:52,378 --> 00:48:54,744
And become fire's end

484
00:48:54,813 --> 00:48:57,714
The dust of bones

485
00:48:57,783 --> 00:48:59,842
In the night I see the real

486
00:48:59,919 --> 00:49:03,946
Concealed in the day's bright lie

487
00:49:04,023 --> 00:49:06,218
Eyes stitched shut

488
00:49:06,292 --> 00:49:08,988
White teeth smile

489
00:49:09,061 --> 00:49:11,495
Sleep walks

490
00:49:11,564 --> 00:49:12,997
And talks

491
00:49:41,594 --> 00:49:43,892
Oh, jeez.

492
00:50:17,096 --> 00:50:19,223
I'm alive.

493
00:50:20,299 --> 00:50:22,563
Shit. I'm alive.

494
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,952
Nick Powell!

495
00:50:47,026 --> 00:50:50,792
Nick!

496
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:17,346
- Nick!
- Here! I'm right here!

497
00:51:20,225 --> 00:51:22,887
Hey, I'm over here!

498
00:51:22,961 --> 00:51:25,327
Here I am, right here.
Come here, boy.

499
00:51:25,397 --> 00:51:26,728
Good boy.

500
00:51:26,799 --> 00:51:30,496
Come here, come here, buddy.
This way, come here.

501
00:51:30,569 --> 00:51:32,366
Good boy!

502
00:51:33,706 --> 00:51:36,072
- Good boy!
- Hey, wait. You see me, don't you?

503
00:51:36,141 --> 00:51:38,939
Come here.

504
00:51:39,011 --> 00:51:42,242
- Good boy, come here. Good boy.
- Nicholas!

505
00:51:42,314 --> 00:51:45,147
"To Nicholas, From Mother."
Got something here!

506
00:51:45,217 --> 00:51:47,242
Good boy, you can see me, yeah!

507
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:50,186
No, no! Wrong way!

508
00:51:50,255 --> 00:51:53,520
- That way! I think he's onto something.
- No! Wait, don't go!

509
00:51:53,592 --> 00:51:57,551
Nick!

510
00:51:59,365 --> 00:52:00,730
Nicholas!

511
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:02,426
Pete.

512
00:52:02,501 --> 00:52:04,765
Why was Annie calling you?

513
00:52:09,775 --> 00:52:11,208
They'll find him.

514
00:52:11,276 --> 00:52:13,608
It just takes some time,
you know? I mean, I...

515
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:17,137
...I was literally right there
when they found the watch.

516
00:52:17,216 --> 00:52:19,810
You were right there
and they didn't find the body.

517
00:52:20,786 --> 00:52:22,185
Nobody knows but us, so?

518
00:52:22,254 --> 00:52:24,722
What are you so afraid of?

519
00:52:26,191 --> 00:52:29,160
I can't take this.
I'm going to the police.

520
00:52:29,228 --> 00:52:31,389
You go to the police,
you go to jail.

521
00:52:33,332 --> 00:52:35,527
No.

522
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:37,125
I won't. It was you.

523
00:52:37,202 --> 00:52:40,000
You were right there
and you didn't do a thing.

524
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,670
You're in as deep as we are.

525
00:52:47,479 --> 00:52:49,913
Pete, I'm still alive out there.

526
00:52:50,816 --> 00:52:52,408
Pete...

527
00:52:54,987 --> 00:52:56,511
Pete!

528
00:53:04,663 --> 00:53:08,656
They know you did it
and they'll keep coming back.

529
00:53:08,734 --> 00:53:11,532
Don't think you can run, Annie,

530
00:53:11,603 --> 00:53:13,833
'cause they'll get you.

531
00:53:28,487 --> 00:53:30,455
Hey, Annie.

532
00:53:39,765 --> 00:53:41,699
I have to go away
for a little while.

533
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:45,567
Are you gonna go away
and never come back, like Mom?

534
00:53:45,637 --> 00:53:48,003
Go on, Annie, tell him.

535
00:53:52,311 --> 00:53:54,108
Here.

536
00:53:54,179 --> 00:53:56,943
- I want you to keep this for me.
- I don't want it.

537
00:53:57,015 --> 00:53:59,381
- It was Mom's
- I know.

538
00:53:59,451 --> 00:54:01,419
You need it more than I do.

539
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:09,192
- You're pretty great.
- Yeah, I know.

540
00:54:11,396 --> 00:54:13,261
Come here, little man.

541
00:54:18,136 --> 00:54:20,627
Do you know what I want
more than anything?

542
00:54:23,242 --> 00:54:26,143
Don't be like me.

543
00:54:28,113 --> 00:54:30,445
I ruin everything I touch.

544
00:54:30,516 --> 00:54:31,744
OK?

545
00:54:33,385 --> 00:54:36,912
One day, if I'm lucky, maybe
I'll get to do one good thing.

546
00:54:39,525 --> 00:54:41,550
Make you proud of me.

547
00:54:53,505 --> 00:54:54,972
How'd you get in here?

548
00:54:56,508 --> 00:54:58,669
Everybody's out there looking for you.

549
00:55:00,512 --> 00:55:02,537
You listening to me?

550
00:55:04,249 --> 00:55:07,446
- I want you out of here.
- No problem. I'm gone.

551
00:55:11,323 --> 00:55:13,484
Just know...

552
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:15,584
...if anything happens to Victor...

553
00:55:16,962 --> 00:55:19,192
...I will come back here,

554
00:55:19,264 --> 00:55:21,198
and I will kill you.

555
00:55:26,672 --> 00:55:29,106
Whatever you've done,
I want no part of it.

556
00:55:31,143 --> 00:55:34,237
So, your mom's gone,
your dad married somebody else,

557
00:55:34,313 --> 00:55:37,009
you all hate each other,
does that give you an excuse?

558
00:55:37,082 --> 00:55:38,572
Does that make it OK?

559
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,082
Well, you know what?

560
00:55:42,154 --> 00:55:44,782
Don't think about blaming
anyone but yourself.

561
00:55:44,856 --> 00:55:48,348
Annie, this is your fault!

562
00:55:49,428 --> 00:55:52,363
Goddamn it, Annie!
I'm still alive!

563
00:55:52,431 --> 00:55:54,456
Tell them where my body is!

564
00:55:54,533 --> 00:55:56,865
Oh, that's right!
You can't hear me.

565
00:55:56,935 --> 00:55:59,403
You can't hear me, Annie.

566
00:55:59,471 --> 00:56:03,464
Burnaby Police are not offering
any information at this point.

567
00:56:03,542 --> 00:56:06,534
We do know forensics
are on the scene.

568
00:56:06,612 --> 00:56:09,775
However, night has fallen
and with rain in the city...

569
00:56:09,848 --> 00:56:12,476
What's our time frame
if he's out there alive?

570
00:56:12,551 --> 00:56:16,385
It depends on his injuries.
I'd say two, three days, tops.

571
00:56:16,455 --> 00:56:18,013
All right.

572
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,841
- Nice shop.
- We're closed, man.

573
00:56:43,915 --> 00:56:46,281
- You only work on the old cars?
- No.

574
00:56:46,351 --> 00:56:48,216
What about you work on, say, an '03?

575
00:56:48,286 --> 00:56:51,653
Sure thing, man. Come back tomorrow,
I'll sort you out, all right?

576
00:56:51,723 --> 00:56:54,886
Hey, I know you.
You're Marcus Bohem.

577
00:56:56,628 --> 00:56:58,459
You go out with
Annie Newton, right?

578
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:00,054
Yeah, that's right.

579
00:57:00,132 --> 00:57:01,963
You seen her lately?

580
00:57:05,203 --> 00:57:07,603
No. Well, I see her sometimes.

581
00:57:07,673 --> 00:57:10,141
Hmm. Open relationship.

582
00:57:11,209 --> 00:57:14,007
- You see her on Tuesday night?
- Yeah, I was with her.

583
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,604
- School night.
- Yeah.

584
00:57:16,682 --> 00:57:21,415
Because Monday night she got busted
for a smash-and-grab at a jewelry store.

585
00:57:21,486 --> 00:57:25,013
You know, and they
took a car the same time.

586
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:27,456
And so, you weren't
with her that night?

587
00:57:27,526 --> 00:57:31,690
- I don't know anything about that.
- Good. That's good.

588
00:57:31,763 --> 00:57:34,197
No, but she phoned you
from the police station.

589
00:57:34,266 --> 00:57:37,827
Right, but I wasn't with
her that night, you see?

590
00:57:37,903 --> 00:57:39,495
OK.

591
00:57:40,605 --> 00:57:42,971
How long has it been?

592
00:57:43,041 --> 00:57:44,030
Hmm.

593
00:57:46,578 --> 00:57:49,274
I've been on parole eight
months with a clean record.

594
00:57:49,347 --> 00:57:51,508
- You can check with my PO.
- I already did.

595
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:53,608
OK.

596
00:57:53,685 --> 00:57:56,415
You see Annie, you tell her
I want to talk to her.

597
00:57:57,556 --> 00:57:59,547
About a missing person at her school.

598
00:57:59,624 --> 00:58:01,854
Know anything about it?

599
00:58:01,927 --> 00:58:03,155
No.

600
00:58:04,596 --> 00:58:07,827
2003 Mercedes S500.

601
00:58:07,899 --> 00:58:10,333
Car that got stolen.

602
00:58:10,402 --> 00:58:12,097
Keep an eye out for me.

603
00:58:29,154 --> 00:58:31,588
Yeah, well, let's see where he takes us.

604
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:48,629
Don't worry about it, Mom.

605
00:59:50,569 --> 00:59:53,003
This won't change
a thing for you.

606
00:59:53,071 --> 00:59:56,302
You got everything
all under control, right?

607
00:59:56,374 --> 01:00:00,435
You always had your...
your fingers in everything.

608
01:00:00,512 --> 01:00:03,606
You know, fingering
through this house.

609
01:00:03,682 --> 01:00:07,140
Me, my room.

610
01:00:08,186 --> 01:00:11,280
Don't! Don't feel a thing, Mom!

611
01:00:11,356 --> 01:00:14,848
You don't want to ruin your
face, your pretty face!

612
01:00:14,926 --> 01:00:17,156
I'm out there in the mud!

613
01:00:17,229 --> 01:00:20,062
I'm dying, Mom,
and you're sitting here

614
01:00:20,131 --> 01:00:23,760
with your briefs and your
herbal tea and your books!

615
01:00:23,835 --> 01:00:25,996
I wish you could
see me right now, Mom!

616
01:00:26,071 --> 01:00:28,039
So you know how sick I am of you!

617
01:00:28,106 --> 01:00:31,542
I am sick of you
and your perfect world!

618
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:35,444
I am sick of you 'cause
it's not perfect, you hear me?

619
01:01:48,887 --> 01:01:52,345
Oh, Nicky. Oh!

620
01:02:12,444 --> 01:02:13,672
Shut up, Pete.

621
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,774
Did you know you were
being followed by the police?

622
01:02:17,849 --> 01:02:19,817
Who are you?

623
01:02:19,884 --> 01:02:22,910
Did you know that you were
being followed by the police?

624
01:02:24,422 --> 01:02:26,356
- No.
- Well, you are.

625
01:02:27,525 --> 01:02:29,891
- You're coming with me.
- Where are we going?

626
01:02:48,279 --> 01:02:49,769
You wonder why I'm angry.

627
01:02:49,848 --> 01:02:53,750
Stomping through the forest in the
middle of the night, freezing cold,

628
01:02:53,818 --> 01:02:55,649
in the mud, with my good boots on.

629
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,654
Get up, come on.

630
01:02:57,722 --> 01:03:00,190
'Cause you guys are sloppy,
you don't think.

631
01:03:00,258 --> 01:03:02,658
I gotta clean up your mess
or it's gonna be on me.

632
01:03:02,727 --> 01:03:04,695
- You weren't there.
- Doesn't matter.

633
01:03:04,763 --> 01:03:07,391
Any of you go down, you'll
take me with you, I know it.

634
01:03:07,465 --> 01:03:09,956
I can't let you do that.
Where you going?

635
01:03:11,369 --> 01:03:14,133
He's in there.

636
01:03:17,308 --> 01:03:18,866
Jesus.

637
01:03:21,346 --> 01:03:22,404
Get over here, man.

638
01:03:23,214 --> 01:03:24,806
Why me?

639
01:03:24,883 --> 01:03:26,908
Why not Matty?

640
01:03:27,752 --> 01:03:28,980
Or Dean?

641
01:03:29,054 --> 01:03:30,043
Why you?

642
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:33,815
Because you're weak.

643
01:03:33,892 --> 01:03:35,883
Now get over here.

644
01:03:36,828 --> 01:03:39,228
Lift it up, man. Let's go.

645
01:03:50,942 --> 01:03:53,240
Oh, Jesus, man.

646
01:03:55,547 --> 01:03:57,447
What did you do, man?

647
01:03:57,515 --> 01:04:01,246
<i>... and make your entire body over</i>
<i>exactly the way you want it,</i>

648
01:04:01,319 --> 01:04:04,254
<i>all in as little as six weeks.</i>

649
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:14,089
Mrs. Egan? Detective Tunney.

650
01:04:15,567 --> 01:04:17,194
Come in.

651
01:04:17,268 --> 01:04:20,669
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour,
but is your son Peter home?

652
01:04:20,738 --> 01:04:21,762
What's this about?

653
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,742
We believe your son is involved
in the disappearance of Nicholas Powell.

654
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:28,040
- That's ridiculous.
- They were friends.

655
01:04:28,113 --> 01:04:30,240
If we could just
ask him a few questions.

656
01:04:30,315 --> 01:04:33,773
He's downstairs right now.

657
01:04:56,074 --> 01:04:57,507
Come on.

658
01:04:59,077 --> 01:05:01,443
We know that was Nick's money, Pete.

659
01:05:01,513 --> 01:05:04,676
- I watched you break into his house.
- You followed him?

660
01:05:04,749 --> 01:05:07,479
We believe he's involved
in the disappearance.

661
01:05:07,552 --> 01:05:09,520
Ridiculous. They're good friends.

662
01:05:09,587 --> 01:05:13,648
I understand. That's why if Pete knows
anything we thought he'd wanna help.

663
01:05:13,725 --> 01:05:16,319
You're better
than you think you are, Pete.

664
01:05:16,394 --> 01:05:18,021
Don't be such a coward.

665
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:20,458
Tell 'em what you know.

666
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,425
This is the report.
It's what you expected.

667
01:05:26,804 --> 01:05:30,535
Forensics came back.
The DNAs match for Nick Powell.

668
01:05:31,442 --> 01:05:33,535
Hey, look, my son's not under arrest,

669
01:05:33,611 --> 01:05:36,171
and we've cooperated
more than we had to.

670
01:05:36,247 --> 01:05:40,513
It's getting late. Peter has school
tomorrow. So if there's nothing else.

671
01:05:40,585 --> 01:05:42,075
Let's go.

672
01:05:49,761 --> 01:05:51,251
Where's Annie Newton?

673
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:54,792
God damn it! Say something, Pete!

674
01:05:54,866 --> 01:05:57,357
Peter? Peter?

675
01:05:57,435 --> 01:05:58,697
Let's go.

676
01:06:02,707 --> 01:06:04,004
Talk to you soon, Pete.

677
01:06:04,075 --> 01:06:05,702
Talk to you soon, Pete.

678
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:17,950
Annie, it's me.
We gotta meet. It's Matty.

679
01:06:18,022 --> 01:06:19,717
He says he's going to the cops.

680
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:22,021
- Where are you?
- I got him at the bridge.

681
01:06:22,093 --> 01:06:24,561
Keep him there,
I'll be right over.

682
01:06:28,466 --> 01:06:30,195
She's coming.

683
01:06:30,268 --> 01:06:33,066
All right.
You guys did the right thing.

684
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,765
- Man, what're you gonna do?
- What am I gonna do?

685
01:06:37,842 --> 01:06:41,141
What do you think I'm gonna do?
She's out of control, man.

686
01:06:41,212 --> 01:06:44,579
- <i>I need you to do something for me.</i>
- Look, you gotta leave me alone.

687
01:06:44,649 --> 01:06:47,641
<i>Dean and Matty are up to something,</i>
<i>meet them at the bridge.</i>

688
01:06:47,719 --> 01:06:50,244
No. I can't take
this anymore, OK?

689
01:06:50,321 --> 01:06:51,754
<i>You wanna go missing, too?</i>

690
01:06:59,397 --> 01:07:01,831
Hey, hey hey!
Wake up!

691
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,966
Please, pay attention!

692
01:07:09,274 --> 01:07:11,435
Oh, my God.

693
01:07:17,649 --> 01:07:21,483
Go, go, go, go!
Come on, fly! Fly!

694
01:07:30,762 --> 01:07:31,922
Thank you.

695
01:07:37,001 --> 01:07:39,469
What the hell are you
doing here? Where's Annie?

696
01:07:39,537 --> 01:07:43,268
- She says you have to talk to me.
- What? Oh, shit.

697
01:07:43,341 --> 01:07:45,707
Hey, baby girl.

698
01:07:45,777 --> 01:07:47,574
This is not right.

699
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:56,980
Go home.

700
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:00,582
We've gotta get out of here.

701
01:08:00,658 --> 01:08:03,718
- There's a tail on him.
- There's just no loyalty these days.

702
01:08:03,795 --> 01:08:06,787
Shut your mouth. You need
to learn to shut your mouth.

703
01:08:06,864 --> 01:08:09,628
Or someone's gonna shut it for you.

704
01:08:09,701 --> 01:08:12,670
And who would that be, Marcus? You?

705
01:08:26,684 --> 01:08:28,015
Marcus, the cops.

706
01:08:31,422 --> 01:08:33,652
- Annie!
- Drop the gun, Annie.

707
01:08:33,725 --> 01:08:36,660
- Drop it now!
- Put the gun down.

708
01:08:36,728 --> 01:08:39,492
Hold your fire.

709
01:08:39,564 --> 01:08:41,361
Put the gun down!

710
01:08:48,539 --> 01:08:50,530
Annie, stop!

711
01:08:52,877 --> 01:08:55,505
Annie! Annie!

712
01:08:57,648 --> 01:08:59,980
Annie, stop!

713
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:10,491
Nice.

714
01:09:10,561 --> 01:09:13,530
Come on, Annie, where's
Nicholas? Just give it up.

715
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,267
They'll catch you, Annie!

716
01:09:24,342 --> 01:09:25,866
Never!

717
01:09:28,112 --> 01:09:29,943
Never!

718
01:09:30,014 --> 01:09:31,811
She heard me.

719
01:09:33,151 --> 01:09:36,587
She heard me!
You heard me!

720
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:41,204
- Baby girl, where'd you get this?
- It was Marcus's.

721
01:09:43,177 --> 01:09:45,771
- One fifty.
- It's worth ten times that.

722
01:09:45,847 --> 01:09:47,439
It's worth twenty times that.

723
01:09:47,515 --> 01:09:50,450
But, word is, you're in trouble
and I'm in business, so...

724
01:09:50,518 --> 01:09:51,849
One fifty.

725
01:09:54,655 --> 01:09:57,385
- Two hundred.
- I just need a roof right now.

726
01:09:58,693 --> 01:10:01,184
Go on, disappear.

727
01:12:04,218 --> 01:12:07,278
Yeah, this is where
I wanna be right now.

728
01:12:24,839 --> 01:12:26,830
I'm sorry.

729
01:12:28,743 --> 01:12:31,041
I saw your face that night, Annie.

730
01:12:35,516 --> 01:12:38,644
And I think right then, you
would've traded places with me.

731
01:12:48,129 --> 01:12:50,893
You know, sometimes
I wish my mom was dead.

732
01:12:52,633 --> 01:12:54,225
Instead of my dad.

733
01:12:56,103 --> 01:12:59,197
I always did what she wanted.

734
01:12:59,273 --> 01:13:01,639
You know, and I never even argued.

735
01:13:04,145 --> 01:13:08,707
You know, maybe if I was a little more
like you, we both wouldn't be here.

736
01:13:11,285 --> 01:13:13,617
I'm sorry.

737
01:13:18,592 --> 01:13:19,923
Annie.

738
01:13:21,963 --> 01:13:24,761
I know you can hear me.

739
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,261
Just tell them
where my body is.

740
01:13:37,211 --> 01:13:40,612
<i>We go live on the scene with</i>
<i>the latest developments in this case.</i>

741
01:13:40,681 --> 01:13:43,343
<i>The search is on tonight</i>
<i>for suspect Annie Newton</i>

742
01:13:43,417 --> 01:13:47,683
<i>in the case of missing Mckinley high</i>
<i>school honor student Nicholas Powell.</i>

743
01:13:47,755 --> 01:13:51,919
<i>The 18-year-old is considered</i>
<i>armed and dangerous.</i>

744
01:13:51,993 --> 01:13:55,019
<i>Newton evaded capture</i>
<i>earlier in the day...</i>

745
01:13:55,096 --> 01:13:57,496
I'm not gonna give up on you, Annie.

746
01:13:57,565 --> 01:13:59,123
I'm not giving up on you.

747
01:14:09,777 --> 01:14:11,608
What about Victor?

748
01:14:19,053 --> 01:14:21,544
Is he gonna end up
just like you, Annie?

749
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,325
Stop the bus.

750
01:15:38,199 --> 01:15:40,429
I'm dying, Annie.

751
01:15:41,268 --> 01:15:43,862
I don't have much time left

752
01:15:43,938 --> 01:15:46,964
and you're the only one
that can save my life.

753
01:15:48,742 --> 01:15:51,302
How messed up is that?

754
01:15:55,116 --> 01:15:57,084
Annie!

755
01:16:09,029 --> 01:16:11,156
I'm right here, Annie.

756
01:16:13,167 --> 01:16:14,395
Right here.

757
01:17:26,874 --> 01:17:29,240
Annie.

758
01:18:23,297 --> 01:18:25,197
Clear this stuff out of the way.

759
01:18:25,266 --> 01:18:27,325
Come on, quit fooling around.
Let's go.

760
01:19:25,959 --> 01:19:28,792
Why are we here, Annie?

761
01:19:28,862 --> 01:19:30,887
There's no time.

762
01:19:41,709 --> 01:19:43,870
There you are.

763
01:19:43,944 --> 01:19:46,310
I remember you.

764
01:19:48,382 --> 01:19:49,974
You were always so scrubbed.

765
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:51,984
You were in Miss Vogel's class?

766
01:19:54,188 --> 01:19:56,748
- She was such a bitch.
- She was such a bitch.

767
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:30,347
That was fourth of July weekend.

768
01:20:30,424 --> 01:20:32,255
Thirteen years old.

769
01:20:35,462 --> 01:20:38,829
That's the last thing
I ever did with my dad.

770
01:20:38,899 --> 01:20:41,094
My mom used to take me there.

771
01:21:08,662 --> 01:21:10,789
Come on. Hurry, Annie. Come on.

772
01:21:18,205 --> 01:21:20,298
Come on.

773
01:21:26,947 --> 01:21:29,677
No. No.

774
01:21:41,195 --> 01:21:44,358
Pete. Pete was here.

775
01:21:44,431 --> 01:21:48,800
Annie. Annie, somebody
was here to move my body.

776
01:21:48,869 --> 01:21:52,532
Who moved my body?
Think, Annie. Think.

777
01:21:54,341 --> 01:21:56,309
It's there, it's right there.

778
01:21:57,277 --> 01:21:59,438
Come on, Annie.
It's right there.

779
01:21:59,513 --> 01:22:01,344
Come on, Annie.

780
01:22:08,956 --> 01:22:11,015
Hang on, Nick.

781
01:22:16,864 --> 01:22:19,526
You're doing a great job,
decorating committee.

782
01:22:20,834 --> 01:22:24,201
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

783
01:22:24,271 --> 01:22:26,296
As you all know...

784
01:22:26,373 --> 01:22:28,933
As most of... No...

785
01:22:29,009 --> 01:22:30,977
As most of you probably know,

786
01:22:31,044 --> 01:22:35,037
this week has been a tough one.

787
01:22:37,818 --> 01:22:40,810
- Where's Nick?
- Don't know what you're talking about.

788
01:22:40,888 --> 01:22:43,857
- Don't start, Pete. Just tell her.
- Answer me!

789
01:22:43,924 --> 01:22:45,858
Answer me!

790
01:22:45,926 --> 01:22:48,952
You know what's really screwed
up about this whole thing?

791
01:22:49,029 --> 01:22:52,487
- Nick didn't do it.
- What the hell are you saying?

792
01:22:53,567 --> 01:22:55,034
Nick didn't turn you in.

793
01:22:55,102 --> 01:22:57,536
- You're lying.
- No, I lied.

794
01:22:57,604 --> 01:22:59,834
I thought he left town,
I lied to save my ass.

795
01:22:59,907 --> 01:23:01,898
- You're lying.
- You know what?

796
01:23:01,975 --> 01:23:05,502
- I didn't do it, either.
- What are you talking about?

797
01:23:05,579 --> 01:23:09,015
You killed Nick for nothing.

798
01:23:10,384 --> 01:23:11,749
- Nothing.
- You're lying.

799
01:23:11,818 --> 01:23:14,651
- Jesus, man.
- Then don't believe me.

800
01:23:14,721 --> 01:23:17,884
- Where's the body?
- Where'd you put the body?

801
01:23:17,958 --> 01:23:21,394
I know you couldn't do it alone.
Who helped you?

802
01:23:21,461 --> 01:23:23,088
Who helped you?

803
01:23:25,399 --> 01:23:27,026
Marcus.

804
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,897
Marcus?

805
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:33,033
- Marcus.
- What's going on here?

806
01:23:53,093 --> 01:23:55,755
Little cozy, don't you think?

807
01:23:55,829 --> 01:23:57,319
Miss me, baby boy?

808
01:23:58,065 --> 01:24:00,226
- Get out. I said get out.
- What?

809
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:09,875
Where you gonna shoot me?
Outside a cop shop, baby girl?

810
01:24:09,943 --> 01:24:13,674
If you want.
Or, you can drive.

811
01:24:15,616 --> 01:24:18,244
OK, I'll drive.

812
01:24:38,488 --> 01:24:40,956
Pete, what are you doing, man?

813
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,790
Keep walking.

814
01:24:49,333 --> 01:24:51,324
I didn't say stop.

815
01:24:51,401 --> 01:24:53,926
- You're not doing this.
- On your knees.

816
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:58,274
On your knees!

817
01:24:59,176 --> 01:25:01,303
All right.

818
01:25:04,147 --> 01:25:06,615
Pete, no! Pete!

819
01:25:06,683 --> 01:25:07,980
What are you doing, Pete?

820
01:25:08,051 --> 01:25:10,212
You don't need to do this,
I'm still alive!

821
01:25:10,287 --> 01:25:13,552
God, you're my last chance!
Pete, please!

822
01:25:13,623 --> 01:25:16,353
Trust me, this isn't the answer!

823
01:25:16,426 --> 01:25:19,020
If you die, I die, Pete!

824
01:25:19,096 --> 01:25:22,657
Pete, please!
This is not the way out!

825
01:25:22,733 --> 01:25:26,464
It was you.
You called the police on me.

826
01:25:26,536 --> 01:25:29,801
Nick was innocent,
I hurt him for nothing.

827
01:25:29,873 --> 01:25:32,808
Yeah, well, that was your choice,
wasn't it?

828
01:25:32,876 --> 01:25:35,003
Yeah, so is this.

829
01:25:35,812 --> 01:25:36,870
Jesus Christ.

830
01:25:36,947 --> 01:25:39,973
Pete, wake up!
Stay with me, come on!

831
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:41,608
Nick?

832
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:48,517
This is really weird.

833
01:25:48,592 --> 01:25:51,026
Pete, where'd you move my body to?

834
01:25:52,596 --> 01:25:54,826
- Pete, please.
- Where'd you move the body?

835
01:25:54,898 --> 01:25:56,991
What does it matter, Annie?

836
01:25:57,067 --> 01:25:58,591
- He's dead.
- No, he isn't!

837
01:25:58,668 --> 01:26:00,829
I saw him,
I looked into his eyes.

838
01:26:00,904 --> 01:26:02,599
- He's not dead!
- How do you know?

839
01:26:02,672 --> 01:26:05,004
- I just know, OK?
- Come on, Pete.

840
01:26:05,075 --> 01:26:08,340
- I screwed things up.
- I know. I know, Pete...

841
01:26:08,412 --> 01:26:11,245
- You're the only friend I had.
- I know, where's my body?

842
01:26:11,314 --> 01:26:13,339
For the last time, where is he?

843
01:26:13,417 --> 01:26:15,009
Where'd you move the body?

844
01:26:15,085 --> 01:26:18,919
In the ruins by the dam.
I'm so sorry, Nick.

845
01:26:18,989 --> 01:26:22,447
- Peter!
- I'm so sorry, please.

846
01:26:22,526 --> 01:26:24,687
- Peter?
- Nick?

847
01:26:24,761 --> 01:26:27,195
You want the body?
You'd better hurry, baby.

848
01:26:27,264 --> 01:26:30,256
- That water's gonna wash him away.
- Have a nice life.

849
01:26:32,669 --> 01:26:34,136
Hey, Annie?

850
01:27:05,969 --> 01:27:09,166
- Larson.
- You don't have to look for me anymore.

851
01:27:09,473 --> 01:27:11,373
- <i>Annie?</i>
- I can tell you where Nick is.

852
01:27:11,441 --> 01:27:15,036
<i>He's still alive. I just need</i>
<i>you to do one thing for me.</i>

853
01:27:15,111 --> 01:27:17,511
I left something for my brother.

854
01:27:17,581 --> 01:27:19,344
It's in my locker at school.

855
01:27:19,416 --> 01:27:21,384
Make sure he gets it, please.

856
01:27:21,451 --> 01:27:23,510
I'll take care of it.

857
01:27:23,587 --> 01:27:26,488
Nick's at the Broward Dam.

858
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,160
- OK.
- What is it?

859
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:09,562
- The dam gates open in 15 minutes.
- So, what are you saying?

860
01:28:09,633 --> 01:28:12,101
Anything downstream of it
will be flooded out.

861
01:28:34,524 --> 01:28:37,288
- How much time we got?
- We don't.

862
01:28:55,111 --> 01:28:57,306
Help me!

863
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:59,245
Help!

864
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:05,115
Somebody help me! Help!

865
01:29:18,535 --> 01:29:22,596
We don't have minutes.
We have to cut the flow. Now!

866
01:29:22,672 --> 01:29:24,970
Save me!

867
01:29:29,212 --> 01:29:30,645
Help!

868
01:29:30,714 --> 01:29:32,705
Help me!

869
01:29:53,169 --> 01:29:54,932
Keep looking.

870
01:30:04,914 --> 01:30:07,280
I want you to look everywhere.

871
01:30:18,094 --> 01:30:20,028
There! There he is!

872
01:30:20,096 --> 01:30:23,759
- Come on.
- Let's go! See if he's alive.

873
01:30:23,833 --> 01:30:26,597
He's alive, I got a pulse.

874
01:30:26,670 --> 01:30:30,106
- No response? Got it.
- Gotta get some fluids in him now.

875
01:30:30,173 --> 01:30:31,902
Get him up there
as quick as we can.

876
01:30:41,518 --> 01:30:43,486
Nick.

877
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:51,027
- Got it.
- C-collar on.

878
01:30:51,027 --> 01:30:53,723
- Got it.
- C-collar on.

879
01:30:54,998 --> 01:30:57,762
- You get the rhythm?
- Very slight.

880
01:30:57,834 --> 01:31:02,533
Mrs. Powell? This is
Detective Tunney. We found Nick.

881
01:31:03,506 --> 01:31:05,269
He's alive.

882
01:31:10,146 --> 01:31:12,478
- We need to get bags in him.
- Shut down.

883
01:31:12,549 --> 01:31:15,677
- I've got no IV access on that side.
- Damn it.

884
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:19,354
I got no pulse.

885
01:31:19,756 --> 01:31:22,054
He's in V-Tach,
charge the paddles.

886
01:31:27,564 --> 01:31:29,054
Clear!

887
01:31:29,733 --> 01:31:31,360
- Charge 300.
- Charging.

888
01:31:31,434 --> 01:31:32,696
Clear.

889
01:31:33,503 --> 01:31:34,970
- Charge to 360.
- Charging.

890
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:56,691
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

891
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:58,660
I'm just tired.

892
01:31:58,728 --> 01:32:01,060
I'm gonna have to ask
you to step out of the car.

893
01:32:01,131 --> 01:32:05,329
No. I have to be somewhere.

894
01:32:06,703 --> 01:32:08,330
Ma'am! Ma'am!

895
01:32:15,945 --> 01:32:18,743
Teenage male found down
rescued from the base of a dam,

896
01:32:18,815 --> 01:32:20,339
unconscious...

897
01:32:20,416 --> 01:32:21,883
Nicholas?

898
01:32:21,951 --> 01:32:24,886
- Let me be with my son.
- The team will do everything we can.

899
01:32:24,954 --> 01:32:28,253
- He needs me, he needs me.
- We will do everything we can.

900
01:32:28,324 --> 01:32:30,087
Now, please.

901
01:33:35,358 --> 01:33:38,350
Get out of the car,
put your hands on your head.

902
01:33:51,407 --> 01:33:52,965
Annie, I need you.

903
01:33:53,042 --> 01:33:55,977
- I need you, Annie.
- Turn off the engine.

904
01:33:56,045 --> 01:33:59,037
Get out of the car,
hands on your head now!

905
01:34:34,317 --> 01:34:36,615
And what was the status
when we found him?

906
01:35:13,122 --> 01:35:14,851
Annie.

907
01:35:16,492 --> 01:35:17,618
This way.

908
01:35:20,263 --> 01:35:23,824
I just got word a nurse spotted a girl
matching Annie's description.

909
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:25,834
Stop! Stop.

910
01:35:27,804 --> 01:35:29,533
What?

911
01:35:29,605 --> 01:35:31,095
Nothing.

912
01:35:31,774 --> 01:35:33,674
OK, go.

913
01:35:39,716 --> 01:35:41,479
Hurry.

914
01:35:46,556 --> 01:35:48,956
I'm right here.

915
01:35:49,025 --> 01:35:51,459
I'm in here.

916
01:35:54,230 --> 01:35:55,959
You have some nerve.

917
01:35:56,032 --> 01:35:58,000
No, Mom. No.

918
01:35:58,067 --> 01:35:59,762
I just need to talk to him.

919
01:35:59,836 --> 01:36:03,567
Talk? He can't talk,
thanks to you.

920
01:36:03,639 --> 01:36:06,574
- You should hate me.
- Hate you? Yes.

921
01:36:06,642 --> 01:36:08,906
I do. I hate you.

922
01:36:08,978 --> 01:36:10,240
- Excuse me.
- Don't.

923
01:36:10,313 --> 01:36:12,110
Please, don't.

924
01:36:14,751 --> 01:36:16,810
I can't ask you to forgive me.

925
01:36:16,886 --> 01:36:19,548
Stop it, Mom, stop it!

926
01:36:22,759 --> 01:36:25,353
It's OK, she loves you.

927
01:36:25,428 --> 01:36:28,090
What did you say?

928
01:36:28,164 --> 01:36:29,825
Tell her that I'm here.

929
01:36:31,934 --> 01:36:35,199
- I don't know how to say this, but...
- Just tell her.

930
01:36:37,173 --> 01:36:39,539
He's here.

931
01:36:39,609 --> 01:36:41,372
- Nick.
- Don't.

932
01:36:41,444 --> 01:36:43,378
Don't you talk about my son.

933
01:36:43,446 --> 01:36:45,311
You have to make her listen to you.

934
01:36:45,381 --> 01:36:47,178
You have to make her listen.

935
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:49,343
I can feel him here.

936
01:36:50,987 --> 01:36:53,114
Everywhere.

937
01:36:53,189 --> 01:36:56,317
I can even hear him.
I know what he wants.

938
01:36:56,392 --> 01:36:59,088
I don't believe you.

939
01:36:59,162 --> 01:37:01,528
Tell her that she was in my room.

940
01:37:01,597 --> 01:37:03,462
You were in his room.

941
01:37:05,368 --> 01:37:06,630
After I disappeared.

942
01:37:06,702 --> 01:37:09,193
- After he was gone.
- What are you doing?

943
01:37:09,272 --> 01:37:12,400
You read one of my poems,

944
01:37:12,475 --> 01:37:14,568
for the first time.

945
01:37:15,478 --> 01:37:16,968
I was there, Mom.

946
01:37:17,046 --> 01:37:19,674
I watched you.

947
01:37:19,749 --> 01:37:21,842
I read it with you.

948
01:37:23,152 --> 01:37:25,450
And you couldn't even finish it.

949
01:37:27,657 --> 01:37:29,682
You were hurting too much,

950
01:37:29,759 --> 01:37:31,624
and I see that now.

951
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:38,230
I never understood what you were
going through after Dad died.

952
01:37:38,301 --> 01:37:41,532
How Ionely you felt.

953
01:37:41,604 --> 01:37:44,732
But, I'm still here, Mom.

954
01:37:44,807 --> 01:37:47,640
And you have to believe that.

955
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:49,735
I'm here.

956
01:37:51,147 --> 01:37:53,775
I'm here.

957
01:37:53,850 --> 01:37:55,613
What do you want?

958
01:37:55,685 --> 01:37:58,210
What do you want?

959
01:37:58,287 --> 01:38:02,781
I need to see him,
just for a minute.

960
01:38:02,859 --> 01:38:04,884
- No.
- I can help him.

961
01:38:04,961 --> 01:38:06,394
- No.
- Please.

962
01:38:06,462 --> 01:38:08,896
I don't know why,

963
01:38:08,965 --> 01:38:11,195
but, I'm supposed to be here.

964
01:38:16,539 --> 01:38:18,439
I can bring him back.

965
01:39:17,533 --> 01:39:20,127
I'm so sorry, Nick.

966
01:39:24,807 --> 01:39:27,469
I didn't see you before.

967
01:39:30,913 --> 01:39:32,744
I didn't know you.

968
01:39:37,153 --> 01:39:40,554
I wish I could take it all back.

969
01:39:45,394 --> 01:39:46,861
Nick.

970
01:39:47,964 --> 01:39:49,522
Annie.

971
01:39:51,867 --> 01:39:54,131
Please.

972
01:39:54,203 --> 01:39:56,364
Don't go.

973
01:39:56,439 --> 01:39:58,930
Annie. I'm here.

974
01:39:59,008 --> 01:40:01,533
I'm right here.

975
01:40:20,029 --> 01:40:21,929
Nick.

976
01:41:00,736 --> 01:41:02,761
Annie.

977
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:12,705
I see you.

978
01:41:13,849 --> 01:41:16,682
I see you.

979
01:41:19,588 --> 01:41:22,148
Nick...

980
01:41:22,992 --> 01:41:25,756
I wanted to do one good thing.

981
01:41:25,828 --> 01:41:29,059
You did, Annie.

982
01:41:29,131 --> 01:41:31,292
You did.

983
01:41:32,702 --> 01:41:35,466
You saved me.

984
01:41:44,513 --> 01:41:46,071
You saved me.

985
01:42:53,682 --> 01:42:55,980
I like your plane.

986
01:42:57,787 --> 01:43:01,154
- What is it?
- Dragonfly 220.

987
01:43:01,957 --> 01:43:03,925
Yeah.

988
01:43:05,594 --> 01:43:07,619
Should you be
out here alone?

989
01:43:07,696 --> 01:43:11,132
- Where are your parents?
- They don't know I'm here.

990
01:43:12,968 --> 01:43:16,665
- My sister was supposed to bring me.
- But she didn't?

991
01:43:18,541 --> 01:43:20,236
She died.

992
01:43:22,344 --> 01:43:24,141
Think we should send her a message?

993
01:43:24,213 --> 01:43:25,407
How?

994
01:43:33,856 --> 01:43:37,087
What should we say?

995
01:43:37,159 --> 01:43:39,354
It's your message.

996
01:43:41,864 --> 01:43:44,424
Hey, Annie...

997
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:45,592
Hey, Annie.

998
01:44:00,249 --> 01:44:02,479
- That's it.
- That's it?
