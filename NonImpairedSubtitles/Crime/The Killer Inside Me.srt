Lives about four or five miles
out on Derrick Road

00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:53,286
past the old Branch place.

26
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:54,725
- Oh, l know the old
Branch place.

27
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:56,092
She a hustlin` lady, Bob?

28
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:57,426
- Well, l guess so,

29
00:01:57,464 --> 00:01:59,830
but she`s-she`s been
pretty decent about it.

30
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:01,663
She ain`t taken on
no roustabouts

or nothin` like that.

32

ln fact,

33
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:06,501
if these preachers around town
weren`t rompin` down on me,

34
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,007
l wouldn`t bother her at all.

35
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,099
- Well, how shall l handle it?

36
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:10,939
Tell her to lay off
awhile or...

37
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:12,638
- Oh, l don`t know.
l don`t know.

38
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:15,978
Just go out and size her up
and make your own decision.

39
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:17,540
l know you`ll be gentle,

40

So go on out there,

42
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:24,252

- Oh, hello.
- Mornin`, ma`am.

46
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:51,451
The troubIe with growing up
in a smaII town

47
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:53,817
is everybody thinks
they know who you are.

48
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:02,594
I was born here 29 years ago.

49
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:04,119
And CentraI City
was smaII enough

50
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:08,624
that my father
was the onIy doctor in town.

51
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:09,794
Then the oiI boom came,

52
00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:13,704
and the town grew
to fit its name.

53
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,674
The sheriff`s office handIes
the poIicing

54
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,370
for both the city
and the county.

55
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,244
We do a pretty good job of it,
to our own way of thinkin`.

56
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,943
We`re kind of oId-fashioned.

57
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:25,952
Out here, you say,
``Yes, ma`am, `` and ``No, ma`am, ``

58
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:28,853
to anything with a skirt on.

59
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:30,789
Out here, if you catch a man
with his pants down,

60
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:32,189
you apoIogize,

61
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:34,887
even if you have to arrest him
afterwards.

62
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:39,124
Out here, you`re a man
and a gentIeman,

63
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:42,293
or you aren`t anything at aII.

64
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:44,428
And God heIp you
if you`re not.

65
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:57,310
[knocking]

66
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:08,287
- Yes?

67
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:10,387
- l`m sorry, ma`am, uh...

68
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,227
- Oome on in.

69
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,759
You go on back.

70
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:19,795
l just need to wash up.

71
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:41,392
What do you think
you`re doing with that?

72
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:43,521
- Sheriff`s office, ma`am.

73
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:44,621
What are you doing with it?

74
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:46,791
- l have a permit.

75
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:55,138
Are you satisfied, copper?

76
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:02,773
- Well, l reckon it`s all right.

77
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:05,842
And my name`s Ford, ma`am,
not Oopper.

78
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:08,046
- Jesus.

79
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:10,556
The only decent-looking guy
l`ve seen in this stink hole

80
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,184
and he`s a boy scout
with a badge.

81
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:14,659
How much?

82
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:15,820
l don`t jazz cops.

83
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:17,921
- That`s not very polite, ma`am.

84
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:19,898
l just came out here
for a little talk.

85
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:21,594
- And l asked you
what you wanted.

86
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:25,469
- Well, l guess l want you
out of Oentral Oity by sundown.

87
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:28,440
And if l see you
here after that...

88
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:29,965
l`m gonna run you in
for prostitution.

89
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,170
- You lousy son of a bitch.

90
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:33,202
- Don`t you call me that, ma`am.

100
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:54,084
- l`m sorry.
- no.

101
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:57,119
Don`t say you`re sorry.

102
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:20,141

- % Give me one hand loose
and l`ll be satisfied %

109
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:33,430
I went back the next day
and the day after that.

110
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:34,956
I couIdn`t heIp it.

111
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,128
It was Iike a wind had been
turned on a dying fire.

112

just you and me.

Let me hear you say it.

128
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:43,964
- Don`t.

129
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:46,062
- You think
you`re too good for me.

130
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:47,629
- Don`t start that.

131
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:50,040
- You do.

132
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:52,601
l`ll never give you up.

133
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,772
never.

134
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:56,475
And if you think
you`re too good for me now,

135
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:58,040
l`ll make it so you won`t be.

136
00:08:58,084 --> 00:09:03,249
- Oh, baby, you got your bowels
in an uproar all over nothin`.

137
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:05,223
l was just thinkin`
about the money.

138
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:06,725
- l can get money.

139
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,226
- Oh, yeah?

140
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:13,289
- He`s crazy about me,
and he`s dumb as hell.

- l`m sorry?

142
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:18,002
Who`s crazy about you
and dumb as hell?

143
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:21,473
- Elmer Oonway.

144
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:23,975
You know who he is, don`t ya?

145
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:28,240
- I knew EImer Conway
weII enough.

146
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:30,749
We`d been in the same cIass
together at schooI.

147
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:32,546
Aw, he wasn`t a bad man.

148
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:34,553
He`d just been spoiIed.

149
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:37,715
SpoiIed by his father,
Chester Conway.

150
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:40,021
Chester had buiIt
haIf of CentraI City,

151
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,617
and he acted Iike
he owned the town,

152
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:45,722
and nobody had the guts
to teII him any different.

153
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:47,630
Joyce was a fooI to think
she couId put one over

154
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,760
on oId man Conway.

155
00:09:49,802 --> 00:09:51,497
But her pIan started me
thinking about

156
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:54,097
how I couId settIe
some oId scores of my own.

157
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:00,341
- You want a refill, hon?

158
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,472
- no, l`ve got to go.

159
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:02,503
- All right.

160
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:06,778
So you`re a deputy sheriff?

161
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:07,979

Dad thought that Mike would be
good company for me.

He was working on a girder
on a Oonway Oonstruction job.

Apparently he slipped
on a rivet.

So when he fell...

he threw himself backwards...

258
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:10,051
so he`d land inside the building
and onto the decking.

But the floors, they hadn`t been
decked in properly.

260

So he fell...

all the way to the basement.

323
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,280
- I Ioved Joyce,

324
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,685
and there were times
when her voice

325
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:31,383
seemed to whisper to me,

326
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:32,686
``Forget it, Lou.

But then I`d remember
Chester Conway,

329
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:39,094
and I knew I had to go through
with the pIan.

336
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:00,010

do anything.

341
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:11,323
l want you
to take the money yourself.

342
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:14,628
$1 0,000 in small bills.

343
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:15,793
- Oh, l won`t do that.

344
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:19,669
- now, you take it,
and you pay her off,

345
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:21,138
and you bust her around
a little bit,

346
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:22,435
and you run her
out of the county.

347
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:23,442
- Mr. Oonway.

348
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:24,773
- That`s the way you do it.

349
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,677
You pay her, you bust her,
and you run her out.

350
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:29,704
Did you say somethin`?

351
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:33,780
- now, look here,
Miss Lakeland insisted

352
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:36,686
that Elmer bring that money out
all by himself.

353
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:38,519
now, those are her terms,
and l-

354
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:41,924
- l don`t see what
she`s got to do with it.

355
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:42,928
- Well, what you don`t see

356
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:44,953
is that you have
a whole lot of gall.

357
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:45,986
- What`d you say?

358
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:47,430
- Well, how do you think
it would look

359
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:50,492
if it got around
that an officer of the law

360
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:53,164
had made a blackmail payoff?

361
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:54,729
now, Elmer came to me
with his trouble,

362
00:19:54,773 --> 00:19:55,740
and l came to you,

363
00:19:55,774 --> 00:19:57,173
and you asked me to see
what l could do

364
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:58,574
about gettin` this done
quietly,

365
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:00,772
and l`ve done all
that l can think to do,

366
00:20:00,813 --> 00:20:03,748
and l don`t see how you can
ask me to do one thing more.

367
00:20:07,653 --> 00:20:10,520
- Maybe you`re right, boy.

368
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:13,150
But you will see that she leaves
after she gets that money.

369
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:15,092
- lf she isn`t gone
after an hour,

370
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:18,062
l`ll move her on myself.

371
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:20,429
- Well, l`m gonna send Elmer
over to your place

372
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:22,957
as soon as l can locate him.

373
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:26,369
And you make sure
he`s got everything straight.

374
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:28,600
Understand?

375
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:35,110
- What if the old man
never cools off, hmm?

376
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:36,671
- Well, hold on, you told me
you were sure

377
00:20:36,715 --> 00:20:38,012
he was gonna come around.

378
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,041
lf that isn`t the case,
l better tell Miss Lakeland.

379
00:20:40,085 --> 00:20:42,178
- no. Don`t you do that, Lou.

380
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:43,381
- Why don`t you do this?

381
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:44,616
Why don`t you buy a business?

382
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:46,147
Then you and Joyce
can run it together,

383
00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:47,385
and when it gets goin` good,

384
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:50,589
then you get in touch
with your old man and...

385
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:52,119
he`ll see you made
a darned smart move.

Why?

for me and her, Lou?

do something for me.

Oome here.

646
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,393
now, you can say what you want
about me,

647
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:37,333
but don`t say that the girl
l`m gonna marry

648
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:41,236
is sleeping with a guy who would
run around with whores.

649
00:37:41,272 --> 00:37:42,534
- You don`t want to marry me.

650
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:43,939
- Yes, l do.

651
00:37:43,975 --> 00:37:46,000
l just didn`t
want to be told when.

652
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,711
l wanted to propose myself...

653
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,741
which is what l`m doing
right now.

654

[telephone ringing]

655
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:05,129
- Yeah, hello?

656
00:38:05,163 --> 00:38:06,221
- Hey, Lou, it`s Bob.

657
00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:07,253
- Bob, what`s on your mind?

658
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:10,556
[horn honks]

659
00:38:14,706 --> 00:38:16,230
- Hiya, Lou.

660
00:38:16,274 --> 00:38:17,502
Sorry to bother you.

661
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,840
l hope we didn`t
interrupt anything.

662
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:25,414
- You had a date for last night?

663
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,042
- That`s right.

664
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:29,576
- For what time?

665
00:38:29,621 --> 00:38:32,146
- Well, supposed to be
a little after 1 0:00,

666
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,316
the time l figured

667
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:35,019
l`d be finished
with the Oonway business.

668
00:38:37,228 --> 00:38:38,456
- Who`s the girl?

669
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:39,690
- Well, damn it.

670
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:41,528
now, that l don`t think
is any of your business.

671
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:45,935
- Howard, you know, you`re kind
of a newcomer out this way,

672
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,904
but you ought to know better
than to ask a man

673
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:49,804
a question like that.

674
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:51,433
- lt`s my job.

675
00:38:51,476 --> 00:38:54,968
lf Ford had himself a date
last night, then, uh...

676
00:38:55,013 --> 00:38:58,574
Well, you know what l mean,
Ford.

677
00:38:58,616 --> 00:38:59,878
- Well, no offense, Howard,

678
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:01,714
but l figured you did
all the jawing you had to do

679
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:03,243
when l talked
to you a couple hours ago.

680
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:04,254
- You`re wrong, brother.

681
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:05,846
- Okay, easy, Howard.

682
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:06,879
For cryin` out loud.

683
00:39:06,924 --> 00:39:07,891
l know the girl.

684
00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:09,119
l know her folks.

685
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,027
She`s one of the nicest
little ladies in town.

686
00:39:12,063 --> 00:39:15,555
l ain`t got the slightest doubt
that Lou had a date with her.

687
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,862
- The more
l`m around you people,

688
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:19,096
the less l understand you.

689
00:39:28,713 --> 00:39:30,943
Oome on.

690
00:39:33,718 --> 00:39:35,777
Let`s go.

691
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,220
Don`t be shy.
Oome on.

692
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,696
See that track there, Ford?

693
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,130
You know what caused that?

694
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:49,656
- l reckon so.

695
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:50,668
A flat tire.

696
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:52,135
- So you admit that.

697
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,764
That`s the sort of track
you`d get from a flat tire.

698
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:55,898
- What`s this all about, Bob?

699
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,669
- You know, l really don`t know,

700
00:39:57,709 --> 00:39:58,971
but this is Howard`s show,

701
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,637
so you might as well
just answer him.

702
00:40:00,678 --> 00:40:02,578
- Well, l already said it once.

703
00:40:02,613 --> 00:40:04,911
You get that track
from a flat tire, yes, sir.

704
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:09,446
- Oome see the track
your tire made.

705
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:15,086
Here we are.

706
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:19,222
The tire that made this track
wasn`t flat.

707
00:40:19,263 --> 00:40:20,628
- Well, l never said
l had a flat tire

708
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:21,962
when l pulled off the highway.

709
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:23,899
- now, wait a minute.
- no, l had a puncture, sure.

710
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:26,267
Felt the car sway a little,
but l pulled off the lane

711
00:40:26,304 --> 00:40:28,738
before the tire
could really go down.

712
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:35,608
l hope you boys didn`t chew up a
perfectly good tire for nothin`.

713
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:41,777
- Doggone it, Howard,

714
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:44,185
if this ain`t
the strangest damn deal.

715
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:52,261
- Getting away
with a stupid mistake

716
00:40:52,296 --> 00:40:55,094
can be a bIessing twice over.

717
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:56,930
When a man`s rope
sIides off you once,

718
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:59,436
he`s mighty cautious
about making a second throw.

719
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,563
- Feeling twitchy, Lou?

720
00:41:04,308 --> 00:41:06,367
- Oh, it`s just-

721
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,570
just a passing hunger.

722
00:41:07,612 --> 00:41:11,673
- Yeah, l wouldn`t mind
grabbing a bite myself.

723
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:14,981
- Joyce was bound to die
if she wasn`t dead aIready.

724
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:17,249
As soon as things quieted down,
I`d quit my job.

725
00:41:17,288 --> 00:41:18,619
I`d seII the house.

726
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:21,250
I`d Ieave CentraI City
once and for aII.

727
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:23,283
- Ooh, those look good.

728
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:26,589
- She still unconscious?

729
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:27,825
- Yeah.

730
00:41:29,867 --> 00:41:30,834
Thank you.

731
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:31,892
- And anything else for you?

732
00:41:31,936 --> 00:41:32,960
- no, l`m good, thank you.

733
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:36,371
- Enjoy your food.

734
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:40,070
- Oonway wants to fly her
to Fort Worth.

735
00:41:40,111 --> 00:41:42,978
Says she can`t get the right
kind of medical attention here.

736
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:46,207
- Yeah, well,
maybe l`ll go myself.

737
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,478
What do you think, Lou?

738
00:41:47,518 --> 00:41:50,248
Want to take a little flight
into Fort Worth?

739
00:41:50,288 --> 00:41:51,721
- l`ve never been
on an airplane.

740
00:41:51,756 --> 00:41:53,087
- Wait a minute.

741
00:41:53,124 --> 00:41:56,150
She hasn`t even been booked yet,
let alone arraigned.

742
00:41:57,762 --> 00:42:00,993
- Well, Oonway wasn`t asking you

743
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:02,522
if he could take her
to Fort Worth.

744
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:04,933
He was telling ya.

745
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:08,427
Did he say what time?

746
00:42:08,472 --> 00:42:11,464
- 1 2:30.

747
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:13,670
- Oh, well, that`ll give Lou
and me time

748
00:42:13,711 --> 00:42:15,303
to scrub up a little
and pack a bag.

749
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:17,610
Right, Lou?

750
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:19,673
- Yeah.

751
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:21,685
- What`s the matter
with those eggs, boy?

752
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:24,210
Better eat `em
before they get cold.

753
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:27,324
- Don`t.

754
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:28,620
I have to traveI.

755
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:30,024
- Baby, you aren`t
goin` anywhere.

756
00:42:30,061 --> 00:42:31,358
- I want to see her burn.

757
00:42:34,465 --> 00:42:36,763
[Bob laughs]

758
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:38,325
- First time on a plane,

759
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:40,735
and you waste the whole
damn trip sleepin`.

760
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:58,113
- Take it easy.

761
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:05,458
Sheriff.
- Yes, sir?

762
00:43:05,496 --> 00:43:07,396
- You go with the ambulance.

763
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:09,626
Lou, come on.

764
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:11,692
You ride in the car with me.

765
00:43:13,337 --> 00:43:14,998
- All right.

766
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:21,976
- You didn`t like that, did ya?

767
00:43:22,013 --> 00:43:24,880
The way l spoke
to ol` Bob Maples.

768
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:27,510
But l have a reputation,
and l`m not about to

769
00:43:27,551 --> 00:43:31,954
let anybody`s tender feelings
get in my way.

770
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:33,422
lf she pulls through
this operation,

771
00:43:33,457 --> 00:43:36,051
she`s gonna be able
to talk tonight.

772
00:43:36,093 --> 00:43:37,185
l want you to be there

773
00:43:37,228 --> 00:43:38,718
when she comes out
of that anesthetic.

774
00:43:38,763 --> 00:43:39,923
- What about Bob?

775
00:43:39,964 --> 00:43:43,127
- Bob Maples is too old
to be on his toes.

776
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,265
You can use my hotel suite.

777
00:43:48,306 --> 00:43:50,900
You just come over
when l give you a call.

778
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,674
Let`s go to the hospital.

779
00:44:06,557 --> 00:44:09,219
- Conway thought
he was a big shot.

780
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,887
But his son
had just been kiIIed

781
00:44:10,928 --> 00:44:13,590
by a whore
he`d faIIen in Iove with,

782
00:44:13,631 --> 00:44:15,758
and he`d never be abIe
to Iive it down,

783
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,665
not if he Iived to be 100,

784
00:44:17,702 --> 00:44:20,603
and I damned weII
hoped he wouId.

785
00:44:23,874 --> 00:44:25,899
It was the first time
I`d been out of West Texas,

786
00:44:25,943 --> 00:44:29,003
and I wanted to see the sights.

787
00:44:29,046 --> 00:44:32,209
Instead, I had to stay
cooped up in the hoteI.

788
00:44:34,285 --> 00:44:37,743
It was aImost Iike
there was a pIot against me.

789
00:44:37,788 --> 00:44:40,313
I had done something wrong
when I was a kid,

790
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:43,350
and I`d had my nose rubbed
in it day after day

791
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:44,918
untiI Iike an overtrained dog,

792
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:47,430
I started crapping
out of pure fright.

793
00:44:50,935 --> 00:44:51,902
- Hey there, Lou.

794
00:44:51,936 --> 00:44:54,370
- Hey, Bob.

795
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:56,464
- Quite a palace.

796
00:45:00,378 --> 00:45:02,403
- You know, Bob, l want you
to know that l`m awful sorry

797
00:45:02,446 --> 00:45:04,243
about what happened out there
at the airport.

798
00:45:05,716 --> 00:45:09,174
l didn`t like it one bit,
and l-l told Oonway that too.

799
00:45:14,759 --> 00:45:16,852
Did you have some kind
of trouble out at the hospital?

800
00:45:19,897 --> 00:45:21,660
- She`s dead, Lou.

801
00:45:26,037 --> 00:45:28,232
She never came out of the ether.

802
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:41,450
- Well, that`s that.

803

bucking the saddle a little bit,

967
00:55:44,988 --> 00:55:48,048
but l don`t see him
as a murderer.

968
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:51,652
- Elmer Oonway took 1 0,000 bucks
around to that chippy`s house.

969
00:55:51,695 --> 00:55:55,256
When we counted it up,
$500 was missing.

970
00:55:55,298 --> 00:55:56,265
- Yeah?

971
00:55:56,299 --> 00:55:58,028
- The bills were all marked,
see?

972
00:55:58,068 --> 00:56:00,036
The old man had already
tipped off the local banks.

973
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:02,004
lf she tried to hang around town
after the payoff,

974
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:03,802
he was gonna squeeze her
for blackmail.

975
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,933
That Oonway,
they don`t put many past him.

976
00:56:05,976 --> 00:56:09,503
- Well, seems like they put
a few past me.

977
00:56:09,546 --> 00:56:12,037
- Oh, come on Lou, you got
no reason to feel like that.

978
00:56:12,082 --> 00:56:14,949
- All right, let it go.

979
00:56:14,985 --> 00:56:16,646
So Johnnie spent some
of the money, then?

980
00:56:16,687 --> 00:56:17,779
- $20.

981
00:56:17,821 --> 00:56:19,516
Broke it at
the drugstore last night.

982
00:56:19,556 --> 00:56:21,683
Traced it back to him
a couple hours ago.

983
00:56:21,725 --> 00:56:23,022
now, he could`ve
taken that $20 in

984
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,755
and paid himself with it.

985
00:56:24,795 --> 00:56:26,319
But he couldn`t admit to it.

986
00:56:26,363 --> 00:56:28,854
And here`s the kick.

987
00:56:28,899 --> 00:56:30,662
From about 9:00 Sunday night
until 1 1 :00,

988
00:56:30,701 --> 00:56:32,225
his time
can`t be accounted for.

989
00:56:32,269 --> 00:56:34,965
We can`t account for it,

990
00:56:35,005 --> 00:56:37,235
and he just won`t.

991
00:56:37,274 --> 00:56:38,798
l know how you feel, Lou.

992
00:56:38,842 --> 00:56:40,366
He`s just a kid,
and you know him.

993
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,571
But you got to think about how
that poor woman must`ve felt

994
00:56:42,612 --> 00:56:44,671
when he was beating her face in.

995
00:56:44,715 --> 00:56:46,512
You saw what
her face looked like.

996
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:47,517
Stewed meat.

997
00:56:47,551 --> 00:56:48,518
Hamburger.

998
00:56:48,552 --> 00:56:50,247
- Oh, for Ohrist`s sake.

999
00:56:50,287 --> 00:56:52,915
- Hey, l`m sorry, Lou,
but that`s the truth of it.

1000
00:56:55,425 --> 00:56:57,086
- All right.

1001
00:56:59,496 --> 00:57:00,929
- Sweet talk him, Lou.

1002
00:57:06,803 --> 00:57:08,896
- l know this one.

1003
00:57:08,939 --> 00:57:10,873
- Hey, Ford,
get me out of here!

1004
00:57:10,907 --> 00:57:13,000
- He`s in the back.

1005
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:23,313
Want me to wait?

1006
00:57:23,353 --> 00:57:24,342
- no, l`ll be all right.

1007
00:57:24,387 --> 00:57:27,413
Thank you.

1008
00:57:27,457 --> 00:57:28,424
- Hey, Lou.

1009
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:29,447
- How ya doin`, Johnnie?

1010
00:57:29,493 --> 00:57:30,460
- Oh, l knew you`d come.

1011
00:57:30,494 --> 00:57:31,483
l sent for you.

1012
00:57:31,528 --> 00:57:32,927
- Everything`s gonna be
all right.

1013
00:57:32,963 --> 00:57:34,055
- Sure.

1014
00:57:34,097 --> 00:57:35,724
You got a cigarette, Lou?

1015
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:37,290
Those bastards
took all my cigarettes.

1016
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:41,395
- Ah, they`re just
doing their duty, kid.

1017
00:57:41,438 --> 00:57:43,929
Have a cigar.

1018
00:57:43,974 --> 00:57:45,965
- l`ll have one with ya.

1019
00:57:46,009 --> 00:57:48,102
- l don`t know
how you can stand it in here.

1020
00:57:48,145 --> 00:57:51,876
Sure driving me crazy.

1021
00:57:51,915 --> 00:57:56,716
- Well, it`d drive anyone crazy.

1022
00:57:56,753 --> 00:58:00,280
l think that`s the idea.

1023
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:01,347
- How soon can l leave?

1024
00:58:03,927 --> 00:58:06,088
- lt won`t be long now.

1025
00:58:19,276 --> 00:58:20,675
Say, you didn`t
tell those fellas

1026
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:22,610
about that $20 bill
l gave you, did you?

1027
00:58:22,646 --> 00:58:23,738
- no.

1028
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,476
What do you think l am, anyway?

1029
00:58:26,516 --> 00:58:28,882
Gosh, l know you don`t
make a lot of money.

1030
00:58:28,919 --> 00:58:30,819
You know, if someone
should slip you a little tip,

1031
00:58:30,854 --> 00:58:33,755
l`m not gonna say anything.

1032
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:37,417
- l don`t take bribes, Johnnie.

1033
00:58:41,097 --> 00:58:43,031
- Well, who said anything
about bribes?

1034
00:58:43,066 --> 00:58:45,660
- You just said something
about a bribe.

1035
00:58:45,702 --> 00:58:47,693
- Well, l just wasn`t gonna
let `em hit ya cold with it

1036
00:58:47,737 --> 00:58:49,329
until you figured out

1037
00:58:49,372 --> 00:58:51,499
or remembered
where you found it.

1038
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:54,533
- l wish you hadn`t done that.

1039
00:58:54,578 --> 00:58:57,103
You understand?

1040
00:58:57,147 --> 00:58:59,707
You understand that was
the wrong thing to do.

1041
00:59:00,851 --> 00:59:03,945
- l don`t care about those guys.

1042
00:59:03,987 --> 00:59:05,716
You`re my friend.

1043
00:59:15,332 --> 00:59:18,199
- l`ve got a foot on both sides
of the fence.

1044
00:59:18,235 --> 00:59:22,228
They were put there early,

1045
00:59:22,272 --> 00:59:25,070
and they stayed put.

1046
00:59:25,108 --> 00:59:29,772
l can`t move.
l can`t jump.

1047
00:59:29,813 --> 00:59:35,376
All l can do is wait
until l split

1048
00:59:35,418 --> 00:59:38,683
right down the middle.

1049
00:59:38,722 --> 00:59:41,020
You get it?

1050
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,053
- Yeah.

1051
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,167
- l killed them.

1052
00:59:54,204 --> 00:59:55,728
l killed both of them.

1053
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:01,203
- Bet you had
a real good reason, Lou.

1054
01:00:01,244 --> 01:00:03,439
- There`s a reason.

1055
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,278
- l bet they had it comin`.

1056
01:00:06,316 --> 01:00:07,647
- no.

1057
01:00:07,684 --> 01:00:10,346
nobody has it comin` to them.

1058
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:14,753
That`s why nobody
can see it comin`.

1059
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:27,831
Hi.

1060
01:00:27,871 --> 01:00:30,203
- Give ya any trouble, Lou?

1061
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,730
- not at all.

1062
01:01:20,623 --> 01:01:21,920
- Hi, honey.

1063
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:23,289
- l`m sorry.

1064
01:01:23,326 --> 01:01:24,554
- lt`s all right.

1065
01:01:24,594 --> 01:01:25,686
Where have you been?

1066
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:54,913
[moaning]

1067
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:33,118
[telephone ringing]

1068
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:37,690
- Yeah, hello?

1069
01:02:37,734 --> 01:02:38,701
- Lou.

1070
01:02:38,735 --> 01:02:39,827
Hendricks.

1071
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:41,063
- What is it, Howard?
lt`s late.

1072
01:02:41,104 --> 01:02:42,571
- Johnnie Pappas.

1073
01:02:42,605 --> 01:02:44,266
You reaIIy put the fear of God
into the boy.

1074
01:02:44,307 --> 01:02:46,332
- Sign a confession, did he?

1075
01:02:46,376 --> 01:02:47,536
- WeII, more than that, Lou.

1076
01:02:47,577 --> 01:02:48,942
He hanged himseIf.

1077
01:02:48,978 --> 01:02:50,377
- Thank you for calling, Howard.

1078
01:02:50,413 --> 01:02:52,904
l appreciate it.

1079
01:02:57,387 --> 01:03:01,118
- What was that all about?

1080
01:03:01,157 --> 01:03:04,786
Hmm?

1081
01:03:04,828 --> 01:03:06,455
- Johnnie Pappas hanged himself.

1082
01:03:08,064 --> 01:03:10,225
- Oh, no, Lou.

1083
01:03:14,871 --> 01:03:17,533
Baby, l`m so sorry.

1084
01:03:27,984 --> 01:03:30,316
- After Johnnie`s death,
somethin` changed.

1085
01:03:30,353 --> 01:03:32,947
It wasn`t anything
I couId put my finger on,

1086
01:03:32,989 --> 01:03:34,957
but I got the feeIing
that peopIe were Iooking at me

1087
01:03:34,991 --> 01:03:36,185
in a different way.

1088
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:49,202
Bob MapIes kept on drinkin`,

1089
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:51,730
and he seemed to age
about ten years.

1090
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:56,205
And nobody
taIked about Johnnie.

1091
01:03:56,246 --> 01:03:59,477
But that didn`t stop me
from thinking about him,

1092
01:03:59,516 --> 01:04:01,143
and I reaIized
a week had gone by,

1093
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:04,278
and I hadn`t paid my respects
to Max Pappas.

1094
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,947
- And here`s a Iook
at the weather picture.

1095
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:07,183
It`s gonna be the same.

1096
01:04:07,223 --> 01:04:08,918
CIear today,
turning cooIer this afternoon.

1097
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:10,448
CIear and coIder tonight
and tomorrow.

1098
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:17,295
- l`m sorry, Officer Ford,
we`re not open for business.

1099
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:19,164
- Well, that`s all right.

1100
01:04:19,202 --> 01:04:20,169
That`s all right, Max.

1101
01:04:20,203 --> 01:04:23,468
l just wanted to-

1102
01:04:23,506 --> 01:04:24,803
l just wanted to come by,

1103
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:28,436
and l`ve been meaning to come by
since that night,

1104
01:04:28,478 --> 01:04:30,969
and l wanted to just
tell you how sorry l am

1105
01:04:31,014 --> 01:04:34,245
and had there been anything
l could`ve done,

1106
01:04:34,284 --> 01:04:35,251
l would`ve done it.

1107
01:04:35,285 --> 01:04:36,912
You know that.

1108
01:04:36,953 --> 01:04:39,285
l`m sorry
that you`re closing down.

1109
01:04:39,322 --> 01:04:40,448
- l`m not closing.

1110
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:41,957
Why should l close?

1111
01:04:41,991 --> 01:04:43,925
Just remodeling it.

1112
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,053
Adding some new booths,
a new floor.

1113
01:04:46,095 --> 01:04:48,962
Just like Johnnie
would`ve liked it.

1114
01:04:51,134 --> 01:04:52,123
- Well, that`s right.

1115
01:04:59,676 --> 01:05:01,507
- Hurry up, Reggie.

1116
01:05:02,045 --> 01:05:03,410
- But remember the FIick
rear window sticker

1117
01:05:03,446 --> 01:05:06,938
can be the onIy contest sticker
of its kind on your car.

1118
01:05:09,652 --> 01:05:12,849
- [laughs]

1119
01:05:12,889 --> 01:05:14,447
- Did l do this?
- Mm-hmm.

1120
01:05:15,992 --> 01:05:19,291
- % If %

1121
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:24,926
% You wait for me %

1122
01:05:24,968 --> 01:05:28,267
% UntiI %

1123
01:05:28,304 --> 01:05:33,765
% I come back home %

1124
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:37,041

a little talk.

How many times you lay her?

that l have to lay whores.

man can live without, l suppose.

But what could be substitute

l wouldn`t be listening
to you now.

- Okay, let`s cut the bullshit.

1154
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:39,460
now, we both know
that Oonway`s looking

1155
01:07:39,502 --> 01:07:42,096
to pin Elmer`s murder
on someone,

1156
01:07:42,138 --> 01:07:45,938
and l`m just trying to make sure
that he doesn`t pin it on me.

1157
01:07:45,975 --> 01:07:48,569
- Why would he do that?

1158
01:07:48,611 --> 01:07:50,238
- Well, Oonway hates the union

1159
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:52,247
almost as much as l hate him.

1160

- Johnnie Pappas killed Elmer.

1161
01:07:57,754 --> 01:07:58,914
That`s why he hanged himself.

1162
01:08:00,623 --> 01:08:02,557

to Max Pappas?

1163

- l was.

1164
01:08:03,826 --> 01:08:05,453
- now, where do you suppose
he got the money

1165
01:08:05,495 --> 01:08:06,553
for that kind of remodeling?

1166
01:08:06,596 --> 01:08:09,292
- not my place to consider it.
- no.

Ohester Oonway`s jobbing
all the material.

1168
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,363
He`s paying off all the men.

1169
01:08:14,404 --> 01:08:17,965
l mean, no one`s seen
a nickel coming from Pappas.

1170
01:08:18,007 --> 01:08:19,770
l mean, doesn`t that strike you
as rather odd

1171
01:08:19,809 --> 01:08:21,174
that he`d be doing a job
for a man

1172
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:24,737
whose son killed his boy?

1173
01:08:24,781 --> 01:08:28,012
- Oonway takes all
the turnkey stuff he can get.

1174
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:30,143
Outs half a dozen profits
instead of one.

1175
01:08:30,186 --> 01:08:33,519
- Well, l suppose so.

1176
01:08:33,556 --> 01:08:35,387
So you been out
to Johnnie`s grave?

1177
01:08:35,425 --> 01:08:38,292
- no, l`m ashamed to say
l haven`t done that yet.

1178
01:08:38,327 --> 01:08:40,124
- Yeah, l bet.

1179
01:08:40,163 --> 01:08:42,597
You know,
he`s buried on sacred ground.

1180
01:08:42,632 --> 01:08:44,930
You know what that means, Lou?

1181
01:08:44,967 --> 01:08:47,492
- l reckon the church
didn`t call it a suicide.

1182
01:08:47,537 --> 01:08:48,561

1183

Do we have an answer?

1184
01:08:50,072 --> 01:08:53,838

that Elmer

1190

and the late occupant
of this cottage got it,

1191
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:23,167
one of my carpenters went to
the picture show at the Palace.

1192
01:09:23,206 --> 01:09:30,009
Parked his car around back
at around 9:30.

1193
01:09:30,046 --> 01:09:34,244
When he came back,
all four of his tires were gone.

1194
01:09:34,283 --> 01:09:35,648
- Well, that`s funny.

1195
01:09:35,685 --> 01:09:37,346
l didn`t hear anything about it.

1196
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:42,016
- lt`d been funny if you had,
Lou, `cause he didn`t report it.

1197
01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:43,491
But he did mention it
to one of the boys

1198
01:09:43,526 --> 01:09:44,959
at the Tuesday joiners` meeting,

1199
01:09:44,994 --> 01:09:47,428
and one of them, it turned out
bought two of the tires

1200
01:09:47,463 --> 01:09:50,023
from Johnnie Pappas.

1201
01:09:55,204 --> 01:09:57,138
You feelin` the chill, Lou?

1202
01:09:58,674 --> 01:10:00,141

for the night of the murders,

1207
01:10:13,155 --> 01:10:14,179
then he would`ve told me,

1208
01:10:14,223 --> 01:10:16,714
and he wouldn`t
have hanged himself.

1209
01:10:16,759 --> 01:10:18,386

1210

He liked you.

01:10:33,843 --> 01:10:34,832

l wouldn`t hang around.

01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,872
- [sighs]

1283
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:39,651
l don`t have much money.

1284
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:41,883
- Yeah.

1285
01:14:41,924 --> 01:14:44,654
Well, you got this place.

1286
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:47,787
Must be worth
a tidy little sum too.

1287
01:14:52,101 --> 01:14:54,433
- Maybe l could get a loan.

1288
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:56,802
- How long do you think
it would take to get this loan?

1289
01:14:56,839 --> 01:14:58,898
- Two weeks.

1290
01:15:06,348 --> 01:15:08,509
- $5,000.

1291
01:15:08,551 --> 01:15:12,647
$5,000 in two weeks.

1292
01:15:12,688 --> 01:15:16,556
5:00, two weeks from tonight,
and we`ll call that a deal.

1293
01:15:16,592 --> 01:15:20,221
And don`t worry, l ain`t a hog
about money or nothin`.

1294
01:15:20,262 --> 01:15:22,230
l get the $5,000,

1295
01:15:22,264 --> 01:15:24,095
that`s the last
we`ll ever see of each other.

1296
01:15:26,735 --> 01:15:30,296
- Well...

1297
01:15:30,339 --> 01:15:31,863
all right.

1298
01:15:36,212 --> 01:15:38,510
- Oh, and don`t you go
gettin` no notions

1299
01:15:38,547 --> 01:15:41,448
about running out on me.

1300
01:15:41,483 --> 01:15:43,110
- Do you think l`m crazy?

1301
01:15:44,887 --> 01:15:46,821
- You ask
an unpleasant question, bud,

1302
01:15:46,856 --> 01:15:48,790
you might get
an unpleasant answer.

1303
01:16:05,407 --> 01:16:08,171
- I went to work every
working day of those two weeks.

1304
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:09,575
- Morning, Jeff.

1305
01:16:09,612 --> 01:16:11,079
- Howdy, Lou.

1306
01:16:13,649 --> 01:16:15,583
- Chester Conway came
to taIk to Hendricks,

1307
01:16:15,618 --> 01:16:18,143
and I made it my job
to see him.

1308
01:16:18,187 --> 01:16:19,779
- Mr. Oonway.

1309
01:16:19,822 --> 01:16:21,153
- Lou.

1310
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:22,589
- l`d like to talk to you
for a second.

1311
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:23,592
- Mm-hmm.

1312
01:16:23,626 --> 01:16:25,059
What about?

1313
01:16:25,094 --> 01:16:27,119
- l should`ve gone out
with Elmer just like you said.

1314
01:16:27,162 --> 01:16:30,928
And if cussin` me out
will make you feel any better

1315
01:16:30,966 --> 01:16:32,092
or if you want my job,

1316
01:16:32,134 --> 01:16:33,965
Lord knows
you can have it.

1317
01:16:34,003 --> 01:16:37,302
l sure won`t hold a grudge.

1318
01:16:37,339 --> 01:16:38,397
- Elmer trusted you.

1319
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,567
l trusted you.

1320
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:45,137
- Appreciate that.

1321
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:47,375
- Hey, Lou.

1322
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:49,577
l think you`re gonna
like this one.

1323
01:16:49,618 --> 01:16:51,779
- Amy came to see me every day.

1324
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:55,187
She aIways brought some cake
or pie or somethin`.

1325
01:16:55,224 --> 01:16:57,249
And she had to take it
kind of easy when she sat down.

1326
01:17:08,771 --> 01:17:10,932
We`d sit outside
and have a drink,

1327
01:17:10,973 --> 01:17:12,702
and I`d think how much
she Iooked Iike her.

1328
01:17:15,177 --> 01:17:17,236
And afterwards,
she`d Iie in my arms,

1329
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:21,443
and I couId aImost fooI myseIf
into thinking it was her.

1330
01:17:21,483 --> 01:17:22,450
But it wasn`t her.

1331
01:17:22,484 --> 01:17:24,111
And for that matter,

1332
01:17:24,153 --> 01:17:26,951
it wouIdn`t have made
any difference if it had been.

1333
01:17:26,989 --> 01:17:29,355
I`d just be right back
where I started.

1334
01:17:31,293 --> 01:17:33,193
I took her everywhere
she wanted to go,

1335
01:17:33,228 --> 01:17:34,786
did everything
she wanted to do.

1336
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:36,161
It wasn`t any troubIe.

1337
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:39,224
She didn`t want to go much
or do much.

1338
01:17:39,268 --> 01:17:41,361
For the first time
in I don`t remember when,

1339
01:17:41,403 --> 01:17:43,735
my mind was reaIIy free.

1340
01:17:52,114 --> 01:17:54,207
I knew I had to kiII Amy.

1341
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:55,739
I couId put the reason
into words.

1342
01:17:55,784 --> 01:17:57,081
But every time
I thought about it,

1343
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:59,610
I had to stop
and think why again.

1344
01:17:59,655 --> 01:18:02,123
I`d be doing somethin`,
reading a book or somethin`,

1345
01:18:02,157 --> 01:18:03,784
and aII of a sudden,
it wouId come over me

1346
01:18:03,826 --> 01:18:05,487
that I was gonna kiII her,

1347
01:18:05,527 --> 01:18:09,793
and the idea seemed so crazy
that I`d aImost Iaugh out Ioud.

1348
01:18:09,832 --> 01:18:12,130
Then I`d start thinking,
and I`d see it,

1349
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:14,158
see that it had to be done.

1350
01:18:20,342 --> 01:18:22,674
Bob, Amy and me got somethin`
mighty important to do tonight,

1351
01:18:22,711 --> 01:18:24,679
and l`m gonna be out
Monday and Tuesday.

1352
01:18:24,713 --> 01:18:27,978
- Oh, well, now.

1353
01:18:28,017 --> 01:18:31,783
Well, now,
you don`t think maybe you-

1354
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,651
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

1355
01:18:33,689 --> 01:18:35,520
That`s good news, Lou.

1356
01:18:35,557 --> 01:18:36,649
That`s real good news.

1357
01:18:36,692 --> 01:18:39,820
l know you`re gonna be
happy together.

1358
01:18:39,862 --> 01:18:41,557
- l feel pretty lucky.

1359
01:18:41,597 --> 01:18:43,189
Feel like my life`s
a picture show.

1360
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:47,794
- They don`t come any better
than little Amy.

1361
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:51,462
Yes, sir.

1362
01:18:51,507 --> 01:18:52,997
Gonna be good.

Don`t say anything.

01:25:56,131 --> 01:25:59,464
Air smells real good.

1445
01:25:59,501 --> 01:26:03,460
lt`s been smelling real good,
anyways.

1446
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:08,865
- Where is everybody?

1447
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:10,775
l figured they`d come by.

1448
01:26:10,812 --> 01:26:14,179
- Told `em you wasn`t up to it.

1449
01:26:14,216 --> 01:26:17,344
Told `em you was all broke up
about Bob Maples.

1450
01:26:17,385 --> 01:26:19,285
- About Bob?

1451
01:26:19,321 --> 01:26:23,451
- Shot hisself last night
around midnight.

1452
01:26:23,492 --> 01:26:25,084
Yes, sir.

1453
01:26:25,126 --> 01:26:29,222
Poor ol` Bob killed hisself.

1454
01:26:29,264 --> 01:26:32,665
And l reckon l know
just how he felt.

1455
01:26:43,278 --> 01:26:44,677
- Sure you don`t want
a cup of coffee?

1456
01:26:44,713 --> 01:26:47,045
- no, thank you.

1457
01:27:03,598 --> 01:27:08,160
- Last night`s events,
these recent events,

1458
01:27:08,203 --> 01:27:09,795
l don`t like `em one bit.

1459
01:27:09,838 --> 01:27:12,102
- Well, that`s only natural,
Howard.

1460
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:14,108
l don`t see how you could.

1461
01:27:14,142 --> 01:27:15,973
l mean, l don`t like `em
one bit, either.

1462
01:27:16,011 --> 01:27:19,913
- Well, now, take this drifter,

1463
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:23,782
this alleged robber rapist
that you`d have us believe

1464
01:27:23,818 --> 01:27:26,412
robbed and raped Miss Stanton.

1465
01:27:26,454 --> 01:27:29,218
We know he didn`t do it.

1466
01:27:29,257 --> 01:27:30,349
He`s a pipeline worker.

1467
01:27:30,392 --> 01:27:32,087
He had a pocket full of wages.

1468
01:27:32,127 --> 01:27:34,994
You`re not gonna get away
with planting that money on him.

1469
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:36,156
- What money?

1470
01:27:36,197 --> 01:27:38,722
- The money you stole
from Elmer Oonway.

1471
01:27:38,767 --> 01:27:40,564
The money you stole
the night you killed him

1472
01:27:40,602 --> 01:27:41,569
and that whore Lakeland.

1473
01:27:41,603 --> 01:27:42,900
- Why would l kill
Joyce Lakeland?

1474
01:27:42,938 --> 01:27:44,235
- `Oause you killed
Elmer Oonway.

1475
01:27:44,272 --> 01:27:45,466
You had to shut her up.

1476
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:48,302
- Why would l kill Elmer Oonway?

1477
01:27:48,343 --> 01:27:49,503
l`ve known him all my life.

1478
01:27:49,544 --> 01:27:51,273
- You killed him;
you killed Joyce Lakeland;

1479
01:27:51,313 --> 01:27:52,575
you hanged Johnnie Pappas.

1480
01:27:52,614 --> 01:27:55,014
- Howard, you`re not
making any sense.

1481
01:27:55,050 --> 01:27:56,950
- You killed Johnnie Pappas
to protect yourself.

1482
01:27:56,985 --> 01:27:59,249
You`d given him
that marked $20 bill.

1483
01:27:59,287 --> 01:28:01,278
- How much money went missing?

1484
01:28:01,323 --> 01:28:03,655
$500?

1485
01:28:03,692 --> 01:28:05,819
You`re saying that l killed
Elmer Oonway for $500?

1486
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:07,589
- l`m saying Johnnie Pappas
wasn`t anywhere

1487
01:28:07,629 --> 01:28:08,823
near the scene of those murders.

1488
01:28:08,863 --> 01:28:09,830
- l never believed that.

1489
01:28:09,864 --> 01:28:11,229
- He was stealing tires
at the time.

1490
01:28:11,266 --> 01:28:13,860
- Johnnie Pappas was my friend.

1491
01:28:13,902 --> 01:28:16,928
That was your theory.

1492
01:28:16,972 --> 01:28:21,033
- You think you got it
all figured out, don`t ya?

1493
01:28:21,076 --> 01:28:23,601
Four, five murders.

1494
01:28:23,645 --> 01:28:25,510
Six if you count
poor Bob Maples,

1495
01:28:25,547 --> 01:28:27,538
staked everything he had on ya.

1496
01:28:27,582 --> 01:28:31,313
And you just sit there
explainin` and smilin`.

1497
01:28:31,353 --> 01:28:36,188
You ain`t bothered one bit.

1498
01:28:36,224 --> 01:28:38,283
How can you do it, Ford?

1499
01:28:38,326 --> 01:28:40,055
How can you just sit there
and do that?

1500
01:28:40,095 --> 01:28:42,529
- Well, somebody`s got to keep
their head around here.

1501
01:28:46,034 --> 01:28:47,160
Any more questions?

1502
01:28:47,202 --> 01:28:49,602
- Yeah, l got one.

1503
01:28:49,638 --> 01:28:54,200
- Shoot.

1504
01:28:54,242 --> 01:28:56,802
- How did Miss Stanton
get those bruises on her body?

1505
01:28:56,845 --> 01:28:58,403
Old bruises,
not made last night.

1506
01:28:58,446 --> 01:29:01,176
Same kind of bruises we found
on the Lakeland woman`s body.

1507
01:29:01,216 --> 01:29:04,151
How do you think she got them,
Lou?

1508
01:29:04,185 --> 01:29:06,585
- Oh, gosh Howard,
you got me there.

1509
01:29:06,621 --> 01:29:07,645
How would l know?

1510
01:29:07,689 --> 01:29:08,815
- You`d been beatin` on her

1511
01:29:08,857 --> 01:29:11,325
just like you
beat on that whore.

1512
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:15,853
- So l was beatin` on Amy,
and she kept right on seeing me?

1513
01:29:15,897 --> 01:29:20,960
l was bruisin` her up,
and she was fixin` to marry me?

1514
01:29:21,002 --> 01:29:22,435
Boy, you didn`t know
Amy Stanton.

1515
01:29:25,974 --> 01:29:27,339
- Maybe you didn`t know
Amy Stanton

1516
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:28,501
as well as you thought you did.

1517
01:29:28,543 --> 01:29:29,840
- ls that right?

1518
01:29:29,878 --> 01:29:32,210
- This was in her purse.

1519
01:29:32,247 --> 01:29:33,976
Apparently she intended to
have you stop

1520
01:29:34,015 --> 01:29:36,882
at some restaurant down the road
and have you read it.

1521
01:29:36,918 --> 01:29:40,081
now it begins, ``Lou Darling.``
- Let me have it.

1522
01:29:40,121 --> 01:29:41,554
- l`ll read it.
- lt`s his letter.

1523
01:29:41,589 --> 01:29:42,681
Let him have it.

1524
01:29:44,826 --> 01:29:45,884
- Very well.

1525
01:29:54,135 --> 01:29:55,796
- ``Lou DarIing...

1526
01:29:55,837 --> 01:29:57,634
``Now you know why
I had you stop here

1527
01:29:57,672 --> 01:30:00,402
``and why I`ve excused myseIf
from the tabIe.

1528
01:30:00,442 --> 01:30:02,467
``It was to aIIow you
to read this,

1529
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:05,673
``the things I couIdn`t
somehow otherwise say to you.

1530
01:30:05,714 --> 01:30:07,739
``Lou, I beg you,
pIease, pIease,

1531
01:30:07,782 --> 01:30:10,751
``pIease not to take it
the wrong way.

1532
01:30:10,785 --> 01:30:12,719
``But I`m afraid.

1533
01:30:12,754 --> 01:30:15,120
``Are you in troubIe?

1534
01:30:15,156 --> 01:30:17,056
``Now, I don`t want to ask you
more than that,

1535
01:30:17,092 --> 01:30:19,617
``but I do want you to beIieve
that whatever it is,

1536
01:30:19,661 --> 01:30:21,094
``even if it`s what I-

1537
01:30:21,129 --> 01:30:23,859
``whatever it is, Lou,
I`m on your side.

1538
01:30:23,898 --> 01:30:25,627
``I Iove you.

1539
01:30:25,667 --> 01:30:27,658
``Are you tired of
my saying that?

1540
01:30:27,702 --> 01:30:30,637
``I know you`d never knowingIy
do anything wrong.

1541
01:30:30,672 --> 01:30:33,163
``So even if it shouId invoIve
being separated for a whiIe,

1542
01:30:33,208 --> 01:30:35,642
``a Iong whiIe, Iet`s-

1543
01:30:35,677 --> 01:30:40,341
``weII, we`II make it aII right,
you and I together.

1544
01:30:40,381 --> 01:30:44,784
``If you`II onIy teII me,
if you`II just Iet me heIp you.

1545
01:30:44,819 --> 01:30:46,377
``I hope that when I

1546
01:30:46,421 --> 01:30:47,979

1547
01:30:48,022 --> 01:30:50,115

1549
01:30:52,794 --> 01:30:54,022

1550
01:30:54,062 --> 01:30:57,554

1554

AIways and forever,
Amy. ``

1555
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:15,606
- She was so damn talkie,
wasn`t she?

1556
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:17,015
l mean, just the sweetest thing,

1557
01:31:17,051 --> 01:31:19,019
but just talk a fencepost
right out of a field.

1558
01:31:19,053 --> 01:31:20,111
- You dirty son of a bitch.

1559
01:31:20,155 --> 01:31:21,213
- Don`t say that to me.

1560
01:31:21,256 --> 01:31:22,518
- no, don`t say that.

1561
01:31:22,557 --> 01:31:24,582
Don`t never say anything
about a man`s mother.

1562
01:31:24,626 --> 01:31:25,923
- To hell with that crap.

1563
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:27,427
You killed that little girl.

1564
01:31:27,462 --> 01:31:31,023
She as good as says so.

1565
01:31:31,065 --> 01:31:36,901
- She wrote it down
after l killed her?

1566
01:31:36,938 --> 01:31:38,496
That`s quite a trick, Howard.

1567
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:40,235
- You killed them, Ford.

1568
01:31:40,275 --> 01:31:42,505
You killed them all.

1569
01:31:50,451 --> 01:31:52,715
- Know what that thing is
right there?

1570
01:31:52,754 --> 01:31:54,187
Over by Jeff?

1571
01:31:54,222 --> 01:31:55,689
lt`s called a door.

1572
01:31:55,723 --> 01:31:58,214
now, l can`t think of a thing
to keep you

1573
01:31:58,259 --> 01:32:00,284
and Mr. Plummer
from walking through it.

1574
01:32:00,328 --> 01:32:03,195
- l sure liked Bob Maples.

1575
01:32:03,231 --> 01:32:05,290
l sure liked
that little Miss Amy.

1576
01:32:05,333 --> 01:32:07,426
- Why don`t you close that door
behind you real careful?

1577
01:32:07,468 --> 01:32:08,662
l`m still suffering from shock.

1578
01:32:08,703 --> 01:32:12,002
- Jeff.

1579
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:13,667
- You right sure
you ain`t comin` with us?

1580
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:17,075
You don`t reckon
you could change your mind?

1581
01:32:19,514 --> 01:32:20,742
- They put me down in the cooIer

1582
01:32:20,782 --> 01:32:22,943
where Johnnie Pappas
had kiIIed himseIf.

1583
01:32:22,984 --> 01:32:25,111
And they kept me there
for a week.

1584
01:32:25,153 --> 01:32:26,882
I guess they thought
that`d break me.

1585
01:32:26,921 --> 01:32:29,185
But it didn`t,
just gave me time to think.

1586
01:32:30,992 --> 01:32:32,254
On the eighth day,

1587
01:32:32,293 --> 01:32:34,693
they transferred me
to the insane asyIum.

1588
01:32:34,729 --> 01:32:36,526
I didn`t see that comin`.

1589
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:45,564
No one tried to push me around
or even questioned me there.

1590
01:32:45,607 --> 01:32:49,338
I tried to teII myseIf
that was a good sign.

1591
01:32:49,377 --> 01:32:50,935
But in my heart I knew.

1592
01:32:50,979 --> 01:32:54,745
I knew they must have
some evidence.

1593
01:33:37,792 --> 01:33:40,056
- Morning, Mr. Ford.

1594
01:33:40,094 --> 01:33:42,062
- Will they be playing
the pictures again tonight?

1595
01:33:42,096 --> 01:33:43,324
- Excuse me?

1596
01:33:43,364 --> 01:33:44,888
- Would you tell `em

a plain waste of time.

at that college, Mr. Ford,

that was ever any use to me.

than the people in the saddle
