1
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,729
Don't stress. Just relax.

2
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,592
I understand you can lose keys.

3
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,359
You can lose your wallet.
How do you lose a plane?

4
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,264
Reese, what do you want me to do?

5
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,634
We got three out of four planes in.
That's a lot of coke.

6
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:18,073
Now, that's the kind of winning attitude
that'll take this enterprise to the top.

7
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,735
In all fairness, Reese, it wasn't his fault.

8
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,883
Are you his attorney?
Why are you in the conversation?

9
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,650
Come on, I'm kidding!

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,445
- I'm just kidding with you.
- He loves to joke.

11
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:34,150
Terrence here is absolutely right.
I mean, hell, three out of four ain't bad.

12
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,621
Let's celebrate. Who wants a beer?

13
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,162
- Great!
- Okay.

14
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,803
- Baby!
- Coke. It costs money.

15
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,432
Planes. They cost money.

16
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:54,044
This yacht, this perm, my kid's braces, it all
costs money. Do you think Kitty's free?

17
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,307
Kitty, turn around. Turn around!

18
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,643
Reese, please put the gun down.

19
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,795
Now, the next time that a plane
goes down, you better be on it.

20
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,433
Will you do my back, please?

21
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,496
- Sure.
- I don't wanna tan weird.

22
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,931
- Am I tanning weird?
- No.

23
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,503
- Honestly.
- You're bronzing.

24
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,250
There's no such thing
as a petty crime.

25
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:35,279
No minor infractions.

26
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,047
There's only the law.

27
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,557
Freeze! Bay City P.D.!

28
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,488
That's me in the leather jacket
and tight jeans.

29
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,834
See that guy I'm chasing?
I hate him.

30
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,438
And I'll do everything
in my power to stop him.

31
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,506
Wanna play, let's play.

32
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,439
Because it's my job to stop him.

33
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,173
Goddamn!

34
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,841
And the city pays me a damn
good salary to do my job.

35
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,889
Besides, he crossed the line.

36
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,587
And in Bay City,
when you cross the line...

37
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,762
...your nuts are mine.

38
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,692
I said, freeze!

39
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,100
My name is David Starsky,
and I'm a cop.

40
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,474
I've always had this theory
about police work:

41
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,775
If you can't beat them, join them.

42
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,782
No! No! No!

43
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,190
Put the money in there.

44
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,760
Too many cops worry about
the wrong thing: Crime.

45
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,732
Not me, though.
I'm looking out for numero uno.

46
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:02,432
- Hey, old-timer. Put this on Dallas.
- Come on! Let's go!

47
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,501
I'm just a realist, that's all.

48
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:11,013
And besides, you have any idea
how little the city pays us?

49
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,583
Freeze! Bay City P.D.!

50
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,615
Take it easy.

51
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:21,786
Guys, come on.
I'm undercover here.

52
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,830
My name is Ken Hutchinson,
and I'm a cop.

53
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,397
Where did they come from?

54
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,774
Jesus Christ, Starsky.

55
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,642
You fired three rounds
into a crowded intersection.

56
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,544
We got a man with a broken hip...

57
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,743
...and some asshole wants
a new top for his Caddy?

58
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,649
That purse had $ 7 in it.

59
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,424
- Okay, want my badge? Here, take it.
- Fine.

60
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,557
Come on. I was just making a point.

61
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,291
David, David.

62
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,871
Your mother was one of the finest cops
Bay City ever seen.

63
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,938
Twenty-two years on the force
with the same partner.

64
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:15,877
You have had 12 partners
over the past four years.

65
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,241
She died a legend.

66
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,012
I am not my mother!

67
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:26,518
I'm sorry.
Detective Hutchinson is here.

68
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,523
Send him in. Have a seat.

69
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,665
- How you doing, captain?
- I believe you two know each other.

70
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,030
Yeah, a little bit. How you doing?

71
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,235
- Yeah, right.
- Hutch.

72
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,075
You've got a lot of explaining to do.

73
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:46,973
I know. Look, I was trying to infiltrate
one of the East Side gangs...

74
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,808
...and work my way up
to the big fish. It's simple.

75
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,314
- You were robbing a bookie.
- That's right.

76
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,316
You've robbed seven bookies.

77
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:58,583
You haven't filed a report, turned
in any money or arrested anybody.

78
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,555
How can I? They'll know I'm a cop.

79
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,890
I wouldn't worry, you won't
be mistaken for a real cop.

80
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:09,660
Oh, really? Why don't you go get yourself
another perm and let the grownups talk.

81
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,498
- My hair is naturally curly.
- No, it's not.

82
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,004
- Yes, it is.
- That's a perm job, all the way.

83
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,801
Touch it!

84
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,205
Hey! Why are you touching him?

85
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,247
Jesus!

86
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,977
You know something?

87
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,590
You two deserve each other.

88
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,686
Make nice. You're partners.

89
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,129
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

90
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,065
I don't know why you're so upset.

91
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,730
The guy cost us 200 grand.
A "thank you" might be more appropriate.

92
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,435
Who cares about 200 grand?
What if they link us to the murder?

93
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,547
- They won't link us to the murder.
- You don't know that.

94
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,945
Will you let it go, please? Jesus.

95
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,018
- Take a lude. Calm down.
- I did, and I'm still pissed.

96
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:04,020
Okay, fine. Fine, fine.
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

97
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,024
I promise, I'm not gonna kill Terrence
again. Now, pull it together.

98
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,957
Let's go.

99
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,891
Gentlemen, I apologize
about the delay.

100
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,927
But I promise you what we have
is worth the wait.

101
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,930
- It looks like cocaine.
- That's because it is cocaine.

102
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,674
With a twist. You see,
we've managed to find a way...

103
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,906
...to alter the cell structure
of the coca plant...

104
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:33,108
...giving it a heightened
perfluoralkylation process...

105
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,983
...creating a new kind
of diazomethane.

106
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,258
Gets a little complicated after that.

107
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,956
Excuse me.

108
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,319
So do you get extra high or what?

109
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:48,361
Actually, it has all the same
effects as regular cocaine.

110
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,869
Well, if it's the same,
why are we here?

111
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,364
Canis familiaris. The German shepherd.

112
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,942
Its nose has over
220 million scent receptors.

113
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:03,343
It can detect smells that even the most
advanced technology in the world cannot.

114
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,177
For example:

115
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,479
Lvan, search!

116
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,557
Lvan, stop!

117
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,825
What do you got? You holding?

118
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,704
He brought old coke.

119
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,111
This is new coke.

120
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:40,577
As far as a dog's concerned, there's nothing
there. 100 percent undetectable cocaine.

121
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,653
Got no coke smell...

122
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,756
...same coke ride.

123
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,153
Tastes kind of sweet.

124
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,194
If this shit wasn't illegal, guys,
we'd be up for the Nobel Prize.

125
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,327
Our initial run pumped out
two tons of this stuff...

126
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,060
...and it'll be available
in about three weeks.

127
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,365
You boys know who to call.

128
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,540
Ivan!

129
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,678
You don't understand.

130
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,840
They're not like you.

131
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,178
They're criminals.

132
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,421
Look, I know we all
got to make living.

133
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,889
But these guys, they are dealing
hard drugs right in front of my shop.

134
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,996
I can dig what you're saying,
Mr. Chowdury.

135
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,566
- I wanna thank you for coming in today.
- Of course.

136
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:35,164
Those gentlemen you speak of,
they'll no longer be a problem.

137
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,706
You have my word.

138
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,573
This is my neighborhood.
People tend to forget that.

139
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,812
Bee Bee, make sure
he gets home safely.

140
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:48,181
- Yeah, boss.
- Thank you very much, Huggy.

141
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,383
You are a great man.

142
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:54,090
- Begone, little Indian.
- Let's go, little man. Come on.

143
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:56,393
Taking up time.

144
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:01,064
- This neighborhood is in need of some help.
- It's cold-blooded, daddy.

145
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,134
- Who's next?
- You got Hutch waiting outside.

146
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:08,831
- What you got my man waiting outside for?
- He brought some extra fuzz with him.

147
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:12,500
So what? You go get him
and get him in here now.

148
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,013
You've never run an errand
on the clock before?

149
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:20,778
I take care of my personal business after
work, when the taxpayers aren't paying me.

150
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,150
Give me a break. You've never
stopped to buy a cup of coffee?

151
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,086
I bring a Thermos.

152
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,461
Okay, Hutch. He'll see you now.

153
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,191
Wait here, I'll be back in five minutes.

154
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,535
Second door on the right.

155
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,243
- How you doing?
- Hi, Hutch.

156
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,478
- Hey, look what the wind blew in.
- Huggy Bear.

157
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,490
Hey, I want you to meet
my new partner, David Starsky.

158
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,560
Hey, how you doing?

159
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,687
Hey, nobody touches the Bear.

160
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,693
Have a seat.

161
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,563
- Hutch, the usual?
- You know it. Make it a double.

162
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,363
Get my boy a Jack and Tab.

163
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,699
- And double that.
- You got it, boss.

164
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:18,742
- I'll get a seltzer with lime, if you got it.
- I don't got it.

165
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,707
Or not. It's cool. I'm good.

166
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,941
I just came by to apologize
for what happened in Chinatown.

167
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,608
Let me tell you,
I was as surprised as you were.

168
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,914
Don't sweat it, baby.
I wasn't surprised.

169
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,818
You know I ain't never surprised.

170
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,950
Hey, champ.

171
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,153
You got a permit for that weapon
you're carrying?

172
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,059
Starsky, please.

173
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,928
No, I don't.

174
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,500
Yeah, me neither.

175
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,038
I'm sorry, did I say something
that was funny?

176
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,045
- Stop it. He's kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.

177
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,740
I wanna see permits
or I'm taking those weapons.

178
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,614
Slow up, man.
Around here, we govern ourselves.

179
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,449
Think of us like Luxembourg.

180
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,284
- You dig?
- No, I don't dig.

181
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,925
See, Luxembourg's
a constitutional monarchy...

182
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,531
...a sovereign state established
after the Treaty of Vienna.

183
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:17,192
Technically, it's a part of Europe.
But in reality, they govern themselves.

184
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,099
- Like us.
- Just like us.

185
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,075
All right, enough, okay?

186
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,609
- Shit!
- Hold up! Hold up!

187
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,807
Just chill out! Chill!
Watch yourself.

188
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,952
- Oh, no. Hell, no.
- You okay?

189
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,849
What happened?
Did he shoot Corky?

190
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,955
Your boy shot his tail off.

191
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,922
- He lost his tail?
- You should keep it in a terrarium.

192
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,128
- Man, what the hell is a terrarium?
- What's a terrarium?

193
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:48,494
It's an artificial ecosystem designed
to simulate Corky's natural habitat.

194
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,770
Well, I can dig that.
But I say we shoot him in the ass.

195
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,633
Oh, hell, yeah.
An eye for an eye.

196
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,775
Take it easy.
Huggy, help me out here.

197
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,241
Slow up, fellas. An iguana can lose
his tail and grow it back.

198
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,939
He regenerates.
That's how he escapes his predator.

199
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,608
It's true. It's a defense mechanism.
I read it in a magazine.

200
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:13,485
So him shooting Corky's tail off
and us shooting him in the ass...

201
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,686
...it really ain't the same thing.
- No, the punishment don't fit the crime.

202
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,093
And besides,
it was an accident, right?

203
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,461
Right.

204
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,963
- So we're cool.
- We're always cool, breeze.

205
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,231
Lower your pieces.

206
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:37,781
Good morning, Bay City, you are tuned
in to KBA Y, 93.3 on your dial.

207
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,216
This next tune is number eight on
the charts and number one in our hearts.

208
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,665
Hey, Hutch!

209
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,926
Oh, there he is.
What's going on, Willis?

210
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,662
Same old, same old.

211
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,637
So how's life at the clink
treating you?

212
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,438
It's not that great.

213
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:42,445
I got some new tight-ass partner
that they stuck me with and then...

214
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:46,107
I don't know. Hopefully...
It's probably not gonna last that long.

215
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:50,121
- So got that $20 you owe me?
- 20?

216
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,382
Willis, I thought it was 5.

217
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,049
Hutch, that was my grandmother's
birthday money.

218
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,890
Come on, give me a break, okay?
I just told you I got a new partner.

219
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:03,933
Stuff isn't great for me down at the
precinct. You know, back off for a second.

220
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:09,734
- Can I get it to you on Thursday?
- Fine, but no later than Thursday.

221
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,070
No later than Thursday.
Word of honor.

222
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,440
Cute little kid.

223
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,957
It's 10:00. You're late.
I've been here since 8.

224
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,986
8:00? I didn't know this place opened at 8.

225
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:37,363
Well, don't sweat it, because crime called
in sick. It's gonna get a late start too.

226
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,571
"Crime called in sick," I like that.

227
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:45,638
- So, what's on the agenda today?
- Same as every day.

228
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:49,747
- Finding bad guys, bringing them down.
- Great. Take my car, right there.

229
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,843
- That?
- Yeah.

230
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:55,316
- What the hell is that?
- It's like a camper/pickup truck.

231
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,455
- What's the matter?
- We're undercover.

232
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,024
- That thing sticks out like a sore thumb.
- You think so?

233
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,227
You're in for a treat.

234
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,457
It's not that bad.

235
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,245
Man, your stock just went up
in my book, my friend.

236
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,721
Pop the hood. Let's see
what you got under...

237
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:38,454
Hotshot, what do you think you're doing?
This is a Ford Gran Torino, okay?

238
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,157
It's not some crappy camper/apartment.
There are rules.

239
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,894
- Okay, okay.
- You do not bang on the hood.

240
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,800
You never, under any circumstances, drive.

241
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,635
You will not put your coffee mug
on the roof. Okay?

242
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:55,337
No coffee in the car whatsoever. Coffee
on the ground, you get in the car, we go.

243
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:06,722
Attention, all units.
We've got a 61-40 at Bay City Marina.

244
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,325
Oh, no.

245
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,652
This is Zebra 3.
We're on it. Hang on.

246
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,865
You gotta be kidding me. No way.

247
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,032
- What?
- Floater.

248
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,339
Nothing harder to solve than a floater.
No prints, body's usually bloated...

249
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:32,712
...it's next to impossible.
All right, I say we push it out...

250
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,410
...hope the current
takes it to the next precinct.

251
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,782
- What?
- You'll thank me for this one.

252
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,819
- Hey, seriously, stop it.
- The key is not to pop it.

253
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,791
- Hey.
- You gotta be very ginger.

254
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:47,557
- What are you doing?
- I said, drop the stick.

255
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,531
You point a gun at me?
Okay, fine, have it your way.

256
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,135
Knock yourself out.

257
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,740
- What are you gonna solve, anyway?
- I'm gonna solve a murder.

258
00:17:56,942 --> 00:18:00,969
Monday, June 3rd. Male Caucasian body,
apparently dumped from the Bay Bridge.

259
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:05,344
Actually, there's no sign of impact,
so he was probably just dropped out at sea.

260
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,917
Could you please not talk
while I'm recording?

261
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,554
Thank you.

262
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,286
All right, I'm just gonna call
in the meat wagon, all right?

263
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,590
Looks like you punched
your last ticket, amigo.

264
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,557
I'm sorry, did you just tough-talk
a dead body?

265
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,429
I lost my flow.

266
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:31,874
- Zebra 3 to base.
- Dispatch. Go ahead, Zebra 3.

267
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:36,071
We're gonna need a coroner notification.
We got a DB down at municipal jetty.

268
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,715
10-4, will inform.

269
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,216
Tell them to bring a body bag
and some galoshes. He's a wet one.

270
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,286
Copy that, Starsky.

271
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:47,423
Found a wallet.
Nothing in it.

272
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,423
- Medium-rare, okay?
- You got it.

273
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,927
Look at all these cops.
You wanna eat here?

274
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,497
It's a great place.
Pop's? Come on.

275
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,066
"If you're one of the cops,
eat at Pop's."

276
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,994
- Okay, hot stuff.
- Zebra 3.

277
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,162
2- 11 in progress, please respond.

278
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,137
- Go for Starsky.
- Hurry, Starsky.

279
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,709
We got two perps holding up
a gumball machine on 5th Street.

280
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,177
- Let's go.
- A gumball machine?

281
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,612
- Lethal force if necessary!

282
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,183
Very funny, Manetti.

283
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,688
Hey, it's Captain and Tennille.

284
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,883
That means one of you would
actually have to make captain.

285
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:25,961
- Radio's for police business only.
- That's true. Why'd they give you one?

286
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,264
- Let's get out of here.
- Not that funny.

287
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,628
That Manetti really thinks he's something.
But you know what?

288
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,796
- He's not.
- Take it easy.

289
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:42,079
- You think that's funny?
- No, no, I mean, you just gotta rise above it.

290
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,442
- What do we got in the wallet?
- Not much.

291
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:49,883
Driver's license, couple receipts.
No cash whatsoever.

292
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,456
"Reese Feldman Corporation."

293
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,389
What do you call that?

294
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,332
Terrence Meyers.

295
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,497
That name does sound vaguely familiar.

296
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,735
- Isn't he part of our Nearly There program?
- I think he is.

297
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:17,044
Terrence Meyers. Baby, isn't he
the guy dating a Bay City Kitty?

298
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,578
Remember?
We were joking about it.

299
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,345
Really? Bay City Kitty.
You mean the cheerleaders.

300
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,580
You happen to remember her name?

301
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,424
No, I don't.

302
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,792
- Can I get you boys anything else?
- We're good. Thank you so much, honey.

303
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,960
That's my angel. I love her.

304
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:40,264
A second ago you mentioned
the Nearly There Foundation. What is that?

305
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,704
That's a program that we set up
to help ex-cons get back on their feet.

306
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:48,243
Their parole requires them to have a job.
The Catch-22...

307
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,109
...is not that many people
are excited to hire a felon.

308
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,683
Those poor ex-cons,
they can't catch a break.

309
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,377
No, it's a vicious cycle
they get caught up in.

310
00:20:56,555 --> 00:21:00,958
- Did you see the article in The New Times?
- Bet your ass I did. I love that writer.

311
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:05,153
But I'd be lying if I didn't say that we
get some pretty good tax breaks too.

312
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,592
There it is, the kicker.

313
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,063
- Just a perk.
- This sly dog here.

314
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,230
- What do you got?
- Tickets to our annual fundraiser.

315
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,032
- Be my guests.
- No, we can't accept gratuities.

316
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,697
It's against policy.

317
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:21,141
These don't look like gratuities, they look
like tickets. I'd be happy to accept.

318
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,515
Hey, what about Terrence?
Is he in some kind of trouble?

319
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,885
He's dead. His body washed up
in the marina this morning.

320
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,281
Oh, no.

321
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:33,450
"Punched his last ticket," as they say.

322
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:38,727
You know, you try to do all you can for
these guys, but it's just never enough, is it?

323
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,125
No, I guess it isn't.

324
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,427
- When was the last time you saw him?
- The last place I saw...

325
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,594
This is a nice boat.

326
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:49,002
- Reese, is this yours?
- Actually, that's a yacht.

327
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,165
- I'm sorry, a yacht.
- Excuse me, Hutch.

328
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,743
Can we please focus
on the investigation?

329
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,106
- Sure.
- Thank you.

330
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,743
I could use another one of these.

331
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,807
Right on! That was great, girls!
Take five!

332
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,214
- Let's go.
- Look alive. Here they come.

333
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,354
We usually don't allow spectators.
Even cute ones.

334
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,317
David Starsky, Bay City P.D.
My partner, Ken Hutchinson.

335
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,087
- Girls.
- They're so cute.

336
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,590
I'm Stacey. That's Holly.

337
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,395
God, I loved your moves out there.
Fantastic.

338
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,369
I've never dated a cop before.

339
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,030
My horoscope said I should
try new things today.

340
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,769
- Is that right?
- You're awful.

341
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:03,779
So, what brings you around here,
officers?

342
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,244
Well, you know, that depends.

343
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,410
Yeah. Either of you two know
a Terrence Meyers?

344
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,454
- Oh, yeah, Heather dated him.
- Oh, yeah.

345
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:16,958
The girl over there with the yellow top.
But they split up. We haven't seen him.

346
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,654
- Let's go ask Heather some questions.
- Thank you.

347
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:22,561
Be careful with those moves.
You could hurt someone.

348
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,258
Oh, that's why we practice.

349
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,569
Actually, I was talking about us.

350
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,976
Where did that come from?

351
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:35,011
- I would've tried the horoscope line.
- No, too obvious.

352
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,408
Hey!

353
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,708
- Wait up.
- See what I mean?

354
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:44,611
- Here's my number.
- In case you need us for...

355
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,523
...questioning.

356
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,022
Thank you, ladies.

357
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,922
- Bye.
- Bye.

358
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:53,560
He was always fascinated
by all that macho mobster bullshit.

359
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,233
I hope this is okay.
I need to make this quick.

360
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:59,427
- I gotta pick my kid up in 20 minutes.
- Oh, yeah, totally.

361
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,539
We were gonna move in together.
He promised he'd quit...

362
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,436
...that stuff after he got out.

363
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,136
But then he goes and gets himself killed.
He's such an asshole.

364
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:14,143
I can only imagine what you must
be going through. I think that...

365
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:18,751
Honestly, you know, if I knew what
he was up to, I'd be happy to tell you.

366
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:21,358
But we didn't talk much.

367
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,290
Yeah. So did you...?

368
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,425
When did he...? Did he...?
What did...?

369
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:35,331
- So Hutch, do you got any more questions?
- Yeah, well, sure. We could...

370
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,498
What's your sign?

371
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,307
Gemini.

372
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,713
What...

373
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,612
- What do you weigh?
- What does that have to do with anything?

374
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:50,983
It has everything to do with anything.
Just answer the question, please, ma'am.

375
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:59,086
Around 115, I guess,
give or take a pound or two.

376
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:03,223
- I wish I could be more helpful.
- Stop.

377
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:08,566
Don't do that. You've been great. I mean,
it's terrific. We got what we needed.

378
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,998
Anything else?

379
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,945
- I'm good.
- Yeah.

380
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,411
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

381
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:21,814
Oh, wait. I don't know if this
will be of any help. It's his.

382
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,455
Take it. I don't want it.

383
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:29,991
Okay. Thank you. Again.

384
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:38,632
- Things getting any better at work, Hutch?
- Actually, work was pretty good today.

385
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,067
- How about you? Anything new?
- Nope.

386
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,901
You get a chance to ask that girl out?

387
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,700
I want you to meet
my new partner, David Starsky.

388
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,106
Nice to meet you.

389
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:50,880
Is this the dickweed
you were telling me about?

390
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,279
Look, just shake his hand.
Come on.

391
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,456
Go on, hop in. Willis.

392
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,148
- Dickweed?
- His mom works late on Wednesdays...

393
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,123
...so I kind of look after him.

394
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:07,823
- You take a kid out on patrol with you?
- Yeah, that's what we do, isn't it, Willis?

395
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:11,628
- Patrol!
- Whatever you say, Hutch.

396
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,428
Damn!

397
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:25,210
- Man, this thing is bad!
- Don't encourage him.

398
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,682
Oh, shit.

399
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,949
Starsky, this your ride?

400
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:38,791
Damn. You just moved up
a notch in my book.

401
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,625
That puts you at notch one.

402
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,767
- I like your Lincoln.
- It's a '76. It won't be out till next year.

403
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,906
I know people that know people
that robbed some people.

404
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,842
So, what do you hear
on the street these days?

405
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:58,877
Dig this. A little bird tells me there's
gonna be a big coke deal in Bay City.

406
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:03,077
- One for the Guinness Books, so they say.
- Interesting.

407
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:07,452
- Who would this little bird be?
- Look, I lay it out for y'all to play it out.

408
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,661
All right. What does that mean?

409
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:14,629
- Don't worry about it.
- Huggy, what can you tell us about this?

410
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,238
This looks like the work of Big Earl.

411
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:26,002
This boy loves dragons.
He makes these with his hands, you know?

412
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,979
There's his name stitched right up
under the dragon's belly.

413
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:34,050
- Big Earl?
- Yeah, he sews, but he's one tough mother.

414
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:37,188
He owns a biker bar about
80 miles east of Route 4.

415
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,487
Biker bar?
What goes on down there?

416
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,393
I don't know. Listen to Jim Croce...

417
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,655
...play darts, whatever the hell else
you white people do.

418
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,289
Look, fuzz, I gots to buzz.
This meeting is adjourned.

419
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,793
- That's it?
- That's it.

420
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:57,499
- He lays it out for us to play it out.
- Oh, and by the way, this little meeting?

421
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,042
- It never happened.
- What meeting?

422
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,974
C'est la vie, gentlemen.

423
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,882
- Great new technique
where you press hard.

424
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,319
- Hands. What, it's a verbal technique?
- No.

425
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,549
Keep your hands on me, I'm teasing.

426
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,590
- What do you got on those cops?
- Everything.

427
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:20,822
- Records, home addresses, credit history.
- Nice.

428
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:25,394
- Starsky and Hutchinson?
- They call him Hutch, actually.

429
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,432
I don't have enough
on my plate already?

430
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:32,838
I got a major coke deal, my daughter's
bat mitzvah, which is a total nightmare.

431
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,878
- And now these two guys.
- You think they're on to us?

432
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,742
They are investigating a murder. That's
what cops do. It's why we pay taxes.

433
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,218
You're the worst. You kidding?
Will you look at these two guys?

434
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,517
He's cute, the blond.

435
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:48,920
But I like dark hair.

436
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,324
Maybe we ought to push
this whole thing.

437
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:54,988
- Till things cool off?
- Kevin, please, with the worry.

438
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,397
We're moving ahead as scheduled.
I'll handle those two clowns.

439
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:04,203
So tomorrow, I say we check out
this biker bar, do a little deep cover.

440
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,468
Sounds good.

441
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,012
Who does your wig work?

442
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,145
- I'm sorry, my what?
- Your wig work.

443
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,284
Your undercover work, your disguises.

444
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,284
- You have a wig guy?
- Oh, yeah, he's incredible.

445
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:19,116
Well, if it isn't Sonny and Cher.

446
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,420
- Sonny and Cher.
- Sit on it, Manetti.

447
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,753
- Me sit on it?
- Yeah, you, sit on it.

448
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,955
Why don't you sit on it, Starsky,
how's that sound?

449
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,724
You wish.
Because I'm never sitting on it, ever.

450
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,230
That's not what I heard.

451
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,297
- Starsky!
- Come on. Come on!

452
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,102
- Jesus!
- Stop it!

453
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:45,106
What the hell is going on?
Cool your jets, Starsky!

454
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,412
Everybody, back off!

455
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,481
Including you, Manetti.

456
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,122
I apologize, captain.
You're absolutely right.

457
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:56,782
You know, you're not even worth it,
Starsky. And for the record...

458
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,192
...those are hand towels.
The big towels are on the top shelf.

459
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,829
Hand towels. What a rod.

460
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:09,864
Jesus Christ. He's right.
Go cover up.

461
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,069
Who are you guys?

462
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:27,047
My name's Kansas.
And this is my little man Toto.

463
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:32,085
We're Jesters from up in Big Cliff, coming
down and check out your place. This it?

464
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,724
Is this your place?

465
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,383
- Yeah.
- Nice.

466
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:40,429
Tell me, if you two are Jesters,
what's our credo?

467
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,395
Credo.

468
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,057
Well...

469
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:47,363
You almost got me there.
There's no credo.

470
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,299
Other than the secret credo.

471
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,409
It ain't no secret.
It's written right on our damn crest.

472
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:59,640
A trick question? If it's printed on
the crest, you don't give it as a test.

473
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:03,583
Anybody can read the crest. That wouldn't
prove we're Jesters. Not cool.

474
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,952
- That's a fake mustache.
- Oh, really?

475
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:12,324
Well, I wonder if you
think this is fake.

476
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:16,331
- Now, we got some questions!
- I don't gotta give you nothing, cop!

477
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:21,099
Wrong! First, you've gotta
give me a little respect.

478
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:25,072
Second, you're gonna give me some
answers, comprende, muchacho?

479
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,777
- I like your style.
- I like your moves.

480
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,184
Now, where were we?

481
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,789
You were gonna tell us
about Terrence Meyers.

482
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,453
Who's Terrence Meyers?

483
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:48,395
- Wrong answer, Big Earl.
- Big Earl? I'm not Big Earl.

484
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,899
- I'm Jeff.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

485
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,061
- Jeff?
- No one's who they say they are.

486
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:55,466
Look.

487
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,131
Honest, think about it.
I'm not even big.

488
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:03,309
Yeah. No, that's a good point.

489
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:07,611
Maybe it's an ironic name, like
Tiny over in Vice. He's, like, 8 feet tall.

490
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:11,277
- Everybody says he's tiny...
- I know, except this guy's normal size.

491
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,755
He'd have to be a lot smaller
for a name like Big Earl to be ironic.

492
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:17,588
You don't have to be a midget.
You're not exactly...

493
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,957
- How tall are you?
- I don't know, 5'9"?

494
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:23,730
- Well, that is kind of... Basically...
- Borderline. It's average.

495
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:27,803
Look. Big Earl got pinched two weeks ago.
He's in Bay City Correctional.

496
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:30,065
I took over the bar till he gets out.

497
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:33,301
Jeff, I'm sorry.
We apologize.

498
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,378
We're gonna pay Big Earl a visit.

499
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:38,208
Let me get this for you.
There you go. Good as new.

500
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,079
A word of advice:
Next time you watch a place...

501
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,743
...don't claim you own it
because you watch it.

502
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:48,585
I housesit for my sister all the time,
it's not like I claim that I own her house.

503
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,190
That goes for all y'all.

504
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,523
Don't pretend to be
something you're not.

505
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:55,331
Just be who you are.

506
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,527
That's what's really cool.

507
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,596
How did you get in?
Visiting hours are over.

508
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,268
Special treatment.

509
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,669
We got some questions
about Terrence Meyers.

510
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,604
- Terrence Meyers?
- Yeah.

511
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,403
You made this jacket for him?

512
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:44,781
Gee whiz, I don't seem to know anyone
by that name at all.

513
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,379
Hard customer.

514
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,151
Offer him a radio or some bullshit.

515
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,422
Maybe we can make your stay
a little more comfortable.

516
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:57,391
- Nice transistor radio for your cell?
- No.

517
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,929
- How about a TV?
- I tell you what.

518
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,897
I do like your blonde friend, here.

519
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,131
Let me see your bellybutton.

520
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,674
No. What... Let's go. Come on.

521
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,503
- No, listen.
- No, no! I'm not...

522
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,304
Hold on.
He's obviously a freak.

523
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,243
Just show him a little skin.
Show him your stomach.

524
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,814
Nobody's here.
Come on.

525
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,176
- Are we cool?
- Yes, we're cool.

526
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,420
Oh, eureka.
God, that's nice.

527
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,496
It's like a little bowl of oatmeal
with a hole in it.

528
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,655
- I got one too.
- Oh, come on.

529
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,802
I just got a little more
brown sugar on mine.

530
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,766
Did you say "Terrence Meyers"?

531
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,201
Yeah, I think I did make that jacket.
We might have pulled a job together.

532
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:49,210
What job? Who were you working for?

533
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,374
Stand up. Walk to the back
and do a spin for me.

534
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,018
Wait a second.
I just showed you my stomach...

535
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,980
Come on, a deal's a deal, Earl.

536
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:01,091
Fine, then this conversation is over.

537
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,560
Wait. Wait.

538
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,992
- Hold it. Come on. Wait.
- I can't hear you.

539
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,897
Get up.

540
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,075
- Tell him to take his jacket off.
- Take your jacket off.

541
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:22,877
- Slow spin.
- He says to do a slow spin.

542
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:27,049
Tell him to arch his back
and then look back at me, mean.

543
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:28,515
Like a dragon.

544
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:35,882
He says to arch your back
and look back at him, mean, like a dragon.

545
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,153
But keep it mean.

546
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,240
Tell him great job.
He can sit down.

547
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:01,550
You're a very convincing dragon.
You should feel good about that.

548
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,210
Just get this over with.

549
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:06,083
Okay, here's the deal.

550
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:09,886
Terrence and I worked as extra muscle
for a couple of dealers.

551
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,291
I'd like to tell you who,
but I don't know.

552
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:14,727
I never got a name,
I never got a face.

553
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,298
But I do know one thing:

554
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:22,673
They paid us in coke.
I was pretty pissed at the time.

555
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,172
I was hoping to get cash.
I'm no coke dealer.

556
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,140
Right, so where's the coke?

557
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,745
If we find that coke,
we can probably trace it.

558
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,883
Fine. Fine.

559
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,280
Look, I like you guys, okay?

560
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:38,445
Especially you. Okay?
Don't feel bad about that.

561
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,614
But I like you guys, so I'll tell you.

562
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,516
But...

563
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:46,151
But first I need to see something, okay?

564
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:49,132
And it's gonna involve both of you.

565
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,200
I'm not gonna lie to you.

566
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,234
It's gonna get weird.

567
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,065
Two dragons.

568
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:04,106
Ready? Both of you, take your shirts off.

569
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,909
But do it slow.

570
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:27,069
I guess it's supposed
to rain later tonight.

571
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,536
Yeah, that's what I heard.

572
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:35,445
- Look, you know, what happened...
- Can we please not talk about this, Hutch?

573
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:38,138
We got the coke.
Let's not ever talk about it.

574
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,344
You're right.
That's a good policy.

575
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,619
We got what we came for.

576
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:50,382
- You think dragons ever...
- Stop, I don't want to talk about it!

577
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:09,312
What the hell is wrong with you two?

578
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,514
- Come on, what are you...?
- You have brought disgrace...

579
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,948
...on everyone who's
ever worn a uniform.

580
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,088
My God.

581
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,190
- We didn't know there was a camera.
- Cap, we're sorry.

582
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,758
At least we got the stash.

583
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,521
There's gotta be 30 grams
of coke here, minimum.

584
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,824
This could lead us to the dealers
that iced Terrence Meyers.

585
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,797
It's evidence.
We can print the bag, run forensics.

586
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,961
We did.
We got nothing.

587
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:40,042
What we got is a bag
of artificial sweetener.

588
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,472
What are you talking about?

589
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,637
My granny wouldn't think
this was coke.

590
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:48,444
Come on, that's impossible.
We got the stuff from Big Earl.

591
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:51,019
- I'm taking you two off this floater.
- What?

592
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,786
- I'm giving it to Manetti.
- Manetti? Oh, come on, cap!

593
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:58,326
- Manetti's the worst cop on the force!
- Starsky. Stop.

594
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:02,023
Go on, sit down.
Come on.

595
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:08,398
Look, captain, we're sorry, but come on.
You can't take us off this.

596
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,040
I just did. Now, leave.

597
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:18,125
And take your bag
of artificial sweetener with you.

598
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:23,925
- Kicking the chair was a nice touch.
- Yeah, too bad it didn't work.

599
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:25,568
He'll get over it.

600
00:40:25,736 --> 00:40:29,035
What I can't figure out is why Earl
got paid with bunk cocaine.

601
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:30,697
Now we've got two leads.

602
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,400
- We do?
- Stacey and Holly.

603
00:40:33,578 --> 00:40:36,706
- Those two cheerleaders?
- No, no, those two witnesses.

604
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:38,143
They met Terrence.

605
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:41,943
Let's take them out,
see what we can learn.

606
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:46,556
I mean, is it our fault that they also
happen to be a couple of hot foxes?

607
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:49,582
Reese, I couldn't help myself.
They were cops.

608
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,228
- They were just too macho.
- Macho?

609
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:55,760
- It's simple. You should have lied.
- I did. I lied about you.

610
00:40:55,933 --> 00:40:57,696
I didn't tell them anything.

611
00:40:57,869 --> 00:41:00,599
But I had to give them something.
They were so pure.

612
00:41:00,771 --> 00:41:03,672
You're lucky you're in the joint.
Do you understand me?

613
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:06,202
- Look at the bright side.
- Bright side?

614
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:09,437
It's the ultimate test.
The coke was in the police station.

615
00:41:09,614 --> 00:41:11,912
They cleared it.
You should be happy.

616
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:14,517
Well, guess what?
I'm not happy.

617
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:16,812
I'm not happy at all about it, Earl!

618
00:41:16,988 --> 00:41:19,684
Don't shush me!
Don't tell me to calm down!

619
00:41:19,857 --> 00:41:22,018
- Understand?
- What are you wearing? Quick.

620
00:41:22,193 --> 00:41:23,660
What am I wearing?

621
00:41:23,828 --> 00:41:26,991
Silk flowered shirt and a vest. Why?

622
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:28,926
That's gorgeous.

623
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,161
- You sick son of a bitch.
- Don't hang up. Don't hang up!

624
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,568
God. Some people.

625
00:41:39,944 --> 00:41:42,640
I'm not gonna be able
to fit in my uniform tomorrow.

626
00:41:42,813 --> 00:41:44,280
Is that a good or bad thing?

627
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,710
Is this the way you two
always treat witnesses?

628
00:41:48,886 --> 00:41:53,380
Well, that depends. If it's a misdemeanor,
we've been known to skip the fondue...

629
00:41:53,557 --> 00:41:56,424
...and move right to foot massages.
Let me see.

630
00:41:56,594 --> 00:41:59,825
Watch out! Wait a minute,
I think that's police brutality.

631
00:41:59,997 --> 00:42:02,932
- Anybody for some coffee?
- No, thanks.

632
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,500
Okay, one for le chef.

633
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:09,737
Wow. This place is great.

634
00:42:15,546 --> 00:42:17,514
It serves my needs.
It's cozy. Homey.

635
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:20,048
- Can you help me find the sugar?
- It's there.

636
00:42:20,217 --> 00:42:22,412
Hutch, help me find the sugar.

637
00:42:24,221 --> 00:42:26,712
- Okay. Pardon me.
- Okay.

638
00:42:26,924 --> 00:42:28,448
- How we doing?
- Great.

639
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:30,787
- Your fondue put us over the top.
- Really?

640
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:33,658
Which one do you like?
We're gonna stick to this.

641
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:36,391
- I have a thing for blondes.
- Good. I'll take anything.

642
00:42:37,034 --> 00:42:38,695
They're sweet little angels.

643
00:42:39,136 --> 00:42:41,627
In two minutes,
I want you to grab my guitar...

644
00:42:41,806 --> 00:42:44,502
...bring it to me,
put it in my hands and step back.

645
00:42:44,675 --> 00:42:47,508
- You play?
- Just bring me the guitar.

646
00:42:47,678 --> 00:42:50,476
Wait. Hey, hey, where's the sugar?

647
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:52,706
I don't think I have any.

648
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,109
- That's great. He's a cop.
- Come here.

649
00:42:55,286 --> 00:42:57,015
- Both of you.
- You're so funny.

650
00:42:57,188 --> 00:42:59,486
It's like a magpie convention in here.

651
00:42:59,657 --> 00:43:02,125
Let's get the cup out.

652
00:43:06,063 --> 00:43:08,258
Thank you, Big Earl.

653
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:13,899
Do you ever get scared out there,
on the streets?

654
00:43:14,071 --> 00:43:18,770
Yeah. I'd like to say no,
but the truth is, I do sometimes.

655
00:43:20,044 --> 00:43:24,105
I'm one of those guys that's more about
helping others than helping myself.

656
00:43:24,281 --> 00:43:27,045
- There we go.
- It's all I knew.

657
00:43:27,218 --> 00:43:30,278
It's more that there's someone
I might not be able to help.

658
00:43:30,454 --> 00:43:34,914
A citizen that needs aid,
or even an animal.

659
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:37,652
- Look what I found.
- Put that away. Put it away!

660
00:43:37,828 --> 00:43:40,797
Hutch, you gotta play.
Come on. Play, play. Please.

661
00:43:40,965 --> 00:43:43,126
Don't you wanna play?
Come on. Hutch!

662
00:43:43,768 --> 00:43:45,736
All right. Holly, turn off the music.

663
00:43:45,903 --> 00:43:47,268
- Now, come on!
- Oh, sorry.

664
00:43:47,438 --> 00:43:49,372
Look alive. Let's go.

665
00:43:49,607 --> 00:43:53,134
- Hutch is gonna play.
- What have you gotten me into, Starsky?

666
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:57,144
- Thought we were partners.
- Come on, Hutch!

667
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:01,746
One, two, three.

668
00:45:01,745 --> 00:45:03,975
- That was great, Hutch!
- Come on, you guys.

669
00:45:04,148 --> 00:45:07,379
It was just a guy here with a guitar,
singing his heart out.

670
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:10,954
Starsky's bored.

671
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:14,490
- Anybody else bored?
- What?

672
00:45:14,658 --> 00:45:16,592
- A club could be fun.
- Club. Yeah.

673
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,490
Okay, I'll get some more coffee
and then we'll go.

674
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,024
Is he okay?

675
00:45:49,093 --> 00:45:50,720
Isn't this place great?

676
00:45:50,895 --> 00:45:52,453
Do you like places like this?

677
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,326
You're a cheerleader,
so you're dancing in formation.

678
00:45:55,499 --> 00:45:58,593
This place can't be fun,
because it's like you're at work.

679
00:45:58,769 --> 00:46:00,999
Are you okay?
You seem kind of wound up.

680
00:46:01,172 --> 00:46:03,538
Wound up?
No, I'm just pumped. I'm excited.

681
00:46:03,707 --> 00:46:07,609
Rock-solid, ready to go. A little bit
paranoid, but feeling really good.

682
00:46:07,778 --> 00:46:10,338
- Can I kiss you?
- Okay.

683
00:46:12,383 --> 00:46:14,112
- Watch it, man.
- Excuse me?

684
00:46:14,418 --> 00:46:17,819
I said, watch it. Floor's for dancing.
You can tell by the lights.

685
00:46:18,022 --> 00:46:19,990
- Wanna tangle, curly?
- Come on. No.

686
00:46:20,157 --> 00:46:22,091
- No, we're gonna dance.
- No, no, no.

687
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:24,557
Curly wants to tangle.

688
00:46:24,895 --> 00:46:28,262
- Do you really want a piece of this?
- I don't want a piece.

689
00:46:28,966 --> 00:46:31,434
I want the whole thing.

690
00:46:32,937 --> 00:46:34,461
Yeah!

691
00:46:34,638 --> 00:46:37,334
- Oh, my, folks!
- Please don't do this.

692
00:46:37,508 --> 00:46:39,840
- Don't worry. I can take him.
- It's not that.

693
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:42,478
You shouldn't do this
because it's so lame.

694
00:46:42,646 --> 00:46:45,376
Tonight, our own Dancing Rick
is being called out...

695
00:46:45,549 --> 00:46:48,950
...by new guy David Stamsky.
- No, no, Starsky.

696
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,917
Back at you.
If you've got a pair of sunglasses...

697
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:57,550
...l'd put them on, because I got a feeling
these two are gonna light it up!

698
00:46:58,295 --> 00:47:00,889
Boz, reel it in!

699
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,625
All right, settle down.
Everybody settle.

700
00:47:05,803 --> 00:47:08,567
You know the rules.
Keep it safe, keep it sexy...

701
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:12,004
...and above all, turn up the night!

702
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:16,936
Dancing Rick getting warmed up here.

703
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:19,776
What's he gonna bring out
for the appetizer course?

704
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:24,649
Oh, it's a little hand-over-hand tuggle, man,
right into the center of the floor.

705
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:28,881
That's all he's giving him.

706
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:30,993
That's a bucketful of confidence.

707
00:47:31,161 --> 00:47:34,426
Over to new guy David Starsky.

708
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:38,363
This guy could be trouble.

709
00:47:39,203 --> 00:47:43,299
It's the Wild West.
Those are six-guns full of sexy.

710
00:47:43,474 --> 00:47:47,410
The good, the bad and the groovy.

711
00:47:47,578 --> 00:47:50,547
One, two, three, four,
we've got disco war, folks.

712
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:56,816
Dancing Rick's going, "I don't like you,
but I respect your moves."

713
00:47:56,987 --> 00:47:59,615
Here comes Starsky again.

714
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:04,227
Driving that disco big rig.
Shift gears, blow your funky horn.

715
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:08,422
Pull into the truck stop and get yourself
some scrapple made out of sexy.

716
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:13,499
Disco Rick brings it right back
and he's not wasting any time, folks.

717
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:17,698
From the future of 1984,
that's a funky disco robot.

718
00:48:18,709 --> 00:48:22,406
They're both on the floor, folks,
eye to eye. It's disco Vietnam.

719
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:24,774
Neither one's blinking or backing down.

720
00:48:24,948 --> 00:48:26,347
Let's see what happens.

721
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:29,785
Angry cat.
Kitten has claws.

722
00:48:29,953 --> 00:48:33,218
All right, looks like it's over.
Remember, $2 Harvey Wall...

723
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:36,882
Oh, my God!
David Starsky, taking it over the line!

724
00:48:45,936 --> 00:48:48,370
How about that?
Very sexy, very macho.

725
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:50,598
But that's a little too close to call.

726
00:48:50,774 --> 00:48:54,540
We'll have to depend on our patented
American Lights Applause-O-Meter.

727
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:58,910
So let's bring out our combatants, folks.
Come on, big hand for them.

728
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:01,509
Here we go.

729
00:49:01,852 --> 00:49:06,346
First off, over to my man,
Dancing Rick.

730
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:12,118
And over to the new guy,
David Starsky.

731
00:49:13,597 --> 00:49:15,895
Folks, pretty close.
I hate to do this...

732
00:49:16,066 --> 00:49:18,762
...but I gotta give it to my man
Dancing Rick.

733
00:49:18,936 --> 00:49:20,836
Boo! Boo!

734
00:49:21,004 --> 00:49:23,734
What? Hey, hey, do it again!
That's B.S.

735
00:49:23,907 --> 00:49:26,137
- What?
- I won. Do the applause thing again!

736
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:28,107
It was just for fun. Forget it...

737
00:49:28,278 --> 00:49:30,712
- I said, do it again, liar!
- Not cool, not cool!

738
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:33,247
- Liar! Do it again!
- All right.

739
00:49:33,417 --> 00:49:36,318
Hey, hey, settle down.
Settle down.

740
00:49:36,487 --> 00:49:38,421
I'm a cop. It's cool.

741
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:41,352
It's okay.

742
00:49:43,494 --> 00:49:46,122
It's okay, it's okay!
Calm down, people.

743
00:49:46,296 --> 00:49:49,993
Bay City P.D.
We got him.

744
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:52,965
We're gonna get you home.

745
00:49:53,704 --> 00:49:55,569
- Where am I?
- You were freaking out.

746
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:58,640
- I had to take you down.
- What?

747
00:50:01,378 --> 00:50:03,073
There we go.

748
00:50:03,247 --> 00:50:05,545
Easy does it.

749
00:50:06,183 --> 00:50:08,117
Here we go.

750
00:50:11,455 --> 00:50:13,616
I think I was drugged.

751
00:50:14,925 --> 00:50:16,324
Sounds like you did coke.

752
00:50:18,562 --> 00:50:21,463
I mean, from what I've read
about the effects.

753
00:50:21,632 --> 00:50:25,864
I don't use coke.
I had coffee tonight.

754
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:32,035
- What is that?
- Sweetener, right?

755
00:50:32,209 --> 00:50:34,871
The stuff from Earl?
What are you doing with this?

756
00:50:35,045 --> 00:50:36,706
- Hutch?
- Where'd you get this?

757
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:40,042
- I beat that guy. What was that about?
- You did.

758
00:50:40,217 --> 00:50:44,415
- You won. You danced your heart out.
- And everybody saw it.

759
00:50:44,588 --> 00:50:45,885
- Sleep.
- I was robbed.

760
00:50:46,056 --> 00:50:49,924
I know. We was robbed.
We was robbed.

761
00:50:50,127 --> 00:50:51,389
Go to sleep.

762
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:58,292
Go to sleep, tiny dancer. All right.

763
00:50:58,602 --> 00:51:00,229
Jesus Christ.

764
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,202
- Is he okay?
- Oh, yeah, he's okay.

765
00:51:06,376 --> 00:51:08,970
He just needs to sleep it off.

766
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,844
Quite a night, huh?

767
00:51:12,149 --> 00:51:14,447
You can say that again.

768
00:51:14,885 --> 00:51:17,581
Guess it's kind of winding down.

769
00:51:17,754 --> 00:51:21,315
- Well, it doesn't have to be over.
- What do you mean?

770
00:51:26,697 --> 00:51:29,257
Where did that come from?

771
00:51:32,903 --> 00:51:36,270
I just want you to know,
I really like your partner.

772
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,536
- I know, he's such a good guy.
- This is just, like, whatever.

773
00:51:40,711 --> 00:51:44,044
I don't think we even have to judge it.
It's too natural.

774
00:51:44,214 --> 00:51:45,772
- Okay.
- It's just...

775
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:49,214
You guys wanna kiss? Yeah.

776
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,427
I hear somebody stirring.
There he is.

777
00:52:07,938 --> 00:52:10,133
I feel for you.

778
00:52:11,975 --> 00:52:14,603
Jesus! Please, turn that off!

779
00:52:14,778 --> 00:52:17,770
Easy, killer.
Just a blender.

780
00:52:19,383 --> 00:52:23,649
- What time is it?
- Time for Hutch's hangover cure.

781
00:52:23,987 --> 00:52:27,013
- What's in it?
- Pepto-Bismol, Aunt Jemima mix...

782
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:29,124
...Tang and a little flat Tab.

783
00:52:29,293 --> 00:52:31,523
Most important thing.

784
00:52:32,663 --> 00:52:34,028
And a raw egg.

785
00:52:34,731 --> 00:52:37,461
Saves lives. Trust me.

786
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:41,167
And?

787
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:47,272
- It's good.
- What did I tell you?

788
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:49,738
Sorry about last night.

789
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:54,043
- Thanks for taking care of the girls.
- Hey, no problem. Happy to do it.

790
00:52:54,217 --> 00:52:57,675
What are partners for?
Speaking of which...

791
00:52:58,488 --> 00:53:02,948
...I checked this stuff out and even though
it tastes like sugar, that is cocaine.

792
00:53:04,328 --> 00:53:07,058
- You sure?
- I'm sure...

793
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:10,495
...Stacey's sure, Holly's sure...

794
00:53:11,702 --> 00:53:13,135
How do you like your eggs?

795
00:53:13,537 --> 00:53:17,166
Didn't Huggy mention something
about a coke deal going down?

796
00:53:17,341 --> 00:53:19,775
"One for the Guinness Book,"
was how he put it.

797
00:53:19,943 --> 00:53:21,740
Seems like a big coincidence.

798
00:53:21,912 --> 00:53:23,903
Why don't I drive?
You don't look good.

799
00:53:24,081 --> 00:53:26,777
No. If I'm alive, I drive.

800
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,781
Rhyming already, you must be...

801
00:53:36,693 --> 00:53:37,955
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

802
00:53:38,128 --> 00:53:40,528
He blew out my fricking window!

803
00:53:41,498 --> 00:53:43,989
All right! Enough with the car!
We get it!

804
00:53:44,768 --> 00:53:46,861
Stop shooting my car!

805
00:53:47,037 --> 00:53:49,028
Okay, cover me. Say when.

806
00:53:49,206 --> 00:53:50,833
Go!

807
00:53:52,876 --> 00:53:55,242
Zebra to base,
I want you to run a plate.

808
00:53:55,479 --> 00:53:58,004
Larry, one, apple, nine, eight, four.

809
00:53:58,181 --> 00:54:01,207
Larry, one, apple, nine, eight, four.

810
00:54:01,518 --> 00:54:02,780
- Damn it!
- You okay?

811
00:54:02,953 --> 00:54:06,218
Look at this! This is horrible!

812
00:54:06,657 --> 00:54:09,888
What kind of world do we live in
where somebody does this?

813
00:54:10,527 --> 00:54:13,223
Well, I think he was aiming at us.

814
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:16,224
Think this is funny?
Seriously, is this funny?

815
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,234
Zebra 3, we have an ID on that plate.
Lee M. Chau, 1325 Western.

816
00:54:20,604 --> 00:54:23,232
- I repeat...
- Ready to dish out a little payback?

817
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,832
Freeze! Bay City P.D.!

818
00:55:01,645 --> 00:55:04,079
- The hell was that?
- I think it's his kid.

819
00:55:04,247 --> 00:55:09,685
All right, just sit tight, little boy.
Well, well, well, this looks familiar.

820
00:55:09,853 --> 00:55:13,084
Possession of cocaine and
attempted murder, huh?

821
00:55:13,256 --> 00:55:14,985
- Jesus!
- What was that?

822
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:21,291
That ain't a kid! It's a tiny little man!
And he's got knives! Goddamn!

823
00:55:21,465 --> 00:55:23,092
- My arm!
- Oh, shit!

824
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:30,531
Make him stop! Make him stop!
Tell him to stop! Stop it!

825
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:39,878
Starsky! Starsky, we need to go now!
Come on!

826
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:41,847
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

827
00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:48,114
All right, now...

828
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:53,194
Okay, time out. Let's just take a little break.
I'm gonna get out of here... Jeez!

829
00:55:54,765 --> 00:55:57,199
Oh, mama! What is your problem?

830
00:55:57,901 --> 00:56:00,062
I said, time out!

831
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:05,005
Hutch! A little help.

832
00:56:05,175 --> 00:56:10,238
He pinned you good, partner.
On three. One, two...

833
00:56:11,081 --> 00:56:13,072
Time to answer some questions,
old man.

834
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:16,811
Who's the little dwarf you got
throwing knives at me and my partner?

835
00:56:16,987 --> 00:56:19,148
That was no dwarf. That was my son.

836
00:56:19,322 --> 00:56:21,313
Liar!

837
00:56:21,725 --> 00:56:23,886
Come on, you're going downtown.

838
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:27,120
Let's go, Starsky. On your feet!

839
00:56:53,623 --> 00:56:57,115
Now, you wanna tell me
who hired you?

840
00:56:58,295 --> 00:57:03,130
We have a saying in Koreatown.
It goes, "Kiss my yellow ass, copper!"

841
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:09,060
All right. You wanna play games?
I got a game for you, Chau.

842
00:57:13,076 --> 00:57:15,408
Let's play a little Russian roulette.

843
00:57:17,948 --> 00:57:20,246
We got a little saying here in Bay City:

844
00:57:21,852 --> 00:57:23,444
"You cross the line...

845
00:57:25,455 --> 00:57:26,717
...your nuts are mine."

846
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:29,882
There's really a bullet in the gun.

847
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:33,552
- Yes, I know. That is the point...
- No, you don't understand.

848
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:35,789
- Let's play!
- The bullet went inside!

849
00:57:35,966 --> 00:57:39,663
Come on, you wanna play,
let's play! Let's play!

850
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:41,632
- Your turn!
- No!

851
00:57:41,805 --> 00:57:46,640
I thought you wanted to play. Come on,
Chau. You wanna play? Let's play a game!

852
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:51,140
- What are you doing? Jesus.
- Our little friend here is about to talk.

853
00:57:51,314 --> 00:57:52,542
What in the holy...?

854
00:58:03,293 --> 00:58:07,195
- All right, enough with the talking. Let's go.
- What? No! Starsky, no!

855
00:58:11,468 --> 00:58:15,598
- You're crazy!
- Are you out of your mind?

856
00:58:17,073 --> 00:58:18,904
Calm down.

857
00:58:19,075 --> 00:58:24,206
Calm down? He tried to kill me. He shoot
everything. I have heart attack already.

858
00:58:24,414 --> 00:58:27,144
It's over. It's over.
Just calm down.

859
00:58:37,694 --> 00:58:40,424
- What?
- No, nothing. Nothing. This guy is funny.

860
00:58:40,597 --> 00:58:44,033
- It's not about you.
- That's great. He can be your new partner.

861
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,395
Chau and Hutch. Sounds cool.

862
00:58:46,569 --> 00:58:52,235
Forget it. All right, Chau, what else can
you tell me about the guys that hired you?

863
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:57,642
Not much. A couple of whiteys.
Nice suit. Perry Ellis.

864
00:58:57,814 --> 00:58:59,975
They pay, I do job.

865
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:02,516
- What did they look like?
- I don't know.

866
00:59:02,686 --> 00:59:06,053
They were white.
All you guys look alike to me.

867
00:59:08,992 --> 00:59:12,359
That's funny, all you guys
look alike to us. Orientals.

868
00:59:13,563 --> 00:59:15,053
So where'd you meet him?

869
00:59:15,231 --> 00:59:20,533
We met... How do you say? By water.

870
00:59:20,704 --> 00:59:24,765
- At the beach?
- No, no, no. On water.

871
00:59:24,941 --> 00:59:29,401
- Right, a boat. You met on a boat.
- No, no, no. Not a boat.

872
00:59:29,946 --> 00:59:31,379
It's a yacht.

873
01:00:16,393 --> 01:00:20,261
Rock into womanhood, Elizabeth!
We know that you will.

874
01:00:21,564 --> 01:00:23,156
- All right.
- What's that mean?

875
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:27,326
We have a special delivery for
the little lady. It's right over here.

876
01:00:27,504 --> 01:00:28,801
Let's see what's inside.

877
01:00:53,263 --> 01:00:56,528
- These pantomimes suck.
- Don't look at me. I didn't hire them.

878
01:00:56,699 --> 01:00:59,429
- Well, who did?
- I don't know.

879
01:01:02,439 --> 01:01:05,340
These pantomimes aren't very good.

880
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:08,300
This must be Reese's big surprise.

881
01:01:08,478 --> 01:01:10,639
Look at me, guys,
I'm a mime too.

882
01:01:10,814 --> 01:01:13,442
- Everyone's miming something.
- Embarrassing.

883
01:01:23,026 --> 01:01:24,459
- Reese just left.
- I know.

884
01:01:24,627 --> 01:01:27,027
- Stay here, I'll follow him.
- I'll follow him.

885
01:01:27,197 --> 01:01:31,293
No, you stay. Keep them occupied.
You're doing great. They love you.

886
01:01:41,878 --> 01:01:45,336
I might do the glass wall
one more time.

887
01:01:46,716 --> 01:01:48,343
Boo!

888
01:01:48,518 --> 01:01:53,319
Terrific. Tell him you like him, ask him to
sit by you at the cafeteria. How do I know?

889
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:58,154
What am I, your counselor? Yeah, I'd like
to get to the information that I need, okay?

890
01:01:59,762 --> 01:02:01,059
It's done.

891
01:02:01,397 --> 01:02:07,097
My buddy delivered the package. It's in
your garage. It's locked up nice and tight...

892
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:10,034
...in case anybody gets nosy.
- No one saw him?

893
01:02:10,206 --> 01:02:11,366
Not a soul.

894
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:13,236
Now, about my fee...

895
01:02:13,409 --> 01:02:17,140
You'll be paid as soon as I've
checked it out. If you'll excuse me...

896
01:02:17,313 --> 01:02:19,713
- Reese, wait.
- What?

897
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:23,143
- Mazel tov, man.
- Thanks.

898
01:02:23,319 --> 01:02:24,581
They grow up so fast.

899
01:02:24,954 --> 01:02:29,015
- Go play dragon. I gotta go.
- All right. Big kisses.

900
01:02:30,793 --> 01:02:35,526
Thank you, everybody, for coming out to
celebrate my little girl's bat mitzvah.

901
01:02:35,698 --> 01:02:39,429
I should say "young woman."
Lt'll take me a while to get used to that.

902
01:02:39,602 --> 01:02:42,002
- This guy's good. Sweet.
- It's in his garage.

903
01:02:42,172 --> 01:02:44,072
- What?
- The cocaine is in his garage.

904
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,333
- Are you sure?
- We take him down now.

905
01:02:46,509 --> 01:02:49,307
- Let's go.
- All right, cut the music.

906
01:02:49,479 --> 01:02:51,071
Cut the music.

907
01:02:51,247 --> 01:02:54,705
I think I speak for everyone
when I say we're a little mimed out.

908
01:02:54,884 --> 01:02:56,215
Don't worry. Show's over.

909
01:02:56,719 --> 01:02:59,654
You're under arrest for possession
with intent to sell.

910
01:02:59,822 --> 01:03:02,757
- This man's a drug dealer.
- Okay, I think what we have...

911
01:03:02,926 --> 01:03:05,724
- Maybe you didn't hear us.
- Take it easy, everybody.

912
01:03:05,895 --> 01:03:08,830
You're making the biggest mistake
of your life, hear me?

913
01:03:08,998 --> 01:03:11,159
You're the one making
the mistake, pusher.

914
01:03:12,769 --> 01:03:16,034
Kevin, call my attorney,
please. Ridiculous.

915
01:03:16,439 --> 01:03:18,839
- Open it.
- My hands are tied.

916
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:21,806
Fine. Allow me.

917
01:03:22,946 --> 01:03:25,813
Let this be a lesson to everyone,
especially you kids.

918
01:03:25,982 --> 01:03:29,042
Don't be fooled by the first-class suit
and the big house.

919
01:03:29,219 --> 01:03:32,484
Reese Feldman's nothing more than
a two-bit drug dealer.

920
01:03:32,655 --> 01:03:34,555
You want some proof?

921
01:03:35,158 --> 01:03:37,092
Here's some proof.

922
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:42,022
This is a bad man.

923
01:03:42,765 --> 01:03:45,461
And this is what bad men do.

924
01:03:46,436 --> 01:03:48,597
A pony!

925
01:03:48,938 --> 01:03:51,202
Happy bat mitzvah, baby. I love you.

926
01:03:55,245 --> 01:03:57,509
Take the kids in, come on.
Let's go, kids.

927
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,878
It's all right, baby, it's okay. Come here.
Come here. We'll get you a new pony.

928
01:04:04,187 --> 01:04:07,384
Hey there, little fella. You okay?

929
01:04:11,294 --> 01:04:16,994
Mr. Feldman, on behalf of the
entire Bay City Police Department...

930
01:04:17,667 --> 01:04:21,763
...I sincerely apologize.
- That's okay, captain.

931
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:25,374
My attorney here would love to
take them down, but I know...

932
01:04:25,541 --> 01:04:27,338
...that in the bottom
of their hearts...

933
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:32,311
...these two detectives were just
trying to protect me and my family.

934
01:04:32,915 --> 01:04:35,907
I gotcha. Thank you.

935
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:41,483
I respect your attitude,
but you can be sure...

936
01:04:41,658 --> 01:04:44,388
...it will never happen again,
because as of now...

937
01:04:44,727 --> 01:04:47,389
...both of you are suspended indefinitely.

938
01:04:47,563 --> 01:04:52,330
Look, cap, this was my fault.
Don't drag Hutch into this. I shot the pony.

939
01:04:52,502 --> 01:04:54,163
You care what happens to Hutch?

940
01:04:54,337 --> 01:04:58,068
You filed for transfer two weeks ago,
citing his behavior as a reason.

941
01:04:58,241 --> 01:05:01,176
- Captain...
- Oh yeah, yeah. Check this out.

942
01:05:01,344 --> 01:05:03,938
Sounds like you're quite
the crime fighter, Hutch.

943
01:05:04,113 --> 01:05:07,674
- You filed for a transfer?
- Guns and badges, right here, on my desk.

944
01:05:11,587 --> 01:05:14,112
Your mother would be
very disappointed in you.

945
01:05:30,273 --> 01:05:33,902
Man, I've really had it with that Doby.
I mean, it's enough already.

946
01:05:34,077 --> 01:05:39,037
"Cavorting with nefarious characters.
Conduct unbecoming of an officer."

947
01:05:39,415 --> 01:05:42,748
I wrote that two weeks ago.
Things are really cool with us now.

948
01:05:42,919 --> 01:05:45,353
- Hey, did you go through my locker?
- No.

949
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:48,718
- You went through my locker.
- I might have looked inside...

950
01:05:48,891 --> 01:05:53,419
If you got a problem with someone, tell it
to their face. You come to them as a man.

951
01:05:53,596 --> 01:05:58,329
You don't go behind their back and write
a thesis and try to get transferred.

952
01:06:04,907 --> 01:06:07,137
Backstabber!

953
01:06:07,377 --> 01:06:10,073
Yeah, don't anybody work
with David Starsky.

954
01:06:10,246 --> 01:06:12,908
He'll stab you in the back.

955
01:06:14,317 --> 01:06:17,718
You've got to let this go.
We got lucky. These guys screwed up.

956
01:06:17,887 --> 01:06:21,084
- They can't even touch us now. It is over.
- I don't care.

957
01:06:21,257 --> 01:06:25,193
No one dresses as a mime and embarrasses
me at my daughter's bat mitzvah.

958
01:06:25,528 --> 01:06:26,961
In my own house, no less.

959
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:29,462
Have some perspective.
We're almost finished.

960
01:06:29,632 --> 01:06:33,568
We're a few days from closing
a $35-million deal. Let it slide.

961
01:06:33,736 --> 01:06:36,864
Yeah, I'll let it slide. When they're dead.

962
01:06:38,241 --> 01:06:39,606
Why did I get so lucky?

963
01:06:39,776 --> 01:06:42,836
I don't know, I just love
when you talk so tough.

964
01:06:43,012 --> 01:06:46,277
Of course you do. That's why
you're my girlfriend on the side.

965
01:07:17,847 --> 01:07:19,508
Hey, Hutch.

966
01:08:02,391 --> 01:08:04,552
"Ruin me!"

967
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,090
Excuse me, let me have
a minute with my friend.

968
01:08:12,268 --> 01:08:17,228
He didn't care if he got ruined. That was
the whole point of the episode. Did you...?

969
01:08:17,406 --> 01:08:21,467
Hutch, you gonna have to lay up off
of this juice. You had too much to drink.

970
01:08:21,644 --> 01:08:27,048
Come on. I feel like a million bucks.
Just laughing, having a good time.

971
01:08:27,216 --> 01:08:28,808
It ain't even funny no more.

972
01:08:28,985 --> 01:08:33,422
There used to be a time here when you
peed against the wall, you did it outside.

973
01:08:36,425 --> 01:08:39,917
Lighten up, it's Friday night.
Okay? It's a bar.

974
01:08:40,096 --> 01:08:43,190
Hutch, it's Wednesday afternoon, man.
Snap out of it.

975
01:08:45,301 --> 01:08:48,668
- What time is it?
- It's 5:00, man.

976
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:54,140
Shit. I'm supposed to pick up Willis at 3.
Huggy, I'm sorry, we...

977
01:08:56,479 --> 01:09:00,245
Hutch! Hey, Hutch! You home?

978
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:04,477
You were supposed to pick me up
at 3:00 today. What happened?

979
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:06,785
Deadbeat.

980
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:32,076
If you could have yourself one wish,
what would it be for?

981
01:09:32,248 --> 01:09:35,547
"Mama put the salt back on a
straight line with the pepper...

982
01:09:35,718 --> 01:09:39,347
...and got that look like when
she be telling me that old wise stuff.

983
01:09:39,522 --> 01:09:41,490
She told Nobie he
should wish for..."

984
01:09:41,924 --> 01:09:46,884
Good friends. Free to Be You and Me.
That's what Mama tells Nobie to wish for.

985
01:09:47,196 --> 01:09:49,357
- Well, well, well.
- How you doing, Willis?

986
01:09:49,532 --> 01:09:53,332
- I'm pretty good.
- Yeah? Got you something.

987
01:09:53,502 --> 01:09:57,131
Damn. A wrist rocket.

988
01:09:57,306 --> 01:10:02,300
- Watch out with that thing. Very powerful.
- Cool. Thanks, Starsky.

989
01:10:02,478 --> 01:10:05,743
Pretty sure those are illegal.
Even though you're my friend...

990
01:10:05,915 --> 01:10:08,008
...might have to report you to Doby.

991
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:13,720
All right. Okay, look, Hutch, can we...?

992
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:16,685
Is it all right if I talk
to you outside?

993
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:19,521
No, I better stay here with the kid.

994
01:10:19,929 --> 01:10:22,898
All right. Hey, feel better, all right?

995
01:10:23,065 --> 01:10:24,657
You got it.

996
01:10:25,868 --> 01:10:30,396
- Can you believe that guy? What a...
- Hutch, the man was trying to apologize.

997
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,465
Dig this, man. Someone once said...

998
01:10:33,643 --> 01:10:37,511
..."To err is human, to forgive, divine."

999
01:10:39,682 --> 01:10:41,013
What idiot said that?

1000
01:10:41,183 --> 01:10:45,119
I believe that was God,
the greatest mack of all.

1001
01:10:47,323 --> 01:10:50,190
David. David.

1002
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,159
Yeah.

1003
01:10:53,929 --> 01:10:55,658
Okay, so, what did you wanna say?

1004
01:10:55,831 --> 01:10:59,494
Nothing. Apparently you're too busy
and I'm not worth it. It's fine.

1005
01:10:59,669 --> 01:11:02,137
- Really, it's good.
- Come on, let's hear it.

1006
01:11:02,571 --> 01:11:07,406
There's nothing that... I just was gonna
say that I think you're a good cop.

1007
01:11:07,576 --> 01:11:11,842
- Okay, well, thank you.
- And I am...

1008
01:11:12,014 --> 01:11:16,212
...sorry about what I wrote in the report.

1009
01:11:16,385 --> 01:11:20,287
Yeah, because I'm telling you, I felt like
I'd just gotten my world rocked...

1010
01:11:21,323 --> 01:11:23,120
- Are you crying?
- What's that?

1011
01:11:23,292 --> 01:11:26,750
- Are you crying?
- No, I'm not crying. You're crying.

1012
01:11:26,929 --> 01:11:29,124
It's okay to cry. People cry.

1013
01:11:29,298 --> 01:11:34,895
That's great, but I'm not crying. I'm not a
crier. I don't cry. I work out. I have hobbies.

1014
01:11:35,071 --> 01:11:36,333
- Come here.
- What?

1015
01:11:36,706 --> 01:11:40,005
- Come here. I forgive you, all right?
- Okay.

1016
01:11:40,176 --> 01:11:41,643
I forgive you.

1017
01:11:42,111 --> 01:11:45,603
Okay, that's probably enough.
That's enough.

1018
01:11:45,781 --> 01:11:47,305
- All right?
- Okay.

1019
01:11:47,483 --> 01:11:49,348
- Are we good?
- Yeah, we're good.

1020
01:11:49,518 --> 01:11:52,078
Because we got some people
that want us dead.

1021
01:11:52,254 --> 01:11:56,714
They took a shot at you. They tried to
blow up my house, almost killed little Willis.

1022
01:11:56,892 --> 01:11:59,258
We gotta do... Now what?

1023
01:11:59,428 --> 01:12:02,363
Nothing. I'm just excited.
Let's get these scumbags!

1024
01:12:02,531 --> 01:12:05,432
- Get them! That's what I wanna see.
- Let's get them!

1025
01:12:05,601 --> 01:12:08,502
- Get some tissues. Let's go.
- What are you doing?

1026
01:13:05,528 --> 01:13:09,760
- Damn. I'll tell you that.
- Look, I'm telling you, it's right here.

1027
01:13:09,932 --> 01:13:14,528
Reese is meeting with the biggest drug
dealers in back alleys all over the place.

1028
01:13:14,703 --> 01:13:16,898
But talking isn't illegal.

1029
01:13:17,072 --> 01:13:21,031
Yeah, the guy's not stupid.
He knows how to stay clean.

1030
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:22,973
Dirty ones always do.

1031
01:13:23,145 --> 01:13:27,673
We gotta find a way to get close to him,
get inside and hear what's going on.

1032
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:30,614
It's gonna be tough.
The guy knows what we look like.

1033
01:13:30,786 --> 01:13:33,084
He doesn't know what
Huggy Bear looks like.

1034
01:13:35,591 --> 01:13:40,392
Man, this is a bunch of crap.
I am an urban informant. I am not a snitch.

1035
01:13:40,563 --> 01:13:44,294
- Come on, Huggy, what's the difference?
- A snitch wears a wire.

1036
01:13:44,466 --> 01:13:47,333
A snitch is the scum
of the information industry.

1037
01:13:47,503 --> 01:13:50,904
A snitch has no soul.
Damn, man, that shit hurt.

1038
01:13:51,073 --> 01:13:53,371
- I'm sorry.
- You got to be more careful.

1039
01:13:53,542 --> 01:13:56,978
We wouldn't ask you to do this
unless it was really important.

1040
01:13:57,146 --> 01:13:59,478
- I'm gonna owe you one.
- More than one, man.

1041
01:13:59,648 --> 01:14:02,776
Let's slow down with the scorekeeping.
I might remember...

1042
01:14:02,952 --> 01:14:06,945
...stuff I've overlooked over the years,
then mention it to my partner here.

1043
01:14:08,557 --> 01:14:10,252
How'd that be?

1044
01:14:12,094 --> 01:14:16,656
- All right, man, get this over with. Hurry up.
- All right. All right. Good. We're done.

1045
01:14:16,832 --> 01:14:19,630
- All right, let's get that outfit.
- Outfit?

1046
01:14:21,403 --> 01:14:24,770
Oh, no, man. You know Huggy Bear
wouldn't wear that, man.

1047
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:28,205
Come with something better.
Take that shit back to Florida.

1048
01:14:28,377 --> 01:14:29,844
That ain't me, baby.

1049
01:14:35,751 --> 01:14:38,276
Mr. Casual. So nice of you to join us.

1050
01:14:38,721 --> 01:14:40,882
Sorry about that, sir.

1051
01:14:41,523 --> 01:14:43,423
What would you say this is?

1052
01:14:45,094 --> 01:14:46,584
Golf?

1053
01:14:47,229 --> 01:14:50,027
Real funny, Amos.
Give me the 9-iron.

1054
01:14:56,672 --> 01:14:59,505
- Where the hell's my 9-iron?
- I was gonna bring...

1055
01:14:59,675 --> 01:15:01,643
Let me explain something to you.

1056
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:04,643
You are in charge
of this area right here.

1057
01:15:05,214 --> 01:15:07,205
Clubs come out.
They gotta go back in.

1058
01:15:07,383 --> 01:15:11,945
I realize this is a complex procedure, but it's
up to you to manage the whole business.

1059
01:15:12,121 --> 01:15:13,383
Do you got that, Nipsey?

1060
01:15:14,189 --> 01:15:15,816
- Yes.
- I should make you run...

1061
01:15:15,991 --> 01:15:20,189
...back to the driving range and get it.
Just give me the wedge.

1062
01:15:24,934 --> 01:15:27,562
3-wood?
My man gave me a 3-wood.

1063
01:15:28,504 --> 01:15:30,734
Do you even know what
a pitching wedge is?

1064
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:32,999
- Are you even a real caddy?
- Come on.

1065
01:15:33,175 --> 01:15:38,841
Look, man, this grass is
Alabama Creeping Bent...

1066
01:15:39,114 --> 01:15:41,344
...as opposed to Georgia Creeping Bent.

1067
01:15:42,351 --> 01:15:44,046
It's lighter.

1068
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,421
- Lighter meaning faster?
- Exactly.

1069
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:53,087
Hold this.

1070
01:15:58,367 --> 01:16:00,267
Look at that. Good shot.

1071
01:16:05,975 --> 01:16:09,604
- You know a lot about golf.
- I know even more about grass.

1072
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:11,541
I don't question that.

1073
01:16:11,714 --> 01:16:15,206
- That was a great shot. Don't even start.
- Fine. Back to business.

1074
01:16:15,384 --> 01:16:18,581
The stuff is all ready to be moved.
All two tons of it.

1075
01:16:18,754 --> 01:16:22,212
We're gold. We need to be at
the banquet by 2 p.m. Anything else?

1076
01:16:22,391 --> 01:16:24,086
Yeah, just stay calm and...

1077
01:16:24,259 --> 01:16:27,422
What, are we dating?
Why are you standing so close to me?

1078
01:16:27,596 --> 01:16:30,429
- Back off.
- It's cool, baby.

1079
01:16:31,533 --> 01:16:33,262
What is your deal?

1080
01:16:36,505 --> 01:16:39,201
The Nearly There banquet.
Remember? It's tomorrow.

1081
01:16:39,375 --> 01:16:43,641
- How's he gonna move coke at a banquet?
- I don't know, but we gotta be there.

1082
01:16:43,812 --> 01:16:46,610
No, can't. He'll kill us if he sees us.

1083
01:16:49,118 --> 01:16:51,780
You wanna use my wig guy.

1084
01:17:40,903 --> 01:17:44,634
Hello, sir. May I check your briefcase?

1085
01:17:46,675 --> 01:17:49,508
Oh, yeah. Thanks a lot.

1086
01:17:56,652 --> 01:17:58,643
Thank you very much.

1087
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:03,957
Now, what you wanna do is take
this ticket stub. It's for the raffle.

1088
01:18:04,126 --> 01:18:06,993
And see that car up on stage?

1089
01:18:07,663 --> 01:18:13,363
There's seven of them, all up for grabs,
with plenty of trunk space.

1090
01:18:17,005 --> 01:18:23,137
Trunk space. I get it. Very good.
Very good. Thank you very much.

1091
01:18:35,124 --> 01:18:39,356
- That's what I'm talking about. Right here.
- There we go.

1092
01:18:39,528 --> 01:18:42,691
- What do you think?
- I love it. Great stuff.

1093
01:18:42,865 --> 01:18:46,426
Yeah, you look just like a rich cowboy,
came riding in off the farm.

1094
01:18:46,602 --> 01:18:50,094
- Do me a favor. Tip your hat forward.
- No, I like it where it is.

1095
01:18:50,272 --> 01:18:54,368
- No, seriously, come on, do it. Do it.
- Will you stop with that?

1096
01:18:54,543 --> 01:18:56,636
That voice makes you sound crazy.

1097
01:18:56,812 --> 01:18:58,905
It makes me sound like Maury Finkel...

1098
01:18:59,081 --> 01:19:02,073
...founder of Finkel Fixtures,
a lighting fixture chain.

1099
01:19:02,251 --> 01:19:06,551
Oh, it's a little voice and a character.
You got a whole back-story. That's good.

1100
01:19:06,722 --> 01:19:09,452
Little touches. You wanna
make the character real.

1101
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:12,355
- What's your character?
- I don't really...

1102
01:19:12,528 --> 01:19:15,088
I don't have a character.
I don't do voices.

1103
01:19:15,664 --> 01:19:19,964
We're going upstairs. People will
recognize us if we don't have a character.

1104
01:19:20,135 --> 01:19:21,864
- Think of something.
- Okay.

1105
01:19:22,037 --> 01:19:23,299
Buck up, let's do it.

1106
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:27,533
How are you? How's it going?

1107
01:19:27,709 --> 01:19:31,475
All right. How you doing? All right.

1108
01:19:31,647 --> 01:19:35,913
Look at these two hot chickens.
Finkel wants some dinkle. Give it to me.

1109
01:19:36,084 --> 01:19:40,612
Come on. Do it.
Lay it on, right here. Do it. Do it.

1110
01:19:40,789 --> 01:19:43,656
He means a kiss. We're doing
little voices. Undercover.

1111
01:19:43,825 --> 01:19:45,087
Come on, sweetie. Do it.

1112
01:19:45,827 --> 01:19:49,490
- That's a sweet little pucker. I love it.
- Can I get you two a drink?

1113
01:19:49,665 --> 01:19:52,099
You sure can, sweetheart.
Johnnie Red, neat.

1114
01:19:52,267 --> 01:19:53,996
- Okay.
- Do it. Do it.

1115
01:19:55,003 --> 01:19:56,800
All right. And you?

1116
01:19:59,775 --> 01:20:05,577
- Do it. Bacardi and cola. Do it, do it.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

1117
01:20:05,747 --> 01:20:07,214
- What are you doing?
- What?

1118
01:20:07,382 --> 01:20:10,374
- What was that? You just stole my voice.
- No, I didn't.

1119
01:20:10,552 --> 01:20:13,578
You gotta come up with your own voice.
That's my thing.

1120
01:20:13,755 --> 01:20:17,054
- I don't have a cool voice like you.
- Come up with a character.

1121
01:20:17,226 --> 01:20:20,957
You're a Texas oil tycoon guy.
You have, like, a moustache...

1122
01:20:21,129 --> 01:20:23,029
Don't shame me.

1123
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:24,631
Let's sit down. Come on.

1124
01:20:24,967 --> 01:20:30,269
So we can get down to business and then
get back to the business of getting down.

1125
01:20:30,439 --> 01:20:34,000
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
Let's get down!

1126
01:20:35,677 --> 01:20:37,668
Captain Doby, you're not right.

1127
01:20:39,681 --> 01:20:43,276
But today is right.
Can I see a show of hands?

1128
01:20:43,452 --> 01:20:46,353
I'm talking to everyone in this room.

1129
01:20:46,521 --> 01:20:48,489
How many of us have made a mistake?

1130
01:20:48,657 --> 01:20:50,022
- Guilty.
- Yeah.

1131
01:20:50,792 --> 01:20:54,523
You know, I believe it was our buddy
Bill Shakespeare who said...

1132
01:20:54,696 --> 01:21:00,657
..."To err is human, but to forgive,
well, that's right on."

1133
01:21:00,836 --> 01:21:02,804
That's exactly why
we're here today.

1134
01:21:02,971 --> 01:21:06,702
Because everyone out there
deserves a second chance. Everyone.

1135
01:21:08,577 --> 01:21:12,604
Thank you. I didn't say it.
Bill Shakespeare did.

1136
01:21:13,181 --> 01:21:15,445
Some of these guys were
in our surveillance.

1137
01:21:15,617 --> 01:21:18,381
- I know.
- Check out the guy behind us.

1138
01:21:18,553 --> 01:21:20,282
Already did.

1139
01:21:20,656 --> 01:21:23,147
You think he's got the stuff here?

1140
01:21:24,426 --> 01:21:27,725
- Where?
- I'd like to thank Bay City Volkswagen...

1141
01:21:27,896 --> 01:21:33,493
...for donating seven brand-new cars
to our annual fundraising raffle.

1142
01:21:33,669 --> 01:21:35,569
Thank you, Bay City Volkswagen.

1143
01:21:35,737 --> 01:21:39,468
Okay, everybody. Go ahead,
pull out your ticket stubs.

1144
01:21:39,641 --> 01:21:43,771
Hope you held onto it. Hate to have your
number called and have it left behind.

1145
01:21:43,945 --> 01:21:46,778
Because this train's
leaving the station.

1146
01:21:54,956 --> 01:21:58,050
Tonight's first winner. 63.

1147
01:21:58,226 --> 01:22:01,093
- Hot damn, that baby's mine!
- Congratulations.

1148
01:22:01,263 --> 01:22:02,628
That's one of his guys.

1149
01:22:02,964 --> 01:22:04,932
- Thank you very much.
- Just wait here.

1150
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:08,194
We've got a winner, a new car owner.
Let him hear it.

1151
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:10,167
He's gonna ride home in class.

1152
01:22:10,339 --> 01:22:13,900
The car. Cocaine is in the car.
He's doing it in front of everybody.

1153
01:22:14,076 --> 01:22:17,603
- He's not that stupid.
- No, but he's that arrogant. Trust me.

1154
01:22:17,779 --> 01:22:20,043
Number 117.

1155
01:22:20,515 --> 01:22:22,312
- Go.
- Right on! Yeah.

1156
01:22:23,452 --> 01:22:24,714
Yes!

1157
01:22:26,321 --> 01:22:30,883
- Thank you very much.
- Sit. Now. Do it. Do it.

1158
01:22:31,059 --> 01:22:35,462
Old Shakes McGinty did it!
Yes! Unbelievable!

1159
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:38,326
I'm a-richer, and I'm gonna kiss you.

1160
01:22:39,034 --> 01:22:41,161
Get your hands off. I think...
I don't...

1161
01:22:41,336 --> 01:22:44,066
My friend won. Give him the car. Do it.

1162
01:22:44,373 --> 01:22:46,398
- Do what?
- The kid's from Texas.

1163
01:22:46,575 --> 01:22:49,237
I don't know if he has a license.
He rides a horse.

1164
01:22:49,411 --> 01:22:52,312
Do you have a ticket?
I need it to give you the car.

1165
01:22:52,481 --> 01:22:55,041
- You gotta trust the kid.
- I can't, cowboy.

1166
01:22:55,217 --> 01:22:56,912
I need to see the ticket.

1167
01:22:57,085 --> 01:22:59,645
Pop the trunk.
Let's get that new car smell.

1168
01:22:59,821 --> 01:23:02,847
- Who wants a whiff of that new car smell?
- Let's smell it!

1169
01:23:03,024 --> 01:23:09,327
That's what I'm talking about. Come on.
Pop the trunk. Seriously, do it. Do it.

1170
01:23:10,365 --> 01:23:13,232
- Do it.
- Listen, jackass.

1171
01:23:13,402 --> 01:23:17,304
Either give me a ticket or get the
hell off the stage. You dig that?

1172
01:23:17,472 --> 01:23:20,339
- Guys.
- Pop the trunk, candy man.

1173
01:23:22,277 --> 01:23:24,074
You heard him.

1174
01:23:24,679 --> 01:23:25,941
Pop it.

1175
01:23:26,114 --> 01:23:28,105
What the hell are you two doing?

1176
01:23:28,283 --> 01:23:30,080
Pop it!

1177
01:23:30,252 --> 01:23:32,982
You screwed it up once already, Starsky.

1178
01:23:35,857 --> 01:23:39,190
Like you said, Feldman,
everyone deserves a second chance.

1179
01:23:41,563 --> 01:23:44,532
What have we here?

1180
01:23:44,699 --> 01:23:47,793
Does this look familiar? Some cocaine.

1181
01:23:47,969 --> 01:23:51,837
Captain Doby, I suggest you take
this to the lab, get it analyzed...

1182
01:23:52,007 --> 01:23:54,441
- Hutch!
- All right, freeze! Everybody, freeze!

1183
01:23:54,609 --> 01:23:58,511
- Put your hands where I can see them!
- Relax, pal. Relax!

1184
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:01,877
- Let's do it!
- Put that gun down or I'll kill your friend.

1185
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:05,042
- Reese, what are we doing?
- Do it now! Put it down!

1186
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:07,211
I got a clean shot.
I need permission.

1187
01:24:07,389 --> 01:24:09,550
No! No, Starsky.

1188
01:24:09,724 --> 01:24:12,056
I can do it. Just move
your head to the left.

1189
01:24:12,227 --> 01:24:17,062
No can do. You don't have my permission,
partner. I can't give it to you.

1190
01:24:17,232 --> 01:24:21,362
- Your nuts are mine, Feldman.
- No, they're not! Your nuts are yours.

1191
01:24:21,536 --> 01:24:25,836
Starsky, listen to me. I don't wanna die.
And I'm not giving you my permission.

1192
01:24:26,408 --> 01:24:28,535
Please, put it down.

1193
01:24:29,945 --> 01:24:32,641
Put it down. Down.

1194
01:24:35,717 --> 01:24:38,185
Okay. All right. You're right.
It's too close.

1195
01:24:38,353 --> 01:24:40,344
Oh, thank God.

1196
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:45,592
Stay down!

1197
01:24:48,396 --> 01:24:49,795
Doby?

1198
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:53,690
- Come on, let's move it! Let's go!
- What?

1199
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:56,497
Walk away. Walk away. Let's go.

1200
01:24:56,671 --> 01:24:59,469
- Cap, are you okay?
- Yeah, I just got my wing clipped.

1201
01:24:59,641 --> 01:25:02,576
- Who the hell shot me?
- I'm sorry. I was trying to get...

1202
01:25:02,744 --> 01:25:06,578
Starsky! It was Reese Feldman.
Reese Feldman hit you, the son of a bitch.

1203
01:25:06,748 --> 01:25:08,773
Well, go get him!

1204
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:12,147
- Is somebody coming?
- No, we're on vacation.

1205
01:25:12,454 --> 01:25:13,921
- What's going on?
- Gotta go.

1206
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:17,515
Oh, my God!

1207
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:21,559
- Baby, look out!
- Look, I wanna hit him!

1208
01:25:22,731 --> 01:25:24,699
- You okay?
- Yeah!

1209
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:41,606
- Watch out for the bunker!
- I don't know what a bunker is!

1210
01:25:41,783 --> 01:25:43,614
It's a sand trap.

1211
01:25:46,821 --> 01:25:49,449
- Go faster!
- I'm going fast. I got it floored.

1212
01:25:53,128 --> 01:25:55,790
- Dogleg right up here on the par three.
- What?

1213
01:25:55,964 --> 01:25:57,864
- Watch the bunker!
- What bunker?

1214
01:25:58,033 --> 01:25:59,500
Jesus!

1215
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:03,534
Come on. Pay attention.

1216
01:26:05,807 --> 01:26:08,298
Hey! Get out of here!

1217
01:26:14,549 --> 01:26:17,541
- Move that ice cream truck now!
- No, you move.

1218
01:26:17,719 --> 01:26:20,483
- Bay City P.D. Move it!
- Let's go.

1219
01:26:20,655 --> 01:26:23,852
Grab those and meet me
in the marina. Let's go. Move!

1220
01:26:24,025 --> 01:26:26,516
If you guys are cops,
let's see some badge.

1221
01:26:27,729 --> 01:26:30,892
- We don't have any badges.
- Show him your gun.

1222
01:26:32,667 --> 01:26:34,032
Come on! Come on, move!

1223
01:26:45,814 --> 01:26:49,841
- Come on, hurry up, let's go!
- They're coming!

1224
01:26:50,018 --> 01:26:54,148
Come on, these two with the running
and the chasing. Stop! Go home.

1225
01:26:55,357 --> 01:26:56,847
Goodbye, heroes!

1226
01:26:57,025 --> 01:26:58,856
- To the shipping yard!
- Got a boat?

1227
01:26:59,027 --> 01:27:01,188
- No, but I got an idea.

1228
01:27:17,345 --> 01:27:18,676
Hey, watch out!

1229
01:27:23,785 --> 01:27:26,720
- Okay, now what?
- Okay, we're gonna take this car...

1230
01:27:26,888 --> 01:27:29,186
...and land it on that boat.

1231
01:27:32,127 --> 01:27:36,461
- You wanna crash the car into his boat?
- No, I wanna land it on that boat.

1232
01:27:36,631 --> 01:27:38,599
Now, go.

1233
01:27:40,669 --> 01:27:42,728
- Go!
- I can't do it.

1234
01:27:42,904 --> 01:27:46,305
This is unbelievable. Here you get
me out here to risk my life...

1235
01:27:46,474 --> 01:27:49,773
...and now you tell me you
can't do this? I'm a quitter, but...

1236
01:27:51,379 --> 01:27:55,645
- You're crying again.
- I'm not crying. This is different.

1237
01:27:56,651 --> 01:28:02,521
It's my mother. She always used to say that
this was too much car for me to handle.

1238
01:28:02,691 --> 01:28:06,058
- She said that?
- Couldn't handle the V8.

1239
01:28:06,928 --> 01:28:12,491
- I don't know, maybe she was right.
- Hey, look at me. Look at me.

1240
01:28:12,834 --> 01:28:16,565
I am not your mother.
I'm your partner.

1241
01:28:17,772 --> 01:28:19,603
Now, go!

1242
01:28:21,142 --> 01:28:22,803
Go!

1243
01:28:26,414 --> 01:28:30,111
- Things could go pretty wrong, so l...
- Keep your eyes on the road.

1244
01:28:30,285 --> 01:28:35,587
Listen to me, Ken. If we don't make it,
this... You know, us...

1245
01:28:36,825 --> 01:28:39,521
- It's been good.
- It's been great.

1246
01:28:39,694 --> 01:28:42,492
Now, will you stop talking
and hit that boat.

1247
01:28:42,664 --> 01:28:45,690
It's not a boat, it's a yacht.

1248
01:28:55,276 --> 01:28:57,403
Son of a bitch!

1249
01:28:59,114 --> 01:29:03,881
- Come on, are you kidding me?
- Oh, my God. We almost just got killed.

1250
01:29:04,052 --> 01:29:08,148
Thanks for pointing out something
I couldn't notice. You're a benefit to have.

1251
01:29:08,323 --> 01:29:10,689
We should save them.

1252
01:29:15,663 --> 01:29:18,359
- Son of a bitch!
- Nice plan!

1253
01:29:18,533 --> 01:29:21,434
You gave it too much gas
and you overshot it.

1254
01:29:21,603 --> 01:29:26,506
- Car has a lot of horsepower. I'll go get it.
- What are you doing? Stop it.

1255
01:29:28,710 --> 01:29:30,610
Starsky!

1256
01:29:31,813 --> 01:29:36,512
- It hasn't hit the bottom yet.
- Stop, stop, damn it! Listen to me.

1257
01:29:36,684 --> 01:29:40,120
It's gone, okay? It's over.

1258
01:29:40,488 --> 01:29:44,447
- But it's my car.
- I know it is, partner. I know it is.

1259
01:29:50,031 --> 01:29:52,966
Oh, my God, honey.
That was so incredible.

1260
01:29:53,134 --> 01:29:55,500
I feel like my adrenaline is just...

1261
01:29:55,670 --> 01:29:58,935
You and me, babe. We are such
a good team, don't you think?

1262
01:29:59,107 --> 01:30:04,977
I mean, this is just the beginning. We could
go so far, honey. I feel so exhilarated.

1263
01:30:05,146 --> 01:30:06,738
- Come on!
- What was that?

1264
01:30:06,915 --> 01:30:09,213
Son of a bitch.

1265
01:30:10,785 --> 01:30:12,582
What is it, Reese?

1266
01:30:18,626 --> 01:30:20,218
Who are you?

1267
01:30:21,029 --> 01:30:22,758
I found your 9-iron, bitch.

1268
01:30:26,134 --> 01:30:31,595
That's for putting hands on Huggy Bear.
Nobody touches the Bear, you dig?

1269
01:30:34,342 --> 01:30:37,937
Yeah. Now, these will work.

1270
01:30:38,346 --> 01:30:41,076
What have we here?

1271
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:47,117
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

1272
01:30:57,465 --> 01:31:01,697
- We don't really do private shows.
- But I'm a good friend of Huggy Bear.

1273
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:07,035
- It's kind of against cheerleading policy.
- You need to change that policy.

1274
01:31:07,208 --> 01:31:09,233
You know what I can't figure out?

1275
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:11,810
How the hell did you know
to get on that boat?

1276
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:15,541
When your two boys put me on
that undercover golf course mission...

1277
01:31:15,717 --> 01:31:19,949
...that cat, Reese? All he did
was talk about that damn yacht.

1278
01:31:20,121 --> 01:31:25,081
And like I say, why go to the starting line
when you can go straight to the finish?

1279
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:28,696
"Straight to the finish."
I like that, man. I like that.

1280
01:31:28,863 --> 01:31:31,661
Are you interested in doing
any undercover work?

1281
01:31:31,833 --> 01:31:34,825
- Not the least.
- Captain, let me borrow him for a second.

1282
01:31:35,003 --> 01:31:40,441
The weird thing is, one of those briefcases
with $5 million just up and vanished.

1283
01:31:41,109 --> 01:31:44,169
Oh, what is this, a brand-new fur coat?
Look at this thing.

1284
01:31:44,345 --> 01:31:47,246
Yeah, I inherited some money
from a dead uncle of mine.

1285
01:31:47,415 --> 01:31:50,179
Is that right? I didn't even
know you had an uncle.

1286
01:31:50,351 --> 01:31:54,617
Well, I did.
And he was rich as hell too, baby.

1287
01:31:55,757 --> 01:31:59,659
- Chin up, little man.
- I think he's still upset about the car.

1288
01:31:59,827 --> 01:32:02,159
Come on, let's get up.
You're going outside.

1289
01:32:02,330 --> 01:32:04,423
- No, thanks.
- We're taking you out.

1290
01:32:04,599 --> 01:32:08,057
- We're gonna get you cleaned up.
- I don't feel like it.

1291
01:32:12,507 --> 01:32:16,705
I know these two white dudes that got
a car that you might be interested in.

1292
01:32:16,878 --> 01:32:21,178
- I don't want another car, Hug.
- Come on, at least take a look.

1293
01:32:24,052 --> 01:32:27,385
My car. Where did you...?

1294
01:32:35,563 --> 01:32:37,622
Hey, Hutch, who the hell
are these guys?

1295
01:32:37,799 --> 01:32:40,359
I don't know, but I get
a good vibe from them.

1296
01:32:43,171 --> 01:32:44,433
So you selling the car?

1297
01:32:44,605 --> 01:32:47,699
Well, actually, your friend here
has already paid for it.

1298
01:32:50,011 --> 01:32:52,206
I owe you one, Huggy.

1299
01:32:53,481 --> 01:32:57,508
- All right.
- Come on, give him the keys.

1300
01:33:03,358 --> 01:33:06,054
Thank you. Thank you.

1301
01:33:06,294 --> 01:33:09,627
With this transmission,
you really wanna jump the clutch.

1302
01:33:09,797 --> 01:33:12,357
- I usually...
- From second to fourth. I got it.

1303
01:33:12,533 --> 01:33:15,001
- Right.
- Come in, Zebra 3. We have a 420.

1304
01:33:15,169 --> 01:33:17,034
Please respond.

1305
01:33:20,541 --> 01:33:24,637
This is Zebra 3. We're on it.
Hutch, let's roll.

1306
01:33:24,812 --> 01:33:26,803
I think he means you.

1307
01:33:28,082 --> 01:33:30,482
- Good luck.
- Allow me.

1308
01:33:30,651 --> 01:33:33,211
- All right, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1309
01:33:33,621 --> 01:33:35,179
All right.

1310
01:33:35,356 --> 01:33:36,789
Hey!

1311
01:33:37,425 --> 01:33:39,518
Not the...

1312
01:33:41,929 --> 01:33:45,194
- How does it feel?
- It feels pretty good.

1313
01:33:45,366 --> 01:33:47,596
I'm gonna take it slow,
get the feel of it.

1314
01:33:47,769 --> 01:33:49,430
No, no, that's smart. Do that.

1315
01:33:54,776 --> 01:33:56,107
- Starsky.
- Hang on.

1316
01:33:57,311 --> 01:33:59,939
- No. No!
- Hang on!

1317
01:33:59,939 --> 01:34:09,939
