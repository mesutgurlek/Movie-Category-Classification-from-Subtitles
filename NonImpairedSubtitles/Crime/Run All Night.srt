1
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:45,085
I've done terrible things
in my life.

2
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,089
Things for which I can
never be forgiven.

3
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,000
I betrayed friends,

4
00:00:51,657 --> 00:00:55,794
turned my back on the ones
closest to me.

5
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:56,795
Gabriela!

6
00:00:59,398 --> 00:01:00,867
I've always known that my sins

7
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:03,553
would eventually
catch up to me.

8
00:01:03,554 --> 00:01:07,284
No sin goes unpunished
in this life.

9
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:15,246
Your life doesn't flash before
your eyes when you're dying.

10
00:01:15,247 --> 00:01:16,887
That's bullshit.

11
00:01:16,912 --> 00:01:21,750
It's your regrets that haunt
you in your final moments.

12
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:24,571
Everything you failed to be.

13
00:01:25,187 --> 00:01:27,417
Everyone you let down.

14
00:01:27,657 --> 00:01:28,657
Run!

15
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,793
Everything you'd go back
and change

16
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:35,484
if only you had more time.

17
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:43,796
Look who's up.
Sleeping beauty.

18
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:47,372
You were fartin' in your sleep
again, you know that, conlon?

19
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,540
How would I know that, dickhead?
I was sleepin'.

20
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,411
More like dead to the world.

21
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:54,829
Danny in yet?

22
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,878
In the office.

23
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,998
Uh-oh, here he goes.

24
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:58,391
Oh, he's fucked.

25
00:01:58,392 --> 00:01:59,762
Here he goes.

26
00:02:02,652 --> 00:02:05,088
And he's chasin' her
around the house

27
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:06,354
with his thing all night.

28
00:02:06,355 --> 00:02:09,125
Finally she goes,
"How is titty-fucking me

29
00:02:09,126 --> 00:02:11,192
gonna make my tits
any bigger?"

30
00:02:11,193 --> 00:02:13,363
Boyfriend says,
"hey, baby, it beats me,

31
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:16,144
but it worked on your ass."

32
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:19,633
All right, there you go.
Merry Christmas.

33
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:21,935
I appreciate that,
Danny. Thank you.

34
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:23,269
All right, get outta here.

35
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,839
Shit, shower and shave time
for me.

36
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,005
Hot date tonight?

37
00:02:26,006 --> 00:02:27,807
Little grab-ass
under the mistletoe?

38
00:02:27,808 --> 00:02:28,808
I wish.

39
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,810
- I'm introducin' my father to some
new business partners. - Oh, yeah?

40
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:33,496
Been workin' on it
for about nine months

41
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:35,356
and finally he agrees
to hear me out.

42
00:02:35,357 --> 00:02:37,182
Hey, well, he's a busy man,
your father.

43
00:02:37,183 --> 00:02:38,783
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no shit.

44
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,769
- All right. See ya later, fellas.
- All right, see ya.

45
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,590
- Hey, guys.
- What's up, Jimmy? How you doin'?

46
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:53,063
Christ! Can I get one moment
to myself?

47
00:02:53,064 --> 00:02:54,204
Hey, Danny.

48
00:02:54,297 --> 00:02:56,697
Hey.
What-what do you want?

49
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:58,599
Uh, I talked to your father
this mornin'

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,703
and, uh, the-the heater
blew over at my place.

51
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:02,804
He, uh, told me to ask you
about a loan.

52
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:03,970
- A loan?
- Yeah.

53
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:05,338
Or a handout?

54
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:06,672
Naw, it's-it's just a loan.

55
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:09,310
Why he keeps you around,
I got no idea.

56
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:10,810
All right.
How much do you need?

57
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:12,511
Uh...About eight hundred.

58
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,848
I don't know what "about
eight hundred" means, Jimmy.

59
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,266
Give me a number.

60
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:17,677
Eight hundred?

61
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,571
Eight hundred.

62
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:21,952
- All right.
- Thanks, Danny.

63
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:23,421
Oh...Jee- you know...

64
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:26,959
Mccauley, he- the son
of a bitch canceled on me.

65
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,280
I need a Santa for a Christmas
party this afternoon.

66
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:33,998
Santa claus?

67
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:34,999
Yeah.

68
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,233
Aw, jeez, Danny, I-

69
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:37,266
you'll be great.

70
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:38,535
Find someone else, huh?
I gotta get home.

71
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:41,488
Yeah.
I'll get somebody else.

72
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,407
You freeze
your little nuts off.

73
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:45,958
Come on, Danny.

74
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:48,076
Hm?

75
00:04:07,592 --> 00:04:09,929
You see that?
You see that switch?

76
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:10,995
- I switch, and then I get out.
- Yeah.

77
00:04:10,996 --> 00:04:12,162
And then you're out.

78
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:13,797
- You control him with the jab.
- Yeah.

79
00:04:13,798 --> 00:04:16,199
- All right?
- Right. - Put the phone down.

80
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,836
Watch me with your own eyes.
Okay?

81
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:20,797
What the fuck, man?

82
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:26,144
Oh, shit! Yo!

83
00:04:30,012 --> 00:04:32,202
Yo, look at his face.

84
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:33,355
Sorry, man.

85
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:35,983
Get the fuck outta here.

86
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,050
You started it.

87
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:38,518
Aw, walk of shame.

88
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,854
Yo, Mike, you knocked him
the fuck out.

89
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:42,890
Hey, what'd I tell you
about talkin' like that?

90
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:43,891
My bust.

91
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:46,658
- See how I kept my elbows tight?
- Yeah, I saw 'em.

92
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,060
You gotta be careful
fighting garrity.

93
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:50,062
He's gonna wanna push you
against the ropes.

94
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:51,529
Just give him one-a these.

95
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,767
Knock his shit-talkin' mouth
right out.

96
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:55,588
Sorry. It slipped.

97
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,220
Go ahead, legs.

98
00:04:57,502 --> 00:05:00,839
Gonna find out real soon
how fast it can all slip away.

99
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,237
Relax, Mike.
I was just messing around.

100
00:05:03,238 --> 00:05:06,661
That's your problem. You got
all the talent in the world

101
00:05:06,662 --> 00:05:10,011
and all you wanna do is mess around.

102
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:14,651
I'm told that you're a man
of influence, Mr. Maguire,

103
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:17,085
and that nothing moves in or out
of this borough

104
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:18,519
without your approval.

105
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,790
And my employers are, uh,
looking for a partner

106
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,326
to help bring our product
into the city.

107
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:26,828
We use our contacts
in the union, pop.

108
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:27,961
Three bins a month,

109
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:30,198
dockworkers know which bins
are comin' in

110
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,233
and all they gotta do
is make sure

111
00:05:32,234 --> 00:05:34,234
they pass through
without inspection.

112
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:37,235
What exactly
is your product?

113
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:38,971
Heroin.

114
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,207
99% pure.

115
00:05:42,374 --> 00:05:43,975
The very best in the world.

116
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,878
And my son told you
I'd be interested in this?

117
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,469
Very interested.

118
00:05:51,682 --> 00:05:54,451
The business has changed,
Mr. grezda.

119
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:57,187
Twenty years ago,
I made a living

120
00:05:57,188 --> 00:05:58,689
the same way we all did.

121
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,207
Couple big scores a year,

122
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,656
but mostly I was a grinder.

123
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:04,326
Now, you want to lay down
on a few ballgames,

124
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:05,526
you came to me.

125
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:07,927
You want to open up
a butcher shop

126
00:06:07,928 --> 00:06:11,767
and the bank said "fuck you"
on a loan, you came to me.

127
00:06:11,768 --> 00:06:14,301
You know what that butcher shop
is today?

128
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:15,302
Mm, no.

129
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:17,729
An applebee's.

130
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,540
Why are you
telling me this?

131
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,611
Because I've had to adapt
to the times.

132
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:28,112
I am a legitimate
businessman now.

133
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,016
I know
your business, Mr. Maguire.

134
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:33,167
That's why I'm here.

135
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:34,850
You're wasting your time.

136
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:36,919
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
Wait!

137
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,192
Come on, now. Pop, just listen
to what he has to say.

138
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,577
You haven't heard
the offer yet.

139
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:44,320
Two million dollars
up front.

140
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,994
After that,
you'll receive 20%

141
00:06:45,995 --> 00:06:48,464
of all the product you allow
to pass safely through the port.

142
00:06:48,465 --> 00:06:50,155
The answer's no.

143
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:53,935
Take the night
to think it over.

144
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:56,138
Once you've considered it
more carefully,

145
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:58,271
you'll realize the mistake
you are making.

146
00:06:58,272 --> 00:07:02,976
How do you think I survived
in this business for 35 years?

147
00:07:02,977 --> 00:07:04,810
Everyone I came up with
is either dead

148
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:07,381
or locked up in federal prison
waitin' to be buried.

149
00:07:07,382 --> 00:07:09,662
I don't make mistakes.

150
00:07:14,586 --> 00:07:16,636
It's Christmas time.

151
00:07:17,322 --> 00:07:19,524
My friends are here
to celebrate with me.

152
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:22,485
Get the fuck
outta my house.

153
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:27,365
Take this shit with ya.

154
00:07:36,705 --> 00:07:38,908
Guys. My old man. I don't even
know what just happened.

155
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:41,543
We paid you to guarantee
your father's support.

156
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,611
Just let me talk to him,
all right?

157
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:43,944
I'll get it all figured out.

158
00:07:43,945 --> 00:07:46,013
I'll be stopping by
your house tonight...

159
00:07:46,014 --> 00:07:47,480
To pick up our money.

160
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:51,418
You know what happens
if you don't have it.

161
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:52,551
Merry Christmas.

162
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:54,732
Merry Christmas, guys.

163
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:58,224
Fucking garbage.
I hate Albanians.

164
00:07:58,225 --> 00:08:00,595
What the fuck was that?

165
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:02,795
Did you even listen
to what he had to say?

166
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:05,796
That's not our business,
Danny.

167
00:08:05,797 --> 00:08:10,167
Shut your mouth.
I'm talkin' to my father.

168
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:11,668
What's the problem, Danny?

169
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:15,405
The problem is,
all I ever hear outta your mouth

170
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:17,539
is when am I gonna pull
my weight?

171
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,342
And now I bring you
a piece of business...

172
00:08:19,343 --> 00:08:20,975
A good piece of business-

173
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:23,409
and you're mad because I let it
walk out the door.

174
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,082
- Yeah. - When I was younger, somebody
made me the same proposal.

175
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:29,549
- Mm. - I made so much money bringing
cocaine into the city,

176
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,753
I had to rent a storage unit
to store all the cash.

177
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:33,922
The problem was, everybody
got hooked on the shit.

178
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:35,941
I watched my friends rot away
in front of me

179
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:37,890
until I couldn't recognize
them anymore.

180
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:43,694
I had to kill people I loved
because I couldn't trust them.

181
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:46,833
Not enough money in the world
to pull me back in.

182
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:50,654
Pop, I made promises
to these people.

183
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:52,538
I can't just walk away.

184
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,605
- You made a mess.
- Mm.

185
00:08:54,606 --> 00:08:59,476
It's time somebody other than me
cleaned it up.

186
00:09:15,757 --> 00:09:19,207
One, two...
Three...Four...Five...

187
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:21,759
Lily, what are you doin'
in here?

188
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,098
- ...six, seven, eight...
- Shh! I'm hiding from catelyn.

189
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:26,509
...nine...Ten.

190
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,913
- Is she in here?
- Is who in here?

191
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:33,694
She's over there.

192
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:37,541
I see you.

193
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,770
It doesn't count!
You have to tag me!

194
00:09:39,771 --> 00:09:41,743
- I said I see you.
- Doesn't count unless you tag her.

195
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:43,782
- Hey. - It doesn't count
unless you tag her.

196
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:44,978
You didn't touch her.

197
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:46,515
- Tag!
- You got tagged.

198
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:48,051
Didn't I tell you girls
to get ready?

199
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:49,553
We're going to
your uncle Ricky's house.

200
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:51,372
Go on.
Get your butts in that room.

201
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,121
- I thought you were off tonight.
- I was.

202
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:55,525
Till somebody broke her wrist
fallin' off-a the jungle gym.

203
00:09:55,526 --> 00:09:57,092
So you're not comin' to Ricky's
for dinner?

204
00:09:57,093 --> 00:09:59,224
I can pay the hospital bill
or go to Ricky's for dinner.

205
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:00,629
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to do what you promised.

206
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,162
And you said Friday-

207
00:10:02,163 --> 00:10:04,900
don't tell me what I said.
I know what I said.

208
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:07,066
Fine. I don't want you there anyway

209
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:09,003
if you're gonna act
like an asshole.

210
00:10:09,004 --> 00:10:10,374
Hey! Come on.

211
00:10:11,973 --> 00:10:12,973
Hey.

212
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:14,439
Mnh. Mnh.

213
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:15,925
Come on.

214
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:18,009
- I'm sorry.
- You better be.

215
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,044
- What're you working on?
- It's for the baby.

216
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:23,015
Show him what our lives
were like

217
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:26,566
before he came along.
You like it?

218
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,123
I'm sorry.
I forgot to take it out.

219
00:10:32,124 --> 00:10:33,959
No, it's all right.

220
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
There.

221
00:10:36,092 --> 00:10:41,422
Now I won't have to see him
for another five years.

222
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:43,891
We want Santa!

223
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,333
Jimmy?

224
00:10:47,135 --> 00:10:49,187
Kids are waitin' for you.

225
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:51,878
Yeah, I know.
I'm comin'.

226
00:10:57,177 --> 00:11:02,014
- And a bitty baby and a Barbie
power wheels car and a... - Uh-huh.

227
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,982
- ...nintendo three-d-s.
- Yeah.

228
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:07,253
And a hello kitty
backpack...

229
00:11:07,254 --> 00:11:09,489
Merry Christmas.
There you go.

230
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,288
But I wasn't finished.

231
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:13,525
I'll read this on the way back
to the north pole.

232
00:11:13,526 --> 00:11:15,576
Okay?
There you go.

233
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:19,629
Whose idea was it to get Jimmy
to do this thing?

234
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,630
Okay.

235
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:22,765
Who's next, huh?

236
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,316
Ha ha.
This little girl.

237
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,938
What's your name, sweetie?

238
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:28,939
Kristen.

239
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,291
Mommy?

240
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:32,339
Santa smells funny.

241
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,576
You think mommy wants to sit
on Santa's other knee?

242
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:36,210
I think mommy's
a little too big.

243
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:38,879
Oh, Santa can make lotsa room
on here.

244
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,160
That's my wife, Jimmy.

245
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,087
Frank.
It's Christmas.

246
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:46,169
Gimme a call...

247
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:48,888
If you wanna break
the Irish curse.

248
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:51,539
I'm skinny, but I'm long.

249
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:55,215
Okay...Let's see

250
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:59,429
what Santa brought you
this year, kristie.

251
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,430
Aah!

252
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:02,567
Shit!

253
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:04,052
Ah, fuck!

254
00:12:04,362 --> 00:12:05,682
Fucking kids!

255
00:12:05,784 --> 00:12:07,100
Jesus Christ!

256
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,788
- Where is he going?
- Santa'll be right back, kids.

257
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:10,407
I didn't get to read
my list.

258
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:12,608
- Get in there!
- Oh. Oh.

259
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:14,610
Jesus, guy, come on.
It's Christmas.

260
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:17,341
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, god.

261
00:12:17,647 --> 00:12:18,647
Hey, pat.

262
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:23,218
When you get done in there,
get him a meal...

263
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:24,418
And some water.

264
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:27,379
Come on, pat,
gimme a drink.

265
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:55,479
You remember what that's from,
don't you?

266
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,815
Hm? Must have been, what,
the summer of '71?

267
00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:00,316
Point pleasant.

268
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:03,419
'70.
We enlisted that fall.

269
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,652
That's right.

270
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:07,523
I was in that bed
with Jenny Blake.

271
00:13:07,524 --> 00:13:09,290
You were in this one with,

272
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,592
uh...Uh, you know,
what was that redhead's name?

273
00:13:11,593 --> 00:13:14,133
- Maureen Galvin.
- Yeah.

274
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:15,897
All of a sudden,
from downstairs,

275
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:17,229
my father's voice booms out:

276
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,499
"Who the hell's
been drinking my scotch?"

277
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,235
And Jenny, she jumped off me
so fast- bam!

278
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:22,936
She smacked her head
right on that thing,

279
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:24,937
knocked herself out.

280
00:13:29,774 --> 00:13:31,576
You get enough to eat?

281
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,717
Yeah, yeah.

282
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:35,013
Got plenty left over,
you wanna take some home.

283
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,524
No.
I'm fine.

284
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:40,471
Rosie mad at me?

285
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:43,362
She'll get over it.

286
00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:46,674
Gimme a cigarette,
will ya?

287
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:51,069
She'll think the smell's
coming from you.

288
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:02,866
You wanna tell me
what's goin' on?

289
00:14:04,638 --> 00:14:06,188
Come on, Jimmy.

290
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,719
You look like
a goddamn castaway.

291
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:17,965
I can't sleep no more,
Shawn.

292
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:23,388
I keep seeing their faces
in my dreams.

293
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:24,619
Whose faces?

294
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:25,981
All of 'em.

295
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:27,489
Terry Burke.

296
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:29,291
Vince amato.

297
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:31,409
Ernie Hayes.

298
00:14:32,228 --> 00:14:35,228
It was different then,
Jimmy.

299
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:40,236
We did what we did
because we had to.

300
00:14:40,237 --> 00:14:41,377
Billy, too.

301
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:45,258
I see Billy a lot.

302
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:55,576
I got no one left in my life
because of the things I done.

303
00:14:56,382 --> 00:14:58,702
I chased everyone away.

304
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,910
Look at me.

305
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:07,679
What do I always tell you?

306
00:15:09,694 --> 00:15:11,834
Wherever we're going,

307
00:15:12,164 --> 00:15:14,624
when we cross that line,

308
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,773
we're going together.

309
00:15:18,902 --> 00:15:20,092
Me and you.

310
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Hm?

311
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,342
Yeah.

312
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:06,977
Uh, excuse me, buddy, where
the hell are you taking us?

313
00:16:06,978 --> 00:16:09,546
There's, uh, construction
on the Manhattan bridge.

314
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:10,979
Traffic's a mess over there,

315
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,715
so I'm tryin' to save you
a little time.

316
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:16,269
Or make yourself
a little more money, huh?

317
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:20,730
Trust me, okay?
I lived here my whole life.

318
00:16:32,298 --> 00:16:35,667
Just one hour away
from another chapter

319
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:37,268
in a historic rivalry

320
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:39,271
that is the New Jersey devils
and the New York rangers

321
00:16:39,272 --> 00:16:41,240
at Madison square garden
in New York.

322
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:42,872
It is a crucial game

323
00:16:42,873 --> 00:16:45,910
in the eastern conference
standings for both teams.

324
00:16:45,911 --> 00:16:47,511
Look who it is.

325
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:49,464
You wanna join us?

326
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:50,479
I'm expecting someone.

327
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,050
Bullshit, Jimmy.
You don't got any friends.

328
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:55,150
Detective torres,
meet Jimmy conlon.

329
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:57,320
Jimmy and I spent a lot
of quality time together

330
00:16:57,321 --> 00:16:59,455
back when he was killing people
for Shawn Maguire.

331
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:01,021
Nice to meet you, Jimmy.

332
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:03,024
We had a name for him
on homicide task force.

333
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:05,205
Jimmy the gravedigger.

334
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:07,896
What happened
to the other guy?

335
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:09,929
- That ginzo?
- Tornetta.

336
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,031
- Yeah. The ginzo.
- He retired.

337
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,000
I guess he got tired of workin'
with a d.A.

338
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:15,434
On Maguire's payroll.

339
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,502
Tired of watching murderers
like you walk free.

340
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,339
Maybe you should have taken
a bite outta that pie, Harding.

341
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,440
You still wouldn't be wearing
suits like that.

342
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,676
Oh, you're breaking my heart.
You don't like my suits.

343
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,047
What's the number, Jim?

344
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,380
What's the number?

345
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:32,147
Tornetta had you
at sixteen.

346
00:17:32,148 --> 00:17:34,115
I always thought it was more.
I made a list once.

347
00:17:34,116 --> 00:17:36,620
- All the names.
- How'd that work out?

348
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:37,621
Seventeen.

349
00:17:38,221 --> 00:17:42,225
You see, tornetta,
he didn't have Ernest Hayes.

350
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:44,186
But that was yours.

351
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,660
Doesn't ring a bell.
Sorry.

352
00:17:46,661 --> 00:17:50,499
I get a letter from his widow,
every year, handwritten,

353
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,198
asking me if I got
any new information.

354
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:56,971
25 years later,
she's still lookin' for closure.

355
00:17:56,972 --> 00:17:58,739
I got stacks
of those letters...

356
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,238
Crowdin' my fuckin' desk.

357
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:03,609
That get
under your skin at all?

358
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:10,850
Why don't you
whisper it to me.

359
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:12,718
What's the number, Jim?

360
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:14,589
What's the number?

361
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:24,995
Tell your partner they don't
serve chimichangas in here.

362
00:18:24,996 --> 00:18:27,097
You know
when the nightmares...

363
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:28,396
When they get so bad

364
00:18:28,397 --> 00:18:30,700
you can't look at yourself
in the mirror no more,

365
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:32,711
you give me a call.

366
00:18:35,203 --> 00:18:38,772
Let's go.
Suddenly I lost my appetite.

367
00:18:38,773 --> 00:18:40,642
Getting set to go here
in Madison square garden,

368
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:42,776
and we are now
less than an hour to go

369
00:18:42,777 --> 00:18:44,917
until the puck drops.

370
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:47,916
Get the door.

371
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:52,917
Hey, guy.

372
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,754
Hey, there the boys are!

373
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:56,755
Hey, hey.

374
00:18:57,055 --> 00:18:58,489
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa. Whoa.

375
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,558
Whoa, be gentle, now.
Be gentle.

376
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,191
You're grabbing
the real weapon there, baby.

377
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:06,282
- Hey!
- Hey, Danny!

378
00:19:06,431 --> 00:19:07,431
My boy!

379
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:08,533
Whoa!

380
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,168
What do you think?
Nice apartment.

381
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:12,302
Come on in.
Sit down.

382
00:19:12,303 --> 00:19:13,533
So, Danny...

383
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:15,705
Huh?

384
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:17,571
Where's our money?

385
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:21,910
You're a businessman.
I like that about you.

386
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,546
All right.
You heard him.

387
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:26,417
Get him his money.

388
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:30,916
In New York City,

389
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:32,818
which means we're less
than twenty minutes to go

390
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:34,752
till the opening face-off
between the New York rangers...

391
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:37,253
Jesus Christ.
Hey, legs!

392
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:41,442
Come here.

393
00:19:41,693 --> 00:19:43,528
The atmosphere
could not be more electric.

394
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:45,230
What'd I tell you about riding
around these streets alone?

395
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:46,765
I don't gotta answer
your questions.

396
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:48,064
You're not my dad, Mike.

397
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:49,101
Oh, so that's how it is
between us now.

398
00:19:49,102 --> 00:19:50,834
Yeah.
That's how it is.

399
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:54,025
Your mom know
you're out here?

400
00:19:55,073 --> 00:19:56,772
What if I called her?

401
00:19:56,773 --> 00:19:59,709
Let her know you're out here
on your own? Mm-hm.

402
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:03,613
Oh! We have some serious weapons
here, huh?

403
00:20:03,614 --> 00:20:07,074
Oh! That's loaded!
That's loaded!

404
00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:10,551
Look. I'll go home
if you give me a ride.

405
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:12,387
I can't give you a ride.
I'm with a client right now.

406
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:14,306
Come on, Mike.
Just let me sit inside.

407
00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:16,516
I ain't never been
in a limo before.

408
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:18,692
Look. I won't break anything.
I promise.

409
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:19,743
All right.

410
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:23,395
- If I let you inside, you'll
go home straight after? - Yes!

411
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:25,064
- You go home straight after?
- Promise. Straight after.

412
00:20:25,065 --> 00:20:26,115
All right.

413
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:28,441
Caught him.

414
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:30,503
Ohh.

415
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,060
It's all there.
Count it.

416
00:20:42,345 --> 00:20:43,345
Boh!

417
00:20:43,914 --> 00:20:45,648
Do you find this funny,
Danny?

418
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:47,934
Think about what you can do
with all that money!

419
00:20:47,935 --> 00:20:52,920
You can put up a luxury
high-rise on park place.

420
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:55,156
...so excited at what
they can do in the playoffs...

Shit.

00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,750
I found this in his jacket.

00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:32,819
What do we do?

455
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:38,370
Move! Yo, I think you
should call your dad.

456
00:24:47,923 --> 00:24:51,793
...live and we are ready for
the opening face-off center ice

457
00:24:51,794 --> 00:24:54,228
at Madison square garden
in New York.

458
00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:56,998
Off the face, New Jersey
in control, henrique.

459
00:24:56,999 --> 00:24:59,232
Henrique gives it
to jaromir jágr,

460
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:01,936
and he gets the puck all the
way down near the goal line.

461
00:25:01,937 --> 00:25:05,505
Sends it in front and it's
cleared out by lundqvist.

462
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:08,141
Nash on the wing,
dumps it into the corner.

463
00:25:08,142 --> 00:25:09,282
Hey, Shawn.

464
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,277
Listen, uh,
sorry again about-

465
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,081
now it's zuccarello,
swooping in to get the puck.

466
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:16,082
What?

467
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:18,684
Michael?

468
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,160
My Michael?

469
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:26,117
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

470
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:15,931
Gabby?

471
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,700
Gabby? Catelyn?

472
00:26:20,804 --> 00:26:21,804
Lily?

473
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:28,242
Tell Danny to stay put
until I hear from Jimmy.

474
00:26:28,243 --> 00:26:29,909
What about the Albanians?

475
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,012
It won't be long
before they realize

476
00:26:32,013 --> 00:26:33,379
grezda's not around.

477
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,930
They'll come after Danny.

478
00:26:36,849 --> 00:26:38,783
What are you
thinking about?

479
00:26:38,784 --> 00:26:42,424
The exact moment
my son went wrong.

480
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:48,459
Hello?

481
00:26:48,593 --> 00:26:49,826
Hey, Ricky.
It's me.

482
00:26:49,827 --> 00:26:51,496
Put-put-put Gabby
on the phone.

483
00:26:51,497 --> 00:26:52,531
Okay.
Hold on a second.

484
00:26:52,532 --> 00:26:53,532
Michael?

485
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:55,229
Hey. Listen.

486
00:26:55,432 --> 00:26:58,300
I need you and the girls to stay at
Ricky's until I call you back, okay?

487
00:26:58,301 --> 00:26:59,770
- What? Why do we have to stay here?
- Gabby?

488
00:26:59,771 --> 00:27:01,636
No! Tell me what's going on, Michael!

489
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,223
- Gabby? Goddamn it!
- Why are you yelling at me?

490
00:27:03,224 --> 00:27:04,739
Wa-uh-I don't wanna yell,

491
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,942
but it's the only way
I can get through to you!

492
00:27:05,943 --> 00:27:06,943
Hello?

493
00:27:46,607 --> 00:27:49,078
- Can I come in?
- What are you doing here?

494
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,880
I got a call from Shawn.

495
00:27:50,881 --> 00:27:52,398
You talk
to the police yet?

496
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,847
Talk to the police
about what?

497
00:27:53,848 --> 00:27:55,382
We both know why I'm here,
Michael.

498
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:57,786
Now, let's figure this out
so no one else gets hurt.

499
00:27:57,787 --> 00:28:00,088
You stay out of my house,
you understand me?

500
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:02,823
What are you gonna do
with that thing?

501
00:28:02,824 --> 00:28:03,824
Huh?

502
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:18,369
So, what, they sent you
to keep me quiet?

503
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:21,440
Shawn would, uh...Well,
he'd appreciate your support.

504
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:24,476
You mean he'd appreciate me
keeping my mouth shut.

505
00:28:24,477 --> 00:28:25,477
Yeah.

506
00:28:25,576 --> 00:28:27,036
Who were they?

507
00:28:27,095 --> 00:28:28,515
I don't know.

508
00:28:28,545 --> 00:28:32,783
Whatever Danny did,
I'm sure he had a reason for it.

509
00:28:32,784 --> 00:28:34,549
You always had a reason?

510
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:38,188
Or were you just...
Following marchin' orders?

511
00:28:38,189 --> 00:28:41,089
Let's just get through
the night, huh?

512
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:46,690
After that, you can go back
to hating me all you want.

513
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:49,729
Yeah.

514
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,696
Yeah, I get it.

515
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:54,635
I get it! All right.
Yeah.

516
00:28:54,636 --> 00:28:57,326
No, I'm not goin' nowhere.

517
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,360
Oh, that's the house here.

518
00:29:02,092 --> 00:29:04,822
342856th drive.
That's it.

519
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,049
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

520
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,986
I mean, your old man told us
to stay put.

521
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,604
He wants me
to clean up my mess.

522
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:18,153
That's exactly what
I'm gonna do.

523
00:29:18,154 --> 00:29:20,657
Well, I think we should wait
for Jimmy to get here.

524
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:24,208
Maybe you shouldn't think
so much.

525
00:29:24,493 --> 00:29:27,413
You don't smoke in my house.

526
00:29:32,566 --> 00:29:34,701
The place looks nice.

527
00:29:34,702 --> 00:29:36,671
I haven't been here since-

528
00:29:36,672 --> 00:29:38,722
since mom's funeral.

529
00:29:39,939 --> 00:29:41,574
It was nice of you
to show up.

530
00:29:41,575 --> 00:29:45,215
Well, I heard there was
free booze.

531
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,700
It's funny to you.

532
00:29:50,183 --> 00:29:52,053
Just trying to be-

533
00:29:52,552 --> 00:29:53,552
yeah.

534
00:29:56,855 --> 00:29:59,123
Five years
and it takes Shawn Maguire

535
00:29:59,124 --> 00:30:00,156
for you to come see me.

536
00:30:00,157 --> 00:30:01,492
You never wanted me
to come see you.

537
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:03,633
Because you're trash.

538
00:30:03,961 --> 00:30:06,813
And I don't want trash
around my family.

539
00:30:06,814 --> 00:30:09,632
They shoulda locked you up
a long time ago.

540
00:30:09,633 --> 00:30:11,451
Made you pay
for the things you did.

541
00:30:11,452 --> 00:30:13,200
Just because
I'm not behind bars

542
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:18,621
doesn't mean I'm not paying
for what I did, Michael.

543
00:30:40,692 --> 00:30:42,832
So, what happens now?

544
00:30:42,927 --> 00:30:46,047
I'll go see Shawn.
Let him know we talked.

545
00:30:46,048 --> 00:30:49,098
I'm sure he'll wanna show
his appreciation.

546
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:52,570
A little money he could set
aside for the girls.

547
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:53,834
Catelyn and Lily.

548
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:56,671
- What's that?
- My daughters' names.

549
00:30:56,672 --> 00:30:59,775
Catelyn grace conlon
and Lily Margaret conlon.

550
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:02,844
I know what their names are.
Do they know mine?

551
00:31:02,845 --> 00:31:04,679
They don't got a reason
to know yours.

552
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,547
You're not a part
of their lives.

553
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:11,558
It's bad enough
you were part of mine.

554
00:31:14,954 --> 00:31:16,056
Goodbye, Michael.

555
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:17,557
Goodbye, Jimmy.

556
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:12,719
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

557
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,860
Call an ambulance.

558
00:32:22,546 --> 00:32:24,345
What are you just
standing there for?

559
00:32:24,346 --> 00:32:29,206
- Call an ambulance!
- You're wasting your time.

560
00:32:47,702 --> 00:32:48,702
Hello.

561
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:50,502
Yeah.

562
00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:52,559
It's-it's me.

563
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:56,539
How'd it go with Michael?

564
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:58,242
Hello?

565
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,984
I just killed your boy,
Shawn.

566
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,599
I just killed Danny.

567
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:08,063
I had to.

568
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,150
He was gonna shoot Michael.

569
00:33:24,365 --> 00:33:26,301
Are you sure he's dead?

570
00:33:26,302 --> 00:33:27,902
Yeah. I'm sure.

571
00:33:30,971 --> 00:33:32,751
Who is it, honey?

572
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:39,142
You know how
this has to end.

573
00:33:40,481 --> 00:33:41,851
Yeah, I know.

574
00:33:43,518 --> 00:33:45,248
For Michael, too.

575
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Yeah.

576
00:33:53,457 --> 00:33:54,597
Hey, Shawn.

577
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
Hm?

578
00:33:56,026 --> 00:33:58,166
Wherever we're going,

579
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:01,668
when we cross that line...

580
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:04,673
We're going together.

581
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:05,769
Right?

582
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:27,011
What are you doing?

583
00:34:27,287 --> 00:34:28,404
I'm calling the cops.

584
00:34:28,405 --> 00:34:29,488
You don't wanna do that.

585
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:30,489
Trust me.

586
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:36,458
Get out of my house.

587
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:42,159
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!

588
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,100
Get out!

589
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,716
911, what's your emergency?

590
00:35:00,717 --> 00:35:02,416
This is Michael conlon.

591
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:03,917
342856th drive.

592
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:08,275
A- a man's been...
Shot and killed here.

593
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,521
In self-defense.

594
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:12,659
Did you shoot the victim?

595
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,660
No.

596
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:17,021
My father did.

597
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:23,701
Oh, no.

598
00:35:42,651 --> 00:35:45,019
Report of a shooting
at 342856th drive.

All area units respond.

Come on in.

00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:00,633
I- I don't know
where to start, uh...

604
00:36:00,634 --> 00:36:02,167
I work as a limousine driver,

605
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:04,704
and, uh, earlier today
I picked up a reservation.

606
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:07,171
Uh, two gentlemen
at the gramercy park hotel.

607
00:36:07,172 --> 00:36:10,643
And, uh...And th-the-they wanted
me to take them to ridgewood.

608
00:36:10,644 --> 00:36:12,542
Lift your arms for me,
please.

609
00:36:12,543 --> 00:36:14,511
Lace your fingers together
behind your head.

610
00:36:14,512 --> 00:36:16,512
Turn around, please.

611
00:36:16,648 --> 00:36:17,648
Yes, sir.

612
00:36:18,382 --> 00:36:20,517
What the he-?
What the hell?

613
00:36:20,518 --> 00:36:22,584
- I'm trying to explain to you.
- You feel that?

614
00:36:22,585 --> 00:36:26,356
Say another word and I'll blow
your fuckin' teeth out your ear.

615
00:36:26,357 --> 00:36:30,126
Officer, I'm tryin'
to fuckin' explain to you.

616
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:31,961
I'm not-I'm not

617
00:36:31,962 --> 00:36:33,727
I'm...I'm trying to explain
to you.

618
00:36:33,728 --> 00:36:35,593

Ten-four,

00:37:03,184 --> 00:37:05,589
All right. Let 'em know there's a
deceased white male in the kitchen.

625
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,856
Neighbors saw an armed suspect

626
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,592
flee the building
just before we arrived.

627
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,244
Wait, what the hell
are you talkin' about?

628
00:37:10,245 --> 00:37:11,896
- White male, black sweatpants, black
hoodie. - What the hell you doin', man?

00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,697
- I'm in the car! - Officer colston and
I have secured the perimeter.

632
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:17,966
We're gonna take a drive around
to see if we can locate him.

633
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:19,251
Hey!

Hey, that's frank.

He wants us to follow him.

639
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:37,282
Get outta here!

640
00:39:32,214 --> 00:39:35,534
Watch out! Watch out!
Watch out!

641
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,870
He's still comin'.

642
00:40:19,988 --> 00:40:20,988
Shit!

643
00:40:47,379 --> 00:40:52,115
He's comin' back.
This fuckin' guy won't quit.

644
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,751
Watch it! Watch it!
Watch it!

645
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,802
Whoa-whoa whoa-whoa!

646
00:41:07,563 --> 00:41:10,613
Get back! Get back!
Get back!

647
00:41:15,804 --> 00:41:16,804
Mike.

648
00:41:17,923 --> 00:41:18,923
Mike!

649
00:41:19,534 --> 00:41:20,534
My god.

650
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,920
Cover your face!

651
00:41:33,418 --> 00:41:35,378
Give me your hands.

652
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:41,859
- You okay?
- No! I'm not okay.

653
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,050
Come on!
Let's move!

654
00:41:53,035 --> 00:41:54,035
Come on.

655
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,970
don't do it, son!

656
00:42:06,012 --> 00:42:08,472
Come on.
We gotta move.

657
00:42:15,821 --> 00:42:16,821
Come on!

658
00:42:22,026 --> 00:42:23,576
What the fuck?!

659
00:42:23,663 --> 00:42:24,663
Hey!

660
00:42:24,762 --> 00:42:26,030
Protect yourself.

661
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:27,351
Hey, asshole!

662
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,500
Slow down.

663
00:42:31,469 --> 00:42:35,249
Come on, let's go!
Move, move, move!

664
00:42:44,012 --> 00:42:46,779
You owe me $2.50,
dickhead.

665
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,648
- Back off, pal. - I'm not gonna
back off! You stole my fare.

666
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,419
I'm not gonna say it again.

667
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,986
- Are you kidding?!
- Get lost!

668
00:42:53,987 --> 00:42:55,254
I'm not gonna get lost.

669
00:42:55,255 --> 00:42:56,790
You should at least apologize
or somethin'.

670
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:58,192
Look,
I'll give ya the money.

671
00:42:58,193 --> 00:43:00,060
Whoa-whoa! Whoa!
Take it easy, man.

672
00:43:00,061 --> 00:43:01,381
Jesus Christ.

673
00:43:01,394 --> 00:43:04,904
Forget about it.
It's just $2.50.

674
00:44:07,984 --> 00:44:09,124
Hey, frank.

675
00:44:10,453 --> 00:44:12,988
Your wife
called me earlier.

676
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:14,822
Yeah?
What'd she say?

677
00:44:14,823 --> 00:44:16,589
She wants to take me up
on my offer.

678
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:19,177
- Is that right?
- And I gotta tell ya.

679
00:44:19,178 --> 00:44:21,598
I've never seen a woman

680
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:25,662
swallow twelve inches
the way she does.

681
00:44:58,627 --> 00:45:00,717
South entrance clear.

682
00:45:34,124 --> 00:45:36,192
Ladies and gentlemen,

683
00:45:36,193 --> 00:45:41,797
we are being held momentarily
by train traffic ahead of us.

684
00:45:41,798 --> 00:45:45,978
Stand clear of
the closing doors, please.

685
00:45:50,006 --> 00:45:51,006
Jimmy.

686
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,220
Maria.

687
00:46:09,154 --> 00:46:10,422
Rose is asleep.

688
00:46:10,423 --> 00:46:13,793
don't wake her
till the mornin'.

689
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:17,296
Load the bodies from Danny's
into Michael's limousine.

690
00:46:17,297 --> 00:46:19,615
Dump the car where the cops
can find it.

691
00:46:19,616 --> 00:46:23,566
Make sure everything points
to Michael.

692
00:46:29,672 --> 00:46:31,172
I know.
It's my fault.

693
00:46:31,173 --> 00:46:34,110
Every shitty little thing in
your life is my fault, right?

694
00:46:34,111 --> 00:46:35,311
I'm turning myself in.

695
00:46:35,312 --> 00:46:36,443
Not yet, you're not.

696
00:46:36,444 --> 00:46:38,111
Shawn's gonna come after you,
Michael.

697
00:46:38,112 --> 00:46:41,849
And if he can't get to you,
he's gonna go after your family.

698
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,952
Right now you've gotta worry
about staying alive.

699
00:46:43,953 --> 00:46:46,321
And I'm the best chance
you've got.

700
00:46:46,322 --> 00:46:47,587
I know how this works.

701
00:46:47,588 --> 00:46:49,154
I want people at his house.

702
00:46:49,155 --> 00:46:51,289
Right now, Shawn's got everyone
meeting at the Abbey.

703
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:54,261
And from there, they're gonna
start pulling your life apart.

704
00:46:54,262 --> 00:46:55,795
Friends, family,
coworkers.

705
00:46:55,796 --> 00:46:56,796
Go!

706
00:46:56,895 --> 00:47:00,625
Anyone that can connect them
to you.

707
00:47:08,506 --> 00:47:09,738
And the cops?

708
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:12,084
They've got their own
motivation.

709
00:47:12,085 --> 00:47:14,361
You know what they do
to cop killers?

710
00:47:14,362 --> 00:47:19,242
They don't like to leave it
in a jury's hands.

711
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,239
Hey, Paul. Yeah.

712
00:47:21,585 --> 00:47:24,370
I got what you need.
Got it.

713
00:47:24,371 --> 00:47:27,281
Let's go.
Woodhaven, queens.

714
00:47:27,938 --> 00:47:29,840
There's gotta be
a few good cops.

715
00:47:29,841 --> 00:47:31,039
Someone'll listen.

716
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,441
The good cops won't listen

717
00:47:32,442 --> 00:47:33,774
to you 'cause you're my son.

718
00:47:33,775 --> 00:47:36,145
25 years, I've been
chasing this son of a bitch.

719
00:47:36,146 --> 00:47:37,311
This has gotta end tonight.

720
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,380
And those two bodies
from Danny's place,

721
00:47:39,381 --> 00:47:41,415
Shawn will make sure
they point back to you.

722
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:43,081
This is fourteen-eighty two.

723
00:47:43,082 --> 00:47:44,782
We got a one-eight-seven
in the suspect vehicle.

724
00:47:44,783 --> 00:47:47,452
They just found two bodies
inside of Mike conlon's limousine.

725
00:47:47,453 --> 00:47:48,453
Albanians.

726
00:47:48,953 --> 00:47:50,720
Part of a gang that operates
out of Brooklyn.

727
00:47:50,721 --> 00:47:54,191
Right now, we're the most
wanted men in this city.

728
00:47:54,192 --> 00:47:56,422
Michael, listen to me.

729
00:47:56,859 --> 00:47:58,945
One night.
That's all I'm asking.

730
00:47:58,946 --> 00:48:00,962
Listen to your father
for one night.

731
00:48:00,963 --> 00:48:02,897
If I can't figure this out
by the morning,

732
00:48:02,898 --> 00:48:04,364
I'll walk myself
into the precinct

733
00:48:04,365 --> 00:48:07,200
and tell 'em I blew
those two officers away.

734
00:48:07,201 --> 00:48:10,002
One night. Then you never
have to see me again.

735
00:48:10,003 --> 00:48:11,053
One night.

736
00:48:20,676 --> 00:48:21,676
This way.

737
00:48:38,056 --> 00:48:39,923
- Gimme your lace.
- What?

738
00:48:39,924 --> 00:48:42,334
Your shoelace.
Come on.

739
00:48:47,496 --> 00:48:49,314
What're you doin'?

740
00:48:49,315 --> 00:48:51,158
Where's your family?

741
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:52,933
My brother-in law's.

742
00:48:52,934 --> 00:48:54,669
I want ya to drive there.

743
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,335
Make sure they're safe.

744
00:48:56,336 --> 00:48:59,936
don't move until you hear
from me.

745
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:02,672
Wow.

746
00:49:10,913 --> 00:49:12,614
Where're you gonna go?

747
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:18,265
I'm gonna talk to Shawn.
See if we can fix this thing.

748
00:49:20,786 --> 00:49:21,786
Hey.

749
00:49:22,121 --> 00:49:24,761
Stay off the main streets.

750
00:49:25,826 --> 00:49:26,826
Yeah?

751
00:49:43,103 --> 00:49:45,793
I'm so sorry, Mr. Maguire.

752
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:50,191
I'm so sorry
for all of this.

753
00:49:50,944 --> 00:49:53,224
He was my best friend.

754
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,580
I shoulda done something.

755
00:49:55,581 --> 00:49:56,771
Look at me.

756
00:49:58,481 --> 00:49:59,941
Did he suffer?

757
00:50:00,616 --> 00:50:02,516
- Danny?
- Did my boy suffer?

758
00:50:02,517 --> 00:50:07,207
He just kind of went down.
It was real quick.

759
00:50:08,723 --> 00:50:09,773
Thank you.

760
00:50:11,859 --> 00:50:15,011
It's okay. Come here.
It's okay.

761
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:18,432
Sorry,
I didn't want him to die.

762
00:50:37,511 --> 00:50:39,613
Did anybody see
who killed the cop?

763
00:50:39,614 --> 00:50:41,646
Witness couldn't identify
the shooter.

764
00:50:41,647 --> 00:50:45,450
Conlon and the son were both
seen pulling their weapons.

765
00:50:45,451 --> 00:50:47,718
They couldn't get to Michael.

766
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:48,719
I know.

767
00:50:49,071 --> 00:50:50,353
Jimmy called.

768
00:50:50,354 --> 00:50:54,584
He wants to meet
in the old neighborhood.

769
00:50:58,092 --> 00:50:59,792
You need to see this.

770
00:50:59,793 --> 00:51:02,195
A city-wide manhunt
is underway tonight

771
00:51:02,196 --> 00:51:03,928
as police search
for two suspects

772
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:06,899
identified as James conlon
and his son, Michael conlon,

773
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,485
who they say took the lives
of two police officers

774
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:12,037
during a deadly chase
on Jamaica Avenue earlier.

775
00:51:12,038 --> 00:51:13,669
We're also getting
reports tonight

776
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,222
the two could be linked
to a double homicide.

777
00:51:16,223 --> 00:51:19,133
Two bodies were discovered
inside a limousine

778
00:51:19,134 --> 00:51:22,010
believed to have been driven
by Michael conlon.

779
00:51:22,011 --> 00:51:23,042
What do you got?

780
00:51:23,043 --> 00:51:25,044
Just got off
with the dispatcher.

781
00:51:25,045 --> 00:51:27,715
Last contact she had
with the patrol car

782
00:51:27,716 --> 00:51:28,813
was at 342856th drive.

783
00:51:28,814 --> 00:51:31,850
Officers responded to a report
of a shooting

784
00:51:31,851 --> 00:51:33,284
at Michael conlon's house.

785
00:51:33,285 --> 00:51:34,553
Do you wanna guess
who the victim is?

786
00:51:34,554 --> 00:51:35,964
Danny Maguire.

787
00:51:36,153 --> 00:51:37,520
Michael conlon
told the officers

788
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:41,481
his father was the one
who killed him.

789
00:51:42,423 --> 00:51:44,159
- Harding.
- Evening, detective.

790
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,300
This is Jimmy conlon.

791
00:51:46,827 --> 00:51:48,061
You got some fuckin' nerve.

792
00:51:48,062 --> 00:51:51,031
You better be on a plane
to shangri-la.

793
00:51:51,032 --> 00:51:52,764
I tried.
Flight was full.

794
00:51:52,765 --> 00:51:54,300
I got fifteen witnesses that say
you ran a cop car

795
00:51:54,301 --> 00:51:55,699
off-a Jamaica Avenue

796
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,537
killin' an officer, while
your son killed his partner.

797
00:51:59,538 --> 00:52:02,105
I killed that cop.
Not Michael.

798
00:52:02,106 --> 00:52:03,106
Bullshit.

799
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,141
If your son's
anything like you,

800
00:52:05,142 --> 00:52:07,744
he was probably laughing
when he pulled the trigger.

801
00:52:07,745 --> 00:52:09,525
I need your help.

802
00:52:09,978 --> 00:52:12,580
I am the last person
on this earth

803
00:52:12,581 --> 00:52:14,883
that you should be
asking help from.

804
00:52:14,884 --> 00:52:18,304
You're the only cop
I can trust.

805
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:21,919
And what's in it for me?

806
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,057
I'll turn myself in,
confess to killing those cops,

807
00:52:26,058 --> 00:52:27,859
if you agree to help Michael.

808
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,591
I'll die in a prison cell.

809
00:52:29,592 --> 00:52:31,795
That's what
you always wanted...

810
00:52:31,796 --> 00:52:33,296
Right, Harding?

811
00:52:33,395 --> 00:52:35,331
You're gonna die in
a prison cell anyway, conlon.

812
00:52:35,332 --> 00:52:36,798
There's no way out
this time.

813
00:52:36,799 --> 00:52:38,916
And I'm pretty sure
that I can find a witness

814
00:52:38,917 --> 00:52:40,694
that says your boy did it.

815
00:52:40,695 --> 00:52:42,437
Tell me what you want.

816
00:52:42,438 --> 00:52:43,438
Names.

817
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:44,770
All of them.

818
00:52:44,771 --> 00:52:48,240
Every life you took.
Every family you ruined.

819
00:52:48,241 --> 00:52:50,140
If you give me that...

820
00:52:50,141 --> 00:52:54,778
Maybe, fuckin' maybe,
I'll listen to your son.

821
00:52:54,779 --> 00:52:55,779
Not yet.

822
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,381
I need to take care
of a few things.

823
00:52:58,382 --> 00:52:59,913
Turn yourself in.

824
00:52:59,914 --> 00:53:01,384
You drink coffee, Harding?

825
00:53:01,385 --> 00:53:02,385
Yeah.

826
00:53:02,417 --> 00:53:04,450
Six cups a day
for the last thirty years.

827
00:53:04,451 --> 00:53:10,281
Put in a little extra sugar.
It's gonna be a long night.

828
00:53:25,264 --> 00:53:27,470
- Gabby?
- What happened to your face?

829
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:29,135
- Where are the girls?
- They're asleep upstairs.

830
00:53:29,136 --> 00:53:30,738
Hurry up
and go pack their stuff.

831
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:32,370
Why do you have a gun?

832
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:34,508
Look, Michael, whatever you're
going through, there's a way out.

833
00:53:34,509 --> 00:53:36,740
- Mike. - Look, Michael,
we get- - sit down, Ricky.

834
00:53:36,741 --> 00:53:38,342
They said you killed two cops.

835
00:53:38,343 --> 00:53:41,212
It's all over the news.
Tell me you didn't do it.

836
00:53:41,213 --> 00:53:42,480
I picked up
two clients today,

837
00:53:42,481 --> 00:53:44,082
took 'em
to Danny Maguire's house.

838
00:53:44,083 --> 00:53:45,614
And he killed 'em,
he shot 'em both,

839
00:53:45,615 --> 00:53:47,883
and then he tried to kill me,
too, 'cause I saw him do it.

840
00:53:47,884 --> 00:53:49,684
- Did you call the cops?
- It's-it's not that simple.

841
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:51,120
What do you mean
it's not that simple?

842
00:53:51,121 --> 00:53:52,486
Look, I grew up around
this stuff.

843
00:53:52,487 --> 00:53:54,122
I know what these people
are capable of.

844
00:53:54,123 --> 00:53:57,242
And now they're
comin' after us.

845
00:53:57,243 --> 00:54:00,327
You gotta take the girls
and go.

846
00:54:00,328 --> 00:54:01,394
I'm calling the cops.

847
00:54:01,395 --> 00:54:03,715
Baby. Baby, baby. Baby.

848
00:54:04,395 --> 00:54:06,405
I'm gonna fix this.

849
00:54:07,783 --> 00:54:10,153
But you gotta trust me.

850
00:54:12,168 --> 00:54:13,168
Okay.

851
00:54:15,804 --> 00:54:17,536
- You gotta tell 'em you haven't seen
us. - Do I have to?

852
00:54:17,537 --> 00:54:21,497
They're not gonna
just go away, Ricky.

853
00:54:22,308 --> 00:54:24,538
Open the goddamn door!

854
00:54:26,245 --> 00:54:27,845
Can I help you?

855
00:54:31,215 --> 00:54:34,117
Okay. Come-come here, sweetie.
Come here.

856
00:54:34,118 --> 00:54:35,550
Where we going, daddy?

857
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:36,818
We're gonna play
hide-and-seek.

858
00:54:36,819 --> 00:54:40,279
Where do you think
you're goin'?!

859
00:54:41,255 --> 00:54:42,690
Be real quiet, okay?

860
00:54:42,691 --> 00:54:46,381
Uncle Ricky's gonna try
to find us.

861
00:54:54,865 --> 00:54:59,235
Can I help you find something
in my house?

862
00:55:04,172 --> 00:55:05,524
Who was here for dinner?

863
00:55:05,525 --> 00:55:07,845
Just some work friends.

864
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:11,378
You always serve your friends
chicken nuggets?

865
00:55:11,379 --> 00:55:13,299
We're on a budget.

866
00:55:16,215 --> 00:55:18,265
Where's your friend?

867
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,903
I know your sister called.

868
00:55:22,904 --> 00:55:25,634
What are you,
stalking me?

869
00:55:31,158 --> 00:55:35,838
- What did she want?
- She was cooking dinner.

870
00:55:39,265 --> 00:55:41,995
She...Asked about a recipe.

871
00:55:53,008 --> 00:55:54,008
A recipe?

872
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,400
Chicken nuggets?

873
00:56:06,951 --> 00:56:09,141
I'm calling the cops.

874
00:56:10,854 --> 00:56:12,224
Call 'em now.

875
00:56:16,259 --> 00:56:17,259
Yeah?

876
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:19,759
Okay. I got it.

877
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,514
Tommy!
We gotta go!

878
00:56:31,871 --> 00:56:32,871
Be quiet.

879
00:56:33,673 --> 00:56:34,673
Shh!

880
00:56:43,978 --> 00:56:45,528
They just left.

881
00:56:45,947 --> 00:56:49,867
It doesn't count!
You have to tag me!

882
00:57:19,172 --> 00:57:20,172
Driver...

883
00:57:20,739 --> 00:57:23,969
Pull over.
Turn off the lights.

884
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:27,645
Anyone gives you shit,
your transmission blew

885
00:57:27,646 --> 00:57:31,016
and you're waitin'
for a backup.

886
00:57:39,586 --> 00:57:40,586
Hey.

887
00:57:41,555 --> 00:57:42,956
You want a drink?

888
00:57:42,957 --> 00:57:43,957
Nah.

889
00:57:44,556 --> 00:57:46,157
don't make me drink alone.

890
00:57:46,158 --> 00:57:48,359
Miss, get him a scotch,
will you?

891
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,730
On the rocks.

892
00:57:50,428 --> 00:57:51,827
So I heard you, uh,

893
00:57:51,828 --> 00:57:54,665
left frank face-down
in the subway.

894
00:57:54,666 --> 00:57:56,331
Frank was an asshole.

895
00:57:56,332 --> 00:57:57,800
Frank had fifteen years
and thirty pounds on ya.

896
00:57:57,801 --> 00:57:59,134
I thought he woulda
worn you down.

897
00:57:59,135 --> 00:58:00,145
So did I.

898
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:04,638
Gomez shoots...

899
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:05,779
Close game.

900
00:58:05,939 --> 00:58:07,672
Coming up
on two minutes to go...

901
00:58:07,673 --> 00:58:10,509
It's gotta be fifteen years
since I've been in here.

902
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:11,809
The place looks different.

903
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:14,179
All the old places
look different now.

904
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,479
Me, Richie Ryan,
Mickey featherstone

905
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,383
would meet every Saturday night
for drinks.

906
00:58:19,384 --> 00:58:21,649
Sit in that back booth,
back there.

907
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:25,621
Yeah, I used to bring Danny here
when he was a boy.

908
00:58:25,622 --> 00:58:26,986
Special occasions.

909
00:58:26,987 --> 00:58:30,624
His first communion,
I ordered him a lobster.

910
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:32,258
Waitress brings it out.

911
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,744
Big as this table.
Beautiful, too.

912
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:37,138
He takes a look at it,
and he says,

913
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:40,639
"do you have
any chicken fingers?"

914
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:44,333
Thanks.

915
00:58:45,401 --> 00:58:46,681
How's Rosie?

916
00:58:47,969 --> 00:58:49,937
Hell of a thing to know

917
00:58:49,938 --> 00:58:55,578
you're never gonna make the
woman you love happy again.

918
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,539
I'm here asking
for my son's life, Shawn.

919
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:17,090
I pulled the trigger.
I killed Danny.

920
00:59:17,091 --> 00:59:20,026
You wanna send someone for me,
tell me when.

921
00:59:20,027 --> 00:59:23,129
I'll keep the door open,
I'll put my gun on the table.

922
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:25,730
Michael, he's a good kid.

923
00:59:26,865 --> 00:59:29,601
He's got a family.
He don't deserve this.

924
00:59:29,602 --> 00:59:31,353
Michael was not gonna talk.

925
00:59:31,354 --> 00:59:32,796
If Danny hadn't shown up-

926
00:59:32,797 --> 00:59:34,169
you think I sent him there?

927
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,606
I told him to stay put.
He wouldn't listen.

928
00:59:36,607 --> 00:59:38,825
He was into some bad shit,
Shawn.

929
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:42,066
don't talk to me
about my son.

930
00:59:44,677 --> 00:59:48,014
I'm gonna do what I have to do
to protect Michael.

931
00:59:48,015 --> 00:59:51,051
If that means I gotta talk
to someone...

932
00:59:51,052 --> 00:59:52,692
Talk to someone?

933
00:59:52,804 --> 00:59:54,329
Cops. John Harding.

934
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:55,785
The things I know.

935
00:59:55,786 --> 00:59:58,587
Things that mattered
twenty years ago?

936
00:59:58,588 --> 01:00:00,357
What, you think the feds
are parked outside,

937
01:00:00,358 --> 01:00:01,992
listenin'
to this conversation?

938
01:00:01,993 --> 01:00:03,557
Huh?
Take a look out there.

939
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:07,028
Nobody gives a shit
about what you know anymore.

940
01:00:07,029 --> 01:00:08,928
Nobody gives a shit
about you.

941
01:00:08,929 --> 01:00:11,799
You die tomorrow, you'd rot away
alone in your bedroom

942
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,165
until the stench gets so bad

943
01:00:13,166 --> 01:00:15,868
the neighbors got no choice
but to call the cops.

944
01:00:15,869 --> 01:00:17,603
Wouldn't be any point
in having a funeral

945
01:00:17,604 --> 01:00:18,869
because no one would come.

946
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:20,739
He shoots!
Forty seconds to go.

947
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:21,937
Kick save by lundqvist.

948
01:00:21,938 --> 01:00:25,008
I'm the only one
ever cared about you.

949
01:00:25,009 --> 01:00:27,343
And all of that ended
an hour ago

950
01:00:27,344 --> 01:00:29,714
when you killed my son.

951
01:00:32,813 --> 01:00:35,917
I'm comin' after your boy
with everything I got.

952
01:00:35,918 --> 01:00:37,651
I won't let you take him,
Shawn.

953
01:00:37,652 --> 01:00:39,051
You got no choice.

954
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:42,152
And when it's done,
and it will be done,

955
01:00:42,153 --> 01:00:44,773
you and I are gonna meet
back here at this restaurant,

956
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:47,359
at this same table that I used
to share with my boy,

957
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,924
and I'm gonna look you
in the eyes,

958
01:00:48,925 --> 01:00:51,462
just like you're looking me
in the eyes right now,

959
01:00:51,463 --> 01:00:55,293
and I'm gonna see
how empty they are

960
01:00:55,365 --> 01:00:58,505
without your son
in the world.

961
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:01,919
Same thing I saw
in my wife's eyes.

962
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,205
Same thing you're seein'
in my eyes.

963
01:01:05,206 --> 01:01:07,486
And when I see that...

964
01:01:07,858 --> 01:01:10,188
Then I'll let you die.

965
01:01:10,219 --> 01:01:12,219
...shoots just wide.

966
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:13,978
Lundqvist couldn't get
his stick on it.

967
01:01:13,979 --> 01:01:16,213
And it just missed.
Two, one...

968
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,414
And it is over at the garden.

969
01:01:18,415 --> 01:01:20,835
The rangers win it 3-2.

970
01:01:21,468 --> 01:01:23,608
Thanks for the drink.

971
01:01:24,451 --> 01:01:27,354
What a night for the rangers
here at Madison square garden.

972
01:01:27,355 --> 01:01:30,725
Where do you think
you're going?

973
01:01:51,171 --> 01:01:52,401
Devils suck!

974
01:01:52,705 --> 01:01:54,575
Go back to Jersey!

975
01:02:05,882 --> 01:02:07,381
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy.

976
01:02:07,382 --> 01:02:09,151
I left my wallet in my seat.
I'm leaving town tomorrow.

977
01:02:09,152 --> 01:02:11,551
- I'm screwed without it. Please.
- All right.

978
01:02:11,552 --> 01:02:12,687
Take this guy down
to his seat.

979
01:02:12,688 --> 01:02:13,787
- Thanks, pal.
- All right.

980
01:02:13,788 --> 01:02:15,887
Whoa, easy, fellas. Game's
over. No re-entry. Sorry.

981
01:02:15,888 --> 01:02:16,888
Go back to Jersey!

982
01:02:16,889 --> 01:02:19,939
- Sir!
- I got it! Thank you!

983
01:02:22,561 --> 01:02:23,561
Hey, hey!

984
01:02:59,188 --> 01:03:01,755
- What'd he say?
- You need to get your family out.

985
01:03:01,756 --> 01:03:03,691
Remember the cabin I used
to bring you to

986
01:03:03,692 --> 01:03:05,558
when you were a boy?
Up by north-south shore?

987
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:08,393
- Take the throughway all the
way up to Haines falls. - Yeah.

988
01:03:08,394 --> 01:03:10,584
You'll be safe there.

989
01:03:10,597 --> 01:03:11,647
Stay here.

990
01:03:33,812 --> 01:03:37,182
Yeah,
that's, uh...That's Danny.

991
01:03:40,451 --> 01:03:41,961
That's my son.

992
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:51,971
Who's that man, daddy?

993
01:03:51,992 --> 01:03:56,322
It's nobody, honey.
Let's get in the car.

994
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,299
All right,
you know where you're going?

995
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,720
I'll find it.

996
01:04:02,901 --> 01:04:04,719
Hey, babe.
Look at me.

997
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,230
It's gonna be okay.
Go.

998
01:04:07,437 --> 01:04:08,989
What're you doing?

999
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:10,472
Get in the car.

1000
01:04:10,473 --> 01:04:12,075
If I run now,
I'll never stop running.

1001
01:04:12,076 --> 01:04:13,608
Michael.
You have to leave the city.

1002
01:04:13,609 --> 01:04:15,644
There's this kid I train
down at the boxing gym.

1003
01:04:15,645 --> 01:04:17,312
He was with me in the car
at Danny's house.

1004
01:04:17,313 --> 01:04:18,611
He saw everything.

1005
01:04:18,612 --> 01:04:20,415
Can you keep me alive
long enough to get to him?

1006
01:04:20,416 --> 01:04:21,606
I'll drive.

1007
01:04:35,124 --> 01:04:36,494
Get me price.

1008
01:04:40,195 --> 01:04:43,865
So you keep in touch with your
mom's side of the family?

1009
01:04:43,866 --> 01:04:46,600
What, you're the big
family supporter now?

1010
01:04:46,601 --> 01:04:48,133
Listen,
I came home a few times.

1011
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,735
Your mom and I tried
to work things out.

1012
01:04:49,736 --> 01:04:51,102
The only time
you ever came home

1013
01:04:51,103 --> 01:04:52,736
was when you needed a place
to lay low.

1014
01:04:52,737 --> 01:04:55,405
And I'd find a gun hidden
in every room in the house.

1015
01:04:55,406 --> 01:05:01,406
And I'd be scared to death that
you'd end up like cousin Billy.

1016
01:05:03,778 --> 01:05:05,238
This is price.

1017
01:05:05,914 --> 01:05:07,981
I got a job for you.

1018
01:05:07,982 --> 01:05:10,284
Two people.
I'll double your quote.

1019
01:05:10,285 --> 01:05:12,552
But it's gotta be done
by the morning.

1020
01:05:12,553 --> 01:05:13,819
They killed two cops

1021
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:15,955
and a couple of squarehead
gangsters in queens.

1022
01:05:15,956 --> 01:05:18,190
The whole city's
huntin' 'em down.

1023
01:05:18,191 --> 01:05:20,391
I need you
to get there first.

1024
01:05:20,392 --> 01:05:22,560
And what are their names?

1025
01:05:22,561 --> 01:05:25,061
Michael and Jimmy conlon.

1026
01:05:25,927 --> 01:05:27,296
You're fuckin' with me,
right?

1027
01:05:27,297 --> 01:05:28,496
You want the job or not?

1028
01:05:28,497 --> 01:05:32,934
Conlon? I'll kill that
motherfucker for free.

1029
01:05:32,935 --> 01:05:36,485
Just make sure
his son dies first.

1030
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:42,041
Your next one,
is it a...A boy or a girl?

1031
01:05:42,042 --> 01:05:43,042
A boy.

1032
01:05:43,508 --> 01:05:46,378
Boy?
Got a name picked out?

1033
01:05:46,478 --> 01:05:47,478
Yeah.

1034
01:05:54,149 --> 01:05:57,450
You like what you do,
driving a limo around?

1035
01:05:57,451 --> 01:05:59,554
Sure. I do cartwheels on my way
out the door every night.

1036
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:01,015
That bad, huh?

1037
01:06:01,088 --> 01:06:03,056
Since when do you give a shit
if I'm happy?

1038
01:06:03,057 --> 01:06:04,389
This is for your own sake,
right?

1039
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:06,242
I say I'm happy,
that life turned out all right

1040
01:06:06,243 --> 01:06:08,060
and then you don't feel
so guilty about leaving.

1041
01:06:08,061 --> 01:06:10,127
- That's right.
- Yeah.

1042
01:06:10,128 --> 01:06:11,408
So, are you?

1043
01:06:11,728 --> 01:06:15,432
I'd be happier if I were
still fightin', but...

1044
01:06:15,433 --> 01:06:17,284
I used to watch your fights.

1045
01:06:17,285 --> 01:06:19,066
That's fuckin' bullshit.

1046
01:06:19,067 --> 01:06:22,037
Over on church street.
I'd stand in the tunnel.

1047
01:06:22,038 --> 01:06:24,339
I was there when you lost
to Ramirez.

1048
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:26,107
You didn't have
the killer instinct

1049
01:06:26,108 --> 01:06:27,841
to make a top-class fighter,
Mike.

1050
01:06:27,842 --> 01:06:29,125
I got fucked by the judges.

1051
01:06:29,126 --> 01:06:30,340
The judges didn't fuck you.

1052
01:06:30,341 --> 01:06:31,811
You were ahead at the end
of the fourth,

1053
01:06:31,812 --> 01:06:33,443
and you stopped
using your jab.

1054
01:06:33,444 --> 01:06:36,181
You could've made the rankings
if you'd-a used that jab more.

1055
01:06:36,182 --> 01:06:38,949
That's life.
It don't offer any do-overs.

1056
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:40,282
Believe me, I know.

1057
01:06:40,283 --> 01:06:42,051
Otherwise, I woulda put in
for one a long time ago.

1058
01:06:42,052 --> 01:06:44,250
You've got a lot of anger
in you.

1059
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:45,620
Wouldn't you?
With you as a father?

1060
01:06:45,621 --> 01:06:47,171
Because I left?

1061
01:06:47,388 --> 01:06:49,528
You got it backwards.

1062
01:06:49,689 --> 01:06:52,392
The things I did,
the things I seen...

1063
01:06:52,393 --> 01:06:54,158
It becomes who you are.

1064
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:56,526
You can't just go home
and scrub it off.

1065
01:06:56,527 --> 01:06:59,265
The only way I could protect you
was to walk away.

1066
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:01,331
Forget about you
and your mom.

1067
01:07:01,332 --> 01:07:07,332
I wanted a better life for you
than the one I chose for myself.

1068
01:07:07,368 --> 01:07:08,468
That's it.

1069
01:07:16,809 --> 01:07:18,769
I'm sorry, Michael.

1070
01:08:19,722 --> 01:08:25,592
Hey. You know this kid called
legs? You know where he lives?

1071
01:08:25,593 --> 01:08:27,093
Building three.

1072
01:08:27,162 --> 01:08:28,661
Which apartment?

1073
01:08:28,662 --> 01:08:30,330
What do I look like,
Google maps?

1074
01:08:30,331 --> 01:08:31,331
Thanks.

1075
01:08:33,466 --> 01:08:35,299
His name's Curtis banks.

1076
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:37,569
You know,
h- his mom works as a nurse.

1077
01:08:37,570 --> 01:08:38,620
No, sorry.

1078
01:08:41,704 --> 01:08:42,704
Yeah?

1079
01:08:42,772 --> 01:08:44,039
I'm lookin' for legs.

1080
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,310
Yeah. Me too.
Preferably spread.

1081
01:08:55,749 --> 01:08:56,749
Hello?

1082
01:09:04,154 --> 01:09:06,656
911.
What's your emergency?

1083
01:09:06,657 --> 01:09:09,125
Yes. The bad guys
that was on the TV?

1084
01:09:09,126 --> 01:09:10,928
They're outside the door.

1085
01:09:10,929 --> 01:09:12,889
Just hold the line.

1086
01:09:21,968 --> 01:09:24,101
All units respond
to a code one.

1087
01:09:24,102 --> 01:09:27,155
Positive I.D. On the
I-278 shooting suspects.

1088
01:09:27,156 --> 01:09:31,786
648 park Avenue, Marcy houses,
building three.

1089
01:09:35,678 --> 01:09:38,747
Hi. I'm-I'm lookin' for this kid
called Curtis banks?

1090
01:09:38,748 --> 01:09:39,748
Legs?

1091
01:09:47,821 --> 01:09:50,051
Open the door, please.

1092
01:09:52,124 --> 01:09:53,691
He not ready.
He not ready.

1093
01:09:53,692 --> 01:09:55,125
No, you not ready.

1094
01:09:55,126 --> 01:09:56,793
Terrell is gettin'
his ass beat.

1095
01:09:56,794 --> 01:09:57,926
Boy, you see!

1096
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:59,630
Yo, go get the door.

1097
01:09:59,631 --> 01:10:00,631
Hurry up.

1098
01:10:01,633 --> 01:10:02,633
Yeah?

1099
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:05,263
I'm lookin' for this kid
named legs, or Curtis.

1100
01:10:05,264 --> 01:10:06,935
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter who we are.

1101
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,434
Do you know him or not?

1102
01:10:08,435 --> 01:10:10,037
Sorry, but my mom told me not to
talk to creepy-ass old men.

1103
01:10:10,038 --> 01:10:12,303
Hey. You.
I seen you before.

1104
01:10:12,304 --> 01:10:14,274
Down at the boxing gym.
You know legs, right?

1105
01:10:14,275 --> 01:10:16,306
Yeah, that's my brother.
Is he okay?

1106
01:10:16,307 --> 01:10:18,243
I need to get ahold of him.
It's really important.

1107
01:10:18,244 --> 01:10:20,145
He's not answering his phone.
Where would he go?

1108
01:10:20,146 --> 01:10:21,196
I don't know.

1109
01:10:21,197 --> 01:10:22,427
Well, think.

1110
01:10:28,283 --> 01:10:29,618
I need you to tell
your brother...

1111
01:10:29,619 --> 01:10:32,169
That Mike needs his help.

1112
01:10:34,154 --> 01:10:35,422
It's really important.

1113
01:10:35,423 --> 01:10:36,473
All right.

1114
01:10:44,362 --> 01:10:45,372
Let's go!

1115
01:10:46,062 --> 01:10:47,530
We gotta get out of here.

1116
01:10:47,531 --> 01:10:50,634
It's a big building.
We've got some time.

1117
01:10:50,635 --> 01:10:51,825
Let's wait.

1118
01:11:15,818 --> 01:11:18,054
We're looking for a white male,
in his thirties...

1119
01:11:18,055 --> 01:11:19,285
Anybody in there?

1120
01:11:19,286 --> 01:11:20,789
Police.
Open the door, please.

1121
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:22,750
This is the police.

1122
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:25,942
Let's go.
Everybody out.

1123
01:11:25,943 --> 01:11:28,126
Come on, folks.
Let's go.

1124
01:11:28,127 --> 01:11:30,863
Police! We need to evacuate
the building.

1125
01:11:30,864 --> 01:11:32,274
Everybody out!

1126
01:11:32,964 --> 01:11:34,432
Come on.
Let's go, let's go.

1127
01:11:34,433 --> 01:11:37,033
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

1128
01:11:39,369 --> 01:11:41,005
Copy that. I'm covering
the southeast door-

1129
01:11:41,006 --> 01:11:42,503
sir!
You can't be back here.

1130
01:11:42,504 --> 01:11:44,626
You don't understand.
My mom lives in this building.

1131
01:11:44,627 --> 01:11:45,940
- I'm sorry.
- She's having chest pains.

1132
01:11:45,941 --> 01:11:48,977
There's two fugitives hiding inside.
I'm not allowed to let anyone in.

1133
01:11:48,978 --> 01:11:50,428
Could you check on her
for me?

1134
01:11:50,429 --> 01:11:51,810
What's her apartment number?

1135
01:11:51,811 --> 01:11:55,181
317.
I have the keys right here.

1136
01:12:02,052 --> 01:12:04,554
Two tactical units
are heading inside now.

1137
01:12:04,555 --> 01:12:06,555
And you're sure
conlon's in there?

1138
01:12:06,556 --> 01:12:08,557
Why do you think I saved you
a front-row seat?

1139
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:10,198
Police, open up!

1140
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:11,927
Police.

1141
01:12:12,393 --> 01:12:14,462
Open up the door!
It's the police!

1142
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:15,653
Go, go, go.

1143
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:19,670
Open up! Police!

1144
01:12:22,534 --> 01:12:23,534
Hey!

1145
01:12:29,473 --> 01:12:30,473
Shit.

1146
01:12:30,772 --> 01:12:32,157
What's goin' on?

1147
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:33,938
Now's our chance.

1148
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:36,833
Let's move.

1149
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,956
Fools are in there!
He's got a gun!

1150
01:12:51,957 --> 01:12:54,558
Yo, get back!
Get back! Move!

1151
01:12:54,559 --> 01:12:55,559
Freeze!

1152
01:13:00,661 --> 01:13:02,230
Targets are on
the twelfth floor,

1153
01:13:02,231 --> 01:13:03,765
headin' down
the west stairwell.

1154
01:13:03,766 --> 01:13:05,946
Repeat, twelfth floor.

1155
01:13:14,972 --> 01:13:18,212
Let's go!
Let's clear 'em out!

1156
01:13:23,378 --> 01:13:24,779
Shots fired
in the west stairwell.

1157
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,600
Two officers down!

1158
01:13:32,852 --> 01:13:33,902
Holy shit!

1159
01:13:40,224 --> 01:13:41,224
Attention.

1160
01:13:41,824 --> 01:13:44,593
An emergency has been
reported in this building.

1161
01:13:44,594 --> 01:13:48,631
Do not use elevators.
Please leave the building.

1162
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:53,402
We gotta get everybody
outta this building now!

1163
01:13:55,134 --> 01:13:57,364
This is some bullshit.

1164
01:13:57,971 --> 01:14:00,111
Stop pushing me, man.

1165
01:14:00,774 --> 01:14:01,774
Aw, shit.

1166
01:14:02,908 --> 01:14:04,958
Easy does it.
Okay.

1167
01:14:06,712 --> 01:14:07,712
Move!

1168
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:13,187
Do not use elevators.

1169
01:14:15,383 --> 01:14:17,713
Shit!
He's got a gun!

1170
01:14:19,285 --> 01:14:23,087
Please leave the building,
utilizing...

1171
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:25,268
...fire exit stairway.

1172
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:27,525
You ever wanna see your family
again, leave.

1173
01:14:27,526 --> 01:14:30,394
- Leave now. - Who was that?
- He's a professional killer.

1174
01:14:30,395 --> 01:14:32,196
He won't stop
until we're all dead.

1175
01:14:32,197 --> 01:14:34,215
...fire exit stairway.

1176
01:14:34,216 --> 01:14:36,126
An emergency has...

1177
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:37,865
- Go, Mike. Go!
- ...been reported in this building.

1178
01:14:37,866 --> 01:14:40,403
Please leave the building
utilizing the nearest...

1179
01:14:40,404 --> 01:14:41,836
- Price!
- ...exit or the fire exit.

1180
01:14:41,837 --> 01:14:43,202
Come on, you fucker!

1181
01:14:43,203 --> 01:14:45,572
Please do not use elevators.

1182
01:14:45,573 --> 01:14:47,713
Do not use elevators.

1183
01:14:47,909 --> 01:14:48,992
Come on, price!

1184
01:14:48,993 --> 01:14:50,453
You dumb fuck!

1185
01:15:02,517 --> 01:15:05,097
...elevators.
Attention...

1186
01:15:14,827 --> 01:15:16,426
Do not use elevators.

1187
01:15:16,427 --> 01:15:19,427
Repeat,
Do not use elevators.

1188
01:15:29,138 --> 01:15:32,958
Do not use elevators.
Repeat, Do not-

1189
01:16:39,254 --> 01:16:41,444
don't do it, Michael.

1190
01:16:43,258 --> 01:16:44,588
don't do it!

1191
01:16:47,027 --> 01:16:48,995
- don't fuckin' move!
- Let's go!

1192
01:16:48,996 --> 01:16:52,086
Police! Freeze!
On the ground!

1193
01:16:55,367 --> 01:16:58,327
All right, we're comin' down.

1194
01:17:01,938 --> 01:17:03,528
Conlon!
Conlon!

1195
01:17:04,358 --> 01:17:06,268
Stay there, conlon!

1196
01:17:10,745 --> 01:17:12,655
Goddamn it, conlon!

1197
01:17:15,582 --> 01:17:16,582
Conlon!

1198
01:17:22,253 --> 01:17:23,303
Stay back.

1199
01:17:24,256 --> 01:17:25,256
Conlon!

1200
01:17:25,858 --> 01:17:27,389
- Come on.
- Hey!

1201
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:28,800
Jesus, conlon.

1202
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:33,608
Come back up. Come on.
I'll give you a hand.

1203
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:39,899
They're inside
on the ground floor!

1204
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:42,200
I want them in custody.

1205
01:17:42,201 --> 01:17:43,341
Easy. Easy.

1206
01:17:46,538 --> 01:17:49,090
Get on the ground!
Put your hands up!

1207
01:17:49,091 --> 01:17:51,609
Suspects heading north
toward the rail yard.

1208
01:17:51,610 --> 01:17:53,143
We have the area surrounded!

1209
01:17:53,144 --> 01:17:54,194
Fuck!
Oh!

1210
01:18:00,048 --> 01:18:01,918
Get on the ground!

1211
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:05,352
Freeze!
Get down on the ground!

1212
01:18:05,353 --> 01:18:07,313
don't fuckin' move!

1213
01:18:07,772 --> 01:18:09,748
Hold it right there!

1214
01:18:09,749 --> 01:18:11,656
Eyes on the suspects.

1215
01:18:11,657 --> 01:18:14,477
Headed to the east quadrant!

1216
01:18:16,059 --> 01:18:17,519
I lost visual.

1217
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:20,363
Conlon, it's Harding.

1218
01:18:20,364 --> 01:18:23,104
It's over.
Do ya hear me?

1219
01:18:23,234 --> 01:18:25,234
You gotta surrender.

1220
01:18:31,837 --> 01:18:34,757
That's it.
We're comin' in.

1221
01:18:44,113 --> 01:18:45,943
He's not in here.

1222
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,050
Is he fuckin' here?!

1223
01:18:55,888 --> 01:18:58,641
You can't ever pull that
trigger. You understand me?

1224
01:18:58,642 --> 01:19:01,325
You pull that trigger,
you're no better than I am.

1225
01:19:01,326 --> 01:19:04,430
We get everybody to go back
to the edge of the perimeter,

1226
01:19:04,431 --> 01:19:07,351
and we work our way back in.

1227
01:19:07,397 --> 01:19:09,299
We'll go to
your uncle Eddie's house.

1228
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:10,300
Come on.

1229
01:19:55,065 --> 01:19:56,933
- Hey, uncle Eddie.
- Michael.

1230
01:19:56,934 --> 01:19:59,074
Just pull the sleeve.

1231
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:06,949
I got it.

1232
01:20:16,213 --> 01:20:18,903
don't wipe off the tattoo.

1233
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:22,818
Thanks.

1234
01:20:23,019 --> 01:20:24,389
There you go.

1235
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:27,961
What the hell happened
to you?

1236
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:29,556
We were jumped.

1237
01:20:29,557 --> 01:20:31,392
Over on,
uh...Bedford Avenue.

1238
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:33,194
One of 'em had a knife
this long.

1239
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:34,195
Hm.

1240
01:20:34,361 --> 01:20:35,829
Took my wallet, too.

1241
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:36,830
Oh.

1242
01:20:37,764 --> 01:20:40,432
Where's mom?
Is she asleep?

1243
01:20:40,433 --> 01:20:43,067
Mom is in
the hospital again.

1244
01:20:43,068 --> 01:20:44,388
Jesus Christ.

1245
01:20:44,837 --> 01:20:45,837
Yeah.

1246
01:20:49,839 --> 01:20:53,192
What you got yourself
into now, Jimmy?

1247
01:20:53,193 --> 01:20:55,853
It's been all over TV.
All night long.

1248
01:20:55,854 --> 01:20:58,479
Showin' your picture.
Cops come here.

1249
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,946
Asking me,
have I seen you?

1250
01:20:59,947 --> 01:21:02,481
Do I know where you guys are,
both of yous?

1251
01:21:02,482 --> 01:21:04,582
So, what's going on?

1252
01:21:06,551 --> 01:21:08,352
I'll need your car.

1253
01:21:08,353 --> 01:21:11,086
Mike and I need to lay low
for a while.

1254
01:21:11,087 --> 01:21:15,893
It wasn't enough that you ruined
your own fuckin' life?

1255
01:21:15,894 --> 01:21:18,328
Now you're gonna bring Michael
into this?

1256
01:21:18,329 --> 01:21:20,728
I'm not bringing Michael
into anything.

1257
01:21:20,729 --> 01:21:22,395
I'm trying to get him out.

1258
01:21:22,396 --> 01:21:24,131
Who you running from
this time, huh?

1259
01:21:24,132 --> 01:21:25,542
Shawn Maguire.

1260
01:21:26,668 --> 01:21:28,448
I killed his son.

1261
01:21:29,237 --> 01:21:30,787
I killed Danny.

1262
01:21:34,839 --> 01:21:36,739
Get the fuck out of my house! Hey, hey.

1263
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:37,873
Get the fuck out of here!

1264
01:21:37,874 --> 01:21:39,373
It's not his fault
this time.

1265
01:21:39,374 --> 01:21:40,775
He's trying to get me
out of this.

1266
01:21:40,776 --> 01:21:42,978
No, he's not trying to get you
out of this, Michael.

1267
01:21:42,979 --> 01:21:44,813
He's not.
He's only loyal to one person.

1268
01:21:44,814 --> 01:21:46,712
He's gonna turn you over
to Shawn.

1269
01:21:46,713 --> 01:21:48,716
I'm his son. He's not gonna turn
me over to Shawn.

1270
01:21:48,717 --> 01:21:52,586
He killed his own cousin
for Shawn Maguire.

1271
01:21:52,587 --> 01:21:55,155
What the fuck
you talkin' about?

1272
01:21:55,156 --> 01:21:58,886
I'm talking about
your cousin Billy.

1273
01:22:01,025 --> 01:22:03,526
N- n-no.
R- Roy demeo's guys killed Billy.

1274
01:22:03,527 --> 01:22:05,617
Everybody knows that.

1275
01:22:05,861 --> 01:22:10,731
For god's sake, Jimmy.
Tell your son the truth.

1276
01:22:11,599 --> 01:22:13,509
Billy had problems.

1277
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:16,419
Yeah. Sure.
Billy had problems.

1278
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:19,070
He couldn't quite
quit the dope.

1279
01:22:19,071 --> 01:22:21,941
Billy used to follow Jimmy
and Shawn around everywhere.

1280
01:22:21,942 --> 01:22:24,809
He thought they were some kind
of goddamn heroes.

1281
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:26,978
And then the night
he got pinched,

1282
01:22:26,979 --> 01:22:29,077
the d.A. Wanted him
to rat out Shawn.

1283
01:22:29,078 --> 01:22:31,981
Otherwise, they were gonna
lock him up for ten years.

1284
01:22:31,982 --> 01:22:35,416
And he's just a kid,
and he's scared to death.

1285
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:36,683
And he was gonna talk.

1286
01:22:36,684 --> 01:22:39,486
But Jimmy, he wasn't gonna
let that happen.

1287
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:41,127
Were you, Jimmy?

1288
01:22:46,491 --> 01:22:50,928
I had to tell the boy.
He can't trust you.

1289
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:51,929
Mike!

1290
01:22:53,448 --> 01:22:54,448
Wait!

1291
01:22:55,898 --> 01:22:58,258
Michael. Wait.
Michael!

1292
01:23:07,273 --> 01:23:08,273
Here.

1293
01:23:09,807 --> 01:23:14,807
Whose side are you gonna choose
this time, Jimmy?

1294
01:23:29,889 --> 01:23:30,889
E.R.

1295
01:23:32,792 --> 01:23:34,710
Yeah, Cheryl's off tonight.

1296
01:23:34,711 --> 01:23:37,311
Yes.
How can I help you?

1297
01:23:55,208 --> 01:23:56,208
Ma.

1298
01:24:12,154 --> 01:24:13,154
Ma.

1299
01:24:13,206 --> 01:24:14,206
Mm.

1300
01:25:35,382 --> 01:25:37,432
We heard from price?

1301
01:25:38,118 --> 01:25:39,118
Not yet.

1302
01:25:51,026 --> 01:25:52,216
Is it done?

1303
01:25:52,845 --> 01:25:54,395
Not yet, Shawn.

1304
01:25:54,595 --> 01:25:56,264
I'm giving you
one more chance

1305
01:25:56,265 --> 01:25:57,865
to walk away from this.

1306
01:25:57,866 --> 01:26:01,326
You're giving me
one more chance?

1307
01:26:03,003 --> 01:26:05,838
That's right. As long as
you're comin' after Michael,

1308
01:26:05,839 --> 01:26:07,656
I'm comin' after you.

1309
01:26:07,657 --> 01:26:09,387
Walk away, Shawn.

1310
01:26:09,406 --> 01:26:12,275
Walk away to what, Jimmy?
Huh?

1311
01:26:12,276 --> 01:26:15,512
Ain't got nothing left
to walk back to anymore.

1312
01:26:15,513 --> 01:26:17,097
This is between you and me.

1313
01:26:17,098 --> 01:26:18,647
Leave my son out of it.

1314
01:26:18,648 --> 01:26:19,648
Fuck you.

1315
01:26:22,049 --> 01:26:24,851
Then we do like
you always said.

1316
01:26:24,852 --> 01:26:27,620
We cross
that line together.

1317
01:26:27,621 --> 01:26:28,671
Right now.

1318
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:47,468
Tell everyone to get ready.

1319
01:26:47,469 --> 01:26:49,019
Jimmy's comin'.

1320
01:26:55,907 --> 01:26:57,709
I'll take another, Terry.

1321
01:26:57,710 --> 01:26:59,411
All right.

1322

01:30:35,737 --> 01:30:36,737
Yeah.

1345
01:30:37,603 --> 01:30:42,472
Growin' up, all we wanted
was to be like those guys

1346
01:30:42,473 --> 01:30:45,709
we saw walkin' down to their
social clubs on tenth Avenue.

1347
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:47,310
Now look at us.

1348
01:30:48,878 --> 01:30:52,748
I never wanted
to be like those guys.

1349
01:30:52,983 --> 01:30:57,052
All I wanted was
to be like you, Shawn.

1350
01:30:57,053 --> 01:30:58,833
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1351
01:32:30,419 --> 01:32:31,649
Shawn. Stop.

1352
01:32:35,756 --> 01:32:37,306
Come on, Shawn.

1353
01:33:40,871 --> 01:33:41,871
Ji...

1354
01:34:35,178 --> 01:34:38,188
We got a walk-in.
Young kid.

1355
01:34:39,014 --> 01:34:43,514
Says he's got information
about Mike conlon.

1356
01:34:53,023 --> 01:34:54,023
Get down!

1357
01:34:55,059 --> 01:34:57,327
Why didn't you bring this
to me earlier?

1358
01:34:57,328 --> 01:34:58,561
I thought they killed Mike

1359
01:34:58,562 --> 01:35:00,062
and maybe they were
comin' after me.

1360
01:35:00,063 --> 01:35:01,696
My little brother found me

1361
01:35:01,697 --> 01:35:04,199
at my friend's place
and told me that Mike came by

1362
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,167
the apartment
and said he was in trouble.

1363
01:35:06,168 --> 01:35:08,167
So...That's why I'm here.

1364
01:35:08,168 --> 01:35:10,403
And tell me
how you know Mike again?

1365
01:35:10,404 --> 01:35:12,570
Trains me down at the gym
on fourth ave.

1366
01:35:12,571 --> 01:35:17,973
They, uh...They got a program
for kids who don't got dads.

1367
01:35:17,974 --> 01:35:19,574
He's my mentor.

1368
01:35:22,278 --> 01:35:24,112
All right. Sit tight.
I'll be right back.

1369
01:35:24,113 --> 01:35:26,415
Call ballistics. Tell 'em to
check Danny Maguire's gun.

1370
01:35:26,416 --> 01:35:27,682
See if it matches the bullets

1371
01:35:27,683 --> 01:35:29,449
- in the Albanians the patrol
found earlier. - All right. Got it.

1372
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:31,085
Call for you, Harding.
Line two.

1373
01:35:31,086 --> 01:35:32,687
Tell 'em I left
for the night.

1374
01:35:32,688 --> 01:35:33,819
It's Michael conlon.

1375
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:37,280
Says he wants
to turn himself in.

1376
01:35:39,658 --> 01:35:40,658
Michael.

1377
01:35:50,433 --> 01:35:52,452
I won the first round, so...

1378
01:35:52,453 --> 01:35:54,437
You won the first round?

1379
01:35:54,438 --> 01:35:55,438
Green!

1380
01:35:55,936 --> 01:35:57,806
Catching up to me.

1381
01:35:58,504 --> 01:36:02,964
- I can go in.
- I need orange, red, green.

1382
01:36:07,945 --> 01:36:08,945
You lose!

1383
01:36:14,215 --> 01:36:16,050
I'm getting over here.

1384
01:36:16,051 --> 01:36:19,021
What the fuck
are you doin' here?

1385
01:36:19,022 --> 01:36:21,302
Cops are on their way.

1386
01:36:21,322 --> 01:36:23,691
I'd get the hell out of here,
if I were you.

1387
01:36:23,692 --> 01:36:25,490
I'm too old to run.

1388
01:36:25,491 --> 01:36:28,951
Where the hell
would I go anyway?

1389
01:36:29,996 --> 01:36:31,956
It's over, Michael.

1390
01:36:31,996 --> 01:36:36,234
You and your family don't have
to worry about Shawn no more.

1391
01:36:36,235 --> 01:36:37,633
When the cops get here,

1392
01:36:37,634 --> 01:36:40,837
I'll tell them everything
they wanna hear.

1393
01:36:40,838 --> 01:36:45,438
That you...Didn't have any part
in all this.

1394
01:36:46,073 --> 01:36:49,583
You mi-you mind
if I wait inside?

1395
01:36:50,061 --> 01:36:53,111
The girls
are still in there.

1396
01:36:55,713 --> 01:36:56,943
Yeah. Right.

1397
01:37:03,186 --> 01:37:05,188
It's nice
to finally meet you.

1398
01:37:05,189 --> 01:37:06,559
I'm Gabriela.

1399
01:37:06,623 --> 01:37:07,623
Hi.

1400
01:37:10,091 --> 01:37:13,411
Nice to meet you, too,
Gabriela.

1401
01:37:13,962 --> 01:37:15,191
Why don't we go inside.

1402
01:37:15,192 --> 01:37:17,922
- Babe.
- Let's go inside.

1403
01:37:23,768 --> 01:37:24,768
Okay.

1404
01:37:30,172 --> 01:37:31,172
Girls?

1405
01:37:32,542 --> 01:37:33,542
Girls.

1406
01:37:34,842 --> 01:37:37,342
This is your grandfather.

1407
01:37:39,178 --> 01:37:40,379
Hi. My name's catelyn.

1408
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:42,714
Well, hi, catelyn.
I'm Jimmy.

1409
01:37:42,715 --> 01:37:45,433
Nice to meet ya.
You're a pretty girl.

1410
01:37:45,434 --> 01:37:48,118
Why were you standing
by my house earlier?

1411
01:37:48,119 --> 01:37:51,489
Uh...
I was waitin' on your dad.

1412
01:37:52,523 --> 01:37:54,422
- Did you get all wet?
- Oh, just a little.

1413
01:37:54,423 --> 01:37:56,490
Wanna say hi
to your grandfather?

1414
01:37:56,491 --> 01:37:58,860
Could we go feed
the ducks now, mommy?

1415
01:37:58,861 --> 01:38:02,691
Come on.
Let's go put your coats on.

1416
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,101
- Okay, Lily, you got the bread?
- Yep.

1417
01:38:11,102 --> 01:38:12,569
- You're gonna hold on to it?
- Got it!

1418
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:15,238
You have to give some
to your sister, too, okay?

1419
01:38:15,239 --> 01:38:17,299
No, I won't eat it.

1420
01:38:17,342 --> 01:38:18,352
Let's go.

1421
01:38:19,375 --> 01:38:22,075
- I'm gonna go and keep 'em busy.
- Okay. All right.

1422
01:38:22,076 --> 01:38:24,747
I don't want the girls to be
here when the cops come around.

1423
01:38:24,748 --> 01:38:28,478
Yeah. Yeah,
they shouldn't see that.

1424
01:38:30,984 --> 01:38:32,664
Goodbye, Michael.

1425
01:38:47,196 --> 01:38:48,196
Duckie.

1426
01:38:48,496 --> 01:38:50,432
Remember to walk
really slowly, okay?

1427
01:38:50,433 --> 01:38:53,533
You don't want
to scare them.

1428
01:40:10,857 --> 01:40:11,857
You okay?

1429
01:40:12,759 --> 01:40:13,759
Mm.

1430
01:40:15,026 --> 01:40:16,026
Roll...

1431
01:40:18,828 --> 01:40:21,428
I gotta go back up there.

1432
01:40:23,299 --> 01:40:25,669
- It's for me.
- Okay.

1433
01:40:27,235 --> 01:40:29,245
I'll be right back.

1434
01:40:51,353 --> 01:40:53,556
Get the girls out of here.

1435
01:40:53,557 --> 01:40:55,477
Come on, let's go.

1436
01:41:21,141 --> 01:41:24,231
Stay quiet, honey.
Stay quiet.

1437
01:41:36,286 --> 01:41:37,286
Oh, god.

1438
01:42:29,925 --> 01:42:32,705
Where's daddy?
I'm scared.

1439
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:33,730
Shh!

1440
01:42:39,232 --> 01:42:40,665
Shh!
It's okay, honey.

1441
01:42:40,666 --> 01:42:44,036
Shh!
You have to be quiet-quiet.

1442
01:43:52,019 --> 01:43:53,789
Gabriela, ruuuuun!

1443
01:45:40,866 --> 01:45:46,006
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

1444
01:46:15,124 --> 01:46:16,124
Dad?

1445
01:46:18,326 --> 01:46:19,326
Dad?

1446
01:46:34,037 --> 01:46:35,037
Mike!

1447
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:37,490
Put that gun down!

1448
01:46:37,491 --> 01:46:38,537
I'm-I'm-I'm innocent!

1449
01:46:38,538 --> 01:46:40,575
- I know.
- I didn't do anything!

1450
01:46:40,576 --> 01:46:44,726
I know.
I need you to put the gun down.

1451
01:46:59,389 --> 01:47:02,659
Get on the outside, legs.
Get on the outside.

1452
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:05,494
Get off the ropes, legs.
Get off the ropes.

1453
01:47:05,495 --> 01:47:07,461
There you go.
Roll to the left.

1454
01:47:07,462 --> 01:47:08,963
Get outta there.
Check him with a jab.

1455
01:47:08,964 --> 01:47:10,966
There you go.
There you go.

1456
01:47:10,967 --> 01:47:12,697
Quick feet.
Yes!

1457
01:47:13,166 --> 01:47:14,306
Two! Three!

1458
01:47:14,969 --> 01:47:16,701
- He's done.
- Four!

1459
01:47:16,702 --> 01:47:18,102
Five! It's over!

1460
01:47:18,103 --> 01:47:20,305
That's what I'm talking about.

1461
01:47:20,306 --> 01:47:23,716
Beautiful!
Now get in the middle.

1462
01:47:27,577 --> 01:47:29,662
You're gonna get
a big, big sugar rush.

1463
01:47:29,663 --> 01:47:31,713
Here. Take the nose.
Put that there, like this.

1464
01:47:31,714 --> 01:47:33,413
- There you go. Hey.
- Daddy!

1465
01:47:33,414 --> 01:47:35,014
- What's that supposed to be, Cate?
- Frosty the snowman, duh.

1466
01:47:35,015 --> 01:47:36,551
Duh!
What about you, sweetheart?

1467
01:47:36,552 --> 01:47:38,350
Rudolph the reindeer.

1468
01:47:38,351 --> 01:47:39,787
Aw. He's so pretty I might have
to take a bite.

1469
01:47:39,788 --> 01:47:41,253
No, daddy!
It's mine!

1470
01:47:41,254 --> 01:47:43,222
Okay,
I won't do anything.

1471
01:47:43,223 --> 01:47:45,157
I gotta go get ready
for work.

1472
01:47:45,158 --> 01:47:47,578
don't take all of them.
