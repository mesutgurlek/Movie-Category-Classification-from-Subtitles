1
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:20,683
MARSHLAND

2
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:40,452
SEPTEMBER 20TH, 1980

3
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,460
We thought you weren't coming.

4
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,587
Our car broke down.

5
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,467
We gave one of the rooms away.

6
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,844
You'll have to share a room tonight.

7
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,472
- Upstairs on the right.
- Thanks.

8
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,817
Your new country.

9
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:09,250
We'll grab dinner and go to bed.
We want to start first thing.

10
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,629
Yeah, I miss you. A lot.

11
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,256
How are you'?

12
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,509
Have you been throwing up'?

13
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:24,223
Sure.

14
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,686
I have to go.
We'll talk tomorrow.

15
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:34,733
Estrella's the eldest, she's 17.
Carmen is 15, I think.

16
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,277
Sixteen.
- Hey.

17
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,820
Excuse me.

18
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,407
- Where were they seen last'?
- At the edge of town.

19
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,866
Their father runs the ferry
at the Point.

20
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,493
They live a couple miles
down the road.

21
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:49,248
They were walking home.
A neighbor saw them get in a car.

22
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:50,499
She's the last one who saw them.

23
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,668
- What kind of car?
- A Citroén.

24
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,877
Model'?

25
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,547
A Dyane 6 or a 2CV.
The lady isn't sure.

26
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:57,798
How long ago was that?

27
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,591
- Three days.
- Nice marinade. What fish is it?

28
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:00,467
Striped mullet.

29
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:01,635
Never tried it.

30
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,220
Very tasty.

31
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,807
Is this the first time
they've gone missing?

32
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,892
No. They have a reputation.

33
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,687
But they were always home
by bedtime.

34
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:13,147
What for?

35
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,024
A reputation. You know.

36
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,109
No, I don't.

37
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,154
They like to have a good time.

38
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,613
You don't'?

39
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,534
A reputation for being easy.

40
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,999
Give me another ten.

41
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,302
Bad time to pick on the military.

42
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,017
What that fascist said
is antidemocratic.

43
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,020
All I did was write a letter
to the paper. That's not a crime.

44
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,731
This country isn't a democracy.
They're not used to it.

45
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,193
You can't criticize a general
and expect a pat on the back.

46
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,694
The military still has power.

47
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:02,780
So what do we do'?

48
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,990
Leave it like it was?

49
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,160
Look where it got you.

50
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,412
- Yeah, with you.
- No.

51
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,498
I'm not the cop with a future
in Madrid.

52
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,917
For me this isn't a punishment.
I don't want to be a hero.

53
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,671
You'd rather extort money
from hookers and bars.

54
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,423
Who told you that?

55
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,218
- I have a good ear.
- What else have you heard?

56
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,428
That's not enough for you'?

57
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,600
A bottle of sweet wine
and two glasses.

58
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,229
No, one.

59
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,231
Good night.

60
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,339
What are they drinking?

61
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,092
- Gin.
- Gin?

62
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,053
Give them another round.
Is this enough?

63
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,388
Plenty.

64
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,475
And a donut or some churros.
Keep them lucid.

65
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,810
And for you?

66
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,270
Another beer.

67
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,897
I'd better not mix anymore.

68
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,691
Well, okay.

69
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,568
Give me both.

70
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,243
- What time is it'?
- Late.

71
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:35,038
Get up. They gave us a car
while they fix ours.

72
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,294
FAIR WAGES

73
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,629
I heard last night
the girls wanted to leave town.

74
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,506
People talk a lot when they drink.

75
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,716
And go where'?

76
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,176
Anywhere.

77
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,178
Their father wasn't very happy
with them.

78
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:38,644
<i>Rome.</i>

79
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,567
Give these gentlemen some wine.

80
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:58,956
Say when.

81
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,377
When.

82
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,218
- For you?
- No, thank you.

83
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,887
Smells good. What is it?

84
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,097
River crabs.

85
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,306
Spicy?

86
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,229
So what now?

87
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,981
Which is their bedroom?

88
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,505
May I?“

89
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,027
WELCOME TO THE LABOR MARKET

90
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,156
Any idea where they may have gone?

91
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,079
Did you argue about anything?

92
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,048
Notice anything missing?

93
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:34,760
A bankbook, for their savings account.
And clothing.

94
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,929
Do you know why your daughters
wanted to leave?

95
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,807
My daughters didn't want
to go anywhere.

96
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,061
Did anyone want to hurt them'?

97
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,575
- Any money, anything valuable?
- Do you know why you're here?

98
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:03,205
- To find your daughters.
- No one gives a shit about them.

99
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:06,667
You're here because her cousin
served with Judge Andrade.

100
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,378
So skip the song and dance
and just find them.

101
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,047
Lunch.

102
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,298
I'm coming.

103
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,889
I found it in the brazier.

104
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:24,309
Please don't tell my husband.
If he finds out he'll kill them.

105
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,104
They've already brought him
enough shame.

106
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,438
- Were they with anyone'?
- They were alone.

107
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:10,313
Did you talk to them'?

108
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:11,982
They were far away.

109
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,067
We were with them after that.

110
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,152
Where?

111
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:18,363
At the bumper cars for a while,
then we went home.

112
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,906
- What time was it?
- Midnight.

113
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,117
I know because we had to go.

114
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,536
- Where did you leave them?
- On the road.

115
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:25,912
At the edge of town.

116
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,415
- Did they have boyfriends?
- No.

117
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,959
Is it true they wanted to leave town?

118
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,836
- Who doesn't?
- I don't.

119
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,005
- You're lame.
- And you're jealous.

120
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,256
Okay.

121
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:38,467
Did they ever say where?

122
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,469
Anywhere is better than this.

123
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,555
Any friends with a white car,
a Citrfiien?

124
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:44,890
No.

125
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,186
It's Quini.

126
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:50,896
What'?

127
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,190
Her boyfriend is outside.

128
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,110
Can we go now'?

129
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:58,945
You can leave.

130
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,243
- Your son?
- The youngest. He's in Germany.

131
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,287
He's been working there for two years.

132
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,331
I have two more in Barcelona

133
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,374
and my daughter's in France.

134
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,210
Can you tell me what you saw?

135
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,878
On the bend.

136
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,421
That's where it stopped.

137
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,173
Did you see how many people
were in the car?

138
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,424
No.

139
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:20,467
Were they forced into the car?

140
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,970
I think they knew each other.
Because they were laughing.

141
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,139
I drew a sketch for you.

142
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,893
This one is a 20V,
with round headlights on the hood.

143
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,145
And the Dyane 6
has them built in.

144
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,773
It was more like this one.

145
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,191
The Dyane 6.

146
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,028
- Who are they?
- Pickers.

147
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,196
Here for the harvest.

148
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,492
He's from the town.
They know him.

149
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,911
Could be a picker
who comes every year.

150
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,871
Or someone who works
at the fair.

151
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,083
The father has a Dyane 6.
Yellow.

152
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,001
It was parked outside the house.

153
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,628
Yellow looks like white at night.

154
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,881
- And gray. It's a common car.
- Excuse me.

155
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,551
Someone wants to talk to you.

156
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,811
Angelita is psychic,
she sees stuff.

157
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,521
She talks to the dead in her sleep.

158
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:19,150
She asks them what she wants to know
and the dead tell her.

159
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,470
Have a seat.

160
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,816
I've been talking to my dead mother
the last two nights

161
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,443
and she said

162
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,696
she saw the girls
at the abandoned farmhouse.

163
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,584
Something wrong?

164
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,169
Nothing.

165
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:10,387
LONG LIVE FRANCO
VICTORY WAS OURS AND ALWAYS WILL BE

166
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,404
Pedro!

167
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,781
Over here!

168
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,410
What's up?

169
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,677
I'll get the car.

170
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,432
I'll see if I can reach it.

171
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,243
I'm almost touching the water.

172
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,162
Careful!

173
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,540
Are you okay'?

174
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,170
I got it, pull me up!

175
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,600
Estrella was wearing hose
like those.

176
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,468
Freeze!

177
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:57,887
Stop!

178
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,440
Why are you running?

179
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,569
- I don't have a permit.
- What is that?

180
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:13,987
A baby deer?

181
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:15,655
Roebuck.

182
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,323
Where are you from?

183
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:18,825
The town.

184
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:20,994
Get up.

185
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,125
What's your name?

186
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,376
Jesus.

187
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,296
You and I met the other night
at the fair, remember?

188
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,298
My head still hurts from the gin.

189
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,508
How did you get here'?

190
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,968
I walked.

191
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,344
It's a long walk.

192
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,138
Not if you know the trails.

193
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,307
See anyone go in or out
of the farmhouse?

194
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,934
I don't like that place.
Nothing but ghosts around.

195
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,269
Can I go?

196
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,232
How much do you get for Bambi?

197
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,318
250 pesetas a kilo.

198
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,445
Don't sell it, you owe us.

199
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,489
So find someone who knows
how to cook it.

200
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,118
Son of a bitch!

201
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,329
Get out of here
or I'll peg you in the head!

202
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,705
Find anything?

203
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,165
No, nothing.

204
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:08,708
In the well'?

205
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,127
Garbage.

206
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,316
Tie up the geese,
I need to take a leak.

207
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,201
- Ab"elardo!

208
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,453
Abelardo, come here!

209
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,306
Carmen.

210
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:22,991
Estrellla.

211
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,833
Go back to the car,
I forgot my notebook.

212
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:02,530
- Where was that?
- Back there.

213
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,450
Then why are you putting it here?

214
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,368
- With the other stuff.
- What stuff?

215
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,371
The pile. All together
so nothing gets lost.

216
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,081
I'll put it back if you want.

217
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,334
No, leave it there.
Don't touch anything else.

218
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,299
Write this down.

219
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,217
Apart from the breasts...

220
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,970
Several cuts, apparently stab wounds.

221
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,765
First degree burn on the left hand.

222
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,226
Let's move to the other body.

223
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:40,026
Write down that she has cuts
across her neck, abdomen and thorax.

224
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:43,738
Three fingers cut off
on her left hand.

225
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,079
Signs of vaginal injury.

226
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,498
She was probably raped
like her sister.

227
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,708
Help me turn her over.

228
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:00,380
She was forced from behind too.

229
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:11,641
They have been in the water
for two days.

230
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,852
- Where does this road lead?
- To the river.

231
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:21,776
What are those photos for'?

232
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:22,860
El Caso.

233
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,570
- How did you find out'?
- I got a call.

234
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,489
- Who?
- I don't know.

235
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,199
Get out of here.

236
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,205
Weren't you listening?
Get the hell out of here!

237
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:35,998
I'm leaving, I'm leaving!

238
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,500
Go on.

239
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:52,098
Handle this discreetly and solve it
as soon as possible.

240
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,392
I promise you'll be rewarded.

241
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,811
The harvest begins soon
and we can't lose it.

242
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:59,856
We already have enough problems
with the strike.

243
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,489
Your ticket back to Madrid.

244
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:13,035
They weren't killed here,
there's no blood.

245
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,413
Someone drove them here
and dumped them.

246
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,165
The tire tracks double back.

247
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,584
He changed his mind
and turned around.

248
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,878
Maybe he saw someone and got nervous.

249
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,299
Someone has to tell the parents.

250
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,009
You're from here, they know you.

251
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,385
You guys do it.

252
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:32,096
We have to see them every day.

253
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:37,435
I'll do it.

254
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,571
Let's get a drink.

255
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,167
Thanks.

256
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,508
Excuse me.

257
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:35,177
This came for you earlier.

258
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,974
And your wife called.
She said to call her back.

259
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,191
What's wrong?

260
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:33,653
A guy wants to see you.
He's drunk and he has a shotgun.

261
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,624
Who are you guys?

262
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,085
We're police.

263
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,253
We heard you wanted to see us.

264
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,838
Put down the shotgun.

265
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,383
No, you guys aren't cops.

266
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,594
We don't sleep in uniform.
Put that down.

267
00:27:58,761 --> 00:27:59,679
Wanna see my badge?

268
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:00,805
Stay back.

269
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:10,272
I'll show you my badge
and you put down the shotgun.

270
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,489
It's not loaded.

271
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,991
I only wanted to talk.

272
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:22,827
I'm sorry.

273
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,956
Beatriz was my girlfriend.

274
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:29,709
He killed her.

275
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,839
He killed Adela too.

276
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,927
He chops them up
and dumps them in the river.

277
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:42,179
That's why they only found the foot.

278
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,556
What foot?

279
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,977
It was her shoe.

280
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:50,855
I gave it to her.

281
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,943
She said she was coming back.

282
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,154
Back from where?

283
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,614
The Costa del Sol.

284
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:03,826
She found a job there.

285
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:08,080
She loved me.

286
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,709
Nobody commits suicide
with a suitcase.

287
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,086
What suitcase'?

288
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,713
Hers.

289
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,883
They found it floating
in the river.

290
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:28,434
Castro.

291
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,811
Who was it?

292
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,109
I don't know.

293
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:54,770
We got back to the hotel late.
I didn't want to wake you.

294
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:56,730
Late means late.

295
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,608
What do I do if there's no phone,
paint one?

296
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,694
I'm working, don't start.

297
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:04,572
I am calm. You're the one who isn't.

298
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,282
Good morning.

299
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:09,743
I'm sorry.

300
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,885
- Morning.
- Morning.

301
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,598
<i>Try the manteca coioré.</i>

302
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,391
I'm not hungry.

303
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:38,856
The girls' autopsy just came.

304
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:44,153
Estrella's pantyhose had semen on them.

305
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,780
Blood type AB.

306
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:50,618
I talked to Miguel.

307
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,747
I asked him for a list
of all the Dyane 6's in the area.

308
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:55,956
When did you talk to him?

309
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,168
Early.

310
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:00,920
You never sleep?

311
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,006
- Sure I do.
- When?

312
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:07,176
When you do, that's why
you never see me.

313
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:47,800
The forensic said
it was a boat propeller.

314
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,849
Nobody in her family knew
she was leaving town to work.

315
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,778
The girls had one just like it.

316
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:15,035
JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN

317
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,209
These places aren't on the map.

318
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:24,169
We don't know where they are.

319
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:30,092
- What's in it for me?
- What do you want?

320
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,015
What size are those?

321
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:38,350
Size big.

322
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:42,104
These places are hard to find.

323
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:46,400
Almost 500 pesetas.

324
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:57,536
Five hundred.

325
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,580
And the smokes.

326
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,666
For the ride.

327
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,732
I told you, nobody lives there.
It's abandoned.

328
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,199
Want me to open it?

329
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,604
Looks like they left in a hurry.

330
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:09,858
They left when they found out
their daughter had drowned.

331
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,444
They couldn't set foot
in the house after that.

332
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,426
You know them'?

333
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:43,225
Beatriz, Estrella and Carmen.
Charlie's Angels.

334
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,811
The one in the middle is Quini.

335
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:41,491
Hi.

336
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:42,701
Hi.

337
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:46,580
<i>His mother disappeared
three years ago.</i>

338
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,874
My husband gave her this cross.

339
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:52,211
She never took it off.
My Adela said it was good luck.

340
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,963
I have something to show you.

341
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:00,010
Did you notice anything strange
before she left?

342
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,096
My granddaughter was very sad
when Quini left her.

343
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:03,972
Quini'?

344
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,892
Quini, from Villa-Franco.
The good-looking one.

345
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:09,811
She didn't say where she was going'?

346
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:13,398
To find work. She said
she'd come back for us after.

347
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:20,530
These books are hers.

348
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,993
She was going to night school
to get her diploma.

349
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:35,170
- Can we take these?
- Please don't lose them.

350
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:36,296
Thank you.

351
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:37,631
Thanks.

352
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,630
Who are you'?
What the fuck do you want?

353
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,134
Okay, okay!

354
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:50,680
You, stay put.

355
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,898
Did you know Carmen and Estrella?

356
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,233
Everyone did.

357
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,901
What was your relationship?

358
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,820
You already know.
I dated Carmen for a couple months.

359
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:05,862
A little young, no?

360
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,072
Young for what?

361
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:13,703
Did you take photos of her?

362
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,830
Do I look like a photographer?

363
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,748
Want me to hit you again?

364
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,628
Where were you
the night they disappeared?

365
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:25,048
September 17th, six days ago.
Where?

366
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,466
With a friend.

367
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,927
Blonde, long hair, 16 years old?

368
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,263
- Is that how you like them?
- Motherfucker!

369
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,434
IStop, stop, stop!

370
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,727
Okay, okay.

371
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:43,650
Where were you?

372
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:50,240
You already know, I was with Marina
the whole time.

373
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:59,124
How do you know her?

374
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,834
I don't.

375
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,880
And this one?

376
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:06,590
Nope.

377
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:09,426
Why are you in the photo?

378
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:11,845
Must have met her that night.

379
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,028
Can I go now'?

380
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,281
Get out.

381
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,288
That's my knife.

382
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,836
Take it.

383
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,574
They're all the same age.

384
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,909
"Very young-

385
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:17,827
Adela disappeared
on September 14th,

386
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:20,497
Beatriz the 15th,
Carmen and Estrella the 17th.

387
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:23,083
In '77, '78 and '80.

388
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,626
During the fair.

389
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,753
- The town is busier.
- People drink more,

390
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,630
it takes longer to notice
someone missing,

391
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:30,257
more people meet...

392
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:32,717
It could be an outsider,
but they all knew Quini.

393
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:33,760
And they all wanted to leave.

394
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,387
Did you see his hand?

395
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:37,931
Triangle tattoo.
Like in the photo.

396
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:40,809
Boss.

397
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,605
What's her name'?
The one in green.

398
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:46,815
Macarena.

399
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,193
Give her this and another round.

400
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:53,863
It's strange.

401
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:54,990
What is?

402
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,284
He's good-looking,
he could have any girl.

403
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,493
Why does he do it?

404
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:09,045
You look tired.
You should go to bed.

405
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:12,632
Take the car, I don't mind.
I'll walk back.

406
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:24,978
<i>Wednesday morning
200 workers with pickets</i>

407
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:27,522
<i>blocked the national highway</i>

408
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:28,732
<i>at four different spots...</i>

409
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,827
- Evening.
- Evening.

410
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,419
Um' 'Q <i>\</i> \ I “Q, 1

411
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:54,341
I'm alone.

412
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:57,052
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, sure.

413
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,887
Just a moment.

414
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:15,570
What can you tell me about this?

415
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:21,034
That she has nice tits.

416
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:22,327
It's Carmen, she's dead.

417
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,997
She had nice tits.

418
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,167
- What can I tell you?
- Whatever you know.

419
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:30,627
Where did you get it'?

420
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:32,128
That's not your concern.

421
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,964
- I'm a journalist.
- Don't make me laugh.

422
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,177
Send it to Madrid.

423
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:41,429
- See what they say.
- I don't have time.

424
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,181
What do you want?

425
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:46,393
Something I don't know.

426
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:50,146
They were tortured.

427
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:52,315
Were they raped?

428
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,663
I read your letter in the paper.
I liked it.

429
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,875
If you catch me younger,
I make you a hero.

430
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,048
It's a very rare film.

431
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,925
Not a common brand.
Imported.

432
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,846
I don't think many people
around here use a roll like that.

433
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:26,266
I can find out who does.

434
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:32,230
But I want the photos
of their cadavers.

435
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:33,815
From the autopsy.

436
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:37,068
I have a family. I have to put
food on the table.

437
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,363
Does your family know what you do'?

438
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,199
My family thinks
I'm the next Truman Capote.

439
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:48,329
He's an American writer.
Never mind.

440
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:50,749
Find out.

441
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:56,212
I've seen your partner too,
but I don't remember where.

442
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:59,215
Do you know if he ever worked
in Vallecas?

443
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,104
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

444
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:56,606
I'm sorry.

445
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:06,032
I found my daughters' bankbook.

446
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:11,079
My husband had it hidden
in the car.

447
00:48:36,456 --> 00:48:39,292
We found this in the glove
compartment of your car.

448
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:50,303
What's going on, Rodrigo?

449
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:56,768
I owe a lot of money.
I can't pay him.

450
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:00,063
Pay who'?

451
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:02,315
A loan shark.

452
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:04,609
Why'?

453
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:08,780
Because I wanted to get
my family out of here.

454
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:14,035
I didn't want my daughters
in this town anymore.

455
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:22,126
You borrowed money
for your daughters?

456
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:03,835
Stgp...

457
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,795
What's wrong with you?

458
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:10,341
What is it?

459
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:12,385
What's wrong?

460
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:16,806
Two months ago I found a brick.
At the Point.

461
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:21,894
A brick of what?
Tobacco?

462
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:24,397
Heroin.

463
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,191
You know what that is'?

464
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,195
How much did it weigh?

465
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:35,658
One kilo.

466
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:38,161
What did you do with it?

467
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:41,581
I sold it.

468
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,710
What did you do with the money?

469
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:50,089
I spent it.

470
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:51,340
On what?

471
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,095
The car outside.

472
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,515
Do you think that's why
they killed your daughters?

473
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:03,144
I don't know.

474
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:07,774
They came here for their money.

475
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,902
They took the washing machine,

476
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,947
the fridge, the television...

477
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:20,787
If I don't pay, they'll take
the car and the boat.

478
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:25,583
We'll have to move away.

479
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,817
We need to talk to the Civil Guard.

480
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:53,194
Have them step up surveillance
at the Point.

481
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:55,738
We have to find
whoever owns that heroin.

482
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:57,406
I'll take the river.

483
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,492
I'll take Quini.

484
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:41,719
HUNTING LODGE FOR RENT

485
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:05,029
Yes.

486
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,032
Okay, thanks a lot.

487
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,118
Marina's at her house.

488
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,454
Her mother says she's fine.

489
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:19,752
The Civil Guard is mixed up
in all of this.

490
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:21,545
Someone's tipping them off.

491
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,631
The whole town smokes
American tobacco

492
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:26,258
and there's not a single butt
on any of the boats.

493
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:29,637
They have to get by on something
between harvests.

494
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:31,347
Go in.

495
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,272
Sit there.

496
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:42,775
I'm fine standing.

497
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,110
Sit, damn it.

498
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:53,869
What were you doing
at the hunting lodge earlier?

499
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:56,247
I was with my girlfriend.
Wanna hear the details?

500
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:57,873
Yes, I do.

501
00:56:58,165 --> 00:56:59,750
Nobody ever explained it to you?

502
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,800
Who's the man in the hat?

503
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:08,926
What man'?

504
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:11,804
The guy who went in after you,
before I got my head bashed in.

505
00:57:11,971 --> 00:57:13,931
Nobody came in.
I told you, we were alone.

506
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:19,228
You want my blood, is that it?

507
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:22,857
Call the doctor, I'll wait.

508
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:29,572
Too bad you didn't bring
your pajamas. You're sleeping here.

509
00:57:38,414 --> 00:57:40,666
<i>...Including Lora del Rio
and other towns.</i>

510
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:43,294
<i>The situation
is becoming very serious.</i>

511
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:46,130
<i>Similar incidents are taking place
as they had</i>

512
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:47,923
<i>in recent years
in the Andalusian countryside.</i>

513
00:57:48,591 --> 00:57:49,300
Damn!

514
00:57:53,596 --> 00:57:54,889
Are you okay'?

515
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:06,775
These are Joaquin Varela's
blood test results. Quini.

516
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:10,196
His blood type doesn't match
the one we're looking for.

517
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:17,870
I remind you this is a democracy.

518
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:22,124
Next time you want to arrest
someone, you ask me first.

519
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:24,084
This country isn't what it was.

520
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:27,838
The harvest is soon
and people are nervous.

521
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:31,091
Please don't waste any more time.
Good day.

522
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,014
You're not going to school today'?

523
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:39,517
I'm sick.
My stomach hurts.

524
00:58:40,518 --> 00:58:42,436
What did you do
yesterday afternoon?

525
00:58:42,895 --> 00:58:44,438
I went to a movie.

526
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,190
With who'?

527
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:48,234
With some friends.

528
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,818
What friends?

529
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:53,572
One moment, I'll be right back.

530
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,249
Who were you with yesterday
at the hunting lodge?

531
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:08,045
Who was the man in the hat,
Marina?

532
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:09,505
What man'?

533
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:12,800
Aren't you a little hot
in that sweater?

534
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:14,426
I'm sick.

535
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:17,388
How did you hurt yourself?

536
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:19,390
- What'?
- You r wrist.

537
00:59:19,682 --> 00:59:21,559
My watch gives me a rash.

538
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,937
Cut the nonsense.
Who was the man in the hat?

539
00:59:25,104 --> 00:59:25,980
I don't know who you mean.

540
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:27,314
- Where's Quini?
- I don't know.

541
00:59:27,523 --> 00:59:28,816
You're sick
and he hasn't come to visit?

542
00:59:28,983 --> 00:59:30,776
- I didn't tell him.
- Why don't you call him?

543
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:31,944
Mom!

544
00:59:32,111 --> 00:59:32,861
Marina, look at me.

545
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:35,447
Does your morn know
what you do at the lodge?

546
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:36,448
Mom!

547
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:38,242
Tell us who the man is
or we'll tell her.

548
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:39,535
Mom!

549
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:43,622
What is it?

550
00:59:43,998 --> 00:59:45,749
I don't feel well.

551
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:47,835
My stomach hurts.
I'm going to throw up.

552
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:49,336
Honey, what's wrong'?

553
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:51,964
Don't worry, ma'am.
We were just leaving.

554
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:54,717
- Thanks for the coffee.
- You're welcome.

555
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:56,760
Marina'?

556
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:05,936
- What are you doing?
- Did you believe a word she said?

557
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:09,273
Me neither. She's scared
and I'm going to find out why.

558
01:00:51,899 --> 01:00:54,193
There are five bedrooms,
each with several beds.

559
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:58,530
I have extra beds
if there are more of you.

560
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:00,991
There's room outside for the dogs.

561
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:04,286
There's water, electricity...
Anyway...

562
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:06,288
All the comforts.

563
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:07,831
- Can I have a look?
- Yes.

564
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:09,833
Do you know the area?

565
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:11,960
Is the house yours'?

566
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:13,170
I wish.

567
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:19,968
We have fans available
if you need them.

568
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:37,778
Whose house is it'?

569
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,030
The owner lives in Valencia.

570
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,741
She hasn't come in years,
she's very old...

571
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:45,536
- Who rented it last'?
- I don't remember.

572
01:01:45,703 --> 01:01:48,038
It's been closed for a long time.
It's the off season.

573
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:52,960
I was here yesterday and I saw
three people enter the house.

574
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,342
Nice, very pretty.

575
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:03,470
You're hurting me!

576
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:07,975
I asked you a question.
Who was here yesterday?

577
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:09,309
I don't know who rents it.

578
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,353
You rent it
and you don't know to who?

579
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:14,440
I rent it to him by the day.

580
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:18,986
He calls me right before
and puts the money in an account.

581
01:02:19,153 --> 01:02:20,320
Lower your voice.

582
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,281
Who's the man in the hat?

583
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:23,323
Who is he'?

584
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:26,452
I don't know anything.
I get paid not to meddle.

585
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:28,954
What are you doing'?

586
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:41,341
What's going on here'?

587
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:45,637
Nothing. These gentlemen came to see
the house. They were just leaving.

588
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:50,559
Good afternoon.

589
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:01,695
- Who is that? Do you know him?
- The watchman?

590
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:03,947
Never seen him in my life.

591
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:33,227
Take a stroll, Jesus.

592
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,319
Drive. I'll tell you where to go.

593
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:14,017
Go inside.

594
01:04:15,936 --> 01:04:17,062
Go on.

595
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:29,449
Have a seat.

596
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:32,327
Eugenio.

597
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:34,621
Give them something to drink,
it's hot.

598
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:42,337
The heroin Rodrigo found was mine,

599
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:44,882
but he didn't find it,
he stole it.

600
01:04:45,716 --> 01:04:47,718
But I didn't kill anyone.

601
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:51,179
That's Fermin over there.
Angelita is his wife.

602
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:53,515
You've already met.
She's not psychic.

603
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:57,686
Fermin was at the farmhouse
the night the girls were killed.

604
01:04:57,978 --> 01:05:01,106
He knows more than what was
in the well. But there's a price.

605
01:05:01,273 --> 01:05:02,065
What do you want?

606
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,568
Withdraw the Civil Guard
from the Point.

607
01:05:06,445 --> 01:05:07,571
Okay or not?

608
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,200
- Okay.
- Tell them, Fermin.

609
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:15,245
I saw the man who threw the bag
in the well.

610
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:16,204
What did he look like'?

611
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:18,081
I didn't see his face,
it was too dark.

612
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:21,418
But he was normal,
a normal person.

613
01:05:21,877 --> 01:05:24,004
It was the same day
the girls disappeared.

614
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:27,549
I was at the farmhouse
waiting for a brick.

615
01:05:27,883 --> 01:05:29,092
It was five in the morning.

616
01:05:29,718 --> 01:05:30,886
What kind of car was it?

617
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:33,597
A white Dyane 6.
He drove right past me.

618
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:37,476
The car had a sticker
on the back window.

619
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:39,227
What kind of sticker?

620
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,813
A woman with long hair
and a hat.

621
01:05:43,357 --> 01:05:44,733
How long? This long'?

622
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:46,985
A little shorter.

623
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:48,987
What was the hat like?

624
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:51,156
Big. Like a priest.

625
01:05:52,783 --> 01:05:53,450
Like this?

626
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:58,330
I've seen this before somewhere.

627
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:06,546
Anything else, Fermin?

628
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:08,340
That's what I saw.

629
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:22,437
Hey.

630
01:06:25,232 --> 01:06:26,900
I did see your problem.

631
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:28,735
The dead are waiting for you.

632
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:30,028
It's almost time.

633
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:25,459
He gave her these towels.

634
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:28,879
They were from the hotel
where he worked in Malaga.

635
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:37,637
- What was her friend's name?
- Sebastian.

636
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:38,722
Sebastian what'?

637
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,474
- I don't know.
- Is he from around here?

638
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,183
I don't know.

639
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,602
- Have you ever seen him'?
- Never.

640
01:07:43,769 --> 01:07:46,104
- What else did she say'?
- That he was nice to her.

641
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,106
That he helped her
get over Quini.

642
01:07:50,859 --> 01:07:51,943
Thank you.

643
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:55,864
Bye, buddy.

644
01:07:56,615 --> 01:07:57,616
Goodbye.

645
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:03,663
His name is Sebastian Rovira Galvez.

646
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,832
He doesn't work at the hotel
anymore. He got fired.

647
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:08,043
They still have some
of his things there.

648
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,087
We need to get them.

649
01:08:23,183 --> 01:08:24,601
MOTHER WITH FRIEND

650
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:52,671
TOMORROW AT 7:30 AT THE CROSS.
GO ALONE.

651
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:30,667
The photos of the girls were taken
with a roll like that one.

652
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:35,797
- Only one place sells them.
- Where?

653
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:37,507
Where are my photos?

654
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:38,925
I don't have them yet.

655
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:40,468
And what do you have?

656
01:09:49,144 --> 01:09:50,687
Aguila Photography, in Seville.

657
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:53,732
Someone places a prepaid order
every month.

658
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:54,733
Who?

659
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:57,652
A good-looking guy named Quini.

660
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:01,281
They develop them there too,
but they wouldn't tell me about them.

661
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:03,658
But definitely not communion photos.

662
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:10,832
I think there's someone else there.

663
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:12,792
You can see the reflection
of whoever took the photo.

664
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:14,669
He's blurred by the flash.

665
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:16,713
Tell me who he is
and you'll get your photos.

666
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:20,425
All right, but I'll need the negative.

667
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,135
Otherwise it's impossible.

668
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:24,930
I won't use it.
You can trust me.

669
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:27,098
Would you trust someone like you?

670
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:32,520
You have my word.

671
01:10:44,616 --> 01:10:45,825
Can he sleep at night?

672
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:47,327
Your partner.

673
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:50,121
I remembered.

674
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:53,833
He was in
the Social-Political Brigade.

675
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,044
You know, Franco's Gestapo.

676
01:10:56,544 --> 01:11:00,215
He killed a girl at a protest
in Vallecas in '71.

677
01:11:00,382 --> 01:11:01,758
Shot her twice.

678
01:11:02,634 --> 01:11:04,261
He's aged badly.

679
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:06,471
And I'm glad.

680
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,367
M-Hello
- How are you'?

681
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:06,466
That's Marina.

682
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:11,346
She and my daughters
were close friends.

683
01:13:13,848 --> 01:13:16,851
Quini took her to the hunting lodge
the other day.

684
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:19,771
After they were together
he asked her not to get dressed

685
01:13:19,938 --> 01:13:21,481
and he tied her to the bed.

686
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:26,069
Then he left the room
and came back with another man.

687
01:13:33,952 --> 01:13:35,120
Who was he'?

688
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:37,956
She didn't see his face.

689
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:41,251
All she knows is he smelled good,
like expensive cologne.

690
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:43,962
And that he had very soft hands.

691
01:13:48,258 --> 01:13:50,176
He took photographs of her.

692
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:53,471
Quini threatened to show them
to everyone in town

693
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:55,306
if she told anyone.

694
01:13:59,269 --> 01:14:01,771
The night my daughters were killed...

695
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:07,944
Marina was with Quini,
but not the whole night.

696
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:16,411
Do you think she'd be able
to tell a judge?

697
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:20,081
She couldn't even tell you.

698
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:32,510
I have to go.

699
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:08,338
Good afternoon.
I'm Pedro Suarez.

700
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:11,341
- The manager is expecting me.
- One moment, please.

701
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:19,224
ACCESS PROHIBITED TO NON-EMPLOYEES

702
01:15:22,769 --> 01:15:23,978
It's this suitcase.

703
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:26,147
- Shall I open it'?
- Yes, open it.

704
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:36,157
The guy was really weird.
He had a problem with a guest.

705
01:15:36,324 --> 01:15:37,450
What problem?

706
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:39,702
Something weird
with a very young girl.

707
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:43,122
I think that's why he vanished
all of a sudden. Poof...

708
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:44,541
...and he was gone.

709
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,215
Rovira Galvez, Sebastian.

710
01:15:52,966 --> 01:15:55,009
Sexual assault on a minor'?

711
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:57,303
Whereabouts unknown...

712
01:15:58,137 --> 01:15:59,973
A two-year-old warrant for his arrest...

713
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:01,558
Anything else?

714
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:03,393
Any friends who know him?

715
01:16:03,977 --> 01:16:05,270
No, he has no family.

716
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:07,438
Nobody in his town
ever saw him again.

717
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:10,108
He didn't even go
to his mother's funeral.

718
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:13,653
Yeah, yeah.

719
01:16:13,945 --> 01:16:15,822
Thank you very much.

720
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:37,719
The wages are nothing!
It's not enough to survive on!

721
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:41,431
You should know
we're going through rough times.

722
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:45,977
Mr. Alfonso is offering
20% more than last year.

723
01:16:46,144 --> 01:16:48,229
150 pesetas more per day.

724
01:16:48,396 --> 01:16:49,606
That's nothing!

725
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:01,576
Silence, please!

726
01:17:01,743 --> 01:17:03,411
170 pesetas.

727
01:17:03,578 --> 01:17:05,204
That's his final offer.

728
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:07,415
Anyone who doesn't want to work
can stay home.

729
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:10,001
We've too many people already.

730
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:11,836
If you want to sign up,
get in line.

731
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:32,398
Sir!
Hey!

732
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:33,733
Hey!

733
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:37,153
Excuse me.

734
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:41,866
Juan Robles. I just wanted
to introduce myself.

735
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:43,326
Alfonso Corrales.

736
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:44,786
I'm with the police.

737
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:45,953
I'm here about the murders.

738
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,497
If I can be of any help...

739
01:17:47,664 --> 01:17:50,249
Let me know if you need anything.
See you around.

740
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:51,501
Thank you.

741
01:20:52,974 --> 01:20:53,933
Yes.

742
01:20:55,393 --> 01:20:57,186
Yes, don't worry.

743
01:20:57,854 --> 01:20:58,479
Of course.

744
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:02,149
Good night, Manuel.
And thanks.

745
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:05,736
<i>The</i> field <i>boss says</i>

746
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:07,989
there's no Dyane 6
on the Corrales property,

747
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:09,657
neither registered or unregistered.

748
01:21:09,824 --> 01:21:11,951
And Marina's mother says
her daughter is at a movie.

749
01:21:13,244 --> 01:21:16,497
I'll call Mr. Corrales tomorrow
and have him come in for a blood test.

750
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:18,499
- It's late for today.
-It's 11 o'clock.

751
01:21:18,666 --> 01:21:22,086
- I don't think it's late.
<i>- I'll</i> call him tomorrow morning.

752
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:24,255
I don't think there will be
any problem.

753
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:27,508
Right now I'm going to have them
check on the girl.

754
01:21:28,175 --> 01:21:30,511
I'm not asking you
to call him on the telephone.

755
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:33,389
I'm asking you to authorize
a blood test.

756
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:34,974
Right now.

757
01:21:35,308 --> 01:21:39,687
And I also want authorization
to question Corrales and Quini together.

758
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:43,524
I heard you were a troublemaker.

759
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:45,026
What did you say?

760
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:46,777
All you have is literature.

761
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:50,281
Your partner saw a man in a hat.
Nothing more.

762
01:21:50,615 --> 01:21:51,324
Isn't that right?

763
01:21:52,742 --> 01:21:53,659
That's right.

764
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:57,705
I wear a hat too.
Does that make me a suspect too?

765
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:02,168
I won't authorize anything until
you bring me something conclusive.

766
01:22:02,335 --> 01:22:05,004
Now please leave.
I'll call you when I hear back.

767
01:22:05,463 --> 01:22:07,214
You're protecting him.

768
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:11,427
What'?

769
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:18,684
You don't know how things
work around here.

770
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:20,686
Yes, I do.
Just like everywhere else.

771
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:24,649
You're going to be a father.

772
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:27,902
You should be more careful
about what you do.

773
01:22:28,903 --> 01:22:30,196
Get out.

774
01:22:41,666 --> 01:22:43,042
Why didn't you say anything?

775
01:22:44,377 --> 01:22:46,295
Whose side are you on?
Are you with them too?

776
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:49,006
I just want to solve this case.
I don't want to be taken off it.

777
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:50,841
You're just like the rest of them.

778
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,260
You'd rather things were like before.

779
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:56,097
I know what you used to do.
I know about Vallecas.

780
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:58,391
You don't know anything.
Nothing!

781
01:23:00,518 --> 01:23:02,687
Be careful who you get your
information from.

782
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:05,147
- That guy is out for blood.
- Let me go.

783
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:14,865
It was an accident.
And it wasn't me.

784
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:18,411
It was my partner.
I didn't even draw my weapon.

785
01:23:19,245 --> 01:23:22,832
If you killed someone,
I'd cover for you too. Is that wrong?

786
01:23:24,542 --> 01:23:26,252
Let's go to Marina's house.

787
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:35,928
<i>No, how could he be the father?
He's 87 years old!</i>

788
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:42,810
<i>Tell them I'll do anything,
I don't</i> care.

789
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:07,418
<i>Hello?</i>

790
01:24:07,585 --> 01:24:08,544
<i>It's me.</i>

791
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:10,546
<i>Hi, Marina.</i>

792
01:24:11,672 --> 01:24:13,591
<i>I wanted to know
what's happening with Malaga.</i>

793
01:24:13,758 --> 01:24:15,426
<i>When will they call me?</i>

794
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:19,055
<i>Look, there was a problem
with your contract.</i>

795
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:21,932
<i>They're not hiring anyone
until next year.</i>

796
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:24,810
<i>Talk to them.</i>

797
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:28,606
<i>Tell them I'll do anything,
I don't</i> care.

798
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:31,609
<i>I have to get out of here.</i>

799
01:24:32,026 --> 01:24:33,819
<i>I can't take it anymore.</i>

800
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:36,947
<i>Let's meet. At the usual spot
in half an hour.</i>

801
01:24:37,865 --> 01:24:40,326
She called this number.
It's the hunting lodge.

802
01:24:51,295 --> 01:24:52,630
It's okay.

803
01:24:55,508 --> 01:24:56,759
Coming!

804
01:24:57,968 --> 01:24:59,428
Who is it'?

805
01:25:04,058 --> 01:25:06,185
- Who else lives in this house?
- Nobody.

806
01:25:06,352 --> 01:25:08,270
- Who?
- The watchman.

807
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:10,189
- What's his name'?
- Antonio.

808
01:25:10,523 --> 01:25:12,483
- Who is Sebastian?
- I don't know.

809
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:13,234
Stop.

810
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,360
Where is Sebastian'?

811
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:16,320
I said stop!

812
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:24,036
Sit down.

813
01:25:37,591 --> 01:25:40,136
Do you know who
Carmen and Estrella were?

814
01:25:44,974 --> 01:25:47,101
Before they killed them,
they tortured them.

815
01:25:50,563 --> 01:25:53,149
With a hunting knife and pliers.

816
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:56,652
They ripped off their nipples.

817
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:00,739
They cut off their toes.

818
01:26:02,533 --> 01:26:07,037
They stuck something in their <i>ass</i>
and vagina until they bled.

819
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:12,459
They were awake the whole time.

820
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:19,091
You can't imagine how much pain
a person can bear before fainting.

821
01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:21,552
I didn't know.

822
01:26:23,888 --> 01:26:26,390
I didn't know, I didn't know...

823
01:26:26,557 --> 01:26:27,683
Look at me.

824
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:32,271
What's the watchman's name'?

825
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:36,942
Sebastian.

826
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:39,570
He came looking for work
and I hired him.

827
01:26:39,737 --> 01:26:41,864
His mother was my friend.

828
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:43,866
He needed to hide.

829
01:26:44,033 --> 01:26:45,242
Hide from what?

830
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:48,746
I don't know.

831
01:26:49,622 --> 01:26:51,498
He had changed a lot.

832
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:54,543
I hardly recognized him.

833
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,420
Do you know Alfonso Corrales?

834
01:26:56,629 --> 01:26:57,755
Yes.

835
01:26:58,547 --> 01:27:00,591
Have you ever seen him
in this house?

836
01:27:00,758 --> 01:27:04,637
I don't come here
when the house is rented out.

837
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:09,141
Where is Sebastian'?

838
01:27:12,937 --> 01:27:13,979
Where?

839
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:19,068
At the abandoned house
at the lodge.

840
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:48,264
Open it.

841
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:24,234
Juan!

842
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:30,866
A contract in Estrella Bianca's name
to work at the Hotel Medio Dia.

843
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:33,035
And there are more,
with other girls' names.

844
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,042
Hey!

845
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:42,920
There goes the car!

846
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:44,588
Come on!

847
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,970
Careful, it's slippery in the rain.

848
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:53,514
Careful!

849
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,139
Careful!

850
01:30:00,646 --> 01:30:02,231
Go, go, go!

851
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:03,982
Ifs stuck.

852
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:05,984
This road leads only to the Marshland.

853
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:09,238
There's a shortcut over here!

854
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,043
Freeze!

855
01:34:39,508 --> 01:34:41,051
Murderer!

856
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:05,325
Yeah? They asked about me?

857
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:06,868
Who?

858
01:35:07,285 --> 01:35:08,912
To congratulate me?

859
01:35:10,706 --> 01:35:13,208
A telegram? Open it.

860
01:35:14,835 --> 01:35:16,878
DEATH IN MARSHLAND
GIRLS BUTCHERED

861
01:35:19,673 --> 01:35:22,676
No, skip that.
Where it says "Destination."

862
01:35:24,386 --> 01:35:26,430
Alcobendas? That's Madrid.

863
01:35:26,722 --> 01:35:28,932
I can practically walk there.

864
01:35:29,808 --> 01:35:31,101
How are you'?

865
01:35:32,102 --> 01:35:34,730
Of course I miss you.
A lot.

866
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:36,773
I can't wait to see you both.

867
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:43,530
Pedro, come here.

868
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:46,700
This is Macarena and...

869
01:35:47,033 --> 01:35:48,785
Don't tell me...
Tell me.

870
01:35:48,952 --> 01:35:50,328
M ariviy

871
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:51,997
Turn around,
let him get a look at you.

872
01:35:52,164 --> 01:35:53,331
Go on, turn.

873
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:55,125
You two are gorgeous.

874
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:56,835
My partner, Pedro.

875
01:35:57,043 --> 01:35:59,212
- Say hi to Pedro.
- Hi, Pedro.

876
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:01,798
They work at the crab factory.

877
01:36:02,174 --> 01:36:04,259
We're celebrating
because they got a raise.

878
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:06,303
They won the strike.

879
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:08,388
Long live the working class!

880
01:36:08,847 --> 01:36:11,433
You want another drink'?
Come on, my treat.

881
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,059
Let's have a drink.

882
01:36:13,226 --> 01:36:14,644
Pedro, Pedro...

883
01:36:14,895 --> 01:36:16,188
Where is it'?

884
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:17,981
Where have you got it?

885
01:36:18,148 --> 01:36:19,316
Right here.

886
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:20,650
Here.

887
01:36:22,611 --> 01:36:24,321
Who's that? Who?

888
01:36:24,738 --> 01:36:26,740
DOUBLE HOMICIDE SOLVED
IN MARSHLAND

889
01:36:27,157 --> 01:36:27,949
It's him.

890
01:36:28,742 --> 01:36:30,869
It's him, he's my friend.

891
01:36:32,496 --> 01:36:33,580
Here, hold onto it.

892
01:36:34,331 --> 01:36:35,665
For your son.

893
01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:38,001
Don't lose it.

894
01:36:38,168 --> 01:36:39,878
Don't lose it, Pedro.

895
01:36:42,589 --> 01:36:44,800
Well? How about that drink?

896
01:37:08,698 --> 01:37:09,908
You're a hero now.

897
01:37:13,411 --> 01:37:14,704
Your photos.

898
01:37:16,873 --> 01:37:19,000
There's somebody else
but you can't see who.

899
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:20,126
It's just a spot.

900
01:37:35,016 --> 01:37:36,101
To Truman Capote.

901
01:37:37,519 --> 01:37:39,145
To Truman Capote.

902
01:37:46,152 --> 01:37:47,988
You were misinformed.
It wasn't him.

903
01:37:48,321 --> 01:37:49,573
It was an accident.

904
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:00,959
A gift.

905
01:38:02,627 --> 01:38:04,671
This enlargement came out better.

906
01:38:05,088 --> 01:38:07,757
Taken the day the girl was killed
at the protest.

907
01:38:11,261 --> 01:38:12,971
They called him the Crow.

908
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:17,225
He alone tortured over 100 people.

909
01:38:18,268 --> 01:38:19,477
And he was the best at it.

910
01:38:25,901 --> 01:38:27,402
Take care, Pedro.

911
01:39:29,798 --> 01:39:32,425
Jesus made us some food for the road.

912
01:39:33,551 --> 01:39:35,345
Here, I owed you this.

913
01:39:35,512 --> 01:39:36,429
What is it?

914
01:39:36,596 --> 01:39:38,390
Bambi stew.

915
01:39:39,975 --> 01:39:41,101
Watch yourself.

916
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:42,686
You too.

917
01:39:56,408 --> 01:39:57,951
We're good, right?
