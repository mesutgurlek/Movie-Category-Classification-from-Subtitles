1
00:00:13,117 --> 00:00:17,851
Brendan watches Steven Avery
take a butcher knife from the kitchen

2
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:20,083
and stab Teresa Halbach in the stomach.

3
00:00:22,117 --> 00:00:24,117
What Steven Avery does then...

4
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:28,517
while Teresa is still begging
for her life...

5
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:32,651
is he hands the knife
to the 16-year-old boy

6
00:00:32,717 --> 00:00:34,918
and instructs him to cut her throat.

7
00:00:39,217 --> 00:00:42,684
Sixteen-year-old Brendan,
under the instruction of Steven Avery...

8
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:46,451
cuts Teresa Halbach's throat,

9
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:50,050
but she still doesn't die.

10
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:53,150
There's additional information

11
00:00:53,217 --> 00:00:57,350
which includes manual strangulation
and gunshot wounds.

12
00:00:57,417 --> 00:01:01,050
After obtaining the information
that was obtained from Brendan,

13
00:01:01,117 --> 00:01:03,284
we felt that there might be areas

14
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,884
that we needed to recheck
for blood evidence,

15
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,050
for items used in the commission
of these crimes.

16
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:15,350
And we are searching his residence and
searching the garage near his residence

17
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:20,017
because we now know that the garage
was part of the crime scene.

18
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:23,684
[male reporter] Is there any DNA evidence
backing up the kid's story?

19
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,250
Yeah, we're not gonna comment on...
on that.

20
00:01:26,317 --> 00:01:31,017
We obviously have a lot of evidence
and I guess we can say that

21
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:37,050
there is a substantial amount of
physical evidence that now makes sense.

24
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,184
The hardest thing about this case
is trying to figure out,

25
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:57,017
now that we've gotten Brendan Dassey
out of the case, we think,

26
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:01,617
unless they decide to call him
on rebuttal or something,

27
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:04,217
how do we deal with the fact
that the jurors already know it all?

28
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:08,684
It's a clever move by them to not
call Brendan in their case in chief.

29
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:11,751
- He's not a good witness.
- Which we predicted months ago.

30
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:14,250
He's, you know... even...

31
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:21,484
once he starts incriminating himself
and Steve, he can't do that consistently.

32
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:25,317
I mean, the story is changing dramatically
every time he tells it.

33
00:03:26,284 --> 00:03:30,217
So... they put it out there
in news conferences.

34
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:33,451
The public knows about it.
They believe it.

35
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:37,717
Um, they think it's the last nail
in Steven's coffin.

36
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:41,517
And now the State leaves us
in a position

37
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:44,517
- of shadowboxing. Um...
- Right.

38
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:47,484
By not putting it in.

39
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:49,918
I think... our best option

40
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:52,983
out of a lot of not so great options is...

41
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:58,918
is to work in ways to disprove this story
as we go, without putting the story in.

42
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:42,818
[man] I got 18:26.

43
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:53,451
[man 2] After we had made entry
into the garage,

44
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:56,983
I had done initial overall photography.

45
00:04:58,717 --> 00:05:02,417
We then spent some time just kind of
walking around the garage, looking.

46
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:06,150
[Kratz] Did you and other investigators

47
00:05:06,217 --> 00:05:09,350
- begin moving items within this garage?
- Yes.

48
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:13,651
We basically started
in the northeast corner of the garage

49
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:18,217
and began to remove items
to see if there was any obvious sign

50
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:22,184
of potential trace evidence on them
or biological evidence.

51
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,651
[Kratz] Are you telling this jury
that every one of those items

52
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:28,983
was handled by law enforcement
and examined?

53
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,751
[Heimerl] Virtually every item, yes.

54
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:33,950
[Kratz] Next, item 266.

55
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:38,317
Did you find anything near that compressor
that you thought was interesting?

56
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:41,050
As we reached this area, I was on...

57
00:05:41,117 --> 00:05:43,017
I had to get onto my hands and my knees

58
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,484
and utilized a flashlight
to look under the compressor.

59
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:50,117
And I saw what appeared to be
a flattened or... a flattened bullet.

60
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,851
[Kratz] I've actually zoomed in
to that area.

61
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:56,584
Tell the jury what
we're looking at here, please.

62
00:05:56,651 --> 00:06:00,117
[Heimerl] The bullet right between
the tent and the scale.

63
00:06:00,884 --> 00:06:03,717
Let's look at exhibit number
2-7-0, please.

64
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:05,818
Tell us what we're looking at here.

65
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:10,751
[Heimerl] This is a medium view photograph
of what was ultimately identified

66
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:14,983
with marker number 23: the bullet
that was found under the compressor.

67
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,884
[Kratz] Can you identify the individual
in this photograph, please?

68
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:22,083
[Heimerl] Detective Dave Remiker from
Manitowoc County Sheriff's Department.

69
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,651
[Strang] November 6.

70
00:06:26,717 --> 00:06:30,818
I think that's the first time
you actually searched the garage

71
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:34,950
rather than... simply sweeping through it
to look for Ms. Halbach?

72
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,551
Yes, I believe so.

73
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:42,250
You folks found some empty shell casings

74
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:45,217
for what looked like .22 caliber rounds?

75
00:06:45,284 --> 00:06:48,884
- Yes.
- Ten of these? Something like that?

76
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,950
- I think 11.
- Eleven?

77
00:06:52,017 --> 00:06:53,751
- I believe so.
- On the floor?

78
00:06:53,818 --> 00:06:54,918
Yes.

79
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:59,818
Uh, where there are shell casings,
there may be bullets?

80
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,651
- We found shell casings.
- Were you looking for bullets?

81
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,983
We were looking for everything.

82
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:12,617
Found no bullets

83
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:17,851
in the search on November 6
of the garage.

84
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:19,184
Correct.

85
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,484
Found no bullets any other time
in Steven Avery's garage

86
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:25,751
any time in November 2005.

87
00:07:26,551 --> 00:07:27,551
[Remiker] Correct.

88
00:07:27,617 --> 00:07:30,651
[Strang] It was March 2, 2006...

89
00:07:32,184 --> 00:07:37,651
and you were present when one bullet
fragment was found in that garage.

90
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:38,884
[Remiker] Correct.

91
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,184
[Strang] Again, March 1 and 2,
you were physically present both days.

92
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,350
Yes.

93
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:51,617
Did you see Lieutenant Lenk there on site
at the Averys' on either day?

94
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:53,217
- In March?
- Yes.

95
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,818
March 1 and March 2.

96
00:07:55,884 --> 00:07:58,584
Yeah, he was there. He was, um...

97
00:07:58,651 --> 00:08:01,217
- Yeah, he was there.
- Both days?

98
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:04,317
I believe so. Yes.

99
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:10,350
[Strang] By March, why do you need
any of the Manitowoc people?

100
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:13,250
You've got two people charged with this.

101
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:17,484
You're searching one garage
and one trailer.

102
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:21,918
That's it. Uh...

103
00:08:21,983 --> 00:08:26,584
And you have a well-established team
of people outside Manitowoc County

104
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:30,851
who now are intimately familiar
with this investigation.

105
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:34,950
You need Manitowoc County
investigators for what?

106
00:08:35,017 --> 00:08:36,517
For what?

107
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,684
On March 1st and March 2nd.

108
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:41,250
[Buting] "Lieutenant Lenk."

109
00:08:41,317 --> 00:08:45,517
Is that his name logged in
on the second to the last line?

110
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:47,451
[Fassbender] Correct.

111
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:50,784
[Buting] Now, this search is the search

112
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:53,651
where a couple of bullet fragments
were discovered, right?

113
00:08:53,717 --> 00:08:57,484
- Yes.
- Five months after the previous searches.

114
00:08:57,551 --> 00:08:59,217
Four months. I keep...

115
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:01,083
My math's bad, I guess.

116
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,284
- Four months?
- Yes.

117
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,784
OK. What was it,

118
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:08,384
five entries to his garage the week
of November 5th to the 12th?

119
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:09,851
Correct.

120
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:13,484
At that time, though,
none of the investigators knew

121
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:18,384
that there would be evidence
that suggested that perhaps...

122
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:21,551
Teresa Halbach had actually
been shot in the head.

123
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:23,918
- That information came later.
- Correct.

124
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:27,818
Shortly before this March 1st
and March 2nd search.

125
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:31,983
I don't know. I'm not sure
when that information came.

126
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:37,083
What I'm talking about here is
by March 1st and March 2nd of 2006,

127
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,384
which are important dates in this
investigation. You know that, right?

128
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:41,451
[Fassbender] Yes.

129
00:09:41,517 --> 00:09:43,117
Additional search warrants
were issued, right?

130
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:44,250
Yes.

131
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:48,350
And by that time,
through all of your investigation,

132
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:51,717
you had found no physical evidence

133
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:58,184
linking Teresa Halbach
to Mr. Avery's trailer or garage...

134
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:01,417
right up to February 28th.

135
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:05,751
I don't believe that's accurate.

136
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:07,250
What'd you find?

137
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:09,050
We found shell casings in the garage

138
00:10:09,117 --> 00:10:11,350
that did match up to a rifle
in the house.

139
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:14,017
I mean, you found shells
all over the place.

140
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,484
Forty acres, right?

141
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:18,317
- Oh, certainly, yes.
- A junkyard.

142
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:22,184
These people were sighting rifles,
you knew that. Shooting rabbits.

143
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:27,317
The mere existence of shells
without a link to a particular body

144
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:28,950
doesn't prove anything, does it?

145
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:32,517
It could've been. You know, we just...
No. We didn't know.

146
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:36,717
OK, so in short, then,
by March 1st and March 2nd...

147
00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:40,117
when those search warrants were issued...

148
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:46,484
four months of investigation
had found not one shred

149
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:51,083
of Teresa Halbach's DNA anywhere

150
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,083
in Mr. Avery's trailer or garage.

151
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,350
Correct.

152
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:57,751
Thank you.

153
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,584
Do you remember on that first search

154
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:06,417
a note with Ms. Halbach's phone number
being seized

155
00:11:06,484 --> 00:11:10,851
- from Mr. Avery's computer table?
- Yes, I do.

156
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:14,083
You recall now that that
was seized on November 5th?

157
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,851
- Yes.
- Would you say that that is some evidence

158
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:21,250
- that is obviously linked to Ms. Halbach?
- Yes.

159
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:26,217
Also found on Mr. Avery's computer table
was a bill of sale.

160
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:29,751
You recall that now being seized
on the 5th of November, don't you?

161
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:32,950
- Yes, I do.
- Let me ask you, Mr. Fassbender,

162
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:35,851
do you know how many items
of physical evidence

163
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:41,818
were seized in this case alone,
the Avery homicide investigation?

164
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:43,884
Upwards of 970.

165
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,384
Can you remember all 970 items of evidence
that were seized?

166
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:48,884
No, I can't.

167
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:53,150
None of those exhibits ever show

168
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:57,884
that Teresa was inside the trailer,
do they?

169
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,284
No.

170
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:03,651
Thank you. That's all I have.

171
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:05,983
[Kratz] That's evidence
that Bobby provided, isn't that right?

172
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,017
- That's correct.
- That's all I've got. Thank you, Judge.

173
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,617
[scoffs]

174
00:12:11,684 --> 00:12:14,551
I object. Move to strike
the question and the answer

175
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:15,950
'cause it's not the testimony.

176
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:19,451
Bobby Dassey never said
he saw her in the trailer.

177
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:20,884
I'm gonna sustain the objection.

178
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,150
I think that's beyond
the scope of redirect.

179
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:36,117
[indistinct chatter]

180
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:39,651
- How's it going?
- Real good.

181
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,050
- How you doing?
- Great.

182
00:12:42,284 --> 00:12:46,684
- Huh?
- They just started. The judge is in.

183
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:48,150
Oh, yeah?

184
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:53,050
Want me to hang your coat?
I can take your coat.

185
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,284
Yeah.

186
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,350
Go ahead.

187
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:04,484
- Allan. Right here.
- [laughs] Wrong door.

188
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,117
Court is already in session
so you need to be real quiet.

189
00:13:10,184 --> 00:13:11,517
Thank you.

190
00:13:17,284 --> 00:13:20,551
[woman] This is the top
of the left eye socket,

191
00:13:20,617 --> 00:13:25,417
the top of the right eye socket,
the left nasal bone.

192
00:13:25,484 --> 00:13:28,417
We also have the entire right cheek bone,

193
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:31,350
as well as a portion
of the left cheek bone

194
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:38,350
and a portion of bone that continues over
and above the opening for the left ear.

195
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,350
[Fallon] And the next photograph?

196
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:42,684
This is exhibit 3-8-4.

197
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:48,350
A sampling of skull fragments,
two fragments in particular,

198
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:53,083
showed defects or unnatural openings.

199
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:57,083
This semi-circular defect here

200
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,484
that has another smaller
unnatural opening here.

201
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:05,284
[Fallon] Was there anything else
about this defect that was unusual?

202
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,451
The cranial bones were taken for x-ray

203
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:11,517
and what I'd like
to call your attention to

204
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:16,384
are these flecks,
called radio opaque particles.

205
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:19,117
What does the presence
of the internal beveling,

206
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:24,184
coupled with the localized radio opaque
particles, signify to you?

207
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:30,551
What those defects look like signifies
what happens to skull bone

208
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:34,451
when it's subjected
to a gunshot or gunshots.

209
00:14:34,517 --> 00:14:35,884
All right, doctor.

210
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,384
Do you have an opinion as to the manner
of death of this individual?

211
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:47,284
The manner of death in this case
was by homicidal violence.

212
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,517
I told you at the beginning
of this case

213
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:10,950
that we would be presenting not only
cause of death but manner of death.

214
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:14,717
And when the jury has to put
this whole puzzle together,

215
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:18,284
the expert opinions by people
like Leslie Eisenberg

216
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,818
should all go a long way towards them
making their final conclusion

217
00:15:21,884 --> 00:15:25,784
as to who it was
who caused the death of Teresa Halbach.

218
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:56,083
[Gahn] I would ask if Detective Wiegert
would bring you exhibit 237.

219
00:15:57,684 --> 00:16:02,417
And can you identify that exhibit
that's in front of you, Ms. Culhane?

220
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:08,617
Yes. [clears throat]
This is crime lab item designation "FL"

221
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:10,484
and it is a lead bullet fragment.

222
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:13,083
And how did you process that bullet?

223
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,851
In order to remove any residual DNA
that might have been on the bullet,

224
00:16:17,918 --> 00:16:19,717
I washed it.

225
00:16:19,784 --> 00:16:24,083
I put it in a test tube and washed it
with some buffer that we use

226
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,050
to extract the DNA.

227
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:29,884
And the liquid is what I performed
the rest of my procedure on.

228
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:35,451
And were you able to develop
a DNA profile from that washing

229
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:39,551
- on item FL, the bullet?
- Yes.

230
00:16:39,617 --> 00:16:44,350
Do you have an opinion to a reasonable
degree of scientific certainty

231
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:49,317
whether Teresa Halbach
is the source of the DNA

232
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:52,350
on item FL, the bullet?

233
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:56,217
Yes. I believe she is the source
of the DNA on the bullet.

234
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:03,918
Um... let me ask you,
did this match differ in any way

235
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:07,083
from the previous matches that you culled?

236
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:08,983
Yes, it did.

237
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,784
And could you explain to the jury
what happened?

238
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:16,950
When we begin the extraction, we begin
what's called a manipulation control.

239
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:20,217
And it's basically
a negative blank control.

240
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:24,083
And it helps us monitor
if any unintentional DNA

241
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,918
is introduced into the sample.

242
00:17:26,983 --> 00:17:28,717
During the extraction procedure,

243
00:17:28,784 --> 00:17:32,751
I inadvertently introduced my own DNA
into the negative control.

244
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:38,451
[Gahn] Did that have any impact
on your interpretation of your results?

245
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:47,651
It did not have any impact as far as
the profile from the evidence sample.

246
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:53,451
It's just the fact that I introduced
my own DNA into the manipulation control.

247
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:58,617
And how do you think your DNA profile
got into that control?

248
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:01,117
I believe my DNA profile
was introduced

249
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:04,818
during the extraction procedure
when I was talking.

250
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,317
I was training two newer analysts,

251
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:11,451
so I was explaining to them
what I was doing as I was setting it up.

252
00:18:11,517 --> 00:18:15,784
And apparently... I felt as if I was
far enough away from my work bench

253
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:20,083
not to introduce my DNA,
but apparently I was incorrect.

254
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,918
[female reporter] That manipulation
control is designed

255
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:23,784
- to catch a mistake that was made.
- Correct.

256
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:27,050
So does that mean though that
a mistake couldn't have been made

257
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:28,584
with the fragment itself?

258
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:31,584
- That's what I'm... That's my question.
- No. No...

259
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:33,317
- The testing...
- I mean, are you...

260
00:18:33,384 --> 00:18:35,451
- Do you feel you cleared that up then?
- Yes.

261
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:39,117
Yes, I think it's clear that the profile
on the bullet was Teresa Halbach's.

262
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,117
And the fact there was the contamination

263
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:45,384
and Sherry Culhane's DNA profile
was in the control

264
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:48,617
had nothing to do
with the DNA profile on the bullet.

265
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:51,017
I'm not wording this properly.
I'm sorry.

266
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:55,617
I mean, that Teresa's DNA couldn't have
somehow just gotten swabbed on there

267
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:57,184
in the lab.

268
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,784
Do you do understand what I'm saying?
On the fragment.

269
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:03,884
- You know, that that mistake made...
- No. No, that mistake was not made.

270
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,350
I know what you're saying.
That mistake was not made.

271
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:10,317
When we argued, by the way, in last March
and filed a motion and said,

272
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:13,017
"We want fair forensic testing.

273
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:17,217
All we want is someone to be there
to observe this." They opposed it.

274
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:19,684
They said, "No. We don't want anybody on...

275
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:22,317
Oh, there's so much more potential
for contamination."

276
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:23,751
That's what they said.

277
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:26,451
That our person being there
would be more risk of contamination

278
00:19:26,517 --> 00:19:29,250
when she's contaminated it herself.

279
00:19:29,317 --> 00:19:32,150
And used it all up
so that we can't retest it.

280
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:35,551
You know, that's a concern.

281
00:19:35,617 --> 00:19:38,117
Jerry, let me get this straight.
So you're saying that Halbach's DNA

282
00:19:38,184 --> 00:19:39,717
may have wound up on this bullet test

283
00:19:39,784 --> 00:19:43,751
because the DNA may have
already been in a test tube?

284
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:50,017
The DNA... is so sensitive
that these contamination logs prove

285
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:55,017
that they get contamination from cases
that aren't even in front of 'em.

286
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:58,551
Cases that are put away,
locked up, done with,

287
00:19:58,617 --> 00:20:01,184
lo and behold, all of a sudden, bingo...

288
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:05,417
they get someone else's profile.

289
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:07,017
Where does that come from?

290
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,884
They don't know.

291
00:20:09,617 --> 00:20:13,184
Where did her DNA come from
in that contaminated control?

292
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,350
She doesn't know.

293
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:18,050
First she says "talking."
Then she says "handling."

294
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,117
They don't really know.

295
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,950
All they know is she's the source,
but they don't know how it got there.

296
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:24,284
And that's the same thing...
If you go through these logs,

297
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,584
you'll see how many times
these errors come up

298
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:31,451
and they really can't tell you
how it got on there.

299
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:34,384
So in other words, if you don't know
where Culhane's DNA came from,

300
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:36,617
you might not know
where Halbach's DNA came from.

301
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:41,384
[Buting] That's right. Remember now, this
bullet wasn't even found in November.

302
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:44,950
This bullet was found under
suspicious circumstances to begin with.

303
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:50,417
So she's testing it four months
after all the other...

304
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:52,717
after she does all these other tests.

305
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,784
For some reason she still has the evidence
from those other tests.

306
00:20:56,884 --> 00:21:00,150
At her desk. At her bench.

307
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,451
I'm showing you exhibit 341.

308
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:10,818
Does that look, uh...
Does that form look familiar to you?

309
00:21:10,884 --> 00:21:12,017
Yes.

310
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,651
This is something that's called
a case communication record.

311
00:21:14,717 --> 00:21:16,384
- Yes.
- And what you do is

312
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,950
when you get a phone call from somebody,

313
00:21:19,017 --> 00:21:22,784
you'll be jotting notes
as to the gist of the conversation?

314
00:21:22,851 --> 00:21:25,250
- That's correct.
- And did you do that in this case?

315
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,150
- Yes.
- Is that your initials at the top?

316
00:21:27,217 --> 00:21:28,950
- Yes.
- All right.

317
00:21:30,717 --> 00:21:34,551
Let me put this up on the Elmo, if I may.

318
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:40,551
This is one of those phone messages
that you got from,

319
00:21:40,617 --> 00:21:43,751
- in this case, Mr. Fassbender. Correct?
- Yes.

320
00:21:43,818 --> 00:21:45,684
And he says there's gonna
be a couple of items

321
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:48,317
- from the house and the garage, right?
- Right.

322
00:21:48,384 --> 00:21:51,184
And then he says, or you wrote down,

323
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,784
"Try to put her in his house or garage."
Correct?

324
00:21:55,851 --> 00:21:57,284
Correct.

325
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,451
So you're being told
before you do any of these tests

326
00:22:00,517 --> 00:22:04,517
that Mr. Fassbender
wants you to come up with results

327
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:10,684
that put Teresa Halbach in Mr. Avery's
house or garage. Isn't that right?

328
00:22:12,484 --> 00:22:17,017
I had that information, but that
had no bearing on my analysis at all.

329
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,384
Of course not.
But that's what you're being told to do.

330
00:22:20,451 --> 00:22:23,184
That was information in the investigation.

331
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,484
That's what Mr. Fassbender told you

332
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:30,851
he hoped you would be able to do
with your tests. Isn't that right?

333
00:22:30,918 --> 00:22:34,150
- Yeah, I assume so.
- OK.

334
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:38,584
Let's go to the bullet for a minute
just to clear up a couple of things.

335
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:41,551
To the eye,
you didn't see any blood visible.

336
00:22:41,617 --> 00:22:42,884
- Correct.
- So you can't really say

337
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:48,050
whether the DNA on that bullet came
from blood or some other source, can you?

338
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,717
All I can say was that
it was nucleated cells.

339
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:53,950
Which could mean blood
or any other source.

340
00:22:54,017 --> 00:22:55,451
Right.

341
00:22:55,517 --> 00:22:58,050
All right, now your lab's protocol,

342
00:22:58,117 --> 00:23:02,017
it recognizes that there may be some
contamination in these tests. Right?

343
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,184
Yes.

344
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,851
And it tells you that
if you go through these tests

345
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:10,050
and the manipulation control
is contaminated,

346
00:23:10,117 --> 00:23:14,384
that you are to report it as inconclusive
for match purposes.

347
00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:15,983
Correct.

348
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,983
Now here,
you ran this test on the bullet...

349
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:25,918
and you got a result that showed the
manipulation control was contaminated.

350
00:23:25,983 --> 00:23:27,751
- Right?
- Correct.

351
00:23:28,484 --> 00:23:30,417
And according to protocol,

352
00:23:30,484 --> 00:23:35,717
you should've not said that that
was Teresa Halbach's DNA on the bullet.

353
00:23:35,784 --> 00:23:39,217
Your protocol told you that
you were to report it as inconclusive.

354
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,818
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

355
00:23:41,884 --> 00:23:43,484
And if that happens,
usually what you do

356
00:23:43,551 --> 00:23:46,584
is you try and re-extract
and run it again.

357
00:23:46,651 --> 00:23:50,751
- Yes.
- But in this case, it was a one-time deal.

358
00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:54,417
You put that bullet into a buffer
and you took whatever sample there was

359
00:23:54,484 --> 00:23:56,751
- and you ran it all.
- Yes.

360
00:23:56,818 --> 00:23:59,784
- So you could not redo the test.
- That's correct.

361
00:23:59,851 --> 00:24:04,551
And if the test came back inconclusive...

362
00:24:07,818 --> 00:24:14,350
you would not be able to put Teresa
Halbach in Mr. Avery's garage at any time.

363
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:17,918
Right? Like Mr. Fassbender asked.

364
00:24:20,884 --> 00:24:24,584
- There were reasons why...
- I'll get to that.

365
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:25,918
My point is this:

366
00:24:26,918 --> 00:24:31,484
this is the only time
in your entire career

367
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:35,818
you have ever filed
a deviation of protocol

368
00:24:35,884 --> 00:24:39,384
so that you could make a call
and include somebody, isn't it?

369
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:44,884
The deviation that I requested
was appropriate for this situation.

370
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,384
- It was OK'd and it was reported.
- But, ma'am...

371
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:54,584
you did not disclose in that report,

372
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:56,083
that official report,

373
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:01,050
that courts and juries and judges
and lawyers and everybody else relies on,

374
00:25:01,117 --> 00:25:04,784
you did not disclose
that in order to make that call,

375
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:08,684
you had to do something so rare,
you've never done it before, did you?

376
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:10,284
No, I did not.

377
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,050
And you didn't put that in there
because if you did,

378
00:25:13,117 --> 00:25:17,484
you wouldn't be able to satisfy
Mr. Fassbender's request

379
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:20,784
that you put Teresa Halbach
in Steven Avery's garage. Right?

380
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:22,384
That's not correct.

381
00:25:23,818 --> 00:25:26,551
Well, let's close with this:

382
00:25:27,217 --> 00:25:31,117
other than that bullet,
all your other tests,

383
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:35,584
none of them put Teresa Halbach
ever in his garage or his house

384
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:38,417
- or any of his vehicles, right?
- Correct.

385
00:25:38,484 --> 00:25:40,050
Thank you.

386
00:25:42,484 --> 00:25:45,818
If it's not a big deal,
and it's a good sample,

387
00:25:45,884 --> 00:25:48,451
then why is the rule
that you should toss it?

388
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:51,517
Because I think the rule...
Well, I don't think anyone tossed it here.

389
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:54,017
The rule is a...

390
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:57,884
And I think as Sherry stated,
90 percent of the time, 99 percent,

391
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,684
you know, is followed. You need that
guideline. You need that standard.

392
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:06,150
But when you're dealing with
such sensitive, sensitive technology,

393
00:26:06,217 --> 00:26:09,217
you have to allow
an element of common sense

394
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:12,751
and this clearly called for it,
and Sherry made the right call.

395
00:26:12,818 --> 00:26:15,017
Does it happen often? No.

396
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:19,818
And I think that shows the consistency
and how good the scientific community is,

397
00:26:19,884 --> 00:26:23,317
that it's not something
that has to be called upon often.

398
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:27,150
There was no sample left to redo,

399
00:26:27,217 --> 00:26:30,751
and it just had no impact at all

400
00:26:30,818 --> 00:26:36,317
on the interpretation of Teresa Halbach's
DNA profile on that bullet.

401
00:26:36,384 --> 00:26:41,584
I... I know you feel that's clear,
but it's up to the jury, you know,

402
00:26:41,651 --> 00:26:44,684
12 people sitting in that box,
to see whether it's,

403
00:26:44,751 --> 00:26:46,451
whether or not it's clear.

404
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:48,918
- Certainly.
- And we probably all understand that,

405
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:53,017
understand your point,
um, but I mean, does...

406
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:56,484
Do you really think
that played very well with the jury?

407
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:59,651
Sure. I believe so.
I think they can understand it.

408
00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:02,950
I think they're also normal,
common sense people

409
00:27:03,017 --> 00:27:06,884
and they're gonna look back and say,
"Yeah, it makes complete sense."

410
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,517
She knew it was her profile

411
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:12,117
and she knew she was teaching
at the time and talking,

412
00:27:12,184 --> 00:27:13,751
so I mean, it all makes sense.

413
00:27:13,818 --> 00:27:17,584
That's what I'm trying to get across.
If you want to be very rigid

414
00:27:17,651 --> 00:27:19,517
and say the protocol is the protocol

415
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:21,884
and you can never deviate
from this whatsoever,

416
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,417
I don't think most people believe
that's how life operates.

417
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:30,050
That sometimes you do
have to deviate just to make sense.

418
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:40,150
[Steven on phone]<i> Somethin' ain't right.</i>

419
00:27:40,217 --> 00:27:41,417
<i>That's all I know.</i>

420
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:48,517
<i>They checked that property over.</i>

421
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,851
<i>They didn't find nothin'.</i>

422
00:27:54,983 --> 00:27:56,983
<i>That's all I know.</i>

423
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,184
<i>Then they're finding something.</i>

424
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,983
<i>I don't know no more than that.</i>

425
00:28:01,884 --> 00:28:03,717
<i>How can I know any more than that?</i>

426
00:28:13,918 --> 00:28:16,751
You're the captain.
You get the captain's chair.

427
00:28:16,818 --> 00:28:18,884
- [woman] Where's the Morgan?
- [laughter]

428
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,217
[Allan] I say, where is the blood?

429
00:28:24,184 --> 00:28:25,918
Now you cut a deer, uh...

430
00:28:25,983 --> 00:28:27,617
Say you're butchering a deer

431
00:28:27,684 --> 00:28:29,584
- and here's the table.
- [Strang] Yeah.

432
00:28:29,651 --> 00:28:33,651
You're gonna have...
on the floor and all...

433
00:28:33,717 --> 00:28:34,983
- I cut a lot of 'em up.
- Yeah.

434
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,250
[Strang] No, I understand.

435
00:28:36,317 --> 00:28:40,851
There's about five quarts of blood
in the human body and, you know,

436
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:43,983
there's no evidence of that,
but we certainly can argue

437
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:47,983
and we are going to argue
"where is the blood?"

438
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:51,983
Well, Jerry shoots me right now,
something's gonna come out of me.

439
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,384
- [Strang] Maybe yes, maybe no.
- [laughter]

440
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:56,117
Maybe a little bullshit.

441
00:28:56,184 --> 00:28:58,083
[Strang] That's a lot
of bullshit coming out.

442
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,751
- [woman] More ways than one.
- [laughter]

443
00:29:00,818 --> 00:29:02,184
I won't shoot you. Don't worry.

444
00:29:05,784 --> 00:29:07,451
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

445
00:29:09,184 --> 00:29:12,384
High velocity spatter,
you standing over somebody...

446
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:15,017
[imitates gunshot] it goes...

447
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:19,150
- All over and it's tiny, tiny little...
- It's tiny, it's fat, it spreads,

448
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:20,983
it's just gonna, like, cover all the junk.

449
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,584
[Buting] The more cluttered it is,

450
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:26,584
the harder it is going to be
to clean up high velocity spatter.

451
00:29:26,651 --> 00:29:28,684
[Strang] Yeah. I mean,
it's real small droplets.

452
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:31,317
You will not be able
to find every bit of it.

453
00:29:32,517 --> 00:29:35,950
[Buting] Let's talk about some
specific results we haven't heard.

454
00:29:36,017 --> 00:29:38,983
Gonna put on exhibit 237 right now.

455
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,284
See that crack that
sort of runs north-south?

456
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:47,117
Law enforcement actually took a jack
hammer and tore up concrete chunks, right?

457
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:49,384
That was my understanding.

458
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:51,451
[Buting] And they did that
because they thought,

459
00:29:51,517 --> 00:29:54,751
"Well, if the victim
had been killed here,

460
00:29:54,818 --> 00:29:58,551
perhaps her blood would've
soaked into those cracks," right?

461
00:29:58,617 --> 00:30:00,250
I assume so.

462
00:30:00,317 --> 00:30:04,150
Did you find Teresa Halbach's DNA
on any of those swabs?

463
00:30:04,217 --> 00:30:06,017
No, I did not.

464
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:12,484
If somebody had cleaned that garage floor
with bleach before the police came,

465
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:14,884
you would not expect to find any DNA,
would you?

466
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,017
[Culhane] No, I wouldn't.

467
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:20,551
[Buting] But in this case, you did
find DNA. You found Mr. Avery's own DNA.

468
00:30:20,617 --> 00:30:21,851
That's correct.

469
00:30:23,484 --> 00:30:26,617
[Baetz] She was shot a number of times.

470
00:30:26,684 --> 00:30:30,584
There would be massive pools of blood.
It wasn't there.

471
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:35,417
Steven, I don't believe, is capable
of sanitizing that house.

472
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:38,584
Very few evidence technicians

473
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:43,651
would be capable of fully sanitizing
an area like that.

474
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:46,584
And they know what to hide
and how to hide it.

475
00:30:46,651 --> 00:30:49,117
I don't think Steven could do that.

476
00:30:49,184 --> 00:30:51,617
[Buting] You checked
item DD, .22 caliber gun.

477
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,584
- That's a rifle, right?
- [Culhane] Yes.

478
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:56,484
You know that if someone shoots
another human being with a gun

479
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:59,150
that's very close to them,
there may be blowback,

480
00:30:59,217 --> 00:31:01,551
spatter of blood onto that weapon?

481
00:31:02,717 --> 00:31:04,284
I assume that's possible.

482
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,184
Well, that's what you were looking for.

483
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,484
I was simply looking
for blood stains, yes.

484
00:31:08,551 --> 00:31:10,417
- On the barrel.
- Correct.

485
00:31:11,284 --> 00:31:13,184
- And you found none.
- Correct.

486
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,484
You never found any
of Teresa Halbach's DNA

487
00:31:15,551 --> 00:31:18,384
on any kind of mattress
or bedding, did you?

488
00:31:19,684 --> 00:31:21,851
I don't believe I examined
any mattress or bedding.

489
00:31:21,918 --> 00:31:25,651
OK. So none of that
was even sent to you, right?

490
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,184
Correct.

491
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:30,250
You never found any DNA
of Teresa Halbach's

492
00:31:30,317 --> 00:31:33,150
- on any carpet in his house, did you?
- No.

493
00:31:33,217 --> 00:31:36,284
There was a stain that was found
that appeared to be a blood drop

494
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,551
on a bathroom floor. Right?

495
00:31:39,617 --> 00:31:42,017
There were several items
on a bathroom floor.

496
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,851
I don't know which one
you're referring to.

497
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:45,517
Well, let's put 'em all together.

498
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:49,083
All the bathroom items, the floor,
the vanity, the sink,

499
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,717
- you tested all of those?
- Correct.

500
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,250
None of them had Teresa Halbach's
blood on it, did they?

501
00:31:53,317 --> 00:31:54,350
No.

502
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:57,250
You tested many knives
that were sent to you, right?

503
00:31:57,317 --> 00:31:58,717
- Yes.
- I see at least seven

504
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:02,551
- just in the May 8th report. Right?
- Yes.

505
00:32:02,617 --> 00:32:05,918
- No DNA of Teresa Halbach's.
- Correct.

506
00:32:07,117 --> 00:32:08,684
By the way...

507
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:12,950
in all of this evidence
that you've tested, all of it,

508
00:32:13,017 --> 00:32:16,451
did you ever find any DNA

509
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:21,250
of a gentleman named
Brendan Dassey anywhere?

510
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:23,818
- In all of your tests?
- No, I did not.

511
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,117
Not one shred, right?

512
00:32:28,184 --> 00:32:31,317
- No, I did not find his DNA.
- And you had his profile.

513
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:33,217
Yes, I did.

514
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,451
[male reporter] In March of '06,
we heard you in this room

515
00:32:35,517 --> 00:32:39,484
say that you believed Teresa Halbach
was stabbed in Steven Avery's trailer

516
00:32:39,551 --> 00:32:43,117
and we heard versions of Steven Avery's
involvement in this case,

517
00:32:43,184 --> 00:32:45,184
attacking her in the trailer.

518
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:48,384
Um, do you believe...

519
00:32:48,451 --> 00:32:50,884
Do you...
I didn't hear you present evidence

520
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:54,184
as to where exactly you believe
parts of this crime were committed.

521
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,451
[Kratz] Yeah,
and until my closing argument,

522
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:59,117
you're not gonna hear a summary from me

523
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:03,651
as to how I believe
that this entire crime occurred.

524
00:33:03,717 --> 00:33:09,918
And let me also just remind you that
there is another case that is pending

525
00:33:09,983 --> 00:33:12,617
at this time,
the Brendan Dassey case,

526
00:33:12,684 --> 00:33:18,050
which may or may not be something
that's raised in this prosecution.

527
00:33:18,117 --> 00:33:21,150
If it is not,
some of those details you may not hear.

528
00:33:21,217 --> 00:33:25,250
Is that just the nature
of having a circumstantial case? Um...

529
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:27,217
Part of the trick of prosecuting a case

530
00:33:27,284 --> 00:33:29,417
- of that nature?
- I don't necessarily think this is a trick

531
00:33:29,484 --> 00:33:31,417
and I don't necessarily
think it's circumstantial.

532
00:33:31,484 --> 00:33:35,818
We have lots and lots
of scientific evidence in this case

533
00:33:35,884 --> 00:33:39,317
that points to one individual
having committed the crime

534
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,617
and I'm confident that the verdict will...
will speak the truth.

535
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,950
[Buting] Let's see,
we've had 18 days of testimony.

536
00:33:50,017 --> 00:33:54,818
- [Strang] Mm-hm.
- At least 15 or 16 of those days,

537
00:33:54,884 --> 00:33:59,083
we have been able to bring out a theme
of our defense again and again.

538
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,250
And that's remarkable.

539
00:34:00,317 --> 00:34:03,884
But it still all comes down to...

540
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:07,651
a key in his bedroom
on the seventh search,

541
00:34:07,717 --> 00:34:12,083
bones outside of his bedroom when
there's a perfectly good working smelter

542
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,083
that would be a much better place to burn,

543
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:17,184
- blood in the RAV4...
- His.

544
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,784
- His. His blood in the RAV4.
- [Strang laughs]

545
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:23,117
And a contaminated bullet in the garage.

546
00:34:23,184 --> 00:34:24,983
But even there, in describing these,

547
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:29,350
you're already doing some
of the explaining that we've gotta do

548
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,551
and let me put it this way:

549
00:34:31,617 --> 00:34:37,751
if ever someone's bones are found 20 feet
out my bedroom window in my backyard,

550
00:34:37,818 --> 00:34:42,851
- I'm gonna be a worried guy.
- [laughs] Yeah, I would be, too.

551
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,384
There were no entire bones
that were found,

552
00:35:01,451 --> 00:35:08,250
but at least a fragment or more
of almost every bone below the neck

553
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:11,083
was recovered in that burn pit.

554
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,184
[Fallon] Did you find evidence
of any human bone

555
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,017
identified as being collected from a site

556
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:18,350
other than the burn pit
behind the defendant's garage?

557
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:21,184
[Eisenberg] Human bone also was collected

558
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:26,017
from what was designated
"burn barrel number two."

559
00:35:27,384 --> 00:35:30,184
Now, you did offer an opinion

560
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:36,451
that you believe the location
for the primary burning episode

561
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:40,551
was the burn pit behind the defendant's
garage, is that correct?

562
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:42,217
That is correct.

563
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:45,117
[Strang] There was a third site,
was there not?

564
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,184
Yes.

565
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,684
- And this would be the quarry pile.
- Yes, sir.

566
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:54,484
You found in the material
from the quarry pile

567
00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:58,918
two fragments that appeared to you
to be pelvic bone.

568
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,451
[Eisenberg] That's correct.

569
00:36:00,517 --> 00:36:05,184
You suspected them
of being human pelvic bone.

570
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,551
That's correct.

571
00:36:06,617 --> 00:36:13,017
The charring and calcined condition
that you saw was essentially consistent

572
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:16,250
with the charring
and the calcined condition

573
00:36:16,317 --> 00:36:20,851
in the Janda burn barrel
and behind Steven Avery's garage.

574
00:36:20,918 --> 00:36:24,484
- [Eisenberg] That is correct, sir.
- Nowhere did you find evidence

575
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:27,350
that you were looking at bone fragments
from more than one body.

576
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:29,050
That is correct, sir.

577
00:36:29,117 --> 00:36:33,317
So what you conclude
is that by human agency,

578
00:36:33,384 --> 00:36:37,250
bone fragments here were moved.

579
00:36:37,317 --> 00:36:41,584
Some bone fragments identified
as human had been moved.

580
00:36:41,651 --> 00:36:45,684
- That's correct.
- All right. Um...

581
00:36:45,751 --> 00:36:48,751
The vast majority
of the human bone fragments

582
00:36:48,818 --> 00:36:51,384
was found behind Steven Avery's garage.

583
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:53,350
[Eisenberg] That's correct.

584
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:56,684
Why were they inconsistent
with human bone fragments

585
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:59,617
that could've been moved
to that site after burning?

586
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:06,350
I would expect to see some breakage
to some fragments with that transport

587
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:09,217
and I did not see anything like that.

588
00:37:09,284 --> 00:37:16,083
Well, we do know that the very recovery
of burnt bone fragments

589
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,317
from behind Mr. Avery's garage
involved shoveling. Correct?

590
00:37:20,384 --> 00:37:23,350
- That's correct.
- Transport to a sifting screen.

591
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:25,751
- Yes, sir.
- Sifting on the screen.

592
00:37:25,818 --> 00:37:26,818
That's correct.

593
00:37:26,884 --> 00:37:30,017
So you're not able to say
that the bone fragments you found

594
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:34,350
are inconsistent with having been
transported to the burn area

595
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:36,317
and poured out there.

596
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:41,217
Based on the volume of human bone
fragments behind the garage,

597
00:37:41,284 --> 00:37:47,184
I find it highly unlikely that
that was not the primary burn location.

598
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:53,317
All right. But I guess that rests
on an opinion that transport in a barrel

599
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:58,851
or some other container
and being poured out

600
00:37:58,918 --> 00:38:05,117
would've done more damage to those human
bone fragments than shoveling, sifting,

601
00:38:05,184 --> 00:38:08,617
putting into a box and transporting
to Madison would've done?

602
00:38:08,684 --> 00:38:12,751
- I really don't know. I don't know.
- You don't know one way or the other?

603
00:38:12,818 --> 00:38:14,617
That's correct.

604
00:38:14,684 --> 00:38:18,417
And you cannot reasonably rule out

605
00:38:18,484 --> 00:38:22,250
another possible burn site, can you?

606
00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:25,651
Based on the information I have
at hand, I cannot.

607
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:26,818
That's all I have.

608
00:38:33,217 --> 00:38:36,317
[indistinct chatter]

609
00:38:49,684 --> 00:38:55,050
Mr. Ertl, showing you exhibit number 160,
can you identify that, please?

610
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:02,751
It's an email to and from
Tom Fassbender and myself.

611
00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:06,317
All right. And in this email, you state,
"In regards to the burn pit,

612
00:39:06,384 --> 00:39:09,684
our involvement began with a request
to use our sifting equipment.

613
00:39:09,751 --> 00:39:12,250
The scene had obviously
been altered at that point."

614
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:14,117
- Is that right?
- Correct.

615
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:17,017
And then would you go on and read
the next sentence, please?

616
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:20,150
"Had we been working any of these scenes
from start to finish,

617
00:39:20,217 --> 00:39:25,350
there would likely have been
more thorough photo record done by us.

618
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:26,784
However, under the circumstances,

619
00:39:26,851 --> 00:39:28,818
we were merely able
to provide technical assistance

620
00:39:28,884 --> 00:39:31,117
rather than complete scene processing."

621
00:39:31,184 --> 00:39:37,017
OK. More typically, if you're called to
the scene to process potential evidence,

622
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,717
you're able to do so
from start to finish, right?

623
00:39:40,918 --> 00:39:45,384
I'd say in the majority of cases,
when we arrive at the scene...

624
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:51,150
we are given over control
and we take the lead.

625
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:56,451
To your knowledge, did Ms. Fassbender
call a forensic anthropologist

626
00:39:56,517 --> 00:39:59,184
out to the scene of the burn pit?

627
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,551
- Not to my knowledge.
- OK.

628
00:40:03,451 --> 00:40:09,217
And this area, the whole area
that was excavated was about how big?

629
00:40:11,983 --> 00:40:14,950
Probably roughly the size
of this table I'm sitting at.

630
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:17,983
[Buting] And when you'd bring
over a shovel here or there,

631
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:21,918
nobody kept track of where exactly
in that area

632
00:40:21,983 --> 00:40:25,784
any particular suspected bone
may have been, right?

633
00:40:25,851 --> 00:40:31,317
No. Everything that was collected
in this area was placed together in a box.

634
00:40:31,384 --> 00:40:35,651
- This area being that four by five feet...
- This four by five foot ash pile

635
00:40:35,717 --> 00:40:37,717
was placed together in a box.

636
00:40:38,918 --> 00:40:42,150
There was no systematic approach

637
00:40:42,217 --> 00:40:46,551
to the collection of the evidence
at first processing...

638
00:40:46,617 --> 00:40:49,317
uh, from what I saw.

639
00:40:49,384 --> 00:40:52,617
I know there was no grid imposed
at that time

640
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:55,451
during the initial excavation.

641
00:40:55,517 --> 00:41:01,184
Um, I was informed that shovels
were used in order to do that,

642
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:06,851
and it wasn't, shall we say,
a more forensic archaeological approach.

643
00:41:06,918 --> 00:41:10,083
OK, so other than nitpicking,
why does this matter?

644
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,250
Why does it matter?

645
00:41:11,317 --> 00:41:16,384
Well, it matters as far as being able
to tell things about the circumstances

646
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:19,950
surrounding the burn of the body.
Where the body was burned.

647
00:41:20,017 --> 00:41:23,918
Was it moved?
Is this the actual location or not?

648
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:29,050
And based on the recovery method
that was used here,

649
00:41:29,117 --> 00:41:36,050
are you able to offer an opinion about
where these human remains were burned?

650
00:41:36,117 --> 00:41:38,617
- No, I'm not.
- Can you agree

651
00:41:38,684 --> 00:41:41,651
with Dr. Eisenberg's opinion

652
00:41:41,717 --> 00:41:46,717
that probably the area
behind Mr. Avery's garage

653
00:41:46,784 --> 00:41:49,384
was the original burn site?

654
00:41:49,451 --> 00:41:51,751
- No.
- Why not?

655
00:41:51,818 --> 00:41:54,784
I've been involved in cases
where human cremains

656
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:58,551
have been burned in one location
and moved to another location.

657
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:02,317
And in those cases, in fact,

658
00:42:02,384 --> 00:42:07,784
the actual location
where the bones have been moved to,

659
00:42:07,851 --> 00:42:11,884
tends to be the location
where most of the remains are.

660
00:42:13,217 --> 00:42:17,217
[Strang] The dispute is not whether the
bones were moved after they were burned.

661
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:21,950
They were. I don't think any reasonable
person would disagree with that.

662
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:24,818
But, you know, the key issue is

663
00:42:24,884 --> 00:42:28,551
the State says they were burned
behind Steven's place

664
00:42:28,617 --> 00:42:31,317
and then a few of them
were moved from there.

665
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:35,617
We say they most likely
were burned somewhere else.

666
00:42:35,684 --> 00:42:42,017
There were better burn sites
to cremate a body to that condition.

667
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:45,617
And then somebody who knew
the cops would be very interested

668
00:42:45,684 --> 00:42:48,484
in pinning this on Steven,
dumped most of the bones,

669
00:42:48,551 --> 00:42:51,651
probably thought he was
dumping all of the bones

670
00:42:51,717 --> 00:42:55,451
in a pile in Steven's burn area
and then sort of sprink...

671
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:59,451
you know, sprinkled them around in
the grass so there'd be no missing them.

672
00:42:59,517 --> 00:43:01,451
Um...

673
00:43:01,517 --> 00:43:04,784
And then put the burn barrel
back in its place,

674
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:10,517
not knowing that a few of the bones
remained in the muck and ash

675
00:43:10,584 --> 00:43:13,017
in the Janda burn barrel.

676
00:43:16,918 --> 00:43:19,684
[Steven on phone]<i> I try to rack my brain</i>
<i>and think and think,</i>

677
00:43:19,751 --> 00:43:21,717
<i>"Who's doing this to me?"</i>

678
00:43:21,784 --> 00:43:23,284
<i>I can't figure it out.</i>

679
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:27,484
<i>I still come up to a dead end.</i>

680
00:43:30,117 --> 00:43:33,117
<i>Just like the last case,
I couldn't figure it out.</i>

681
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:40,150
I'm not in there.

682
00:43:44,717 --> 00:43:47,150
- [Allan] What time you got?
- [Dolores] Five after.

683
00:43:47,217 --> 00:43:49,050
[Allan] Five after already?

684
00:43:50,284 --> 00:43:53,818
Good thing it ain't an emergency.
[laughs]

685
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:05,884
[Allan] Hey, that's hard on your diabetes.

686
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,417
I don't care.

687
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,818
[door opens]

688
00:44:14,484 --> 00:44:17,551
- [woman] You can go in now.
- OK. Come on.

689
00:44:49,517 --> 00:44:53,918
[man] This is the rear cargo area
of the Toyota RAV4.

690
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:57,384
In this area, there are numerous stains,

691
00:44:57,451 --> 00:45:03,117
and they all are, basically they're
described as contact transfer stains.

692
00:45:03,184 --> 00:45:07,017
[Gahn] Describe these stains that you
observed in this portion of the vehicle.

693
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:10,083
[Stahlke] This stain right here,
this is a...

694
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:16,717
just a classic example of bloody hair
transferring onto an unstained surface.

695
00:45:16,784 --> 00:45:18,818
It is... has enough blood there

696
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:22,751
that it also shows a bit of a flow pattern
off of the bottom of that.

697
00:45:22,818 --> 00:45:28,150
But you can see that it is thicker here
and as the length draws out,

698
00:45:28,217 --> 00:45:29,417
it comes to a point.

699
00:45:29,484 --> 00:45:34,083
This is indicative of bloody hair,
transferring the...

700
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:39,217
blood from those...
from that head hair onto this surface.

701
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:50,784
The blood in the RAV4, frankly, helps us.

702
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:52,384
Her blood.

703
00:45:52,451 --> 00:45:54,717
Helps us a lot.

704
00:45:54,784 --> 00:45:59,417
Because if he killed her in the garage
or killed her in his own house somewhere

705
00:45:59,484 --> 00:46:04,017
or nearby, he doesn't need to use the RAV4
to carry her body over to the burn pit

706
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:06,784
if that's where
you're saying she was burned.

707
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:08,584
The only reason you would
put her body in the car

708
00:46:08,651 --> 00:46:13,150
is if you're gonna take it somewhere
farther than your own backyard burn pit.

709
00:46:13,217 --> 00:46:15,717
[clears throat] And that's
further evidence, we think...

710
00:46:16,751 --> 00:46:21,684
that goes to show
she was not burned where they found her.

711
00:46:21,751 --> 00:46:24,717
That she was... wherever she was killed,

712
00:46:24,784 --> 00:46:30,651
she was thrown in the back of the...
the RAV4 and taken someplace to be burned.

713
00:46:34,617 --> 00:46:36,983
[Kratz] The State will call Scott Tadych
to the stand.

714
00:46:41,851 --> 00:46:46,417
It was the fire that I remembered
most of that day.

715
00:46:46,484 --> 00:46:48,384
[Kratz] All right, let's back up
just a little bit.

716
00:46:48,451 --> 00:46:50,983
Would you tell the jury
what you did that afternoon, please?

717
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,551
That morning I was up at my mother's,
she had surgery.

718
00:46:53,617 --> 00:46:56,517
And then I left her
and I went to the woods hunting.

719
00:46:56,584 --> 00:46:58,884
I went to my trailer,
then I went to the woods hunting.

720
00:46:59,017 --> 00:47:01,651
[Kratz] About what time was it
you got out into the woods?

721
00:47:01,717 --> 00:47:03,384
[Tadych] About 3:00.

722
00:47:04,717 --> 00:47:11,284
On your way to deer hunting,
that would be just before 3:00 p.m.,

723
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:14,517
- did you observe anybody on the roadway?
- Yes, I did.

724
00:47:14,584 --> 00:47:17,551
I saw Bobby Dassey on highway 147.

725
00:47:17,617 --> 00:47:20,784
I was going west and he was going east.

726
00:47:21,651 --> 00:47:25,751
Later that night, did you return
to the Janda property?

727
00:47:25,818 --> 00:47:27,250
- Yes, I did.
- Could you tell the jury

728
00:47:27,317 --> 00:47:29,884
- what you saw at that time, please?
- I saw a big fire.

729
00:47:30,818 --> 00:47:33,184
And can you tell the jury
where you saw the fire, please?

730
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:36,584
- Right there.
- Are you able to estimate

731
00:47:36,651 --> 00:47:42,484
how high or how tall the flames were
as you were watching there about 7:45?

732
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:44,717
They were almost as tall as the garage.

733
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:50,050
- All right. So...
- Eight, ten feet. I don't know.

734
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,617
Ten feet, maybe.
Ten feet tall is what the flames were.

735
00:47:52,684 --> 00:47:54,284
- Big fire.
- It's a big fire.

736
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:55,651
All right.

737
00:47:56,784 --> 00:47:59,684
Did you see Steven Avery
standing next to or near that fire?

738
00:48:00,851 --> 00:48:02,117
Yes, I did.

739
00:48:04,784 --> 00:48:10,617
You remember October 31, 2005 because
you skipped work entirely that day.

740
00:48:10,684 --> 00:48:13,950
I didn't skip work. I took vacation
that day to go to be with my mother.

741
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:20,417
Other than your mother,
who would've seen you on October 31st

742
00:48:20,484 --> 00:48:23,784
before you say Bobby Dassey saw you

743
00:48:23,851 --> 00:48:29,050
as the two of you drive past one another
on highway 147?

744
00:48:29,117 --> 00:48:33,117
Nobody. Just... I went
from the hospital to my trailer.

745
00:48:33,184 --> 00:48:37,818
You get home, you very quickly
get ready to go off deer hunting.

746
00:48:37,884 --> 00:48:39,150
Yes.

747
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:42,184
On your way to hunting
is when you see Bobby Dassey.

748
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,784
Correct.

749
00:48:43,851 --> 00:48:50,484
And you got home from the hospital
at about 3:15 that afternoon,

750
00:48:50,551 --> 00:48:52,484
- you say, to your home?
- No.

751
00:48:52,551 --> 00:48:56,983
I got home from the hospital
between 2:30 and quarter to 3:00.

752
00:48:57,818 --> 00:49:00,950
And that's your recollection today,

753
00:49:01,017 --> 00:49:05,083
oh, 15, 16 months after the events?

754
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,918
- Yes.
- All right.

755
00:49:06,983 --> 00:49:11,651
Do you remember talking to a couple
of law enforcement officers about this

756
00:49:11,717 --> 00:49:17,083
back on, uh... November 29, 2005?

757
00:49:18,551 --> 00:49:19,818
Yes.

758
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:23,317
And do you remember
what you told them then

759
00:49:23,384 --> 00:49:27,284
about when you got home from the hospital?

760
00:49:28,918 --> 00:49:30,350
No, I don't recall.

761
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:32,851
I'll show you exhibit 356,

762
00:49:32,918 --> 00:49:37,184
which is a Division of Criminal
Investigation report.

763
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:40,050
The second paragraph
may be the most helpful,

764
00:49:40,117 --> 00:49:44,284
which you're welcome to read to yourself,
any or all of that report.

765
00:49:48,784 --> 00:49:52,617
- Did that help refresh your recollection?
- Yeah, it did.

766
00:49:53,517 --> 00:49:58,517
Did you tell the police on November 29
that you arrived home at 3:15?

767
00:49:58,584 --> 00:49:59,551
I may have.

768
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:03,517
Well, do you remember
telling them that or not?

769
00:50:05,317 --> 00:50:07,950
No, I don't remember telling them that.
It's been such a long time.

770
00:50:08,017 --> 00:50:12,950
Do you think maybe your recollection
back on November 29, 2005,

771
00:50:13,017 --> 00:50:15,083
was maybe a little better
than it is today?

772
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,717
Yeah.

773
00:50:16,784 --> 00:50:20,017
It was just one month after the events
in question at that point.

774
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,050
Right.

775
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:26,317
Was November 29 also the day
that you told the police

776
00:50:26,384 --> 00:50:28,551
that the flames were three feet high?

777
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:31,417
Must have.

778
00:50:32,584 --> 00:50:37,784
And sometime around the time
you talked to Investigator Dedering

779
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:39,717
on the occasion we just described,

780
00:50:39,784 --> 00:50:44,284
were you trying to sell
one of the Dassey boys' .22s

781
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,584
to a man named Jay Mathis at work?

782
00:50:47,551 --> 00:50:49,417
- No.
- You weren't?

783
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:57,684
[Strang] You had,
I think, said that on Halloween

784
00:50:57,751 --> 00:51:00,950
you see Ms. Halbach walking towards
your Uncle Steven's trailer?

785
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:02,217
Yes.

786
00:51:03,851 --> 00:51:08,350
Not too long after that, you leave
the house with your bow to go hunting.

787
00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:09,751
Yes.

788
00:51:09,818 --> 00:51:14,184
As you drove off then to go deer hunting,
it's what, 2:45 or 3:00,

789
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:16,651
- somewhere in that range?
- Yes.

790
00:51:17,651 --> 00:51:20,818
- Anybody see you as you're going hunting?
- Yes.

791
00:51:20,884 --> 00:51:22,751
- Who?
- Scott Tadych.

792
00:51:22,818 --> 00:51:24,184
- Scott Tadych?
- Yes.

793
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,851
OK. What you told Investigator Dedering

794
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:31,751
is that Mr. Tadych would be able to verify
precisely what time he had seen you?

795
00:51:31,818 --> 00:51:33,751
- Yes.
- Why did you think that?

796
00:51:33,818 --> 00:51:36,551
Maybe he looked at his clock in his truck.

797
00:51:36,617 --> 00:51:39,451
Had you talked with Mr. Tadych
about whether he could

798
00:51:39,517 --> 00:51:42,317
- verify precisely when he saw you?
- No.

799
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:47,551
You were just hoping or guessing
that maybe he could?

800
00:51:47,617 --> 00:51:49,184
Yes.

801
00:51:51,117 --> 00:51:55,484
We had two people
who alibied only themselves.

802
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:56,918
They alibied each other.

803
00:51:56,983 --> 00:52:01,083
Nobody else saw them
during this critical time period.

804
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:04,851
They were on the property,
they had access, they...

805
00:52:04,918 --> 00:52:11,150
One of them was directly contradicted
by an independent witness...

806
00:52:11,217 --> 00:52:17,384
um... as to the critical time
of when she was supposedly last seen.

807
00:52:17,451 --> 00:52:21,918
What time did you find that
you got to the end of Avery Road

808
00:52:21,983 --> 00:52:23,717
where you would drop the Dassey boys off?

809
00:52:24,551 --> 00:52:28,784
Um, between 3:30 and 4:00... Or 3:40.

810
00:52:28,851 --> 00:52:31,184
- Between 3:30 and 3:40?
- Yes.

811
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,317
And how do you know that?

812
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:38,150
'Cause it was about the same time
every day. Same route.

813
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:40,083
OK.

814
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:45,617
During the week that began on Monday,
October 31, 2005,

815
00:52:45,684 --> 00:52:52,017
do you remember seeing anything that,
you know, you remembered later

816
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:55,918
when you dropped the Dassey boys off
Monday that week?

817
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:01,083
I, um, remember seeing a woman
taking photographs.

818
00:53:02,684 --> 00:53:05,017
Could you tell what the woman
was taking photographs of?

819
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:06,384
A van.

820
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:10,184
OK, so and again, that would've been
about when? What time of day?

821
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:13,983
3:30. I'm sorry, 3:30 to 3:40.

822
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:15,584
That's all I have. Thank you.

823
00:53:16,184 --> 00:53:19,050
And I assume you're trying to sort of
poke holes in the State's timeline,

824
00:53:19,117 --> 00:53:20,451
is that what that was all about?

825
00:53:20,517 --> 00:53:24,451
[Strang] The implicit premise in your
question is that the State has a timeline

826
00:53:24,517 --> 00:53:25,983
and we're sitting poking holes.

827
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:30,250
I think this is the most reliable person
to offer a timeline.

828
00:53:30,317 --> 00:53:33,017
She is not connected
to any of the parties.

829
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:37,784
She, as a matter of employment,
had a very good reason

830
00:53:37,851 --> 00:53:42,083
to know what the time was
within about a ten minute window.

831
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:44,751
And I'm surprised that it's the Defense

832
00:53:44,818 --> 00:53:50,083
who had to call this witness
to try to establish

833
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:52,317
a reliable idea about time.

834
00:53:52,384 --> 00:53:54,818
[Buting] Except that the time
doesn't fit with their theory.

835
00:53:54,884 --> 00:53:57,284
- That's the problem.
- Well, that's kind of what I'm getting at.

836
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:00,851
The time doesn't fit
with their Brendan Dassey theory.

837
00:54:00,918 --> 00:54:03,517
I don't know that they've actually said
when this all happened.

838
00:54:03,584 --> 00:54:07,384
They did say during the whole Dassey,
you know, scenario

839
00:54:07,451 --> 00:54:11,484
that he got off the bus, he got the mail,
rode over and could hear the screams.

840
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:14,217
And this really is a problem for that.

841
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:19,184
[Strang] Bobby Dassey testified here
that at about 2:45 in the afternoon,

842
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:22,784
he sees the female photographer
out the window

843
00:54:22,851 --> 00:54:26,717
and she appears to be taking photographs.

844
00:54:26,784 --> 00:54:30,517
And then sees her walking towards
Mr. Avery's trailer.

845
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:34,184
Takes a shower,
doesn't see her afterward.

846
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:38,584
How does this help Steve Avery? I mean...
So if what this defense said...

847
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:41,584
I mean, what the prosecution
says happened, happened an hour later?

848
00:54:41,651 --> 00:54:43,551
I mean, I...
That's kind of what I'm getting at.

849
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:45,517
Standing alone outside
the Brendan Dassey house...

850
00:54:45,584 --> 00:54:47,950
[Buting] Listen to the argument
that Mr. Kratz made

851
00:54:48,017 --> 00:54:52,684
on why he thinks that charge of
false imprisonment shouldn't be dismissed.

852
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:55,350
What was it based primarily on?

853
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:58,184
One witness. Bobby Dassey.

854
00:55:00,484 --> 00:55:03,784
This witness today,
with no interest whatsoever,

855
00:55:03,851 --> 00:55:08,517
has a completely different timeline
that would not fit Mr. Dassey.

856
00:55:17,584 --> 00:55:19,284
[Steven on phone]
<i>The evidence don't make no sense.</i>

857
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:22,617
<i>The State ain't gotta prove nothin'.</i>

858
00:55:24,384 --> 00:55:26,818
<i>A innocent person
always gotta prove his self.</i>

859
00:55:27,717 --> 00:55:31,050
<i>And how do you prove the
Sheriff's Department's doing something?</i>

860
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:35,083
<i>I got a hunch that's gonna be hard to do.</i>

861
00:55:38,818 --> 00:55:44,184
[Strang] No sane lawyer looks forward
to presenting an argument to a jury

862
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,350
that the police framed his client.

863
00:55:46,417 --> 00:55:49,517
No sane lawyer
looks forward to doing that.

864
00:55:49,584 --> 00:55:53,684
You know, the police... many people,
outside of large cities, at least,

865
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:56,050
are raised to believe are the good guys.

866
00:55:56,117 --> 00:56:02,684
And for many Americans,
their experiences with the police

867
00:56:02,751 --> 00:56:06,918
essentially confirm the idea
that the police are the good guys.

868
00:56:07,851 --> 00:56:14,451
So when you... When you confront the...

869
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:20,851
the need to present a defense
that your client was framed and worse yet,

870
00:56:20,918 --> 00:56:25,884
framed by law enforcement officers,
you're not happy.

871
00:56:25,918 --> 00:56:27,950
The doorway where he comes out...

872
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:29,417
[Buting] One of the things
that the State argued

873
00:56:29,484 --> 00:56:34,384
was that it would've taken
a wide ranging conspiracy

874
00:56:34,451 --> 00:56:36,484
of so many people to pull this off

875
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:39,983
and that there's just no way
this could be possible.

876
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:41,851
But in fact, that's not true.

877
00:56:41,918 --> 00:56:45,684
Really, two people could've
done this easily enough

878
00:56:45,751 --> 00:56:47,651
if they had the motive to do it.

879
00:56:47,717 --> 00:56:49,217
Maybe one, even.

880
00:56:50,317 --> 00:56:53,184
And the whole argument,
"Well, why would they risk doing this

881
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,083
and risk getting caught?"

882
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:57,284
You have to understand,

883
00:56:57,350 --> 00:57:03,017
they probably would have no fear
of ever being caught doing this.

884
00:57:04,284 --> 00:57:08,417
You know? Who better than a police officer
would know how to frame somebody?

885
00:57:09,184 --> 00:57:11,784
[bailiff] Please raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony

886
00:57:11,851 --> 00:57:13,983
you shall give in the matter
now before the court be the truth,

887
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:16,184
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

888
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,884
- I do.
- Please be seated.

Please state your name
and spell your last name for the record.
