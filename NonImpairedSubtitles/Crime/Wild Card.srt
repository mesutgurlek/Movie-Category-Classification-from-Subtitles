958

TO SEE DEMARCO. I HAVE TO FIND THE TRUTH.

959
01:10:20,673 --> 01:10:23,425
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU MEAN I'M ON TRIAL?

960
01:10:23,426 --> 01:10:28,426
FOR YOUR LIFE, I SHOULD IMAGINE.

961
01:11:12,708 --> 01:11:14,309
DEMARCO: WHY DO I HAVE TO TELL IT AGAIN?

962
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:18,647
I TOLD YOU. YOU BELIEVE ME. SO WHY?

963
01:11:18,648 --> 01:11:22,651
BECAUSE, DANIEL,
YOU ARE ASKING ME TO KILL NICHOLAS HERE.

964
01:11:22,652 --> 01:11:24,819
AND IF A MISTAKE WAS LATER DISCOVERED,

965
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:26,738
I WOULD FEEL SIMPLY DREADFUL.

966
01:11:26,739 --> 01:11:31,739
SO PLEASE, BE AS BRIEF AS YOU WILL.

967

I FEEL GUILTY BECAUSE I LET HIM IN.

968

WHEN THE KNOCK CAME ON THE DOOR, I...

969
01:11:37,249 --> 01:11:40,752
I WASN'T THINKING AND I OPENED IT.

970
01:11:40,753 --> 01:11:42,754
AND RIGHT AWAY HE PISTOL WHIPS ME,

971
01:11:42,755 --> 01:11:44,381
RIGHT IN THE MOUTH, YOU SEE? RIGHT THERE.

- MMM-HMM. YES.
- RIGHT THERE.

973

- YEAH.
- AND HE'S QUICK.

974
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:50,470
HE TAKES OUT TIEL AND KINLAW
LIKE THEY WERE NOTHING.

975
01:11:50,471 --> 01:11:51,846
AND HE TIES THEM UP BACK TO BACK,

976
01:11:51,847 --> 01:11:53,848
THE WAY THEY WERE WHEN YOU FOUND 'EM.

977
01:11:53,849 --> 01:11:58,849
AND THEN HE RIFLES MY DESK,
HE TAKES THE 50 AND

978
01:11:59,855 --> 01:12:03,692
FOR NO FUCKING REASON HE GOES CRAZY

979
01:12:03,693 --> 01:12:08,693
AND HE SHOOTS MAYBE MY TWO BEST FRIENDS
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

980
01:12:09,949 --> 01:12:10,449
WHY?

981
01:12:14,286 --> 01:12:18,039
PROBABLY HE'S PISSED
THAT THERE WASN'T MORE CASH.

982
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,041
AND PROBABLY HE WOULD'VE KILLED ME, TOO,

983

BUT THERE WAS A NOISE OUT IN THE HALL

984
01:12:22,044 --> 01:12:25,088

AND I SUGGEST YOU BEGIN RIGHT NOW.

996
01:12:54,243 --> 01:12:56,703
I'LL ASK JUST TWO QUESTIONS, BABY.

997

IF YOU'RE GONNA ANSWER THEM
TO YOUR SATISFACTION, DO WHAT YOU WILL.

998
01:13:01,417 --> 01:13:03,084
FIRST, WHY WOULD I USE A GUN?

WHY DOES ANYBODY USE A GUN?

1001

NICHOLAS NEVER DOES.

1002

1003
01:13:13,596 --> 01:13:15,597
HE COULD KILL YOU WITH THIS

1004
01:13:15,598 --> 01:13:19,017
FROM FIVE FEET OR 15.

1005
01:13:19,018 --> 01:13:21,227
AND THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS THIS.

1006
01:13:21,228 --> 01:13:22,771
IT'S THE PERFECT COVER.

1007
01:13:22,772 --> 01:13:25,440

THAT NICK WILD NEEDED A GUN

1008

TO COMMIT A ROBBERY.

1009
01:13:28,527 --> 01:13:31,112
ALL RIGHT, NICHOLAS. SECOND QUESTION.

1010
01:13:31,113 --> 01:13:36,113
SECOND AND LAST.

1011

OBVIOUSLY NOTHING.

1014
01:13:43,209 --> 01:13:45,835
WELL, THEN, THERE'S MY SECOND QUESTION.

1015
01:13:45,836 --> 01:13:49,672
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT I KNOW THAT MR. DEMARCO HERE
