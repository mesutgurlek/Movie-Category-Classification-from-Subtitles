1
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,667
You have the phone?

2
00:02:58,244 --> 00:02:58,243
<i> Should I do it now?</i>

3
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:02,781
<i> Not yet. Wait until</i>
<i> we get to the checkpoint.</i>

4
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,249
Okay, guys, this is it.

5
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,652
Hey, Ivy league's gun,
put that gun back away.

6
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:09,354
- What are you talking about?
- I don't need some egghead

7
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,757
who just scored an 81 on his
qual shooting my dick off, okay?

8
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,192
This is my fucking guy!

9
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,593
I'm not just gonna
sit here while you--

10
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:19,464
guys, enough! Nate,
just follow our lead, okay?

11
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,350
Is your heart clear?

12
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:41,220
<i> Are you sure</i>
<i> you want to do this?</i>

13
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,760
The signal
will be better outside.

14
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,339
Here it is.

15
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,561
Did it work?

16
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,597
- Drop it!
- Freeze!

17
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,700
- Hands in the air!
- Turn around!

18
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,836
You have the right
to remain silent.

19
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:34,473
Anything you say can
and will be used against you
in a court of law.

20
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:37,009
You have the right
to an attorney.

21
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,746
<i> Hello, usman. I can help you.</i>

22
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:44,750
<i> I can get you phone calls with</i>
<i> your parents, your friends...</i>

23
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:47,586
<i> My parents?!</i>
<i> I wish they were dead!</i>

24
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:48,787
<i> And I don't have any friends.</i>

25
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,556
Oh, wow, he's a real prince,
this one.

26
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,426
Can I get in there?

27
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,397
Salam aleikum.

28
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,710
What the fuck, tom?
I have this room at 4:00!

29
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,445
I know you don't get a lot
of news downstairs, zamparo,

30
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,814
but we just broke up a massive
terrorist plot, all right?

31
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:16,982
Try and keep up.

32
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,934
Um...

33
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,569
What? What is it?

34
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,571
Sir, when I flagged up
this guy's email,

35
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,640
I thought the investigation
was only gonna proceed

36
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,742
if there was substantive
criminal evidence to back it up.

37
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,846
We've got hours of him
talking about waging jihad
and killing children.

38
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:58,950
Right, but talking, though, sir,
not... he's not doing anything.

39
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,852
Isn't that the point?

40
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,765
Hey, Tim. How's it going?

41
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:17,702
You celebrating something, Nate?
You seeing someone special, huh?

42
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:23,575
Uh, yeah, actually.
How'd you guess?

43
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,936
Genius, emergency meeting

44
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:52,170
in the conference room!

45
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,777
The crash was off 301
around 2:00 last night.

46
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,846
Local police
controlled the scene,

47
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:03,648
so, thankfully,
the press knows nothing.

48
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,852
These containers
carried cesium-137.

49
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:10,622
It's used for radiotherapy
applications in hospitals,

50
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:14,926
but it's highly regulated
and had no business
being on that truck.

51
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,529
When we tracked the shipment
back to Baltimore,

52
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:20,866
the customs record showed
eight containers, not two.

53
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:25,203
So there's six more of them
out there, all of them
in the country illegally.

54
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:28,840
If that quantity made it's way
into a radiological device,

55
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,042
we could be looking at
thousands of casualties,

56
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:37,115
mass evacuations
and radioactive contamination
throughout the D.C. area.

57
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,817
- Tom?
- Yeah.

58
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:42,721
Uh, lab analysis puts the
cesium coming from north Africa.

59
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:45,056
So the guys on four,
they put together this map.

60
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:48,827
It's an analysis
of Muslim communities in DC,
Maryland and Virginia,

61
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,729
along with their
countries of origin.

62
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,898
We'd like each-- yes?

63
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,866
What about leads
on the dt front?

64
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,636
Well, given the cesium
came from north Africa,

65
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,838
we don't think domestic
is really in the picture.

66
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,708
The last time anyone
tried to build a dirty bomb
on us soil was James cummings.

67
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,911
He was a white supremacist
living in Maine,

68
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,980
he was going to set it off
at Obama's inauguration.

69
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:13,685
He had uranium, thorium, and he
was trying to acquire cesium.

70
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,620
I'm sure you're familiar
with the case.

71
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,889
It goes without saying,
anyone here is welcome

72
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,625
to pursue any leads
they think are fruitful.

73
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,974
Okay, would you fucking stop--

74
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,176
- oh, I'm so sorry.
- Hi.

75
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,878
- Hi.
- I'm Angela zamparo.

76
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,246
- Nate foster.
- I know.

77
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,181
You got a couple minutes?

78
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:47,152
Dt's downstairs.

79
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:50,188
There's only one perk
to being down in this shithole.

80
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,894
Nicorette just isn't the same.

81
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:59,898
So, Nate...
You seem like you've got

82
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,100
a bit more going on
than most around here.

83
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,004
You remember Oklahoma city?

84
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:09,674
Well, yeah,
i guess I was five, but sure.

85
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,011
What do you know
about Timothy McVeigh?

86
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:18,617
Ah... he was some kind of
lone extremist...

87
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:19,918
...in a militia?

88
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,687
Don't be an asshole
who bullshits questions

89
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,122
you don't know
the answer to. Here.

90
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,726
Timothy McVeigh was a
decorated Gulf war veteran.

91
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:31,830
He was not insane;
He was not a lunatic;
And he was not stupid.

92
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:35,100
He was a white supremacist,
following a plan.

93
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:39,137
- What plan?
- A plan from a book
called the Turner diaries.

94
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:44,776
It's about a "race war"
to exterminate blacks,
Jews, and "mud people."

95
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,412
You know how the war
gets started?

96
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:52,751
The hero drives a truck bomb
into a federal building.

97
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:57,756
Timothy McVeigh
was reenacting that scene
from the Turner diaries.

98
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,225
He was carrying the book
with him when he was arrested.

99
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:03,662
What he was trying to do
was start the race war.

100
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:09,034
You're focused on
the islamic guys. I get it.

101
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:12,437
We all create a narrative based
on what we think is important.

102
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:15,173
We see what we want to see.

103
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,811
But just because you're not
looking at something...

104
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,248
...doesn't mean it's not there.

105
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,887
So, why are you telling me this?

106
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:41,700
<i>I'm talking about a blood</i>
<i> and guts, in the street,</i>
<i> kill or be killed race war.</i>

107
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:46,237
<i> I have information</i>
<i> about a truck accident</i>
<i> outside DC last night,</i>

108
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:50,775
<i> involving classified</i>
<i> radioactive material.</i>

109
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:55,380
<i> But now the FBI is trying</i>
<i> to cover it all up. Why?</i>

110
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,249
<i> Because something</i>
<i> big is happening,</i>

111
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:02,220
<i> and it's bigger than 9/11,</i>
<i> and it's bigger than</i>
<i> Oklahoma city.</i>

112
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:07,058
<i> So be warned,</i>
<i> be armed, and be ready.</i>

113
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,302
His name is Dallas wolf.

114
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,037
He gets 20,000
listeners a night.

115
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,439
We believe he's based
just outside of DC,

116
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,309
but almost nobody
knows him personally.

117
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:27,846
But I have an informant,
a skinhead in a gang.

118
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:30,381
And the leader of that gang
is friends with wolf.

119
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:34,953
So I need someone to get
in there, and get close to him.

120
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:39,524
Right and I'm trying to tell you
that this is not my thing!

121
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:42,227
I barely passed the pft!

122
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,329
What do you think
undercover work is?

123
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,231
Beating guys up
and shooting at them?

124
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:50,802
No, it's people skills.
It's controlling situations.

125
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:53,438
- It's this.
- Seriously?

126
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,274
This is the only undercover
training you'll ever need.

127
00:12:56,276 --> 00:13:00,311
I saw you with that Muslim kid.
You got most of this
going on anyway.

128
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:04,215
Look, I read your file.
High IQ, great people skills,

129
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:07,886
but not your typical
FBI profile.

130
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:15,460
Introverted, an outsider,
unhappy childhood.

131
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,062
Single mother,
always moving around a lot,

132
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,064
always the new kid,
bullied at school,

133
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,232
no close friends or--

134
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,001
okay, okay, okay, fuck you!

135
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,135
That's... this is an invasion.

136
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,436
What gives
you the right to look--

137
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,305
because we don't have time
to dick around here!

138
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,507
You don't smuggle a boatload
of cesium into the country

139
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:30,575
and then just
let it fucking sit there!

140
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:31,876
Fine, but I'm trying
to tell you,

141
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:32,944
I don't have
the skills for this!

142
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,145
I can't even defend myself!

143
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,380
You do have the skills,

144
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:37,348
and they mean you will
never have to!

145
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,452
What did you say to that kid?

146
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:47,559
"You want to change things,
so nobody has to suffer
the way you did."

147
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,472
<i> A dirty bomb</i>
<i> is any kind of crude,</i>

148
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:04,142
<i> explosive device</i>
<i> that when detonated,</i>

149
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:07,879
<i> disperses radiation</i>
<i> around and beyond the blast.</i>

150
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:11,449
<i> What you would do</i>
<i>is irradiate a large territory.</i>

151
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,853
<i> Now some of these things</i>
<i> have a half-life of 30 years.</i>

152

<i> In many cases,</i>

153
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:20,124

<i> cannot be felt,</i>
<i> cannot be tasted.</i>

154
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:22,427
<i> The more technically</i>

155
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,096

158

Do you know how management
looks at undercover, Nate?

164
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,528
You think this office is bad?

165
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,930
They'll have you

167
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,432
I just want to discuss
the option, sir.

168
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,934
Discuss the option?

169
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:05,336
Of what,
of killing your whole career?

170
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,608
<i> In the beginning was the word.</i>

171
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,212
<i> When the word found us,</i>
<i> we were unconscious.</i>

172
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:19,250
<i> But the word awakened us.</i>

173
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,519
<i> It made us conscious.</i>

174
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,423
<i> Our enemies were everywhere.</i>

175
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,460
<i> Our eyes were opened.</i>

176
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:33,097
<i> And they were</i>
<i> filled with shame.</i>

177
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:39,570
<i> We have been violated,</i>
<i> betrayed, and humiliated.</i>

178
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,573
<i> For we had</i>
<i> allowed this to happen.</i>

179
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:48,179
<i> And so the word spoke to us,</i>
<i> and told us to stand up!</i>

180
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:51,983
<i> To take back</i>
<i> what had been stolen from us!</i>

181
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:56,587
<i> To fight for race,</i>
<i> soil, and honor!</i>

182
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,992
<i> Do you know what they do</i>
<i> to informants, Nate?</i>

183

<i> You know what a "necktie" is?</i>

184
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,561
They slit your throat,

185
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,129
and they pull your tongue
right out through it?

186

Oh, shut the fuck up!

187
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,532
Oh, what, so you
want him to go in blind,

188
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:08,666
so he has no idea
what he's getting into?

189
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,001
You're just trying
to manipulate him!

190
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,436
And you're not?

191

You do whatever
the fuck you want.

192
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,573

It's my dd-214.

I was up all
night Photoshop-ing it,

Good. Now what else?

228
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,714
<i> Lone extremism</i>

229

<i> is not a social phenomena,</i>
<i> it's a tactic.</i>

<i> Terrorists call it</i>
<i> leaderless resistance.</i>

<i> The leaders of the movement</i>
<i> provide inspiration,</i>

<i> hidden cells act independently</i>

Arouse in the other person
an eager want.

236
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,676
So what do they want from you?

237
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,912
My loyalty? I'm loyal,
I'm dedicated to the the cause.

Welcome to medvale medical

My military contacts
helped me start this business.

246
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:07,565

materials and hide them.

- That! Under your fucking
shirt there!

263
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,360

Hey, are you a cop?

264

- No, I'm not.
- No? Whoo!

266
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,571
He's fine.

267
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:22,340
Sorry about that, Nate.
But you know how it is.

268
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,475
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Whoa, whoa.

269
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,347
Have a seat.

270
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,625
You drink bud?

271
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,695
Uh, yeah, absolutely.

272
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,997
Frank tells me you were in Iraq.

273
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,734
Uh, yeah,
three years in the corps.

274
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:52,937
- You kill anybody?
- Johnny!

275
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:55,106
He's Johnny. He's a fresh cut.

276
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:57,074
We're trying to
teach him the ropes.

277
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,509
I know the fuckin' ropes, man.

278
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,578
Yeah, then mind your
fucking manners!

279
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,950
So, did you? Kill anybody?

280
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,453
I don't talk about that.

281
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,523
But what I did see

282
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:14,425
was a lot of our guys go down.

283
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:17,828
Good guys... friends.

284
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,930
And for what?

285
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,802
I was on a wmd squad,
the whole reason we were there,

286
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:27,738
except we didn't find shit,
did we?

287
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,041
Hmm. So then I get home,
i started listening
to Dallas wolf.

288
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:34,078
Oh, yeah?
Dallas and I go way back.

289
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,647
Oh, there's a guy
I'd love to meet, you know.

290
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:37,948
He's somebody
who's telling the truth.

291
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,484
He's out there,
he's asking why were we there?

292
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:41,852
And the answer's
always the same.

293
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:43,721
Iraq, 9/11, osama bin laden,

294
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:46,090
what does it all come back to?

295
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,159
Look at every war
we've ever been in.

296
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:50,594
How many white men
slaughtered their brothers
in world war ii?

297
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,963
What, like a 100 million?
And for who?

298
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:55,099
Who's always
pulling the strings?

299
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,868
It's all here in front of us.
But most people are blind.

300
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,474
Look at this bottle.

301
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,143
You see anything funny?

302
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,917
You're talking about
the Jew tax?

303
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:14,685
What's the Jew tax?

304
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:16,887
Tell 'em, Nate.

305
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,824
Start looking at
the food you buy,

306
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:21,525
and you'll see this little "u."

307
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:24,061
The union of orthodox rabbis
gets paid to perform

308
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:26,030
a "blessing" on everything
in the grocery store.

309
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:31,502
For this "blessing," they rake
in billions of dollars in taxes.

310
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:37,041
We can't control the ketchup,
but we can control the streets.

311
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:39,210
That's how
it went down in Germany.

312
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:42,613
And we think of ourselves
as a sturm abteilung.

313
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:45,549
We are
a thinking man's soldiers.

314
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,218
First here.

315
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,887
And then here.

316
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:52,089
And that is where
the revolution starts.

317
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,858
We're not these
tired old kkk guys,

318
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,960
waiting for some catastrophe
to start a race war.

319
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:58,729
- We're the catastrophe.
- That's fucking right.

320
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,770
And we need guys like you,
with military backgrounds.

321
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:09,607
We need best practices
in our security.

322
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:12,510
Come on, man, I think our
fucking security is pretty good.

323
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:15,179
Well, always room
to improve, though, right?

324
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,283
Oh, yeah?

325
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,087
Like what?

326
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:25,956
Well, like, look at
the position of this booth

327
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,692
and then tell me,
without looking,
where the nearest exits are.

328
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,194
- What's your point?
- The point is,

329
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,695
of all the large
booths in this restaurant,

330
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,697
you picked the one
farthest from the exits.

331
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,065
If something goes down,
we're fucked.

332
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,635
No, we're ready
for whatever goes down.

333
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:40,738
Yeah, with only you and him,
i don't know your name yet,
I'm sorry, carrying?

334
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,207
Oh, and how the fuck
you think you know that?

335
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:49,146
When you pat someone down
so they're facing everybody's
lap, it's pretty easy to tell.

336
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,749
You spend three years in Iraq,
you learn how to scan a room.

337
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,083
And see threats.

338
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:56,086
Well,
isn't that fucking impressive.

339
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:58,556
Now I only got
one question for you.

340
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:00,624
What?

341
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:03,260
Why are you wearing levis?

342
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:11,802
Levis? Your fucking Jew jeans?

343
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:13,904
Yeah, no, sorry,
i just couldn't help notice

344
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,205
when I was pattin' you down.

345
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,074
While you were doing
your little detective work

346
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,143
all up in everybody's lap.

347
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,147
So why are you wearing them?

348
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,151
Because when
i got home from Iraq,

349
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:32,723
my brother gave me these
jeans... as a homecoming gift.

350
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:35,025
Now, does he understand
the struggle we're in? No.

351
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:39,196
But I'm sure as shit not gonna
let a zionist conglomerate
keep me from wearing them.

352
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:42,299
You wanna boycott the Jews?

353
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,134
You ever look at
the fortune 500?

354
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:46,136
You'll be living
in a fucking cave.

355
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:04,622
He's right. Shit, they probably
own this place, too.

356
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,750
Frank tells me you run
a medical supply company now?

357
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:35,653
Yeah. Yeah, my military contacts
helped me set up.

358
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:38,088
We're just starting out,
but we got access
to a lot of stuff.

359
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,291
That's great. I'd love to
talk to you about that sometime.

360
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:43,160
Yeah... anytime.

361
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:50,834
You know, when I was 13,
i actually played soccer.

362
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:54,138
One day, I came into
the locker room, right?

363
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,373
And there were these
six niggers,

364
00:27:56,375 --> 00:28:01,679
and they had this
friend of mine, this Irish kid,
down in the stalls, right?

365
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:05,416
His head was
up against the toilet,
and his face was just covered,

366
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:09,386
I mean, covered in blood,
like flaps of skin.

367
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:12,923
I'd never seen anyone
get beaten like that.

368
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,796
And when I came in,
they just stared at me.

369
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,966
They stared, and I...

370
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:31,709
I walked away...
And just left him.

371
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,279
I hated those motherfuckers.

372
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:43,487
Yeah, when I was your age,
i got pushed around a lot.

373
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:46,757
- Yeah?
- It fucking sucks.

374
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:48,392
But you can use that.

375
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:55,099
Yeah, but with these guys,
nobody can do shit to me.

376
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:59,970
I learned to be proud. Strong!

377
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:04,274
- Yeah, but--
- to be an Aryan
fucking warrior!

378
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:05,476
Isn't that right, Johnny?

379
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,812
All right, so what, are we gonna
stand around all night

380
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:11,181
- or we gonna get fucking drunk!
- Let's go!

381
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:14,051
Come on, junior, let's get
some fucking beer, motherfucker!

382
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:16,120
Come on, boy!

383
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:17,921
Get in there, boy!

384
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:25,162
Hey, Nate, you know what, man?

385
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,533
Everybody seems to
really fucking like you.

386
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,170
Yeah.

387
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,790
<i> This is my friend Nate</i>
<i> I was telling you about.</i>

388
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:54,191
<i> Hey, everybody.</i>

389
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:57,394
<i> 14/88, brother.</i>
<i> Good to meet you.</i>

390
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:59,096
<i> All right, spread 'em!</i>

391
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:01,098
<i> Roy does our security.</i>

392
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:06,537
<i>To be an Aryan fucking warrior!</i>

393
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,405
<i> Isn't that right, Johnny?</i>

394
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:16,547
<i> Something big is happening.</i>

395
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,553
<i> In the beginning was the word.</i>

396
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,558
<i> Be armed and be ready.</i>

397
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,415
- Hey!
- Hey.

398
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,083
What's the matter, man?
You didn't hear me?

399
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:55,252
I just... uh...

400
00:30:55,254 --> 00:30:56,587
You sleep well?

401
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,555
What's wrong?

402
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,059
Oh, yeah, no,
we know where you live.

403
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:06,997
- Yup.
- Right. Cool.

404
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,499
Yeah, so, what,
you're not gonna invite us in?

405
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:11,869
Yeah, come on in.

406
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:14,438
Oh, thanks, man,
so sweet of you.

407
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:18,375
It's a mess, sorry.

408
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,545
Welcome.

409
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,114
You mind?

410
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,952
Yeah, it's a cool place, man.

411
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:33,023
Yeah, but it kind of
looks like you just moved in.

412
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:39,363
So, what are
you guys doing here?

413
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,899
Aw, don't break my heart.

414
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,501
What are we doing here?

415
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:47,104
Come on, don't make it sound
like you're not happy to see me.

416
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,575
See Vince is outside. He's got
a little surprise for you.

417
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:55,245
Oh, hey, well, um...

418
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,014
Yeah, well, I'm ready. Let's go.

419
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:59,549
You're gonna be psyched, man!
It's fucking awesome!

420
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:01,084
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

421
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,921
Cool, well, I'm good to go.
Let's head out.

422
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,589
- Let's go, Roy.
- What's the rush?

423
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:09,326
I'm coming.

424
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:15,399
What the fuck?
What the fuck is that?

425
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:35,118
Goddamn, man, you got some
fucking shitty-ass furniture
up in here, huh?

426
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,621
Yep. Cheap as shit.

427
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:40,023
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

428
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:41,391
Sieg heil,
motherfucker, let's go.

429
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,026
Sieg fucking heil.

430
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,169
<i> You didn't</i>
<i> finish your transcript.</i>

431
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:55,205
<i> Yeah, I know, I'll get to it.</i>
<i> Look at my fucking arm!</i>

432
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:56,974
<i> And what the fuck</i>
<i> is going on with this guy Roy?</i>

433
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:59,509
You make him look small,
you make him into an enemy.

434
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:02,746
Sometimes, Angela, it would just
be great to hear, "good job."

435
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,015
I'm only so hard on you

436
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:06,683
because I'm trying
to protect you.

437
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:08,352
You have to remember
your objective here.

438
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:10,487
This is about
getting to Dallas wolf.

439
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,255
So what do I do about that?

440
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:16,426
Try relating to these guys
as human beings. You know?

441
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:18,462
Open up to them, if you can.

442
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:21,698
You may have more in common
with them than you think.

443
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,503
Man, why the fuck does
Vince make us come to this shit?

444
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:29,773
"Good networking,
lots of movement guys."
I mean, who gives a fuck?

445
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,375
Well, is Dallas wolf
gonna be here?

446
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:32,576
Who the fuck knows?

447
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:35,045
I don't listen to that
talk radio bullshit.

448
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,448
Fuck!

449
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,021
Goddamn. Hey, that looks
good on you, man.

450
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,188
Yeah, thanks.

451
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,323
Um, just go in,

452
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:48,492
I got another
shirt in the cargo.

453
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,245
Hi, you must be
Vince's friend Nate!

454
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,647
- I'm Becky, Gerry's wife.
- Oh, hi, nice to meet you.

455
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:13,050
- Such a pleasure to have you.
- Thank you for having me.

456
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:14,384
Yeah, of course.

457
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,387
Hey, Nate,
i made some cupcakes.

458
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:21,558
The frosting is a little
messed up, but they taste good.

459
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,427
<i> So, Dallas, we wanted...</i>

460
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,629
Nate!
Come check this out.

461
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:27,798
<i> Is it true,</i>
<i> this Dallas wolf unity rally</i>

462
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,333
<i> is the largest event</i>
<i> you've hosted in years?</i>

463
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,202
<i> Absolutely.</i>
<i> We've brought together</i>

464
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:35,439
<i> the biggest white separatist</i>
<i>organizations in the northeast.</i>

465
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:37,474
<i> And we're also</i>
<i> having a conference,</i>

466
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:40,444
<i> with some of the world's</i>
<i> preeminent racial scholars.</i>

467
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:42,212
<i> But let me</i>
<i> get something straight.</i>

468
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:44,648
<i> You have all your permits,</i>
<i> you have all your licenses,</i>

469
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,684
<i> and yet this afl,</i>
<i> the anti-fascist league,</i>

470
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,286
<i> John, can we get the graphic?</i>

471
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:51,421
<i> They're planning on</i>
<i> viciously attacking</i>

472
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,824
<i> peaceful demonstrators</i>
<i> with hockey sticks</i>

473
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:56,259
<i> and d batteries</i>
<i> and urine balloons.</i>

474
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,828
<i> Not only that.</i>

475
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:01,832
<i> They're busing in hundreds</i>
<i>of protestors from the DC area.</i>

476
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:05,569
<i> But all I can say is,</i>
<i> the afl better be careful.</i>

477
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,804
<i>Because while we come in peace,</i>

478
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:10,607
<i> we're certainly</i>
<i> not afraid of war.</i>

479
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:11,775
Fuck.

480
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:13,477
Yeah.

481
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:15,612
God, that's the first
I'm hearing about this rally.

482
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,882
I mean, god knows you can't
get any real news on the
yidivision, but still...

483
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:20,617
Are you planning
on going, Nathan?

484
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,620
And this is Andrew Blackwell
from the Aryan alliance.

485
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,756
- Hail victory, brother.
- Hail victory.

486
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:29,693
The Aryan alliance, huh?
I've read a lot about you guys.

487
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:33,430
Well, we're the premiere
white nationalist group in the
world, so that's not surprising.

488
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:36,166
Earnest walton,
grand dragon, good to meet you.

489
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:37,400
Good to meet you.

490
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:38,768
Earnest is with the local klan.

491
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,837
Yeah, you should stop by
one of our meetings.

492
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,572
- We'd love to have you.
- - Oh, wow.

493
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:43,907
You should check out
our website, too.

494
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:45,542
We're always looking for
quality people.

495
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:49,779
Ah, I don't think Nate's
into all that religious stuff.

496
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,383
Excuse me?

497
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,721
Religious stuff?

498
00:35:57,723 --> 00:36:02,192
I just think Nate is a little
more rational than that.

499
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,364
I'm not sure I know
what you mean by that.

500
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,537
Come on, Nate.
Let's go back and get some food.

501
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,410
Stay away from those faggots.

502
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:22,679
They got this fucked up religion
where they think the Bible

503
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:26,516
was written for white men
and aryans are the lost tribes
of Israel.

504
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,218
The Bible.

505
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,353
Jews invented christianity.

506
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,788
Jews invented
the printing press,

507
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,456
and the Bible is the most
published book in the world.

508
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,724
I mean,
anything seem off to you?

509
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:36,193
How about the fact
the romans conquered

510
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,360
every mud race on earth,

511
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:38,495
and then christianity
finished them off

512
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:40,230
in a hundred years?

513
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:44,434
You gotta know who
to stick with in this movement.

514
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:46,336
You're with us.

515
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,472
Goddamn it, Vince,
every time we come here,

516
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:50,840
the whole fuckin' place is dry!

517
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:54,244
- What the fuck, man?
- It's two hours, be good.

518
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:59,382
Gerry, there's somebody I want
you to meet. This is Nate.

519
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,419
- Hey, Gerry Conway.
- Nate Thomas, nice to meet you.

520
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:04,254
Nice to meet you.
Vince told me all about you.

521
00:37:04,256 --> 00:37:07,424
Make yourself at home.
I am throwing on
some veggie burgers.

522
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:08,725
Thanks for having us.

523
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,494
- Hi!
- Hey, hey, I'm Nate.

524
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,597
- Madeline. Nice to meet you.
- Hey, Madeline.

525
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,365
- This is Timmy.
- Hey, Timmy.

526
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:16,866
You want to come
see our tree house?

527
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,668
Uh, yeah, sure,
where are we going?

528
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,538
Oh, right, yeah, there.

529
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,674
Oh, wow, that is great!
Did your dad build this?

530
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,476
- I built it!
- You built this?

531
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:29,279
- But my daddy helped.
- Okay. Wow.

532
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:32,582
- It's to protect us.
- Yeah, from what?

533
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,517
If the mud people come.

534
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:38,822
Always be ready.
Always be watchful
and stick together.

535
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,891
You guys kidnapping my guest?

536
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,960
- Huh? Huh?

537
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:47,664
This is amazing, man.

538
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,467
Well, I've always been
good with my hands.

539
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:55,005
And it was just wonderful
to have a project with the kids.

540
00:37:55,007 --> 00:37:57,507
You know how
you spell love, Nate?

541
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,911
T-i-m-e.

542
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,948
Ninety percent of the time
you'll ever spend with your kids

543
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,784
- comes before the age of 12.
- Wow.

544
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,820
Yeah. You been in the movement
long, Nate?

545
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:14,324
Um, not long. Just since
i got back from Iraq.

546
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:17,360
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, Vince told me you served.

547
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:18,828
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

548
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:24,401
Hey, Nate,
don't take this the wrong way

549
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:26,836
but you kind of seem
a little mature for a skinhead.

550
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,004
Really?

551
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,039
Yeah.

552
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:30,940
Yeah, maybe.

553
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:33,977
I don't know.
Um, what about you?

554
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,845
You seem to know a lot
of people in this movement.

555
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,914
Ah, they probably come
for the free food.

556
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:40,884
Ah, no.
You have these barbecues often?

557
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:43,687
Yeah, as much as I can,
yes, you know,

558
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:47,757
I try to create
a positive environment
for everybody in the community,

559
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:49,726
and a place for us
to come together and be

560
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:51,728
healthy in body and spirit.

561
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,597
"Fuck you, bitch!"
And he turned around,
and he's like--

562
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:59,035
guys! Guys!
Language, please. Kids.

563
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:01,404
Jesus fucking Christ.

564
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:04,007
It makes me so sad
to see those two.

565
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:06,109
They gotta clean up their act.

566
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:09,346
Well, how do you mean?

567
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:14,050
Well, the cigarettes,
and alcohol, the language.

568
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:18,922
This is what's happening
to our young Aryan men.

569
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:20,824
Yeah. To be honest,
now that I met you,

570
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:23,393
I'm kind of surprised
you invited those guys.

571
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:25,028
Well, you can't exclude them.

572
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,431
I mean,
they're the next generation.

573
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:29,966
They need our help.

574
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:33,436
Need to understand their
heritage, and be proud of it.

575
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:36,806
That's what it's all about,
isn't it? The children.

576
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:39,476
What kind of a world
will they grow up in?

577
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:49,452
Goddamn, man, that was the worst
fucking party on earth.

578
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:54,958
Jesus Christ, what kind
of bullshit vodka is this, man?

579
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,727
Man, that's the last time
i ever let you pick it out.

580
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:03,900
Man, look at that shit.

581
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:07,003
Look at that!
That is just fucking...

582
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:09,539
God, that is so fucking awful!

583
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:15,078
Man, look at that,
look at that beautiful
Aryan woman and that fucking...

584
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,414
Roy, come on,
let's go the fuck home.

585
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:20,483
No, no, man, we're gonna
teach these two a lesson.

586
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:23,086
- No!
- Get your fucking hands
off of me!

587
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:27,924
Don't you ever
fucking touch me again.

588
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:32,796
You hear me?
We're Aryan warriors, right?

589
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:37,567
That means we got a
responsibility to do
something about shit like this.

590
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,942
Hey, you two! You need to
get the fuck out of here!

591
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,110
Hold on, what did you say?

592
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,545
I said, get the fuck
out of here

593
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:50,079
or we're gonna kill you,
you fucking spic!

594
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:51,614
What the fuck is your problem?

595
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,982
- What's our problem?
- - Yeah.

596
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:55,819
You come into our country,
you fuck our women.

597
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:57,987
Yeah, you got some big
fucking balls, huh?

598
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,689
- Put the fucking knife down
and calm down, all right, man?
- Oh, my god!

599
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:00,890
They get the point.

600
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:02,058
You thought you were
a big man, huh?

601
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,092
He gets it, Roy!
He's fucking shaking.

602
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:05,161
I thought you were a big man.

603
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:07,130
- Put the fucking knife down!
- Fuck you, motherfucker!

604
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,232
I'll fucking gut you,
you piece of shit!

605
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:10,733
Now go, fucker!

606
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:14,938
- Come on, let's go!
- Shit! Fuck, Nate.

607
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,707
Goddamn it!
You're fucking lucky!

608
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,543
What the fuck is your problem?

609
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:21,744
You fucked the whole thing up!

610
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:23,046
Yeah, I think they got
the message, Roy!

611
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:25,782
Got the message?
Are you a fucking idiot?

612
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:27,116
Man, those two were mine!

613
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:30,820
And then your dumb
fucking ass decides...

614
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:34,023
Hang on, wait a minute...
First you tried to stop me,

615
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:35,258
then you try to scare them off,

616
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,793
and then you set off
that fucking alarm.

617
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:39,496
That wasn't an accident, was it?
Was it, Nate?

618
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:42,732
You wanted them to get away.
What the fuck, Nate?

619
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:44,167
Huh? I said what the fuck?

620
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,169
Okay, you're goddamn right
i wanted them to get away!

621
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,505
You want to be a soldier,
Roy and not a fucking thug?

622
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:51,007
Then think! You think about
security cameras, Roy?

623
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,909
You think about the liquor store
we were just in?

624
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:55,545
You think about the clerk
or the license plates
on my fucking truck?

625
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:57,280
You think about
any of that shit?

626
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,716
Fucking Aryan warrior...

627
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:02,051
A hundred spics and niggers
ain't worth the life
of one white man,

628
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,820
but go ahead,
put us all in prison.

629
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,989
That's how you're gonna
win your race war? Huh?

630
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,726
Fuck!

631
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:11,728
All right, whatever,
can we just get back on the road

632
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,796
and get the fuck out of here?

633
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,670
Fuck!

634
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,573
<i> I ran those license plates.</i>

635
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:27,777
<i> An accountant, a school</i>
<i> teacher, a lawyer, fireman,</i>

636
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:30,580
<i> he's an engineer,</i>
<i>not a criminal record in sight,</i>

637
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:34,717
<i> but Andrew Blackwell,</i>
<i> he's a different story.</i>

638
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,952
<i> Why is he here?</i>

639
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:37,820
Uh, he said he was
going to wolf's rally.

640
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:40,189
He's the national director
of the Aryan alliance.

641
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:43,126
They're based in Ohio,
he wouldn't just come all
this way to be in a rally.

642
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:44,627
Wait, if wolf
is involved in this,

643
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:46,296
he can't be
doing it alone, right?

644
00:42:46,298 --> 00:42:48,998
I mean, he'd need help,
and organization.

645
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,303
Exactly, so you need to
figure out how wolf
and Blackwell are connected,

646
00:42:53,305 --> 00:42:55,204
and why he's really here.

647
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:10,053
Vince, good to see you.

648
00:43:10,055 --> 00:43:12,789
Rich, can we
get some literature, please?

649
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,127
- White power.
- White power.

650
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,021
Okay, we're gettin' ready
to get started here.

651
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,856
Can everyone take a seat?

652
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:50,226
<i> Most times I'd talked to you,</i>

653
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:53,363
<i> I focus on our survival,</i>

654
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:56,766
<i> the terrible struggle</i>
<i> to save our people</i>

655
00:43:56,768 --> 00:44:00,036
<i> before they are lost forever.</i>

656
00:44:00,038 --> 00:44:03,339
<i> But what about the future?</i>

657
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:05,842
<i> What do we dream of?</i>

658
00:44:05,844 --> 00:44:09,145
<i> What is the world</i>
<i> we wish to build?</i>

659
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,114
<i> I'll tell you.</i>

660
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:16,119
<i>It will be a world like the one</i>
<i>that shaped our race in Europe.</i>

661
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:22,091
<i> A world of forests,</i>
<i> mountains, and lakes.</i>

662
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:26,663
<i> Not a world of concrete,</i>
<i> asphalt, and garbage.</i>

663
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:32,335
<i> And instead of 300 million</i>
<i> race-less mulattos,</i>

664
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:34,737
<i> breeding and infesting.</i>

665
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:40,043
<i> Imagine a continent</i>
<i> of 50 million white Europeans.</i>

666
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:46,949
<i> Smarter, stronger, healthier,</i>

667
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:49,285
<i> noble men and women</i>

668
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:54,791
<i> living and working together</i>
<i> in Harmony and unity.</i>

669
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,928
<i> That's the world I see.</i>

670
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,431
<i> That's what keeps me strong.</i>

671
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:05,968
<i> That's the nation</i>
<i> we can build... together.</i>

672
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,113
If you take
millions of white people,

673
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:21,884
and flood every country
in Africa with them,
what do they call that?

674
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:24,320
Genocide.

675
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:29,859
But what's happening to
every white country on earth?

676
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:31,928
You've got
affirmative action...

677
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,363
...that kills white jobs.

678
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:38,201
Abortion,
that kills white babies.

679
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:41,804
Gay rights,
that kill white families.

680
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:45,808
Folks, let me
explain something to you.

681
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:49,245
"Diversity" is a code word.

682
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:53,883
And what it means is
white genocide!

683
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,392
So, we'll begin
marching at the courthouse.
And after two blocks--

684
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:06,028
wait a minute, wait a minute.
This is not the order
that we agreed to.

685
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,097
Aryan alliance is supposed to be
heading this march.

686
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,298
Now just a second, Andrew.

687
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,867
You know,
we're at this rally every year,

688
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:12,468
and we start with
the colonial patriots.

689
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,103
Well, this isn't
"every year," is it?

690
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,072
To be fair, Harris,
maybe we should.

691
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:17,206
You're a local organization...

692
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,842
Vince, can you
introduce me to Dallas?

693
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:21,344
"The klan"?
You're not "the klan."

694
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:23,079
Yeah, sure.
Come on, let's go.

695
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:24,814
You're the
"invisible white knights"
of the ku klux klan!

696
00:46:24,816 --> 00:46:27,517
Which is what, the third klan
group in the DC Metro area?!

697
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:29,418
Hey, Dallas! Good to see you.

698
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:33,523
It's... it's Vince,
Vince sargent?

699
00:46:33,525 --> 00:46:36,359
Right, Vince. Good to see you.

700
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:38,194
Good to see you.
I want to introduce you

701
00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:39,962
to my good friend,
this is Nate Thomas.

702
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,864
- I'm a huge fan of your show.
- Thank you, sir.

703
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:43,933
If you'll excuse me. I have to
get ready for the march.

704
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:58,915
- Uh, Mr. wolf?
- Yes, what is it?

705
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:00,349
I didn't want to
get into this in front of Vince,

706
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:02,351
but I'd like to talk to you
about an investment.

707
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,421
- An "investment"?
- Mm-hm.

708
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:08,558
I represent a few people
who are big fans of yours,
and they want to help.

709
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,960
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

710
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:13,196
They have a number of assets
in the online media space,

711
00:47:13,198 --> 00:47:16,532
and they feel the potential
for your show is being limited
by your advertising budget.

712
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:18,901
They want to help you
penetrate some new markets,

713
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:22,038
and they see no reason
why you can't go nationwide.

714
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,043
Well, that is great, son.
That is just great.

715
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:32,081
Here, call this number
and we'll talk.

716
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:33,883
Okay, great.
That sounds great, Mr. wolf.

717
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:36,152
- Call me, Dallas.
- Thank you.

718
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:43,092
Racist scum! Racist scum!

719
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,403
We're here today
because we're proud of our race!

720
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,573
We love our race!

721
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:59,375
And we're here to say that.

722
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,544
- White power!
- - White power!

723
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:06,148
The white race
is under attack in this country.

724
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,985
- White rights!
- - White rights!

725
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:11,087
But nobody seems to give a damn!

726
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:13,556
- White freedom!
- - White freedom!

727
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:17,894
- Where's al sharpton?
- - Fuckin' rednecks!

728
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:22,598
Where's Jesse Jackson
to fight for white rights!

729
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,201
- White power!
- - White power!

730
00:48:25,203 --> 00:48:27,169
White equality!

731
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:30,072
- White pride!
- - White pride!

732
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:36,913
If you're white, and you are
standing over there...

733
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:39,348
- White freedom!
- - White freedom!

734
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:42,518
...you're on the wrong side
of that barricade!

735
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,054
- White rights!
- - White rights!

736
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,390
Nate!

737
00:48:47,392 --> 00:48:51,294
Wake up, white people! Wake up!

738
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:53,963
- White power!
- - White power!

739
00:48:53,965 --> 00:48:59,535
It's morning in America
and there's a new day coming.

740
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:03,339
- Nate! What are you doing, man?
- Shut the fuck up, nigger!

741
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:07,276
Come join your race!

742
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,678
That's some fucker
that works in my building.

743
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,314
Come join the white race!

744
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:13,049
White race!

745
00:49:13,051 --> 00:49:14,717
- White power!
- White power!

746
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:16,953
- White power!
- White power!

747
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:18,688
- White power!
- White power!

748
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:21,023
- White power!
- White power!

749
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:24,593
Racist scum!
Racist scum! Racist bum!

750
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:26,228
It's the fucking afl.

751
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,164
Don't worry, they won't do shit.

752
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:33,536
Well, well, well, if it isn't
the American fucking losers!

753
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:37,440
Yeah, fuck you!
Why don't you

754
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:39,742
come over the fucking barricade,
motherfuckers!

755
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:41,310
Johnny!

756
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,148
Hey, man,
just fucking stay back, okay?

757
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,683
- Don't fucking do it.
- I gotta help him.

758
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:50,152
Help him by not getting
the fuck arrested, okay?

759
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,188
- Fucking pussies!
- - White Nazi scum!

760
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,522
Yeah, you know what?
I can do that shit, too.

761
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:55,591
I'm gonna fucking kill you,
motherfucker!

762
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:58,327
- Do not engage. Do not engage.
- You think I'm playing around?

763
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,730
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Get your hands off of me!

764
00:50:00,732 --> 00:50:02,164
I'm gonna
kill these motherfuckers!

765
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,499
Stay back!

766
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,568
- White power!
- - White pride!

767
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,470
- White power!
- - White pride!

768
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:19,215
He hit me in the fucking eye!
It's fucking piss!

769
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:33,496
Johnny!

770
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:41,537
Andrew, can you walk?

771
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:51,747
Get the fuck outta here.

772
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,383
You okay? Everyone okay?

773
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,519
Sorry. Okay.

774
00:50:56,521 --> 00:50:57,720
Stay with us.

775
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:59,655
I'm getting
you out of here, man.

776
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,293
Go... go right, go right!

777
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,699
Oh, fuck!

778
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:12,401
- Fuck!
- Fucking...

779
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:14,770
Holy shit!

780
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:16,539
We gotta go!
We gotta fucking go!

781
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,512
I can't fucking go anywhere!

782
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,681
Stay down!

783
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:41,831
Fuck!

784
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:56,445
No, don't get up.
You need to rest.

785
00:51:56,447 --> 00:52:00,282
I brought you
some chamomile tea.
It'll help you relax.

786
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,450
Thank you.

787
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,552
There's our wounded warrior.

788
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:05,354
How you feeling, buddy?

789
00:52:05,356 --> 00:52:07,156
Yeah, much better.
Thank you, guys.

790
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:12,128
Ah, no problem.
I'm gonna put some music on.

791
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:15,164
I brought you Sammy
to keep you company.

792
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:16,565
Thanks.

793
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:19,168
Oh, wow.

794
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,137
You like it?

795
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,606
I... I love brahms.

796
00:52:23,608 --> 00:52:26,275
See, Becky,
i knew he was quality.

797
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:28,277
I think the fourth
is my favorite.

798
00:52:28,279 --> 00:52:30,646
Yeah, mine, too.
Except maybe the--

799
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,148
the first?

800
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,482
Yeah.

801
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,251
Now listen, if you like brahms,

802
00:52:35,253 --> 00:52:38,921
I've got this clarinet quintet
that will blow your mind.

803
00:52:38,923 --> 00:52:42,224
They're dead, Gerry. Dead.

804
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:44,293
I'm gonna find them,
and we're gonna string them up--

805
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:45,728
alright, I hear ya. I hear ya.

806
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:49,765
That's why I avoid the
political stuff. Not my thing.

807
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:51,367
Besides, I've heard
it can be dangerous.

808
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,173
That was fantastic. Thank you...

809
00:52:57,175 --> 00:52:58,707
I thought you guys
were vegetarians.

810
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:01,844
Everybody's gotta have a few
vices every now and then.

811
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,180
What's "vices"?

812
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:06,282
Oh, boy, there we go!

813
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:09,185
I'm sorry about that,
that's my ride.

814
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:11,754
Gerry, Becky,
thanks for everything.

815
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:13,622
Nathan, I don't know
what to say.

816
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:15,291
I owe you, big time.

817
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:17,960
Why don't you stop by
the compound some time.

818
00:53:17,962 --> 00:53:21,630
Oh, I'm not really
in Ohio that much,
but I'd love to if I ever am.

819
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:24,200
No, I meant the...
The new one.

820
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:26,502
- Oh.
- Here in Virginia.

821
00:53:26,504 --> 00:53:29,805
Oh, right, yeah,
please, I'd love to.

822
00:53:29,807 --> 00:53:31,373
- Bye.
- Have a good night.

823
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,642
Bye, Andrew!

824
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:36,278
Well, listen, you're not
going to believe it,

825
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:40,716
but when it
comes to tchaikovsky...
Gotta go with Bernstein.

826
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,718
- Leonard Bernstein?
- I know, I know.

827
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,453
Gerry, I hate to
break it to you, man--

828
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:47,223
I know. Listen, I can't help it,
he's a great conductor.

829
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:49,892
Jews listen to Wagner,
don't they?

830
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:57,866
So, Gerry,
if you don't mind my asking,

831
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:01,604
how did you
end up in the movement?

832
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,974
Listen, for me,
it was the books.

833
00:54:04,976 --> 00:54:08,010
My parents
were practically liberals.

834
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:10,479
Totally blinded by the zog.

835
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:13,949
You know, I always knew
something was wrong;

836
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,985
and I had this anger,

837
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:20,322
I couldn't put my
finger on it, until...

838
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,758
...here.

839
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:26,595
It all started with this.

840
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:30,532
I was 13.
Read it in four days.

841
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:34,637
It explains race,
culture, capitalism

842
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:37,539
and how democracy
destroyed western civilization.

843
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:39,842
Democracy:
"Three people form a government.

844
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:41,977
Then two of them vote to steal
the wealth of the third."

845
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:43,746
- David Lane, right?
- Mm-hm.

846
00:54:43,748 --> 00:54:46,582
Now here's something
more recent. You'll love this.

847
00:54:46,584 --> 00:54:50,819
This breaks down the entire
worldwide zionist conspiracy,
step by step.

848
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:52,554
- You can bring it back.
- Oh, no, I couldn't.

849
00:54:52,556 --> 00:54:54,556
Nate, Nate, please.

850
00:54:56,326 --> 00:55:01,063
But that was it? I mean,
it was just books woke you up?

851
00:55:01,065 --> 00:55:02,965
Well, you know,
i had my theories.

852
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:06,502
And then a three-month
engineering contract
opened up in Kenya.

853
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:09,004
I was young,
i wanted to see the world.

854
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:13,575
And, uh, Nate, listen,

855
00:55:13,577 --> 00:55:17,980
I got no problem with them
having their own country,
everybody should.

856
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,949
But if you go there,
and you see,

857
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:23,719
they weren't even
living like animals.

858
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:27,389
You know, animals don't live
in their own feces, do they?

859
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,359
So, if you ever have any doubt

860
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:33,762
white men created civilization,
just go have a look.

861
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:07,796
<i> Hey.</i>

862
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:10,399
<i> So, how was the brahms?</i>

863
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:12,968
<i> How do you reason</i>
<i> with someone like that?</i>

864
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:15,871
<i> How can you ever hope</i>
<i> to change their mind?</i>

865
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:20,008
<i> Listen, you need to</i> <i>remember why you're doing this.
</i> <i> We're not social workers.</i>

866
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,811
<i> You wanted me to relate</i>
<i>to them as human beings, right?</i>

867
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:24,680
<i> "Open up to them?" You said.</i>

868
00:56:24,682 --> 00:56:26,749
<i> ...they weren't even</i>
<i> living like animals.</i>

869
00:56:26,751 --> 00:56:28,450
<i> You want to get a drink?</i>

870
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:30,552
<i> Where are we gonna go</i>
<i> and get a drink?</i>

871
00:56:32,523 --> 00:56:34,790
This suspect,
he was a fucking nightmare.

872
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:36,959
He was grabbing my ass,
the whole thing.

873
00:56:36,961 --> 00:56:38,927
And he kept insisting
i go to this club with him,

874
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:41,497
where I knew he was gonna
make his big move,

875
00:56:41,499 --> 00:56:44,666
but if I didn't go,
then, you know, I could
blow my whole cover.

876
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:46,435
So what did you do?

877
00:56:46,437 --> 00:56:48,904
So we're at a bar,
and I tell him I want oysters.

878
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,740
So I get a dozen,
i start plowing through them.

879
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:53,409
Then I start acting queasy.

880
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:55,844
I run to the bathroom,
stick my finger down my throat.

881
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:57,179
- No way!
- Yeah!

882
00:56:57,181 --> 00:56:59,481
So now there's puke
all over my dress,

883
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:02,718
I tell him I got sick off the
oysters and take a cab home.

884
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,520
Two days later, he was arrested.

885
00:57:04,522 --> 00:57:07,756
- That is fucking awesome.
- Oh, it was fucked up.

886
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:10,759
But there was the thrill,
you know? That high.

887
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:12,995
God, there's nothing like it.

888
00:57:12,997 --> 00:57:15,130
Yeah, so why'd you stop?

889
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:18,667
It was just...

890
00:57:18,669 --> 00:57:23,138
...it's no way to live,
the paranoia, the tension.

891
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:26,442
And I wanted to spend
more time with my kids.

892
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:27,676
You got kids?

893
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:29,211
You don't think
I'm mommy material?

894
00:57:29,213 --> 00:57:30,179
No, no... no.

895
00:57:30,181 --> 00:57:32,881
Yeah, I got two princesses.

896
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:37,486
Mommy and daddy.
Perfect, little suburban life.

897
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:43,625
Anyway, I know how lonely
this work can be.

898
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,627
But the case won't go forever.

899
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,096
You can't change
the way people think,

900
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:51,633
but you are making a difference.

901
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,924
Nathan, good to see you.

902
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:18,126
Can we get you anything, coffee?

903
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:19,528
Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.

904
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:20,963
This is a great
set-up you got here.

905
00:58:20,965 --> 00:58:23,632
Yeah, thanks.

906
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:25,534
All right,
let's give you the tour.

907
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,937
This parcel is actually
pretty small,

908
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:30,939
but we're purchasing
the one next to it.

909
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:33,976
Although, citizen's groups
are trying to block us out.

910
00:58:33,978 --> 00:58:35,244
Oh, yeah.
How are you handling that?

911
00:58:35,246 --> 00:58:37,546
Well, we tell them
we're here to stay.

912
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:39,681
Make no mistake about it.
We show up at their homes,

913
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:41,617
their businesses,
their churches.

914
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:43,785
They backed down
pretty quick after that.

915
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:46,188
So you're moving
the national headquarters?

916
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,924
No, we're keeping
the compound in Ohio,

917
00:58:48,926 --> 00:58:53,829
it's just with everything
going on right now, we needed
a stronger presence here.

918
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:55,130
You know?

919
00:58:55,132 --> 00:58:57,299
- Is that your firing range?
- Yeah, come on.

920
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:04,072
It's a little primitive,
but we're working on it.

921
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:09,011
I'm no marksman, by any means,

922
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:10,879
but I have some expertise
in range design,

923
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,848
just from training
the Iraqi police.

924
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,950
What's your
danger area template?

925
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,953
To contain your cone of fire.

926
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:22,658
I mean, how do you control
your overshoot?

927
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,860
Uh...
We haven't gotten to that yet.

928
00:59:24,862 --> 00:59:27,896
Okay, well,
you might want to make sure

929
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,731
it's the kikes and niggers
getting hit and not your guys.

930
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:32,200
Absolutely.
Maybe if you have time,

931
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:34,202
- you could talk to
the guys about it.
- Yeah, sure,

932
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:36,939
I need to see what
kind of equipment you've got,
but I'm happy to.

933
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:41,076
Okay. Uh, come on up here.

934
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:48,984
Right now were just
using this for storage.

935
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,654
- Are those cots?
- Yup.

936
00:59:52,656 --> 00:59:56,692
We'll be able to
sleep 200 in there.
And we're gonna need to.

937
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,829
I'm not gonna
beat around the bush.

938
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:03,599
You see the type of
organization we have here,

939
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:05,734
but we could always
use a man like you, Nathan.

940
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:09,304
Educated, war veteran,
clean record.

941
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:12,174
I mean, hell, you don't even
have any parking tickets.

942
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,377
Yeah, we have our contacts

943
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:17,913
in law enforcement,
local, state, federal,

944
01:00:17,915 --> 01:00:21,283
not to mention
military hospitals,
laboratories, you name it.

945
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:23,785
And so what's
the overall objective here?

946
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:26,154
I mean, are you just trying
to get the message out, or what?

947
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:29,191
Get the... get the message out?

948
01:00:29,193 --> 01:00:30,926
To who?

949
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:33,662
We're not trying to recruit
the public here.

950
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:36,098
What would we do with them?
They're at home
sitting on their asses,

951
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:39,668
- watching sitcoms
and surfing Facebook.

952
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:43,105
This is revolutionary activity
we're talking about here.

953
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:49,745
Look, I'm flattered by
the interest, but, you know,

954
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:53,782
I've been around the movement
awhile now and a lot of these
guys are all talk.

955
01:00:53,784 --> 01:00:56,018
Now for me
to really want to get involved,

956
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:59,054
I need to know there's
bigger things going on here.

957
01:00:59,056 --> 01:01:00,889
No offense.

958
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:05,761
Yeah... none taken.

959
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:10,966
All right...

960
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,369
Take a look at this.

961
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:25,947
This is the entire
DC water system.

962
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:29,885
Plants, pipelines,
the whole deal.

963
01:01:29,887 --> 01:01:32,187
Now, Nathan, the guys
you're hanging out with,

964
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:34,856
they're all talk,
because they're punks.

965
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:38,160
They're amateurs.
They sit around
drinking beer all day,

966
01:01:38,162 --> 01:01:42,064
maybe they beat up
a few niggers or each other.

967
01:01:42,066 --> 01:01:46,368
We got no use for them.
We need men like you.

968
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,823
Can I help you?

969
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:10,358
I'm looking for Dallas wolf,
but I must have the wrong house.

970
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,929
Oh, no, he's here. Come in.

971
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:17,432
Randy! Someone's here!

972
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:19,835
Hey, Nate.

973
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:23,004
The studio's back here.

974
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:27,943
I'm moving studios right now,
so this is all temporary.

975
01:02:27,945 --> 01:02:29,911
Oh, no, this is a great setup.

976
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:32,180
Thanks for taking
the time to see me, Dallas.

977
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:36,251
I just spent the afternoon with
Andrew at the Aryan alliance.

978
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:38,253
Oh, yeah? Andrew's great.

979
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:40,756
They have
an incredible organization.

980
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:43,892
Yeah, they seem really
serious about the struggle.

981
01:02:43,894 --> 01:02:45,494
About doing whatever it takes.

982
01:02:45,496 --> 01:02:48,296
They're true patriots,
those guys.

983
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:52,467
Well, let me give you
a bit of background on me.

984
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:55,504
I was in Iraq for three years,
on a wmd squad.

985
01:02:55,506 --> 01:02:59,174
And then when I got back,
my military contacts helped me
set up a medical supply company.

986
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:04,980
Go to medvale.Com
if you want to check it out.

987
01:03:04,982 --> 01:03:07,015
V-a-l-e.

988
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:16,458
Wow, this is great.

989
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:20,128
Yeah, we do it all,
from bandages and syringes

990
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,497
to X-ray
and radiotherapy equipment.

991
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:24,266
And with the
highly regulated stuff,

992
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:25,834
we can cut through
a lot of the red tape

993
01:03:25,836 --> 01:03:27,969
and deal directly,
and discreetly.

994
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:31,106
Fantastic, Nate.
Great to know.

995
01:03:31,108 --> 01:03:35,343
So... you'd also mentioned
an investment? For the show?

996
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:40,115
Yes, I've got an investor
lined up who's very excited
about expanding your reach.

997
01:03:40,117 --> 01:03:43,518
We're talking advertising,
marketing, bigger servers...

998
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,289
That's exactly what I need.
So how do I meet him?

999
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:51,259
Well, a lot of my
military contacts don't like
to publicize their efforts.

1000
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:56,064
But he'd love for you
to put together a proposal
about how you'd expand the show.

1001
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:58,200
Funny you should mention that.

1002
01:03:58,202 --> 01:04:03,605
I've been trying to raise $7,500
to break into
the Florida market.

1003
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:06,942
They're ripe right now,
with all the immigration stuff.

1004
01:04:06,944 --> 01:04:09,878
Yeah... yeah, this is great!

1005
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:14,482
So, there's one more thing.

1006
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:16,418
Go ahead, shoot.

1007
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:21,223
The reason he's helping you
is because he feels

1008
01:04:21,225 --> 01:04:27,495
that you are a man of action,
as he is. As I am.

1009
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:30,332
Right, sure.

1010
01:04:30,334 --> 01:04:31,533
So for him to move forward,

1011
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:35,003
he needs to know
you're serious about this.

1012
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:42,244
Nate, I've been ready
to give my life for this cause
for 20 years now.

1013
01:04:42,246 --> 01:04:45,480
What I need is
the right people behind me.

1014
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:52,487
So you tell your investor
that if he wants action,
he's got the right guy.

1015
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:59,628
Um, sorry, Dallas, I've got
kind of a long drive back,
you mind if I hit the head?

1016
01:05:15,311 --> 01:05:17,479
The whole case
is about to blow wide open!

1017
01:05:17,481 --> 01:05:19,481
He's in with wolf,
he's in with the Aryan alliance.

1018
01:05:19,483 --> 01:05:22,450
Yeah, and all we need to keep
wolf on the line is that $7,500!

1019
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:25,086
Let me get this straight.
So after everything
we spent on your cover,

1020
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:26,621
even after
the medical supply business,

1021
01:05:26,623 --> 01:05:26,621
you want me to ask for $7,500

1022
01:05:26,623 --> 01:05:30,458
<i> as an "investment"</i>
<i> in this guy's radio show?</i>

1023
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,660
You're the only one
with a budget right now!

1024
01:05:31,662 --> 01:05:33,395
Oh, yeah,
I'm just flush with cash!

1025
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:35,163
I'm trying to run
a 40-man investigation

1026
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:37,032
<i> on top of all the shit</i>
<i> I've already got!</i>

1027
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:40,502
Sir, the alliance is building
a compound outside DC.

1028
01:05:40,504 --> 01:05:42,437
Wolf's house is setting off
a geiger counter!

1029
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:44,539
I spent six hours last night
reading your transcripts,

1030
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:45,507
Nate, you don't have shit!

1031
01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:47,509
<i> You don't have shit!</i>

1032
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:51,947
Look at how much carbon
is built up on this bolt.

1033
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:54,115
- See? See that? Like--
- yeah.

1034
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:56,017
That's unacceptable. When's the
last time you cleaned this?

1035
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:57,419
I've been meaning
to get to most of them.

1036
01:05:57,421 --> 01:06:00,221
Okay, guys, seriously!
Okay, so we got an ar-15,

1037
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:06,361
serial number a00724,
needs a new buffer spring.
Come on, guys, let's go!

1038
01:06:06,363 --> 01:06:09,164
We need to go through
the whole inventory.
Andrew's waiting on this.

1039
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:12,434
I'm gonna have to tell Andrew,
the only way it's gonna change
is with new policies.

1040
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:14,636
And how do I know it's
not me you're trying to fuck?

1041
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:16,037
Fuck you, you calling us liars?

1042
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:17,205
You get on the phone yourself!

1043
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:19,374
Call them up and ask them...

1044
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,311
Hey, guys...

1045
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:26,514
Hey, Nate...
It's been a while.

1046
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:29,985
Yeah, you kinda
disappeared on us.

1047
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:34,022
I'm sorry about that, Vince.
I've been kind of busy.

1048
01:06:34,024 --> 01:06:35,991
Yeah, I bet you have.

1049
01:06:35,993 --> 01:06:39,661
Seems like you made a bunch of
new friends around here, huh?

1050
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,563
See, we were just wondering
if maybe you could explain--

1051
01:06:41,565 --> 01:06:43,031
Roy!

1052
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:49,337
Thanks for stopping by.

1053
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:54,109
Be seeing you, Nate.

1054
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:07,722
What was that all about?

1055
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:11,226
Roy says the police
have been following him.

1056
01:07:11,228 --> 01:07:13,728
He's paranoid
about infiltrators.

1057
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,564
Infiltrators, huh?

1058
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:18,166
Yeah.

1059
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:22,237
Mm. That's why the police
are on his ass?

1060
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,639
Have you seen
how that guy behaves?

1061
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:27,275
It's a miracle
he's not in jail already.

1062
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:34,349
Right, uh, you want to
help us with something?

1063
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:36,217
Sure, what's up?

1064
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:38,520
I'm throwing a youth event
for Hitler's birthday.

1065
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:41,222
There's a campground
a couple miles from here.

1066
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:44,793
- Help us scout it.
- Sounds good.

1067
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:50,598
It's amazing how much land
there is right outside DC.

1068
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:58,440
Let me ask you something,
Nathan.

1069
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:02,477
What's your opinion
on infiltration?

1070
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,448
Well, how do you mean?

1071
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:09,451
How do we prevent it?

1072
01:08:09,453 --> 01:08:11,653
Well, it's tough.

1073
01:08:11,655 --> 01:08:15,190
For one thing, you gotta keep
guys with rap sheets
out of important positions.

1074
01:08:15,192 --> 01:08:19,227
That's... that's how
they flip most people.

1075
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:22,163
We have a polygraph
back at the compound.

1076
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,635
Maybe we should
make everybody take it.

1077
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:30,705
I mean,
i think someone who's trained

1078
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:33,241
can beat a polygraph
without blinking.

1079
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:42,183
Yeah, maybe we should
just do a background checks
for everybody.

1080
01:08:42,185 --> 01:08:45,520
Get everyone's records
and documents together?

1081
01:08:45,522 --> 01:08:48,189
Yeah, I mean, for informants,
that might work.

1082
01:08:48,191 --> 01:08:51,559
But for law enforcement, they
just forge whatever they need.

1083
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:58,166
Yeah, but with a few
phone calls, you know,
a cover only runs so deep.

1084
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:01,436
Do you suspect someone?

1085
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:07,342
You know, it's like they say
at these rallies.

1086
01:09:07,344 --> 01:09:12,614
You look to the left,
look to the right,
one of these people is a snitch.

1087
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:21,589
It's the left.

1088
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,561
Turn left right up here.

1089
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:13,541
You okay there, Nate?

1090
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:19,647
You look a little off?

1091
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:23,918
No, I'm good.

1092
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,389
Just, uh, tired...
Been a long day.

1093
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,564
Well, I think this is a great
location. What do you think?

1094
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:39,500
Yeah, I like it.

1095
01:10:39,502 --> 01:10:42,537
Uh, well, what about
the permits, though?

1096
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:46,407
We tell them we're
a Christian organization,

1097
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:47,875
holding a youth event.

1098
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:56,251
I gotta ask you something.

1099
01:10:57,419 --> 01:11:00,688
Roy said he contacted the nprc.

1100
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:06,294
Said there's no record of you
having served in the marines.

1101
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:14,035
You mean Roy
went and filed a 180

1102
01:11:14,037 --> 01:11:19,974
with a government that he
fucking hates, just to... okay.

1103
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:22,977
I was on a wmd squad,
so that's black ops.

1104
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:25,313
And he knows that, the fucker.

1105
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:30,551
Wait, hold on, are you guys
taking this seriously?

1106
01:11:30,553 --> 01:11:32,754
Is that what that
was all about in the truck?

1107
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:34,589
Because, I understand
you have to do your
due diligence or whatever,

1108
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:35,957
but that's a fucking
serious accusation!

1109
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:37,558
I don't need to take
that shit from anybody!

1110
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,394
- Hey... hey, hey!
- Least of all from--

1111
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,400
okay.

1112
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:51,406
Let's get out of here.

1113
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:02,517
<i> Nate, listen.
</i> <i> We need to get the serial</i> <i> numbers first, and then--</i>

1114
01:12:02,519 --> 01:12:03,951
no, look, I don't have
time for that!

1115
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:06,954
What if he wasn't convinced?
What if he calls wolf?

1116
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:09,023
The account name
is Nate foster, please.

1117
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:10,725
You don't know
if he was convinced!

1118
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:14,028
You don't even know if they
talk, okay? You're being--

1119
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:16,664
yeah, I'd like $7,500 in cash.

1120
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,937
You're a man of your word,

1121
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:27,075
which is a rare thing
in this movement.

1122
01:12:27,077 --> 01:12:30,845
So, listen, Dallas,
my investor is very excited,

1123
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:36,617
but he wants to know some more
about what you're planning,
some details.

1124
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:39,487
Oh, okay, I think it was
all in the presentation,

1125
01:12:39,489 --> 01:12:43,725
but we start
with online in tampa,
and then we move down the--

1126
01:12:43,727 --> 01:12:48,363
- no, no, I mean, beyond that.
- Beyond Florida?

1127
01:12:48,365 --> 01:12:52,066
Beyond the show,
like what we talked about.

1128
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:56,871
The actions we're gonna take.

1129
01:12:56,873 --> 01:13:00,675
I'm sorry, Nate. I lost you.
What do you mean?

1130
01:13:00,677 --> 01:13:07,615
What I mean is, you have been
talking a lot about a lot of
big things that are coming.

1131
01:13:07,617 --> 01:13:09,684
Bigger than Oklahoma city,
bigger than 9/11--

1132
01:13:09,686 --> 01:13:11,552
oh, yeah, for sure.

1133
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:14,589
Which is why expanding
the show is so important.

1134
01:13:14,591 --> 01:13:18,626
Right, and I have been
spending a lot of time with
Andrew at the Aryan alliance.

1135
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:21,062
He told me
you'd been working together.

1136
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:25,767
Well, yeah, sure,
i mean, he came to the rally.

1137
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:29,971
No, no, what my investor
needs to know is what are

1138
01:13:29,973 --> 01:13:34,409
the concrete steps that you are
taking to start the race war.

1139
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:36,477
As I said to you before,

1140
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:38,780
I have the expertise,
the connections, the tools.

1141
01:13:38,782 --> 01:13:42,083
Maybe there's some kind
of misunderstanding.

1142
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:45,052
I thought we were talking about
expanding the show.

1143
01:13:45,054 --> 01:13:47,822
Yeah, which my investor
is happy to do,

1144
01:13:47,824 --> 01:13:50,191
but if you're not willing to be
honest about the other actions
you're taking,

1145
01:13:50,193 --> 01:13:53,161
then he's not gonna
be able to support you.

1146
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:59,167
Okay, Nate, fair enough.

1147
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,473
Sorry it didn't work out.

1148
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:17,685
I saw the plans, Dallas,
for the water system.

1149
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,623
Andrew showed them to me, okay?

1150
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:26,494
So, I know all about it,
and now I just need you

1151
01:14:26,496 --> 01:14:30,231
to stop pretending
and be honest with me.

1152
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:37,705
This is private property.

1153
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:41,609
You're no longer welcome here.
I'm asking you to leave.

1154
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,812
Come on, Dallas.
I'm on your side.

1155
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:48,149
Get the fuck out. Now.

1156
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:02,563
Fuck.

1157
01:15:02,565 --> 01:15:03,698
<i> We're going to the office,</i>

1158
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,500
<i> Dallas wolf is there.</i>

1159
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:06,567
<i> You brought him in?</i>

1160
01:15:06,569 --> 01:15:09,036
<i> No. He came to us.</i>

1161
01:15:11,241 --> 01:15:15,076
Sir.
I didn't know you'd be here.

1162
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:19,614
Has anyone talked to him?

1163
01:15:19,616 --> 01:15:22,016
No, no, of course not.
No, it's your show.

1164
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:26,153
So, Dallas.
Or should I call you Randy?
That is your real name.

1165
01:15:26,155 --> 01:15:29,590
You can call me whatever
you like, agent zamparo.

1166
01:15:29,592 --> 01:15:31,826
Any reason you're using
an assumed name?

1167
01:15:31,828 --> 01:15:33,928
I'm a public entertainer.

1168
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:35,763
Ah... fine.

1169
01:15:35,765 --> 01:15:37,298
So, tell me
why you're here today.

1170
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:40,601
I'm here because of
the guy I called about.

1171
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:43,704
He shows up at my conference,
talking about investing
in my show.

1172
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:47,642
<i> But then, he's telling me</i>
<i> how he can get</i>
<i> highly regulated items.</i>

1173
01:15:47,644 --> 01:15:51,746
<i> And talking about</i>
<i> plans to the water system,</i>
<i> and threatening me!</i>

1174
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:54,615
<i> His name is Nate Thomas,</i>
<i> and if he does anything crazy,</i>

1175
01:15:54,617 --> 01:15:56,250
<i> I don't want to be</i>
<i> associated with it.</i>

1176
01:15:56,252 --> 01:15:58,986
Hm. Did he give you money?

1177
01:15:58,988 --> 01:16:00,688
- He tried to.
- How much?

1178
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:03,324
- $7,500.
- Wow. That's a lot.

1179
01:16:03,326 --> 01:16:05,960
- Why would he do that?
- Because he's a wacko!

1180
01:16:05,962 --> 01:16:07,895
<i> A lot of these</i>
<i> nut jobs approach me.</i>

1181
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:09,764
<i> But this guy</i>
<i> is on another level.</i>

1182
01:16:09,766 --> 01:16:13,701
<i> So you have no idea</i>
<i> why you, of all people,</i>

1183
01:16:13,703 --> 01:16:15,736
<i> would be approached</i>
<i> by this guy?</i>

1184
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:18,072
<i> No, agent zamparo, I don't.</i>

1185
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:23,711
Right. Let me play you
something, okay, Randy.

1186
01:16:23,713 --> 01:16:25,947
<i> I have information</i>
<i> about a truck accident</i>

1187
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:32,153
<i> outside DC last night,</i>
<i> involving classified</i>
<i> radioactive material,</i>

1188
01:16:32,155 --> 01:16:37,058

<i> to cover it all up. Why?</i>

1189
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:39,260
You've gotta be kidding me.

1190
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:42,363
It's a radio show.
It's entertainment!

1191
01:16:42,365 --> 01:16:46,167
So you think it's entertaining
to predict and incite
terrorist attacks?

1192
01:16:46,169 --> 01:16:48,769
Whether I think it's
entertaining is irrelevant.

1193
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,338
Why don't you talk to
somebody around here

1194
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:53,274
who knows something about
the law, preferably a man!

1195
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:59,113
<i> Brandenburg vs. Ohio, 1969,</i>
<i> it is not illegal</i>
<i> to advocate violence.</i>

1196
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:03,117

<i>doesn't protect people who have</i>
<i> knowledge of an actual crime!</i>

1197
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:05,653
What knowledge
of a crime do I have?

1198
01:17:05,655 --> 01:17:07,388
Well, why don't you tell me,
Randy? What is this accident?

1199
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:09,390
What is this FBI cover-up?

1200
01:17:09,392 --> 01:17:11,959
Why are you living
at an unregistered address?

1201
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:15,830
And why is that location
lighting up a geiger counter?

1202
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:22,903
You've been following me?
You've been casing my house?

1203
01:17:22,905 --> 01:17:24,905
Why don't you
answer my questions?

1204

<i> Let me show you something.</i>
<i> Do you mind?</i>

<i> 301 last night,</i>

1208
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:42,657
<i> and the FBI had cordoned off</i>
<i> an accident with Hazmat tape.</i>

1209
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:45,259
<i> I haven't seen anything</i>
<i> on the news.</i>

1210
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:47,261
<i> So what is the zog</i>
<i> covering up?"</i>

1211
01:17:47,263 --> 01:17:51,365
<i> As for the unregistered</i>
<i> address, I live with my mom,</i>

1212
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:54,835
<i> and I'd like to keep that</i>
<i>private, if it's okay with you?</i>

1213
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:59,240
<i> And your geiger counter</i>
<i> is lighting up because</i>
<i> I have prostate cancer!</i>

1214
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:02,143
<i> I know your type.</i>

1215
01:18:02,145 --> 01:18:05,980
You think
you've got it all figured out,
and you don't know shit.

1216
01:18:05,982 --> 01:18:11,018
I'm an entertainer.
I do this for money,
and for fun.

1217
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:17,058
<i> And I don't give a fuck</i>
<i> about zog or the race war</i>
<i> or any of that shit.</i>

1218
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:21,796
<i> I tell these jackasses</i>
<i> what they want to hear,</i>
<i> and they worship me for it.</i>

1219
01:18:21,798 --> 01:18:25,199
<i> So fuck you, agent zamparo.</i>

1220
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:29,036
<i> Can you open the door, please?</i>

1221
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:39,714
- Now, tom, look...
- Now, tom, look, what?

1222
01:18:39,716 --> 01:18:41,949
Really, what could you
possibly have to say?

1223
01:18:41,951 --> 01:18:43,818
Because this is
a fucking disaster!

1224
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:46,887
I warned you,
i tried to tell you.

1225
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,924
- We still might have
a weapons case!
- We ran those serial numbers.

1226
01:18:49,926 --> 01:18:52,993
Every single one of those guns
is legally registered.
Every one!

1227
01:18:52,995 --> 01:18:55,129
Okay, so you think there's
nothing to any of this? Right?

1228
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:57,732
The prepaid cellphones?
The barracks for 200 guys?

1229
01:18:57,734 --> 01:19:00,434
- The water system plans?
- They're conspiracy theorists!

1230
01:19:00,436 --> 01:19:04,138
It's all talk!
He keeps those plans around

1231
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:06,774
to trot out when he wants
to act like a big shot!

1232
01:19:06,776 --> 01:19:09,410
What are they gonna do,
they're gonna put radioactive
material in the water supply?

1233
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:11,245
That doesn't make
any fucking sense!

1234
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:14,215
You two, you pull this from here
and that from there,

1235
01:19:14,217 --> 01:19:17,451
and you're making up this whole
big fucking story in your head,
and it's bullshit!

1236
01:19:17,453 --> 01:19:19,220
You know,
we see what we want to see!

1237
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:20,788
Well,
now you've compromised him,

1238
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:22,156
and you've compromised
the bureau,

1239
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:24,425
and you've wasted
all our fucking time!

1240
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,774
This happens sometimes,
you know?

1241
01:19:39,776 --> 01:19:43,177
- I mean, it sucks, but--
- "this happens"?

1242
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:49,216
Is that all
you're gonna fucking say
after we find out all of this?

1243
01:19:49,218 --> 01:19:51,952
Everything you fucking put me
through has been for nothing?

1244
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:53,988
It's the nature of the work.

1245
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:57,525
No! This... this happened
because of your pet theory!

1246
01:19:57,527 --> 01:19:59,860
And like an idiot,
i went along with it!

1247
01:19:59,862 --> 01:20:01,362
"Oh, yeah, she's an expert,"
i thought.

1248
01:20:01,364 --> 01:20:02,963
"She knows what she's doing!"

1249
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:06,267
I'm sorry, Nate.

1250
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:08,903
Fucking why?
Why are you even sorry?

1251
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:10,871
This has been great for you!
You got the thrill back!

1252
01:20:10,873 --> 01:20:12,339
You got the excitement
you've been wanting,

1253
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:14,308
you got an escape from
your little suburban life,

1254
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,177
- by manipulating me!
- No, that is not fair!

1255
01:20:16,179 --> 01:20:18,279
I thought we had a case!

1256
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:23,551
God, do you even know how many
dead ends I've been down?

1257
01:20:23,553 --> 01:20:25,252
No, you fucking knew!

1258
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:27,121
You knew I was so eager,

1259
01:20:27,123 --> 01:20:29,023
so desperate
to do something meaningful,

1260
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:31,358
to actually work on
a real case in this place,

1261
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,927
that I would do
anything you wanted,

1262
01:20:32,929 --> 01:20:35,196
while you just sat back
and enjoyed the ride!

1263
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:42,269
Yeah. Fuck!

1264
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:26,380
Nate!

1265
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:29,950
Hey, good to see you!
I've been calling you!

1266
01:21:29,952 --> 01:21:32,620
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry about
that, I've been really busy.

1267
01:21:32,622 --> 01:21:35,022
I just wanted to return these.

1268
01:21:35,024 --> 01:21:37,625
I'm heading out of town
for a couple of months,

1269
01:21:37,627 --> 01:21:40,661
gonna work on setting up
the business on the west coast.

1270
01:21:40,663 --> 01:21:43,564
Oh, wow, wow,
well, please come in.

1271
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:47,034
Uh, that's nice of you,
but I don't think I can.

1272
01:21:47,036 --> 01:21:50,170
Aw, come on,
just for a cup of tea?

1273
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:17,531
Is everything okay, Nate?

1274
01:22:17,533 --> 01:22:21,368
Yeah, yeah, why do you ask?

1275
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:25,706
Well, you said
you're headed out west.

1276
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:30,210
Yeah, I'm gonna work on
setting up the business
on the west coast.

1277
01:22:30,212 --> 01:22:31,612
Right.

1278
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:36,283
God, it's hard to find
what we're looking for in life.

1279
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:40,154
But then, I listen
to something like that.

1280
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:45,459
One man made something...
That will make millions,

1281
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:48,162
maybe billions of people
feel the way we just did.

1282
01:22:48,164 --> 01:22:51,665
We all have that power, Nate.
All of us.

1283
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:56,103
Honestly... I used to
feel that way, Gerry.

1284
01:22:57,205 --> 01:23:00,407
I always felt like
i could change the world.

1285
01:23:00,409 --> 01:23:05,479
You know, I could right wrongs,
you know, fight injustice.

1286
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:09,750
Nate, listen, it's guys like us
that feel these things the most.
Idealists.

1287
01:23:09,752 --> 01:23:12,486
Yeah, I just keep
thinking about that quote.

1288
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:18,225
"For evil to triumph,
it only takes good men
to do nothing."

1289
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:23,564
But how? You know, fucking how?

1290
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:26,667
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Gerry,
i shouldn't be...

1291
01:23:26,669 --> 01:23:28,635
- It's all right.
- I'm just really tired.

1292
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:41,281
You know, Nate,

1293
01:23:41,283 --> 01:23:43,584
maybe you're
going about this the wrong way.

1294
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:48,789
The rallies, the speeches,
the politics...

1295
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:51,392
That's not how
the change is gonna come.

1296
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:57,264
It's gonna come from
the unknown soldiers,

1297
01:23:57,266 --> 01:23:59,433
from the leaderless resistance.

1298
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:05,439
How do you mean?

1299
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,044
Let's go out back.

1300
01:24:10,046 --> 01:24:12,646
I made some improvements
to the tree house.

1301
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:22,823
Talking frankly is something we
have to be very careful about.

1302
01:24:22,825 --> 01:24:25,692
- Something we always do
outdoors.
- Right, of course.

1303
01:24:25,694 --> 01:24:29,463
You know, I've thinking
about this for a long time,
Nate, years really.

1304
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:33,567
What's needed is an event.

1305
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:36,503
What kind of event?

1306
01:24:36,505 --> 01:24:40,174
An event that wakes people up.

1307
01:24:40,176 --> 01:24:42,309
They're sleepwalkers out there.

1308
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:45,112
They're blind.
Think about this regime.

1309
01:24:45,114 --> 01:24:47,848
Media brainwashing,
secret courts,

1310
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:51,485
mass surveillance,
waco, Ruby Ridge.

1311
01:24:51,487 --> 01:24:55,622
Using Katrina and 9/11
to set up "refugee camps,"
or "detention camps",

1312
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:57,724
in other words,
concentration camps,

1313
01:24:57,726 --> 01:25:01,161
because who cares about
the rights of a few arabs,

1314
01:25:01,163 --> 01:25:03,630
niggers and racists,
if it makes us safer?

1315
01:25:03,632 --> 01:25:05,732
Right? That's how it all starts.

1316
01:25:05,734 --> 01:25:11,839
All the lies that the zionists
tell about Nazi Germany,

1317
01:25:11,841 --> 01:25:15,642
that's what's
actually happening right now!

1318
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:19,580
The irony of it!
Right?

1319
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,221
That's why we gotta be smart.

1320
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:29,690
That's why the event

1321
01:25:29,692 --> 01:25:33,527
has to force the zog
to show its hand.

1322
01:25:33,529 --> 01:25:36,864
It's gotta reveal the men
behind the curtain.

1323
01:25:36,866 --> 01:25:38,599
Because it's not the event
that wakes people up,

1324
01:25:38,601 --> 01:25:39,733
it's the reaction to the event.

1325
01:25:39,735 --> 01:25:41,869
Yes! Yes, you get it!

1326
01:25:41,871 --> 01:25:43,637
Yeah, look at the sons
of Liberty. Look at the ira.

1327
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:45,272
That is how
you start a revolution.

1328
01:25:45,274 --> 01:25:48,709
Yeah, yeah, I always felt
this kinship with you, Nate.

1329
01:25:48,711 --> 01:25:51,712
And... I wanted to talk
openly with you,

1330
01:25:51,714 --> 01:25:53,413
but I just haven't
known you that long,

1331
01:25:53,415 --> 01:25:56,583
but I know in my heart,
i can trust you.

1332
01:25:56,585 --> 01:25:59,786
You can. You can, Gerry,
i want to help.

1333
01:25:59,788 --> 01:26:01,822
I want to make a difference.

1334
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:03,724
Okay.

1335
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:09,563
I still got connections
from my Africa days.

1336
01:26:09,565 --> 01:26:15,169
Okay, and we have the means
to create that kind of event.

1337
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:17,604
But, Nate,
if you get involved...

1338
01:26:17,606 --> 01:26:20,874
...we may not live to see
the world we're building.

1339
01:26:20,876 --> 01:26:22,809
But I'll have
helped to build it.

1340
01:26:22,811 --> 01:26:25,946
A man's body dies,
but his deeds live forever.

1341
01:26:30,952 --> 01:26:32,920
There's a way you can help us.

1342
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:37,558
- Okay, yeah.
- Come here.

1343
01:26:57,979 --> 01:27:00,581
We need to talk
to the s.A.C., now!

1344
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:04,851
Oh, my lord,
who the hell wrapped it?

1345
01:27:04,853 --> 01:27:07,487
You guys aren't trying
to give it a bath!

1346
01:27:08,356 --> 01:27:10,257
Oh, hey, guys!

1347
01:27:10,259 --> 01:27:12,759
Sorry abut that,
just having some technical
difficulties over here.

1348
01:27:12,761 --> 01:27:14,628
- No problem!
- Be right over...

1349
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:16,830
- Okay, one, two...
- Hey, Morgan, David...

1350
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:21,235
I want you
to meet somebody. This is Nate.

1351
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:23,337
Morgan, good to meet you.

1352
01:27:23,339 --> 01:27:25,439
- Greetings, sir. I'm David.
- Hey, you guys.

1353
01:27:25,441 --> 01:27:26,840
So is the wedding out here?

1354
01:27:26,842 --> 01:27:29,610
Yeah, it's right over here.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1355
01:27:29,612 --> 01:27:31,478
Wait till we see it all lit up.

1356
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:34,314
Pure of spirit and pure of race,

1357
01:27:34,316 --> 01:27:37,684
these two souls commit
themselves to the defense

1358
01:27:37,686 --> 01:27:41,355
and prosperity
of their sacred blood.

1359
01:27:41,357 --> 01:27:44,992
May their sons and daughters
fill this land,

1360
01:27:44,994 --> 01:27:50,931
forever honoring their duty to
folk, kindred, soil, and honor.

1361
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:53,533
<i> I know you guys</i>
<i> don't know Nate that well.</i>

1362
01:27:53,535 --> 01:27:56,003
But he's a good man
and he's a good soldier.

1363
01:27:56,005 --> 01:27:58,672
If you trust me,
you can trust him.

1364
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:02,676
No luck yet.

1365
01:28:02,678 --> 01:28:05,479
No one wants to sell
to an anonymous buyer.

1366
01:28:05,481 --> 01:28:09,316
If we give up
that prepaid phone crap,
i use my real name,

1367
01:28:09,318 --> 01:28:12,886
I got three guys
i can get it from right now.
If we do it the morning of--

1368
01:28:12,888 --> 01:28:15,555
yeah, I thought we were
at least trying to do this
without getting caught?

1369
01:28:15,557 --> 01:28:20,761
Guys, guys, shh. Nate has
a potential solution for us.

1370
01:28:20,763 --> 01:28:24,398
Tatp. It's much better
than ammonium nitrate anyway.

1371
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,533
A smaller quantity will
give you a much bigger blast.

1372
01:28:26,535 --> 01:28:29,469
Yeah, well, sure,
but where are we gonna get that?

1373
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:30,871
I run a medical supply company.

1374
01:28:30,873 --> 01:28:32,773
And you're gonna get tatp?

1375
01:28:32,775 --> 01:28:34,741
I know it's not
the easiest thing,

1376
01:28:34,743 --> 01:28:36,343
but I've got some connections.

1377
01:28:36,345 --> 01:28:38,612
I can make a few calls
and loop back with Gerry.

1378
01:28:38,614 --> 01:28:43,850
Assuming I can,
what are we gonna do about
the cesium powder itself?

1379
01:28:43,852 --> 01:28:45,052
Ready when we need it.

1380
01:28:45,054 --> 01:28:46,887
No, I mean, how are we
going to handle it?

1381
01:28:46,889 --> 01:28:49,489
Well we've got heavy gloves,
and we've got goggles.

1382
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:52,592
No... radioactive particles
will pass through those

1383
01:28:52,594 --> 01:28:54,861
as easy as anything else,
including your skin.

1384
01:28:54,863 --> 01:28:57,397
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I think we need suits.

1385
01:28:57,399 --> 01:28:59,533
They'll be pretty bulky,
but we only need to wear them

1386
01:28:59,535 --> 01:29:01,401
when the powder's
out in the open.

1387
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:04,104
When do we need them by?

1388
01:29:04,106 --> 01:29:06,106
Well, we've just been
waiting for the explosive.

1389
01:29:06,108 --> 01:29:10,444
If you can get the tatp,
Sunday is our day.

1390
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:16,650
You guys remember
Timothy McVeigh's last words?

1391
01:29:16,652 --> 01:29:18,885
Yeah, he read<i> invictus.</i>

1392
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:24,725
"It matters not
how strait the gait,

1393
01:29:24,727 --> 01:29:27,728
how charged
with punishments the scroll,

1394
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:34,735
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul."

1395
01:29:40,609 --> 01:29:42,876
Are you sure
this is gonna look right?

1396
01:29:43,845 --> 01:29:45,946
Wow. It looks great.

1397
01:29:45,948 --> 01:29:48,615
The secret is the smell.
Where's the bleach powder?

1398
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:50,117
Oh, it's right over here.

1399
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:55,589
And you're sure they're not
gonna try and test this somehow?

1400
01:29:55,591 --> 01:29:57,657
Yeah, that's why
terrorists love tatp.

1401
01:29:57,659 --> 01:29:59,793
You can't identify it
without a mass spectrometer.

1402
01:29:59,795 --> 01:30:01,128
Okay, if you say so.

1403
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:04,097
Yeah. Uh-huh, yeah,
I'm here now.

1404
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:09,503
Sunday, so team's in place
Friday night.

1405
01:30:09,505 --> 01:30:10,804
Look, can I just say

1406
01:30:10,806 --> 01:30:13,006
I'm sorry about what
i said to you the other day.

1407
01:30:13,008 --> 01:30:15,041
I was exhausted.

1408
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:18,512
Don't worry about it.

1409
01:30:18,514 --> 01:30:20,147
That's what this job
does to you.

1410
01:30:20,149 --> 01:30:21,815
Keep at it another ten years

1411
01:30:21,817 --> 01:30:26,052
and you'll turn into
a real asshole... like me.

1412
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:31,191
It's totally secure.

1413
01:30:31,193 --> 01:30:33,760
We can keep everything in here,
and then, on game day,

1414
01:30:33,762 --> 01:30:36,563
we can use this space
to put it all together.

1415
01:30:36,565 --> 01:30:39,633
Great, great.
This is great, Nate.

1416
01:30:39,635 --> 01:30:43,570
And here is...

1417
01:30:45,139 --> 01:30:47,140
...the tatp.

1418
01:30:47,142 --> 01:30:52,579
- No problems, inquiries?
- Nope. All good.

1419
01:30:56,584 --> 01:30:58,618
Morgan's a pharmacist.

1420
01:31:00,888 --> 01:31:02,823
All right.

1421
01:31:07,595 --> 01:31:11,898
Hm, these crystals
seem a little small.

1422
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:15,569
Smells about right.
Okay, let's test it.

1423
01:31:15,571 --> 01:31:19,072
Test it? You got a mass
spectrometer in your bag?

1424
01:31:19,074 --> 01:31:20,740
No, we'll just see if it burns.

1425
01:31:20,742 --> 01:31:22,843
What? No, whoa, whoa!
Hold on, what do you mean?

1426
01:31:22,845 --> 01:31:24,711
Burn it?
What are you talking about?

1427
01:31:24,713 --> 01:31:28,014
Well, we use a sample,
we set it a light.

1428
01:31:28,016 --> 01:31:30,851
It burns for a while
before it explodes.
I saw it on YouTube.

1429
01:31:30,853 --> 01:31:33,119
Are you insane? Do you know
how dangerous this stuff is?

1430
01:31:33,121 --> 01:31:34,855
Hey, you are not
the only one with experience!

1431
01:31:34,857 --> 01:31:36,890
This is a highly
unstable substance, okay?

1432
01:31:36,892 --> 01:31:38,825
It's sensitive
to heat, friction--

1433
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:40,727
which is why
I'll do the test carefully!

1434
01:31:40,729 --> 01:31:42,963
Now you want to see the video?
Because I have it here
on my phone!

1435
01:31:42,965 --> 01:31:44,564
I don't give a shit
about what's on your phone!

1436
01:31:44,566 --> 01:31:46,233
We are not
lighting this stuff on fire!

1437
01:31:46,235 --> 01:31:48,969
You know how many bomb techs
i saw get their faces blown off

1438
01:31:48,971 --> 01:31:50,504
trying to deal
with this stuff in Iraq?

1439
01:31:50,506 --> 01:31:52,572
I've worked with this company
for two years!

1440
01:31:52,574 --> 01:31:54,841
They are not gonna send me
a container full of baking soda,
okay?

1441
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:57,677
Gerry, this doesn't
work for me, okay, if he doesn't
trust me, or my suppliers--

1442
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,613
we need to test
the fucking stuff!

1443
01:31:59,615 --> 01:32:01,181
You don't fucking
trust me or my suppliers,
that is your problem!

1444
01:32:01,183 --> 01:32:03,049
You want to use
ammonium nitrate, fine with me!

1445
01:32:03,051 --> 01:32:04,818
- Okay.
- Fine with me.

1446
01:32:04,820 --> 01:32:06,653
Nate, Nate, Nate.
It's all right.

1447
01:32:06,655 --> 01:32:09,956
It's fine, it's fine.
Morgan, Morgan, he's right.

1448
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:12,192
Come on. He's right.

1449
01:32:15,796 --> 01:32:18,031
So, can we see the suits?

1450
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:21,034
And it's kind of
hard with the gloves,

1451
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:24,604
but... and you zip that up
and fasten along there.

1452
01:32:24,606 --> 01:32:28,008
You guys, what would be worse,
radiation poisoning

1453
01:32:28,010 --> 01:32:30,744
or wearing this thing
around for a couple hours?

1454
01:32:31,112 --> 01:32:32,579
Yeah.

1455
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:42,289
<i> So if you ever have any doubt</i>

1456
01:32:42,291 --> 01:32:45,892
<i>white men created civilization,</i>
<i> just go have a look.</i>

1457
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:52,232
<i> How do you reason</i>
<i> with someone like that?</i>

1458
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:55,669
<i> How can you ever hope</i>
<i> to change their mind?</i>

1459
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:15,221
<i> Hello?</i>

1460
01:33:15,223 --> 01:33:18,158
Hey, hey, listen,
something's wrong.

1461
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:18,158
David drove to Frederick county

1462
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:21,328
<i> early this morning</i>
<i> and went to a farm supply.</i>

1463
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:23,063
<i> It looks like he bought</i>
<i> ammonium nitrate.</i>

1464
01:33:23,065 --> 01:33:24,631
And now they're all at Gerry's.

1465
01:33:24,633 --> 01:33:25,899
But it's Saturday?

1466
01:33:25,901 --> 01:33:27,734
And why do they need
ammonium nitrate?

1467
01:33:27,736 --> 01:33:29,369
I don't know. Me and Hernandez
are heading over

1468
01:33:29,371 --> 01:33:30,904
to meet the surveillance team
at Gerry's now.

1469
01:33:30,906 --> 01:33:32,806
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know!

1470
01:33:32,808 --> 01:33:34,641
No! No!
You can not raid them yet!

1471
01:33:34,643 --> 01:33:36,142
You don't even know
if they have the cesium?

1472
01:33:36,144 --> 01:33:38,244
And Gerry's phone's off.
Okay, I have to go over there.

1473
01:33:38,246 --> 01:33:39,813
<i> No, Nate! It--</i>

1474
01:33:41,082 --> 01:33:43,383
Nate...
...Come here!

1475
01:33:49,323 --> 01:33:51,992
- What are you doing here?
- I was calling, you didn't
answer. I got worried.

1476
01:33:51,994 --> 01:33:54,127
- Bullshit! Why are you here?
- I just told you!

1477
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:56,096
I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

1478
01:33:56,098 --> 01:33:57,764
Okay, what the fuck
is wrong with this guy?

1479
01:33:57,766 --> 01:33:59,332
I called three times,
you didn't answer any of them!

1480
01:33:59,334 --> 01:34:01,735
I got worried
something happened to you!

1481
01:34:03,771 --> 01:34:05,372
All right, put it down!
He's telling the truth!

1482
01:34:05,374 --> 01:34:06,873
- Were you followed?
- - No, I wasn't!

1483
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:08,308
- Are you sure?
- Yes! I was worried,

1484
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:11,044
so I was checking constantly!

1485
01:34:11,046 --> 01:34:13,146
Okay, calm down,
everybody calm down.

1486
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:15,782
Okay, can somebody tell me
what is going on?

1487
01:34:15,784 --> 01:34:18,718
I sent David to do surveillance
on your shop last night.

1488
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:21,421
I saw an electrical crew go into
the building across the street.

1489
01:34:21,423 --> 01:34:23,923
- So?
- In the middle of the night?

1490
01:34:23,925 --> 01:34:25,291
Could there be like
a power problem?

1491
01:34:25,293 --> 01:34:28,261
No, they must have
traced the tatp you ordered.

1492
01:34:28,263 --> 01:34:30,296
- Okay, if they're
on to the shop...
- Fuck.

1493
01:34:30,298 --> 01:34:31,731
...they're on to you.

1494
01:34:31,733 --> 01:34:33,033
Are you sure
you weren't followed?

1495
01:34:33,035 --> 01:34:34,434
- Yes!
- If he said he wasn't,
he wasn't!

1496
01:34:34,436 --> 01:34:36,670
Stay calm
and keep your eyes open.

1497
01:34:36,672 --> 01:34:38,938
Morgan, get back to work,
please, Jesus.

1498
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:40,407
We had to move forward,
immediately.

1499
01:34:40,409 --> 01:34:41,975
It would have been
only a matter of time

1500
01:34:41,977 --> 01:34:43,276
before they were on to us, too.

1501
01:34:43,278 --> 01:34:44,444
And you weren't
gonna let me know?

1502
01:34:44,446 --> 01:34:47,414
Nate, I'm sorry. It's too risky.

1503
01:34:47,416 --> 01:34:49,349
Well, he's here now,
let's get him to help!

1504
01:34:49,351 --> 01:34:51,317
What about the tatp?

1505
01:34:51,319 --> 01:34:54,020
David got
ammonium nitrate instead.

1506
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:57,123
He used his name,
so the jig is up.

1507
01:34:57,125 --> 01:34:58,792
They'll know it's us.

1508
01:34:58,794 --> 01:35:00,894
It's not gonna matter tomorrow.

1509
01:35:00,896 --> 01:35:02,729
We're in this
to the end now, Nate.

1510
01:35:02,731 --> 01:35:07,233
Do you understand?
They're not gonna take us alive.

1511
01:35:08,969 --> 01:35:10,470
All right, let me help.

1512
01:35:10,472 --> 01:35:14,207
Okay, okay, good.
Come over here.

1513
01:35:20,081 --> 01:35:23,717
I should go wash up
so I don't contaminate anything.

1514
01:35:27,755 --> 01:35:28,988
Oh...

1515
01:35:28,990 --> 01:35:30,890
Hey, Nate! How are you?

1516
01:35:38,299 --> 01:35:40,033
- Nate!
- The cesium is here!

1517
01:35:40,035 --> 01:35:41,768
All right, everyone!
Let's get ready to do this!

1518
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:43,937
No! Angela,
you have to tell him to wait.

1519
01:35:43,939 --> 01:35:45,939
Wait? No, no, no,
we need to get in there now!

1520
01:35:45,941 --> 01:35:48,208
There are three guys
in there with machine guns
and they're building a bomb.

1521
01:35:48,210 --> 01:35:50,243
This is a residential
neighborhood. His wife and kids
are in the house.

1522
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:52,178
<i> If you come in here now,</i>
<i> it'll be a blood bath.</i>

1523
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:53,847
This is a volatile situation.

1524
01:35:53,849 --> 01:35:55,482
Yeah, which is why
we need to move now...

1525
01:35:55,484 --> 01:35:57,751
No, he doesn't get it!
These guys are fanatics!

1526
01:35:57,753 --> 01:35:59,119
They will not be taken alive!

1527
01:35:59,121 --> 01:36:00,820
Tom, you're not in there!
We have to listen to him.

1528
01:36:00,822 --> 01:36:02,388
And what the fuck happens
if the explosives go off

1529
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:02,388
<i> while we're waiting around?</i>

1530
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:05,825
<i> Nate, you got 60 seconds</i>
<i> to disarm those guys,</i>

1531
01:36:05,827 --> 01:36:07,293
<i> because we're coming in.</i>

1532
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:11,498
Okay, let's get
these suits ready.

1533
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:15,468
Okay, let's get ready to move!
We are almost done here!

1534
01:37:10,357 --> 01:37:12,325
Fuck! The cesium spilled!

1535
01:37:13,461 --> 01:37:15,962
Shit, get the suits on!
Go, go, go!

1536
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:22,936
Come on!

1537
01:37:28,610 --> 01:37:31,477
Come on, help me!
Help me!

1538
01:37:31,479 --> 01:37:33,613
Get zipped up!
Get zipped up!

1539
01:37:34,481 --> 01:37:37,150
Son of a...
Shit, come on!

1540
01:37:39,386 --> 01:37:43,957
- Come on, get your hood on!
- No! No!

1541
01:37:45,392 --> 01:37:47,493
...stop!

1542
01:37:51,465 --> 01:37:53,299
Get the gun!

1543
01:37:58,105 --> 01:38:00,073
It's me! It's me! It's me!

1544
01:38:00,075 --> 01:38:02,375
Are you okay? You all right?

1545
01:38:04,012 --> 01:38:06,045
- You all right?
- Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good.

1546
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:08,648
I know my rights! I'm a
patriot of the United States!

1547
01:38:08,650 --> 01:38:11,417
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- Fuck you!

1548
01:38:15,056 --> 01:38:16,489
Come on, get up!

1549
01:39:03,537 --> 01:39:06,072
Surprise!

1550
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:25,425
<i> The paperwork came in...</i>
<i> Houston.</i>

1551
01:39:25,427 --> 01:39:29,295
Yeah... Texas.
Can you believe it?

1552
01:39:29,297 --> 01:39:31,230
Good margaritas, I hear.

1553
01:39:31,232 --> 01:39:32,432
Yeah.

1554
01:39:36,071 --> 01:39:39,105
Yeah, I'm gonna
miss it here, though.

1555
01:39:42,142 --> 01:39:46,179
Well, "it's"
going to miss you, too.

1556
01:39:49,216 --> 01:39:53,019
"This should have been
a noble creature;

1557
01:39:53,021 --> 01:39:55,321
he hath all the energy
which would have made

1558
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:58,257
a goodly frame
of glorious elements,

1559
01:39:58,259 --> 01:40:01,094
had they been wisely mingled."

1560
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:05,365
Gerry?

1561
01:40:07,167 --> 01:40:10,269
Yeah, Gerry,
and all of them, really.

1562
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:16,776
Yeah, that's why you were
the right guy for the job.

1563
01:40:18,112 --> 01:40:19,545
What do you mean?

1564
01:40:19,547 --> 01:40:22,015
Why do you think I picked you?

1565
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:28,187
I knew that you
would understand them.

1566
01:40:29,423 --> 01:40:32,058
And they'd understand you.

1567
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:34,227
And the more authentic
you became with them,

1568
01:40:34,229 --> 01:40:36,496
the more authentic
they'd become with you.

1569
01:40:40,267 --> 01:40:43,102
Because when it
comes down to it,

1570
01:40:43,104 --> 01:40:49,375
there really is only one
essential ingredient to fascism.

1571
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:52,378
<i> It's victimhood.</i>

1572
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:57,250
I blamed those black kids,

1573
01:40:57,252 --> 01:41:00,086
and I blamed this school,

1574
01:41:00,088 --> 01:41:05,124
I blamed the cops;
I blamed everybody.

1575
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:11,597
I was gonna hurt everyone else
the way they hurt me.

1576
01:41:11,599 --> 01:41:16,335
I look at you guys
and I see myself.

1577
01:41:17,704 --> 01:41:21,707
But you guys don't have to make
the same mistakes I did.

1578
01:41:23,277 --> 01:41:25,812
You don't have to be victims.

1579
01:41:32,519 --> 01:41:33,719
Hey.

1580
01:41:33,721 --> 01:41:35,721
- Hey.
- Hey.

1581
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:37,824
That was great.

1582
01:41:37,826 --> 01:41:42,628
Thanks. Dude, thanks...

1583
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:45,131
Thanks for coming by.

1584
01:41:46,233 --> 01:41:48,534
I'm so proud of you, Johnny.

1585
01:41:51,438 --> 01:41:52,872
You know what they say...

1586
01:41:55,776 --> 01:41:58,177
It all begins with the word.
