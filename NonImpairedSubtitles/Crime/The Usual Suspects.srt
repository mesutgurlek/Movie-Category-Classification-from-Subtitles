1
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:34,524
How you doing, Keaton?

2
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:39,864
I can't feel my legs...

3
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:43,801
Keyser.

4
00:03:47,974 --> 00:03:49,271
Ready?

5
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:02,286
What time is it?

6
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:04,817
12:30.

7
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:13,358
It all started back in New York
six weeks ago.

8
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:17,088
A truck loaded with stripped gun parts
got jacked outside of Queens.

9
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:19,597
The driver didn't see anyone,
but someone fucked up.

10
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,294
He heard a voice.
Sometimes that's all you need.

11
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:30,376
- Mr.McManus?
- Christ! Don't you fucking guys ever sleep?

12
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:33,675
- We have a warrant for your arrest.
- Fuck you, pig.

13
00:05:41,454 --> 00:05:42,921
Todd Hockney?

14
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:46,521
- Who wants to know?
- New York Police Department.

15
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:52,928
- Shit.
- Freeze!

16
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:54,330
Hold it!

17
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:01,102
Sure you brought enough guys?

18
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:38,036
It's quite simple:

19
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:42,980
A restaurant that changes with the taste
without losing the overall aesthetic.

20
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:44,277
In other words...

21
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:47,444
...the atmosphere will not
be painted on the walls.

22
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:52,619
- Let me give you an example--
- This I had to see for myself.

23
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:56,250
David.

24
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,599
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

25
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:03,133
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

26
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:06,234
Special Agent Kujan. US Customs.

27
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:10,100
These gentlemen
are from the New York Police Department.

28
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:13,144
You look good.
Better than I would have thought.

29
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:18,108
A small matter of a stolen truck
loaded with guns.

30
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:22,152
Mr.Keaton?

31
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:24,787
Will you excuse us for a moment?

32
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,791
We have some questions
to ask you downtown. You'll be a while.

33
00:07:31,364 --> 00:07:33,832
No. Please, sit down.

34
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,394
This is a small problem.

35
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:41,535
Enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later.

36
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:05,927
It didn't make sense that I'd be there.

37
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:08,729
These guys were hard-core hijackers...

38
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:10,731
...but there I was.

39
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:15,331
At that point, I wasn't scared.

40
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:18,343
I knew I hadn't done anything
they could do me for.

41
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:21,008
Besides, it was fun.

42
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:23,948
I got to make like I was notorious.

43
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:26,442
You all know the drill.

44
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,218
When your number is called, step forward
and repeat the phrase you've been given.

45
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:33,626
Number 1, step forward.

46
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:41,292
"Hand me the keys
you fucking cocksucker."

47
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:45,004
Number 2, step forward.

48
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:51,503
Gimme the fuckin' keys,
you fuckin' cocksucker motherfucker!

49
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:55,241
Knock it off. Get back.
Number 3, step forward.

50
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:07,785
- "Hand me the keys, you cocksucker."
- In English, please.

51
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:10,894
- Excuse me?
- In English.

52
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:14,633
Hand me the fuckin' keys, you cocksucker.
What the fuck?

53
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:16,635
Number 4, step forward.

54
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,668
It was bullshit.
The whole rap was a setup.

55
00:09:19,873 --> 00:09:22,933
"Hand me the keys
you fucking cocksucker."

56
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:24,767
It was the cops' fault.

57
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:27,904
You don't put guys like that
into a room together.

58
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:30,106
Who knows what can happen?

59
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:33,649
"Hand me the keys
you fucking cocksucker."

60
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:37,854
This has really got to be embarrassing
for you guys.

61
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:39,185
They drilled us all night.

62
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:42,524
Someone was mad about that truck
hijacking and the cops had nothing.

63
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:45,860
They were hoping somebody would slip up
and give them something.

64
00:09:45,932 --> 00:09:48,867
They knew we wouldn't fight,
they knew how to lean on us.

65
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:52,063
They've been doing it forever.
Our rights went out the window.

66
00:09:52,138 --> 00:09:54,038
It was a violation. Disgraceful.

67
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:56,940
They went after McManus first.
Topnotch entry man.

68
00:09:57,043 --> 00:09:58,442
What truck?

69
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:01,939
- The truck with the guns, fucko.
- "Fucko"?

70
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:07,416
He was a good guy. Crazy, though.

71
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,580
Wanna know what your pal
Fenster told us?

72
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:11,385
- Say who?
- McManus.

73
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:13,186
He told us another story.

74
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:16,987
Is that the one about
the hooker with the dysentery?

75
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:20,257
Fenster always worked with McManus.
He was a real tight-ass.

76
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,598
But when it came to the job,
he was right on. A smart man.

77
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,366
- What are you saying?
- I said he'll flip you.

78
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:29,408
- He'll what?
- Flip you. Flip you for real.

79
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:31,841
- I'm shaking. Come on.
- Okay.

80
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:34,937
- Answer my questions.
- Can you hear me in the back?

81
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:37,039
Hello?

82
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:39,244
I want my lawyer.

83
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:42,145
I'm gonna have
your fuckin' badge, cocksucker.

84
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:45,046
Todd Hockney: good with explosives.

85
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:49,120
Without a doubt, the one guy
who didn't give a fuck about anybody.

86
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:51,753
You guys don't have
a fuckin' leg to stand on.

87
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:53,093
You think so, tough guy?

88
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,691
I can put you in Queens
during the hijacking.

89
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:56,962
Really?

90
00:10:57,236 --> 00:10:58,703
I live in Queens.

91
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:01,171
Did you put that
together yourself, Einstein?

92
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,834
You got a team of monkeys
working full time on this?

93
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,243
You know what happens
if you do another turn in the joint?

94
00:11:08,715 --> 00:11:11,309
I fuck your father in the shower,
and have a snack.

95
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:14,717
- Are you gonna charge me, dickhead?
- I'll charge you when I'm ready.

96
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:17,585
- With what?
- You know damn well, dead man.

97
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:18,681
But Keaton?

98
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:21,420
Keaton was the real prize for them
for obvious reasons.

99
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:24,223
It was your mistake, not mine.

100
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:28,992
Did you ever stop to ask me?

101
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:34,564
I've been walking around
with the same face, the same name.

102
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:37,442
I'm a businessman.

103
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,671
What's that? The restaurant business?

104
00:11:39,746 --> 00:11:43,648
No. From now on you're in the
"getting fucked by us" business.

105
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:46,150
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.

106
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:47,811
Like I said...

107
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:50,214
...it was your mistake...

108
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,823
...not mine.

109
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,623
You charge me with this shit...

110
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:57,559
...and I'll beat it.

111
00:11:58,498 --> 00:11:59,522
Okay?

112
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:03,330
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

113
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:07,864
Really, somebody's got to do something
about this shit.

114
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,341
They put me in holding every five minutes.
So I did a little time.

115
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:15,871
Does that mean I get railed every time
a truck finds it's way gone?

116
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:17,210
Fuck 'em.

117
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,550
Fenster, will you relax?

118
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:24,084
- These guys don't have any probable cause.
- You fuckin' right. No PC.

119
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:27,615
You're goddamn right.
You do some time, never let you go.

120
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:30,184
They treat me like a criminal.

121
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,226
- I'll end up a criminal.
- You are a criminal.

122
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:37,269
Why'd you got to go and do that?

123
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,097
- I'm trying to make a point.
- Why don't you make your point?

124
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:43,369
You're making me tired all over.

125
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:44,567
Fuck it then.

126
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:47,439
- I heard you were dead.
- Yeah?

127
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,749
- You heard right.
- Word I got is you hung up your spurs.

128
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:54,284
- What's that all about?
- What's this?

129
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:59,149
Rumor has it Keaton's gone straight.
I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.

130
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:00,249
Who's that?

131
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,951
She's a heavyweight criminal
lawyer from uptown.

132
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:04,963
I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

133
00:13:05,164 --> 00:13:06,961
How 'bout it, Keaton?

134
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,861
You a lawyer's wife?

135
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:11,570
What kind of retainer you giving her?

136
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:17,106
Do your friend a favor...

137
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:19,573
...tell him to keep quiet.

138
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,070
Dean Keaton...

139
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:25,141
Gone clean?

140
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:27,243
Say it ain't so.

141
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:30,852
- Or was it you that hit that truck?
- Mac, forget him.

142
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,420
Did you get to talk to your lawyer?

143
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,991
This whole thing was a shakedown.

144
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:39,787
- What makes you say that?
- How many times you been in a lineup?

145
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:43,128
It's always you and four dummies.

146
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:46,467
The PD are paying homeless guys
$10 a head half the time.

147
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:49,936
There's no way they'd line
five felons in the same row.

148
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:53,872
What's a voice lineup?
Public defender could get you out of that.

149
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:57,438
- Why the hell was I strip searched?
- It was the feds.

150
00:13:57,683 --> 00:14:00,015
A truckload of guns gets snagged.

151
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:03,852
Customs comes down on NYPD
for answers. They come up with us.

152
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,218
- They're clutching at straws.
- I had a guy's finger up my ass.

153
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:08,655
Is it Friday already?

154
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:11,990
Yeah, lover boy.

155
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:15,225
You want a piece? Jump in. I'll love you.

156
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:19,097
So who in the goddamn piss hell
stole our fucking truck?

157
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:23,066
- What did you say?
- Who stole the fucking truck?

158
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:26,270
- I don't want to know.
- Who asked you, workingman?

159
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:29,075
Fuck who did it.
What I want to know is, who's the gimp?

160
00:14:29,148 --> 00:14:31,412
- He's okay.
- Says you. How do I know that?

161
00:14:31,484 --> 00:14:33,577
What about it, pretzel man?
What's your story?

162
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:34,950
His name is Verbal.

163
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:37,019
Verbal Kint.

164
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:38,579
- Verbal?
- Yeah.

165
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:41,786
Roger, really. People say I talk too much.

166
00:14:42,028 --> 00:14:43,928
I was going to tell you to shut up.

167
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:47,725
- We met before, once or twice.
- In County. I was in for fraud.

168
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,064
You were in a lineup then, too.
What happened?

169
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:53,069
I walked. 90 days, suspended.

170
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:56,136
- So you did it.
- All right, now look...

171
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,274
...we've all been put out
by this whole thing, right?

172
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:04,177
I figure we owe it to ourselves
to salvage a little dignity.

173
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:07,949
Now, me and Fenster
heard about a little job.

174
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:09,884
Why don't you just calm down?

175
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:12,290
What do you care what he has to say?

176
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:15,224
I'm just talking here.

177
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:18,721
It seems to me like Mr.Hockney
wants to hear it...

178
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:20,789
...and I know Fenster's down.

179
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:23,397
What about you, guy?

180
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,135
I'm interested.

181
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:28,600
There. See?

182
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:32,001
I'd like to exercise my right
to free assembly.

183
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:34,042
Why don't you just shut up?

184
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,677
You're missing the point.

185
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:43,413
No.

186
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:46,491
You're missing the point.

187
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:49,126
I don't want to hear anything from you.

188
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:51,686
I don't care about your job.

189
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:54,658
And...

190
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:59,361
...I want nothing to do with any of you.

191
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,036
I beg your pardon,
but you can all go to hell.

192
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:07,008
Dean Keaton...

193
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,270
...gone the high road.

194
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:12,909
What is the world coming to?

195
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:19,185
Fuck him.

196
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:25,557
And that was how it started:

197
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:28,031
Five of us brought in
on a trumped-up charge...

198
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,068
...to be leaned on by half-wits.

199
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:35,840
I really can't talk about it much here.

200
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:39,503
What the cops never figured out,
and what I know now...

201
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:42,843
...was that these men would never break,
never lie down.

202
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:45,842
Never bend over for anybody.

203
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:48,080
Anybody.

204
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:07,233
- Who are you?
- Agent Jack Baer, FBI.

205
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:09,565
- How many dead?
- 15 so far.

206
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:12,440
They're still pulling bodies
out of the water.

207
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:14,546
- Any survivors?
- Two.

208
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:17,411
One guy's in County hospital,
but he's in a coma.

209
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:20,577
The DA has a second guy,
a cripple from New York.

210
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:23,019
The chief wants this place sealed off.

211
00:17:23,122 --> 00:17:25,955
If you have any questions, give him a call.

212
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,358
This is Dave Kujan.
I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.

213
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:07,660
If you need to reach me, contact Jeff Rabin
of the San Pedro Police Department...

214
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:10,566
...at extension 112. Have a nice day.

215
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,901
- Why can't I see him?
- I told you...

216
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:19,968
...the DA came down here
last night ready to arraign...

217
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:22,104
...even before they moved him to County.

218
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:24,547
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later...

219
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:28,144
...the DA comes out looking like
the bogeyman smacked him around.

220
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,348
They take his statement,
and they cut him a deal.

221
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:35,451
- Did they charge him with anything?
- Weapons, misdemeanor 2.

222
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:37,295
What is that?

223
00:18:37,863 --> 00:18:41,458
I give the DA credit for getting that much,
you understand?

224
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:43,058
Excuse me, sir.

225
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:48,229
This whole thing has turned political.
The mayor was here last night.

226
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:51,640
The chief. This morning,
the governor called, okay?

227
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,908
I'm telling you, this guy is protected
from up on high by the Prince of Darkness.

228
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:58,415
- Take my word for it.
- When does he post bail?

229
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:00,714
- Maybe two hours, tops.
- I want to see him.

230
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:02,651
- No.
- I gotta see him.

231
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:05,383
- No. I can't--
- You gotta do this for me.

232
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,688
I came a long way for this.

233
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,827
Dave, please.

234
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:16,199
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk to you.

235
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,501
He's paranoid about being recorded.

236
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:22,166
- He knows the rooms are wired.
- I quit.

237
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:25,210
This won't be an interrogation,
just a friendly chat.

238
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:28,505
- He won't go into the interrogation room.
- Then someplace else.

239
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:29,741
Where?

240
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:33,012
No, no.

241
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:36,948
If this was a dope deal, where's the dope?
If it was a hit, who called it?

242
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:40,514
I'm sure you have a host of wild theories
to answer all these questions.

243
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:43,960
- You know what I think.
- That's crazy, and it doesn't even matter.

244
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:46,896
The guy's got total immunity.
His story checks out.

245
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:51,431
- He doesn't know what you want to know.
- I don't think he does, not exactly.

246
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,432
But there's a lot more to his story,
believe me.

247
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:58,436
I wanna know why
27 men died on that pier...

248
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:02,811
...for what looks to be $91 million
worth of dope that wasn't there.

249
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:06,484
And above all,
I want to be sure Dean Keaton's dead.

250
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:08,248
He's dead.

251
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:11,680
Come on. Two hours.
Just till he makes bail.

252
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:13,490
They're all dead.

253
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,857
I don't care how tough
you say Keaton was...

254
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:18,829
...nobody on that boat
could've come out alive.

255
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:25,059
- Is he talking?
- He regained consciousness an hour ago.

256
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:27,571
He spoke, not English, then he lapsed.

257
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,140
- Hungarian?
- That might have been it.

258
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:33,110
- Most of them were Hungarians.
- You gotta put this on.

259
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:35,840
Burn victims are very susceptible
to infection.

260
00:20:36,382 --> 00:20:38,850
And, of course, there's no smoking.

261
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:51,189
Keep your mask up.
Please don't touch him.

262
00:20:51,263 --> 00:20:52,389
Is he gonna die?

263
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:55,126
He's burned 60 percent of his body,
broken ribs--

264
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,862
Call security. Put a man on the door.

265
00:20:57,937 --> 00:21:00,098
- Is he dangerous?
- Yes.

266
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:01,498
Do it.

267
00:21:02,074 --> 00:21:03,439
Do it now.

268
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:08,945
Joel? Baer. Down at LA County.

269
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:13,073
Look, the guy they pulled out of the harbor
is Arkosh Kovash.

270
00:21:13,218 --> 00:21:14,981
Yes, I'm sure.

271
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:17,182
No, he's all fucked up.

272
00:21:19,024 --> 00:21:20,651
I can't hear you.

273
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:23,352
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.

274
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:24,987
Yes.

275
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:27,865
No, not till I put a man on him.

276
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,366
Send me someone
who can speak Hungarian.

277
00:21:30,502 --> 00:21:33,232
He's awake.
He's talking like a Thai hooker.

278
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:34,670
Keyser Soze.

279
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:38,206
- What?
- Keyser Soze!

280
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:44,343
No shit?

281
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:48,616
Call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice...

282
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:51,218
...and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

283
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:28,556
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.

284
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:30,828
Nice to meet you.

285
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:33,488
He wants to ask you a few questions
before you go.

286
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:37,023
- What about?
- About a Dean Keaton, mostly.

287
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,738
I'd like to start at the lineup
back in New York.

288
00:22:40,806 --> 00:22:44,139
- Can I get some coffee?
- In a while. Let's talk about the lineup.

289
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:47,608
I'm really thirsty.
I used to dehydrate as a kid.

290
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,046
Once I got so bad
my piss come out like snot.

291
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:53,141
- It was all thick and gooey--
- I'll get your fucking coffee.

292
00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:55,778
Get me one, too, while you're at it.

293
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:01,887
That guy is tense.

294
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:03,788
Tension is a killer.

295
00:23:03,896 --> 00:23:06,865
I used to be in a barbershop quartet
in Skokie, Illinois.

296
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:09,867
The baritone was this guy
named Kip Diskin, big fat guy.

297
00:23:09,968 --> 00:23:12,596
Like, orca fat.
He was so stressed in the morning--

298
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:16,630
- You know we're trying to help you.
- Sure, and I appreciate that.

299
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:19,837
And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan.
I like cops.

300
00:23:19,912 --> 00:23:22,506
I would've liked to have been a fed,
but my CP--

301
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:26,540
You're not tellin' us everything.
I know you know something.

302
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:28,753
I told the DA everything I know.

303
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:33,056
I know you like Keaton.

304
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:37,284
- I know you think he's a good man.
- I know he was good.

305
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:38,795
He was a corrupt cop.

306
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:41,594
Sure. 15 years ago,
but he was a good thief.

307
00:23:42,434 --> 00:23:44,299
The cops wouldn't let him go legit.

308
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:46,496
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

309
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:52,305
Are you trying to get a rise out of me?

310
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:56,205
- I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.

311
00:23:57,116 --> 00:23:58,879
May I have a cigarette?

312
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:04,988
- According to your statement--
- I need a light.

313
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:11,324
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator...

314
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:13,023
...run-of-the-mill--

315
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:20,896
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator...

316
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,198
...run-of-the-mill scams.

317
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:26,039
It's been suppressed.
Anything in there is inadmissible.

318
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:29,410
I know. Sweet deal you have here.
Total immunity.

319
00:24:31,683 --> 00:24:36,086
I do have the weapons charge.
I'm lookin' at six whole months hard time.

320
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:38,214
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer?

321
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:41,785
You know a religious guy
named John Paul?

322
00:24:41,994 --> 00:24:44,963
- You know Ruby's in Attica?
- He didn't have my lawyer.

323
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,930
I know Ruby. He's big on respect.

324
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:49,490
He's a good friend of mine,
likes me very much.

325
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:52,537
I know your testimony is sealed.
Ruby's well connected.

326
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:55,300
He's got lots of friends inside
who do favors for him.

327
00:24:55,374 --> 00:24:59,208
What would he say if he found out
you dropped his name to the DA?

328
00:24:59,545 --> 00:25:03,003
- There's nothing there on Ruby.
- I'll be sure to mention that to him.

329
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:06,141
Know what I've learned on the job?
How to spot a murderer.

330
00:25:06,218 --> 00:25:08,584
Say you arrest three guys
for the same killing.

331
00:25:08,654 --> 00:25:10,121
Put them in jail overnight.

332
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:12,521
Next morning,
whoever's sleeping is your man.

333
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:16,220
If you're guilty, you know you're caught.
You let your guard down.

334
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:18,523
- You follow me?
- No.

335
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:20,264
Let me get to the point.

336
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:26,262
I'm smarter than you,
and I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.

337
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:28,636
I'll get it, whether you like it or not.

338
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:31,332
I'm not a rat.

339
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:38,910
Thanks.

340
00:25:43,255 --> 00:25:47,021
When I was pickin' beans in Guatemala
we used to make fresh coffee.

341
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:50,152
Right off the trees, I mean. That was good.

342
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:54,097
- This is shit, but I'm in a police station.
- Can we get started again?

343
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,396
What happened after the lineup?

344
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:05,299
The desk sergeant was telling me
he couldn't release you.

345
00:26:05,377 --> 00:26:08,505
Can you believe that?
You weren't even charged.

346
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,979
Damn police.

347
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:15,142
I wanna have pictures taken of your face.

348
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,314
- I'll take them to the DA tomorrow.
- Forget about it.

349
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,154
I'll have this thing in front
of a grand jury by Monday.

350
00:26:21,226 --> 00:26:23,160
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

351
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:27,962
What did Fortier and Renault say?

352
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:31,127
They asked for more time
to think about investing.

353
00:26:31,203 --> 00:26:32,295
Damn it.

354
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:33,998
More time for what?

355
00:26:34,473 --> 00:26:37,931
No matter how you cover my tracks
they're still gonna find out about me.

356
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:40,172
Give me some credit.

357
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:42,744
I got you this far.
Let's go to the grand jury.

358
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:46,910
- This isn't gonna stop if we don't--
- It's never going to stop, period.

359
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:51,717
By next week, every investor in the city
is gonna be walking away from us.

360
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:54,656
It's finished.

361
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:56,360
I'm finished.

362
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,195
Don't give up on me now.

363
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:08,206
It's never gonna stop.

364
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,845
I love you.

365
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:20,214
They ruined me in there tonight.

366
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,585
I love you.

367
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,316
Do you hear me?

368
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:34,624
What?

369
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:38,566
All right.

370
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:41,662
Let's just go to my place.

371
00:27:56,989 --> 00:27:58,980
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

372
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:04,653
Let's go.

373
00:28:07,132 --> 00:28:09,828
Fenster and McManus
had a cagey proposition:

374
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:12,495
A fast-jump, high-risk, long money.

375
00:28:12,904 --> 00:28:14,633
We all knew it could be done.

376
00:28:14,773 --> 00:28:17,537
The way I figured,
to do it wrong meant killing.

377
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:19,804
To do it right took five men.

378
00:28:20,312 --> 00:28:22,177
Five men meant Keaton.

379
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:25,315
Keaton took convincing.

380
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:30,049
New York's finest taxi service.

381
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:32,151
Bullshit.

382
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,220
Bullshit.

383
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,485
They don't operate anymore.

384
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:41,824
McManus has a friend in the 14th precinct.
They're coming out for one job, Thursday.

385
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,835
They're pickin' up a guy
smuggling emeralds from South America.

386
00:28:44,903 --> 00:28:46,700
McManus already has a fence set up.

387
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:49,707
- A fence? Who?
- Some guy in California called Redfoot.

388
00:28:49,775 --> 00:28:52,767
- I never heard of him.
- You have to come.

389
00:28:52,844 --> 00:28:57,338
- What's it to you whether I do it or not?
- They don't know me. You do.

390
00:28:57,582 --> 00:28:59,948
They won't take me unless you go.

391
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:02,047
Look at me. I need this.

392
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:06,320
You're telling me you don't need this?
Is this your place?

393
00:29:06,758 --> 00:29:10,216
I'm not knocking you. You got
a good scam going with this lawyer.

394
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,160
Sorry.

395
00:29:17,102 --> 00:29:19,002
It's okay.

396
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:22,968
You say it's the real thing? That's cool.

397
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:26,771
You okay?

398
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:28,840
I was out of line.

399
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:32,515
But they're never gonna stop with us.
You know that.

400
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:35,314
As clean as you get,
they'll never let you go now.

401
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:39,414
This way, we hit the cops where it hurts,
and we get well in the meantime.

402
00:29:43,328 --> 00:29:44,989
You sure you're okay?

403
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:46,996
I'll be all right.

404
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:02,844
Look, I...

405
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:06,083
- ...sometimes get--
- Forget it.

406
00:30:09,488 --> 00:30:11,820
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

407
00:30:22,834 --> 00:30:24,096
So...

408
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:28,638
...how do they wanna do it?

409
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:32,838
McManus wants to go in shooting.
I say no.

410
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:36,640
Fenster? Hockney?

411
00:30:36,815 --> 00:30:39,511
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

412
00:30:39,651 --> 00:30:42,017
I got a way to do it without killing anyone.

413
00:30:42,087 --> 00:30:45,386
But like I say,
they won't let me in without you.

414
00:31:03,508 --> 00:31:04,873
$3 million?

415
00:31:06,845 --> 00:31:08,210
Maybe more.

416
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:14,216
No killing.

417
00:31:15,921 --> 00:31:17,786
Not if we do it my way.

418
00:31:51,756 --> 00:31:54,953
New York's finest taxi service
was not your normal taxi service.

419
00:31:55,026 --> 00:31:58,985
It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD
that ran a high-profit racket...

420
00:31:59,064 --> 00:32:01,555
...driving smugglers and drug dealers
all over the city.

421
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:04,295
For $300 a mile,
you got your own blue and white...

422
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:07,395
...and a police escort.
They even had their own business cards.

423
00:32:07,472 --> 00:32:11,670
After a while, somebody started asking
questions, and the taxi service shut down.

424
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:15,372
Ever since then, Internal Affairs
has been waiting to catch them in the act.

425
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:17,005
That's where we came in.

426
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:20,546
- So, how was the flight?
- Fuckin' great.

427
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,820
Will this get me to Staten Island?

428
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,320
Are you kiddin' me?
This will get you to Cape Cod.

429
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:31,326
McManus came to us with the job.
Fenster got the vans.

430
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:33,023
Hockney supplied the hardware.

431
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:35,760
I came through with
how to do it so no one got killed.

432
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:39,429
But Keaton?
Keaton put on the finishing touch.

433
00:32:39,504 --> 00:32:43,133
A little "fuck you" from the five
of us to the NYPD.

434
00:32:46,444 --> 00:32:47,672
Watch this.

435
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:49,871
Careful.

436
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:51,809
Come on, asshole!

437
00:32:53,218 --> 00:32:54,549
Holy shit!

438
00:32:55,553 --> 00:32:58,681
- Don't move, you fucker!
- Drop it now, motherfucker!

439
00:32:58,757 --> 00:33:00,816
Drop the fuckin' gun! Drop it!

440
00:33:00,892 --> 00:33:02,917
Don't fuckin' touch a fuckin' thing.

441
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:05,622
- What do you guys want?
- Put your fuckin' thing away.

442
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,721
We're cops! Stupid assholes!

443
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:10,492
- Watch the glass!
- Don't fuckin' move, motherfucker!

444
00:33:11,036 --> 00:33:13,834
- You want a buckshot shampoo, chubby?
- Shut up!

445
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:17,807
Fuck.

446
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:22,841
'Afternoon, my little pork chops.
Give me the shit.

447
00:33:22,914 --> 00:33:24,575
- Don't move!
- Give him the shit!

448
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:26,640
Give him the fuckin' thing!

449
00:33:26,718 --> 00:33:28,549
Give him the fuckin' shit, man!

450
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,947
Hurry up! Come on!

451
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:33,289
- Now the money!
- There's no money.

452
00:33:33,358 --> 00:33:36,327
- Give me the money now!
- There's no fuckin' money.

453
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:38,019
Give him the fuckin' money!

454
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:40,797
- Do it! Give him the money!
- Give me the money!

455
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:43,263
- Give him the money!
- Hurry up!

456
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:46,228
You know who the fuck I am?

457
00:33:46,438 --> 00:33:49,100
You people know
who the fuck I am? Fuck!

458
00:33:49,774 --> 00:33:51,503
We do now, jerk-off.

459
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,607
Cocksucker.

460
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,418
Wait a minute. What's that?

461
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:03,911
What the fuck?

462
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:05,819
Holy shit!

463
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:09,517
Go!

464
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:24,498
Keaton made an anonymous phone call.

465
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:27,136
The press was on the scene
before the police were.

466
00:34:27,212 --> 00:34:29,680
Strausz and Rizzi
were indicted three days later.

467
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:32,581
Within a few weeks,
50 more cops went down with them.

468
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:36,580
Everybody got it right in the ass,
from the chief on down.

469
00:34:36,654 --> 00:34:38,281
It was beautiful.

470
00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:47,988
I owe you $2.50.

471
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:50,932
Dr.Keaton.

472
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:57,266
- There's more here than I thought.
- When's the fence coming?

473
00:34:57,642 --> 00:35:00,236
Redfoot never comes to see me.
I always go to see him.

474
00:35:01,646 --> 00:35:03,136
In California?

475
00:35:04,215 --> 00:35:07,048
Yes, Verbal, in California. Fenster and I--

476
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:11,179
Wait, hold the fuckin' phone.
You and Fenster? No.

477
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:15,423
- You fuckin' kiddin' me?
- So then, who's gonna go?

478
00:35:16,261 --> 00:35:17,592
We all go.

479
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,628
What's your fuckin' problem, man?

480
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:25,302
My problem, is you and Fenster
honeymooning in California...

481
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,464
...while the rest of us are sittin' here
holding our dicks.

482
00:35:28,673 --> 00:35:30,197
The job's over.

483
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:31,936
Cool it.

484
00:35:32,677 --> 00:35:35,237
LA's a good place to lay low for a while.

485
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:39,381
You wanna dance?

486
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:48,152
Ladies.

487
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:57,934
I would like to propose a toast.

488
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:00,894
There you go.

489
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:04,965
To Mr.Verbal...

490
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:08,646
...the man with the plan.

491
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:23,388
We're gonna miss the flight.

492
00:36:24,462 --> 00:36:27,556
Don't do this.
Send her a note. Something.

493
00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:30,163
I said we'll make it.

494
00:37:04,002 --> 00:37:06,197
We're gonna miss the plane.

495
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:09,099
She'll understand.

496
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,652
That's heartwarming. Really.

497
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:34,595
I'm weepy.

498
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:37,758
You wanna wait outside?

499
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:44,137
You guys wanted to know what happened.
I'm telling you.

500
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,698
Come on, Verbal.

501
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:50,745
Who do you think you're talkin' to?
You expect me to believe that he retired?

502
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:53,148
For a woman?

503
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:57,613
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

504
00:37:58,256 --> 00:38:00,349
- He loved her.
- Sure.

505
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:03,883
I'm supposed to believe that hitting
the taxi service wasn't his idea.

506
00:38:03,962 --> 00:38:07,728
- It was all Fenster and McManus.
- Keaton was a cop for four years.

507
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:09,699
Who else would know better?

508
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:12,565
- That job had his name on it.
- Edie had him turned around.

509
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:14,801
Let me tell you something.

510
00:38:14,872 --> 00:38:16,533
I know Dean Keaton.

511
00:38:16,608 --> 00:38:19,406
I've been investigating him
for the past three years.

512
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:22,071
The guy I know
was a cold-blooded bastard.

513
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,678
IAD indicted him on three counts of
murder before he was kicked off the force.

514
00:38:26,751 --> 00:38:29,049
Don't sell me the hooker
with a heart of gold.

515
00:38:29,187 --> 00:38:30,677
You got him all wrong.

516
00:38:31,823 --> 00:38:32,915
Do I?

517
00:38:33,524 --> 00:38:37,824
Dean Keaton was under indictment
seven times while he was on the force.

518
00:38:37,962 --> 00:38:41,454
In every case,
witnesses either reversed their testimony...

519
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:44,433
...or died before they could testify.

520
00:38:45,136 --> 00:38:49,505
When they finally did nail him for fraud,
he spent five years in Sing Sing.

521
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:51,675
He killed three prisoners inside.

522
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,405
Of course, I can't prove this...

523
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,308
...but I can't prove the best part either.

524
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:01,380
Dean Keaton was dead.

525
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,646
Did you know that?

526
00:39:03,921 --> 00:39:07,652
He died in a fire two years ago,
during an investigation into the murder...

527
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:10,819
...of a witness who was going
to testify against him.

528
00:39:10,995 --> 00:39:13,987
Two people saw Dean Keaton
walk into a warehouse he owned...

529
00:39:14,065 --> 00:39:15,828
...just before it blew up.

530
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,328
They said he went in
to check a leaking gas main.

531
00:39:20,071 --> 00:39:23,131
It blew up and took all
of Dean Keaton with it.

532
00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:29,304
Within three months of the explosion,
the two witnesses, they were dead.

533
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:31,873
One killed himself in his car.

534
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,916
The other fell down an open elevator shaft.

535
00:39:38,222 --> 00:39:40,190
Let's get this show on the road.

536
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:42,988
This is not what we discussed.
There are too many--

537
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:45,825
I promise we'll be out
before he blows his porch light.

538
00:39:45,897 --> 00:39:48,331
- I have a noon meeting.
- Five minutes.

539
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:50,299
Everyone calm down, all right?

540
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:53,701
I want you to ask this man
about the shootout in the harbor.

541
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:08,483
- He says they were buying--
- Dope. We know.

542
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:17,126
He doesn't know
what they were buying, but not dope.

543
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:19,558
- People.
- What?

544
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:29,235
He needs guarantees...

545
00:40:29,574 --> 00:40:33,510
- What is he talking about, guarantees?
- He says his life is in danger.

546
00:40:33,878 --> 00:40:35,641
He saw the Devil.

547
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,672
Looked him in the eye.

548
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:40,343
- I'm on my way.
- No, wait a minute.

549
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:42,909
Ask him to tell him what he told me...

550
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:45,450
...about the Devil.

551
00:40:45,823 --> 00:40:47,450
Who's the Devil?

552
00:40:52,663 --> 00:40:54,062
Keyser Soze.

553
00:40:59,036 --> 00:41:00,367
Keyser Soze?

554
00:41:00,471 --> 00:41:03,269
He was in the harbor, killing many men.

555
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:05,804
He saw Keyser Soze?

556
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,641
- He saw his face.
- All right.

557
00:41:14,986 --> 00:41:17,682
Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

558
00:41:18,055 --> 00:41:19,579
Describe him.

559
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,624
Six weeks ago,
I get an anonymous phone call...

560
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:32,726
...telling me I can find Keaton
eating at Mondino's, and there he is.

561
00:41:33,538 --> 00:41:36,530
Because he never profited
from his alleged death...

562
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:40,199
...and we convicted someone else
of the murder we tried to pin on him...

563
00:41:40,411 --> 00:41:42,208
...we had to let him go.

564
00:41:42,814 --> 00:41:46,079
He was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over.

565
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:47,878
And then he had lunch.

566
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,253
I don't know about that.

567
00:41:50,488 --> 00:41:54,015
I don't think you do,
but you say you saw Keaton die.

568
00:41:54,725 --> 00:41:57,819
I think you're covering his ass,
and he's still out there.

569
00:41:57,895 --> 00:42:00,227
I think he's behind
that circus at the harbor.

570
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:03,825
My bet is he's using you because
you're stupid and think he's your friend.

571
00:42:03,901 --> 00:42:06,199
You tell me he's dead, so be it.

572
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:09,402
I wanna be sure
before I go back to New York.

573
00:42:09,473 --> 00:42:12,408
He wasn't behind anything.
It was the lawyer.

574
00:42:12,944 --> 00:42:14,343
What lawyer?

575
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:16,237
What lawyer?

576
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:19,044
Back when I was in
that barbershop quartet--

577
00:42:19,116 --> 00:42:21,550
You don't think I know you held out
on the DA?

578
00:42:21,752 --> 00:42:23,276
What did you leave out?

579
00:42:23,354 --> 00:42:25,618
I could be on the phone
to Ruby in 10 minutes.

580
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,352
- The DA gave me immunity.
- Not from me.

581
00:42:28,492 --> 00:42:30,960
You get no immunity from me,
you piece of shit.

582
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:34,520
Every criminal I have put in prison,
every cop that owes me a favor...

583
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:37,224
...every creep and scumbag
that walks the street...

584
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:39,997
...will know the name of Verbal Kint.
You talk to me...

585
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:42,562
...or that precious immunity
they grant you...

586
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,940
...won't be worth the paper the contract
put out on your life is printed on.

587
00:42:49,046 --> 00:42:50,775
There was a lawyer.

588
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,414
Kobayashi.

589
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:58,854
- Is he the one that killed Keaton?
- No, but I'm sure Keaton is dead.

590
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:01,255
Convince me.

591
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:04,188
Tell me every last detail.

592
00:43:23,547 --> 00:43:26,983
We arrived in Los Angeles
and met McManus' fence, Redfoot.

593
00:43:27,952 --> 00:43:31,581
He had a good reputation.
Seemed like a good guy.

594
00:43:31,822 --> 00:43:34,814
- Still, we should have known better.
- How you doing?

595
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:37,918
- Good. You?
- Not bad. Can't complain.

596
00:43:38,863 --> 00:43:40,763
How's it going, Fenster?

597
00:43:41,632 --> 00:43:43,759
Don't need to open it, right?

598
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,369
You must be Keaton.

599
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,207
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.

600
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:58,471
- Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.
- Verbal, the man with the plan.

601
00:43:59,317 --> 00:44:00,841
You interested in more work?

602
00:44:01,752 --> 00:44:04,687
- We're always looking for extra work.
- We're on vacation.

603
00:44:06,257 --> 00:44:07,690
That's too bad.

604
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:10,254
I got a ton of work and no good people.

605
00:44:10,695 --> 00:44:12,629
- Not like you guys.
- What's the job?

606
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,760
There's this jeweler
out of Texas named Saul.

607
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:17,926
He rents a suite in some downtown hotel.

608
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:21,636
He does free appraisals.
Sometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't.

609
00:44:21,973 --> 00:44:24,498
The word is,
he carries around a lot of cash.

610
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:29,302
So I figure, I keep the merchandise,
you keep the green.

611
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,112
- Simple.
- What about security?

612
00:44:32,183 --> 00:44:35,516
A couple of bodyguards.
Nothing you couldn't handle.

613
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,551
Give me time to check it out?

614
00:44:37,922 --> 00:44:40,083
I expect nothing less from you, man.

615
00:44:41,425 --> 00:44:43,484
Good to see you. We'll call you.

616
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:45,961
Enjoy LA. Get yourself laid.

617
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:55,362
A friend in New York tells me
that you knew Spook Hollis.

618
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,400
The way I hear it,
you did time with ol' Spook.

619
00:44:59,543 --> 00:45:01,340
A good man, wasn't he?

620
00:45:01,746 --> 00:45:03,771
I used to run dope for him.

621
00:45:04,415 --> 00:45:06,508
Too bad he got shivved.

622
00:45:08,552 --> 00:45:09,712
I shivved him.

623
00:45:12,289 --> 00:45:15,816
Better you hear it from me now
than from somebody else later.

624
00:45:17,294 --> 00:45:18,955
I appreciate that.

625
00:45:19,964 --> 00:45:21,829
But just out of curiosity...

626
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,062
...was it business or personal?

627
00:45:27,505 --> 00:45:28,995
A bit of both.

628
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:32,202
Like I said...

629
00:45:32,576 --> 00:45:35,443
...you give me a call if you're interested.

630
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:41,312
Is there a problem?

631
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,214
One job.

632
00:45:44,722 --> 00:45:46,349
That was the deal.

633
00:45:51,629 --> 00:45:52,857
One job?

634
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,128
One job?

635
00:45:58,836 --> 00:46:00,770
That's a good one.

636
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,532
Keaton fought it as best he could,
but a man can't change what he is.

637
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:09,804
He can convince anyone he's someone else,
but never himself.

638
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,509
It took one day with McManus nagging,
and we went back to work.

639
00:46:28,232 --> 00:46:30,792
I get out of my car,
and the thing is wrecked.

640
00:46:30,868 --> 00:46:34,360
I look in the backseat of the other car,
and this woman's totally naked.

641
00:46:34,438 --> 00:46:37,532
- I'm laughin' so hard I can't breathe.
- Get in the car, Saul.

642
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:40,403
- Freeze, motherfucker!
- Stay right there!

643
00:46:42,346 --> 00:46:44,280
There's a second one here, somewhere.

644
00:46:48,018 --> 00:46:51,249
Gimme the case. Give me the fuckin' case!

645
00:46:57,428 --> 00:47:00,864
Give me the fuckin' case.
I'm tellin' you for the last time.

646
00:47:01,098 --> 00:47:02,861
Give me the fuckin' case!

647
00:47:07,338 --> 00:47:09,863
- Come on!
- Don't move!

648
00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:46,936
Hand over the case.

649
00:47:48,078 --> 00:47:50,103
Hand over the fuckin' case.

650
00:48:14,104 --> 00:48:15,765
Come on, let's go!

651
00:48:16,407 --> 00:48:18,967
- Come on!
- Bad day. Fuck it.

652
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,200
Let's go!

653
00:48:45,436 --> 00:48:46,528
Fuck.

654
00:48:49,673 --> 00:48:53,370
- Looks like a lot of china to me.
- Shit.

655
00:48:58,682 --> 00:49:00,172
Guys, come on.

656
00:49:01,485 --> 00:49:03,976
- What are you doin'?
- I'm gonna kill him.

657
00:49:04,054 --> 00:49:06,181
We did it your way, now we'll do it mine.

658
00:49:06,257 --> 00:49:08,418
- You gonna kill him?
- I'll deal with him.

659
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:11,359
- You'd better, or I'm gonna.
- Shut up.

660
00:49:18,736 --> 00:49:21,170
What am I supposed to do with that?

661
00:49:21,472 --> 00:49:24,600
Feed it to the gimp. Ease his pain.
I don't know what that is.

662
00:49:24,675 --> 00:49:26,700
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

663
00:49:26,944 --> 00:49:29,071
I got thrown this job by some lawyer.

664
00:49:29,146 --> 00:49:30,135
Who?

665
00:49:30,381 --> 00:49:32,406
I don't know. Some limey.

666
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:36,212
He's a middleman for somebody.
He doesn't say, I don't ask.

667
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:38,585
- You're fuckin' full of shit!
- Fuck you.

668
00:49:38,656 --> 00:49:40,351
- Fuck you.
- Listen to me.

669
00:49:40,758 --> 00:49:42,749
We wanna meet him, okay?

670
00:49:43,093 --> 00:49:44,560
That's funny.

671
00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:48,924
He called me last night.
He says he wants to meet you guys.

672
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,500
Okay, we'll meet him.

673
00:49:51,902 --> 00:49:53,802
- I'll call you.
- Good. Let's go.

674
00:49:53,871 --> 00:49:57,238
I don't like it. Wait a minute.
One more thing, tough guy:

675
00:49:57,775 --> 00:50:00,505
Any more surprises, and I'm gonna kill you.

676
00:50:01,912 --> 00:50:04,938
You're such a tough guy.
But do me a favor, all right?

677
00:50:05,015 --> 00:50:07,176
Get the fuck off my dick.

678
00:50:07,618 --> 00:50:09,017
No!

679
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,951
Put a leash on that puppy.

680
00:50:14,058 --> 00:50:17,323
It's an awful shame
about Saul gettin' whacked.

681
00:50:17,995 --> 00:50:20,156
Cops'll be lookin' for the guys who did it.

682
00:50:21,231 --> 00:50:23,859
Sooner or later,
they're gonna come around askin' me.

683
00:50:26,303 --> 00:50:28,533
You have a sweet night, ladies.

684
00:50:32,343 --> 00:50:33,605
Fuck you.

685
00:50:39,983 --> 00:50:42,884
- So this lawyer--
- Kobayashi.

686
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,952
- Came from Redfoot.
- Right.

687
00:50:46,357 --> 00:50:49,190
And why leave this out
when you talked to the DA?

688
00:50:49,293 --> 00:50:51,261
Dave, someone to see you.

689
00:50:56,667 --> 00:50:58,760
I've been looking all over for you.

690
00:50:58,836 --> 00:51:02,465
You still after that coke that took a walk
out of that bloodbath yesterday?

691
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:05,337
You can stop looking. There was no coke.

692
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:09,072
I've been in LA County talking to a guy
they pulled out of a drainpipe...

693
00:51:09,146 --> 00:51:10,909
...yesterday after the shootout.

694
00:51:10,981 --> 00:51:13,176
He came to this morning,
he started talking.

695
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,515
He's part of a Hungarian mob.
They dealt with gwats from Argentina.

696
00:51:16,587 --> 00:51:19,147
He says it was definitely not a dope deal.

697
00:51:19,223 --> 00:51:22,522
- But there were--
- We know. But he says no on the dope.

698
00:51:22,593 --> 00:51:26,120
This Hungarian tells me they were
pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.

699
00:51:26,196 --> 00:51:29,791
They had no time for that kind of product,
and no means to move it.

700
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:31,858
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know.

701
00:51:32,202 --> 00:51:35,194
No one doing the deal knew
except for a few key people.

702
00:51:35,272 --> 00:51:37,570
They were all very hush about it, he says.

703
00:51:37,741 --> 00:51:41,973
- Whatever it was, it was very sensitive.
- I don't get it.

704
00:51:42,045 --> 00:51:44,309
You got the cripple in there
from New York?

705
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:45,973
Did he mention Keyser Soze?

706
00:51:46,216 --> 00:51:47,581
Who?

707
00:51:48,118 --> 00:51:50,018
Just bear with me here.

708
00:51:51,455 --> 00:51:54,219
- Who's Keyser Soze?
- Fuck!

709
00:51:55,259 --> 00:51:58,456
We've been goin' over this
for an hour and a half.

710
00:51:58,896 --> 00:52:02,798
What we need to do is find Redfoot
and get the hell out of here now.

711
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:04,834
What we need to do is think.

712
00:52:05,135 --> 00:52:06,500
Think back.

713
00:52:07,638 --> 00:52:10,402
Somebody with power...

714
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:14,104
...somebody capable of tracking us
from New York to LA.

715
00:52:14,178 --> 00:52:17,272
- What the hell are we doing here?
- We're waiting.

716
00:52:17,848 --> 00:52:21,716
- Sit down.
- No. I'm hot, and I'm fuckin' bored.

717
00:52:21,785 --> 00:52:23,582
Mr.Hockney, do stay.

718
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:25,686
Mr.Keaton.

719
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:28,387
Mr.Fenster I recognize
from his mug shots...

720
00:52:28,459 --> 00:52:30,290
...as well as Mr.McManus.

721
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:35,354
I can only assume that you are Mr.Kint,
the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

722
00:52:35,432 --> 00:52:39,129
My employer sends his gratitude,
a most unexpected benefit.

723
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:42,031
I am Mr.Kobayashi.

724
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:46,938
I have been asked by my employer
to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.

725
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:50,104
- What do you want?
- My employer requires your services.

726
00:52:52,282 --> 00:52:55,809
One job, one day's work. Very dangerous.

727
00:52:56,019 --> 00:52:59,477
He does not expect all of you to live.
But those of you who do...

728
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:03,683
...will have $91 million to divide
between you in any way you see fit.

729
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,352
Who's your boss?

730
00:53:07,598 --> 00:53:09,225
I work for Keyser Soze.

731
00:53:20,577 --> 00:53:21,805
Who's Keyser Soze?

732
00:53:21,879 --> 00:53:24,279
Judging by the sudden change in mood...

733
00:53:24,414 --> 00:53:27,383
...I feel sure the rest
of your associates can tell you.

734
00:53:27,584 --> 00:53:30,451
I come with an offer
directly from Mr.Soze.

735
00:53:30,754 --> 00:53:34,451
- An order, actually.
- What do you mean, "an order"?

736
00:53:34,658 --> 00:53:39,618
In 1981, you participated in the hijacking
of a truck in Buffalo, New York.

737
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:43,859
The cargo was raw steel,
steel which belonged to Mr.Soze...

738
00:53:43,934 --> 00:53:48,030
...and which was destined for Pakistan
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

739
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:51,399
A most profitable violation
of UN Regulations.

740
00:53:51,475 --> 00:53:53,534
You had no way of knowing this...

741
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,773
...because the fellow shipping the steel
was working for Soze...

742
00:53:56,847 --> 00:53:58,405
...without his knowledge.

743
00:53:58,749 --> 00:54:01,445
Earlier this year,
Mr.Fenster and Mr.McManus...

744
00:54:01,518 --> 00:54:05,284
...hijacked a two-prop cargo flight
out of Newark airport.

745
00:54:05,355 --> 00:54:09,621
The plane was carrying gold and platinum
wiring also set for Pakistan.

746
00:54:10,227 --> 00:54:13,719
Two months ago,
Mr.Hockney stole a truck...

747
00:54:13,797 --> 00:54:16,322
...carrying gun parts through Queens.

748
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,029
Gun parts which were set to be destroyed
by the state of New York.

749
00:54:20,237 --> 00:54:24,071
They were to be lost in a way station
and rerouted to Belfast.

750
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:27,110
Again, Mr.Soze using pawns
who had no knowledge.

751
00:54:27,477 --> 00:54:29,638
Which brings us to Mr.Kint.

752
00:54:30,814 --> 00:54:33,374
Nine months ago, one of Mr.Soze's...

753
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:38,012
...less than intelligent couriers was taken
in a complicated confidence scam...

754
00:54:38,755 --> 00:54:40,188
...by a cripple.

755
00:54:40,557 --> 00:54:42,855
He was relieved of $62,000.

756
00:54:43,694 --> 00:54:46,527
Now, it has taken us
some time to find you.

757
00:54:46,997 --> 00:54:50,831
Our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in New York.

758
00:54:51,034 --> 00:54:52,399
You set up the lineup.

759
00:54:52,469 --> 00:54:55,700
Yes. You were not to be released
until I had come to see you.

760
00:54:55,772 --> 00:54:58,605
It seems Mr.Keaton's attorney,
Miss Finneran...

761
00:54:58,976 --> 00:55:02,503
...was a little too effective
in expediting his release.

762
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:04,774
Holding the rest of you
became a moot point.

763
00:55:05,082 --> 00:55:07,778
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr.Redfoot knew nothing.

764
00:55:07,951 --> 00:55:10,579
Mr.Soze rarely works
with the same people for long...

765
00:55:10,654 --> 00:55:13,418
...and they never know
who they're working for.

766
00:55:13,557 --> 00:55:16,458
One cannot be betrayed
if one has no people.

767
00:55:17,461 --> 00:55:19,486
So, why are you telling us?

768
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:24,060
Because you have stolen from Mr.Soze,
Mr.Fenster.

769
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:25,359
All of you.

770
00:55:25,435 --> 00:55:29,098
That you did not know it
is the only reason you're still alive.

771
00:55:29,706 --> 00:55:33,369
He feels you owe him.
You will repay your debt.

772
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:37,644
Fuck the debt, and fuck you.
How do we know you work for Soze?

773
00:55:38,115 --> 00:55:40,675
I don't think that is very relevant.

774
00:55:40,851 --> 00:55:44,014
All five of you are responsible
for the murder of Saul Berg...

775
00:55:44,087 --> 00:55:45,452
...and his bodyguards.

776
00:55:45,722 --> 00:55:48,282
Mr.Redfoot can testify
to your involvement.

777
00:55:48,358 --> 00:55:50,292
We can see to it that he will.

778
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,420
- What's your point?
- The offer is this, gentlemen:

779
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,891
Mr.Soze's primary interest...

780
00:55:56,266 --> 00:55:57,665
...is narcotics.

781
00:55:57,901 --> 00:56:00,529
He has been competing, shall we say...

782
00:56:00,604 --> 00:56:03,072
...with a group of Argentineans
for several years.

783
00:56:03,273 --> 00:56:06,106
Competing with Mr.Soze has taken its toll.

784
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:09,504
These Argentineans
are negotiating the sale...

785
00:56:09,579 --> 00:56:13,447
...of $91 million in cocaine
in three days time.

786
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:16,617
Needless to say,
this purchase will revitalize...

787
00:56:16,687 --> 00:56:19,451
...the diminishing strength
of their organization.

788
00:56:20,257 --> 00:56:23,522
Mr.Soze would like you to stop the deal.

789
00:56:24,728 --> 00:56:27,458
If you choose,
you may wait until after the buy.

790
00:56:27,531 --> 00:56:30,125
Whatever money changes hands is yours.

791
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:35,802
Mr.Soze would like you to get to the boat
and destroy the cocaine onboard.

792
00:56:36,506 --> 00:56:40,465
And then you will be free
of your obligations to Mr.Soze.

793
00:56:42,779 --> 00:56:46,408
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right now.

794
00:56:48,385 --> 00:56:50,979
A gift from Mr.Soze.

795
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:55,954
Good day, gentlemen.

796
00:58:04,795 --> 00:58:08,390
They got my whole life in here,
everything I've done since I was 18.

797
00:58:08,665 --> 00:58:10,724
They fuckin' know everything.

798
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:13,665
Everybody I've ever worked with
or did time with.

799
00:58:28,151 --> 00:58:29,175
No.

800
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:33,685
- This isn't right.
- I don't know.

801
00:58:33,757 --> 00:58:36,851
Who's that guy who used
to talk about Soze in New York?

802
00:58:38,528 --> 00:58:42,692
- Bricks Marlin.
- He did jobs for him, indirect stuff.

803
00:58:43,266 --> 00:58:47,032
He said he always made five times
more money on it than the job was worth.

804
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:49,366
This guy's a pipe dream.

805
00:58:49,439 --> 00:58:51,600
Kobayashi's using him
for window dressing.

806
00:58:52,142 --> 00:58:53,769
I don't know. This is bad.

807
00:58:54,277 --> 00:58:58,008
It's bullshit. This guy could be LAPD.
It's a fuckin' setup.

808
00:58:59,015 --> 00:59:01,882
The way I hear it,
Soze's some kind of butcher.

809
00:59:02,252 --> 00:59:06,484
- A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher.
- There is no Keyser Soze!

810
00:59:09,292 --> 00:59:10,850
Who is Keyser Soze?

811
00:59:12,028 --> 00:59:15,896
He's supposed to be Turkish.
Some say his father was German.

812
00:59:15,966 --> 00:59:17,991
Nobody ever believed he was real.

813
00:59:18,268 --> 00:59:21,396
Nobody knew him or saw anybody
that ever worked directly for him.

814
00:59:21,504 --> 00:59:24,530
To hear Kobayashi tell it,
anybody could have worked for Soze.

815
00:59:24,641 --> 00:59:27,701
You never knew. That was his power.

816
00:59:28,511 --> 00:59:31,412
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...

817
00:59:31,948 --> 00:59:34,849
...was convincing the world he didn't exist.

818
00:59:36,286 --> 00:59:38,982
One story the guys told me,
the story I believe...

819
00:59:39,055 --> 00:59:40,750
...was from his days in Turkey.

820
00:59:40,824 --> 00:59:43,759
There was a gang of Hungarians
that wanted their own mob.

821
00:59:43,827 --> 00:59:47,228
They realized that to be in power,
you didn't need guns...

822
00:59:47,297 --> 00:59:48,855
...or money or even numbers.

823
00:59:48,932 --> 00:59:52,390
You just needed the will
to do what the other guy wouldn't.

824
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:56,170
After a while they come into power,
and then they come after Soze.

825
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:59,538
He was small-time then.
Just running dope, they say.

826
01:00:01,811 --> 01:00:03,210
They come to his home...

827
01:00:03,613 --> 01:00:06,207
...in the afternoon looking for his business.

828
01:00:06,283 --> 01:00:10,549
They find his wife and kids in the house,
and decide to wait for Soze.

829
01:00:26,336 --> 01:00:30,602
He comes home to find his wife raped
and children screaming.

830
01:00:30,674 --> 01:00:34,075
The Hungarians knew Soze was tough,
not to be trifled with.

831
01:00:34,144 --> 01:00:35,873
They let him know they meant business.

832
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,504
No!

833
01:00:41,351 --> 01:00:44,843
They tell him they want his territory,
all his business.

834
01:00:45,221 --> 01:00:48,782
Soze looks over the faces of his family.

835
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:54,118
Then he showed these men
of will what will really was.

836
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:16,619
He tells them he would
rather see his family dead...

837
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:19,352
...than live another day after this.

838
01:01:20,824 --> 01:01:22,951
He lets the last Hungarian go...

839
01:01:23,193 --> 01:01:27,129
...waits until his family is in the ground,
and goes after the rest of the mob.

840
01:01:27,564 --> 01:01:30,192
He kills their kids, he kills their wives...

841
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,530
...he kills their parents and their friends.

842
01:01:33,069 --> 01:01:35,299
He burns down the houses they live in...

843
01:01:36,406 --> 01:01:38,169
...and the stores they work in.

844
01:01:38,675 --> 01:01:42,202
He kills people that owe them money.
And like that...

845
01:01:43,546 --> 01:01:45,343
...he's gone, underground.

846
01:01:45,415 --> 01:01:48,009
Nobody's ever seen him since.
He becomes a myth.

847
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:51,247
A spook story that criminals
tell their kids at night.

848
01:01:51,321 --> 01:01:54,415
"Rat on your pop,
and Keyser Soze will get you."

849
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:57,349
No one ever really believes.

850
01:01:57,594 --> 01:01:59,619
Do you believe in him?

851
01:02:02,165 --> 01:02:03,894
Keaton always said:

852
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:07,536
"I don't believe in God,
but I'm afraid of him."

853
01:02:09,506 --> 01:02:11,406
I believe in God.

854
01:02:11,775 --> 01:02:15,802
And the only thing that scares me
is Keyser Soze.

855
01:02:22,685 --> 01:02:24,710
You give any weight to this?

856
01:02:24,788 --> 01:02:27,256
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser
from Justice.

857
01:02:27,323 --> 01:02:30,986
He's got a file on Soze in DC.
It's been a hobby of his for a while.

858
01:02:31,094 --> 01:02:34,495
A lot of guys equate him to that reporter
on The Incredible Hulk.

859
01:02:39,502 --> 01:02:40,935
You've heard of him?

860
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:42,869
Where? On the street?

861
01:02:42,939 --> 01:02:45,669
A few times. You know, outside stuff.

862
01:02:45,942 --> 01:02:49,969
Someone working for a guy who worked
for a guy who got money from Soze.

863
01:02:50,046 --> 01:02:51,638
Shit like that.

864
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,713
It could be an old badge. A hex sign.

865
01:02:54,784 --> 01:02:57,878
Keep people from fucking with you
when a name meant something.

866
01:02:57,954 --> 01:02:59,888
- But you're here.
- Shit, yeah.

867
01:03:00,123 --> 01:03:04,719
This guy's trying to walk out of a hospital
because he's so afraid of Soze.

868
01:03:05,061 --> 01:03:07,120
I'll run it up the flagpole.

869
01:03:08,565 --> 01:03:11,090
I came clean. I told it like it happened.

870
01:03:11,167 --> 01:03:12,691
So what about how I got there?

871
01:03:12,769 --> 01:03:15,932
It's so full of holes, the DA would've
told me to forget amnesty.

872
01:03:16,005 --> 01:03:18,235
You got what you wanted out of me.
Big deal.

873
01:03:18,308 --> 01:03:21,141
- That's why you never told the DA?
- You tell me.

874
01:03:21,311 --> 01:03:24,576
If I told you the Loch Ness monster
hired me, what would you say?

875
01:03:24,647 --> 01:03:26,911
Turn state's evidence.
We'll put you on the stand.

876
01:03:26,983 --> 01:03:29,474
I've got immunity.
What can you possibly offer me?

877
01:03:29,586 --> 01:03:33,181
If there really is a Keyser Soze,
he's gonna come lookin' for you.

878
01:03:33,656 --> 01:03:34,987
Where's your head?

879
01:03:35,492 --> 01:03:37,323
Where do you think the pressure is?

880
01:03:37,393 --> 01:03:40,590
Keyser Soze, or whatever you call him,
knows where I am right now.

881
01:03:40,797 --> 01:03:44,824
He has the burner on your ass to let me go
so he can scoop me up 10 minutes later.

882
01:03:45,135 --> 01:03:47,160
Immunity was just a deal
with you assholes.

883
01:03:47,237 --> 01:03:49,137
I got a new problem when I post bail.

884
01:03:49,205 --> 01:03:51,696
Why play into his hands?
We can protect you.

885
01:03:52,742 --> 01:03:56,041
Thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far.
Extortion, coercion.

886
01:03:56,112 --> 01:03:58,239
Pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker.

887
01:03:58,314 --> 01:04:01,681
The same fuckers that rounded us up
are now bailing me out?

888
01:04:01,751 --> 01:04:03,412
Fuck you.

889
01:04:05,321 --> 01:04:07,789
You think you can catch Keyser Soze?

890
01:04:07,857 --> 01:04:10,917
You think a guy like that
comes this close to getting caught...

891
01:04:10,994 --> 01:04:12,518
...and sticks his head out?

892
01:04:12,662 --> 01:04:15,426
If he comes up for anything,
it'll be to get rid of me.

893
01:04:15,765 --> 01:04:17,357
After that...

894
01:04:17,734 --> 01:04:20,760
...my guess is you'll never hear
from him again.

895
01:04:42,725 --> 01:04:44,420
What happened next?

896
01:04:44,694 --> 01:04:47,356
We woke up the next morning
and Fenster was gone.

897
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:49,955
He couldn't handle the idea
of slumming for Soze.

898
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,134
He left us a note wishing us good luck...

899
01:04:52,202 --> 01:04:54,966
...and took a chunk of the money
we'd scraped together.

900
01:04:55,071 --> 01:04:56,197
Then what?

901
01:04:56,439 --> 01:04:57,872
McManus was furious.

902
01:04:57,941 --> 01:05:02,173
He talked about tracking him down
and ripping his heart out. All sorts of shit.

903
01:05:02,946 --> 01:05:05,039
That night, we got the call.

904
01:05:05,448 --> 01:05:06,676
What call?

905
01:05:06,849 --> 01:05:09,283
Kobayashi told us where
we could find Fenster.

906
01:05:17,427 --> 01:05:19,725
Let's get the fuck out of here.

907
01:05:21,331 --> 01:05:22,855
We gotta bury him.

908
01:05:23,066 --> 01:05:24,397
With what?

909
01:05:24,834 --> 01:05:26,358
With our hands.

910
01:05:36,212 --> 01:05:37,611
This is nuts.

911
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,871
It's dry fucking sand.

912
01:05:39,949 --> 01:05:43,407
When he rots the surfers
are gonna smell him a mile away.

913
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:45,578
- Dig, you fuck.
- What are we gonna do?

914
01:05:45,655 --> 01:05:47,555
This fuckin' guy is gonna kill us.

915
01:05:47,624 --> 01:05:51,458
I don't know about you, peg leg,
but I can run. I got no problem with that.

916
01:05:52,362 --> 01:05:55,525
Kobayashi doesn't seem
to have a problem with it either.

917
01:05:56,499 --> 01:05:59,263
You run, and we're gonna be
diggin' a hole for you.

918
01:05:59,335 --> 01:06:00,802
You got that?

919
01:06:01,437 --> 01:06:04,804
This ain't my boy we're burying.
I don't owe anybody!

920
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:09,371
- So fuck you.
- He was my partner for five years.

921
01:06:09,612 --> 01:06:13,048
We did more jobs and I saw more money
than you can ever count.

922
01:06:13,116 --> 01:06:14,515
So fuck you!

923
01:06:15,151 --> 01:06:18,211
- 'Cause now it's payback!
- It's not payback!

924
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:22,589
It's precaution.

925
01:06:22,992 --> 01:06:25,961
You want payback? You wanna run?
I don't care.

926
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:31,161
I'm not doin' this for Fenster.

927
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:33,892
I'm not doin' it for you.

928
01:06:35,371 --> 01:06:37,236
I'm doin' this for me.

929
01:06:39,042 --> 01:06:40,942
I'm gonna finish this thing.

930
01:06:41,644 --> 01:06:44,841
This Kobayashi bastard
is not gonna stand on me.

931
01:07:06,035 --> 01:07:08,196
After they killed Fenster,
nobody would run?

932
01:07:08,271 --> 01:07:12,207
- I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
- Why didn't you say anything?

933
01:07:12,275 --> 01:07:14,903
Believe me, I tried,
but Keaton wouldn't have it.

934
01:07:14,977 --> 01:07:17,002
It was too far-fetched for him.

935
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,378
Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop.

936
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:22,384
To a cop, the explanation
is never that complicated.

937
01:07:22,452 --> 01:07:24,044
It's always simple.

938
01:07:24,153 --> 01:07:26,713
There's no mystery to the street,
no arch-criminal.

939
01:07:26,789 --> 01:07:30,555
You got a body and think
his brother did it, you're probably right.

940
01:07:30,626 --> 01:07:32,116
Nobody argued with Keaton.

941
01:07:32,195 --> 01:07:34,891
They just set their minds
to whacking Kobayashi.

942
01:07:44,807 --> 01:07:46,138
They're coming up.

943
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:52,040
- Did you hear me? He's coming up.
- He's on his way down.

944
01:08:48,738 --> 01:08:50,103
Don't move.

945
01:08:50,807 --> 01:08:52,536
Press 20. Do it now.

946
01:09:12,862 --> 01:09:13,954
Move.

947
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:20,233
- The answer is "no."
- Mr.Soze will be most--

948
01:09:20,303 --> 01:09:22,567
Listen, cocksucker,
there is no Keyser Soze.

949
01:09:22,638 --> 01:09:25,106
Mention his name again,
I'll kill you right now.

950
01:09:25,174 --> 01:09:29,042
A strange threat. I assume
you've come here to kill me anyway.

951
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:36,950
We know that you can get to us...

952
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:40,687
...but now you know
that we can get to you.

953
01:09:41,224 --> 01:09:44,250
I'm giving you one last
chance to call this off.

954
01:09:45,728 --> 01:09:47,719
My employer has made up his mind.

955
01:09:47,897 --> 01:09:50,957
- He does not change it.
- Neither do we.

956
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,967
You got Fenster,
but you won't be able to get all of us.

957
01:09:54,036 --> 01:09:56,334
Not before one of us gets through to you.

958
01:09:56,439 --> 01:09:59,533
I believe you. I most sincerely do.

959
01:10:00,409 --> 01:10:03,139
You would not have been chosen
were you not so suitable.

960
01:10:03,212 --> 01:10:07,171
But I cannot make this decision.
Whatever you threaten me with is...

961
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:10,083
...ludicrous in comparison
to what will be done to me...

962
01:10:10,152 --> 01:10:12,780
...if I do not carry out my orders in full.

963
01:10:20,229 --> 01:10:22,720
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

964
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,630
I just wanted you to know that.

965
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:29,561
I'm so sorry.

966
01:10:30,072 --> 01:10:32,563
I implore you, believe me...

967
01:10:32,975 --> 01:10:34,966
...Mr.Soze is very real...

968
01:10:35,344 --> 01:10:37,835
- ...and very determined.
- We'll see.

969
01:10:45,288 --> 01:10:48,655
Before you do me in...

970
01:10:49,158 --> 01:10:53,094
...you will let me finish my business
with Miss Finneran first, won't you?

971
01:10:58,067 --> 01:10:59,557
What did you say?

972
01:11:00,636 --> 01:11:02,228
Edie Finneran.

973
01:11:02,505 --> 01:11:04,530
She's upstairs in my office...

974
01:11:05,107 --> 01:11:07,302
...for an extradition deposition.

975
01:11:08,344 --> 01:11:11,177
I requested she be
put on the case personally.

976
01:11:11,247 --> 01:11:13,044
She flew in yesterday.

977
01:11:15,051 --> 01:11:16,382
No matter.

978
01:11:16,852 --> 01:11:18,717
Kill away.

979
01:11:23,559 --> 01:11:25,026
You're lying.

980
01:11:25,595 --> 01:11:26,687
Am I?

981
01:11:44,113 --> 01:11:47,742
Miss Finneran's escort
while she's here in Los Angeles.

982
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:49,478
Never leaves her for a moment.

983
01:11:49,852 --> 01:11:52,377
I thought you'd be glad to know
she's in good hands.

984
01:11:57,159 --> 01:11:59,957
Get some rest.
The boat will be ready for you on Friday.

985
01:12:00,096 --> 01:12:02,656
If I see you or any
of your friends before then...

986
01:12:02,732 --> 01:12:07,567
...Miss Finneran will be the victim of
a most gruesome violation before she dies.

987
01:12:07,703 --> 01:12:10,137
As indeed will your father, Mr.Hockney...

988
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:13,573
...and your Uncle Randall in Arizona,
Mr.Kint.

989
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:17,910
I might only castrate
Mr.McManus' nephew, David.

990
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:22,816
Do I make myself clear?

991
01:12:23,285 --> 01:12:25,753
We will take care
of the two bodies downstairs.

992
01:12:25,821 --> 01:12:28,051
We'll add them to the cost of Mr.Fenster.

993
01:12:28,924 --> 01:12:31,154
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

994
01:13:09,365 --> 01:13:11,458
It's a logistical nightmare.

995
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,364
Close quarters. 10, maybe 20 men.

996
01:13:15,004 --> 01:13:17,939
There's no tellin'
how many more are gonna be below deck.

997
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:20,271
Can we stealth these guys?

998
01:13:20,643 --> 01:13:23,840
With all that coke, they're gonna be ready.

999
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,012
Which brings me to sunny point Number 2.

1000
01:13:27,683 --> 01:13:31,210
Even if one of us gets through
and jacks the boat, we still got nothin'.

1001
01:13:31,287 --> 01:13:33,016
What if we wait for the money?

1002
01:13:33,556 --> 01:13:35,353
Ten more men at least.

1003
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:38,992
In my opinion, it can't be done.

1004
01:13:39,328 --> 01:13:41,592
Anyone who goes in
is not comin' out alive.

1005
01:13:41,664 --> 01:13:44,633
- I'm gonna wait for the money.
- Me, too.

1006
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:48,192
- Did you hear what he just said?
- If I'm goin' in, I want a cut.

1007
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:49,498
Me, too.

1008
01:13:51,006 --> 01:13:52,906
There's nothing that can't be done.

1009
01:13:56,045 --> 01:13:59,742
I just can't believe
we're gonna walk in to certain death.

1010
01:14:05,955 --> 01:14:08,583
The news said it's raining in New York.

1011
01:14:30,212 --> 01:14:31,839
What language is that?

1012
01:14:32,047 --> 01:14:35,210
I don't know. Russian, I think.

1013
01:14:37,153 --> 01:14:38,484
Hungarian?

1014
01:15:42,685 --> 01:15:45,119
The package has arrived, gentlemen.

1015
01:16:05,107 --> 01:16:06,233
You kids ready?

1016
01:16:07,142 --> 01:16:09,804
I would be if I didn't have to stop
and answer you.

1017
01:16:09,979 --> 01:16:11,276
I'm ready.

1018
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:14,381
McManus, you better be set up
in 10 seconds.

1019
01:16:16,352 --> 01:16:17,444
I'm ready.

1020
01:16:19,154 --> 01:16:20,553
I want you to stay here.

1021
01:16:21,924 --> 01:16:23,289
I'm supposed to cover--

1022
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:26,157
If we don't get out of this,
take the money and go.

1023
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:27,320
I can't--

1024
01:16:27,396 --> 01:16:29,762
Find Edie.
Tell her everything that happened.

1025
01:16:29,832 --> 01:16:31,891
She knows people. She knows what to do.

1026
01:16:31,967 --> 01:16:34,993
If I don't get Kobayashi my way,
she'll get him her way.

1027
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:37,561
- What if I--
- Just do what I say.

1028
01:16:38,207 --> 01:16:39,401
Please.

1029
01:16:42,745 --> 01:16:44,337
Tell her that...

1030
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:49,577
Tell her I tried.

1031
01:17:02,765 --> 01:17:05,256
McManus, he's on his way.

1032
01:17:05,634 --> 01:17:06,965
I'm there.

1033
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:02,820
One, two, three, four...

1034
01:18:03,459 --> 01:18:06,087
...five, six, seven...

1035
01:18:07,563 --> 01:18:09,190
Oswald was a fag.

1036
01:18:17,606 --> 01:18:18,630
Hi.

1037
01:18:19,375 --> 01:18:20,865
How you doin'?

1038
01:18:23,712 --> 01:18:26,044
Is there a problem?

1039
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:52,596
Now.

1040
01:19:22,838 --> 01:19:26,035
"Old McDonald had a farm

1041
01:19:26,108 --> 01:19:28,668
"Ee-aye, ee-aye, O

1042
01:19:29,244 --> 01:19:33,544
"And on that farm, he shot some guys"

1043
01:20:07,249 --> 01:20:08,773
Elvis has left the building.

1044
01:21:20,022 --> 01:21:22,684
Hold fire. Hold fire. Vamonos!

1045
01:21:36,338 --> 01:21:37,532
Hello.

1046
01:22:31,927 --> 01:22:33,292
Why didn't you run?

1047
01:22:34,129 --> 01:22:35,494
I froze up.

1048
01:22:36,231 --> 01:22:39,598
I thought about Fenster
and how he looked when we buried him.

1049
01:22:39,668 --> 01:22:43,764
Then I thought about Keaton,
and it looked like he might pull it off.

1050
01:22:49,911 --> 01:22:52,106
A boy found a body on the beach today.

1051
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:54,614
Thrown clear of the boat.
Shot twice in the head.

1052
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:56,617
Two guys from the Bureau identified him.

1053
01:22:56,685 --> 01:22:58,846
- What else?
- His name was Arturo Marquez.

1054
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,854
A petty smuggler from Argentina.

1055
01:23:00,922 --> 01:23:03,789
He was arrested last year in New York
for trafficking.

1056
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:07,625
He escapes to California.
They pick him up in Long Beach.

1057
01:23:07,696 --> 01:23:11,097
They're setting up extradition,
he escapes again.

1058
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:12,463
Now, get this.

1059
01:23:12,534 --> 01:23:16,163
Edie Finneran's brought in
to advise on the proceedings.

1060
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:17,500
Kobayashi.

1061
01:23:17,572 --> 01:23:19,767
New York faxed me a copy
of his testimony.

1062
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:22,401
- He was a rat.
- A big fucking rat.

1063
01:23:22,477 --> 01:23:25,241
Arturo was very opposed
to returning to prison.

1064
01:23:25,314 --> 01:23:29,216
So much so,
that he named close to 50 people.

1065
01:23:29,451 --> 01:23:31,783
Guess who he named in the finale.

1066
01:23:32,788 --> 01:23:34,187
Keyser Soze.

1067
01:23:34,523 --> 01:23:35,820
There's more.

1068
01:23:48,203 --> 01:23:52,503
I'll tell you what I know.
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

1069
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:56,105
There was no dope on that boat.

1070
01:24:37,986 --> 01:24:39,317
You, stay quiet.

1071
01:24:39,554 --> 01:24:40,885
He's here.

1072
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:45,256
I know he's here. That's him.
I'm telling you, that's him.

1073
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:47,087
I know he's here!

1074
01:24:48,697 --> 01:24:51,757
- You can't understand. That's him.
- Shut up.

1075
01:24:51,833 --> 01:24:56,202
That's him. You hear me?
I'm telling you, it's Keyser Soze!

1076
01:26:54,489 --> 01:26:56,457
- Where's Hockney?
- I don't know.

1077
01:26:56,525 --> 01:26:58,117
There's no coke.

1078
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:00,260
- What?
- You heard me, dumb fuck.

1079
01:27:00,328 --> 01:27:02,626
- There's no coke!
- What the fuck? No coke?

1080
01:27:02,697 --> 01:27:05,325
I've been up and down
in every fucking room.

1081
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,698
- There's gotta be coke!
- There is nothing!

1082
01:27:07,769 --> 01:27:08,997
Nothing!

1083
01:27:09,504 --> 01:27:10,903
Don't you fuck with me.

1084
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:14,940
There is no fucking coke!

1085
01:27:26,054 --> 01:27:27,646
I'm out of here.

1086
01:28:08,563 --> 01:28:10,326
I told them nothing.

1087
01:28:11,499 --> 01:28:12,659
I swear.

1088
01:28:13,401 --> 01:28:15,995
I told them nothing. Please.

1089
01:29:02,317 --> 01:29:05,184
What the fuck is goin' on?

1090
01:29:07,922 --> 01:29:09,685
The strangest thing.

1091
01:30:04,312 --> 01:30:07,577
That's what you said.
You saw a man in a suit with a slim build.

1092
01:30:07,649 --> 01:30:09,173
Wait a minute.

1093
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:11,275
Are you saying you saw Keyser Soze?

1094
01:30:11,352 --> 01:30:14,844
- You said you didn't know who it was.
- I know there was dope on that boat.

1095
01:30:14,923 --> 01:30:16,447
- Stop stallin'.
- I'm not.

1096
01:30:16,524 --> 01:30:19,186
- You know what I'm getting at.
- Get out of my face.

1097
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:22,093
I got immunity. I don't have to take this.

1098
01:30:22,163 --> 01:30:23,824
You know what I'm getting at.

1099
01:30:23,898 --> 01:30:26,423
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The truth!

1100
01:30:26,501 --> 01:30:28,696
Try to tell me
you saw someone kill Keaton.

1101
01:30:28,770 --> 01:30:29,794
I did.

1102
01:30:29,871 --> 01:30:31,236
You're lying to me.

1103
01:30:31,306 --> 01:30:34,764
- You've known this whole time.
- I don't know what you're saying.

1104
01:30:34,843 --> 01:30:37,471
I did see Keaton get shot. I swear to you.

1105
01:30:37,579 --> 01:30:40,139
Why didn't you help him? You had a gun.

1106
01:30:40,281 --> 01:30:42,112
He was your friend.

1107
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:47,817
Because I was afraid.

1108
01:30:50,058 --> 01:30:52,618
- Afraid.
- Afraid of what?

1109
01:30:53,795 --> 01:30:55,922
- Afraid of--
- I knew it was Keyser Soze.

1110
01:30:56,264 --> 01:31:00,166
It was Keyser Soze, I mean,
the Devil himself.

1111
01:31:01,469 --> 01:31:04,097
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?

1112
01:31:08,576 --> 01:31:10,203
What if you miss?

1113
01:31:15,316 --> 01:31:17,807
Let's get back to the pier.

1114
01:32:40,668 --> 01:32:44,069
- Arturo Marquez. Ever hear of him?
- What? No.

1115
01:32:44,205 --> 01:32:46,833
He was a stool pigeon
for the Justice Department.

1116
01:32:46,908 --> 01:32:49,274
He swore out a statement
to federal marshals...

1117
01:32:49,344 --> 01:32:52,711
...saying that he had seen
and could positively identify one...

1118
01:32:52,814 --> 01:32:54,076
...Keyser Soze.

1119
01:32:54,549 --> 01:32:56,312
It says right here in the report.

1120
01:32:56,384 --> 01:32:59,182
He had intimate knowledge
of his businesses, including...

1121
01:32:59,254 --> 01:33:02,417
...but not exclusive to,
drug trafficking and murder.

1122
01:33:02,490 --> 01:33:04,014
I never heard of him.

1123
01:33:04,092 --> 01:33:06,925
His own people were selling him
to a gang of Hungarians.

1124
01:33:06,995 --> 01:33:10,658
Most likely the same Hungarians
that Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.

1125
01:33:10,999 --> 01:33:12,660
The money wasn't there for dope.

1126
01:33:12,734 --> 01:33:15,032
The Hungarians were going
to buy the one guy...

1127
01:33:15,103 --> 01:33:17,264
...that could incriminate Keyser Soze.

1128
01:33:17,672 --> 01:33:20,140
- I said I never heard of him.
- But Keaton did.

1129
01:33:20,208 --> 01:33:23,268
Edie Finneran was Marquez's
extradition advisor.

1130
01:33:23,344 --> 01:33:25,539
She knew who he was and what he knew.

1131
01:33:25,813 --> 01:33:29,010
There were no drugs on that boat.
It was a hit.

1132
01:33:29,284 --> 01:33:31,752
A suicide mission
to whack out the one guy...

1133
01:33:31,853 --> 01:33:33,912
...that could finger Keyser Soze.

1134
01:33:34,289 --> 01:33:36,154
So Soze put some thieves to it...

1135
01:33:36,557 --> 01:33:38,923
...men he knew he could march
into certain death.

1136
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:41,785
You're saying Soze
sent us to kill someone?

1137
01:33:43,031 --> 01:33:46,057
I'm saying Keaton did.
He left you behind for a reason.

1138
01:33:46,134 --> 01:33:47,692
Just do what I tell you.

1139
01:33:47,769 --> 01:33:50,932
If you all knew that Soze
could find you anywhere...

1140
01:33:51,005 --> 01:33:52,996
...why did he give you the money to run?

1141
01:33:53,074 --> 01:33:56,373
- He could have used you on the boat.
- He wanted me to live.

1142
01:33:58,012 --> 01:34:00,640
A one-time dirty cop without
a loyalty in the world...

1143
01:34:00,715 --> 01:34:04,048
...finds it in his heart
to save a worthless rat cripple?

1144
01:34:04,118 --> 01:34:05,585
No, sir. Why?

1145
01:34:06,321 --> 01:34:07,345
Edie.

1146
01:34:07,422 --> 01:34:10,050
I don't buy that reform story for a minute.

1147
01:34:10,124 --> 01:34:11,455
Even if I did...

1148
01:34:11,526 --> 01:34:15,121
...I certainly don't believe
he would send you to protect her.

1149
01:34:15,463 --> 01:34:16,657
So why?

1150
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:20,931
Because he was my friend.

1151
01:34:21,002 --> 01:34:24,938
No, he wasn't your friend.
Keaton didn't have friends.

1152
01:34:25,006 --> 01:34:26,473
What are you doing here?

1153
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:29,271
He saved you
because he wanted it that way.

1154
01:34:29,344 --> 01:34:30,470
It was his will.

1155
01:34:31,079 --> 01:34:33,707
- Keaton was Keyser Soze.
- No.

1156
01:34:33,781 --> 01:34:37,342
A man who could wrangle the wills
of men like Hockney and McManus.

1157
01:34:37,418 --> 01:34:39,943
A man who could engineer a police lineup...

1158
01:34:40,021 --> 01:34:42,785
...through all his years of contacts in NYPD.

1159
01:34:42,857 --> 01:34:45,382
The kind of man
who could've killed Edie Finneran.

1160
01:34:50,398 --> 01:34:53,231
She was found yesterday
at a hotel in Pennsylvania...

1161
01:34:53,301 --> 01:34:55,166
...shot twice in the head.

1162
01:35:00,074 --> 01:35:02,907
What do you think about Keaton now?

1163
01:35:04,212 --> 01:35:05,201
Edie?

1164
01:35:05,279 --> 01:35:07,509
He used all of you to get him on that boat.

1165
01:35:07,582 --> 01:35:10,983
He couldn't get on alone.
He had to pull the trigger himself...

1166
01:35:11,052 --> 01:35:12,952
...to make sure he got his man...

1167
01:35:13,054 --> 01:35:15,113
...the one man that could identify him.

1168
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:17,851
This is all bullshit.

1169
01:35:18,092 --> 01:35:20,060
You said you saw him die.

1170
01:35:22,463 --> 01:35:23,487
Or did you?

1171
01:35:23,664 --> 01:35:26,030
You had to hide
when you heard the police cars.

1172
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:28,500
You said you heard the shot
before the fire...

1173
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:30,995
...but you didn't see him die.

1174
01:35:31,272 --> 01:35:34,070
- I knew him. He would never--
- He programmed you.

1175
01:35:34,142 --> 01:35:36,770
He programmed you to tell us
what he wanted you to.

1176
01:35:36,844 --> 01:35:39,074
He knew we were close.
You said it yourself.

1177
01:35:39,147 --> 01:35:42,173
Where was the political pressure
to protect you from?

1178
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:43,474
It was Keaton.

1179
01:35:43,551 --> 01:35:46,884
- Immunity was your reward.
- But why me?

1180
01:35:47,455 --> 01:35:49,548
Why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney?

1181
01:35:49,624 --> 01:35:52,320
Why me? I'm stupid.
I'm a cripple. Why me?

1182
01:35:52,393 --> 01:35:53,826
Because you're a cripple.

1183
01:35:54,362 --> 01:35:56,057
Because you're stupid.

1184
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:58,264
Because you're weaker than them.

1185
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:03,867
If he's dead...

1186
01:36:04,305 --> 01:36:08,207
If what you say is true,
then it won't matter.

1187
01:36:09,744 --> 01:36:12,611
It was his idea to hit the taxi service,
wasn't it?

1188
01:36:12,713 --> 01:36:15,876
- Come on, tell me the truth.
- It was all Keaton.

1189
01:36:17,185 --> 01:36:19,710
We followed him from the beginning.

1190
01:36:21,489 --> 01:36:22,649
I didn't know.

1191
01:36:23,157 --> 01:36:24,886
I saw him die.

1192
01:36:25,726 --> 01:36:28,718
I believe he's dead. Christ.

1193
01:36:29,964 --> 01:36:31,761
You're not safe on your own.

1194
01:36:35,870 --> 01:36:37,098
You think he's...

1195
01:36:37,405 --> 01:36:38,997
Keyser Soze?

1196
01:36:39,774 --> 01:36:41,401
I don't know.

1197
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:46,869
Keyser Soze's a shield,
or like you said, a spook story.

1198
01:36:47,949 --> 01:36:51,578
But I know Keaton, and someone
is out there pulling strings for you.

1199
01:36:52,353 --> 01:36:55,789
- Stay here and let us protect you.
- I'm not bait. I post today.

1200
01:36:56,057 --> 01:36:57,490
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1201
01:36:58,059 --> 01:37:00,118
Capt. Leo wants you out of here.

1202
01:37:00,394 --> 01:37:03,363
- Unless you turn state's.
- I'll take my chances.

1203
01:37:03,698 --> 01:37:07,395
If someone wants to get you,
they're gonna get you out there.

1204
01:37:07,468 --> 01:37:10,869
Turn state's evidence.
You might never see trial.

1205
01:37:10,938 --> 01:37:12,132
Maybe so.

1206
01:37:13,708 --> 01:37:15,608
But I'm not a rat.

1207
01:37:32,393 --> 01:37:33,951
Fuckin' cops.

1208
01:37:58,419 --> 01:38:01,013
Excuse me, can I use your fax machine?

1209
01:38:04,992 --> 01:38:07,688
You'll have to sign for these, Mr.Kint.

1210
01:38:09,830 --> 01:38:11,422
One watch, gold.

1211
01:38:11,933 --> 01:38:14,026
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1212
01:38:14,902 --> 01:38:16,893
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1213
01:38:17,505 --> 01:38:19,530
We still got nothing.

1214
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,104
I know what I wanted to know
about Keaton.

1215
01:38:22,176 --> 01:38:23,803
Which is nothing.

1216
01:38:24,312 --> 01:38:27,873
No matter.
He'll have to know how close we came.

1217
01:38:28,382 --> 01:38:30,976
Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...

1218
01:38:31,352 --> 01:38:34,287
...if Keaton is alive,
he's not comin' up again.

1219
01:38:34,722 --> 01:38:36,519
I'll find him.

1220
01:38:36,991 --> 01:38:38,481
Waste of time.

1221
01:38:41,295 --> 01:38:43,627
A rumor's not a rumor that doesn't die.

1222
01:38:44,098 --> 01:38:45,224
What?

1223
01:38:46,334 --> 01:38:47,301
Nothing.

1224
01:38:49,337 --> 01:38:51,168
Man, you're a slob.

1225
01:38:51,239 --> 01:38:53,571
But it all has a system.

1226
01:38:54,442 --> 01:38:58,879
It all makes sense if you look at it right.
You gotta stand back from it.

1227
01:39:00,181 --> 01:39:03,275
You wanna see a real horror show?
See my garage.

1228
01:39:40,621 --> 01:39:42,680
Convince me. Tell me every last...

1229
01:39:42,757 --> 01:39:45,749
When I was in that barbershop quartet
in Skokie, Illinois...

1230
01:39:45,826 --> 01:39:49,387
- Where's your head?
- We need to think, think back.

1231
01:39:49,463 --> 01:39:51,090
I'm sure you've heard tall tales.

1232
01:39:51,165 --> 01:39:52,723
- Bricks Marlin.
- This isn't right.

1233
01:39:52,833 --> 01:39:55,233
- I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.

1234
01:39:55,303 --> 01:39:58,761
- I'm tellin' it straight.
- Some guy in California called Redfoot.

1235
01:39:58,839 --> 01:40:01,330
- A gift from Mr.Soze.
- Talk to me.

1236
01:40:01,409 --> 01:40:04,469
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr.Redfoot knew nothing.

1237
01:40:04,545 --> 01:40:07,514
- Using pawns...
- A big fat guy. Like, orca fat.

1238
01:40:07,581 --> 01:40:09,310
There was a lawyer...

1239
01:40:09,684 --> 01:40:11,083
Kobayashi...

1240
01:40:11,519 --> 01:40:14,647
When I was picking beans
in Guatemala we made fresh coffee.

1241
01:40:14,789 --> 01:40:17,724
- I know you thought he was a good man.
- I know he was good.

1242
01:40:20,127 --> 01:40:23,028
- You tell me every last detail.
- The strangest thing.

1243
01:40:23,097 --> 01:40:25,031
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?

1244
01:40:25,099 --> 01:40:28,330
This guy is protected from up
on high by the Prince of...

1245
01:40:28,436 --> 01:40:30,734
What's your story, pretzel man?

1246
01:40:30,805 --> 01:40:32,636
- There was a lawyer.
- What lawyer?

1247
01:40:32,707 --> 01:40:33,867
I am Mr.Kobayashi.

1248
01:40:33,941 --> 01:40:37,468
- Kobayashi. Kobayashi.
- Tell me every last detail.

1249
01:40:37,545 --> 01:40:40,776
- I work for Keyser Soze.
- Convince me. Convince me.

1250
01:40:56,063 --> 01:40:58,691
Every creep and scumbag
that works the street...

1251
01:40:58,766 --> 01:41:00,859
...will know the name of Verbal Kint.

1252
01:41:01,502 --> 01:41:02,992
The cripple, did you see him?

1253
01:41:03,070 --> 01:41:06,164
- The cripple! Which way did he go?
- He went out that way.

1254
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:08,834
I know you know something.
I know you're not telling...

1255
01:41:08,909 --> 01:41:10,069
I'm smarter than you...

1256
01:41:10,144 --> 01:41:12,635
...and I'm gonna find out
whether you like it or not.

1257
01:41:12,713 --> 01:41:14,613
To a cop, the explanation
is never complicated.

1258
01:41:14,682 --> 01:41:16,274
- It's always simple.
- The truth!

1259
01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:19,285
There's no arch-criminal behind it all.

1260
01:41:19,353 --> 01:41:22,186
Somebody with power,
somebody who is capable...

1261
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:23,982
Keyser Soze!

1262
01:41:24,759 --> 01:41:28,024
You think a guy like that
gets this close to getting caught...

1263
01:41:28,162 --> 01:41:30,130
...and sticks his head out?

1264
01:41:31,031 --> 01:41:34,057
Because you're stupid.
Because you're a cripple.

1265
01:41:34,135 --> 01:41:36,296
What I wanna know is, who's the gimp?

1266
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:38,702
You've known the whole fuckin' time.

1267
01:41:38,773 --> 01:41:42,402
If he comes up for anything
it'll be for me. I'm sure Keaton is dead.

1268
01:41:42,476 --> 01:41:45,468
I can't feel my legs, Keyser.

1269
01:41:45,646 --> 01:41:48,046
First thing I learned on the job.
You know what?

1270
01:41:48,182 --> 01:41:51,640
- How to spot a murderer.
- You got the cripple in there?

1271
01:41:51,719 --> 01:41:54,483
- Did he mention Keyser Soze?
- Who?

1272
01:41:54,722 --> 01:41:56,246
After that...

1273
01:41:56,724 --> 01:41:59,750
...my guess is you'll never hear
from him again.

1274
01:42:20,281 --> 01:42:22,579
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...

1275
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:25,480
...was convincing the world he didn't exist.

1276
01:42:27,354 --> 01:42:28,514
And like that...

1277
01:42:30,224 --> 01:42:31,555
...he's gone.
