1
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,593
"The night was..."

2
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,711
(thunder)

3
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,432
"The night was..."

4
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,596
"The night..."

5
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,790
(grunts)

6
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,075
The Phantom of the Novel...

7
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,072
..is coming to haunt
the pages of Larry Donner.

8
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,229
Jeez, what the hell am I doing?

9
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,798
Hello, Op. Remember me?
Professor Blank?

10
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,589
We're back. Well, I'm sure
you all know the name Margaret Donner.

11
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,830
- Unless you live under a rock.
- No!

12
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,835
Ladies and gentlemen, the author
of the best-selling novel "Hot Fire".

13
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,357
- Author of the best-selling novel?
- You must be very proud of yourself.

14
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,318
- Well, l... I am.
- The woman stole my book!

15
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,392
- What's to be proud of?
-..and there's just you,...

16
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,678
..you facing you in that mirror,
do you say "Margaret, you did it"?

17
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,231
- Yes, I do.
- Slut!

18
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,118
She's a slut! Look at her! Slut!

19
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,399
- Hey! Hey, man, your wife's on TV!
- Ex-wife, Lester. Ex-wife.

20
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,439
- She looks good!
- Criminals don't age. It's a common fact.

21
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,592
- What the hell do you want?
- Something for a gig.

22
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,389
- You got anything in green?
- You borrowed all my green.

23
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,995
It is a lot more difficult for women
to get themselves published...

24
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,152
How about women thieves, Oprah?
Big difference.

25
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,835
I would say that, once I was divorced,...

26
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,717
..blissfully divorced,...

27
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,555
..a freedom overcame me, and I was
allowed to be the writer, the artist,...

28
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,236
..that I was never allowed to be within
the confines of my prison-like marriage.

29
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,676
Did you think about writing
when you were with this beast?

30
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,796
- Well, I did. I did, yes.
- (laughter)

31
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,838
Because he fancied himself
a sort of a hack writer.

32
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,596
I watched him at the typewriter and
thought: Oh, God, I can do that in spades.

33
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,999
Then did, clearly.

34
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,152
How do you think he will feel now
about your success?

35
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,069
- Frankly, I don't really care how he feels.
- (laughter)

36
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,879
- Well, Margaret...
- (applause)

37
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,677
So she stole your book.
Write another one and forget it.

38
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,591
- I am writing.
- Oh, you're writing?

39
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,148
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah, right! "The night was..."

40
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,036
- The night was what?
- I just started.

41
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,159
- You been on "The night was" since July.
- It takes place in the Yukon.

42
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,118
..severed the ties. You live in Hawaii now.

43
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,749
- Yes. I just adore a tropical climate.
- Look at those earrings, man!

44
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,831
It's your money.

45
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,791
How was it that you, Margaret Donner,...

46
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,557
..produced such a brilliant piece of
writing in... just your first time out?

47
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,032
Well, Oprah, I mean...
it's the story of my life.

48
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,078
It's my life, Margaret! And I want it back!

49
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,278
"Hot Fire", ladies and gentlemen. Thank
you so much for being on the show.

50
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,238
- My pleasure.
- I want it back!

51
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,911
- Owen!
- (thunder)

52
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,797
Owen!

53
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,877
Owen!

54
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,674
Owen! Owen!

55
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,712
- What?!
- Get me a soda with some ice in it!

56
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,032
- Owen, hurry up!
- Momma...

57
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,112
- Chop chop, Owen! Come on!
- All right!

58
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,438
- You were writing a letter!
- No, Momma!

59
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,798
You were writing to tell them to take me
away! You want them to take me away!

60
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,112
I'm writin' a story for class, Momma!
I don't want 'em to take you away!

61
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,589
- Yes, you do!
- Owen loves his momma!

62
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,671
(mimics) "Owen loves his momma."

63
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,753
(singsong) Owen loves his momma,
Owen loves his momma...

64
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,349
- Hurry up with that soda!
- Coming, Momma.

65
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,194
(mimics) "Coming, Momma."
I'm choking to death, you moron!

66
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,557
- You're too damn slow!
- I'm sorry, Momma.

67
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,995
(mimics) "I'm sorry, Momma."

68
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,675
- Where are the salted nuts?
- The salted ones are no good for you.

69
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,876
The unsalted ones make me choke!

70
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,395
Aarrghhh!

71
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,149
Momma!

72
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,794
You clumsy poop! What'd you do that for?

73
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,229
Come on, move it, lard-ass!

74
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,391
Pick up every piece!

75
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,433
"'Dive,...

76
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,796
..dive!' yelled the captain
through the thing."

77
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,038
"So the man who makes it dive pressed
a button or something and it dove,...

78
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,317
..and the enemy was foiled again."

79
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,029
"'Looks like we foiled them again'
said Dave."

80
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,315
"'Yeah' said the captain."

81
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,833
"'We foiled those bastards again,
didn't we, Dave?'"

82
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,351
"'Yeah' said Dave."

83
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,271
"The end."

84
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,117
OK.

85
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,718
Here we have all the elements of drama.

86
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,872
We have the tension, the horror of war...

87
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,159
Uh... Mrs Hazeltine, when you're writing
a novel that takes place on a submarine,...

88
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,949
..it's not a bad idea to know
the name of the instrument...

89
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,235
..that the captain speaks through.

90
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,996
- I used to know that.
- And your similes... need a little work.

91
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,278
"His guts oozed nice
like a melted malted."

92
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,114
Well, it's, um... a little...

93
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,475
- Too harsh?
- A tad.

94
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,229
Otherwise it was, um...

95
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,311
..very good, it was, uh...

96
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,391
..very real.

97
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,671
Here's another one.
This is a real classic by Mr Pinsky.

98
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,355
It's entitled 100 Girls I'd Like to Pork.

99
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,718
Pork?

100
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,070
It's a coffee-table book.

101
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,559
100 Girls I'd Like to... hm.

102
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,471
"Chapter 1 : Kathleen Turner."

103
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,789
"Chapter 2: Cybill Shepherd.
Chapter 3: Suzanne Pleshette."

104
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,433
"Chapter 4: The Girl
in the Taco Commercial."

105
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,591
"Chapter 5: The Woman in 4B.
Chapter 6: The Oriental Laker Girl."

106
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,671
"Chapter 7: Chris..."

107
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,115
Mr Pinsky, this is not literature.

108
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,749
Well, you know,
I would put in photographs,...

109
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,674
..a brief character sketch,
like a biography,...

110
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,830
..and a nice dust jacket.

111
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,232
- Mr Pinsky, what is this?
- It's... Iiterature. It's a fantasy.

112
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,756
Like Melville. This is
my great white whale.

113
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,276
- It's whacking material.
- lsn't that literature?

114
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,672
How do you associate Moby Dick to a list
of women you'd like to have sex with?

115
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,433
- I think it's brave.
- (Mrs Hazeltine) He's vulgar.

116
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,636
- They said Twain was.
- I'm saying he is.

117
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,234
- I think you're vulgar.
- You're a no-talent shit.

118
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,357
- Maybe I should change the title.
- (man) I like the title.

119
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,954
- (bell)
- OK, I'll see you Wednesday, class.

120
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,476
Good work today. Remember,
a writer writes... always.

121
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,794
Argh! Oh!

122
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,996
- This is your tie.
- Oh, God.

123
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,833
- You dropped it.
- Oh. How'd that get in there?

124
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,717
It got wet. I was afraid it would be ruined.

125
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,674
Thanks.

126
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,751
- Hi. I'm Owen.
- I know.

127
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,149
Why didn't you read my story in class?

128
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,237
- Your story?
- Yeah. Murder at my Friend Harry's.

129
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,550
Why didn't you read it?

130
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,473
- I did.
- You did? What'd you think of it?

131
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,114
It's raining, lrwin.
Can't we discuss it tomorrow?

132
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,919
Owen. Didn't you like it?

133
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,276
- Well... no. No, I didn't.
- Why not?

134
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,716
It was three pages long.
It was a murder mystery...

135
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,031
..that, by the way, was no big trick
in finding the murderer.

136
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,839
- What gave it away?
- You only had two characters,...

137
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,718
..one of which was dead on page two!

138
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,950
Well, one guy killed the other guy.

139
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,792
- It wasn't motivated!
- Sure it was.

140
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,599
A guy in a hat killed
the other guy in a hat.

141
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,511
I have to go now, Owen.

142
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,274
Thanks.

143
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,909
- (bleep)
- Hi, Beth. It's me. It's, uh... 10.30...

144
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,468
..and I did it again. I'm sorry.

145
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,870
It's just that... Margaret was on the...

146
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,474
Oy, there I go again. It's...

147
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,552
I'll... Look, I'm sorry. That's all. Bye.

148
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,759
(tuts)

149
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,233
So Margaret's a big star. That's life.

150
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,073
This is life, too.
That goes on, this goes on.

151
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,789
Hm.

152
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,916
The night was hot.

153
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,912
Wait, no. The night... The night was...

154
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,835
..humid! The night was humid.

155
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,673
No, wait. Hot. Hot! The night was hot.

156
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,069
The night was hot and wet. Wet and hot.

157
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,278
The night was wet and hot... hot and wet...
That's humid. The night was humid.

158
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,148
Maybe the night isn't humid.
Maybe... the night isn't humid.

159
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,870
Maybe it was humid in the morning and
at night it was cold. That gives you fog.

160
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,598
Ha! The night was foggy.

161
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,833
The night... The night was...
The night was...

162
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,310
The night... The night was dry,
yet it was raining.

163
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,951
The... The... The...

164
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,349
The streets were wet,...

165
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,432
..but the night... was as bright...

166
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,351
..as... the...

167
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,558
..earrings in Margaret Donner's ears!
My God! I'm goin' outta my mind!

168
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,993
Fuck it!

169
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,072
The... night... was... humid!

170
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,193
That's it and that's all.

171
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,599
(grunts)

172
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,557
Stop it, dammit!
I got a wax ball in my ear. Get it out.

173
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,951
- Momma!
- You were writing to her, weren't you?

174
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,952
Don't start that again, Momma.
And don't hit me!

175
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,635
- You love her.
- There's no "her", Momma.

176
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,198
- You were writing a letter.
- I'm writin' a story for class, Momma.

177
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,999
- I take a class. I take a nice class.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

178
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,278
- And I'm gonna be a writer some day.
- You know how that typing upsets me.

179
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,828
I'm sorry, Momma. A writer writes.

180
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,832
You're gonna be nothing.
You're gonna be nothing.

181
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,755
You'll never get to first base.
All you do is type, type, type, type, type!

182
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,832
You sit there typing all day
like a fat little pigeon.

183
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,673
You won't ever hear it again, Momma.

184
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,478
I promise.

185
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,799
Aarrghhh!

186
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,713
- Momma...
- I think you got it, sonny.

187
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,997
I don't know what I'd do
without you, Owen baby.

188
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,792
- I know, Momma.
- Owen, my little baby.

189
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,872
- I know.
- Owen, my little baby boy.

190
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,275
(Owen) And even though
he was mortally wounded,...

191
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,193
..the guy in the hat got up...

192
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,875
..and pulled himself up and...

193
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,638
..staggered out into the dark night...

194
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,194
..Iike a milkman...

195
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,317
..going out on his route.

196
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,559
(man) There he is, Owen.

197
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,791
- Professor Donner...
- Not now, Owen. Another time.

198
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,078
- Beth...
- Don't bother.

199
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,993
- I gotta talk to you.
- You're 16 hours late.

200
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,877
And I'm sorry. It's just that...
she was on the television.

201
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,155
Margaret was on TV
and my mind went nuts.

202
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,550
My mind went crazy. I saw
nothing but hate and death.

203
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,996
And I'm sorry, and I did call.
I called you around 10.30.

204
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,913
- Where were you?
- Did you think I'd stay in all night...

205
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,991
..staring at my tandoori chicken?

206
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,756
I know you're angry
and... you have every right to be angry.

207
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,796
It's just that l...

208
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,873
- It's my class.
- Ah. How do you do?

209
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,632
(all) Hi.

210
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,553
- What's your name?
- Beth Ryan.

211
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,596
She teaches anthropology.

212
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,113
Beth... Ryan?

213
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,989
Don't even think about it.

214
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,071
(man) Hang in there, Pinsky.

215
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,197
Come on. I'm sorry. Do you know that
we are this far away from having a date?

216
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,679
We're just this far.

217
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,796
- (as Beth) Hello, you're late.
- I'm sorry.

218
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,192
- You probably made tandoori chicken.
- (as Beth) Come on in, Larry. Oh...

219
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,795
Come on, gimme a second chance.
What do you say? Come on!

220
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,668
- I can't believe I'm saying this. Yes.
- Yeah? Great!

221
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,035
Professor Donner,
I saw your wife on Oprah!

222
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,599
Ex-wife. Ex!

223
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,919
What's with him?

224
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,831
(sighs) I can't get over this.

225
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,309
- Why?
- Why? Why?!

226
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,789
She steals my book! OK?

227
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,158
- She goes on national television...
- I'm not gonna sit here and be barked at.

228
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,478
Wait. Listen to me, Beth. The problem is...

229
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,950
..I can't write. I'm dead inside.
I have no passion.

230
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,238
You have passion. When you talk
about Margaret, you have passion.

231
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,470
Slut!

232
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,911
No, my ex-wife is a major slut.

233
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,195
- But you're not a slut.
- Thank you!

234
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,274
I'm talking about passion!
It's selfless, committed, overflowing!

235
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,351
Not hate and murder!

236
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,477
And slut! I hate her! I wish she was dead!

237
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,275
Chill out.

238
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,918
Thank you.

239
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,797
It's so beautiful!

240
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,108
It's very good, Phil. Very, very good.

241
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,557
Forty yards of Naugahyde, a girl
and a dream. What can I say? It's...

242
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,915
Well, I wrote it just like I lived it.

243
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,515
Which is what you've been
teaching us: to write what we know.

244
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,752
It's very good. It'll blow the lid off
the upholstery business as we know it.

245
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,035
- Thank you.
- OK.

246
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,834
Next is Murder at my Friend Harry's
by Owen... Lift.

247
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,157
"Chapter 1. The night was humid."

248
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,876
Class dismissed.

249
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,758
I have an enormous headache in my eye.

250
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,511
Yuck.

251
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,515
OWEN

252
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,111
(sighs)

253
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,676
(car door closes)

254
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,832
(Larry) I'm so sorry about the cafeteria.
It was Norman Bates in concert.

255
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,469
It's just that I see her and l...

256
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,154
- You wanna kill her.
- Metaphorically, yes.

257
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,629
Specifically, without a doubt.

258
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,916
- I'm glad you called.
- Me, too.

259
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,718
I like trains.

260
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,475
Every great romance or mystery
has a train in it.

261
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,994
- Is this gonna be a great romance?
- Could be.

262
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,039
We have a train, we have the moon,
we have compatible body parts.

263
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,639
- Would you like to kiss me?
- I don't know.

264
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,711
You don't know?

265
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,515
Oh, you're so sweet, Beth.

266
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,955
Oh, Larry, would you like to date me?

267
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,239
- This isn't a date?
- Mmm... I was speaking euphemistically.

268
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,437
- So you're... you're saying...?
- Yeah, yeah.

269
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,717
So you're saying...?
Yeah, you are. I can feel that.

270
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,949
- You're saying no?
- Kids are gonna sit here tomorrow.

271
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,031
Awww...

272
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,068
- I wanna make love to you, Beth.
- Oh, Larry...

273
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,355
Sometime in the very near future.

274
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,874
- Huh?
- I can't.

275
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,030
- What?
- I have writer's block.

276
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,793
- Everywhere?
- Yeah. It's no good. I can't.

277
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,595
- On the train?
- Oh, I wanna ring the bell.

278
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,636
(moans and sighs)

279
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,071
- (Beth) Oh, take me, Casey.
- Who?

280
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,197
- Take me, Casey.
- I'm taking you, I'm taking you.

281
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,151
- Hi.
- Oh, God!

282
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,793
Do you know Owen?
This is Owen. Owen is a dead man.

283
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,316
- Did I come at a bad time?
- Owen... I'm dating.

284
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,515
You read it, right? My story?

285
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,591
- Yes.
- Good.

286
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,797
Owen, you cannot follow me around
asking me questions.

287
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,078
This stuff belongs in the classroom.
Not on my time. Do you understand me?

288
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,791
Oh.

289
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,871
I'm sorry.

290
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,710
Good night, Miss Ryan.

291
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,831
- Did you like it?
- No!

292
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,832
(ringing)

293
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,431
(Owen) Why didn't you like it?

294
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,316
Because in a novel people have to have
more of a reason to commit a murder.

295
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,279
If they just do it because they're crazy,
it's not strong enough for a novel.

296
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,512
You mean, if someone ruined you
permanently, then you could murder 'em?

297
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,912
Yes. Which brings us to the second point.
The motive: you have to eliminate it.

298
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,798
- Eliminate the motive.
- Correct. I'll give you an example.

299
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,519
My ex-wife. I hate her guts, right?

300
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,196
Yeah. I overheard you in the cafeteria.
She really ruined you.

301
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,432
Yes, she did. And I hate her with
a passion. But I would never murder her.

302
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,714
- You'd get caught.
- Absolutely right.

303
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,509
I would get caught because
I have a motive and people know that.

304
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,874
I got a similar problem with my momma.

305
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,714
Well, look at this, Owen. This is amazing.
You and I have something in common.

306
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,477
- We do?
- Absolutely. Think about what I'm saying.

307
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,916
And then you just draw on
your own personal experiences.

308
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,118
You mean... how do you murder
and not get caught?

309
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,589
So how do you not get caught?

310
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,914
Owen? How do you not get caught?

311
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,356
By eliminating the motive
and establishing an alibi.

312
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,436
- How?
- I can't tell you everything. I don't know.

313
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,592
- Go see a Hitchcock film.
- Wanna go to the movies with me?

314
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,195
No, I don't wanna go to the movies.
It's real late and l...

315
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,431
I'm gonna go now.
You're gonna be fine. OK?

316
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,116
- Thank you, Professor Donner.
- Good night, Owen.

317
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,555
Eliminate the motive.

318
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,953
Eliminate...

319
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,031
Elim...

320
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,111
Eliminate the motive.

321
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,431
Motive.

322
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,557
Hitchcock.

323
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,714
Let's say that you'd like
to get rid ofyour wife.

324
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,235
Let's say that you have
a very good reason.

325
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,232
- No, let's not...
- No, no. Let's say.

326
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,869
You'd be afraid to kill her.
You know why? You'd get caught.

327
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,157
And what would trip you up? The motive.

328
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,952
Ah. Now here's my idea.
It's so simple, too.

329
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,956
Two fellows meet accidentally,
like you and me.

330
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,555
Each one has somebody
that he'd like to get rid of.

331
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,798
So... they swap murders.

332
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,994
- Swap murders? (laughs)
- Each fellow does the other's murder.

333
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,993
Then there's nothing to connect them.
Each one has murdered a total stranger.

334
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,352
Like... you do my murder, I do yours.

335
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,073
Your wife, my father. Crisscross.

336
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,630
Some people are better off dead.
Each one has murdered a total stranger.

337
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,951
They swap murders.
You do my murder. Crisscross.

338
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,029
I do yours.

339
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,475
They swap murders. Crisscross.

340
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,950
Crisscross.

341
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,876
(Beth) "Choo-Choo Charlie said
to himself: I think I can. I know I can."

342
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,511
"He opened up his throttle and pushed
and pulled and pushed and pulled...

343
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,151
..and it spluttered some more
and then... and then he... and then..."

344
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,989
- How's that blockage problem?
- All aboard!

345
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,798
- (Beth) Woo-woo!
- (phone rings)

346
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,871
(Beth) No, no. Don't. Don't.

347
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,030
- I'm buying a gun, Owen.
- You must wonder what happened to me.

348
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,271
- Uh... no, not at all.
- I saw that movie.

349
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,634
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

350
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,917
I know now what you tried to tell me,
Professor Donner.

351
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,479
- Oh, good.
- Crisscross.

352
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,039
(Momma) Owen!

353
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,430
- I'll call you in a few days, pal.
- Take your time, Owen. OK?

354
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,750
- Bye.
- Owen!

355
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,994
- Coming, Momma!
- Who were you talking to?

356
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,709
- I just called the weather.
- You were talking to a machine?

357
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,674
Two minutes ago
you were my agent, and now...

358
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,513
Larry, I'm sorry.
That's the way the mop flops.

359
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,512
After seven years I get
"That's the way the mop flops"?

360
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,388
Larry, you must feel like this is
the lowest point of your entire life.

361
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,995
Arnie, what are you doing?
Don't bend the fern. Fluff it!

362
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,993
How, as a human being, can you give up
on somebody after seven years?

363
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,835
Larry, this is a whole other agency.
Besides, you've never written anything.

364
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,911
What about Hot Fire?

365
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,479
This may be a tad bit disturbing, but
we've just signed your wife on as a client.

366
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,996
Get me a doctor, Joel.
I'm having a heart attack.

367
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,355
The book sold two million copies! Arnie...

368
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,273
But I wrote that and you know that!
Arnie knows that!

369
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,193
Margaret couldn't write
her name in the snow!

370
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,432
Larry, for seven years I've given you
assignments. I've made your deals.

371
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,513
And for seven years
you didn't want to "compromise your art"!

372
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,513
Oh, boy. It is just like an agent
to think that a writer can't be an artist.

373
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,831
- Don't change the subject. Where was l?
- You were letting me go.

374
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,955
Thank you.

375
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,555
For four years you've been writing
a novel no one has ever seen.

376
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,758
So you get the shaft from your wife.
It's another excuse for not writing.

377
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,119
Well, go ahead, Larry! Go! Go to Mexico!
Write your heart out! Andele, arriba!

378
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,839
But I handle writers, Larry, not artists.

379
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,832
You go be an artist.
Let the rest of the world make a living.

380
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,117
Here. It's my favourite fuchsia.
Live and be well.

381
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,949
That's the house. This is good here.

382
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,033
- I'll be right back. I'm gonna visit my aunt.
- OK, bro.

383
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,228
- (object drops)
- Oh, shit.

384
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,235
(  Hawaiian music)

385
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,871
Why, Mr Lopez.

386
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,595
Can I borrow that... towel?

387
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,631
My big Chihuahua.

388
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,511
- Oh!
- (Mr Lopez growls)

389
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,591
(Margaret laughs)

390
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,671
Grrr! Ruff, ruff!

391
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,911
Ruff, ruff! Ruff! Grrr!

392
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,711
(phone rings)

393
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,791
Ruff, ruff, ruff!

394
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,071
- Ruff! Ruff!
- (Margaret moans)

395
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,711
(phone still ringing)

396
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,031
- Ruff, ruff!
- Hello?

397
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,029
Oh, hi, Joel. It's my agent.

398
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,111
- Ruff!
- My agente.

399
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,432
How's LA, darling?

400
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,910
Oh, nothing much. I'm having
a little trouble with the... gardener.

401
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,514
- Ruff... ruff...
- What sound, sweetie?

402
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,591
Oh, that's the... the TV.

403
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,240
- Ruff! Ru-ruff!
- Uh... Old Yeller.

404
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,430
Yes, I know they shot him in the end.

405
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,351
Huh? Yes, darling.

406
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,035
I'm aware of the book signing
tonight... in Maui.

407
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,116
I'll be there. Kiss, kiss.

408
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,995
(growling and moans ofpleasure)

409
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,398
(motor starts)

410
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,271
- (toots horn)
- Bye, Mr Lopez.

411
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,231
(  Hawaiian music)

412
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,031
Last boat to Maui!

413
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,990
This is my first trip to the islands.

414
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,278
(sings along with music)

415
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,152
Oh!

416
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,997
Oh, my God!

417
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,949
(scream merging with laughter)

418
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,511
The night...

419
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,114
..was...n't.

420
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,311
Oy.

421
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,832
There's probably halibut right here
who could write better than me.

422
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,994
Boy. The night was...

423
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,354
If you got a line, fish, just yell it out.

424
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,431
I'm up for grabs.

425
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,955
- (engine fails to start)
- Perfect.

426
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,111
(sighs)

427
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,754
(faraway phone ringing)

428
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,711
(phone still ringing)

429
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,634
What about Brenda Lee?
You like Brenda Lee?

430
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,711
- The jockey?
- No.

431
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,871
(ringing)

432
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,149
- Cloudy.
- (Owen) Aloha.

433
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,630
- What?
- I said aloha.

434
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,991
- Hello.
- Professor Donner?

435
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,832
- Hello?
- Hello!

436
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,148
- Hello.
- Professor Donner, stay by the phone.

437
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,549
I don't want 'em
to be able to trace the call.

438
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,868
(dialling tone)

439
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,871
(groans)

440
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,951
(phone rings)

441
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,950
- Who is this?
- Professor Donner?

442
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,708
- Aloha! Hello!
- Who is this?

443
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,791
It's Owen!

444
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,509
- Owen?
- Yeah, from class!

445
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,591
What do you want?

446
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,477
It's done. You want anything from Hawaii?

447
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,029
- Hawaii?
- Wiki-wiki.

448
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,111
Aloha 'oe

449
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,159
- What are you doing in Hawaii?
- Crisscross. You know.

450
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,995
Owen, I'm hanging up on you now.

451
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,033
Oh, yeah, right! I got ya!
Boy, are you smart!

452
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,999
(phone rings)

453
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,514
She didn't feel a thing.
I know how important that is to you.

454
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,831
- Who?
- Your wife.

455
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,435
She had a little trouble walkin',
but that was from the gardener.

456
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,229
- You saw my wife?
- She was kind of a tart, Larry.

457
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,278
But I can see why you married her.
She was very beautiful.

458
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,828
Owen, you stay away from my wife.

459
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,911
(Owen hangs up)

460
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,952
(phone rings)

461
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,635
Did you hear what I said, Owen?
You stay away from my wife.

462
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,759
- I told you, it's done. Nobody saw.
- What the hell are you talking about?

463
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,354
Crisscross, like in the movie. Done!

464
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,116
Owen, what the hell
did you do to my wife?

465
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,430
I... I don't wanna say on the phone.

466
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,512
All I can tell you is
that I killed her last night.

467
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,672
(dialling tone)

468
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,955
My God! Oh, my God.

469
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,511
Oh, my God.

470
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,469
(phone rings)

471
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,518
Owen, what the hell did you do?
Tell me the truth.

472
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,956
Meet me tonight at 7.30 at
Mulholland Drive and Cahuenga Pass.

473
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,555
- We'll discuss your end ofthe bargain.
- What are you talking about?

474
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,200
- You gotta kill my mother.
- Kill your mother?!

475
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,669
7.30, Cahuenga Pass. Crisscross.

476
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,751
- Owen, l...
- (Owen hangs up)

477
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,031
Crisscross... Criss...

478
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,033
Holy shit. He did it.
He did it! The little bastard did it!

479
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,954
He killed my wi... No, he didn't do it.
He couldn't poss... No, he didn't do it.

480
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,554
I'll call her up, call her up on the phone.

481
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,996
She'll answer the phone,
I'll hang up, and she won't be dead.

482
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,071
That's it and that's all.

483
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,031
(phone rings)

484
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,710
Come on, come on, Margaret. Answer
the phone. Answer the phone, Margaret.

485
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,032
Why the hell isn't she
answering the phone?

486
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,999
Because she's dead. That's why
she's not answering the phone.

487
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,833
You don't answer the phone
when you're dead!

488
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,871
They're gonna think I did it.
They're gonna think that I did it!

489
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,077
Why would they think that I did it?
Because I hate her guts!

490
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,913
That's why they'll think
that I did it. My God...

491
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,432
I have no alibi.

492
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,512
Lester! I was with you yesterday! Lester!

493
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,758
- I was with you yesterday, right, Lester?
- Right. And now I'm with Ms Gladstone.

494
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,395
I left the club at one.
I couldn't have done it!

495
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,109
That's right. You couldn't have done it.
Close the door on your way out.

496
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,273
I couldn't have gone to Hawaii and back
in that time. So what am I worried about?

497
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,592
That's what I'd like to know. Hawaii
and back? No way, man. You're cool.

498
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,549
Well... Now, if he left the club at one,
he could catch the three o'clock flight.

499
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,916
You could be in Hawaii by five,
given the three-hour time change.

500
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,798
- She's got a point.
- You could spend four hours there...

501
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,474
..and still catch the last flight out by ten.

502
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,916
- That's true.
- You'd arrive at LAX by 6am.

503
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,039
An hour on the freeway...
You'd be home by seven.

504
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,396
Whatever it is, you're fuckin' guilty, man.

505
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,994
Meet Senior Flight Supervisor Gladstone.

506
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,629
Hi. Pleased to meet you. Listen,
I've got a flight schedule in here.

507
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,188
- I was on a rock!
- A rock?

508
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,750
They're gonna think I did it!
I'm all motive and no alibi!

509
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,910
I have no alibi! Motives are no problem.

510
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,514
I'm up to my ass in motives.
I'm majoring in motives.

511
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,878
Alibi, nowhere near my neighbourhood.
But motives: whooo-ooh!

512
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,953
- I gotta go! Can I borrow your car?
- Sure, man. The keys are on the table...

513
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,679
..next to the door. Goodbye.

514
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,516
I gotta find Beth.

515
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,678
What am I doing?
What the hell am I doing?!

516
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,513
She's not dead.
I'm crazy. I'm a crazy man.

517
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,239
She is not dead. He didn't kill her.

518
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,433
News from Hawaii: Novelist Margaret
Donner is missing and presumed dead.

519
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,193
- According to the police...
- Holy Christ!

520
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,589
I'm not crazy! She's presumed!

521
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,912
She was last seen boarding a boat
to Maui. She disappeared along route.

522
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,436
- A search is on for the body.
- Margaret is dead! Poor Margaret!

523
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,796
She is the renowned author
of the best-selling novel "Hot Fire".

524
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,077
That slut! She is a slut! Slut!

525
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,355
Foul play has not been ruled out.

526
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,474
I'm gonna fry!

527
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,551
(  didgeridoo playing)

528
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,319
(door shuts)

529
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,831
I'm in really deep shit, Beth.

530
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,912
Ah. Look who's decided
to breeze back into my life.

531
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,828
- I gotta talk to you.
- You have to talk to me?

532
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,072
You don't return my calls or get in touch.
But hey, you need something from me?

533
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,551
Make yourself at home. Have a seat.

534
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,949
Can I offer you something? A cool drink?

535
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,554
Would you listen to me?
I'm in a lot of trouble!

536
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,870
- I'm on the edge of my seat.
- It's Margaret.

537
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,871
Don't tell me! She's come back.

538
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,349
- She's...
- Pregnant, put on weight...

539
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,635
She's dead!

540
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,233
Oh, God.

541
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,914
- It's awful.
- Larry, I'm sorry.

542
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,353
- Did she suffer?
- He said she didn't feel a thing.

543
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,873
- Her doctor?
- Her killer.

544
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,430
- She was killed?!
- She's dead. It works that way.

545
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,273
Wait! Did the police find a clue
or have a motive or...

546
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,751
If there was a motive, the fat little bastard
never would've killed her! Don't you see?

547
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,149
Eliminate the motive, establish an alibi.

548
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,876
- Just like I told him!
- Just like you told him?!

549
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,555
- We were speaking hypothetically.
- Larry Donner! Did...

550
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,476
- Did you pay a man to kill your wife?
- No! He just did it.

551
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,996
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, look. I told a guy something...

552
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,991
..and he took it the wrong way.

553
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,469
What, uh... What did you say to him?

554
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,757
- "Don't kill my wife", wink, wink?
- I don't like your tone.

555
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,638
- Oh, God. You better leave.
- I got noplace else to go.

556
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,474
- My head is spinning.
- Oh, and my head isn't creamed corn?

557
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,997
You announced that you may or may not
have inadvertently murdered someone.

558
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,069
Mm-hm.

559
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,199
This puts me in a highly distracted
state of mind. I am nauseous.

560
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,274
Great! Margaret is dead, I have no alibi,
and you're mad that I upset your stomach.

561
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:22,478
Well, excuse me. I'll just go
so the police can start their manhunt!

562
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,154
One little murder and I'm Jack the Ripper!

563
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,718
Jeez, you think you know somebody.

564
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,593
Cahuenga Pass.

565
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,955
(Larry's voice)
Leave a snappy message. Bye.

566
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,235
Larry, it's Beth. Um...

567
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,711
Call me at home right now, OK?
As soon as you get in. I'm very confused.

568
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,590
You... came in with just...
murder and Margaret, and I just...

569
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,153
Call me... now. Thank you.

570
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,635
- Larry!
- Get in the car, Owen.

571
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,359
- This isn't your car.
- I borrowed it. Get in!

572
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,830
I thought you might like to have this.
It belonged to Margaret.

573
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,115
Get in the car. Get in the car!

574
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,949
Look what you did. You killed my wife!

575
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,031
No, I didn't. Yes, I did.

576
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,951
You're sick, Owen. You need care.
I am taking you to the police.

577
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,429
Did you know Hawaii
was a series of islands...

578
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,990
..that was all spit up by the same
volcano? I never knew that.

579
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,595
You killed somebody!
You're a murderer! You took a life!

580
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,878
You're right. I'm no good.
How could I do that? I'm a sick, sick per...

581
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,235
Cows!

582
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,676
- Why did you kill my wife?!
- I thought you wanted me to.

583
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,038
You said you wished she was dead.
I told you I wished my momma was dead.

584
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,680
I kill your wife, you kill my momma.
That's fair.

585
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,955
I am not killing your mother.

586
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,794
- You have to turn yourself in.
- No. It was part of our plan.

587
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,555
What plan?!
There was no plan, you moron!

588
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,998
You killed a person and
I'm takin' you to the police!

589
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:16,073
I'll just tell 'em that you did it.
You got the motive.

590
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,955
- You're gonna tell them the truth.
- Huh?

591
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,919
You're gonna tell the police the truth
or I'll kill us both, I swear!

592
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,353
- I didn't do this only for me.
- Say goodbye, Owen.

593
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,432
Larry... Larry, slow down.
You're goin' a tad fast.

594
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,118
Please slow down, Larry!
I don't like goin' fast!

595
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,078
- Are you gonna tell 'em you did it?
- Please slow down!

596
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,872
Huh?

597
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,869
- Yeah. I'll do it.
- OK.

598
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,597
- Please stop the car!
- I can't!

599
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,750
- Stop the car!
- There's no brakes!

600
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,196
- What?! Watch out for that car!
- (car horn)

601
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,953
- Oh. You're a good driver, Larry.
- Just shut up!

602
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,279
Larry! Larry!

603
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,632
Larry, you're originally
from the East, aren't you?

604
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,237
- Owen!
- A man on our block was from the East.

605
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,550
Mr Brockman.
He was in the button business.

606
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,790
- Is that right?
- Yeah. This is good!

607
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,871
It's like the Flintstones car wash.

608
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,753
Larry! Ooh, I can't look!

609
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,115
(truck horn)

610
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,114
Whoa!

611
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,675
So are you telling me
you weren't driving that car?

612
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,320
Look, man. It's like I told you.

613
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,713
He borrowed the car yesterday morning
and I haven't seen him since.

614
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,997
- Did he say where he was going?
- No. Mumbled about motives and alibis.

615
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,957
Motives and alibis?

616
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,511
He figured that since Margaret ruined his
life, you'd think he killed her or somethin'.

617
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,034
- You don't think he did?
- No, I don't think so.

618
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,669
Personally, if the bitch stole my book,
I'd kill her. But that's me.

619
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,513
Larry? There's no way he coulda done it.

620
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,909
What makes you say that?

621
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,958
Because Larry never did...

622
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,837
..anything.

623
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,875
OK. Here we go. Eggs a la Owen.

624
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,713
(sighs) Owen, get it
through your thick head.

625
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,473
I may be a lot of things,
but I am not a killer.

626
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,469
You don't have to blow her brains out.

627
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,632
Thank you! That takes
the pressure right off(!)

628
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,553
She's old. She's got a bad ticker.

629
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,552
All you gotta do is
jerk around a lot when you talk to her.

630
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,438
- "Nice to meet you, Mrs Lift!"
- Would you stop it?

631
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,279
Well, just meet her. Maybe she'd be
somebody you'd like to kill.

632
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,273
(Momma) Owen! What the hell's
going on out there?!

633
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,793
Nothing, Momma!

634
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,032
- (whispers) We woke her up.
- Who are you talking to? Who's in there?

635
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,712
- Nobody, Momma!
- (door bangs)

636
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,871
Who's this?

637
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,758
This is Cousin Paddy.

638
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,833
He's gonna be stayin' with us for a while.
Isn't that nice?

639
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,671
You don't have a Cousin Paddy!

640
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,991
You lied to me!

641
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,149
(Larry groans)

642
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,798
- That's it. That's all.
- Larry... Larry.

643
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,509
I'm sorry. She makes me so nervous.

644
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,070
Come on. Go in there and sit down.
I'll get you some ice.

645
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,840
So what do you think of her?

646
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,354
I think she could relax a little bit.

647
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,436
- Are you gonna do it?
- Owen...

648
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,637
I'm not gonna kill your mother.
If you wanna do it, you do it.

649
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,269
A guy kills my wife.
He can't even kill his own mother.

650
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,794
- You wanna see my coin collection?
- No!

651
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,511
I collect coins.

652
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,956
- I got a dandy collection.
- I don't wanna see it, Owen.

653
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,919
- But it's my collection.
- I don't care.

654
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,639
Look, Owen. I'm just not in the mood. OK?

655
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,550
Never showed it to anyone before.

656
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,669
- All right, I'll look at it.
- No, it's OK.

657
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,751
- Show it to me.
- No, you don't mean it.

658
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,070
- Show me the damn coins!
- All right.

659
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,351
This one is a nickel.

660
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,235
This one also is a nickel.

661
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,471
And here's a quarter.

662
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,431
And another quarter.

663
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,471
And a penny.

664
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,438
See? Nickel, nickel,
quarter, quarter, penny.

665
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,318
Are any of these coins worth anything?

666
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,393
No.

667
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,109
And here... is another nickel.

668
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,277
- Why do you have them?
- What do you mean?

669
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:40,031
The purpose of a coin collection is that
the coins are worth something, Owen.

670
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,031
Oh, but they are.

671
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,873
This one here I got in change...

672
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,952
..when my dad took me
to see Peter, Paul and Mary.

673
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,197
And this one I got in change
when I bought a hot dog at the circus.

674
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,068
My daddy let me keep the change.
He always let me keep the change.

675
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,912
This one...

676
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,752
..is my favourite.

677
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,958
This is Martin and Lewis
at the Hollywood Palladium.

678
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,032
Look at that.

679
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,396
See the way it shines on the little eagle?

680
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,631
I loved my dad a lot.

681
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:21,113
- So this whole collection is...
- Change my daddy let me keep.

682
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,911
- What was his name?
- Ned.

683
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,991
He used to call me his little Ned.

684
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,194
That's why Momma named me Owen.

685
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,271
I really miss him.

686
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,557
- It's a real nice collection, Owen.
- Thank you, Larry.

687
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,916
- Owen! Food!
- In a minute, Momma!

688
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,198
Don't you "in a minute" me! Get off
your fat little ass or I'll break it for you!

689
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,229
I want two soft-boiled eggs, white toast
and some of that grape jelly, goddammit!

690
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,231
And don't burn the toast!

691
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,799
- Kill her, Larry.
- I can't.

692
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,192
You gotta kill her for me, Larry.
Don't you understand? Crisscross.

693
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,592
Crisscross! You gotta do it, Larry!
If you don't, I will. I swear I will.

694
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,989
Move it, fat boy!

695
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,072
- That's it! I'm gonna choke her to death!
- No, Owen!

696
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,230
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill her!

697
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,591
- Calm down, Owen.
- Larry...

698
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,831
It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK, Owen.

699
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,911
I promise.

700
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,117
Will you do it?

701
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,077
Yeah. I'll do it.

702
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,589
Larry, you're the best pal a guy ever had.

703
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,910
Here. Look. I want you to have this.

704
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,879
Look. Here. It's a souvenir from
the London Bridge gift shop in Arizona.

705
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:38,193
Look. See? They brought this bridge over
from London, England, stone by stone.

706
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,874
See the little bridge?
See the stones there?

707
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,758
- Yeah, I see 'em.
- Here. You can have that.

708
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,355
Crisscross.

709
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,077
- When did you last see him?
- I can't remember. I told you.

710
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,078
- The day after his wife disappeared?
- I didn't say that.

711
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,631
- Miss Ryan, why are you protecting him?
- I'm not. I just don't think he killed her.

712
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,188
Where do you think he is, Miss Ryan?

713
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,111
I don't know!

714
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,674
- He's in a lot of trouble.
- He didn't do it.

715
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,479
Then who do you suppose did?

716
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,558
- Somebody else.
- So you do think it was murder.

717
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,912
- You know who killed her, don't you?
- No.

718
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,992
- Yes, you do.
- I do not! He wouldn't tell me!

719
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,469
Did Professor Donner
hire a man to kill his wife?

720
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,552
No! He said... not really.

721
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,956
And I heard him scream out
"l hate her! I wish she were dead!"

722
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,716
Yeah, I heard him. He said
"l hate her. I wish she was dead."

723
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,597
That's what he said.

724
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,872
"l hate her. I wish she was dead."

725
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,791
He called her a very bad name...

726
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,997
..and screamed "l hate her.
I wish she were dead."

727
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,351
It's a coffee-table book.

728
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,231
(TV on)

729
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,311
All right, Momma.

730
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,709
Turn off the TV.

731
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,472
OK.

732
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:20,271
Goodbye, Momma.

733
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,711
- She'll be sleepin' in a couple of minutes.
- I graduated from Yale.

734
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,712
All right. Out you go.

735
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,998
- Out? Out where?
- Out on the ledge. Go out on the roof...

736
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,517
- No, no. I'm not going out on any ledge.
- You gotta make it look like a burglar.

737
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,149
- You go in, you mess up things...
- No, Owen. This is going too far.

738
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,719
- You want outta this?
- Yes.

739
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,271
Then fulfil your end of the bargain. You go
in, stuff a pillow over her face and leave.

740
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,716
You walk out that door.
You never have to see me again, OK?

741
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,631
Oh, God!

742
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,391
- OK. Out you go.
- Shit. I hate heights.

743
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,635
Larry!

744
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,151
- You all right? Move your hand.
- Why?

745
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,878
Gotta close the window.

746
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,828
And like this you kill an evening.

747
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,909
Rats! Now I got Willard here.

748
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:33,993
I'm bein' held captive by a little troll who
should be hanging off a rear-view mirror.

749
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,071
I'm not doin' this.

750
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,432
- Aargh!
- What are you doin'?

751
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,432
I'm selling The Watchtower!
What do you think?!

752
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,478
You got rats the size of Oldsmobiles here!

753
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,830
Rats.

754
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,435
OK, forget about the burglar stuff.
Just go through her door.

755
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:59,275
It's less dramatic but I don't wanna
make you uncomfortable. Here, use this.

756
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,272
- I really don't like you, Owen.
- OK, I gotta go.

757
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,591
If I'm late for my lane,
they tack on an extra buck.

758
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,591
Ugh. What a week.

759
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,154
Mrs Lift, I know you don't want to hear
anything derogatory about your son.

760
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:53,712
I understand that. Because he's not a bad
man, Mrs Lift. He's a nice man, actually.

761
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,678
He is a lunatic. No, Mrs Lift, he is.

762
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,955
He's a lunatic. And, um...

763
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,273
I don't have to be here now, Mrs Lift.
I could be in Mexico, out of all of this.

764
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,749
I'm only here to stop him fr...

765
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,029
How do you say this, Mrs Lift?

766
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,756
Listen to me, Mrs Lift.

767
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,317
Your son... killed my wife.

768
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,635
And now he wants me to kill you.

769
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,995
(snores)

770
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,789
- Mrs Lift?
- (snores)

771
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,355
- I'm gonna go read the paper now and...
- (snoring continues)

772
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,874
I'm just glad we had this chance to talk.

773
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,111
(snores)

774
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:44,959
I'm a fugitive. The little bastard
turned me into Richard Kimble.

775
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,350
He shit and shoved me in it.
I gotta get outta here! I gotta go!

776
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,195
Where am I running? Evidence.
Incriminating evidence!

777
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,477
Nothing.

778
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,391
Ha! A lei.

779
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,911
Poha jelly.

780
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,631
Not enough!

781
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,317
Poha jelly, a lei and a doll.
I need some evidence.

782
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,391
Aha! Bingo. The mother lode.

783
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,199
A plane ticket!
A little careless, Owen, aren't we?

784
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,475
Los Angeles, Hawaii, 10am!

785
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,518
(cackles) I got you! A plane ticket!

786
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,591
With my name on it.

787
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,477
Oh, God!

788
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,551
(knock at door)

789
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,637
Cops!

790
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,551
(knocking continues)

791
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,631
Mr Lift?

792
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,791
(heart thumping)

793
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,750
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

794
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,831
I hope there's no trouble.

795
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,799
I was at the bowlin' alley all night.
I hope there's nothin' wrong.

796
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,838
No, we'd like to ask you
about Professor Donner.

797
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,117
- Professor Donner?
- Yes. Would you mind if we came in?

798
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,948
- In the house?
- Just a few questions.

799
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,994
I... I'm sorry. You can't.

800
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,397
My momma's real sick.
I don't think it's a good idea.

801
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,995
- lt'll only take a minute.
- No, l...

802
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,475
OK! All right. Come on up.

803
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,552
If it'll only take a minute,
that won't be so bad.

804
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,071
Would you like to meet my momma?

805
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,592
We understand you take Professor
Donner's course at Valley College.

806
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,910
Yeah. Creative writing.

807
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,594
I'm gonna put my bowlin' ball away.

808
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,673
- I'm his star pupil.
- Do you have any idea where he is?

809
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:11,038
Did you try his apartment? He goes there
a lot. He keeps his stuff there.

810
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,951
You guys wanna have some tea?

811
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,031
We've got orange pekoe,...

812
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,475
..we've got lrish breakfast,...

813
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,471
..we've got Darjeeling...

814
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:25,030
Mr Lift, have you ever heard
Professor Donner talk about his wife?

815
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:29,671
Professor Donner? Oh, he... he always
talked about her like she was an angel.

816
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,991
He loved his wife.
He worshipped the ground she... Hi.

817
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,673
Hi, tea! Hi, tea. Hi.

818
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,070
You never heard him say
anything bad about her?

819
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:46,073
Oh. This is lrish breakfast.
I'll get Darjeeling.

820
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,391
Whatever you want, Mr Lift.
We won't be havin' any.

821
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,393
- What was that question again?
- (Momma) Owen!

822
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,435
Momma! You're alive!

823
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,835
Old people - you have to reassure them.

824
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,513
Mr Lift, can we get back
to Professor Donner?

825
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,913
Yes. By all means, let's get back to him.

826
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:16,152
- Mr Lift...
- Oh! You know what?

827
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,595
This... This box is empty.

828
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,717
Could you get me some tea in the pantry?

829
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,954
Sure. No problem.

830
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:30,792
(detective) You said that he loved his wife.
What gave you that idea?

831
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,751
Oh! I'm sorry, officer.

832
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:37,594
I have some tea right here on the stove.
It won't be necessary.

833
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,990
- Oh. No problem.
- What was that question again?

834
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,719
What makes you think
that he loved his wife?

835
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,398
But you know what you could get me
is some sugar.

836
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,119
Is it in the pantry?

837
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,715
- Yeah.
- No problem.

838
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:58,555
I shouldn't use sugar in my tea because
I'm carryin' around this spare tyre.

839
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,269
I'd like to get rid of it
but it's so hard to cut back.

840
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,868
- Owen! You did it, didn't you, Owen?
- No, Momma, I didn't.

841
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,270
- Yes, you did!
- No! Honest to God, I didn't do it!

842
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,193
You told them to take me away!

843
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,158
Oh. No, Momma. No.

844
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:21,314
- You came to take me away!
- I'm sorry. My momma's not feelin' well.

845
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,630
Not feeling well, my foot!

846
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,551
- I'm sorry.
- You little bastard!

847
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,200
I said you'd desert me, and you did!

848
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,431
The only way they'll get me
outta here is to drag me out!

849
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,512
You're gonna have to
take me out in a pine box!

850
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,752
Get out! Get outta my house!

851
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,077
Owen!

852
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,831
You're grounded!

853
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,074
I can't believe that you brought them here!

854
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,879
- Why didn't you kill Momma?
- Because I'm not a killer!

855
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,748
I can't put a pillow over her face
and squeeze the life out of her!

856
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,353
- You see that door with the hook on it?
- Yeah.

857
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:07,878
Every night around nine o'clock, she yells
"Bath" and hangs her shawl on that hook.

858
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,315
- I'll bet that's where I come in.
- Yeah.

859
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,550
- Now, how did I know that?
- Come on, come on.

860
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,312
- Watch out for my skates.
- Ow!

861
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,151
(hinge falls down stairs)

862
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,552
She'll get out of her chair,
she'll go to the door,...

863
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,155
..you go behind her and pow!
Down the stairs she goes.

864
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,870
- And where are you gonna be?
- Howie's Lanes. Come on.

865
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,593
To hell with this guy! What am l? Crazy?

866
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,635
I'm outta here. I can't stay here.

867
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,874
- I can't stay in this house!
- (siren)

868
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,151
Stand back, please.

869
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,429
Milk and Mallomars...

870
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,991
Bath!!

871
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,913
- Who the hell are you?!
- I'm Owen's friend.

872
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,073
- Owen doesn't have a friend!
- That's because he's shy.

873
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,196
No, he's not. He's fat and he's stupid.

874
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,669
Get outta my house! Where is Owen?

875
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,990
- Owen went bowling.
- I want Owen!

876
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,753
- He'll be back soon.
- I want my bath and my medicine!

877
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,229
- I can get it for you.
- Who the hell are you?

878
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,356
- Let me hang that up.
- I can do it myself!

879
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:12,752
- I know, but I'd like to hang it up for you.
- Get out of my way, you black bastard!

880
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,478
What?!

881
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,358
Mrs Lift!

882
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,795
- He tried to kill me.
- What?

883
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,235
I said, he's tryin' to kill me!

884
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,833
Mrs Lift! Don't...

885
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,629
I can hang up my own goddamn shawl.

886
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,917
He's trying to kill me!

887
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,118
I asked for the salted nuts!
He brought me the unsalted nuts!

888
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,714
The unsalted nuts make me choke!

889
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,557
Aargh!

890
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,271
Pain in the ass!

891
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,877
Oh, no!

892
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,629
Your friend had an accident. He's dead!

893
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,712
You go bowling and leave
a corpse to take care of me!

894
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,394
- He's dead?
- See for yourself!

895
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,151
Larry! My friend!

896
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,835
- My friend! Larry!
- (mimics) "My friend! My friend!"

897
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,911
You little crybaby!

898
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,390
Go bury him in the yard
before he stinks up the place!

899
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,677
Larry, you're alive!

900
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,517
You killed her.

901
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:07,235
Holy shit! What a dream I was having!

902
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,550
Louis Armstrong was trying to kill me!

903
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,190
- Mrs Lift?
- Get away from me, you horse's ass!

904
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,951
(groans)

905
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:27,070
She's not a woman. She's the Terminator.

906
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,071
(dinging)

907
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:58,197
The ex-husband of missing novelist
Margaret Donner...

908
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:01,352
..is wanted for questioning
but has now himself disappeared.

909
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:06,116
If you have any information regarding his
whereabouts, contact your local police.

910
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,476
Owen! There's a murderer in the house!

911
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,274
Hello, police? I found him!
The wife murderer!

912
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,555
- He's here!
- Gimme the phone!

913
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,951
I'm on the next train to Mexico.

914
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,635
- No! This is no time to panic.
- This is the perfect time to panic!

915
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,838
She turned me in! Do what you want
with her. I gotta think about myself.

916
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,911
Larry, don't leave me!

917
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,598
Larry!

918
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,157
(cracking)

919
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,515
I'm sorry, Larry.

920
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,837
It's OK, Owen.

921
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,908
- I messed everything up.
- Owen, it's gonna be OK.

922
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,997
I ruined your life.

923
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:00,675
Come on, Owen. Sometimes
things happen in life for a reason.

924
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:06,153
No, really. Maybe I was meant to go to
Mexico to be a writer. You never know.

925
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,636
This is a great ending.

926
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:12,235
I don't have the beginning,
but this is a great ending.

927
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,915
Story of my life. I always have
great endings and no beginnings.

928
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,514
That's not good for a writer, is it?

929
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,591
No, it's not.

930
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,878
How about "The night was humid"?

931
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,633
- It's hot in here.
- Yeah, hot and close.

932
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:35,311
- Moist.
- Right. "The night was moist."

933
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:39,029
This is what I'm talking about.
It's writing. Finding the perfect word.

934
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,795
The perfect start. "lt was the best
of times, it was the worst of times".

935
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,871
"Now is the winter of our discontent".

936
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,430
See what I'm saying?
Perfect beginnings. Perfect words.

937
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,796
It's like us. We're on a train
to Mexico. We're on the lam.

938
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,269
It's exciting, it's kinda mysterious.

939
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:58,478
Do you say "The night was humid"
or "The night was moist"? That's writing!

940
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,630
The night was sultry.

941
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,269
I'm getting the hell outta here!

942
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,479
Too goddamn sultry in here!

943
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,831
Where you goin'?

944
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,309
I'm gonna kill the bitch.

945
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,440
- You want anything?
- You can get me a Chunky.

946
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:36,473
- Come here, Mrs Lift.
- You stay away from me, you murderer!

947
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,513
Momma...

948
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,159
Mrs Lift!

949
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,596
- (Owen) Momma!
- Murderer! Murderer!

950
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,029
Momma... Momma...

951
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,598
Sultry? I'll show you
something sultry, Mrs Lift!

952
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,238
G, 54.

953
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:02,111
Stupid bingo! Don't you idiots know
there's a murderer loose on this train?!

954
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,354
- Mrs Lift, come back here.
- Bingo bastards.

955
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,351
My mother's a little overmedicated.

956
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:11,353
Murderer! Murderer!
There's a murderer on the train.

957
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,792
Wake up, you nutheads! Murderer!

958
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,633
Excuse me. Excuse me.

959
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,234
Wake up! There's a murderer on the train!

960
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,479
Mrs Lift?

961
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,631
Aarrghhh!

962
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,750
- Mrs Lift, be careful!
- Get away from me, you murderer!

963
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,511
- No!
- (Momma yells)

964
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:39,198
- Mrs Lift...
- Let me go, you murderer!

965
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,919
Owen!

966
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,230
- Larry, you'll kill her!
- Save me!

967
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:46,949
I'm not tryin' to kill her!
I'm tryin' to save her, you toad!

968
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,478
Come on, Mrs Lift!

969
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,993
Owen! Save me!

970
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,238
Aarrghhh!

971
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,957
Owen! Save me!

972
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,996
Owen!

973
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:23,278
- What are you doin' to my momma?!
- Making a wish! What do you think?!

974
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,676
Help!

975
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,432
Oh, no! Larry!

976
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,671
Oh, you saved me, my Owen!

977
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,514
- Mrs Lift, are you OK?
- Beat it, chump!

978
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,718
- Larry!
- Aarghhh!

979
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,351
Bye, Larry!

980
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,071
To tell you the truth,
it was all a little bit embarrassing.

981
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:11,789
My earring fell over the rail.
I bent over to retrieve it.

982
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,155
The last thing I remember,
I was in the water.

983
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,949
She fell off the boat. She fell off the boat.

984
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,474
The little bastard never laid a hand on her.

985
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,630
This wonderful Adonis of the deep...

986
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:24,314
Oh, I love that. "Adonis of the deep".

987
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,312
She's rescued by a fishing boat!
The woman is priceless.

988
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,517
- You gotta love this woman.
- Do you love this woman?

989
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:36,551
Shikamoto nursed me back to health,
and we're going to be married.

990
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,279
Who asked this guy
to pull her outta the water?

991
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,476
(chuckles)

992
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,313
Margaret Donner, author
of the best seller "Hot Fire",...

993
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,279
..has sold the movie rights
of her ordeal at sea for $1.5 million.

994
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:51,352
Will wonders never cease!
Back to you, Stan.

995
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:57,318
She's a genius. She's getting $1.5 million
and I'm getting glucose four times a day.

996
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,994
I'm getting something down the hall.

997
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,629
- What?
- Anything. I can't take this any more.

998
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:07,395
Every ten minutes,
it's "Margaret this" and "Margaret that".

999
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,477
I'm sorry. I just can't help it.

1000
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:12,836
Hate's no good. I'm not
living here with you in hate.

1001
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:17,593
Get rid of it altogether, Larry,
or I'm leaving you.

1002
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,197
Oh!

1003
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,396
Oh, Larry!

1004
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,797
Argh!

1005
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,871
(static on TV)

1006
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,229
(gentle snoring)

1007
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,031
His name was Owen...

1008
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,112
..and he wanted me to kill his mother.

1009
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,875
When I asked him why,...

1010
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,952
..he said because he didn't like her.

1011
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,035
When I asked him why me,...

1012
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,672
..he said it was my idea.

1013
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,553
I was teaching college...

1014
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,151
(continues typing)

1015
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,231
(rings)

1016
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,994
- Hello.
- Aloha.

1017
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,469
- Owen! How are ya!
- I'm fine.

1018
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,916
- Where are you?
- In Topanga Canyon. I just killed Beth.

1019
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,992
- What?
- Nah, I'm kiddin'. Look out your window.

1020
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,594
You little couch potato!

1021
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,513
- Hi, Owen!
- Hi, Larry.

1022
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,395
- Owen, come on up.
- OK.

1023
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:07,676
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too. It's been a year.

1024
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,558
- Wow. You look terrific.
- Thank you. So do you.

1025
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,029
- Well, thanks. How's Momma?
- Dead.

1026
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,953
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Mm, well...

1027
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,678
Did you, um...

1028
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,352
No!

1029
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,908
No. Natural causes.

1030
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,919
- That's good.
- Yeah, well.

1031
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,549
- I see you're writing.
- I started the day I got outta the hospital.

1032
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,792
And I haven't stopped, Owen. I'm half a
paragraph away from finishing my book!

1033
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,269
- That's great!
- Yeah, it's really somethin'.

1034
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,874
Well, you know what they say.

1035
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:41,077
(both) A writer writes... always.

1036
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,551
Well, look. I won't keep you from it.

1037
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,871
- I just came by to say hello and...
- You just got here!

1038
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:51,272
Actually, I gotta catch a plane. I'm goin'
to New York because... I wrote a book.

1039
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,397
- What?
- It's gonna be on the stands in two days.

1040
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,593
You wrote a book?
And it's gonna be published?

1041
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,194
- Yeah.
- Owen, that's unbelievable!

1042
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:03,238
It's called Momma and Owen
and Owen's Friend Larry...

1043
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:07,711
..and it's all about you and me and
Momma and our experiences together.

1044
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,911
What's your book about?

1045
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,876
You wrote a book called Momma
and Owen and Owen's Friend Larry?

1046
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,951
Yeah.

1047
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,549
- It's all about our...
- (both)..experiences together.

1048
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:28,114
- Slut! You slut!
- Are you angry with me?

1049
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,668
- I don't like you, Owen!
- You want me to leave?

1050
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:33,149
No, I want you dead and in hell!

1051
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,598
(Owen gags)

1052
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,911
- I can't breathe!
- Because I'm choking you, you moron!

1053
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,558
Here!

1054
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,551
Here. I want you to have this.

1055
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,437
- What is this?
- That's my book.

1056
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:52,676
- What is this? You wrote a pop-up book?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1057
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:55,718
See? Here's where we meet
in class. Pull that tab.

1058
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:00,469
See? And... And this is you and me
and Beth on the choo-choo.

1059
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,039
Toot, toot!

1060
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:06,593
And here's where you meet Momma.
See her cane?

1061
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,112
(mimics Momma) "Bath!"

1062
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:13,753
- And these are my coins. See my coins?
- It's your coin collection!

1063
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:18,152
And here's... See, instead of you chuckin'
her off a train, we go on a picnic together.

1064
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:21,949
- What do we do? Devil-egg her to death?
- Oh, no. There's no death.

1065
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,713
- There's no death?
- No, this is a kids' book.

1066
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,711
- You wrote a pop-up book!
- Yeah.

1067
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:31,191
- This is the cutest thing I've ever seen!
- Yeah, and here's the best part.

1068
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:35,717
We all go on vacation in Hawaii.
You... and me... and Beth.

1069
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,798
(Beth) "Hate makes you impotent,
love makes you crazy."

1070
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,394
"Somewhere in between
you can survive."

1071
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,429
- Gets better every time I read it.
- Thank you.

1072
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,990
- Except for the last line.
- I beg your goddamn pardon?

1073
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:53,392
Hate makes you impotent, love makes
you crazy. In the middle you can survive?

1074
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,869
- Yeah!
- It's cryptic!

1075
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,315
- Cryptic, he says.
- That's right. Cryptic.

1076
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,276
Cryptic.

1077
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,399
Watch this, Beth. Have you ever seen
a weeble snorkel? Look at him.

1078
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:06,472
You know, actually,
I find it a little confusing.

1079
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,393
- Are you kidding me?!
- Just that last line.

1080
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,357
- Just the last line!
- Yeah.

1081
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,352
This is great. So you
and Sancho Panza agree on this?

1082
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:18,672
You're taking criticism from somebody
who had his book signing at Toys 'R' Us!

1083
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,069
I don't believe this.

1084
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,592
- You're really agreeing with him?
- He's got a point.

1085
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,796
- He's got a point?!
- Yeah!

1086
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,589
I'm a Book-of-the-Month Club alternate,
on the best-seller list.

1087
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:34,195
With his book, you get a free balloon!
I don't understand it.

1088
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:38,432
- (Beth) He's entitled to his opinion.
- I know he's entitled to his opinion.

1089
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,829
But look at him. He's a buoy with hair.

1090
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:46,958
Keep going a little further, Owen.
Maybe somebody'll harpoon you.

1091
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,431
("Shikisha" by Sipho Mabuse)

1092
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,431
People, get ready

1093
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,111
Wherever you are

1094
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,432
People, get ready

1095
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,754
No matter how far

1096
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,955
Everywhere in the village

1097
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,478
People are dancing in the streets

1098
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,959
It's the beginning of the new life

1099
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:38,232
You can turn it up on your radio

1100
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,556

Shikisha, wah, Shikisha

1108
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,753
People are dancing in the streets

1109
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,111
Right across the Limpopo

1110
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:06,552
It's the beginning of the new age

1111
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,639
So turn it up on your radio

1112
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,997
Stomp your feet to the beat

1113
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,071
Feel the heat

1114
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,997
Stomp your feet to the beat

1115
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,071
Feel the heat

1116

Stomp your feet to the beat

1117

Stomp your feet to the beat

01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,036
Wah, Shikisha

1121
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,759
Shikisha!

1122
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,591
Stomp your feet

1123
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,471
Stomp your feet

1124
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,591
Stomp your feet

1125
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,711
Stomp your feet
