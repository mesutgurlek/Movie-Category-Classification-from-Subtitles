I'll break it down for you,
all you really need to know is...

6
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,859
On this whole, sear brown skin..

7
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,960
A Mexican man hates a Honduran,

8
00:01:46,745 --> 00:01:50,258
Just like a Guatemalan hates a Salvadoran.
They're really not all the same.

9
00:01:50,293 --> 00:01:51,246
No matter what you think.

10
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:52,247
Everybody's dealing dope.

11
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:54,245
Twenty-four Seven.

12
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:56,644
Like opening a supermarket.

13
00:01:56,645 --> 00:01:59,607
Everybody got a wood-stick for LAPD.

14
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:02,058
Typical onion head banger.

15
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:03,059
Maybe a mexican, you know?

16
00:02:04,615 --> 00:02:07,155
Tucson or Fuego..
and all the shit that eldoras..

17
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:11,905
something important, what little barn
or cooler can Uncle Juanito comes from.

18
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,652
How many fucking cayotes,

20
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:19,710
What about the scandal?

21
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:24,165
Scandal is bullshit.

22
00:02:25,735 --> 00:02:29,085
Two dickhead cops got involved
in some fuck off..

23
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:34,523
ratted out the entire sweet division,
to save their wretched own asses.

24
00:02:35,474 --> 00:02:37,312
D.A's office is running scared;

25
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:42,215
Afraid to file..
afraid not to exonerate en fucking mass...

26
00:02:42,457 --> 00:02:44,610
Now you got a lot of hopped up

with their own 'get out of jail' free card,
and pile of county cash.

29
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:52,705
This used to be a glorious soldier's department.

30
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:54,925
Now, it's...

31
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:58,480

32
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:01,610
What's funny?

33
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,022
Private Hatcher here's enquiring
about the scandal of the century.

34
00:03:07,657 --> 00:03:08,921
You didn't touch your fries?
- What?

35
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:11,069
No, I had a couple of them,

36
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,911
but i got a cholesterol thing,
What.. you want 'em?

37
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:16,187
No, you want them.

38
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:17,188
Finish it.

39
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:21,524

40
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:23,480

Dave hates wasting food.

43
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:31,296
You never see him eating nothing but...

44
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,390
he hates wasting food.

45
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:34,391
Hey, if you keep going
the way you're going..

46
00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:37,198
you're gonna start looking like
one of 'em crackheads.

47
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:41,330
Munch, munch! Cowgirl..c'mon.

48
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:43,554
Very attractive crackhead, mind you.

49
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:46,201
You want one?

50
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:47,202
- No, no..no. You're doing good.

51
00:03:47,203 --> 00:03:48,203
I'd stay healthy.

52
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,027
Finish those fucking fries,

53
00:03:52,742 --> 00:03:53,380

Huh?

57
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,762
No, sir.

58
00:04:02,797 --> 00:04:04,662
I never met my father.

59
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:08,736
Never met him...Why?

60
00:04:08,745 --> 00:04:11,244
- He wasn't around.

61
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,560
General!

62
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:31,164
Eat up.

63
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,163
You aim for the shortest wet-back..

64
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:39,355
You watch him skedaddle,
Pull out the dice in shit small liquor cans.

65
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:42,637
And hit your siren in farewell.

66
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:43,638
Let's see what we've got.

67
00:04:58,854 --> 00:04:59,679
You'll get the hang of it.

68
00:04:59,714 --> 00:05:00,985
Aren't you worried?

69
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:01,986

Illegal is just a shit bird.

75
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:18,412
Just some military occupation kit.

No Hello, Helen?

00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:52,314
Don't call me that.

120
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:23,962
What's up, monkey?

121
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:26,860
- Helen has a question.

122
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,049
Maybe, You have a question.

123
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:35,155
- Uhm, We both have a question.

124
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,070
Helen's studying genetics in school;

125
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:43,029
and since our moms are sisters
and you're our dad...

126
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,208
We were just wondering,
If we're inbred.

127
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:49,660
It's not funny!

128
00:09:49,661 --> 00:09:50,661
No, sorry...

129
00:09:50,662 --> 00:09:51,662
Sorry.

130
00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:55,397
No. I married your moms consecutively,

131
00:09:55,398 --> 00:09:57,897
Not, concurrently.

132
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:01,889
Which makes you and Helen,
first cousins and sisters..Half.

133
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,320
...It's all..

134
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:08,465
perfectly legal and genetically
upto insurance's

135
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:10,965
industries standards.

136
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:13,465
You're not gonna turn into Mongoloids,

137
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:15,965
anytime soon.
If that's what you're asking.

138
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:18,495
You're not inbred.
You know what you are?

139
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:20,551
You are Native.

140
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:44,656
Marla, where's the olives?

141
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,234
There's no olives.

142
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:50,343
I'm sorry, I don't know.
I think we're out.

143
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:52,190
I'll look, but i think
we are out.

144
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:59,154
Why do you let her put that
thing on the wall?

145
00:10:59,155 --> 00:11:00,155
Helen's poster?

146
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:02,738
- Yeah, that little cloth.

147
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:03,739
It's amazing!
She's been working really hard on it.

148
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:05,275
She's been working on that thing
for three weeks.

149
00:11:07,722 --> 00:11:08,368
It's amazing, is it?

150
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:10,868
- It's..it's quite something.
- It is amazing.

151
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:13,827
I think it should be at the museum.

152
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:15,869
That's what I think.

153
00:11:19,715 --> 00:11:21,806
Don't you tell your mother,
you learned that from me.

154
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:31,935
May I sleep with you, tonight?

155
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:35,596
I have sketching to do.

156
00:11:36,247 --> 00:11:37,417
Please.

157
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,067
No? So, that's not a 'no'..Is it?

158
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:47,471
- That would be a nice way to say, NO.

159
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:50,977
What about after, your sketching?

160
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:51,978
- No.

161
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,639
Helen?

162
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,039
I'm curious about that artwork,
you have on the wall there.

163
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,056
What it mean?

164
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:15,057
What's it mean?

165
00:12:14,746 --> 00:12:17,245
- What's it mean?
- Yeah, what is that?

166
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:19,745
What does that mean, that collage?

167
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:22,610
It's like, little bits of paper.
You cut them out and you like..

168
00:12:23,005 --> 00:12:25,886
glue 'em together...
and like, make another picture -

169
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:30,897
Okay, so you have..like a man's head..
and a woman's heel..

170
00:12:31,469 --> 00:12:33,286
digging into his head and..

171
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,029
stepping on his mouth and..

172
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,529
- It's art. Dave..it's art.

173
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,844
Naked woman and blood flowing
from her vagina. You have...

174
00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:46,403
You have the C word prominently displayed.

175
00:12:46,404 --> 00:12:48,830
- You have eyes. That's great!

176
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,533
What's the problem?

177
00:12:51,534 --> 00:12:54,033
What is the problem?

178
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:58,093
Margereth, do you like..
Do you like her collage?

179
00:12:58,094 --> 00:12:59,094
What is it?

180
00:12:59,095 --> 00:13:00,684
Yeah, I agree.
It just need more color.

181
00:13:00,685 --> 00:13:01,685
More color.

182
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,957
Honey?
- Mmmhmm.

183
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:06,889
How's your spagetti?

184
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,890
- It's good.

185
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:08,891
Yeah?

186
00:13:08,892 --> 00:13:09,892
That's good.

187
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:12,806
How is yours?

188
00:13:13,713 --> 00:13:15,675
- It's very good. Thank you.
You should try some.

189
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:19,890
Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.

190
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:21,717
Do your wanna cover later?

191
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:25,295
- I have a boyfriend.

192
00:13:25,768 --> 00:13:26,773
Cheat on him.

193
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,094
- Like you cheat on your taxes?

194
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:33,651
I don't cheat on my taxes.

195
00:13:34,668 --> 00:13:35,943
You can't...

196
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:38,279
cheat on something, you never commited to.

197
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Alright.

198
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,300
I'm gonna go take a walk,
look for smilers.

199
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:51,099
Come on, we're just setting out something to eat.

200
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:54,598
He wouldn't be like this,
if you guys weren't so hard on him.

201
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:55,599
If only we have that option.

202
00:13:57,323 --> 00:13:58,580
Well, it's the truth.

203
00:13:58,581 --> 00:13:59,581
It's always something.

204
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:00,582
It's not the truth..
- okay.

205
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,833
But he's too hard on him,
but still..

206
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:34,726
Yeah, Dave Brown. Just..
It's too plain a name for somebody like me.

207
00:14:34,727 --> 00:14:35,727
- What? You don't have a moniker?

208
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:38,392
You don't have a moniker,
like something...

209
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:41,180
your 'cop buddies' call you?

210
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,680
Yeah, my brother's on the...

211
00:14:43,681 --> 00:14:46,957
Shamberdoor Sheriffs.

212
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:47,958
- Yeah?

213
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:48,959
Yeah.

214
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:53,787
I got a little..
I got a thing for Cops.

215
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,059
Are you sure, you don't
have a thing for your brother?

216
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,060
What? No!

217
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,715
NO!

218
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:12,374
That was...very, very impressive.

219
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,375
No, thank you. I don't smoke.

220
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:16,271
You don't smoke?
- No, I don't need it.

221
00:15:17,353 --> 00:15:19,230
So, that wasn't as impressive as a..

222
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:22,501
- No, it was still very impressive trick.

223
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:23,502
Waiter: No smoking in here, Sir.

224
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:25,236
Jesus Christ!

225
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:28,529
You used to let me smoke in here.

226
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:30,922
Poor little rose.

227
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:33,005
That's for you.
- Woww!

228
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:34,806
I didn't get you anything.

229
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:37,013
I'm sure, you'll think of something.

230
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,480
So, come on, tell me.
What's your moniker?

231
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:45,756
What's it matter?

232
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:49,147
It matters. It tells everything
i need to know about you.

233
00:15:49,785 --> 00:15:52,338
Maybe a little bit more...

234
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,539
Oh, come on. Don't be shy.

235
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,390
What? Is it..uh is it?

236
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,259
uh..Rough House Dave?

237
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,714
Yeah?
- I like that.

238
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,840
or uh...Bang Bang Brown?

239
00:16:11,473 --> 00:16:12,662
Date Rape Dave.

240
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:15,893
Why is that?

241
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:20,792
Rumour from when I worked Hollywood sex,
That I can't comfirm it, nor I won't deny it.

242
00:16:23,018 --> 00:16:24,161
So, tell me.

243
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:28,879
Maybe, I killed a bad guy.
Maybe, I didn't.

244
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,621
By the way,
he got what he paid for,

245
00:16:33,622 --> 00:16:36,251
And he'll never hurt another woman,
ever again.

246
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,108
Oh.

247
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:42,109
Is that your foot?

248
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,480
Uhhh, yeah.

249
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,310
Oh, stop. Stop, stop.

250
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,900
Okay.

251
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,390
Good, go again.

252
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:55,250
Oh, well.

253
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:38,570
Hey, what's your fucking problem?

254
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,189
<i>TV: Brown was video taped.

00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,361
- Good, You?

277
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,362
Pretty good.

278
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,080
- Is someone still mad at me?

279
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,060
I don't know.

280
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:04,061
What are we watching?

281
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,420
Uhmm.

282
00:20:15,063 --> 00:20:16,015
Hey, did you do your homework?

283
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,750
No.

284
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,720
- Great idea.

285
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,700
How about we make this
a homework free day?

286
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,100
Not that you'll tell your mom.

287
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,751
And I'll just watch television?

288
00:20:29,752 --> 00:20:30,752
Okay.

289
00:20:30,753 --> 00:20:31,753
Alright, what do you wanna watch?

290
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:32,754
Is this good?

291
00:20:32,755 --> 00:20:33,755
Yeah.

292
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:34,756
Okay.

293
00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:45,773
Date rape!

294
00:21:49,784 --> 00:21:51,189
Thanks for making us look good, Dave.
- You're the man!

295
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,770
What's the word, Chief?

296
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,700
Close the door.

297
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:16,007
So, what would you like me to say, Al?

298
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:18,735
I'll..I'll say whatever I need to.

299
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,920
Have you thought about retirement?

300
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,211
Ahh, No.

301
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,579
In fact...uhm...

302
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,740
If you force me to retired filed on me,

303
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,710
I'll plead not guilty,
take it to trial and represent myself.

304
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,700
I'll be playing to mentally,

305
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,880
deficient jury,
So, I'll loose.

306
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,454
Though, I'll work
Vietnam for all it's worth.

307
00:22:46,455 --> 00:22:49,582
I'll have PTSD, DDT, TNT...

308
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:54,043
Ageing orange and the creeping
chinese crud before it's over..

309
00:22:54,044 --> 00:22:56,582
Not to mention,
twenty-four years on the job.

310
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,860
I'll draw a fine and a suspended sentence.

311
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,830
Court T.V will broadcast the whole thing,

312
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,390
I'll have my own show on Fox News
inside one week...

313
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,740
You'll be my first guest.

314
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,690
- So, you have thought about it?

315
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,680
I don't intend to retire,

316
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,680
Miss Confrey.

317
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,650
- Alright.

318
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,090
You know,
Rampart has become..

319
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,780
a shit storm of such
epic proportions.

320
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,590
Legally and financially.

321
00:23:23,591 --> 00:23:24,591
We have..

322
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,055
bullshit police brutality complains,

323
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:28,957
bullshit felony evidence plans...

324
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,563
Wrong door-fuck ups,

325
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:31,564
we have them all!

326
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,659
I have a ton of testimonies,
solicited and unsolicited;

327
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,420
that is, ambiguous... if not..
downright indecipherable.

328
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:41,450
County is going bankrupt,
paying lawsuit money.

329
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,891
The D.A's office and LAPD
are hemorrhaging prestige..

330
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:46,892
and a great many hardened criminals
are out on the street,

331
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,560
Way before, they should be.

332
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,600
And now..Dave,

333
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,570
We have you to deal with.

334
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,720
and we can't afford you.

335
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,350
So, how do we solve the problem
like Dave Brown? You tell me.

336
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,410
I was under attack.

337
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,006
I went after the suspect.

338
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:09,007
End of story.

339
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,390
A tape doesn't show everything,
they never do.

340
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,580
I had to neutralize him.
- The tape showed you...

341
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,450
brutally beating a man,
almost to dead.

342
00:24:20,847 --> 00:24:23,510
I think, on his part
it was an assault with a deadly weapon.

343
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,489
- You think, he drove
into you on purpose?

344
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,989
It was an assault
with a deadly weapon.

345
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,489
Okay, I got out of the car-
- It was an accident.

346
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,287
I intended to help the gentleman.

347
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:37,326
He opened the door into me
and he started running.

348
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:39,170
A lot of cops would've shot him
and got a medal.

349
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,424
I took it easy on him
and now I'm here before you.

350
00:24:42,425 --> 00:24:44,856
- I don't think, what we saw
was taking it easy on any one.

351
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,255
Correct me,
if I am wrong, Cal.

352
00:24:47,256 --> 00:24:48,256
But nine out of ten cops..

353
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:49,257
would've shot him, right there.

354
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,010
- Do you admit that
you over reacted?

355
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,070
You seem to have
everything under control here.

356
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,052
And uh, I do appreciate
the opportunity...

357
00:24:59,053 --> 00:25:00,053
Just remember,
which side you are on.

358
00:25:31,605 --> 00:25:34,772
You are wearing a court room suit
and you have litigator eyes.

359
00:25:34,773 --> 00:25:35,773
You here for me?

360
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,383
- Nope.

361
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:41,775
Dave.

362
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,380
- Linda.

363
00:25:48,186 --> 00:25:49,186
Gordy!

364
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:51,845
Isn't that game on?

365
00:25:51,846 --> 00:25:52,846
<i>- I can't find the clicker.</i>

366
00:25:56,941 --> 00:25:57,750
Tell me you are not a lawyer?

367
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,967
- Okay, I'm not a lawyer.

368
00:26:00,968 --> 00:26:03,670
Are you selling something...Art?

369
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,412
Insurance..Pharmaceuticals?

370
00:26:06,413 --> 00:26:07,413
- How about real estate?

371
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,289
Great.

372
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,290
- That's good.

373
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,430
- Yeah! I'm in from Phoenix..

374
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,890
My 87 years old hausband and..

375
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,559
he's taking six hour nap.
I'm taking a five hour walk...

376
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,679
How's that work for you?

377
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
- Oh, perfect.

378
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,559
I'm looking to refinance.

379
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,225
That's good.

380
00:26:24,972 --> 00:26:25,985
Gordy?

381
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,240
Anyway,

382
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,894
thank you for talking to me.

383
00:26:29,895 --> 00:26:30,895
Yeah, well...

384
00:26:30,896 --> 00:26:31,896
I figure,
I'll be safe. Everybody's..

385
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,480
watching your every move.

386
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,350
- Now they're watching you.

387
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,000
Maybe, I like being watched.

388
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,529
- I am watching you.

389
00:26:45,997 --> 00:26:48,408
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

390
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,620
In this bar.

391
00:27:43,374 --> 00:27:44,800
What're you doing?

392
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,090
- I gotta go.

393
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:48,950
Sneaking out of me?

394
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,793
You don't have to go.

395
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,794
- I gotta go.

396
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,239
Come here,
give me that purse.

397
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,240
- I gotta go.

398
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:58,559
You don't have to go anywhere.

399
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,560
No, you don't.

400
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,460
Okay,
I gotta go.

401
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,300
You have to stay.

402
00:28:24,063 --> 00:28:26,796
You're too famous for me,
all of a sudden?

403
00:28:26,797 --> 00:28:30,307
It's all..
deliberate provocation!

404
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:33,250
They predicted your response..

405
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,502
and you fell for it!

406
00:28:35,503 --> 00:28:36,503
- Who are they?

407
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,780
They?

408
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,270
They don't like you.

409
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,130
- Why me?

410
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,270
B'cos they don't like you.

411
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,632
Look, what do I know?

412
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:47,633
Maybe, it's a coincidence...

413
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,237
the camera was there.

414
00:28:50,238 --> 00:28:51,238
- Look? If this is the...

415
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:52,239
gang faux..

416
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,509
I don't mind.

417
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,629
generic..
criminal scum..

418
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,400
Bogus-lawsuits settlement scum,

419
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,283
Press Scum?

420
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:01,284
I can deal with scum.

421
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,309
But, this is Rampart..LAPD..

422
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,809
some fucking girly politician,

423
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:11,930
setting me up, as a shit magnet.
To take the heat off..the fucking scandal.

424
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,093
I gotta go deep into this.

425
00:29:14,094 --> 00:29:15,094
Look kid..
What can I do?

426
00:29:15,925 --> 00:29:20,081
I am just,
'a law abiding retiree',

427
00:29:20,082 --> 00:29:21,082
enjoying his golden years.

428
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:25,400
- Fuck you!
with the Micky Cohen routine, old man.

429
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,570
You got your fingers in more
department..

430
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,460
twat than,
any active cop i know.

431
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,535
Now,
Milk your contacts.

432
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,489
I got cash left,
from the Harris job.

433
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:37,490
Thanks, for that.
By the way.

434
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,440
You could, just stop.
Beating people up.

435
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,050
This isn't your father's
LAPD, you know.

436
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,376
I know...

437
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:54,720
It's more fun than
a barrel of monkies.

438
00:29:54,755 --> 00:29:57,099
It is a barrel of monkies!

439
00:30:01,362 --> 00:30:02,180
I'll get through it.

440
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,379
I always do.

441
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:09,191
You know, when you
first came into the department?

442
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:13,250
It wasn't certain whether or not,
you're the dumbest rookie ever..

443
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:18,220
Or the most bull-headed?

444
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,220
I'm still debating it.

445
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,309
- That's what my old man said about you.

446
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,455
'The most bull-headed man'
He's ever made.

447
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,207
I should've filed murder one on you,
for that Date Rape, shooting!

448
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:37,208
- I would've booked him on..

449
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:38,209
elevent counts, of rape...

450
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,623
sodomy one...
penetration of with a four...

451
00:30:40,624 --> 00:30:43,532
- Gentlemen..can we talk about
the present circumstances..

452
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:45,398
and not go back
to the ancient past?

453
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:46,399
I'd say, your punishment..

454
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,970
breached legal status..

455
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,813
as well as as moral code.

456
00:30:50,204 --> 00:30:53,379
<i>- 'The law must  acknowledge
and occationally accomodate the..</i>

457
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,879
<i> extraordinary vacisitudes of Justice.'</i>

458
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,210
Judge D.T Eagleton, 1946.

459
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,465
I don't know that quote.

460
00:31:01,466 --> 00:31:02,911
How could you..
You went to County State.

461
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,576
- Gentlemen...

462
00:31:03,577 --> 00:31:04,577
- Well, at least..
I passed the bar.

463
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,855
Knock it off!

464
00:31:05,856 --> 00:31:06,856
- Barely..I'm told.

465
00:31:06,857 --> 00:31:07,857
Hence, politics.

466
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,087
Should I break out
the millk and cookies here?

467
00:31:10,088 --> 00:31:11,088
Can we actually talk about...

468
00:31:11,089 --> 00:31:14,848
the possibility of you
holding a press conference together,

469
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,499
Addressing what's happened with
Mr.Parmaly..

470
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,999
Issuign an apology...
and moving on?

471
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,012
It would help
if I've done something wrong.

472
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,013
- Oh, you've done nothing wrong?

473
00:31:24,285 --> 00:31:26,991
Someone, planted
a camera in my way.

474
00:31:26,992 --> 00:31:29,279
Maybe, it's you.
Maybe, it's someone smart...

475
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,889
Definitely, smarter than me.
Because, I don't stop...

476
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,545
to see, if there's a photographer
nearby..while I do the people's dirty work.

477
00:31:35,546 --> 00:31:36,546
- So, you can't...

478
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:40,033
see yourself taking any responsibility,
that moves us beyond this?

479
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:41,034
- No. Because the only thing..

480
00:31:41,855 --> 00:31:42,920
that's wrong here. Is that,

481
00:31:42,921 --> 00:31:46,554
a camera caught him
doing police work.

482
00:31:46,589 --> 00:31:49,876
Is this a fucking joke to you?
You think, its funny?

483
00:31:49,877 --> 00:31:50,877
- What is funny and peculiar to me,

484
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,630
is how this office spends, all it's time..
going after decent cops.

485
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,090
Did you do it?

486
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,219
- Do what?

487
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,003
Without admitting, guilt or complicity.

488
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:06,821
Did you actually,
killed that rapist?

489
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,819
- Alleged rapist?

490
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,319
Did you do it?

491
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,020
- I don't live in the past.

492
00:32:15,021 --> 00:32:16,021
Is that a 'Yes'?

493
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,430
Let me re-phrase..

494
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,800
If you were to have done it.
Could you tell me why?

495
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,950
- So, women would love me.

496
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,070
I don't think,
the could be the reason.

497
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,891
It's too lame.

498
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:31,592
- I'm curious,
Why you're so curious.

499
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,568
Let's talk about it this weekend,
give me a call.

500
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,665
Brown..I have your number.

501
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,465
- I bet, you do.

502
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,970
What did you do to the captain?

503
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,020
What?

504
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,870
Come on, let's get
back to homework, honey.

505
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,760
Anything you wanna say to me?

506
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,805
What?

507
00:33:43,806 --> 00:33:46,594
As in, why am i
still collecting paycheck?

508
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,490
Shaundel skipped town.

509
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,900
His nerves are shot.
That civil lawsuit is still going forward.

510
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,140
Someone upstairs,
is pulling strings for you.

511
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,589
Close the door.

512
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,144
<i>Brown: I'm LAPD,
and I wanna stay LAPD.</i>

513
00:34:10,145 --> 00:34:11,145
That's the most important
thing for me.

514
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,800
- Why?

515
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:14,801
Why, what?

516
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,640
I'm just asking.

517
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,610
Why's staying a Cop,
the most important thing?

518
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,999
Becuase, I am a Hard-charging dutyful,

519
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,499
motherfucker..and I want to
explicate the LAPD

520
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,999
somewhat..hyperbolized, misdeed -

521
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,181
with true 'panache'
regarless of my alleged transgressions.

522
00:34:34,182 --> 00:34:35,182
Capisce ?

523
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,746
In other words,
I have nowhere else to go.

524
00:34:38,747 --> 00:34:41,933
So, If i get canned by the department,
I swear to God...

525
00:34:41,934 --> 00:34:43,768
I'll study for the bar, this time.

526
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:46,749
And work as your Token passes.

527
00:34:51,283 --> 00:34:52,312
- Well..

528
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,560
We'll need a retainer,

529
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,150
That's standard.

530
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,315
Have you seen my pick?

531
00:36:16,316 --> 00:36:17,316
No.

532
00:36:17,317 --> 00:36:18,317
Are you still mad at me?

533
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:19,318
Yeah.

534
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:20,319
Why? What did I do?

535
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,320
<i>Whatever.</i>

536
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:30,338
You didn't even finished it.

537
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:31,339
I just quit.

538
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,010
Right.

539
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:36,011
Hey!

540
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,930
You remember, when we used
to make up songs together?

541
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,255
You know,
like that one...

542
00:36:41,256 --> 00:36:42,256
<i>I want you.</i>

543
00:36:42,257 --> 00:36:43,257
<i>And, You want me...</i>

544
00:36:44,683 --> 00:36:47,300
<i>We..
We're always meant to be.</i>

545
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:50,350
<i>You are me..
and I am you,</i>

546
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:53,189
<i>And we're meant to see it through.</i>

547
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,689
- Nooo.
- You have to remember that!

548
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,023
I have no idea,
What you are talking about.

549
00:36:57,024 --> 00:36:58,024
- Let's take a walk!

550
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,830
Come on.
- No, I'm busy.

551
00:37:05,843 --> 00:37:06,789
How long have you been standing there?

552
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:12,720
<i>You are me.
I am you...</i>

553
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:22,752
Get out.

554
00:37:23,768 --> 00:37:24,921
Get out, Dave.

555
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,575
Yeah?

556
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:58,576
Hah!
Hey!

557
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,310
Back in town?

558
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,220
Yeah, it was fun.

559
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,600
What do you mean,
the truth?

560
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,780
Dave: So, you were lying
about everything?

561
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,785
Dave, we were playing
with each other.

562
00:38:20,786 --> 00:38:21,786
Come on!

563
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:25,036
I liked the way you moved. Okay?

564
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:26,037
That was it.

565
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:27,038
Like a John Wayne thing.

566
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,443
Or something...
I don't know.

567
00:38:28,444 --> 00:38:30,383
And I like to suck cock.

568
00:38:30,384 --> 00:38:31,384
So, sue me.

569
00:38:34,185 --> 00:38:36,450
Seemed like a fine idea,
at the time. Didn't it?

570
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,278
And you were asking for it. Dave..

571
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:40,815
You were asking for it,
'Tell me, you're not a lawyer.'

572
00:38:40,816 --> 00:38:41,816
I did.

573
00:38:43,215 --> 00:38:45,546
There's something you're
not telling me.

574
00:38:45,581 --> 00:38:47,811
What? That I hate the scum,
that i represent?

575
00:38:47,812 --> 00:38:48,812
Okay, I told you.

576
00:38:48,813 --> 00:38:50,729
And, when I was at the D.A's office?

577
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:53,123
At least, I got
to see this guys go down.

578
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:54,124
That's not it.

579
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,125
Dave?

580
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,147
I helped, Criminals go free!

581
00:38:58,148 --> 00:38:59,967
With County's cash
in their fucking pockets.

582
00:38:59,968 --> 00:39:00,968
B'cos, LAPD fucks up!

583
00:39:01,915 --> 00:39:03,440
And, eight times out of ten.

584
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,468
They are right back,
at Rampart again.

585
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:08,438
- You're giving me a closing statement.

586
00:39:09,005 --> 00:39:10,600
You came looking for me.

587
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:11,601
No, I didn't!

588
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:14,560
- What is it that you're not telling me?

589
00:39:15,205 --> 00:39:17,709
You are either lying to me
or you're withholding.

590
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,710
This is what I do.

591
00:39:28,245 --> 00:39:30,177
The guy that you killed.

592
00:39:30,178 --> 00:39:31,178
The guy...
the date rape guy.

593
00:39:33,915 --> 00:39:36,720
Look I'm the Defense Attorney, Okay?
And I'm not supposed to...

594
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:40,125
But, I respect..
What you did.

595
00:39:46,028 --> 00:39:46,941
I'm sorry.

596
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,095
Don't proof I killed anyone.

597
00:39:56,975 --> 00:39:58,120
I have daughters.

598
00:40:01,587 --> 00:40:02,883
I'm sorry.

599
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,635
Can I sleep with you, tonight?

600
00:40:22,377 --> 00:40:23,489
Yes.

601
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:57,040
Nice surprise!

602
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,000
Hello.

603
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,510
Is she any good?

604
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,000
She was.

605
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,180
I gotta talk to you.

606
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,300
Can it wait?

607
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:12,820
Nope.

608
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,400
I'm kinda busy right now.

609
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,200
We gotta put the houses in the market.

610
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,360
You gotta start thinking
about finding another place to live, okay?

611
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,670
No.

612
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,120
That's not okay.

613
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,530
You gotta do it,
this isn't working.

614
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,375
You can't do that.

615
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,532
Everybody living on top of each other,
like this...

616
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:45,748
You know it isn't working,
as well as I do.

617
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,340
We gotta...

618
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,280
- Don't do that.
- We gotta go our own ways!

619
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:54,040
You can't make the decisions
for us, anymore.

620
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,790
You'll get a lot of scope.

621
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,420
That's not acceptable.

622
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,120
I gotta keep everybody together.

623
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,672
- I know.
- All this is gonna blow over.

624
00:42:04,673 --> 00:42:05,673
I promise you.

625
00:42:05,674 --> 00:42:06,674
I know.

626
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,940
You've been trying to keep us
together, for a long time.

627
00:42:08,941 --> 00:42:09,941
But we gotta know
it won't let.

628
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,450
You gotta let us go.

629
00:42:23,483 --> 00:42:24,201
- Don't say that.
- You gotta let us go.

630
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:27,310
I'll never let you go.

631
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,280
I'm never letting you go.

632
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:44,139
They all know, someone like me
is more dangerous on the winess stand,

633
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,140
then on the streets.

634
00:42:46,045 --> 00:42:48,815
- Right?
- The way I see it, you gave 'em only one option.

635
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:52,674
Top brass is gonna try
to bury the beating in the scandal.

636
00:42:52,675 --> 00:42:55,174
And keep you as the side-show.

637
00:42:55,175 --> 00:42:58,630
Keep the press guessing,
while they investigate this into oblivion.

638
00:43:01,765 --> 00:43:03,508
Just, stick to the assault with
a deathly weapon routine,

639
00:43:03,509 --> 00:43:04,509
and they won't touch you.

640
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,995
- Well, I hope you're right.

641
00:43:07,775 --> 00:43:09,380
Meanwhile, I'm hemorrhaging cash.

642
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,380
I know that twich.

643
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:22,830
Okay.

644
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:29,866
There's gonna be
a high stakes card game.

645
00:43:29,867 --> 00:43:31,900
At the Crystal Market,

646
00:43:31,935 --> 00:43:33,137
tonight.

647
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,690
You didn't hear it from me, Buddy.

648
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:37,878
Thanks Hart.

649
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:39,916
You..you don't know...
How much this means to me.

650
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,418
I was gonna..
I was gonna mention it before.

651
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:43,419
But..

652
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,480
I wanna shape your realities.

653
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:53,850
I hate to see you bled
dry like that.

654
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,679
How're you doing?

655
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,679
Are you okay?

656
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,482
- I am fine.

657
00:44:04,483 --> 00:44:05,483
You are hanging in there.

658
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:09,050
- Hanging in there.
- You are hanging in there.

659
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,910
You're keeping it in a gold one.

660
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:17,580
<i>I'm in on this one.</i>

661
00:45:18,705 --> 00:45:20,025
<i>Twenty on that one.</i>

662
00:45:32,225 --> 00:45:33,430
Shut the fuck up!

663
00:45:34,345 --> 00:45:39,055
Don't even look up.
Look the fuck down!

664
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,370
Fuck!

665
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:24,960
What the..fuck!
I've got kids man...please.

666
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,891
Take off your mask!

667
00:46:26,892 --> 00:46:27,892
Alright, alright man!

668
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,620
Please, don't fucking shoot me, man!
Please, don't shoot me.

669
00:46:33,075 --> 00:46:35,242
- Get some money out of there.
- What'd I do it man?

670
00:46:35,243 --> 00:46:36,243
Put it in your fucking pocket.

671
00:46:36,805 --> 00:46:38,349
Hurry up!
God Damn It!!!

672
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:39,350
Go!

673
00:46:39,351 --> 00:46:40,351
GO!

674
00:47:37,242 --> 00:47:39,082
<i>Reporter: We're right outside,
Officer's Dave Brown.</i>

675
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:42,184
<i>Brown's involved in a high stake
card game robbery...</i>

676
00:47:58,495 --> 00:48:00,555
That's the part that gets me
the most upset, Mom.

677
00:48:00,556 --> 00:48:01,556
When you keep saying sorry.
- I know.

678
00:48:01,557 --> 00:48:03,807
<i>I'm sorry.
I am sorry!</i>

679
00:48:03,808 --> 00:48:04,808
Why do you feel bad?

680
00:48:04,809 --> 00:48:05,809
You didn't do anything!

681
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,446
What did you do?

682
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,637
- That's the point.
I didn't do anything, you know?

683
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:41,300
I'm sorry about the reporters.

684
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,410
Do you have cancer?

685
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,590
Hmm?

686
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,110
Cos, if you don't..
I'm done!

687
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,060
We are done.

688
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,920
He fired at me, three times.

689
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,519
I returned fire, in self defence.

690
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,520
It was self-defence.

691
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:02,610
I swear to God!

692
00:49:08,541 --> 00:49:09,507
You need rest.

693
00:49:09,508 --> 00:49:10,508
You need to eat.

694
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,820
I didn't know about the card games.

695
00:49:13,821 --> 00:49:15,751
I swear.

696
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,900
You need to set up shops,
someplace else.

697
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,750
Right now.

698
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,850
I talked to Barb.

699
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:31,047
<i><font color=#00FF00>Subtitle by D3xt3r</font></i>

700
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:43,927
Big Jim?

701
00:49:45,225 --> 00:49:46,930
Hookers that work the bar, weekends.

702
00:49:47,535 --> 00:49:50,015
Your call or I notify
Central Night Watch or I don't.

703
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:52,035
- You can't keep doing this, Dave.

704
00:49:53,655 --> 00:49:55,990
Just a scotch, a room...
and a wake-up call.

705
00:49:57,015 --> 00:49:58,475
- And loose my job?

706
00:49:59,315 --> 00:50:00,360
At least, you'll be on the outside.

707
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:16,031
Your Bun boy, honked a Vice Cop
with a pink pair last night.

708
00:50:16,032 --> 00:50:17,032
He's got a parole hold..

709
00:50:17,033 --> 00:50:18,033
So, no bail.

710
00:50:18,034 --> 00:50:21,798
Lorazepam and pinot bar up
and it all goes away.

711
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,690
We are taking a look
at your teams report.

712
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,805
It's a pretty extensive package.

713
00:52:05,806 --> 00:52:08,562
- Not germaine to the issue, Sir.

714
00:52:08,597 --> 00:52:10,660
I'd like the event to be judged, Ad-hoc.

715
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:15,440
Empirical knowledge often distorts,
the content of the act under scrutiny, Sir.

716
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,810
You are not making this easy.

717
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:20,510
And you are not making friends, here.

718
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:24,610
- I have all the friends
I need, at this stage of my life, Sir.

719
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:29,160
Describe the events that led up
to your use of deathly force, Officer Brown.

720
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,407
You are alive..

721
00:52:31,408 --> 00:52:32,408
And an individual named..

722
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:35,880
Jose Lancha Masias is dead.

723
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,980
How did that occur?

724
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,339
At approximately, 23-50 hours

725
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:49,090
I was parked in the South-East Corner
of the viewing street on Echo Park Avenue.

726
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:53,938
A man approached my patrol car
and stated that, he thought he had seen,

727
00:52:53,939 --> 00:52:56,251
a suspicious man in the adjacent alley.

728
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:00,430
The alley in question was
just to the West of my location.

729
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:05,433
At this time, I observed,
an unknown suspect with a gun...

730
00:53:05,434 --> 00:53:07,632
chasing another man,
who appeared to be unarmed.

731
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,528
I identified myself, verbally.

732
00:53:10,529 --> 00:53:12,988
And began, chasing the man
with the gun.

733
00:53:38,335 --> 00:53:39,865
Get off past me.

734
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,880
Who tipped you to the game?

735
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,904
- You know,
I can't give you that, Dave.

736
00:53:57,905 --> 00:53:58,905
You got a tip..

737
00:53:58,906 --> 00:53:59,906
I improvised.

738
00:54:01,462 --> 00:54:02,425
There's a man dead.

739
00:54:02,426 --> 00:54:03,426
How do you feel about that?

740
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:05,030
The streets were cleaner already.

741
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,850
LAPD is back in town.

742
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,140
And it's called, Dave Brown.

743
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:12,360
Where's your gratitude?

744
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,320
Glad I could help.

745
00:54:32,788 --> 00:54:34,186
I need to know.

746
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,187
Forget it, I can't.

747
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:38,037
I don't play games..
I don't name, names!

748
00:54:38,038 --> 00:54:39,038
SHhh.

749
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:41,989
Shhh, yourself!
God Damn it.

750
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:48,089
That's the way I handle it,

751
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:49,090
Do you understand?

752
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,800
- Yeah, that's a good motto.

753
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,810
What are the odds?

754
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:56,060
They go, when I go.

755
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:57,990
Same night...

756
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:00,338
To take that game down.

757
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,339
What're the odds?

758
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,480
You 'handled it' Dave.

759
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,310
Hooray!

760
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,373
- I could've got killed myself!

761
00:55:09,374 --> 00:55:10,374
You didn't.

762
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:16,838
- Huhh..I don't know
how much more of this shit, I can take.

763
00:55:32,358 --> 00:55:33,583
Jesus Christ!

764
00:55:33,618 --> 00:55:35,130
- Where the hell were you?
I left you six messages.

765
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,960
I'm not your fucking girlfriend,
My battery died.

766
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,397
- I nearly got killed myself,
the other night.

767
00:55:41,398 --> 00:55:43,898
While you were out,
looking for a bone to chew on.

768
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:46,010
Where the hell were you?

769
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,810
Fuck You!

770
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:04,930
You're insane, Dave.
You are insane.

771
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:07,370
- Well, guess what? Lyn,
It takes one to know one.

772
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,260
I want the truth.

773
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:16,450
You came after me,
that night.

774
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,670
Yeah, of course I fucking did.
You're the man of my dreams, right?

775
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:21,510
Who the hell are you working for?

776
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,590
You watch too much television.

777
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,351
I told you,
I am on your side!

778
00:56:26,352 --> 00:56:27,352
I'm not working
for anyone or anybody!

779
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:30,899
- You're paranoid, Dave.
- You are breaking my heart, linda.

780
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,570
Yeah?
You broke into my fucking house!

781
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,674
I located your security flaw.

782
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:37,816
- Oh, fuck you!
- Your pool gate was open.

783
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,955
Should I leave?

784
00:56:40,956 --> 00:56:41,956
- Mmmhm.

785
00:56:41,957 --> 00:56:42,957
Yeah.

786
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:59,000
I'm sorry.
I am a mess.

787
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:09,610
Will you sleep with me?

788
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:11,940
Just tonight?

789
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:23,640
No.

790
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:26,135
You drink too much.

791
00:57:26,136 --> 00:57:27,136
- Really?

792
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,380
You're great in the sack, Linda.

793
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,280
But, you're lying to be liked.

794
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,060
- Is that right?

795
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,690
That's right.

796
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:41,691
Yeah, well... guess what?

797
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:43,950
It takes one, to know one.

798
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:56,851
You are a bitch,
you know that?

799
00:57:56,852 --> 00:57:57,852
- Mmmhmm.

800
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:30,445
General!

801
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:32,030
Get over here, now.

802
00:58:47,647 --> 00:58:48,388
How're you doing?

803
00:58:48,423 --> 00:58:49,640
I'm okay, how are you?

804
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:52,595
I'm good.

805
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:56,955
How are you?

806
00:59:00,385 --> 00:59:01,760
Didn't we just go through this?

807
00:59:01,761 --> 00:59:02,761
Good.

808
00:59:06,982 --> 00:59:07,662
Hey?

809
00:59:07,697 --> 00:59:08,715
Look at me.

810
00:59:09,815 --> 00:59:11,465
Look me right in the eye.

811
00:59:15,155 --> 00:59:16,585
Have you seen anything, unusual lately?

812
00:59:18,259 --> 00:59:18,930
- NO.

813
00:59:18,965 --> 00:59:19,965
Anything around the Chrystal Market?

814
00:59:19,966 --> 00:59:20,966
No, I said no.

815
00:59:20,967 --> 00:59:21,967
I didn't see shit.

816
00:59:23,404 --> 00:59:24,083
Sure?

817
00:59:24,118 --> 00:59:25,256
Yeah.

818
00:59:25,445 --> 00:59:27,015
Are you positive?

819
00:59:27,016 --> 00:59:28,016
Not a damn thing.

820
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,134
Thanks.

821
00:59:39,936 --> 00:59:41,089
Yeah, take two.

822
00:59:43,475 --> 00:59:44,575
Look, what happened to your head?

823
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:55,120
Watch that beard.

824
00:59:57,535 --> 01:00:00,157
I don't wanna see you,
go up in smoke.

825
01:00:04,777 --> 01:00:05,924
This dick head cops,
throw flashlights on me...

826
01:00:11,095 --> 01:00:12,650
Fuck!
Don't do that!

827
01:00:13,921 --> 01:00:15,283
Keeping the streets safe.

828
01:00:20,963 --> 01:00:22,187
I'm not hurting anybody.

829
01:00:23,785 --> 01:00:25,645
I don't sell no more,
don't smoke no more.

830
01:00:25,646 --> 01:00:28,157
No big deal.
I'm nobody, nobody..Im nothing.

831
01:00:34,678 --> 01:00:38,379
You got fucking niggers,
swinging golf balls up and down this streets.

832
01:00:39,158 --> 01:00:44,276
They all talk,
gabby gabby, gabbygaby.

833
01:00:44,277 --> 01:00:45,277
They wanna crack my head open.

834
01:00:49,259 --> 01:00:50,558
Asshole, Cop.

835
01:00:52,495 --> 01:00:55,375
Give me a sip.

836
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,435
Give me a sip.

837
01:01:13,515 --> 01:01:14,665
Here.

838
01:01:17,085 --> 01:01:18,835
Call this lawyer,
Sue the LAPD.

839
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,485
Linda.

840
01:01:22,395 --> 01:01:23,560
Is she hot?

841
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,155
Linda Fentress?

842
01:01:27,035 --> 01:01:28,525
She's blond all over.

843
01:01:28,526 --> 01:01:29,526
- Fuck...yeah!

844
01:01:29,645 --> 01:01:31,190
Why..your thing still working?

845
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,675
No.

846
01:01:35,675 --> 01:01:36,520
Not really.

847
01:01:37,265 --> 01:01:38,810
My stock(?)Nanny's the best pussy.

848
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,590
You don't have any brothers?

849
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:45,915
Huh?

850
01:01:45,916 --> 01:01:47,981
You're my brother.

851
01:01:54,251 --> 01:01:54,550
Keep it.

852
01:01:57,135 --> 01:01:58,295
Brother.

853
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,605
Hey!
- Can I help you?

854
01:02:10,606 --> 01:02:11,606
Let me get a...

855
01:02:12,475 --> 01:02:15,530
Six shrimps.

856
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:47,356
You fucking with me?

857
01:02:47,357 --> 01:02:48,357
- What?

858
01:02:50,195 --> 01:02:51,466
I'm listening.

859
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,346
What are you..I.A?

860
01:02:54,155 --> 01:02:57,375
- Man, i'm just sitting here,
trying to get my shrimp.

861
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,085
Is that what you're gonna say,
the next time I spot you?

862
01:03:00,885 --> 01:03:02,360
- Here we go.

863
01:03:03,081 --> 01:03:04,081
Here we go.

864
01:03:05,905 --> 01:03:07,105
Kyle Timkins, DIA investigator.

865
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:09,545
You said both robbers escaped,

866
01:03:10,485 --> 01:03:11,690
That's kinda hard to believe.

867
01:03:13,045 --> 01:03:14,525
Also, there's a big gap.

868
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,661
Between the time..
the neighbours said they heard the shots..

869
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:19,662
and you reported the incident.

870
01:03:21,678 --> 01:03:22,406
Also...

871
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:27,186
It's kinda strange..that
you'd be in that location, without your radio.

872
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:29,372
Why is the robbery unit on this?

873
01:03:29,373 --> 01:03:31,617
When both robbers
did indeed escaped?

874
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:35,100
- Well, your recent misconduct..

875
01:03:35,101 --> 01:03:36,101
Perceived, misconduct.

876
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,590
- Perceived misconduct.

877
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:41,909
Brings into question,
your mental state,

878
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:42,837
on the night of the incident.

879
01:03:42,838 --> 01:03:43,838
That's why, I am here.

880
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:47,379
Oh, listen...Jack?

881
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:48,380
- No, I'm Kyle.

882
01:03:50,181 --> 01:03:50,977
Listen, Jack.

883
01:03:52,175 --> 01:03:54,240
You got this assignment,
because...

884
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:57,675
I am controversial and your ancestors
were restored from Africa.

885
01:03:59,785 --> 01:04:03,801
You got this assignment,
to cover the department on perceived...

886
01:04:03,802 --> 01:04:04,802
racial bias.

887
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:07,090
Pertaining to Shaudel J.Parmley
and other shit-faced scum.

888
01:04:09,385 --> 01:04:11,595
You're mad as hell..
and you want me to know it.

889
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:14,283
While you're playing 'Gumshoe'..

890
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:17,069
bear in mind,
that i'm not a racist.

891
01:04:17,915 --> 01:04:20,167
The fact is,
I hate all people.

892
01:04:20,202 --> 01:04:20,840
Equally.

893
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,884
And if it helps...

894
01:04:23,885 --> 01:04:24,885
I've slept with
some of your people.

895
01:04:26,765 --> 01:04:28,449
Now, you wanna be mad at someone?

896
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:29,450
Try, J.Edgar Hoover.

897
01:04:29,451 --> 01:04:30,451
He was a racist.

898
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,886
Or the founding fathers.
All slave owners.

899
01:04:33,887 --> 01:04:34,887
Me?

900
01:04:34,888 --> 01:04:35,888
I'm just doing my job.

901
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:38,275
- All that may be true.

902
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:42,581
But, we're not here talking about me.

903
01:04:42,582 --> 01:04:43,582
We are here talking about you.

904
01:04:43,855 --> 01:04:44,890
Okay?

905
01:04:48,962 --> 01:04:50,127
Oh, Officer Hoover?

906
01:04:51,568 --> 01:04:52,853
I got another question.

907
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:56,772
Why are you still
with the department?

908
01:04:56,807 --> 01:05:00,528
After all this shit that's going on.

909
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:04,145
The Mayor..The D.A -
The Chief of Police...

910
01:05:05,325 --> 01:05:06,695
Why do they still have you around?

911
01:05:10,785 --> 01:05:14,390
It must be cos,
I'm innocent.

912
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,325
Nice to meet you, Kyle.

913
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:29,769
Y'all see, you know..
that I didn't wanna be no gangbanger,

914
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:30,770
walking down the street.
Pull downed by their dogs.

915
01:05:29,804 --> 01:05:32,605
Hey, Boss?
Boss.

916
01:05:39,291 --> 01:05:40,177
Dave?

917
01:05:42,795 --> 01:05:44,230
Stayed up well late, last night?

918
01:05:50,325 --> 01:05:51,335
How are you feeling?

919
01:05:54,505 --> 01:05:55,980
Just waiting to piss all these protestor.

920
01:05:58,405 --> 01:05:59,695
You know,
you are being watched?

921
01:06:01,555 --> 01:06:03,550
What do you mean?

922
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,920
<i>There he goes.</i>

923
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:06,921
<i>There he goes.</i>

924
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,460
I am glad, you found me.

925
01:06:24,423 --> 01:06:25,481
- It wasn't hard.

926
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:26,800
I just wanted to see for myself.

927
01:06:27,545 --> 01:06:30,865
Mom said you are deeper
in this shit.

928
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,095
Those are my words, not hers.

929
01:06:37,057 --> 01:06:38,803
People keep telling me that.

930
01:06:38,804 --> 01:06:39,804
- Well, maybe..it's true then.

931
01:06:43,112 --> 01:06:44,015
You took a cab, right?

932
01:06:44,016 --> 01:06:46,333
Tell me, you didn't take a bus
all the way out here...

933
01:06:46,334 --> 01:06:47,334
in the God damn jungle.

934
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:49,432
- It's the barrio, Dad.

935
01:06:49,433 --> 01:06:50,433
It's not a fucking jungle.

936
01:06:50,325 --> 01:06:52,426
- Yes, I took the bus.
- I told you a thousand times, babe...

937
01:06:52,427 --> 01:06:53,427
I don't want you taking...

938
01:06:52,825 --> 01:06:54,586
Don't call me Babe!

939
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:57,225
It's disgusting.

940
01:06:59,655 --> 01:07:01,458
How's uh...

941
01:07:03,832 --> 01:07:04,804
How is school?

942
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:10,583
- It sucks.

943
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:14,205
Full of uh..

944
01:07:15,545 --> 01:07:18,270
Candy Ass, Future Fags
and Dykes like me.

945
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:22,260
Those are your word.
Not mine.

946
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,735
I never said that.

947
01:07:28,745 --> 01:07:30,230
How's it going, at home?

948
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:36,120
What've they done to you?

949
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:38,870
She's angry.

950
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,695
She said, it's something everyday,
Brown daughter has to go through.

951
01:07:45,545 --> 01:07:46,905
You are a dinosaur, Date Rape.

952
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:50,310
You're a Classic Racist.

953
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:52,290
A Bigot.

954
01:07:52,291 --> 01:07:54,798
A Sexist.

955
01:07:54,975 --> 01:07:57,160
A Womeniser,
A Chauvinist...

956
01:07:57,815 --> 01:08:00,560
A Misentroph.

957
01:08:01,425 --> 01:08:04,155
Homophobic, clearly or maybe,
you just don't like yourself.

958
01:08:10,175 --> 01:08:11,565
How long did it take you
to rehearse that?

959
01:08:43,337 --> 01:08:44,579
Well, say something.

960
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:46,700
Don't touch me. Say something.

961
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:52,389
Well, I'll drive you home.

962
01:08:54,929 --> 01:08:56,286
No. I don't wanna go home.

963
01:08:56,844 --> 01:08:59,093
Thriving in an open house,
I don't wanna be around those heidious people.

964
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:00,094
I wanna be at Joe's.

965
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,379
Joe Joseph or Joe Jones?

966
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,200
I'll jsut take the bus!

967
01:09:06,201 --> 01:09:07,201
Helen?
I'm kidding!

968
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,199
Yeah?

969
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,200
<i>Your phone is tapped.</i>

970
01:09:27,201 --> 01:09:28,201
<i>Don't say a word.</i>

971
01:09:29,883 --> 01:09:32,974
<i>Jesus, the shits
i have to take care of because of you.</i>

972
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,292
<i>You are just like your father, Dave.</i>

973
01:09:35,293 --> 01:09:37,892
<i>You're think,
you are smarter than you are.</i>

974
01:09:37,927 --> 01:09:41,680
Every shooting
testimony contains, Inconsistencies.

975
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:43,540
Otherwise, you wouldn't have a job.

976
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,872
No man, whoever
shoots and kills another man,

977
01:09:46,873 --> 01:09:48,811
is entirely coached in,
in the moment.

978
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:51,850
No plans survives contact,
with the enemy.

979
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,887
- Did you learn that,
with the first man you killed?

980
01:09:54,888 --> 01:09:59,074
I learned that serving my country,
as a non electic pop up target.

981
01:09:59,075 --> 01:10:03,765
In an often misunderstood crusade
for liberty and justice...

982
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,534
turned puppet show for politicians,
known as the Vietnam War.

983
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:12,224
Let's fast forward to the present.

984
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:14,865
Why are you looking to hang me?
Why me?

985
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:16,513
I know you're setting me up.

986
01:10:16,514 --> 01:10:17,514
Blood was gutted in for me.

987
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:21,311
Answer my question,
of all the truly rotten cops out there...

988
01:10:21,312 --> 01:10:23,677
Why, why are you
after the one guy who gets it?

989
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:26,449
The one cop who gets it?

990
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:28,306
Are you fucking kidding me?

991
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:31,118
Let me remind you,
that several years ago..

992
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:35,590
You killed an alledged
serial Date rapist, premeditatively?

993
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,990
Did you know that,
he had a wife and three small children?

994
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:43,255
She had a nervous breakdown after his death,
and ended up in an insane asylum,

995
01:10:43,256 --> 01:10:45,561
where she spend nine years,
until she cut her wrist.

996
01:10:45,562 --> 01:10:47,388
With a disposable razor blade.

997
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:49,610
The kids were raised, by the way..
in foster homes.

998
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:52,215
Two of them have alleged that,
they were...

999
01:10:52,216 --> 01:10:54,465
sexually abused
by their foster fathers.

1000
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:56,517
So, please..
don't come in here.

1001
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:57,518
Whining!

1002
01:10:57,850 --> 01:10:59,430
Took a lot of nerve.

1003
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:05,563
Up this time.

1004
01:11:05,564 --> 01:11:06,564
Something to make it hard!

1005
01:14:55,612 --> 01:14:56,904
Watch it, man.

1006
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,460
I feel like....

1007
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:09,780
Dave, what are you doing here?

1008
01:15:13,327 --> 01:15:14,261
Listen,

1009
01:15:14,296 --> 01:15:15,000
My lawyers...

1010
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,560
are burning throuh my money and,

1011
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:20,830
uh..we're gonna have to tighten our belts.

1012
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:24,370
We..we're gonna have
a trial date soon. So,

1013
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,690
What were...
What are you even doing here, Dave?

1014
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,760
I came to talk to you about this.

1015
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:32,687
You don't live here anymore. You can't just walk
in the house like, you still live here.

1016
01:15:32,688 --> 01:15:33,688
Oh, for God's sake.

1017
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:37,090
You know what I think?

1018
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:39,690
I think, you're a dirty cop
from day one.

1019
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:45,050
You're a dirty cop,
with a dirty mind and you dirtied...

1020
01:15:45,051 --> 01:15:46,051
all of us, by default.

1021
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:49,479
I think..you think,
you can just ride this out!

1022
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,979
Thinking you can go back to
your fucking...

1023
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:56,210
Tough guy..
law and order bullshit!

1024
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:58,980
It's over, Dave.
It's over!

1025
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:01,617
You know what happened to you?
- Just let him go.

1026
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:08,239
Just let him go.
Just let him get out.

1027
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,739
Selfish man, Dave!
- It's not worth it. Just let him go.

1028
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:13,239
You're a bad hausband.
You're a bad father..

1029
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,739
you're bad lay.

1030
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:18,430
And all this...all this man,
keeping the family together, bullshit.

1031
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:20,760
It only fucks the girls up, forever.

1032
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:22,770
Forever.

1033
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:30,800
You don't know what...
one thing about your girls...

1034
01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:34,577
You're a fraud.

1035
01:16:34,578 --> 01:16:35,578
You gotta go.

1036
01:16:35,579 --> 01:16:36,579
Okay.

1037
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:36,395
I'm..I'm thirsty.

1038
01:17:36,396 --> 01:17:37,396
I bet you are.

1039
01:17:37,397 --> 01:17:39,429
Come on, just give me a pull.

1040
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:40,430
just give me a pull.

1041
01:17:40,431 --> 01:17:42,998
Get your fucking hand,
out of the car.

1042
01:17:42,999 --> 01:17:43,999
Come on, you're by bro...

1043
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Come on.
Just a sip.

1044
01:17:45,001 --> 01:17:46,001
a sip...

1045
01:17:48,175 --> 01:17:49,335
Give me a smoke.

1046
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:52,364
Give me a smoke.

1047
01:17:52,365 --> 01:17:53,365
I want a cigerette.

1048
01:17:53,366 --> 01:17:54,366
Give me a cigerette.

1049
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:56,870
No.
- Yeah, C'mon..give me a drink.

1050
01:17:58,038 --> 01:17:59,485
Sober up.

1051
01:18:03,415 --> 01:18:05,750
Linda is a good woman,
she's taking really good care of me.

1052
01:18:06,465 --> 01:18:07,630
I'm gonna take all your
asshole friends, Down!

1053
01:18:11,571 --> 01:18:13,647
Can you spot me a fiver?
I don't feel so hot.

1054
01:18:14,235 --> 01:18:16,734
Sell your wheelchair.

1055
01:18:16,735 --> 01:18:17,770
Fuck you, White skin.

1056
01:18:18,566 --> 01:18:19,589
I got robbed.

1057
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:27,680
I need a blanket.

1058
01:18:32,913 --> 01:18:33,585
Five bucks, please.

1059
01:18:35,505 --> 01:18:37,154
Do I look like,
Santa Claus to you?

1060
01:18:37,155 --> 01:18:39,326
No, you don't look like Santa Claus,
You're my brother...

1061
01:18:39,327 --> 01:18:40,327
Us, guys stick together.

1062
01:18:40,505 --> 01:18:41,614
Don't leave a man behind.

1063
01:18:43,005 --> 01:18:44,573
- I'm not your brother, okay?
- Yes, you are.

1064
01:18:44,574 --> 01:18:45,574
I'll pay you back.

1065
01:18:48,170 --> 01:18:50,115
I'll pay you back.
When, Linda and I make a killing.

1066
01:18:50,116 --> 01:18:51,987
Stop saying her name!
- Linda.

1067
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:53,830
You stop saying her name, okay?

1068
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:55,740
Say her name one more time..
- You don't get it.

1069
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:58,187
- I will, hurt you.
- You don't fucking get it.

1070
01:18:58,188 --> 01:18:59,188
We're gonna be rich as shit.

1071
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,709
I'm gonna go around the world.
Round the world...round the world.

1072
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:07,873
Round the world...round the world.

1073
01:19:09,695 --> 01:19:10,742
I'm gonna tell my story.

1074
01:19:10,743 --> 01:19:11,743
And they're gonna fucking pay me.

1075
01:19:11,744 --> 01:19:13,635
I'm gonna be on talk shows,

1076
01:19:13,636 --> 01:19:14,636
I'm gonna have a suit.

1077
01:19:14,575 --> 01:19:15,625
What did you tell her?

1078
01:19:16,295 --> 01:19:17,415
I told her everything.

1079
01:19:17,416 --> 01:19:18,416
Tell me, exactly..
what you've told her.

1080
01:19:18,705 --> 01:19:21,136
I told her my plan,
about...

1081
01:19:21,137 --> 01:19:22,137
We're gonna get a big house, together.

1082
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:24,935
Somewhere, in Northern California.

1083
01:19:24,936 --> 01:19:25,936
On a lot of property...

1084
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,259
Where anybody can come.
Who needs a place, Has a place.

1085
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:30,242
Where you can shower..
Where you can hang out.

1086
01:19:30,575 --> 01:19:31,797
Or where you can just get your head right.

1087
01:19:31,798 --> 01:19:32,798
All my friends are gonna be there...

1088
01:19:33,075 --> 01:19:34,681
So, you should definitely come.

1089
01:19:34,682 --> 01:19:35,682
And Linda would make us eggs.

1090
01:19:36,718 --> 01:19:38,109
What about the Crystal Market?

1091
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:39,110
Yeah.

1092
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:40,424
I told her everything.

1093
01:19:40,425 --> 01:19:41,425
Everything?

1094
01:19:41,426 --> 01:19:42,426
Everything.

1095
01:19:45,161 --> 01:19:46,237
Come on, give me a drink.

1096
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:48,780
Get the fuck out of here!

1097
01:20:18,173 --> 01:20:19,426
What the hell are you doing?

1098
01:20:21,865 --> 01:20:22,885
Why? You afraid of something?

1099
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:25,235
Come inside, Dave.

1100
01:20:25,236 --> 01:20:26,236
C'mon, it's raining.

1101
01:20:26,195 --> 01:20:27,290
Yeah, I can see that.

1102
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:29,540
I'm already in,
what does it matter?

1103
01:20:31,690 --> 01:20:33,333
What are you doing?

1104
01:20:33,334 --> 01:20:35,231
General, told you.

1105
01:20:36,001 --> 01:20:37,812
Who?

1106
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:41,380
He saw me shoot that man,
in Crystal Market.

1107
01:20:41,381 --> 01:20:42,381
And dropped a piece on him.

1108
01:20:43,285 --> 01:20:45,955
Baby, I don't wanna hear this.
Come on, it's raining. Come inside.

1109
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,290
He got rough up by the LAPD.
That's all.

1110
01:20:49,105 --> 01:20:50,660
You're gonna believe him,
over me?

1111
01:20:51,865 --> 01:20:53,023
Get in,
get in the pool.

1112
01:20:53,024 --> 01:20:54,659
I'm not getting in the fucking pool.

1113
01:20:54,694 --> 01:20:55,968
No..no.

1114
01:20:55,969 --> 01:20:57,708
If you're on my side,
get in the fucking pool.

1115
01:20:57,709 --> 01:20:58,709
No, you've gone crazy.

1116
01:20:59,020 --> 01:20:59,905
I'm going in.

1117
01:20:59,906 --> 01:21:00,906
Get in the fucking pool.

1118
01:21:00,907 --> 01:21:03,373
I'm going in.
You make the next move.

1119
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,180
Don't fucking touch me.

1120
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:08,380
- Get off.
- If you're on my side, get in the pool.

1121
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,699
Come in.

1122
01:21:24,073 --> 01:21:25,659
You think,
you can take me down?

1123
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,620
I don't need you.

1124
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:29,360
I don't need anyone!

1125
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:33,970
I'm just a fucking cop.

1126
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:38,310
I'm a fucking soldier.
I'm dispensible.

1127
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:41,940
There're lot of other
cocks to suck.

1128
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:44,340
You are heartless, Linda.

1129
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:46,170
You played me.

1130
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:47,890
I hate you!

1131
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:50,170
I fucking hate you!

1132
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:52,500
Are you even listening, you bitch?

1133
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,570
Get in the fucking pool!

1134
01:22:00,846 --> 01:22:03,825
Kyle: Discrepencies...and inconsistencies.

1135
01:22:03,826 --> 01:22:04,826
<i>- Jesus.</i>

1136
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,837
Dave, I got six card players.
All of them claiming...

1137
01:22:08,838 --> 01:22:11,101
that it was a 'no weapons' game.

1138
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:13,319
Four of them heard the shots.

1139
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:16,671
All of them claimed,
it was two sets of three pops.

1140
01:22:16,672 --> 01:22:18,681
All at the same clip.

1141
01:22:19,376 --> 01:22:20,450
Which indicates...

1142
01:22:20,451 --> 01:22:22,293
You fired your weapon, first.

1143
01:22:22,294 --> 01:22:23,294
Right?

1144
01:22:23,295 --> 01:22:24,295
Now, i traced the gun...

1145
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:27,590
Right back to this station.
Right here.

1146
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:31,522
Ballistic, showed that
the gun was involved...

1147
01:22:31,523 --> 01:22:33,929
in another,
officer shooting.

1148
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:34,930
Alright?

1149
01:22:34,931 --> 01:22:38,114
So, I'm sweating
...? to gun..

1150
01:22:38,115 --> 01:22:39,115
Cos not only can I prove...

1151
01:22:39,116 --> 01:22:41,621
that his shooting was dirty...

1152
01:22:41,622 --> 01:22:44,121
I can prove..
that your shooting was dirty.

1153
01:22:44,122 --> 01:22:46,459
Just like i can prove...
YOU dirty!

1154
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:48,340
I got two eye witnesses.

1155
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:51,429
That saw your ass,
outside of that crystal market.

1156
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:53,151
Right before, you jump off.

1157
01:22:53,152 --> 01:22:55,415
So, go home and pack a bag.

1158
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,760
Make sure there's a wet suit in there.

1159
01:22:57,761 --> 01:23:00,223
Cos, I'm sending your ass
up the river.

1160
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,090
Oh, come on baby.

1161
01:23:03,091 --> 01:23:04,795
I've been up the river, motherfucker.

1162
01:23:04,830 --> 01:23:07,510
When you were still
sucking on your mother's tits.

1163
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:09,315
My mother died,
when i was born.

1164
01:23:09,316 --> 01:23:11,244
You racist, son of a bitch!

1165
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:19,260
You save that grand wizard shit,
for the jury.

1166
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,540
I need you to help me
put a leash on Kyle Timkins.

1167
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:05,950
Help you?

1168
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:09,100
That's all I do is help.

1169
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:11,620
I'm not the help.

1170
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,550
Crystal Market.

1171
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:18,368
Again, with the market.

1172
01:24:18,369 --> 01:24:20,667
No. Still... with the market.

1173
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:25,313
You're covering for someone,
who's trying to bury me.

1174
01:24:25,314 --> 01:24:26,314
Now..

1175
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,900
I'm not sure I understand 
the rules, okay?

1176
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:31,690
The rules...change.

1177
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:35,050
The Laws change..the peoples change.

1178
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,180
They're accomodate, 
they adapt.

1179
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,496
But, not you?

1180
01:24:41,497 --> 01:24:42,497
Why is that?

1181
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:46,601
Explain to me, exactly...
what happened at the Chrystal Market?

1182
01:24:46,602 --> 01:24:47,602
I gotta get away from you.

1183
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:53,544
I got a business to protect,
contacts...

1184
01:24:55,769 --> 01:24:56,577
I don't know you.

1185
01:24:56,612 --> 01:24:57,774
I don't know...

1186
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:01,985
Put that away.

1187
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:04,699
- Why me, Harv?

1188
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:05,700
Why me?

1189
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,019
Stop whining.

1190
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,467
Why you?
Why me?

1191
01:25:09,468 --> 01:25:10,468
Why anybody!

1192
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:12,340
You set me up!

1193
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,850
You...set yourself up, Dave.

1194
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:17,726
Give me the gun.

1195
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:20,230
Give me the gun.

1196
01:26:14,895 --> 01:26:16,135
<i>Call an ambulance.</i>

1197
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:15,510
Hey!

1198
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:18,106
Come in.

1199
01:27:18,107 --> 01:27:19,107
What was that noise?

1200
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:21,653
- It's uh..the lock.

1201
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,357
Come on.

1202
01:27:23,358 --> 01:27:24,358
Come in.

1203
01:27:24,359 --> 01:27:25,359
Get out of the hallway.

1204
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:26,360
Please.

1205
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,820
Come on.

1206
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:31,009
Hey..

1207
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:32,410
What a surprise.

1208
01:27:36,171 --> 01:27:37,198
Do you wanna give it to him?

1209
01:27:37,233 --> 01:27:38,170
I thought you wanted to?

1210
01:27:38,171 --> 01:27:39,171
No.

1211
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:50,830
These are for you.

1212
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:53,450
Thank you.

1213
01:27:54,690 --> 01:27:56,080
How are you?

1214
01:27:56,081 --> 01:27:57,081
Good.

1215
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:57,770
Yeah?

1216
01:28:07,930 --> 01:28:09,790
So, tell me...uhh..

1217
01:28:11,170 --> 01:28:12,380
What you've been upto?

1218
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:17,715
Nothing, we just came
 by to drop off those clothes.

1219
01:28:23,050 --> 01:28:24,110
You found me!

1220
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:29,560
How did you do that?

1221
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:35,870
There's a caller I.D.

1222
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:39,000
What?

1223
01:28:39,001 --> 01:28:40,001
Caller ID??

1224
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:42,223
You called the house, from here.

1225
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:43,850
That's...

1226
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:45,700
that's good police work.

1227
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:48,520
Yeah, it was really hard.

1228
01:28:51,663 --> 01:28:52,557
So?

1229
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,450
Here you are.

1230
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:57,949
Come on in.

1231
01:28:57,950 --> 01:28:58,950
Don't be afraid.

1232
01:28:58,951 --> 01:28:59,951
You wanna sit?

1233
01:28:59,952 --> 01:29:00,952
No.

1234
01:29:00,953 --> 01:29:01,953
Can I get you a soda?

1235
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:03,953
No. I'm good.

1236
01:29:03,954 --> 01:29:04,954
Yeah?

1237
01:29:07,610 --> 01:29:09,408
You don't want anything?

1238
01:29:09,409 --> 01:29:10,409
Noo..I'm good.

1239
01:29:18,732 --> 01:29:19,843
You look beautiful.

1240
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:21,650
Both of you.

1241
01:29:32,038 --> 01:29:33,256
Your face looks red.

1242
01:29:36,982 --> 01:29:38,308
Too much sun.

1243
01:29:38,309 --> 01:29:39,309
It means, he's been drinking.

1244
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:45,088
Haven't you?

1245
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:46,671
What?

1246
01:29:47,458 --> 01:29:48,978
You've been drinking.

1247
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:50,690
Uh, just a..

1248
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:52,760
yeah, little bit.

1249
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:59,330
Okay...wow.

1250
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:03,640
Do you want to go.

1251
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:05,280
Yeah.

1252
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,700
Let's go.

1253
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:09,750
We're gonna go.

1254
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:13,742
Okay, you wanna then,
talk a little bit?

1255
01:30:13,743 --> 01:30:14,743
No. It's fine.

1256
01:30:14,744 --> 01:30:15,744
Hey?

1257
01:30:15,745 --> 01:30:16,745
Hey?

1258
01:30:18,133 --> 01:30:19,224
I know why you came.

1259
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:21,420
It's to drop off your clothes.

1260
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:24,770
- Come on.
- You wanna know, if it's true.

1261
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:30,827
Every bad thing,
you've heard about me.

1262
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:37,000
You want me to give you,
some kind of way out, so it doesn't...

1263
01:30:38,410 --> 01:30:39,950
hurt so much?

1264
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:48,131
There's no way out.

1265
01:30:51,231 --> 01:30:55,114
Every single thing,
you've heard and more...

1266
01:30:55,115 --> 01:30:56,115
It's all true.

1267
01:30:59,839 --> 01:31:00,660
It can never...

1268
01:31:03,103 --> 01:31:03,969
change.

1269
01:31:18,924 --> 01:31:20,290
But...uhhh

1270
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:21,900
I want you to know.

1271
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:26,780
I never, I never...

1272
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:31,111
Hurt any good people.

1273
01:31:35,648 --> 01:31:36,756
What about us?

1274
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:39,770
No. That..that's...

1275
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:41,650
that's not what i mean, Helen.

1276
01:31:43,370 --> 01:31:44,630
I don't understand,
what did you mean.

1277
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:49,000
Have I hurt you?

1278
01:31:51,010 --> 01:31:54,440
I didn't mean to.

1279
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,459
We gotta go okay?

1280
01:32:01,438 --> 01:32:03,194
Hey, come on.

1281
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:08,540
Hey, come here.

1282
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:12,545
Hey.

1283
01:32:14,435 --> 01:32:15,841
What're you doing?

1284
01:32:15,842 --> 01:32:16,842
I love you, monkey.

1285
01:32:16,843 --> 01:32:19,227
You know that, right?

1286
01:32:20,435 --> 01:32:22,970
I'm gonna get you a soda, okay?

1287
01:32:22,971 --> 01:32:23,971
No..I ...

1288
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,255
Will you come back?

1289
01:32:25,877 --> 01:32:27,517
Monkey. Come back
to the room...huh?

1290
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:52,570
<i>This is Officer David D.Brown,

who i knew to be a serial date rapist.</i>

1303
01:35:34,380 --> 01:35:36,725
<i>I was legally sane
at the time i commited the act.</i>

1304
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,625
<i>Over the years,
I've killed many men.</i>

1305
01:35:42,344 --> 01:35:43,522
<i>Bad guys,
all of them.</i>

1306
01:35:43,765 --> 01:35:45,942
<i>And if there are one or two exceptions..</i>

1307
01:35:45,943 --> 01:35:48,909
<i>I can only assume,
they ended on the wrong end of my gun,</i>

1308
01:35:49,205 --> 01:35:52,694
<i>To satisfy some..karmic breach.</i>

1309
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:56,240
<i>This statement is proferred lucidly,
i'm not in the state of duress.</i>

1310
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:58,600
Okay.

1311
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:05,553
I'll give you this tape,
if you cut me a deal.

1312
01:36:08,051 --> 01:36:09,796
- I don't want your tape.

1313
01:36:09,797 --> 01:36:10,797
What?

1314
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:14,244
- That's not the confession i want.

1315
01:36:16,223 --> 01:36:18,451
Is that the fucking Crystal Market case?

1316
01:36:18,452 --> 01:36:19,452
You're a fucking idiot!

1317
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:21,530
- Next time i see you?

1318
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,120
I'm putting cuffs on you.

1319
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:27,520
Are you out of your mind?

1320
01:36:28,270 --> 01:36:29,280
Timkins?

1321
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:32,264
Take what you got.
Which is a good case.

1322
01:36:32,265 --> 01:36:33,265
- It's the wrong confession!

1323
01:36:33,266 --> 01:36:35,472
Take the fucking tape.

1324
01:36:35,650 --> 01:36:37,610
You fucking idiot.

1325
01:36:41,252 --> 01:36:42,853
Take this fucking tape!

1326
01:36:46,454 --> 01:36:48,253
You're a fucking idiot, Timkins!

1327
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:53,725
Fucking idiot!

1328
01:37:39,410 --> 01:37:40,436
Really?

1329
01:37:43,166 --> 01:37:44,052
Where are you going?

1330
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:45,680
What?

1331
01:39:34,265 --> 01:39:37,756
