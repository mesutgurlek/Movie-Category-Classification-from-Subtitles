1
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:41,323
- Good morning, Warden.
- Tom.

2
00:03:57,927 --> 00:03:59,360
Is that Elwood Blues?

3
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:01,724
Yes, sir. Released yesterday.

4
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:04,800
Did you tell him about Jake?

5
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:07,283
No, sir. I thought you told him.

6
00:04:32,847 --> 00:04:34,121
I'm sorry.

7
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:06,522
Listen...

8
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:08,680
...I work for a friend of yours.

9
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:09,797
Who's that?

10
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:12,362
Your old drummer, Willie.

11
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:14,441
I dance at his club.

12
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:17,241
He heard you were out
and asked me to get you.

13
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,597
He said he'd give you a job.

14
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:24,602
Matara, could you drop me off here?

15
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:41,358
What can I do for you?

16
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:45,243
Sir, how much would that full-sized...

17
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:47,597
...Ford police package run me?

18
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:49,678
Get yourself $500...

19
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:52,159
...and come back to see me.

20
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:53,925
Okay, sir.

21
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,558
That's a nice car.

22
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,125
I'll save it for you.

23
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:02,800
Thanks.

24
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:14,676
I wasn't sure you would come, Elwood.

25
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:19,437
A letter from you is like a command, sister.
You know that.

26
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,566
Actually, it's Mother Mary now.

27
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:25,203
That's a promotion, isn't it?

28
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:28,724
I was sorry to hear about Jake.

29
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:33,837
Yeah, well I guess
he's in a much better place.

30
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,759
Where is Curtis?

31
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:44,884
Curtis has gone on as well, Elwood.
I'm sorry.

32
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:47,716
So that's why he stopped writing me.

33
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:53,244
He was very upset
when the orphanage closed.

34
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:57,283
Curtis was the closest thing to a dad
Jake and I ever had.

35
00:06:57,767 --> 00:06:59,519
He gave us the music.

36
00:06:59,647 --> 00:07:02,639
The Lord works in mysterious ways,
Elwood.

37
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:05,327
We must go on and fight the good fight.

38
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:08,444
The orphanage is gone, Jake's gone,
Curtis is gone.

39
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:11,963
I got no brother, no roots, no life.
I got nothing!

40
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:14,766
Young man...

41
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:18,557
...you were not taught and raised by me...

42
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,117
...to fold at the slightest whiff
of adverse circumstances.

43
00:07:23,247 --> 00:07:27,957
Now quit your silly moping,
pull yourself together and snap out of it!

44
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,241
But...

45
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:34,199
But nothing! Wise up!
Turn your heart to the Creator.

46
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:36,199
You are so quick to despair.

47
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:40,041
You are not the only person in the world
who has had tragedy in their lives.

48
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,595
Did you know that Curtis had a son?

49
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:47,161
Curtis had a son?

50
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:50,922
Before Curtis came to us
at St. Helen of the Blessed Shroud...

51
00:07:51,207 --> 00:07:55,519
...he had a musical group
that toured juke joints in the Midwest.

52
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:59,646
In one town, Curtis had an affair
with a married woman.

53
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:01,520
Go, Curtis.

54
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:05,126
I mean, that's terrible.

55
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:07,199
That's what I thought you meant.

56
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:11,599
The woman became pregnant
and decided to stay with her husband...

57
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:15,123
...never telling him
that the boy child wasn't his.

58
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:16,919
Curtis was devastated.

59
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:19,277
He came to us as a custodian...

60
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:23,838
...and spent the rest of his life
caring for little orphans like you.

61
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:36,037
That's a beautiful story.

62
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,166
Wait a minute. If Curtis had a son...

63
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:46,125
...that guy would be kind of like
my stepbrother.

64
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:48,480
I have a family.

65
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:51,485
Curtis stayed in touch
with the boy's mother.

66
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:53,842
He sent his paycheck every week.

67
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:55,918
Where is this boy now?

68
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:59,477
He's a grown man now,
and doing quite well.

69
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:01,956
He's in the city.
His name is Cabel Chamberlain.

70
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:04,397
Cabel Chamberlain.

71
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:07,524
He knows nothing about Curtis.
You are not to tell him.

72
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:09,320
I wouldn't say anything.

73
00:09:09,687 --> 00:09:11,882
Do you know anything about mentoring?

74
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,120
No. What about it?

75
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:17,437
I'd like you to meet someone.

76
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:21,681
Sister, would you send Buster in here?

77
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,326
Wait a minute.

78
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:24,522
Thank you.

79
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:33,636
Come in, Buster, and sit down.

80
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:41,924
Elwood, say hello to Buster.

81
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:43,721
Hi. How ya doin'?

82
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:45,997
Buster, say hello to Elwood.

83
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:47,595
Hi. How ya doin'?

84
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:51,398
The kid's a wiseass.

85
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:52,921
Shit!

86
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:55,922
What did you say?

87
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:58,999
I said, what a sweet kid.

88
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:02,679
That's more like it.
Now, here's my proposal.

89
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:04,883
Buster is a ward of the State.

90
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:08,084
Due to lack of space, the archdiocese...

91
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:11,079
...is housing homeless children
here at the hospital.

92
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:13,482
What's that got to do with me?

93
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:16,559
I thought you could come
and spend time with Buster.

94
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,726
Why don't you take Buster to the library?

95
00:10:22,127 --> 00:10:25,005
You know, I've been jacked around...

96
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:30,246
The library. No problem.

97
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,237
See you in two hours, boys.

98
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:40,366
Here's the deal. You wait here.
I'll come back for you with the car.

99
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:42,201
Do you have a car?

100
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:44,279
I'm working on it.

101
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:58,084
Chicago. Cabel Chamberlain.

102
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,679
Thanks for the ride.

103
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:24,005
Kid, are you stalking me?

104
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:32,917
What are you, fifteen? Seventeen?

105
00:11:33,647 --> 00:11:34,682
I'm ten.

106
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:36,481
Ten?

107
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:40,640
I know what that's like.

108
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,276
You're Ionely, searching for a place in life.

109
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:44,965
Don't blow it like I did.

110
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:50,121
Stay away from drugs, gangs, cyber porn
and you could be President some day.

111
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,359
But I don't want to be President.

112
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:59,362
I'm busy. I got kind of a brother in there.
He must be in trouble.

113
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:03,566
Besides, you don't want to hang around
with some over-forty recidivist.

114
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:05,600
Now scram.

115
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:11,964
A Mr. Elwood J. Blues is here to see you.

116
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,441
Yes, sir.

117
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:19,600
Commander Chamberlain's office
is on the 12th floor. He's expecting you.

118
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:23,405
"Commander" Chamberlain?

119
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:25,997
How can I help you, Mr...

120
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:28,597
Blues. Elwood J. Blues.

121
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:35,444
Could you take off your hat
and glasses in my office?

122
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:47,196
Okay, you can put your glasses back on.

123
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:52,242
What exactly is the nature
of your visit here, Mr. Blues?

124
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:53,885
Well, it's like this.

125
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:57,721
I used to be in a band called
The Blues Brothers.

126
00:12:58,607 --> 00:12:59,517
So?

127
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:02,804
With a partner whose name was
Jake Blues.

128
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:04,556
Go on.

129
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,562
And you are our long-Iost brother.

130
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,046
Mr. Blues...

131
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,605
...I am an only child.

132
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:22,045
But your real father
was like a real father to me, too.

133
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:24,636
- My real father?
- Yeah, Curtis.

134
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:27,716
Have you noticed
that I am African-American?

135
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:30,157
That's okay. So was Curtis.

136
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,957
See, your mother and Curtis had an affair...

137
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:39,277
...which produced a little boy. That's you.

138
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:41,801
My father...

139
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:44,205
...passed away 14 years ago.

140
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:49,479
He was a full-bird colonel
in the U.S. Air Force.

141
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:50,556
My mother...

142
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:53,436
...now lives in Phoenix, Arizona
and a more...

143
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:58,277
...honorable, sweet-tempered
and goodly woman does not exist.

144
00:13:58,407 --> 00:14:00,841
I'm not making any moral judgments.

145
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:03,361
But one can project
what might have happened.

146
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:05,359
Your mom, young...

147
00:14:05,807 --> 00:14:08,719
...her husband in the military.
Often away from home...

148
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:12,240
...which may have pushed her
to reach out...

149
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:14,518
...stray from the nest.
- That's enough.

150
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:17,926
Just a minute...

151
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:20,441
...please.

152
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:27,442
Hi, Ma. It's me, Cab.

153
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:29,799
Listen, I have a...

154
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:34,439
...gentleman here who's telling me
some story about a man named Curtis.

155
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,156
What?

156
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:43,282
Right.

157
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:51,636
So, what precisely do you want from me?

158
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:54,640
Seeing as we're kind of stepbrothers...

159
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,718
...I thought you could help me out.

160
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:58,077
How?

161
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:00,078
I need $500 for this car.

162
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:04,122
I thought maybe you could loan me
the money. Or...

163
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:05,640
Or what?

164
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:08,157
I want to put the band back together.

165
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:09,805
You could join us.

166
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:13,161
I am a commander...

167
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,083
...in the Illinois State Police.

168
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:17,919
I enjoy my job.

169
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:20,647
You waltz in here...

170
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,598
...telling me that I have a dead...

171
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:26,682
...white criminal brother,
who was in a band, which...

172
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:30,157
...the last time they played anywhere
were charged with...

173
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,678
...grand larceny...

174
00:15:33,047 --> 00:15:37,484
...reckless endangerment,
felonious motor vehicle assault...

175
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:41,879
...over 700 violations
of the Highway Traffic Act...

176
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:45,004
...and damages, both public and private...

177
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:48,318
...in excess of $24 million.

178
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:52,161
And you are asking me
if I want to join this band?

179
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:54,203
I could show you all the moves.

180
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,563
Get the hell out of my office, right now!

181
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:00,359
I think you need a hug.

182
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:04,162
And don't ever come back here again!

183
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:15,043
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

184
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:21,678
He dropped this.

185
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:35,004
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

186
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:38,081
Four...

187
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:40,198
...five hundred dollars.

188
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:43,645
Thank you, sir.

189
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:45,800
This your boy?

190
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:48,761
He's...

191
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:52,441
I'm his associate.

192
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:54,918
Yeah, that's who he is.

193
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:58,283
Lucky you came today.
I'm selling the place tomorrow.

194
00:16:58,807 --> 00:16:59,683
Why?

195
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:03,476
I'm going to New Orleans
to try out a new career.

196
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:05,846
Good luck, Mr. Gasperon.

197
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:08,998
Good luck to you, Mr. Blues.

198
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,126
Mother Mary, we've done two bed checks...

199
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,085
...searched the grounds
and we can't find him.

200
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:21,076
Who?

201
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,637
Buster. He's missing.

202
00:17:24,687 --> 00:17:25,961
Elwood!

203
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:32,319
Have you seen my wallet?

204
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:06,319
It smells like dog shit in here.

205
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:08,399
Don't say "shit," kid.

206
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:22,398
You don't need that shit, kid.

207
00:19:21,847 --> 00:19:23,121
Elwood.

208
00:19:29,247 --> 00:19:30,236
It's me.

209
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:32,999
Matara.

210
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:35,202
Yeah, right.

211
00:19:35,647 --> 00:19:36,602
Mack.

212
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:39,682
Look who's here. Elwood Blues.

213
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:42,202
From Willie's old band.

214
00:19:44,887 --> 00:19:46,036
Is this your son?

215
00:19:46,527 --> 00:19:49,087
Well, he's...

216
00:19:49,487 --> 00:19:50,636
I'm hungry.

217
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:55,245
Come on, let's get you something to eat.
Willie's in the office.

218
00:19:57,407 --> 00:20:00,558
What would you say
to my putting the band back together?

219
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:05,159
I'd say I've got a good business here
and I'm not going back to jail.

220
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:07,637
You're saying you don't miss it?

221
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09,520
That's right.

222
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:12,036
You know you miss the music.

223
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:16,566
No pharmaceutical could equal the rush
you get when the band grooves.

224
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:20,123
People are dancing and shouting.
The house is rocking.

225
00:20:23,127 --> 00:20:24,082
Sir?

226
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:26,206
Yes, Elizondo?

227
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:28,840
Found your wallet.

228
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:32,206
Let's see...

229
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:35,797
...badge, license, credit cards.

230
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:37,998
Just the cash is missing. Where was it?

231
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:40,840
Turned in to lost-and-found
in a paper bag...

232
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:43,282
...with this note.

233
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:55,600
I want a felony theft warrant
put out on Elwood Blues.

234
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:57,445
I want this guy. Now.

235
00:20:57,527 --> 00:21:00,564
What did he mean,
calling you his "little brother"?

236
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:04,556
Right away, sir.

237
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:06,880
<i>Good evening, welcome to Willie's</i>.

What was that?

263
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:54,324
Strong-arm shit.
Protection payment. You know.

264
00:22:54,647 --> 00:22:58,481
This time it's Russians.
But if I pay them, they leave me alone.

265
00:22:58,727 --> 00:22:59,796
That's not right.

266
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:02,000
No shit.

267
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:13,721
If I could only figure out
what Elwood's game is.

268
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:16,237
Why did he come to see you?

269
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:19,724
To borrow $500
and ask me to join his band.

270
00:23:20,407 --> 00:23:22,238
Well, he got his $500.

271
00:23:22,887 --> 00:23:24,923
What instrument do you play?

272
00:23:26,407 --> 00:23:30,719
<i>How about a big hand for our gorgeous,</i>
<i>professional lady dancers?</i>

273
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:37,116
Where's Willie?

274
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:40,199
Visiting his ailing stepfather. Why?

275
00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:42,716
The Russians are here to see him.

276
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,679
I'll handle it. Where's Buster?

277
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:49,685
In the office, sleeping.

278
00:23:53,087 --> 00:23:54,440
Good evening, gentlemen.

279
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:57,917
Mr. Hall has been unavoidably detained.
He may be a trifle late.

280
00:23:58,007 --> 00:23:59,725
May I buy you a drink?

281
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:30,322
Mack.

282
00:24:31,287 --> 00:24:32,242
Got a minute?

283
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:23,237
Don't forget our deal now, Elwood.

284
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:46,044
You can stop worrying.
Those Russians won't be back.

285
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:51,281
Those guys are bad mothers, Elwood.
Serious shit. They kill people.

286
00:25:52,407 --> 00:25:53,840
They kill people?

287
00:25:54,527 --> 00:25:55,926
Try to understand.

288
00:25:56,047 --> 00:25:59,960
Those goons are orphan remnants of
the post-perestroika Soviet secret police...

289
00:26:00,047 --> 00:26:05,167
...who twisted the well-intentioned,
original Marxist-Leninist doctrine...

290
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:08,922
...using state security, which was
corrupted by Beria in the '30s.

291
00:26:09,007 --> 00:26:11,726
Once a mass populace
is coerced into such behavior...

292
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:16,801
...a radical shift, like glasnost,
produces guys like...

293
00:26:16,887 --> 00:26:21,005
...headless automata who continue
the brutish measures...

294
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:25,285
...to which their genes were programmed
since the fall of the Romanovs.

295
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:28,564
That's great. I feel much better.

296
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:18,757
"Stay away from Willie's.

What are you doing?

302
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:57,443

Everyone please leave now!

327
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:30,556
- Where's Buster?
- I don't know.

328
00:30:42,927 --> 00:30:43,962
Gas!

329
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:15,486
Come on! Hurry!

330
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:25,116
Elwood!

331
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:26,996
You okay?

332
00:31:27,087 --> 00:31:28,440
The girls get out?

333
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:30,485
Yeah, everyone's fine.

334
00:31:33,207 --> 00:31:35,198
Matara, thanks for everything.

335
00:31:35,487 --> 00:31:36,966
Time to go.

336
00:32:00,247 --> 00:32:02,158
They have automatic weapons.

337
00:32:02,327 --> 00:32:04,158
Look in the glove compartment.

338
00:32:05,567 --> 00:32:09,276
Carpet tacks.
They have guns and we have carpet tacks.

339
00:32:09,407 --> 00:32:12,080
They're not carpet tacks.
They're dry-wall nails.

340
00:32:15,327 --> 00:32:17,966
Roll down the window. Dump the nails.

341
00:33:03,847 --> 00:33:06,566
The Lord works in mysterious ways, Mack.

342
00:33:06,887 --> 00:33:08,320
What do you mean?

343
00:33:08,407 --> 00:33:12,161
If not for those Russian gangsters
and you helping me...

344
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:15,166
...I wouldn't have seen you sing.
You're good.

345
00:33:15,247 --> 00:33:16,396
Thank you, Elwood.

346
00:33:16,807 --> 00:33:20,641
Since the Russians torched Willie's club,
he'll need a job.

347
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:23,356
You'll need a job. I'll need a job.

348
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:27,518
So, you'll join the band,
then we'll all have jobs.

349
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:30,279
- Follow me?
- Sure.

350
00:33:35,127 --> 00:33:36,480
What band?

351
00:33:53,887 --> 00:33:55,286
Lieutenant.

352
00:34:00,487 --> 00:34:02,318
- Elizondo.
- Find anything?

353
00:34:02,527 --> 00:34:04,597
No bodies, but lots of gunfire.

354
00:34:04,687 --> 00:34:06,006
Find the club owner?

355
00:34:06,207 --> 00:34:07,640
Not yet.

356
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:09,002
Wait.

357
00:34:09,927 --> 00:34:11,599
You better see this.

358
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:25,083
Matt.

359
00:34:25,727 --> 00:34:27,524
You finally sell that demonstrator?

360
00:34:27,807 --> 00:34:31,004
Check this funky car coming in.
I got a weird vibe.

361
00:34:47,047 --> 00:34:50,005
The suit's real neat,
but do I have to wear the hat?

362
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:55,397
These are unsophisticated men. They only
respond to fear and the draw of lucre.

363
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,036
We elicit this by using
iconographic symbols...

364
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:00,038
...and psychological intimidation.

365
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:01,765
The way we look together...

366
00:35:01,847 --> 00:35:04,680
...presents a uniform image
of strength and organization.

367
00:35:05,487 --> 00:35:08,957
Don't say anything.
Look mean. No smiling.

368
00:35:14,007 --> 00:35:15,281
Good to see you.

369
00:35:15,807 --> 00:35:17,923
Even though that last gig was a nightmare.

370
00:35:18,807 --> 00:35:22,243
Boys, meet my new partner in the act,
Mighty Mack.

371
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:25,319
Mack, "Blue Lou" Marini,
Matt "Guitar" Murphy.

372
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:27,681
Mighty Mack.

373
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:29,280
So, what's this about?

374
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:31,719
Putting the band back together.

375
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:33,963
You can't mention that here.

376
00:35:34,447 --> 00:35:36,165
She's back from lunch.

377
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:44,836
Elwood.

378
00:35:45,367 --> 00:35:46,322
Ma'am.

379
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:48,525
Sorry to hear about Jake.

380
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:50,321
Thank you, ma'am.

381
00:35:50,687 --> 00:35:51,722
Who's this?

382
00:35:52,607 --> 00:35:54,837
My new partner, Mack McTeer.

383
00:35:55,127 --> 00:35:56,162
Pleased to meet you.

384
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:00,756
Matt, can I speak to you privately?

385
00:36:00,927 --> 00:36:02,042
Sure, baby.

386
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:08,762
When you got out of prison,
you said, "No more Blues Brothers."

387
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,400
Yes, I did.

388
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:15,607
We've built up a good business using
the cash from the sale of the coffee shop...

389
00:36:15,727 --> 00:36:19,515
...to start this Mercedes dealership.
What's wrong with you?

390
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:24,280
And I keep your pathetic friend on...

391
00:36:24,447 --> 00:36:27,519
...even though he hasn't sold a car
in over two years.

392
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:30,042
Yes, you have, and no, he hasn't.

393
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:31,879
You talk straight with me.

394
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:33,161
I always do.

395
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:35,841
And treat me with respect at all times.

396
00:36:36,047 --> 00:36:37,002
I do, baby.

397
00:36:37,287 --> 00:36:40,245
You know what I mean when I say respect?

398
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:52,758
"What you want, baby I got it

399

and Mr. Pickett, I haven't looked back.

483
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:37,999
These guys are amazing.

484
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:49,079
What do you want, Elwood?

485
00:42:49,807 --> 00:42:51,763
I'm putting the band back together.

486
00:42:52,127 --> 00:42:54,436
We need Murph on the keyboards.

487
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:55,762
I see.

488
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:58,077
I won't go without your say-so.

489
00:43:00,127 --> 00:43:04,439
Murph says you're in publishing,
telephone sales and matrimonial services?

490
00:43:04,647 --> 00:43:05,762
Yes, we are.

491
00:43:06,407 --> 00:43:09,126
Just what is it that you do exactly?

492
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:12,197
I'm 18 years old. I'm blonde.

493
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:16,799
I'm 36-24-36, and my name is Bambi.

Charlie, take it easy. That's all in the past.

00:46:36,687 --> 00:46:40,362
He hung up on me.
A lot of burnt bridges, Mr. Blues.

531
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:44,920
I know you can book us somewhere.
You're still the best.

532
00:46:46,407 --> 00:46:47,999
Ever hear of Queen Moussette?

533
00:46:48,087 --> 00:46:50,681
The Louisiana witch, Queen Moussette?

534
00:46:50,887 --> 00:46:55,403
That's her. She has a "Battle of the Bands"
going on at her club.

535
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:59,639
Big cash prize. Your band wins,
I get 15 percent of the take.

536
00:47:01,807 --> 00:47:04,640
I'll book you a couple of gigs
on the way to Louisiana.

537
00:47:05,007 --> 00:47:06,759
Golly, thanks, Mr. Sline.

538
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:08,681
Let go of me.

539
00:47:08,847 --> 00:47:09,962
Sorry.

540
00:47:12,327 --> 00:47:15,364
One more thing. You'll have to audition
for Queen Moussette.

541
00:47:15,447 --> 00:47:17,199
Don't tell the boys about this.

542
00:47:18,607 --> 00:47:21,246
We'll call to find out where our first gig is.

543
00:47:21,367 --> 00:47:23,119
Just be careful, Elwood.

544
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:28,360
Alan Rubin.

545
00:47:28,687 --> 00:47:31,599
Mr. Fabulous.

546
00:47:31,847 --> 00:47:33,280
Mr. Fabulous.

547
00:47:37,207 --> 00:47:39,437
The Blues Brothers Band.

548
00:47:50,047 --> 00:47:53,323
You're going to love them.
They're absolutely sensational.

549
00:47:53,527 --> 00:47:56,405
Really sensational.
They're a great blues band.

550
00:47:56,847 --> 00:48:00,840
Yeah, blues band.
No, blues, not bluegrass.

551
00:48:01,807 --> 00:48:03,638
You don't want a blues band?

552
00:48:03,767 --> 00:48:04,802
Bluegrass.

553
00:48:07,127 --> 00:48:10,199
They're the Bluegrass Brothers.
They're wonderful.

554
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:13,006
They absolutely pulverize an audience.

555
00:48:13,327 --> 00:48:17,161
You're going to call and thank me.
The Bluegrass Brothers.

556
00:48:29,767 --> 00:48:32,645
Our first date is at the county fair...

557
00:48:32,927 --> 00:48:35,157
...in Cynthiana, Kentucky...

558
00:48:35,527 --> 00:48:39,600
...and then we have this mystery gig
in Louisiana.

559
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,001
Mystery gig?

560
00:48:43,327 --> 00:48:45,602
Elwood, you got the keys to the trunk?

561
00:48:53,687 --> 00:48:54,756
It's full.

562
00:48:54,967 --> 00:48:57,527
I haven't played a county fair since '68.

563
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,877
Sounds like a lot of laughs.

564
00:49:01,727 --> 00:49:03,524
We're back on the road again.

565
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,359
Who are you, Willie Nelson?

566
00:49:06,447 --> 00:49:07,482
I'll ride with Elwood.

567
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:09,637
Go right ahead, Mr. Thrill-Seeker.

568
00:49:10,607 --> 00:49:11,926
Excuse me, sir.

569
00:49:14,567 --> 00:49:16,637
Didn't you used to be Elwood Blues?

570
00:49:17,167 --> 00:49:18,122
Who's asking?

571
00:49:18,207 --> 00:49:20,482
I've listened to your stuff since I was a kid.

572
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:22,000
Yeah, so?

573
00:49:22,127 --> 00:49:25,915
My friends and I have a band.
We're rehearsing nearby.

574
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:30,683
It would be so cool, and mean so much
to me, if you'd come listen to us play.

575
00:49:31,367 --> 00:49:34,803
Sure. Go get started
and I'll be there in a minute.

576
00:49:35,367 --> 00:49:36,720
Great.

577
00:49:42,487 --> 00:49:45,206
Let's highball!

578
00:51:25,127 --> 00:51:26,560
Mr. Blues?

579
00:51:27,407 --> 00:51:31,764
- It's been almost seven days, Mother Mary.
- We must call the police.

580
00:51:31,927 --> 00:51:34,964
Kidnapping is a federal offence.

581
00:51:36,447 --> 00:51:38,085
I suppose you're right.

582
00:51:38,407 --> 00:51:40,284
We should call the police.

583
00:51:49,527 --> 00:51:50,357
Sir.

584
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:55,799
We just received a call.
Elwood Blues has kidnapped a child.

585
00:52:26,967 --> 00:52:28,036
Roachdale 31.

586
00:53:05,127 --> 00:53:08,244
- Wait.
- I got a cheeseburger cooling, man.

587
00:53:08,567 --> 00:53:12,162
Buster, I'm sorry,
you'll have to see a bad side of me.

588
00:53:12,247 --> 00:53:14,317
Mack, your shaving cream.

589
00:53:14,607 --> 00:53:16,837
So none of you are driving that Ford?

590
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:18,555
No.

591
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,756
And whose dry white toast is that?

592
00:53:31,447 --> 00:53:33,597
Run for your lives!

593
00:53:36,407 --> 00:53:39,638
My God, help us! Somebody help us!

594
00:53:39,767 --> 00:53:43,726
He's having an attack!
It's puffball bacteria!

595
00:53:44,047 --> 00:53:45,765
It's extremely contagious!

596
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,439
What in Sam Hill?

597
00:53:47,607 --> 00:53:50,167
Run away! Oh, God!

598
00:53:54,007 --> 00:53:56,885
It's puffball bacteria! It's contagious!

599
00:53:57,207 --> 00:53:58,640
Save yourselves!

600
00:54:05,607 --> 00:54:07,359
Save yourselves!

601
00:54:08,687 --> 00:54:11,247
Save yourselves! Save yourselves!

602
00:54:41,207 --> 00:54:43,926
Hot damn. That's quite a trick.

603
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:48,997
That white trash ex-con
invented criminally evasive driving.

604
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:51,079
He kidnapped a little...

605
00:54:54,047 --> 00:54:55,526
Get after him!

606
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:33,477
<i>Murph?</i>

607
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,922
Go ahead.

608
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:36,959
See you at the gig.

609
00:55:38,047 --> 00:55:40,117
Where is the gig?

610
00:55:40,567 --> 00:55:45,163
County fairgrounds, off Route 107,
Cynthiana, Kentucky, 11 PM tomorrow.

611
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:46,996
See you there.

612
00:55:49,327 --> 00:55:53,002
How will he get there
with all the cops after him?

613
00:55:54,647 --> 00:55:55,921
Wait a minute.

614
00:55:57,607 --> 00:56:00,485
Don't I know you boys from somewhere?

615
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:05,321
Check, please.

616
00:56:20,167 --> 00:56:23,284
We have to get off this road.
They've called ahead by now.

617
00:56:24,367 --> 00:56:28,565
Two miles down, get off this
and on County Road 245 to Mariah Hill.

618
00:56:28,647 --> 00:56:30,956
That'll get us close to the State line.

619
00:56:31,447 --> 00:56:33,005
We have to lose them first.

620
00:56:38,167 --> 00:56:39,600
You passed the turn.

621
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:40,642
I know.

622
00:56:48,247 --> 00:56:50,397
You're hoping they lost interest?

623
00:57:38,847 --> 00:57:41,315
This is Agent Peters
and Agent Bowman, FBI.

624
00:57:41,447 --> 00:57:42,800
Good to have you here.

625
00:57:43,287 --> 00:57:45,801
Elwood Blues is a menace
to decent people.

626
00:57:45,887 --> 00:57:48,355
We'll get him, sir. That's a promise.

627
00:57:49,207 --> 00:57:51,801
Every lawman in two states
is on this border.

628
00:57:51,887 --> 00:57:54,447
Let him try to get past this roadblock.

629
00:58:01,007 --> 00:58:02,520
Roll up your windows.

630
00:58:37,527 --> 00:58:39,483
How long can we stay down here?

631
00:58:39,847 --> 00:58:41,917
How long can you hold your breath?

632
00:59:10,687 --> 00:59:11,563
Am I right?

633
00:59:11,647 --> 00:59:12,921
Yes, sir.

634
00:59:14,007 --> 00:59:15,326
I said, am I right?

635
00:59:15,407 --> 00:59:16,396
Yes, sir.

636
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:18,398
I can't hear you!

637
00:59:18,727 --> 00:59:19,842
Yes, sir!

638
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:24,083
You may think we're just a group
of sorry son-bitches...

639
00:59:24,167 --> 00:59:26,397
...out here jerking each other off.

640
00:59:28,247 --> 00:59:31,523
Or you may just think
that we know something.

641
00:59:33,167 --> 00:59:35,044
I'll tell you something else.

642
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:39,082
The federal government has a computer.

643
00:59:40,567 --> 00:59:43,286
This computer is wired...

644
00:59:43,607 --> 00:59:46,804
...to a computer in Jerusalem...

645
00:59:48,087 --> 00:59:49,998
...and Moscow.

646
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:52,798
There's something in the river.

647
00:59:53,087 --> 00:59:53,917
Where?

648
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:56,476
I saw something under the water, sir.

649
00:59:57,847 --> 00:59:58,962
Son...

650
01:00:00,687 --> 01:00:02,962
...it's okay to be nervous.

651
01:00:04,327 --> 01:00:06,841
There are enough explosives in that boat...

652
01:00:07,047 --> 01:00:09,686
...to blow up every post office
in the country.

653
01:00:10,087 --> 01:00:14,000
But nobody knows we're here.
Nobody knows our plans.

654
01:00:34,207 --> 01:00:35,879
You guys having a picnic?

655
01:00:38,087 --> 01:00:40,317
Don't shoot! You might hit the boat!

656
01:00:42,007 --> 01:00:43,201
What boat?

657
01:00:43,407 --> 01:00:48,527
That's the international Jewish,
communist conspiracy in action, people.

658
01:00:48,887 --> 01:00:51,845
One of their spy satellites
picked up our location.

659
01:00:53,927 --> 01:00:54,996
Kill them!

660
01:01:13,847 --> 01:01:15,803
- Did you hear something?
- Nope.

661
01:01:22,647 --> 01:01:25,878
- You sure they'll come?
- They're booked here. They'll come.

662
01:01:33,407 --> 01:01:35,523

a lot more bluegrass.

665
01:02:02,847 --> 01:02:05,202
I'll fake some fiddle on my keyboard.

666
01:02:08,087 --> 01:02:10,681
We go on after the last car stunt.

667
01:02:11,607 --> 01:02:14,485
How will Elwood, Mack and the kid...

668
01:02:14,807 --> 01:02:17,844
...get to the stage
with all the police around?

669
01:02:22,647 --> 01:02:24,205
<i>I like the car this color</i>.

670
01:02:24,287 --> 01:02:27,802

671
01:02:40,927 --> 01:02:42,326
All right. Go on.

672
01:02:47,407 --> 01:02:51,480
Lots of heat here.
Maybe we ought to skip this gig.

673
01:02:54,487 --> 01:02:58,196
That would be unprofessional.
Park it somewhere dark.

01:04:23,607 --> 01:04:24,881
You look like ZZ Top.

681
01:04:24,967 --> 01:04:27,925

Sline says their next job is at a place called
Queen Moussette's.

719
01:09:12,327 --> 01:09:14,397
Queen Moussette's.

720
01:09:26,087 --> 01:09:28,647
That's it. She's bone dry.

721
01:09:28,847 --> 01:09:30,599
I'd like to be. Let me out.

722
01:09:41,967 --> 01:09:42,956
Where are we?

723
01:09:43,287 --> 01:09:46,006
Five miles north of Panther Burn,
Mississippi.

724
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,482
What's the plan?

725
01:09:48,847 --> 01:09:50,360
We start walking.

726
01:09:50,887 --> 01:09:53,276
What's the point? I say we turn around.

727
01:09:55,487 --> 01:09:58,843
Elwood. I think we got a rebellion
on our hands.

728
01:09:59,047 --> 01:10:00,560
What do you mean?

729
01:10:06,607 --> 01:10:09,201
Why don't you give them
a motivational speech?

730
01:10:10,367 --> 01:10:12,756
So, you all want to quit?

731
01:10:15,527 --> 01:10:17,199
Honestly, who can blame you?

732
01:10:17,287 --> 01:10:20,484
I've dragged you down
as far as living humans can go.

733
01:10:21,567 --> 01:10:23,478
All right. Fine.

734
01:10:24,007 --> 01:10:26,157
'Bye. I understand.

735
01:10:30,247 --> 01:10:32,807
So, what happens now?

736
01:10:34,207 --> 01:10:36,437
I don't know. I guess it's over.

737
01:10:49,487 --> 01:10:50,715
Go away, kid.

738
01:10:51,807 --> 01:10:54,196
You're not being a very good mentor.

739
01:10:55,247 --> 01:10:58,159
I ain't your mentor.
I don't even know what it means.

740
01:10:58,247 --> 01:11:00,966
Just do me a favor and go away.

741
01:11:02,807 --> 01:11:06,436
You're not the Elwood Blues I know.
The Elwood I know once said:

742
01:11:06,527 --> 01:11:09,917
"No pharmaceutical drug
could equal the rush you get...

743
01:11:10,047 --> 01:11:13,881
"...when the band grooves,
people are dancing, shouting...

744
01:11:14,007 --> 01:11:15,725
"...and the house is rocking."

745
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:18,926
Yeah, that was me.

746
01:11:19,007 --> 01:11:21,567
The music. You know you miss the music.

747
01:11:23,887 --> 01:11:24,922
Thanks, Buster.

748
01:11:36,567 --> 01:11:37,636
Go if you wish.

749
01:11:38,247 --> 01:11:39,521
Remember this.

750
01:11:39,727 --> 01:11:43,879
Walk away now and you walk away
from your skills, your vocations...

751
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:48,479
...leaving our youth with nothing
but digitally-sampled techno grooves...

752
01:11:48,727 --> 01:11:52,720
...quasi-synth rhythms, pseudo songs
of violence-laden gangster rap...

753
01:11:52,887 --> 01:11:56,357
...acid pop and saccharine, soulless slush.

754
01:11:57,527 --> 01:12:01,600
Depart now and you separate yourselves
from the vital legacies of...

755
01:12:01,687 --> 01:12:04,247
...Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters,
Willie Dixon...

756
01:12:04,327 --> 01:12:06,795
...Jimmy Reed, Memphis Slim,
Blind Boy Fuller...

757
01:12:06,887 --> 01:12:10,846
...Louis Jordan, Little Walter, Big Walter,
Sonny Boy Williamson One and Two...

758
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:15,079
...Otis Redding, Jackie Wilson, Elvis Presley
and Robert K. Weiss.

759
01:12:16,247 --> 01:12:18,636
Who is Robert K. Weiss?

760
01:12:20,087 --> 01:12:24,877
Turn your backs and you snuff out
the fragile candles of blues, R&B and soul.

761
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:29,080
When those flames expire,
the light of the world is extinguished...

762
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:32,364
...because the music which has moved
mankind for seven decades...

763
01:12:32,447 --> 01:12:36,235
...will wither and die
from abandonment and neglect.

764
01:12:50,127 --> 01:12:51,082
Shit.

765
01:13:01,767 --> 01:13:04,042
Go ahead, cats. I'll get gas.

766
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:10,359
Hey, look. A circus.

767
01:13:11,607 --> 01:13:13,404
It's a tent-revival meeting.

768
01:13:19,487 --> 01:13:22,684
Excuse me. Who's preaching
the good word today, ma'am?

769
01:13:22,887 --> 01:13:25,924
The Right Reverend Cleophus James
from Chicago.

770
01:13:26,127 --> 01:13:28,641
Of the Triple Rock Baptist Church?

771
01:13:28,727 --> 01:13:30,479
From Chicago. That's right.

772
01:13:32,727 --> 01:13:36,322
I know him. He'll give us gas money.
We'll meet you guys inside.

773
01:13:45,767 --> 01:13:48,964
Okay, thanks. Keep an eye on them.
Wait for us to arrive.

774
01:13:50,727 --> 01:13:54,879
That was the Sheriff in Panther Burn.

rap, Motown, operetta...

we've even been called upon to do a polka.

- You can't stay with Elwood.

1115
01:49:47,167 --> 01:49:48,805
They think he kidnapped you.

1116
01:49:48,887 --> 01:49:50,115
But they're wrong.

1117
01:49:50,207 --> 01:49:52,118
They won't believe that.

1118
01:49:52,367 --> 01:49:53,800
He's right, Buster.

1119
01:49:55,087 --> 01:49:59,603
If I go back with them,
they'll put me in a home with people...

1120
01:49:59,687 --> 01:50:02,201
...who don't love me,
and put you back in jail.

1121
01:50:02,287 --> 01:50:03,959
I'll never see you again.

1122
01:50:04,127 --> 01:50:06,038
And we'll both be sad forever.

1123
01:50:06,767 --> 01:50:08,678
So, what do we do?

1124
01:50:11,807 --> 01:50:13,718
We're all brothers now, right?

1125
01:50:14,927 --> 01:50:18,442
You guys stay here and distract them.
I'll kidnap Elwood.

1126
01:50:21,247 --> 01:50:22,316
Good luck.

1127
01:50:23,447 --> 01:50:24,846
See you down the road.

1128
01:50:24,927 --> 01:50:26,599
Further on up the road.

1129
01:50:52,767 --> 01:50:54,359
Stop that mound of moss!

1130
01:51:23,887 --> 01:51:26,765
The Lord does work in mysterious ways,
Elwood.

1131
01:51:32,887 --> 01:51:34,240
Put on your seat belt.
