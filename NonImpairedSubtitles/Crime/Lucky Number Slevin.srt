1
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,152
He's clean.

2
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:36,151
So...

3
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:38,756
Why are you here? Hm?

4
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,493
<i>There was a time.</i>

5
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,456
4:35.

6
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:45,538
You misunderstood.

7
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:49,458
I wasn't asking for the time,
I was just saying, "There was a time."

8
00:04:51,544 --> 00:04:53,297
There was a time?

9
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:54,943
Mm-hm.

10
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:57,300
Take brown sugar back there, for example.

11
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:00,416
<i>She's pretty fucking foxy, right?</i>

12
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,265
She's 70.

13
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,303
If she's a day.

14
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:06,867
But there was a time.

15
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,304
- I don't follow.
- The name's Smith. I'm from out of town.

16
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:13,344
- Listen, Mr. Smith...
- Just Smith.

17
00:05:14,868 --> 00:05:17,746
The reason I'm in town,
in case you're wondering...

18
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,585
...is because of a Kansas City Shuffle.

19
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,182
What's a Kansas City Shuffle?

20
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,661
Kansas City Shuffle is
when everybody looks right and you go left.

21
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,706
- Never heard of it.
- Hm.

22
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,862
It's not something people hear about.

23
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:36,624
Falls on deaf ears mostly.

24
00:05:37,352 --> 00:05:40,585
But this particular one's
been over 20 years in the making.

25
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,105
<i>20 years, huh?</i>

26
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:44,148
No small matter.

27
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,870
Requires a lot of planning.

28
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:51,951
It involves a lot of people.

29
00:05:52,795 --> 00:05:55,628
People connected only
by the slightest of events.

30
00:05:56,675 --> 00:05:58,632
Like whispers in the night...

31
00:05:59,356 --> 00:06:03,350
...in that place that never forgets
even when those people do.

32
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,835
It all starts with a horse.

33
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,956
<i>It's what they called back then
a drugstore handicap.</i>

34
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:23,958
<i>A guy wants what the fella calls a sure thing.
So he schemes to make it so.</i>

35
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,829
<i>He calls in the doc, a nobler from Antwerp
known for his savvy but not for his discretion.</i>

36
00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:34,312
<i>Oh. Fuck me, baby. Fuck me, baby.</i>

37
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:37,474
<i>The same could be said
for Doc's jelly on the side - Gloria.</i>

38
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:40,032
- Almost there, almost there.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

39
00:06:40,124 --> 00:06:42,479
Hey, which horse did you say
it was again, baby?

40
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:55,404
<i>Which brings us to Abe. Because Gloria
was too much jelly for one outfit.</i>

41
00:06:56,445 --> 00:06:58,402
Hey, baby, is your wife around?

42
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:00,637
<i>- What do you want?
Who is it, Abe?</i>

43
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,323
<i>Ah... it's Seymour.</i>

44
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:07,480
<i>Sure. Tell that bitch to open her eyes.
Maybe then she'd see more.</i>

45
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,523
Seymour says hello.

46
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:12,076
What are you doing calling me here?

47
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:15,605
Christmas came early this year, baby.
I got a present for you.

48
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:17,282
Remember my friend Doc?

49
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,840
<i>Now Abe wasn't a nosy fella,
but he had a nose.</i>

50
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,847
<i>And right below his nose was his mouth.</i>

51
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:26,839
<i>Do you remember Gloria the hooker?</i>

52
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:31,607
Well, Gloria's got this friend Doc
who's got a line on a doped-up racehorse.

53
00:07:31,691 --> 00:07:33,647
<i>The fix is in at Aqueduct.</i>

54
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:35,961
- Seventh horse. Tenth race.
- Doped up?

55
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:38,726
<i>And then there was this joker who had ears...</i>

56
00:07:39,453 --> 00:07:41,091
<i>Let's get back.</i>

57
00:07:41,173 --> 00:07:43,404
<i>... who looked like somebody's uncle.</i>

58
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:45,451
Max, who's your favorite uncle?

59
00:07:45,535 --> 00:07:47,685
OK, who's your second favorite uncle?

60
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:49,527
Just pay attention.

61
00:07:49,615 --> 00:07:51,368
I got something here.

62
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:55,085
<i>And before you know it,
folks are getting a big dose of the gimmies.</i>

63
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:57,610
<i>And men start talking their hats off.</i>

64
00:07:57,696 --> 00:08:02,246
<i>And that Manischewitz Grapevine Wine spills in
your ear and tells you you got a sure thing.</i>

65
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:04,770
<i>And what's worse is, you start to believe it.</i>

66
00:08:05,497 --> 00:08:07,647
<i>At least that's how it went with old Max.</i>

67
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,808
<i>Who wasn't so much old, as he was tired.</i>

68
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,615
<i>Tired of being a dog without a day.</i>

69
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:15,975
<i>Tired of waking up and finding
that his dreams were only dreams.</i>

70
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:17,288
We're leaving.

71
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,895
<i>But mostly,
Max was tired of not having a front lawn.</i>

72
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,858
Make sure he doesn't come home late.

73
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:25,330
- I will.
- I was talking to your son.

74
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,697
You think that's funny, do you?

75
00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:29,421
Uh-huh. Bye, Mom.

76
00:08:29,503 --> 00:08:31,653
Yeah. Bye, Mom!

77
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,937
Love you.

78
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:39,293
<i>They're off.</i>

79
00:08:42,665 --> 00:08:45,304
All right, if your ma asks,
where were we today?

80
00:08:45,385 --> 00:08:46,738
- Shea Stadium.
- To see?

81
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:49,703
- Mets v Phillies.
- Good man. Give me the post-game.

82
00:08:49,785 --> 00:08:52,424
Stallard gave up six runs in the first five innings.

83
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:56,659
Ed Kranepool hit a line drive down right field
but it hit the wall, fouled by a foot.

84
00:08:56,747 --> 00:08:59,022
Gonder hit a groundball
between first and second

85
00:08:59,107 --> 00:09:02,259
but he's so slow, second baseman
Tony Taylor tagged him out at first.

86
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:05,505
Did you get all that from the radio?

87
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:06,738
Mm-hm.

88
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:08,421
You're good.

89
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:10,339
OK, I'll be right back.

90
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:12,704
No, no, no. You've got to stay in the car.

91
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:14,347
Why?

92
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,308
Because they don't let little boys inside the track.

93
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,986
Saul's dad takes him to the track.

94
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,301
Well, Saul's dad is a degenerate gambler.

95
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:25,668
And if you're the son of a degenerate gambler,
they let you in.

96
00:09:25,752 --> 00:09:27,708
It's economically viable.

97
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:30,023
Are you going to be a degenerate gambler?

98
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:33,230
Hey. You know better than that.

99
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:36,148
Your old man's smart.
He only plays a sure thing.

100
00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:41,747
Look.
This money's gonna get you through Harvard.

101
00:09:41,836 --> 00:09:43,586
And you're gonna be a doctor.

102
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:44,948
But until then...

103
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:46,945
you've got to stay in the car.

104
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:51,231
Hey.

105
00:09:51,315 --> 00:09:54,149
Next weekend, you and me go to a ballgame.

106
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:55,989
- OK.
- OK.

107
00:09:56,077 --> 00:09:57,795
I love you, kid.

108
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:59,469
I love you too, Dad.

109
00:10:00,157 --> 00:10:02,115
Wait, watch. Watch, watch, watch.

110
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:04,155
I almost forgot. 15 minutes.

111
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:06,194
Start counting.

112
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,272
<i>The next race at the Aqueduct is the tenth race.</i>

113
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,992
<i>- Come on, come on.
The field is making towards</i>

114
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:29,472
<i>the final turn. And Number Seven has moved
into fifth position on the outside.</i>

115
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:31,917
<i>- Number Two has the lead...</i>

116
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:33,560
Come on.

117
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:36,439
<i>Number One is against the rail.</i>

118
00:10:36,523 --> 00:10:40,278
<i>And Number Seven is beginning
to pick up the pace on the outside.</i>

119
00:10:40,364 --> 00:10:41,434
Yes!

120
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:43,322
<i>Yes. Come on, baby. Come on!</i>

121
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:47,354
Let's go!

122
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:51,997
<i>... to challenge. Goes clear
and Number Seven takes the lead!</i>

123
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:53,997
<i>It's Number Seven who now has the lead.</i>

124
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,202
<i>It's strolling clear.</i>

125
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:57,196
Yes!

126
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:00,324
Oh!

127
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:04,644
<i>Number Seven has fallen!</i>

128
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,479
<i>Number One comes home
and takes the lead to win it.</i>

129
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,846
<i>Max woke up to find his dreams
had just been the stuff of pipes.</i>

130
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,887
- I want to place a bet.
- How much?

131
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:16,199
20 large.

132
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,566
Oh, you must feel real lucky.

133
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:22,125
<i>I'll take your bet.</i>

134
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:23,964
And lay it off.

135
00:11:24,052 --> 00:11:25,690
I've got a bookie's bookie.

136
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:28,484
I'll give you 2-1 on the horse.

137
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:31,132
Uh-uh. The racing form says 9-1.

138
00:11:32,412 --> 00:11:35,086
So you go to a ticket vendor
with your 20 grand in hand,

139
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:37,972
and you get 9-1 if the spread sticks.

140
00:11:38,054 --> 00:11:41,730
You come in here with your pockets turned out,
you get 2-1.

141
00:11:41,815 --> 00:11:43,965
The juice is ten.

142
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:48,288
That means if you lose, you're all in for 22 grand.

143
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:50,333
20 for the bet, two for the juice.

144
00:11:51,137 --> 00:11:54,926
Can you pay these monies? Huh? Can you?

145
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:57,537
Yeah.

146
00:12:02,658 --> 00:12:04,614
<i>Just to be clear.</i>

147
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:06,258
<i>If you lose...</i>

148
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:10,132
...you're gonna owe a lot of money
to the kind of men

149
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:15,135
you do not want to owe
the smallest amount of money to.

150
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:29,702
Henry!

151
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:31,893
Henry!

152
00:12:35,786 --> 00:12:37,137
Henry!

153
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:41,103
Henry!

154
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:44,701
Hey, buddy. You got a light?

155
00:12:44,785 --> 00:12:46,742
No. Henry!

156
00:12:46,826 --> 00:12:50,058
In that case, how about the 20 Gs
you just blew on the Seven horse?

157
00:12:50,147 --> 00:12:53,265
- What have you done with my son?
- He's on his way home. Just like you.

158
00:12:53,348 --> 00:12:54,303
Urgh!

159
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:04,462
Where am I?

160
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,658
Roth, he'll tell you everything, I swear.

161
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,187
He already has.

162
00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:26,306
Please.

163
00:13:27,393 --> 00:13:29,349
I have a family.

164
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,226
<i>Please.</i>

165
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:34,953
<i>Please!</i>

166
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:36,707
<i>Where's my boy?</i>

167
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,269
<i>Henry!</i>

168
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:46,227
<i>Where are they?</i>

169
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:51,312
<i>Henry!</i>

170
00:13:53,597 --> 00:13:54,825
<i>Henry!</i>

171
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,110
Fuck.

172
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:12,554
Shit.

173
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:14,074
Jesus.

174
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:16,073
"Fuck, shit, Jesus" is right.

175
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:19,112
I don't understand.
Why did they kill Max's family?

176
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:20,953
New outfit in town.

177
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:25,153
They didn't want somebody else
betting on a fixed horserace with them.

178
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:28,519
Trying to make an impression.

179
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:32,081
That's a fucking story, man.

180
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:36,522
Charlie Chaplin entered a Charlie Chaplin
look-a-like contest in Monte Carlo

181
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:38,561
and came in third.

182
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,601
Now that's a story.

183
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:44,683
This...

184
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,723
This is something else.

185
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:48,763
So that's a Kansas City Shuffle?

186
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,166
No.

187
00:14:50,247 --> 00:14:52,205
It's just the inciting incident.

188
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:55,203
The catalyst.

189
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:59,400
This - is a Kansas City Shuffle.

190
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:02,725
<i>They look right...</i>

191
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:04,880
And you...

192
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,926
go left.

193
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,768
Sorry about that, son.

194
00:15:16,813 --> 00:15:19,486
Sometimes there's more to life than just living.

195
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:23,891
Besides... you can't have a Kansas City Shuffle
without a body.

196
00:16:20,502 --> 00:16:22,459
<i>- He's down!
- Get the roof!</i>

197
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:24,295
<i>Up there!</i>

198
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,908
I'm coming!

199
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:22,591
Coming.

200
00:17:26,354 --> 00:17:28,311
It took you long enough.

201
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:30,828
You're not Nick.

202
00:17:30,915 --> 00:17:33,224
You're not as tall as I thought you'd be.

203
00:17:33,315 --> 00:17:35,272
Well, I'm short for my height.

204
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:40,552
That makes sense because I can usually
tell how tall someone is by their knock.

205
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:43,675
You have a deceptively tall knock.
Congratulations.

206
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,031
So it's a good thing?

207
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:50,149
I open the door expecting you to be up here,
you're down here.

208
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:53,515
That combined with a low centre of gravity -
forget about it.

209
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,272
Who are you?

210
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,793
I'm Slevin.

211
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,870
And what happened to your nose?

212
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,870
I was using it to break some guy's fist.

213
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,916
Somebody hit you?

214
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,070
Yeah... I was kind of expecting it, though.

215
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,754
You were kind of expecting it?

216
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:10,197
Well, they say bad things happen in threes.

217
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:14,715
<i>First... I lost my job.</i>

218
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:18,001
<i>Then I came home to find
my apartment building had been condemned</i>

219
00:18:18,084 --> 00:18:21,600
<i>due to a hybrid breed
of Ecuadorian Super Termites.</i>

220
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,640
<i>So I went to my girlfriend Kelly's.</i>

221
00:18:24,684 --> 00:18:26,720
<i>I had a key so I let myself in.</i>

222
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:39,922
- Hey, don't stop on my account.
- Oh shit!

223
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:43,601
Slevin.

224
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:45,520
It was an accident.

225
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,040
What, like he tripped and you fell?

226
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,647
<i>Slevin, do you know what time it is?</i>

227
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:56,562
I'm at the airport,
are you sure you want me to come out?

228
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:59,881
<i>Yeah. Two weeks in New York
and the only Kelly you'll remember</i>

229
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,599
<i>is the Kelly who gave you your first hand job
on the bus to summer camp.</i>

230
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,445
Kelly Perkins. Said her hands were dry
and she needed...

231
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:10,080
<i>She said that to a lot of guys.
That's why we called her Jerkins Perkins.</i>

232
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:12,731
<i>- Just call me when you land, all right?
- Yeah.</i>

233
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,766
Yeah, I just got into town, Nick.
I'm on my way over to your place.

234
00:19:24,855 --> 00:19:26,812
Say, man, you got the time?

235
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:30,047
Ya, man, it's uh... 7:23.

236
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,090
So you're probably still asleep?

237
00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:34,643
- Yo, you got a smoke?
- No, I don't smoke, man.

238
00:19:34,736 --> 00:19:39,013
<i>Why don't you just go ahead and give me
your wallet and I'll buy my own smokes?</i>

239
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,575
Am I being mugged?

240
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:43,452
Man!

241
00:19:43,537 --> 00:19:45,414
And so here I am.

242
00:19:46,738 --> 00:19:48,694
You said three.

243
00:19:48,778 --> 00:19:51,009
- What?
- You said bad things happen in threes.

244
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:54,809
You lost your job, your apartment was
condemned, Kelly was cheating on you

245
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,652
<i>and you got mugged - that makes four.</i>

246
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,617
When you're on a roll, you're on a roll.

247
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,453
Interesting, although I would add,

248
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,260
not the ever so clever hold-up man
one hears so much about.

249
00:20:03,341 --> 00:20:06,538
- Well, he did break my nose.
- But overlooked your suitcase.

250
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:08,657
Maybe it wouldn't make for a speedy getaway.

251
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,734
True, but then there's the matter of your watch.
Pretty fancy.

252
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:13,654
- It's a fake.
- But he didn't know that.

253
00:20:13,743 --> 00:20:16,462
- Maybe he didn't see it.
- He saw it. He asked you for the time.

254
00:20:16,543 --> 00:20:18,500
You say this was your third mugging?

255
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,143
Uh... I travel a lot.

256
00:20:20,225 --> 00:20:21,977
Where's Nick?

257
00:20:22,065 --> 00:20:25,137
I don't know. He was supposed to
meet me here. He never showed up.

258
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:27,103
<i>- How did you get in?
- Door was open.</i>

259
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:29,255
- Door was open?
- Yeah.

260
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:31,495
- Open or unlocked?
- I don't remember.

261
00:20:31,585 --> 00:20:34,545
- You said open.
- Could have been. What was your name again?

262
00:20:34,627 --> 00:20:36,583
Lindsey. I live across the hall.

263
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:38,898
- Oh.
- I came over to borrow a cup of sugar.

264
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,296
<i>- Where's your cup?
- I came to borrow a cup of sugar.</i>

265
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:43,457
If I had a cup, I'd have come to borrow sugar.

266
00:20:43,547 --> 00:20:45,186
Touché.

267
00:20:45,268 --> 00:20:47,703
Maybe that's Nick. It's right there.

268
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:49,464
Hello?

269
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:52,263
Hello?

270
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,226
They hung up.

271
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,542
I have an idea. Have you used the phone
since you've been here?

272
00:20:59,631 --> 00:21:01,587
No, except for that.

273
00:21:02,432 --> 00:21:03,990
Sorry, wrong number.

274
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:05,791
That was the Hotel Cheval.

275
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:07,670
What are you doing?

276
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:09,585
We know who he called. Who called him?

277
00:21:09,674 --> 00:21:11,905
- Columbo says three things...
- Columbo?

278
00:21:11,995 --> 00:21:15,144
Yeah, Columbo was this TV detective
played by Peter Falk...

279
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,464
I know who Columbo is. Yeah.

280
00:21:17,553 --> 00:21:19,465
He looked for three things at a crime scene.

281
00:21:19,554 --> 00:21:22,864
What's there now that wasn't before.
What was there before that isn't now.

282
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:25,185
- And what's been moved.
- Is this a crime scene?

283
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:27,152
- I think Nick's in trouble.
- Ah.

284
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:28,588
Sorry, wrong number.

285
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:30,631
That was the Hotel Cheval again!

286
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:34,426
So what? He called the hotel,
the hotel called him back. Makes sense.

287
00:21:34,517 --> 00:21:35,870
So, maybe it's a clue.

288
00:21:36,957 --> 00:21:39,189
- A clue to what?
- A clue to what happened to Nick.

289
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,476
<i>- We don't know anything did.
- We don't know anything didn't.</i>

290
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,917
You're here, he's not. The door was open.
Bad things happen where you...

291
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:47,912
Shit. I've got to stop by work.

292
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:51,709
Just for a couple of hours. I'll come back,
then we can start the investigation.

293
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,109
- The investigation?
- Uh-huh. It'll be fun.

294
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,996
OK.

295
00:21:59,081 --> 00:22:01,038
I totally forgot...

296
00:22:02,682 --> 00:22:04,560
Yeah.

297
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:06,358
Sorry.

298
00:22:06,443 --> 00:22:08,832
- May I borrow a cup of sugar?
- What?

299
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:12,595
<i>I never gave it much thought
until I put up a fresh pot of coffee.</i>

300
00:22:12,683 --> 00:22:15,403
I was on my way to the store
and I thought Nick'd have sugar.

301
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:17,919
You tell me your story, I leave, sugarless.

302
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,075
I come back, you put your penis on exhibition.

303
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:23,998
Although the coffee's probably gone bad
by now, I insist on following through.

304
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:26,279
It's like a Norman Rockwell painting.

305
00:22:26,364 --> 00:22:27,513
What, my penis?

306
00:22:27,604 --> 00:22:30,040
No. No, the sugar.

307
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:32,640
<i>Neighbors borrowing sugar from one another.</i>

308
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,603
It's very um... Andy Griffith.

309
00:22:35,366 --> 00:22:36,402
Yeah.

310
00:22:36,487 --> 00:22:39,286
<i>That's Andy Griffith.
The penis thing is not very Mayberry.</i>

311
00:22:39,368 --> 00:22:40,926
No.

312
00:22:41,008 --> 00:22:42,964
Thanks for the sugar... sugar.

313
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:54,285
I wanted to try and catch the next show.

314
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:55,884
I don't go on again till eight.

315
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,486
Whew!

316
00:23:10,413 --> 00:23:12,369
It's not nearly eight o'clock yet.

317
00:23:14,134 --> 00:23:16,365
- The Boss wants to see you.
- Who?

318
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:18,286
- The Boss.
- Who's The Boss?

319
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,491
- The guy we work for.
- Jesus!

320
00:23:21,255 --> 00:23:23,486
Come here and sit your punk ass down.

321
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:25,491
Go.

322
00:23:26,456 --> 00:23:29,416
I'm not the guy you're looking for.
I don't live here.

323
00:23:29,498 --> 00:23:31,454
Well, you look like the guy that lives here.

324
00:23:31,538 --> 00:23:33,891
Then you don't know what he looks like.

325
00:23:33,976 --> 00:23:35,855
He means to say you look like you live here.

326
00:23:35,938 --> 00:23:38,054
Yeah, that's what I mean to say.

327
00:23:38,138 --> 00:23:40,094
I look like I live here, but I don't.

328
00:23:40,178 --> 00:23:42,648
I'm just visiting, I just got in this morning.

329
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,971
The cat I'm looking for, his name is uh...

330
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,414
- His name is Nick, man.
- Nick.

331
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:50,456
The cat's name is Nick. Now...

332
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,578
Who are you?

333
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,979
I'm Slevin.

334
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:58,334
You got some ID?

335
00:24:01,462 --> 00:24:04,024
The funny thing about that is
I got mugged this morning.

336
00:24:04,104 --> 00:24:05,617
Look, look.

337
00:24:05,704 --> 00:24:07,454
Tell it to the One Legged Man.

338
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:09,499
So he can bump it off down the road.

339
00:24:18,705 --> 00:24:21,139
- Hey, listen, motherfucker...
- Yo, I got this.

340
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:23,615
- Slow, slow, slow, slow your roll, man.
- I got this.

341
00:24:23,706 --> 00:24:25,857
Just let me. Just let me, all right?

342
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:27,824
Motherfucker!

343
00:24:27,907 --> 00:24:30,741
All I know is,
The Boss slides me this here address,

344
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:32,785
and he says, "Sloe" - that's him.

345
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:34,427
"Elvis" - that's me.

346
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:37,024
"Bring me the cat
who resides at this here address."

347
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,622
Now he told me that today.

348
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:41,065
You just so happen to be here today.

349
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,300
So I guess you the cat I'm supposed to pick up.

350
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:46,064
Today.

351
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:47,707
But I'm not Nick.

352
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:49,462
Yeah, well, unfortunately for you,

353
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,667
you're not the first cat to tell me
you wasn't the guy I was looking for.

354
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,424
You can ask Lindsey, she lives across the hall.
She lives here.

355
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:58,707
Hold on, man, I ain't asking nobody nothing.

356
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:01,182
Nick, Slevin, Clark Kent -
whatever your name is.

357
00:25:01,274 --> 00:25:04,107
The Virgin Mary could come waltzing up
with her fine ass,

358
00:25:04,194 --> 00:25:05,866
titties hanging out and everything.

359
00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:10,552
If she told me your name was Jesus Christ, I
still gotta take you to see The Boss. Know why?

360
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:11,625
No.

361
00:25:11,716 --> 00:25:13,671
Orders.

362
00:25:13,755 --> 00:25:15,986
Now, you do know what orders is, right?

363
00:25:16,076 --> 00:25:18,269
<i>Orders is orders.</i>

364
00:25:19,274 --> 00:25:23,827
So I guess no-one ever taught you not to use
the word you're defining in the definition?

365
00:25:28,676 --> 00:25:32,272
Say something else, I will break
your motherfucking nose. I ain't playing.

366
00:25:33,037 --> 00:25:34,994
My nose is already broken.

367
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,476
<i>- Can I just say one more thing?
- What?</i>

368
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,028
Can you turn the heat up in here
cos it's really cold?

369
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,635
Uh... yeah.

370
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:52,679
Y-You... You should have thought about that
before you started in with all the lip.

371
00:26:21,487 --> 00:26:23,842
Ah, Jeez.

372
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:38,201
- It's cold out there.
- Let's hurry it up, man.

373
00:26:50,532 --> 00:26:52,488
Yo, grab his ass.

374
00:26:56,293 --> 00:26:58,250
<i>The boss is right up there, chump.</i>

375
00:27:18,735 --> 00:27:20,090
Well, listen.

376
00:27:20,177 --> 00:27:22,850
Your boys Elvis and Sloe
picked up the wrong guy.

377
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,974
<i>- I'm not Nick Fisher.
- Mr. Fisher?</i>

378
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:30,054
Are you familiar with The Shmoo, Mr. Fisher?

379
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:33,056
A comic strip I liked as a boy.

380
00:27:33,781 --> 00:27:36,134
The Shmoo was a loveable creature, really.

381
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:37,971
<i>Laid eggs...</i>

382
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,696
gave milk...

383
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,812
...and died of sheer ecstasy
when looked at with hunger.

384
00:27:46,781 --> 00:27:48,738
The Shmoo loved to be eaten.

385
00:27:48,822 --> 00:27:50,972
It could taste like any food you desire.

386
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:55,419
Shmoo hide, cut thin, made fine leather.

387
00:27:57,064 --> 00:27:59,817
<i>Even Shmoo whiskers
made excellent toothpicks.</i>

388
00:28:01,064 --> 00:28:04,421
In essence, the Shmoo supplied
all of the world's wants.

389
00:28:05,906 --> 00:28:10,341
I only bring up the Shmoo because it's relevant
to you and why you were brought here.

390
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:11,744
I'm sorry, who are you?

391
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:13,304
I'm The Boss.

392
00:28:13,385 --> 00:28:15,102
I thought he was The Boss.

393
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:16,859
Why?

394
00:28:17,705 --> 00:28:19,139
Do we look alike?

395
00:28:20,226 --> 00:28:24,265
So, Mr. Fisher...
you were gonna tell me something?

396
00:28:24,346 --> 00:28:26,304
I don't know, you brought me here.

397
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:27,707
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

398
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:29,744
Back when you thought I was him.

399
00:28:30,468 --> 00:28:32,825
I never thought you were him.
I thought he was you.

400
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,868
I was trying to tell him, you...
that they picked up the wrong guy.

401
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,340
- Wrong guy for what?
- What you wanted to see me about.

402
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:40,422
- Know what I wanted to see you about?
- No.

403
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,467
Then how do you know I have the wrong guy?

404
00:28:42,551 --> 00:28:45,701
- Because I'm not...
- Maybe I wanted to give you $96,000.

405
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,782
In that case, do I still have the wrong guy?

406
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,067
Do you want to give me $96,000?

407
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:54,110
<i>No, do you want to give me $96,000?</i>

408
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:55,545
No, should I?

409
00:28:55,632 --> 00:28:57,544
I don't know, should you?

410
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:01,750
I don't know, should I?

411
00:29:06,915 --> 00:29:08,507
Long story short.

412
00:29:09,395 --> 00:29:13,355
- I think we're well past that point.
- I'll bet it was that mouth that got you that nose.

413
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:21,112
OK, I'm under the impression that you're
under the impression that I owe you $96,000.

414
00:29:21,196 --> 00:29:23,552
No, you owe Slim Hopkins $96,000.

415
00:29:25,518 --> 00:29:27,474
You owe Slim, Slim owes me.

416
00:29:28,318 --> 00:29:29,637
You owe me.

417
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,876
<i>Well, in that case. Is Slim around?</i>

418
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,600
Hey, Slim. Do you know this cat?

419
00:29:46,722 --> 00:29:47,677
Slim?

420
00:29:49,602 --> 00:29:50,956
No use.

421
00:29:52,284 --> 00:29:55,194
Ever since somebody shot him,
old Slim went deaf.

422
00:29:56,242 --> 00:29:58,199
What happened to make Slim go deaf?

423
00:29:58,283 --> 00:29:59,512
Why?

424
00:30:01,284 --> 00:30:05,722
Because I owe you $96,000 and I might have
a slight problem coming up with the money.

425
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,158
Oh, OK.

426
00:30:07,245 --> 00:30:10,602
Well, why don't we just make it an even 90?

427
00:30:12,606 --> 00:30:14,757
I may have exaggerated the slightness.

428
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:17,563
Hm.

429
00:30:17,648 --> 00:30:22,086
Well, why don't I just cancel the whole debt
in exchange for a small favor?

430
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,366
Well, that depends on the favor.

431
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:32,321
<i>That was my son.</i>

432
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:35,325
Notice how I said "was"?

433
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,127
Yeah.

434
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,166
That's because he's dead.

435
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,123
Murdered.

436
00:30:44,892 --> 00:30:46,848
Relegated to the past tense.

437
00:30:48,892 --> 00:30:52,603
<i>Sent from an is to a was
before he'd had his breakfast.</i>

438
00:30:53,654 --> 00:30:55,406
Bummer.

439
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:03,691
Lex Talionis.

440
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:06,050
The Law of Retaliation.

441
00:31:21,097 --> 00:31:23,054
<i>A pact was broken.</i>

442
00:31:23,138 --> 00:31:26,814
My son was murdered,
so The Rabbi's son must share the same fate.

443
00:31:27,699 --> 00:31:29,258
Whose son?

444
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,978
The Rabbi's.

445
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,016
Why do they call him The Rabbi?

446
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,419
Because...

447
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:38,732
Because he's a rabbi.

448
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:40,776
Who's his son?

449
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,421
- Yitzchok.
- Yitzchok. Yitzchok and The Rabbi.

450
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:45,492
Yitzchok the Fairy.

451
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:48,819
Why do they call him The Fairy?

452
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:54,018
Because he's a fairy.

453
00:31:54,103 --> 00:31:57,381
He has wings, can fly?
Sprinkles magic dust all over the place?

454
00:31:57,465 --> 00:31:59,421
- He's homosexual.
- Right.

455
00:31:59,505 --> 00:32:01,462
Come on.

456
00:32:04,586 --> 00:32:07,180
- So how does The Rabbi feel about that?
- He doesn't know.

457
00:32:07,266 --> 00:32:09,416
- You know, but he doesn't?
- Everybody knows.

458
00:32:09,507 --> 00:32:11,257
- Except The Rabbi.
- That's right.

459
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:14,021
So where do I fit in?

460
00:32:14,105 --> 00:32:15,698
You?

461
00:32:17,107 --> 00:32:19,063
You're the trigger man.

462
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:21,907
Me?

463
00:32:21,988 --> 00:32:23,740
You.

464
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:34,390
Aren't there professionals?
People you can hire to do this sort of thing?

465
00:32:35,151 --> 00:32:37,062
Of course there are.

466
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:38,106
Yes.

467
00:32:39,152 --> 00:32:41,109
But you owe me $96,000.

468
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:45,152
Why should I go out and pay someone else
when I've already paid you?

469
00:32:45,233 --> 00:32:51,183
Hm. Sorry, kid,
but your money just isn't long enough.

470
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:52,752
Which means you're in my pocket.

471
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:55,474
Which means
if you don't do what I want you to do,

472
00:32:55,555 --> 00:32:58,023
you're gonna go from my pocket to my fridge.

473
00:33:00,034 --> 00:33:01,991
Slim could use the company.

474
00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:03,872
I could use the Shmoo.

475
00:33:03,955 --> 00:33:06,025
So I'll expect your answer by morning.

476
00:33:07,597 --> 00:33:09,553
Is there anything else?

477
00:33:10,317 --> 00:33:13,833
Well, I don't suppose I have to say anything
as trite and clichéd as,

478
00:33:13,918 --> 00:33:16,035
"Go to the police and you're a dead man."

479
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,349
I think you just did.

480
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:19,918
I guess I did.

481
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:26,392
So, let me see if I've got this right.

482
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,716
I'm paying you a lot of money to kill somebody
and you're getting somebody else to do it?

483
00:33:35,201 --> 00:33:36,681
Don't worry.

484
00:33:37,722 --> 00:33:39,678
I'm gonna kill somebody.

485
00:33:45,964 --> 00:33:47,557
Better call Brikowski.

486
00:33:47,645 --> 00:33:49,202
Tell him there's a new face in town.

487
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,408
- Hey.
- Nick still hasn't shown, huh?

488
00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:29,322
- No.
- What's with you and that towel?

489
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:30,967
Oh... Lindsey...

490
00:34:31,729 --> 00:34:35,121
- It's a very long story.
- Get dressed, and tell me about it on the way.

491
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:36,485
Where are we going?

492
00:34:36,571 --> 00:34:39,404
All we know is that somebody called Nick
from the Hotel Cheval.

493
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:41,447
<i>I spoke to a friend who works there.</i>

494
00:34:41,531 --> 00:34:43,488
<i>They keep a record of every call made.</i>

495
00:34:43,572 --> 00:34:47,851
<i>She can access the computer and we can
find out what room the call came from.</i>

496
00:34:47,933 --> 00:34:49,572
What is it?

497
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,610
<i>- I know this guy.
- Who?</i>

498
00:34:51,694 --> 00:34:53,094
This guy.

499
00:34:54,495 --> 00:34:56,451
You know that guy?

500
00:34:56,535 --> 00:34:58,446
Yeah, I met him.

501
00:34:58,535 --> 00:34:59,889
He was dead.

502
00:35:02,336 --> 00:35:04,291
You met a dead guy?

503
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:06,332
Yeah.

504
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:08,372
In a walk-in freezer.

505
00:35:11,898 --> 00:35:14,970
Bookmaker Slim Hopkins reported missing.
Police have no leads.

506
00:35:15,058 --> 00:35:16,616
Blah, blah, blah. Yada, yada...

507
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:20,579
A spokesperson commented off the record,
"Ironic that Hopkins should go missing,

508
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:25,291
considering he's allegedly been behind
a few disappearing acts himself."

509
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:32,453
I think it's time you told me that story
about why you're still wearing that towel.

510
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:34,897
Do you mind if I get dressed first?

511
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:37,621
Could be my friend from the hotel. Be right back.

512
00:35:41,102 --> 00:35:42,660
Hm.

513
00:35:53,225 --> 00:35:56,535
Hey, Lindsey, I don't think it's such a good idea
that we continue to...

514
00:35:58,386 --> 00:36:00,661
Put your shoes on, Schlomo wants to see you.

515
00:36:04,227 --> 00:36:06,184
I don't know anyone named Schlomo.

516
00:36:07,228 --> 00:36:10,699
Someone named Schlomo knows you.
That is your only concern.

517
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:12,143
Let's go.

518
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,980
Like I said, I don't know...

519
00:36:15,788 --> 00:36:17,746
Aaahh... better...

520
00:36:18,749 --> 00:36:21,309
I think it's better if you let me do the talking.

521
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:22,822
You think?

522
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,226
What is it?

523
00:36:33,272 --> 00:36:34,625
He's sorry that he hit you.

524
00:36:34,712 --> 00:36:36,668
<i>- Do you always speak for him?
- Yes.</i>

525
00:36:38,754 --> 00:36:40,426
Hm.

526
00:36:40,514 --> 00:36:42,470
So, he's a mute, then.

527
00:36:42,554 --> 00:36:43,509
Not quite.

528
00:36:43,594 --> 00:36:45,552
Well, what, then?

529
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,102
It's personal. You'll have to ask him.

530
00:36:48,194 --> 00:36:50,150
- Hm. How would he tell me?
- He wouldn't.

531
00:36:54,955 --> 00:36:56,866
- Hey, are we going to the?
- No.

532
00:36:56,956 --> 00:36:59,265
- But he's right there.
- A different outfit entirely.

533
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:02,594
<i>Right across the street from one another?</i>

534
00:37:02,677 --> 00:37:06,830
At one time they were one with one another.
And then they tried to kill one another.

535
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:12,356
<i>And now neither man leaves
his respective tower of isolation</i>

536
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,795
for fear of what the other man will do to him.

537
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:25,635
Let me guess, all the way up?

538
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:30,357
Penthouse.

539
00:37:57,886 --> 00:38:00,035
You must be Mr. Fisher.

540
00:38:02,525 --> 00:38:05,439
Must I? Because... that hasn't been
working out for me lately.

541
00:38:05,527 --> 00:38:08,166
- But I'm afraid you must.
- Well, if I must.

542
00:38:09,368 --> 00:38:11,723
Do you know for what reason
you've been brought here?

543
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:17,002
For starters, I'm unlucky.

544
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,924
The unlucky are nothing more than
a frame of reference for the lucky, Mr. Fisher.

545
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,764
You are unlucky so I may know that I am not.

546
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:27,288
Unfortunately, the lucky never realize
they are lucky until it's too late.

547
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:30,843
Take yourself for instance. Yesterday
you were better off than you are today,

548
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:36,087
but it took today for you to realize it. But...
today has arrived, and it's too late, you see?

549
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:39,444
<i>People are never happy with what they have.</i>

550
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:43,845
They always want what they had,
or what someone else has.

551
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:46,244
Kinda like a rabbi
who would rather be a gangster,

552
00:38:46,335 --> 00:38:48,246
a gangster who would rather be a rabbi.

553
00:38:48,335 --> 00:38:49,370
I mean, what is that?

554
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:52,527
Some sort of grass is always greener
on the other side of the fence thing?

555
00:38:52,615 --> 00:38:55,767
<i>I mean, how do you justify being a rabbi</i>

556
00:38:55,857 --> 00:38:57,927
and a gangster?

557
00:39:01,738 --> 00:39:03,411
I don't.

558
00:39:03,499 --> 00:39:06,455
I'm a bad man who doesn't waste time
wondering what could've been,

559
00:39:06,537 --> 00:39:08,529
when I am what could've been or not have been.

560
00:39:08,618 --> 00:39:12,248
I live on both sides of the fence,
and my grass is always green.

561
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:14,856
Consider, Mr. Fisher...

562
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,371
...there are two men sitting here before you,

563
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,338
and one of them you should be very afraid of.
Where's my money?

564
00:39:21,621 --> 00:39:24,340
- I've been hearing that a lot lately.
- My father used to say,

565
00:39:24,421 --> 00:39:27,016
"The first time somebody calls you a horse,
you punch him.

566
00:39:27,102 --> 00:39:29,742
The second time somebody calls you a horse,
call him a jerk.

567
00:39:29,823 --> 00:39:33,942
But the third time somebody calls you a horse,
perhaps it's time to go shopping for a saddle."

568
00:39:43,224 --> 00:39:46,899
- I don't have your money.
- This isn't like skipping out on the check.

569
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:50,261
You owe me money.
I have interests, you owe them money.

570
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:53,143
- I don't even know how much money I owe you.
- $33,000.

571
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,536
- But I'm not Nick fisher.
- Then who the hell are you?

572
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:58,778
I'm just a guy who was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

573
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:03,985
You have 48 hours to get my money.

574
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:07,300
Saul will keep an eye on you.
In the meantime, you may go now.

575
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:14,665
Wait, I just have one question.

576
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,186
I wasn't frisked.

577
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:27,431
I see. So, being a rabbi, a... a religious man...

578
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:31,710
There are three things a Jew may not do
in order to save a life, including his own.

579
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:37,551
He may not idol-worship, commit adultery,
or perform an act of premeditated murder.

580
00:40:38,274 --> 00:40:40,584
Killing you before you killed me
would have been...

581
00:40:40,675 --> 00:40:42,631
Kosher.

582
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:46,630
Acceptable.

583
00:41:05,758 --> 00:41:08,115
I've wired half the money
to your bank in the Caymans.

584
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,317
The other half will be deposited
when our old friend is in the ground.

585
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,357
Now I can expect that when?

586
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:19,917
- Very soon.
- Good.

587
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:22,596
So, tell me. The kid...

588
00:41:23,402 --> 00:41:25,356
<i>What do you want with him?</i>

589
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:29,592
The kid and I have unfinished business.

590
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:41,844
If there's one thing I know,
it's when someone is lying.

591
00:41:41,925 --> 00:41:44,075
A man in my position, it's all he has to go on.

592
00:41:45,565 --> 00:41:49,036
To know a lie when he hears it,
it's the difference between life and death -

593
00:41:49,126 --> 00:41:50,799
your own, someone else's.

594
00:41:50,887 --> 00:41:53,846
That being said, he wasn't lying.

595
00:41:55,008 --> 00:41:56,361
That's not Nick Fisher.

596
00:41:57,489 --> 00:41:58,524
I know.

597
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:13,202
I came back here, you were gone. So,
I went to the hotel without you to see my friend.

598
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:16,123
She says the call to Nick came from Room 1009.

599
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,841
A fellow registered under the name of Smith,
if you can believe that.

600
00:42:19,932 --> 00:42:23,641
It's one of the most common names in the world,
so there's bound to be a couple of 'em.

601
00:42:23,732 --> 00:42:25,928
But I get the feeling that this ain't one of 'em.

602
00:42:26,013 --> 00:42:28,926
I get up to the tenth floor, and just as I do,

603
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:32,769
the door to room 1009 opens
and there's our Mr. Smith. In the flesh.

604
00:42:32,855 --> 00:42:37,564
So, I pretend I'm walking to the elevator instead
of coming from it and we take it down together.

605
00:42:37,654 --> 00:42:39,691
He smiles at me - thanks - I smile back.

606
00:42:40,615 --> 00:42:43,004
<i>But I have no idea who he is
but I think you might.</i>

607
00:42:43,095 --> 00:42:46,293
<i>So I take a picture using my cellphone
which I thought was a total waste</i>

608
00:42:46,376 --> 00:42:48,811
cos the photos look like shit and I never use it.

609
00:42:48,897 --> 00:42:53,847
So there I am pretending to dial a number,
and taking Smith's picture - him none the wiser.

610
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:56,769
This is Smith. Recognize him?

611
00:42:56,859 --> 00:42:57,609
No.

612
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,016
I didn't think you would, but it was worth a shot.
Anyway, we take the elevator to the lobby,

613
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,810
and the man who calls himself Smith
walks outside and hails himself a cab.

614
00:43:06,901 --> 00:43:08,651
So I followed him.

615
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,133
<i>He went down
into an apartment building downtown.</i>

616
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:19,292
<i>So I wait. An hour goes by.</i>

617
00:43:20,542 --> 00:43:23,578
And just when I'm getting ready to leave -
who walks outside?

618
00:43:23,661 --> 00:43:25,415
- Smith?
- You.

619
00:43:29,823 --> 00:43:30,573
Me?

620
00:43:32,465 --> 00:43:36,424
<i>You out of the same building
with two Hasidic Jews on either side of you.</i>

621
00:43:37,385 --> 00:43:39,217
Friends of yours?

622
00:43:40,226 --> 00:43:41,625
Not exactly.

623
00:43:41,706 --> 00:43:43,854
I think it's time you told me that story.

624
00:43:45,265 --> 00:43:48,303
Well, there's this guy
and they call him The Boss, right?

625
00:43:49,345 --> 00:43:52,622
And then, right across the street
there's this man they call The Rabbi.

626
00:43:52,706 --> 00:43:55,744
- Why do they call him The Rabbi?
- Because he's a rabbi.

627
00:44:03,229 --> 00:44:06,142
So now I have to "take out",
to use the vernacular,

628
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,028
The Fairy, in order to scratch a debt
that isn't even mine.

629
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:14,708
And if that's not enough, I have 48 hours to
come up with $33,000 or The Rabbi's gonna...

630
00:44:15,672 --> 00:44:17,627
I don't know who Mr. Smith is.

631
00:44:18,511 --> 00:44:21,344
And the worst part about it is,
I'm not Nick Fisher.

632
00:44:22,111 --> 00:44:22,862
Ironic.

633
00:44:23,873 --> 00:44:25,511
I know, I don't even gamble.

634
00:44:25,593 --> 00:44:28,630
No, I mean the mobster having a gay son.
That's ironic.

635
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:34,233
We are dealing with a bona fide case
of mistaken identity here.

636
00:44:34,315 --> 00:44:38,025
Things like that aren't supposed to be real.
It's like amnesia.

637
00:44:38,116 --> 00:44:42,233
Notwithstanding, here you are,
and Nick's nowhere to be found, so...

638
00:44:42,315 --> 00:44:44,512
I'd say you're fucked.

639
00:44:44,597 --> 00:44:46,508
Fucked.

640
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:52,073
Shouldn't you be a little worried about this?

641
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:54,352
I have Ataraxia.

642
00:44:54,437 --> 00:44:55,586
Ataraxia?

643
00:44:56,678 --> 00:45:01,707
It's a condition characterized by freedom
from worry or any other preoccupation really.

644
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,190
I have to have my answer
to The Boss in the morning.

645
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,236
Oh, what are you gonna say?

646
00:45:09,561 --> 00:45:12,155
What a man with two penises would say
when his tailor asks him

647
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:14,710
- if he dresses to the right or to the left.
- What's that?

648
00:45:17,283 --> 00:45:18,159
Yes.

649
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,040
I knew you had sense.

650
00:45:22,604 --> 00:45:25,358
Sense is something you have
when you have a choice.

651
00:45:25,445 --> 00:45:27,195
Sometimes.

652
00:45:27,283 --> 00:45:29,639
Sometimes it's when you know you don't.

653
00:45:31,084 --> 00:45:34,520
Nah, don't move that bishop!
It's an obvious sucker bet.

654
00:45:35,284 --> 00:45:37,753
If you don't, y-y-you can have him in four moves.

655
00:45:37,845 --> 00:45:40,154
If you do, he's gonna have you in mate in one.

656
00:45:43,047 --> 00:45:44,560
He doesn't see it.

657
00:45:44,647 --> 00:45:47,207
Wouldn't matter if he did.

658
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:48,720
Elvis lets me win.

659
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:51,925
<i>Everybody lets me win.</i>

660
00:45:52,689 --> 00:45:55,523
Wait a minute. You know this game?

661
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,282
You got three days.

662
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,728
I was thinking it would take me a week.

663
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:10,200
Oh, you were thinking that, were you?

664
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:14,331
With all your experience killing people?
I'll tell you what.

665
00:46:16,413 --> 00:46:18,324
You win this game, you got your week.

666
00:46:22,733 --> 00:46:23,370
Hm.

667
00:46:33,495 --> 00:46:36,292
So, what's the plan with Yitzchok?

668
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:39,412
Was gonna play it by ear.

669
00:46:39,494 --> 00:46:42,533
Well, if it's all the same,
I'd write it down. It's a tough tune.

670
00:46:44,016 --> 00:46:46,007
And, by the way, he has shadows.

671
00:46:49,698 --> 00:46:51,450
Shadows?

672
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,052
Bodyguards.

673
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,736
With him all the time.

674
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:03,338
Military.

675
00:47:08,222 --> 00:47:10,176
Ex-Israeli Mossad.

676
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:15,460
They go where he goes,
round-the-clock. Ex-Israeli Mossad.

677
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,498
Ex-Israeli Mossad.

678
00:47:20,022 --> 00:47:21,172
That doesn't sound good.

679
00:47:22,343 --> 00:47:24,494
<i>They live in the apartment next door.</i>

680
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,580
He wears a panic button on a chain
around his neck.

681
00:47:27,665 --> 00:47:29,701
<i>Looks like an ordinary Star of David.</i>

682
00:47:30,545 --> 00:47:33,776
He presses that button
and, well, we all know how that ends.

683
00:47:33,865 --> 00:47:35,219
What's this?

684
00:47:36,346 --> 00:47:37,415
Oh, God! No, you didn't?

685
00:47:40,387 --> 00:47:42,060
Get down!

686
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:45,902
<i>Response time's gonna be
three to five seconds.</i>

687
00:47:46,627 --> 00:47:48,823
He's gonna have to hit him
when he least expects it.

688
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,864
Where?

689
00:47:50,948 --> 00:47:53,668
- Where?
- The apartment.

690
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:58,585
How do I get in his apartment?
I can't just walk in the front door.

691
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,585
No, I was thinking you'd use the back door.

692
00:48:08,832 --> 00:48:10,823
Then what?

693
00:48:10,912 --> 00:48:13,062
He does the kid, I do him.

694
00:48:13,953 --> 00:48:16,422
I plant my gun. Clean, no history.

695
00:48:16,514 --> 00:48:20,506
And Yitzchok - fire a round,
get some powder burns on the hands.

696
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:25,383
Take the clothes off - make it look like a,

697
00:48:25,474 --> 00:48:29,991
"You do me, I do you, we're both gay, the
world doesn't understand us," double suicide.

698
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:33,027
And that's all there is to it.

699
00:48:34,116 --> 00:48:36,186
Is that all there is to it?

700
00:48:36,276 --> 00:48:38,666
Yeah. It's all there is to it.

701
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,149
Peww!

702
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,077
I'm not such a bad guy, you know.

703
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:56,869
<i>Some folks have grown pretty fat off me.</i>

704
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,476
Some have grown pretty dead.

705
00:49:05,881 --> 00:49:07,281
You're a conundrum, you.

706
00:49:09,522 --> 00:49:13,961
You walk in here shooting your fucking mouth off
like you don't give a fuck if it gets shot off.

707
00:49:15,204 --> 00:49:16,557
You can only kill me once.

708
00:49:24,245 --> 00:49:24,995
Checkmate.

709
00:49:31,244 --> 00:49:33,201
Nobody says I have to kill you quick.

710
00:49:36,446 --> 00:49:38,198
Cat.

711
00:49:39,246 --> 00:49:40,998
Mouse.

712
00:49:42,607 --> 00:49:44,563
You've got three days.

713
00:49:48,368 --> 00:49:50,325
Excuse me.

714
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:11,851
Who the fuck is this guy?

715
00:50:12,813 --> 00:50:16,123
<i>Dunno. But whoever he is, he's either in
very deep shit or I don't know what.</i>

716
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:20,891
Because he's playing in the sandbox with
the Darkies, the Skullcaps and who knows who.

717
00:50:20,975 --> 00:50:24,855
Call Murph and see if he got a match
on that photo Marty snapped.

718
00:50:24,936 --> 00:50:26,927
Yes, boss.

719
00:50:27,016 --> 00:50:30,291
I want a complete rundown on this fucker.
Everything from A to Z.

720
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:33,255
Who he is. Who does he know?
The people he knows, who do they know?

721
00:50:33,337 --> 00:50:36,693
I want to know
what the fuck he is doing in my fucking city.

722
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,852
- What have you got?
- Get this.

723
00:50:47,939 --> 00:50:50,328
The Kat's in town.

724
00:50:50,419 --> 00:50:51,569
Goodkat?

725
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:54,220
- It's the song junkies are singing.
- What's the happenstance?

726
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:58,135
Didn't know the happenstance.
Just said the word was the Kat's in town.

727
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,230
Um... who's er... who's Goodkat?

728
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,754
<i>Real heavy hitter.</i>

729
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,752
- The heaviest.
- He shows, people die, he vanishes.

730
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,274
No-one knows who he is, or what he looks like.

731
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,238
And he hasn't worked New York
in, like, two decades.

732
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,276
<i>Just what we need.</i>

733
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,475
All right.

734
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:20,189
And get some different fucking coffee in here,
will you? I gotta get to the fucking morgue.

735
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,838
- Hey! I figured it out.
- Hey. What did you figure out?

736
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,354
You said that Slim Hopkins worked
for The Boss, right?

737
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,158
Well, listen.

738
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,071
The Rabbi also had a bookie - Benny Begin.

739
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,833
Benny's at the morgue.
Somebody killed him and his goons.

740
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,070
- The morgue?
- Didn't I say I was a coroner?

741
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,832
No, you didn't say you were a coroner.

742
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,716
Benny Begin - killed by a baseball.

743
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,158
My guess was a fastball.

744
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,077
Well, either way it proves
that the good Lord has a sense of humor.

745
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,878
- Good morning, Detective.
- Morning.

746
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,077
- You know this guy?
- Big-time bookie. Worked for The Rabbi.

747
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,993
- Why do they call him The Rabbi?
- Because he's a rabbi.

748
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,911
Between you and me...

749
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,389
20 years ago he used to be my bookie.
I used to sign my pay cheques over to him.

750
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,280
What about the other two?
Did you get anything on them yet?

751
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,237
These two were poisoned.

752
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,675
Something exotic.

753
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,035
- I'm running it down.
- Well, let me know.

754
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,872
<i>Will do.</i>

755
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,350
Prick.

756
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,913
- Have a good day.
- You too, Detective.

757
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,317
Jimmy, I'm taking my lunch break.

758
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,430
Don't you see?
Nick isn't missing, he's hiding. He set you up.

759
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,272
- Nick set me up?
- Like a bowling pin.

760
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,828
Nick found himself in a jam.
He got you to take his place.

761
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,435
He paid a street thug to mug you,
but all he wants is your wallet and license

762
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,272
<i>so he ignores the watch and suitcase.</i>

763
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,112
<i>Then Nick kills Slim Hopkins and Benny.</i>

764
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,636
The only guys who know what he looks like,
and now you're left holding the bag!

765
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,269
- But I called Nick. I initiated contact.
- Well, maybe it just seems that way.

766
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,033
- What about Smith?
- I still can't figure him out in all this.

767
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,439
Hm.

768
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,829
- You should run.
- I can't.

769
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,593
- They'll kill you if you stay.
- They'll kill me if I leave.

770
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,558
- Go to the police!
- These guys buy cops like cops buy doughnuts.

771
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,596
This isn't the first time this has happened.

772
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,036
This isn't the first time a crime lord asked you
to kill the gay son of a rival

773
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,669
to pay off a friend's debt whose place you're
staying in because you lost your job

774
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,671
and found your girlfriend with another guy?

775
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,436
It is the first time it happened. But Nick has been
painting me into a corner since we were kids.

776
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,715
I guess I've always been a better friend to him...

777
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,554
Yeah, I'd love to hear the rest of this
but I've really gotta go back to work.

778
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,710
- Oh, hey. Hey.
- Hey.

779
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:44,316
I was just thinking that if you're still alive
when I get back from work tonight, maybe...

780
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,915
I don't know,
we could go to dinner or something?

781
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,153
Yeah, that would be great, yeah.

782
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,196
- Really?
- Yeah.

783
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,759
Yeah.

784
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,752
OK. Um... No. Bye.

785
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,712
Hm...

786
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,268
Weird.

787
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,479
What?

788
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,599
I was just thinking about what it would be like
if we'd met under different circumstances.

789
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,593
See, I think people should only fall in love
if there's a great story behind how they met.

790
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,273
You know, seeing as you have to tell it
over and over again.

791
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,756
If you and I fell in love,
we'd have one hell of a story to tell.

792
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,912
We'd be at a dinner party and someone
would ask, "How'd you two meet?"

793
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,120
And I'd say, "You tell the story, dear."
And you'd say, "No, you tell it better."

794
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,748
So, come here often?

795
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,430
No. But I heard about someone who does.

796
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,551
- You mean... The Fairy?
- Yeah.

797
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,596
- Is he?
- Yeah.

798
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,110
Where?

799
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:08,174
Look over there.
He's got bodyguards.

800
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,978
Aside from that, you're pretty much dead-on.

801
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:14,767
- Bodyguards?
- Yeah. Right behind him. Two of them. Israelis.

802
00:55:15,499 --> 00:55:17,329
Beards. Right behind him.

803
00:55:18,258 --> 00:55:20,213
<i>See 'em?</i>

804
00:55:22,897 --> 00:55:24,933
- You're getting good at this.
- Thanks.

805
00:55:25,017 --> 00:55:26,735
How are you gonna have a talk with him?

806
00:55:26,817 --> 00:55:29,092
When he goes to the bathroom,
I'll follow him in.

807
00:55:29,936 --> 00:55:31,892
What do you think?

808
00:55:32,776 --> 00:55:34,926
<i>Could someone tell me why I'm in the van?</i>

809
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,491
<i>Because I could only get a reservation for two.</i>

810
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,448
<i>All right, The Fairy's at a table in the middle.</i>

811
00:55:42,535 --> 00:55:43,887
<i>Bodyguards nearby.</i>

812
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:47,853
<i>Our boy's not far away
but I can't make out who's with him.</i>

813
00:55:47,934 --> 00:55:51,482
<i>- Did Murph get a beat on him yet?
- Murph says, whoever he is, he's a ghost.</i>

814
00:55:51,573 --> 00:55:55,087
<i>Can't find anyone who's ever even
bumped into him, much less tripped over him.</i>

815
00:55:59,811 --> 00:56:01,961
<i>The Fairy's going to the bathroom.</i>

816
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,879
<i>And our boy's making a move. Shit.</i>

817
00:56:28,687 --> 00:56:30,996
<i>- Marty, the door's locked.
- Relax.</i>

818
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:33,726
It's not gonna go down in the men's room.

819
00:56:37,605 --> 00:56:39,561
I got it next.

820
00:56:42,325 --> 00:56:44,394
- What went down in the men's room?
- We talked.

821
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,234
And?

822
00:56:45,324 --> 00:56:47,315
I told him I thought we should get together.

823
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,757
- You didn't?
- I did.

824
00:56:48,844 --> 00:56:50,675
And?

825
00:56:50,764 --> 00:56:53,596
- I got a date.
- Do you think this is safe?

826
00:56:53,683 --> 00:56:57,561
It can't be any worse than what's waiting for me
behind door number two.

827
00:56:58,722 --> 00:57:00,917
It's gonna be tough. I think I picked up a pigtail.

828
00:57:01,002 --> 00:57:03,117
- A what?
- The cops.

829
00:57:03,201 --> 00:57:06,352
Oh, a pig tail. Cute.

830
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,509
I ran into a nosy cop in the men's room.

831
00:57:19,398 --> 00:57:21,354
You and me need to talk.

832
00:57:24,398 --> 00:57:27,389
- Do I know you?
- No, but I know you.

833
00:57:34,716 --> 00:57:36,707
Listen, I'm sorry, no offence, but I'm not...

834
00:57:36,796 --> 00:57:38,433
I'm not gay.

835
00:57:38,515 --> 00:57:42,508
- I'm a cop.
- Well, I'm not a robber if you catch my drift?

836
00:57:43,475 --> 00:57:45,227
I've been watching you.

837
00:57:45,315 --> 00:57:49,910
I know what you're into.
Who are you? I mean, I know who you're not.

838
00:57:49,994 --> 00:57:52,633
You're not Nick Fisher.
The guy whose apartment you're in.

839
00:57:52,714 --> 00:57:55,352
I know because Nick
spent eight years in Dade Correctional

840
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:58,266
for forcing himself on a 14-year-old cheerleader.

841
00:57:58,353 --> 00:58:00,308
Dade County sent me a picture of Nick Fisher.

842
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,269
And you... are not him.

843
00:58:02,352 --> 00:58:05,627
So... who the fuck are you?

844
00:58:09,631 --> 00:58:11,986
I'm just a guy whose dinner's getting cold.

845
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:15,021
May I leave now?

846
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:16,782
- Come here.
- What?

847
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:21,817
Dead bodies in refrigerators. Cops in men's
rooms. You remind me of... James Bond.

848
00:58:26,108 --> 00:58:28,463
That is the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

849
00:58:28,548 --> 00:58:30,425
And The Boss, he could be Kananga.

850
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:31,257
Kananga?

851
00:58:32,868 --> 00:58:35,141
- No, The Boss is no Kananga.
- Well, who's The Boss?

852
00:58:35,226 --> 00:58:37,182
Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

853
00:58:38,066 --> 00:58:41,502
Which one? Donald Pleasance?
Telly Savalas? Max von Sydow?

854
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:45,775
You know your Bond.
But alas, I was referring to Anthony Dawson.

855
00:58:45,865 --> 00:58:47,423
Who?

856
00:58:47,505 --> 00:58:50,099
Well, he played Blofeld
in From Russia With Love.

857
00:58:50,185 --> 00:58:53,494
Well, you never see Blofeld's face
in From Russia With Love.

858
00:58:53,584 --> 00:58:57,782
And that's when the villain is most effective,
when you don't know what he looks like.

859
00:59:14,741 --> 00:59:16,697
So...

860
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,295
See you later.

861
00:59:47,055 --> 00:59:50,013
Ah, that was incredible!
- You...

862
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:56,172
- I just realized something.
- What's that?

863
00:59:56,254 --> 00:59:59,245
- I just made love to you.
- You're just realizing that now?

864
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:03,690
And I have no idea who specifically you were
referring to when you said James Bond.

865
01:00:03,773 --> 01:00:07,891
Because earlier when you were telling me
that I reminded you of James Bond,

866
01:00:07,972 --> 01:00:11,964
and I was saying that it was the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me,

867
01:00:12,051 --> 01:00:13,087
I naturally assumed...

868
01:00:13,172 --> 01:00:16,243
You naturally assumed
you knew who I was talking about.

869
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:26,000
Because if you don't - if you weren't talking
about the guy I think that you're talking about,

870
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:30,843
well, you have me mistaken for somebody else,
because in my mind there is only one Bond.

871
01:00:31,768 --> 01:00:33,998
Well, on that we agree.

872
01:00:36,248 --> 01:00:37,522
Same time on three.

873
01:00:37,608 --> 01:00:39,245
- One...
- Two...

874
01:00:39,327 --> 01:00:41,079
- Three. George Lazenby.
- Roger Moore.

875
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:43,442
- George Lazenby?
- Roger Moore? I was kidding.

876
01:00:43,527 --> 01:00:45,005
- Yeah, I was kidding.
- You were?

877
01:00:45,086 --> 01:00:47,042
The only James Bond is...

878
01:00:47,126 --> 01:00:49,162
- Timothy Dalton.
- Pierce Brosnan.

879
01:00:52,285 --> 01:00:54,480
- Scotland forever.
- I feel so much better.

880
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,275
Why are you going?

881
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,915
I'm just going to get us some coffee.

882
01:01:31,919 --> 01:01:33,670
OK.

883
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:38,913
Hurry back to me.

884
01:01:39,678 --> 01:01:41,030
After Laughter

885
01:02:02,154 --> 01:02:04,110
Hey! Police.

886
01:02:04,194 --> 01:02:06,149
Aw, come on, man.

887
01:02:06,233 --> 01:02:08,701
I already talked to your buddy.

888
01:02:16,991 --> 01:02:19,346
Good morning. I'm Detective Dumbrowski.

889
01:02:19,431 --> 01:02:21,581
Good morning, Detective.
Am I being kidnapped?

890
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:24,662
Nope. We just want to have
a quick, friendly word with you.

891
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:28,264
Is this standard operating procedure
you'd find in the policeman's manual

892
01:02:28,349 --> 01:02:29,863
if you look up "quick, friendly word"?

893
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:32,543
There is no SOP for the box
you got yourself into.

894
01:02:32,629 --> 01:02:33,982
Oh.

895
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:41,066
- So what do you want to talk to me about?
- You.

896
01:02:41,148 --> 01:02:43,264
- What about me?
- Who are you?

897
01:02:43,347 --> 01:02:44,861
- Philosophically speaking?
- Name.

898
01:02:44,948 --> 01:02:47,415
- Rank, serial number...
- You should really play ball.

899
01:02:47,507 --> 01:02:49,462
You think I'm tall enough?

900
01:02:59,545 --> 01:03:03,059
- What is your name?
- Oh, yeah, I remember. Slevin Kelevra.

901
01:03:03,144 --> 01:03:05,374
K-E-L-E-V-R-A.

902
01:03:05,464 --> 01:03:08,182
<i>- Kelevra.
- Look, kid.</i>

903
01:03:08,263 --> 01:03:11,255
I don't know what's going on,
or how you're into this,

904
01:03:11,343 --> 01:03:13,810
but when I figure out what there is to figure out,

905
01:03:13,902 --> 01:03:15,733
I'm not gonna be so nice to you.

906
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:18,772
Oh, this is nice. Don't do me any favors.

907
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:22,017
<i>Last chance to come clean.</i>

908
01:03:28,581 --> 01:03:30,536
Take a walk.

909
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,497
I think this is the part
where you tell me not to walk too far.

910
01:04:44,568 --> 01:04:45,921
I have to go to work.

911
01:04:46,968 --> 01:04:48,923
Hey.

912
01:05:14,764 --> 01:05:17,721
- Hey, guys, what are you doing here?
- Now's the time.

913
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:21,037
I've got at least... Jesus.

914
01:05:21,122 --> 01:05:24,398
The Boss says he wants you to look nice
for The Fairy.

915
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:41,422
You're early.

916
01:06:44,309 --> 01:06:48,142
Why don't you come in and fix yourself a drink?
I was just getting ready.

917
01:06:59,587 --> 01:07:01,258
<i>You'll have to excuse the...</i>

918
01:07:01,346 --> 01:07:03,098
I wasn't expecting you for...

919
01:07:06,026 --> 01:07:07,778
<i>You look good.</i>

920
01:07:08,585 --> 01:07:10,894
<i>- You want some wine?
- No.</i>

921
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,941
Is something the matter?

922
01:07:16,584 --> 01:07:18,142
Somebody's trying to kill you.

923
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:21,855
Who?

924
01:07:24,783 --> 01:07:25,771
Me.

925
01:08:17,414 --> 01:08:19,769
- That was close.
- Yeah.

926
01:09:35,282 --> 01:09:36,318
Close.

927
01:10:56,469 --> 01:10:58,425
<i>I hired you to do a job.</i>

928
01:10:59,948 --> 01:11:01,984
It wasn't supposed to look like a job.

929
01:11:03,908 --> 01:11:08,902
So you take out the Israelis,
bomb the damn building...

930
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:13,943
and now the job
that was not supposed to look like a job's

931
01:11:14,027 --> 01:11:16,256
beginning to look very much

932
01:11:16,346 --> 01:11:18,302
like a job.

933
01:11:26,904 --> 01:11:28,860
All right. Fuck it.

934
01:11:31,384 --> 01:11:33,340
If the Rabbi wants a war...

935
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:36,691
...I'll give him a war.

936
01:11:43,702 --> 01:11:45,453
Saul.

937
01:11:48,061 --> 01:11:50,450
Saul.

938
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:53,095
<i>Saul, the phone's been...</i>

939
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:55,136
Oh.

940
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:57,176
I thought you were Saul.

941
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:02,009
People have been thinking I'm somebody else.

942
01:12:05,459 --> 01:12:07,893
Your predicament reminds me of a story.

943
01:12:07,978 --> 01:12:10,332
Hitchcock. North By Northwest.

944
01:12:11,178 --> 01:12:14,931
The movie where everybody thinks Cary Grant
is a man named George Kaplan,

945
01:12:15,017 --> 01:12:18,008
but the thing is there is no George Kaplan.
It's just a made-up name.

946
01:12:18,096 --> 01:12:20,451
But names, even made-up ones...

947
01:12:22,896 --> 01:12:25,125
...can bring about quite a bit of trouble.

948
01:12:27,055 --> 01:12:28,454
Now...

949
01:12:28,535 --> 01:12:30,684
the woman in the picture with Grant,

950
01:12:30,774 --> 01:12:33,129
<i>- her name was er...
- Eva Marie Saint.</i>

951
01:12:33,214 --> 01:12:35,967
- Oh... you know this movie.
- I know this movie.

952
01:12:36,054 --> 01:12:39,125
I took my father to see it in 1959.
His English wasn't very good,

953
01:12:39,213 --> 01:12:42,046
but boy, did he like Miss Saint.

954
01:12:42,132 --> 01:12:44,930
After the movie he turned to me and he said,
"She's a real Buick."

955
01:12:45,012 --> 01:12:48,401
You see, he couldn't pronounce
the word beauty, so he'd say Buick.

956
01:12:49,691 --> 01:12:53,444
- Caused quite a bit of confusion.
- Using the wrong name'll do that.

957
01:12:57,650 --> 01:12:59,481
Is that my money?

958
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:00,923
This is everything I owe you.

959
01:13:34,164 --> 01:13:37,952
It's the Sabbath. You see,
we don't answer the phone on the Sabbath.

960
01:13:38,044 --> 01:13:39,840
I know.

961
01:13:39,924 --> 01:13:41,720
Normally Saul turns off the ringer.

962
01:13:41,803 --> 01:13:42,952
Saul!

963
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:45,603
I tell you, you can't find good help these days.

964
01:13:49,442 --> 01:13:51,637
Saul's dead.

965
01:13:54,321 --> 01:13:55,549
<i>They're all dead.</i>

966
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:20,993
Oh, I've been in this room before.

967
01:14:23,437 --> 01:14:25,392
Looks the same as it did 20 years ago.

968
01:14:26,636 --> 01:14:28,591
Somehow...

969
01:14:29,436 --> 01:14:30,788
Somehow it seems different.

970
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:34,504
The way your car seems different
when someone else is driving it.

971
01:14:35,754 --> 01:14:38,791
Then again, it's been 20 years
since I've been in a car.

972
01:14:40,034 --> 01:14:43,071
Two decades spent behind three inches
of bulletproof glass

973
01:14:43,154 --> 01:14:47,749
due to a natural fear of high-powered rifles
and quiet... rooftops in New Jersey.

974
01:14:47,833 --> 01:14:49,788
20 years...

975
01:14:51,712 --> 01:14:54,987
...locked away in my own paranoia,
a prisoner in my own home.

976
01:14:57,391 --> 01:15:00,144
Only to be delivered to fate by a boy.

977
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:07,902
<i>Well, Anthony, it looks as though you've won.
If such a term may be applied.</i>

978
01:15:10,229 --> 01:15:12,504
<i>If I were wearing a hat, I would take it off.</i>

979
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:17,986
Should we get on with it, then?

980
01:15:24,267 --> 01:15:26,223
You can keep your hat on, Schlomo.

981
01:15:31,186 --> 01:15:34,462
Looks like we were sold a bill of goods
by the same salesman.

982
01:15:36,945 --> 01:15:38,900
Nice speech, though.

983
01:15:42,624 --> 01:15:44,854
I wish I was standing for it.

984
01:15:55,462 --> 01:15:57,611
You... you brought this upon our heads.

985
01:15:59,901 --> 01:16:03,860
- Me?
- You... you hired Goodkat to kill my son.

986
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:07,696
After you murdered my son?

987
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:12,173
- I had no hand in that.
- Oh, sure.

988
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:14,215
Just like in '84?

989
01:16:14,739 --> 01:16:18,174
I suppose you had no hand in that either.
Just a finger, maybe?

990
01:16:20,818 --> 01:16:22,774
Time's up, Rabbi.

991
01:16:24,337 --> 01:16:27,170
Lying to a dead man's
the same as lying to yourself.

992
01:16:31,017 --> 01:16:32,972
You were getting too big.

993
01:16:34,776 --> 01:16:36,732
See...

994
01:16:37,975 --> 01:16:40,011
...problem when two men are standing in a room

995
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:42,892
is you can only look at one of them
and they were looking at you

996
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:46,330
with their backs turned,
their shirt collars smiling at me.

997
01:16:48,893 --> 01:16:50,247
Then they called you The Boss.

998
01:16:53,213 --> 01:16:55,169
It was clear what had to be done.

999
01:17:01,412 --> 01:17:04,130
Try and appreciate how it feels, Schlomo...

1000
01:17:06,531 --> 01:17:10,284
...to wake up in the middle of the night
with six bullets burning in your stomach.

1001
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:13,359
Lying in a pool of your own blood and shit.

1002
01:17:17,569 --> 01:17:19,525
The dead eyes of...

1003
01:17:22,848 --> 01:17:25,362
...of your wife... staring back at you.

1004
01:17:29,007 --> 01:17:30,963
The only thing keeping you from passing out

1005
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:34,004
is the sound of the footsteps of the man
going down the hall...

1006
01:17:35,366 --> 01:17:37,322
...looking for your son.

1007
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:44,281
I managed to save my son, Schlomo.

1008
01:17:45,924 --> 01:17:47,880
And now...

1009
01:17:49,004 --> 01:17:51,039
...after all these years...

1010
01:17:52,883 --> 01:17:54,362
...in spite of our agreement!

1011
01:17:55,603 --> 01:17:57,161
You... you...

1012
01:17:57,243 --> 01:18:00,121
fucking backstabbing Philistine.

1013
01:18:01,002 --> 01:18:03,072
You managed to take my son away from me.

1014
01:18:04,561 --> 01:18:06,517
Well...

1015
01:18:07,721 --> 01:18:09,757
...now I've taken your son away from you.

1016
01:18:09,841 --> 01:18:12,752
I told you I had nothing to do with...

1017
01:18:21,559 --> 01:18:23,389
You haven't heard.

1018
01:18:23,478 --> 01:18:25,434
Will I?

1019
01:18:25,998 --> 01:18:29,546
Look at my face, Schlomo. Look at my smile.

1020
01:18:31,397 --> 01:18:33,035
Your son is dead.

1021
01:18:36,277 --> 01:18:38,346
Your son is dead.

1022
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:43,430
I'm gonna kill you. Hm.

1023
01:18:45,675 --> 01:18:46,744
<i>Rabbi.</i>

1024
01:18:47,994 --> 01:18:49,985
<i>Are you familiar with the Shmoo?</i>

1025
01:19:01,832 --> 01:19:03,788
Fisher.

1026
01:19:05,592 --> 01:19:07,547
Fisher, listen to me.

1027
01:19:10,272 --> 01:19:12,738
I already told you,

1028
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:14,786
I'm not Nick Fisher.

1029
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:21,866
Then who is Nick Fisher?

1030
01:19:28,108 --> 01:19:29,985
I think you mean, who was Nick Fisher?

1031
01:19:31,587 --> 01:19:33,384
Fisher was the answer to a question.

1032
01:19:33,467 --> 01:19:36,106
How do you get to two men
that can't be gotten to?

1033
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:45,702
<i>You get them to come to you.</i>

1034
01:19:53,384 --> 01:19:55,818
<i>But to do that... I needed a name.</i>

1035
01:19:56,624 --> 01:19:58,693
<i>And where do you find names?</i>

1036
01:19:58,783 --> 01:20:00,774
<i>In books.</i>

1037
01:20:04,983 --> 01:20:06,495
<i>And who has books?</i>

1038
01:20:14,261 --> 01:20:16,217
<i>Well, your bookies have books.</i>

1039
01:20:17,981 --> 01:20:19,095
He's clean.

1040
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:21,136
<i>Crooked bookies...</i>

1041
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:24,897
<i>- ... who work with big-time crooks.
- So... why are you here?</i>

1042
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:37,769
<i>I was looking for a gambler.</i>

1043
01:20:39,337 --> 01:20:41,009
<i>One who was in both books...</i>

1044
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:44,011
<i>... with a lot of red in the minus column.</i>

1045
01:20:44,096 --> 01:20:45,212
Got him.

1046
01:20:45,296 --> 01:20:47,251
<i>And that's when I found Nick Fisher.</i>

1047
01:20:47,856 --> 01:20:49,891
<i>A lowlife that no-one was gonna miss.</i>

1048
01:20:51,535 --> 01:20:52,853
1729.

1049
01:20:52,934 --> 01:20:55,084
Nick Fisher.

1050
01:20:55,174 --> 01:20:57,130
OK.

1051
01:21:08,372 --> 01:21:10,328
<i>There was a time.</i>

1052
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:28,883
All that was left to do was make the phone ring.

1053
01:21:48,606 --> 01:21:52,200
<i>All I had to do was pull the trigger
and wait for you to call the man</i>

1054
01:21:52,285 --> 01:21:54,515
<i>who does the jobs that no-one else wants.</i>

1055
01:21:56,565 --> 01:21:58,521
<i>I want an outsider brought in.</i>

1056
01:21:59,924 --> 01:22:02,040
There's a specialist.

1057
01:22:04,164 --> 01:22:06,154
Calls himself Mr. Goodkat.

1058
01:22:11,963 --> 01:22:13,918
Fine.

1059
01:22:15,562 --> 01:22:17,712
Tell him he can expect me in the morning.

1060
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,156
Are you ready?

1061
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,196
Yeah.

1062
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:31,116
It's just that one last thing.

1063
01:22:39,718 --> 01:22:41,070
<i>Mr. Goodkat.</i>

1064
01:22:42,038 --> 01:22:43,675
It's been a long time.

1065
01:22:47,837 --> 01:22:52,307
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr. Goodkat.
So I'll get right down to business.

1066
01:22:53,396 --> 01:22:57,104
Slim Hopkins, the man who ran my book,
was hit yesterday.

1067
01:22:58,755 --> 01:23:00,905
And I guess you've already heard about...

1068
01:23:02,354 --> 01:23:04,868
<i>- ... my son.
- Yes, I heard.</i>

1069
01:23:05,834 --> 01:23:07,585
I need you to sort it out for me.

1070
01:23:07,673 --> 01:23:09,311
Who's the mark?

1071
01:23:09,393 --> 01:23:10,906
Yitzchok.

1072
01:23:14,153 --> 01:23:15,710
Yitzchok, The Rabbi's son?

1073
01:23:15,792 --> 01:23:17,908
<i>You remember The Rabbi?</i>

1074
01:23:17,992 --> 01:23:19,744
I remember The Rabbi well.

1075
01:23:19,832 --> 01:23:21,389
<i>Thing is...</i>

1076
01:23:21,471 --> 01:23:23,905
it can't look like a job.

1077
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:27,224
<i>If Yitzchok gets hit, The Rabbi will go to war.</i>

1078
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:33,941
So... I need you to make it look like
it ain't what it is.

1079
01:23:35,429 --> 01:23:37,545
<i>Can that be done?</i>

1080
01:23:37,629 --> 01:23:39,540
Anything can be done.

1081
01:23:41,708 --> 01:23:43,983
Good. How?

1082
01:23:44,068 --> 01:23:46,137
Kansas City Shuffle.

1083
01:23:47,867 --> 01:23:49,744
I'm not familiar with the term.

1084
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:54,496
I'll need to see Slim's books.

1085
01:23:54,587 --> 01:23:59,943
Slim's books were taken when he was hit,
but... I do keep copies.

1086
01:24:04,504 --> 01:24:06,620
What are you looking for?

1087
01:24:09,943 --> 01:24:12,503
This is our guy. Nick - 1729.

1088
01:24:13,143 --> 01:24:15,179
1729.

1089
01:24:15,263 --> 01:24:16,616
Nick Fisher.

1090
01:24:16,703 --> 01:24:17,771
Why him?

1091
01:24:18,862 --> 01:24:20,454
A loser.

1092
01:24:20,542 --> 01:24:22,737
Pick him up. Bring him here.

1093
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,215
<i>Still not talking to each other, huh?</i>

1094
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:35,256
<i>Can't say that I blame you.</i>

1095
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:37,409
- Why are you here?
- Big job.

1096
01:24:37,499 --> 01:24:40,456
I was under the impression
you no longer worked New York.

1097
01:24:40,538 --> 01:24:43,576
Like I said... very big job.

1098
01:24:43,659 --> 01:24:47,697
And you thought, as long as you're in town,
you'd drop by and see your old pal Schlomo,

1099
01:24:47,778 --> 01:24:50,450
and say, "Hello. How about them Yanks?"

1100
01:24:52,737 --> 01:24:54,693
No. But something like that.

1101
01:24:58,696 --> 01:25:01,528
Only problem is you and I aren't old friends.

1102
01:25:01,615 --> 01:25:03,048
And I hate baseball.

1103
01:25:03,135 --> 01:25:06,286
And since we're not friends and
you hate baseball, why the fuck are you here?

1104
01:25:06,375 --> 01:25:09,127
It's because we're not friends that I'm here.

1105
01:25:10,014 --> 01:25:13,609
Because if we had been friends,
I wouldn't have been hired to kill your son.

1106
01:25:13,694 --> 01:25:18,243
Because that is right at the top of my list
of things that friends do not do to their friends.

1107
01:25:18,332 --> 01:25:21,450
The good news for you is,
my friendship is for sale.

1108
01:25:22,212 --> 01:25:25,443
You see, it seems to me
that your son means more to you alive

1109
01:25:25,532 --> 01:25:27,443
than he does to The Boss dead.

1110
01:25:27,532 --> 01:25:29,681
And more money means more to me
than less money.

1111
01:25:29,771 --> 01:25:33,729
And you are the guy that sleeps with
all that green under your mattress.

1112
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:36,043
I'm listening.

1113
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:40,042
You will pay me double to kill The Boss
what The Boss was paying me to kill Yitzchok.

1114
01:25:40,129 --> 01:25:43,201
- Ohh.
- And that...

1115
01:25:44,928 --> 01:25:46,884
And that will make us friends.

1116
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:49,604
Right, Rabbi?

1117
01:25:50,647 --> 01:25:51,967
Hm?

1118
01:25:55,927 --> 01:26:00,477
And... since friends do favors for their friends,
you will do a favor for me.

1119
01:26:00,566 --> 01:26:03,364
Pray tell? What is this favor?

1120
01:26:03,446 --> 01:26:06,835
Concerns a matter of debt collection.
One debt in particular.

1121
01:26:06,925 --> 01:26:08,040
Whose?

1122
01:26:08,125 --> 01:26:11,117
A flop. From Benny's book.
Goes by the name of Nick Fisher.

1123
01:26:11,204 --> 01:26:13,274
Who is he?

1124
01:26:13,364 --> 01:26:15,319
Just a loser.

1125
01:26:15,404 --> 01:26:17,359
You just made a lot of money.

1126
01:26:20,682 --> 01:26:23,755
<i>And then I was free
to come and go as I pleased.</i>

1127
01:26:37,121 --> 01:26:37,916
Hm?

1128
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,958
Whatever they're paying you...

1129
01:26:47,518 --> 01:26:48,872
Oh.

1130
01:26:49,758 --> 01:26:50,953
There is nobody.

1131
01:26:53,197 --> 01:26:55,153
I did this to you.

1132
01:26:58,037 --> 01:26:59,186
- Me.
- You.

1133
01:26:59,917 --> 01:27:01,635
Me.

1134
01:27:07,516 --> 01:27:09,471
Who are you?

1135
01:27:12,034 --> 01:27:13,945
<i>Who is he?</i>

1136
01:27:14,034 --> 01:27:18,186
Considering he no longer has fingerprints,
I'd say it's unlikely we'll ever know.

1137
01:27:18,274 --> 01:27:20,025
What about dental records?

1138
01:27:20,113 --> 01:27:25,470
Sure, find the bottom half of the jaw, then all
we need to do is find out who the dentist was.

1139
01:27:26,273 --> 01:27:28,228
What a fucking mess.

1140
01:27:29,552 --> 01:27:31,827
<i>Hey, Brikowski, it's Marty. You there?</i>

1141
01:27:31,912 --> 01:27:35,824
<i>We found two more bodies
to go along with the two you've already got.</i>

1142
01:27:35,911 --> 01:27:37,867
All right, I'll be right over.

1143
01:27:37,951 --> 01:27:42,103
Did you ever get a hold of The Rabbi so he can
get down here and identify what's left of his kid?

1144
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:45,421
<i>Negative.
We've been calling for the last hour, no answer.</i>

1145
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:46,942
Send somebody over.

1146
01:27:47,029 --> 01:27:48,178
<i>Copy.</i>

1147
01:27:50,108 --> 01:27:52,827
You all right? You look a little shook-up.

1148
01:27:52,909 --> 01:27:54,705
No, I'm fine.

1149
01:27:54,788 --> 01:27:56,744
All right.

1150
01:28:19,224 --> 01:28:22,295
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey, Brikowski, it's Murphy.</i>

1151
01:28:22,383 --> 01:28:23,896
Hey, Murph, what's up?

1152
01:28:23,983 --> 01:28:26,975
<i>Harry Kello came by today.
You remember Harry?</i>

1153
01:28:27,063 --> 01:28:30,772
He retired a few years ago. His wife just died,
so he comes in a couple of times a week,

1154
01:28:30,863 --> 01:28:32,818
talks shop, tells stories to the rooks.

1155
01:28:32,902 --> 01:28:36,451
Starts every sentence with, "The way
things used to be". Guy living in the past.

1156
01:28:36,542 --> 01:28:39,009
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, what about him?
- We're making small talk.</i>

1157
01:28:39,101 --> 01:28:42,571
Guy says he can't complain,
then all he does is fuckin' complain.

1158
01:28:42,661 --> 01:28:45,936
His dead wife, the leg he got shot in,
his crappy pension,

1159
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:49,568
but then he stops when he sees the picture
Marty snapped of your kid.

1160
01:28:49,659 --> 01:28:53,334
Just stares at it.
I say, "What is it? You know the kid?"

1161
01:28:53,419 --> 01:28:56,057
Thing is, he ain't looking at the picture,
but at the name.

1162
01:28:56,138 --> 01:28:59,414
I've got it written at the bottom.
He knows that name: Slevin.

1163
01:29:18,655 --> 01:29:20,611
I have that same phone.

1164
01:29:32,572 --> 01:29:36,770
<i>About an hour later the phone rings. It's Harry,
talking like a goddamned machine gun.</i>

1165
01:29:36,852 --> 01:29:39,241
Going on and on about a horse race back in '79.

1166
01:29:42,011 --> 01:29:43,967
<i>Aqueduct.</i>

1167
01:29:44,971 --> 01:29:47,121
Seven horse, tenth race - ring a bell?

1168
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:50,166
<i></i>

1169
01:29:54,569 --> 01:29:56,525
<i>It was a drug store handicap.</i>

1170
01:29:56,609 --> 01:30:00,487
<i>Big wind-up. Around the time The Boss,
The Rabbi set up shop in New York.</i>

1171
01:30:00,568 --> 01:30:03,480
<i>Before people started
waking up with knives in their backs.</i>

1172
01:30:03,568 --> 01:30:08,082
Anyway, he goes on about this local legend,
about this kid.

1173
01:30:08,166 --> 01:30:09,885
His name was Max.

1174
01:30:12,646 --> 01:30:16,274
<i>Max placed a bet with a bookie named Roth.</i>

1175
01:30:16,365 --> 01:30:18,515
Roth laid the bet off.

1176
01:30:18,605 --> 01:30:20,118
On you.

1177
01:30:29,203 --> 01:30:30,955
And you.

1178
01:30:37,562 --> 01:30:40,234
But when The Rabbi and The Boss
find out the fix is in,

1179
01:30:40,321 --> 01:30:42,277
they are the opposite of happy.

1180
01:30:42,361 --> 01:30:45,273
Word comes down an example is to be made.

1181
01:30:45,361 --> 01:30:46,110
Aargh!

1182
01:30:46,201 --> 01:30:48,430
These guys kill everyone!

1183
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:49,714
<i>And I mean everyone.</i>

1184
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:53,910
<i>Max, his wife, his kid, Roth...</i>

1185
01:30:53,999 --> 01:30:55,830
<i>even the goddamned horse died.</i>

1186
01:30:55,919 --> 01:30:59,388
These guys went to town with a tomahawk.
It was a fucking massacre.

1187
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:05,076
<i>They had to bring in a specialist to do the kid
cos nobody would take the job.</i>

1188
01:31:22,275 --> 01:31:24,470
What have you done with my son?

1189
01:31:40,112 --> 01:31:41,784
You?

1190
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:43,863
No.

1191
01:31:43,952 --> 01:31:46,147
You're dead.

1192
01:31:47,631 --> 01:31:49,940
You're dead!

1193
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:59,948
<i>So Harry's going on about how they had to
bring in a specialist to kill the kid.</i>

1194
01:32:00,029 --> 01:32:04,067
But I ain't seeing the connection,
so I says, "What has this to do with the case?"

1195
01:32:04,148 --> 01:32:06,104
<i>He says. "The horse's name."</i>

1196
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:08,224
<i>I say. "What about the horse's name?"</i>

1197
01:32:08,308 --> 01:32:12,539
<i>He says the horse's name was
Lucky Number Slevin.</i>

1198
01:32:12,627 --> 01:32:14,538
- What is your name?
- Slevin Kelevra.

1199
01:32:23,385 --> 01:32:25,341
Do you remember this part?

1200
01:32:35,664 --> 01:32:38,541
Please! I have a family.

1201
01:32:38,623 --> 01:32:40,454
Not any more, you don't.

1202
01:32:40,543 --> 01:32:42,260
Henry!

1203
01:32:44,262 --> 01:32:46,218
You fucking bastards!

1204
01:32:47,861 --> 01:32:50,375
You fucking bastards!

1205
01:33:08,938 --> 01:33:11,406
The two of you killed everything I ever loved.

1206
01:33:17,417 --> 01:33:19,373
Fuck you both.

1207
01:33:42,813 --> 01:33:47,603
<i>Now, there is no such person as Slevin Kelevra.
As far as I can tell.</i>

1208
01:33:47,693 --> 01:33:49,841
<i>Which means the kid was using a pseudonym.</i>

1209
01:33:49,931 --> 01:33:52,843
<i>Which is interesting.
Him picking the name of a dead racehorse</i>

1210
01:33:52,931 --> 01:33:55,161
and keeping company
with The Boss and The Rabbi,

1211
01:33:55,251 --> 01:33:58,367
seeing as they had some involvement
with that very horse.

1212
01:33:58,451 --> 01:34:01,010
<i>I thought to myself, maybe it means something.</i>

1213
01:34:01,089 --> 01:34:05,765
<i>Then again, maybe it's just a coincidence.
Name's gotta come from someplace - right?</i>

1214
01:34:05,849 --> 01:34:09,398
<i>I guess none of this really matters
now that the kid's gone cold.</i>

1215
01:34:14,208 --> 01:34:17,244
<i>Ah, one more thing.
We've got a new guy in the precinct.</i>

1216
01:34:17,968 --> 01:34:20,401
<i>Jewish fella, funny little guy. Talks a lot.</i>

1217
01:34:21,847 --> 01:34:26,601
<i>Anyway, in case you're interested,
he says the name Kelevra is Hebrew.</i>

1218
01:34:26,686 --> 01:34:28,802
<i>He says it means...</i>

1219
01:34:28,886 --> 01:34:30,841
Bad dog.

1220
01:34:37,124 --> 01:34:39,684
<i>20 years ago, he used to be my bookie.</i>

1221
01:34:39,764 --> 01:34:41,834
<i>I used to sign my pay cheques over to him.</i>

1222
01:34:57,361 --> 01:34:59,317
Brikowski? You there?

1223
01:36:49,144 --> 01:36:50,861
<i>Your girl made me.</i>

1224
01:36:52,583 --> 01:36:54,539
She took my picture.

1225
01:36:55,462 --> 01:36:57,418
She's got to go in the ground.

1226
01:36:59,661 --> 01:37:00,617
OK.

1227
01:37:21,298 --> 01:37:23,254
I have something I have to tell you.

1228
01:37:25,817 --> 01:37:27,773
He told me that we needed to kill you.

1229
01:37:32,937 --> 01:37:34,892
You're gonna have to trust me.

1230
01:37:45,895 --> 01:37:47,850
Shit!

1231
01:37:50,653 --> 01:37:52,609
He's going to shoot you here.

1232
01:38:47,764 --> 01:38:49,720
I didn't think you'd understand.

1233
01:39:06,641 --> 01:39:08,199
I understood.

1234
01:39:12,841 --> 01:39:14,796
How did you find out about us?

1235
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,030
I'm a world-class assassin, fuckhead.

1236
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,076
How do you think I found out?

1237
01:39:22,599 --> 01:39:24,430
I thought you might want this.

1238
01:40:02,633 --> 01:40:04,385
I want to go home.

1239
01:40:04,473 --> 01:40:06,748
