00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,442
(Music)

3
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,210
Thank you.
You're welcome.

4
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,969
Oh, my!

5
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,930
Mrs Jones, Rosemary Jones?

6
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,050
Rosie, please, I prefer Rosie.

7
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,084
Is everything alright?
Yes, fine..

8
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,530
I was just checking the...

9
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,567
trunk, the big leather trunk.
Is that yours?

10
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,206
Yes, that's mine.

11
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,610
Good, thank you. Good.

12
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,969
Mrs Jones?

13
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,090
Good morning, officers.

14
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,924
Two dismembered bodies, Rosemary.

15
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,447
Why don't you just tell me Who they are?

16
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,641
My husband and his mistress.
They were planning to run away together.

17
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,887
So you thought
you'd just kill them instead.

18
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,811
Well, I couldn't very well
stand idly by, could I?

19
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,251
Rosemary Jones, you've been found guilty
for the crime of manslaughter.

20
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,925
Manslaughter! And at the time
you committed these acts,

21
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,605
you were suffering from such an
abnormality of mind,

22
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,162
that it seriously impaired
your responsibility.

23
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,363
I therefore make an order
for your detention...

24
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,007
in a secure unit
for the criminally insane.

25
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,362
Not to be free,

26
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,247
until such time as the home secretary
decides that your continued detention...

27
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,285
is no longer necessary
for the protection of the public.

28
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,762
I don't suppose there's any chance
for a cup of tea, is there?

29
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,602
(children chattering)

30
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,005
Thank you very much for coming.
Very nice to see you again.

31
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,289
Goodbye Mrs Martin.
Marvellous sermon, Vicar.

32
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,448
Very kind, thank you.

33
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,371
Thank you, Reverend Goodfellow.
You're very welcome, Mrs Parker.

34
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,362
I just wanted to have a word with you
about the ﬂower arranging committee.

35
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,925
Oh, ah, yes of course. Perhaps...
This afternoon.

36
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,924
Mrs Goodfellow is not with you again?

37
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,768
Oh no, no. Sorry about that.
She's been very busy. Mrs Parker.

38
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,406
Next week perhaps?
Perhaps, yes.

39
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,171
Although,
she is incredibly busy at the moment.

40
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,844
Oh!

41
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,770
For fuck's sake. Jesus Christ!

42
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,084
What's a girl got to do to get
a decent nights sleep around here?

43
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,609
Holly!

44
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,565
Don't forget about Tuesday.
Oh sorry, it's Tuesday.

45
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,769
Oh, Petey.

46
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,204
Fuck off.
Holly, it's time to wake up.

47
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,849
Holly...

48
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,761
Holly, I know you're in there,
would you please come out, right away!

49
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,406
Mother!
I don't think you want me to do that.

50
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,444
I think you'll find I bloody well do.

51
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,764
Is that you, Carl?
(Holly) No, this is Mark.

52
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,804
(Mark)
Nice to meet you, Mrs Goodfellow.

53
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,761
Holly, this is totally unacceptable.
I'm 17, it's been legal for a year.

54
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,565
Legal does not make it decent.

55
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,604
Is everything alright, Mrs Goodfellow?

56
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,331
Yes, everything is fine, Mrs Parker.

57
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,364
Is that Holly I heard?
Holly? No.

58
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,050
Oh. Morning, Mrs Parker.

59
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,969
Morning.

60
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,120
You know the thing that pains me the most?
No. But you'll tell me anyway.

61
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,130
You're an intelligent girl.
An intelligent girl who's got a libido.

62
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,165
An intelligent girl knows
what to do with it. - I know it.

63
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,249
Oh, Holly.

64
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,847
We used to be such friends.
(Vicar) Hello.

65
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,490
Now you cross with me all the time.
Because you are a total and utter bitch.

66
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,525
Ah, look at you two. Morning, sweetheart.
Morning.

67
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,844
It's sort of as we feared, the pond.

68
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,204
I've been chatting with the chaps
at the Water Board. Looks like it's algae.

69
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,608
It could be one of two
or three different types apparently.

70
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,248
Some of them poisonous.
They're worried about the water-table.

71
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,402
Anyway, they say it will get worse
if it's not dealt with.

72
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,603
A lot of things will get worse
if they're not dealt with.

73
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,964
They'll come back to me with the details.
The devil's in the details, Dad.

74
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,004
Could we not say that word on a Sunday.

75
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,684
Dad!

76
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,964
Al right.
Where are you going now

77
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,926
I've got work to do.
You've just been to work.

78
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,009
I've got to write a speech
for that convention,

79
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,441
God's mysterious ways,

80
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,371
and that's all I've got to show for it,
a title.

81
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,400
See, you're an utter bitch to him.
No, I'm not.

82
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,683
And I know why, you're not getting any.
What?

83
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,326
The same reason
you're angry with me and Mark.

84
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,682
Oh, in the van, in front of the house,
on a Sunday.

85
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,725
That might have more to do with it.
I don't think so.

86
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,371
Oh, you must be right then.
Well, I usually am.

87
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,646
Can I get you any?

88
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,810
Petey, how long have you been there?
Holly says you're not getting any.

89
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,845
Can I get you some?
Oh Petey, that's very thoughtful,

90
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,524
but no, you can't.

91
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,607
Let's face it. I'm no good at this.
No, you just need a little tweaking,

92
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,645
a little Lance adjustment,
but that's another story.

93
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,201
Al right now, Gloria.

94
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,087
I told you that the key is in the swing.
Well, I never had a good swing.

95
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,727
I disagree.
I bet you could swing really well.

96
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,647
Now, you grip that shaft,
gently but firmly.

97
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,647
Now, spread your legs. A little more.
Oh.

98
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,044
Now you bend to the ball slowly.

99
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,330
Yeah. Now, bend your knees.

100
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,764
Yeah.

101
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,690
Feel good?
Yes, feels fine.

102
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,484
Okay.

103
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,568
Now you just keep your eye on the ball.
Okay.

104
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,207
You let me worry about the hole.
Right.

105
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,649
That's quite good.
Well, your ball is in the rough,

106
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,684
but it's a good feeling, huh?
Yeah.

107
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,929
One more?

108
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,361
Okay.

109
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,970
Mrs Parker asked after you again
this morning. - Surprise, surprise.

110
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,050
I think I'm beginning to run out excuses.
Well, then don't make any.

111
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,801
You know what you can do, you can go down
and kill that bloody dog,

112
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,844
and I'll put in a month of Sundays.

113
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,405
Was that a brassier
over Holly's shoulder this morning?

114
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,045
You're a half day behind the rest of us,
you know that?

115
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,490
We call it a bra nowadays.

116
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,204
Why did she have it over her shoulder?

117
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,730
She was doing the laundry.

118
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,242
(Dog barking)

119
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,569
Mr Brown?

120
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,411
Mr Brown, it's Mrs Goodfellow,
about Clarence, it's about your dog.

121
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,290
You woke me.
Yes, well, your dog woke me.

122
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,927
What did you say?
I said your dog woke me.

123
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,289
Well, he's found his voice.
Yes, he has, hasn't he?

124
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,282
I was wondering whether we could perhaps
keep him inside just the night-time.

125
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,803
Got your sandwiches and sports bag?
(Petey) Yes. Yes!

126
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,049
Daddy is picking you up this afternoon.
But Daddy forgets.

127
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,291
No! And tomorrow it's a new housekeeper,
and she's paid not to forget.

128
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,286
I thought you were going to be brave
and take the bus this year. - Next year.

129
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,531
No, you said that last year.
Come on, you're going to have a good time.

130
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,410
See you around, Goodfellow.

131
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,770
My shoelace is undone.

132
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,128
Tell me about when you were a girl.
Oh Petey, you know already.

133
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,568
Al right then.

134
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,491
When I was a girl,
I lived in a big scary house.

135
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,366
With the black women.
No, they wore black, they were nuns.

136
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,290
Mostly Irish, and mostly evil.

137
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,804
And you were there because you were awful.
No, I was an orphan. Orphan, darling.

138
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,731
Come on, off you go have a good day.
Remember to make Daddy remember.

139
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,569
Promise.

140
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,809
Oh, she's here already? The housekeeper.

141
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,845
No, no, just her trunk.
It arrived while you were out.

142
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,285
It's a lovely old thing. Isn't it?
Well, well, well.

143
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,246
Look at that. Grace.

144
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,560
Is it a sign, do you think?
No, I think it's a trunk.

145
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,208
In the books I read when I was a boy
there was always a trunk just like this,

146
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,131
full of treasure.
You will remember to pick up Pete?

147
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,165
I can't this afternoon.
Al right. I'll write it down.

148
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,761
I've got to take Mrs Applebee
to the garden centre.

149
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,041
Now, where's the pen? The Pen?

150
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,966
Oh, look at this.

151
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,644
You've made it really nice up here.
Grace should be very happy.

152
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,686
You know, Lilian and Brian have made love
in every single room in their house.

153
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,525
Their house is smaller.
Yes, but they went around twice.

154
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,365
I'm late for work already.
So, what's half an hour?

155
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,405
You take this off, and you're just
a man, Walter Goodfellow.

156
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,120
Don't forget Petey, now.

157
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,164
Oh, Lord, yes.
I think I wrote it down.

158
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,844
Ye

159
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,042
(chattering)

160
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,489
Hello!

161
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,809
Petey!

162
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,249
Petey?

163
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,441
Walter?

164
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:10,291
Hi, Darling. We're just talking
about the Algae and... - Where's Petey?

165
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,290
Oh Lord. I'm sorry. Mrs Hallyway rang me
about her crisis of faith.

166
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,928
She was on the verge of losing it.
I know the bloody feeling.

167
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,969
Let's get him.
No, this is really unnecessary.

168
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,970
Should I push him?
Do you want to be pushed? - No, please.

169
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,607
I'm going to count to three. Three.
No!

170
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,802
See you in the morning.
(boys laughing)

171
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,924
Oh, deary, deary me. Look at you.

172
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,520
Give me a hand. Let me help you up.
You look so uncomfortable.

173
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,210
No one has a clue where he is.
I don't understand.

174
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,806
(Gloria) There he is!

175
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,530
Who the bloody hell is that?

176
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,284
Hey, what are you doing with my son?

177
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,644
Come here, come on. Quick.
Oh.

178
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,644
You must be Gloria.
Get in the car.

179
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,371
Look, I think,
there might be a misunderstanding.

180
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,127
You bet your life
there's a misunderstanding.

181
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,527
Grace Hawkins.

182
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,040
You're Grace Hawkins.
Yes.

183
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,005
Mrs Hawkins, welcome to Little Wallop.
Thank you, Vicar.

184
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,125
I'm sorry about earlier, Mrs Hawkins.
Oh, no. Not at all.

185
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,642
Under the circumstances
you did just the right thing.

186
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,844
I could have been anybody,
and please call me Grace. - Reverend!

187
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,807
Ah, Mrs Parker, may I introduce you
to our new housekeeper, Grace Hawkins.

188
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,880
Mrs Parker is chairman... chair of the
St. Michael's Flower Arranging Committee.

189
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,289
Which I wanted to talk to you about.
We will talk about it, we really will,

190
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,609
but Grace has literally just arrived,
and I was wondering... - The tricks...

191
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,725
We'd better go in. They'll be forever.
Are quite unbelievable.

192
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,242
In my whole experience
in 43 years on this committee

193
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,284
I'm well aware of this problem.

194
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,088
Oh, this is just...

195
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,847
He's a persistent little fellow, isn't he?
It's not what I call him.

196
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,569
I've given it a good airing,
but it's still a little bit musty.

197
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,206
Oh no, it's perfect.

198
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,644
It's just as I imagined it.
A perfect home for a perfect family.

199
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,005
Well, let's hope they make us an offer.
A sense of humour.

200
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,762
I like that.
Good, because you're going to need one.

201
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,406
There you go again.

202
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,767
How are we going to get that upstairs?
Oh, we'll find a way.

203
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,805
What do you think is in it?
I don't know and I didn't ask.

204
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,686
Holly!
I just want to know what's in it.

205
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,326
Memories, dear.

206
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,090
A life time of memories.

207
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,646
And a few clothes.

208
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,324
You must be Holly. My, you are tall.

209
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,489
You must get that from your father's side.

210
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,410
Oh, this is David.
Hi.

211
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,565
Oh!

212
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,289
The women in this family certainly share
a taste for good looking fellows.

213
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,487
Holly, are you taking the weight?
This way.

214
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,247
A sharp left, darling.
Watch it, watch it.

215
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,887
Sorry, sorry.
Now this door's very narrow.

216
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,527
Slowly down. Watch your fingers.
That's fine.

217
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,570
Well now, I don't think the occasion
should go by without a few words.

218
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,604
Walter.
Just a few words, Gloria.

219
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,690
Lord, thank you for this day.

220
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,204
And thank you for bringing us Grace,

221
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,491
who joined our family today and who
we hope will be very happy here.

222
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,010
And thank you also for Carl...

223
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,001
Mark...
David.

224
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,530
David,

225
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,564
Who we've also only just met, actually,

226
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,284
but Who seems to be a very... ah...

227
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,330
nice young man indeed.
Amen.

228
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,491
Al right, Who would like a cup of tea?
Yeah, we'd better get going.

229
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,367
Thank you for that, Walter. Vicar, sir.
Oh, you're very welcome, Grace.

230
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,404
I meant every word.
Thank you.

231
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,362
(Music)

232
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,084
(Lance)
God, you drive me crazy.

233
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,886
Oh God.
No...

234
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,126
No, stop, stop!

235
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,802
Okay, I know where we could drive.
That's five minutes away. - Not the shed.

236
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,650
You know it?
Of course I know it!

237
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,401
I'm the Vicar's wife, Lance.
I'd have to drive half a day...

238
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,330
before I'm not recognized.
So let's stay.

239
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,603
You want our first time to be in a car.
Honey, I just want our first time.

240
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,802
I'm not doing it in a car.

241
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,765
Women in my age don't do it in cars.
That's the sort of thing my daughter does.

242
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,805
She does? No, I hear you.
There's a time and a place, Lance.

243
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,844
Like Mexico.
Exactly, like Mexico.

244
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,170
Which is exactly Where we are going to be.
When?

245
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,248
Soon, I promise.

246
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,762
I just want a break.
I just need a break.

247
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,407
Just a couple of weeks.
We'll be there in a heartbeat, baby.

248
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,444
Naked and living of the fruits of love.

249
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,886
Warm sun.
Tequila.

250
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,649
Hot salsa.

251
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,886
Would that be the music or the food.
I think, a bit of both.

252
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,922
(honking) Ah!

253
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,489
Good night then.
A little good night kiss.

254
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,128
Are you crazy? They're all watching.
That's Mrs Parker! - Who?

255
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,845
Oh, come on. She probably...
She probably can't even see.

256
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,967
Just pretend you're a taxi and go.
Go on.

257
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,007
I'll call you.
What the hell am I doing?

258
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,084
I hope you know because I have no clue.

259
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,126
Wow! Oh my Lord.

260
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,450
So you must be Holly.

261
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,805
See you next time sweetie.

262
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,482
(Dog barking)

263
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,126
Jesus Christ.

264
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,367
Can't we have some good old fashioned rock
to smite that little fucker dead.

265
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,007
Then I might start listening to you again.

266
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,165
I'm sorry, did I startle you?
No, no. Ls everything okay?

267
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,245
Oh yes. I just wanted to thank you.
Thank you very much.

268
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,445
No, not at all. It's me
who should be thanking you, really.

269
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,564
Well, good night, dear.
Good night.

270
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,407
You know, my father was a minister.
Really?

271
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,565
That's a coincidence.
So, I know their little ways.

272
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,566
Well I think you'll find
Walter is quite set in his.

273
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,208
You just leave him to me, dear.
Why couldn't I just do that.

274
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,483
Should I close the door?
That would be lovely.

275
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,410
Good night, dear.
Good night.

276
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,522
(Dog barking)

277
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,809
Al right.

278
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,281
Oh!

279
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,202
(Dog barking)

280
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,562
(Dog yowling)

281
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,126
(Brown) Clarence!

282
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,762
Clarence?
(Whistles)

283
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,488
Where's that bloody dog?

284
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,206
Wakey, wakey.

285
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,130
I thought you deserved a lie-in.

286
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,164
Breakfast is ready when you are.

287
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,251
Oh, I slept straight through.
Makes a change.

288
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,651
Fantastic.

289
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,091
Grace, this is absolutely fantastic.
Thank you, Vicar. Here's a toast, dear.

290
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,682
Breakfast is the most important meal
of the day, did you know that, Holly?

291
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,724
I vaguely remember Mom
failing to drum that into me.

292
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,444
Good morning.

293
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,610
As it's such a big day for you, Vicar,
I've given you extra.

294
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,805
It's only a bit of fun, Grace.
Oh, can't I talk you out of it.

295
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,251
No.

296
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,285
It's going to be the most embarrassing day
of my life, again.

297
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,888
It's all in a good cause.
That doesn't make it less embarrassing.

298
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,925
I think it could be fun.
She's new, she'll learn.

299
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,646
Chin up, chin up.
I just need to warm up a bit, I think.

300
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,570
Bad luck Vicar.
Oh dear.

301
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,044
No, I just can't watch.
Oh, Holly.

302
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,131
Why hang around just to see him humiliate
himself in front of the Whole village?

303
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,767
As if I don't get enough of that
every Sunday.

304
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,847
He's a handsome fellow, isn't he?
What?

305
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,247
Your husband.

306
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,089
Come on!

307
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,730
Cuts quite an athletic figure.

308
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,610
I'll be back in a minute.

309
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,842
Let's cheer for your father, shall we,
perhaps that'll help. - Come on, Dad.

310
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,486
Come on, Vicar.
Hi.

311
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,170
Perhaps next time.
I'm sorry.

312
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,290
I was waving. Oh dear.

313
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,322
Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry about that.
Come on, Vicar.

314
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,250
Pray for guidance, Vicar.

315
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,370
That was only just in.

316
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,249
Sorry.

317
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,929
Sorry.

318
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,922
You alright, Vicar?
Oh, I'm fine.

319
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,123
I'm just winded. I think I'm fine.
No, no.

320
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,165
I promise you. I'm sure I can carry on.
Take a breather.

321
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,241
Come on.
You okay, Dad?

322
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,285
Yes, I'm fine. - Hard luck, Vic.
Oh, thank you, Grace. I did my best.

323
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,485
Would you like a nice hot cup of tea?
That sounds wonderful, Grace.

324
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,525
Come on, let's get your father some tea.
Thank you.

325
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,966
To me, to me!

326
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,405
That was bad luck out there, Reverend.
Thank you.

327
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:56,004
Well, I guess these things happen?
Yes, they certainly do. They just did.

328
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,048
I went for the ball, Ref.

329
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,084
Well, I got to hand it to you,
Walter,

330
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,125
you sure took it like a man,
I'll say that for you.

331
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,647
I'm sorry, I... Have we...
Oh, sorry, Lance.

332
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,486
I see your wife.

333
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,326
I'm her golf pro.
Oh yes.

334
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,364
She takes her golf very seriously.

335
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,924
Yeah, always comes on time, too.

336
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,281
Oh yes, she's very good like that.
Very good.

337
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,089
Well...

338
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,285
Nice to meet you, Walter.
Nice to meet you, Lance.

339
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,962
Are you trying to make this
as awkward as possible?

340
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,607
We were just two guys shooting the breeze.

341
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,051
Nothing to worry about.
Besides, you can't blame a man...

342
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,769
for wanting to check out his competition.
Yeah, but that's my husband.

343
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,201
<i>So, guess what</i>

344
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,211
I talked to my travel guide last night.
Really? And what did he say?

345
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,244
When are we leaving?
It's all good.

346
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,806
Here you go, Petey.

347
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,723
I'll drive so I can show you the way,
then you can drive. - I can't.

348
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,765
No, it's alright you're on my insurance.
No, I can't drive.

349
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,491
Well, it's never to late to learn.
Good morning.

350
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,924
Hi, you haven't seen Clarence, have you?
No, I'm afraid not.

351
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,567
It's not like him,
it's not like him at all.

352
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:26,404
Oh, dear. Never mind, the best night's
sleep I've had in a long-time.

353
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,164
Every cloud has a silver lining.

354
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,089
Clarence!

355
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,047
You little bugger, where are you?
Clarence!

356
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,650
Get out of the way! Move!

357
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,483
I've got to order a new track suit.
Would you like me to come in with you?

358
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,410
Is that a good idea?
Yeah.

359
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,882
(Handy ringing)

360
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,891
(Lance) So in Mexico
they have these endless miles...

361
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,049
of perfect glistening white sand beaches.

362
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,051
And what we're going to do,
for the rest of our lives,

363
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,404
is to find our own little stretch,
our own little private place,

364
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,046
just you and me.

365
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,165
And then what I going to do,

366
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,808
is, I am going to cover your body
with coconut cream every day,

367
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,844
and I am going to start at your toes,

368
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,523
and I going to lick my way up slowly
all the way to your little...

369
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,564
Well, that sounds lovely.
When do we go?

370
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,921
Fuck!

371
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,447
How was he? - Oh, petrified.
Oh, poor Petey.

372
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,322
(Handy ringing)

373
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,929
Hello?

374
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,084
Hello, Lilian. I can't really talk
right now, can I call you back, later?

375
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,124
(Lance) I found the perfect spot.
Bye.

376
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,207
Yes, that was Lilian,
an old friend of mine.

377
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,209
Clarence!

378
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,169
Clarence!

379
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,530
Clarence, where are you?

380
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,209
And then once we broke into the boy's
college in the middle of the night,

381
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,767
me and some friends and did
a striptease for the lads.

382
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,408
It wasn't any old college either,
it was religion and philosophy.

383
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,565
Is that where you met Walter?
That's where I met Walter.

384
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,125
He was post-grad and I was a first year,
and he was...

385
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,164
He was just different from the others.

386
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,604
Still is. Not many like him around.

387
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,649
Put your finger on here, will you?
But why is it,

388
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,891
when they eventually do find God,
that they lose their sense of humour?

389
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,046
(Handy ringing) Oh.

390
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,449
Hello?

391
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,286
Lilian, again.

392
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,006
Where are you?

393
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,882
(Music)

394
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,605
That was Lilian and I'm going for a nip
into town and meet her for lunch.

395
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,449
Lilian?

396
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,691
I'd so like to meet her.
Yes, of course! Uhm...

397
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,330
I'll sort something out.

398
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,850
Byebye.
Bye.

399
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,807
Gods ways are mysterious
that's why we say:

400
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,686
God's mysterious ways.

401
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,328
I mean, look at Job and all
that befell him. He asks the Lord:

402
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,524
"Why are you doing all of this to me?"

403
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,650
And God could have explained,

404
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,367
but instead he just said:
"Trust me, Job."

405
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,050
Now that's mysterious.

406
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,324
God?

407
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,246
Yes, Walter?

408
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,804
How do you think it's sounding?

409
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,484
Well, the title stinks, for a start.

410
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,486
Hi, I'm sorry.
I can't agree with God about that.

411
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,524
Goodness, Grace.
Hope you don't mind.

412
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,605
No, no, no, I was just practising
for the convention.

413
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,570
It's very thought provoking.

414
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,930
Dry and boring, I think, you mean.

415
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,964
But that's me all over.
Nonsense.

416
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,728
I'm not the most vibrant of individuals.

417
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,650
A bit serious, perhaps.

418
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,085
You've hit the nail on the head there.
Reverend Goodfellow!

419
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,205
Reverend Goodfellow! I just wanted
to speak to you about...

420
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,410
Mrs Hawkins.
Mrs Parker.

421
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,171
Is it possible to have a word with you,
privately?

422
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,367
It's about
the ﬂower arranging committee.

423
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,769
It has taken a turn for the worse.
I have never in all my life,

424
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,804
I have never, never...
Mrs Parker,

425
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,004
the Reverend is practising his sermon.

426
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,764
Ah, yes,
I have a convention coming up.

427
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,529
I see.

428
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,089
Very well.

429
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,046
Goodbye, Mrs Parker.

430
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,571
Oh, dear. I hope that didn't...
Of course not.

431
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,408
For goodness sake, you are a busy man,
Vicar, people should realize that.

432
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,249
Right.

433
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,164
Yes.

434
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,044
Now.

435
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,966
About your sermon.

436
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,444
Yes?

437
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,926
Do you like jokes?

438
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,327
Jokes?

439
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,362
(Music)

440
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,725
So you see, God is very tired
and he say to St. Peter:

441
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,964
"“Look, Peter... Petey," he says,

442
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,125
“I'm absolutely exhausted.
I need a holiday, I really do.

443
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,684
Is there anywhere you can suggest?
So,

444
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,290
"St. Peter thinks for a bit,
and then he says: “Well I know,"

445
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,324
he says, 'what about the moon?

446
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,327
And God said: "No, I don't think so.
Not the moon, there's no atmosphere.“."

447
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,164
Yeah, that's funny.
I'm not finished, yet. So then God says:

448
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,967
"I really want something different." So,
St. Peter says: "Well, what about Earth?"

449
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,891
And God says:
"No, I went there 2000 years ago.

450
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:19,649
I met this nice little Jewish girl,
and they're still talking about it."

451
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,682
(Music)

452
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,046
I did good, huh?

453
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,766
You look beautiful.

454
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,569
After you.

455
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,931
Fabulous, right?
Oh yes!

456
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,850
The tickets are on their way.

457
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,206
Baby! Oh, baby!

458
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,801
Oh, this is it! Oh God.

459
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,320
I need...
Wait!

460
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,364
What?
Let me take my clothes off.

461
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,524
Okay.

462
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,850
Oh, man. Oh, God almighty!

463
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,526
Slow, slow, slow.

464
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,487
Oh, yeah! Oh, God almighty.
You make me crazy.

465
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,081
Oh God, what's that?
What?

466
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,724
That.

467
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,047
This is my love thing.
I know what it is.

468
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,482
I thought you Brits
like this kind of thing. - No.

469
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,410
You do not think this is hot?

470
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,324
No.

471
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,522
(Handy ringing)

472
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,564
You didn't turn your phone off.

473
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,289
Hello?

474
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,924
What?

475
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,610
Who the hell's this? Oh.

476
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,924
A girl.
I don't know any girls.

477
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,131
I got it, I'll just take it off.
No, keep it on.

478
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,563
In fact you could put everything back on.
I think we had quite enough for today.

479
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,369
Good Lord.

480
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,326
"Giggle mm God".

481
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,849
Oh no.

482
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,490
Is everything alright, Vicar?

483
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,770
It's just so quiet, Grace.

484
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,846
Lovely, isn't it?

485
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,204
Have a good afternoon.
And you.

486
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,682
(Laughing)

487
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,091
Very good.

488
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,762
(Music)

489
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,647
ls your dad going to make
you pray tonight?

490
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,971
Shut up.
Does he make you pray to baby Jesus?

491
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:39,611
Just leave me alone.
Run to granny, you prat.

492
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,810
Are you alright?
Yeah.

493
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,162
(Unintelligible)

494
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,247
You know, I was wondering, if you had
a magic word, what word would it be?

495
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,205
I mean, what's your favourite word?
My favourite word?

496
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,846
Broccoli.
Broccoli?

497
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,490
Well, I don't know. Why not?

498
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,242
(Boys yelling)

499
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,724
It's alright, Petey, it's alright.

500
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,487
You just close your eyes.
Keep them closed.

501
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,530
Now say the magic word.

502
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,449
Broccoli.

503
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,086
Now open them.

504
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,086
See what happens.

505
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,287
(Boy) Look, there's God boy.
It's alright.

506
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,324
You're dead, God boy, you're dead!

507
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,567
My breaks aren't working!
I can't stop!

508
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,002
(Boys screaming)

509
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,764
Who's that?
He's Billy Martin.

510
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,485
(Grace) Wow! Good old Broccoli.
Shall we have some for supper?

511
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,529
Hi, Mom.

512
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,364
You know, ﬂour can be so sensual.

513
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:40,009
In Heaven it took me 3 months to find
a priest up here for the wedding.

514
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:44,090
How long do you think it would take me
to find a lawyer? - Yeah, I like that.

515
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,329
Oh, Gloria, you're back.
This is Mark... ah...

516
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,250
David... ah...
Grant.

517
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,771
Oh, now this is a good one.
Holly! Come and listen to this.

518
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,406
Sit down. So...

519
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:04,760
This Vicar is stopped for speeding,
and the policeman smells alcohol...

520
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,361
and sees an empty bottle of wine
on the passenger's side ﬂoor.

521
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,325
And he says: “Have you been drinking,
Reverend?". And the vicar says,

522
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,966
all innocent, like...

523
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,401
all innocent, like...

524
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,444
And the vicar says all innocent,
like:

525
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,884
Just water, Officer.” And the policeman
looks over to the bottle and says:

526
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,924
"“Well, that looks like wine to me."

527
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,483
"“Wine!” cries the Vicar,
“Good Lord, he's done it again."

528
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:38,045
That's funny.
Yes, that is quite funny, isn't it?

529
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,406
Mummy! Mummy!

530
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,324
Billy Martin came after me,
but Grace was there and I said "Broccoli",

531
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:50,251
and now he's dead. Billy Martin's dead!
Oh my!

532
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,967
Aren't you a busy bee?
Grace, this is Grant.

533
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,290
Ah... Is it Halloween?

534
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,609
Jokes, Grace. Have lots of them!
Oh, well done, you.

535
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,805
Oh... isn't this nice?
(Petey) Billy Martin is dead!

536
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,849
Could we have a word?
Billy Martin is dead?

537
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,010
Oh good Lord, no. No, he's not dead,
he was just unconscious, if I may judge.

538
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,045
But, please, don't tell Petey,
because he's so excited.

539
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,001
Grace, can you come and look at the pie?
Of course, dear.

540
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,045
I fucked up big time.
She shouldn't use that language.

541
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,805
Let me get this straight.
My son's rid of his bullies.

542
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,364
My husband has become a comedian.

543
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,165
And my nymphomaniac daughter
has discovered cookery.

544
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,686
What's going on?

545
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,087
Oh, I'm so sorry!

546
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:28,011
I'm so sorry. Did I wake you?
No, not at all.

547
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,045
Did I disturb you and Walter?
Chance, be a fine thing.

548
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,086
Good night.
Good night. You know,

549
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,124
men do sometimes lose their way, dear.

550
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,928
I mean, Walter is sweet soul,
but he's a bit...

551
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,964
slow-witted like the rest of them.

552
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,365
I'm sure he'll find his way back to you
in the end.

553
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,523
So you were married, too?
Yes, I was. A long time ago.

554
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,165
Did he lose his way?
With a little help from another woman.

555
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,924
Oh.
Completely lost his head over her.

556
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,284
Do you have a couple of minutes?

557
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,207
You sit down.
I've got something to show you.

558
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,006
Oh, here it is.

559
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,844
Look, that's me when I was six.

560
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,690
So sweet.
I was a live one.

561
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,324
Was?

562
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,490
Here he is. That's him.

563
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,647
What was his name?

564
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,489
Arthur.

565
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,526
He's very dipper...

566
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,328
I was a fool for a handsome fellow.
I was young. I was very young.

567
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,289
Too young.

568
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,206
And then he dabbled.

569
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,366
And that was that.

570
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,684
Walter only dabbles with God nowadays.

571
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,364
In that case he'll come back to you.

572
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,448
God would never stand in the way
of such a beautiful young woman.

573
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,282
(Music)

574
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,884
Will you find your way back to me?

575
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,289
Could you?

576
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,370
(Brown) Clarence, is that you?

577
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,649
Clarence?

578
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,766
Oh my God! Clarence!

579
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,924
God!

580
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,806
Do you think he found that bloody dog yet?
Oh, Mr Brown is on holiday.

581
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,730
Is he? Where has he gone?

582
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,884
I think, he said Down Under.
Oh.

583
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,684
Hey.

584
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,884
So...

585
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,364
I have been up every night thinking.

586
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:03,451
If we only get one chance for happiness
in our entire lives, Gloria,

587
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,765
that nobody should ever die
without having found it.

588
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,687
I'm not alone.
Huh?

589
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,326
I'm not alone.

590
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,844
Oh.

591
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,810
So, I talked to my guy,

592
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,886
and Mexico is on.

593
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,570
I got a date tomorrow.
What?

594
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,284
I told you, when I move fast.

595
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,771
Oh, that's too fast, change it.
I can't, the ticket's are booked.

596
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,690
Change the tickets.
Honey, they're booked.

597
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,326
You can't change them?

598
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:48,251
Gloria, this is everything
we've been dreaming of.

599
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:53,368
And the hotel? - Hotel's perfect.
On the beach, like you said?

600
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:58,328
Yes! I mean, walking distance, seconds.
The best hotels are on the beach, Lance.

601
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,887
Gloria,
this is so much better than a hotel.

602
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,242
For fuck's sake, it's a time share.
Here we are.

603
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,285
Oh, Grace! Grace, this is Lance,
my golf instructor.

604
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,481
Lance, that is Grace, our housekeeper.
It is very nice to meet you, Grace.

605
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:18,525
Gloria has told me all about you.
You're American.

606
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,450
Yes.
That obvious, huh?

607
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,281
Well, please don't let me interrupt you.
Oh, sorry.

608
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,324
We just talked about our next session,

609
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,922
our next practise session of golf.
Weren't we, Lance?

610
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,568
Right, practise session.
We can talk about it later, can't we?

611
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,127
Well, actually...
l kind of need to know now.

612
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,004
It can't wait?
It's all confirmed.

613
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:51,563
Well, I have concerns.
What... kind of concerns?

614
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:59,163
I just want to make sure we have
the right equipment... the right kit.

615
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,204
I'm not sure we have the right wood.

616
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,770
Hey, you are talking to me.

617
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,487
You do not have to worry yourself
about wood.

618
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,326
Yes or no, Gloria?

619
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,849
Al right.

620
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,166
Okay. Good.

621
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,844
It was nice to meet you, Lance.

622
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,929
It's a pleasure to meet you, too, Grace.

623
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,850
About 5 o'clock? The place?

624
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,490
The usual place?
Okay.

625
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,727
Okay, well, you ladies,
have a lovely lunch.

626
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,130
He's got a marvellous swing.

627
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,086
Has he?

628
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,882
I visit 2000 years ago,
I met this nice Jewish girl,

629
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,811
and they're still talking about it.
Ha, ha, ha...

630
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,450
But joking aside, it's true:

631
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:12,886
2000 years later,
and we are still talking about it,

632
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,925
and that's because it's something worth
talking about.

633
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,489
Oh, Grace.

634
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,204
With these jokes, things come alive.

635
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,811
They really do.
Excellent.

636
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,844
You're doing very well, Vicar.
Thank you.

637
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,884
Now, have you thought about sex?

638
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,084
Ah...

639
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,649
Sex?
Yes.

640
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:49,245
For the convention or...
The bible is full of sex.

641
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,204
Haven't you noticed?
The bible?

642
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,084
The song of Solomon, for example.

643
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:02,365
Ah, no, that is the passionate
declaration of love...

644
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,044
from a devoted man to God.
No!

645
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,246
It's about sex.

646
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,249
Right.

647
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,170
Here, read it again, Reverend.

648
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,570
I'll make you a cup of tea.

649
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:35,087
"Let him kiss me
with the kisses of his mouth:"

650
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,004
For thy love is better than wine.

651
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,524
His fruit was sweet to my taste.

652
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,924
His left hand is under my head,

653
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,444
and his right hand doth embrace me.

654
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,889
Behold,

655
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,810
thou art fair, my love.

656
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,809
Behold,

657
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,566
thou art fair.

658
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,484
Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet.

659
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,007
Thine eyes are as doves behind the veil.

660
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,210
And comely is thy mouth.

661
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:31,802
Thy two breasts are like forns
feeding among the lilies.

662
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,604
Thy navel is like a round goblet...

663
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,161
wherein no mingled wine is wanting.

664
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,644
Thy belly is like a heap of wheat

665
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:52,010
set about with lilies.

666
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:57,040
Let thy breasts
be as clusters on the vine.

667
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,801
And thy mouth like the best wine.

668
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,526
Open to me my dove,

669
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,651
for my head is filled
with the drops of the night.

670
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,406
Come, my beloved,

671
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,444
let us see if the wine ﬂourishes...

672
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,044
and the tender grapes appear...

673
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,164
"and the pomegranates bud forth."

674
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,762
(Music)

675
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,011
Wow... show-time!

676
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,682
(Laughing)

677
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,486
Oh. Come on.

678
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,730
Come on to Uncle Lance.

679
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,370
No, no, don't. Come back.

680
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,089
Oh yeah!

681
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,684
Oh, my Lord.
They're just like little rose petals.

682
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,922
(Music)

683
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,284
Oh.

684
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,085
Oh!

685
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,929
Oh, bingo!

686
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,320
Oh God, Lance, you're a lucky man.
Good evening.

687
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,250
Good evening. Can I help you?

688
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,047
Grace, right?
Yes.

689
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:39,005
I lost my... Have you seen my wallet?
I seem to have dropped it here.

690
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,770
Got my pen, got my speech,

691
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:56,451
and I'm really rather nervous.
You'll be fine, and I'll think of you.

692
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,087
Good.
Jesus Christ, you two, put it away.

693
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,646
Byebye.
Bye, Dad.

694
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,724
Cheerio, Petey. Goodbye, sweetheart.
Bye, Dad.

695
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,569
Grace.

696
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,850
Forgotten something, darling?

697
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,885
Have you seen Mr Brown lately?
No, he's in Australia.

698
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:32,565
I hope the convention goes well.
Yes, thank you, Grace.

699
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,566
Goodbye, all.

700
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,006
Reverend Goodfellow!

701
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,970
Reverend Goodfellow!
Mrs Parker.

702
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,004
About the ﬂower arranging committee...

703
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:56,565
which I will be more than happy to talk
to you about in a few days, when I'm back.

704
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,964
Oh.

705
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,809
I see.

706
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,684
Oh.

707
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,484
I noticed that your housekeeper...

708
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,645
was having a great deal of trouble
with her car last night.

709
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,449
Her car?

710
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:23,531
That's not Grace's car, Mrs Parker.
It's not?

711
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,004
I've seen it there often enough.

712
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,604
At first I thought it was a taxi.

713
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:55,685
Well, goodbyes are never easy,
but it's not forever, dear.

714
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:10,291
(Gloria) Hello, it's me. It's after five,
and I'm here and you're not.

715
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:14,845
So, well, it's funny actually,
because I only came here...

716
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,608
to tell you that I'm not coming,
but I guess you beat me to it.

717
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:25,011
Perhaps you're already there with
one of those girls you don't know.

718
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:28,850
Have a nice life, Lance.

719
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,765
Before the break we were talking
about murderers on parole...

720
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,406
Oh, there you are.

721
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:49,687
Dinner's at eight?
He didn't show up then?

722
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,370
What?
Your American.

723
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,247
Your golf instructor,
your practise session.

724
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,330
No, no, he didn't. He's sick.

725
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:05,244
Oh.

726
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,530
Yeah, he... he called it off.

727
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,966
Yeah.

728
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,004
A woman they called the Trunk Murderer.

729
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:17,005
Rosemary Jones, Bill.
Don't get me starred on Rosemary Jones.

730
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:22,524
<i>It really is</i> a <i>sorry day and</i> a <i>sad
society when someone like her is released.</i>

731
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,930
I think we have some pictures, do we?
Yes: The Trunk Murderer, so called.

732
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,170
Because they found her husband and his
mistress chopped up in her trunk luggage.

733
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:35,091
A month ago she was released from prison.
Mom!

734
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,204
Yeah?

735
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,210
I think you'd better see this.

736
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,167
Mom!

737
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:48,364
<i>A classical pathological psychosis</i>
<i>But the parole board said,</i>

738
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,530
she demonstrated the capacity to change.
No, no, the point is,

739
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,724
that she is out loose and among us now.
You mean. She's wandering the streets...

740
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:01,971
and up to her old tricks again?
I wouldn't put it past her, Theresa.

741
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,966
Oh my God.

742
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:21,610
God's Mysterious Ways. I think,
it's a good title, Reverend Goodfellow.

743
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,962
I really do. I like it.
Really? Thank you.

744
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,004
And they'll like it, too. I'm sure.

745
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,044
I'm taking a look.
No, I don't think,

746
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:40,131
it's the appropriate way. Holly!
Have you ever seen inside it?

747
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,766
No.
Exactly.

748
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,609
Hang on!

749
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:56,684
(Grace)
Gloria, are you here? Holly?

750
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,442
Are you up there?

751
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,084
Shit!

752
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,964
Shit!

753
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,529
Hello?

754
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,566
Are you in here?

755
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,926
Al right, my word!

756
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:36,084
Please be there, Lance.
Who's Lance?

757
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,482
(Handy ringing)

758
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,322
(Handy ringing)

759
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,482
(Unintelligible)

760
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,044
Here we are.
How does this work again?

761
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,010
Missed call, press green.

762
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,322
(Handy ringing)

763
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,449
Hello?

764
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:28,651
This is Grace speaking. Would you like
to come out from under the bed?

765
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,441
Coming.

766
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:34,924
Great to see so many new faces here today.
I know some of you came a very long way,

767
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:39,966
thank you. And some old friends, Morgan.
Great result for the rugby at the weekend.

768
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:45,006
Now, down to the more serious business
of the day, our opening address.

769
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:49,011
I'd like to introduce
the Reverend Walter Goodfellow...

770
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,044
from the Parish of Little Wallop!

771
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,246
Good evening.

772
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,050
Good evening, Gentlemen...

773
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,490
Uhm... Ladies and Gentlemen.

774
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,889
Uhm...

775
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,486
It's an honour...

776
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,126
to... to deliver...

777
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,284
the opening address
of the convention,

778
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,567
uhm, and my subject...

779
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,604
is "Cod's Mysterious Ways"... uhm...

780
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:48,244
"God's... God's Mysterious Ways",

781
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:53,171
I'm sorry,
I'm sure that Cod have mysterious ways.

782
01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:01,762
But it's the mysterious ways of God
that I wanted to talk about this evening.

783
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:07,365
Cod will just have to wait
for their own convention.

784
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,682
So! God's Mysterious Ways.

785
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,407
I'm so glad we can have this little chat.

786
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,330
What have you done with Lance, Rosemary?
You know, I prefer Rosie.

787
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,330
It takes me back to my childhood.

788
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:29,364
What have you done with Lance, Rosie?

789
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,404
Who the hell's Lance?
Yes, well,

790
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:36,724
that's the question.
You see, Lance...

791
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,490
Lance liked to make films.

792
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:44,570
Can you work this, dear?

793
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,449
Show-time.

794
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,762
Come on to Uncle Lance.

795
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:01,489
Who the hell is this guy? I'll kill him!
That won't be necessary, dear.

796
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,451
Oh my Lord.
They're just like little rose petals.

797
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,561
What?

798
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,605
Not the type you would have been
happy with in the end, dear.

799
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:13,765
Don't change the subject.
You have a dead man in your trunk!

800
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:17,965
No, no, he's not in my trunk, dear.
He's in his car.

801
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:22,047
And that wasn't just any man,
was it, Gloria?

802
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,166
That was your lover.

803
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,965
That was your lover?
Now, you've got to understand, Holly,

804
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,243
your mother's been very unhappy,
and lonely. Well, you know,

805
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:40,241
your father, well, he's a busy man,
and along comes this handsome American...

806
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:45,764
with his accent and his swing,
not the type I would approve of at all.

807
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,891
You can't go around killing people
just because you don't approve of them.

808
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:55,404
Oh, that's what my doctors used to say.
On this point we could never agree.

809
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:59,445
Anyway, I could see,
your affair was ruining the whole family!

810
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:04,088
You can't expect me to sit back
and do nothing about that, can you?

811
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:08,284
It has absolutely nothing to do with you!
It has everything to do with me.

812
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:12,166
It's the least a mother
can do for her daugh...

813
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,806
her daughter.

814
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:21,011
That's something else
we need to have a chat about.

815
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,411
They'd send me photos, now and again,
the nuns.

816
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,130
This is one of your mother
when she was your age.

817
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:40,050
Wow, Mom, you looked gorgeous.

818
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,965
Aren't we forgetting
the small matter of dead bodies?

819
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,607
How did you know about the other bodies?

820
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:55,006
What other bodies?
Oh, you didn't know about the others.

821
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,646
What other bodies?

822
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,886
Just Mr Brown's dog.

823
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,526
And Mr Brown.

824
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,091
You killed them, too.

825
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,010
I did it for you, dear.

826
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,446
My mother...

827
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:23,931
Oh, I've waited so long for you
to call me that.

828
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,850
So, what do we do now.

829
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:37,965
And when I'm asked: “Why do Vicars
always answer a question...

830
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,607
by posing another question?",
I always reply:

831
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,762
Well, why shouldn't we?
(Laughing)

832
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,809
But what, in the end,
all this comes down to,

833
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,767
is how we deal in life
with the problems that we have to face.

834
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,800
Sometimes it's a question
of just taking action,

835
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,002
of making decisions,

836
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:03,647
of involving others,
of finding your resolve,

837
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,570
and seeing it through.

838
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,801
But at other times,
it's about something much less tangible.

839
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:18,202
Sometimes all it takes is a little grace.

840
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,210
A little of God's grace,

841
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:44,444
and all our problems seem to fade away.

842
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,769
Now, should we demand
an explanation from our Lord?

843
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:01,130
Question his methods?

844
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:05,086
Or should we merely enjoy the benefits?

845
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,884
Well,

846
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:14,242
I don't think the good Lord
wants us to question too much.

847
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:18,610
Isaiah, Chapter 55, verse 8:

848
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,490
"“My ways are not your ways."

849
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:28,011
And I think,
what he basically means by that is:

850
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,690
“I'm mysterious, folks.

851
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,446
"Live with it."

852
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,964
Thank you very much. Thank you.

853
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:56,084
Oh, Jesus Christ, I can't do it.
It's alright.

854
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:01,160
I didn't chop him up or anything
grizzly like that. Where are you going?

855
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,170
I'm not doing it.
But I can't drive.

856
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,409
I'm not getting in the car.
But, I'm a learner.

857
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,570
Officially I need someone with me.
I think, under the circumstances.

858
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,207
The normal rules do not apply.
Grace, wait.

859
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,970
Who is it?
Mrs Parker.

860
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,524
I suppose I have to use the pond again.

861
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,489
Again?

862
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:38,569
No, I don't want to know. I go inside,
and you do whatever you have to do.

863
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:42,807
And I thought being an orphan
was a bad thing.

864
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,042
(Unintelligible)

865
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:56,530
Oh my God, he's really stiff.

866
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:02,047
Oh, Holly, do you have to?
I never saw anything like this before.

867
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,889
Oh my God.

868
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,769
Oh my God.

869
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,850
Oh, my God, that's...

870
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,926
It's just not fair.

871
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,844
Other daughters get to plan weddings,

872
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,567
and bake cakes, and go shopping
with their mothers. And what do I do?

873
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:24,605
Dispose of dead bodies.
I could say the same, you know.

874
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,410
Oh, shall put the kettle on?

875
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:36,009
Men were the downfall of the Jones women
for as long as there were Jones women,

876
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:39,806
and that's why you have to be careful
about the types you bring home, dear.

877
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:44,402
Wild and dangerous might be appealing now,
but believe me, you're on the same road.

878
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:48,966
You are.
I should get me a boyfriend like Dad?

879
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:54,643
Oh my God, you would, wouldn't you?
There's nothing wrong with your father.

880
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:58,730
I knew you were a bitch to him,
but I always thought you loved him.

881
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,366
I do love him.

882
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:05,047
I do love him.
Then What about the letch?

883
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:08,967
I'm assuming Dad doesn't know about him?

884
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:16,691
Because I don't think he should,
I don't think he should know anything.

885
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:21,684
Right, Grace?
Mom's the word, dear.

886
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,322
(Music)

887
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:48,242
Oh, you're awake. I brought you some tea.
Thank you.

888
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:53,491
Mrs Parker, last night, do you think
she might have seen something?

889
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,449
No, why?

890
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,290
She's on her way over.

891
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,448
That doesn't mean to say she saw anything.
Who?

892
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:11,565
What are you talking about?
Mrs Parker, maybe she saw something.

893
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:15,207
She did not see anything last night.
She saw you last night.

894
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,208
No.
Possibly.

895
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:20,767
(Bell ringing) Oh my God!
I'll see to her.

896
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:25,044
Oh no, you won't. You'll stay right here.
You've seen to quite enough already.

897
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,970
Oh my God.
Just keep calm.

898
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:31,524
Mrs. Goodfellow, did I wake you?

899
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:36,565
Actually, yes.
I was hoping your husband would be home.

900
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,169
I need to speak to him.
No, sorry, he's away.

901
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:44,205
He's on a three day convention.
It's about the...

902
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:47,444
the ﬂower arranging committee.

903
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,849
Oh, uhm...

904
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:54,089
you'll have to talk to him, not to me.
Cynthia Martin...

905
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:58,125
has been doing her level best
to undermine my leadership.

906
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,004
I believe she's planning a coup.

907
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,490
A coup?
Behind my back, yes!

908
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:09,924
If you don't mind, I just need to sit.

909
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:16,605
Behind my back
and behind the Reverend's back as well.

910
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,251
It's a disgrace.
I would even go as far as saying,

911
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:26,207
it is amoral.
And knowing what I know now,

912
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:30,883
I don't see howl can keep quiet.
Jesus Christ, I knew it. She knows!

913
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:36,211
And when the Reverend finds out,
he will be mortified, I can assure you.

914
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:39,369
I'm going to tell him, Mrs Goodfellow.
Grace. Grace, no.

915
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:43,121
No matter how much damage is done,
he must be told.

916
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:47,165
Well, I'm sure Walter will have
a quiet word with Cynthia Martin,

917
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:51,046
and it will be all sorted out.
But it's not just Mrs Martin.

918
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:54,687
They've all got
their sordid little agendas.

919
01:25:55,160 --> 01:26:00,087
In sixty years, Mrs. Goodfellow,
I have never known anything like it.

920
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:05,126
And in my condition, too.
It's really affecting my heart, you know

921
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:09,165
I really do wish it didn't have to come
to this, but it does.

922
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:13,091
Your husband must be told.
That's quite enough, Mrs Parker.

923
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:16,363
Out of the way, dear.
What are you doing?

924
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:20,086
I will not have this family torn apart
after all we've been through.

925
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:24,842
She knows! She was going to tell dad.
About the ﬂower arranging committee!

926
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,487
This has nothing to do
with anything else...

927
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,490
Mrs Parker?
Oh, dear.

928
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:37,087
Mrs Parker, can you hear me?
Shit, is she...

929
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:41,765
Yes, I believe she is.

930
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:44,406
Oh, God. Oh, God.

931
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:50,044
She said herself, she had a dickey heart.
I think you might have a dickey heart,

932
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:54,244
if someone came at you with a frying pan.
Well, it was a simple misunderstanding,

933
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:57,921
it could happen to anybody.
This cannot go on, mother! It is enough.

934
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:01,965
I understand you're upset, dear.
I am! I've got two dead bodies.

935
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,971
One in the pond, one in the sitting room.
You've got 3 dead bodies in the pond,

936
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,004
you forgot...
I do not want to know.

937
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:12,044
This has gone too far, and I mean it.

938
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:15,006
I understand.

939
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,927
I It's not
as if anyone's going to miss her.

940
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,446
Mom? Dad is back.

941
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,289
Hello!

942
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,929
Hello!

943
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,291
There we are.
Hello, sweetheart.

944
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,563
Hi, Dad.
I'll tell you, I've just had the best...

945
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:44,491
Sorry, I was saying,
I had the best convention.

946
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:50,090
Hello, everyone. Oh, Mrs Parker.
How are you this morning? - She's fine.

947
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:54,091
Darling, I thought it was three days.
It was going to be three days, but...

948
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:58,284
It's so lovely to see you. - Bye, Dad.
I want to hear all about it.

949
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:01,210
Well, I delivered my sermon.

950
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,201
And, how did it go?
Very well, I even had them laughing.

951
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:10,529
But you know what was really amazing?
It was what happened afterwards.

952
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,565
Because I was getting praise
from everybody, from the counsel...

953
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:19,003
and my peers. Normally that would be...
But you know what I was thinking?

954
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,646
Why am I here?

955
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:28,483
Well, you've always been a deep thinker.
When... what matters most to<i>me...</i>

956
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,126
is back home.

957
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:36,486
Oh, darling.

958
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,124
So,

959
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:47,011
they made love in every room in the house,
did they, Lilian and Brian?

960
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,404
And they went around twice.
Twice.

961
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:56,529
I think we have some catching up to do.
No, I have to see to Mrs Parker.

962
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:01,282
Oh, gosh, yes. Do you need me?
No, it's the ﬂower arranging committee.

963
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:04,051
I swear, it'll be the death of her.

964
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:09,328
Mrs Parker's sudden passing
came as a dreadful shock to us all,

965
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:16,166
but as we well know,
God does move in mysterious ways.

966
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:22,291
Which reminds me of a keynote address
which I deliver recently,

967
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:26,006
of which I think
Mrs Parker would have approved.

968
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,044
Excellent sermon, Reverend.
Thank you.

969
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:33,129
Thank you, goodbye.
It was. It was very good.

970
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,481
Reverend Goodfellow.
Mrs Martin.

971
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,809
I wonder if we might have a talk about
the ﬂower arranging committee this week.

972
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,447
No, but perhaps next week.
I'll let you know.

973
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,366
Oh... very well.

974
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:50,970
Goodbye.

975
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,286
(Grace) Who is it?

976
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:41,210
It's me.
Oh, come in.

977
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,727
I think this is for the best, don't you?

978
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,842
"My dearest Gloria,"

979
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:16,885
it was a slice of heaven
to finally meet you, my dear.

980
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:21,405
You have made a mad old woman
a very happy mad old women.

981
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:25,687
I'll miss you and your beautiful family,

982
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:29,851
but I'll be visiting,
just you try and stop me.

983
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,965
"Love to you all,
Mother."

984
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:42,804
"Dear Mother, how many months
has it been now Two, three, four?"

985
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,844
Yet still we talk about you all the time.

986
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:49,441
We're looking forward to your visit,
and lots planned for the whole family.

987
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:52,609
So what's new and exciting here
in Little Wallop, you may ask.

988
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:56,804
Holly's got a very nice new boyfriend,
and she told me to tell you,

989
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:59,923
that you'd be pleased with her choice.
He's not like the others.

990
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:03,965
I actually believe he might be
a calming influence on her.

991
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:09,411
"And Petey's doing very well,
turning into quite a confident young man."

992
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:13,401
Which reminds me of the time,
an Englishman, an Irishman, a Scotsman,

993
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,922
a Vicar, a Rabbi, and a Priest all walk
into a pub, and the barman says:

994
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:18,962
“What is this, some kind of a joke?"
(Laughing)

995
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:24,162
"Walter's a changed man, too.
I'd even go so far to say,

996
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,522
that our life here together is complete."

997
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:29,562
(Unintelligible)

998
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:37,841
"I'm by his side in all the ways he needs,
and he's by mine in all the ways I need."

999
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:42,205
Mrs Parker felt that not enough was being
done to this part of the railings...

1000
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:46,848
inside the church Whilst too much
is covered in the front porch.

1001
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,885
"By the time you read this you'll have
arrived at your new job. Good luck,

1002
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:58,609
I hope there are no hitches, but something
tells me that you'll do fine."

1003
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,162
(Walter's speaking)

1004
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:25,011
Hi, darling. You remember Bob and Ted.
I'm afraid it's as we feared.

1005
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:27,287
The pond. Algae.

1006
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:31,325
Bluegreen algae.
Which apparently is quite serious.

1007
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:35,244
It's very serious.
Very, very serious.

1008
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:39,490
So, we're just discussing the options.
As I explained to Reverend Goodfellow,

1009
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:43,684
your pond is in the water-table.
So the algae doesn't only effect you

1010
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:47,691
it effects the whole village
And the blue-green algae.

1011
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:52,408
Is one of the worst you can get.
So there's really just the one option.

1012
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:56,047
Yes, as he says, really there's really...

1013
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:59,050
just the one option.
Which is?

1014
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:00,889
Drain it.

1015
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,649
Drain it.

1016
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,122
Shall I put the kettle on?

1017
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:26,082
(Gloria) "So, between you and us,
I'd say life if very good indeed."

1018
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:30,045
No dramas, no crisis, it just ambles along
in its quite merry way.

1019
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:33,721
A couple of hiccup here and there,
of course, like the pond.

1020
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:37,890
Which now they tell us needs draining.
Which is a bit of a farce,

1021
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:41,925
"as you could imagine,
but I'm sure we'll sort something out."

1022
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:46,922
(Music)

1023
01:35:11,547 --> 01:35:22,047
