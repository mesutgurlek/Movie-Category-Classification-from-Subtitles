1
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:51,548
Follow the area.

2
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:03,548
Good.

3
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:11,980
Hold this angle to the hole.

4
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:25,628
Very good.

5
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:40,102
Under different conditions you
have to compensate on the wind.

6
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:53,340
Now keep this height.

7
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:24,540
Control your height! Easy!

8
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:34,823
You can앖 fly like this in real life.

9
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:38,460
How high can I fly then?

10
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:34,581
Are we taking the elevator?
-All the way up.

11
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:44,221
Hello.
-Hello. -I have an appointment.

12
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:46,705
Sir Vendice is already busy.

13
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:49,419
Can I help you with anything else?
- No.

14
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:50,898
My problem is ...

15
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:53,743
... of erotic nature.

16
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:02,259
... can we do business
like that? No.

17
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:04,900
We had an agreement.

18
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:09,628
Unacceptable.

19
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:12,498
We had an agreement,
and it stays like that.

20
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:14,499
No.

21
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:18,825
That압 ok too.
Then we앏l just ask someone else.

22
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:21,061
Yes, we앏l do it like that. That changes everything.

23
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:25,105
Twentythree,
twentytwo, twentyone ...

24
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:49,259
Ulcom Electonics.

25
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,901
Yes, I have an urgent message.
Your car alarm just went off.

26
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:58,143
Come quick,
the noise is intolerable.

27
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:14,338
Good day.

28
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:20,748
Polizeievie.

29
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:23,462
I았e called you so many times,
but you didn앖 do anything.

30
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:25,905
Now I앐 doing it myself.

31
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:29,779
In his office is a bomb.
It will explode in ...

32
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:31,859
fifty seconds.

33
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:33,702
Who is this?

34
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:37,177
Philippa. Philippa Paccard.

35
00:08:38,989 --> 00:08:41,583
No, I won앖 make it before seven.

36
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:45,299
I have so much to do here, I앐 sorry.
Please wait for me.

37
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:47,860
Ok, then we앏l see eachother at home.

38
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:10,745

So high.

40
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:23,780
Oh, I앏l take the next one.

41
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,908
No, there압 plenty of space here.
-Thank you.

42
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:51,503

What now, you want to speak English?

45
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:31,542
What압 this?

46
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:34,784
What the hell are you trying?

47
00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:40,018
English...

48
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:48,423
Yeah so?
- She wants to testify in English.

49
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:50,865
We will use an interpreter.

50
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:52,738
No way.

51
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:55,222
No interpreter.

52
00:12:55,749 --> 00:12:57,068
She understands us very well.

53
00:12:57,469 --> 00:12:59,664
Every word. Stop playing!

54
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:03,061
It압 her right.
-I shit on her rights.

55
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:06,067
She will have to listen to Italian,

56
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:08,778
speak Italian and testify.
In Italian!

57
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:14,228
Excuse me ...

58
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:16,988
I can translate.

59
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:22,308
I앐 qualified.

60
00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:32,058

Family status?

65
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:57,987
You don앖 know,
if youre married?

66
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:11,541
Did you talk about the divorce?

67
00:14:14,869 --> 00:14:16,700
Then you are widow.

68
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:30,984
You are being accused, of the explosion
in an office building,

69
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:34,108
where four people died.

70
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:41,584
Four?

71
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:43,388
Yes, four.

72
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:48,541
Because of the explotion
an elevator fell down.

73
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:52,179
There were four people inside.

74

A father with his two daughters
and a cleaning lady.

00:14:56,469 --> 00:14:58,539
Three of them were immediately dead.

76
00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:02,942
The youngest girl died last night
in the hospital.

77
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:07,341
You are accused,
of being with a terrorist organization,

78
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:10,024
with the goal,
of destabilizing the State,

79
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:13,302
as well as murdering four people.

80
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:26,057
Four people isn앖 enough for you?

81
00:16:33,349 --> 00:16:36,705
Which organization are you with?
From where did you get the bomb?

82
00:16:37,109 --> 00:16:38,747
Who gave you the order?

00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:43,348
And your husband?

84
00:16:57,629 --> 00:16:59,142
And how did he die?

85
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:14,587
Where did you call?

86
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:18,417
On what grounds?

87
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:39,027
And because of you four
people died yesterday!

88
00:17:41,189 --> 00:17:44,306
What압 this shit about that dealer?

Fast!

96
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,025
What압 wrong?

97
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:52,426
She fainted.

98
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:00,057
Come on!

99
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,338
Wake up ...

100
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:10,021
Make her arms free.

101
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:20,582
No, this arm. - But ...
- Go please. I don앖 need your help anymore.

102
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,383
And close the door.

103
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:26,825
Now, stay still.

104
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:33,544
... I앐 still at the police station.
Yes, they got her.

105
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:40,300
I앏l call back later.

106
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:37,021
... while we waited in class
for the teacher,

107
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,546
the agency came and said,
she wouldn앖 come anymore.

108
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:45,503
What압 wrong, guys?
Why the sad faces?

109
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:51,581
How was your day?

110
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:54,418
Fine.

111
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:06,307
He told me everything.
- What do you mean?

112
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:08,620
About my English teacher.

113
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:07,102
What are you doing in there?

114
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:08,985
Laundry.

115
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:11,547
I had an accident in bed.

116
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:20,338
In bed? That hasn앖 happened
since ten years.

117
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:29,862
What압 wrong?

118
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:40,907
Now, tell me.

119
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:45,101
I앐 in love.

120
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:49,383
She also states, that this Vendice

121
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:52,781

to sell drugs?

122
00:23:53,189 --> 00:23:54,588
Where would he do that?

123
00:24:20,109 --> 00:24:23,146
She says, even the Carabineri
got a discount. - What압 she talking about?

124
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:39,738
We checked everything: no letters,

125
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:43,266
no phone calls, nothing was reported.
There is absolutely nothing!

126
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,267
We will check it out.

127
00:25:09,469 --> 00:25:10,663
Major.

128
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,140
We will take a short break.

129
00:25:31,469 --> 00:25:33,027
Excuse me.

130
00:25:42,189 --> 00:25:43,861
Hello, Filippo.

So you are working now.

132
00:25:47,949 --> 00:25:50,019
Yes. The fun is over.

133
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:53,741
And youre doing the same
as your father?

134
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:56,259
Yes.

135
00:26:04,349 --> 00:26:06,067
I앇 like some laxative.

136
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:08,058
Ofcourse.

137
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:18,462
Did you keep these letters
in a green bambu-box?

138
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:23,227
In the top desk drawer?

139
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:27,659
Six letters to your husband,

140
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:29,980
from 1994 to 1997.

141
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:35,419
Three letters which date to last year
from your sister in England.

142
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,223
Two wedding rings ...

143
00:27:37,629 --> 00:27:42,145
and a postcard from a student
which you got 3 weeks ago.

144
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:44,421
That압 everything.

145
00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:53,818
Miss!

146
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:56,061

Miss Paccard.

150
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:31,258
Were not interested in your
stories, your calls, your letters,

151
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,500
your husband or your school.

152
00:28:34,189 --> 00:28:37,067
We want to know,

We want to know:
Where did you get the bomb?

156
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:45,901
And who helped you?

157
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:53,228
I았e had enough of your lies.

158
00:28:53,629 --> 00:28:55,665
Where did you get the bomb?

159
00:29:01,749 --> 00:29:03,068
Answer me!

160
00:29:20,589 --> 00:29:23,626
And their father.
And a 50-year-old woman.

00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:36,424
What압 wrong?

162
00:29:38,749 --> 00:29:42,628
It seems to be only this building.
- Go check it out.

163
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:44,064
Isn앖 there any backup light?

164
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:54,223
What압 wrong?
- No idea, Major.

165
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:05,145
I wanted to dry my hands,

166
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:07,864
and then the power went down.

167
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:13,427
We have enough for now.

168
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:16,381
Bring her back to her cell.

169
00:30:50,229 --> 00:30:52,584
the letters are no problem.

170
00:30:53,949 --> 00:30:56,941
We got rid of them,
before she knew about it.

171
00:30:57,709 --> 00:30:58,664
And now?

172
00:30:59,069 --> 00:31:03,028
I앏l keep my eyes on her.
Untill now no-one believes her.

173
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:04,418
Good.

174
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:07,184
Are we sure?

175
00:31:07,589 --> 00:31:08,738
At the moment, yes.

176
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:12,744
But it압 better,
if we give her something.

177
00:32:35,629 --> 00:32:38,097
What was that?
- A recording.

178
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:41,941
But you don앖 understand anything of it!
- One moment.

179
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,426
Let압 try again.

180
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:47,903
Perfect.

181
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:52,025
get rid of it.
- What?

182
00:36:52,429 --> 00:36:55,148
You heard me.
get rid of it!

183
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:57,900
You will let them get away?

184
00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:02,824
It압 not a very good idea,
to escape from the inquiry.

185
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:06,142
It will bring you in danger.

186
00:37:07,149 --> 00:37:10,425
I wonder,
if they will make it out alive.

187
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:51,142
Aren앖 you affraid?

188
00:37:57,669 --> 00:37:59,227
Ofcourse, I앐 affraid.

189
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:01,021
You feel better?

193
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:28,661
What did she say?

194
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:45,828
In the toilet I found
a bag, a n...

195
00:39:46,229 --> 00:39:49,062
a note and a key.

196
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:53,383
When?

197
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:19,026
Throw ... me ... away.

198
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:26,707
Miss!

199
00:41:29,549 --> 00:41:30,504
Please ...

200
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,064
Go with her.

201
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:10,898
This is the police.

202
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:14,062
Could you please put me through
with phone nr. 345.

203
00:42:59,229 --> 00:42:59,786
Hello?

204
00:43:00,189 --> 00:43:05,183
This is the Hart Clinic Lippi. Can I
please speak with Mr. Cassande?

205
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:08,379
That압 me.

206
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:12,782
The doctor wants to speak with you.
Please hold.

207
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:21,898
Hello?

208
00:43:34,709 --> 00:43:35,778
Hello?

209
00:43:44,749 --> 00:43:46,148
Mr. prosecutor.

210
00:43:46,909 --> 00:43:48,786
Look over here!

211
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,979
What is it?
-Isn앖 that her?

212
00:43:53,709 --> 00:43:56,303
Yes, that압 her! How is that possible?

213
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:58,267
Quick to the main entrance!

214
00:43:58,669 --> 00:43:59,465
Where is she?

215
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:01,143
At the rear-exit.

216
00:44:01,549 --> 00:44:03,585
No! Quick to the front! She압 coming!

217
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:10,259
Shit!

218
00:44:39,029 --> 00:44:40,781
Hey, you! Show yourself!

219
00:44:43,469 --> 00:44:44,902
Excuse me.

220
00:45:28,269 --> 00:45:30,829
Go, go, together!

221
00:45:33,069 --> 00:45:34,661
Check the station!

222
00:45:40,669 --> 00:45:43,741
The interpreter!
Bring me the interpreter!

223
00:48:02,229 --> 00:48:04,948
Good evening.
Can I please speak Mr Vendice?

224
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:06,259
Who압 speaking?

225
00:48:06,669 --> 00:48:09,866
I have an urgent message
from Major Pini.

226
00:48:10,269 --> 00:48:15,059
Mr. Vendice isn앖 here at the moment.
You want to leave him a message?

227
00:48:16,149 --> 00:48:21,303
Yes, could you ask him to call Major Pini
at his offoice as soon as possible.

228
00:48:21,749 --> 00:48:25,025
I repeat, at his office.
It압 important.

229
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:31,065
Yes?

230
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,458
Vittorio?

231
00:49:35,789 --> 00:49:37,905
The major is gone for a while.

232
00:49:38,629 --> 00:49:39,903
Mr. Vendice?

233
00:49:40,709 --> 00:49:41,585
Yes.

234
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:44,943
The major wants to speak you urgently.

235
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,067
Now? Where?

236
00:49:47,629 --> 00:49:49,187
Here at his office.

237
00:49:49,669 --> 00:49:52,342
I앏l be right there.
Did you get rid of her?

238
00:49:55,069 --> 00:49:57,424
Yes, she압 been taken care of.

239
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:04,297
I know, it압 late,
but I have to go there.

240
00:50:05,389 --> 00:50:09,348
It압 very important. Don앖 wait for me.
I앏l wake you up, when I get home.

241
00:50:12,269 --> 00:50:13,861
I know, I know ...

242
00:50:15,549 --> 00:50:16,982
I앏l see you later.

243
00:51:23,429 --> 00:51:25,420
Do you remember me?

244
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:28,425
Yes.

245
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:57,940
... the people at the police
aren앖 sure ...

246
00:55:58,349 --> 00:56:00,067
Do they think, it was the woman,

247
00:56:00,469 --> 00:56:02,983
who planted the bomb?
- Why not? With those kind of women ...

248
00:56:03,389 --> 00:56:06,461
I앇 like to plant a bomb for them.
- How did she get away?

249
00:56:07,669 --> 00:56:11,184
Someone must have helped her.
- I앐 still shocked about it.

250
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:15,059
Can you get insurance for something like that?
- I don앖 know.

251
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:30,543
Nice dress, where did you get it?
- Yes, it압 nice, isn앖 it?

252
00:56:32,149 --> 00:56:32,979
I got it ...

253
00:56:36,549 --> 00:56:40,588
... my aunt has a perfumery there.
- A perfumery? - Yes ...

254
00:56:40,989 --> 00:56:43,549
You let the water run all morning.

255
00:56:48,389 --> 00:56:50,300
I won앖 forget that face.

256
00:56:50,709 --> 00:56:54,258
It will always haunt me.
His face was almost gone.

257
00:56:55,469 --> 00:56:59,257
It was like those pig heads,
I get for my dog at the butcher.

258
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:03,662
Only, now there was an expression on it.
- Bah, the way you talk about it!

259
00:57:04,069 --> 00:57:06,139
I still have to go to the butcher.

260
00:57:07,429 --> 00:57:10,421
What would it be called anyways,
with an expression on it?

261
00:57:13,789 --> 00:57:15,586
It압 beautiful, isn앖 it?
- Yes.

262
00:57:15,989 --> 00:57:20,267
And, when you
get at the station,

263
00:57:20,669 --> 00:57:22,899
there is a little bar at the corner ...

264
01:00:31,869 --> 01:00:33,860
Closed

265
01:01:24,589 --> 01:01:28,468
... The investigation of the
murder on Vendice last night

266
01:01:28,869 --> 01:01:31,827
is concentrated on the English
woman Philippa Paccard,

267
01:01:32,229 --> 01:01:36,620
who was being interrogated because
of the bombing at Ulcom Electronics.

268
01:01:37,309 --> 01:01:40,426
Miss Paccard, who escaped
from the building before the murder,

269
01:01:40,829 --> 01:01:45,300
admitted, that the bomb was 
meant to kill Mr. Vendice.

270
01:01:45,749 --> 01:01:48,502
Miss Paccards husband
was a friend of Vendice.

271
01:01:48,909 --> 01:01:53,380
This connection is a possible
motive for the police.

272
01:01:53,789 --> 01:01:57,384
Miss Paccard lives in Italy,
and was born in England.

273
01:01:57,789 --> 01:02:02,909
They are affraid, that she will try,
to get shelter in England.

274
01:02:03,309 --> 01:02:06,187
That압 why the police

275
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:08,307
are searching

276
01:02:08,709 --> 01:02:11,348
at international borders.

277
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:15,020
And now for the weather broadcast ...

278
01:10:24,077 --> 01:10:25,669
I앇 like some silence please!

279
01:10:28,597 --> 01:10:31,111
Today is a happy day for me.

280
01:10:31,517 --> 01:10:34,350
Today is the wedding of my
little niece Paola.

281
01:10:51,637 --> 01:10:54,834
I was the first to experience.
And so ...

282
01:11:09,157 --> 01:11:11,546
And now we will raise our glass.

283
01:11:12,677 --> 01:11:15,191
Everyone together and attention!

284
01:11:15,597 --> 01:11:19,306
Like it압 called in "La Traviata":
"Song of the singer!"

285
01:11:26,197 --> 01:11:27,676
Don앖 you recognize me?

286
01:12:02,757 --> 01:12:04,748
What have you done, damnit?

287
01:12:09,997 --> 01:12:11,749
What did you do?

288
01:12:25,957 --> 01:12:28,471
You flew over the court with
a helicopter.

289
01:12:52,277 --> 01:12:53,915
Nice haircut.

290
01:13:00,277 --> 01:13:02,916
Can we stay at your place for the night?

291
01:13:06,637 --> 01:13:08,389
They will come for you.

292
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:16,146
I know.

293
01:13:18,397 --> 01:13:20,353
Cesae-Pavese-School. Good day.

294
01:13:20,957 --> 01:13:23,596
Hello. This is Ariel Fabrizi.

295
01:13:23,997 --> 01:13:27,626
Can I speak with my son Ariel?
He압 in computer class.

296
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:29,834
One moment. I앏l get him.

297
01:13:30,237 --> 01:13:31,147
Thank you.

298
01:13:42,557 --> 01:13:43,512
Hello?

299
01:13:43,917 --> 01:13:47,273
Don앖 worry, it압 me.
Act like youre talking with daddy.

300
01:13:47,677 --> 01:13:48,666
Yes, daddy.

301
01:13:49,277 --> 01:13:51,711
Say: "I앏l come home sooner, daddy."

302
01:13:52,117 --> 01:13:53,789
I앏l come home sooner, daddy.

303
01:13:54,197 --> 01:13:57,872
Look out,
tell daddy, we want to see him.

304
01:13:58,277 --> 01:14:00,188
We are in Montepulciano.

305
01:14:00,717 --> 01:14:03,675
We will wait for him
at the church of San Biagio.

306
01:14:05,837 --> 01:14:08,476
Now say: "That압 ok, daddy" And hang up.

307
01:14:08,917 --> 01:14:10,396
That압 ok, daddy.

308
01:14:11,237 --> 01:14:12,590
Bye, Ariel.

309
01:15:59,517 --> 01:16:01,030
Dad!

310
01:16:12,517 --> 01:16:14,155
You look horrible!

311
01:16:16,357 --> 01:16:17,836
Dad.

312
01:16:18,677 --> 01:16:20,508
This is Philippa.

313
01:16:27,797 --> 01:16:29,674
Lets go inside.

314
01:16:43,317 --> 01:16:45,467
Sit down.

315
01:17:00,557 --> 01:17:02,229
Here압 some money.

316
01:17:14,397 --> 01:17:15,227
You smoke?

317
01:17:23,037 --> 01:17:25,870
People are searching all
over for you.

318
01:17:26,837 --> 01:17:29,431
They assume,
you are still in Italy.

319
01:17:30,037 --> 01:17:33,347
They even blocked the city.

320
01:17:34,957 --> 01:17:37,755
I think, that they aren앖 
checking other places yet.

321
01:17:38,157 --> 01:17:40,910
But they will do so very fast.

322
01:17:44,357 --> 01:17:46,268
You can come with me.

323
01:17:46,797 --> 01:17:48,515
It압 worth the try.

324
01:18:04,037 --> 01:18:05,675
I won앖 come with you.

325
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:12,346
But I would be very thankful,
if you take Filippo with you.

326
01:18:21,837 --> 01:18:23,828
he told me, he loves you.

327
01:18:28,397 --> 01:18:29,307
Yes.

328
01:18:31,357 --> 01:18:32,836
And you?

329
01:19:00,317 --> 01:19:01,306
Yes.

330
01:19:13,717 --> 01:19:15,673
I won앖 come either, daddy.

331
01:19:19,717 --> 01:19:20,991
I know.

332
01:19:23,197 --> 01:19:25,074
I don앖 know you very good.

333
01:19:34,517 --> 01:19:39,147
Why can앖 we do anything
about this?

334
01:20:17,957 --> 01:20:19,993
