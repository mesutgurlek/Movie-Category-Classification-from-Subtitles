1
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:58,219
Some fun tonight?

2
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:01,182
Come.

3
00:03:20,113 --> 00:03:22,308
What would you like to drink?

4
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:25,079
This way.

5
00:03:43,437 --> 00:03:44,904
Hello.

6
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:51,140
You are...

7
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:55,680
Young At Heart 69.

8
00:04:00,353 --> 00:04:01,377
Password?

9
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:02,683
Purity.

10
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,184
Shut up.

11
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:06,782
He's a paying customer.

12
00:04:09,463 --> 00:04:11,090
Sit down, please.

13
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:15,298
Do you have the money?

14
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:18,396
Yeah.

15
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:22,667
Can I see your Sasha first?

16
00:04:25,212 --> 00:04:26,304
You don't trust me?

17
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:31,415
It's a lot of money for one hour.

18
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:44,058
Your first time in my country?

19
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:49,230
You don't talk much.

20
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:51,533
Makes me a little nervous.

21
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:56,234
You want to make me nervous?

22
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,808
Oh, no.

23
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:59,576
No.

24
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:03,145
"No." That's good.

25
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,650
- "No."
- No.

26
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,580
Sasha.

27
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:13,853
He's a good boy.

28
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,821
Speaks English, a little.

29
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:22,563
One hour.

30
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:43,517
I have friends,

31
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:46,324
friends all over the world,

32
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,261
even in that little bastard's shit village.

33
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,489
And my friend there just called
to tell me that Sasha's mother

34
00:05:54,568 --> 00:05:57,128
has some rich cousin in America who has,

35
00:05:57,203 --> 00:06:00,570
how you say, very deep pockets.

36
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:03,601
And this uncle has hired a man,

37
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:06,769
a very serious man,

38
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:10,016
to get the kid back.

39
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:13,346
That hurts,

40
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:18,581
not only my feelings,
but my reputation, my business.

41
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:22,757
I just want the kid. I will pay more.

42
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:29,090
I love to bargain, but we have a problem.

43
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:33,730
- You've seen our faces.
- We have the same problem.

44
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:36,735
You've seen mine.

45
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:16,439
It's okay.

46
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:26,614
I will not hurt you.

47
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:30,553
Your mama sent me.

48
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:32,984
Your real name is Victor, right?

49
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:39,054
I'm here to take you out. We go home.

50
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,326
You ready? Let's go.

51
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:49,051
A subtitle made possible by R3V0LV3R.

52
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:25,338
Come on, come on.

53
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:37,814
Sit.

54
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:42,958
We got a problem. No one leaves.

55
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:48,000
Something's wrong. No one leaves.

56
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:52,694
- You like fireworks?
- Yeah.

57
00:09:58,178 --> 00:09:59,236
Hey, over there!

58
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:56,524
Hello?

59
00:10:56,603 --> 00:11:00,232
The car is waiting for you downstairs.
Get here now.

60
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:03,498
- You owe me.
- What?

61
00:12:05,305 --> 00:12:07,102
I stuck my neck out for you.

62
00:12:07,941 --> 00:12:09,806
Gave you intelligence.

63
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:11,608
Risked my career,

64
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:14,346
the lives of my family.

65
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:16,540
And this is what you do?

66
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,849
It's what I do. I got the child out.

67
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:21,752
That's good.

68
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:29,054
What about this child?

69
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:34,797
She was, what, 14?

70
00:12:38,972 --> 00:12:40,166
And her?

71
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:42,871
She was nine, maybe 10.

72
00:12:50,383 --> 00:12:54,717
Do you know what these fuckers do
when they think they're being raided?

73
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:59,518
They hide the underage girls in the walls.

74
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:03,162
Then you, last night, out here blasting.

75
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:05,627
The first thing they do

76
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:08,392
is shove the kids in the crawl space.

77
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,469
And then you turn the parking lot
into a fucking inferno.

78
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:15,731
Well, guess what?

79
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:18,273
Fire spreads.

80
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,111
Most of them died from smoke inhalation.

81
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:34,759
I know you mean well.

82
00:13:34,894 --> 00:13:36,725
But you're not a cop.

83
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:38,363
You're a soldier.

84
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,264
And this is not Africa or Afghanistan.

85
00:13:41,834 --> 00:13:44,632
You might be used to collateral damage,
but I'm not.

86
00:13:47,974 --> 00:13:49,271
Are you arresting me?

87
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:52,673
And what?

88
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,446
Lose my career when they start digging?

89
00:13:57,216 --> 00:13:58,410
Here's my advice.

90
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:00,950
Leave police work to the police.

91
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:04,522
Stick to what you know.
Go back to your shop.

92
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:34,780
I mean, up until recently,
Moldova wasn't even a real country,

93
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:36,481
it was part of the Soviet Union.

94
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,613
So, is there like a Moldovan language?

95
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:42,421
Officially, yes, but from what I read,
it's a Romanian dialect.

96
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:44,122
Apparently, a lot of people
speak Russian too.

97
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:47,162
Well, I just hope that
they speak some English.

98
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,463
- Is that for us?
- Only the best for my girls.

99
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,765
Nice. Now all we need are paparazzi.

100
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:56,636
You want paparazzi?
Hold on, princess, I'll give you paparazzi.

101
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:01,780
There. There, nice. There we go.

102
00:15:02,014 --> 00:15:04,482
- Oh, yeah, I like that.
- Okay, come on.

103
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:07,316
Yeah, you are a natural.

104
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:11,246
Oh, no. No photos, no photos.

105
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:14,292
The lady doth protest too much.

106
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:16,684
Go.

107
00:15:16,796 --> 00:15:20,197
That's it, that's it, perfect.
One more like that.

108
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:23,302
Okay, come on, let's go.

109
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,932
Andrew, I've been awake for 20 hours.

110
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:31,466
- All right, princess, come on. Mommy's tired.
- Daddy's a Jackass.

111
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:33,670
But he's our Jackass.

112
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:13,946
You know, you might actually experience
the place a little better

113
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,387
if you stopped a moment
to really look at the city

114
00:16:17,456 --> 00:16:18,480
with your eyes.

115
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:22,553
Last week, Laurie Perkins
posted pictures from Paris.

116
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:25,028
I figure I can outdo her in uniqueness,
if not in grandeur.

117
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,763
Admit it, old people suck at technology.

118
00:16:30,937 --> 00:16:35,169
I land this fight, I promise you
Paris is not that far behind.

119
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:36,740
Let's not worry about Paris.

120
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,642
Let's just focus on getting
and winning this one.

121
00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:41,311
Yes, ma'am.

122
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:14,265
Fuck!

123
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,180
That's the guy they want you to fight?

124
00:18:57,516 --> 00:18:59,177
The white guy.

125
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:01,016
He's good.

126
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:04,721
He's a monster.

127
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,925
Sweetheart, what's the matter?

128
00:19:17,103 --> 00:19:18,400
You know,

129
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:22,232
I read you could earn
good money as a trainer.

130
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:29,579
Oh, Becky, I'm good at what I do.

131
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:33,243
Come here, let me show you something.

132
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:36,780
See this guy?

133
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:39,517
See how he only favors one side?

134
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:42,092
Right leg, right jab, boom, boom, boom.

135
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:45,956
Now, that's a weakness
his opponent is not exploiting.

136
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:49,299
He's not thinking long term.

137
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:50,865
And you do?

138
00:19:50,936 --> 00:19:52,062
You betcha.

139
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:54,436
Put me in a cage with this guy,

140
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:57,943
I'd take him out two rounds, easy.

141
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:02,172
- I'll tickle him to death.
- Okay. I get it, I get it.

142
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:04,779
You're a pro.

143
00:20:04,984 --> 00:20:06,246
Ready for your comeback.

144
00:20:07,286 --> 00:20:08,480
You betcha.

145
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:11,314
Okay.

146
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,456
Now can you use your superpowers to do
something about the wireless in this place?

147
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:19,521
I'm trying to upload the pictures,
but the signal keeps dropping.

148
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:22,328
Dad.

149
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:26,769
Yeah, go try the balcony.
You might get a better signal.

150
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:28,134
Okay.

151
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,174
All right, I'm going to take a shower.

152
00:20:30,242 --> 00:20:32,802
If it's not fixed when I come down,

153
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:35,037
I'll have them move us to a different room.

154
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:36,274
Okay.

155
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:37,508
Oh, and we need ice.

156
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:39,550
Mom said she'd get some,
but she passed out.

157
00:20:39,618 --> 00:20:41,142
All right, well, let her sleep.

158
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,744
We'll go downstairs
and get some later, okay?

159
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:43,811
Okay.

160
00:20:56,869 --> 00:21:00,532
- The signal here sucks.
- Oh, yeah.

161
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:08,009
It's best on the second floor,
near the ice machine.

162
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:12,483
Sorry I startled you. I'm Amalia.

163
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:16,347
Becky. Nice to meet you.

164
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,953
- You here on vacation?
- Sort of.

165
00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:25,692
- My dad's on a business trip.
- Let me guess.

166
00:21:26,665 --> 00:21:27,723
A lawyer?

167
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:30,461
He's a fighter, actually. MMA.

168
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,269
You're kidding me.

169
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:33,805
See, now that's cool.

170
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:36,971
It has its good days.

171
00:21:41,247 --> 00:21:44,239
Hey, princess, how'd it
go with the internet?

172
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:46,911
Becky?

173
00:21:48,888 --> 00:21:50,219
Becky?

174
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:05,402
Becky.

175
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:10,435
Becky.

176
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:25,356
What's wrong?

177
00:22:26,358 --> 00:22:28,588
Did you let her go out by herself?

178
00:22:29,194 --> 00:22:31,355
What? No.

179
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:42,740
You've reached Becky.
Tell me something good.

180
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:45,506
Becky, will you please
come back to the room?

181
00:22:45,578 --> 00:22:48,843
And call me on my cell
to let me know you got this.

182
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:52,476
- How long she been gone?
- I don't know, I was in the shower.

183
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:55,315
Ten minutes, less. She
knows not to do this.

184
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:58,714
She'll be back in a minute.
Is there an ice machine on this floor?

185
00:22:59,592 --> 00:23:02,652
I don't know. I'm gonna go look for her.

186
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:07,792
Call me if she comes back
so that I can kill her.

187
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:27,275
Excuse me. I'm looking for a 14-year-old
girl, about this high, blonde.

188
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,911
- You seen her?
- No.

189
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:32,020
Is everything all right?

190
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:35,483
Yeah, it's just my daughter.
She wandered off.

191
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:37,186
Is she missing?

192
00:23:37,262 --> 00:23:38,991
No, no, not really.

193
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,030
- Hi.
- Hi.

194
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:51,269
I'm in 846.

195
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:53,311
Has my daughter been down here?

196
00:23:53,379 --> 00:23:55,847
- 846, Mr. Fayden?
- Yeah.

197
00:23:56,649 --> 00:23:57,707
That's my daughter.

198
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,750
She was looking for ice.

199
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:02,082
I haven't seen her, sorry,
but there are some ice machines...

200
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:05,349
Yeah, I already checked those out.

201
00:24:05,424 --> 00:24:08,882
I'll ask my colleague.
I was busy with the ambulance. Sick guest.

202
00:24:08,994 --> 00:24:11,121
- Was that a girl?
- No, an older lady.

203
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:15,364
Mr. Fayden.

204
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:17,158
Is there a problem?

205
00:24:17,236 --> 00:24:18,703
Mr. Fayden is looking for his daughter.

206
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:21,567
When did you last see her?

207
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:24,701
About 30 minutes ago.

208
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:28,543
So, would you like me to call security?

209
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,949
Yes, yes, thank you.

210
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:43,355
Becky.

211
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:54,094
Becky!

212
00:24:55,574 --> 00:24:56,802
Becky.

213
00:24:57,209 --> 00:24:58,403
Becky.

214
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:01,338
Oh. Sorry.

215
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:25,332
What the hell?!

216
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,504
I'm looking for my daughter.
Have you seen her?

217
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:35,207
No. Sorry.

218
00:26:42,648 --> 00:26:43,876
In international news,

219
00:26:43,982 --> 00:26:46,450
the mysterious disappearance
of Becky Fayden,

220
00:26:46,552 --> 00:26:49,214
the daughter of former MMA champion
Andrew Fayden,

221
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:51,085
continues to stump police.

222
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:56,120
The 14-year-old American teen went missing
only a few hours after landing in Moldova

223
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:57,559
on August 31st,

224
00:26:57,629 --> 00:27:00,223
where her father was in talks
about a comeback fight

225
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:03,199
with European fight promoter
Roma Entertainment.

226
00:27:03,735 --> 00:27:06,727
At a press conference this morning,
Fayden and his wife Monica

227
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:09,864
made an impassioned plea
for their daughter's return.

228
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:16,177
We beg anyone with information on this case

229
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:18,876
to please come forward.

230
00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:24,945
My promoter has kindly offered
a $10,000 reward for anyone

231
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:28,692
with verifiable information
on Becky's whereabouts,

232
00:27:29,862 --> 00:27:34,856
and our friends and family
have generously doubled that offer.

233
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:38,962
Becky, if you're out there,

234
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:42,006
know that we're gonna find you.

235
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:46,340
And we're gonna bring you home. Thank you.

236
00:28:06,265 --> 00:28:07,391
We're closed.

237
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:14,305
We're not here to buy meat.

238
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:16,034
We're looking for...

239
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,670
Samson Gaul.

240
00:28:22,014 --> 00:28:23,345
He's dead.

241
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:29,412
Are you sure, 'cause they
just gave us this...

242
00:28:29,554 --> 00:28:32,284
The man you're looking
for is no longer here.

243
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,300
You were in the Legion.

244
00:28:44,303 --> 00:28:46,032
You're Samson Gaul.

245
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,807
Sorry, ma'am. I can't help you.

246
00:28:50,742 --> 00:28:52,141
Look, buddy,

247
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:56,277
I don't know what your problem is,
and I don't even care,

248
00:28:57,382 --> 00:28:59,680
we need your fucking help, man.

249
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:01,514
Our daughter is missing.

250
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,111
She's just a child.
The police say they found nothing.

251
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:08,284
The cops are your best bet.

252
00:29:13,699 --> 00:29:17,726
Money? You want some money?
'Cause, you know, look, that's okay.

253
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:20,203
It seems like everything else
in this country is for sale,

254
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:24,469
so is this enough motivation?

255
00:29:26,778 --> 00:29:30,236
The man from the American Embassy
suggested that we talk to you.

256
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:37,278
Do I look like the man who can help?

257
00:29:42,627 --> 00:29:46,358
Come on. It's a waste of time.

258
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:50,661
Mr. Gaul, please.

259
00:29:52,371 --> 00:29:55,863
We were told that you
were the best at this.

260
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:58,876
Look, if you want a steak, come to me.

261
00:30:00,645 --> 00:30:04,342
If you want to find your daughter,
go to the cops.

262
00:30:06,752 --> 00:30:09,346
Believe me, you're better without me.

263
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:08,445
The man from the embassy,
that would be you?

264
00:31:08,513 --> 00:31:10,105
Who else?

265
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:14,384
Since when do you babysit tourists?

266
00:31:14,453 --> 00:31:16,387
It's a small embassy. We all help out.

267
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:19,456
Look, these people need you, all right?

268
00:31:19,591 --> 00:31:22,025
The cops have nothing.
The raids do nothing.

269
00:31:22,094 --> 00:31:24,255
The real bad guys are protected.

270
00:31:24,563 --> 00:31:26,087
Your friend, the inspector?

271
00:31:26,164 --> 00:31:28,689
Well, let's just say he's got the finesse
of a bull in a china shop.

272
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:30,029
Why don't you dig around?

273
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:33,198
I'm a paper pusher with security clearance.

274
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:36,570
I don't have your flexibility
or your skill set.

275
00:31:37,843 --> 00:31:40,107
Sorry, I can't. You know I can't.

276
00:31:40,178 --> 00:31:42,146
The girl is 14 years old.

277
00:31:42,414 --> 00:31:44,746
It's been over 24 hours.

278
00:31:45,117 --> 00:31:47,813
Dad, she's running out of time.

279
00:31:47,886 --> 00:31:49,478
She needs you, all right?

280
00:31:49,888 --> 00:31:52,118
- Plus, you need this.
- I can't!

281
00:31:52,991 --> 00:31:56,358
- Stay out of it.
- Do you enjoy seeing dead people?

282
00:31:57,062 --> 00:31:59,530
Do you? Do you enjoy seeing dead people?

283
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:03,727
Hey, if I want bullshit psychology,
I'll call your mother.

284
00:32:05,137 --> 00:32:09,005
Well, if you don't help people anymore,
then all you are is a goddamn butcher.

285
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:11,901
Your grandpa was a butcher.

286
00:32:13,044 --> 00:32:14,671
People need meat.

287
00:34:41,593 --> 00:34:44,687
This girl, have you seen her?
She's my daughter.

288
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:49,424
My name is the right money.

289
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:15,050
You've seen her?

290
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:20,791
Thank you.

291
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:21,984
Hey, sweetie, you want to buy me a drink?

292
00:36:23,728 --> 00:36:26,891
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

293
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:31,767
Excuse me.

294
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,028
Yes?

295
00:36:34,906 --> 00:36:37,568
This girl, have you seen her?

296
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,034
Nope.

297
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:43,877
Are you sure? Take a better look.

298
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,447
The woman outside, the gypsy lady...

299
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:49,280
No such thing as gypsy lady.

300
00:36:49,387 --> 00:36:50,786
They're all whores.

301
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:53,856
- And thieves.
- Thieving whores.

302
00:36:57,228 --> 00:36:58,422
Sorry, I did not see her.

303
00:36:59,664 --> 00:37:03,100
Why would the lady outside
say that she saw her?

304
00:37:03,201 --> 00:37:06,659
Mister, that gypsy witch outside
has not been sober in three years.

305
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:11,567
Also, it's an easy mistake to make.
They all blondes here.

306
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:14,868
You see? Golden girls.

307
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:18,077
That's what we call the place.

308
00:37:25,523 --> 00:37:28,515
Have you seen her anywhere around here?

309
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:34,492
Wow. She is... How you say...

310
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,726
Hot.

311
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:39,027
Hot.

312
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:41,803
She's my daughter.

313
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,136
Why you let her come to a place like this?

314
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,702
I tell you, American economy, very bad.

315
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:53,175
Sending kids to make extra money.

316
00:37:53,985 --> 00:37:57,512
If your daughter come here,
you're not very good father.

317
00:38:02,293 --> 00:38:03,692
What'd you say to me?

318
00:38:07,398 --> 00:38:09,423
Come on, partner, time to go.

319
00:40:25,103 --> 00:40:26,502
Come on, I got you.

320
00:40:52,063 --> 00:40:53,690
How'd you find me?

321
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,994
Finding people, it's what I do.

322
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,462
Plus, it wasn't hard.

323
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:04,440
Not many Americans running around clubs,
pissing people off.

324
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:05,976
All right, so now you want to help?

325
00:41:10,515 --> 00:41:12,005
Are you sober?

326
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:16,448
Until I find your daughter.
Then, we'll see.

327
00:41:18,823 --> 00:41:20,882
Why'd you change your mind?

328
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:23,793
It's the right thing to do.

329
00:41:28,866 --> 00:41:30,561
One more thing, I work alone.

330
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:32,635
You're a good fighter...

331
00:41:32,904 --> 00:41:34,371
But you make lots of noise.

332
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:36,336
I can see you coming miles away.

333
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:38,939
What, and they can't see you?

334
00:41:40,078 --> 00:41:41,739
They never do.

335
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:49,413
We have a lead.

336
00:41:50,221 --> 00:41:53,281
Your daughter was most likely
taken out of the hotel in the ambulance

337
00:41:53,424 --> 00:41:57,224
that you saw when you
first ran down looking for her.

338
00:41:57,295 --> 00:41:58,922
They said it was an older lady.

339
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,725
They were either mistaken,

340
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:04,695
or the kidnappers dyed your daughter's hair

341
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:07,203
when they drugged her unconscious.

342
00:42:07,939 --> 00:42:09,338
We now know that

343
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:13,207
the guest listed as calling the ambulance
never actually stayed at the hotel.

344
00:42:13,745 --> 00:42:15,713
And you're just figuring this out now?

345
00:42:17,248 --> 00:42:19,239
It's been two days!

346
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:22,314
Mrs. Fayden, I share your frustration.

347
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:23,815
Do you?

348
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:28,450
Becky could be halfway
across the world by now.

349
00:42:29,494 --> 00:42:31,485
And no one's asked for a ransom.

350
00:42:31,662 --> 00:42:36,497
So the chances of this being a trafficking
case are 80 to 90% more likely!

351
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:40,330
Mrs. Fayden, the statistics on
the internet, they are not...

352
00:42:40,404 --> 00:42:45,637
The recovery rate for kidnapped children
after 24 hours drops to 46%!

353
00:42:46,677 --> 00:42:48,542
That's less than half!

354
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:52,714
Constantin, give us a moment.

355
00:43:02,994 --> 00:43:04,757
Mr. and Mrs. Fayden,

356
00:43:05,363 --> 00:43:08,298
let me, as you say, cut to the chase.

357
00:43:08,499 --> 00:43:11,434
I have learned you have hired
a private consultant.

358
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:14,066
Mr. Samson Gaul.

359
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,506
At this point, we can use
all the help we can get.

360
00:43:19,777 --> 00:43:23,543
- I would not place your trust in this man.
- Why?

361
00:43:23,981 --> 00:43:26,882
Because he might actually get some results?

362
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:29,085
Make you look bad?

363
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:31,152
He is not a detective.

364
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:35,288
He is an ex-mercenary. A hired killer.

365
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,852
Do you really want such a man
working for you?

366
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,925
I'll hire the goddamn devil himself
if it gets my daughter back.

367
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:49,871
I hope you do not come
to regret your decision.

368
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:54,372
His last recovery effort resulted
in the deaths of four girls.

369
00:43:55,213 --> 00:43:57,545
Two the same age as Becky.

370
00:43:58,082 --> 00:43:59,447
Two younger.

371
00:44:01,385 --> 00:44:05,446
Although we may not be moving
as quickly as you imagine we should,

372
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:07,517
I want you to know,

373
00:44:07,592 --> 00:44:12,154
it is my number one priority
to get your daughter back to you safely.

374
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:17,935
I just thought you should
have all the facts.

375
00:44:20,471 --> 00:44:23,167
Well, we'll take that under advisement.

376
00:44:24,275 --> 00:44:25,742
I understand.

377
00:44:26,844 --> 00:44:30,473
I will send someone to take you home.
I will call you later.

378
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,310
- Good evening.
- It's a little late for delivery.

379
00:45:08,486 --> 00:45:11,319
I know, but the overtime is worth it.

380
00:45:12,023 --> 00:45:13,047
Please.

381
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,791
Sign here.

382
00:45:58,903 --> 00:46:00,871
Guys. Keep your eyes open.

383
00:46:00,972 --> 00:46:03,634
Something's up with the monitors.

384
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:14,540
Stop!

385
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,582
Stop! Stop!

386
00:46:43,948 --> 00:46:45,415
Who's guarding the back?

387
00:46:53,124 --> 00:46:54,148
Up.

388
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:03,760
What the fuck?

389
00:47:03,868 --> 00:47:05,961
- Boss, come on, let's get you to the vault.
- Who are they?

390
00:47:06,037 --> 00:47:08,631
I don't know, but we can't
take any chances. Come on!

391
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:53,839
It's the fucking Russians! Gotta be.
Get more guys over here.

392
00:47:53,918 --> 00:47:55,283
Done.

393
00:48:21,879 --> 00:48:24,404
You may not feel it yet, but you will soon.

394
00:48:28,953 --> 00:48:33,788
It's a reminder of the most important
person in your life as of right now.

395
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:36,790
You know who I am?

396
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:40,786
That's why I'm here.
I want the man in charge.

397
00:48:46,637 --> 00:48:48,070
Where is she?

398
00:48:48,772 --> 00:48:50,296
American girl.

399
00:48:51,075 --> 00:48:54,044
- Not my thing.
- Then who?

400
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:56,179
I don't know.

401
00:48:56,981 --> 00:49:00,542
Never touch Americans. Bad for business.

402
00:49:00,751 --> 00:49:04,653
Fucking cops raiding my clubs for days now.

403
00:49:05,222 --> 00:49:06,280
Competition.

404
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:09,391
- Who wants to hurt you?
- Russians.

405
00:49:09,727 --> 00:49:11,217
Always trying to move in.

406
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:15,229
The only reason you're alive
is because you have a job to do.

407
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,159
- I told you...
- Shut up.

408
00:49:19,403 --> 00:49:21,030
You run the city.

409
00:49:21,705 --> 00:49:24,503
You find this girl as quickly as possible.

410
00:49:24,608 --> 00:49:28,009
And you bring her back to her parents
by this time tomorrow.

411
00:49:30,748 --> 00:49:35,583
If not, I'll come back here
and I'll carve out your eyes one by one.

412
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,919
Am I clear?

413
00:49:39,623 --> 00:49:40,715
Yeah.

414
00:50:09,453 --> 00:50:12,081
Your passport is proof of who you are.

415
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:15,417
You're no one now.

416
00:50:18,929 --> 00:50:22,092
I pay good money for you,
so now you work for me.

417
00:50:23,701 --> 00:50:24,929
Take it off.

418
00:50:28,505 --> 00:50:29,733
Everything.

419
00:50:40,484 --> 00:50:41,883
Is there a problem?

420
00:50:43,187 --> 00:50:44,950
Please. I can't.

421
00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:57,758
The next time you don't
do what you're told,

422
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:00,632
I take this knife...

423
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:21,385
You know the drill.

424
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:23,949
Test them out and put them to work.

425
00:51:30,301 --> 00:51:31,325
Da?

426
00:51:31,402 --> 00:51:35,600
Your retard cousin is drawing too much heat.
Shut him down.

427
00:51:35,673 --> 00:51:37,834
The Al Khabiri thing
could be worth millions.

428
00:51:38,142 --> 00:51:42,044
I've made up my mind.
It's not worth the risk.

429
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:46,245
Shut it down or I'll find
someone else who will.

430
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:07,730
Hello?

431
00:52:08,138 --> 00:52:11,073
It's me. I need a GPS
trace on a cell phone.

432
00:52:12,076 --> 00:52:14,306
That's not easy. I'll have to go into work.

433
00:52:14,378 --> 00:52:17,370
Okay, get moving
and I'll text you the number.

434
00:52:17,514 --> 00:52:22,611
I'll also need any information
on someone or something called Al Khabiri.

435
00:52:24,088 --> 00:52:26,249
Fine. Anything else, Dad?

436
00:52:26,357 --> 00:52:29,121
You want me back? This is me back.

437
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:21,343
What's going on?

438
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,277
Come on, what's going on?

439
00:53:27,584 --> 00:53:30,644
Change of plans, we're shutting down.

440
00:53:30,988 --> 00:53:32,080
What?

441
00:53:32,823 --> 00:53:35,986
- Bogdanov wants out.
- No! The money's too big.

442
00:53:36,193 --> 00:53:38,855
That old fuck's just too rich and scared
to follow through.

443
00:53:40,864 --> 00:53:43,094
- I see who's got the balls around here.
- Fuck off!

444
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:45,658
- You shut the fuck up.
- Who needs Bogdanov?

445
00:53:45,969 --> 00:53:49,769
We've got the merchandise.
A virgin. American blonde.

446
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,965
We have exactly what they wanted.

447
00:53:54,878 --> 00:53:56,778
You see this? It's our ticket.

448
00:53:57,214 --> 00:54:00,741
We call the guy. We make our own deal.

449
00:54:00,818 --> 00:54:02,183
Shut up.

450
00:54:02,252 --> 00:54:04,220
Do you want to be a lackey
for the rest of your life,

451
00:54:04,288 --> 00:54:06,518
or are you ready to make some real money?

452
00:54:15,399 --> 00:54:16,525
Tell you one thing, cousin,

453
00:54:18,335 --> 00:54:20,064
you sure got yourself a live one.

454
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:31,540
Stop, stop, stop!

455
00:54:35,052 --> 00:54:38,078
I told you, smart women are trouble.

456
00:54:39,189 --> 00:54:40,178
Please.

457
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:49,328
Now what do I tell your mother?

458
00:55:35,646 --> 00:55:36,704
Hold.

459
00:55:47,457 --> 00:55:49,049
Let him through.

460
00:55:53,463 --> 00:55:56,899
- The girl?
- Well, see for yourself.

461
00:56:02,472 --> 00:56:05,873
One of Bogdanov's recruiters
and his sometime girlfriend.

462
00:56:12,015 --> 00:56:13,243
In here.

463
00:56:28,332 --> 00:56:30,163
Her face is gone. You sure it's her?

464
00:56:30,267 --> 00:56:33,031
We're checking the DNA samples
from the parents.

465
00:56:41,244 --> 00:56:43,542
It's Bogdanov. He shut it down.

466
00:56:44,314 --> 00:56:46,509
I heard him giving the order.

467
00:56:48,051 --> 00:56:50,451
And you did not think to call us?

468
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:53,856
Of course not. Always the cowboy.

469
00:56:57,494 --> 00:57:00,019
Stick to what you know, butcher.

470
00:57:21,385 --> 00:57:24,081
Did the coordinates work? Was she here?

471
00:57:24,554 --> 00:57:25,680
Yeah.

472
00:57:47,177 --> 00:57:49,873
I just don't understand.

473
00:57:51,682 --> 00:57:52,671
Why would they...

474
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:58,420
I mean, if it is her...

475
00:58:00,624 --> 00:58:02,615
Why would they want to...

476
00:58:03,193 --> 00:58:04,888
it seems that whoever took her

477
00:58:05,028 --> 00:58:06,427
felt under pressure.

478
00:58:06,496 --> 00:58:09,329
Afraid that they're going to be found out.

479
00:58:11,134 --> 00:58:13,796
Someone pushed them too hard, I guess.

480
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:28,608
I'm sorry.

481
00:58:28,885 --> 00:58:32,446
The DNA match is positive. It's her.

482
00:59:30,714 --> 00:59:33,148
It's not your fault, Dad.
It's not your fault.

483
00:59:34,851 --> 00:59:36,512
Come on, let's go.

484
01:00:13,056 --> 01:00:16,685
- You can go. I'll be fine.
- I think it's better if I stay.

485
01:00:17,727 --> 01:00:18,955
You put me up to this.

486
01:00:19,863 --> 01:00:21,558
You knew I was no good!

487
01:00:22,699 --> 01:00:24,030
A girl is dead now!

488
01:00:24,901 --> 01:00:26,163

01:00:26,303 --> 01:00:28,168
