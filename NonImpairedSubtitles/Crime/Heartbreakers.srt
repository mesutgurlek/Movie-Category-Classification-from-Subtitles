1
01:51:41,852 --> 01:51:43,888
Do you, Angela Nardino,

2
01:51:44,052 --> 01:51:46,885
take Dean Cumanno
as your lawfully wedded husband,

3
01:51:47,052 --> 01:51:50,601
to love, honour and obey
till death do you part?

4
01:51:50,772 --> 01:51:52,125
I do.

5
01:52:11,292 --> 01:52:12,850
You happy, baby?

6
01:52:13,012 --> 01:52:15,446
I'm so happy. It's beautiful, Dean.

7
01:52:15,612 --> 01:52:17,523
It's everything I ever wanted.

8
01:52:17,692 --> 01:52:19,011
Yeah?

9
01:52:19,172 --> 01:52:22,130
Like the song says,
the best is yet to come.

10
01:52:22,292 --> 01:52:23,805
The honeymoon!

11
01:52:24,572 --> 01:52:28,929
Oh. You got a little bit of cake
right...

12
01:52:34,172 --> 01:52:36,766
I think we've put in
enough of an appearance here.

13
01:52:36,932 --> 01:52:38,490
Come on, let's go.

14
01:52:39,532 --> 01:52:43,684
It's tradition for the best man
to dance with the beautiful bride.

15
01:52:43,852 --> 01:52:47,049
- Piss off, Leo.
- You can't be rude to your friends.

16
01:52:47,212 --> 01:52:49,203
I'd love to dance, Leo.

17
01:52:51,852 --> 01:52:56,368
The best is yet to come
come the day you're mine.

18
01:52:58,252 --> 01:52:59,970
Come fly with me

19
01:53:00,132 --> 01:53:02,851
Let's fly, let's fly away

20
01:53:04,892 --> 01:53:06,723
Just say the words

21
01:53:06,892 --> 01:53:11,090
And we'll beat the birds
down to Acapulco Bay

22
01:53:11,772 --> 01:53:15,606
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon

23
01:53:16,732 --> 01:53:18,324
They say

24
01:53:18,492 --> 01:53:20,323
Come fly with me

25
01:53:20,492 --> 01:53:22,960
Let's fly, let's fly away.

26
01:53:23,132 --> 01:53:25,771
Congratulations, man. She's great.

27
01:53:26,332 --> 01:53:27,811
I love your friends.

28
01:53:27,972 --> 01:53:29,690
That's the busboy, honey.

29
01:53:31,452 --> 01:53:33,727
You even got me great busboys.

30
01:53:33,892 --> 01:53:37,441
Now, let's have one more dance
with the bride and groom...

31
01:53:42,492 --> 01:53:44,244
Are you still nervous?

32
01:53:44,412 --> 01:53:48,485
No. And, Dean, thank you
for respecting my religious beliefs.

33
01:53:48,652 --> 01:53:50,483
I'm really ready now.

34
01:53:50,652 --> 01:53:52,165
Thank you, God!

35
01:53:52,332 --> 01:53:56,484
I'm ready to do things to you
that no woman has ever done before.

36
01:53:56,652 --> 01:53:57,971
How about a...?

37
01:54:24,692 --> 01:54:26,410
Come on...

38
01:54:35,612 --> 01:54:37,489
Here it is.

39
01:54:37,652 --> 01:54:40,120
Oh, it's so...tasteful.

40
01:55:30,052 --> 01:55:31,405
Oh, my God!

41
01:55:31,572 --> 01:55:33,961
That's how much I love you, baby.

42
01:55:35,092 --> 01:55:37,970
You must love me...a lot.

43
01:55:52,092 --> 01:55:53,684
Take me, Dean.

44
01:55:58,372 --> 01:56:00,522
- Don't tease me.
- I'm not.

45
01:56:01,652 --> 01:56:03,961
I'm not a big fan of this material.

46
01:56:46,332 --> 01:56:47,811
Angela?

47
01:56:50,292 --> 01:56:51,771
Angela!

48
01:56:53,412 --> 01:56:55,528
Don't do this to me, Angela.

49
01:57:35,892 --> 01:57:37,644
Welcome back.

50
01:57:41,252 --> 01:57:44,164
Oh, my God. What happened?

51
01:57:44,532 --> 01:57:46,363
Not a whole hell of a lot.

52
01:57:46,532 --> 01:57:49,205
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

53
01:57:49,372 --> 01:57:51,010
Our wedding night?

54
01:57:52,132 --> 01:57:54,646
Oh. I am a bad wife.

55
01:57:54,812 --> 01:57:57,929
No. No. No, no, no.

56
01:57:58,092 --> 01:58:01,084
I got some frostbite
in some very weird places.

57
01:58:02,532 --> 01:58:04,648
You've got your whole life
to make it up to me.

58
01:58:04,812 --> 01:58:09,363
- And I'm gonna start right now.
- Yeah?

59
01:58:09,532 --> 01:58:10,851
OK.

60
01:58:15,852 --> 01:58:18,241
Oh, my God, I'm gonna be sick.

61
01:58:24,092 --> 01:58:25,764
Just give me a minute, baby.

62
01:58:25,932 --> 01:58:28,605
No, no, no! There's no rush.
No rush.

63
01:58:28,772 --> 01:58:32,242
I gotta stop by the office
before we leave for Barbados.

64
01:58:32,412 --> 01:58:33,811
You can freshen up.

65
01:58:33,972 --> 01:58:36,611
Just let me give you
a quick kiss goodbye.

66
01:58:36,772 --> 01:58:39,923
No, no, no, no! That's OK.
That's OK. I-I-I'm late.

67
01:58:40,092 --> 01:58:42,560
I'll see you in an hour, maybe two.

68
01:59:13,012 --> 01:59:14,445
What the...?!

69
01:59:14,612 --> 01:59:15,931
Nice security.

70
01:59:16,092 --> 01:59:18,890
Sorry, boss.
I went to bed late last night.

71
01:59:19,052 --> 01:59:21,646
But it's nothing compared to you,
huh?

72
01:59:21,812 --> 01:59:23,484
Yeah. Is the Mercedes ready?

73
01:59:23,652 --> 01:59:26,962
Yeah. Just about.
We switched the VIN and...

74
01:59:27,132 --> 01:59:29,600
Wendy's making the pink slip
for you to sign.

75
01:59:29,772 --> 01:59:31,967
That's a great wedding present,
boss.

76
01:59:32,132 --> 01:59:34,282
Angela's going to go nuts for it,
huh?

77
01:59:35,212 --> 01:59:38,124
Not as nuts as she was last night,
huh? Huh?

78
01:59:38,292 --> 01:59:40,601
Hey, boss, was she worth the wait?

79
01:59:40,772 --> 01:59:43,844
- Come on, boss...
- Hey! We're talking about my wife!

80
01:59:44,012 --> 01:59:47,448
A man's wedding night
is his own private sacred business.

81
01:59:47,612 --> 01:59:51,048
It's not to entertain lowlife scum
like yous guys.

82
01:59:54,652 --> 01:59:58,201
Angela's got to be an animal.
He's even walking funny.

83
02:00:00,332 --> 02:00:02,892
Hey, back to work.
Break is over, guys.

84
02:00:12,212 --> 02:00:14,806
Oh, congratulations, Mr C.

85
02:00:17,332 --> 02:00:19,084
I heard the wedding was awesome.

86
02:00:19,252 --> 02:00:21,846
I'm almost through
with the docs on the Mercedes.

87
02:00:22,012 --> 02:00:23,411
Thanks, Wendy.

88
02:00:30,092 --> 02:00:31,571
Oh, boy.

89
02:00:31,732 --> 02:00:33,051
Oh, boy.

90
02:00:41,132 --> 02:00:44,568
You need to sign here,
and I think...

91
02:00:46,612 --> 02:00:47,931
here.

92
02:00:49,612 --> 02:00:51,045
Is it hard?

93
02:00:51,892 --> 02:00:53,769
- What?
- Getting married.

94
02:00:53,932 --> 02:00:57,561
I haven't been here long, but I've
heard stories about you and women.

95
02:00:57,732 --> 02:01:00,041
Well, those days are all over,
Wendy.

96
02:01:01,212 --> 02:01:03,043
Forever. It's...

97
02:01:04,252 --> 02:01:05,810
Thank you.

98
02:01:08,412 --> 02:01:09,970
Damn it.

99
02:01:16,132 --> 02:01:17,929
Here, let me help you.

100
02:01:28,572 --> 02:01:29,925
- Mr Cumanno!
- I'm sorry!

101
02:01:30,092 --> 02:01:34,608
I'm so sorry, Wendy. I'm so sorry.
I'm just nuts today.

102
02:01:38,612 --> 02:01:42,446
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.
I'm married, Wendy. I can't.

103
02:01:42,612 --> 02:01:44,170
You're right. I'm sorry.

104
02:01:46,652 --> 02:01:48,085
Screw it.

105
02:01:57,332 --> 02:02:00,210
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. OK. OK.

106
02:02:02,372 --> 02:02:04,169
- Oh, my God.
- Thanks.

107
02:02:04,332 --> 02:02:06,243
- Is that frostbite?
- It's fine!

108
02:02:06,812 --> 02:02:08,291
Piss off!

109
02:02:08,452 --> 02:02:10,010
Baby, it's me.

110
02:02:11,492 --> 02:02:13,369
Shit! Get out. Take the back stairs.

111
02:02:13,532 --> 02:02:15,409
- My hair's stuck.
- What?!

112
02:02:17,092 --> 02:02:18,605
- Dean?
- Honey.

113
02:02:22,092 --> 02:02:26,131
I was feeling so much better,
I wanted to pick up where we left off.

114
02:02:26,292 --> 02:02:27,964
That's great. You know what?

115
02:02:28,132 --> 02:02:31,010
I'll finish here. I'll meet you
outside in a sex...sec.

116
02:02:31,172 --> 02:02:32,525
OK.

117
02:02:32,692 --> 02:02:34,011
I love you.

118
02:02:36,252 --> 02:02:37,685
I love you too.

119
02:02:39,292 --> 02:02:40,771
You look pretty.

120
02:02:44,132 --> 02:02:47,249
- Come on.
- Ow! Not so fast.

121
02:02:47,412 --> 02:02:49,403
- You are not welcome down there.
- I'm trying!

122
02:02:49,572 --> 02:02:52,166
I can't believe it.
Is that Mercedes for...?

123
02:02:54,372 --> 02:02:55,851
Dean.

124
02:02:56,012 --> 02:02:58,048
Honey, this isn't
what it looks like.

125
02:02:58,212 --> 02:03:01,921
I swear. Her hair got stuck in my
zipper. I wasn't getting nothing.

126
02:03:02,092 --> 02:03:06,563
17 hours! We have been married
17 hours!

127
02:03:06,732 --> 02:03:08,609
The happiest 17 hours of my life.

128
02:03:08,772 --> 02:03:11,650
You just lost the best thing
you never had!

129
02:03:13,972 --> 02:03:15,291
Angela, wait!

130
02:03:18,252 --> 02:03:20,846
She seems...nice.

131
02:03:21,012 --> 02:03:24,561
My client has agreed,
against my advice,

132
02:03:24,732 --> 02:03:27,200
to settle
for a one time cash payment.

133
02:03:32,132 --> 02:03:33,884
$300,000.

134
02:03:34,052 --> 02:03:35,610
For one day?

135
02:03:35,772 --> 02:03:38,730
One horribly traumatic day

136
02:03:38,892 --> 02:03:42,202
in which my client suffered
irreparable psychological damage

137
02:03:42,372 --> 02:03:43,851
to her self-esteem.

138
02:03:44,012 --> 02:03:46,128
Oh, and she keeps the Mercedes.

139
02:03:46,292 --> 02:03:48,123
- What?
- Bullshit.

140
02:03:50,012 --> 02:03:54,642
We can drag it before a judge if you
think that would be more favourable.

141
02:03:54,812 --> 02:03:57,849
That would put your client's
business under scrutiny.

142
02:03:58,012 --> 02:04:01,368
What was it again, Mr Cumanno?
Random repossessions?

143
02:04:05,372 --> 02:04:07,363
Give her what she wants.

144
02:04:53,852 --> 02:04:57,891
I can't believe you wore the grey
dress. I distinctly said the blue.

145
02:04:58,052 --> 02:05:00,486
- It worked, didn't it?
- You were lucky.

146
02:05:00,652 --> 02:05:02,210
I was good.

147
02:05:13,972 --> 02:05:18,011
Excuse me. I wonder if I could
ask your help for a moment.

148
02:05:18,172 --> 02:05:21,482
I'm trying to find Route 40.

149
02:05:21,652 --> 02:05:23,882
Route 40? Well, you're on it.

150
02:05:24,052 --> 02:05:25,371
- That's it.
- What?

151
02:05:25,532 --> 02:05:27,090
- Where is it?
- There.

152
02:05:27,332 --> 02:05:29,323
That black thing
with the lines on it.

153
02:05:29,492 --> 02:05:32,768
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know where it was.

154
02:05:32,932 --> 02:05:34,331
Thank you so much.

155
02:05:34,572 --> 02:05:36,847
- My pleasure.
- Sorry to trouble you.

156
02:05:41,612 --> 02:05:45,605
Forget it. You're not going to kill
yourself and stink up my new car.

157
02:05:45,772 --> 02:05:47,285
Our new car.

158
02:05:48,412 --> 02:05:50,164
Hey, Mom!

159
02:05:50,332 --> 02:05:53,210
I only do these things
because I love you, Page.

160
02:05:55,212 --> 02:05:56,725
How was the wedding?

161
02:05:56,892 --> 02:05:58,484
Beautiful.

162
02:05:58,652 --> 02:06:00,483
Like all my weddings.

163
02:06:09,332 --> 02:06:12,688
You have any idea what that meat
is doing to your arteries?

164
02:06:12,852 --> 02:06:16,003
Haven't you heard?
Cigarettes dissolve cholesterol.

165
02:06:20,692 --> 02:06:22,125
No cards, Page.

166
02:06:22,292 --> 02:06:24,806
- This is a classy place.
- It relaxes me.

167
02:06:26,812 --> 02:06:29,042
So? How did we do?

168
02:06:29,212 --> 02:06:30,725
Not too bad.

169
02:06:30,892 --> 02:06:34,362
- How not too bad?
- About 80.

170
02:06:34,532 --> 02:06:36,250
Plus the car.

171
02:06:37,612 --> 02:06:38,931
That's it?

172
02:06:39,092 --> 02:06:42,368
For that I lived four months
in a crap hotel without cable?

173
02:06:42,532 --> 02:06:45,046
I'm so sick
of this small-time bullshit.

174
02:06:45,212 --> 02:06:48,648
- I had to kiss that greasy mook.
- Dean wasn't so bad.

175
02:06:48,812 --> 02:06:52,851
Anyway, we'll make more in
the next one. I'm thinking Seattle.

176
02:06:53,012 --> 02:06:56,209
- Maybe San Francisco.
- Mom. Remember our deal.

177
02:06:56,372 --> 02:06:59,728
- This was it. I'm going solo.
- Here we go.

178
02:06:59,892 --> 02:07:03,726
It's happening, Mom. Accept it.
I am old enough to be on my own.

179
02:07:03,892 --> 02:07:06,281
You have no idea
what it's like to be all alone.

180
02:07:06,452 --> 02:07:08,204
I'll tell you what'll happen.

181
02:07:08,372 --> 02:07:10,283
You'll go off, you'll get lonely,

182
02:07:10,452 --> 02:07:12,966
some moron will come along,
you'll think it's true love,

183
02:07:13,132 --> 02:07:16,568
you've never been
so sure of anything, and then bam.

184
02:07:16,732 --> 02:07:19,963
He will pull a conceive and leave,
and then it's my life again.

185
02:07:20,132 --> 02:07:21,724
I am not that stupid.

186
02:07:25,412 --> 02:07:27,164
You know what I mean.

187
02:07:27,332 --> 02:07:31,371
Well, you're right. I was stupid,
and it left me pregnant and alone.

188
02:07:31,532 --> 02:07:33,523
If Barbara hadn't shown me
the con...

189
02:07:33,692 --> 02:07:36,252
And you taught me. OK? I'll be fine.

190
02:07:38,172 --> 02:07:39,969
OK. Fine.

191
02:07:40,132 --> 02:07:42,805
If you've made up your mind,
we will go to New York

192
02:07:42,972 --> 02:07:45,440
and divide up everything.
I'll get the cheque.

193
02:07:56,812 --> 02:07:58,723
Oh, my Lord!

194
02:08:00,412 --> 02:08:01,925
What seems to be the problem?

195
02:08:02,092 --> 02:08:06,324
Well, I was just about to take
a bite and I saw glass. Look!

196
02:08:06,492 --> 02:08:09,882
I am so sorry, ma'am.
This has never happened.

197
02:08:10,052 --> 02:08:12,725
Of course, your meal
is complimentary.

198
02:08:12,892 --> 02:08:15,008
Armand, a bottle of wine. Quickly.

199
02:08:15,172 --> 02:08:17,732
Perhaps a 69 Merlot?

200
02:08:27,372 --> 02:08:30,205
Those shoes are so wrong for this.

201
02:08:30,372 --> 02:08:32,488
Thanks.

202
02:08:32,652 --> 02:08:34,643
I don't understand the problem.

203
02:08:34,812 --> 02:08:38,122
We deposit our money and you
give it back when we say so.

204
02:08:38,292 --> 02:08:41,125
I'm afraid it's not that simple,
Ms Conners.

205
02:08:44,252 --> 02:08:47,608
Hello. I'm Gloria Vogal. IRS.

206
02:08:50,412 --> 02:08:51,731
Hello.

207
02:08:51,892 --> 02:08:56,363
Oh, you've heard of us. I'm surprised.
We seldom hear from you.

208
02:08:57,012 --> 02:09:00,800
Well, I suppose I might be a little
late with this year's return.

209
02:09:00,972 --> 02:09:02,724
Maybe even the last seven.

210
02:09:02,892 --> 02:09:05,042
Mother, I'm stunned.

211
02:09:05,212 --> 02:09:08,841
I had no idea you would evade
your responsibilities...

212
02:09:09,012 --> 02:09:12,721
Shut up, Ms Conners. We've never
seen a dime from you either.

213
02:09:12,892 --> 02:09:16,009
Look, I know
what must have happened.

214
02:09:16,172 --> 02:09:20,324
I always assumed that
my returns were filed by my husband.

215
02:09:20,492 --> 02:09:22,687
Oh. Which one?

216
02:09:22,852 --> 02:09:24,968
Look. Just because
I've had some trouble

217
02:09:25,132 --> 02:09:27,692
- with my personal relationships...
- Ms Conners...

218
02:09:27,852 --> 02:09:30,969
How you earn your money
is of no interest to the IRS.

219
02:09:31,132 --> 02:09:34,010
How can I put this in language
you'll understand?

220
02:09:34,772 --> 02:09:38,048
- We just want our cut.
- How much?

221
02:09:38,212 --> 02:09:40,567
With interest and penalties,

222
02:09:40,732 --> 02:09:43,963
the total comes to 247,811 dollars.

223
02:09:44,132 --> 02:09:45,451
What?!

224
02:09:50,212 --> 02:09:52,646
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

225
02:09:54,572 --> 02:09:58,008
That is in addition to what
used to be in your accounts.

226
02:09:58,172 --> 02:10:02,131
Your latest divorce settlement
arrived this morning. Thanks.

227
02:10:03,532 --> 02:10:05,602
But that's everything.

228
02:10:05,772 --> 02:10:09,128
It's not all bad. We'll give you
a full 90 days to pay.

229
02:10:09,292 --> 02:10:10,691
Or...

230
02:10:12,852 --> 02:10:15,127
we move forward
with criminal charges

231
02:10:15,292 --> 02:10:17,601
for felony tax evasion and fraud.

232
02:10:20,772 --> 02:10:22,683
Good luck.

233
02:10:27,132 --> 02:10:28,850
Here's the last of our cash.

234
02:10:29,012 --> 02:10:31,128
1,150...

235
02:10:31,292 --> 02:10:33,726
1,170...

236
02:10:34,372 --> 02:10:36,442
1,190.

237
02:10:36,612 --> 02:10:39,206
That's $1,300 each.

238
02:10:39,372 --> 02:10:41,932
Wow. Have a nice life with that,
princess.

239
02:10:42,092 --> 02:10:44,765
- I'll economise.
- Sure.

240
02:10:44,932 --> 02:10:47,287
You can do your own hair
and your own nails.

241
02:10:47,452 --> 02:10:50,410
They actually have some great shoes
at Wal-Mart.

242
02:10:51,772 --> 02:10:53,364
All right!

243
02:10:54,092 --> 02:10:57,323
One more con,
but only if we do it right.

244
02:10:57,492 --> 02:10:59,005
What does that mean?

245
02:10:59,172 --> 02:11:01,925
No more small-time crap.
It has to be big.

246
02:11:02,092 --> 02:11:05,528
One big final score to pay off
the IRS and set me up on my own.

247
02:11:05,692 --> 02:11:07,284
What are you talking about?

248
02:11:08,212 --> 02:11:09,531
Palm Beach.

249
02:11:09,692 --> 02:11:12,490
Palm Beach? Forget it!

250
02:11:12,652 --> 02:11:15,883
People that rich are already
suspicious. It's too hard to play.

251
02:11:16,052 --> 02:11:18,327
Palm Beach or nothing.

252
02:11:57,812 --> 02:12:00,406
Too expensive.
Let's find something else.

253
02:12:00,572 --> 02:12:02,210
I am home.

254
02:12:10,772 --> 02:12:13,411
What's the best way to get a room?

255
02:12:13,572 --> 02:12:16,006
I was thinking the Trogden Triangle.

256
02:12:16,172 --> 02:12:21,041
Right. But where are we going to
find a trumpet and a talking parrot?

257
02:12:21,212 --> 02:12:24,090
I was thinking something simple,
traditional.

258
02:12:24,532 --> 02:12:27,251
- The flopper diver.
- No way am I...

259
02:12:29,172 --> 02:12:32,164
Oh, my God!
She's cracked her head open!

260
02:12:32,332 --> 02:12:34,323
Oh, darling. Careful.

261
02:12:34,492 --> 02:12:36,608
You may be paralysed.

262
02:12:36,772 --> 02:12:40,162
Call a doctor.
Although I'm sure she'll be fine.

263
02:12:40,332 --> 02:12:41,731
Yeah. I think I'm...

264
02:12:54,772 --> 02:12:59,243
Just please let me know
if there's anything else we can do.

265
02:12:59,412 --> 02:13:02,085
You might consider
investing in a mop.

266
02:13:02,252 --> 02:13:04,004
Once again, I apologise.

267
02:13:04,172 --> 02:13:07,050
Since we seem to have lost
your reservation,

268
02:13:07,212 --> 02:13:09,282
we can let you have this suite
for one night.

269
02:13:12,252 --> 02:13:14,641
Then I'm sure we can work
something out.

270
02:13:14,812 --> 02:13:17,929
Could everyone please
just let her rest now?

271
02:13:28,772 --> 02:13:32,048
Don't you ever flop me
without my consent.

272
02:13:32,212 --> 02:13:35,761
It had to look real. You fall lousy
when you know it's coming.

273
02:13:35,932 --> 02:13:37,445
I fall fine.

274
02:13:38,292 --> 02:13:40,487
- Fake.
- Oh, shut up.

275
02:13:40,652 --> 02:13:42,051
No, don't do that.

276
02:13:43,412 --> 02:13:45,004
No! Stop!

277
02:13:46,332 --> 02:13:49,529
Hey, boss. Just got three Camrys in.
Cherry.

278
02:13:49,692 --> 02:13:51,728
Parts'll bring in a hundred thou,
easy.

279
02:13:51,892 --> 02:13:53,245
Great.

280
02:13:53,412 --> 02:13:57,325
The change of title came through
on the Mercedes. You have to sign.

281
02:14:01,172 --> 02:14:02,491
Bitch.

282
02:14:04,212 --> 02:14:05,531
You know...

283
02:14:06,572 --> 02:14:09,644
This is the eighth frame
we've gone through in a week.

284
02:14:09,812 --> 02:14:12,326
Maybe it's time
to retire this picture.

285
02:14:12,492 --> 02:14:14,847
Why can't I stop thinking about her?

286
02:14:15,012 --> 02:14:16,843
Was it the legs?

287
02:14:17,652 --> 02:14:20,485
- She had amazing legs.
- Give me that!

288
02:14:23,092 --> 02:14:25,811
Or maybe it was that she dumped you.

289
02:14:25,972 --> 02:14:28,202
'Cause that's never happened before.

290
02:14:29,292 --> 02:14:31,726
Yeah. Yeah.

291
02:14:32,772 --> 02:14:34,967
Who the hell does she think she is?

292
02:14:35,132 --> 02:14:38,647
Does she think she can do this
to me? Well, she's wrong!

293
02:14:38,812 --> 02:14:40,609
I'm going to find her.

294
02:14:40,772 --> 02:14:42,125
And then?

295
02:14:45,772 --> 02:14:47,888
Then I'm going to take care of it.

296
02:14:58,452 --> 02:15:00,727
Doctor Arnold Davis.

297
02:15:00,892 --> 02:15:04,487
Made huge money when an old uncle
died. 45. Pretty good shape.

298
02:15:06,172 --> 02:15:09,528
- Who's the old bag?
- His mom. She lives with him.

299
02:15:11,292 --> 02:15:13,760
Forget it. He's taken. Momma's boy.

300
02:15:13,932 --> 02:15:17,163
- We could get around her.
- Pass. Mothers are death.

301
02:15:17,332 --> 02:15:19,050
Can't argue that.

302
02:15:43,012 --> 02:15:45,082
David D Cummings.

303
02:15:45,252 --> 02:15:48,324
760 million. E-commerce stuff.

304
02:15:48,492 --> 02:15:50,642
Just ended marriage number three.

305
02:15:50,812 --> 02:15:52,370
The downside?

306
02:15:52,532 --> 02:15:54,727
Very big on iron-clad prenups,

307
02:15:54,892 --> 02:15:57,850
and, as you can see,
massive competition.

308
02:15:58,012 --> 02:15:59,570
We could handle 'em.

309
02:16:00,292 --> 02:16:02,203
We'd have to be into a group thing.

310
02:16:02,372 --> 02:16:03,851
Ménage à trois?

311
02:16:05,172 --> 02:16:07,163
Try ménage à cinque.

312
02:16:08,892 --> 02:16:10,644
Pass.

313
02:16:24,212 --> 02:16:27,124
William E Tensy.
CEO of Tensy Tobacco.

314
02:16:27,292 --> 02:16:29,567
Old money, but also just plain old.

315
02:16:32,332 --> 02:16:35,130
Go on! Get out!

316
02:16:35,292 --> 02:16:37,522
Goddamn! Go!

317
02:16:37,692 --> 02:16:40,968
- How much?
- Three billion. More every day.

318
02:16:41,132 --> 02:16:44,681
- Hmm...
- I am not dating the walking dead.

319
02:16:44,852 --> 02:16:49,209
The older the better. With luck,
they die right after the wedding.

320
02:16:53,172 --> 02:16:54,730
I'd have to kiss that?

321
02:16:54,892 --> 02:16:56,803
I'd have to kiss that more than you.

322
02:16:56,972 --> 02:16:59,042
Well, maybe you're into necrophilia.

323
02:17:02,652 --> 02:17:04,768
We'd better work fast.

324
02:17:09,012 --> 02:17:12,687
Why can't we pick someone
who's just a little bit cute?

325
02:17:12,852 --> 02:17:16,242
- Dean was kind of cute.
- You're in serious denial.

326
02:17:16,412 --> 02:17:18,289
Cute is dangerous.

327
02:17:18,452 --> 02:17:22,331
Cute leads to feeling, which leads
to screwing, which leads to screwed.

328
02:17:22,492 --> 02:17:25,450
I know we could make that doctor
and his mom work.

329
02:17:25,612 --> 02:17:27,204
We're doing Tensy. That's that.

330
02:17:27,372 --> 02:17:32,287
That is not that. If you want to
work Tensy, fine. I'm working Davis.

331
02:17:32,452 --> 02:17:35,922
Page, I've told you before,
no simultaneous cons.

332
02:17:36,092 --> 02:17:38,367
Too many angles.
They always go bad.

333
02:17:38,532 --> 02:17:41,649
- But it's not just that, is it?
- What?

334
02:17:41,812 --> 02:17:43,643
You don't think I can be primary.

335
02:17:43,812 --> 02:17:45,768
I didn't say that.

336
02:17:45,932 --> 02:17:49,049
Although it does take
an enormous amount of skill.

337
02:17:49,852 --> 02:17:52,764
I can make men do anything.

338
02:17:52,932 --> 02:17:55,571
Boys. You can make boys do anything.

339
02:17:55,732 --> 02:17:58,929
Gas station attendants, bartenders,
the odd migrant worker.

340
02:17:59,092 --> 02:18:01,560
A one-shot seduction is child's play

341
02:18:01,732 --> 02:18:04,405
compared to getting someone
to marry you in three months.

342
02:18:04,572 --> 02:18:06,927
- Four months.
- What?

343
02:18:08,172 --> 02:18:10,481
Well, it took you four months
this time.

344
02:18:10,652 --> 02:18:13,371
You used to be able to do it
in three.

345
02:18:13,532 --> 02:18:17,650
What are you saying? That I'm
losing it? That I'm getting too old?

346
02:18:17,812 --> 02:18:20,121
- I didn't say that.
- I'm in terrific shape.

347
02:18:20,292 --> 02:18:21,884
Feel my butt.

348
02:18:22,052 --> 02:18:26,170
I am not feeling your butt again,
Mother. We all know it's wonderful.

349
02:18:27,372 --> 02:18:30,284
Tell you what. We'll play for it.

350
02:18:30,452 --> 02:18:31,931
Winner picks the mark.

351
02:18:32,092 --> 02:18:34,447
Great. We'll cut cards.

352
02:18:34,612 --> 02:18:36,762
Right!
I'm going to trust your cards?

353
02:18:36,932 --> 02:18:38,888
See that guy over at the bar?

354
02:18:39,052 --> 02:18:42,408
First one to get him
to buy her a drink wins.

355
02:18:43,292 --> 02:18:44,611
Deal.

356
02:18:55,332 --> 02:18:57,084
Hot.

357
02:18:57,252 --> 02:18:58,890
Yeah. Sure is.

358
02:19:09,652 --> 02:19:12,450
Let me get that for you. Here we go.

359
02:19:13,692 --> 02:19:15,125
Oh, my.

360
02:19:16,292 --> 02:19:17,725
Would you?

361
02:19:18,372 --> 02:19:19,771
Sure.

362
02:19:22,652 --> 02:19:24,802
Oh, you're so kind.

363
02:19:25,732 --> 02:19:27,085
I'm Betty.

364
02:19:27,252 --> 02:19:29,368
- Hi. My name is...
- Excuse me.

365
02:19:29,892 --> 02:19:32,008
May I grab your nuts?

366
02:19:37,132 --> 02:19:38,770
Salty.

367
02:19:42,292 --> 02:19:44,647
Are you OK? Can I get you a drink?

368
02:19:44,812 --> 02:19:47,167
- We go with Tensy.
- Stupid jerk.

369
02:20:14,132 --> 02:20:16,566
He doesn't look so bad in this light.

370
02:20:16,732 --> 02:20:20,122
Oh, yeah. His liver spots
are positively glowing.

371
02:20:20,292 --> 02:20:23,204
- Let's run through it once more.
- I know what to do.

372
02:20:37,412 --> 02:20:38,811
Got a light?

373
02:20:38,972 --> 02:20:40,291
Yeah.

374
02:20:51,252 --> 02:20:52,651
Your trash is on fire.

375
02:20:53,892 --> 02:20:55,211
Holy shit!

376
02:21:28,532 --> 02:21:29,851
- Set.
- Good.

377
02:21:30,012 --> 02:21:32,207
Stay by the phone. Timing is crucial.

378
02:21:32,372 --> 02:21:35,284
Always treating me like a child.

379
02:21:35,452 --> 02:21:36,931
Child!

380
02:22:05,652 --> 02:22:09,691
Excuse me, sir,
but smoking is not permitted.

381
02:22:09,852 --> 02:22:11,570
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

382
02:22:15,132 --> 02:22:16,611
Nazi.

383
02:22:42,012 --> 02:22:43,331
Pardon me.

384
02:22:43,492 --> 02:22:45,289
Is no crime.

385
02:23:17,452 --> 02:23:20,967
OK, Doctor Davis. Let's see
where you're going tonight.

386
02:23:27,532 --> 02:23:28,851
Good start, Page.

387
02:23:37,412 --> 02:23:38,891
Crap!

388
02:23:49,132 --> 02:23:50,645
Davis residence.

389
02:23:50,812 --> 02:23:52,211
Arnold Davis, please.

390
02:23:52,372 --> 02:23:53,964
Sorry, he'sjust left.

391
02:23:54,132 --> 02:23:55,451
Oh, no. This is...

392
02:23:57,092 --> 02:23:59,811
He left me a message...
I'm supposed to meet him.

393
02:24:02,732 --> 02:24:04,051
Who is this?

394
02:24:04,212 --> 02:24:07,249
This is... Stupid cellphone.

395
02:24:08,012 --> 02:24:09,331
Mrs Wyler?

396
02:24:09,492 --> 02:24:11,801
Right. This is Mrs Wyler.

397
02:24:11,972 --> 02:24:15,567
I believe he said The Glades.

398
02:24:15,732 --> 02:24:17,051
And that's on...

399
02:24:17,212 --> 02:24:19,407
I think it's on the far end
of 0cean.

400
02:24:19,572 --> 02:24:21,085
Great. Cutting out. Thank...

401
02:25:00,692 --> 02:25:02,842
Hi, can I get you a drink?

402
02:25:03,012 --> 02:25:06,084
Wow, I've never heard that one
before.

403
02:25:06,492 --> 02:25:08,767
You've blown me away
with your creativity.

404
02:25:08,932 --> 02:25:10,445
- Well, I uh...
- ''Well, I uh...''

405
02:25:10,612 --> 02:25:12,807
Your recovery's even better.

406
02:25:12,972 --> 02:25:16,009
Do you even care at all who I am?

407
02:25:16,172 --> 02:25:19,687
I could be the anti-Christ or have
the intelligence of a thermos,

408
02:25:19,852 --> 02:25:22,446
but those are not the matters
the male penis ponders.

409
02:25:24,452 --> 02:25:26,283
So please tell me,

410
02:25:26,452 --> 02:25:29,808
why did you walk all the way over
here to ask to get me a drink?

411
02:25:30,932 --> 02:25:33,287
Well, because I'm the bartender.

412
02:25:37,932 --> 02:25:39,604
Martini. Very dry.

413
02:25:40,252 --> 02:25:41,651
Sure.

414
02:25:44,292 --> 02:25:47,170
Our next item is an exquisite piece
from the Kerner estate.

415
02:25:47,332 --> 02:25:50,290
A stunning work by Fyodor Turgenev

416
02:25:50,452 --> 02:25:53,649
entitled ''Form In Repose''.

417
02:25:54,612 --> 02:25:57,684
I'm looking for an opening bid
of 130,000.

418
02:25:58,252 --> 02:25:59,890
- 130!
- Very good.

419
02:26:00,052 --> 02:26:02,122
I have 130. Do I hear 140?

420
02:26:02,292 --> 02:26:03,611
140.

421
02:26:03,772 --> 02:26:05,808
Thank you. Do I hear 150?

422
02:26:05,972 --> 02:26:08,042
150,000.

423
02:26:10,252 --> 02:26:11,970
160.

424
02:26:12,132 --> 02:26:14,168
I am offer of 170.

425
02:26:15,652 --> 02:26:17,768
170...five.

426
02:26:17,932 --> 02:26:19,570
Was that 175, sir?

427
02:26:22,332 --> 02:26:25,210
I'll take that. 175,000.

428
02:26:26,692 --> 02:26:28,011
180.

429
02:26:28,172 --> 02:26:31,084
I have 180. Do I hear 190?

430
02:26:35,532 --> 02:26:36,851
Do I hear 190?

431
02:26:37,012 --> 02:26:39,845
I really must hear a number
or see a paddle, sir.

432
02:26:40,932 --> 02:26:43,446
- I think he...
- Yes, ma'am. I have your bid.

433
02:26:43,612 --> 02:26:45,807
It's to you at $180,000.

434
02:26:45,972 --> 02:26:48,532
Going once, twice...

435
02:26:48,932 --> 02:26:51,765
Sold to the persistent woman
on my right.

436
02:26:57,212 --> 02:27:00,249
Thanks. You did good. Bye.

437
02:27:00,412 --> 02:27:02,562
Er, that's 3.50.

438
02:27:03,092 --> 02:27:05,242
I'll flip you for it. Call it.

439
02:27:05,412 --> 02:27:07,243
- No. We don't really...
- Call it.

440
02:27:08,812 --> 02:27:10,131
Tails.

441
02:27:12,292 --> 02:27:14,726
Heads. Aw, too bad.

442
02:27:14,892 --> 02:27:16,291
Thanks.

443
02:27:22,812 --> 02:27:26,168
Wow, Jack. She got a free drink
and one of your balls.

444
02:27:26,332 --> 02:27:29,290
I just think she's nervous
being on her own.

445
02:27:34,012 --> 02:27:36,685
Yeah. She's a delicate flower.

446
02:28:00,532 --> 02:28:04,605
Oh, wait. I think I see crack.

447
02:28:05,172 --> 02:28:06,844
That's just his butt, lady.

448
02:28:07,012 --> 02:28:08,525
Let me see.

449
02:28:26,772 --> 02:28:28,490
Looks good.

450
02:28:28,652 --> 02:28:30,244
From where I'm standing.

451
02:28:51,132 --> 02:28:54,283
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

452
02:28:55,212 --> 02:28:57,442
What? What is the matter?

453
02:28:57,612 --> 02:29:00,001
My beautiful man. He ruined.

454
02:29:00,772 --> 02:29:02,091
Ruined!

455
02:29:02,252 --> 02:29:04,447
We can have this expertly repaired.

456
02:29:04,612 --> 02:29:07,410
No. Man thing off. Deal off.

457
02:29:07,572 --> 02:29:11,485
What good is to me now?
He has no...pipiska.

458
02:29:54,612 --> 02:29:57,410
Mother, did you have any trouble
finding the place?

459
02:29:57,572 --> 02:30:01,121
- This is beyond civilisation.
- Son of a bitch.

460
02:30:17,092 --> 02:30:19,242
- Ow!
- Oh! Oh, my baby!

461
02:30:19,412 --> 02:30:20,891
I am so sorry.

462
02:30:21,052 --> 02:30:22,485
Get away from him!

463
02:30:22,652 --> 02:30:25,883
I told you it was dangerous
to come to these low-class bars.

464
02:30:26,052 --> 02:30:28,441
It stings, Mother! It stings so bad!

465
02:30:28,612 --> 02:30:33,640
- Mother will help you.
- The retina is detached. I know it!

466
02:30:33,812 --> 02:30:35,404
Are you OK now?

467
02:30:35,572 --> 02:30:37,767
Yes, you idiot!

468
02:30:38,972 --> 02:30:40,291
Idi what?

469
02:30:43,812 --> 02:30:45,131
Yeah?

470
02:30:45,292 --> 02:30:48,841
Subject will pass the checkpoint
in ten minutes. Everything set?

471
02:30:49,012 --> 02:30:50,445
Yeah, of course.

472
02:30:50,612 --> 02:30:53,729
What's wrong, Page?
Mother can tell something's wrong.

473
02:30:53,892 --> 02:30:55,530
Mother knows nothing.

474
02:30:55,692 --> 02:30:59,162
I'm following right behind him,
so be sure to remove the spikes.

475
02:30:59,332 --> 02:31:02,165
And he mustn't see you,
so we can bond.

476
02:31:02,332 --> 02:31:04,448
I know. You're driving me crazy.

477
02:31:04,612 --> 02:31:06,125
You're driving me crazy.

478
02:31:06,292 --> 02:31:10,444
That answers the question of whether
you're already in a relationship.

479
02:31:10,612 --> 02:31:14,651
Since you can't seem to read
my subtle signals, I'll help you out.

480
02:31:14,812 --> 02:31:16,325
Piss off!

481
02:31:20,252 --> 02:31:22,891
Everyone's a little irritable
after they choke.

482
02:31:46,092 --> 02:31:47,923
Two headlights. That's not him.

483
02:31:59,492 --> 02:32:01,562
That was wrong on so many levels.

484
02:32:10,452 --> 02:32:11,771
You!

485
02:32:11,932 --> 02:32:14,321
- What happened?
- What are you doing here?

486
02:32:14,492 --> 02:32:16,847
- I followed you.
- More like stalked me.

487
02:32:17,012 --> 02:32:19,207
Listen, mouthbreather,
I am fully capable

488
02:32:19,372 --> 02:32:23,809
and really in the mood to kick
the shit out of your psychotic ass!

489
02:32:26,932 --> 02:32:28,968
Does this look familiar?

490
02:32:30,612 --> 02:32:31,965
Might be mine.

491
02:32:32,132 --> 02:32:34,043
Well, if you're not sure...

492
02:32:34,212 --> 02:32:36,089
Thanks. Now go.

493
02:32:36,252 --> 02:32:38,846
My car doesn't drive good
with a tree in it.

494
02:32:39,012 --> 02:32:41,128
What a baby. It's a flat.
I'll fix it.

495
02:32:41,292 --> 02:32:44,284
Wait. We'd better clear that stuff
out of the road.

496
02:32:44,452 --> 02:32:47,410
No. I'll do it. Just get the spare.
Now!

497
02:32:47,572 --> 02:32:51,247
Look, I'm willing to explore
the ''being dominated'' thing,

498
02:32:51,412 --> 02:32:52,925
but let's take it slow.

499
02:32:59,932 --> 02:33:01,604
- Uh-oh.
- Watch out!

500
02:33:12,012 --> 02:33:13,730
What did you push me for?

501
02:33:13,892 --> 02:33:15,405
I saved you, you moron.

502
02:33:28,692 --> 02:33:30,523
That can't be good.

503
02:33:30,692 --> 02:33:32,410
Wait, wait. I'm hurt.

504
02:33:32,572 --> 02:33:34,528
No, you're not.
Nothing could hurt you.

505
02:33:35,332 --> 02:33:37,084
Are you calling me a liar?

506
02:33:37,772 --> 02:33:39,364
Where are you hurt?

507
02:33:39,532 --> 02:33:40,851
My ankle.

508
02:33:41,852 --> 02:33:43,251
See?

509
02:33:49,692 --> 02:33:51,364
What the hell?

510
02:33:58,052 --> 02:33:59,371
Perfect.

511
02:34:03,812 --> 02:34:05,245
No!

512
02:34:11,572 --> 02:34:14,325
- They're really piling up...
- Oh, my ankle.

513
02:34:14,492 --> 02:34:16,483
Your ankle is fine. I'm going.

514
02:34:25,732 --> 02:34:27,290
Are you mixing medications?

515
02:34:27,452 --> 02:34:29,204
You're ruining the magic, idiot.

516
02:34:30,972 --> 02:34:32,849
I much sorry.

517
02:34:33,012 --> 02:34:36,084
Must be glass in road.

518
02:34:38,772 --> 02:34:40,444
Oh, the statue stealer.

519
02:34:40,612 --> 02:34:43,888
Whenever I see you, things seem
to be going into the crapper.

520
02:34:44,052 --> 02:34:46,930
You have head injury.
I rush you to hospital.

521
02:34:47,092 --> 02:34:48,411
No, no, no. I don't.

522
02:34:49,412 --> 02:34:50,891
I don't.

523
02:34:51,052 --> 02:34:54,931
The police will be along shortly
and they'll sort this out.

524
02:34:59,572 --> 02:35:03,167
See? Delayed shooting head pains.

525
02:35:03,332 --> 02:35:05,243
Come. To hospital we go.

526
02:35:06,292 --> 02:35:08,487
What about your car?
You have flat tyres.

527
02:35:08,652 --> 02:35:11,086
- Is nothing.
- Oh.

528
02:35:21,572 --> 02:35:23,608
What are you doing? Get off me.

529
02:35:23,772 --> 02:35:25,091
What?

530
02:35:25,252 --> 02:35:27,243
- You were the one...
- I gotta go.

531
02:35:37,052 --> 02:35:38,690
How do I look?

532
02:35:38,852 --> 02:35:41,002
If I were a guy, I'd do you.

533
02:35:41,172 --> 02:35:44,642
You're sweet.
I'm going back to the hospital

534
02:35:44,812 --> 02:35:47,372
to see if I can fix the mess
you made last night.

535
02:35:47,532 --> 02:35:49,727
With that on,
he'll forgive anything.

536
02:35:49,892 --> 02:35:51,610
He better, for your sake.

537
02:35:51,772 --> 02:35:54,525
Be nice or I won't tell you
which eye looks bigger.

538
02:35:55,692 --> 02:35:57,762
- Which?
- Are you gonna be nice?

539
02:35:57,932 --> 02:35:59,843
I'm always nice.

540
02:36:00,012 --> 02:36:02,207
The left. Here, use my eyeliner.

541
02:36:05,692 --> 02:36:07,171
Shit.

542
02:36:09,452 --> 02:36:11,488
I want my purse, jerk-off!

543
02:36:11,652 --> 02:36:13,529
That's not very friendly.

544
02:36:13,692 --> 02:36:18,083
Now, go back out and when you kick
the door open, say something nice.

545
02:36:18,252 --> 02:36:20,243
You stole my purse, dipshit,

546
02:36:20,412 --> 02:36:22,528
so I'd have to see
your ugly-ass face again.

547
02:36:22,692 --> 02:36:26,002
No. You forgot your purse
for the second time

548
02:36:26,172 --> 02:36:29,289
because you were in such a hurry
to leave me stranded.

549
02:36:29,452 --> 02:36:32,603
Give it to me. Or would you rather
have my heel up your ass?

550
02:36:32,772 --> 02:36:34,649
Who told you I'm into that?

551
02:36:38,652 --> 02:36:40,370
Pretty rough on the boss.

552
02:36:40,532 --> 02:36:43,968
He's not really into ass play.
That's just his sense of humour.

553
02:36:44,412 --> 02:36:46,164
He owns this place?

554
02:36:46,332 --> 02:36:48,482
Yeah. His dad left it to him.

555
02:36:48,652 --> 02:36:52,440
These development creeps are trying
to give him three mil for the place.

556
02:36:52,612 --> 02:36:55,046
Whole world's gonna be
Gaps and Starbucks.

557
02:36:57,892 --> 02:37:00,690
He's loaded. Good, Page.

558
02:37:06,292 --> 02:37:07,611
Greetings.

559
02:37:10,372 --> 02:37:11,930
Oh, it's you.

560
02:37:12,092 --> 02:37:15,289
Doctors don't want me to smoke.
It's ridiculous.

561
02:37:15,452 --> 02:37:17,488
They depend on cigarettes.

562
02:37:17,652 --> 02:37:20,405
They're a perfect scapegoat
for their incompetence.

563
02:37:20,572 --> 02:37:23,689
You're here about the insurance.
My attorneys will take care...

564
02:37:23,852 --> 02:37:26,924
That won't be necessary.
I have no want to sue you.

565
02:37:27,092 --> 02:37:29,765
Sue me? My people will tear you
a new heinie.

566
02:37:29,932 --> 02:37:34,608
I am only come to see how you feel.

567
02:37:36,132 --> 02:37:37,451
My poor...

568
02:37:37,972 --> 02:37:39,291
poor...

569
02:37:39,452 --> 02:37:41,010
babushka.

570
02:37:44,612 --> 02:37:46,762
That's very nice of you, Mrs er...

571
02:37:46,932 --> 02:37:49,730
Miss. Just call me...

572
02:37:51,372 --> 02:37:52,930
Ulga.

573
02:37:54,252 --> 02:37:56,049
- Ulga?
- Mmm.

574
02:37:57,452 --> 02:37:59,727
Well, that's lovely, Ulga.

575
02:38:28,412 --> 02:38:29,731
Yes?

576
02:38:29,892 --> 02:38:33,726
- I am Ulga Yevanova. I am here...
- Yes.

577
02:38:33,892 --> 02:38:35,211
We've been expecting you.

578
02:38:36,012 --> 02:38:40,244
I am Miss Madress.
I run this household.

579
02:38:40,412 --> 02:38:43,290
Oh, good for you.

580
02:38:43,452 --> 02:38:44,805
I will announce you.

581
02:38:48,532 --> 02:38:50,284
We have a bitch alert.

582
02:38:55,092 --> 02:38:59,722
Come on, bartender, it's your
night off. Do something fun.

583
02:39:03,892 --> 02:39:05,610
Good boy.

584
02:39:26,852 --> 02:39:28,524
I love it here.

585
02:39:28,692 --> 02:39:30,410
It's the only bloody place left

586
02:39:30,572 --> 02:39:33,723
that doesn't make you feel
like a killer for having a smoke.

587
02:39:33,892 --> 02:39:35,530
Yes. Is lovely.

588
02:39:36,532 --> 02:39:37,885
Dobriy vecher.

589
02:39:38,052 --> 02:39:40,327
I'll be your waiter tonight -
Vladimir.

590
02:39:40,492 --> 02:39:42,767
Allow me to tell you
tonight's specials.

591
02:39:42,932 --> 02:39:46,368
No need for English. We have
one of your countrywomen here.

592
02:39:46,532 --> 02:39:47,851
Oh, wonderful.

593
02:39:49,772 --> 02:39:52,445
So tonight we have
cutleta po kievsky.

594
02:39:53,532 --> 02:39:55,921
- Da.
- Bifstek potatarsky.

595
02:39:56,092 --> 02:39:57,491
Da. Da.

596
02:39:57,652 --> 02:39:59,643
E adibris dilatina.

597
02:40:00,332 --> 02:40:01,651
Oh.

598
02:40:01,812 --> 02:40:03,325
Dilatina.

599
02:40:03,492 --> 02:40:05,687
Excellent choice. The steak tartare.

600
02:40:05,852 --> 02:40:09,128
Oh, I love a woman
who eats raw meat.

601
02:40:31,492 --> 02:40:34,325
Oh. That's real nice.

602
02:40:43,972 --> 02:40:46,770
You're not just going
to stand there? Help me.

603
02:40:46,932 --> 02:40:48,365
Please.

604
02:40:48,532 --> 02:40:52,525
Isn't that the shoe
you wanted to jam up my ass?

605
02:40:52,692 --> 02:40:56,571
No. That was the six-inch heel.
Now come on.

606
02:40:56,732 --> 02:40:58,643
What are you doing here?

607
02:41:00,532 --> 02:41:02,011
Working.

608
02:41:02,172 --> 02:41:03,571
Working?

609
02:41:03,732 --> 02:41:06,530
You some kind of wilderness
female mud wrestler?

610
02:41:06,692 --> 02:41:10,401
I'm an environmentalist
studying the effect of waste run-off

611
02:41:10,572 --> 02:41:12,244
in the neighbouring wetlands.

612
02:41:12,412 --> 02:41:14,687
Oh. Well...

613
02:41:14,852 --> 02:41:18,003
you environmentalists
really dress hot.

614
02:41:18,172 --> 02:41:22,484
There's no law to say you can't
look good while you're saving stuff.

615
02:41:22,652 --> 02:41:24,563
So why are you following me?

616
02:41:24,732 --> 02:41:27,849
- I'm not following you!
- Then what are you doing here?

617
02:41:29,052 --> 02:41:30,883
Come on. I'll show you.

618
02:41:31,292 --> 02:41:34,967
You're not out here burying
high school kids, are you?

619
02:41:36,012 --> 02:41:38,003
Well, they egged my car.

620
02:41:48,012 --> 02:41:52,164
What do you do? Spy on people
humping in boats? That's perverted.

621
02:41:52,332 --> 02:41:54,243
I photograph stars.

622
02:41:54,412 --> 02:41:58,769
Just because they're famous doesn't
mean they don't deserve privacy too.

623
02:41:58,932 --> 02:42:00,445
Who you got?

624
02:42:01,492 --> 02:42:03,642
The stars up there.

625
02:42:04,812 --> 02:42:07,770
You sneak way out here
to stare at space and shit?

626
02:42:07,932 --> 02:42:11,561
No. I come here to get away
from the lights of the city,

627
02:42:11,732 --> 02:42:14,804
so I can see the space and shit.

628
02:42:16,972 --> 02:42:19,008
- Why?
- Take a look.

629
02:42:25,052 --> 02:42:26,371
Jesus.

630
02:42:26,932 --> 02:42:28,650
That's the Crab Nebula.

631
02:42:28,812 --> 02:42:31,770
That is the exact colour
of a sapphire ring I've wanted.

632
02:42:32,852 --> 02:42:34,171
OK.

633
02:42:35,812 --> 02:42:37,723
And this...

634
02:42:38,052 --> 02:42:41,010
is the Great Globular Cluster
in Hercules.

635
02:42:41,172 --> 02:42:43,163
I don't think I want to see that.

636
02:42:47,212 --> 02:42:48,531
Wow.

637
02:42:48,692 --> 02:42:50,205
Good cluster.

638
02:42:50,372 --> 02:42:54,365
And I think you can also see
the Corona Borealis tonight.

639
02:42:54,532 --> 02:42:57,126
Wait, wait. I'm not done
with the globular thing.

640
02:43:00,292 --> 02:43:01,771
OK.

641
02:43:25,972 --> 02:43:27,849
I love to watch a woman eat.

642
02:43:28,012 --> 02:43:31,368
It is surely
one of the most sensual acts.

643
02:43:37,332 --> 02:43:38,685
Da.

644
02:43:46,132 --> 02:43:47,804
Da. Da.

645
02:43:54,652 --> 02:43:56,051
- Da.
- Da?

646
02:43:57,212 --> 02:44:00,648
Is such joy to hear
my native tongue again.

647
02:44:00,812 --> 02:44:03,804
I deeply appreciate what you say

648
02:44:03,972 --> 02:44:05,291
and er...

649
02:44:06,932 --> 02:44:08,490
what you don't say.

650
02:44:12,892 --> 02:44:16,441
Oh, William. So much loudness.

651
02:44:16,612 --> 02:44:20,446
Can we not go somewhere
I can relate to you...

652
02:44:21,812 --> 02:44:23,131
orally?

653
02:44:25,732 --> 02:44:29,850
All right! Who will favour us
with next song?

654
02:44:34,492 --> 02:44:36,483
We have a fellow countrywoman here!

655
02:44:36,652 --> 02:44:38,643
Oh, no, I am so...

656
02:44:39,772 --> 02:44:42,570
Please, I am so not musical.

657
02:44:44,292 --> 02:44:46,601
- Please...
- How about Karabushka?

658
02:44:46,772 --> 02:44:50,401
There isn't a Russian alive
who doesn't know Karabushka!

659
02:45:01,132 --> 02:45:02,485
Da, da

660
02:45:02,652 --> 02:45:05,803
Karabuschka

661
02:45:05,972 --> 02:45:07,291
Da, da

662
02:45:07,452 --> 02:45:09,727
Da, da...

663
02:45:10,172 --> 02:45:14,006
Aah... Moscow

664
02:45:14,812 --> 02:45:17,042
Da, da... Leningrad

665
02:45:18,452 --> 02:45:21,250
Er, Minsk and...

666
02:45:21,412 --> 02:45:23,368
Oh, you know...

667
02:45:24,332 --> 02:45:26,004
I am just fooling.

668
02:45:26,172 --> 02:45:29,881
I am so full of good humour.

669
02:45:44,532 --> 02:45:48,366
Flew in from Miami Beach

670
02:45:48,532 --> 02:45:50,887
B-0-A-C

671
02:45:51,052 --> 02:45:53,646
Didn't get to bed last night

672
02:45:56,052 --> 02:46:01,001
0n the way the paper bag
was on my knee

673
02:46:01,692 --> 02:46:04,570
Man, I had a dreadful flight

674
02:46:04,732 --> 02:46:06,450
I'm back in the USSR

675
02:46:08,412 --> 02:46:11,165
You don't know how lucky you are,
boy

676
02:46:11,332 --> 02:46:13,243
Back in the USSR

677
02:46:16,092 --> 02:46:19,323
Been away so long
I hardly knew the place

678
02:46:19,492 --> 02:46:21,528
Gee, it's good to be back home

679
02:46:23,052 --> 02:46:25,805
Leave it to tomorrow
to unpack my case

680
02:46:25,972 --> 02:46:28,122
Honey, disconnect the phone

681
02:46:28,292 --> 02:46:29,691
I'm back in the USSR

682
02:46:31,332 --> 02:46:34,324
You don't know how lucky you are,
boy

683
02:46:34,492 --> 02:46:37,928
Back in the US, back in the US
Back in the USSR...

684
02:46:41,052 --> 02:46:42,883
Look, there's another one.

685
02:46:44,612 --> 02:46:46,762
There's two at once.
Did you see that?

686
02:46:46,932 --> 02:46:50,891
Yeah. God, I never knew you could
have this much fun for free.

687
02:46:52,892 --> 02:46:55,770
Well, it's not completely free.

688
02:47:01,052 --> 02:47:03,885
So are you ready
to tell me the truth?

689
02:47:05,452 --> 02:47:06,805
What?

690
02:47:06,972 --> 02:47:08,963
Tell me why you're here really.

691
02:47:10,052 --> 02:47:12,725
I told you.
I'm an environmentalist...

692
02:47:13,732 --> 02:47:16,200
student at the University of Miami.

693
02:47:16,372 --> 02:47:18,283
What, you don't believe me?

694
02:47:19,492 --> 02:47:21,244
Well, I'd like to, but...

695
02:47:21,412 --> 02:47:23,164
What about my butt?

696
02:47:25,932 --> 02:47:27,411
Oh, I gotta go.

697
02:47:27,572 --> 02:47:29,403
- Again?
- Yeah. I have work to do.

698
02:47:29,572 --> 02:47:31,403
It's eleven o'clock at night.

699
02:47:31,572 --> 02:47:34,040
I have to write
an environmental impact report.

700
02:47:34,212 --> 02:47:35,850
Will it mention me?

701
02:47:37,172 --> 02:47:39,003
- Wait! What's your name?
- Jane.

702
02:47:39,172 --> 02:47:42,164
- Will I see you again?
- Try wishing on a star!

703
02:47:50,692 --> 02:47:52,683
Is that five people?

704
02:47:59,372 --> 02:48:01,044
Keys are in it.

705
02:48:20,012 --> 02:48:22,082
Hey, Mom. How did it go?

706
02:48:22,332 --> 02:48:24,004
Perfect.

707
02:48:25,732 --> 02:48:29,850
His infatuation
is right on schedule.

708
02:48:30,012 --> 02:48:32,572
You're home now.
You could stop with the accent.

709
02:48:33,492 --> 02:48:34,891
What's that?

710
02:48:35,052 --> 02:48:36,405
What's what?

711
02:48:38,252 --> 02:48:39,571
Mud?

712
02:48:39,732 --> 02:48:43,645
I gave myself a facial.
Some special local stuff.

713
02:48:44,972 --> 02:48:47,964
I think I'm gonna take a nice
long shower and go to bed.

714
02:49:03,132 --> 02:49:05,930
Smoking is part of the fun
of being a kid.

715
02:49:06,092 --> 02:49:09,209
Yeah. We just did some tests
on some nine-year-olds.

716
02:49:09,372 --> 02:49:12,967
After a little puking, you couldn't
drag them away from the stuff.

717
02:49:14,372 --> 02:49:17,603
You're only young once.
Why not indulge them, I say.

718
02:49:18,092 --> 02:49:21,209
- Ooh!
- Oh, darling. What matter?

719
02:49:21,372 --> 02:49:23,602
Head pain back again?

720
02:49:23,772 --> 02:49:25,649
No, no, no. It's all right.

721
02:49:27,252 --> 02:49:28,571
Ulga.

722
02:49:28,732 --> 02:49:30,085
Ulga?

723
02:49:35,292 --> 02:49:37,044
I have a gift for you.

724
02:49:37,212 --> 02:49:38,884
A gift?

725
02:49:40,892 --> 02:49:43,486
A gift! Oh!

726
02:49:50,452 --> 02:49:54,206
A personal fire device.

727
02:49:54,692 --> 02:49:56,808
I'm not insisting
you take up smoking,

728
02:49:56,972 --> 02:49:59,691
but I thought it would
give you some incentive.

729
02:49:59,852 --> 02:50:03,811
There is nothing sexier
than smoke billowing proudly

730
02:50:03,972 --> 02:50:07,408
out of a woman's hot, red...

731
02:50:08,132 --> 02:50:09,963
engorged nostrils.

732
02:50:12,492 --> 02:50:15,882
That image will haunt me.

733
02:50:16,852 --> 02:50:19,286
- Still a little sleepy, my dear?
- Oh, no.

734
02:50:19,452 --> 02:50:22,569
No. It was another wonderful night.

735
02:50:24,292 --> 02:50:28,490
I think that I deserve a big kiss
for that big gift.

736
02:50:29,332 --> 02:50:31,368
Oh, yes.

737
02:50:31,532 --> 02:50:33,887
Is no getting around that.

738
02:50:42,772 --> 02:50:44,683
Oh, no, we mustn't.

739
02:50:45,772 --> 02:50:48,127
God is everywhere.

740
02:50:49,052 --> 02:50:50,883
Yes, he is, isn't he?

741
02:50:51,772 --> 02:50:53,205
Nosy bastard.

742
02:50:54,172 --> 02:50:57,403
I'll have Miss Madress
get your purse.

743
02:51:05,092 --> 02:51:07,128
Is he that repulsive to you?

744
02:51:09,972 --> 02:51:12,088
No. Is er...

745
02:51:12,252 --> 02:51:14,561
a Russian expression of happiness.

746
02:51:14,732 --> 02:51:17,292
Poy, poy, oy, I'm so happy.

747
02:51:17,452 --> 02:51:19,841
Save it. I'm on to you.

748
02:51:21,252 --> 02:51:23,402
You are attracted to me?

749
02:51:23,572 --> 02:51:26,405
Oh, flattering, but I no do females.

750
02:51:26,572 --> 02:51:28,927
I've been with him for seven years.

751
02:51:29,092 --> 02:51:30,889
I've seen him with many women.

752
02:51:31,052 --> 02:51:34,010
I've never worried.
Passing amusements.

753
02:51:34,172 --> 02:51:37,050
But you. Oh, you're good, baby.

754
02:51:38,092 --> 02:51:40,845
I no understand. What is you want?

755
02:51:41,012 --> 02:51:45,927
I is want your ex-commie ass
out of his life.

756
02:51:46,092 --> 02:51:50,165
I didn't put up with his crap just
to be squeezed out before he kicks.

757
02:51:50,332 --> 02:51:51,924
I expect a big pay-off!

758
02:51:53,612 --> 02:51:57,525
You must believe.
I have true feelings for him.

759
02:51:57,692 --> 02:52:00,729
Oh, spare me
your Bolshevik bullshit.

760
02:52:00,892 --> 02:52:04,282
Either you disappear
or I tell him exactly what I saw.

761
02:52:05,452 --> 02:52:08,330
Your dark honesty is refreshing.

762
02:52:08,492 --> 02:52:10,528
But please, I beg you,

763
02:52:10,692 --> 02:52:14,446
leave me one more night
to bow out gracefully.

764
02:52:28,252 --> 02:52:30,129
I have something for you.

765
02:52:36,372 --> 02:52:40,081
I know it's not the sapphire
you wanted, but...

766
02:52:40,252 --> 02:52:42,208
It sure isn't.

767
02:52:42,972 --> 02:52:46,601
- It's a meteor fragment.
- Like the ones we were watching?

768
02:52:46,772 --> 02:52:49,605
That's been to the far reaches
of our solar system.

769
02:52:49,772 --> 02:52:52,047
No lousy sapphire's
ever pulled that off.

770
02:52:54,132 --> 02:52:57,363
You don't do anything
like normal people, do you?

771
02:52:57,532 --> 02:52:59,011
Some things.

772
02:53:42,172 --> 02:53:45,482
Kitchen's through there,
master bedroom's upstairs,

773
02:53:45,652 --> 02:53:48,485
her room is down the hall.
You have seven minutes.

774
02:53:48,652 --> 02:53:51,120
Here you go.
The thing that's screwing us

775
02:53:51,292 --> 02:53:53,567
is all this second-hand smoke
nonsense.

776
02:53:54,932 --> 02:53:58,447
They've convicted the tobacco
companies without any evidence.

777
02:54:00,612 --> 02:54:03,524
Hmm. Is oddness.

778
02:54:03,692 --> 02:54:05,330
What?

779
02:54:06,372 --> 02:54:09,489
Costly lighter gift you gave
is missing.

780
02:54:09,652 --> 02:54:11,688
You must have left it somewhere.

781
02:54:11,852 --> 02:54:14,605
Never. I cherish too much.

782
02:54:14,772 --> 02:54:16,091
Perhaps...

783
02:54:18,132 --> 02:54:19,611
No.

784
02:54:19,772 --> 02:54:23,048
Is inconceivablish.

785
02:54:23,212 --> 02:54:24,850
What is inconceivablish?

786
02:54:26,132 --> 02:54:29,568
Well, your housekeeper
did much admire,

787
02:54:29,732 --> 02:54:33,122
and when she gave me purse
to leave yesterday,

788
02:54:33,292 --> 02:54:35,886
was open.

789
02:54:37,092 --> 02:54:40,971
Sir, I would never take so much
as a hairpin from this household.

790
02:54:42,292 --> 02:54:46,843
Is this not clothing you wear
yesterday when you see me out?

791
02:54:48,692 --> 02:54:50,011
Hello.

792
02:54:51,292 --> 02:54:53,362
No. She set me up.

793
02:54:53,532 --> 02:54:56,604
She could have slipped that
into my pocket any time.

794
02:54:59,892 --> 02:55:01,769
You doubt me?

795
02:55:02,612 --> 02:55:04,284
Oh, William.

796
02:55:11,212 --> 02:55:14,363
Oh! How you can sleep on
so lumpy a...

797
02:55:16,532 --> 02:55:17,885
My wife's old jewellery!

798
02:55:18,052 --> 02:55:21,488
Why are you stealing
from loyal, kind employer man?

799
02:55:21,652 --> 02:55:24,371
No! It's her! Can't you see?

800
02:55:24,532 --> 02:55:26,568
You bitch!

801
02:55:32,372 --> 02:55:33,964
My cigarettes!

802
02:55:34,132 --> 02:55:36,168
I feel like vomiting!

803
02:55:36,332 --> 02:55:39,165
Oh, please, Mr Tensy!

804
02:55:40,452 --> 02:55:44,206
I have been a dedicated and
trustworthy servant for seven years.

805
02:55:44,372 --> 02:55:46,647
Look into my eyes.

806
02:55:46,812 --> 02:55:50,168
You must believe in my complete
and total innocence.

807
02:56:02,172 --> 02:56:06,563
If it's at all possible...could you
slap her around a little bit?

808
02:56:09,212 --> 02:56:12,090
Very good, darling.
You're doing better.

809
02:56:12,252 --> 02:56:15,085
Come on, let's hear a little pain.

810
02:56:16,732 --> 02:56:20,486
I've set you up with an interview
with Tensy tomorrow.

811
02:56:20,652 --> 02:56:22,529
Tomorrow? That's Saturday.

812
02:56:22,692 --> 02:56:26,446
- There are no weekends in conning.
- I'll go first thing Monday.

813
02:56:26,612 --> 02:56:30,321
No. We can't take the chance
of someone else getting that job.

814
02:56:30,492 --> 02:56:32,369
You have to get close to him.

815
02:56:32,532 --> 02:56:34,762
He's days away
from popping the question.

816
02:56:34,932 --> 02:56:37,924
No way. You couldn't
have gotten him that far this fast.

817
02:56:38,092 --> 02:56:39,810
Have you really learned so little?

818
02:56:40,572 --> 02:56:41,971
One month flat.

819
02:56:42,132 --> 02:56:45,249
That's a new record.
Mom's still got it.

820
02:56:47,212 --> 02:56:50,443
Jack, I'm still coming to the game,
but I might be late.

821
02:56:51,732 --> 02:56:54,963
I'm sure the van can wait
for five minutes.

822
02:56:56,292 --> 02:56:59,728
I'll probably make it on time
anyway. I've gotta go. Bye.

823
02:57:02,332 --> 02:57:04,892
Sorry I'm running late,
Miss Brekenhal,

824
02:57:05,052 --> 02:57:08,522
but I've been losing consciousness
more frequently lately.

825
02:57:08,692 --> 02:57:11,252
Allergy season, I think.

826
02:57:11,412 --> 02:57:14,882
That's no problem at all.
Please call me Alison.

827
02:57:15,052 --> 02:57:18,931
Oh, well, Alison. I just have
a few questions to ask you.

828
02:57:29,692 --> 02:57:31,444
Do you smoke, Alison?

829
02:57:31,612 --> 02:57:33,045
No.

830
02:57:33,212 --> 02:57:35,362
No. Well...

831
02:57:40,492 --> 02:57:42,403
We've gotta go!

832
02:57:42,572 --> 02:57:44,449
She said she'd be a little late.

833
02:57:44,612 --> 02:57:48,890
Twenty minutes is not a little.
We've entered ''stood up'' territory.

834
02:57:49,332 --> 02:57:53,211
I worked for the English ambassador
to Turkey until they shot him.

835
02:57:53,372 --> 02:57:54,805
They shot him.

836
02:57:54,972 --> 02:57:58,203
But I kept cleaning
till they burned the Embassy down.

837
02:57:58,372 --> 02:58:00,328
Well, that was very loyal.

838
02:58:00,492 --> 02:58:02,483
So when should I start?

839
02:58:02,652 --> 02:58:06,247
If you just fill out
this application form,

840
02:58:06,412 --> 02:58:09,131
and I can verify your employment.

841
02:58:09,292 --> 02:58:10,930
Oh, certainly.

842
02:58:13,772 --> 02:58:15,490
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

843
02:58:15,652 --> 02:58:17,370
I'll get towel.

844
02:58:21,132 --> 02:58:22,485
Here.

845
02:58:34,812 --> 02:58:38,327
You seem very dedicated
to your work, Alison.

846
02:58:38,492 --> 02:58:40,050
Something inside me.

847
02:58:40,212 --> 02:58:42,965
This need to please my employer
in any way possible.

848
02:58:49,452 --> 02:58:53,525
Here is towel, and I find
other employment form.

849
02:58:55,252 --> 02:58:57,846
I don't think that'll be necessary.

850
02:58:58,012 --> 02:59:00,003
Alison seems...

851
02:59:00,852 --> 02:59:02,888
more than qualified.

852
02:59:05,452 --> 02:59:07,522
It's still wet.

853
02:59:09,372 --> 02:59:11,090
Not bad, huh?

854
02:59:12,172 --> 02:59:13,844
What?

855
02:59:14,012 --> 02:59:17,607
It's just a little hacky
to go right for the member massage.

856
02:59:17,772 --> 02:59:20,081
What are you doing
the rest of today?

857
02:59:20,252 --> 02:59:21,890
I don't know.

858
02:59:22,052 --> 02:59:23,929
Beach, nap, nothing. See ya.

859
02:59:41,212 --> 02:59:42,725
Shit!

860
02:59:43,572 --> 02:59:46,086
Shit, shit, shit!

861
02:59:48,172 --> 02:59:50,766
You really are a delicate flower.

862
02:59:51,612 --> 02:59:55,321
Jack! You missed the game.
Why didn't you go?

863
02:59:56,332 --> 02:59:57,765
I don't know.

864
02:59:57,932 --> 03:00:00,002
My friends have this theory that...

865
03:00:02,332 --> 03:00:04,163
I'm in love with you.

866
03:00:34,252 --> 03:00:35,571
Hello, daughter.

867
03:00:36,732 --> 03:00:40,202
What are you doing here?
I thought you'd be out with Tensy.

868
03:00:40,372 --> 03:00:42,966
Sometimes people
aren't where they say.

869
03:00:43,132 --> 03:00:46,329
I got bored here,
so I took myself out for a walk.

870
03:00:46,492 --> 03:00:47,811
Bullshit.

871
03:00:47,972 --> 03:00:51,408
I saw you with your boyfriend.

872
03:00:51,572 --> 03:00:53,483
You spied on me?

873
03:00:53,652 --> 03:00:56,086
So this is why
you've been so nice to me.

874
03:00:56,252 --> 03:01:01,246
- I have not been nice to you!
- You betray me for some bartender.

875
03:01:01,412 --> 03:01:05,883
That bartender owns the bar and has
an offer to sell for three million.

876
03:01:06,052 --> 03:01:07,849
You're not ready, Page.

877
03:01:08,012 --> 03:01:10,526
Yeah. I already got him
to say he loves me.

878
03:01:10,692 --> 03:01:14,241
You're not ready to con a guy
without falling in love yourself.

879
03:01:14,412 --> 03:01:16,050
I am in complete control.

880
03:01:16,212 --> 03:01:18,567
I saw the kiss.
Your eyes were closed.

881
03:01:19,572 --> 03:01:21,130
That was the sun.

882
03:01:21,292 --> 03:01:24,364
Last time the sun got in my eyes,
I got a daughter.

883
03:01:24,532 --> 03:01:27,365
And that's the worst thing
that every happened to you.

884
03:01:29,452 --> 03:01:32,330
I'm a pro, Mother, and I'll prove it.

885
03:01:52,012 --> 03:01:54,082
There. Nothing.

886
03:01:55,612 --> 03:01:58,604
But the best from you.

887
03:01:58,772 --> 03:02:00,842
Give me a chance to make it
even better.

888
03:02:19,252 --> 03:02:21,720
- Crap!
- What's wrong?

889
03:02:21,892 --> 03:02:23,883
- I gotta go.
- Why?

890
03:02:24,052 --> 03:02:27,203
- Because I'm no good for you.
- I'll be the judge of that.

891
03:02:27,372 --> 03:02:29,840
You have to trust me.
I am not a good person.

892
03:02:30,012 --> 03:02:32,890
No, you are good.
You may not know it, but I do.

893
03:02:33,052 --> 03:02:35,282
You come on tough,
but it's just an act.

894
03:02:35,452 --> 03:02:39,445
You don't even believe in sleeping
together. You're like an Osmond.

895
03:02:39,612 --> 03:02:43,400
Look, you don't get it. I haven't
been completely honest with you.

896
03:02:43,572 --> 03:02:46,689
Look, I know you're not really
an environmentalist, OK?

897
03:02:46,852 --> 03:02:51,448
Who cares? The important thing is
I love you and I want to be with you.

898
03:02:54,292 --> 03:02:55,884
I gotta go.

899
03:03:03,332 --> 03:03:05,243
You win. I dropped the con.

900
03:03:05,412 --> 03:03:07,209
It's for the best, dear.

901
03:03:07,372 --> 03:03:08,885
Shut up, Mother.

902
03:03:27,372 --> 03:03:29,044
Barbara.

903
03:03:34,892 --> 03:03:37,167
You are a lifesaver.

904
03:03:37,332 --> 03:03:39,766
To pull that job off
on such short notice.

905
03:03:39,932 --> 03:03:41,809
I was taught by the best.

906
03:03:41,972 --> 03:03:46,011
I had a blast. I've been out of the
game for so long, I forgot it's fun,

907
03:03:46,172 --> 03:03:48,481
even though we were conning
your daughter,

908
03:03:48,652 --> 03:03:51,007
who I haven't seen
since she was four.

909
03:03:51,172 --> 03:03:52,491
Three.

910
03:03:52,652 --> 03:03:55,530
But we weren't conning her.
We were protecting her.

911
03:03:55,692 --> 03:03:59,571
She wanted to run off on her own.
This was the only way to stop her.

912
03:03:59,732 --> 03:04:01,848
You won't be able
to stop her forever.

913
03:04:02,772 --> 03:04:07,448
I know that. Page is an amazing,
brilliant, talented girl.

914
03:04:07,612 --> 03:04:09,330
But she's still green.

915
03:04:09,492 --> 03:04:11,528
When she's ready, I'll tell her.

916
03:04:11,692 --> 03:04:13,330
You're sure she's not ready now?

917
03:04:15,532 --> 03:04:19,525
I just caught her kissing
some loser with her eyes closed.

918
03:04:21,052 --> 03:04:22,531
Really?

919
03:04:26,492 --> 03:04:28,050
I'll get this.

920
03:04:30,332 --> 03:04:33,085
Classy. I'm still learning from you.

921
03:04:38,492 --> 03:04:40,448
Sweetie, I'm home.

922
03:04:40,612 --> 03:04:42,284
Sounds like a good day.

923
03:04:42,452 --> 03:04:44,329
Yeah, it was fantastic.

924
03:04:44,492 --> 03:04:47,689
Is Tensy the largest producer
of phlegm on the East Coast?

925
03:04:47,852 --> 03:04:49,570
I just quit smoking.

926
03:04:49,732 --> 03:04:52,087
Well, the good news keeps on coming.

927
03:04:52,252 --> 03:04:54,527
Hey, I got a killer dress
for tonight.

928
03:04:54,692 --> 03:04:57,729
That plus the official letter
cannot fail. You want to see?

929
03:04:57,892 --> 03:05:00,167
No. I'm going out for a walk.

930
03:05:03,572 --> 03:05:06,484
OK. Well...I'm already late.

931
03:05:11,572 --> 03:05:13,608
Jane, Jane, don't hang up!

932
03:05:20,932 --> 03:05:23,400
You gotta give up on that girl, man.

933
03:05:23,572 --> 03:05:26,484
Yeah. There's something weird
about her.

934
03:05:28,092 --> 03:05:30,003
Yeah, but that's what I liked.

935
03:05:30,172 --> 03:05:31,730
Me too.

936
03:05:43,372 --> 03:05:46,808
What are you doing here?
I was coming to you.

937
03:05:46,972 --> 03:05:49,440
Let me in. I have a surprise.

938
03:05:49,612 --> 03:05:51,682
Moment. Am naked.

939
03:05:51,852 --> 03:05:53,968
I don't see a problem there.

940
03:05:55,172 --> 03:05:56,685
Here I come.

941
03:06:11,172 --> 03:06:14,050
- Oh, my!
- Completely restored.

942
03:06:14,212 --> 03:06:16,567
Only 7,000 for a new willie.

943
03:06:16,732 --> 03:06:20,202
Oh, is so nice.

944
03:06:20,492 --> 03:06:24,770
But, William, you know
how the Lord feels

945
03:06:24,932 --> 03:06:27,321
about having men in hotel room.

946
03:06:27,492 --> 03:06:31,644
Even a man who has ordered champagne
and oysters from room service?

947
03:06:36,772 --> 03:06:38,888
It's OK. I didn't charge it
to your room.

948
03:06:39,932 --> 03:06:42,082
I cannot anymore see you.

949
03:06:43,532 --> 03:06:45,124
Why on earth not?

950
03:06:45,292 --> 03:06:48,284
Let us leave at that.
Make pain less.

951
03:06:48,452 --> 03:06:51,171
Goodbye...forever.

952
03:06:55,172 --> 03:06:57,402
No, no. What is this all about?

953
03:07:01,932 --> 03:07:05,845
''We regret to inform you that your
application for permanent residence

954
03:07:06,012 --> 03:07:07,843
''has been denied.

955
03:07:08,012 --> 03:07:11,561
''You must leave the country
no later than tomorrow.''

956
03:07:11,732 --> 03:07:13,609
Oh, I try everything!

957
03:07:13,772 --> 03:07:17,447
But is very political red tape
to get green card

958
03:07:17,612 --> 03:07:19,364
and I am loopholeless.

959
03:07:21,012 --> 03:07:23,480
Well, this is horrible.

960
03:07:24,892 --> 03:07:26,723
And I was going to ask you
to marry me.

961
03:07:26,892 --> 03:07:28,405
Marry you?

962
03:07:28,572 --> 03:07:29,891
Yes.

963
03:07:30,052 --> 03:07:31,485
Yes, I...

964
03:07:31,652 --> 03:07:33,643
purchased a ring and...

965
03:07:34,332 --> 03:07:35,651
everything.

966
03:07:35,812 --> 03:07:37,450
But with your leaving...

967
03:07:38,972 --> 03:07:42,931
I am but ignorant unintelligible
foreigner,

968
03:07:43,092 --> 03:07:48,530
but if you marry me, I believe
that puts kibosh on deportation.

969
03:07:48,692 --> 03:07:50,011
Really?

970
03:07:51,212 --> 03:07:53,362
Oh, Ulga, Ulga.

971
03:07:54,532 --> 03:07:55,885
Will you...

972
03:08:00,292 --> 03:08:01,611
What?

973
03:08:01,772 --> 03:08:03,444
Marry me?

974
03:08:04,172 --> 03:08:06,845
Oh, marry you.

975
03:08:07,012 --> 03:08:09,526
Oh, is legal question.

976
03:08:09,692 --> 03:08:12,047
Yes, I will.

977
03:08:12,212 --> 03:08:13,964
Is binding answer.

978
03:08:20,772 --> 03:08:22,490
Leave me alone.

979
03:08:22,652 --> 03:08:26,645
I'm engaged! We're talking
a settlement of 20 million minimum.

980
03:08:26,812 --> 03:08:28,768
We're finally set for life, darling.

981
03:08:28,932 --> 03:08:30,968
I just have time for one quick whoo!

982
03:08:41,332 --> 03:08:42,651
I said whoo.

983
03:08:42,812 --> 03:08:44,370
Why won't you talk to me?

984
03:08:45,572 --> 03:08:47,403
There's nothing to say.

985
03:08:47,572 --> 03:08:50,484
I scared you when I told you
I loved you, didn't I?

986
03:08:50,652 --> 03:08:52,608
Jack, there is no love.

987
03:08:52,772 --> 03:08:54,569
It's just a trick of the brain -

988
03:08:54,732 --> 03:08:57,371
a combination of hormones
and chemicals.

989
03:08:57,532 --> 03:08:59,329
Then why are you here?

990
03:09:02,252 --> 03:09:04,527
Tell me to my face
you don't love me.

991
03:09:04,692 --> 03:09:06,205
I don't love you.

992
03:09:06,372 --> 03:09:10,206
Wow. More believable
than I thought it would be.

993
03:09:18,052 --> 03:09:21,010
I know I freaked you out
by moving too fast

994
03:09:21,172 --> 03:09:23,208
with all that ''I love you'' stuff.

995
03:09:23,372 --> 03:09:26,284
So let's just...get married.

996
03:09:28,372 --> 03:09:29,964
I gotta go.

997
03:09:43,252 --> 03:09:45,004
That is jarring.

998
03:09:45,412 --> 03:09:49,564
My love, tonight we will celebrate
this ecstatic joining of our spirits

999
03:09:49,732 --> 03:09:51,484
with the union...

1000
03:09:53,652 --> 03:09:55,449
of our aching bodies.

1001
03:09:57,732 --> 03:09:59,848
Oh, you have stomach cramp again.

1002
03:10:00,012 --> 03:10:02,446
No. I ache for you, my pumpkin.
Let's hump.

1003
03:10:02,612 --> 03:10:04,125
William, my religion.

1004
03:10:04,292 --> 03:10:06,123
Humping is not yet allowed.

1005
03:10:06,292 --> 03:10:08,522
Of course it is.
I proposed, you accepted.

1006
03:10:08,692 --> 03:10:10,967
To God, everything else
is just paperwork.

1007
03:10:11,132 --> 03:10:14,283
William, I insist we wait
till after wedding.

1008
03:10:14,452 --> 03:10:16,886
Ulga, I am much more powerful
than you.

1009
03:10:17,052 --> 03:10:19,008
Now just relax and enjoy it.

1010
03:10:30,132 --> 03:10:31,565
William?

1011
03:10:31,732 --> 03:10:33,688
William? Oh.

1012
03:10:33,852 --> 03:10:36,320
Always something in your mouth.

1013
03:10:38,172 --> 03:10:39,525
William?

1014
03:10:39,692 --> 03:10:41,125
Are you dead?

1015
03:10:53,332 --> 03:10:54,845
No.

1016
03:10:55,012 --> 03:10:57,207
No! Why me?

1017
03:10:57,372 --> 03:11:00,523
Oh, wake up, you disgusting shit!

1018
03:11:01,852 --> 03:11:03,649
Twenty million.

1019
03:11:06,812 --> 03:11:09,007
- What?
- I need you here.

1020
03:11:14,412 --> 03:11:16,880
Well, that's real attractive.

1021
03:11:17,292 --> 03:11:20,329
We've got to make it look like
he died at his house alone.

1022
03:11:20,492 --> 03:11:22,369
Room service!

1023
03:11:25,252 --> 03:11:26,844
Let's get him to the bedroom.

1024
03:11:29,092 --> 03:11:31,287
OK. Too far.

1025
03:11:32,932 --> 03:11:34,251
The balcony.

1026
03:11:40,132 --> 03:11:42,088
Just hold him. I'll be right back.

1027
03:11:51,052 --> 03:11:52,565
Champagne and oysters.

1028
03:11:53,452 --> 03:11:55,329
- All this just for you?
- Oh, yes.

1029
03:11:55,492 --> 03:11:57,642
I mean, someone is joining me.

1030
03:11:57,812 --> 03:12:00,690
- I'll open the champagne.
- I'll take care of it.

1031
03:12:00,852 --> 03:12:03,764
Thank you. Tip's included.
Good night.

1032
03:12:15,572 --> 03:12:17,608
I ask you to do one simple thing...

1033
03:12:17,772 --> 03:12:20,764
I don't consider holding
a 500-pound corpse simple.

1034
03:12:20,932 --> 03:12:23,844
- You flung open the door...
- I didn't fling it!

1035
03:12:24,012 --> 03:12:26,970
We just have to get the body
back to the house.

1036
03:12:28,652 --> 03:12:30,165
Have you seen her?

1037
03:12:30,332 --> 03:12:31,651
Dean.

1038
03:12:31,812 --> 03:12:33,211
Shit!

1039
03:12:33,372 --> 03:12:35,886
- Angela!
- I'll meet you in five minutes.

1040
03:12:36,052 --> 03:12:37,849
- He looks pissed.
- I'll handle him.

1041
03:12:38,012 --> 03:12:39,331
Angela!

1042
03:12:44,132 --> 03:12:45,451
Angela!

1043
03:12:47,852 --> 03:12:49,285
Angela!

1044
03:12:50,572 --> 03:12:52,369
- Angela!
- Oh, God!

1045
03:12:52,532 --> 03:12:54,204
Angela, stop!

1046
03:12:59,412 --> 03:13:01,448
I have missed you so much. So much.

1047
03:13:01,612 --> 03:13:05,048
I've never been so in love
with anybody in my entire life.

1048
03:13:05,212 --> 03:13:06,850
I'm begging you!

1049
03:13:07,012 --> 03:13:10,288
Just give me one more chance.
Marry me again.

1050
03:13:10,972 --> 03:13:12,963
What? Get up.

1051
03:13:13,132 --> 03:13:15,168
How did you find me?

1052
03:13:15,332 --> 03:13:17,971
The title for the Mercedes
gave this as your address.

1053
03:13:18,132 --> 03:13:19,690
I drove straight through.

1054
03:13:19,852 --> 03:13:23,083
Your hair's different.
It looks really pretty. I like it.

1055
03:13:23,252 --> 03:13:24,605
- Give me a kiss.
- No.

1056
03:13:24,772 --> 03:13:26,330
No, no, I've changed.

1057
03:13:26,492 --> 03:13:29,768
I've totally changed. This place
is crawling with prime trim,

1058
03:13:29,932 --> 03:13:31,524
I'm barely even noticing.

1059
03:13:31,692 --> 03:13:34,490
- I can't deal with this now.
- No, listen to me!

1060
03:13:34,652 --> 03:13:36,882
I'm not leaving without you.
I love you.

1061
03:13:37,052 --> 03:13:40,362
I don't care who hears it.
I love her! I love her! I love her!

1062
03:13:40,532 --> 03:13:43,569
I love her! What do you want me
to do? You want me to sing?

1063
03:13:43,732 --> 03:13:45,211
Come fly with me

1064
03:13:45,372 --> 03:13:48,205
- Come fly, come fly...
- Shut up!

1065
03:13:49,332 --> 03:13:51,482
What do you want, baby?
I'll do anything.

1066
03:13:52,892 --> 03:13:54,211
Anything?

1067
03:13:54,372 --> 03:13:59,082
I had no idea
you were into this stuff. Ow!

1068
03:13:59,852 --> 03:14:02,844
I've been trying
a lot of new things lately.

1069
03:14:04,092 --> 03:14:06,048
Oh, wait. I don't know about that.

1070
03:14:07,652 --> 03:14:09,210
Are you questioning me?

1071
03:14:09,372 --> 03:14:11,602
No. No, no, no. It's just...

1072
03:14:12,852 --> 03:14:15,002
Kiss my foot and apologise.

1073
03:14:18,092 --> 03:14:20,367
I'm sorry. Ah...

1074
03:14:20,532 --> 03:14:21,851
Good boy.

1075
03:14:23,892 --> 03:14:26,247
Oooh, yes.

1076
03:14:28,332 --> 03:14:31,449
Now, I'm just gonna get some...

1077
03:14:32,052 --> 03:14:34,008
whipped cream.

1078
03:14:36,932 --> 03:14:39,127
I got no problem with that.

1079
03:14:40,492 --> 03:14:42,926
I'll be right back.

1080
03:14:45,932 --> 03:14:47,365
Hurry up.

1081
03:14:56,932 --> 03:14:59,924
Careful. We don't want
any more damage to the body.

1082
03:15:04,092 --> 03:15:07,482
- Housekeeping!
- No. No. No!

1083
03:15:07,652 --> 03:15:09,051
Housekeeping.

1084
03:15:09,212 --> 03:15:11,123
No! No! No! No!

1085
03:15:13,452 --> 03:15:15,886
I don't need anything.
Please just get lost.

1086
03:15:18,412 --> 03:15:20,004
Lady!

1087
03:15:20,172 --> 03:15:23,244
You know, I've been cleaning
this room for three weeks,

1088
03:15:23,412 --> 03:15:24,811
and so far, no tip.

1089
03:15:24,972 --> 03:15:27,691
- There's 20 bucks in my pants.
- 20?

1090
03:15:27,852 --> 03:15:31,049
How about I sit on your kinky face
for a while?

1091
03:15:32,132 --> 03:15:34,009
OK, OK, OK! 50.

1092
03:15:34,172 --> 03:15:35,764
That's more like it.

1093
03:15:36,532 --> 03:15:38,204
Unbelievable.

1094
03:15:42,012 --> 03:15:44,082
Both of these wallets yours?

1095
03:15:45,452 --> 03:15:48,285
Two wallets? Untie me.

1096
03:15:48,452 --> 03:15:50,522
Now, that'll be another 20.

1097
03:15:52,652 --> 03:15:55,166
All right. He's sleeping.

1098
03:15:55,332 --> 03:15:58,130
He wakes up having one
of his famous coughing fits,

1099
03:15:58,292 --> 03:16:02,729
flails around, and falls onto
the statue becoming peniley impaled.

1100
03:16:02,892 --> 03:16:04,848
That's believable, right?

1101
03:16:05,012 --> 03:16:06,843
I just really need a shower.

1102
03:16:08,012 --> 03:16:09,730
Where's the penis?

1103
03:16:09,892 --> 03:16:12,850
It's still there. It's just
the rigor mortis is gone.

1104
03:16:13,012 --> 03:16:15,048
Not his, the statue's.

1105
03:16:15,212 --> 03:16:18,170
It's still in the car. I'll get it.
There you go.

1106
03:16:52,692 --> 03:16:54,011
This is...

1107
03:16:54,172 --> 03:16:56,049
This is unbelievable.

1108
03:16:58,172 --> 03:16:59,491
Oh, God!

1109
03:17:00,852 --> 03:17:02,604
0h, God!

1110
03:17:02,772 --> 03:17:04,728
You are so enormous.

1111
03:17:07,012 --> 03:17:08,809
0h, God, please...

1112
03:17:12,012 --> 03:17:13,730
You gold-digging whore!

1113
03:17:13,892 --> 03:17:18,408
You're already working someone else?
Get off of her, asshole! Get off!

1114
03:17:18,572 --> 03:17:20,483
- Don't shoot him, Dean.
- Why not?

1115
03:17:20,652 --> 03:17:21,971
He's already dead.

1116
03:17:23,332 --> 03:17:25,641
Oh, you are one sick slut!

1117
03:17:25,812 --> 03:17:28,565
I am not a sick slut.

1118
03:17:28,732 --> 03:17:30,484
One penis coming up, Mom!

1119
03:17:31,412 --> 03:17:34,085
- Wendy?
- Er, hello.

1120
03:17:36,572 --> 03:17:37,971
Mom?

1121
03:17:39,492 --> 03:17:42,245
- You're her mother?
- It's just a nickname.

1122
03:17:42,412 --> 03:17:44,050
Oh, my God.

1123
03:17:45,372 --> 03:17:46,930
Oh, my God.

1124
03:17:47,932 --> 03:17:49,843
- You two played me.
- Oh, no.

1125
03:17:51,412 --> 03:17:53,368
The whole marriage was bullshit.

1126
03:17:53,532 --> 03:17:55,329
And this one you even offed!

1127
03:17:55,492 --> 03:18:00,088
We didn't off him.
He coughed himself to death.

1128
03:18:00,252 --> 03:18:03,403
Yeah, right! You let
your own daughter seduce me?!

1129
03:18:03,572 --> 03:18:06,040
Do you know how much therapy
you people need?

1130
03:18:06,212 --> 03:18:07,964
Look, Dean...

1131
03:18:08,132 --> 03:18:10,282
I don't blame you for being upset.

1132
03:18:10,452 --> 03:18:12,408
We did an awful thing.

1133
03:18:12,572 --> 03:18:16,770
And for the first time,
I feel really bad about it.

1134
03:18:16,932 --> 03:18:20,083
But maybe,
despite all this craziness,

1135
03:18:20,252 --> 03:18:22,482
there's still hope for us after all.

1136
03:18:22,652 --> 03:18:25,120
There's more hope for you and him
than for us!

1137
03:18:25,292 --> 03:18:28,807
Dean, please tell me it's OK.
I love you.

1138
03:18:28,972 --> 03:18:30,485
Forget it.

1139
03:18:30,652 --> 03:18:33,041
Fine! Look, you brought this
on yourself.

1140
03:18:33,212 --> 03:18:36,090
- You cheated on me.
- You set me up to cheat!

1141
03:18:36,252 --> 03:18:38,846
We can't make a scumbag do anything
he wouldn't do...

1142
03:18:39,012 --> 03:18:41,321
Shut up, junior slut!
Get over there!

1143
03:18:42,412 --> 03:18:46,166
You two got some brass balls
in those panties. I'll give you that.

1144
03:18:47,572 --> 03:18:49,608
In the few moments you have left...

1145
03:18:50,772 --> 03:18:54,287
I want to see some begging
and some pleading.

1146
03:18:55,772 --> 03:18:57,091
Mom...

1147
03:18:57,252 --> 03:19:00,164
Dean, you got so many tells.

1148
03:19:00,972 --> 03:19:03,884
You are not the killing type.

1149
03:19:04,052 --> 03:19:07,328
Don't screw with me.
I'm on a fine edge here. Don't.

1150
03:19:10,092 --> 03:19:12,242
See? No bullets.

1151
03:19:12,412 --> 03:19:14,972
Fine. So I'm not that big
on homicide!

1152
03:19:15,132 --> 03:19:17,771
But I could do worse!
I found all your IDs!

1153
03:19:17,932 --> 03:19:20,082
All your aliases.

1154
03:19:20,252 --> 03:19:23,927
I'll get them to the cops when they
start investigating decomposing boy!

1155
03:19:24,092 --> 03:19:26,560
You two will get
some filthy lesbo lockdown!

1156
03:19:26,732 --> 03:19:28,085
With bad lighting!

1157
03:19:29,492 --> 03:19:32,325
I don't have to kill you
to kill you.

1158
03:19:33,172 --> 03:19:36,960
Dean, wait! Look, what if
we gave you back your money?

1159
03:19:39,412 --> 03:19:40,731
Well?

1160
03:19:41,612 --> 03:19:43,364
I stopped walking, didn't I?

1161
03:19:43,532 --> 03:19:45,090
First you've got to help us

1162
03:19:45,252 --> 03:19:49,848
make it look like this creep died
here, so there's no questions.

1163
03:19:50,012 --> 03:19:52,810
- You know how to do that?
- I'm from Jersey, aren't I?

1164
03:19:54,852 --> 03:19:58,128
Boy, Dean was really incredible
with that body.

1165
03:19:58,292 --> 03:20:00,760
Well, you gonna let me in
on the play?

1166
03:20:00,932 --> 03:20:02,650
What play?

1167
03:20:02,812 --> 03:20:04,848
You promised that mook 300,000.

1168
03:20:05,012 --> 03:20:09,051
When we take him to the bank,
we'll be about 300,000 short.

1169
03:20:09,212 --> 03:20:12,045
- The money will be there.
- What?

1170
03:20:12,212 --> 03:20:14,282
I don't want a big scene about this,

1171
03:20:14,452 --> 03:20:16,761
but Mrs Vogal from the IRS
was more of a

1172
03:20:16,932 --> 03:20:20,288
''protecting you from making the
worst mistake of your life'' thing

1173
03:20:20,452 --> 03:20:23,125
than a ''the government
took all our money'' thing. OK?

1174
03:20:23,492 --> 03:20:24,811
What?

1175
03:20:24,972 --> 03:20:28,487
I pulled a tiny little con
to keep you from leaving.

1176
03:20:28,652 --> 03:20:31,086
Oh, you bitch of bitches!

1177
03:20:35,652 --> 03:20:37,404
Stop it!

1178
03:20:39,852 --> 03:20:43,606
There seems to be a problem
with your account, Ms Conners.

1179
03:20:43,772 --> 03:20:47,401
- It was closed yesterday.
- That's impossible.

1180
03:20:47,572 --> 03:20:49,767
- What the hell is going on?
- Nothing. I swear.

1181
03:20:49,932 --> 03:20:51,570
Here's the signature.

1182
03:20:54,692 --> 03:20:56,091
Barbara.

1183
03:20:57,412 --> 03:20:58,731
Wait.

1184
03:20:58,892 --> 03:21:03,090
I gave my old partner all my account
numbers for the IRS scam

1185
03:21:03,252 --> 03:21:05,686
and that hag ripped off every penny!

1186
03:21:05,852 --> 03:21:07,490
Tell that to your cellmates.

1187
03:21:07,652 --> 03:21:09,563
For once she's telling the truth.

1188
03:21:09,732 --> 03:21:13,486
I'm going to believe the seed of Satan?
Give me the keys to my car.

1189
03:21:13,652 --> 03:21:15,802
- What?
- Give me the keys to the Mercedes.

1190
03:21:15,972 --> 03:21:17,291
Goodbye.

1191
03:21:19,252 --> 03:21:24,087
I can't believe it. I can't believe
this. I've blown both our lives.

1192
03:21:24,252 --> 03:21:27,722
I'm sorry, Page.
I'm a terrible person.

1193
03:21:28,212 --> 03:21:30,043
I'm a terrible mother.

1194
03:21:31,972 --> 03:21:34,247
I'm a terrible everything.

1195
03:21:40,812 --> 03:21:44,521
Aw... You're finally
seeing things clearly.

1196
03:21:54,732 --> 03:21:56,723
What the hell are you doing?

1197
03:21:58,332 --> 03:22:02,644
You want money? The guy who wants to
marry me is worth 1.5 in a divorce.

1198
03:22:26,132 --> 03:22:29,044
- She's just gonna screw with him.
- Hugely.

1199
03:22:30,012 --> 03:22:32,890
I was wondering how long
you were gonna stay this time.

1200
03:22:33,052 --> 03:22:34,326
Look...

1201
03:22:34,492 --> 03:22:38,371
I know I've been horrible,
but this talk about love and marriage

1202
03:22:38,532 --> 03:22:40,921
can make anyone act freaky.

1203
03:22:41,612 --> 03:22:45,605
I know that I must seem
like a mean selfish bitch, but...

1204
03:22:45,772 --> 03:22:50,243
No. You seem like the sweetest,
most wonderful person I've ever met.

1205
03:22:51,372 --> 03:22:52,725
What a moron.

1206
03:22:54,012 --> 03:22:58,767
Friends, employees,
beer wholesaler...

1207
03:22:58,932 --> 03:23:00,809
I have an announcement.

1208
03:23:02,012 --> 03:23:04,082
Jane and I are getting married.

1209
03:23:06,572 --> 03:23:09,166
- That is awesome!
- Yeah.

1210
03:23:10,532 --> 03:23:12,204
Jane, come here.

1211
03:23:12,372 --> 03:23:17,162
Jack, so now that you have
some extra responsibilities,

1212
03:23:17,332 --> 03:23:20,130
that doesn't mean
you're going to sell this place?

1213
03:23:20,292 --> 03:23:21,964
No. We'll do just fine.

1214
03:23:24,692 --> 03:23:26,250
Thanks, man.

1215
03:23:27,652 --> 03:23:29,404
Sell what, honey?

1216
03:23:29,572 --> 03:23:32,848
Nothing. Someone offered me three
million for the bar and the land.

1217
03:23:33,012 --> 03:23:35,685
Three million.
That sounds like something.

1218
03:23:35,852 --> 03:23:39,686
Yeah, but this place was my dad's.
You know, it's home.

1219
03:23:39,852 --> 03:23:42,241
It's too late anyway.
They got another lot.

1220
03:23:42,412 --> 03:23:43,731
Yeah.

1221
03:23:47,972 --> 03:23:49,610
There's no money. I'm bailing.

1222
03:23:49,772 --> 03:23:52,411
No! You can still get
a decent settlement.

1223
03:23:52,572 --> 03:23:54,961
He'll lose the bar.
This is wrong. It's over.

1224
03:23:55,132 --> 03:23:57,407
She's growing a conscience
on my score?

1225
03:23:57,572 --> 03:24:00,325
Don't make her do this.
I'll get your money.

1226
03:24:00,492 --> 03:24:02,005
No. We're doing it.

1227
03:24:02,972 --> 03:24:04,849
May I have this dance?

1228
03:24:05,012 --> 03:24:06,923
Um, Jack...

1229
03:24:10,492 --> 03:24:11,925
I gotta go.

1230
03:24:17,612 --> 03:24:20,046
Is that who I think it is? Jane!

1231
03:24:20,212 --> 03:24:22,009
Is it. How are you, darling?

1232
03:24:22,172 --> 03:24:23,651
Pissed off.

1233
03:24:23,812 --> 03:24:26,963
We were just on our way
to see you at the hotel.

1234
03:24:28,652 --> 03:24:30,563
Oh, this isn't Jack, is it?

1235
03:24:30,732 --> 03:24:32,802
Jane goes on and on about you.

1236
03:24:32,972 --> 03:24:34,485
I think she's in love!

1237
03:24:34,652 --> 03:24:39,168
I'm Betty, Jane's second cousin,
and this is my brother.

1238
03:24:39,332 --> 03:24:41,050
Vinny Staggliano.

1239
03:24:41,772 --> 03:24:43,967
I'm afraid you caught us
at a weird time.

1240
03:24:44,132 --> 03:24:46,043
I just asked asked Jane
to marry me and...

1241
03:24:46,212 --> 03:24:48,646
Oh, that's great! Congratulations.

1242
03:24:48,812 --> 03:24:50,962
I think she's having
second thoughts.

1243
03:24:51,132 --> 03:24:53,088
That's just the way our Jane is.

1244
03:24:53,252 --> 03:24:56,767
But she gets over it though.
Especially when her family's here.

1245
03:24:56,932 --> 03:24:58,843
Why don't you kiss and make up?

1246
03:24:59,012 --> 03:25:02,687
- I'm not really in the mood...
- Kiss. That's nice.

1247
03:25:05,372 --> 03:25:07,647
I think your relatives
are gonna like Bill's boat.

1248
03:25:07,812 --> 03:25:09,643
Who cares what they like?

1249
03:25:09,812 --> 03:25:11,291
Nice boat.

1250
03:25:18,492 --> 03:25:21,165
I'm so sorry. I'm so clumsy.

1251
03:25:22,692 --> 03:25:24,011
That's OK.

1252
03:25:25,772 --> 03:25:27,808
- How ya doing, Skippy?
- Hey.

1253
03:25:27,972 --> 03:25:29,325
Hey, you.

1254
03:25:29,492 --> 03:25:32,529
I got the lotion.
Who's got the hands?

1255
03:25:33,332 --> 03:25:35,766
Don't look at me.
I don't like getting all gunky.

1256
03:25:36,852 --> 03:25:38,365
Jack, would you mind?

1257
03:25:38,532 --> 03:25:40,443
- Sure.
- Thanks, babe.

1258
03:25:42,572 --> 03:25:46,611
You are the most kind,
wonderful man.

1259
03:25:48,812 --> 03:25:50,689
Look at all the fish.

1260
03:25:56,572 --> 03:25:59,006
Got it. This is gonna be a fun trip.

1261
03:26:04,612 --> 03:26:08,321
I honestly don't know why you'd
want to wear an off-the-shoulder.

1262
03:26:08,492 --> 03:26:10,130
This is what I want.

1263
03:26:10,292 --> 03:26:12,089
Fine. What would I know?

1264
03:26:12,252 --> 03:26:14,686
I've only been married 13 times.

1265
03:26:15,732 --> 03:26:17,643
I'm coming out. You'd better be nice.

1266
03:26:17,812 --> 03:26:19,370
I'm always nice.

1267
03:26:27,932 --> 03:26:29,285
What's wrong?

1268
03:26:31,532 --> 03:26:33,170
Nothing.

1269
03:26:33,332 --> 03:26:35,368
Fine.
If you're going to be sarcastic.

1270
03:26:35,532 --> 03:26:37,762
I'm not being sarcastic.

1271
03:26:40,012 --> 03:26:41,331
It's perfect.

1272
03:26:41,492 --> 03:26:44,802
Really?
There's nothing you would change?

1273
03:26:46,052 --> 03:26:47,451
Not a thing.

1274
03:26:47,612 --> 03:26:49,170
Oh, my God.

1275
03:26:49,332 --> 03:26:52,802
I might just see
what it looks like without this.

1276
03:26:54,292 --> 03:26:55,964
I take it back.

1277
03:26:57,372 --> 03:27:00,762
No. No, I like that idea.

1278
03:27:00,932 --> 03:27:03,571
So, Mother likes it?

1279
03:27:03,852 --> 03:27:06,082
- She's not my mother.
- I'm not her mother.

1280
03:27:25,852 --> 03:27:28,844
You really are good at this.
I'm almost buying it.

1281
03:27:29,572 --> 03:27:31,961
Ladies and gentlemen,
friends and family.

1282
03:27:32,132 --> 03:27:35,920
We have come here today
to celebrate two wonderful people

1283
03:27:36,092 --> 03:27:38,560
who have managed to find each other

1284
03:27:38,732 --> 03:27:41,530
in this sometimes
seemingly cold world,

1285
03:27:41,692 --> 03:27:43,410
and pledge their hearts.

1286
03:27:44,492 --> 03:27:46,722
Do you, Jack Withrowe,

1287
03:27:46,892 --> 03:27:49,690
take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife,

1288
03:27:49,852 --> 03:27:52,207
to love her, honour her
and cherish her

1289
03:27:52,372 --> 03:27:54,249
until death do you part?

1290
03:27:54,412 --> 03:27:55,891
I do.

1291
03:27:56,052 --> 03:27:58,441
And do you, Jane Helstrom,

1292
03:27:58,612 --> 03:28:01,331
take this man to be
your lawful wedded husband,

1293
03:28:01,492 --> 03:28:05,770
to love, honour and to cherish him
until death do you part?

1294
03:28:09,852 --> 03:28:11,171
I do.

1295
03:28:11,972 --> 03:28:13,291
What?

1296
03:28:16,252 --> 03:28:17,571
I do.

1297
03:28:18,852 --> 03:28:22,561
I now pronounce you husband
and wife, and you may kiss the bride.

1298
03:28:29,452 --> 03:28:33,047
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
Mr and Mrs Withrowe.

1299
03:28:57,612 --> 03:28:59,682
Make sure he sees you drinking a lot.

1300
03:28:59,852 --> 03:29:01,968
That won't be hard.

1301
03:29:03,812 --> 03:29:06,929
There's my wonderful
new daughter-in-law.

1302
03:29:07,092 --> 03:29:09,925
- Are you avoiding me?
- Uh, no.

1303
03:29:10,612 --> 03:29:11,965
I gotta go.

1304
03:29:14,092 --> 03:29:16,845
Don't let it bother you.
She's shyer than shit.

1305
03:29:17,772 --> 03:29:20,445
What is it you do, Mr Staggliano?

1306
03:29:22,332 --> 03:29:24,004
College professor.

1307
03:29:24,172 --> 03:29:26,481
Oh, what do you teach?

1308
03:29:27,932 --> 03:29:30,605
College stuff.
What are you, a fucking cop?

1309
03:29:31,212 --> 03:29:33,282
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1310
03:29:35,652 --> 03:29:37,483
I'll only need 30 minutes.

1311
03:29:37,652 --> 03:29:39,768
It won't work. He loves me too much.

1312
03:29:39,932 --> 03:29:42,162
Men don't turn women down.

1313
03:30:00,732 --> 03:30:03,769
Just like our first date,
only less mud.

1314
03:30:04,172 --> 03:30:05,844
It's beautiful.

1315
03:30:11,932 --> 03:30:13,251
Happy?

1316
03:30:17,052 --> 03:30:19,043
I always know the right thing
to say.

1317
03:30:19,972 --> 03:30:22,566
I love you...Jack.

1318
03:30:22,892 --> 03:30:25,042
I love you very much.

1319
03:30:26,692 --> 03:30:31,049
You're different, aren't you?
You wouldn't let anything ruin this.

1320
03:30:31,212 --> 03:30:34,488
Well, sometimes these hotel soaps
irritate my skin.

1321
03:30:35,532 --> 03:30:37,090
I'm serious.

1322
03:30:38,932 --> 03:30:41,651
Say nothing will ruin us.

1323
03:30:41,812 --> 03:30:46,283
Nothing will ever take me away
or keep me from loving you.

1324
03:30:54,612 --> 03:30:57,524
Um...can I have some water?

1325
03:30:58,492 --> 03:31:00,562
I think I drank too much champagne.

1326
03:31:00,732 --> 03:31:02,051
OK.

1327
03:31:18,812 --> 03:31:20,211
Jane?

1328
03:31:56,092 --> 03:31:57,445
Jack?

1329
03:31:58,532 --> 03:32:00,887
What are you doing out here alone?

1330
03:32:01,052 --> 03:32:04,567
Oh, my wife celebrated herself
into an early coma.

1331
03:32:06,212 --> 03:32:08,931
Well, her loss is my gain.

1332
03:32:09,092 --> 03:32:11,686
Walk me to my room.
I have a wedding gift for you.

1333
03:32:11,852 --> 03:32:13,763
No, that's OK. I was just gonna...

1334
03:32:13,932 --> 03:32:17,402
Oh, come on. You can't turn down
a wedding gift. It's bad luck.

1335
03:32:18,292 --> 03:32:20,044
- I never heard that.
- Sure.

1336
03:32:20,212 --> 03:32:22,646
Everything to do with weddings
is bad luck.

1337
03:32:29,572 --> 03:32:31,483
I can only stay a minute.

1338
03:32:33,252 --> 03:32:35,129
Will you just relax?

1339
03:32:35,292 --> 03:32:36,611
OK? Sit down.

1340
03:32:40,572 --> 03:32:42,563
This hotel is so nice.

1341
03:32:42,732 --> 03:32:45,804
I'm so glad my brother and I
decided to stay here too.

1342
03:32:45,972 --> 03:32:48,691
Er, yeah, it's...

1343
03:32:50,092 --> 03:32:52,560
You mentioned something about a gift.

1344
03:32:55,612 --> 03:32:57,762
You're so greedy.

1345
03:32:57,932 --> 03:33:02,244
But I happen to have it right here.

1346
03:33:06,332 --> 03:33:09,085
Cognac. Wow.

1347
03:33:09,252 --> 03:33:11,208
80 years old.

1348
03:33:11,572 --> 03:33:13,847
Jane is gonna love this.
Thank you so much.

1349
03:33:14,012 --> 03:33:16,810
Oh, can't we just try some?

1350
03:33:16,972 --> 03:33:18,451
Please?

1351
03:33:20,092 --> 03:33:21,411
Jack.

1352
03:33:25,612 --> 03:33:28,206
Thought you might not
want to wait alone. Ow!

1353
03:33:28,372 --> 03:33:31,250
Ow, ow. Could be wrong.

1354
03:33:31,892 --> 03:33:34,326
It feels good going down, doesn't it?

1355
03:33:34,492 --> 03:33:35,845
It's er...

1356
03:33:36,012 --> 03:33:37,570
It's really good.

1357
03:33:49,772 --> 03:33:52,889
No, thanks. I should
be getting back to Jane.

1358
03:33:53,052 --> 03:33:55,168
Jack, she's asleep.

1359
03:33:55,332 --> 03:33:59,644
Come on. You deserve to have
a bit of fun on your wedding night.

1360
03:34:00,732 --> 03:34:02,211
It's just fruit.

1361
03:34:09,652 --> 03:34:11,529
It's just a waste of time.

1362
03:34:11,692 --> 03:34:15,605
He's just gonna throw her out
on her ass. I'm not worried.

1363
03:34:15,772 --> 03:34:18,127
Is that why you're melting down
the remote?

1364
03:34:20,892 --> 03:34:22,211
Cute.

1365
03:34:34,052 --> 03:34:36,247
You got a tiny bit of cream...

1366
03:34:37,732 --> 03:34:39,051
right...

1367
03:34:50,572 --> 03:34:53,530
- I gotta go.
- Oh, why?

1368
03:34:53,692 --> 03:34:55,967
- I just can't do this.
- What's the matter?

1369
03:34:56,132 --> 03:35:00,444
Is it because
you don't find me attractive?

1370
03:35:00,612 --> 03:35:04,241
No. No. A part of me
is very, very interested,

1371
03:35:04,412 --> 03:35:07,688
but the other parts are yelling,
''You just married her cousin.''

1372
03:35:07,852 --> 03:35:09,888
Jane would never know. I promise.

1373
03:35:10,052 --> 03:35:11,770
Yeah, but I would.

1374
03:35:11,932 --> 03:35:14,810
I could never do that
to someone I love.

1375
03:35:17,012 --> 03:35:18,331
Yeah.

1376
03:35:18,492 --> 03:35:20,608
You really do love her, don't you?

1377
03:35:20,772 --> 03:35:24,082
Yeah, and I really
should be getting back.

1378
03:35:24,252 --> 03:35:26,402
Look, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

1379
03:35:26,572 --> 03:35:28,563
Please don't leave like this.

1380
03:35:28,732 --> 03:35:32,407
Can't we just, you know,
have a make-up drink or something?

1381
03:35:32,572 --> 03:35:34,324
I'll be good, I promise.

1382
03:35:36,332 --> 03:35:37,651
Please.

1383
03:35:46,172 --> 03:35:48,891
- I'm going over there.
- It isn't time yet.

1384
03:35:49,052 --> 03:35:51,361
I don't care, you shit!
I can't do this to him.

1385
03:35:51,532 --> 03:35:53,762
It hurts when you screw
with people's feelings.

1386
03:35:53,932 --> 03:35:55,251
Not as much as this.

1387
03:36:06,372 --> 03:36:08,886
Oh, my God! Jane!

1388
03:36:09,652 --> 03:36:11,529
What?

1389
03:36:13,012 --> 03:36:14,570
I'm sorry.

1390
03:36:19,972 --> 03:36:24,250
While we are willing to admit some
wrongdoing on the part of my client,

1391
03:36:24,412 --> 03:36:27,324
given the extremely short duration
of the marriage...

1392
03:36:27,492 --> 03:36:30,404
No negotiation.
Give her whatever she wants.

1393
03:36:32,132 --> 03:36:34,168
We talked about you not saying that.

1394
03:36:34,332 --> 03:36:36,323
Give her whatever she wants.

1395
03:36:42,692 --> 03:36:45,081
Jane. Jane!

1396
03:36:45,252 --> 03:36:48,767
I don't know what happened.
It was weird.

1397
03:36:48,932 --> 03:36:51,002
There's only one man in the world.

1398
03:37:02,692 --> 03:37:04,887
What the hell's taking so long?

1399
03:37:05,052 --> 03:37:07,407
Oh, relax. You'll get your money.

1400
03:37:07,572 --> 03:37:10,006
You destroyed my daughter,
but you'll get it.

1401
03:37:10,172 --> 03:37:13,403
Hey, I was minding my own business
when you bitches came along

1402
03:37:13,572 --> 03:37:16,291
and ripped out my heart
for a game of hacky sack!

1403
03:37:16,452 --> 03:37:19,649
Come off it.
We're both the same. Scum.

1404
03:37:19,812 --> 03:37:21,370
We are not the same.

1405
03:37:21,532 --> 03:37:23,762
I wasn't lying when I said ''I do''.

1406
03:37:23,932 --> 03:37:26,810
No, you were lying
when you tried to nail Page.

1407
03:37:26,972 --> 03:37:30,044
Look, where I come from
guys make mistakes sometimes.

1408
03:37:30,212 --> 03:37:32,680
It didn't change the fact
that I loved you.

1409
03:37:35,012 --> 03:37:36,650
I know I wouldn't do it again.

1410
03:37:36,812 --> 03:37:38,882
- Because you got caught.
- No.

1411
03:37:39,052 --> 03:37:41,008
Because of what I lost.

1412
03:37:41,172 --> 03:37:44,448
I'm not the only guy in the world
that's ever screwed up.

1413
03:37:44,612 --> 03:37:48,048
Even a goody-goody like Jack
can't keep his wang in the hanger.

1414
03:37:48,212 --> 03:37:49,565
Yes, he can.

1415
03:37:49,732 --> 03:37:52,326
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

1416
03:37:52,492 --> 03:37:54,608
No, no, no. What did you say?

1417
03:37:55,972 --> 03:37:57,485
I micked him.

1418
03:37:58,972 --> 03:38:00,371
Strictotoxin.

1419
03:38:00,532 --> 03:38:03,842
You're between out and awake.
I makes people easy to handle.

1420
03:38:04,012 --> 03:38:06,401
Whoa! Wait. You're kidding?
He said no,

1421
03:38:06,572 --> 03:38:09,211
and you let her believe
he went for a soil sample?

1422
03:38:09,372 --> 03:38:11,283
That's a new low, even for you!

1423
03:38:11,452 --> 03:38:15,047
Look, you wanted your money.
What was I supposed to do?

1424
03:38:15,212 --> 03:38:18,682
Tell her the guy you made us con
was the only decent guy she ever met?

1425
03:38:18,852 --> 03:38:20,729
This is just too sick!

1426
03:38:20,892 --> 03:38:24,202
I thought this revenge thing would
be fun, but you've ruined it.

1427
03:38:24,372 --> 03:38:26,840
- I don't want this guy's money.
- I don't either.

1428
03:38:27,012 --> 03:38:28,730
- I'm not taking it.
- Neither am I.

1429
03:38:28,892 --> 03:38:30,405
- Neither am I!
- I'll take it.

1430
03:38:30,572 --> 03:38:32,483
- What?
- You said you didn't want it.

1431
03:38:32,652 --> 03:38:34,370
You should tell Page the truth.

1432
03:38:34,532 --> 03:38:37,729
What for? He's only gonna end up
hurting her anyway.

1433
03:38:37,892 --> 03:38:40,406
She's better off with me.
I'll protect her.

1434
03:38:40,572 --> 03:38:42,767
From what? From love?

1435
03:38:42,932 --> 03:38:45,571
- From pain.
- Love is pain!

1436
03:38:45,732 --> 03:38:49,520
Life is pain. You can't protect
anybody. It's always gonna get you.

1437
03:38:49,692 --> 03:38:51,489
Sometimes life can also be good.

1438
03:38:51,652 --> 03:38:55,361
But you gotta be open, you gotta
take chances, you gotta let go!

1439
03:38:55,532 --> 03:38:58,285
What self-help guru moron
taught you that?

1440
03:38:58,452 --> 03:39:00,761
Nobody had to teach me.
It's common sense.

1441
03:39:00,932 --> 03:39:02,763
And Deepak Chopra is not a moron!

1442
03:39:02,932 --> 03:39:04,729
I've seen a lot of crap in my life,

1443
03:39:04,892 --> 03:39:08,168
but the way you're cheating her
out of a decent future, it sucks!

1444
03:39:08,332 --> 03:39:12,325
Of all the lousy things you've done,
you should be most ashamed of that.

1445
03:39:12,492 --> 03:39:15,689
And what you did to me, too.
I don't want to leave that out.

1446
03:39:16,132 --> 03:39:18,407
- Here's your money.
- I don't want it.

1447
03:39:18,572 --> 03:39:21,211
- Good luck with psycho mom.
- What was that?

1448
03:39:21,372 --> 03:39:23,124
- I took care of it.
- How?

1449
03:39:23,292 --> 03:39:26,170
I don't want to talk about it.
Let's just get out of here.

1450
03:39:27,532 --> 03:39:30,763
So where are we going?
Seattle or San Francisco?

1451
03:39:32,252 --> 03:39:34,447
You know, you don't
have to stay with me.

1452
03:39:34,612 --> 03:39:38,400
There's plenty of money for you to
set up on your own. You can have it.

1453
03:39:38,572 --> 03:39:40,244
Thanks, Mom,

1454
03:39:40,412 --> 03:39:43,848
but you're the only person
in this world I even half trust.

1455
03:39:50,092 --> 03:39:51,445
What are you doing?

1456
03:39:51,612 --> 03:39:53,125
- Turning around.
- Why?

1457
03:39:54,412 --> 03:39:57,324
- Promise you won't attack me?
- What is it?

1458
03:39:57,492 --> 03:40:00,052
We're travelling at speed.
It would endanger us.

1459
03:40:00,212 --> 03:40:02,009
What is it?

1460
03:40:03,532 --> 03:40:06,410
Jack turned me down.

1461
03:40:07,252 --> 03:40:08,731
So I kinda...

1462
03:40:09,852 --> 03:40:11,524
I micked him.

1463
03:40:20,452 --> 03:40:23,524
You are the most evil, manipulative...

1464
03:40:23,692 --> 03:40:25,648
You're right. I am.

1465
03:40:26,132 --> 03:40:29,966
I've just been so afraid of losing you
or of you getting hurt like me.

1466
03:40:30,132 --> 03:40:32,043
But I can't protect you.

1467
03:40:32,212 --> 03:40:35,010
I just get you hurt
in different, sick ways.

1468
03:40:35,172 --> 03:40:38,767
So you might as well get hurt
in your own healthy, normal ways -

1469
03:40:38,932 --> 03:40:41,890
ways you come up with on your own
and can't blame me for.

1470
03:40:51,452 --> 03:40:53,044
Oh, it's a hug.

1471
03:40:53,212 --> 03:40:54,930
I can pull over for a hug.

1472
03:41:02,332 --> 03:41:06,166
Don't cry too much or you'll look
like hell when you go back to him.

1473
03:41:06,332 --> 03:41:08,163
You should wear the blue dress.

1474
03:41:08,332 --> 03:41:10,004
Mom.

1475
03:41:11,212 --> 03:41:13,726
Right. Wear whatever you want.

1476
03:41:14,852 --> 03:41:16,843
Except what you're wearing.

1477
03:41:31,012 --> 03:41:32,843
What are you doing here?

1478
03:41:33,012 --> 03:41:35,082
You know what I'm doing here.

1479
03:41:35,252 --> 03:41:37,482
You thought I'd want you
after what you did?

1480
03:41:37,652 --> 03:41:39,324
You don't? OK, fine.

1481
03:41:39,492 --> 03:41:41,608
All right. Wait, wait, OK, fine.

1482
03:41:41,772 --> 03:41:43,763
So I still want you.

1483
03:41:43,932 --> 03:41:45,411
No kidding.

1484
03:41:48,812 --> 03:41:52,725
But don't you ever
cheat on me again. Ever. Ever!

1485
03:41:52,892 --> 03:41:54,723
- OK, fine!
- I mean it.

1486
03:41:54,892 --> 03:41:59,249
If you see some gorgeous girl giving
you that ''Let's screw around'' look,

1487
03:41:59,412 --> 03:42:03,041
just remember
she may be working for me.

1488
03:42:04,332 --> 03:42:06,687
All right, fine! But you!

1489
03:42:06,852 --> 03:42:09,412
No more conning! No more!

1490
03:42:09,572 --> 03:42:13,884
As my wife, you gotta live
a respectable life - chopping cars.

1491
03:42:15,212 --> 03:42:17,521
First you gotta help me
with one thing.

1492
03:42:17,692 --> 03:42:19,410
No. First you gotta help me.

1493
03:42:28,972 --> 03:42:30,405
OK.

1494
03:42:33,292 --> 03:42:35,931
You're not gonna fall asleep on me
again, are you?

1495
03:42:36,092 --> 03:42:38,048
I feel pretty good about tonight.

1496
03:42:49,132 --> 03:42:51,851
I don't wanna go in there.
The bank owns it now.

1497
03:42:52,012 --> 03:42:54,845
- There's some stuff left.
- I cleared out everything.

1498
03:43:03,652 --> 03:43:05,051
Surprise!

1499
03:43:19,172 --> 03:43:20,685
Jane?

1500
03:43:38,572 --> 03:43:42,281
- How...?
- My name is Page.

1501
03:43:58,052 --> 03:44:00,486
I never realised I could feel
this way again.

1502
03:44:00,652 --> 03:44:03,485
That I could be so totally in love
with someone.

1503
03:44:03,652 --> 03:44:06,849
Oh, I feel the same way, Stanley.
