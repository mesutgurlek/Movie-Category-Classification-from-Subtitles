00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:03,022
Have we met before?

172
00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:04,719
I've seen you before,

173
00:15:04,794 --> 00:15:07,092
although you may
not have seen me.

174
00:15:07,163 --> 00:15:09,063
You live in Washington, too?

175
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:10,564
Sure do.

176
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:13,568
Does anyone not live
in Washington?

177
00:15:13,636 --> 00:15:14,933
I don't.

178
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:17,768
But you have a government job.

179
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,435
Anyone not earn their living
from the government,

180
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,205
one way or another?

181
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:26,781
Where's our host,
and why are we here?

182
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:28,282
[Doorbell Rings]

183
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:35,389
[Wadsworth]
Ah, good evening.

184
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,891
You're eagerly awaited.

185
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,392
Are you locking me in?

186
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:40,156
I'll take the key.

187
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:41,662
Over my dead body, sir.

188
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,061
May I take your bag?

189
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:45,225
No. I'll leave it here.

190
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:47,394
It contains evidence, I presume?

191
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,802
It contains surprises, my friend.

192
00:15:51,373 --> 00:15:52,738
Ladies and gentlemen,

193
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:54,207
may I present Mr. Boddy.

194
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:58,112
What are they doing here?

195
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,613
Eating dinner.

196
00:15:59,682 --> 00:16:01,616
Do sit down, Mr. Boddy.

197
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:02,708
Thanks.

198
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:06,746
Take that away, honey.

199
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:15,596
Look! I demand to know
what's going on.

200
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:17,598
Why have we been dragged here?

201
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:21,932
Well, I believe
we all received a letter.

202
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:23,335
My letter says,

203
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:27,603
''It will be to your advantage
to be present.

204
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:31,612
Mr. Boddy will end
a long-standing, confidential,

205
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,614
and painful financial liability.''

206
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:34,979
Signed, ''A friend.''

207
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,381
I received a similar letter.

208
00:16:36,452 --> 00:16:37,646
So did we.

209
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,154
I also received a letter.

210
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:41,655
No, thanks, Yvette.

211
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:43,123
I just ate.

212
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:44,784
You know her?

213
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,589
We know each other.

214
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:47,856
Don't we, dear?

215
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:52,767
Did your letter
say the same thing?

216
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:53,927
No.

217
00:16:54,003 --> 00:16:55,436
I see.

218
00:16:55,504 --> 00:16:59,998
Can I interest anyone
in fruit or dessert?

219
00:17:02,444 --> 00:17:05,379
Then we'll adjourn to the study

220
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:07,381
for coffee and brandy,

221
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:10,850
where our unknown host
will reveal his intentions.

222
00:17:13,956 --> 00:17:15,890
There's no one here.

223
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,894
Please help yourself to brandy
and be seated.

224
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:31,372
Mind if I smoke?

225
00:17:50,492 --> 00:17:51,982
Ladies and gentlemen,

226
00:17:52,061 --> 00:17:55,997
I'm to explain what you have
in common with each other.

227
00:17:56,065 --> 00:17:58,727
Unless you would care to, Mr. Boddy?

228
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:01,167
Why me?
Do they know who I am?

229
00:18:01,237 --> 00:18:03,762
No. You've never
identified yourself.

230
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,364
It's a hoax.
I suggest we leave.

231
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:08,842
I'm sorry.
You cannot leave this house!

232
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:10,276
Who'll stop me?

233
00:18:10,346 --> 00:18:12,280
There's no way out.
The windows have bars.

234
00:18:12,348 --> 00:18:14,509
The doors are locked.

235
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,847
You can't hold us prisoner!

236
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:18,284
He's right!

237
00:18:18,354 --> 00:18:20,845
Please return to the study.

238
00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:22,413
Everything will be explained.

239
00:18:23,726 --> 00:18:25,626
You, too, Mr. Boddy.

240
00:18:25,694 --> 00:18:27,161
Other way!

241
00:18:35,304 --> 00:18:37,135
You can't get out.

242
00:18:37,206 --> 00:18:38,434
It's only glass.

243
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:05,199
You all have one thing in common.

244
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:06,734
You're all being blackmailed.

245
00:19:06,802 --> 00:19:08,235
For some time,

246
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:12,240
you've been paying
more than you can afford

247
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:15,243
to someone threatening
to expose you,

248
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:17,745
and you don't know who.

249
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:19,246
That's ridiculous!

250
00:19:19,315 --> 00:19:21,249
Nobody could blackmail me.

251
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:24,115
I've never done anything wrong.

252
00:19:26,155 --> 00:19:29,090
Anybody else wish to deny it?

253
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:34,928
Very well.

254
00:19:34,997 --> 00:19:37,192
As everyone here
is in the same boat,

255
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:40,201
I'll reveal some details,
as instructed.

256
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:41,861
Thank you, Yvette.

257
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:52,170
You might spare us
this humiliation.

258
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:54,181
I'm sorry.

259
00:19:54,249 --> 00:19:56,683
Professor Plum, you were once

260
00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:58,686
a professor of psychiatry,

261
00:19:58,754 --> 00:20:00,688
specializing in homicidal lunatics

262
00:20:00,756 --> 00:20:02,690
suffering from
delusions of grandeur.

263
00:20:02,758 --> 00:20:04,692
But now I'm with
the United Nations.

264
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,695
No change.
But you don't practice medicine.

265
00:20:07,763 --> 00:20:10,197
His license to practice
has been lifted.

266
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:12,597
What did he do?

267
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:16,468
What doctors mustn't do
with their lady patients.

268
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:18,563
Oh, how disgusting!

269
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,076
Are you making moral judgments,
Mrs. Peacock?

270
00:20:22,144 --> 00:20:24,578
How then do you
justify taking bribes

271
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:27,581
in return for delivering
Senator Peacock's vote to lobbyists?

272
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:29,082
My husband's a paid consultant.

273
00:20:29,151 --> 00:20:30,584
There's nothing wrong with that.

274
00:20:30,652 --> 00:20:32,244
Not if it's publicly declared.

275
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:34,255
But if the payment is delivered

276
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:35,756
by slipping used greenbacks

277
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:38,258
under the door of the men's room,

278
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:39,760
how would you describe that?

279
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:41,159
I'd say it stinks.

280
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,993
How would you know?

281
00:20:43,065 --> 00:20:44,396
So it's true?

282
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,900
No. It's a vicious lie!

283
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:50,405
You've been paying blackmail
for over a year

284
00:20:50,472 --> 00:20:53,407
to keep that story
out of the papers.

285
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:55,909
I believe you.
I'm being blackmailed

286
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:57,843
for something I didn't do.

287
00:20:57,913 --> 00:20:59,346
- Me, too.
- And me.

288
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:00,848
Not me.

289
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,281
You're not?

290
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:05,218
I did what I'm being
blackmailed for.

291
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:06,720
What did you do?

292
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:08,222
To be perfectly frank,

293
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,224
I run a hotel which provides

294
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:12,817
gentlemen with the company
of a young lady

295
00:21:12,895 --> 00:21:14,453
for a short while.

296
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,997
Oh, yeah?

297
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:17,998
What's the phone number?

298
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:22,570
Was Colonel Mustard
one of your clients?

299
00:21:22,638 --> 00:21:25,072
Tell them that's not true.

300
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,505
It's not true.

301
00:21:26,575 --> 00:21:27,507
Really?

302
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:28,508
No.

303
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:30,807
Aha! A double negative.

304
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:32,676
Do you have photographs?

305
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:35,182
That sounds like a confession.

306
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,343
You gave yourself away.

307
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:39,979
Are you trying to
make me look stupid?

308
00:21:40,055 --> 00:21:41,317
You don't need help.

309
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,085
That's right!

310
00:21:43,158 --> 00:21:46,093
What's so terrible
about Colonel Mustard

311
00:21:46,161 --> 00:21:49,096
visiting a house of ill fame?

312
00:21:49,164 --> 00:21:53,362
He holds a sensitive security post
in the Pentagon.

313
00:21:53,435 --> 00:21:57,428
You drive an expensive car
for a colonel.

314
00:21:57,506 --> 00:21:59,940
I came into money during the war

315
00:22:00,008 --> 00:22:02,203
when I lost my mommy and daddy.

316
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:04,544
Mrs. White,

317
00:22:04,613 --> 00:22:06,342
you've paid the blackmailer

318
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:09,714
ever since your husband
died mysteriously.

319
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:12,952
Why is that funny?

320
00:22:13,021 --> 00:22:16,548
That's why he was
lying on his back.

321
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,217
I didn't kill him.

322
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:19,954
Then why are you
paying the blackmailer?

323
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:22,053
I don't want a scandal.

324
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,064
We had a humiliating confrontation.

325
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:25,565
He was deranged.

326
00:22:25,634 --> 00:22:27,261
He was a lunatic.

327
00:22:27,336 --> 00:22:29,236
He didn't like me.

328
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:32,034
He threatened
to kill me in public.

329
00:22:32,107 --> 00:22:33,540
Why kill you in public?

330
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:36,077
He threatened in public
to kill her.

331
00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:38,738
Oh. Was that his final word?

332
00:22:38,814 --> 00:22:41,214
Being killed
is pretty final, right?

333
00:22:41,283 --> 00:22:44,741
He was the one
who died, not you.

334
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,412
What was his profession?

335
00:22:46,488 --> 00:22:48,922
He was a scientist.
Nuclear physics.

336
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:50,754
What was he like?

337
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:53,260
He was always
a stupidly optimistic man.

338
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:57,264
It was a shock
to him when he died.

339
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:59,766
His head had been cut off.

340
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:01,769
And so had his, uh...

341
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:03,361
you know.

342
00:23:03,438 --> 00:23:05,872
I had been out all evening.

343
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:08,000
Do you miss him?

344
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:11,910
Now that he's dead,
I have a life.

345
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,379
He was your second husband.

346
00:23:13,448 --> 00:23:15,382
Your first husband also disappeared.

347
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,418
He was an illusionist.

348
00:23:17,486 --> 00:23:19,147
But he never reappeared.

349
00:23:19,221 --> 00:23:21,348
He wasn't a very good illusionist.

350
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:24,691
I have something to say.

351
00:23:26,194 --> 00:23:29,721
I won't wait for Wadsworth
to unmask me.

352
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:32,232
I work for the State Department,

353
00:23:32,301 --> 00:23:33,529
and I'm a homosexual.

354
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:40,238
I feel no shame
or guilt about this,

355
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:43,745
but I must keep it a secret

356
00:23:43,812 --> 00:23:47,248
or I'll lose my job
on security grounds.

357
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:48,749
Thank you.

358
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,253
Well...

359
00:23:54,957 --> 00:23:57,824
that just leaves Mr. Boddy.

360
00:23:57,893 --> 00:23:59,258
What's your secret?

361
00:23:59,328 --> 00:24:00,761
Haven't you guessed?

362
00:24:00,829 --> 00:24:02,854
He's the one blackmailing you.

363
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:05,866
You bastard!

364
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:07,367
Put 'em up!

365
00:24:07,436 --> 00:24:08,698
Put 'em up!

366
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:11,000
Gentlemen...

367
00:24:11,073 --> 00:24:13,041
if you can't fight fairly,

368
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:15,201
don't fight at all.

369
00:24:15,277 --> 00:24:17,711
Nobody calls me a bastard!

370
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:21,215
Was that necessary,
Mrs. White?

371
00:24:21,283 --> 00:24:22,511
Wait, wait!

372
00:24:22,584 --> 00:24:24,552
The police are coming.

373
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,588
- No, no!
- Oh, no!

374
00:24:26,655 --> 00:24:28,213
Listen!

375
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,224
Blackmail depends on secrecy.

376
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:32,226
You've admitted
he's blackmailed you.

377
00:24:32,294 --> 00:24:35,730
Tell the police,
and he'll be convicted.

378
00:24:35,797 --> 00:24:37,458
It's not so easy.

379
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:41,232
You'll never tell the police.

380
00:24:41,303 --> 00:24:42,736
Then I shall.

381
00:24:42,804 --> 00:24:46,399
This conversation
is being tape recorded.

382
00:24:46,475 --> 00:24:47,942
<i>Point of order!</i>

383
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,240
<i>Tape recordings aren't</i>
<i>admissible evidence.</i>

384
00:24:50,312 --> 00:24:53,247
The police arrive in 45 minutes.

385
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:55,715
Tell them the truth,

386
00:24:55,784 --> 00:24:59,481
and Mr. Boddy will be behind bars.

387
00:24:59,554 --> 00:25:01,249
Where are you going?

388
00:25:01,323 --> 00:25:03,188
I can help them decide.

389
00:25:03,258 --> 00:25:05,123
Can I get my bag?

390
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:17,705
Who can guess what's in here?

391
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:20,207
The evidence against us, no doubt.

392
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:23,039
Did you know you were meeting us?

393
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:24,203
Yes.

394
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:26,474
What were you told, precisely?

395
00:25:26,548 --> 00:25:29,711
That you were meeting
to discuss our arrangements.

396
00:25:29,785 --> 00:25:31,719
If I didn't appear,

397
00:25:31,787 --> 00:25:33,721
Wadsworth would inform the police.

398
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:35,723
I could hardly resist

399
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:37,725
putting in an appearance.

400
00:25:39,294 --> 00:25:41,660
Excuse me.

401
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,755
Open them.

402
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,733
Why not?

403
00:25:48,804 --> 00:25:52,740
I enjoy getting presents
from strange men.

404
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:03,181
A candlestick?

405
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:05,185
What's this for?

406
00:26:50,465 --> 00:26:52,228
In your hands,

407
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,666
you each have a lethal weapon.

408
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:59,740
If you denounce me to the police,

409
00:26:59,808 --> 00:27:02,675
you will also be
exposed and humiliated.

410
00:27:02,744 --> 00:27:05,679
I'll see to that in court.

411
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:08,682
But...

412
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,583
if one of you
kills Wadsworth now,

413
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:16,181
no one but the seven
of us will ever know.

414
00:27:16,258 --> 00:27:19,694
He has the key
to the front door,

415
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:22,696
which he said
would only be opened

416
00:27:22,764 --> 00:27:24,322
over his dead body.

417
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:32,206
I suggest we take him up
on that offer.

418
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:41,715
To avoid finding yourselves
on the front pages,

419
00:27:41,783 --> 00:27:45,048
one of you better
kill Wadsworth...now.

420
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:47,554
[Thump]

421
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:49,214
[Moan]

422
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,724
[Gunshot]

423
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:52,225
Aaahh!

424
00:27:56,031 --> 00:27:57,191
It's not Wadsworth!

425
00:27:57,265 --> 00:27:58,857
Is he alive?

426
00:27:58,934 --> 00:27:59,866
Mr. Boddy.

427
00:27:59,935 --> 00:28:01,402
Stand back!

428
00:28:01,469 --> 00:28:02,834
Let me see.

429
00:28:09,244 --> 00:28:10,677
He's dead!

430
00:28:10,745 --> 00:28:12,178
Who had the gun?

431
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:13,680
I did.

432
00:28:13,748 --> 00:28:15,181
You shot him!

433
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,182
I didn't!

434
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:18,685
If you didn't shoot him,
who did?

435
00:28:19,754 --> 00:28:21,813
Nobody!
There's no gunshot wound.

436
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:25,189
Somebody grabbed the gun,
and it went off.

437
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,694
Look!
The bullet broke that vase.

438
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:28,694
Excuse me.

439
00:28:28,763 --> 00:28:30,196
He's absolutely right.

440
00:28:30,265 --> 00:28:32,199
There's a bullet hole.

441
00:28:32,267 --> 00:28:34,701
How did he die?

442
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:36,202
I don't know!

443
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:38,705
I'm not a forensic expert!

444
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:41,207
Someone here must have killed him.

445
00:28:41,276 --> 00:28:42,709
I didn't do it.

446
00:28:42,777 --> 00:28:44,711
I need a drink.

447
00:28:47,782 --> 00:28:49,750
Maybe he was poisoned.

448
00:28:49,818 --> 00:28:52,912
Aah!

449
00:28:52,988 --> 00:28:54,717
Aah!

450
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:56,723
Mrs. Peacock, it's all right.

451
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:58,725
We don't know anything.

452
00:28:58,793 --> 00:29:00,954
Sit down.
Sit down.

453
00:29:02,464 --> 00:29:05,524
I had to stop her
from screaming.

454
00:29:07,002 --> 00:29:08,993
Was the brandy poisoned?

455
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,503
I don't know.

456
00:29:13,241 --> 00:29:15,175
Looks like we'll never know.

457
00:29:15,243 --> 00:29:16,676
Unless...

458
00:29:16,745 --> 00:29:18,679
unless she dies, too.

459
00:29:23,752 --> 00:29:25,845
Aah!

460
00:29:27,756 --> 00:29:30,350
Aah!

461
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,693
Aah!

462
00:29:35,263 --> 00:29:36,696
It's locked.

463
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:38,198
Open up.

464
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:39,699
It's the murderer!

465
00:29:39,768 --> 00:29:41,201
He's got Yvette!

466
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:43,100
Oh, my God!

467
00:29:46,274 --> 00:29:48,105
You're alive.

468
00:29:48,176 --> 00:29:49,609
No thanks to you.

469
00:29:49,678 --> 00:29:51,805
There's a murderer here.

470
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,711
The murderer's in this room?

471
00:29:53,782 --> 00:29:55,147
But where?

472
00:29:55,216 --> 00:29:56,808
Where? Here.

473
00:29:56,885 --> 00:29:59,911
We're looking at him...or her!

474
00:29:59,988 --> 00:30:02,149
Like Mrs. White said,

475
00:30:02,223 --> 00:30:03,713
somebody here is a killer!

476
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:05,350
How did you know?

477
00:30:05,427 --> 00:30:06,587
I was listening.

478
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:09,755
Why were you screaming
all by yourself?

479
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:11,731
Because I am frightened.

480
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,734
I also drink the cognac.

481
00:30:13,802 --> 00:30:16,202
I can't stay here by myself.

482
00:30:17,806 --> 00:30:20,741
Come back to the study with us.

483
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:22,242
With the murderer?

484
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,744
There's safety in numbers, my dear.

485
00:30:38,827 --> 00:30:41,762
There's no indication
of how he died?

486
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,263
No.

487
00:30:43,331 --> 00:30:44,764
This is absolutely terrible.

488
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,767
It's not what I'd intended.

489
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:47,995
My God!

490
00:30:48,069 --> 00:30:49,468
Not what you intended?

491
00:30:49,537 --> 00:30:51,437
You're not the butler?

492
00:30:51,506 --> 00:30:52,996
I'm not <i>the</i> butler,

493
00:30:53,074 --> 00:30:55,338
but I am a butler, <i>his</i> butler.

494
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:59,176
If he told you to invite us,
why was he late?

495
00:30:59,247 --> 00:31:01,272
I invited you.
I wrote the letters.

496
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:03,214
It was all my idea.

497
00:31:03,284 --> 00:31:04,717
Wait a minute.

498
00:31:04,786 --> 00:31:06,720
I--I don't understand.

499
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:09,723
Were you assisting
your late employer

500
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,281
to blackmail us?

501
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,724
Certainly not!

502
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:14,955
I think you'd better explain.

503
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,225
Please sit down, everyone.

504
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:40,254
When I said I was
Mr. Boddy's butler,

505
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:41,754
this was misleading.

506
00:31:41,823 --> 00:31:43,757
I was once his butler,

507
00:31:43,825 --> 00:31:47,090
but his death didn't
end my employment.

508
00:31:47,162 --> 00:31:48,629
What did end it?

509
00:31:48,696 --> 00:31:50,755
When my wife decided to...

510
00:31:50,832 --> 00:31:52,265
end her life.

511
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,267
She, too, was being blackmailed

512
00:31:54,335 --> 00:31:56,269
by this odious man.

513
00:31:56,337 --> 00:31:58,271
He hated my wife

514
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:01,274
for the same reason
he hated all of you--

515
00:32:01,342 --> 00:32:04,175
He believed you were
thoroughly un-American.

516
00:32:07,782 --> 00:32:09,249
I'm sorry.

517
00:32:09,317 --> 00:32:11,217
He felt it was inappropriate

518
00:32:11,286 --> 00:32:14,722
for a senator
to have a corrupt wife,

519
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:17,724
for a doctor
to abuse his patients,

520
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:20,226
for a wife
to emasculate her husband,

521
00:32:20,295 --> 00:32:21,819
and--and...so forth.

522
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:26,060
If he was so patriotic,
why didn't he report us?

523
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:29,228
He decided to make a little money.

524
00:32:29,304 --> 00:32:32,330
What could be
more American than that?

525
00:32:32,407 --> 00:32:33,840
What was your role?

526
00:32:33,908 --> 00:32:36,240
I was a victim, too.

527
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:38,745
At least, my wife was.

528
00:32:38,813 --> 00:32:41,247
She had friends who were...

529
00:32:42,817 --> 00:32:44,478
socialists.

530
00:32:44,552 --> 00:32:46,747
Oh, my God.

531
00:32:50,825 --> 00:32:52,258
Well...

532
00:32:52,327 --> 00:32:54,227
we all make mistakes.

533
00:33:04,272 --> 00:33:06,206
Mr. Boddy threatened
to turn her in

534
00:33:06,274 --> 00:33:08,208
unless she named the socialists.

535
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:10,710
She refused, so he blackmailed her.

536
00:33:10,778 --> 00:33:12,712
The price of his silence

537
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,682
was that we work for him for nothing.
We were slaves.

538
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:19,515
To make a long story short...

539
00:33:19,587 --> 00:33:21,418
Too late.

540
00:33:21,489 --> 00:33:23,218
my wife's suicide
preyed on my mind

541
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:26,727
and created a sense
of injustice in me.

542
00:33:26,794 --> 00:33:30,230
I resolved to put Mr. Boddy
behind bars.

543
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:33,734
The best way to do this and
free you from blackmail

544
00:33:33,801 --> 00:33:36,736
was to get everyone
face to face,

545
00:33:36,804 --> 00:33:39,238
confront Mr. Boddy
with his crimes,

546
00:33:39,307 --> 00:33:41,070
and turn him in.

547
00:33:41,142 --> 00:33:42,439
Everything's explained.

548
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,909
Nothing's explained.

549
00:33:43,978 --> 00:33:46,412
We don't know
who killed him.

550
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:48,415
We've got to find out
in 39 minutes

551
00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:49,916
before the police arrive.

552
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:52,612
We can't have them come now.

553
00:33:52,687 --> 00:33:54,746
Which of you did it?

554
00:33:54,822 --> 00:33:56,756
What do you mean, ''you''?

555
00:33:56,824 --> 00:33:58,758
Well, I didn't do it!

556
00:33:58,826 --> 00:34:01,454
One of us did.
We all had a motive.

557
00:34:01,529 --> 00:34:03,087
Great!
We'll all get the chair.

558
00:34:03,164 --> 00:34:05,132
- Maybe it wasn't us!
- Who else?

559
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,690
Who else is here?

560
00:34:06,768 --> 00:34:08,702
- Only the cook!
- Only the cook!

561
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:41,666
Well, she's not here.

562
00:34:41,736 --> 00:34:43,727
Aah!

563
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:47,240
I didn't do it!

564
00:34:47,308 --> 00:34:49,242
Somebody help me, please.

565
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,244
Somebody help me, please.

566
00:34:57,819 --> 00:34:59,252
Don't touch it.

567
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,753
That's evidence.

568
00:35:00,822 --> 00:35:02,687
Not for us.

569
00:35:02,757 --> 00:35:04,691
We can't take fingerprints.

570
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:06,693
Explain yourself, Wadsworth.

571
00:35:06,761 --> 00:35:08,058
Me? Why me?

572
00:35:08,129 --> 00:35:09,687
Why kill the cook?

573
00:35:09,764 --> 00:35:11,197
Dinner wasn't that bad.

574
00:35:11,266 --> 00:35:13,200
How can you make jokes?

575
00:35:13,268 --> 00:35:14,929
It's my defense mechanism.

576
00:35:15,003 --> 00:35:18,564
If I was the killer,
I'd kill you next.

577
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,508
I said <i>if.</i>

578
00:35:24,045 --> 00:35:26,036
There's one admitted killer here.

579
00:35:26,114 --> 00:35:27,547
It is her.

580
00:35:27,615 --> 00:35:29,048
I've admitted nothing.

581
00:35:29,117 --> 00:35:31,551
How many husbands
have you had?

582
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,052
Mine or other women's?

583
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:34,053
Yours.

584
00:35:34,122 --> 00:35:35,384
Just the five.

585
00:35:35,456 --> 00:35:37,390
Husbands should be like Kleenex--

586
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:38,823
soft, strong, and disposable.

587
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:41,828
You're like a spider luring flies.

588
00:35:41,896 --> 00:35:44,729
Flies are where men
are most vulnerable.

589
00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:47,734
If it wasn't you,
who was it?

590
00:35:47,802 --> 00:35:49,235
Who had the dagger?

591
00:35:49,304 --> 00:35:50,737
You, Mrs. Peacock.

592
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:54,241
Yes. I put it down
in the study.

593
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:55,401
When?

594
00:35:55,476 --> 00:35:57,410
Before...or after I fainted.

595
00:35:57,478 --> 00:36:00,914
Any of you could
have picked it up.

596
00:36:00,982 --> 00:36:05,351
I suggest we take the cook's body
into the study.

597
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,512
Why?

598
00:36:06,587 --> 00:36:10,023
Butlers like keeping
the kitchen tidy.

599
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:17,697
Look!

600
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:19,858
The body's gone!

601
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:22,095
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing.

602
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,104
- Well, who's there?
- Nobody.

603
00:36:24,172 --> 00:36:25,605
What do you mean?

604
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:27,868
I mean no body.
Boddy's body's gone.

605
00:36:27,942 --> 00:36:29,239
He was dead!

606
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,244
We should've made sure.

607
00:36:31,312 --> 00:36:34,110
How?
By cutting his head off?

608
00:36:34,182 --> 00:36:36,582
We'd better look for him.

609
00:36:47,895 --> 00:36:49,328
Well.

610
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:51,831
He couldn't have been dead.

611
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:55,335
He was.
At least, I thought he was.

612
00:36:55,403 --> 00:36:57,894
What difference
does it make now?

613
00:36:57,972 --> 00:36:59,940
Makes a difference to him.

614
00:37:00,007 --> 00:37:02,840
Maybe there is life after death.

615
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,844
Life after death's as improbable

616
00:37:04,912 --> 00:37:07,073
as sex after marriage.

617
00:37:07,148 --> 00:37:10,345
Maybe Mr. Boddy killed the cook!

618
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:11,350
- Yes!
- Yes!

619
00:37:11,419 --> 00:37:13,011
How?

620
00:37:13,087 --> 00:37:14,111
Uh...

621
00:37:18,726 --> 00:37:20,523
Excuse me.
I have to...

622
00:37:20,595 --> 00:37:24,361
Is there a little girl's room
in the hall?

623
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:25,865
<i>Oui, oui, madame.</i>

624
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:29,369
No, I just want to
powder my nose.

625
00:37:31,072 --> 00:37:32,369
What's this, Wadsworth?

626
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,876
The negatives to which
Colonel Mustard earlier referred.

627
00:37:35,943 --> 00:37:38,377
You planning to
blackmail him, Wadsworth?

628
00:37:38,446 --> 00:37:42,382
No! I planned on
returning them to the colonel

629
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,384
when Mr. Boddy was unmasked.

630
00:37:44,452 --> 00:37:48,183
Very pretty.
Want to see these, Yvette?

631
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:50,053
No. I am a lady.

632
00:37:50,124 --> 00:37:52,058
What sort of pictures?

633
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:55,061
They're my pictures.
I'd like them back.

634
00:37:55,129 --> 00:37:57,563
No. Something in them
concerns me.

635
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,065
Let me see.

636
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:02,000
Nobody can get
into that position.

637
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:03,502
Sure they can.

638
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:05,505
Let me show you.

639
00:38:05,573 --> 00:38:07,234
Get off me.

640
00:38:07,308 --> 00:38:09,833
Aah!

641
00:38:15,683 --> 00:38:16,980
It's Mr. Boddy!

642
00:38:17,051 --> 00:38:19,349
He's attacking her.

643
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,512
Aah!

644
00:38:23,424 --> 00:38:25,358
No. No, he's dead.

645
00:38:25,426 --> 00:38:27,792
Mr. Boddy. Dead...again!

646
00:38:27,862 --> 00:38:29,090
Oh, my God.

647
00:38:29,163 --> 00:38:30,596
She's fainting.

648
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:32,098
Somebody catch her!

649
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:33,827
I'll catch her.

650
00:38:35,736 --> 00:38:36,828
Sorry.

651
00:38:36,904 --> 00:38:38,269
You've got blood
on your hands.

652
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,640
I didn't do it!

653
00:38:42,743 --> 00:38:44,574
He's certainly dead now.

654
00:38:44,645 --> 00:38:48,479
Why would anyone
want to kill him twice?

655
00:38:48,549 --> 00:38:49,880
Seems so unnecessary.

656
00:38:49,951 --> 00:38:52,249
What we call overkill.

657
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,151
Unless he wasn't dead before.

658
00:38:54,222 --> 00:38:55,655
What's the difference?

659
00:38:55,723 --> 00:38:58,157
That's what we're trying
to find out--

660
00:38:58,226 --> 00:39:00,660
who killed him, where,
and with what!

661
00:39:00,728 --> 00:39:02,457
No need to shout!

662
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,794
I'm not shouting!

663
00:39:04,866 --> 00:39:06,800
All right, I am!

664
00:39:06,868 --> 00:39:09,769
I'm shouting!
I'm shouting! I'm shou--

665
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:23,544
Okay, put the corpses on the sofa.

666
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:26,018
Ladies first.

667
00:39:37,665 --> 00:39:40,532
Careful.
Don't get blood on the sofa.

668
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:42,535
How do we do this?

669
00:39:42,603 --> 00:39:45,367
Tip her forward over the arm.

670
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:51,903
Now Mr. Boddy.

671
00:39:54,415 --> 00:39:55,473
Ready.

672
00:39:58,419 --> 00:39:59,852
A little higher.

673
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:01,320
There we go.

674
00:40:05,426 --> 00:40:06,358
Now.

675
00:40:06,427 --> 00:40:07,485
Who...

676
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,364
Who had access
to the candlestick?

677
00:40:11,432 --> 00:40:12,364
Everybody.

678
00:40:12,433 --> 00:40:14,367
It was given to you.

679
00:40:14,435 --> 00:40:15,868
I dropped it.

680
00:40:15,937 --> 00:40:17,871
Anyone could've picked it up.

681
00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:19,873
We still have these weapons--

682
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:22,375
the gun, rope, wrench, lead pipe.

683
00:40:22,443 --> 00:40:25,879
Let's put them in this cupboard
and lock it.

684
00:40:25,947 --> 00:40:28,108
There's a homicidal maniac about.

685
00:40:28,182 --> 00:40:29,706
- Good idea.
- Good idea.

686
00:40:29,784 --> 00:40:33,880
I'm putting the key
in my pocket for safety.

687
00:40:33,955 --> 00:40:36,890
You can open it
whenever you want.

688
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:38,926
What if you're the murderer?

689
00:40:38,993 --> 00:40:40,426
I'm not.

690
00:40:40,494 --> 00:40:43,827
If I've got it,
I know I'm safe.

691
00:40:43,898 --> 00:40:45,991
We don't know that we are.

692
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:48,001
We'll throw it away.

00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,764

- Right away!

695
00:40:55,977 --> 00:40:57,001
Sorry.

696
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,607
Sorry.

697
00:41:00,681 --> 00:41:02,080
Can we help?

698
00:41:02,149 --> 00:41:05,050
I didn't mean
to disturb the household.

699
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,053
My car broke down.

700
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:10,989
I was wondering
if I could use your phone.

701
00:41:11,058 --> 00:41:12,457
Just a moment.

00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,373
Very well, sir.

706
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:33,879
What, the body?

707
00:41:33,948 --> 00:41:35,381
The phone. What body?

708
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:37,883
There's nobody... in the study,

709
00:41:37,952 --> 00:41:40,887
But there's a phone
in the lounge.

710
00:41:40,955 --> 00:41:42,354
Thank you.

711
00:41:48,963 --> 00:41:52,899
When you're finished,
be good enough to wait here.

712
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:54,525

00:42:06,747 --> 00:42:07,839
Aah!

Where's the key?

In my pocket.

717
00:42:10,918 --> 00:42:12,180
The cupboard key.

718
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:14,414
Should I still dispose of it?

719
00:42:14,488 --> 00:42:15,420
- Yes!
- Yes!

720
00:42:28,436 --> 00:42:29,869
Well...

721
00:42:29,937 --> 00:42:31,370
what now?

722
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:32,872
Let me out.

723
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,374
No. We're all
in this together.

724
00:42:35,443 --> 00:42:36,876
If you leave,

725
00:42:36,944 --> 00:42:39,378
I'll say you killed
them both.

- Me, too.
- Me, too.

You'll pay for this.

728
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,884
One day, when we're alone--

729
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:48,479
No sensible man
would be alone with you.

730
00:42:48,556 --> 00:42:50,490
I could use a drink.

731
00:42:50,558 --> 00:42:51,991
So could I.

732
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:53,492
Just checking.

Everything all right?

Yep. Two corpses.
Everything's fine.

735
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,693
Anybody else want a whiskey?

736
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:02,633
Yeah.

737
00:43:04,138 --> 00:43:05,571
All right, look.

00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:07,038
Pay attention, everybody.

739
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:12,345
There's nobody else
in this house, correct?

740
00:43:12,413 --> 00:43:13,345
No.

741
00:43:13,414 --> 00:43:15,848
Then there is someone else here?

742
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:17,850
I said ''no'' meaning yes.

743

I want a straight answer.

744
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,686
Is there someone else,
yes or no?

Uh, no.

00:43:24,925 --> 00:43:26,756
No, there is, or isn't?

Yes.

Please!

749
00:43:30,164 --> 00:43:34,897
Shouldn't we get that man
out of the house?

750
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:37,904
How can we throw him out
in this weather?

751
00:43:37,972 --> 00:43:39,906
He may get suspicious.

752
00:43:39,974 --> 00:43:42,238
Throw him out,
he'll get more suspicious.

753
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:45,745
If I were him,
I'd be suspicious already.

754
00:43:45,813 --> 00:43:49,749
Let him stay locked up for
another half hour.

755
00:43:49,817 --> 00:43:52,752
The police will be here by then,

756
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,312
and there are two dead bodies
in the study!

- Shh!
- Shh!

758
00:43:57,792 --> 00:43:59,123
There's still some confusion

759
00:43:59,193 --> 00:44:01,127
about whether there's anybody else here.

760
00:44:01,195 --> 00:44:02,093
There isn't.

761
00:44:02,163 --> 00:44:03,596
Confusion or anybody else?

762
00:44:03,664 --> 00:44:04,596
Either.

763
00:44:04,665 --> 00:44:06,098
Give me a clear answer.

764
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:07,600
What was the question?

00:44:07,668 --> 00:44:09,932
Is anybody else in the house?

766
00:44:10,004 --> 00:44:11,028
- No!
- No!

767
00:44:11,105 --> 00:44:14,597
That's what he says,
but does he know?

768
00:44:14,675 --> 00:44:16,609
I suggest we handle this

769
00:44:16,677 --> 00:44:18,611
in proper military fashion.

770
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:21,477
We split up and
search the house.

771
00:44:21,549 --> 00:44:22,607
Split up?

772
00:44:22,683 --> 00:44:26,346
Yes. We have little time,
so we'll split up into pairs.

773
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,856
Pairs? Suppose one of us
is the murderer.

774
00:44:29,924 --> 00:44:33,416
Whoever's left with the killer
might get killed!

775
00:44:33,494 --> 00:44:35,428
Then we'll discover
the murderer.

776
00:44:35,496 --> 00:44:38,522
But the other half of the pair
would be dead!

777
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:40,066
Casualties are inevitable.

778
00:44:40,134 --> 00:44:42,068
You cannot make an omelet

Every cook will tell you that.

781
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,802
Look what happened to the cook.

782
00:44:48,876 --> 00:44:50,810
You're willing to chance that?

783
00:44:50,878 --> 00:44:52,539
What choice have we?

784
00:44:52,613 --> 00:44:53,841
None.

785
00:44:53,914 --> 00:44:55,711
I suppose you're right.

786
00:44:55,783 --> 00:44:57,216
It's dark upstairs.

787
00:44:57,284 --> 00:44:59,218
I'm frightened of the dark.

788
00:44:59,286 --> 00:45:01,220
Will anyone go with me?

789
00:45:01,288 --> 00:45:02,653
- I will.
- I will.

790
00:45:02,723 --> 00:45:04,156
No, thank you.

791
00:45:04,225 --> 00:45:08,127
I suggest we all draw lots
for partners.

The two shortest together,

793
00:45:31,585 --> 00:45:34,520
the next two shortest together.
Agreed?

794
00:45:34,588 --> 00:45:37,022
The two shortest search the cellar,

795
00:45:37,091 --> 00:45:38,991

845
00:52:26,233 --> 00:52:27,996
I'm in this big house,

846
00:52:28,068 --> 00:52:31,060
and I've been locked
into the lounge.

Yes.

848
00:52:33,907 --> 00:52:36,000
The funny thing is,

849
00:52:36,076 --> 00:52:38,271
there's a group of people here

850
00:52:38,345 --> 00:52:40,006
having some party,

851
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:44,016
and one of them is
my old boss from--

852

Looks like a secret passage.

Should we see where it leads?

854
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:39,504
What the hell.

855
00:53:39,573 --> 00:53:41,006
I'll go first.

Aah! Oh, God!

It's all right.

Oh, my God!

Get us out of here!

Where's it coming from?

Where are we going?

Where are they?

Where's the key?

The key's gone!

Unlock the door!

00:54:42,569 --> 00:54:46,005
I can't unlock the door
without the key!

They're shooting at us.

I've been shot.

Come out.
The door is open.

that thing at us?

You could've killed us.

I could've been killed!

I can't take any more scares.

But look!

Which one of you did it?

00:55:50,136 --> 00:55:52,070
We found him together.

How did you get in?

The door was locked.

From the cupboard?

It was locked!

It was unlocked.
See for yourself.

How did you know
it was unlocked?

903
00:56:14,594 --> 00:56:16,027
I didn't.

904

I found an abandoned car.

Did the driver
come here for help?

01:02:49,122 --> 01:02:50,714
Why did you lock him in again?

1018
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:54,719
We're still searching the house.

1019
01:02:54,794 --> 01:02:57,729
Only 1 5 minutes
before the police come.

1020
01:02:57,797 --> 01:02:59,230
The police already came!

1021
01:02:59,299 --> 01:03:01,233
Let's get on with it.

1022
01:03:01,301 --> 01:03:02,666
Monsieur.

1023
01:03:29,996 --> 01:03:31,588
Oh! Look.

1024
01:03:31,664 --> 01:03:33,757
I can't believe it.

1025
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:36,097
I wonder where
this one goes.

1026
01:03:36,169 --> 01:03:37,534
Let's find out.

1027
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:58,557
Let's try the ballroom again.

1028
01:04:24,817 --> 01:04:26,079
Aah!

1029
01:04:26,152 --> 01:04:27,813
Don't you touch me!

1030
01:04:33,092 --> 01:04:34,024
Aah!

1031
01:04:34,093 --> 01:04:35,060
Aah!

1032
01:04:35,128 --> 01:04:37,119
Aah!

1033
01:04:37,196 --> 01:04:40,029
Aah!

1034
01:04:42,201 --> 01:04:44,669
Hello? Hello?

1035
01:04:44,737 --> 01:04:46,261
[Whispering]
Shut the door.

1036
01:04:46,339 --> 01:04:48,273
Did anyone recognize you?

1037
01:04:48,341 --> 01:04:49,774
They must have,

1038
01:04:49,842 --> 01:04:52,276
and not just my face.

1039
01:04:52,345 --> 01:04:55,781
They know every inch of my body,

1040
01:04:55,848 --> 01:04:58,783
and they're not the only ones.

1041
01:04:58,851 --> 01:05:00,216
It's you!

1042
01:05:03,856 --> 01:05:06,222
Something funny's going on here.

1043
01:05:06,292 --> 01:05:08,624
I don't know what it is.

1044
01:05:11,497 --> 01:05:13,727
No, I'm not on duty,

1045
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:17,531
but I have a feeling
that I'm in danger.

1046
01:05:17,603 --> 01:05:20,436
You know that big ugly house--

1047
01:05:20,506 --> 01:05:22,599
Hello?

1048
01:05:22,675 --> 01:05:23,767
Hello?

1049
01:05:26,179 --> 01:05:27,578
Are you there?

1050
01:05:49,669 --> 01:05:50,863
Aah!

1051
01:05:50,937 --> 01:05:52,768
I'm coming!

1052
01:05:52,839 --> 01:05:54,932
I'm trying to find the door.

1053
01:05:55,007 --> 01:05:56,406
Help me!

1054
01:05:56,476 --> 01:05:58,171
Coming!

1055
01:05:58,244 --> 01:05:59,575
What's this?

1056
01:05:59,645 --> 01:06:01,374
Another door?

1057
01:07:12,185 --> 01:07:13,550
Two murders.

1058
01:07:21,194 --> 01:07:23,128
Neither of them shot.

1059
01:07:23,196 --> 01:07:24,629
I heard a gun.

1060
01:07:24,697 --> 01:07:26,130
So did I.

1061
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:28,633
I heard the front door slam.

1062
01:07:28,701 --> 01:07:30,464
The murderer must've run out.

1063
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:37,540
Three murders?

1064
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:39,578
Six all together.

1065
01:07:39,645 --> 01:07:41,704
This is getting serious.

1066
01:07:51,224 --> 01:07:54,682
No gun.
Yvette dropped it here.

1067
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:58,196
Very well, I know who did it.

1068
01:07:58,264 --> 01:07:59,663
You do?

1069
01:07:59,732 --> 01:08:02,599
Furthermore,
I'll tell you how it was done.

1070
01:08:02,668 --> 01:08:03,965
Follow me.

1071
01:08:07,907 --> 01:08:11,104
I shall take you through
the events of the evening

1072
01:08:11,177 --> 01:08:12,610
step-by-step.

1073
01:08:12,678 --> 01:08:15,112
At the start of the evening,

1074
01:08:15,181 --> 01:08:17,115
Yvette was here by herself,

1075
01:08:17,183 --> 01:08:20,619
waiting to offer you
a glass of champagne.

1076
01:08:20,686 --> 01:08:23,120
I was in the hall.

1077
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:26,124
I know because I was there.

1078
01:08:26,192 --> 01:08:29,491
Then I hurried across
to the kitchen.

1079
01:08:32,064 --> 01:08:34,624
The cook was in here alive,

1080
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,133
sharpening knives.

1081
01:08:36,202 --> 01:08:37,533
And then...

1082
01:08:39,038 --> 01:08:40,562
the doorbell rang.

1083
01:08:42,008 --> 01:08:44,238
And it was you.

1084
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:47,143
I recognized you as Colonel Mustard.

1085
01:08:47,213 --> 01:08:49,647
I prevented you
from telling your name.

1086
01:08:49,715 --> 01:08:52,149
I wanted you to use your pseudonym.

1087
01:08:52,218 --> 01:08:55,278
I ran across to the library.

1088
01:08:55,354 --> 01:08:57,151
Yvette met you and smiled

1089
01:08:57,223 --> 01:08:59,418
and poured you a drink.

1090
01:09:02,061 --> 01:09:03,426
The doorbell rang.

1091
01:09:03,496 --> 01:09:06,363
It was Mrs. White
looking pale and tragic.

1092
01:09:06,432 --> 01:09:08,093
And I took her coat and hung it up.

1093
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:10,601
I introduced Mrs. White
to Colonel Mustard.

1094
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:12,103
Hello. Hello.

1095
01:09:12,171 --> 01:09:15,265
I noticed that Mrs. White
and Yvette flinched.

1096
01:09:15,341 --> 01:09:17,605
There was thunder and lightning.

1097
01:09:17,677 --> 01:09:20,441
To make a long story short--

1098
01:09:20,513 --> 01:09:21,810
Too late!

1099
01:09:21,881 --> 01:09:23,644
you all arrived.

1100
01:09:23,716 --> 01:09:25,616
The gong struck the cook.

1101
01:09:25,685 --> 01:09:28,279
We went into the dining room.

1102
01:09:28,354 --> 01:09:30,117
Mrs. Peacock sat here.

1103
01:09:30,189 --> 01:09:31,622
Professor Plum sat here.

1104
01:09:31,691 --> 01:09:33,124
Mrs. White sat here.

1105
01:09:33,192 --> 01:09:35,786
Mr. Green, Miss Scarlet,
Colonel Mustard.

1106
01:09:35,861 --> 01:09:37,556
This chair was vacant.

1107
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:41,396
We all revealed
we'd received a letter.

1108
01:09:41,467 --> 01:09:42,900
Get on with it!

1109
01:09:42,968 --> 01:09:44,629
The point is... blackmail!

1110
01:09:44,704 --> 01:09:47,969
This came out
after dinner in the study.

1111
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,234
You're right!

1112
01:09:51,844 --> 01:09:53,641
Mr. Green stood here.

1113
01:09:53,713 --> 01:09:55,146
Mrs. Peacock here.

1114
01:09:55,214 --> 01:09:56,647
Miss Scarlet here.

1115
01:09:56,716 --> 01:09:58,149
Professor Plum here.

1116
01:09:58,217 --> 01:10:00,151
Colonel Mustard and Mrs. White.

1117
01:10:00,219 --> 01:10:01,652
Get on with it!

1118
01:10:01,721 --> 01:10:04,554
Mr. Boddy went to get
the surprise packages.

1119
01:10:04,623 --> 01:10:06,090
You opened your presents.

1120
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:08,319
Mr. Boddy switched off the lights.

1121
01:10:08,394 --> 01:10:11,261
- Aah! Aah!
- Aah!

1122
01:10:13,899 --> 01:10:15,332
Oh, grand.

1123
01:10:15,401 --> 01:10:18,393
Mr. Boddy lay on the floor
apparently dead.

1124
01:10:18,471 --> 01:10:20,336
He was dead!

1125
01:10:20,406 --> 01:10:23,967
He was bashed later on the head.

1126
01:10:24,043 --> 01:10:25,533
Okay, I made a mistake.

1127
01:10:25,611 --> 01:10:28,876
Why was Mr. Boddy
pretending to be dead?

1128
01:10:28,948 --> 01:10:31,849
He realized his scheme had misfired,

1129
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:34,852
and the gunshot was intended for him.

1130
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,855
Look. The bullet grazed his ear.

1131
01:10:37,923 --> 01:10:40,357
To escape death,
he pretended to be dead.

1132
01:10:40,426 --> 01:10:43,395
The gunman tried to kill him.

1133
01:10:43,462 --> 01:10:45,362
But remember what happened next.

1134
01:10:45,431 --> 01:10:47,865
Mrs. Peacock took a drink.

1135
01:10:47,933 --> 01:10:49,867
You said, ''Maybe it's poisoned.''

1136
01:10:49,935 --> 01:10:51,368
She screams. Aah!

1137
01:10:51,437 --> 01:10:54,372
We took her to the sofa.

1138
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,930
Mr. Green...

1139
01:10:56,008 --> 01:10:59,876
Well, I had to stop her screaming.

1140
01:10:59,945 --> 01:11:01,378
Then, more screaming.

1141
01:11:01,447 --> 01:11:02,812
Yvette!
The billiard room!

1142
01:11:02,882 --> 01:11:04,213
We all rushed out.

1143
01:11:06,519 --> 01:11:08,919
One of us wasn't here. No.

1144
01:11:08,988 --> 01:11:09,955
- No?
- No?

1145
01:11:10,022 --> 01:11:12,820
Maybe one of us
was murdering the cook.

1146
01:11:12,892 --> 01:11:14,416
Who wasn't here with us?

1147
01:11:14,493 --> 01:11:16,586
Do you know?

1148
01:11:16,662 --> 01:11:17,924
I do.

1149
01:11:17,997 --> 01:11:19,191
While we stood here,

1150
01:11:19,265 --> 01:11:21,597
trying to stop Yvette from panicking,

1151
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:23,635
someone could've stayed in here,

1152
01:11:23,702 --> 01:11:24,964
picked up the dagger,

1153
01:11:25,037 --> 01:11:27,801
run down the hall,

1154
01:11:27,873 --> 01:11:29,431
and stabbed the cook!

1155
01:11:29,508 --> 01:11:32,409
We might've seen
him running back.

1156
01:11:32,478 --> 01:11:35,242
Not if they used this secret passage.

1157
01:11:35,314 --> 01:11:38,545
He ran down this to the study.

1158
01:11:38,617 --> 01:11:40,380
That's where it comes out?

1159
01:11:40,453 --> 01:11:41,385
Yes!

1160
01:11:43,389 --> 01:11:44,378
What?

1161
01:11:44,457 --> 01:11:45,822
How did you know?

1162
01:11:45,891 --> 01:11:47,916
I've known all along.

1163
01:11:47,993 --> 01:11:49,984
You could be the murderer.

1164
01:11:50,062 --> 01:11:53,293
Ridiculous. If I was,
would I reveal how I did it?

1165
01:11:53,365 --> 01:11:56,892
Well, who else knew
about the secret passage?

1166
01:11:56,969 --> 01:11:58,903
We found it, Mustard and me.

1167
01:11:58,971 --> 01:12:00,734
You found it.
You could've known.

1168
01:12:00,806 --> 01:12:01,830
I didn't.

1169
01:12:01,907 --> 01:12:03,340
Why should we believe you?

1170
01:12:03,409 --> 01:12:07,436
Because she was with us
in the billiard room.

1171
01:12:07,513 --> 01:12:09,310
Why was the cook murdered?

1172
01:12:09,381 --> 01:12:12,009
She had nothing to do with Mr. Boddy.

1173
01:12:12,084 --> 01:12:13,608
Of course she did.

1174
01:12:13,686 --> 01:12:15,119
I gathered you here

1175
01:12:15,187 --> 01:12:18,623
because you were all implicated
in Mr. Boddy's blackmail.

1176
01:12:18,691 --> 01:12:21,819
Didn't anyone deduce
the others were involved, too?

1177
01:12:23,062 --> 01:12:24,188
What others?

1178
01:12:24,263 --> 01:12:25,696
The cook and Yvette.

1179
01:12:25,764 --> 01:12:26,696
No.

1180
01:12:26,765 --> 01:12:29,199
That's how he got
his information.

1181
01:12:29,268 --> 01:12:30,530
Before blackmailing anyone,

1182
01:12:30,603 --> 01:12:33,367
Mr. Boddy had to discover
their guilty secret.

1183
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:35,669
The cook and Yvette
were his accomplices.

1184
01:12:35,741 --> 01:12:37,003
I see.

1185
01:12:37,076 --> 01:12:39,476
So whoever knew...

1186
01:12:39,545 --> 01:12:42,605
that the cook was involved...
killed her?

1187
01:12:42,681 --> 01:12:43,909
Yes.

1188
01:12:43,983 --> 01:12:47,043
I know, because I was
Mr. Boddy's butler,

1189
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:50,020
that the cook had worked
for one of you.

1190
01:12:50,089 --> 01:12:51,181
Who?

1191
01:12:51,257 --> 01:12:52,519
You recognized Yvette.

1192
01:12:52,591 --> 01:12:53,888
Don't deny it.

1193
01:12:53,959 --> 01:12:55,392
What do you mean?

1194
01:12:55,461 --> 01:12:56,894
I'm not denying anything.

1195
01:12:56,962 --> 01:12:58,224
Another denial.

1196
01:12:58,297 --> 01:12:59,730
Okay, I knew Yvette.

1197
01:12:59,798 --> 01:13:02,733
My husband had an affair with her,

1198
01:13:02,801 --> 01:13:04,735
but I didn't care.

1199
01:13:04,803 --> 01:13:06,236
You knew Yvette, too.

1200
01:13:06,305 --> 01:13:07,567
She worked for me.

1201
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:08,902
You, also, sir.

1202
01:13:08,974 --> 01:13:10,305
We've already established

1203
01:13:10,376 --> 01:13:12,810
that you were one
of Miss Scarlet's clients.

1204
01:13:12,878 --> 01:13:15,142
That's why you wanted
those negatives--

1205
01:13:15,214 --> 01:13:18,877
photographs of you and Yvette
in flagrante delicto.

1206
01:13:18,951 --> 01:13:22,478
Boddy threatened to send them
to my mother,

1207
01:13:22,555 --> 01:13:23,988
which would've killed her.

1208
01:13:24,056 --> 01:13:25,489
That would've been an achievement,

1209
01:13:25,558 --> 01:13:27,321
since you said she's dead already.

1210
01:13:27,393 --> 01:13:29,224
So, he had the motive.

1211
01:13:29,295 --> 01:13:30,819
You all did.

1212
01:13:30,896 --> 01:13:32,955
Where was Mr. Boddy killed?

1213
01:13:33,032 --> 01:13:35,432
Don't you see? Look.

1214
01:13:35,501 --> 01:13:37,059
We returned to the study.

1215
01:13:37,136 --> 01:13:39,570
Mr. Boddy was pretending to be dead,

1216
01:13:39,638 --> 01:13:41,401
but someone knows he's alive.

1217
01:13:41,473 --> 01:13:44,408
I explained
that I'd invited you here.

1218
01:13:44,476 --> 01:13:47,741
We realized only
one other person was here.

1219
01:13:47,813 --> 01:13:49,178
The cook!

1220
01:13:56,422 --> 01:13:59,186
Well, where is he?

1221
01:13:59,258 --> 01:14:01,419
Aah!

1222
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:06,693
By now she was dead.

1223
01:14:06,765 --> 01:14:08,198
We laid her down.

1224
01:14:08,267 --> 01:14:11,031
Someone slipped through
the same secret passage.

1225
01:14:11,103 --> 01:14:12,195
Again?

1226
01:14:12,271 --> 01:14:14,762
Of course.
Back to the study.

1227
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,899
The murderer was in
the secret passage.

1228
01:14:16,976 --> 01:14:19,740
Meanwhile, Mr. Boddy
had been on the floor.

1229
01:14:19,812 --> 01:14:21,245
He jumped up.

1230
01:14:21,313 --> 01:14:24,248
The murderer came out of here,

1231
01:14:24,316 --> 01:14:26,477
picked up the candlestick.

1232
01:14:26,552 --> 01:14:28,611
Mr. Boddy followed us into here,

1233
01:14:28,687 --> 01:14:30,621
looking for an escape.

1234
01:14:30,689 --> 01:14:31,951
The murderer crept up...

1235
01:14:32,024 --> 01:14:33,457
and killed him!

1236
01:14:33,525 --> 01:14:35,459
Will you stop that?

1237
01:14:35,527 --> 01:14:37,188
No.

1238
01:14:37,262 --> 01:14:40,129
Then he threw him into the toilet

1239
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:42,463
and rejoined us in the kitchen.

1240
01:14:42,534 --> 01:14:45,799
Who wasn't in the kitchen
the entire time?

1241
01:14:45,871 --> 01:14:48,305
Whoever it was is the murderer.

1242
01:14:48,374 --> 01:14:49,739
[Toilet Flushing]

1243
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:53,241
We locked the weapons up

1244
01:14:53,312 --> 01:14:55,576
and ran to the front door...

1245
01:14:55,648 --> 01:14:58,173
to throw away the key.

1246
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:00,514
The motorist!
I didn't throw it.

1247
01:15:00,586 --> 01:15:02,952
I put it in my pocket.

1248
01:15:03,022 --> 01:15:04,284
Someone could've removed it

1249
01:15:04,356 --> 01:15:05,618
and substituted another.

1250
01:15:05,691 --> 01:15:07,955
We were all in a huddle.

1251
01:15:08,027 --> 01:15:09,289
Anyone could've done that.

1252
01:15:09,361 --> 01:15:10,760
Wait a minute.

1253
01:15:12,164 --> 01:15:15,463
Colonel Mustard
has a top-secret Pentagon job.

1254
01:15:15,534 --> 01:15:18,901
Mrs. White's husband was
a nuclear physicist, and...

1255
01:15:20,372 --> 01:15:23,864
Yvette is a link between them.

1256
01:15:23,942 --> 01:15:25,910
What's your top-secret job?

1257
01:15:25,978 --> 01:15:27,912
He's working on the secret

1258
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:30,642
of the next fusion bomb.

1259
01:15:30,716 --> 01:15:32,013
How did you know?

1260
01:15:32,084 --> 01:15:34,985
Can you keep a secret?
So can I.

1261
01:15:35,054 --> 01:15:38,546
Is this a plot,
or did Mustard do it alone?

1262
01:15:38,624 --> 01:15:39,989
We shall see.

1263
01:15:40,059 --> 01:15:43,324
Bad luck that motorist
arrived at that moment.

1264
01:15:43,395 --> 01:15:45,488
Not luck. I invited him.

1265
01:15:45,564 --> 01:15:46,758
You did?

1266
01:15:46,832 --> 01:15:49,596
Everyone here was
Mr. Boddy's victim or accomplice.

1267
01:15:49,668 --> 01:15:53,934
Everyone who's died gave him
information about one of you.

1268
01:15:54,006 --> 01:15:55,439
I got them here

1269
01:15:55,507 --> 01:15:58,203
so they'd give evidence
against him.

1270
01:15:58,277 --> 01:15:59,801
What about that motorist?

1271
01:15:59,878 --> 01:16:01,641
What information did he have?

1272
01:16:01,714 --> 01:16:04,615
He was my driver during the war.

1273
01:16:04,683 --> 01:16:07,117
What was he holding over you?

1274
01:16:07,186 --> 01:16:10,622
He knew that I was a war profiteer.

1275
01:16:10,689 --> 01:16:13,954
I stole essential
air force radio parts,

1276
01:16:14,026 --> 01:16:17,291
and I sold them
on the black market.

1277
01:16:17,362 --> 01:16:19,626
That's how I made all my money.

1278
01:16:19,698 --> 01:16:22,223
But that doesn't make me a murderer.

1279
01:16:22,301 --> 01:16:24,326
A lot of our airmen died

1280
01:16:24,403 --> 01:16:26,564
because their radios didn't work.

1281
01:16:26,638 --> 01:16:29,539
Was the policeman working
for Mr. Boddy, too?

1282
01:16:29,608 --> 01:16:31,371
The cop was from Washington.

1283
01:16:31,443 --> 01:16:33,206
He was on my payroll.

1284
01:16:33,278 --> 01:16:36,543
I bribed him
so I could carry on with business.

1285
01:16:36,615 --> 01:16:37,877
Mr. Boddy found out.

1286
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:39,383
Oh, my God!

1287
01:16:39,451 --> 01:16:42,284
Oh, please.

1288
01:16:42,354 --> 01:16:44,481
And the singing telegram girl?

1289
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:50,494
She was my patient once.

1290
01:16:50,562 --> 01:16:53,190
I had an affair with her.

1291
01:16:53,265 --> 01:16:55,665
That's how I lost my license.

1292
01:16:55,734 --> 01:16:57,998
Mr. Boddy found that out, too.

1293
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:01,335
Well, let's put her in the study.

1294
01:17:03,342 --> 01:17:04,331
So...

1295
01:17:04,409 --> 01:17:06,809
now you all know why they died.

1296
01:17:06,879 --> 01:17:08,403
Whoever killed Mr. Boddy

1297
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,243
also wanted his accomplices dead.

1298
01:17:10,315 --> 01:17:12,806
How did the murderer
know about them?

1299
01:17:12,885 --> 01:17:17,447
I'd guessed that this young singer
told Boddy about me.

1300
01:17:17,523 --> 01:17:20,458
I knew nothing about any of you.

1301
01:17:20,526 --> 01:17:23,461
The murderer needed
to get the weapons.

1302
01:17:23,529 --> 01:17:24,962
He stole the key.

1303
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:26,588
We followed Mustard's suggestion

1304
01:17:26,665 --> 01:17:29,634
to split up and
search the house.

1305
01:17:29,701 --> 01:17:31,066
That's right.

1306
01:17:31,136 --> 01:17:32,899
It was Colonel Mustard's suggestion.

1307
01:17:32,971 --> 01:17:35,098
Someone got away from his partner

1308
01:17:35,174 --> 01:17:37,039
and hurried to the study.

1309
01:17:37,109 --> 01:17:39,373
On the desk was Mr. Boddy's envelope.

1310
01:17:39,444 --> 01:17:41,207
It contained photographs and letters--

1311
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,214
the evidence of Mr. Boddy's informants.

1312
01:17:43,282 --> 01:17:45,216
Where is the envelope now?

1313
01:17:45,284 --> 01:17:46,308
Gone.

1314
01:17:47,553 --> 01:17:48,850

1315
01:17:48,921 --> 01:17:50,354

01:17:50,422 --> 01:17:52,754

1317
01:17:55,227 --> 01:17:56,387

Having found out the whole story,

1319
01:17:58,964 --> 01:18:01,228
the murderer went to the cupboard,

1320
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,131
took out the wrench...

1321
01:18:03,202 --> 01:18:06,535
then we found the secret passage
to the lounge,

1322
01:18:06,605 --> 01:18:08,368
where we found
the motorist dead.

1323
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,374
And we couldn't get in.

1324
01:18:10,442 --> 01:18:12,376
Yvette ran to the cupboard,

1325
01:18:12,444 --> 01:18:15,709
got the gun,
and shot the door open.

1326
01:18:15,781 --> 01:18:17,715
Then the doorbell rang.

We locked him up.

We forgot the cupboard was unlocked.

1348
01:18:58,290 --> 01:18:59,279
Turn on the lights!

1349
01:18:59,925 --> 01:19:02,257
Sorry.
Didn't mean to frighten you.

1350
01:19:02,327 --> 01:19:03,624
You're a bit late!

1351
01:19:03,695 --> 01:19:06,129
I hate when he does that.

1352
01:19:06,198 --> 01:19:08,189
Then there were
three more murders.

1353
01:19:08,267 --> 01:19:09,427
Who did it?

1354
01:19:09,501 --> 01:19:11,435
None of us killed
Mr. Boddy or the cook.

1355
01:19:11,503 --> 01:19:12,561
Who did?

1356
01:19:12,638 --> 01:19:15,106
The person who wasn't with us.

1357
01:19:16,842 --> 01:19:17,774
Yvette.

1358
01:19:17,843 --> 01:19:19,310
- Yvette?
- Yvette?

1359
01:19:19,378 --> 01:19:22,176
She was listening
to our conversation.

1360
01:19:22,247 --> 01:19:24,272
She thought he was dead.

1361
01:19:24,349 --> 01:19:26,010
While we examined
the bullet hole,

1362
01:19:26,084 --> 01:19:27,449
she got the dagger,

1363
01:19:27,519 --> 01:19:29,111
ran to the kitchen,

1364
01:19:29,187 --> 01:19:30,449
and stabbed the cook.

1365
01:19:30,522 --> 01:19:31,887
We didn't hear her scream

1366
01:19:31,957 --> 01:19:34,892
because Mrs. Peacock was screaming.

1367
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,396
Yvette screamed,
and we ran to her.

1368
01:19:38,463 --> 01:19:40,021
When did she kill Mr. Boddy?

1369
01:19:40,098 --> 01:19:41,360
When I said.

1370
01:19:41,433 --> 01:19:43,367
We ran to the kitchen.

1371
01:19:43,435 --> 01:19:45,869
Yvette hid to check Mr. Boddy.

1372
01:19:45,938 --> 01:19:48,338
He got up and followed them.

1373
01:19:48,407 --> 01:19:50,841
She hit him on the head

1374
01:19:50,909 --> 01:19:52,536
and dragged him to the toilet.

1375
01:19:52,611 --> 01:19:53,600
Why?

1376
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:54,941
To create confusion.

1377
01:19:55,013 --> 01:19:56,913
It worked.

1378
01:19:56,982 --> 01:19:58,813
Why did she do it?

1379
01:19:58,884 --> 01:20:00,317
She was acting under orders

1380
01:20:00,385 --> 01:20:02,819
from the person
who later killed her.

1381
01:20:02,888 --> 01:20:03,855
- Who?
- Who?

1382
01:20:03,922 --> 01:20:04,911
Who?

1383
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:07,982
Was it one of her clients?

1384
01:20:09,428 --> 01:20:11,862
Or was it a jealous wife?

1385
01:20:11,930 --> 01:20:13,864
Or an adulterous doctor?

1386
01:20:13,932 --> 01:20:15,900
No.

1387
01:20:15,968 --> 01:20:18,402
It was her employer, Miss Scarlet.

1388
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:19,732
That's a lie!

1389
01:20:19,805 --> 01:20:21,238
Is it?

1390
01:20:21,306 --> 01:20:22,739
You used her.

1391
01:20:22,808 --> 01:20:24,241
You killed the motorist

1392
01:20:24,309 --> 01:20:26,743
when we split up
to search the house.

1393
01:20:26,812 --> 01:20:29,576
How could I have known
about the passage?

1394
01:20:29,648 --> 01:20:30,910
Easy. Yvette told you.

1395
01:20:30,983 --> 01:20:32,712
When we split up again,

1396
01:20:32,784 --> 01:20:34,581
you switched off the electricity.

1397
01:20:34,653 --> 01:20:38,419
It was easy for you
on the ground floor.

1398
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:40,924
You got the rope,
strangled Yvette,

1399
01:20:40,993 --> 01:20:42,187
ran to the library,

1400
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,454
killed the cop,

1401
01:20:43,528 --> 01:20:46,326
picked up the gun
where Yvette dropped it,

1402
01:20:46,398 --> 01:20:47,990
opened the front door,

1403
01:20:48,066 --> 01:20:50,864
recognized the singing telegram
from her photograph,

1404
01:20:50,936 --> 01:20:52,733
and shot her.

1405
01:20:52,804 --> 01:20:54,294
You've no proof.

1406
01:20:54,373 --> 01:20:55,772
The gun is missing.

1407
01:20:55,841 --> 01:20:57,775
Gentlemen, turn out your pockets.

1408
01:20:57,843 --> 01:20:59,640
Ladies, empty your purses.

1409
01:20:59,711 --> 01:21:04,011
Whoever has the gun
is the murderer.

1410
01:21:04,082 --> 01:21:05,709
Brilliantly worked out, Wadsworth.

1411
01:21:05,784 --> 01:21:07,046
I congratulate you.

1412
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:08,416
Me, too.

1413
01:21:08,487 --> 01:21:09,749
Shut up!

1414
01:21:09,821 --> 01:21:11,686
I don't understand one thing.

1415
01:21:11,757 --> 01:21:13,019
One thing?

1416
01:21:13,091 --> 01:21:14,854
Why did you do it?

1417
01:21:14,926 --> 01:21:17,690
Half of Washington
knows what you do.

1418
01:21:17,763 --> 01:21:20,960
You were in no real danger.

1419
01:21:21,033 --> 01:21:23,467
They don't know my real business.

1420
01:21:23,535 --> 01:21:25,469
My business is secrets.

1421
01:21:25,537 --> 01:21:28,472
Yvette found them out for me.

1422
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:31,475
The secrets of Senator Peacock's
defense committee,

1423
01:21:31,543 --> 01:21:34,842
of Colonel Mustard's fusion bomb,

1424
01:21:34,913 --> 01:21:37,313
Professor Plum's U.N. contacts,

1425
01:21:37,382 --> 01:21:40,545
and the work of your husband,

1426
01:21:40,619 --> 01:21:44,055
the nuclear physicist.

1427
01:21:44,122 --> 01:21:45,919
So, it is political.

1428
01:21:45,991 --> 01:21:47,356
You're a communist!

1429
01:21:47,426 --> 01:21:50,361
No, communism is
just a red herring.

1430
01:21:50,429 --> 01:21:53,193
Like all members of
the oldest profession,

1431
01:21:53,265 --> 01:21:54,562
I'm a capitalist,

1432
01:21:54,633 --> 01:21:56,760
and I'll sell my secrets--

1433
01:21:56,835 --> 01:21:58,268
your secrets--

1434
01:21:58,336 --> 01:22:00,031
to the highest bidder.

1435
01:22:00,105 --> 01:22:02,335
What if we don't cooperate?

1436
01:22:02,407 --> 01:22:05,137
You will, or I'll expose you.

1437
01:22:05,210 --> 01:22:07,178
We'll expose you. Six murders?

1438
01:22:07,245 --> 01:22:10,544
It won't enhance
your reputation at the U.N.

1439
01:22:10,615 --> 01:22:12,879
if it's revealed
you've been implicated

1440
01:22:12,951 --> 01:22:14,885
in adultery with a patient

1441
01:22:14,953 --> 01:22:18,548
and her death
and the deaths of five others.

1442
01:22:18,623 --> 01:22:21,524
I might go up in their estimation.

1443
01:22:21,593 --> 01:22:23,356
And it's no good...

1444
01:22:23,428 --> 01:22:24,861
blackmailing me, madam.

1445
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:26,192
I have no money.

1446
01:22:26,264 --> 01:22:27,526
Neither do I.

1447
01:22:27,599 --> 01:22:29,032
I know, sweetie pie.

1448
01:22:29,101 --> 01:22:31,865
You can pay me
in government information.

1449
01:22:31,937 --> 01:22:33,302
All of you.

1450
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:35,872
Except you, Wadsworth.

1451
01:22:35,941 --> 01:22:37,704
You as a mere butler

1452
01:22:37,776 --> 01:22:40,677
have no access
to government secrets.

1453
01:22:40,745 --> 01:22:43,680
So, I'm afraid
your moment has come.

1454
01:22:43,748 --> 01:22:45,181
Not so fast.

1455
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:48,185
I do have a secret or two.

1456
01:22:48,253 --> 01:22:49,515
Such as?

1457
01:22:49,588 --> 01:22:50,850
The game's up.

1458
01:22:50,922 --> 01:22:52,685
There are no more bullets.

1459
01:22:52,757 --> 01:22:54,520
I won't fall for that.

1460
01:22:54,593 --> 01:22:55,855
One shot at Boddy,

1461
01:22:55,927 --> 01:22:57,360
two for the chandelier,

1462
01:22:57,429 --> 01:22:58,862
two at the lounge door,

1463
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:00,864
and one for the singing telegram.

1464
01:23:00,932 --> 01:23:02,365
That's not six.

1465
01:23:02,434 --> 01:23:03,492
Count.

1466
01:23:03,568 --> 01:23:05,331
One shot at the chandelier.

1467
01:23:05,403 --> 01:23:08,668
That's 1 plus <i>2</i> plus 1 plus 1 .

1468
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:12,176
No, 1 plus 1 plus <i>2</i> plus 1 .

1469
01:23:12,244 --> 01:23:15,509
Okay, 1 plus <i>2</i> plus 1 ...
Shut up!

1470
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:17,013
There's one bullet left.

1471
01:23:17,082 --> 01:23:19,277
Guess who's getting it?

1472
01:23:19,351 --> 01:23:20,409
[Ringing]

1473
01:23:20,485 --> 01:23:22,851
Ohh! Aah!

1474
01:23:30,362 --> 01:23:31,920
I'm only a guest.

1475
01:23:35,066 --> 01:23:36,499
Where's the chief?

1476
01:23:37,869 --> 01:23:39,928
Ah, Wadsworth, well done.

1477
01:23:40,005 --> 01:23:42,439
I did warn you, my dear.

1478
01:23:42,507 --> 01:23:45,442
Mr. Hoover is an expert on Armageddon.

1479
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:48,946
Don't hate me for trying
to shoot you.

1480
01:23:49,014 --> 01:23:51,778
Frankly, Scarlet,
I don't give a damn.

1481
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:54,011
There are no bullets left.

1482
01:23:58,190 --> 01:23:59,953
1 plus <i>2</i>...

1483
01:24:00,025 --> 01:24:01,458
plus 1 ...

1484
01:24:01,526 --> 01:24:02,993
plus <i>2</i>...

1485
01:24:03,061 --> 01:24:05,291
plus 1 is...

1486
01:24:20,245 --> 01:24:22,475
The murderer ran to the study,

1487
01:24:22,547 --> 01:24:25,482
picked up the rope
and lead pipe,

1488
01:24:25,550 --> 01:24:27,313
ran to the billiard room,

1489
01:24:27,385 --> 01:24:28,818
strangled Yvette.

1490
01:24:28,887 --> 01:24:30,149
Ran to the library,

1491
01:24:30,222 --> 01:24:33,385
hit the cop
with the lead pipe.

1492
01:24:33,458 --> 01:24:35,926
The singing telegram's
at the door.

1493
01:24:35,994 --> 01:24:38,121
The murderer got the gun,

1494
01:24:38,196 --> 01:24:39,629
opened the door,

1495
01:24:39,698 --> 01:24:41,461
recognized the girl,
shot her,

1496
01:24:41,533 --> 01:24:44,434
and ran back to the cellar.

1497
01:24:44,502 --> 01:24:47,437
But Colonel Mustard
wasn't in the cellar.

1498
01:24:47,505 --> 01:24:50,167
No...but you were.

1499
01:24:51,943 --> 01:24:53,001
So?

1500
01:24:53,078 --> 01:24:54,545
You murdered them all.

1501
01:24:54,613 --> 01:24:57,377
You were missing
during the murders,

1502
01:24:57,449 --> 01:24:59,440
and the cook was once yours.

1503
01:24:59,517 --> 01:25:02,748
Don't you remember
your fatal mistake?

1504
01:25:02,821 --> 01:25:04,311
You told us at dinner

1505
01:25:04,389 --> 01:25:07,950
we were eating
one of your favorite recipes,

1506
01:25:08,026 --> 01:25:10,460
and monkey's brains,
though popular in Cantonese cuisine,

1507
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,758
are not often found
in Washington, D.C.

1508
01:25:12,831 --> 01:25:15,299
Is that what we ate?

1509
01:25:15,367 --> 01:25:17,460
Why would I murder the others?

1510
01:25:17,535 --> 01:25:19,901
In case they knew your secret.

1511
01:25:19,971 --> 01:25:22,201
So this had nothing to do

1512
01:25:22,274 --> 01:25:24,640
with the disappearing
nuclear physicist.

1513
01:25:24,709 --> 01:25:26,734
Communism was just a red herring.

1514
01:25:26,811 --> 01:25:29,712
Mrs. Peacock did it all.

1515
01:25:29,781 --> 01:25:31,112
There's no proof.

1516
01:25:31,182 --> 01:25:33,150
Well, the gun is missing.

1517
01:25:33,218 --> 01:25:35,186
Gentlemen, turn out your pockets.

1518
01:25:35,253 --> 01:25:37,016
Ladies, empty your purses.

1519
01:25:37,088 --> 01:25:39,386
Whoever has the gun...

1520
01:25:39,457 --> 01:25:41,391
is the murderer.

1521
01:25:41,459 --> 01:25:43,324
Very well.

1522
01:25:43,395 --> 01:25:46,364
What do you propose
to do about it?

1523
01:25:46,431 --> 01:25:48,365
Nothing.

1524
01:25:48,433 --> 01:25:49,866
Nothing?

1525
01:25:49,934 --> 01:25:52,198
I don't approve of murder,

1526
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:54,534
but you've done a public service

1527
01:25:54,606 --> 01:25:57,837
by ridding it
of a blackmailer and his informers.

1528
01:25:57,909 --> 01:26:00,207
What happens when the police arrive?

1529
01:26:00,278 --> 01:26:01,711
Why should the police come?

1530
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:03,042
Nobody's called them.

1531
01:26:03,114 --> 01:26:05,048
You mean...

1532
01:26:05,116 --> 01:26:06,276
That's right.

1533
01:26:06,351 --> 01:26:10,287
I suggest we stack
the bodies in the cellar,

1534
01:26:10,355 --> 01:26:13,290
lock it,
leave quietly one at a time,

1535
01:26:13,358 --> 01:26:15,792
and pretend this never happened.

1536
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:17,828
Great idea.

1537
01:26:17,896 --> 01:26:20,831
I'll leave first...
if you don't mind.

1538
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:23,633
Be my guest.

1539
01:26:23,702 --> 01:26:24,634
In fact,

1540
01:26:24,703 --> 01:26:27,570
we owe you a vote of thanks.

1541
01:26:50,929 --> 01:26:53,523
I told you I didn't do it.

1542
01:26:53,598 --> 01:26:55,862
What if the authorities find out?

1543
01:26:55,934 --> 01:26:57,993
The F.B.I. will handle that.

1544
01:26:58,069 --> 01:26:59,730
My call from Mr. Hoover.

1545
01:26:59,804 --> 01:27:01,237
I work for him.

1546
01:27:01,306 --> 01:27:03,501
That's how I know about you.

1547
01:27:03,575 --> 01:27:06,009
There's one thing
I don't understand.

1548
01:27:06,077 --> 01:27:07,339
One thing?

1549
01:27:07,412 --> 01:27:10,176
Who was Mrs. Peacock
taking bribes from?

1550
01:27:10,248 --> 01:27:11,510
A foreign power.

1551
01:27:11,583 --> 01:27:13,710
Her husband controls
defense contracts.

1552
01:27:13,785 --> 01:27:14,945
There'll be a cover-up?

1553
01:27:15,019 --> 01:27:18,386
What could be gained by exposure?

1554
01:27:18,456 --> 01:27:21,357
Does the F.B.I. clean up
after multiple murder?

1555
01:27:21,426 --> 01:27:25,624
Yes. That's why it's run
by a man called Hoover.

1556
01:27:30,201 --> 01:27:31,668
Oh, Mrs. Peacock.

1557
01:27:34,205 --> 01:27:36,765
How did you know my name?

1558
01:27:36,841 --> 01:27:39,571
The kingdom of heaven is at hand.

1559
01:27:40,879 --> 01:27:42,744
Okay, take her away.

1560
01:27:44,916 --> 01:27:46,850
Take your hands off me!

1561
01:27:46,918 --> 01:27:48,783
I'm a senator's wife!

1562
01:27:50,221 --> 01:27:52,883
Wadsworth, we got her.

1563
01:27:52,957 --> 01:27:55,425
You see, it's like the Mounties.

1564
01:27:55,493 --> 01:27:57,427
We always get our man.

1565
01:27:57,495 --> 01:27:59,360
Mrs. Peacock was a man?

1566
01:28:01,232 --> 01:28:04,030
Would anyone care
for fruit or dessert?

1567
01:28:17,148 --> 01:28:19,582
Sorry, didn't mean
to frighten anyone.

1568
01:28:19,651 --> 01:28:21,141
You're too late!

1569
01:28:21,219 --> 01:28:23,119
Then there were three more murders.

1570
01:28:23,188 --> 01:28:25,383
- Who did it?
- Who did it?

1571
01:28:25,457 --> 01:28:27,948
Let's consider each murder one by one.

1572
01:28:28,026 --> 01:28:30,961
You knew Mr. Boddy was still alive.

1573
01:28:31,029 --> 01:28:33,463
Even psychiatrists
can tell the difference

1574
01:28:33,531 --> 01:28:35,795
between live and dead patients.

1575
01:28:35,867 --> 01:28:37,994
Your shot missed in the dark,

1576
01:28:38,069 --> 01:28:40,867
so you pretended he was dead

1577
01:28:40,939 --> 01:28:43,271
and killed him later, unobserved.

1578
01:28:43,341 --> 01:28:47,277
Right. He was missing
after we found the cook.

1579
01:28:47,345 --> 01:28:50,178
But he was with us
when we found Yvette.

1580
01:28:50,248 --> 01:28:52,045
How'd he kill the cook?

1581
01:28:52,116 --> 01:28:53,105
I didn't!

1582
01:28:53,184 --> 01:28:55,618
You expect us to believe that?

1583
01:28:55,687 --> 01:28:57,985
<i>You</i> should.
You killed the cook--

1584
01:28:58,056 --> 01:29:01,287
your ex-cook,
who informed on you.

1585
01:29:01,359 --> 01:29:03,486
You made one fatal mistake.

1586
01:29:03,561 --> 01:29:06,530
At dinner,
Mrs. Peacock told us she was eating

1587
01:29:06,598 --> 01:29:09,123
one of her favorite recipes.

1588
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:12,658
And monkey's brains,
though popular in Cantonese cuisine,

1589
01:29:12,737 --> 01:29:16,639
are not often to be found
in Washington, D.C.

1590
01:29:16,708 --> 01:29:20,109
Colonel Mustard,
when we saw the motorist,

1591
01:29:20,178 --> 01:29:22,738
you took the key
to the weapons cupboard,

1592
01:29:22,814 --> 01:29:26,215
then you suggested
that we all split up.

1593
01:29:26,284 --> 01:29:29,253
You crossed the hall,
took the wrench,

1594
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,754
ran to the conservatory,
entered the lounge,

1595
01:29:31,823 --> 01:29:34,417
killed the motorist
with a blow on the head...

1596
01:29:34,492 --> 01:29:36,016
like that!

1597
01:29:38,162 --> 01:29:39,595
This is incredible.

1598
01:29:39,664 --> 01:29:42,098
Not so incredible
as what happened next.

1599
01:29:42,166 --> 01:29:44,100
After we all split up again,

1600
01:29:44,168 --> 01:29:46,864
I went upstairs with you, Mrs. White.

1601
01:29:46,938 --> 01:29:50,305
And, while I was
in the master bedroom,

1602
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:54,072
you hurried downstairs
and turned off the electricity,

1603
01:29:54,145 --> 01:29:57,706
got the rope
and throttled Yvette.

1604
01:29:57,782 --> 01:29:59,613
Your husband was shtupping Yvette.

1605
01:29:59,684 --> 01:30:02,118
That's why you killed him, too.

1606
01:30:02,186 --> 01:30:03,118
Yes.

1607
01:30:06,391 --> 01:30:09,326
Yes, I did it.
I killed Yvette.

1608
01:30:09,394 --> 01:30:12,830
I hated her...so...much,

1609
01:30:12,897 --> 01:30:16,333
it--it...the f--
it--flame, flames...

1610
01:30:16,401 --> 01:30:19,131
flames...on the side of my face,

1611
01:30:19,203 --> 01:30:22,764
breathing, breath--
heaving breaths,

1612
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,102
heaving...

1613
01:30:24,175 --> 01:30:27,838
Miss Scarlet crossed to the library

1614
01:30:27,912 --> 01:30:31,211
and hit the cop,
whom she'd been bribing,

1615
01:30:31,282 --> 01:30:32,715
with a lead pipe.

1616
01:30:32,784 --> 01:30:34,581
True or false?

1617
01:30:34,652 --> 01:30:37,644
True. Who are you, Perry Mason?

1618
01:30:37,722 --> 01:30:40,190
So, Mr. Green
shot the singing telegram.

1619
01:30:40,258 --> 01:30:41,225
I didn't!

1620
01:30:41,292 --> 01:30:42,486
Nobody's left.

1621
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,528
But I didn't do it!

1622
01:30:44,596 --> 01:30:48,589
The gun's missing.
Whoever's got the gun, shot the girl.

1623
01:30:48,666 --> 01:30:49,826
I shot her.

1624
01:30:49,901 --> 01:30:50,890
- You?
- You?

1625
01:30:52,437 --> 01:30:53,995
So, it <i>was</i> you.

1626
01:30:54,072 --> 01:30:55,403
I'd planned to expose you.

1627
01:30:55,473 --> 01:30:57,737
I know.
I'd rather expose myself.

1628
01:30:57,809 --> 01:30:59,743
Please.
There are ladies present.

1629
01:30:59,811 --> 01:31:02,177
You thought Mr. Boddy
was dead. Why?

1630
01:31:02,246 --> 01:31:05,181
You'd never met him until tonight.

1631
01:31:05,249 --> 01:31:06,978
You're Mr. Boddy!

1632
01:31:08,486 --> 01:31:09,817
Wait a minute!

1633
01:31:09,887 --> 01:31:11,650
So who did I kill?

1634
01:31:11,723 --> 01:31:13,816
My butler.

1635
01:31:13,891 --> 01:31:15,552
Oh, shucks.

1636
01:31:15,627 --> 01:31:17,561
He was expendable,
like all of you.

1637
01:31:17,629 --> 01:31:19,187
I'm grateful to you all

1638
01:31:19,263 --> 01:31:21,561
for disposing of my network of spies.

1639
01:31:21,633 --> 01:31:23,464
Saved me a lot of trouble.

1640
01:31:23,534 --> 01:31:25,866
Now there's no evidence against me.

1641
01:31:25,937 --> 01:31:27,905
This has nothing to do

1642
01:31:27,972 --> 01:31:30,406
with my disappearing
nuclear physicist husband

1643
01:31:30,475 --> 01:31:33,308
or Colonel Mustard's work
with the fusion bomb?

1644
01:31:33,378 --> 01:31:34,310
No.

1645
01:31:34,379 --> 01:31:36,643
Communism was just a red herring.

1646
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:40,845
The police will be here.

1647
01:31:40,918 --> 01:31:43,352
None of you will get away with this.

1648
01:31:43,421 --> 01:31:46,151
Why should the police come?
Nobody's called them.

1649
01:31:46,224 --> 01:31:47,691
You mean...

1650
01:31:47,759 --> 01:31:48,953
Oh, of course!

1651
01:31:49,027 --> 01:31:51,587
Why shouldn't we
get away with it?

1652
01:31:51,663 --> 01:31:54,097
We'll lock the bodies in the cellar,

1653
01:31:54,165 --> 01:31:55,097
leave quietly,

1654
01:31:55,166 --> 01:31:56,827
and forget this ever happened.

1655
01:31:56,901 --> 01:31:59,995
And you'll go on blackmailing us.

1656
01:32:00,071 --> 01:32:02,062
Of course.
Why not?

1657
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:03,505
I'll tell you why not.

1658
01:32:04,809 --> 01:32:06,071
Aah!

1659
01:32:06,144 --> 01:32:08,578
Oh, good shot, Green.

1660
01:32:20,625 --> 01:32:22,991
Very good.

1661
01:32:30,935 --> 01:32:32,835
Are you a cop?

1662
01:32:32,904 --> 01:32:34,895
No. I'm a plant.

1663
01:32:34,972 --> 01:32:36,667
I thought you were a fruit.

1664
01:32:36,741 --> 01:32:38,208
Very funny.

1665
01:32:38,276 --> 01:32:41,905
F.B.I. That phone call
from J. Edgar Hoover was for me.

1666
01:32:44,182 --> 01:32:46,980
I told you I didn't do it.

1667
01:32:52,223 --> 01:32:54,214
All right, who done it?

1668
01:32:54,292 --> 01:32:56,123
- They...she did...
- That lady...he...

1669
01:32:56,194 --> 01:32:58,128
- This one... I...
- Gentlemen...

1670
01:32:58,196 --> 01:33:00,596
They all did it!

1671
01:33:00,665 --> 01:33:04,101
But if you want to know
who killed Mr. Boddy,

1672
01:33:04,168 --> 01:33:07,399
I did, in the hall,
with the revolver.

1673
01:33:07,472 --> 01:33:10,100
