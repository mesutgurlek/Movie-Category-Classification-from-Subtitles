(music plays)

14
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,796
Cease fire!
Cease fire! Heads up!

15
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:55,216
Man down! Cease fire!

16
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:02,598
(echoes):
Stupid motherfucker!

17
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,559

Sí.

(distant siren wailing)

26
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:55,289
What's up, Sylvia?

27
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,213
Cute little outfit.

28
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,797
You look nice.

29
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:04,798
Mike's in
the bedroom.

30
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:05,883
Yeah?

31
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,802
(TV news playing)

32
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:12,890
Man, I said
you look nice.

33
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,643
I have a court
appearance, Jim.

34
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,811
Well, you just
give 'em hell.

35
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:24,151
Hey.

36
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,237
Spiffy duds, huh?

37
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,655
(door opens)

38
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,573
You look like
a gift-wrapped turd.

39
00:07:29,573 --> 00:07:31,408
Now please leave me alone.
I have to concentrate.

40
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:33,244
I have two filings
and a deposition today.

41
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,912
Play nice, kids.

42
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:37,915
What up, dog?

43
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:40,000
- Nothing. Just got back.
- Cool. Cool.

44
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,502
How was Mexico, dog?

45
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:43,921
Oh, it was a dream, man.

46
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,007
- Loving my woman.
- Right.

47
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,759
That's it.
I'm out of here.

48
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,595
Those are copies
of your resumé.

49
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:52,680
Pass them out like candy.

50
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,098
'Cause I can always
print up more.

51
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:55,933
And just call me
if anything happens, okay?

52
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,769
And no drinking.

53
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,272
Come on, baby, be cool.

54
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,523
Honey, I'm serious.

55
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:04,692
No drinking. Okay?

56
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,027
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

57
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,198
Good luck.

58
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,451
Your suit's fine, okay?

59
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,126
Dude, she called me
a gift-wrapped turd.

60
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,377
(laughing)

61
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,712
Don't be fucking
with her, dude.

62
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,547
She's pissed.

63
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,048
Why is she on
the warpath? Dog...

64
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:31,135
I didn't look for work
yesterday, dude.

65
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:33,971
Sold some of her CDs,
bought a couple of 40s

66
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,806
and a pack of GPCs.

67
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:36,974
Caught a buzz
and watched

68
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,976
my Chicago Vs. Lakers tapes.

69
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,228
(laughs):
That's on you, homie.

70
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:43,480
We didn't even
hang yesterday.

71
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,982
I was out of the country.

72
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:46,984
So? My old lady still
thinks it's your fault.

73
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,235
Huh? Huh? Hmm?

74
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,237
Come on, dude, let's get
the fuck out of here

75
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,488
and find my ass
some employment.

76
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:52,907
It's cool you driving me around?

77
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,491
Yeah, dude, it's cool.
It's no trouble.

78
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:58,162
(music plays)

79
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,330
JIM:
Here, asshole.

80
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,664
Breakfast.

81
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:02,500
Oh... ho, ho...

82
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,335
Dog.

83
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,337
No pisto for me, dude.

84
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,506
Today's a no-pounding day.
You heard the woman.

85
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,341
Good. More for me.

86
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,845
Fuck it.

87
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,681
Salud.
Salud.

88
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,853
Man, hope they put me in
the next class or I'm fucked.

89
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,688
I can't pay my rent.

90
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:27,691
Landlady's about to pull
a gauge on my ass.

91
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:30,194
What happened to all that money
you saved in the army, dude?

92
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:33,113
The tax-free shit?

93
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,950
Man, bro, this fucking
ride cleaned me out.

94
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,701
I guess we drank
up the rest.

95
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,370
(chuckles):
Dumb ass.

96
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,663
(laughing)

97
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:42,540
Cops better start
paying you, dude.

98
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:44,041
You spend enough
fucking time with them.

99
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,460
They better start kicking me
down some paychecks, man.

100
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,629
They got me hopping through
hoops, you know?

101
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:50,965
"Come in for a test."
"Come back in two weeks."

102
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,800
Another test, another two weeks.

103
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,301
Fuck.

104
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,386
Shit gets real,

105
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:56,720
you be hating life.

106
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,722
Party time will be over.

107
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,475
Dude, you don't know how much

108
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,561
I'm looking forward
to this shit.

109
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,896
You know, I'll be super recruit.

110
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,773
I was jumping
out of choppers

111
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,066
in the mountains,
taking down

112
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,069
hard motherfuckers,
you know?

113
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,822
I'll be laughing my way through
LAPD's reindeer games.

114
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,575
Shit, they're
gonna love me.

115
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:19,910
Yeah, yeah, you're gonna
fucking love them, dude.

116
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,996
Ah, fuck you.

117
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,415
I'm going to love my old lady.

118
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:26,250
I'm gonna marry homegirl.

119
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,919
Import her ass.

120
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,421
Oh, come on, man.

121
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,922
Dude, what happened
to all the honeys

122
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,716
we were gonna pimp
with your badge, dog?

123
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:34,758
You're fucking up the plan.

124
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:37,178
I've been thinking, you know?

125
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,430
Love's about sacrifice.

126
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,474
Only true measure of it.

127
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,018
What would you do for Sylvia?

128
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,688
Get a job.

129
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,607
- Mm...
- Nine to fucking five.

130
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:51,442
Yeah.

131
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,943
That's love.

132
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,873
Hey.

133
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:13,881
Good morning.

134
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,302
MIKE:
So when do you officially

135
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:20,054
hand your ass over to the Man?

136
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,974
"Mr. Jim Davis,
we regret to inform...

137
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,395
I had two beers, right?

138
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,813
Yeah.

139
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,148
Going fucking
blind or something.

140
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,150
Okay, this letter
says, quoting...

141
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:38,489
"no longer eligible
as a police officer candidate."

142
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,033
What the fuck does that mean?

143
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,077
Come on, dude.

144
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,746
"no longer eligible"? I mean,
what does that sound like?

145
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,997
They pulled the plug, dude.

146
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:51,085
No, no...

147
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,628
Why?

148
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,006
Oh, man, I'll bet you...

149
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,092
I'll bet you it's
'cause I'm white.

150
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:00,261
I bet it's 'cause
you're a dick.

151
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,012
No, no, no, Mike,
you don't understand.

152
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,848
I am fucked.

153
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,850
I got to get married.

154
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,854
Okay? INS won't let me
bring Marta across

155
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,272
unless I got employment.

156
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,356
I promised her.

157
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:14,191
This fucks up my plan.

158
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,527
This is fucking bullshit, okay?

159
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,029
This... these fucking
assholes...

160
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,366
These fucking assholes!

161
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:24,034
What the fuck
is their problem, man?!

162
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:29,123
This is fucking typical
cop hate game bullshit!

163
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,041
Yo, yo, fucking
chill, Magilla Gorilla.

164
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,459
I mean you're trippin', dude.

165
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:33,544
Hey, what the fuck

166
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,795
are you looking at, asshole?!

167
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,548
Fucking dick.

168
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,549
Yo, yo,

169
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,634
Jim, Jim...

170
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,053
I'm gonna fucking kick your
teeth down your puke hole!

171
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,556
You fucking want some?

172
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,809
Jim, Jim, dude.

173
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,060
Kick back, dude.

174
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,730
The fucking light is green.
Get the fuck in the car.

175
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,064
Man, fuck.
- You're going to catch

176
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,232
a case doing that shit, man.

177
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,483
What the fuck were you doing?

178
00:12:56,483 --> 00:12:58,319
Fuck the LAPD, man.

179
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,321
What's up with Pasadena,
Pomona, Santa Ana and all that?

180
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,239
Oh, no, fuck the sticks.

181
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,241
L.A. City's the shit.

182
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,910
Hey, Sheriff's Department.

183
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,579
It's good enough for the INS
and still basically L.A., right?

184
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,833
Yeah, Sheriff's Department,
yeah.

185
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,086
They make you work
the jails the first two years

186
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,171
or something.

187
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,589
I could be cracking heads

188
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,424
up at the Honor Ranch.

189
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,761
I'll give 'em a call,
start testing.

190
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,930
Yeah.

191
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,348
That's right.

192
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,267
Yo, it's just
a minor setback, right?

193
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,686
Quit trippin', dude.

194
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,855
Shit.

195
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,025
Hey, you know what
I want to do?

196
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,610
What?

197
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,613
I want to get fucked up.

198
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,281
Me, too, man.

199
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,117
I got to find a job and placate
my baby, you know.

200
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,953
Sylvia's going
to kick your ass?

201
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,621
Come on, big man,
she'll be cool.

202
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,374
Come on.

203
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:57,044
(Korean pop music playing)

204
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,468
- Bye, Nicole.
- Bye.

205
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:11,976
Let me get a couple
of singles, too, please.

206
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,978
Sorry, you buy whole pack.

207
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,896
Be cool, dude.

208
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,147
If I buy a whole pack

209
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,816
I'm gonna want
to smoke it.

210
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,151
I just want a couple
of smokes with my beer.

211
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,903
City give me $1,500 ticket.

212
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:23,904
No more.

213
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,990
(speaking Korean)

214
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,011
(speaking Korean)

215
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,345
Asshole.

216
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,184
(speaking Korean)

217
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,853
(yelling)

218
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,190
(gunshots)

219
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,285
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

220
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,703
Oh, shit.

221
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,455
That fucking gangster, man.

222
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,291
Homeboy just ran
a six second four-forty.

223
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,044
Damn, the chino looked
fucking pissed, man.

224
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,962
You think we'll be able
to go back there?

225
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,797
I hate that shit.

226
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,717
Fuckin' chino lookin' at us
like we were gonna bust him?

227
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,719
Come on, dude.
We're wearin' suits, man.

228
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,054
We totally look like cops.

229
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,722
He said he got fined
for that shit.

230
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:32,973
He was just being cautious.

231
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:37,311
Well, we got pisto,
we got frajos.

232
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,396
Only one thing missin'.

233
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,232
Be-at-ches.

234
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,901
Oh, yeah, I mean
besides bitches, man.

235
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,237
Yesca?
Mm-hmm.

236
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,905
Bingo.

237
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,241
I need to feel
some reefer madness.

238
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,077
You sure you want
to score some bud, dude?

239
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,246
You haven't smoked out
since like forever, man.

240
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:58,833
I said I want
to get fucked up, man.

241
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,584
Fuck this purity bullshit.

242
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:05,005
Yeah... fuck purity.

243
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:09,593
Aw, man, look at this
zero-head, dog.

244
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,761
Stupid-ass cholo.

245
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,096
Look at that.

246
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,432
That dude's slangin', dog.

247
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,853
Want to get
a dime?

248
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:22,022
JIM:
No, I want it all.

249
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,114
Go for the stash, man.

250
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,456
Whoa, go, go, go.

251
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,125
Hey, hey, yo, yo.

252
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,294
That's my shit!

253
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,045
Fuck.

254
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,630
(laughing)

255
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,465
Outstanding.

256
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,634
Out-fucking-standing.

257
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,052
That shit was slick.

258
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,138
That motherfucker
just got schooled.

259
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,223
Bitch-ass cholo.

260
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,808
- Check this shit out, huh?
- Yeah.

261
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,144
Nice motherfucking haul.
You see that shit, huh?

262
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,980
Mm. It's not laced either.

263
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,981
Smell that shit.

264
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,149
Smell that motherfucking shit.

265
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,234
We just burned my car.

266
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:08,986
We go back there,
we're gonna get shot.

267
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:09,987
Yeah, no shit.

268
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,988
Man, bust that light.

269
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,823
Roll that shit up.

270
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,825
Yeah, yeah, Cool.

271
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,577
Yo, let's drop off
some resumés first.

272
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,828
Then we'll smoke out, dude.

273
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,996
Some resumés.

274
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,164
Yeah.

275
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,333
Ah, man, fresh air.

276
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,501
Look.

277
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,419
Oh! They're
dropped off, man.

278
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,670
You fucking asshole, man.

279
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,005
I got to get
a fucking job, man.

280
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,340
What's your problem, man?

281
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,674
What the fuck are
you doing, dickhead.

282
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,842
Yo, Mike, first day looking--

283
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,512
nobody ever gets a job
their first day looking.

284
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:38,182
Come on, don't
sweat it, man.

285
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,352
Hey, I can't
fuck around tomorrow.

286
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,603
I got to get a job for sure.

287
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,854
This is your job, man.

288
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,272
So act like a fucking
professional,

289
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,441
spark up the goods, 'cause we
got a lot of work to do.

290
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,787
It's harsh. It's good, though.

291
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,465
You okay?

292
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,467
How are those lungs, baby?

293
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,219
There it is.

294
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,888
That magic feeling.

295
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,828
Damn, look at that bitch.

296
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,580
Oh, damn.

297
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,836
Fuck, yeah.

298
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,421
She's fucking good.

299
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,090
I bet she got skills.
I want to get laid.

300
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:56,260
You just saw your woman.

301
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,761
Only hit her once, man.

302
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,182
We can't go nowhere alone.
They got me sleeping in the car.

303
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:05,936
Family's got that ass
under guard, huh?

304
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,104
Lock and key.

305
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,940
Fuck, I want to get laid.

306
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,110
Pay a visit
to my harem, huh?

307
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,278
Online, pornmeister.

308
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,905
Uh-uh, let's go
to Letty's pad, man.

309
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,781
How much you want to bet
I hit it.

310
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,617
- She won't, dog.
- How much you want to bet?

311
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,993
She won't give you shit, dog.

312
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,620
You big time
fucked her over.

313
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,414
Aw, man, I popped that poodahey.

314
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,667
I got that mind control, man.

315
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,296
How much you want to bet
I get back up in it?

316
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:33,797
20 bucks?

317
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,132
You ain't got 20 bucks.

318
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,134
So, neither do you, man.

319
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,969
Come on, shake on that shit.

320
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,388
Come on.

321
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,724
What the fuck, let's go.

322
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,975
(knocking)

323
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,393
I got it.

324
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,021
What's up, Patty?

325
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,982
- Y tu hermana?
- She ain't here.

326
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,567
Y sabes que?

327
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,653
You're not welcome
in this house.

328
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,822
Sure, Patty.

329
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,991
I'd love to come in.

330
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,744
Thank you.

331
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,996
Are they here?

332
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,296
You're looking fine,
as fuck, chulas.

333
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,507
Don't... don't touch
me, please.

334
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,176
Hey, hey.

335
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,847
You got to get out of here.

336
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,849
Letty...

337
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,018
I just wanted
to see you again.

338
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,024
Hey, Patty, you want to grab
me a pisto or something?

339
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,068
I ain't grabbing you shit.

340
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,444
Oh, you still got
a mouth, huh?

341
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,530
Maybe one day you'll learn
how to keep it shut.

342
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,783
Laters. I'm going to my room.

343
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,078
You know you have to run
his ass out of here.

344
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,708
Baby.

345
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,046
Let's sit down.

346
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:06,140
No, no, no.

347
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:10,227
So, um...

348
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,146
You a cop yet?

349
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,731
I'm working on it.

350
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,066
Y tu?

351
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,069
Que andas haciendo?

352
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,488
Well, you know, I'm going
to L.A. Trade Tech.

353
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,158
It's good you're doing
positive shit.

354
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,506
What, after everything
I don't get a kiss?

355
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:42,259
It's because of everything
you can't get a kiss.

356
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,428
Oh, come on, come here.

357
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,681
Yeah.

358
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,521
Don't.

359
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,273
Jim, I got a boyfriend.

360
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,108
Who?

361
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,444
Flaco.

362
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,445
You're back with that

363
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,781
piece of shit after
what he did, Letty?

364
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,284
You're not fucking him, are you?

365
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,620
Please tell me no.

366
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,456
Yes. So... just go.

367
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,291
'Cause there's nothing
here for you, Jim.

368
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,795
See?

369
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,129
Okay?

370
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,965
I don't believe
this shit, Letty.

371
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,800
You're too good for that.

372
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,099
(car horn blaring)

373
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,141
You gotta go.

374
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,977
Go. Please!

375
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,144
Let me talk to them.

376
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,146
No, Jim, don't
be stupid. Please.

377
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:40,484
Okay? Largate. Just go.

378
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,575
I guess it's later days.

379
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,004
Largate. Just go!

380
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,548
Flaco, the pinchi guero's here!

381
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,842
Apuarte, Jim!
Hurry up!

382
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,927
- Fuck him up!
- I got him!

383
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,866
Fucking white boy!

384
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,704
What's up, faggot?!

385
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,540
We're going to fuck you up!

386
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,542
(all shouting)

387
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,379
Yo! pop the trunk

388
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,631
so I can handle this shit!

389
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,382
Fuck you, puto!

390
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,051
I'll bust you!

391
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,053
Leave him alone!

392
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:53,057
Pop the fucking trunk!

393
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,230
(grunting)

394
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,909
Jim!

395
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,494
(gunshot)

396
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,579
Oh, you fucked up!

397
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,748
Get your fucking knees
down on the curb now!

398
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,416
Get the fuck
over there, man!

399
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,418
Don't fucking move unless you
want your brains hanging out!

400
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,586
What's your problem, Flaco?

401
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,589
Motherfucker!

402
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,591
Fucking knees on the curb, man!

403
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:31,011
That's right!

404
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:35,099
Interlock your fingers
behind your heads, Flaco!

405
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,685
You deaf fuck!

406
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:42,523
Yo, Mike.

407
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,858
Yeah?

408
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:45,276
Do up their ride.

409
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:48,195
Freeze, bitch!

410
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,198
I'm going to take that big ass
of yours home,

411
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,450
hit it for a minute, you know?

412
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,785
Fuck off!

413
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:55,786
Now you got it.

414
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,791
Yo, relax, homie.

415
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:06,130
You break Letty's heart,
I'm coming for your mom.

416
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,298
Fuck!

417
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,969
Hey, haina.

418
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,137
Whoo!

419
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,722
Fuck off!
Oh, yeah?

420
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,640
What you got down here?

421
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,225
(whistles):
Oh...

422
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:19,810
Liking that.

423
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:26,901
Damn! Those are
badass kicks, dog.

424
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,820
Lucky you got little bitch feet,

425
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,239
else I'd be stomping around
in them motherfuckers.

426
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,158
- Fuck you, puto.
- Huh?

427
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,826
- Yeah. Fuck you.
- Yes?

428
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,664
You fucking stay still!

429
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,000
Bitches! If you didn't have
that fucking gun,

430
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,586
ese, it wouldn't
be about shit, homie.

431
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,505
Not fucking shit!

432
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:50,007
Hey, later, Patty!

433
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,842
I hope you're not
pregnant, but you know

434
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,010
you wanted me to blow in you.

435
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,178
Fuck you!

436
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,846
Bye, Letty!

437
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:04,939
Salud.

438
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,273
Salud.

439
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,613
Divvy up the bounty, dude.
I know you got some cash.

440
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,376
I know I got more than that.

441
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,463
Yeah. Here we go.

442
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:30,798
Shit.

443
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:33,050
That's my pussy
she's giving away there.

444
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,804
Homeboy uses extra large.

445
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,556
Man, that's it?
Next time,

446
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,224
jack someone with a job.

447
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:43,894
Well, fuck you.
What did you get, their lunch?

448
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,646
Check it out.

449
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,732
Holy shit.
You're kidding me.

450
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:58,075
Whoo! It's a fucking
Ruger P-94. Nine millimeter.

451
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,995
14, plus one in the chamber.

452
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,746
It's a good fucking gun.
Durable.

453
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,582
It's brand-new.

454
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,669
It's a BB gun.

455
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,087
Yeah. Cool.

456
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,755
Here you go, dog.

457
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,090
About time you got a cohete.

458
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:14,592
No. I don't want it.

459
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,927
Why the fuck not? I'll use it.

460
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,929
That's a good reason. Sell it.

461
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,015
How much you think
we can get for the gun?

462
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,767
Two bills, maybe three.
Costs six new.

463
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,936
We'll sell it
and split the greenery.

464
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:26,937
You sure?

465
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,606
It's cool, dude.

466
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,191
50-50.

467
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,861
Good BB gun though.

468
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,447
Shoot some birds and shit.

469
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,282
Hey, put that shit away.

470
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,783
Looks real as hell.

471
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,119
Not a bad day's work.

472
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,634
Get down to business though.

473
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:59,136
I know you didn't get any.

474
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:00,638
So pay up, motherfucker.

475
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:06,644
Dick.

476
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:13,484
Hello. This is a message
for Michael Alonzo.

477
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:18,322
This is Bob Luell
at the Palm Glen Group.

478
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,407
We have reviewed your resumé,

479
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,160
and would like
to make an appointment

480
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,578
for later in the week.

481
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:25,746
Please call me at your

482
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,581
earliest convenience.

483
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:28,582
Thank you.

484
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,918
Huh? That's good.

485
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,503
One more? This is fun.

486
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,672
Sounded a little gay,
but it was good.

487
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,842
No, no, no. no.
That's it, dude. That's it.

488
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:40,010
I get too many callbacks,

489
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,262
Sylvia's going
to get suspicious.

490
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,930
Oh, Sylvia's going
to be kissing your ass.

491
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,348
Not if she
recognizes your voice.

492
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,350
Oh, she won't. Here, sir.

493
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,018
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm cool.

494
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,520
- Come on.
- I'm cool.

495
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,022
I want to get home before the
little woman and sober up.

496
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,024
Come on, bro. One brew.

497
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:56,360
All right, but hey,

498
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,279
I got to look for a job
tomorrow for sure.

499
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,530
Okay? I can't
be getting fucked up

500
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,614
behind Sylvia's back
when I'm supposed

501
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:01,699
to be looking
for work, man.

502
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,450
Not cool.
Tomorrow, for sure.

503
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,536
I got to find a job, too.

504
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:10,624
(phone rings)

505
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,293
Hello.

506
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:17,131
Yes, sir.

507
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,218
Yes, sir. That is correct.

508
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,720
Six years.

509
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,972
Honorably discharged.

510
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,724
Yes, sir.

511
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:28,559
I would love to.

512
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,645
Believe me, I would
welcome the opportunity.

513
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:34,732
Tomorrow

514
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:37,651
is not a problem.

515
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,987
Thank you, sir.
You have a good day, too.

516
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,740
Good-bye, sir.

517
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,992
That was the man, huh?
You're all "Sir,

518
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,410
sir, sir."

519
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:50,581
Yes! Fucking yes! Thank God!

520
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,921
That was the man!
That was the Federal man!

521
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:59,507
The Federal man!

522
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:00,758
Department of
Homeland Security

523
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,676
wants me to come in
tomorrow to start testing!

524
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:05,596
Oh, shit!

525
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,931
Fucking A, my brother!

526
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:08,265
That shit is righteous,
motherfucker!

527
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,517
It's on, homie!

528
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:11,185
Wow, man.
Tomorrow.

529
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,937
So what the fuck you
going to do now, dude?

530
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,522
I got to take a piss test.

531
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:15,940
If I'm cool,
I'm in the house.

532
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:22,446
Yeah! Oh!

533
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,950
Shit, dude,
do they piss test for weed?

534
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,619
Oh, shit!

535
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,873
You fucked up, man.

536
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,792
Oh, fuck.

537
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,212
I fucked up.

538
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:40,798
Oh, fuck. I fucked up.

539
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,217
Fuck! Oh...

540
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,303
You know, one dope
molecule, and I'm done.

541
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,806
And they will burn me

542
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:51,392
with every law enforcement
outfit in the country.

543
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:52,643
Shit!

544
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:53,978
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, dude.

545
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:57,398
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

546
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,316
Hey, there's a way out
of every fucking situation.

547
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,819
- Right? Relax, dude.
- Yeah, yeah.

548
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,321
Yeah. I'm going to do
what I got to do, you know?

549
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,489
It's cool. Fuck, yeah.

550
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:06,574
I'll pass that shit.

551
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:07,992
Hell, yeah. Yeah.

552
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,411
Of course
you will, dude!

553
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:13,330
Later, loco.

554
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:14,665
Don't fucking trip, dude.

555
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:15,583
All right.

556
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,585
(sighs):
Shit.

557
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:24,842
Eat.

558
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:26,343
(knocking on door)

559
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:27,928
Come in, dumb ass!

560
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,851
What's up, dog?

561
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:34,852
What up, dog...

562
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:37,688
Hey, Jim.
Want some coffee?

563
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:38,772
Sure.

564
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,608
Want some eggs?
There's extra.

565
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,860
Yes, ma'am. Please.

566
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,863
I, uh, heard
about the LAPD.

567
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,781
Sorry about that.

568
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,700
I thought they
guaranteed you a job.

569
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,285
Yea. Me, too.

570
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:54,955
Well, maybe it
wasn't meant to be.

571
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:57,708
You know, you being a cop.

572
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,378
Tell her what's up, dude.

573
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:02,713
Well, I applied

574
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:05,799
to all the Federal
law enforcement agencies.

575
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,134
You know, ATF, Border Patrol,

576
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:08,636
ICE, Homeland Security,
all of them.

577
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:11,388
And Homeland Security's
interested in me.

578
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:13,974
They want me to come in today
and start testing.

579
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:16,477
Wow. That's great.
How sure is this?

580
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,229
Well, I got a urinalysis today.

581
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,481
If I pass that, I'll be
a Special Agent candidate,

582
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:22,483
and then I could
be out of here next month.

583
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,401
You haven't been
smoking out, have you?

584
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:28,155
Nah. Chilled on that shit
a while back.

585
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,407
Good. Well, thanks for driving
Mike around yesterday.

586
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,326
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, bro.

587
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:34,328
Three callbacks.

588
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,997
Damn! Good!

589
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:39,750
We dropped off
enough resumés. Whoo!

590
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:41,252
Got more.

591
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:42,253
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

592
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:43,838
Well, you have
to keep trying

593
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:45,422
until something happens.

594
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,924
Finding a job is a job, right?

595
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,259
Lunch money.

596
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:49,510
Thank you.

597
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:50,845
And good
luck today.

598
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:52,763
Thank you.

599
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:54,265
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

600
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:56,100
Good luck.

601
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,519
And, Jim, good luck
on your pee test.

602
00:32:58,602 --> 00:32:59,770
I hope you studied.

603
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:05,192
I'm going to
cram for it.

604
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:07,611
Man, that's freaky.

605
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:09,697
She was in
a good mood.

606
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,198
Breakfast
and beer money?

607
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,199
Yeah, dude.

608
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:14,618
She heard the
messages last night.

609
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:15,786
She got me a sixer.

610
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,454
I slammed two last night.

611
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:19,123
Out-fuckin'-standing!

612
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,791
Now we know beer is just
a phone call away.

613
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,042
Yeah.

614
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,795
Yeah. We talked shit out
last night, though.

615
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:28,048
You know? Hey, all she wants
is for me to get a job.

616
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,968
I shouldn't be playing her
like that.

617
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:34,388
Dude, you had a good job,

618
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:37,057
with that, uh, with
that Web design shit.

619
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,642
Had, dude. Had.

620
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,895
All right? All that
shit's in India now.

621
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,563
Want a cold one?
No, later.

622
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:43,814
You got any vinegar?

623
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:46,317
Vinegar? What for?

624
00:33:51,322 --> 00:33:53,324
(exhales):
Ah...

625
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:55,326
(groans):
Oh...

626
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:56,410
Damn, dude!

627
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,578
Ah...!

628
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:58,746
(blabbers)

629
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,331
- Man!
- That is fuckin' sick, man.

630
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:02,333
What'd you do that for?

631
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:03,834
- Shuts down the old kidneys.
- Ooh.

632
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,836
Come on, let's roll.

633
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,346
Grab me that bag, dude.

634
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:24,522
Little trick I learned
in the service.

635
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,860
Aw, that's sick, dude.

636
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,530
You're gonna stick
a turkey baster in your dick?

637
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,199
Quit looking, faggot.

638
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,035
You wish.

639
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:43,707
(quiet grunt)

640
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:44,959
(loud groaning)

641
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,460
(groans):
Oh, man.

642
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,795
(yells in pain)
Fuckin'...

643
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:49,380
shit, dude.

644
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:50,464
Oh, fuckin' shit...

645
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:52,132
- (pained grunting)
- Aw...

646
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:55,219
Aw, motherfucker!

647
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,472
(gasps, groans)

648
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,224
Whew!

649
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,725
Ah...

650
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,978
(inhales)

651
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:06,146
(groans)

652
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,148
That was...

653
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:10,818
unpleasant.

654
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:17,575
(quiet groan):
Man...

655
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:19,243
(clears throat softly)

656
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,662
Man, I want to get
this shit over with.

657
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,998
You know, my teeth are floating.

658
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,833
(Jim groans)

659
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,668
Oh...

660
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:30,254
You get those
in the military, dog?

661
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:32,506
I was a Ranger.

662
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,675
Your mom still suck
a mean dick, hmm?

663
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,427
Gotcha! Shouldn't ignore people.

664
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:38,012
Why don't you go
fuck yourself!

665
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,180
Hey!

666
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,598
Let's play nice,

667
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:42,183
boys.

668
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:45,269
I have everyone's "Consent to
Urinalysis" form signed

669
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:46,353
and dated, am I right?

670
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:47,354
ALL:
Yes, sir.

671
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:49,356
Good. I'm Agent Richards.

672
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,025
Jackets off.

673
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:53,194
I will now administer
the easiest test

674
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:55,196
Homeland Security
will ever give you,

675
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,614
the whizz quiz.

676
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:59,033
Roll up both sleeves
past the elbow.

677
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:05,289
Remove all gloves, rings,
watches, bracelets,

678
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:09,627
jewelry, Band-Aids
and bandages.

679
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,214
I want to see nothing
but bare hands and forearms.

680
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:15,799
Wiggle your fingers.

681
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:18,552
Let me see
both sides.

682
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:20,387
Beautifully done.

683
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,515
Again, gentlemen,
no talking.

684
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:23,807
Detweiler, is it?

685
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,726
You're with me.

686
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,730
(blows sharply)

687
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:37,321
(blows softly)

688
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:38,989
(blows loudly)

689
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:40,491
(whispers):
Fucker.

690
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:43,494
(door opens, closes)

691
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,665
RICHARDS:
Next!

692
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:52,753
Name?

693
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:54,922
Davis, Jim.

694
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:56,590
Ah, the Ranger.

695
00:36:56,674 --> 00:36:58,008
Yes, sir.

696
00:36:58,092 --> 00:37:01,011
- You serve?
- 101st.

697
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,514
- High speed.
- All right.

698
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:05,432
Think you can fill that, son?

699
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:08,143
I could fill
a goddamn trash can, sir.

700
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:11,188
(laughs): You're full of piss
and vinegar, aren't you, Jim?

701
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:13,357
Yes, sir.

702
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,861
##

703
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:19,613
Hey, unload that shit before
you clown with it, okay?

704
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:21,365
I don't want my head
blown off

705
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:22,741
just when I'm getting
it straight.

706
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,954
Pop! What's it like

707
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:28,455
to just straight-up
whack a motherfucker?

708
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:31,584
What's it like?
I mean, what the fuck, you know?

709
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,128
It's like nothing.
What's it supposed to be like?

710
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:35,504
You tell me.

711
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:37,840
You were busting heads
for the military.

712
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:40,384
I can't talk about
this shit, Mike.

713
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:46,974
But I will tell you one
thing-- you point and shoot,

714
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,810
pop, pop, move on, fuck 'em,
they shouldn't have been there,

715
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:51,395
you move the fuck on.

716
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:55,399
You do not stop
and think about it.

717
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,651
- It's not a big deal.
- So if it's nothing,

718
00:37:57,735 --> 00:37:59,069
then what you getting
all mad for?

719
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:00,279
I'm not getting mad.

720
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:01,739
I just hate stupid
questions, Mike.

721
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:03,908
You think you killed
a lot of Commies?

722
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:05,993
- They weren't Commies, dumb ass.
- Then what were they?

723
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:08,412
You know what they were--
they were fuckin' Hajjis,

724
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:10,956
terrorists, the bad guys.

725
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:14,001
Did you like it?
(quietly): Oh, shit.

726
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:16,003
Did you dig it?

727
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,422
You bust a nut?
(popping sound)

728
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:22,259
Not fuckin' now, man.
Seriously.

729
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:25,930
You're killing my buzz, dude.

730
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:28,432
Aw, kick back, stress case.

731
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:30,768
Are we on a mission to
sell this piece or what?

732
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:31,936
Hell, yeah.

733
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:33,354
Let's sell this
fuckin' piece.

734
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:35,981
Got to get some scratch,
you know what I'm saying?

735
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:36,774
Pop! Pop! Pop!

736
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:41,111
(dog barking in distance)

737
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:46,033
(loud music playing over stereo)

738
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:49,870
# Don't lay your funky trip
on me... #

739
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,622
Yo, Darrel!

740
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:54,291
- Yo, yo, yo, Darrel!
- Wake the fuck up, Darrel!

741
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,793
- (loud music continues)
- (banging on door)

742
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:57,127
Darrel!

743
00:38:57,211 --> 00:38:59,421
Come on, come on, come on,
wake up and fuckin'

744
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,048
shine!

745
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,092
(loud music continues)

746
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:09,098
Y'all need to knock
this shit off right now.

747
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,560
- (Mike chuckling)
- Hey, what's up, bro?

748
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:14,395
(both talking indistinctly)

749
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:15,855
Come on in, motherfuckers.

750
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:17,314
(mocking gibberish)
Yeah.

751
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:19,149
Get your little
ass up in here.

752
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,276
Shit!

753
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:21,610
# Brother, please! #

754
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:23,487
Oh, man...

755
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:25,823
y'all scared
the fuck out of me, man.

756
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:26,907
(chuckling)

757
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,410
You motherfuckers
got ties on.

758
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,328
I saw that city-lookin'
car pull up--

759
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:33,497
I thought y'all was
some rollers or shit.

760
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:35,499
(chuckles quietly)

761
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:36,959
I just got out of County.

762
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:40,337
- $9,600.
- No shit. When?

763
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:42,173
Yesterday.

764
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:43,841
MIKE: Damn. What'd
they put on you?

765
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:44,800
Some bullshit.

766
00:39:44,842 --> 00:39:47,011
I saw some wrong-ass shit

767
00:39:47,011 --> 00:39:48,262
up in there, dude.

768
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,431
I ain't ever going back
to that motherfucker.

769
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:52,016
It scared you straight, huh?

770
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:54,685
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, you get booty-played?

771
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:56,687
(laughing)

772
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,022
Hell, no.

773
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,107
You over there tickling
your brown eye, dog?

774
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:02,610
They-they put some jelly
on there, serve some syrup?

775
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:04,612
- You toss the salad?
- Hey, you know, nigga,

776
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:08,449
I kept my ass to the wall
and my mouth shut.

777
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:09,700
Shoot.

778
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,911
I almost lost my job
over that shit.

779
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:13,537
Fuckin' around in there.

780
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:18,959
Oh, God...

781
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:20,794
- You a cop?
- Nope.

782
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:22,588
Rejected his ass.

783
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:23,714
Fuck you.

784
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:25,299
I'm getting
in the Feds' car.

785
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:28,469
(laughs):
Damn...!

786
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:30,804
That's what I'm talking about!

787
00:40:30,888 --> 00:40:32,723
Ah, you hear that?

788
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:35,309
This motherfucker
gonna be a Fed.

789
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:37,186
Yeah.

790
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:39,396
You been wanting that shit, too.

791
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,357
It's my dream, dude.

792
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:43,192
So, you gonna do
that shit right,

793
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:46,237
or, you know, you gonna do
a little shit on the side?

794
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:48,405
I'm gonna get
my own thing going.

795
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,991
You know, I'll be flipping shit,
make a little money.

796
00:40:51,075 --> 00:40:53,410
- You know?
- (laughing)

797
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:57,248
This motherfucker
gonna have shit wired.

798
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:59,583
Scary, huh?

799
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:00,918
(Jim clears throat)

800
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:04,421
Check this shit out.

801
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,756
Oh, hello!

802
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:07,258
(chuckles):
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

803
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:09,009
This is sweet!

804
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:11,679
We jacked some eses.
Got a BB gun, too.

805
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:14,014
- A BB gun?
- Yo.

806
00:41:14,098 --> 00:41:16,267
Goddamn!

807
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:19,186
This is a nice little machine.

808
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,230
Three bills, it's yours.

809
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,190
I ain't got
three bills, dog.

810
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:26,277
My lawyer cleaned me out.

811
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:27,778
(sighs):
Man...

812
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:31,157
I ain't got no ways
or means, homie.

813
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:34,451
I need this shit, too.

814
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:37,454
Bring the heat
to these motherfuckers

815
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:39,373
trippin' around here.

816
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:42,293
We need ends, dog.

817
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:46,255
Who'll give us
three bills for it?

818
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:48,090
Hey, uh, I know a cat.

819
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,634
Hangs out at, uh... La Licha

820
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:51,760
on, uh, Santa Fe.

821
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:53,554
Yeah, I know that place.
He cool?

822
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,890
Oh, man, he's old school,
real cool.

823
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:57,308
Veterano named Eddie.

824
00:41:57,308 --> 00:41:59,643
He there today?

825

00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:02,313
Mm.

827

Yeah. Yeah, I'll hook you up.
Don't worry about it.

828
00:42:05,316 --> 00:42:06,484
Cool, cool.

That's a sweet-ass
piece, though.

Motherfuckers like y'all

890
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:25,956
Hey, Jim.

891
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:28,918
We should lose

892
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:34,423

893
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:56,654
Quien es?

00:45:10,668 --> 00:45:12,586

896
00:45:14,004 --> 00:45:15,089
Damn.

(whistles appreciatively)

898
00:45:17,675 --> 00:45:20,553
Hey, dog, I don't
think they like us here.

899
00:45:20,594 --> 00:45:21,595
Fuck 'em.

900
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:23,138
I got my shit.

901
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:25,599
They make a move,
I'm blasting.

902
00:45:27,101 --> 00:45:29,603
Which one of these fools
is Eddy?

903
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,190
Yeah. I don't know.

904
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,277
They're all paisas here.

905
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:42,533
Hey, why don't you ask
that homegirl right there?

906
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,047
Sientate, guapa.

907
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:58,048
Mm.

908
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:59,133

00:46:00,176 --> 00:46:01,302
Que bien.

911
00:46:01,385 --> 00:46:03,888
Sabas donde esta
el Eddy?

912
00:46:03,971 --> 00:46:06,390
Eddy, te hablan.

913
00:46:13,189 --> 00:46:15,232
Que paso?

914
00:46:15,232 --> 00:46:17,151
Do I know you?

915
00:46:17,151 --> 00:46:19,570
My homeboy Darrell said
to talk to you.

916
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:22,656
Darrell?
Yeah.

917
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:25,326
I'm Jim, homie.

918
00:46:27,578 --> 00:46:29,997
What's up, man? Mike, dog.

919
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,416
All right.
So what's up?

920
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:34,251
Need a cohete?

921
00:46:35,753 --> 00:46:37,588
Maybe.

922
00:46:42,259 --> 00:46:43,260
What kind?

923
00:46:43,344 --> 00:46:45,346
Ruger P-94, brand-new.

924
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:46,931
Ruger, huh?
Yeah.

925
00:46:46,931 --> 00:46:47,932
How many mags?

926
00:46:48,015 --> 00:46:49,934
One high cap.
I'll throw in the hollow points.

927
00:46:52,102 --> 00:46:53,437
Strictly Black Talons, homes.

928
00:46:53,437 --> 00:46:55,689
Homies be wearing
vests these days,

929
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:57,024
know what
I'm saying?

930
00:46:57,107 --> 00:46:58,025
Is it new?

931
00:46:58,108 --> 00:46:59,944
Yeah, it's brand-new.

932
00:47:00,027 --> 00:47:01,695
Where's it at?

00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:02,947
I can get it.

934
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:07,034
How much?

935
00:47:07,117 --> 00:47:09,453
Three bills.

936
00:47:09,453 --> 00:47:10,955
I'll give you $250
if it's new.

937
00:47:10,955 --> 00:47:12,289
If not, I'll give you $200.

938
00:47:17,461 --> 00:47:19,713
Cool.

939
00:47:19,797 --> 00:47:23,217
You got the feria, homie?

944
00:47:33,978 --> 00:47:34,979
Hey, guero, you like her?

945
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:37,898
I do need to get laid.

946
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:39,733
There it is right

947
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:40,985
Yo, give me that cohete.

949
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:58,836
Mataste a un flor.

00:48:06,093 --> 00:48:07,344
Oh, shit!

951
00:48:07,344 --> 00:48:08,929
Open the fucking door!

952
00:48:11,348 --> 00:48:12,683
(engine starts)

953
00:48:18,856 --> 00:48:19,857
MIKE:
Holy shit, dude!

954
00:48:19,857 --> 00:48:21,775
(laughing)

955
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:23,027
You think he's gonna
fuckin' die?!

956
00:48:23,027 --> 00:48:24,945
Sure. Got his carotid.

957
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:26,780
Fucker was garden-hosing.

958
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,781
He'll bleed out.

959
00:48:27,781 --> 00:48:29,033
Oh, shit, dude,

960
00:48:29,033 --> 00:48:31,035
I've seen dudes get shot, man,
but I never seen

961
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:32,536
no motherfucking shit

962
00:48:32,536 --> 00:48:34,955
Fucked his shit up, you know?

00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:37,208
Quick as shit, too.
That crack-crack!

964
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:39,877
Turned that vato into
a fountain of blood.

965
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,545
Why the fuck
did he do that, man?

966
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:43,547
That shit could have been
over anything, you know?

967
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:45,132
Money, drugs, bitches,
respect, whatever.

968
00:48:45,216 --> 00:48:46,550
That homie, straight-up pimp.

969
00:48:46,634 --> 00:48:48,552
You know, maybe he turned out
that dude's daughter.

970
00:48:48,552 --> 00:48:49,637
Looney tunes and shit,

971
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,138
glass all stuck
in his fuckin' neck.

972
00:48:51,222 --> 00:48:53,057
Did you see all that fuckin'
blood over there?!

973
00:48:53,057 --> 00:48:55,392
Yeah, man, the human body's
got a gallon.

974
00:48:55,392 --> 00:48:58,479
Damn!

975
00:48:58,562 --> 00:49:01,482
I coulda boned Gracie.

976
00:49:01,482 --> 00:49:04,235
She had that proper thickness.

977
00:49:04,235 --> 00:49:05,236
Look at me, dog.

978
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:07,238
Look at me.

979
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:10,074
I'm fuckin' traumatized

980
00:49:10,074 --> 00:49:13,828
Yo, homie, that shit

981
00:49:13,911 --> 00:49:16,247
Oh, man,

982
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,833
Trashcanistan.

983
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:22,336
My battle buddy, he got his legs
and arms blown off

984
00:49:22,336 --> 00:49:24,755
by a booby-trapped motorcycle.

985
00:49:24,755 --> 00:49:28,008
Medic saved his ass
and he lived.

986
00:49:28,092 --> 00:49:31,929
He didn't want to, but he did.

987
00:49:31,929 --> 00:49:33,347
I got to face my woman.

988
00:49:33,347 --> 00:49:35,683
How in the fuck am I supposed
to play this shit off, huh?

989
00:49:35,683 --> 00:49:37,768
Man, you'll do it, player.

990
00:49:39,687 --> 00:49:42,773
(siren wails in distance)

991
00:49:46,277 --> 00:49:48,028
Hey, baby girl,
you cooking?

992
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:49,446
Yeah. Where have you been?

993
00:49:49,446 --> 00:49:50,948
Oh, Jim's pad.

994
00:49:50,948 --> 00:49:52,283
You been drinking?

995
00:49:52,283 --> 00:49:53,951
Oh, you know,
I had a few brews.

996
00:49:53,951 --> 00:49:55,369
A few?
Yeah.

997
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:56,620
You look wasted.

998
00:49:58,956 --> 00:49:59,957
(gasps)

999
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,041
Don't trip, girl.

1000
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,293
I've been working
all day.

1001
00:50:02,293 --> 00:50:06,630
I've been looking
for work all day.

1002
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:09,633
I wish I could hang out and
get wasted like the old days.

1003
00:50:09,633 --> 00:50:11,468
You know what?

1004
00:50:11,468 --> 00:50:13,804
When I'm working,
you can lounge.

1005
00:50:13,804 --> 00:50:15,723
I'll fix this place up,

1006
00:50:15,723 --> 00:50:17,141
get you nice clothes
and stuff...

1007
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:18,392
Mike, Mike, Mike.

1008
00:50:18,475 --> 00:50:20,978
It doesn't have anything
to do with money.

1009
00:50:20,978 --> 00:50:22,396
Come here.

1010
00:50:22,396 --> 00:50:25,816
Sit down. I want
to talk to you.

1011
00:50:25,816 --> 00:50:27,401
Hey, it's not
about stuff.

1012
00:50:27,401 --> 00:50:30,404
It's about you and me
needing an equal partner.

1013
00:50:30,488 --> 00:50:31,906
Right.

1014
00:50:31,906 --> 00:50:34,074
Hey, I know that you
supported me through college

1015
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:35,576
and I'm gonna always

1016
00:50:35,576 --> 00:50:36,744
- owe you for that.
- Right.

1017
00:50:36,744 --> 00:50:37,995
Now everything's flipped

1018
00:50:38,078 --> 00:50:39,663
and I feel like I'm doing
everything alone.

1019
00:50:39,663 --> 00:50:43,751
You know, sometimes
I feel like you're my kid.

1020
00:50:43,751 --> 00:50:45,753
I mean, you sneak
around like one.

1021
00:50:45,836 --> 00:50:47,004
Oh-ho!

1022
00:50:47,004 --> 00:50:50,090
Look... Wow, dude.

1023
00:50:50,174 --> 00:50:52,426
I'm sorry.

1024
00:50:52,426 --> 00:50:53,427
Be cool, baby girl,

1025
00:50:53,511 --> 00:50:54,929
I'm on a mission
to get my shit together.

1026
00:50:54,929 --> 00:50:57,515
I applied at this commercial
realty company in Studio City,

1027
00:50:57,598 --> 00:50:59,850
and this black guy,
he was the office manager

1028
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:01,101
and he's fuckin' hella cool,

1029
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:02,937
you know? We're talkin'
and all that shit.

1030
00:51:02,937 --> 00:51:05,189
You know? We're just kickin' it
and all that.

1031
00:51:05,272 --> 00:51:07,691
Did you, did you
check the messages?

1032
00:51:09,527 --> 00:51:12,029
Four messages.

1033
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:13,697
DARRELL:
Mr. Alonzo, I'm calling

1034
00:51:13,781 --> 00:51:16,367
from Sunhouse Properties
to schedule an interview.

1035
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:18,953
Honey, this is great!

1036
00:51:18,953 --> 00:51:21,872
Mm, mm...
Oh! Oh...

1037
00:51:21,872 --> 00:51:23,874
You better call him
first thing in the morning.

1038
00:51:23,874 --> 00:51:25,459
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1039
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:28,879
MIKE:
Oh, damn, dog,
that shit was good, dude.

1040
00:51:28,879 --> 00:51:31,382
Damn, they should give you
a fuckin' Oscar for that shit.

1041
00:51:31,465 --> 00:51:33,968
(machine beeps)

1042
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:44,061
You just stood there

1043
00:51:44,061 --> 00:51:48,065
and you fed me a line of
bullshit like it was nothing.

1044
00:51:48,149 --> 00:51:51,902
You should be
the lawyer.

1045
00:51:51,986 --> 00:51:54,488
How could you just do that?

1046
00:51:54,572 --> 00:51:58,242
How could you look me in the eye
and lie to me like that?

1047
00:51:58,242 --> 00:51:59,326
I'm sorry.

1048
00:51:59,326 --> 00:52:01,912
I'd rather you hit me.

1049
00:52:03,414 --> 00:52:05,249
I'm your clown.

1050
00:52:05,332 --> 00:52:06,834
I'm your fucking clown.

1051
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:10,421
And you and Jim
are laughing at me?

1052
00:52:10,421 --> 00:52:12,423
No, it's not...

1053
00:52:12,506 --> 00:52:16,760
No, no, no, you are so utterly,
irrevocably busted!

1054
00:52:20,431 --> 00:52:22,850
Why don't you just go play
with your little butt buddy?

1055
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,852
Go cook up more lies.

1056
00:52:24,852 --> 00:52:26,854
You know, I bet
you're doing lines again.

1057
00:52:26,854 --> 00:52:29,523
Dude, how could you say
that shit?

1058
00:52:29,607 --> 00:52:30,774
I'm not fuckin'
doing lines again.

1059
00:52:30,858 --> 00:52:32,359
Yeah, right, right.

1060
00:52:32,443 --> 00:52:34,028
I'm not fuckin'
doing lines again!

1061
00:52:34,111 --> 00:52:36,614
Right now your word
is less than shit.

1062
00:52:36,614 --> 00:52:38,699
Maybe you should go.

1063
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:42,620
Just fuckin' go.

1064
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:46,790
Just fuckin'... just go, right?

1065
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:48,375
Fuck it.
I'll fuckin' go!

1066
00:52:48,459 --> 00:52:49,543
Please, go. Go!

1067
00:52:49,543 --> 00:52:51,462
Fuck it then!
I'll fuckin' go!

1068
00:52:51,545 --> 00:52:53,130
Then go, Mike!

1069
00:52:53,214 --> 00:52:54,298
I'm serious!
I'll fuckin' go

1070
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:55,549
except I won't fuckin'
come back!

1071
00:52:55,633 --> 00:52:56,800
You want me to fuckin' go?!

1072
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,801
Fuckin' go, Mike!

1073
00:52:57,885 --> 00:52:59,136
I'll fuckin' go then!

1074
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,137
I'll fuckin' go!

1075
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:03,140
Get the fuck outta here!

1076
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:05,476
(phone rings)

1077
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,483
Hello?

1078
00:53:12,566 --> 00:53:16,237
Speaking.

1079
00:53:16,237 --> 00:53:20,491
Of course, sir. Absolutely.

1080
00:53:20,491 --> 00:53:23,577
Thank you very much,
Agent Richards.

1081
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:25,663
Thank you, sir.

1082
00:53:30,835 --> 00:53:31,836
Who was that?

1083
00:53:31,919 --> 00:53:33,254
That was the feds,
my friend.

1084
00:53:33,337 --> 00:53:36,924
I've been informed that I passed
my urinalysis

1085
00:53:37,007 --> 00:53:39,426
and they would like me
to go in this morning

1086
00:53:39,426 --> 00:53:42,680
to start formal testing.

1087
00:53:42,763 --> 00:53:44,181
Fuck yeah, dude.

1088
00:53:44,265 --> 00:53:45,349
I'll be there all day,

1089
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:48,435
so take my ride,
get your ass a job.

1090
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:49,520
Let's go.

1091
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,855
Oh, shit!

1092
00:53:50,855 --> 00:53:54,525
Come on. Get your
parasitic ass in gear.

1093
00:53:54,608 --> 00:53:58,612
(groans)

1094
00:53:58,612 --> 00:54:02,533
I had some twisted-ass dreams
about that dude being killed.

1095
00:54:02,616 --> 00:54:04,535
I slept like a baby.

1096
00:54:04,618 --> 00:54:08,038
I heard screaming.

1097
00:54:08,038 --> 00:54:09,623
What kind of tests?

1098
00:54:09,623 --> 00:54:12,459
Psychological tests.

1099
00:54:12,459 --> 00:54:15,713
Geez, you're
a freakin' psycho, dude.

1100
00:54:15,796 --> 00:54:17,214
Don't answer that shit
honestly.

1101
00:54:17,214 --> 00:54:19,717
Hell no.

1102
00:54:19,717 --> 00:54:23,053
They use the Minnesota
Multiphasic Inventory.

1103
00:54:23,137 --> 00:54:27,224
It's like 600 questions,
cross-referenced

1104
00:54:27,308 --> 00:54:29,310
to detect deception.

1105
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:30,811
They ask the same shit

1106
00:54:30,895 --> 00:54:32,813
six different ways.
It's lame.

1107
00:54:32,897 --> 00:54:34,732
You'll ace it.

1108
00:54:34,732 --> 00:54:38,319
Dude, I'm gonna pull it off.

1109
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:41,906
All I needed was a shot.

1110
00:54:41,989 --> 00:54:43,741
Gotta play the system.

1111
00:54:43,741 --> 00:54:47,077
Like a piano.

1112
00:54:56,003 --> 00:54:57,588
You done
with that crap, son?

1113
00:54:57,671 --> 00:54:58,923
Yes, sir.

1114
00:54:58,923 --> 00:55:01,592
Let's grab some coffee
while these guys finish up.

1115
00:55:01,592 --> 00:55:03,677
Bring that with you.

1116
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:06,680
(whispers):
I see dumb people.

1117
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:12,102
We reviewed
your LAPD package.

1118
00:55:12,102 --> 00:55:14,688
Since they ran your background,
physical and psych,

1119
00:55:14,688 --> 00:55:16,774
we're going with
their paper.

1120
00:55:16,774 --> 00:55:18,359
- Navy sucks.
- Army swallows.

1121
00:55:18,442 --> 00:55:20,277
Took a little work to
pry your jacket loose

1122
00:55:20,361 --> 00:55:21,779
from their people.

1123
00:55:21,779 --> 00:55:24,365
They don't much like us poaching
from their applicant pool.

1124
00:55:24,448 --> 00:55:25,950
Move it, dirt bag.

1125
00:55:27,451 --> 00:55:28,953
Why'd they drop me?

1126
00:55:28,953 --> 00:55:31,455
Someone here make a call?

1127
00:55:31,455 --> 00:55:32,873
Nope.

1128
00:55:32,957 --> 00:55:34,208
They dropped you
on psych, Jim.

1129
00:55:35,626 --> 00:55:37,711
You blew
their profiles.

1130
00:55:37,795 --> 00:55:40,464
We're all a little
goofy here.

1131
00:55:40,464 --> 00:55:43,133
You'd rather be with us,
wouldn't you?

1132
00:55:43,217 --> 00:55:44,802
Absolutely, sir.

1133
00:55:44,802 --> 00:55:47,137
Good answer.

1134
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:48,639
Have a seat.

1135
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:51,892
Said you were bilingual
on your app.

1136
00:55:51,976 --> 00:55:53,561
They want to test your Spanish.

1137
00:55:53,644 --> 00:55:55,980
We can get that going
if you got time.

1138
00:55:56,063 --> 00:55:57,815
Yes. Sure.

1139
00:55:57,898 --> 00:55:59,400
Who's "they"?

1140
00:55:59,483 --> 00:56:00,985
Your fans upstairs.

1141
00:56:01,068 --> 00:56:02,903
Fans upstairs? Who?

1142
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:05,489
This is some shit
above my pay grade,

1143
00:56:05,573 --> 00:56:09,076
but some very important people
have an eye on you, Jim.

1144
00:56:13,414 --> 00:56:14,999
RECEPTIONIST:
Westside Realty Management.

1145
00:56:15,082 --> 00:56:16,750
How may I direct your call?

1146
00:56:16,834 --> 00:56:17,835
(distant phone ringing)

1147
00:56:17,835 --> 00:56:19,003
Please hold.

1148
00:56:19,086 --> 00:56:22,339
Okay, Mike...

1149
00:56:22,339 --> 00:56:23,841
Alonzo?

1150
00:56:23,841 --> 00:56:25,259
Oh, shit. Joe?!

1151
00:56:25,342 --> 00:56:26,677
Damn...!
What's up, dog?

1152
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,762
- Mikey, look at you.
- What are you doing here, dude?

1153
00:56:28,846 --> 00:56:30,764
Mikey, man, check you out.

1154
00:56:30,764 --> 00:56:32,016
What the fuck you doing here?

1155
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:33,434
Fucking grew up. I work here.

1156
00:56:33,517 --> 00:56:35,019
- Get out of here.
- Yeah.

1157
00:56:35,102 --> 00:56:36,770
Dude, you got to come on up.

1158
00:56:36,854 --> 00:56:38,022
Yeah, I'll show you
the office.

1159
00:56:38,105 --> 00:56:39,523
Fuck, you're gonna trip, man,

1160
00:56:39,523 --> 00:56:40,941
I can see the ocean
and everything.

1161
00:56:40,941 --> 00:56:43,360
Check you out, fucking
ocean view and all that.

1162
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,362
You're wearing a suit now.

1163
00:56:45,362 --> 00:56:46,947
- Got your hair cut.
- Hey, watch out, baby.

1164
00:56:47,031 --> 00:56:48,115
Yeah. Tag no more, huh?

1165
00:56:48,199 --> 00:56:49,533
No, man.

1166
00:56:49,617 --> 00:56:51,035
Dude, what's up with
your brother, Pedro?

1167
00:56:51,035 --> 00:56:53,120
Oh, man, he's in Iraq.
He's in a forward unit.

1168
00:56:53,204 --> 00:56:55,039
Get the fuck out of here. Yeah.

1169
00:56:55,122 --> 00:56:57,291
(muttering):
Fuckin' Mexicans.

1170
00:56:59,293 --> 00:57:00,211
Bye, sweetie.

1171
00:57:03,797 --> 00:57:05,966
Thank you, sir.
I need me some of this, man.

1172
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:07,384
I've been taking piss all day.

1173
00:57:07,384 --> 00:57:08,385
Dude!

1174
00:57:08,385 --> 00:57:09,220
What?

1175
00:57:09,303 --> 00:57:10,221
You're not going to

1176
00:57:10,304 --> 00:57:11,388
- fucking believe this.
- What?

1177
00:57:11,472 --> 00:57:13,557
- I had an interview today.
- Yeah?

1178
00:57:13,641 --> 00:57:15,059
- Remember Crazy Joe?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1179
00:57:15,142 --> 00:57:16,977
Dude stomped that guy's
face in at Taco Land

1180
00:57:17,061 --> 00:57:18,979
for grabbing his chick's ass.

1181
00:57:19,063 --> 00:57:20,564
Homeboy got his shit
together, man.

1182
00:57:20,564 --> 00:57:21,649
Went to UCLA.

1183
00:57:21,649 --> 00:57:23,901
Works at this office
up in Century City.

1184
00:57:23,901 --> 00:57:25,319
I got the hookup, dog.

1185
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:27,488
- 12 an hour.
- Hoo-hoo!

1186
00:57:27,488 --> 00:57:29,156
- That's a lot of lettuce.
- That's right.

1187
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,825
And in three months,
I get benefits.

1188
00:57:30,908 --> 00:57:31,909
Damn! Benefits?

1189
00:57:31,909 --> 00:57:33,661
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Shit!

1190
00:57:33,661 --> 00:57:34,829
Yeah!

1191
00:57:34,912 --> 00:57:36,497
It's not for sure yet,
though, dude.

1192
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:38,165
I still got to
meet the owner, right.

1193
00:57:38,249 --> 00:57:39,917
But he says I'm straight.

1194
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:41,252
It's all good, you know.

1195
00:57:41,335 --> 00:57:43,254
You're in.
Dude...

1196
00:57:43,254 --> 00:57:44,755
I'm in.
Oh, shit.

1197
00:57:44,755 --> 00:57:46,257
Yeah...
What happened?

1198
00:57:46,257 --> 00:57:47,842
They want my ass, man.
Going back tomorrow

1199
00:57:47,925 --> 00:57:49,260
for a polygraph test.

1200
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,512
If I pass that, they'll
send me to Georgia next week.

1201
00:57:51,512 --> 00:57:53,597
Oh...! Damn!
It's like that?!

1202
00:57:53,597 --> 00:57:54,932
What's up, lawman?

1203
00:57:54,932 --> 00:57:56,267
Whoo-hoo!

1204
00:57:56,267 --> 00:57:57,935
How you gonna pass
a lie detector test,

1205
00:57:57,935 --> 00:57:59,603
- you lying motherfucker?
- Aw, easy, man.

1206
00:57:59,603 --> 00:58:02,439
After every question,
you just fucking squeeze

1207
00:58:02,439 --> 00:58:04,108
like you're taking
a dump, you know, man.

1208
00:58:04,108 --> 00:58:06,193
- It throws the machine off. Ooh!
- Oh, dog.

1209
00:58:06,277 --> 00:58:07,945
You're gonna shit your
pants like that, bro.

1210
00:58:08,028 --> 00:58:09,113
Fuck, I think I just did.

1211
00:58:09,196 --> 00:58:10,781
All right, Jim,

1212
00:58:10,865 --> 00:58:12,700
I'm going to ask you
some control questions

1213
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,952
before we get
to the good stuff.

1214
00:58:15,035 --> 00:58:17,454
They can be answered
just "yes" or "no."

1215
00:58:17,538 --> 00:58:20,708
Just relax and
respond naturally.

1216
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:21,792
(mouse clicks)

1217
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:22,877
Are you ready?

1218
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,878
Yes, sir.

1219
00:58:23,961 --> 00:58:26,297
You can just answer
"yes" or "no."

1220
00:58:27,381 --> 00:58:28,716
(mouse clicks)

1221
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,719
"Is your name
Jim Luther Davis?"

1222
00:58:31,802 --> 00:58:33,470
Yes.

1223
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:36,056
"Do you live in Los Angeles?"

1224
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,642
Yes.

1225
00:58:38,642 --> 00:58:41,562
"Are you 26 years old?"

1226
00:58:41,562 --> 00:58:42,646
Yes.

1227
00:58:44,148 --> 00:58:45,816
"Are you married?"

1228
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,651
No.

1229
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,405
(mouse clicks)

1230
00:58:51,489 --> 00:58:52,907
"Are you wearing shoes?"

1231
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:56,410
Yes.

1232
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:59,497
"Have you ever smoked
marijuana?"

1233
00:58:59,497 --> 00:59:03,834
Yes.

1234
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:06,837
"Aside from the occasion you
mentioned in your application?"

1235
00:59:06,837 --> 00:59:08,672
No.

1236
00:59:12,009 --> 00:59:14,678
Jim, knock it off.

1237
00:59:16,597 --> 00:59:17,848
What, sir?

1238
00:59:17,932 --> 00:59:19,934
Son, I've been doing
polygraph examinations

1239
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:23,187
since you were swimming
in your daddy's balls.

1240
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:25,689
So I know all the tricks.

1241
00:59:25,773 --> 00:59:27,358
You've either got a tack
in your shoe

1242
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:29,360
or you're clinching
your butt.

1243
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,196
I've got spikes
all over this thing.

1244
00:59:32,196 --> 00:59:35,366
If you do it again,

1245
00:59:35,449 --> 00:59:37,701
I'm going to void this test

1246
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:39,787
and report that you
were uncooperative.

1247
00:59:39,787 --> 00:59:41,121
Do you understand?

1248
00:59:41,205 --> 00:59:42,957
Yes, sir.

1249
00:59:45,876 --> 00:59:47,711
Walk with me.

1250
00:59:49,797 --> 00:59:51,131
We've got a problem, Jim.

1251
00:59:51,131 --> 00:59:52,550
With what?

1252
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,134
With your candor.

1253
00:59:54,134 --> 00:59:55,135
(knocking on door)

1254
00:59:55,219 --> 00:59:57,304
Come in.

1255
00:59:57,304 --> 00:59:58,389
He's here, sir.

1256
00:59:58,472 --> 01:00:00,140
Bring him in.

1257
01:00:02,059 --> 01:00:04,311
Jim, this is Mr. Hollenbeck,
our regional director.

1258
01:00:04,395 --> 01:00:05,312
Pleased to meet you, sir.

1259
01:00:05,396 --> 01:00:06,897
Have a seat.

1260
01:00:06,981 --> 01:00:08,482
Mr. Gillespie.

1261
01:00:08,566 --> 01:00:10,901
Pleased to meet you, sir.

1262
01:00:13,237 --> 01:00:15,573
Jim, uh...

1263
01:00:15,573 --> 01:00:16,824
you're an exemplary candidate

1264
01:00:16,907 --> 01:00:19,243
with valuable
operational experience.

1265
01:00:19,243 --> 01:00:22,913
You've cleared the psych
and physical hurdles.

1266
01:00:22,913 --> 01:00:25,666
Your credit's good,
you've kept your nose clean,

1267
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:27,168
you've got the Spanish.

1268
01:00:27,168 --> 01:00:28,502
You clearance is still valid.

1269
01:00:28,502 --> 01:00:29,920
Everybody we talked to
for background

1270
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,840
had only great things
to say about you.

1271
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,925
And then you scored a
negative-five on the polygraph.

1272
01:00:35,009 --> 01:00:39,263
That's indicative
of deception.

1273
01:00:39,263 --> 01:00:40,848
We were wondering why

1274
01:00:40,931 --> 01:00:43,684
until we got the results
of urinalysis.

1275
01:00:43,684 --> 01:00:47,438
We detected THC metabolites
in the urine, Jim.

1276
01:00:49,273 --> 01:00:52,276
Levels were just below
the positive threshold,

1277
01:00:52,359 --> 01:00:54,945
but there was a presence.

1278
01:00:54,945 --> 01:00:57,031
Do you have a drug
problem, Mr. Davis?

1279
01:00:57,114 --> 01:00:58,616
I don't have a
drug problem, sir.

1280
01:01:00,451 --> 01:01:02,953
I made a very
stupid mistake.

1281
01:01:03,037 --> 01:01:04,371
Would you care to tell us
the circumstances

1282
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:05,539
of your stupid mistake?

1283
01:01:05,539 --> 01:01:07,541
I was at a party...

1284
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:10,711
and someone offered me a joint.

1285
01:01:10,711 --> 01:01:14,465
I was pretty angry
about not getting into

1286
01:01:14,548 --> 01:01:18,469
the LAPD, so I was feeling
rebellious and, uh...

1287
01:01:21,472 --> 01:01:24,141
...I inhaled.

1288
01:01:24,225 --> 01:01:26,811
Someone considering a career
in law enforcement

1289
01:01:26,894 --> 01:01:28,395
would be well advised
to exercise

1290
01:01:28,479 --> 01:01:30,064
a little more discipline.

1291
01:01:30,064 --> 01:01:31,982
Yes, sir.

1292
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,320
I'm on the fence, Doug.

1293
01:01:36,403 --> 01:01:37,905
It's your call.

1294
01:01:37,905 --> 01:01:40,241
Mr. Davis, I'm in charge
of several programs.

1295
01:01:40,241 --> 01:01:42,243
Yes, sir?

1296
01:01:42,243 --> 01:01:45,162
Had a nice chat with your
old commanding officer.

1297
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:53,587
(speaks Korean)

1298
01:01:53,671 --> 01:01:55,422
Good.

1299
01:01:55,422 --> 01:01:56,757
Recognize these guys?

1300
01:02:00,344 --> 01:02:02,429
Huh?
Yeah,

1301
01:02:02,429 --> 01:02:03,430
they're your buddies.

1302
01:02:03,514 --> 01:02:05,015
Your old Hajji buddies.

1303
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:07,101
You should work in a deli
how you sliced these guys up.

1304
01:02:07,184 --> 01:02:08,185
RICHARDS:
Jesus Christ.

1305
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:09,687
Oh, I'm sorry.

1306
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:12,189
Did I ruin your lunch?

1307
01:02:12,273 --> 01:02:14,024
You went through
those sons of bitches

1308
01:02:14,108 --> 01:02:16,110
like butter.

1309
01:02:16,193 --> 01:02:17,695
I took my objective

1310
01:02:17,778 --> 01:02:19,280
and did what was necessary

1311
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,283
to obtain information
vital to national security

1312
01:02:22,366 --> 01:02:24,451
that saved
American lives.

1313
01:02:24,535 --> 01:02:26,370
Whacked them all,
huh, Jim?

1314
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:28,622
My C.O. told me not to leave
anything breathing.

1315
01:02:28,706 --> 01:02:30,541
- I do what I'm told.
- Relax, son.

1316
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:34,378
You were getting paid
to fuck people up.

1317
01:02:34,378 --> 01:02:36,046
You know we're beefing up
our anti-narcotics programs

1318
01:02:36,046 --> 01:02:38,549
in Latin America.

1319
01:02:38,632 --> 01:02:39,717
Yes, sir.

1320
01:02:39,717 --> 01:02:42,553
I had heard some things
on the grapevine.

1321
01:02:42,553 --> 01:02:44,221
I want you on my team.

1322
01:02:44,221 --> 01:02:46,056
I need someone who
can get things done

1323
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,892
on my task force
in Colombia.

1324
01:02:47,892 --> 01:02:50,311
Sir...

1325
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:52,980
I listed Los Angeles and
San Diego on my dream sheet.

1326
01:02:53,063 --> 01:02:54,815
No slots in southern California?

1327
01:02:54,815 --> 01:02:56,484
No, Jim.

1328
01:02:56,484 --> 01:02:57,485
I got Colombia.

1329
01:02:57,568 --> 01:02:59,403
That's what
I have for you.

1330
01:02:59,403 --> 01:03:01,405
If it's not
what you want,

1331
01:03:01,405 --> 01:03:02,406
thank you for your time.

1332
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:04,825
You can hit the door.

1333
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:09,497
What exactly would I be doing?

1334
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:12,082
Running and gunning
in the jungle?

1335
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:14,251
Mr. Davis,
this is the deal.

1336
01:03:14,251 --> 01:03:16,253
You'll be riding shotgun
with the locals

1337
01:03:16,253 --> 01:03:18,506
as interpreter-advisor
on sharp end operations.

1338
01:03:18,589 --> 01:03:20,007
You'll be in some
very hot areas.

1339
01:03:20,007 --> 01:03:21,842
How hot?

1340
01:03:21,842 --> 01:03:23,344
We talking trigger time?

1341
01:03:23,344 --> 01:03:24,678
Sure, if you want.

1342
01:03:24,678 --> 01:03:27,598
Well, who exactly
would I be working for?

1343
01:03:27,598 --> 01:03:29,767
The U.S. government, Jim.

1344
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:32,603
I want you in Glynco,
Georgia next week.

1345
01:03:32,603 --> 01:03:34,772
You make it through
in one piece,

1346
01:03:34,855 --> 01:03:38,359
you'll be working Colombia's
finest by the summer.

1347
01:03:38,359 --> 01:03:40,277
It's just that...

1348
01:03:40,277 --> 01:03:42,863
I'm supposed to get
married, sir.

1349
01:03:42,947 --> 01:03:44,949
Maybe now is not the time
to start a family.

1350
01:03:44,949 --> 01:03:46,617
We've been together a long time.

1351
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:49,036
I'm serious about marrying her.

1352
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,958
Foreign bride could jeopardize
your security clearance.

1353
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:58,796
Jim, don't shack up
with some Mexican.

1354
01:03:58,796 --> 01:04:02,216
Colombian broads are
smoking hot and knee deep.

1355
01:04:02,216 --> 01:04:04,468
You get a per diem
and a driver.

1356
01:04:04,552 --> 01:04:06,637
You'll live like
a fucking king down there.

1357
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,721
Yes, sir, I understand.

1358
01:04:07,721 --> 01:04:08,806
You take some time,

1359
01:04:08,806 --> 01:04:10,224
think about what
you want to do.

1360
01:04:10,307 --> 01:04:11,308
This is a serious
commitment.

1361
01:04:15,479 --> 01:04:18,899
I want the opportunity, sir.

1362
01:04:18,983 --> 01:04:20,901
I want on board.

1363
01:04:25,823 --> 01:04:27,324
Welcome aboard.

1364
01:04:27,324 --> 01:04:28,826
I'm taking a big
chance on you.

1365
01:04:28,909 --> 01:04:29,910
Thank you, sir.

1366
01:04:29,994 --> 01:04:31,579
This is the career
I've dreamed of.

1367
01:04:31,662 --> 01:04:32,997
These are your orders,

1368
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,498
orientation material
and travel money.

1369
01:04:34,582 --> 01:04:38,502
Report to FLETC before the end
of working hours Wednesday.

1370
01:04:38,502 --> 01:04:40,671
Thank you, sir.

1371
01:04:40,754 --> 01:04:41,839
God.

1372
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:02,026
Sorry, dog.

1373
01:05:07,865 --> 01:05:09,950
I got the job.

1374
01:05:11,118 --> 01:05:12,953
Oh, shit.

1375
01:05:13,037 --> 01:05:15,539
Yeah?

1376
01:05:15,623 --> 01:05:17,708
Me, too.

1377
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,296
- When do you start?
- Monday.

1378
01:05:22,379 --> 01:05:23,714
When do you start?

1379
01:05:23,714 --> 01:05:24,965
Wednesday.

1380
01:05:24,965 --> 01:05:28,385
Big Jim, back on
the man's payroll.

1381
01:05:28,469 --> 01:05:31,222
Got the W-2

1382
01:05:31,222 --> 01:05:34,475
and the employee handbook
as proof of employment.

1383
01:05:34,558 --> 01:05:37,561
I will be back in the
arms of my woman tonight.

1384
01:05:37,645 --> 01:05:40,815
Good.

1385
01:05:40,815 --> 01:05:43,234
Hey, we got to celebrate
this shit.

1386
01:05:44,235 --> 01:05:45,820
Salud.

1387
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:50,658
Oh, shit.

1388
01:05:54,662 --> 01:05:56,413
Fuzz.

1389
01:05:56,497 --> 01:05:58,332
They're on my ass, dog.

1390
01:05:58,332 --> 01:06:01,168
And my license is suspended.

1391
01:06:01,168 --> 01:06:03,003
Yeah, maybe he's
after someone else.

1392
01:06:03,003 --> 01:06:05,005
(siren honks)

1393
01:06:05,089 --> 01:06:07,258
Shit. Fucking shit, man.

1394
01:06:07,341 --> 01:06:09,510
He's pointing right at me.

1395
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:11,595
And we got the open beers.

1396
01:06:11,595 --> 01:06:14,515
Fuck the beers, the guns.

1397
01:06:14,598 --> 01:06:16,433
Shoot the fucker.

1398
01:06:16,433 --> 01:06:18,269
Car's in my name. We're fucked.

1399
01:06:18,269 --> 01:06:21,272
(siren blaring)

1400
01:06:21,272 --> 01:06:25,025
Shit. Right when shit
was starting to go good, dude,

1401
01:06:25,109 --> 01:06:26,110
I'm going to jail.

1402
01:06:26,193 --> 01:06:27,444
Damn it, I'm going to jail.

1403
01:06:29,697 --> 01:06:31,282
I can dump these guys.

1404
01:06:32,449 --> 01:06:34,535
Rip the video
from their trunk.

1405
01:06:40,207 --> 01:06:41,375
Let's see them hands.

1406
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:42,459
Let's see your hands

1407
01:06:42,459 --> 01:06:44,378
on the fucking dash!

1408
01:06:44,378 --> 01:06:47,381
Grab the sky or I'll blow
your fucking heads off.

1409
01:06:47,464 --> 01:06:49,633
Blink and die, scumbags.

1410
01:06:53,721 --> 01:06:55,389
Oh.

1411
01:06:55,473 --> 01:06:57,308
Look who it is, dude.

1412
01:06:57,391 --> 01:06:58,893
It's all right,
I know these guys.

1413
01:06:58,976 --> 01:07:00,978
You fucking asshole.

1414
01:07:01,061 --> 01:07:02,980
You're such a prick.
You scared the fuck out of me.

1415
01:07:03,063 --> 01:07:06,317
What's up, homie?

1416
01:07:06,317 --> 01:07:08,986
- What's up, fool?
- What's up, man.

1417
01:07:09,069 --> 01:07:11,572
I almost shot you, jerk.

1418
01:07:11,572 --> 01:07:13,073
That shit wasn't fucking
funny, Leo.

1419
01:07:13,157 --> 01:07:14,158
Yeah, it was hilarious.

1420
01:07:14,158 --> 01:07:16,911
You guys getting
fucked up?

1421
01:07:16,911 --> 01:07:20,247
Of course, dog, it's Friday.

1422
01:07:20,247 --> 01:07:22,583
Well, Boot,
you in the Academy yet?

1423
01:07:22,583 --> 01:07:24,585
Fuck no.

1424
01:07:24,668 --> 01:07:25,920
Fuck the LAPD.

1425
01:07:26,003 --> 01:07:28,506
It's local small-time bullshit.

1426
01:07:28,506 --> 01:07:29,590
I'm going with the feds.

1427
01:07:29,673 --> 01:07:30,758
How'd you get that hook-up, dog?

1428
01:07:30,758 --> 01:07:32,927
You know, me, got my
connects, you know.

1429
01:07:32,927 --> 01:07:34,011
Going to FLETC on Wednesday.

1430
01:07:34,094 --> 01:07:35,763
Hey, see you can
get me in there.

1431
01:07:35,763 --> 01:07:37,431
Yeah, I'll look into that.

1432
01:07:37,515 --> 01:07:39,266
How's Sylvia?

1433
01:07:39,266 --> 01:07:41,435
None of your concern,
ass wipe.

1434
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:43,854
Say hi to her for me, no?

1435
01:07:43,854 --> 01:07:45,189
No.

1436
01:07:45,272 --> 01:07:48,859
This vato's all protective
of his female.

1437
01:07:48,859 --> 01:07:51,028
Check this out.

1438
01:07:52,613 --> 01:07:53,614
Nice, huh?

1439
01:07:53,697 --> 01:07:56,200
It's a nine?
Uh-huh.

1440
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,035
Sorry, dog, I got
a lot of nines.

1441
01:07:58,118 --> 01:07:59,620
Come on, dude,
it's a bad-ass Ruger.

1442
01:07:59,703 --> 01:08:01,956
Talk to Toussaint.
He'll buy that shit.

1443
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:03,958
Toussaint, he's...
he's in Florida.

1444
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:06,460
He's back.
He called me today.

1445
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:10,881
Page me tonight, bro.

1446
01:08:10,965 --> 01:08:14,885
We'll hit the clubs and
tear up some fine hinas.

1447
01:08:14,885 --> 01:08:17,555
Later.
Sure, dog.

1448
01:08:17,638 --> 01:08:19,056
I'm on the City's time.

1449
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:21,809
You guys be cool.

1450
01:08:21,809 --> 01:08:23,811
Okay?

1451
01:08:28,232 --> 01:08:29,900
That fuck--
he put a scare in me.

1452
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,235
Yeah, me, too.

1453
01:08:31,235 --> 01:08:32,403
He's a dick.

1454
01:08:32,403 --> 01:08:34,155
Want to party with him?

1455
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,742
(hip-hop music playing)

1456
01:08:38,742 --> 01:08:41,245
See if this motherfucker's
home, dude.

1457
01:08:48,002 --> 01:08:52,840
Toussaint? Toussaint?!

1458
01:08:52,923 --> 01:08:54,008
Yo, Toussaint?

1459
01:08:54,008 --> 01:08:55,342
Yeah, come on, man.

1460
01:08:55,426 --> 01:08:59,263
Can't go far in that
little fucking place of yours.

1461
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,348
Goddammit,
I'm coming.

1462
01:09:01,432 --> 01:09:03,267
Chill out.

1463
01:09:03,267 --> 01:09:04,768
(laughing)

1464
01:09:04,768 --> 01:09:06,187
Washing that dirty ass.

1465
01:09:10,274 --> 01:09:12,276
Damn it.

1466
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:14,945
Group love. Group... Come on.

1467
01:09:15,029 --> 01:09:16,113
Group love, boys.

1468
01:09:16,197 --> 01:09:19,950
Welcome back, hometown.

1469
01:09:20,034 --> 01:09:23,454
Hey, I missed you
crazy fuckers, man.

1470
01:09:23,454 --> 01:09:24,955
Leo told us
you were back.

1471
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:27,208
Thanks for calling
asshole.

1472
01:09:31,629 --> 01:09:35,132
You a cop?

1473
01:09:35,132 --> 01:09:36,467
Uh-uh. Going federal.

1474
01:09:37,301 --> 01:09:38,302
(whistles)

1475
01:09:38,302 --> 01:09:40,638
Man, craziest head I know

1476
01:09:40,721 --> 01:09:41,806
is going

1477
01:09:41,889 --> 01:09:42,807
to be a fed.

1478
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:46,143
Yes, sir! Sir.

1479
01:09:46,143 --> 01:09:47,812
Still sponging off your woman?

1480
01:09:47,895 --> 01:09:50,314
Fuck you, dog. I got a job.

1481
01:09:50,314 --> 01:09:51,315
This motherfucker.

1482
01:09:51,398 --> 01:09:53,818
Look, dude.

1483
01:09:55,319 --> 01:09:57,321
This is bad.

1484
01:09:57,404 --> 01:09:59,907
It's yours for three
big ones, dog.

1485
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:03,911
Fuck yeah, I want it.

1486
01:10:03,994 --> 01:10:07,581
What's up?
What's up?

1487
01:10:07,665 --> 01:10:09,333
Huh?

1488
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:11,752
What the fuck you
say now, huh?

1489
01:10:11,836 --> 01:10:13,337
Hey. Huh?

1490
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:16,006
Bam, bam, bam.

1491
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:19,009
Motherfucker,
I'm strapped.

1492
01:10:19,093 --> 01:10:21,428
What the fuck
is up now, huh?

1493
01:10:21,512 --> 01:10:23,264
Whoo-ooh!

1494
01:10:23,264 --> 01:10:24,431
Whoa, whoa.

1495
01:10:24,515 --> 01:10:26,016
Your kneecap and shit.

1496
01:10:26,016 --> 01:10:30,437
Step up and get blasted.

1497
01:10:30,437 --> 01:10:34,441
Shit, man, what
the fuck is up now?

1498
01:10:34,441 --> 01:10:36,360
Hey, kick back, gunslinger.

1499
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,361
It's loaded.

1500
01:10:37,361 --> 01:10:38,696
That shit goes through walls.

1501
01:10:38,696 --> 01:10:39,864
You pop the neighbor's
little kids.

1502
01:10:39,947 --> 01:10:41,115
(cocks gun, bullets clinking)

1503
01:10:41,198 --> 01:10:42,366
Uh-oh.

1504
01:10:42,366 --> 01:10:43,701
Ooh.

1505
01:10:44,618 --> 01:10:47,538
Fuck, dude.

1506
01:10:47,538 --> 01:10:50,624
Whoa, I'm straight, bro.

1507
01:10:50,624 --> 01:10:54,879
Yo, guys, we got
to party tonight, you know?

1508
01:10:54,879 --> 01:10:56,714
Go clubbin' or something.

1509
01:10:56,714 --> 01:10:58,048
I got a better idea.

1510
01:10:58,048 --> 01:10:59,049
What?

1511
01:10:59,049 --> 01:11:00,050
Here, sir.

1512
01:11:02,052 --> 01:11:04,054
Let's go to Mexico.

1513
01:11:04,138 --> 01:11:05,723
Mexico?!

1514
01:11:05,723 --> 01:11:07,808
- Yeah.
- I'm in.

1515
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,645
(all talking)

1516
01:11:11,729 --> 01:11:13,564
Only fags like that...

1517
01:11:13,564 --> 01:11:15,566
Because you're a little faggot.

1518
01:11:15,566 --> 01:11:17,067
I don't get it,
too much fucking hills.

1519
01:11:17,067 --> 01:11:18,152
Right, right.

1520
01:11:18,235 --> 01:11:21,572
Dude, yo, dude, stay back boy,
stay back.

1521
01:11:21,572 --> 01:11:23,908
Motherfucker's got to ask
permission.

1522
01:11:23,991 --> 01:11:26,827
Fuck you, all right?

1523
01:11:26,911 --> 01:11:28,662
Let me tell
you something.

1524
01:11:28,662 --> 01:11:30,664
I am a grown motherfucking man,
all right?

1525
01:11:30,748 --> 01:11:32,416
I'm going to tell her
the good news,

1526
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,752
make up, grab my shit
and we are out.

1527
01:11:34,835 --> 01:11:37,254
REPORTER:
Lines, lines, and more lines.

1528
01:11:37,254 --> 01:11:39,590
For many passengers
traveling through LAX,

1529
01:11:39,673 --> 01:11:41,759
the waiting has become
unbearable.

1530
01:11:41,759 --> 01:11:43,260
It's hit or miss,
you can't predict it...

1531
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:46,263
Excuse me, you're not
made out of glass.

1532
01:11:46,263 --> 01:11:47,264
I'm made out of me.

1533
01:11:47,264 --> 01:11:49,934
You're drunk.

1534
01:11:49,934 --> 01:11:51,435
I'm celebrating, baby.

1535
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:52,853
What, another wasted day?

1536
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:56,357
Here.

1537
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,776
...security since 9-11,
but that's true everywhere.

1538
01:11:58,776 --> 01:12:01,946
...and still a recent study shows
the wait at LAX

1539
01:12:01,987 --> 01:12:03,531
is the third longest
in the world...

1540
01:12:07,284 --> 01:12:08,702
This is a good company.

1541
01:12:08,744 --> 01:12:10,913
They make all
the new condos downtown.

1542
01:12:10,955 --> 01:12:11,914
How much?

1543
01:12:11,956 --> 01:12:12,998
$12 an hour.

1544
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:13,999
Plus their MIS guy

1545
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:15,209
is leaving in three months.

1546
01:12:15,292 --> 01:12:17,044
I'm going to update
my certifications

1547
01:12:17,086 --> 01:12:18,295
and take his job over.

1548
01:12:18,295 --> 01:12:19,463
Then I'll make bank.

1549
01:12:22,967 --> 01:12:24,718
Such an asshole.

1550
01:12:24,802 --> 01:12:26,720
What? Why?
This shit is real.

1551
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,722
This is a great job,
the pay is outstanding

1552
01:12:28,722 --> 01:12:31,642
and it's a great opportunity
for me to do what I want to do.

1553
01:12:31,684 --> 01:12:33,394
I know.

1554
01:12:33,477 --> 01:12:36,564
It's so... it's so Mike,
you know.

1555
01:12:36,647 --> 01:12:38,816
You can't just go out
and get a shitty job.

1556
01:12:38,899 --> 01:12:40,317
You gotta... you gotta get a...

1557
01:12:40,317 --> 01:12:41,318
A dream job?

1558
01:12:41,318 --> 01:12:42,653
Yeah, a dream job.

1559
01:12:42,695 --> 01:12:45,656
Well, why shouldn't your
dream guy have a dream job?

1560
01:12:45,656 --> 01:12:47,658
...the ambitious plans
of many opponents

1561
01:12:47,741 --> 01:12:50,661
on the County Board
of Supervisors...

1562
01:12:56,333 --> 01:12:58,085
(chuckles)

1563
01:12:58,169 --> 01:13:00,504
Come here, I have a job for you.

1564
01:13:04,758 --> 01:13:08,596
# Da-da-da-da, doo-rup #

1565
01:13:08,596 --> 01:13:11,932
# Da-da-da-da.
doo-rup. #

1566
01:13:12,016 --> 01:13:14,101
What the fuck
is taking so long?

1567
01:13:14,185 --> 01:13:15,686
I knew this
shit would happen.

1568
01:13:15,686 --> 01:13:17,021
She hates my ass.

1569
01:13:17,062 --> 01:13:19,356
She's not going
to let him go.

1570
01:13:19,356 --> 01:13:21,192
Go knock.

1571
01:13:22,818 --> 01:13:25,404
Dude, go knock.

1572
01:13:25,446 --> 01:13:29,867
Bro, drag his fucking
ass out of there.

1573
01:13:32,703 --> 01:13:34,330
(chuckles)

1574
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:38,542
Yo, Miguel.

1575
01:13:41,045 --> 01:13:43,547
Hey.

1576
01:13:43,547 --> 01:13:46,467
Mike, hurry up.

1577
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:48,135
(door opening)

1578
01:13:48,219 --> 01:13:49,553
Hey.

1579
01:13:49,553 --> 01:13:51,388
Yo, what the fuck
are you doing?

1580
01:13:51,472 --> 01:13:52,807
Come on, dude.

1581
01:13:52,807 --> 01:13:54,892
Dog, I'm tearin'
it up, man.

1582
01:13:54,975 --> 01:13:57,269
I'm hittin' it, bro.
It's been a few days.

1583
01:13:57,311 --> 01:13:59,980
You guys just go ahead, man.
I'm gonna chill.

1584
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:01,398
What?

1585
01:14:01,398 --> 01:14:03,901
I'm just gonna kick it here
with the woman.

1586
01:14:03,901 --> 01:14:06,570
You said you'd go, man.

1587
01:14:06,612 --> 01:14:08,197
Your woman's in your head.

1588
01:14:08,197 --> 01:14:09,240
That's wrong.

1589
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,574
She's got your nuts, bro.

1590
01:14:10,574 --> 01:14:12,493
Dog, dog...

1591
01:14:12,576 --> 01:14:15,496
Sylvia's all happy 'cause I
got a job, all right, dude?

1592
01:14:15,538 --> 01:14:17,414
She wants us to
fuckin' chill together.

1593
01:14:17,414 --> 01:14:21,001
Man, that girl put
the zap on your head.

1594
01:14:21,085 --> 01:14:22,670
This is our last
chance to hang.

1595
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:26,006
- You're like my brother.
- Yeah.

1596
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:27,675
You're all I got.
You're gonna dog me like that?

1597
01:14:27,758 --> 01:14:29,051
I ain't no fucking do...

1598
01:14:29,093 --> 01:14:31,262
How are you, baby?

1599
01:14:31,262 --> 01:14:33,430
Hey, Sylvia, he's
going to Mexico.

1600
01:14:33,514 --> 01:14:36,809
No, he isn't, Jim.
Yes, he is.

1601
01:14:36,851 --> 01:14:40,855
I'm joining the feds. I'm gone,
I'm out of here next week.

1602
01:14:40,855 --> 01:14:42,439
The least
you can do

1603
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:43,858
is let my best friend

1604
01:14:43,858 --> 01:14:45,192
see me off.

1605
01:14:45,192 --> 01:14:46,360
Baby, it's not safe.

1606
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,820
All you're going
to do is drink.

1607
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:49,864
Aw, fuck, man.

1608
01:14:49,905 --> 01:14:51,615
Mike, come on.

1609
01:14:51,615 --> 01:14:53,492
Come on, fuck, man!

1610
01:14:53,534 --> 01:14:55,286
Come on,
you promised.

1611
01:14:55,369 --> 01:14:56,871
You promised, man.

1612
01:14:56,954 --> 01:15:02,042
Yo... I promised,
Sylvia, okay?

1613
01:15:02,126 --> 01:15:03,961
Mike, you're not
going to Mexico.

1614
01:15:04,003 --> 01:15:05,713
What?

1615
01:15:05,796 --> 01:15:07,298
You're not going.

1616
01:15:07,298 --> 01:15:10,467
I'm not your fucking
puppet, Sylvia.

1617
01:15:10,467 --> 01:15:12,845
All right, you know what,
do what you want.

1618
01:15:12,887 --> 01:15:15,139
But I'm not going to be
here when you get back.

1619
01:15:15,222 --> 01:15:16,390
That's fucked up.

1620
01:15:16,432 --> 01:15:18,392
Why you got to lay
that bullshit on him?

1621
01:15:18,476 --> 01:15:20,311
Because I don't want him
going with you, Jim.

1622
01:15:20,394 --> 01:15:22,396
You're fucking nuts.

1623
01:15:22,396 --> 01:15:24,648
You're crazy
and you're dangerous,

1624
01:15:24,732 --> 01:15:26,650
and my biggest nightmare
is you with a fucking badge.

1625
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:28,152
You're the last person
who should have one.

1626
01:15:28,152 --> 01:15:29,153
Yeah?
Yeah.

1627
01:15:29,153 --> 01:15:30,321
That's not bullshit,
it's the truth.

1628
01:15:30,321 --> 01:15:31,614
Fuck this!

1629
01:15:31,655 --> 01:15:32,740
Whoa, wait.

1630
01:15:32,823 --> 01:15:34,241
Whatever, man.

1631
01:15:34,325 --> 01:15:36,827
Fuckin' thanks, homie!

1632
01:15:36,827 --> 01:15:37,912
Yeah, laters.

1633
01:15:37,995 --> 01:15:40,331
Bye.

1634
01:15:40,414 --> 01:15:41,749
Yo, yo.

1635
01:15:41,749 --> 01:15:43,083
I'm going.

1636
01:15:44,502 --> 01:15:45,503
I gotta go.

1637
01:15:45,503 --> 01:15:47,171
Get the fuck out
of here, go!

1638
01:15:48,506 --> 01:15:49,256
Go!

1639
01:15:49,298 --> 01:15:51,008
Fuck this shit, man.

1640
01:15:51,091 --> 01:15:52,343
Good night, Sylvia.

1641
01:15:52,426 --> 01:15:53,511
Kiss my ass, Jim.

1642
01:15:53,511 --> 01:15:55,554
Oh, any time, sellout.

1643
01:15:55,596 --> 01:15:58,224
Oh, you going to be happy
once he's dead? Huh?

1644
01:16:07,191 --> 01:16:08,526
Hey, Toussaint.

1645
01:16:08,526 --> 01:16:10,194
I heard the battle, man.

1646
01:16:10,236 --> 01:16:12,530
Yo, your lady didn't
want you going, huh?

1647
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:14,031
No, but I'm going.

1648
01:16:14,031 --> 01:16:15,533
- Hell, yeah.
- Shit.

1649
01:16:15,616 --> 01:16:17,117
- I'm a motherfucking man.
- That's right.

1650
01:16:17,201 --> 01:16:19,203
Shit. I walk
the Earth at will.

1651
01:16:19,286 --> 01:16:21,163
- Damn right.
- I do whatever the fuck I want.

1652
01:16:21,205 --> 01:16:22,206
You know, we're men, right?

1653
01:16:22,289 --> 01:16:23,457
- We're men, right?
- That's right.

1654
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:24,792
That's what we do, right?

1655
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:26,460
Amen. And don't worry--

1656
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,712
home girl will be right there
waiting when you get back.

1657
01:16:28,712 --> 01:16:29,880
You're right. You're right.

1658
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,090
She wouldn't play
that shit like that.

1659
01:16:31,131 --> 01:16:32,550
Shit, I got a fucking job
for real.

1660
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:33,467
You did.

1661
01:16:33,467 --> 01:16:34,969
Plus you're my homie, dog.
You're my homie.

1662
01:16:35,136 --> 01:16:36,637
You're going to go fucking
do your thing

1663
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,472
- and this is it.
- No, shit, dude.

1664
01:16:38,556 --> 01:16:39,557
Yo, we're all dogs.

1665
01:16:39,557 --> 01:16:40,891
I got you guys
back, man.

1666
01:16:40,933 --> 01:16:41,976
No doubt,
no doubt.

1667
01:16:42,143 --> 01:16:43,727
It's just going to be
fucking cool, yo.

1668
01:16:43,811 --> 01:16:45,479
I got a job,
you got a job.

1669
01:16:45,563 --> 01:16:46,981
Shit, I got some bud.

1670
01:16:47,148 --> 01:16:48,399
- We got some smokes.
- We got some

1671
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:50,151
- motherfucking money.
- We are on a mission.

1672
01:16:50,151 --> 01:16:53,154
Let's get our heads together
so we can achieve our objective

1673
01:16:53,154 --> 01:16:54,321
in a timely manner.

1674
01:16:54,321 --> 01:16:56,907
Let's get deployed, people.

1675
01:16:56,991 --> 01:16:58,159
(all yelling)

1676
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,494
(Native American war chant)

1677
01:17:11,922 --> 01:17:15,426
##

1678
01:17:22,141 --> 01:17:24,226
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

1679
01:17:24,226 --> 01:17:25,352
Rise and fucking shine.

1680
01:17:25,436 --> 01:17:27,897
Come on, ladies.
Chow time.

1681
01:17:27,938 --> 01:17:29,106
Chow's getting cold.

1682
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:32,193
MIKE: Oh, what the fuck, Jim?
Chill, dude.

1683
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:49,293
Dude, where are we?

1684
01:17:49,376 --> 01:17:52,338
Family, man.

1685
01:17:52,379 --> 01:17:53,923
Damn!
It's a shizzack...

1686
01:17:53,964 --> 01:17:54,965
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1687
01:17:54,965 --> 01:17:57,468
It's a home, all right?

1688
01:17:57,468 --> 01:17:59,678
Respect, bro.

1689
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,555
Straighten up, fellas.

1690
01:18:04,975 --> 01:18:06,894
My old lady, Marta.

1691
01:18:06,936 --> 01:18:07,895
Hola.

1692
01:18:07,895 --> 01:18:09,063
Mike.
Hola, mucho gusto.

1693
01:18:09,104 --> 01:18:10,606
Hola, Mike.
Toussaint.

1694
01:18:10,606 --> 01:18:12,066
Hola. Hola. Hola.

1695
01:18:12,149 --> 01:18:13,734
Hola. Marisa.

1696
01:18:13,734 --> 01:18:14,819
Buenos dias. Mi mama.

1697
01:18:14,902 --> 01:18:15,820
Mucho gusto. Marta's mom.

1698
01:18:15,861 --> 01:18:17,822
Buenos dias.

1699
01:18:17,863 --> 01:18:19,156
Vicki.
Vicki.

1700
01:18:19,156 --> 01:18:21,075
La prima, esa es mi prima.

1701
01:18:21,158 --> 01:18:22,243
Mucho gusto.

1702
01:18:22,326 --> 01:18:23,494
Mucho gusto. Mike. Vicki.

1703
01:18:23,494 --> 01:18:25,204
Toussaint.

1704
01:18:25,246 --> 01:18:26,413
Vicki.

1705
01:18:26,497 --> 01:18:27,915
Okay.
(chuckles)

1706
01:18:27,998 --> 01:18:29,500
Hey, grab yourselves a rock.

1707
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,252
Sí, por favor, sientense.

1708
01:18:32,253 --> 01:18:33,546
(dog barks in distance)

1709
01:18:33,587 --> 01:18:34,588
MARTA:
Vicki?

1710
01:18:34,588 --> 01:18:36,257
¿Café, quieren café?

1711
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:38,259
Sí, café, por favor.
Vicki, andale.

1712
01:18:38,259 --> 01:18:40,511
Tranquila, baby.

1713
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:43,180
(laughs)

1714
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:44,682
¡Mama!

1715
01:18:44,765 --> 01:18:46,851
Yeah, w-what's
she saying, dude?

1716
01:18:46,934 --> 01:18:48,936
Oh, they... they
think you're cool.

1717
01:18:49,019 --> 01:18:50,104
Oh, sweet.

1718
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:54,275
Aquí tienes. Gracias.

1719
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:56,610
- Caliente.
- (whispers): Thank you.

1720
01:19:00,447 --> 01:19:01,657
Dude...

1721
01:19:01,699 --> 01:19:03,117
Marta's fine as fuck, bro.

1722
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,326
Hey, hey, hey...

1723
01:19:04,368 --> 01:19:06,412
I'm just saying, dude.
You need to marry her, bro.

1724
01:19:06,453 --> 01:19:08,789
If you don't,
you're a fool.

1725
01:19:08,873 --> 01:19:10,958
¿Que dice?

1726
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:13,961
Oh...

1727
01:19:13,961 --> 01:19:16,046
- Oh, that shit's good, man.
- (Spanish rock song plays)

1728
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:18,632
No shit, you know they got that
good fucking weed from here.

1729
01:19:18,632 --> 01:19:21,552
That's what I want.
Some of that good shit.

1730
01:19:21,635 --> 01:19:23,971
You know where some fields
are or something, Jim?

1731
01:19:24,096 --> 01:19:26,557
Yeah, that's not... I want to
see, like, where they grow it.

1732
01:19:26,557 --> 01:19:27,725
You know, and then maybe

1733
01:19:27,766 --> 01:19:29,852
they'll let us go out
and, like, pick some.

1734
01:19:29,852 --> 01:19:31,979
You know, pick some of
that really good weed.

1735
01:19:32,062 --> 01:19:36,108
##

1736
01:19:41,489 --> 01:19:42,573
(sighs)

1737
01:19:42,656 --> 01:19:43,824
Shit.

1738
01:19:43,908 --> 01:19:47,495
(cawing)

1739
01:19:49,246 --> 01:19:50,247
MIKE:
Toussaint?

1740
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:55,002
(chuckles)

1741
01:19:55,085 --> 01:19:57,087
This is nice.

1742
01:19:57,171 --> 01:19:59,423
This is beautiful, man.

1743
01:19:59,507 --> 01:20:00,591
Dog, you see this?

1744
01:20:00,633 --> 01:20:02,927
Here.

1745
01:20:04,303 --> 01:20:05,304
Mmm...

1746
01:20:05,346 --> 01:20:06,514
Beautiful...

1747
01:20:06,514 --> 01:20:07,765
Man!

1748
01:20:07,848 --> 01:20:09,266
Mmm!

1749
01:20:09,266 --> 01:20:11,352
When the hell'd you get
all the pistos, dog?

1750
01:20:11,435 --> 01:20:12,645
Mexico, man.

1751
01:20:12,686 --> 01:20:13,687
It's magic.

1752
01:20:13,771 --> 01:20:15,022
(chuckles)

1753
01:20:15,105 --> 01:20:17,942
(cawing)

1754
01:20:17,942 --> 01:20:19,026
TOUSSAINT:
He bleed?

1755
01:20:19,109 --> 01:20:20,027
JIM:
Like a stuffed pig.

1756
01:20:20,110 --> 01:20:21,195
(Toussaint sighs)

1757
01:20:21,195 --> 01:20:23,030
How'd Letty know you were
tearing up her sister?

1758
01:20:23,072 --> 01:20:25,616
That fuckin' bitch Patti, right?

1759
01:20:25,658 --> 01:20:27,284
- Ah...
- I took her to dinner.

1760
01:20:27,368 --> 01:20:29,620
Took her for a cruise
up to Malibu, you know?

1761
01:20:29,703 --> 01:20:32,373
Got up all in it.
Back of my ride...

1762
01:20:32,414 --> 01:20:34,041
Pounded that fish, man.

1763
01:20:34,124 --> 01:20:35,459
Good fuckin' fish.

1764
01:20:35,501 --> 01:20:36,585
I figured the crazy broad

1765
01:20:36,627 --> 01:20:37,962
pulled out some hairs and pubes

1766
01:20:37,962 --> 01:20:39,713
and stashed it in the seat,
you know?

1767
01:20:39,713 --> 01:20:42,341
Oh, dude, you got to watch that
shit, man.

1768
01:20:42,341 --> 01:20:44,635
Chicks get treacherous.

1769
01:20:44,718 --> 01:20:47,304
Yeah, no shit.
Sibling rivalry, Jim.

1770
01:20:47,304 --> 01:20:48,722
(chuckles):
Next day,

1771
01:20:48,722 --> 01:20:51,183
I'm driving around with Letty
all kick back and shit,

1772
01:20:51,183 --> 01:20:54,562
and she radars in
on this rat's nest, man.

1773
01:20:54,645 --> 01:20:57,398
Pulls out these long-ass hairs,
she's like "What are these?"

1774
01:20:57,439 --> 01:20:58,399
"Whose are these?"

1775
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:59,900
(cackling)

1776
01:20:59,984 --> 01:21:02,987
She sees all the pubes mixed in,
man... fuckin' busted.

1777
01:21:03,154 --> 01:21:04,989
Busted!
(singsong voice): Busted!

1778
01:21:05,156 --> 01:21:06,323
Oh!

1779
01:21:06,323 --> 01:21:08,659
Dude, how'd she know
they were her sister's?

1780
01:21:08,742 --> 01:21:10,161
Oh, come on, dude.

1781
01:21:10,244 --> 01:21:11,745
Mexican chick voodoo,
right, Mike?

1782
01:21:11,829 --> 01:21:13,330
You know,
live and learn.

1783
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:15,833
Yep, next time you'll be all up
in your ride

1784
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:17,668
with the Super
Vac, dude.
Treachery!

1785
01:21:17,751 --> 01:21:19,753
Yep, treachery.

1786
01:21:19,837 --> 01:21:21,422
(dog barking in distance)

1787
01:21:21,463 --> 01:21:22,464
(horse snorts)

1788
01:21:25,759 --> 01:21:27,845
Um...

1789
01:21:27,845 --> 01:21:29,597
shouldn't we be

1790
01:21:29,597 --> 01:21:30,806
helping them?

1791
01:21:30,848 --> 01:21:32,349
You know how to hand wash?

1792
01:21:32,391 --> 01:21:33,934
- No.
- Then don't sweat it.

1793
01:21:33,976 --> 01:21:35,019
Yeah, we're men.

1794
01:21:35,186 --> 01:21:36,604
They know we don't do that shit.

1795
01:21:36,687 --> 01:21:37,605
That's right.

1796
01:21:37,646 --> 01:21:39,023
We're men.

1797
01:21:39,023 --> 01:21:40,858
(chuckling)

1798
01:21:40,858 --> 01:21:42,193
Oh, yeah!

1799
01:21:43,861 --> 01:21:45,404
(sighs)

1800
01:21:45,404 --> 01:21:46,614
This is paradise, huh?

1801
01:21:46,697 --> 01:21:48,032
Mm-hmm.

1802
01:21:49,867 --> 01:21:51,452
Yo, Mike?

1803
01:21:51,535 --> 01:21:52,953
Yeah?

1804
01:21:53,037 --> 01:21:54,246
They're sending me to Colombia.

1805
01:21:59,877 --> 01:22:02,630
Colombia.

1806
01:22:02,671 --> 01:22:04,298
Who, the man?

1807
01:22:04,381 --> 01:22:06,258
Yep.

1808
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,469
They're tearing shit up down
there, they need my help.

1809
01:22:08,552 --> 01:22:10,387
Doing what?

1810
01:22:10,387 --> 01:22:12,306
Busting up drug labs
and drug lords

1811
01:22:12,306 --> 01:22:13,974
- and all that shit.
- You got it.

1812
01:22:14,058 --> 01:22:16,477
Gonna be an advisor, you know--
shoot him, him and him.

1813
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,646
Then it's back to the barracks
for bitches and beer.

1814
01:22:18,729 --> 01:22:20,564
I'm set.

1815
01:22:20,564 --> 01:22:22,733
Why do you want to do
that shit, dude?

1816
01:22:22,733 --> 01:22:24,318
I mean...

1817
01:22:24,401 --> 01:22:27,696
what about Marta, you know?

1818
01:22:27,738 --> 01:22:28,739
I mean...

1819
01:22:28,823 --> 01:22:30,741
Ain't gonna happen.

1820
01:22:30,783 --> 01:22:33,244
They told me not to get married.

1821
01:22:33,244 --> 01:22:35,162
TOUSSAINT:
That's messed.

1822
01:22:35,246 --> 01:22:36,247
They really told you that?

1823
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,040
Not straight up,
but I heard 'em.

1824
01:22:38,082 --> 01:22:40,918
Yo, if the feds won't let you
hook up with your old lady,

1825
01:22:40,918 --> 01:22:42,586
you need to tell them
to fuck off.

1826
01:22:42,670 --> 01:22:44,088
Yeah, I mean,

1827
01:22:44,088 --> 01:22:46,757
you love her,
she loves you, right?

1828
01:22:46,841 --> 01:22:49,426
Dude, you need to move
down here, marry Marta,

1829
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:50,928
you know, get a good-ass job

1830
01:22:51,011 --> 01:22:53,597
working with fucking
tourists or something.

1831
01:22:53,597 --> 01:22:55,015
Fuck that.

1832
01:22:55,015 --> 01:22:57,309
Taking bucket baths
in cold-ass water?

1833
01:22:57,351 --> 01:22:59,186
You know, wading around
in ankle-deep mud?

1834
01:22:59,186 --> 01:23:00,187
Outhouses, man!

1835
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:02,189
Fuckin' outhouses!

1836
01:23:02,273 --> 01:23:04,275
You told Marta yet?

1837
01:23:08,195 --> 01:23:09,822
You love this place.

1838
01:23:09,864 --> 01:23:13,117
It's in your eyes, man.

1839
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,619
Dude, this is
what it's all about.

1840
01:23:15,619 --> 01:23:19,874
You got a woman that loves
you and a place to stay.

1841
01:23:19,957 --> 01:23:21,542
You'd be happy here,
and you know it.

1842
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:25,880
Yeah, well,
shacking up with Marta,

1843
01:23:25,963 --> 01:23:31,051
squeezing out some puppies,
has its appeal, but...

1844
01:23:31,135 --> 01:23:34,388
this is my career.

1845
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:36,432
I got one shot.

1846
01:23:36,474 --> 01:23:38,017
You're making
a mistake.

1847
01:23:38,142 --> 01:23:42,813
You should stay right
here with your lady.

1848
01:23:42,897 --> 01:23:44,273
What the fuck you gonna do

1849
01:23:44,273 --> 01:23:46,150
in Colombia?

1850
01:23:48,402 --> 01:23:50,321
Whack people,

1851
01:23:50,321 --> 01:23:51,572
program shit.

1852
01:23:51,614 --> 01:23:54,241
You ain't down, fuck you.

1853
01:23:54,325 --> 01:23:56,160
Bring in my gunships

1854
01:23:56,243 --> 01:23:59,246
and smoke your little jungle
hideaway. You know?

1855
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:00,956
I mean, I'm a solider
of the apocalypse, man.

1856
01:24:00,956 --> 01:24:02,166
I'll be in a chopper,

1857
01:24:02,249 --> 01:24:05,920
door-gunning villagers
and shit. Fuck 'em.

1858
01:24:06,003 --> 01:24:08,797
Kill the chickens
and dogs, too, man.

1859
01:24:08,839 --> 01:24:10,174
(can clatters)

1860
01:24:10,174 --> 01:24:12,676
I don't give a fuck.

Yeah.

MIKE:
Doce años.

1873
01:26:18,969 --> 01:26:20,554
- Doce años.
- JIM: Doce años...

1874
01:26:20,554 --> 01:26:22,765
Doce... we've been
together that long.

1875
01:26:22,807 --> 01:26:24,058
Es muy bonita.

1876
01:26:24,141 --> 01:26:25,434
Man, you're bring sand
to the beach, dumb ass.

1877
01:26:25,476 --> 01:26:27,728
- Cover that shit up.
- TOUSSAINT: Jim, dude!

1878
01:26:27,728 --> 01:26:28,896
Huh?

1879
01:26:28,979 --> 01:26:31,398
How you say, um, "You're
beautiful" in Spanish?

1880
01:26:31,398 --> 01:26:32,983
Huh? "Bonita."
Bonita.

Come on, you don't know
that shit, Toussaint?

1883
01:26:37,655 --> 01:26:39,448
Tu... bonita.

1884
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:40,574
VICKI:
Gracias.

1885
01:26:40,658 --> 01:26:42,117
MIKE:
Hey, baby, see my new one?

1886
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:43,494
- Right, did I get it?
- Huh?

1887
01:26:43,494 --> 01:26:44,745
Think I got it?

1888
01:26:44,829 --> 01:26:47,915
Yeah, she got the point.

1889
01:26:51,085 --> 01:26:54,505
Yo, Mike, that chick digs you.

1890
01:26:54,547 --> 01:26:56,340
What chick?

1891
01:26:57,925 --> 01:26:59,927
MIKE:
Oh, she's good, dog.

1892
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:02,179
Yeah, name's Lila.

1893
01:27:02,179 --> 01:27:04,265
She's a freak.
She'll fuck you, dude.

1894

(laughs)

1895
01:27:05,766 --> 01:27:07,518
She's a freak, huh?

1896
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,186
How you know? You fuck her?

1897
01:27:09,228 --> 01:27:11,272
No, out of respect
for Marta.

1898
01:27:11,313 --> 01:27:14,441
Not that I don't want...
Hey, baby.

1899
01:27:14,525 --> 01:27:17,987
Ask her to dance.

1900
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:20,156
I'm not cheating
on Sylvia, dude.

(song ends,
partygoers applaud)

1902
01:27:21,949 --> 01:27:25,202
There's a big gap between
dancing and fucking, man.

1903
01:27:25,202 --> 01:27:27,121
Go explore it.

1904
01:27:28,289 --> 01:27:29,957
No shit.

1905
01:27:29,999 --> 01:27:32,376

You're fucking nuts.

1914
01:31:40,457 --> 01:31:42,626
You fucked up, woman.

1915
01:31:44,295 --> 01:31:46,297
I'll do it.

Where's Toussaint?

He's dancing.

- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1926

- You gonna get back

1927
01:32:45,189 --> 01:32:46,357
to the party?
- Yeah.

1928

Let's get back
to the party, man.

1929

go tell Toussaint that

1931

we're gonna get the
fuck out of here, man.

Just go into the party,

I'm having a
great time, bro.

1943

Fucked up!

1953
01:33:50,254 --> 01:33:52,089
(crying)

1954
01:33:53,174 --> 01:33:55,593
(transmission revving,
tires squealing)

1955
01:34:07,605 --> 01:34:09,607
(tires squealing)

1956
01:34:13,861 --> 01:34:17,281
Dude, dude... dude, slow down.

1957
01:34:17,364 --> 01:34:20,618
(tires squealing)

1958
01:34:20,701 --> 01:34:22,203
Fuck, man.

1959
01:34:22,286 --> 01:34:25,873
Whoo, yeah, man.

1960
01:34:25,873 --> 01:34:27,541
Slow down,
you crazy motherfucker!

1961
01:34:27,541 --> 01:34:30,294
I want a cop to pull me over.

1962
01:34:31,879 --> 01:34:34,131
JIM:
Treachery.

1963
01:34:34,131 --> 01:34:36,050
Fucking treachery.

1964
01:34:36,050 --> 01:34:38,385
Jim, slow down!

1965
01:34:38,385 --> 01:34:39,553
Shut up!

1966
01:34:40,721 --> 01:34:42,139
Fuck, dude.

1967
01:34:42,890 --> 01:34:45,142
Only female I trust.

1968
01:34:45,142 --> 01:34:47,228
(transmission revs,
tire squeal)

1969
01:34:47,228 --> 01:34:49,063
Fuck you, God!

1970
01:34:49,146 --> 01:34:52,650
You ain't got the fucking balls
to take my ass.

1971
01:34:54,235 --> 01:34:57,738
Jim, don't say that shit, dude.

1972
01:35:12,837 --> 01:35:14,004
Jim!

1973
01:35:14,004 --> 01:35:15,005
(brakes screeching)

1974
01:35:17,007 --> 01:35:20,594
Dude, you are getting
out of control, okay?

1975
01:35:20,678 --> 01:35:23,180
You need psychiatric
help, man.

1976
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:26,517
You're seriously
fucked up, dude.

1977
01:35:26,517 --> 01:35:32,022
All right, you need to sue
the military or something.

1978
01:35:32,022 --> 01:35:33,774
You used to be mellow.

1979
01:35:37,111 --> 01:35:38,362
Later, homie.

1980
01:35:38,445 --> 01:35:40,197
'Night, dog.

1981
01:35:40,197 --> 01:35:42,449
Laters.

1982
01:35:42,449 --> 01:35:44,451
Dude, I ain't hanging
around you anymore

1983
01:35:44,451 --> 01:35:45,786
until you get
some fucking help.

1984
01:35:45,786 --> 01:35:48,539
You can 12-step off, bitch.

1985
01:35:48,539 --> 01:35:50,875
You're dismissed.

1986
01:36:03,637 --> 01:36:05,389
He's right, dude.

1987
01:36:05,473 --> 01:36:06,474
Yeah.

1988
01:36:09,393 --> 01:36:11,896
Georgia will get me
squared away.

1989
01:36:11,979 --> 01:36:14,815
Hope so.

1990
01:36:14,815 --> 01:36:18,319
What was that shit
with Marta, dude?

1991
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:23,073
I don't know why that happened.

1992
01:36:25,242 --> 01:36:27,328
But I'm cool.
I'm cool now.

1993
01:36:27,411 --> 01:36:29,246
Okay?

1994
01:36:31,165 --> 01:36:32,166
Yeah.

1995
01:36:32,166 --> 01:36:33,834
I'm cool.

1996
01:36:44,929 --> 01:36:47,264
Look, dude, she told me
she was pregnant.

1997
01:36:47,264 --> 01:36:49,016
I had a panic attack.

1998
01:36:49,099 --> 01:36:50,184
I pulled my gun.

1999
01:36:50,184 --> 01:36:51,435
Come on, dog,

2000
01:36:51,435 --> 01:36:53,187
I thought you loved her, dude.

2001
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:55,773
I do.

2002
01:36:55,773 --> 01:36:57,858
God, fuck.

2003
01:36:57,858 --> 01:37:00,611
Come on, man, let's
go drop off that bud.

2004
01:37:04,031 --> 01:37:05,282
What bud?

2005
01:37:05,366 --> 01:37:08,202
There's 20 kilos in the trunk.

2006
01:37:08,202 --> 01:37:09,537
Say that again?

2007
01:37:09,537 --> 01:37:11,705
There's 20 kilos
in the trunk, man.

2008
01:37:11,789 --> 01:37:13,290
(laughing)

2009
01:37:13,290 --> 01:37:14,625
- Of weed?
- Yeah.

2010
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:15,960
Get the fuck out of here, man.

2011
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:17,461
I picked it up at the party.

2012
01:37:17,461 --> 01:37:19,797
I'm dropping it at Casper's.

2013
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:21,465
Casper's?

2014
01:37:21,549 --> 01:37:23,300
(laughing):
I get three Gs.

2015
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:26,387
We get three Gs.

2016
01:37:26,387 --> 01:37:27,972
You drove it across the border?

2017
01:37:28,055 --> 01:37:30,141
(laughing):
Yeah.

2018
01:37:30,141 --> 01:37:31,475
What if they would've caught us?

2019
01:37:31,475 --> 01:37:33,310
Couldn't happen, man.

2020
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:36,897
My shit is on fire
right now, man.

2021
01:37:36,981 --> 01:37:39,567
My shit is wired
right now, man.

2022
01:37:39,650 --> 01:37:41,735
You risked my ass
without telling me?

2023
01:37:41,819 --> 01:37:44,572
That's not cool, man.
For three fucking Gs?

2024
01:37:44,655 --> 01:37:47,324
That's... that's a good rate
for transporting that.

2025
01:37:47,324 --> 01:37:49,326
Shit, if I'd
told you,

2026
01:37:49,326 --> 01:37:50,494
you would have gotten

2027
01:37:50,578 --> 01:37:53,164
all fucking hinkey at the
border, man, gotten us nabbed.

2028
01:37:53,247 --> 01:37:55,166
I wouldn't have been
in the fucking car, dude!

2029
01:37:55,249 --> 01:37:57,585
I would've been on
motherfucking Greyhound.

2030
01:37:57,668 --> 01:37:59,587
That's a serious breach
of the homie code, man,

2031
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:01,255
not fuckin' telling me.

2032
01:38:01,255 --> 01:38:03,924
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry, you know.

2033
01:38:04,091 --> 01:38:06,260
I should've had...
I should've got you guys,

2034
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:07,845
you know,
walk across the border.

2035
01:38:07,845 --> 01:38:09,346
I could've met
you somewhere.

2036
01:38:09,346 --> 01:38:11,515
But, you know, I got
bills, I got shit.

2037
01:38:11,599 --> 01:38:12,850
I gotta put my shit
in storage.

2038
01:38:12,933 --> 01:38:15,186
I gotta get gas
out to Georgia.

2039
01:38:15,269 --> 01:38:17,188
Oh, fuck your money woes, dog!

2040
01:38:17,188 --> 01:38:19,273
I am not catching
a fuckin' case for you.

2041
01:38:19,356 --> 01:38:21,275
Let me out of the fucking car
right now.

2042
01:38:21,275 --> 01:38:22,860
Fuck, man. Come on, man,
let's drop this shit off.

2043
01:38:22,943 --> 01:38:23,861
Let's get paid!

2044
01:38:23,944 --> 01:38:25,362
Let me out right here.

2045
01:38:25,446 --> 01:38:26,864
Mi-Mi-Mi-Mike! Listen, listen!

2046
01:38:26,864 --> 01:38:28,199
Let me out right here,
right now!

2047
01:38:28,282 --> 01:38:30,201
You will feel so much better
with a fistful of twenties.

2048
01:38:30,284 --> 01:38:31,869
Huh?

2049
01:38:32,953 --> 01:38:35,456
Dude, we're drunk,

2050
01:38:35,539 --> 01:38:38,125
and we got a trunk full of
fuckin' weed, dude, I am not...

2051
01:38:38,209 --> 01:38:40,711
Okay, fuckin', Mike,
don't bitch out on me!

2052
01:38:40,711 --> 01:38:43,881
Don't fucking bitch out on me!

2053
01:38:43,881 --> 01:38:45,382
I am still on probation,
dick head.

2054
01:38:45,466 --> 01:38:46,967
Let me out now!

2055
01:38:47,051 --> 01:38:48,219
Let me out right here
right fuckin' now, dude!

2056
01:38:48,219 --> 01:38:49,970
Let me get paid, will you?

2057
01:38:50,054 --> 01:38:51,472
Will you fuckin'
let me get paid?!

2058
01:38:51,555 --> 01:38:52,556
Oh, yo, get paid, man.

2059
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:54,642
Fuckin' go for it,
all right?

2060
01:38:54,725 --> 01:38:57,144
Just let me get the fuck out.
I don't give a fuck, dude.

2061
01:39:00,898 --> 01:39:03,484
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

2062
01:39:03,484 --> 01:39:04,735
(yelling hysterically)

2063
01:39:04,735 --> 01:39:06,987
What the fuck
are you doing, Jim?

2064
01:39:07,071 --> 01:39:08,572
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

2065
01:39:08,656 --> 01:39:09,740
Fuck you!

2066
01:39:16,747 --> 01:39:19,583
Fuck, I'm sorry, dude,

2067
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:20,668
I'm sorry, dude.

2068
01:39:20,751 --> 01:39:22,753
Okay? I'm sorry.

2069
01:39:22,753 --> 01:39:25,089
Why the fuck did you put
a gun to my head?

2070
01:39:25,089 --> 01:39:27,842
Huh?

2071
01:39:27,925 --> 01:39:29,260
You gonna shoot me?

2072
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:32,012
No, man. I'm sorry.
I was trippin'.

2073
01:39:32,096 --> 01:39:36,267
I'd never...

2074
01:39:36,267 --> 01:39:39,436
I'd never put a fuckin' gun
to your head, dude

2075
01:39:39,436 --> 01:39:40,604
I know.

2076
01:39:40,688 --> 01:39:43,107
I know you wouldn't, man.
I'm sorry.

2077
01:39:43,190 --> 01:39:45,609
First your lady, now me, man.
What the fuck is up?

2078
01:39:45,609 --> 01:39:47,611
I'm not thinking.

2079
01:39:47,611 --> 01:39:49,113
I got too much shit going on.

2080
01:39:49,113 --> 01:39:52,867
(sniffling)

2081
01:39:52,867 --> 01:39:56,287
Oh, fuck, I'm just faded,
man, that's all.

2082
01:39:56,370 --> 01:39:58,289
I'm just fuckin'
fade right now, okay?

2083
01:39:58,372 --> 01:39:59,874
I'll cruise
you by your pad.

2084
01:39:59,874 --> 01:40:01,041
I'll drop you
off, man.

2085
01:40:01,041 --> 01:40:02,209
I'm sorry.

2086
01:40:02,293 --> 01:40:03,377
I'm sorry.

2087
01:40:03,461 --> 01:40:05,963
Yeah. You're a fuck-up.

2088
01:40:08,299 --> 01:40:11,969
I'm going with you so you
don't fuck this shit up, too.

2089
01:40:12,052 --> 01:40:16,557
We'll go to Casper's...
get the money.

2090
01:40:16,557 --> 01:40:17,558
Yeah.

2091
01:40:17,558 --> 01:40:19,059
Then you can
drop me off home,

2092
01:40:19,059 --> 01:40:21,896
you can go to Georgia fed out
and be the fuckin' man.

2093
01:40:21,896 --> 01:40:25,399
Yeah, I'm gonna be
the fucking man.

2094
01:40:25,399 --> 01:40:26,984
I can drop you
off, you know.

2095
01:40:26,984 --> 01:40:28,736
Take you up the hill.

2096
01:40:28,736 --> 01:40:30,154
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2097
01:40:30,154 --> 01:40:33,073
No.

2098
01:40:33,157 --> 01:40:36,660
Keep on going.

2099
01:40:44,001 --> 01:40:45,002
MIKE:
Looks sketchy.

2100
01:40:45,002 --> 01:40:47,087
JIM:
I don't know.

2101
01:40:51,258 --> 01:40:53,427
Ho, what, you gonna
shoot their pigeons?

2102
01:40:53,511 --> 01:40:54,595
Yeah.

2103
01:40:54,678 --> 01:40:55,930
Just hurry up.

2104
01:41:08,776 --> 01:41:10,194
Yo, Casper!

2105
01:41:14,782 --> 01:41:16,283
Buenos noches, señor.

2106
01:41:17,618 --> 01:41:19,286
¿Tiene losé cosatles?

2107
01:41:19,286 --> 01:41:20,538
Go pop the trunk, dude.

2108
01:41:29,964 --> 01:41:31,632
Con permiso.

2109
01:41:41,809 --> 01:41:43,060
(speaking indistinctly)

2110
01:41:47,231 --> 01:41:49,650
(dog barking in distance)

2111
01:41:53,237 --> 01:41:54,822

01:42:16,927 --> 01:42:18,262
You play, you pay.

2127
01:42:18,345 --> 01:42:19,597
He knew what time it was.

2128
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:21,348
Right.

2129
01:42:21,348 --> 01:42:23,017
Hey, we gotta bounce.

2130
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:24,351
You got the money?

2131
01:42:24,351 --> 01:42:26,687
Yeah, just let me

01:42:28,856 --> 01:42:31,025
Yo, bring the feria, homey!

2135
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:38,115
JIM:
Oh, fuck it!

2136
01:42:38,199 --> 01:42:40,034
CASPER: Yeah, now she can

2137
01:42:40,034 --> 01:42:41,285
FLACO: I got all the feria

2138
01:42:41,368 --> 01:42:43,120
It's all rolled

Ready to go, dog.

CASPER: Yo, hold up, dog.
Don't trip.

2143

I know these fools.
They're with me, ese.

2144
01:42:49,794 --> 01:42:50,878
These are the fools

2145
01:42:50,961 --> 01:42:53,214
Fuck these motherfuckers!
I'm shooting both of 'em!

2146
01:42:53,297 --> 01:42:55,549
At least give the homeboy
a pass right here, dog.

2147
01:42:55,633 --> 01:42:56,717
Yeah, yeah,

2148
01:42:56,717 --> 01:42:57,802
I don't give a fuck.

2149
01:42:57,802 --> 01:42:59,303
I want this white boy
in a box, though.

2150
01:42:59,303 --> 01:43:00,387
Hey, you in the ride.

2153
01:43:04,475 --> 01:43:05,810
Hey, just get the fuck

2154
01:43:05,810 --> 01:43:07,311
JIM:
Take off, homey.

2155
01:43:07,394 --> 01:43:09,396
I'll be cool.

2156
01:43:17,071 --> 01:43:18,739
What the fuck?

2157
01:43:19,824 --> 01:43:21,242
Don't trip, ese.
I'm cool.

2158
01:43:23,911 --> 01:43:25,079
Chill, dog! Chill, dog!

2159
01:43:25,162 --> 01:43:26,664
I got three kids...
(body thuds)

2160
01:43:26,664 --> 01:43:28,833
LIL' CHUCKY: Oh, no, please,

2161
01:43:28,916 --> 01:43:30,084
- No, no, no, no, no!

2162
01:43:30,167 --> 01:43:32,169
Please, please.

2163
01:43:36,757 --> 01:43:38,759
(dog barks in distance)

2164
01:43:41,595 --> 01:43:42,596
(raspy breathing)

2165
01:43:48,435 --> 01:43:50,104
(engine starts)

2166
01:43:51,689 --> 01:43:53,023
Why the fuck
did you do that?

2167
01:43:53,023 --> 01:43:54,525
(both shouting)

2168
01:43:54,525 --> 01:43:56,777
(tires screeching)

2169
01:43:56,777 --> 01:43:57,778
JIM:
Pull the door!

2170
01:44:40,988 --> 01:44:42,406
- (engine revving)
- Oh, my God, Jim!

2171
01:44:42,490 --> 01:44:43,407
I'm hit bad.

2172
01:44:43,407 --> 01:44:44,909
What have we done?

2173
01:44:44,909 --> 01:44:47,161
I can't move my arm...
and I can't feel my legs!

2174
01:44:47,161 --> 01:44:48,412
(whimpers)

2175
01:44:48,496 --> 01:44:50,664
I can't move shit.

2176
01:44:50,664 --> 01:44:52,917
I'm fucked up.
I'm fucked up.

2177
01:44:52,917 --> 01:44:54,251
I'm fucked up.

2178
01:44:54,335 --> 01:44:58,172
(gasping rapidly)

2179
01:45:04,261 --> 01:45:05,179
(Jim grunts)

2180
01:45:05,262 --> 01:45:06,430
MIKE:
Okay...

2181
01:45:06,514 --> 01:45:08,015
Don't trip...

2182
01:45:08,098 --> 01:45:09,600
Don't trip, dog.

2183
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,769
County Hospital's
right there.

2184
01:45:11,852 --> 01:45:13,187
No! No! No!
County Hospital...

2185
01:45:13,187 --> 01:45:14,688
Don't you dare
take me there!

2186
01:45:14,688 --> 01:45:16,524
Don't you dare!

2187
01:45:16,607 --> 01:45:18,275
I'm not going
out like that.

2188
01:45:18,275 --> 01:45:19,443
No, we're going.
No, no...

2189
01:45:19,443 --> 01:45:21,278
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, we're going.

2190
01:45:21,362 --> 01:45:23,030
No medical treatment.
No medical treatment.

2191
01:45:23,113 --> 01:45:24,782
But, but...

2192
01:45:24,782 --> 01:45:26,283
(gasping):
Mike, Mike...

2193
01:45:26,367 --> 01:45:29,036
You gotta kill me.
You gotta kill me.

2194
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:31,038
You gotta kill me.

2195
01:45:31,121 --> 01:45:34,625
Why? Why?

2196
01:45:34,625 --> 01:45:37,628
I fucked up.

2197
01:45:37,711 --> 01:45:38,879
Everything's shitty.

2198
01:45:38,879 --> 01:45:40,881
No, no...

2199
01:45:40,881 --> 01:45:42,550
Mercy kill me.

2200
01:45:42,550 --> 01:45:45,386
Ah... ah, please,

2201
01:45:45,469 --> 01:45:48,556
Ah, oh, no, dude.

2202
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:50,975
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

2203
01:45:50,975 --> 01:45:52,476
No, everything's
gonna be fine.

2204
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:53,978
Jim, shh-shh, shh-shh,
shh-shh, shh-shh.

2205
01:45:53,978 --> 01:45:55,062
Everything's gonna
be fine.

2206
01:45:55,146 --> 01:45:56,397
Everything's gonna be fine.

2207
01:45:56,397 --> 01:45:58,649
Take a look at me,
you dumb fuck!

2208
01:45:58,732 --> 01:46:01,152
Everything's gonna be fine?!

2209
01:46:01,152 --> 01:46:02,987
Come on...

2210
01:46:03,070 --> 01:46:05,990
You take my piece...

2211
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:07,992
and you put it
to my fuckin' head...

2212
01:46:08,075 --> 01:46:11,162
and you pull
the trigger.

2213
01:46:11,162 --> 01:46:12,913
You fuckin' step up...

2214
01:46:12,997 --> 01:46:14,665
No...

2215
01:46:14,748 --> 01:46:15,583
...and you do it.

2216
01:46:15,666 --> 01:46:16,750
No.

2217
01:46:16,834 --> 01:46:18,669
'Cause I can't.

2218
01:46:18,669 --> 01:46:19,837
(grunts)

2219
01:46:20,838 --> 01:46:22,590
(moans)

2220
01:46:24,341 --> 01:46:26,427
(sobbing):
Don't be a fuckin' pussy.

2221
01:46:26,427 --> 01:46:27,761
Oh, my God...

2222
01:46:27,761 --> 01:46:29,263
Don't think about it.

2223
01:46:29,263 --> 01:46:31,015
Huh?

2224
01:46:31,015 --> 01:46:32,016
Do it.

2225
01:46:32,016 --> 01:46:34,268
Please.

2226
01:46:34,351 --> 01:46:35,352
Just kill you and bail?

2227
01:46:35,436 --> 01:46:37,771
Yeah.

2228
01:46:37,771 --> 01:46:39,356
Just take off.

2229
01:46:39,356 --> 01:46:41,859
And don't look back...

2230
01:46:41,942 --> 01:46:43,444
or you'll...

2231
01:46:43,527 --> 01:46:47,114
or you'll turn into
a pillar of salt.

2232
01:46:47,198 --> 01:46:49,450
Hey... Hey...

2233
01:46:49,533 --> 01:46:52,453
you wanted to know what it was
like to kill someone.

2234
01:46:52,453 --> 01:46:56,207
What's up, huh?

2235
01:46:56,290 --> 01:46:57,458
No one's gonna know.

2236
01:46:57,541 --> 01:47:00,044
Hmm?

2237
01:47:00,127 --> 01:47:01,879
Just you...

2238
01:47:01,962 --> 01:47:03,964
and just me.

2239
01:47:03,964 --> 01:47:05,633
And God.

2240
01:47:05,633 --> 01:47:07,301
No fuckin' way.

2241
01:47:07,301 --> 01:47:08,719
- Huh?
- No fuckin' way.

2242
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:10,721
You're crazy; I'm not
shootin' you, dog.

2243
01:47:10,805 --> 01:47:11,972
It's mercy, dog.

2244
01:47:12,056 --> 01:47:14,141
It's mercy.

2245
01:47:14,225 --> 01:47:16,811
I deserve that.

2246
01:47:16,894 --> 01:47:18,479
I'd do it for you.

2247
01:47:20,064 --> 01:47:21,649
I'd do it for you.

2248
01:47:22,233 --> 01:47:25,486
Yeah.

2249
01:47:25,569 --> 01:47:27,488
Take it.

2250
01:47:27,571 --> 01:47:29,156
Yeah, yeah.

2251
01:47:33,911 --> 01:47:36,914
JIM (gasping):
Yeah, yeah... yeah...

2252
01:47:42,837 --> 01:47:45,422
D-Don't, don't
think about it.

2253
01:47:45,506 --> 01:47:46,674
Don't think about it.

2254
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:51,011
Yeah, yeah...

2255
01:47:51,095 --> 01:47:52,263
Ah, yeah.

2256
01:47:52,263 --> 01:47:54,932
Yeah.

2257
01:47:55,015 --> 01:47:57,601
Ah... ah...

2258
01:47:57,685 --> 01:48:01,188
You did this to yourself,
you stupid fuck!

2259
01:48:01,272 --> 01:48:02,439
You're always doing
stupid shit!

2260
01:48:02,523 --> 01:48:04,275
- I gotta fuckin' fix it!
- Okay, okay.

2261
01:48:04,358 --> 01:48:05,526
Is that what you
fuckin' want?!

2262
01:48:05,609 --> 01:48:06,694
- Yes.
- Huh?

2263
01:48:06,777 --> 01:48:08,195
You want me to fuckin'
fix your head,

2264
01:48:08,279 --> 01:48:09,780
- once and for all?!
- Come on, it's easy.

2265
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:11,115
It's easy.
No! Bullshit!

2266
01:48:11,198 --> 01:48:12,700
Bullshit! Not for me!

2267
01:48:16,287 --> 01:48:18,622
I love you,
fuckin' shit bag.

2268
01:48:18,706 --> 01:48:21,208
I love you, too.

2269
01:48:23,794 --> 01:48:25,379
I'm gonna miss you, brother.

2270
01:48:27,882 --> 01:48:29,049
I'm sorry.

2271
01:48:31,135 --> 01:48:33,220
I'm sorry.

2272
01:48:33,304 --> 01:48:35,055
- Everything's gonna be okay.
