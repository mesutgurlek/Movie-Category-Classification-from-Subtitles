1
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:08,865
Hike.

2
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,574
Stop it!

3
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,175
Go!

4
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:21,544
What's up, boys?

5
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:28,450
All right, let's go.

6
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,833
Let's go. Break.

7
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:51,675
Hike.

8
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,143
- What? Where are you going? Come here.
- Oh, my God, Dad.

9
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,482
Get in the car.
You're gonna be late for school. Come on.

10
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,088
- Mom's gonna kill you.
- What?

11
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,714
What are you doing?

12
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,123
Dad, I'm driving. No.

13
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,297
Get out of the car, Dad.

14
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,199
- What?
- Get out of the car.

15
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,482
- Seat belt.
- Yeah.

16
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:44,995
- What's the big deal?
- Can you just get in the car, please?

17
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,037
Let's go hunting.
Wanna go hunting this weekend?

18
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,437
Okay, let's go. Where are we going hunting?

19
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,500
You can use that old Jap 243
that Grandpa brought back from Truk.

20
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:36,074
- From where?
- Truk Islands, the South Pacific.

21
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,711
- Admiral Halsey, World War II.
- Yeah, right.

22
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,619
I was there.

23
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,583
You've been there, right, Dad?

24
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,719
No.

25
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,348
- Can I take your guys' picture?
- Why?

26
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,984
I'm just developing my portfolio right now,
doing random projects.

27
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,782
What's a portfolio?

28
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:19,550
It's when you put together pictures
to present your work.

29
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,157
- Get into galleries, stuff like that.
- What kind of work?

30
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,192
Anything. Like, portraits mainly.

31
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,494
- Like, naked people?
- No.

32
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:32,195
Want us to get naked with you,
take our picture?

33
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,974
No. I'm not for the outdoor-naked thing.

34
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,377
Public nudity is... No.

35
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,139
- No, we won't do that.
- All right, man.

36
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,839
Yeah? Okay, good.

37
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,175
You're too kind.

38
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,052
All right, let's go.

39
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,020
Be a little happier. Come on.

40
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,531
There you go.

41
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,827
Kind of look away.

42
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,164
Make a funny face.

43
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,135
One more.

44
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,066
Yeah, good. Keep walking.

45
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,639
Maybe one kiss.

46
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,815
Perfect. All right,
I actually gotta get to school.

47
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,254
- My name's Caroline.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Eli.

48
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,258
- Nice to meet you, too.
- What's up?

49
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,126
I'll give you guys a print
the next time I see you, or whenever.

50
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,996
- I'll try and make one today.
- All right. See you later, man.

51
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,601
All right, Dad, you stay here.
Paul will come pick you up.

52
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:25,716
Dad, just stay in the car. I gotta go.
Just stay in the car, please.

53
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,237
Hey, Paul? Yeah, it's John.

54
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,008
Dad's drunk again.

55
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,813
So, Mr. McFarland...

56
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,853
Hi, Mr. Luce. I'm sorry I'm late.

57
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,614
My dad took me out to lunch.

58
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,193
- I mean, breakfast.
- Meet me in my office.

59
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,324
I'm in trouble now.

60
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:17,593
Will you pick him up?
I'll leave the keys in the office.

61
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:22,101
Can you do it soon?
'Cause I don't know if he's gonna stay.

62
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,618
Set. Hike!

63
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,333
He's so cute.

64
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,411
- How are you?
- Good, and how are you?

65
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,037
I'm doing pretty good. How was Math?

66
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,948
- How do you think?
- That good?

67
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,718
That's all right, you know, it happens.

68
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,852
How's Sara doing?
Is everything okay with her?

69
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,928
She seemed a little off lately.

70
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,190
Yeah, I guess so. How's school for you?

71
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,868
It's about as good as it could be.

72
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,997
- Is P.E. Treating you all right?
- Yeah.

73
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,241
- Excuse me, miss?
- Yes?

74
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,780
- We need to sign out.
- Okay.

75
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,783
That picture was taken in Hawaii,
on the island of Maui.

76
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,776
What do you need, hon?

77
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,534
Get to class.

78
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,096
Don't be late for detention.

79
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,675
- Excuse me, miss? We need to sign out.
- Where was that picture taken?

80
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,749
That picture was taken in Hawaii,
on the island of Maui.

81
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,751
- That's real pretty.
- Isn't that cool? What do you need?

82
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,180
I need to leave these keys for my brother.

83
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,622
He's gonna come pick them up, 11:30-ish.

84
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,660
Put the keys in the envelope,
and put your brother's name on there.

85
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,322
His name's Paul.

86
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,468
By the way, what time will you be back?

87
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,437
Right around 1:30 p.m.

88
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,672
- 11:30 you said?
- Yeah, about.

89
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,745
- Okay, great.
- All right, thanks.

90
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,974
And don't forget to bring your own steaks.

91
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,743
- I'll see you then.
- Yeah, okay.

92
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,411
I'm saving for my car.
I'm paying it off this month.

93
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,509
Surprise!

94
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,762
Hello.

95
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,360
Hi.

96
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,076
What's wrong?

97
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,006
Nothing.

98
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,938
- You were crying.
- Yeah.

99
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,680
- Is it something bad?
- I don't know.

100
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:34,417
I'll see you later. I have to go
to a Gay-Straight Alliance meeting.

101
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,584
Okay.

102
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,999
Hi, Acadia, how you doing?

103
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,776
We were talking about
walking down a street being gay.

104
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,542
What do you think about that?
How can you tell?

105
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,117
- Or can you tell?
- Good question.

106
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,217
See, that's the thing. I don't think you can.

107
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,950
I think in some situations you can tell...

108
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,686
and there are situations
where people want you to know.

109
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,991
What makes you think you can tell?
If somebody wants you to know.

110
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,689
If someone has...

111
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,625
dyed pink hair.

112
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,201
Wait, what do you think about that?

113
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,567
I know it is,
but what do you think about that?

114
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,337
I don't think that wearing pink...

115
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:29,475
indicates your
sexual orientation necessarily.

116
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,414
- A lot of men wear pink.
- It is a lot, yeah.

117
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,849
Like rainbow necklaces.

118
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:37,479
I mean, if you have
tons of rainbow paraphernalia...

119
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,715
Jump in on this.
Help them out here a little bit.

120
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,452
Come on.

121
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,088
Did you guys see the cover story
on The Oregonian about the gay rams?

122
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,224
Yeah. See, this is a good topic here.
Go ahead.

123
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,895
Because apparently the farmers can't tell
if the rams are gay or not.

124
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:57,032
So you get a ram to breed and it's not...

125
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:01,311
so they waste a lot of money.
So they're doing all this research.

126
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,847
They spend, like, $10,000 on a ram.

127
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,349
That's a lot of money for one ram.

128
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:11,345
But the scary thing is
if they know what causes homosexuality...

129
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,654
is that something you could change,
something you could remove?

130
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,126
There's all this
weird political stuff around it.

131
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,562
I don't think we're talking about
the change, necessarily.

132
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,464
We're talking about
if we notice somebody on the street...

133
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,037
if we can tell they're gay.
I don't think you can.

134
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,265
How in the world do we know their spirit?

135
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:32,366
If they wear one of those bracelets,
the rainbow and stuff, that's a giver.

136
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,743
Somebody walking on the street,
all dressed up, wearing high heels...

137
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:39,215
Rainbow bracelets don't necessarily mean
that you're gay.

138
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,447
I've never seen anybody wear one
that isn't gay.

139
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,785
- Me, for example.
- Then why would it even matter?

140
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,128
You're wearing a bracelet
and you're not gay. Who cares either way?

141
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:56,167
- What time will you be back?
- Right around 1:30 p.m.

142
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,493
Okay.

143
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,165
Here's the deal.

144
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,339
Aaron and I and some of the other boys...

145
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:09,175
we're gonna go fourbying later today.

146
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,914
We were wondering if maybe you would
like to bring some of the girls along.

147
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,478
Don't you remember
what happened last time?

148
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,524
- Of course. How could I forget?
- With Sara and Jessica?

149
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:24,892
- Sara and Jessica, they're...
- Don't be mean.

150
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,398
I never tease you about Jason
and his hot dogs, or whatever.

151
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,864
That was an isolated incident.

152
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,237
Besides, I don't know if I can go.

153
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,200
I don't know what time I'll get home.

154
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,969
- Home from the appointment?
- Yeah.

155
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,611
Does that, by any chance, have to do with...

156
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:48,345
when we went camping,
two or three weeks ago?

157
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,751
I don't know. It could be anything.

158
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,116
You know what? You don't have to worry
about it. You know why?

159
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,695
Because we're gonna
have a blast fourbying...

160
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,230
as long as...
You gotta promise to show up.

161
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,401
- Hey, Eli!
- What's up, John?

162
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,634
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

163
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,307
- What are you doing?
- Just taking pictures.

164
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,176
- Can I take a picture of you?
- Yeah, sure.

165
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,511
Okay, ready? One, two, three.

166
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,684
- Nice.
- I'll see you later.

167
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,256
- You going to the concert tonight?
- No, my parents are being bitches.

168
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,259
That's retarded. That happens.

169
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,261
All right. I'll see you.

170
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,781
Boomer!

171
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,452
Come here.

172
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,362
What are you guys doing?

173
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,595
Get the fuck out of here
and don't come back.

174
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:48,764
- Some heavy shit's going down.
- What are you doing?

175
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:07,548
When the electrons jump
from one orbital to another one...

176
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:11,993
what does that do?
What's the difference between the orbitals?

177
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,958
The orbitals differ in energy.

178
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,667
The orbitals, which are areas in space
around the nucleus...

179
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,933
the ones that are closer to the nucleus,
those are low energy...

180
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,702
and the ones that are further away
are higher energy.

181
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,109
So when we put energy into the atom...

182
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,477
it kicks these electrons out...

183
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:34,210
further away from the nucleus,
and produces a higher... Yes?

184
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,613
After putting electricity
into the tube full of the electrons...

185
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:42,092
after they're lit up, do they stay lit up
or can they run out of energy?

186
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,526
Good question. What they do...

187
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,059
is they will sit up
in this higher energy state...

188
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,665
and then drop down again.

189
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,533
And when they drop down, they emit light.

190
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,073
What are you writing?

191
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,205
- This?
- Yeah.

192
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,373
It's my plan.

193
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,314
- For what?
- You'll see.

194
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,423
- Hey, Eli, what's up?
- Hey, how are you?

195
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,991
Not much. I'm just gonna go
to the darkroom and stuff, so...

196
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,839
Yeah. Watch out for Mr. Robertson's class.

197
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,634
Yeah, I know. No kidding.

198
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,233
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Okay. Bye.

199
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,118
- How you doing?
- Pretty good, actually.

200
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,981
- How about you?
- Fine.

201
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:06,246
Michelle, look, we've got to talk
about this gym clothes problem.

202
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,911
This is not gonna do it, these long pants.

203
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,614
Everybody else is wearing shorts.
What's the matter?

204
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:13,623
I don't want to talk about it.

205
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,694
I don't want to give you a mark
against you, either.

206
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,559
But I'll have to do it
if you can't show up in shorts...

207
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:21,063
like you are supposed to.

208
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,566
Look, I won't do anything about it
this time...

209
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:27,729
but tomorrow, I want to see those shorts.

210
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,233
Okay!

211
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:41,759
There's that nerd girl
who sits behind you in Math class.

212
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,555
- That one right there.
- Yeah. Her.

213
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,032
Green panties?

214
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,330
Loser.

215
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,908
- Where'd you take that at?
- The bleachers outside.

216
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,979
Pretty blurry, though.

217
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,465
- What's that?
- It's a rip in his shirt.

218
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,262
I thought it was coming out of her head.

219
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:10,001
- I took that outside at the park earlier.
- Really?

220
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,079
That's pretty. Where'd you take that at?

221
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,486
At my house.

222
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,348
That's my light assignment.

223
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:33,089
Great contrast. I like how you can barely see
the fence right there.

224
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:04,092
I think I'll make another print, though.
It came out too light.

225
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,554
Yeah, you should burn in right here.

226
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,172
- Hey, Eli.
- What's up, John?

227
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,077
- How's it going?
- Good, how about you?

228
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,912
- Pretty good. What are you doing?
- Just taking pictures.

229
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,418
- Can I take a picture of you?
- Yeah, sure.

230
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,117
Okay, ready? One, two, go.

231
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,459
- Nice.
- All right, I'll see you later.

232
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,827
- You going to the concert tonight?
- No, my parents are being bitches.

233
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,490
That's retarded. That happens.

234
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,261
All right. See you.

235
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,675
Come on out here.

236
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:44,517
I got a job for you here.
You can take these books...

237
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,591
and you can reshelf them right over there,
if you would, please.

238
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,820
I'll be here if you need me.

239
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,900
- That's what they told me.
- I don't know.

240
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,068
- I mean, it's really hard to decide.
- Yeah, I know.

241
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,674
I mean, the money's really nice, but...

242
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:14,145
He's so cute.

243
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,775
- Did she see you?
- Who?

244
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,444
Did she see you?

245
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,080
- Who?
- Her. His girlfriend.

246
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,391
He has a girlfriend? Since when?

247
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,188
- You didn't know?
- No, I didn't.

248
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,489
A long time.

249
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:28,030
- Are you joking?
- I hope she didn't see you.

250
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,431
- She's not gonna do anything.
- She hit a girl last time for that.

251
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,765
- Hit a girl?
- She slapped a girl.

252
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,031
No way.

253
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:37,840
She smiled, he smiled, and she slapped her.

254
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,342
My gosh, I cannot believe that.
Are you joking?

255
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,742
- I saw it.
- Why wouldn't she slap him?

256
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,610
- Because...
- It's not the girl's fault.

257
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,046
All girls do that.

258
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,119
- In the middle of the hall?
- Yeah. After school last Friday.

259
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,417
Wow, I am so tired.
I haven't been getting any sleep lately...

260
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,959
'cause every morning, I wake up
and my mom's going through my stuff.

261
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,028
- Going through your stuff?
- Yeah.

262
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,927
Completely, like,
ruffling through my covers and like...

263
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,692
- Your covers?
- Yeah.

264
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,928
Like, what would I hide there?
What am I gonna be hiding?

265
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,436
I don't know.
Didn't your mom used to do that to you?

266
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,804
She did that a couple days ago.
She was going through it, and I said:

267
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,241
"Don't go through my shit.
I don't go through yours.

268
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,041
"It's not like you own my stuff.
I don't own your stuff."

269
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,015
I don't know. I talk to her about it,
and she'll be like:

270
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,642
"Okay, I'm sorry. I won't do it anymore."

271
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:26,519
And then all of sudden, I'll come home,
and she's in my room.

272
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:30,058
They think it's their job
because they're the parents of the house.

273
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:33,289
I'm sick of it. I want out of here.
I'm so ready to go to college.

274
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,262
Yeah, I wanna get out of here.

275
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:38,426
Only one more year, though, you guys.

276
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:41,103
One more year. Count it down.

277
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,469
- What to eat?
- I can't wait to go off campus.

278
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,580
- Can I help you?
- Can I have a milk?

279
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,206
Wait, no, I think I want a Capri Sun.

280
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,519
- Can I have a juice?
- I'll have that milk. Thanks.

281
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,178
Juice. This one.

282
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,490
Yeah. Thanks.

283
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,024
What do I want?

284
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:08,296
- None of it looks that good.
- It never does.

285
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,163
- Some kids like this stuff.
- Thank you.

286
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:14,203
I know, they come back for, like,
seconds and thirds.

287
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,136
They just keep coming?

288
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:25,849
Salads?

289
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,808
It's too crowded. Let's go to the back.

290
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:03,351
- Where's a table nobody's sitting at?
- Where's your salad dressing?

291
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:07,515
- I don't eat salad dressing anymore.
- You don't? I thought you loved it.

292
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:11,322
No, I hate it. I used to like it,
and then I tried once without it.

293
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:14,192
- I cannot stand it without.
- You know it has fat?

294
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,698
You know salad dressing has
20 grams of fat in it?

295
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,268
- Shut up.
- It's not like it stays in us anyway.

296
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,201
I can't believe you just said that.

297
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,830
- What if somebody heard you?
- It's the truth.

298
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:25,707
Is that John?

299
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,768
What is he doing?

300
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,039
- Is that a dog?
- I didn't know he had a dog.

301
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,615
Why would he bring it to school
if he did have a dog?

302
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,378
- I have no idea.
- Maybe he just found it.

303
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,818
You guys want to go shopping today?

304
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:45,691
That sounds like fun.

305
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,455
I don't know. Ben wanted to do something.

306
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,591
- Are you joking me?
- What?

307
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,061
This is the fifth day in a row
you're not hanging out with us.

308
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:58,437
You guys, it's like,
how much time do you want?

309
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,638
Put a number on it.

310
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:05,641
I don't even want to talk about it.
You spend so much time with him.

311
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,650
You get, like, 75% to 85% of my time.

312
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,921
- Yeah, right. More like 20%.
- You do!

313
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,150
School, after school...

314
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:17,159
You know, you can't have both weekends.
I need to split it a little more evenly.

315
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,525
We're not just people
to be pushed out of the way.

316
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,394
I'm not saying that.
You're both very important to me.

317
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:25,468
I'm supposed to be your best friend
and you pushed me out of it.

318
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:29,266
You're both equally as important,
but my time has to be split up.

319
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,807
What do you want? 95% and he gets 5%?

320
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:35,777
Your friends are supposed to be
just as important, if not more.

321
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:40,977
- All the time. Haven't you ever heard that?
- I've heard that, but it's different.

322
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,849
I've been there for you, through everything.

323
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:47,913
We've been best friends for, what,
three years now? Since high school started.

324
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:51,586
- I know, I'm working.
- I'm done, guys.

325
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,396
Let's just go.

326
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,395
I'm going shopping.

327
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:00,533
Sounds like fun. I'll go.

328
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,505
I don't want to be
the only one not going. I'll go.

329
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,939
Okay, I'll go, but you cannot drive.

330
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,874
Yeah, you're not driving.

331
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,673
I am such a good driver.

332
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,011
- You are not.
- That's mean. You guys can't say that.

333
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:22,385
I don't understand because everyone else
thinks I'm a good singer...

334
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,428
and a couple of weeks ago,
when I sang Star-Spangled Banner...

335
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,394
everyone thought it was really good.

336
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,366
That's why I'm really confused
that you would say something like that.

337
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:35,003
Seriously, I mean, why?
Why do you think I'm such a bad singer?

338
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:38,040
Do you guys have cars?
Because I don't think you do.

339
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:40,269
So, how else are you
going to get anywhere?

340
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:43,403
We'll go, just drive 15 under the speed limit.

341
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,607
You have to have your hands at ten and two.

342
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:47,741
- That's no fun.
- Go back to the basic rules.

343
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,115
When you guys get your licenses,
you'll understand.

344
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,485
We'll understand?
I just want to live to get my license.

345
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:57,315
- We want to live to see the rest of our lives.
- I'm not gonna kill you.

346
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,759
It'll be in the newspaper...

347
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,888
I might run into a couple of people
on the way, but...

348
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,489
It's not funny.

349
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:08,364
Oh, my gosh. It'll be fine. We'll just go.

350
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:14,271
- This is disgusting.
- I ate too much.

351
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,938
I always feel so fat after I'm done eating.

352
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,477
- Every time.
- Do you ever get...

353
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,381
- The pudge there?
- Where it sticks out above your belt?

354
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:25,011
And you can't get rid of it, no matter what.

355
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,120
So gross.

356
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:45,651
That's awesome.

357
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,493
What's up?

358
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:55,646
You suck.

359
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:47,918
- See you tonight, dear.
- Yeah.

360
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:52,558
You know, Jared's got the pole this week
and the track record.

361
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:10,804
What's that smell?

362
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:13,114
That's just your mom.

363
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:18,316
You could find other places to eat.
I'm sure there's better restaurants in town.

364
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,150
No, you're the best.

365
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,417
- Want more of these?
- No thanks.

366
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,068
All right, lock the door.

367
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:43,037
The radio has wholly taken over.

368
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,846
Many of the cinema's...

369
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,443
- What was that?
- I don't know.

370
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,616
All scripts must now be vetted.

371
00:54:57,594 --> 00:55:00,927
The casting of actors must be approved.
From now on...

372
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:05,263
the German people will only know
what their Führer wants them to know.

373
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:07,233
Propaganda brought us into power.

374
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:08,804
That's a lot of flags.

375
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,464
- This was made in Germany, right?
- Yeah.

376
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:15,601
Propaganda will enable us
to conquer the world.

377
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:20,414
In his early Munich days,
Hitler had taken an old Hindu symbol...

378
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:23,816
the hooked cross, the Swastika,
as the Nazi symbol.

379
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:27,015
Now he multiplies it a million times.

380
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:36,659
From the Romans, he steals the standards...

381
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:40,896
- Can you still buy Nazi flags?
- Sure, if you're a nut.

382
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:45,506
From Mussolini, he steals the Fascist salute.

383
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:48,676
Check it out.

384
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:54,381
Führer, command, we follow you.

385
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,177
The Führer is always right.

386
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:01,950
Who's that guy?

387
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,354
- That's Hitler, right?
- Yeah.

388
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:07,055
...who fears the intellect
and hates all intellectuals.

389
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:10,860
So into the flames are flung the works
not only of German philosophers...

390
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:13,936
scientists, doctors, poets,
playwrights, novelists...

391
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,868
but those of all the world.

392
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:19,504
Students as well as storm troopers
obey the Führer's orders.

393
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:23,409
Any culture except Nazi Kultur
must be destroyed.

394
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,810
Hey, how you doing?

395
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:29,651
You guys must be out of school today.

396
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:31,482
- Yeah.
- Good for you.

397
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:34,615
I'll have you sign for me here.

398
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:41,695
That's great. Thank you very much.

399
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:46,960
Sweet. It's here.

400
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,706
At a vast meeting in Berlin...

401
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:58,304
Mussolini thanks Germany for her help
in his brutal Abyssinian War.

402
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:08,623
And the Führer replies:

403
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:17,188
- Oh, yeah, dude.
- This is so awesome.

404
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,493
"Peace," did Hitler say?

405
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:25,937
Let's check this shit out, man.

406
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,142
- Hell, yeah, dude.
- Sweet.

407
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:46,757
Back up.

408
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:00,335
Whoa, dude, that was awesome.

409
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:50,082
Hey, Eli!

410
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,785
- What's up, John?
- How's it going?

411
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:53,328
- Pretty good. And you?
- Good.

412
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,863
- What are you doing?
- Just taking pictures.

413
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:58,399
Can I take a picture of you?

414
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,535
- Nice.
- I'll see you later.

415
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:12,342
- You going to the concert tonight?
- No, my parents are being bitches.

416
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,483
- All right.
- See you.

417
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,193
Hi, Michelle. Glad you could make it.

418
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:01,695
Please come in and sign in here,
then come out.

419
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,824
There are a few things
we can work on together.

420
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:09,396
First, if you want to just take this
cart of books...

421
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:12,201
and you can reshelf it over there
in the non-fiction.

422
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:15,334
I'll be right here to help you if you need me.

423
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:24,509
I guess this is it. We're gonna die today.

424
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,710
Yeah, I've never even kissed anybody.
Have you?

425
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:46,332
"I don't appreciate you
putting signs out like that."

426
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:50,099
The next day, he called up his friend
and has him put out another sign.

427
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:54,302
And she doesn't see it.
And so he puts out another one.

428
01:01:56,279 --> 01:02:00,272
Like, right in front of her house,
in front of her apartment thing.

429
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:01,944
It says:

430
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,913
"Tim Campbell's whorehouse
has been shut down."

431
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:11,422
Or "Has been placed under new ownership
by" whatever her name was.

432
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:14,187
He couldn't cut it anymore.

433
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:18,098
All right, let's see this.
So, we'll park here, right?

434
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,335
We'll enter through the south entrance.

435
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:29,772
Then we go past the trophy case and the
medal case, enter through the language lab.

436
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:32,245
They don't use it anymore,
so nobody'll be there.

437
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:39,014
We'll gear up there,
we'll hear the primary explosions...

438
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:41,090
go about here in the cafeteria, right?

439
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:47,596
When that goes, we should be able
to pick off kids...

440
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:49,164
as we traverse the east wing.

441
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:54,830
And then we have another explosion
that should go off here in the gym...

442
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,734
and here in the auditorium.

443
01:02:56,839 --> 01:03:00,036
At that time, there should be
kids flushing out in all directions...

444
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:02,407
and we'll be able to pick them off,
one by one.

445
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:14,082
After that, you'll hit your yellow line here,
which is your plan B.

446
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:17,884
And you'll go up through Mr. Luce's office
and take care of that.

447
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:20,987
Fuck!

448
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:23,725
While I go, on the red line,
up through this hallway...

449
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,700
where we'll have the best targets,
dumb-ass jocks and shit.

450
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,265
Because we'll have a fucking
field day down there.

451
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:33,900
I mean, come on.
You've got your Tec-9 and your rifle...

452
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,804
and I've got my shotty and my.223
on my back.

453
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:39,404
And I got a couple pistols and a knife.

454
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:42,484
We have enough explosives to last us
almost a day.

455
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:45,076
- Most importantly, have fun, man.
- Yeah, man.

456
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:21,481
What are you guys doing?

457
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:25,884
Get the fuck out and don't come back.
Some heavy shit's going down.

458
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:36,662
Hey, don't go in there.

459
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:41,669
Hey, you guys, don't go in there.
Something bad is gonna happen.

460
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:44,138
Don't go in there, okay?

461
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,246
Dude, what the fuck?

462
01:05:56,852 --> 01:06:00,083
Don't worry about it, it's probably just slow.
Let's go to plan B.

463
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:02,953
- Are you sure you set it right?
- Positive.

464
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,239
Sir, don't go in there! Trust me!

465
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:21,071
Just don't go in there, please. Don't go in!

466
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:23,702
Dad!

467
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,050
Hey, you guys...

468
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:40,989
What was that?

469
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:45,282
- Sounded like bombs. That's fine.
- No more homework, no teachers.

470
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:48,026
- That'd be so cool.
- That'd be nice.

471
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:50,799
- Hi.
- What's wrong?

472
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:53,635
What the hell is wrong with you?

473
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,328
Okay, then be a bitch.

474
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:57,805
What a freak.

475
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:10,011
I think maybe everyone could bring...

476
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:13,483
Well, I don't drink soda,
but some people do...

477
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:15,746
What was that?

478
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:18,088
Firecracker. Don't worry about it.
It'll be okay.

479
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:20,526
Come on, sit down. Let's finish this.

480
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:23,655
Okay now, we talked about
what we're gonna do...

481
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,327
Nate? Come on, get up, Nate.

482
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,206
Here we go, let's go.

483
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,529
Come on, let's go, now!

484
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,070
It sounds clear. Go!

485
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:45,834
Down the hallway to the band room exit!

486
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:47,775
Hey, Mr. Luce.

487
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:53,179
Why are you doing this?
Eric, put the gun down.

488
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:55,273
I ain't putting shit down!

489
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:59,049
Put the gun down, we'll talk about this.

490
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:00,178
Shut up!

491
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:13,992
Dad!

492
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:21,405
The school's on fire.

493
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:24,206
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, what's going on?

494
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,080
I saw two guys come in the other side.

495
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:28,615
Holy cow!

496
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:32,743
They had big black bags
and camo gear on.

497
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:34,083
My God.

498
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:37,619
- Where did you go?
- I just...

499
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:40,758
I'm sorry.

500
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:18,595
Yeah, you did, and I should shoot you
right now for it, you know I should.

501
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:22,899
But I think I just might let you live,
maybe, because I want you to know this...

502
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,872
and the next kids that come up to you
with their problems...

503
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:28,772
that they're being picked on,
you should listen to them...

504
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:31,277
no matter what twisted shit they say.

505
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:39,779
Fuck.

506
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:42,148
Anyway, Mr. Luce, whatever.

507
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:46,417
You know there's others like us
out there, too.

508
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:50,828
And they will kill you if you fuck with them
like you did me and Jared.

509
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:54,828
Get out of here,
before I change my mind. Go!

510
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:07,107
Bitch.

511
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,012
"So foul and fair a day I have not seen."

512
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:14,940
Fuck!

513
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:44,211
- Oh, my God, there he is!
- Oh, shit!

514
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:01,483
Hey, man. I wouldn't drink that.
You'll get herpes or something.

515
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:07,355
- So how did you do?
- Did all right. What happened?

516
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:10,991
I shot the principal
and some other people, and...

517
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:17,925
Well, well, well.

518
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:21,925
Look who it is.

519
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,572
Dude, come on, don't do this.

520
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:26,265
- Eeny...
- You stupid fuck!

521
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:27,933
...meeny...
- What are you doing?

522
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:29,533
...miny...
- Please.

523
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,408
...moe.
- Don't.

524
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:34,505
- Catch a tiger...
- This isn't something you wanna do.

525
01:17:34,616 --> 01:17:37,915
...by his toe.
- Please.

526
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:40,352
If he hollers...

527
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:44,021
- You're fuckin' sick. Don't do this.
...let him go.

528
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:45,423
Eeny...

529
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:47,025

530
01:17:47,396 --> 01:17:48,693
