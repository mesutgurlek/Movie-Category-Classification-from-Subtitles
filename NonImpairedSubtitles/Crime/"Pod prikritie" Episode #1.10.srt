3
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:48,639
The recording proves Tudzharov's
relations with the drug market.

4
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,199
There is some mistake.
It's in here.

5
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,279
I know
there is a traitor in the squad.

6
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:03,159
I can here you. Where shall we meet?

7
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:06,239
I found the phone number of your rat.

8
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,279
It's getting hot.
I have to get away. Are you with me?

9
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,039
Search the homes of all boys.

10
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,799
As a desert let them all go
through a polygraph test.

11
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,159
That's Sunny's bracelet.

12
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,279
Do you work for the police?
- No.

13
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:29,159
No.
- No.

14
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:31,239
No.
- Yes.

15
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,599
He's lying.

16
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,639
No.

17
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,599
Are you into women?

18
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,759
Is there a special one?

19
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,879
No.
- He's lying.

20
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:45,599
You have to meet an informer.

21
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,479
You've got mail.

22
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,479
Internal Affairs.

23
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:52,599
You are arrested for taking a bribe.

24
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:59,919
Do you think I'm dumb.
If so, we have a problem.

25
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,599
The next one
after Chavdar will be Jarro.

26
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,719
We caught Jarro's mole.
You have to go on.

27
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:16,279
Don't tell me you are a cop.

28
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,959
BULGARIAN  NATIONAL  TELEVISION

29
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,519
What were you thinking about?

30
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,959
When?
- While we were making love.

31
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:45,279
It sounds strange
when you say it like that.

32
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,439
Should I say "while we were fucking"?

33
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:50,439
CAMERA  Production Company

34
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,399
I don't know, but...
- That's the expression

35
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,799
when you fuck someone you love.
- Have you ever loved me?

36
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,839
PRESENT

38
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,119
Yes. All the time.

39
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,479
And see what I get - pain only.

40
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,799
I'm sorry
for wanting to leave like that.

41
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,559
It was spontaneous.
- Rome is a fine city. I understand.

42
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,399
Would you go there on a honey moon?

43
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:25,079
IVAILO  ZAHARIEV

44
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,959
What, now?
- Talking about spontaneous.

45
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:33,639
Well, I don't know... Just now...
- When then?

46
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:41,719
I chose you among many others.
Will you make me beg?

47
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,799
IRENA  MILYANKOVA

48
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:48,279
Okay, I'll marry you, but...

49
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,439
You are beautiful
when you set conditions.

50
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,799
ZAHARI  BAHAROV

51
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,919
I've got something to do. Wait here.
Don't make me search for you.

52
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,159
VLADIMIR  PENEV

53
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:30,479
MIHAIL  BILALOV

54
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:38,719
Are you driving his car now?
- A precaution after the hit.

55
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,519
ALEXANDER  SANO

56
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,479
I see. You and him are getting close.

57
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,399
I learn from you.
- You can't get Jarro without me.

58
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,159
I'll catch him before you say 'yes'.
- I already accepted.

59
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:59,559
DEYAN  DONKOV

60
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,839
What?
- That makes your choice easier.

61
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:11,479
You are insane.
- And you are a freeloader.

62
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,119
You shouldn't have accepted.
You'll be charged too.

63
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,159
KIRIL  EFREMOV

64
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,559
Sex with a cop reduces the sentence.
- You confuse things.

65
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:29,719
On the contrary. I think of myself.
- You want me to tell you

66
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,559
how much I care about you
while he's in the bank?

67
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:37,439
Wasn't this part of your mission?

68
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,479
VENTSISLAV  YANKOV

69
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:48,559
You are not part of my mission.
I don't want any change between us.

70
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:54,079
I don't like today's rich men.
They have more money than wits.

71
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:57,879
Unlike you.
- I'm from the old school.

72
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,239
MARIAN  VALEV as The Hook

73
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:03,959
I play it safe.
- That's why I offered you

74
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,079
that investment portfolio.
You won't lose anything.

75
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:12,719
You are my first private banker, who
takes care of every penny of mine.

76
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,879
I'll think about it.

77
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,599
All right then. I want a deal.

78
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,199
I'll help you catch Jarro
but then I want to disappear.

79
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,919
Drive me to this shop.

80
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,399
I want you to look at some rings.

81
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,879
Good news this time.
You've caught Jarro's singer.

82
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:15,919
So there's no problem to go on.
- There's always a problem.

83
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:18,559
I don't understand.

84
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:24,199
What's this?
- When my missions over,

85
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:30,079
I'll have to take cover. I want
a guarantee for a new life in Rio.

86
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:34,959
It can be arranged.
- I mean for me and Sunny.

87
00:08:35,319 --> 00:08:37,559
Sunny.

88
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,239

GEORGI  IVANOV

89
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,439
Tudzharov's girlfriend?
Don't say you're involved with her.

90
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,159
She knows I'm a cop.
She saw your text message.

91
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,039
Do you really sleep with her?
- It doesn't matter.

92
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:58,119
She'll ruin everything.
- She wants to help us.

93
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:02,799
I'm not listening to nonsense.
You should get away at once.

94
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,239
Director of Photography
ALEXANDER  STANISHEV

95
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,599
Sunny will testify against Jarro.

96
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:11,719
Why would she?
Pardon me! Because she loves you.

97
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:16,119
Where are you going?
- I'll think of something.

98
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:20,119
Come here, we'll find a way.

99
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:28,799
After the trial I want two tickets
and new life in Rio.

100
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,599
Like we were not born here.

101

Director
ZORAN  PETROVSKI

Original Idea
DIMITAR  MITOVSKI

104
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,799
I need to meet Vein's brother.
It's the only way to solve this.

105
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,759
Impose your conditions
for the meeting.

106
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,159
I hate negotiating with barbarians.
- I'll do it.

107
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:08,359
Please. Find a good place.
- By all means.

108
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:11,959
He wants revenge.
We have to be careful.

109
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,639
I go to the john with a guard.

110
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,359
You can meet a playground.

111
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,679
His kid was blown, so...
- He won't be aggressive there.

112
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:30,759
That'll do.

113
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:52,199
Popov here.

114
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:58,919
Benishev from National Security?
I know you. What is it?

115
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:08,559
Yes, I've heard about that company.
Why?

116
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:15,279
We already discussed the paid leaves.
We are not talking again.

117
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:21,279
Did Sherlok Holmes go on leave?
- He's a character from fiction.

118
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:26,239
You show some character
and you can rest for a week.

119
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,839
Popov, what's up?

120
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,479
I want to see you alone.
- Go now.

121
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,879
Benishev from National Security
called me.

122
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,519
What do those fashion models want?
- A meeting.

123
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,399
About Z.W.U. company.
- You don't say!

124
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,079
We were wrong about the protection.
- But they stopped the investigation.

125
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:16,039
Exactly. I want to find out
what's going on.

126
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:24,199
Good. Don't tell them much.
They only want to be stars.

127
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,159
We won't give them presents.

128
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,359
Man, shall we try a joint?
- The new stuff is terrific.

129
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:54,359
I hope so,
last time I coughed my lungs out.

130
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:57,279
Do you want a drag?
- I'll pass.

131
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:02,079
It'll help you for the dances.
- Maybe Simona wants a drag.

132
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,279
Simona doesn't.

133
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:10,599
I got such an appetite,
I'll stuff like a pig.

134
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,919
Who are those guys?

135
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,319
Times are tough,
but to share a cigarette...

136
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:22,439
Go away.

137
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,639
Criminal police. Documents, everyone.

138
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,919
Wait!

139
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:35,199
Empty your pockets.
- My wallet's in the bag.

140
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:39,279
You don't want me to do it for you.

141
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:42,839
What this?
- FNR. Forest non-tree resources.

142
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:47,919
For 6 grams of non-tree
you'll easily get 8 years.

143
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,239
Don't, please!
- I'm 17 and I have glaucoma.

144
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,399
I lost him.
- But we got the glaucoma guy.

145
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:02,559
Check the documents
of both young ladies.

146
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:14,279
What's the problem, Benishev?
- Why there should be a problem?

147
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,799
I wouldn't be here otherwise.

148
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:20,879
A drink?
- No, thanks. Let's talk.

149
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,319
All right.

150
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,879
What do you know about
Bulgarian-German company Z.W.U.?

151
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:35,359
Besides being a part
of Tudzharov's laundry?

152
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:42,599
Let's go like this: you do
the talking, I do the listening.

153
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:49,359
We started investigating Z.W.U.
- Yes, it's common knowledge.

154
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:54,759
Some interesting names popped out.
- What names?

155
00:14:55,599 --> 00:15:01,039
Of companies close to Z.W.U.
Like some S.U.N.N.Y. -

156
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,799
an offshore company,
registered in Lichtenstein.

157
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:10,759
Some S.U.N.N.Y.
I expected a bigger surprise.

158
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,319
We really do our job.
- Does Tudzharov know that?

159
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,839
He will soon enough.

160
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:22,679
We started tracing a diplomat.

161
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,199
Each month he carries for Tudzharov
big sums to Lichtenstein.

162
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:31,599
He flies to Zurich,
then rents a car to Lichtenstein

163
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,799
and leaves the suitcase
with the money in a lawyer's office.

164
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:38,759
It's the local representative
of S.U.N.N.Y.

165
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,159
It's getting interesting. Well?
- Well... nothing more.

166
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:49,199
S.U.N.N.Y. transfers money to Z.W.U.
- ...which buy lands

167
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:53,359
and luxury property
and is clean like baby's bottom.

168
00:15:54,759 --> 00:16:00,239
It means you do have a problem,
Benishev.

169
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:25,799
Are you alone?
- You are crazy!

170
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,399
I'm sorry.
- Don't scold me.

171
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:34,679
What if one of the guys was here?

172
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,399
Where is he?

173
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,559
He did the important job
and went to a meeting with partners.

174
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:46,359
I see.
- Look, Martin...

176
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:54,759
I want to be sure...
that you really are with me.

177
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:07,119
Jarro is dining tomorrow
with Boris Zhelev, the politician.

178
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:13,119
They have some common business
and since I'll be at the dinner...

179
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,239
B.Z.

180
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,799
Martin?
- Yes.

181
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,119
I can record their conversation.
- You? No way!

182
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:33,279
Why?

183
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,399
I'm Jarro's wife.
Nobody will suspect me.

184
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,719
I don't want you to get involced.

185
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:47,879
In theory Jarro is
behind Z.W.U. and S.U.N.N.Y.

186
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,159
And in reality?

187
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:54,359
In reality we cannot charge him
on circumstantial evidence.

188
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:58,839
So you want us to be your pals?
- No other way.

189
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:04,359
Do you know how rich Tudzharov is?
- I haven't made calculations.

190
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,479
His annual income from illegal
business is roughly over 100 million.

191
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:13,599
What do you need from me?
- A little help.

192
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:17,559
If we prove that S.U.N.N.Y. assets
are from illegal activity,

193
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,959
the authorities in Lichtenstein
will unveil bank secrecy.

194
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,479
You want me to prove it.
- We know little about Tudzharov.

195
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:30,959
Why then you took away Z.W.U.?
- Can we work together?

196
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,039
No, if it means that I have
to tear off Tudzharov's balls

197
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:40,359
for National Security
to wave them proudly.

198
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,039
It's a matter of interpretation.
- Your interpretation.

199
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:48,919
Mine is as follows: you tell me
all you know about him

200
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,159
and I arrest him.

201
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,759
Whatever.
It was an unofficial meeting, so...

202
00:18:56,999 --> 00:19:00,239
Let's forget it.
- Fine by me.

203
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,399
That's your best offer so far.

204
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,879
Who's Milen?
- My boyfriend.

205
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:17,799
When they searched him
they found the weed!

206
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:21,919
Don't worry so much.
Everybody smokes in that yard.

207
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,519
Were you smoking?
- No, not even Milen.

208
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:29,159
He only does it with pals for fun.

209
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,919
What's going on?

210
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,799
Why are you crying?

211
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:46,999
If it's because of some dumb ass,
I'll break his head at once.

212
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,599
Her boyfriend was busted
for possession of weed.

213
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:58,159
Big amount or for personal use?
- For personal use.

214
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:03,119
A joint before going to bed?
- I had to do something.

215
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,039
Every time he pays the price!
- Poor soul!

216
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:11,959
Not to worry. They'll give him
2 years, he'll be out in 1.

217
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:16,959
Try to wait for him.
- He'll not go to jail.

218
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:23,439
It's a good place to achieve manhood.
Or womanhood.

219
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,079
It depends on his cell-mate.
- Stop scaring her!

220
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:31,319
Don't listen to him.

221
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:39,159
Don't be afraid.
Try to send him more parcels.

222
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,839
Do you remember this photo?

223
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:09,839
Where did you find it?
- Me and your father

224
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:14,319
had just returned from Libya.
Look how happy you are.

225
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:17,559
I didn't see you often, that's why.

226
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:25,039
I know what you're telling me.
That I wasn't a good mother.

227
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:32,119
I hope you forgive me some day.

228
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:38,719
Forgive you for what?
- When we left with your father

229
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:43,039
we were ambitious doctors
and dreamed of a breakthrough.

230
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:46,199
We dreamed to give you everything.

231
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:51,159
And now you wonder
whether it was worth it?

232
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:54,559
I missed too many moments with you.

233
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:59,039
I'd like to... turn back the clock.

234
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:04,799
It's all right.
- You are a good son.

235
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:12,079
You grew up alone and now you take
care of me. I don't deserve it.

236
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:18,599
Nobody deserves to be alone.
- What about you?

237
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:24,679
If there was a woman by your side,
I'd be at ease.

238
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:28,599
There is.

239
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,359
There is one.
- Are you in love?

241
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:40,519
I want to show you something.

242
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,959
What's this now?

243
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,519
A gift to me from your father
for your birth.

244
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:54,719
Will she like it?
- She's got everything. Keep it.

245
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:59,599
Tell her it's from me. It's different.
What are her hands?

246
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,399
Will this fit her?
- There's no way.

247
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,879
Why?

248
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:10,519
Don't you two go out?

249
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:16,399
Together?
- We do. We just do that.

250
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,639
What is she?

251
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:31,319
A choreographer.
She dances all day long.

252
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:37,439
Be patient, she'll like you.

253
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:42,319
If you say so.
- That's the first time

254
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:46,359
you share with me about a woman.
Thank you.

255
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:48,679
Don't tell anybody.

256
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,039
I won't.

257
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:10,479
Popov, you're back.
How was it at National Security?

258
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:18,159
Funny. They work on Z.W.U.
but they are in deep shit.

259
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:25,599
They need help to close the case.
- We grant help only for Christmas.

260
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,839
That's what I told them, but...

261
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:33,319
Come in.
I'll be with you in a minute.

262
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:37,719
But what?
- I want back the case on Tudzharov.

263
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:40,999
Talk to the Chief Secretary.
- How can I?

264
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,799
You go hunting together.
- I'd be ashamed to.

265
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:50,159
Every time we go close to Tudzharov,
it's a major fuck up.

266
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:56,719
Because Todorov was his singer.
- Give me one successful operation

267
00:24:56,879 --> 00:25:00,479
against Tudzharov
and you'll be a TV star.

268
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,959
The Chief will also show good will.
- In that case you'll have it.

269
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:26,759
You've been reading for too long.
Anything unclear?

270
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,719
Do you charge me by the minute?
- You seem absent-minded.

271
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:36,639
Does it show?
- No. But I know you very well.

272
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:42,119
I'm thinking about Popov.
I heard he plans action again.

273
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:46,639
Why don't we offer money to him?

274
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:50,559
He doesn't care about money.
He plays honest.

275
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:53,359
Every breathing creature
has his price.

276
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,319
It's easier for him to humiliate
a rich man than to become one.

277
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:02,759
You know why?
Nothing in this life depends on him.

278
00:26:02,879 --> 00:26:08,519
If he catches me in a tight spot, it
would be a compliment for him.

279
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:12,079
But I cannot be dependent
on an asshole

280
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:16,199
that doesn't know the difference
between billiards and golf.

281
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,199
How do you intend
to put pressure on him?

282
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:26,719
I've taken care already.
You'll read it in the papers.

283
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,919
Wait, nothing has happened yet.
- No.

284
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:32,759
We'll have drink on another occasion.

285
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:44,639
I proposed to Sunny.
I'm getting married.

286
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:52,839
Sunny.

287
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:59,839
You never told me anything.

288
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:04,919
Probably because you are not
my marriage agent.

289
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:49,319
So who killed my brother?
- I don't know.

290
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:53,479
I don't do the cops' job.
- I see.

291
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:58,719
Check who took Ventzi's districts.
You'll get the correct answer.

292
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:04,279
If you talk about Chavdar,
I took care of him.

293
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:18,239
I heard that two Serbs
interrupted his last blowjob.

294
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:24,199
But I also heard of a missile
that was aimed at my Audi.

295
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:30,039
You'll all be blown for my brother.
- I had respect for Ventzi.

296
00:28:30,199 --> 00:28:35,039
Are you making passes at me?
- I'm telling the truth.

297
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:40,479
And to prove my respect for you
I offer you the heroin in Sofia.

298
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,919
Heroin is a dying business.

299
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,839
Yes, but you'll have no competition.

300
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:30,239
Peter Tudzharov develops a new
channel for smuggling cigarettes.

301
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:34,719
The master boxes arrive
from Cyprus by boat to Varna.

302
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:40,639
The goods are unloaded on the coast
and are then transported by trucks.

303
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:44,959
The trucks bring the cigarettes
to a secret depot.

304
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:50,439
Then they are transferred
to vans and are disguised.

305
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:53,079
The disguise is baby puree.

306
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,599
They take the cigarettes
to a small factory for baby food.

307
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:04,879
Inside the goods are redistributed
and leave directly for Germany.

308
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,359
Talk to me in figures.

309
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,519
A truck contains
9 million cigarettes.

310
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:18,759
The trucks are two. Do your math
for the loss of the state from taxes.

311
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:37,399
Where were the cigarettes headed for?
- Germany, as far, as we know.

312
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:41,839
What is the profit from that?
- I don't know.

313
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:46,279
But the loss of the state
from taxes is 2 million.

314
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:50,479
What happens with the cigarettes?
- I'm giving up smoking,

315
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:54,519
so my colleagues will guard them.
- Your final comment?

316
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:59,039
The Agency did its job.
That's what matters. Thank you.

318
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:02,159
Are you happy now?
- Sure.

319
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:07,839
So we'll talk to the Chief Secretary.
- I'll do what I can.

320
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:13,359
I don't know about the profit.

321
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:17,679
But the loss of the state
from taxes is 2 million.

322
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:21,959
What happens with the cigarettes?
- I'm giving up smoking,

323
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:26,039
so my colleagues will guard them.
- Your final comment?

325
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,639
Are you Zornitza Popova?
- I'm her mother.

326
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,319
She is summoned by the police.
Sign here.

327
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:43,919
Did anything happen?
- I really don't know.

328
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:58,039
Hey... are you kidnapping me?

329
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,079
I don't know why I conceded.
- What's that?

330
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:08,119
There is a recorder in this one.
- Is this for the dinner?

331
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:11,839
Is it still on?
- All goes according to plan.

332
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:14,679
You turn it on like this.

333
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:20,119
Take a look. Do they become me?
- Be careful.

334
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,639
Nothing will happen to me.

335
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,039
Don't put the roses in the cart.
- Where are they for?

336
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:36,239
Your room.
Beware not to kill them this time.

337
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,639
You should have taken cacti then.
- Can you do something right?

338
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,399
I've got no time to water roses.
- What are you so busy with?

339
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,879
I educate myself, you know.

340
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:52,639
Does education include this?

341
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:00,119
Why did you open it?
- You are summoned as a witness.

342
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:03,959
Are you involved in drugs?
- Mom, calm down.

343
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:06,239
Explain. What happened?

344
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:13,999
Some cops busted Milen with weeds.
Not me though.

345
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:16,639
Really! Let's celebrate then.

346
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,239
I just had a couple of drags
as an exception.

347
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:25,479
Let me smell your breath.
- Don't be ridiculous.

348
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,119
One day you'll probably
be on methadone program.

349
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:37,519
You're not telling the Boss, are you?
- Not this time.

350
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,479
The Boss is your father
and he should know.

351
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,919
Did you hear the news?
- What?

352
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:54,639
They acquired the case of Tudzharov?
- No, better.

353
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:58,879
You were noticed after
the operation with the cigarettes.

354
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:01,879
So?
- You are promoted! Congratulations!

355
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:08,439
What do you mean?
- Forget about Jarro now.

356
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:11,999
You'll be chief
of "Analyses and Information".

357
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:16,439
You'll be in possession
of every secret of this office.

358
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,519
"Analyses and Information".
Is this some joke?

359
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:25,159
Why do you think so?

360
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:31,199
They are taking from me Jarro's case!
- Don't be like that.

361
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,479
Your experience is appreciated.

362
00:35:34,439 --> 00:35:38,439
For 20 years
I've been tracing Jarro every hour.

363
00:35:39,319 --> 00:35:43,599
Is that my award?
- Finish it in one week,

364
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:47,719
then Vassil will take over.
He'll deal with Jarro.

365
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:54,399
One week. Vassil.
- Show him secret files, whatever.

366
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,039
And you better shave.

367
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:10,479
The hostess of the show
asked the winner:

368
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:13,279
"What's your opinion
of Bulgarian men?"

369
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:15,959
And she most earnestly declared:

370
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:20,559
"Bulgarian men are the best
in the country."

371
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:28,839
So much for fair contests.
- Ladies, would you like a digestive?

372
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,759
Why not?
- At the bar it'll be quicker.

373
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:41,719
I'll just leave my earrings,
my ear hurts.

374
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:46,319
They seem cheap.
Are they vintage or something?

375
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,479
I haven't used to them yet.

376
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,199
Are you happy
with your cop's promotion?

377
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:05,079
We'll see the result.
How did you arrange it?

378
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:09,079
Directly with the minister.
We owe him a favour.

379
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:14,479
You could appoint him a security
consultant when his mandate is over.

380
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:21,279
It depends on his performance.
- How's the cigarette business?

381
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:25,479
You ask too much. Why is that?

382
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:30,199
I put them in a safe place.

383
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:36,799
Give me a cigarette.
- You give me one.

384
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:41,519
You've used me long enough.
- I would give you, but haven't any.

385
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:47,279
You're all giving up smoking and
I'm the only one who doesn't smoke.

386
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,839
I'll smuggle a couple of stacks.

387
00:37:55,999 --> 00:38:00,279
Man, there is nothing here!
- What do you mean?

388
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,239
Damn it!
- They've taken out the cigarettes!

389
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:15,439
What are you staring!
It didn't happen on our shift!

390
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:22,079
You have something on your mind.

391
00:38:22,479 --> 00:38:25,239
Addie, you, women are fucking queer!

392
00:38:26,799 --> 00:38:31,159
If it paid being with a woman,
I would be with one.

393
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:33,399
Philosophers too!

394
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:36,439
You are pissed, it's obvious.

395
00:38:37,919 --> 00:38:40,439
Shall I pick you up?

396
00:38:44,879 --> 00:38:46,959
Pour me "Black label".

397
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:51,839
Are you ready?

398
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:54,639
We managed perfectly.

399
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:57,399
We took out all the stacks.

400
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:01,999
While the cops find out,
Germans would have smoked them all.

401
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:04,119
Good.

402
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:09,079
Nothing more?

403
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:27,439
Are you on a diet
or do just dances keep you fit?

404
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:30,079
Workout is the best way.

405
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:48,959
As to the contest everything is fine.
- Such words scare me.

406
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:56,679
You'll have to make an effort though.
- An effort, worth how many grands?

407
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:00,879
Wait.

408
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:11,639
This is my opinion.

409
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:16,559
Your pen can only write up to 15.

410
00:40:22,759 --> 00:40:25,999
Are you serious?
- The difference of 10%

411
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:31,239
is due to the deputy minister.
- Is he an elephant to eat so much?

412
00:40:31,399 --> 00:40:35,799
You'll be given check-points for
reconstruction at the Turkish border.

413
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:38,999
Everyone kisses hand
for such procurement.

414
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:46,079
Boris, I never kiss hand or ass.
It's the other way round.

415
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:52,839
We eat healthy food.
- Boris likes rare meat, very spicy.

416
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:56,879
It's not recommendable.

417
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:01,879
Come on.

418
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:11,439
Everything will be ready in days.
- I don't want problems.

419
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:14,519
I'll hold you responsible.

420
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:19,399
Yana, did you boast to Sunny
with your present?

421
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:23,159
Not yet.
- We had a special occasion.

422
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:26,399
Our 10th anniversary.

423
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,399
Diamonds.

424
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:36,039
You should polish them regularly.
Because they blacken too.

425
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:43,799
I wonder about your choice.
Cheap trinkets give you rashes.

426
00:41:45,759 --> 00:41:48,879
Sorry, I'll never put them on again.

427
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:01,799
It was a pleasure.
- Good night.

428
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:04,359
Good night.
- Good night.

429
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:17,079
May I?
- What are you doing.

430
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,519
You are embarrassing me with these
in front of those simpletons.

431
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:27,119
I thought they were good on me.
- How much is this junk?

432
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,279
Jarro... Jarro, please...

433
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:58,359
Jarro, please!

434
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:03,919
Be behind the restaurant
in 30 seconds!

435
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,199
You turned out to be
a little dirty whore!

436
00:44:36,919 --> 00:44:42,279
Turn off the light, please.
- Sorry. I didn't know you're here.

437
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,159
Pretend I'm not.
- We have to talk.

438
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:55,519
When do I make an appointment?
- I don't want to here nonsense now.

439
00:44:56,279 --> 00:45:00,479
You're not answering your mobile,
you don't come home...

440
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:03,879
When you're here,
you're still absent.

441
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:07,039
Shall I fill a missing person report?

442
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:11,719
The minister promoted me.
Are you happy now?

443
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:17,159
Promotion? Great.
Now we'll see each other even less.

444
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,919
You must be pleased.

445
00:45:22,999 --> 00:45:27,479
When? Because I'm getting sick too.

446
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:31,399
They're probably fighting
because of me.

447
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:37,599
I'm not imagining.
She'll betray me for the summons.

448
00:45:41,799 --> 00:45:47,199
Milen was never his favourite
and now with the weed...

449
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:02,999
Nothing in my job
is good for table conversation.

450
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:07,479
What do you want to hear?
About the rats...

451
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:12,519
About the bodies? About drugs?

452
00:46:14,999 --> 00:46:18,039
I just wanted to tell you something.

453
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:22,119
First, I'm not pleased
with the promotion.

454
00:46:24,799 --> 00:46:27,519
When will you stop chasing him?

455
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:32,199
I was this close to an arrest.

456
00:46:33,799 --> 00:46:36,599
They took the case from me.

457
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:42,879
You are really obsessed by Jarro.
I thought when we moved...

458
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:47,479
He was one of my closest friends.

459
00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:55,159
You know how he acted in the end.
I cannot forget it.

460
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:59,639
I know.
I know something else too.

461
00:47:02,279 --> 00:47:04,599
It interferes with my family.

461
00:47:09,759 --> 00:47:11,879
Sorry.

462
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:23,759
Good afternoon, sir.

463
00:47:28,999 --> 00:47:33,359
Very good lighter.
- You can't find those any more.

464
00:47:34,759 --> 00:47:36,879
Is it on sale?

465
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:51,839
Come on! At last!

466
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,119
I haven't tried the brandy yet.

467
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,559
Many happy returns!

468
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:05,719
Quiet now! The present!

469
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:11,159
I know what it is.

470
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:27,399
It'll give you light in the dark.
- It was hard to get it. It's unique!

471
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:31,999
It's either unique, or it's not.
Guess who chose it.

472
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:34,439
Alex?

473
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:39,079
Was it you Preacher (Popov)?!

474
00:48:39,999 --> 00:48:42,159
Wait. wait...

475
00:49:19,279 --> 00:49:21,439
Jarro!

476
00:49:22,839 --> 00:49:26,879
Preacher?
- You didn't expect to see me, eh?

477
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:31,119
I'm glad to see an old friend.
- Friend...

478
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:35,599
Your trick
won't take me off your back.

479
00:49:35,759 --> 00:49:40,559
Why is this hatred?
I heard you got promoted.

480
00:49:41,759 --> 00:49:44,879
In the past such occasions
were celebrated.

481
00:49:45,799 --> 00:49:50,159
So you arranged it.
- What? I arrange many things.

482
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:54,919
I'll chase you till I get you.
- Preacher...

483
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,999
Why are you taking
everything personally?

484
00:49:58,879 --> 00:50:01,879
Because with you
it's always personal.

485
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,559
Fine, here I am. Arrest me.

486
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:17,279
You are still the same pussy
and son of a bitch.

487
00:50:17,399 --> 00:50:20,359
And you are still naive, Popov!

488
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:25,999
We have mutual respect with some of
your colleagues! What do you hope for?

489
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:33,119
I hope one day
you'll find what you deserve.

490
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:38,919
Preacher...

491
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:57,559
Sorry I'm late.
Have you been waiting long?

492
00:50:57,759 --> 00:51:02,199
No, I just came. I heard about
the promotion. Congratulations.

493
00:51:02,879 --> 00:51:06,999
You know why I'm transferred?
- I can guess.

494
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:12,519
You are in someone's way.
- This someone has a name.

495
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:17,519
You know it.
- Look at it from the good side.

496
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:20,839
I can't see it.

497
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:25,439
"Analyses and information".
With info you can rule the world.

498
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:31,919
I'm glad you'll take my place.
You're familiar with the department.

499
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:35,959
Not exactly.
Share the secret data with me.

500
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:39,279
They're secret for a reason.

501
00:51:46,439 --> 00:51:49,959
Just this one?
- There's one more.

502
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:55,279
But... we'll need more time for it.

503
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,359
I've got time.

504
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:07,399
Now? All right.
But I'll ask you...

505
00:52:08,919 --> 00:52:14,119
Keep me in the course of things.
I ask you as a friend.

506
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:16,839
Excuse me.

506
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,799
My wife.

508
00:52:19,919 --> 00:52:23,759
Say it quickly.
- I like it that way!

509
00:52:23,919 --> 00:52:27,039
I'm listening.
- I want to remind you

510
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:29,959
of the present
for my brother's birthday.

511
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:34,079
I found something...
- I insist to choose it!

512
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:38,879
It's tonight at 8. Don't forget.
- Tonight?!

513
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:42,599
All right.

514
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:46,839
Excuse me. We can't do it today.

515
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:51,879
I'm off. We'll do it tomorrow.

516
00:52:54,359 --> 00:52:56,479
Bye.

517
00:53:04,679 --> 00:53:07,039
Is Sunny here?
- No.

518
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:14,279
She asked for stuff for the hall.
It's in the car.

519
00:53:14,439 --> 00:53:17,959
Shall I bring it?
- Maybe I'll not see her.

520
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:21,279
Why?
- She's unavailable since last night.

521
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,719
Maybe she took a day off.
- Maybe.

522
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,719
Jarro doesn't seem worried.

523
00:53:29,879 --> 00:53:33,479
Then I'll take the stuff to the club.

524
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:51,039
Dad... Hi.

525
00:53:52,959 --> 00:53:56,039
You've got the right to be mad.

526
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:06,199
This with the marijuana was dumb...
I'm sorry!

527
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:12,639
I'm not in a mess all the time...
- I'm ready!

528
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:17,199
I'll call a cab.
- The cab will wait.

529
00:54:17,319 --> 00:54:19,479
I'm listening.

530
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,479
I'll tell you later.
- Sit!

531
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:43,799
Tell me about it.

532
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:49,399
With maximum details.

533
00:54:55,239 --> 00:54:57,959
Boss, you wanted to see me.

534
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:06,079
This junk there...
Put it in bags and burn it.

535
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:43,639
Have you lost something?
- Do I look like I have?

536
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:49,239
Worse. You look like someone
who fucks his boss's woman.

537
00:55:49,399 --> 00:55:51,399
Man, it's not true!

538
00:55:54,999 --> 00:55:57,199
Or you steal her jewels.

539
00:55:57,319 --> 00:56:01,519
This is a present from Jarro.
- Where did you find it?

540
00:56:01,639 --> 00:56:03,999
I found it at your place.

541
00:56:05,479 --> 00:56:09,119
Such nice things happen
and you are fighting.

542
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:14,479
Here, read
while I'm in the sauna.

543
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:17,079
End of this story.

544
00:56:17,799 --> 00:56:21,479
Ventzi the Vein's brother
is killed by explosion

545
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:17,159
