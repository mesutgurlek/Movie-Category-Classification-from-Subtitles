<i>Previously on Veronica Mars:</i>

2
00:00:03,877 --> 00:00:06,608
It's been a year since my best
friend, Lilly Kane, was murdered.

3
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:09,141
Everyone remembers reading
about the bungling local sheriff.

4
00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:11,620
That bungling sheriff was my dad.

5
00:00:12,357 --> 00:00:16,056
Duncan Kane. He used to be my boyfriend.

6
00:00:16,864 --> 00:00:22,238
Then one day, with no
warning, he ended things.

7
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:25,674
What do you think Mom was doing at
the Camelot Motel with Jake Kane?

8
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:28,076
I told you to stay away from that case.

9
00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:30,446
Do you know what your joke cost me?

10
00:00:32,556 --> 00:00:35,355
- You, say you're sorry.
- I don't want his apology.

11
00:00:35,628 --> 00:00:39,862
- Forty-four Adam.
- Forty-four Adam, affirmative.

12
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:49,340
I look back over the past week and wonder
if things could've turned out differently.

13
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:54,513
If I hadn't met the girl, if I hadn't
initiated the case, if I hadn't interfered...

14
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:59,529
would tonight be just another dull,
quiet night in our apartment complex?

15
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,431
Miss, out of the way.

16
00:01:10,182 --> 00:01:14,246
Is it my fault a horrible crime
played out its final chapter here...

17
00:01:14,423 --> 00:01:16,984
or was what happened inevitable?

Sync by vNaru

19
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:10,909
- Hey, Rocky.
- Hey, Veronica.

20
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,086
- Hi, neighbor.
- Oh, hey, Veronica.

21
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:21,353
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, fine.

22
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,060
Oh, your Snow Patrol CD. I'll get it back
to you, I swear. I've just been so into it.

23
00:02:26,237 --> 00:02:28,207
I know. I can hear it through the ceiling.

24
00:02:28,374 --> 00:02:32,210
Oh, God, you can hear us
fighting, can't you? I'm sorry.

25
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,113
- What was the fight about?
- Oh, it was nothing.

26
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:38,449
You're right, it's not my business.

27
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:40,149
No.

28
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,125
It's just stupid. I...

29
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:45,563
My journal's missing. I think he took it.

30
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:47,567
- Really?
- Yeah.

31
00:02:47,738 --> 00:02:51,176
He somehow got it into his head
that I have a thing for my boss.

32
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:57,252
Suddenly, the journal disappears.
It's sort of my diary/sketchbook.

33
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,912
But it's got some way
personal stuff in there.

34
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:02,419
I hope it turns up.

35
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:04,086
Hey, Killer.

36
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:09,170
- Do you mind if I...?
- No, go ahead. He lives for the attention.

37
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:11,069
You are so lucky he's your dog.

38
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:14,805
I would immediately put him
in a little sailor's outfit.

39
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:17,709
Veronica, can I ask you a favor?

40
00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:20,788
I have a doctor's
appointment Tuesday morning.

41
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,620
I'm getting some test results.

42
00:03:22,794 --> 00:03:26,823
- Do you need a lift?
- And maybe some handholding.

43
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:28,629
Of course.

44
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:32,642
Mr. Echolls, I was wondering
if I could have a word.

45
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,975
"Anthropomorphic. " All yours, big guy.

46
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,852
Your father has generously offered
to donate a pair of boots...

47
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:41,853
for our school fundraising auction.

48
00:03:42,024 --> 00:03:45,325
Not the ones made for walking?
God, I love those boots.

49
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:48,160
The pair he wore in Hair Trigger.

50
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:51,100
We're hoping we'll be able to
pay for our new scoreboard...

51
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,869
with what we'll make off of them. I
haven't been able to reach your father.

52
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:57,515
I was hoping you could remind him.

53
00:03:58,117 --> 00:04:01,054
I'll have my assistant call his assistant.

54
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,827
Let's see, Carrie Ann Leski
went on to be Miss California.

55
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:11,436
Of course, then she went
on to gain 40 pounds.

56
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:15,840
Oh, and Jake Kane. Big computer
mogul, and I sat next to him in typing.

57
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:19,108
Surprisingly slow, typing-wise.
He's a brilliant man.

58
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:21,310
Ronald Toolen, of Toolen Motors.

59
00:04:21,487 --> 00:04:24,013
Are you married? Because
I hear he's separated now.

60
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:29,599
Veronica. Just the girl I was looking
for. I'd like you to meet Evelyn Bugby.

61
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,270
Aren't you cute?

62
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,102
Evelyn is from the alumni
association. She can use help...

63
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:39,909
putting together a photo
display for a class reunion.

64
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:41,746
If only I had the spare time.

65
00:04:44,156 --> 00:04:46,319
Bob Patton, is that you?

66
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,123
Class of '79.

67
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:55,400
Think of all the bad clothes you can
mock: Velour shirts, platform shoes.

68
00:04:57,077 --> 00:05:00,480
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Great.

69
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:05,021
Your first assignment is to scan and
print all of the photos Mrs. Bugby tabbed.

70
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,323
And please keep her away from me.

71
00:05:13,504 --> 00:05:18,376
Very nice. Oh, excuse me, I have to go
talk to her for a second. Did you say...?

72
00:05:23,753 --> 00:05:27,691
And somewhere, amidst the Most Likely
to Succeed and Class Sweetheart...

73
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:32,162
my mom, Lianne Reynolds, Most Likely
to Disappear off the Face of the Earth.

74
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:55,694
They teach you manners in ESL?

75
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:59,138
If I was gonna cheat, don't you
think I'd pick somebody smart?

76
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:01,475
If you was gonna.

77
00:06:04,751 --> 00:06:06,618
Alas...

78
00:06:07,022 --> 00:06:08,820
you both get zeros.

79
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:13,627
No talking during tests.

80
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:19,235
Guess Mrs. Daniels ain't
giving it up at home, huh?

81
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:24,475
The glow of your father's wealth
and celebrity may be enough...

82
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,516
to sustain you through high school...

83
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,987
but do you know what it will
get you in the real world?

84
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:35,327
Please say "high school English teacher."
Please say "high school English teacher."

85
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:37,667
Mr. Navarro.

86
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:41,776
I wonder if you'll find Mr. Echolls
so amusing 10 years from now...

87
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:45,006
when you're pumping his gas.

88
00:06:46,351 --> 00:06:50,757
See me after class, both of you. I'll
tell you where to report for detention.

89
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:55,992
You know what I love?

90
00:06:56,167 --> 00:07:01,267
I love that I get a zero for talking when
you were the one who was talking to me.

91
00:07:02,077 --> 00:07:06,072
You get detention for dissing the
teacher in front of everybody...

92
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,651
and I get detention for laughing.

93
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:13,488
- Let me ask you something, man.
- Jesus, is this detention or hell?

94
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:16,757
How do you people not
make yourselves sick?

95
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:19,597
I mean, it's like you walk
on water in this school.

96
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:22,936
For what? It's nothing that you do.

97
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,341
All that matters is
who your parents are...

98
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:28,450
and the zip code your mom shot you out in.

99
00:07:28,618 --> 00:07:31,384
But if I donate to the United
Latino Pain-in-the-Ass Fund...

100
00:07:31,557 --> 00:07:33,116
will you shut the hell up?

101
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:35,957
You like playing with yourself?

102
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,630
Or you wanna make things interesting?

103
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:40,394
What did you have in mind?

104
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:46,204
You're almost as bad
an actor as your father.

105
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:50,376
You know that you don't need a
diploma to steal hubcaps, right?

106
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,488
I mean, why do you even show up here?

107
00:07:52,924 --> 00:07:54,984
Promised my grandmother.

108
00:07:55,395 --> 00:07:56,761
I don't break my promises.

109
00:07:57,398 --> 00:07:59,026
And I mean this:

110
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:06,405
Is this Reno or detention?

111
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:09,444
Would you believe the best of both?

112
00:08:11,187 --> 00:08:13,315
- Oh, come on, man.
- What the hell?

113
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,015
Dude, we're playing a game here.

114
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,090
This is punishment,
gentlemen, not party time.

115
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:21,828
Well, that would explain the
absence of balloon animals.

116
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:24,804
The two of you may not have
learned respect in the home...

117
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:27,501
but you are going to learn it here.

118
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:30,616
And you now have a full week of
detention for me to teach you...

119
00:08:30,784 --> 00:08:33,346
without luxury time for playing cards.

120
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:50,115
- Why did you tell her?
- I assumed she knew. She's your mother.

121
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:54,243
I didn't want her to know about the baby.
I can't believe you told her where I was.

122
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:56,483
- You're just being hormonal.
- Shut up!

123
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:59,858
Go spend the night with Joanna!
Maybe then she'll stop calling here!

124
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:02,193
Get over it, Sarah! Grow up!

125
00:09:31,147 --> 00:09:34,482
- Did you hear something last night?
- What kind of something?

126
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:37,615
Like a loud thump from upstairs.

127
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,589
Well, no. But you know me, I can
sleep through an earthquake. Why?

128
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:45,794
I don't know. It sounded like a
falling body. It really freaked me out.

129
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:48,669
- A falling body?
- Yes, a falling body.

130
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:52,576
Would you describe the
sound as Hitchcockian?

131
00:09:52,748 --> 00:09:55,013
I'm glad you're able
to entertain yourself.

132
00:09:55,185 --> 00:10:00,182
Oh, sweetie, don't sell yourself short.
I find you completely entertaining.

133
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:01,851
You're dressed awfully early.

134
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,465
I'm taking Sarah to the
doctor before school.

135
00:10:04,634 --> 00:10:09,506
- Well, that's mighty neighborly of you.
- I'll see you back at the ranch, partner.

136
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,604
Sarah?

137
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:54,612
Sarah, it's Veronica again.
Give me a call when you get this.

138
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:57,148
I'm just getting a little worried.

139
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,195
The people that say high school
years are the best years...

140
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,564
are usually on the yearbook staff.

141
00:11:09,738 --> 00:11:14,337
I just pray that bake sales and pep
rallies aren't as good as it gets...

142
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,615
and that the prom isn't the most magical night
of my life, like it was for this golden...

143
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,350
Oh, my God.

144
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:28,561
- So how's life with the movie star's kid.
- Oh, he makes juvie hall seem like vacation.

145
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:32,264
Yeah? You should tell him you spend
some quiet time with Lilly Kane...

146
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,874
his precious girlfriend.

147
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:39,074
I'd love to see the look on his face when he
finds out you tapped that fine, white ass.

148
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:41,414
You shut your mouth with that, man.

149
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:44,024
You don't know what you're talking about.

150
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:46,389
And it wasn't like that, all right?

151
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:51,970
What? What'd I say?

152
00:11:55,844 --> 00:11:57,176
Hey, what's up?

153
00:11:57,347 --> 00:12:01,343
- I've got a little Neptune High trivia for you.
- Yeah?

154
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:06,153
Did you know that your dad and my
mom were king and queen of the prom?

155
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:10,465
Which, I guess, means they were,
like, a couple or something.

156
00:12:11,737 --> 00:12:13,501
Did you know about that?

157
00:12:13,673 --> 00:12:15,699
No.

158
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,310
It's weird, huh?

159
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:19,972
The boy does have a gift for evasiveness.

160
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,451
Last year, he broke up with me
without so much as an "it's over."

161
00:12:23,622 --> 00:12:25,318
What's going on?

162
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:31,456
What's going on is I had lip gloss on
my teeth for, like, all of first period.

163
00:12:31,635 --> 00:12:35,073
Why is Duncan pretending
I no longer exist?

164
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:41,247
Because he's a freak. I don't know.
I'm his sister, not his shrink.

165
00:12:42,252 --> 00:12:46,384
It's like he's broken up with me, but
hasn't gotten around to telling me yet.

166
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,659
He has been weird the past few days.

167
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,496
Maybe his right hand finally said no.

168
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,798
Can you not see I'm
really upset about this?

169
00:12:55,974 --> 00:12:58,877
God, Veronica, please,
will you stop, okay?

170
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,310
He's going through, like,
a phase or something.

171
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:05,353
You two are meant for each
other. He's not that stupid.

172
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:12,321
- Fine, I'll talk to him.
- Thank you.

173
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,630
You know, I don't know what
you people would do without me.

174
00:13:18,744 --> 00:13:19,938
Is this a joke?

175
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:23,083
No, Mr. Echolls, this is detention.

176
00:13:23,517 --> 00:13:25,544
I meant the car.

177
00:13:27,524 --> 00:13:30,016
Oh, my God.

178
00:13:30,194 --> 00:13:32,061
It's not yours, is it?

179
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:37,133
Seriously, I don't think it's school
policy to have students do chores.

180
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:41,705
Seriously, would you like to hear the
school's policy on gambling, Mr. Echolls?

181
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,783
It's considerably detailed.

182
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,066
Hi, I'm looking for Sarah.

183
00:13:57,237 --> 00:14:00,971
Me too. She didn't show up today.

184
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:05,708
I'm her neighbor. She's been missing since
this morning. I'm getting really worried.

185
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:09,084
- You might check with her boyfriend, Andre.
- Do you know him?

186
00:14:09,257 --> 00:14:12,490
I feel like I do. She
talks about him ad nauseam.

187
00:14:12,663 --> 00:14:17,193
"He's such a brilliant artist. " "He's
so down-to-earth. " "He has magic hands."

188
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:19,673
I'm sensing you don't like him very much.

189
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:21,400
They fight all the time.

190
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:23,944
And I know for a fact
the guy's got a temper.

191
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,584
A couple weeks ago, she
spent the night at my place.

192
00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:30,616
It was storming out, she didn't wanna
drive. Andre absolutely flipped out.

193
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,353
They fought on the
phone like Sid and Nancy.

194
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:35,363
Thanks for the info.

195
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:39,026
This isn't like her. She hasn't missed
a day of work since she started here.

196
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,237
Do you know where I can find Andre?

197
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:44,675
Hello?

198
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,512
- What are you doing here?
- Have you seen Sarah?

199
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,978
Not since this morning. Why?

200
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:10,712
I was supposed to take her to the doctor
this morning, but she wasn't around.

201
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:14,223
- She didn't show up for work either.
- She'll turn up.

202
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:16,359
You're not concerned?

203
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:21,369
This is what she does. When things
get a little rough, she runs.

204
00:15:22,874 --> 00:15:25,174
What was the fight about?

205
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:28,773
I told her I found her friends annoying.

206
00:15:28,951 --> 00:15:32,719
Something about you telling
Sarah's mom she was pregnant.

207
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,417
Well, if you know the
answer, why ask the question?

208
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:37,655
Sarah's mom didn't know she was pregnant?

209
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:41,895
They hadn't spoken since Sarah left
Ohio. I told her that Sarah was pregnant.

210
00:15:42,072 --> 00:15:44,667
She said she wanted to come
be with her. Sarah freaked.

211
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:47,845
- Freaked and ran off.
- Yeah.

212
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:52,149
So get these dark
fantasies out of your head.

213
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:57,757
She'll come back as soon as she's
processed it all. It's her way.

214
00:15:58,431 --> 00:16:01,128
I heard a noise come from
your apartment last night.

215
00:16:01,302 --> 00:16:04,705
- A loud thump.
- Thump.

216
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:07,572
Must've been when I cracked
her head with a candlestick...

217
00:16:07,746 --> 00:16:11,047
and she crumpled to the ground. No, wait.

218
00:16:11,218 --> 00:16:14,986
- That was Professor Plum in the study.
- I am seriously worried.

219
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:18,424
You are seriously
paranoid, is what you are.

220
00:16:18,597 --> 00:16:22,831
I didn't hear a thump.
Maybe I slept through it.

221
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:26,505
Look, why don't you go back
to playing field hockey...

222
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:30,615
or whatever it is you usually do
after school. I can handle this.

223
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:34,778
Actually, what I usually do after school
is work at my dad's detective agency.

224
00:16:34,956 --> 00:16:37,085
You remember, he used to be sheriff.

225
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,695
He still has a ton of
contacts in law enforcement.

226
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:41,230
Well,
la-di-da.

227
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:46,167
Who's the girl?

228
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:49,710
She's the head of our
neighborhood-watch program.

229
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:05,864
I wasn't aware this
was clothing-optional.

230
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,272
Let me know when you're
ready for me, Picasso.

231
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:13,712
See you, neighbor. Thanks for dropping by.

232
00:17:25,303 --> 00:17:28,001
Dogs. Nature's psychic detectives.

233
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:30,974
They know it in their bones
when something is wrong.

234
00:17:31,146 --> 00:17:34,242
Now I've got the corroboration I need.

235
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:11,836
Hey, Killer.

236
00:19:42,855 --> 00:19:43,880
Killer?

237
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:48,558
Killer.

238
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:51,826
Killer, where are you, bud?

239
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:54,101
Oh, hi.

240
00:19:54,274 --> 00:19:56,266
What the hell are you
doing in my apartment?

241
00:19:56,443 --> 00:20:00,040
I couldn't study. The little guy was
barking his head off. I tried the door...

242
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:02,652
it was unlocked. So I
came in and checked on him.

243
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,755
I never leave my door unlocked.

244
00:20:04,924 --> 00:20:08,692
Oh, well, then Sarah must have
done it. That's possible, right?

245
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:12,359
Possible? Yeah, that's possible.

246
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:17,235
Look, I don't know who you think you are,
but you need to stay out of my business.

247
00:20:18,545 --> 00:20:21,573
- Am I being clear?
- Crystal.

248
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:24,880
Nice chatting with you.

249
00:20:41,682 --> 00:20:44,016
Well, we definitely don't need this one.

250
00:20:44,187 --> 00:20:46,622
I have no idea who this
is, so, what does that say?

251
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,124
Oh, perfect. We have
to have Doris Landers.

252
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:53,529
She was Class Sweetheart, in more
ways than one. But a very nice girl.

253
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:57,640
- What about Lianne Reynolds?
- Who?

254
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:59,504
She's my mom.

255
00:20:59,678 --> 00:21:03,275
Oh, my God. Of course, look at you.

256
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,479
I thought you looked familiar.
You look just like her. How is she?

257
00:21:07,658 --> 00:21:09,820
I love this picture of her.

258
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:17,830
Oh, she was just gorgeous. And
Jake. They were a beautiful couple.

259
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:21,342
- So they were a couple?
- No, they were the couple.

260
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:25,417
Very lovey-dovey. Practically
connected at the mouth in the hallway.

261
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,281
Everyone thought they'd get married.

262
00:21:27,455 --> 00:21:32,361
But everything worked out for the best.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here, right?

263
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,500
Right.

264
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:39,640
They were something, though,
like a couple in a movie.

265
00:21:40,543 --> 00:21:44,106
Aaron Stellman. I think he went to jail.

266
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,221
It's just high school. What
happens here doesn't mean anything.

267
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,056
I was part of a perfect couple.
It was part of my perfect life.

268
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,166
It's amazing how fleeting
perfection can be.

269
00:21:56,635 --> 00:21:58,831
Yesterday, you said we
were made for each other.

270
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:01,771
I don't... I really... I don't
wanna be in the middle of this.

271
00:22:01,944 --> 00:22:03,537
What is "this"?

272
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:06,878
- I think maybe you should just move on.
- What?

273
00:22:07,052 --> 00:22:08,953
I can think of a half-dozen guys...

274
00:22:09,122 --> 00:22:11,752
that would be a better
match for you than Duncan.

275
00:22:11,926 --> 00:22:13,792
What did he say? Did I do something?

276
00:22:13,963 --> 00:22:17,366
No, it's not you. It's just... He
needs some time alone for a while.

277
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:19,299
Would you stop walking?

278
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,765
What is so horrible
that you can't tell me?

279
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:23,675
Can you trust me?

280
00:22:24,346 --> 00:22:25,837
It's for the best, Veronica.

281
00:22:26,015 --> 00:22:28,986
I know that it doesn't seem
like it right now, but it is.

282
00:22:29,154 --> 00:22:30,850
You deserve better.

283
00:22:54,394 --> 00:22:56,659
Alphabetized by author, and then by title.

284
00:22:56,832 --> 00:23:00,895
For example, Shakespeare would come
after Poe, and before Wordsworth.

285
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:05,773
And then within Shakespeare,
Macbeth after Hamlet.

286
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:09,341
- Should I draw a diagram?
- Please. That would be helpful.

287
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:12,683
If you get this wrong, I'll
simply have you do it again.

288
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:19,698
Come on, amigo. Let's get to it, huh?

289
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:25,708
Heads up. My bad.

290
00:23:25,878 --> 00:23:29,873
You obviously have no
appreciation of literature.

291
00:23:32,388 --> 00:23:35,951
Would that it were Mr. Daniels' head.

292
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:40,122
I was thinking more like that
scene in Casino, with the Vise-Grip.

293
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,706
See, I'm more of a purist. You know,
less blood, more emotional distress.

294
00:23:44,874 --> 00:23:49,541
I'd rather see him locked in a room,
padded, crapping himself in the corner.

295
00:23:49,715 --> 00:23:52,914
You know, he's an English teacher,
he'd appreciate the poetic justice.

296
00:23:53,254 --> 00:23:56,089
I think I've got your poetic justice.

297
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:59,753
- Meaning?
- Meaning I've got a plan.

298
00:24:00,632 --> 00:24:02,157
Tick, tick, losing interest.

299
00:24:02,335 --> 00:24:05,602
If I thought you had the cojones
to pull it off, I'd tell you. But...

300
00:24:05,775 --> 00:24:10,305
Never underestimate
the size of my cojones.

301
00:24:27,743 --> 00:24:29,837
Where the...?

302
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,150
- You know how to get back to your hotel?
- Yeah.

303
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:37,188
I have one more thing.
Where do you think she is?

304
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:39,326
No idea.

305
00:24:39,495 --> 00:24:42,796
Look, I have your number at the
hotel, so if I hear anything...

306
00:24:43,868 --> 00:24:45,496
I'll give you a call.

307
00:24:45,871 --> 00:24:48,808
- Thank you.
- Sure.

308
00:24:56,589 --> 00:24:59,286
Excuse me. Are you Sarah's mother?

309
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:02,898
Yes. I'm Emily, and this
is her stepfather, Randall.

310
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,239
My father's a private detective, and he's
really good at finding missing people.

311
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:13,142
I can give you his card.

312
00:25:16,754 --> 00:25:19,349
- Come on, check it out.
- Thanks again for the ride, Lisa.

313
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:22,928
Let me know if you need
me to take you home.

314
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:25,891
Oh, jeez, what's the problem now?

315
00:25:32,713 --> 00:25:37,847
All right, people, break it up. Break
it up. What's the big attraction?

316
00:25:40,592 --> 00:25:41,924
Son of a...

317
00:25:54,647 --> 00:25:56,081
Son of a...

318
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,598
Get back to class.

319
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:09,396
Come on, move it! Go to class!

320
00:26:10,106 --> 00:26:11,938
Go to class, people!

321
00:26:16,582 --> 00:26:18,346
Mr. Navarro.

322
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,422
Interesting artwork you left
at the flagpole this morning.

323
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:26,189
Artwork? Looks to me like Mr. Daniels
has a little drinking-and-driving problem.

324
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:30,767
Spare me your indignation,
Mr. Navarro. We have a witness.

325
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:33,408
Yeah, sure you do.

326
00:26:41,022 --> 00:26:45,689
The only thing that's gonna make this easy
on you is if you tell us who helped you.

327
00:26:46,931 --> 00:26:48,695
All right.

328
00:26:48,868 --> 00:26:51,064
You guys wanna know who helped me?

329
00:26:51,238 --> 00:26:53,207
Ask your witness.

330
00:26:54,677 --> 00:26:56,669
You believe this?

331
00:26:57,348 --> 00:27:00,375
- Tell us who helped you!
- Tom.

332
00:27:00,553 --> 00:27:02,249
Easy.

333
00:27:02,423 --> 00:27:04,016
I've called your grandmother.

334
00:27:04,192 --> 00:27:10,430
She's been informed that, as of today,
you are expelled from Neptune High School.

335
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:17,572
- You are no longer a student here.
- And you had so much potential.

336
00:27:18,147 --> 00:27:22,051
Okay, then, a security guard will
escort you to clean out your locker.

337
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,087
Wait.

338
00:27:24,658 --> 00:27:28,221
Does this mean I can't try
out for the soccer team?

339
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,932
I didn't know they expelled
people at our school.

340
00:27:33,105 --> 00:27:35,734
Well, not our people.

341
00:27:36,076 --> 00:27:39,377
- They expelled him?
- Security escorted him off the grounds.

342
00:27:39,548 --> 00:27:43,850
I was in the office changing my schedule.
You could hear Daniels just blowing a fuse.

343
00:27:44,022 --> 00:27:47,791
You know, "Tell us who helped
you! Tell us who helped you!"

344
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:52,825
If he starts selling oranges in front
of my house, I'm gonna be pissed.

345
00:27:59,814 --> 00:28:05,187
She was a very sweet girl.
Lighthearted. An angel.

346
00:28:05,356 --> 00:28:09,796
And then, around her
senior year, I saw a change.

347
00:28:09,964 --> 00:28:11,899
She was secretive...

348
00:28:12,534 --> 00:28:15,596
always picking fights with me.

349
00:28:16,073 --> 00:28:18,066
Thank you.

350
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:23,013
I think she was angry because I
remarried after her father died.

351
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:28,648
I don't know, she had a knack for
attracting troubled, young men.

352
00:28:28,827 --> 00:28:32,230
Come on, Emily, you make
her sound worse than she was.

353
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,061
She was a teenager. They have moods.

354
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:37,597
We shouldn't kid ourselves, Randall.

355
00:28:37,774 --> 00:28:40,836
Then one day, last year, she took off.

356
00:28:41,013 --> 00:28:43,677
Didn't finish high school.
Never even said goodbye.

357
00:28:43,851 --> 00:28:46,447
Emily, she's only been
gone a couple of days.

358
00:28:46,622 --> 00:28:50,082
We'll find her. That's why we're here.

359
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:54,066
I'll do my best.

360
00:28:56,538 --> 00:28:58,769
So here's what I'm thinking:

361
00:28:58,941 --> 00:29:02,276
The boyfriend, Andre, he knows something.

362
00:29:02,447 --> 00:29:04,814
If we lean on him, put
the fear of God in him...

363
00:29:04,985 --> 00:29:07,750
Veronica, I'm handling
this case from here on out.

364
00:29:09,191 --> 00:29:11,217
I brought them here so
you could be involved.

365
00:29:11,394 --> 00:29:15,458
- And I'm handling this case without you.
- No. Dad, she's my friend.

366
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:19,300
No, she's a girl you talked to in
the laundry room from time to time.

367
00:29:19,874 --> 00:29:23,404
Look, sweetie, young, attractive
girls who take up with troubled men...

368
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:26,107
disappear without warning...

369
00:29:26,652 --> 00:29:31,490
I've handled a hundred of these cases
in my life, and they often end badly.

370
00:29:32,095 --> 00:29:34,291
Prepare yourself.

371
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:51,551
I convinced Dad to let me keep working
on the case if I stayed away from Andre.

372
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:53,284
Hi. This is Sarah Williams.

373
00:29:53,461 --> 00:29:56,762
I'm just wondering if I can get
my test results over the phone.

374
00:29:56,933 --> 00:30:00,667
Right, the DNA test. Could you
explain to me what that means?

375
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,639
Sarah's baby, it wasn't Andre's.

376
00:30:08,018 --> 00:30:12,424
- You got a sec?
- Mr. Echolls. What can I do for you?

377
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:17,298
Man, I tell you, Mr.
Clemmons, I am pissed off.

378
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:21,064
I need for you to use appropriate
language in here, Mr. Echolls.

379
00:30:23,643 --> 00:30:25,943
Now, what's got under your skin?

380
00:30:26,114 --> 00:30:28,777
It's that Weevil kid.

381
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:32,218
- He is no longer a student here.
- Yeah, I know.

382
00:30:32,391 --> 00:30:34,792
But the problem is, he's
getting all the credit...

383
00:30:34,961 --> 00:30:37,727
for sticking Mr. Daniels'
car on the flagpole.

384
00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:41,701
Now, all of a sudden, he's,
like, the biggest badass in...

385
00:30:41,872 --> 00:30:45,071
Rad dude here at Neptune.

386
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:48,147
People are gonna be talking
about that punking for years.

387
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:52,319
- I don't think I understand.
- I mean, I want my share of the credit.

388
00:30:52,489 --> 00:30:55,254
You're confessing to helping Eli Navarro?

389
00:30:55,727 --> 00:30:58,061
You can't just get away
with this, young man.

390
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:00,030
Yeah, I didn't think I could.

391
00:31:06,678 --> 00:31:09,672
So, what kind of punishment
are we talking about?

392
00:31:15,092 --> 00:31:17,323
I'm not really
understanding your question.

393
00:31:17,495 --> 00:31:21,662
Well, if Andre's not the baby's
father, do you know who is?

394
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:24,237
It's not mine, if that's
what you're suggesting.

395
00:31:24,407 --> 00:31:27,070
No, I'm not, but you
work with her every day.

396
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:30,147
- You might have picked up something.
- I hate to think this...

397
00:31:30,316 --> 00:31:34,049
but maybe the guy that raped
her is the baby's father.

398
00:31:34,222 --> 00:31:36,419
- She was raped?
- Yeah.

399
00:31:36,593 --> 00:31:40,497
It's one of the reasons that she left
her hometown and followed Andre here.

400
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,702
- She told you that?
- Yeah.

401
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:47,407
Like you said, we spend
a lot of time together.

402
00:31:48,412 --> 00:31:50,847
- Did she say who it was?
- Never.

403
00:31:51,015 --> 00:31:55,819
I should get back to work. But if I think of
anything else, I'll be sure to give you a call.

404
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:10,408
You stole the diary.

405
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:13,510
- What?
- How did that work?

406
00:32:13,685 --> 00:32:17,282
She was sleeping at your house that
stormy night, and there it was...

407
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:22,023
just poking out of her bag. You had to
find out if she had a thing for you too.

408
00:32:23,768 --> 00:32:25,293
You realize you're paranoid.

409
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:28,433
I do. Everyone reminds me.

410
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:32,809
But it doesn't mean I'm not right. I want
the journal. It's gonna help me find her.

411
00:32:32,982 --> 00:32:34,883
I told you, I don't have it.

412
00:32:37,757 --> 00:32:41,661
- Looks like we're in a bit of a standstill.
- Looks that way.

413
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:44,233
Excuse me.

414
00:32:50,744 --> 00:32:54,341
Hey. It's Veronica. Hear you
have some free time on your hands.

415
00:32:54,517 --> 00:32:56,509
You wanna do me a little favor?

416
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,008
- We heard there was a sale.
- Yeah.

417
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,908
Everything's on clearance.

418
00:33:35,783 --> 00:33:37,843
- What do you guys want?
- I don't know.

419
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:40,250
Sometimes girls get put
off by this old jacket.

420
00:33:40,423 --> 00:33:44,886
Do you think something in suede
might make me seem more accessible?

421
00:33:48,603 --> 00:33:50,664
Could you...? Could
you please not do that?

422
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,503
Yo, W, it looks like the
new Prada line came in.

423
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:58,484
Guys.

424
00:33:58,652 --> 00:34:01,680
Remember, no white after Labor Day.

425
00:34:04,829 --> 00:34:07,857
Nathan, did you happen
to find that journal?

426
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,160
What the hell?

427
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,170
- You going somewhere?
- What's it to you?

428
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:02,252
Strange time to take a trip,
with your girlfriend missing.

429
00:35:02,821 --> 00:35:07,022
- And how is this your business?
- I was hired by her parents to find her.

430
00:35:07,195 --> 00:35:11,065
Something tells me they wouldn't be keen
on the idea of you skipping town right now.

431
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:15,401
Well, that's just it, pal, I'm not skipping
town. I'm just dropping off a friend.

432
00:35:15,575 --> 00:35:17,840
- Track number three. All aboard.

433
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,747
Can I go? They're boarding now.

434
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:25,356
I appreciate you humoring
me. Go catch your train.

435
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:31,595
- I'll be right here waiting for you.
- Well, I'll be right back.

436
00:35:32,535 --> 00:35:36,998
I'd like to take this opportunity to remind
you both that you're getting off easy.

437
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:40,313
This will go on your permanent
record, but you're fortunate...

438
00:35:40,481 --> 00:35:43,350
that you're not being
suspended or expelled.

439
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,152
Does it go on my permanent
record that I was un-expelled?

440
00:35:48,327 --> 00:35:50,660
Don't push your luck, Eli.

441
00:35:58,711 --> 00:36:00,976
I'll take this one.

442
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:12,325
- Hey, man, what are you doing?
- Hey, what the hell is that?

443
00:36:12,499 --> 00:36:16,267
- It's my arm, dog.
- Why do you have Lilly's name on your arm?

444
00:36:16,438 --> 00:36:17,997
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.

445
00:36:18,174 --> 00:36:21,373
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah, I really wanna know!

446
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:25,879
Lilly's my little sister's name, man.

447
00:36:26,755 --> 00:36:29,089
That okay with you?

448
00:36:33,332 --> 00:36:35,825
Put your hands on me again,
you'll lose one of them.

449
00:36:36,003 --> 00:36:38,404
Yeah, I think I just peed myself.

450
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,220
If you keep a diary, you have
to consider the possibility...

451
00:36:50,392 --> 00:36:54,195
that someone could find it and be
privy to your every intimate secret.

452
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:58,600
At least, that's what I told myself as
I pored through Sarah's private thoughts.

453
00:36:58,772 --> 00:37:03,269
There were no details of the
sexual assault, only its aftermath.

454
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:16,196
Sarah didn't handle it well. She
felt she couldn't talk to her mother.

455
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,497
She couldn't relate to her
friends. She ran away from home...

456
00:37:19,673 --> 00:37:21,904
and started sleeping in her car.

457
00:37:30,223 --> 00:37:31,953
Bingo.

458
00:37:36,032 --> 00:37:37,967
The one bright spot was Andre.

459
00:37:38,135 --> 00:37:41,573
She met him in an art class
and followed him to Neptune.

460
00:37:44,446 --> 00:37:46,381
Sarah?

461
00:37:49,854 --> 00:37:53,257
- You found me.
- Everyone's worried about you.

462
00:37:54,327 --> 00:37:58,664
- Are my parents here?
- Yeah, they're back at the apartment.

463
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,664
I'm gonna miss all this.

464
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:16,157
- I found her.
- I know.

465
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,760
Word's out in the complex.
I'm very impressed.

466
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:23,499
- Think I've got a future in the biz?
- You've got a future as a highly paid...

467
00:38:23,675 --> 00:38:26,407
Ivy League-educated
executive of some sort...

468
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:30,950
who never thinks about private
investigation again in her perfect life.

469
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,286
Now, let's do something normal
fathers and daughters do.

470
00:38:35,961 --> 00:38:38,796
- Buy me a pony?
- I was thinking I'd watch TV...

471
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:42,904
and you'd rub my feet.
- Yeah, that's normal.

472
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:50,812
- Have you seen my keys?
- You're not leaving, are you?

473
00:38:50,985 --> 00:38:54,047
No, Sarah, I'm not the
one who's always running.

474
00:38:54,223 --> 00:38:57,490
Look, I spent the past two hours
making small talk with your parents.

475
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:02,532
- They didn't come 2000 miles to see me.
- I told you, I don't wanna deal with them.

476
00:39:02,703 --> 00:39:05,970
Yeah, well, you're gonna have
to deal with them sometime.

477
00:39:06,142 --> 00:39:09,841
- You're right.
- I'm gonna take Killer for a walk.

478
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:14,079
- I'll be right back. I love you.
- I love you too.

479
00:39:15,557 --> 00:39:18,790
Come here, buddy. Come on.

480
00:39:25,874 --> 00:39:30,177
I have to say, I still
really don't trust Andre.

481
00:39:31,249 --> 00:39:32,774
I don't know.

482
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:37,516
I mean, he knows about the DNA
test, that the baby's not his.

483
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:40,228
And he said it didn't matter.

484
00:39:41,098 --> 00:39:44,866
Which, in itself, is
all sorts of freakish.

485
00:39:45,906 --> 00:39:48,968
Or it's a testament to
how much he loves her.

486
00:39:49,344 --> 00:39:51,472
A man's gotta be pretty
committed to a woman...

487
00:39:51,648 --> 00:39:54,483
to agree to raise another man's child.

488
00:39:55,822 --> 00:39:58,451
Do you know who the real father is?

489
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,527
Hello? Earth to Mars.

490
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,465
What?

491
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:10,568
- Where did you go just now?
- Nowhere. What did you just ask me?

492
00:40:10,745 --> 00:40:12,680
Who the father is.

493
00:40:13,649 --> 00:40:15,642
Oh, Sarah.

494
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,818
What's wrong?

495
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,856
Mom, there's something you should know.

496
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,690
- Why didn't you tell me she was raped?
- I just found out.

497
00:40:22,865 --> 00:40:27,031
- He raped me! He raped me!
- These are lies! You are a liar!

498
00:40:27,204 --> 00:40:30,734
- Why are you trying to hurt me?
- Shut up and listen to me for once!

499
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:33,244
Your husband raped me!

500
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,144
Just stay here.

501
00:40:40,226 --> 00:40:43,163
- No, I'm done keeping quiet.
- That's enough.

502
00:40:43,331 --> 00:40:45,528
- Sarah.
- You're not gonna hurt me again.

503
00:40:46,003 --> 00:40:48,495
- Oh, no.
- Open up!

504
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:54,345
Randall! No!

505
00:41:02,362 --> 00:41:04,354
I'm so sorry!

506
00:41:31,008 --> 00:41:32,636
- How is she?
- She's resting.

507
00:41:32,811 --> 00:41:35,007
She's gonna be okay.

508
00:41:35,648 --> 00:41:37,982
So I guess I'm grounded.

509
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:44,055
I'm gonna let you slide on this one.

510
00:41:46,633 --> 00:41:48,966
But can I let myself slide?

511
00:41:49,136 --> 00:41:52,666
Sure, the real tragedy happened
long before I came along.

512
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,005
I just brought it to the surface.

513
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,083
But are some things better left buried?
