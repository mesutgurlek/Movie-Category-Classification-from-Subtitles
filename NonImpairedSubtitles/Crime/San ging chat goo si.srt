You vomitted last week in my car, and it spend me 3-4 hours to wash it.

4
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:17,037
Your $15 deal was not worth of that.

5
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:16,761
Help! It's not my business... Let me alone.

6
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:19,196

00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:00,796
Good, I promise you

23
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:03,236
Why have reporters not arrive yet?

24
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:06,756

00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:14,956
Excuse me.

28
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:16,599

29
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:18,036
Eric Chow,come out!

30
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:21,684
You are a vampire, you forced me into stockjobbing

31
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:24,157
Promised me that it was profitable, and there would be no accident.

32
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:25,999
Instigate me to peculate the money of companey.

33
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:28,800
Want me to compensate my life to you...

00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:31,124

35
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:34,879
Eric Chow, you son of a gun ,come out!
How long still will you hide?

36
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:44,036
Do not come over, calm down, put down your hand!

37
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:46,039
Stay back everyone and don't move forward! Don't mishandle!

38
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:07,962
Chan Sir! Save the hostage!

39
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:14,636

40
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:25,281
There! Quick!

41
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:41,482
Chen Sir, It doesn't matter?

42
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:43,000
No matter, disperse the crowd first

43
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:44,716
Go!

44
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,883
Remember to repay my debt!

45
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:51,002
Caption Chen, thanks...

46
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:52,156
That man is crazy

47
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:54,961
If no one loses in stocks, who would win?

48
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:57,198
What's more, indict him for 2-3 more sins.

49
00:05:57,487 --> 00:05:59,717
Put him into jail, Let him reflect on his sins.

50
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,641
if everyone is like him, I would have nothing to do.
Isn't it right?

51
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:04,436
Who are you?

52
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:06,201
Just now you were looking for me everywhere.

53
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,716
My name is Eric Chow

54
00:06:08,927 --> 00:06:10,326
If you want to do stockjobbing, come to me.

55
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:19,678
Why do you still stand byy? Take all the proof back.

56
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:21,002
Yes!I will help you.

57
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:22,606
Brother-in-law, fortunately you wore two pieces of bullet-proof.

58
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:41,161
Look at you. Because you have winned several prizes

59
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:42,915
Everyone become proudhearted.

60
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:45,486
Do you guys really think we are no 1 of the police?

61
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:49,198
Chao, you two were taking charge for controlling the atmosphere,

62
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:52,039
How could you let a group of person surround?

63
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:56,127
Original only one hostage,
But then the reporters all became the hostages.

64
00:06:56,607 --> 00:06:58,962
If gangster shot, many would fall down.

65
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:02,365
Where the atmosphere controlling you?
Or you controlling the atmosphere?

66
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,919
The Akang, come here.

67
00:07:08,807 --> 00:07:10,638
How could you let the gangster pull out the gun more quickly than you?

68
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:13,277
Haven't I taught you to how to pull out the gun?
Now show that for me.

69
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:20,283
Your clothes blocked the gun.

70
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,479
Each time when you change the clothes,
your pocket is always filled with small changes or keys.

71
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:35,243
Put a lucky stone in the pocket.

72
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:38,002
Remember what your future brother-in-law's words, become more bright.

73
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:39,356
I know, sister.

74
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:41,321
Go out for a meal?

75
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:44,117
Good...Have a meal...

76
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,600
Chen,you seem to still have not talked to me today.

77
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:50,796
What?

78
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:54,283
What?
Which birthday you have talked to them.

79
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:56,762
No need to talk about it.

80
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,642
Happy birthday, take it youself.

81
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:15,796
Open the safe-deposit box.

82
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:17,646
Open the safe-deposit box!

83
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,236
My job for them.

84
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,446
Feel very great this time.

85
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:33,436
Have the telephone?

86
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,156

87
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:39,722
Call the police

88
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:42,676
Call the police!

89
00:11:09,607 --> 00:11:14,158
I just work for them, it's not my business...

90
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:17,041

91
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:37,356
Police!Put down the gun!

92
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,286
Headquarter, here firepower is very fierce...

00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:52,405
Three... Four...

94
00:11:53,327 --> 00:11:54,726
Three... Four...

00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:58,116

00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,843
Five...Six...

97
00:12:22,447 --> 00:12:24,961
What are you doing?

98
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:26,636
Calm down!

99
00:13:08,727 --> 00:13:09,716
Don't move!

100
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:12,116
Put down the gun!

101
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:14,196
Put down the gun!

102
00:13:18,327 --> 00:13:19,476
Take a look at your the back.

103
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:24,196
Safe.

104
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:58,477
A Jian, A Jian

105
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,323
Tonight the asia bank is under robbing,
Five bandits use ...

106
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:11,239
Everyone listen,A Zu 100 decis,

108
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:15,556
The result announced.

109
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:19,921
Beat police, 20 decis
If officer or super, 30 decis

110
00:14:20,407 --> 00:14:22,079
Beat the police wagon, 10 decis

111
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,443
1 decis 1,000,000, the superfluous is confiscated.

112
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:28,644
But Sue, if you drop the cabbage,
you will be decreased 200 decis

113
00:14:29,407 --> 00:14:32,444
How could be that!You all didn' help me
How could you be bashful to say that.

114
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:37,796
Do not quarrel for so little cabbage, the cabbage is important.

115
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:44,919
Sue, if you lose again the next time, you will get nothing.

116
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:46,964
After the fact, the police convenes the press conference

117
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:51,435
Senior Inspector Chen Guo Rong take over this affair formally
Here is his express:

118
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:53,396
Three hours!

119
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,924
The police has the enough reliance to catch these bandits in three hours.

120
00:14:57,247 --> 00:14:58,919
Through the abearance that they challenge the police

121
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,602
I believe that they are babyish sheep without a shepherd.

122
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:03,441
I promise to everyone...

123
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:06,486
The police will certainly catch those bandits.

124
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:17,795
Is that OK?

125
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:19,476
Brother Sen.

126
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:21,636
Almost payed.

127
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:26,877
I really want to get out of the hospital quickly, to catch those bantits myself.

128
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:29,442
Don't worry, tonight we will catch all of them.

129
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:31,876
Do you have any clues?

130
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:34,198
My informant have found the place where they hide.

131
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:41,165
They are forethought very obviously,
They take the police to be their target intentionally.

132
00:15:42,087 --> 00:15:43,679
A Rong , call Special Duty Unit

133
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:46,925
Do you know me just now today?
I am from Special Duty Unit.

134
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:48,476
Don't worry, Brother Sen.

135
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:51,326
Our buddies are much stronger than Special Duty Unit

136
00:15:52,047 --> 00:15:54,481
Yes ...

137
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:05,081
A Sen, Finance company
Appoint a few hoods to your office today

138
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:10,524
Don't worry, I will take the debt back, take it easy.

139
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:13,122
That will be OK, If you have any trouble, tell me.

140
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,920
I will do anything I can do to help you.

141
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:16,556
I know.

142
00:16:17,607 --> 00:16:18,596
A Rong...

143
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:24,241
Never be mercy when confronting those gangsters.

144
00:16:25,327 --> 00:16:26,316
They are crazy.

145
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:30,684
Can escape out to have a drink with metonight?

146
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,839
Tomorrow if have nothing to do,I will return to police station to recognize the suspect.

147
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:37,160
A Rong,Your reliance is what I am in most admiration of.

148
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:39,400
You'd better abstain gambling after you leave hospital.

149
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:26,285
Chen Sir, you are relax in the car,
Let me take it.

150
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:28,244
You guy, want to be upgraded?

151
00:17:28,287 --> 00:17:29,163
Why not?

152
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:30,959
Hurry up, there's a dinner party tonight.

153
00:17:31,407 --> 00:17:32,442
Me too.

154
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:34,444
I'll go traveling tomorrow, and I haven't do the packing.

155
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:35,960
Sir, let me do it.

156
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:37,276
Hey, guy, save some of your strength.

157
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:38,556
When's your turn?

158
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:41,159
Don't kid and don't be cute.

159
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:42,806
Let the same things talked at the dinner party.

160
00:17:43,287 --> 00:17:44,959
Divide into 2 teams,
Team A go ahead first.

161
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:46,556
Yes, sir!

162
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:26,876

Be careful.

164

Somebody's there. Watch out!

165
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:58,241
Don't move, if not, I'll shoot! Don't move!

166
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:18,276
Divide into Team A & B,
Let two people left here.

167
00:19:18,447 --> 00:19:19,436
I see.

168
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:30,285
Come on, game starts.

169
00:19:37,287 --> 00:19:38,276
What's the matter?

170
00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:39,396
Don't be nervous.

171
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:48,200
Chen Sir...

172
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:49,716
Have you receieved yet, Tian Ming?

173
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:54,202
I can't hear Chen Sir...

174
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:55,356
Tian Ming!

175
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:56,996
Rick!

176
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:09,127
A Hai, stay and guard here, don't leave!

177
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:10,276
Yes, Sir!

178
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:11,556
Follow, AKang

179
00:20:23,127 --> 00:20:25,197
Where are those shits?

180
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:28,756
Retreat!

181
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:46,076
Stop!

182
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,478
Tian Ming, Fire!

183
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:01,441
Be quick!

184
00:21:04,487 --> 00:21:05,476
There are some gun shots sound.

185
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:34,076
Where are those shits?

186
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,116
Don't quarrell with each other!

187
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:36,756
Hold out!

188
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:09,282
Brother Guang...

189
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:12,043
Chen Sir...

190
00:22:13,727 --> 00:22:14,716
Be calm.

191
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:29,716
There's someone...

192
00:22:30,847 --> 00:22:31,836
Akang, don't pursue him!

193
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:35,476
Akang

194
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:38,396
Don't pursue him.

195
00:22:53,847 --> 00:22:54,996
Akang!

196
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:12,766
Help me, Chen Sir!

197
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:38,556
Brother-in-law...

198
00:23:39,847 --> 00:23:42,600
Akang...Akang! Brother-in-law...

199
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:44,359
Akang! Don't die!

200
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:30,396
How things could be like this?

201
00:24:34,727 --> 00:24:35,876
Help me...

202
00:24:36,847 --> 00:24:39,122
How the hell are you?

203
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:42,245
Come out! Why?

204
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:51,362
It's not because you are strong that you still alive.

205
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:53,000
It's because we haven't tortured you enough that we leave alive.

206
00:24:53,687 --> 00:24:54,676
Who the hell are you?

207
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:57,797
I'm the one hates you such police very much.

208
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:03,036
Release him!

209
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:04,725
You put down the gun first!

210
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:05,956
Release him!

211
00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:13,796
No!

212
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:15,678
Well done!

213
00:25:20,807 --> 00:25:23,605
Tian Zhao! Tian Zhao!

214
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:27,437
I won't say the same words to you twice.

215
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:31,756
What on earth you want to do?

216
00:25:32,127 --> 00:25:33,560
Just play with you!

217
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:37,835
It seems that you're the shooting champion
in your police station, right?

218
00:25:38,047 --> 00:25:42,120
You're good at guns best.  So I'd like to
compete you with putting the pistol parts together.

219
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:43,436
OK

220
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:49,556
How to play?

221
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:53,202
These two are your mates' pistols.

222
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:57,158
Let's seem who finishes putting
the pistol parts together first.

223
00:25:57,727 --> 00:25:58,716
I'll bet with you!

224
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:06,246
OK

225
00:26:07,247 --> 00:26:10,284
Ready! One...

226
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:13,880
Two...

227
00:26:14,127 --> 00:26:15,116
Three!

228
00:26:24,487 --> 00:26:27,399
Help me ... Brother-in-law

229
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:41,405
You lose!

230
00:26:43,247 --> 00:26:44,885
Please don't

231
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:49,319
What else you want to play with?

232
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,795
It's my turn.

233
00:26:57,647 --> 00:26:59,285
Yor're the free-style fighting coach
in the police station, right?

234
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:04,045
I want to fight with you.
And let's see who falls on to the round first!

235
00:27:05,447 --> 00:27:06,436
I'll bet with you!

236
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:09,996
OK

237
00:27:10,927 --> 00:27:12,758
Ready ... Start!

238
00:27:39,087 --> 00:27:40,315
Byebye!

239
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:42,796
Please Don't!

240
00:27:43,847 --> 00:27:45,326
You lose again!

241
00:27:49,527 --> 00:27:50,926
Kill me, please!

242
00:27:51,727 --> 00:27:52,876
You always think you're so great, right?

243
00:27:53,327 --> 00:27:55,795
And You've said that you would catch me within three hours.

244
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:59,598
You don't behave the same compared to the TV.

245
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:02,283
Please release him!

246
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:03,516
Kneel!

247
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:11,885
Kowtow!

248
00:28:13,287 --> 00:28:16,836
I beg you, please release them!

249
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:19,478
OK, I'll give you another chance.

250
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:22,562
The same rules as before.

251
00:28:23,647 --> 00:28:24,636
Come on!

252
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:30,276
OK!

253
00:28:31,607 --> 00:28:32,926
I'll bet with you for four.

254
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:36,398
All right!

255
00:28:36,687 --> 00:28:37,676
OK

256
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:40,557
Ready ... Start!

257
00:29:00,887 --> 00:29:01,876
Well done!

258
00:29:04,727 --> 00:29:08,766
What a pity. Three seconds overtime.
With one second, one man to be killed.

259
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:10,841
OK!

260
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,806
No!

261
00:29:16,527 --> 00:29:18,404
Please don't

262
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,245
Why!

263
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:37,883
Brother-in-law ... go away from here.

264
00:29:38,047 --> 00:29:39,765
Akang, hold out!

265
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:44,563
Don't kill him now, he's still some kind of usage.

266
00:30:39,807 --> 00:30:43,402
Akang! Akang...

267
00:30:43,647 --> 00:30:44,796
Wake up Akang...

268
00:30:45,247 --> 00:30:46,919
Nothing serious! Hold out!

269
00:30:47,607 --> 00:30:50,167
Save the people ... there's a bomb

270
00:30:57,967 --> 00:31:00,037
Akang, hold out! I'll lead you out!

271
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:40,285
I'll lead you out!

272
00:35:01,847 --> 00:35:02,836
Somebody's snatching me!

273
00:35:03,007 --> 00:35:03,996
Thief!

274
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:10,162
Get away, don't stand here.

275
00:35:10,607 --> 00:35:11,676
Get out!

276
00:35:12,687 --> 00:35:15,281
Get out! Get out!

277
00:35:18,447 --> 00:35:20,244
Get out! Drunkard!

278
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,276
Wallet!

279
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:28,116
He's a policeman.

280
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:31,523
Policeman? Give you a kick! Go!

281
00:36:22,927 --> 00:36:27,921
Hey, borther, there are still many things
waiting for you to fulfill.

282
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:33,567
Forget the past, and turn your sorrow into strength.

283
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:04,796
Who are you?

284
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:07,237
Police code 1667, report to you, Chen Sir!

285
00:37:07,527 --> 00:37:08,721
I'm your new partener, Zheng Xiaofeng.

286
00:37:09,647 --> 00:37:10,636
I don't need a partener.

287
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:14,206
I have applied for a one-year-vacation.

288
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:18,086
Officer Dai told me that your vacation
has been cancelled from now on.

289
00:37:21,127 --> 00:37:22,276
Don't touch my things.

290
00:37:22,847 --> 00:37:25,202
To tell you the truth,
your home can't be further untider.

291
00:37:25,887 --> 00:37:28,799
Today's service attitude can be like this.

292
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:32,596
To change you should change you life style first.

293
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:36,084
In other words, throw these unuseful things.

294
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,278
Only from this, can help you find what you want.

295
00:37:38,487 --> 00:37:40,239
You're so irritated, give me a cup of water first.

296
00:37:40,447 --> 00:37:42,165
No water, but your girlfriend has just come here.

297
00:37:42,247 --> 00:37:44,238
Leave me an important thing to give you.

298
00:37:44,447 --> 00:37:45,846
A ring.

299
00:37:52,447 --> 00:37:55,280
Get out here!

300
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:57,206
I won't leave here unless I've told you everything, sir.

301
00:37:58,687 --> 00:37:59,836
Can you wait till I'm finished?

302
00:38:03,207 --> 00:38:04,196
OK

303
00:38:06,647 --> 00:38:10,083
The guys that robbed The Bank of Asia three months ago have made their move again

304
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:12,166
I've lost many men

305
00:38:12,727 --> 00:38:14,843
Tai Sir says that you are gonna take charge of this case on your own

306
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:19,515
There are tens of thousands of cops in Hong Kong
Why me?

307
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:23,201
How should I know...It's hard to say

308
00:38:24,287 --> 00:38:27,518
Those guys are insane
They are not doing it for money

309
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:29,485
and,lately...

310
00:38:30,327 --> 00:38:33,524
There's a new game on the internet
in the name of your case

311
00:38:34,727 --> 00:38:37,321
I doubt that they are using PC games ...

312
00:38:38,087 --> 00:38:40,806
Don't talk about this case with me again,Go!

313
00:38:41,607 --> 00:38:43,040
Get Out! Go!
Listen to me,Sir

314
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:44,956
Get Out!

315
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:57,840
Chen Sir,it's me

316
00:39:58,327 --> 00:39:59,555
You again?
Leave me alone

317
00:40:01,127 --> 00:40:03,038
I'm at your girlfriend's home

318
00:40:03,327 --> 00:40:04,362
Her home?Anything wrong?

319
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:07,365
Yeah,of course

320
00:40:08,127 --> 00:40:09,116
What's wrong with her?

321
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:10,481
Why would I be calling you if there's nothing wrong?

322
00:40:10,647 --> 00:40:11,682
How is she?

323
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:13,556
You'd better hurry

324
00:40:13,727 --> 00:40:14,796
Don't leave
I'll be right there

325
00:40:21,607 --> 00:40:22,596
Smells good!

326
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,484
Even better if you add some olive oil

327
00:40:24,767 --> 00:40:25,756
Try it

328
00:40:25,847 --> 00:40:26,836
Be careful

329
00:40:31,047 --> 00:40:32,036
OK

330
00:40:32,087 --> 00:40:33,076
Sure

331
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:34,436
I gave the ring to him

332
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:37,923
He was shocked at the sight of it

333
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:40,165
Actually,he cares about you a lot

334
00:40:40,727 --> 00:40:43,525
But when it comes to that case,he just can't get over himself

335
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:10,837
Hi...who's this?

336
00:41:13,887 --> 00:41:16,606
Hello...

337
00:41:17,247 --> 00:41:18,362
Why don't you come in?

338
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:29,676
Come and sit

339
00:41:31,127 --> 00:41:32,606
What are you doing here?

340
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:39,964
I've done what you told me
Now you wanna dump me?

341
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:50,125
You made me buy it
that's two hundred

342
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:51,965
And for poking my eyes,five hundred

343
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:55,920
I thought you forgot

344
00:42:10,607 --> 00:42:13,246
Chen Sir picked up the cake
and I'm in charge of express

345
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:35,004
Happy Birthday...

346
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:39,958
Happy Birthday...

347
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:50,521
Happy Birthday

348
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:00,605
It's a good day,Smile

349
00:43:06,447 --> 00:43:10,759
You are supposed to make a wish
and blow the candles

350
00:43:24,327 --> 00:43:27,319
I...forgot to close the door

351
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:31,956
Come and sit

352
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:50,645
Things will get cold if you don't eat them

353
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:56,756
What are you writing?

354
00:44:00,367 --> 00:44:01,356
Nothing

355
00:44:03,447 --> 00:44:04,641
I know what you are writing

356
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:06,836
"sorry"?

357
00:44:20,207 --> 00:44:21,196
Why didn't you throw it away?

358
00:44:25,887 --> 00:44:27,036
Why?

359
00:44:28,247 --> 00:44:32,445
Even though the things are gone
but the memory will remain.

360
00:44:38,447 --> 00:44:40,119
I know you won't forgive me

361
00:44:41,927 --> 00:44:43,406
That's what you think

362
00:44:44,887 --> 00:44:48,766
I'm a nurse
I've been thinking all day that...

363
00:44:49,447 --> 00:44:52,120
Is there a cure for missing someone?

364
00:44:52,727 --> 00:44:53,716
What do you think?

365
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:57,122
Yes

366
00:44:58,927 --> 00:45:00,485
To see the one that you miss

367
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:05,880
What if I can't?

368
00:45:15,487 --> 00:45:18,479
If you can't,then as time goes by...

369
00:45:19,727 --> 00:45:21,399
it'll become memory

370
00:45:23,047 --> 00:45:24,241
I see

371
00:45:27,407 --> 00:45:29,318
I can't forgive myself

372
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:46,365
What's the use of drinking?

373
00:45:47,007 --> 00:45:51,478
You are destroying yourself
and retaliating your dissatisfaction with the society

374
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:55,120
At the end,
the only one that'll be destroyed is yourself

375
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:59,443
In other words
you should catch them as early as you can

376
00:46:00,047 --> 00:46:03,323
Otherwise
what are you gonna say to your men?

377
00:46:07,687 --> 00:46:10,281
I've helped you to do a lot of work

378
00:46:11,127 --> 00:46:15,279
I think these guys are not robbing for money
they...

379
00:46:17,887 --> 00:46:20,560
Can you hear me out?

380
00:46:21,207 --> 00:46:23,596
I've found out their exact details
I'm very sure that...

381
00:46:23,927 --> 00:46:24,996
they must revel in PC games

382
00:46:25,247 --> 00:46:27,636
and their weapons,guns,bombs

383
00:46:28,047 --> 00:46:29,719
are all from Europe
which is to say...

384
00:46:30,047 --> 00:46:31,685
those aren't cheap
they must be rich

385
00:46:35,287 --> 00:46:36,515
You can go home

386
00:46:37,287 --> 00:46:38,276
Robbery!Over there!

387
00:46:38,327 --> 00:46:39,362
Robbery!

388
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:41,156
Police!  Freeze!

389
00:46:41,367 --> 00:46:42,356
Robbery!

390
00:46:55,207 --> 00:46:56,196
Poke and pry?

391
00:46:58,967 --> 00:47:00,764
Hit him!
To hell with him!

392
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:14,035
No...

393
00:47:14,487 --> 00:47:16,682
Get away! Wake up! Get them!

394
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:19,396
Inspector Wing,you are a cop!

395
00:47:22,447 --> 00:47:25,245
You again,get away!

396
00:47:26,247 --> 00:47:27,999
You wanna get hit?

397
00:47:28,687 --> 00:47:33,158
Get away! You are a cop

398
00:47:40,087 --> 00:47:41,076
It hurts...

399
00:47:41,367 --> 00:47:42,880
Leave me alone,you basterd!

400
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:45,682
It hurts!

401
00:48:05,447 --> 00:48:08,280
I'm sorry
Because of some impulsive lust...

402
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:13,199
I robbed someone's bag...Sorry

403
00:48:14,047 --> 00:48:18,677
I feel so reg...

404
00:48:22,047 --> 00:48:24,322
How to spell regretful?

405
00:48:24,967 --> 00:48:28,437
Sounds familiar...
But I forgot

406
00:48:32,047 --> 00:48:33,036
Regretful?

407
00:48:33,887 --> 00:48:35,445
It's just regretful!

408
00:48:37,767 --> 00:48:40,406
Look it up in the dictionary while you are in jail
you'll have a lot of time

409
00:48:40,727 --> 00:48:42,240
It'll be more profound,if you found it on your own

410
00:48:46,527 --> 00:48:49,564
Use "regreet" instead
that's not very different

411
00:48:53,407 --> 00:48:54,396
Sister

412
00:48:55,607 --> 00:48:58,326
Madam,do you have a scroll?

413
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:00,316
I'll get it

414
00:49:02,047 --> 00:49:04,607
Actually,
I was going to ask you how to take these two prisoners to the custody house

415
00:49:06,767 --> 00:49:08,086
Just like that

416
00:49:09,127 --> 00:49:11,846
No,I mean...how?

417
00:49:13,847 --> 00:49:15,883
I'm new here,so i'm not so familiars

418
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:21,556
Go

419
00:49:21,967 --> 00:49:22,956
Go

420
00:49:23,007 --> 00:49:24,679
Remember to plead for me!

421
00:49:24,847 --> 00:49:25,836
Thank you, brother!

422
00:49:25,887 --> 00:49:26,876
Stop crying

423
00:49:27,447 --> 00:49:28,846
Remember to check the spelling of "regret"!

424
00:49:31,127 --> 00:49:32,116
What did they do?

425
00:49:32,767 --> 00:49:33,756
Nothing big

426
00:49:34,487 --> 00:49:38,036
Let me introduce myself
I'm supreme supervisor...Zheng Xiaofeng

427
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:41,676
I'm not finished...

428
00:49:42,287 --> 00:49:46,360
I'm ...the partner of the supreme supervisor Zheng Xiaofeng
Serial Number 1667

429
00:49:50,607 --> 00:49:51,596
I...

430
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:54,875
I'm Sa Sa
I'm in the department of computer surporting

431
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:13,120
Everybody! Our big hero is back!

432
00:50:14,127 --> 00:50:19,326
So...what award would you like this time?

433
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:21,361
How dare you come back here?

434
00:50:22,207 --> 00:50:24,163
You are not welcomed ,got it?

435
00:50:27,007 --> 00:50:30,477
Who's talking?
Chief of the police department?

436
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:32,556
Who are you?

437
00:50:32,887 --> 00:50:34,240
Serial Number 1667,Sir!

438
00:50:35,807 --> 00:50:38,037
Who are you fooling?

439
00:50:38,727 --> 00:50:42,083
I'm assigned here to investigate the robbery of The Bank of Asia,Sir

440
00:50:42,647 --> 00:50:45,320
How come I've never heard that there'll be someone assigned to me?

441
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:48,720
I'm not talking about you
I meant with Chen Sir

442
00:50:51,887 --> 00:50:55,357
In this case,I'm the top commander here
It has nothing to do with him

443
00:50:57,527 --> 00:51:00,325
Yes,you can go with him

444
00:51:01,407 --> 00:51:05,958
I applied to come here to solve this case with you
and you tell me to work with this idiot?

445
00:51:09,127 --> 00:51:10,480
Can he crack the case?

446
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:16,677
Kid,it seems I have to tell you something about Chen Sir

447
00:51:18,887 --> 00:51:23,677
Last time,he took nine of our men to solve a case

448
00:51:24,647 --> 00:51:27,320
and they all got killed!
Do you know that?!

449
00:51:28,087 --> 00:51:31,602
People standing here have either lost classmates or comrades!

450
00:51:31,847 --> 00:51:33,883
If not their souls,at least their bows

451
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:35,196
It was all because of his arrogance!

452
00:51:35,407 --> 00:51:37,238
You tell me, who's to take the blame?

453
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:39,796
Yes,Sir

454
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,395
But I also know that
before the robbery of The Bank of Asia

455
00:51:44,007 --> 00:51:47,124
there's no case that Chen Sir can't solve

456
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:50,920
So he came back today
to solve this case

457
00:51:51,607 --> 00:51:53,643
If you're afraid that Chen Sir can solve this case sooner than you

458
00:51:53,807 --> 00:51:55,923
and that you'll be embarrassed in front of everybody...

459
00:51:56,087 --> 00:51:57,679
I can totally understand that,Sir!

460
00:52:09,887 --> 00:52:14,005
OK,I'll give both of you the permission to work this case

461
00:52:14,527 --> 00:52:15,676
We'll see who will solve it first!

462
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:17,356
What's the bet?

463
00:52:18,087 --> 00:52:19,998
The loser has to knock head and apologize to the winer

464
00:52:21,047 --> 00:52:22,036
Count me in

465
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:23,556
Are you qualified?

466
00:52:26,607 --> 00:52:30,680
Chen Sir...

467
00:52:31,087 --> 00:52:32,076
I'm out!

468
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,880
Chen Sir,he has already said it out

469
00:52:37,927 --> 00:52:40,122
Whoever loses,he must never be a cop again

470
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:41,596
Hold it!

471
00:52:42,407 --> 00:52:43,886
Deal!

472
00:52:46,087 --> 00:52:47,076
Deal!

473
00:52:53,487 --> 00:52:54,476
Where are we going?

474
00:52:55,247 --> 00:52:56,236
Go home and sleep

475
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:59,086
What?We just took a bet

476
00:52:59,727 --> 00:53:00,716
We are sure to lose

477
00:53:01,447 --> 00:53:02,436
Then why did you take it?

478
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:04,395
I wasn't planning on being a cop again anyway

479
00:53:04,607 --> 00:53:06,245
Please,I am with you now

480
00:53:09,607 --> 00:53:12,326
Why do you want to work this case?
Who are you?

481
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:14,886
Serial Number 1667

482
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:17,596
And?

483
00:53:19,127 --> 00:53:20,606
Serial Number 1667

484
00:53:26,247 --> 00:53:27,441
I'm Kwan's younger brother

485
00:53:28,847 --> 00:53:30,485
Do you still remember your former following?

486
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,395
I'm his brother

487
00:53:35,047 --> 00:53:36,241
I wanna catch these robbers

488
00:53:41,487 --> 00:53:43,239
Hoho,still remember your home?

489
00:53:43,727 --> 00:53:46,525
Where have you been last night?
I've been looking for you everywhere

490
00:53:46,967 --> 00:53:49,435
I had some business to discuss
Why does it have anything to do with you?

491
00:53:50,447 --> 00:53:51,596
You are my wife

492
00:53:52,207 --> 00:53:54,960
If I can't even take care of you
how am I supposed to take care of Hong Kong police?

493
00:53:56,647 --> 00:53:58,478
Who do you think you are?
A pile of shit!

494
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,805
You are just a uniform

495
00:54:01,047 --> 00:54:03,959
You think you have a reputation?
It's my father's!

496
00:54:04,887 --> 00:54:08,675
It's good that our son is not like you!

497
00:54:08,927 --> 00:54:10,963
How big a head master can be?

498
00:54:11,607 --> 00:54:12,596
What are you talking about?

499
00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:16,320
It's all by myself that I have become who I am today

500
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:18,959
You are actually the pile of shit!
Our son is just like you

501
00:54:19,567 --> 00:54:20,556
What are you saying?

502
00:54:20,607 --> 00:54:21,596
He is spoiled!

503
00:54:21,727 --> 00:54:24,844
Have you tought him anything?
You are worse. All you know is fight!

504
00:54:25,647 --> 00:54:29,322
Get up!  You pile of shit!

505
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:33,241
Get up! Do you know what time it is?
See for yourself!

506
00:54:34,047 --> 00:54:36,117
All you think about is internet¡¢spending money...

507
00:54:37,047 --> 00:54:40,676
I'm the head master here!
How you disgraced me!

508
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:47,316
Look at you!
You are nothing like me,bastard!

509
00:54:50,247 --> 00:54:51,236
Piece of shit!

510
00:54:55,367 --> 00:54:57,403
Joe,just don't give a shit about your dad

511
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:00,362
If you don't want to,just don't go to work today

512
00:55:00,727 --> 00:55:02,240
Mum will give you the money

513
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:06,276
You can do whatever you like,OK?

514
00:55:13,127 --> 00:55:14,640
There have been complaints from the citizens

515
00:55:15,007 --> 00:55:17,043
about the attitude of some of our policemen

516
00:55:17,727 --> 00:55:19,718
Let me announce this once again

517
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:23,564
While on duty

518
00:55:23,807 --> 00:55:28,722
the most important thing is :
Fair,reasonable,and legal

519
00:55:29,247 --> 00:55:32,239
So,I guarantee to each citizen:
As soon as there are problems,

520
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:38,637
the police will handle it fairly,openly,and equally.
Thanks,everybody

521
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:26,480
Do you know that
when you find something extraordinarily exciting...

522
00:56:28,047 --> 00:56:30,720
that'll be much fun than any other game in the world

523
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,241
I already told you,those robbers are game fans

524
00:56:53,727 --> 00:56:55,718
They made a net game according to your case

525
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:59,036
Did you find who they are?

526
00:57:00,007 --> 00:57:03,920
Very hard, they are from all around the world

527
00:57:06,527 --> 00:57:07,516
Sa Sa...

528
00:57:11,767 --> 00:57:14,042
This is taken from the wired television of The Bank of Asia

529
00:57:14,767 --> 00:57:15,756
Watch this robber

530
00:57:16,087 --> 00:57:18,123
what's the difference between he entered the alley and hasn't?

531
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:24,396
That bag

532
00:57:25,447 --> 00:57:27,324
Sam met these robbers that day in that alley

533
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:30,600
which makes him a suspect too

534
00:57:32,007 --> 00:57:32,996
Sam?

535
00:57:34,407 --> 00:57:35,806
Why do you always wear this clothes?

536
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:37,322
It's very important to me

537
00:57:47,647 --> 00:57:48,636
Who are you looking for?

538
00:57:48,687 --> 00:57:49,676
Sam

539
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,923
Sam?Who's Sam?

540
00:57:52,087 --> 00:57:53,076
One of your bosses

541
00:57:53,527 --> 00:57:55,518
He was a cop
You know him?

542
00:57:59,487 --> 00:58:01,079
It's him

543
00:58:01,287 --> 00:58:02,356
No! Get away!

544
00:58:04,527 --> 00:58:05,880
You...push me?

545
00:58:06,727 --> 00:58:07,716
Be careful

546
00:58:07,767 --> 00:58:08,756
Get out!

547
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:12,115
Push me,huh?

548
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:13,122
What are you doing?

549
00:58:13,167 --> 00:58:14,156
Police!

550
00:58:14,447 --> 00:58:15,436
Get out!

551
00:58:17,567 --> 00:58:18,556
You are here to make trouble?

552
00:58:38,567 --> 00:58:39,556
You hit the police?

553
00:59:06,487 --> 00:59:07,476
Don't come out if you dare!

554
00:59:35,647 --> 00:59:37,080
That was awesome!

555
00:59:59,047 --> 01:00:01,117
Sam,what happened?

556
01:00:01,647 --> 01:00:02,762
Why are you hiding here?

557
01:00:05,047 --> 01:00:08,801
This is also legitimate
Nothing to hide,right?

558
01:00:08,847 --> 01:00:09,677
Sam

559
01:00:09,727 --> 01:00:10,603
What!

560
01:00:10,647 --> 01:00:11,636
The boss is on the phone

561
01:00:15,207 --> 01:00:16,196
Boss,what is it?

562
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:19,160
What are the cops doing here?
Listen to me...

563
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,682
Don't think being a partner is such a big deal

564
01:00:22,207 --> 01:00:24,004
OK,there won't be a next time

565
01:00:24,647 --> 01:00:26,683
I can't assure you next time!

566
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:28,196
I got it

567
01:00:28,807 --> 01:00:29,842
Get out!

568
01:00:39,047 --> 01:00:42,926
Sam,I'm here for that robbery case

569
01:00:44,447 --> 01:00:46,358
You are the only one in that alley

570
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:50,204
Wing,I really don't remember...

571
01:00:50,487 --> 01:00:52,045
I really don't...

572
01:00:54,767 --> 01:00:57,884
You were a cop
You couldn't have missed this

573
01:00:59,687 --> 01:01:00,676
Do you still remember...

574
01:01:01,807 --> 01:01:03,525
Do you still remember there was a woman,with a bag?

575
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:05,996
Don't you guff!

576
01:01:09,367 --> 01:01:13,201
Wing,I really don't remember what happened that night

577
01:01:13,447 --> 01:01:15,005
Don't ask me again,OK?

578
01:01:18,327 --> 01:01:20,238
I quit because of this case

579
01:01:21,487 --> 01:01:24,479
If you came here as a friend,then I welcome you

580
01:01:25,847 --> 01:01:28,725
If you are here for the case,then I'm sorry

581
01:01:29,527 --> 01:01:36,046
Sam,I owe our brothers
Help me please

582
01:02:00,567 --> 01:02:02,558
All I know is that one of them is a woman

583
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,759
The games they play are all very extreme

584
01:02:05,607 --> 01:02:08,167
This watch is pulled from the woman's hand

585
01:02:08,487 --> 01:02:09,806
That's all I can help

586
01:02:12,287 --> 01:02:13,515
Why didn't you say this before?

587
01:02:15,567 --> 01:02:16,556
Take care of yourself

588
01:02:33,007 --> 01:02:34,440
This symbol belongs to...

589
01:02:34,887 --> 01:02:38,243
a group of extreme sport fans
who called themselves "The Ultimate Soldiers"

590
01:02:43,367 --> 01:02:46,359
They are going to hold a party at the top of Sheng Mao Center

591
01:02:47,007 --> 01:02:49,521
I see,thanks,goodbye

592
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:51,676
Extreme sport

593
01:02:56,527 --> 01:02:57,721
Group B,follow them

594
01:04:09,527 --> 01:04:10,516
That sucks!

595
01:04:28,887 --> 01:04:29,876
The one with the red hair!

596
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:41,885
Stand still!

597
01:04:42,247 --> 01:04:44,681
Stop,get down,get down!

598
01:04:48,727 --> 01:04:49,716
The police are here

599
01:04:50,327 --> 01:04:52,682
Try to leave
I'll meet you downstairs

600
01:05:01,087 --> 01:05:04,397
Now you point them out for me
you know the result

601
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,995
Watch yourself

602
01:05:08,767 --> 01:05:09,756
Shut up!

603
01:05:15,647 --> 01:05:16,636
Your friend

604
01:06:13,567 --> 01:06:16,240
Get down!Everybody get down!Be careful!

605
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:33,766
I'm on your side! 1667! Call an ambulance!

606
01:06:34,007 --> 01:06:36,521
Sam...

607
01:06:37,087 --> 01:06:43,720
I stole a bag of money and put it in a water tank

608
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:45,844
to return feneration...

609
01:06:46,847 --> 01:06:49,998
But out my awareness,they found me...

610
01:06:51,767 --> 01:06:57,205
It was me who told them about your action...

611
01:06:59,247 --> 01:07:04,560
It was me who murdered all of our brothers

612
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:12,244
Wing...I'm sorry...
