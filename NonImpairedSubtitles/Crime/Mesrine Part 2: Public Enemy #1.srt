00:00:06,524 --> 00:00:09,466
PARIS: Porte de Clignancourt
September 2nd 1979

4
00:00:15,176 --> 00:00:16,816
!

5
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:20,266
- Sir, Inspector, only one question...
- There's nothing that will help him.

6
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:22,535
- How many of you were there?
- Maybe 30, not more.

7
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:27,202
- How long have you been following them for?
- You know all details...

8
00:00:28,374 --> 00:00:30,644
- I'll inform you about everything.
- Couldn't you make the mistake?

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,990
No, I absolutly disagree.

10
00:00:32,076 --> 00:00:36,216
- Did the operation go without any complications?
- Yes. Two teams worked on it,

11
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:38,701
detectives and guys from command center.

12
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:40,901
One last question...

13
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:52,202
Open the doors. We've seen him to carry the weapons.
He had two grenades.

14
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:57,438
We fired a warning shots...
He didn't want to give it up. We had no other choice.

15
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:00,941
We would lose him if he managed
to get to the circle.

16
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,504
Jojo! Bring the stretchers!

17
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,219
We already seen everything important. Let's go.

18
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:32,678
Hold on.

19
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:09,885
Year 1973...

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,517
...thursday...

21
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:16,200
...eight...

22
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,538
...of march.

23
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,495
Testimony...

24
00:02:34,384 --> 00:02:38,542
... of Mesrin, Jacques.

25
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:42,148
Hey, you clown.
What do you think would break first, handcuffs or radiator?

26
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:46,134
My last name is Merine not Mesrine!

27
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:49,808
Like the name  "Miromesnil", it is with "s"
but you don't pronounce it.

28
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:53,415
That's enough Mesrine!
Let's talk about your friend,

29
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,925
- Grangier Ardouin.
- I don't know him.

30
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:00,584
Seriously, I don't know him.

31
00:03:00,652 --> 00:03:07,019
- Mister Jacques. Welcome.
- Hey, what's going on?

32
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:11,591
- Looks like you gained a few.
- Are you crazy? I'm on diet for last three months.

33
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:15,059
- Really? Let me see.
- You see?

34
00:03:17,543 --> 00:03:20,683
- Armed to the teeth.
- Yeah, like it's supposed to be.

35
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,118
Clear.

36
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,850
- Wait! Where are you going?
- Come on, one more right here.

37
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,878
On the floor! All of you on the floor!

38
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:43,087
On the floor!

39
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:46,133
Nobody moves! Lie down!

40
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:49,402
I said don't move!

41
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:54,078
Put all money in the bag! Hurry up!
Everybody stays down!

42
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:56,441
Hurry! Hurry!   Let's go!

43
00:03:57,847 --> 00:04:01,625
- Good girl.
- We're outta here! We're outta here!

44
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:06,138
The bank teller...  ok she recognized me...
sure, because i didn't have a mask on... so?

45
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,554
- She identified your accomplice too.
- I don't give a shit.

46
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:14,695
First, i don't know any of them and secondly,
my buddies always wear masks.

47
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:16,584
Maybe she eats too many carrots.

48
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,387
We caught you too easy.

49
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:31,741
Freeze! Don't move!
Hold him!

50
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:36,891
- You're confessing to the robbery and the murder attempt.
- Yes,  I am.

51
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:42,076
- but you are not confessing to the kidnapping.
- Why should I admit something 

52
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:43,163
that I haven't done.

53
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:45,690
It's completly logical I won't admit 
something I haven't done.

54
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:48,190
We'll take you to the court in Compiegne.

55
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:53,110
You'll be locked up...  for a very long time.

56
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:55,887
In three months I won't be there.
You wanna bet?

57
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:16,962
- What again?
- I have to go to bathroom.

58
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:20,145
- Hold it.
- I am sick! Am i supposed to shit my pants in front of judge?

59
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:24,377
- Mesrine, move.
- Sure.

60
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,256
Am i going to wipe my ass with my foot or what?

61
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,600
Hold on.

62
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:41,044
Now you can.

63
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:48,040
And what about you? What do you want? Are you gay or you want to smell 
my shit?  Let me shit!

64
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,579
Am I supposed to shit right here?
Loosen up the cuffs. I won't run.

65
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:03,206
Ahh, what a relief.

66
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:27,127
Hurry!

67
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:29,655
Now i feel better.

68
00:06:37,238 --> 00:06:40,076
Mister Mesrine, stand here...

69
00:06:40,087 --> 00:06:42,733
Your honor,  by the law i shouldn't
have the handcuffs on me.

70
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:44,406
It's the violation of my rights.

71
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:48,806
It's sounds very funny when
you talk about the law.

72
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:51,912
- For your defense you won't need to use your hands.
- Your honor...!

73
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:53,620
Enough! That's enough Mesrine!

74
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:58,804
Everyone on the ground! Let's go!

75
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,377
Unlock my handcuffs! Hurry!
Fat ass next to the wall, let's go!

76
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,121
Nobody moves!

77
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,123
Get out of there!

78
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,583
Stay on the floor!
You get up! Move!

79
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:17,240
On the floor!

80
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:22,912
Hands up! On the floor!

81
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:27,571
Everybody with your face to the floor!

82
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:29,641
Let's go!

83
00:07:29,994 --> 00:07:31,090
Quickly after him!

84
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:33,264
This won't help your case, Mesrine.

85
00:07:34,342 --> 00:07:36,680
- Don't shoot!
- Stay over there!

86
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,372
Put the gun down! Move!

87
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:42,063
- Hurry or i kill him!
- Easy, take it easy.

88
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:43,927
All of you back off!

89
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:48,689
- get out of here!
- move, go after him!

90
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,933
Go! Go!

91
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:58,212
- Why did you let the judge go?
- Move!

92
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:02,043
Go faster!

93
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,355
- Jacques!
- Watch out!

94
00:08:10,677 --> 00:08:15,190
Hand me the gun.
Back up or i'll shoot!

95
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:17,294
I said BACK UP!

96
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:19,882
I'll kill you, you moron!

97
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,060
Good bye, good luck!

98
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:55,907
Robert caught a bullet.
Can you take it out?

99
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:59,513
I don't know, I have to take a look.

100
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:01,790
Here.

101
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:04,999
- Jacques, I have a news from your family.
- What news?

102
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:08,001
Your father is sick...
Come, I'll take a look.

103
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:10,072
Shit!

104
00:09:12,556 --> 00:09:16,179
<i>Jacques Mesrine may have not commited
his most serious crime ever, yesterday,</i>

105
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:18,353
<i>but definitely his boldest.</i>

106
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,631
<i>At first, he chose the place of his escape.</i>

107
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:24,875
<i>After being arrested in march of this year,
Mesrine said he doesn't agree with the sentence.</i>

108
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:27,359
<i>He knew that his appeal hearing will be held in Compiegne court.</i>

109
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:32,204
<i>When they arrived he asked the guards a permission
to go to the bathroom.</i>

110
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:35,848
<i>He knew his accomplices hid the gun
in a toilet</i>

111
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:40,877
<i>without being noticed by the guards.
They didn't even realized and Jacques Mesrine was armed.</i>

112
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:46,053
<i>He yelled: "I kill the judge..."</i>
- That's lie! I've never said that. 

113
00:09:46,226 --> 00:09:48,641
<i>...all french cops now know</i>

114
00:09:48,845 --> 00:09:55,370
<i>that Jacques Mesrine must be considered as "The Public Enemy
number 1"</i>

115
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,555
Number 1. Number 1!

116
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:07,680
Hello.

117
00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:33,457
Dad. Dad it's me. Can you see?
It's me Jacques.

118
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:40,206
- Jacques.
- How do you feel? - You came...

119
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:45,247
I thought i'll  pay you a little visit
since all banks are closed.

120
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,146
Fool.

121
00:10:54,597 --> 00:11:02,670
- You came... Have you seen your daughter yet?
- No, not yet.

122
00:11:06,492 --> 00:11:10,713
I wasn't the best son,
but my father was proud of me.

123
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:15,289
That's the way i was born. Forgive me.

124
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:17,693
That's the way i am.

125
00:11:18,615 --> 00:11:21,358
- It's my fault.
- No, no.

126
00:11:27,242 --> 00:11:32,556
What ever happens you always 
will be her father.

127
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,319
I know.

128
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:44,254
Like you always will be my son.

129
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:49,852
Yes.

130
00:11:58,154 --> 00:12:03,387
Forgive me, please forgive me.

131
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:16,164
- I think you should go.
- Yes, i will.

132
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,184
Except children, mother and friends 
no one else is here.

133
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:48,669
He is not such an idiot to come here.

134
00:12:48,705 --> 00:12:51,567
<i>Paris, september, 1973</i>

135
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:03,472
- What"s that? Remembrance from the fight?
- No, it's from boxing.

136
00:13:03,774 --> 00:13:05,542
Oh, so you're a boxer.

137
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:11,340
Michel is a boxer too.

138
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,760
- Do you know how to drive?
- Yeah.

139
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:24,901
We're planning a small job.
Are you interested?

140
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:55,853
<i>Stolen car have been reported.

143
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,159
Shit!

144
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,700
The street is not an ashtray, sir.
We'll have to give you a fine.

145
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:25,760
Get out of the car and show us 
your papers, please.

146
00:14:30,948 --> 00:14:32,913
I'm waiting. Get out of the car!

147

Don't resist! Put the hands behind your back!
Quickly!

148
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:43,286
Shit.

149
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,590
Move out of my way.

150
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:11,215
Stop! Stop!

151
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,449
Get out of the car!

Step on it!

157
00:16:13,526 --> 00:16:14,870
Faster! Faster!

158
00:16:40,658 --> 00:16:41,692
Go!

159
00:16:48,144 --> 00:16:49,111
Let's leave!

160
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:00,144
Out of way!

161
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,475
Come on, train is here!

162
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,547
Move! Quick! Jump in!

163
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:16,275
Nobody moves!
Shut up! Sit down!

164
00:17:30,113 --> 00:17:31,211
Shit!

165
00:17:31,777 --> 00:17:33,546
Who are you starring at? Stare at floor!

166
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:43,752
I knew he'd fuck it up. He's an asshole!
They almost got us because of him!

167
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,375
You're always the smartest one and i'm an idiot.
And now leave me alone!

168
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:52,799
Alone? What are you talking about?! Cops got him!
Now that moron is blabbing to them!

169
00:17:57,975 --> 00:18:01,971
Listen to me! I only choose those
who knows how to keep their mouth shut.

170
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:03,627
Go fuck yourself!

171
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:09,236
Always!

172
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:15,829
If you're so sure about it
then you'll have to do it without me.

173
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:18,934
I'm done Mesrin!

174
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,622
- Then just leave!
- I'm gone!

175
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,836
You get out of here too!
Come on! Get out!

176
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:05,785
Inspector Broussard!

177
00:19:08,174 --> 00:19:11,145
- Are we going to wait any longer?
- I'll let you know.

178
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:16,629
- My guys are on the roof for 8 hours already and it's raining.
- I see. We have a plenty of time.

179
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:21,288
Moron.

180
00:19:31,018 --> 00:19:32,967
Open! The police.

181
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:38,040
The Police! The building is surrounded!

182
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:48,599
The police! Open up!

183
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:53,671
- The house is surrounded!
- What? What's going on?

184
00:19:53,836 --> 00:19:59,365
- Who is it? What do you want from me?
- Open or we kick the door!

185
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:04,955
Go fuck yourselves!
I belong to Baader's!

186
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:09,096
I'll blow it all up!
Long live revolution!

187
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,166
Quickly, get dressed! Move yourself!

188
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:14,582
Of course...
Danke schon.

189
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,895
That's enough Jacques, you lost.

190
00:20:19,913 --> 00:20:25,099
- Who do you think you are talking to me like that?
- Robert Broussard, police inspector.

191
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:33,880
Aha, Broussard, the one with the moustache like a sailor.
All newspapers write about you.

192
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,624
Exactly.

193
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,278
- Let's end this circus. Give up!
- I don't care!

194
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:44,595
How can I trust you? 
Slip your identity card through the door so I can see it.

195
00:20:45,095 --> 00:20:48,456
- So you could shoot me?
- Or you me, when i try to pick it up?

196
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,413
You're right.

197
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:03,318
So then what? I'm giving you my word,
you can trust me.

198
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:08,701
I won't fire.
Come on Broussard, don't hesitate.

199
00:21:12,617 --> 00:21:15,119
- Ok Jacques.
- I'm waiting.

200
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,431
Catch.

201
00:21:34,873 --> 00:21:36,030
So what?

202
00:21:43,776 --> 00:21:45,243
- Broussard?
- yes?

203
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,351
- I have two requirements.
- I hope they're reasonable...

204
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,802
First one is that you won't touch the girl who's 
here with me.

205
00:21:56,768 --> 00:21:59,560
And second one, I need 20 minutes to get
something in the order.

206
00:22:00,383 --> 00:22:02,738
Do you have any other wish?
Would you like a car with a driver?

207
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:07,610
If I want to maybe that too.
You are not in position to negotiate, Broussard.

208
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:10,015
So? I'm waiting!

209
00:22:13,228 --> 00:22:14,353
So what is it!

210
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,955
You got 20 minutes, Jacques. 20 minutes!

211
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,581
Jacques, what should i do?

212
00:22:28,134 --> 00:22:30,409
Answer me, Jacques.
Can i help you with something?

213
00:22:32,896 --> 00:22:35,140
- What are they going to do with me?
- Bring me the matches from the table.

214
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:37,448
- I'm scared.
- Bring the matches!

215
00:22:43,145 --> 00:22:44,249
Here you go.

216
00:22:44,335 --> 00:22:48,597
They'll arrest me. You think they put me in jail?
I don't want to go to jail...

217
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:52,634
- Calm down. Easy.
- How can i calm down, they will...

218
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:53,877
Calm down!

219
00:22:55,101 --> 00:22:57,603
Are you finished? Are you calm?

220
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:08,814
- What will they do with me?
- Don't worry. Everything will be all right.

221
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:15,512
Just easy, quiet...

222
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:34,560
What are you waiting for, Mesrine?
What are you trying to do over there?

223
00:23:35,992 --> 00:23:38,390
We gave you 20 minutes not 40.

224
00:23:38,476 --> 00:23:43,463
Broussard, are you brave enough to come in here without a gun
and bulletproof vest?

225
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:51,744
- Why is that?
- I want to know, if you can do it.

226
00:23:53,228 --> 00:23:57,852
So, are you coming in or are you scared?

227
00:24:01,664 --> 00:24:03,131
Hey! Broussard?

228
00:24:05,495 --> 00:24:07,065
Well, ok then.

229
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,214
See? I took the vest down and put gun away.

230
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,906
And what about you?
Do you have a courage to come out without the gun?

231
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,910
As you can see, I do.

232
00:24:39,553 --> 00:24:44,643
Hey you the artist, take a picture of us together.
The big glory moment of Inspector Broussard!

233
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,313
If you insist.

234
00:24:50,712 --> 00:24:53,245
Didn't you wonder why i didn't kill you and your buddies?

235
00:24:53,652 --> 00:24:56,216
We cops do not wonder, but we act.

236
00:24:56,612 --> 00:25:01,081
Just because the woman was here.
Just because of that... that she was here.

237
00:25:01,426 --> 00:25:05,533
Next time there won't be a woman nor chapaigne.
Just two of us.

238
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:13,607
To our next meeting.

239
00:25:24,718 --> 00:25:27,613
<i>Prison de la Santé
Paris, 1973.</i>

240
00:26:06,126 --> 00:26:07,334
Guard!

241
00:26:10,266 --> 00:26:11,475
Guard!

242
00:26:20,101 --> 00:26:24,829
- What do you need Jacques?
- What kind of guy is he, that Pinochet?

243
00:26:26,364 --> 00:26:31,315
- He's Chilean general.
- The general in Chile?

244
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:36,216
The whole page about some Pinochet
but no a word about me!

245
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:43,907
- There was a coup.
- A coup? Bring me the typewriter.

246
00:26:44,014 --> 00:26:46,568
- I want to write something!
- Alright, I try.

247
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:48,742
Go!

248
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:53,918
Pinochet. Pinochet!

249
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:08,462
<i>County jail...</i>

250
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,294
<i>" DEATH INSTINCT"
What do you think it is?</i>

251
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:48,058
- This is my book.
- This is not a book, it is the death sentence.

252
00:27:48,972 --> 00:27:54,477
You have a trial in two months and you're publishing a book in which
you're confessing to committing 40 murders.

253
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,893
At this moment all cops in France are studying your book.

254
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:03,172
And after they finish, they use everything from your
memoirs in a indictment against you.

255
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:08,969
- Well in that case they have to be retarded.
- What do you mean?

256
00:28:09,676 --> 00:28:14,145
- This is not the truth?
- Audience loves the  plot, the action...

257
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:19,114
- And?
- And i don't think that jurry will believe

258
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,669
that i am such an idiot, that would confess to something
that would put me on gilotene.

259
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:29,466
And in the eyes of the nation I'm a Star.

260
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:34,278
You entertain the nation but at the same time you horrify it.

261
00:28:34,314 --> 00:28:38,887
And as far as they can push the fear by not letting you go free,
they won't.

262
00:28:38,972 --> 00:28:43,959
So middle-class, such a funny honest word.

263
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,199
They allowed you a visit.

264
00:29:36,581 --> 00:29:39,239
- I grew up.
- I see.

265
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:45,553
- I cannot notice.
- I'm not a child anymore.

266
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:57,147
- You really are beautiful.
- Thanks.

267
00:30:02,151 --> 00:30:09,259
- And how are... your brothers?
- Boris and Bruno are doing fine,

268
00:30:09,697 --> 00:30:12,779
they're acting like a fools otherwise nothing is new.

269
00:30:14,366 --> 00:30:19,094
- That's weird.
- Yes.

270
00:30:20,836 --> 00:30:27,168
- Didn't he ride his bike with some punks.
- Do you want play on a father...?

271
00:30:29,117 --> 00:30:34,207
- I didn't come here to be lectured.
- Alright, just be careful.

272
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:53,255
- When you come back home?
- It won't be that soon.

273
00:30:59,242 --> 00:31:05,677
Honey i'm sorry...  i'd rather to meet you
under different circumstances.

274
00:31:06,488 --> 00:31:11,785
At least i know where i can always find you.

275
00:31:17,772 --> 00:31:19,342
I miss you.

276
00:31:37,544 --> 00:31:44,290
Jacques Merine, are you still denying
contact with Michele Ardouin?

277
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:46,878
I already said I don't know him.
I do not know him!

278
00:31:46,964 --> 00:31:51,019
Michel Ardouin stand up so
Mesrine can see you better.

279
00:31:53,486 --> 00:31:57,437
I'm telling you i don't know him.
I would remember that nose for sure.

280
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:07,065
Do you admit that you took chief judge as a hostage during your escape?

281
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:10,998
I've hid behind the justice
as any decent citizen would.

282
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,344
What's wrong about that?

283
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:18,038
Nothing, if your escape doesn't change to kidnaping.

284
00:32:22,161 --> 00:32:32,427
Sir, in clothes from 101 dalmatians,
escape is everyone's bounden duty and the right,

285
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:35,429
and it is a business too,

286
00:32:36,395 --> 00:32:42,951
and so i wouldn't just talk in the wind,
ladies and gentlemen, in my hand i have a key. Can you see?

287
00:32:43,175 --> 00:32:48,400
And do you know what kind of key it is?
It is by a coincidence a key for my handcuffs.

288
00:32:49,852 --> 00:32:53,441
Just look!
And do you know how did i get ahold of it?

289
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:59,446
I simply bought it from my guard
for a half million of old franks.

290
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,172
Sirs journalists, dear jury,

291
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,866
this is your system, which you and prosecutor
are so defending it.

292
00:33:09,211 --> 00:33:11,557
We are honored by his presence. 
inspector Broussard,

293
00:33:11,954 --> 00:33:17,354
who's sitting right next to journalists.
Inspector! Look at it yourself.

294
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:19,425
I'm done.

295
00:33:19,718 --> 00:33:24,597
Tell us Mr. Mesrine, why would you need such a big arsenal of weapons
we found at your place?

296
00:33:29,035 --> 00:33:31,330
Your honor, how should i explain it...

297
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:37,506
Since i was a kid, this unexplainable 
feeling of vulnerability is following me.

298
00:33:40,008 --> 00:33:41,060
You should thank me...

299
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:45,926
I analyze murderers, i help cops,
i provide work for the doctors at the emergency rooms.

300
00:33:50,825 --> 00:33:53,483
Before us we have a picture of nice looking man.

301
00:33:53,776 --> 00:33:57,862
But he is a gangster,
who doesn't hurt any one,

302
00:33:58,124 --> 00:34:01,557
he's even gentle to his victims...

303
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:11,185
All this is just a pretence, 
a mask covering a bestial animal.

304
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,120
They don't exist good gangsters,
there are only gangsters and nothing more...

305
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,123
and before you is standing one.

306
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:29,611
Mersine, you start shooting without thinking,
when you see that situation is getting out of your hands.

307
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:38,410
Ladies and gentlemen, dear jury,
you're deciding today about the justice

308
00:34:38,548 --> 00:34:40,067
and you will bring the sentence.

309
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:45,129
The society which doesn't punish criminals,
cannot be considered righteous.

310
00:35:00,846 --> 00:35:03,690
So I am the public enemy nbr. 1?!
What?

311
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:06,868
This is all bullshit.

312
00:35:07,885 --> 00:35:12,458
I am the enemy of the government, the banks,
yes, it is right and accurate to je pøesné a výstižné.

313
00:35:12,854 --> 00:35:14,839
I steal from them, that's why they don't like me,

314
00:35:15,649 --> 00:35:19,601
but when i steal from banks,
i don't feel like i'm breaking the law.

315
00:35:20,411 --> 00:35:22,706
I'm stealing from a bigger thief.

316
00:35:25,484 --> 00:35:30,781
Do you want to put me in jail,
throw out the key and forget about me?!

317
00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:33,783
Go ahead, just stick me in there!

318
00:35:34,076 --> 00:35:40,719
But remember what i said,
i'll run away from there. I promise you that!

319
00:35:42,564 --> 00:35:47,033
The jury with eight votes

Hi.

Are you sweating on purpose or is this normal?

330
00:37:19,941 --> 00:37:23,582
Could you at least answer me,
I am Jacques Mesrine.

331
00:37:25,324 --> 00:37:28,654
So what?
What you doing in my yard?

332
00:37:32,053 --> 00:37:35,901
Here, is not a custom to forbid anything from me.

333
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:40,352
Yeah , i've noticed.

334
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:47,184
- By the way, i have 3 escapes behind me.
- Me too.

335
00:37:51,411 --> 00:37:52,360
Maybe...

- It's ok boss,  a tin foil is inside.
- Allright

341
00:40:02,571 --> 00:40:04,555
Mr. Jacques, your lawyer is here.

342

Two minutes?

344
00:40:52,105 --> 00:40:53,313
Hello.

345
00:40:56,453 --> 00:41:00,280
- What's going on?
- It's about the story in Canada.

346

- But i don't have your manuscripts.
- Then let's get it right.

as fast as you can, please.

- Ok.
- Thanks chief.

353
00:42:12,798 --> 00:42:15,990
If someone will get to know about this, nothing will help me.

354
00:42:19,527 --> 00:42:22,133
- I'm done.
- Don't worry,

355
00:42:22,322 --> 00:42:27,826
you are saving my life
and i won't be destroying yours.

356
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:33,520
- Will everything go smoothly?
- Already did.

357
00:42:35,935 --> 00:42:37,868
Mesrine wants his manuscripts.

358

- François, sexual passion...

417

  to find out how many people is here?
- Without comments, corporal.

- Tell me, how many of you are working here?
- Here, a few tens of employees.

- Not at all. - No doubt.

440

- Why are you here?
- Obviously you know,

441
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:39,793
that your cutthroats escaped from prison.
Did you hear any gossip about their plans?

442
00:51:40,552 --> 00:51:47,174
- It's about Besse and Mesrine.
- No, i didn't. And you think they could come here?

443

You never know with these guys, corporal.

444

Be careful, especially the shorter one,

- Sure.
- Sure...

446

We have a lot of work to do. Thank you, corporal.

What we can do.
See you later.

but they have the whole regimnet there.

Don't whine! Even if they had a whole army in there
you would act like a chicken.

00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:26,998
See you.

451
00:53:14,962 --> 00:53:18,168
- Are you talking about counterfeit money?
- Yes, exactly.

452
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:22,899
And you'd probably like to check my safe.

453
00:53:23,865 --> 00:53:25,073
That would be nice.

454
00:53:33,647 --> 00:53:36,667
Do you have a court order?

455
00:53:39,962 --> 00:53:42,909
No no, please.
The court order.

456
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,363
- Court order.
- Yes.

457
00:53:48,761 --> 00:53:53,230
He's right. Do you have a warrant, inspector?
I have it...

458
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:59,095
I have a brilliant order, clearly it is a metal one.
Let's go grandpa, fill up the bag.

459
00:53:59,682 --> 00:54:04,410
To the safe, move! Let's go, hurry!
Open the safe!

460
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:13,520
Don't stare at me, help him out!
Hurry up!

461
00:54:58,585 --> 00:54:59,410
Run!

462
00:55:21,101 --> 00:55:22,360
Get in!

463
00:55:26,432 --> 00:55:27,640
Come on, go already!

464
00:55:39,734 --> 00:55:40,787
Hang on!

465
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:52,381
Move!

466
00:55:58,782 --> 00:56:01,801
- Shit!
- What? Why did you stop?

467
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:04,700
Damn!

468
00:56:15,966 --> 00:56:16,915
<i>Attention!</i>

<i>Leaders of platoons. Get ready for the operation!
Turn right!</i>

472
00:56:38,275 --> 00:56:39,690

00:56:44,745 --> 00:56:45,694

<i>Jacques Merine together with his accomplice
François Besse...</i>

476
00:58:06,007 --> 00:58:14,441
<i>ran away from the crime scene in a car. Gangsters...</i>
- Enough of it, right? 

477
00:58:19,569 --> 00:58:22,205
This is a way better.
We change the clothes...

478
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:31,698
Thanks for them.

479
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:26,770
What do you say 
if instead of school...

480
00:59:27,477 --> 00:59:31,460
we would make a trip with uncle François
and uncle Jacques?

481
00:59:32,136 --> 00:59:37,878
with dad and mom too, if they want to?
What?

482
00:59:38,554 --> 00:59:43,365
We'll vote.
I'm for it. François, what about you?

483
00:59:47,094 --> 00:59:56,377
Aha, now it's two of us.
And dad? He agrees too. And mom?

484
01:00:00,345 --> 01:00:03,861
and kids.
Excellent, everyone agrees.

485
01:00:05,987 --> 01:00:07,764
Great, perfect!

486
01:00:14,268 --> 01:00:15,425
So, are we going?

487
01:00:29,952 --> 01:00:34,058
- careful... hang on.
- Damn!

488
01:00:37,043 --> 01:00:42,133
- Come here. What's your name?
- Daniel.

489
01:00:43,047 --> 01:00:46,998
Do you know how to get to Chafourux?

490
01:00:47,188 --> 01:00:51,553
You take us and drop us off overthere.
Do we have a deal?

491
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:58,489
I don't have to tell you what happens if...

492
01:01:01,577 --> 01:01:02,837
Good.

493
01:01:09,548 --> 01:01:11,015
We can go.

494
01:01:13,896 --> 01:01:16,294
Go, Go, faster!

495
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:19,400
Keep going, keep going.

496
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:21,884
Faster, faster!

497
01:01:24,455 --> 01:01:26,025
Hello, madam. Control.

What's going on?

499
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:45,315
Control.

500
01:01:45,522 --> 01:01:47,385
Could you please open the trunk?

501
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:53,251
- Put the armrest back and turn off the radio!
- Kids, put it back.

502
01:01:58,616 --> 01:02:01,325
God, help us.

503
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:11,160
Keep going please.
Faster, go.

504
01:02:12,281 --> 01:02:13,334
Stop!

505
01:02:14,455 --> 01:02:18,613
Madam, have you noticed anything out of ordinary?
We check your car.

506
01:02:19,113 --> 01:02:20,601
Open the trunk please

507
01:02:29,776 --> 01:02:31,035
Ok thank you.

508
01:02:31,225 --> 01:02:32,795
Just sit here quietly.

509
01:02:34,862 --> 01:02:35,956
Bye madam.

510
01:02:41,694 --> 01:02:44,818
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

511
01:02:45,111 --> 01:02:48,472
- You haven't noticed on your way anything out of ordinary?
- No.

512
01:02:56,601 --> 01:02:58,275
- Everything alright kids?
- Yes.

513
01:02:58,465 --> 01:03:01,381
<i>- We must to check your car.
- I'm on the road from 4 am!</i>

514
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:04,693
<i>- When do you finally get that Mesrine?
- Step out of the car.</i>

515
01:03:05,504 --> 01:03:10,801
<i>- Open the trunk.
- What's going on? I don't have anything there!</i>

516
01:03:13,786 --> 01:03:20,325
<i>- Don't argue, we must to check it out.
- I said i don't have anything there!</i>

517
01:03:21,032 --> 01:03:24,362
You can go sir. Go, Go already!

518
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:01,733
Nobody is here.

519
01:04:32,978 --> 01:04:40,553
Daniel, come closer.
Come here! Don't be afraid!

520
01:04:51,508 --> 01:04:52,561
Here, it's yours.

521
01:04:55,804 --> 01:04:59,600
Reward for your trouble,
but mainly for being quiet.

522
01:05:00,877 --> 01:05:02,426
I understand. Okay.

523
01:05:02,688 --> 01:05:06,329
- How much did you give him?
- Some change, around hundred.

524
01:05:06,518 --> 01:05:11,194
- Hundred thousand for these lousy clothes?
You're some businessman. - Come on, stop!

525
01:05:11,487 --> 01:05:14,228
- You good. Go.
- Thank you.

526
01:05:15,576 --> 01:05:16,577
Bye.

527
01:06:07,906 --> 01:06:09,476
<i>Soldiers just arrived.</i>

528
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:18,896
- Here it is.
- Are you sure?

529
01:06:19,086 --> 01:06:26,350
We can cross here. Look.
Hand me that wood. Do you doubt that?

530
01:06:27,471 --> 01:06:31,526
- Well it doesn't seem...
- Do you see that? Look.

531
01:06:31,922 --> 01:06:35,459
- He's not sure. See?
- Ok?

532
01:06:40,411 --> 01:06:41,567
Well, go.

533
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:50,573
You see? Here is shallow water, look and
you didn't believe me.

534
01:06:51,177 --> 01:06:54,093
Oops, a little bit deeper here.

535
01:06:55,525 --> 01:06:56,474
Shit!

536
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:58,027
Are you coming?

537
01:07:07,067 --> 01:07:08,586
Here, hold on to it.

538
01:07:11,363 --> 01:07:15,625
Good, good... Watch out there's a hole!

539
01:07:16,539 --> 01:07:20,076
- Here, take it. Hold it!
- What are you doing?

540
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:23,182
- I'll thow the money on river bank.
- Cut it out! It's too far!

541
01:07:23,237 --> 01:07:29,393
- Calm down! Don't you trust me again?
- Don't throw it! Don't do it, it's too far!

542
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:38,606
- Shit!
- Stop! Watch out!

543
01:07:39,728 --> 01:07:41,608
Come back François! François!

544
01:07:42,937 --> 01:07:46,267
- Shit!
- François, they drifted away!

545
01:07:50,597 --> 01:07:52,892
- That was your share!
- Good then.

546
01:07:55,670 --> 01:08:03,141
- What's in those bushes over there? Look Jacques!
- A little boat. You kidding me.

547
01:08:34,179 --> 01:08:37,302
<i>...and the search of the area 
continued the whole night,</i>

548
01:08:37,595 --> 01:08:42,271
<i>despite the effort of the dogs,
helicopters and armed forces,</i>

549
01:08:42,357 --> 01:08:49,310
<i>we must confirm that their effort was fruitless.</i>

550
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,481
- Hi. - Hello.
- Hello.

551
01:09:41,081 --> 01:09:50,726
- So? Are you gonna buy me a drink?
- Chapaigne, the best one you have.

552
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:54,266
- Do you have Crystal?
- Yes, of course.

553
01:09:55,159 --> 01:09:56,730
Give me the bottle.

554
01:10:07,892 --> 01:10:11,119
- What's your name?
- Sylvia.

555
01:10:13,172 --> 01:10:16,916
And you? What's your name?

556
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:23,334
- Jacques! Jacques! Jacques!
- So what's my name? What is it?

557
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:43,003
- I read my horoscope in the morning.
- And? What did it say?

558
01:10:46,816 --> 01:10:48,593
That i fall in love.

559
01:10:50,025 --> 01:10:53,045
<i>Paris, July 1978.</i>

560
01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:55,218
So, Isabelle? Where's my gift?

561
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,297
- Thanks.
- Can we begin?

562
01:11:09,487 --> 01:11:11,678
Be brave Isabelle, get on me.

563
01:11:16,526 --> 01:11:17,993
Why are you doing this?

564
01:11:32,364 --> 01:11:33,935
Because i don't like the laws.

565
01:11:34,128 --> 01:11:37,558
i don't like the laws and i don't want
to be a slave of the alarm clock the whole my life.

566
01:11:37,613 --> 01:11:40,664
I don't want the whole my life just to dream.
I don't want always to think,

567
01:11:40,718 --> 01:11:44,597
how i have to work a half year,
so i could buy some thing.

568
01:11:44,683 --> 01:11:48,013
- No. No!
- What do you expect from the life?

569
01:11:49,963 --> 01:11:54,049
-Recognition? Money?
- Money, Money! All of you...

570
01:11:54,104 --> 01:11:58,262
just keep talking abot them, always the same.
But i'm completely different.

571
01:11:58,658 --> 01:12:03,852
What exactly am i doing?
I'm looking for the money in the places where they are, that means in the banks.

572
01:12:06,112 --> 01:12:08,852
Regarding the politics,
are you on the left or the right?

573
01:12:09,424 --> 01:12:13,790
Neither side. I think politics are dirty game
it's better to keep the distance from it.

574
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:16,378
I don't trust any politician.

575
01:12:16,981 --> 01:12:25,312
- Do you consider yourself as a dangerous individual?
- Dangerous... And according to you?

576
01:12:26,712 --> 01:12:31,802
I don't know, maybe i'm dangerous. I don't know.
Why are you asking?

577
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:39,049
Depends to whom.
For instance i don't play with cops...

578
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,844
Shoot it!

579
01:12:43,431 --> 01:12:44,949
Good photograph, publish it!

580
01:12:47,002 --> 01:12:53,955
Dangerous...
Probably yes. I'm probably dangerous.

581
01:12:54,248 --> 01:13:02,548
- What kind of old age and death will you have?
- Old age. Honestly, i don't think i'll live that long.

582
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:09,690
One day they shoot me to death, it completly makes sense.
Natural.

583
01:13:11,536 --> 01:13:15,488
After all for some one who was in prison with maximum security,
there are no rules.

584
01:13:15,884 --> 01:13:19,628
- Like me, i live without rules.
- Without rules and without hope?

585
01:13:21,888 --> 01:13:25,322
- Do you have any plans?
- I've got a lot of plans. Plans...

586
01:13:25,511 --> 01:13:28,635
Close the prison with maximum security.
I lived there for 5 years.

587
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:33,428
Can you imagine? The whole 5 years!
i want all of those who sit there to let go!

588
01:13:33,793 --> 01:13:36,474
I've seen over there, how they break people,
how they destroy them.

589
01:13:37,106 --> 01:13:40,539
But our Mr. Minister, Alain Perfite
he didn't get it yet,

590
01:13:40,832 --> 01:13:45,508
i am an excellent shooter and i can kill a few judges.

591
01:13:45,905 --> 01:13:50,198
Do we need in France gangs of Bordeleo?
Do we need Red brigades?

592
01:13:50,812 --> 01:13:54,307
Let them ask themselves the question.
Because if there will be need to go in their neighborhoods,

593
01:13:54,393 --> 01:13:58,552
to train with Palestinians, I'll go!
They can shit their pants!

594
01:13:58,845 --> 01:14:03,034
- Do you want something to drink? Coffee?
- with delight. - Sugar?

595
01:14:13,855 --> 01:14:23,396

596
01:14:41,495 --> 01:14:45,684
- Jacques Merine.
- Yes? - They write about you in "Match".

597
01:14:46,464 --> 01:14:47,724
Not even a year have passed.

598
01:14:51,122 --> 01:14:57,869
Today's menu, lamb legs.
I'm getting sick of these english meals.

599
01:15:06,754 --> 01:15:09,566
"if there will be need to join Palestinian,
i'll come..."

600
01:15:10,687 --> 01:15:15,363
"if there will be need , i'll start wave of violence
 France never seen before".

601
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:20,850
- I said it and i will do it.
- "I'm the expert on explosives". Moron!

602
01:15:21,143 --> 01:15:24,784
- Next?
- "...can kill a few judges"

603
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:29,753
- What kind of nonsense is this?!
- It's not a nonsense.

604
01:15:30,563 --> 01:15:33,272
- It's a revolution.
- A what? - A revolution!

605
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:36,792
We are a criminals, not a revolutionists.
We are not going to destroy the system.

606
01:15:38,638 --> 01:15:42,486
You see honey? This is typical
little cry baby.

607
01:15:42,986 --> 01:15:45,902
Sam is short, his ideals are small.

608
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:54,390
I'm not overestimating my power
and i'm not calling for vendetta against the state.

609
01:15:54,476 --> 01:15:56,047
- That's it!
- Yeah, that's it.

610
01:15:57,271 --> 01:16:02,082
Well, i won't sign your magazine then.

611
01:16:04,981 --> 01:16:06,741
You can wipe your ass with it.

612
01:16:07,106 --> 01:16:13,127
- Please stop it. François, come to the table.
- I don't work like this.

613
01:16:13,317 --> 01:16:17,061
Simple just know how to use media.
That's all.

614
01:16:17,251 --> 01:16:21,440
- We have to talk.
- Anytime. But now come to the table.

615
01:16:22,219 --> 01:16:27,134
I'm inviting you to the table of accused.

616
01:16:30,087 --> 01:16:36,833
i have a great plan.
we kidnap a billionaire.

617
01:16:39,611 --> 01:16:42,423
- What are we going to do?
- What kind of question is that? Think about it.

618
01:16:42,509 --> 01:16:52,361
I tell you, the one i've chose
is a big fat cat.

619
01:16:52,654 --> 01:16:55,467
Old fart is forcing people to live in rabbit holes.

620
01:16:56,899 --> 01:17:04,163
It's a serious thing, you can trust me.
And then... You know what we gonna do then?

621
01:17:05,077 --> 01:17:09,960
We'll buy the bazookas and we attack the prison.

622
01:17:15,739 --> 01:17:19,401
Listen Jacques, we attack the prison,
again why not...

623
01:17:20,398 --> 01:17:27,278
- And then? What else do you want to drag me in to?
- After all... - Besides you're not going ever stop.

624
01:17:28,472 --> 01:17:32,869
You want to destroy this sytem
and on contrary i want to profit from it.

625
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:39,877
simply you're fool,
you don't realize the consequences.

626
01:17:42,913 --> 01:17:48,396
- Fool? - Fool.
- What's this fool? I don't understand you at all.

627
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:55,850
<i>Sarthe, june 1979.</i>

628
01:18:09,155 --> 01:18:14,276
- Hi, how are you? Is Mr. Leliévre at home?
- I'm his son. And you are?

629
01:18:18,679 --> 01:18:22,320
Inspector Vaugier, police.
Can we go in?

630
01:18:29,859 --> 01:18:34,049
- What's going on?
- Do you own a few houses for rent?

631
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:36,295
We'd like to talk about that.

632
01:18:40,108 --> 01:18:41,160
Wait.

633
01:18:41,764 --> 01:18:42,713
Thank you.

634
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:50,788
<i>Two cops are here and they 
want to talk to you.</i>

635
01:19:04,694 --> 01:19:08,904
- How can i be to use for you gentlemen?
- We received a complaint from...

636
01:19:08,959 --> 01:19:11,626
a few renters of your apartments,
regarding a bad living conditions.

637
01:19:12,199 --> 01:19:14,390
We ask you to come with us
to police station.

638
01:19:15,046 --> 01:19:18,738
- Couldn't we to take care of it here?
- Please, how would it look like.

639
01:19:18,979 --> 01:19:25,394
Well in that case let's go.
I hope it won't take too long.

640
01:19:26,329 --> 01:19:30,570
- Tell Charlie, to get the car ready...
- That won't be necessary, we have a car.

641
01:19:31,816 --> 01:19:36,989
- We can bring you back.
- Excellent, lets go then.

642
01:19:39,321 --> 01:19:40,477
Thank you for understanding.

643
01:19:50,087 --> 01:19:54,452
From now on you're in hands
of Palestine Liberation Organization.

644
01:19:54,745 --> 01:20:01,005
What? Palestine?
And what's my connection with it?

645
01:20:01,681 --> 01:20:06,771
We rent apartments in Paris and
 i'm not a jew.

646
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:08,428
What's the difference?

647
01:20:10,584 --> 01:20:19,121
- You will pay me. I'm Jacques Mesrine.
- Mesrine? - right.

648
01:20:22,696 --> 01:20:25,266
How long am i gonna be here?

649
01:20:30,046 --> 01:20:35,239
Depends on you.
If you reach deep in your pockets you can go home.

650
01:20:37,188 --> 01:20:40,415
- How much do you need?
- 10 millions in cash.

651
01:20:41,743 --> 01:20:43,417
- 10 millions?
- Yeah.

652
01:20:43,503 --> 01:20:54,525
What are... 10 millions is too much.
I'll dissapoint you, but i'm 82 years old. I rather be killed.

653
01:21:03,068 --> 01:21:10,229
- Then give us eight.
- No. - I didn't understand. - No.

654
01:21:11,039 --> 01:21:12,920
Do you think we are morons, you old fart?

655
01:21:15,128 --> 01:21:17,372
- Seven and we go separate ways for good!
- No!

656
01:21:18,493 --> 01:21:26,305
- How much can you pay me then, you penny pincher?
- Six... in four payments.

657
01:21:26,516 --> 01:21:29,794
Aha, in four payments?! In four!

658
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:35,529
So, you'll pay in three payments 
and if you try to screw me,

659
01:21:35,636 --> 01:21:40,778
 i put the bullet in you, for free! Got it?
- Yes.

660
01:21:41,485 --> 01:21:43,987
- Did you get it?
- Yes, i did.

661
01:21:46,764 --> 01:21:48,438
Right word of obedient old man.

662
01:21:51,008 --> 01:21:56,409
Excellent, realy good cognac.
We are not that different Mr. Mesrine.

663
01:21:56,702 --> 01:22:00,892
We both like good things and to get them,

664
01:22:01,257 --> 01:22:08,521
we have to steal from honest hard 
working man. And why not?

665
01:22:10,056 --> 01:22:15,560
What are you talking about? We've got nothing in common.
You are an exploiter and i'm a revolutionary.

666
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:17,010
It's not the same thing.

667
01:22:19,528 --> 01:22:26,195
- Mr. Mesrine, what's the difference 
between a revolutionary and gangster? 
- What is it, a riddle?

668
01:22:26,826 --> 01:22:35,643
A Revolutionary would already put a bullet in my head
and left my body in a trunk of some car,

669
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:45,995
in the meanwhile gangster needs a ransom,
he wants the money and then he let me go free.

670
01:22:46,702 --> 01:22:48,376
Will you do it too?

671
01:22:51,153 --> 01:22:52,827
You forgot the third option.

672
01:22:55,242 --> 01:22:59,349
I'll take your money, put a bullet in your head
and i put you in a trunk.

673
01:23:00,677 --> 01:23:04,214
- How about that?
- In that case, everything they write abou you in newspapers,

674
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:11,875
Mesrine is honorable gangster,
he stands behind his word, all of it is just crap.

675
01:23:15,066 --> 01:23:18,293
- Jacques, look!<i>
...accomplice of wanted Jacques Mesrine,</i>

676
01:23:18,379 --> 01:23:22,641
<i>François Besse, with whom he escaped 
from prison in De la Santé.</i>

677
01:23:22,642 --> 01:23:23,677

<i>After a few months Besse
parted ways with the Public enemy Nbr.1</i>

679

<i>Belgian police arrested Bessa

<i>in cooperation with french counter-terrorist agency.</i>

681
01:23:37,944 --> 01:23:41,999
Belgian police...
- Only the biggest moron...

682
01:23:42,085 --> 01:23:44,484
could get caught by belgian cops.

683
01:23:47,054 --> 01:23:50,281
As i know him he won't stay 
there for too long.

684
01:23:54,507 --> 01:23:56,802
Your excellency, i invite you to the table.

685
01:24:06,205 --> 01:24:09,432
- For now it's calm, nothing is happening.
- Have a look.

686
01:24:15,211 --> 01:24:20,612
- We've been stuck here for too long. When will we go to get the money?
- Let him wait. It's better to wait...

687
01:25:01,588 --> 01:25:05,850
- Wait, somebody stopped next to Lefebvre's car.
  Let me see.

688
01:25:11,371 --> 01:25:13,200
Asshole, i saw it.

689
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:16,409
They're cops, scumbags.

690
01:25:18,669 --> 01:25:23,448
Let's test the toughness of their glasses.

691
01:25:26,019 --> 01:25:29,763
So you brought the cops?
Here you go!

692
01:25:36,578 --> 01:25:40,115
You wanted to screw me!
Just wait.

693
01:25:57,385 --> 01:25:59,577
Let's split. Move it!

694
01:26:21,505 --> 01:26:23,904
Your shitty son double crossed me,
he talked to cops!

695
01:26:29,476 --> 01:26:32,186
I swear, it won't happen again.

696
01:26:39,725 --> 01:26:43,676
It's in your interest,
trust me.

697
01:27:01,982 --> 01:27:05,622
I have two good news.

698
01:27:07,779 --> 01:27:12,041
First: old grandpa can go back home
because his famous son...

699
01:27:12,955 --> 01:27:18,562
paid first payment of ransom.
And second news... watch...

One, two, three... cheese.

702
01:27:32,934 --> 01:27:33,987
Done.

703
01:27:37,592 --> 01:27:38,542
Here!

704
01:27:40,905 --> 01:27:43,200

705
01:27:57,365 --> 01:27:59,660

706
01:27:59,746 --> 01:28:02,693

709

Move!

710
01:28:49,539 --> 01:28:50,798
Where are the cops?

711
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:00,219
And here we are.

712
01:29:26,495 --> 01:29:27,651
Try that one.

713
01:29:33,845 --> 01:29:35,001
How much is it?

714
01:29:44,197 --> 01:29:46,388
- I give up.
- You're under arrest.

715
01:29:47,302 --> 01:29:48,459
Do you like it?

716
01:29:49,269 --> 01:29:50,219
Here you go.

717

718
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:13,304
<i>the only thing was on his mind, how to escape,
because he always needs...</i>

<i>to draw attention on himself and confirm
his reputation as "The Public Enemy nbr.1".</i>

720

<i>Paris, August of 1979.</i>

721
01:30:38,027 --> 01:30:39,080
Charly!

722
01:30:41,961 --> 01:30:43,785
Charly Bauer, invisible man.

723
01:30:46,102 --> 01:30:50,467
- It's not easy to get together with you.
- You know, i have so little time, Jacques.

724
01:30:50,657 --> 01:30:53,780
Organization, comrades to which 
i report...

725
01:30:54,487 --> 01:31:00,405
I completely forgot, your ultra-left
comrades want to thank you...

726
01:31:00,491 --> 01:31:06,202
something to drink, to eat, to go out. Is it true?
- You think, you destroy the system by yourself?

727
01:31:07,013 --> 01:31:10,550
No, i don't think so, i know so.
I know what i am doing.

728
01:31:11,619 --> 01:31:13,448
Have you read the newspapers? And my book?

729
01:31:13,503 --> 01:31:19,867
- Have you read my book?
- Some parts. And not all of it i liked,

730
01:31:20,884 --> 01:31:23,800
because there's nothing in it I could relate to.

731
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:25,974
nor what i fight for...

732
01:31:26,371 --> 01:31:27,734
I tell it to you this way,

733
01:31:27,924 --> 01:31:33,014
if we've met during the war in Algeria,
we would fight against each other.

734
01:31:34,497 --> 01:31:40,157
- I know that and i would kill you.
- Don't be mistaken,

735
01:31:40,346 --> 01:31:42,776
just because you and me don't have anything...

736
01:31:49,042 --> 01:31:54,753
Ok... i've to go
home, to my family.

737
01:31:55,046 --> 01:31:57,341
- Keep in touch.
- Yeah.

738
01:32:07,675 --> 01:32:13,593
- If you need something don't be shy.
- It'll happen soon, friend.

739
01:32:20,822 --> 01:32:26,823
What kind of moves are these? What?
Where are your manners?

740
01:32:27,654 --> 01:32:30,881
- What manners?
- Shaking your butt in front of my friend.

741
01:32:39,663 --> 01:32:43,614
- What should i say to you. You're just a cheap whore.
- What's that?

742
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:50,550
- Should I remind you where i bought you?
- You bought me? Nobody ever bought me!

743
01:32:51,412 --> 01:32:55,519
- Anybody with some extra money.
- I said that nobody ever paid for me!

744
01:32:55,812 --> 01:32:58,935
I'll never be bought!
If you'd just appreciate me a little bit,

745
01:32:59,021 --> 01:33:02,351
you wouldn't talk like that.
- You talk about respect? Come here!

746
01:33:03,524 --> 01:33:07,217
You're going talk about respect?
And the same time you're acting like a whore 
in front of my friend!

747
01:33:07,302 --> 01:33:09,598
- What friend?
- Shut up! Listen to me.

748
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:14,359
He was in jail with me. In jail!
And that's enough.

749
01:33:20,242 --> 01:33:26,782
François was your friend, but you always must have
the last word, that's why you're alone!

750
01:33:28,628 --> 01:33:31,026
That's how you end up...  completely alone!

751
01:33:34,839 --> 01:33:43,138
- Why? You want to leave me?
- What are you talking about?

752
01:33:44,363 --> 01:33:49,039
- Sylvia, you don't love me anymore?
- Leave me alone.

753
01:33:49,228 --> 01:33:53,490
- Don't you love me anymore?
- I want us to leave. To leave.

754
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:56,906
- We'll leave, honey.
- You always lie. - No, i don't.

755
01:33:57,199 --> 01:34:02,910
We won't go anywhere, they'll kill you. You will
get killed. - No, nobody will die.

756
01:34:04,756 --> 01:34:09,432
- Promise it. Promise it!
- I promise you, no one will die.

757
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:30,053
- Charly.
- Hi.

758
01:34:33,017 --> 01:34:36,554
Hey you little. My little man.

759
01:34:41,298 --> 01:34:43,697
You're my little man.

760
01:34:46,474 --> 01:34:49,598
No, that's not your mom.
Dear, take a care of visitors.

761
01:34:53,721 --> 01:34:58,914
Awful conditions and at the same time an effort
to break you down, humiliate you.

762
01:34:59,725 --> 01:35:03,883
That's true. They lock you up so they can 
make an animal out of you, living dead.

763
01:35:04,073 --> 01:35:06,471
We need to end this repressive, agressive system,

764
01:35:06,505 --> 01:35:08,873
whos existence is based on judgements.

765
01:35:09,766 --> 01:35:12,475
Are you aware, that gilotine compared to prison
with maximum security...

766
01:35:12,561 --> 01:35:14,370
it's like amnesty?

767
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:21,916
1) blow up the prison
2) free up our comrades

768
01:35:22,913 --> 01:35:24,898
3) build an army together.

769
01:35:25,294 --> 01:35:28,759
Do you want to screw the system?
Then you're only pickpocketing thief.

770
01:35:29,435 --> 01:35:33,179
- The need to rob from banks and not...
- Banks will always be around.

771
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:41,357
What are you doing with the money after robberies?
You're buying expensive jewelry for your girl
 and cars for yourself.

772
01:35:42,375 --> 01:35:47,393
Actually you're not fighting the system
but you're supporting it.

773
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:55,364
- I escaped from prison many times.
- How many times did you get caught?

774
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:59,059
- Have you given any thought to it?
- They won't get me anymore.

775
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:03,438
They'll have to kill me.
They won't have any other choice.

776
01:36:04,476 --> 01:36:07,993
Otherwise I'm going to die by natural death.

777
01:36:11,050 --> 01:36:12,517
Honey! Where you going?

778
01:36:13,565 --> 01:36:17,429
- Well, well.
- I can't talk about anything in front of her.

779
01:36:18,607 --> 01:36:22,041
She would cut my balls.

780
01:36:34,083 --> 01:36:36,461
- What are you doing?
- I want to scatter the smoke.

781
01:36:37,033 --> 01:36:41,326
- It's bad for your health.
- Stop it! You think you'll get killed by cigars?

782
01:36:42,468 --> 01:36:43,469
You never know.

783
01:37:00,066 --> 01:37:10,726
- Tell me you're happy.
- I'd like to go away from here.

784
01:37:12,903 --> 01:37:17,320
We stay for a little while and 
then we leave this country.

785
01:37:20,770 --> 01:37:26,461
Don't worry if we stay together,
nothing will happen to us.

786
01:37:28,845 --> 01:37:29,970
We love each other forever.

787
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:35,436
You're my treasure.

788
01:37:38,317 --> 01:37:41,751
- I love you.
- I love you too.

789
01:37:50,739 --> 01:37:52,103
That's Charly.

790
01:38:08,389 --> 01:38:13,459
- Do you know Dallier? Jacques Dallier?
- Fascist journalist.

791
01:38:14,549 --> 01:38:19,742
Corrupted journalist who works for 
miniscule newspapers...

792
01:38:23,348 --> 01:38:26,782
Read it. Read! 
Read it out loud!

793
01:38:28,524 --> 01:38:34,577
- "Mesrine, gangster without a bit of honor".
- He writes about me!

794
01:38:37,789 --> 01:38:43,065
"The kind who doesn't stand behind his word
and snitches on his friends". 
Asshole!

795
01:38:46,743 --> 01:38:49,660
So what do you intend?

796
01:39:53,928 --> 01:39:55,084
Let's go.

797
01:40:55,108 --> 01:40:56,885
In the car! Get in the car!

798
01:41:01,164 --> 01:41:02,061
Charly!

799
01:41:17,582 --> 01:41:23,397
Reveal to me, your newspapers "Minute"
are they only for prisons with special regime?

800
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:28,883
"Minute" are too extreme. As soon as i get the money for interview
i'll go to live on an island.

801
01:41:29,073 --> 01:41:33,438
An island?
And why not a french countryside?

802
01:41:33,938 --> 01:41:42,786
French? Maybe when France was proud and respected...
But then, in 40's it surrendered to Hitler

803
01:41:43,359 --> 01:41:48,345
and 20 years later to strong Africa and Arabs too.

804
01:41:48,431 --> 01:41:52,279
- So you think Algerie doesn't belong to algerians?
- And America belongs to indians?

805
01:41:54,228 --> 01:41:57,072
Who makes the country strong, savage or white man?

806
01:42:00,491 --> 01:42:07,910
- You used to be a cop. What do you think about them?
- They're idiots, bunch of scumbags.

807
01:42:09,239 --> 01:42:13,604
You should see how he crawls around you
big Jacques here, Mesrine there,

808
01:42:13,897 --> 01:42:15,364
despise them.

809
01:42:16,702 --> 01:42:21,689
In october of 1961 police was completely different.
Knew how to stand up to criminals.

810
01:42:21,982 --> 01:42:30,847
But back then they had old Papón.
He was a powerful director.

811
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:39,940
If it would be you i would take care of
 Broussard. He intends something with your daughter.

812
01:42:41,547 --> 01:42:46,741
- You think he's capable of it?
- What do i know what these types are capable of?

813
01:42:48,587 --> 01:42:56,886
- That's true. And what plans they have regarding me?
- They want to kill you.

814
01:42:58,808 --> 01:43:00,016
I'm sure about that.

815
01:43:25,878 --> 01:43:26,828
Wait here!

816
01:44:00,143 --> 01:44:02,749
- Do you want a piece of gum?
- No.

817
01:44:22,504 --> 01:44:24,074
Kalashnikov is good weapon.

818
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:29,043
- Dallier!
- Go.

819
01:44:35,858 --> 01:44:36,807
Here you go.

820
01:44:40,412 --> 01:44:41,362
Go!

821
01:44:58,580 --> 01:44:59,581
This way.

822
01:45:00,599 --> 01:45:04,343
Go, keep going! Quickly! Move!

823
01:45:31,758 --> 01:45:33,122
Do we start the interview?

824
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:42,366
I will speak to Jacques Mesrine
who's ready to answer my questions.

825
01:45:44,232 --> 01:45:46,165
- Are you Jacques Mesrine?
- Maybe I am.

826
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:48,753
So, you are Jacques Mesrine.

827
01:45:53,239 --> 01:45:57,345
I don't know what you have been told,
but you seem nervous.

828
01:45:58,259 --> 01:46:00,347
- Are you scared of something?
- It only seems to you.

829
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,420
You're not comfortable.

830
01:46:10,578 --> 01:46:13,318
- I'm shocked.
- Why are you shocked?

831
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:15,461
After all you came to do interview with me.

832
01:46:17,038 --> 01:46:18,981
Have you kidnapped Mr. Lelievre?

833
01:46:23,414 --> 01:46:27,469
- Put the microphone down. 
- What's that?
- I told you to put the microphone down!

834
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:32,128
Take all of your clothes off!
You want interview? We do it right now.

835
01:46:33,352 --> 01:46:36,890
But first we have to see you.
Let's go, get undressed! Take them off!

836
01:46:38,735 --> 01:46:41,061
So we see you came here 
for an interview.

837
01:46:41,427 --> 01:46:45,306
Take them off! They could think you belong to us,
but you don't.

838
01:46:45,775 --> 01:46:48,204
- But you said that...
- Move!

839
01:46:51,572 --> 01:46:53,898
- You always need a material, aren't you?
- What do you mean?

840
01:46:55,661 --> 01:46:58,318
And then we put handcuffs.

841
01:46:59,025 --> 01:47:05,492
- And now, my dear... we'll play.
- Hands! Hands behind your back!

842
01:47:05,806 --> 01:47:08,080
- Mesrine, we are...
- Shut up! I'm talking now!

843
01:47:09,118 --> 01:47:10,741
- Listen to me...
- Shut up!

844
01:47:12,069 --> 01:47:16,776
I explain to you what we're going to do.
Dallier won't be doing the interview...

845
01:47:18,383 --> 01:47:23,784
...but Jacques Mesrine will ask the questions.
- Wait, don't do it!

846
01:47:25,682 --> 01:47:31,890
- What's your name?!   What? 
- Your name!
- Jacques Dallier.

847
01:47:32,669 --> 01:47:37,894
Jacques Dallier. That's right, Dallier.
That's the name of this dirt!

848
01:47:41,313 --> 01:47:44,902
- Who do you work for? What cheap newspapers you work for?
- "Minute".

849
01:47:46,955 --> 01:47:51,869
- What? 
- "Minute".
- Oh yes, for "Minute", the fascist newspapers.

850
01:47:55,254 --> 01:48:00,458
Did you write this? Did you write an article 
about me? It is your article, isn't it?

851
01:48:00,619 --> 01:48:03,811
- That's not my article.
- I advise you, you better don't lie to me.

852
01:48:05,795 --> 01:48:09,674
That was you! You wrote the article!

853
01:48:14,077 --> 01:48:17,744
What? You wrote that i'm not honest
to my friends!

854
01:48:21,582 --> 01:48:24,581
I don't deal with my friends like that.
You tarnished me!

855
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:32,418
My friend is here. Ask him if i'm honest man!

856
01:48:33,642 --> 01:48:35,006
If I'm honest!

857
01:48:36,748 --> 01:48:41,765
Journalists, who talk shit about me,
i break their neck! I break it!

858
01:48:55,278 --> 01:49:01,020
I show you how we used to do it in Algerie.
Look! You die, you asshole!

859
01:49:01,178 --> 01:49:04,747
That's enough. Stop!
Don't be a fascist like him!

860
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:11,269
Stop!
If you want to, shoot him and let's end this.

861
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:12,305
You right.

862
01:49:21,779 --> 01:49:23,970
Not necessary! We already made too much noise.

863
01:49:26,851 --> 01:49:28,008
Anyway he's dead.

864
01:49:37,756 --> 01:49:39,534
- You read the papers?
- Why?

865
01:49:40,862 --> 01:49:46,055
- That dick Dallier is alive. Would you believe it?
- He's alive? So? Only better.

866
01:49:46,245 --> 01:49:50,507
Better? What's so better about it? It's a disaster!
I told you not to send the photograph.

867
01:49:50,541 --> 01:49:52,784
Even journalists, your followers
are shocked!

868
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:59,823
He wasn't even a reporter, just a regular snitch.

869
01:50:00,530 --> 01:50:07,794
Judge however you want. You pissed off 
journalists! You attacked one of them!

870
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:13,074
- Oh, one of them. So what? Just one.
- Read what the press is writing.

871
01:50:13,988 --> 01:50:19,492
From now on, my friend,
bear the repercussions yourself.

872
01:50:28,481 --> 01:50:33,881
<i>Hi my love. If you're listening this cassette
my little Sylvia,</i>

873
01:50:34,123 --> 01:50:40,921
<i>i won't be here. It's only my voice,
my voice for your remembrance .</i>

874
01:50:42,611 --> 01:50:47,304
<i>That's the way it is my baby, your man is dead.
He was shot in barrage of police bullets.</i>

875
01:50:48,149 --> 01:50:54,585
<i>You know kitty, the man who chose
the life of war, robberies,</i>

876
01:50:56,897 --> 01:50:58,726
<i>won't die by a natural death.</i>

877
01:51:01,607 --> 01:51:07,142
<i>At the end, it's not important
if i died alone or in police fire.</i>

878
01:51:07,715 --> 01:51:15,186
<i>My death is like meaningless airplane catastrophy
or unfortunate coincidence.</i>

879
01:51:17,394 --> 01:51:20,569
<i>You know, death doesn't even exist.</i>

880
01:51:21,897 --> 01:51:24,934
<i>Death doesn't mean anything for someone
who knew how to live.</i>

881
01:51:25,417 --> 01:51:29,886
<i>I can say I didn't waste my life.</i>

882
01:51:30,489 --> 01:51:35,993
<i>A love for the law didn't work out,
but i had other love...</i>

883
01:51:37,425 --> 01:51:39,720
<i>...a love for woman, for you .</i>

884
01:51:39,909 --> 01:51:43,478
<i>I became a gangster.
That was my choice.</i>

885
01:51:45,499 --> 01:51:49,037
<i>I chose such life ,
an easy one, a criminal one,</i>

886
01:51:49,847 --> 01:51:54,865
<i>my victims have always been 
or almost always been a filthy rich.</i>

887
01:51:59,475 --> 01:52:03,346
<i>After death i won't be guilty any more,
because i'll pay for everything.</i>

888
01:52:03,926 --> 01:52:08,426
<i>It's weird, people think of you as hero.</i>

889
01:52:09,309 --> 01:52:12,639
<i>but honestly, in the world of gangsters
heros don't exist.</i>

890
01:52:13,036 --> 01:52:16,538
<i>In this world there are only people,
who live outside of the law.</i>

891
01:52:17,176 --> 01:52:20,610
<i>I would die with gun in my hand even
