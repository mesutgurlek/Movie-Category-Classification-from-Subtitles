00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,190
Dedicated to Monogram Pictures

2
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,390
After all, l'm an arsehole.

3
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,510
After all, yes, l must. l must!

4
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,390
Take me with you!

5
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,670
- What time is it?
- 1 0:50.

6
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,640
l'm on my way, hey hey!

7
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,110
lf he thinks he's gonna pass me
in his bloody Renault!

8
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,190
l get the dough,

9
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,510
l ask Patricia, yes or no,

10
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,280
and then...

11
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,960
The countryside's nice.

12
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,720
l really like France.

13
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,560
lf you don't like the shore...

14
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,910
lf you don't like the mountains...

15
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,560
lf you don't like the city...

16
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,680
Then get stuffed!

17
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,630
Little girls trying to hitch a ride!

18
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,910
l'll charge a kiss per mile.

19
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,600
The short one's not bad. Nice thighs.

20
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,470
Yeah, but the other one...

21
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,120
Oh, hell, they're dogs.

22
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,000
The sun's great.

23
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,840
Women drivers
are cowardice personified!

24
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,960
Overtake him!

25
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,910
Shit, roadworks!

26
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,560
Never use the brakes.

27
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,430
As old man Bugatti said:
''My cars are made to run, not to stop''.

28
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,310
Shit! The pigs!

29
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,030
Contact's gone!

30
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,230
A boobytrap!

31
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,270
Freeze!

32
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,430
- Miss Franchini's room?
- She isn't here.

33
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,310
- She live here?
- She's out.

34
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,590
Girls never have a penny!

35
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,670
Coffee.

36
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,950
- How much is a ham and eggs?
- 1 80 F.

37
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,110
Make it one.

38
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,750
Just going for a paper.

39
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,110
Can l come in?

40
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,830
How's it going, precious?

41
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,590
No jacket?

42
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,070
lt's in my Alfa Romeo.

43
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,910
- Want breakfast at the Royal?
- l'm late.

44
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,470
Gotta be at the TV station by 9.

45
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,230
lt's torn.

46
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,550
What've you been up to?

47
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,030
Nothing, l've been travelling.

48
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,110
- What's new around here?
- Dunno.

49
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:40,230
- You don't go out?
- To the discotheque sometimes.

50
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,950
Still making films?

51
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,350
No. You gotta sleep around.

52
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,350
Do you recollect Enrico?

53
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,950
''Remember'' or ''recall''.
But not ''recollect''.

54
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,910
l work with him at the station.
As script-girl.

55
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,750
When l was broke in December
l was assistant on a picture

56
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,950
at Cinecitta!

57
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,750
- You?
- Yes, me.

58
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,550
Ever been a gigolo?

59
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,070
Why?

60
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,430
Just asking.

61
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,910
l wouldn't mind.

62
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,590
Call me back in a few minutes.

63
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,430
ls Gaby back from Spain?

64
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,590
He's bought the Pergola.

65
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,150
Great.

66
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,110
lt was stupid to paint it all black.

67
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,030
- What's it say there?
- ''Why?''

68
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,510
l smoke Luckies now.

69
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,430
Can you lend me 5000 francs till noon?

70
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,790
l might have known.

71
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,750
You're a louse, Michel.

72
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,270
l'll pay you back.

73
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,470
l'm short.

74
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,270
- Here's 500 if you want.
- No, keep it.

75
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,870
- So, no breakfast at the Royal?
- Thanks, but l'm late.

76
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,270
ls Mr. Tolmachov here?

77
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,470
He's here, but he's not here.

78
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,550
Seen Patricia?

79
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,670
Come with me to Rome?

80
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,790
lt's crazy, but l love you.

81
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,030
l wanted to see
if l'd be glad to see you again.

82
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,110
Where have you been?
Monte Carlo?

83
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,550
No, Marseilles.
There was a chap l had to see.

84
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,470
l tried calling you Monday.

85
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,830
l was out of town Monday.

86
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,750
- l'll take one.
- That's kind of you.

87
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,550
What are you doing here?
l thought you hated Paris.

88
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,110
No, but l've got enemies here.

89
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,870
So you're in danger?

90
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,390
Yeah. Will you come to Rome with me?

91
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,070
To do what?

92
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,470
We'll see.

93
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,030
No, l've got lots to do here.

94
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,510
You going up or down the Champs?

95
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,270
- What's the ''Champs''?
- The Champs Elysees.

96
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,870
l've gotta be on Ave George V.
- OK, see you, then.

97
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,990
C'mon, walk me.

98
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,350
Just to the corner.

99
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,670
- Take it back, no horoscope!
- What's ''horoscope''?

100
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,910
The future. l wanna know
the future. Don't you?

101
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,270
Sure.

102
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,230
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, just looking at you.

103
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,590
You're angry l left without a goodbye.

104
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,550
No, l was furious because l was sad.

105
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,630
lt's nice to wake up next to a girl.

106
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,070
Are you staying in town?

107
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,150
Yeah, l have to see a man
who owes me money.

108
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,870
Then l have to see you.

109
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,870
You don't have to.

110
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,910
Why?

111
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,990
There are prettier girls than me here.

112
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,630
No. lt's odd,
l slept with 2 girls since you.

113
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,270
lt was a washout.

114
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,830
What's a ''washout''?

115
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:53,630
They were very pretty,
but it was a washout. lt was glum.

116
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,630
So will you come to Rome?
l'm fed up with France.

117
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,310
l can't, Michel.

118
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:02,470
l have to enrol in the Sorbonne
or my parents stop sending money.

119
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,070
- l've got money.
- We only had 3 nights together!

120
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,430
No, 5.

121
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,070
- Why don't you wear a bra?
- Don't talk like that!

122
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,430
OK, sorry!

123
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,670
What time is it? See you later?

124
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,590
Not later. Tonight, if you like.

125
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,110
- Where?
- Here.

126
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,710
Live dangerously until the end!

127
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,590
Have you anything against youth?

128
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,190
Sure do. l prefer old people.

129
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,790
Police killer identified

130
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,390
Mr. Tolmachov here?

131
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,630
At the airline desk.

132
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,390
- Hi, amigo.
- Hi, sonny.

133
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,110
Was it you who came by at 1 0?

134
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,430
Yeah, for my money.

135
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,190
lt's ready for you.

136
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,510
- How're things?
- l got bored down south.

137
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,710
l came up to see a girl.
And you?

138
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,230
l'm getting out of here.
l'm rusting away.

139
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,590
Better rusted than busted.

140
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,910
Over here.

141
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,470
Have the envelope l gave you?

142
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,430
Why'd the arsehole cross it?

143
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,310
Sign it over to someone else.

144
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,950
Not to me.
l blew my last penny on the races.

145
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,190
And your pal, Bob Montagne?

146
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,390
- He's in the slammer.
- No kidding?

147
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,830
There's Berruti, but l don't trust him.

148
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,950
l thought he was your pal.

149
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,230
ls he back?

150
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,550
Yes, l saw him
in Montparnasse last night.

151
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,110
What's his number?

152
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,150
ELY. 99.84.

153
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,030
Can l call from here?

154
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,590
Who's the girl you came for?

155
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,350
A New Yorker.

156
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,510
Pretty?

157
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,870
She's amusing. l like her.

158
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,350
ELY. 99.84?

159
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,030

00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,110
l'll call back.

161
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,590
He's out. l'll try around.

162
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,950
- Bye, sonny.
- Ciao, amigo.

Yes, it's here.

165
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,710
Do customers have mail forwarded here?

166
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,470
Know a certain Michel Poiccard?

167
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,790
Also goes by the name Laszlo Kovacs?

168
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,790
Ask the gentleman over there.

169
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,590
lf it isn't Tolmachov!

170
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,430
Hello, lnspector.

171
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,750
ln the travel business now?

172
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,510
As you can see.

173
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:36,030
Remember how you ratted
on your friend Bob?

174
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,670
What of it?

175
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,150
Well, you're going to do it again.

176
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,550
Michel Poiccard, 5 ft. 9,

177
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,950
brown hair, former Air France steward.

178
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,150
He has his mail sent here.

179
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,670
Yes, l know him.

180
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,070
He been around lately?

181
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,430
Nobody been to see
Mr. Tolmachov recently?

182
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,590
Yes, just 5 minutes ago.
Quite a tall man.

183
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,630
Bloody hell!

184
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,950
Accessory to murder -
mean anything to you?

185
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,760
The Harder They Fall

186
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,110
Bogey...

187
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,280
- l saw a man die.
- Why did he die?

188
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,800
ln an accident.

189
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,150
Take me out to dinner?

190
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,950
Let me make another call first.
Wait for me?

191
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,630
Call from the restaurant.

192
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,150
l'll just be a second.

193
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,560
The French always say one second,
when they mean 5 minutes.

194
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,710
Where we going?

195
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,670
Anywhere... To Saint Michel.

196
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,320
- Sleep with me tonight?
- l don't know.

197
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,870
- Don't you like it with me?
- Sure, l do.

198
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,870
l just read something in the paper...

199
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,840
About a bus conductor...

200
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,520
he stole 5 million to seduce a girl.
lmpersonated a rich impresario.

201
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,430
He took her down to the Riviera.
They blew the lot in 3 days.

202
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:11,240
The chap didn't chicken out.
He told her:

203
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,000
''lt's stolen money, l'm a hood,
but l like you.''

204
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,320
What's great is that she stuck by him.
She said: ''l like you, too''.

205
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,240
They came back to Paris,

206
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,630
and were nabbed trying to burgle
some posh villas. She was the look-out.

207
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,080
Excuse me, got a light?

208
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,670
Here!
Go buy yourself some matches!

209
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,800
l'd totally forgotten!

210
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,390
- l have an appointment.
- Who with?

211
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:46,040
A journalist on the Champs Elysees.
We're going to a press conference.

212
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,560
Where? Now?

213
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,800
None of your business.
You can really get on my nerves.

214
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,950
So you're leaving me?

215
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,320
- But l'll see you tomorrow.
- Not tomorrow, tonight, Patricia.

216
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,390
l told you l can't.

217
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,760
Why are you so cruel?

218
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,480
Any taxis around?

219
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,560
My car's parked near the Opera.
Want a lift?

220
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,910
What happened to the Ford?

221
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,320
lt's in the garage.

222
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,280
Let me stay with you.

223
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,840
l've got a headache.

224
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,080
We won't make love.
l just wanna be with you.

225
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,840
That's not it, Michel!

226
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,840
Why are you so sad?

227
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,910
Because l am.

228
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,280
lt's silly.

229
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,190
Why are you so sad?

230
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,150
Should l use ''vous'' or ''tu''?

231
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,000
No difference...
But l can't do without you.

232
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,390
Yes, you can.

233
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,600
Maybe. But l don't want to.

234
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,710
Just look at that great Talbot.
A 2.5 litre.

235
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,280
- You're a kid...
- What?

236
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,240
Oh, l dunno.

237
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,480
Look at me.
l forbid you to meet this chap.

238
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,760
Alas, alas, alas!

239
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,150
l love a girl who has a nice neck,

240
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,110
nice breasts, a nice voice...

241
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,800
nice wrists...

242
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,320
a nice forehead...

243
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,080
nice knees...

244
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,710
But she's such a coward!

245
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,800
lt's right here. Stop.

246
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,320
- Let me park first.
- Don't bother.

247
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,150
Get lost!

248
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,080
l never want to see you again.

249
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,430
Get lost!

250
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,320
You louse!

251
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,190
lt'd be a shame
if that happened to you.

252
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,560
We'll see.

253
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,560
What's wrong?

254
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,280
lf l could dig a hole
and hide in it, l would.

255
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,950
You're better off being like elephants.
When they're sad...

256
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,080
Let me tell you a story.
lt'll take your mind off things.

257
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,040
l've known a girl 2 years.

258
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,670
And now, l suddenly think:
l'll ask her to sleep with me.

259
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,190
lt had never occurred to me.
We met for lunch.

260
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,840
l wanted to say:
We're friends, let's sleep together.

261
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,000
l don't know why,
but it completely slipped my mind!

262
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,320
Later l suddenly remembered
and sent her a telegram, saying

263
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,040
l'd forgotten to say
we should sleep together.

264
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,240
3 hours later l get
a message back, saying:

265
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,710
''What an amazing coincidence!

266
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:48,040
''l was going
to suggest the same thing!''

267
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,480
- ls this the late edition?
- Yes, sir.

268
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,710
Seen my key?

269
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:21,870
You must've left it in the door.

270
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,870
Oh, no!

271
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,840
What are you doing here?

272
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,600
The Claridge was booked solid.

273
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,480
So l came here.
l took the key downstairs.

274
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,390
There are other places
than the Claridge.

275
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:48,150
- l always stay at the Claridge.
- You're crazy!

276
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,600
Quit pulling a long face!

277
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,350
lt doesn't suit you.

278
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:59,430
- ''Pulling a long face''?
- Doing like this!

279
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,350
lt suits me fine.

280
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,150
You're even crazier than me.

281
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,520
What a pain.

282
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:17,110
l always fall for girls
who aren't cut out for me.

283
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:21,240
Did you notice
l followed you last night?

284
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,240
What's wrong?

285
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,950
Leave me alone. l'm thinking.

286
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,280
What about?

287
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,600
The thing is, l don't even know.

288
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,110
Well, l do.

289
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,480
No, nobody does.

290
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,870
You're thinking about last night.
Yes, you are.

291
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:48,000
Last night l was furious,
but now l couldn't care less.

292
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,760
l'm not thinking about anything.

293
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,190
l'd like to think about something,
but l can't seem to.

294
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,150
Well, l'm tired, very tired,

295
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:06,080
and l'm going back to sleep.

296
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,840
- Why're you looking at me?
- Because l am.

297
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,350
- You should've stayed last night.
- l couldn't.

298
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,630
You should've told the chap
you couldn't see him.

299
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,430
l had to.
He's getting me articles to write.

300
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,110
lt's really important for me.

301
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,150
No, what's important
is going to Rome with me.

302
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,600
Maybe, l don't know.

303
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,950
Did you sleep with him?

304
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,840
l bet you did.

305
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,630
No. He's really sweet.

306
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,390
He said one day we'd sleep together
but not now.

307
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,760
But he doesn't even know me.

308
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,710
Not you... Him and me.

309
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,560
We had a drink in Montparnasse.

310
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,080
l was there, too. At what time?

311
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,110
l don't know. We didn't stay long.

312
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,870
Why'd you come here, Michel?

313
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,950
Because l want to sleep
with you again.

314
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,600
That's hardly a reason.

315
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,710
Sure, it is. lt means l love you.

316
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:19,190
But l don't know if l love you yet.

317
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,150
When will you know?

318
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,350
Soon.

319
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:28,000
What do you mean: ''soon''?
ln a month, in a year?

320
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,040
Soon means soon.

321
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,600
A woman never wants to do
in 8 seconds

322
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,240
what she'll want to do
8 days later.

323
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,670
8 seconds or 8 days, it's all the same.

324
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:43,430
Why not 8 centuries?

325
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:46,000
No, 8 days is good.

326
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,240
A woman's all half-measures.

327
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,870
lt gets me down.

328
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,150
Why won't you sleep with me again?

329
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,800
Because l'm trying to find out

330
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,800
what it is that l like about you.

331
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,280
l want us to be like Romeo and Juliet.

332
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,240
Just like a girl!

333
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,800
See? You said last night you couldn't
live without me, but you can.

334
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,560
Romeo couldn't live without Juliet,
but you can.

335
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,760
No, l can't live without you.

336
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,150
Just like a man!

337
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,150
Give me a smile.

338
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:33,670
Right! l'll count to 8.

339
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:37,950
lf by 8 you haven't smiled,
l'll strangle you.

340
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,240
2...

341
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,870
3...

342
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,150
4, 5, 6...

343
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,950
7...

344
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,840
7 and a half...

345
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,950
7 and three quarters.

346
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:56,110
You're such a coward
l bet you're gonna smile.

347
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,080
Enough games for today.

348
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,870
Too bad you're a coward.

349
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,670
Why do you say that?

350
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,190
You get on my nerves.

351
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,240
You do, too.

352
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,800
l'm not a coward.

353
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,480
How do you know?

354
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,670
lf a girl says she's not scared,
then can't even light her cigarette,

355
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,520
it means she's scared of something.

356
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,190
l don't know of what,
but she's scared.

357
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,950
- Have one.
- None of those Chesterfields.

358
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,800
Hand me my jacket.

359
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,280
- ln this one?
- Give!

360
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,840
This your passport?

361
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,320
No, my brother's. Mine's in the car.

362
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,840
But it says Kovacs here.

363
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,840
Oh, yeah?
He's not my real brother.

364
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,040
My mum was divorced
by the time he was born.

365
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,950
See? l'm not scared.

366
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,320
- l never said you were.
- You bet, pet.

367
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,870
But you wish you had said it.
And now you're angry.

368
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,840
l'm not talking to you any more.

369
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,040
Do you ever think about death?

370
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,390
l do, all the time.

371
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,670
- What?
- Say something nice.

372
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,950
- Like what?
- l don't know.

373
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,630
Then neither do l.

374
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,150
l like your ashtray.

375
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,280
lt's Swiss.

376
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,190
My granddad had a Rolls-Royce.
Great car!

377
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,710
Never had to raise the bonnet
in 1 5 years!

378
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:59,350
Seen my new poster?

379
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,870
Come here!

380
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,430
Come here, for Christ's sake!

381
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:09,800
lt won't do here.
Where can l put it?

382
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,350
Why'd you slap me
when l looked at your legs?

383
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,710
lt wasn't my legs.

384
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,670
lt's exactly the same thing.

385
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:27,270
The French always say things
are the same when they're not at all.

386
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,150
l've thought of something nice.

387
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,310
What?

388
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:34,270
l want to sleep with you again

389
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,880
because you're beautiful.

390
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
l'm not.

391
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,520
Then because you're ugly.

392
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,880
ls it the same?

393
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,560
Yeah, kid, it's the same.

394
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,000
You're a liar, Michel.

395
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,360
No, lying's stupid.

396
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,920
lt's like at poker...
lt's better to tell the truth.

397
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:02,110
The others think you're bluffing,
and that's how you win.

398
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,480
What is it?

399
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,480
l'll stare at you
until you stop staring at me.

400
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,830
Me, too.

401
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,480
l'll put my poster in the bathroom.

402
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,670
Can l phone?

403
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,560
lt's not bad here.

404
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,670
Just fine.

405
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,920
You like my poster?

406
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,270
Not bad.

407
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,880
Renoir's a really great painter.

408
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,790
l said, not bad!

409
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,600
Think she's prettier than me?

410
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:21,270
When you're scared or surprised,
or both at once,

411
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,040
there's a funny glint in your eyes.

412
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,270
So what?

413
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:27,920
l wanna sleep with you again,
because of that glint.

414
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:36,230
Mind if l piss in the basin?

415
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,150
Guess what l'm going to say.

416
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,520
No idea.

417
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,040
l'm pregnant, Michel.

418
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,000
You heard me.

419
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,630
Whose is it? Mine?

420
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,150
l think so.

421
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,920
Seen a doctor?

422
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,790
Yesterday.

423
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,830
l have to go back Thursday
for tests.

424
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,480
You should've been more careful!

425
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:20,000
Get me ELY. 99.84.

426
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,830
ls Antonio there?

427
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,790
You don't know if he's coming back?

428
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,830
l'll call back.

429
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,400
ELY. 25.32.

430
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:54,040
l'm calling
the man who owes me money.

431
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,230
Mr. Tolmachov, please.

432
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,480
Hey, sonny.

433
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,040
l couldn't find Berruti.

434
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,670
l wandered
around Montparnasse all night.

435
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,880
The police?

436
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,520
Thanks. Ciao, sonny.

437
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Shit!

438
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,520
- What?
- l slipped.

439
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,440
Heard the one
about the condemned man?

440
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,600
As he's climbing the scaffold,
he slips and says, ''That figures!''

441
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,400
You look like a Martian up close.

442
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,230
Because my head's in the clouds.

443
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,360
Some idea, having a kid!

444
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,230
But it's not sure.

445
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,480
l wanted to see what you'd say.

446
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,670
- Take your clothes off.
- What's the point?

447
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,960
- You Americans are so stupid.
- Why?

448
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,920
You adore La Fayette
and Maurice Chevalier.

449
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,440
And they're the stupidest French!

450
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,630
l'm making another call.

451
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,830
Belle Epine 35.26.

452
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,880
Patricia, come here!

453
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,480
Mr. Mansard?

454
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,440
Will he be in this afternoon?
Tell him l'll come by.

455
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,600
l'm a friend of Tony's. From Marseilles.

456
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,190
l've got an American.

457
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,750
An American?

458
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:49,520
Not you. An American car.

459
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,000
l can't find the man
who owes me money. What a pain!

460
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,440
Do you prefer records or the radio?

461
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,520
Quiet, l'm thinking!

462
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,790
l know them all.

463
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,920
- How old are you?
- l'll put the radio on.

464
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,960
l'm 20.

465
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,880
You don't look it.

466
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,110
Why don't you like music?

467
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,360
lt depends. l do...

468
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,830
C'mon, Patricia, come to ltaly.

469
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:44,880
What's the point of studying
at the Sorbonne?

470
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,000
You never took any exams.

471
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,040
Sure, the baccalaureate.
But l packed it in.

472
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,830
What's ''packed it in''?

473
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,560
l did other things.

474
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,190
- Like what?
- l sold cars.

475
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,670
Here?

476
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,040
ln New York.

477
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,360
You sleep with a lot of men?

478
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,360
Not so many.

479
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,670
How many?

480
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,710
How about you?

481
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,670
Not so many either.

482
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:28,110
You know where l'd like to live?
Mexico.

483
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,150
l hear it's really lovely.

484
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:34,560
When l was a kid my dad would say:
We'll go next Saturday.

485
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,360
But he'd always forget.

486
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,560
No, Mexico doesn't grab me.

487
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,830
l bet it's not all that great.

488
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,150
People are such liars.

489
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,270
lt's like Stockholm. Everyone says...

490
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:54,360
''Swedish girls are terrific.
l had 3 a day. Go there.''

491
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,920
l went there. lt's not true.

492
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,920
Swedish girls don't act
the way they do here.

493
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,190
And most of them are dogs
like Parisian girls.

494
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,920
No, Swedish girls are very pretty.

495
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,880
lt's a myth.

496
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,000
One or two maybe - just like in Paris
or London - but not all of them.

497
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,230
The cities where the girls are pretty

498
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:24,400
- not gorgeous, but like you, charming -

499
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:32,440
girls who rate 1 5 out of 20, because
they have a certain something...

500
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:37,750
aren't Rome or Paris or Rio
but Lausanne and Geneva.

501
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,710
You tell me something nice, too.

502
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,750
l don't know what, either.

503
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,880
Would you let another man caress you?

504
00:42:56,110 --> 00:43:01,960
You know, you said l'm scared.
lt's true, l'm scared.

505
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,040
Because l want you to love me.

506
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,400
But at the same time,
l want you to stop loving me.

507
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,560
l'm very independent, you know.

508
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,670
l love you, but not the way you think.

509
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,790
- How then?
- Not the way you think.

510
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:26,920
But you don't know what l think.
You don't know.

511
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,400
- Sure, l do.
- But you don't.

512
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,960
l want to know
what's behind your face.

513
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,080
l've looked at it for 1 0 minutes now,
and l still know nothing, nothing.

514
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,230
l'm not sad. l'm scared.

515
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,270
Sweet, gentle Patricia.

516
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:54,270
OK, then, cruel, stupid, heartless,
pathetic, cowardly, despicable.

517
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,040
You don't even how
to apply your lipstick.

518
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,080
Now you're hideous.

519
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,830
Say what you like, l don't care.

520
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:06,360
l'll put all this in my book.

521
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,480
- What book?
- l'm writing a novel.

522
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,440
- You?
- Why not me? What are you doing?

523
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,960
Taking off your top.

524
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,600
Not now.

525
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,830
You're a bloody pain! What is all this?

526
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,710
You know William Faulkner?

527
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,750
No, who's he?
Someone you slept with?

528
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,230
No way, Jose!

529
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:31,110
To hell with him, then!

530
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,630
Take off your top.

531
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:36,400
He's one of my favourite writers.
Have you read ''Wild Palms''?

532
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,480
Take off your top, l said.

533
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,440
Listen. The last sentence is beautiful.

534
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,710
Which would you choose?

535
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,400
Let me see your toes.

536
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,190
Toes are important in a woman.
Don't laugh.

537
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,830
Which would you choose?

538
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:05,630
Griefs stupid.

539
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:07,360
l'd choose nothing.

540
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,830
lt's not better,

541
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,960
but griefs a compromise.

542
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,000
l want all or nothing.

543
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,750
And now l know.

544
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:20,360
Now l do.
What are you shutting your eyes for?

545
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,190
l'm shutting my eyes tight
so everything goes black.

546
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:28,150
But l can't do it.
lt's never entirely black.

547
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:29,520
Your smile...

548
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,230
seen in profile,
it's the nicest thing about you.

549
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,270
That's you.

550
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,630
That's me!

551
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:52,480
We look each other in the eyes,
but what for?

552
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,310
l hate that name.
l'd like to be called lngrid.

553
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,400
Sit on your haunches.

554
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:07,520
What's wrong?

555
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,040
l'm looking at you.

556
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,000
The French are stupid, too.

557
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,560
l want you to stay with me.

558
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:32,150
We interrupt our programming
in order to synchronise our networks.

559
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,960
Funny, l can see
my reflection in your eyes.

560
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,000
This is a real Franco-American
reconciliation.

561
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,630
We're like happy elephants in hiding.

562
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,710
A woman's hips are touching.

563
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,560
lt's hot under here.

564
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,440
lf it was another man caressing you,
would you mind?

565
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,920
You asked me that.

566
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:52,110
Do you know a book by Dylan Thomas,
''Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog''?

567
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,560
Sunday morning is most satisfyin'

568
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:01,080
To have a really long lie-in

569
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,440
l'm getting dressed.

570
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,710
- What time is it?
- Noon.

571
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,480
Was it good?

572
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,400
Let's stay in bed.

573
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,920
Nope, l've got to buy a dress.

574
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,270
- Got your car?
- Sure.

575
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:35,560
ELY. 99.84.

576
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,040
Did Antonio come by?

577
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,880
This is maddening!

578
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,830
You don't know where he is?

579
00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:01,000
No, never mind.

580
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,670
Michel Poiccard again.

581
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:05,360
Want me to wear a bra?

582
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,560
Which do you like best:
my eyes, my mouth or my shoulders?

583
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,960
lf you had to choose.

584
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,480
There was no press conference.

585
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,270
No, it's at Orly in a little while.

586
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:36,710
l'm not much of a looker,
but l'm quite a boxer!

587
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,110
Going to your press conference?

588
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:45,790
l have to drop by the office first.

589
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,310
l'll come with you.

590
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:49,520
Pres. Eisenhower,
with Gen. de Gaulle,

591
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,600
will lay a wreath
on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

592
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,600
Were you in the army?

593
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,480
What did you do?

594
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,600
l did in the sentries.

595
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,480
- ''Did in''?
- l laid them out flat.

596
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,000
Don't, Michel!

597
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,270
l'm exhausted. l'm gonna die.

598
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,110
You're crazy.

599
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:18,110
Yeah, totally barmy.

600
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,710
What's ''barmy''?

601
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:21,080
That's me.

602
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,790
Your car's not here?

603
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,750
lt's at the garage.
l'll go pick it up now.

604
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,310
Great, a Ford!

605
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,080
- What floor?
- Fifth.

606
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,150
l got the wrong floor.

607
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,710
Scared of getting old? l am.

608
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,480
You're a dope!

609
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:25,790
l told you, the worst flaw is cowardice.

610
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:30,000
Buy me a dress at Dior's?

611
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,080
Not on your life! There are
nicer dresses at Prix Unique.

612
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,600
You don't buy dresses at Dior,
you make calls.

613
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,440
lt's the only place
where you can phone for free.

614
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,880
There are 1 2 call boxes.

615
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,360
France Soir!

616
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,920
Police Killer Still At Large

617
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,710
How long will it last?

618
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,480
Half an hour or so.

619
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,630
l'll go and see my chap, then.

620
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:24,040
Why did you call
your novel ''Candidate''?

621
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:29,710
l'm convinced that the French
will give my book

622
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:33,520
a cool reception
because of their prudishness.

623
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,670
Mr Parvulesco!

624
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,150
Can one still believe
in love in our time?

625
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:46,960
Of course, especially in our time.

626
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:55,080
What about Rilke's saying: Modern life
increasingly separates men and women?

627
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:59,440
Rilke was a great poet,
he was probably right.

628
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:03,480
Out of my way!

629
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,790
You and your Pathe-Journal!

630
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:13,920
Do French and American women
differ in their romantic attitudes?

631
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,830
French women

632
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,670
are totally unlike Americans.

633
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:23,040
The American woman dominates the man.
The French doesn't dominate him yet.

634
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:28,150
What's your greatest ambition?

635
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:33,080
Who are more moral:
unfaithful women or deserting males?

636
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,040
Unfaithful women.

637
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,790
Are women more sentimental than men?

638
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:42,920
Feelings are a luxury
few women can afford.

639
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:48,880
ls there a difference
between eroticism and love?

640
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,110
No, not really.

641
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:57,190
l don't think so, because...

642
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:01,040
eroticism is a form of love,
and vice versa.

643
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,270
Does the soul exist in modern society?

644
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:14,400
Do women have a role to play
in modern society?

645
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,790
lf she's charming and wears
a striped dress and dark glasses.

646
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:21,360
Casanova said that there's no woman

647
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,110
who can't be seduced
with displays of gratitude.

648
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:26,920
Cocteau will answer that.

649
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,880
How many men can a woman
love in a lifetime?

650
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,190
Physically, l mean.

651
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,040
More than that!

652
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,670
Miss, you're in the shot.

653
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:47,480
Two things matter in life. For men,
it's women, and for women, money.

654
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,440
You're a pessimist!

655
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,440
lf you see a pretty girl
with a rich chap, you know

656
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,790
she's nice and he's a bastard.

657
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:01,150
Do you like Brahms?

658
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,750
Like everyone, no.

659
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,880
- And Chopin?
- Lousy!

660
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,230
What's your greatest ambition?

661
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:15,960
To become immortal and then die.

662
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:59,750
You're Claudius Mansard?

663
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,110
Yes, Mr. Kovacs.

664
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:05,440
l called this morning.
l was told you'd be here.

665
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,960
Yes, Mr Kovacs.

666
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,710
Tony sent me.

667
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:14,110
Didn't we meet in Nice?

668
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:17,000
Nobody phoned you?

669
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,520
Yes. But they said
it'd be an Oldsmobile.

670
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,150
lt fell through at the last minute.

671
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:25,110
And so?

672
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,480
So, it's this.

673
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,440
800,000.

674
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:46,710
But l'll only have the money next week.

675
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:48,960
You bastard!

676
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,960
And you, Mr Kovacs? Who are you?

677
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:56,150
So what?

678
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:59,600
So you don't get the money now.

679
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,080
- Tough. ls it 3 yet?
- Quarter past.

680
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,880
Can l use the phone?

681
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,830
ls Antonio there?

682
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:24,360
He just left.

683
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,480
Bloody hell!

684
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,560
He said to meet him
at the Escale at 4.

685
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,750
The Escale at 4. OK, thanks.

686
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,440
Don't bother.
l carry my cash on me.

687
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,040
Lend me 1 0,000.

688
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,440
5000.

689
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,960
2500.

690
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,600
She's not running?

691
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,040
Hey, you!

692
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:03,080
You remove the distributor cap?

693
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:08,920
- You owe me a phone call!
- For a taxi!

694
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:12,750
Step on it! Step on it!

695
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,960
Never mind the pedestrians!
Just hurry up!

696
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,190
Step on it, for Christ's sake!

697
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:24,190
The Thunderbird's left wing torn off!
Me, not a scratch!

698
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,560
That's where l was born.

699
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:32,040
Look at the eyesore they built opposite!

700
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:36,710
Houses like that get me down.
They ruin the whole square.

701
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:40,920
l have a feeling for beauty, Beauty.

702
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,400
lf we're late it's your fault.

703
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,920
Certainly not.

704
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,830
Overtake that Peugeot!

705
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:50,360
Don't change gears!

706
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:55,630
Don't brake for a 4CV!
You're being overtaken by a scooter!

707
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:58,440
Take the next left!

708
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,830
Wait. l'll be back.

709
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:30,920
He left 5 minutes ago.

710
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,630
The friend who owes you money?

711
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:37,790
Antonio Berruti, yeah,
and it's your fault.

712
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:39,830
Now it's double or quits.

713
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:42,040
- Why?
- Tell you later.

714
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,040
Overtake that 2CV.

715
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,880
- Where you going?
- To the New York Herald.

716
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,480
Eyes on the road!

717
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,040
Why bother writing?

718
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:53,750
To have money and not rely on men.

719
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:57,080
Paris girls look like tarts
in those short dresses.

720
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,920
Makes me wanna run up behind them
and do like this...

721
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,480
Don't mind me!

722
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,880
- We'll be right back.
- OK.

723
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,750
- Not paying the fare?
- Fast!

724
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:27,440
- Where are we going?
- The Champs Elysees.

725
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,400
l hate taxi-drivers who are afraid
their car'll get scratched.

726
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,750
The Gestapo put up a wall here

727
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,920
so nobody could escape them.

728
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,440
l've been thinking about that girl.

729
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,710
What girl?

730
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:42,790
The one with that chap on the Riviera.

731
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:45,360
You said you admired her.

732
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:49,230
Yeah, an ordinary girl. That's rare.

733
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:53,710
Come with me to the paper?

734
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:55,520
No, l've a call to make.

735
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,750
l'm going to see my tailor.
l'll pick you up later.

736
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:00,520
Ciao, kid!

737
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:23,920
You're late. They're waiting.

738
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:51,920
Over there.

739
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,520
You speak French?

740
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,600
Do you know this man?

741
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:35,110
Careful, little girl,
don't mess with the Paris police.

742
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,830
Yes, it's Michel.

743
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:42,310
l didn't recognise him.
lt's an old photo.

744
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:46,560
You were seen with him
this morning just outside.

745
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:47,480
Who saw me?

746
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:52,960
He was driving
a Ford Thunderbird, 3382 GM 75.

747
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,190
Where is he?

748
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:57,080
l don't know.

749
01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:01,960
Watch it,
watch what you say, little girl!

750
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:04,480
l've seen him five or six times.

751
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:09,790
l found him nice. l don't know
where he lives or what he does.

752
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:13,080
Known him long?

753
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:17,400
l met him 3 weeks ago in Nice.
l was on holiday.

754
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:21,230
He came to Paris to see someone
who owes him money.

755
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:25,190
- Who?
- l don't know. He had an ltalian name.

756
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,630
Think you'll see him again?

757
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:35,560
Maybe. Sometimes he calls me
and asks me out. Like this morning.

758
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:42,000
Got a work permit?

759
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,520
You don't want
any passport difficulties?

760
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,040
No, l don't.

761
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:49,080
So if you see him, here's my number.

762
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:55,080
Danton 01 .00.

763
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:39,550
President Eisenhower
is waving his arms...

764
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:47,270
Was that what you meant
by double or quits?

765
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:50,270
More or less.

766
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:52,590
Let's go see a western.

767
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:55,270
Yeah, better wait till dark.

768
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:08,790
Beware, Jessica

769
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:11,310
On the kiss's bevelled edge
Time is a void

770
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:14,830
Avoid, avoid
Memory's broken pledge

771
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:19,590
You're wrong, Sheriff

772
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:22,870
Your tale is noble and tragic
As the mask of a tyrant

773
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:27,230
No drama so perilous or magnetic
No detail can make our love pathetic

774
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,950
Hi, cutie!

775
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:51,750
Police closing in on Michel Poiccard.

776
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:55,230
- What's it say?
- l'm reading it.

777
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:57,550
The cops are stupid to be after me.

778
01:09:57,550 --> 01:10:00,390
l'm one of the few people
who like them.

779
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:04,950
Let me caress you.

780
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:07,390
Say something!

781
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:09,350
- Well!
- What?

782
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:12,150
- So you're married.
- Show me.

783
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:17,430
That was long ago.

784
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:19,910
She was crazy. She dumped me.

785
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:22,110
Or l dumped her. l can't remember.

786
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:24,710
l really like you, Michel.

787
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:27,750
What's it feel like,
riding in a stolen car?

788
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:30,350
- And killing a policeman?
- l was scared!

789
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:33,190
How did they know l knew you?

790
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:37,350
Someone must've seen us together
and gave us away.

791
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:39,270
- That's very bad.
- What is?

792
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:41,230
Giving people away.

793
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:44,710
No, it's normal. lnformers inform,

794
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:46,390
burglars burgle,

795
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:50,630
murderers murder, lovers love.

796
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:56,510
Look, isn't the Concorde gorgeous!

797
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:01,430
Yes, mysterious, with all the lights.

798
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:05,470
l was a fool to keep this car.
Gotta switch.

799
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:08,430
- What?
- Switch cars.

800
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:23,230
Let's steal the Cadillac.

801
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:27,590
What about the keys?

802
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:31,670
You drive, l hide.
They leave the keys in the car here.

803
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:40,070
- What do l tell the man?
- Say goodnight... in English.

804
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:43,590
He won't say a thing.
The French are yellow-bellied.

805
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,110
''Yellow-bellied''?

806
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:47,830
Scared stiff. Are you scared?

807
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:50,790
lt's too late to be scared.

808
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:06,030
Michel Poiccard: arrest imminent.

809
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:18,150
l've just gotta find Antonio.

810
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:21,710
Once you look for someone,
you never find him.

811
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:28,150
Who was that?

812
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:30,950
- Step on it, poppet.
- What's ''poppet''?

813
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:51,910
Seen Antonio?

814
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:54,910
l'll tell you if l can kiss her.

815
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:57,590
lt's not up to me,

816
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:59,350
it's up to her.

817
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:05,430
He's with Zumbart.

818
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:09,270
Carl!

819
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:16,830
- How's things?
- Antonio's not with you?

820
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,790
There he is.

821
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:22,710
Who is he?

822
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:24,190
- Antonio?
- No, the other one.

823
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:30,550
Let's see those socks.

824
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:33,030
Silk socks with a tweed jacket!

825
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:35,350
- l like silk.
- Not with tweed!

826
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:39,390
- Hi, amigo.
- Hi, sonny.

827
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:41,550
l'll be off.

828
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:44,990
You've been looking for me?

829
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:46,350
Yeah, l'm in the shit.

830
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:51,110
Got a minute?

831
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:52,910
- lt's that man.
- What do l say?

832
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:54,550
Anything you want.

833
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:56,830
l'll just be a sec.

834
01:13:56,830 --> 01:14:00,710
- What will they do?
- Take photos of her kissing the man.

835
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:04,310
- What for?
- Blackmail, probably.

836
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:24,630
Be right back.

837
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:27,230
Who's the chick?

838
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:30,630
- The thing is, l'm in love with her.
- Damn!

839
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:52,590
1 .3 million, can do.

840
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:55,190
- What's your bank?
- The B.N.C.l.

841
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:56,550
Let's see.

842
01:14:59,510 --> 01:15:02,550
- What do we do?
- Dunno.

843
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:05,510
- Where can l reach you tomorrow?
- Dunno.

844
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:08,270
The hotels are crawling with tourists.

845
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:11,150
My friend in Montmartre has a big flat.

846
01:15:11,150 --> 01:15:14,270
- Not Montmartre.
- No, not Montmartre.

847
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:16,030
Why not?

848
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:18,830
Too many enemies in Montmartre.

849
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:20,870
Try Zumbart's Swedish girl.

850
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:23,830
Rue Campagne Premiere?

851
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:25,790
Call me there tomorrow.

852
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:45,350
Antonio said
we could stay the night.

853
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:48,830
Sure. Sit down.
l'll be right with you.

854
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:55,710
Smile!

855
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:01,070
You could pose. lt pays good.

856
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:03,710
You have to sleep around.

857
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:06,670
- l was just thinking...
- What?

858
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:08,590
l can't decide...

859
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:10,430
Decide what?

860
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:15,150
l don't know.
Otherwise l wouldn't hesitate...

861
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:23,870
You dumped your journalist?

862
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:25,510
Why did you say hello?

863
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:28,110
To make sure l didn't love him any more.

864
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:30,990
You make life difficult.

865
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:34,390
That's it. Drop me
on the Champs Elysees?

866
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:51,590
What record?

867
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:56,270
Mozart's clarinet concerto.
Do you mind?

868
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:57,910
No, l like that one.

869
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:00,830
l thought you didn't like music.

870
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:05,310
This one's OK.
My dad was a clarinettist.

871
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:08,550
My dad was a brilliant clarinet-player.

872
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:10,710
Want to turn in?

873
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,910
Sleeping's so sad.

874
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:14,590
We have to separ.

875
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:18,390
- ...ate.
- ''Separ-ate''.

876
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:22,230
They say ''sleep together'',
but it's not true.

877
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:35,590
What is it?

878
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:40,870
Nothing.

879
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:46,870
Come here.

880
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:59,270
Go buy France Soir
and a bottle of milk.

881
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:07,630
What time is it?

882
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:08,990
Five.

883
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:16,390
Engaged all the time.

884
01:18:23,710 --> 01:18:25,870
- What?
- Nothing.

885
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:27,590
France Soir!

886
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:29,710
l'm looking at you.

887
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:37,150
lt's your lucky day. Take a ticket.

888
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:38,990
- A whisky.
- Don't have any.

889
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:41,070
Make it coffee.

890
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:48,950
Danton 01 .00?

891
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:52,390
lnspector Vital, please.

892
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:02,190
Patricia Franchini.

893
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:06,830
l've just seen the fellow
you're looking for.

894
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:11,630
He's at 1 1 , rue Premiere Campagne.

895
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:14,830
Yes. 1 1 , rue Campagne Premiere.

896
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:10,390
Thirsty?

897
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:13,750
Antonio's coming by. He just called.

898
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:17,110
We're on our way to ltaly, girlie!

899
01:20:18,670 --> 01:20:22,510
- l can't go.
- Sure you can, l'm taking you.

900
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:25,710
Berruti's lending me his Simca.

901
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:27,790
An Amedeo Gordini lodel.

902
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:31,150
Michel, l called the police.

903
01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:35,590
- l said you were here.
- Are you crazy?

904
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:38,350
No, l'm fine.

905
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:41,710
No, l'm not.

906
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:45,030
l don't want to go with you.

907
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:47,230
l knew it.

908
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:48,430
l don't know.

909
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:51,670
l just talked about myself,
and you, yourself.

910
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:53,190
l'm so stupid.

911
01:20:53,190 --> 01:20:56,950
You should've talked about me,
and me, about you.

912
01:20:56,950 --> 01:21:00,510
l don't want to be in love with you.

913
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:05,310
That's why l called the police.

914
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:10,590
l stayed with you
to see if l was in love with you.

915
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:13,430
Or if l wasn't.

916
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:18,710
And since l'm being cruel to you,

917
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:21,590
it proves l'm not in love with you.

918
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:23,710
Say that again!

919
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:27,390
And since l'm being cruel to you,

920
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:32,030
it proves l'm not in love with you.

921
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:35,070
They say there's no happy love.

922
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:38,150
lf l loved you...

923
01:21:38,150 --> 01:21:40,030
lt's too complicated!

924
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:44,510
On the contrary,
there's no unhappy love.

925
01:21:44,510 --> 01:21:47,950
l want people to let me be.

926
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:49,630
l'm independent.

927
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:53,990
- Maybe you love me.
- You think you are. You're not.

928
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:55,990
That's why l gave you away.

929
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:58,990
l'm better than you are.

930
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:02,430
Now you have no choice but to go.

931
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:05,470
You're nuts!

932
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:10,030
That's a rotten way to reason!

933
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:20,310
You're like those women
who sleep with everyone...

934
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:24,790
except the one man who loves them...

935
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:28,550
saying it's because they sleep
with everyone.

936
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:32,950
Why don't you go?

937
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:39,590
l've slept with lots of men.
Don't count on me.

938
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:43,070
What are you waiting for?

939
01:22:43,070 --> 01:22:45,670
No, l'm staying. l'm in bad shape.

940
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:48,230
l prefer jail.

941
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:49,990
You're mad!

942
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:56,950
Nobody'll talk to me.

943
01:22:56,950 --> 01:22:59,830
l can look at the walls.

944
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:01,190
Damn, Berruti!

945
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:05,590
Hey, amigo! l'll just park.

946
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:10,630
- Cops are coming.
- Your money!

947
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:13,070
The American gave me away.

948
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:14,790
- Get in!
- No, you go!

949
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:18,910
- Get in!
- No, l'm staying.

950
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:23,430
l've had enough.

951
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:24,990
l'm tired.

952
01:23:24,990 --> 01:23:26,550
l want to sleep.

953
01:23:26,550 --> 01:23:28,030
You're nuts!

954
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:31,710
Damn the police. l'll save my neck.

955
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:36,430
l shouldn't be thinking of her
but l can't help it.

956
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:39,310
Want my automatic?

957
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:43,470
- Don't be stupid!
- Get lost!

958
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:44,150
You're a real louse.

959
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:57,390
What did he say?

960
01:25:57,390 --> 01:26:00,990
He said you're a real louse.

961
01:26:05,270 --> 84:31:37,780
What's a ''louse''?
