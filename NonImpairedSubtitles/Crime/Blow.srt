1
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,336
That's a nice boy.

2
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,371
Go get 'em, Dulli.

3
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,097
Get in there.

4
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,617
We good?

5
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,289
Oh, yeah. Are we good?
We're beautiful.

6
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,217
We're perfect.

7
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,219
This is grade-A, 100% pure Colombian
cocaine, ladies and gentlemen.

8
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,137
Disco shit.

9
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,535
Pure as the driven snow.

10
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,457
<i>My name is George Jung...</i>

11
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,493
<i>federal inmate number 19225004.</i>

12
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,337
<i>I was born in New England.</i>

13
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,416
<i>Massachusetts, actually,</i>
<i>in a town called Weymouth.</i>

14
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,451
<i>That's me.</i>

15
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,935
- Come on! Yeah!
- <i>And that's my best friend Tuna.</i>

16
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,813
<i>My dad ran a plumbing</i>
<i>and heating company.</i>

17
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,569
<i>He had three trucks, ten employees,</i>
<i>and did big jobs.</i>

18
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,214
- Hey! Did you do it?
- <i>He was my hero.</i>

19
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,093
-Yeah, it was great. I didn't fall once.
-Attaboy. See you tonight.

20
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,610
- Can I come to work with you?
- Let's go. Say good-bye to the kid.

21
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,493
Clam it, Bill. I'll talk
to my boy as long as I want to.

22
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,576
You got a problem with that?

23
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,536
Do you really want to come?

24
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,611
Oh, what the heck. All right.

25
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,534
- All right. Get your boots.
- Thanks, Dad, thanks!

26
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,457
Bill, what's your problem?

27
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,378
Guess who's on cleanup today,
and buying lunch.

28
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,889
Money. M-O-N-E-Y.
That's your job--

29
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,773
<i>Dad was a hard worker, but he didn't</i>
<i>make enough money to keep Mom happy.</i>

30
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,653
Why do you think I married you?

31
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,133
<i>She thought she'd married</i>
<i>above her class...</i>

32
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,137
<i>and he promised her the moon</i>
<i>but didn't deliver.</i>

33
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,731
<i>The truth was, business got slow</i>
<i>and we were broke.</i>

34
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,135
Don't touch me! Look at your hands!
You're disgusting!

35
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,696
- Not in front of the boy.
- The boy, the boy. What about me, Fred?

36
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,617
- Mom, wait! Where are you going?
- Go home, George!

37
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,537
Mom, where are you going?

38
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,413
<i>No matter how many times</i>
<i>my mother would leave...</i>

39
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,213
<i>no matter how many times</i>
<i>she embarrassed him...</i>

40
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,854
<i>he always took her back.</i>

41
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,971
<i>He loved her.</i>

42
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,852
<i>God, he loved her.</i>

43
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,777
Ermine.

44
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,209
Come here.

45
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,979
- Are you okay? Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

46
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,817
Hiya, George.

47
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,737
I'm home.

48
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,816
Come on, give me a hug.

49
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,337
Come on, Georgie.

50
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,257
Come to Mommy.

51
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,978
George.

52
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,375
Come give your mother a hug.

53
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:33,297
<i>For ten years, my father worked his ass</i>
<i>off 14 hours a day, 7 days a week.</i>

54
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,173
<i>He didn't care</i>
<i>as long as we were happy.</i>

55
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,734
Okay, what do I have to do?

56
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,658
<i>But in the end,</i>
<i>he didn't make enough.</i>

57
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,011
<i>Slowly but surely,</i>
<i>he lost everything.</i>

58
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,415
<i>We were bankrupt.</i>

59
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,249
-Let's get some ice cream.
-I don't care about ice cream right now.

60
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,177
What are we gonna do?

61
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,097
It'll be all right, George.

62
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,017
It'll work out.
It always does.

63
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,937
I'm gonna find another job.

64
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,574
Look, George,
this is the way it goes.

65
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,975
Sometimes you're flush,
and sometimes you're bust.

66
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,375
When you're up,
it's never as good as it seems...

67
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,253
and when you're down, you never think
you're gonna be up again.

68
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,133
But life goes on.
Remember that.

69
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,251
Money isn't real, George.

70
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,133
It doesn't matter.
It only seems like it does.

71
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,216
You gonna tell that to Mom?

72
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,376
Yeah, that's gonna be
a tricky one.

73
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,257
- Hey, Dad.
- What?

74
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,611
Are we gonna be poor?
'Cause I don't ever want to be poor.

75
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,571
Then you won't.

76
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,450
<i>I decided right then and there</i>
<i>I wasn't gonna live like that.</i>

77
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,333
<i>I needed to get</i>
<i>as far away as possible.</i>

78
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,411
<i>I moved to California</i>
<i>in the summer of 1968...</i>

79
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,337
<i>with the Tuna.</i>

80
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,213
<i>We had $300 and a black TR-3.</i>

81
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,615
<i>Sure was nothing like this back home.</i>

82
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,015
<i>It was paradise.</i>

83
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,337
<i>We got a small, one-bedroom</i>
<i>apartment right on the beach.</i>

84
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,213
<i>It wasn't much,</i>
<i>but it had its perks.</i>

85
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,977
George.

86
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,297
You need some help?

87
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,533
<i>California was like nothing</i>
<i>I'd ever seen before.</i>

88
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,457
Hey, where's the beer?

89
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,253
<i>People were liberated,</i>
<i>independent, full of new ideas.</i>

90
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,699
Hi. This is Tuna.

91
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,608
<i>They used words like</i>
<i>"right on",  "groovy",  "solid".</i>

92
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,537
<i>The women were beautiful...</i>

93
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,137
<i>and they all seemed to share</i>
<i>the same occupation.</i>

94
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,457
- I'm a stewardess.
- I'm a stewardess.

95
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,094
Yeah. On the airplane.

96
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,415
<i>And everyone was getting stoned.</i>

97
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,577
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi.

98
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,611
- Hello.
- Hey, Tuna.

99
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,457
Oh, my God.

100
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,457
I figured it out.

101
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,377
Figured out what?

102
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,775
You know how we were wonderin'
what we were gonna do for money...

103
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,175
bein' as we don't wanna
get jobs and whatnot?

104
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,097
- Yeah.
- Check this out.

105
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,617
Oregano?

106
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,493
- Tuna, this is crap.
- Look, we're selling it.

107
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,373
We're gonna make up three-finger lids
and sell 'em on the beach.

108
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,253
If we move all that, we got,
like, like, a hundred bucks.

109
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,769
And if we don't,
we can smoke it.

110
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,209
- You got ripped off.
- It's not a bad idea.

111
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,251
I-I got the Baggies
and everything.

112
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,975
Look, if you really want to score
some dope, I got the guy.

113

<i>"The guy" was Derek Foreal,</i>

Very nice, Heather.

Now, what can I do
for you guys?

138
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,449
We'd like to buy some pot.

139

I know what you want.

140
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,937
But first, are you cops?

141
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,857
No.

142
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,733
If you are, you have to tell me.
If not, it's entrapment.

143

We're not cops.
We're from Massachusetts.

144

Does he look like a cop?

145
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,616
Actually, no.

146
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,411
You know, it's a good thing
you're friends of Barbie's...

I would never talk to you.

149

What the fuck is that?

150
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,456
It's your pot.

151
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,377
Wow.

152
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,456
That's more than we had in mind.

I don't nickel-and-dime.
Do you want it or not?

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,691
<i>The bills were paid, and I was making</i>
<i>more money than I could at a real job.</i>

158
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,970
<i>I built a reputation for myself.</i>

159
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,298
<i>People even started calling me</i>
<i>Boston George.</i>

160
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,217
<i>It was perfect.</i>

161
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,295
This is it for me.

162
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,536
What is it?

163
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,457
Everything.

164
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,333
You, California, the beach...

165
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,257
this spot right here.

166
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,053
Just finally feel like
I belong somewhere, you know.

167
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,977
I feel right.

168
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,735
You're happy.

169
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,657
Yeah, I am.

170
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,498
You?

171
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,097
Good.

172
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,739
Look what the cat dragged in.

173
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,657
Holy shit. Dulli!

174
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,333
- Man.
- What the fuck are you doing out here?

175
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,258
Man, I'll tell ya. I was walking
down the beach, minding my business.

176
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,292
Who do I see? This fuckin' guy.

177
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,173
I didn't know you guys
were living out in California.

178
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,256
- Yeah. What are you doing out here?
- I'm on vacation, man.

179
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,177
I'm on my way back to school.

180
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,178
Oh. Well, this calls for a joint.
You wanna do the honors?

181
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,416
No, man. I'm too fucked up.

182
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,337
That's nice weed, huh?

183
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,009
Fuck, yeah. I've never seen anything
like this. I'm fuckin' wasted.

184
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,574
Right on.

185
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,497
Man.

186
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,776
I'm fuckin' stoned.

187
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,209
I'm fuckin' stoned.

188
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,855
I'm really stoned.

189
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,096
I'm fuckin' stoned, man.
I'm really--

190
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,858
Stoned?

191
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,174
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

192
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,690
Man, I wish there was
stuff like this back at home.

193
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,936
- Yeah?
- Fuck, yeah!

194
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,938
You know how much money I could make
with this stuff back east?

195
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,176
- Yeah?
- No shit, Kev?

196
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,858
- That's right.
- Yeah?

197
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,733
When there's stuff to move,
it's too easy not to.

198
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,613
Do you know how many colleges
there are within a 60-mile radius?

199
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,971
- U. Mass, Amherst, B.U.
- Smith, Hampshire.

200
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,375
- Right. And Holyoke.
- Holyoke.

201
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,253
There's 100,000 rich kids
with their parents' money to spend...

202
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,133
and there's never anything around--
nothin' good, anyways.

203
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,535
I'm spendin' 400 bucks on shit.

204
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,855
Yeah?

205
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,017
The way I figure it...

206
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,859
Barbara flies back east
twice a week...

207
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,211
two bags per flight,
25 pounds in each bag.

208
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,296
That's a hundred pounds a week.

209
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,651
I know it's a lot of weight, but you
can't get pot like this back home.

210
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,497
I'm telling you, Derek, it'll sell.

211
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,736
I don't know.

212
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,569
The best part--
we can charge 500 a pound.

213
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,453
Come on, George.
No one's gonna pay that.

214
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,377
It's already been negotiated.
It's done.

215
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,297
The money's there waitin'.

216
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,217
Goodness.

217
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,410
Goodness is right.

218
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,337
Listen.

219
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,174
I want you to be my partner
on this thing, Derek, 50-50.

220
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,770
If you do the math, that's
over 30 grand a week profit.

221
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,653
That's $ 15,000 a week
for you, my friend...

222
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,852
in your pocket, free and clear.

223
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,777
And I just deal with you?

224
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,175
Barbara and me. No one else.

225
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,416
It's gonna work, Derek.

226
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,491
I don't know. East coast, airplanes.

227
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,815
I'm paranoid. It seems really risky.

228
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,578
Derek, she's a stewardess.

229
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,497
They don't check her bags.

230
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,294
Bye.

231
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,337
- Hey, Barbara!
- Kevin.

232
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,696
See this suit? Gabardine.

233
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,497
- See you.
- Okay. Bye.

234
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,417
- Barbara!
- Kevin.

235
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,452
More. I need more.

236
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,297
- Hey, Kevin.
- I need more.

237
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,492
- I need more.
- What do you want me to do?

238
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,373
I can only carry two bags,
and I can't fly back here every day.

239
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,253
I know, but I got
a feeding frenzy on my hands.

240
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,611
This is small potatoes.
We're missing out on some serious cash.

241
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,538
- Tell George. He'll think of something.
- I will.

242
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,731
- Ladies and gentlemen, Kevin Dulli!
- We made it!

243
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,091
20, 40, 60, 80, nine.
20, 40, 60, 80, one thousand.

244
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,575
A hundred and twenty-eight
thousand dollars.

245
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,453
Jesus Christ, I'm gettin' a boner
just lookin' at it.

246
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,377
Do you believe it, George?

247
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,173
What's the matter, George?
Is something wrong?

248
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,053
Cheer up. Half of this is ours.
We're fuckin' rich.

249
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,097
- It's not enough.
- What?

250
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,690
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- The setup is wrong.

251
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,778
We're doing all the legwork,
and we're still paying retail.

252
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,856
- We're gettin' fuckin' middled.
- So?

253
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,096
So we need to get to the source.

254
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,973
- The source? What about Derek?
- He's gettin' middled too.

255
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,809
Derek's our partner.
What's good for him is good for us.

256
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,737
So we need a source.

257
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,657
Where do we start?

258
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,253
Either one of you guys
speak Spanish?

259
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,335
Tuna! Get the fuck in here!

260
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,257
Go on, play.

261
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,497
<i>Salut,</i> then. <i>Salut?</i>

262
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,656
- <i>Salud.</i>
- <i>Salud.</i> Cheers.

263
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,898
- Smokee?
- Smoke-um?

264
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,976
Do you have some pot?

265
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,853
<i>¿Donde esta</i> pot?

266
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,574
- Do you know where we can get some pot?
- No. No.

267
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,260
<i>El-- El</i> weed.

268
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,178
Do you know where
we can find some marijuana?

269
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,656
Take a little off the top.

270
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,577
Marijuana? Smoke--

271
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,615
- So, you got anything?
- I haven't asked yet.

272
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,334
- What?
- I didn't ask yet. Go ahead.

273
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,817
Come on, are we--

274
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,497
I'll be back.

275
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,497
Santiago.

276
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,653
Ramon tells me you're
looking for some <i>mota.</i>

277
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,577
Yeah, I am.

278
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,731
For instance, uh,
something like this, eh?

279
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,738
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that'll do it.

280
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,657
I'll take it.

281
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,252
You're funny. Really.

282
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,133
How much will you be needing?

283
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,057
All of it.

284
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,933
Yeah, I'll come back
in a week with a plane.

285
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:32,373
<i>Mi madre. Oye, Americano,</i>
maybe we're going too fast.

286
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,049
You take a little,
and then come back.

287
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,933
Yeah, but I don't need a little.
I need a lot.

288
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,498
Hang on a minute. Listen.

289
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,373
Senor. Tell you what, amigo.

290
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,536
What about I come back...

291
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,491
and I bring you, say...

292
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,417
$50,000?

293
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,974
That alleviate
some of your concerns?

294
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,456
Amigo, you bring me $50,000...

295
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,048
and I have no more concerns.

296
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,255
I can't believe
we're stealing a plane.

297
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,770
Don't be such a pussy. We're not
fuckin' stealing it, we're borrowing it.

298
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,892
Be cool, boys.
Got a little company here.

299
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,777
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

300
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,653
Tuna, let's go. Tuna.

301
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,011
- Good luck. I'll see you in the desert.
- Right.

302
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,893
- You sure you know what you're doing?
- George, relax, all right?

303
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,773
I've flown with my old man
a million times.

304
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,131
It's not the taking-off part
you gotta worry about, it's the landing.

305
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,612
Good to see you.
You're a man of your word.

306
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,538
Listen, you know
the 50,000 I promised you?

307
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,617
Couldn't get it.

308
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,935
So I brought you 7 5 instead.

309
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,577
Go!

310
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,936
Merry Christmas, Derek.

311
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,857
Merry Christmas!

312
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,808
It's beautiful.

313
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,735
You're a genius, George.

314
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,090
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

315
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,178
This would make
a fabulous Christmas card.

316
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,097
Get my camera, Sven.

317
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,813
George! Did you see the bedroom?

318
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,693
I love it! It's so pretty!

319
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,095
- Did you see it?
- Yeah, I saw it.

320
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,017
- Hi. My God!
- Hi.

321
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,937
- What do you think?
- Are you kidding?

322
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,857
- Yeah? You want it?
- Mm-hmm.

323
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,289
We'll take it.

324
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,093
Cannonball!

325
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,255
<i>It was a great time in our lives.</i>

326
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,052
<i>The seven of us</i>
<i>were like a family.</i>

327
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,775
<i>We worked hard, we played hard,</i>
<i>didn't have a care in the world.</i>

328
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,015
<i>It was perfect.</i>

329
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,697
I can't get over the size of that ring.
I just love it.

330
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,573
Look at it, Fred.
Tell me you don't love that ring.

331
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,931
I'm just happy that George here
has found somebody he cares for.

332
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,291
Yes, of course, but I'm talkin'
about the ring. It's somethin' else.

333
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,490
- George has exquisite taste.
- What is it, two carats?

334
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,373
- It's gotta be at least two carats.
- I don't know.

335
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,253
Yes, it's definitely two carats.
Treasure it, darling.

336
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,133
- You might wanna get that insured.
- Okay, Mom.

337
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,809
Hard to imagine being able to afford a
ring like that on a construction salary.

338
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,970
Oh, shut your big, fat mouth.

339
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,853
You don't buy it all at once.
It's called layaway.

340
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,653
- Layaway, schmayaway--
- Yes, layaway.

341
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,657
Something you wouldn't know
anything about, you cheapskate.

342
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,248
- Cheapskate, beapskate.
- Yeah, you, you big tightwad.

343
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,211
He still has his communion money.

344
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,774
- Don't listen to her. Yap, yap, yap.
- George, tell your father--

345
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,656
George, you tell your father
about layaway.

346
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,975
Layaway.

347
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,933
The boy's happy, Fred.
Don't be such a killjoy.

348
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,415
- I'm not a killjoy.
- Oh,Jesus, babe.

349
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,259
Put your head up.
Put your head back.

350
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,338
My, Barbara.
Here, take my napkin.

351
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,179
- I'll be okay.
- I'll get you some ice.

352
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,768
- Irene, we need some ice.
- Yeah, she's all right.

353
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,653
- You wanna go?
- Yeah, let's go.

354
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,374
- Come on. You haven't had your entree.
- No, it's okay.

355
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,297
I'm gonna leave the tip.

356
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,332
I hope you're feeling better.
It was lovely to meet you.

357
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,497
George, give your mother
a call in the morning.

358
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,177
What a lovely girl.

359
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,097
Is that all hundreds?

360
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,017
Yeah.

361
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,813
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

362
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,171
Honey, would you be bummed out
if I didn't go to Chicago with you?

363
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,575
No, not if you don't wanna.

364
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,655
Listen, I gotta apologize
about my parents. That was--

365
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,897
They weren't that bad.
They were kinda cute.

366
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,817
I'm not sure about that.

367
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,495
I want you to promise me something.

368
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,851
I want you to promise me
that we're never gonna be like that.

369
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,733
I don't wanna wind up like them.

370
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,816
We're gonna wind up like us.

371
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,817
Yeah?

372
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,295
- I love you.
- Get in the car.

373
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,980
Hurry, before they come out.

374
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,375
<i>GeorgeJung, you stand accused...</i>

375
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,776
<i>of possession of</i>
<i>660 pounds of marijuana...</i>

376
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,697
<i>with intent to distribute.</i>

377
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,651
<i>How do you plead?</i>

378
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,817
Your Honor, I'd like to say
a few words to the court, if I may.

379
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,171
You're going to have to stop slouching
and stand up to address this court, sir.

380
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,097
All right, fine.

381
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,656
Well, in all honesty...

382
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,533
I don't feel that
what I've done is a crime...

383
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,891
and it's illogical and irresponsible
for you to sentence me to prison.

384
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,773
Because, when you think about it,
what did I really do?

385
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,653
I crossed an imaginary line
with a bunch of plants.

386
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,533
I mean, you say I'm an outlaw,
you say I'm a thief...

387
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,811
but where's the Christmas dinner
for the people on relief, huh?

388
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,693
You say you're looking for someone
who's never weak but always strong...

389
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,573
to gather flowers constantly,
whether you were right or wrong...

390
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,533
someone to open each and every door,
but it ain't me, babe.

391
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,255
No, no, it ain't me, babe.
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.

392
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,416
- You follow ?
- Yeah.

393
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,173
Gosh, you know, your concepts
are really interesting, Mr.Jung.

394
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,131
Thank you.

395
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,933
Unfortunately for you,
the line you crossed was real...

396
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,813
and the plants you brought
with you were illegal.

397
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,090
So your bail is $20,000.

398
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,017
- I--
- Next case, Your Honor.

399
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,971
Number 14173.

400
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,297
- George.
- Hey, babe.

401
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,530
What are you doing here?

402
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,457
Surprise.

403
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,333
You didn't have to come
all the way out here, babe.

404
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,338
What, and miss all the fun?
Not a chance.

405
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,257
So...

406
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,336
what's the verdict?

407
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,656
The lawyer says he can plead it
down to five years.

408
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,577
I'll serve two.

409
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,009
- Two years?
- Yeah.

410
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,937
Two years.

411
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,255
George, I can't wait that long.

412
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,769
Are you kiddin'? You're not gonna wait
for me? What the fuck is that?

413
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,057
I don't have two years.

414
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,377
What?

415
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,059
<i>Losing Barbara to cancer</i>
<i>changed everything.</i>

416
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,614
<i>The old gang broke up.</i>

417
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,971
<i>Tuna stayed in Mexico.</i>
<i>God only knows what happened to him.</i>

418
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,331
<i>The point is, we all lost touch.</i>

419
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,372
<i>I'd skipped bail in Chicago</i>
<i>to take care of Barbara...</i>

420
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,139
<i>and was now a fugitive on the run.</i>

421
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,651
<i>It'd been almost a year</i>
<i>since I'd seen my parents...</i>

422
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,577
<i>and believe it or not...</i>

423
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,611
<i>I actually missed them.</i>

424
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,890
Hi, Mom.

425
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,577
Surprised to see me?

426
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,936
Take off your boots.

427
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,017
You're tan.

428
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,937
Mexico.

429
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,494
Yeah. I heard about it.

430
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,217
I want you to know I'm--

431
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,616
I'm deeply sorry
about your girlfriend.

432
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,216
- Barbara.
- Yeah, Barbara.

433
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,137
Nice girl.

434
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,177
Thank you.

435
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,013
You been getting the money
I send you?

436
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,370
What, you mean the drug money?

437
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,297
Yeah, I got it.

438
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,656
Oh, God.

439
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,497
What are you doing?

440
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,417
What are you doing, baby?

441
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,337
It's okay, Mom.

442
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,576
- George?
- It's okay.

443
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,168
- Georgie!
- Hi, Pop.

444
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,734
I thought I heard somethin'.
How are ya?

445
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,454
- Good.
- Ah, son, come on in.

446
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,696
Oh, yeah. You look good.

447
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,933
<i>May the wind always</i>
<i>be at your back...</i>

448
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,812
and the sun upon your face.

449
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,215
And may the winds of destiny
carry you aloft...

450
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,137
to dance with the stars.

451
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,251
- Cheers, Georgie.
- Cheers, Pop.

452
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,377
Are you all right?

453
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,815
Just low, you know.

454
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,737
You really loved her.

455
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,537
Yeah, Dad.

456
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,457
I really did.

457
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,451
Are you mad at me?

458
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,417
- Yeah, you are.
- No.

459
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,771
-I can tell by how you're looking at me.
-I'm not mad, George.

460
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,335
I just don't understand
what you're doing.

461
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,212
I don't understand your choices.

462
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,093
The goddamn cops
are looking for you.

463
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,017
I know.

464
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,733
I'm great at what I do, Dad.

465
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,613
I mean, I'm really great
at what I do.

466
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,416
Let me tell you somethin', George.

467
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,771
You would've been great at anything.

468
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,697
Anything.

469
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,339
Goddamn!

470
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,211
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em! Fuck!

471
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,017
I had no choice.

472
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,855
Don't look at me like that.

473
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,459
Let's go.

474
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,253
- What was I supposed to do?
-Jesus Christ, Ermine.

475
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,177
- He was in our house!
- Shut up!

476
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,053
What, was I supposed to be
an accomplice?

477
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,331
You don't think people know
you're a drug dealer?

478
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,930
Everyone knows you're a drug dealer.
It's no secret.

479
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,813
How do you think
that reflects on me?

480
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,454
Every time I go out,
I'm humiliated.

481
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,539
So you go to jail.
It's for your own good!

482
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,413
You need to straighten
your life out!

483
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,050
What are you looking at, Mrs. Gracie?
Your son's no prize.

484
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,937
Stop.

485
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,857
Open up cell number three!

486
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,457
The prisoner is in!

487
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,732
Close cell number three.

488
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,498
Hello. My name is Diego Delgado.
How do you do?

489
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,417
- Hey, George.
- What?

490
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,656
If you don't mind me asking...

491
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,533
what is the reason
you are in this place?

492
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,374
I don't want to talk about it.

493
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,297
Oh, come on, George.

494
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,491
If we are to be friends,
we must trust each other.

495
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,215
- I don't like a lot of conversation.
- Me too.

496
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,012
Too much blah-blah-blah.

497
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,017
But we are roommates.

498
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,937
We must talk to each other.

499
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,094
I'm arrested for stealing cars...

500
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,254
for the grand theft auto.

501
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,897
Murder.

502
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,017
Murder.

503
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,615
What do you got down there, Diego?

504
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,613
Nothing.Just a little project.

505
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,737
What kind of little project?

506
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,177
Never mind.

507
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,097
Not for you to worry.

508
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,171
Come on, I thought you said
we're supposed to be roommates...

509
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,053
tell each other everything,
all that kind of shit.

510
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,853
You have your intrigues,
I have mine.

511
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,253
Today is a happy day
for me, George.

512
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:37,089
Nine months from today,
I'll be in Medellin sipping champagne.

513
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,496
In nine months, I'm free.

514
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,217
I'm happy for you.

515
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,217
Yeah.

516
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,171
How much time do you have?

517
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,256
Oh, let's see.

518
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,217
Twenty-six months.

519
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,695
Twenty-six months?

520
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,617
For murder.

521
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,771
I must meet your lawyer.

522
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,451
I gotta get out of here, Diego.

523
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,773
Only two ways I know
to leave here early.

524
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,614
One is to escape.

525
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,057
Okay, what's the other?

526
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,731
Uh, all right, I guess
we oughta open our books.

527
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,010
Man, fuck you!

528
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,937
- We ain't openin' shit.
- That's right.

529
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,813
You're just the warden's little bitch.
We're hip to you.

530
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,453
Doin' this shit
to get some time cut off.

531
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,650
What the fuck. Why not?

532
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,852
I want to get out of this shit-hole
as quickly as fuckin' possible.

533
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,096
But for me to walk early...

534
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,017
some of you has gotta graduate.

535
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,257
You should forget it.
You're hopeless. Go to sleep.

536
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,133
- Fuck you. See ya in the shower.
-Jive-ass turkey.

537
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,332
The rest of you might be able
to get diplomas and get jobs...

538
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,257
when you get back on the outside.

539
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,769
Shit, I'm in this bitch for life.

540
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,858
I'm a criminal.
Ain't nobody givin' me no fuckin' job.

541
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,255
Well...

542
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,133
then let's learn
some criminal shit too.

543
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,615
Tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.

544
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,369
About half the time, I teach you
about this George Washington character.

545
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,379
The other half, I teach youse
how to smuggle drugs.

546
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,412
You don't know dick
about smugglin' no drugs.

547
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,337
Oh, no?

548
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,611
I was arrested in Chicago
with 660 pounds of grass.

549
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,537
I think that qualifies me.

550
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,413
How the fuck you get
660 pounds of weed?

551
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,771
Flew it in from Mexico
on a single-engine Cessna.

552
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,175
So, we got a deal or what?

553
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,537
What?

554
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,369
I listened to what you said
to the class today about the smuggling.

555
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,253
Never believed
you were a murderer.

556
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,735
I knew you were a <i>magico.</i>

557
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,772
I'm tired, Diego. Go to bed.

558
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,939
Do you know, in my country
I'm a <i>magico...</i>

559
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,857
a man with a dream...

560
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,777
a man on the rise...

561
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,778
to take nothing
and make it something.

562
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,657
Do you have a dream, George?

563
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,453
Well, I would if I could
get some fucking sleep.

564
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,491
You have a dream.

565
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,932
And maybe you will accomplish it.

566
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,769
But yet you failed. Why?

567
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,812
- Because I got caught.
- No, <i>manito.</i>

568
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,056
You failed...

569
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:38,092
because you had the wrong dream.

570
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,135
What do you know about cocaine?

571
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:54,092
First of all, what type
of planes do you have?

572
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,099
They're four-passenger,
single-engine Cessnas.

573
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,017
Four passengers.

574
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,256
So that means--

575
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,770
How many kilos
we can fit on those planes?

576
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,175
I don't know. Probably 100, 150.

577
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,256
<i>Danbury wasn't a prison...</i>

578
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,177
<i>it was a crime school.</i>

579
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,133
<i>I went in with</i>
<i>a Bachelor of Marijuana.</i>

580
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,013
<i>Came out with</i>
<i>a doctorate of cocaine.</i>

581
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,256
<i>And after 16 months...</i>

582
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,655
<i>I was once again a free man.</i>

583
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,055
<i>Well, not altogether free.</i>

584
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,933
<i>The conditions of my parole were that</i>
<i>I had to live at my parents'house...</i>

585
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,857
<i>and find a job.</i>

586
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,777
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Diego Delgado, please.

587
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,095
<i>Boston George. Today is the day.</i>

588
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,017
- <i>Are you out?</i>
- Yeah, I'm out.

589
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,893
<i>Congratulations, my brother.</i>
<i>I've been waiting for you.</i>

590
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,817
- How are we doing?
- <i>Fine.</i>

591
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,693
<i>Everything is perfect down here.</i>
<i>Everything is all set up.</i>

592
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,573
Do we need a plane? How does this work?
When do I see you?

593
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,931
<i>Slow down. You need to come down here.</i>
<i>Everybody meets everybody.</i>

594
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,857
<i>We do one for good faith...</i>

595
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,777
<i>and then we talk about airplanes.</i>

596
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,175
- I can't go anywhere.
- Georgie! Nice and cold.

597
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,097
All right, Pop.
One-- One minute.

598
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,973
I'm on fuckin' parole.
I can't leave the state.

599
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,331
<i>But, George, you'll be back</i>
<i>before they know you're gone.</i>

600
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,735
I just got released
five minutes ago.

601
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,328
<i>George, are we</i>
<i>gonna do this, or not?</i>

602
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,497
My friend.

603
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,771
- How are you?
- Fine. Good to see you.

604
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,853
Okay, 15 kilos it is then, okay?

605
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,171
We receive $ 100,000 upon delivery.

606
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,370
Not so fast. No, no, no.

607
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,253
I would like to
go over the details.

608
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,297
What details?

609
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,651
I put the coke in the false bottoms,
and I take it through customs.

610
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,577
That's it.

611
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,531
Tell me about the suitcases.

612
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,891
- Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
- What?

613
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,817
Clothes.

614
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,851
In the suitcase.

615
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,732
Yeah, okay.

616
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,575
Okay, yeah, let's try it.
Why not?

617
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,577
Whose clothes? Your clothes?

618
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:18,218
Okay, Diego, what the fuck
is going on here?

619
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,730
You pulled me all the way down here
to talk about fuckin' clothes?

620
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,009
I demand to know everything.

621
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,813
I do not trust $600,000 worth
of coca to someone I don't know.

622
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,852
It's 15 fucking kilos.
I piss 15 kilos.

623
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,290
- Hey, hey, hey! Gentlemen, please. Hey.
- You're an amateur.

624
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,811
There's no need
to be impolite, okay?

625
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,054
George, Cesar
is just being thorough.

626
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,455
And that's all, okay?

627
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,535
Okay, very well.

628
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,457
But just remember, Mr.Jung...

629
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,890
I will be with you the whole way,
and I will be watching.

630
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,853
<i>When you're carrying drugs</i>
<i>across the border...</i>

631
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,255
<i>the idea is to remain calm.</i>

632
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,611
<i>The way I do it is to think</i>
<i>of something pleasant--</i>

633
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,652
<i>a fun party, a moment of triumph...</i>

634
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,577
<i>a sexual encounter.</i>

635
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,453
<i>I actually project myself</i>
<i>to that place.</i>

636
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:45,333
<i>A little Transcendental Meditation,</i>
<i>if you will.</i>

637
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,213
<i>The trick is to imagine</i>
<i>every little detail.</i>

638
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,217
<i>Anything to keep your mind</i>
<i>off the fact...</i>

639
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,171
<i>that you're going to jail</i>
<i>for a very long time...</i>

640
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,053
<i>if they find the 15 kilos</i>
<i>of blow in your suitcase.</i>

641
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,977
Passport, please.

642
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,008
- Nice flight?
- Yeah, it was pretty good. Thanks.

643
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,376
- On vacation?
- Yes.

644
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,333
On vacation for only one day?

645
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,257
Oh, yeah.
My brother's wedding.

646
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,258
It was a nice ceremony and everything.
It was good.

647
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,889
Open your bag, please.

648
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,857
Sure.

649
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,693
- Whose clothes are these?
- Mine.

650
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,697
And these?

651
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:38,613
Old habits, you know.
Hard to break.

652
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,137
Close it up.

653
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,260
<i>The trial period was over.</i>

654
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:07,929
<i>It was time to start moving</i>
<i>some serious weight.</i>

655
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,620
<i>Commercial flights</i>
<i>weren't gonna cut it anymore.</i>

656
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,537
<i>What we needed was a pilot.</i>

657
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,699
I'll fly down on a Friday, refuel
in the Bahamas, and then on to Medellin.

658
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,577
Please continue.

659
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,371
We make the pickup,
refuel once more in the Bahamas...

660
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,537
and then fly back on Sunday
with the mom-and-pop traffic.

661
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,969
Why are you speaking?

662
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,295
- What?
- You.

663
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,537
Your responsibility is over. You're
not a pilot, you're not a distributor.

664
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,732
You simply introduced us to Mr. Stevens
and the use of his plane, that is all.

665
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,897
You make a percentage, and a generous
one, and you're lucky to get that.

666
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,817
I see.

667
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,017
How much?

668
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,849
Padrino will pay $ 10,000 per kilo
for everyone-- you, you and you.

669
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,811
Three million.
That is all.

670
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,330
- There is no negotiation.
- I want two.

671
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,418
A million each
had such a nice ring to it.

672
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,814
No way.

673
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,171
I'm doing all the work, I'm taking
all the risks, and it's my plane.

674
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,097
You guys don't have to do shit.

675
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:17,371
You just sit back
and collect your money.

676
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,253
You good with this?

677
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,177
Yeah.

678
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,694
That's enough. That's enough!

679
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,294
- Do you have pictures of your kids?
- What?

680
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,773
I'll need to see them.

681
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,130
I'll also need their names
and the names of their schools.

682
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:53,013
We are trusting you with millions
of dollars worth of coca, Mr. Stevens.

683
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,893
Without your children,
there is no deal.

684
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,849
Fine.

685
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,217
Mr. Stevens.

686
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,417
Don't forget the pictures.

687
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,811
George, come here!
I need to talk to you!

688
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,617
Yeah! Yeah.

689
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:27,095
George, come here.
What's the matter?

690
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,973
I mean, aside from the fact...

691
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,853
that we're moving 300 fuckin' kilos
and we're making dogshit...

692
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,811
nothing, really.

693
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,977
- A million dollars is not bad.
- It's fuckin' chump change.

694
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,853
We may as well be haulin'
suitcases across the border.

695
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,733
You know, George, this is
a very small part of the business.

696
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,657
Very small.

697
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,692
Which reminds me,
I need a favor from you.

698
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:53,655
<i>The "favor" was to pick up</i>
<i>50 kilos of cocaine.</i>

699
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,498
<i>Fifty.</i>

700
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,417
<i>That's 110 pounds.</i>

701
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,337
<i>Not exactly a small favor.</i>

702
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,213
<i>It's not like bumming</i>
<i>a cigarette, for example.</i>

703
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,093
<i>But what the hell. I didn't have</i>
<i>anything better to do that day.</i>

704
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,053
<i>It's not like I was</i>
<i>on parole or anything.</i>

705
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:12,219
How you doin'? I'm George.
Friend of Diego's.

706
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,577
Where is Diego?

707
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,453
I don't know.
He sent me. I'm George.

708
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,857
Well, that explains everything.

709
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,857
Open your mouth, George.

710
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,777
Get fucked.

711
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,697
Open your fuckin' mouth.

712
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,095
Now, you listen to me.

713
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,017
You hearing me?

714
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,539
Yes.

715
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,254
I've been holding 50 keys
for Diego for three weeks.

716
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,257
Tell him I don't appreciate it.

717
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,531
You tell him I want my money by Friday.
Can you do that?

718
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,378
I think so.

719
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,297
"I think so".

720
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,454
- Hello.
- <i>Hello. May I speak to George, please?</i>

721
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,816
George, you have a phone call.

722
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,896
Okay, Mom.

723
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,817
Thank you.

724
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,737
- Hello.
- <i>Hello? George?</i>

725
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,657
- Diego.
- <i>Hey, how are you?</i>

726
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,577
- How are you?
- <i>I'm fine.</i>

727
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,497
Where are you?

728
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:28,214
<i>Bad news, George.</i>
<i>I'm in Colombia.</i>

729
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,093
Boy, I sure would
like to see you.

730
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,973
And so would some
of your old friends.

731
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:38,298
You know, George, it's a little bit
hard to get away right now.

732
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:41,173
I'm afraid you're on your own.

733
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,575
I'm in jail.

734
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,497
<i>What?</i>

735
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,736
Yeah.

736
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,373
What I'm doing here
is measuring the purity.

737
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,970
Pure coke,
it melts away at about 185...

738
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,897
190 degrees.

739
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:06,457
Cutting agents,
they melt away at about 100.

740
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:11,574
And quality product, well,
that's melting at around 140.

741
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,897
A hundred and thirty. Good.

742
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,773
A hundred and forty.

743
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,697
Yes.

744
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,057
A hundred and fifty.

745
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,691
Fuck me running!
A hundred and sixty?

746
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:30,130
Jesus Christ!
A hundred and seventy!

747
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,172
A hundred and eighty.
A hundred--

748
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,133
A hundred and eighty-seven.

749
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,251
Where did you get this stuff?

750
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,211
Colombia.

751
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:47,729
- Well, do you mind if I do a line?
- Yeah, go ahead.

752
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,657
Fuck it. Let's all do one.

753
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,537
What'd I tell you, Derek?

754
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:11,813
It's great. But what am I
supposed to do with all this?

755
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,693
- Sell it.
-Jesus Christ, George.

756
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:19,894
I don't see you in 2 years, and you show
up at my door with 110 pounds of blow?

757
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,136
Just fucking sell it, Derek.

758
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,809
All right, but it's
gonna take me a year.

759
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,091
I can't feel my face.

760
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,332
I mean, I can touch it,
but I can't feel it inside.

761
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,334
Thirty-six hours.
Thirty-six hours.

762
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,213
I don't believe
we got rid of it in 36 hours.

763
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:47,013
I think it's fair to say you
underestimated the market, Derek.

764
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:50,769
Right on. It's gonna take us longer
to count it than it did to sell it.

765
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,337
Greetings, Mr. George.

766
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,655
<i>Hola, amigos.</i>
Here you go.

767
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:13,659
1.35 million. Anyplace
in particular you'd like to count it?

768
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,657
On the plane.

769
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,089
What fuckin' plane?

770
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,933
Thanks.

771
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:00,530
- What the fuck is goin' on here?
- Good to see you.

772
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,413
- I thought you were in jail.
- Pablo used his influence.

773
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,771
Now, watch what you say, okay?
Everybody hears everything.

774
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,939
A lot of things get said, and then--
Let's just say this isn't America.

775
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,857
- All right.
- Okay? Life is cheap here.

776
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,255
No offense, but you know
what I'm saying.

777
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:18,133
Right, I'll just keep
my fuckin' mouth shut.

778
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:21,969
Now, who's this person in California?
The connection?

779
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,897
It's a friend.

780
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,773
- Who? I need to know.
- It's a friend. A fucking friend, okay?

781
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,175
- Who?
- A friend. I ain't tellin' you no more.

782
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,177
We'll talk about it later.

783
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,976
Look. That's Pablo.

784
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,937
Oh, shit.

785
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,857
El Padrino...

786
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:03,414
<i>was Senor Pablo Escobar.</i>

787
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,771
<i>And for those of you living</i>
<i>on the moon for the last 20 years...</i>

788
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,175
<i>he was it--</i>
<i>the boss of it all.</i>

789
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,097
El Magico.

790
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,457
He will see you now.

791
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,377
- Okay, let's go.
- Not you.

792
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,214
What?

793
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:36,615
- No, you go.
- No. Fuck-- Wait.

794
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,935
It's gonna be fine.

795
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,813
What the fuck?
I'm not going over there alone.

796
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,215
You gotta do all the talking.
Remember?

797
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,049
Senor Escobar only wants to see you.
Not me. You go.

798
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,455
- This way, please.
- Yeah, yeah. Right, right.

799
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,855
Take it easy.
It's gonna be fine.

800
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,377
All right. Fuck it.

801
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,457
So...

802
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,970
you are the man
who takes 50 kilos...

803
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,853
and makes them disappear
in one day?

804
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,255
Actually, it was three days.

805
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,177
<i>El Magico.</i>

806
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,372
Greetings, Mr. George.
Welcome to Colombia.

807
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,937
Oh, this man.

808
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,857
He was full of courage.

809
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,254
Informant?

810
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,131
He would have run, fled the country,
gone to the <i>policia.</i>

811
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:39,414
But then his wife, his children,
his parents, his friends--

812
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,656
Many people would die.

813
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,337
Well, let me take
this opportunity...

814
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,213
to thank you very much for inviting me
to your beautiful country.

815
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,138
Beautiful, yes, but poor.

816
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:59,299
Coffee, bananas-- these are
our main exports, along with <i>mota.</i>

817
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:04,096
We've been overrun by the fucking
<i>comunistas,</i> but that is another story.

818
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:09,051
Our business here today
is cocaine, yes?

819
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,977
<i>Si.</i> Yes, it is.

820
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:14,655
I need to find an <i>americano...</i>

821
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,577
who I can trust...

822
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:20,852
one with honor, intelligence--

823
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,813
You need an <i>americano</i>
with balls, Senor Escobar.

824
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,296
Yes, and balls, Mr. George.

825
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:31,538
Well, look, I can do
several things for you.

826
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,697
I can transport the cocaine
from your ranch here in Colombia...

827
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:37,380
to the United States,
starting with California.

828
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,775
I got pilots,
I got planes standing by.

829
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:44,018
Good, good. But I need more details.
What is the cost?

830
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:47,576
Right off the top of my head--

831
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,817
I'd have to talk to Diego
and everything, but let's just say...

832
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,056
roughly 10,000 per kilo.

833
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:56,217
How much can you transport?

834
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:00,049
Again, this is a language that I would
have to discuss with my partner...

835
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:03,616
but 300 kilos--

836
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,618
So that's $3 million.

837
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:09,379
This I understand, but--

838
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:13,175
- Please, to remove.
- Yeah.

839
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,814
These complications with Diego--

840
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,773
the stolen cars, getting him
released from the <i>carcel--</i>

841
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,936
this causes me much inconvenience.

842
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,255
The 50 kilos could have
been a big problem.

843
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,769
Huh? I don't like problems.

844
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:35,813
With all due respect,
<i>el "Padroni"...</i>

845
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,659
Diego is my partner...

846
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,691
so I won't negotiate without him.

847
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,095
I won't do business without him.

848
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,176
- I just won't.
- You sure?

849
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,131
I'm sure.

850
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,728
Let us speak no more of this business.
Let's go for a drive.

851
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,976
We have many other things
to talk about, yes?

852
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,972
I've made a decision.

853
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,773
We're going into business together,
and I want to start right away.

<i>it came from us.</i>

860
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,456
All right.
Three million I counted it twice.

861
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,730
Two-point-five.
Two-point-five. I'm sure.

862
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:19,249
I'm calling it three.

863
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,496
Then we are half a million off?

864
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:23,975
Well, fuck it.
I'm not counting it again.

865
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,931
Weigh it.

866
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,779
If it's 60 pounds, it's 3 million.
Fifty is two-point-five.

867
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,255
I don't give a shit.
It's close enough.

868
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,177
Where do I put it?

869
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,575
Try the back bedroom.

870
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:43,328
- No room.
- Shit. Try the closet.

871

Huh? He's here meeting everybody.

But still he keeps his secret,
even from his brother, huh?

<i>So do I.</i>

931
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:06,258
<i>We had the world</i>
<i>by the short and curlies.</i>

932
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:09,497
<i>We were young, rich and in love.</i>

933
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:11,731
<i>Nothing could stop us.</i>

934
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,460
<i>It was perfect.</i>

935
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,097
Holy Mother of God.

936
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:28,575
Put that shit away.
You're pregnant, for Christ's sakes.

937
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:31,578
Don't be such a fucking hypocrite.

938
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,975
I quit smoking, didn't I?

939
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,534
Just put it away.
My fucking parents are here.

940
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:40,539
<i>Oh, my!</i>

941
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:45,017
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Oh, God, it's enormous!

942
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:47,415
Like it?

943
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,929
Look.

944
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,732
Look at this credenza.

945
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:56,530
Oh, yes. What, it's Spanish?

946
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:59,891
How much is one of these?
It's gotta cost a fortune.

947
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:02,932
- It's a family heirloom, Ma.
- I've seen these. They're not cheap.

948
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:06,052
Mirtha comes from
a very wealthy family.

949
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,455
- <i>Papi,</i> do you like it? Nice, eh?
- Very nice, yeah.

950
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:11,413
- I'll show you the rest of the house.
- Great.

951
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:15,579
George mentioned a Jacuzzi.
I've always wanted a Jacuzzi.

952
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:18,089
- And one of those bidets.
- Cocktail?

953
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,814
Yeah. You know, business
has been pretty good.

954
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:23,773
I got this little import/ export thing
going down in Miami.

955
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,653
That's been very profitable for me.
I got my investments.

956
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:29,692
- I got, uh--
- Don't bullshit me, George.

957
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:33,449
I don't want to waste the time.
I don't see you that much.

958
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:38,017
You come from my body, remember?
You're my baby boy.

959
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:42,452
Same kid who would jump off a mountain
if someone told him he couldn't do it.

960
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:46,459
You haven't changed
that much, have you?

961
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:49,492
Wow.

962
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:56,969
I know what you're up to.

963
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:00,172
Not everything,
but I get the picture.

964
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,576
And I don't care.

965
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:07,932
I don't like it. It's not
what I would have chosen for ya.

966
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:13,738
But it's your life.
It's got nothin' to do with me.

967
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:19,850
I couldn't stop you
if I wanted to, could I?

968
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,459
- Probably not.
- No.

969
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:25,214
It's good.

970
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,377
Got a family.

971
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,458
It's good if it makes you happy.

972
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,935
It's nice to have
nice things, George.

973
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,252
Are you happy?

974
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:44,578
Yeah. Yeah, at the moment,
I am happy, Dad.

975
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:55,895
Three years?
How long have we been in business?

976
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:58,534
Three years?
Does she get to meet your connection?

977
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,457
Was she good enough?

978
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:03,253
Shut up, Diego. Gonna be here
any minute. I'm trying to concentrate.

979
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:07,089
<i>Carajo,</i> okay? I'm very angry
with you, George. Very angry.

980
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:10,530
You don't take me to California,
but you take your bitch wife! A woman!

981
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,413
It was you and me who started this.
You and me!

982
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:17,010
What do you need my connection for?
What are you gonna do with it?

983
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:20,416
Nothing. It's for the principle.
It's for peace of mind.

984
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:22,690
Jesus fucking Christ!
I ain't tellin' you.

985
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:24,697
It's just business.
You're driving me fucking crazy.

986
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:27,254
I'm driving you fucking crazy?

987
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:29,257
You're driving me fucking crazy.

988
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:31,894
We had a dream.
What happened to our dream?

989
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:33,931
- Go inside. Go on.
- Shit.

990
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,616
I give you everything.
I give you everybody.

991
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:45,857
And what do you give me, George?
What do you give me?

992
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:50,370
No, no, amigo.
<i>No problema.</i>

993
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:54,375
<i>El dinero esta todo aqui,</i> right?

994
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,853
No problem.
We'll count this shit later.

995
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:04,290
You embarrassed me, George.
You made me look very bad.

996
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:07,258
Nothing. <i>Todo esta bien.</i>

997
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:11,498
No, everything is not right!
I bring you in, and you slap my face.

998
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,656
This is not the time, Diego.

999
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:20,492
No, listen. <i>Todo esta bien,</i> okay?
Take the keys and go.

1000
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:32,010
Oh, fuck.

1001
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:37,339
Oh, fuck.

1002
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:44,774
Everything's all right.
There's no problem.

1003
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:47,573
Okay? Never happened.

1004
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:50,612
Nobody has to know
anything about this.

1005
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:53,208
Diego, I want you to very calmly
tell these nice gentlemen...

1006
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,217
where the fucking cocaine is.

1007
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:56,693
Do it now!

1008
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:05,815
Nice doing business with you,
gentlemen. Good-bye.

1009
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:14,975
Derek Foreal!

1010
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:17,170
What?

1011
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:20,292
Derek Foreal.
Derek fucking Foreal, all right?

1012
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:22,775
Answer to all your fucking dreams.

1013
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,777
Happy now?

1014
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:38,938
Derek. Derek Foreal,
Diego Delgado.

1015
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:58,934
Thank you.

1016
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:10,217
Hey! I'm so happy
to see you two!

1017
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:13,252
Look at you. You're beautiful!
You're about to burst!

1018
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:14,859
I am.

1019
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,813
Tell her not to drink
too much, please.

1020
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:22,896
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Me too.

1021
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:25,090
- We have a lot to talk about.
- Where's Diego?

1022
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:27,017
He's not here.

1023
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:29,654
Where is he? And who the fuck
is this Norman Cay guy?

1024
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:32,499
Everybody's talking about Norman Cay.
Norman Cay this. Norman Cay that.

1025
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:35,896
- Do you know him?
- He's not a person.

1026
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:39,615
Norman's Cay is an island
in the Bahamas.

1027
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:43,892
From what they say, it's very peaceful,
and that's where Diego has his new home.

1028
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:46,693
As I understand it,
he's bought 160 acres.

1029
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:49,653
A hotel, a marina and an airstrip.

1030
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:53,011
He's doing multiple runs right now,
using the island as a jump-off point.

1031
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,892
- What?
- Yes.

1032
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:58,854
And Jack Stevens is already
a very busy man, along with many others.

1033
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:04,019
Oh, shit.

1034
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:17,419
Hello.

1035
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:20,498
Hello, Derek. George.

1036
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:24,215
Am I wearing lipstick?
I said, am I wearing lipstick?

1037
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:27,093
<i>While I'm getting fucked,</i>
<i>I wanna make sure my face looks pretty.</i>

1038
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:30,610
I don't wanna be in the middle of this.
That's between you and Diego.

1039
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,618
- I bring you into th-- Hang on.
- Happy New Year.

1040
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:37,415
Happy New Year, honey. I bring you in,
this is how you pay me back?

1041
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:39,496
Look, George,
it's nothing personal.

1042
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:41,815
I love you.
This is business.

1043
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:45,979
- <i>I gotta go, George.</i>
- Derek! Derek!

1044
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,059
What's wrong?

1045
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:55,452
- What?
- Nothin'. Happy New Year.

1046
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:18,338
Welcome, my friend.
It's been a long time.

1047
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:19,939
Don't touch me!

1048
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:29,773
Hey, happy to see you,
George, my brother.

1049
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:32,175
No more brothers, Diego.

1050
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:39,739
Why do you say that? You hurt me,
George. Of course we are brothers.

1051
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:42,457
You fucked me.

1052
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:45,856
I did not.

1053
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,777
Yeah, you did.

1054
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,209
You went behind my back.
You cut me out. You fucked me.

1055
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:54,049
Me? No. Never, George.

1056
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:55,932
Never.

1057
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:02,177
I talked to Derek.

1058
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:14,976
Well, maybe you're right.

1059
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:21,418
Maybe I did betray you
a little bit.

1060
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:30,135
Yeah.

1061
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:33,058
Yeah, I stole
your California connection.

1062
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:35,899
So what?

1063
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:39,490
Who introduced you
to Pablo Escobar?

1064
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:41,850
Me. Me.

1065
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:44,813
Who introduced you
to your fucking Colombian wife?

1066
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,500
Hmm? Me. Who protected you...

1067
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:52,296
when my friend Cesar Rosa wanted
to slice your fucking throat out?

1068
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:54,775
Huh? Me.

1069
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:58,654
Who made you make millions
and millions of dollars?

1070
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:01,010
Me.

1071
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,574
And what do I get in return?

1072
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,656
This.

1073
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:08,214
Accusations.

1074
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:13,449
I have always given you
everything, George.

1075
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:15,377
Always.

1076
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,774
But...

1077
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:22,532
that is over now.

1078
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:29,536
Yeah, this is my operation,
my dream. So go home.

1079
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:35,216
Go back home. Go home.
Go back to your stupid little life.

1080
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:39,253
Go back and sell half grams to your
relatives, for all I care, because--

1081
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:45,614
Because you're out.
And don't be so emotional, George.

1082
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:48,652
We're brothers.
We are brothers.

1083
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:51,533
Yeah!

1084
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:56,536
Next time, it's fucking loaded.

1085
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:03,053
Bye. Bye. Bye.

1086
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:16,296
Say hello to your
pretty wife for me.

1087
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:17,648
Sure.

1088
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,539
Hello.

1089
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,978
-Jesus Christ!
- It's all right, honey.

1090
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:31,254
- Look at you.
- It's okay.

1091
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:34,133
It's okay, baby. It's over.

1092
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:37,935
I quit the business. I'm out.

1093
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:43,737
It's all over,
and I'm not going back.

1094
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:49,058
It's just you and me and the baby.

1095
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:53,378
And there's nothing else.
There's just us.

1096
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:59,538
You know, fuck it.

1097
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,937
Fuck 'em.

1098
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:10,049
- Fuck them.
- Fuck 'em.

1099
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:11,977
Come here.

1100
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:16,337
Come here.

1101
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:21,136
<i>I did. I quit the business.</i>
<i>Got out completely.</i>

1102
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:23,774
<i>I mean, what the fuck. Why not?</i>

1103
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:27,336
<i>I'd made $60 million,</i>
<i>and I was out clean.</i>

1104
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:32,369
<i>Well, maybe I jumped</i>
<i>the gun on "clean".</i>

1105
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:35,253
- Let's go. The baby's coming!
- Right, right.

1106
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:37,974
I'm fucking coming!
Jesus Christ!

1107
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:41,331
George, hurry up!

1108
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:47,050
Georgie, let's go!

1109
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:49,978
Right, right, right!
What the fuck?

1110
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:01,657
I'll be right down.

1111
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:14,453
<i>Watching my baby girl being born</i>
<i>did something to me.</i>

1112
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:17,333
- Motherfucker!
- <i>They talk about religious experiences.</i>

1113
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:19,291
<i>I didn't believe in religion.</i>

1114
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:21,809
<i>Hell, I didn't even</i>
<i>particularly like kids.</i>

1115
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:24,295
<i>But when Kristina SunshineJung</i>
<i>came into this world...</i>

1116
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,251
<i>something in me changed.</i>

1117
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:28,848
<i>I knew what I was put</i>
<i>on the planet for.</i>

1118
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:31,414
<i>It was the greatest feeling</i>
<i>I ever had...</i>

1119
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:36,056
<i>followed very abruptly</i>
<i>by the worst feeling I ever had.</i>

1120
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:41,812
Call the cardiologist.
I think he's having a heart attack.

1121
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:51,448
<i>The official toxicity limit</i>
<i>for humans...</i>

1122
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:55,175
<i>is between one and one and a half grams</i>
<i>of cocaine, depending on body weight.</i>

1123
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:58,531
<i>I was averaging</i>
<i>five grams a day, maybe more.</i>

1124
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:01,493
<i>I snorted ten grams</i>
<i>in ten minutes once.</i>

1125
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,736
<i>I guess I had a high tolerance.</i>

1126
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:06,613
George, look, I'm not here
to give you lectures.

1127
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:09,732
I have no moral interest
in what you do or don't do.

1128
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:14,251
But take it easy, George.
Stay with us a while.

1129
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:16,689
You have a daughter now.

1130
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:23,656
A daughter.

1131
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:45,896
<i>I came home and cleaned up my act.</i>

1132
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:50,969
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>
<i>No drink, no nothing. Sober as a judge.</i>

1133
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:54,137
<i>My life was all about Kristina.</i>

1134
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:56,933
<i>Being with her, taking care of her.</i>

1135
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:00,097
<i>I wanted to be a father,</i>
<i>a good father...</i>

1136
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:02,575
<i>just like my old man was to me.</i>

1137
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:42,134
<i>After five years of laying low...</i>

1138
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:45,058
<i>still sober, Mirtha</i>
<i>needed to have some fun.</i>

1139
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:47,569
- Please excuse me for a minute.
- <i>So on my 38th birthday...</i>

1140
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:50,772
<i>she threw a little party</i>
<i>and invited some old friends.</i>

1141
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,731
Happy birthday, George.

1142
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:57,169
Mirtha invited me.

1143
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:59,734
Yeah, she told me.

1144
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:03,735
Look, I'm sorry about everything.

1145
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:07,057
You were right. I did fuck you.

1146
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:10,695
And Diego fucked me,
cut me out too.

1147
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:12,856
Yeah, I heard about it.

1148
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:16,211
I lost sight
of everything, George.

1149
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:18,251
Forgot who my friends were.

1150
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:24,052
Well, fuck it.
It's in the past.

1151
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:28,731
Just forget about it. I'm out of
the business, so we'll just move on.

1152
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:31,932
- Yeah.
- Good to see you, Derek.

1153
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:33,857
You too.

1154
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:39,739
- Let's get a drink.
- Who's cuttin' your hair?

1155
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:43,250
That's fucking funny, motherfuckers!

1156
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:45,814
Let's have some fucking fun!

1157
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:48,534
-Jesus, is that Mirtha?
- Yeah.

1158
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:50,457
Christ Almighty, George.

1159
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:53,014
What does she weigh, 80 pounds?

1160
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:56,610
Yeah, give or take. Come on.

1161
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,857
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1162
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:09,494
<i>Happy birthday, dear George</i>

1163
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:15,092
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1164
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:23,336
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

1165
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:25,496
<i>Waiters.</i>

1166
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:30,296
<i>I'm the only guy on the planet</i>
<i>gets busted by fucking waiters.</i>

1167
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:34,379
<i>Why the feds decided to bust me on</i>
<i>that particular night, I'll never know.</i>

1168
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:38,732
<i>Maybe it was the Porsches</i>
<i>and the Maseratis in the driveway...</i>

1169
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:41,499
<i>my Colombian guest list</i>
<i>or the cocaine buffet.</i>

1170
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:45,738
<i>Whatever it was, they were</i>
<i>just waiting for me to slip up.</i>

1171
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:48,657
<i>And I did.</i>

1172
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:30,452
What's this?

1173
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:32,969
This is your statement,
how it was all yours.

1174
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,011
The pound of cocaine
was for personal use...

1175
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:37,210
and none of the other guests
had any idea it was there.

1176
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:38,932
Yeah, right.

1177
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:48,136
I want my kid out of protective custody.
Now. No fucking around.

1178
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:51,332
My wife and my daughter
on a plane tonight.

1179
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:54,611
I sign this shit when I know
that they're safe and sound.

1180
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:58,415
- No fucking way.
- Well, fuck you. I sign nothing, then.

1181
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:06,056
Do it.

1182
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:09,058
Oh, you know what?
One more thing.

1183
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:11,819
- Yeah, what?
- Get me a six-pack.

1184
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:14,693
Yeah, right.

1185
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:22,453
<i>There was no way in the world</i>
<i>I was going back to prison.</i>

1186
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:26,937
<i>So I signed the deal,</i>
<i>took the rap and posted bail.</i>

1187
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:31,178
<i>Once again, I would become</i>
<i>a fugitive on the run.</i>

1188
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:39,173
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, George.

1189
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:47,810
- Ermine, your son is here.
- Tell him I don't want to see him.

1190
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:50,454
Tell him he's not welcome here.

1191
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:53,936
-Mom.
-Don't you dare step foot in this house.

1192
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:56,779
You're not my son.
You hear me?

1193
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:59,892
I don't have a son anymore.

1194
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:06,455
She's angry, George.

1195
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:09,299
It's been all over the news.

1196
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:15,970
Yeah. I just wanted
to let you guys know...

1197
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:19,490
that I'm gonna be going away
for a little while.

1198
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:23,811
You're not gonna go to trial?

1199
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:26,295
No.

1200
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:46,095
So this is it.

1201
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:50,294
I hope not, Pop.

1202
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:53,857
Me too.

1203
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:11,495
- I gotta go, Pop. I'll see you.
- You take care of yourself.

1204
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:13,417
You too.

1205
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:34,054
- Senor Jung.
- Yeah?

1206
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:38,412
I wish to present Senor Rodriguez.
He's the president of our bank.

1207
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:45,619
I am afraid that
there is a problem, Mr.Jung.

1208
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:50,416
The banks have gone through a change,
a nationalization.

1209
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:55,216
I am afraid that your funds
have been appropriated...

1210
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:57,808
by the Panamanian government.

1211
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,297
Please forgive me.

1212
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:05,129
Someone should have called you
from the bank earlier.

1213
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:07,376
My apologies, please.

1214
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:13,693
What are we going to do?

1215
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:16,533
- What are we going to do for money?
- Mirtha, please.

1216
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:19,777
I will talk to Augusto.
I'll start working for him.

1217
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:22,494
Just tell me!
Just answer the fucking question!

1218
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:26,454
What do we spend? What?
How will we live?

1219
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:28,730
Not in front of the kid.

1220
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:32,535
Don't give me that shit.
You just better do something.

1221
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:50,848
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
Don't be upset.

1222
01:29:50,980 --> 01:29:53,619
What's happening to us?

1223
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:57,497
I don't know.

1224
01:29:57,620 --> 01:30:00,532
Are we gonna get split up?

1225
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:03,572
No.Jesus, God,
don't even say that.

1226
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:07,734
Listen to me.
I love your mother.

1227
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:10,215
But she's upset right now.

1228
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:15,655
And you're my heart, kid.

1229
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:19,374
Now, could I live
without my heart?

1230
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,297
I hope not.

1231
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:26,930
Take it easy.
There's a fucking cop back there.

1232
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:30,132
- Right behind us.
-Just fucking drive.

1233
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:32,854
What is your fucking problem?

1234
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:38,619
We're broke. That's my fucking problem.
And you're a fucking spy.

1235
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:41,812
What?

1236
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:45,615
That's right.
Always spying, always judging.

1237
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:48,049
- Right.
- Everyone's laughing at you.

1238
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:50,410
- You fucking pussy.
- Thanks.

1239
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:52,531
You let Diego fuck you in the ass.

1240
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:55,015
- Right.
- Maybe because you like it.

1241
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:57,370
Maybe because
you are a fucking faggot.

1242
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,775
- Right.
- That's what I think you are.

1243
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:02,653
I think you are really fucking him,
because you're not fucking me.

1244
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:05,499
- You gotta be fucking somebody else.
- Mirtha, come on.

1245
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:07,372
- Why is that?
- Take it easy.

1246
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:10,139
- Why don't you fuck me anymore?
- Mirtha, take it easy.

1247
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:13,616
- Why? Why don't you fuck me anymore?
- Get over there, Mirtha!

1248
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:26,136
Don't you ever put your hands
on me, motherfucker!

1249
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:29,218
Don't you ever
touch me again, asshole!

1250
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:32,059
- Relax.
- Get your hands off me!

1251
01:31:32,180 --> 01:31:35,616
He's a fugitive
and a fucking cocaine dealer!

1252
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:38,618
He has a kilo
in his trunk right now!

1253
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:40,537
Look, look--

1254
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:43,652
Take this sorry
motherfucker to jail!

1255
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:24,696
<i>I'm divorcing you, George.</i>

1256
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:27,698
<i>And I'm getting custody</i>
<i>of Kristina.</i>

1257
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:33,011
<i>And when you get out next week,</i>
<i>you're gonna pay support.</i>

1258
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:36,530
<i>And that's the end of it, okay?</i>

1259
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:41,129
<i>There is someone else.</i>

1260
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:46,618
I don't think you care,
but I wanted to tell you.

1261
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,297
<i>Say something.</i>

1262
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:55,173
<i>What do you want me to say?</i>

1263
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:58,850
<i>I'm in prison.</i>

1264
01:32:58,980 --> 01:33:01,653
<i>You should know.</i>
<i>You put me in here.</i>

1265
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:04,738
I knew you would say
something like that.

1266
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:08,535
<i>Always thinking about yourself.</i>

1267
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:21,970
- <i>Say hello to your father.</i>
- My God.

1268
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,568
<i>- Go now. Say hello.</i>
<i>- No!</i>

1269
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:34,369
<i>Hello, sweetheart.</i>

1270
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:37,537
<i>I thought you couldn't live</i>
<i>without your heart.</i>

1271
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:13,058
<i>Every single day in thejoint</i>
<i>I thought of one thing.</i>

1272
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:17,173
<i>One thing only. My baby girl.</i>

1273
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:22,020
<i>I needed to get my heart back.</i>

1274
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:28,057
Bye, guys.

1275
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:30,933
Anna, sweetie, over here!

1276
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:37,976
Hi, honey.

1277
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:46,616
- Hi, honey.
- What are you doing here?

1278
01:34:46,740 --> 01:34:52,053
Well, I just wanted to let you know
I was out, and I wanted to see you.

1279
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:55,013
How are you doing?

1280
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:58,212
George, you just can't
show up like this.

1281
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:01,138
Why don't you try calling me Dad?

1282
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:04,138
I don't want to, all right?
Now leave me alone.

1283
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:06,057
Wait. Honey, listen.

1284
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:09,377
Kristina, I'm sorry.

1285
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:14,929
I wanna make everything
okay, you know?

1286
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:18,132
What do you want from me, huh?

1287
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:23,608
I want to be your dad again.

1288
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:26,459
I just wanna walk with you,
if you don't mind.

1289
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:31,448
I want to make everything okay.

1290
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:33,491
Please, Kristina.

1291
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:37,818
If you could go anywhere
in the world-- anywhere--

1292
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:40,010
where would you want to go?

1293
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:42,131
<i>I was making headway.</i>

1294
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:45,218
<i>Kristina and I walked</i>
<i>to and from school every day.</i>

1295
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:48,298
- <i>Things were starting to look up.</i>
- Maybe California.

1296
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:51,890
California? Well, you can go
anywhere in the world.

1297
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:55,979
You can go to India, Tibet,
Israel, France, whatever.

1298
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:59,012
- You'd still choose California?
- Yeah.

1299
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:01,574
- Yeah?
- Hey, Mom.

1300
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:06,293
All right.
Well, go-- go on inside.

1301
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:13,537
- Bye, Dad. See you in the morning.
- Okay. I'll be here.

1302
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:17,610
Hi, Mom.

1303
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:20,208
I'm gonna go inside
and do my homework.

1304
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:23,298
Okay, honey.
I'll be there in a minute.

1305
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:30,970
What do you want?

1306
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:33,056
A truce.

1307
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:36,297
I don't wanna fight
with you anymore, Mirtha.

1308
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:40,618
I just want to get along with you.
You know, be civil.

1309
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:47,015
You know I've been seeing
Kristina, right?

1310
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:51,053
Yeah, she told me.
You walk her to school.

1311
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:52,977
Yeah.

1312
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:57,176
Anyway, I've been thinkin'...

1313
01:36:57,300 --> 01:37:00,656
I love her.

1314
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:03,419
You know that. I--

1315
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:07,089
I was thinking I'd
kind of like to have her.

1316
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:11,569
I've been away for such
a long time, you know.

1317
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:14,851
I just--just wanna be with her.

1318
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:21,977
I haven't seen one dollar from you.
You haven't paid me one cent.

1319
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:26,528
Child support, alimony.

1320
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:33,649
You start helping us,
we'll see what will happen.

1321
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:40,609
All right. That's it.

1322
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:43,254
That's all I wanted to say.

1323
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:47,893
- Take care.
- You too.

1324
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:02,017
Are you okay?

1325
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:07,017
Yeah.

1326
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:11,891
<i>Hello? Derek, hey. George.</i>

1327
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:15,894
Look, I need to do something.

1328
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:19,569
I want to put together a crew, huh?
Know anybody?

1329
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:24,775
It's a four-man operation.
Two on the ground, two in the air.

1330
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:28,939
- Who's the copilot?
- You're lookin' at him.

1331
01:38:29,060 --> 01:38:33,133
We'll provide the plane, transportation
costs, U.S. landing spot...

1332
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:35,410
and we'll take it
wherever you want it to go.

1333
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:37,337
You provide a pickup point
in South America...

1334
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:39,132
and you're responsible for payment.

1335
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:41,933
You also assume all bust risk.

1336
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:45,177
After that, we take 65%
of all transportation fees...

1337
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:48,053
ten percent of the gross,
plus our expenses.

1338
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:51,968
This is not a negotiation, so if it's
okay with you, we can talk further.

1339
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:54,739
If not, forget we had
this conversation.

1340
01:38:54,860 --> 01:38:56,896
No, no. Everything sounds good.

1341
01:38:57,020 --> 01:38:59,898
I'm gonna need to meet
everybody involved, though.

1342
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:05,814
They're right there
at the table. Come on.

1343
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:08,454
Gentlemen, this is George.

1344
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:10,571
- George.
- What do you say?

1345
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:12,691
- Georgie! Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God, Dulli!

1346
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:16,699
- Dulli.Jesus.
- Oh, man, George. You look great.

1347
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:19,778
- Yeah, so do you.
- I've known this guy for 30 years.

1348
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:21,731
- George, Ben.
- Hey, Ben.

1349
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:24,374
- How are you doing? G.G. Have my seat.
- Nice to see ya.

1350
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:27,731
Heard you got married.

1351
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:32,058
- Hey, honey, you know what?
- What?

1352
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:35,092
I was thinking about getting
out of town this week.

1353
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:37,097
Where are you goin'?

1354
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:39,256
I don't know.
Maybe California.

1355
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:41,894
- Liar.
- Yeah.

1356
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:44,898
Go out there, check it out,
see what it's like.

1357
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:48,456
I got a few things I have to take care
of first, but I was thinking Thursday.

1358
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:50,377
Thursday after school?

1359
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:53,060
You know I can't.
Mom will never let me go.

1360
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:56,650
You let me take care of your mother.
You just pack your bags, okay?

1361
01:39:56,780 --> 01:39:59,010
- But I've got school.
- I know.

1362
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:02,655
But a good friend of mine told me
that they got schools in California too.

1363
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:04,930
- You swear?
- Yeah.

1364
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:08,052
3:00 Thursday, at your mother's.
You and me, huh?

1365
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:10,774
- It's a date.
- I don't believe you.

1366
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:16,291
I swear on my life,
scout's honor.

1367
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:18,934
Swear on my life.

1368
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:25,537
I swear on your life.

1369
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:51,052
All right!

1370
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:55,335
That's a nice boy.

1371
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:57,337
Go get him, Dulli.

1372
01:40:58,940 --> 01:41:00,737
Get in.

1373
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:08,459
Oh, yeah.

1374
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:11,219
- Are we good?
- Are we good?

1375
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:14,013
Yeah, we're good.
We're fucking beautiful.

1376
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:15,937
We're perfect.

1377
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:19,894
This is grade-A, 100% pure Colombian
cocaine, ladies and gentlemen.

1378
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:23,569
Disco shit.
Pure as the driven snow.

1379
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:26,294
- Nice.
- Good fucking riddance.

1380
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:28,217
Yeah?

1381
01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:30,296
- You saved my fucking life.
- No, I didn't.

1382
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:33,093
No shit. You'll never know.
Really. All you guys.

1383
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:35,256
- Really.
- Yeah, yeah.

1384
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:37,974
And being as how I'm feelin'
so fuckin' generous tonight...

1385
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:40,568
you just got a raise.

1386
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:43,339
- A raise?
- Yeah.

1387
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:46,258
Instead of ten percent,
you're gonna get fifteen.

1388
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:51,056
Jesus, George, 15 percent?
That's an extra 200 grand.

1389
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:54,889
That's right. Fuck it. Do whatever
you want with it. Have a nice life.

1390
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:58,899
I'm out. <i>Finito.</i>
Last fuckin' party.

1391
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:03,411
I'm gonna go out to California,
start a new life with my kid.

1392
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:05,815
Here's to it.

1393
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:08,010
- Cheers.
- Here's to you, Georgie.

1394
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:10,734
- Cheers.
- Here's to you, Georgie.

1395
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:13,169
Cheers. All right, fellas.

1396
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:15,655
- Dulli.
- Yeah?

1397
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:18,499
How about another round?
I'm gonna hit the head.

1398
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:22,295
I feel like a fuckin' kid today.

1399
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:38,612
What?

1400
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:40,731
I feel bad.

1401
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:42,657
Me too.

1402
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:45,692
I like him too,
but what's done is done.

1403
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:48,618
So let's not get all sentimental
about it, all right?

1404
01:42:57,201 --> 01:42:59,874
Hey, Dulli, you know
what I was thinking?

1405
01:43:00,001 --> 01:43:02,799
I was remembering that--
that time we flew into Mexico.

1406
01:43:02,921 --> 01:43:04,912
You remember that fucking
landing strip? Right?

1407
01:43:05,041 --> 01:43:07,509
- Yeah.
- Fucking nuts.

1408
01:43:09,001 --> 01:43:11,071
You're much better now.

1409
01:43:18,321 --> 01:43:20,471
What's going on?

1410
01:43:20,601 --> 01:43:23,877
What the fuck?
What's with the long faces?

1411
01:43:30,721 --> 01:43:32,996
Where's my fuckin' knife?

1412
01:43:54,361 --> 01:43:56,158
No.

1413
01:44:05,721 --> 01:44:07,632
Let's do it.

1414
01:44:22,041 --> 01:44:24,032
<i>I was busted.</i>

1415
01:44:24,161 --> 01:44:28,234
<i>Set up by the FBI and the DEA--</i>
<i>that didn't bother me.</i>

1416
01:44:28,361 --> 01:44:32,036
<i>Set up by Kevin Dulli and Derek Foreal</i>
<i>to save their own asses--</i>

1417
01:44:32,161 --> 01:44:33,913
<i>that didn't bother me.</i>

1418
01:44:34,041 --> 01:44:37,158
<i>Sentenced to 60 years at Otisville--</i>

1419
01:44:37,281 --> 01:44:39,158
<i>that didn't bother me.</i>

1420
01:44:42,161 --> 01:44:44,755
<i>I'd broken a promise.</i>

1421
01:44:44,881 --> 01:44:47,953
<i>Everything I love</i>
<i>in my life goes away.</i>

1422
01:45:01,641 --> 01:45:03,836
- Hey, Arch.
- What's goin' on?

1423
01:45:03,961 --> 01:45:05,314
Well--

1424
01:45:09,241 --> 01:45:11,709
- You all right?
- I'm good.

1425
01:45:14,401 --> 01:45:16,198
Fuck.

1426
01:45:19,801 --> 01:45:21,792
What do you got?

1427
01:45:21,921 --> 01:45:23,832
Bad news.

1428
01:45:23,961 --> 01:45:28,193
Tried to get you furloughed,
but your mom squashed it.

1429
01:45:29,601 --> 01:45:32,877
Said it would only upset him.

1430
01:45:33,001 --> 01:45:36,118
So, doesn't look good.

1431
01:45:43,241 --> 01:45:45,152
How's he doin'?

1432
01:45:45,281 --> 01:45:48,751
Not good.
He's out of the hospital. He's home.

1433
01:45:48,881 --> 01:45:53,159
But I don't think there's anything
anyone can do for him.

1434
01:45:53,281 --> 01:45:56,159
I think it's just
a matter of time.

1435
01:45:59,521 --> 01:46:01,318
Got you a tape recorder.

1436
01:46:01,441 --> 01:46:05,150
I thought, you know,
he might want to hear your voice.

1437
01:46:05,281 --> 01:46:07,397
If you want to say
something to him.

1438
01:46:07,521 --> 01:46:09,637
Right.

1439
01:46:09,761 --> 01:46:12,195
I'll give you five.

1440
01:46:41,041 --> 01:46:42,838
Hello, Dad.

1441
01:46:46,601 --> 01:46:49,195
You know, I remember
a lifetime ago...

1442
01:46:49,321 --> 01:46:51,960
I was about
three-and-a-half feet tall...

1443
01:46:52,081 --> 01:46:55,869
weighing all of 60 pounds,
but every inch your son.

1444
01:46:58,081 --> 01:47:00,834
<i>Those Saturday mornings</i>
<i>going to work with my dad...</i>

1445
01:47:00,961 --> 01:47:04,715
<i>and we'd climb</i>
<i>into that big green truck.</i>

1446
01:47:04,841 --> 01:47:10,279
<i>I thought that truck was</i>
<i>the biggest truck in the universe, Pop.</i>

1447
01:47:10,401 --> 01:47:13,040
<i>I remember how important</i>
<i>thejob we did was.</i>

1448
01:47:13,161 --> 01:47:17,632
<i>How, if it weren't for us,</i>
<i>people would freeze to death.</i>

1449
01:47:20,361 --> 01:47:23,239
I thought you were
the strongest man in the world.

1450
01:47:25,321 --> 01:47:28,996
<i>Remember those home movies when Mom</i>
<i>would dress up like Loretta Young?</i>

1451
01:47:29,121 --> 01:47:33,399
<i>Ice creams and football games?</i>
<i>Waino, the Tuna?</i>

1452
01:47:33,521 --> 01:47:37,673
<i>Day I left for California, only to come</i>
<i>home with the FBI chasing me?</i>

1453
01:47:37,801 --> 01:47:39,632
<i>That FBI agent, Trout...</i>

1454
01:47:39,761 --> 01:47:42,639
<i>when he had to get on his knees</i>
<i>to put my boots on, you said--</i>

1455
01:47:42,761 --> 01:47:45,798
That's where you belong,
you son of a bitch.

1456
01:47:45,921 --> 01:47:47,991
Puttin' on Georgie's boots.

1457
01:47:49,281 --> 01:47:51,590
That was a good one, Dad.

1458
01:47:51,721 --> 01:47:53,837
That was really something.

1459
01:47:53,961 --> 01:47:55,758
You remember that?

1460
01:47:58,561 --> 01:48:01,519
<i>And that time you told me</i>
<i>that money wasn't real?</i>

1461
01:48:02,881 --> 01:48:06,590
Well, old man, I'm 42 years old...

1462
01:48:06,721 --> 01:48:09,110
and I finally realize...

1463
01:48:09,241 --> 01:48:11,709
what you were trying to tell me...

1464
01:48:11,841 --> 01:48:15,311
so many years ago.

1465
01:48:15,441 --> 01:48:17,397
I finally understand.

1466
01:48:21,641 --> 01:48:23,393
You're the best, Dad.

1467
01:48:24,961 --> 01:48:27,555
<i>I just wish I could've</i>
<i>done more for you.</i>

1468
01:48:27,681 --> 01:48:29,672
<i>I wish we had more time.</i>

1469
01:48:31,121 --> 01:48:32,918
Anyway...

1470
01:48:36,041 --> 01:48:38,760
"May the wind
always be at your back...

1471
01:48:38,881 --> 01:48:41,793
and the sun
always upon your face...

1472
01:48:41,921 --> 01:48:44,799
<i>and the winds of destiny</i>
<i>to carry you aloft...</i>

1473
01:48:44,921 --> 01:48:47,389
- <i>to dance with the stars. "</i>
- "Dance with the stars."

1474
01:48:55,201 --> 01:48:57,192
I love you, Dad.

1475
01:48:58,761 --> 01:49:01,070
Love, George.

1476
01:49:20,801 --> 01:49:24,510
George. George, come on.
You have a visitor.

1477
01:49:51,681 --> 01:49:53,433
Hello, sweetheart.

1478
01:49:57,521 --> 01:49:59,318
Hi, Daddy.

1479
01:50:01,961 --> 01:50:04,429
God, you're so big.

1480
01:50:10,321 --> 01:50:12,516
Daddy's a fuckup.

1481
01:50:14,361 --> 01:50:15,680
No.

1482
01:50:19,601 --> 01:50:21,398
Come here.

1483
01:50:25,681 --> 01:50:28,514
You're the only thing
in my life ever meant anything.

1484
01:50:28,641 --> 01:50:31,394
- You swear?
- I swear, baby.

1485
01:50:33,201 --> 01:50:35,317
I swear.

1486
01:50:35,441 --> 01:50:38,353
I love you, Kristina.

1487
01:50:38,481 --> 01:50:41,757
You're the only
good thing in my life.

1488
01:50:41,881 --> 01:50:44,111
You're the only thing
ever meant anything to me.

1489
01:50:45,641 --> 01:50:46,915
I love you.

1490
01:50:57,161 --> 01:50:59,550
Come on, let's go.

1491
01:51:05,481 --> 01:51:08,200
So, tell me about your life.

1492
01:51:08,321 --> 01:51:09,959
What do you want to know?

1493
01:51:10,081 --> 01:51:13,153
Everything, I mean--
What do you do?

1494
01:51:13,281 --> 01:51:15,749
- You go to school? Do you--
- Sometimes.

1495
01:51:15,881 --> 01:51:17,712
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1496
01:51:17,841 --> 01:51:20,071
-Just like the old man.
- Yeah.

1497
01:51:20,201 --> 01:51:24,479
George. Let's go.
It's gettin' dark.

1498
01:51:25,801 --> 01:51:28,190
Come on. It's gettin' late.

1499
01:51:31,161 --> 01:51:33,470
Come on, let's go.

1500
01:51:37,281 --> 01:51:39,317
Let's go.

1501
01:51:40,481 --> 01:51:42,437
I got a visitor.

1502
01:51:42,561 --> 01:51:45,394
Not today, George.
Time to go back.

1503
01:51:46,881 --> 01:51:51,079
Yeah, but I want to put her
on the list for tomorrow.

1504
01:51:51,201 --> 01:51:52,680
It's my daughter.

1505
01:51:54,721 --> 01:51:58,077
She's gonna visit me.
My daughter's gonna visit me tomorrow.

1506
01:51:58,201 --> 01:52:00,999
<i>So in the end, was it worth it?</i>

1507
01:52:01,121 --> 01:52:03,874
- It's lockdown time.
- <i>Jesus Christ.</i>

1508
01:52:04,001 --> 01:52:07,311
<i>How irreparably changed</i>
<i>my life has become.</i>

1509
01:52:07,441 --> 01:52:09,716
<i>It's always the last day of summer...</i>

1510
01:52:09,841 --> 01:52:13,390
<i>and I've been left out in the cold</i>
<i>with no door to get back in.</i>

1511
01:52:13,521 --> 01:52:17,400
<i>I'll grant you, I've had more</i>
<i>than my share of poignant moments.</i>

1512
01:52:17,521 --> 01:52:19,398
<i>Life passes most people by...</i>

1513
01:52:19,521 --> 01:52:22,433
<i>while they're making</i>
<i>grand plans for it.</i>

1514
01:52:22,561 --> 01:52:24,438
<i>Throughout my lifetime...</i>

1515
01:52:24,561 --> 01:52:27,075
<i>I've left pieces of my heart</i>
<i>here and there...</i>

1516
01:52:27,201 --> 01:52:30,238
<i>and now there's almost</i>
<i>not enough to stay alive.</i>

1517
01:52:30,361 --> 01:52:32,511
<i>But I force a smile...</i>

1518
01:52:32,641 --> 01:52:36,190
<i>knowing that my ambition</i>
<i>far exceeded my talent.</i>

1519
01:52:37,601 --> 01:52:42,117
<i>There are no more white horses</i>
<i>or pretty ladies at my door.</i>
