Damien's father led the last

His unfortunate death pushed
legislation for us to erect the border.

He's a hero, and from what
I hear, you're a lot like him.

Thank you.

What are they transporting?

363
00:33:52,758 --> 00:33:56,788
N.A.D, Neutron Assisted Device.
A neutron bomb.

364
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,038
We prefer the word device.

365
00:33:58,038 --> 00:34:00,089
Bomb has such negative connonations.

366
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:03,036
The device was fitted with
an anti theft mechanism.

00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:07,348
Which is triggered if the case
should be open the wrong way.

We don't know where it's at,
we don't know who has it.

Ex-soldier turned illegal arms dealer.

He uses military grade weapons,
united the gangs,

I spent my entire career
trying to take down Tremaine.

383
00:34:40,715 --> 00:34:43,735
But he never leaves Brick Mansions
and there's checkpoints everywhere.

is to send me into this shit

00:43:57,837 --> 00:44:00,930
And I wouldn't wanna be
old when he gets here.

485
00:44:00,961 --> 00:44:04,992
Tremaine, we all good on the roof.
Do you wanna head back?

486
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,095
Rayzah here will keep you company.

487
00:44:13,365 --> 00:44:15,385
Yo, get your hands of my chips.

488
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:18,467
Oh, shit.

489
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:19,613
Move!

(GRUNTING)

492
00:44:39,535 --> 00:44:43,524
- How did you know I was a cop?
- You don't belong here.

493
00:44:44,607 --> 00:44:47,627
- How did you find me?
- I put a bug in your pocket.

494
00:44:53,844 --> 00:44:57,968
Cop's tricks.
That's all you people have.

495
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,165
No, we have the law.
It just something you don't care about.

496
00:45:00,207 --> 00:45:02,186
The law means nothing without justice.

497
00:45:02,186 --> 00:45:04,237
That's pretty high for somebody
who killed a cop.

498
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:07,393
That cop was a corrupt piece of shit,
no better than Tremaine.

499
00:45:07,507 --> 00:45:09,580
I'm gonna find Tremaine.

500
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,642
I'm gonna find him before
the weapon he hijacked

501
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,745
kills everybody inside
the Brick Mansions.

502
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:16,849
Probably didn't occur to you there's
somebody on the outside

503
00:45:16,891 --> 00:45:19,140
that actually gives a shit about
what happen in here now did you?

504
00:45:21,993 --> 00:45:24,243
Not everybody out there is an asshole.

505
00:45:24,253 --> 00:45:28,377
Just like not everybody in here
is a junkie or a thief.

506
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:31,377
You enjoy yourself.

507
00:45:31,408 --> 00:45:33,657
And if I find your girlfriend
I'll tell her you said hi.

508
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:36,688
They will shoot you and
take your badge as trophy.

509
00:45:36,688 --> 00:45:38,666
At least I'll die trying.

510
00:45:38,677 --> 00:45:42,832
Which is a hell lot better than sitting around
bitching about how the world sucks.

511
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:49,268
If you're not bullshitting about that bomb,
maybe I can save Lola before we all go down.

512
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,142
And the first chance you get,
what are you gonna do?

513
00:45:52,194 --> 00:45:54,235
You gonna put a bullet
in the back of my head?

514
00:45:54,235 --> 00:45:56,527
I could've kill you already.

515
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:12,137
So what's your plan?

516
00:46:12,241 --> 00:46:15,189

Tremaine, it's Lino.
I'm coming over.

520
00:46:29,893 --> 00:46:32,913
So that's it?
You just throwing him a line?

521
00:46:32,913 --> 00:46:35,027
A line he'll never expect.

522
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:39,266
This is gonna be a lot of fun.

- (LOLA GRUNTING)

Hey, Rayzah.
I heard shouts.

532
00:48:40,965 --> 00:48:44,016
You can play but not too hard, okay?

00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:46,235

Take us to Tremaine.

We got a guest coming!

Surprised that your back here so soon.

You see?
He is surprised.

544
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:55,978
- Who's your boy?
- I'm his driver.

- Thanks. Thanks for that.

- That's great.
- Wow, a cop.

Haven't seen one of those
around here in years.

549
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:13,588
I believe the police station closed around
the same time as the school, the hospital.

550
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,754
The government thought
we didn't need that around here.

I cause anxious.

before this thing goes off

or you can make me an offer.

00:50:42,758 --> 00:50:45,038
I'll offer you to disable it before
it blows us all up, you like that?

That won't fly. How about I just
send it back the way I found it?

and I got a pretty woman.

- Do I hear 11?
- 11.

- 11 million.
- 12

- 15? Stop the bullshit!

How much the people downtown worth?

people lives aren't worth a shit.

this used to be a palace.

only 48 minutes before it blows up.

- How do we proceed?
- You have an Hawaiian bank account?

- I want it in cash, man.
- They can't do cash.

- We still got an account in Hawaii?
- We do.

- All right, good.

let my man verify the transfer.

640
00:55:02,287 --> 00:55:05,245
Bank doesn't open for another 25 minutes.

641
00:55:05,245 --> 00:55:06,380
25 minutes.

642
00:55:06,422 --> 00:55:08,567
Well, that's enough time for me
to finish dinner.

643
00:55:08,577 --> 00:55:10,525
K2.

644
00:55:10,525 --> 00:55:13,514
Show our guests to the presidential suite.

645
00:55:14,524 --> 00:55:16,742
Nice doing business with you, Sheriff.

646
00:55:16,784 --> 00:55:17,679
Move!

647
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,939
Sometimes you dont gotta be a rocket scientist.

648
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:22,032
Just got to have a rocket.

649
00:55:46,974 --> 00:55:48,120
Move!

650
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,098
Face the rack!

651
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,108
- On your knees!
- Shit.

652
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:54,233
Put your damn hands behind your head!

653
00:55:54,243 --> 00:55:57,295
I got to tell you,
I'm claustrophobic.

654
00:55:58,482 --> 00:56:02,397
Until Tremaine gets his 30 million,
their lives worth more than both of us.

655
00:56:02,439 --> 00:56:05,532
They die, you die.

656
00:56:11,895 --> 00:56:13,874
So you're not having a plan gets us in.

657
00:56:13,874 --> 00:56:16,154
Hey, you know where the bomb is,
I know where Lola is.

658
00:56:16,196 --> 00:56:18,248
And in 25 minutes, we act.

659
00:56:18,248 --> 00:56:20,320
In 25 minutes Tremaine is gonna shoot us.

660
00:56:20,372 --> 00:56:22,476
The device is gonna kill 3 million people.

661
00:56:22,486 --> 00:56:25,579
What? When he gets his money,
everybody walks away.

662
00:56:25,579 --> 00:56:26,683
There is no money.

663
00:56:26,694 --> 00:56:29,578
The city can't pay.
I was just trying to buy us some time.

664
00:56:29,578 --> 00:56:30,713
Forget what I said before.

665
00:56:30,765 --> 00:56:33,744
Don't trust your instinct.
They're shit.

666
00:56:33,952 --> 00:56:36,004
I should've killed Tremaine
when I had the chance.

667
00:56:36,004 --> 00:56:38,024
Shut up.

668
00:56:40,076 --> 00:56:41,180
Wait.

669
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:44,377
That story about Tremaine killing
your friend, it's true?

670
00:56:45,179 --> 00:56:48,480
That's my father. He used to
lead some officers on a drug raid.

671
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,645
He got separated from his squad.
Tremaine's boys captured him and killed him.

672
00:56:52,687 --> 00:56:54,562
I'm sorry.

673
00:56:55,676 --> 00:56:58,769
Let's go make him pay.
Back me up.

674
00:57:02,976 --> 00:57:05,017
Help him man!

675
00:57:06,236 --> 00:57:09,225
Stop it!

676
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,412
- Son of a bitch.
- What happened?

677
00:57:11,453 --> 00:57:13,317
Oh, shit.

678
00:57:13,328 --> 00:57:14,567
- He's not breathing.
- What?

679
00:57:14,578 --> 00:57:16,525
We got to get him out of here.

680
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,608
Shit.

681
00:57:18,743 --> 00:57:21,628
- Oh, come on!
- He's not breathing, come on!

682
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,877
- Okay, go!
- Open the gate!

683
00:57:23,888 --> 00:57:25,794
I will talk to the boss.

684
00:57:27,855 --> 00:57:29,064
Go!

685
00:57:37,343 --> 00:57:40,425
- Something's not right about this.
- You think they'll come up with the money?

686
00:57:40,436 --> 00:57:41,498
We'll see.

687
00:57:41,508 --> 00:57:42,612
Tell me how you got that bomb again.

688
00:57:42,623 --> 00:57:46,778
Bomb? Yeah. These dudes at base told
me about some weapon being moved.

689
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:49,881
No security.
Keys left in the truck.

690
00:57:49,881 --> 00:57:51,860
Easy money, baby.

691
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:55,120
That's whats bothering me man.
You can never trust easy.

692
00:58:01,285 --> 00:58:03,420
- I'm okay.
- You're crazy.

693
00:58:03,472 --> 00:58:06,450
We're out of the room.
Your turn cop.

694
00:58:06,461 --> 00:58:09,720
Is this some kind of game to you?

695
00:58:10,626 --> 00:58:11,803
On three.

696
00:58:12,855 --> 00:58:14,761
Three!

697
00:58:26,268 --> 00:58:28,309
Go, go, go!

This way!

It's them!

00:58:33,527 --> 00:58:34,662
Go, go, go!

701
00:58:34,672 --> 00:58:37,692
- You know where we going?
- More or less.

702

What the fuck?

00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,842
Different method, same result.

- But you still need the key.

709
00:59:32,981 --> 00:59:34,887
Go, go!

710
00:59:34,897 --> 00:59:36,168
I'll drive.

Let's get these guys!

714
00:59:53,622 --> 00:59:54,798
Faster!

715
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:06,295
- Faster!
- You wanna drive?

716
01:00:06,337 --> 01:00:08,410
- Go ahead, drive.
- Whoah, whoah.

717
01:00:11,378 --> 01:00:12,409
I need to get out.

718
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:14,471
What are you trying to do
Jumping out of the damn car for?

719
01:00:14,471 --> 01:00:15,751
- Where you going?
- I'm trying to get rid of these guys.

720
01:00:15,793 --> 01:00:17,730
Will you shut up?

721
01:00:32,258 --> 01:00:34,403
I don't see them!

722
01:00:39,735 --> 01:00:42,651
- Rooftops back that way!
- Why didn't you tell me that?

723
01:00:42,651 --> 01:00:44,900
- Come on, tell me, which way?
- Left, left!

724
01:00:56,241 --> 01:00:58,418

We don't have much time!

725

Back where?

I told you to stay down!

730

Look, we can't just run to that rooftop.
They're gonna be expecting us.

- You got a better solution?
- I'm working on it.

Can you work while you run?

Okay.
I'm gonna bring it up right now.

748
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:00,931
We have an issue.

749
01:05:01,004 --> 01:05:04,024
These are satellite surveillance
images from Brick Mansions

750

taken several minutes ago.

- There's the bomb.
- What's that?

752
01:05:08,158 --> 01:05:11,532
That's an old Russian missile.
Has a radius about 5 miles.

753
01:05:11,564 --> 01:05:15,459
- How the hell did they get that?
- Wait, if they launch that...

754
01:05:15,459 --> 01:05:17,604
- The city is ground zero.
- We're gonna have to evacuate.

755
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:19,624
- No time.
- There's a fallout shelter.

756
01:05:19,635 --> 01:05:21,769
It won't help us against the NAD blast.

757

What options do we have then?
Drone?

758
01:05:22,967 --> 01:05:26,956
Too late. We'll never get
authorization just like that.

759
01:05:32,204 --> 01:05:34,423
- Bank is open.
- I'll check.

760
01:05:40,619 --> 01:05:43,608
I think they fooled us.
No deposit.

761
01:05:43,608 --> 01:05:45,826
And you wonder why people
don't trust the government.

What the hell is going on?

763
01:05:50,908 --> 01:05:52,918
Not only did they not make the transfer.

764
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:57,229
They're emptying all of our bank accounts.

- Looks like they shot the launch mechanism.

- The missile can't launch.
- We're still in the game.

do it or die trying.

Fuck!

801
01:10:05,126 --> 01:10:07,199
Fuck!

802
01:11:27,481 --> 01:11:30,428
What are you doing?
Hurry up!

803
01:11:30,574 --> 01:11:33,448
He's really pissed off!

804
01:11:33,521 --> 01:11:35,812
Hurry!

805
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:29,945
It's a great future,
you can't forget your past.

806
01:12:29,955 --> 01:12:32,871
I told you Tremaine's all bluff.

807
01:12:38,047 --> 01:12:40,192
No, Tremaine Alexander don't bluff.

808
01:12:40,203 --> 01:12:42,254
Nor do I make a stupid bet.

809
01:12:43,264 --> 01:12:45,483
Untie her.
This game is over.

810
01:12:45,556 --> 01:12:47,565
What are you talking about?

811
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:51,658
I'm a businessman.
I'm not gonna kill millions of people.

812
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:54,897
They will come to disarm this thing.

813
01:12:54,907 --> 01:12:57,782
We need to get out of here
before we all get fried.

814
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,979
- You gone soft.
- You watch your tone, woman.

815
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:04,041
Watch my tone?
What is wrong with you?

816
01:13:04,072 --> 01:13:06,155
Untie the girl!

817
01:13:06,165 --> 01:13:08,373
Maybe I should just kill you
and do this myself.

818
01:13:16,798 --> 01:13:19,703
Who's the bitch now?

819
01:13:20,932 --> 01:13:23,806
(SCREAMING)

820
01:13:26,077 --> 01:13:29,055
(THUDDING, GLASS SHATTER)

821
01:13:29,097 --> 01:13:33,294
(PANTING)

822
01:13:41,604 --> 01:13:42,843
Get away from her!

823
01:13:45,707 --> 01:13:46,915
It's okay. It's okay.

824
01:13:46,926 --> 01:13:48,967
I'm so glad you boys
came to save everyone, man.

825
01:13:49,009 --> 01:13:50,071
Not everyone.

826
01:13:52,102 --> 01:13:56,163
Hey, Lino. They're gonna text the code.
You punch it in.

827
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:00,370
- Now get down on your knees.
- No, wait.

828
01:14:00,506 --> 01:14:02,526
Let him explain.

829
01:14:02,589 --> 01:14:04,671
You want to shoot an unarmed man, Sheriff?

830
01:14:04,682 --> 01:14:07,556
At least you know the shot is coming,
it's better than my father.

831
01:14:07,598 --> 01:14:10,889
- What have i got to do with your father?
- Liutenant John Collier.

832
01:14:12,013 --> 01:14:15,929
- You still blame me for that one?
- You shot him in your headquarters.

833
01:14:15,971 --> 01:14:17,147
Wait.

834
01:14:19,241 --> 01:14:21,178
He never entered the building of mine.

835
01:14:21,188 --> 01:14:22,427
I saw the whole thing from
my surveillance camera.

836
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:25,520
His own man shot him in the back
and left him for death on my doorstep.

837
01:14:25,531 --> 01:14:26,593
A cold blooded setup.

838
01:14:26,603 --> 01:14:29,551
Your full of shit.
Now get down on your knees.

839
01:14:30,498 --> 01:14:32,602
- Get down on your knees!
- Damien.

840
01:14:32,758 --> 01:14:34,831
- There's a problem.
- What? The number didn't come through?

841
01:14:34,872 --> 01:14:36,945
No, it did.

842
01:14:36,997 --> 01:14:41,121
- 48216.
- That's the code.

843
01:14:41,131 --> 01:14:44,151
- Punch it in.
- It's a setup.

844
01:14:44,255 --> 01:14:46,307
We can't trust those people.

845
01:14:47,421 --> 01:14:50,337
- Punch it in.
- Listen to your man.

846
01:14:50,368 --> 01:14:52,482
They played you for a fool
the way they played your father.

847
01:14:52,493 --> 01:14:53,628
Shut up!

848
01:14:55,763 --> 01:14:57,700
Give me that.

849
01:14:58,814 --> 01:15:01,876
Damien.
Think about it.

850
01:15:01,876 --> 01:15:04,896
- Why is it our ZIP code?
- It's a coincidence.

851
01:15:04,969 --> 01:15:07,114
- Give me the phone.
- My instinct says you'll be arming it.

852
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:11,113
You're gonna get us all killed.
Give me the phone.

853
01:15:15,321 --> 01:15:17,643
- Lino!
- Sorry partner.

854
01:15:25,849 --> 01:15:27,828
I'm sorry.

855
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:31,087
Back off.

856
01:15:31,931 --> 01:15:34,149
Stop both of you!

857
01:15:48,854 --> 01:15:51,843
Stay down!

858
01:16:02,194 --> 01:16:04,413
Please! Hurry up!

859
01:16:39,685 --> 01:16:41,768
Damien!

860
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:44,871
- Collier!
- COMPUTER VOICE: 20 seconds.

861
01:16:44,871 --> 01:16:48,964
Don't you see?
They told you the van was hijacked.

862
01:16:49,276 --> 01:16:53,380
How come the van had no traces
with that harpoon anywhere on it.

863
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:59,493
We got 20 seconds to decide
about the rest of life.

864
01:17:01,753 --> 01:17:08,845
COMPUTER VOICE:
Five, four, three, two, one.

865
01:17:12,177 --> 01:17:15,093
COMPUTER VOICE:
Countdown completed.

866
01:17:23,476 --> 01:17:25,580
Jokes on me.

867
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:29,860
The law never protected this place before.
Why would it start now?

868
01:17:32,891 --> 01:17:36,077
I've done many bad things,
but killing your father wasn't one of them.

869
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:50,438
I'm making Detroit safer for all.

870
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:02,175
Welcome to our world.

871
01:18:04,195 --> 01:18:07,309
So, what are we gonna do
with this shit?

872
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:16,526
Let's give it back.

873
01:18:29,075 --> 01:18:33,178
- For you Captain.
- Thank you son.

874
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:51,996
- Hold it!
- Let's go!

875
01:18:52,017 --> 01:18:56,172
Hey, come on, no stairs!
Elevator! Let's go, now!

876
01:19:05,566 --> 01:19:08,659
- This is better than the stairs.
- Yeah.

877
01:19:13,866 --> 01:19:16,115
(CLAMORING)

878
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:25,300
I can't reach him.

879
01:19:25,373 --> 01:19:28,518
We don't have a satellite image.
If the bomb went off, we would've heard it.

880
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:31,590
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

881
01:19:32,528 --> 01:19:34,777
He's our man.
He'll get back to us.

882
01:19:35,798 --> 01:19:36,902
Hello.

883
01:19:38,016 --> 01:19:40,901
What do you mean
they're inside the building?

884
01:19:47,191 --> 01:19:51,346
Hey, you boys remember Lino?
My eyes in Brick Mansions?

885
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:54,554
Well, he showed me a lot.

886
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:59,656
Mr. Mayor.
Great place you got here.

887
01:20:05,957 --> 01:20:11,195
Tremaine Alexander.
I'm like the Mayor of Brick Mansions.

888
01:20:11,237 --> 01:20:14,226
It's a pleasure to meet my constituter.

889
01:20:14,465 --> 01:20:19,433
On behalf on myself,
a new appointed Sheriff and Lino

890
01:20:19,443 --> 01:20:22,495
and the citizen of Brick Mansions.

891
01:20:22,536 --> 01:20:26,691
We decided to give you
a campaign contribution.

892
01:20:26,702 --> 01:20:28,806
- COMPUTER VOICE: Device activated.
- What's going on?

893
01:20:28,816 --> 01:20:30,930
Believe it or not,
I forgot the damn code.

894
01:20:30,972 --> 01:20:34,200
- What was it? 4-8...
- Detective.

895
01:20:34,210 --> 01:20:39,168
- We can take it from here.
- 2-1-6.

896
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:40,240
Are you sure about that?

897
01:20:40,292 --> 01:20:41,500
I think Lino, you said it couldn't be 6

898
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,448
because that was the ZIP code
for Brick Mansions.

899
01:20:43,489 --> 01:20:45,395
It will be too much of a coincidence?

900
01:20:45,395 --> 01:20:48,613
You said it was a coincidence.
I said they wanted to blow us up.

901
01:20:48,665 --> 01:20:50,873
Yeah, I think all that jumping around
rooftops has us losing it.

902
01:20:50,883 --> 01:20:53,872
You hit your head one too many times.
You're having a hard time to remember.

903
01:20:53,914 --> 01:20:55,851
Gentleman, thank you very
much, we'll take it...

904
01:20:55,893 --> 01:20:58,038
I'm pretty sure the last number is 6.

905
01:20:58,048 --> 01:21:03,078
Mr. Mayor, you want to press the button?
Or does my man Damien have to do it.

906
01:21:03,078 --> 01:21:05,369
- Go for it man.
- Give it a push.

907
01:21:07,463 --> 01:21:10,483
Stop! Stop! Enough!

908
01:21:11,493 --> 01:21:15,586
What the hell happened out there?
You had a direct order.

909
01:21:15,627 --> 01:21:16,867
You played me
just like you played my father.

910
01:21:16,877 --> 01:21:20,834
Yeah, and your empathy made you soft,
just like your father.

911
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:23,021
I have to make the
tough decision for the city.

912
01:21:23,032 --> 01:21:25,177
And I sent this bomb in there

913
01:21:25,292 --> 01:21:28,166
to get rid of it's problems.

914
01:21:28,312 --> 01:21:31,405
Come on. You know it.

915
01:21:32,415 --> 01:21:34,456
They're no better than animals.

916
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,663
Animals? Who's animals?
Men who struggled to survive?

917
01:21:38,663 --> 01:21:42,860
Or men who will destoy a whole community,
underprivileged women and children?

918
01:21:45,057 --> 01:21:51,243
As a Mayor, I have to do what's best
for all the people of the city.

919
01:21:51,243 --> 01:21:53,191
- The hardworking ones...
- You mean the rich ones?

920
01:21:53,222 --> 01:21:55,367
The ones that contribute.

921
01:21:55,378 --> 01:21:59,481
The ones that are sick and tired
of that cesspool.

922
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:02,668
Cesspool?
You need to wake up my man.

923
01:22:02,678 --> 01:22:06,594
- The people are rising up.
- And the people...

924
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:11,843
Check this out.
They're sick of you.

925
01:22:23,423 --> 01:22:26,401
Catch it on the news in about 5 minutes.

926
01:22:28,703 --> 01:22:32,827
(LAUGHING)

927
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:45,438
The Mayor of Detroit was arrested today
after a compromising video posted online

928
01:22:45,449 --> 01:22:49,406
appeared to show him plotting an attack
on Brick Mansions residence.

929
01:22:49,417 --> 01:22:51,666
(MAYOR ON THE TAPE)
"And I sent this bomb in there."

930
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:54,821
The demolition of walls that divide
the city from the Brick Mansions project

931
01:22:54,832 --> 01:22:56,665
will begin next month.

932
01:22:56,748 --> 01:22:58,727
With no date set for new election,

933
01:22:58,727 --> 01:23:02,851
the acting Mayor announced plans to reopen
schools, hospitals and police stations...

934
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:45,778
Up, up, up.
That was really good.

935
01:23:45,778 --> 01:23:47,881
- (HONKING)
- Go, go, go.

936
01:23:50,818 --> 01:23:52,922
(WHISTLING)

937
01:23:53,067 --> 01:23:56,254
- Yeah man.
- Yo, Sheriff. What a surprise.

938
01:23:56,265 --> 01:23:58,337
- No more crime to fight around here?
- Yeah.

939
01:23:58,358 --> 01:24:03,284
Well, I see you shared your share of the reward money
very responsibly.

940
01:24:03,284 --> 01:24:04,460
I didn't buy this.
Tremaine gave it to me.

941
01:24:04,502 --> 01:24:05,408
No way.

942
01:24:05,408 --> 01:24:07,418
Yeah, he didn't think it
was right for his image

943
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,532
with the whole
From the People campaign.

944
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:12,813
- Guys got my vote.
- We're gonna need it.

945
01:24:12,844 --> 01:24:15,895
What about you partner?
I see you still fighting the good fight.

946
01:24:15,906 --> 01:24:19,019
- Only with Lola.
- Lino.

947
01:24:20,102 --> 01:24:23,195
I gotta go, you're making
me uncomfortable.

948
01:24:23,195 --> 01:24:25,341
- Easy partner.
- He's just jealous.

949
01:24:25,351 --> 01:24:28,465
- You guys.
- Hey, on three.

950
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:31,527
Three.
