1
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,932
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

2
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,703
<i>Those words had been dancing
around my head all night.</i>

3
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:58,080
<i>I mean, it's Vegas lore, that phrase.</i>

4
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:02,286
<i>Just ask any of the old-time pit bosses,
they'll know.</i>

5
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:09,962
<i>It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's
who was first credited with the line.</i>

6
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,699
<i>He would shout it every time
he dealt blackjack.</i>

7
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,258
<i>That was over 40 years ago,
and the words still catch.</i>

8
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,361
<i>Winner, winner, chicken dinner. There it is!</i>

9
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,838
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

10
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,442
<i>Yeah, try it.</i>

11
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,705
<i>I had heard it at least 14 times that night.</i>

12
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,941
<i>I couldn't lose.</i>

13
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,120
<i>First of all, what I was doing wasn't illegal.</i>

14
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:39,452
<i>There were certain institutions and people
that frowned upon it,</i>

15
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,720
<i>but it's legal.</i>

16
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,591
<i>And not everyone can do it.</i>

17
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,857
<i>Just those with gifted minds.</i>

18
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,997
<i>I have a gifted mind.</i>

19
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,129
<i>That's what got me into all this mess.</i>

20
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:56,732
<i>I was counting cards
and I was up over $640,000.</i>

21
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,603
<i>All right!
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.</i>

22
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,444
<i>- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens again.</i>

23
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,519
<i>Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.</i>

24
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,610
<i>We used hand signals, too.</i>

25
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,882
<i>Folded arms, the table's hot.</i>

26
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,450
<i>A touch to the eye, we need to talk.</i>

27
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:20,325
<i>And a hand running through
perfect flowing hair meant only one thing.</i>

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,661
<i>Get out. Now.</i>

29
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,005
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."</i>

30
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:49,121
Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke.

31
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,933
Premed.

32
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,465
4.0 GPA.

33
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,634
44 MCATs.

34
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,536
<i>President, American Legion Math League.</i>

35
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:24,013
TA to Professors Wilkins and Sanders.

36
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,382
<i>Both of whom are friends of mine,
and who wrote glowing recommendations.</i>

37
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,513
<i>And you're accepted early into school here
at Harvard Med,</i>

38
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,558
pending graduation from MIT.
It's very impressive.

39
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,626
Thank you.

40
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,958
<i>The Robinson Scholarship
is comprehensive, as you know.</i>

41
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,500
It's a free ride.
And free rides don't come easy.

42
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,590
Absolutely.

43
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:47,799
<i>We have 76 applicants this year,
only one of whom will get the scholarship</i>

44
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,502
and most of whom have résumés
just as impressive as yours.

45
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,605
Right.

46
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,375
Professor Phillips?

47
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:00,585
Some kids grow up
wanting to play for the Red Sox.

48
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:04,645
<i>You know, some grow up wanting to be,
I don't know, a fireman.</i>

49
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:10,151
<i>I grew up... Well, really,
I just wanted to come here to Harvard Med.</i>

50
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:16,861
<i>And now that I've gotten accepted,
it seems to only come down to the money.</i>

51
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,028
Which I don't really have.

52
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:26,037
<i>So, what I'm trying to say</i>

53
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:30,479
<i>is that I really, really need this scholarship.</i>

54
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,915
Did you rehearse that?

55
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,388
<i>Yeah. Like, 14 times in front of the mirror.</i>

56
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,426
<i>Unfortunately,
desire doesn't figure into this much.</i>

57
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,665
The Robinson is going
to go to someone who

58
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,431
dazzles.

59
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:56,064
Somebody who just jumps off the page.

60
00:07:56,609 --> 00:08:00,978
<i>Oh, well, then, I'm also involved
in a science competition.</i>

61
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,809
We're building a robotic wheel

62
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:07,113
that can navigate itself
using a proprietary GPS system.

63
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,321
<i>Well, I'm designing the system. So...</i>

64
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,550
Right.

65
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:16,493
<i>Ben, last year,
the Robinson went to Hyum Jae Wook,</i>

66
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,565
a Korean immigrant who has only one leg.

67
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,763
<i>Well, I have both my legs.</i>

68
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,998
<i>Well, have you considered
cutting one of them off?</i>

69
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,865
That was a joke.

70
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,777
<i>Ben, it's all about the essay.</i>

71
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,871
You need to really explain to us
what makes you special.

72
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:39,315
What life experience separates you
from all the rest.

73
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,911
Life experience.

74
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,718
<i>What can you tell me, Ben,</i>

75
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,452
that's going to dazzle me?

76
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,309
I'm so sorry I'm late.

77
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:16,684
<i>- Where is your jacket?
- Oh, I got it. I got it. It's right here.</i>

78
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:20,350
This is no way for the new
assistant manager to come to work.

79
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,860
Congratulations.
How does $8 an hour sound?

80
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,430
Eight dollars?

81
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:30,800
<i>Wow! Wow. That's great, Warren.
Thank you. Thank you.</i>

82
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,701
<i>You slept with him, didn't you?</i>

83
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,765
<i>- Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
- Yes, you did.</i>

84
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,505
<i>I'll sleep with him, too,
and I'll get $8 an hour.</i>

85
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,741
<i>So Palmer finishes up his lecture, right?
And I say to him,</i>

86
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,580
<i>"Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need
at least 14 capacitance probes</i>

87
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,780
<i>"to get the kind of results
that you're looking for," okay?</i>

88
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,825
<i>So then he says to me, "Miles,
don't you think that's a little excessive?"</i>

89
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:59,023
<i>And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up
in front of the entire class and I say,</i>

90
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:02,396
"You can never have
enough capacitance probes."

91
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:08,302
<i>Oh, my God.
What the hell is wrong with you?</i>

92
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,140
<i>Oh, nothing.</i>

93
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,744
<i>I hope nothing. You just got promoted, man.
You should be happy.</i>

94
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:19,978
<i>I just gotta write this essay for the
Robinson Scholarship, and I have nothing.</i>

95
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,116
<i>And the reason that I have nothing
is'cause, well, I've done nothing.</i>

96
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,920
<i>- Oh, give me a break, Ben.
- What?</i>

97
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,756
You have everything.

98
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:34,622
<i>You blow me out of the water,
and I'm a cerebral stud. Is that nothing?</i>

99
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:35,996
<i>Yeah, well, it doesn't dazzle.</i>

100
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,366
<i>Hey. It dazzles me, mister.</i>

101
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,403
<i>You know, ever since I was 16,
I crushed exams.</i>

102
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,874
I took on extracurriculars.
I showed up early.

103
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,878
I even sat up at the front and I stayed late.

104
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,948
<i>Man, I gave up everything.</i>

105
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,716
<i>You know, I gave up fun. I gave up sex.</i>

106
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,479
I don't think you gave up sex.

107
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,817
<i>- Okay. Maybe not sex.
- Yeah, you didn't give up sex.</i>

108
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,617
<i>All right, all right. Not sex, but...</i>

109
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,715
It just annoys me that the one thing

110
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,761
that is stopping me
from going to Harvard Med is money.

111
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:08,095
<i>You know, tuition fees and living expenses
alone cost over $300,000.</i>

112
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,993
<i>$300,000.</i>

113
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:14,402
It's outrageous. It's astronomically high.
I get that.

114
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,409
<i>You know, I just thought
there was more to life than just money.</i>

115
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,974
<i>Well, look at the bright side,</i>

116
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,645
I just saved a bunch of money
on my car insurance.

117
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,056
Thank you.

118
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,925
<i>- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thanks, Mom.</i>

119
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,332
<i>Thank you, love. Kisses.</i>

120
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,665
Make a wish.

121
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,068
- Make a wish.
- Okay.

122
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,407
Bravo.

123
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,840
<i>Congratulations, Benjamin.</i>

124
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,742
Did you know Miles did the frosting on that?
You see that?

125
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:58,010
It took me five minutes
to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...

126
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:01,109
<i>Where the next number is 21.
Now you're slipping, Cam.</i>

127
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,744
<i>Cam, you owe another six bucks.</i>

128
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,482
<i>No, no. I didn't eat any of the Buffalo wings.</i>

129
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,058
<i>Oh, really? That's great.
Well, we're not doing it that way.</i>

130
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,423
We're just dividing equally.
So let's say you pay.

131
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,554
<i>I got it, all right?
No, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.</i>

132
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,862
It's your birthday.
You're as broke-ass as I am.

133
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,903
I just wish now
I had eaten some of those wings.

134
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,371
<i>So, I nailed the specs on the 2.09 last night,</i>

135
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,841
after 19 cups of coffee.

136
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,970
- Check it out.
- You are kidding. You're kidding!

137
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,240
<i>This is good. Miles, this is good.</i>

138
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:36,583
<i>Yeah, well, it better be'cause this is what
we've been working for since we got here.</i>

139
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,020
This is called destiny.

140
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,921
<i>You know, there is the... Thank you.</i>

141
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:43,688
There is the possibility that
we might not actually win this thing.

142
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:47,197
<i>Oh, yeah?
Bite your tongue! Bite your damn tongue!</i>

143
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,597
<i>Look, guys,</i>

144
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:56,333
<i>we don't date, we don't travel,
we don't have any money.</i>

145
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:01,002
The only thing that we do have
is the 2.09 Competition.

146
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,449
<i>If we can't even win that, what's the point?</i>

147
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,954
<i>Hey, hey. Look at this!</i>

148
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,149
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

149
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,457
We suck.

150
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,068
<i>Your father would be so proud of you, Ben.</i>

151
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:30,867
Yeah.

152
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:35,246
Do you remember anything about him?

153
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:40,015
Not really. Maybe when he shaved?

154
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,252
<i>Yeah, I think I watched him shave.</i>

155
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,254
<i>So, what are your plans
for the rest of the night?</i>

156
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,091
I don't know. I'll probably just go back
and work on that essay.

157
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,166
<i>Ben, you're working too hard.</i>

158
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:58,965
<i>Between the job and school and the 2.09,
you've had no time for just yourself.</i>

159
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,871
<i>You have to squeeze in
a little time for fun, Ben.</i>

160
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:07,002
You only turn 21 once.
And it goes by very fast.

161
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,342
Okay. All right.

162
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,310
<i>- Good night.
- All right, good night.</i>

163
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,285
- Don't come home before 3:00.
- All right.

164
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,353
All right.

165
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,056
<i>Now, who can explain Newton's method
and how you use it?</i>

166
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,058
You can use it to solve nonlinear equations.

167
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:35,395
<i>That's impressive. That's really good.
I mean, I'm very impressed by that,</i>

168
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,999
especially since my class
is called Nonlinear Equations.

169
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,337
<i>All right, now somebody tell me something
I don't already know.</i>

170
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,575
Anyone?

171
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,243
Bueller. Anyone? Bueller.

172
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,479
Newton stole it.

173
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,582
- I'm sorry?
- Newton stole it.

174
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,861
Joseph Raphson published
this same method 50 years earlier.

175
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,899
<i>And if the start value is too far removed
from true zero, then it fails.</i>

176
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:06,797
<i>- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Ben. Ben Campbell.</i>

177
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,930
Ben.

178
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,873
So Ben Campbell suggests
that Joseph Raphson

179
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,671
was the original author of this method.

180
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,871
<i>Well, if that's the case,
then why didn't he get any credit?</i>

181
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,211
<i>Well, for one thing,
Newton had a better publicist.</i>

182
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,682
<i>And for another, after 1700,
we know very little about Raphson</i>

183
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:26,349
other than the fact that he discovered the
Kabbalah about 300 years before Madonna.

184
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,655
<i>All right, now, let's give Ben a chance
for some extra credit, shall we?</i>

185
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:34,165
<i>We're gonna call this
the game show host problem, all right?</i>

186
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,291
<i>Ben, suppose you're on a game show.</i>

187
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,894
<i>And you are given a chance to choose
from three different doors, all right?</i>

188
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:44,908
<i>Now, behind one of the doors is a new car.
Behind the other two, goats.</i>

189
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,410
<i>Which door would you choose, Ben?</i>

190
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:48,870
Door number one?

191
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,778
Door number one.
Ben chooses door number one.

192
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,874
<i>All right, now, the game show host,</i>

193
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,954
<i>who, by the way,
knows what's behind all the other doors,</i>

194
00:15:56,055 --> 00:16:00,253
decides to open another door.
Let's say he chooses door number three.

195
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:04,260
Behind which sits a goat. Now...

196
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,160
<i>Ben, game show host comes up to you.</i>

197
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,665
<i>He says, "Ben, do you want to stay
with door number one</i>

198
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,098
"or go with door number two?"

199
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:13,660
<i>Now, is it in your interest
to switch your choice?</i>

200
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,864
<i>- Yeah.
- Well, wait.</i>

201
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,068
<i>Remember, the host knows where the car is</i>

202
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,611
so how do you know
he's not playing a trick on you?

203
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,580
Trying to use reverse psychology
to get you to pick a goat?

204
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:27,914
<i>Well, I wouldn't really care.
I mean, my answer's based on statistics.</i>

205
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,988
Based on variable change.

206
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,522
Variable change?
But he just asked you a simple question.

207
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,889
<i>Yeah, which changed everything.</i>

208
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,526
Enlighten us.

209
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,894
<i>Well, when I was originally
asked to choose a door,</i>

210
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,458
I had a 33.3º/º chance of choosing right.

211
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,667
<i>But after he opens one of the doors
and then re-offers me the choice,</i>

212
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,972
it's now 66.7º/º if I choose to switch.

213
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:58,778
<i>So, yeah, I'll take door number two,
and thank you for that extra 33.3º/º.</i>

214
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,513
Exactly.

215
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:03,815
<i>People, remember,</i>

216
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:08,154
<i>if you don't know which door to open,
always account for variable change.</i>

217
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,353
<i>Now, see, most people
wouldn't take the switch</i>

218
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,954
<i>out of paranoia, fear, emotions.</i>

219
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,967
<i>But Mr. Campbell, he kept emotions aside</i>

220
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:23,899
and let simple math get his ass
into a brand-new car!

221
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,271
Which is better than that goat
you've been driving around campus.

222
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,437
<i>All right, everybody.</i>

223
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,946
That's the end of the day.
Thank you very much.

224
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,607
Your graded papers are down here
at the end.

225
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,242
You can pick them up on your way out.

226
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,324
I am invincible.

227
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,763
<i>Guys, Jill Taylor, 10 o'clock.</i>

228
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,387
Man. That's brutal.

229
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,493
<i>You know,
you should just ask her out, man.</i>

230
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,087
It's not like she's a rocket scientist
or anything.

231
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,791
<i>Oh, wait, she is.</i>

232
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,959
<i>Well, why don't you ask her?</i>

233
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,731
Because I'm already dating someone.

234
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,631
<i>Yeah, your right hand doesn't count, Miles.</i>

235
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:34,041
It does the way I use it.
It does the way I use it.

236
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,740
<i>Hey, you know what?
Maybe I don't even want to go out with her.</i>

237
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,250
<i>Yeah, that's funny.</i>

238
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,188
<i>You know, you say
you want a life experience, right?</i>

239
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,894
<i>Well, I'd say getting down with that
would definitely qualify.</i>

240
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,893
Cam!

241
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,587
Boy genius.

242
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,515
You have to follow me now.

243
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,587
- Excuse me?
- You have to follow me now.

244
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,790
Come on.

245
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,171
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

246
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,052
Our honored guest.

247
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,857
<i>- How you doing, Ben?
- I'm okay.</i>

248
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,727
- You ever been in this room before?
- Yeah.

249
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,831
Organic Chemistry in my freshman year.

250
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,427
<i>- How'd you do?
- Well, I got an A.</i>

251
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,602
<i>- Professor Rosa...
- Micky, please.</i>

252
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,611
Is there a problem with my paper?

253
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,911
<i>Well, you found a more efficient method
for finding true zero than Isaac Newton</i>

254
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:22,646
<i>and that, my friend, is not so much of
a problem as it is a major ass-kicking.</i>

255
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:27,748
<i>Although Newton has been dead for over
250 years, so it wasn't exactly a fair fight.</i>

256
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,220
<i>So, is this some kind of a math club?</i>

257
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,160
<i>Don't be rude, people.</i>

258
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,860
- Kianna.
- Fisher.

259
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,561
- Choi.
- Jill.

260
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,504
- You ever studied blackjack?
- No.

261
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,038
<i>No, really? Well, it's really simple, actually.</i>

262
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,239
You play against the dealer.

263
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,507
You're given two cards.

264
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,882
Face cards are worth 10 points.

265
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,046
The closest to 21 wins.

266
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:01,020
<i>If you go over, you lose.
If the dealer goes over, they lose.</i>

267
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,362
It's the most popular card game
in the world.

268
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,692
It's a game with memory.

269
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,494
<i>Cards drawn are the past,
ones to come are future.</i>

270
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,331
<i>And the best part, it's beatable.</i>

271
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,801
Are you talking about counting cards?

272
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:21,504
<i>No. I'm talking about getting very very rich.</i>

273
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:27,174
<i>You count cards, right? All of you?</i>

274
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,776
<i>As a team, yes.</i>

275
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,545
- When?
- Weekends. And Christian holidays.

276
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,155
<i>- Where?
- Vegas, baby.</i>

277
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,956
<i>So, why are you telling me?</i>

278
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,897
<i>Well, let's just say a spot opened up
on our roster.</i>

279
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,026
How?

280
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,728
Jimmy got a job at Google.

281
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,275
<i>- Jimmy got a job at Google?
- Yeah, it's catchy, I know.</i>

282
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,206
<i>Well, if you're making so much money
at this, then why did he take it?</i>

283
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,611
<i>Ben, I said Google, not Sizzler.</i>

284
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,711
Yeah... This is crazy.

285
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,514
<i>No, Ben. This is profitable.</i>

286
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,054
<i>Yeah, I can't do it. So, I'm sorry.</i>

287
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,096
<i>- Come on, Ben. It'll be fun.
- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun.</i>

288
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,755
<i>No, it's not that. It's...</i>

289
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:18,802
<i>I just got a promotion at my job,
so it's kind of not a good time for me.</i>

290
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,371
We pay better.

291
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,801
<i>Look, I can't just go to Vegas on weekends.</i>

292
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,538
<i>Why not? MIT's on cruise control for you,
you've already gotten into Harvard Med.</i>

293
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,807
<i>I mean, what do you have to worry about?</i>

294
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:33,976
- How did you know that?
- I like to take an interest in my students.

295
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:39,615
<i>Well, I'm also really involved
in the science competition.</i>

296
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,221
<i>You know, the 2.09 Competition?</i>

297
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,426
<i>Wait, no.
I'm building a car that drives by itself.</i>

298
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,364
<i>Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing
with my friends for over a year,</i>

299
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,493
so it's kind of important.

300
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:55,437
<i>Ben, let the car drive by itself.</i>

301
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:03,637
<i>Listen, you not only have a gifted mind,
but you're also composed.</i>

302
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:08,374
You don't give in to your emotions.
You think logically.

303
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,656
<i>Ben, you were born for this.</i>

304
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,855
You'll have more fun
than you've ever had in your entire life.

305
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,360
It's perfect.

306
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:23,066
Thank you. But I'm really not the right guy.

307
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,569
So I'm sorry.

308
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,570
Ben.

309
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,313
I hope this little conversation
we just had will remain private.

310
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,111
<i>- No, of...
- No.</i>

311
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,378
<i>You're one of my favorite new students,</i>

312
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,717
<i>and I'd hate to lose you,
if you know what I mean.</i>

313
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,628
- I'm just not sure it's me.
- Ýt's boring.

314
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,565
It's boxy. It's blue. How is that not you?

315
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,863
<i>So, how much is this thing gonna run me?</i>

316
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:04,169
<i>Oh, well, let's see, the belt's $49.95,
minus 15º/º.</i>

317
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,938
The jacket's $589.99.

318
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:10,606
<i>The pants, $285.99, minus 10º/º for both.</i>

319
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:14,981
<i>Unfortunately, the shirt's not on sale,
but I can knock off 5º/º from the $69.99.</i>

320
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,213
<i>The shoes were just marked down
from $155,</i>

321
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:22,885
<i>so you're looking at $1,042.68.</i>

322
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,361
I'm pretty good with numbers.

323
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,695
- Yeah.
- I guess so.

324
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,101
<i>Yeah, so let me know
when I can ring that up for you guys.</i>

325
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:35,154
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

326
00:24:35,189 --> 00:24:36,102
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.

327
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,437
Hey.

328
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,241
Hey.

329
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,387
<i>- Could you help me?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.</i>

330
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,521
I'm looking for a tie.

331
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:58,028
<i>Oh, well, we're having a 15º/º sale
on the ties.</i>

332
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,756
<i>And if you want,
I could probably get you an additional 10º/º</i>

333
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,893
with my employee discount.

334
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,505
<i>- This one's nice.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.</i>

335
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:15,206
<i>This one has actually been treated with
our patented Nano-Tex fabric protection,</i>

336
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:19,374
<i>you know, to repel liquids and stains.</i>

337
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:24,012
<i>- Well, that's really functional.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty functional.</i>

338
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,657
Face me. Stay still.

339
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,060
<i>Despite being tempted
by the Nano-Tex repellant,</i>

340
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:37,725
<i>I'm actually not here for a tie, Ben.</i>

341
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,932
I came to see you.

342
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:44,435
You did?

343
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,042
Blackjack's a great game.

344
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:49,773
<i>No, look, it's easy to learn</i>

345
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,681
and there's really not as much strategy to it
as people think.

346
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,876
<i>I grew up on it, actually.</i>

347
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,423
- You grew up on it?
- Yeah.

348
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,757
<i>Every night after dinner,
my father and I would play.</i>

349
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:07,487
<i>I knew basic strategy
before I was, like, nine years old.</i>

350
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,093
<i>If I won, he'd take me out for ice cream.</i>

351
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,067
And what if he won?

352
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,696
He'd still take me out for ice cream.

353
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:20,141
<i>Oh, yeah. Sure, yeah, he's your dad.</i>

354
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,512
<i>Ben, you should feel the thrill</i>

355
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:29,714
of winning more money
than you can possibly imagine.

356
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,957
I think you should come to Vegas.

357
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:42,466
'Cause I'm guessing that you could
probably use a break from this place.

358
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,400
I can't.

359
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,607
I'm sorry.

360
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,144
I just can't.

361
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,714
<i>Okay. If you change your mind,
you know where we meet.</i>

362
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:01,578
Yeah.

363
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,219
You're welcome any time.

364
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:12,094
<i>You know,
I think the best thing about Vegas</i>

365
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,265
is you can become anyone you want.

366
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:45,990
- What's the count?
- Plus 9.

367
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:47,064
- No.
- Plus 11.

368
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,154
No.

369
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:51,299
<i>- Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago.
- Don't call me "dude."</i>

370
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:52,802
- Plus 9?
- You're just following Jill.

371
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,067
<i>People, please. We had a total of 76 cards
that came out of the deck.</i>

372
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,301
Twenty-three were high cards
with a value of minus one.

373
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,503
<i>Seventeen were neutral with no value at all,</i>

374
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,341
and the rest were low cards
with a value of plus one.

375
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,075
- How could you lose the count?
- Plus 13.

376
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,112
The count. It's plus 13.

377
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,683
Yes.

378
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,452
Pull up a chair.

379
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,228
Stop.

380
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,769
- What is it?
- Plus 12. Eggs.

381
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,842
<i>Twelve eggs in a carton.</i>

382
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,236
- Now what?
- Plus 9.

383
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:35,403
<i>Cats have nine lives.</i>

384
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:36,480
Cat.

385
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,314
<i>Sweet 16.</i>

386
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,677
<i>Every card had a value.</i>

387
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:45,882
<i>A high card, minus one.
A low card, plus one.</i>

388
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,480
<i>The rest, zero.</i>

389
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,857
Plus 13. Plus 8. Plus 9. Plus 12.

390
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,665
<i>I was studying all day, every day.</i>

391
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:59,226
<i>But it wasn't physics, chemistry
and engineering. I was back to simple math,</i>

392
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:02,397
<i>used in ways I could never have imagined.</i>

393
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,172
<i>The team had a system.</i>

394
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,945
<i>And to go unnoticed,
we created a whole new language.</i>

395
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,310
<i>Words were numbers,
and numbers were words.</i>

396
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,053
- Plus 17.
- Magazine.

397
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,178
- Plus 6.
- Gun.

398
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,085
- Plus 15.
- Paycheck.

399
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,686
Plus 12.

400
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,885
Is this chemistry review?

401
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,290
- Plus 14.
- Ring.

402
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,526
- Plus 16.
- Sweet.

403
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,000
Use it in a sentence.

404
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,367
<i>Man, that sugar's sweet.</i>

405
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,569
<i>Because I knew the count,
I knew which cards were left in the deck.</i>

406
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,201
<i>That's how I knew what to bet.</i>

407
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,007
You're doing great.

408
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:49,081
<i>Micky, I just want to let you know
that I'm only doing this for medical school,</i>

409
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,212
<i>which is $300,000.</i>

410
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:54,985
<i>I mean, if I can get anything close to that,
then I'm done.</i>

411
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,525
<i>Well, in the first place, Ben,
it's not "if," it's "when."</i>

412
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,292
<i>And second of all,
I get it. I completely understand.</i>

413
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,027
- You do?
- Yeah. It's a means to an end.

414
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,400
<i>Look, they've got this new computer
software that reads people's faces,</i>

415
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,872
so who knows how long this gig's
gonna last for any of us?

416
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,704
What if we get caught?

417
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,871
<i>Our system keeps us under the radar,
you'll see.</i>

418
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,642
<i>Anyway, counting cards isn't illegal.</i>

419
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:24,011
<i>- So, there's no danger in it at all?
- No, Ben, it's safe. Very safe.</i>

420
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:30,292
You think you can beat the system?

421
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:35,063
<i>This is the system, beating you back.</i>

422
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,964
<i>You wanna count cards,
you do it in Atlantic City.</i>

423
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,371
<i>- Get him up.
- Come on, kid.</i>

424
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,034
Count to five.

425
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,841
- Count to five!
- What?

426
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:54,585
<i>Count to five so I know you don't have
brain damage, you can go home.</i>

427
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,812
Start with one.

428
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,514
<i>One, two, three, four, five.</i>

429
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:02,821
<i>Good. Now, stop counting.</i>

430
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:07,725
Let's go.

431
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,870
<i>You're crazy,
everybody knows to split eights.</i>

432
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:15,030
<i>My grandmother splits eights.</i>

433
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,699
Not against a 10. It's a sucker play.

434
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,436
<i>Look, you're choosing to play two hands</i>

435
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,069
<i>against the highest up card
a dealer can have, right?</i>

436
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,205
<i>Against a five or a six, it'd be fine.</i>

437
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,374
<i>Against a 10 or an ace, it's a sucker play.</i>

438
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,112
<i>Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right?
Jill's right. All right?</i>

439
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,518
<i>Choi, why don't you explain to Ben
how we do?</i>

440
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:32,988
<i>Oh, all right.</i>

441
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,527
<i>So, our team is divided
into two kinds of players,</i>

442
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,357
<i>spotters and big players, right?</i>

443
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:41,921
<i>So if you think that this table
is the casino floor,</i>

444
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,832
then salt and pepper shakers
are your spotters.

445
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,735
Spotters are just sitting
at the various blackjack tables

446
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,173
and they're betting the table minimum.
They never fluctuate their bet.

447
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:55,269
That's right. Spotters never raise the bet
or play any kind of progressive system.

448
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,110
<i>That's how we stay under the radar,
and that's why we never get caught.</i>

449
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:01,276
<i>Exactly. Okay, they're just sitting
at the table, betting the table min,</i>

450
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,946
and they're keeping the count
waiting for one of these decks to get hot.

451
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,784
<i>Right. And then when one of the decks
gets hot,</i>

452
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,381
the spotter at that table signals
in the big player.

453
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,927
<i>This... Mustard.
Give me the mustard, honey. Please.</i>

454
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,088
<i>Well, I'm always the mustard, so...</i>

455
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:17,361
<i>When I get the signal for the hot deck,
I stumble over like some drunk rich kid,</i>

456
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:21,370
<i>or some zoned out dot-com millionaire,
and I throw down big money.</i>

457
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:24,168
So the big player bets big
and still keeps the count.

458
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,470
<i>When the deck cools, he cashes in.</i>

459
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,067
It's not as easy as it sounds.

460
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,612
<i>Oh, yeah, it's not, you know,</i>

461
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,342
<i>because if Grey Poupon over here
ever loses the count,</i>

462
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:35,283
it's up to his table's spotter
to give him the signal to get out.

463
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:37,980
<i>- And you know the signals, right?
- Yeah.</i>

464
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,280
Show us.

465
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,789
<i>Okay, what's this?</i>

466
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,292
- The deck's hot.
- Right.

467
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,259
We need to talk.

468
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,925
The deck's cooling.

469
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,194
And get out. Get out now.

470
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:57,000
Good. I think he's gonna be ready
for our little trial run tomorrow.

471
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,972
There's a trial run?

472
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,374
- Where?
- You'll find out.

473
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,525
Hey.

474
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,014
- You Ben?
- Yeah.

475
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,683
Follow me.

476
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:26,224
This way.

477
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,866
<i>Go, go. You go.</i>

478
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,852
No more bet. No more bet.

479
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,887
<i>Come on, money.</i>

480
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,794
<i>Today, 14.</i>

481
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,662
Whose side are you on?

482
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,203
Sixteen.

483
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:15,404
<i>Thank you. Sorry, gentlemen.</i>

484
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:21,178
<i>So, Henry, did I tell you I read
about this place in a magazine?</i>

485
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:33,653
- You wanna put that money down?
- Yeah. $300.

486
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,025
$300.

487
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,469
$300.

488
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:49,212
<i>You bet, sir?</i>

489
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,344
Thanks.

490
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,166
<i>Winner, winner, chicken dinner.</i>

491
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:18,240
<i>"Winner, winner, chicken dinner." All right.</i>

492
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:22,574
Nice.

493
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,015
<i>Can I get another drink, please?</i>

494
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,617
Thank you.

495
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,222
What the hell are you doing?

496
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:38,454
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything! Get off me!

497
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,190
<i>Get off, I haven't done anything!</i>

498
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:43,927
Please. Please let go.

499
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,832
- What's the count?
- Please don't hurt me.

500
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:48,303
<i>- I said, what's the count?
- Look, I haven't even done anything!</i>

501
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,964
What's the count?

502
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,068
Plus 18.

503
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,908
<i>Oh, you've gotta be kidding.</i>

504
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,178
<i>Congratulations, Ben.</i>

505
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,516
<i>Sorry, we had to make sure
you'd keep the count under pressure.</i>

506
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,385
Welcome to the team.

507
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,086
We didn't mean it.

508
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:12,128
<i>It's okay, Campbell, I cried inside that bag.</i>

509
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:23,701
Fisher and Jimmy
have always been the big players.

510
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,106
I want you to take Jimmy's place.

511
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,643
I've never done this.

512
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,974
I know that and I understand.

513
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,209
<i>But I don't trust the girls,
and Choi is, well, Choi.</i>

514
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:35,478
<i>Look, I've been teaching
for more than 14 years,</i>

515
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,383
and I've never had a student
as impressive as you.

516
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,718
Your brain is like a goddamn Pentium chip.

517
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:42,349
You're gonna do great.
You know how I know that?

518
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,293
'Cause you remind me of myself
25 years ago.

519
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:47,690
You in?

520
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:52,300
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.
- Good. Good.</i>

521
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,401
<i>There's one more thing, Ben,
and this is important.</i>

522
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:02,007
<i>We're counting cards, we're not gambling.</i>

523
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:05,340
We're following a specific set of rules
and playing a system.

524
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,438
Right.

525
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,575
<i>I've seen how crazy
it can get at those tables,</i>

526
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,587
<i>and sometimes, people lose control.</i>

527
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,184
They give in to their emotions.

528
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,892
You will not.

529
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,653
You understand?

530
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,822
Yeah.

531
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,734
Get some rest.

532
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,394
<i>- Some rest?
- Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow.</i>

533
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:31,134
Tomorrow? I have a Quantitative Literacy
paper due Tuesday.

534
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:33,668
<i>- No, you don't.
- I don't?</i>

535
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,643
<i>No, I spoke to Professor O'Reilly.</i>

536
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,907
<i>I told him you were helping me
with a special assignment,</i>

537
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:40,643
<i>and he understood, so he gave you an A.</i>

538
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:45,344
<i>You see, Ben, amazing things
can happen from the inside.</i>

539
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:48,050
You'll get a call about details later.

540
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,228
<i>So did the girls go on ahead, huh?</i>

541
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,662
<i>Oh, yeah. They got a lot more bags
to check, you know?</i>

542
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:55,823
Okay.

543
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,834
<i>Well, wait for us by security
'cause Ben and I are gonna hit the head.</i>

544
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:00,028
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

545
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:02,469
<i>No, I really think you should go.
It's a long flight.</i>

546
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:05,440
<i>- No, I'm okay.
- We're going to the bathroom.</i>

547
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,308
<i>Honestly, I really don't have to go.</i>

548
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:12,814
<i>- I don't care what you have to do.
- Look, I really don't have to...</i>

549
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:13,975
Please just shut up.

550
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,315
<i>Why are you looking over there?
Look, I don't...</i>

551
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,513
I don't care. Shut up. Get in here.

552
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,817
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

553
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,256
- Pull down your pants.
- What?

554
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:26,991
Don't ask questions.

555
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,827
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?

556
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:35,269
<i>You want me to do it?
'Cause, I swear to God, I will.</i>

557
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,101
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.

558
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,338
<i>And we're not about
to have them confiscate $250,000.</i>

559
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,175
<i>$250,000?</i>

560
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:48,244
- No. Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.

561
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,548
You really suck at not asking questions.

562
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,589
What's a donkey boy?

563
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:01,494
<i>- Step forward, sir.
- Thanks.</i>

564
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,663
<i>- In the basket, please.
- There's a table when you get to the line.</i>

565
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,399
<i>Act casual, think casual, be casual.</i>

566
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:12,203
<i>Remove your keys, any metal objects.
Laptops out, please.</i>

567
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:13,640
Thank you.

568
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:19,208
<i>If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag,
please show them to us now.</i>

569
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,375
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

570
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,669
Your boarding pass.

571
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:05,719
Sir?

572
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,071
You forgot your bag.

573
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,877
Thanks.

574
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,128
<i>Nice going, Campbell.</i>

575
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:29,899
<i>Hey, Ben.
Basic strategy says you should hit that.</i>

576
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:45,115
<i>Burt, Moishe, Vladimir,</i>

577
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:48,419
<i>Mona, Miss Sommers,
your new identities are on the bar.</i>

578
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,516
So glad you could make it.

579
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,626
Vladimir Stupnitsky?

580
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,028
Yeah. Your dad's a diplomat
with the Russian consulate.

581
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,292
<i>You live in Washington, D.C.</i>

582
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,166
<i>Your hobbies are backgammon, chess
and long walks on the beach.</i>

583
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,534
- I don't like my name.
- Why not?

584
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,734
"Sierra Sommers." Do I look like a Sierra?

585
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:08,038
<i>Well, you have a lot of clever outfits.
You'll figure it out.</i>

586
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,308
Just pretend you don't speak English.
Then you don't have to change your hair.

587
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,612
<i>You know, I thought this was legal.
Why do we have to use fake names?</i>

588
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:16,948
<i>Well, it is. We not only use fake names,
we use disguises.</i>

589
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,750
It's for the benefit of the dealers
to make sure you're old enough to gamble

590
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:22,121
and it allows everyone to be different people
in different casinos.

591
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:26,253
<i>Hey! You steal the Bible, you go to hell.
That's the way it works.</i>

592
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,062
Like I'm not going already.

593
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,257
<i>Yeah. All right. Now, listen.</i>

594
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:32,301
<i>Ben, this is for you.
All the casinos have cameras in the ceiling.</i>

595
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:33,768
They're called "eyes in the sky."

596
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,806
<i>For their benefit, order a tonic water
and lime and act a little drunk,</i>

597
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:39,398
<i>and at all times, you don't know each other.</i>

598
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,810
<i>Let me say that one more time,
you do not know each other ever.</i>

599
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,141
And what's our motto?

600
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,184
- Don't get caught counting.
- Don't get caught counting.

601
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,980
Thank you very much.

602
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,613
How come you don't play?

603
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:55,920
<i>Oh, I did. I played for a long time
and I was the best. But I'm retired now.</i>

604
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,927
<i>Take my advice, Ben, it's always best
to go out when you're on top.</i>

605
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,621
Welcome to Vegas.

606
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,000
No more bets.

607
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:13,940
<i>All right, here we go.
Big money, now. Big money.</i>

608
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:17,104
<i>Let me tell you about blackjack, honey.
You ever hear of basic strategy?</i>

609
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,944
<i>Oh, see,
now that sounds really complicated.</i>

610
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,211
- I'm Sierra Sommers from Charleston.
- Pleasure.

611
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,981
Here to double my family's inheritance.

612
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,247
I don't know.

613
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,478
<i>$10,000.</i>

614
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,381
<i>Changing $10,000.</i>

615
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,348
Sweet. Too sweet.

616
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:17,632
<i>Eight. The count's still plus 16.</i>

617
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,211
<i>Ten. That's minus one.</i>

618
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:23,172
<i>Count's plus 15.</i>

619
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:27,175
<i>Eight. Still plus 15.</i>

620
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,720
<i>Nine. Plus 15.</i>

621
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:35,351
<i>Five. The count's 16.</i>

622
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,757
<i>Eights. Split eights.</i>

623
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,086
Can I split those?

624
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:43,189
<i>- Sir, please don't touch the cards.
- I'm sorry.</i>

625
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,932
<i>Jack. Count's plus 15.</i>

626
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,679
<i>Ten. Plus 14.</i>

627
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:07,755
<i>King. Nine. Plus 13.</i>

628
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:16,255
<i>Jack. Plus 12.</i>

629
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:19,326
<i>Nine. Still plus 12.</i>

630
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:21,168
<i>Blackjack.</i>

631
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,383
Monkey! Monkey!

632
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,385
- So what's a monkey?
- Face card.

633
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:13,888
<i>All right, face card.
Come on, monkey. Okay, monkey.</i>

634
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:18,587
Monkey!

635
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,361
<i>Monkey! Come on, give us a monkey!</i>

636
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:23,627
<i>Monkey! Come on, monkey,
monkey, monkey! Monkey.</i>

637
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,224
Monkey! Monkey!

638
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,403
<i>All right, all right.</i>

639
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:36,139
<i>Oh, God.</i>

640
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:38,805
I need to quit.

641
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,780
<i>Could I color up, please?</i>

642
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,064
Nice undies.

643
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:38,631
- What's this?
- It's last night's take.

644
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:40,573
We split it five ways.

645
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,511
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

646
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:49,244
<i>Yeah, it was fun.</i>

647
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:51,153
- You were good.
- Really?

648
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:54,690
Yeah. Came in quick off the count.
You acted the part.

649
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:58,750
<i>You weren't afraid to play big, and
you got out when you were supposed to.</i>

650
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:03,055
And you made more money than Fisher.

651
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,893
<i>I was pretty nervous, actually.</i>

652
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:09,972
<i>You know, but after a while,
it felt kind of easy.</i>

653
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:13,299
Not for everyone.

654
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,537
<i>Yeah, it's just simple math.</i>

655
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:19,014
Good.
We can do some serious damage with you.

656
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,753
Here's the thing I told Micky.

657
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:31,355
<i>You know, I'm only really doing this
just to pay for medical school.</i>

658
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:34,123
<i>You know, $300,000 and then I'm out.</i>

659
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,793
That's what they all say.

660
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:43,198
<i>No, really, I mean, I'm just doing this
to pay for Harvard.</i>

661
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,774
It's just a means to an end for me.

662
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:49,111
I believe you.

663
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:50,671
Good.

664
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,951
<i>- Hello?
- We have a team meeting in five minutes.</i>

665
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:06,751
Team meeting.

666
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,458
Hello?

667
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,827
- Hey.
- Hey.

668
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,667
Where's everybody else?

669
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,532
I don't know. Fisher was right behind us.

670
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:20,635
<i>Oh, Fisher, you didn't sleep.</i>

671
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:25,471
- I did. With Ida.
- Ida?

672
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:29,611
She's a dancer. I pulled her out of Sapphire.

673
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:34,590
- And Ida's her dancer name?
- Yeah. After her grandmother.

674
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,092
Where's Kianna?

675
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:38,554
Slots.

676
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:44,028
<i>- Choi, where the hell you been?
- Unattended maid cart, ninth floor.</i>

677
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:47,065
I've been busy this morning.

678
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:51,873
<i>All right, guys, let's get something clear.</i>

679
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:54,205
This is not summer camp
and I'm not your counselor.

680
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:56,711
<i>This is real, world-class
moneymaking business.</i>

681
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,804
<i>Kianna, slots are for losers.</i>

682
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:01,076
<i>Fisher, peelers are stealers.</i>

683
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:02,442
Choi?

684
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:06,916
<i>You made five grand last night,
so would you stop stealing nine-cent pens</i>

685
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:10,823
and everything you can get your hands on
from the maid's cart? It's embarrassing.

686
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:14,988
<i>But, Fisher,
what the hell were you up to last night?</i>

687
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:16,389
What?

688
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,492
<i>Three separate occasions, the spotters
let you know that the deck was cooling,</i>

689
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:20,797
but you kept on anyway.

690
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:22,496
You either lost the count
or you lost your head.

691
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:24,540
<i>In either case,
I don't wanna see it happen again.</i>

692
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,506
<i>Jill, nice disguise last night.</i>

693
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:31,274
<i>And Ben, good work. You came out
of that chute like a pro. Keep it up.</i>

694
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:33,338
Beginner's luck.

695
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,442
<i>Hey, Fisher. Win like a man, lose like a man.</i>

696
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,079
<i>Micky, I didn't play
into a cold deck three times.</i>

697
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:40,520
You know what's worse than a loser?

698
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:43,855
Someone who won't admit
he played it wrong.

699
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,825
Take it up with Ida.

700
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,258
Who's Ida?

701
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,757
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

702
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,858
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.

703
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,787
There goes that paycheck.

704
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:32,640
<i>- Money plays.
- Money plays, up to the limit.</i>

705
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,813
How's she doing?

706
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,512
<i>Oh, that doesn't matter, man.</i>

707
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:42,517
<i>The way I see it, yesterday's history,
tomorrow's a mystery.</i>

708
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:45,417
<i>It's all what you do in the moment, baby.</i>

709
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,626
Just lost another property.

710
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:04,105
<i>- Who is it this time, Caesars or the Mirage?
- Caesars.</i>

711
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,768
That was a 14-year account.

712
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:12,047
<i>- They opted to go with the new software.
- I know, Terry, I know.</i>

713
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:17,642
<i>Hey, Cole. We got absolutely murdered in
pits four and five the last couple of nights.</i>

714
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,552
<i>Okay, Clark, I'll take a look at the tape.</i>

715
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:24,193
<i>By the way, you wanna lose the cigarette?</i>

716
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:28,654
<i>There's no smoking in here, you know that.</i>

717
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,328
I appreciate it.

718
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:44,981
<i>End of an era, my friend.</i>

719
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:56,055
Ben. Time for school.

720
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:02,057
I seem to keep waking up to you.

721
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:03,826
Don't get used to it.

722
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,310
I'm glad you came over this morning.

723
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:29,425
<i>- I have something I wanna give you.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

724
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,920
I want you to have this.

725
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:35,893
What's this?

726
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,335
That's a lot of money.

727
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,469
I've been saving for a long time.
It's for medical school.

728
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:51,911
<i>I know it won't pay the whole way,
but it should help.</i>

729
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:56,083
<i>Ma, I can't take this.</i>

730
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:58,713
This is your money.
You worked hard for this.

731
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:03,623
<i>For precisely this reason. I wanna help pay
for med school, Dr. Campbell.</i>

732
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,664
<i>Well, you know what? You don't have to.</i>

733
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:15,204
'Cause I got the Robinson Scholarship.

734
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:18,497
<i>Yep, they're gonna pay the whole way.</i>

735
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:22,842
<i>- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, because I wanted it to be a surprise.</i>

736
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:25,141
<i>And actually, I just found out today.</i>

737
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:28,411
<i>I can't believe it! Oh, my God!</i>

738
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,983
This is amazing. I am so proud of you.

739
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:39,990
<i>- I knew the hard work would pay off.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

740
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:44,590
<i>So, listen, you keep this, all right?
It's yours.</i>

741
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:25,334
What are you doing?

742
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:30,311
I'm just jumping up and down on my bed.

743
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:36,414
What? You never did that
when you were a kid?

744
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:39,010
<i>- No. Not really, never.
- No.</i>

745
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,149
Right.

746
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:45,587
All right.

747
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:48,129
<i>So where were you this weekend?
I tried calling you, like, 15 times.</i>

748
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:51,894
<i>Oh, yeah? I ended up
having to go to New Hampshire</i>

749
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:54,401
to help my cousin move.

750
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,438
You didn't bring your cell phone?

751
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:59,269
Your cell? Your phone?
You didn't bring that?

752
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:04,677
<i>No, I forgot it. I ended up leaving it here.
So, you know.</i>

753
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:07,147
<i>Yeah, well, you missed
a hell of a dorm party on Saturday.</i>

754
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,478
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

755
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:10,815
We almost had a girl there.

756
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,352
- Republik?
- Yes.

757
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:17,884
Let's do it!

758
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:28,794
She is an eight.

759
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:33,575
- No way. She's a 7.649.
- I was rounding up.

760
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,645
<i>Hey, I thought we agreed
we weren't gonna round up anymore.</i>

761
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,270
That's right.

762
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:43,084
<i>But if we win the 2.09, I'm asking her out.</i>

763
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:54,160
<i>Wait. Ben? Ben, you only owe eight bucks.</i>

764
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,570
Hey. Can I get you a beer?

765
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:08,273
- Sure.
- Yeah? Okay.

766
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,040
Excuse me. Can I get two Bud Lights?

767
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:16,577
Hey.

768
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:23,289
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

769
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,883
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

770
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:27,059
Thank you.

771
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,602
Are those your friends over there?

772
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:43,339
<i>No. No, I've never seen them before
in my life.</i>

773
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:47,510
Could you just excuse me for one second?

774
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:52,879
<i>Guys, I'm serious.
What are you doing? You're staring.</i>

775
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:54,047
<i>Yeah, we know.</i>

776
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:55,181
<i>Yeah, well, can you not?</i>

777
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,054
<i>I think it's gonna freak her out a bit,
don't you think?</i>

778
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,789
<i>Yeah, I got a feeling we're a little
more freaked out than she is right now.</i>

779
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:02,558
So how do you know her?

780
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:06,157
<i>Did you, like, take some self-help seminar
or something?</i>

781
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:08,294
What?

782
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:12,366
<i>- Jedi mind trick, huh?
- Jedi mind trick. Like that Luke.</i>

783
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:15,634
<i>- You will drink beer.
- Right. Right, right.</i>

784
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:18,839
<i>There is a fortune on the table now,
and it's all up to my dad.</i>

785
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,540
It's getting ridiculous.

786
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:24,211
<i>He actually needs to stop the table play,
track down my uncle and take a loan.</i>

787
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,787
<i>- No, are you serious?
- Yeah.</i>

788
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:27,879
<i>They let him, and he does.</i>

789
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:31,525
<i>He ends up with, like, two 19s and two 20s.</i>

790
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,686
The dealer turns over a 17.

791
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,526
It's soft. He needs to take another card.

792
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,999
No. Don't say a four. Is it a four?

793
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,900
<i>- It's a four, yeah.
- It's a four. My God.</i>

794
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,537
Not a great Christmas that year.

795
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:51,535
<i>So, what does he think about what you do?
Does he know?</i>

796
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:54,276
<i>Oh, no, he's long gone, Ben.</i>

797
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,650
<i>My dad's gone, too.</i>

798
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:15,901
<i>So, you know, when you came into the store
to ask me to join the team,</i>

799
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:18,400
was that because...

800
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:20,002
What?

801
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,676
<i>Well, you know,
was it because Micky asked you to?</i>

802
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:29,944
<i>Look, we've had three classes together.</i>

803
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:33,922
You gave that presentation
on combinatorial algorithms

804
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,854
that nobody understood.

805
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:41,191
<i>You're the smartest person in every single
one of those classes, Ben.</i>

806
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:45,461
That is why you're on the team.
And that's why I came into the store.

807
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:48,603
<i>No, no, not so much...</i>

808
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,572
<i>- Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry.
- No. It's fine.</i>

809
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:54,108
- It's not a problem.
- I don't know why I just did that.

810
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,438
- Don't apologize.
- Are you sure?

811
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,105
<i>Yes. Shit, this is my stop.</i>

812
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:00,614
<i>- You're getting off here?
- Yeah, I've gotta get off.</i>

813
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,413
<i>But, really, don't worry about it.</i>

814
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:07,283
<i>I don't know,
it's just'cause we've been drinking, and...</i>

815
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,881
<i>It's just we're on a team, we work together.</i>

816
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:12,426
- I get it.
- Just don't feel bad about this.

817
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:15,053
Okay. Sure. Bye.

818
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:38,915
<i>My world was flashing by
at a million miles a minute.</i>

819
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,225
<i>I had saved over $100,000.</i>

820
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:46,452
<i>Only $200,000 to go.</i>

821
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:51,599
<i>But there was still one thing
I couldn't get off my mind.</i>

822
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:03,706
<i>The moment we left campus,</i>

823
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:06,077
<i>the concept of vectors and formulas</i>

824
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:08,878
<i>were replaced with counting,
shuffle tracking</i>

825
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:12,148
<i>knowing when to hit
and knowing when to color out.</i>

826
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:14,982
<i>I was becoming a pro on all levels.</i>

827
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,255
<i>I made more money in one trip to Vegas</i>

828
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:22,764
<i>than I would have in 5 years, 9 months,
12 days and 6 hours at J. Press Menswear.</i>
