1
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,047
2306, please.

2
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,919
Hello, honey.
How you doing?

3
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,863
Good.
What did he say?

4
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:50,494
Uh-huh. Is he still there?
How long ago did he leave?

5
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,472
Uh-huh. I'm stopping here,
then I got a little meeting,

6
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,169
and then I'll...
I would if I could.

7
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,371
As soon as I can.
Let me get off and l...

8
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:04,678
let me get off and I prom...
I promise you it'll be okay.

9
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:10,547
A bunch of bullshit.
Waste a good man's time.

10
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,833
Hi, could I speak
to Dr. Lowenstein, please?

11
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,528
It's rather important.
Could you get him for me?

12
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,299
Bunch of bullshit trying to make
a living on these deadbeat leads.

13
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,806
I swear to God, Shel,
I'm on a sit today...

14
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,140
Hello, Mrs. Swoboda,
this is Dave Moss.

15
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,203
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

16
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,046
Now on the Rio Rancho Estates,
we've had a situation just come up.

17
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,711
The president of our company
is in town just one day,

18
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,085
- And he has certain parcels...
- Doctor...

19
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:46,182
well, could you get...
what do you mean?

20
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,989
He's not there?
I have to speak to him.

21
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,998
Yes, it is fairly urgent.
Mr. Levene.

22
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:57,332
No, I can't be reached.
I'll get back to him.

23
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,598
He has certain parcels...
certain choice parcels

24
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,163
which he's given me
a hold on for the next 48 hours.

25
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,177
What would be the best time to get
you and your husband together?

26
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:10,239
Say, tonight, at 10:00,
or tomorrow at 8:00?

27
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,774
Okay.

28
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:15,446
Okay, what would be
the best time to do that?

29
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,815
Look, you sent in the...
no, no, listen to me now...

30
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,623
I've got 48 hours
to make you a lot of money.

31
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,364
Well, when will he be home?
Fine, I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

32
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,598
They don't give you the leads,
they don't give you the support,

33
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,504
- They don't give you dick.
- Yeah.

34
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,566
Then they're yanking us in
on some sales conference.

35
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,738
When's the last time anybody
learned a goddamn thing?

36
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,180
All it does is some jerk
shoots his mouth off.

37
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:48,284
I swear to God, Shel, I got half a mind
to go across the street.

38
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,845
I got half a mind to go
with you if they'd take me.

39
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:55,087
You never know... I was talking
to Jerry Graff last week.

40
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,323
I got to call
these deadbeats back.

41
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,628
I can't make a goddamn
dollar with these leads,

42
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,534
and you're killing my ass
on the street.

43
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,936
- I'm sorry you aren't happy here.
- That's cute,

44
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,497
but you're running this office
like a bunch of bullshit.

45
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,702
You're on an override...
you make money, we make money.

46
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,804
- I'd like you to make more money.
- Then don't go waste my time.

47
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,577
- A sales conference?
- The strategy comes from downtown.

48
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,915
Oh, the strategy?
The strategy?

49
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,011
- Well, I think I'll pass.
- I wouldn't.

50
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,955
- Why is that?
- When you come, then you'll see.

51
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:28,084
- Shelly.
- John.

52
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,220
Are you ready
to do or die tonight?

53
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,230
Oh yeah,
always ready, John.

54
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,630
Always ready, John.
Now, one thing...

55
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,669
we were talking about the leads.
We got some new ones?

56
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,000
That's what we're going
to talk about at the meeting.

57
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,506
We are? Because I'm running
into a bit of a snag.

58
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,337
Yes, I've seen
your sales figures.

59
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,468
That's the leads.
You give me a better lead...

60
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,604
That's what we're going
to be talking about.

61
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,477
I'm in a bind...
personal problems.

62
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,346
- I could use a leg up.
- After the meeting.

63
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:54,581
- I hear the new Glengarry leads...
- After the meeting, Shel.

64
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,588
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hello, John.

65
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,216
- Wet out there tonight.
- Huh?

66
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:03,786
- Wet out there tonight.
- Uh-huh.

67
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,024
- Maybe it'll break the heat.
- Yeah.

68
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,866
Al, give me a quick J&B, huh?
Double.

69
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,702
Cutty, Al.

70
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,302
- They say...
- Huh?

71
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,146
they say it was so hot
downtown this afternoon,

72
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,711
grown men on the street corner
were going up to cops

73
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,484
begging the cops
to shoot them.

74
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:36,358
They say you should not drink
alcohol when it's so hot.

75
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:40,695
- Who says that?
- Something I read.

76
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:44,100
For they say
it dehydrates you.

77
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,003
They say
you should drink water,

78
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,237
but I subscribe to the law
of contrary public opinion.

79
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:55,670
If everyone thinks one thing,
then I say bet the other way.

80
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,884
Added to which,
you know they're wrong.

81
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,419
That's what I'm saying.

82
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:08,049
- Slow tonight.
- Oh, yeah.

83
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,220
Well, I guess
everybody's staying home.

84
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,594
If my daughter calls,
anybody calls,

85
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:16,226
I'm over at the office.
Thanks.

86
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,664
I had a woman
in White Plains on the hook...

87
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,706
five units, Mountain View...
what happens?

88
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,605
She has to check
with her lawyer.

89
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,236
- You let her check with her lawyer?
- What could I do?

90
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,837
- I dunno.
- Shelly.

91
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,007
- Huh?
- Who's the guy?

92
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,017
Couldn't tell you.

93
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,782
I don't like the whole thing,
because all I need is a lead.

94
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,585
- They won't give out...
- Uh-huh.

95
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,251
The rich get richer,
that's the law of the land.

96
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,488
Who belongs
to the BM...?

97
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,599
It is 7:30.

98
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,830
So who is that?

99
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,840
And where is
Mr. Roma?

100
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,569
Well, I'm not a leash,
so I don't know, do I?

101
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:35,704
Let me have
your attention for a moment.

102
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:39,012
You're talking about what?
You're talking about...

103
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,445
bitching about
that sale you shot,

104
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,717
some son of a bitch
don't want to buy land,

105
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,155
somebody don't want
what you're selling,

106
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,160
some broad you're
trying to screw, so forth.

107
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,287
Let's talk
about something important.

108
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,990
- Are they all here?
- All but one.

109
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,020
I'm going anyway.

110
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,626
Let's talk
about something important.

111
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,068
Put that coffee down.

112
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,645
Coffee's for closers only.

113
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,549
You think
I'm fucking with you?

114
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,784
I am not fucking with you.

115
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,718
I'm here from downtown.

116
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,350
I'm here
from Mitch and Murray.

117
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,590
And I'm here
on a mission of mercy.

118
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,993
- Your name's Levene?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,871
You call yourself a salesman,
you son of a bitch?

120
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,671
I don't got to listen
to this shit.

121
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,008
You certainly don't, 'cause
the good news is, you're fired.

122
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,546
The bad news is you've got...
all of you've got...

123
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,609
just one week
to regain your jobs,

124
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:51,145
starting with tonight...
starting with tonight's sit.

125
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:57,025
Oh, have I got
your attention now?

126
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,959
Good...

127
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,127
'cause we're adding
a little something

128
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,864
to this month's
sales contest.

129
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,998
As you all know, first prize
is a Cadillac Eldorado.

130
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,100
Anybody want to see
second prize?

131
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,613
Second prize is
a set of steak knives.

132
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,481
Third prize is you're fired.

133
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,918
Do you get the picture?
Are you laughing now?

134
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:31,396
You got leads. Mitch and Murray
paid good money.

135
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,625
Get their names
to sell them.

136
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,724
You can't close
the leads you're given,

137
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,463
you can't close shit,
you are shit!

138
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:42,064
Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it,
'cause you are going out!

139
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,599
- The leads are weak.
- The leads are weak?

140
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,408
The fucking leads are weak?
You're weak.

141
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,449
I've been
in this business 15 years.

142
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,814
- What's your name?
- Fuck you...

143
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,410
that's my name!
You know why, mister?

144
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,615
Because you drove a Hyundai
to get here tonight,

145
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,593
I drove an $80,000 BMW.
That's my name.

146
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,926
And your name
is "You're wanting."

147
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,165
You can't play in the man's game?
You can't close them?

148
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,606
Then go home and tell your wife
your troubles.

149
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,441
Because only one thing
counts in this life...

150
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,880
get them to sign
on the line which is dotted!

151
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,884
You hear me,
you fucking faggots?

152
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,560
"A-B-C."

153
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,621
A... Always,
B... Be, C... Closing.

154
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,633
Always Be Closing.

155
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,364
"Always Be Closing."

156
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,102
"A-l-D-A."

157
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,870
"Attention, Interest,
Decision, Action."

158
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,411
Attention...
Do I have your attention?

159
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,606
Interest...
Are you interested?

160
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,945
I know you are,
because it's fuck or walk.

161
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,008
You close
or you hit the bricks.

162
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:04,318
Decision... Have you made
your decision for Christ?

163
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:09,054
And Action.
"A-l-D-A."

164
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,426
Get out there...
you got the prospects coming in.

165
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,658
You think they came in
to get out of the rain?

166
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,133
A guy don't walk on the lot
lest he wants to buy.

167
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,501
They're sitting out there
waiting to give you their money.

168
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,597
Are you gonna take it?

169
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,802
Are you man enough
to take it?

170
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,242
Crap.

171
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,219
What's the problem, pal?
You... Moss.

172
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,755
You're such a hero,
you're so rich,

173
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:41,088
how come you're here wasting
your time with a bunch of bums?

174
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,729
You see this watch?

175
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:52,133
- You see this watch?
- Yeah.

176
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,401
That watch costs
more than your car.

177
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:59,535
I made $9 70,000 last year.
How much you make?

178
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:06,951
You see, pal... that's who I am,
and you're nothing.

179
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,887
Nice guy?
I don't give a shit.

180
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,949
Good father? Fuck you...
go home and play with your kids.

181
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:19,555
You want to work here...
close!

182
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,897
You think this is abuse?

183
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,027
You think this is abuse,
you cocksucker?

184
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,767
You can't take this, how can you
take the abuse you get on a sit?

185
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:33,334
You don't like it, leave.

186
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,715
I can go out there tonight...
the materials you got...

187
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:42,880
make myself $15,000.
Tonight... in two hours!

188
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,786
Can you?

189
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,554
Can you?

190
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,522
Go and do likewise.
"A-l-D-A."

191
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,193
Get mad, you son of a bitches.
Get mad!

192
00:13:56,268 --> 00:14:00,204
You know what it takes
to sell real estate?

193
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,969
It takes brass balls
to sell real estate.

194
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,309
Go and do likewise,
gents.

195
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,783
The money's out there...
you pick it up, it's yours,

196
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,151
you don't,
I got no sympathy for you.

197
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,053
You want to go out
on those sits tonight and close...

198
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,852
close... it's yours.

199
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,086
Not, you're gonna be
shining my shoes.

200
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,891
And you know
what you'll be saying.

201
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,592
Bunch of losers
sitting around in a bar,

202
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,762
"Oh yeah, I used to be a salesman.
It's a tough racket."

203
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,913
These are the new leads.

204
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,042
These are
the Glengarry leads.

205
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:50,817
And to you, they're gold.
And you don't get them.

206
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,654
Why?

207
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,719
Because to give them to you
is just throwing them away.

208
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,168
They're for closers.

209
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,504
I'd wish you good luck,

210
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,841
but you wouldn't know what
to do with it if you got it.

211
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:23,013
And to answer your question, pal...
"Why am I here?"

212
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,057
I came here because
Mitch and Murray asked me to.

213
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,821
They asked me for a favor.
I said, "The real favor...

214
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,886
follow my advice
and fire your fucking ass,

215
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,455
because a loser
is a loser."

216
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,070
Bunch of fucking nonsense...

217
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,843
treat people like that.

218
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,577
The fuck is he going
to get off?

219
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:59,021
- Mickey Mouse sales conference.
- He didn't mean it.

220
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,958
I'm sure he didn't mean it about
trimming down the sales quota.

221
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,222
Where is Roma?
Where the hell is Mr. Ricky Roma?

222
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,662
All the while we got to sit here,
eat this nonsense?

223
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,860
Hello? Mr. Levene.
How's she doing?

224
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,926
Uh-huh, yeah.
Is she awake?

225
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,529
Oh, the doctor came by.
What did he say?

226
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,167
Uh-huh.
I can't come in tonight.

227
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:21,007
I think... I know she is.
I know that she is.

228
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,948
I've gotta go out. Will you please
tell her when she wakes?

229
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:28,976
I've got to go out.
Tell her I'll call her from the road.

230
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,646
Thank you.

231
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,052
Gentlemen,
you heard the man.

232
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,925
What is this in aid of?

233
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,090
- As of tonight...
- What is this? Excuse me.

234
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,326
What it's in aid of
is that Mitch and Murray...

235
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,131
Fuck Mitch and Murray!
I'm doing my job,

236
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,001
I got to put up
with this childishness?

237
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,937
I don't make the rules.
I'm paid to run the office.

238
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,374
You don't like the rules, Dave?
There's the door!

239
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:57,873
Two lead cards for tonight,
two lead cards for tomorrow.

240
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,679
As you heard,
end of the month,

241
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,845
top salesman on the board
gets the Eldorado.

242
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,047
- Next man down the...
- What about the good leads?

243
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,489
- The leads I've given you.
- But these leads are shit.

244
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,389
They're old...
I've seen that name 100 times.

245
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,624
- The leads are assigned randomly.
- What about the new leads?

246
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,494
The new leads...
the Glengarry leads.

247
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,897
I've got them.
I'm going to hang onto them.

248
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,061
And they'll be
assigned to closers,

249
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,503
based on the sales volume,
first to Roma.

250
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,506
- Where is Roma?
- Don't worry about Roma.

251
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,201
He'll get his leads,
you've got yours.

252
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,403
He's top name on the board,
so he don't have to be here?

253
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,969
That's correct!
And as the hour is waning,

254
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,881
I suggest you... those of you
who are interested

255
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,748
in a continuing job with
this organization, get to work.

256
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,845
That's garbage.
Bullshit.

257
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,617
- Thank you for your attention.
- Bullshit!

258
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,820
How am I supposed to close these?
Look at this.

259
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,864
I've had this guy before.
I've been to his house twice.

260
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:49,662
l... I can't...
I can't close this stuff.

261
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,406
Shelly, how am I
supposed to...

262
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,136
They're going
to bounce me out of a job.

263
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:09,746
Hello, Mr. Palermo?
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:13,189
Mr. Speice?
Mr. Robert Speice?

265
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,227
Yeah,
this is George Aaronow.

266
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,389
I'm with Rio.
I spoke with your wife earlier.

267
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,992
I'm the vice president of Rio Rancho
Properties in Furman, Arizona.

268
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:28,301
Yes. I'm calling from the airport,
and consulting my map,

269
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,603
I see that you and your wife
live near the airport.

270
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,702
I have some rather...
rather unusual,

271
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,009
rather good information
on the property...

272
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:40,484
Hello? Hello, this is
Sheldon Levene.

273
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,180
Please listen closely...
I only have a moment or so.

274
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,850
I can speak only
to a Mrs. Nyborg.

275
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:50,884
Oh, this is Mrs. Nyborg.
Please listen closely, Mrs. Nyborg.

276
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,660
I'm calling from Consolidated
Properties of Arizona.

277
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:58,464
Our computer has chosen you
from all of the many thousands

278
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,370
who write in requesting
information on our properties.

279
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,432
Now by federal law,
as you probably know,

280
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,741
the prize must be awarded to you
even if you are not engaged

281
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,804
in our land
development plan.

282
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:13,511
The only stipulation, of course,
is that you and your husband

283
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,748
must sign at the same time
for the receipt of your prize.

284
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:21,225
Now, I will be in the area
tonight, possibly tomorrow.

285
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,853
What do you think might be
a convenient time to meet

286
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,056
with both you
and your husband?

287
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,759
Of course I'll hold.

288
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,576
- Bunch of fucking nonsense, huh?
- I can't close them.

289
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,174
- Nobody can close 'em.
- They're old.

290
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,446
They're ancient...
a bunch of fucking nonsense.

291
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,818
Get some jerk
to come in here...

292
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,687
Sometimes I think,
"I wonder if I belong in this business."

293
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,125
Send a guy out there...
no support, no confidence.

294
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,857
Then I say,
"Nobody can close 'em."

295
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,456
- Then I look at Roma.
- Roma... fuck Roma.

296
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,592
Had a freak...
a little run of luck.

297
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,103
The leads are garbage.

298
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,264
Then I say,
"Why give him the good leads?

299
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,467
- He doesn't need 'em."
- You going out?

300
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:15,138
Yeah. I have to go out.
I can't make a sit.

301
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,116
- Have you tried?
- Yeah. Something's wrong with me.

302
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,152
What is it?
I can't push through.

303
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,450
Get your coat on.
You're coming out with me.

304
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,615
- Something in me.
- Forget it.

305
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,751
- I try, I try.
- I said forget it, come on.

306
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,091
I can't close 'em.

307
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,361
Life.

308
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,665
I swear to God,
you work all your life...

309
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,833
- Forget it, George.
- Roma, so on...

310
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,308
- So gifted.
- Gifted, my ass!

311
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,938
- The guy gets a string of luck.
- No, no, no.

312
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,709
The thing of it is,
money's tight.

313
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,647
When times are tight,
it don't do no good

314
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,084
to throw around,
"Just go out and sell."

315
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,883
Threaten a man all you want,
you can't whip a dead horse.

316
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,480
- Nope.
- All this garbage...

317
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,048
"Sell 10,000,
you win a Cadillac;

318
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:04,425
you lose, we're gonna fire
your ass"? It's medieval.

319
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,690
- Yes.
- It's wrong.

320
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,231
- Yes.
- Yes it is,

321
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,823
and you know
who's responsible?

322
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,868
- Who?
- You know who it is.

323
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,836
It's Mitch and Murray,
'cause it don't have to be this way.

324
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,930
- No.
- Look at Jerry Graff.

325
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,998
He's clean, he's doing
business for himself,

326
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,236
he's got that list...
with the nurses?

327
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:24,248
You see? That's thinking.
Why take a 10% sales commission?

328
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,285
Why are we giving the rest away?
What are we giving 90% for?

329
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,980
For nothing.
For some jerk in the office,

330
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,387
telling us, "Get out there and close,
go win a Cadillac."

331
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,085
Graff goes out and buys.
He pays top dollar.

332
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,593
- You see?
- Yes.

333
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,631
For the leads... that's thinking.
Now, he's got the leads,

334
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:43,896
he goes in business for himself.
That's what? That's thinking.

335
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,903
Who... who's got
a steady job,

336
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,098
a regular job,
a couple of bucks nobody's touched?

337
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,663
Nurses.

338
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,368
Graff goes and buys
a fucking list of nurses. One grand...

339
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,809
he paid two, I'll eat my hat.
4,000 or 5,000 nurses.

340
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,279
- He's going wild.
- He is?

341
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,579
- Yeah, he's doing very well.
- I heard they were running cold.

342
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,448
- The nurses?
- Yeah.

343
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,683
You hear a lot of things.
He's doing very well.

344
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,621
- With River Oaks?
- River Oaks, Brook Farms.

345
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,388
All that shit. Somebody told me...
you know what he's clearing, himself?

346
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,259
- 14, 15 grand a week.
- Himself?

347
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,664
That's what I'm saying.
Why? He's got the leads.

348
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,794
He's got the good leads.
What are we?

349
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,633
We're sitting
in the shit here. Why?

350
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,537
Because we got to go to them
to get them.

351
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,508
90% of our sales we're paying
to the office for the leads.

352
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:29,013
There's our leads, there's overhead,
phones, a lot of stuff.

353
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,049
What do you need?
A telephone?

354
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:34,279
Some broad to say, "Good morning"?
Nothing. It's the leads.

355
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,651
The whole thing is the leads,
you understand me?

356
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,520
You can't sell to a void...
you got to get a goddamn person.

357
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:42,151
You get a lead, you get
a person... I'll go sell 'em.

358
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,024
Otherwise, what do they want
from my life?

359
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:48,126
Hello, Danny?
Dan, it's Shel Levene.

360
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,226
Yeah, we spoke...
last May I called you.

361
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,500
I was in town from my estate
in Rio Rancho, and...

362
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,302
Arizona.

363
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,605
I wish we could have
gotten together at that time.

364
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:02,477
Danny, that piece of property I had
for you has increased in value...

365
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:07,746
Grace, Grace,
what was that figure? $ 76,000.

366
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,287
Oh, Danny, I wish you could have
been in on it with me.

367
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,949
Look, I'm here overnight...
I have to go home tomorrow,

368
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:16,892
and I thought, after the interest
you showed on the last trip, that...

369
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:20,830
Hold it, Grace. Danny,
I know that you're serious,

370
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,993
and because of that, I am going
to shove my appointments around

371
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,096
and make sure...
oh, gee, I wish that...

372
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:33,137
All right, Danny.
Yeah, all right.

373
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:47,020
Going out tonight,
Shelly?

374
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:52,830
What is this bullshit
with the sales promotion?

375
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,388
It isn't bullshit.
It's the way it is.

376
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,559
You're going to fire
the bottom men on the list?

377
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,035
That's the way it is
and I don't make the rules.

378
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,437
- The rules come from downtown.
- I got a problem here, John.

379
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,998
- I'm closing up the office.
- Come have a drink with me.

380
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:08,341
- I've got to get home.
- Do me the courtesy... five minutes?

381
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,574
I am trying to get home
for two hours.

382
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,641
I got to go home, grab one hour
with my kids, come back here,

383
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,209
see if any of you closed
a contract, take the contract...

384
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,815
- How about one minute?
- What is it?

385
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,950
- I can't close these leads.
- Then move on.

386
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:25,895
Don't jump! Don't jump out
of your manager bag a second.

387
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:30,230
It's just two guys talking,
am I right? We're just talking.

388
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,896
You got the new leads.
If you would give me... just hold on.

389
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,735
The Glengarry leads are to be
assigned only to closers.

390
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,537
Hold on a second.
If you give me the good leads...

391
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,237
You blew the last good one
I gave you.

392
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,973
No, no... hold on,
will you?

393
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,641
I did not blow 'em.
One kicked out. One, I closed.

394
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,616
- You didn't close it.
- Would you listen to me?

395
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:50,485
I closed that cocksucker!
His ex! John, his ex!

396
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,023
I didn't even know he was married.
The judge invalidated it.

397
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:53,989
Shelly...

398
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,619
What was that job, huh?
Bad luck. That's all it was.

399
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,890
I pray you never find it...
it runs in streaks.

400
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:01,865
That's what it's doing,
that's all it does... streaks.

401
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:05,528
I pray that it misses you
and that's all I have to say.

402
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,596
Shit, I've got to eat.
Williamson...

403
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:12,803
Iook at the sheets.
Look at the sheets.

404
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:16,575
198 7, '88, '89...
six months in '89... who's on top?

405
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,115
- Roma.
- Under him?

406
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,947
- Moss.
- Oh, bullshit, John!

407
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,613
April to September it's me...
it's no fucking Moss.

408
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,020
Due respect,
he's an order-taker.

409
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,788
Talk... talks a good game,
but look on the board, it's me.

410
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,022
- Not lately it isn't.
- Not late...

411
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,492
Well, lately...
kiss my ass "lately."

412
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:37,228
You call Murray and you call Mitch...
when we were on Peterson,

413
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,964
who do you think bought the new car?
Call Mitch. The Seville?

414
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,132
He came in here...
"You bought that for me, fella."

415
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:47,110
And out of what? Hey, look at me!
Out of what? Nothing!

416
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,408
Cold calling.
You want to talk about a sale?

417
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,006
You are really
beginning to burn my ass, kid.

418
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:56,417
I can't get a lead, you...
it was skill, John.

419
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,956
It could be working for you...
you want to throw it away.

420
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,219
- It isn't me.
- It's not you...

421
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,818
I wonder who it is.
Who the fuck am I talking to?

422
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:07,661
- I need the leads to sell.
- After the contest. After the 30th.

423
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,962
Bullshit,
"After the contest."

424
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,731
If I'm not on that board by the 30th,
they're going to can my ass.

425
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:19,536
I need those leads
and I need 'em now or I'm out.

426
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:30,451
You're going to miss me.
I swear to you, you will miss me.

427
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,285
Let me tell you
something, Shelly.

428
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,383
I do what I'm hired to do...
you might do the same.

429
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,325
- Jesus.
- Now wait a second!

430
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:42,866
I'm hired to watch the leads,
to marshal my sales force.

431
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,061
I'm given a policy.
My job is to do that.

432
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:47,195
Marshal your sales force?

433
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,934
Anybody falls below
a certain mark, I'm directed.

434
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,976
I'm not permitted
to give them the premium leads.

435
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:56,002
How do they rise
above that mark? With dreck?

436
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,413
With this toilet paper
you're giving me?

437
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,075
You give me
one premium lead...

438
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,846
Do you know what
the premium leads cost?

439
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,184
Do I know what
the premium leads cost?

440
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:05,688
Yeah,
I know what they cost.

441
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,988
I generated the sufficient
dollar revenue to buy them.

442
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,052
But I cannot sell shit!

443
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,690
Jesus. And I've seen
these before, you know.

444
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,700
Christ, I saw these back...
Homestead...

445
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,100
1985, we pitched
these cocksuckers Baywater.

446
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:23,470
They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.
They're broke. They're deadbeats.

447
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:26,476
Just give me some leads that don't
come out of a phone book.

448
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:29,240
You give me something hotter
than that and I can close it.

449
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,509
It's just a streak.
I'm gonna turn it around.

450
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,848
Hey, I need your help.

451
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,821
I can't do it,
Shelly.

452
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,358
John...

453
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:50,094
I'll give you 10%.

454
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,728
- Of what?
- My end... what I close.

455
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:55,739
You give me the premium leads,
you're in for 10%, what I close.

456
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,672
- And what if you don't close?
- I will.

457
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,767
- What if you don't close?
- I will close.

458
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,937
What if you don't,
you understand?

459
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,914
Then I'm fucked. You think you're
the only guy with a family?

460
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,712
- You see what I'm saying?
- John...

461
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,049
I step out and you don't close,
then it's my job.

462
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,088
- Then I'm fucked.
- I will close!

463
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,886
Now, 10% John...
I can get hot, you know that.

464
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,518
- Not lately you can't.
- That's defeatist... fuck it!

465
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,529
Go with me. Get on my side
and let's do something.

466
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:22,259
You want to run this office?
You heard what the man said...

467
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,767
"Attack."
Let's do something.

468
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:29,239
- Huh?
- 20%.

469
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:33,270
- All right.
- And 50 bucks a lead.

470
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,335
- No?
- Oh!

471
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,983
Oh, shit.

472
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:01,735
Listen...
I got to talk to you.

473
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:06,675
Permit me to do this a second.
I'm older than you.

474
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,078
A man acquires a reputation
on the street.

475
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,878
What he does when he's up,
what he does at other times...

476
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:16,148
I said, "10," you said, "No."
You said, "20," I said, "Fine."

477
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:19,622
Now you want to throw
this 50-buck thing in.

478
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:24,560
John, a good deal... has got to be
one where both parties...

479
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,860
Okay, okay, okay, fine...
20%, 50 bucks a lead. It's done.

480
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,832
Let's go out.
We make some money.

481
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,529
I got bills to pay.
I want two sits tonight

482
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,266
and I want the good leads...
the Glengarry leads... two.

483
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,535
Two, John, because
I am going to close 'em both.

484
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,407
It's a long road
with no turning, pally.

485
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:43,345
Huh? Okay.
Now, let's go.

486
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:46,008
I've got to go back
to the office to get 'em.

487
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:49,986
Go on, let's go.
This is what I was saying, John.

488
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,750
All you need, a little boost,
you turn a streak around.

489
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,850
Am I right? Good, huh?
Huh, good?

490
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,361
What?

491
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:01,193
- What?
- Two leads, 100 bucks.

492
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,359
- Now?
- Now, yes. When?

493
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,698
- Shit, John.
- I wish I could.

494
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,466
You fucking asshole.

495
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,805
I don't have it...
I don't...

496
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,208
I'll bring it in the office
in the morning.

497
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,679
- I'll be coming with the sales.
- Nope.

498
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,813
I can't fucking
believe this.

499
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:25,219
All right, here's...

500
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,121
20... 30, and...

501
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:30,753
Jesus, here's the 30.
I'll bring the rest in tomorrow.

502
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,024
We got to do this, huh, pal?
For Christ's sake!

503
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,928
No.

504
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:40,934
- My daughter...
- I can't do it, Shelly.

505
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,065
I got to tell you something.
It wasn't so long ago,

506
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:48,044
I'd pick up the phone
and call Murray... I got your job.

507
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:51,513
"Murray, the kid is burning my ass."
"Shelly, he's gone."

508
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:56,384
You are gone before
I'm back from lunch.

509
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,183
Bought him a trip
to Bermuda once.

510
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,087
- I've got to go.
- All right, hey.

511
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:04,686
Give me... I'll take two more
of the old leads.

512
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,356
- I gave you two today.
- One is a bust-out, John!

513
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,423
- The other ain't home!
- Shelly...

514
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,626
I promise you,
I've been on the phone... I know.

515
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,363
No more leads today...
two per day. You've got yours.

516
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,462
All right.

517
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,939
- All right?
- Sure.

518
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:26,640
We will do that...
other thing.

519
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,516
I guess I left
my wallet in my room.

520
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,688
Deadbeats.
Deadbeats, all of 'em.

521
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:44,462
My mistake.
I shouldn't have took the leads.

522
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,833
- You had to.
- Yeah? Why?

523
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,135
- To get on the...
- To get on the board, yeah.

524
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,300
How am I gonna get on the board
trying to sell a doctor?

525
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,139
Two regular,
two chocolate donuts.

526
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,271
Give me the same thing to go.
And don't try and sell an Indian.

527
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,042
I will never try to sell
an Indian.

528
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,380
These names come up...
you ever get 'em..."Patel"?

529
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:03,420
- You ever get 'em?
- I think I had one once.

530
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,786
You had one,
you'd know it..."Patel."

531
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,518
They keep coming up.
I don't know.

532
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,924
They like to talk to salesmen.
They're lonely.

533
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,724
They like to feel superior...
never bought a fucking thing.

534
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:15,391
I don't know.
Come down the line...

535
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:19,926
doctors, lawyers, Indians...
times are tight. It's tight.

536
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:24,498
Pressure's just too great.
Man can't work all of 'em.

537
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:28,306
You go in the door... I got to close
this fucker or I don't eat lunch,

538
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:32,110
or I don't win a Cadillac.
We work too hard, George.

539
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:39,586
Remember when we were... when we
were selling Glen Ross Farms?

540
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,921
Didn't we sell
a bunch of that?

541
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,154
- They came in...
- They fucked it up.

542
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,219
- They did.
- They killed the goose. And now...

543
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,595
- We're stuck with this...
- Stuck with this fucking shit.

544
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,293
- This shit.
- It's too...

545
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,632
- It is.
- You get a bad month...

546
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:56,140
they put you on this board.
Some contest board.

547
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,675
- It's not right.
- It's not right to the customers.

548
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,041
I know, it's... hey. What did I learn
as a kid on Western?

549
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:07,116
Don't sell a guy one car.
Sell him five cars over 15 years.

550
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,914
- That's right.
- You're goddamn right, it's right.

551
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,956
Guys come in..."Oh, the blah,
blah, blah. I know what I'll do.

552
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:14,423
I'll go out and rob everybody
blind and go to Argentina

553
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,357
'cause nobody ever
thought of this before."

554
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:19,294
So they kill the goose
and the man's worked all his life...

555
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,264
- That's right.
- He's got to cower in his boots...

556
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,425
Boots, yes...

557
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,833
For some fucking "Sell 10,000,
win the steak knives."

558
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,803
- What do you do?
- What can you do?

559
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:30,272
What can you do
if you don't have the leads?

560
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,071
If you do not
have the goddamn leads!

561
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:36,178
Mr. Spannel?
Sheldon Levene.

562
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,272
I was speaking
to your wife earlier?

563
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,214
Come in.

564
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,680
- "Cats and dogs," huh?
- Yeah.

565
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:46,383
Oh, "cats and dogs."

566
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,491
Oh, I see you're
interested in fishing.

567
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:54,258
- Yeah.
- I've fished myself... many years.

568
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,165
Muskee, Wisconsin.
Ooh, a beauty.

569
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,904
- Where's the missus?
- Out at the PTA.

570
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,838
- Ahh.
- What was this in reference...?

571
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:05,967
I spoke to your wife
earlier on the phone.

572
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,944
I called, I'm in town
with Rio Rancho.

573
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:11,209
Yes, I'm sorry. She said you had
some sort of award?

574
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:14,547
Yes, I was speaking to the people
in my sales organization...

575
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:18,385
my representatives in this area...
and Mr. Spannel...

576
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:21,289
your name is Larry.
Mind if I call you Larry?

577
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,056
All right, Larry.
We had a consultant,

578
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,257
and he made me...
he made me an offer.

579
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:31,893
He offered me $230,000
to promote a sales plan...

580
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:36,497
to present investment opportunities
in Rio Rancho to the public.

581
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,839
Well, I said, "Hell,
let me save you the 230,

582
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,005
and pass the savings
along to the investor."

583
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,244
My people immediately said,
"Whoa, how do you do that?

584
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:49,286
How can you present
investment opportunities

585
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,548
without television,
without magazine ads?"

586
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,522
I said, "You take
something this good,

587
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,821
you go to a man...
has invested in the past...

588
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:59,761
you go to him direct and offer
the money to him... rebate.

589
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,959
And don't give it
to this expert."

590
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,427
So you're here
to sell me some land?

591
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,699
No, I wouldn't try
to sell you...

592
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,106
I leave that to the salesmen
and people who want to own land.

593
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,940
I think something
has to be fed,

594
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,947
watered and painted,
but don't invest in it.

595
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,540
That motto has stood me
in good stead.

596
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,813
- Mister...
- Just call me Shelly.

597
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,117
I have never
been afraid of familiarity.

598
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:27,214
I'm walking out the door.
I've got to pick up my wife at the...

599
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,691
Let's take my car.
We'll pick her up together.

600
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,990
Spoke to the little woman
on the phone... can't wait to meet her.

601
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,860
No, we're going
over to our relatives'.

602
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,593
- She didn't say anything about that.
- I'm sure she forgot.

603
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:39,295
- I'm on a plane to Florida...
- I'm sorry if we put you out.

604
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,895
You didn't put me out.
I'm just trying to think, Larry.

605
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,533
You know, that's the only parcel
that I've got.

606
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,339
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go back to the computer,

607
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,574
I'm gonna pull another one, and we're
gonna speak to your relatives, too.

608
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,014
- No, no, no.
- C'mon, you're a busy man, so am I.

609
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,951
My God, I'm in the act
of giving a gift away.

610
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,955
Look, I don't want to buy land.
I don't want to invest in land.

611
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:03,585
I have nothing. She took the call
without my knowledge.

612
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,925
I have no business
that I wish to transact.

613
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,828
I don't want to tell you
how to handle your wife.

614
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:11,733
My wife filled in a form, and we
have been plagued for the last year...

615
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,771
That's the situation
I'm trying to alleviate, Larry.

616
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,636
No, no.
Do you understand?

617
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,707
Thank you. No.

618
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,689
- Roma, man... he don't care.
- He don't care.

619
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:41,198
He's sitting on top of the world.
He's got good leads, good prospects.

620
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,665
- Sales, sales.
- Sales contests.

621
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:46,532
- That's what I'm saying.
- Times turn hard, they bounce you out.

622
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,629
If they bounce you with no
confidence...

623
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,300
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying to you.

624
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,138
If they get you
on a bad beat...

625
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,685
and you got to go out there,
get a new job...

626
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:03,515
- With no...
- With no confidence...

627
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,112
Yes.

628
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:09,421
I'll tell you what the hard part is...
to stop thinking like a goddamn slave.

629
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:12,985
You say the Nazis
in Europe...
"If they came in my door"...

630
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,430
bullshit, the time is now.
What do you do now?

631
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,831
Some guy pissing in your face.
Cocksucker...

632
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,336
wants to break your rice bowl.

633
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,999
Mitch and Murray, fuck you.
What I say... fuck you!

634
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,873
Sitting on the good leads.

635
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,777
George, we're men here.

636
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,376
Yes.

637
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:36,386
And I'll tell you...
I'll tell you what the hard part is.

638
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,048
- What?
- Starting up.

639
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,853
Standing up.
Breaking free of this bullshit,

640
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,623
this enslavement to some guy,
'cause he's got the upper hand.

641
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,334
This is the difference...
listen to me, George.

642
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,563
Now Jerry Graff went
into business for himself.

643
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:59,235
He said, "I'm going on my own."
And he was free, you understand me?

644
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,436
I'll tell you... I'll tell you
what somebody should do.

645
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:07,473
What?

646
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:10,179
Somebody should stand up
and strike back.

647
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,586
Somebody should do something
to them.

648
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,887
- What?
- Something to pay them back.

649
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,790
Someone should hurt them,
Mitch and Murray.

650
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,556
- Somebody should hurt them?
- Yeah.

651
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,494
- How?
- Someone should do something

652
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:22,293
- To hurt them where they live.
- What?

653
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:25,563
Someone should rob the office.
That's what I'm saying.

654
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:29,072
If we were that kind of guy
to hold up the joint and trash it,

655
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,200
it looks like robbery,
we take the leads out of the files

656
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,210
and we go to Jerry Graff.

657
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:38,146
And we take the fucking
Glengarry leads! Huh?

658
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,250
Yeah, Mr. Nyborg? Ah, Mr. Nyborg,
Sheldon Levene.

659
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,916
I was speaking to your wife earlier.
That's right.

660
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,620
I'd like to speak to you
about awarding you your prize.

661
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,686
We're coming to the end
of our fiscal year,

662
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,459
I'd really like to get it
off the books before...

663
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:58,525
yes, the prize
for Consolidated Properties.

664
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,127
The information you requested
on Rio Rancho.

665
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:04,402
Now, I'm in town only for...
well, let me see.

666
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,444
I suppose I could
swing by tonight. Yes. Uh-huh.

667
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,105
When do you think
it might be more convenient?

668
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,741
As I said,
I could swing by tonight...

669
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,308
well, of course,
you speak to your wife.

670
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,320
Grace, I'm gonna need

671
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,948
a first-class seat,
passport, 10,000 in cash,

672
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,288
put that with the negotiable
papers, if you would.

673
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,558
And put me
on the telex hookup... yes?

674
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,122
Well, when do you think
Mrs. Nyborg might be back?

675
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:33,626
All train compartments
smell vaguely of shit.

676
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,901
It gets so you don't
mind it.

677
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:40,137
That's the worst thing
that I can confess.

678
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,805
You know how long it took me
to get there? A long time.

679
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:48,985
When you die you're gonna regret
the things you don't do.

680
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,147
You think you're queer?
I'm gonna tell you something.

681
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,659
We're all queer.
You think you're a thief? So what?

682
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,320
You get befuddled
by a middle-class morality?

683
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,330
Get shut of it.
Shut it out.

684
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:04,494
You cheat on your wife,
you did it. Live with it.

685
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,833
You fuck little girls,
so be it.

686
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:11,671
There's an absolute morality?
Maybe.

687
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,370
And then what?

688
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,972
If you think there is,
go ahead, be that thing.

689
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:21,015
Bad people go to hell?
I don't think so.

690
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,019
You think that,
act that way.

691
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:29,492
A hell exists on earth?
Yes. I won't live in it.

692
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,551
That's me.

693
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:40,135
Did you ever take a dump, made you
feel like you slept for 12 hours?

694
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,866
- Did I...?
- Yes.

695
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,432
- I don't know.
- Or a piss?

696
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,784
Great meals fade
in reflection.

697
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,547
Everything else gains.
Do you know why?

698
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,987
'Cause it's only food.
This shit we put in us,

699
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:02,491
keeps us going...
it's only food.

700
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,059
The great fucks
you may have had,

701
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,064
what do you remember
about them?

702
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:12,193
- What do I remember?
- Yeah.

703
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,733
I don't know.
For me,

704
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,264
I'm saying what it is,
it's probably not the orgasm.

705
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,744
Some broad's forearm
on your neck,

706
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:29,252
something her eyes did.
There was this sound she made.

707
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:33,252
Or it's me in the...
I'm telling you...

708
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:37,260
I'm in bed the next day,
she brought me caf au lait,

709
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,764
gives me a cigarette,
my balls feel like concrete.

710
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,355
Eh?

711
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,800
What I'm saying,
what is our life?

712
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:52,203
Our life is looking forward
or it's looking back.

713
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:56,110
That's it.
That's our life.

714
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,774
Where's the moment?

715
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,256
And what is it
we're so afraid of?

716
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,223
Loss. What else?

717
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:13,423
The bank closes, we get sick,
my wife died on a plane?

718
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:18,096
The stock market collapsed?
What of these things happen?

719
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:21,262
None of them.
We worry anyway. Why?

720
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:24,630
What could we get
for them?

721
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,438
- For them?
- For the leads.

722
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,536
What could we get
for the leads?

723
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:33,982
I don't know. 10 bucks a throw.
15 maybe. I don't know.

724
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,215
For the leads, you're saying?
Say somebody took them,

725
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,417
- Went to Jerry Graff?
- Yeah. How many leads do we have?

726
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,823
The Glengarry?
The premium leads?

727
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,090
I've got to think they've got 500.
Say 500 leads.

728
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:49,428
You're saying a fella could take
those leads and sell them to Graff?

729
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,764
The leads to Graff.
Yes. I was saying... yeah.

730
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:54,429
A guy could take...
like anything else, it seems to me,

731
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:57,030
that is negotiable,
a guy could sell them.

732
00:42:57,107 --> 00:43:00,508
- How do you know he'd buy them?
- Because I worked for him.

733
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:04,275
- You didn't talk to him?
- No. What do you mean?

734
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,441
- Did I talk to him about this?
- Yeah.

735
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,815
Are you just talking about this,
or are we just talking about it?

736
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:11,320
- Just speaking about it.
- Speaking about it as an idea?

737
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:13,481
- Yes.
- We're not actually talking about it.

738
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:16,321
- No.
- Talking about it as a robbery.

739
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:19,157
As a robbery? No.

740
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,829
- Well...
- Hey.

741
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,699
So all this...
you didn't actually call Graff?

742
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,204
- You didn't talk to him?
- Not actually, no.

743
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,537
- You didn't?
- No, not actually.

744
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,201
- Did you?
- What did I say?

745
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,074
- What did you say?
- I said, "Not actually."

746
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:37,306
Fuck you care, George?
We're just talking.

747
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:38,712
- We are?
- Yes.

748
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:42,150
- Because it's a crime.
- Robbery. That's right.

749
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,853
It is a crime.

750
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,360
- It's also very safe.
- You're actually talking about this.

751
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:54,192
- That's right.
- You're going to steal the leads.

752
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:55,697
- Have I said that?
- Are you?

753
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,563
- Did I say that?
- Did you talk to Graff?

754
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,227
- What did I say?
- What did he say?

755
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,100
What did he say?

756
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,401
He'd buy them.

757
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,412
You're gonna steal...

758
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,651
you're gonna steal the Glengarry
leads and sell them to Graff?

759
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:23,750
- Yes.
- What's he gonna pay?

760
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:27,092
He figures there's 500 leads,
let's say 10 bucks apiece,

761
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,759
- That's $2,500 each.
- Each?

762
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,768
- "Each"?
- That's right, George.

763
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,270
- You're saying me?
- No, you and me.

764
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,605
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm saying. $2,500 apiece.

765
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,975
You and me for one night's work,
and a job with Graff

766
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:44,810
- Working the premium leads.
- A job with Graff?

767
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:47,282
- Is that what I said?
- He'd give me a job?

768
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,410
He could take you on.
Yes.

769
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:13,632
Hello?

770
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,111
I was dialing the direct line
to my daughter's room.

771
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,910
Sheldon Levene.
She's in...

772
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:23,544
well, yeah, I'm sure she's asleep.
But... where's the duty nurse?

773
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:28,155
They canceled her...
well, let me talk...

774
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,216
who am I speaking to?

775
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:36,261
I'll have the money there
tomorrow.

776
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,825
It's a big decision,
George.

777
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:42,269
At times a guy
has got to make one.

778
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,432
It's a big decision
and it's a big reward.

779
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:47,841
$2,500 and a job, it's a big reward
for one night's work.

780
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,004
Yes.

781
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,548
Sometimes a guy...

782
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,982
sometimes, a man
if he wants a reward...

783
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,612
That's absolutely right.

784
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,679
He'll do one thing,
one thing on one night.

785
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:04,319
That's absolutely right.
The thing is, it's got to be tonight.

786
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:05,452
What?

787
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,520
What, what?
The leads ain't going to leave?

788
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,793
They bring those leads up,
wave them under your nose,

789
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:12,028
tomorrow they take them downtown,
parcel them out.

790
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,866
A guy wants those leads,
he's gonna have to get them tonight.

791
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,873
Tonight is the thing.
Talk about a chance.

792
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,670
It's when a chance
presents itself.

793
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:21,370
You got to go
in there tonight.

794
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,810
- You.
- I'm sorry?

795
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,575
- You.
- Me?

796
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,707
You have to go in.
You have to get the leads.

797
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,218
- I do?
- It's not something for nothing.

798
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:33,052
I took you in on this.
You have to go. It's your thing.

799
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,284
I've made a deal with Graff.
I can't go in.

800
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,624
I've spoken out on this too much.
I've got a big mouth.

801
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:41,721
"The fucking leads," et cetera,
"the tight-ass company," blah, blah.

802
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,734
- They'll know when you go to Graff.
- What will they know?

803
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,066
That I stole the leads?
I didn't steal the leads.

804
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,901
I'm gonna go to the movies.
Then I'm gonna have a late drink

805
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,134
- At the Como Inn with a friend.
- Dave.

806
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,506
Yes?

807
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:55,670
You want me to break into the office
tonight and steal the leads?

808
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,008
- Yes.
- No.

809
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,672
- Oh, yes, George.
- What does that mean?

810
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:03,209
Listen to this. I have an alibi.
I'm going to the Como Inn.

811
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,017
Why? Why?
The place gets robbed,

812
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,557
they're going to come looking for me.
Why? Because I probably did it.

813
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,059
Let me ask you this...
are you going to turn me in?

814
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,959
What if you don't get caught?

815
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,520
They come to you,
are you going to turn me in?

816
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,624
- Why would they come to me?
- They're going to come to everybody.

817
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,463
- Why would I do it?
- You wouldn't, George.

818
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:20,526
That's why I'm talking to you now.
They come to you,

819
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,401
- Are you going to turn me in?
- No.

820
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,133
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

821
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:29,202
Uh-huh. George...
when they come to me,

822
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,941
if I have to go in there,
and if I get caught...

823
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,848
- They come to me...
- You don't have to go in.

824
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,783
I have to go in, see?
That's something I have to do.

825
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,913
- Why?
- Why?

826
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,581
Are you going to give me $ 7,500?

827
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:42,887
75? I thought we were
splitting five grand.

828
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,952
I lied, all right? Your end is 25,
my end is my own concern.

829
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,998
Now, stick with me here.
If they come to me,

830
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:51,728
I'm caught, they're going to ask me
who were accomplices.

831
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,463
- Me.
- Absolutely.

832
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,834
That's ridiculous.

833
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,737
To the law, you're
an accessory before the fact.

834
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:59,708
- I didn't ask to be.
- Tough luck, because you are.

835
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:02,404
- Because you told me about it?
- That's right.

836
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:05,004
Why are you doing this
to me, Dave?

837
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:07,710
Why are you talking this way to me?
I don't understand.

838
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:11,015
- Why are you doing this at all?
- None of your fucking business.

839
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:12,988
Just in or out?
You tell me.

840
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,580
You're out,
you take the consequences.

841
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,592
- I do?
- That's right.

842
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,628
- And why is that?
- Because you listened.

843
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:20,486
Well, when will
Mrs. Nyborg be back?

844
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,158
You know, I hate to keep
calling you this late, Bruce,

845
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:27,363
but I feel a responsibility,
I must say. When you have...

846
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:32,498
You know, they say,
"You don't buy it, you rent it."

847
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,874
- Huh?
- The thing.

848
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:39,848
You really...
what do you keep?

849
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,715
I mean, you don't keep
anything, really.

850
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:45,550
- No.
- Security.

851
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,216
Things. Things.

852
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:50,692
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

853
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:55,357
It's just... you try
to stave off insecurity.

854
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,831
You can't do it.

855
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,360
- No.
- No. That's what I'm telling you.

856
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:04,703
Stocks, bonds, objects of art,
real estate, what are they?

857
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:08,211
An opportunity.
To what? To make money?

858
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:12,214
Perhaps. To lose money?
Perhaps.

859
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:15,774
To indulge and to learn
about ourselves? Perhaps.

860
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:18,946
So fucking what?
What is it? They're an opportunity.

861
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:21,957
That's all they are.
They're an event.

862
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:25,688
A guy comes to you,
you make a call. You send in a card,

863
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:28,526
I have these properties
I would like for you to see.

864
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:31,624
What does this mean?
What do you want it to mean?

865
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,829
You see what I'm saying?

866
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,873
Things happen to you.

867
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,771
Glad I met you.

868
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:44,541
I'm glad I met you,
James.

869
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:49,311
I want to show you
something.

870
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:51,911
It may mean something to you,
it may not.

871
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,822
I don't know.
I don't know anymore.

872
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:00,654
What is that?
Florida.

873
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,564
Glengarry Highlands.
Florida.

874
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,625
Bullshit.
And maybe that's true.

875
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:09,831
And that's what I said.

876
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:12,431
But look at this.

877
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,946
What is this?
This is a piece of land.

878
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,482
Listen to what I'm going
to tell you now.

879
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,637
- What happened?
- Where do you work?

880
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,307
I work, yes.
I work here.

881
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,816
- What is it? What happened?
- Robbery.

882
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:05,320
Williamson. Williamson,
did they get the contracts?

883
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,398
All right, tell me.
Now. Tell me.

884
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,298
- They stole the contracts?
- Excuse me, sir.

885
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:13,768
- Did they get my contract?
- Excuse me, fella.

886
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,065
- Did they?
- Would you excuse us?

887
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:17,265
Don't fuck with me, fella.
I'm talking about a Cadillac car

888
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,968
- That you owe me.
- They didn't get your contract.

889
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,409
- I filed it before I left.
- They didn't get my contracts?

890
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:24,413
They got... excuse me.

891
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:26,506
Fuck.

892
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,347
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Williamson!

893
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,320
- Williamson, open the fucking door.
- Who are you?

894
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,516
- They didn't get the contracts.
- Did they?

895
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,116
They got... listen to me.
They got some of them.

896
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:39,856
- Some of them?
- Who told you?

897
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,263
Who told me?
Who told me we had a robbery?

898
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:44,994
We got a fucking board
up on the window.

899
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:49,528
Who is this? Yes.
Yes, I confess. I did it.

900
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,904
Now, leave me
a second here, please.

901
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:54,637
- Okay, now, talk to me.
- I'm still trying to sort it out.

902
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,872
- So far...
- Talk to me. Talk to me.

903
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,212
They got some
of the contracts?

904
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,480
Lingk. James Lingk,
which I closed last night.

905
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:05,214
- You closed it last night?
- Yes.

906
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,951
- I filed it. It went down.
- You filed it?

907
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,391
- James Lingk?
- Yes.

908
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,395
- It was sent downtown?
- Yes, all right?

909
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,397
I filed it last night.
It went to the bank.

910
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,831
- It went downtown, all right?
- You filed it?

911
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:20,563
Then I'm over the fucking top,
you owe me a Cadillac.

912
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,832
- I don't...
- I don't want to hear any shit.

913
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:25,875
I don't give a shit.
Lingk puts me over the top.

914
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,934
You filed it. It went downtown.
Now you owe me the car.

915
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:31,981
- The robbery makes difficult...
- Fuck you! You owe me the car!

916
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:34,676
See, 'cause this is how
we keep score, "bubby."

917
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:37,914
You told me, "Close thus,
and so you get the car."

918
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,980
- I got it.
- Would you excuse us, please?

919
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,992
You hear what I said?
Do you hear what I said?

920
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,587
Hey, pal!
Your excuses are your own!

921
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,866
"Recontact James Lingk.

922
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:04,778
6:00 p.m. Morton Grove."
Ah-ha.

923
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,339
When do you expect
her in?
