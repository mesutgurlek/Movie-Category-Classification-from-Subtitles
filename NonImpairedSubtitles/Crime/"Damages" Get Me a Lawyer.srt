4
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,000
Detective Blood, half naked,

5
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:17,599
wandering the streets at 7:00 A.M.

6
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,300
Detective Just your type.

7
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You get a name?

8
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:22,699
She's not responsive.

9
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,200
All we found on her was this.

10
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,800
"Hollis M. Nye, attorney-at-law. "

11
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,599
The rest is a mess.

12
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,099
I guess we know her lawyer.

13
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,199
Or her John.

14
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,600
Or both.

15
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
You want to get her some clothes?

16
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,400
Who the hell are you, sweetheart?

17
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,899
Ellen, I think you'll find
our offer more than fair

18
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,800
for someone just out of law school.

19
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,399
We'd like to bring you
in as a junior associate,

20
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,900
five years guaranteed
with a starting salary of...

21
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,899
Ellen Holy shit.

22
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,100
Damn right, "holy shit. "

23
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,100
Congratulations.

24
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,899
You can go ahead and breathe now.

25
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,800
Saying yes is going to be the easy part.

26
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,900
Ellen...

27
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,500
with whom else have you met?

28
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,399
No one, Mr. Nye, but

29
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,900
Hewes & associates called me yesterday.

30
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,300
Patty Hewes.

31
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,799
Well... good luck to you.

32
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,200
You might have mentioned that sooner. Hmm?

33
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,400
All right, I'll tell ms. Hewes.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,599
$25 million is their final offer.

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,000
No, it isn't.

36
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,400
They don't have the stomach for a verdict.

37
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,599
The answer's "no," Mr. Cutler.

38
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,800
Enough of this shit.

39
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,299
Would you please put Patty on the phone?

40
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,800
Shayes He wants to talk to you.

41
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,499
Nothing's changed, Mr. Cutler.

42
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,300
$150 million to settle.

43
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,400
Put her on the goddamned line.

44
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,899
Yes, martin.

45
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,299
You want to be professional for a second?

46
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,399
Spring's almost here. I adore it.

47
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,100
Rebirth.

48
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,599
Do you think that's because
I'm a water sign?

49
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,799
I'm trying to do you a favor, Patty.

50
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,850
You see the way that forewoman
was looking at me?

51
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:31,699
I'm a pisces, what are you?

52
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,600
Who gives a shit?

53
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,299
Fine. Aries.

54
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,505
April 3rd,

55
00:04:39,506 --> 00:04:41,445
house of the rising

56
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:44,794
retrograde mercury bullshit.

57
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,099
$25 million, Patty.

58
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,499
Aries is a fire sign, martin.

59
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,882
25, Patty.

60
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:53,499
Throw me back something I can work with.

61
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,300
Your sign's function in life
is to resolve conflict.

62
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,800
Cutler You're right. 25.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,500
I guess this time you came up short.

64
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,999
This is charity, Patty.

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,645
I shredded your experts on cross.

66
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:08,697
Did you?

67
00:05:08,698 --> 00:05:10,710
You didn't prove my client was at fault.

68
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,700
Children died, martin.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Ms. Hewes?

70
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:17,600
The verdict's coming in.

71
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,299
It's your last chance to get off cheap.

72
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,300
150.

73
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:23,799
50, Patty. Tops.

74
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,000
Reggie dwayne thomas.

75
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:27,499
Who the hell's that?

76
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,199
A second grader and a mets fan.

77
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,099
You know him as patient 61.

78
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,399
As his immune system was being decimated,

79
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,833
reggie asked me for wo things...

80
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:36,844
75, Patty.

81
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:38,799
...That his team make the playoffs

82
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,000
and that someone punish
the company that made him sick.

83
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,199
All right, goddamn it, 150!

84
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,900
That's it, we're done.

85
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,100
Soon as you tell it to the judge.

86
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,500
150.

87
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,700
You're a real hard-dicked bitch,
you know that?

88
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,500
Afternoon, madam foreman.

89
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,099
I thought you just reached a verdict.

90
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,498
Not at quiznos, we didn't.
We broke for lunch.

91
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,500
If you were a man,
I'd kick the living dogshit out of you.

92
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,600
If you were a man, I'd be worried.

93
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,499
And then I left 150 grand on the table.

94
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,458
That's twice the money
my parents make in a year.

95
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,900
Combined.

96
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,799
Am I crazy?

97
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,900
David I hope so.

98
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,299
You want to grab a table?

99
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,900
First round's on me.

100
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,599
What the hell is he doing here?

101
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,700
Who?

102
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,700
Mr. Nye.

103
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,899
I was told this is your spot.

104
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,900
All my secrets are out, huh?

105
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,899
I appreciate your offer today.

106
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,499
Oh, no, no, no, we're fine.

107
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,400
We have a lot of good candidates.

108
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,400
It's you I'm worried about.

109
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,471
Say, is, uh... is that your boyfriend?

110
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,200
Yeah.

111
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,600
Are you two happy?

112
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,900
Very.

113
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,500
I'm sorry to hear that.

114
00:07:33,097 --> 00:07:34,107
Excuse me?

115
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:36,699
There won't be room for him and Patty.

116
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,399
There won't be room for you and Patty.

117
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,299
With Patty Hewes, there's only Patty.

118
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,900
Oh, I came here for a favor.

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,600
Could you autograph that for me, please?

120
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,500
It'll clear my conscience.

121
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,300
You're special, Ellen.

122
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,000
But that'll only make the fall harder.

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,499
What are you talking about?

124
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,700
Your ambition.

125
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,899
Maybe we need people like Patty

126
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,999
who see their destiny
in grander terms than the rest of us.

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,600
But that doesn't mean
that you should go work for her.

128
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,600
So think about it.

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,400
My offer's still good.

130
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,199
My interview is on wednesday.

131
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,870
I haven't even gotten the job yet.

132
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:18,880
You will.

133
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:21,297
Once Patty meets you,
there's no turning back.

134
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,900
She'll see what I see.

135
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,507
And she'll own you.

136
00:08:37,696 --> 00:08:39,855
I've invited you to the show a
hundred times before.

137
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:41,810
You've never come, so why now?

138
00:08:42,282 --> 00:08:44,564
Well, actually, I
thought it wasDeal or No Deal.

139
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:46,120
I mean, where's the bald guy?

140
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:48,131
He's backstage.
We stuffed him in a briefcase.

141
00:08:49,122 --> 00:08:51,281
So what's the real story? Why now?

142
00:08:51,691 --> 00:08:54,260
I'm here because of Arthur Frobisher.

143
00:08:54,997 --> 00:08:58,323
5,000 of his employees lost
their life savings

144
00:08:58,324 --> 00:08:59,874
as a result of his actions.

145
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:01,289
Alleged actions.

146
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,687
He was found not guilty at a
criminal trial.

147
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:05,375
No, it's a matter of public record.

148
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:07,552
Arthur Frobisher told his employees

149
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:09,179
to invest in the company

150
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:10,928
and then sold his own stock.

151
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:12,653
It's classic pump and dump.

152
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:15,278
He claims he had a prior arrangement
with his broker to sell.

153
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,395
You believe that?

154
00:09:16,785 --> 00:09:19,887
Arthur Frobisher made hundreds
of millions

155
00:09:19,888 --> 00:09:21,199
in personal profit

156
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:24,301
while his workers lost their
pensions, their 401Ks,

157
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,340
everything they had.

158
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:26,803
Government couldn't prove it.

159
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:29,725
Greta, I think there's
a lot of things our government can't do.

160
00:09:29,726 --> 00:09:30,999
We're gonna take a quick break.

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,801
We'll be right back with high-stakes
litigator, Patty Hewes. And we're out.

162
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:37,381
- That was great.
- It's good to meet you finally.

163
00:09:37,382 --> 00:09:38,413
- Nice to meet you.
- Tom

164
00:09:38,414 --> 00:09:40,053
confirmed the client
reps for tomorrow.

165
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:41,133
Good.

166
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:42,855
Wish my girlfriend could've been here.

167
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:44,327
We're huge Greta fans.

168
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,159
You have a girlfriend?

169
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:48,240
She teaches at your son's school.

170
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:50,405
I thought you were gay.

171
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,814
Ms. Hewes, tell us what we can do.

172
00:09:55,815 --> 00:09:56,873
You're our lawyer.

173
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:59,002
We're in the news every day.

174
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:00,291
Look at this.

175
00:10:00,874 --> 00:10:04,565
Frobisher's lawyer called us
greedy in theWall Street Journal.

176
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:07,155
On CNN, he said we're the bloodsuckers.

177
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,602
I warned you the media war was coming.

178
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,187
Well, here it is.

179
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:13,567
I don't want my
grandkids hearing these lies.

180
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:15,803
I know, Larry, it's deeply upsetting.

181
00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:18,154
And Frobisher's people are
spinning his case

182
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:20,655
exactly the way we would expect them to.

183
00:10:20,656 --> 00:10:22,418
Well, what can we do about it?

184
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:24,601
I need you to understand this.

185
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:27,116
We are engaging in a battle

186
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:29,274
with a man who will stop at nothing

187
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:30,847
to preserve his fortune.

188
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:35,323
High-stakes litigation is a long
and painful process.

189
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,795
Frobisher will destroy us in the press,

190
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,804
he will attack us personally,

191
00:10:40,886 --> 00:10:44,481
he will try to turn our lives upside down
so that we'll want to settle.

192
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:48,781
Meanwhile, his attorneys will
spin him as the good guy,

193
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,870
the aggrieved innocent victim.

194
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:55,597
So we have to be patient,

195
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:57,713
and we have to stay strong.

196
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:01,360
But most of all, we have to all
stick together.

197
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,322
If we do that,

198
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,277
we'll win.

199
00:11:11,577 --> 00:11:13,657
Okay, enough already.

200
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:16,100
- Sorry.
- Was I pushing it?

201
00:11:16,101 --> 00:11:18,843
No, it's good, I just haven't
exercised in, like, three months.

202
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,356
The restaurant's killing me.

203
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:22,064
I've never worked so hard in my life.

204
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:23,421
Did you hire a staff yet?

205
00:11:23,422 --> 00:11:24,494
Starting to.

206
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:25,858
Would you look over some contracts?

207
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:26,892
- Yeah.
- Saffron.

208
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:29,160
Good girl.

209
00:11:29,912 --> 00:11:31,221
Oh, nice work.

210
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:33,023
You actually got my sister to
break a sweat.

211
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:34,862
Yeah. Oh, you ass.

212
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:37,002
Oh, my God.

213
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:39,659
- What is it?
- They bumped up my interview.

214
00:11:45,923 --> 00:11:48,532
Ms. Hewes, we're ready for your
briefing in conference room one.

215
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:49,655
Thank you, Felicia.

216
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,575
I'm sorry, someone helping you?

217
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,170
Uh, I'm Ellen Parsons.

218
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,630
Who?

219
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:00,039
I'm here for, um, to interview.

220
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:02,822
Well, good luck to you.

221
00:12:04,826 --> 00:12:05,971
Ellen?

222
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:07,470
Tom Shayes.

223
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:08,722
We spoke on the phone.

224
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:09,828
- Oh. Hello.
- Right.

225
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:12,650
Right this way.

226
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:13,676
Here you go.

227
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:17,024
So, one of the advantages, you
know, you're not going to be

228
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:19,402
buried in paperwork your first year.

229
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:25,008
Unlike big firms, Patty believes
in a team approach,

230
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:26,198
that kind of thing.

231
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:29,614
Sorry, Tom.

232
00:12:29,723 --> 00:12:31,677
That's okay, it's all right.

233
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:33,408
Ellen, Uncle Pete.

234
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:35,649
Uncle Pete's been with Patty
longer than any of us.

235
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,594
He's really the one who runs
everything around here.

236
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:39,882
- Good to meet you, Ellen.
- Nice to meet you.

237
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:41,093
It's dry cleaning.

238
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,895
We've been working on the
Frobisher case 24/7.

239
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:48,091
Some of our associates haven't,
haven't been able to go home yet.

240
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,312
It's best not to go into an
interview with Patty cold.

241
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:56,401
Most likely, she'll grill you on
precedents for our current case,

242
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:58,793
but any topic is fair game...

243
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:00,925
constitutional law, torts, contracts.

244
00:13:00,926 --> 00:13:01,938
No problem.

245
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:04,986
Patty is not looking
to see how you handle the facts,

246
00:13:04,987 --> 00:13:07,826
she's looking to see how you
handle yourself, how you think,

247
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:09,265
how you express yourself.

248
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:10,266
Okay, got it.

249
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:12,317
Yeah. No, you don't.

250
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:17,992
when it comes to reading
people, Patty lives and dies by instinct.

251
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:22,533
The woman has the sharpes
bullshit meter I've ever seen.

252
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,733
And you're at the most difficult step.

253
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:26,550
It's do or die.

254
00:13:26,783 --> 00:13:29,605
If you're phony with her for one second,

255
00:13:30,015 --> 00:13:32,038
she'll skewer you.

256
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,976
Good. Phony's not my strong suit.

257
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:36,453
Good.

258
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:41,145
So we have you sitting down with
Patty Saturday.

259
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:43,291
Come again?

260
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:44,370
Exact time TBD.

261
00:13:44,371 --> 00:13:47,008
We're going to ask that you just
leave the whole day available.

262
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:49,168
I thought the interview was today.

263
00:13:49,346 --> 00:13:50,643
No, no.

264
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:53,586
We couldn't have you sit down with
Patty without you meeting me first.

265
00:13:53,587 --> 00:13:55,267
But I can't do Saturday.

266
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,484
Work it out.

267
00:13:57,485 --> 00:13:59,308
Patty's schedule is impossible.

268
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,297
My sister's getting married on Saturday.

269
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:04,236
All day?

270
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:06,137
You know, you didn't just think that.

271
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,785
You actually said it.

272
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:11,000
Look, Ellen,

273
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:12,763
most people never get this chance.

274
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:14,335
Do you want it or not?

275
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,408
My dog's on a leash. Come on.

276
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:35,126
Makes you long for the reasoned
justice of the courtroom, don't it?

277
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:40,606
Ray, I didn't know you
walked your own dog.

278
00:14:40,832 --> 00:14:42,008
Which one is yours?

279
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:43,798
Under the tree. The Doberman.

280
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:44,946
Yours?

281
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:47,980
He's that mutt over
there trying to hump the Ridgeback.

282
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,844
Sorry.

283
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:53,851
Hey, you know, I
caught you on TV last night.

284
00:14:55,015 --> 00:14:57,799
Seems foolish to get your
clients'hopes up when

285
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,775
the government already spit the bit.

286
00:15:00,874 --> 00:15:03,034
Federal prosecutors proved
nothing against my client.

287
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,311
Heaven knows, neither will you.

288
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:06,081
I'm at a dog park, Ray.

289
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,231
You're right, you're right.

290
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,090
Let's not have this get

291
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,398
pissy like last time.

292
00:15:18,555 --> 00:15:20,878
Give me a number, Patty.

293
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:25,213
Mr. Frobisher's already lost three years
of his life to a government trial.

294
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:28,370
Maybe I can talk him into saving
himself another three.

295
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:30,513
A jury will give him a number, Ray.

296
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:35,021
You in this for your
clients or to destroy Arthur Frobisher?

297
00:15:36,948 --> 00:15:38,145
Both.

298
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:44,778
You are so full of shit, Patty.

299
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:49,403
You know what I like most about you?

300
00:15:50,428 --> 00:15:51,999
You have no case.

301
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:58,786
Come on! Nice seeing you, Ray.

302
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,154
Aunt Barb and Uncle Fran all the way from

303
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:07,480
California.

304
00:16:07,481 --> 00:16:10,114
And, Cathy and Rich, thank you so much,

305
00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:12,205
coming all the way from New Jersey.

306
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,242
And I want to thank everyone...

307
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:16,128
You know you actually
make that dress work?

308
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:20,307
Thanks, babe.

309
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:23,398
You okay?

310
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,676
Yeah, it's...

311
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:29,518
the one day of the year
I can't interview,

312
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:31,417
and they won't reschedule.

313
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:35,340
They're Hewes & Associates.

314
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:39,055
I know, I know.

315
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:42,666
I especially want to thank my sister,

316
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:44,672
Ellen.

317
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:48,309
And even though I've got three
years on her,

318
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:50,264
Ellie's always

319
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:52,765
been my big sister, you know?

320
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:55,826
Always giving me advice, and...

321
00:16:57,288 --> 00:17:00,322
I swore to myself I was going
to make it through without crying.

322
00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:02,468
I love you, Carrie.

323
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,448
Okay, here she goes again.

324
00:17:06,444 --> 00:17:08,999
I wish I could have been a
better role model, you know, but

325
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,501
you were always

326
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:14,241
perfect at everything, and...

327
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,987
there wasn't ever anything
you need me for, so...

328
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:42,133
Well, if it isn't the maid of honor.

329
00:17:42,735 --> 00:17:44,299
Thought you might need a breather.

330
00:17:44,353 --> 00:17:45,770
Ms. Hewes.

331
00:17:46,404 --> 00:17:48,194
What are you doing here?

332
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:49,725
I had to meet you.

333
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:52,083
Why?

334
00:17:52,513 --> 00:17:56,343
Because, kiddo, you're the first person
stupid enough to turn me down.

335
00:17:59,308 --> 00:18:01,550
I'm glad I'm not in your shoes.

336
00:18:02,028 --> 00:18:05,367
Family toasts, public displays
of affection...

337
00:18:05,368 --> 00:18:07,540
absolute torture.

338
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:09,332
Bourbon?

339
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:13,619
Helps take the edge off.

340
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,439
I should probably just bite the bullet.

341
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,243
So what about you, Ellen?

342
00:18:20,074 --> 00:18:22,326
Do you see a husband in your future?

343
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,982
Yeah, I guess.

344
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:26,499
I hope so.

345
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:28,774
You know what they say.

346
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,017
"Hope is the thing with feathers. "

347
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,560
Emily Dickinson.

348
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:35,353
That bitch will say anything.

349
00:18:36,928 --> 00:18:39,101
Ms. Hewes, I'm sorry I missed
our meeting today.

350
00:18:39,102 --> 00:18:41,055
No, no. I understand. I understand.

351
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,086
The good sister.

352
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,573
It's just that this is family, and

353
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:45,498
if I skipped the wedding
for a job interview...

354
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,603
You'd confirm their worst fear.

355
00:18:48,464 --> 00:18:49,844
Which is?

356
00:18:50,227 --> 00:18:53,430
They're good, hardworking people,
and they're afraid of losing you.

357
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:56,300
Wait. How long have you been here?

358
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,821
They actually remind me of my family.

359
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:00,927
You love them, you do anything for them.

360
00:19:00,928 --> 00:19:04,015
The problem is, they don't have
your ambition.

361
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:06,796
What's the problem?

362
00:19:06,954 --> 00:19:09,946
You try to lead by example,
and they want you to lead,

363
00:19:10,538 --> 00:19:12,178
and then they resent you for it.

364
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,296
They put you on a pedestal, look
up to you,

365
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:16,996
and then blame you for
the crick in their necks.

366
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:19,373
Oh, that problem.

367
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:22,079
I know how hard you
worked to get your shot with me,

368
00:19:22,476 --> 00:19:25,182
but you turned it down to be
with your family.

369
00:19:27,163 --> 00:19:29,364
That's an interesting choice.

370
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,371
Ms. Hewes?

371
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,853
Is there any way I could still
interview?

372
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:45,151
I think it would be a
waste of time, Ellen.

373
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,006
You're hired.

374
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:34,391
I hate to interrupt your morning,
Art, but it's not good.

375
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:36,113
<i>All right, how much does she want?</i>

376
00:20:36,114 --> 00:20:37,694
Say again? I can barely hear you.

377
00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:43,278
Yeah, I'm in the middle of a
storm here, Ray.

378
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,673
How much does she want?

379
00:20:44,783 --> 00:20:47,161
She wouldn't give me a number.

380
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,502
If she's got a pulse, she's got a price.

381
00:20:50,503 --> 00:20:52,101
Well, it's one you can't afford.

382
00:20:52,102 --> 00:20:55,244
She's on a mission here, and she
won't stop till you're strung up

383
00:20:55,245 --> 00:20:56,544
in the public square.

384
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,165
All right, you know what?

385
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,846
It's time you made the call, Ray.

386
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:01,842
We're not there yet, Art.

387
00:21:02,107 --> 00:21:03,788
I'm sick of this shit

388
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:06,685
First the government, now this bitch!

389
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:10,229
Do you know something?

390
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,746
My wife's about to leave me

391
00:21:11,747 --> 00:21:12,797
<i>because of this.</i>

392
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:14,999
<i>My kids are getting harassed at school.</i>

393
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,730
This bullshit never ends.

394
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:18,562
Make the call.

395
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:20,899
I want some leverage.

396
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,600
Give me some time.
No. Time's up.

397
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:26,044
Hey, Ray, what...
you called them "bloodsuckers"?

398
00:21:26,304 --> 00:21:27,435
What's that about?

399
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,188
Come on.
Lighten up on the rhetoric.

400
00:21:31,141 --> 00:21:32,289
Art...

401
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,888
Yeah, I can't hear you.

402
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:37,496
Look, if you need me, I'm going
to be at the Brewster Trauma Center.

403
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:40,765
My idiot brother-in-law can't drive.

404
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,771
I'm going with you, so wait just
one second.

405
00:21:46,452 --> 00:21:49,786
Arthur Frobisher's dossier,
and his broker, Gary Genow.

406
00:21:49,787 --> 00:21:51,002
What do you know?

407
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:53,299
The government lost
because they couldn't link these guys.

408
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,993
Frobisher claimed he had a preexisting
agreement to sell his stock.

409
00:21:55,994 --> 00:21:58,209
Genow backs him up, but that's a crock.

410
00:21:58,673 --> 00:21:59,925
Very good. However,

411
00:22:00,034 --> 00:22:02,451
Frobisher and Genow
were both in Florida the weekend

412
00:22:02,452 --> 00:22:03,711
prior to the sell off.

413
00:22:03,712 --> 00:22:06,212
We don't have a
case unless we can connect

414
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:08,366
Frobisher with his broker.

415
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:11,442
Which the government couldn't do even
though both men were in Florida?

416
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,464
We interviewed
every employee, colleague and

417
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:17,082
golf buddy within 100 miles of
Arthur Frobisher on the day in question.

418
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,254
And we managed to piece
together Frobisher's whereabouts.

419
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,435
On Saturday, June 19, from 9:00
a. m. to 1:00 p. m.,

420
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:24,991
he plays 18 holes in Palm Beach.

421
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:28,292
We interviewed club
members, guests and employees,

422
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:31,459
but no sign of his broker.

423
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:35,258
From 1:00 p. m. to 3:00, he lunches
with a few of his fortune 500 pals...

424
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:37,555
lobster bisque, Kobe beef.

425
00:22:37,746 --> 00:22:39,828
But his broker is nowhere to be found.

426
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:42,138
From 3:00 p. m. to 6:00 p. m.,

427
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:44,992
Frobisher's at the spa getting
a full body treatment.

428
00:22:44,993 --> 00:22:46,225
For three hours?

429
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,974
What was he getting waxed?

430
00:22:49,556 --> 00:22:52,366
6:00 p. m., Frobisher flies home
in his private jet,

431
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:54,758
arrives at Teterboro
Airport at 9:00 p. m.

432
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:57,151
He's home safe and sound by 10:00.

433
00:22:57,219 --> 00:23:01,090
So somehow Frobisher and his broker
communicated down in Florida,

434
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:02,832
but no one saw them together.

435
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:05,661
So they probably used an intermediary.
Someone played messenger.

436
00:23:05,662 --> 00:23:08,783
Unfortunately, that could be anyone
in the entire state of Florida.

437
00:23:09,037 --> 00:23:12,418
Patty's got all her contacts in
the Sunshine State looking into it.

438
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:14,017
Whatever happened,

439
00:23:14,332 --> 00:23:16,655
someone down there must know something.

440
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:18,764
Ellen?

441
00:23:19,392 --> 00:23:21,524
You've got a 4:00 p. m. at Bergdorf's.

442
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,847
Go to VIP Services.
Talk to Suzanne.

443
00:23:23,848 --> 00:23:25,760
She knows what Patty likes.

444
00:23:26,635 --> 00:23:27,772
First...

445
00:23:29,972 --> 00:23:31,678
your home away from home.

446
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,068
Free piece of advice.

447
00:23:36,778 --> 00:23:38,933
Don't... don't make it your own.

448
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:41,775
Patty doesn't want family photographs,

449
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,974
tchotchkes, knickknacks.

450
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:47,139
And don't bring anything you can't carry
out in one trip when she fires you.

451
00:23:47,578 --> 00:23:49,273
I'm kidding... sort of.

452
00:23:49,683 --> 00:23:51,582
Frobisher discovery.

453
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,332
Patty will need a full summary.

454
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:55,109
She wants to see how you write.

455
00:24:25,603 --> 00:24:27,433
Her name is Ellen Parsons.

456
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:29,429
- You her lawyer?
- Is she okay?

457
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,726
Are you her lawyer?

458
00:24:30,727 --> 00:24:31,751
No. A friend.

459
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:35,257
You have a current address?

460
00:24:35,396 --> 00:24:36,927
Yes. Certainly.

461
00:24:40,891 --> 00:24:42,462
She lives with her fiancé.

462
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,090
Okay, that was insane.

463
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:25,717
There's more.

464
00:25:25,718 --> 00:25:26,839
Let me grab those.

465
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,262
There were, like, five women
helping me try on a pair of pants.

466
00:25:31,494 --> 00:25:33,244
Oh! I'd enjoy that.

467
00:25:34,275 --> 00:25:36,407
At one point, I was half naked,

468
00:25:36,408 --> 00:25:39,285
and Barbara Walters walked
into the dressing room.

469
00:25:39,286 --> 00:25:41,696
That... not so much.

470
00:25:43,268 --> 00:25:46,910
They had everything
ready to go, pulled in my size.

471
00:25:47,475 --> 00:25:48,475
Nice.

472
00:25:50,422 --> 00:25:52,532
Can't wait for a reason to wear it.

473
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:58,030
Oh, wait.

474
00:25:58,462 --> 00:25:59,528
This isn't mine.

475
00:25:59,965 --> 00:26:01,018
No?

476
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:03,800
How did this get in here?

477
00:26:04,885 --> 00:26:05,960
I don't know.

478
00:26:19,733 --> 00:26:20,834
Baby.

479
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,818
I hear we're a little
behind schedule for the opening.

480
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:38,008
Frank...

481
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:40,457
In the restaurant business,

482
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,767
a little behind is a lot ahead.

483
00:27:42,768 --> 00:27:44,461
We're doing just fine.

484
00:27:44,487 --> 00:27:46,974
But you did say you
would call before you came.

485
00:27:46,975 --> 00:27:50,993
Oh, my boss wanted me
to check up on his investment.

486
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,059
And good news...

487
00:27:53,476 --> 00:27:55,690
I was able to push this through.

488
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:00,419
My liquor license!

489
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:02,915
Oh, excellent. Thank you.

490
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,898
Hey, there, fella.

491
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:08,342
What's his name?

492
00:28:08,588 --> 00:28:09,652
Her.

493
00:28:09,777 --> 00:28:10,998
Saffron.

494
00:28:12,385 --> 00:28:13,997
Got one myself.

495
00:28:14,955 --> 00:28:17,589
Most loyal creatures on God's
green Earth.

496
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:20,996
Oh, one more thing.

497
00:28:21,597 --> 00:28:23,887
I need your Jane Hancock...

498
00:28:25,268 --> 00:28:28,261
here and here.

499
00:28:31,131 --> 00:28:33,687
I think I've already
signed one of these.

500
00:28:33,726 --> 00:28:37,028
Oh, this just
clarifies the scope of your

501
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:39,234
existing confidentiality agreement.

502
00:28:39,235 --> 00:28:41,161
I do hate housekeeping.

503
00:28:43,744 --> 00:28:45,434
It's standard boilerplate.

504
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,945
Okay, I'll get my lawyer to take a look.

505
00:28:50,016 --> 00:28:51,628
There's some problem?

506
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:53,296
No, no problem. I just...

507
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:56,453
Permits are coming through,
you're getting everything you need?

508
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:57,906
Yeah, absolutely.

509
00:28:57,907 --> 00:28:59,532
You guys have been great.

510
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,174
Good. I'm glad to hear that.

511
00:29:02,512 --> 00:29:05,505
I'd hate for anything to hold up
your opening.

512
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,057
Oh, so would I.

513
00:29:09,703 --> 00:29:10,728
I'm sorry.

514
00:29:10,837 --> 00:29:12,491
I'm going to have to get back to work.

515
00:29:12,614 --> 00:29:13,808
By all means.

516
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,906
Good girl, Saffron.

517
00:29:19,227 --> 00:29:21,033
You be a good girl, too.

518
00:29:32,802 --> 00:29:36,588
My great-great
grandfather designed this.

519
00:29:38,413 --> 00:29:41,299
He grew rich on the munition
demands of the Civil War.

520
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:45,003
In fact, he started this club
over a hundred years ago.

521
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,994
I hear you know your way around
a rifle, Larry.

522
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:51,960
The Marines was
a long time ago, Mr. Frobisher.

523
00:29:54,624 --> 00:29:57,618
These guns are all
that's left of my family's fortune.

524
00:29:57,987 --> 00:29:59,534
The Depression wiped us out.

525
00:29:59,535 --> 00:30:01,051
I didn't know that.

526
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,309
Yeah.

527
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:04,497
Sit down, come on.

528
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:11,897
- That's good lemonade, isn't it?
- Yeah.

529
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:16,120
I grew up with nothing.

530
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:20,060
At 17, I walked out of my
father's house without a dime,

531
00:30:20,825 --> 00:30:23,777
bullheaded and full of pride.

532
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:29,216
It took almost three decades,
but I built my company

533
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:31,717
from the ground up.

534
00:30:34,941 --> 00:30:37,058
That company meant everything to me.

535
00:30:41,004 --> 00:30:44,651
But what happened to you... to
all my employees, is a tragedy.

536
00:30:48,252 --> 00:30:49,252
Yes, it is.

537
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,070
But, Larry,

538
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,170
Patty Hewes...

539
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,169
she's not the answer.

540
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,770
I mean, she's an egomaniac,

541
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,570
and she's going to lose.

542
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,769
You know why?

543
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,169
No, sir.

544
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,870
Because I didn't do it.

545
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,969
I'm a very rich man.

546
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,270
I make no apologies for that.

547
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,369
But I'm also an innocent man,

548
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:22,406
and I want to come to some
reasonable solution to this.

549
00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:24,970
What do you want from me?

550
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,870
All right, um...

551
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,469
I know that you have the employees'ear,

552
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,070
that they trust you.

553
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,680
I think that you and I together...

554
00:31:38,268 --> 00:31:39,443
could end this.

555
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,269
Now, we'll... we'll be discreet.

556
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,150
We'll take care of you
when this is all settled, but

557
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,669
all I'm asking for is a number

558
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,770
that you think is fair.

559
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,270
That's all.

560
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:09,170
Mr. Frobisher has a number for you.

561
00:32:20,743 --> 00:32:22,469
He wants to settle for $100 million?

562
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,365
- That's ridiculous.
- That's total bullshit,

563
00:32:24,366 --> 00:32:26,169
but it's our duty
to take it to the clients.

564
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,467
What if they accept?

565
00:32:27,604 --> 00:32:28,869
It's never going to happen.

566
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,370
This is Patty Hewes.

567
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,670
Watch and learn.

568
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,770
Arthur Frobisher stole your future.

569
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,935
He stole financial security

570
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,832
from your children and
your children's children.

571
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:46,509
Now, this offer...
it might pay for today's bills,

572
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,369
but you've got to remember
there are 5,000 of you.

573
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,369
There's going to be nothing
left for tomorrow.

574
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,369
Frobisher wants this case settled

575
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,069
before we can expose the truth.

576
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,169
You want the truth?

577
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,370
We're broke.

578
00:32:59,654 --> 00:33:01,088
- Exactly.
- $100 million.

579
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:03,894
Mrs. Hewes, that's a one with
a hell of a lot of zeroes.

580
00:33:03,895 --> 00:33:04,929
Absolutely,

581
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:08,770
but it's what Frobisher wants
to pay to get rid of you.

582
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,069
If you want to send a message to this man,

583
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,170
he has to pay a price
that he can't afford.

584
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:20,170
Frobisher's net worth is upward
of two and a half billion dollars.

585
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:24,169
now $100 million sounds like
a lot of money, and it is,

586
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,845
but it's less than five percent
of what this man is worth.

587
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,570
I think we have a strong case.

588
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,569
I'd like to take it to a jury
and let them decide

589
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:36,770
what Mr. Arthur Frobisher owes you.

590
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:40,370
Now, hold on, hold on here, people.

591
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,487
We discussed this,

592
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,947
and we all agreed if Frobisher
ever offered

593
00:33:45,948 --> 00:33:48,680
$100 million we'd accept it.

594
00:33:49,172 --> 00:33:50,270
Do you know about this?

595
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,170
Of course not.

596
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:56,370
It's ridiculous.

597
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,140
Mrs. Hewes, you work
the percentage, right?

598
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:02,012
- Right.
- More money from

599
00:34:02,013 --> 00:34:04,670
Frobisher means more money for you.

600
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,470
The rich get richer.

601
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,670
You're absolutely right.

602
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,670
I have made a lot of money.

603
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,570
I'm good at what I do.

604
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,869
But it also affords me the luxury
to only take cases

605
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,903
that I feel passionately about.

606
00:34:18,904 --> 00:34:20,869
And I feel passionately about this case.

607
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,569
If we turn this settlement down,

608
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:25,974
the case could drag on for years
and we could end up getting nothing.

609
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:30,170
You can survive that... we can't.

610
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,170
Let's stick to our plan.

611
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:38,370
Take this money and get on with our lives.

612
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:45,569
Karen, Larry, if I may,

613
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,969
I just want to say one thing...

614
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,169
All due respect, Mrs. Hewes,

615
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,070
I say we end this here and now.

616
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,969
On behalf of custodial services,

617
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:57,570
I vote to accept the settlement.

618
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:22,661
I am pleased to present
the american bar association's

619
00:35:23,044 --> 00:35:26,242
national public service award

620
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:31,270
to Patricia C. Hewes.

621
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,670
Thank you, george.

622
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,269
I'm particularly touched
to receive this award from you

623
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,469
and thanks to the aba for
your recognition and support.

624
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,070
I'm deeply honored and grateful.

625
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,470
And all of you for coming
out this morning.

626
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,870
I have to admit,

627
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:55,069
I wouldn't want to give up
my saturday morning to listen to me,

628
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,469
so I will...

629
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,270
I will try to be brief.

630
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,980
Look at her.

631
00:36:00,981 --> 00:36:02,429
Normally, she turns this shit down.

632
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,870
She hates awards.

633
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:05,437
Then why is she here?

634
00:36:05,438 --> 00:36:06,470
For the P.R.

635
00:36:06,471 --> 00:36:08,769
...Has just become another tool...

636
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,969
Most cases you get
your clients $100 million,

637
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,370
you're a hero.

638
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,469
But if Frobisher gets off that easy,

639
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,870
the whole legal world
will know she tanked it.

640
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,669
The powerful corrupt the law

641
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:25,670
when they use it as a club
to bludgeon the weak.

642
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:30,370
Yes, ma'am, my produce is
100% locally grown, organic.

643
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,872
And I was trained
at the culinary institute, yes.

644
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:36,970
The culinary institute.

645
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,169
Ma'am, can I...

646
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,170
can I give you a call back?

647
00:37:02,994 --> 00:37:04,018
Hey, sis, what's up?

648
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:05,370
David, where are you?

649
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,548
I'm at Ellen'S.

650
00:37:06,549 --> 00:37:07,969
Just got off a shift. What's up?

651
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,470
We need to talk.

652
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,270
There you are.

653
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,570
Is this the lawyer of the year?

654
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,070
Is this the man who kidnapped my husband?

655
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,370
How's london?

656
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,569
London? Is that where i am?

657
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,970
I've lost track.

658
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,869
Michael's headmaster called.

659
00:37:31,971 --> 00:37:33,769
Yeah, I know.
We're on for monday morning.

660
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,770
I'll have a talk with
Michael when I get home.

661
00:37:35,825 --> 00:37:37,670
Another talk's going to help?

662
00:37:37,848 --> 00:37:39,470
Probably not.

663
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,770
Any headway with the witness?

664
00:37:42,597 --> 00:37:43,649
No.

665
00:37:43,912 --> 00:37:44,930
You eating?

666
00:37:44,964 --> 00:37:47,042
Yeah. More or less.

667
00:37:47,043 --> 00:37:48,070
Sleeping?

668
00:37:48,071 --> 00:37:51,270
Phil, stop it. I'm fine.

669
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,569
No, you're not.

670
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,170
I can hear it in your voice.

671
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,270
Fly safe. I'll see you tomorrow.

672
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:58,670
Bye.

673
00:38:03,045 --> 00:38:06,254
The clients want to know to know why
Patty hasn't accepted the settlement yet.

674
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,070
What is she waiting for?

675
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,570
I don't know.

676
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,870
Why the long face?

677
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:19,670
Lighten up. I just got a goddamn award.

678
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,569
So who's hungry?

679
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:26,770
I'm thinking steak.

680
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,469
Ellen, do you eat meat?

681
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,514
Sure.

682
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,069
Attagirl.

683
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,769
Tom here's a vegan.

684
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,669
Only for health reasons.

685
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,070
Health reasons...

686
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:37,870
right.

687
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:43,070
I know everything about you,
don't I, Tommy?

688
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,822
Who's been with me
ten years come august?

689
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:47,846
I have.

690
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:52,069
And who did I trust to be
my client liaison on this case?

691
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,170
You trusted me.

692
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:57,770
But who let me get blindsided
by their intentions?

693
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,369
How could I have possibly...?

694
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,669
How could you have possibly

695
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,970
made such a catastrophic screw up?

696
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,970
I wish I could answer that.

697
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,275
Enjoy your tofu, tom, you're fired.

698
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:12,470
Are you serious?

699
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:14,786
How about sushi?

700
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:16,110
- Patty...
- Do you like fish?

701
00:39:16,111 --> 00:39:18,269
Your clients purposefully misled me.

702
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,436
I know a great place.

703
00:39:19,437 --> 00:39:21,170
- Listen to me...
- No, you listen to me.

704
00:39:21,171 --> 00:39:22,269
Get out of the car!

705
00:39:22,477 --> 00:39:24,212
- Get out of the car!
- This is bullshit!

706
00:39:24,213 --> 00:39:26,170
Get out!

707
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:34,870
Oh, jesus.

708
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:40,369
Joe, you know the place
I'm thinking about.

709
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,069
That cute little japanese place,

710
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,170
second and what... in the 70s?

711
00:39:44,613 --> 00:39:46,769
You're my sister.
How do you know Arthur Frobisher?

712
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,265
I catered a function
for him and some businessmen.

713
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:50,770
When?

714
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,870
A few years ago.

715
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:55,363
Then a week after the event,
his lawyer called me and told me

716
00:39:55,364 --> 00:39:56,949
Frobisher was a huge fan and

717
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:59,901
that he wanted to help
me open a restaurant.

718
00:40:00,204 --> 00:40:02,034
Katie, why the hell didn't
you tell me that you

719
00:40:02,035 --> 00:40:03,755
worked for Arthur Frobisher?

720
00:40:03,756 --> 00:40:05,615
I didn't know
anything about him at the time.

721
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:08,171
But then the government tried him
and he was all over the news.

722
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,633
Jesus, Katie, you didn't think
that you should mention it?

723
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,570
By that time, I couldn't tell you.

724
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,569
I'd already signed the original
confidentiality agreement.

725
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,636
And now you've got some guy
who's waiting outside...

726
00:40:18,637 --> 00:40:19,881
He needs them signed today?

727
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:21,970
Oh, okay.

728
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:24,070
I'll bring them right over.

729
00:40:26,562 --> 00:40:27,655
What's wrong?

730
00:40:27,656 --> 00:40:29,295
So this function you catered,

731
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,771
was that in florida?

732
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,569
Yeah, palm beach.
How did you know?

733
00:40:32,671 --> 00:40:34,925
Katie, this whole case turns
on one weekend,

734
00:40:34,926 --> 00:40:35,992
and you were there.

735
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,170
Turns how?

736
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,969
Somehow Frobisher communicated
with his broker

737
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,512
down in palm beach.

738
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:44,485
You must have seen something
that they didn't want you to see.

739
00:40:44,486 --> 00:40:46,591
I never even spoke to Frobisher.

740
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,167
I just cooked for the guy.
What could I possibly know?

741
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:50,835
I'm not sure.

742
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,817
The government never contacted you?

743
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:53,970
No.

744
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,508
So obviously I thought that their case
had absolutely nothing to do with me.

745
00:40:58,253 --> 00:41:01,054
I have to tell Patty you were
down there, she should interview you.

746
00:41:01,055 --> 00:41:02,135
She can't.

747
00:41:02,354 --> 00:41:04,349
Katie signed a confidentiality agreement.

748
00:41:04,705 --> 00:41:06,044
A judge can override that.

749
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,469
Wait. You want me to

750
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,970
be a witness against Frobisher?

751
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,492
Yes, if you know something.

752
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,091
He's my investor.

753
00:41:13,665 --> 00:41:14,969
He's the only reason I have this

754
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,469
restaurant in the first place.

755
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,270
If she goes to Patty,
she's going to be screwed.

756
00:41:18,271 --> 00:41:20,269
She will lose everything, won't she?

757
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,570
What should I do?

758
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,370
I don't know.

759
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,170
shit!

760
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,769
Andrew, yes, yes, I'm on my way.

761
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,770
I'm on my way.

762
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,070
I have to go.

763
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,420
So are you going to tell Patty?

764
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,249
Hi, I'm here to see ms. Hewes.

765
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,848
Certainly. Lucia.

766
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:03,513
Esta es la mujer.

767
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,270
Are you Ellen?

768
00:42:05,593 --> 00:42:06,755
Yeah, I guess.

769
00:42:07,178 --> 00:42:08,887
Ms. Hewes had to go to Michael's school.

770
00:42:08,888 --> 00:42:09,970
She waits for you.

771
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:11,069
Oh, okay.

772
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,070
Goodbye, Ellen.

773
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,770
You're staring at me.

774
00:42:30,209 --> 00:42:31,275
Sorry.

775
00:42:33,899 --> 00:42:35,580
What, Ellen? Speak.

776
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,216
You think I shouldn't have fired tom?

777
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,070
It's not for me to say.

778
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,270
This moron always keeps me waiting.

779
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,420
you might as well sit down.

780
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,170
Is everything all right?

781
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:01,070
He's threatening to expel my son.

782
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,670
Oh.

783
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:04,870
I'm sorry.

784
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:10,373
Do yourself a favor, Ellen,
don't have kids.

785
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:13,769
I read an interview once with a

786
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:16,489
nobel prize winner... physicist,

787
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,269
genius, married six times.

788
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,570
He said, "don't have kids. "

789
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,669
Ruins your ambition, keeps you

790
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:23,070
from what you want in life.

791
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,070
He said to have wives instead.

792
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,170
You can leave wives.

793
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,570
You can't leave your own kids.

794
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:34,070
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.

795
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,369
My son came out of me

796
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,669
perfectly healthy... ten fingers,

797
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:42,817
ten toes, everything works.

798
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,904
I've managed to keep him alive
for 17 years, but

799
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,747
I am not agood mother.

800
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:52,970
I'm sure you are.

801
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,170
Kids are like clients.

802
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,070
They want all of you, all the time.

803
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:10,670
I mean, um, don't get me wrong,

804
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:13,670
I love my son.

805
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,769
Well, that's the main thing.

806
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:17,770
No.

807
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:19,970
Love's nothing, love's easy.

808
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:21,870
They come out of you, you love them.

809
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,970
What you do after that is the hard part.

810
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,620
you know what I like about you?

811
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,370
There's always something going on.

812
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,270
I could see it at your sister's wedding.

813
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:50,170
And you don't fall for bullshit.

814
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:37,770
Patty knows about Katie.

815
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:39,970
You told her?

816
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,370
I didn't have to.

817
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:44,734
I mean, think about it.

818
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:48,169
My future sister-in-law is

819
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:51,431
a potential witness in the biggest
case in Patty's career.

820
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,970
I mean, that's a pretty
big coincidence, isn't it?

821
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:57,682
You think Patty hired
you just to get to Katie?

822
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:44,470
Keep your heels dow, megan.

823
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:48,039
So, you want to know if

824
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,719
Patty knew about your friend
before she hired you?

825
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,526
I know I sound paranoid but

826
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,570
you're the only one I can trust.

827
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:58,870
No, you sound, you sound smart.

828
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:01,670
What?

829
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:04,969
Patty was right about you.

830
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:07,469
You are a force to be reckoned with.

831
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:10,342
In less than 2 weeks, you're already
starting to think like her.

832
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:14,414
Did she only hire me
to deliver her witness?

833
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,521
Personally, I try not to guess

834
00:47:17,522 --> 00:47:20,270
what Patty Hewes does or doesn't know.

835
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,300
And what about you?

836
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,170
Me? Of course not.

837
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:28,420
Today is the first I'm hearing
about your friend.

838
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:34,036
you know, Patty didn't even know
who you were until I briefed her.

839
00:47:34,495 --> 00:47:36,695
Then she read your resume,
met you at the wedding,

840
00:47:36,696 --> 00:47:38,267
and in ten years,

841
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:41,170
I've never seen her more
excited about somebody's potential.

842
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:45,170
That's the only reason
she hired you, Ellen.

843
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:47,870
There's no way she...

844
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,650
there's no way she knew about your friend.

845
00:47:49,651 --> 00:47:51,270
Daddy, look at me!

846
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:54,022
Yeah, it's looking good,
looking good, megan!

847
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:57,670
So... what are you going to do?

848
00:48:24,638 --> 00:48:25,670
Thank you.

849
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,470
Here you go.

850
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:28,492
Thanks, dad.

851
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:34,931
Ray, make this quick.

852
00:48:34,932 --> 00:48:37,104
I got a meeting with
the chairman of the board.

853
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,370
We're cooking up something big here.

854
00:48:40,398 --> 00:48:42,970
Patty Hewes has a new associate.

855
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:44,970
So what?

856
00:48:45,353 --> 00:48:47,388
I thought they voted
to accept the settlement.

857
00:48:47,389 --> 00:48:49,187
I haven't gotten the call yet

858
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:50,970
and I'm worried.

859
00:48:51,694 --> 00:48:53,725
The new associate's been
talking to Katie connor.

860
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:55,070
Who?

861
00:48:55,805 --> 00:48:56,870
Our chef.

862
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,670
Ray, whatever it takes... fix this.

863
00:49:20,473 --> 00:49:21,670
Saffron!

864
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:23,165
It doesn't matter what tom said,

865
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:24,369
I don't want Katie involved.

866
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:25,370
David.

867
00:49:25,475 --> 00:49:26,570
Saffron?

868
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,824
Have you heard of vanessa tutto?

869
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,369
- Who?
- The whistleblower in that airlines case.

870
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:33,050
Dateline did a whole thing on her.

871
00:49:33,051 --> 00:49:34,469
Her life turned to shit.

872
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:35,470
Saffron?

873
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,281
David,
if I don't tell Patty about Katie,

874
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:40,140
the clients lose the case.

875
00:49:40,141 --> 00:49:42,769
I'm not sure that you can be totally
objective about this.

876
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:45,687
- What is that supposed to mean?
- That you'll score points with Patty.

877
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:48,670
I would never do any to hurt Katie.

878
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:53,170
Then just keep her out of this!

879
00:50:27,939 --> 00:50:29,030
Did you call the er?

880
00:50:29,128 --> 00:50:31,753
Yeah, they're waiting for us.

881
00:50:33,379 --> 00:50:35,169
Enough of this Katie.

882
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,252
- Just give these guys what they want.
- No!

883
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:39,870
Call Patty.

884
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:46,970
I want to nail Frobisher.

885
00:50:51,191 --> 00:50:52,870
You know what this means?

886
00:50:53,371 --> 00:50:55,305
They're going to keep coming
after her...

887
00:50:55,523 --> 00:50:58,229
personally, legally,
in whatever way they can.

888
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:59,842
Katie understands.

889
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,014
If Frobisher thought this would
shut her up, it's done the opposite.

890
00:51:03,015 --> 00:51:05,570
I want to be very clear with you, Ellen.

891
00:51:06,322 --> 00:51:07,670
This is a big step.

892
00:51:08,715 --> 00:51:09,970
What about the settlement?

893
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:11,969
We'll depose Katie.

894
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:14,920
If she knows something,
we'll get our clients to turn it down.

895
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:17,370
Good.

896
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:18,570
I'm glad.

897
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:20,570
Ellen.

898
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:24,370
I don't take this for granted.

899
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,970
I know how hard it is for you.

900
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,594
Well, if Katie can help the case, then

901
00:51:31,813 --> 00:51:33,481
we're doing the right thing.

902
00:51:34,055 --> 00:51:36,706
I'll do everything in
my power to protect her.

903
00:51:37,731 --> 00:51:38,770
Good.

904
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:17,770
I'm worried.

905
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,270
I know.

906
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:23,770
But we're in good hands.

907
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:26,470
Patty knows what she's doing.

908
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:39,770
You find this place okay, uncle Pete?

909
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:43,002
Hey! I miss seeing
you around the offic, Tommy.

910
00:52:43,576 --> 00:52:45,869
Everyone thinks you were actually canned.

911
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:46,870
Yeah, so did I.

912
00:52:47,608 --> 00:52:48,630
What's this?

913
00:52:48,631 --> 00:52:50,170
A souvenir for Patty.

914
00:52:51,515 --> 00:52:52,770
I'll get it to he, uncle Pete.

915
00:52:52,771 --> 00:52:53,830
Yeah.

916
00:53:12,345 --> 00:53:14,914
Maybe one of these days
I'll stop being impressed.

917
00:53:16,267 --> 00:53:17,853
Ellen figures out

918
00:53:17,854 --> 00:53:20,750
why you hired her, and you still
get her to deliver the witness.

919
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,670
From uncle Pete.

920
00:53:26,022 --> 00:53:27,870
Are you interviewing for a new associate?

921
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:30,270
No, I like Ellen.

922
00:53:31,636 --> 00:53:33,770
I think she's going
to have a brilliant future.

923
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:28,270
Ellen.

924
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:32,870
You'd better start talking.

925
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:43,576
Get me a lawyer.
