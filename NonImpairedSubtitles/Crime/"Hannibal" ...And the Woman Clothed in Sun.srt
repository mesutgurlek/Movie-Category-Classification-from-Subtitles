1
00:00:00,583 --> 00:00:02,374
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,832
I want you to help me, Dr Lecter.
You've read about it.

3
00:00:04,958 --> 00:00:08,249
'This is a very shy boy.
I would love to meet him.'

4
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,582
I'm Francis Dolarhyde.

5
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:13,707
Miss McClane,
can I give you a ride home?

6
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:16,915
'Have you considered
that he may believe he is disfigured?'

7
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:20,790
May I touch your face? I just want
to know if you're smiling or frowning.

8
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:23,499
- I'm smiling.
- 'Hello, Dr Lecter.'

9
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:29,457
'What are you becoming?'
'The Great Red Dragon.'

10
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:36,874
Buh...

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,332
Buh... Buh...

12
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,082
Buh...

13
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,457
Buh... Buh...

14
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,082
Ruh...

15
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:51,290
Reh... Reh...

16
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,749
Buh... Reh...

17
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,957
Meh... Keh...

18
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,749
'Baltimore State Hospital.'

19
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:40,999
Hello. My name is Byron Metcalf.
I'm Hannibal Lecter's lawyer.

20
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,290
- 'One moment please.'
- I'll hold.

21
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,790
'Hello?'

22
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:04,082
Hello... Dr Lecter.

23
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,624
As an avid fan,

24
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:19,874
I wanted to tell you that I'm delighted

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,457
that you have taken an interest in me.

26
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:28,374
I don't believe
you would tell them who I am,

27
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,624
even if you knew.

28
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:36,082
'What particular body
you currently occupy is trivial.'

29
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:42,874
I knew that you alone
would understand this.

30
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:49,165
The important thing is
what I am becoming.

31
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:55,957
'Tell me.
What are you becoming?'

32
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,290
The Great... Red...

33
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,624
Dragon.

34
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,415
I've admired you for years.

35
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:22,582
And I have a complete collection
of your press notices.

36
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,540
Actually,

37
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,832
I think of them as unfair reviews.

38
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,124
As unfair as yours?

39
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,874
They like to sling
demeaning nicknames, don't they?

40
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,707
Tooth Fairy.

41
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,082
What could be more inappropriate?

42
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:53,165
It would shame me
for you to see that,

43
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:58,415
if I didn't know that you have suffered
the same distortions in the press.

44
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,499
You've read Freddie Lounds' latest?

45
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,707
It's not a good picture of you.

46
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,040
Your speech is bent
and pruned by disabilities,

47
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,249
real and imagined, but...

48
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,457
your words are startling.

49
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:27,207
I want to be recognised by you.

50
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,999
As John the Baptist recognised
the one who came after.

51
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,165
I want to sit before you

52
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:41,415
as the Dragon sat
before 666 in Revelation.

53
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,540
I have...

54
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:48,415
things I would love to show you.

55
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:53,957
Someday, if circumstances permit,

56
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,040
I would like to meet you

57
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,874
and watch you... meld

58
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,790
with the strength of the Dragon.

59
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,290
See how magnificent you are.

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,457
"Did he who made the Lamb
make thee?"

61
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:48,332
I awoke in the fresh-smelling semi-dark,

62
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:53,499
knowing in some primal way
that I was near the sea.

63
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:58,499
Day and evening again,

64
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,332
the smell of fresh flowers

65
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:06,165
and the vague awareness
of a needle bleeding into me.

66
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,999
He never called me my name.

67
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,957
That was strange at first.

68
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,290
And then it wasn't strange.

69
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,874
And then...

70
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:26,707
my name was Lydia Fell.

71
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:37,957
Deeply felt truths about myself
as Bedelia Du Maurier

72
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,832
were smoke and mirrors
of the highest order.

73
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:51,665
What we take for granted
about our sense of self,

74
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:56,415
everything we see,
everything we remember,

75
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:03,290
is nothing more
than a construct of the mind.

76
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:12,957
Dante was the first to conceive of Hell
as a planned space,

77
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,665
an urban environment.

78
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:20,665
Before Dante, we spoke not
of the "gates" of Hell

79
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,415
but of the "mouth" of Hell.

80
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,790
My journey to damnation began

81
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:33,290
when I was swallowed by the beast.

82
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,999
Thank you.

83
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,249
Poor Doctor Du Maurier,

84
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,540
swallowed whole,

85
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:59,290
suffering inside Hannibal Lecter's bowels
for what must have felt like an eternity.

86
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,082
You didn't lose yourself.

87
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,582
You just crawled so far up his ass,
you couldn't be bothered.

88
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,957
Hello, Will.

89
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:14,165
You hitched your star to a man
commonly known as a monster.

90
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,290
You're the Bride of Frankenstein.

91
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,165
We've both been his bride.

92
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,832
How did you manage
to walk away unscarred, huh?

93
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,665
I'm covered in scars.

94
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,707
I wasn't myself.

95
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,665
You were.

96
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,957
Even when you weren't, you were.

97
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,290
- I wasn't wearing adequate armour.
- No.

98
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,790
You were naked.

99
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,832
Have you been to see him?

100
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,707
Yes.

101
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,999
You haven't learned your lesson,
have you?

102
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:04,249
Or did you just miss him that much?

103
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,040
Have you been to see him?

104
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,040
I've seen enough of him.

105
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,999
I was with him behind the veil.

106
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,249
You were always on the other side.

107
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,915
Something we should talk about.

108
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,124
You'll have to make an appointment.

109
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,249
We're at the zoo.

110
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,874
Why are we at the zoo?
It's cold for the zoo.

111
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:02,207
Did you ever see a tiger?

112
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,207
No.

113
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,582
They're working on its tooth

114
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,874
and they have to put him to sleep.

115
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,290
If you want, you can touch him.

116
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,040
You wanna do it?

117
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,207
It's in here.

118
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,874
How do I know he's sound asleep?

119
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,457
Tickle him.

120
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,082
Do you have
a general impression?

121
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,040
I can describe as much as you like.

122
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,457
Put your left hand
on the edge of the table.

123
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,415
You can explore with your right.
Take your time.

124
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,665
D?

125
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:26,040
I'd like you to tell me what you see,
if you don't mind.

126
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,707
He's striking.

127
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,290
Orange and black stripes.

128
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,665
The orange is so bright,

129
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,832
it's almost bleeding
into the air around him.

130
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,040
It's radiant.

131
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,040
I'm right here with you.

132
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,082
That was a very elegant gesture.

133
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,790
Eloquent, too.

134
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,707
Maybe the most eloquent thing
I ever heard of.

135
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,582
That tiger, this house...

136
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,790
You're full of surprises, D.

137
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,415
I don't think anyone at Gateway
knows you at all.

138
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,290
- Did you ask them?
- No.

139
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,582
Then how do you know
nobody knows me?

140
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:28,374
Because they wonder about you.
They wonder about everything.

141
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,957
They find you very mysterious.

142
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,457
Did they tell you how I look?

143
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,999
I didn't ask them.

144
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,457
But, yes, they told me.

145
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:54,124
Do you want to hear it?
Don't ask if you don't.

146
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,249
I think I'll tell you.

147
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:13,915
They said you have
a kind of hard, clean...

148
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,790
...neatness that they like.

149
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,499
They say you're very sensitive
about your face,

150
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,374
and that you shouldn't be.

151
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,957
Where the hell are you?

152
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,290
Ah.

153
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,832
Here you are.

154
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,790
Do you want to know
what I think?

155
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,874
I hope I didn't shock you.

156
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,624
That's so sweet.

157
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,165
Good morning.

158
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,082
Good morning.

159
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,582
I really had a terrific time, D.

160
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,415
Good.

161
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,165
Me too.

162
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:22,082
But I need to go home now.

163
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,457
Yes.

164
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,915
Good.

165
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,290
I'll take you now.

166
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,582
Go behind your work table.

167
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,665
If you approach the barrier
before you hear the lock snap,

168
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:51,165
I'll mace you in the face,
understand?

169
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,832
Yes, indeed.

170
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,082
Thank you so much, Denise.

171
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,082
- 'Are you ready for your call?'
- Yes, please.

172
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:30,790
'You've reached
the offices of Byron...

173
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:40,999
'Operator.'

174
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,332
Operator, I don't have
the use of my hands.

175
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:47,915
Could you please ring
667-JL5-0102?

176
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:50,749
- 'Of course. Have a nice day.'
- Thank you.

177
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:57,874
- 'Dr Frederick Chilton's office.'
- Is this Linda?

178
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,124
'Linda doesn't come in on weekends.'

179
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,665
Maybe you could help me,
if you don't mind.

180
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:06,957
This is Bob Greer
at Blaine & Edwards Publishing.

181
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:10,457
Dr Chilton asked me
to send his book to someone

182
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:14,957
and Linda was supposed to give me
the address but she never did.

183
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,040
'She'll be in on Monday.'

184
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:20,665
I have to catch Federal Express
in about five minutes

185
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:23,332
and I don't want
to bother Frederick at home.

186
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:25,499
It's right there in his contacts.

187
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:30,165
I'll dance at your wedding,
if you'll read it to me.

188
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:31,749
'I'm opening the file.'

189
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:34,957
Be a darling and slide the cursor
down to the letter G.

190
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,332
Give it a click
and I'll be out of your hair.

191
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:39,665
'All right.
What was the name?'

192
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:40,999
Graham.

193
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,874
Will Graham.

194
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:55,374
'Have you had
any contact with him?'

195
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:01,374
'He sends me greeting cards
on Christian holidays and my birthday.

196
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,624
'He always includes a recipe.'

197
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:10,624
If he does end up eating you, Bedelia,
you'd have it coming.

198
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:17,832
I can't blame him for doing
what evolution has equipped him to do.

199
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:23,457
If we just do whatever
evolution equipped us to do,

200
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:28,165
murder and cannibalism
are morally acceptable.

201
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:30,332
They are acceptable,

202
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:33,165
to murderers and cannibals.

203
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,665
And you.

204
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:36,082
And you.

205
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:41,790
You lied, Bedelia.

206
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:46,124
You do that a lot.

207
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:49,290
Why do you do that a lot?

208
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,874
I obfuscate.

209
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:59,082
Hannibal was never not my patient.

210
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:04,999
Covert treatment suffers secrecy

211
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,707
and disapproval.

212
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:13,749
Covert because Hannibal was
an uncooperative patient?

213
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:17,457
Covert because I was
a cooperative psychiatrist.

214
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,249
"Do no harm."

215
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,999
And did you?

216
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,790
I did.

217
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,582
Technically.

218
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:34,999
You dared to care.

219
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:43,665
Not the first time
I've lost professional objectivity

220
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:46,499
in a matter where Hannibal is concerned.

221
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:52,165
What did he tell you?

222
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:55,832
What do you think he told me?

223
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,957
I think he told you that I'm paranoid.

224
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,707
- Are you?
- Yes.

225
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:08,207
But that's not to suggest
I don't have good reason to be.

226
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,332
You don't trust Dr Lecter?

227
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:15,499
There's something wrong
with Dr Lecter.

228
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:19,249
Did you think that way before he ended
the doctor-patient relationship?

229
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:21,124
It's why he ended it.

230
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,165
He knew I knew.

231
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:26,707
I went to him mildly depressed,
had trouble sleeping.

232
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:30,957
I ended up wildly depressed,
not sleeping at all.

233
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:34,290
You believe your condition worsened
under Dr Lecter's care?

234
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:36,624
Care?

235
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,415
He told me to eat more red meat
and wrote a prescription.

236
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:46,165
And have you been taking
the medication he prescribed?

237
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,582
Hell, no.

238
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:52,165
He wanted to administer phototherapy

239
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:55,499
to advance my circadian rhythms,
help me sleep,

240
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,165
but it wasn't phototherapy.

241
00:28:57,291 --> 00:29:00,707
He stuck me in front of a light
and I woke up somewhere else.

242
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:04,832
Dr Lecter told me you had
a seizure response to phototherapy.

243
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:06,915
No, he did something to me.

244
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:14,374
You experienced a traumatic event
that you now associate with Dr Lecter.

245
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,832
I nearly choked on my own tongue
and he remained indifferent.

246
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:26,374
How is one patient worthy of compassion
and another not?

247
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:31,082
I'm under no illusions

248
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:34,707
how morally consistent
my compassion has been.

249
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:42,207
How is one murderer worthy
of compassion and not another?

250
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:48,915
All that time you were with Hannibal,

251
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:50,624
behind the veil,

252
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,374
you'd already killed one patient.

253
00:29:57,916 --> 00:30:00,040
Did it ever occur to you
to kill another?

254
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:07,374
My relationship with Hannibal
is not as passionate as yours.

255
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:13,207
You are here, visiting an old flame.

256
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:20,499
Is your wife aware

257
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:24,165
of how intimately
you and Hannibal know each other?

258
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,582
She's aware enough.

259
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:35,999
You couldn't save Hannibal.

260
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:41,082
Do you think you can save
this new one?

261
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:49,624
Your experience of Hannibal's attention
is so profoundly harmful,

262
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:54,082
yet so irresistible...

263
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:59,999
it undermines your ability
to think rationally.

264
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,790
I am thinking rationally.

265
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:05,290
You've made some
very serious accusations.

266
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:07,124
Actionable accusations?

267
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:10,249
- Yes.
- And have you?

268
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:13,665
- Taken action?
- Is that what you want me to do?

269
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:17,707
Isn't that what you're supposed to do
on my behalf? And you haven't.

270
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:22,832
I am not firmly convinced
it would be in your best interest.

271
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:26,624
I am not firmly convinced you give
a rat's ass about my best interests!

272
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,249
Do you believe me?

273
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:34,957
I believe you are experiencing
a lack of insight.

274
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:40,040
I am trying to assist you
in regaining enough insight

275
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:42,665
that you realise
that you require medication.

276
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:49,915
What medication would you prescribe,
Dr Du Maurier?

277
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:55,624
I would prescribe exactly the medication
Dr Lecter prescribed and you refused.

278
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,457
You know, whatever this is,

279
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:02,290
whatever this is, this is why
Scientologists hate psychiatry.

280
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:09,124
What do you think this is?

281
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,290
Of course he would refer me to you!

282
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:15,124
You're just as twisted as he is.

283
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:20,165
You're walking down the street

284
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:23,624
and you see
a wounded bird in the grass.

285
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,999
What's your first thought?

286
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,707
It's vulnerable,

287
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:34,290
I want to help it.

288
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,874
My first thought is also
that it's vulnerable.

289
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:45,082
And yet...

290
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:47,957
I want to crush it.

291
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:56,499
A primal rejection of weakness
which is every bit as natural

292
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:58,707
as the nurturing instinct.

293
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:04,457
Of course, I wouldn't crush it.

294
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,832
But my first thought is to do just that.

295
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:11,874
You know, I gave up free will.

296
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,874
I continue to act and feel
as though I have it, but I don't.

297
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,457
The only reason I'm here is
it was prescribed.

298
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:20,749
- Neil, sit down.
- No! No!

299
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:23,124
This is culty and weird.

300
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:49,665
Let me help you.

301
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:52,290
I'm trying to clear your airway.

302
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:32,332
One thing I learned from Hannibal

303
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:35,165
is the alchemy of lies and truths.

304
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:40,457
It's how he convinced you
you're a killer.

305
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:46,249
You're not convinced?

306
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,249
You're not a killer.

307
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:54,082
You're capable of righteous violence

308
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:56,290
because you are compassionate.

309
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:02,415
How are you capable?

310
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:07,624
Extreme acts of cruelty require...

311
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,957
a high level of empathy.

312
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,665
The next time you have
an instinct to help someone,

313
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:23,415
you might consider
crushing them instead.

314
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,290
It might save you
a great deal of trouble.

315
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:51,207
It was done carefully and cleanly
with a very sharp knife.

316
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,374
It was not the work of a child.

317
00:35:57,125 --> 00:36:00,040
It's a Chinese character
which means "you hit it",

318
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:03,582
an expression
sometimes used in gambling.

319
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:06,082
A lucky sign.

320
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,707
The character also appears
on a mah-jong tile.

321
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:14,290
It marks the red dragon.

322
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:21,082
"And behold a great red dragon."

323
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:26,457
Are you familiar with William Blake's

324
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:29,457
"The Great Red Dragon
and the Woman Clothed in Sun"?

325
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,832
Blake's Dragon stands
over a pleading woman

326
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,040
caught in the coil of its tail.

327
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:40,499
Few images in Western art

328
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:43,374
radiate such a unique and...

329
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,582
nightmarish charge
of demonic sexuality.

330
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:55,249
The man who killed
the Jacobis and the Leedses

331
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:58,832
saw something in them that
drew him and drove him to do it.

332
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:01,165
He chose them,

333
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:04,249
because something in them
spoke to him.

334
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,582
The Jacobis were the first to help him,

335
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:13,624
the first to lift him
into the glory of his becoming.

336
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:17,165
The Jacobis were better
than anything he knew.

337
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:19,499
Until the Leedses.

338
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:22,165
As the Dragon grows
in strength and glory,

339
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:24,040
there are families to come.

340
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:30,290
I have to believe
there is a common factor

341
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:36,082
and we will find it... soon.

342
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:39,040
Otherwise you have
to enter more houses

343
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:41,707
and see what
the Dragon has left for you.

344
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,999
Eleven days till the next full moon.

345
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:47,374
Tick-tock.

346
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:54,124
I like this Dragon, Will.
I don't think he's crazy at all.

347
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:00,415
I think he might be quite sane.

348
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,290
A magnificent thing

349
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:10,374
to watch the world
through his red haze.

350
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:27,249
Sign the register, please.

351
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:33,290
Painting study, Miss Harper.

352
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,832
Mr Crane? I'm Paula Harper.

353
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:50,124
You called about
the Blake watercolour.

354
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,582
Come with me, I'll show it to you.
You'll need this.

355
00:38:56,791 --> 00:39:00,040
The museum is closed
to the general public on Tuesdays,

356
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:04,665
but art classes
and researchers are admitted.

357
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:06,915
May I ask what you're researching?

358
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:08,957
A paper on Butts.

359
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:10,915
On Thomas Butts?

360
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:14,874
You only see him in footnotes
as a patron of Blake's.

361
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:21,165
- Is he interesting?
- I'm just beginning.

362
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:27,040
We have to keep it in this box
because light will fade it.

363
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:29,332
That's why it's not on display often.

364
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:31,499
You're not allowed to touch it.

365
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:35,165
I'll display it for you.
That's the rule. OK?

366
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,915
Isn't it stunning?

367
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:44,207
Even the best reproductions
can't possibly do the colours justice.

368
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,499
It appears he used chalk as well as...

369
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:04,165
It's just this way, Mr Graham.

370
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:07,957
You know, you're the second person
who's asked to see the Blake today.

371
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:21,999
Wait here.

372
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:25,290
Paula, I have another visitor
for the Great Red Dragon.

373
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:29,374
Paula?
