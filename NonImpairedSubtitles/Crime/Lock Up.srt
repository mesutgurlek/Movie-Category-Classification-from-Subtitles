1
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:23,246
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

2
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:28,148
I'm looking for a mechanic.
Anybody here fit that description?

3
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,655
I might be able to help you.
What do you need?

4
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:36,353
I need it fixed right away. I need
someone who knows what they're doing.

5
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:39,192
I'm not that busy.
So, what's the problem?

6
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:44,200
I'm not sure. Maybe you ought to
get under the hood and check it out.

7
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,537
Yeah, maybe I better.

8
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,041
Looks okay from here.

9
00:02:58,286 --> 00:03:00,914
Great customer service.

10
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:05,416
Little bit of cleaning,
little bit of paint...

11
00:03:05,626 --> 00:03:08,288
...this place will be ready
for business.

12
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:11,488
About time for me to play
in the Super Bowl.

13
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:14,691
Those guys are gonna take you apart.

14
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:20,569
Okay, we're gonna do it this time!
Ready?

15
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:24,709
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah!

16
00:03:27,882 --> 00:03:29,509
Hike!

17
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:36,622
To the left. You can do it. Cut back.

18
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,453
Here it comes.

19
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:49,335
All right!

20
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:55,807
Okay, suckers walk. Suckers walk.

21
00:03:56,043 --> 00:04:00,309
Hey. Hey, suckers walk.
Go on. Suckers walk. Come on.

22
00:04:00,548 --> 00:04:02,607
Suckers walk!

23
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:10,190
- Hey, Frankie, what's that mean?
- It means everything's okay.

24
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:12,886
So how do you think I did?

25
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:15,721
Pretty good with the sixth graders.

26
00:04:15,997 --> 00:04:19,763
You really know how to make a guy
feel great, you know that?

27
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:24,362
What's the matter?
We don't look too happy today?

28
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:27,264
I'm missing you already.

29
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:30,033
Pretty soon you'll be so sick
of seeing me...

30
00:04:30,278 --> 00:04:33,577
...you'll pray to have some time
on your own. You know that?

31
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:36,682
- I don't believe you.
- Yeah, believe it.

32
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:42,286
Now that's Italian.

33
00:04:45,793 --> 00:04:47,556
- I gotta go.
- No. No.

34
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:50,355
- I gotta go. Yes. Yes.
- No. No.

35
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:55,535
So I'm not so good against 10-year-olds?
I should try a different sport?

36
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:56,896
Yeah, golf.

37
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:58,799
- Golf?
- Yeah.

38
00:04:59,073 --> 00:05:02,702
- Wanna see my swing?
- I'd like to see you in whites.

39
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:07,072
- Some swing.
- You see me on the golf course?

40
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:12,311
You're lucky I have a sense of humour.
I would take that personal.

41
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,906
Time to go to work.

42
00:05:40,147 --> 00:05:42,342
- All right, be good.
- Bye.

43
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,814
Wait a minute.

44
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:49,318
I got something for you.

45
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:51,755
What's this?

46
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,450
It's supposed to bring you luck.

47
00:05:57,164 --> 00:05:59,257
It's nice.

48
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:02,360
Thanks.

49
00:06:04,138 --> 00:06:06,231
I could use it.

50
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,550
- How'd it go, Frank? Good furlough?
- The best.

51
00:06:25,793 --> 00:06:28,853
- Did you see that game?
- I have to admit, I missed it.

52
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:30,690
- It was awesome.
- Was it?

53
00:06:30,898 --> 00:06:34,356
- Yes. You missed a good one.
- I missed a good one?

54
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:39,403
- I had more fun than you this weekend.
- I bet you did.

55
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:43,867
Here you go, Roger.

56
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:48,707
- How's the diesel running, Jimmy?
- Forget it. It stops, it stalls.

57
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:52,043
- It don't go.
- You got water in the fuel line.

58
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:54,346
Open your mouth.

59
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:56,648
- You sure?
- I'd bet time on it.

60
00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:58,518
- Take it off.
- All right.

61
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:03,693
I'll see you later, Jimmy.

62
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:08,064
- I'll give you more starch next time.
- Yeah, do that.

63
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:11,533
Say hi to the wife.
How you doing there, man?

64
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:14,003
Frank! What'd you bring me?

65
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,143
Here you go. Go kill yourself.

66
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,803
- I thought you'd bring me a girl.
- I had one...

67
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:22,949
...but the guards decided to keep her.

68
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:26,847
I can't depend on you.
Let me ask you something else.

69
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:29,420
- Did you go see the garage?
- It's beautiful.

70
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:34,087
- No garage I ever stuck up was beautiful.
- This one is.

71
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:38,731
Can I tell you something?
I'm getting out soon. I don't come cheap.

72
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:42,424
But you know I know my way
around cars. You need help, call me.

73
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:46,868
- I fix them, I don't steal them.
- I was framed.

74
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:49,242
What? I was framed.

75
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:20,301
- What is this, Jimmy?
- I don't know, but it's official.

76
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:41,954
Crack 210.

77
00:08:44,298 --> 00:08:47,825
- On your feet, Leone.
- What do you want?

78
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:50,663
- Take him.
- What are you doing here?

79
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,432
- You're being transferred.
- Transferred where?

80
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:02,616
- That's not necessary.
- Step back! He's in our custody now.

81
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,284
You got the wrong guy!

82
00:09:14,862 --> 00:09:16,420
Transferred where?

83
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:27,372
Talk to me. Where am I going?

84
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,573
- Get in there now!
- Where am I going?

85
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:38,646
Hey!

86
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:40,252
Where are we going?

87
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:43,455
Hey! Talk to me!

88
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,703
Let's go, Leone. Come on!

89
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:33,772
- Get his ass out here!
- Come on, get out!

90
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:38,367
- Where the hell are we? I wanna know!
- Shut up!

91
00:10:38,746 --> 00:10:42,147
You got the wrong man!
You made a mistake!

92
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,748
There's no mistake.

93
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,722
Welcome to Gateway, Leone.

94
00:10:53,928 --> 00:10:57,056
- Drumgoole?
- That's Warden Drumgoole, convict.

95
00:10:57,298 --> 00:10:59,562
- Captain.
- Move him!

96
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:00,893
Move your ass!

97
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:04,127
Let's go. Come on!

98
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,672
You'll be issued one bar of soap,
two rolls of toilet paper per month.

99
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:13,539
Somebody steals...
Turn your ass around!

100
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:18,775
Somebody steals them, or you lose
them, wipe your ass with your shirt.

101
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:23,046
You have one uniform.
Your number is 5-1-0. Remember it.

102
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:28,991
This is C-wing. You will eat, shower
and take your yard time with your wing.

103
00:11:29,263 --> 00:11:33,131
There's 6 counts a day. Miss one,
you're in the hole. Miss two...

104
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:36,462
...I will put you in the house of pain.

105
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:39,799
Convict...

106
00:11:40,174 --> 00:11:43,769
...two things.
One: I am Meissner.

107
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:47,208
Two: Never fuck with Meissner.

108
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:49,608
Inside.

109
00:11:55,856 --> 00:11:59,815
- Sir, what about the cuffs?
- Let him get used to them.

110
00:12:10,671 --> 00:12:13,606
You better watch your back, man!

111
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,133
Come on, guys. Let's go.

112
00:13:06,593 --> 00:13:08,652
Nineteen-one.

113
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:19,538
Nineteen-one! Crack it!

114
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,375
Oh, yeah, you better not
eyeball me, boy.

115
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:32,177
How were your accommodations last
night? Like your mama used to do you?

116
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:36,148
- You did his mama, didn't you?
- Twice.

117
00:14:00,914 --> 00:14:02,074
Hey!

118
00:14:02,316 --> 00:14:05,581
Open the door! You hear me?

119
00:14:06,587 --> 00:14:08,578
Hello, Frank.

120
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:14,323
In the old days, the warden would've
come down that private passageway...

121
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:19,556
...to this execution chamber to witness
the putting to death of a criminal.

122
00:14:20,134 --> 00:14:25,436
120 men and 4 women were electrocuted
in that chair before it was retired.

123
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:30,609
Beautiful, isn't it? When I came here,
it was falling apart. I restored it...

124
00:14:30,811 --> 00:14:36,044
...put it back into working order to
remind me of how things ought to be.

125
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:39,376
It's nearly five years since you
escaped from Treadmore.

126
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,954
- Time flies when you're having fun.
- In all my years as warden there...

127
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:48,561
...you're the only one who escaped.
- So I read in the papers.

128
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:51,890
Yes, you did.
You and your lawyer saw to it...

129
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:56,297
...that everything made it
into the papers. The media.

130
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,463
Distorting the facts,
making a criminal into a hero...

131
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:04,975
...and a warden into a criminal.
You took my future away from me.

132
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:10,139
You and those politicians. They sent
you to Norwood. That's a country club.

133
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:14,583
I ended up here in Gateway,
the worst shit-hole in the system.

134
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:17,724
You don't remember, do you?
I asked you.

135
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:20,883
No, I begged you, Drumgoole.
Do you remember that?

136
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:25,691
I had two weeks before I was released.
I asked for one hour to visit...

137
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:29,802
...with that old man before he died.
- I was doing my job.

138
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,495
There's a lot of ways to do your job!

139
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:36,666
You could've given me an escorted leave,
could've had armed guards.

140
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:41,042
You broke the law.
You broke the law, and I was punished!

141
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:46,511
- I got five years. I paid my debt!
- Not to me. But you're going to.

142
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,787
I've only got six months left
on my sentence.

143
00:15:49,957 --> 00:15:53,484
In Gateway,
six months could be a lifetime.

144
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:57,824
This is hard time. You have no rights
here unless I give them to you.

145
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:02,128
You feel no pleasure unless
I tell you you can. This is hell...

146
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,965
...and I'm going to give you
the guided tour.

147
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:13,942
Okay, tough guy. Open your mouth.
Roll your tongue around.

148
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:16,446
You trying to kiss me, huh?

149
00:16:16,617 --> 00:16:18,949
Let me see your ears.

150
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:30,486
What are you looking at, asshole?

151
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:32,859
- You check his nose?
- Checked it.

152
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,796
Good.

153
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:41,765
This is a delousing chamber.
Don't breathe.

154
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:47,073
X ylon-profic gas can be harmful to
your lungs. Stand with your legs apart...

155
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:49,511
...arms out and away from your body.

156
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:54,047
When I tell you, take a deep breath.
Hold it for 30 seconds.

157
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,883
Start now.

158
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:18,309
Ten seconds.

159
00:17:27,988 --> 00:17:32,220
Not yet. He can take more.

160
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:56,376
Braden...

161
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:02,250
...you'll learn that inmates are physically
more capable than you could imagine.

162
00:18:02,422 --> 00:18:05,653
If you underestimate them...

163
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:08,693
...it will cost you dearly.

164
00:18:54,975 --> 00:18:56,909
Watch out for the birds.

165
00:18:57,077 --> 00:19:00,205
- What the hell you doing?
- Sorry.

166
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,280
Yo, Billy, get that weight.

167
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:32,740
Move it, ace. That's my spot.

168
00:19:47,994 --> 00:19:51,930
That's my spot too.

169
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:56,869
- Any spot that isn't yours?
- Nope, they're all mine.

170
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,369
You wanna use it, you gotta pay.

171
00:20:03,877 --> 00:20:06,778
Not so fast, ace.
I'm not gonna gouge you.

172
00:20:06,947 --> 00:20:12,146
That little thing around your neck,
that'll buy you a spot for the day.

173
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,089
- Put a fucking hole in your heart.
- All right, break it up! Break it up!

174
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,726
I said, break it up! Back off!

175
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:24,227
Spread 'em. Back off!

176
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:29,096
- All right, Weber, drop the shank.
- There ain't no shank, Braden.

177
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,902
- All right, let's go.
- You motherfucker!

178
00:20:33,306 --> 00:20:37,470
- Spread 'em, goddamn it.
- You're making a big mistake, asshole.

179
00:20:39,513 --> 00:20:44,212
- You go in the hole for carrying that.
- Where's your witness, your evidence?

180
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:46,284
Well, where is it?

181
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,943
- He saw it.
- He didn't.

182
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:52,649
- You saw him carrying the shank, right?
- I didn't see nothing.

183
00:20:52,826 --> 00:20:58,128
- You're making a bad mistake, Braden.
- Get him the fuck out of here!

184
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:08,704
He would have put that shank in you.
What did you cover for him for?

185
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,935
You got your rules, we got ours.

186
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:32,388
Hey, hey, hey. I do know the face,
and I do know the name.

187
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:36,093
Hey, Frank. Frank Leone, right?
Name's Dallas.

188
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:39,534
I was in Treadmore
right before you busted out.

189
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:43,608
- You were on A-block, weren't you?
- Yeah, I was on A-block.

190
00:21:43,777 --> 00:21:46,746
- Good memory.
- Treadmore doesn't have an A-block.

191
00:21:46,913 --> 00:21:51,941
- Watch your feet.
- Okay, dig it.

192
00:21:52,118 --> 00:21:55,576
Look, look,
I was there on transfer, man.

193
00:21:55,755 --> 00:21:58,417
Less than two hours,
but I know all about you.

194
00:21:58,592 --> 00:22:04,292
- You're looking at a devoted fan.
- D.T.A.

195
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:09,760
D.T.A., okay. What's that, man?

196
00:22:09,936 --> 00:22:14,566
Don't trust anybody.
Words to survive by. Watch your feet.

197
00:22:15,141 --> 00:22:18,406
- D.T.A.
- D.T.A.

198
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:21,945
You gotta trust somebody.
Let me hip you to the joint.

199
00:22:22,115 --> 00:22:26,552
See this fat tub of shit?
That's Manly. His partner's Wiley.

200
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,986
They're sadistic pigs.
They ain't happy unless they hurt you.

201
00:22:31,157 --> 00:22:35,787
I mean, if the warden wants to put
the boot to you, he uses them.

202
00:22:35,962 --> 00:22:40,296
The black dude in the booth
is Captain Meissner.

203
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,967
Now he runs the guards, okay?
He's one bad dude.

204
00:22:44,137 --> 00:22:46,264
We already met. I gotta do my work.

205
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:50,967
Okay. Okay. Cool. Cool, man.

206
00:22:51,878 --> 00:22:54,108
So listen, Frank...

207
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:58,342
...when you decide to make your break,
and I know you will...

208
00:22:58,518 --> 00:23:01,885
...you come talk to me.
You come talk to Dallas.

209
00:23:02,055 --> 00:23:05,491
Okay? Anything you want,
anything you need, man...

210
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:09,254
...I can get it. Anything.
All right? Okay?

211
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:09,496
No way. No damn way!

212
00:23:09,496 --> 00:23:12,124
No way. No damn way!

213
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:16,360
You're always crying about how you
need a man who knows engines.

214
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:18,163
I brought you the man, Homes.

215
00:23:18,338 --> 00:23:22,570
Look, don't "Homes" me.
The only thing you brought is trouble.

216
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:26,212
- Come on, Eclipse.
- I heard all about you, Leone.

217
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:30,406
Whatever is between you and
Drumgoole ain't coming in here.

218
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:36,146
The boys ain't got no problem with me.
I ain't got no problem with the boys.

219
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:42,687
Come on, Eclipse.
You're making me look bad.

220
00:23:42,862 --> 00:23:48,698
- I promised the dude a job. You owe me.
- I don't owe you or nobody nothing.

221
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:53,703
Hey, you! Get your face out of that
motor! Get your face out of there.

222
00:23:53,873 --> 00:23:58,105
You don't know nothing about motors.
Stay away from it! Okay?

223
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:01,246
It's been a while since I've seen
an old 265 small block.

224
00:24:01,414 --> 00:24:05,043
That's the last time
you're gonna see one in this shop.

225
00:24:05,218 --> 00:24:09,746
Come on. Frank, we can work this out.
We're all gentlemen here.

226
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:14,656
It's his place. He knows what he
wants. It's okay. Thanks anyway.

227
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:22,434
Thanks. You made me look beautiful.
I appreciate the endorsement.

228
00:24:22,602 --> 00:24:24,570
Hey, Frank. Hold up, man.

229
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:29,570
You didn't want this job anyway, man.
Greasy fingers, oil on your clothes...

230
00:24:29,743 --> 00:24:35,113
- Don't worry. I'll take care of you.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

231
00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:38,773
- All right?
- Prison joke.

232
00:24:38,952 --> 00:24:42,353
I lost my watch. Why don't you give me
a hand looking for it.

233
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,888
Roll your ass on out of here, man.

234
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:49,722
Officer Vazquez, you ought to
put on a few pounds. You look frail.

235
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:55,732
Frank, I meant what I said. I'm gonna
get you something good, easy, cool.

236
00:24:56,136 --> 00:25:01,130
- You're gonna love it.
- Shut up. Get inside. Shut up. Inside!

237
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,439
Here's your shit from Norwood, Leone.

238
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,617
All right. Lock in!

239
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,896
Problem?

240
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:35,167
No, I got no problems.

241
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,205
I wanna know what's going on.

242
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:46,283
All I know is that he's in
the general population...

243
00:25:46,453 --> 00:25:51,117
I don't give a damn about the general
population! I wanna know about Frank.

244
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:54,351
- I'm not leaving...
- Calm down. He's all right.

245
00:25:54,527 --> 00:25:58,657
He was a model prisoner at Norwood.
Why bring him here?

246
00:25:58,832 --> 00:26:01,699
Routine transfer.

247
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,239
- Hey, Frank?
- What?

248
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,037
Hey, man.

249
00:26:15,515 --> 00:26:19,246
- It's hot in here, man.
- I know. But at least it's easy.

250
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:23,013
I know, man.
I'm sorry, I didn't do too good.

251
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:27,319
Walk with me. I gotta show you
something. It's important.

252
00:26:27,494 --> 00:26:29,962
- No. Here, you try.
- No. Come on, man.

253
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,860
- You'll like it.
- I'm not into hard labour.

254
00:26:33,032 --> 00:26:38,095
- It's cool. It's easy.
- Okay. There. I'm burnt out. Come on.

255
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:40,762
Come on, you're gonna love this.

256
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:44,401
Watch the steam, Frank.

257
00:26:49,015 --> 00:26:52,507
I got these off this old trustee.
He did the plumbing here.

258
00:26:52,685 --> 00:26:56,849
Everybody thought he was a nut.
Doesn't mean he wasn't smart.

259
00:26:57,524 --> 00:27:00,288
- Come on, hurry up.
- All right, cool.

260
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:05,863
The tunnels under every cellblock,
they lead to the steam plant, okay?

261
00:27:06,032 --> 00:27:09,263
I go out across the steam lines.
Dig this.

262
00:27:09,435 --> 00:27:14,429
I shimmy, okay? Across the
steam pipes to the sally port, okay?

263
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:18,941
Over there, there's trucks coming
and going. I wait for my time...

264
00:27:19,245 --> 00:27:24,205
...l'm on a truck that's leaving.
I'm dearly departing Dallas, man. Huh?

265
00:27:25,418 --> 00:27:29,878
You're the doctor. Operate.
I want your professional opinion.

266
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:34,823
Let's run it backwards. I see these
trucks. They stop running at 9:00.

267
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:39,931
At 9:00, the tower guards are at full
staff and all the inmates are awake.

268
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:45,036
Before you go 10 feet, every con in the
joint knows you're gone. And this thing...

269
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,799
...this shimmy?
- Shimmy slide.

270
00:27:47,974 --> 00:27:52,070
You're gonna shimmy slide across
200 yards of steam pipe...

271
00:27:52,245 --> 00:27:54,406
...running at 160 degrees
and get away with it?

272
00:27:54,581 --> 00:27:59,746
You try, they'll change your name from
Departing Dallas to Deep-Fried Dallas.

273
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,954
- Just a thought, man.
- The thought that counts.

274
00:28:07,126 --> 00:28:11,324
- I got a plane to catch. Thanks a lot.
- Hey, Dallas?

275
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:14,095
You got a cigarette?

276
00:28:15,702 --> 00:28:19,069
It's my last one. Here.
Go ahead. Finish that.

277
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:22,697
It ain't much,
but it's the thought that counts, right?

278
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:47,598
Last call. Mess hall, last call.
Mess, coming up.

279
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:55,239
Looks like some delicious garbage
stew. Just like Mom used to make.

280
00:28:55,408 --> 00:28:57,876
That's why I shot her.

281
00:28:58,745 --> 00:29:02,647
- Can I have some gravy, please?
- You want some gravy?

282
00:29:02,815 --> 00:29:05,978
- Here's your gravy.
- You got it all over my food.

283
00:29:06,152 --> 00:29:07,915
- Move!
- What's your problem?

284
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,181
- Nothing. Move it!
- What's that kid's story?

285
00:29:11,357 --> 00:29:12,984
In for murder.

286
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:16,925
Claims he was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

287
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:21,999
Waiting while his buddy bought beer.
Didn't know the guy was packing heat.

288
00:29:22,168 --> 00:29:26,400
Two guys dead. Kid's doing
the Big Bitch now: Double life.

289
00:29:26,572 --> 00:29:30,133
He'll make parole when he's about 400.

290
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:35,179
Move it!
What are you, a slow study or what?

291
00:29:35,348 --> 00:29:36,372
Screw that guy.

292
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,442
So I didn't get a chance
to make the reservation...

293
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,748
...so why don't we get a seat
over there.

294
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:48,186
- What are you doing?
- Taking this.

295
00:29:48,361 --> 00:29:53,264
- Why don't you go take something else?
- I'll throw you through this table.

296
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:55,901
- Want some cake?
- Are you chumping off on me?

297
00:29:56,069 --> 00:29:57,764
- Not hungry. Want this?
- Who are you?

298
00:29:57,937 --> 00:29:59,370
Nobody. Here.

299
00:30:01,307 --> 00:30:06,745
- I'm on a diet. This spot taken?
- Why don't you stand up to that dirtbag?

300
00:30:06,913 --> 00:30:09,814
Shut up.
He just saved you a lot of healing.

301
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:12,448
What's your name?

302
00:30:12,618 --> 00:30:16,213
Why does anybody need a name
in a joint like this?

303
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:18,414
Helps when you get mail.

304
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:22,450
Oh, yeah. I need a name?
They call me Killer.

305
00:30:22,628 --> 00:30:27,463
That's original. Did you think that up,
or did someone give you a hand with it?

306
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:30,796
- I call myself what I want, okay?
- Okay.

307
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,202
Killer, this is Dallas. I'm Frank.
Dallas, what do you think this is here?

308
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,310
- Wanna give me an idea?
- These might be peas.

309
00:30:38,478 --> 00:30:41,413
They might not.
They might be toxic waste.

310
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:43,649
Who cares? It's all crap.

311
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:49,752
- Eat vegetables to grow big and strong.
- Stick your vegetables. Nobody asked.

312
00:30:49,922 --> 00:30:53,756
We got 325 other killers in here.
Most, unlike you, live up to it.

313
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:58,260
Put your leg in the aisle.
Be ready to move.

314
00:30:58,431 --> 00:31:02,128
Hey, nobody tells me
to do nothing, all right?

315
00:31:26,993 --> 00:31:32,932
You always gotta be ready to move first.
You just might make it to first base.

316
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:38,531
First base.
There's a name for him, huh?

317
00:31:47,413 --> 00:31:49,813
- It's good to be outside.
- It's cold.

318
00:31:49,982 --> 00:31:52,917
It's not that bad.
It's good to keep moving.

319
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:58,216
How come you got this up attitude?
How can you be up in this joint?

320
00:31:58,391 --> 00:32:02,851
It's a mindset. Your body has to
be in here, but your brain doesn't.

321
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:06,294
As long as you keep moving,
you don't become a piece of this place.

322
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,559
- What's that, like, guru stuff?
- Yeah.

323
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:12,329
- Maybe I should become a guru.
- You getting sarcastic?

324
00:32:13,206 --> 00:32:15,834
Fucking birds.

325
00:32:17,877 --> 00:32:21,176
Fucking birds don't eat in the rain.

326
00:32:21,347 --> 00:32:27,115
- Yeah, well, they'll come back.
- You save your bread for me tomorrow?

327
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,118
Yeah, sure.
Put that on your list, okay?

328
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,416
Thanks.

329
00:32:32,592 --> 00:32:36,084
Why you talking crazy, man?
It's a waste of time.

330
00:32:36,262 --> 00:32:39,129
To you, it's a waste.
To him, it's all he's got.

331
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,631
That's more than you got.
In here, you gotta respect that.

332
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:47,636
You don't get much, and what you got,
you gotta protect. You know that?

333
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,367
You don't know nothing yet.
Come on, let's run.

334
00:32:57,717 --> 00:32:59,776
- Come on, Frank.
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.

335
00:32:59,952 --> 00:33:03,911
I'm gonna get wet.
Send you my laundry bills.

336
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:16,367
Feel something, Leone?

337
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,934
Wanna play? They're a man short.

338
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:31,782
Hey! I'm talking to you!

339
00:33:33,152 --> 00:33:38,488
Hey, punk! When you gonna paint your
nails and answer to the name "bitch"?

340
00:33:39,292 --> 00:33:45,697
- You got a big mouth. Keep it shut.
- You fucker, I'll tear your ass off!

341
00:33:46,132 --> 00:33:50,796
You wanna play? We'll play.
You talk too much. Let's play.

342
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:55,907
Goddamn right we'll play. You
and I'll play later, you little fuck.

343
00:34:09,155 --> 00:34:15,151
You want more, Leone? We got more
for you. Come on. Come on.

344
00:34:18,331 --> 00:34:20,822
- Stay down!
- That's a cheap shot!

345
00:34:25,738 --> 00:34:30,232
- What kind of game is this?
- This ain't no game. This is a lesson.

346
00:34:49,762 --> 00:34:51,389
- Got something to say?
- Yeah.

347
00:34:51,564 --> 00:34:53,532
- Say it! Say it!
- First down!

348
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:58,193
Fuck you. That's your last one!
You're dead, Leone!

349
00:34:58,371 --> 00:35:01,670
You'll never last the fucking game!

350
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:19,917
Get in there, hit him.
Come on, get in there.

351
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,623
Set!

352
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:27,289
Hut-one. Hut-two. Hut-three.

353
00:35:49,422 --> 00:35:51,913
I'll beat you up, man.

354
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:05,896
Frank!

355
00:36:19,085 --> 00:36:21,485
Hut-one. Hut-two. Hut-three.

356
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:38,765
Fuck up! Get over on that other team.
That's who you're playing for anyway.

357
00:36:44,009 --> 00:36:47,376
- What took you so long?
- You need the help...

358
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,879
...and I need the exercise.
So call the play.

359
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,213
You're dead, Leone!

360
00:37:09,535 --> 00:37:14,302
- Shit, what hit me?
- F-train, son. F-train.

361
00:37:26,152 --> 00:37:29,144
Don't lay down on me now. Come on.

362
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,719
Come on, Leone.
Come on, you son of a bitch!

363
00:37:35,895 --> 00:37:38,659
All right,
I'm going over tackle on two.

364
00:37:38,831 --> 00:37:40,059
All right, Frank!

365
00:37:40,566 --> 00:37:41,726
Ready.

366
00:37:45,271 --> 00:37:46,568
Set.

367
00:37:46,872 --> 00:37:47,930
You're dead!

368
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,932
Hut-one.

369
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:52,738
Hut-two.

370
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,141
Go, baby!

371
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:04,347
Come on, Frank!

372
00:38:19,405 --> 00:38:21,430
We did it!

373
00:38:47,132 --> 00:38:49,760
Hey, come on Wiley. Come on, man!

374
00:38:51,837 --> 00:38:56,274
Next time I want, you give.

375
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:11,088
Move it. Out. The game is over.
Let's go. You don't listen, do you?

376
00:39:11,991 --> 00:39:16,087
- You okay? Come on. Come on.
- Put him down!

377
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:21,723
You ain't no doctor. He's on his own.
Get inside.

378
00:39:26,472 --> 00:39:29,134
Real badass, huh?

379
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:32,635
See you inside, Leone.

380
00:39:33,646 --> 00:39:39,949
Count time, 10 minutes. All inmates
will return to their wings for count.

381
00:39:46,191 --> 00:39:48,159
Let's go, men!

382
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:35,735
You won't break me.

383
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:05,063
Still interested in the job?

384
00:41:08,073 --> 00:41:09,267
Yeah, I am.

385
00:41:27,926 --> 00:41:31,453
You sure know your way around
an engine. Who taught you?

386
00:41:32,097 --> 00:41:35,430
This old man named Galleti.

387
00:41:35,601 --> 00:41:38,092
Took me off the street
when I was 14.

388
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:41,865
Taught me that I could do something
besides hanging out on corners.

389
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:46,239
- Where is everybody?
- It's quitting time.

390
00:41:46,412 --> 00:41:49,643
- Is that who you broke out for?
- Yeah. I owed him.

391
00:41:49,815 --> 00:41:53,751
Tell me, what put you in the joint
in the first place?

392
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:57,946
One night these punks broke into the
garage and put a beating on Galleti.

393
00:41:58,123 --> 00:42:01,149
The whole neighbourhood knew about it.
The cops knew.

394
00:42:01,326 --> 00:42:06,161
But these punks were connected,
so the cops didn't do anything. I did.

395
00:42:06,331 --> 00:42:08,595
So after all the smoke had cleared...

396
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:14,171
...these guys were in the hospital, and I
was doing time for aggravated assault.

397
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,542
- Care to join me in a little contraband?
- Why not?

398
00:42:20,479 --> 00:42:23,141
I can see why they call you Eclipse.

399
00:42:23,348 --> 00:42:26,909
- I do block a lot of sun, don't I?
- That you do.

400
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:32,319
I had a guy on the outside that used
to get me good Havanas. Not this crap.

401
00:42:32,491 --> 00:42:35,119
But someday... Someday.

402
00:42:35,294 --> 00:42:37,660
Yeah, someday.

403
00:42:38,363 --> 00:42:41,855
- That's not bad.
- At least they're cheap.

404
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:48,031
Eclipse, what do you
got hiding back there?

405
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:50,372
That's my baby.

406
00:42:53,712 --> 00:42:57,842
- Good bodywork.
- Call this here vehicle Maybelline.

407
00:42:58,016 --> 00:43:00,450
- Hello, Maybelline.
- This is my baby.

408
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,143
Nice.

409
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,853
There it is. '65 Ford Mustang V8.

410
00:43:08,026 --> 00:43:10,824
Two eighty-nine, with 225 horsepower.

411
00:43:10,996 --> 00:43:14,659
- When did you last turn her over?
- She's been dead for 15 years.

412
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:20,066
Couple guys tried to get her going
and couldn't. I'm a body man myself.

413
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:23,231
- Mind if I give it a try?
- It's a dead issue.

414
00:43:25,711 --> 00:43:28,874
Nothing's dead around here
until it's buried.

415
00:43:33,218 --> 00:43:35,846
Save the headstone, man.

416
00:43:36,054 --> 00:43:38,887
Easy, easy...

417
00:46:10,942 --> 00:46:15,504
Eclipse. Nothing's dead till
it's buried. Did I tell you that?

418
00:46:19,551 --> 00:46:21,746
I love it!

419
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:23,422
- A toast. Let's do the poem, all right?
- What poem?

420
00:46:23,422 --> 00:46:26,914
- A toast. Let's do the poem, all right?
- What poem?

421
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:30,253
- The poem.
- It's a jailhouse poem.

422
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:32,920
- Something we all wrote.
- Excuse me.

423
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:39,093
When we're in a sober mood
We worry, work and think

424
00:46:39,271 --> 00:46:43,264
When we're in a drunken mood
We gamble, play and drink

425
00:46:43,442 --> 00:46:47,572
But when our moods are over
When our time has come to pass

426
00:46:47,746 --> 00:46:52,683
We hope they bury us upside down
So the warden can kiss our ass

427
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,785
- Amen!
- I like that.

428
00:46:54,953 --> 00:46:57,820
- You like that, huh?
- It's a little catchy.

429
00:46:59,925 --> 00:47:03,417
This is the best.
I mean, this is good, man.

430
00:47:03,595 --> 00:47:06,393
- What's wrong, man?
- Nothing.

431
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:12,602
I wouldn't smoke around this, but
it tastes as good as any dollar wine.

432
00:47:12,771 --> 00:47:14,796
Check, please.

433
00:47:15,907 --> 00:47:18,637
Wait.
When my moods are over

434
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,472
And my...
That's not it. Wait a minute.

435
00:47:23,115 --> 00:47:26,346
You married,
or thinking about it, or what?

436
00:47:26,518 --> 00:47:29,919
Are you proposing to me?
You're not my type.

437
00:47:30,088 --> 00:47:32,318
- No, I'm not married.
- Not married?

438
00:47:32,491 --> 00:47:38,589
- Plan to get married when you get out?
- Yeah, that's the plan.

439
00:47:38,764 --> 00:47:43,167
- You know, I had this really nice girl.
- Yeah?

440
00:47:43,335 --> 00:47:45,997
She was nice. And we were in love.

441
00:47:46,471 --> 00:47:49,770
And we started talking
about getting married.

442
00:47:49,941 --> 00:47:54,105
She's got three brothers, like,
about 1 percent retarded, these guys.

443
00:47:54,279 --> 00:47:56,304
They throw a beating on me.

444
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,478
Some guys don't appreciate romance.

445
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:01,983
Don't take it personal.

446
00:48:02,154 --> 00:48:06,784
She wrote me for a while.
Then it just stopped.

447
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:11,986
That's when it hit me: I ain't
ever gonna be with a girl again.

448
00:48:12,164 --> 00:48:16,658
I'm gonna end up like Eclipse,
kissing pictures in magazines.

449
00:48:16,835 --> 00:48:19,804
There's so many things I ain't done.

450
00:48:19,971 --> 00:48:23,668
- I ain't never learned how to drive.
- What?

451
00:48:23,842 --> 00:48:26,902
I ain't never learned
how to drive a car.

452
00:48:29,848 --> 00:48:34,342
I hope we don't get a speeding ticket.
I'd hate to end up in jail.

453
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:39,786
Don't be a wise guy. You wanna learn
to drive? This is the best I can do.

454
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:44,156
Okay. Now cut it sharp.
That's it. All right.

455
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:49,357
Hang a left on 42nd Street. We'll go
to Broadway and check out the action.

456
00:48:49,534 --> 00:48:52,196
Broadway?
We're doing circles in a garage.

457
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:55,362
Come on, First,
work here with me, okay?

458
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,532
You wanna stay here
or check out the action?

459
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:01,406
I wanna check out the action,
of course.

460
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:05,047
- Turn left on 42nd Street.
- I got it.

461
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:09,378
Look, the place is jumping.
Look at the action here!

462
00:49:09,554 --> 00:49:13,957
Check out those ladies!
Wanna come for a ride in my new car?

463
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:16,525
- Hey, baby!
- They ain't responding.

464
00:49:16,695 --> 00:49:20,392
They're not your type.
When were you last in Atlantic City?

465
00:49:20,565 --> 00:49:24,057
- I ain't never been there.
- You are now. What do you think?

466
00:49:24,236 --> 00:49:29,071
- I don't know. What does it resemble?
- It's the best. Look at the lights.

467
00:49:29,241 --> 00:49:32,404
The Boardwalk
is jumping day and night.

468
00:49:32,644 --> 00:49:36,478
It's hot music. You got high rollers.
You got parties.

469
00:49:36,648 --> 00:49:41,347
You got money. You got gambling.
You got 10,000 chorus girls!

470
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,786
Hey, baby, wanna come for a ride
in my new vehicle?

471
00:49:45,957 --> 00:49:47,925
Man. Yo, that was great, man.

472
00:49:48,093 --> 00:49:52,291
I hate to tell you, your engine just blew
a rod. You're ready for Indianapolis.

473
00:49:52,464 --> 00:49:54,056
You got the touch.

474
00:49:54,232 --> 00:49:56,723
Frank, let me ask you one favour, man.

475
00:49:56,902 --> 00:49:59,496
I appreciate the drive
and everything...

476
00:49:59,671 --> 00:50:03,607
...but none of this is real unless I
hear this engine kick over just once.

477
00:50:03,775 --> 00:50:08,075
If I turn the engine on, the guards
will bust in here and grab us...

478
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,249
...and throw us in the hole forever.
Forget it.

479
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:15,284
Come on, Frank. Just for 10 seconds.
It'll last for the rest of my life.

480
00:50:15,453 --> 00:50:18,320
You're such a pain in the ass.

481
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:24,895
Come on, Frank. Let me just
hear that engine. We built it, man.

482
00:50:27,198 --> 00:50:30,531
All right, go on. Ten seconds.

483
00:50:32,604 --> 00:50:36,096
Yeah! All right, looking good!

484
00:50:36,541 --> 00:50:39,704
- Ain't that great?
- It's beautiful, baby.

485
00:50:39,878 --> 00:50:41,641
Hit it, one time!

486
00:50:41,813 --> 00:50:43,713
All right, one more time.

487
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,008
Damn it, Frank.

488
00:50:46,184 --> 00:50:50,450
Okay, turn it off.
You got it, you did it. Turn it off.

489
00:50:51,056 --> 00:50:53,422
Hey, kill it, Frank. Come on, man.

490
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,152
Come on, First. Turn it off.

491
00:50:56,328 --> 00:51:00,424
If I turn it off I ain't never
gonna turn it on again, right?

492
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,624
That's right.

493
00:51:02,801 --> 00:51:05,861
Please, turn it off, First.

494
00:51:06,037 --> 00:51:08,665
- First!
- Sorry, Frank.

495
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,864
Oh, shit!

496
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:12,566
Frank, turn it off
and get him out of that car.

497
00:51:12,744 --> 00:51:14,371
Get him out!

498
00:51:14,546 --> 00:51:16,377
Frank, get on that kid.

499
00:51:16,548 --> 00:51:18,709
Stop that kid!

500
00:51:22,887 --> 00:51:24,445
Look out!

501
00:51:39,104 --> 00:51:41,095
First! First!

502
00:51:41,272 --> 00:51:44,503
First, turn it off, you crazy bastard!

503
00:51:49,047 --> 00:51:51,208
All right, stop that car now.

504
00:51:51,383 --> 00:51:54,978
I repeat, stop that car now!

505
00:51:59,257 --> 00:52:01,589
They're gonna kill you!

506
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,558
- This is Meissner. Stop firing.
- The warden said...

507
00:52:09,734 --> 00:52:13,226
- Goddamn it, I said stop firing!
- Hold it, hold it.

508
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:19,443
First, turn it off! Hold it. Hold it.

509
00:52:21,446 --> 00:52:25,280
Look out! Look out, Frank.
Look out, man!

510
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:28,942
Get out of the car!
They're gonna kill your ass.

511
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,418
- Did you see that ride?
- Are you crazy?

512
00:52:31,589 --> 00:52:35,081
- It's beautiful. I can drive.
- It's beautiful...

513
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:39,162
All right. You're one crazy
son of a bitch, you know that?

514
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,623
Move!

515
00:52:45,403 --> 00:52:50,739
- You bought yourself a trip to the hole.
- Leave Frank alone!

516
00:52:52,677 --> 00:52:56,169
Let's go, let's go. Break it up!
Break it up! Let's go.

517
00:52:56,347 --> 00:53:00,249
Let him go. You have the wrong man.

518
00:53:00,685 --> 00:53:02,619
- Take Leone to the hole.
- Back off.

519
00:53:02,787 --> 00:53:05,347
- Six weeks.
- It was my fault, sir!

520
00:53:05,523 --> 00:53:06,649
Save it.

521
00:53:06,825 --> 00:53:09,055
Get off me.

522
00:53:10,361 --> 00:53:12,295
Captain?

523
00:53:12,464 --> 00:53:17,629
I want five inmates. Give me a bat.
I wanna break up this car.

524
00:53:17,802 --> 00:53:20,669
Hold it right there, now!

525
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:24,802
I want you to watch this, Leone.

526
00:54:33,912 --> 00:54:36,710
Back to the honeymoon suite!

527
00:54:42,353 --> 00:54:44,184
Night.

528
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:50,953
- You should've been notified...
- Why is he in isolation?

529
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:53,756
- I don't have that information.
- You don't have it?

530
00:54:53,932 --> 00:54:56,594
Then I wanna see
the goddamn warden!

531
00:54:56,768 --> 00:54:58,201
Not today.

532
00:54:59,304 --> 00:55:02,740
Every hour when the light comes on,
you'll stand, face the camera...

533
00:55:02,907 --> 00:55:05,239
...and state your name and number.

534
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:07,435
Name and number!

535
00:55:07,612 --> 00:55:09,239
Leone, five-ten.

536
00:55:09,414 --> 00:55:11,382
Face the camera.

537
00:55:11,549 --> 00:55:13,915
Name and number.

538
00:55:15,086 --> 00:55:17,714
Leone, five-ten.

539
00:55:28,633 --> 00:55:30,931
Name and number.

540
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:35,237
Leone, five-ten.

541
00:55:35,406 --> 00:55:36,839
Leone, five-ten.

542
00:55:37,008 --> 00:55:39,636
Leone. Leone. Leone.

543
00:55:42,013 --> 00:55:43,480
Name and number.

544
00:55:48,419 --> 00:55:52,355
Leone, five-ten.

545
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,761
On your feet. Name and number.

546
00:56:02,867 --> 00:56:06,234
Give Mr. Leone half rations
the rest of his time.

547
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,428
Yes, sir.

548
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:09,431
Name and number!

549
00:56:18,783 --> 00:56:20,512
Get up!

550
00:56:20,685 --> 00:56:22,516
He seems a little sluggish.

551
00:56:23,621 --> 00:56:24,645
Wake him up.

552
00:56:33,531 --> 00:56:35,294
Cold enough?

553
00:56:46,978 --> 00:56:50,778
- Wanna see my swing?
- I'd like to see you in whites.

554
00:56:51,716 --> 00:56:54,913
- Some swing.
- You see me on the golf course?

555
00:56:55,086 --> 00:56:57,145
You got a little cruel streak.

556
00:57:00,024 --> 00:57:01,992
Leone, five-ten.

557
00:57:04,162 --> 00:57:07,893
- Upright. Name and number.
- Leone, five-ten.

558
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:18,402
You'll be praying for some time
on your own. You know that?

559
00:57:18,576 --> 00:57:22,706
- I don't believe that.
- Trust me. I know about these things.

560
00:57:24,015 --> 00:57:26,347
Leone, five-ten.

561
00:57:26,517 --> 00:57:28,508
Water.

562
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,922
Leone, five-ten.

563
00:57:40,732 --> 00:57:42,131
Name and number.

564
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,563
Name and number!
Name and number!

565
00:57:44,736 --> 00:57:47,102
Marilyn Monroe.

566
00:57:47,271 --> 00:57:53,141
Thirty-seven, something, thirty-five.

567
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,052
Crack 121.

568
00:58:09,227 --> 00:58:13,857
Listen, I didn't mean it.
No, I didn't say anything at all. No!

569
00:58:26,611 --> 00:58:29,079
That's enough.

570
00:58:43,995 --> 00:58:46,520
- Who ordered this?
- The warden.

571
00:58:47,031 --> 00:58:51,491
Does the warden hate him enough
to kill him? 'Cause that ain't my job.

572
00:58:51,669 --> 00:58:56,003
Mr. Sensitive. He thinks
we're treating Leone too rough.

573
00:58:56,174 --> 00:58:59,302
Forget which are the cops
and which are the cons?

574
00:58:59,477 --> 00:59:01,468
- You want me? Come on!
- Break it up!

575
00:59:01,646 --> 00:59:04,774
Damn it, I said break it up!
Break it up!

576
00:59:10,221 --> 00:59:13,156
Your stick, Mr. Braden.

577
00:59:18,196 --> 00:59:19,424
Pussy.

578
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:23,431
Get out of my sight, before I shine
my boots with your face...

579
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:27,230
...you fat piece of shit! Go on!

580
00:59:38,549 --> 00:59:40,676
Time's up.

581
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:03,898
Remember what I told you, Frank.

582
01:00:04,075 --> 01:00:09,377
Roll with the system. Roll with it
or it's only gonna get harder.

583
01:00:12,617 --> 01:00:16,781
Yeah, and it's getting shorter too.

584
01:00:33,804 --> 01:00:36,864
So, what's new, Mr. Braden?

585
01:00:38,576 --> 01:00:42,945
How's the family? Good?

586
01:00:43,114 --> 01:00:45,878
How are the Jets doing?

587
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:49,110
Don't forget to check your bed.

588
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,004
Hey, Frank.

589
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:50,374
Somebody die in here?

590
01:01:51,315 --> 01:01:54,773
Ain't a very good welcome home, is it?

591
01:02:05,229 --> 01:02:07,595
Hey, big man.

592
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:12,964
Sand. The whole engine block
is full of it. It was Chink.

593
01:02:13,137 --> 01:02:16,038
What are we gonna do about it?

594
01:02:16,207 --> 01:02:18,471
- Forget it.
- Forget it?

595
01:02:18,643 --> 01:02:22,977
We poured everything we got into this
car. No way we can let Chink slide.

596
01:02:23,147 --> 01:02:26,173
- Let it go, First Base.
- Let it go?!

597
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,376
Aren't you the guy who says
you gotta protect what's yours...

598
01:02:29,553 --> 01:02:33,353
...watch each other's back,
you watch mine, I watch yours?

599
01:02:33,524 --> 01:02:37,858
I guess that was a bunch of jive,
now that you're a short-timer.

600
01:02:38,029 --> 01:02:41,328
You're incredible. What?

601
01:02:41,499 --> 01:02:44,696
You think this is your car?
This ain't your car.

602
01:02:44,869 --> 01:02:49,738
This is the warden's car. Did you
think that Chink Weber did this?

603
01:02:49,907 --> 01:02:53,172
Drumgoole did this.
Come on.

604
01:02:53,344 --> 01:02:57,144
Did you think we were gonna
take our dates out in this car?

605
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,442
Maybe rotate it on weekends.

606
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:03,677
Ernie, why don't you take it Friday.
Dallas, take it Saturday.

607
01:03:03,854 --> 01:03:08,086
And Eclipse, you got it Sunday!
Is that what you thought?

608
01:03:08,259 --> 01:03:12,662
It's his! This lift is his, these
tools are his, the garage is his!

609
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:16,061
This whole goddamn place is his.

610
01:03:16,434 --> 01:03:20,063
And you better remember that,
because once you buy into this...

611
01:03:20,204 --> 01:03:25,665
..."our car," "our thing" concept,
man, you're his too!

612
01:03:33,551 --> 01:03:35,451
Just let it go.

613
01:03:37,421 --> 01:03:41,482
- I thought you were our leader.
- Goddamn it, I'm not your leader!

614
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:43,125
And this ain't a gang.

615
01:03:43,294 --> 01:03:46,786
We're convicts.
We're prisoners, we're inmates.

616
01:03:46,964 --> 01:03:51,060
We're here. And as long as we're
here, we're gonna stay his.

617
01:03:51,235 --> 01:03:53,703
We're his.

618
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:56,431
Nothing's ever gonna change that.

619
01:03:56,607 --> 01:03:59,337
You gotta face the facts.

620
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:03,139
Now, you guys are standup,
no doubt about it.

621
01:04:03,314 --> 01:04:08,411
But I got three weeks to get out of
here. And in three weeks, I'm walking.

622
01:04:08,586 --> 01:04:12,920
Ain't nothing gonna change that.

623
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:15,456
That's all I care about.

624
01:04:25,436 --> 01:04:29,600
It's nothing for nothing, man.
He's right.

625
01:04:41,152 --> 01:04:46,886
Leone, how do you like my belt buckle,
boy? Yeah, I know. I like it too.

626
01:04:47,057 --> 01:04:50,254
A little souvenir
that reminds me of you.

627
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:54,762
Tell me, what are you
going to do about it?

628
01:04:57,568 --> 01:05:03,973
You mean six weeks in the hole
killed your guts and your appetite?

629
01:05:06,677 --> 01:05:10,704
It ain't over, you son of a bitch.

630
01:05:22,593 --> 01:05:27,292
- Anybody call this spot?
- You guys don't need reservations.

631
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:32,164
- You on a diet, Frank? Huh, man?
- Cutting back a little bit.

632
01:05:33,103 --> 01:05:36,504
- Take some of my food.
- Here you go. Don't worry about it.

633
01:05:36,674 --> 01:05:37,834
- Bread.
- Thanks.

634
01:05:38,008 --> 01:05:40,909
Some tomatoes.
You'll be all right. Celery stick.

635
01:05:41,078 --> 01:05:42,511
I ain't playing football.

636
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:47,583
Don't worry about that guy. He's a
lifer. You only got a few weeks to go.

637
01:05:47,751 --> 01:05:49,275
Forget about him.

638
01:05:49,854 --> 01:05:52,914
A miracle just happened.
First Base finally learned something.

639
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:55,058
I doubt it.

640
01:05:55,526 --> 01:05:58,188
- Okay, who's gonna say grace?
- Grace.

641
01:05:58,362 --> 01:06:00,421
She was terrific, wasn't she?

642
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:05,899
- I thought I could rely on you, Weber.
- He won't be pushed.

643
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:09,369
Because you're not pushing
in the right place.

644
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:12,532
Everyone has a weak spot, Weber.

645
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:17,477
Find his, or I'll have
to find a new yard boss.

646
01:06:20,651 --> 01:06:24,348
- Welcome to the Gateway Stakes.
- I feel like a steamed vegetable.

647
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:27,286
- Let's start the race.
- All right. What's your bug's name?

648
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:30,222
- Dirt Creature.
- Three-to-two on Dirt Creature.

649
01:06:30,394 --> 01:06:32,624
- First Base, what's your bug's name?
- Rear Entry.

650
01:06:32,796 --> 01:06:34,491
Rear Entry's 4-to-5.
Place your bets.

651
01:06:34,665 --> 01:06:39,261
Two'll get you three, five'll get
you four. Five'll get you four.

652
01:06:41,939 --> 01:06:44,169
Everything I got on Dirt Creature.

653
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:48,937
- I bet the house on Rear Entry.
- The window is closed. All bets are in.

654
01:06:49,113 --> 01:06:51,479
Gentlemen, start your insects.

655
01:06:51,649 --> 01:06:54,083
- On your marks, get set...
- Come on, Dirt.

656
01:06:54,251 --> 01:06:56,344
Boom! They're off.

657
01:06:58,956 --> 01:07:01,447
I've got a steak dinner
on this victory.

658
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:03,752
Come on, Dirt. Come on.

659
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:07,624
You can't do that.

660
01:07:07,798 --> 01:07:09,322
We got a steward's inquiry.

661
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,161
You can't push your bug!

662
01:07:11,335 --> 01:07:14,031
It was a come-from-behind
victory by Rear Entry!

663
01:07:14,204 --> 01:07:16,502
- We're gonna rerun the race.
- Hey, no rematch.

664
01:07:16,674 --> 01:07:20,542
- Hey! What are you guys doing?
- Shit.

665
01:07:21,278 --> 01:07:24,770
- Pea! You're on the wrong detail.
- Stand up.

666
01:07:24,949 --> 01:07:27,679
Get you ass up here!
Clean up the gym.

667
01:07:27,851 --> 01:07:30,820
- We got a rematch later, all right?
- Sure.

668
01:07:31,188 --> 01:07:33,816
I'm getting out of here.
I'll pay up later.

669
01:07:33,991 --> 01:07:35,288
Now, asshole!

670
01:07:35,859 --> 01:07:39,852
Give me a break. I gotta get
dressed. You know what I mean?

671
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:41,964
Hey, watch out for my bug.

672
01:07:42,132 --> 01:07:45,329
I'll take care of him
for you, really. Delicious.

673
01:07:46,036 --> 01:07:49,631
- Come on, let's do it today!
- All right.

674
01:08:08,359 --> 01:08:10,691
- Clean this place up.
- It's already cleaned.

675
01:08:10,861 --> 01:08:14,353
- What are you, deaf?
- Shut your mouth and do it.

676
01:10:00,504 --> 01:10:02,495
Come on. One by one, come on!

677
01:10:04,975 --> 01:10:06,806
Come on.

678
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,375
Get him down there.

679
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:22,956
Pull his head.

680
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:30,231
I told you we'd play later,
you little bitch.

681
01:10:41,979 --> 01:10:44,209
Hey, Leone!

682
01:10:44,381 --> 01:10:47,475
- They got First.
- I can't hear you.

683
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:54,120
- What did you say?
- They got First Base in the gym.

684
01:10:54,858 --> 01:10:58,692
- What is it?
- They got First Base in the gym.

685
01:11:13,844 --> 01:11:15,937
First!

686
01:11:44,808 --> 01:11:46,935
Twenty years old.

687
01:11:47,244 --> 01:11:53,205
This kid's twenty years old.
I told you.

688
01:11:53,383 --> 01:11:56,875
I know. I know.

689
01:12:05,128 --> 01:12:08,222
You want me, you got me.

690
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,690
You fucking Nazi.

691
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:16,272
You want me, you got me.

692
01:12:48,605 --> 01:12:50,436
Get him. Get him!

693
01:12:50,607 --> 01:12:55,476
- I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
- Come on, fight. Fight!

694
01:13:29,346 --> 01:13:31,541
Kick his ass!

695
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:45,725
I'll kill you.

696
01:13:47,097 --> 01:13:48,655
Son of a bitch.

697
01:13:49,566 --> 01:13:51,158
I'll kill you.

698
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:31,871
Do it.

699
01:14:32,976 --> 01:14:34,307
Crush his face!

700
01:14:38,715 --> 01:14:40,114
- Do it!
- Take him out!

701
01:14:40,283 --> 01:14:41,875
Drop it! Drop it!

702
01:15:03,774 --> 01:15:05,105
God.

703
01:15:24,327 --> 01:15:26,022
Linen run!

704
01:15:26,196 --> 01:15:29,791
Get a move on.
I'm trying to make a living here.

705
01:15:31,535 --> 01:15:35,403
Frank, my man. Florence Nightingale.

706
01:15:36,173 --> 01:15:38,801
- How you feeling?
- All right.

707
01:15:38,975 --> 01:15:43,207
- Three weeks and you're out, man.
- Feels like three years.

708
01:15:43,413 --> 01:15:46,905
Come on, man.
Three weeks is a blink.

709
01:15:48,485 --> 01:15:51,045
What'd they do with the kid?

710
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:57,726
They sent him home, man.
What'd you think? You know.

711
01:15:59,696 --> 01:16:03,496
You know, the kid told me once...

712
01:16:04,468 --> 01:16:10,031
..."Your body has to be in prison, but
your mind can be wherever it wants."

713
01:16:10,674 --> 01:16:12,574
He tell you that?

714
01:16:16,379 --> 01:16:19,314
Listen, I brought you
some toilet paper...

715
01:16:19,483 --> 01:16:23,886
...in case, you know, you want
to write some poetry or something.

716
01:16:25,722 --> 01:16:29,852
Hey, Colonel Klink.
Let me out of here, man.

717
01:16:34,197 --> 01:16:37,030
Frank, man,
it wasn't your fault, okay?

718
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,459
Remember that.

719
01:16:47,611 --> 01:16:52,548
Roberta, have Miss Lowell photographed
for an I.D. For visitation.

720
01:16:52,716 --> 01:16:55,514
I'm reinstating
Mr. Leone's privileges.

721
01:16:55,685 --> 01:16:56,982
Yes, sir.

722
01:16:57,154 --> 01:17:02,182
- I want to make sure Frank's all right.
- He's fine. He's recovering.

723
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:06,989
In three weeks he'll be out, and you can
look forward to a happy life together.

724
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:10,531
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you, warden.

725
01:17:16,206 --> 01:17:18,470
Okay, look into the light.

726
01:17:27,284 --> 01:17:29,275
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

727
01:17:29,452 --> 01:17:33,149
Hi, come here, you.

728
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:36,418
- I was so worried.
- You look great.

729
01:17:36,593 --> 01:17:41,292
Thirty-minute visit, Leone. Compliments
of the warden. Don't waste it.

730
01:17:41,464 --> 01:17:44,831
- How do you feel?
- Good, thanks, sweetheart.

731
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:50,337
Thirty minutes. You need any help,
just give us a call, huh?

732
01:17:54,311 --> 01:17:58,111
- Are they all like that?
- Don't worry. You look great.

733
01:17:58,281 --> 01:17:59,578
You look...

734
01:17:59,749 --> 01:18:03,185
Don't tell me what I look like.
I can't stand it.

735
01:18:03,353 --> 01:18:06,413
I've missed you so much.

736
01:18:14,831 --> 01:18:18,597
No more separations. Promise?

737
01:18:18,802 --> 01:18:21,430
I promise.

738
01:18:38,121 --> 01:18:40,487
- Time's up.
- Nice view.

739
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:43,352
- What's the matter with you?
- Time's up.

740
01:18:43,526 --> 01:18:46,859
- The warden said half an hour.
- He changed his mind.

741
01:18:47,998 --> 01:18:50,899
What do you mean?
I wanna talk to the warden.

742
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:55,868
What you wanna do is keep your mouth
shut, fix your clothes and get out.

743
01:18:56,039 --> 01:18:58,633
- Come on.
- Don't touch her.

744
01:18:59,376 --> 01:19:01,674
What did you say?

745
01:19:01,845 --> 01:19:06,680
- Don't touch her? You don't learn, pal.
- Hey, I'm leaving.

746
01:19:11,054 --> 01:19:14,615
Three weeks.
Three weeks. Three weeks.

747
01:19:41,951 --> 01:19:43,782
Leone.

748
01:19:44,254 --> 01:19:46,279
Come here.

749
01:19:52,028 --> 01:19:53,256
Do I know you?

750
01:19:53,463 --> 01:19:56,955
No, you don't know me, Frank,
but I know you.

751
01:19:57,233 --> 01:19:59,667
I was at Treadmore with you.

752
01:20:01,705 --> 01:20:03,798
A-block.

753
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:08,068
- Treadmore don't have an A-block.
- That's right.

754
01:20:08,244 --> 01:20:12,044
- We got something else in common.
- Yeah, what's that?

755
01:20:12,248 --> 01:20:13,943
We're both getting out soon.

756
01:20:14,217 --> 01:20:18,813
You in a few weeks.
Me, I'm gone the day after tomorrow.

757
01:20:19,556 --> 01:20:21,547
What happened to you?

758
01:20:21,758 --> 01:20:24,556
One beating too many.

759
01:20:24,761 --> 01:20:29,698
I served some hard time in this place.
We both have, am I right?

760
01:20:31,134 --> 01:20:34,399
Yeah, you're right about that.

761
01:20:34,637 --> 01:20:38,835
You need anything when I get out?
Can I get you anything?

762
01:20:39,109 --> 01:20:43,842
- No, I'm all right. Thanks.
- I'm just lucky, I guess.

763
01:20:44,013 --> 01:20:49,974
I got a job lined up. Temporary, but
it pays a grand for two hours of work.

764
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:53,314
- That's not bad, is it?
- What do you gotta do?

765
01:20:56,860 --> 01:21:01,820
I just gotta rape this bitch. I get an
extra hundred every time she screams.

766
01:21:01,998 --> 01:21:05,627
- I'll kill you for that!
- Payback time, Frank.

767
01:21:05,835 --> 01:21:07,860
- Chink says hello.
- You touch her, you're dead!

768
01:21:08,304 --> 01:21:11,000
Hey, bailiff! Guard!
Guard! Somebody!

769
01:21:11,174 --> 01:21:15,474
Manly! Manly! Guard!

770
01:21:16,045 --> 01:21:18,536
- What's your problem?
- I gotta use the phone.

771
01:21:18,715 --> 01:21:23,778
- You know your privileges. No phone.
- That guy is gonna kill my girlfriend.

772
01:21:23,987 --> 01:21:26,387
- What guy?
- The guy that was just here.

773
01:21:26,556 --> 01:21:31,186
- The guy in the wheelchair!
- What are you trying to pull, Leone?

774
01:21:31,361 --> 01:21:34,853
Don't play with me, Manly.
Please, I gotta warn her.

775
01:21:35,031 --> 01:21:39,024
Everybody's got problems, Leone.
Get some sleep.

776
01:21:39,202 --> 01:21:44,196
Goddamn, you fat motherfucker!
Goddamn!

777
01:21:48,812 --> 01:21:53,715
Hey, Frank. Doing some
spring-cleaning, huh, man?

778
01:21:54,317 --> 01:21:56,911
Dallas, come here.

779
01:21:57,153 --> 01:21:58,916
Yeah?

780
01:22:01,925 --> 01:22:05,861
- What is it, man?
- I need some help.

781
01:22:06,029 --> 01:22:08,520
No questions asked.

782
01:22:10,433 --> 01:22:14,199
You're busting out?
You got less than three weeks.

783
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:15,598
Just help me.

784
01:22:15,839 --> 01:22:19,036
- This is gonna take days.
- I need it tonight.

785
01:22:19,242 --> 01:22:22,734
I can't do that.
Everything is gonna be locked up.

786
01:22:22,912 --> 01:22:26,313
There's a con getting
out of here tomorrow.

787
01:22:26,549 --> 01:22:30,041
- Chink Weber paid him to get Melissa.
- I understand.

788
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:35,622
I'd love to help, but I can't do
the impossible. You're hurting my arm.

789
01:22:41,464 --> 01:22:44,194
I'll take you with me.

790
01:22:46,269 --> 01:22:48,760
No shit?

791
01:22:49,272 --> 01:22:51,934
- What's the plan?
- You'll know when you gotta know.

792
01:22:53,843 --> 01:22:57,210
Going for the tunnels, huh, man?

793
01:22:57,413 --> 01:22:59,745
You just be here, all right?

794
01:23:00,917 --> 01:23:03,283
Convict, move it out of there!

795
01:23:03,453 --> 01:23:08,288
Hey, use some bleach on that, Frank.
I'm coming out, Colonel Klink.

796
01:23:12,428 --> 01:23:13,656
Linen run.

797
01:23:13,830 --> 01:23:17,163
- Evening, Officer Vazquez.
- You're late. Get in there.

798
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,628
- Yes, sir.
- Quick.

799
01:23:18,902 --> 01:23:21,962
- I'll be real quick.
- Still making that jailhouse booze?

800
01:23:22,238 --> 01:23:26,572
Absolutely not, sir. I'm on the wagon.
I joined Alcoholics Unanimous.

801
01:23:26,809 --> 01:23:29,676
- You got some line of shit.
- It's bad on my nervous system.

802
01:23:29,913 --> 01:23:32,575
- Makes me talk too much.
- Just make it quick.

803
01:23:32,782 --> 01:23:36,115
Yeah, I'll be right out, sir.
Right out.

804
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:46,128
No. Help! Oh, shit!

805
01:23:48,498 --> 01:23:50,489
Help me!

806
01:23:52,602 --> 01:23:54,297
Come on, Frank. Let's go.

807
01:23:54,537 --> 01:23:56,767
Okay, come on. That's it.

808
01:24:00,143 --> 01:24:03,476
- All right, we got 10 minutes. Move it.
- All right.

809
01:24:03,713 --> 01:24:05,613
Sweet dreams, Moby Dick.

810
01:24:06,349 --> 01:24:07,839
- Frank?
- Come on.

811
01:24:08,117 --> 01:24:09,914
The tools, man.

812
01:24:23,967 --> 01:24:25,332
You got it.

813
01:24:27,503 --> 01:24:29,937
Okay, here I go.

814
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,035
Oh, God. I'm jumping.

815
01:24:35,979 --> 01:24:38,504
Man, there's rats in here.

816
01:24:49,826 --> 01:24:52,317
- All right. I'm all right. No!
- What?

817
01:24:52,495 --> 01:24:55,760
- This way. It's a shortcut to the plant.
- It's this way.

818
01:24:55,965 --> 01:25:01,198
No, man, I remember the map.
It's this way. I'm positive. Let's go!

819
01:25:19,222 --> 01:25:20,917
D.T.A., Frank.

820
01:25:22,925 --> 01:25:26,258
Ain't that what you taught me, man?
D.T.A.

821
01:25:26,429 --> 01:25:28,920
Right on schedule, Frank.

822
01:25:29,132 --> 01:25:31,726
I'm sorry, man.
You were my ticket out of here.

823
01:25:32,301 --> 01:25:34,292
Damn you!

824
01:25:38,141 --> 01:25:42,544
You had me set up the whole time?!

825
01:25:42,745 --> 01:25:47,808
Not the whole time. I got
30 years to go, man. Thirty years.

826
01:25:48,785 --> 01:25:51,447
The warden made me a deal.

827
01:25:52,789 --> 01:25:54,814
Dumb bastard!

828
01:25:55,058 --> 01:25:57,083
They made me a deal, man!
A deal!

829
01:25:57,293 --> 01:26:00,592
We don't make deals
with escaping prisoners.

830
01:26:03,566 --> 01:26:06,091
What the hell are you talking about?

831
01:26:06,335 --> 01:26:08,803
- You said if I delivered...
- Shut up.

832
01:26:09,072 --> 01:26:12,564
- You're going back to the population.
- Population?

833
01:26:12,775 --> 01:26:16,108
You can't do this to me, warden.
You can't do this.

834
01:26:16,345 --> 01:26:19,439
I snitched him off.
They're gonna kill me. I'm finished.

835
01:26:19,615 --> 01:26:21,480
Tough.

836
01:26:21,851 --> 01:26:25,651
Look, I came through, goddamn it!
We had a deal!

837
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:30,652
That's enough.
You're gonna kill him.

838
01:26:32,195 --> 01:26:33,389
That's enough.

839
01:26:39,936 --> 01:26:42,769
This is an automatic 10 years, Frank.

840
01:26:42,972 --> 01:26:46,430
It's 10 years for a second
escape attempt.

841
01:26:46,609 --> 01:26:50,272
I knew you'd cross the line. I told
them you were a hard-core criminal.

842
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:54,678
They'll believe me now.
And you better believe me.

843
01:26:54,884 --> 01:26:58,445
You better believe that you'll
be doing hard time here...

844
01:26:58,688 --> 01:27:01,122
...for the rest of your life.

845
01:27:02,458 --> 01:27:04,653
Manly, you know what to do.

846
01:27:17,874 --> 01:27:19,865
Some dealmaker.

847
01:27:28,851 --> 01:27:30,113
See...

848
01:27:30,386 --> 01:27:32,854
...shit does float, doesn't it?

849
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:34,953
Hey, you know what else?

850
01:27:35,124 --> 01:27:39,322
You don't have to worry about
that psycho hurting your girlfriend.

851
01:27:39,562 --> 01:27:42,998
We decided to keep him in here.
Didn't we, officer?

852
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,808
She's not my type.

853
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:56,746
We'll teach him a lesson.
We'll graduate you with honours.

854
01:27:56,746 --> 01:27:59,544
We'll teach him a lesson.
We'll graduate you with honours.

855
01:27:59,782 --> 01:28:04,151
Turn on the steam.
Turn on the fucking steam!

856
01:28:04,353 --> 01:28:05,945
Put him in it.

857
01:28:06,255 --> 01:28:08,052
Get him in there.

858
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:16,794
Bring him in here! Come on!

859
01:28:22,572 --> 01:28:24,540
Come on!

860
01:28:33,182 --> 01:28:35,173
Rape this.

861
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:42,589
My face! My face is burning!
My face!

862
01:28:58,207 --> 01:28:59,970
I'll kill you!

863
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:27,726
School's out, punk.

864
01:30:26,395 --> 01:30:27,987
Frank.

865
01:30:30,032 --> 01:30:32,660
Frank, don't leave me here, man.

866
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:42,807
I'm sorry.

867
01:30:43,512 --> 01:30:45,503
Take me with you.

868
01:31:06,035 --> 01:31:08,265
Let him go, Manly.

869
01:31:08,537 --> 01:31:10,334
Let him go.

870
01:31:18,647 --> 01:31:20,774
What are you gonna do with that?

871
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:22,711
You okay, Frank?

872
01:31:23,285 --> 01:31:25,116
I'm okay, Dallas.

873
01:31:25,988 --> 01:31:29,116
You can trust me, Frank.
You can trust me.

874
01:31:29,392 --> 01:31:32,452
- Put it down, Dallas.
- Put it down.

875
01:31:32,728 --> 01:31:36,391
- I won't hurt you anymore.
- Oh, yeah?

876
01:31:38,501 --> 01:31:42,369
- You don't wanna do it.
- You fat piece of shit.

877
01:31:42,538 --> 01:31:43,903
Don't do it, Dallas.

878
01:31:44,507 --> 01:31:48,068
- What, are you trying to scare me?
- Dallas, don't.

879
01:31:49,779 --> 01:31:52,646
- You won't do it.
- Oh, yeah?

880
01:31:52,948 --> 01:31:57,009
- You don't got the balls to do it, punk.
- You're wrong.

881
01:31:57,186 --> 01:31:59,654
- Stoolie.
- You're wrong.

882
01:32:00,589 --> 01:32:02,648
- Put it down.
- You're wrong!

883
01:32:02,925 --> 01:32:04,324
No!

884
01:32:22,678 --> 01:32:26,546
Switch to backup. Sir, we've got
a power outage in C-wing.

885
01:32:27,283 --> 01:32:29,717
Get some men to that utility quarter.

886
01:32:53,442 --> 01:32:57,572
You better have a good reason for not
telling me you knew Leone was escaping.

887
01:32:57,746 --> 01:33:00,476
I've got a dead officer and
a dead inmate.

888
01:33:00,716 --> 01:33:02,911
And I don't have any answers.
Do you?

889
01:33:03,085 --> 01:33:06,612
I was trying to save an informant's
life by keeping it secret.

890
01:33:06,789 --> 01:33:11,249
Why would a man who's got
three weeks to go try to break out?

891
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,154
We can ask him
when we catch him.

892
01:33:34,216 --> 01:33:38,277
Busted cable, utility corridor.
He's going to the roof.

893
01:35:09,578 --> 01:35:11,603
Bring up zone two.

894
01:35:12,448 --> 01:35:14,348
Can't you get any more light in there?

895
01:35:14,516 --> 01:35:15,915
Captain Meissner.

896
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:18,280
This is Osner.
I'm in the well room.

897
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:20,581
Looks like this is where he went out.

898
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:34,528
Sir, that has got to be at least
200 yards underwater.

899
01:35:34,737 --> 01:35:37,865
- Do you really think he made it?
- Maybe not, Mr. Braden.

900
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:40,665
But until you bring me a body,
I've got an escaped prisoner.

901
01:35:40,843 --> 01:35:43,835
- This is Drumgoole. I want sector four.
- Meissner, sector four.

902
01:35:44,013 --> 01:35:47,244
- What do you have?
- Right now, nothing, sir.

903
01:35:47,483 --> 01:35:50,850
I'm thinking of calling in the
local and state police.

904
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:55,819
No! No outside agencies.
I repeat, no outside agencies.

905
01:35:56,025 --> 01:35:59,620
This is an internal matter.
He's alive, I want him.

906
01:35:59,862 --> 01:36:03,958
- Arm a tactical squad and meet me.
- Yes, sir.

907
01:36:04,867 --> 01:36:08,928
Mr. Braden, you will

908
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,960
You won't get away with it.

909
01:36:35,464 --> 01:36:37,295
You know that, don't you?

910
01:36:38,667 --> 01:36:40,862
I could've got out.

911
01:36:42,805 --> 01:36:46,104
But I'm not going to spend my life...

912
01:36:46,375 --> 01:36:49,970
...running from you.

913
01:36:54,316 --> 01:36:56,284
Paul, look at this.

914
01:36:59,488 --> 01:37:01,115
Get your ass inside.

915
01:37:01,390 --> 01:37:03,381
Whoa, hold it.

916
01:37:04,093 --> 01:37:07,187
- You can't use me as a hostage...
- Shut up! Shut up!

917
01:37:07,429 --> 01:37:10,296
You recognize that chair?

918
01:37:10,566 --> 01:37:14,832
You built it, didn't you?
Now get in there. Get in there!

919
01:37:15,070 --> 01:37:17,334
Don't even think about moving.

920
01:37:20,342 --> 01:37:24,642
You think you're gonna take me
to hell, huh? I'll show you hell!

921
01:37:26,315 --> 01:37:28,806
All right, over there.

922
01:37:29,318 --> 01:37:31,115
Move your leg!

923
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:35,720
Dallas, he fried,
the way you're gonna fry.

924
01:37:37,159 --> 01:37:42,358
First Base, you took him downstairs,
you broke his goddamn neck!

925
01:37:44,933 --> 01:37:49,927
I'm gonna fry your brains.
What do you know? It's a perfect fit.

926
01:37:50,806 --> 01:37:52,797
Move! Move!

927
01:37:54,276 --> 01:37:58,713
You can't make this work.
You're not smart enough. You're stupid.

928
01:37:58,881 --> 01:38:00,314
You're scum.

929
01:38:00,482 --> 01:38:03,451
Shut up! I'll show you scum.

930
01:38:04,686 --> 01:38:08,452
You can't kill a man. You're not
a murderer. You don't have the guts.

931
01:38:14,363 --> 01:38:17,196
Ten more years.
Isn't that what you said?

932
01:38:18,133 --> 01:38:19,896
How about 20?

933
01:38:20,369 --> 01:38:21,802
How about 30?

934
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:26,564
No, it doesn't matter what they give
me because you won't be satisfied...

935
01:38:26,842 --> 01:38:28,207
...till you got me for life.

936
01:38:28,377 --> 01:38:30,368
Make a hole.

937
01:38:30,646 --> 01:38:32,204
Take it down!

938
01:38:34,583 --> 01:38:36,778
I ain't doing life for nothing.

939
01:38:38,053 --> 01:38:40,283
Come on. Lean on it, man!

940
01:38:40,489 --> 01:38:43,322
They're gonna break that door down.

941
01:38:43,559 --> 01:38:46,426
And they're going to take
your skull apart!

942
01:38:46,595 --> 01:38:49,655
You're going to beg me
to let them kill you.

943
01:38:50,032 --> 01:38:52,432
- Come on, break it down!
- Meissner!

944
01:38:53,936 --> 01:38:55,995
Harder, man. Harder!

945
01:39:00,042 --> 01:39:02,237
Come on, lean on it.

946
01:39:02,744 --> 01:39:04,336
No!

947
01:39:06,181 --> 01:39:07,739
No!

948
01:39:09,852 --> 01:39:11,410
Take out the glass!

949
01:39:14,623 --> 01:39:16,682
Shoot! Shoot me!

950
01:39:16,859 --> 01:39:18,326
- Don't shoot!
- Shoot!

951
01:39:18,527 --> 01:39:20,961
He has his hand taped to the lever.

952
01:39:21,430 --> 01:39:22,897
No!

953
01:39:23,398 --> 01:39:27,425
- Don't shoot!
- Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

954
01:39:27,603 --> 01:39:28,934
Come on, shoot!

955
01:39:31,373 --> 01:39:32,931
Hold your fire!

956
01:39:35,911 --> 01:39:38,539
Relax. Just relax.

957
01:39:39,381 --> 01:39:42,782
Glad you're here, Meissner. This
wouldn't be official without witnesses.

958
01:39:42,951 --> 01:39:47,945
He's bluffing. He's wants me to take
responsibility for his escape attempt.

959
01:39:48,223 --> 01:39:51,954
I don't want a confession.
You set me up. You set everything up!

960
01:39:52,127 --> 01:39:56,461
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm talking about Chink Weber!

961
01:39:56,665 --> 01:39:58,360
The goons.

962
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,667
The cop that was gonna rape Melissa.

963
01:40:02,471 --> 01:40:03,768
Dallas.

964
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:07,106
The killing of the kid.

965
01:40:08,243 --> 01:40:10,234
Guilty on all counts.

966
01:40:10,412 --> 01:40:15,577
Prove it! That's your problem.
You can't prove anything.

967
01:40:15,751 --> 01:40:20,313
I don't have to prove nothing.
I came here for an execution.

968
01:40:20,489 --> 01:40:23,788
I demand to be released from here!

969
01:40:24,826 --> 01:40:26,259
No!

970
01:40:26,428 --> 01:40:30,888
Don't do it, Leone. Don't do it.
Take it easy.

971
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:34,899
You deserve payback.

972
01:40:35,103 --> 01:40:36,502
Frank!

973
01:40:38,674 --> 01:40:40,665
Please, Frank.

974
01:40:41,944 --> 01:40:45,675
Don't kill me. It's true.

975
01:40:48,684 --> 01:40:52,176
I confess, Mr. Meissner.

976
01:40:52,454 --> 01:40:55,321
Everything that he said was true.

977
01:40:55,557 --> 01:40:58,424
I set him up. Everything.

978
01:41:02,164 --> 01:41:03,631
Please.

979
01:41:04,967 --> 01:41:07,162
Don't kill me.

980
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:09,864
Don't...

981
01:41:10,572 --> 01:41:16,010
See you in hell, Drumgoole.

982
01:41:32,894 --> 01:41:35,328
Works better with this.

983
01:41:37,265 --> 01:41:39,631
Take him to the hole, Mr. Meissner.

984
01:41:40,002 --> 01:41:44,098
Mr. Braden, take the prisoner
to the hole.

985
01:41:44,373 --> 01:41:46,204
- Cuff him.
- Yes, sir.

986
01:41:46,475 --> 01:41:50,741
Somebody get me
out of this chair.

987
01:41:52,247 --> 01:41:53,680
Come on.

988
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:02,716
Thank you, Mr. Meissner.
I said take him to the hole.

989
01:42:02,891 --> 01:42:04,722
I can't do that.

990
01:42:05,427 --> 01:42:07,224
Take the warden into custody.

991
01:42:07,429 --> 01:42:10,523
- I said take him. What are you doing?
- Cuff him.

992
01:42:10,799 --> 01:42:16,203
Stop it! I am warden of this institution,
and you will obey... Stop that!

993
01:42:16,638 --> 01:42:21,905
That was just a stupid confession to
try and save my life. Are you crazy?

994
01:42:22,310 --> 01:42:24,540
No, but you are.

995
01:42:24,813 --> 01:42:29,944
Until this matter's resolved in a judicial
inquiry, you'll remain in our custody.

996
01:42:32,287 --> 01:42:34,949
I'll have your ass for this.

997
01:42:35,223 --> 01:42:38,715
I'll have your ass.

998
01:42:39,761 --> 01:42:41,422
Move him!

999
01:42:52,841 --> 01:42:55,469
I only wanted to do my time, captain.

1000
01:42:55,911 --> 01:42:58,402
You'll get your chance.

1001
01:42:58,580 --> 01:43:00,673
Move him.

1002
01:43:20,502 --> 01:43:22,595
Hey, Ernie.

1003
01:43:22,771 --> 01:43:24,636
Hang in there, Frank.

1004
01:43:25,006 --> 01:43:26,496
Hey, Frank?

1005
01:43:26,675 --> 01:43:28,666
- Eclipse.
- Take care.

1006
01:43:28,844 --> 01:43:31,472
You too. Thanks a lot, big man.

1007
01:43:31,646 --> 01:43:34,843
Yeah. That okay?

1008
01:43:35,016 --> 01:43:36,779
It's all right.

1009
01:43:39,154 --> 01:43:43,955
Got this one from
Fidel Castro himself.

1010
01:43:46,161 --> 01:43:48,823
- See you, big man.
- Okay.

1011
01:44:08,850 --> 01:44:10,750
Hold it.

1012
01:44:11,052 --> 01:44:13,885
Crack the outside!

1013
01:44:14,756 --> 01:44:18,624
- Know what I'll miss most about you?
- What's that?

1014
01:44:19,494 --> 01:44:22,258
Your incredible smile.

1015
01:44:33,642 --> 01:44:37,510
- Take care of yourself, Leone.
- Thanks, captain.

1016
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:50,050
Lock 'em!
