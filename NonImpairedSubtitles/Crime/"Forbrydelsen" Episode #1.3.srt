1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,804
- I can't take this case.
- You found her.

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,488
We've been through this.
Our things are in Sweden.

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,730
Mark and Bengt are waiting
and Mark starts school on Monday.

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,003
She was alive
when she went in the water.

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,522
It takes 20 minutes
for a car to fill with water.

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,406
She was raped several times,
vaginally and anally.

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,248
- How much do you know?
- It's too early to say.

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,924
- You'll find him'?
- We'll do our utmost.

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,920
- You'll find him.
- Now we'll have to...

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,127
think of the boys, we...

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,163
must be strong now.

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,522
We must tell them.

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,686
Look what I made, Mum.

14
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,327
She was found
in one of your cars.

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,966
I'd like to know
who drove it last.

16
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,528
We want to go public
so We're not hiding anything.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,884
- You can't publish now.
- We're running a campaign.

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,401
- We can't wait
- You'll have to

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,685
The driver is John Lynge.
And We're going to get him.

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,889
In '96 he was caught
flashing in a playground.

21
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,084
He raped a 14-year-old girl.

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,601
- We're very close.
- How close?

23
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,564
- Today?
- I hope so.

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,769
You're welcome.

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,807
What?

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,962
A journo from an agency.
They know about the car.

27
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,050
They'll think
We're covering up a murder.

28
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,403
The alliance with the Centre Party
will be ruined.

29
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,002
He had three visitors
while he was incarcerated.

30
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,682
One is dead, one has moved
and one isn't answering.

31
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,564
Sarah Lund, CID.

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,003
- Do you have visitors?
- No, it's just my cat.

33
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,042
Lund here. I need backup.

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,641
The suspect may be
at this address.

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,081
We go in now. Get your gun.

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,884
I don't use one.

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,324
- We're staying here.
- Like hell we are.

38
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,965
Meyer!

39
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,520
THE KILLING

40
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,528
- What are you doing'?
- Not taking a pee.

41
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,769
- I told you to wait
- Relax, damn it.

42
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,721
Now.

43
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,727
You go left, I'll go right.

44
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,846
- Bloody hell.
- You weigh 7.682 kilos.

45
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,170
Mrs Heglberg'?

46
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,367
Mrs Heglberg, where is he'?

47
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,570
What's she saying?

48
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,851
Stay here and don't move.

49
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,128
- Don't go.
- I'll be back soon.

50
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,041
- Don't go.
- Lean back like this.

51
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,720
I want my cane.

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,561
- Where's your cane.
- In the hallway.

53
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,809
Fine. I'll find it for you.
Stay here.

54
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,086
Get back! I'm a police officer.

55
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,760
Move back. All the way.

56
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,881
Take it easy.
I won't hurt you.

57
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,684
I'm alone.

58
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,963
- I didn't do anything.
- I'm not saying you did.

59
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,562
- You don't believe me.
- First put the knife down.

60
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,850
Right'?

61
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,731
- No more prison...
- I just want to talk.

62
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,605
Okay? Now, We're talking.

63
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,684
I fell ill at the school.
I took a cab to Nordvang.

64
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,042
When I got back
the car was gone.

65
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,962
I lost the keys when I threw up.
Someone took them.

66
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,130
- What keys'?
- The car keys. I was ill!

67
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,129
Fine. Okay.

68
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,244
You fell ill.
I'm hearing you.

69
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,887
You fell ill.
Put the knife down and we'll talk.

70
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,610
- You won't.
- John!

71
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,331
- Drop the knife.
- Put your gun away!

72
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,328
He fell five meters.
Fractured skull, left side.

73
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,962
When can I talk to him'?

74
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,321
We must stop
his internal bleeding.

75
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,569
But he'll survive'?
Will he survive'?

76
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,368
Prints, hair and blood
have gone to forensics.

77
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,201
- They'll check his boots.
- He went to the psych center.

78
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,927
He lost the car keys
at the school when he got sick.

79
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,487
The car was gone
when he got back.

80
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,967
- He would say that.
- We didn't find out.

81
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,562
- He Would've out you again.
- Just check it out.

82
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,370
- Check if he has an alibi.
- Fine. I'll do it.

83
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,802
- Shouldn't you get that seen to'?
- Yes, I'd better.

84
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,564
- What about the old woman?
- She's with her family.

85
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,326
Good.

86
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,451
Get some sleep.

87
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,961
Report to me
when you know how he is.

88
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,323
It's arrogant to think
the voters wouldn't know.

89
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,570
We need housing in the city
that people can afford.

90
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,081
We have a plan.

91
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,011
It's pork barreling.
We both know that.

92
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,443
- The voters can count on...
- Let's see it first.

93
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,688
- Let's...
- That's all...

94
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,724
Thanks for coming.
Thank you, both of you.

95
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,843
Good luck with the election.

96
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,921
We continue with other news.
To the EU summit in Brussels.

97
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,727
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

98
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,242
- Thanks for tonight.
- Yes, of course.

99
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,647
Only one journalist knows.

100
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,242
That's right.
What about the police?

101
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,250
I haven't heard from them
so I don't know.

102
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,010
We'll go ahead.

103
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,965
Tell the journalist
he'll get a scoop.

104
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,288
A crisis meeting, eh?

105
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,610
Lozenge'?

106
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,084
Why not?

107
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,289
If you don't mind me saying,
you were a bit rusty tonight.

108
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,968
- You think so?
- Yes.

109
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,963
Luckily the election
is a long way off.

110
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,128
Saving your ammunition?

111
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,403
That's sensible.
I've heard you'll need it.

112
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,482
We've got a problem.

113
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,724
- What?
- It's on the Internet.

114
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,005
Answer their questions
with consideration and authority.

115
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,521
Don't let them upset you.

116
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,168
I can't get hold of Lund.

117
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,448
What's your connection
to Nanna Birk Larsen?

118
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,085
A young girl has been found murdered
in a car leased by my campaign office.

119
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,884
That's all.

120
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,449
We're assisting the police.
They asked us not to comment.

121
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,166
- When did you know?
- I'd like to say...

122
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,001
that no one in our party
or organization is involved.

123
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,603
Do you deny withholding
information due to the campaign?

124
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,204
- I deny that categorically.
- Troels...

125
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,927
- It has nothing to do with politics.
- Troels...

126
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,009
We're assisting the police.

127
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,489
We're doing all we can
to solve this meaningless tragedy.

128
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,728
A young girl is dead.

129
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,571
I'd like to express my sympathy
to her family and friends.

130
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,207
What effect will the murder
have on your campaign?

131
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,889
Call the press
after I've talked to the police.

132
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,082
Half the council has called.

133
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,727
The Centre Party rang.
Call Eller back personally.

134
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,161
Give me only the important calls.

135
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,885
And no journalists.

136
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,846
- Call the parliament first.
- No, they can damn well wait

137
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,010
- Did we send flowers?
- Yes, that's done.

138
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,281
Coffee's on its way.

139
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,769
You went too far.
Don't let them get to you.

140
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,485
I know.

141
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,768
- That's howl am.
- I spoke with the journalist.

142
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,811
He was briefed anonymously.

143
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,201
- He may be protecting his source.
- He heard it from the police or from us.

144
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,648
- Why would he hear it from us'?
- Who else would know?

145
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,084
- Your calendar and the schools...
- It could be the police.

146
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,361
If I can access the server's log
I can check all outgoing mail.

147
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,085
- Personal mail?
- Not to read it.

148
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,409
- We can't.
- Just to check the traffic.

149
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,045
We can't.

150
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,208
We're all under suspicion...

151
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,890
No.

152
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,203
Find another way.

153
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,767
Okay?

154
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,690
Troels here.

155
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,080
Murdered girl
found in Hartmann's car.

156
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,681
Driver Wanted.

157
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,166
The car belongs to that politician.
They're looking for a driver.

158
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,208
- They say nothing.
- We'll know when they know.

159
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,721
They know more than they say.

160
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,571
- Don't you want to know?
- Stop it now.

161
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,371
It won't bring Nanna back, will it'?

162
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,842
- How did she know the driver?
- I don't know!

163
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,331
Darling...

164
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,364
Let's get away for a few days.

165
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,960
We could rent the summer house
we had before.

166
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,322
The police come around constantly.

167
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,683
The kids see Nanna
in the papers all the time.

168
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,168
Or on TV.

169
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,842
What about the funeral?

170
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,366
We'll talk to the pastor
and make the arrangements.

171
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,680
Okay?

172
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,802
Do you know what time it is'?

173
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,286
Hi.

174
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,767
Try not to throw your clothes
everywhere like that.

175
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,567
No wonder Mark's a messy boy.

176
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,728
You could use a plate.

177
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,442
What happened?

178
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,961
- Nothing.
- You're bleeding.

179
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,924
A cat scratched me.

180
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,201
No cat could have done that.

181
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,125
A wild one

182
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,883
Why do you have to continue
with that job?

183
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,520
You have a chance
for a decent life.

184
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,327
I'm only here till Friday.
We could move to a hotel.

185
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,170
Of course not.

186
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,847
Sorry, Mum. I'm very tired.

187
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,608
This is nice.

188
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,201
Bengt wants you to come
to our housewarming on Saturday.

189
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,090
He told me. He wants me
to design the guest room, too.

190
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,807
He called this afternoon,
Wondering where you Were.

191
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,843
Damn it.

192
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,131
Did you tell him
I was Working till Friday?

193
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,323
- You said you'd left...
- It's only till Friday.

194
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,966
Sorry I didn't call.
Come down here.

195
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,242
- And live with your mum'?
- Yes.

196
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,329
That would be cost.

197
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,650
The workmen and removalists
are here, so it's not possible.

198
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,610
How's the sauna?
Polar pine is really good for saunas.

199
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,489
Yes, that should be fine.

200
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,411
- I have to go now.
- I miss you.

201
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,807
Well, I miss you too.

202
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,122
- Say it as if you mean it.
- You know I mean it.

203
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,802
But I've got wood glue on me
that I can't get off.

204
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,880
Okay.

205
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,646
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- Okay.

206
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,411
- Good night.
- You too.

207
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,171
<i>- I'd like to say...
- When did you know?</i>

208
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,966
<i>No one in our party is involved.</i>

209
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,801
<i>You deny withholding
information due to the campaign?</i>

210
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,925
- I love you.
- Oh'? I'm happy to hear it.

211
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,367
Yes'?

212
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,928
It's true. Lynge was admitted
to Nordvang on Friday.

213
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,249
- For how long'?
- He had problems with his medicine.

214
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,006
He was in hospital all day.

215
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,808
- Could he have slipped out?
- Not unless he can fly.

216
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,641
- Lay off the chips, eh?
- Sorry, but I haven't eaten.

217
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,207
- Have you found her bicycle?
- No.

218
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,325
- Her mobile?
- The techs are Working on it.

219
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,363
The last call was on Friday.
It seems to have come from the school.

220
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,642
We'll go there in the morning.

221
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,969
- Don't count on going.
- Why not?

222
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,484
Buchard said
Hartman wants a meeting.

223
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,243
Get some sleep
and don't forget your report.

224
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,885
Sleep well, Mum

225
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,648
<i>We 're assisting the police.</i>

226
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,724
<i>We're doing all we can
to solve this meaningless tragedy.</i>

227
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,847
<i>A young girl is dead.</i>

228
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,726
<i>I 'd like to express my sympathy
to her family and friends.</i>

229
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,410
<i>What effect will.</i> ..

230
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,206
This is exactly
what we didn't want.

231
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,564
- We held back because of you.
- I guarantee we didn't leak it.

232
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,924
No one knew the registration
Only the core group did.

233
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,364
- Has the driver confessed?
- No, because he didn't do it.

234
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,847
- Didn't you say'?
- I know.

235
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,884
We thought he was the one
but he isn't.

236
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,721
Someone else used his car.
It's possible it was stolen.

237
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,088
- When will you go public'?
- We want to wait.

238
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,964
For What?

239
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,402
The driver's hurt but we hope
to question him today.

240
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,207
If our car was stolen
we want the press to know soon.

241
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,086
We may want the culprit
to think we have a suspect.

242
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,204
So you are pleased
someone leaked it'?

243
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,803
- We didn't know he was innocent.
- We want it out now.

244
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,322
- If you won't do it, we will
- We want you to wait.

245
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,409
It's not negotiable. Bye.

246
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,683
- I'll keep you informed.
- That would be nice.

247
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,281
Hartman!

248
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,081
It's unfortunate, but listen.

249
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,328
I've been hung out as a suspect.

250
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,127
- You promised to co-operate.
- We've Waited and waited.

251
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,369
- I'm begging you.
- We have to leave.

252
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,961
Lund! You've got guests.

253
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,323
Just a moment.

254
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,881
We're late. We have to leave.

255
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,246
Were they...

256
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,010
- Waiting Will make a difference?
- Yes. It Will.

257
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,008
You've got till tomorrow.

258
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,327
We've got an interim report
but forensics wants to keep Nanna.

259
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,807
We'll be leaving today...

260
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,001
for the summer house.

261
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,171
We just want to be sure
that the funeral's arranged.

262
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,527
Sure.

263
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,849
What are they doing to her?

264
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,566
Some further examinations.

265
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,209
You'll be contacted
as soon as you can collect her.

266
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,249
Where will they send her?

267
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,206
Normally to an undertaker.

268
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,290
- Do you have one'?
- We're seeing a priest.

269
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,124
- What exactly happened to her?
- I can't tell you yet.

270
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,963
But I understand
why you want to know.

271
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,847
No.

272
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,449
- Here's my mobile number.
- Excuse me.

273
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,367
Call if there is anything.

274
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,489
Close that door!

275
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,608
I deeply regret this.

276
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,449
I'm so sorry.

277
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,851
I think we'd better leave

278
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,442
Call me if I can do anything.
No matter what the time.

279
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,571
We still need some answers.

280
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,367
I'm addressing the students
at a memorial service.

281
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,088
She was last seen at the party.
I need to know about that party.

282
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,921
- Right now I need to...
- Your needs are irrelevant.

283
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,282
I want answers. Now.

284
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,768
You don't seriously think
any of us are involved?

285
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,601
The sooner I can do my Work
the sooner I can tell you.

286
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,408
Lynge got here at noon
and went to the office.

287
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,406
- Why?
- No idea.

288
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,171
Laziness? Or he felt ill.

289
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,365
- He could've lost the keys there.
- Or anywhere.

290
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,530
- Who had gym afterwards'?
- No one till Monday.

291
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,929
No one has seen lost keys
or anything like that.

292
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,361
What have we got on the girl'?

293
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,930
Top marks. Well-liked.
Not a negative word about her.

294
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,520
Lots of boys tried to score her.

295
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,564
- Did she let them?
- No, except for one.

296
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,445
The ex-boyfriend,
Oliver Schandorff.

297
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,041
- Any drugs?
- Nothing.

298
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,004
Drank occasionally.

299
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,282
Look at this picture.

300
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,247
She was seen dancing that night
but no one saw her after 9.30.

301
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,010
Why leave early
after having worked so hard?

302
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,171
You're right, but maybe
there's a good reason here.

303
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,407
Why didn't you tell me
she'd argued with her ex,

304
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,807
Oliver, on the dance floor'?

305
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,966
- It Wasn't important.
- Others noticed it.

306
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,325
Well, we were dancing and he
started arguing. It was nothing.

307
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,648
He threw a chair.

308
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,569
- Was Nanna drunk?
- No.

309
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,651
- But you Were?
- A bit, perhaps.

310
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,526
- What's Wrong with that?
- Why did they break up?

311
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,211
She thought he was
an overgrown boy.

312
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,730
Why did you say
she was with him on the Weekend?

313
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,651
I hoped she was
when I couldn't find her.

314
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,888
What did they fight about?

315
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,325
- He wanted to talk, she didn't.
- And she left shortly after'?

316
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,929
- Did you see Oliver then?
- It was his turn in the bar.

317
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,567
- You're sure'?
- I saw him there.

318
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,846
According to the bar roster
he Wasn't there at that time.

319
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,722
No one else saw him there.

320
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,727
Let me get this straight.
She hugged you and said bye'?

321
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,887
Yes.

322
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,162
She walked this way, downstairs,
and out the door'? Right?

323
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,966
- Yes.
- What was she wearing?

324
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,960
A witch's hat with a buckle.

325
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,606
And a purple wig.

326
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,044
And a rather tattered dress
with short sleeves.

327
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,687
Wasn't it odd
she was dressed so lightly?

328
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,042
I presume she had a coat.

329
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,004
You said she had bare arms.

330
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,565
I don't remember.

331
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,088
And her change of clothes?

332
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,326
I think we left them
in the classroom.

333
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,211
Why go downstairs and not up?

334
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,370
- Down and out the door'?
- She must have gone up.

335
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,050
People everywhere...

336
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,131
You don't know when or where
or if Oliver followed her.

337
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,607
We know you're lying.

338
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,005
Did he find the keys
and get into the car to show off?

339
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,850
- What?
- Listen.

340
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,487
It's important that you tell us
all you know. Right?

341
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,445
- I know nothing.
- You have to help us.

342
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,688
- Listen to me.
- I don't...

343
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,211
Come.

344
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,370
- Now.
- Are you okay?

345
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,529
- Where was it'?
- We found it in the garbage bin.

346
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,082
- What about her bicycle?
- We haven't found it yet.

347
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,369
Got a pen'?

348
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,050
Thanks.

349
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,569
Cordon off the area
and call forensics.

350
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,849
Better call them now.

351
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,446
Give me a call
as soon as you know.

352
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,244
Yes, bye.

353
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,686
- Did you see the latest poll'?
- I did.

354
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,963
That Egyptian foot ointment
is very good.

355
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,121
Reception in 20.
Then you hand out brochures.

356
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,609
I talked to the Centre Party.
The alliance isn't in danger.

357
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,041
- Did Bremer comment?
- No need to.

358
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,562
TV wants an interview
about straying politicians.

359
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,682
Okay. Let me have it.

360
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,601
- You think I'm handling it wrong.
- No, the voters do.

361
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,210
- Morten Weber.
- Say the car was stolen.

362
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,200
- No. We're helping the police.
- They have their own agenda.

363
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:27,050
- I'm not that kind of politician.
- You may not be one for long.

364
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,368
I want a clear conscience.

365
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,369
Eller's office called.

366
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,967
- She wants to talk.
- Wasn't that solved?

367
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,409
I thought so too.

368
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,766
- Coffee? Tea'?
- No, thanks.

369
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,727
I've met with my group.
I underestimated the case.

370
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,445
How?

371
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,803
This story has fanned
an internal discussion.

372
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,970
They smell blood
and want to go with Bremer.

373
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,561
The car was stolen.
He's innocent.

374
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,890
- Why hasn't that come out'?
- The police have asked us to wait

375
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,048
It won't matter now.

376
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,847
Relax, you and Bremer
don't want the same things.

377
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,408
He's just proposed
10,000 low-rent flats.

378
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,685
Has he?

379
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,042
He won't follow through.

380
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,289
I am sorry. It seems
there won't be an alliance.

381
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,926
Don't you see
that he wants you

382
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,441
to hesitate
and miss the deadline.

383
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,564
The group has decided.
It's out of my hands.

384
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,160
What?

385
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,882
You could top his offer.

386
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,769
Right, but let it pass
and see if it becomes necessary.

387
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,165
You're ruthless.

388
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,765
Just a moment.

389
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,725
- Not now.
- I want an explanation. Now.

390
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,207
Thanks.
Just a moment.

391
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,649
First you steal our proposal

392
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,844
and end up with
an unrealistic number of units.

393
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,964
- Oh, Kirsten!
- You exploit a girl's death.

394
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,003
And time it to create a crisis
when it's about helping people.

395
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,043
Wait just two seconds.

396
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,686
- This has nothing to do with politics.
- How dare you'?

397
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,884
I don't work in the chaotic way
you choose.

398
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,491
Choose?

399
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,286
You had nothing to do
with that car.

400
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,370
If you don't come clean
that's your problem.

401
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,723
And in regard to an alliance
with the Centre Party

402
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,968
I haven't lost all my teeth yet.

403
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,725
Yes, I'm back.

404
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,565
Yes, but it's no good.
I'm going on the TV news.

405
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,446
Those are the funeral hymns.

406
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,042
There are no right or Wrong choices.

407
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,167
It's important to find those hymns
that mean something to you.

408
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,806
Take a hymn book home.

409
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,203
To look at.

410
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,564
I'd like "I Saw a Rose Blossom

411
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,128
That's number 117.
It's a lovely hymn.

412
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,611
It must be beautiful for her
with lots of flowers.

413
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,291
- That's up to you.
- She loved flowers.

414
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,404
Blue irises.

415
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,850
And rushes.

416
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,804
- Anything else we need?
- No.

417
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,490
The eulogy...

418
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,207
I'd suggest you write
something down for me.

419
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,560
When you're at peace at home.

420
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,007
Don't talk about the crime.

421
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,249
I'll talk about Nanna
as you remember her.

422
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,290
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst
for righteousness, for they will be filled.

423
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,086
- She was always happy.
- That's important to mention.

424
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,122
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

425
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,250
You're always Welcome
if you need to talk.

426
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,964
She's happy now.
She's with God.

427
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,402
What good is that to me'?

428
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,966
I want to know.
What good is that to me'?

429
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,522
Life is sometimes meaningless.

430
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,691
It's unbelievably hard
to lose one's daughter.

431
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,641
Faith helps to maintain hope...

432
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,327
and the belief that life after all
isn't meaningless.

433
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,688
What a load of crap!

434
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,890
I don't give a damn
if she's with God.

435
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,404
Do you understand?

436
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,803
She has to be...

437
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,764
with me.

438
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,604
Oliver Schandorff'?

439
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,962
You left early yesterday?

440
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,561
I didn't feel well. I was sad.

441
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,161
- And no school on Monday?
- No.

442
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:23,002
- I had a day off.
- You've had a few. 17%.

443
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,649
I know you think I'm involved
because we fought at the party.

444
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,170
I'm not.
I'd never do anything.

445
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,364
- Why did she break up with you'?
- We grew apart.

446
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,126
You use dope, don't you'?

447
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,527
Is that why she left you'?

448
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,291
You took speed at a concert
and again two months later.

449
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,286
I got a bit carried away.
But that's finished now.

450
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,166
- What did Nanna say'?
- First she thought it was a laugh.

451
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,442
But she got tired of it.

452
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,847
Tell me about the argument.

453
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,444
- I was drunk and stupid.
- What did you do?

454
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,000
I laid it on her.
She was so sweet.

455
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,488
And all the time
I could tell that she was... serene.

456
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,284
- She was happy.
- So you threw a chair?

457
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,209
Yes, regretfully.

458
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,169
- Where were you after 9.30 p.m.?
- In the bar.

459
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,842
- You're not on the roster.
- We overlapped a bit.

460
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,321
Who Would've seen you
in the bar?

461
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,730
- Heaps of people.
- Name one.

462
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,366
- Lisa'?
- She saw me for sure.

463
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,370
No, she's not sure.
No one else saw you.

464
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,562
I collected glasses...

465
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,287
Listen, mate.
No one saw you after 9.30 p.m.

466
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,971
- What did you do?
- Surely someone saw me.

467
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,731
Did you follow her'?
Or wait in the basement'?

468
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,530
No, I didn't.

469
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,120
You were jealous. Right?

470
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,801
You could tell
she had someone else.

471
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,406
- I said...
- You found the car keys'?

472
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,285
- Keys'?
- You knew the oar was outside

473
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,448
- What?
- You tried to score.

474
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,120
She didn't want you
so you raped her.

475
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,448
What? I loved her.

476
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,968
Yes. But she didn't love you.

477
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,288
You're nothing but a loser.

478
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,484
You couldn't measure up.
You raped her.

479
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,480
You tied her up and drove her
somewhere out of earshot.

480
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,682
That's what you did.

481
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,570
Oliver, if you've got something to say
now is the time.

482
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,688
May I have a word?

483
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,804
How dare you'?

484
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,766
- We're interviewing your son.
- I know, he's distraught.

485
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,601
- Maybe you should stop.
- He may be hiding something.

486
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,406
I don't give a damn.
Has he been charged?

487
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,681
No.

488
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,044
Fine. No more interview.

489
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,765
Thanks, Dad.

490
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,124
I'm sorry if I've interrupted
one of your meetings.

491
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,720
Are you involved in this'?

492
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,685
- No.
- I damned well hope not.

493
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,010
Get your things.

494
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,723
You thought I was too hard
on him, right'?

495
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,765
What do you want'?
Is it my fault that idiot turned up'?

496
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,008
I didn't say it was.

497
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,321
You did well, Meyer

498
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,240
- Call him in.
- We need some evidence.

499
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,523
He found the keys.
It was clear he was lying.

500
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,362
Nothing in the basement'?

501
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,087
It's impossible,
tracks like in a public toilet.

502
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,930
Press forensics.

503
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,408
If he drove the car
he must have left traces.

504
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,170
And time the route
from here to the woods.

505
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,204
So you're off
to the Canary Islands, then?

506
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,362
All we need is you two.

507
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,889
Is that necessary?

508
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,206
Yes, I need them for comparison.

509
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,402
Two pairs of pants each?

510
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,008
Yes, that's fine. Thanks.

511
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,689
You'd better be off
so you can get some peace.

512
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,410
Promise to call me
if there's anything.

513
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,002
Look after each other.

514
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,887
Come on. Wash your hands
so we can get going.

515
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,529
I'll just help Vagn empty the car.

516
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,767
Come when you're ready.

517
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,531
- Can we take the kite'?
- Yes, you can.

518
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,169
But don't take any more
or there won't be enough room.

519
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,851
Be sweet and take that one...

520
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,201
What, Mum'?

521
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,565
Run down to Dad.
I'll just be a moment.

522
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,324
- We'll leave you in peace soon.
- What happened in the Woods?

523
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,647
Sorry, I'm not the one to ask.

524
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,291
I'll have to ask you to leave.

525
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,365
I must...

526
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,811
I must know what happened.

527
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,282
What happened to my daughter'?

528
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,841
I'm not allowed...

529
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,963
I saw the photos.

530
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,044
You can't tell me anything
that's Worse than my imagination.

531
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,648
I'm begging you.

532
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,442
Great. Watch it, boys.

533
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,408
Have you heard anything?

534
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,765
- Vagn, how about some money'?
- What?

535
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,883
Do I look like a piggy bank?

536
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,762
Bloody hell.

537
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,522
Here. Buy a chocolate egg.
And one for you.

538
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,562
Emil, not beer.
A Kinder egg, okay?

539
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,287
Theis...

540
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,686
It was the driver, Wasn't it'?

541
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,362
They're sure it's him, eh?

542
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,407
I don't know anything.

543
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,968
He'll end up in prison.

544
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,648
Tell me if I can fix it.

545
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,484
- What are you on about?
- He'll get a ridiculous sentence.

546
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,727
- I want to help
- How'?

547
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,967
I thought...

548
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,846
That we should use pipes
and smash his kneecaps'?

549
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,245
Yes.

550
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,803
She's dead, Vagn.

551
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,843
Don't you understand?

552
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,084
Where is she'?

553
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,051
Pernille'?

554
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,522
- We're not leaving.
- Why not? I just told them...

555
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,371
She was alive when the car
hit the water.

556
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,561
What?

557
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,207
She Wasn't dead, Theis.
She was lying alone in...

558
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,370
the trunk, waiting all alone...

559
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,008
We'll have to stay here.

560
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,842
I want them to find him.

561
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,446
I want...

562
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,961
He must be found now, Theis.

563
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,844
We must top Bremer
or Eller goes to him.

564
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,601
We can't. Bremer's flung
an astronomical figure...

565
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,881
Troels...

566
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,481
They have other key issues.

567
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,570
She might compromise
if she can save face.

568
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,922
Find something we can live with.

569
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,209
Nothing too big.

570
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,049
And in a hurry...
so Bremer doesn't get wind of it first

571
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,767
- Does he sit in on our meetings?
- That's just it.

572
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,331
I got a copy
of the server's log files.

573
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,046
What?

574
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,811
- I decided for you.
- I didn't want this.

575
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,970
Never mind, I know
who mailed the journalist.

576
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,764
Never mind'?

577
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,601
- You went behind my back.
- It was Morten.

578
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,805
It was sent from Morten's mail.
There's no doubt it's him.

579
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,802
I think I've got it.

580
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,566
Okay, Morten.

581
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,651
- We can find a compromise.
- Let's look at it.

582
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:30,207
A perforated lung, blood pressure
70 over 40 and he's saturated.

583
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,446
- I can't justify it.
- Five minutes.

584
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:37,964
- We've doubled his morphine.
- I'm here because it's important.

585
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,523
- He's in room four.
- Thank you.

586
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,405
John?

587
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,687
I'm sorry about what happened.

588
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,008
Do you understand me'?

589
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,961
I know you didn't harm the girl.

590
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,728
I need your help.

591
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,565
What happened at the school
on Friday?

592
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,963
Who did you meet
and Where did you lose the keys'?

593
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,127
You parked and went inside.

594
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,881
Then you went to the gym
and felt sick there?

595
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,046
Yes.

596
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,446
What?

597
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,407
John?

598
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,125
The basement.

599
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,244
You went to the basement first?

600
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,011
To deliver the posters.

601
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,168
That's where you lost the keys'?

602
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,770
He got upset.

603
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,965
- I was not allowed there.
- Who got upset and said that?

604
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,245
John?
Was it in the bicycle basement'?

605
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,002
- No.
- Any bicycles there?

606
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,202
Not the bicycle basement.

607
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,321
The one next to it.

608
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,769
The boiler room.

609
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,087
Who did you meet
in the boiler room?

610
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,404
Was it him'? Oliver Schandorff'?
Was it him'?

611
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,884
Are you sure'?

612
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,808
- It Wasn't him.
- Look carefully at the photo.

613
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,165
- Please go now.
- One minute. I'm almost ready.

614
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,645
- Did you hear me'?
- Almost there.

615
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,801
Was he the one you met
in the basement'?

616
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,610
- It's ready.
- Thanks.

617
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,121
- Have a nice evening.
- You too.

618
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,407
Are you still at the school?

619
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,171
Yes, We're finished
and I'm starving.

620
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,569
- Go back to the basement.
- Bloody hell. Why'?

621
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,560
- Forensics are packing up
- Ask them to wait.

622
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,481
- Is there a boiler room?
- I have no idea.

623
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,445
- Are you there?
- Relax, damn you.

624
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:53,281
- I'm on my way.
- Find a door to a boiler room.

625
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,563
- Here's a door.
- I must know What's inside.

626
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,842
Okay, damn it.

627
