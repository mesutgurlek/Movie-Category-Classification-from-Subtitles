Al was killed with my gun.

319
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:19,772
Jack, there's an official
department policy about cop killings.

320
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,108
Now, cop killers represent
a special priority,

321
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,610
because any man crazy
enough to kill a cop

322
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,529
is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian.

323
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,738
-Right.
-ln other words,

324
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,031
we can't seem like
we're in the revenge business.

325
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,116
Mmm-hmm.

326
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,076
And we all know
the truth's a little different.

327
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,285
Yeah?

328
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,247
Anything's bothering you
besides losing your gun?

329
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,249
Yeah, it bothers me
when cops get killed.

a little more of a team player

Oh, l'm helping you, huh?

471
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,046
Slow down. Right there, 232.

472
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,843
What's the chances he's packed?

473
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,177
Been a while since l worked with him.

474
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,179
l'd say
chances are probably about 1 00%.

475
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,848
You better leave me a gun
or something, man.

476
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,725
l ain't sitting out here without no gun.

477
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,144
Sure thing, asshole.

478
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,355
Now, you just hang on.

479
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,069
Hope this big move of yours
turns out to be something.

481
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,497
What's happening, Luther?

482
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,458
l'm sorry about the door, man.
Did that hurt?

483
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,669
lt looked real painful
when you slammed into it.

484
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,466
Luther, l'm talking to you. Luther. Luther!

485
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,344
Hammond! Drop that goddamn gun!

486
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,846
Hey, man, that's a dangerous game
you're playing, man.

487
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,306
Don't point that gun at me, all right?

488
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,642
Don't point your goddamn gun at me,
all right?

489
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,019
Hand me that gun or you're dead.

490
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,415
l'm looking for Ganz. Where is he?

491
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,293
Ganz? Haven't seen him for years.

492
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,503
That's the truth.

493
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,421
Look, asshole,
you just took a shot at me.

494
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,715
l think you do know where Ganz is.

495
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,385
Who gives a fuck what you think?

496
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,476
Yo, Luther, man,
you better tell this boy something.

497
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,145
He's having a ball with this car door.

498
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,402
Luther! Are you angry with me?

499
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,655
l don't know
what you're smiling at, watermelon.

500
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,408
Your big move just turned out to be shit.

501
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,493
LUTHER: All right, all right, all right!

502
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,496
Yeah, if l defend myself,
l'm resisting arrest, right?

503
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,873
Officer, l want to make a citizen's arrest!

504
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,166
Shut up!

What you got here, Jack?

506
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,170
l got a punk here carrying
a concealed weapon...

507
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,672
LUTHER: All you cops are faggots!

508
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,424
Resisting arrest.

509
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,010
l'll think up some more,
file a report tomorrow.

-l bet you will.
-Yeah, l will. Get him out of here.

511

Man, give me a 9:00 wake-up call.

512

Good-bye, Luther!

513

l don't need a friend like you, Reggie!

514
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,229
When do l get my phone call?
Let me get my lawyer here!

515

You're gonna be in trouble!

-WOMAN: Get your hands off me!

in some need of assistance.

We don't need some tight-assed,

Sweetheart, l'm not here to bullshit you.

l don't know whether or not
you ladies know,

This is Jack Cates. Any messages?

Oh, just one.

00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,111
Some lady called,
says she's a little hotheaded sometimes,

but she still wants
her occasional roommate.

Come on, Jack. You're making me work
too goddamn hard at this!

Listen, god damn it.

l'm happy about it, you're nuts!

542

This is not the way

Want to hop up on the counter?

Stop moaning.

You know, speaking of moaning,
my stomach is starting to growl.

-We better go get something to eat.
-We eat when l say we eat.

-Hey, now, that's bullshit.
-That's the last straw, all right?

560
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,882
l want some food now.

561
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,135

you take me back to the penitentiary

and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye,
all right?

You took me out here,

Who was that you called back
on the phone, Jack?

575

None of your goddamn business.

Just get in the car
and keep your mouth shut.

Come on, man, l think it was your lady.

Why don't you tell me
something about her?

579

What's her problem, besides you?

580
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:23,430
She got the same problem
as half the goddamn population.

581

Can't get a job she's trained for,
and it pisses her off.

right, Jack?

make me for a cop right away.

came to fuck with me and my friends,

619

only thing that stopped us
from kicking their ass,

620

they had guns and badges.

621
