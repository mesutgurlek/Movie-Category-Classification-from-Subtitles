1121
01:08:24,047 --> 01:08:26,049
- I AM.
- YOU SAID YOU WERE PRACTICING.

1122
01:08:26,049 --> 01:08:29,552
- WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE ?
  WE'RE PLAYIN' A GAME.
- MONKEY-FUCKIN' FOOTBALL.

1123
01:08:30,053 --> 01:08:33,556
BRETT.  JOIN US.
TAKE A CHAIR.

1124
01:08:33,556 --> 01:08:36,559
- PASS.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, YOU MIGHT
  ENJOY YOURSELF ?  IT'S OKAY.

1125
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:39,562
YOU'RE ALLOWED.
I DON'T WANNA PLAY WITH YOU,
CHARLIE.  [ Whispers ]  SORRY.

1126
01:08:39,562 --> 01:08:43,066
- REST OF YOU FAGS WANNA PLAY,
  GO AHEAD.  HAVE FUN.
- THANKS, BRETT, THAT'S--

1127
01:08:43,566 --> 01:08:47,070
NO FRATERNIZING, EH ?
OH, WELL.  HAVE IT YOURWAY.

1128
01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:51,574
OKAY, BRETT'S OUT.
FIVE-CARD DRAW.

1129
01:08:51,574 --> 01:08:53,576
SAY, ACES, DEUCES,

1130
01:08:53,576 --> 01:08:57,580
ONE-EYED JACKS
AND SUICIDE KINGS ARE WILD.

1131
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:01,084
- IRA, THAT'S THE WHOLE DECK.
- SO WHAT ?  IT'S MY GAME,
  MY RULES.

1132
01:09:01,084 --> 01:09:04,087
IRA, THERE'S NO CHALLENGE
IN THAT.  THAT'S LIKE--

1133
01:09:04,087 --> 01:09:08,091
GENTLEMEN, KEEP IN MIND THAT
THE CARDS YOU HOLD IN YOUR HANDS
ARE NOTHING BUT DUMB LUCK.

1134
01:09:08,091 --> 01:09:13,596
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WINNING
AND LOSING IS BEING ABLE
TO READ YOUR OPPONENT.

1135
01:09:14,097 --> 01:09:19,102
THAT'S WHY I'M STILL HERE.
A NUMBER OF TIMES THE ONLY THING
KEPT ME OUT OF A SATIN BOX...

1136
01:09:19,102 --> 01:09:24,107
WAS I COULD SIZE UP THE
OTHER GUY MAYBE HALF A SECOND
QUICKER THAN HE COULD ME.

1137
01:09:24,107 --> 01:09:27,610
[ Laughs ]  WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT ?
YOU'RE TAPED TO A CHAIR.

1138
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:32,115
YOU SAW US COMIN' A MILE AWAY
AT THE PLAZA, DIDN'T YOU ?

1139
01:09:32,115 --> 01:09:37,120
I ADMIT...
I'M OUT OF PRACTICE.
[ Laughter ]

1140
01:09:39,622 --> 01:09:42,125
IRA... GIVE ME FOUR CARDS.

1141
01:09:42,125 --> 01:09:44,627
OH, SORRY, SIR.
NO OFFENSE.

1142
01:09:44,627 --> 01:09:47,630
- WELL, YOU GAVE ME SIX.
- TAKE IRA, FOR EXAMPLE.

1143
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:50,133
I TRUST IRA.
[ Laughing ]

1144
01:09:50,516 --> 01:09:54,020
- YOU DO ?
- WE'RE PLAYIN' POKER.
  HE'S LOSIN' HIS SHIRT.

1145
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:59,025
YET, IRA'S EYES DON'T FLOAT.
HE'S GOT HIS SENSE OF FAIR PLAY.

1146
01:09:59,025 --> 01:10:02,528
AS WE ALL KNOW,
IRA CAN'T BLUFF HIS WAY
OUT OF A PAPER BAG.

1147
01:10:03,029 --> 01:10:05,031
I CAN TELL YOU HIS BET
BEFORE HE COULD.

1148
01:10:05,031 --> 01:10:08,534
WELL, COULD YOU ?
'CAUSE I COULD USE
THE HELP HERE, CHARLIE.

1149
01:10:08,534 --> 01:10:11,037
[ Charlie ]
LOOK AT AVERY.

1150
01:10:11,037 --> 01:10:13,039
HE'S HAVIN' A TOUGH TIME
HATIN' ME.

1151
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:17,043
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A REAL HATE-ON TO DO
WHAT YOU DID TO ME.

1152
01:10:17,043 --> 01:10:20,546
INTEGRITY KEEPS GETTIN'
IN AVERY'S WAY.

1153
01:10:21,047 --> 01:10:24,050
NOW HE WANTS US TO BELIEVE
HE'S A MIND READER.

1154
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:28,054
- THAT'S RIGHT.
-[ Ira ]  I FOLD.

1155
01:10:28,054 --> 01:10:31,557
- IRA, NO ONE OPENED.
- SORRY.

1156
01:10:31,557 --> 01:10:34,560
- I'LL OPEN.
- THAT MAKES SENSE.

1157
01:10:35,061 --> 01:10:37,563
- FOLD.
- THAT ALSO MAKES SENSE.

1158
01:10:37,563 --> 01:10:41,567
HOW ABOUT BRETT,
CONTROL JUNKIE ?

1159
01:10:41,567 --> 01:10:44,070
BRETT CAN'T LEAVE
ANYTHING TO CHANCE.
LOOK AT HIM.

1160
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:48,074
HE WOULDN'T EVEN PLAY,
UNLESS HE'S LOOKING ACROSS
THE TABLE AT A SURE THING.

1161
01:10:48,074 --> 01:10:52,578
I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS SHIT.
I'M OUTTA HERE.

1162
01:10:52,578 --> 01:10:56,082
I THOUGHT HE'D NEVER LEAVE.

1163
01:10:56,082 --> 01:10:59,085
YOU'RE 180 OFF ON BRETT.
HE'S A WILD MAN.

1164
01:10:59,085 --> 01:11:02,088
WE'RE IN ATLANTIC CITY,
I HAD TO LOCK HIM IN A ROOM.

1165
01:11:02,088 --> 01:11:04,590
WHAT HAPPENED ?  HE DROPPED
A COUPLE OF QUARTERS
IN THE SLOTS ?

1166
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:08,094
-[ Charlie Laughs ]
- HUH !  ABOUT 48,000 QUARTERS.

1167
01:11:08,594 --> 01:11:12,598
WE DROVE DOWN TO JERSEY
ON MEMORIAL DAY.

1168
01:11:12,598 --> 01:11:15,101
- LABOR DAY.
- UH--

1169
01:11:15,101 --> 01:11:18,604
WHATEVER.  JUST SHUT UP,
OKAY ?  I'M TRYIN' TO TELL
A STORY HERE.

1170
01:11:19,105 --> 01:11:21,107
- IRA.
- WHAT ?

1171
01:11:21,107 --> 01:11:26,112
YOU CAN'T TELL A STORY HERE.
YOU CAN'T TELL A STORY ANYWHERE.
YOU SCREW IT UP EVERY TIME.

1172
01:11:26,112 --> 01:11:29,115
- NO, I DO NOT.
- YOU'RE DOING IT NOW.

1173
01:11:29,115 --> 01:11:32,618
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU GUYS
INTERRUPT EVERY TIME.
I CAN'T KEEP MY PLACE.

1174
01:11:32,618 --> 01:11:36,122
I FORGET WHERE I WAS.
IF YOU GET THE GODDAMN
STORY STRAIGHT,

1175
01:11:36,122 --> 01:11:38,624
WE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO INTERRUPT YOU TO GET
THE GODDAMN STORY STRAIGHT.

1176
01:11:38,624 --> 01:11:42,628
- WELL, IS SOMEBODY GOING
  TO TELL A STORY ?
- I WAS TELLING THE STORY !

1177
01:11:42,628 --> 01:11:45,631
JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP.
I'LL TELL IT.
YOU FUCK IT UP EVERY TIME.

1178
01:11:46,132 --> 01:11:48,134
IT WAS LABOR DAY, IRA,
LIKE T.K. SAID.

1179
01:11:48,634 --> 01:11:51,637
IT WAS SCORCHIN' OUTSIDE,
IT WAS SO FUCKIN' HOT.
DON'T YOU REMEMBER THAT ?

1180
01:11:51,754 --> 01:11:54,757
THE ROOM WAS FREEZIN' THOUGH.
YOU COULD HANG MEAT IN THIS 
ROOM, IT WAS SO DAMN COLD.

1181
01:11:54,757 --> 01:11:57,760
IT WAS GOOD FOR BUSINESS.
 IT KEEPS YOU AWAKE.

1182
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,263
WE'RE POUNDIN' SAUCE.
FREE BOOZE.
WHAT THEY LOSE ON THAT...

1183
01:12:00,263 --> 01:12:02,265
THEY MAKE UP
ON JOHNNY WALKER JUDGMENT.

1184
01:12:02,265 --> 01:12:05,768
IT'S GETTIN' REALLY LATE.
THE SUN'S ABOUT TO COME UP.
WE'D ALL LOST OUR SHIRTS.

1185
01:12:05,768 --> 01:12:08,771
MAXED OUT THE PLASTIC.
EXCEPT FOR BRETT.

1186
01:12:08,771 --> 01:12:11,274
BRETT'S WINNIN',
LIKE, HUGE.

1187
01:12:13,276 --> 01:12:15,278
THAT'S WHEN IT HAPPENED.

1188
01:12:16,779 --> 01:12:18,781
CHANGING OF THE GUARD.

1189
01:12:19,282 --> 01:12:21,284
[ Man ]
NO-O-O !
[ Coughs ]

1190
01:12:21,284 --> 01:12:24,287
WORD HAD IT THEY BROUGHT
THIS GUY IN FROM VEGAS
AFTER TWO SUICIDES.

1191
01:12:24,287 --> 01:12:28,291
IT'S THE GUY THEY BROUGHT
IN TO COOL THE TABLE DOWN.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL HIM ?

1192
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:30,293
HELLO, BOYS !
THE WIDOWMAKER.

1193
01:12:30,793 --> 01:12:33,796
WHAT A LITTLE SHIT
THIS GUY WAS.

1194
01:12:33,796 --> 01:12:36,299
IT'S LIKE THE KID
THAT REMINDS THE TEACHER
ABOUT THE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT.

1195
01:12:36,299 --> 01:12:38,801
OH !
WELL, THAT'S THIS KID
GROWN UP.

1196
01:12:40,803 --> 01:12:44,307
ANYWAY, BRETT'S 22 GRAND AHEAD,
SO I FIGURE IT'S SAFE
TO GO TO THE JOHN, RIGHT ?

1197
01:12:44,307 --> 01:12:47,810
WRONG.  GONE FIVE MINUTES,
I COME BACK, HE'S DOWN 12.

1198
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:51,314
I TRY TO TALK HIM INTO
CHANGING TABLES, BUT HE
TAKES OUT A MARKER.

1199
01:12:51,314 --> 01:12:55,818
YOU FUCKIN' BELIEVE THAT ?
[ Men ]
OH-H-H !

1200
01:12:55,818 --> 01:13:00,823
RIGHT THEN AVERY WALKS UP.
HE'S JUST GOT DONE SWEATIN' OUT
THE GEORGETOWN-MISSISSIPI GAME,

1201
01:13:00,823 --> 01:13:03,826
BUT AT TEN TO ONE,
HE'S COME OUT FIVE GRAND AHEAD.

1202
01:13:04,327 --> 01:13:07,830
HE TAKES ONE LOOK AT THIS LITTLE
WIMP, AND HE DUMPS HIS FIVE Gs
RIGHT ON TOP OF BRETT'S ACTION.

1203
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:11,834
THESE CLOWNS, THEY'RE GONNA
TAKE THE WIDOWMAKER'S BALLS HOME
AND HIS LUGGAGE WITH ONE HAND.

1204
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:15,838
SO WHAT DOES
BRETT THE GENIUS DO ?
HE DOUBLES DOWN !

1205
01:13:15,838 --> 01:13:20,343
WIDOWMAKER LOOKED HIM
RIGHT IN THE EYE,
AND HE DREW ONE CARD.

1206
01:13:20,343 --> 01:13:24,230
WHOA-HO-HO-HO-HO !
SORRY !
[ Mock Crying ]

1207
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:27,233
I'M SORRY.
GIMME THE MONEY !

1208
01:13:27,233 --> 01:13:30,353
THE GUY, HE'S--
HE'S GOT ROCKS
THE SIZE OF RUSHMORE.

1209
01:13:30,353 --> 01:13:35,358
OH, COME ON GUYS !  DON'T LEAVE.
WEREN'T WE JUST HAVIN'
A GOOD TIME ?  COME ON !

1210
01:13:35,358 --> 01:13:39,862
COME ON, COME ON !
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA !
[ Barking, Laughing ]

1211
01:13:39,979 --> 01:13:41,981
AFTERWARDS, BRETT TAKES
HIS LAST 200 BUCKS,

1212
01:13:41,981 --> 01:13:46,486
HE TAKES US ALL OUT FOR STEAKS
THE SIZE OF YOUR FOOT.
[ Charlie ]  WHAT A GUY.

1213
01:13:46,486 --> 01:13:52,492
HE DROPS 20 GRAND, HE AIN'T GOT
MONEY LEFT FOR A BUS TICKET
HOME, HE TAKES YOU FOR STEAKS.

1214
01:13:52,492 --> 01:13:56,496
IT MUST BE NICE
TO HAVE RICH FOLKS.
YOU DON'T KNOW HIS FATHER.

1215
01:13:56,496 --> 01:13:59,499
HE'S GOT THE FIRST NICKEL
HE EVER MADE.

1216
01:13:59,499 --> 01:14:03,002
SO, HOW'S HE GONNA PAY BACK
THE 20 LARGE ?

1217
01:14:03,002 --> 01:14:06,005
THE INTEREST ALONE IS ENOUGH
TO GIVE YOU A NOSEBLEED.

1218
01:14:10,009 --> 01:14:12,645
WHAT ?

1219
01:14:13,146 --> 01:14:15,648
MY ARM, IT'S KILLING ME.

1220
01:14:16,149 --> 01:14:18,151
LOOSEN THE TAPE.
IT'S FALLING OFF.

1221
01:14:21,771 --> 01:14:25,274
SO, YOU KNOW WHAT ?
HOW YA FEELIN' ?

1222
01:14:25,274 --> 01:14:27,777
THAT'S IT.
OOH !  YEAH.
YEAH ?

1223
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:34,283
COUPLE MINUTES.
TRY TO KEEP IT LEVEL.
OOH, YEAH.

1224
01:14:34,784 --> 01:14:37,787
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' ?
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOIN' ?
NO, NO, NO !
HEY !

1225
01:14:38,287 --> 01:14:41,290
- NO !
- YOU FUCKER !  I WAS SITTIN'
  ON A STRAIGHT FLUSH THERE !

1226
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:44,794
BRETT, WILL YOU RELAX ?  HE
DOESN'T HAVE THE BLOOD PRESSURE
TO WALK AROUND THE ROOM !

1227
01:14:44,794 --> 01:14:48,297
LOOK AT HIM !
WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT ?
WE HAD A FUCKIN' PLAN !

1228
01:14:48,297 --> 01:14:50,800
THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT !
I WANT TO STICK TO THE PLAN !

1229
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:55,805
- UH, MAYBE THAT'S NOT ALL
  YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT, HUH ?
- WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN ?

1230
01:14:55,805 --> 01:14:58,307
GO AHEAD, T.K.
ASK HIM.

1231
01:14:58,808 --> 01:15:02,311
ASK ME WHAT ?
 ASK ME WHAT ?
GO ON, T.K.  T.K. !

1232
01:15:02,311 --> 01:15:04,814
SHUT UP !
ASK ME WHAT ?

1233
01:15:04,814 --> 01:15:06,816
JUST ANSWER THIS QUESTION,
OKAY ?

1234
01:15:07,316 --> 01:15:12,321
ALL THAT MONEY IN ATLANTIC CITY
THAT YOU LOST-- HOW WERE YOU
GONNA PAY IT BACK ?

1235
01:15:12,321 --> 01:15:17,326
- YEAH, HOW WERE YOU
  GONNA PAY THAT BACK, HUH ?
- NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.  WHY ?

1236
01:15:17,326 --> 01:15:20,329
WELL, YOU SEE,
IT'S BEEN BROUGHT
TO CHARLIE'S ATTENTION...

1237
01:15:20,329 --> 01:15:23,833
THAT ONE OF US MIGHT BE
IN ON ELISE'S KIDNAPPING.

1238
01:15:25,334 --> 01:15:28,337
[ Laughing ]
WHAT ?
YEAH.
WELL, THAT'S HOW I FELT.

1239
01:15:28,337 --> 01:15:31,340
BUT, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT CRAZY.

1240
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:34,343
AND, UH, $20,000
IS A LOT OF MONEY.

1241
01:15:34,343 --> 01:15:37,847
SO, IF YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO HIDE, YOU SHOULD HAVE
NO PROBLEM TELLING US...

1242
01:15:37,847 --> 01:15:40,349
HOW YOU WERE GONNA
PAY IT BACK, RIGHT ?

1243
01:15:40,349 --> 01:15:45,354
IRA, YOU'RE MY FRIEND.
LISTEN:  SHUT THE FUCK UP !
SHUT UP !

1244
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:47,857
- HE SOUNDS GUILTY TO ME.
- IRA !

1245
01:15:47,857 --> 01:15:49,859
-FUCKIN' FAGGOT !  COME HERE !
- HEY, HEY, HEY !

1246
01:15:49,859 --> 01:15:54,363
HEY, BRETT !  COME ON !
AVERY, AVERY.  OOH.
DON'T TELL ME...

1247
01:15:54,363 --> 01:15:56,365
YOUR BUYIN' INTO THIS FUCKIN'
LOAD OF BULLSHIT !

1248
01:15:56,365 --> 01:15:59,368
HE'S MAKIN' UP STORIES
TO SAVE HIS OWN ASS !

1249
01:15:59,368 --> 01:16:01,871
LOOK, YOU CALM DOWN,
ALL RIGHT ?

1250
01:16:01,871 --> 01:16:05,875
