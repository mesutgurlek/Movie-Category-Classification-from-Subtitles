As in every stone of this size,
there is a flaw.

3
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:40,689
- A flaw?
- The slightest flaw, Your Excellency.

4
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:45,289
If you look deep into the stone, you will
perceive the tiniest discolouration.

5
00:00:45,373 --> 00:00:47,841
It resembles an animal.

6
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:50,731
- An animal?
- A leaping panther.

7
00:00:52,173 --> 00:00:54,641
Yes, a pink panther.

8
00:00:58,373 --> 00:01:00,364
Come here, Dala.

9
00:01:05,493 --> 00:01:10,283
A gift to your father from his grateful
people. Someday it will be yours.

10

The most fabulous diamond

Thanks a lot. Don't forget
to take the wardrobe back.

15
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:57,764
- How do you want them?
- I want it right away. I'm in a hurry.

16
00:06:57,853 --> 00:07:00,606
You can't rush a genius.

17
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:02,649
I'll rush.

18
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:05,725

about the wardrobe.

- <i>(Pierre)</i> Who is it?

- Where's who?
- George Lytton.

25

He owes me 40 grand,
and nobody welshes on Big Joe.

26

Look, Big Joe. I'm not a bill collector,
I'm a photographer. I just took his picture.

- Graduation picture.

- Graduation.

Get him!

They're worth half a million.
We'll take 300,000.

31
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:33,731
I'll do what I can,
but the merchandise is extremely hot.

- <i>Pardon, madame.</i>
- Certainly.

We must find that woman.

- What was that?
- We don't have much of a description.

40
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:16,213
About 5ft 7, black hair,
wearing a light-beige coat.

41
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:19,046
They let that fence escape.
He might have talked.

42
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:22,603
- We will catch him.
- We must. We must find that woman.

43
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:25,207
She is our first link with the Phantom.

All right, Henri, that will be all.

Hello, Duchess.
So glad you could come. Have fun.

Yes?

Hello there. I can't tell you
what an honour this is.

- Thank you.

- Help! Help! Help!
- <i>(Amber yaps)</i>

Somebody's taking my sleigh. Amber!

75
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:47,772
- Amber?
- My dog.

76
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,208
Leave this to me, ma'am.

77
00:14:56,893 --> 00:14:58,645
- What happened?
- I don't know.

78
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:02,567
Suddenly there was a man with a gun
and he took the sleigh and Amber.

<i>(yells)</i>

Oh!

82
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:19,970
- I'm sorry.
- Oh!

83
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:25,047
Excuse me, my leg is caught.
I apologise for this inconvenience.

84
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:28,373
- Do you know that was Sir Charles?
- Sir Charles?

85
00:15:28,453 --> 00:15:30,842
Sir Charles Lytton. Yes? Hm?

00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:34,721
Oh! I am Inspector Clouseau.
This is Madame Clouseau.

Thank you.

88
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:45,849
I'm sorry, my darling.

89
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:49,482
- That's all right, my darling.
- Excuse me.

90
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:53,566
- Do you know that you're really amazing?
- So you've said.

91
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:57,931
How you can manage on
a police inspector's salary!

92
00:15:58,013 --> 00:16:02,689
How many women could save enough out
of the housekeeping to buy a mink coat?

93
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:07,051
- Well, it's not easy.
- You are a constant contradiction.

94
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,601
I'm simply a woman in love, my darling.

95
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:11,684
My darling.

96
00:16:15,173 --> 00:16:19,485
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, my darling.
Please, excuse me.

97
00:16:19,573 --> 00:16:21,803
It's perfectly all right.

98
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:24,088
Did I hurt you? Are you all right?

99
00:16:24,173 --> 00:16:26,846
- Yes, I'm fine.
- You're sure now?

100
00:16:26,933 --> 00:16:29,731
My darling, I'm so sorry.

101
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:33,885
Darling, I have a little business
with the manager.

102
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:36,965
- Yes?
- Ooh.

103
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:41,524
After which, I'll return to you
immediately... my darling.

104
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:57,604
All right.

105
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:24,484
Hello.

106
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:27,690
- How did it go?
- Perfectly.

107

<i>(knock at door)</i>

108
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,724
Come in.

109
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,492
Princess Dala is concerned
about your injuries.

110
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:49,282
Please thank her and say there's
nothing to be concerned about.

111
00:17:49,373 --> 00:17:51,329
It's really not too serious.

112
00:17:51,413 --> 00:17:55,201
In that case, Her Highness
has instructed me to invite you for dinner.

113
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:59,286
- Eight o'clock at her chalet.
- Thank the princess. I'd be delighted.

114
00:18:07,573 --> 00:18:09,848
- <i>Ispettore.</i>
- <i>Buongiorno.</i>

115
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:13,282
You know Signor Tucker from Lloyd's.

116
00:18:13,373 --> 00:18:15,125
- Hello.
- Hello, old bean.

117
00:18:15,213 --> 00:18:17,852
- You insure the Pink Panther.
- For half a million.

118
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,571
- Pounds?
- Sterling.

119
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:23,726
The Phantom could not resist the
Pink Panther. He will make an attempt.

120
00:18:23,813 --> 00:18:26,373
But when he does,
I shall be waiting for him.

121
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:29,729
Your theory is the Phantom
is one of Miss Dunning's guests?

122
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:34,489
That is the theory. I want the guests'
names, also the locations of their rooms.

123
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,484
Of course.

124
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:41,044
- Princess Dala has the jewel with her?
- She'd only tell me it was in a safe place.

125
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:45,524
- If it isn't here, it's at her villa in Rome.
- My men are watching that villa.

126
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:48,730
With such planning,
how can the Phantom succeed?

127
00:18:48,813 --> 00:18:51,805
With such planning,
he's succeeded for 20 years.

128
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:55,203
It's a great mistake to underestimate him.

129
00:18:55,293 --> 00:18:58,012
The shrewdest,
cleverest criminal in the world.

130
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:00,891
- And you have never seen him?
- I've seen him once.

131
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,443
Five years ago I got a fleeting glimpse...

132
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:07,764
Excuse me. A fleeting glimpse
as he made his getaway.

133
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:11,971
In a strange way, one has to admire
this man, his - how would you say? -

134
00:19:12,053 --> 00:19:14,806
unique flair for the dramatic.

135
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:19,125
- He actually waved goodbye to me.
- Fascinating.

136
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:25,209
But this time, gentlemen, I shall be waving
goodbye to him... on his way to prison.

137
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:29,684
Good evening.

138
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,848
Make yourself comfortable.
Her Highness will join you. A drink?

139
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:38,401
I'd like a brandy, thank you.

140
00:19:44,653 --> 00:19:46,644
<i>(door closes)</i>

141
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:55,648
- Your Highness.
- Good evening, Sir Charles.

142
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:58,611
Any news from the police
about your dear little dog?

143
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:00,809
They expect I'll receive a ransom note.

144
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:03,691
I am deeply grateful
for what you tried to do.

145
00:20:03,773 --> 00:20:06,731
Ma'am, it was nothing. Nothing.

146
00:20:06,813 --> 00:20:09,566
- Thank you.
- Please sit down.

147
00:20:09,653 --> 00:20:11,723
- Aren't you drinking?
- I don't drink.

148
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:13,531
Not ever?

149
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:17,891
I'm quite content with reality.
I have no need for escape.

150
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:23,843
I enjoy reality. It's just that in my case
reality includes a good stiff belt.

151
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:27,369
- On the other hand, I don't smoke.
- It's a nasty habit.

152
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:31,492
Here's to all those nasty little habits
that we hold so dear. <i>Lechaim!</i>

153
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:33,450
I beg your pardon?

154
00:20:34,773 --> 00:20:39,722
Let's just say it means "Your health,
and thank you for inviting me to dinner."

155
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:44,204
It's not often I have the chance
to dine alone with a beautiful princess.

156

I hate to disappoint you, Sir Charles,
but I'm afraid this isn't the night.

- We're having dinner, but not alone.

160
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:05,168
At last! Hello. We've been through
icicles up to our you-know-whats.

161
00:21:05,253 --> 00:21:11,249
Your Highness, I think it's just too
darling of you to invite me here tonight.

162
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,893
You've just made Cortina for me.

163

Hello, dear boy. Uh-uh-uh-uh.

164

Now, don't you move a muscle, darling.

165
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:24,127
Isn't he wonderful, Your Highness?
Such a magnificent sacrifice.

166
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:29,724
Good evening, sir.

- Yes, of course, my darling.

- There you are, my love.
- Thank you.

Thank you.

- My pleasure.
- Thank you very much.

174

I'm looking for my uncle,
Sir Charles Lytton.

175
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:27,252
- Darling!
- May I get you some water?

176
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:32,001
- Hold your hands over your head.
- Yes. And bend forward.

177
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:35,165
- Ooh! Darling, I am sorry.
- Are you all right?

178
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,721
You all right, my darling?

179
00:22:40,053 --> 00:22:43,011
- I'll be right back.
- Yes, darling.

180
00:22:52,493 --> 00:22:54,290
Please.

181
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:06,003
She's got a cough in the throat, you know.

182
00:23:12,413 --> 00:23:15,371
What do you think?
She turned out to be a man.

183
00:23:15,453 --> 00:23:17,648
It's true. It's quite true.

184
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:20,691
Your Highness, you must
let me give you a party.

185
00:23:20,773 --> 00:23:24,561
I can positively guarantee
it'll be a party to end all parties.

186
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,247
- I'm sure.
- Perhaps Her Highness has other plans.

187
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:31,292
On the contrary, it sounds like fun.
Will you include Sir Charles?

188
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:36,404
No. Charles is having a fling in Capri.
He has his own parties.

189
00:23:36,493 --> 00:23:38,723
Yes. I've read about his parties.

190
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:43,409
They're wonderful. We call him the
Juggler. I've never known a man like him.

191
00:23:43,493 --> 00:23:47,281
He can keep ten girls in the air at once
and make each one happy.

192
00:23:47,373 --> 00:23:50,570
- Amazing. A contemporary Don Juan.
- That's it.

193
00:23:50,653 --> 00:23:55,602
Ah, there's a difference. Don Juan was
forced to climb balconies and fight duels,

194
00:23:55,693 --> 00:23:59,368
and, as I understand it,
to keep his women separate and apart.

195
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:05,130
Now, Charles drives a Ferrari, enters with
a key, and resorts to collective bargaining.

196
00:24:05,213 --> 00:24:06,566
Ooh!

197
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:10,407
- But they have something in common.
- What's that, Your Highness?

198
00:24:10,493 --> 00:24:12,085
Maybe it's best forgotten.

199
00:24:12,173 --> 00:24:16,689
Don't be silly. Charles doesn't mind.
Everyone takes a pot shot at Charles.

200
00:24:16,773 --> 00:24:19,731
- Go ahead, ma'am. Shoot.
- It seems to me,

201
00:24:19,813 --> 00:24:24,443
any middle-aged bachelor who has never
desired the rewards of wife and family,

202
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:29,766
and occupies the major portion of his life
making one conquest after another,

203
00:24:29,853 --> 00:24:33,243
is trying to prove something
that he can never possibly prove.

204
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,369
- And what's that?
- That he's a man.

205
00:24:35,453 --> 00:24:37,603
Oh, you're joking!

206
00:24:38,413 --> 00:24:42,247
- It's complicated, but basically sound.
- Well, Charles?

207
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:46,485
Not very original. That theory
has become rather a tired Freudian cliché.

208
00:24:46,573 --> 00:24:49,246
- But true.
- I've never been on the couch.

- I'm sorry. Another time.

Why don't you come up here?
My leg is only bad if I walk too much,

the walking and I could do the drinking.

00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:20,128
- I'm not a queen.
- <i>(chuckles)</i> That's only half an answer.

306
00:35:20,213 --> 00:35:23,410
The strong-willed ruler,
sitting in her ivory tower,

307
00:35:23,493 --> 00:35:27,168
untouched, unwed and unapproachable?

308
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:31,683
If you had known my father,
you would understand me.

309
00:35:31,773 --> 00:35:35,812
He was an absolute ruler.
He governed his people with an iron hand.

310
00:35:35,893 --> 00:35:39,010
But he gave me a white pony
for my fifth birthday.

311
00:35:39,093 --> 00:35:41,243
He was wrong about many things,

312
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:45,645
but he made his decisions according
to the ways of his predecessors.

313
00:35:45,733 --> 00:35:51,285
I learned the way of the West, so
I've become a little of both, a paradox.

314
00:35:51,373 --> 00:35:54,092
And it is hard to reconcile the extremes.

315
00:35:54,173 --> 00:35:57,563
Have a glass of champagne.
Does wonders for extremes.

316
00:35:57,653 --> 00:36:00,725
It's been known to launch
some lasting friendships.

317
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:08,525
- Don't you trust me?
- No.

318
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:11,081
- Are you afraid?
- No.

319
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:14,724
<i>Lechaim.</i>

320
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:27,329
I was three years old
when I rode my first elephant.

321
00:36:27,413 --> 00:36:31,964
I was six when I went on
my first... safrari.

322
00:36:34,093 --> 00:36:36,561
Frasari.

323
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,644
Wild-animal hunt.

324
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:41,691
And I was ten when
I bagged my first tiger.

325
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:45,569
But I'll never forget my lovely little pony.

326
00:36:45,653 --> 00:36:48,963
- When'd you bag him?
- Hm?

327
00:36:49,053 --> 00:36:53,012
You're making fun again!
You really don't like animals.

328
00:36:53,093 --> 00:36:56,244
Don't trust a man
who doesn't care about animals.

329
00:36:57,853 --> 00:37:02,449
And don't trust an animal
who doesn't care about people.

330
00:37:04,293 --> 00:37:07,012
Why you don't like people?

331
00:37:07,093 --> 00:37:10,688
- I like people.
- Oh.

332
00:37:10,773 --> 00:37:13,765
It's supposed to be me who doesn't.

333
00:37:13,853 --> 00:37:16,321
Like people. Right?

334
00:37:16,813 --> 00:37:18,849
If you say so.

335
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:21,652
I don't say so.

336
00:37:21,733 --> 00:37:24,531
- You say so. Right?
- I said so.

337
00:37:24,613 --> 00:37:27,844
And another thing you did -
you didn't tell me the truth.

338
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:32,330
- About what?
- About champagne. About this.

339
00:37:35,093 --> 00:37:37,368
Oh, boy, did you fib.

340
00:37:37,453 --> 00:37:43,289
You said... something about extremes.

341
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:45,523
It does wonders for them.

342
00:37:45,613 --> 00:37:49,242
It does more than that.
It makes your lips numb.

343
00:37:50,133 --> 00:37:53,523
I can't feel them. Are they still there?

344
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,684
Let's have a look.

345
00:38:01,653 --> 00:38:04,121
You didn't tell me about that part.

346
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:14,961
Won't do you any good. I can't feel it.

347
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:17,044
<i>(giggles)</i>

348
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:22,610
Hoisted on your own petard.

349
00:38:22,693 --> 00:38:27,323
Ooh. Don't try to say that
when you haven't got any lips.

350
00:38:33,173 --> 00:38:34,925
I'm plastered.

351
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:40,246
- If that's the right expression.
- Yes, that's the right expression.

352
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:46,522
You're a fraud and a liar. And you think
you are going to take advantage of me.

353
00:38:47,013 --> 00:38:51,052
- Oh, no. You think I am.
- I know you are.

354
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:54,443
That's the plan, isn't it?

355
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:59,766
Feed me champagne, break down
the inhibitions, and tally-ho!

356
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:09,164
No more Virgin Queen.

357
00:39:09,253 --> 00:39:11,847
Oh. We're all out of champagne.

358
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,925
- I'll get another bottle.
- Oh, no.

359
00:39:15,973 --> 00:39:22,242
I prefer to remain conscious, so I may
view the attempted seduction at first hand.

360
00:39:23,213 --> 00:39:26,842
Because you got
a surprise coming, Charlie.

361
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:29,970
I got friends in low places.

362
00:39:30,053 --> 00:39:33,329
You make one pass at me
and I'll set him on you.

363
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:38,487
<i>(whispers)</i> Understand? If he moves
a muscle... attack without mercy.

364
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:42,603
You see, Charlie?

365
00:39:42,693 --> 00:39:46,049
You're outnumbered, two against one.

366
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:49,125
And I don't care if you can juggle.

367
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:02,801
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

368
00:40:02,893 --> 00:40:05,532
Hm? Cat got your tongue?

369
00:40:06,653 --> 00:40:09,247
<i>(whispers)</i> Got his tongue?

370
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:14,646
My friend says he hasn't got it.
Then why don't you say something?

371
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:18,328
I couldn't think of anything to say.

372
00:40:18,413 --> 00:40:21,371
Why don't you kiss me again?

373
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:25,483
All right.

374
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:35,601
You know what, Charlie?
I could feel that one.

375
00:40:37,373 --> 00:40:39,170
Again.

376
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:52,770
If I were my father, I'd have you tortured.

377
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:58,132
You know, if you were your father, I doubt
very much if I would've kissed you.

378
00:41:00,053 --> 00:41:02,248
Good thinking, Charlie.

379
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:05,882
Then, now that we've
straightened out who I am,

380
00:41:05,973 --> 00:41:09,568
what are you going to do about it?

381
00:41:09,653 --> 00:41:11,644
<i>(Dala laughs)</i>

382
00:41:18,813 --> 00:41:23,603
What kind of a friend are you?
You were supposed to attack.

383
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:28,526
No friends, Charlie.
Now you got me outnumbered.

384
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:30,888
I thought we were friends.

385
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:34,924
You're the Juggler.
I'm the Virgin Queen.

386
00:41:35,013 --> 00:41:37,083
Somebody's got to win.

387
00:41:37,173 --> 00:41:40,131
Friends don't act like that.

388
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:43,444
Want to be friends, Charlie?
Or want to win?

389
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,446
Do you really want to know?

390
00:41:54,373 --> 00:41:56,170
No.

391
00:42:02,493 --> 00:42:04,723
Oh, Charlie!

392
00:42:06,533 --> 00:42:08,364
What's wrong?

393
00:42:08,453 --> 00:42:11,570
I don't feel... I think I'm going...

394
00:42:11,653 --> 00:42:13,644
Goodbye, Charlie.

395
00:42:20,733 --> 00:42:22,007
Dala.

396
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,170
Darling.

397
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,528
Dala?

398
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:31,808
Ma'am?

399
00:42:31,893 --> 00:42:33,884
Your Highness.

400
00:44:05,613 --> 00:44:07,604
Thank you. Up!

401
00:44:09,373 --> 00:44:11,364
There we are.

402
00:44:14,253 --> 00:44:16,164
Hello, Uncle Charles.

403
00:44:17,293 --> 00:44:18,442
George!

404
00:44:30,413 --> 00:44:34,167
Hello. Good morning.
Listen, what about this nephew?

405
00:44:34,253 --> 00:44:36,528
- How did you find out?
- I met him in the bar.

406
00:44:36,613 --> 00:44:39,605
- That's what I was trying to explain.
- What happened?

407
00:44:39,693 --> 00:44:43,163
- Jacques. He found me.
- I looked everywhere for you.

408
00:44:43,253 --> 00:44:46,643
I looked for you.
I nearly climbed in bed with your nephew.

409
00:44:46,733 --> 00:44:49,088
- You what?
- Don't worry, I took care of it.

410
00:44:49,173 --> 00:44:53,530
Phew! He had a heavy night.
I almost put the princess in bed with him.

411
00:44:53,613 --> 00:44:55,808
- Really?
- What you got there?

412
00:44:55,893 --> 00:45:01,126
A note. "Uncle Charles... Dear Uncle
Charles, don't worry about a thing."

413
00:45:01,213 --> 00:45:04,808
"I've gone to see the princess
to apologise for last night."

414
00:45:04,893 --> 00:45:06,645
Apologise for what?

415
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:10,282
That must have been embarrassing,
expecting one man and...

416
00:45:10,373 --> 00:45:15,401
She didn't expect anybody. She had
some champagne and had to rest awhile.

417
00:45:15,493 --> 00:45:18,087
- Of course.
- Think of him taking over my room!

418
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:21,131
- Didn't you know he was coming?
- No.

419
00:45:21,213 --> 00:45:24,603
- But who is he? What is he?
- He is my nephew, really.

420
00:45:24,693 --> 00:45:29,642
He's my late brother's son. I've been
responsible for him since he was ten.

421
00:45:29,733 --> 00:45:33,885
I sent him to all the best schools
in America. He did very well.

422
00:45:33,973 --> 00:45:36,567
He's just graduated from college. Look.

423
00:45:40,813 --> 00:45:44,203
- Isn't he a bit old for school?
- He did two years in the army.

424
00:45:44,293 --> 00:45:47,763
Then he lost another year
through some tropical disease.

425
00:45:47,853 --> 00:45:49,889
He's certainly attractive.

426
00:45:49,973 --> 00:45:53,090
A slight family resemblance.
But we have nothing in common.

427
00:45:53,173 --> 00:45:57,405
He's dedicated to education. He was top
of his class, cares nothing about sports,

428
00:45:57,493 --> 00:46:00,212
and in all his letters
he's never mentioned girls.

429
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:03,330
He may not have, but he's got
a good idea what they are.

430
00:46:03,413 --> 00:46:06,405
- I nearly didn't get out of here.
- You're joking!

431
00:46:06,493 --> 00:46:10,008
No. It was a relief to get back
to Jacques and his fiddle.

432
00:46:10,093 --> 00:46:12,448
If we don't do something,
he'll ruin everything.

433
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:14,649
You mean, if I don't do something.

434
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:17,930
He's just a young man
who's not been out in the world.

435
00:46:18,013 --> 00:46:21,005
Because he's been spending
all his time in the bedroom.

436
00:46:21,093 --> 00:46:23,732
- I'm surprised at you!
- I can handle it.

437
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:26,247
As a matter of fact,
it might be intriguing.

438
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:29,643
Particularly if the resemblance
goes deeper than you think.

439
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:34,090
- I'm envious.
- It seems that we're in the same spot.

440
00:46:34,173 --> 00:46:37,643
You envy George, and I envy the princess.

441
00:46:39,853 --> 00:46:45,291
I don't know what I'm going to do. I might
go back to college and get my doctorate.

442
00:46:45,373 --> 00:46:47,364
But I'm torn.

443
00:46:47,453 --> 00:46:52,243
There's so many things to be done, so
many countries where I might be useful.

444
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:54,847
I've even been considering
the Peace Corps.

445
00:46:54,933 --> 00:46:57,367
You're certainly not much like your uncle.

446
00:46:57,453 --> 00:47:01,162
I don't know much about him,
except what I've read in the newspapers.

447
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:03,528
- But one mustn't judge by that.
- No?

448
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:07,367
No. After all, whatever I am today,
he made it possible.

449
00:47:07,453 --> 00:47:10,126
Everyone has at least
one redeeming quality.

450
00:47:10,213 --> 00:47:12,010
Yes.

451
00:47:18,573 --> 00:47:23,203
Good morning, Your Highness. Hair of the
dog. May I present Madame Clouseau?

452
00:47:23,293 --> 00:47:26,524
- This is my nephew, George.
- We met at the bar last night.

453
00:47:26,613 --> 00:47:29,047
- How is your cough?
- It's completely gone.

454
00:47:29,133 --> 00:47:32,887
Ma'am, you should have some of this.
It'll put everything in perspective.

455
00:47:32,973 --> 00:47:36,966
My perspective is excellent this morning.
I see your leg is much better.

456
00:47:37,053 --> 00:47:39,328
It's a vast improvement, thank you.

457
00:47:39,413 --> 00:47:44,089
George and I had a family reunion, after
we carried you home. He's quite a lad.

458
00:47:44,173 --> 00:47:47,085
- So I've discovered.
- He may be joining the Peace Corps.

459
00:47:47,173 --> 00:47:51,007
Imagine, a Lytton in the Peace Corps.
You'll give the family a good name.

460
00:47:51,093 --> 00:47:52,572
- Please, sit down.
- No.

461
00:47:52,653 --> 00:47:56,407
I was on my way to ski
when I ran into Sir Charles. Do you ski?

462
00:47:56,493 --> 00:47:59,963
Ski? No, not very well.

463
00:48:00,053 --> 00:48:03,489
You should learn. If it wasn't for this leg,
I'd take you in hand.

464
00:48:03,573 --> 00:48:07,725
I'm hardly in your uncle's class, but
I'd be happy to give you my experience.

465
00:48:07,813 --> 00:48:11,886
I'm sure Madame is an excellent teacher.
She can get you started out right.

466
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:16,125
- If it wouldn't be too much trouble, yeah.
- Not at all. It would be a pleasure.

467
00:48:16,213 --> 00:48:18,807
Perhaps you'd like to come along now?

468
00:48:18,893 --> 00:48:23,284
- You can't pass up an invitation like that.
- I haven't got the clothes or any skis.

469
00:48:23,373 --> 00:48:26,445
The shop'll fix you up.
Just charge everything to me.

470
00:48:26,533 --> 00:48:29,684
Thanks. Your Highness,
I hope to see you again.

471
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:33,527
If you're back early.
I'm leaving on the afternoon train.

472
00:48:33,613 --> 00:48:35,410
- Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.

473
00:48:35,493 --> 00:48:38,212
- Thanks, Uncle Charles.
- Have fun.

474
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:40,727
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

475
00:48:40,813 --> 00:48:43,122
Mind the instructor,
she knows what she's doing.

476
00:48:43,213 --> 00:48:46,922
- Not staying?
- No, we're off to the slopes.

477
00:48:47,013 --> 00:48:49,481
- So long, Uncle Charles.
- Have fun.

478
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:53,893
Just in time. You sure you won't join me?

479
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,964
Quite sure.

480
00:48:59,133 --> 00:49:02,250
- Do you have to leave this afternoon?
- Yes.

481
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:06,485
- Isn't this departure rather sudden?
- Not at all. Why do you think so?

482
00:49:06,573 --> 00:49:08,882
I just thought that after last night...

483
00:49:08,973 --> 00:49:11,612
My leaving has nothing
to do with last night.

484
00:49:11,693 --> 00:49:14,526
- Hasn't it?
- You don't know me very well.

485
00:49:14,613 --> 00:49:16,888
No, but I thought I was making progress.

486
00:49:16,973 --> 00:49:19,441
That was champagne, nothing more.

487
00:49:19,533 --> 00:49:23,412
- Whatever it was, it was very interesting.
- I don't remember.

488
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:27,281
- That's such an awful old cliché.
- It's true.

489
00:49:27,373 --> 00:49:30,968
Women have half a glass too much
and let down the barriers a little,

490
00:49:31,053 --> 00:49:35,922
then wake up guilty and try to reclaim
their virtue by saying "I don't remember."

491
00:49:36,013 --> 00:49:39,688
- Are you saying my virtue is not intact?
- You know it is.

492
00:49:39,773 --> 00:49:43,322
- Then why should I feel guilty?
- You're not worried about what happened,

493
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:45,563
but about what might have happened.

494
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:48,247
That makes you vulnerable.
That makes you a woman.

495
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:50,801
You're an arrogant fool.

496
00:49:51,853 --> 00:49:57,610
Perhaps I am. But after what I just said, a
real woman would have slapped my face.

497
00:50:06,813 --> 00:50:10,852
- I'm glad that's over. Friends again?
- Friends.

498
00:50:10,933 --> 00:50:14,050
Good. The least you can do is
let me take you to the station.

499
00:50:14,133 --> 00:50:15,202
All right.

500
00:50:15,293 --> 00:50:17,124
- You really have to go?
- Yes.

501
00:50:17,213 --> 00:50:19,886
That's too bad.
Nothing I can say to make you stay?

502
00:50:19,973 --> 00:50:22,282
- Nothing.
- What time do you have to be there?

503
00:50:22,373 --> 00:50:25,490
- Three o'clock.
- Three o'clock, on the dot, I'll be here.

504
00:50:25,573 --> 00:50:27,564
Your Highness.

505
00:50:29,653 --> 00:50:31,644
Three o'clock.

506
00:50:40,453 --> 00:50:42,683
Do we have to start
the lessons right away?

507
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:44,809
That's what we're up here for.

508
00:50:44,893 --> 00:50:48,408
I was hoping we could
talk about last night.

509
00:50:48,493 --> 00:50:50,688
We can talk about that later.

510
00:50:50,773 --> 00:50:53,924
- You were more fun in bed.
- Will you do me a favour, Mr Lytton?

511
00:50:54,013 --> 00:50:56,766
- If you call me George.
- Forget about last night.

512
00:50:56,853 --> 00:51:00,892
I was impetuous. I had too much to drink.
I'd just had a fight with my husband.

513
00:51:00,973 --> 00:51:04,488
That might make it easier for you
to forget, but I didn't sleep a wink.

514
00:51:04,573 --> 00:51:06,768
It was a very frustrating experience.

515
00:51:06,853 --> 00:51:09,606
That's your problem.
But I wouldn't make any plans.

516
00:51:09,693 --> 00:51:14,403
I never make any plans. I just sort of...
follow my instincts, you know?

517
00:51:14,493 --> 00:51:19,089
George... it's four miles down the
mountain and I'm a very good skier.

518
00:51:19,173 --> 00:51:22,688
Follow your instincts too closely
and you'll break your neck.

519
00:51:22,773 --> 00:51:26,049
The first things to learn
about skiing are the fundamentals.

520
00:51:26,133 --> 00:51:28,601
Let's see you turn around.

521
00:51:30,973 --> 00:51:34,283
It's not as easy as it looks.
Let me give you a hand.

522
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:38,052
- Let's try something easier.
- Now, George!

523
00:51:38,133 --> 00:51:41,443
- It's a lot easier.
- You were going to watch those instincts!

524
00:51:41,533 --> 00:51:44,491
- I'm busy. You watch 'em.
- You're abominable!

525
00:51:44,573 --> 00:51:46,689
That's me, the abominable snowman.

526
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:49,241
Now, George, stop it!

527
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:51,722
Oh, George!

528
00:51:52,933 --> 00:51:54,924
<i>Imbécile!</i>

529
00:52:10,773 --> 00:52:14,083
Perhaps we'll meet again.
Goodbye, Sir Charles.

530
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:16,323
Just a minute.

531
00:52:16,413 --> 00:52:18,802
- That's him. There he goes.
- Who?

532
00:52:18,893 --> 00:52:22,772
The man who stole your dog.
In that little car.

533
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:26,561
Hup!

534
00:52:32,853 --> 00:52:34,605
Hah-hup!

535
00:52:41,613 --> 00:52:44,411
Hah-hup! Wah-hup!

536
00:53:06,373 --> 00:53:08,170
Whoa.

537
00:53:10,173 --> 00:53:11,811
- How's it going?
- I'll miss her.

538
00:53:11,893 --> 00:53:14,248
Never get too involved with your victims.

539
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:18,326
- Shall we get out in the open?
- No, it's a bit hard here. Come on.

540
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,729
That's good. That's OK.

541
00:53:21,813 --> 00:53:24,088
All right. Start. Give it to me now.

542
00:53:24,173 --> 00:53:26,926
Now my turn.

543
00:53:31,453 --> 00:53:33,444
- How close are they?
- Now!

544
00:53:33,533 --> 00:53:35,330
Ready?

545
00:53:38,853 --> 00:53:41,845
Come on, little doggy. Here we are.

546
00:53:44,973 --> 00:53:46,929
Look out!

547
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:59,128
She's got the dog. I will see you later.

548

585
00:57:23,493 --> 00:57:27,406
- You have a wonderful smile.
- I have a great deal to smile about.

586
00:57:27,493 --> 00:57:30,087
I have Amber back,
and I'm having a wonderful time.

587
00:57:30,173 --> 00:57:34,325
- You missed your train.
- There is one at midnight and tomorrow.

588
00:57:34,413 --> 00:57:38,770
Perhaps I should arrange to have your dog
kidnapped again. You'd be bound to stay.

589
00:57:38,853 --> 00:57:41,890
Did you arrange to have
her kidnapped the first time?

590
00:57:41,973 --> 00:57:44,009
Of course.

591
00:57:48,013 --> 00:57:51,801
Well, I am willing to bet you 10,000 francs

592
00:57:51,893 --> 00:57:56,409
that the Phantom is in Cortina at this very
moment. Even, perhaps, in this room.

593
00:57:56,493 --> 00:57:59,087
How exciting!
What do you think, Mr Tucker?

594
00:57:59,173 --> 00:58:03,928
I agree. Ten of his last 15 victims have
been guests at Angela Dunning's parties.

595
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:06,652
What are we all talking about?

596
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:10,169
- The notorious Phantom.
- I'm afraid I've never heard of him.

597
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:12,562
He seems to be quite a fellow.

598
00:58:12,653 --> 00:58:15,929
There are few thieves
who are as clever as the Phantom.

599
00:58:16,013 --> 00:58:20,564
Each theft is completely different
and unique, classic in its conception.

600
00:58:20,653 --> 00:58:23,725
I thought your theory is
that he does repeat himself.

601
00:58:23,813 --> 00:58:26,964
Only as far as Angela Dunning's
parties are concerned.

602
00:58:27,053 --> 00:58:31,490
However, there is one other duplication.
But that is his... trademark,

603
00:58:31,573 --> 00:58:34,133
his calling card, so to speak.

604
00:58:34,213 --> 00:58:37,125
He always leaves
a white monogrammed glove.

605
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:38,771
Sounds theatrical.

606
00:58:38,853 --> 00:58:43,005
Your Highness, if I were the Phantom,
I'd have chosen my victim already.

607
00:58:43,093 --> 00:58:45,288
Really? And who would that be?

608
00:58:45,373 --> 00:58:48,206
Who owns the most fabulous
diamond in the world?

609
00:58:48,293 --> 00:58:51,091
- I suppose I do.
- Exactly. The Pink Panther.

610
00:58:51,173 --> 00:58:53,767
Such a prize, he could never resist.

611
00:58:53,853 --> 00:58:57,323
He'd be disappointed.
The Pink Panther is in my safe at...

612
00:58:57,413 --> 00:59:00,007
Your Highness, please.
Don't say it, not here.

613
00:59:00,093 --> 00:59:05,326
Your Highness, I read there was a dispute
over the ownership of the Pink Panther.

614
00:59:05,413 --> 00:59:08,689
It belongs to me.
It was a gift from my late father.

615
00:59:08,773 --> 00:59:11,241
- I shall never surrender it.
- Why should you?

616
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:16,123
When the government seized power, they
claimed it was the property of the people.

617
00:59:16,213 --> 00:59:19,683
There's talk of the international court
deciding the issue.

618
00:59:19,773 --> 00:59:24,893
Why don't I steal the diamond,
and you and I can split the insurance?

619
00:59:24,973 --> 00:59:26,725
All right.

620
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,168
I feel like dancing. Your Highness?

621
00:59:29,253 --> 00:59:31,244
I'd love to.

622
00:59:32,533 --> 00:59:35,889
- How about you, madame?
- Yes, of course.

623
00:59:35,973 --> 00:59:38,726
- Your leg is better, Sir Charles?
- What?

624
00:59:38,813 --> 00:59:42,601
- I say, your leg is better.
- Yes. Much better, thank you.

625
00:59:43,973 --> 00:59:46,612
You know, Mr Tucker... Argh!

626
00:59:49,173 --> 00:59:52,927
- That's my beer, old man.
- My hand, I burnt it. I'm sorry.

627
00:59:56,413 --> 00:59:58,404
Sit down.

628
01:00:01,653 --> 01:00:06,283
- It is working out better than we expected.
- We've only found out that it's not here.

629
01:00:06,373 --> 01:00:08,933
You'll have no trouble
discovering where it is.

630
01:00:09,013 --> 01:00:12,688
Her Highness seems
to be completely captivated.

631
01:00:12,773 --> 01:00:14,923
I'd say that's an exaggeration.

632
01:00:15,013 --> 01:00:18,608
You're either showing a touch of senility
or you need glasses.

633
01:00:18,693 --> 01:00:22,652
When I'm showing my senility, you'll
be playing with your grandchildren.

634
01:00:22,733 --> 01:00:27,170
- One has to have children first.
- You wouldn't dare.

635
01:00:27,253 --> 01:00:31,041
Jacques would make a wonderful father.
He has many redeeming qualities.

636
01:00:31,133 --> 01:00:35,411
- Name one.
- He's kind, loyal, faithful, obedient.

637
01:00:35,493 --> 01:00:39,486
- You married a boy scout or a dachshund.
- And he adores me.

638
01:00:39,573 --> 01:00:42,531
That eliminates the boy scouts.

639
01:00:42,613 --> 01:00:44,808
- Good night.
- Thank you.

640
01:00:51,813 --> 01:00:53,929
- Ah.
- You seem to have lost something.

641
01:00:54,013 --> 01:00:56,811
- Yes.
- How'd you like to borrow mine?

642
01:00:56,893 --> 01:00:59,361
- Thanks, Uncle Charles. Yes.
- Madame.

643
01:01:06,813 --> 01:01:10,010
- You've been avoiding me.
- That about describes it.

644
01:01:10,093 --> 01:01:13,529
- Know what I've been thinking?
- Yes. That's why I've avoided you.

645
01:01:13,613 --> 01:01:17,162
I don't think you were really looking
for me in my uncle's bedroom.

646
01:01:17,253 --> 01:01:19,244
- Don't be ridiculous!
- I mean it.

647
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:22,131
Not the way you treated me today.
Know what I think?

648
01:01:22,213 --> 01:01:25,205
- What?
- Well, I...

649
01:01:25,293 --> 01:01:29,002
- Oh, yeah.
- What do you think, George?

650
01:01:29,093 --> 01:01:32,563
- I think maybe I was wrong.
- Mm-hm.

Hello? Oh! Inspector Clouseau.

661
01:02:39,293 --> 01:02:44,162
Clouseau? This is the prefect of police.
I have information regarding the Phantom.

662
01:02:44,253 --> 01:02:47,768
- The Phantom?
- <i>You must come at once. I'm in Brunico.</i>

663

Brunico? But that's in Brunico.
I mean, that's 30 miles from here.

664
01:02:51,773 --> 01:02:55,083
It is here that I discovered the information.
Come immediately.

665
01:02:55,173 --> 01:02:58,210
I cannot say more, I am being watched.

666
01:02:58,293 --> 01:03:00,523
Yes. I understand. Yes.

667
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:07,852
I'm sorry. Important police business. I will
be back with you as soon as possible.

668
01:03:07,933 --> 01:03:10,572
I understand, my love.

01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:13,008
- Darling?
- Yes?

670
01:03:13,093 --> 01:03:16,722
I am a husband that must be
envied by all other husbands.

671
01:03:16,813 --> 01:03:19,566
I'm sure no one ever had
a husband like you.

672
01:03:19,653 --> 01:03:21,769
My darling.

673
01:03:24,733 --> 01:03:27,008
My darling, don't move, don't panic.

674
01:03:27,093 --> 01:03:32,690
All that has happened is that my hat has
caught in one of your naughty hairpins.

Voilà.

Another call about the Phantom.

679
01:04:24,533 --> 01:04:29,846
There's something going on. I don't quite
know what, but there's something wrong.

680
01:04:29,933 --> 01:04:33,130
- Do you want to call it off?
- I'm considering it.

681
01:04:33,213 --> 01:04:35,886
- Have you considered something else?
- What?

682
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:39,727
- That you're growing a conscience.
- A conscience? About what?

683
01:04:39,813 --> 01:04:43,044
- The princess.
- You're being ridiculous.

684
01:04:43,133 --> 01:04:47,843
No. I'm just being a woman. This time
you've chosen a fascinating victim.

685
01:04:47,933 --> 01:04:51,892
You've broken the first rule
and allowed yourself to become involved.

686
01:04:51,973 --> 01:04:54,123
You're being a woman, all right.

687
01:04:54,213 --> 01:04:57,523
That's obvious. Competition
always makes a woman obvious.

- I don't know. But not tonight.

Out chasing the Phantom.

want me to go to Brunico?

Don't worry about this mess.
We can have it cleaned up later.

But did you not bathe earlier?

Yes, I did. But it would warm me up,

01:10:43,213 --> 01:10:45,204
Thank you very much.

757
01:10:47,653 --> 01:10:50,690
Oh, darling. <i>(mumbles)</i>

758
01:10:50,773 --> 01:10:53,003
- I beg your pardon?
- I said... <i>(mumbles)</i>

759
01:10:53,093 --> 01:10:55,084
Yes, I did.

760
01:10:59,453 --> 01:11:01,091
Hey, come...

761
01:11:01,973 --> 01:11:03,964
Come out, quick!

762
01:11:07,333 --> 01:11:09,324
<i>(knock at door)</i>

763
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,369
- Who is it?
- Bellboy.

764
01:11:13,453 --> 01:11:15,444
One minute.

765
01:11:17,173 --> 01:11:19,846
- Yes?
- The inspector's violin.

766
01:11:19,933 --> 01:11:23,084
- Madame, the flowers.
- It's nothing. It doesn't matter.

767
01:11:23,173 --> 01:11:27,963
If they found out downstairs,
I'd lose my job. I'll ring for the maid.

768
01:11:29,773 --> 01:11:31,764
<i>(shower running)</i>

769
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:42,006
Darling? How would you
like to wash my back?

770
01:11:42,093 --> 01:11:47,292
I'd love to, but, you see, I have to...
I mean, I have... I'm cold.

771
01:11:47,373 --> 01:11:49,967
- Oh.
- Yes.

772
01:11:53,693 --> 01:11:56,082
- Get the broom.
- But...

773
01:12:00,133 --> 01:12:02,010
Come on!

774
01:12:02,093 --> 01:12:04,084
Hurry up. Go.

775
01:12:11,973 --> 01:12:13,611
<i>(knock at door)</i>

776
01:12:16,253 --> 01:12:18,926
Shan't be a moment.
I'll just put on my pyjamas.

777
01:12:19,013 --> 01:12:22,005
Darling, I think I've got
something in my right eye.

778
01:12:22,093 --> 01:12:25,369
- Let me...
- I mean the left. No, this one.

779
01:12:25,453 --> 01:12:27,011
Darling, it hurts!

780
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:32,247
Well, then, stand still for a moment.
I can't see. Stand in the light a moment.

781
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:34,563
- Where?
- Right here. Here.

782
01:12:34,653 --> 01:12:37,326
- There's nothing in your eye.
- Nothing?

783
01:12:37,533 --> 01:12:40,525
Only your eye. That's all that is there.

784
01:12:50,013 --> 01:12:52,243
What are you doing?

785
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:57,327
Put it back in. There's no time. He's gonna
come back! Get under the bed. Quick.

786
01:13:02,093 --> 01:13:05,290
Aha. Why aren't you in bed, my darling?

787
01:13:05,933 --> 01:13:09,369
Uh... I was. I mean, I was just go...

788
01:13:09,453 --> 01:13:11,842
Oops. I'm just going, dear.

789
01:13:13,693 --> 01:13:16,082
Ooh! I'm cold.

790
01:13:16,173 --> 01:13:20,212
- My Stradivarius.
- The porter just brought it in.

791
01:13:21,053 --> 01:13:25,524
Ah! I sent it to the village to be repaired.
I just hope they know how to fix plastic.

792
01:13:25,613 --> 01:13:27,922
I hope so, too.

793
01:13:28,493 --> 01:13:31,087
So far so good.

794
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:33,368
We shall see.

795
01:13:33,453 --> 01:13:36,013
<i>(tuneless scraping)</i>

796
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,802
Better than ever.

797
01:13:39,893 --> 01:13:42,646
You know, I doubt
if we shall need it tonight.

798
01:13:42,733 --> 01:13:45,770
I'm sure we won't, darling.

799
01:14:02,133 --> 01:14:04,169
What is it?

800
01:14:04,253 --> 01:14:06,244
Very strange.

801
01:14:17,093 --> 01:14:20,324
Jacques, why don't you come to bed?

802
01:14:21,693 --> 01:14:25,129
You know, I don't understand this.

803
01:14:25,213 --> 01:14:27,602
You see...

804
01:14:27,693 --> 01:14:30,571
these, uh, footprints...

805
01:14:31,613 --> 01:14:36,368
they were...
they were made by sh-shoes...

806
01:14:36,453 --> 01:14:40,731
and they were not made by... my feet...

807
01:14:40,813 --> 01:14:42,724
Oh! Ow!

808
01:14:47,333 --> 01:14:49,324
The light.

809
01:14:54,773 --> 01:14:57,765
<i>(Clouseau)</i> At last! Darling, my little...

810
01:15:01,213 --> 01:15:03,522
<i>(Simone)</i> Darling? What's the matter?

811
01:15:03,613 --> 01:15:07,401
It's very strange, my love,
but suddenly I'm freezing cold.

812
01:15:07,493 --> 01:15:09,609
You are freezing cold?

813
01:15:09,693 --> 01:15:12,048
- The window is open.
- The window is open.

814
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:15,091
Sometimes it's healthy
to have a little fresh air.

815
01:15:15,173 --> 01:15:18,927
Healthy is one thing,
but it's hell in here, my love.

816
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:22,042
Ten below zero outside, my darling.

817
01:15:34,493 --> 01:15:37,053
Ah, my darling. My darling.

818
01:15:40,733 --> 01:15:42,485
<i>(Clouseau)</i> At last!

<i>(Clouseau screams)</i>

821
01:15:48,893 --> 01:15:51,282
What are you doing?

822
01:16:05,333 --> 01:16:08,723
- Yes?
- I just arrived. No trouble with the police.

823
01:16:08,813 --> 01:16:12,010
But the princess is expecting
some visitors tomorrow.

824
01:16:12,093 --> 01:16:15,722
- <i>Did she say anything about leaving?</i>
- Who is this?

825
01:16:27,893 --> 01:16:30,248
- <i>(woman) Yes?</i>
- Princess Dala, please.

826
01:16:30,333 --> 01:16:34,326
<i>Her Highness checked out</i>
<i>a short while ago.</i>

827

<i>(tapping from suitcase)</i>

828
01:17:41,613 --> 01:17:43,569
<i>(whistles)</i>

829
01:17:43,653 --> 01:17:45,450
Uncle Charles!

830
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:17,082
Uh-oh. Oh! Ah!

831
01:18:20,013 --> 01:18:22,368
<i>(laughter)</i>

832
01:18:22,453 --> 01:18:27,447
I said he could come as a Borgia, and then
he wouldn't have to explain his cousin.

833
01:18:31,213 --> 01:18:33,204
Good evening.

834
01:18:34,813 --> 01:18:36,804
<i>(whistles cheerfully)</i>

835
01:18:41,013 --> 01:18:46,041
I mean, I enjoy champagne in bed
as much as the next man, my angel,

836
01:18:46,133 --> 01:18:50,172
but, from now on, perhaps
a more practical approach?

837
01:18:50,253 --> 01:18:54,371
I'm sorry, my darling. I just wanted
to surprise you, that's all.

838
01:18:54,453 --> 01:18:58,241
- It's been a night of surprises.
- You can say that again.

839
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:01,530
It's been... <i>(chuckles)</i>

840

- Anyway, anyway, my love...
- Yes?

841
01:19:05,573 --> 01:19:08,246
<i>(phone rings)</i>

842
01:19:08,333 --> 01:19:11,086
Shall I say you're not here?

843
01:19:11,173 --> 01:19:14,165
No. It's all right, darling. I'll answer it.

844
01:19:22,253 --> 01:19:25,051
- Yes?
- Tucker here, Inspector.

845
01:19:25,133 --> 01:19:28,205
The man who kidnapped the dog
was driving a rented car.

846
01:19:28,293 --> 01:19:30,853
He's been identified
as a man named Artoff.

847
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:36,644
London says that a man of his description
is employed by Sir Charles Lytton.

848
01:19:36,733 --> 01:19:39,611
I see. Come up immediately. Sir Charles!

849
01:19:39,693 --> 01:19:43,732
- Sir Charles?
- The Phantom. I've got him this time.

850
01:19:44,933 --> 01:19:46,730
Oh.

851
01:19:49,093 --> 01:19:50,890
<i>(gunshot)</i>

852
01:19:56,933 --> 01:19:59,891
Sir Charles, open that door.

853
01:19:59,973 --> 01:20:04,285
I know you're in there, Sir Charles.
Open up. This is the police.

854
01:20:04,373 --> 01:20:07,365
- Stand back while I fire.
- Don't do that, old man.

855
01:20:20,693 --> 01:20:23,048
- Jacques knows.
- Somebody else.

856
01:20:23,133 --> 01:20:28,412
George has got my do-it-yourself
Phantom kit. I've gotta get out of here.

857
01:20:28,493 --> 01:20:31,724
- His clothes are still here.
- Perhaps he's already escaped.

858
01:20:31,813 --> 01:20:34,532
Unlikely. He doesn't realise
that I am on to him.

859
01:20:34,613 --> 01:20:39,482
Now listen. We've no proof that Artoff was
actually the man driving the Innocenti.

860
01:20:39,573 --> 01:20:42,645
Sir Charles is our man.
My every instinct tells me so.

861
01:20:42,733 --> 01:20:44,644
Careful. This gun is loaded.

862
01:20:44,733 --> 01:20:49,045
What I must do now is get dressed
and search the rest of the hotel.

863
01:20:55,493 --> 01:20:59,486
- Did you find him?
- No. But he can't be far. I must dress...

864
01:21:03,733 --> 01:21:05,291
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

865
01:21:05,373 --> 01:21:09,366
My coat. My <i>Sûreté</i> Scotland-Yard-type
mackintosh, it's gone.

866
01:21:09,453 --> 01:21:11,842
Good evening, Inspector.

867
01:21:47,893 --> 01:21:51,363
- <i>(Dala)</i> What is it, Saloud?
- Inspector Clouseau.

868
01:21:54,013 --> 01:21:57,926
Please excuse this interruption.
I have news of great importance.

869
01:21:58,013 --> 01:22:03,485
This is Mr Tucker of Lloyd's of London,
and we have met before.

870
01:22:03,573 --> 01:22:07,009
- I've met her, too.
- I know, but we are meeting her again.

871
01:22:07,093 --> 01:22:09,004
What is this news?

872
01:22:09,093 --> 01:22:12,165
I have discovered
the identity of the Phantom.

873
01:22:12,253 --> 01:22:14,130
- You don't say.
- I do say.

874
01:22:14,213 --> 01:22:18,126
- Of course, you're not positive.
- I am. He is, I believe, here in Rome.

875
01:22:18,213 --> 01:22:20,124
- Really?
- Yes.

876
01:22:20,213 --> 01:22:22,443
Have you heard from Sir Charles Lytton?

877
01:22:22,533 --> 01:22:25,047
Not since I left Cortina. Why?

878
01:22:25,133 --> 01:22:27,772
Sir Charles and the Phantom
are one and the same.

879
01:22:27,853 --> 01:22:30,606
- You're not serious.
- I am serious.

880
01:22:30,693 --> 01:22:34,686
I can understand how difficult it is
for Your Highness to accept the facts.

881
01:22:34,773 --> 01:22:37,924
Sir Charles is a very persuasive
and attractive man.

882
01:22:38,013 --> 01:22:42,245
He is also Sir Charles Lytton, a man
of considerable influence and reputation.

883
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:46,724
- She's got quite a point there.
- He is a fraud, and I shall prove it.

884
01:22:46,813 --> 01:22:50,328
Meanwhile, I would like to surround
the house with armed guards.

885
01:22:50,413 --> 01:22:52,210
I take it the gem is in the villa?

886
01:22:52,293 --> 01:22:55,888
It is. But as you know,
I'm having a large party this evening.

887
01:22:55,973 --> 01:22:59,363
I assure you, your guests
will be caused no embarrassment.

888
01:22:59,453 --> 01:23:03,048
They will not be aware my men
are present in their disguises.

889
01:23:03,133 --> 01:23:06,205
In that case, you have my permission.

890
01:23:17,893 --> 01:23:20,771
Your Highness, mark my words,

891
01:23:20,853 --> 01:23:25,005
if Sir Charles is foolish enough
to attempt to steal your diamond tonight,

892
01:23:25,093 --> 01:23:29,086
you will be witness to the capture
of the notorious Phantom.

893
01:23:30,853 --> 01:23:32,844
<i>(Dala)</i> Gentlemen.

894
01:23:48,613 --> 01:23:51,411
- The plans will have to be changed.
- No.

895
01:23:52,253 --> 01:23:56,246
We just have to make sure that
Sir Charles doesn't steal the jewel.

<i>(dance music)</i>

Hello.

898
01:24:45,973 --> 01:24:47,691
- Hello, Tucker.
- Like a drink?

899
01:24:47,773 --> 01:24:51,402
No. I never drink whilst I'm on duty.
You should know that. Never.

900
01:24:51,493 --> 01:24:55,088
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Warm.

901
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:57,403
Yes. It must be hell in there.

902
01:24:57,493 --> 01:25:00,291
Bet it's not so good in there.

903
01:25:00,373 --> 01:25:04,525
- Anything suspicious?
- No, no, no. Nothing to worry about.

904
01:25:04,613 --> 01:25:09,607
My men are everywhere - mingling here,
mingling there, watching all the time.

905
01:25:14,773 --> 01:25:17,731
How dare you drink whilst you're on duty?
Who is inside there?

906
01:25:17,813 --> 01:25:19,769
- Sergeant Walter.
- Sergeant Coff.

907
01:25:19,853 --> 01:25:25,325
Any more behaviour like this and I'll have
your stripes! Get out and start mingling.

908
01:25:28,493 --> 01:25:33,613
- Funny that, the zebra and the stripes.
- What? Oh, yes. Very good, very good.

909
01:25:33,693 --> 01:25:36,685
Not bad, not bad. I think I'll mingle.

910
01:25:37,733 --> 01:25:39,530
Goodbye.

911
01:25:54,653 --> 01:25:58,009
Didn't I say I'd make this
the biggest social success of the year?

912
01:25:58,093 --> 01:25:59,321
Yes.

913
01:25:59,413 --> 01:26:02,928
The only thing that worries me is,
what do we do for your next one?

914
01:26:03,013 --> 01:26:07,404
- How can I possibly top this?
- You'll think of something. Excuse me.

915
01:26:07,493 --> 01:26:11,042
Of course, love. Have a ball. Hello, you!

916
01:26:14,573 --> 01:26:17,610
May I see your invitation, please?

917
01:26:17,693 --> 01:26:19,490
All right.

918
01:26:25,653 --> 01:26:30,169
- Wasn't there a gorilla in a Rolls Royce?
- Yes. Probably a rich uncle.

919
01:26:31,733 --> 01:26:34,293
You see, gentlemen? Perfectly safe.

920
01:26:34,373 --> 01:26:38,446
One cannot be too careful. This party,
all your guests wearing masks -

921
01:26:38,533 --> 01:26:41,730
it was possible that the Phantom
had already done his work.

922
01:26:41,813 --> 01:26:45,488
Without an invitation, how could
Sir Charles get past your guards?

923
01:26:45,573 --> 01:26:48,565
Where the Phantom is concerned,
Your Highness...

924
01:26:50,173 --> 01:26:52,641

- Sshh.

- What are you doing?

01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:08,404
- I protest.
- Remove your head at once.

927
01:27:08,493 --> 01:27:10,961
Tucker, remove his head.

928
01:27:13,493 --> 01:27:14,812
Ah!

929
01:27:14,893 --> 01:27:17,646
- Good grief. It's our ambassador.
- Ambassador?

930
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:21,965
My apologies, Lord Cravenwood. He was
only acting with the best of motives.

931
01:27:22,053 --> 01:27:24,044
Your Highness.

932

- In the flesh.
- What are you doing?

936
01:27:42,613 --> 01:27:46,811
- Tarzan let me use the car tonight.
- Listen, you've got to get out of here.

I discovered you, naturally I thought...

You haven't danced with me all evening.

Pardon me.

946

I'm lost. I must have gotten off the road,
the main road. I'm on my way to Frascati.

947
01:28:23,253 --> 01:28:26,802
You'll have to go down the road
a half-mile. You'll see a sign.

948
01:28:26,893 --> 01:28:30,886
Turn right, it'll take you
right to the highway.

949
01:28:48,493 --> 01:28:51,690
Excuse me. I've got
to talk to Lord Cravenwood.

950
01:28:51,773 --> 01:28:55,083
- That's OK. He's making me itch anyway.

Thank you so much, sir.
Having a good time?

01:29:06,373 --> 01:29:08,728
- Yes, an extremely good time.

You know what I did?
I took a plush Hollywood apartment.

Surrounded myself with all of
the advantages of a wealthy bachelor.

And sent you glowing reports
of a brilliant academic career.

A certain amount of dishonesty is bound

Won't you sit down?

1052
01:42:10,453 --> 01:42:13,843
I'll be brief. My husband feels
he has enough evidence

1053
01:42:13,933 --> 01:42:17,972
to prove that Sir Charles is the Phantom
and to convict George as his accomplice.

1054
01:42:18,053 --> 01:42:20,772
As I see it, they only have one chance.

What is that?

1056
01:42:22,813 --> 01:42:25,725
If Your Highness were
to testify on their behalf,

1057
01:42:25,813 --> 01:42:29,726
somehow convince the jury that
they didn't even take the diamond.

1058
01:42:29,813 --> 01:42:32,611
- You surprise me, madame.
- I expect to.

1059
01:42:32,693 --> 01:42:36,811
And I'm taking the chance that you will
keep what I say in strict confidence.

1060
01:42:36,893 --> 01:42:41,125
- I think I can guess.
- It's not too difficult.

1061
01:42:41,213 --> 01:42:46,207
Being the wife of Inspector Clouseau, you
could have been very helpful to Charles.

1062
01:42:47,373 --> 01:42:49,250
I have been.

1063
01:42:49,333 --> 01:42:52,052
Was stealing my dog all part of the plan?

1064
01:42:52,133 --> 01:42:55,170
That <i>was</i> the plan.

1065
01:42:55,253 --> 01:42:59,724
But I think you should know
that Charles wanted to call it off.

1066
01:43:22,573 --> 01:43:27,363
You've had it all the time. You stole it
before the international court decided.

1067
01:43:27,453 --> 01:43:31,651
I'd gladly sacrifice it to save Charles.
But it's not so simple.

1068
01:43:31,733 --> 01:43:34,805
Couldn't you say you just
found it on the grounds?

1069
01:43:34,893 --> 01:43:37,532
They'd claim he dropped it
making his escape.

1070
01:43:37,613 --> 01:43:41,128
No. To save Charles, we must prove
that someone else stole it.

1071
01:43:41,213 --> 01:43:44,364
But we'd never be able to do that.

1072
01:43:44,453 --> 01:43:46,444
I have an idea.

1073
01:43:48,813 --> 01:43:51,088
<i>(man)</i> The trial is in its third day.

1074
01:43:51,173 --> 01:43:55,883
Seldom in the history of Italian law
has a trial created such excitement.

1075
01:43:55,973 --> 01:43:58,965
Thousands of people -
most of them women -

1076
01:43:59,053 --> 01:44:02,489
have gathered daily,
hoping to glimpse Sir Charles Lytton,

1077
01:44:02,573 --> 01:44:05,292
the man accused of being
the notorious Phantom.

1078
01:44:05,373 --> 01:44:10,652
The court adjourned yesterday,
as the defence investigated new evidence.

1079
01:44:10,733 --> 01:44:13,531
It is rumoured that when
the court convenes today,

1080
01:44:13,613 --> 01:44:16,252
the defence will call a surprise witness.

1081
01:44:16,333 --> 01:44:18,972
The defence has only one witness,
Mr President.

1082
01:44:19,053 --> 01:44:23,604
Would you please call Inspector
Jacques Clouseau to the stand?

1083
01:44:23,693 --> 01:44:27,242
- Me, a defence witness?
- Inspector Clouseau.

1084
01:44:27,333 --> 01:44:31,326
Nothing to worry about, my darling.
You'll make fools out of them.

1085
01:44:40,773 --> 01:44:42,331
Inspector Clouseau,

1086
01:44:42,413 --> 01:44:47,248
you have testified under oath to certain
pertinent facts concerning this case.

1087
01:44:47,333 --> 01:44:50,211
Your testimony alone
has been the major factor

1088
01:44:50,293 --> 01:44:52,966
in casting suspicion on the defendant.

1089
01:44:53,053 --> 01:44:58,047
Aside from the Phantom himself, you are
the foremost authority on the Phantom.

1090
01:44:59,053 --> 01:45:01,965
I have made the Phantom my life's work.

1091
01:45:02,053 --> 01:45:05,045
You have testified that
the Phantom has been a guest

1092
01:45:05,133 --> 01:45:07,772
at the parties given by
Miss Angela Dunning.

1093
01:45:07,853 --> 01:45:08,888
Yes.

1094
01:45:08,973 --> 01:45:13,364
You have testified that it was either
during or sometime soon afterwards

1095
01:45:13,453 --> 01:45:16,843
that certain of
Miss Dunning's guests were robbed.

1096
01:45:16,933 --> 01:45:18,844
Yes.

1097
01:45:18,933 --> 01:45:22,050
- How many times did this happen?
- 16.

1098
01:45:22,133 --> 01:45:25,284
- 16 parties, 16 thefts?
- Yes.

1099
01:45:25,373 --> 01:45:27,967
And Sir Charles attended
all 16 of those parties?

1100
01:45:28,053 --> 01:45:32,524
- All of them.
- And how many parties did you attend?

1101
01:45:32,613 --> 01:45:36,242
- All of them.
- Oh, yes? Very interesting.

1102
01:45:38,093 --> 01:45:41,847
- You attended the first party?
- Yes.

1103
01:45:41,933 --> 01:45:45,721
The jewels were stolen
during or after the party?

1104
01:45:45,813 --> 01:45:48,532
- After.
- So, then, you knew they would be stolen.

1105
01:45:48,613 --> 01:45:50,729
- Yes.
- How did you know?

1106
01:45:50,813 --> 01:45:55,364
Because that is the modus operandi of
the Phantom. He always works that way.

1107
01:45:56,213 --> 01:45:58,522
I see.

1108
01:45:59,693 --> 01:46:02,810
Were the same people
always present at each party?

1109
01:46:02,893 --> 01:46:05,965
No. The guest list varied.

1110
01:46:06,053 --> 01:46:11,081
Outside of Sir Charles, was anybody else
always present at each of these parties?

1111
01:46:11,173 --> 01:46:13,403
Uh... no, no, no.

1112
01:46:14,093 --> 01:46:18,291
Only Sir Charles was present at
each party when there was a robbery?

1113
01:46:18,373 --> 01:46:20,603
- Yes, yes.
- I see.

1114
01:46:22,053 --> 01:46:24,328
- What about you?
- Me?

1115
01:46:24,413 --> 01:46:27,530
- Yes, you.
- What about me?

1116
01:46:27,613 --> 01:46:29,524
- You were there.
- Yes.

1117
01:46:29,613 --> 01:46:33,526
Then, Sir Charles was not the only one
always present at each party.

1118
01:46:33,613 --> 01:46:37,970
- What are you suggesting?
- I'm not suggesting anything... yet.

1119
01:46:41,773 --> 01:46:44,571
- Now, Inspector Clouseau?
- Hm?

1120
01:46:44,653 --> 01:46:47,451
How much money do you make?

1121
01:46:48,213 --> 01:46:50,852
- What has this got to do with it?
- Your salary.

1122
01:46:50,933 --> 01:46:54,084
How much does
a police inspector get paid?

1123
01:46:54,173 --> 01:46:58,132
Enough to buy your wife
a $10,000 mink coat?

1124
01:46:58,213 --> 01:46:59,612
No.

1125
01:46:59,693 --> 01:47:05,051
You're aware that your wife spent $7,000
at Yves Saint Laurent only last month?

1126
01:47:05,133 --> 01:47:08,364
- What?
- And two months before that, $4,000?

1127
01:47:08,453 --> 01:47:09,442
Impossible.

1128
01:47:09,533 --> 01:47:13,731
We know that your wife spent $30,000
on clothes during the past year.

1129
01:47:13,813 --> 01:47:17,169
So my wife is frugal. She saves
out of the housekeeping money.

1130
01:47:17,253 --> 01:47:19,483
<i>(laughter)</i>

1132
01:47:23,253 --> 01:47:25,813
$30,000 out of the housekeeping money?!

1133
01:47:25,893 --> 01:47:28,726
- Yes. We have been married for ten years.
- <i>(laughter)</i>

<i>(bell)</i>

1135
01:47:31,093 --> 01:47:35,166
At the time these robberies began, the
Phantom came into existence. Correct?

1136
01:47:35,253 --> 01:47:37,562
Yes. No! No, not correct.

1137
01:47:37,653 --> 01:47:40,690
Of course not correct. Of course...

1138
01:47:42,093 --> 01:47:44,049
Wait. You see...

1139
01:47:44,133 --> 01:47:45,930
<i>(gasping)</i>

1140
01:47:46,013 --> 01:47:49,164

He must be the Phantom!

1141
01:47:49,253 --> 01:47:51,721
<i>(woman no 2)</i> It must be the inspector.

1142
01:47:54,813 --> 01:47:57,281
- Now, Insp...

<i>(cheering)</i>

1144
01:48:21,853 --> 01:48:24,413
No, I'm not the Phantom!
No. Please, please.

1145
01:48:33,293 --> 01:48:35,807
- Thank you, darling.
- Thank the princess.

1146
01:48:35,893 --> 01:48:39,044
- Look at that.
- You're wrong. I'm not the Phantom.

1147
01:48:39,133 --> 01:48:41,010
No, no, no!

1148
01:48:41,813 --> 01:48:45,522
- We can't let him rot in prison.
- It takes years for people to rot.

1149
01:48:45,613 --> 01:48:49,572
Besides, when the Phantom strikes again,
the inspector will be free.

1150
01:48:49,653 --> 01:48:52,042
Want to come to South America?
Family rates.

1151
01:48:52,133 --> 01:48:54,169
- I wouldn't miss it.
- That's good.

1152
01:48:54,253 --> 01:48:58,007
And who knows? When I retire,
you might take over the business.

1153
01:49:03,613 --> 01:49:05,604
<i>(crowd cheers)</i>

Crazy woman!

1156
01:49:15,373 --> 01:49:18,922
- She tried to tear off all his clothes.
- My wife.

1157
01:49:19,013 --> 01:49:20,492
Wife?

1158
01:49:20,573 --> 01:49:22,928
You can thank my mother for the flowers.

1159
01:49:23,013 --> 01:49:26,403
You're a national hero. I envy you.

1160
01:49:26,493 --> 01:49:29,371
- For going to prison.
- A few years.

1161
01:49:29,453 --> 01:49:32,445
But after you get out... aha!

1162
01:49:36,733 --> 01:49:39,452
Tell me, Inspector... Signor Phantom...

1163
01:49:40,733 --> 01:49:44,726
all those robberies,
how did you ever manage it?

1164
01:49:47,613 --> 01:49:49,604
Well, you know...

1165
01:49:51,373 --> 01:49:53,364
it wasn't easy.
