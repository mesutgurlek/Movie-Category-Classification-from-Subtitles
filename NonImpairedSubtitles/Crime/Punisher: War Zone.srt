1
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,777
Reputed crime boss Gaetano Chezere...

2
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:51,258
Once again avoided prison
when a mistrial was declared

3
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:54,441
today in his 8-week-long RICO prosecution.

4
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:57,041
Allegedly responsible for over 200 murders,

5
00:00:57,076 --> 00:01:00,079
Chezere has yet to spend one day behind bars.

6
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:05,641
Mr Eugene Gordlock, a witness that repeatedly
asked to be recused from the case

7
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:08,813
was gunned down just a few hours earlier.

8
00:01:16,236 --> 00:01:20,440
Punisher - War Zone


9
00:02:51,907 --> 00:02:54,907
left all alone in a city outraged
by today's developments

10
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,949
No concrete evidence of tampering,
and with Mr Gordlock now dead...

11
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,916
Do I fix your
make up for you?

12
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,493
Come on.

13
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:58,282
You know so, the captain should have
sent me out here with 30 or 40 men

14
00:03:58,282 --> 00:03:59,419
to raze this bloody get out of jail party.

15
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:00,954
Instead I'm stuck here with you.

16
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:02,423
He might come out tonight.

17
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,331
As a matter of fact I'm
pretty sure he's going to show up.

18
00:04:06,536 --> 00:04:09,577
And what are you going to do?

19
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:10,704
I'm going to bring him in.

20
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:16,756
You know, you kill me so.
Let's just say you can make this happen.

21
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:18,261
Why would you?

22
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,541
He does to those bastard what
me and you can only fantasize about

23
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:30,671
Hey, keep your nose clean.
-Yeah, sure thing pops.

24
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,586
Hey, Okay now, I was just, uh...
Take it easy in there, ok?

25
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:43,696
Nicky

26
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:44,749
What am I going to do?

27
00:04:44,894 --> 00:04:47,090
Give the old guy a heart attack?

28
00:04:53,547 --> 00:04:55,913
Go on, beat it.
- Give me una minuto.

29
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:02,055
You handled the witness situation...

30
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,363
... perfectly.

31
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:05,832
No sweat, Uncle G.

32
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:11,034
You look great?

33
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,263
The hell I do.
I shit in a bag for Christ's sake.

34
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:16,995
Hey, it saves you a
trip to the can, right?

35
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:19,605
You came to discuss a private matter.

36
00:05:20,677 --> 00:05:23,809
Down at the docks!
-Right yeah, Cristu Bulat.

37
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:25,988
I hear he's a sick fucker...

38
00:05:26,157 --> 00:05:27,642
...fresh off the boat.

39
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:30,155
Cristu's bringing in a shipment.
Needs a safe port.

40
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,339
I've arranged for my custom's guy
Simmons to be on that night...

41
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:36,107
The union boys will be there to unload
Our cut's 10 mil.

42
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:37,541
We won't break a sweat.

43
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:41,886
10 mil. What's Cristu's shipment?
-I don't know.

44
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:47,736
Some kind of biological package.
-Biological package!

45
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,672
I fucking knew it!

46
00:05:50,413 --> 00:05:52,942
Probably going up to
the rag heads in Queens.

47
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,951
Cristu's guaranteed it's leaving the city.

48
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:57,163
We don't touch that kind that shit!

49
00:05:57,363 --> 00:06:00,270
In case your memory is going along with
the rest of your bodily functions...

50
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,868
... you might like to remember,
I'm the top earner around here.

51
00:06:02,977 --> 00:06:04,776
I'm not stupid.
- Stupido.

52
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:08,176
You're as shithouse crazy as your brother,...

53
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:10,382
...Loony Bin Jimmy.

54
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:14,264
I should have had the
both of you locked away!

55
00:06:14,436 --> 00:06:17,068
One more word about my brother,
I swear to Christ I'll....

56
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:20,109
You know what,
you make one move you greasy fuck!

57
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:23,485
Hey, let's just all calm down here, ok.

58
00:06:26,598 --> 00:06:28,636
I put on a big spread out here,

59
00:06:28,636 --> 00:06:30,000
So come on boys.

60
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:31,299
Eat up!

61
00:06:37,724 --> 00:06:40,197
I'm not fucking eating with that
shit bag. You understand?

62
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,596
Pittzy, pour me a drink!

63
00:07:25,994 --> 00:07:27,193
Vaffanculo!

64
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:28,885
What the fuck?

65
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:24,358
Let's go!

66
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:02,529
Alright, let's split up.
Shouldn't we wait for back up?

67
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:17,628
Police! Freeze!

68
00:09:26,654 --> 00:09:28,755
Listen, Billy Russoti is getting away.

69
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:30,294
The silver Rover.

70
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:32,891
Might want to head out to the docks first.

71
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:44,626
Shit! That hurt!

72
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:49,876
What happen to you?

73
00:09:50,177 --> 00:09:54,016
Your Punisher. He disarmed me, held me at gunpoint
then he stole my damn ride.

74
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,679
And where the hell were you, huh?

75
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,594
I know he would come.
Let me get your statement.

76
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:02,395
Come on, Cesare, tell me everything.

77
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:03,908
How'd it go down? Huh?

78
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:30,505
-muffled-

79
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:34,316
Oh well. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise.

80
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:39,690
It's time for me to take over
anyway, thanks to the Punisher!

81
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,394
I won't even get my fucking hands dirty.

82
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:45,143
There's your problem.

83
00:11:46,483 --> 00:11:48,311
What the fuck he doing here?
-Relax!

84
00:11:48,387 --> 00:11:49,546
I asked him to come.

85
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:53,359
My man. How are you doing?

86
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,928
Who the fuck are these fanooks?

87
00:11:55,135 --> 00:11:56,765
These are a couple of my colleagues.

88
00:11:57,743 --> 00:11:59,372
They are very very...

89
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:02,711
...gifted deliverymen.
No mountain too high. No river...

90
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:03,912
...too deep.

91
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:08,129
Alright, alright...enough!

92
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:09,660
Pittsy, get me some money.

93
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,006
Time to go to work.

94
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:12,602
Running a little low, boss.

95
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:15,543
We just picked up 200K from
the Luciano Construction site.

96
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:17,756
I had to launder it
through the Pussy Cat lounge

97
00:12:17,756 --> 00:12:19,283
Like you told me, remember?

98
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:23,169
Well bring it back tomorrow.
- You got it boss.

99
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:28,448
Here. That's 20 rolls of hundreds.
That's a grand each, all counted.

100
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,783
Head for the port. Do your monkey thing.
Get over the security fence. Hand out the money.

101
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:35,151
Hey, where the fuck you going?

102
00:12:35,364 --> 00:12:39,601
Will it be alright if
I took the roof instead of the door?

103
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:40,366
Whatever.

104
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:41,545
You're a fucking saint.

105
00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:14,943
Hey, what's the matter?

106
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:53,840
Fuck!

107
00:13:54,016 --> 00:13:54,864
What the fuck with that?

108
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:56,714
Agent down! Repeat, agent down! Fuck!

109
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,016
I'll check it out boss.

110
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,031
Pop!
-No, I'l take care of it.

111
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:15,096
You get the guards!

112
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:16,862
Pittsy!

113
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:32,965
Fuck!
Fuck you Castle!

114
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,475
Come on, Frank!

115
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,131
Fuck you, Frank!
Fuck you Castle you fuckin...

116
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:00,334
Pittsy! Pittsy!

117
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:02,935
There he is!

118
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,101
FBl, drop your weapons!

119
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:55,932
Oh shit! Shit!

120
00:15:56,337 --> 00:15:57,202
You two, up the stairs.
The rest, behind me.

121
00:15:59,210 --> 00:15:59,768
Don't move!

122
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,413
FBI

123
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:02,443
Put your weapons down!

124
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:03,432
We got a live one!

125
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:06,673
Billy the Beaut!

126
00:18:09,616 --> 00:18:10,345
Not anymore, eh?

127
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:16,216
Wait a minute.

128
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:26,723
The Lord is compassion and love.

129
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:29,390
Slow to anger and rich in mercy.

130
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,238
He does not treat us according to our sin,
nor repay us according to our faults

131
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:39,017
As parents have compassion on their children

132
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,492
The Lord had pity of those here.

133
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:47,101
For he know of what we are made.
He remembers that we are dust

134
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,810
And for us, our days are like grass.

135
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,688
We flower like a flower in a field.

136
00:18:54,688 --> 00:19:00,258
The wind blows and we are gone,
and our place never sees us again.

137
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,693
I'm so sorry for your loss.
-Thank you.

138
00:19:25,027 --> 00:19:26,462
Who compromised Donatelli?

139
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:29,134
Calm down Budiansky.
It wasn't anybody's fault.

140
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,677
None of us could have foreseen Frank Castle
opening up hunting season on La Cosa Nostra.

141
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:33,576
Come on!

142
00:19:34,014 --> 00:19:36,436
Look, Donatelli sent us a message.

143
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:38,771
He said something big is going to happen.

144
00:19:38,826 --> 00:19:42,468
He asked for Homeland Security. We've
been running 24 hours surveillance on Russoti.

145
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:44,606
And just as we were about to find
out what the fuck is happening,

146
00:19:44,606 --> 00:19:46,510
Donatelli got shot
believe me!

147
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,248
No one's more pissed off about it than I am!

148
00:19:48,248 --> 00:19:50,820
How is it we are not all over Frank Castle?

149
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,330
Because we have real National Security
threat, and the last time I checked

150
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,799
that tops trying to stop some
crazed vigilante.

151
00:19:57,937 --> 00:19:58,734
Go!

152
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,644
Hey.
- Hey.

153
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:08,352
I'm going to get this guy Angie.

154
00:20:09,665 --> 00:20:11,032
I promise you.

155
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,864
I heard the Bureau
was sending a baby sitter.

156
00:21:51,303 --> 00:21:53,571
A liaison.
-Thirty years on the force.

157
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:56,211
I still don't know what that word means.

158
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:59,549
We have a certain way of doing
things around here, Special Agent Budiansky.

159
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:02,495
Like letting mass murderers run free?

160
00:22:02,964 --> 00:22:05,664
4 years, this Punisher
has been wreaking havoc.

161
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:08,711
And you haven't once caught a break.

162
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:10,511
I'm always deep in shit
around here as you can plainly see.

163
00:22:13,355 --> 00:22:16,386
Your buddies from the Bureau told me
the city is under some kind of terror threat

164
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:21,199
New Yorkers are a bit sensitive
about that if you know what I mean.

165
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:25,313
I've got all my men trying to find out what
your late colleague came across when he went under.

166
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:31,832
Maybe if you Feds allowed us lowly cops
in on your undercover operations once in a while

167
00:22:31,832 --> 00:22:33,336
all of this could have been avoided.

168
00:22:33,396 --> 00:22:36,002
With all due respect, Captain,...

169
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:39,105
that, is bullshit!

170
00:22:39,751 --> 00:22:41,989
What if it had been your man lying there, huh?

171
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:44,018
in a pool of his own blood?

172
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:50,409
You crispy crème mother fuckers
would be beating down every door in the city

173
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:53,439
Captain. Captain, You know what?

174
00:22:54,085 --> 00:22:58,288
The Punisher task force could
use an extra man.

175
00:23:04,107 --> 00:23:05,771
Room 12,

176
00:23:06,914 --> 00:23:07,506
The basement.

177
00:23:26,294 --> 00:23:30,292
Ah, Agent Budiansky?
Did I get that right?

178
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,741
Captain told me you were coming in.

179
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,811
Welcome to the Punisher task force.

180
00:23:36,084 --> 00:23:38,555
I'm Detective Martin Soap.
Pleasure.

181
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,426
Make yourself at home.
-You have a degree in behavioral psychology

182
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:49,003
Surprised?
That's okay, most people are.

183
00:23:51,151 --> 00:23:53,715
So, what do you actually do here?

184
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:56,319
Here?
- Uh huh.

185
00:23:56,379 --> 00:23:57,806
This is ground zero.

186
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,734
I shadowed his every step for the last five years.

187
00:24:02,712 --> 00:24:06,653
I've documented every murder that fit his profile.

188
00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:09,920
I've collected intelligence on all known associates.

189
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:12,194
Take the look at this.

190
00:24:14,472 --> 00:24:16,000
Six years ago,

191
00:24:16,244 --> 00:24:18,680
Frank Castle was a
Special Forces instructor

192
00:24:21,422 --> 00:24:26,697
And a simple family man. One day
he takes his wife and kids for a picnic

193
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,770
And by chance or fate,
depending on which you believe in,

194
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,276
they witnessed a mob execution.

195
00:24:34,387 --> 00:24:36,482
When they were discovered.

196
00:24:38,932 --> 00:24:40,991
Castle survived.

197
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,710
Since then, he's been taking down
one crime family after another.

198
00:24:51,693 --> 00:24:54,291
I'm really close, Budiansky

199
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:57,500
The only thing getting
in my way is some bad luck.

200
00:24:59,112 --> 00:25:01,310
But I have a feeling
that's about to change.

201
00:25:02,687 --> 00:25:04,623
You know, I've
been waiting for someone like you.

202
00:25:06,764 --> 00:25:08,561
Take a look at some of the case files.

203
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:13,108
Get the lay of land. I'll get us a pie
from Melanos. Best pizza in the city

204
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,781
With drawer?
-What?

205
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,978
The alleged Punisher murders.

206
00:25:19,694 --> 00:25:21,128
All of them.

207
00:25:58,952 --> 00:26:00,455
What do you want, Micro?

208
00:26:00,455 --> 00:26:03,664
You ever heard of Jahadiblogger.com?

209
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:08,298
I'm posing as a one-arm Wahabi warrior
who took a crap in a cave next to bin Laden.

210
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:11,414
I think I can score you a couple of rocket launchers.

211
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:12,940
What do you want?

212
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:16,049
I haven't seen you in a while.

213
00:26:18,631 --> 00:26:22,231
I brought you some treats.
It's gun show season in Virginia

214
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,271
No background checks, no problems.

215
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:29,991
That's too much Frank.

216
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:32,463
Call it a retirement package.

217
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:38,941
Look I know this thing with the Fed is eating you
up inside but that doesn't mean that you pack up your tent.

218
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,972
We all make the mistakes Frank.

219
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,521
You are fighting a war...

220
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:46,964
against the assholes who slip through
the raindrops. Who get away with it.

221
00:26:46,964 --> 00:26:49,493
In any war there is collateral damage.
You know that.

222
00:26:50,005 --> 00:26:51,908
Collateral damage?

223
00:26:56,988 --> 00:27:00,224
I killed an agent in the field.
One of the good guys.

224
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:03,897
He had a family.

225
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:05,699
You didn't know.

226
00:27:08,315 --> 00:27:10,149
I fucked up Micro.

227
00:27:12,927 --> 00:27:15,624
Now please, just leave me alone.

228
00:27:34,644 --> 00:27:36,510
Where the fuck is Nicky?

229
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:41,789
He didn't make it.
-Nicky was a fucking rat.

230
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,494
For the Feds.

231
00:27:45,502 --> 00:27:47,063
What about my money?

232
00:27:48,777 --> 00:27:50,714
We already went
to his place and tore it apart.

233
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,086
No sign of the safety deposit key or nothing.

234
00:27:53,688 --> 00:27:55,353
Does he got any next of kin?

235
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,292
Somebody to carry
on the family name?

236
00:27:58,507 --> 00:28:01,259
Yeah. Paper said something
about a wife and a little girl.

237
00:28:01,506 --> 00:28:04,803
Good. Let's look there.
- You got it.

238
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,522
Hey, Buck! Where you been?

239
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:10,120
Am I glad to see you.
- Hi Billy.

240
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:13,234
You should have seen those
fucking brashules at the clinic.

241
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:16,363
They must have bought their
fucking degrees off of the internet.

242
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,379
How the heck did you end up at a free clinic?

243
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:20,718
Insurance said I missed a payment.

244
00:28:20,718 --> 00:28:22,522
Can you fucking believe that?

245
00:28:22,522 --> 00:28:26,232
Yeah, before we do this,
I need you to understand.

246
00:28:26,232 --> 00:28:28,401
The severity of your injuries
when you arrived here.

247
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:31,009
Statistically speaking you
shouldn't have been able to survive this.

248
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,113
Well that's why I'm here, Doc.

249
00:28:33,113 --> 00:28:35,987
I have the best plastic surgeon
in all of New York.

250
00:28:35,987 --> 00:28:42,435
Your facial muscles, tendons,
bone structure, everything - it was destroyed.

251
00:28:42,435 --> 00:28:44,674
There wasn't a single
square inch of skin

252
00:28:44,674 --> 00:28:45,811
left intact.

253
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:48,450
Just take it off already.

254
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,081
Ok, let's do this.

255
00:28:52,895 --> 00:28:55,695
Now I need you to sit
forward a little bit.

256
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,993
Alright.

257
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,247
Ok!

258
00:29:04,748 --> 00:29:05,948
Polymers

259
00:29:11,604 --> 00:29:14,635
strategically placed alloy plates,

260
00:29:16,984 --> 00:29:20,389
And just a little bit of horse hide.

261
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:21,591
A little what?

262
00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:36,692
I need to talk to my doctor alone.

263
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:39,099
Yeah, of course, Billy.

264
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,454
What the fuck's the matter with you?

265
00:29:46,454 --> 00:29:48,090
You can't fuckin' control yourself?

266
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,196
You know how sensitive
he is about his looks.

267
00:29:50,196 --> 00:29:55,103
Sorry Pops, it's just that I've never
seen anything so...  -Just shut the fuck up!

268
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:24,609
You ok boss?

269
00:30:24,877 --> 00:30:26,436
Much better, thanks.

270
00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:41,775
I'll be in the car.

271
00:30:51,638 --> 00:30:53,076
No more distractions.

272
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:54,879
We need to focus on my goals.

273
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:56,348
One.

274
00:30:57,385 --> 00:30:58,979
We need to get my money back.

275
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,395
Two. We gonna get rid of Frank Castle.

276
00:31:01,395 --> 00:31:03,199
Well...

277
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:04,703
He took out like 30 of us. I mean-

278
00:31:04,703 --> 00:31:08,044
How are we gonna kill him
before he'll kill us?

279
00:31:08,044 --> 00:31:09,581
My brother will take care of that.

280
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:11,814
Loony Bin Jim?
-Shut the fuck up.

281
00:31:12,354 --> 00:31:14,725
His name is James.

282
00:31:14,928 --> 00:31:16,766
Not Loony Bin Jim.

283
00:31:16,766 --> 00:31:20,106
Not LBJ, James.
-I'm sorry.

284
00:31:20,106 --> 00:31:23,273
It was a good idea Really, It is.

285
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,552
Don't mind him.

286
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,390
He doesn't think before he talks.

287
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,461
Just like his mother.

288
00:31:29,461 --> 00:31:31,567
Sorry about that Billy.

289
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:33,872
Billy is dead.

290
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:38,577
From now on, you call me Jigsaw.

291
00:33:08,094 --> 00:33:10,965
How are we doing today,
Loony Bin Jim?

292
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:25,456
Yummy yummy.

293
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:31,915
So good.

294
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:36,160
What?

295
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,797
Doctor Basner. Open up.

296
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:39,289
Yes, doctor.

297
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,606
Billy?

298
00:34:01,018 --> 00:34:02,715
Is that you?

299
00:34:05,997 --> 00:34:07,192
It is.

300
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:10,873
You look fantastic, brother.

301
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:19,825
Ink, cut these off. Now.

302
00:34:20,663 --> 00:34:23,693
Pittsy, go open the doors of every other cell.

303
00:34:23,904 --> 00:34:25,675
Lead everybody out at the front door.

304
00:34:25,675 --> 00:34:28,705
Sure thing, Billy... Jigsaw.

305
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,084
I'll take care of this guy.

306
00:34:32,256 --> 00:34:37,257
Oh no brother. Fatso is mine.

307
00:34:37,937 --> 00:34:39,338
Of course.

308
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,980
I'm gonna get my apple sauce back.

309
00:34:46,391 --> 00:34:48,128
Did you know...

310
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:53,129
Kidneys in apple sauce are
a delicacy in Sweden?

311
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:58,141
Did you know that? Yes.

312
00:34:59,755 --> 00:35:05,461
Yummy yummy yummy,
in my tummy tummy tummy.

313
00:35:14,222 --> 00:35:15,817
What do ya say boss?

314
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,429
Stuff might come in handy.

315
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:18,499
What for?

316
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:22,339
Well, in case he starts,
you know, not feeling so good.

317
00:35:28,155 --> 00:35:30,024
He's doing just great.

318
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:05,442
You're in my light.

319
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:20,870
For the next time someone
gets in your light.

320
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:31,703
Stay the fuck away from my little girl.

321
00:36:31,703 --> 00:36:34,974
Mom! That's a bad word.
-Go inside, Grace.

322
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:43,128
You're messing with the wrong family
on the wrong day, asshole.

323
00:36:46,473 --> 00:36:49,206
You... You are...

324
00:36:50,415 --> 00:36:52,053
What are you doing here?

325
00:36:52,053 --> 00:36:54,357
What makes you think you can come here?

326
00:36:54,357 --> 00:36:56,731
You scared the girl.
-Shut up.

327
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:58,665
Just shut your mouth.

328
00:37:00,171 --> 00:37:02,336
I'm sorry.
-I said shut up.

329
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,044
What's this?

330
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:10,453
Something to help out.
-No.

331
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:13,234
No, you don't get to do that.

332
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,377
You don't get to shoot my husband
in cold blood...

333
00:37:16,377 --> 00:37:17,713
and did stuff with the ATM.

334
00:37:17,713 --> 00:37:20,207
It's for your daughter.

335
00:37:20,387 --> 00:37:22,448
This is what you deserve.

336
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:25,932
What you did to Nicky.

337
00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:31,975
Who punishes you?

338
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,453
He taught you how to shoot.

339
00:37:37,894 --> 00:37:40,092
Good agent keeps his family safe.

340
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:42,196
He couldn't always be here.

341
00:37:44,943 --> 00:37:46,777
Took the out to the range.

342
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,950
Showed you what to do.

343
00:37:52,328 --> 00:37:54,561
This... is where you do it.

344
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,570
Squeeze.

345
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:01,670
Don't pull.

346
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:15,147
I can't find my red pen.

347
00:38:18,723 --> 00:38:20,991
Mom? I need it.

348
00:38:27,577 --> 00:38:29,206
Take it.

349
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:15,647
Is this it boss?
- Yeah.

350
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,483
Nice brother.

351
00:39:17,996 --> 00:39:19,734
Is it yours?

352
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:20,401
Not yet.

353
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:23,032
Ol' Cesare used to
rent it to screw hookers

354
00:39:23,676 --> 00:39:26,613
Let's go inside before I freeze
my fucking balls off.

355
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:46,590
What's the matter, Billy?

356
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:52,771
Just when I think I'm Ok
I see my reflection somewhere and ...

357
00:39:54,748 --> 00:39:56,548
I look horrible.

358
00:39:59,024 --> 00:40:00,961
What has he done to me?

359
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:05,874
Oh no... don't cry, brother.

360
00:40:05,874 --> 00:40:08,615
Everything is gonna be alright.

361
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,855
I promise you two things.

362
00:40:11,855 --> 00:40:15,899
One, I will find Castle and
I will kill him.

363
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:19,237
Slowly and painfully.

364
00:40:19,237 --> 00:40:26,422
And two, you will never ever have to
look at your reflection again,

365
00:40:26,422 --> 00:40:28,791
as long as you're with me.

366
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,075
- Speaking in Russian -

367
00:41:36,253 --> 00:41:38,657
You're not in Transylvania anymore Cristu.

368
00:41:39,495 --> 00:41:41,265
We don't talk vampire.

369
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:44,203
It's Russian,...

370
00:41:45,843 --> 00:41:48,415
My men is concerned.

371
00:41:48,415 --> 00:41:51,047
If Punisher can do this to your face,

372
00:41:51,857 --> 00:41:54,095
what might he do to our deal?

373
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:57,797
The tongue stretches further than
most people think.

374
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:01,544
Ask your man how he's gonna talk
that shit,

375
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:03,785
when I pull it from his mouth.

376
00:42:03,785 --> 00:42:05,310
Or you'll what?

377
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,162
Enough!

378
00:42:08,162 --> 00:42:10,267
The Punisher is not a problem.

379
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:12,133
The docks are mine.

380
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,074
My looks have nothing to do with this.

381
00:42:15,946 --> 00:42:17,643
Everybody.

382
00:42:17,817 --> 00:42:21,122
From local security to international
customs is in my pocket.

383
00:42:21,827 --> 00:42:26,167
Quite frankly. This job doesn't get done
without me.

384
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:29,067
What do you think?

385
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:33,046
It seems he is right.

386
00:42:33,521 --> 00:42:35,253
We do not need monster.

387
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,869
Shit!

388
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:52,598
Stop!

389
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,139
My most sincere apologies.

390
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:13,842
My father always say never insult
your host.

391
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:16,854
Sounds like a reasonable man.

392
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,224
You don't know my father.

393
00:43:27,047 --> 00:43:28,607
Three days.

394
00:43:29,052 --> 00:43:31,249
It has to be 12 million.

395
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:37,202
We agreed on 10.
- We both know ...

396
00:43:37,371 --> 00:43:41,404
that this biological shit you're
bringing in isn't leaving the city.

397
00:43:42,349 --> 00:43:46,090
You're selling it to the ragheads
in Queens.

398
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,730
The ports been crawling with suits
from Homeland.

399
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:51,966
It's going to take a lot of payola
to keep it quiet.

400
00:44:02,397 --> 00:44:05,666
I always knew you'd be a good boss, Billy

401
00:44:05,867 --> 00:44:07,267
Thanks brother.

402
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,933
Latin kings.

403
00:44:51,278 --> 00:44:53,516
Let him go, Frank.

404
00:44:53,516 --> 00:44:55,520
You know this piece of shit?

405
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,055
Ex piece of shit.
-Yeah.

406
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:00,568
He's a regular choir boy.

407
00:45:00,696 --> 00:45:02,649
Fuck you, cracker.
-Language!

408
00:45:02,779 --> 00:45:04,309
It's a genius racket.

409
00:45:04,429 --> 00:45:07,146
You know how the cops are
always running those guns buy backs?

410
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,018
Except they never work.

411
00:45:09,134 --> 00:45:12,751
Because what banger
is gonna trust a cop, right?

412
00:45:13,865 --> 00:45:17,473
Well, these drive by whack jobs,
they just love Carlos here.

413
00:45:17,473 --> 00:45:21,779
They get one look at that lnk,
and they know he's for real.

414
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:25,894
We get the guns of the streets to you

415
00:45:25,894 --> 00:45:29,763
Never once seen a banger that could quit.
Too fucking stupid.

416
00:45:31,939 --> 00:45:33,170
He's straight, Frank.

417
00:45:34,879 --> 00:45:38,615
Hey ma! Frank's here.
He says eat up.

418
00:45:40,493 --> 00:45:42,019
How is she doing?

419
00:45:42,798 --> 00:45:44,670
Yeah well...

420
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:48,476
As long as she's got her cooking shows,
she's good.

421
00:45:49,983 --> 00:45:51,680
It's the only thing she notices.

422
00:45:51,886 --> 00:45:54,052
But hey that's something, right?

423
00:45:57,866 --> 00:45:58,458
Listen. I-

424
00:46:00,138 --> 00:46:03,045
I just came around to tell you I'm
going out of town for a while.

425
00:46:03,715 --> 00:46:04,238
Out of town?

426
00:46:09,295 --> 00:46:11,367
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

427
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:15,537
I never thought of the Punisher, you know
taking a long weekend.

428
00:46:15,744 --> 00:46:17,647
I'm not planning on coming back.

429
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:21,681
So I take it things didn't go so well
at the Donatelli home.

430
00:46:23,528 --> 00:46:25,396
Are you aware that Billy Russoti survived?

431
00:46:27,636 --> 00:46:28,832
I heard.

432
00:46:30,277 --> 00:46:33,083
Let the cops take care of him.

433
00:46:33,103 --> 00:46:35,572
You and I know they got nothing on him.

434
00:46:35,588 --> 00:46:36,926
Their hands are tied.

435
00:46:36,926 --> 00:46:38,597
This is where the Punisher comes in.

436
00:46:38,647 --> 00:46:41,795
This is why I believe in you.
Why I've supported you all these years.

437
00:46:41,837 --> 00:46:43,406
You want me to tell you when
something happens to...

438
00:46:43,446 --> 00:46:44,907
Mrs. Donatelli and her daughter?

439
00:46:44,977 --> 00:46:47,117
Because that's what's gonna happen.

440
00:46:47,157 --> 00:46:49,054
You don't think he's gonna go
for revenge?

441
00:46:49,064 --> 00:46:51,415
It's not a question of if.
it's just a matter of when.

442
00:47:02,285 --> 00:47:04,415
Pull a couple of Berettas.
-For what?

443
00:47:07,296 --> 00:47:10,028
3, 2, 1

444
00:47:14,113 --> 00:47:16,051
Russoti is the last one.

445
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:17,185
Then I'm done.

446
00:47:17,285 --> 00:47:18,790
For your own lips to God's ears.

447
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,061
You know where I can find him.

448
00:47:20,121 --> 00:47:22,233
I don't have a fix on him.

449
00:47:22,233 --> 00:47:25,172
You wiped out all of his associates
that are known to me.

450
00:47:25,172 --> 00:47:27,913
I saw him with some new guys.
The leader was black.

451
00:47:27,913 --> 00:47:29,348
Dreadlocks.

452
00:47:29,448 --> 00:47:31,682
Doing some kind of acrobatic
stuff over the roofs.

453
00:47:31,732 --> 00:47:34,026
That's Maginty and his
Urban Freeflow Gang.

454
00:47:34,066 --> 00:47:35,764
He's a mean motherfucker.

455
00:47:35,764 --> 00:47:37,864
He's on a constant meth high.

456
00:47:45,651 --> 00:47:46,854
Well come on.

457
00:47:47,123 --> 00:47:49,295
You want to find this guy or not?

458
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:54,938
You boys play nice.

459
00:48:04,365 --> 00:48:05,968
I've been looking for you.

460
00:48:05,968 --> 00:48:08,404
Agent Budiansky. Take a load off.

461
00:48:08,504 --> 00:48:10,111
I need to go see Castle.

462
00:48:10,211 --> 00:48:12,952
Where do I find him?
-Brats, you know.

463
00:48:13,052 --> 00:48:13,743
He just left.

464
00:48:15,189 --> 00:48:16,921
Wait...

465
00:48:17,396 --> 00:48:18,558
You know what I like to do.

466
00:48:18,766 --> 00:48:25,042
I like to sit in my car and listen
to the CB Radio and follow the crime.

467
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:28,454
I might just run into him.

468
00:48:28,454 --> 00:48:30,460
It's never worked for me
in five years now.

469
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,432
But I'm not the luckiest guy
on the planet, you know.

470
00:48:49,303 --> 00:48:51,103
Let's get through the back door.

471
00:49:08,014 --> 00:49:10,713
Maginty and his boys are planning to hit
a convenience store of 45th and 2nd.

472
00:49:28,101 --> 00:49:29,863
Suspects are armed and dangerous.

473
00:49:30,043 --> 00:49:33,158
I repeat.
Suspects are armed and dangerous.

474
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,268
Let's do this.

475
00:49:37,213 --> 00:49:38,151
Really?

476
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:40,213
Just drive the car.

477
00:49:41,762 --> 00:49:44,233
Come on! Run!

478
00:50:18,244 --> 00:50:19,445
Oh fuck!

479
00:50:34,855 --> 00:50:36,054
Please

480
00:50:36,255 --> 00:50:37,591
Don't kill me.

481
00:50:37,591 --> 00:50:39,797
Russoti, where is he?

482
00:50:39,797 --> 00:50:42,232
Yeah Jigsaw, I was just with him.

483
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:44,606
He was suppose to give us some
dope for a job.

484
00:50:44,606 --> 00:50:46,201
But it turns out...

485
00:50:47,546 --> 00:50:49,449
He don't have any anymore.

486
00:50:49,685 --> 00:50:53,627
He forgot. He botched it.
He be a bastard.

487
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:57,170
So you wanna go see him,
you need to tell him this,

488
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,901
Wee bitch. Take it back.

489
00:51:00,478 --> 00:51:05,251
So tell him, for something,
Mr. Punisher, sir.

490
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:12,439
So when did Donatelli
go undercover?

491
00:51:12,439 --> 00:51:14,578
We were partners in narcotics.

492
00:51:14,578 --> 00:51:15,714
Unfortunately,

493
00:51:15,774 --> 00:51:17,775
most of the blow we confiscated.

494
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,149
ended up in my nose.

495
00:51:19,822 --> 00:51:22,297
Internal Affairs tried to
get Nicky to rat me out.

496
00:51:22,417 --> 00:51:23,564
He wouldn't.

497
00:51:23,624 --> 00:51:25,833
So, they sent him undercover.

498
00:51:27,576 --> 00:51:29,809
He's dead because of me.

499
00:51:32,821 --> 00:51:34,620
So you still skiing the old Alps?

500
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,725
No. That's in the past.

501
00:51:43,811 --> 00:51:45,705
Holy shit!

502
00:51:57,112 --> 00:51:59,812
I'm getting out.
You meet me on the other side.

503
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:28,376
Boo.

504
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,489
Hello, Mrs. Donatelli.

505
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,230
Or will you be calling
yourself 'miss' from now on.

506
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:35,834
What do you want from us?

507
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:37,906
I'm looking for my money.

508
00:52:37,906 --> 00:52:39,878
Which your rat of a husband
stole from me.

509
00:52:39,978 --> 00:52:41,969
But we don't have it. I swear to God.

510
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,830
How about you, sweet cheeks?

511
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:50,601
Would you also like to swear
on an imaginary friend?

512
00:52:53,611 --> 00:52:55,549
Make sure they don't move.

513
00:52:55,549 --> 00:52:57,946
I'll look for the money.
-Come here kid.

514
00:53:02,566 --> 00:53:03,834
Freeze, asshole.

515
00:53:04,034 --> 00:53:06,098
You're under arrest.

516
00:53:23,447 --> 00:53:25,350
Stay out of my way.

517
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:18,008
Listen to me.

518
00:54:18,068 --> 00:54:21,342
Russoti is headed to the Donatelli house.

519
00:54:21,446 --> 00:54:23,181
He's probably already there.

520
00:54:24,257 --> 00:54:26,228
You have to let me go.

521
00:54:26,228 --> 00:54:28,892
You have the right to shut the fuck up.

522
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,039
Good evening, officers.

523
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:30,246
Is everything Ok in there?

524
00:55:30,246 --> 00:55:35,121
No. Everything is not Ok.
Follow me.

525
00:55:44,145 --> 00:55:46,343
Officer.

526
00:55:46,684 --> 00:55:49,315
No you don't!

527
00:56:03,288 --> 00:56:05,293
Well...

528
00:56:05,293 --> 00:56:08,529
This day was about to come sooner
or later, wasn't it?

529
00:56:09,872 --> 00:56:13,004
Have you heard back from the patrol car?

530
00:56:15,051 --> 00:56:16,520
So...

531
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,784
I tried it a couple times.

532
00:56:19,227 --> 00:56:20,560
There was no answer.

533
00:56:29,617 --> 00:56:30,386
Listen.

534
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:33,155
We gotta get out of here before
more pigs arrive.

535
00:56:35,031 --> 00:56:36,501
Where is my fuckin' money?

536
00:56:36,501 --> 00:56:38,538
My husband has a safe upstairs
in the bedroom.

537
00:56:38,714 --> 00:56:41,179
I don't know if it's there but
I can give you the combination.

538
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:43,173
10-12-1965

539
00:56:43,551 --> 00:56:45,322
Oh how cute.

540
00:56:45,322 --> 00:56:47,520
Is that your dead husband's birthday?

541
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:01,549
Let me out here.

542
00:57:08,109 --> 00:57:10,239
Get him to the station.
-You bet.

543
00:57:28,456 --> 00:57:29,415
Let me out.

544
00:57:31,728 --> 00:57:33,668
You know, Frank.

545
00:57:33,668 --> 00:57:36,232
Throwing your tip now and then
is one thing.

546
00:57:36,307 --> 00:57:40,074
Password to the crime database, sure,
but letting you go, so-

547
00:57:41,353 --> 00:57:42,251
Fine.

548
00:57:54,216 --> 00:57:55,549
How you doing?

549
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,324
19.

550
00:58:34,478 --> 00:58:35,742
What was that?

551
00:58:36,616 --> 00:58:37,374
Go check it out.

552
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:42,494
What the fuck you waiting for? Christmas?

553
00:59:10,831 --> 00:59:11,265
Now.

554
00:59:11,265 --> 00:59:13,434
Now, you sit down.

555
00:59:22,556 --> 00:59:23,217
I'm calling this in.

556
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:25,191
Put your hands behind your back.

557
00:59:29,606 --> 00:59:31,975
Goddamnit you asshole!

558
00:59:33,617 --> 00:59:35,484
Where do you think you're going?

559
00:59:36,889 --> 00:59:38,888
Hands up!

560
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:44,532
I repeat,
Request immediate back up.

561
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,167
Don't worry. I'm here.

562
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:57,035
Give me your fucking gun.

563
01:00:01,684 --> 01:00:04,018
Stay right where you fucking are.

564
01:00:07,865 --> 01:00:08,331
We did it, Budiansky, huh?

565
01:00:10,102 --> 01:00:12,001
You mind explaining it to me...

566
01:00:12,107 --> 01:00:15,715
how a handcuffed criminal escapes custody
the back of your locked car?

567
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:19,447
The Castle is a slippery one.

568
01:00:32,655 --> 01:00:34,718
You'll be safe here.

569
01:00:34,861 --> 01:00:36,764
We can manage on our own.

570
01:00:36,906 --> 01:00:38,465
Just until we know Russoti's
been arrested.

571
01:00:43,414 --> 01:00:45,819
Grace.

572
01:00:45,819 --> 01:00:48,088
Grace, you listen, honey.

573
01:00:49,629 --> 01:00:51,155
She's smart.

574
01:00:52,001 --> 01:00:54,038
Go ahead. Open it.

575
01:01:25,714 --> 01:01:27,377
It... belonged to my daughter.

576
01:01:30,056 --> 01:01:30,686
Here.

577
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:39,970
Wow!

578
01:01:53,771 --> 01:01:55,471
Put that down, honey.

579
01:01:57,622 --> 01:02:04,135
This was... Lisa's favorite toy.

580
01:02:04,135 --> 01:02:07,478
She got so angry when her little
brother used to hide it from her.

581
01:02:07,478 --> 01:02:11,248
Does she care if I play with it?

582
01:02:11,621 --> 01:02:13,956
No.

583
01:02:32,269 --> 01:02:35,209
You gonna fry for killing
two of my officers, Billy.

584
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:38,406
I want a lawyer.
- Oh, you'll get your fucking lawyer.

585
01:02:39,153 --> 01:02:41,123
No lawyer's going to get
you out of this one.

586
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,395
Lousy piece of shit.

587
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:04,144
Agent Miller.
What are you doing here?

588
01:03:04,044 --> 01:03:05,179
Russoti.

589
01:03:05,179 --> 01:03:06,984
What's he gotta do with the Bureau?

590
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:08,353
The case Donatelli was
working on.

591
01:03:08,383 --> 01:03:11,055
He says he got some intel to
make a deal for.

592
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:13,466
Anyone know where he is right now?

593
01:03:13,466 --> 01:03:15,371
They just brought him
into the observation room.

594
01:03:15,371 --> 01:03:16,135
Good.

595
01:03:19,246 --> 01:03:20,115
Yeah.

596
01:03:20,215 --> 01:03:21,986
Captain Ross. Agent Miller with the Bureau.

597
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:25,455
I believe you've been informed
I'll be taking over this.

598
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:31,276
This perp killed two of my officers.

599
01:03:31,276 --> 01:03:34,515
And terrorized a widow and child
of one of your agents.

600
01:03:34,515 --> 01:03:36,145
You keep that in mind, Miller.

601
01:03:41,934 --> 01:03:45,173
You're lucky I came to you with this.

602
01:03:45,173 --> 01:03:48,011
But then I'm a patriot just like you.

603
01:03:49,518 --> 01:03:51,254
I shit red white and blue.

604
01:03:51,254 --> 01:03:52,893
The reason you came to me is
because you got caught.

605
01:03:52,893 --> 01:03:56,299
So don't insult my intelligence, Ok?

606
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:57,501
You tell me what you know.

607
01:03:57,531 --> 01:03:59,507
If it's any good,

608
01:03:59,507 --> 01:04:02,344
I'll recommend life without parole.

609
01:04:03,683 --> 01:04:06,212
This deal is going down tonight?

610
01:04:09,398 --> 01:04:12,235
I know when and I know where.

611
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:18,244
So you're gonna give me and my brother
the immunity and the money.

612
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:21,015
Or you're gonna have to explain
to Wolf fucking Blitzer...

613
01:04:22,229 --> 01:04:26,637
why you had a lead on the thing
that killed half of the fucking city,

614
01:04:26,637 --> 01:04:28,872
and you didn't do
a goddamn thing about it.

615
01:04:33,621 --> 01:04:35,693
I'll be right back.

616
01:04:35,693 --> 01:04:37,697
Oh and Miller.

617
01:04:37,697 --> 01:04:39,463
Just that one other little thing.

618
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:44,790
Wow!

619
01:05:45,891 --> 01:05:47,452
Happy?

620
01:06:02,396 --> 01:06:04,595
Shit! You bastard.

621
01:06:05,538 --> 01:06:06,672
You're fucking dead men.

622
01:06:06,772 --> 01:06:09,041
My father will kill you.
Hear me?

623
01:06:09,881 --> 01:06:12,546
My father will serve your head
on a fucking silver platter!

624
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:19,561
Agent Miller.

625
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:21,407
It's agreed.

626
01:06:21,407 --> 01:06:23,310
The other conditions of our agreement?

627
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:26,652
Clear the area.

628
01:06:28,257 --> 01:06:31,957
I hope to God he finds you,
and you get what you deserve.

629
01:06:52,313 --> 01:06:53,283
How long was l-

630
01:06:53,283 --> 01:06:55,788
A long time.

631
01:06:55,788 --> 01:06:57,059
You should eat.

632
01:06:57,059 --> 01:06:58,695
Yuck!
-Grace.

633
01:06:58,695 --> 01:06:59,731
What is it?

634
01:06:59,731 --> 01:07:01,603
Egg and cheese MREs.

635
01:07:01,603 --> 01:07:02,471
That's all I have.

636
01:07:02,471 --> 01:07:03,941
What's an MRE?

637
01:07:03,941 --> 01:07:06,949
Meal. Ready to eat.

638
01:07:06,949 --> 01:07:08,117
Military food.

639
01:07:08,167 --> 01:07:10,591
It's great for people who can't cook.

640
01:07:10,591 --> 01:07:13,962
Look, Grace.
This is gonna come with chuckles.

641
01:07:14,132 --> 01:07:16,533
It's the best one I got.

642
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:18,139
Not exactly a balanced breakfast.

643
01:07:18,139 --> 01:07:20,839
Out of practice.

644
01:07:22,451 --> 01:07:25,984
Not one more step.

645
01:07:31,905 --> 01:07:32,909
Where's Micro?

646
01:07:32,959 --> 01:07:34,010
His mother isn't feeling well.

647
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,080
He didn't want to leave her.

648
01:07:35,095 --> 01:07:35,815
Damn it.

649
01:07:35,845 --> 01:07:38,151
I need to talk to him.

650
01:07:38,689 --> 01:07:39,457
This is Carlos.

651
01:07:39,457 --> 01:07:42,397
He's... a friend of mine.

652
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,673
He's gonna hang while I
take care of some things.

653
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:48,980
Hi Carlos. I'm Grace.

654
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,249
Hey little darling.

655
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:51,750
We're gonna be homies, right?

656
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:55,195
Yeah. we're gonna be tight.

657
01:07:55,195 --> 01:07:56,528
This all will be over soon.

658
01:07:57,735 --> 01:07:59,671
Then you can go.

659
01:08:06,721 --> 01:08:07,747
Don't go.

660
01:08:23,962 --> 01:08:25,933
I need you alert.

661
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:29,036
Don't make me regret this.

662
01:08:38,899 --> 01:08:40,730
That was fun.

663
01:08:41,102 --> 01:08:45,146
Now let's go kill Castle and
his miserable whore.

664
01:08:45,146 --> 01:08:47,082
No, not yet.

665
01:08:47,284 --> 01:08:49,984
We're gonna have ourselves
a little fun with this.

666
01:08:50,157 --> 01:08:52,797
Next time he has to face us
and a fucking army.

667
01:08:52,797 --> 01:08:54,734
Where do we get the army from?

668
01:08:54,774 --> 01:08:57,908
Just like Uncle Sam, bro.

669
01:08:57,908 --> 01:09:00,815
We recruit in troubled neighborhoods.

670
01:09:00,815 --> 01:09:04,256
Offer a hundred grand towards
a college education they'll never get.

671
01:09:04,256 --> 01:09:07,197
Promise nobody ever has to
go to Iraq.

672
01:09:08,332 --> 01:09:10,570
Just as long as I get to kill Castle.

673
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:12,744
Don't worry brother. You will.

674
01:09:12,744 --> 01:09:15,948
Just making damn sure this time
he don't come back breathing.

675
01:10:00,521 --> 01:10:01,923
Hold it.

676
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:09,033
Hello sportsfans.

677
01:10:16,293 --> 01:10:18,531
How are you today my friend?

678
01:10:18,531 --> 01:10:20,369
Run! Get out of here!

679
01:10:20,369 --> 01:10:24,911
Hey! I axed you a question.
- Run!

680
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:28,753
You don't answer.

681
01:10:29,657 --> 01:10:32,723
Guess I'll have to ask it again.

682
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:36,002
Here I come.

683
01:11:17,805 --> 01:11:19,502
Good.

684
01:11:20,177 --> 01:11:21,271
Bring them upstairs.

685
01:11:21,613 --> 01:11:22,513
Meet me back down here.

686
01:11:23,385 --> 01:11:26,421
I'll see if we can talk a few
poor bastards into signing up.

687
01:11:34,844 --> 01:11:36,069
Where are they?

688
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:45,636
I shout. I swear I shout.

689
01:11:45,636 --> 01:11:48,700
Goddamnit! Don't die on me.

690
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:51,718
I'm bleeding out.

691
01:11:51,718 --> 01:11:53,287
I seen this shit before.

692
01:11:53,287 --> 01:11:55,725
Shut up kid. You're gonna be fine.

693
01:11:56,563 --> 01:11:58,930
It hurts real bad.
Hurts real bad, Frank.

694
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:03,812
Don't let me die like this, man.

695
01:12:03,812 --> 01:12:05,405
Not like this.

696
01:12:16,442 --> 01:12:17,741
See you in hell.

697
01:12:18,447 --> 01:12:22,218
I see you anywhere near hell,
I'll kick your ass out.

698
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,779
I haven't seen you in ages, Frank.

699
01:12:50,756 --> 01:12:53,422
Whatever it is, it must be pretty bad.

700
01:12:53,697 --> 01:12:55,755
Maybe I'm just here to see an old friend, Mike.

701
01:12:56,468 --> 01:12:58,139
Yeah right. I haven't seen you since-

702
01:12:58,229 --> 01:13:00,102
The funeral. I know.

703
01:13:02,517 --> 01:13:04,419
I've been reading about you.

704
01:13:04,688 --> 01:13:07,627
You've been a long way from
the seminary, my friend.

705
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:11,864
I don't even remember
that as part of my life.

706
01:13:12,473 --> 01:13:13,566
Why do you do this?

707
01:13:15,448 --> 01:13:17,378
Somebody has to punish the corrupt.

708
01:13:18,887 --> 01:13:21,495
For in the same way you judge others,
you will be judged.

709
01:13:21,495 --> 01:13:25,936
And with the measure you use,
it will be measured to you.

710
01:13:27,876 --> 01:13:29,243
Matthew. 72.

711
01:13:32,653 --> 01:13:33,313
I'm Ok with that.

712
01:13:35,427 --> 01:13:37,096
God be with you, Frank.

713
01:13:41,575 --> 01:13:47,552
Sometimes I'd like to get
my hands on God.

714
01:14:01,489 --> 01:14:03,119
Interesting choice for a meeting place.

715
01:14:03,493 --> 01:14:05,727
Didn't take you for a religious man,
Castle.

716
01:14:06,467 --> 01:14:09,597
Yeah well. An eye for an eye.

717
01:14:09,808 --> 01:14:12,940
If I remember right, they are
not called the Ten Suggestions.

718
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:16,182
Russoti's got Angela and Grace.

719
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:19,027
How?-
Doesn't matter.

720
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:21,833
Or maybe if you put her in protective
custody like you should've...

721
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:24,466
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

722
01:14:24,567 --> 01:14:26,166
They'd be dead.

723
01:14:26,814 --> 01:14:28,513
The law can't touch them, Castle.

724
01:14:29,721 --> 01:14:31,116
Total immunity.

725
01:14:31,393 --> 01:14:34,861
Unless you got a video tape of
Russoti taking them.

726
01:14:36,036 --> 01:14:37,733
Can't even give him a parking ticket.

727
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:40,373
It's a fucked up system you're
sworn to protect.

728
01:14:41,751 --> 01:14:42,810
I never said it was perfect.

729
01:14:43,953 --> 01:14:45,852
He wants me in
exchange for them.

730
01:14:46,961 --> 01:14:50,128
I need you to secure the trade.

731
01:14:50,769 --> 01:14:52,232
Ok.

732
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:54,981
But I'm doing this by the book.

733
01:14:54,981 --> 01:14:57,783
What book do you think
they're going by huh?

734
01:14:58,155 --> 01:14:59,989
I took an oath, Castle.

735
01:15:00,827 --> 01:15:03,087
There are laws.
-No official police procedure.

736
01:15:04,069 --> 01:15:04,935
You wanna come along?

737
01:15:06,106 --> 01:15:07,436
Leave your badge at home.

738
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,280
I have to think about it.

739
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:14,716
The clock's ticking.

740
01:15:37,415 --> 01:15:38,383
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

741
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,280
Relax.

742
01:15:40,955 --> 01:15:43,554
We're looking for a few good man.

743
01:15:45,766 --> 01:15:47,437
And we'd like to offer you
the opportunity...

744
01:15:47,437 --> 01:15:50,711
to be all that you can be.

745
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:53,884
Now we've all suffered loss,

746
01:15:53,912 --> 01:15:56,817
at the hands of the Punisher.

747
01:15:58,162 --> 01:16:01,169
And because we don't look like
everybody else,

748
01:16:01,269 --> 01:16:04,142
and because we don't act like
everybody else,

749
01:16:05,379 --> 01:16:07,541
nobody does a goddamn thing about it.

750
01:16:08,954 --> 01:16:13,831
Well I say, he ain't the only one who can
take the war into his own hands.

751
01:16:14,533 --> 01:16:19,913
So if you're as sick of this
cocksucker as I am,

752
01:16:19,913 --> 01:16:21,985
raise your armies.

753
01:16:21,985 --> 01:16:22,680
You'll be well paid.

754
01:16:24,926 --> 01:16:26,053
You'll be well armed.

755
01:16:27,899 --> 01:16:31,807
And at the end of it, the Punisher
will be dead.

756
01:17:49,825 --> 01:17:51,528
Agent Budiansky.

757
01:17:51,628 --> 01:17:52,696
Just in time for happy hour.

758
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:55,626
You need to come with me.

759
01:17:56,473 --> 01:17:57,334
Where to?

760
01:17:57,442 --> 01:17:58,775
Your partner, Frank Castle.

761
01:17:58,812 --> 01:18:00,544
He needs help.

762
01:18:02,554 --> 01:18:04,890
Partner is a little bit
of an exaggeration.

763
01:18:06,164 --> 01:18:07,224
How did you know?

764
01:18:07,732 --> 01:18:10,261
Usually unless you've arrested Houdini.

765
01:18:11,242 --> 01:18:13,303
A handcuffed criminal does
not escape that easily.

766
01:18:13,547 --> 01:18:15,244
You know you're not as stupid as you-

767
01:18:15,745 --> 01:18:16,945
I didn't say that.

768
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:21,799
Who are we looking for?

769
01:18:21,699 --> 01:18:22,895
Cristu's father.

770
01:18:25,376 --> 01:18:28,177
I don't think this is a good idea.

771
01:18:38,572 --> 01:18:39,734
What?

772
01:18:40,476 --> 01:18:42,145
We're looking for Tiberiu,
Cristu father.

773
01:18:46,224 --> 01:18:47,250
Why?

774
01:18:47,694 --> 01:18:48,529
If I were to Tiberiu,

775
01:18:48,529 --> 01:18:52,437
I'd probably wanna find the man who was
responsible for sending my son to prison,

776
01:18:53,173 --> 01:18:53,937
for the rest of his life.

777
01:18:55,179 --> 01:18:56,039
And how would you do that?

778
01:18:56,114 --> 01:18:58,417
I tell him when and where to find him.

779
01:18:58,887 --> 01:19:02,656
What do you want from me?

780
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:05,793
I don't like him.
I want him taken care of.

781
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:11,348
No worries my friend.

782
01:20:07,617 --> 01:20:08,817
Here they are.

783
01:20:09,018 --> 01:20:10,715
Oh boy!

784
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:47,664
Take it easy James.
He'll be here.

785
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:53,758
You get it.
- Fuck that, you get it!

786
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:55,855
I'll get it.

787
01:20:58,935 --> 01:20:59,870
What you looking for?

788
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:04,337
I'm here to see the Jigsaw.
- You out of luck. No Jigsaw here.

789
01:21:05,851 --> 01:21:08,850
I'm here, for the Punisher party.

790
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:22,288
Who is the old man?
That's Critu's father.

791
01:21:24,563 --> 01:21:26,866
Old country genocidal maniac.

792
01:21:26,866 --> 01:21:29,540
Figured he'd stir up a shitstorm for us.

793
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:32,981
Cops will be all over this place
once the fireworks start.

794
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:36,314
I wouldn't worry about that,
I called in a explosives permit.

795
01:21:37,793 --> 01:21:40,857
Consruction. Said we'd be
blasting dynamite all night

796
01:21:41,636 --> 01:21:44,577
So, what's the plan?

797
01:21:44,577 --> 01:21:46,274
I going in to get them.

798
01:21:49,053 --> 01:21:50,991
You call that a plan.

799
01:21:50,991 --> 01:21:52,188
It's all I've made.

800
01:21:54,567 --> 01:21:55,961
Well I'm going with you.

801
01:21:59,445 --> 01:22:03,219
I never took the time
to think about where I was headed.

802
01:22:03,219 --> 01:22:05,521
I'm far down that road.

803
01:22:07,463 --> 01:22:09,456
You're not going there.

804
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:12,807
Thanks Frank.

805
01:22:13,812 --> 01:22:15,441
You know he's going to take it
out on me when he wakes up.

806
01:22:16,819 --> 01:22:19,519
You don't hear gunfire for
longer than 5 minutes

807
01:22:21,731 --> 01:22:22,993
Then the girls are not here.

808
01:22:23,967 --> 01:22:24,627
Set him loose.

809
01:26:02,149 --> 01:26:02,739
It's time.

810
01:26:03,856 --> 01:26:05,649
James, be careful.

811
01:26:54,504 --> 01:26:55,597
Oh for fuck sake!

812
01:27:29,419 --> 01:27:32,223
You won't be replacing that
son of yours any time soon.

813
01:27:33,596 --> 01:27:36,293
Blood in the urine. Early
indicator of kidney failure.

814
01:27:41,747 --> 01:27:43,377
You should be seeing
double right about now.

815
01:27:46,659 --> 01:27:47,850
That would be a torn meniscus.

816
01:28:31,734 --> 01:28:32,323
James!

817
01:28:32,433 --> 01:28:34,028
Gun!

818
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:42,112
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

819
01:28:46,635 --> 01:28:48,663
Please help us!
-Shut the fuck up!

820
01:28:50,677 --> 01:28:52,341
C'mon Castle, don't be shy.

821
01:28:57,026 --> 01:28:58,153
Throw down your gun!

822
01:29:04,309 --> 01:29:08,217
Die you bastard.
-No, James

823
01:29:08,217 --> 01:29:12,056
That's no way to punish the Punisher.

824
01:29:31,005 --> 01:29:31,900
Nice shooter!

825
01:29:45,271 --> 01:29:49,984
Catch! Let's play a game.
What do you say?

826
01:29:50,084 --> 01:29:52,020
You got one round left in there.

827
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:56,755
You shoot one of these two
I'll let the other one go free.

828
01:29:57,666 --> 01:29:59,801
What do you say, Frank?

829
01:30:00,106 --> 01:30:02,738
Who's it to be,
your fat friend right here?

830
01:30:03,046 --> 01:30:04,572
Or that nice little piece
of jailbait over there?

831
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:06,749
Burn in hell!
-Ok

832
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:08,051
Then they both die.

833
01:30:09,161 --> 01:30:09,786
Frank!

834
01:30:10,731 --> 01:30:15,140
She's a kid. Shoot me.

835
01:30:32,182 --> 01:30:34,187
Ok, fuck it, kill her first!
-No!

836
01:30:34,187 --> 01:30:35,120
Stop!

837
01:30:38,128 --> 01:30:38,686
He's made a decision.

838
01:30:41,938 --> 01:30:44,809
Not looking too good for you, fatso

839
01:30:49,121 --> 01:30:51,116
You have to three, Castle!

840
01:30:51,317 --> 01:30:52,217
One

841
01:30:54,098 --> 01:30:54,934
Two

842
01:30:54,934 --> 01:31:00,209
You won't feel a thing my friend.

843
01:31:20,897 --> 01:31:21,261
God!

844
01:31:43,817 --> 01:31:45,445
Frank!

845
01:31:55,778 --> 01:31:56,676
Get out!

846
01:32:22,139 --> 01:32:23,302
Fuck you!

847
01:32:24,145 --> 01:32:24,804
Let me put you out of my misery!

848
01:32:32,497 --> 01:32:34,296
This is just the beginning!

849
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:01,288
You ok?

850
01:33:01,466 --> 01:33:02,624
Where is Castle?
-Still inside

851
01:33:03,571 --> 01:33:04,595
And Micro?

852
01:33:11,156 --> 01:33:12,455
Frank!
Are you ok?

853
01:33:21,512 --> 01:33:22,104
You better get out of here.

854
01:33:23,617 --> 01:33:25,146
Come on, Frank, I'll buy you a drink.

855
01:33:26,256 --> 01:33:27,520
Wait! Wait!

856
01:33:29,164 --> 01:33:33,904
My husband Nicky, we talked about you.

857
01:33:35,713 --> 01:33:36,943
Argued about you.

858
01:33:41,293 --> 01:33:42,419
He said you were one of the good guys.

859
01:34:28,703 --> 01:34:31,734
You know buddy?
Maybe it's time to quit now, huh?

860
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:35,650
I mean, you must get tired of this, right?

861
01:34:36,689 --> 01:34:38,562
I think you got all the criminals in town.

862
01:34:38,562 --> 01:34:41,260
If there are any left
at least consider rehabilitation.

863
01:34:44,742 --> 01:34:47,380
I mean contrary to popular
belief, people can change.

864
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:51,613
I guess what I'm saying is, I'm
just personally not a fan of the death penalty.

865
01:34:54,866 --> 01:34:55,526
Frank?

866
01:34:56,302 --> 01:34:59,008
Where did he go?

867
01:34:59,008 --> 01:35:02,244
Hey, give me your fucking
wallet motherfucker!

868
01:35:03,285 --> 01:35:06,726
You're kidding right?
Do I look like I'm fucking kidding?

869
01:35:07,498 --> 01:35:09,427
Frank!
- Give me your wallet!

870
01:35:11,002 --> 01:35:11,838
Frank?

871
01:35:11,838 --> 01:35:12,804
Do you wanna die?

872
01:35:15,883 --> 01:35:18,849
For the last time, give me your wallet!

873
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:25,750
Oh God. Now I've got
brains splattered all over me.
