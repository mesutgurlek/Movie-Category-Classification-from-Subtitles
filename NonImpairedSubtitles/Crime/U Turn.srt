1
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,000
HELL

2
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,600
- Like it?
- It's perfect

3
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,600
You have visitors

4
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,700
Are we in the way?

5
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,700
- Are you pleased?
- So far. Want to see?

6
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,600
- That's why we're here
- Follow your guide

7
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,100
Big, isn't it?

8
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,900
You haven't seen half of it.
That's to be my apartment

9
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,700
With two rooms for kids

10
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,400
There's a room almost ready here

11
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,900
It must be costing a packet

12
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,200
It's really comfortable

13
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,200
- I renewed all the bedding
- Where's the money coming from?

14
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Fifteen years of hard-earned savings,
plus what my mother left me

15
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,900
Most of it's thanks to my bank;
I'm in debt to here!

16
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,300
Got a light?

17
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,900
Next year I'll build a
landing-stage here

18
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,200
I'll buy you an electric razor

19
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,000
No, this is perfect

20
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,700
Come here, let me see

21
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,900
He's walking, Nelly, come and look

22
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,800
I know he's walking

23
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,700
The light... I'd rather it was off

24
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,400
Just a bad dream; I won't be long

25
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,500
- "What are you doing here?"
- The kid crying... I can't sleep

26
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,700
I'm sleeping very badly just now

27
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,900
- What are you doing here?
- What was up with him?

28
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Just a bad dream. Come to bed

29
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Coming to bed?

30
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,900
I think you've lost it

31
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,500
- I feel I won't get to sleep all night
- Yes, you will

32
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,300
I'll get a pill for you;
I'm good at that

33
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,300
You work too hard,
so you're over-tired

34
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,900
But you'll sleep with what I gave you

35
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,500
Put out the light

36
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,900
- Did you sleep well?
- Very well

37
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,700
Even my husband, who's so
susceptible to noise

38
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,400
Luckily the planes had a quiet night

39
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,900
That's not all I'm susceptible to

40
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,800
Waking here in the morning is pure joy

41
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,200
Then you must come again
during the season

42
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,900
My husband would really like it

43
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,700
With a month's notice, I can
see you get a good room

44
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The same one, if possible

45
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,300
He's put chocolate on your face

46
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,500
- A bit behind, aren't you?
- Vincent wanted chocolate

47
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,700
- You'll be late for school
- I'm always early

48
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,900
- You'll be right back?
- No, I've things to do

49
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,600
- For the hotel?
- No, for me

50
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,600
Clothilde will be in at ten
to finish the accounts

51
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,300
That's just a curtain-raiser

52
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Open wide, boy

53
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,600
Sleeping pills can backfire on you

54
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,100
Nothing serious this time

55
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,000
What did I tell you?

56
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,900
You can open the curtains, Nelly

57
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,200
He was imagining cancer of the throat

58
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,900
Right now he makes mountains out of
everything, for no reason

59
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,400
I don't do it for fun

60
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He can't relax, that's all

61
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,900
- Relaxing isn't the problem
- What is, then?

62
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,800
I don't know

63
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,900
Here's the prescription

64
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,900
Why not go with the doctor, get the
medicine and collect our car?

65
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,900
- Would you mind, Doctor?
- Not at all, if we go now

66
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,500
Leaving me without a kiss?

67
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,300
Monsieur and Madame Vernon!

68
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,900
We told you we'd come back

69
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,300
I had to juggle, but you've
the same room

70
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,900
Come and see the view, darling

71
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
Finished the letters?

72
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,900
No, I was seeing to the insurance
cards first

73
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,900
My wife didn't do that?

74
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,100
She was at the beach

75
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,600
I must get these X-rays to
Madame Point

76
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,900
Please tell that child to do
her aerobatics elsewhere

77
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,400
Your X-rays, Madame Point

78
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,500
Madame Point wants you to
play elsewhere

79
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,900
- Where can I go?
- Try the tarred road, that's smooth

80
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,200
- Have you tried skating on it?
- Yes, well, go on anyway

81
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,400
- Life's too short for abstinence
- I don't abstain

82
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,300
Two cognacs, Julien

83
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,100
And one for the boss

84
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,200
- A drink, Doctor?
- Never on duty, like the cops

85
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,700
Nothing for me, then

86
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm going to town; is my car ready?

87
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,900
I'm having the weekend off

88
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
- When did Dad say it would be ready?
- Yesterday

89
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,300
So it's ready; you can trust him

90
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,700
The baby's all right?
So Nelly can join us

91
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,100
No, she should stay with him

92
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,900
We were expecting her to join us

93
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
It was great this morning

94
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,100
Another time, all right?

95
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,600
Watch out: That's what
having kids means

96
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
I'Iljust go and see her

97
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,900
She's busy; go and enjoy yourself

98
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,700
- You're pretty curt with your guests
- She's a friend

99
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,900
I hope she knows that

100
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,300
Vincent's not really ill?

101
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,800
It's your pills that worry me

102
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,900
- I need them to sleep
- Well, just watch it

103
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,000
Not overdoing your drinking?

104
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,200
In this business you can't
always refuse

105
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
You've got problems?

106
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,500
Money problems, I mean.
How's business?

107
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,500
As good as can be expected

108
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,100
I'm not ill, Doctor

109
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Are your competitors hurting you?

110
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,100
They're amateurs

111
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
But doing well?

112
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,900
Well, it's easy to sweeten the coach-
drivers and serve the customers shit

113
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,900
You sweat blood for years,
setting up a decent business...

114
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,700
...and some ponce muscles in

115
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,200
Where's the justice in that?

116
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,900
You waste no time, Monsieur Duhamel!

117
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,600
It's the magic hour, Monsieur Prieur

118
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,200
Things are already starting to change

119
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,000
- Haven't you a camcorder?
- Never, Monsieur Prieur

120
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,300
Big screen cinema, that's the thing

121
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,300
- What's new?
- The Duchemins called, hopping mad

122
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,100
They should have booked earlier.
I'll write to them

123
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,200
But the Mayor of Villeneuve's
daughter's wedding is on Saturday

124
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,300
- Did my wife speak to him?
- No, I rang her but got no reply

125
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
She'll have been with Vincent

126
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,200
No, Julie was looking after him

127
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,900
Never mind... I'll take the medicine up

128
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,200
Paul... what's up?

129
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,000
He was showing me his slides

130
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,400
In the dark?

131
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,300
Yes, they show up better

132
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,700
Did you get the medicine?

133
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,300
Do you know the time? You should be
in the dining-room

134
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,200
Already?

135
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,100
Did you get your car?

136
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,600
Yes, of course

137
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,900
- Out for a bit of air, Monsieur Paul?
- Lovely day, isn't it?

138
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,400
{y:i}Now you know where you are

139
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,800
She didn't look guilty

140
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,100
{y:i}No, she didn't. Do you find that
{y:i}reassuring?

141
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,300
But in the lounge... she's not a fool

142
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,200
"No," she "isn't"

143
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,200
Is the menu to your liking?

144
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,600
No meat at night for me.
May I have an omelette?

145
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,800
- Of course. With ham, herbs, cheese?
- No, just eggs

146
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,600
- We searched everywhere for you
- I went for a walk, didn't feel well

147
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,500
What's wrong?

148
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,200
Just tired; I feel better now

149
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,100
More moonshine!

150
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:01,200
- Let me carry your things
- No, let me. I was extravagant today

151
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,800
It's the privilege of pretty women
to ruin us

152
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,200
You look better, my pet.
Have you been good?

153
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Angelic

154
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,500
Here's a good cure

155
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,200
What do you say?

156
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Don't ask too much of him

157
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,500
This is yours

158
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,800
- I'll bet it's a nightdress
- See-through!

159
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Thanks for keeping me company

160
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,900
It was a pleasure; think of me
the next time you go

161
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,600
Aren't you putting it on a bit?

162
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,900
He likes to play the gallant.
Where's the harm?

163
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,900
Bathtime, you

164
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,700
No more sore throat?

165
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,400
Give me your other foot

166
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,700
- Did you pay the printer?
- Yes, I went just after lunch

167
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,600
He called at three, wanting his money

168
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,800
I must have arrived just after

169
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,200
You stayed at mother's till three?

170
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,900
Of course not

171
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,200
Weren't you lunching with her?

172
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,500
It's too hot for that

173
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,400
Weren't you lunching with her?

174
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,600
She had a new pupil

175
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,100
Endless scales... so I ate
at the shop with Marilyn

176
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,900
You be a big boy and ask Clothilde
or Marie to cook you something

177
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,200
How about a kiss for daddy?

178
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,800
I feel like a shower. How about you?

179
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,900
What did the customers do
while you ate in the shop?

180
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,700
Nobody turned up

181
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,500
Until three o'clock?

182
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,900
I don't spend my time watching clocks

183
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Now hold on...

184
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,300
Let me have a look

185
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,400
Come into the light

186
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,000
- I don't believe it
- What?

187
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,900
You're jealous

188
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,700
I'm so glad; it proves
you care for me

189
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,900
I'll be catching cold

190
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,400
Don't mind me

191
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,600
Sorry, it was pure curiosity

192
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,300
- Nice, isn't it?
- Must have cost a packet, though

193
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Guess

194
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,300
5,000 francs

195
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,300
Where would I get that much?
Dry me, instead of talking nonsense

196
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,700
- What "did" it cost?
- You never let an idea go, do you?

197
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,300
1,500 francs. Surprised?

198
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,300
You bet I'm surprised

199
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,900
Old Montignac took some beating down

200
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,600
- There's mail?
- A letter from my brother

201
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,400
- Where is he right now?
- In Germany, at Koblenz

202
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,900
I'll take the stamp to my dressmaker
for her son

203
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,200
- Where are you going?
- My mother's

204
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,600
- Again?
- To help. I told you she wasn't well

205
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,700
You told me that?

206
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,800
The doctor's right; you're not well

207
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,600
My bus! Call and say I'm coming

208
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
My wife's just coming

209
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,500
{y:i}Alibi

210
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,800
Don't do it, watch out

211
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,400
Don't do it, watch out for yourself

212
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,400
{y:i}Now, if she's not ather mother's,
{y:i}you'll know

213
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,100
She's out, giving a lesson in town

214
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,700
Daydreaming as usual

215
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,000
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for mother

216
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,400
- I thought she wasn't well
- You know that doesn't stop her

217
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,300
Why are you here? Is Vincent ill?

218
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,900
No, I was just passing

219
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Why?

220
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,400
I was at the Hoteliers' Association

221
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:11,300
I don't want to seem picky, but
that's across town. Where's the car?

222
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,700
Place Jeanne d'Arc

223
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,200
The bus terminal

224
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,300
Could you be following me?

225
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,600
Have I any reason to?

226
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,200
No, but I could arrange it if you like

227
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,600
This is silly; let's drop it

228
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,300
Say something nice

229
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,200
- Is your brother still liking Germany?
- He sends his love

230
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,300
What else? Treat me to some of
his deathless prose

231
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,600
How stupid... Mum has it

232
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,900
She was out

233
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,800
- I put it through her letter-box
- You think fast... like the handbag

234
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,200
It cost 4,000 francs.
I called Montignac

235
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,400
Such trust you have

236
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,200
The fact is, I won on the horses

237
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,600
You gamble?

238
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,900
From time to time

239
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,200
Why didn't you tell me?

240
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,500
You'd have blamed Marilyn

241
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,700
Where did you place the bet?

242
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,200
The café across the bridge

243
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,300
They're closed this week

244
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,700
Granny died. Water's leaking, too

245
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,700
Is that you, Paul?

246
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:35,200
It's all finished, nothing left.
I'm closing

247
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,900
What's wrong, Paul?

248
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,600
Are you ill? An accident?

249
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,600
Answer me... say something

250
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,900
Where have you been?

251
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,900
You scare me, just standing there

252
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,900
Can I help?

253
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,900
Do you want to be on your own?

254
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,000
What is it, Paul?

255
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:13,200
We looked everywhere for you,
on the road, by the lake...

256
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,900
...in town, the police station,
the hospital

257
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,200
I was hanging on to the phone

258
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,200
Weeping like a fountain

259
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,100
All our guests looked, found nothing...

260
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,900
I couldn't bear to see them return

261
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,600
Then night fell...

262
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,900
You're here, you're here!

263
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,900
My poor Nelly. I saw you and
Martineau, on the river

264
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,600
What of it?

265
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,500
Please, I don't want to talk about it.
I followed you, isn't that enough?

266
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,900
When you landed, was it to play cards?

267
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,700
I saw you... I "saw" you

268
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:41,900
Saw what? Is that why you
ran off like a maniac?

269
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,300
Why I've been shaking all day,
and you're in this state?

270
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,900
Yes, we landed on the island...

271
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
...because I needed a rest

272
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,900
Lying on the grass

273
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,600
No, standing on one leg!

274
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Look at me, you fool!

275
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,800
Can't you see I love you,
that I'm your wife?

276
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:16,700
Look at my eyes... it's for you
I've been crying

277
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,800
What if he doesn't come back,
I thought. Without him I'm nothing

278
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,700
No, you don't love me any more.
Leave me alone

279
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,900
If I didn't love you,
I wouldn't be here

280
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,900
I wanted to die, too...
do you hear me?

281
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,200
It hurts so

282
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,600
Hush, it's all over now.
I'm here and I love you

283
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,100
Come on, darling

284
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,500
What are you dreaming?

285
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,500
No, it's over... it's all over

286
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,500
- Back already?
- I haven't time to waste

287
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,200
- Can I christen it?
- Of course

288
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,700
It must have cost

289
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,300
I'll go and change

290
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,900
Sorry, the weekends are fully booked

291
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:16,700
No. 4 is free. Martineau phoned
to cancel

292
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,600
These shirts won't last another winter

293
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,100
It's full of holes

294
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,600
When did Martineau call?

295
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,200
I said that for Clothilde's sake.
"I" called "him"

296
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,200
I told him not to come back, right?

297
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,900
This pillowcase has had it

298
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,700
I said he was nice, but
too full of himself

299
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,900
He got the point, all right

300
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:10,000
What will people think,
you calling him?

301
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,800
That I'm scared and leave
the dirty work...

302
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,600
...to you?

303
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,800
I couldn't let you suffer

304
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,600
So you make me a laughing-stock?

305
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,000
Martineau's got himself snagged,
for once

306
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,500
He won't say a word

307
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,500
That's what you think

308
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,600
So your love depends on
what people think?

309
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,200
Keep your jewels

310
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,600
Help me

311
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,500
Don't... I was wrong

312
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,600
It won't come off, anyway

313
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,900
Who said you could take my doll?

314
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,200
- You're mean
- You're the nasty one

315
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,900
Your boy's a poet, says it's a train

316
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,900
- What's wrong?
- He took my doll

317
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,900
Children squabbling over their toys?

318
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,200
Just hold it, right there

319
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,500
It's my doll

320
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,900
Couldn't you lend it?

321
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,600
What a pest

322
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,100
It's the magic hour, Monsieur Prieur

323
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,300
Sorry, I've work to do

324
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,500
Where's he off to?

325
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,400
He's so busy, Monsieur Duhamel

326
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,400
Lights, please!

327
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,500
I'll only be a second

328
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,300
Choc-ices, caramels...

329
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,400
Is there much more?

330
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,700
It's the last reel

331
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,200
Look at that zoom!

332
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,500
Pity Martineau's not here

333
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,200
I filmed his garage

334
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,500
A real star turn

335
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,900
You ought to be in films

336
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,400
- That's you!
- Yes, the day mother was ill

337
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,900
Less than I wanted...

338
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,400
...but I couldn't follow them

339
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,000
{y:i}Have the courage to face the truth

340
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,400
A narrow squeak, my love

341
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,200
You can't come again,
he's watching me

342
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,900
I'll spin a yarn and
we can meet in town

343
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,900
Yes, I'll alert Marilyn

344
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,900
Stop it... yes, of course I want to...

345
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,700
Stop it, for God's sake!

346
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,100
What's got into you?

347
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,600
Don't worry, he'll get over it

348
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:21,500
Forgive me... forgive me

349
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,000
Proud of yourself?

350
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,200
What will people think?
You don't care, do you?

351
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,900
Duhamel wanted to leave.
He's staying, but not for you

352
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,500
I told him you'd been drinking

353
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,800
Am I entitled to an explanation?

354
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,900
Talk to me, Paul

355
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,600
I'm jealous

356
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,900
Jealous of whom? Of what?

357
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:41,900
I don't know, but it's killing me

358
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,300
It's killing me

359
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,200
I almost jumped from the window

360
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,900
I can't bear to see you like this,
Paul. Hit me if you want

361
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,900
I'd prefer that

362
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:23,300
But it's inside me, I know that

363
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,900
You're exhausted, my love,
come and get some sleep

364
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,300
You think I can sleep?

365
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,200
Just relax... let yourself go

366
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,200
Have you seen Martineau again?

367
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,300
Oh really, Paul, I was asleep

368
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,600
Have you seen him again?

369
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,600
No, because I called to say
not to come again

370
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,600
Because it's dangerous here

371
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,900
So you see him in town.
That's logical, isn't it?

372
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:58,900
Yes, it's logical, but it's untrue

373
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,900
Can you prove it?

374
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,500
How can I?

375
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:20,400
If you won't be reasonable,
let me do it for both of us

376
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,500
It bothers you if I go into town?
Then I won't. Ever

377
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,900
Not ever?

378
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,900
Not ever

379
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,900
Feel better now?

380
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,200
Sort of

381
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,400
- What more can I do?
- It's too late; what's done is done

382
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,600
But what did I do?

383
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,500
You can ask after your island trip?

384
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,200
Not that again. I told you
I was tired and had to rest

385
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,800
- Aren't you drinking too much?
- I'm cold

386
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,200
- I'm cold, too
- You want some?

387
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:40,000
So you had a rest?

388
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,900
- For half-an-hour?
- No, for five minutes

389
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:50,400
Wrong. You left at 11.30,
I arrived on the stroke of midday

390
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,200
Listen...

391
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,700
One last time. We left at 11.30...

392
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:04,600
...and had a rest on the island...

393
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:09,500
...that's true, but it was
because I was tired

394
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:14,500
- So you lay down in the grass
- I did not lie down in the grass

395
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,200
You're lying

396
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:26,900
I'm sick of your lies. Come on,
you're going to tell me the truth

397
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:30,500
All right, so I slept with Martineau...

398
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:36,200
...on the island, in his car, at his
place, on our bed. Now are you happy?

399
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,900
Open up

400
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,100
I was wrong

401
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:05,700
I'm past that now... I love you

402
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,100
Don't be silly... let me in

403
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,700
Idiot

404
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,500
Got my lambs, boss?

405
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:52,900
I left them at the butcher's. I'll
call him... my head's like a sieve

406
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,600
I'm so sorry

407
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,900
You're leaving? Nothing wrong
at home, I hope

408
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:08,900
Wrong here, I'd say, with
that row last night

409
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,900
Take their luggage to their car

410
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:26,600
Anyone can drink too much, but
with a sweet girl like that...

411
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,300
Good morning, all

412
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,900
- How are you, Nelly dear?
- Fine, thanks

413
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,600
I doubt if you slept well

414
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,600
That happens

415
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:02,200
- Stop it
- I'm an aeroplane

416
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,400
Vincent, please, I've a headache

417
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,400
Make me some bread-and-butter, Dad

418
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,600
Bread-and-butter

419
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,600
Can you take him to his grandmother
later?

420
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:24,700
Who, me?

421
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,800
Since I can't go out

422
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:48,600
- Have what you like... on the house
- How nice and how unusual

423
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:01,700
- Going for a walk?
- Is getting a breath of air forbidden?

424
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,200
I can't see Mum or Marilyn,
or take my son out

425
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:13,200
For two weeks you've kept
an eye on me

426
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,200
No, I can't take it any more

427
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,900
You want to pick a fight with me,
well, I'll give you cause

428
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:27,300
I don't know how or who with,
but I will

429
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:22,500
Are you saving on lights?
It'll be our pensions next

430
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,900
- The fuses?
- No, it's the region

431
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:31,600
It was the same during the last storm

432
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,800
- Have a drink with us, boss
- Thanks, but I must see to this

433
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:41,600
It's really no joke... it's been
like this for an hour

434
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,200
- What do they say?
- The number's still engaged

435
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:54,500
Trust French workers to strike

436
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,600
No, it's a power cut

437
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,700
- Seen my wife?
- Not for a while

438
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,200
Thirty-five minutes I've been
calling you

439
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,700
I know you're busy, but...

440
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,000
Isn't Mum here?

441
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,300
I don't know

442
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:22,400
As you see, just us menfolk

443
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:26,000
Mama's gone, vanished into the night

444
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,200
Move over, I'll play you something

445
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,600
It's good news... I hope

446
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,900
They say it won't be long now

447
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,900
Vanished into the night...
providential night

448
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,200
- Won't you come in?
- Is this really the moment?

449
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,300
- You're always so rushed
- Yes, I'm always rushed

450
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,900
- About time, too
- Sorry, I can't be everywhere

451
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,700
Is my husband coming soon?

452
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,800
I saw you sniggering together

453
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:42,300
He didn't say

454
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:04,600
- Oh, sorry, sir!
- What's wrong?

455
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,500
It's our customers...
they have wandering hands

456
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,300
- You startled me
- What were you doing in there?

457
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:23,900
A candle for the new guest, the
captain. What a night to arrive

458
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,400
- Why did you go in?
- He asked me to

459
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,900
- You didn't with the others
- Yes, but he was in bed

460
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,900
I wasn't to know. It's no better,
is it?

461
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:36,900
- What was he doing in bed?
- Waiting for me

462
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,300
Isn't it over, Paul?

463
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,900
You're right, it's stupid

464
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,300
I love you

465
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,200
You'd better hurry, Monsieur Chabert

466
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,400
- Your wife will be grumbling
- I'm used to that

467
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,600
Clothilde, send Vincent up for supper

468
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:23,900
You've got candle grease on
your skirt... on the back

469
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,300
I must have done that in the cellar

470
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,900
- You went to the cellar?
- Yes, to check the fuses

471
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,900
- Julien said he did that
- We had the same idea

472
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:26,300
- Now my ceiling's wet. What a country!
- The idiots didn't close the skylights

473
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,000
{y:i}They're all after her

474
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,900
Were you in the loft today?

475
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,400
No, why?

476
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,200
You're lying

477
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:34,200
Think carefully: Were you
in the loft today?

478
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,500
Oh yes, looking for lamps

479
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,200
- Alone
- Yes, alone

480
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,200
You're lying. Where's your bracelet?

481
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,900
- What bracelet?
- The one I gave you

482
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,100
- Lost
- When?

483
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,500
I don't know, a day or two ago

484
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:55,500
Liar

485
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:59,800
You're lying. I found it in the loft

486
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,900
Where is it?

487
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,600
- You're pathetic
- Be quiet

488
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,900
Every time you open your mouth
you lie

489
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:19,300
Yes, I lie, because I'm
sick of your scenes...

490
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,200
...worrying what to say
or not to say

491
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,700
Don't touch me

492
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,400
I'll say anything to end
your questions

493
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:33,400
Yes, I lie and I couldn't care less

494
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,800
You hate me? Go on, say you hate me

495
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:46,000
If I had money enough for Vincent
and my mother, I'd leave you

496
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:51,100
I can't believe that.
Is that why you stayed?

497
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,700
Why do you think I married you?

498
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,300
I don't believe that...
I can't believe you there

499
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,100
I'm sorry, but I'm all out.
Go to sleep

500
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,600
Yes, it's Paul

501
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:03,000
- Congratulations, the bird has flown
- What bird?

502
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,300
What on earth has got into you?

503
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:14,400
You're rich, so you can screw
the innkeeper's wife?

504
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:18,800
Try to calm down. Where is your wife?

505
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:22,600
You're asking me? What's "that," then?

506
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:28,600
That's nothing, just Lenoir...

507
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:37,100
...joining me for a game of cards
after dinner. Be serious, man

508
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:41,000
Don't make a joke of it

509
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:46,900
You've all taken advantage of me long
enough. Tomorrow: Everyone out!

510
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,200
You're really beginning to
get up my nose

511
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:59,700
First thing tomorrow I'm off,
and I won't be back

512
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,600
Now get out

513
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:12,700
If I ever kill myself,
it'll be on your conscience

514
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:20,900
Paul, don't play the fool

515
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,900
Be reasonable

516
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,800
Where have you been?

517
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,900
Me? Where have "you" been?

518
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:37,100
I was letting the cat in

519
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,400
Seeing Duhamel on the way

520
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,400
I know; I was there just now

521
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,900
You're crazy, Paul

522
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:50,600
You want every last one of them,
don't you? Old, young, employees

523
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:59,900
I have my rights, I'm going to
exercise them now

524
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:28,300
Stop it, Paul, please

525
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,400
{y:i}Forget the sweet talk

526
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,600
{y:i}Don'tlisten to the tart

527
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,400
Bitch!

528
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,900
I know she came here because she left
this on my pillow. You're hiding her

529
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:07,200
Sit down

530
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,900
You could be held responsible
for her desertion

531
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:16,600
I could have you charged

532
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,000
Come and sit down

533
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:33,200
I mustn't be angry, but if she
leaves me I have nothing

534
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,700
I can't live without her

535
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,400
Stay calm

536
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:42,200
Please give her back, Doctor

537
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:52,700
Come, Nelly, don't be afraid

538
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:58,400
What do I owe you for your labours?

539
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,000
Stop joking. You hurt Nelly...

540
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,300
...and I had to examine her

541
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,200
You've had your fill, I see

542
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:09,100
Go on like this and I'll
have you locked up

543
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:15,300
She's sick and I get locked up.
That's a good one

544
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:22,600
Don't get the idea that
I'll take this lying down

545
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:27,500
You may not think so,
but I know my rights

546
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,300
Arbitrary sequestration,
that's not on

547
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:31,800
Do you get me?

548
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:36,900
Don't you realize she's lying
to both of us?

549
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,100
She's a born liar

550
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:40,900
You beat her, Paul

551
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:45,100
I slapped her once in
six years of marriage

552
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:49,200
She asked for it,
and I'll do it again

553
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,200
You nearly maimed her

554
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:58,200
You have no idea what I went through

555
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,900
At first I believed her,
but then realized...

556
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,800
...and forgave her

557
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
But getting out of bed to meet lovers
in the attic, that's unforgiveable

558
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,900
What is one supposed to do?

559
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,900
It took me a long time to catch her,
because she's cunning

560
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,400
She'd pretend to sleep...

561
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:32,900
...but I'd programme myself
to wake up

562
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:37,300
Her feet would feel frozen

563
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,200
Proof she'd been up, see?

564
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,300
But, Doctor...

565
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,900
Quiet, let him talk;
this is interesting

566
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,900
It's not her fault. She loves me
in her way

567
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,900
But when the fit takes her,
it's anywhere and with anyone

568
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,600
She is sick

569
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:06,900
Just look at her... it's
undermining her health

570
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,500
It's hysteria

571
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:16,300
She's hysterical

572
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:23,600
Maybe you find this hard to believe?

573
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,900
No, I believe you, Paul

574
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:31,300
But it's monstrous... he is mad

575
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:39,100
There's your proof: Now she
wants me locked up

576
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:42,500
Yes, this demands immediate attention

577
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,700
See? What did I tell you?

578
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:55,600
- I'm calling the clinic
- Clinic? What for?

579
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,900
She needs a psychiatrist

580
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:04,000
Dumesnil? Arnoux here. I've a case
for you, same as last week

581
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:07,800
The husband's told me
a very revealing story

582
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:11,000
You understand? Yes, it's urgent

583
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,400
Really urgent

584
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:19,200
I'll bring them both tomorrow

585
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:26,600
Neither of us is going to any clinic

586
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,900
It's tough, Nelly, but
there's no other way

587
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,600
I'll protect you, Nelly.
They can't force us

588
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,500
I'll call for you,
seven tomorrow morning

589
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,200
I'll set the alarm for six

590
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,300
If it makes you happy

591
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,300
It doesn't, but we're getting up early

592
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,900
Look at this

593
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,600
Maybe I could give you another chance

594
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,100
I forgive you

595
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,400
It'll be like before

596
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,500
But be careful

597
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:26,400
I'll be severe; any lapse
and you're under lock and key

598
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,700
Can I have two sleeping pills?

599
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,300
Sleeping pills? Why two?

600
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:39,200
I need sleep. So do you

601
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:42,400
I need advice from no one

602
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,400
Do as you like, then

603
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:07,700
He told you not to upset me?

604
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,500
- Who?
- Arnoux

605
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:15,900
No, I've been here since
this afternoon

606
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:18,400
You could have telephoned

607
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:24,900
You can ask Clothilde if you like.
Come on, let's wake her

608
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,400
It was I who locked it

609
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,300
Do you mind?

610
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:39,600
Mind if I take precautions?

611
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:45,900
In case you start prowling
the bedrooms again

612
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:52,700
I know what your game is,
begging me to go to sleep

613
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:59,700
Listen, Paul... Vincent is feverish,
I must go to him

614
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,900
Will you let me out?

615
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,000
I'll give you two minutes

616
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,300
Give me the key now

617
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:22,800
The key, or I'll yell

618
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,700
One step and I yell for help

619
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,900
Haven't you caused enough trouble?

620
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,500
Give it to me

621
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,800
Poor Nelly, Arnoux was right

622
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,900
You're not normal

623
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:37,900
I'm waiting

624
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,600
Well played!

625
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,600
We'll see about this

626
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:18,900
You should trust me.
I wasn't long, was I?

627
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,300
Want to know about Vincent?

628
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:25,500
- Is Vincent all right?
- Yes, Vincent is all right

629
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:29,400
Don't sulk. Can I have the key back?

630
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,900
Listen, I'm tired

631
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:36,600
So you won't mind me locking up.
I'd feel safer

632
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:42,900
- Didn't I take my sleeping pills?
- Seems not. Can I have it back?

633
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,300
The key!

634
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:53,900
All right, I'll sleep in the armchair,
in front of the door

635
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,100
That'll leave you fresh
for leaving early

636
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,600
I won't be going

637
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:03,900
- You're leaving me to go alone?
- Don't worry, you're not going either

638
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:08,000
- But if I'm ill...
- Home remedies suit your illness best

639
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:11,400
A good beating will do it

640
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:16,000
You can enjoy stripping off
for the doctors next time

641
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:18,200
Arnoux can lump it

642
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,800
You can tell him tomorrow

643
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:22,900
No, because I won't be seeing him

644
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,900
Telephone's confiscated

645
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,600
- Are you scared?
- I'm not scared

646
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:40,200
I'm neither mad nor a monster;
get that into your head

647
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,200
I know, Paul

648
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,300
Then why try to call a doctor
at this hour?

649
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:48,200
I can't take any more

650
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,300
A great fiddle, that clinic

651
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,900
I'm talking to you.
Did you think I'd go?

652
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,400
Fell for it, didn't you? But
you won't get me; I'll fight

653
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:07,900
First, give me that key. Where is
that key, for God's sake?

654
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:14,900
Where is that key, for God's sake?

655
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
In the corridor, under the statuette

656
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:23,900
{y:i}She's been telling fibs

657
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:44,300
"Doctor"... "they're here. He's shut us"
{y:i}in, the key's under the carpet

658
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,900
{y:i}He's mad. I'll let them in
{y:i}when he falls asleep

659
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:02,400
{y:i}Wild beasts should be trussed

660
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,200
So you want to let them in?

661
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,500
You asked for it, slut!

662
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,700
{y:i}Doctor? He's tied me up. Come quickly
{y:i}and break the door down

663
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:41,900
My poor darling

664
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:51,900
Wake up, my love. It's six o'clock...
do you hear?

665
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:54,200
I'm so sleepy

666
01:31:56,700 --> 01:32:01,900
You can sleep in the car. We can't
waste any more time. Come on, baby

667
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,300
Open your eyes. Arnoux will be
here soon

668
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:10,300
What happened?

669
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,400
Nothing. Come on

670
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:15,200
It's dark. I'm scared when it rains

671
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:24,600
Yes, it's raining, but don't worry,
I'll drive carefully. We must hurry

672
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:30,900
Wipe your face, it'll waken you up.
I'll run a bath for you

673
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,900
Get a move on, my love

674
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:48,900
Don't push me, let me get used to it

675
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:01,200
Why are you looking at me as if
you'd never seen me before?

676
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:07,200
I haven't, not like today.
It's been so long, like a dream

677
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:10,400
If only that were true

678
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:12,300
It is true

679
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,200
Isn't it obvious?

680
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:20,200
It's been so long... I thought
everything was lost

681
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:25,000
There's nothing to cry about

682
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:29,300
I'm not... I'm happy and
I'm not crying

683
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,800
We'll start all over again

684
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:38,600
- Wait till I get back from Clermont
- You really want to go now?

685
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,700
You bet, as soon as possible

686
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,200
It's true, Paul

687
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:45,900
I can't wait to be safe

688
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,900
{y:i}Your wound has reopened

689
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,200
"Look"...

690
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,900
But I'd untied her

691
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:52,700
What's happening to me?

692
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:05,900
We were on the point of leaving
for the clinic at Clermont...

693
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,100
...both of us

694
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,900
But we're still here

695
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,900
It's like before

696
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,500
Like before what?

697
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:28,200
I no longer know... I'm lost

698
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:33,400
I only hope she isn't thinking of...

699
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,900
I must get my ideas straight...

700
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:47,900
Must be careful... mustn't...

701
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:51,400
...if I should ever...

702
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:02,200
Let me see...

703
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,200
WITHOUT END
