1
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,833
Don't touch it!

2
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,958
Are you free?

3
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:39,458
You are a good-looking man, but
my heart belongs to someone other.

4
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,792
Can l change the situation?

5
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:44,750
Oh! You enter into my feelings.

6
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,667
ls someone chasing you?

7
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,792
No. l just need transport to the
airport. Can you get there in 20
minutes?

8
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:53,833
20 minutes? l'll have the time
to finish my sandwich. Get in.

9
00:03:57,792 --> 00:04:00,917
Just some settings...

10
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,458
...and we'll discuss the news.

11
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,792
What about some music?

12
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,958
Ok, just start!

13
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,458
Ready: Start!

14
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,875
Marseille is a nice city.

15
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:04,542
And this is the right season.
- Yes, lucky me.

16
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,542
We are late. l have to accelerate.

17
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,417
- Put on your seatbelt please.
l'll switch to speed three.
- No problems.

18
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,042
- Are you OK?
- l'm fine.

19
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,708
- Was it Daniel?
- Who else. The prefect's mother?

20
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:53,833
He's fast. The cops cannot catch him!

21
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,833
Don't be so sure. They have received
a new arm.

22
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,833
A new arm? What kind of arm?

23
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,042
A secret one.

24
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:21,750
Damn it! 298 km/h!

25
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,667
Attention!
A white cab driving with 298 km/h.

26
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,542
l repeat: 298 km/h.

27
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:29,583
Understood, we are on the way.

28
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,792
Oh, l was worried, l thought
they were asleep.

29
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:47,792
- But this is a police car.
- No! Some friends of mine.

30
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:50,083
Very funny guys.

31
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:54,875
- Bertran, this is a strange registration.
- Get near.

32
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:02,917
''Go suckers, go!''
This is not a registration!
This is an e-mail...

33
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,958
Game over! Hold on.

34
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:22,458
Why are you stopping?
l am not stopping, he is
accelerating...

35
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,458
- Nitro?
- No, a friend of mine has a bar,

36
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,333
this is some kind of drink.
lfyou are interested, l'll

37
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,458
take some for you.

38
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:34,333
Thanks for the kindness.

39
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,125
Wait a bit, is this a TGV?

40
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,875
Yes. lt's a fast machine...

41
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,875
...but in this region it slows down.
- Mamma mia!

42
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,792
Where do you want to get out?

43
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:09,750
Here! Stop just here.

44
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,417
19 minutes 32 seconds.

45
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,833
Are you OK. Usually the passengers
are OK until l drive.

46
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,417
They throw up when l stop.
There is a bag, you can use it.

47
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,208
Thanks!

48
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,458
- Are you sure that this is the
right place
- Absolutely.

49
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,125
ls this your plane?!?

50
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,083
Thanks for the collaboration.

51
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,833
Have we met before?

52
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,667
l don't think so, but if l see
you again, l'll remember!

53
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:54,125
Good luck!

54
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:03,083
Lily never won't believe me.

55
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,208
What's happening?

56
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,292
Nothing. l had a nightmare.
Go back to sleep darling.

57
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,625
What the hell are you doing?

58
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,875
Nothing, l just couldn't sleep for
8 months.

59
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,458
Because ofthat gang?

60
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:49,375
Yes. Since 8 months they kid me.
l am losing my mind.

61
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,875
l see that. Since 8 months l
try to talk to you.

62
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,708
Yes, yes, but l have my own
problems.

63
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:57,875
- Did you hear me?
- Of course l did.

64
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:02,917
37 robberies for 8 months,
made by robbers, dressed like
Santa Claus. Can you imaginethat?

65
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:05,917
Yes, and now you don't believe
in Santa Clause.

66
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:09,875
l believe! No, l don't believe,
but it's not the problem.

67
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,875
Christmas comes, and the investigations
do not progress.

68
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,875
May be you feel the Christmas humour!

69
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,792
Petra, l have to catch that gang
before Christmas.

70
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,917
And me Emilian, l have to talk to
you before Christmas.

71
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:22,875
OK, we'll talk.

72
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:26,208
- What are you doing?
- l am going to the office.

73
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,417
But it's 3 o'clock in the morning!

74
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:34,875
That's ok. l'll avoid the
traffic.

75
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,667
- You are out ofyour mind!
- l am fine.

76
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,708
l'll see you in the office.

77
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,042
Wake up every one!

78
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:35,917
- Lily, honey! You can't sleep?
- l can't, because my boy friend
repairs his car at 4 o'clock in themorning.

79
00:13:35,917 --> 00:13:38,333
There is nothing broken.
lt's winter.

80
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:41,875
l am making some modifications
to be stable on the road.

81
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:46,958
Listen to me! You have 5 minutes
to do something with the heating.
l am cold, because l am alonein the bed.

82
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,917
And ifyou want to know, you do
this all the seasons.

83
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,917
- Don't say that Lily...
- Don't touch me!

84
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,875
lt's not so easy...

85
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,875
You use me like a rag.

86
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,667
What do you mean?

87
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:03,917
You use me like something, which
cleans plates and pots. l am so
stupid.

88
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:06,875
Don't say that! l'll wash myself
and l'll join you.

89
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,958
No! l'll tell you how it will be.

90
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,875
You'll wash yourself, than you'll wait
for one hour to remove this disgusting
smell.

91
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,500
And then will come the time
to go to my work.

92
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:18,958
Today you are in good state to
kick up. l waked up at 2 o'clock.

93
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,958
l looked at you for one half hour.
Then l decided to make something useful,

94
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,917
instead to watch television.

95
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,875
Daniel! There is no TV set!

96
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:32,917
- This is not an argument! This is a principle.
- There is no TV, no music,

97
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:35,917
no curtains, no sofa,
no vase to put some flowers.

98
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:39,875
And l have no received any flowers
long time ago.

99
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,583
So there is a fridge, but it's
full of motor oil.

100
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:45,917
- Lily!
- There is a shower, and it smells
of gas...

101
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,875
There is a jack, to jack up your car.

102
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:52,875
And your wardrobe is full oftyres.
There is no room for my dresses.
- Lily!

103
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,875
But in our state, we can afford the
luxury...

104
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,917
to have a garage.

105
00:14:57,917 --> 00:15:00,917
- What's wrong with you? ls this your
monthly period?
- No, it isn't!

106
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:03,917
l just can't live anymore in a garage!

107
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:06,417
l am a women. Do you remember
what it is?

108
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,875
lt's not something which only
smiles...

109
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:15,208
The women moves, thinks, evolves
and sometimes needs a little bit
of comfort.

110
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,542
And this is only because
l like the cars...

111
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:22,250
Women!

112
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:28,625
l can't get it. What a nice
aroma...

113
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,917
Lily, what are you doing?

114
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,875
- l'll return to my parents.
- You'll change the garage for a barrack?

115
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,917
A barrack with curtains, a small
garden and flowers on the table.

116
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:48,417
This is ridiculous. You can't
leave like that.

117
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,958
lt was amusing for you at the
beginning.

118
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,958
Yes, but it's not any more.

119
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,167
Yourjalopy is more important
for you, than me.

120
00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:00,000
The garage is too small for
us. l made my decision.
Good buy.

121
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:51,125
Hello girls. Are you having
a walk?

122
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:56,333
Take it easy. l am just kidding...

123
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,667
l'll see you later.

124
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,042
Hi! Can l come in?

125
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:12,792
Did you sleep here?

126
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,792
No, l just drowsed for 5 minutes.

127
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:19,958
5 minutes, it's not possible.
You have the file on your face.

128
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:23,000
l can tell you how long did you
sleep, because your face is like
a stump.

129
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,083
You know the trees. One circle,

130
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:27,250
one year...

131
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,167
20 years.

132
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,458
Forget about it...

133
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You know me. l always make jokes...

134
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,917
- That's what l am.
- May be l have to change you...

135
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:48,500
Hi guys. Would you like some grass?
lt's very good.

136
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:50,417
Oh, no, no...

137
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:55,083
- Don't be foolish. lt's high-quality.
- Really?

138
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:59,667
No, no. Who do you think we are?

139
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,292
OK. The choice is yours
Buy.

140
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,167
- Tell me...
- Hey! And some coke?

141
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,708
- Rashid!
- l am just asking.
- Right!

142
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:13,000
What are these shits?

143
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,042
And what are these posters on the wall?
- lt's Bob Marley.

144
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,708
This is a police station!

145
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:23,917
Do you know how long we are working
on this case without success?

146
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:25,917
- The gang of Santa Claus?
- The same.

147
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:28,625
lt's time to do something.

148
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:32,083
37 robberies for 8 months, without
any track.

149
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,708
Nothing, that we can use.

150
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,542
We are useless fools...

151
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,750
Are you sure...

152
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:48,750
you don't want some stuff. l'll call
Rashid
- No.

153
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:50,833
That will help you feel better.

154
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,417
What about a breakfast?
Rh?

155
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,083
The breakfast gives energy.

156
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,875
Ok, let's go to have breakfast.

157
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,792
You have a good appetite.

158
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,958
l couldn't eat, l couldn't
sleep for months.

159
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:28,083
l have terrible nightmares. Many
Santa Clauses are walking around me.

160
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,958
lt's terrible.
- Say no more. lt's really terrible...

161
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,667
Lice up your shoe.

162
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,917
And Christmas is coming, they
can hide easily in the crowd.

163
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:42,042
- That's right. ln July it would be
more difficult for them.
- Yes, they couldn't escape...

164
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,167
And now Christmas is coming,
and l am sure, they are ready
for their biggest strike.

165
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,167
One question worries me: Why are
they disguised as Santa Claus?

166
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,958
Take a look!

167
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,375
He is nice, he gives presents,
he is reliable with these red
clothes...

168
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,625
...Everybody points at him...

169
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,500
From other point of view...

170
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,625
it's a perfect disguise...

171
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,833
...to simulate...

172
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,417
A gun!

173
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,708
You are interested in our new
mixers?

174
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:40,917
Will you come again?

175
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,250
Hey you!
Freeze!

176
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,500
Don't move! You are under arrest!

177
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:13,542
- What happened?
- He tried to escape, but l was
really fast.

178
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:16,958
How did you know, he is a fake
Santa Claus?

179
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,958
How many Santa Clauses have a gun
with them?

180
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:23,000
- A gun! How did you know?
- He let it fall, the fool.

181
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,042
- What a fool.
- Yes, silly fool.

182
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:27,875
Let's go to the commissariat.

183
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,125
Hello boss! Look who is here...
Shit! He is gone...

184
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,792
Lock up the nippers to the chair.

185
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,125
The boss is not here. Let's say,
that l am the boss...

186
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
- How do l look?
- Don't do that, he could be somewhere
here...

187
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
He is gone. lf he comes, l'll
take care...

188
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,917
Trust me!

189
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,958
Well Santa Claus. l know your
name. Tell me, how did you get
a police gun?

190
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,625
Did you steal it?

191
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,583
Find his address.

192
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,250
l'll try this book.

193
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:09,042
Any time you forget something,
my colleague will help you to
remember.

194
00:22:09,042 --> 00:22:11,000
Did you see? He's professional.

195
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:15,000
You know, there is a registration
number here...

196
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,458
l'll enter it in the computer,
and l'll know the name ofthe
owner in one minute.

197
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:24,375
That fool! He stole the gun
from Giber!

198
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:29,875
- lmpossible!
- l swear. Take a look!

199
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,458
Did you know, that you have stole
this from the police chief?

200
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,208
Have you got an explanation?

201
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,042
He don't.

202
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,042
Do you think, he can speak
with sticking plaster on the
mouth?

203
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:43,208
You are right. Remove it.

204
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,250
Emilien?

205
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:53,083
Commissar?

206
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,708
Somebody calls me outside.

207
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:06,042
- What are you doing dressed like that?
- l am doing myjob, Emilien. l put on
these clothes to penetrate in thegang of Santa Claus.

208
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:09,042
But as usual you screw everything.

209
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:11,000
Sorry boss. l...

210
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:14,042
But why you didn't warn us.

211
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:17,042
We could disguise as Santa
Claus too.

212
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:21,042
Because it was individual precise
action. But don't worry.

213
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:25,708
l'll give you a special costume and
a truncheon. You could train on the
street.

214
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,042
- And now, would you unlock me!
- Of course commissar.

215
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:32,083
Damn it!
Alain got the keys.

216
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:35,375
- Hurry up Emilien.
- 5 minutes boss.

217
00:23:44,042 --> 00:23:46,833
- Are you the commissar Giber?
- Not yet.

218
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,667
l mean, l am not yet a commissar,
and unfortunately my name is not
Giber.

219
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,042
- l mean, mostly my name is not
Giber.
- The keys Emilien!

220
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:57,500
ln a minute boss.

221
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,625
Are you the commissar Giber?

222
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:12,250
Yes. What can l do for you?

223
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:16,000
Good afternoon.
My name is Qiu.

224
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,042
Qiu, Qiu, what a nice name Qiu.
And what a nice queue you have!

225
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,833
ls this a chinese name?

226
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:27,708
Yes. My mother is chinese, and
my father - swiss.

227
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,833
l know very well Switzerland.

228
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:35,083
l am a journalist from World
lnternational Magazine.

229
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:38,417
l have to write an article about
the French police.

230
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:43,000
l want to follow closely the work
ofthe big commissars, and l heard,
you are the biggest.

231
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,583
That's right. 1 ,90 meters are too
many even for a policeman.

232
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:51,125
How impressive.

233
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:55,083
Yes. Sometime l make an impression
to myself.

234
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:59,333
- Can l ''stick'' on you for few days?
- All my life, ifyou want.

235
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:03,917
l mean, as long as needed
to make your article.

236
00:25:04,042 --> 00:25:06,625
And you'll see how l work on
investigations.

237
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:09,042
Thanks a lot. Can we start?

238
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:11,542
With pleasure.

239
00:25:19,042 --> 00:25:21,000
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

240
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:27,583
What are you doing dressed
like Santa Claus in your
office?

241
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,208
Eh? This! This is a camouflage.

242
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:35,792
We are trying to catch a gang,
disguised as Santa Claus.

243
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:40,083
Dressed like that, we can penetrate
into it.

244
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:43,083
- And what are the nippers for?
- They are note mine.

245
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,833
An other question?

246
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:48,208
Come in.

247
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:53,125
- Do l disturb you?
- Nothing can disturb me anymore.

248
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:57,042
l see you are alone in the office,
you have nothing special to do,
and l would talk to you for 5minutes.

249
00:25:57,042 --> 00:26:00,083
No Petra, lt's not the time.
Can we talk at home?

250
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:03,125
At home you think only about
your work. l thought in the office...

251
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:06,000
...we could discuss some domestic
problems.

252
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Not today Petra.
Just not today.

253
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,833
Since 8 months you repeat ''Just
not today''

254
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,458
Listen, l am in the big shits,
don't do that to me...

255
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:19,042
What more happened after this
morning?

256
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:21,000
l caught a Santa Claus.
Santa Claus with a gun.

257
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,083
l thought he was from the gang.
- You don't need a Santa Claus or a gun
to think like that.

258
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:29,250
You always think about that.
- Yes, but there were both - a Santa Claus
and a gun.

259
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:33,083
l did it instinctively.
- And you disarmed him by yourself?

260
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,583
- Yes.
- Then everything is OK.

261
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,292
Absolutely not. lt was Giber.

262
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,167
OK, laugh at me.

263
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,833
l can lose myjob and you
are laughing...

264
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,042
- And what do you expect?
- Help me to relax.

265
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:52,083
Say something nice.

266
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:54,958
The good news help a lot.

267
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:57,167
Emilien! l am pregnant.

268
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,500
- No!
- Yes! Are these good news?

269
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:04,125
Of course. Since when?

270
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,875
- Since 8 months Emilien.
- No. -Yes

271
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:13,833
- How it happened?
- The Saint Spirit came to me
8 months ago.

272
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:17,667
8 months? ls it possible?
l saw the changes, but...

273
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:20,083
And your breasts...

274
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,375
...this is the reason to became so...

275
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,958
My God! Will you keep it?

276
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:31,125
- lt's too late for other decisions.
- Certainly.

277
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:34,042
- But why you didn't tell me?
- l try since 8 months.

278
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:37,583
l put cauliflower in all
the rooms.

279
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:44,042
- l was wondered what does it mean.
- Look, there are more than 20
echographic images on the wall.

280
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:46,417
There are everywhere.

281
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:59,792
- ls this my baby?
- For now it's mine.

282
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:02,917
lfyou want to take part, you have
to wake up!

283
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:05,500
ls the baby normal?

284
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:10,083
Good question, ifyou know the
father...

285
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:13,750
but yes, it's normal.
- lfyou are pregnant,

286
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:16,458
you'll keep the baby, and it's
normal...

287
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:22,083
then l'll became a father?
- Yes. Good conclusion.

288
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:26,125
- You should work at the police.
- l'll be a daddy.

289
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:29,542
Yes. And this child will need
a super-daddy.

290
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:35,083
Count on me Petra,
Count on me.

291
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:38,083
Lily!

292
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:49,875
What a fool you are.

293
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:54,875
You changed a car, for the woman
you love..

294
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:00,500
Fast test?

295
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:03,833
What fast test?

296
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:07,792
Two bars. What is this?

297
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:20,083
- Good afternoon. -Hello.
- Could you tell me what is this?

298
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:21,542
Just a moment.

299
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:27,042
Fast pregnancy test.
Was the prophylaxis efficacious?

300
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:30,083
l don't know.
You tell me.

301
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:33,542
Just a moment. l have to check
something.

302
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:53,833
We finished the blue condomes.

303
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,042
You know, a blue condome
and a baby. Women adore these
kind of presents.

304
00:29:57,042 --> 00:30:00,083
Do l need a blue condom like a
present?

305
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:03,208
l have to ask my daughter.

306
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:08,625
She studies pharmacy, and she knows
the names of all the medicines by
heart. She is so impressive...

307
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:12,167
Angel! What does it mean?

308
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:16,250
l am sorry daddy! l was so
careful, l swear...

309
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:20,083
But l had nothing for protection.

310
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:23,083
Darling! lt's full of preservatives.
Why you didn't take some?

311
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:25,917
- There wasn't his size.
- Who did it to you?

312
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,750
- l don't know?
- You don't know? He has no name,
this young man?

313
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:31,750
l told you, l was drunk! l couldn't
remember all the names.

314
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:33,417
Good Lord!

315
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,208
Come on. Marry Christmas.

316
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:39,875
Every one, listen to me.

317
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:43,083
l am explaining, what we have to
do against the Santa Claus gang.

318
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:46,125
Me myself, l made a perfect
individual action, unfortunately

319
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:49,125
upset by Emilien.

320
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:51,750
But this is in the past. Let take
a look on the future.

321
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:54,792
We'll do all, that we have to do
tomorrow, starting today.

322
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:59,042
Don't write that.
lt's a little bit complicated.

323
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,750
l don't like the misunderstandings.

324
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:05,083
- The nonsenses start...
- Yes, he's genius.

325
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,708
- What was l talking about? -The plan...
- Yes, the plan of action.

326
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:11,750
And l won't accept mistakes anymore.

327
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:15,792
Don't write that.

328
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:19,792
l want everything to be ''clean''!
''Super-clean''!

329
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:22,667
Last summer l was on a training
course at the american police.

330
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:26,958
This is some kind of language
reflex.

331
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:28,625
Crazy, eh?

332
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:33,833
l would like to sayjust ''go''...

333
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:38,708
...and the Santa Claus gang to be
caught beforeîre Christmas.

334
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:42,708
No more vacations, absences for
reason of health...

335
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:46,000
...or domestic disturbances...

336
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:52,083
Especially as, miss Piu, eh Qiu,
who is journalist, will give us

337
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:54,750
the honour to participate in
this mission.

338
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:58,083
Let make a good impression
about the French police.

339
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,292
The basic aspects ofthe mission are:

340
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,833
Concentration, Reflection, Action.

341
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:07,875
l named the mission:

342
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:09,458
Operation: ''Snow-white''

343
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,625
ln French: Blanche Neige.

344
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:16,750
l was right about the nonsenses.

345
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:20,083
- Yes, he's genius.
- From now, l want every one

346
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:26,125
available 24 hours by the day.
- Couchon? -Me -You? -Yes. -îlh

347
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:28,625
- What is this on your desk, boss?
- A gift?

348
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:32,875
- Very kind. For my birthday?
- lt's when? ln July.

349
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:36,958
lt's for Christmas. -Whatever.
l'll open it now.

350
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:50,083
Let see.

351
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:54,125
- Very nice. lt's from who?
- Someone, who knows you well.

352
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:58,500
- Did you see the little push-button.
- Yes.

353
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:03,958
- Ah! Put the guns down!
- He's genius.

354
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:11,125
Hello. This is Santa Claus.
l'll be waiting for you at noon,
in front ofthe Europern Park.

355
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:15,083
There will be presents. Hurry up
and catch me.

356
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:18,542
- What time is it?
- lt's 5 to 12.

357
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,750
General alert!

358
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:31,125
l sad quiet! How to work with
these cretins?

359
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:34,167
Don't write this, miss Qiu.

360
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:36,750
lt's a typical french conversation.

361
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:39,125
But we don't think like that.

362
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:44,458
This is Giber! Deploy you and
wait for my signal. Go!

363
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:48,750
For sure, they will come out
from the garage ofthe bank
with a fast car.

364
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:51,125
Anyway we'll surprise them.

365
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:53,083
Boss, are you sure that this is
the right way?

366
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:57,167
Certainly! They sent us a message,
where they are. They thought, we won't
come.

367
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:59,875
This is because they don't know
me, the commissar Giber.

368
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:03,333
l am here, waiting for the trap.

369
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,250
But boss, ifthis is the trap.
We are here and they are somewhere
else, working without disturbances...

370
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:10,792
Think Emilien, think. There is
no sense.

371
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:13,750
Why should they tell us about
their new strike.

372
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:16,750
- This is stupid.
- That's the think, that worries me.

373
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:20,917
- Till now they didn't nothing stupid.
- There is always first time. Trust me!

374
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,167
- Unless...
- Unless what?

375
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:26,417
They are sure, the could escape...

376
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:30,917
Escape from me? lmpossible. ln
any case l'll catch them.

377
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:32,667
- Boss!
- Yes?

378
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:44,542
To come out from this bank, they
have to pass over us.

379
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:51,000
What is this?

380
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,833
lt's, it's...

381
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:21,750
- Boss, are you ok?
- Yes, l am fine.

382
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:24,750
Why don't you start the pursuit?

383
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:28,750
- With these car?
- How should l know. lnvent
something. You have no imagination?

384
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:30,500
Confiscate a car!

385
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:37,167
l don't get it. He shown his
identities. Why they didn't
stop.

386
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,167
No one in Marseille stops if
there is a cop on the road.

387
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:41,833
They could slow down...

388
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:46,458
l am ok! Ok.

389
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:52,167
- Boss, we can use the other cars!
- You are right, Emilian! Get in the cars!

390
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:56,250
This is a unique security system.

391
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,833
lt's connected with the police
network.

392
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:03,208
lf necessary, you push on this
button, and the nearest police
car comes in a minute.

393
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,583
lt works.

394
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:16,208
- You have no eyes?
- You scratched my car.

395
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,583
Damn it!

396
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:41,208
Oh, my car!

397
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:57,292
Boss, this pursuit made a lot
of damages!

398
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:02,667
20 kilos pieces of iron more
or less, what's the difference.
Go, go!

399
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,000
We are going to port Marseille.

400
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:18,917
There are some historical monuments...

401
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:22,875
...builded by Louis XVll
in year 1661 ... Attention!
The car!

402
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:27,167
- Do you follow the situation?
- Certainly!

403
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:29,750
- Louis XVll in year 1661 ...
- l didn't mean that!

404
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:33,208
Follow the car with the big
tyres from the front.

405
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:35,083
Oh-la-la...

406
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:39,375
Always staff problems.

407
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:42,792
This young man for example, is
a good swimming instructor,

408
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:47,167
but he drives car like he has no
driving license...

409
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:51,875
- And does he have a license?
- No. l started working yesterday!

410
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:54,750
- But this is impossible!
- Calm down, Emilian. lt's a

411
00:37:55,167 --> 00:38:00,500
simple task. He just has to
follow that car. Piece of cake,
even for a swimming instructor.

412
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:07,583
- What should l do?
- Just follow them.

413
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:16,000
l know this kind of machines.
The fuel consumption is 100l/100km.

414
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:19,875
- lt will stop in 5 minutes.
- lfwe don't catch them in 5 minutes.

415
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:22,083
We will.

416
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:56,208
We disturbed a lot of people.

417
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:59,250
Don't worry. lt happens in France...

418
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,167
- But there are damages.
- Stop repeating the same!
- They disappeared!

419
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:05,833
- What, that is impossible!
- May be they are in the pool.

420
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:09,250
- That's better.
- Stop!

421
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,958
lt was really close.

422
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,458
Eh! Watch your steps!

423
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,917
Can we survive 5 minutes.

424
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:35,792
Sure. lt's water resistant.

425
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,917
ls it always like that in the French
police?

426
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,000
Absolutely not. ln the most cases
the cars leak.

427
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:45,417
Boss! l can't swim!

428
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:49,167
Don't worry!
There is a swimming instructor.

429
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:17,792
Ah, the little Daniel. lt's a pleasure
to see you.

430
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,917
l'll tell you something.

431
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:25,375
You meet too often my daughter.
Just kidding! lt's normal. Have
fun.

432
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:29,250
Did you see my chauffeur.
He is late.

433
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,292
l saw him at the crossroad.
He'll be here in few minutes.

434
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:35,292
- Very well.
- ls Lily at home?

435
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:38,833
Yes. Lily! Sorry darling,
l didn't see you.

436
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,250
lt's ok. l've got used.

437
00:40:42,292 --> 00:40:46,000
- Look who is here.
- Hello Lily. May l speak to you?

438
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,958
Not now. l am going to my doctor.

439
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:53,208
- Daddy, would you take me there.
lt's on the way.
- Sure, if my chauffeur appearssome day...

440
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:55,833
You know, l think he has some
problems.

441
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:59,250
- Should l take you?
- Affirmative.

442
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,000
Get in the car!

443
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,125
- Boulevard Cassini chauffeur.
- Very well madame.

444
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:26,333
Where were you. Daniel will
take us...

445
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,875
Go back to the barrack!

446
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:41,333
- l think you drove faster before.
- Who, me? But now is rush hour,

447
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:46,250
there is a lot of people, there are
too many cops. There is nothing wrong

448
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:51,208
driving slow sometimes.
- l agree, but l am late.

449
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:58,500
- What? What happens?
- l have pains! -Where?

450
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,375
- ln the abdomen.
- The abdomen? But it's terrible!
What should we do general?

451
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:05,292
How should l know? ls it so bad
darling?

452
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,375
- No-o. l am fine.
- You are fine? -l am fine.

453
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,792
She is fine.

454
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,917
She is fine...

455
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:20,917
Daniel, why are you so nervous.
What's wrong?

456
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:25,708
lt's because of Christmas. All
that people, the presents...

457
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:29,125
l see.
And what is this think on your
ear?

458
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:35,292
Nothing. lt's a new kind of
thermometer. lt's really fast.

459
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:38,333
One bar: ok.
Two bars: too bad.

460
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:44,667
- But there are two bars.
- l know! May be this is the problem.

461
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,167
Thanks for driving.
lt was very pleasant.

462
00:42:55,292 --> 00:42:57,167
See you later darling.

463
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,875
l am not a doctor, but your heart seams
to be desperate.

464
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:14,375
l understand your indisposition,
but l am still late.

465
00:43:20,292 --> 00:43:21,833
Ready: Start!

466
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:42,375
Come in.

467
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:46,958
- Cuckoo!
- Hello!

468
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,417
- Are you ok?
- l am fine.

469
00:43:56,208 --> 00:44:00,792
You see, our equipment betrays us.
How to work normally?

470
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,667
Don't write that:
We need new chairs,

471
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:09,250
the doors are not tall enough...
We have also car problems.

472
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,250
You saw, did you?

473
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:15,917
And the shoes are so small.

474
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:18,208
l feel terrible pains.

475
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:22,792
- But this is a shoe-pad!
- Oh! Someone played a practical
joke on me.

476
00:44:25,292 --> 00:44:29,250
By now 6 months have passed since l
have walking problems.
lt's not funny!

477
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,167
Relax commissar!
You are so nervous.

478
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,292
lt's because ofthat gang. The Santa
Claus gang...

479
00:44:40,292 --> 00:44:43,000
Don't think about it!
l'll take care ofyou.

480
00:44:48,292 --> 00:44:51,417
- Are you familiar with this?
- Yes, a little.

481
00:44:52,292 --> 00:44:56,333
lt was delivered last week.
Unfortunately, they took my
typewriter.

482
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,250
Relax commissar.

483
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:07,042
ln 5 minutes l'll brighten you.
- You think so?

484
00:45:07,292 --> 00:45:08,833
l am sure.

485
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,875
Ok, but for now l can't see.
ls it normally?

486
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:17,583
Yes, it is!
Relax!

487
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,125
l feel good...

488
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:33,625
l feel, like somebody empties me.

489
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:39,958
lt's just like that.

490
00:45:42,292 --> 00:45:45,917
- l am afraid, l'll fall asleep.
- l'll wake you up.

491
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:52,250
R-r-rh!

492
00:45:57,292 --> 00:45:58,958
lt was formidable.

493
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:04,333
Hey! What are you doing? Do you
know where you are?

494
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:06,667
- No. Where am l?
- ln front ofthe commissariat!

495
00:46:07,292 --> 00:46:11,875
- ls it true? Well, l have to park somewhere!
- l am in no laughing mood.

496
00:46:13,292 --> 00:46:15,917
- My compliments, general.
- Stay easy!

497
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:19,667
Thank you Daniel. l'll see you
this evening at home.

498
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:26,958
Daniel! Thank God you are here.

499
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,875
- Can l command your services?
- No! But like a friend, l'll
take you anywhere.

500
00:46:30,292 --> 00:46:32,458
l am so glad to see you.

501
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,958
- Tell me! ls it everything ok now?
- Yes, you can go.

502
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,208
And could you keep this parking
place vacant. l'll be back.

503
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:42,583
Yes, right.

504
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:50,292
- Step on the gas! l am late.
- Yes boss.

505
00:46:50,292 --> 00:46:53,417
- You can't imagine what happened
to me.
- Similarly you can't imagine whathappened to me.

506
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:56,958
- You simply can't imagine it?
- A promotion?

507
00:46:57,292 --> 00:47:00,292
lt's not about myjob!
lt's personal. Come on, guess!

508
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:03,417
- You'll get married?
- Better! l'll become a father.

509
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:07,083
- That's impossible!
- lt's possible!.

510
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:09,792
- You are genius.
- Lily is pregnant too.

511
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:12,667
That's impossible!

512
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:17,875
We are genius.
We'll become fathers together.

513
00:47:18,292 --> 00:47:21,417
lt's amazing. We are friends
for years. And now we'll have,

514
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:25,292
a baby together.

515
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:28,958
l mean separately...

516
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:31,958
...but at the same time.
- Everyone has his baby, and his
place.

517
00:47:33,292 --> 00:47:35,083
Exactly.

518
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:38,500
- Since when Petra is pregnant?
- Since 8 months.

519
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:41,958
- You could tell me till now!
- She told me this morning.

520
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:46,000
You are the first, who learns.
Even mamma doesn't know yet. And since
when Lily is pregnant?

521
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:47,875
- 2 bars.
- What do you mean?

522
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:52,375
2 bars. Some new mechanism.
You make the test, and it lets
you know how much you are pregnant...

523
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:55,000
Lily is pregnant 2 bars.

524
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:57,375
- lt's cool.
- Yes, it's cool.

525
00:48:10,292 --> 00:48:12,708
Commissar!
You have a visit.

526
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:16,000
What are you doing, Giber?

527
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:19,667
R-r-r, it's a pleasure to see you.

528
00:48:20,292 --> 00:48:24,667
Nothing! We just...

529
00:48:25,292 --> 00:48:28,333
This is a colleague of mine,
from China. She was explaining
me a way, to save my time.

530
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:31,958
5 minutes doze equal to 5 hours
sleep. lt gives energy.

531
00:48:33,292 --> 00:48:36,750
However the course is finished.
See you soon commissar.

532
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,625
Thanks.

533
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,958
Thanks my little Qiu.

534
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:48,500
So, what can l do for you?

535
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:55,292
There was cauliflowers everywhere
in my office, but l didn't
understand the meaning.

536
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:59,583
- lt's a big misunderstanding.
- Yes, you had to guess earlier.

537
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:04,250
- Why cauliflower?
- l don't know, may be it's a symbol
offatherhood...

538
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:08,292
lt was really a big mistake, Daniel.

539
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:12,250
Calm down. lt's not so bad.
You just don't know what the
cauliflower symbolizes...

540
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:15,083
- You think so?
- Sure! Petra will understand you.

541
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:17,917
- Thanks. Now l am calm.
- Don't be so calm,

542
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:21,208
you couldn't be sure with a future
mother.
- What do you mean?

543
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:24,958
During this period, they are
unpredictable.

544
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:27,875
Crisis could happen.

545
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:32,792
And the children, l think, that
they will occupy some place.
And time.

546
00:49:33,292 --> 00:49:36,333
We definitely have to change
our way of live.

547
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:38,917
You are right. We'll need time to
take them at sckoll.

548
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:43,000
That will be later. At the beginning
you'll have to hide the electrical
wall-plugs with sticking plaster.

549
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:45,917
- l'll have to do that?
- Exactly!

550
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:49,958
lt's a little bit otherwise, that
l was imaging.

551
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:53,417
- Did Rashid give you this shit?
- Yes.

552
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:56,875
- Do you know Rashid?
- A little.

553
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:02,375
The sun rises.

554
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:12,083
Tell me Daniel, Santa Claus
driving a scooter, isn't a little
bit strange?

555
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:16,542
Yes, normally it has to be
a sledge.

556
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,958
Follow him discretely.

557
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:23,292
5 minutes and you forget everything.
Stop thinking about yourjob!

558
00:50:23,292 --> 00:50:26,417
May be that brings your problems.

559
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:29,958
- Follow him.
- At your orders... Commissar!

560
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:54,542
Check out a scooter, registration
N 75BM13, over.

561
00:50:56,333 --> 00:51:00,167
- The scooter was stolen 2 weeks ago.
- Yes, l knew it, follow him.

562
00:51:00,417 --> 00:51:03,417
- You better call Petra.
- Daniel, we'll follow him,
then we'll call Giber,

563
00:51:03,417 --> 00:51:06,333
and he'll be in charge ofthis
case. You have my word.

564
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:09,375
-ie.
- l was waiting for some traces
so long.

565
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:13,083
- Would you stop that shit.
- Certainly.

566
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:21,333
Damn it! The first trace for months,
and l'll lose it!

567
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:24,375
Calm down. Each problem has a
solution.

568
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:27,250
What are you doing?

569
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:34,375
- Daniel, what's wrong with you!
- l am solving your problem. Any comment?

570
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:37,500
- No! But how do l stay like that?
- Bend your knees.

571
00:51:38,417 --> 00:51:41,208
What?
Ok, ok.

572
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:16,333
Well. You saw where he entered.
Now call the commissar!

573
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,917
Bla-bla! Stop talking.
l'll check out the situation.

574
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:23,417
Hey! You have a Santa Claus,
a stolen scooter and an abandoned
storehouse.

575
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:27,250
What do you need more?
His legal file?

576
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:30,500
l'll take a look!
5 minutes. What's the big deal!

577
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:43,000
- Bingo.
- Why don't you check for
plastic explosive?

578
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:46,000
Very funny. Let change our
position.

579
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:50,583
Follow me.

580
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:54,042
Why don't you call the commissar?
We had a deal.

581
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:57,875
Because his first question will be:
How many are they?

582
00:52:58,417 --> 00:53:02,292
l need to know. lt's the principle.
5 minutes.

583
00:53:21,417 --> 00:53:23,417
Emilien, l have a bad feeling
about this. Don't do it!

584
00:53:23,417 --> 00:53:27,375
Really? Go home then. lt's
my duty and l'll do it.

585
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:29,542
That worries me!

586
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:33,708
- l am worried only by Giber.
- Emilien. Enough!

587
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:41,208
Goodness!

588
00:53:46,417 --> 00:53:49,250
- Hello.
- l went to my doctor today.
Are you interested?

589
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:53,000
- lf he's a good doctor, l am interested.
- He's an excellent doctor.

590
00:53:53,417 --> 00:53:57,375
He was recommended by the prefect's
daughter. She has 4 children.

591
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:01,333
- We can beat her.
- l don't think l'll see you
again.

592
00:54:01,417 --> 00:54:04,042
Lily! l'll do my best. Don't
say that.

593
00:54:05,417 --> 00:54:08,000
Why do you whisper?

594
00:54:08,417 --> 00:54:11,417
Because of several Santa Clauses.

595
00:54:11,417 --> 00:54:13,750
They are here, around the dust-bin.
Lily! Lily!

596
00:54:16,417 --> 00:54:17,792
Damn it!

597
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,667
- What are you doing here?
- Guess.

598
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:43,417
You waste your time. l'll say
nothing. l can stand any tortures.

599
00:54:43,417 --> 00:54:46,333
Nobody force you talking.

600
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:49,750
We already know everything. And
the tortures are out offashion.

601
00:54:51,417 --> 00:54:55,417
There are more effective methods
to make a man talking.

602
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,625
No kidding?

603
00:54:58,417 --> 00:55:00,292
The tenderness for example.

604
00:55:01,417 --> 00:55:04,167
lt can be very dangerous arm.

605
00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:08,833
You are a pretty man. What do you
do in the police.

606
00:55:09,458 --> 00:55:11,458
l do myjob. Ah, don't do that.

607
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:15,375
l don't see any reasonable argument
against my opinion.

608
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:18,333
- Stop it! it's my mobile.
- Let see!

609
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:24,042
Oh, what a nice model!

610
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:27,875
- l think the battery is discharged.
- Don't do that!

611
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:32,042
You have no soul!

612
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:41,667
You are inhuman.

613
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:46,750
The hungerjustify the methods.

614
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:49,458
And l am very hungry.

615
00:55:57,375 --> 00:56:01,458
- Petra!
- l can't answer the call, because
l am very, very busy.

616
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,250
Leave a message, and l'll call you
back later.

617
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:08,208
Emilien, this is Petra. l suppose
you are on a mission.

618
00:56:09,458 --> 00:56:14,333
You have to know, that l
entirely trust you.

619
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,750
l know how much you love your
job, and how much energy you
put in work.

620
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:20,375
l think it's time to take care of
yourself.

621
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:23,417
Take some rest, have fun.

622
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:26,458
We must spend more time together.

623
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,750
That's all. Call me back when you
finish. Kisses.

624
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:35,833
Hello Daniel.

625
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:43,417
lt's you again. Did you see
Emilien somewhere.

626
00:56:43,417 --> 00:56:46,417
Yes actually! l drove him
free of charge.

627
00:56:46,417 --> 00:56:49,458
- You drove him. Where?
- He followed a Santa Claus.

628
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:52,500
- From the gang?
- l don't know, but l suppose so.

629
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,375
This Emilien. He found the gang's
traces quite alone.

630
00:56:55,375 --> 00:56:58,500
- Actually l was with him.
- Ok. We'll follow the plan.

631
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:02,250
- And Emilien?
- l'll take care of him!

632
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:10,833
Stay around. Well need you
for this mission.

633
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:14,667
- And Emilien?
- We'll find him before Christmas.

634
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:18,417
But l don't know in what shape...

635
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:21,000
lt's very promising.

636
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:33,292
- Commissar!
- Ah. Just in time. We are on the
gang's track.

637
00:57:36,417 --> 00:57:39,042
We'll bring them to their knees.

638
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:43,000
- Shall l come with you?
- Absolutely not. lt's an arrest,
not a Christmas party.

639
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,333
Please, commissar.

640
00:57:49,458 --> 00:57:52,375
Ok. Let's go. lt's not far away.

641
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:55,167
Hey! Follow us.

642
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:10,917
Deploy you!

643
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:22,083
The Christmas mood is everywhere.

644
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:26,250
lt's time to catch that gang.
- How did you know they are here?

645
00:58:26,417 --> 00:58:30,083
l have my own spying ring. My
brother, Jean-Robert. We went up
together for the police examination,

646
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:36,333
but he failed. And he copied
everything from me, but he
forgot to write his personalnumber...

647
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:41,458
That happens often. A friend of
mine...
- Ok. Enough!

648
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:45,792
And he called me last night,
and told me about a suspicious
activity in an underground passage.

649
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:51,125
l made an investigation, and
l found a tunnel between the bank
and the big stores.

650
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:56,125
So they will steal the turnover
ofthe big stores.

651
00:58:56,458 --> 00:59:01,417
No! They'll wait till Sunday morning,
and they'll rob the bank, dressed like
Santa Claus.

652
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:04,458
They'll penetrate trough the stores,
which are opened on Sunday.
- Exactly. And nobody gives attentionto them.

653
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:07,042
Yes! This is the reason the gang's
members to be disguised as Santa Claus.

654
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,083
Because ofthat they rob in
Marseille the last 8 months
without disturbances.

655
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,292
They are smart, but you commissar,
you are genius.

656
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:15,500
No, no. l would say:

657
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:18,833
lt's a matter oftraining.

658
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:22,375
- Can l make a phone call?
- Sure.

659
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:26,667
Ah! Emilien has the same phone
set.

660
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,542
Yes.

661
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:36,417
The stupid cops found out
everything. Switch to plan B.

662
00:59:36,417 --> 00:59:40,083
- Okay. Buy.
- What a nice language.

663
00:59:41,417 --> 00:59:44,458
- l mean the chinese.
- Boss, there are movements.

664
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:48,417
Get ready. Catch everyone.

665
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:52,292
The Christmas vacation is over.

666
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:54,250
Giber tells you!

667
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,958
What the hell is that?

668
00:59:59,458 --> 01:00:01,667
What happens here?

669
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,167
They will escape!
Do something!

670
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:10,292
l commandeer the vehicle.
Follow me!

671
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:34,125
- We have beautiful view.
- l see. ls it quietly in winter.

672
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:37,375
Yes, very quietly.

673
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:45,500
- Commissar! Wait for me!
- There is no time! Stop!

674
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:50,000
- As l mentioned we are in want offunds.
- Yes. But l see two cops using
one bike. lt's going too far...

675
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,417
You are right.

676
01:01:46,542 --> 01:01:50,167
Tell the chopper pilot, we'll
be in time.

677
01:01:56,542 --> 01:01:59,458
l'll miss you Emilien.

678
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:03,292
- Because l like you, you are not
going to suffer too much.
- That's very kind ofyou.

679
01:02:03,542 --> 01:02:08,000
You'll have the privilege to
know the exact time ofyour
death, thanks to this device.

680
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:12,375
lt's from my Swiss relations.

681
01:02:21,542 --> 01:02:25,583
Once started, the device will
set free that ball, which will

682
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:29,750
smash you at the first wave.

683
01:02:31,542 --> 01:02:36,000
- How much time l have left?
- You have exactly 5 minutes.

684
01:02:36,542 --> 01:02:41,542
- Cool.
- Use well your time to clean out
your soul.

685
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:47,458
You have to set free your
consciousness before you go...

686
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:51,125
...to the non-existence.
- Clean up everything for 5 minutes?
lt's not fair.

687
01:02:51,542 --> 01:02:53,292
You should start.

688
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,792
l'll take your mobile as a
souvenir.

689
01:03:04,542 --> 01:03:07,500
l am sentimental.
lt's from my chinese relations.

690
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:19,125
Go to hell!

691
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,208
Now l need a miracle.

692
01:03:43,542 --> 01:03:45,375
Oh, not the ball...

693
01:03:46,542 --> 01:03:48,292
Oh, not the taxi...

694
01:03:56,542 --> 01:04:00,292
Take me out Daniel. You can't
imagine what happened to me.

695
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,750
lt was terrible. And my mobile...

696
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:09,333
The bitch took my mobile phone.
We have to find her.

697
01:04:09,583 --> 01:04:14,250
- You don't know what she did!
- l just saved your life.

698
01:04:14,542 --> 01:04:17,667
- Am l wrong?
- No, you are right.

699
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,542
l risked my car to be broken
like a police jaloppy.

700
01:04:21,542 --> 01:04:25,500
- Don't say that. You are a good
driver.
- So say thank you for saving mylife.

701
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:29,125
lf l don't catch that gang, you
saved my life for nothing.

702
01:04:29,542 --> 01:04:33,292
Giber will kill me because of
my faults.

703
01:04:33,542 --> 01:04:36,542
We'll find that gang, but
first say: ''Thank you''

704
01:04:36,542 --> 01:04:40,500
How do we find it. They are
gone without trace.

705
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,083
- Say: Thank you!
- Thank you. ls it okay

706
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,542
Yes!

707
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:52,167
l am sorry, l am sorry.

708
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,583
l can't stand any more.

709
01:04:56,542 --> 01:04:58,208
The chinese...

710
01:04:59,583 --> 01:05:02,458
She tortured me for hours.

711
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:05,292
- She tortured you?
- Yes. lt was terrible.

712
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:09,458
- What kind oftortures?
- l've never seen something
like that.

713
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:14,167
l mean, you can't imagine.
lt's hard to explain.

714
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:18,000
l feel pain, when l talk
about this.

715
01:05:19,542 --> 01:05:21,542
l see.
Don't worry.

716
01:05:23,542 --> 01:05:25,625
We'll find the chines.

717
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:31,542
Did you see, did you hear something,
when you was captive. - No.

718
01:05:31,542 --> 01:05:34,667
They was talking to some chopper
pilot...

719
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:38,417
- They wore fur coats.
- Fur coats?

720
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,542
- Do you see something?
- No.

721
01:05:41,542 --> 01:05:43,917
- lt's cold
- Yes. ls this snow?

722
01:05:44,542 --> 01:05:48,625
Yes. And that means two things.
They come from high and it's not
far away from here.

723
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:52,583
That plus the fur-coats must mean
something.

724
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:56,333
- Probably.
- What can they do with all that
money in the mountain?

725
01:05:56,542 --> 01:05:58,625
And ifthey want to go over
the mountain. What is there?

726
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,250
Switzerland. Of course!

727
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:06,125
What a good plan...

728
01:06:06,542 --> 01:06:09,125
They'll travel by car as far as
possible.

729
01:06:09,542 --> 01:06:12,583
There are so many tourists.
Nobody will pay attention
to them.

730
01:06:12,583 --> 01:06:15,167
They will take offfrom some
ski station. There are a lot of
choppers.

731
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:16,958
They are genius.

732
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:22,292
Let find the ski station, which
is near the Swiss border.

733
01:06:24,542 --> 01:06:28,125
Val d'lsere.

734
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:39,250
- Did you see something?
- No. Absolutely nothing.

735
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:43,208
Sentinel N1 , negative.

736
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:48,083
- Where you'll spend your vacation?
- l don't know yet.

737
01:07:18,542 --> 01:07:21,125
Following the way of deduction,

738
01:07:21,542 --> 01:07:23,917
the car has to be somewhere here.

739
01:07:24,542 --> 01:07:27,667
- You look from the right side,
l look from the left side.
- Okay.

740
01:07:28,542 --> 01:07:31,542
Do you discriminate between
left and right?

741
01:07:31,542 --> 01:07:33,917
Ah, yes. You mean your right
side.

742
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:38,500
- Talk clearer!
- What's the difference, we are
side by side.

743
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:42,083
But l imagined l am facing you.

744
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:44,958
- What!
- Daniel! The car.

745
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:48,833
- Here it is.
- Turn right!

746
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:52,667
- Do you know where do you point to?
- No. All the directions are same for
me. What do you think.

747
01:07:53,542 --> 01:07:56,125
l'll turn right.

748
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:01,125
Be careful!

749
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:13,083
- What is this road, Daniel?
- l don't know. Look at the map.

750
01:08:17,583 --> 01:08:22,083
- These cars are a little bit
strange.
- Rental cars ofthe ski station.What's so strange?

751
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:24,250
What do they say?

752
01:08:25,583 --> 01:08:29,542
- You are 1 minute 10 seconds
late. ls that a problem?
- No, l'll speed up.

753
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:55,500
Oh no! Look at the ruts!

754
01:08:55,583 --> 01:09:00,292
We cant continue. The pursuit
is over.

755
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:02,792
The pursuit never stops.

756
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:09,667
lt's impossible follow them.

757
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:12,875
Take it easy. Nothing is impossible.

758
01:09:19,542 --> 01:09:22,250
What do you thing about my
collection autumn-winter?

759
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:26,250
Not bad.
Did you test it?

760
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:27,583
Never.

761
01:09:36,667 --> 01:09:39,458
- lt seems to be working!
- lt seems.

762
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:42,667
- How will we find them in the
mountain?
- We can follow the tracks, forexample.

763
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:46,333
Yes, good idea.

764
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:51,667
Do you have some device, ifthe
chopper takes off?

765
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:54,250
You became a little bit insolent,
you know?

766
01:09:54,542 --> 01:09:57,500
l am just trying to keep the
conversation.

767
01:09:57,583 --> 01:10:01,542
- Okay!
- May l use your mobile? The chinese
stole mine.

768
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:11,208
Put the money into the rucksacks.
We leave before sundown.

769
01:10:21,625 --> 01:10:22,917
Go back to work!

770
01:10:30,583 --> 01:10:33,500
- Do you think they are still there?
- lt's hard to say.

771
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:41,750
- Hello.
- Emilien! The operation ''Snow-white''
started.

772
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:46,208
l'll be close to you in 10 minutes.
Your commissar is with me.

773
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:50,000
- He insisted to participate.
- Oh, no.

774
01:10:51,667 --> 01:10:55,583
- Commissar!
- Yes? -Are you sure it's a
good idea?

775
01:10:55,583 --> 01:11:01,458
Listen to me Alain, l have served
under 13th division of special
forces for 18 months.

776
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:03,208
The mountain knows me!

777
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:06,833
- Yes. But it's so high!
- Have you seen the snow before?

778
01:11:07,583 --> 01:11:09,792
l prefer the heat.

779
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:13,083
Not me!
Let's go!

780
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:15,792
En route!

781
01:11:16,667 --> 01:11:19,667
- l'll take a look.
- l wouldn't do that.

782
01:11:19,667 --> 01:11:21,333
Just 5 minutes.

783
01:11:23,625 --> 01:11:26,542
Damn it. lt's always the same.

784
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:35,917
You were right. The road is
out of reach.

785
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:43,625
Did you see! You could wait for
a minute. Look what you did.

786
01:11:43,625 --> 01:11:47,583
- Take it easy. lt's just water.
- No, for now it's just snow, and
the snow leaves traces.

787
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:51,625
- Ok, l'll clean your car.
- You'll clean it with what?

788
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:54,583
l sad, l'll clean it. With what
is my problem.

789
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:03,208
Come on! Let's go.

790
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:10,292
- You'll take that risk?
- No. For now, i'll just drive.

791
01:13:21,667 --> 01:13:23,500
Damn it! Follow me!

792
01:13:27,667 --> 01:13:30,583
- Hey! lt's a forest.
- So what? Are you afraid of
forest.

793
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:33,542
No, l am worried about the car.

794
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:39,875
- Where are you going?
- Calm down. We are stable.

795
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:47,375
They call the chopper! Get ready!

796
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:55,000
- Boss! Are you sure...?
- Shut up Alain, everything's
gonna be alright.

797
01:13:56,625 --> 01:13:59,250
Go boys!

798
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:18,208
Damn it!

799
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:21,750
What happened?

800
01:14:26,667 --> 01:14:28,083
Wait for me-e-e!

801
01:14:40,583 --> 01:14:44,750
- lt seems, the cord is short.
- Of course it's short.

802
01:14:46,625 --> 01:14:49,583
- No, you can't do that.
- Just look.

803
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:54,542
Done!
Wait for me!!

804
01:15:05,708 --> 01:15:10,292
There he is the skier from
Austria...

805
01:15:13,625 --> 01:15:18,333
- Are you sure, that is the road.
- l think so, between the two poles.

806
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:25,083
The trail offers excellent conditions...

807
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:33,500
The skier is in perfect shape,
he improved all the times...

808
01:15:36,625 --> 01:15:39,583
...probably he'll be the new
champion...

809
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:48,542
The win seems to be sure...

810
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:53,833
What the hell is that?
A taxi?!?

811
01:15:54,667 --> 01:15:56,750
They finished together.

812
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:15,375
lt's too calm.

813
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:35,708
- You could give it to me like a souvenir.
- The place you go, the souvenirs are not
allowed.

814
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:39,125
But you'll have a time for
reflection.

815
01:16:39,667 --> 01:16:41,125
Lead her away!

816
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:46,750
Tell me, she have tortured you
for hours,

817
01:16:47,667 --> 01:16:51,542
and you are not so angry.

818
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:54,250
- You know, everything passes over.
- Certainly.

819
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:57,292
Did you see Giber?

820
01:16:57,708 --> 01:16:59,458
l am coming!

821
01:17:00,708 --> 01:17:02,375
O-oh! l am comi-i-ng!

822
01:17:03,708 --> 01:17:07,250
- Boss! Be careful about the landing.
- Calm down! lt's only snow...

823
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:10,833
Oh no!

824
01:17:13,708 --> 01:17:15,792
lt must be refreshing...

825
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:26,625
- Hello!
- Emilien? l'll bear.

826
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:30,167
- You'll bear? Now?
- Well, that will take some time,
but hurry up!

827
01:17:30,708 --> 01:17:32,375
l am on the way.

828
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:38,708
Commissar, Petra will have
a baby!

829
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:42,792
- l feel the party.
- Daniel!

830
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:52,375
l am here, l am here. Everything
will be fine.

831
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:55,792
Don't go anywhere.
This is not the time.

832
01:17:56,667 --> 01:18:00,917
Calm down. Everything will be
alright. Right?

833
01:18:02,667 --> 01:18:04,875
Emilien, hold on! Not now.

834
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:10,292
Look at the monitor. The contractions
will come in a moment.

835
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:14,250
On which monitor are the contractions?

836
01:18:14,667 --> 01:18:16,000
On this one.

837
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:18,833
Push! Push!

838
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:22,250
- What to push?
- Not you! You look at the
monitor!

839
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:24,042
Contractions!

840
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:28,083
Push, push, push!

841
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:31,042
Breathe, breathe!

842
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:35,375
- Not you! She has to breathe.
- Breathe darling, breath!

843
01:18:37,708 --> 01:18:39,042
Contractions!

844
01:18:40,708 --> 01:18:42,500
Push!

845
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:46,958
Push! Go! Go!

846
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:50,833
Now breathe, breathe...

847
01:18:54,667 --> 01:18:57,250
- l see the head.
- Eh. The head?

848
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:06,125
- Contractions!
- One more time!

849
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,625
One more time darling, push!

850
01:19:10,708 --> 01:19:12,083
Ok, relax.

851
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:16,542
Relax, relax, relax...

852
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:20,292
A very nice boy.

853
01:19:29,667 --> 01:19:31,000
l became father...

854
01:19:34,667 --> 01:19:36,208
Would you cut the navel?

855
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:43,417
l suppose, he'll do it later,
ifyou don't mind.

856
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:02,167
- What are you doing here?
- l am training.

857
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:05,917
- Why? Are you pregnant?
- No, but the woman l love is
pregnant.

858
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:08,833
l need some time to get used.

859
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:12,875
Where did you find that foolish?

860
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:15,208
l had the best of luck.

861
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:19,250
- l would promise her something.
- Like what?

862
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:23,708
Spend more time with her,
than with my car, be the best
father...

863
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:25,917
- And the fridge?
- The fridge will be empty.

864
01:20:27,708 --> 01:20:30,583
l'll be the best husband, if
she marries me.

865
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:32,917
- Does she believe you?
- Not at all.

866
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:36,542
But this is the first time, when
l am talking seriously,

867
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,875
and l am absolutely sincere.

868
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:44,375
Your sincerity touched me

869
01:20:44,792 --> 01:20:47,667
more, than the nice words.

870
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:50,708
Lily, would you marry me?

871
01:20:50,708 --> 01:20:54,792
lt's very easy, because l am
pregnant, and you thing l have
no choice.

872
01:20:54,792 --> 01:20:57,375
- Lily.
- ln any case this is not the way.

873
01:20:58,708 --> 01:21:00,917
To have a good family, you
have to do your best.

874
01:21:03,708 --> 01:21:07,167
Lily, would you give me the
honour to marry me?

875
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:10,583
- That depends.
- Depends on what?

876
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:13,958
How good lover you are.

877
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:17,708
You know, l won't disappoint you!

878
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:19,792
l have to check this!

879
01:21:27,792 --> 01:21:29,458
Emilien, Emilien.
