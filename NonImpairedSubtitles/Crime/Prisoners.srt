01:54:01,969 --> 01:54:04,036
I just talked
to our lab guys,

1608
01:54:04,038 --> 01:54:06,505
and they told me that all
the blood that we sampled

1609
01:54:06,507 --> 01:54:08,674
from the plastic containers --
pig's blood.

1610
01:54:08,676 --> 01:54:11,210
All right, you guys,
let's get this covered up.

1611
01:54:11,212 --> 01:54:13,078
It's supposed to snow soon.
Hurry up, okay?

1612

he's play-acting.

1613

I mean, case in point.

Except for the few items I.D.'D
by the dovers and the birches,

1615
01:54:21,689 --> 01:54:23,455
all the kids' clothes
that we found

1616
01:54:23,457 --> 01:54:24,957
still had the tags
on them.

1617
01:54:24,959 --> 01:54:27,025
And that maze book
that we found, he made it.

1618
01:54:27,027 --> 01:54:28,827
Photocopies,
pictures from this book

1619
01:54:28,829 --> 01:54:30,229
that we found
in the attic.

1620
01:54:30,231 --> 01:54:32,231
Ex-f.B.I. Agent
wrote that.

1621
01:54:32,233 --> 01:54:34,800
"Finding
the invisible man."

1622
01:54:34,802 --> 01:54:37,135
Yeah, it's about a theoretical
suspect that he believed

1623
01:54:37,137 --> 01:54:39,204
was responsible for a bunch
of child abductions.

1624
01:54:39,206 --> 01:54:40,739
It's totally discredited,
I guess,

1625
01:54:40,741 --> 01:54:42,241
but I read some of it.

Taylor -- Taylor was abducted
when he was a kid.

1627
01:54:43,844 --> 01:54:45,244
He ran away
after three weeks.

1628
01:54:45,246 --> 01:54:46,545
And the captor drugged him

1629
01:54:46,547 --> 01:54:48,513
on some sort of
lsd/ketamine cocktail.

1630
01:54:48,515 --> 01:54:50,849
He never remembered.
They never caught the guy.

1631
01:54:50,851 --> 01:54:52,651
Okay, so...

1632
01:54:52,653 --> 01:54:54,086
He read the book

1633
01:54:54,088 --> 01:54:56,521
and decided he was taken
by the invisible man.

1634
01:54:56,523 --> 01:54:59,157
Now he's doing
his best imitation, right?

1635
01:55:01,194 --> 01:55:03,929
Yeah, he <i>was</i> doing
his best imitation.

1636
01:55:03,931 --> 01:55:06,164
He killed himself
last night.

1637
01:55:06,166 --> 01:55:09,001
How did he do that?
I thought he was in custody.

1638

Hey.

1639
01:55:16,343 --> 01:55:18,410
Taylor drew this.
It's a map to the bodies.

1640
01:55:18,412 --> 01:55:19,678
It's a map to the bodies.

1641
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:21,613
And we found the same design
on a pendant

1642
01:55:21,615 --> 01:55:23,782
that we pulled off that corpse
the other day.

1643
01:55:23,784 --> 01:55:25,617
There's a connection.
Okay?

1644
01:55:25,619 --> 01:55:28,854
The connection is that it's
the last maze in the book.

1645
01:55:28,856 --> 01:55:31,623
I did it. It's unsolvable.
