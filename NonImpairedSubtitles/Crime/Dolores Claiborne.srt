1
02:07:33,811 --> 02:07:35,483
No, Dolores!

2
02:07:35,731 --> 02:07:37,722
Leave me be!

3
02:07:37,891 --> 02:07:39,847
Let go of me!

4
02:07:41,211 --> 02:07:43,167
Let go of me, Dolores!

5
02:07:43,971 --> 02:07:45,723
Let me go!

6
02:08:43,891 --> 02:08:46,041
Please, Dolores.

7
02:08:48,051 --> 02:08:49,848
Got a certified letter here.

8
02:08:50,451 --> 02:08:52,919
Never believe what happened
down at the dock.

9
02:08:53,651 --> 02:08:55,960
Dolores Claiborne, what the hell are you...

10
02:08:56,771 --> 02:08:58,045
Oh, my God.

11
02:09:00,531 --> 02:09:01,930
What have you done?

12
02:09:05,411 --> 02:09:08,403
Put it down. Do you hear me?
Just put it down.

13
02:09:10,691 --> 02:09:12,124
Jesus, Dolores.

14
02:09:17,971 --> 02:09:19,324
Oh, God.

15
02:09:20,291 --> 02:09:21,804
Oh, my God.

16
02:09:23,171 --> 02:09:24,399
You killed her.

17
02:09:48,171 --> 02:09:50,321
-So you lose the picture.
-Not happening.

18
02:09:50,611 --> 02:09:51,566
It's half a page.

19
02:09:51,651 --> 02:09:53,403
I'll let you write the caption.

20
02:09:53,491 --> 02:09:56,210
-Come on, Peter. It's crucial.
-It's salad.

21
02:09:56,731 --> 02:09:58,244
I'm setting up the whole campaign.

22
02:09:58,331 --> 02:10:00,447
It's a better piece without it.

23
02:10:00,611 --> 02:10:02,647
You already said it was brilliant.

24
02:10:03,811 --> 02:10:05,449
I said it was wonderful.

25
02:10:05,651 --> 02:10:07,403
-There's a difference?
-Yeah.

26
02:10:08,051 --> 02:10:09,120
Half a page.

27
02:10:12,451 --> 02:10:13,486
Fine.

28
02:10:14,131 --> 02:10:17,168
I only left it in so you'd cut it out anyway.

29
02:10:17,891 --> 02:10:19,563
I'm ready for Arizona.

30
02:10:19,651 --> 02:10:22,085
You should see what I have
for the malpractice piece.

31
02:10:22,171 --> 02:10:24,002
-The surgeon's ex-wife...
-Wait a minute.

32
02:10:24,531 --> 02:10:26,886
Had her on the phone
for 20 minutes last night.

33
02:10:26,971 --> 02:10:29,087
-I haven't assigned you that story.
-You will.

34
02:10:29,171 --> 02:10:30,206
Slow down.

35
02:10:31,131 --> 02:10:33,247
Come on, Peter. There's a book here.

36
02:10:33,331 --> 02:10:34,650
I deserve this.

37
02:10:34,851 --> 02:10:37,604
Why does every story have to be do or die
with you?

38
02:10:38,131 --> 02:10:40,520
You're not the only writer here, okay?

39
02:10:40,691 --> 02:10:44,047
I've got a dozen people out there
to keep happy. You know that.

40
02:10:44,451 --> 02:10:45,406
Great.

41
02:10:45,491 --> 02:10:49,086
So now you're not only not fucking me
anymore, you're fucking me.

42
02:10:52,851 --> 02:10:54,125
What is it, Helen?

43
02:10:54,291 --> 02:10:55,883
There's a fax here for Selena.

44
02:10:56,091 --> 02:10:57,046
From Phoenix?

45
02:10:57,131 --> 02:11:00,089
No, it's a clipping
from the Bangor Daily News.

46
02:11:01,011 --> 02:11:03,320
'"Socialite Dead,
Housekeeper Held for Questioning.

47
02:11:03,411 --> 02:11:06,608
-'"Mrs. Dolores St. George of...'"
-Where's the cover sheet?

48
02:13:57,771 --> 02:13:58,920
Fax?

49
02:13:59,251 --> 02:14:00,081
Forget it.

50
02:14:00,371 --> 02:14:03,010
They're hardly out of the 19th century
up here.

51
02:14:03,811 --> 02:14:05,164
Are you kidding?

52
02:14:05,611 --> 02:14:08,444
No, there's no motel. One restaurant.

53
02:14:08,691 --> 02:14:11,330
They've got me sleeping
on a cot in the town hall.

54
02:14:11,491 --> 02:14:14,449
Tell him to relax. This is no vacation.

55
02:14:14,611 --> 02:14:17,330
I'll be back on the mainland
as soon as I wrap this up.

56
02:14:27,491 --> 02:14:31,086
-Can I help you?
-Yes. I'm looking for Dolores Claiborne.

57
02:14:31,411 --> 02:14:32,685
And you are?

58
02:14:33,011 --> 02:14:34,364
I'm her daughter.

59
02:14:35,731 --> 02:14:37,164
I'm John Mackey.

60
02:14:37,291 --> 02:14:39,885
-Detective, Maine State Police.
-Hello.

61
02:14:41,251 --> 02:14:43,606
Would you please call
Constable Stamshaw?

62
02:14:43,691 --> 02:14:45,647
-Get him to come right out.
-Yes, sir.

63
02:14:46,131 --> 02:14:47,484
I'm sorry.

64
02:14:47,651 --> 02:14:49,881
No smoking. Public building.

65
02:14:52,371 --> 02:14:54,362
We've met before, Miss St. George.

66
02:14:54,451 --> 02:14:55,406
Have we?

67
02:14:56,051 --> 02:14:57,564
You were about 13.

68
02:14:58,491 --> 02:15:00,402
What year was that, the eclipse?

69
02:15:01,731 --> 02:15:03,483
Must have been, what, '75?

70
02:15:04,251 --> 02:15:05,730
I was the investigator...

71
02:15:05,971 --> 02:15:07,450
...when your father died.

72
02:15:07,891 --> 02:15:09,449
We met at the hearing.

73
02:15:10,291 --> 02:15:11,565
What's up, John?

74
02:15:11,971 --> 02:15:13,563
Miss St. George is here.

75
02:15:14,531 --> 02:15:15,566
Selena?

76
02:15:17,571 --> 02:15:18,845
Oh, my gravy.

77
02:15:19,091 --> 02:15:20,524
Frank Stamshaw.

78
02:15:20,851 --> 02:15:22,045
Marshall's brother.

79
02:15:22,771 --> 02:15:23,840
-Right.
-Jonesport High.

80
02:15:23,971 --> 02:15:26,883
-Of course. How are you?
-It's been quite a while, I guess.

81
02:15:26,971 --> 02:15:28,290
Certainly has.

82
02:15:30,371 --> 02:15:32,521
To be honest,
I'm surprised to see you here.

83
02:15:32,611 --> 02:15:35,921
Your mom's been pretty firm
about us not trying to contact you.

84
02:15:36,211 --> 02:15:39,248
-I didn't know Dolores made any calls.
-She didn't call.

85
02:15:39,331 --> 02:15:41,720
I saw the Bangor paper.
It was faxed to my office.

86
02:15:41,891 --> 02:15:43,085
And where's that?

87
02:15:43,251 --> 02:15:44,923
I came up from New York.

88
02:15:45,651 --> 02:15:47,448
Look, is she here or not?

89
02:15:47,571 --> 02:15:49,801
-Yeah. She's right upstairs.
-Thank you.

90
02:15:50,451 --> 02:15:51,406
But...

91
02:15:51,491 --> 02:15:52,526
John?

92
02:15:54,611 --> 02:15:56,124
Is she under arrest?

93
02:15:56,371 --> 02:15:57,804
Technically, no.

94
02:15:58,491 --> 02:16:01,403
Detective Mackey came last night,
and we're just starting.

95
02:16:01,491 --> 02:16:02,480
On what?

96
02:16:02,571 --> 02:16:04,926
We've scheduled an inquest
for Monday morning.

97
02:16:05,011 --> 02:16:06,967
We'll sort things out over the weekend.

98
02:16:07,051 --> 02:16:09,246
If she's not under arrest
why is she in custody?

99
02:16:09,331 --> 02:16:11,606
Right, okay. Vera Donovan is dead.

100
02:16:12,211 --> 02:16:14,771
There's an autopsy in Machais
this morning.

101
02:16:14,931 --> 02:16:16,205
And, you know...

102
02:16:17,171 --> 02:16:18,524
...she died from a fall.

103
02:16:18,691 --> 02:16:22,604
Your mother was the only person
with Mrs. Donovan at the time.

104
02:16:23,531 --> 02:16:25,283
That was her job, wasn't it?

105
02:16:25,811 --> 02:16:28,200
I'm afraid, Miss St. George...

106
02:16:28,931 --> 02:16:32,560
...there's a little more to this
than what you may have read in the paper.

107
02:16:40,851 --> 02:16:42,170
What are you doing?

108
02:16:43,611 --> 02:16:46,125
Straightening up this friggin' mess,
is what I'm doing.

109
02:16:46,211 --> 02:16:48,441
Gorry, but this place is a dump.

110
02:16:48,731 --> 02:16:51,165
Jesus. You're a suspect, you're not a maid.

111
02:16:51,331 --> 02:16:53,003
Just leave that be.

112
02:16:53,171 --> 02:16:55,082
There's someone to see you here.

113
02:16:55,571 --> 02:16:57,641
I told you, I don't want no lawyer.

114
02:17:03,971 --> 02:17:05,404
It's your daughter.

115
02:17:12,211 --> 02:17:13,849
My God.

116
02:17:14,131 --> 02:17:15,325
Look at you.

117
02:17:21,651 --> 02:17:22,925
You cut your hair.

118
02:17:25,411 --> 02:17:27,163
I didn't...

119
02:17:31,171 --> 02:17:32,126
You call her?

120
02:17:32,531 --> 02:17:33,884
Is that what you did?

121
02:17:34,771 --> 02:17:37,888
-Jeezly crow, you got some nerve.
-She's here on her own.

122
02:17:44,171 --> 02:17:45,399
Look at you.

123
02:17:50,811 --> 02:17:51,880
I'm just...

124
02:17:55,051 --> 02:17:56,530
My God.

125
02:18:00,371 --> 02:18:02,043
Is it really you?

126
02:18:15,571 --> 02:18:16,526
Look.

127
02:18:18,851 --> 02:18:21,411
-Hey, Ms. Claiborne!
-Kill anyone else today?

128
02:18:21,491 --> 02:18:24,528
Not yet. When I change my mind,
I know exactly where I'll start.

129
02:18:24,611 --> 02:18:26,283
-Go home.
-Where's the car?

130
02:18:26,531 --> 02:18:28,249
Right there across the street.

131
02:18:29,171 --> 02:18:31,082
You've been living at the Donovan's.

132
02:18:31,251 --> 02:18:32,366
It's a crime scene now.

133
02:18:32,451 --> 02:18:34,282
I got my own house, and you know it.

134
02:18:34,371 --> 02:18:37,090
We'd like her to stay here for at least
the next four days.

135
02:18:37,171 --> 02:18:40,686
If I decide to make my grand escape
to South America, I'll let you know.

136
02:18:40,771 --> 02:18:43,922
-I'd appreciate it.
-One last thing, Mrs. St. George.

137
02:18:44,131 --> 02:18:45,484
Name is Claiborne!

138
02:18:45,571 --> 02:18:47,687
I changed it when Joe died,
and you know it.

139
02:18:47,771 --> 02:18:49,966
I'm very sorry, Ms. Claiborne.

140
02:18:50,251 --> 02:18:51,889
'Morning, Pam.

141
02:18:53,611 --> 02:18:57,923
I'm sorry, but I think it's for the best
if you got some legal representation.

142
02:18:58,011 --> 02:18:59,239
You're sorry, are you?

143
02:18:59,451 --> 02:19:02,682
Last time you were sorry was
when you had to use the pay toilet...

144
02:19:02,771 --> 02:19:04,921
...and the string on your pet dime broke.

145
02:19:24,971 --> 02:19:27,804
I'm just muzzy here,
trying to think of what to say.

146
02:19:30,451 --> 02:19:31,964
All grown up...

147
02:19:32,451 --> 02:19:33,566
...looking so...

148
02:19:33,811 --> 02:19:36,279
You turned out a beautiful woman, Selena.

149
02:19:36,811 --> 02:19:38,608
I just can't believe you're here.

150
02:19:39,651 --> 02:19:41,482
That makes two of us.

151
02:19:44,691 --> 02:19:47,080
There must be a reason
why you go out of your way...

152
02:19:47,171 --> 02:19:49,162
...to antagonize them like that.

153
02:19:49,971 --> 02:19:53,008
Sometimes being a bitch
is all a woman has to hold onto.

154
02:19:58,131 --> 02:19:59,325
Nice car.

155
02:19:59,571 --> 02:20:00,640
It's a rental.

156
02:20:02,491 --> 02:20:04,607
You pay by the day or by the week?

157
02:20:05,291 --> 02:20:08,363
I assume that's your way of asking
how long I'm staying.

158
02:20:08,691 --> 02:20:11,251
Good gorry, you're more nervous than me.

159
02:20:11,571 --> 02:20:13,880
I have to be in Phoenix on Monday.

160
02:20:14,571 --> 02:20:19,087
It's a big story. I'm trying to get out of it,
but it may not be possible, all right?

161
02:20:24,531 --> 02:20:25,805
I didn't kill her.

162
02:20:27,771 --> 02:20:30,285
I didn't push her down
that friggin' staircase.

163
02:20:30,771 --> 02:20:32,443
That's what you want to know?

164
02:20:32,531 --> 02:20:33,964
Well, I'm telling you.

165
02:20:34,051 --> 02:20:38,124
I did not murder that bitch any more
than I'm wearing a diamond tiara.

166
02:20:38,571 --> 02:20:39,970
He's got an eyewitness...

167
02:20:40,291 --> 02:20:43,806
...who puts you standing over a dead body
with a rolling pin.

168
02:20:43,971 --> 02:20:45,165
When did you start smoking?

169
02:20:45,251 --> 02:20:48,323
Are you not listening to me?
They're talking murder here.

170
02:20:50,811 --> 02:20:53,006
You're lucky I didn't have to post bail.

171
02:21:19,611 --> 02:21:20,964
Spooky, ain't it?

172
02:21:21,971 --> 02:21:24,121
Can't stand out here all day.

173
02:21:26,331 --> 02:21:27,650
What a mess.

174
02:21:28,771 --> 02:21:30,363
A regular bunch of artistes.

175
02:21:33,211 --> 02:21:34,849
Look at this mess.

176
02:21:38,291 --> 02:21:40,282
Cheese and crackers.

177
02:21:45,651 --> 02:21:47,448
Friggin' little bastards.

178
02:21:47,651 --> 02:21:49,642
I've got an idea who they are, too.

179
02:21:55,731 --> 02:21:57,164
Let me try.

180
02:22:31,491 --> 02:22:32,719
Selena.

181
02:22:35,651 --> 02:22:37,004
Get in the house.

182
02:22:38,171 --> 02:22:41,004
Selena, I said get in the house, right now.

183
02:22:42,011 --> 02:22:43,888
I am in the house.

184
02:23:16,251 --> 02:23:18,048
It's cold, I know.

185
02:23:20,851 --> 02:23:22,648
God, it's a dust bowl.

186
02:23:24,571 --> 02:23:26,562
Thank God I kept the electric up.

187
02:23:28,691 --> 02:23:31,967
I got some wood.
We'll have hot water pretty quick.

188
02:23:34,491 --> 02:23:37,005
Clean linens upstairs, last I looked.

189
02:23:38,771 --> 02:23:41,808
Longer you stand there,
the more boogery it's gonna feel.

190
02:23:43,891 --> 02:23:44,926
It's dead.

191
02:23:46,371 --> 02:23:48,407
It's off three years, at least.

192
02:23:49,851 --> 02:23:52,524
I'd know that if I called more often, right?

193
02:23:54,531 --> 02:23:56,999
You called Vera's last Christmas.

194
02:23:57,891 --> 02:23:59,927
The lines go both ways, Mother.

195
02:24:05,331 --> 02:24:08,528
Look, this isn't gonna work.
I need a phone.

196
02:24:08,771 --> 02:24:10,602
I'm gonna stay at the motel.

197
02:24:11,411 --> 02:24:12,321
It's closed.

198
02:24:12,531 --> 02:24:14,010
It's off-season.

199
02:24:15,531 --> 02:24:17,328
What about Riner's Inn?

200
02:24:17,531 --> 02:24:19,010
He's gone.

201
02:24:19,411 --> 02:24:20,730
Burned down.

202
02:24:21,051 --> 02:24:23,565
Must be five years ago by now.

203
02:24:25,491 --> 02:24:26,241
Shit.

204
02:24:28,611 --> 02:24:30,283
There's phones in town.

205
02:24:30,451 --> 02:24:32,919
-We've gotta go shoppin' anyway.
-I'll go.

206
02:24:33,331 --> 02:24:34,241
Alone.

207
02:24:35,811 --> 02:24:37,369
I'll take care of it.

208
02:24:37,971 --> 02:24:39,723
You don't know what we need.

209
02:24:40,411 --> 02:24:42,527
I'm assuming it's everything.

210
02:26:27,291 --> 02:26:30,920
You know what? I've got a game.
Do you know how to count by fives?

211
02:26:31,011 --> 02:26:34,799
You don't. I can teach you.
I know you are. You're smart.

212
02:26:35,611 --> 02:26:38,842
Let's count by fives. You want to play
hide and seek? Ready?

213
02:26:39,531 --> 02:26:41,965
5, 10,15, 20...

214
02:26:42,051 --> 02:26:44,042
...25, 30.

215
02:26:49,891 --> 02:26:53,486
Where is she? Where did she go?
I can't find Selena anywhere.

216
02:26:53,931 --> 02:26:58,607
I hear an awful lot of thunder upstairs,
but I can't find Selena anywhere.

217
02:26:58,691 --> 02:26:59,646
Where is she?

218
02:26:59,731 --> 02:27:01,244
Is she lost?

219
02:27:01,371 --> 02:27:03,248
What was that I heard?

220
02:27:03,771 --> 02:27:05,204
What did I hear?

221
02:27:05,491 --> 02:27:07,766
I don't know. I think I heard something.

222
02:27:28,131 --> 02:27:29,564
There you are.

223
02:27:30,611 --> 02:27:32,522
Let me help you. That's my job.

224
02:27:32,691 --> 02:27:35,125
-You must be starving.
-All these calls.

225
02:27:35,331 --> 02:27:37,242
Ended up longer than I thought.

226
02:27:37,371 --> 02:27:38,599
Water's warm.

227
02:27:38,771 --> 02:27:41,205
You'll want a nice, hot bath. I got this.

228
02:27:41,291 --> 02:27:43,600
I spent an hour finding this radiologist...

229
02:27:43,691 --> 02:27:46,489
...just so that he could tell me
he won't go on record.

230
02:27:46,771 --> 02:27:48,363
Is that your new story?

231
02:27:52,211 --> 02:27:54,122
You say there's hot water?

232
02:27:56,251 --> 02:27:58,765
Why don't you go on up
and get yourself fresh?

233
02:28:00,891 --> 02:28:01,846
Go on.

234
02:28:02,011 --> 02:28:03,285
It won't bite you.

235
02:28:42,291 --> 02:28:44,043
Must be a lot of pressure.

236
02:28:45,971 --> 02:28:47,370
All them famous people...

237
02:28:47,451 --> 02:28:48,850
...talking to them.

238
02:28:49,651 --> 02:28:51,448
I framed the picture.

239
02:28:52,051 --> 02:28:53,689
You and Richard Nixon.

240
02:28:53,851 --> 02:28:55,569
He was selling a book.

241
02:28:55,891 --> 02:28:57,324
I got a scrapbook.

242
02:28:57,411 --> 02:28:59,129
Saved all your articles.

243
02:28:59,331 --> 02:29:01,925
Drugstore in Jonesport puts them aside
for me.

244
02:29:02,971 --> 02:29:04,689
I used to read them to Vera...

245
02:29:06,251 --> 02:29:08,367
...when she was clear enough to listen.

246
02:29:09,651 --> 02:29:11,607
You've done so well for yourself.

247
02:29:12,531 --> 02:29:14,283
Is that what you think?

248
02:29:14,691 --> 02:29:16,090
How well I've done?

249
02:29:17,331 --> 02:29:22,007
Hell, even Miss Vera Kiss-My-Back-Cheeks
Donovan couldn't help but be impressed.

250
02:29:22,211 --> 02:29:25,647
Her look when she saw
that picture-on-the-cover story...

251
02:29:25,731 --> 02:29:28,040
You would've thought she passed a brick.

252
02:29:30,331 --> 02:29:32,128
Maybe you ought to slow down.

253
02:29:32,211 --> 02:29:34,361
Believe me, I know my limit.

254
02:29:37,531 --> 02:29:39,283
Don't that sound familiar?

255
02:29:44,211 --> 02:29:46,281
I'd leave it alone if I were you.

256
02:29:47,331 --> 02:29:49,447
I've seen my share of drunks, is all.

257
02:29:50,331 --> 02:29:51,730
That's all I'm sayin'.

258
02:29:53,091 --> 02:29:55,207
What did he have to be happy about?

259
02:29:58,651 --> 02:30:01,449
I suppose making sure everyone was
as miserable as he was.

260
02:30:04,891 --> 02:30:06,609
Is that why you killed him?

261
02:30:22,451 --> 02:30:24,601
Oh, tough question, I guess.

262
02:30:26,491 --> 02:30:27,924
Occupational hazard.

263
02:30:30,171 --> 02:30:32,207
Don't feel too bad, Ma.

264
02:30:32,371 --> 02:30:35,249
I asked Jean Harris the same thing once.

265
02:30:41,011 --> 02:30:42,330
Let's face it, Mother.

266
02:30:42,411 --> 02:30:43,685
We barely know each other.

267
02:30:43,771 --> 02:30:47,559
We haven't spoken in years, and that's
as much your doing as it is mine.

268
02:30:48,891 --> 02:30:50,927
You didn't kill Vera, great.

269
02:30:51,131 --> 02:30:52,928
You've got nothing to worry about.

270
02:30:53,051 --> 02:30:55,724
If you did, then you deserve
whatever comes.

271
02:30:56,011 --> 02:30:57,046
Just...

272
02:30:57,331 --> 02:31:01,802
...let's not pretend we're in some goddamn
Norman Rockwell family reunion here.

273
02:31:02,171 --> 02:31:04,890
I'm sorry, Ma, but that's where we are.

274
02:31:05,731 --> 02:31:07,562
And as for Dad...

275
02:31:08,211 --> 02:31:10,771
...the few memories I have of him...

276
02:31:11,811 --> 02:31:12,846
...I'd like to keep.

277
02:31:15,051 --> 02:31:17,042
Are you listening to me?

278
02:31:31,011 --> 02:31:31,966
Daddy.

279
02:31:33,011 --> 02:31:34,603
We made tapioca!

280
02:31:34,811 --> 02:31:35,926
Get out.

281
02:31:36,251 --> 02:31:39,084
We did. And it's not instant either.

282
02:31:39,291 --> 02:31:41,168
And with real cream.

283
02:31:41,531 --> 02:31:45,444
And the next thing you'll tell me
is you made it just for me, right?

284
02:31:46,931 --> 02:31:49,650
Oh, McCrea, there's that St. George smile.

285
02:31:50,491 --> 02:31:53,881
-Don't you look just like my mother?
-That's enough fooling around.

286
02:31:53,971 --> 02:31:56,087
Tell her she's got homework to do.

287
02:31:56,251 --> 02:31:58,128
You better do your homework.

288
02:32:03,451 --> 02:32:05,646
Theo called about the chain winch.

289
02:32:06,171 --> 02:32:09,243
He's got them parts sittin' there.
Says he'll go as high as $250.

290
02:32:09,811 --> 02:32:11,881
I changed my mind. I ain't sellin'.

291
02:32:13,651 --> 02:32:15,721
It's not worth $100. You said so yourself.

292
02:32:16,091 --> 02:32:17,922
He's got those boats in dry dock.

293
02:32:18,011 --> 02:32:19,888
He needs the damn thing.

294
02:32:20,371 --> 02:32:23,283
Ain't that the point in AA,
helpin' out your buddies?

295
02:32:24,411 --> 02:32:25,639
'"Helpin' out.'"

296
02:32:25,811 --> 02:32:27,164
Shit.

297
02:32:31,491 --> 02:32:34,722
Besides, if I get that thing runnin',
it's worth $250 a month.

298
02:32:38,371 --> 02:32:40,839
Goddamn it! The soda's warm!

299
02:32:40,971 --> 02:32:44,680
I only got home a half hour ago.
It went in first thing.

300
02:32:45,051 --> 02:32:47,440
It's hard enough drinkin' this stuff cold.

301
02:32:53,571 --> 02:32:55,209
What's so fuckin' funny?

302
02:32:56,331 --> 02:32:58,003
Your pants.

303
02:32:58,291 --> 02:33:00,521
They're split clear the way up.

304
02:33:03,171 --> 02:33:05,082
Well, ain't that a scream!

305
02:33:08,051 --> 02:33:10,611
You're pretty goddamn frisky
all of a sudden, Dolores.

306
02:33:13,851 --> 02:33:17,844
Let me guess. I'll bet that Vera Donovan's
got a whole freezer full of soda.

307
02:33:19,571 --> 02:33:22,483
Take them off. I'll mend them after supper.

308
02:33:22,651 --> 02:33:24,209
What's the deal?

309
02:33:24,291 --> 02:33:27,886
You kiss that rich summer ass all day long,
you got nothin' left for me.

310
02:33:29,691 --> 02:33:33,001
Just remember, your father used to scrape
my old man's boat...

311
02:33:33,171 --> 02:33:35,685
...so don't be gettin' high and mighty
on me.

312
02:33:36,051 --> 02:33:39,168
If you still had the boats,
we wouldn't need the extra money.

313
02:33:47,571 --> 02:33:48,765
Looky here.

314
02:33:56,571 --> 02:33:58,289
A big old smiley moon.

315
02:33:58,691 --> 02:34:00,090
This is just for you.

316
02:34:00,891 --> 02:34:02,370
Want to see the dark side?

317
02:34:02,811 --> 02:34:04,722
Yeah, I guess it is pretty funny.

318
02:34:09,651 --> 02:34:12,768
I hope you haven't been walkin' around
like that all day long.

319
02:34:17,371 --> 02:34:19,282
Why the hell'd you make me do it?

320
02:34:49,531 --> 02:34:52,170
14 times 4 equals 28?

321
02:34:54,051 --> 02:34:55,245
Go on.

322
02:34:55,411 --> 02:34:56,810
Sure it is. It's 14.

323
02:34:56,891 --> 02:34:57,926
It's not!

324
02:34:58,011 --> 02:34:59,080
You take 14...

325
02:34:59,171 --> 02:35:01,207
...you bend it till it snaps in half...

326
02:35:05,011 --> 02:35:06,922
Could I have another, with raisins?

327
02:35:07,051 --> 02:35:09,406
Not till after dinner.

328
02:35:09,931 --> 02:35:13,321
-You were right about that real cream.
-He loved the raisins.

329
02:35:13,731 --> 02:35:15,926
He said it's my best ever.

330
02:35:16,251 --> 02:35:17,969
Mom, the cabbage.

331
02:35:18,131 --> 02:35:20,201
Move it off the heat for me, will ya?

332
02:35:21,171 --> 02:35:22,286
I'm just...

333
02:35:23,571 --> 02:35:25,482
I'm just resting here a minute.

334
02:35:25,851 --> 02:35:27,284
That's right.

335
02:35:27,651 --> 02:35:30,529
She run her mouth off
till she got tuckered out.

336
02:35:33,211 --> 02:35:34,849
Plum tuckered out.

337
02:35:40,851 --> 02:35:41,966
Mom?

338
02:35:42,651 --> 02:35:44,403
Do you want me to set the table?

339
02:35:46,931 --> 02:35:48,887
That'd be nice. Thank you, dear.

340
02:35:57,811 --> 02:36:00,530
Stay tuned now for Walter Cronkite.

341
02:36:02,011 --> 02:36:07,039
Each girl is representing a lifeguard station
up the length of Alquinin Beach.

342
02:36:07,611 --> 02:36:10,079
'"Algonquin,'" you goddamn flylander.

343
02:36:19,771 --> 02:36:23,127
Damn it, that better not be one
of my mother's dishes.

344
02:36:25,851 --> 02:36:28,206
You ought to take a look at this.

345
02:36:29,171 --> 02:36:32,208
You might want to see
what an ass is supposed to look like.

346
02:36:33,131 --> 02:36:34,769
Them guys on the boat...

347
02:36:35,011 --> 02:36:36,205
...always talking...

348
02:36:36,291 --> 02:36:39,169
...everybody saying what a looker you are.

349
02:36:39,491 --> 02:36:42,449
You know what I do?
I come right to your defense.

350
02:36:42,771 --> 02:36:47,162
I say, '"Shit, she may be ugly now, but you
should've seen her when I was drinkin'.'"

351
02:36:53,851 --> 02:36:56,729
My mother warned me
you'd let yourself go.

352
02:36:58,011 --> 02:37:00,127
Fat ass, lousy cooking...

353
02:37:02,291 --> 02:37:04,043
...running that goddamn mouth...

354
02:37:06,811 --> 02:37:09,120
Guess what, Joe? I ain't tired anymore.

355
02:37:10,531 --> 02:37:13,682
You better sit back down,
if you don't want this in your head.

356
02:37:14,611 --> 02:37:15,646
Mommy?

357
02:37:19,811 --> 02:37:21,244
Go on back to bed, honey.

358
02:37:21,371 --> 02:37:24,283
Your father and I are just having
a little discussion here.

359
02:37:24,851 --> 02:37:26,364
Is everything all right?

360
02:37:26,611 --> 02:37:27,646
Yeah.

361
02:37:28,131 --> 02:37:29,325
Isn't it, Joe?

362
02:37:31,491 --> 02:37:33,243
Right as rain.

363
02:37:34,291 --> 02:37:35,724
You go ahead, honey.

364
02:37:36,051 --> 02:37:37,404
Go on back to bed now.

365
02:37:37,851 --> 02:37:38,761
Daddy?

366
02:37:38,931 --> 02:37:40,125
Go on.

367
02:37:46,611 --> 02:37:48,203
Oh, bitch...

368
02:37:48,491 --> 02:37:51,085
...ain't you gonna get a payback.

369
02:37:55,851 --> 02:37:58,604
Go on. All I ask is that you do it quick.

370
02:37:58,851 --> 02:38:01,001
Don't let Selena see the mess
once it's over.

371
02:38:01,091 --> 02:38:03,969
You want to run me down?
You go right ahead.

372
02:38:04,251 --> 02:38:06,924
You can be as mean and hurtful
as you want.

373
02:38:07,091 --> 02:38:10,049
But this is the last time
you will ever hit me.

374
02:38:11,051 --> 02:38:12,370
You do it again...

375
02:38:13,011 --> 02:38:15,400
...one of us is going to the bone yard.

376
02:38:19,971 --> 02:38:22,439
Well, make yourself useful, woman.

377
02:38:23,411 --> 02:38:25,481
Bring me a towel for my head!

378
02:38:25,931 --> 02:38:28,206
I'm bleeding all over my goddamn shirt!

379
02:38:42,291 --> 02:38:44,759
That was one lesson he got the first time.

380
02:38:45,291 --> 02:38:46,849
Maybe the only one.

381
02:38:51,171 --> 02:38:52,843
It's been a long day.

382
02:38:53,811 --> 02:38:55,244
You must be tired.

383
02:38:56,731 --> 02:38:58,449
What do you want me to say?

384
02:38:59,091 --> 02:39:00,683
'"Thanks for sharing?'"

385
02:39:33,771 --> 02:39:35,887
Been looking all over for you.

386
02:39:37,051 --> 02:39:38,769
It's as cold as Christmas.

387
02:39:39,411 --> 02:39:40,844
What are you doing?

388
02:39:41,331 --> 02:39:42,844
I couldn't sleep.

389
02:39:44,611 --> 02:39:46,203
Catch your death out here.

390
02:39:47,011 --> 02:39:48,603
Tell me about Plan B.

391
02:39:48,771 --> 02:39:51,080
I want you to tell me
you've got a plan, Mother.

392
02:39:51,171 --> 02:39:53,639
If it's about money, it shouldn't be.

393
02:39:54,811 --> 02:39:56,847
I've got my sociable security.

394
02:39:57,171 --> 02:39:59,401
I can still work. I don't need much.

395
02:39:59,491 --> 02:40:00,810
You need a lawyer.

396
02:40:00,891 --> 02:40:04,122
These guys don't say '"get an attorney'"
unless they mean it.

397
02:40:05,811 --> 02:40:07,961
It's you I'm worried about, Selena.

398
02:40:08,851 --> 02:40:10,842
Let's not get off track here.

399
02:40:13,811 --> 02:40:15,244
You're my daughter.

400
02:40:16,451 --> 02:40:19,966
I know that probably feels like something
better left alone, but it's true.

401
02:40:21,211 --> 02:40:22,690
You're still my Selena.

402
02:40:22,931 --> 02:40:26,367
You're still my good girl.
I can't help but be worried for you.

403
02:40:26,531 --> 02:40:28,601
My God, your hands.

404
02:40:30,771 --> 02:40:31,965
Scary.

405
02:40:38,211 --> 02:40:40,361
I guess if you want to know
somebody's life...

406
02:40:41,131 --> 02:40:42,849
...you look at their hands.

407
02:40:50,331 --> 02:40:53,721
That's what 22 years of Vera Donovan
will do to you.

408
02:40:59,091 --> 02:41:01,889
Mrs. Donovan, I promise
there won't be any boys.

409
02:41:01,971 --> 02:41:03,484
You're ex cused, Susan.

410
02:41:03,771 --> 02:41:05,170
But Mrs. Donovan, please!

411
02:41:05,251 --> 02:41:07,560
Look on the bright side, dear.

412
02:41:07,651 --> 02:41:09,960
You may not have gotten the job...

413
02:41:10,131 --> 02:41:12,599
...but think what fun you'll have
telling friends...

414
02:41:12,691 --> 02:41:14,727
...what a bitch Vera Donovan is.

415
02:41:18,211 --> 02:41:19,246
Next!

416
02:41:24,291 --> 02:41:26,566
I've been working since I was 13 years old.

417
02:41:26,651 --> 02:41:30,849
Started by housekeeping in a hotel.
By the time I left there and high school...

418
02:41:30,931 --> 02:41:33,650
...I was cleaning three floors all by myself.

419
02:41:34,451 --> 02:41:37,488
I took care of my father's house
after my mother passed on.

420
02:41:37,771 --> 02:41:39,648
I'm married and I have a daughter.

421
02:41:40,211 --> 02:41:43,567
This is a big house, but I'm a big woman,
and I can do a good job.

422
02:41:43,651 --> 02:41:47,007
I do not pretend to be an easy woman
to work for.

423
02:41:49,411 --> 02:41:50,844
'"Dolores.'"

424
02:41:54,291 --> 02:41:56,486
This house has a number of rules.

425
02:41:57,251 --> 02:41:59,446
I'm sure you've heard them second-hand.

426
02:41:59,731 --> 02:42:01,687
But I'll tell you in person...

427
02:42:01,891 --> 02:42:04,803
...so we can avoid a teary scene later on.

428
02:42:05,331 --> 02:42:09,244
I like all the windows open every day
for at least two hours...

429
02:42:09,811 --> 02:42:12,450
She did have her ways, did she ever.

430
02:42:13,171 --> 02:42:16,641
I don't know where she got them,
but I know she was a prisoner of them.

431
02:42:16,731 --> 02:42:18,449
The silver has to be checked and...

432
02:42:18,531 --> 02:42:22,490
...cleaned every week. It may look clean
to you, but I like to see my f ace in it.

433
02:42:23,491 --> 02:42:27,325
The tubs had to be scrubbed out every day
with vinegar and baking soda.

434
02:42:27,611 --> 02:42:29,567
Tablecloths, napkins, handkerchiefs...

435
02:42:29,851 --> 02:42:32,160
...everything hand-washed,
ironed and starched.

436
02:42:33,171 --> 02:42:35,401
Mildew was grounds for firing.

437
02:42:35,811 --> 02:42:38,484
The sheets.
Now, that was one thing you didn't...

438
02:42:38,571 --> 02:42:40,368
...ever want to get wrong.

439
02:42:40,451 --> 02:42:42,806
You could've cut off
her high-flown snobbish nose...

440
02:42:42,891 --> 02:42:45,724
...and she'd still smell a sheet
that had hung outside...

441
02:42:45,811 --> 02:42:47,403
...from one baked in the dryer.

442
02:42:48,771 --> 02:42:50,682
Excuse me, Mr. Donovan.

443
02:42:51,091 --> 02:42:53,002
Do you have to do that now?

444
02:42:53,451 --> 02:42:54,600
Talk to the Missus.

445
02:42:54,691 --> 02:42:55,965
Her husband...

446
02:42:56,131 --> 02:42:57,246
...Jack.

447
02:42:57,571 --> 02:42:59,402
He only came up once all summer.

448
02:42:59,571 --> 02:43:01,960
Most of which he spent
ignoring her anyway.

449
02:43:02,451 --> 02:43:05,329
She could've easily had the clothesline
near the house.

450
02:43:05,411 --> 02:43:07,641
But not Vera Donovan. No, ma'am.

451
02:43:07,891 --> 02:43:10,610
She had to have the south wind blowin'
through her linens.

452
02:43:10,771 --> 02:43:14,605
And that meant trampin' up and down
that hill twice a day when it was f air.

453
02:43:17,091 --> 02:43:19,366
Isn't this glorious, Jack?

454
02:43:23,731 --> 02:43:25,449
Six pins, Dolores!

455
02:43:26,131 --> 02:43:28,201
You know that's the way I like it.

456
02:43:28,611 --> 02:43:30,363
Six pins, not five!

457
02:43:33,251 --> 02:43:34,286
Jack?

458
02:43:34,851 --> 02:43:36,284
It's 4:30.

459
02:43:36,611 --> 02:43:38,363
Don't you want a cocktail?

460
02:43:44,611 --> 02:43:47,171
Three square meals of bitchery
all summer long...

461
02:43:47,251 --> 02:43:49,526
...but I kept my head down
and my mouth shut.

462
02:43:49,611 --> 02:43:51,442
Every week that $40 went in the bank.

463
02:43:51,851 --> 02:43:54,046
There wasn't a damn thing
she could say about it.

464
02:43:54,131 --> 02:43:55,166
Thanks a lot.

465
02:43:55,411 --> 02:43:57,402
As much as she crabbed
that whole summer...

466
02:43:57,491 --> 02:44:00,369
...I must have done something right.
Come Labor Day...

467
02:44:01,931 --> 02:44:05,162
I'm sure your winter schedule
is rather hectic...

468
02:44:05,611 --> 02:44:08,648
...but I need someone to touch up
the house once a week.

469
02:44:09,131 --> 02:44:10,200
Dusting.

470
02:44:10,491 --> 02:44:12,049
Keeping the mice company.

471
02:44:12,691 --> 02:44:14,204
I could do that for you.

472
02:44:15,571 --> 02:44:16,720
$12 a week was...

473
02:44:16,811 --> 02:44:18,483
...what I had in mind.

474
02:44:20,771 --> 02:44:21,965
That'd be fine.

475
02:44:23,251 --> 02:44:25,560
I'll see you next Memorial Day.

476
02:44:31,931 --> 02:44:33,842
That winter, Jack Donovan passed on.

477
02:44:34,491 --> 02:44:36,527
He died in a car crash in Maryland.

478
02:44:36,891 --> 02:44:39,246
I wasn't sure what to expect from Vera.

479
02:44:39,491 --> 02:44:41,686
Gorry if she didn't show up in high spirits.

480
02:44:43,091 --> 02:44:45,559
I believe I told you more than once...

481
02:44:45,891 --> 02:44:49,327
...I want the welcome mats
with the letters facing out and not in.

482
02:44:49,571 --> 02:44:50,526
Yes, ma'am.

483
02:44:50,611 --> 02:44:52,363
She'd sold her place in Baltimore.

484
02:44:52,771 --> 02:44:55,001
She was moving up permanent.

485
02:44:55,771 --> 02:44:57,807
Get that out of here and put that there.

486
02:44:57,971 --> 02:45:00,531
And take away this disgusting sofa.

487
02:45:00,691 --> 02:45:03,569
It took two days to load in
her majesty's palace.

488
02:45:03,931 --> 02:45:07,003
She offered me full time and I took it.
I took it.

489
02:45:07,411 --> 02:45:09,322
I knew what kind of hell it would be.

490
02:45:10,291 --> 02:45:13,169
Hell ain't something
you get thrown into overnight.

491
02:45:13,571 --> 02:45:15,766
The real hell comes on you as slow...

492
02:45:15,851 --> 02:45:18,126
...and steady as a line
of wet winter sheets.

493
02:45:18,771 --> 02:45:20,841
Snot leaking off your nose.

494
02:45:21,011 --> 02:45:22,808
Your hands so cold and raw...

495
02:45:22,931 --> 02:45:24,762
...you start wishing they'd go numb.

496
02:45:24,851 --> 02:45:27,240
It's only December.
You know by February...

497
02:45:27,371 --> 02:45:32,047
...the skin's gonna be cracked so bad, it'll
break open and bleed if you clench a fist.

498
02:45:32,211 --> 02:45:33,485
But you go to the next...

499
02:45:33,571 --> 02:45:37,405
...and the next and before you know it,
those sheets stretch out 20 years.

500
02:45:37,491 --> 02:45:39,402
Nobody made you stay there.

501
02:45:39,571 --> 02:45:43,166
-I needed the money.
-Not in the beginning, not $40 a week.

502
02:45:43,411 --> 02:45:45,242
That's when I needed it the most.

503
02:45:45,331 --> 02:45:47,322
Not for me, for you.

504
02:45:47,891 --> 02:45:49,324
That's perfect.

505
02:45:49,491 --> 02:45:50,844
So it's my fault.

506
02:45:51,091 --> 02:45:54,083
You think your father cared
if you ever got off this island?

507
02:45:54,171 --> 02:45:55,729
Here we go.

508
02:45:55,891 --> 02:45:57,244
I put that money...

509
02:45:57,331 --> 02:46:00,129
...every week, I put it away
in your account...

510
02:46:00,291 --> 02:46:01,485
...for school.

511
02:46:01,651 --> 02:46:04,211
To get you out of this place,
once and for all.

512
02:46:05,411 --> 02:46:07,322
Well, it worked like a charm.

513
02:46:07,491 --> 02:46:08,765
Hello, ladies.

514
02:46:10,091 --> 02:46:11,490
A little morning walk?

515
02:46:11,571 --> 02:46:12,526
Nope.

516
02:46:12,611 --> 02:46:16,206
Just packing up the speed boat
so as I can make my big escape.

517
02:46:16,611 --> 02:46:18,522
Something we can help you with?

518
02:46:21,211 --> 02:46:22,610
We need a hair sample.

519
02:46:23,091 --> 02:46:24,126
How was that?

520
02:46:24,211 --> 02:46:27,044
We need a piece of your hair.
We're running some tests.

521
02:46:27,971 --> 02:46:29,802
-Are you now?
-Just a strand.

522
02:46:29,891 --> 02:46:31,722
I think we'll take a pass on that.

523
02:46:31,811 --> 02:46:32,766
Look...

524
02:46:32,851 --> 02:46:34,807
...right now it's voluntary.

525
02:46:34,971 --> 02:46:36,927
I'd appreciate it, is all.

526
02:46:37,091 --> 02:46:38,649
Bring your scissors, did you?

527
02:46:38,771 --> 02:46:40,682
I said we'll pass.

528
02:46:41,571 --> 02:46:43,721
I'll have a warrant here this afternoon.

529
02:46:44,931 --> 02:46:46,205
You want it...

530
02:46:47,011 --> 02:46:48,364
...you cut it.

531
02:46:49,891 --> 02:46:52,200
Actually, I need to pull it.

532
02:46:53,411 --> 02:46:54,730
We need the root.

533
02:47:01,371 --> 02:47:02,599
Go on.

534
02:47:02,691 --> 02:47:04,204
Take what you want.

535
02:47:05,251 --> 02:47:08,084
I ain't doing any beauty pageants
this week.

536
02:47:17,251 --> 02:47:19,003
-Anything else?
-Mother, enough.

537
02:47:19,251 --> 02:47:22,209
We spoke to Sheila Jolander last night.

538
02:47:22,331 --> 02:47:26,449
She said she'd heard you more than once
threaten to kill Vera Donovan.

539
02:47:26,771 --> 02:47:28,124
Is that true?

540
02:47:29,011 --> 02:47:32,287
If she'd come every day not once a week,
she'd have heard more.

541
02:47:32,371 --> 02:47:34,601
-Get in the house.
-Vera, at the end...

542
02:47:34,691 --> 02:47:37,922
...the way she got, it's a wonder
I didn't say it every hour.

543
02:47:39,971 --> 02:47:42,280
You go ahead, Mr. Mackey.

544
02:47:42,531 --> 02:47:44,886
You scribble that down in your pad there.

545
02:47:45,331 --> 02:47:47,049
You make a note on that.

546
02:47:47,211 --> 02:47:50,362
As long as you write down
that saying a thing and doing it...

547
02:47:50,451 --> 02:47:52,282
...are two separate things.

548
02:47:53,651 --> 02:47:55,801
But, your wife probably
already told you that.

549
02:47:55,891 --> 02:47:57,529
Dolores, that's enough.

550
02:48:01,651 --> 02:48:03,084
My wife...

551
02:48:03,651 --> 02:48:05,050
...Ms. Claiborne...

552
02:48:05,331 --> 02:48:08,004
...died 12 years ago of bone cancer.

553
02:48:11,091 --> 02:48:12,888
Natural causes.

554
02:48:16,691 --> 02:48:19,251
Okay, I guess we'll press on here.

555
02:48:26,011 --> 02:48:27,080
Frank.

556
02:48:27,451 --> 02:48:29,248
I want to get into Vera's.

557
02:48:29,411 --> 02:48:32,369
I got things up there I need.
Clothes and my personals.

558
02:48:32,451 --> 02:48:36,046
We can go over tomorrow. We're shipping
out Vera's body this afternoon.

559
02:48:36,211 --> 02:48:37,610
Fine by me.

560
02:48:39,971 --> 02:48:42,280
What the hell did I just see?

561
02:48:43,811 --> 02:48:47,167
That's the last guy in the world
you want to make an enemy out of.

562
02:48:47,731 --> 02:48:50,040
I ain't making one, I'm keeping one.

563
02:48:50,131 --> 02:48:52,599
What is that supposed to mean?

564
02:48:54,611 --> 02:48:57,000
You're gonna tell me
you don't remember him?

565
02:49:02,771 --> 02:49:05,410
That's all well and good, Miss St. George...

566
02:49:05,731 --> 02:49:08,768
...but you told me that at the time
of your father's death...

567
02:49:08,851 --> 02:49:12,400
...you were working as a maid in a hotel
at Jonesport.

568
02:49:13,651 --> 02:49:14,766
Yes.

569
02:49:15,171 --> 02:49:16,126
Well...

570
02:49:16,211 --> 02:49:17,644
...Mrs. Devereaux...

571
02:49:18,691 --> 02:49:20,204
...at the hotel...

572
02:49:21,171 --> 02:49:22,445
Remember?

573
02:49:24,051 --> 02:49:25,643
Mrs. Devereaux said...

574
02:49:25,891 --> 02:49:27,961
...she was surprised to see you.

575
02:49:28,171 --> 02:49:32,483
She said your mom was pretty strict about
not letting you spend the night there.

576
02:49:33,571 --> 02:49:35,004
Isn't that true?

577
02:49:37,011 --> 02:49:38,444
I guess.

578
02:49:42,531 --> 02:49:45,728
So why did she let you stay
on that particular weekend?

579
02:49:51,851 --> 02:49:53,967
Problems at home, perhaps?

580
02:49:55,411 --> 02:49:57,322
Your mom and dad...

581
02:49:57,731 --> 02:49:59,642
...is that a happy situation?

582
02:49:59,811 --> 02:50:01,403
Miss St. George?

583
02:50:01,731 --> 02:50:03,244
The eclipse.

584
02:50:06,851 --> 02:50:09,809
Because of the eclipse, the hotel was full.

585
02:50:10,371 --> 02:50:12,202
So the money...

586
02:50:12,771 --> 02:50:15,331
They said that we'd make twice as much.

587
02:50:18,371 --> 02:50:20,441
So this was all about money?

588
02:50:21,891 --> 02:50:23,643
My mom let me stay.

589
02:50:24,531 --> 02:50:27,250
They said that we'd make twice as much.

590
02:50:28,931 --> 02:50:30,444
So your father...

591
02:50:30,771 --> 02:50:32,762
...that was just a coincidence, was it?

592
02:50:32,851 --> 02:50:35,001
How long are you gonna let this go on?

593
02:50:35,091 --> 02:50:38,367
The sooner she starts telling the truth,
the sooner we'll be done.

594
02:50:38,451 --> 02:50:41,887
If he's out to torture someone,
I'd be happy to get back in the hot seat.

595
02:50:42,131 --> 02:50:46,409
Anybody who accuses me of killing
my husband, go ahead and call me Dolores.

596
02:50:51,491 --> 02:50:54,722
Detective Mackey, you understand,
he's just doing his job.

597
02:50:55,091 --> 02:50:57,127
Trying to turn an accident into a murder?

598
02:50:57,211 --> 02:51:00,760
Making a girl who just lost her father
cry her eyes out every night?

599
02:51:00,851 --> 02:51:04,241
If that's just doing his job then
you'd better put him down for overtime.

600
02:51:04,331 --> 02:51:05,969
All right, let's split them up.

601
02:51:06,931 --> 02:51:08,284
Slow down, John.

602
02:51:08,451 --> 02:51:11,204
Five minutes, alone, without her.

603
02:51:12,451 --> 02:51:13,645
Enough, John.

604
02:51:13,731 --> 02:51:15,403
I only need five minutes!

605
02:51:15,891 --> 02:51:17,244
I said, '"Enough.'"

606
02:51:28,211 --> 02:51:30,850
So don't be talkin' to me
about makin' enemies.

607
02:51:30,931 --> 02:51:32,728
No, sir. No, ma'am.

608
02:51:34,131 --> 02:51:37,646
That son of a bitch has been waitin'
a long time to pick over my bones.

609
02:51:39,651 --> 02:51:40,845
Hand me that ax.

610
02:51:42,411 --> 02:51:45,369
Just look at this window.
Little piss squirts!

611
02:51:45,971 --> 02:51:49,566
I ought to call their parents
and have them come over and pay for it.

612
02:51:50,931 --> 02:51:52,842
Now I gotta go buy glass and...

613
02:51:52,931 --> 02:51:54,922
...putty and God knows what else.

614
02:51:56,371 --> 02:51:59,044
Could have burned down
the whole goddamn house.

615
02:52:05,651 --> 02:52:08,245
I thought the malpractice story
was the most important.

616
02:52:08,331 --> 02:52:10,526
If you'd left the number
I'd have called yesterday.

617
02:52:10,611 --> 02:52:12,363
Yeah, right. Look.

618
02:52:12,451 --> 02:52:14,760
The radiologist I told you about...

619
02:52:14,891 --> 02:52:16,609
...he got cold feet.

620
02:52:16,931 --> 02:52:19,161
But, the intern, Levitt...

621
02:52:19,491 --> 02:52:20,810
...he's a talker.

622
02:52:21,011 --> 02:52:23,571
I thought you were going up there
to see your mother?

623
02:52:23,651 --> 02:52:26,529
It's a small domestic drama up here, Peter.

624
02:52:26,691 --> 02:52:28,124
I can be in Phoenix Tuesday.

625
02:52:28,211 --> 02:52:29,246
It'll be over Monday.

626
02:52:29,331 --> 02:52:31,322
Family things, I've been through it.

627
02:52:31,411 --> 02:52:32,605
They take a lot.

628
02:52:32,691 --> 02:52:35,888
I am telling you, it's not a problem.

629
02:52:36,531 --> 02:52:40,922
We both want me to do this story.
I'm out of here Monday at the latest.

630
02:52:41,411 --> 02:52:42,685
You want a wet dream?

631
02:52:42,771 --> 02:52:45,001
Wait till I tell you what Levitt said.

632
02:52:47,651 --> 02:52:48,925
Are you there?

633
02:52:51,171 --> 02:52:52,923
I gave the piece to Maureen.

634
02:52:56,211 --> 02:53:00,284
Look, I'm sorry. I couldn't wait.
The magazine has to be first on this.

635
02:53:00,371 --> 02:53:02,931
It has nothing to do with you,
you know that.

636
02:53:03,891 --> 02:53:06,166
So, I guess you're fucking Maureen now?

637
02:53:06,291 --> 02:53:08,282
Nice try. Come on, Selena.

638
02:53:08,371 --> 02:53:10,043
You couldn't tell me to my f ace?

639
02:53:10,131 --> 02:53:11,769
Look, I never promised you...

640
02:53:11,971 --> 02:53:13,370
You goddamn pimp.

641
02:53:13,531 --> 02:53:16,204
-Careful.
-I need this story, Peter.

642
02:53:17,171 --> 02:53:19,731
There are other stories, better stories.

643
02:53:19,971 --> 02:53:22,360
Bullshit. This was the one.

644
02:53:23,371 --> 02:53:24,326
It's over.

645
02:53:24,411 --> 02:53:25,924
Selena, it doesn't have to be...

646
02:53:31,891 --> 02:53:33,483
I'll do this again.

647
02:53:47,811 --> 02:53:51,087
Shouldn't you be off somewhere
analyzing my mother's hair?

648
02:53:52,171 --> 02:53:55,402
Well, I was thinking how hard
it must be for you.

649
02:53:56,291 --> 02:53:58,202
Protecting her like this.

650
02:54:00,611 --> 02:54:04,524
She's a hearty soul, isn't she?
Might just live another 50 years.

651
02:54:06,531 --> 02:54:10,809
Next eclipse is due in '96.
If she gets away with it this time...

652
02:54:11,091 --> 02:54:13,764
...she might actually have
another chance to...

653
02:54:14,131 --> 02:54:17,089
...kill again, before she's through.

654
02:54:19,331 --> 02:54:21,891
Is that something you want
on your conscience?

655
02:54:26,851 --> 02:54:28,921
I had a problem with that myself.

656
02:54:31,091 --> 02:54:35,369
You know, we're probably more alike
than you'd care to believe.

657
02:54:39,491 --> 02:54:40,924
We live alone...

658
02:54:41,171 --> 02:54:42,524
...no children.

659
02:54:42,771 --> 02:54:45,649
We have our work.
My cases are my family.

660
02:54:46,051 --> 02:54:50,124
In 30 years, I've handled 86 homicides.
I've closed 85 of them...

661
02:54:51,171 --> 02:54:52,843
...to my satisfaction.

662
02:54:54,451 --> 02:54:56,601
I underestimated your mother.

663
02:54:58,611 --> 02:55:00,044
It won't happen again.

664
02:55:05,731 --> 02:55:08,086
You sent that fax to my office...

665
02:55:09,731 --> 02:55:10,925
...didn't you?

666
02:55:13,331 --> 02:55:15,447
'"For God will bring every work
into judgment...

667
02:55:15,531 --> 02:55:17,726
'"...with every secret thing...

668
02:55:17,891 --> 02:55:20,200
'"...whether it be good or evil.'"

669
02:55:22,131 --> 02:55:23,803
You son of a bitch.

670
02:55:23,971 --> 02:55:26,201
Vera Donovan's on my head.

671
02:55:27,331 --> 02:55:29,162
The next one's on yours.

672
02:55:42,211 --> 02:55:43,724
You know, Selena...

673
02:55:44,851 --> 02:55:46,682
...I can't help remembering...

674
02:55:48,051 --> 02:55:49,962
...you were a wonderful cook.

675
02:55:51,411 --> 02:55:52,287
Please.

676
02:55:52,371 --> 02:55:53,565
You were.

677
02:55:54,931 --> 02:55:56,523
I can't even defrost.

678
02:55:56,691 --> 02:55:59,159
You put supper on the table
three nights out of five.

679
02:55:59,331 --> 02:56:01,242
I was working, I'd come back...

680
02:56:01,571 --> 02:56:04,881
...you'd have the house clean,
homework done and food on the table.

681
02:56:09,731 --> 02:56:12,040
You're just out of practice, that's all.

682
02:56:15,011 --> 02:56:17,809
You'll find someone to look after.
You'll see.

683
02:56:18,051 --> 02:56:19,643
It'll all come back to you.

684
02:56:21,211 --> 02:56:22,644
Someone to look after.

685
02:56:23,651 --> 02:56:25,243
You must have boyfriends.

686
02:56:25,531 --> 02:56:28,523
Beautiful girl like you,
smart and out in the world.

687
02:56:33,971 --> 02:56:35,723
Are you tellin' me there's nobody?

688
02:56:37,571 --> 02:56:39,926
I'm telling you there's a lot of nobodies.

689
02:56:47,811 --> 02:56:49,403
Friggin' yahoos.

690
02:56:50,331 --> 02:56:52,049
Come on out here, Dolores!

691
02:56:54,251 --> 02:56:55,889
Friggin' little bastards.

692
02:56:56,011 --> 02:56:59,401
Get off the island,
you goddamn murdering bitch!

693
02:56:59,571 --> 02:57:02,688
Come on down here,
you little ass-picking squirts.

694
02:57:02,771 --> 02:57:05,968
How many people are you gonna kill
before they put you away?

695
02:57:06,611 --> 02:57:09,648
Come on! Come on, you little chickens!

696
02:57:09,811 --> 02:57:11,449
Going to jail this time!

697
02:57:12,171 --> 02:57:13,729
I know who you are.

698
02:57:13,891 --> 02:57:17,327
Chester Lavelier and the rest of you.
Come on down here.

699
02:57:17,411 --> 02:57:19,163
You got something to say to me?

700
02:57:19,251 --> 02:57:21,481
They're gonna put you in the chair!

701
02:57:46,771 --> 02:57:48,204
What are you doin'?

702
02:57:50,451 --> 02:57:52,043
What does it look like?

703
02:57:52,131 --> 02:57:54,440
Selena, you've been drinkin'.

704
02:57:54,931 --> 02:57:56,364
No shit.

705
02:57:56,931 --> 02:57:58,603
I wish you wouldn't.

706
02:57:59,811 --> 02:58:01,164
Look at me.

707
02:58:01,651 --> 02:58:04,370
Look at me. You see how I am right now?

708
02:58:07,131 --> 02:58:08,883
What good is that gonna do?

709
02:58:09,371 --> 02:58:11,089
Because in 10 minutes...

710
02:58:11,171 --> 02:58:13,082
...I'm going to be fine.

711
02:58:13,931 --> 02:58:15,922
Just give me 10 minutes.

712
02:58:23,331 --> 02:58:25,447
Just give me 10 minutes!

713
02:58:30,451 --> 02:58:31,645
God!

714
02:58:39,891 --> 02:58:41,324
I saw your f ather last night.

715
02:58:41,411 --> 02:58:43,879
Did you help your ma kill your dad?

716
02:58:44,571 --> 02:58:45,560
Murderer!

717
02:58:51,411 --> 02:58:52,526
Who is this?

718
02:58:52,851 --> 02:58:54,045
You f at, ugly cow!

719
02:58:54,131 --> 02:58:58,443
When I find out who this is, I'll hang
your privates from Battiscan Light!

720
02:58:58,611 --> 02:58:59,885
Selena, stop that!

721
02:59:01,371 --> 02:59:03,362
Honey, it's gonna be all right.

722
02:59:03,571 --> 02:59:04,686
It won't.

723
02:59:07,091 --> 02:59:09,730
-My God!
-Get away!

724
02:59:17,771 --> 02:59:19,170
It was a bad patch.

725
02:59:20,051 --> 02:59:23,646
You had a bad patch,
and now you're feeling it all over again.

726
02:59:23,731 --> 02:59:25,449
Bad patch?

727
02:59:26,211 --> 02:59:28,850
I had a fucking nervous breakdown,
Mother.

728
02:59:29,011 --> 02:59:30,683
Don't say words like that.

729
02:59:31,891 --> 02:59:34,325
It was a hard time. You got through it.

730
02:59:35,211 --> 02:59:37,805
Oh, what am I doing?

731
02:59:39,851 --> 02:59:41,921
You just needed a rest, that's all.

732
02:59:42,011 --> 02:59:44,206
You snapped out of it just fine.

733
02:59:48,211 --> 02:59:49,849
You can't have one of those...

734
02:59:49,931 --> 02:59:52,923
...and get a full scholarship
to Vassar College.

735
02:59:53,451 --> 02:59:54,850
It was just a bad patch.

736
02:59:55,171 --> 02:59:57,969
I must have been out of my mind
to come back here.

737
03:00:07,371 --> 03:00:09,407
Here! Over here!

738
03:00:10,291 --> 03:00:12,043
What did you do to him?

739
03:00:12,131 --> 03:00:14,008
Nothing, baby. I promise.

740
03:00:14,491 --> 03:00:15,685
Shit! Look at this!

741
03:00:31,811 --> 03:00:33,130
Fuck!

742
03:00:33,331 --> 03:00:34,923
Goddamn it!

743
03:01:00,571 --> 03:01:02,960
Selena, let me take these from you here.

744
03:01:03,731 --> 03:01:05,642
Dolores, I'll take you upstairs.

745
03:01:05,931 --> 03:01:07,330
I'm gonna ask you to...

746
03:01:07,451 --> 03:01:09,806
...step very carefully on the way up.

747
03:01:09,971 --> 03:01:12,201
Still taking blood samples here.

748
03:01:12,491 --> 03:01:14,402
If you feel more comfortable...

749
03:01:14,491 --> 03:01:16,846
...you can always use the back stairs.

750
03:01:23,571 --> 03:01:27,359
John, is it all right if we go upstairs
and get her things?

751
03:01:27,451 --> 03:01:28,804
Go on.

752
03:01:29,291 --> 03:01:30,610
I'm sorry.

753
03:01:37,331 --> 03:01:40,129
He got a search warrant, so...

754
03:01:40,891 --> 03:01:44,042
...had to go through it for evidence. Yep.

755
03:01:44,771 --> 03:01:46,284
It's pretty routine.

756
03:01:46,611 --> 03:01:48,602
Okay, let's get this over with.

757
03:01:50,571 --> 03:01:51,970
So...

758
03:01:52,331 --> 03:01:55,084
You can pack up and take anything
that's not...

759
03:01:55,331 --> 03:01:57,128
...bagged or tagged.

760
03:01:57,251 --> 03:01:59,162
I know that doesn't leave much.

761
03:02:00,051 --> 03:02:01,040
Sorry, Dolores.

762
03:02:04,451 --> 03:02:06,601
I'll give you a hand here.

763
03:02:23,651 --> 03:02:25,004
Dolores, is that it then?

764
03:02:25,171 --> 03:02:27,731
No. I got something in Vera's room.

765
03:02:27,891 --> 03:02:29,768
This room's off-limits.

766
03:02:34,091 --> 03:02:36,207
I'm still going through things here.

767
03:02:39,571 --> 03:02:41,163
Ms. Claiborne.

768
03:02:42,531 --> 03:02:43,566
What's this then?

769
03:02:43,771 --> 03:02:45,602
It's my scrapbook.

770
03:02:46,091 --> 03:02:47,729
It's Selena's articles.

771
03:02:48,531 --> 03:02:50,123
I'd read them to Vera.

772
03:02:56,771 --> 03:02:58,682
Almost got away with it, didn't she?

773
03:03:06,451 --> 03:03:08,681
I read that. That's good stuff.

774
03:03:08,851 --> 03:03:11,240
You really got him to open up there.

775
03:03:13,491 --> 03:03:14,890
Scholarship.

776
03:03:15,171 --> 03:03:16,445
Vassar.

777
03:03:16,531 --> 03:03:18,442
Very impressive.

778
03:03:37,371 --> 03:03:39,089
Jeezly crow.

779
03:03:43,971 --> 03:03:45,609
Couldn't you clean up after her?

780
03:03:45,691 --> 03:03:48,046
-What kind of people are you?
-You put that back!

781
03:03:48,331 --> 03:03:50,083
You'll tell me this is evidence?

782
03:03:50,171 --> 03:03:53,368
-That's exactly what I'm telling you.
-Dolores, you put that down.

783
03:03:55,891 --> 03:03:57,119
Goddamn it!

784
03:03:57,371 --> 03:04:00,522
I'm tryin' to do you a favor here
and that's the way you act?

785
03:04:01,011 --> 03:04:04,321
I ain't leavin' here without my scrapbook.

786
03:04:06,531 --> 03:04:07,964
Sorry, John.

787
03:04:11,051 --> 03:04:14,043
I'll see you day after tomorrow,
9:00 a.m. at the town hall.

788
03:04:14,211 --> 03:04:16,850
Don't put your fur up, Frank. I'll be there.

789
03:04:18,371 --> 03:04:21,488
I have a feeling we could wrap this up
right now.

790
03:04:21,731 --> 03:04:23,722
It's not gonna be like last time.

791
03:04:27,011 --> 03:04:28,046
Is that so?

792
03:04:28,251 --> 03:04:30,287
Let's just go. Okay?

793
03:04:31,971 --> 03:04:35,646
Now you listen to me, Mister Grand High
Poobah of Upper Butt Crack.

794
03:04:35,811 --> 03:04:38,848
I'm just about half past give a shit
with your fun and games.

795
03:04:38,931 --> 03:04:42,810
My husband's death was ruled an accident
and you know it better than anyone.

796
03:04:42,931 --> 03:04:46,082
'"Death by misadventure,'" to be exact.

797
03:04:46,291 --> 03:04:48,361
I'm sure there's people who'd tell you...

798
03:04:48,451 --> 03:04:50,567
...I had plenty of reasons to kill Joe.

799
03:04:50,651 --> 03:04:52,846
But Vera, why the hell would I kill her?

800
03:04:53,291 --> 03:04:55,043
All I am is out of a job...

801
03:04:55,451 --> 03:04:56,884
...a nice room to sleep in.

802
03:04:57,171 --> 03:04:59,446
You don't need a job, do you?

803
03:05:00,291 --> 03:05:01,485
Motive?

804
03:05:02,451 --> 03:05:06,729
I'd say $1,600,000...

805
03:05:06,851 --> 03:05:08,284
...is quite a motive.

806
03:05:08,851 --> 03:05:09,806
What?

807
03:05:09,891 --> 03:05:11,927
Your mother's a wealthy woman, Selena.

808
03:05:16,131 --> 03:05:18,042
What the hell are you talkin' about?

809
03:05:18,131 --> 03:05:20,929
I spoke to Vera's lawyer
in Baltimore last night.

810
03:05:21,011 --> 03:05:21,887
John.

811
03:05:21,971 --> 03:05:24,121
-She left you everything.
-Look, John...

812
03:05:24,251 --> 03:05:25,809
Every last cent.

813
03:05:27,891 --> 03:05:29,802
She can't do that.

814
03:05:31,731 --> 03:05:32,925
You're lyin'.

815
03:05:33,011 --> 03:05:34,922
You're a millionaire, Ms. Claiborne.

816
03:05:35,331 --> 03:05:36,525
Wait a minute.

817
03:05:36,851 --> 03:05:39,888
-This isn't the place to be bringing...
-Back off.

818
03:05:40,331 --> 03:05:41,684
He's crazy.

819
03:05:42,611 --> 03:05:44,203
That's plain crazy.

820
03:05:46,771 --> 03:05:48,602
She'd never do that.

821
03:05:48,691 --> 03:05:51,205
Did she keep it a secret
from you, too, Selena?

822
03:05:51,491 --> 03:05:53,641
Or maybe you knew about it.

823
03:05:54,291 --> 03:05:56,043
Because this will...

824
03:05:56,771 --> 03:05:58,124
I mean, hell...

825
03:05:58,251 --> 03:06:00,685
...it's only eight years old.

826
03:06:02,611 --> 03:06:03,566
Frank!

827
03:06:05,691 --> 03:06:08,524
You want to wait for the District Attorney
Monday morning?

828
03:06:08,611 --> 03:06:10,920
Or should we take care of this now?

829
03:06:22,731 --> 03:06:24,289
Get in the car, Mother.

830
03:06:26,691 --> 03:06:29,330
Get in the goddamn car!

831
03:06:40,691 --> 03:06:42,761
You had no idea she left you the money?

832
03:06:43,291 --> 03:06:44,326
I swear it.

833
03:06:44,691 --> 03:06:46,921
Over $1,000,000.

834
03:06:47,051 --> 03:06:50,248
That bitch. The malicious,
high-flown, harpin' bitch!

835
03:06:50,331 --> 03:06:51,923
Cut the bullshit!

836
03:06:53,771 --> 03:06:55,523
You can afford a lawyer now.

837
03:07:01,971 --> 03:07:03,086
Car trouble?

838
03:07:03,291 --> 03:07:05,805
We're quite fine, thank you.

839
03:07:09,011 --> 03:07:10,683
I wish I had killed her.

840
03:07:11,891 --> 03:07:13,483
Leavin' me that money.

841
03:07:14,451 --> 03:07:16,328
I wish I had!

842
03:07:17,931 --> 03:07:19,728
I wish I had killed her!

843
03:07:31,491 --> 03:07:33,607
What happened in that house?

844
03:07:38,691 --> 03:07:40,124
Dolores.

845
03:07:48,371 --> 03:07:50,123
Hell's bells.

846
03:07:52,211 --> 03:07:53,439
Look who's up.

847
03:07:59,491 --> 03:08:01,482
I'm wet.

848
03:08:02,931 --> 03:08:04,330
What else is new?

849
03:08:04,451 --> 03:08:06,760
How long this time?

850
03:08:07,571 --> 03:08:10,324
Since you last made sense?
About two days, I guess.

851
03:08:10,571 --> 03:08:14,246
Just leave me wet, don't you?

852
03:08:15,091 --> 03:08:18,561
When I'm not thinking straight enough
to keep on you.

853
03:08:20,884 --> 03:08:22,795
That's what you do...

854
03:08:22,964 --> 03:08:24,238
...isn't it?

855
03:08:24,324 --> 03:08:28,158
Yeah, it's a regular party around here
when you're snoozin'.

856
03:08:28,884 --> 03:08:31,239
Where's my china pig?

857
03:08:31,604 --> 03:08:34,801
There's only 200 of them around.
Which one you want?

858
03:08:35,284 --> 03:08:38,162
Are you being smart?

859
03:08:38,364 --> 03:08:42,073
No, Vera. If I'd been smart, I'd have done
workin' for you a long time ago.

860
03:08:42,164 --> 03:08:44,553
Let's see what you got left.

861
03:08:46,004 --> 03:08:49,235
Goddamn it! Are you gonna sit here
and marinate in it? Come on.

862
03:08:51,684 --> 03:08:54,596
You're gonna get on this fanny pan
one way or another.

863
03:08:54,764 --> 03:08:55,913
Come on.

864
03:08:57,444 --> 03:08:58,877
There we go.

865
03:09:00,884 --> 03:09:03,398
Your chariot awaits, Your Highness.

866
03:09:06,644 --> 03:09:08,680
Now hold on with your good arm.

867
03:09:08,804 --> 03:09:10,556
Hold on this time.

868
03:09:10,644 --> 03:09:12,396
Push with your good leg.

869
03:09:13,004 --> 03:09:15,677
I don't know why you make me do this.

870
03:09:19,404 --> 03:09:21,759
I hate this nightgown.

871
03:09:23,204 --> 03:09:26,241
Your days of silk and satin are over, Vera.

872
03:09:26,764 --> 03:09:29,119
From now on it's wash 'n' wear.

873
03:09:34,164 --> 03:09:35,802
You're poisoning me...

874
03:09:35,884 --> 03:09:37,556
...aren't you, Dolores?

875
03:09:37,884 --> 03:09:39,203
Slow...

876
03:09:39,284 --> 03:09:40,637
...but sure.

877
03:09:40,724 --> 03:09:42,521
That's what you're doing.

878
03:09:42,804 --> 03:09:44,032
No, ma'am.

879
03:09:44,164 --> 03:09:46,962
When I'm ready to settle your hash,
I won't use poison.

880
03:09:47,044 --> 03:09:51,435
I'll just shove you out the window. There'll
be one less smelly bitch in the world.

881
03:09:56,604 --> 03:09:58,720
Don't we have a hair...

882
03:09:58,804 --> 03:10:01,602
...across our ass today.

883
03:10:01,684 --> 03:10:03,914
Dolores Claiborne.

884
03:10:07,604 --> 03:10:09,640
I want my china pig!

885
03:10:10,044 --> 03:10:12,319
Get off your royal duff and go and get it.

886
03:10:12,404 --> 03:10:14,235
We both know you can do it.

887
03:10:14,324 --> 03:10:15,439
Do you good.

888
03:10:15,604 --> 03:10:16,639
You need the exercise.

889
03:10:16,724 --> 03:10:18,316
What I need...

890
03:10:18,724 --> 03:10:22,399
...is someone who'll do as they're told!

891
03:10:23,044 --> 03:10:24,477
Don't go too far, Vera.

892
03:10:24,724 --> 03:10:27,113
I'll go as far...

893
03:10:28,004 --> 03:10:30,564
...as I damn well want!

894
03:10:31,884 --> 03:10:33,033
Yes.

895
03:10:33,564 --> 03:10:34,792
I will!

896
03:10:39,404 --> 03:10:40,883
If this...

897
03:10:41,284 --> 03:10:44,674
...is what's going to pass as living...

898
03:10:46,004 --> 03:10:49,997
...I'll damn well say what I want!

899
03:10:50,164 --> 03:10:52,883
'"Oh, this little piggy had champagne.

900
03:10:53,124 --> 03:10:55,001
'"This little piggy ate beans.'"

901
03:10:55,084 --> 03:10:57,473
I'll fix you some tea. You'll feel better.

902
03:10:57,684 --> 03:10:58,958
No!

903
03:10:59,044 --> 03:11:00,636
I won't.

904
03:11:03,364 --> 03:11:05,798
I won't feel better.

905
03:11:06,564 --> 03:11:08,555
I never will.

906
03:11:09,124 --> 03:11:12,161
I'll never feel better again.

907
03:12:14,964 --> 03:12:16,636
Oh, my God.

908
03:12:39,484 --> 03:12:41,361
What the hell are you doing?

909
03:12:43,444 --> 03:12:45,674
Get out of my way, Dolores.

910
03:12:46,164 --> 03:12:48,234
Where do you think you're going?

911
03:12:50,564 --> 03:12:52,714
What in God's name has gotten into you?

912
03:12:54,164 --> 03:12:56,678
Let go of me, Dolores!

913
03:12:59,844 --> 03:13:01,402
Leave me go!

914
03:13:18,604 --> 03:13:19,593
Oh, my God!

915
03:13:24,564 --> 03:13:26,043
Oh, my God.

916
03:13:27,244 --> 03:13:28,563
Don't try to talk.

917
03:13:29,444 --> 03:13:31,082
I'm going to go call the doctor.

918
03:13:31,324 --> 03:13:33,042
No doctor.

919
03:13:33,244 --> 03:13:34,313
No hospital.

920
03:13:34,444 --> 03:13:36,275
You're gonna be all right, Vera.

921
03:13:36,724 --> 03:13:39,682
You just lie still, don't move.

922
03:13:40,004 --> 03:13:41,676
You're gonna be fine.

923
03:13:43,444 --> 03:13:46,959
Dolores Claiborne says I'm gonna be fine.

924
03:13:47,804 --> 03:13:49,681
What a relief it is...

925
03:13:49,844 --> 03:13:52,642
...to have a professional opinion.

926
03:13:53,524 --> 03:13:55,037
Why?

927
03:13:55,604 --> 03:13:57,674
Why'd you do this, Vera?

928
03:13:57,844 --> 03:14:00,039
-Why?
-Because...

929
03:14:00,164 --> 03:14:01,677
...I hate...

930
03:14:02,164 --> 03:14:04,758
...the smell of being old.

931
03:14:05,644 --> 03:14:07,362
I'm tired...

932
03:14:07,524 --> 03:14:09,674
...and I want to be done.

933
03:14:11,284 --> 03:14:13,752
Will you help me, Dolores?

934
03:14:14,884 --> 03:14:17,159
Will you please...

935
03:14:17,924 --> 03:14:19,755
...help me die?

936
03:14:20,884 --> 03:14:24,513
Don't let me die in some hospital.

937
03:14:25,524 --> 03:14:27,037
Kill me now.

938
03:14:45,924 --> 03:14:48,996
If you really want to help me...

939
03:14:50,244 --> 03:14:52,394
...please hurry.

940
03:14:54,764 --> 03:14:57,278
Dolores, got a certified letter here.

941
03:15:03,684 --> 03:15:05,595
You don't believe me, do you?

942
03:15:06,724 --> 03:15:08,680
You think I killed her.

943
03:15:09,004 --> 03:15:11,279
What I think doesn't mean shit.

944
03:15:12,724 --> 03:15:15,716
It's the rest of the world
you better start worrying about.

945
03:15:32,284 --> 03:15:34,400
I made a list of attorneys.

946
03:15:36,324 --> 03:15:38,633
These are all the big muscle firms
in New York.

947
03:15:38,804 --> 03:15:41,318
It could take a couple of days,
that's why on Monday...

948
03:15:41,404 --> 03:15:43,713
...you're not gonna say a word.

949
03:15:45,684 --> 03:15:46,799
Take it.

950
03:16:03,524 --> 03:16:06,197
In case you missed it,
I'm trying to help you.

951
03:16:06,844 --> 03:16:10,200
You think I give a fiddler's fuck
what anybody else says about me?

952
03:16:10,444 --> 03:16:11,877
Oh, Jesus.

953
03:16:12,044 --> 03:16:13,318
It's you.

954
03:16:13,484 --> 03:16:16,044
What you think is the only thing left
that's important.

955
03:16:16,164 --> 03:16:18,120
I can't send you to prison.

956
03:16:18,804 --> 03:16:20,874
You think that's the end of the world?

957
03:16:21,204 --> 03:16:23,081
Gorry, that'd be a relief.

958
03:16:23,284 --> 03:16:24,717
Sit and sleep...

959
03:16:25,004 --> 03:16:26,403
...three meals served every day.

960
03:16:26,484 --> 03:16:29,123
Maybe you're just happier being miserable.
Is that it?

961
03:16:29,724 --> 03:16:30,839
Is that it, Mother?

962
03:16:32,204 --> 03:16:33,842
If it makes it easier for you.

963
03:16:34,044 --> 03:16:37,957
Vera's a bitch. She's abusive,
she's mean, she's cheap.

964
03:16:38,444 --> 03:16:39,513
Why not leave?

965
03:16:39,684 --> 03:16:41,276
Why not just walk?

966
03:16:41,364 --> 03:16:42,956
Like they do in New York?

967
03:16:44,044 --> 03:16:45,557
Someone hurts me...

968
03:16:45,964 --> 03:16:47,283
...I leave.

969
03:16:47,564 --> 03:16:50,397
Believe me, I learned that long
before I got to New York.

970
03:16:51,804 --> 03:16:53,681
I'm not the one that hurt you.

971
03:16:54,204 --> 03:16:56,718
What is that supposed to mean?

972
03:16:58,164 --> 03:16:59,756
You're blaming him?

973
03:17:00,084 --> 03:17:02,154
Is that what we're into now?

974
03:17:03,284 --> 03:17:04,876
He was a drunk.

975
03:17:05,444 --> 03:17:07,639
Barely got out of his own way.

976
03:17:09,044 --> 03:17:09,999
Fine...

977
03:17:10,164 --> 03:17:11,882
...maybe he hit you.

978
03:17:12,044 --> 03:17:13,682
I don't remember it.

979
03:17:14,524 --> 03:17:16,674
You don't seem to remember
much of anything.

980
03:17:16,764 --> 03:17:19,961
But then, he's not exactly around
to defend himself, is he?

981
03:17:25,884 --> 03:17:28,478
You honest to God don't remember,
do you?

982
03:17:30,964 --> 03:17:32,192
Look.

983
03:17:35,724 --> 03:17:37,521
Here's the goddamn list.

984
03:17:38,284 --> 03:17:39,956
You do what you want with it.

985
03:17:40,044 --> 03:17:41,921
That's why you're so unsettled, ain't it?

986
03:17:42,004 --> 03:17:43,278
Unsettled?

987
03:17:43,644 --> 03:17:46,033
Don't you mean '"boogery,'" Mother?

988
03:17:46,644 --> 03:17:48,714
If you're attempting
a meaningful analysis...

989
03:17:48,804 --> 03:17:50,681
...perhaps we'd best define our terms.

990
03:17:50,844 --> 03:17:52,914
A cornerstone of critical thinking...

991
03:17:53,004 --> 03:17:55,074
...is communicating
with an agreed vocabulary.

992
03:17:55,164 --> 03:17:56,643
Go have another drink.

993
03:17:56,764 --> 03:17:59,119
No, I've had my fun for the night.

994
03:18:01,764 --> 03:18:06,315
You sit down right this minute
and you can just stow that Vassar shit.

995
03:18:12,924 --> 03:18:15,392
We're gonna sit down at this table,
you and me...

996
03:18:15,924 --> 03:18:17,277
...and we're gonna have a drink.

997
03:18:17,364 --> 03:18:19,002
When we're through...

998
03:18:19,084 --> 03:18:20,233
When I'm through...

999
03:18:20,404 --> 03:18:25,034
...you can run upstairs and take whichever
of those little pills makes you feel the best.

1000
03:18:41,764 --> 03:18:43,914
Don't say a goddamn word.

1001
03:18:47,644 --> 03:18:49,919
Before you get too deep in that
to make sense...

1002
03:18:50,004 --> 03:18:51,995
...take a look at her report card.

1003
03:18:52,204 --> 03:18:53,603
I saw it.

1004
03:18:54,324 --> 03:18:55,439
So what?

1005
03:18:56,204 --> 03:18:58,001
Everybody slips now and then.

1006
03:18:58,124 --> 03:18:59,273
Can I be excused?

1007
03:18:59,404 --> 03:19:01,281
Not till you say how an honor student...

1008
03:19:01,364 --> 03:19:03,036
...who skips the seventh grade...

1009
03:19:03,124 --> 03:19:06,719
...goes from straight A's to C's and D's
in two semesters.

1010
03:19:06,804 --> 03:19:08,522
Will you leave her alone already?

1011
03:19:08,604 --> 03:19:11,277
It's not like you were some great genius
at school.

1012
03:19:12,564 --> 03:19:16,352
No Claiborne wasn't even born
in a hospital, for chrissake.

1013
03:19:16,524 --> 03:19:18,116
May I please be excused?

1014
03:19:18,204 --> 03:19:19,523
No, you may not.

1015
03:19:19,724 --> 03:19:21,840
Yes, you may. Go right ahead, dear.

1016
03:19:27,964 --> 03:19:29,238
Thanks a lot.

1017
03:19:29,364 --> 03:19:31,116
You better learn to stow it.

1018
03:19:31,204 --> 03:19:33,081
You'll drive her right out the door.

1019
03:19:45,964 --> 03:19:48,080
Mom, what are you doing here?

1020
03:19:48,164 --> 03:19:52,157
Thought you and I might ride back
on the ferry together. You mind company?

1021
03:19:59,604 --> 03:20:01,196
Beautiful, ain't it?

1022
03:20:04,564 --> 03:20:06,953
You used to be beautiful too.

1023
03:20:08,724 --> 03:20:10,521
Why ain't you anymore?

1024
03:20:12,724 --> 03:20:15,238
When was the last time
you washed your hair?

1025
03:20:23,764 --> 03:20:25,482
It's drugs, ain't it?

1026
03:20:27,124 --> 03:20:28,682
You've changed.

1027
03:20:29,524 --> 03:20:31,355
You're 13 years old, you're smoking pot.

1028
03:20:31,444 --> 03:20:33,639
Where do you get it?
How long's it been going on?

1029
03:20:33,724 --> 03:20:35,123
I don't do drugs, Mother.

1030
03:20:37,964 --> 03:20:41,195
Whatever trouble you're in
won't change my love for you.

1031
03:20:41,524 --> 03:20:44,960
I can't begin to help you out of it
till you tell me the truth.

1032
03:20:47,404 --> 03:20:48,837
Are you pregnant?

1033
03:20:49,004 --> 03:20:50,483
Get real.

1034
03:20:50,644 --> 03:20:53,716
You want to end up like me?
Dumb and stuck?

1035
03:20:53,924 --> 03:20:56,597
Think I push you so hard
in school to stay in a uniform...

1036
03:20:56,684 --> 03:20:59,676
...and clean up after people forever?
Is that what you want?

1037
03:20:59,764 --> 03:21:01,197
I'm not pregnant.

1038
03:21:01,444 --> 03:21:02,593
Then...

1039
03:21:02,844 --> 03:21:05,153
What is it?
What the hell's going on with you?

1040
03:21:05,244 --> 03:21:07,314
-Leave me alone.
-I won't leave you alone.

1041
03:21:07,404 --> 03:21:10,077
We'll ride the ferry all day till you say...

1042
03:21:10,164 --> 03:21:11,040
...what's wrong.

1043
03:21:11,124 --> 03:21:12,034
Leave me be!

1044
03:21:12,124 --> 03:21:14,513
-Why won't you talk to me?
-Don't touch me!

1045
03:21:14,604 --> 03:21:15,480
What?

1046
03:21:15,564 --> 03:21:17,043
Stop it!

1047
03:21:17,884 --> 03:21:19,158
I got you.

1048
03:21:20,044 --> 03:21:21,636
Get off of me!

1049
03:21:21,924 --> 03:21:24,074
What is the matter with you?

1050
03:21:24,524 --> 03:21:26,003
Talk to me!

1051
03:21:27,604 --> 03:21:29,322
Where did you get this?

1052
03:21:29,644 --> 03:21:31,077
What're you doin'?

1053
03:21:31,284 --> 03:21:33,593
This is your grandma St. George's cameo.

1054
03:21:34,204 --> 03:21:35,683
-It's mine.
-What did you do?

1055
03:21:35,764 --> 03:21:37,277
Did you go in your father's closet?

1056
03:21:37,364 --> 03:21:38,399
Mom, please...

1057
03:21:38,484 --> 03:21:42,159
-Selena, did you steal this?
-No! It's mine.

1058
03:21:49,684 --> 03:21:50,878
Oh, my God.

1059
03:22:21,804 --> 03:22:24,193
As you can see, Mrs. St. George...

1060
03:22:25,684 --> 03:22:28,403
...this account's been closed out
by your husband.

1061
03:22:28,524 --> 03:22:30,003
How can that be?

1062
03:22:30,964 --> 03:22:35,116
That's my life savings. How can that be
when I got the passbook right here?

1063
03:22:35,284 --> 03:22:37,240
You see, Mrs. St. George, that is...

1064
03:22:37,524 --> 03:22:40,561
...was what we call
a custodial savings account.

1065
03:22:40,844 --> 03:22:44,519
That means either parent
can countersign and make a withdrawal.

1066
03:22:45,844 --> 03:22:47,960
This doesn't show any withdrawals.

1067
03:22:48,444 --> 03:22:51,038
How'd he get the money
without the goddamn passbook?

1068
03:22:51,244 --> 03:22:52,836
Mrs. St. George...

1069
03:22:53,044 --> 03:22:55,604
...if I could ask you
to keep your voice down.

1070
03:22:57,364 --> 03:23:01,198
According to this, your husband stated,
'"Passbook was lost.'"

1071
03:23:02,484 --> 03:23:04,440
He asked to be issued a new one.

1072
03:23:04,564 --> 03:23:05,883
It's common enough.

1073
03:23:05,964 --> 03:23:08,524
Common be damned.
I opened this account!

1074
03:23:08,684 --> 03:23:11,357
Who do you think put the money
in the bank to begin with?

1075
03:23:11,444 --> 03:23:13,400
Please, Mrs. St. George.

1076
03:23:14,084 --> 03:23:17,156
I'm sorry, but I assure you
what we did was not only legal...

1077
03:23:17,444 --> 03:23:19,241
...but standard bank practice.

1078
03:23:19,324 --> 03:23:21,280
Maybe it's legal and maybe it ain't.

1079
03:23:21,364 --> 03:23:24,197
I can't believe standard practice
means you don't make...

1080
03:23:24,284 --> 03:23:26,195
...one single goddamn phone call...

1081
03:23:26,284 --> 03:23:28,593
...to the person whose name
is on the account.

1082
03:23:28,684 --> 03:23:30,242
I'm very sorry...

1083
03:23:30,324 --> 03:23:34,636
Say you're sorry again, I'll kick your butt
till you look like a hunchback.

1084
03:23:37,844 --> 03:23:38,560
Lydia.

1085
03:23:48,564 --> 03:23:50,634
It's 'cause I'm a woman, ain't it?

1086
03:23:52,884 --> 03:23:56,797
If I'd been the one passing off a fairy story
how I'd lost the passbook...

1087
03:23:56,884 --> 03:23:58,397
...and asked for a new one...

1088
03:23:58,484 --> 03:24:02,443
If I'd been the one who started drawing out
what took 11 years to put in...

1089
03:24:03,084 --> 03:24:04,881
...you would have called Joe.

1090
03:24:12,204 --> 03:24:13,193
Well...

1091
03:24:14,484 --> 03:24:16,202
I suppose it's one of two things.

1092
03:24:16,284 --> 03:24:19,356
Either he's buried it in a mason jar
in the backyard, or else...

1093
03:24:20,404 --> 03:24:22,235
...he opened up a new account.

1094
03:24:27,924 --> 03:24:29,152
Mr. Pease...

1095
03:24:30,804 --> 03:24:33,955
You don't have to tell me,
but I hope you'll think for a moment...

1096
03:24:34,044 --> 03:24:38,322
...about the grief and heartache you could
have saved me by making just one call.

1097
03:24:41,044 --> 03:24:45,083
I'm asking you to please tell me
whether he's opened a new account here...

1098
03:24:45,484 --> 03:24:48,317
...or if I've gotta start digging holes
around my house.

1099
03:24:54,484 --> 03:24:58,523
As soon as the luncheon silver is clean,
I want the guest rooms aired out.

1100
03:24:58,964 --> 03:25:03,116
I'll want to go over the linens
for the daybeds in the study...

1101
03:25:03,564 --> 03:25:04,599
...and the sun room.

1102
03:25:04,684 --> 03:25:07,517
No, Joy, I don't like those colors together.
Change them.

1103
03:25:07,604 --> 03:25:10,641
Dolores, did you check on the flowers?

1104
03:25:11,084 --> 03:25:14,156
Must you look so trod-upon, Dolores?

1105
03:25:14,284 --> 03:25:17,993
In 36 hours you will have
the uniquely thrilling experience...

1106
03:25:18,084 --> 03:25:20,837
...of standing at the epicenter
of a total solar eclipse.

1107
03:25:21,204 --> 03:25:25,197
I've got guests traveling 800 miles
for something all you need to do is look...

1108
03:25:34,964 --> 03:25:36,556
Did you see Dolores?

1109
03:25:38,604 --> 03:25:43,394
As soon as the caterers arrive, I want you
to make sure they have everything needed.

1110
03:25:43,604 --> 03:25:44,957
I've made a list.

1111
03:25:45,204 --> 03:25:48,480
I want no last-minute frantic runs
to Jonesport.

1112
03:25:49,404 --> 03:25:50,962
Do you hear me?

1113
03:25:55,764 --> 03:25:57,800
Would you put on some tea?

1114
03:26:09,524 --> 03:26:13,642
-Are we quite finished?
-I'm sorry, Mrs. Donovan. I truly am.

1115
03:26:13,724 --> 03:26:14,839
'"Vera.'"

1116
03:26:17,324 --> 03:26:20,122
I insist all women who have hysterics
in my drawing room...

1117
03:26:20,204 --> 03:26:21,956
...call me by my Christian name.

1118
03:26:26,084 --> 03:26:28,598
So, enlighten me, Dolores.

1119
03:26:30,124 --> 03:26:34,640
What turns a stone-hard woman like you
into the blubbering mess I see before me?

1120
03:26:38,644 --> 03:26:40,555
Joe stole my money.

1121
03:26:42,044 --> 03:26:44,353
I went to close out my account...

1122
03:26:44,764 --> 03:26:46,880
It was money I'd been saving for Selena.

1123
03:26:47,804 --> 03:26:51,797
$3,000. I went to get it out
and it was gone.

1124
03:26:53,684 --> 03:26:55,720
Well, don't look to me, Dolores.

1125
03:26:55,884 --> 03:26:57,840
All my money's tied up in cash.

1126
03:27:01,884 --> 03:27:04,159
Planning on playing the stock market,
were you?

1127
03:27:04,244 --> 03:27:05,723
I was going to leave.

1128
03:27:07,764 --> 03:27:11,882
I was going to take Selena away with me
tonight before he gets back.

1129
03:27:16,044 --> 03:27:17,033
Well...

1130
03:27:18,764 --> 03:27:20,516
...isn't that dramatic.

1131
03:27:21,484 --> 03:27:24,044
And why, exactly, are we running away?

1132
03:27:27,084 --> 03:27:28,836
Well, go on, Dolores.

1133
03:27:29,524 --> 03:27:31,435
Perhaps it's not as bad as it seems.

1134
03:27:31,844 --> 03:27:33,835
Give it to me. It's mine!

1135
03:27:35,124 --> 03:27:36,523
Oh, my God.

1136
03:27:36,684 --> 03:27:39,198
It's your father.
He's been at you, hasn't he?

1137
03:27:39,284 --> 03:27:40,683
What are you talking about?

1138
03:27:40,764 --> 03:27:42,561
-What's he done to you?
-Nothing!

1139
03:27:42,644 --> 03:27:44,794
-He's been touchin' you, hasn't he?
-No!

1140
03:27:44,884 --> 03:27:46,397
What's he done to you?

1141
03:27:46,484 --> 03:27:49,123
You've gotta tell me the truth.
It's important.

1142
03:27:49,884 --> 03:27:51,795
Leave me alone!

1143
03:27:53,484 --> 03:27:54,758
You bitch!

1144
03:27:54,844 --> 03:27:56,675
You crazy old lying bitch!

1145
03:27:57,564 --> 03:27:59,759
You're a fucking psychotic.

1146
03:27:59,964 --> 03:28:03,240
-You think I'd make this up?
-This actually comes to you?

1147
03:28:03,324 --> 03:28:06,316
-How can you not remember?
-I remember you hitting him!

1148
03:28:06,484 --> 03:28:07,678
That I remember.

1149
03:28:07,764 --> 03:28:11,279
I remember the blood on his face,
the drinking, the fighting, but this?

1150
03:28:11,364 --> 03:28:14,959
-You're not responsible.
-Mackey's right. You are dangerous.

1151
03:28:15,124 --> 03:28:17,319
-Fuck you!
-You gotta believe me.

1152
03:28:17,484 --> 03:28:18,917
No, I don't.

1153
03:28:34,484 --> 03:28:35,473
Don't try and stop me.

1154
03:28:35,564 --> 03:28:36,917
I'm going to the hotel.

1155
03:28:37,004 --> 03:28:39,677
Mrs. Devereaux needs extra help
for the eclipse.

1156
03:28:43,804 --> 03:28:47,114
-I'll be back in a few days.
-We talked about this.

1157
03:28:47,364 --> 03:28:49,798
I don't care what we talked about.

1158
03:28:55,044 --> 03:28:58,559
I don't want to be here when you talk
to Dad about your crazy ideas.

1159
03:28:58,764 --> 03:29:00,163
Come back here right now!

1160
03:29:00,244 --> 03:29:01,757
Just leave me alone!

1161
03:30:15,324 --> 03:30:17,758
For 12 hours sleep, you don't look so good.

1162
03:30:18,404 --> 03:30:20,599
I need to be in Arizona.

1163
03:30:21,044 --> 03:30:23,399
It's a big story and I need it.

1164
03:30:24,244 --> 03:30:25,518
I know.

1165
03:30:28,084 --> 03:30:29,756
I packed your things.

1166
03:30:30,844 --> 03:30:33,199
You had stuff lyin' around.

1167
03:30:34,164 --> 03:30:36,075
Coffee's on the stove.

1168
03:31:08,884 --> 03:31:09,953
What is it?

1169
03:31:10,164 --> 03:31:13,281
It's Detective Mackey's report. Here.

1170
03:31:13,644 --> 03:31:14,963
I don't want it.

1171
03:31:18,004 --> 03:31:20,677
How remarkably brave, Mother.

1172
03:31:23,124 --> 03:31:25,035
I'll make some calls.

1173
03:31:25,444 --> 03:31:28,481
You'll have your phone
turned on tomorrow.

1174
03:31:28,764 --> 03:31:30,243
I'll take the report.

1175
03:31:30,404 --> 03:31:32,122
I'm gonna fax it to a lawyer.

1176
03:31:32,324 --> 03:31:34,918
You can expect a call tomorrow.

1177
03:31:35,364 --> 03:31:37,798
And when you talk
to that lawyer, Mother...

1178
03:31:38,044 --> 03:31:40,319
...you damn well better do what he says.

1179
03:31:40,524 --> 03:31:41,843
You'll miss your ferry.

1180
03:31:42,404 --> 03:31:43,473
You want to hang yourself?

1181
03:31:43,564 --> 03:31:46,795
Go into that inquest tomorrow
and start shooting your mouth off.

1182
03:31:56,604 --> 03:31:58,276
I'm sorry, Mother.

1183
03:32:01,524 --> 03:32:05,483
'"Sometimes being a bitch is the only thing
a woman has to hold onto.'"

1184
03:32:43,564 --> 03:32:45,202
Shit!

1185
03:32:50,964 --> 03:32:54,195
I hope I'm doing this right,
'cause I never worked one before.

1186
03:32:54,444 --> 03:32:57,277
Don't these Japanese make
the cunningest little gadgets?

1187
03:32:58,804 --> 03:33:00,157
You're sleeping now, Selena...

1188
03:33:00,244 --> 03:33:02,804
...but I know when you get up,
you're gonna leave.

1189
03:33:04,084 --> 03:33:07,394
By the time you hear this,
I figure you're in Arizona.

1190
03:33:07,804 --> 03:33:10,034
By now it's all been said and done.

1191
03:33:11,964 --> 03:33:13,920
You can forget about the lawyer.

1192
03:33:14,004 --> 03:33:16,882
I'm gonna go down tomorrow
and talk to those people and...

1193
03:33:17,564 --> 03:33:20,237
...I ain't makin' a stink about it no more.

1194
03:33:20,964 --> 03:33:24,036
I'm telling you now
what I'm gonna tell them.

1195
03:33:24,684 --> 03:33:27,198
I just thought you ought to hear it
firsthand, is all.

1196
03:33:27,284 --> 03:33:29,718
How far has he gone, Dolores?

1197
03:33:31,404 --> 03:33:33,793
She says it ain't never happened.

1198
03:33:34,804 --> 03:33:38,638
And she screamed and cried
and denied it so bad, I know it's true.

1199
03:33:39,124 --> 03:33:40,398
I should've...

1200
03:33:41,484 --> 03:33:45,033
The way she's been acting around him,
I should've known it sooner.

1201
03:33:45,364 --> 03:33:46,479
My God.

1202
03:33:46,604 --> 03:33:48,401
How far has he gone?

1203
03:33:51,244 --> 03:33:52,962
He wasn't always like this.

1204
03:33:53,564 --> 03:33:55,839
When we started out
it wasn't a dream come true...

1205
03:33:55,924 --> 03:33:57,357
Has he fucked her?

1206
03:34:01,604 --> 03:34:02,957
I don't know.

1207
03:34:04,404 --> 03:34:05,678
I don't know.

1208
03:34:08,564 --> 03:34:11,442
But if he hasn't, he's gonna soon enough.

1209
03:34:12,844 --> 03:34:15,881
He's working the boats.
He'll be back tomorrow.

1210
03:34:16,164 --> 03:34:17,563
That money...

1211
03:34:19,004 --> 03:34:23,316
I was gonna use that $3,000 to get us
as far away from here as possible.

1212
03:34:23,604 --> 03:34:25,993
And how far is that, Dolores?

1213
03:34:26,364 --> 03:34:28,673
Jonesport? Bangor?

1214
03:34:29,844 --> 03:34:33,359
You've never been more than 50 miles
away from this island in your life.

1215
03:34:35,564 --> 03:34:38,362
How long do you think
it would take him to find you?

1216
03:34:41,564 --> 03:34:45,352
It's a depressingly masculine world
we live in, Dolores.

1217
03:34:45,804 --> 03:34:46,953
Maybe I'm wrong.

1218
03:34:47,084 --> 03:34:48,836
What if you're right?

1219
03:34:50,604 --> 03:34:53,641
Husbands die every day, Dolores.

1220
03:34:53,804 --> 03:34:54,953
Why...

1221
03:34:55,124 --> 03:34:58,878
...one is probably dying right now,
while you're sittin' here weeping.

1222
03:35:00,324 --> 03:35:01,803
They die...

1223
03:35:01,964 --> 03:35:04,842
...and leave their wives their money.

1224
03:35:05,684 --> 03:35:07,720
I should know, shouldn't I?

1225
03:35:09,044 --> 03:35:12,639
Sometimes they're driving home
from their mistress's apartment...

1226
03:35:13,004 --> 03:35:15,279
...and their brakes suddenly fail.

1227
03:35:15,964 --> 03:35:17,841
An accident, Dolores...

1228
03:35:18,644 --> 03:35:21,363
...can be an unhappy woman's best friend.

1229
03:36:12,084 --> 03:36:14,314
Don't you just love the bossa nova?

1230
03:36:14,604 --> 03:36:17,357
I found them in New York.
I just had to have them.

1231
03:36:18,804 --> 03:36:20,522
Hi, how are you?

1232
03:36:20,724 --> 03:36:24,160
There's a buzzer going off in the kitchen.
You'd better check it.

1233
03:36:26,324 --> 03:36:29,521
I'm sorry, Mrs. Donovan.
We're going as fast as we can.

1234
03:36:29,684 --> 03:36:31,197
Oh, please.

1235
03:36:31,284 --> 03:36:33,479
Everything's charming.

1236
03:36:34,804 --> 03:36:36,681
They're callin' for rain.

1237
03:36:36,764 --> 03:36:38,038
Oh, don't worry.

1238
03:36:38,204 --> 03:36:40,195
I'll have my eclipse.

1239
03:36:41,684 --> 03:36:43,640
I'm sending you home, Dolores.

1240
03:36:43,964 --> 03:36:47,434
You've done a wonderful job
and it's all under control.

1241
03:36:47,644 --> 03:36:51,762
I want you to go and share this remarkable
experience with your husband.

1242
03:36:52,564 --> 03:36:54,316
He will be back, won't he?

1243
03:36:56,764 --> 03:36:58,163
I suppose so.

1244
03:37:00,444 --> 03:37:03,754
I've got you two eclipse viewers
and two reflector boxes.

1245
03:37:04,124 --> 03:37:06,638
I thought you and Joe might like them.

1246
03:37:09,484 --> 03:37:10,599
I can't.

1247
03:37:12,124 --> 03:37:13,842
Sometimes, Dolores...

1248
03:37:15,244 --> 03:37:18,919
...sometimes you have
to be a high-riding bitch...

1249
03:37:19,004 --> 03:37:20,198
...to survive.

1250
03:37:21,804 --> 03:37:23,396
Sometimes...

1251
03:37:23,564 --> 03:37:25,361
...being a bitch...

1252
03:37:25,684 --> 03:37:28,517
...is all a woman has to hang onto.

1253
03:37:40,364 --> 03:37:41,797
Thank you, Vera.

1254
03:37:43,684 --> 03:37:45,834
Now, go on home.

1255
03:37:46,484 --> 03:37:48,554
Pam and Sheila can clean up.

1256
03:37:48,764 --> 03:37:49,992
Remember...

1257
03:37:50,204 --> 03:37:52,399
...eclipse at 5:00.

1258
03:38:09,804 --> 03:38:11,920
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

1259
03:38:12,084 --> 03:38:15,076
I got some binoculars.
I'm going to find myself a good spot.

1260
03:38:21,844 --> 03:38:23,118
Come on!

1261
03:38:25,604 --> 03:38:26,593
All right!

1262
03:38:32,604 --> 03:38:34,003
Shit!

1263
03:38:36,724 --> 03:38:38,794
You sorry piece of shit.

1264
03:38:41,964 --> 03:38:43,955
What the hell are you doing back?

1265
03:38:45,364 --> 03:38:47,082
Got the afternoon off.

1266
03:38:47,404 --> 03:38:48,803
Welcome home to you too.

1267
03:38:48,964 --> 03:38:51,558
Don't start with me, Dolores.

1268
03:38:51,764 --> 03:38:53,197
Where's Selena?

1269
03:38:55,444 --> 03:38:57,275
She's working at the hotel.

1270
03:38:59,244 --> 03:39:01,314
Looks like you bought out the whole store.

1271
03:39:01,524 --> 03:39:02,877
What's all this?

1272
03:39:03,044 --> 03:39:05,353
A present to celebrate the eclipse.

1273
03:39:06,204 --> 03:39:07,796
Eclipse, shit.

1274
03:39:08,564 --> 03:39:11,920
I've felt so good lately,
I thought I'd share some of my happiness.

1275
03:39:12,004 --> 03:39:14,279
What do you got to feel happy about?

1276
03:39:25,604 --> 03:39:27,242
Well, Jesus Christ.

1277
03:39:27,764 --> 03:39:28,958
You don't want it?

1278
03:39:29,044 --> 03:39:30,841
I can always pour it down the sink.

1279
03:39:37,004 --> 03:39:40,679
Vera sent us some thingamajigs
to watch the eclipse.

1280
03:39:41,004 --> 03:39:42,756
Yeah, like I give a shit.

1281
03:39:43,164 --> 03:39:44,916
I don't want to fight with you.

1282
03:39:48,124 --> 03:39:50,274
Let's just try and enjoy the day.

1283
03:39:50,844 --> 03:39:52,482
That won't be hard.

1284
03:40:07,724 --> 03:40:09,760
That crowd. Looks like D-Day.

1285
03:40:10,724 --> 03:40:11,998
Look at them.

1286
03:40:12,764 --> 03:40:15,403
The whole goddamn island's out there.

1287
03:40:21,364 --> 03:40:22,717
I hope it rains.

1288
03:40:22,804 --> 03:40:25,238
Hope it comes down so hard
it drowns them all.

1289
03:40:32,724 --> 03:40:34,715
What the hell has gotten into you?

1290
03:40:35,124 --> 03:40:38,958
Ain't nothing gonna happen any more
than a thunderhead going across the sun.

1291
03:40:39,084 --> 03:40:41,837
Eat up, Joe, before the flies beat you to it.

1292
03:41:32,684 --> 03:41:34,561
Okay, here we go.

1293
03:41:38,004 --> 03:41:39,437
Hey, Dee!

1294
03:41:40,164 --> 03:41:44,203
Isn't this what all of you and all the rest
of them fools been waiting for?

1295
03:41:45,044 --> 03:41:47,239
Better get your butt out here.

1296
03:42:03,644 --> 03:42:04,599
Goddamn.

1297
03:42:10,964 --> 03:42:13,432
She's disappearing, all right.

1298
03:42:18,804 --> 03:42:20,840
I got another surprise for you.

1299
03:42:21,964 --> 03:42:24,558
Did somebody invent a pill
that'll cure ugly?

1300
03:42:30,564 --> 03:42:33,078
You know the money
in Selena's bank account?

1301
03:42:34,964 --> 03:42:37,239
Yeah, well, what about it?

1302
03:42:37,724 --> 03:42:39,282
You took it.

1303
03:42:47,164 --> 03:42:48,995
Don't you look sour.

1304
03:42:53,564 --> 03:42:56,124
-I guess it is pretty funny, ain't it?
-Yeah.

1305
03:42:57,324 --> 03:43:00,077
I fooled you right and proper, didn't I?

1306
03:43:00,564 --> 03:43:02,794
You fooled me about a lot of things, Joe...

1307
03:43:03,164 --> 03:43:05,280
...but I guess I finally caught up with you.

1308
03:43:05,364 --> 03:43:07,594
You already spent $500 of it.

1309
03:43:08,684 --> 03:43:10,436
What'd it go for, Joe?

1310
03:43:11,124 --> 03:43:12,079
Poker?

1311
03:43:12,564 --> 03:43:13,838
Beer?

1312
03:43:15,124 --> 03:43:17,160
There you go, selling me short.

1313
03:43:17,364 --> 03:43:19,036
It was set aside for school.

1314
03:43:19,284 --> 03:43:22,959
You blew all our money, you may as well
run through hers, while you're at it.

1315
03:43:23,164 --> 03:43:25,632
School, shit.

1316
03:43:29,564 --> 03:43:32,556
You can't even wipe your ass
for $3,000 these days.

1317
03:43:34,684 --> 03:43:37,323
I spent the day with the people
at the bank.

1318
03:43:37,644 --> 03:43:39,680
It turns out you weren't supposed
to do that.

1319
03:43:39,764 --> 03:43:41,083
Lie to them.

1320
03:43:41,204 --> 03:43:43,115
Make them break their rules.

1321
03:43:44,244 --> 03:43:45,836
What did you go and do?

1322
03:43:46,004 --> 03:43:48,916
I got all that money
given right back to me in cash.

1323
03:43:49,284 --> 03:43:51,923
All but the $500 you pissed away.

1324
03:43:52,124 --> 03:43:54,160
So you can just go and fuck yourself.

1325
03:43:54,324 --> 03:43:57,361
That is if you can get that limp old noodle
of yours to stand up.

1326
03:43:59,284 --> 03:44:02,481
I told you what I'd do
if you didn't stop being fresh with me!

1327
03:44:02,564 --> 03:44:03,883
Didn't I?

1328
03:44:04,684 --> 03:44:06,561
You believe me now, do you?

1329
03:44:06,684 --> 03:44:08,800
Yes. Yes, Joe!

1330
03:44:19,804 --> 03:44:21,203
Oh, my God.

1331
03:44:25,044 --> 03:44:26,318
Look at that.

1332
03:44:27,644 --> 03:44:28,872
A star.

1333
03:44:32,444 --> 03:44:33,672
A star.

1334
03:44:33,884 --> 03:44:37,513
You'll see plenty of them if you don't start
tellin' me where that money is.

1335
03:44:37,844 --> 03:44:39,118
Right now!

1336
03:44:39,764 --> 03:44:41,197
I buried it...

1337
03:44:42,044 --> 03:44:43,272
...in the yard.

1338
03:44:44,684 --> 03:44:45,878
Out by the field.

1339
03:44:46,164 --> 03:44:49,474
Let's just go get it back where it belongs,
why don't we?

1340
03:44:51,404 --> 03:44:54,760
Believe you me,
there better be every last cent of it.

1341
03:44:55,724 --> 03:44:59,399
You'd better save the big talk
for your pals at the barber shop!

1342
03:44:59,564 --> 03:45:01,873
I wonder if they'll think
you're such a stud...

1343
03:45:01,964 --> 03:45:04,478
...when they find out the only ass
you can get...

1344
03:45:04,564 --> 03:45:07,032
...belongs to your 13-year-old daughter!

1345
03:45:08,844 --> 03:45:11,802
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Really?

1346
03:45:12,084 --> 03:45:16,874
Then how come you look like the devil just
grabbed them little raisins you call balls?

1347
03:45:20,404 --> 03:45:22,679
She's a liar. She's a little liar.

1348
03:45:23,244 --> 03:45:24,723
And a goddamn tease.

1349
03:45:27,924 --> 03:45:29,562
How could you do it, Joe?

1350
03:45:31,964 --> 03:45:34,159
After everything I did for her...

1351
03:45:35,084 --> 03:45:37,996
...she's mouthing off like that,
telling lies like...

1352
03:45:38,964 --> 03:45:41,478
When she gets back I'm gonna get my belt.

1353
03:45:43,124 --> 03:45:44,443
I'm gonna get my belt.

1354
03:45:44,724 --> 03:45:48,637
The only thing you're gonna get is
a long stretch in Shawshank Prison...

1355
03:45:48,884 --> 03:45:50,442
...for child molesting!

1356
03:45:50,564 --> 03:45:51,917
Goddamn bitch!

1357
03:45:56,724 --> 03:45:59,602
The more you run, the worse it's gonna be.

1358
03:45:59,804 --> 03:46:01,237
Get off me!

1359
03:46:09,324 --> 03:46:11,963
You're gonna get your payback now, bitch.

1360
03:46:12,124 --> 03:46:14,558
And it's gonna cost you more than money!

1361
03:46:14,724 --> 03:46:16,043
You're mine now!

1362
03:46:29,004 --> 03:46:32,076
Give me your hand
before I fall all the way in, please!

1363
03:46:32,884 --> 03:46:35,318
Help me before I fall all the way in,
goddamn it!

1364
03:46:36,524 --> 03:46:38,515
You don't know what you're doing.

1365
03:46:39,644 --> 03:46:40,599
Where are you going?

1366
03:46:40,684 --> 03:46:43,721
Oh, God, what're you doing?
Dee, come on!

1367
03:46:44,684 --> 03:46:47,357
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

1368
03:46:52,204 --> 03:46:53,478
Please!

1369
03:46:55,284 --> 03:46:56,512
You bitch!

1370
03:46:56,924 --> 03:46:58,721
I swear, you're gonna die.

1371
03:47:02,044 --> 03:47:03,443
Help, somebody!

1372
03:47:03,764 --> 03:47:05,436
Somebody help me, please.

1373
03:47:05,844 --> 03:47:07,277
Help!

1374
03:47:08,724 --> 03:47:10,123
Help, somebody!

1375
03:47:10,644 --> 03:47:12,760
-Oh, goddamn it!
-Nobody can hear you.

1376
03:47:12,964 --> 03:47:16,877
You bitch! Oh, you just better hope
I don't get out.

1377
03:47:48,684 --> 03:47:51,562
The eclipse lasted six and a half minutes.

1378
03:47:51,964 --> 03:47:54,478
They said it was some kind of record.

1379
03:47:55,404 --> 03:47:58,680
It was a lot more than a thunderhead
passing across the sun.

1380
03:48:00,044 --> 03:48:01,796
It was beautiful.

1381
03:48:08,284 --> 03:48:09,876
I burned the dress...

1382
03:48:10,364 --> 03:48:12,958
...and I dropped the whiskey bottle
out near the well.

1383
03:48:13,364 --> 03:48:17,562
I started askin' folks if they'd seen Joe
off on a bender somewhere.

1384
03:48:17,884 --> 03:48:20,239
Besides Mackey showing up
and making trouble...

1385
03:48:20,324 --> 03:48:22,713
...it was easier than I thought.

1386
03:48:29,324 --> 03:48:30,837
That's what happened...

1387
03:48:30,924 --> 03:48:32,243
...plain and true.

1388
03:48:32,324 --> 03:48:34,838
And I don't care no more who knows it.

1389
03:48:35,644 --> 03:48:37,794
I guess all I do care about...

1390
03:48:38,644 --> 03:48:40,680
...all I ever cared about...

1391
03:48:40,924 --> 03:48:43,119
...is that you're safe and sound.

1392
03:48:44,844 --> 03:48:46,163
I lied to you.

1393
03:48:48,284 --> 03:48:50,115
And I lied to myself.

1394
03:48:51,124 --> 03:48:53,194
Now it's time to pay the piper.

1395
03:49:43,284 --> 03:49:44,558
Here we go.

1396
03:49:45,604 --> 03:49:47,401
One coffee, $1.

1397
03:49:48,884 --> 03:49:50,761
Out of $5.

1398
03:49:55,924 --> 03:50:00,236
Okay, one coffee, one hot cocoa,
that'll be 60 cents.

1399
03:50:01,244 --> 03:50:03,394
McCrea, it ain't worth half that.

1400
03:50:05,404 --> 03:50:06,757
There you go.

1401
03:50:44,404 --> 03:50:47,362
You look cold enough
to climb inside a clam shell.

1402
03:50:48,884 --> 03:50:50,602
Here, this'll warm you up.

1403
03:50:57,404 --> 03:50:59,042
What's wrong, you don't want it?

1404
03:50:59,124 --> 03:51:00,682
It's hot chocolate for you.

1405
03:51:00,764 --> 03:51:03,437
Come on, let's take the top off.

1406
03:51:04,404 --> 03:51:06,440
You got that little thing I give you?

1407
03:51:06,724 --> 03:51:08,316
Let's have a look at it.

1408
03:51:09,204 --> 03:51:11,434
You know, this is very special, Selena.

1409
03:51:12,564 --> 03:51:14,759
My mother got it from her mother.

1410
03:51:14,924 --> 03:51:17,233
You know, I'm not gonna give it
just to anybody.

1411
03:51:17,324 --> 03:51:19,758
It's very special for you, okay, sweetheart?

1412
03:51:20,844 --> 03:51:21,674
Here.

1413
03:51:21,844 --> 03:51:22,959
Take that.

1414
03:51:23,124 --> 03:51:25,194
It's a very special thing for you.

1415
03:51:26,524 --> 03:51:27,593
Your hands cold?

1416
03:51:27,684 --> 03:51:29,322
I'm okay.

1417
03:51:30,444 --> 03:51:33,197
-Here, give me your hands.
-I'm fine.

1418
03:51:35,284 --> 03:51:37,081
Nobody's gonna see us, sweetheart.

1419
03:51:37,404 --> 03:51:39,122
Here. Come on. Give me your hands.

1420
03:51:39,204 --> 03:51:40,876
My cocoa will spill.

1421
03:51:41,084 --> 03:51:42,517
Oh, gosh.

1422
03:51:43,964 --> 03:51:45,682
I'll buy you another one.

1423
03:51:46,004 --> 03:51:48,438
-Come on, let me dry your hands.
-All right.

1424
03:51:49,004 --> 03:51:51,234
Oh, gosh. Your hand's cold.

1425
03:51:52,604 --> 03:51:53,832
I can't.

1426
03:51:54,004 --> 03:51:55,119
I can't.

1427
03:52:02,684 --> 03:52:04,322
No, Daddy, please.

1428
03:52:12,804 --> 03:52:15,364
Come on, now. You know how to do it.
I showed you.

1429
03:52:15,444 --> 03:52:18,481
Remember how I showed you?
Nobody's gonna see us.

1430
03:52:20,404 --> 03:52:21,519
Come on, baby.

1431
03:52:21,604 --> 03:52:22,832
You remember?

1432
03:52:28,124 --> 03:52:30,240
You remember how I showed you?

1433
03:52:32,844 --> 03:52:33,879
Please.

1434
03:52:34,484 --> 03:52:35,599
Come on.

1435
03:52:37,004 --> 03:52:38,437
Come on, that's it.

1436
03:52:38,564 --> 03:52:40,202
Oh, that's it.

1437
03:52:40,364 --> 03:52:42,161
You're my good girl.

1438
03:52:42,644 --> 03:52:44,362
I love you, Selena.

1439
03:52:45,124 --> 03:52:46,637
You're my good girl.

1440
03:52:50,164 --> 03:52:52,075
You want your change or what?

1441
03:52:57,244 --> 03:52:59,314
No. You keep it.

1442
03:53:31,924 --> 03:53:34,154
I was gonna kill her, Your Honor.

1443
03:53:34,884 --> 03:53:36,363
She tried to do it herself...

1444
03:53:36,444 --> 03:53:38,321
...but she was still alive.

1445
03:53:38,604 --> 03:53:41,198
She begged me to finish what she started.

1446
03:53:42,844 --> 03:53:44,994
I didn't know if I could do it or not.

1447
03:53:45,524 --> 03:53:48,561
By the time I got back from the kitchen
she was dead.

1448
03:53:48,884 --> 03:53:51,034
Just your good luck, I guess.

1449
03:53:53,324 --> 03:53:55,997
They tell me you've waived your right
to council.

1450
03:53:56,284 --> 03:53:57,353
Yes, sir.

1451
03:53:57,884 --> 03:54:01,081
I tell you, I've married people
who've brought lawyers with them.

1452
03:54:02,124 --> 03:54:03,921
Let's just get this over with.

1453
03:54:05,884 --> 03:54:08,079
Before I sign Detective Mackey's report...

1454
03:54:08,204 --> 03:54:11,276
...there are a few things
I'd like him to clarify for me.

1455
03:54:11,644 --> 03:54:12,997
Ms. Claiborne...

1456
03:54:13,204 --> 03:54:14,717
...I have several witnesses...

1457
03:54:14,804 --> 03:54:19,400
...who say they were present when
you threatened the life of Vera Donovan.

1458
03:54:20,884 --> 03:54:22,317
Now that's true, is it not?

1459
03:54:22,444 --> 03:54:25,754
Why don't you just go ahead and ask me
what you really want to know?

1460
03:54:25,844 --> 03:54:28,438
In due time, Ms. Claiborne. In due time.

1461
03:54:29,324 --> 03:54:32,236
-Is it true you made those threats?
-Of course, it's true.

1462
03:54:32,524 --> 03:54:34,355
She told you herself on Saturday.

1463
03:54:34,524 --> 03:54:36,640
I'm sorry. This is a closed hearing.

1464
03:54:38,204 --> 03:54:42,083
The woman sitting over there, the one
without a lawyer, that's my mother.

1465
03:54:42,164 --> 03:54:45,395
This isn't a trial.
I have every right to be here with her.

1466
03:54:46,844 --> 03:54:48,243
Selena St. George.

1467
03:54:48,364 --> 03:54:51,515
Don't stop. Let's just wrap this up
and get back to the mainland.

1468
03:54:51,644 --> 03:54:54,556
This report is incomplete.
Maybe before you sign off on this...

1469
03:54:54,644 --> 03:54:57,636
We're in the middle of a questioning here,
Miss St. George.

1470
03:54:58,044 --> 03:55:00,080
My mother did not kill Vera Donovan.

1471
03:55:00,364 --> 03:55:03,322
That's funny. I've got 30 pages here
that say she did.

1472
03:55:03,404 --> 03:55:05,315
This thing is totally circumstantial.

1473
03:55:05,684 --> 03:55:08,881
I've covered enough courtrooms
to know he's got no hard evidence.

1474
03:55:08,964 --> 03:55:12,081
Circumstantial? Samuel Marchant, page 6!

1475
03:55:12,764 --> 03:55:14,755
Tell him what's not in the report.

1476
03:55:14,844 --> 03:55:17,995
You've had the whole weekend
to get yourself a lawyer.

1477
03:55:18,204 --> 03:55:20,672
What is it that's not in the report?

1478
03:55:22,924 --> 03:55:25,074
These two women loved each other.

1479
03:55:28,204 --> 03:55:29,637
Oh, really?

1480
03:55:31,124 --> 03:55:33,797
Now that's something we'd like to hear.

1481
03:55:34,804 --> 03:55:36,203
That's something...

1482
03:55:36,284 --> 03:55:39,037
...we definitely missed
in our investigation...

1483
03:55:39,444 --> 03:55:40,763
...isn't it, Frank?

1484
03:55:43,044 --> 03:55:46,434
Why don't you tell us
about this great mutual affection?

1485
03:55:48,124 --> 03:55:49,876
Your personal observations.

1486
03:55:51,124 --> 03:55:53,433
How'd they get along when you'd visit?

1487
03:55:54,044 --> 03:55:56,399
Christmas, birthdays, holidays...

1488
03:55:57,044 --> 03:56:00,719
...whenever you could tear yourself away
from your judicial reportage.

1489
03:56:02,364 --> 03:56:04,594
Why don't you tell us, Miss St. George?

1490
03:56:06,044 --> 03:56:08,558
When was your last visit?

1491
03:56:12,284 --> 03:56:13,319
Miss?

1492
03:56:16,524 --> 03:56:18,082
Fifteen years ago.

1493
03:56:21,644 --> 03:56:23,874
You must have some memory.

1494
03:56:25,364 --> 03:56:27,958
These women were together for 22 years.

1495
03:56:28,324 --> 03:56:30,633
My mother spent the last 10 caring
for Vera...

1496
03:56:30,724 --> 03:56:33,443
...24 hours a day, 365 days a year...

1497
03:56:33,924 --> 03:56:35,323
...for $80 a week.

1498
03:56:35,484 --> 03:56:37,281
You should quit while you're ahead.

1499
03:56:37,364 --> 03:56:39,559
He says they hated each other.

1500
03:56:39,804 --> 03:56:43,274
I want to know if you hated each other
so much why you stayed together?

1501
03:56:44,044 --> 03:56:45,602
There were other jobs...

1502
03:56:45,844 --> 03:56:46,959
...better jobs.

1503
03:56:48,084 --> 03:56:49,995
Why go through 20 years of hell?

1504
03:56:51,084 --> 03:56:53,439
-Why, Mother?
-Please, Miss. This is embarrassing.

1505
03:56:53,524 --> 03:56:55,992
You're supposed to be a professional,
aren't you?

1506
03:56:56,284 --> 03:56:57,922
We know I never visited.

1507
03:56:58,684 --> 03:57:00,003
Who did?

1508
03:57:00,084 --> 03:57:03,121
In the past few years,
who else has been in that house?

1509
03:57:04,524 --> 03:57:06,116
Doc Collin came once a month.

1510
03:57:06,204 --> 03:57:08,160
Let's not forget Sammy Marchant.

1511
03:57:09,484 --> 03:57:12,442
Nobody else gave a damn
whether they lived or died.

1512
03:57:12,924 --> 03:57:14,801
All they had was each other.

1513
03:57:15,404 --> 03:57:17,315
That's why you stayed together.

1514
03:57:18,124 --> 03:57:20,638
I mean, is that what you do
when you hate someone?

1515
03:57:20,724 --> 03:57:22,919
You trade off your life for...

1516
03:57:23,804 --> 03:57:26,398
...what, 20 cents an hour
just to keep them going?

1517
03:57:26,644 --> 03:57:28,794
Please, all this is very touching.

1518
03:57:29,844 --> 03:57:33,041
But $1,600,000...

1519
03:57:34,044 --> 03:57:36,114
...is a little more than 20 cents an hour.

1520
03:57:36,204 --> 03:57:38,320
My mother never knew about the will.

1521
03:57:39,004 --> 03:57:41,723
Come on, Miss St. George.

1522
03:57:41,884 --> 03:57:44,842
The will is eight years old.

1523
03:57:45,204 --> 03:57:46,478
You were there, Frank.

1524
03:57:46,604 --> 03:57:48,959
When Mackey told her about the will.

1525
03:57:49,044 --> 03:57:50,079
You think she knew?

1526
03:57:50,164 --> 03:57:51,483
He is not on trial.

1527
03:57:51,564 --> 03:57:53,361
Neither is my mother.

1528
03:57:53,764 --> 03:57:55,277
Constable?

1529
03:58:02,164 --> 03:58:04,837
She seemed pretty surprised, I guess...

1530
03:58:05,524 --> 03:58:06,798
...to me.

1531
03:58:10,564 --> 03:58:11,713
That's how I saw it.

1532
03:58:15,844 --> 03:58:18,278
You want us to believe
that they were best friends...

1533
03:58:18,364 --> 03:58:22,073
...and alone for eight years
and they never even talked about it?

1534
03:58:22,644 --> 03:58:25,841
I think people can keep secrets
a lot longer than eight years.

1535
03:58:26,004 --> 03:58:29,155
A $1,600,000 secret?

1536
03:58:29,244 --> 03:58:30,472
Come on!

1537
03:58:32,084 --> 03:58:34,552
Did you know about the will,
Ms. Claiborne?

1538
03:58:36,244 --> 03:58:37,643
No, sir.

1539
03:58:38,764 --> 03:58:42,916
Vera made it pretty clear she was plannin'
on takin' it all with her when she went.

1540
03:58:43,164 --> 03:58:46,600
I figured when she died there'd be
some laundry and a fare-thee-well.

1541
03:58:46,684 --> 03:58:48,276
Isn't that convenient?

1542
03:58:48,364 --> 03:58:49,956
You don't believe her?

1543
03:58:50,524 --> 03:58:52,560
Then I tell you what, Detective.

1544
03:58:52,644 --> 03:58:56,034
We may be in the presence
of a truly gifted criminal mind.

1545
03:58:56,124 --> 03:58:58,638
For eight years she's a heartbeat away...

1546
03:58:58,724 --> 03:59:01,033
...from being the richest woman
on the island.

1547
03:59:01,404 --> 03:59:02,632
So what does she do?

1548
03:59:03,004 --> 03:59:05,564
Does she wait one year
and let Vera drown in the tub?

1549
03:59:06,004 --> 03:59:07,562
Three years starving her?

1550
03:59:07,644 --> 03:59:09,157
You're digging in deeper.

1551
03:59:09,244 --> 03:59:10,916
Smother her in her sleep?

1552
03:59:11,284 --> 03:59:12,512
Drug her?

1553
03:59:14,004 --> 03:59:17,474
My mother's plan is far more brilliant
than that.

1554
03:59:18,044 --> 03:59:23,118
She waits through eight years of bed pans,
sponge baths, diapers and bed sores.

1555
03:59:23,564 --> 03:59:26,920
She waits eight years until Vera's
already got one foot in the grave.

1556
03:59:27,004 --> 03:59:28,198
Then what does she do?

1557
03:59:28,284 --> 03:59:30,400
-We know.
-That's your theory, isn't it?

1558
03:59:30,484 --> 03:59:32,839
She waited eight years
to throw her down the stairs.

1559
03:59:32,924 --> 03:59:34,880
Yes. To make it look like an accident.

1560
03:59:34,964 --> 03:59:38,513
An accident? She ransacked the kitchen
for a rolling pin.

1561
03:59:38,604 --> 03:59:39,559
Calm down!

1562
03:59:39,644 --> 03:59:42,397
How will beating Vera to death
look like an accident?

1563
03:59:42,484 --> 03:59:44,918
She panicked, just as you're doing now.

1564
03:59:51,244 --> 03:59:53,758
Sammy Marchant brought the mail
every day at noon.

1565
03:59:53,844 --> 03:59:55,516
-Why not wait?
-She panicked.

1566
03:59:55,604 --> 03:59:58,198
-She knew she had to finish...
-How do you know?

1567
03:59:58,284 --> 03:59:59,797
Fourteen years' experience.

1568
03:59:59,884 --> 04:00:01,954
-You've never been wrong.
-Not when it counted.

1569
04:00:02,044 --> 04:00:05,719
-That's right, you're 85 for 86, aren't you?
-Yes, I am.

1570
04:00:05,884 --> 04:00:09,081
-One case away from a perfect record.
-This report is the truth.

1571
04:00:09,164 --> 04:00:12,634
Truth? Bullshit! Why don't you tell him
why we're really here?

1572
04:00:19,764 --> 04:00:21,561
Go on.

1573
04:00:23,844 --> 04:00:25,163
Tell him.

1574
04:00:32,404 --> 04:00:34,122
Because she's done it before.

1575
04:00:34,484 --> 04:00:37,715
Wait a minute.
Is there some prior felony here, John?

1576
04:00:43,044 --> 04:00:44,477
No, there's not.

1577
04:00:44,564 --> 04:00:46,600
They wouldn't indict her.

1578
04:00:54,684 --> 04:00:56,276
Eighteen years ago...

1579
04:00:57,884 --> 04:00:59,522
...my father drank some scotch...

1580
04:00:59,604 --> 04:01:01,083
...and fell down a well.

1581
04:01:02,044 --> 04:01:04,956
Detective Mackey didn't think
it was an accident, which is...

1582
04:01:05,484 --> 04:01:07,236
...why we're here today.

1583
04:01:09,244 --> 04:01:11,200
What do you think, Selena?

1584
04:01:14,644 --> 04:01:16,714
I think that I owe you an apology.

1585
04:01:19,804 --> 04:01:21,795
I called you a son of a bitch.

1586
04:01:23,444 --> 04:01:25,753
You said you thought we were a lot alike.

1587
04:01:25,964 --> 04:01:27,317
And you were right.

1588
04:01:28,684 --> 04:01:31,642
We've both spent the past 18 years
prosecuting this woman.

1589
04:01:32,884 --> 04:01:34,397
We came out here...

1590
04:01:34,964 --> 04:01:36,682
...I know I did...

1591
04:01:36,964 --> 04:01:39,000
...believing she was guilty.

1592
04:01:39,604 --> 04:01:42,596
We forgot this case is
about Vera Donovan...

1593
04:01:43,124 --> 04:01:44,398
...not my father.

1594
04:01:44,604 --> 04:01:47,277
And what if it wasn't an accident?

1595
04:01:48,084 --> 04:01:49,312
Look...

1596
04:01:52,124 --> 04:01:54,843
...it's been 18 years.

1597
04:01:56,204 --> 04:01:58,764
I don't know what this has done to you...

1598
04:01:59,884 --> 04:02:02,239
...but let me tell you, it's consumed me.

1599
04:02:04,044 --> 04:02:07,002
I have lived with this every day of my life.

1600
04:02:08,844 --> 04:02:10,323
Every day.

1601
04:02:14,644 --> 04:02:15,918
But it was wrong...

1602
04:02:16,324 --> 04:02:18,519
...and I won't do it anymore.

1603
04:02:21,004 --> 04:02:23,438
And if I can say that, my God...

1604
04:02:24,204 --> 04:02:25,637
...can't you?

1605
04:02:31,884 --> 04:02:33,602
She didn't kill Vera Donovan.

1606
04:02:34,164 --> 04:02:36,724
You've been out here looking
for a smoking gun.

1607
04:02:36,964 --> 04:02:38,317
There isn't one.

1608
04:02:38,524 --> 04:02:42,199
All you've got is a 30-page description
of a suicide.

1609
04:02:42,404 --> 04:02:43,917
I'm asking you...

1610
04:02:44,284 --> 04:02:45,683
...as an honorable man...

1611
04:02:48,364 --> 04:02:50,161
...with all of your experience...

1612
04:02:51,044 --> 04:02:52,397
...all that you've seen...

1613
04:02:53,844 --> 04:02:55,357
...would we be here now...

1614
04:02:55,444 --> 04:02:58,675
...if this was anyone other
than Dolores Claiborne?

1615
04:03:00,564 --> 04:03:02,759
This report's the truth!

1616
04:03:26,884 --> 04:03:31,435
I'd like you to know that if you go
to trial with this, you'll fail again.

1617
04:03:32,404 --> 04:03:35,396
You'd better ask yourself
how you want to finish your career.

1618
04:03:35,924 --> 04:03:38,119
I've got a long list of New York lawyers...

1619
04:03:38,204 --> 04:03:42,595
...who'd just love to take you
and this case apart in front of a jury.

1620
04:03:47,804 --> 04:03:48,873
Mother...

1621
04:03:49,004 --> 04:03:50,676
Come on, let's go.

1622
04:03:51,004 --> 04:03:52,722
They can't hurt you anymore.

1623
04:03:56,004 --> 04:03:57,232
John?

1624
04:03:57,444 --> 04:03:58,923
This is your ball game.

1625
04:03:59,764 --> 04:04:02,039
I'm gonna leave this up to you.

1626
04:04:08,884 --> 04:04:10,283
Come on.

1627
04:04:11,084 --> 04:04:12,358
It's time.

1628
04:05:11,404 --> 04:05:13,520
Even when it's warm here, it's cold.

1629
04:05:16,404 --> 04:05:18,759
It won't be like that in Arizona.

1630
04:05:25,684 --> 04:05:27,117
There is no Arizona.

1631
04:05:30,284 --> 04:05:31,956
I don't have to go.

1632
04:05:32,604 --> 04:05:34,196
It was a lie.

1633
04:05:36,844 --> 04:05:38,436
My editor...

1634
04:05:39,284 --> 04:05:41,320
...the story, the book...

1635
04:05:41,484 --> 04:05:42,803
...it's all over.

1636
04:05:48,404 --> 04:05:50,918
Do I still have to worry about you?

1637
04:05:56,884 --> 04:05:59,239
I don't know how to feel
about what you did.

1638
04:06:00,684 --> 04:06:02,003
Maybe I never will.

1639
04:06:08,364 --> 04:06:10,241
But I know you did it for me.

1640
04:06:25,324 --> 04:06:27,679
I don't want to lose you again.

1641
04:06:30,164 --> 04:06:31,597
Go on.

1642
04:06:31,804 --> 04:06:33,715
You're not gonna lose me.

1643
04:06:36,164 --> 04:06:37,722
You go on.

1644
04:07:40,804 --> 04:07:42,795
