1
00:01:51,205 --> 00:01:53,219
Katie!

2
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:55,329
Cora!

3
00:01:55,521 --> 00:01:56,959
You love your sister?

4
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:59,645
You make any noise,
you know what happens.

5
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,679
Good morning, Estelle.

6
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:49,419
-How am i looking, Paul?
-That's better. That's better.

7
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:06,394
Morning, Mr. Edgecomb.

8
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:07,929
Some Danish?

9
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,189
No, just two pieces of
dry toast, Hector. Thanks.

10
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:12,724
Leftover's fine.

11
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:15,025
Dry and cold, same as always.

12
00:03:15,217 --> 00:03:16,176
Cold is better.

13
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:19,533
Especially on those long walks.

14
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,122
Am i right?

15
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:26,918
Don't let Nurse Godzilla catch you.
She'll raise holy hell.

16
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:29,123
We're not supposed to
let you wander off.

17
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:36,029
Where do you go every day?
What do you do up in those hills?

18
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,043
Just walk.

19
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,057
I like to walk.

20
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,372
Try not to fall down, bust a hip.

21
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:47,345
I don't wanna be in no
damn search party.

22
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:58,506
You want this man in your life?
Explain the moral basis of that.

23
00:04:58,698 --> 00:04:59,657
I've made mistakes.

24
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:02,726
Tony doesn't admit that
he's not a good father.

25
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:05,795
You can't ask nothing.
I have six kids myself.

26
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:09,439
Why do we always watch this stuff?

27
00:05:10,207 --> 00:05:11,549
lt's interesting.

28
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:16,728
lnteresting?
Bunch of inbred trailer trash?

29
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,414
All they ever talk about is fucking.

30
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:42,335
Are you all right?

31
00:05:43,486 --> 00:05:45,883
You look tired. You're not yourself.

32
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:48,664
No, I'm fine. I promise.

33
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,596
You're wearing yourself out
with those walks every day, I think.

34
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:54,610
Not that you asked me.

35
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:57,679
I just didn't sleep well, is all.

36
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:01,803
I had a few bad dreams. lt happens.

37
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,625
I'll be fine.

38
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:14,271
If Madge doesn't care,
I certainly don't.

39
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:15,518
Neither do I.

40
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:18,299
Now, this here is worth a look.

41
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:21,847
I'm in heaven

42
00:06:22,998 --> 00:06:27,793
And my heart beats so
That I can hardly speak

43
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:31,054
And I seem to find

44
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:34,794
The happiness I seek

45
00:06:35,274 --> 00:06:38,055
When we're out together

46
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:41,124
Dancing cheek to cheek

47
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:43,905
Heaven

48
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:46,782
I'm in heaven

49
00:06:47,646 --> 00:06:50,235
And the cares that hung around me

50
00:06:50,427 --> 00:06:53,112
Through the week

51
00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:54,934
Seem to vanish

52
00:06:55,222 --> 00:06:58,099
Like a gambler's lucky streak

53
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,278
Paul, what is it?

54
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,922
My God.

55
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:14,211
I've got to get out of here.

56
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,571
I guess sometimes the past
just catches up with you...

57
00:07:38,763 --> 00:07:41,736
...whether you want it to or not.
lt's silly.

58
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:45,380
Was it the film? lt was, wasn't it?

59
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:50,751
I haven't spoken of these things
for a long time, Ellie.

60
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:52,285
Over 60 years.

61
00:07:52,477 --> 00:07:55,162
Paul, I'm your friend.

62
00:07:59,574 --> 00:08:03,218
I ever tell you that i was
a prison guard during the Depression?

63
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,136
You've mentioned it.

64
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,397
Did i mention i was
in charge of death row?

65
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,699
That i supervised all the executions?

66
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,426
Usually, death row is called
"The Last Mile."

67
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,112
We called ours "The Green Mile."

68
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,756
The floor was the color
of faded limes.

69
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:29,113
We had the electric chair.

70
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,222
"Old Sparky," we called it.

71
00:08:33,524 --> 00:08:36,305
I've lived a lot of years, Ellie...

72
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:40,717
...but 1 935, that takes the prize.

73
00:08:41,964 --> 00:08:43,690
That year, i had...

74
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:47,047
...the worst urinary infection
of my life.

75
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:50,020
lt was....

76
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:53,185
lt was also the year of...

77
00:08:53,664 --> 00:08:55,774
...John Coffey...

78
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:59,227
...and the two dead girls.

79
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:12,689
Put me through to E Block.

80
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:27,459
E Block.

81
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:30,815
Right.

82
00:10:50,955 --> 00:10:53,257
Paul? Prisoner.

83
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:54,983
Christ, give me a minute.

84
00:11:00,354 --> 00:11:01,505
You all right?

85
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:07,834
For a man pissing razorblades, yeah.

86
00:11:21,741 --> 00:11:24,042
You should've took the day off
to see the doctor.

87
00:11:24,234 --> 00:11:26,823
With the new arrival?
You know better.

88
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,837
Besides...

89
00:11:29,317 --> 00:11:32,674
...it's not as bad as it was.
I think it's clearing up.

90
00:11:35,743 --> 00:11:37,469
-Let's look alive, Dean.
-Yes, sir.

91
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:45,717
Damn.

92
00:11:46,963 --> 00:11:48,881
They're riding on the axle.

93
00:11:58,088 --> 00:11:59,431
What'd they do?

94
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:01,349
They bust the springs?

95
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:11,227
Dead man!

96
00:12:11,994 --> 00:12:13,625
Dead man walking!

97
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,173
We got a dead man walking here!

98
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:20,338
Jesus please us,
what is he yelling about?

99
00:12:25,325 --> 00:12:28,202
You might reconsider getting
in the cell with this guy.

100
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:29,737
He's enormous.

101
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:31,847
Can't be bigger than you.

102
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:43,163
Dead man!

103
00:12:44,122 --> 00:12:45,369
Dead man walking!

104
00:12:45,561 --> 00:12:47,000
Dead man!

105
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:48,630
Dead man walking!

106
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,699
Dead man walking here!

107
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:54,192
Dead man!

108
00:12:57,645 --> 00:12:59,371
We got a dead man walking here!

109
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,152
Dead man walking!

110
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,756
-We got a dead man walking here!
-Percy.

111
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:09,345
That's enough.

112
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:33,993
Am i gonna have any trouble
with you, big boy?

113
00:13:38,788 --> 00:13:39,843
Can you talk?

114
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:49,050
Yes, sir, boss. I can talk.

115
00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:58,065
Move your ass.

116
00:13:58,736 --> 00:13:59,695
Let's go.

117
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:01,517
Come on.

118
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,559
Percy...

119
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,491
...they're moving house
in the infirmary.

120
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,848
Why don't you go see
if they could use some help?

121
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:17,150
They got all the men they need.

122
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:19,356
Why don't you just make sure?

123
00:14:22,137 --> 00:14:25,685
I don't care where you go, as long as
it's not here at this moment.

124
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:31,056
All right.

125
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:45,633
God, you bust my finger.

126
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:48,127
I wiped that grin
off your face, didn't l?

127
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,525
Goddamn it, Percy,
get the hell off my block!

128
00:15:02,992 --> 00:15:04,047
Fuck you, Percy.

129
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:07,404
We'll get that looked at, Del.
ln the meantime, stay quiet.

130
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:16,323
I let Harry take those chains off you...

131
00:15:16,898 --> 00:15:18,049
...you gonna be nice?

132
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:35,983
Your name is John Coffey.

133
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:37,901
Yes, sir, boss.

134
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:41,450
Like the drink,
only not spelt the same.

135
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,176
You can spell, can you?

136
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:46,629
Just my name, boss.

137
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:49,602
J...O--

138
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:51,903
My name is Paul Edgecomb.

139
00:15:52,766 --> 00:15:55,452
lf i'm not here, you can
ask for Mr. Terwilliger...

140
00:15:55,644 --> 00:15:58,617
...Mr. Howell or Mr. Stanton.
These gentlemen right there.

141
00:16:01,014 --> 00:16:02,165
Questions?

142
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,138
Do you leave the light on
after bedtime?

143
00:16:07,728 --> 00:16:11,084
Because i get a little scared
in the dark sometime...

144
00:16:11,756 --> 00:16:14,249
...if it's a strange place.

145
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,785
lt stays pretty bright around here
all night long.

146
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:25,470
We keep a few lights burning
in the corridor.

147
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:28,443
The corridor?

148
00:16:29,977 --> 00:16:31,320
Right out there.

149
00:16:58,269 --> 00:16:59,804
You can sit.

150
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,492
I couldn't help it, boss.

151
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,945
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

152
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:36,823
Take Delacroix to the infirmary,
see if those fingers are broken.

153
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,412
Of course they are.
I heard the bones crack.

154
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,385
You hear what he was yelling
when we brought the dummy in?

155
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:44,399
How could i miss it?
The whole prison heard.

156
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:46,413
Goddamn Percy.

157
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,962
You'll have to answer
for sending him off the Mile.

158
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:53,031
I'll chew that food when i have to.

159
00:17:53,318 --> 00:17:57,442
Right now i wanna hear about this
new inmate. Aside from how big he is.

160
00:17:58,018 --> 00:18:00,223
Monstrous big. Damn.

161
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:02,333
He seems meek enough.

162
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:04,251
ls he retarded, you figure?

163
00:18:04,923 --> 00:18:07,225
Looks like they sent us
an imbecile to execute.

164
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:10,581
lmbecile or not,
he deserves to fry for what he done.

165
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:15,952
Make your blood curdle.

166
00:18:38,873 --> 00:18:42,805
-What?! For God's sake, what?
-The girls! The girls are gone!

167
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:46,354
Papa! Papa, look! There's blood.

168
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:52,204
Oh, my God.

169
00:18:57,191 --> 00:19:01,123
Goddamn it, woman! Get on that phone.
You tell them we headed west.

170
00:19:01,315 --> 00:19:04,288
You mind what i'm saying!
We headed west!

171
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,781
Central! Are you on the line?

172
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:11,001
Oh, God, please.
Somebody took my little girls.

173
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,564
Katie!

174
00:19:24,523 --> 00:19:26,058
Cora!

175
00:19:55,788 --> 00:19:57,227
Jesus.

176
00:19:58,186 --> 00:19:59,625
Jesus.

177
00:20:09,982 --> 00:20:11,325
I'll kill you!

178
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:16,600
I'll kill you!

179
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,755
I couldn't help it.

180
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,262
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

181
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:56,784
Boy, you under arrest for murder.

182
00:20:58,702 --> 00:21:00,236
I interrupt?

183
00:21:01,675 --> 00:21:04,264
Well, I'm just about done.

184
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:17,019
How's your pretty gal?

185
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:20,951
Melinda's not so well, Paul.

186
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:22,774
Not so well at all.

187
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:25,939
More headaches?

188
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:29,103
Got laid up with another one yesterday.

189
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,021
Worst one yet.

190
00:21:31,693 --> 00:21:35,529
I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg
next day or so for some tests.

191
00:21:36,488 --> 00:21:39,173
Head x-rays and who knows what else.

192
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:41,955
She is scared to death.

193
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,887
Truth to tell, so am l.

194
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:49,819
lf it's something they can see
on the x-ray...

195
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,120
...maybe they can fix it.

196
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:54,326
Maybe.

197
00:21:58,738 --> 00:22:00,272
This just came in.

198
00:22:00,464 --> 00:22:02,766
DOE on Bitterbuck.

199
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:08,041
You didn't come down here
to hand me a DOE.

200
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:12,932
I had an angry call from the
state capitol about 20 minutes ago.

201
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:15,713
ls it true you ordered Percy Wetmore
off the block?

202
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:17,151
lt is.

203
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:21,371
Now, I'm sure you had reason, Paul...

204
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:25,303
...but like it or not, the wife
of the governor has only one nephew...

205
00:22:25,495 --> 00:22:27,221
...and his name is Percy Wetmore.

206
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:29,331
Little Percy calls his aunt...

207
00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:32,880
...and squeals like a schoolroom sissy.

208
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:38,346
He mention he assaulted a prisoner
this morning out of sheer petulance?

209
00:22:38,538 --> 00:22:41,128
Broke three fingers
on Eduard Delacroix's left hand.

210
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:43,909
I didn't hear that.
I'm sure she didn't either.

211
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:45,923
He is mean, careless and stupid...

212
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,704
...and that's a bad combination
in a place like this.

213
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,389
Sooner or later, he'll get
somebody hurt or worse.

214
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:52,924
Stick with it, Paul.

215
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:54,746
lt may not be much longer.

216
00:22:55,034 --> 00:22:59,254
I have it on good authority that Percy
has an application in at Briar Ridge.

217
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:02,035
Briar Ridge? The mental hospital.

218
00:23:02,227 --> 00:23:03,473
Administration job.

219
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:05,104
Better pay.

220
00:23:06,638 --> 00:23:08,652
Then why is he still here?

221
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,680
He can get that application
pushed through.

222
00:23:14,886 --> 00:23:17,955
With his connections, he could have
any state job he wants.

223
00:23:18,722 --> 00:23:20,353
You know what i think?

224
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:25,723
I think he just wants to
see one cook up close.

225
00:23:28,504 --> 00:23:32,341
Well, he'll get his chance, then.
Won't he?

226
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:37,232
Maybe then he'll be satisfied
and move on. ln the meantime...

227
00:23:37,711 --> 00:23:39,054
...you'll keep the peace?

228
00:23:39,246 --> 00:23:40,492
Of course.

229
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:43,082
Of course.

230
00:23:44,712 --> 00:23:45,959
Thank you, Paul.

231
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:50,754
Hal...

232
00:23:52,193 --> 00:23:54,207
...you give Melinda my love, okay?

233
00:23:54,686 --> 00:23:58,714
I'm sure that x-ray will turn out
to be nothing at all.

234
00:24:00,057 --> 00:24:01,208
You bet.

235
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:32,377
The music too loud?

236
00:24:34,295 --> 00:24:37,747
There's just this empty spot
in the bed where my husband sleeps.

237
00:24:40,241 --> 00:24:43,693
He said to tell you he's having
a little trouble with that tonight.

238
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,160
Worried about Melinda and Hal?

239
00:24:49,831 --> 00:24:51,654
ls that what's got you up?

240
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,243
Yeah, that...

241
00:24:55,586 --> 00:24:56,928
...and things.

242
00:24:57,983 --> 00:24:59,422
Things.

243
00:25:03,642 --> 00:25:06,711
We got a new inmate today.

244
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:09,204
Simple-minded fella.

245
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:12,657
Do i wanna know what he did?

246
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:14,671
No.

247
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:18,123
Things that happen in this world.

248
00:25:19,658 --> 00:25:21,768
lt's a wonder God allows it.

249
00:25:25,987 --> 00:25:27,810
Why don't you come to bed?

250
00:25:28,577 --> 00:25:31,550
I think i have something
that'll help you sleep.

251
00:25:32,892 --> 00:25:34,906
You can have all you want.

252
00:25:35,961 --> 00:25:38,359
I still got something wrong
with my waterworks.

253
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:40,469
I don't wanna pass it on to you.

254
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:42,771
Have you seen Doc Bishop yet?

255
00:25:42,962 --> 00:25:44,017
No.

256
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,237
He'll want me to take sulfa tablets...

257
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:50,827
...and i'll spend the week
puking in my office.

258
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:54,950
lt will run its course by itself.
Thank you very much for your concern.

259
00:25:57,732 --> 00:25:59,074
Poor old guy.

260
00:26:25,448 --> 00:26:29,956
The legislature loosened up the purse
strings enough to hire on a new guard.

261
00:26:38,395 --> 00:26:39,546
Look again.

262
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:41,176
He's right...

263
00:26:41,464 --> 00:26:42,519
...there.

264
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:54,124
lt ain't normal for a mouse
to come up on people.

265
00:26:54,891 --> 00:26:57,097
-Maybe it's rabid.
-Oh, my Christ.

266
00:26:57,288 --> 00:26:59,974
-lt could be.
-Oh, the big mouse expert.

267
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:02,180
The Mouse Man.

268
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:05,248
You see him foaming at the mouth,
Mouse Man?

269
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,550
I don't see its mouth at all.

270
00:27:16,277 --> 00:27:20,401
-Brutal, we'll be hip-deep in mice.
-I just wanna see what he'll do.

271
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:22,895
ln the interest of science, like.

272
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,654
He's in the damn restraint room.

273
00:28:03,846 --> 00:28:06,148
He's chewing the padding
out of the walls...

274
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,162
...making himself a nice little nest.

275
00:28:13,341 --> 00:28:14,779
All right.

276
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:17,464
Let's go get the damn mouse.

277
00:28:28,877 --> 00:28:29,740
Boss.

278
00:28:30,316 --> 00:28:32,138
Saw me a mouse go by.

279
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:34,440
Can't put anything over on you.

280
00:29:06,472 --> 00:29:08,198
You let him get past you.

281
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,691
No, I did not.
I been here all the time.

282
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:12,705
Then where the hell is he?

283
00:29:12,897 --> 00:29:14,336
Well, I don't know.

284
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:18,460
Three grown men...

285
00:29:19,227 --> 00:29:21,625
...outsmarted by a mouse.

286
00:29:24,118 --> 00:29:28,721
Bright side is, all this commotion
probably scared him off for good.

287
00:29:31,215 --> 00:29:33,996
Yeah, that's the last
we'll see of him.

288
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:25,881
You little son of a bitch.

289
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:29,237
Well, I'll be damned.

290
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:34,032
There he is, big as Billy-be-frigged.
I thought Brutal was pulling my leg.

291
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:36,814
That's a goddamn mouse.

292
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,842
Brute said he was
in here last night...

293
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:42,568
...begging for food.

294
00:30:43,047 --> 00:30:45,157
He come right on up to the desk.

295
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:47,363
Give him some room.

296
00:30:48,034 --> 00:30:49,665
See what he does.

297
00:31:01,077 --> 00:31:04,530
He's a brave little bastard.
Gotta give him that.

298
00:31:31,863 --> 00:31:33,301
Goddamn!

299
00:31:34,165 --> 00:31:35,891
You little scurvy!

300
00:31:36,946 --> 00:31:39,823
Percy, are you crazy,
you little son of a bitch?!

301
00:31:40,206 --> 00:31:42,029
I'm gonna kill you!

302
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:45,577
I'm gonna take you out!

303
00:31:46,728 --> 00:31:50,085
You little vermin!
I'm gonna stomp your life out!

304
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:52,290
lt's just a little mouse, dumb merde.

305
00:31:52,482 --> 00:31:54,113
You ugly little piece of sh--

306
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:56,894
-Are you listening to me?
-Fuck!

307
00:31:58,141 --> 00:32:00,634
I'm gonna rip your diseased head off...

308
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:02,265
...you little piece of shit!

309
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,610
Percy met your mouse.

310
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,132
lt's in here somewhere. I'm gonna
squish the little son of a bitch.

311
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:35,831
Percy, we already tried that.

312
00:32:39,188 --> 00:32:40,530
What'd you say?

313
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:42,161
I said that we--

314
00:32:46,285 --> 00:32:48,874
I Knock yourself out.
Hope you nail the bastard.

315
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:05,370
Gosh. He ain't in there, huh?

316
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:08,534
Don't that beat the mousy band?

317
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:16,399
You wanna think about
what you were doing?

318
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:20,043
I was trying to get the mouse.
Are you blind?

319
00:33:20,235 --> 00:33:23,591
You also scared the living crap
out of me and Bill...

320
00:33:23,783 --> 00:33:25,318
...not to mention the inmates.

321
00:33:25,605 --> 00:33:26,852
So what?

322
00:33:27,044 --> 00:33:30,401
They aren't in cradle school,
case you didn't notice.

323
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:32,990
Although you treat them that way.

324
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:36,155
We don't scare them
any more than we have to.

325
00:33:36,443 --> 00:33:37,881
They're under enough strain.

326
00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:40,183
Men under strain can snap.

327
00:33:40,758 --> 00:33:43,731
Hurt themselves and hurt others.
That's why our job is...

328
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,033
...talking...

329
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,239
...not yelling.

330
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,171
You'd do better to think of this place
like an intensive care ward.

331
00:33:52,651 --> 00:33:55,719
I think of it as a bucket of piss
to drown rats in.

332
00:33:56,295 --> 00:33:57,542
That's all.

333
00:33:58,405 --> 00:34:00,515
Anybody doesn't like it?

334
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,816
You can kiss my ass.

335
00:34:04,063 --> 00:34:05,789
You try it. Go on.

336
00:34:05,981 --> 00:34:09,530
Try it. You'll be on the bread lines
before the week is out.

337
00:34:09,722 --> 00:34:11,256
Okay, Brutal.

338
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:25,354
We all know who your connections are.

339
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:29,861
You ever threaten a man on this block
again, we all gonna have a go.

340
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:31,492
Job be damned.

341
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:35,424
You done?

342
00:34:38,397 --> 00:34:42,329
Get all this shit back in the room.
You are cluttering up my Mile.

343
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,771
Arlen...

344
00:35:05,154 --> 00:35:07,456
...your daughter and her family
are here.

345
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:17,430
Let's move. I want at least two
rehearsals before he gets back.

346
00:35:20,403 --> 00:35:22,801
Sitting down, sitting down!

347
00:35:22,993 --> 00:35:24,623
Rehearsing now! Everybody settle!

348
00:35:24,815 --> 00:35:26,637
Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.

349
00:35:27,116 --> 00:35:30,281
Stepping forward, stepping forward,
stepping forward.

350
00:35:30,473 --> 00:35:33,638
-ls his head properly shaved?
-lt's all dandruffy, and it smells.

351
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,268
I will take that as a yes.

352
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,707
Let's go, Arlen.

353
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:40,447
Walking the Mile, walking the Mile...

354
00:35:40,735 --> 00:35:44,283
...walking the Mile, walking the Mile,
walking the Mile...

355
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,297
...walking the Mile.

356
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:49,366
I'm getting to my knees.
I'm praying, praying.

357
00:35:49,654 --> 00:35:52,243
Lord is my shepherd
and so forth and so on.

358
00:35:52,435 --> 00:35:56,751
I'm sorry for all the bad shit
I've done and people i've tramped on.

359
00:35:56,943 --> 00:35:59,244
And i hope they forgive me...

360
00:35:59,436 --> 00:36:02,122
...and i'll never do it again,
that's for sure.

361
00:36:03,176 --> 00:36:06,054
We're not gonna have some
Cherokee medicine man in here...

362
00:36:06,245 --> 00:36:08,068
...hollering and shaking his dick.

363
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:10,753
-Actually--
-Still praying, still praying.

364
00:36:10,945 --> 00:36:12,959
-Getting right with Jesus.
-Do it quietly!

365
00:36:13,246 --> 00:36:14,589
You old gink!

366
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:15,932
As i was saying...

367
00:36:16,124 --> 00:36:18,713
...I don't believe they actually
shake their dicks.

368
00:36:18,905 --> 00:36:22,261
Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian,
so Reverend Schuster's coming in.

369
00:36:22,453 --> 00:36:25,810
He's good. He's fast too.
Doesn't get them all worked up.

370
00:36:26,002 --> 00:36:28,783
On your feet, Toot.
You prayed enough for one day.

371
00:36:28,975 --> 00:36:31,660
Getting to my feet!
Walking the Mile...

372
00:36:31,852 --> 00:36:35,017
...walking the Mile,
walking the Green Mile.

373
00:36:35,209 --> 00:36:37,031
Walking the Mile.

374
00:36:37,223 --> 00:36:38,853
Walking in the Mile.

375
00:36:39,428 --> 00:36:41,634
Sitting down now.

376
00:36:42,305 --> 00:36:45,566
Sitting down.
I'm taking a seat in Old Sparky.

377
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:46,909
What do i do?

378
00:36:47,964 --> 00:36:49,498
Watch and learn.

379
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,554
Getting strapped.

380
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,240
Getting clamped.

381
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,404
Getting wired.

382
00:37:05,227 --> 00:37:06,473
All right.

383
00:37:07,432 --> 00:37:09,638
Getting all electrode.

384
00:37:15,105 --> 00:37:16,064
Roll on one.

385
00:37:17,023 --> 00:37:19,900
"Roll on one" means i turn
the generator up full.

386
00:37:20,092 --> 00:37:22,202
The lights go brighter
in half the prison.

387
00:37:22,394 --> 00:37:24,024
Arlen Bitterbuck...

388
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,805
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury...

389
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:30,066
...sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

390
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:32,943
Anything to say before
your sentence is carried out?

391
00:37:34,765 --> 00:37:39,369
I want fried chicken with gravy on the
taters, and i want to shit in your hat.

392
00:37:39,848 --> 00:37:41,958
I got to have Mae West
sit on my face...

393
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,739
...because I'm one horny motherfucker.

394
00:37:49,247 --> 00:37:50,206
You bastard.

395
00:37:50,973 --> 00:37:52,699
That's a good one.

396
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,234
Quiet.

397
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:55,672
Quiet! Shut up!

398
00:37:55,864 --> 00:37:58,262
-Shut up!
-Sorry, boss.

399
00:37:58,454 --> 00:38:02,482
One more remark like that, I'll
have Van Hay roll on two for real.

400
00:38:02,673 --> 00:38:05,071
And i'll have one less
crazy old trustee.

401
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:07,181
lt was pretty funny.

402
00:38:07,373 --> 00:38:09,770
I don't like it.
We'll be doing this for real.

403
00:38:10,346 --> 00:38:14,182
I don't want anybody remembering
a stupid joke and getting going again.

404
00:38:14,757 --> 00:38:16,580
Ever try not to laugh in church...

405
00:38:16,771 --> 00:38:19,073
...when something funny gets stuck
in your head?

406
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:21,854
I'm sorry, Paul. You're right.

407
00:38:22,142 --> 00:38:23,581
Let's keep going.

408
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,869
Soak the sponge.

409
00:38:33,555 --> 00:38:35,952
Putting on the black hood.

410
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,268
And putting on my cap.

411
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,378
Why's he putting that sponge
on his head?

412
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,447
Conducts electricity to the brain
fast like a bullet.

413
00:38:46,502 --> 00:38:49,475
You don't ever throw the switch
on a man without that.

414
00:38:52,256 --> 00:38:54,078
Hush up there, Toot.

415
00:38:56,764 --> 00:38:58,777
Getting screwed.

416
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,559
I'm getting the cap.

417
00:39:05,395 --> 00:39:06,929
Arlen Bitterbuck...

418
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:10,382
...electricity shall be passed through
your body until you are dead...

419
00:39:10,574 --> 00:39:12,780
...in accordance with state law.

420
00:39:13,163 --> 00:39:15,465
God have mercy on your soul.

421
00:39:16,712 --> 00:39:18,054
Amen.

422
00:39:20,356 --> 00:39:21,411
Roll on two.

423
00:39:25,343 --> 00:39:26,782
And that's that.

424
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,824
I'm frying! I'm frying!

425
00:39:34,454 --> 00:39:37,523
I'm a done tom turkey!

426
00:39:39,057 --> 00:39:41,839
This is a shocking experience!

427
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:45,483
One of the witnesses
showed up a day early.

428
00:39:52,196 --> 00:39:54,786
Let's do it again,
and let's get it right this time.

429
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:57,279
Get that idiot out of the chair.

430
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:59,425
Do you think if a man sincerely
repents on what he done wrong...

431
00:41:00,384 --> 00:41:03,741
...that he might get to go back to
the time that was happiest for him...

432
00:41:04,316 --> 00:41:06,043
...and live there forever?

433
00:41:08,344 --> 00:41:10,262
Could that be what heaven's like?

434
00:41:11,605 --> 00:41:14,099
I just about believe that very thing.

435
00:41:19,949 --> 00:41:23,114
Had me a young wife when i was 1 8.

436
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:28,197
Spent our first summer in the mountains.
Made love every night.

437
00:41:28,868 --> 00:41:31,841
And she'd lie there after...

438
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,006
...bare-breasted in the firelight.

439
00:41:36,253 --> 00:41:39,322
And we'd talk sometimes
till the sun come up.

440
00:41:42,486 --> 00:41:44,596
That was my best time.

441
00:42:03,777 --> 00:42:05,408
lt'll be fine.

442
00:42:06,654 --> 00:42:08,189
You'll do fine.

443
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,455
Arlen Bitterbuck, electricity shall
now be passed through your body...

444
00:42:46,646 --> 00:42:50,483
...until you are dead,
in accordance with state law.

445
00:42:50,674 --> 00:42:52,976
God have mercy on your soul.

446
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:13,020
Roll on two.

447
00:43:56,081 --> 00:43:56,849
Again.

448
00:44:03,466 --> 00:44:05,096
Adios, chief.

449
00:44:05,384 --> 00:44:09,796
Drop us a card from hell.
Let us know if it's hot enough.

450
00:44:12,289 --> 00:44:14,399
He's paid what he owed.

451
00:44:14,783 --> 00:44:16,988
He's square with the house again...

452
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,770
...so keep your goddamn hands off him!

453
00:44:39,046 --> 00:44:40,869
What's up his ass?

454
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,307
You.

455
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:45,760
Always. You, Percy.

456
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:49,308
You gotta hate the new boy?
That the way it is around here?

457
00:44:51,226 --> 00:44:54,391
Why don't you just move on?
Take that job at Briar Ridge?

458
00:44:54,967 --> 00:44:57,652
Oh, yeah. I know all about it.

459
00:44:58,131 --> 00:45:01,296
Sounds to me like a pretty good job.

460
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:05,900
I might just take it too,
soon as you put me out front.

461
00:45:07,051 --> 00:45:08,393
Yeah, you heard me.

462
00:45:08,969 --> 00:45:11,462
I want Brutal's spot
for the next execution.

463
00:45:14,723 --> 00:45:19,039
Seeing a man die, that's not enough.
You gotta smell his nuts cook.

464
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,532
I just wanna be out front, is all.

465
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:24,697
Come on. One time.

466
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,286
And then you know what?

467
00:45:27,478 --> 00:45:30,259
You'll be rid of me. I swear.

468
00:45:30,451 --> 00:45:32,178
And if i say no?

469
00:45:33,328 --> 00:45:36,685
Well, i might just
stick around for good.

470
00:45:37,452 --> 00:45:39,274
Make me a career of this...

471
00:45:40,521 --> 00:45:41,864
...boss.

472
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:33,748
You won't believe this.

473
00:46:43,818 --> 00:46:45,065
Look.

474
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:48,997
I done tame me that mouse.

475
00:46:49,956 --> 00:46:51,299
We see that.

476
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:55,518
Watch this. Watch what he do.

477
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,821
Ain't he something now?

478
00:47:05,684 --> 00:47:07,890
He's smart, Mr. Jingles.

479
00:47:08,082 --> 00:47:10,096
-Mr. Jingles?
-That his name.

480
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,589
He whispered in my ear.

481
00:47:13,069 --> 00:47:14,124
Hey, captain...

482
00:47:14,316 --> 00:47:17,864
...could i have a box for my mouse
so he can sleep in here with me?

483
00:47:18,056 --> 00:47:20,550
Your English gets better
when you want something.

484
00:47:20,741 --> 00:47:22,659
Wanna see what else he can do?

485
00:47:24,578 --> 00:47:25,537
Watch, watch.

486
00:47:25,728 --> 00:47:28,606
Mr. Jingle? Mr. Jingle,
wanna play fetch?

487
00:47:28,989 --> 00:47:30,332
Wanna play fetch?

488
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:33,305
Play fetch. Watch, watch, watch.

489
00:47:52,294 --> 00:47:54,500
He fetch it every time. Every time.

490
00:47:55,267 --> 00:47:59,774
That's some smart mouse, Del.
Like he a circus mouse or something.

491
00:48:01,884 --> 00:48:04,953
Correct. That just what he is too.
He's a circus mouse.

492
00:48:05,145 --> 00:48:07,063
When i get out,
he'll make me rich.

493
00:48:07,447 --> 00:48:09,653
You just watch and see
if he don't do that.

494
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,050
We play fetch again?

495
00:48:12,722 --> 00:48:14,448
Well, well, well.

496
00:48:14,927 --> 00:48:17,037
Looks like you found yourself
a new friend.

497
00:48:17,613 --> 00:48:18,955
Don't hurt him.

498
00:48:21,449 --> 00:48:22,792
ls that the one i chased?

499
00:48:23,175 --> 00:48:24,710
Yeah, that's the one.

500
00:48:25,189 --> 00:48:28,354
Only Del says his name is Mr. Jingles.

501
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:30,368
ls that so?

502
00:48:31,615 --> 00:48:33,149
Del's been asking for a box.

503
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:35,643
Thinks the mouse will sleep in it.

504
00:48:36,026 --> 00:48:37,657
Might keep it for a pet.

505
00:48:39,863 --> 00:48:41,109
What do you think?

506
00:48:42,356 --> 00:48:46,000
You know what?
We ought to find a cigar box...

507
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,892
...and get some cotton batting
from the dispensary to line it with.

508
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,070
That should do real nice.

509
00:49:05,085 --> 00:49:07,387
Man said get a cigar box.

510
00:49:22,636 --> 00:49:24,074
Hal, you wanted to see me?

511
00:49:26,568 --> 00:49:28,102
Close the door.

512
00:49:35,103 --> 00:49:36,734
So you know...

513
00:49:38,172 --> 00:49:40,570
...you got a new prisoner
coming in here tomorrow.

514
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:43,255
"William Wharton."

515
00:49:43,927 --> 00:49:45,557
He's what you call...

516
00:49:45,845 --> 00:49:47,763
...a problem child.

517
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:52,079
Got "Billy the Kid" tattooed
on his left arm.

518
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:56,202
Been rambling all over the state
last few years...

519
00:49:56,586 --> 00:49:58,696
...causing all kinds of trouble.

520
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,285
Finally hit the big time.

521
00:50:02,628 --> 00:50:05,793
Killed three people in a holdup.

522
00:50:06,081 --> 00:50:08,095
One of them a pregnant woman.

523
00:50:10,492 --> 00:50:12,410
Bad news all around.

524
00:50:26,221 --> 00:50:27,467
lt's a tumor, Paul.

525
00:50:29,002 --> 00:50:30,728
A brain tumor.

526
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:33,509
They got...

527
00:50:34,277 --> 00:50:36,291
...x-ray pictures of it.

528
00:50:37,633 --> 00:50:40,031
lt's the size of a lemon, they said.

529
00:50:42,716 --> 00:50:43,867
And...

530
00:50:45,018 --> 00:50:46,456
...way down...

531
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:50,388
...deep inside,
where they can't operate.

532
00:50:52,307 --> 00:50:53,937
I haven't told her.

533
00:50:55,567 --> 00:50:57,485
I can't think how.

534
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:03,144
For the life of me, Paul...

535
00:51:04,582 --> 00:51:07,459
...I can't think how to
tell my wife...

536
00:51:10,816 --> 00:51:12,734
...she's going to die.

537
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:35,883
Oh, oh, God.

538
00:52:36,555 --> 00:52:37,993
Oh, God.

539
00:52:41,734 --> 00:52:43,076
I'm going.

540
00:52:43,268 --> 00:52:44,131
What?

541
00:52:44,323 --> 00:52:47,104
To see Dr. Bishop. I'm going.

542
00:52:47,488 --> 00:52:48,830
Today.

543
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:51,995
Soon as we get that new inmate
squared away.

544
00:52:52,283 --> 00:52:53,434
That bad?

545
00:52:54,105 --> 00:52:55,544
Oh, yeah.

546
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:18,753
The boy's doped to the gills.

547
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:22,781
Hand me them clothes.

548
00:53:25,754 --> 00:53:27,576
William Wharton?

549
00:53:29,302 --> 00:53:31,028
You put on these clothes now.

550
00:53:38,797 --> 00:53:39,948
We'll have to do this.

551
00:53:42,057 --> 00:53:43,592
Hellraiser, huh?

552
00:53:43,784 --> 00:53:46,373
Look more like a limp noodle to me.

553
00:53:50,017 --> 00:53:53,662
You've been declared competent, son.
You know what that means?

554
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:55,964
You're gonna ride the lightning.

555
00:53:58,937 --> 00:54:00,471
Shut up, give us a hand.

556
00:54:01,334 --> 00:54:02,965
Hellraiser.

557
00:54:32,695 --> 00:54:34,134
You don't look so good.

558
00:54:35,956 --> 00:54:37,874
Look like you're running you a fever.

559
00:54:43,436 --> 00:54:44,971
Boss Edgecomb?

560
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:48,231
I needs to see you down here.

561
00:54:50,725 --> 00:54:52,931
I got things to tend to, John Coffey.

562
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,685
You just stay still in your cell.

563
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:10,961
E Block.

564
00:55:45,774 --> 00:55:47,213
Come on, let's go.

565
00:55:48,364 --> 00:55:50,378
Come on. Look alive, big boy.

566
00:56:04,476 --> 00:56:05,626
Careful.

567
00:56:08,983 --> 00:56:09,846
Careful.

568
00:56:10,038 --> 00:56:10,901
Step up.

569
00:56:11,189 --> 00:56:12,052
Step up.

570
00:56:51,085 --> 00:56:52,332
Ain't this a party now?

571
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:53,866
-ls it or what?
-Let him go.

572
00:56:54,058 --> 00:56:55,593
-Shoot him.
-See who you hit.

573
00:56:55,784 --> 00:56:57,223
Shoot the son of a bitch.

574
00:56:57,511 --> 00:56:58,278
Shoot him!

575
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:01,059
Hit him, Percy!
Goddamn it! Hit him.

576
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,690
Hit me, you limp noodle.

577
00:57:02,881 --> 00:57:03,744
Hit him, Percy!

578
00:57:03,936 --> 00:57:04,991
Goddamn it, hit him!

579
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,526
Come on, Percy. Hit me.

580
00:57:07,293 --> 00:57:08,060
I'm warning you.

581
00:57:08,252 --> 00:57:09,595
You warning me?

582
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:11,033
I'm warning you!

583
00:57:11,225 --> 00:57:13,143
-You're warning me?!
-Shoot him!

584
00:57:13,335 --> 00:57:14,678
Well, come on--

585
00:57:20,911 --> 00:57:21,966
You're a big fucker.

586
00:57:23,117 --> 00:57:24,460
Where'd you come from?

587
00:57:34,722 --> 00:57:37,023
Come on, Dean.
Come on, boy, get up.

588
00:57:37,311 --> 00:57:38,750
All right. Let it breathe.

589
00:57:39,325 --> 00:57:41,339
That's it. Just breathe.
Just breathe.

590
00:57:43,161 --> 00:57:44,792
Breathe. Breathe, boy.

591
00:57:44,983 --> 00:57:47,861
-Didn't see it coming.
-Come on, boy, breathe.

592
00:57:48,052 --> 00:57:49,970
Come on. Just breathe.

593
00:57:52,752 --> 00:57:54,766
We thought he was doped.

594
00:57:56,012 --> 00:57:59,081
Didn't we? Didn't we, all of us,
think he was doped?

595
00:57:59,273 --> 00:58:00,999
You didn't ask?

596
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:03,972
I guess that's not a mistake...

597
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:07,425
...you'll be needing to make again
anytime soon, is it?

598
00:58:20,948 --> 00:58:24,400
You go get Dean and Harry looked at.
Make sure they're all right.

599
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,236
Percy, you make the report
to the warden for me.

600
00:58:28,428 --> 00:58:30,922
Say the situation's under control.
lt's not a story.

601
00:58:31,113 --> 00:58:33,607
He won't appreciate you
drawing out the suspense.

602
00:58:33,799 --> 00:58:36,005
What about you?
You're about to collapse.

603
00:58:36,196 --> 00:58:39,361
I've got the Mile
till you all come back.

604
00:58:40,128 --> 00:58:42,047
Go on now. Go.

605
00:58:49,431 --> 00:58:52,404
Come on, boy.
Let's get you looked at.

606
00:59:16,956 --> 00:59:20,216
Boss, I needs to see you down here.

607
00:59:23,669 --> 00:59:26,738
This is not a good time, John Coffey...

608
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,848
...not a good time at all.

609
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,972
But i needs to see you, boss.
I needs to talk to you.

610
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:55,413
Closer.

611
00:59:55,893 --> 00:59:57,907
You know you ain't
supposed to do that.

612
00:59:59,441 --> 01:00:01,359
Mind your business, Del.

613
01:00:10,566 --> 01:00:12,484
What do you want, John Coffey?

614
01:00:13,539 --> 01:00:14,594
Just to help it.

615
01:00:18,143 --> 01:00:19,485
Don't be afraid.

616
01:00:20,061 --> 01:00:21,020
Help!

617
01:00:21,787 --> 01:00:22,650
Help!

618
01:00:22,842 --> 01:00:24,472
Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

619
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:26,103
Help!

620
01:00:26,295 --> 01:00:27,350
What are you doing?

621
01:00:31,953 --> 01:00:33,679
Boss Howell! Help!

622
01:00:34,351 --> 01:00:35,981
Boss Stanton! Somebody, come!

623
01:00:54,011 --> 01:00:56,121
Help! Boss Howell! Boss Stanton!

624
01:00:56,313 --> 01:00:59,190
Somebody, come!
John Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

625
01:00:59,382 --> 01:01:01,875
Del, for chrissakes, shut up!

626
01:01:46,567 --> 01:01:48,677
What did you just do to me?

627
01:01:50,595 --> 01:01:52,225
I helped it.

628
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,814
Didn't i help it?

629
01:01:55,869 --> 01:01:57,979
I just took it back, is all.

630
01:01:58,747 --> 01:02:01,144
Awful tired now, boss.

631
01:02:01,624 --> 01:02:03,254
Dog-tired.

632
01:02:26,463 --> 01:02:29,340
Boss, what that man do to you?

633
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,870
Hey, honey. How you feeling?

634
01:03:33,596 --> 01:03:36,281
Oh, not too bad.

635
01:03:37,432 --> 01:03:39,158
What did the doctor say?

636
01:03:41,268 --> 01:03:42,995
You know doctors.

637
01:03:43,378 --> 01:03:45,200
Gobbledygook, mostly.

638
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:47,598
Gobbledygook.

639
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:03,710
Having stew tonight.

640
01:04:13,588 --> 01:04:15,219
What are you doing?

641
01:04:21,644 --> 01:04:23,466
What does it feel like?

642
01:04:24,329 --> 01:04:26,631
Well, I know what it feels like.

643
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:32,002
lt feels great.

644
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:09,884
Not that i'm complaining...

645
01:05:10,939 --> 01:05:14,487
...but we haven't gone four times
in one night since we were 1 9.

646
01:05:14,775 --> 01:05:16,981
Yeah, we did, at your mom's.

647
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,338
Wanna tell me what's going on?

648
01:05:23,982 --> 01:05:25,037
Well...

649
01:05:26,571 --> 01:05:28,490
...see, the thing is...

650
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:33,093
...I never actually made it in
to Dr. Bishop's yesterday.

651
01:05:36,162 --> 01:05:38,847
Brutal, Paul. Listen.

652
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:43,259
I'm thinking of taking the morning
off sick. You cover the fort for me?

653
01:05:44,314 --> 01:05:46,424
That's swell. Thanks.

654
01:05:46,615 --> 01:05:49,205
Yeah, I'm sure i'll feel better.

655
01:05:57,069 --> 01:05:58,987
You're sure you ought to do this?

656
01:06:00,522 --> 01:06:02,632
I'm not sure what i'm sure of.

657
01:06:18,743 --> 01:06:21,621
Burt, you got some company.

658
01:06:22,292 --> 01:06:23,826
Can i offer you a cold drink?

659
01:06:24,018 --> 01:06:26,991
Yes, ma'am. A cold drink
would be fine. Thank you.

660
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:30,348
Mr. Hammersmith, your office said
I might find you at home.

661
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:32,074
Hope i'm not troubling you.

662
01:06:32,746 --> 01:06:34,760
Well, that depends, Mr...?

663
01:06:34,951 --> 01:06:38,788
Paul Edgecomb. I'm E Block supervisor
up on Cold Mountain.

664
01:06:40,034 --> 01:06:41,281
The Green Mile.

665
01:06:41,473 --> 01:06:44,446
Yeah, I've heard of it.
Lost a few clients your way.

666
01:06:45,213 --> 01:06:46,939
I'd like to ask you about one.

667
01:06:48,953 --> 01:06:50,871
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

668
01:06:55,379 --> 01:06:56,338
Which client?

669
01:06:58,544 --> 01:07:01,229
Now you got my curiosity aroused.

670
01:07:01,421 --> 01:07:02,668
John Coffey.

671
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:04,874
Coffey.

672
01:07:05,353 --> 01:07:06,504
Causing you problems?

673
01:07:06,983 --> 01:07:10,340
Can't say he is. He doesn't like
the dark and cries on occasion...

674
01:07:10,628 --> 01:07:12,354
...but other than that....

675
01:07:12,546 --> 01:07:15,711
He cries, does he?
Got a lot to cry about, I'd say.

676
01:07:15,903 --> 01:07:17,341
You know what he did.

677
01:07:18,012 --> 01:07:20,026
I read the court transcript.

678
01:07:20,890 --> 01:07:21,657
Thank you, missus.

679
01:07:21,849 --> 01:07:23,479
My pleasure.

680
01:07:24,342 --> 01:07:25,109
Kids!

681
01:07:25,301 --> 01:07:27,507
Lunch is about ready.
Y'all come on up.

682
01:07:27,699 --> 01:07:28,946
Coming, Mama!

683
01:07:29,137 --> 01:07:32,206
What exactly are you
trying to find out?

684
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:34,988
I wonder if he did anything
like that before.

685
01:07:36,426 --> 01:07:38,248
Why? Has he said anything?

686
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,509
No, but a man who does
a thing like that...

687
01:07:41,701 --> 01:07:45,441
...has often developed a taste for it
over time. lt occurred to me...

688
01:07:45,633 --> 01:07:49,373
...that it might be easy enough to
follow his back trail. Find out.

689
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:53,785
A man his size, and colored to boot,
can't be that hard to trace.

690
01:07:53,977 --> 01:07:56,854
You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.

691
01:07:57,046 --> 01:07:59,060
Believe me, we tried.

692
01:07:59,923 --> 01:08:02,033
Like he'd dropped out of the sky.

693
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,142
How can that be?

694
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:08,362
We're in a depression.
A third of the country's out of work.

695
01:08:08,554 --> 01:08:12,486
People are drifting by the thousands,
looking for jobs, for greener grass.

696
01:08:12,678 --> 01:08:15,651
Even a giant like Coffey
wouldn't get noticed everywhere.

697
01:08:16,418 --> 01:08:18,720
Not until he kills
a couple of little girls.

698
01:08:19,487 --> 01:08:21,022
He is...

699
01:08:21,309 --> 01:08:23,323
...strange, I admit.

700
01:08:23,707 --> 01:08:27,831
But there doesn't seem to be
any real violence in him.

701
01:08:28,214 --> 01:08:30,516
I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith.

702
01:08:30,804 --> 01:08:33,489
I deal with them day in and day out.

703
01:08:34,256 --> 01:08:36,846
You didn't come to ask me
whether he killed before.

704
01:08:37,038 --> 01:08:39,819
You came to see if i think
he did it at all.

705
01:08:41,162 --> 01:08:42,025
Do you?

706
01:08:43,943 --> 01:08:46,053
One seldom sees a less ambiguous case.

707
01:08:46,245 --> 01:08:48,163
He was found with the victims
in his arms.

708
01:08:48,450 --> 01:08:50,177
And yet you defended him.

709
01:08:51,136 --> 01:08:53,629
Everyone is entitled to a defense.

710
01:08:54,013 --> 01:08:55,547
Kids! Lunch!

711
01:08:55,739 --> 01:08:56,986
Y'all listen to your mama!

712
01:09:01,397 --> 01:09:02,932
I'll tell you something.

713
01:09:03,987 --> 01:09:07,439
You listen close too, because it
might be something you need to know.

714
01:09:07,631 --> 01:09:08,878
I'm listening.

715
01:09:10,317 --> 01:09:11,276
We had us a dog.

716
01:09:12,331 --> 01:09:14,249
Just a sweet mongrel.

717
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,879
You know the kind.

718
01:09:17,222 --> 01:09:20,482
Well, in many ways,
a good mongrel dog is like a Negro.

719
01:09:21,346 --> 01:09:23,072
You get to know it.

720
01:09:23,264 --> 01:09:27,388
Often, you get to love it.
lt is of no particular use...

721
01:09:27,579 --> 01:09:31,032
...but you keep it around
because you think it loves you.

722
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:36,403
lf you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you
never have to find out any different.

723
01:09:37,457 --> 01:09:39,567
My wife and i were not so lucky.

724
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:42,924
Caleb, come here for a second.

725
01:09:44,267 --> 01:09:45,418
Come here.

726
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,007
Please, son.

727
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:51,939
He still has the one good eye.

728
01:09:53,186 --> 01:09:55,392
I suppose he's lucky...

729
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,885
...not to be completely blind.

730
01:10:00,475 --> 01:10:04,023
We get down on our knees and thank God
for that much at least.

731
01:10:04,694 --> 01:10:06,037
Right, Caleb?

732
01:10:08,722 --> 01:10:09,681
Go on in, now.

733
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:15,723
That dog attacked my boy
for no reason.

734
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:18,409
Just got it in his mind one day.

735
01:10:19,176 --> 01:10:20,614
The same with John Coffey.

736
01:10:20,806 --> 01:10:24,834
He was sorry afterwards.
Of that i have no doubt.

737
01:10:25,506 --> 01:10:27,328
But those little girls...

738
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,821
...stayed raped and murdered.

739
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:32,411
Maybe he'd never done it before.

740
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:36,151
My dog never bit before.

741
01:10:37,781 --> 01:10:40,467
But i didn't concern myself with that.

742
01:10:41,426 --> 01:10:45,166
I went out with my rifle, grabbed
his collar and blew his brains out.

743
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:47,660
ls Coffey guilty?

744
01:10:50,441 --> 01:10:52,071
Yes, he is.

745
01:10:52,742 --> 01:10:54,277
Don't you doubt it.

746
01:10:54,661 --> 01:10:57,058
And don't you turn your back on him.

747
01:10:57,825 --> 01:11:01,853
You may get away with it once
or even a hundred times...

748
01:11:02,621 --> 01:11:04,251
...but in the end...

749
01:11:06,169 --> 01:11:07,512
...you'll get bit.

750
01:11:19,596 --> 01:11:21,993
Oh, me! Oh, my!

751
01:11:28,611 --> 01:11:30,721
I'm smelling me some corn bread.

752
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,022
lt's from my missus.

753
01:11:36,571 --> 01:11:38,777
She wanted to thank you.

754
01:11:40,119 --> 01:11:41,462
Thank me for what?

755
01:11:41,846 --> 01:11:43,092
Well, you know.

756
01:11:45,682 --> 01:11:47,024
For helping me.

757
01:11:47,696 --> 01:11:49,230
Helping you with what?

758
01:11:49,902 --> 01:11:50,956
You know.

759
01:11:57,286 --> 01:11:59,204
Was your missus pleased?

760
01:12:00,931 --> 01:12:02,465
Several times.

761
01:12:17,426 --> 01:12:20,783
John, I can smell that from over here.
I surely can.

762
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:25,674
Can i give Del and Mr. Jingles some?

763
01:12:26,249 --> 01:12:29,702
Well, it's yours, John.
You can do with it as you please.

764
01:12:32,675 --> 01:12:35,936
Here. This for Del and Mr. Jingles.

765
01:12:36,703 --> 01:12:40,251
Hey! What about me?
I'm gonna get some too, ain't l?

766
01:12:42,265 --> 01:12:45,238
lt's yours, John. As you please.

767
01:12:45,814 --> 01:12:48,403
I think i'll just keep the rest, then.

768
01:12:53,966 --> 01:12:56,076
Courtesy of the gentleman
across the way.

769
01:12:58,281 --> 01:13:00,967
John, that's so very fine of you.

770
01:13:01,926 --> 01:13:05,666
I thank you. Mr. Jingle thank you.
My mama'd thank you too, but she dead.

771
01:13:06,241 --> 01:13:07,488
Welcome.

772
01:13:08,735 --> 01:13:12,763
What about me? Don't you
hold out on me, you big dummy nigger.

773
01:13:16,599 --> 01:13:18,038
Here come the boss man.

774
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:21,203
You'll keep a civil tongue
on my block.

775
01:13:32,136 --> 01:13:34,150
You get that one for free.

776
01:13:35,109 --> 01:13:36,643
But that's the last one.

777
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:40,192
That's it?
Just that little itty-bitty one?

778
01:13:40,767 --> 01:13:43,932
I guess i'm gonna have to
pay you out for the rest.

779
01:13:57,742 --> 01:13:58,701
Good shot, weren't it?

780
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,921
The look on your face!

781
01:14:07,045 --> 01:14:08,579
You believe this?

782
01:14:08,771 --> 01:14:10,977
That son of a bitch pissed on me.

783
01:14:11,648 --> 01:14:13,566
Did y'all like that?

784
01:14:13,758 --> 01:14:15,964
I'm cooking up some turds
to go with it.

785
01:14:16,156 --> 01:14:17,690
Nice soft ones.

786
01:14:18,745 --> 01:14:20,951
Have them out to y'all tomorrow.

787
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:26,034
We've been meaning to clean out
that room for a while, haven't we?

788
01:14:28,048 --> 01:14:30,446
Be careful with that.
That's fragile.

789
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:34,761
What's it now?
What's it now? Moving day?

790
01:14:34,953 --> 01:14:37,063
Y'all wanna come in here
and dust a little?

791
01:14:37,447 --> 01:14:40,707
You can shine my knob for me
while you're at it.

792
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:55,956
You can come in here on your legs...

793
01:14:56,148 --> 01:14:58,450
...but you'll go out on your backs.

794
01:14:58,641 --> 01:15:01,806
Billy the Kid gonna
guarantee you that.

795
01:15:02,094 --> 01:15:03,053
Come on, fuck-stick.

796
01:15:03,437 --> 01:15:07,369
No sneaking up on me this time.
We'll go man-to-man.

797
01:15:10,725 --> 01:15:11,780
Piss on me?

798
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:39,880
Come on, Wild Bill.
Little walky-walky.

799
01:15:40,072 --> 01:15:44,292
Don't you call me that!
Wild Bill Hickok wasn't no range rider!

800
01:15:44,484 --> 01:15:46,402
He was just some
bushwhacking John Law!

801
01:15:46,594 --> 01:15:50,046
Dumb son of a bitch sat with his back
to the door, killed by a drunk.

802
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:52,060
Oh, my suds and body.
A history lesson.

803
01:15:52,636 --> 01:15:56,376
You never know what you'll get at work
every day on the Green Mile.

804
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:00,020
Thank you, Wild Bill.

805
01:16:07,789 --> 01:16:09,131
Not in there.

806
01:16:09,323 --> 01:16:10,474
I'll be good.

807
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:13,159
Honest injun, i will. i will.

808
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:19,393
He's pitching a fit.

809
01:16:19,585 --> 01:16:22,366
He'll be fine, boys.
Trust me on this one.

810
01:16:30,997 --> 01:16:31,956
Hey, fellers!

811
01:16:38,286 --> 01:16:41,355
All i wanted me was a little
corn bread, you motherfuckers!

812
01:16:41,547 --> 01:16:44,040
All i wanted me was
a little corn bread!

813
01:16:51,617 --> 01:16:53,631
I learned my lesson.

814
01:16:53,919 --> 01:16:55,357
I'll be good.

815
01:17:07,921 --> 01:17:08,880
Hey, Toot.

816
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:12,908
Give you a nickel for that Moon Pie.

817
01:17:50,023 --> 01:17:52,133
Little Black Sambo!

818
01:17:53,283 --> 01:17:56,928
Yes, sir, yes, sir. How do you do?

819
01:17:58,175 --> 01:18:00,380
Hope your bags are packed.

820
01:18:00,668 --> 01:18:02,586
My bags are packed! I'm ready to go!

821
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:04,696
Where are we going? Let's go!

822
01:18:17,547 --> 01:18:19,753
That Moon Pie thing was
pretty original.

823
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:21,479
Gotta give him that.

824
01:18:38,838 --> 01:18:42,387
Del, grab up your things. lt's
a big day for you and Mr. Jingles.

825
01:18:42,578 --> 01:18:43,825
What you talking about?

826
01:18:44,017 --> 01:18:47,565
lmportant folks heard about your mouse.
Wanna see him perform.

827
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:49,100
Not just prison guards.

828
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:52,361
One's a politician all the way
from the state capitol.

829
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:55,813
You fellas coming?

830
01:18:56,005 --> 01:18:59,362
No, we got other fish to fry
just now, Del.

831
01:19:00,417 --> 01:19:02,814
But you knock them for a loop.

832
01:19:03,006 --> 01:19:04,732
You knock them for a loop.

833
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:07,226
Just like Mr. Harry says.

834
01:19:18,447 --> 01:19:20,652
Let's move briskly.
There's not much time.

835
01:19:21,228 --> 01:19:23,721
All right, rehearsing now!

836
01:19:23,913 --> 01:19:26,311
Gotta move our ass.
Ain't got much time.

837
01:19:26,694 --> 01:19:29,859
I been fixing the plumbing here
for 10 years.

838
01:19:30,051 --> 01:19:32,161
Ain't never had to wear no tie before.

839
01:19:32,353 --> 01:19:36,189
Well, you're the VlP today, Earl,
so just shut up.

840
01:19:37,819 --> 01:19:39,833
All right, everybody have a seat.

841
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:56,617
This is great.

842
01:20:05,056 --> 01:20:09,468
Eduard Delacroix, electricity shall
now be passed through your body...

843
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:11,194
...until you are dead...

844
01:20:11,386 --> 01:20:13,592
...in accordance with state law.

845
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,373
God have mercy on your soul.

846
01:20:24,717 --> 01:20:25,772
Roll on two.

847
01:20:29,895 --> 01:20:30,759
That's that.

848
01:20:34,115 --> 01:20:36,992
Very good. Very professional.

849
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:41,020
Let's do it again.

850
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:44,473
You got all the words right.
lt sounded just fine.

851
01:20:44,665 --> 01:20:45,432
Thank you.

852
01:20:45,624 --> 01:20:48,884
lt's hard to keep a straight face
when Toot's acting the goat.

853
01:20:49,172 --> 01:20:52,049
You got that chin strap tight,
because his head will buck--

854
01:20:52,529 --> 01:20:54,255
All right, break it up.

855
01:20:58,187 --> 01:20:59,338
So?

856
01:20:59,530 --> 01:21:02,215
They love Mr. Jingles.
They laugh over there.

857
01:21:02,503 --> 01:21:06,627
They cheer. They clap their hands.

858
01:21:06,819 --> 01:21:08,641
Well, that's just aces.

859
01:21:09,408 --> 01:21:11,038
lsn't that something?

860
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:13,340
You done good, old-timer.

861
01:21:13,532 --> 01:21:15,258
We're happy for you.

862
01:21:16,697 --> 01:21:18,423
Yeah, we are.

863
01:21:34,343 --> 01:21:35,590
Percy, you shit.

864
01:21:38,371 --> 01:21:39,138
Come on.

865
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:40,385
Del, get up.

866
01:21:40,577 --> 01:21:44,030
Del, you numb-wit.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

867
01:21:44,221 --> 01:21:46,907
I was just playing. Come on, now.

868
01:21:47,098 --> 01:21:48,537
I was just having--

869
01:21:51,126 --> 01:21:52,661
Ain't you sweet?

870
01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:55,634
Soft like a girl.

871
01:21:55,826 --> 01:21:57,648
I'd rather fuck your asshole...

872
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,758
...than your sister's pussy, i think.

873
01:22:00,141 --> 01:22:01,292
Wharton!

874
01:22:06,471 --> 01:22:10,211
I let him go. I was just playing.
I let him go.

875
01:22:10,403 --> 01:22:12,801
I'd never hurt a hair
on his pretty head.

876
01:22:13,472 --> 01:22:16,158
Your noodle ain't
limp at all, lover-boy.

877
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:18,939
I think you sweet on
old Billy the Kid.

878
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:23,254
But smell you.

879
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,119
Look.

880
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:32,653
He done piss his pants.

881
01:22:34,763 --> 01:22:36,489
Oh, my God.

882
01:22:37,928 --> 01:22:39,654
Look what the big man done.

883
01:22:39,846 --> 01:22:42,148
He bust other people with a stick.

884
01:22:45,121 --> 01:22:49,245
Somebody touch him, he make water
in his pants like a little baby.

885
01:22:52,026 --> 01:22:53,368
Learn when to shut up.

886
01:22:54,519 --> 01:22:56,150
All right, now.

887
01:22:57,588 --> 01:22:59,123
Don't touch me.

888
01:23:14,755 --> 01:23:17,345
You talk about this to anyone...

889
01:23:17,728 --> 01:23:19,838
...I'll get you all fired.

890
01:23:21,373 --> 01:23:23,003
I swear that to God.

891
01:23:24,537 --> 01:23:28,949
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile. Always has.

892
01:23:35,375 --> 01:23:39,115
Yeah, you keep laughing,
you French-fried faggot!

893
01:23:39,594 --> 01:23:41,704
You just keep on laughing!

894
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:46,883
Wetmore a good name for you!

895
01:23:49,089 --> 01:23:50,911
Percy Wetmore do a dance

896
01:23:51,103 --> 01:23:53,884
Listen to him squishing in his pant

897
01:24:04,721 --> 01:24:07,694
Well, what about Dean?
He's got a little boy.

898
01:24:07,886 --> 01:24:10,380
He'd love to have a pet mouse, I bet.

899
01:24:12,969 --> 01:24:15,654
How could a boy be trusted
with Mr. Jingle?

900
01:24:16,038 --> 01:24:18,340
Maybe forget to feed him.

901
01:24:18,723 --> 01:24:22,368
How he keep up with his training?
He just a boy, n'est-ce pas?

902
01:24:31,958 --> 01:24:34,164
All right. I'll take him, then.

903
01:24:34,835 --> 01:24:35,890
Me.

904
01:24:37,137 --> 01:24:39,535
Merci beaucoup.
Thank you kindly, but...

905
01:24:40,877 --> 01:24:43,083
...you live out in the woods.

906
01:24:43,563 --> 01:24:44,905
Mr. Jingle, he be...

907
01:24:45,577 --> 01:24:48,646
...he be scared to live
out in the big woods.

908
01:24:53,345 --> 01:24:54,975
How about Mouseville?

909
01:24:56,126 --> 01:24:57,085
Mouseville?

910
01:24:57,277 --> 01:24:59,579
Tourist attraction down in Florida.

911
01:25:00,538 --> 01:25:01,976
Tallahassee, I think.

912
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:04,662
ls that right, Paul? Tallahassee?

913
01:25:04,853 --> 01:25:06,004
Tallahassee.

914
01:25:06,196 --> 01:25:09,649
lt's just down the road a piece
from the dog university.

915
01:25:11,854 --> 01:25:15,595
You think they'd take Mr. Jingles?

916
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:17,992
You think he's got the stuff?

917
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,102
I mean, he is pretty smart.

918
01:25:21,349 --> 01:25:22,883
What is Mouseville?

919
01:25:23,171 --> 01:25:25,089
Tourist attraction, I said.

920
01:25:25,377 --> 01:25:27,007
They got this big tent.

921
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:30,172
-You have to pay?
-Are you shitting me? Course you pay.

922
01:25:30,556 --> 01:25:31,419
Dime apiece.

923
01:25:31,803 --> 01:25:34,008
-Two cents for the kids.
-For the kids.

924
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,310
lnside the tent they got this...

925
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:38,324
...mouse city...

926
01:25:39,091 --> 01:25:40,530
...made out of...

927
01:25:40,722 --> 01:25:45,229
...old boxes and toilet paper rolls,
little windows so you can look in.

928
01:25:45,613 --> 01:25:49,833
Plus, they got
the Mouseville All-Star Circus.

929
01:25:50,983 --> 01:25:53,861
Yeah, there's mice
that swing on trapeze.

930
01:25:54,052 --> 01:25:57,409
Mice that roll barrels.
Mice that stack coins.

931
01:26:01,341 --> 01:26:02,300
Yeah, that's it.

932
01:26:04,026 --> 01:26:05,753
That's the place for Mr. Jingles.

933
01:26:10,548 --> 01:26:13,425
You gonna be a circus mouse after all.

934
01:26:13,905 --> 01:26:17,645
You're gonna live in a mouse city
down in Florida.

935
01:26:21,002 --> 01:26:21,769
There he goes.

936
01:26:29,921 --> 01:26:31,935
Mr. Jingles!

937
01:26:41,142 --> 01:26:43,156
I knew i'd get him sooner or later.

938
01:26:43,827 --> 01:26:46,129
lt was just a matter of time, really.

939
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,293
You fucking cruel bastard!

940
01:26:57,541 --> 01:26:58,980
Give him to me.

941
01:26:59,651 --> 01:27:02,145
Give him to me. Might still be time.

942
01:27:14,324 --> 01:27:15,763
What are you doing?

943
01:27:19,216 --> 01:27:20,846
What the hell--?

944
01:27:21,038 --> 01:27:22,764
Please, John.

945
01:27:23,819 --> 01:27:25,066
Help him.

946
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:28,326
Please, Johnny, help him.

947
01:27:32,067 --> 01:27:34,560
Oh, dear Jesus.

948
01:27:34,752 --> 01:27:36,095
The tail.

949
01:27:36,766 --> 01:27:37,821
Look at the tail.

950
01:29:04,615 --> 01:29:05,670
What'd you do?

951
01:29:06,245 --> 01:29:08,834
I helped Del's mouse...

952
01:29:09,218 --> 01:29:10,561
...his circus mouse.

953
01:29:11,136 --> 01:29:13,342
Gonna live in a mouse city...

954
01:29:13,534 --> 01:29:14,972
...down in....

955
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:18,041
Florida.

956
01:29:21,014 --> 01:29:22,836
Boss Percy bad.

957
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:26,960
He mean. He step on Del's mouse.

958
01:29:27,919 --> 01:29:29,646
I took it back, though.

959
01:29:36,743 --> 01:29:37,989
Brute...

960
01:29:38,661 --> 01:29:40,579
...you come along with me.

961
01:29:40,866 --> 01:29:43,935
You fellas go on back
to your cribbage game.

962
01:30:06,952 --> 01:30:09,350
Now, don't start in on me.

963
01:30:09,638 --> 01:30:11,556
lt was just a mouse.

964
01:30:11,844 --> 01:30:14,049
Never belonged here
in the first place.

965
01:30:14,241 --> 01:30:15,967
The mouse is fine.

966
01:30:17,022 --> 01:30:17,790
Just fine.

967
01:30:17,981 --> 01:30:20,475
You're no better at mouse-killing
than you are...

968
01:30:20,954 --> 01:30:22,777
...at anything else around here.

969
01:30:24,887 --> 01:30:27,188
Yeah, you expect me to believe that?

970
01:30:28,915 --> 01:30:31,408
I heard the goddamn thing crunch.

971
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,806
Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is okay?

972
01:30:34,861 --> 01:30:37,066
After all those talks we had about...

973
01:30:37,546 --> 01:30:39,272
...keeping the prisoners calm?

974
01:30:39,944 --> 01:30:42,725
-Aren't you relieved?
-What kind of game is this?

975
01:30:42,917 --> 01:30:44,355
lt's no game.

976
01:30:44,643 --> 01:30:45,986
See for yourself.

977
01:30:48,959 --> 01:30:50,205
Go on.

978
01:31:02,961 --> 01:31:05,742
Don't let nothing
happen to Mr. Jingle.

979
01:31:09,674 --> 01:31:12,935
You switched them. You switched them
somehow, you bastards.

980
01:31:13,606 --> 01:31:17,634
I always keep a spare mouse in
my wallet for occasions such as this.

981
01:31:17,826 --> 01:31:20,415
Yeah, you playing with me.
Both of you.

982
01:31:20,607 --> 01:31:22,909
Just who the hell you think you are?

983
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:27,416
We're the people you work with.

984
01:31:27,896 --> 01:31:29,430
But not for long.

985
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,307
Percy, I want your word.

986
01:31:32,883 --> 01:31:33,746
My word?

987
01:31:34,321 --> 01:31:36,911
I put you out front for Del...

988
01:31:37,774 --> 01:31:40,843
...you put in your transfer
to Briar Ridge the next day.

989
01:31:43,241 --> 01:31:47,556
What if i just call up certain people
and tell them you're harassing me?

990
01:31:47,844 --> 01:31:49,954
-Bullying me.
-Go ahead.

991
01:31:50,817 --> 01:31:53,598
I promise you'll leave your share
of blood on the floor.

992
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:54,941
Over a mouse?

993
01:31:55,133 --> 01:31:56,284
No.

994
01:31:57,051 --> 01:32:01,271
But four men will swear you stood by
while Wild Bill tried to strangle Dean.

995
01:32:01,462 --> 01:32:05,299
About that, people will care.
Even your uncle the governor.

996
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:07,888
Thing like that goes
on your work record.

997
01:32:08,367 --> 01:32:12,491
Work record can follow a man around
for a long, long time.

998
01:32:12,779 --> 01:32:14,505
I put you out front...

999
01:32:14,889 --> 01:32:17,095
...you put in for that transfer.

1000
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:19,876
That's the deal.

1001
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,151
All right.

1002
01:32:34,453 --> 01:32:36,851
You make a promise to a man,
you shake his hand.

1003
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:38,326
Hey, boys.

1004
01:33:39,573 --> 01:33:42,737
No, now, say hey, Mr Jingles.

1005
01:33:44,751 --> 01:33:47,245
Eduard Delacroix,
will you step forward?

1006
01:34:01,247 --> 01:34:02,494
Boss Edgecomb.

1007
01:34:03,165 --> 01:34:04,604
Yes, Del?

1008
01:34:04,795 --> 01:34:07,289
Don't let nothing happen
to Mr. Jingle, okay?

1009
01:34:08,728 --> 01:34:11,413
Here. You take him.

1010
01:34:19,757 --> 01:34:22,730
I can't have a mouse
on my shoulder while...

1011
01:34:24,168 --> 01:34:25,127
...you know.

1012
01:34:27,141 --> 01:34:28,867
I'll take him, boss.

1013
01:34:29,443 --> 01:34:31,841
Just for now, if Del don't mind.

1014
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:40,760
You take him, John. You take him
till this foolishment be done.

1015
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:02,818
You gonna take him to Mouseville?

1016
01:35:03,681 --> 01:35:05,887
We'll do it together, most likely.

1017
01:35:06,942 --> 01:35:09,243
Maybe take a little vacation time.

1018
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:13,175
People pay a dime apiece to see him.

1019
01:35:13,559 --> 01:35:16,244
Two cents for the kids.
Ain't that right, Boss Howell?

1020
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:17,107
That's right, Del.

1021
01:35:20,176 --> 01:35:21,711
You're a good man, Boss Howell.

1022
01:35:25,259 --> 01:35:26,602
You too, Boss Edgecomb.

1023
01:35:30,726 --> 01:35:33,603
I sure wish i could've
met you guys somewheres else.

1024
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:13,116
Hope he's good and scared.

1025
01:36:13,307 --> 01:36:17,911
Hope he knows the fires are stoked
and that Satan's imps are waiting.

1026
01:36:26,734 --> 01:36:28,460
Del, it's all right.

1027
01:37:09,507 --> 01:37:10,658
Roll on one.

1028
01:37:21,975 --> 01:37:24,660
You be still, Mr. Jingles.

1029
01:37:26,003 --> 01:37:29,264
You be so quiet and so still.

1030
01:37:32,812 --> 01:37:34,251
Eduard Delacroix...

1031
01:37:34,634 --> 01:37:37,895
...you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers.

1032
01:37:38,087 --> 01:37:41,731
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1033
01:37:42,115 --> 01:37:44,896
You have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1034
01:37:53,048 --> 01:37:55,062
I sorry for what i--

1035
01:38:01,871 --> 01:38:04,077
l sorry for what i do.

1036
01:38:04,461 --> 01:38:06,762
I give anything to take it back.

1037
01:38:07,721 --> 01:38:09,352
But i can't.

1038
01:38:10,503 --> 01:38:12,613
God have mercy on me.

1039
01:38:13,284 --> 01:38:15,298
Ainsi soit-il. Amen.

1040
01:38:23,546 --> 01:38:25,176
Don't forget about Mouseville.

1041
01:38:30,067 --> 01:38:31,506
There's no such place.

1042
01:38:32,369 --> 01:38:35,917
That's just a fairy tale these guys
told you to keep you quiet.

1043
01:38:38,411 --> 01:38:40,713
Just thought you should know, faggot.

1044
01:39:40,365 --> 01:39:41,420
Eduard Delacroix...

1045
01:39:42,283 --> 01:39:45,640
...electricity shall now be passed
through your body until you are dead...

1046
01:39:46,215 --> 01:39:48,325
...in accordance with state law.

1047
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:51,874
God have mercy on your soul.

1048
01:40:29,468 --> 01:40:30,523
Roll on two!

1049
01:40:46,635 --> 01:40:47,786
The sponge is dry.

1050
01:40:47,978 --> 01:40:48,841
What?

1051
01:40:55,171 --> 01:40:57,760
-The goddamn sponge is dry!
-Well, don't you stop him!

1052
01:40:57,952 --> 01:41:00,541
Don't you do it!
lt's too late for that.

1053
01:41:15,023 --> 01:41:16,461
ls this normal?

1054
01:41:16,653 --> 01:41:19,243
God, the smell.

1055
01:41:20,393 --> 01:41:22,791
He's cooking now!
They cooking him good!

1056
01:41:23,271 --> 01:41:24,805
They're about done, i reckon!

1057
01:41:29,504 --> 01:41:31,902
We're gonna have a hoedown!

1058
01:41:36,697 --> 01:41:38,423
He's cooking now!

1059
01:41:38,711 --> 01:41:40,725
He's cooking now!

1060
01:41:40,917 --> 01:41:43,123
We gonna have a hoedown!

1061

01:41:46,959 --> 01:41:48,302

1063
01:41:48,493 --> 01:41:50,412
I'm smelling gumbo! I'm smelling--

1064
01:41:51,754 --> 01:41:53,672
I said give me some!

1065
01:41:57,125 --> 01:41:59,043
I smell it!

1066
01:42:01,057 --> 01:42:01,920
Smell it!

1067
01:42:09,401 --> 01:42:10,456
Should i kill the juice?

1068
01:42:10,647 --> 01:42:12,086
No! Roll, for chrisssake, roll!

1069
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:36,158
He's frying now!

1070
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:37,884
He's frying now!

1071
01:42:40,665 --> 01:42:42,008
Why don't you shut it down?

1072
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:45,461
He's still alive. You want me to
shut down while he's still alive?

1073
01:42:51,407 --> 01:42:54,092
You watch, you son of a bitch!

1074
01:42:55,435 --> 01:42:58,024
lt's all right, folks!
lt's all under control!

1075
01:42:58,504 --> 01:43:01,285
Everybody stay calm!
Please, stay calm.

1076
01:43:06,943 --> 01:43:07,806
Kill it!

1077
01:43:14,616 --> 01:43:15,479
You do it!

1078
01:43:15,671 --> 01:43:17,589
You're running this show, ain't you?

1079
01:43:44,346 --> 01:43:46,840
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1080
01:43:49,237 --> 01:43:50,292
Brutal!

1081
01:43:50,484 --> 01:43:51,443
Brutal, no!

1082
01:43:52,210 --> 01:43:53,265
What do you mean, no?

1083
01:43:53,457 --> 01:43:55,183
You saw what he did!

1084
01:43:55,375 --> 01:43:58,252
Delacroix's dead!
Percy is not worth it!

1085
01:43:58,444 --> 01:44:00,842
So he just gets away with it!
ls that how it works?

1086
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:12,062
What in the blue fuck was that?

1087
01:44:13,021 --> 01:44:14,364
Jesus Christ.

1088
01:44:14,556 --> 01:44:17,337
There's puke
all over the floor up there.

1089
01:44:17,529 --> 01:44:19,255
And the smell.

1090
01:44:19,831 --> 01:44:23,571
I got Van Hay to open both doors, but
that smell won't go out for 5 years.

1091
01:44:23,763 --> 01:44:25,393
That's what i'm betting.

1092
01:44:26,256 --> 01:44:29,517
And that asshole Wharton
is singing about it!

1093
01:44:29,997 --> 01:44:31,339
You can hear him up there!

1094
01:44:31,915 --> 01:44:34,312
Can he carry a tune, Hal?

1095
01:44:44,574 --> 01:44:46,780
Okay, boys, okay.

1096
01:44:47,259 --> 01:44:50,136
Now, what in the hell happened?

1097
01:44:50,328 --> 01:44:51,863
An execution.

1098
01:44:52,150 --> 01:44:53,205
A successful one.

1099
01:44:53,589 --> 01:44:57,521
How in the name of Christ
can you call that a success?

1100
01:44:58,288 --> 01:45:00,686
Eduard Delacroix is dead.

1101
01:45:02,412 --> 01:45:03,179
lsn't he?

1102
01:45:09,989 --> 01:45:11,140
Something to say?

1103
01:45:14,976 --> 01:45:17,277
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1104
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:21,114
How many years you spend
pissing on the toilet seat...

1105
01:45:21,305 --> 01:45:23,415
...before someone told you
to put it up?

1106
01:45:23,607 --> 01:45:25,333
Percy fucked up, Hal.

1107
01:45:25,525 --> 01:45:27,060
Pure and simple.

1108
01:45:27,635 --> 01:45:29,361
That's your official position?

1109
01:45:29,553 --> 01:45:31,375
Don't you think it should be?

1110
01:45:31,759 --> 01:45:35,691
He's putting in for a transfer request
to Briar Ridge tomorrow.

1111
01:45:35,883 --> 01:45:38,280
Moving on to bigger and better things.

1112
01:45:38,568 --> 01:45:39,911
lsn't that right, Percy?

1113
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:44,610
Barbecue

1114
01:45:44,802 --> 01:45:48,063
Me and you
Stinky, pinky

1115
01:45:49,118 --> 01:45:51,995
Weren't Billy, Jilly, Hilly or Pa

1116
01:45:52,187 --> 01:45:55,064
It was a French-fried Cajun
Named Delacroix

1117
01:45:56,982 --> 01:45:57,845
Barbecue

1118
01:45:58,612 --> 01:45:59,859
Me and you

1119
01:46:00,051 --> 01:46:01,585
Stinky, pinky

1120
01:46:03,503 --> 01:46:04,942
Weren't Billy, Jilly--

1121
01:46:06,093 --> 01:46:09,929
You're 1 0 seconds away from spending the
rest of your life in the padded room.

1122
01:46:27,575 --> 01:46:28,630
Poor old Del.

1123
01:46:32,371 --> 01:46:34,001
Poor old Del.

1124
01:46:39,851 --> 01:46:41,098
You okay?

1125
01:46:42,345 --> 01:46:44,455
I could feel it from here.

1126
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:46,469
What do you mean?

1127
01:46:47,332 --> 01:46:48,866
You could hear it.

1128
01:46:49,058 --> 01:46:51,264
ls that what you mean?
You could hear it.

1129
01:46:51,456 --> 01:46:53,278
He out of it now, though.

1130
01:46:54,141 --> 01:46:55,867
He the lucky one.

1131
01:46:56,443 --> 01:46:59,991
No matter how it happened,
Del the lucky one.

1132
01:47:06,417 --> 01:47:08,047
Where's Mr. Jingles?

1133
01:47:09,102 --> 01:47:11,500
He run away under that door.

1134
01:47:13,034 --> 01:47:15,048
Don't think he'll be back.

1135
01:47:16,487 --> 01:47:18,884
He felt it too, through me.

1136
01:47:20,515 --> 01:47:22,529
Didn't mean to hurt him none.

1137
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:25,885
All that hurt just spill out.

1138
01:47:32,311 --> 01:47:34,613
Awful tired now, boss.

1139
01:47:36,339 --> 01:47:37,969
Dog-tired.

1140
01:47:43,628 --> 01:47:45,162
Me too, John.

1141
01:47:47,751 --> 01:47:48,902
Me too.

1142
01:48:46,349 --> 01:48:47,979
I hate this.

1143
01:48:48,747 --> 01:48:49,993
I know.

1144
01:49:10,805 --> 01:49:12,435
I am so happy to see you.

1145
01:49:14,257 --> 01:49:15,984
Look at you.

1146
01:49:16,943 --> 01:49:18,861
We missed you at church.

1147
01:49:22,505 --> 01:49:24,807
My hair--

1148
01:49:24,999 --> 01:49:27,780
-You look fine.
-I'm just a mess.

1149
01:49:32,863 --> 01:49:35,069
She's having one of her good days.

1150
01:49:35,644 --> 01:49:37,466
I thank God for that.

1151
01:49:39,864 --> 01:49:41,494
What's a bad day?

1152
01:49:44,755 --> 01:49:46,577
Sometimes she's...

1153
01:49:48,016 --> 01:49:49,262
...she's not herself anymore.

1154
01:49:50,030 --> 01:49:51,372
She swears.

1155
01:49:51,564 --> 01:49:53,003
She swears?

1156
01:49:53,194 --> 01:49:54,729
lt just pops out.

1157
01:49:55,304 --> 01:49:57,894
Most awful language you can imagine.

1158
01:49:58,086 --> 01:50:00,291
She doesn't even know she's doing it.

1159
01:50:01,538 --> 01:50:04,319
I didn't know she'd ever heard
words like that.

1160
01:50:04,511 --> 01:50:07,580
To hear her say them
in her sweet voice....

1161
01:50:11,608 --> 01:50:14,006
I'm glad she's having a good day.

1162
01:50:15,061 --> 01:50:17,362
I'm glad for you and Jan.

1163
01:50:32,803 --> 01:50:33,954
Honey...

1164
01:50:34,433 --> 01:50:36,927
...if you don't tell me
what's on your mind...

1165
01:50:37,502 --> 01:50:40,571
...I'm afraid i'll have to
smother you with a pillow.

1166
01:50:49,107 --> 01:50:51,121
I'm thinking i love you.

1167
01:50:52,943 --> 01:50:56,300
I'm thinking i don't know
what i would do if you were gone.

1168
01:51:02,342 --> 01:51:05,602
I'm also thinking i'm gonna
have the boys over tomorrow.

1169
01:51:09,534 --> 01:51:11,836
Well, you sure do know
how to cook chicken.

1170
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:13,467
Well, thank you.

1171
01:51:13,754 --> 01:51:16,440
This is one delicious treat, ma'am,
before i go to work.

1172
01:51:16,631 --> 01:51:17,974
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

1173
01:51:18,454 --> 01:51:20,563
Brutal, you gonna hog all them taters?

1174
01:51:20,755 --> 01:51:23,249
Yes, i am.
Harry, you want some potatoes?

1175
01:51:23,441 --> 01:51:24,496
Come on, now.

1176
01:51:25,742 --> 01:51:28,428
Soon we'll just see your feet
sticking out of there, Brutus.

1177
01:51:28,619 --> 01:51:30,921
You all saw what he did to the mouse.

1178
01:51:33,606 --> 01:51:35,908
I could've gone the rest of the day
without you bringing that up.

1179
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:37,826
I could've gone
the rest of the year.

1180
01:51:38,210 --> 01:51:40,032
He did the same thing to me.

1181
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,334
He put his hands on me.

1182
01:51:43,101 --> 01:51:45,115
He took my bladder infection away.

1183
01:51:49,814 --> 01:51:50,773
lt's true.

1184
01:51:50,965 --> 01:51:53,171
When he came home that day, he was...

1185
01:51:54,610 --> 01:51:55,952
...all better.

1186
01:51:57,487 --> 01:52:00,268
Now, wait.
You're talking about...

1187
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:01,994
...an authentic healing?

1188
01:52:03,337 --> 01:52:04,679
A praise-Jesus miracle?

1189
01:52:05,351 --> 01:52:06,502
I am.

1190
01:52:08,803 --> 01:52:11,872
Well, if you say it, I accept it.

1191
01:52:12,831 --> 01:52:14,654
What's it got to do with us?

1192
01:52:15,037 --> 01:52:16,476
You're thinking about Melinda.

1193
01:52:16,668 --> 01:52:18,010
Melinda?

1194
01:52:18,586 --> 01:52:19,353
Melinda Moores?

1195
01:52:19,736 --> 01:52:23,285
So, Paul, you really think
you can help her?

1196
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:27,888
lt's not a bladder infection
or even a busted mouse...

1197
01:52:28,943 --> 01:52:31,629
-...but there might be a chance.
-Hold on now.

1198
01:52:31,820 --> 01:52:36,424
You're talking about our jobs.
Sneak a sick woman into a cellblock?

1199
01:52:36,616 --> 01:52:38,726
No, Hal would never stand for that.

1200
01:52:39,013 --> 01:52:41,507
You know him. He wouldn't believe
anything, even if it fell on him.

1201
01:52:41,699 --> 01:52:43,233
So you're talking about...

1202
01:52:43,809 --> 01:52:45,727
...taking John Coffey to her.

1203
01:52:50,522 --> 01:52:53,015
That's more than just our jobs, Paul.

1204
01:52:53,974 --> 01:52:55,413
That's prison time,
we get caught.

1205
01:52:55,605 --> 01:52:58,482
-Dang right it is.
-No, not for you, Dean.

1206
01:52:58,674 --> 01:53:01,647
The way i figure it,
you stay back on the Mile.

1207
01:53:01,934 --> 01:53:03,469
That way, you can deny everything.

1208
01:53:04,236 --> 01:53:05,675
Why do i have to stay behind?

1209
01:53:07,689 --> 01:53:09,607
Our boy's grown up...

1210
01:53:09,799 --> 01:53:11,045
...gone off to school.

1211
01:53:11,237 --> 01:53:13,635
Harry's girls,
they're all married now.

1212
01:53:14,018 --> 01:53:15,265
Brutal's a single man.

1213
01:53:15,457 --> 01:53:18,718
You're the only one here with
two children, another on the way.

1214
01:53:19,005 --> 01:53:21,978
Let's not discuss this as if
we're thinking of doing it.

1215
01:53:24,184 --> 01:53:26,678
Brutal, help me out here.

1216
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:29,747
I'm sure she's a fine woman.

1217
01:53:29,939 --> 01:53:31,377
The finest.

1218
01:53:31,665 --> 01:53:33,679
What is happening to her
is an offense, Brutal...

1219
01:53:33,967 --> 01:53:36,268
...to the eye and the ear
and to the heart.

1220
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:38,186
I have no doubt.

1221
01:53:39,433 --> 01:53:41,447
But we don't know her
like you and Jan do.

1222
01:53:41,639 --> 01:53:44,612
And let's not forget,
John Coffey is a murderer.

1223
01:53:45,667 --> 01:53:47,777
Now, what if he escapes?

1224
01:53:47,969 --> 01:53:51,038
I'd hate to lose my job
or go to prison...

1225
01:53:51,229 --> 01:53:54,394
...but i'd hate worse to have
a dead child on my conscience.

1226
01:53:54,586 --> 01:53:56,312
I don't think that's gonna happen.

1227
01:53:57,943 --> 01:53:59,189
ln fact...

1228
01:54:01,779 --> 01:54:03,505
...I don't think he did it at all.

1229
01:54:06,478 --> 01:54:10,123
I do not see God putting
a gift like that...

1230
01:54:10,314 --> 01:54:12,328
...in the hands of a man
who'd kill a child.

1231
01:54:12,616 --> 01:54:16,836
That's a very tender notion, but
the man is on death row for the crime.

1232
01:54:18,466 --> 01:54:19,521
And plus...

1233
01:54:20,001 --> 01:54:21,727
...he's huge.

1234
01:54:22,111 --> 01:54:26,810
lf he tried to get away, it'd take
a lot of bullets to stop him.

1235
01:54:27,002 --> 01:54:30,838
We'd all have shotguns,
in addition to side arms.

1236
01:54:31,221 --> 01:54:32,468
I'd insist on that.

1237
01:54:33,715 --> 01:54:36,304
lf he tried anything,
anything at all...

1238
01:54:36,976 --> 01:54:38,798
...we'd have to take him down.

1239
01:54:39,373 --> 01:54:40,332
You understand?

1240
01:54:51,745 --> 01:54:52,992
So...

1241
01:54:53,663 --> 01:54:55,485
...tell us what you had in mind.

1242
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:03,445
There it is.

1243
01:55:03,637 --> 01:55:04,980
I see it.

1244
01:55:15,242 --> 01:55:17,160
You think this is enough?

1245
01:55:18,311 --> 01:55:19,845
I don't know.

1246
01:55:55,042 --> 01:55:56,576
You fellas thirsty?

1247
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:58,399
Fresh out of the icebox.

1248
01:55:58,590 --> 01:56:00,221
You bet. That's swell, Brutal.

1249
01:56:00,413 --> 01:56:02,139
-Thanks.
-Oh, yeah.

1250
01:56:02,331 --> 01:56:03,290
Hot in here.

1251
01:56:03,482 --> 01:56:04,441
Boy, howdy.

1252
01:56:04,632 --> 01:56:07,701
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
get some too, ain't l?

1253
01:56:07,893 --> 01:56:11,250
-My ass, you get some too.
-What makes you think you deserve any?

1254
01:56:11,825 --> 01:56:13,839
Because i got a big pecker.

1255
01:56:14,127 --> 01:56:16,716
Well, the day report says
he's been okay.

1256
01:56:17,196 --> 01:56:19,689
Hell, yeah, I been behaved.
Come on, now.

1257
01:56:20,073 --> 01:56:21,416
Don't be stingy hogs.

1258
01:56:24,581 --> 01:56:25,923
Come on.

1259
01:56:26,978 --> 01:56:28,992
Come on now, fellers.

1260
01:56:30,047 --> 01:56:31,198
Come on, boss.

1261
01:56:31,486 --> 01:56:33,212
I been good all day.

1262
01:56:36,281 --> 01:56:37,911
lt's hot in here.

1263
01:56:38,199 --> 01:56:41,556
lt's hot in this cell, and i'm
dogged to drink. I'm thirsty.

1264
01:56:41,747 --> 01:56:43,570
Why don't you give me some?

1265
01:56:49,995 --> 01:56:51,242
Come on.

1266
01:56:56,133 --> 01:56:57,859
You gonna stay behaved?

1267
01:56:58,243 --> 01:56:59,586
Come on, you clunk, give me that.

1268
01:56:59,777 --> 01:57:01,408
You promise me...

1269
01:57:01,791 --> 01:57:03,901
...or i'll drink this myself
right here.

1270
01:57:04,285 --> 01:57:06,683
Come on, now. Don't be that way.

1271
01:57:07,162 --> 01:57:08,601
I'll be good.

1272
01:57:32,481 --> 01:57:33,440
Cup.

1273
01:58:22,159 --> 01:58:24,557
Anybody wants out, now's the time.

1274
01:58:25,324 --> 01:58:27,051
After this, there's no turning back.

1275
01:58:28,489 --> 01:58:29,640
So?

1276
01:58:30,407 --> 01:58:31,558
We gonna do this?

1277
01:58:32,038 --> 01:58:34,915
Sure. That'd be just fine.

1278
01:58:35,106 --> 01:58:37,312
I'd like to take a ride.

1279
01:58:42,299 --> 01:58:44,217
Guess we're all in.

1280
01:58:54,863 --> 01:58:56,110
What is this?

1281
01:58:58,507 --> 01:58:59,370
Payback.

1282
01:58:59,562 --> 01:59:01,097
That's right.

1283
01:59:05,604 --> 01:59:08,385
-No, you let me go! Let go of me!
-Settle down.

1284
01:59:08,577 --> 01:59:09,440
-Let go!
-Settle down.

1285
01:59:09,632 --> 01:59:10,879
What are you doing?

1286
01:59:11,071 --> 01:59:12,030
Settle down.

1287
01:59:19,798 --> 01:59:21,620
"Miss Lotta Leadpipe."

1288
01:59:22,675 --> 01:59:25,744
-What would your mother say?
-You let go of me, you ignoramus.

1289
01:59:26,032 --> 01:59:28,621
I know people. Big people!

1290
01:59:29,005 --> 01:59:31,978
Percy, stick out your arms
like a good lad.

1291
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:34,088
No, I won't do it.
You can't make me.

1292
01:59:34,280 --> 01:59:36,773
You're dead wrong about that, you know.

1293
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:44,445
You gonna put your arms up?

1294
01:59:45,213 --> 01:59:48,282
A big man is ripping your ears off.
I'd do as he says.

1295
01:59:50,296 --> 01:59:51,926
There you go.

1296
01:59:59,790 --> 02:00:01,133
Please, Paul.

1297
02:00:01,325 --> 02:00:04,969
Please don't put me in with Wild Bill.
Please don't.

1298
02:00:06,216 --> 02:00:08,038
You would think that.

1299
02:00:09,572 --> 02:00:11,970
No, no, you can't do this to me.

1300
02:00:12,162 --> 02:00:14,463
You can't do this to me. You can't.

1301
02:00:14,655 --> 02:00:16,957
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

1302
02:00:17,149 --> 02:00:20,218
We can and we are.

1303
02:00:26,643 --> 02:00:31,055
We'll give you a few hours of quiet time
to reflect on what you did to Del.

1304
02:00:31,343 --> 02:00:34,795
And if you get lonely,
just think about Miss Leadpipe.

1305
02:00:43,331 --> 02:00:45,345
All right, let's go over it
one more time.

1306
02:00:45,632 --> 02:00:47,646
What do you say if somebody stops by?

1307
02:00:49,373 --> 02:00:51,099
Coffey got upset after lights out...

1308
02:00:51,387 --> 02:00:54,456
...so we put the coat on him,
locked him in the restraint room.

1309
02:00:54,647 --> 02:00:56,470
They hear kicking,
they'll think it's him.

1310
02:00:56,661 --> 02:00:57,620
What about me?

1311
02:00:57,812 --> 02:01:00,306
You're in Admin pulling Del's file,
going over the witnesses...

1312
02:01:00,594 --> 02:01:03,567
...on account of how big a screw-up
the execution was.

1313
02:01:05,772 --> 02:01:07,403
We going for the ride now?

1314
02:01:07,595 --> 02:01:10,184
That's right. We going for the ride.

1315
02:01:12,198 --> 02:01:13,541
What about us, Dean?

1316
02:01:13,732 --> 02:01:17,473
You, Harry, Percy, all down
in the laundry doing your wash.

1317
02:01:17,665 --> 02:01:20,158
Probably take a few hours
before you're back.

1318
02:01:23,323 --> 02:01:25,433
Where you think you going?

1319
02:01:31,762 --> 02:01:33,009
You a bad man.

1320
02:01:33,201 --> 02:01:35,503
That's right, nigger.
Bad as you'd want.

1321
02:01:42,983 --> 02:01:44,805
What's wrong? What's wrong?

1322
02:01:45,093 --> 02:01:46,436
What's wrong?

1323
02:02:09,357 --> 02:02:12,426
Whole room, whole room's spinning.

1324
02:02:12,618 --> 02:02:14,824
lt's like i'm shitty-ass drunk.

1325
02:02:15,015 --> 02:02:17,317
Had me some shine or...

1326
02:02:17,988 --> 02:02:19,235
...or what?

1327
02:02:21,441 --> 02:02:24,030
Niggers ought to have
their own electric chair.

1328
02:02:24,222 --> 02:02:25,853
White man...

1329
02:02:26,044 --> 02:02:30,456
...ought not to sit in no nigger
electric chair. No, sir.

1330
02:02:37,265 --> 02:02:39,855
He a bad man.

1331
02:02:58,748 --> 02:02:59,803
Look, boss.

1332
02:03:04,118 --> 02:03:06,708
lt's Cassie, the lady
in the rocking chair.

1333
02:03:07,379 --> 02:03:09,105
John, we have to be quiet now.

1334
02:03:09,681 --> 02:03:11,983
You see her? You see the lady?

1335
02:03:12,174 --> 02:03:14,188
Yeah, we see her, John. Come on.

1336
02:03:25,122 --> 02:03:26,944
Let's go. Go, go!

1337
02:03:31,163 --> 02:03:32,314
Now!

1338
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:08,854
All right, big boy.
Let's get moving. Come on.

1339
02:04:42,037 --> 02:04:43,380
Upsy-daisy.

1340
02:04:52,778 --> 02:04:54,888
Do you know where we're taking you?

1341
02:04:58,053 --> 02:04:59,204
Help a lady?

1342
02:05:01,122 --> 02:05:02,560
That's right.

1343
02:05:03,328 --> 02:05:04,479
How do you know?

1344
02:05:06,205 --> 02:05:07,547
Don't know.

1345
02:05:09,370 --> 02:05:13,781
Tell the truth, boss,
I don't know much of anything.

1346
02:05:14,932 --> 02:05:16,179
I never have.

1347
02:05:50,033 --> 02:05:51,951
We can still turn back.

1348
02:05:53,773 --> 02:05:54,828
Boss, look.

1349
02:05:55,212 --> 02:05:56,938
Someone's up.

1350
02:05:58,377 --> 02:06:00,103
This was a mistake.

1351
02:06:00,487 --> 02:06:02,213
Christ, what were we thinking?

1352
02:06:02,405 --> 02:06:05,570
lt's too late now. John, you stay.

1353
02:06:09,885 --> 02:06:12,762
Harry, you keep John here
till we call you.

1354
02:06:22,545 --> 02:06:25,134
Who the hell goes there at 2:30
in the goddamn morning?

1355
02:06:25,326 --> 02:06:27,532
lt's us. lt's Paul and Brutal.

1356
02:06:27,724 --> 02:06:29,066
-lt's us.
-Jesus.

1357
02:06:29,258 --> 02:06:31,368
lt isn't a lockdown, is it?
Or a riot?

1358
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:34,916
No. Hal, for God's sakes,
just take your finger off the trigger.

1359
02:06:35,108 --> 02:06:36,163
Are you hostages?

1360
02:06:37,410 --> 02:06:38,657
Who's out there?

1361
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:40,958
-Who's by that truck?
-Harry, the lights!

1362
02:06:45,178 --> 02:06:47,000
John Coffey.

1363
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:48,439
Halt!

1364
02:06:48,631 --> 02:06:50,837
-Stay where you are!
-Take it easy, now.

1365
02:06:51,220 --> 02:06:53,042
-Don't you move!
-Wait!

1366
02:06:53,234 --> 02:06:54,481
I'm warning you.

1367
02:06:54,673 --> 02:06:56,111
Halt or i'll shoot!

1368
02:06:56,399 --> 02:06:58,221
-I said halt!
-Hal, put the gun down!

1369
02:07:03,688 --> 02:07:06,085
Who are you talking to down there?

1370
02:07:06,373 --> 02:07:07,332
Goddamn it!

1371
02:07:07,524 --> 02:07:11,744
Now, nobody is hurt.
And we are here to help.

1372
02:07:11,936 --> 02:07:15,004
Help what? I don't understand.

1373
02:07:15,196 --> 02:07:17,978
You're just gonna have to trust me.

1374
02:07:33,898 --> 02:07:35,336
What do you want?

1375
02:07:37,830 --> 02:07:39,748
Make them go away!

1376
02:07:40,611 --> 02:07:44,255
I don't want no salesmen...

1377
02:07:44,447 --> 02:07:46,173
...in the middle of the night.

1378
02:07:46,749 --> 02:07:50,297
Tell them to take a flying fuck
at a rolling....

1379
02:07:50,489 --> 02:07:51,832
Just to help.

1380
02:07:52,503 --> 02:07:55,188
Just to help, boss. That's all.

1381
02:07:55,860 --> 02:07:58,929
You can't. No one can.

1382
02:08:09,862 --> 02:08:12,164
-Stay out of here!
-Don't you go in there!

1383
02:08:12,451 --> 02:08:15,232
-Whoever you are, just stay out!
-Don't you do it!

1384
02:08:15,808 --> 02:08:18,301
I'm not dressed for visitors.

1385
02:08:19,932 --> 02:08:22,329
You stop now. You hear me?

1386
02:08:23,001 --> 02:08:25,590
-Paul, I don't want him up there.
-Boss...

1387
02:08:25,878 --> 02:08:27,892
...you just be quiet now.

1388
02:09:13,734 --> 02:09:16,036
lt's all right, Hal. lt's all right.

1389
02:09:16,228 --> 02:09:18,625
Hal, watch. Just watch him.

1390
02:09:24,571 --> 02:09:27,065
Don't come near me, pig-fucker.

1391
02:09:40,396 --> 02:09:42,601
Why do you have so many scars?

1392
02:09:45,287 --> 02:09:47,493
Who hurt you so badly?

1393
02:09:49,027 --> 02:09:51,233
Don't hardly remember, ma'am.

1394
02:09:53,630 --> 02:09:55,357
What's your name?

1395
02:09:55,932 --> 02:09:59,001
John Coffey, ma'am.
Like the drink...

1396
02:09:59,289 --> 02:10:01,590
...only not spelt the same.

1397
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:08,975
Ma'am?

1398
02:10:16,647 --> 02:10:18,566
Yes, John Coffey?

1399
02:10:20,196 --> 02:10:21,730
I see it.

1400
02:10:22,306 --> 02:10:23,457
I see it.

1401
02:10:30,362 --> 02:10:32,855
What's happening?

1402
02:10:34,102 --> 02:10:38,130
You be still now.
You be so quiet and so still.

1403
02:12:01,279 --> 02:12:03,677
Come on, John. Sick it up.

1404
02:12:03,965 --> 02:12:06,074
Come on. Cough it out
like you done before.

1405
02:12:07,609 --> 02:12:11,253
He's choking. Whatever he sucked out
of her, he's choking on it.

1406
02:12:14,322 --> 02:12:16,816
I'll be fine. Just let me be.

1407
02:12:30,051 --> 02:12:31,201
How did i get here?

1408
02:12:35,517 --> 02:12:38,394
We were going to the hospital
in Vicksburg.

1409
02:12:38,682 --> 02:12:39,929
Remember?

1410
02:12:41,175 --> 02:12:42,422
Melly...

1411
02:12:42,902 --> 02:12:44,628
...it doesn't matter.

1412
02:12:45,395 --> 02:12:46,834
lt doesn't matter anymore.

1413
02:12:47,026 --> 02:12:49,519
Did i have the x-ray?

1414
02:12:50,190 --> 02:12:51,629
Did l?

1415
02:12:54,218 --> 02:12:55,369
Yes.

1416
02:12:56,232 --> 02:13:00,069
Yes. lt was clear.
There was no tumor.

1417
02:13:17,044 --> 02:13:18,290
Can you stand up?

1418
02:13:18,482 --> 02:13:20,400
Can you turn around and see this lady?

1419
02:13:32,388 --> 02:13:33,923
What's your name?

1420
02:13:35,170 --> 02:13:37,280
John Coffey, ma'am.

1421
02:13:38,622 --> 02:13:40,253
Like the drink.

1422
02:13:41,595 --> 02:13:43,609
Only not spelt the same.

1423
02:13:43,993 --> 02:13:47,541
No, ma'am, not spelt the same at all.

1424
02:13:52,145 --> 02:13:53,583
No, you can't.

1425
02:14:17,176 --> 02:14:19,190
I dreamed of you.

1426
02:14:21,875 --> 02:14:24,656
I dreamed you were wandering
in the dark.

1427
02:14:26,095 --> 02:14:27,917
And so was l.

1428
02:14:29,739 --> 02:14:31,753
And we found each other.

1429
02:14:32,712 --> 02:14:35,206
We found each other in the dark.

1430
02:14:53,907 --> 02:14:55,538
Take it, John. lt's a present.

1431
02:14:55,921 --> 02:14:57,935
lt's St. Christopher.

1432
02:14:59,182 --> 02:15:01,292
I want you to have it, Mr. Coffey.

1433
02:15:02,059 --> 02:15:04,457
And wear it. He'll keep you safe.

1434
02:15:04,840 --> 02:15:06,279
Please.

1435
02:15:06,663 --> 02:15:08,293
Wear it for me.

1436
02:15:22,199 --> 02:15:23,925
Thank you, ma'am.

1437
02:15:25,939 --> 02:15:27,761
Thank you, John.

1438
02:15:34,091 --> 02:15:38,791
Christ, he goes down, it'll take three
mules and a crane to pick him up again.

1439
02:15:38,982 --> 02:15:42,627
Take it easy, John.
You gotta stay on your feet.

1440
02:15:57,684 --> 02:16:00,561
He'll never sit in Old Sparky.
You know that, don't you?

1441
02:16:00,944 --> 02:16:02,958
He swallowed that stuff for a reason.

1442
02:16:03,822 --> 02:16:05,836
I give him a few days.

1443
02:16:06,123 --> 02:16:09,480
One of us will do a cell check,
and he'll be dead on his bunk.

1444
02:16:09,672 --> 02:16:12,261
Well, if that's his choice,
he's earned it.

1445
02:16:12,453 --> 02:16:14,563
Let's just get him back on the Mile.

1446
02:16:27,894 --> 02:16:30,291
Am i happy to see you.
You were gone so long.

1447
02:16:30,579 --> 02:16:32,497
Wild Bill's making noise
like he's waking up.

1448
02:16:32,785 --> 02:16:33,744
What happened to him?

1449
02:16:34,127 --> 02:16:37,100
He's hurting, Dean. He's hurting bad.

1450
02:16:40,361 --> 02:16:41,896
Okay, John.

1451
02:16:43,622 --> 02:16:47,170
We're gonna set you down
on your bed now. Here we go.

1452
02:17:04,433 --> 02:17:05,488
Well?

1453
02:17:07,310 --> 02:17:09,132
What about Mrs. Moores?

1454
02:17:11,051 --> 02:17:12,969
Was it like the mouse?

1455
02:17:14,215 --> 02:17:15,270
Was it...

1456
02:17:17,188 --> 02:17:20,066
...you know, a miracle?

1457
02:17:22,655 --> 02:17:24,765
Yes, it was.

1458
02:17:25,244 --> 02:17:26,299
Damn!

1459
02:17:41,452 --> 02:17:42,603
Now...

1460
02:17:43,179 --> 02:17:45,768
...I want to talk, not shout.

1461
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:49,125
I take that tape off,
you gonna be calm?

1462
02:17:51,235 --> 02:17:54,303
My mama always said you do it fast,
it won't hurt so much.

1463
02:17:57,852 --> 02:17:59,578
Guess she was wrong.

1464
02:18:02,647 --> 02:18:04,182
Let me out of this nut-coat.

1465
02:18:04,373 --> 02:18:05,620
-ln a minute.
-Now!

1466
02:18:05,908 --> 02:18:07,538
Right now! I want out now!

1467
02:18:11,854 --> 02:18:13,772
Shut up and listen.

1468
02:18:14,539 --> 02:18:18,280
You deserved to be punished for what
you did to Del. Accept it like a man.

1469
02:18:18,951 --> 02:18:21,349
Or else we'll make you sorry
you were ever born.

1470
02:18:21,828 --> 02:18:26,144
We'll tell people how you
sabotaged Del's execution...

1471
02:18:26,336 --> 02:18:30,364
...and pissed yourself like a frightened
little girl. Yes, we will talk.

1472
02:18:31,419 --> 02:18:32,857
But, Percy...

1473
02:18:33,528 --> 02:18:35,446
...you mind me now.

1474
02:18:35,926 --> 02:18:39,762
We'll also see you beaten
within an inch of your life.

1475
02:18:41,201 --> 02:18:42,448
We know people too.

1476
02:18:43,886 --> 02:18:46,092
Are you so foolish,
you don't realize that?

1477
02:18:48,489 --> 02:18:51,463
Let bygones be bygones.

1478
02:18:52,422 --> 02:18:55,011
Nothing's hurt so far but your pride.

1479
02:18:55,395 --> 02:18:59,423
No one ever need know about that,
except the people in this little room.

1480
02:18:59,806 --> 02:19:03,163
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile.

1481
02:19:04,122 --> 02:19:05,465
Always has.

1482
02:19:14,288 --> 02:19:16,685
May i be let out of this coat now?

1483
02:19:35,770 --> 02:19:36,921
My things?

1484
02:19:39,894 --> 02:19:41,812
Think it over, Percy.

1485
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:44,402
I intend to.

1486
02:19:45,265 --> 02:19:48,142
I intend to think it over very hard.

1487
02:19:49,868 --> 02:19:51,307
Starting right now.

1488
02:20:00,897 --> 02:20:04,158
He'll talk. Sooner or later.

1489
02:20:17,968 --> 02:20:20,078
-Hey, let him go!
-John, let go!

1490
02:20:20,270 --> 02:20:21,229
Let go, John!

1491
02:20:21,517 --> 02:20:23,243
John, goddamn it! Let him go!

1492
02:20:23,435 --> 02:20:24,298
Let go, John! No!

1493
02:20:26,120 --> 02:20:27,079
Back off!

1494
02:20:27,846 --> 02:20:29,381
John, stop it!

1495
02:20:30,052 --> 02:20:31,395
Let him go! Back off!

1496
02:20:31,587 --> 02:20:32,546
John, let him go!

1497
02:20:47,891 --> 02:20:49,425
Oh, my God!

1498
02:21:31,048 --> 02:21:33,733
Easy, now. Easy.

1499
02:21:34,884 --> 02:21:36,226
Easy.

1500
02:21:46,392 --> 02:21:47,831
Are you all right?

1501
02:22:19,192 --> 02:22:21,206
Boy, what you looking at?

1502
02:22:28,782 --> 02:22:32,330
What you looking at? You limp noodle.

1503
02:22:32,618 --> 02:22:36,646
You wanna kiss my ass?
You wanna suck my dick?

1504
02:22:57,170 --> 02:22:59,280
Grab the gun! Grab the gun!

1505
02:23:59,124 --> 02:24:01,522
I punished them bad men.

1506
02:24:02,097 --> 02:24:03,727
I punished them both.

1507
02:24:03,919 --> 02:24:05,166
Why?

1508
02:24:06,029 --> 02:24:07,276
Why Wild Bill?

1509
02:24:08,523 --> 02:24:12,647
I saw in his heart
when he grabbed my arm.

1510
02:24:13,510 --> 02:24:15,332
I saw what Wild Billy'd done.

1511
02:24:15,907 --> 02:24:18,209
Saw it plain as day.

1512
02:24:19,264 --> 02:24:22,045
You can't hide what's in your heart.

1513
02:24:22,333 --> 02:24:23,484
What?

1514
02:24:25,210 --> 02:24:26,361
You saw what?

1515
02:24:30,101 --> 02:24:32,115
Take my hand, boss.

1516
02:24:35,088 --> 02:24:36,814
You see for yourself.

1517
02:24:40,363 --> 02:24:41,418
No.

1518
02:24:45,254 --> 02:24:46,597
Please.

1519
02:24:54,653 --> 02:24:56,283
No, no.

1520
02:24:57,146 --> 02:24:58,009
Please.

1521
02:24:58,201 --> 02:25:02,613
I gots to, boss. I gots to
give you a little bit of myself.

1522
02:25:04,339 --> 02:25:05,682
A gift.

1523
02:25:07,024 --> 02:25:11,052
A gift of what's inside of me
so you can see for yourself.

1524
02:26:06,485 --> 02:26:07,828
Suppertime!

1525
02:26:08,211 --> 02:26:09,938
Bring the girls!

1526
02:26:13,294 --> 02:26:16,076
Girls! You heard your mama!

1527
02:26:16,939 --> 02:26:19,528
Yes, Papa! We're coming!

1528
02:26:37,175 --> 02:26:40,531
Come on, Billy.
I worked you enough for one day.

1529
02:26:40,915 --> 02:26:42,545
Come get you some supper.

1530
02:26:45,422 --> 02:26:49,450
God is great, God is good,
and we thank You....

1531
02:27:12,851 --> 02:27:17,358
You love your sister? You make
any noise, you know what happens?

1532
02:27:17,550 --> 02:27:19,564
I'm gonna kill her instead of you.

1533
02:27:19,756 --> 02:27:23,113
You make any noise,
I'm gonna kill her. You understand?

1534
02:27:23,305 --> 02:27:24,935
You understand?

1535
02:27:42,677 --> 02:27:46,513
He killed them with they love,
they love for each other.

1536
02:27:47,664 --> 02:27:49,966
Now you see how it is.

1537
02:27:51,213 --> 02:27:53,994
That's the way it is every day.

1538
02:27:54,186 --> 02:27:58,214
That's the way it is all over the world.

1539
02:28:07,996 --> 02:28:08,955
Percy.

1540
02:28:09,147 --> 02:28:10,394
Percy Wetmore.

1541
02:28:11,257 --> 02:28:12,216
Son?

1542
02:28:15,189 --> 02:28:16,436
Son?

1543
02:28:17,107 --> 02:28:19,888
-Son, can you hear me?
-Speak up if you can hear us.

1544
02:28:20,943 --> 02:28:23,820
I think this boy's cheese
slid off his cracker.

1545
02:28:25,547 --> 02:28:28,328
Percy, i got to ask you
a few questions.

1546
02:28:28,615 --> 02:28:31,684
One minute, he was fine,
and the next, blammo!

1547
02:28:31,972 --> 02:28:34,274
Dirty bastard grabbed him
through the bars.

1548
02:28:34,466 --> 02:28:36,576
Scared the boy so bad, he wet hisself.

1549
02:28:37,822 --> 02:28:40,604
See, we didn't even see it happen.

1550
02:28:44,440 --> 02:28:47,605
I'll cover for you as much as i can...

1551
02:28:47,796 --> 02:28:50,002
...even if it means my job.

1552
02:28:50,673 --> 02:28:52,400
But i have to know...

1553
02:28:52,783 --> 02:28:55,852
...does this have anything to do
with what happened at my house?

1554
02:28:58,634 --> 02:29:00,168
Does it, Paul?

1555
02:29:01,990 --> 02:29:03,141
No.

1556
02:30:27,057 --> 02:30:30,702
Does Hal know?
That Coffey's innocent, I mean.

1557
02:30:31,853 --> 02:30:33,579
Well, can he help?

1558
02:30:34,058 --> 02:30:36,744
Does he have the influence to do
something about this?

1559
02:30:36,936 --> 02:30:38,470
Stop the execution?

1560
02:30:38,662 --> 02:30:39,621
No.

1561
02:30:42,690 --> 02:30:44,128
Then don't tell him.

1562
02:30:44,704 --> 02:30:46,910
lf it can't help, don't tell him.

1563
02:30:47,197 --> 02:30:48,444
Ever.

1564
02:30:50,650 --> 02:30:52,089
I won't.

1565
02:31:03,309 --> 02:31:05,611
There's no way out of this for you,
is there?

1566
02:31:07,050 --> 02:31:08,296
No.

1567
02:31:09,351 --> 02:31:11,749
And i've been thinking about it,
believe me.

1568
02:31:11,941 --> 02:31:15,201
I've been running it through my head
any number of ways.

1569
02:31:17,503 --> 02:31:19,517
I'll tell you the truth, honey.

1570
02:31:20,956 --> 02:31:25,655
I've done some things in my life
that i am not proud of...

1571
02:31:26,230 --> 02:31:30,834
...but this is the first time i've
ever felt real danger of hell.

1572
02:31:31,793 --> 02:31:33,136
Hell?

1573
02:31:38,794 --> 02:31:40,328
Talk to him.

1574
02:31:41,479 --> 02:31:43,206
Talk to John.

1575
02:31:44,932 --> 02:31:46,850
Find out what he wants.

1576
02:32:03,058 --> 02:32:04,305
Hello, boss.

1577
02:32:05,264 --> 02:32:06,510
Hello, John.

1578
02:32:07,853 --> 02:32:10,155
I guess you know we're
coming down to it now.

1579
02:32:10,922 --> 02:32:12,552
Another couple of days.

1580
02:32:25,595 --> 02:32:28,281
ls there anything special
you wanna eat that night?

1581
02:32:28,664 --> 02:32:30,870
We can rustle you up most anything.

1582
02:32:40,748 --> 02:32:45,256
Meat loaf be nice.
Mashed taters, gravy.

1583
02:32:45,448 --> 02:32:46,790
Okra.

1584
02:32:47,845 --> 02:32:50,626
Maybe some of that fine corn bread
your missus make...

1585
02:32:51,394 --> 02:32:53,408
...if she don't mind.

1586
02:32:55,613 --> 02:32:56,956
Now...

1587
02:32:57,436 --> 02:33:02,135
...what about a preacher?
Somebody to say a little prayer with.

1588
02:33:02,327 --> 02:33:04,437
Don't want no preacher.

1589
02:33:05,396 --> 02:33:07,793
You can say a prayer, if you like.

1590
02:33:08,465 --> 02:33:09,520
Me?

1591
02:33:12,397 --> 02:33:15,178
Suppose i could, if it came to that.

1592
02:33:23,042 --> 02:33:25,727
I have to ask you something
very important now.

1593
02:33:27,262 --> 02:33:29,372
I know what you gonna say.

1594
02:33:29,851 --> 02:33:31,290
You don't have to say it.

1595
02:33:31,674 --> 02:33:34,838
No, I do. I do.
I have to say it.

1596
02:33:38,579 --> 02:33:40,880
Tell me what you want me to do.

1597
02:33:41,743 --> 02:33:43,662
You want me to take you out of here?

1598
02:33:44,812 --> 02:33:48,649
Just let you run away?
See how far you could get?

1599
02:33:50,087 --> 02:33:52,677
Why would you do such a foolish thing?

1600
02:33:54,595 --> 02:33:56,609
On the day of my judgment...

1601
02:33:57,376 --> 02:33:59,486
...when I stand before God...

1602
02:33:59,678 --> 02:34:03,322
...and He asks me why did l...

1603
02:34:03,514 --> 02:34:06,103
...did i kill one of His true...

1604
02:34:06,966 --> 02:34:08,405
...miracles...

1605
02:34:09,556 --> 02:34:11,666
...what am i going to say?

1606
02:34:12,529 --> 02:34:14,159
That it was my job?

1607
02:34:16,269 --> 02:34:18,187
lt's my job.

1608
02:34:18,475 --> 02:34:22,886
You tell God the Father
it was a kindness you done.

1609
02:34:25,955 --> 02:34:28,449
I know you're hurting and worrying.

1610
02:34:29,024 --> 02:34:32,573
I can feel it on you.
But you ought to quit on it now.

1611
02:34:33,724 --> 02:34:36,601
I want it to be over and done with.

1612
02:34:37,272 --> 02:34:38,615
I do.

1613
02:34:42,931 --> 02:34:44,849
I'm tired, boss.

1614
02:34:46,191 --> 02:34:50,411
Tired of being on the road,
lonely as a sparrow in the rain.

1615
02:34:51,562 --> 02:34:54,151
I'm tired of never having me
a buddy to be with...

1616
02:34:54,727 --> 02:34:59,138
...to tell me where we's going to,
coming from, or why.

1617
02:34:59,906 --> 02:35:04,029
Mostly, I'm tired of people
being ugly to each other.

1618
02:35:05,084 --> 02:35:08,825
I'm tired of all the pain
I feel and hear in the world...

1619
02:35:09,112 --> 02:35:10,647
...every day.

1620
02:35:11,031 --> 02:35:12,949
There's too much of it.

1621
02:35:13,236 --> 02:35:16,881
lt's like pieces of glass
in my head...

1622
02:35:17,072 --> 02:35:19,278
...all the time.

1623
02:35:20,717 --> 02:35:22,731
Can you understand?

1624
02:35:25,512 --> 02:35:28,389
Yes, John, I think i can.

1625
02:35:30,691 --> 02:35:33,952
Well, there must be something
we can do for you, John.

1626
02:35:35,966 --> 02:35:37,980
There must be something that you want.

1627
02:35:46,995 --> 02:35:51,310
I ain't never seen me a flicker show.

1628
02:35:51,790 --> 02:35:53,804
Heaven

1629
02:35:53,996 --> 02:35:56,106
I'm in heaven

1630
02:35:56,969 --> 02:36:01,572
And my heart beats so
That I can hardly speak

1631
02:36:03,394 --> 02:36:07,998
And I seem to find
The happiness I seek

1632
02:36:09,532 --> 02:36:14,136
When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek

1633
02:37:13,692 --> 02:37:15,994
Why, they's angels.

1634
02:37:16,953 --> 02:37:19,447
Angels, just like up in heaven.

1635
02:38:17,661 --> 02:38:19,579
I'll be all right, fellas.

1636
02:38:20,921 --> 02:38:23,031
This here's the hard part.

1637
02:38:24,374 --> 02:38:25,812
I'll be all right in a while.

1638
02:38:28,498 --> 02:38:31,279
I should have this just for now.

1639
02:38:35,115 --> 02:38:37,417
I'll give it back after.

1640
02:38:40,390 --> 02:38:44,802
You know, i fell asleep this afternoon
and had me a dream.

1641
02:38:45,952 --> 02:38:47,966
l dreamed about Del's mouse.

1642
02:38:49,021 --> 02:38:50,268
Did you, John?

1643
02:38:50,939 --> 02:38:55,255
l dreamed Mr. Jingles got down to
that place Boss Howell talked about.

1644
02:38:55,447 --> 02:38:57,653
That Mouseville place.

1645
02:38:57,845 --> 02:39:00,146
I dreamed there's kids.

1646
02:39:00,626 --> 02:39:03,982
And how they laughed
at his tricks. My!

1647
02:39:06,380 --> 02:39:10,024
I dreamed that those two little
blonde-headed girls was there.

1648
02:39:10,216 --> 02:39:11,942
They's laughing too.

1649
02:39:12,134 --> 02:39:15,011
I put my arms around them
and set them on my knees.

1650
02:39:15,203 --> 02:39:19,039
And they was no blood coming out
of they hair, and they's just fine.

1651
02:39:19,327 --> 02:39:22,492
We all watched Mr. Jingles
roll that spool.

1652
02:39:23,931 --> 02:39:27,287
How we did laugh.
Fit to bust, we was!

1653
02:39:44,742 --> 02:39:48,674
They's lots of folks here
that hate me. Lots!

1654
02:39:50,496 --> 02:39:52,510
I can feel it.

1655
02:39:52,702 --> 02:39:54,332
lt's like bees stinging me.

1656
02:39:54,620 --> 02:39:56,922
Well, feel how we feel, then.

1657
02:39:58,168 --> 02:39:59,319
We don't hate you.

1658
02:40:00,662 --> 02:40:02,196
Can you feel that?

1659
02:40:04,306 --> 02:40:06,416
Kill him twice, you boys!

1660
02:40:07,183 --> 02:40:11,020
You go on and kill that raping
babykiller twice!

1661
02:40:11,211 --> 02:40:12,938
That'd be fine!

1662
02:40:28,954 --> 02:40:31,351
Wipe your face before
you stand up, Dean.

1663
02:40:31,543 --> 02:40:32,790
Yes, sir.

1664
02:40:44,490 --> 02:40:45,545
Roll on one.

1665
02:40:53,218 --> 02:40:56,574
Does it hurt yet? I hope it does.

1666
02:40:57,341 --> 02:40:59,547
I hope it hurts like hell.

1667
02:41:01,465 --> 02:41:03,863
John Coffey, you've been condemned
to die in the electric chair...

1668
02:41:04,151 --> 02:41:05,302
...by a jury of your peers.

1669
02:41:05,589 --> 02:41:08,850
Sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1670
02:41:09,234 --> 02:41:12,398
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1671
02:41:14,029 --> 02:41:16,426
I'm sorry for what i am.

1672
02:41:27,935 --> 02:41:29,661
Please, boss...

1673
02:41:31,004 --> 02:41:33,593
...don't put that thing over my face.

1674
02:41:34,744 --> 02:41:36,950
Don't put me in the dark.

1675
02:41:37,717 --> 02:41:39,923
I's afraid of the dark.

1676
02:41:49,226 --> 02:41:50,856
All right, John.

1677
02:42:10,229 --> 02:42:13,106
Heaven, I'm in heaven

1678
02:42:13,298 --> 02:42:15,983
Heaven, heaven

1679
02:42:16,175 --> 02:42:17,997
I'm in heaven

1680
02:42:18,477 --> 02:42:20,970
Heaven, heaven

1681
02:42:21,258 --> 02:42:22,888
I'm in heaven

1682
02:42:42,932 --> 02:42:44,467
John Coffey...

1683
02:42:45,426 --> 02:42:48,495
...electricity shall pass through
your body until you are dead...

1684
02:42:48,687 --> 02:42:50,701
...in accordance with state law.

1685
02:42:53,002 --> 02:42:56,551
May God have mercy on your soul.

1686
02:43:33,666 --> 02:43:35,584
You have to say it.

1687
02:43:37,118 --> 02:43:39,324
You have to give the order.

1688
02:43:56,683 --> 02:43:58,889
He killed them with they love.

1689
02:43:59,080 --> 02:44:03,684
That's how it is every day
all over the world.

1690
02:44:16,919 --> 02:44:18,261
Roll on two.

1691
02:45:58,673 --> 02:46:01,934
It was the last execution
I ever took part in.

1692
02:46:02,222 --> 02:46:05,770
I just couldn't do it anymore
after that. Brutal either.

1693
02:46:06,921 --> 02:46:11,429
We both transferred out,
took jobs with Boys' Correctional.

1694
02:46:11,620 --> 02:46:13,347
lt was all right.

1695
02:46:13,922 --> 02:46:16,703
"Catch them young" became my motto.

1696
02:46:19,868 --> 02:46:20,923
You don't believe me.

1697
02:46:21,786 --> 02:46:24,184
I don't imagine you'd lie to me, Paul.

1698
02:46:24,951 --> 02:46:27,061
-lt's just that--
-lt's quite a story.

1699
02:46:27,253 --> 02:46:29,363
lt's quite a story.

1700
02:46:29,746 --> 02:46:32,048
One thing i don't understand.

1701
02:46:32,240 --> 02:46:33,966
You said you and Jan...

1702
02:46:34,158 --> 02:46:37,610
...had a grown son in 1 935.

1703
02:46:37,898 --> 02:46:39,337
ls that right?

1704
02:46:39,624 --> 02:46:41,543
The math doesn't work, does it?

1705
02:46:47,009 --> 02:46:49,503
Do you feel up to taking a walk?

1706
02:47:09,259 --> 02:47:10,697
Watch your step.

1707
02:47:11,177 --> 02:47:13,383
Now let your eyes adjust.

1708
02:47:24,795 --> 02:47:25,754
There.

1709
02:47:29,399 --> 02:47:31,029
Wake up, old fella.

1710
02:47:31,317 --> 02:47:32,564
Wake up.

1711
02:47:35,920 --> 02:47:39,661
Paul, it isn't. lt can't be.

1712
02:47:43,689 --> 02:47:44,935
Come over here, boy.

1713
02:47:45,415 --> 02:47:47,717
Come on over here and see this lady.

1714
02:47:50,498 --> 02:47:53,375
That can't be Mr. Jingles.

1715
02:48:15,145 --> 02:48:17,639
Go on, you can do it.

1716
02:48:24,448 --> 02:48:28,764
This isn't exactly the Mouseville
we had in mind, is it?

1717
02:48:29,531 --> 02:48:33,271
But we make do. Don't we, old fella?

1718
02:48:39,505 --> 02:48:42,958
I think Mr. Jingles
happened by accident.

1719
02:48:43,437 --> 02:48:48,040
I think when we electrocuted Del,
and it all went so badly...

1720
02:48:48,232 --> 02:48:50,534
...well, John could feel that,
you know.

1721
02:48:50,726 --> 02:48:53,987
And i think a part of...

1722
02:48:54,274 --> 02:48:56,768
...whatever magic was inside of him...

1723
02:48:57,055 --> 02:49:00,220
...just leapt into my tiny friend here.

1724
02:49:01,371 --> 02:49:03,289
As for me...

1725
02:49:04,440 --> 02:49:06,838
...John had to give me
a part of himself...

1726
02:49:07,125 --> 02:49:09,235
...a gift, the way he saw it...

1727
02:49:09,523 --> 02:49:12,880
...so that i could see for myself
what Wild Bill had done.

1728
02:49:15,181 --> 02:49:17,291
When John did that...

1729
02:49:18,634 --> 02:49:20,936
...when he took my hand...

1730
02:49:21,895 --> 02:49:25,635
...a part of the power
that worked through him...

1731
02:49:26,498 --> 02:49:28,320
...spilled into me.

1732
02:49:28,608 --> 02:49:30,430
He...what?

1733
02:49:30,814 --> 02:49:34,170
He infected you with life?

1734
02:49:35,705 --> 02:49:38,007
lt's as good a word as any.

1735
02:49:39,445 --> 02:49:42,226
He infected us both,
didn't he, Mr. Jingles?

1736
02:49:42,418 --> 02:49:43,761
With life.

1737
02:49:47,693 --> 02:49:50,666
I'm 1 08 years old, Elaine.

1738
02:49:50,858 --> 02:49:55,078
I was 44 the year that John Coffey
walked the Green Mile.

1739
02:49:57,859 --> 02:50:01,503
You mustn't blame John.
He couldn't help what happened.

1740
02:50:01,695 --> 02:50:06,107
He was just a force of nature.

1741
02:50:06,490 --> 02:50:10,518
I've lived to see
some amazing things, Ellie.

1742
02:50:11,573 --> 02:50:14,354
Another century come to pass.

1743
02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:21,260
But i've had to see my friends and
loved ones die off through the years.

1744
02:50:21,643 --> 02:50:23,657
Hal and Melinda...

1745
02:50:24,041 --> 02:50:25,383
...Brutus Howell...

1746
02:50:25,575 --> 02:50:28,165
...my wife, my boy.

1747
02:50:30,946 --> 02:50:32,768
And you, Elaine.

1748
02:50:33,727 --> 02:50:35,453
You'll die too.

1749
02:50:36,892 --> 02:50:41,112
And my curse is knowing
that i'll be there to see it.

1750
02:50:42,550 --> 02:50:44,852
lt's my atonement, you see.

1751
02:50:45,427 --> 02:50:47,058
lt's my punishment...

1752
02:50:47,250 --> 02:50:49,743
...for letting John Coffey
ride the lightning.

1753
02:50:51,374 --> 02:50:54,059
For killing a miracle of God.

1754
02:50:55,497 --> 02:50:58,183
Almighty, everlasting God...

1755
02:50:58,471 --> 02:51:00,772
...the source of all being and life.

1756
02:51:00,964 --> 02:51:05,088
You'll be gone like all the others.
I'll have to stay.

1757
02:51:07,006 --> 02:51:11,034
I'll die eventually.
Of that I'm sure.

1758
02:51:11,801 --> 02:51:15,637
I have no illusions of immortality.

1759
02:51:16,021 --> 02:51:18,323
But I will have wished for death...

1760
02:51:19,090 --> 02:51:21,200
...long before death finds me.

1761
02:51:22,255 --> 02:51:25,899
In truth, I wish for it already.

1762
02:51:37,504 --> 02:51:39,422
Mr. Jingles?

1763
02:51:48,053 --> 02:51:50,067
Where you been?

1764
02:51:50,547 --> 02:51:53,616
Been worried about you, boy.
You hungry?

1765
02:51:54,479 --> 02:51:56,780
Let's see if we can find you
something to eat.

1766
02:51:57,835 --> 02:52:01,480
A few crumbs anyway.
I know you'd like that.

1767
02:52:02,822 --> 02:52:04,069
Look at you.

1768
02:52:05,700 --> 02:52:09,440
I lie in bed most nights
thinking about it.

1769
02:52:09,632 --> 02:52:11,646
And I wait.

1770
02:52:12,509 --> 02:52:15,098
I think about all the people
I've loved...

1771
02:52:15,290 --> 02:52:17,400
...now long gone.

1772
02:52:18,071 --> 02:52:20,469
I think about my beautiful Jan...

1773
02:52:20,661 --> 02:52:23,538
...how I lost her so many years ago.

1774
02:52:24,880 --> 02:52:29,292
And I think about all of us walking
our own Green Mile...

1775
02:52:29,484 --> 02:52:32,073
...each in our own time.

1776
02:52:33,032 --> 02:52:36,101
But one thought
more than any other...

1777
02:52:36,293 --> 02:52:38,882
...keeps me awake most nights:

1778
02:52:39,937 --> 02:52:43,774
If he could make a mouse
live so long...

1779
02:52:44,253 --> 02:52:47,226
...how much longer do I have?

1780
02:52:50,391 --> 02:52:53,076
We each owe a death.

1781
02:52:53,268 --> 02:52:55,666
There are no exceptions.

1782
02:52:56,337 --> 02:52:58,255
But, oh, God...

1783
02:52:59,118 --> 02:53:00,845
...sometimes...

1784
02:53:01,420 --> 02:53:04,873
...the Green Mile seems so long.
