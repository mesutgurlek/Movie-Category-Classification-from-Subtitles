1
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,885
We are identical twins...

2
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,322
but we are poles apart.

3
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:46,005
He lags behind
where as I, zoom ahead.

4
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:55,043
He stammers and...
I pronounce S as F.

5
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:02,714
On his death bed, my father said...
Charlie, always remember...

6
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,314
life is a bitch!

7
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:09,327
And the only way to deal with life,
is to be...

8
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,329
(Scoundrels)

9
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,105
The path we choose doesn't
screw our life...

10
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,476
what screws us is...
the path we leave behind!

11
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,424
There are two ways to
earn a quick buck!

12
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,992
A shortcut...
and a shorter shortcut!

13
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,937
Get him!

14
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:10,446
I took the shortcut...
yet my dreams got screwed.

15
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,382
Big time!

16
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,891
Blue thunder.

17
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,259
My dreams...

18
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,859
My sweet little dreams.

19
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,408
My life...
my whole wide world...

20
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,901
My booking window.

21
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:48,080
In reality...
I'm just a small time gangster.

22
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,281
Our gang fixes derbies.

23
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,763
Come on! Come on!

24
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,727
People bet money on the
favorite horses that win...

25
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,467
...but we bet on losing.

26
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,469
Blue thunder was
favorite in yesterday's derby.

27
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,445
This race was fixed.

28
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,715
I had bet my life time earning,
rupees hundred thousand...

29
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,910
...on that horse.

30
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,048
But the jockey double crossed us.

31
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,855
I had to pay a heavy
price for this shortcut.

32
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,960
Our booking company lots
its reputation and hazard.

33
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,499
The company is run by
three Bengali brothers.

34
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,401
This is Mujeeb and that's Shumon.

35
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,392
Mikhail, the third Bengali brother.

36
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,928
- How're you?
- The same as you!

37
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,133
My buddy, dearer
than my own brother.

38
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:19,769
A kid at heart but...

39
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,041
a maniac in the head.

40
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,052
Indian National Small Arms System.

41
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,379
In short INSAS.

42
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,917
The heroine of the Kargil war...

43
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,383
purely homebred.

44
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,724
A distant cousin of the AK47.

45
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,863
Weight: 6.37 kgs.

46
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,095
Range: 700 meters.

47
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:45,030
Feed: 30 round
- plastic box magazine.

48
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,239
How many can it kill in one round?

49
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,168
Sir, you'll lose count, but
the bullets will carry on.

50
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,774
- Some people change with time...

51
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:59,273
and how the times change for some.

52
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,413
Arsehole...

53
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,016
money can be quite the devil.

54
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,193
You had to pull the reins here.

55
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,870
Double cross Burgess!

56
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,366
Double cross!

57
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,741
- Shumon! - Yes...

58
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,113
The viewfinder is screwed.

59
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,042
Bro says the viewfinder is off mark.

60
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,445
Not possible, sir.

61
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,780
Big brother never lies!

62
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,930
Please don't do this.

63
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,090
Do what?

64
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,096
You screw us all over...

65
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,435
that's cool, huh?

66
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,766
The sky disappeared and...

67
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,902
my balls vanished from my boxers!

68
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,411
- You know how much we lost?

69
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,153
Charlie, they will kill me.

70
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,888
And we will worship you!

71
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,689
Stop crying, you rascal!

72
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,695
Brother says if he
aims at Burgess' head...

73
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:20,061
the bullet will hit
the clock instead.

74
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,930
- Not the clock... the lamp.

75
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,399
The lamp!

76
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,941
- Please forgive me!

77
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,777
I'm the one who is screwed here.

78
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,377
Royally screwed!

79
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:40,182
If I start crying,
you'll drown in my tears.

80
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,054
I want his name!!

81
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,054
Francis!

82
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,763
Franfif?

83
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,237
You're growing senile day by day.

84
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,011
You've absolutely lost it!

85
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,144
What if I were shot?

86
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,355
My cute little darling...

87
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,890
Stop flashing your pearlies!

88
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,825
He almost crapped in his pants!

89
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,227
Even you would've crapped!

90
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,061
Such a coward!

91
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,125
You really thought
he would shoot you?

92
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,734
You are shit scared!

93
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,397
What did you say?

94
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,265
Growing senile day by day?

95
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,042
You're absolutely right!

96
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:46,912
All three are nuts!

97
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,911
Every brother
in the world is crazy.

98
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,015
Just like mine!

99
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:58,724
Here comes the Love Bee

100
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:15,471
Whiplash him, Fatak!!

101
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:22,753
Here comes the Love Bee

102
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,751
Whiplash him, Fatak!!

103
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:32,762
Here he comes- humming

104
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,996
Whiplash him, Fatak!!

105
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,861
Here comes the Love Bee-

106
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,872
Here he comes- humming

107
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,931
Bumbling through the lanes

108
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:48,811
Hasn't found anyone
worth desiring, no, not yet

109
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,975
Whiplash him, Fatak!!

110
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,451
He deals off his friends

111
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,512
Look at the dandy,
the way he struts

112
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,392
He deals off his friends

113
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,122
Look at the dandy,
the way he struts

114
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:07,757
Full of swagger and all

115
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:13,171
Whiplash him, Fatak!!

116
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,897
Hurl him on the ground

117
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,010
Dare you count on him as a friend

118
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:22,004
The rogue aimlessly
tramps the streets

119
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,950
Dare you count on him as a friend

120
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,279
The rogue aimlessly
tramps the streets

121
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,357
This leech will always feed on you

122
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,161
He may go but will return soon

123
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,998
In every defiled droplet of blood

124
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,934
To nibble your life away

125
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,396
Look, look he returns

126
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:52,209
He returns this
illicit child of the night

127
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,772
Whiplash him, Fatak!!

128
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,784
Here comes the Love Bee-

129
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,717
Here he comes- humming

130
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,721
Here comes the Love Bee-

131
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,381
Here he comes- humming

132
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,323
Here comes the Love Bee-

133
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,452
Here he comes- humming

134
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,856
Bumbling through the lanes

135
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,796
Hasn't found anyone
worth desiring, no, not yet

136
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,834
Here comes the Love Bee-

137
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,764
Here he comes- humming

138
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:27,070
This love is not easy

139
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:32,744
The fear of AIDS hovers around

140
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,081
Wear your oars

141
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:48,459
This river is made of fire

142
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,994
Be careful, lest your boat capsizes

143
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,936
Be careful, lest the Love Bee stings

144
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,997
Be careful, lest your boat capsizes

145
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,009
Be careful, lest the Love Bee stings

146
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,334
Jeetu, where's Guddu?

147
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,373
Where's Guddu?

148
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,713
Guddu!

149
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,844
We need to talk...

150
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,346
Listen!

151
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:11,781
Guddu listen to me...

152
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,449
The boat capsized...

153
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,254
Capsized!

154
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,770
- Let's do another test?

155
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,404
This was the third.

156
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,348
When did you go for the other two?

157
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,228
Why didn't you tell me?

158
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,287
- I didn't want to
stress you out... - And now?

159
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,243
Now where's your s... s...

160
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,379
Sincerity?

161
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:17,780
Safety?

162
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,450
- What is it? - Science!

163
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,456
Home science? Huh?

164
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,767
It was right here...

165
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,496
Kama Sutra condoms, a full packet.

166
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,831
Forget about it.

167
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,773
I'm a topper in home science.

168
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,777
- Home science?

169
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,174
What do you mean?

170
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,950
I mean...

171
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,960
there's no danger today.

172
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:06,462
I don't like anything between us.

173
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,266
Nothing!

174
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,268
Glad the damn thing is lost.

175
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,914
Let me take one last look...

176
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,725
- it's got to be here.
- You're such a dork.

177
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:27,850
- Let it be!

178
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,359
Do you know the distance
it creates between us?

179
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,504
You're in New... New...

180
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,801
New Jersey?

181
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,975
- New... - New Zealand?

182
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,806
New Delhi?

183
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,874
New... New...

184
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,949
New Bombay.

185
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:01,818
Not Bombay... Mumbai.

186
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,022
You love Mumbai?

187
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,505
- Yes, doctor. I'll call you later.

188
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:56,472
He says it will be done in a day.

189
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,419
I can be back in four hours...

190
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,748
same day.

191
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,422
Fix an appointment for tomorrow?

192
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,794
- Please say something.
- Do as you like.

193
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,931
I won't be part of this murder.

194
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,066
What do you mean?

195
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,238
Oh my!

196
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:33,976
Got it!

197
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,847
My single piece.

198
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,456
We'll sail through!

199
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,025
I'm ready to be a mother...

200
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,896
But I'm not ready to
become a father!

201
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,495
Please understand, my dear!

202
00:17:56,175 --> 00:18:00,009
We don't have enough
to support each other.

203
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,339
How do we support a child?

204
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,081
Things will fall into place.

205
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,280
This is our destiny.

206
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,746
Our destiny is screwed. Big time!

207
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,422
I can't get married right now.
Period!

208
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,457
Why not?

209
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,263
All yours.

210
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:33,176
My life... my plan... my future...

211
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:43,450
Marriage in 2014...

212
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,451
and honeymoon in 2009!

213
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,184
Bravo Mr Sharma. Bravo!

214
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,853
You wanted it!

215
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,762
And you didn't?

216
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,093
No!

217
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,109
So I must have raped you then!?

218
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,219
And all those promises...

219
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,422
was it the booze?

220
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:30,464
"Baby! It feels as though
I've known you for ages."

221
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,139
Please, listen...

222
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,369
I'll take up a job.

223
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,113
But I still can't
marry you now. I mean...

224
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,118
"I mean... I
mean..." What do you mean?

225
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,851
You don't want an
abortion nor want to marry.

226
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,186
What do you want?

227
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,499
I just want to die.

228
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,900
Fine! Go die!

229
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,403
Please Guddu... please...

230
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,373
I can't see you die.

231
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,073
- I am not committing suicide.

232
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,877
I know but if we
don't get married soon...

233
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,954
you'll be killed for sure.

234
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,089
- Listen... my full name is...

235
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,953
- Sweety Shekhar Bhope.

236
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,990
I'm Sunil "Chopper" Bhope's sister.

237
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,432
Guddu...

238
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:55,316
Bho... Bho...

239
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,112
pe!

240
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,896
Hail Maharashtra!

241
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,366
- We sent someone to check.

242
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,499
She hasn't been to
college for a month.

243
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,369
Uncle...

244
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,371
- Been bunking!

245
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,476
- Who's the boy?
- I want a chocolate!

246
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:28,947
- Some "Guddu".

247
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,222
- Address? - Navi Mumbai

248
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,227
- Uncle, I want a chocolate...
- Shut up!

249
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,287
Miser!

250
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,801
- Get the cars out! - Chief,
listen to me...

251
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,464
We've got that
interview lined up for today.

252
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,235
It's taken us 15
years to clear our name.

253
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:57,847
Today is your interview.
Live on television.

254
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,719
Just relax and...

255
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,717
let me handle this.

256
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:06,782
Trust me on this one.

257
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:11,987
Look at that...

258
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,298
your blood sugar level
is down to 110.

259
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,493
We'll slice the boy and
serve him for dessert.

260
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,209
- Hail Maharashtra!

261
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,081
It's not my fault
that he is my brother!

262
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:57,434
The fault is that you lied to me.

263
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,243
Why?

264
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,381
Don't you trust me?

265
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:21,824
Have some water.

266
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,233
Add some poison as well.

267
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:29,968
Then you will die.

268
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:33,171
At least I'll be out of your way.

269
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,078
That's the point!

270
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:45,422
I'm as good as dead without you!

271
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,159
Then we will float
around as ghosts!

272
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:55,799
And your brother can't stop
ghosts from getting married.

273
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,732
There's a slight problem though.

274
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:05,136
Can ghosts have kids?

275
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,269
Idiot!

276
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,719
So... when do we take the plunge?

277
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:24,920
Today...

278
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,423
now...

279
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,831
Hello... hello...

280
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,903
Can you hear me?

281
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:41,973
Yes, go ahead.

282
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,280
Yes, it's fixed.

283
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,412
Eight o'clock? Hold on...

284
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,180
Is eight o'clock fine?

285
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,158
- For what? - Our wedding...

286
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,486
- Eii... eight... - Yeah...
eight o'clock.

287
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,022
Today?

288
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,190
Nope... in 2014!

289
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,405
Yes... eight o'clock sounds good.

290
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:14,737
When days are dogs...
Life's a bitch!

291
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:18,375
Once there was some
integrity in this business...

292
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,175
but not anymore!

293
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:25,389
And now, my mind is
occupied with just one name...

294
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:27,382
Franfif!

295
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,026
- I found Franfif...

296
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:36,825
Awesome!

297
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,294
He is staying right here.

298
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,771
Room 716.

299
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,971
- He fixing a race right now!

300
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,471
Alright, I'll inform
big bro. Leave right now.

301
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,081
And when I say leave,
you better leave.

302
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,818
- Let's go.

303
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,353
- Come on...

304
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,063
- We leave this way.

305
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,397
But destiny lies that way.

306
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,829
Mr Narang?

307
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,071
Hey... hi...
how are you doing today?

308
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,469
You know actually, we've
just forgotten the keys inside.

309
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:28,972
Do you have a master key on you?

310
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,113
Sir...

311
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:41,249
Please don't kill me.
I've got two little kids and...

312
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,988
I love my wife, Lobo Sir...

313
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:48,227
Lele Sir... please don't kill me.

314
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:52,097
- From today I'm Tashi's pet...

315
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:13,413
- Where are you?
- Where do you think?

316
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,689
Got the guitar?

317
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,932
Come over to the
Madh Island bungalow.

318
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,767
Cool!

319
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,247
Afghanibhai, is Tashi around?

320
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:38,373
- Why?

321
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,247
The airline guys are
offering a deal.

322
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,378
Hold on...

323
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,781
Tashi...

324
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,385
- the flight purser at the
hotel has something to say.

325
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,156
Go on...

326
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,221
Tashi, he wants to say that...

327
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,816
he is now your pet dog.

328
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,689
But I like bitches!

329
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,465
I have far too many dogs.

330
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,467
Shoo away... shoo...

331
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,806
What the hell!!

332
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,838
- Where are the Africans?
- In Goa.

333
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:45,440
Call them.

334
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,716
Tell them the guitar
has been arranged for.

335
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,983
Tell them to get
my twins by tonight.

336
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,758
They will pick you up for
the racecourse tomorrow.

337
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:11,203
The Bengalis are sniffing
you down like rabid dogs.

338
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,875
Anything you need, will
be delivered to your room.

339
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,953
Don't move out!
- Sure.

340
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,952
But I'll need a wakeup call.

341
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,490
I'll be fast sleep,
counting horses instead of sheep.

342
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:59,120
How the times have changed...

343
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,949
- You got your gun on you? - Yes.

344
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:38,019
Go back and give it to him.
- Okay.

345
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:41,856
Why take a chance?

346
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,526
- Meet me in the parking lot.
- Okay.

347
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,035
I want my money back. One lakh.

348
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,208
- He only has pennies.

349
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,507
Look for his ATM card.

350
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,948
You want to become a bookie,
don't you?

351
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,786
- I'll get it done in a jiffy.

352
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,161
Let's just give the gun and leave.

353
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,306
Packing the whole hotel in or what?

354
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,389
Help! Room Service!

355
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,089
This way!

356
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,230
Come along!

357
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:03,865
Shut it!

358
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,880
What was that?

359
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:38,305
Stop the car!
Damn it! Stop the car!

360
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,808
They're getting away!

361
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:49,944
Stop them!

362
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,126
Damn! Cops! We are screwed!

363
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,258
Don't freak out!

364
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:06,029
Steve... pass my shades! My shades!

365
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,164
We'll make it, don't worry.

366
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:18,940
That was close.

367
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,448
- You knew that guy? - Nope!

368
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,448
Then why did you salute him?

369
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,285
Because he saluted me!

370
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,849
Why would a cop salute you?

371
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,207
What!?

372
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,884
Hey junkies... What the hell?

373
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,121
Sir, seems like it was a major deal.

374
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,026
And it went wrong!

375
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,825
On the floor where we
found the dead bodies...

376
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,200
the security cameras were damaged

377
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,766
What are you doing?

378
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,111
- Did you have prior information?

379
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:30,379
We were expecting someone but...

380
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,456
did you check the
other security cameras?

381
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:34,916
- No, it's being done.
- Then do it!

382
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,268
You want to talk?

383
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,204
Okay... move it!

384
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,910
- Where the hell are you?
- Afghanibhai...

385
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,351
There's a problem.
We were leaving the hotel...

386
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:10,087
but got stuck in a
crossfire between two gangs.

387
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:13,056
- You are still in Panvel?
- Yes...

388
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,291
and the DCP is here as well.

389
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,061
It's difficult to leave.

390
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:19,193
Like I care!

391
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,830
We fixed the
delivery as per your time.

392
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,841
- I get it but...

393
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,435
please try and understand.

394
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,340
Try telling this to Tashi.
I'll hand him the phone.

395
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,881
Look, security is tight
and sniffer dogs are around.

396
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,717
What's more important?

397
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,154
Guitar's safety
or scheduled delivery?

398
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,188
Fine! Commit a final time!

399
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,992
Problem, safety and all that.
Tell me!

400
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,892
- Eight... - Eight o'clock.

401
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,292
Tomorrow morning?

402
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,204
Why don't you come over here...

403
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,298
and collect it yourself.

404
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:11,084
OK! But eight means eight, clear?

405
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,315
Loud and clear!

406
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,349
By the way...

407
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,261
- the guitar is safe?
- Should I play a tune?

408
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,126
- See you tomorrow. - Tune?

409
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:44,177
- Where is Sweety?
- Tear this place apart!

410
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:48,816
Tell me or I'll break your head!

411
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,187
He is Charlie's brother.

412
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:58,886
Charlie who?

413
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,090
That gambler from the train yard!

414
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,267
- Chief, there is
good news and bad news.

415
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,974
He seems to be a nice guy.

416
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,810
- Works for an NGO besides...

417
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,077
Bad! Give me the bad!

418
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,117
They genuinely love each other!

419
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,080
They're getting married.

420
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,416
- I could stop it if you say so.

421
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:30,755
But they do look like...

422
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,092
they're made for each other.

423
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,530
I'll get your mom hooked up
with him!

424
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,962
- Get me Sweety on the phone!
- Yes, Chief!

425
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:41,863
- As soon as I get there.

426
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,900
Damn it! What's going on!

427
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:35,000
From the frying pan into the fire...

428
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,307
and back into the frying pan!

429
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:40,869
Forget it.

430
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:44,845
Don't even think about it!

431
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:48,078
Just get away!

432
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,391
Charlie...

433
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,463
The shortcut...

434
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,302
or the shorter fhortcut!

435
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,832
- But...
- But what?

436
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,435
Don't forget!

437
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:19,005
The path you choose
doesn't screw your life...

438
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,145
what screws you is...

439
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:24,886
the one you leave behind!

440
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,075
Greetings, everyone.

441
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,973
Please remain seated.

442
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,011
- Sweety dear...

443
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:01,182
- Where have you been?

444
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,157
Been looking all over for you.

445
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:14,834
Greetings! I am your brother-in-law.

446
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,147
I consider myself an
Indian first and then a Marathi.

447
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:29,819
But what annoys me is
that my house guest...

448
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,278
who shares my food...

449
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,017
shares my wages...

450
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:34,381
drinks my milk...

451
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,291
saves the butter for his own toast.

452
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,124
How is that fair?

453
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,192
- Now even... - Cut!

454
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,264
Brother...

455
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,100
Why are you doing this to me?

456
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:59,809
I wanted to make your
wedding a grand affair.

457
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,419
Why did you hurt me?

458
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:09,688
You wanted me to marry
that builder's son...

459
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,197
And who is this boy?
What is his name?

460
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:16,123
- Tell me...

461
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,392
Sanjay...

462
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:23,871
Sanjay? Give me his full name!

463
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:26,273
Sanjay Kumar Sharma, son
of Kishan Kumar Sharma...

464
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,139
bows to the 25 crore
Gods and Goddesses...

465
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,338
Hang on!!

466
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,346
Come again. What is his name?

467
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:34,942
Sanjay Kumar Sharma.

468
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:36,244
Sanjay Kumar Sharma?

469
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:38,944
- Where are you from?

470
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:41,181
Barabanki.

471
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,926
Barabanki? U.P.

472
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,291
Holy crap!

473
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:50,229
Give me the phone.
Just give the damn phone!

474
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:53,268
Chief... we are screwed!

475
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:57,898
He is a bloody migrant, from U.P.!

476
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:00,999
- We've identified the dead bodies.

477
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:02,803
They belong to the K D Narang gang.

478
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:05,977
But the boy in the camera footage...

479
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,976
- Don't know how he
is connected to this.

480
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,177
Investigations are still on.

481
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:13,847
This way, Sir...

482
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,015
Play it.

483
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:18,920
Rewind... slower...

484
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,298
Get him! Closer.

485
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,015
Beat the crap out of him.

486
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:21,849
Bloody migrant!

487
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:23,351
Let him go...

488
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:26,794
I would've killed you right now...

489
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,167
You sons of bitches!

490
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,203
- Leave him... - Sweety get away!

491
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:38,365
Guddu, get up!

492
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,137
Dare not touch him!

493
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:45,946
Don't you get it?

494
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:51,285
Your chief is ready to
trade his sister for votes.

495
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:54,813
I don't want to marry
that builder's wretched son.

496
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,453
At least you should've
supported me.

497
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,830
- I'll speak to chief...
- Back off!

498
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:04,425
You...

499
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:09,170
Get the car keys. Move it!

500
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,308
To hell with the polictics...

501
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:13,866
that builder's son...

502
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,069
To hell with brother!

503
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,270
I'll talk to him...

504
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,909
Douse the fire!

505
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,081
They're getting away!

506
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:56,301
Awesome! Killer stuff!

507
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:57,971
Where did you get it from?

508
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:00,905
How much do I get?

509
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:02,042
How much do you want?

510
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,045
Ten!

511
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:06,382
You got it!

512
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:09,383
Lakhs!

513
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:13,921
For one packet?

514
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:17,491
A hundred packets!

515
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:27,067
A hundred!

516
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,215
You created a ruckus at
the hotel, didn't you?

517
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:38,020
I told you to leave immediately.

518
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,891
Leaving wouldn't have helped.

519
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:45,818
Opportunity came
knocking and I grabbed it!

520
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,188
Lady luck smiled on me!

521
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:04,070
A hundred packets of...

522
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,240
cocaine!

523
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:08,375
- And they belong to?

524
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,778
Us!

525
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:15,915
What will you do with ten lakhs?

526
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:24,825
I'll become a bookie.

527
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,428
You bloody scoundrel!

528
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:31,398
Open your mouth
- ha ha ha!

529
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,777
No...

530
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,106
- With a hundred
packets we'll make enough...

531
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:41,480
- to own the entire racecourse!

532
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:43,410
And then!

533
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:50,889
Spain... France...
Miami... Copacabana...

534
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:52,223
Psychedelic Trance! Dude!

535
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,188
Come on!

536
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:57,991
Let's rock!

537
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,730
Shake the booty!

538
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:11,576
Come, let's wring our hearts

539
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:14,573
Smash the pot of the night

540
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,982
Come, let's pry out some good luck

541
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:19,521
Let's break into the vault

542
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,467
Tiny sprouts of leafy cress,
and oil from oilman's press

543
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:36,972
Life is nothing but money's play

544
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:46,608
Let's have a face-off
on the roads tonight

545
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:27,112
Step out Life is a one way

546
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,181
All you get is one chance

547
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:31,454
Nothing ahead but thin air

548
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:34,554
And the romance lasts
till the breath does

549
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,812
This is what they say

550
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,447
This is what we hear

551
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:57,450
Whosoever surges ahead

552
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,045
Never does come back

553
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,754
Come, let's wring tomorrow

554
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:05,354
Smash the pot of the night

555
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:08,256
Come, let's pry out some good luck

556
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:11,198
Tonight, let's break into the vault

557
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,226
Tiny sprouts of leafy cress,
and oil from oilman's press

558
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,704
Life is nothing but money's play

559
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:19,469
Let's have a face-off
on the roads tonight

560
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:34,286
Looks like an amateur crook.

561
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:38,749
The revolver, money,
everything is still here.

562
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:42,856
Is anything missing?

563
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,802
This time lets play such a game

564
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,804
That the ocean walks
over the bridge

565
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,665
Then whether you
walk on the bridge or I

566
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,141
The city will stay under our feet

567
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,879
Somewhere the news are grave

568
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:59,210
Somewhere there are just graves

569
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:03,719
Hush! Let's not wake up the dead

570
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:06,651
Come, let's wring our hearts

571
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,585
Smash the pot of the night

572
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:12,359
Come, let's pry out some good luck

573
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,897
Let's break into the vault

574
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,854
Dhan te nan...!

575
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:01,143
I've got the tickets and passports.

576
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,411
Go and freshen up soon!

577
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:11,815
I'll get the first-aid box.
Hurry up!

578
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:18,488
- We will miss the flight!
What is wrong with you?

579
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:42,777
What's wrong?

580
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:51,385
I almost flunked
in the sixth grade.

581
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:55,622
What?

582
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,205
We sat on the same bench.

583
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:10,403
Both of us.

584
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:14,140
Who both?

585
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:18,211
Sabiha and I.

586
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:23,148
Sabiha Laeek Ahmed.

587
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,655
I was in love with her.

588
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,131
She loved hearing s...

589
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,795
stories from me.

590
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,133
Champak, Nandan...

591
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,177
Bela Bahadur... comics.

592
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,111
Then one day I realised...

593
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:52,643
it wasn't the stories she loved.
