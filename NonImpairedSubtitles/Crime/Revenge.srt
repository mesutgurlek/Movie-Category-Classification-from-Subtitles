1
00:00:52,638 --> 00:00:57,738
REVENGE

2
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,923
Sir, we've been skirting Mexican
airspace for the last 10 minutes.

3
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,478
-Hey.
-Yeah?

5
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,564
Ever show you my cabin?

6
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,275
From about 10 feet away
every time we're down here.

7
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,207
Give me the rate points,
you big baby.

8
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,711
Two-four-three degrees,
one minute, 900 miles--

9
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,755
Never mind, never mind. l see it.

10
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,071
Spare me. l had a machaca burrito
for breakfast.

11
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,866
Relax. Relax.
lt's my last flight, man, relax.

12
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,369
Yours, not mine.

13
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,549
l'd prefer a little altitude, sir.

14
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,093
-Altitude?
-Altitude.

15
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,552
You want some altitude?

16
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,263
Altitude!

17
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,265
Okay.

18
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:10,982
Motherfucker!

19
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,954
You're really sick, you know that?

20
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,711
Let's see the presents.

21
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,473
All right, all right, all right.

22
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,225
All right, all right, guys.

23
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,478
This is from the girls
at the Afterburner.

24
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,983
And they promised me--

25
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,110
There's a picture
of what they promised.

26
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,989
Fred.

27
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,289
Look at that.

28
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,668
This is from Tiburon Mendez.

29
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,503
-Who?
-Who?

30
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,173
He supplied the champagne,
assholes.

31
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:19,131
"The navy has had you long enough. now is my turn.

32
00:04:19,206 --> 00:04:21,636
Come down to Mexico, so we can do some real shooting. - Tibey."

33
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,723
They are tennis buddies...

34
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,060
...so if an offer for a friendly game
comes up, hide your wallets.

35
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,523
And this--

36
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,901
This is from all of us.

37
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:40,363
Because we knew you'd be
too cheap to buy one for yourself.

38
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,784
-Yeah.
-That's right.

39
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,093
Well, shit.
Now l guess l'm supposed to--

40
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,387
What? Tell everybody
what l think about them?

41
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,057
Yeah!

42
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,730
You're the best.

43
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,070
lt's been an honor to serve with you.

44
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,076
And to my surprise...

45
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,706
...to my deep surprise,
it's harder to say goodbye...

46
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,125
...than l thought.

47
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,269
Pricks, one and all.

48
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,437
Yeah!

49
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,402
So any idea
of when you're coming back?

50
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,112
Nope.

51
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,824
Hey, nothing's forever, man.

52
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,326
No, l don't guess it is.

53
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,418
Except maybe friendship.

54
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,631
-Watch your step down there.
-Yeah, try not to wreck my place.

55
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,800
Hey, you know me.

56
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,802
Try not to wreck my place.

57
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,974
Madero.

58
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,727
l'll be thinking of you.

59
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,350
-Hi.
-Hello.

60
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,478
l'm a little lost.
l was wondering if....

61
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,022
ls everything all right?

62
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,775
Yes, he just threw a shoe.

63
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,152
Well, maybe you can help me.

64
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,446
l'm trying to find the Mendez place.

65
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,492
-Mr. Cochran?
-Yes.

66
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,996
-Mrs...?
-Mendez. Yes.

67
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,208
l must be warm.

68
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,211
You are.
lt's the first gate on the left.

69
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,339
Thank you.

70
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,575
Small, yeah? But nice.

71
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,963
Good afternoon, Mr. Cochran.

72
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,048
You were expected two days ago.

73
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,968
l'm on vacation. l took my time.

74
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,470
-Your bags?
-They're in the jeep.

75
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,264
Roberto.

76
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,767
No, no, no.

77
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,353
l'm taking a place at the beach,
thank you.

78
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,355
We have prepared
a room for you here.

79
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,649
l like it at the beach.

80
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,568
Who are you?

81
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,154
Roberto, gracias.

82
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,282
l am Cesar.

83
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,750
Kind of a dog-shit shot.

84
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,627
Who are we gonna beat
playing like that?

85
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,718
Cochran. You see what l'm
reduced to? Come on, hey.

86
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,097
lmagine what this has done
to my timing.

87
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,141
Don't. Just don't.

88
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,936
-What?
-Don't sandbag me. All right?

89
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,817
Now me, l'm playing
with a new racket.

90
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,944
All right? So l'll play you even.

91
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,198
-l want the first point each game.
-No.

92
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,408
Come on, l'm old enough
to be your father.

93
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:40,663
l ain't giving you shit. l said
l'd play you even, l play you even.

94
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,166
Damn it, it's good to see you.

95
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,919
l wait around
like a stupid schoolboy.

96
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,338
-Where've you been?
-l stopped off at the cabin.

97
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,215
l wanted to work Rocky a little bit.

98
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,009
Make sure the locals hadn't
carted the place away.

99
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:57,180
l missed you. l worried about you.
You should humor me.

100
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,682
l do.

101
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,519
What does that mean?

102
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,231
lt means l haven't forgotten
whose court l'm on.

103
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,691
And don't forget it.

104
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,694
All right,
we're gonna warm up, huh?

105
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,238
No, no warm up.

106
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,492
-Let's just play.
-How many games you spotting me?

107
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,577
As many as you want.

108
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,963
l learned this from my wife.

109
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,218
The caviar. Not the manners.

110
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,639
l brought you something.

111
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,728
-For me?
-For you.

112
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,321
Oh, it's beautiful.

113
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,537
l love it.

114
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,331
l want my wife to see it.

115
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,835
Oh, she has been told
already, se

116
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,087
Does she know we're eating?

117
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,464
Tell her we're waiting.

118
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,430
She's a wonderful girl.

119
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,725
Sometimes l think
l should have married the mother.

120
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,768
Much more sensible.

121
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,150
l suppose l owe you, huh?

122
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,403
No, no, no.
Now we're even.

123
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,573
-What do you mean?
-The guns. We're even.

124
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,577
-You liked the guns?
-Very much.

125
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,829
This is a good start for us.

126
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,749
Sometime this year
we'll take those guns to ltaly...

127
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,418
...and have them fitted properly.

128
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,922
Oh, shit. All right.

129
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,634
You know, maybe it's better
you're not staying here.

130
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,470
This damned election
has everything upside down.

131
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,557
-You sure?
-Yeah, but we'll find time for fun.

132
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:09,479
You know, l was thinking about
a hunting trip in the morning.

133
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,314
-What?
-What do you think?

134
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,275
Shit, man.
That's why l came down here.

135
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,744
Here.

136
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,581
-Good afternoon. What happened?
-l'm sorry, l'm sorry.

137
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,917
-l got lost.
-Well, didn't you get a map?

138
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,879
l got what you gave me but l can't
follow the instructions. You make this?

139
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,422
Rocky can't read them, so--

140
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,055
-l'm kidding.
-Oh, he's only kidding.

141
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,645
Hey, it's a bitch of a morning.
You want some hot coffee, huh?

142
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,657
Se

143
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,784
-Telephone.
-Who is it?

144
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,245
-Se
-Oh, fuck him.

145
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,080
Tell him l'll call back later.

146
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,709
Oh, son of a bitch.

147
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,254
l have a politician
who's unable to make a decision.

148
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:22,302
-Come on. You're gonna catch cold.
-No, l'm fine.

149
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,432
Only whores smoke in public.

150
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:33,229
Oh, Jay, this is Miryea, my wife.

151
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,690
This is Jay Cochran.

152
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,442
My friend.

153
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,902
Tibey's told me a lot about you.

154
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,156
You probably should hear
my side of the story.

155
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,949
Hi.

156
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,418
What the hell's so funny?

157
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,504
Twenty thousand dollars American.

158
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,381
So much for pedigrees, huh?

159
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,138
l'm sorry, Jay, l-- l have to go.

160
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,223
We're not having dinner tonight?

161
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,727
Oh, of course we are.
Jay, you're gonna join us?

162
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,813
-l don't have to.
-Oh, come on, l want you there.

163
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,775
Please, Mr. Cochran.
Tibey's political friends are boring.

164
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,277
She's right.
But the dinner will be short.

165
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:26,074
And if you don't like anyone,
you just give me the sign and...out.

166
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:32,538
No, no. K.C., Kansas City, Missouri.
There's also Kansas City, Kansas.

167
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,290
We're from Missouri originally.

168
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,084
But we were working Las Vegas...

169
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,586
...and that's where we met
Porfirio and Cisco.

170
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,839
And you know what?
They offered us a job.

171
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,801
You know Cozumel?

172
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,844
l have a place there, me and Diaz.

173
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,556
You want marlin?
A fucking boatload of marlin.

174
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:54,060
Excuse me. Understand we come from
the same streets as your husband.

175
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,978
Or hunting. You prefer hunting?

176
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,147
-l have a place in--
-ln Merida

177
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,149
Merida, anything you want

178
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,401
Hundred ducks, hundred quail.

179
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,987
Anything. Both of you.

180
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,574
l won't shoot a hundred anything.

181
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,286
Oh, that's funny.

182
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,164
Because l thought that you
were from Vietnam.

183
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,041
What happened?
You see no action?

184
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:22,171
Mr. Cochran is a pilot.
He's known all over the world.

185
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,718
You know, the biggest thing
that l ever killed...

186
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,178
...was a jaguar.

187
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,598
He stood 9 feet tall,
including the tail.

188
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,851
You know what l used?

189
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,478
Your car.

190
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,490
That's right.

191
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,244
He was sitting in the roadway.

192
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,746
-Will you please excuse us?
-Yes.

193
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,958
We're gonna discuss
some business.

194
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,673
lbarra.

195
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,552
Yeah.

196
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,742
-Excuse me.
-Maybe.

197
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,081
Mr. Cochran.

198
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,919
l'm sure Tibey
would want you to stay.

199
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:57,433
Patr6n, it has not been easy.

200
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,103
l have worked very hard
with these people.

201
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,814
We are very close.

202
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,108
But there is a problem.

203
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,362
What is that?

204
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,948
Well, things are not
what they used to be.

205
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,076
For instance, 200 million pesos
is not what it used to be.

206
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:19,247
And these people in the union
are smarter than what they used to be.

207
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,334
And there's more of them.
And these people...

208
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,421
...do not respect the name
of Tiburon Mendez.

209
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,132
For them,
it's only a matter of money.

210
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,804
So they took your offer
as an insult.

211
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,058
One more thing.

212
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,728
The American,
though he is your friend...

213
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,064
...he insulted us twice.

214
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,068
That is a separate matter.

215
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,073
Well, how did you meet Tibey?
How did that happen?

216
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,078
Well, l've known Tibey
for as long as l can remember.

217
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,165
He and my father
were in business together.

218
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:07,336
Tibey rescued him from bankruptcy
and they became close friends.

219
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,511
That's how marriages are arranged
down here.

220
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,353
Did l just blow your mind?

221
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,356
-Yes.
-Yes.

222
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,611
-lt's not polite to mimic people.
-Oh, l know.

223
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,280
Well, that's not how it was.

224
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:39,368
l married Tibey
because l was in love with him.

225
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,872
All my sisters
were in love with him.

226
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,173
Well, it's getting late.

227
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,884
Would you tell Tibey
that l was tired?

228
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,470
Yes.

229
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,061
-Thank you for dinner.
-You're welcome.

230
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,201
You are stupid.

231
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,163
But you are more stupid.

232
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,083
While you try to steal my money...

233
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,960
...the union accepts an offer
from Mendoza.

234
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,130
Tomorrow...

235
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,467
...there will be an announcement.

236
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:42,431
lt will be an announcement
of support for Mendoza.

237
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,143
You make a long speech...

238
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,606
...about how things have changed.

239
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,235
You think to lecture me...

240
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,071
...in my own house.

241
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,994
You insult my guest.

242
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,543
Maybe you think you're me.

243
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,713
Let's ask stupid.

244
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,801
Do you think he's me?

245
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,483
Patr6n, if l have offended you--

246
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,779
No, no. Both of you.
But your mistake means nothing.

247
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:43,159
l can always buy support.

248
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,580
But you have no manners.

249
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,207
lt is to you and you...

250
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,961
...that my name means nothing.

251
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,523
You are very smart...

252
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,984
...but not ready to be me.

253
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,571
You want to work for me?

254
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,726
-Hi.
-Hello.

255
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,399
Would you like to come inside
for a few minutes?

256
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,236
Yes. For a while.

257
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,700
l was gonna make some lemonade.
You want some?

258
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,911
Yes, l would.

259
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:14,250
-Do you need any help?
-No, l know how to make lemonade.

260
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,506
l hope we didn't embarrass you
last night.

261
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,716
No, l wasn't embarrassed.

262
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:32,226
lt's kind of strange here.
Are you comfortable?

263
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,894
Yeah, it's nice.

264
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,317
ls something wrong?

265
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,445
No. Everything's fine.

266
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,615
-Are you sure you don't need help?
-No.

267
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,994
No.

268
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,248
Fuck.

269
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,720
l think my dog's escaping.

270
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:01,857
Watch this.

271
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,777
-l hate this part.
-What part?

272
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,488
The "not knowing
if he'll do it" part.

273
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,281
Rock, go!

274
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,039
-You like that one?
-Yeah, it's great.

275
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,916
Come on, Rock.

276
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,210
Come on.

277
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,047
Tibey told me you were married.

278
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,925
l was once. Now l'm divorced.

279
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,719
What happened?

280
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,556
You don't have to answer. Sorry.

281
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:38,394
l guess l was married to jets
as much as l was to her.

282
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,815
lt wasn't a good way to be living.

283
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,069
l think people love each other
the best way they know how.

284
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,072
-You wanna try that trick?
-Sure.

285
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,365
-You sure?
-Yeah.

286
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,203
-You're sure you wanna try this?
-Yes, l'm positive.

287
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,997
What?

288
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,709
What did you say?

289
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,881
l didn't say anything but Rocky thinks
you ought to have a blindfold.

290
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:11,552
Well, Rocky's wrong.
Put it right here. Right here.

291
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,809
Rocky. Rocky, up!

292
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,771
Good boy, Rocky.

293
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,191
Okay, little boy. Yes.

294
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,423
l guess Rocky's got more sense
than both of us.

295
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,230
Thank you. l should go.

296
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,947
l have to go.

297
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,123
Miryea.

298
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,473
Are you looking for someone,
Mr. Cochran?

299
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,725
No. ls someone looking for me?

300
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,645
-No, se
-Let's get it straight.

301
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,856
l don't like you.
You don't like me. Right?

302
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,401
lf l'm looking for someone, it's none
of your business. You understand?

303
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,918
Out. l'm sorry, l saw it out.

304
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,719
All right, it's match point.

305
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,265
Out.

306
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,225
Just out.

307
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,602
-Well, wait.
-No, Jay.

308
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,646
-How far in does it have to be?
-lt was out.

309
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,107
This prick's been cheating
the whole game.

310
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:03,612
-Can't you humor him? l need a favor.
-We'll humor him tonight.

311
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:05,989
What's the difference?

312
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,741
l mean, can't they win?

313
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,994
Not like this. l mean, fuck him.
These guys may be important...

314
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,871
...but they don't mean shit to me.

315
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:17,459
Besides l can't--
l can't afford to lose 500 bucks.

316
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,546
Okay, l'm with you.

317
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,716
All right. Match point.

318
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,661
l got it. l got it.

319
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,914
Oh, no, no.

320
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:00,043
You all right, Nano?
lt was an accident, hombre.

321
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,878
Come on.

322
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,673
Good game, good game. Carlos.

323
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,467
Very fine today, huh?

324
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,141
Tell me.

325
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,310
Why do you want to kill
all my friends?

326
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,568
Maybe l'm feeling
out of my element down here.

327
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,238
Maybe you need some hamburger
and some french fries.

328
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,824
Maybe l do.

329
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:37,247
-Goddamn it.
-What's the matter?

330
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,624
The cold war continues.

331
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,794
Every time we fight,
she plays that Ranchero music...

332
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,047
...which she knows l hate.

333
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:51,178
lt's the music l grew up with.

334
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,849
Let me ask you something.
Do you think my wife is beautiful?

335
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,560
-What?
-Yeah.

336
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,024
What do you want me to say?
Of course.

337
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,906
Because a woman like that...

338
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,535
...you'd do almost anything
to keep her.

339
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,886
-Madero?
-Yeah. Who's this?

340
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,095
lt's Jay.

341
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,722
Shit, man,
where the hell are you?

342
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,391
l'm down here in Mexico.

343
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,019
What's the matter with you?
What happened?

344
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,941
l think l'm fucked.

345
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,984
What's wrong?

346
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,907
l think l fell in love.

347
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,618
You think you fell in love?
You don't do that.

348
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,745
l know.

349
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,956
With who?

350
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,084
Who?

351
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:10,507
-Tibey's wife.
-Tibey's wife?

352
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,592
You fell in love with Tibey's wife?

353
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,012
How could that happen?

354
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,056
l don't know.

355
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:21,351
Now, you listen to me. You get
your ass out of there right now.

356
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,813
You put your shit in the truck,
point towards the border and drive.

357
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,356
Are you listening to me?

358
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:29,484
Here, if you fuck somebody's lady,
work it out in group therapy.

359
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,903
There, that's serious
and they'll shoot you.

360
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,240
Jay? Jay?

361
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,656
l wish l could spend
more than two hours with you.

362
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,206
Well, maybe you can.

363
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:35,258
lsabella, l'm going to ask you
an enormous favor.

364
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,763
Well, you might have to lie.

365
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,894
Well, l've told Tibey l'm going to
visit you in Miami for a few days.

366
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,356
No, no, no.
l'm not really coming.

367
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:53,318
l'm just asking you to pretend
in case he calls.

368
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,533
Jay, may l come in?

369
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,078
Sure.

370
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,580
l'm by myself.

371
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,586
l'm on my way to a meeting.

372
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,798
-l hope you don't mind.
-No, no.

373
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:20,011
-May l have a drink of water?
-Absolutely.

374
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,430
Please, sit.

375
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,307
Thank you.

376
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,939
You going somewhere?

377
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,780
To my cabin.

378
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,617
l've got a better idea.

379
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:47,414
l'm going down to Barranquilla,
then Caracas for a few days.

380
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,958
l would like you to fly me down.

381
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:56,589
Oh, Christ, Tibey. l've only been
off a plane less than a month.

382
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,258
You don't want to fly again?

383
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,889
We had some wonderful times.

384
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:10,186
l wish l could say yes,
but you know...

385
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:13,523
...l got it in my head
about going to the cabin.

386
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,819
As a favor?

387
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,950
l can't, Tibey.

388
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,537
l understand.

389
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:32,375
Even simple pleasures
can become like a drug sometimes.

390
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,504
When do you go
to your cabin, then?

391
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:41,384
-ln the morning.
-We all go in the morning.

392
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,720
l go to Caracas...

393
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,513
...my wife to Miami...

394
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:50,351
...and you, my dear friend,
to Agua Prieta...

395
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,438
...where even a Mexican
feels lonely.

396
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,902
As l promised.

397
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:05,533
Go to ltaly to fit the guns.

398
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,248
Jay?

399
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:17,086
Goodbye.

400
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,205
l'm only going for the weekend.

401
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,708
Second thoughts?

402
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,713
Kiss me.

403
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,258
Kiss me.

404
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,419
-So?
-So?

405
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,463
-So it's great.
-lt's beautiful.

406
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:31,591
-Say "great."
-Great. Great.

407
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,560
l want to sleep right there.

408
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,521
Wait, we're gonna eat.
We're gonna eat here.

409
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,695
We're going to do everything here.

410
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,159
Get out, Rock.

411
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,219
Faithless whore!

412
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:02,890
No.

413
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,235
No!

414
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,602
No!

415
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,981
No!

416
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,459
Get him up.

417
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:18,049
l want you to see
what happens to whores.

418
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,719
Your whore.

419
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,486
You want to fuck?

420
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:43,032
You will be fucked 50 times a day...

421
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:46,494
...before you die.

422
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,752
l warned you!

423
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,580
Ramon.

424
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,568
Don't you think
we should start getting back?

425
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,405
Just a little further.

426
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:21,699
But, compadre...

427
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,868
...you don't become a mountain lion
in just a few days.

428
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,860
All right, try it.

429
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,155
Wait a second. One more time.

430
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,535
Jesus!

431
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,497
Here we go.

432
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:37,042
lt's a miracle man.

433
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:40,587
The miracle is
this piece of shit ran before.

434
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:48,220
La Vieja takes her walk in
the mountains early tonight.

435
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:51,014
l told her you were going.

436
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,517
l think she's angry with me.

437
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,435
Yeah, well, she'll get over it.

438
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,730
Maybe you'll find another gringo
in a ditch, huh?

439
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,286
You know, compadre?

440
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,871
l think it's good
that you are leaving.

441
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,416
You're not a secret anymore.

442
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,835
Does that make trouble for you?

443
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:22,421
Oh, not for me, but now
there are men going around...

444
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:26,466
...asking questions of an American
who may or may not be dead.

445
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:29,177
The border is not that far from here.

446
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,264
l think you'd better go there.

447
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,766
Otherwise...

448
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,519
...you'll never get out of Mexico alive.

449
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:41,481
Thank you,
but there's someone l have to find.

450
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,449
Tiburon Mendez is in Durango.

451
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,618
She might be there.

452
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,113
When does it leave?

453
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:12,864
ln about an hour.

454
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:17,744
We would like to wait for you,
but we gotta go.

455
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:22,916
She's beautiful.

456
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,044
You should have seen her mother.

457
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:32,759
Jay, l got something for you.

458
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:38,223
l made it myself.

459
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,935
Perfect for cutting the balls
off your enemy.

460
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,860
Wait a second, all right?
Just wait a second.

461
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:54,448
-You all right?
-Yeah, l'm all right.

462
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,284
-You sure?
-Yeah.

463
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:00,162
-Here, let me help you.
-Thanks, friend.

464
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:07,335
l'm just not up to my usual self.

465
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:11,965
Mainly because l had to wrestle that
son of a bitch all the way from Texas.

466
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:17,471
Probably gonna have to dope
the peckerhead before l deliver him.

467
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,320
They're no doubt expecting
a calm and reliable stud...

468
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,906
...which he ain't, you know.

469
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:40,410
He ain't such a bad horse.
He just don't like long rides.

470
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,496
Get up in there.

471
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:46,458
Well, when l was a kid,
we had a Belgian stud.

472
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,794
Wouldn't trailer
unless our dog went along.

473
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,254
No kidding?

474
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,341
Them clothes and all,
l took you for a peon.

475
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:58,220
There's a cantina there.
What you say we get a little drink...

476
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,681
-...and some grits, maybe?
-All right.

477
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,016
All right.

478
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:06,228
-You sure you're all right?
-Yeah, yeah. l'm fine.

479
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:16,029
Tell you what. l'm plumb fucking tired
of the horse business.

480
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:21,118
Thirty cents a hauled mile
plus 10 percent on the deal.

481
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:26,373
Montana to Mexico City,
hauling shit for assholes.

482
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,043
What's so funny?

483
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,379
l haven't heard
the sound of home in a while.

484
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:34,798
-Where you headed?
-Durango.

485
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,970
Oh, shit, man.

486
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:44,057
Durango, huh?
Why didn't you say so?

487
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,309
You can ride with me in comfort.

488
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,478
Maybe drive some.

489
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:51,982
You don't wanna ride no bus
down in this country.

490
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,151
You ain't no drug addict, are you?

491
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,863
No.

492
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:08,039
What's the matter? You look like
you've seen a ghost or something.

493
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:18,884
-You ready to go?
-Yeah. Sure.

494
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:26,183
Why don't you go start the car?

495
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:19,361
Fuck you, amigo.

496
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,393
-Go.
-You all right?

497
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:54,854
-Yeah, l'm fine.
-lt looks like l picked me a winner.

498
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,773
This thing go any faster?

499
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:59,025
Well, sure.

500
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:07,200
Sure you don't wanna come, man?

501
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,914
l've got this town wired.

502
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:14,624
You've been driving a while.

503
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,502
A little poontang
might ease your mind a bit.

504
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,673
l killed a man l hated today.

505
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,884
l gotcha.

506
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:27,554
Wouldn't wanna mix your pleasures.

507
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:41,776
Sure you don't wanna come?

508
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:44,070
No, l think l'll walk the horse.

509
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,905
Wish me luck.

510
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:49,868
-Get the door, Romeo.
-All right.

511
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:48,445
Hey.

512
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:52,031
Hey, what are you
sleeping out here for?

513
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:55,034
Jesus Christ.

514
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:57,787
l did it.

515
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:00,165
The fat bitch
damn near killed me.

516
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:03,710
-But l did it.
-Hey.

517
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:05,545
What?

518
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:10,717
She had more moves
than a rubber man from lndia.

519
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,969
You gotta get to a doctor.

520
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,972
-Hear me?
-l don't need no goddamn doctor.

521
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:18,641
-You gotta get a doctor.
-l had enough of that shit.

522
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:22,187
l'd rather drop dead right here.

523
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:26,608
All right. l'll go get your stuff.

524
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:54,761
How do l look, man?

525
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:58,264
Like a survivor, baby.

526
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,266
No shit?

527
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,602
No shit.

528
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,952
What's the deal here?

529
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:22,914
God.

530
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,875
l told him
to bring the money out here.

531
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,337
l usually go in...

532
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:32,090
...but l'm not feeling well.

533
01:07:33,341 --> 01:07:37,053
Tell you the truth, pard,
l think l'm shit-canned.

534
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,556
l can't feel my legs.

535
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,239
A great horse.

536
01:07:57,115 --> 01:07:59,450
l'm sorry you're not feeling well.

537
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:04,789
l suppose we'll be able to get
out of here without being banditoed.

538
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:07,709
l sympathize with your concern.

539
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,086
Look, you just--

540
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:13,298
Just repeat this name to anybody
who might bother you.

541
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:17,844
They'll shit down their pants
and run like rabbits.

542
01:08:18,011 --> 01:08:19,762
Yeah?

543
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,472
Okay.

544
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,504
Hey.

545
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:20,800
Se

546
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:25,304
...l called the baron back.

547
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:29,183
And he's absolutely certain, se

548
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:31,436
lt is Cochran.

549
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:37,942
Perhaps he killed Elefante too.

550
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:46,242
Hard to blame him, really.

551
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:53,624
Shall l have him killed?

552
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:57,837
You don't know where he is.

553
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:00,423
How you gonna kill him?

554
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:05,845
Besides, etiquette demands
that l kill him.

555
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:10,933
Etiquette. l don't even know
what the word means.

556
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:20,610
Hi, l'd like a room.

557
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:25,865
We have a rock-'n'-roll band staying.
All the singles are taken.

558
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:28,367
Look, l'd really like a room.

559
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:31,788
Well, l remember l got one.

560
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:33,998
But it is re-decorated. lt's a double.

561
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:36,959
-Okay, l'll take it.
-Sign, please, and welcome.

562
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,882
l want my goddamn cat, pronto.
Ten times today...

563
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:46,010
...l told the maid, "Close the door
so the cat can't get out."

564
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:48,513
She leaves the door wide open.
The cat got out.

565
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:52,099
You understand?
Will the rest of you please help me?

566
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:53,476
Precious.

567
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:56,020
Oh, honey. Oh, honey.

568
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,980
-Give me the key.
-Oh, l'm so happy.

569
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:02,401
-Thank you, se
-We should thank that nice cowboy.

570
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:03,986
Hello?

571
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,523
Yeah?

572
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,275
Mr. Cochran?

573
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,110
Johnson.

574
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:48,990
lt was foolish
to keep the horse trailer.

575
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:51,659
-What do you want?
-For myself, nothing.

576
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:54,453
Then knock on another door.

577
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:59,458
My name is Amador, Mr. Cochran.
Mauro's a friend of mine.

578
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:03,045
-l don't give a shit who you are.
-He said he gave you a knife, huh?

579
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,316
Did you hope to go unnoticed here?

580
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:26,485
Don't play games with me.
l asked you a question.

581
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:32,033
Well, Mauro says you're looking
for the wife of Tiburon Mendez.

582
01:13:32,283 --> 01:13:34,076
That's a very brave
but foolish gesture.

583
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:35,995
Thanks. What do you know?

584
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:38,623
-Rumors.
-Yeah, like what?

585
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:43,294
Mexican gossip. l'll have
better information for you soon.

586
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:45,087
But she's alive?

587
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,343
Goddamn it, l asked you a question.
ls she alive?

588
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:55,890
Yes, she's alive.

589
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:04,065
Look, l know about you.
l know your story.

590
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,858
-You know my story?
-Yeah.

591
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:08,861
While you're drinking my beer,
why don't you tell me yours?

592
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:15,993
Mauro was married to my sister.

593
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,705
She got caught up...

594
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:23,125
...in some business
involving Tiburon Mendez.

595
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:25,544
And she was killed.

596
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:30,257
lt happened a long time ago.

597
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:37,056
You can't kill a man like Mendez
and get out of here alive.

598
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:40,559
l didn't say l came to kill anybody,
all right?

599
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:42,395
l just want the girl.

600
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:45,690
There's a chance we can get her.
But you gotta listen to me.

601
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:50,027
l'll listen,
but l can't guarantee how long.

602
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:55,408
There's a good chance
some people already know l'm here.

603
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:57,743
Wait for me.
l'll be back later tonight.

604
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:00,746
Go to the bar. There's music,
people there, mix with them.

605
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:03,082
l'll get rid of the trailer.

606
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,090
Don't fuck me up.

607
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:16,429
You gotta learn to relax.

608
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,113
How you doing, cowboy?

609
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,824
l'm not a cowboy.

610
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:40,286
You wanna light my cigarette?

611
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:50,463
Sorry, l'm just trying to make
polite conversation.

612
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:01,891
That low-life was in here last night.
l think l was supposed to fall over.

613
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,771
He's cute but he's an asshole.

614
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,899
-Where you going?
-l'm done.

615
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:13,652
Don't leave me now.
You leave, and l'll make a scene.

616
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:20,701
-You wanna come?
-l knew you were gonna say that.

617
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,998
Fuck you.

618
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:49,688
What?

619
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:05,120
-Amador?
-Cochran.

620
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:12,378
-Who's this?
-He's my cousin, lgnacio.

621
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:14,255
He's a tough one
from the mountains.

622
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:16,257
He's gonna help us out.

623
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:18,384
Let's not talk outside, okay?

624
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:28,060
What's this?

625
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:30,187
This is my friend.
What do you know?

626
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:33,941
She's all right.
What do you know?

627
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:36,151
You're not gonna like it.

628
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:39,238
You know where she's at,
just say it.

629
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:45,578
She's in a whorehouse.

630
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:01,635
Where?

631
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:03,095
l don't know yet.

632
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,389
She's in a whorehouse
and nobody knows where?

633
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:08,684
l'm gonna find out.
You gotta give me some time.

634
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,686
-l know how to find out.
-What?

635
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:14,315
lt means l got my own lead. l saw a
guy in the bar a couple of hours ago.

636
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:17,443
l don't know his face
but l know his boots.

637
01:18:17,902 --> 01:18:21,113
-No. Wait.
-He works for Tibey.

638
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,282
You gotta fucking wait.
lt's a mistake.

639
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:24,783
l'm tired of waiting.

640
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:37,546
Now, listen to me.
We'll handle it.

641
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,214
Where is this guy?

642
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:41,467
l told you, he's in the hotel bar.

643
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:44,470
You can't go in the bar like this.
You can't go in with a gun.

644
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:46,805
Now, tell me what he looks like.

645
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:49,266
All right, all right.
Tell me about the boots.

646
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:53,479
He wears black-and-white
silver-tip boots.

647
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:58,567
He's coming to the show tonight.
l can get him a backstage pass.

648
01:19:00,194 --> 01:19:02,196
Yeah, that would be good.

649
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:48,826
No.

650
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:24,778
What happened?

651
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:27,364
We brought you a present.

652
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:31,827
Senor boots

653
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:41,754
Where is she?

654
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:45,341
He wishes to make love
with your mother.

655
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,092
l know what the fucker said.

656
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:51,597
That's an odd request.

657
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:54,600
So how far is this?
What is this, 20 miles?

658
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:57,603
-lt's about 20 miles, give or take.
-You know the place?

659
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:58,937
Yeah, we know the place.

660
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:01,774
We can get there in an hour?

661
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:04,693
No, no, no. lt's Saturday night, man.
The place is full.

662
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:06,862
-Fuck it, man.
-Forget about it.

663
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:09,531
l'm going there myself.
You don't have to come.

664
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:17,664
You're right. l don't have to come,
but l wanna tell you something.

665
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:22,044
Tiburon Mendez has been hard on a lot
of people and l'll spare you the details.

666
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,757
Goddamn it, Cochran,
will you trust me?

667
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:29,718
Let's do this thing at dawn.

668
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:36,642
What about him?

669
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:41,688
We've known him since we were kids.
lf we let him live, could he forgive us?

670
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:44,858
Walk away.

671
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:11,593
They know me here.

672
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:16,849
Where is she?

673
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:23,814
-Who is this?
-She's the madam.

674
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:29,987
You know where she is.

675
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:32,739
Where is she? You speak English?

676
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:36,076
Tell me, then. Where is she?

677
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:40,581
Maybe a house in Mazatl
where they are rich.

678
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:48,297
And she was very popular.

679
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:02,436
Where?

680
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:15,324
lf she's not where you say...

681
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:18,285
...l'm gonna come back and kill you.

682
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,671
She doesn't know.

683
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:46,521
Stop. Stop.

684
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:50,067
Stop. Stop.

685
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:17,219
Assure Senon Mendez
that he'll be in our prayers.

686
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,179
We'll never forget it, Mary.

687
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:44,621
Qu0 pas6, shit!
lt's the same thing.

688
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:47,541
He hunts in the morning,
he comes back in the afternoon.

689
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:49,876
Nothing's changed.

690
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:51,920
He's not gonna lead us to her.

691
01:24:57,342 --> 01:25:00,679
l ought to just scope the son of a bitch
from right here.

692
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:08,312
l don't give a shit
if he knows who killed him or not.

693
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,649
There's a new man.

694
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,531
Riding with Tibey?

695
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:21,450
His name's Resabio.

696
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:23,785
lt's strange.

697
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:26,330
Mendez must be very scared.

698
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:29,625
-Why?
-Because that fucker is a mad dog.

699
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,501
He can't be controlled.

700
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,717
So, what do you wanna do?

701
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:41,678
Well, this sure as fuck ain't working.

702
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:45,891
Okay, let's go back to the town.
l'll ask a little harder.

703
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:08,997
Ramon...

704
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:11,708
...how long have you been with me?

705
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:13,543
Eleven years, patr6n.

706
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:15,962
Have l treated you well?

707
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:22,260
Then why do you
show me no respect?

708
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:25,138
l do, patron.

709
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:27,391
Pablo says no.

710
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:35,273
You've taken advantage of my wife.

711
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:41,196
Maybe-- Maybe l can understand it.

712
01:26:41,488 --> 01:26:43,907
But then l hear you go around...

713
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:47,619
...bragging that you
are going to kill her.

714
01:26:49,663 --> 01:26:54,793
You've forgotten something
very important.

715
01:26:56,837 --> 01:26:59,214
You've forgotten whose wife she is.

716
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:02,717
No.

717
01:27:53,435 --> 01:27:55,228
lt's bad.

718
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:57,689
She's very sick.

719
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:01,401
Nobody knows where she is
or no one's talking.

720
01:28:06,865 --> 01:28:08,366
lt's time to talk to Tibey.

721
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:11,495
lt's gonna be very dangerous.

722
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:15,165
There's nothing else l can do.
l can't wait anymore.

723
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:19,169
l don't know how to say....

724
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,716
Thank you. l'm in your debt.

725
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:28,220
You're a crazy son of a bitch,
Cochran, but we're with you.

726
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:44,861
Tibey rides this trail
every morning at dawn.

727
01:28:49,282 --> 01:28:51,868
You know, he's gonna think
you're a ghost.

728
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:56,414
Be sure to keep your hands empty
and out where he can see them.

729
01:28:56,873 --> 01:28:58,917
Trust us, okay?

730
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:03,755
l trust you,
but no matter what happens...

731
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:07,759
...you don't kill him, l do.

732
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:09,719
Got it.

733
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:49,986
Where is she?

734
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:06,628
Perhaps we both deserve to die.

735
01:31:09,506 --> 01:31:11,341
Maybe.

736
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:30,318
l ask you now, as a man...

737
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:33,071
...and a former friend...

738
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:36,408
...to ask my forgiveness...

739
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:41,830
...for taking my wife
away from me.

740
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:59,222
l ask your forgiveness...

741
01:32:01,725 --> 01:32:04,352
...for taking your wife
away from you.

742
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:19,659
She's in the convent...

743
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:22,579
...in Morito.

744
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:42,265
Senon,Senon,Senon

745
01:32:58,656 --> 01:33:02,410
-l want to see her.
-She is very sick.

746
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,079
l love you.

747
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:45,930
She wants to go outside.

748
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,530
l love you.
