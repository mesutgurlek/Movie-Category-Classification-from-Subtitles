1
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:13,429
It's been such a long time. It seems
like we've been on this train forever.

2
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:21,203
Hey, how much longer 'til Memphis?

3
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,372
Two more days.

4
00:03:26,718 --> 00:03:29,778
There's a time difference in America.

5
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:19,068
Jun, Memphis!
We're here! We're here!

6
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:51,199
And two days early, too.

7
00:06:24,362 --> 00:06:26,353
Great echo!

8
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:58,151
Wow.

9
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:01,426
It's a lot different
than Yokohama station.

10
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:03,933
I like Yokohama station better.

11
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:05,663
It's modern.

12
00:07:06,004 --> 00:07:07,130
Are you kidding?

13
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:09,366
Memphis station is a lot better.

14
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:11,705
It's antique and has
a nice atmosphere.

15
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:15,404
I like Yokohama station better.

16
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,540
Modern atmosphere.

17
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:21,050
I like it here better.

18
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:42,430
A light!

19
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:56,649
Thanks.

20
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:58,279
You're welcome.

21
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:02,056
Hey, he spoke Japanese!

22
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:06,254
Thank you very much!

23
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:24,471
Sun Studio's at 706 Union Avenue,
but you know...

24
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:31,182
I still would rather
go to Graceland first. Elvis' house...

25
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:33,814
Sun Studio first.

26
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:44,858
They all recorded there...

27
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:47,336
not just Elvis.

28
00:08:48,373 --> 00:08:50,307
Carl Perkins...

29
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:55,201
Yeah, but Elvis is still the King.

30
00:08:56,181 --> 00:09:01,050
OK, OK, Graceland first,
just to get it out of the way.

31
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:05,085
Then we'll go to Graceland first?

32
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,957
Great!

33
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,967
Let's go!

34
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:24,831
Wait.

35
00:09:25,677 --> 00:09:28,339
Maybe we should go
to Sun Studio first.

36
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:31,007
No, Graceland.

37
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:22,656
Look! Sun Studio!

38
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:27,261
I thought we were
going to Graceland.

39
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:29,397
Yeah, so did I.

40
00:12:07,872 --> 00:12:10,340
She talks so fast!

41
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:12,467
I'm all worn out...

42
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:15,444
Not Graceland right now.
Is that OK?

43
00:12:15,513 --> 00:12:18,505
Yeah, it's OK with me.

44
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:22,986
But I was sort of looking
forward to going to Graceland.

45
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:26,581
Really? I thought you
didn't want to go.

46
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:30,384
Let's just walk around.

47
00:12:32,063 --> 00:12:33,394
OK.

48
00:12:57,755 --> 00:13:00,280
Hey, my turn in front.

49
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:02,607
Elvis Presley, the King.

50
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,843
Carl Perkins was better.

51
00:15:53,397 --> 00:15:56,992
You know, Memphis does
look like Yokohama.

52
00:15:57,068 --> 00:15:59,662
Just more space.

53
00:16:00,738 --> 00:16:04,697
If you took away sixty percent
of the buildings in Yokohama...

54
00:16:04,775 --> 00:16:06,675
it would look like this.

55
00:16:06,744 --> 00:16:09,975
This doesn't look
anything like Yokohama!

56
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:13,778
This is America,
and the city of Elvis.

57
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:17,014
We didn't have Elvis in Japan.

58
00:16:17,088 --> 00:16:19,488
This is nothing like Japan.

59
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,807
Look, a hotel!

60
00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:28,148
Looks like a fun one!

61
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:31,020
Should we stay there?

62
00:18:32,623 --> 00:18:33,954
What'd he say?

63
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:36,721
I'm not exactly sure.

64
00:18:55,746 --> 00:18:58,078
I think it's twenty-two dollars.

65
00:18:58,149 --> 00:18:59,480
OK.

66
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:10,316
There he is again!

67
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:16,458
Yeah, and no Carl Perkins.

68
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,752
No TV.

69
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:53,960
No TV.

70
00:22:22,753 --> 00:22:24,118
Watch it!

71
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:31,221
Jun, why do you only take
pictures of the rooms we stay in...

72
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:34,423
and never what we see
outside, while we travel?

73
00:22:39,036 --> 00:22:41,561
Those other things are in my memory.

74
00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:45,769
The hotel rooms and the airports
are the things I'll forget.

75
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:49,044
Yeah, I guess so...

76
00:23:04,028 --> 00:23:07,156
Oh, did I show you my
important discoveries?

77
00:23:14,538 --> 00:23:16,199
Look at him.

78
00:23:19,777 --> 00:23:22,371
Study his face carefully.

79
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,111
Now, look at this.

80
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:33,118
This guy was an ancient Middle Eastern
King. Looks just like him, right?

81
00:23:36,627 --> 00:23:38,720
Elvis as the Buddha.

82
00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:52,200
The Statue of Liberty in
New York. She's Elvis too!

83
00:23:52,276 --> 00:23:53,800
See?

84
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:07,454
Elvis was even more
influential than I thought.

85
00:24:07,524 --> 00:24:09,014
That's right!

86
00:24:11,795 --> 00:24:13,285
There's one more!

87
00:24:13,797 --> 00:24:15,287
Here...

88
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:17,060
look...

89
00:24:17,134 --> 00:24:20,763
Madonna looks like Elvis, too.

90
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:24,940
Oh no, not Madonna!

91
00:24:25,142 --> 00:24:27,201
Give me a break!

92
00:25:26,937 --> 00:25:32,136
Why do you always have
such a sad face? Are you unhappy?

93
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:34,439
I'm very happy.

94
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:36,638
That's just the way my face is.

95
00:26:07,978 --> 00:26:11,106
Can't I do anything
to cheer you up?

96
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:52,222
Now you look a little happier.

97
00:26:59,763 --> 00:27:01,094
Wait!

98
00:27:01,165 --> 00:27:03,326
Let me light it for you.

99
00:27:15,846 --> 00:27:17,313
Thanks.

100
00:27:23,086 --> 00:27:26,453
So, now do you feel
a little happier?

101
00:27:26,523 --> 00:27:28,491
I feel the same.

102
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,119
I was already happy.

103
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,611
Don't you think you wear
too much lipstick?

104
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:00,811
What are you looking at?

105
00:29:04,121 --> 00:29:05,588
Memphis.

106
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:11,289
Is it like Yokohama with
sixty percent of the buildings gone?

107
00:29:11,361 --> 00:29:13,352
No, nothing like that.

108
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:18,463
This isn't Yokohama.

109
00:29:30,147 --> 00:29:32,513
This is America.

110
00:29:36,553 --> 00:29:38,851
What are you thinking about?

111
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:44,016
To be eighteen...

112
00:29:46,863 --> 00:29:48,728
feels cool...

113
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:53,762
and so far from Yokohama...

114
00:29:56,106 --> 00:29:58,904
It feels cool to be in Memphis.

115
00:30:32,242 --> 00:30:34,676
Nothing on now.

116
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,151
Mitzuko?

117
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,694
Do women...

118
00:32:34,264 --> 00:32:37,324
always worry about their hairstyle?

119
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,004
What are you talking about?

120
00:32:42,072 --> 00:32:44,063
In all the times we've made love...

121
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,007
and this is number eleven, I've never
once thought about my hairstyle.

122
00:32:47,077 --> 00:32:48,339
Eleven?

123
00:32:49,846 --> 00:32:51,973
And if that's what you're thinking...

124
00:32:52,048 --> 00:32:54,380
try shaving first next time...

125
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:56,442
It hurts my face.

126
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,647
But I just shaved two days ago.

127
00:34:15,031 --> 00:34:17,022
Jun?

128
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:26,939
Hold me.

129
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:23,481
Mitzuko.

130
00:36:25,128 --> 00:36:27,926
Wake up. It's morning.

131
00:36:32,168 --> 00:36:33,999
The hotel is on fire.

132
00:36:40,443 --> 00:36:42,673
Don't you want to go to Graceland...

133
00:36:44,748 --> 00:36:47,046
home of Elvis Presley?

134
00:36:51,888 --> 00:36:53,879
Let me sleep.

135
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:57,922
It's my favorite thing...

136
00:36:57,994 --> 00:36:59,757
to sleep.

137
00:37:02,732 --> 00:37:05,132
You sleep too much.

138
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:08,864
You spend half your life
in your dreams.

139
00:37:10,273 --> 00:37:12,207
Yeah...

140
00:37:13,176 --> 00:37:15,838
but sleep is wonderful.

141
00:37:17,113 --> 00:37:21,880
And when you're dead,
you don't get to sleep ever again...

142
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:25,710
which means no more dreams...

143
00:37:39,135 --> 00:37:41,296
Don't forget these.

144
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:42,633
Those?

145
00:37:42,705 --> 00:37:44,366
But they belong to the hotel!

146
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,432
In America towels are included
in the price of the room.

147
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,501
Everyone knows that.

148
00:37:51,414 --> 00:37:53,473
Well, they won't really fit in here.

149
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:57,311
That's because you have a
hundred tee-shirts in there.

150
00:37:57,387 --> 00:37:59,355
I only brought two shirts.

151
00:37:59,422 --> 00:38:00,980
Get rid of some tee-shirts.

152
00:38:01,057 --> 00:38:03,184
No way!
They're part of my collection.

153
00:38:03,259 --> 00:38:05,022
We're not getting rid of any of these.

154
00:38:05,094 --> 00:38:07,654
Never, never, never-- Never!

155
00:38:12,068 --> 00:38:13,899
Okay, then.

156
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,904
Go ahead.

157
00:38:15,972 --> 00:38:18,031
But not both of them.

158
00:38:24,147 --> 00:38:26,206
Pack the one I used.

159
00:38:26,282 --> 00:38:27,943
The one I used is drier.

160
00:38:28,017 --> 00:38:30,611
Yeah, but mine's cleaner.

161
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:32,552
You didn't take a bath.

162
00:38:49,339 --> 00:38:51,273
Pack it neatly.

163
00:39:30,346 --> 00:39:32,041
Was that a gun?

164
00:39:33,483 --> 00:39:35,280
Probably.

165
00:39:35,351 --> 00:39:37,148
This is America.

166
00:39:57,073 --> 00:39:58,973
That's everything, isn't it?

167
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:01,033
Did we forget anything?

168
00:41:26,095 --> 00:41:27,960
Hello.

169
00:41:28,031 --> 00:41:29,555
It's me!

170
00:41:31,701 --> 00:41:33,191
In Memphis.

171
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,960
Memphis!

172
00:41:38,908 --> 00:41:42,435
In the south of
the United States, in Tennessee.

173
00:41:45,314 --> 00:41:49,512
We had a little trouble, some
stupid thing with the airplane, yeah.

174
00:41:49,585 --> 00:41:51,280
Yeah, a little problem.

175
00:41:52,055 --> 00:41:54,148
Don't worry.

176
00:41:57,894 --> 00:42:00,761
Tomorrow we've got
a connecting flight...

177
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:05,290
and we arrive in Rome
the day after tomorrow.

178
00:42:08,504 --> 00:42:09,994
I don't know.

179
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:15,176
How should I know
where I'll stay tonight?

180
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,343
I'm okay...

181
00:42:19,415 --> 00:42:21,406
that's just the way life is.

182
01:43:20,682 --> 01:43:21,944
Wow...

183
01:43:22,017 --> 01:43:23,848
We saw Graceland this morning...

184
01:43:23,919 --> 01:43:28,219
and by tonight we'll have seen
Fats Domino's house in New Orleans!
