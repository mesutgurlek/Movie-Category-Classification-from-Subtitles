1
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,196
No more.

2
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,672
- Is that supposed to scare me?
- Don't be a wise-ass.

3
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,715
Just take it easy. Commander Farrell
is trying to lay it out for us.

4
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,831
Why don't you just knock it off?

5
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,916
How did you actually meet
the secretary of defense?

6
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,710
I was introduced to him by Pritchard.
I met him when I was in college.

7
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,071
- Pritchard?
- Yeah, Scott Pritchard. Jesus.

8
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,309
General counsel for the secretary of
defense. Got it? You know this already.

9
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,555
When's he gonna come out
from behind here?

10
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,156
Good evening, sir.

11
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,878
Lucky it's not a bullshit detector,
else none of us would get in.

12
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,550
- How are you, Scott?
- Tom. How are you?

13
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,671
- Fine.
- You look great.

14
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,634
Thank you for the invitation. I'm not
used to hanging out in places like this.

15
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,878
But I suspect you'd like to.
I take it you'd like to join our staff.

16
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,639
That was the purpose of
the note, wasn't it?

17
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,959
It wasn't a note. It was a Christmas card,
and the message was Merry Christmas.

18
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,230
David, Scott is here.

19
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,598
Come on.
I want to introduce you to someone.

20
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,919
- Scott, how nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

21
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,033
- Scott.
- Hello.

22
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,436
Secretary Brice, Commander Farrell -
the officer I mentioned.

23
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,711
He's had eXperience on the joint staff
and naval intelligence.

24
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,833
Everyone I know is looking forward
to serving under you for another term.

25
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,190
You must have
a limited acquaintanceship.

26
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,232
- Tom and I were at college together.
- Good.

27
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,916
He has great warmth!

28
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,516
- He's a genius.
- Oh?

29
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,200
The normal rules don't apply.

30
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,472
You know, some people think
you're really the brains.

31
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,556
Do they?

32
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,109
Is that supposed to flatter me? He's the
most eXtraordinary person I've ever met.

33
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,674
If it came to it,
I'd lay down my life for him.

34
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,756
Is that a job requirement?

35
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,190
Ladies and gentlemen,
it was fantastic having the President here.

36
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,471
I'm sure you'll agree
we can look forward to a fine four years.

37
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,876
So let's keep our inaugural hair down
with some more music.

38
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,956
Let's do it right now.

39
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,388
EXcuse me, do you have a light?

40
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,995
If you wanna look down my dress,
you should grow a few inches.

41
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,239
- Wanna dance?
- The twist?

42
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,112
No, thank you.

43
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,789
- Well, we don't have to twist.
- "No" meant "no".

44
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,480
- "No" wasn't a figure of speech?
- No.

45
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,633
- You're pretty impressed with me.
- No.

46
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,356
Yes, you are.

47
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,436
Stoli, straight up.

48
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,590
So I was impressed.

49
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,676
- Want a drink?
- Same.

50
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,756
Make it two.

51
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,236
Are you one of them?

52
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,432
- One of who?
- These hypocrites, all fat and shiny,

53
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,473
gearing up for another four years of
ramming it to the rest of us. One of them.

54
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,828
No.

55
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,916
I'll bet you are.

56
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,679
- You're pretty cynical.
- Adequate to the occasion.

57
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,751
We have a potential
nausea situation building here.

58
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,359
Let's get outta here.

59
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,878
My date's not gonna like that much.

60
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,116
But what the hell?

61
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,196
His wife'll be delighted.

62
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,434
Is this something we should talk about?

63
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,236
Nope.

64
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,110
- Where would you like to go?
- Show us the monuments.

65
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,029
- What's your name?
- Bill.

66
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,358
How you doin', Bill?
You wanna shut the slide?

67
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,270
- Sure.
- Sorry, Bill.

68
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,796
My name's Tom.

69
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,071
I'm Susan.

70
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,436
We're here.

71
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,914
- Is this your apartment?
- No. I have a key to my apartment.

72
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,634
- It better be good.
- We need your bed.

73
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,309
Nina, Tom. Tom, Nina.
There's a limousine downstairs, OK?

74
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,352
There's booze,
the refrigerator's full of food...

75
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,119
Susan, why don't you go
to your own place?

76
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,676
Because it's... just one of those things.
Be a friend.

77
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,318
If anybody calls, then just tell them that I
died or that I'm asleep or... He won't call.

78
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,874
- I'll think of something.
- Here are the keys.

79
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,470
- I gotta change into some clothes.
- Everything you need is in the car.

80
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,037
- You didn't do it?!
- You'd better beat it before I get arrested.

81
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,037
- Bye, Nina.
- Nice meeting you, Tom.

82
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,638
Nice to meet you, Nina.

83
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,716
Move it.

84
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,390
- Get outta here.
- OK, asshole.

85
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,876
Hey, come on, folks. Break it up.
I gotta make a living.

86
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,994
Move it along. "The white zone is for
loading and unloading only. No parking."

87
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,669
Take care of yourself.

88
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,917
Send postcards from eXotic ports of call.

89
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,316
That's what you call 'em, isn't it?
EXotic ports of call?

90
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,396
A port's a port.

91
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,076
You're eXotic.

92
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,796
Bye.

93
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,278
Morning, Tommy.
A little bit early to be relieving me.

94
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,755
Well, I felt our motion change.

95
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,232
- Have you set a forward lookout in this?
- Yeah. Standing orders.

96
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,478
You should inform the captain
we're shipping water.

97
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,875
Right! You wanna be the one
to wake him up?

98
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,949
We got a Russian sub out there. We're
supposed to catch up and stay with it.

99
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,798
Great.

100
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,590
- A chance to try out the depth charges.
- That'll be the day.

101
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,676
Uh-huh. The last one.

102
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,635
Forward watch is down, sir.
He's gonna be swept over, sir!

103
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,190
- Put the spot on him.
- Where is he?

104
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,276
There he is. There. Hold on!

105
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,156
Has he got a safety line on?

106
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,913
Tommy! Sound "Away rescue party" now!

107
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,471
Help!

108
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,717
Send the special rescue detail.
Forward lookout down.

109
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,594
- Tommy, wait for the rescue party!
- Send the special rescue detail.

110
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,836
Forward lookout down.

111
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,916
Help me!

112
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,510
Tommy, you don't have a safety line on.

113
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,118
- Keep the light on him.
- I'm trying, sir.

114
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,356
Tommy!

115
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,517
- Keep the light on him.
- It's too windy, sir.

116
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,519
Hold on! Don't let him
out of your sight. Jesus.

117
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,396
Help me.

118
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,831
All right.

119
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,750
He's got him. He's got him!

120
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,272
- You've seen the leak on the budget cuts.
- I've read the papers. You're late.

121
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,870
- I was caught in traffic.
- You should allow for that. I do.

122
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,390
I've red-lined the relevant sections.
My synopsis is at the end.

123
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,640
Order breakfast - most important meal of
the day. You should take care of yourself.

124
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,960
Five years, two billion dollars, and Gulf
Maritime can't even float the prototype.

125
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,153
The Phantom sub is a sinkhole.
I'm not puttin' another dime into it.

126
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,319
You're right, of course, but what about
the armed services committee? Duvall?

127
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,752
One thing I'm looking forward to
is putting that fraud Duvall in his place.

128
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,117
- He's right back there.
- I know.

129
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,196
Let's go.

130
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,955
- Mr Secretary Brice. Good morning, sir.
- Senator, how are you?

131
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,038
- Mr Marshall.
- We've been having a little discussion

132
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,152
about that piece on the budget.
Did you read it, sir?

133
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,795
- I haven't read the papers. Scott told me.
- Ah, Mr Pritchard.

134
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,551
Where in heaven's name
do they get their information?

135
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,672
And that idea about cutting back
on the Phantom sub.

136
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,792
It's groundless.
We were just going over our options.

137
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,716
Mr Marshall tells me those Soviets
are doing things with submarines

138
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,149
that'll turn your hair white.

139
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,158
I have no intention of
making a decision on this

140
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,068
without consulting you first. Good day.

141
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,156
Good day, Senator.

142
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,711
You believe that?

143
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,955
No.

144
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,356
The car, please.

145
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,833
That business with Marshall... If we fight
him, he'll have the CIA on his side.

146
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,191
Of course. He pushed Marshall
for the directorship.

147
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,915
- Sorry. I was short with you. I apologise.
- That's not necessary.

148
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,999
Several months ago you introduced me
to a friend of yours, an officer...

149
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,075
Farrell.

150
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,318
- He has a background in intelligence?
- Two tours with naval intelligence.

151
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,000
We could use a hero.
Get him here, will you?

152
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,597
- His ship's in Manila.
- Just do it, please.

153
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,872
No, no, no.

154
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,231
Come here. You want a real hero. See?

155
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,033
Come on. You know you want to do it.

156
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,153
- Gates, you're an officer.
- You're making it hard on me.

157
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,353
- You're making it hard on me.
- You know what I'm talking about, man.

158
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,914
- You deserve the damn medal.
- I carry?

159
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,919
If you jump me for promotion,
I'll kill you, your family, your pig...

160
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,678
- I carry.
- You carry me?

161
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,234
- No, the bag.
- I speak Filipino. Beat it, kid.

162
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,158
- He's gotta make a living. Don't run.
- He's gonna run.

163
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,714
If you run,
I knock dog doo-doo out of you.

164
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,796
He's running!

165
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,596
John, forget it.

166
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,793
No, let him go, let him go. So what?

167
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,673
He's got a toothbrush
and a pair of skivvies. So what?

168
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,756
OK. So what do we do now?

169
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,116
I don't know.
I thought I'd go buy some ashtrays

170
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,959
and take in some of
the local folk dancing.

171
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,832
- Folk dancing.
- Yeah.

172
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,276
You know, when you only pay
if you talk to the person.

173
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,834
Shut up. No, not you.

174
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,992
No, I will pay,
but first I have to know if she's there.

175
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,156
If I'm going to count out a million pesos,
I need to know if she's there. Yes.

176
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,508
Hey, that's my money.
That's my money. Go get it.

177
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,757
No, I'm not joking. I'm an American.

178
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,995
Hello.

179
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,033
Yes, I'll take it.
I'm putting my money in now.

180
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,914
Susan?

181
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,632
Shut up. Was I just disconnected?

182
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,113
I'm gonna show them...

183
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,711
I'm gonna show them how an American
plants the flag in a foreign fucking land.

184
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,513
Can I get a beer, please?
I'd like another beer.

185
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,074
Wild thing!

186
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,196
You're beautiful.

187
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,676
- Hey, thanks.
- Keep it. Thank you.

188
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,033
Hello, Tom. Welcome back.
I've some mail for you. Come in.

189
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,996
The Philippines a romantic place, huh?
I painted a new painting.

190
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,076
Christmas in New England.

191
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,434
- It's beautiful.
- You really like it?

192
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,516
Well, it's unfinished.

193
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,596
Will you be with us for a while?

194
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,316
Yes, I'll be working
in the Pentagon again. Thank you.

195
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,079
Great. It's always a pleasure
to have you back.

196
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,196
Oh, my God.

197
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,673
Hello.

198
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,712
The Ancient Mariner. Not so ancient.

199
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,316
I'm wasted!

200
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,999
I'm so happy to see you. When did
you get back and why didn't you call me?

201
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,429
- I did call you.
- I wrote you.

202
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,109
But I'm only semiliterate,
so it was wastebasket time.

203
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,629
If you caught gonorrhoea, I'll kill you.

204
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,749
- I'm wearing too many clothes.
- It doesn't feel like anything.

205
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,031
Talk about feeling like
it's not wearing anything...

206
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,074
- You're gonna blush.
- You are a very bad girl.

207
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,918
Hold it.

208
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,996
I mean the blush.

209
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,435
God, I'm so embarrassed.

210
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,079
- What are you doin'?
- I wanna get a picture of this.

211
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,510
- No! No pictures.
- Naval hero blushes. You're proud.

212
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,598
I'm not proud. I'm serious.

213
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,550
Don't take a picture of me.

214
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,636
Come on.

215
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,594
- Give me that.
- You jiggled the camera.

216
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,116
You pervert.

217
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,233
I think I did this way too early.

218
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,832
Looks like a baboon
in a closet at midnight.

219
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,233
Good morning, Mr Pritchard.
Go right in.

220
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,715
- May I take your hat, sir?
- Thank you.

221
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,276
Commander.

222
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,997
- Glad to have you with us.
- Nice to be here. Thank you, sir.

223
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,429
Scott has a very high opinion of you.

224
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,552
- Are you familiar with your new duties?
- No, sir.

225
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,750
Then this meeting is premature.

226
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,635
- Tom only arrived here yesterday, sir.
- Well, since you're here...

227
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,991
You'll function as liaison,
under Scott's supervision,

228
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,590
between this office
and the intelligence community.

229
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,150
Calling those piranhas a community
is one of life's ironies.

230
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,874
You'll meet regularly
with each of the agencies,

231
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,197
but for now I am primarily
concerned with the CIA.

232
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,875
Sir?

233
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,072
- Are you aware of the Phantom sub?
- Yes, sir.

234
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,829
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

235
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,238
The Phantom sub is meant to be invisible
to sonar. The builder's first instinct...

236
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,430
I should say his second instinct,

237
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,634
his first being to get his snout as
deeply as possible into the public trough.

238
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,231
Anyway, they wanna build a submarine
roughly the size of an aircraft carrier.

239
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,592
The Russians won't need sonar. They'll
just see this huge bulge out in the ocean.

240
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,236
It's my plan to terminate this programme.
There'll be Congressional resistance,

241
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,635
chiefly from Senator Duvall.

242
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,557
EXcuse me. Scott.

243
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,955
What's worrying
is his connection to the CIA.

244
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,915
We eXpect them to feed him with inflated
estimates of Soviet research in the field.

245
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,952
To counter him, we need access
to the same information.

246
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,959
Not self-serving gloss, but the raw data
they base their conclusions on.

247
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,310
- Your job is to get it.
- Yes, sir.

248
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,512
But raw data from the CIA...
My eXperience at ONl...

249
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,269
They'll either give it to us or they won't.
If they do, then I'm correct.

250
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,437
If they do not, I will use it
against them with the President.

251
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,599
- You realise I speak in complete candour.
- Yes, sir.

252
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,676
Senator Duvall...

253
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,917
Senator Duvall is motivated
by this absurd lust...

254
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,553
Sit down.

255
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,636
This absurd lust for power.

256
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,911
Now, this would be comic
if it wasn't so damn dangerous.

257
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,395
Marshall at the CIA is his...

258
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,992
creature.

259
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,910
You are above this kind of political
unpleasantness. That's why I chose you.

260
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,437
Go with Scott and get to know
the background material.

261
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,154
Let's cut the protocol.
In the absence of a demur,

262
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,352
I'll assume your responses
are in the affirmative.

263
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,991
Lorraine,
get my wife on the phone, please.

264
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,916
I think he likes you.

265
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,436
This is the situation room.

266
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,238
And right this way, sir,
is the computer centre.

267
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,115
Did I mention, sir, that
I'm very pleased to be working for you?

268
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,516
This is a Sperry 90l80.
All the terminals in this room are for it.

269
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,837
It interfaces with the IBM 370s
at NSA headquarters.

270
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,873
It works programs for COM-SEC,
SIGINT, personnel command,

271
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,639
- the bureau of alcohol and fire...
- I get your gist.

272
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,311
- That's the systems analyst. Let me...
- I know who it is. Sam Hesselman.

273
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,512
Good to see you. Why didn't you call
when you got into town?

274
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,677
- I don't know. Why didn't we call?
- Sir?

275
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,197
It's good to see you, Tom.
You look great. Come in the office.

276
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,877
- Mr FoX, take a break.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,310
- Are you back here for good?
- Well, I'm stationed here again.

278
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,670
- How the hell are you?
- Can't complain.

279
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,519
- Helen and the kids ask about you.
- Good.

280
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,596
The kids loved the ashtray.

281
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,034
They didn't know a donkey could do that.

282
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,709
Tom, this is Kevin O'Brien of the CIA. I've
eXplained that you're taking over liaison.

283
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,877
- Kevin will be your contact.
- It's good to meet you.

284
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,309
If there's anything I can do,
let me know.

285
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,954
I'm just getting my feet wet
trying to catch up.

286
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,039
Oh? I assumed that because you didn't
wanna wait until the regular meeting...

287
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,550
I'm certain there are questions
that Commander Farrell must have.

288
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,276
No. I'm not sufficiently prepared.
I wouldn't wanna waste your time.

289
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,193
- Well, gentlemen, if you'll eXcuse me...
- Maybe there is one thing.

290
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,756
The secretary asked me to help him
prepare for the NATO meeting.

291
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,758
I'd like to know
the Russian intelligence estimates.

292
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,430
We submit a report
on the first of the month.

293
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,868
It'd be a big help if you could send
what you have as of now.

294
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,912
- I'll put something together.
- I'd appreciate it.

295
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,996
Don't mention it.

296
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,038
That was deftly handled.
For a moment there I thought...

297
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,630
Just trying to be subtle.
It's my job, isn't it?

298
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,109
- Was this a present?
- Yeah.

299
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:41,435
- He gave it to me.
- Oh? He has eXpensive taste, this guy.

300
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,076
Didn't cost anything.
Some foreign minister gave it to him.

301
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,273
So in other words we're dealing with
a guy foreign ministers give presents to?

302
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,313
- Don't start that stuff.
- I didn't say anything.

303
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,035
You don't have to say anything.
You never say a word.

304
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,870
I thought I wasn't supposed to.

305
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,634
You know what I mean. You get that
wounded, disapproving look on your face.

306
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,274
Ask me a question and I'll answer it.

307
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,516
It's David Brice, secretary of defense.
Satisfied?

308
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,475
You know I work for Brice?

309
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,992
That makes two of us.

310
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,436
Did you take care of everything?

311
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:44,475
Yes. I'm supposed to pick Miss Atwell up
at eight... if she remembers.

312
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,160
- You don't approve of Susan, do you?
- Sir?

313
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,593
She's a bright and eXciting woman.
Can't you see that?

314
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,676
Not eXactly, I guess.

315
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,040
All right, I'm a pain in the ass.

316
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,153
But this one can do things for me
like no other woman I've ever met.

317
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,279
It's the only other thing worth living for.

318
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,875
What is the big deal about tonight?

319
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,195
He likes to see me in public.

320
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,709
So what does he get? A secret hard-on?

321
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,796
Try and understand.

322
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,950
- I'll call you later tonight.
- I'll wait by the phone.

323
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,316
- Hello, Scott.
- Miss Atwell.

324
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,955
- Two white wines, please.
- Mr Brice.

325
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:25,915
Mr Marshall and I have been having
a little debate on government service.

326
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,476
Now, I claim that the fella
with the appointed job -

327
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,799
well, he sorta comes and he goes at
the pleasure of this or that administration.

328
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,036
He sorta blows in the wind,

329
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,359
whereas the elected official,
well, he serves the people directly.

330
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,233
He has to be more responsible.

331
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,669
What do you think, Mr Secretary?

332
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,031
Senator Duvall,
I think it's getting very late.

333
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,556
Thank you.

334
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,629
Who's that man licking Duvall's ear?
I recognise him.

335
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,594
I would hope so. That's Marshall.
He's the director of the CIA.

336
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,276
You would hope so.

337
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,436
No, thank you.

338
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,836
Commander.

339
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,599
- So nice you could make it.
- Thank you, sir.

340
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,073
Ladies and gentlemen...

341
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,350
It's good of you to come and help us
celebrate our national day.

342
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,309
After all, we're a small country, far away.

343
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,673
We've got a little entertainment for you
which I'm sure you're going to enjoy.

344
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,236
I'll be right back.

345
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,471
- Hi.
- Hi.

346
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,956
- You're going away?
- Just for the weekend.

347
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,233
Perhaps a romantic interlude, yes?

348
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,509
Perhaps.

349
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,596
If I intrude on your privacy,
for this I am sorry.

350
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,518
"It's not just a job. It's an adventure."

351
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,953
What are you eating? You're eating bugs?

352
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,753
I gotta have another one.

353
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,677
- There you go.
- That is really disgusting.

354
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,316
I love Tom Farrell.

355
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,751
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

356
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,836
Hold on.

357
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,116
Thank you.

358
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,948
- Thank you very much.
- I want you to take care of us.

359
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,878
- I will. You guys newlyweds?
- You can go.

360
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,956
Thank you.

361
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,712
You're beautiful.

362
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,400
- Mr and Mrs Smith?
- A romantic gesture.

363
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,591
Very original.

364
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,676
I spelt it with a Y.

365
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,556
- Hi.
- Hey there.

366
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,875
We wanna rent a boat.

367
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,476
20 bucks an hour. Take your pick.

368
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,798
That's all right, but we don't want
a plastic toy. We want something like this.

369
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,478
- No, no.
- Why not?

370
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,353
That's my boss's boat. It ain't for rent.

371
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,436
Well, I want it.

372
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,756
Don't do this.

373
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,471
You're bad.

374
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,390
You know what you're doin'? It's gustin'
like a son of a bitch out there. One more.

375
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,033
God, I wish the navy was still like this.

376
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,756
Let's get ready. We'll come about.

377
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,596
- Give me a kiss.
- OK.

378
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,868
We're gonna come over here.
Let me get it off.

379
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,956
- Ready?
- No, not yet.

380
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,230
- OK, whenever you are.
- OK. I'm ready.

381
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,749
- Say "Helm's alee".
- Helm's alee!

382
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,192
- Good.
- Yeah!

383
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,153
Hello.

384
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,989
Oh, hi, Nina.
Tom and I just got back this minute.

385
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,156
OK.

386
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,159
Yeah.

387
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,509
Can I call you later?

388
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,076
Bye.

389
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,835
Well, it didn't take him long, did it?

390
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,392
That was Nina, so don't.

391
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,629
Don't what?

392
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,550
Oh, no. Tom...

393
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,194
David's here. Oh, my God.

394
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,794
I'm begging you.
Just go now out the back door.

395
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,116
- I'm sorry. Just...
- When I go, it'll be through the front door.

396
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,950
As a favour to me, just this one time.

397
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,036
Please. Please go.

398
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,957
I promise I'll work everything out,
all right?

399
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,517
Tom, please.

400
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,390
Why don't you fucking go down
and beg him not to come in?.

401
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,630
You want me to say it? I'll say it.

402
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,634
I'll leave him. I promise I will.
I'll leave him.

403
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,596
I love you.

404
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,676
You've been out of town.

405
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,590
And you have a pleasant flush.

406
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,280
- I got some sun.
- How nice.

407
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,834
- And with whom did you get this sun?
- What?

408
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,997
"What?" I said who were you with
this weekend?

409
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,636
Nobody.

410
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,832
Well, I find that hard to believe,
that you'd go away completely alone.

411
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,839
- I didn't say I was completely alone.
- You said you weren't with anybody.

412
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,515
I mean nobody you know.

413
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,790
I know a great many people. How can you
be certain it's somebody I don't know?

414
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,677
You want a drink?

415
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,870
He's a man I know.

416
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,196
It's of no importance.

417
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,117
I'm sure it's of no importance to you
whom you sleep with,

418
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,595
but it's of considerable
importance to me.

419
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,676
Why worry? There's plenty left.

420
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,958
Get out of here, you bastard. Get out!
I'm calling the police. Get out!

421
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,555
I wanna know who it was.

422
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,040
Listen to me, goddamn it. I pay the rent.

423
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,636
Get out of here.

424
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,916
All right. Wait a minute.

425
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,395
I'm sorry I slapped you, all right?

426
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,476
Get out of here.

427
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,517
No! Dammit...

428
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,108
- Listen, you tell me who...
- No.

429
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,834
- Tell me who it is!
- He's not a pig like you!

430
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,869
Susan!

431
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,190
David. What's the matter?

432
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,432
I think I killed Susan.

433
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,440
- What happened?
- I killed her.

434
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,550
I just needed to talk
before I go to the police.

435
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,035
Sit down. Sit down.

436
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,358
It was an accident. I didn't mean to...

437
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,836
She was with some man
and I just must have gone crazy.

438
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,028
The man was there? He saw you?

439
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,316
He saw me go in, yeah.

440
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,596
Who is he?

441
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,116
It was dark.

442
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,956
Then maybe he didn't see you.

443
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,358
I parked my car. I stood under the light.

444
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,676
He saw me.

445
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,950
I can't come to the phone,

446
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,356
but when you hear the beep,
tell me everything.

447
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,356
Did she ever photograph you?

448
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,118
No.

449
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,477
This is a negative side of a Polaroid.
I found it under the bed.

450
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,752
- Are you absolutely certain?
- I'm certain. I'm not that big a fool.

451
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,595
Then we have to find
the man who saw you.

452
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,513
What if... the search for this man
was of vital national security?

453
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,791
A secret operation that we could control.

454
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,270
- It won't hold up to scrutiny.
- We'll invent an eXcuse for the search.

455
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,188
The important thing is to abort
an investigation of Susan's death

456
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,356
- before it ever gets to you.
- No.

457
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,829
- It's a house of cards. There is no Yuri.
- It doesn't matter.

458
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:53,034
All the intelligence agencies believe that
there's a mole in the defense department.

459
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,957
You know the theory.

460
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,629
That Yuri was sent here by the KGB
while he was still in his teens,

461
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,957
and for all intents and purposes
he can pass as an American.

462
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,868
They've been talking about that
for four years. It's the CIA's wet dream.

463
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,232
- There's never been a shred of evidence.
- But now there is.

464
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,909
He was the man
who spent the weekend with Susan.

465
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,508
He was the man who killed her.

466
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:27,200
Lorraine, would you ask CID
to get all the material on Yuri

467
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,598
and then bring it into the secretary
as soon as possible? Thank you.

468
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,836
I don't think we can bring this off.

469
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,916
You can.

470
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,271
Good morning, Major.

471
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,356
- Morning.
- Thank you.

472
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,795
If military intelligence can catch this
KGB agent without outside assistance,

473
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,992
it will immeasurably
strengthen us against the CIA.

474
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:08,240
This has to move like lightning, before
anyone gets on to what we're doing.

475
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,635
Assume control of the investigation.

476
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,274
Responsibility is consonant
with your office.

477
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,312
I have implicit trust in you
to keep this under wraps.

478
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,838
You're to report to me
or to Secretary Brice only.

479
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,236
- I plan to remain here around the clock.
- What do the police know?

480
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,553
They haven't been informed.
CID has taken the body to Fort Meade.

481
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,271
If we go looking for a Russian spy without
the FBI or the CIA, it's gonna raise hell.

482
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,834
That's my problem.

483
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,836
Well, what do we have
on the dead woman?

484
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,999
It's through Yuri's association with
this woman that we'll be able to find him.

485
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,351
Here's everything we know about her
for the moment.

486
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,955
It looks like
he spent the weekend with her.

487
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,119
He brought her home
and killed her around midnight.

488
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,073
I'm counting on it not being too hard
to find out where they'd been.

489
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,239
Yeah... Yes.

490
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,397
- I'm certain the investigation will...
- Will you eXcuse me?

491
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,990
- Commander Farrell, are we boring you?
- No, sir. May l...?

492
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,628
- We can't even convince our own people.
- It's all right.

493
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,996
Get Donovan in here.

494
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,796
Commander, if you please.

495
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,393
Major Donovan
of the criminal investigation division.

496
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,115
His men will conduct the investigation
subject to your orders.

497
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,232
We're set up
down in the situation room, Commander.

498
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,115
We have to have a front man.

499
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,311
- They're autopsying the body.
- I wanna see her apartment.

500
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,591
- I don't think that'll be necessary.
- Maybe not, but I want to.

501
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,109
- They're autopsying the body now.
- Good.

502
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,879
- Scott, I wanna see her apartment.
- Mr Pritchard...

503
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,117
CID will do a better job.
It's important that you remain here.

504
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,597
I've got men checking for physical
evidence. The print people are just back.

505
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,474
- What did they find?
- All fragments or smudged. It was clean.

506
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,832
- What's going on?
- A matter of the utmost importance.

507
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,077
- What is this?
- We're checking calls made this week

508
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,192
- to see if her number comes up.
- There's gotta be millions.

509
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:54,198
We interface with the phone company,
monitoring every call in a 50-mile radius.

510
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,278
We're checking gas station
and hotel credit card receipts.

511
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,233
- Who is this bimbo anyway?
- She's dead.

512
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,876
One billfold... A bracelet.

513
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,958
- This is the evidence from her house?
- Yes, sir.

514
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,996
One boX of candy mints.

515
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,956
Got one brown hairbrush.

516
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,998
Commander Farrell is on his way in. We'll
have a report on the house-to-house soon.

517
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,270
- What's this?
- Polaroid negatives.

518
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,831
- I can't make anything out.
- If there's silver left on the emulsion,

519
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,679
we may be able
to bring out the picture. EXcuse me.

520
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,678
Sergeant,
get this right over to the photo lab.

521
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:49,470
Sir... Commander. Mr O'Brien
is waiting for you in your office.

522
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,239
We made an appointment
to go over the CIA report.

523
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,989
- Just cancel it.
- If we do, he'll go away suspicious.

524
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,916
That's true.

525
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:08,074
I'll be in Commander Farrell's office.
Could you call me in five minutes?

526
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,276
Sorry it took so long.

527
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:16,438
- This is the official estimate.
- An advance copy. Isn't it what you want?

528
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,796
Pritchard here.

529
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,036
Yes, of course.

530
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:27,757
Sorry. I'm wanted in the secretary's office.
I suggest that we reschedule this meeting.

531
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,872
- Commander Farrell and I can continue.
- The Commander...

532
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,436
- That would be satisfactory.
- We're both requested at the meeting.

533
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,869
I'm afraid we really must stop.

534
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,912
Kevin, I was wondering if you might
help me in the counterespionage...

535
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,315
Tom, we'd better get to that meeting.

536
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:53,039
Commander, when you get more time,
you give me a call.

537
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,549
I can be reached 24 hours a day.

538
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,910
Good.

539
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,876
What was that supposed to be?

540
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,991
Thought I might get something on Yuri.

541
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,873
What we have will be quite sufficient.

542
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,311
- I want all outgoing calls monitored.
- All calls?

543
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,431
- Brice's lines are safe.
- I'll see to it.

544
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,515
Now.

545
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,238
- What's that?
- Autopsy. She died of a broken neck.

546
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,432
Here's a list of her stomach contents.

547
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,437
What the hell for?

548
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,835
There are chemical pollutants in food.

549
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,793
We might pin down
where she ate her last day.

550
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,714
Stay close to the centre of things, but
do nothing until you're instructed by me.

551
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,877
- Who are they?
- They're associated with Special Forces.

552
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,309
I don't understand. What's that mean?

553
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,911
EXactly what I said. They were formerly in
Special Forces. Now they are associated.

554
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,508
- Honduras? EI Salvador?
- Somewhere down there.

555
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,916
You were with the death squads?
Were they with the death squads?

556
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,917
- It's possible.
- They're assassins.

557
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,318
You needn't concern yourself.
They work for me now. Leave us, please.

558
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,670
You haven't told me everything.

559
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,276
The Atwell woman knew Brice.

560
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,676
She was his mistress.

561
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,916
Naturally, Brice had no idea of her
connection with a Soviet agent.

562
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,713
We only found out last night
after the murder.

563
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,196
Brice is in an impossible situation.
We should call in the FBl.

564
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,276
Don't be an idiot.

565
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,477
Do you realise
the magnitude of the scandal?

566
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,273
The secretary of defense
and a Soviet agent

567
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,039
sharing the favours of a murdered whore?

568
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,472
- David might even be a suspect.
- I think that's something to consider.

569
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:05,879
Well, it isn't speculation, Tom. Brice
was with me at the time of the murder.

570
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,037
- He couldn't have done it.
- Fine. Then call in the FBI

571
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,277
- and let Brice take his chances.
- That decision is not yours.

572
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,188
What we will do is catch this Yuri
before anyone knows what's happened.

573
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,517
- Then we'll handle the rest.
- You mean the men in the neXt room.

574
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:24,156
The man is a spy and a murderer. Would
anyone deny that justice had been done?

575
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,909
- Yeah, I would.
- We shall have that discussion later,

576
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,474
but for now I eXpect you to follow orders

577
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,991
and demonstrate the loyalty to which
both the secretary and I have every right.

578
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:38,271
- You eXpect a lot.
- I depend on you. We're friends.

579
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:44,873
And, Tom, if it were your intention to do
anything to bring down David Brice,

580
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,629
then I'd have no choice but to make sure
that you didn't get away with it.

581
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,112
- Thank you for the warning.
- I'm certain it's unnecessary.

582
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:57,199
When you calm down, you'll see
we're following the only possible course.

583
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,629
I gave them the estimates.
They couldn't have cared less.

584
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,356
Get me Senator Duvall.

585
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,032
What's all this top-secret business
I've been hearing about?

586
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,558
Here's what we do have.
CID is running a phone check.

587
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,956
They're looking for all calls
placed to a Susan Atwell.

588
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,640
- Who's she?
- She's in the morgue at Fort Meade.

589
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,832
- She was murdered last night.
- Do we know anything about it?

590
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,191
Get ready for this.
We think she's either David Brice's

591
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,595
or Scott Pritchard's mistress.

592
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,390
She was seen with both of them.
It didn't seem high priority,

593
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,273
so my people have been
a little laX in following it up.

594
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,757
Well, spilt milk... And you can forget
about Pritchard. He's homoseXual.

595
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,114
I'll be damned.

596
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,596
So will he, if you believe
the Old Testament. Who killed her?

597
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,679
We don't know. They got CID believing
that they're searching for Yuri.

598
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,273
Don't tell me anybody swallowed that.

599
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,075
That poor son of a bitch Brice.

600
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,518
You know, I almost feel sorry for him.

601
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,110
- Who's running things at the Pentagon?
- The new boy. Farrell.

602
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,754
So he can take the fall
in case anything goes wrong.

603
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,348
He looked like a man
who'd like a heart-to-heart.

604
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,356
Senator Duvall.

605
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:40,234
Yeah, listen, Billy. I've been hearing some
disturbing news about the Phantom sub.

606
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,879
I tried to talk to the President about NATO.

607
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,075
All he wanted to talk about
was the Phantom sub.

608
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,760
Why the crunch on that
has to come now is beyond me.

609
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,509
- We'll just have to handle it.
- You've got me handling a hell of a lot.

610
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,476
Yeah. Hold.

611
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,040
Commander. Line two, the other phone.

612
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,956
I'll call you back.

613
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,350
I'll be right down.

614
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,870
- They want me in the computer centre.
- I'll go with you.

615
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,869
Oh, yeah. By all means, go with him.

616
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,075
- What is it, Sam?
- There's no more image

617
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,760
they can get out of this Polaroid.

618
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,872
Damn. Too much to hope for.
We'll just have to forget it.

619
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,276
Maybe not.
There's something I wanna show you.

620
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,670
Now, this is as bad
as your Polaroid, right?

621
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,873
Now watch. This is a training tape.
I'm speeding it up.

622
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,468
The picture is broken down into piXels,

623
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,229
the smallest element on the emulsion,
sort of an atom of the picture.

624
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,830
Then, and this is the good part,
the computer just asks itself

625
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,315
what would be where
if we adjust the piXels.

626
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,554
- That's all there is to it?
- We have to keep on top of the computer.

627
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,592
Computers don't think.
If we had programmed this

628
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:04,350
to come out a car instead of a monkey,
you'd be looking at a hairy Buick.

629
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,754
- All right. Just get started on it.
- It takes billions of calculations.

630
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,838
The whole process may take 12 hours
or it may take a week.

631
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,916
Well, that's too long.

632
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,435
Perhaps you can get what you need
from the work in progress.

633
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,552
- We'll watch it on this screen.
- We've got our first number.

634
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:26,992
It's listed to a Nina Beka. She called
last night about the time of the murder.

635
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,271
- I'd better see her.
- I was just about to send my men.

636
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,916
Are you Miss Nina Beka?

637
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,716
- Yes.
- I'm Commander Farrell.

638
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:55,674
This is Mr Pritchard, general counsel
to the secretary of defense.

639
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,756
May we come in?

640
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,836
Please, do come in.

641
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,997
I'm afraid that we have
some bad news for you.

642
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,558
A woman named Susan Atwell is dead.

643
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,196
She was a friend of yours?

644
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,116
Yes, she is.

645
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,235
In what way were you acquainted?

646
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,879
You see, I work at Shalini's boutique

647
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,870
in the Pavilion.
She used to come in there sometimes.

648
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,198
We'd like you to tell us
as much about her as possible.

649
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:43,630
We think she was killed
by a man she'd been seeing.

650
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:48,310
- Why?
- You needn't concern yourself with why.

651
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,352
We just need the names
of the men she... consorted with.

652
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,950
- "Consorted with"?
- Yes.

653
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,275
- I don't know about Susan's personal life.
- I'll ask you again.

654
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,356
Who were the men she saw?

655
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,154
You can ask me a thousand times and the
answer will be the same. I don't know it.

656
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,396
You're South African.

657
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,188
- That's right.
- I don't see a US visa.

658
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,470
You're an illegal alien.

659
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,350
Do you know who I am?

660
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:28,397
I can pick up that phone and I can have
you on the first plane to Johannesburg.

661
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:33,116
I'm assuming that you have a reason
for not wanting to be there.

662
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,830
You guessed right.

663
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,916
I know who you are.

664
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,996
I know who Brice is.

665
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,112
David Brice.
Is that the name you're looking for?

666
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:48,198
We're not interested in him.
There's another man we want.

667
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,756
Well, in that case,

668
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,716
why don't we make a deal?

669
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,479
We'll talk about it.
Who was the other man?

670
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,230
Who was the other man?!

671
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,636
It was someone at the Pentagon.

672
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,548
- Does he have a name?
- I suppose so, but I don't know it.

673
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,676
Listen...

674
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:24,593
All I know is that Susan used to see him
and he reappeared.

675
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,269
- How recently? Three months?
- I don't know!

676
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,312
A month, three weeks.
Who cares? I don't know it.

677
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,000
She never discussed
these things with me.

678
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:40,029
That'll do for now. We'll close the part
of the investigation that concerns you.

679
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,758
Thank you, Miss Beka.
You've been very helpful.

680
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:03,395
Sam. I want the names
of all civilian and military personnel

681
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,830
assigned to the Pentagon during
the past two months. Can you do it?

682
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,758
It's all in the computer.
I'll set up a program to find it.

683
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,472
Mr Pritchard.

684
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:15,479
Tom, I've got a suggestion.
We're doing this credit card search,

685
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:19,513
but nothing charged over the weekend
would be turned in so soon.

686
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:24,395
- We're wasting valuable computer time.
- I know. I want you to keep on with it.

687
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,795
- What's this all about?
- We'll talk later.

688
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,309
- What is this?
- I have to see Secretary Brice.

689
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,193
Just get started
on that list of new employees.

690
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:36,836
Yeah. We isolated three pollutants
in the dead girl's stomach contents.

691
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,599
They're the red, green
and blue lines on the graph.

692
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:44,157
If we can get the overlays to match,
we might pinpoint where she was.

693
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:48,432
So far, it looks like
somewhere near Upper Chesapeake Bay.

694
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,352
Come in.

695
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,629
EXcuse me, sir.
Have you seen Major Donovan?

696
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,672
- No.
- It's important that I get this to him.

697
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:08,351
- What do you have here?
- Well, we missed it the first time round.

698
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,950
It must have fallen
under the seat of her car.

699
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,435
I'll take care of this.

700
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,076
Very well, sir.

701
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,875
- Was this a present?
- Yeah.

702
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,356
- He gave it to me.
- He has expensive taste.

703
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:32,031
Didn't cost anything.
Some foreign minister gave it to him.

704
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:38,439
I pride myself on being
a man of forbearance and conciliation.

705
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,996
But if you fuck me on this, I'll crucify you!

706
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:44,031
I am not your rubber stamp.

707
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,516
You have run roughshod over this office
for 20 years. That's over.

708
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,757
Sir, you may disparage
your predecessors all you like,

709
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,997
but I don't recall in the past
any secret investigation

710
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:59,274
that required the entire department of
defense, circumvented CIA and the FBI

711
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,154
- and the Washington police!
- We're not locked into any position

712
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,430
- on the Phantom sub.
- What are you saying?

713
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:09,758
I'm just trying to allay Senator Duvall's
fears that we might act peremptorily.

714
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:12,235
We will act the way I decide
on this matter.

715
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:16,349
Gentlemen, I don't see any point
in squabbling like children.

716
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,678
Mr Pritchard,
I am encouraged by your attitude.

717
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:24,430
I'm sure your investigation,
whatever it is, is perfectly proper.

718
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,313
I must apologise
for my unseemly outburst.

719
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:32,116
- It's just that I've been sorely troubled.
- It's perfectly understandable, Senator.

720
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,800
I'm certain that we can reach
an accommodation.

721
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,276
Gentlemen, I'm deeply gratified.

722
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:44,635
Deeply gratified, and I hope you'll forgive
my imposition on such a busy day.

723
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,829
- He's got us.
- This is insane. It's out of control.

724
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,872
- Your cover story's not gonna hold water.
- Yes, it will,

725
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,992
but you have to have
more moral courage.

726
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:14,031
Have you ever heard of a woman
named Nina Beka?

727
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,391
No.

728
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,476
Well, she's heard of you.

729
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,908
Instruct the CIA
to contact you at your home.

730
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,349
Remain there
and wait for the information.

731
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:28,631
You're not to call me.
I'll check in with you periodically.

732
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,156
- As quickly as possible.
- OK.

733
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,396
Hey. You two!

734
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,355
- Where are they going?
- What's the matter?

735
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,675
- Laurel and Hardy.
- Who's that, Tom?

736
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:52,475
- You know who I mean. The bookends.
- I sent them on an errand.

737
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,634
- I need a car.
- I'm sorry. CID's got everything.

738
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:09,117
- This one. Bring this one down.
- You can't take that. The lift just busted.

739
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,152
- Watch your toes.
- Come on. Get out of there right now!

740
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,873
Shit.

741
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,676
- Shit.
- Hi.

742
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,830
Goddamn it, get him! Come on, hurry up.

743
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,996
What you doin'? You crazy?

744
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,556
You OK?

745
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,396
Look out.

746
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,275
I'm gonna get you, motherfucker.

747
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,398
Nina, come with me.

748
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,958
We can't talk. Is there a back way out?

749
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,959
- What happened to Susan?
- We cannot talk here. You're in danger.

750
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,116
- What's going on?
- It doesn't...

751
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,708
- Can I go to my place?
- No. They'll kill you.

752
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:37,076
You have to get lost, and I mean
really lost. Thank you for before.

753
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,956
- Go.
- There he is.

754
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,436
Look out. He's got a gun.

755
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:54,358
I think we should go back
to the Pentagon, sir.

756
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,434
That was a stupid, stupid thing you did.

757
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,317
- I think you're crazy.
- I'm going to save Brice, no matter what.

758
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,908
- I told you that.
- I don't believe there is a Yuri.

759
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,350
- He's real enough.
- He has nothing to do with the murder.

760
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,950
- We'll find out when we catch him.
- Not if those two get to him first.

761
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,595
Dammit! I am tired of weakness.

762
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:28,350
I am faced with a grave problem and
I intend to resolve it quickly and cleanly.

763
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:31,597
- You are crazy. Fucking cuckoo.
- I won't be insulted by you.

764
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:34,951
And you're not to interfere
with this investigation again.

765
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,036
Do I make myself clear?

766
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,035
- I quit.
- Your resignation is not accepted.

767
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,311
Tom, be reasonable.
I'm shielding you from full knowledge.

768
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:47,592
Just follow your orders and
everything'll be all right. Let him go.

769
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,276
Will you eXcuse me, please?

770
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:01,149
Hope you're not calling your girlfriend.
Remember, Big Brother's listening.

771
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,508
I don't give a shit.

772
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,868
- Hello.
- FoX.

773
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,438
Hello, sir. The writing on the box is
Arabic, but it's in the... Maghrebi dialect.

774
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,516
What they speak in Morocco.

775
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,791
What it says is kinda flowery,
but it boils down to:

776
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,036
"A gift to a true friend."

777
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,116
Good boy. You can come back now.

778
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:27,914
Tea.

779
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:36,556
The Polaroid just came on line.

780
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,750
Not much to look at, is it?

781
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,836
No, it's not.

782
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:47,553
Don't gifts from governments have to be
registered with the office of protocol?

783
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,035
- So they tell us.
- Are their files computerised?

784
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:53,152
Yes. They would be
in the department of state's computer.

785
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,236
Can we access those files?

786
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:00,353
They're closed. You'll have to
get in touch with them tomorrow.

787
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,955
I can't get in touch with them.

788
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,838
- We can interface.
- Can you do it now?

789
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,515
There'll be hell to pay.

790
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,878
Tom...

791
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,715
Does it matter to you that much?

792
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,471
OK.

793
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,113
Thanks. I'll be back in five minutes.

794
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,276
Come in.

795
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,196
What is it now?

796
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,559
I've been thinking it over
and maybe you're right.

797
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,238
Yes?

798
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:02,275
Let's just get this whole business
over with. And I'm sorry I blew up at you.

799
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,156
We're all very tired.

800
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,275
When this is out of the way,
we can do great things here.

801
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,434
Well... first things first, huh?

802
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,868
How are we doin'?

803
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,594
I'm into the state department computer.
It was easy.

804
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,280
- Can you print that out for me?
- You got it.

805
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,549
A lot of paper. Oh, and you were right
about the credit card receipts.

806
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:44,240
We found one from a gas station
in Annapolis.

807
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,556
Great.

808
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:53,799
- These the new people at the Pentagon?
- Yeah. There are 4700 possibles so far.

809
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:58,357
But we've had a real break. The CID
has pinned down your man's blood type.

810
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,760
- How'd they get that?
- Autopsy specimen.

811
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,830
There was a residue of semen
in the body. Blood type is A positive.

812
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,520
That's pretty common,
but it'll narrow the list.

813
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,636
You're a genius, Sam.

814
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,639
I am, I am.

815
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,676
You should get some sleep.
You must be eXhausted.

816
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,795
I know if I'm eXhausted or not.

817
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,716
As you say.

818
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:45,718
You look like
you just stepped out of a bandboX.

819
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,310
- You're actually enjoying this.
- I'm just trying to do my job.

820
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:53,512
It would be a lot easier
if you'd stop attacking me.

821
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:01,432
I'm sorry. I'm just tired.
I've got a lot on my mind.

822
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:10,070
If it doesn't keep moving towards
a coherent image, we adjust the program.

823
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:15,034
You mean you could stop it
and make it go in another direction?

824
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:18,789
We've been doing that all along.
It looks like it's doing fine now.

825
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,356
I'm not so sure.

826
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,674
I think it's time we had a talk.

827
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,520
I'm the one in the picture, Sam.

828
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,676
You?

829
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:16,755
Susan Atwell
was the woman I've been seeing.

830
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,316
I had nothing to do with her death.

831
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,075
I was in love with her.

832
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,796
Jesus. You must feel terrible.

833
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:32,871
You're the only one I can tell
that this spy-hunt is phoney.

834
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,675
- Yuri has nothing to do with the murder?
- Nothing.

835
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:41,793
This is a cover-up. That's all I can tell you.

836
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,480
- Come on!
- Goddamn it, Sam.

837
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,592
This is for your own protection, all right?

838
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:53,190
These people have already
tried to kill one person who knew.

839
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:57,996
- What do you want me to do?
- Slow up the resolution on that picture.

840
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:02,272
I need more time, Sam. I need more time
to get this straightened out.

841
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,955
That's what I need.

842
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:35,114
I'm not satisfied with the way this
is coming up. The eigenvalue is off.

843
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,639
Looks all right to me.

844
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:42,437
We're pulling away from our reference
information. Program a Fourier transform.

845
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,791
- That seems like a waste of time.
- Just do what I want, OK?

846
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,273
Take it easy. We're all working
the same amount of time.

847
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,073
I'm sorry, David. Just do it, please.

848
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,031
What are you looking for?

849
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,116
Fuck off.

850
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,316
Where are you going?

851
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,909
I'd rather do this myself.

852
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,508
You can listen if you want to.

853
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,156
Just wear that badge.

854
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,514
- This goes here?
- Yeah.

855
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,029
- Where are we goin'?
- Major Donovan's office.

856
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,390
You can give a description
of this guy to him.

857
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,353
- Who the hell's Donovan?
- Our commanding officer.

858
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,519
Hello. You know who this is?

859
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,358
I have to talk to you,
but I can't leave here now.

860
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,509
I'm on the damn payphone now!
It's probably not even safe.

861
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:17,992
All right. I'll come there
as soon as I can get away.

862
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,992
I'll be damned. That's him!
The one who rented the boat.

863
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,429
- Where?
- He just went around that corner!

864
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,796
Can you see him?

865
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,154
He's gone.

866
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,479
I'll get back to you.
Where have you been? Yuri's here.

867
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,160
- Buzz the secretary.
- They had a witness and...

868
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:58,317
- I know. Can I go in?
- Go right in.

869
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,908
Well, what are my orders... sir?

870
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,597
Close all the eXits. Hold your witness
while we decide what to do.

871
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,996
Yes, sir.

872
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,236
- Is Yuri here?
- So it would seem.

873
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:15,035
- This is splendid work, Tom.
- I've had all the eXits closed.

874
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:21,071
Well, why don't we empty the building
and have everybody file past this man?

875
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,839
The place would be swarming
with TV cameramen.

876
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:26,269
We'll take the witness round
room by room.

877
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:31,030
- It's the largest building in the world.
- But the only way we'll get any privacy.

878
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,116
I'll see to it.

879
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,558
- Major Donovan.
- Sir.

880
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:38,752
I suggest that all officers carry side arms.

881
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,599
The man we're after
has killed one person already.

882
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:44,712
Don't worry, Tom.
I don't eXpect you to carry one.

883
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,157
Tall or short? Thin or fat? Light or dark?

884
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:09,636
- That's right.
- You think this is some kind of joke?

885
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:13,435
What I'm trying to tell you,
the son of a bitch is average.

886
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,711
All right. Let's go find
this average son of a bitch.

887
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:23,349
Oh, yeah. I'm positive I remember this
guy. I always remember the good tippers.

888
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:36,037
CID has brought in another witness.
A bellboy from a hotel in Annapolis.

889
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,355
Now you can have two search parties.

890
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:43,355
That's great news.
We can move twice as fast.

891
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,751
I'll see to it.

892
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,598
You see, David? It's all coming together.

893
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,870
Dear God, I hope you're right.

894
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:24,758
All right. Down this corridor.
Make it quick.

895
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,396
Let's go.

896
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:01,310
It ain't him. I just rented the guy a boat.
Gimme a break. I'm sick of this shit.

897
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:17,911
- How much longer?
- We can't search all the building.

898
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:21,749
- It would take all night.
- We have shifts finishing at five and siX.

899
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,678
- What do we do then?
- Let them out through the mall entrance.

900
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,110
- We'll have both witnesses there.
- What do you think?

901
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:30,879
Television.

902
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,754
We haven't been allowed in, but we're told
there's a bottleneck ofhundreds,

903
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,519
perhaps thousands of people,
waiting to go home.

904
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:42,077
Those who have been allowed to leave
were cleared by members of the CID,

905
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:45,636
the criminal investigation
division of army intelligence.

906
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:49,469
Apparently, there's a search on
for a person who may be a spy,

907
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,876
trapped right now
inside the Pentagon itself.

908
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:58,028
We're going to follow events, and we'll get
back to you as the story continues.

909
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:00,993
Melissa Donaldson, WCDM,
at the Pentagon.

910
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:06,838
- He must have gotten out past us.
- No way. He's somewhere in the building.

911
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:09,870
We'll have to go back
to the room-to-room.

912
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,913
We'll go down to the basement, search
the situation room, computer compleX.

913
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:17,555
We'll start at the bottom
and work our way up. Let's do it.

914
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,912
- You're to initial this.
- What?

915
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:25,951
- You're to initial this.
- What is it?

916
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:29,709
Authorisation to release
the Atwell woman's body for burial.

917
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:39,430
- We're down to 50 with A positive blood.
- How many are men?

918
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:44,315
Come on. Nobody told me I had to sort
'em out by seX. I gotta take a break, man.

919
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,396
Sam, I need to talk to you.

920
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:59,154
- I need your help.
- I slowed it up as much as I could.

921
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,158
- But they'll recognise it soon.
- What more I can do?

922
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:05,158
- They mean to kill me.
- You haven't slept for two days.

923
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,589
I'm telling you,
I don't stand a chance in hell.

924
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:11,235
For God's sakes, why? lf you had nothing
to do with the murder, why...?

925
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,669
- Brice killed her.
- Brice?

926
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,792
- She was his mistress.
- I thought she was your...

927
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,236
This...

928
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:21,669
Antique gold boX...

929
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:25,588
A present to Brice from the Moroccan
government. He gave it to Susan.

930
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:30,669
It's the only way I can prove he knew her.
He'll call off the search. I know he will.

931
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,115
- I see.
- Do you believe me?

932
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:39,237
Well, then, can you insert that
into the state department's computer?

933
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:42,639
- I could do that.
- I know you can, Sam, but...

934
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,876
will you?

935
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,629
- I'll do whatever I have to do to help you.
- Then let's do it.

936
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,873
There's nothing there.

937
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,833
- If you want a piece of paper, type it.
- Can't we just print?

938
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:33,272
The computer is searching for
where to insert it and then it'll print out!

939
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,356
- All right. How long?
- Soon.

940
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:41,308
First two on the right, second two
on the left, last man in the doorway.

941
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,908
- Nobody in or out.
- What's going on here?

942
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,793
- We're gonna search in here.
- Who told you to come here?

943
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:49,559
Nobody. This is the only area
that hasn't been covered.

944
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:58,350
All right, we'll be conducting a search
in here, and I ask you all, please...

945
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,436
- Sir, wait...
- Oh, Jesus.

946
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:03,593
I have to change.

947
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:09,830
- OK. Let's get going.
- Don't let anyone pass.

948
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,516
Sam Hesselman.

949
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:40,075
Look, I'm sorry to bother you,
but this is over my head.

950
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:43,156
It's about Commander Farrell.

951
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,836
I'm not sure...

952
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,355
I'm not sure he knows what he's doing.

953
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:57,314
All right, I'll meet you. Please
don't mention this to anybody else.

954
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:00,989
The reason I called you
was because I know you're his friend.

955
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,076
You did the right thing.

956
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:11,351
- This door is locked.
- Anybody have a master key?

957
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:18,718
- Isn't this Commander Farrell's office?
- We'd better have a look anyway.

958
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:33,793
There we go. Maybe this one's better.

959
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:02,069
Nobody here. Let's get on up the hall
and see what else we can come up with.

960
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:21,636
Hi.

961
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:24,988
What's this all about, Dr Hesselman?

962
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:30,198
Promise me that what I tell you
won't go any further.

963
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,436
I feel disloyal enough as it is.

964
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:33,788
Of course.

965
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,558
You understand that Tom
is under great strain.

966
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:40,716
Yes.

967
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:43,229
He knew the girl who was murdered.

968
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,998
They were very close.

969
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,672
And he thinks
that Secretary Brice killed her.

970
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:57,318
Look, I know him. He's much more
high-strung than he appears.

971
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,396
And this girl...

972
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:02,916
I guess he was in love with her.

973
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:07,109
Now he thinks that
somebody wants to kill him.

974
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:10,312
He asked me to reprogram
the computers and I did it.

975
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,476
But now...

976
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,718
I don't know. I just don't know.

977
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,839
I see. Where is Commander Farrell now?

978
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:23,996
I suppose he's in his office
or in the computer room.

979
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:26,076
Thank you.

980
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:38,155
Son of a bitch.

981
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:46,038
Hold it right there! Hold it!

982
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:49,755
I am your superior officer. I'm giving you
an order to arrest this man!

983
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:52,440
- I have my orders from Mr Pritchard.
- Do it!

984
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:54,516
- I have my orders...
- Shut up.

985
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:59,838
- If he resists, shoot him!
- Where are you going?

986
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:03,748
You can't go in there.
I said you can't go in there!

987
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:07,192
- What right do you have to come in?
- Call off the search.

988
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:11,029
You're not hunting a spy, but somebody
who knows Susan was your mistress.

989
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:11,910
What?

990
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:14,759
You gave her a gold boX
that a foreign minister gave you.

991
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,348
- Nonsense.
- You declared it to the office of protocol.

992
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:21,632
- I never declared anything.
- You tell it to the state's computer.

993
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:22,510
What?

994
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:27,350
You tell it to the state department. Pick up
the phone and call off the search now!

995
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,914
Do it, or I swear to God
I'll nail you to the wall.

996
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:33,032
Calm down. I'll get Scott in... Come in!

997
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,434
I'm sorry.
I had to make sure you were all right.

998
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,199
Yuri must be close.
There's been a murder.

999
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:44,475
He shot Dr Hesselman.

1000
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:47,717
- Goddamn it.
- What's happened, Major?

1001
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:52,072
I think Yuri's cornered. He's somewhere
between here and the gymnasium.

1002
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,919
Very good, Major.
Just continue the search.

1003
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:07,189
You had those apes kill him, didn't you?

1004
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:08,829
No.

1005
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:11,520
You lying sack of shit.

1006
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:17,076
Tom is the man who saw you at Susan's.

1007
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,953
He's known about you all along.
Isn't that right?

1008
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:23,509
You know what that means, David.

1009
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:26,313
If Commander Farrell
was with Miss Atwell,

1010
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:29,718
then Commander Farrell
is the man who killed Miss Atwell.

1011
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:33,435
And we know that the man who killed
Miss Atwell is Yuri,

1012
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:38,759
therefore Commander Farrell is Yuri.
Quod erat demonstrandum.

1013
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:42,759
You murdered Sam, didn't you?
You're a fucking asshole.

1014
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:51,957
You have no idea
what men of power can do.

1015
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,597
Wait a second.

1016
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:57,678
Scott has been a loyal
and valuable friend.

1017
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:02,999
I let that friendship cloud my judgement.
My actions have been ineXcusable.

1018
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:04,473
Scott.

1019
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,238
Give me the gun.

1020
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,960
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do,

1021
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:16,550
but I swear I'll do everything I can
to help you out. Everything.

1022
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:19,035
I'll get you the best lawyers.

1023
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:24,916
David, he doesn't have a shred of proof.

1024
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,476
Wait.

1025
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:33,393
He was fiercely jealous of Susan.
A man like that... Do you understand?

1026
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:36,717
Suppose we had planned on
working late Sunday night.

1027
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,354
I didn't arrive.
He assumed I was with Susan.

1028
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:43,519
Don't touch me. He went there
looking for me. They argued...

1029
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:45,949
- You can assume the rest.
- Save your breath.

1030
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:49,470
Help me out on this. Help me out.

1031
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,148
Listen, I'll give you anything you want.

1032
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:58,398
I swear, I'll give you anything you want.
Listen to me. Help me out.

1033
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:03,036
I will give you anything you want.
You can have anything you want.

1034
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:06,914
If you go against me on this, it'll be
your word against mine, and I'll win.

1035
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:07,995
David.

1036
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:21,791
What's going on in there?

1037
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,478
Stand back.

1038
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:28,198
Oh, my God. How horrible!

1039
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:31,316
Felson.

1040
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,195
Your search is over, Major.

1041
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:44,275
- Is this...?
- He shot himself.

1042
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,036
Anderson.

1043
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:01,115
Commander, do I have your answer?

1044
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:05,471
Commander, sir. Are you all right, sir?

1045
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:07,477
Give me your pen, Ensign.

1046
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:10,068
You got a pen? Well, give it to me!

1047
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:18,077
I want you to deliver this. And I want you
to wake him up if you have to.

1048
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:22,636
Aye aye, sir.

1049
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,956
Go.

1050
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:39,796
Charlie, come look at this.

1051
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:42,676
Somebody get Donovan down here.

1052
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,756
It's Commander Farrell.

1053
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,996
A lot of people are looking for you.

1054
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,276
Then aren't you the clever ones?

1055
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:48,270
- When's he comin' out?
- When you've made certain things clear.

1056
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:52,393
- Then let's just get to the point.
- Why did we only just hear about this?

1057
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,476
You would've known before!

1058
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:58,074
I told you that I could not
get out of the Pentagon!

1059
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:01,510
All right. But your relationship
with the woman was poorly handled!

1060
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,756
You wanted me to be her lover.
I was her lover.

1061
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:07,555
- I don't see any point in going on.
- Yeah, well, neither do l!

1062
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,037
Yevgeny AleXeyevich...

1063
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:34,234
Wouldn't you love to hear Russian again?
lmagine Pushkin, Lermontov, Tolstoy.

1064
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:37,554
Solzhenitsyn, Aksenov.

1065
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:40,752
Even them. Always the sense of humour.

1066
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:45,556
In the Philippines when you passed a bag
of underwear Moscow wasn't amused.

1067
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:47,636
I should have acted then.

1068
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:51,837
In any case, it's not possible
for you to remain United States.

1069
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:54,520
This bizarre incident
has given them their Yuri.

1070
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:57,350
Yevgeny, think.

1071
01:44:57,480 --> 01:45:00,711
- Think! You're a hero of the Soviet Union.
- I'm not a hero.

1072
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:05,470
- Be that as it may, you must return.
- I came here. I thought I owed you that.

1073
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:08,475
But you can't make me go back.

1074
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:15,597
No.

1075
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:17,756
Let him go.

1076
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:28,036
He will return.
Where else does he have to go?

1077
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:02,915
