00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:10,478
Nice indoors work, huh, Darryl?.
Clean, safe.

158
00:11:10,527 --> 00:11:13,121
You got this clown
in there sellin' ounces?

159
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:14,805
Why him? What's up with me?

160
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:17,315
Cos you like my son, man.

161
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:20,199
Strike, my son.

162
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:23,398
If I'm so much your son, why my black
ass always on them benches?

163
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:26,280
I need you to be
where I need you to be.

164
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:28,477
Had this dream last night.

165
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:31,961
I'm standin' in the desert
with all my kids.

166
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:34,646
My for-real kids,
my kids from the store.

167
00:11:35,287 --> 00:11:38,962
They's all laid out in front
of me like they's my army.

168
00:11:40,327 --> 00:11:42,682
God comes up, points at you.

169
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:48,282
Tells me, "This one right here is
gonna be your sword and your staff."

170
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:51,998
God, man. God said that.

171
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:54,242
He pointed right at you.

172
00:11:55,287 --> 00:11:58,199
Darryl Adams wasn't even in
the motherfuckin' dream,

173
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:01,045
cos that boy's a thief,
and he got to be got.

174
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,521
- "Got"?
- Got.

175
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:08,240
(Strike ) Can't you get Errol
for that shit, man?

176
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:11,324
You know Errol
gave hisself the Big "A".

177
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:13,517
The virus.

178
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:17,280
My man messed around
and took that "A" train.

179
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:20,797
Anyway, can you see Errol in there,

180
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:25,204
sellin' whale on a bun
and ounces and fries?

181
00:12:26,007 --> 00:12:27,725
Nah.

182
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:31,560
Strike, you really want
to get off the benches?

183
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:35,562
You deal with it...

184
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,558
for me.

185
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:50,998

No, we don't got
no damn chocolate Moos.

- This is a bar, son.
- Mooooo.

- What you doin' here, man?

- Yeah.

Yeah, well, I love you, too, Ronnie.

shouldn't have freakin' shot... #

- You know that's Ahab's over there.
- Yeah, the competition.

207
00:14:24,927 --> 00:14:29,478
You know that clown that works
in there? The night manager, Darryl?.

208

- Darryl?. No.
- Darryl Adams.

Yo, the brother is bad peoples.

Now, how is, uh...
How is Darryl Adams bad people?

211
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:44,397
Cos, yo, he beat up
this honey Charise, man.

212
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:48,235
She's only 16, kid.
She came in askin' for a job.

213
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,755
This nigger took her
to the back office,

talkin' 'bout "slob my johnson".

215

And when she said no, he started
slappin' her up and shit.

216
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:58,523
Yo, the brother's foul.

217
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:01,286
- A woman beater.
- Yup.

218
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:03,921
A dope-dealin' woman beater.

219

Man, I don't know about all that.

220

- Who's sayin' all this?
- (Sighs) Yo, man, the shit is real.

00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:11,720
Her moms is mad stressed out
about that shit.

She wants some
motherfuckin' payback, yo.

She wants to see that man dead.

What if it was you, your daughter?
Charise is her only child.

- Come on, man.

Vic, why you fuckin' with me, man?

230
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,797
I'm tryin' to kick
some serious shit here.

231

Should've known I couldn't
come to see you about nothin'.

232
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:44,924
I know somebody.

00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:46,286
Who?

234
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:48,522
- My Man.
- Well, who that?

Look, My Man. A friend of a friend.

- Nothin'.

So what's the deal?.

239
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,201
I'm listenin'.
What you want me to do?

Nothin', man. All right?
Just chill. All right?

241

So my little mans,

Yo, black, we closed.

you don't eat this shit

He's the night manager of this joint.

Kid's standin' by the door having
a conversation with another male.

Pop, pop, poppity-pop.
Darryl goes down.

there's four shots fired.

At this point, that's all she wrote.

- Robbery?
- Nah. Way too fast.

281
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,158
Drugs? Was he a scumbag?

282
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:58,199
To tell you the truth,
I never seen this kid before.

283

Boys, Darryl Adams.
Darryl Adams, the boys.

284

- Hey, Darryl.
- Hello in there.

die by the gun.

- The kid had brains.
- Good thing he was wearin' his gold.

Bing, bing, bing. Ricochet Rabbit.

288

I still think it was the food here.

289
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:22,076
Hal, get in there,
tell me what you got.

290
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:26,443
There she blows.

291
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:28,876
Let's see.
No powder burns on the face.

292
00:19:28,927 --> 00:19:33,364
- These eyes have lied.
- Looking about 30, 35 years old.

293
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:35,637
- Doors one and two.
- OK, let's see.

294
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:37,006
Nothin' up the sleeve.

295
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:39,515
He might get better,
but he ain't never gettin' well.

296
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:41,478
- And presto!
- Hey, slapped him five.

297
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:43,438
On the light hand side.

298
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:47,116
Hey, look at that. Looks like some
kind of an Egyptian peace sign.

299
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:50,079
You're right there. It says goodbye.

300
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:53,039
Hey, Moe. My main man.
Gonna need prints off that door.

301
00:19:53,087 --> 00:19:55,760
Fuck you, Rocco.
That'll really narrow it down(!)

302
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:58,241
We'll get half the yos
in Brooklyn off this door.

303
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:00,721
- What, did you eat at Ahab's Burger?
- Yeah.

304
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,917
- You owe me six more.
- I love my job, too.

305
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:04,446
More prints than my ex-wife.

306
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:07,126
- He wearing any?
- Be with you in a second.

307
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:09,840
Must be his golf jacket.
It's got 18 holes.

308
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:12,204
Oh, Christ!

309
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:14,721
What the fuck did he eat?

00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:16,837
# Come out, come out,
wherever you are

311
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:19,082
# The monkey's on the trolley car #

312
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:22,437
Looks like they did come out.
Here's one. Two. Two exits.

313
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,045
What's the grapevine say?

314
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:27,363
What they always say.
"We keep our ear to the grindstone."

315
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:29,716
- Was he clockin'?
- I don't know.

316
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:31,803
- Hal, how ya doin'?
- How ya doin', Lar.

317
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:33,758
- Check the pockets.
- Yeah.

318
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:36,321
Son of a bitch! That's Darryl Adams!

319
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:37,482
(Rocco ) Who?

320
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,087
He worked in Rodney's candy store.
I saw him a lot.

321
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:42,436
If he worked for Rodney,
he was clockin'.

322
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:45,524
- Hal, check the pockets again.
- Sure. Hold on.

323
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:47,683
- Nothin'.
- What's up, Darryl?.

324
00:20:49,447 --> 00:20:52,837
Clockin' like a motherfucker, man.

325
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:54,883
(Man) You guys done yet?

326
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:57,566
Ho! Marvello the magician!

327
00:20:57,607 --> 00:21:00,519
- Catch a bullet with his teeth.
- (Rocco ) What a catch!

328
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:03,718
- What a smile.
- Darryl, you've outdone Willie Mays.

329
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:05,325
You got my vote for MVP.

330
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:08,040
Another stain on the sidewalk, huh?

331
00:21:09,927 --> 00:21:12,487
(Detective ) Get a pail and a mop.
Get it over with.

332
00:21:12,527 --> 00:21:13,642
One, two, three.

333
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:18,126
Arrivederci!

334
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:22,080
All right. Show's over!
Officers, send 'em home!

335
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:23,845
- See ya, Hal.
- Take care.

336
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:27,277
Yo, Moe, don't make me have to come
back for those fuckin' prints!

337
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,761
- What you cursin' about?
- I'm sorry.

338
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:34,604
Beep beep.

339
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:37,957
Excuse me.

340
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:40,077
All right. I won't do it gain.

341
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:42,118
(Man) I'm outta here, man.

342
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:53,284
- Got 50 bucks?
- Nah, man.

343
00:21:53,727 --> 00:21:56,002
Well, all I find, all I keep.

344
00:21:59,447 --> 00:22:01,961
Don't be lookin' at me
in the eye, nigger.

345
00:22:02,007 --> 00:22:05,283
Your ass will be on this mural, too.
I know that look.

346
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:09,764
See, you wonderin' how
I got that AIDS, ain't ya?

347
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:13,243
- Nah, man.
- You a lyin' motherfucker!

348
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:16,006
It wasn't from fuckin'
with them punks.

349
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:18,197
I ain't no homosexual.

350
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:21,045
No, man, I ain't say
all that, all right?

351
00:22:21,087 --> 00:22:23,442
Fuckin' with this shit.

352
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:28,877
I can't believe I got this shit.

353
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:33,079
All this time
in these motherfuckin' streets!

354
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:36,005
And I'm a smart motherfucker.

355
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:39,885
I know I should've
left that shit alone.

356
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:43,925
One time I was studyin'
to be an accountant.

357
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:50,118
Now this shit is fuckin' my body up.
I have a goddam death sentence.

358
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:55,121
That's why I don't
give a shit about nobody.

359
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,761
And I don't wanna
see your ass no more!

360
00:22:58,567 --> 00:23:02,526
Cos you ain't got no business
out here fuckin' with this shit.

361
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:05,764
You'll end up like me. Or worse.

362
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:08,959
My old man...

363
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:11,202
was a preacher.

364
00:23:13,687 --> 00:23:17,362
And when I started messin'
with this shit,

365
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:21,477
he said, "You gonna pay for that.

366
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:26,120
"You gonna pay for that shit, boy."

367
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:30,926
He was right.

368
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:35,836
You can't cheat this shit no...mo'.

369
00:23:35,887 --> 00:23:37,878
Get the fuck outta here!

370
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,965
Why you wanna be
always arguin' with me?

371
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:46,999
No, wait. Listen to me.
How many pair sneakers you got?

372
00:23:47,047 --> 00:23:49,322
- The pair I got on makes six.
- Yo, Rodney.

373
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:52,564
- Wait a second. Six, right?
- Yeah.

374
00:23:52,607 --> 00:23:56,077
- How many pair o' feet you got?
- Two, like everybody else.

375
00:23:56,127 --> 00:23:58,641
He don't see what I'm talkin' about.

376
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,757
- You don't, do you?
- What, man?

377
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:04,516
How you gonna make ten and spend ten,
nigger? Ten minus ten make what?

378
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:06,683
- Zero.
- You wanna be a zero nigger?

379
00:24:06,727 --> 00:24:09,195
- I don't want me no zero nigger.
- You ain't got one.

380
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,807
Right. Now you see
what I'm sayin' to you?

381
00:24:11,847 --> 00:24:14,236
Nigger wanna spend
all his money like that

382
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,596
gonna wake up broke
every day of his life.

383
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:20,003
Why? Cos the nigger
don't believe in hisself.

384
00:24:20,047 --> 00:24:23,244
Thinkin' like a two-minute clock
instead of the long haul.

385
00:24:23,287 --> 00:24:24,925
Long term. See your future.

386
00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:28,118
Y'all come work for me,
this shit gonna be very different.

387
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,805
You gonna be savin' crazy money.

388
00:24:29,847 --> 00:24:33,476
You gonna buy your moms
a house in Strong Island. Right?

389
00:24:39,087 --> 00:24:42,363
Everybody stick out your hands
like this, palm down.

390
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:46,481
- What you all see?
- (All) Black.

391
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:49,246
- What you see?
- You 'posed to be seein' green.

392
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,323
All right. You get it, man?

393
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:53,483
No. You get it, nigger? You get it?

394
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:54,755
- I got it.
- All right.

395
00:24:54,807 --> 00:24:56,877
(All talk at once )

396
00:24:58,527 --> 00:24:59,801
Excuse me. Excuse me.

397
00:24:59,847 --> 00:25:02,600
- You all have a job to do inside?
- Yeah.

398
00:25:02,647 --> 00:25:06,037
Well, let's go. Who trash?

399
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:15,165
What's the matter with you?

400
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:17,721
Man, you ain't heard what happened?

401
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,122
I ain't heard nothin'.

402
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:23,284
You told me if I wanted
to get off them benches...

403
00:25:23,327 --> 00:25:24,601
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

404
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:28,526
All's I hear is that Ahab's
lookin' for a new night manager.

405
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:30,080
I heard that.

406
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:36,116
Look here. You gonna chill
for a week or two, right?

407
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:39,876
Let the shit die down.
Be workin' still at my spot.

408
00:25:39,927 --> 00:25:43,363
You gonna be on the benches,
but Ahab is the joint.

409
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:46,763
I'm tellin' you.
I got it. I'm all right.

410
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:50,558
Nigger look bad, boy.

411
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:55,520
What we're gonna do, we're gonna mix
the shit up with the food traffic.

412
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:59,845
Right? See, right now, we're doin'
way too much business from my spot.

413
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:01,843
We got a crowd of black,
white customers,

414
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:04,481
out-of-state license plates,
what have you.

415
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:09,317
Somebody gonna check that out. They
gonna drop a dime on me, call 911.

416
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:12,040
With my jacket,
I can't go back to jail.

417
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:15,397
Ahab gonna be a nice front.
You did good, Strike.

418
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:16,846
You did good.

419
00:26:16,887 --> 00:26:21,119
Now why you lookin' like that?
Somethin' wrong?

420
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:22,964
Huh?

421
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:27,880
You know it's me and you, right?

422
00:26:27,927 --> 00:26:31,078
What I tell you?
You like my son, right?

423
00:26:31,127 --> 00:26:34,244
I'm gonna look out for you. Right?

424
00:26:34,287 --> 00:26:36,926
- I ain't let you down yet, have I?
- Nah.

425
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:38,525
OK, then.

426
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:41,639
Come in here. I'm gonna get
somethin' to eat for you.

427
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:43,484
Come on.

428
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,481
Strike. What's up with
that train set you got?

429
00:26:49,527 --> 00:26:52,087
- It's all right.
- Fuckin' Choo-Choo Charlie.

430
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:54,880
You readin' a train book? Choo-choo!

431
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:58,397
Every man should have a hobby.
What's yours? Collectin' welfare?

432
00:26:58,447 --> 00:27:02,520
That shit ain't funny, man. Word up.
Why you tryin' to play me, Strike?

433
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:04,762
I don't talk about them...
Fuck that, man!

434
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:07,480
I don't talk about them toys
inside your crib.

435
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:10,246
Yeah, I know, cos I'll
bust your motherfuckin' ass.

436
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:14,807
Yo, Shorty, what you laughin' at?

437
00:27:17,647 --> 00:27:21,162
- One time says freeze!
- Fuck!

438
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:23,038
(Muttering)

439
00:27:23,847 --> 00:27:26,122
Hey, little man. Stay right there.

440
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:29,603
Stand up, mastermind.

441
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:36,716
Hmm. Oh. Is that Rodney?

442
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:38,997
- Rodney rang?
- You oughtta know.

443
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:43,004
- Y'all hear that noise about Darryl?.
- Yeah, man.

444
00:27:43,047 --> 00:27:46,278
Yeah, well, I had to tell
his moms and pops last night.

445
00:27:46,327 --> 00:27:48,716
That ain't no joke. I hate it.

446
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,246
Rough.

447
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:53,518
I just hope I never have to notify
none of your parents.

448
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:55,558
Leave this shit alone!

449
00:27:58,127 --> 00:28:01,005
- How them trains comin'?
- (Laughter)

450
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:06,082
Little man, come here. Come here.

451
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:12,599
What'd I tell you about bein' around
these knuckleheads? Huh?

452
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:16,959
Now, I'm watchin' you.
Go on upstairs.

453
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:20,761
Yo, Andre. Why don't you go chase
some criminals or somethin'?

454
00:28:33,207 --> 00:28:35,596
Yo, Shorty. What you lookin' at?

455
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:39,003
Yo, come here, man.
Yeah, you. Come here.

456
00:28:39,047 --> 00:28:41,925
Come on. Hurry up.
Quick. Time is money.

457
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:45,484
Come here.

458
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:49,799
God damn, Shorty!
This is some nappy shit.

459
00:28:49,847 --> 00:28:52,566
When the last time you been
in a barber shop?

460
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:53,756
I don't know.

461
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,478
'Put your hands up.'

462
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:03,997
(Shorty ) Ding-ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding!

463
00:29:04,047 --> 00:29:05,765
Watch out. Flip. Shoot.

464
00:29:05,807 --> 00:29:08,196
(Imitating machine gun)

465
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,475
Yo.

466
00:29:09,527 --> 00:29:13,486
Watch out! Duck! Now what? Come on.
Throw us somethin' else.

467
00:29:13,527 --> 00:29:14,642
Yo!

468
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,996
- Where you manners at?
- Thanks.

469
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,436
- What's your name, Shorty?
- Tyrone Jeeter.

470
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:21,796
All right. Shorty.

471
00:29:22,607 --> 00:29:26,282
(Strike ) Yo, there goes
my brother, Victor. Shit.

472
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:28,204
- Wait here, all right?
- All right.

473
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:30,238
Be right back.

474
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:37,559
Vic!

475
00:29:44,927 --> 00:29:46,724
(Indistinct)

476
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:03,480
Uh! Watch out! Oh, man!

477
00:30:03,527 --> 00:30:05,916
Uh! Uh! Flip!

478
00:30:22,407 --> 00:30:25,524
- Who did this? Huh? Who did this?
- ?Qué?

479
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:28,923
Who did this? Who did this?
Who did this?

480
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:31,527
Who did this? Who did this?

481
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:35,082
Who's tryin' to be my son's daddy
and gave him this haircut?

482
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:38,961
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

483
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:42,477
Nobody don't know
nothin' now, huh?

484
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:44,916
Yo no se nada.

485
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:48,596
I know you. I know you.

486
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:51,286
Cedric Stanley Gilmore.

487
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:53,636
(Others laugh)

488
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:56,645
And I know you, too. Ronnie Dunham.

489
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:58,120
Shit.

490
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,727
You used to live
next door to me, remember?

491
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:05,238
I know your mother. Gloria.

492
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:11,442
You all ain't nothin' but a bunch of
good-for-nothin', death-dealin' scum.

493
00:31:11,487 --> 00:31:14,365
I find out who's been
messin' with Tyrone,

494
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:18,798
I'm gonna put a bullet
in your butt my own damn self.

495
00:31:18,847 --> 00:31:21,520
Don't let me find Andre either.

496
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:26,037
Have a good Sunday.

497
00:31:31,207 --> 00:31:34,404
Shit. I know that bitch
ain't talkin' to me.

498
00:31:34,447 --> 00:31:36,358
- Scientific, man, shut up.
- You shut up, man.

499
00:31:38,927 --> 00:31:46,003
OK, Victor? Ready to go?

500
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:52,877
Normally I'd cuff you, brother,

501
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:55,521
but you look like
the kind of guy I can trust.

502
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:02,358
Like I said.
I had some drinks at Kool Breeze.

503
00:32:02,407 --> 00:32:05,046
- Uh, Scotch.
- "Some"?

504
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:07,362
Like two or three.

505
00:32:07,407 --> 00:32:10,524
I usually go in there
after most work nights.

506
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:13,525
Uh-huh. How long were you in there?

507
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:17,321
Uh, I don't know.
About eight-thirty till about ten.

508
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:20,518
Uh, see... My shift...at Hambones -

509
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:22,876
I'm a...I'm a manager.

510
00:32:23,887 --> 00:32:25,684
It don't end till ten.

511
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:28,560
I wasn't feelin' very good,
so I left early.

512
00:32:29,927 --> 00:32:33,078
You weren't feelin' good,
so you went to Kool Breeze?

513
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:38,796
It wasn't like it was a "goin' home"
not feelin' good.

514
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:41,361
You had a headache? An argument?

515
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:44,486
(Sighs)

516
00:32:45,687 --> 00:32:47,882
No, I just...just tired, man.

517
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:50,800
Go ahead.

518
00:32:50,847 --> 00:32:54,726
So I left Kool Breeze,
uh, started walkin' home.

519
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:57,235
I cut through Ahab's parking lot.

520
00:32:57,287 --> 00:33:00,757
And this guy just flexed on me, man.
He jumped outta nowhere.

521
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:03,526
I got scared. You know the rest.

522
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:05,558
Tell me, Victor.

523
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:09,478
I just... I shot him.

524
00:33:10,927 --> 00:33:13,521
Hey, little man.
I like that cut.

525
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:16,161
- Where'd you get it?
- Barber shop.

526
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:27,081
You know, you used to have
a good head on your shoulders

527
00:33:27,127 --> 00:33:29,083
before Rodney got a hold of you.

528
00:33:29,127 --> 00:33:31,357
Still do.

529
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:36,276
You know, Ronald, I been lookin' out
for you since you been yea high.

530
00:33:36,327 --> 00:33:40,115
Now, you don't want my guidance?
Fine. It's your life.

531
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:42,158
Let me tell you somethin'.

532
00:33:42,207 --> 00:33:45,802
You even glance in the direction
of that little kid Tyrone,

533
00:33:45,847 --> 00:33:49,442
and I'm gonna fuck you up so bad
you're gonna wish I had killed you.

534
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:52,206
Now, do we have an understanding?

535
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:55,080
Do we have an understanding?

536
00:33:55,127 --> 00:33:57,687
(Sighs) Yeah.

537
00:33:57,727 --> 00:34:00,605
Why do we keep goin' through this?
I told you already.

538
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:05,357
The guy jumped outta nowhere, I
got scared... Bam! Then I ran. I ran!

539
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:07,125
You mean bam, bam, bam, bam.

540
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:10,125
- What?
- Four bullets in the body.

541
00:34:11,207 --> 00:34:14,244
- Where did you carry the gun?
- In my gym bag.

542
00:34:15,327 --> 00:34:16,919
What else you carry in it?

543
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:18,559
(Sighs)

544
00:34:18,607 --> 00:34:22,202
My uniform from Hambones,
a sandwich from home.

545
00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:24,841
I don't eat Hambones myself,
as quiet as it's kept.

546
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:28,926
OK. Was the, uh,
gym bag zippered, locked?

547
00:34:30,647 --> 00:34:32,638
Don't shake your head, Victor.

548
00:34:32,687 --> 00:34:35,042
- (Andre ) Where's my mattresses?
- What?

549
00:34:35,087 --> 00:34:37,647
I told you about my mattresses
for them kids.

550
00:34:37,687 --> 00:34:41,965
They ask, "You say we gonna have
a tumblin' club. We need mattresses."

551
00:34:42,007 --> 00:34:46,080
And I say, "Well, Strike's
buyin' 'em. He promised."

552
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:48,357
Now, look, I ain't busted you yet,

553
00:34:48,407 --> 00:34:52,241
but till I do,
you gonna be my main benefactor.

554
00:34:52,287 --> 00:34:55,165
You gonna sponsor this club,
you understand me?

555
00:34:55,207 --> 00:34:59,041
And, Ronald, I'm only tellin'
you one more time, you hear?

556
00:35:00,087 --> 00:35:02,885
The store was closed.
One of them Jewish holidays.

557
00:35:02,927 --> 00:35:06,203
- What Jewish holiday?
- I don't know. Pick one.

558
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:09,683
Tomorrow, all right?
I swear, I'll swing by tomorrow.

559
00:35:09,727 --> 00:35:12,525
Andre, these cuffs is too tight, man.

560
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:14,444
You and me used to be tight.

561
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:18,958
(Strike ) Am I under arrest?
(Andre ) What for?

562
00:35:20,007 --> 00:35:23,238
Could you uncuff me, please,
and let me outta here?

563
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,562
You don't have to live like this.

564
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:30,403
There's more than just these projects
out there, you know.

565
00:35:30,447 --> 00:35:32,961
Don't you wanna go someplace
you never been?

566
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:36,556
I mean, you love trains,
but you've only ridden the subway.

567
00:35:40,247 --> 00:35:42,158
Go on, man. Get outta here.

568
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,846
And get them mattresses
for my kids, hear?

569
00:35:45,807 --> 00:35:48,844
- Never.
- (Rocco ) Never?

570
00:35:48,887 --> 00:35:51,879
You never walked by
on a hot day with your two kids?

571
00:35:51,927 --> 00:35:54,487
- Stopped in for a soda?
- With my two kids?

572
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,166
I barely see my two kids.
I'm always working.

573
00:35:57,207 --> 00:35:59,721
When I get home, I'm exhausted.

574
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:01,405
Do you have any kids?

575
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:04,245
(Rocco ) Yeah. I have
a two-year-old daughter.

576
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:08,044
Have you ever come home so tired

577
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:11,602
you hated the sound
of your own kids cryin'?

578
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:14,842
Your own flesh and blood.

579
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:18,640
My wife, Sharon, says,
"Quit a job. You got two."

580
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:22,157
What the hell she thinks I got
two jobs for in the first place?

581
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:24,516
Look, I'm...I'm tryin', man.

582
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:27,604
I am really tryin'
to move us out of the projects.

583
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:29,444
You know what I'm sayin'?

584
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:33,799
I'm working, I'm saving,
I'm trying to do the best I can.

585
00:36:34,847 --> 00:36:37,600
Provide those ends. I gotta work.

586
00:36:38,607 --> 00:36:41,405
I'm never late. I gotta work.

587
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:44,884
Victor, listen to me.

588
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:48,923
You're a good, decent,
church-goin', God-fearin' kid.

589
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:51,003
And if you did pull the trigger,

590
00:36:51,047 --> 00:36:55,643
there has to be a reasonable answer
other than what you've told me here.

591
00:36:55,687 --> 00:36:59,680
I gotta ask myself, why would Darryl,
the night manager at Ahab's,

592
00:36:59,727 --> 00:37:02,195
try to rob you
in his own parking lot?

593
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:06,242
So I think it had to be personal.

594
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:10,200
Mm-mm. No.
I never saw him before in my life.

595
00:37:10,247 --> 00:37:12,920
- He flexed, you shot?
- I'm through with it.

596
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:15,959
I told you what happened.
What else do you want?

597
00:37:16,007 --> 00:37:18,237
- The truth.
- The truth is lookin' at you!

598
00:37:18,287 --> 00:37:22,883
If he did something, if he threatened
your family, this helps you.

599
00:37:22,927 --> 00:37:27,557
You were buggin' - "can't sleep,
can't eat". This helps you in court.

600
00:37:27,607 --> 00:37:30,405
What did that prick do to you?

601
00:37:34,527 --> 00:37:36,836
(Sighs) It was self-defence.

602
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:41,241
(Sighs) Self-defence, huh?

603
00:37:44,527 --> 00:37:46,563
I wanna see what you see.

604
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:50,286
Uh. I disagree.

605
00:37:50,327 --> 00:37:53,444
I don't think I do look
that fuckin' stupid.

606
00:37:58,047 --> 00:38:00,515
Dang, man. In the papers.

607
00:38:00,567 --> 00:38:03,240
I thought Vic was legit.
What happened?

608
00:38:03,287 --> 00:38:05,403
Boy already had like five jobs.

609
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:09,766
Ooh-ooh!

610
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:13,516
Aw, shit, man! What the fuck
the homo-cide want now?

611
00:38:18,887 --> 00:38:23,085
(Detective ) 235 Hoyt,
Mandela projects, all right?

612
00:38:23,127 --> 00:38:25,516
- Yo, Tyrone.
- What's up?

613
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:28,525
Come over here and watch
the car for me, all right?

614
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:31,365
- All right?
- Yeah, cool. What you gonna give us?

615
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:33,204
(Rocco ) Catch you in a little bit.

616
00:38:33,247 --> 00:38:35,238
(Tyrone ) We ain't gonna do it
for free.

617
00:38:35,287 --> 00:38:37,437
(Detective ) I'll take care
of you later.

618
00:38:37,487 --> 00:38:39,603
(Tyrone chattering, indistinct)

619
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:43,646
Excuse me, sir.
Which building is 235 Hoyt?

620
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:45,882
- Right there.
- Thank you.

621
00:39:04,207 --> 00:39:06,641
(Panting)

622
00:39:07,047 --> 00:39:08,844
Is that Nintendo or Sega?

623
00:39:08,887 --> 00:39:10,878
- Sega.
- What's it called?

624
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:13,919
- "Gangsta."
- Whatever happened to Tiddlywinks?

625
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:18,203
Rocco, don't you know this is
the new sensation across the nation?

626
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:21,956
- Where you goin'?
- My friend's house.

627
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,799
Everybody wants
to be a gangsta, right?

628
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:30,521
Yeah, you like that, right?
You like lookin' at that, right?

629
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:33,035
- Wanna know how much it costs.
- I know that.

630
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:37,205
Yeah, I'm sure.
Probably want to buy one, right?

631
00:39:37,247 --> 00:39:39,442
How you know I don't got one?

632
00:39:40,487 --> 00:39:42,842
- Why did he have that gun?
- Everybody has one.

633
00:39:42,887 --> 00:39:45,321
- Does he drink a lot?
- He only drank at night.

634
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:47,437
That makes two of us.

635
00:39:48,047 --> 00:39:51,357
- How about drugs?
- He's clean as the Board of Health.

636
00:39:51,407 --> 00:39:54,126
Did he have
any new friends recently?

637
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:57,204
- Hangin' out with any new people?
- Not that I know of.

638
00:39:57,247 --> 00:40:01,240
You must be thinking of Ronald,
but he hasn't lived here in a while.

639
00:40:01,287 --> 00:40:03,403
- He's quite the athlete.
- Yes.

640
00:40:03,447 --> 00:40:06,325
- You boys must be proud of your dad.
- (Both) Yes.

641
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:08,358
I'll bet. Something's not right.

642
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:11,319
When I'm workin' on something,
I gotta make it right.

643
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:15,406
These are my two sons,
Victor and Ronald.

644
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:19,520
Victor's a hard-working,
handsome young man.

645
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:23,640
He doesn't lie. If he said it was
self-defence, it was self-defence.

646
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,325
Why don't you believe him?

647
00:40:25,367 --> 00:40:27,881
(Rocco ) Do you mind
if I borrow these?

648
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:31,442
I have to go around and retrace
his steps the other night,

649
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:33,955
- and I'd rather not show a mug shot.
- Sure.

650
00:40:34,007 --> 00:40:36,680
(Rocco ) You be good boys.
Take care of your mother.

651
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:39,480
- Strike.
- You know him?

652
00:40:39,927 --> 00:40:41,565
He's an arrogant piece of shit.

653
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:44,485
Comes into my store all the time
like he craps beige.

654
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:48,964
He used to work with Rodney
last year in his store, with Darryl.

655
00:40:49,007 --> 00:40:50,998
Now he runs the crew on the benches.

656
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:53,925
Clocks for Rodney just like Darryl.
Let's bring him in.

657
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:56,527
- What up, man?
- They went to the ninth floor.

658
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:58,717
Shit! I knew it.

659
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:02,404
- Did they say anything?
- Asked me about "Gangsta".

660
00:41:02,447 --> 00:41:04,438
- Anything else?
- Nah.

661
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:06,955
(Sighs) All right, Shorty.
You did good, man.

662
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:09,646
Go upstairs before your mom
come down flippin'.

663
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:11,279
All right.

664
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:14,317
Go on upstairs.

665
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:17,483
- Who you hidin' from?
- Come on, man.

666
00:41:17,527 --> 00:41:19,199
What you sneakin' up on me for?

667
00:41:19,247 --> 00:41:21,761
I'm not gonna keep tellin' you
to leave him be.

668
00:41:21,807 --> 00:41:24,162
- Tell him!
- How you feel about your brother?

669
00:41:24,207 --> 00:41:26,198
It's fucked up, man.

670
00:41:27,207 --> 00:41:29,721
I heard he confessed.
You been to see him?

671
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:31,325
I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

672
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:34,643
You need to have your stomach
checked out.

673
00:41:34,687 --> 00:41:37,884
By the way, my kids thank you
from the bottom of their hearts

674
00:41:37,927 --> 00:41:39,838
for their mattresses.

675
00:41:39,887 --> 00:41:42,765
Now doesn't that make you feel good?

676
00:41:45,367 --> 00:41:46,880
(Rocco ) You know this kid?

677
00:41:49,887 --> 00:41:53,402
- Yep. He was in here.
- When?

678
00:41:53,447 --> 00:41:56,245
Boy was in here Friday.
He had one drink.

679
00:41:56,287 --> 00:41:59,324
- One drink? Wasn't drunk?
- Nope.

680
00:41:59,367 --> 00:42:02,723
- He was rude.
- (Bartender) Yeah.

681
00:42:04,247 --> 00:42:08,559
'Ooh! I'm just gettin' warmed up.
But it's The Bomb.'

682
00:42:08,607 --> 00:42:10,882
Was he with anybody?

683
00:42:10,927 --> 00:42:14,522
He came in alone.
Might've had a conversation.

684
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:16,842
Can't recollect.

685
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,082
Do you recollect the shooting?

686
00:42:20,127 --> 00:42:22,561
Hell, yeah.
Who do you think called the cops?

687
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:24,643
So that's who you're lookin' for?

688
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:28,123
Do you remember if the kid was here
before or after the shooting?

689
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:30,362
He was in here before.
You know how I know?

690
00:42:30,407 --> 00:42:33,956
Cos I was watchin' him.
I never saw him before. He was jumpy.

691
00:42:34,007 --> 00:42:36,999
Thought he might have been
one of those stick-up kids.

692
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:44,077
This is Strike. Jesus Christ.

693
00:42:47,327 --> 00:42:50,319
(Man) They don't look alike to me.

694
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,119
What about him?

695
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:56,762
Oh, yeah. Victor? A regular.
What's up with him?

696
00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:04,882
Strike, how come you didn't tell me
your brother did it?

697
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:07,395
Come on, Rodney, man.
What, you forgot?

698
00:43:07,447 --> 00:43:10,996
- You told me you didn't wanna know.
- Yeah, you right.

699
00:43:12,647 --> 00:43:15,480
Victor popped Darryl?.

700
00:43:15,527 --> 00:43:17,961
Hey, I don't know if he even did it.

701
00:43:18,007 --> 00:43:20,567
Victor your brother.
You supposed to know.

702
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:22,882
Errol, Errol, just...

703
00:43:26,207 --> 00:43:29,438
We ain't had that conversation
about Darryl, did we?

704
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:31,000
What conversation?

705
00:43:31,047 --> 00:43:34,119
There, you see? Ain't no problem.

706
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:35,759
Go ahead, man. Break.

707
00:43:43,047 --> 00:43:44,844
That's my boy!

708
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:49,835
(Rocco ) Came in one night only,
on the night of the shooting.

709
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:54,278
Has the jumps. Never sat down.
Left sober before the shooting.

710
00:43:55,287 --> 00:43:58,563
Yo's jacket shows
possession with intent,

711
00:43:58,607 --> 00:44:00,837
possession of unlicensed firearm,

712
00:44:00,887 --> 00:44:04,004
and assault, for which
he still owes three years.

713
00:44:05,007 --> 00:44:07,885
(Larry ) Listen to me, Rocco.
He's all strung out.

714
00:44:07,927 --> 00:44:09,645
Has a few schnorts over his limit.

715
00:44:09,687 --> 00:44:13,282
He gets fried, walks out of Kool
Breeze with the heater in his bag.

716
00:44:13,327 --> 00:44:15,522
The Adams guy jumps out,
startles him.

717
00:44:15,567 --> 00:44:17,842
Pops the first guy
who steps on his Nikes.

718
00:44:17,887 --> 00:44:19,684
It's like a capper on a bad day.

719
00:44:19,727 --> 00:44:23,481
That's how these Nubians do it. He
gets religion, comes in, gives it up.

720
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,563
I'm not wasting my time on this.

721
00:44:25,607 --> 00:44:29,441
(Rocco ) Come on, Larry. Can't you see
what they're tryin' to pull?.

722
00:44:29,487 --> 00:44:32,763
Larry. Yo walks in,
says he's the shooter.

723
00:44:32,807 --> 00:44:35,605
No record,
two adorable kids, two jobs.

724
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:37,956
Model citizen. Claims self-defence.

725
00:44:38,007 --> 00:44:40,726
- OK. All right.
- Who's gonna argue?

726
00:44:40,767 --> 00:44:44,043
Now, this other one...Strike.

727
00:44:44,087 --> 00:44:48,046
If he tried that, they'd throw
the key away. He's a known scumbag.

728
00:44:48,087 --> 00:44:51,238
No wonder this sounds like horseshit.
He's lying.

729
00:44:51,287 --> 00:44:53,198
Victor never got off that bar stool.

730
00:44:53,247 --> 00:44:55,841
- Yo was taken away for his brother.
- For what?

731
00:44:55,887 --> 00:44:58,879
Brotherly love?
Fear? For money? What?

732
00:44:58,927 --> 00:45:01,236
They ran a game on me, these two,

733
00:45:01,287 --> 00:45:03,801
cos this cocksucker
is an innocent man.

734
00:45:03,847 --> 00:45:06,520
Just because a Nubian -
excuse me, Lieutenant -

735
00:45:06,567 --> 00:45:09,559
got a wife, a job, kids,
a dog and a bank account,

736
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:11,006
he can't be a shooter?

737
00:45:11,047 --> 00:45:14,039
You did everything but stick
your tongue down his throat.

738
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:16,806
The kid didn't budge.
Rocco, listen to me.

739
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:20,522
Even if this Victor kid is sellin' us
a line of shit on the tape...

740
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:24,321
which is what they all do anyhow,
even if they're givin' it up...

741
00:45:24,367 --> 00:45:27,643
this is still a good,
solid "closed by arrest".

742
00:45:27,687 --> 00:45:31,316
And if I'm wrong, and Rodney
conspired in on this, or Strike...

743
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:35,599
or the fuckin' Medellin cartel,
I don't give a fuck.

744
00:45:35,647 --> 00:45:37,126
Cos we got the shooter.

745
00:45:38,727 --> 00:45:41,161
We locked up the wrong brother.

746
00:45:41,207 --> 00:45:45,086
The wrong brother. Yeah. Yeah.
Well, it's on you, OK?

747
00:45:47,447 --> 00:45:51,645
What I want to know is where the fuck
did these yos get balls big enough

748
00:45:51,687 --> 00:45:54,247
to think that they could
put this one past me?

749
00:45:54,287 --> 00:45:58,519
I'm tired of hearin' that "yo" shit
from you. Back off.

750
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:00,637
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. Excuse me.
I don't mean any offence.

751
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:05,715
Anybody can bust off an oowop.
What makes Vic any different?

752
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:07,962
Come on, man.
Papers say he had a .38.

753
00:46:08,007 --> 00:46:11,238
- Regardless what the papers say.
- Wait, motherfucker.

754
00:46:11,287 --> 00:46:14,245
When was the last time
you bust off an oowop?

755
00:46:14,287 --> 00:46:18,246
I never murdered nobody,
but I'm gonna murder someone now!

756
00:46:18,287 --> 00:46:22,405
Yo, yo, chill. Hold it, man. Kill
that noise. Homo-cide creepin' up.

757
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,324
How you doin', fellas?

758
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:28,086
Look who's here.
Ronnie Dunham, big man.

759
00:46:28,127 --> 00:46:31,358
- Ronnie?
- Can I talk to you a minute?

760
00:46:33,567 --> 00:46:35,398
Go on, bitch.

761
00:46:37,247 --> 00:46:39,886
I'm Rocco Klein,
DA's Homicide Squad.

762
00:46:40,647 --> 00:46:42,763
- You got a minute?
- Homo-cide.

763
00:46:42,807 --> 00:46:46,516
I'm doin' the Darryl Adams job.
Your brother, you know?

764
00:46:46,567 --> 00:46:47,966
How's he doin'?

765
00:46:48,007 --> 00:46:50,567
Wouldn't know. Haven't seen him yet.

766
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:55,117
That's no joke in there.
You been in?

767
00:46:56,287 --> 00:46:59,085
Just overnight on a confusion.
Wasn't no thing.

768
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,360
Errol. I thought you were dead.

769
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:09,365
I was. I came back.

770
00:47:09,407 --> 00:47:11,318
Mr Barnes waiting for you?

771
00:47:11,367 --> 00:47:13,483
Nah, not me.

772
00:47:15,127 --> 00:47:17,083
I'm not happy about this.

773
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:21,120
Your brother fessed up,
but it was some bullshit explanation.

774
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:23,203
Ronnie, you know what he told us?

775
00:47:23,247 --> 00:47:26,000
How the fuck would I know?
I wasn't there.

776
00:47:26,047 --> 00:47:30,802
- Wasn't there?
- Where he was telling you all this.

777
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,963
What do you think happened?

778
00:47:34,007 --> 00:47:35,804
Got me.

779
00:47:36,407 --> 00:47:40,320
You think him and Darryl
had some static? A beef?

780
00:47:40,367 --> 00:47:43,120
- Did you know Darryl Adams?
- No, no, no.

781
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:45,840
- You didn't know Darryl Adams?
- Nah, man.

782
00:47:45,887 --> 00:47:49,482
I never met him, nothin'. Nah.

783
00:47:49,527 --> 00:47:52,246
When's the last time
you saw your brother?

784
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:55,040
- It's been a while.
- Week, month, year?

785
00:47:55,087 --> 00:47:57,043
- Yeah.
- Which one?

786
00:47:57,087 --> 00:47:59,123
Two months.

787
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,158
(Rocco ) Two months?

788
00:48:01,207 --> 00:48:02,720
(Beeper)

789
00:48:02,767 --> 00:48:04,166
You wanna get that?

790
00:48:04,207 --> 00:48:07,483
What you talkin'? That ain't mine.

791
00:48:07,527 --> 00:48:09,324
What do you know?

792
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,720
Ronnie, I was lookin' for
some help, some insight.

793
00:48:12,767 --> 00:48:15,235
Your brother's got those kids,
your nephews.

794
00:48:15,287 --> 00:48:17,243
Hey, maybe the guy was a crackhead.

795
00:48:17,287 --> 00:48:20,404
Darryl?. A crackhead?
Crackin' up? Says who?

796
00:48:21,727 --> 00:48:25,197
Ain't nobody sa... It's just...
It's just around, you know.

797
00:48:25,247 --> 00:48:27,283
You know what I'm tryin' to say.

798
00:48:27,327 --> 00:48:29,522
- You clocking?
- Nah.

799
00:48:30,527 --> 00:48:34,122
- How long you been clocking?
- What is you? Deaf? I don't hustle.

800
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:37,159
Look. Here's my card.

801
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:40,882
You hear anything...
boom - pick up the phone.

802
00:48:40,927 --> 00:48:43,316
- Boom.
- Good.

803
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:45,756
I'll be seein' ya around, Ronnie.

804
00:48:51,647 --> 00:48:54,002
# Cos I wouldn't do this

805
00:48:54,047 --> 00:48:55,799
# Lord, if I tried... #

806
00:48:55,847 --> 00:48:58,520
(Car door closes, engine starts)

807
00:48:58,567 --> 00:49:02,640
- What he want?
- Somethin' about my brother.

808
00:49:08,167 --> 00:49:10,044
This is from Rodney.

809
00:49:11,927 --> 00:49:14,885
He say whack it up...
into ounces.

810
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:20,161
He'll hit you off...later.

811
00:49:21,087 --> 00:49:23,237
Yeah, all right.

812
00:49:24,247 --> 00:49:25,600
Hm.

813
00:49:31,207 --> 00:49:33,243
- Jo-Jo. You know Rodney Little?
- Sure.

814
00:49:33,287 --> 00:49:36,962
- Rodney's got this yo, Strike.
- Likes to drink the chocolate Moos.

815
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:40,238
I need yo to talk to me. You mind
laying some cards on him for me?

816
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:42,278
- Depends.
- Need him to sweat.

817
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:45,683
- What'll you do for me?
- Nothin' you don't do for yourself.

818
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:49,242
Strike, my man!
This is a new day, Strike.

819
00:49:49,287 --> 00:49:53,519
Dinkins out, Rudy in. Law and order.
Cut the budget. Party's over.

820
00:49:53,567 --> 00:49:56,798
Crackdown on drugs, crime, niggers,

821
00:49:56,847 --> 00:50:00,840
spics, homeless, squeegeemen,
African-Americans.

822
00:50:00,887 --> 00:50:03,924
Have a seat. So what's up?

823
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,764
Not a thing, Detective.

824
00:50:05,807 --> 00:50:08,116
Detective? Call me Jo-Jo.

825
00:50:08,167 --> 00:50:10,806
You like basketball?.

826
00:50:10,847 --> 00:50:13,077
Nah. I don't like sports.

827
00:50:13,127 --> 00:50:16,517
- What do you like?
- Trains.

828
00:50:16,567 --> 00:50:20,799
Choo-choo trains?
You can't dunk a basketball?.

829
00:50:20,847 --> 00:50:23,407
- Nah.
- Nah. Get the fuck outta here, man.

830
00:50:23,447 --> 00:50:26,564
You been slammin'

831
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:29,519
All right, listen.
I'm here cos I like you.

832
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:32,445
I do. Now, tomorrow night's
gonna be knocko night.

833
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:35,763
We're coming down on these projects
like a fuckin' broom.

834
00:50:35,807 --> 00:50:38,958
So if I was you,
I'd take my homies out, say 9pm,

835
00:50:39,007 --> 00:50:42,283

837
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:45,600
Yeah, bet.

838
00:50:45,647 --> 00:50:48,115
I look out for you,

839
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:51,284
- Yeah, all right.
- No, no, no. No "all right".

840
00:50:51,327 --> 00:50:55,161
I look out for you,
you look out for me.

841
00:50:58,567 --> 00:51:02,446
- You look like 500.
- 500. That's a start.

842
00:51:02,487 --> 00:51:05,399
Good. Every week, I look out for you.

843
00:51:05,447 --> 00:51:09,838
I tell you when we're hittin'. Week
in, week out, you look out for me.

844
00:51:09,887 --> 00:51:11,764
- Cool?.
- Cool.

845
00:51:11,807 --> 00:51:13,877
This is my man Kirby.

846
00:51:16,687 --> 00:51:19,963
Kirby gonna double back in
like 30 minutes. You lay it on him.

847
00:51:20,007 --> 00:51:24,523
You tell your boy Rodney
I got some good stuff he could use.

848
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:27,240
Finest, highest quality.

849
00:51:29,247 --> 00:51:31,238
Peace out.

850
00:51:41,047 --> 00:51:42,924
I think you dropped this.

851
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:45,606
If I was you,
I think I'd call this guy.

852
00:51:46,567 --> 00:51:48,080
(Jo-Jo ) Larry.

853
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,319
Yo, Strike.

854
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:07,919
- Been waiting for 40 minutes...
- Who's here to see Victor Dunham?

855
00:52:11,687 --> 00:52:15,077
(Woman) You told me he was gonna
come down a half-hour ago.

856
00:52:15,127 --> 00:52:17,846
(Desk guard) Watch your tone,
young lady.

857
00:52:31,247 --> 00:52:33,681
Aw, man. I love you. I love you, man.

858
00:52:33,727 --> 00:52:36,082
- Cool, man.
- You look good.

859
00:52:39,927 --> 00:52:41,724
After you, man.

860
00:52:46,407 --> 00:52:48,443
Somebody got bored shaving.

861
00:52:49,487 --> 00:52:52,206
So they decided
to cut me up with a razor.

862
00:52:57,127 --> 00:52:59,482
And they stole my sneakers, too.

863
00:53:00,767 --> 00:53:02,359
Yo, big brother.

864
00:53:04,407 --> 00:53:06,602
(Sighs) You made the papers, man.

865
00:53:15,447 --> 00:53:20,282
Ronnie...
Can you get me outta here, man?

866
00:53:20,327 --> 00:53:24,002
- I'll try. What's the bail?.
- 50,000.

867
00:53:24,047 --> 00:53:26,515
50?! God damn!

868
00:53:27,447 --> 00:53:30,678
- What's the cash options?
- My lawyer says maybe in a week...

869
00:53:30,727 --> 00:53:34,003
I can get that, um,
that ten per cent thing.

870
00:53:34,047 --> 00:53:35,799
- Maybe Rodney got...
- Rodney?

871
00:53:35,847 --> 00:53:38,919
Tell motherfuckers
to stop fuckin' with you.

872
00:53:38,967 --> 00:53:42,164
(Softly ) Yeah, man.
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe.

873
00:53:44,567 --> 00:53:47,525
Look, man, I'm gonna try
to get you outta here, OK?

874
00:53:47,567 --> 00:53:51,958
Ronnie, some of these brothers...
some of these men...

875
00:53:52,567 --> 00:53:54,683
they love jail, man.

876
00:53:54,727 --> 00:53:58,003
But all this, this ain't for me, man.

877
00:53:58,967 --> 00:54:01,435
I'm gonna get you
outta here, all right?

878
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,402
You kiss my babies for me, please?

879
00:54:11,447 --> 00:54:15,042
- All right.
- Thank you.

880
00:54:19,327 --> 00:54:21,966
(Woman) We've been open
for about a year.

881
00:54:22,847 --> 00:54:25,600
We've done pretty well so far.

882
00:54:26,247 --> 00:54:27,726
(Sighs)

883
00:54:28,527 --> 00:54:31,280
When I read about it,
my heart was broken.

884
00:54:31,327 --> 00:54:32,999
Victor is a sweetheart.

885
00:54:33,047 --> 00:54:36,119
- Was he ever late for work?
- Never. Like Swiss movement.

886
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:38,601
- Did he ever steal?.
- No, he was honest.

887
00:54:38,647 --> 00:54:41,241
- Get any visitors?
- No.

888
00:54:44,087 --> 00:54:45,964
See him in here?

889
00:54:46,007 --> 00:54:47,406
No.

890
00:54:47,447 --> 00:54:51,201
Victor was my buffer.
He could talk and reason with them.

891
00:54:51,247 --> 00:54:54,045
Anybody ever threaten him?

892
00:54:54,087 --> 00:54:56,317
# Open up your eyes
and realise things is tough

893
00:54:56,367 --> 00:54:59,245
# Your shit is my rough
when you livin' in the city

894
00:54:59,287 --> 00:55:01,596
# Walk with your head high
step with the bitty-bop

895
00:55:01,647 --> 00:55:04,320
# Got to survive
when you slam or you do or die

896
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,835
# Cos niggers try to read through
a nigger's eyes... #

897
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:09,162
- May I help you?
- Huh?

898
00:55:09,207 --> 00:55:12,199
- May I help you?
- Yeah, let me the fuck in the store.

899
00:55:12,247 --> 00:55:15,398
This is a store, right?
People buy shit in the store.

900
00:55:15,447 --> 00:55:18,883
- What do you wish to buy, brother?
- I wish to buy what you got.

901
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:22,443
Maybe we don't have what you want.

902
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:25,638
Unbelievable. What are you,
the security house nigger?

903
00:55:25,687 --> 00:55:28,997
- What? They rent you by the hour?
- We're just trying to help...

904
00:55:29,047 --> 00:55:30,241
Fuck that, man!

905
00:55:30,287 --> 00:55:33,996
Cos I'm black, that automatically
mean I'm gonna steal something.

906
00:55:34,047 --> 00:55:37,244
Nigger, I came in here
to buy a birthday gift for my mom!

907
00:55:37,287 --> 00:55:38,800
But you ain't shit

908
00:55:38,847 --> 00:55:41,998
and neither is this bullshit kung fu
Chinese bitch store!

909
00:55:43,647 --> 00:55:45,638
Fuck you, motherfucker!

910
00:55:45,687 --> 00:55:48,759
I'm gonna bring my steel
and pump bullets in your ass.

911
00:55:48,807 --> 00:55:50,001
Think I'm playing?

912
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:53,198
You disrespectin' me
on my mother's birthday...nigger!

913
00:55:53,247 --> 00:55:55,715
Listen up, man.
I G's up twice a day, man.

914
00:55:55,767 --> 00:55:57,439
How much you make in a month?

915
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:02,038
See this? See this?
It's a hundred dollar bill, right?

916
00:56:03,807 --> 00:56:06,037
Use it in your kid's birthday.

917
00:56:06,087 --> 00:56:09,921
I'm gonna come back here.
I'm gonna kill your ass.

918
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:11,559
Thank you.

919
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,721
I'm gonna kill your ass.

920
00:56:16,967 --> 00:56:20,437
- (Woman) What did he want?
- Nothin'.

921
00:56:22,287 --> 00:56:26,405
- Did that kid ever come back?
- No.

922
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:37,326
- Hey, what's up, Mr Brown?
- Hey, Mr Dunham.

923
00:56:37,367 --> 00:56:40,404
Yo, Ty, that's my landlord,
Mr Brown. Say, what's up?

924
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:43,280
- How you doing, sir?
- Pleased to meet you, young man.

925
00:56:43,327 --> 00:56:45,557
This is Tyrone.
This is my little brother.

926
00:56:45,607 --> 00:56:49,043
Anybody bother you, and his head's
out here, you let me know.

927
00:56:49,087 --> 00:56:51,885
I got something
for the crackheads my damn self.

928
00:56:51,927 --> 00:56:55,124
You do like your big brother.
Leave those drugs alone.

929
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:57,681
Hey, I got some food on the stove.
See ya later.

930
00:56:57,727 --> 00:57:02,118
All right. Peace.
Now, go up the steps. Hurry up.

931
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:07,165
Hey, Shorty.
What you doin'? Don't touch that.

932
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:10,324
Buggin'. You know anything
about what you're touchin'?

933
00:57:10,367 --> 00:57:12,483
- No!
- (Tuts)

934
00:57:13,407 --> 00:57:14,726
Little buster.

935
00:57:16,327 --> 00:57:20,320
Lionel Trains, right?
They was built in the early 1900s.

936
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:24,280
But them cheap shits,
they only ran on dry cell batteries.

937
00:57:24,327 --> 00:57:27,285
But, yo, after World War II,

938
00:57:27,327 --> 00:57:31,479
when more folks started getting
electricity in their cribs,

939
00:57:31,527 --> 00:57:34,246
boom, they made the new ones.

940
00:57:34,287 --> 00:57:37,404
(Strike ) Yeah, phat, right?
(Tyrone ) Yeah.

941
00:57:37,447 --> 00:57:41,838
Yo, profit's all in the cut.
Don't never forget that.

942
00:57:43,647 --> 00:57:47,242
Yo, Shorty, if I ever see
or even hear about you

943
00:57:47,287 --> 00:57:51,644
messin' with this stuff right here,
man, sniffin' or pipin' up...

944
00:57:51,687 --> 00:57:54,599
(Sighs) Yo, come here, man.

945
00:57:54,647 --> 00:57:56,399
The word to my mother.

946
00:58:00,927 --> 00:58:02,758
Put a cap in your ass.

947
00:58:02,807 --> 00:58:05,685
This ain't no TV movie
violence bullshit neither.

948
00:58:05,727 --> 00:58:07,445
This stuff out here is real.

949
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:10,604
Real bullets hurt.
And real guns kills you dead.

950
00:58:10,647 --> 00:58:14,276
See this right here?
This is .25 automatic.

951
00:58:15,647 --> 00:58:18,957
I keeps this for all them
ill niggers out there.

952
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:22,317
Like that one dude Errol.
Now that brother's crazy.

953
00:58:22,367 --> 00:58:25,165
He will blast your ass,
just won't give a fuck.

954
00:58:25,207 --> 00:58:28,119
The messed-up thing is
that they never find the body.

955
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:30,123
Just the blood stains on the ground.

956
00:58:30,167 --> 00:58:33,239
If he ever try to creep up on me,
I'm gonna gat his ass.

957
00:58:33,287 --> 00:58:35,437
You best be ready
to do the same shit, too.

958
00:58:35,487 --> 00:58:38,320
Aw, don't think
that just cos you're 12,

959
00:58:38,367 --> 00:58:41,837
small and shit,
that he won't smoke you.

960
00:58:41,887 --> 00:58:44,640
Just last year,
he caught himself a ten-year-old.

961
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:48,441
I knows you probably thinking about
what Mr Brown said earlier and all.

962
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:51,001
But, chill, don't even
sweat that shit, man.

963
00:58:51,047 --> 00:58:53,880
He's old and po'.
He don't know what time it is.

964
00:58:53,927 --> 00:58:56,077
This is how you get
that money right here.

965
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:58,800
How do you think I got
that phat-ass train set?

966
00:58:58,847 --> 00:59:01,042
From pumpin'
this white shit right here.

967
00:59:01,087 --> 00:59:03,885
Any fly shit you want
in this world, it costs money.

968
00:59:03,927 --> 00:59:09,160
And this is how you get it. Hustling.
Don't never forget that shit neither.

969
00:59:09,207 --> 00:59:10,560
(Sighs)

970
00:59:12,367 --> 00:59:16,485
Yo, Shorty, you're smart, right?
Well, answer me this.

971
00:59:17,447 --> 00:59:20,803
Boss buys him a key
for $22,000, right?

972
00:59:20,847 --> 00:59:24,078
Cuts it up to 3,500 $10 bottles.

973
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:29,759
Boss takes 60%, $17,000 profit,
leaving up $7,000,

974
00:59:29,807 --> 00:59:31,798
50% of which is mine.

975
00:59:32,967 --> 00:59:34,958
How much for me?

976
00:59:39,167 --> 00:59:40,919
3,500.

977
00:59:40,967 --> 00:59:43,686
My man, Shorty.
Keep hittin' them books, all right?

978
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:44,955
All right.

979
00:59:45,007 --> 00:59:48,602
If I ever catch you playing hooky,
I'll put a cap in your ass.

980
00:59:48,647 --> 00:59:52,083
# My name is M-O
and don't you forget it

981
00:59:52,127 --> 00:59:55,278
# Takin' out your boys
and you don't know how I did it

982
00:59:55,327 --> 00:59:57,887
# Pickin' off your crew one by one

983
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,317
# Don't step in my way
cos I just might have a gun

984
01:00:01,367 --> 01:00:04,325
# May be loaded just might not be

985
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,722
# Cos I'm a menace to society

986
01:00:06,767 --> 01:00:09,804
# My name not Thiggy-thiggy
but I still get hip

987
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:12,998
- # So back the fuck up and just
- (Boys) # Chill

988
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:15,800
# Cos steppin' on me
you'll be a-writin' your will

989
01:00:15,847 --> 01:00:18,645
# I'm like an Energizer
can't never die

990
01:00:18,687 --> 01:00:21,963
# Ba, ba, ba, ba, nice try

991
01:00:22,007 --> 01:00:24,965
# Ha, ha, ha,
I saw you run in the building

992
01:00:25,007 --> 01:00:27,919
# Throwing up my guns
to the ceiling

993
01:00:27,967 --> 01:00:30,640
# Ba, ba, ba, here I go again

994
01:00:30,687 --> 01:00:33,326
# Ba, ba, ba, cops are comin' in

995
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:35,961
# Run into the back, man
I'm fast up the staircase

996
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,486
# I got no time to waste

997
01:00:37,527 --> 01:00:40,599
# Nobody seen my face
so I leave without a trace... #

998
01:00:41,727 --> 01:00:43,479
(Sighs)

999
01:00:44,367 --> 01:00:47,120
Make the drops over on Smith Street
from now on.

1000
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:48,805
Yeah, all right.

1001
01:00:48,847 --> 01:00:51,520
Oh, yeah, crooked-ass Jo-Jo.

1002
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:54,001
He said he got
some weight for you to buy.

1003
01:00:54,047 --> 01:00:56,322
Forget that motherfucker.

1004
01:00:56,367 --> 01:00:59,962
Fuckin' faggot.
He tapped me up for $500, too.

1005
01:01:04,287 --> 01:01:08,280
Errol told me you talked
to the homicide cop.

1006
01:01:09,087 --> 01:01:11,601
- How'd that go?
- It was aight.

1007
01:01:13,887 --> 01:01:15,798
"Aight" or all right?

1008
01:01:16,567 --> 01:01:19,843
It was "aight," all right?

1009
01:01:27,607 --> 01:01:30,519
I ever tell you about
the first time I killed somebody?

1010
01:01:30,567 --> 01:01:31,636
Nah.

1011
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:33,598
Errol Barnes made me do it...

1012
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:37,000
cos it was three guys burned us
on some bogus dope.

1013
01:01:37,047 --> 01:01:40,039
(Gunshots)

1014
01:01:40,087 --> 01:01:42,521
'Errol's already killed
the other two, right?

1015
01:01:42,567 --> 01:01:43,795
'We got the third guy.'

1016
01:01:43,847 --> 01:01:47,317
Be cool, man.
Chill, motherfucker, chill.

1017
01:01:47,367 --> 01:01:49,403
Ain't you all sorry
you fucked with us?

1018
01:01:49,447 --> 01:01:50,721
I ain't fucked with you.

1019
01:01:50,767 --> 01:01:53,839
You're lucky we don't blow your ass
off like them crackers down South.

1020
01:01:53,887 --> 01:01:57,038
- Look, I hate this shit, man.
- (Errol) What the fuck is my name?

1021
01:01:57,087 --> 01:01:59,555
- Errol, man.
- You're goddam right.

1022
01:01:59,607 --> 01:02:01,757
(Rodney ) 'Motherfucker
crying like a baby.

1023
01:02:01,807 --> 01:02:04,162
'Tears, snot flying, and shit.
Errol turned to me.'

1024
01:02:04,207 --> 01:02:08,644
(Errol and Rodney ) Says, "You got
to cap him, or I'm gonna cap you."

1025
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:11,838
Man, come on, that shit
ain't necessary, man.

1026
01:02:11,887 --> 01:02:15,323
'I ain't gonna cap that boy.
He's scared like a motherfucker.'

1027
01:02:15,367 --> 01:02:18,643
You think I'm playin' with you?
Open your mouth.

1028
01:02:18,687 --> 01:02:20,518
You gonna take this piece...

1029
01:02:20,567 --> 01:02:23,445
and you're gonna put that
motherfucker's brains out.

1030
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,957
- You understand me?!
- I got it.

1031
01:02:29,087 --> 01:02:30,566
Go to it.

1032
01:02:30,607 --> 01:02:32,882
I said you shouldn't
have did that shit, man.

1033
01:02:32,927 --> 01:02:36,681
- Come on, please! Please!
- (Errol) On three, Rodney.

1034
01:02:36,727 --> 01:02:39,116
I can't stop my hand from shakin'.

1035
01:02:39,167 --> 01:02:43,126
- Don't you chump out on me.
- I can't stop my hand from shakin'!

1036
01:02:43,167 --> 01:02:45,044
- Cap him!
- All right!

1037
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:46,645
Please...

1038
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:52,527
(Laughing) Don't you wish
you'd done us right?

1039
01:02:52,567 --> 01:02:56,845
(Errol) Hey, hey, hey. Don't you
ever, ever fuck with me, boy.

1040
01:02:57,927 --> 01:03:02,557
Do you know me now? I'm a bad man.

1041
01:03:02,607 --> 01:03:06,202
Errol couldn't have me runnin'
around here knowin' what he did

1042
01:03:06,247 --> 01:03:09,398
without somethin' personal
hangin' over my head, too.

1043
01:03:09,447 --> 01:03:11,642
Personal, Strike.

1044
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:14,918
Otherwise, I might give him up
someday, you understand?

1045
01:03:17,567 --> 01:03:20,206
Strike, that's the reason why

1046
01:03:20,247 --> 01:03:24,286
I needed you to be bloody
on this Darryl thing.

1047
01:03:25,727 --> 01:03:27,319
You hear me?

1048
01:03:28,047 --> 01:03:30,402
'Errol Barnes, boy.'

1049
01:03:30,447 --> 01:03:33,883
Motherfucker had a sawed-off
shotgun right in my mug, Strike.

1050
01:03:33,927 --> 01:03:36,839
He's my best friend, too.

1051
01:03:36,887 --> 01:03:39,117
(Gagging)

1052
01:03:40,527 --> 01:03:43,166
- What's the matter with you?
- Shit!

1053
01:03:46,527 --> 01:03:48,518
You gotta take care of yourself.

1054
01:03:48,567 --> 01:03:51,479
Here. Wipe that off.

1055
01:03:52,967 --> 01:03:54,764
You OK?

1056
01:03:55,607 --> 01:03:58,724
You ain't seen my doctor, have you?

1057
01:03:58,767 --> 01:04:01,804
- Huh?
- Nah.

1058
01:04:01,847 --> 01:04:06,716
Strike, why I got to tell you things
two and three and four times, huh?

1059
01:04:06,767 --> 01:04:09,361
Why you don't want to listen to me?

1060
01:04:10,487 --> 01:04:12,284
You OK?

1061
01:04:15,487 --> 01:04:16,886
Shit.

1062
01:04:16,927 --> 01:04:20,442
To be honest, I don't really
give a fuck because you lied to me.

1063
01:04:20,487 --> 01:04:24,526
Lied about what? You said Darryl
had a drug problem, a crackhead.

1064
01:04:24,567 --> 01:04:27,320
I asked around. The guy was clean.

1065
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:29,323
I was just speculatin'.

1066
01:04:29,367 --> 01:04:31,676
That's some nasty-ass speculatin'.

1067
01:04:35,007 --> 01:04:38,044
Damn. You're comin'
at me with mad questions.

1068
01:04:38,087 --> 01:04:40,237
I'm just tryin'
to answer them shits.

1069
01:04:40,287 --> 01:04:43,359
Then you said you never met 'im.

1070
01:04:43,407 --> 01:04:45,523
Maybe just by eye, all right?

1071
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:49,606
"Just by eye."
You and him never had any static?

1072
01:04:49,647 --> 01:04:51,239
Naw.

1073
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:55,075
There's no way Victor could've been
cuttin' through the parking lot

1074
01:04:55,127 --> 01:04:58,164
in the dark, and Darryl would've
mistaken him for you?

1075
01:04:58,207 --> 01:04:59,845
Naw, man.

1076
01:04:59,887 --> 01:05:02,037
Cos you and your brother,
in the dark,

1077
01:05:02,087 --> 01:05:04,157
probably look like two peas in a pod.

1078
01:05:04,207 --> 01:05:07,358
What the fuck you sayin'?
All black people look alike at night?

1079
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:10,638
I can't even tell you guys
apart in the day.

1080
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:12,723
Hey, you got jokes.

1081
01:05:12,767 --> 01:05:13,000
- You and your brother close?
- Not really.
