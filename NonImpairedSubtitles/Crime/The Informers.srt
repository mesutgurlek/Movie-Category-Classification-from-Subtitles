1
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,968
What the fuck?

2
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,914
Tell me something, Roger.

3
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,241
Set your watch back.
There's a time difference.

4
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,512
We're landing in Los Angeles.

5
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,345
It's a city in California.

6
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,322
Anything else you want to know?

7
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,627
You all right, Bryan?

8
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,366
You on edge? Want a Valium? Lude?

9
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:58,828
Gum?

10
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,642
I used to live here, didn't l?

11
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,586
What did he call it?

12
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,651
A talking tomato?

13
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,122
It's a fucking extraterrestrial, Ron.

14
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,459
So you're telling me
that he's not gonna sign off

15
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,002
until we redesign the talking tomato?

16
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,369
Well, that's bullshit.
Ron, listen, listen to me.

17
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,135
Let me inform you of something, okay?

18
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:41,677
We don't let 25- year- olds
tell us how to make movies.

19
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,114
Listen, I gotta go. I gotta go, Ron.

20
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,188
Just call... Ron, call me later, okay?

21
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:21,046
Fast- acting Power Soap really gets in
and blasts stains,

22
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,554
Ieaving your whole wash fresh and clean,

23
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,750
with a brightness
that people will really notice.

24
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,554
Wow! That's incredible.

25
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,392
I thought that ketchup stain
would never come out of Joe's polo shirt.

26
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,298
Whites simply come out whiter
and colors simply come out brighter.

27
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:40,862
It's the kind of clean that people
will really notice and talk about.

28
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,871
How did you lift those coffee stains?

29
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:46,467
I thought I was gonna have
to throw my new pantsuit out.

30
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,575
I blasted it out with Power Soap!

31
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,528
...and lets you get on with your day.

32
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:18,036
President and Mrs. Reagan visited
the grieving families and bereaved widows

33
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,773
of the more than 200 Marines
killed last Sunday in Beirut.

34
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,516
He used the occasion
to condemn the actions of what he called

35
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,880
"ruthless terrorists who..."

36
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,753
What time is it?

37
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,191
10:30.

38
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,393
Fuck.

39
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:19,496
Fuck.

40
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,372
We gotta go. We're gonna be late.

41
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,485
Right. That.

42
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,149
I forgot.

43
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,153
Christie, come on. What are you doing?

44
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,022
I don't feel well.

45
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,522
I don't really want to go.

46
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,468
Neither do l.

47
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,867
Look, I'm not gonna let you...

48
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,474
Good morning.

49
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:05,016
Look, you want to know
why you're not welcome at my house?

50
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,448
Because you're fucked up!

51
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:10,147
That's not a good enough reason.
That's not even a reason.

52
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,056
That's just one person's opinion.

53
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,760
Look, I don't even want to fucking deal
with you right now, do you understand me?

54
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,028
Listen, I'm calling you from a payphone
outside of Barstow,

55
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,160
and I ain't got any more quarters.
It's simple.

56
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,132
Me and the Indian need a place to hang out
for a couple of days.

57
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,231
We have a plan.

58
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,471
I don't want to hear
about your fucking plan, Peter.

59
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,707
It doesn't involve you,
so stop pissing yourself.

60
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,757
When you lose a child,

61
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:54,764
you can't help but wonder
what that child's life would have been like.

62
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,596
You can't help but imagine his future.

63
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,801
A future that now

64
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,076
doesn't exist.

65
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:12,649
But Bruce lived a full life,
and there's some comfort in that.

66
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:18,182
And that he was a good boy,

67
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:24,156
and that he had done all the things
he had ever wanted to do.

68
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:29,961
That the privilege and freedom
that was granted to him

69
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:35,739
during his brief time in this world
were what made him happy.

70
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:43,947
I tell myself that I can only
cherish one fact.

71
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,412
He had everything.

72
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,822
And now, in conclusion,

73
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,955
I'm going to play Bruce's favorite song.

74
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,394
It meant a lot to him.

75
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,804
- Hi.
- Hi.

76
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,636
So I made the reservations for 8:30.

77
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,444
- Where?
- Spago.

78
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,276
Okay. Did you tell Susan and Graham?

79
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,088
Well, no. I thought it was
just gonna be the two of us.

80
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:01,751
William, I'm not really comfortable
with that right now.

81
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,487
Okay.

82
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,961
Well, I'll call them
and tell them to join us, then.

83
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:11,764
- Or you could call them.
- No. No, you should do that.

84
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:13,763
Okay.

85
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,067
What the fuck
was with that favorite song, man?

86
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,345
Bruce had shitty taste in music, but no way.

87
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,676
Personally, I think his mom just liked it.

88
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:29,016
The real question is, what in the hell are
my mom and dad doing by the sushi bar?

89
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,748
I mean, they're actually
talking to each other.

90
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,881
At least your mom and dad are talking.

91
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,517
My mom gets to talk to my dad
through his lawyers.

92
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,324
Guess what?
I get to go to Hawaii with the asshole.

93
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,831
I can't fucking believe this shit.

94
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,011
I can't believe you guys
are acting this way.

95
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:45,003
Acting?

96
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,931
What way, Ray- Ray?

97
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,675
Don't tell me he's gonna cry again.

98
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,668
Fuck!

99
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,004
Face it. Bruce was a jerk.

100
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,242
Okay? He's dead. It's over.
Let's not fucking dwell on it.

101
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,080
I can't believe you guys
don't fucking give a shit.

102
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,745
You seem like you don't give a shit.

103
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,880
Look, Raymond,
there's nothing we can do, okay?

104
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,958
It happened. It's over.
It's time to move on.

105
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,028
He's right, Raymond.
It's already been a week.

106
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,463
Okay. Bruce...

107
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,333
Bruce was a...

108
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,500
A cool guy.

109
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,396
What else can I tell you, Raymond?
I'm sorry it happened.

110
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,168
"Bruce was a cool guy"? Really, Graham?

111
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,707
Okay, what does that even mean, "Cool"?

112
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,540
Especially after that shit
he pulled with Christie.

113
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:31,241
- Martin, what the fuck are you doing?
- What shit did he pull with Christie?

114
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,478
- Martin.
- Bruce was fucking her behind your back.

115
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,616
What, like, you all knew about this?

116
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,524
Graham, you always say
that you're not that serious about Christie.

117
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:44,994
And it's not like you haven't fucked around.

118
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,588
You know, you're never gonna win
Boyfriend of the Year.

119
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,567
- She's my girlfriend, Martin.
- Look, who even knows if it's true?

120
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:54,366
It's just something Bruce told us
and that he bragged about.

121
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,832
Hey, does anybody want to go to a movie?

122
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,569
Sure, what's playing?

123
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:02,272
I can't believe you guys
are gonna go see a fucking movie.

124
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,749
What the...

125
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,473
I can't believe you don't give a shit, man.

126
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,279
- I was there, you asshole.
- Hey, come on!

127
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,013
I watched him fucking bleed to death
just like you did,

128
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,214
so don't give me this shit
about how I don't care.

129
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,690
I had his blood all over my face. Fuck.

130
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,131
Someone should go talk to him.

131
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,292
Tim, Bruce thought
Raymond was an asshole.

132
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,899
He fucking loathed the dude, okay?
And what the fuck does it even matter?

133
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,033
We're having a fucking wake
at the Beverly Hilton.

134
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,872
I mean, come on, do you get it?

135
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,818
Come on. Get up.

136
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,226
Bruce wouldn't want to see you like this.

137
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,566
He was my friend, right?

138
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,504
Yeah. He was your friend.

139
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,832
Are you lying to me, Graham?

140
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:06,934
No.

141
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,637
I'm telling you the truth.

142
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,970
How's work?

143
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,105
It's good.

144
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,840
I have a full slate of movies
that are testing really high.

145
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,651
- There's one you might really like.
- Yeah? What's that?

146
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,652
It's a movie about this 12- year- old boy
who becomes the president.

147
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,693
The president of what?

148
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,322
The United States.

149
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,795
Sounds better than the one
about the talking car.

150
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,193
How's Graham?

151
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:09,502
Well, you know your brother.
He's a little hard to reach.

152
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,668
But I'm sure he's upset
about his friend's death,

153
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,746
so, you know, it's tough.

154
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:19,217
When I saw him at the memorial,
he seemed fine, though.

155
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,911
He seemed fine at Bruce's memorial?

156
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,948
Yeah.

157
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,754
So how's Cheryl, by the way?

158
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,965
I'm not seeing Cheryl anymore.

159
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,125
What? When did this happen?

160
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:41,230
That's something
I wanted to talk to you about, actually.

161
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,476
- You talk to your mom lately?
- We talk.

162
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:50,876
You know, when she's coherent,
which is rarely. Why?

163
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,780
Well, Mom and l
are moving back in together.

164
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,353
We're going to live together again.

165
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,292
She didn't tell me that.

166
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,293
- How do you feel about that?
- Great.

167
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,695
Great. This is a really good move.
Yeah. Really good.

168
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,597
Seriously? I mean,
you really think it's great?

169
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:13,934
Well, to be honest, it hasn't totally hit me
that you might actually be serious.

170
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,438
I'm serious.

171
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,374
We're going to be a family again.

172
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,676
Graham and I aren't moving back in, Dad.
We're not gonna be a family.

173
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:28,219
You and Mom are gonna be a couple again,
but we're not gonna be a family.

174
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,458
Martin?

175
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,968
You can't call the house anymore.

176
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,873
Why? Is there someone here who cares?

177
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,606
You just can't come over here anymore.

178
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,754
- No.
- Are you going to tell me why?

179
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,285
William is moving back in.

180
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,834
Are you telling me
he dumped the newscaster chick?

181
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,442
So...

182
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,287
Big Bad William is moving back in.

183
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,759
So the fuck what? Unless you wanna
shell out for a room at the Bel- Air...

184
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,990
No, Martin. Martin, you don't understand.

185
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,758
We can't do this anymore.
We can't do it. It's over.

186
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,037
Right.

187
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,383
Just like it was over the last time?

188
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,053
Martin, don't.

189
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:13,849
Baby.

190
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,732
I see.

191
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,941
Well, could I at least

192
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,976
borrow 60 bucks?

193
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,349
I have to pay this guy
for these Billy ldol tickets.

194
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,914
And I forgot to go to the lnsta- Teller
and, you know...

195
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,158
You know,
it's just really a massive hassle, so...

196
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:38,800
What can I do for you, Mr. Metro?

197
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,812
Can you just get these kids
out of here, man?

198
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,461
- Hey! What are you doing? Come on.
- All right. Time to go.

199
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,127
No!

200
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,997
Hey, Jackson. How's it hanging?

201
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,768
What the fuck are you doing here?

202
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,339
I told you I was coming.

203
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,039
What'd you think, it was a joke?

204
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,546
One fucking night. And that's it.
You understand me?

205
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:55,276
Jackson, will you chill out, man,
and show your Uncle Pete a little love, huh?

206
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,920
Well, where's this fucking
lndian friend of yours?

207
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,322
Indian's in the desert.

208
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,794
What the fuck does that even mean,
"The lndian's in the desert"?

209
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,092
Indian did some bad stuff.

210
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,859
Decided to stay in Barstow.

211
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,763
He's laying low, if you get my drift.

212
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,433
But Mary's in the van.

213
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,801
- Who's Mary?
- Come on, I'll show you.

214
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,553
Jackson, this is Mary.

215
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,259
Mary? Mary, this is Jackson.

216
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,927
Is she okay?

217
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,962
Yeah, she's sort of just taking it all in.

218
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:47,036
She saw some stuff. Bothered her.

219
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,564
- How old is this girl?
- I don't know.

220
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,440
Sixteen. Seventeen. I never ask.

221
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,034
Lucifer?

222
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,704
What the fuck are you doing
with two underage kids?

223
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,508
How many times
are we gonna go through this?

224
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:39,778
It does not matter if it was consensual.

225
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,680
I fucked up my hand.

226
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,155
How'd you do it? Did someone help you?

227
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,282
I did it shaving, man. Who the fuck cares?

228
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:51,158
My hand is fucked up.
Just... Just call a doctor, Roger.

229
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:55,196
We are meeting Gary Gray,
the movie producer.

230
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:00,371
You know, I don't know if I'm going
to be able to make that meeting, Roger.

231
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,771
Look, I'll send the hotel doctor up
and then you're gonna pull it together.

232
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,809
And when I knock on your door,
you are going to answer it

233
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:09,472
without your cock hanging out
of some 14- year- old girl's ass. Got it?

234
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,446
And you're going to be wearing something
with long sleeves.

235
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,313
- Why?
- Multiple choice.

236
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:15,045
A, you look nice in long sleeves.

237
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:19,112
B, you have holes in your arms.
C, you have holes in your arms.

238
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,624
Or D, you have holes in your arms.

239
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,960
- C.
- Really?

240
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:25,240
Yeah?

241
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,116
Graham, it's for you.

242
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,224
- It's Dirk.
- Shit.

243
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,272
Hey, Dirk.

244
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,169
Yeah.

245
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,974
What do you need?

246
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,613
Yeah, I can get that for you.

247
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:04,613
Okay.

248
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,089
A little business?

249
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:14,956
Yeah. And my fucking car's at my mom's.

250
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:18,467
- Can you give me a ride?
- Can't. I'm going to Hawaii.

251
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,038
Well, fuck, dude,
give me a better excuse than that.

252
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,198
I wish I could. Thanks.

253
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,270
Aloha.

254
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,916
Can you give me a lift?

255
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,183
Don't look at me, dude.

256
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:57,498
Bye.

257
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,626
So how're you doing, Tim?

258
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:21,294
I'm good. Fine. How are you?

259
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,767
I'm doing good, I guess.

260
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:28,199
- You want a drink?
- No, that's all right.

261
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,604
Come on. Have a drink.

262
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,906
- I'm okay.
- I'm gonna pour you one anyway.

263
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,976
So, what have you been up to?

264
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,982
Kind of a tough thing
about that friend of yours dying, huh?

265
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:49,150
- You want to talk about that?
- What time does the plane leave?

266
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,295
11:00 sharp.

267
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,441
You wanna hear something?

268
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:08,776
Who's this?

269
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,778
- I think it's Devo.
- Who?

270
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,022
It's a group called Devo.

271
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,159
Great. I love it.

272
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,156
Yeah.

273
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,034
Hey. Hey.

274
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:36,205
I think it's great you could finally
get away with your old man, you know?

275
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,834
Your mom said maybe
you weren't gonna be able to make it.

276
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,471
- But here you are.
- I'm here.

277
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,915
We're going to Hawaii. It's gonna be great.

278
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:05,530
The virus's unknown origin
and seeming selectivity is creating fear.

279
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:09,698
Gays, intravenous drug users and Haitians
seem particularly to be at risk.

280
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,902
The virus reacts almost like
a contagious form of cancer.

281
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:16,606
I'm trying to stay positive.
I think in my situation it's very...

282
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:28,115
And it's where film meets rock
and we're all happy.

283
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,294
- Bryan.
- Okay, an idea for a movie.

284
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:36,124
And the reason we came to Bryan Metro
is because people remember

285
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:40,000
how intense that movie turned out
about the life of the band.

286
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:46,309
Holy Christ, man, the four of you guys,
Sam and Matt and...

287
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,140
- Ed. His name was Ed.
- Yeah. Yeah.

288
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,812
That's known as a real tragedy, huh?
A real shame.

289
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,582
Upsetting, too, I bet. Right?

290
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:03,117
When your bassist jumps from the roof
of the Clift Hotel, I'd say so.

291
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,253
They'd already split up by then, so...

292
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:09,390
Yeah. Well, anyways,
since that movie about the life of the band

293
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,527
turned out to be so cool and so profitable,
without exploiting anyone,

294
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,631
we were wondering
if you'd be pleased and thrilled

295
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,038
to star in a movie,

296
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,378
one where you would actually play yourself.

297
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,010
We get so many scripts.

298
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:30,451
Bryan turned down Amadeus,
so we're very fussy.

299
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:35,288
Well, this movie is basically your typical
rock- star- in- outer- space- type thing.

300
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,688
There's this alien creature, this ET.

301
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:42,391
- ET?
- Extraterrestrial. Alien.

302
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,493
Yeah. The ET sabotages Bryan's limo
after a gig,

303
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:50,734
and there's a big fiery chase and somehow...

304
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:55,203
- We haven't quite got that nailed yet...
- Yeah, go on.

305
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:59,113
You all end up on a planet
where Bryan falls in love with a princess.

306
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:02,243
We're thinking Pat Benatar
or a Go- Go for that.

307
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,283
In order to escape the planet,

308
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:10,016
you have to play in this big concert
for the emperor,

309
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:14,623
who's basically this giant tomato.

310
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,672
So it's madcap, right?

311
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,506
- It's not tacky...
- Yes.

312
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,103
...and everyone is getting
very excited by it.

313
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,543
Bryan?

314
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:38,879
Bryan. Bryan?

315
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,956
Thank you so much for coming.

316
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,618
Hey, what are you doing here?

317
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,559
Christie, you know my sister, Susan, right?

318
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,130
- Have you guys met?
- Yeah. Hi.

319
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,902
Okay, well, I'm gonna get a drink.

320
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:30,506
- Cool, baby. You wanna bring me one, too?
- Nice shirt.

321
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,168
Ditto.

322
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,942
Does she always dress like that?
Movies, restaurants and stuff?

323
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,812
- You a little jealous?
- Graham!

324
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,009
Hey, mellow out.

325
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,643
Did you know
they were gonna go through with it?

326
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:43,812
What?

327
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:48,147
Mom and Dad? Yeah.
Mom mentioned something when I woke up.

328
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,988
What a scandal, huh?

329
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,825
Oh, my God, you're so stoned.

330
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,829
You're such a stoner.
I can't even talk to you.

331
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,525
I'm really not stoned, okay?
Just mellow out.

332
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:05,839
- You should talk to him.
- And say what exactly?

333
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:11,214
I don't know. "Dad, this isn't a good idea.
Don't go through..."

334
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,941
Okay? All right.

335
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,788
Let's take off, all right? What do you say?

336
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,886
Graham, do you even care
what he did to Mom?

337
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:29,662
And now he's back and he's just gonna do
the same thing again.

338
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,201
Look, I had to take care of her,
okay, Graham?

339
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:35,739
I had to take care of Mom,
and I'm not gonna do it again!

340
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,603
Graham. Graham!

341
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:42,677
Please. We have to do something, okay?

342
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,575
If Dad pulls the same shit again,
Mom isn't gonna make it.

343
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:48,447
This will destroy her. Do you understand?

344
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,204
Cheryl, there's someone on the phone.

345
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,399
- William Sloan.
- Thank you.

346
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,986
- What?
- I called the house and no one answered.

347
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,523
I was hoping it was the wrong number.

348
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,991
Yeah, well, it's not the wrong number.

349
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,391
So why haven't you been home?

350
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:08,522
Because I've been busy.
I'm filling in for Suzanne Yakomiato.

351
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,568
I really want to see you.

352
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:14,027
What about Laura, William?

353
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,497
What about her?

354
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,999
What about Laura?

355
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,935
I think I really miss you.

356
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,480
I think I'm making a big mistake.

357
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,388
- Let me go!
- Shut up!

358
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:13,655
- Mary, go!
- I have no license.

359
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:16,130
Get in the fucking car and drive.

360
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,043
What do you think?

361
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,419
About what?

362
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,056
What do you think I mean?

363
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,416
Next to us. Them.

364
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,156
What about them?

365
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,560
Don't you go out with girls?

366
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:53,500
Pardon me?

367
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,635
Don't you, like, date females?

368
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,475
What are you asking me?

369
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,309
The odds look good.

370
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,042
The odds look pretty good.

371
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,516
Ladies, what are you drinking tonight?

372
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:15,785
Pahohoes.

373
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:19,329
Pahohoes? That sounds intriguing.

374
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:21,991
They're delicious.

375
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,931
Hey, Hickey?

376
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:30,068
Why don't you bring these two gorgeous
ladies another round of pahohoes?

377
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,405
Where you gals from?

378
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:35,778
We came in from Chicago.

379
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,375
I'm Patty and this is Darlene.

380
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,780
Yeah. The Windy City.

381
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:44,547
- I know it well.
- Where are you both from?

382
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,020
Los Angeles.

383
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,948
City of Angels.

384
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,354
I'm Les Price and this is my son, Tim.

385
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,727
He's a little shy.

386
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,165
Just the two of you?

387
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,166
Just the two of us.

388
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,941
Hey. I hope...

389
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:13,483
I hope I'm not being too forward
if I may ask you something.

390
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,411
- I'm sure you won't be, Les.
- Jesus.

391
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,921
Well, I was just wondering
if you're here with anyone.

392
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,987
- We're here alone.
- All alone.

393
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,595
- All alone.
- Can I have the key to the room?

394
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,292
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the room.

395
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:32,767
Where do you think I'd be going?

396
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,276
You didn't finish your drink.

397
00:39:34,377 --> 00:39:36,499
I don't want the drink.
Just give me the key.

398
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,370
I'll go up with you.

399
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:43,607
No. Just stay here, see how it plays out
with Patty and Marlene.

400
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,471
That's Darlene.

401
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,455
What's wrong with him, Les?

402
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,328
Troubles in school.

403
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,899
- His mother.
- Okay.

404
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,674
No, no thanks.

405
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,723
You said you were hungry.
I made this for you.

406
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:30,260
No, my stomach's queasy.
I'm not really hungry anymore.

407
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,089
I really don't know how something
like this could happen.

408
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:36,860
It all seemed to be going so well
and now it's just a big mess.

409
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:40,835
It'll never happen again, I promise.
You're not gonna fire me, are you?

410
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,304
Well, no, I'm not gonna fire you.

411
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:49,077
Look, I have no idea what this is.

412
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:54,845
- And another one on my foot.
- Yeah, I don't know what it is either.

413
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,512
Look, Christie, tell me something.

414
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:58,880
What?

415
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,788
What do you think about Martin?

416
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,324
He's cool. He's hot.

417
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:07,293
Yeah, hot.

418
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:12,396
Well, I know that, but I'm just not sure

419
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:15,131
I'm at the same place that you are,

420
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:19,734
you know, with everything
that's been going on with him.

421
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,580
Forget it. Sorry I brought it up.

422
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,276
Graham.

423
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:31,046
Martin's not even staying here.
He's staying at Nina Metro's.

424
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,521
Even though he said she was insane.

425
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,787
That reminds me. Did you get tickets
for tomorrow night at the Greek?

426
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,259
Bryan Metro?

427
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,158
Graham.

428
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,865
You know he doesn't mean
as much as you to me.

429
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:50,699
Come on.

430
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:53,242
Graham, we're all just having fun,
you know?

431
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,507
Like, you take it all so seriously.

432
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:59,310
Yeah, but you're also sleeping with him,
and it's just stressing me out.

433
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:02,078
What's wrong? You know I'm on the pill.

434
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,017
Graham?

435
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,526
- Graham?
- Yeah?

436
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,622
You're forgetting something.

437
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,922
What?

438
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,599
We're both sleeping with him.

439
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,306
We're both sleeping with Martin.

440
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,568
And if I'm cool with that,

441
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,441
then...

442
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,710
To new beginnings.

443
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:08,148
So I'm totally psyched.
We're gonna go see Bryan Metro

444
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,345
at the Greek tomorrow night.

445
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:12,519
That is, if Graham remembered
to get the tickets.

446
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:15,387
Yeah, I got the tickets,
and stop saying "totally."

447
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:18,427
- Who'd you get them from?
- Actually, honey, from me.

448
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,520
- Through the studio.
- Good.

449
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:22,989
I'm glad he didn't go through Martin.

450
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,067
I didn't want to go through Martin,

451
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,033
even though
he could have gotten us backstage.

452
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:30,539
Who cares? He's such a stoner.
He's so into himself.

453
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:33,940
Him and his totally grody tan
and his stupid hair.

454
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,337
Plus, Mom, get this. He's a male prostitute.

455
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:41,549
- Why did you direct that statement to me?
- Just mellow out, okay?

456
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,620
I don't even know
why we're talking about Martin.

457
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:47,521
And Mom, Martin's not a male prostitute.
That's on the record.

458
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,623
Why do you think I would care?

459
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:52,127
Martin is coming to the show
with me and Christie,

460
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,356
so I hope you get over
how, "like, totally grody"

461
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,092
you think he is by tomorrow night.

462
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,296
I hope your girlfriend remembers
to wear a shirt by tomorrow night.

463
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:02,999
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the restroom.

464
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:07,203
And hopefully, when I get back,
my lovely children

465
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:11,213
will have finished their conversation
about their delightful friends.

466
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,358
Hi, honey.

467
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,964
You're here with her, aren't you?

468
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,762
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.

469
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:37,835
No, don't.

470
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,205
Sweetie, I know you're pissed.
I understand, I understand.

471
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,607
But I missed you. I couldn't help it.

472
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,839
- I can't do this.
- You can't do what?

473
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,814
You don't want me anymore?
Sweetie, I want you so bad.

474
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:49,112
That's not the point, William.

475
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:53,688
I can't sit here again
and listen to you quote numbers

476
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:57,124
about how expensive your fucking divorce
is gonna be.

477
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:01,127
Is it not enough that you've made
everyone fucking miserable?

478
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,895
Just stay away.

479
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:06,796
Please.

480
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:18,737
You know, I kept the condo.
I haven't given it up yet.

481
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:23,682
We could meet there tomorrow night.
What do you say?

482
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,884
Or I got the Piper Cub back.

483
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:31,984
It's at the hangar. It's ready to go.
We could fly to Vegas and stay at Caesars.

484
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,723
- lt'll be amazing.
- My God, William,

485
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,458
I'm not going to Vegas with you.

486
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,697
Well, at least you're going to be
at the Brodkey benefit Friday, right?

487
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:44,103
We could talk there. Okay?

488
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,266
Sure.

489
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,240
- Why not?
- Great, honey. That's what I want to hear.

490
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:51,541
It's so good to see your face.

491
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,408
We'll figure it out. It'll be okay.

492
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,215
- Yeah.
- Anyway, I better go. Okay?

493
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,320
Fuck!

494
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:58,145
Laura, are we going
to the Brodkey benefit on Friday?

495
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:04,187
Why would we go to the Brodkey benefit
on Friday night?

496
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:06,252
That's TV.

497
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,750
It's not only TV.

498
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,324
And it should be fun.

499
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:18,294
- Besides that, it's for a good cause.
- It's for a perfume, William.

500
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:23,172
I don't want to go to the Brodkey benefit
Friday night.

501
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,708
What would you like to do instead?

502
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:29,338
Sleep?

503
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,205
Lay by the pool?

504
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,881
Maybe count your shoes?

505
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:44,416
Can Daddy borrow $4,000?

506
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,930
What the fuck are you still doing here?

507
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:56,664
I thought I told you to go.

508
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:00,569
What? Are you gonna fucking ignore me?

509
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,358
What the fuck's going on?

510
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,679
What the fuck are you doing, Peter?
What the fuck did you do?

511
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,117
Answer me, God damn it!

512
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,460
Shut your mouth, Jack.

513
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,233
What the fuck?

514
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:01,568
The kid's gonna bring us some money.
That's the plan.

515
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:05,401
That's the plan I informed you about.
This is the plan.

516
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:08,535
Your fucking plan
is goddamn holding a kid ransom?

517
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:12,547
It's not me, Jack.
It's them freaks I met out in West LA.

518
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,842
The people I heard about out in Barstow.

519
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:18,353
They pay $6,000, $7,000 a pop
for a package like that.

520
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:20,556
You make me fucking sick.

521
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:35,432
Hey, man, you need to relax.
That's your problem, Jackson.

522
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,530
You don't know how to kick back.

523
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,439
Even when you was a kid out in the desert,

524
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:47,472
and all there was
was the sand and the rock and the silence,

525
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:52,387
you could never accept the fact
that that's where you belong,

526
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:56,119
and that's where you're always gonna be.

527
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,028
That was a long time ago.

528
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:03,689
And we're not
in the fucking desert anymore, Uncle Pete.

529
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,633
I think we still are.

530
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,811
- Hello?
- ls Martin there?

531
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,344
I don't know. Let me check.

532
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:32,921
Couldn't find him.

533
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,392
Do you know where he might be?

534
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,693
Have you tried his place in Westwood?

535
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:40,793
- No, I haven't.
- He could be there,

536
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:44,032
or he could be finishing up that music video
on the hills.

537
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:47,972
- ls this Julie?
- Julie?

538
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:52,675
Yeah. The girl Martin picked up
at 385 North? With the white rabbit?

539
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:56,509
We all went back to my place
and partied with Graham?

540
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,679
You and Martin disappeared?

541
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:00,448
Hello?

542
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,486
No. This isn't her. I'll call back.

543
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:25,405
Fuck me. Cut. Cut!

544
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:30,051
What the fuck are you doing, dude?
I can't see shit.

545
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:32,553
- Hey, Graham.
- Yes, totally fucking excellent.

546
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:35,819
Perfect timing, dude.
We are so in need of your services.

547
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,326
Wait, hold on a second, Leon.
We really have to get this shot.

548
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,690
The video doesn't make sense without it.

549
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:42,060
It's a fucking video, Martin.
It doesn't need to make sense.

550
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:44,861
It just needs to be not lame.

551
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:47,093
Graham, you got us covered?

552
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:50,173
- Yeah, man, you're all set.
- Totally excellent.

553
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:53,802
Hey, hey, hey.
Isn't Christie supposed to be here?

554
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,468
I thought she was supposed to be the star.

555
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:58,514
I did, too. But she's a little unreliable.

556
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:01,111
Maybe you realize that now?

557
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,618
So, where are you staying tonight?

558
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,778
Probably at Nina's, in Malibu.

559
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:08,084
- Who's Nina?
- Nina. Nina Metro.

560
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,320
- Bryan Metro's wife?
- Ex- wife.

561
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,590
Christ.

562
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:15,923
Where are you staying?

563
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:18,227
Honestly, Martin, I don't know
how I feel about the situation anymore.

564
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:21,065
I think I'm just gonna crash at my mom's.

565
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:24,504
- Look, I've got eight more shots.
- Yeah. You're busy.

566
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:26,867
Can we shoot this, you fucking cokeheads?

567
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:50,190
Hey, Tim, why don't you get your old man
another mai tai?

568
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:58,040
- Hey.
- What?

569
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:01,668
Why don't you get your dad
and yourself a drink?

570
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:05,574
- What do you want?
- Mai tai.

571
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:12,646
Okay.

572
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,457
What are you up to?

573
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,356
Met a girl from San Diego.

574
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:35,270
Hey, come on.

575
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,343
- Hey, Cheryl. Nice to see you.
- Hi.

576
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:51,886
- How are you, sweetie?
- Good.

577
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,512
I just wanted to grab
a quick salad or something.

578
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,592
- Do you have anything open?
- Sure. Let me see.

579
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:06,966
Excuse me.

580
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:16,670
Shit!

581
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,814
Fuck you, you fucking asshole!

582
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:06,388
- Hi.
- Hi.

583
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,191
What would you like, hun?

584
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:10,823
A garden salad and a glass of water, please.

585
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:11,992
Okay.

586
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:15,736
- You're Cheryl Moore, right?
- Yeah.

587
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:17,736
- I think you're great, honey.
- Thank you.

588
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:21,242
The piece you did
on the anniversary of Sharon Tate.

589
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:24,812
I remember when that happened.
It was so awful.

590
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:26,905
- Yeah.
- lt was just so sad.

591
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,081
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

592
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:33,952
All right.

593
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:42,989
Hey! Aren't you on the news or something?

594
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,067
- Yes.
- You're Cheryl Moore, right?

595
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:47,534
- Yeah. Do you have a light?
- Sure.

596
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:50,367
Listen...

597
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:53,832
Can I have your autograph?

598
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:57,743
'Cause I am, like, your biggest fan.

599
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:01,843
There you go.

600
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,249
Thanks a lot, Cher. By the way,

601
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:07,647
we're opening for Bryan Metro
at the Greek tonight.

602
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,190
You wanna go?

603
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,123
You know, I really don't think I can.

604
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,695
Got it. Thanks a lot, Cheryl.

605
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:27,676
Hello?

606
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:30,405
What's going on? How are you?

607
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,775
How did you get this number?

608
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,788
Did Roger give it to you?

609
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:43,586
Could I just speak to Jamie, please?

610
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:46,293
Well, he can't right now. He's...

611
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:49,991
- He's on the beach with a friend.
- Who?

612
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:53,894
A friend of his or a friend of yours?

613
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:59,735
You know, that's just great, Nina.
That's great.

614
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:02,209
Can we... Can we just get this over with?

615
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,679
Can I just speak to my kid this time
without having to freak out? Please?

616
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:09,183
You know you don't even have
visitation rights, Bryan.

617
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:11,384
Just put him on the phone, Nina.

618
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,581
No, I mean, I don't even know
why you want me to say this...

619
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,453
Just tell whoever you're fucking

620
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:17,526
to bring my kid out
and put him on the phone!

621
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:20,460
Okay. No. You know what, Bryan?
I'm going to hang up now.

622
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:23,498
Just because I don't have visitation rights

623
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,034
does not mean
I'm not allowed to talk to my kid.

624
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:29,229
Now, if you want me to call my lawyers,
Nina, I'll call my fucking lawyers!

625
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,330
Fuck your fucking lawyers, Bryan!

626
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:33,204
- I'll call my fucking lawyers.
- Fuck them!

627
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,710
Fuck, all right, Nina, look, I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

628
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:39,281
Please, Nina.
I don't mean to shout. I just...

629
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:44,115
Bryan, listen to me.
Don't you fucking call me or him ever again.

630
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,279
He's fucking afraid of you!

631
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:48,589
Fucking afraid of me?

632
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:51,558
And don't fucking... You...
What about you, you Medusa?

633
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:53,288
You fucking Medusa!

634
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:10,008
- Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan!
- Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan!

635
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:13,344
- Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan!
- Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan!

636
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:16,976
- Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan!
- Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan!

637
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:44,666
Good evening, sir.

638
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:48,133
Surprised?

639
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:04,112
Do you want to know who I am?

640
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:08,556
Are you from around here?

641
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:12,754
Not really. I'm actually from Nebraska.
A little town near Lincoln.

642
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,775
You had a job at the mall, right?

643
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:31,743
But the mall closed down, right?

644
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:36,951
It's all empty now, huh?

645
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,217
Have you been there?

646
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,989
I've been to a mall in Nebraska.

647
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,563
It's all flat.

648
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:53,625
It's all totally, totally

649
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:56,062
flat.

650
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:01,173
Come here.

651
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:36,928
Clear the area.

652
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:40,135
All of these vehicles need to be moved.

653
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,101
What's going on?

654
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:44,713
You scared me.

655
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:50,047
I don't know. I guess some guy's
like threatening to shoot his wife

656
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:53,253
or maybe he shot her or something.

657
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:55,553
They got the SWAT team out there
and everything, man.

658
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:59,150
- lf I were you, I wouldn't go out there.
- Yeah, I won't.

659
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:03,732
So you're on the eleventh floor, right?

660
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,859
Yeah, the guy who does the videos
visits you all the time.

661
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:10,302
You mean Martin.
It's actually my girlfriend's place.

662
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,935
- I'm Graham.
- Yeah, I know who you are.

663
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:17,437
- You want a cigarette?
- Yeah.

664
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:33,588
It's...

665
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:39,961
It's kind of a small world,
'cause the guy who raised me out here?

666
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:45,601
He used to work at the studio your dad runs.
You know, so he was part of the system.

667
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:50,005
But I guess they had to let him go.

668
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:54,574
Something happened
with some actress or something,

669
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:57,551
and then he kind of had a breakdown,

670
01:05:57,653 --> 01:05:59,712
so we went back to Barstow.

671
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:02,320
But I came back here,

672
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:05,955
'cause I'm an actor.

673
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,824
I was in a commercial for gum,

674
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:13,162
and I was the boyfriend
in a Clearasil commercial.

675
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:25,078
You know, it's just kind of hard
'cause you can't really make it in this town

676
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:28,514
unless you're really willing
to do some awful things.

677
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:33,112
And, you know, I'm willing.

678
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:37,582
- Yeah, I guess.
- But I really want to get into video.

679
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:41,220
That's why I was thinking that Mark guy
would be a great contact.

680
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,695
It's Martin.

681
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:54,740
All right. Well, thanks for the...

682
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:58,477
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Yeah.

683
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:04,314
Hey, where you going?

684
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:10,684
I've got to drink some juice
and then get some sleep.

685
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:17,031
You sure you don't want to stay?
I could really use the company.

686
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:18,760
Sorry, I gotta go.

687
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:24,537
I think something's gonna happen.

688
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:30,070
Les Price for two at 8:00.

689
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,639
It's actually three.

690
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:37,446
- I asked Rachel.
- Who's Rachel?

691
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:40,253
The girl I met on the beach today.

692
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:43,152
And when were you going to tell me this?

693
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,119
I don't know. Now, I guess.

694
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:49,155
I didn't think it would be a problem.

695
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:51,099
I mean, is it?

696
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,226
Well, I guess there's going
to be three of us.

697
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:56,864
- Hey, Tim.
- Hey, how are you?

698
01:07:57,673 --> 01:07:59,140
Good, thanks.

699
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:02,804
Rachel, this is my dad, Les Price.

700
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,107
- Hi, Mr. Price.
- Hello, Rachel.

701
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,642
You here in Hawaii on your own?

702
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,548
No, but my parents are in Maui tonight.

703
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,847
So... You both look nice.

704
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:17,424
- Thanks, you look great.
- Yes. You do.

705
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:22,463
So what did you two do
after the beach today?

706
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:26,396
Well, I watched Tim perfect his hair
for two hours,

707
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:31,296
then spend another two hours
choosing which shirt he's gonna wear.

708
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:34,104
Now I understand why.

709
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:40,982
So did anybody see
that Robert Waters is here?

710
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:44,448
- Who's that?
- Come on, Tim. Robert Waters.

711
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:47,412
Star of The Flight Patrol.

712
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:49,888
It's a television show.

713
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,327
On television.

714
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:56,460
I don't know.
I guess I just must not watch enough TV.

715
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:57,827
Yeah, right.

716
01:08:57,933 --> 01:09:00,902
Wait. You don't know who Robert Waters is?

717
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:03,869
No, I don't.

718
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:08,103
- You do, I guess?
- Well, I met him at Reagan's inauguration.

719
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:11,508
God, I thought everybody knew
who Robert Waters is.

720
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:15,210
I don't.

721
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:19,181
- Why do you guys care?
- Well, it's a little weird.

722
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:22,350
- Why?
- He's here with three guys.

723
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:29,691
The very macho star of Flight Patrol
is here with three dudes.

724
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,321
So?

725
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:34,231
So one of them tried to pick up Tim today.

726
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:35,734
Me? When?

727
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,204
At the beach. Today at the bar.

728
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:41,474
- That guy?
- Yeah. That guy.

729
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:46,277
Look, he was nice. He was a nice guy.

730
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,915
Yeah, I'm sure he was really nice.

731
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:50,582
Real nice.

732
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,024
You smoke?

733
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:08,228
- I told you, Tim.
- What?

734
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:12,403
- It's bad for you.
- He knows. I told him last night.

735
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,144
Am I blowing this in your face?

736
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:23,575
I mean, really?
Is this actually bothering you?

737
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:26,712
I mean, we're outside.

738
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:29,313
Look, you just shouldn't smoke, Tim.

739
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,019
Okay.

740
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:35,722
I'm gonna go finish this cigarette
somewhere else,

741
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:37,924
since you two don't like it.

742
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:43,567
The odds looking pretty good tonight, Dad?

743
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:48,672
- Tim, stop.
- Let him go.

744
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:53,978
Well, thank you for dinner, Les.

745
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:57,450
- Hey. Hey. We're not done here.
- No, look, just tell Tim that I'm sorry.

746
01:10:57,553 --> 01:10:59,953
Let's have another drink. Come on.

747
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:01,682
You know, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

748
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:04,452
Don't let him spoil the party. Come on.

749
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:06,956
We're not going to another shitty party

750
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:09,428
just because
you're fucking the hostess, okay?

751
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:12,398
And she's married, and her husband's there.

752
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:15,936
I mean, you'll honestly fuck anybody, right?

753
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,634
I fucked you, dude.

754
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:22,268
Nice.

755
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:29,309
Where the fuck was Christie tonight?
Wasn't she supposed to be at the party?

756
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:33,186
Christ, I guess I forgot to tell you.
She hasn't been feeling too well.

757
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,984
She had to stay in.

758
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:41,962
- Wait, are you staying at her place?
- No. She moved in with me and Nina.

759
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,634
- Nina... Nina Metro, out in the colony?
- Yeah.

760
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,668
- Since when?
- It's been a couple of days.

761
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:57,081
It's weird, she has these night sweats

762
01:11:57,082 --> 01:12:00,173
and swollen glands and this weird rash

763
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:03,683
- and these little purple bruises...
- Wait, she's sick?

764
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,647
Yeah. She wanted to get out of the condo
and hang at the beach.

765
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:09,121
She said she'd feel better there.

766
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:18,458
Martin, I need to know something.

767
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:26,367
Are you and Christie, like, fucking around?
You guys fuck around when I'm not there?

768
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:28,705
No. No.

769
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:33,705
I wouldn't do that to you.

770
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,414
Holy shit. You...

771
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:43,949
Wow. You really, really like her, don't you?

772
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:47,825
This isn't just a thing for you.
You actually care about her.

773
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:52,391
- I need something, Martin.
- You need some fucking ludes.

774
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:54,992
No, I need something more than this!

775
01:12:56,772 --> 01:13:00,264
Graham, what else is there?
You already have everything.

776
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:06,938
I need someone to tell me what is good.

777
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:12,544
Okay? And I need someone
to tell me what's bad.

778
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:16,923
Because if nobody
tells you these things, Martin,

779
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:20,085
then how do you know
what's good and what's bad?

780
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:24,426
And then what happens?
What happens...

781
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:27,967
What happens then,
when nobody tells you these things?

782
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:08,941
- Can I help you?
- Hi, I'm Dirk. Who are you?

783
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:13,311
- Nobody. What the fuck do you want?
- I'm looking for someone.

784
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:19,176
- Well, I'm the only one here, so...
- But I have something to pick up here.

785
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:22,989
I think you've probably got the wrong house.

786
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:26,694
Where's Peter?

787
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,530
- He's not here.
- Dude, a deal was made.

788
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:33,100
Now I don't know who you are,

789
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:35,961
but there's something here
that now belongs to us.

790
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:40,633
Look, I don't want any trouble,
so I think you should just leave, all right?

791
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:44,740
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, all right?

792
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:48,783
- You got the wrong place.
- No. This is the right place.

793
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,417
The fuck are you looking at?

794
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:02,029
Look, I told you, Peter's not here.

795
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:07,962
And I don't know anything
about what the fuck you're talking about.

796
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:11,505
- I'm just really tired.
- This is very important,

797
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:14,167
so think carefully before you answer.

798
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:17,168
Tell me where the fuck Peter is.

799
01:15:17,369 --> 01:15:19,643
I can't tell you that,
'cause I don't know.

800
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:23,377
This is simple. Peter was paid.
We want what we paid for.

801
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:27,346
- Now where is it?
- I swear to God, I don't know.

802
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:30,453
Well, you better find out because

803
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:33,084
he will be in a very dark place
if we become disappointed,

804
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,789
and we're becoming extremely disappointed.

805
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:38,560
As soon as he gets back, I'll tell him.

806
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:41,429
I just don't know when that's gonna be.

807
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:53,542
I'll see you again.

808
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:03,322
Laura. I...

809
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:06,984
I need a shot,
and I couldn't find any syringes anywhere.

810
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:09,859
I mean, with the move and everything.
You don't have any, do you?

811
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:11,728
I've got one in here.

812
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:58,170
I saw her, William.
I saw her at the restaurant.

813
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:01,843
- You saw who?
- Don't make me say her fucking name.

814
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:06,253
- What are you talking about?
- Just go get dressed.

815
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:08,755
I'm not gonna have this conversation
with you if you're going to lie.

816
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:12,293
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it anymore!

817
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:19,830
If you want to talk to me,
you're going to tell me the truth!

818
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:25,168
- Yeah, I want to talk to you.
- The other night at dinner.

819
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:27,173
When you came back
and you sat down at the table

820
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:31,075
and you said the Brodkeys' benefit.
I know why you want to go.

821
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,645
I know why you want to go.
Do you think I'm an idiot?

822
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:37,014
- No.
- You know what I do wonder?

823
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:41,215
If you still have feelings for her,
then why are you in this house?

824
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:44,255
Why are you still in this house?

825
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,523
Are you that selfish?

826
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:49,030
To think that I would stay here with you
while you fucked her?

827
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:50,530
Is that what you're thinking?

828
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:52,725
Do you ever think about anybody else
but yourself?

829
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:56,429
Do you ever think about me?
Do you ever think about your children?

830
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:58,631
- Our children.
- Our children!

831
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:01,766
You did this for our children? For Graham?

832
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:05,879
He's in college. He deals drugs.
And he thinks you're a joke.

833
01:18:06,114 --> 01:18:09,174
- And Susan? Susan loathes you!
- That's not true.

834
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:11,411
Yes, that is very true!

835
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:16,721
For one time,
for one time in your goddamned life,

836
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,918
be honest with me, William.

837
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:22,392
Did you ever love me?

838
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:25,194
Did you ever love me?

839
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:29,100
- Tell me, did you ever love me...
- I don't know. I don't know.

840
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:31,037
I don't know.

841
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:42,082
You were afraid you'd be lonely, is that it?

842
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:49,046
You were afraid you'd have to give me 50%
of everything you think you own, is that it?

843
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:51,591
No. That's not what this is about.

844
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:54,353
God.

845
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:00,062
Oh, God.

846
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:21,619
I'll go to the benefit with you.

847
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:24,389
And we'll walk in there

848
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:28,525
and we'll wink and we'll wave
and we'll have drinks,

849
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:31,866
and we'll let everybody
know we're just fine.

850
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:36,326
And then you can come back home here

851
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:40,064
and you can pack your things
and you can leave.

852
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:43,869
So, yes,
I'll go to the Brodkey benefit with you.

853
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:49,510
Why would you want to do that?

854
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,847
I want to see her.

855
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:57,949
Hey!

856
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:01,051
Where you been?

857
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:05,022
You weren't in the room.

858
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:09,293
Tim, what's wrong? What happened?

859
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:12,563
What's wrong? Nothing's wrong.

860
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:18,036
You want to talk?

861
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:25,484
Did you just ask me if I want to talk?

862
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:27,248
Well, yeah.

863
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:29,985
Yeah. We could talk.

864
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:36,293
What? What are we gonna talk about, Dad?

865
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:40,033
I don't know. You tell me.

866
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:44,836
There's nothing to talk about.

867
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:47,204
Please... Please, Tim, come on.

868
01:20:47,309 --> 01:20:49,504
There's nothing to talk about.

869
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,169
Come on. Give me a chance.

870
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:55,473
Don't ruin my chances.

871
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:58,553
You don't have any chances left
to ruin, dude.

872
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:05,524
Come on, Tim, you don't mean that.

873
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:11,322
There's nothing.

874
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,768
There's nothing. Just accept it.

875
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:18,297
It's easier that way. Just forget it.

876
01:21:19,774 --> 01:21:22,072
There's nothing you can tell me,

877
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:24,903
and there's nothing
I'm going to tell you, Dad,

878
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:27,379
that's gonna make any difference.

879
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:51,634
Some fucking blond kid came by the house.

880
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:53,804
Yeah, what did he say?

881
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:56,839
- He was asking me about a package.
- Yeah?

882
01:21:56,945 --> 01:21:58,810
Did you give it to him?

883
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,446
No, I told him we didn't have it.

884
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:06,611
What?

885
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:11,856
- What did Dirk say?
- What? You know his fucking name?

886
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:19,032
What did Dirk say, Jack?

887
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:23,562
- He said he'd be back.
- Fuck!

888
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:26,971
They're gonna kill us!
They're gonna kill us!

889
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:28,201
Who the fuck are these people?

890
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:30,835
I think it would be in our best interest
if you get your shit

891
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,345
and we get the fuck out of here, okay?

892
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:34,642
I told you.
I told you we shouldn't have come here.

893
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:36,114
Shut the fuck up, Mary!

894
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:37,946
Just get your shit
and let's get out of here, okay?

895
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:39,520
No, it's not my fucking problem.

896
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:42,112
I got a fucking job.
I can't just fucking pack up and move.

897
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:45,056
You don't know
what they're capable of, okay?

898
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:49,392
You ain't got a goddamn clue.
They're like out of a fucking nightmare.

899
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:52,967
So get your shit together
and let's get the fuck out of here.

900
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:54,535
Come on, Mary!

901
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,023
What are you doing?

902
01:23:24,866 --> 01:23:28,597
Listen, if we leave the kid here
and they find him,

903
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:34,138
this is a more humane way
than letting them get their hands on him.

904
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:36,142
Let me do it.

905
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,838
Let you do what?

906
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:45,409
- Let you do what?
- I'll handle it.

907
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:47,880
How are you gonna handle it?

908
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:51,923
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

909
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:55,486
Get the fucking van ready.

910
01:23:59,234 --> 01:24:00,701
Come on, Mary.

911
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:57,479
- Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan!
- Bryan! Bryan! Bryan! Bryan!

912
01:26:43,464 --> 01:26:46,661
Clean yourself. Just clean yourself up.

913
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:28,807
- Hello?
- Yes, hello, I'm looking for Graham.

914
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:31,872
- Yeah?
- Graham, it's Nina Metro.

915
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,743
- I'm calling about...
- Who?

916
01:27:33,848 --> 01:27:36,817
We've actually got an emergency
with Christie.

917
01:27:36,951 --> 01:27:39,317
I was hoping you could come down.

918
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:02,036
- Hello, can I help you?
- Hi.

919
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:08,444
- I'm Graham.
- You're Graham?

920
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:09,874
Yeah.

921
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:13,713
She's really sick.

922
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:18,483
She needs to see a doctor, but she's
so stubborn, we can't talk her into it.

923
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:24,492
- Well, where's her dad?
- He's on location in ltaly.

924
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:31,203
- That's an answer?
- She needs help, Graham.

925
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:37,271
- Why do you think I can help her?
- Well, aren't you the one that loves her?

926
01:28:44,919 --> 01:28:46,750
What's that gonna fix?

927
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:49,954
Is that gonna help her?

928
01:29:10,745 --> 01:29:11,769
Hey.

929
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:26,624
What are you trying to tell me, baby?
What are you saying?

930
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:31,693
I want...

931
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:36,125
I want to stay.

932
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:41,338
But it's getting cold.

933
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:44,239
But I need more sun.

934
01:29:55,823 --> 01:29:57,552
There's no more sun.
