1
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,034
"Amazing Grace"

2
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:34,713
Excuse me?

3
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,381
My grandmother sang that song to me.

4
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,707
That's real nice.

5
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:43,854
I especially like the part that goes,
"I once was lost, but now I'm found."

6
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,386
Take you, for instance. You must be
a fool to roll up in here, man.

7
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,096
But I figure you must be lost.

8
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:55,300
So I tell you what. See this here?
This is for your bill.

9
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:56,826
And...

10
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,767
...since you look like
such a jovial individual...

11
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:01,996
...here's the tip.

12
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,170
So "find" your ass out of here.

13
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,840
We haven't finished our drinks.

14
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,401
You finished now?

15
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:39,509
Let it go, Po.

16
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,505
This is a hassle we don't need.

17
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,920
And don't come back, zipperhead.

18
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,822
Po, get them out of here!

19
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,194
Now.

20
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,468
Let's go.

21
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,713
Guess you wanna gamble
with your life.

22
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,471
Casino's as good a place as any.

23
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,121
Guess I could use a little exercise.

24
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,185
Guns don't kill people.

25
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:34,918
People kill people.

26
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,360
For example,
these two guys with the machine guns.

27
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,430
lf they start blasting off...

28
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,928
...ain't none of y'all going home!

29
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:49,099
You guys are disturbing my business.
So if your ass ain't black...

30
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:52,311
...you'd better get up out of here
before it really get hot!

31
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,660
Let's go.

32
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,561
Ladies, excuse us, please.

33
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,668
- What are you doing, Kai?
- Get them out.

34
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,736
- You too.
- No. Stay.

35
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,305
You too, please.

36
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,602
What were you doing?
We're in a damn war.

37
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,437
I'm a big boy now.

38
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,681
These black guys'll bury you.

39
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,177
You work for me, Kai.

40
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,542
I work for your father.

41
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,877
Get your head out of your ass, Po.

42
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,487
As long as there's a war going on,
you're my responsibility.

43
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,882
I can take care of myself.

44
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,913
Oh, my God.

45
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,757
Tiger, you killing me, man.
I hate this game.

46
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:53,989
lsaak!

47
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,254
You have a phone call.

48
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,096
I'll take it in the house.

49
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,359
I need a break anyway.

50
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,125
I don't even know why
you stressing it, man.

51
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:07,130
You know why I'm stressing.
All future business deals...

52
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:11,867
...will take place not in the pool
hall, but in somebody's country club.

53
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,510
You know that.

54
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,971
lsaak, if you're serious
about going straight...

55
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,683
...I wanna know if you got a plan
for old Mac.

56
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:22,652
Or should I start looking at the
classifieds?

57
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,551
As long as I'm breathing...

58
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,953
...you ain't ever got to worry about
no classifieds.

59
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:32,688
Come on, boy.

60
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,524
You know it's me and you.

61
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,606
Hey, what you got for me?

62
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,566
You sure about that?

63
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,877
What's wrong?

64
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,283
What's wrong, man?

65
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,718
Somebody canceled Ch'u's boy.

66
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:00,758
You set up a meeting with Ch'u ASAP,
then find out who killed his boy.

67
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,921
Don't even sweat it, okay?
I got it.

68
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,313
Mr. O'Day.

69
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,344
Mr. Sing's at gate B- 1 2.

70
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:04,781
Thank you.

71
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,333
Nice touch on the metal detectors.

72
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,536
Keeps everybody honest, my man.

73
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,747
You have my deepest condolences.

74
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,454
Thank you.

75
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,083
What happened to your son
was tragic, Mr. Sing.

76
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:43,461
Very unnecessary.

77
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,631
I want you to know I'll be
looking into this personally.

78
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:51,432
You will forgive me
if I'm not easily moved.

79
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,205
Mr. Sing...

80
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,399
...with all due respect,
there is no way...

81
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,406
...anybody in my camp would touch
your family...

82
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:05,149
...any more than anybody in your camp
would touch mine.

83
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,509
It just wouldn't happen.

84
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,688
Our business venture will continue.

85
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,326
I'm pleased to hear that.

86
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:43,384
Make sure we got 24- hour security
for my son and daughter.

87
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,489
It's all been arranged, chief.

88
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,054
Make those lemon tarts for the kids,
okay?

89
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,895
I need to get a signature from you.

90
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:57,532
All right, thanks.

91
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,532
- You're welcome, dear.
- Excuse me.

92
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,467
- Do you have this in a small?
- One minute. Amy.

93
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,903
Help her out for me.
She'll help you.

94
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:10,312
- What are y'all doing?
- You got a little something- something?

95
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,046
Girl, tell him to turn up the music,
okay?

96
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,886
Break it on down!

97
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,752
Show them how we used to do it.

98
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,495
Watch the store for me, okay?

99
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,206
Oh, shit.

100
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:43,640
What a name for a store:
Serpentine Fire.

101
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,977
That's tight. It's real tight.

102
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,243
Kool and the Gang jam from
back in the day, right?

103
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,284
Earth, Wind and Fire.

104
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,450
That serious shit.

105
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:54,924
Do I know you?

106
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,122
How you gonna play me like that?

107
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,694
You know I work for your pops.

108
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,799
- Right. Your name starts with an "M."
- Yeah, that's it.

109
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,226
Moron.

110
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,698
Funny. It's Maurice, all right?

111
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:12,170
I'd love to reminisce with you,
but I'm busy right now...

112
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,038
...so let's do this later, okay?

113
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:15,639
It don't work like that.

114
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,905
Excuse me?

115
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,379
Your father could be
catching some static...

116
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,676
...and Mac wants me
to watch your back.

117
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:22,978
Let me tell you something.

118
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:27,658
Whatever my father and Mac are into
has nothing to do with me.

119
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,793
You can hate them all you want.
That's your business.

120
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,726
lf they tell me not to let you out of
my sight, you can go to confession...

121
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,334
...and it's going to be you,
me and the priest.

122
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:39,468
That's ridiculous.

123
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,900
Look. My ride's right over there.

124
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,774
Back seat or the trunk.
Make it easy on yourself.

125
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,739
Your choice, baby girl.

126
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,706
Waiting for the magic word.

127
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,041
Please.

128
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,723
Stuck- up.

129
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,050
I got some coloring books
in the back.

130
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,090
- You think you're funny.
- I'm babysitting.

131
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,354
I gotta bring something
for the kids.

132
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,724
Can I get my leg in the car?

133
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,199
Damn!

134
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,850
The NFL announced Friday
that Oakland...

135
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,751
...will become home
to its newest expansion team.

136
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:37,325
The question of who the new owners
will be is still unresolved.

137
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,689
For more we go to Jody Vance.

138
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,091
That's right, Perry.

139
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,996
Several groups of investors will be
presenting proposals this week.

140
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:49,833
I thought we were done with football
when the Raiders left town.

141
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,474
- Yeah, well, jobs.
- What?

142
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,646
Jobs. See, if they have to build
another stadium...

143
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,906
...some of us that have been less
fortunate can attain jobs.

144
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:03,553
Harold, your unfortunate ass been
sitting in that chair for 1 5 years.

145
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,417
You couldn't attain a job if one
bit you in the butt.

146
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,319
You think you're funny, don't you?

147
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,419
Got a package for you.

148
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,697
I'm laughing because
you think you're funny.

149
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,259
Thanks.

150
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,936
You want a job, Harold?
Open this damn box.

151
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,799
Well, lookie, lookie.

152
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,234
Who sent you a present?

153
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,067
I don't know.
Probably your wife.

154
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,538
There you go again.

155
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,364
Thank you.

156
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,017
- Excuse me.
- Off duty.

157
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,347
Can you take me here?

158
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,716
Can't you understand English?

159
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,392
Two words: off duty.

160
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,350
How you doing?

161
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,844
How you doing?!

162
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,024
This shit tight, huh?

163
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,354
This shit's tight.
Girl, what's your name?

164
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,194
I said what's your name?!

165
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,526
What? You don't like a big man?
You not knowing.

166
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,232
- What's up, Alonso?
- Trish, what's up?

167
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,376
- Just chilling. Getting some albums.
- That's it today?

168
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,609
- You want this on your tab?
- Yeah, please.

169
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,948
Thank you.

170
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,114
This is my shit!

171
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,421
Shit!

172
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:29,065
This is my shit right here!
I got something for you right now.

173
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,099
My bad.

174
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,405
Shit!

175
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,513
Thank goodness. Just drive.

176
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,314
Two words: off duty.

177
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,255
You know what?

178
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,585
Jesus.

179
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,193
Two words for you, buddy:
on duty, 50 bucks.

180
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,058
I'm gonna find you!
I know where you work at!

181
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,170
Please, just do me a favor
and get me out of here.

182
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,107
Who's that?

183
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,674
Nobody.

184
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,188
Where did you learn to drive?

185
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,357
Ahkbar?

186
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:31,959
Hong Kong.

187
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,398
You gonna start the meter?

188
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,883
You steal a lot of cabs
in Hong Kong?

189
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:54,578
You want me to pull over?

190
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:58,152
No, no. Just...turn here.

191
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,957
So, Ahkbar, tell me. ls it true what
they say about Hong Kong?

192
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:06,896
What's that?

193
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,463
All you guys do kung fu.

194
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,859
Of course.

195
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,090
State law.

196
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:14,070
Can you break a board with your head?

197
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,432
Sure.

198
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,274
That I'd have to see.
You must be a very dangerous man.

199
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:20,934
Are you scared?

200
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,745
Don't take this personal...

201
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,315
...but I've been around more
dangerous guys than you.

202
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,079
Right here's fine.

203
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:35,958
No charge.

204
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,126
Keep it. I won't call the cops.

205
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:39,830
I don't want your money.

206
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,429
You seem like a nice guy.

207
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,466
I am.

208
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:50,639
You should find a new profession.
Stealing cars doesn't fit you.

209
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,274
What's your name?

210
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:54,842
You think I want you calling me?

211
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,172
I don't have a phone.

212
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,381
Well, dead giveaway.

213
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,845
Besides, you drive like shit.

214
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,405
How are those acquisitions
coming along?

215
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,617
Progressing real nice, man.

216
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:36,047
I just have three more deeds
to get signed over.

217
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,381
Let me be clear.
You don't play around with the NFL.

218
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:43,321
It's their America, and their deadline
is progressing in less than a week.

219
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:44,858
I know.

220
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,432
You gotta remember something,
Mr. Roth.

221
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,102
These people have owned them stores
for over 30 years.

222
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:56,935
So what if they need a couple more
days to mull over their decision?

223
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,713
These are tense times right now.
You know what I mean?

224
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:13,723
Shit.

225
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,652
You're murdering yourself.

226
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,625
Golf is a game of finesse,
not power.

227
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,693
ln that way,
it's much like the rest of life.

228
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:27,697
The key is letting the body
work together.

229
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,038
You want to get a good turn
so the wrist breaks naturally.

230
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,212
Make sure you keep your eyes
on the ball.

231
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:46,613
This shaft, I don't like it.
It ain't working for me.

232
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,756
Save the excuses.

233
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:53,191
With all respect to the shop owners,
without the deeds, there's no deal.

234
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:57,458
Without the land deal, there's no
presentation. So there's no....

235
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,828
- What's the popular term these days?
- Cheddar.

236
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,302
That's right. No cheddar.

237
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,443
Do I make myself clear?

238
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,872
lf I say I'll deliver, I'll deliver.

239
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,374
Hey, hey, hey, now.
Sorry I'm late.

240
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:15,949
Girl, knowing the way you shop,
I'd say you're early.

241
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,121
Oh, really? Funny.
I got some hot stuff.

242
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:21,586
Good. Work it out!
Your brother's in the back.

243
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,129
You know the guy that got whacked?

244
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,059
You mean Ch'u's boy?

245
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:33,529
He called me. Ain't that some shit?
Same night he got killed, Pop.

246
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,399
Jesus Christ.

247
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,035
What'd he want, Colin?

248
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:41,336
I don't know. Oh, look, man.

249
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,103
Let me holler back at you later.

250
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,475
You be in my office in one hour.

251
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,654
I asked you not to do business here.

252
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,656
- Hi, sis. Nice to see you too.
- I mean it, Colin. Come on.

253
00:29:56,895 --> 00:30:00,956
This is my place, okay?
I got kids hanging here all the time.

254
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:04,965
- lf this is what you're about- -
- Don't start with that speech.

255
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,795
For once, let's not go there.

256
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,138
I was on the phone talking to Pop.

257
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:19,173
Look, come on. He's a businessman.
I work for this businessman.

258
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,849
Stop tripping over this shit.

259
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,520
Colin, wait.

260
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,361
Look. I'm sorry.

261
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,721
I just worry about you, okay?

262
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:34,954
That's all.

263
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,624
Yeah, I know.

264
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,996
And I love you too, Trish.

265
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:44,003
But you ain't got to worry about me.

266
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,674
I'm fine.

267
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,853
Good afternoon. Serpentine Fire.

268
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:57,834
Right there, baby.

269
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:08,310
What's good?

270
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,507
Try the parking lot.

271
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:15,719
I'm just trying to do my job, Trish.
Just like Mo.

272
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,750
He told me the shit you pulled.

273
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:19,819
Plain stupid is what it was.

274
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,858
Things are gonna get tense now that
that Chinese dude got popped.

275
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,960
- Was that one of your jobs too?
- No...

276
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,324
...that shoddy work's not my style.

277
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,293
I'm sorry. Poor baby!
Have I got you all wrong?

278
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,104
You don't have a clue
to what I'm about.

279
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,805
Why don't you tell me?

280
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:38,468
For starters,
you gotta get past the facade.

281
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,904
You got some serious
facade going on.

282
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,407
Well, so do you.
So does everybody.

283
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:47,948
And this Miss I-don't-need-nobody
isn't you. Not the real you.

284
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:52,154
- You saving yourself for Kobe Bryant?
- ls that what you think I'm doing?

285
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:57,019
I think you need to consider the
possibility that you've met him.

286
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:02,861
You're an errand boy for my father.
You're nothing.

287
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:04,766
Fair enough.

288
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:09,865
But there comes a time when a man
has to strike out on his own.

289
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,135
Stake his own claim.

290
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:13,903
How could I have missed it?

291
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,408
I think I'm hopelessly in love
with you.

292
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:20,376
Make fun all you like.
Soon I'll be way too much for you.

293
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,812
Those big brown eyes will get all
misty wishing there were two of me.

294
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,286
Fill yourself all you want.
I just lost my appetite.

295
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:29,891
Sit down.

296
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:35,225
You don't have to respect me,
but you will let us protect you.

297
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:36,864
Do you understand?

298
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,930
Do you understand?!

299
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,580
Mac, you're so smooth
with the ladies, baby.

300
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,146
lf I want Eddie Murphy,
I'll go to the goddamn movies.

301
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,321
Yeah, dog.

302
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:04,290
Good. Give him some fat- free water
or something.

303
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,427
Where my drink, man?!

304
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,931
The fuck you looking at?

305
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,634
All the way down the end there!

306
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,076
Finish telling me
about this call you got.

307
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,718
Guy calls,
says he wants to meet me.

308
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:32,688
For what?

309
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:35,525
I don't know.
We didn't talk that long.

310
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:39,488
Said he had a little something
might put a stop to this war.

311
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,527
A little something?

312
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,703
I didn't trust him,
so I said meet me at Silk's.

313
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,842
As soon as you got that call,
you should've told me.

314
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,784
Maybe next time I cross the street,
you should hold my hand.

315
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:07,423
Hey, who the hell you talking to?
I will knock the black off you, boy.

316
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:08,920
I mean no disrespect.

317
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:13,990
I'm just trying to be a man here.
I'm looking out for you.

318
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,928
I don't need you to look out for me,
Colin.

319
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,168
Have a seat.

320
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,433
Go on. Sit down.

321
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:39,747
Come on.

322
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:50,099
I've been working on a big deal.
A real big deal.

323
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:54,732
When it goes through, we're out
of this gangster nonsense for good.

324
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:58,203
Everything we do will be
strictly legit from here on out.

325
00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:59,770
What do you mean?

326
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,638
I got something else lined up
for my boy.

327
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:06,783
You will get to run with this ball.
I guarantee that.

328
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,215
But you gotta use your head.

329
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:11,716
And you gotta listen.

330
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,820
You understand what I'm saying?

331
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:16,653
Yeah, Pop.

332
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,063
Finish your drink.

333
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,464
Collard Green.

334
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,171
Black Mac.

335
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,277
Something wrong?

336
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,542
You tell me.

337
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:51,757
Hey, chief.

338
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:57,532
Hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but you need to see this.

339
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:09,134
Calvin's place?

340
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,216
He was the sweetest guy in the world.

341
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:17,720
I'd better wrap up these acquisitions
quickly for you.

342
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:21,117
Things are getting pretty crazy
around here.

343
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,062
You gonna be okay?

344
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,032
Just give me a minute.

345
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:30,892
Okay, boss.

346
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,225
That's it right over there.

347
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,887
Okay. Lock up the store.

348
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:05,633
- We're going out tonight, right?
- Definitely.

349
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,045
Follow her.

350
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:50,245
Ahkbar. What the hell
are you doing here?

351
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:51,641
I need to ask you something.

352
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:55,045
You get out of my apartment
before I call the cops.

353
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:56,115
Please.

354
00:40:56,387 --> 00:41:00,153
You're the only guy I know working
down the criminal ladder. What's up?

355
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:04,259
This is the last number my brother
called before he was murdered.

356
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:06,429
It's the number of your shop.

357
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:09,695
It is.

358
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,298
But I don't know your brother.

359
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,836
- Why would he want to talk to me?
- He called your store.

360
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,371
Yeah, but not to talk to me.

361
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:21,439
I got a girl who works the register.
It could've been her.

362
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:23,607
My brother- -

363
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:24,848
Brother?

364
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,447
Colin.

365
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:31,886
Sometimes he makes calls from the shop.
Mostly when I'm not around.

366
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,151
Could you talk to him?

367
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,535
That's Maurice and his gang.
Look, Ahkbar.

368
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,499
- I think it's- -
- My name is Han.

369
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:51,206
Well, Han, look.

370
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:55,970
They find you, you'll have serious
problems. Go out the window.

371
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,545
No. I like this way.

372
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:01,442
It's your funeral.

373
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:05,086
Dim sum good. You call again.
Dim sum all time. Thanks.

374
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,058
What you doing bothering
Miss O'Day?

375
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,818
He's the delivery boy, moron.

376
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,759
I done told you,
my name is Maurice, all right?

377
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,426
I'm sorry.
I keep forgetting, boo.

378
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,169
Hey, dog.

379
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,072
- You smell something?
- No, I don't smell nothing.

380
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,573
- Where's the take- out?
- You hungry, baby?

381
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,578
Cover the front.

382
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,480
Hey, Dim Sum!

383
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,185
You's a real funny man!

384
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,217
Mr. O'Day don't let things
slide lightly.

385
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:43,850
He also don't like the wrong element
around his daughter.

386
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:46,187
It's up to me not to let it happen.

387
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:49,724
Kick his ass.

388
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,597
You ain't the only one
that knows some shit.

389
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,984
Get up! Get him!

390
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,821
He's headed around the front!

391
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:13,807
Who that motherfucker?

392
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:20,890
Great country.

393
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,585
Free cars.

394
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:46,247
Sun Tzu was lost to us by
assassination less than a month ago.

395
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:50,519
A grocery store was firebombed,
and his wife killed.

396
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:57,351
With all respect, Ch'u, any of us could
be killed at any time...

397
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,687
...overlord or not.

398
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:02,757
We are not the blacks, Victor.

399
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,029
Our loyalty to each other
is unquestioned.

400
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:11,435
At least let us strike harder.
Show our true strength.

401
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:17,346
We will only do that
when it serves us best.

402
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,342
Let Kai worry about this.

403
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:51,189
Han, I don't want to lose another son.

404
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,672
The old man didn't think you'd make it.

405
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:07,876
And you?

406
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,810
I knew you would.

407
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:14,246
It's been a long time, Han.
It's good to see you.

408
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:15,678
Tell me...

409
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:17,919
...what happened that night?

410
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,919
He got in a fight in a black club.

411
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:25,151
Threats had been made. They got Po the
same evening, before I could find him.

412
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:27,326
Why there?

413
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,788
He wouldn't tell me.

414
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,261
Your brother was a loose cannon,
but he didn't deserve this.

415
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,008
Why fight with blacks?

416
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:43,510
Well, the waterfront's only
four square miles.

417
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,210
Half the businesses belong to us...

418
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,277
...the other half to them.

419
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,150
It was just a matter of time.

420
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,043
I was afraid prison would
make you soft.

421
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:26,453
People don't get soft in prison.

422
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,000
Pretty good.

423
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,245
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

424
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:52,642
You must be hungry.

425
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,852
Could you find something
better to do than creep up on me?

426
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:58,984
And besides,
aren't you in the wrong part of town?

427
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,019
At your store,
they said you were here.

428
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,953
Hold on a minute.
Come on, kids.

429
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,692
All right, all right.
Who wants what?

430
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,367
I wanted the yellow one.

431
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:12,966
Give it to him.
He's the baby.

432
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,362
Stop! You want one?

433
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,597
Sure. I want the yellow one.

434
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,867
Well, you get a green one.

435
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:31,544
Did you talk to your brother?

436
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:33,789
What made you think that?

437
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,422
Hey, time- out.

438
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,692
See that guy?
He works for my dad...

439
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,364
...and he's got a bad attitude.

440
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:49,404
Who's your friend?

441
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:51,469
We met in line.
I didn't catch your name.

442
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:54,700
- What's your name?
- My friends call me Ahkbar.

443
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:56,137
Well, Ahkbar...

444
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:57,812
...this is Mac. Mac, Ahkbar.

445
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:03,214
As-Salaam-Alaikum, Ahkbar.

446
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,447
Yo, ain't that the guy?

447
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:06,620
Hell, yeah.

448
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,752
Same chump took Mo's ride
after he beat us down.

449
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:13,827
Ain't nobody ever kicked my ass.
What are you talking about?

450
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:15,224
That the dude.

451
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:19,157
We can't get started, because we're
a man short. Would you help us out?

452
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:20,027
Me?

453
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:22,530
No. I don't know this game.

454
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,831
Man, it's easier than breathing.

455
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,805
Besides, Trish loves football players.

456
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:32,642
Right on.

457
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,689
Fellas, got myself a fresh recruit.

458
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,292
He's a rookie...

459
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,891
...so take it easy on him.

460
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:55,067
Give me that!

461
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,330
The brothers and l
always give rookies warm welcomes.

462
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:00,509
So don't worry about a thing.

463
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,735
I just need you to stand behind me.

464
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:06,915
I'll give you the ball, and you run
to the far end of the field.

465
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,645
That's all?

466
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:10,379
That's all.

467
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,651
Set!

468
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,454
Let's see your special on this one.

469
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:19,793
Mo's special!

470
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,556
We're coming, boys.

471
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,665
- Run!
- Run?

472
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:38,614
Come on!

473
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:48,253
Damn.

474
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,424
Like I told your ass the other day.

475
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,686
You ain't the only one
that knows some shit.

476
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,098
Good job, my man.

477
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,773
- Are they allowed to do that?
- Sure.

478
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:06,532
It's a contact sport.

479
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:09,540
This time, run a little bit
and turn up the middle.

480
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:11,770
And I'll throw the ball to you.

481
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,213
It's called the "buttonhook."

482
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:15,781
- On two.
- Buttonhook.

483
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,018
Right there.

484
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:18,717
Set!

485
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:40,566
Damn! Shakalack- shakalack.
Mo, you my Negro, Mo.

486
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:42,675
Break his ass.

487
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,480
How come nobody else gets hit?

488
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,683
Because you're the one with the ball.

489
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,418
Okay. I'd like hut three.

490
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:56,344
You all right?

491
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:05,360
Hey, brother!

492
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,162
American football!

493
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,335
- That was great!
- Brother!

494
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:18,441
- You were great.
- Damn, that was hot.

495
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,902
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

496
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:22,706
Here's my address.

497
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,375
Please let me know
when you talk to your brother.

498
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,705
Here.

499
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,418
- Did you see that?
- Awesome!

500
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:32,746
- I know.
- That was great!

501
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:39,887
Pop ain't feeling me.

502
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:45,030
He still wants me to ride around
with training wheels and shit.

503
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:48,831
I was like,
Pops got to understand that...

504
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:52,200
...me and him is cut from,
like, the same cloth.

505
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:56,108
He needs to start respecting me
as a man.

506
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:59,782
I mean, he needs to start respecting
my manhood.

507
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:01,743
Shit, I went to college.

508
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,777
That's right, baby. You did.

509
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,919
That's right, baby. I did.

510
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,858
Like that phone call I got
the other day.

511
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:14,424
Pop's too afraid about me handling
the business and stuff.

512
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:18,327
But, baby, I got ideas.
I mean, you know I got ideas.

513
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:22,736
Shit, I am an idea.

514
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,975
I'm about to have
an Einstein moment.

515
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:30,543
Magic about to happen.
It's gonna be scary.

516
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:33,511
Hey, look, all I want to know is...

517
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:37,583
...when does Colin O'Day
get to run with the show?

518
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:40,756
Don't worry, baby.
Your turn's coming.

519
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,471
Sorry, Mr. O'Day.
These things are never easy.

520
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:38,178
Wait. Wait.

521
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:40,279
Don't look at this. Come on.

522
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,109
Look at me. Please!

523
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:44,885
No!

524
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:04,997
You had something to do with this.

525
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:07,075
What do you want me to say?

526
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,708
- Go to hell.
- What do you want?

527
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:14,406
You're as responsible as the people
who did this to my brother.

528
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,480
Don't come near me.
I hate you.

529
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,953
You might as well have thrown him
out that window yourself.

530
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,703
That was my boy, Mac.

531
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:41,868
I know.

532
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,417
They killed my boy.

533
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:57,390
We're at the crossroads now, lsaak.

534
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:03,929
I won't pretend I know
what you're feeling.

535
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:08,493
But I know you got to keep it
stitched up until business is done.

536
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,574
The people who did this...

537
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:15,242
...I promise you on my life...

538
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:18,579
...they'll be knocked out of the box
in due time.

539
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:20,213
I'll make sure of it.

540
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:44,783
What happened?

541
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:53,428
Once, Colin and I did something
we thought would really be funny.

542
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:57,190
He hid out front...

543
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:59,526
...while I ran to tell my mom
he'd been hurt.

544
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:02,704
Hit by a car or something
really bad like that.

545
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:07,874
When she came,
he was supposed to jump out.

546
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:09,969
You know, surprise her...

547
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:13,545
...and we'd all fall out
and have this great laugh.

548
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:16,376
Me and my mom always loved
a good laugh.

549
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:22,390
I was about 8 or 9.

550
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:25,256
Colin was, like, 1 1 .

551
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:30,626
I don't remember
how we came up with it...

552
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:34,968
...but, sure enough, I start screaming
and yelling...

553
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:40,671
...and my mom runs out of the house.
She's, like, "Trish, what's wrong?"

554
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:42,774
When I told her, I mean...

555
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,273
...the look on her face.

556
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:50,152
Even when Colin popped up to show it
was a joke, she couldn't stop crying.

557
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:52,114
She just held him close.

558
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:54,952
Clutched him, you know?

559
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:03,191
I was just a baby. I didn't get it
then, but I get it now.

560
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:05,130
Tell me.

561
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,704
- What happened?
- Colin's dead.

562
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:12,831
And no matter how hard I cry...

563
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:17,501
...he's not gonna pop up
and show me it was just a joke.

564
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:22,045
I'm sorry.

565
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,216
I need your help.

566
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:31,587
I gotta put this thing together
just as much as you do now.

567
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:37,960
Gentlemen, we are ready to approach
the NFL.

568
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:42,334
I don't think any of the other bids
are even in contention.

569
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:45,904
Our package is staggering.
We've got the money.

570
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:50,976
We've got the organization, waterfront
real estate seconds from the bridge.

571
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:54,512
God Himself couldn't have designed
a better spot for a stadium.

572
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:57,242
That's right. You know me well.

573
01:05:57,553 --> 01:06:01,421
lf I say there's caviar on the
mountain, you bring the crackers.

574
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:03,824
I don't get it.

575
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:06,022
These are waterfront properties.

576
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:08,496
They must mean something.

577
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:10,692
Po didn't want them found.

578
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:15,200
Yeah, but why?

579
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:20,939
ls this the place?

580
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,804
Yeah. It says 44 Driggs Road.

581
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:30,509
ls anybody here?

582
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,102
Get down!

583
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:25,919
You're Chinese.

584
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:29,587
No shit!

585
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,259
I can't hit a girl.

586
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:48,099
ln America, if a girI's kicking your
ass, you don't have to be a gentleman.

587
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,337
Damn. Look at that!

588
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:02,903
They a trip.

589
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:07,539
Them little things pay the rent,
you know what I mean?

590
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:08,874
Yeah, no doubt.

591
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:13,850
Crabs in a barrel can't climb out,
and they don't want to stay in.

592
01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:16,114
I guess they strange like that.

593
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,892
Some brothers strange like that too.

594
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:21,562
As soon as one of us move up...

595
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:25,096
...a crab motherfucker like yourself
pulls us right back down.

596
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:27,499
Let me tell you something.

597
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,834
This place seems like a piece of shit
to a guy like you...

598
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:34,975
...but that's still my piece of shit.
And I ain't selling it.

599
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:38,846
I got work to do.

600
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,077
Let's look at it another way.

601
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:49,919
You got two choices.
You either sign us over the deed...

602
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:53,026
...or I blow your head off
and leave it with these crabs.

603
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:55,129
Now, which is it?

604
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:59,162
- Yo, yo! Okay!
- I can't hear you!

605
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:00,629
All right! I'll do it!

606
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:03,360
- What?
- I said I'll do it, man!

607
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,800
Go in and get me that deed.

608
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:16,476
Don't look at me.
I'll put your ass on the news tonight.

609
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:19,846
What's the matter with you, man?
You crazy?

610
01:14:22,524 --> 01:14:24,116
I can live with that.

611
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,194
How are you? Good to see you.

612
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:06,401
Good to see you.

613
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:08,431
They don't care
there's a war going on.

614
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:11,104
They don't care if the damn barge
is on fire.

615
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,497
This is a treat.

616
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:15,607
What brings you downtown?

617
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:17,003
You heard about Victor Ho?

618
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:21,412
We're looking forward to
some blowback.

619
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:25,016
That's why we're here. We got a tip
this place is gonna get hit.

620
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:26,986
You gotta be kidding me.

621
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:29,220
- When?
- Right now.

622
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:35,153
Get the money.

623
01:16:49,237 --> 01:16:51,205
Thank you for attending this meeting...

624
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,874
...on such a short notice.

625
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:56,610
My dear brothers, when you expire...

626
01:16:56,845 --> 01:17:00,110
...your territory will remain
within the collective.

627
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:02,775
Of course, since I alone survive...

628
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:07,317
...the collective is,
in actuality, only me.

629
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:24,027
You don't wanna be in my path
when my feet are put to the coals.

630
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:25,864
Misery loves company.

631
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:28,838
Oh, young Mr. Roth,
you sound nervous.

632
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:32,444
May I suggest acupuncture?

633
01:17:33,682 --> 01:17:35,650
I hope you have some good news for me.

634
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:39,285
There's no need for threats
or theatrics.

635
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:43,615
None of us want to drag this out any
longer than it already has.

636
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:47,384
Then close out your business
and get me those deeds.

637
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:49,722
Damn. Susie!

638
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:53,362
Could you get me Keyshawn Johnson,
please?

639
01:17:55,937 --> 01:17:59,429
It's Papa, baby. It's me.
Don't be scared.

640
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:03,344
Listen, I need you to come with me.

641
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:05,437
Why?

642
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:10,177
I'll tell you.
Just come on out front, okay?

643
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,736
I can't have you hanging with
Ch'u's boy.

644
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:33,807
- His name is Han, Daddy.
- Okay, then.

645
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,532
I need you to stay away from Han.

646
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:37,642
Afraid I'll catch one of your
bullets?

647
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:39,642
It is too dangerous right now.

648
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:40,882
I'll take my chances.

649
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:50,416
Did you do it?

650
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:52,050
Did I do what?

651
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:53,886
Did you have his brother murdered?

652
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:55,494
Where did that come from?

653
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:56,889
I need to know.

654
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:59,498
No, I didn't.
I'm telling you, no.

655
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:01,858
I did not.

656
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:03,604
Trisha, look at me.

657
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:07,068
I had nothing to do with it.

658
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:13,807
But one of them's going to pay
for what happened to Colin.

659
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:15,481
ls that what a businessman is?

660
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:18,149
That's what I call
protecting my family.

661
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:24,158
You can't touch me!

662
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:26,087
lnterception, baby!

663
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:28,218
- Come on, man.
- Running it back!

664
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:30,226
Look at that!
Go back to slow mo!

665
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:31,557
I'm coming for you.

666
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:33,323
I ain't gonna even look.

667
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:35,866
I'm just gonna play.
I can't see!

668
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:50,979
He could go...

669
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:53,346
...all the way!

670
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:56,949
How your mama doing?

671
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:58,191
How your mama doing?!

672
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:01,219
Touchdown, baby!

673
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:03,620
Take it, take it!

674
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:07,593
These nuts in your mouth.

675
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:09,962
I said put the nuts in your mou- -

676
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:13,068
Why y'all not working?! Get to work!

677
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:15,709
Shiftless Negroes.

678
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:17,940
Toby! Go on!

679
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:21,547
Where is Mac, Maurice?

680
01:20:21,883 --> 01:20:23,111
He's out back.

681
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:24,477
I wanna talk to him.

682
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:25,818
Yes, sir.

683
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,027
You sure you don't want nothing?

684
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:42,233
No, I'm okay.

685
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:43,834
I'll be downstairs.

686
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:45,198
All right.

687
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:19,804
I remember sitting in that chair...

688
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:23,101
...watching you fix your hair
for your first date.

689
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:26,008
You hooked me up with Dexter Benson.

690
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:29,650
My man Dex.

691
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:33,519
- I really liked that boy.
- Please, Daddy.

692
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:36,757
He was so scared, he bit my lip
when he kissed me good night.

693
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:38,184
Wait a second.

694
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,454
You didn't kiss that boy
on your first date.

695
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,357
That's right, I did.

696
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:45,933
I guess I was trying
to get back at you.

697
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:50,067
You know, I hate to admit it....

698
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:52,399
I miss those times.

699
01:22:00,348 --> 01:22:02,908
I can tell you
when I missed your ma the most.

700
01:22:03,818 --> 01:22:06,787
At your graduations and your dates.

701
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:10,619
I know I ain't never been able
to talk to you.

702
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:13,820
There's a lot of things
I wanted to say.

703
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:17,126
It don't ever come out right.
I know that.

704
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:28,435
I want you in my life.

705
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:30,637
There are...

706
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:32,507
...certain things....

707
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:34,544
Until I can prove these things...

708
01:22:34,816 --> 01:22:36,374
...I want you to stay here with me.

709
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:38,210
Listen to me.

710
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,853
There are people out there who'll
try to hurt me by hurting you.

711
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,580
Like they did your brother.

712
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:46,759
I'll be damned
if I let them do that.

713
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:48,961
Who is it?

714
01:22:49,197 --> 01:22:50,289
You got a phone call.

715
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:51,658
Not now, Mac.

716
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,128
It's Roth.

717
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:56,466
Today's a good day.

718
01:22:56,838 --> 01:22:58,430
It's deed day.

719
01:22:58,907 --> 01:23:01,603
- I trust everything's in order.
-Absolutely.

720
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:03,777
Tonight all my dreams come true.

721
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:05,946
I'll see you at the club as planned.

722
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,305
I'll have your check.

723
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:12,179
Where do we stand with Silk?

724
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:14,821
We're hooking up at 8:00.

725
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:16,415
Watch out for him.

726
01:23:17,559 --> 01:23:18,958
The boy's tricky.

727
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:21,321
Don't let him get the upper hand.

728
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:24,455
I can handle Silk.

729
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:36,807
Are you out of your mind?

730
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:42,142
What are you doing here?

731
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:44,283
I missed you.

732
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:48,921
You miss me. I'll miss you when
my father finds out you're here.

733
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:51,725
He's standing right outside the door.

734
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:53,550
What'll I do with you?

735
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:55,288
Jesus!

736
01:23:57,532 --> 01:23:58,999
Hey, Dad.

737
01:23:59,234 --> 01:24:01,168
I gotta go take care of business.

738
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:04,097
You need anything,
you just say the word.

739
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:05,601
I am fine, Dad.

740
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:08,870
I'm chilling.
You do what you gotta do, okay?

741
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:15,443
Jesus! Come on, you gotta go!

742
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,211
No, what do you...?

743
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:25,291
- You all right?
- I'm fine, Daddy.

744
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:28,090
Listen, baby, you hungry?

745
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:31,025
They getting pizza.
Say the word, they'll bring it up.

746
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:34,565
I'm not hungry.
lf I get hungry, I'll let them know.

747
01:24:35,603 --> 01:24:37,230
I'll be back after a while.

748
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:46,243
Damn, this pizza good.

749
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:51,449
Baby girl, open up! I got some
sausage and pepperoni pizza!

750
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:54,244
Open up the door.
Ain't no swine on it.

751
01:24:57,358 --> 01:25:00,816
Pizza make you wanna slap your mama.
What's this, Domino's?!

752
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,802
Damn, never been up in here before.

753
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:15,842
They got Prince up on the wall.

754
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:19,012
You a freak too, ain't you, Trish?
Where you at?

755
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:21,048
I'm coming around the corner.

756
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:27,946
Damn!

757
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:31,715
So where are we going?

758
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:34,155
Look.

759
01:25:34,529 --> 01:25:38,295
All the places on this list
have been moved out or burned out.

760
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:39,727
Except this one.

761
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:42,959
I know this one.

762
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:46,966
My father and Mac talked about that.
It's Silk's casino.

763
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:48,600
Casino?

764
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:49,707
Let's gamble.

765
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:51,437
All right.

766
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:24,403
Now you're giving me some
B- boy flavor.

767
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:26,239
Hip- hop.

768
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:34,613
I know hip-hop.

769
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:48,334
Hey, what's up?

770
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:55,037
Come on, he's with me. Okay?
Can you give me a break?

771
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:57,034
You lsaak's girl, huh?

772
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:58,402
That's right, cutie.

773
01:26:59,647 --> 01:27:00,739
Will you let me in?

774
01:27:03,251 --> 01:27:04,047
All right.

775
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:06,685
Thank you. Come on.

776
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:22,427
I'm not feeling this.
Let's go to the dance floor.

777
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:26,704
- It's not my scene.
- Not your scene? Cute. Let's go.

778
01:28:25,066 --> 01:28:26,033
Look here!

779
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:28,836
Man, can you believe this?

780
01:28:35,343 --> 01:28:36,935
What the hell is she doing?

781
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:52,190
What's up, Trish?

782
01:28:52,927 --> 01:28:54,155
What's up, Silk?

783
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:55,553
Let's talk.

784
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:56,855
All right.

785
01:28:57,765 --> 01:28:58,732
Come on.

786
01:29:02,403 --> 01:29:04,667
Your pop's running around
like Donald Trump...

787
01:29:04,906 --> 01:29:08,398
...grabbing up every piece of
waterfront he can get his hands on.

788
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:10,637
Now he wants to be a club owner.

789
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:12,810
He's working on something big.

790
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:15,582
Something big?
I don't care how big it is.

791
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:19,013
Your pops can sweat me,
and Mac can sweat me all they want.

792
01:29:19,287 --> 01:29:21,118
But Silk is staying right here.

793
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:23,515
My sentiments exactly, Silkie.

794
01:29:23,958 --> 01:29:27,724
I think we all should stay right here
for one more negotiation.

795
01:29:27,962 --> 01:29:32,023
It's like that, partner? You're gonna
try to roll up in here on me?

796
01:29:32,266 --> 01:29:34,359
- What the hell are you doing?
- Shut up.

797
01:29:34,602 --> 01:29:36,593
Does my daddy know about this?

798
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:37,735
Sit down.

799
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:40,005
What?

800
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:41,299
What?

801
01:29:42,176 --> 01:29:43,268
What?!

802
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:45,310
You might as well lose the gat.

803
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:48,310
It's like I told your punk ass before...

804
01:29:48,983 --> 01:29:50,575
...I ain't signing shit.

805
01:29:50,818 --> 01:29:52,410
All right, I'll sign it myself.

806
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:05,099
Well, well, well.

807
01:30:06,033 --> 01:30:08,092
lf it ain't my man Dim Sum.

808
01:30:09,804 --> 01:30:10,930
Busy night?

809
01:30:11,572 --> 01:30:15,804
Ran off with the boss's daughter,
threw a wrench in Mac's program.

810
01:30:16,844 --> 01:30:17,776
And now...

811
01:30:18,012 --> 01:30:20,344
...you about to get your ass kicked.

812
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:22,614
Where is she?

813
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:25,284
You didn't think you'd get
them panties, did you?

814
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:26,952
What?

815
01:30:27,188 --> 01:30:31,989
Trish. You didn't really think
she was gonna give it up to you.

816
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:33,927
Here's the deal, meatball.

817
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:39,532
You let me go, I let you live.

818
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:44,665
He say he gonna let me live!

819
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:51,068
I'm really gonna miss you.

820
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:54,143
The way you make me laugh.
But look on the bright side.

821
01:30:54,682 --> 01:30:56,479
Some you win...

822
01:30:57,318 --> 01:30:59,445
...and, Dim Sum, you lose.

823
01:31:14,235 --> 01:31:17,830
The hell what Mac say!
Somebody kill that son of a bitch!

824
01:31:32,854 --> 01:31:33,786
Get up!

825
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:36,148
Get your bitch- asses up!
Come on!

826
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:42,729
Dim Sum...!

827
01:31:49,804 --> 01:31:52,329
Come out and play!

828
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:03,744
Hey, rice noodle!

829
01:33:57,064 --> 01:33:58,463
What the hell you doing?!

830
01:33:58,933 --> 01:34:00,958
I hope you land on your feet,
grasshopper.

831
01:34:02,503 --> 01:34:05,165
You're not the only one knows some shit.

832
01:34:05,406 --> 01:34:08,000
- Where is she?
- The Oakridge Men's Club.

833
01:34:12,346 --> 01:34:14,041
Sorry, moron.

834
01:34:30,197 --> 01:34:31,721
Name's Maurice...

835
01:34:33,434 --> 01:34:34,230
...bitch.

836
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:40,765
Cristal, Ch'u.

837
01:34:41,976 --> 01:34:43,705
You only live once.

838
01:34:45,813 --> 01:34:48,509
Everything's kosher,
down to the last pagoda.

839
01:34:48,949 --> 01:34:50,109
You're a good man.

840
01:35:08,769 --> 01:35:10,202
Spend it well.

841
01:35:20,147 --> 01:35:21,273
Mr. O'Day.

842
01:35:21,649 --> 01:35:22,946
Mr. Ch'u.

843
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:25,878
You once gave me your condolences.

844
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:29,317
I now offer mine
in regards to your son.

845
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:33,549
There'll be ample time for you
to express your regrets, Mr. Ch'u.

846
01:35:52,313 --> 01:35:53,746
Amazing.

847
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:57,247
How much?

848
01:36:01,622 --> 01:36:04,284
So this has been
what it's all about, huh?

849
01:36:05,459 --> 01:36:07,927
I wish my boy could see me do this.

850
01:36:08,329 --> 01:36:10,092
And could be here.

851
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:12,460
Go ahead and keep that.

852
01:36:17,805 --> 01:36:19,102
I don't understand.

853
01:36:19,907 --> 01:36:21,465
You just acquired another partner.

854
01:36:22,576 --> 01:36:25,773
I think it's time the NFL
had a black owner. Don't you?

855
01:36:27,982 --> 01:36:29,779
You're joking, right?

856
01:36:38,826 --> 01:36:40,293
You're not joking.

857
01:36:40,661 --> 01:36:43,425
I'm afraid I already have a partner.
Several, in fact.

858
01:36:43,697 --> 01:36:45,631
Well, you just got another one...

859
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:47,664
...in fact.

860
01:36:47,935 --> 01:36:51,701
Don't forget, Mr. Roth,
without these deeds...

861
01:36:51,939 --> 01:36:53,236
...you have no....

862
01:36:54,241 --> 01:36:56,539
What is that popular term, Dave?

863
01:36:56,777 --> 01:36:57,801
Cheddar?

864
01:37:00,581 --> 01:37:03,209
- Do you mind if I have a moment?
- No, go ahead.

865
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:11,724
So this is the plan?

866
01:37:13,727 --> 01:37:15,217
You wanna be partners with Roth.

867
01:37:17,898 --> 01:37:20,332
I've been waiting for the right time
to tell you.

868
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:25,904
I'm going to the owner's box.

869
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:28,401
We are going to the owner's box.

870
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:31,602
I ain't playing with these people.

871
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:34,877
The owner's box.

872
01:37:40,754 --> 01:37:42,779
I've had enough of this legit shit.

873
01:37:44,925 --> 01:37:45,857
What's that?

874
01:37:46,093 --> 01:37:50,291
I believe they call it
corporate restructuring. Right?

875
01:37:52,566 --> 01:37:55,558
lsaak O'Day Development's getting
straight jacked...

876
01:37:55,803 --> 01:37:57,168
...by Machiavellian lnc.

877
01:37:58,205 --> 01:38:00,173
I almost forgot.

878
01:38:00,741 --> 01:38:03,335
I'm taking your most valued asset.

879
01:38:07,748 --> 01:38:08,806
You blaze, we blaze.

880
01:38:10,251 --> 01:38:11,479
Are you crazy?

881
01:38:14,622 --> 01:38:17,113
ls she worth $38 million to you?

882
01:38:17,758 --> 01:38:19,555
Now I know you're crazy.

883
01:38:20,694 --> 01:38:25,290
You lost your mind thinking whites would
let you own a piece of their game.

884
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:28,495
Me and Ch'u had an understanding.

885
01:38:28,769 --> 01:38:32,432
Anybody who didn't sign those deeds,
we took care of.

886
01:38:33,374 --> 01:38:34,432
What do you mean?

887
01:38:34,775 --> 01:38:37,437
Daddy, I was there
when he killed Silk.

888
01:38:38,112 --> 01:38:42,014
So now after everything,
you really gonna try to do this?

889
01:38:42,316 --> 01:38:45,774
I have been covering your ass
for years, lsaak.

890
01:38:46,353 --> 01:38:49,322
Quite frankly,
I am just tired of being your boy.

891
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:52,481
You think because you put your kids
through college...

892
01:38:52,726 --> 01:38:56,218
...that it's supposed to make all
your crooked straight?

893
01:38:56,830 --> 01:38:59,799
Man, you want to own a damn box.

894
01:39:00,501 --> 01:39:02,992
Mac just want to own the streets.

895
01:39:03,704 --> 01:39:05,934
That's always been your problem.

896
01:39:07,841 --> 01:39:08,899
What about Colin?

897
01:39:09,176 --> 01:39:10,609
What about him?

898
01:39:13,147 --> 01:39:14,079
You killed Colin?

899
01:39:16,917 --> 01:39:20,182
Even fake wars have casualties, lsaak.

900
01:39:21,088 --> 01:39:22,885
I guess old Collard Green couldn't fly.

901
01:40:21,782 --> 01:40:23,340
Damn it, Roth!

902
01:40:23,717 --> 01:40:24,649
Watch her.

903
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:14,034
Go get it!

904
01:41:29,716 --> 01:41:30,648
Take it down!

905
01:41:34,221 --> 01:41:35,745
Take it down now!

906
01:41:36,056 --> 01:41:37,148
No way!

907
01:41:37,391 --> 01:41:38,756
Take it down!

908
01:41:51,772 --> 01:41:53,831
Why did you kill my brother?

909
01:41:56,877 --> 01:41:59,505
All that Chinese shit
happened in- house.

910
01:42:00,647 --> 01:42:02,842
You have your own people
to thank for that.

911
01:42:06,487 --> 01:42:07,886
Not that you'll get the chance.

912
01:42:09,523 --> 01:42:12,356
Sorry, Romeo, but you gotta die.

913
01:42:17,998 --> 01:42:19,158
Damn...

914
01:42:20,067 --> 01:42:21,694
...that's some cold shit.

915
01:42:30,844 --> 01:42:32,311
We've called the police.

916
01:42:32,579 --> 01:42:35,207
- There's an ambulance on its way.
- Thank you.

917
01:42:35,449 --> 01:42:37,349
I'm all right, baby.
How you feeling?

918
01:42:37,584 --> 01:42:40,212
You doing all right?
I'm doing all right.

919
01:42:42,456 --> 01:42:43,821
ls that Han?

920
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:45,258
Yes.

921
01:42:45,859 --> 01:42:48,828
You're the one who's been
making all this trouble, huh?

922
01:42:50,764 --> 01:42:52,493
Let me shake your hand.

923
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:58,635
You got a firm grip. I like that.

924
01:43:00,407 --> 01:43:01,931
Stay with your father.

925
01:43:02,276 --> 01:43:03,607
I will.

926
01:43:08,282 --> 01:43:10,045
He a lot shorter than I thought.

927
01:43:10,317 --> 01:43:12,046
- I know.
- He just a little guy.

928
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:14,116
I don't know what to do with you.

929
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:43,815
Your brother wasn't suited to lead.

930
01:43:47,087 --> 01:43:48,850
He didn't have the discipline.

931
01:43:50,123 --> 01:43:51,317
That's why you killed him.

932
01:43:51,558 --> 01:43:53,355
That's why I had to.

933
01:43:54,027 --> 01:43:55,119
"Had to"?

934
01:43:57,531 --> 01:43:58,555
My brother.

935
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:01,458
That's right.

936
01:44:02,603 --> 01:44:03,797
That...

937
01:44:04,438 --> 01:44:05,735
...was a mistake.

938
01:44:06,173 --> 01:44:07,140
Come on.

939
01:45:34,795 --> 01:45:35,762
Come on!

940
01:45:41,802 --> 01:45:43,235
Give me some skin! Come on!

941
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:07,361
Are you okay?

942
01:50:08,301 --> 01:50:09,734
I'm okay.

943
01:50:22,549 --> 01:50:23,914
Come on, let's go.

944
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:40,000
