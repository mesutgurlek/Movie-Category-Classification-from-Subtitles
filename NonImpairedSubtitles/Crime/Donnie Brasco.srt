1
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,500
You're not making sense. You're not
saying things that mean anything.

2
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,800
It's not even a debate.
It's a better automobile!

3
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,300
It's not even a debate.
It's a better automobile!

4
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,200
A Lincoln is not better
than a Cadillac.

5
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,200
A Lincoln is better.
It's a better automobile.

6
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,200
Forget about it.
Cadillac got more acceleration.

7
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,800
It's got more power.

8
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,300
It's got better handling.

9
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,700
It's got more leg room.

10
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,600
- It's got more power.
- You just said that.

11
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,000
- Bingo.
- You just said, " More power."

12
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,700
- You're repeating yourself.
- I said that?

13
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,600
- You're getting senile.
- He's got me fucking aggravated.

14
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Mercedes got it all over
both of them.

15
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,100
A Lincoln's like driving
a fucking water bed.

16
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,600
- A Mercedes.
- It's a good car.

17
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,200
- Who's that over there?
- Who?

18
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,600
The guy by the bar
with the mustache.

19
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,300
That's Don the Jeweler.

20
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,800
- Jilly brought him around.
-Jilly Four-Eyes?

21
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,200
Not Jilly Four-Eyes.
Jilly from Queens.

22
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,500
- You think he's a wise guy?
- No, he's a connected guy.

23
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,300
Connected?
If I had a thing to lay off...

24
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,100
- he could lay it off?
- You got something?

25
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,100
- That ain't the question.
- You got something to lay off?

26
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,300
I'm just saying if I had a thing,
he could lay it off.

27
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,400
All that money
you owe downtown...

28
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,800
you'd have to lay off
a Brinks truck.

29
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,500
- Sonny's in love.
- I think Lefty's in love.

30
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,600
I'll see you.

31
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,500
Were you asleep?

32
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,900
- Are you okay, honey?
- I'm okay.

33
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,800
Go back to sleep.
I'll call you tomorrow.

34
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,500
That's good, babe.

35
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,600
I'm sorry. I gotta go back
to sleep. I'm so tired.

36
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,600
- All right.
- All right.

37
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,900
What?

38
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,800
Put the phone on your pillow.

39
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,300
I wanna listen to you breathe.

40
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,600
You Don the Jeweler?

41
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,100
There.
That's some beautiful thing.

42
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,200
- Why don't you give it to your wife?
- How am I gonna give it to my wife?

43
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,900
- I ain't married.
- Got a girlfriend?

44
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,600
- I got a girlfriend.
- So marry her.

45
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,800
You for real?

46
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm asking you to middle
a diamond for me here.

47
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,500
All I want from my end is 8,000$

48
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,500
And I'm saying to you...

49
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,900
give it to somebody that don't know
better because that's a fugazy.

50
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,700
All right?

51
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,800
That's a fugazy?
How do you know?

52
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,600
- You looked at it for two seconds.
- These are fake.

53
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,700
I know what a fugazy is.

54
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,700
Hey, pal...

55
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,300
you want to see something?

56
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,900
I'll show you something.

57
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,800
There you go. Nice stone.
That's a beautiful thing.

58
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,800
But it's not my thing.
What about this?

59
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Try and sell it. Be a dunsky.
Give it a shot.

60
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,300
You're calling me a dunsky?

61
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,700
You know who I am?

62
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,900
Left, have a spritzer.

63
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,600
You want to embarrass yourself
with this thing?

64
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,500
Embarrass myself?
My family, my children...

65
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,300
my mother can hold her head up
in any neighborhood in this city.

66
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,300
In all the five boroughs,
I'm known. Forget about it.

67
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,400
I'm known all over
the fucking world.

68
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Anybody ask anybody
about Lefty...

69
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,800
from Mulberry Street.

70
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,500
- You're pissing up the wrong tree.
- I didn't mean no disrespect.

71
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,300
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Where you going?

72
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,900
Sit down there.

73
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,100
You're gonna walk out on me?

74
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,500
You don't walk out on me.
I walk out on you.

75
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,300
- You got a car?
- I got a car.

76
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,600
Let's get your car.
Come on.

77
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,900
- Put the window up. I'll catch a draft.
- I'm getting cancer over here.

78
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,300
- You'll be all right.
- Where we going?

79
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,300
You a cop?
Don't ask so many questions.

80
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,300
I earn the money I'm earning,
I can't tell a fucking zircon?

81
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,800
- There's good money in it?
- What?

82
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,600
- Jewels?
- Thank you.

83
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,000
If you know what you're doing,
there is.

84
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,900
Let's go to 23rd and 8th to find out
if you know what you're doing.

85
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,800
You owe me eight grand.

86
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,000
Hold on. Wait.
I gave you the diamond.

87
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,500
Who's this guy?

88
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,500
- He says it's a fugazy.
- What's a fugazy?

89
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,600
- Your diamond's a fugazy.
- What is a fugazy?

90
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,400
- You know.
- Don't you tell me what I know.

91
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,300
- You know what you did.
- One of you has to be wrong.

92
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,100
That's a Tiffany diamond.

93
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,600
Left, that is my wife's
fucking diamond ring.

94
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,600
- It's a fugazy.
- What is your problem?

95
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,900
- Come on.
- Eight thousand dollars.

96
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,700
Let me talk to this guy
for a second.

97
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,700
Go have a drink.
Let me talk to the guy.

98
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,500
Come on.

99
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,500
I got a black belt.
If you fuck--

100
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
This guy will kill you.
You understand?

101
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,800
We have two minutes
to figure a way out of this.

102
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,000
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry? Shut the fuck up.

103
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,500
- Sorry won't do it.
- I don't want to die.

104
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,400
- Yeah? What kind of car do you drive?
- A Porsche.

105
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Give me the keys.

106
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,200
All right.

107
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,700
- Whose car is it now?
- It's Lefty's.

108
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,400
Lefty's stuff.
All right. Good.

109
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,600
That's for the drinks, pal.

110
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,200
Why'd you pay for that drink, Don?
A wise guy never pays for a drink.

111
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,500
- I didn't know that.
- Always on the arm.

112
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,400
All right.

113
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,500
You scared that guy though.

114
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,400
That cracks me up.

115
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,700
I got 26 hits under my belt,
and he's scared of you. Fuck.

116
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,900
- Pull over. I've gotta do something.
- Right here?

117
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,700
All right.

118
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,600
Give me a hand with this.
Pull this out.

119
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,000
- You're taking the whole thing apart.
- There ain't nothing under the dash.

120
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,500
I didn't hear a thing.

121
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,500
There it is.

122
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,900
- I can go up the back.
- What are you doing down there?

123
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,300
-Just feeling around here.
- You think I got a wire in my car?

124
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,500
- Fuck!
- You think I'm fucking stupid?

125
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,100
- Did I say you got a wire?
- Say it to my face!

126
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,900
I think you owe me an apology.

127
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,300
Ain't the question.
I lost a screwdriver here.

128
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,700
- You lost what?
- The screwdriver fell down there.

129
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,500
You lost a screwdriver
in my fucking stereo?

130
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,800
You'll find it again.
It's down there.

131
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,000
- So you like the DeVille?
- Forget about it.

132
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,900
- I got the Fleetwood Brougham.
- Is that right? With the velour?

133
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,900
Forget about it.

134
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,100
Are you married?

135
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,100
- I got a girl in California.
- That's good.

136
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,100
She should stay in California.

137
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,300
Keep your eye off your balls.

138
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,600
- You're right.
- I'm always right.

139
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,700
A wise guy's always right.
Even when he's wrong, he's right.

140
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,700
All the way up the line:
connected guy to wise guy...

141
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,700
to skipper to boss.

142
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,500
- I know that.
- You know? What do you know?

143
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
It's kind of like the army,
a chain of command.

144
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,900
The army?
It ain't nothing like the army.

145
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,400
The army is some guy
you don't know...

146
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,400
sending you out to kill
some other guy you don't know.

147
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,300
- You wanna check in with me tomorrow?
- All right.

148
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,400
I don't know how the fuck you knew
that ring was a fugazy.

149
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,600
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- So long.

150
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,400
Don the Jeweler is a good earner.
He ain't a leech.

151
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,600
He keeps to himself.
He's a jewel guy.

152
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,300
- Where's he from,Jilly?
- Florida.

153
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,200
But where in Florida?
The beach?

154
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,200
No, not the beach.

155
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,800
I don't know.

156
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,400
Wherever the fuck the Dodgers
have spring training.

157
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,200
- He's a stand-up guy?
- I knew him. I didn't fuck him.

158
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,800
Come here!

159
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
What do you say, Jilly?
How are you?

160
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,000
My friend Lefty's asking about you.
Don't embarrass me.

161
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,500
I wouldn't do that to you.
You know that.

162
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,700
If you do, one of us
is gonna whack you out.

163
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,300
- That's not good.
- All right.

164
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,400
Go back to your bath.

165
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,900
- Take care, kid.
- Good to see you.

166
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,700
When I introduce you...

167
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,400
I'm gonna say,
"This is a friend of mine."

168
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,000
That means you're a connected guy.

169
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,100
If I said instead,
"This is a friend of ours,"

170
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,700
that would mean
you're a made guy.

171
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,300
" Friend of mine."
" Friend of ours."

172
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,500
- What do I call you?
- Keep your mouth shut about me.

173
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,000
Don't say--

174
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
You got a couple of fazools?

175
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,800
I got some things
I gotta take care of.

176
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,800
What do you want?
A hundred?

177
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,700
What are you doing?

178
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,900
Wise guy don't carry his money
in a wallet.

179
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,300
Wise guy carries money
in a roll. Like this.

180
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,300
Beaner on the outside.
Like that. Come on.

181
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,200
That mustache--

182
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,800
You gotta get rid of that mustache.
That's against the rules.

183
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,900
And get a pair of pants.

184
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,200
This ain't a fucking rodeo.
Dress like I dress.

185
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,400
This is my family.

186
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,900
- More, even, than my own family.
- Is that right?

187
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,100
- I don't got a family.
- You don't?

188
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,900
I'm an orphan.
I grew up in an orphanage.

189
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,800
Ain't the question.
Even if you had a family.

190
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,100
If this is your family,
then this is your family.

191
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,100
You know what I'm saying?

192
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,900
I'm freezing my balls off.

193
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,400
Why do we stand outside
all day in the cold?

194
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,200
- Gotta show the flag.
- The flag of Antarctica.

195
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,000
- What's going on?
- Lefty, what do you say?

196
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,200
- This is Donnie, a friend of mine.
- How you doing?

197
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,400
The good news is my dick
is now a popsicle.

198
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,600
- Hi, Sonny.
- Sonny, how you doing?

199
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,100
Sonny Red.

200
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,000
- Who's this guy?
- This is Donnie, a friend of mine.

201
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,500
Just stand there
and look dangerous, friend.

202
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,800
He does look dangerous,
don't he?

203
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,000
You gonna make this week's vig?
I hope so.

204
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,300
I don't wanna come looking for you.
You hear me?

205
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,100
Come on, Bruno.

206
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,100
I just shit in my pants.

207
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
It's the boss, Donnie.

208
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,500
Joseph, the Bureau
wants your autograph.

209
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,900
- What's that you want me to sign?
- Forget about it.

210
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,000
- Forget about it is right.
- Listen.

211
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,400
They want you to shave
the mustache. Regulations.

212
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,700
How do they even know about it?
Did you rat me out?

213
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,300
I didn't rat you out.

214
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,000
- Show-and-tell.
- Nice.

215
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,100
- What?
- He wants me to shave.

216
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,900
Who? Ruggiero?

217
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,400
Regulations. Here.

218
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,400
You know something?

219
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,700
I got him.
I got my hooks in the guy.

220
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,700
Cloaked by the high grasses
of the African savanna...

221
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,500
the stalking cheetah
moves stealthily towards his prey.

222
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,500
- How you doing?
- You're here for my dad?

223
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,200
- I'm Donnie.
- Tommy. How are you?

224
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,900
- Good.
- Merry Christmas. Come on in.

225
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,900
Benny's watching TV.
You met Tommy?

226
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,500
We met. Thank you.

227
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,600
Separated from the herd,
the gazelle senses danger.

228
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,200
- Donnie's here.
- Too late.

229
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,300
The cheetah springs.

230
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,100
Benny loves animals.

231
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,700
- You see that?
- I'll be in the kitchen.

232
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,100
- Hunter and hunted.
- Look at that.

233
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,500
Predator and prey.
The endless cycle of nature repeated.

234
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,000
I brought this by for you.
It's a little Christmas present.

235
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,000
Wait a minute. Here.

236
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,800
I'm sorry, Left,
but I'm in a little bit of a rush here.

237
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,500
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

238
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,500
That's really nice of you.

239
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,500
Wow. Look at this.

240
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,200
Very generous of you, Donnie.
Thank you. Good boy.

241
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,000
- Happy holidays.
- Where you going?

242
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,400
I thought you were an orphan.

243
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,200
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't want to spoil your day.

244
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,100
Come on.

245
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,800
No man of mine is gonna be alone
on Christmas. Come on in here.

246
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,600
You think I cook
like them goombahs in Brooklyn?

247
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,300
All they know is manicotti.
A hundred years, they'll be manicotti.

248
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,700
You never ate coq au vin?

249
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,000
Here we are.

250
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Can of collagen,
can of tomatoes.

251
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,100
- Punch of salt.
- "Punch"?

252
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,500
- Punch or pinch?
- Punch.

253
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,000
Not pinch.

254
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,100
- Did I say, "pinch" ?
- You said, "punch."

255
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,500
Sometimes you don't make
no fucking sense.

256
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,700
- You got all this?
- I can't cook special like Benny.

257
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,600
Shut up, Annette.
Forget about it.

258
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,400
Wherever you go,
the best cooks are men.

259
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,800
On Mars, the best cooks
are gonna be men. That's a fact.

260
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,300
Wait till you taste
this coq au vin.

261
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,100
It's gonna melt in your mouth
like Holy Communion.

262
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,600
What the fuck is that?

263
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,600
Annette, get that.

264
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,200
- Thank you.
- Sure.

265
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,100
- Thanks, Annette.
- Sure.

266
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,400
She's a good woman.

267
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,500
One broad,
that's enough for anyone.

268
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,200
Pop, I'm going out
for a couple hours.

269
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,800
Merry Christmas.
Donnie, take care.

270
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,500
You too.
Take it easy.

271
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,700
My own fucking son's a junkie.
Can you believe it?

272
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,600
What can you do?

273
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,900
- Give him a smack once in a while.
- I got bruises on my hands.

274
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,300
You don't know my worries.
I can't do right by Annette.

275
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,900
I ain't got three bucks.

276
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,200
I put a bet on a horse, that horse
don't do what it's supposed to do...

277
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,700
Iike everything else in my life.

278
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,200
I got cancer of the prick.

279
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,400
My ex-wife lives in this building.
Can you believe it? I run into her.

280
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,600
I need three spritzers
afterward to calm down.

281
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,200
What are you talking about,
"cancer of the prick"?

282
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,800
It's cancer of the prick.

283
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,900
You didn't know that?
I'm in the medical books for that.

284
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,400
I got this boat too,
this Bertram.

285
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Fifty-footer with twin Chryslers.
I had to get rid of it.

286
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,100
The money I owe Sonny Red.
The vig alone is $3,000.

287
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,500
- Who's that guy with him?
- Bruno, that's his son.

288
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,000
- I'd like to put a dent in his head.
- You don't do that.

289
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,700
- You don't touch him.
- I know. I wish I could.

290
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,800
You wish?

291
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,000
A guy like you
doesn't touch a made guy.

292
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,400
You know what I did yesterday?

293
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,000
I went in front
of all the skippers...

294
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,900
that cocksucker Sonny Red,
all of them.

295
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,700
I went on the record with you.
You know what that means?

296
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,400
- I think I do.
- You ain't got no fucking idea.

297
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,600
Nobody can touch you now.
I'm your man.

298
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,400
Jesus Christ couldn't touch you,
because I represent you.

299
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,000
So keep your nose clean...

300
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,300
be a good earner,
follow the rules...

301
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,600
and, who knows, maybe one day
when they open the books...

302
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,800
you get straightened out.

303
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,300
Become a wise guy, a made guy.

304
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,900
Come on.
Lift your glass.

305
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,900
I'd die with you, Donnie.
Anything happens, I'm responsible.

306
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,800
- All right?
- All right.

307
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,600
All right.

308
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,900
- Thanks a lot. That was excellent.
- Could you spot me a couple, please?

309
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'll get it back to you.
You got it here.

310
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,900
Here you go.

311
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,700
I'll get back to you on this.
Call me tomorrow.

312
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,600
All right.

313
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,500
- Look what the reindeer dragged in.
- Merry Christmas.

314
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,900
I was working.
Nothing I could do.

315
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,600
Working.

316
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,400
- Who works Christmas Day, Joe?
- I do.

317
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,700
Where's the kids?

318
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,300
They couldn't wait anymore.

319
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,100
That's nice.

320
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,600
Christmas, they can't wait up
for their father.

321
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,400
- Is that your way of apologizing?
- You know I'm sorry.

322
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,000
I don't need to know.
The girls need to know.

323
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,100
Be sure to introduce your self.
They might think you're a salesman.

324
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:50,000
- If you knew what I was doing today-
- I don't know...

325
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
because you don't tell me.

326
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,600
It's for your own protection.

327
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,600
As if any of this is for me.

328
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,900
You're getting the checks, right?

329
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,500
- I'm getting the checks.
- Good. Don't say it like it's nothing.

330
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,800
- It's not a husband.
- A lot of women would disagree.

331
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:18,200
Is that what you do
with all your time?

332
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,200
- Conduct polls with all your women?
- I won't dignify that.

333
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,700
Seven days a week,
I'm out there busting my ass...

334
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,900
- and this is the shit I come home to.
- You said it would be three months.

335
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,400
- It's going on two years.
- How do you find anything?

336
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,000
- You got cereal on three shelves.
- Shit.

337
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,100
You got cereal over here.
Put stuff away.

338
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,700
- It's my job. Quit my job?
- What about my job?

339
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,600
Christmas Day you don't show up
so Mommy puts on the Santa suit.

340
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,700
Mommy hangs the lights.
Mommy carves the roast.

341
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,400
Just leave it alone.

342
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,000
It would be easier
if you tell me what goes on.

343
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,500
- What do you do?
- Please leave me alone.

344
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,700
Terry and Kerry are at my mother's.
Why don't you pick them up?

345
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,100
Where's Sherry?

346
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,600
- Sherry is with her boyfriend.
- What?

347
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,700
She's at her boyfriend's.

348
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,700
- Since when does she have a boyfriend?
- She's 12, Joe.

349
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,700
- I didn't okay this, Maggie.
- You can't drop from the sky...

350
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,000
- like God and bark orders!
- I am the husband and father!

351
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
- I put food on that table!
- Undercover husband!

352
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,000
What do I get for Christmas?
Empty fucking house!

353
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,600
I'm here.

354
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,800
I wanted to be alone with you.

355
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,600
Oh, God.

356
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,000
What happened to your mustache?

357
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,100
- The Bureau made me shave it off.
- They did?

358
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,000
It was the only thing
I liked about this job.

359
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,600
- Sherry's got a boyfriend?
- She does.

360
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,800
Nice kid.
He's so nice.

361
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,600
He's on the wrestling team.

362
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,200
I'll bet
he's on the wrestling team.

363
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,500
Kerry's doing the catechism.
So sweet.

364
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,700
And they're swimming.

365
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,700
Coach says he's never seen
nothing like it.

366
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,200
There's a meet Saturday.

367
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,900
What am I gonna do?
We'll see.

368
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,700
You know I wouldn't do this to you
if I didn't think you could handle it.

369
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,900
I'm not worried about me.

370
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,700
Come here.

371
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,400
All right,
what's going on, kids?

372
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,100
Am I getting the silent treatment?

373
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,600
I'll make a bet with you.

374
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,100
I'll bet you $20...

375
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,300
that you can't get through
this meal without saying three words.

376
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,300
- All right?
- You lose.

377
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,600
What did she say?

378
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,300
You didn't see the paper?
How come you didn't see the paper?

379
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,300
Every morning you're reading the paper.
What were you reading this morning?

380
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,600
Look at this. Oh, fuck.

381
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,900
Can you believe this?
The boss gets whacked.

382
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,100
The fucking boss.

383
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,000
You never hear from the boss
until he gets whacked...

384
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,100
- then your life gets turned around.
- Tell me where we're going.

385
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,300
- I got sent for.
- What does that mean?

386
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
What do you think it means?

387
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,900
You don't want to go,
I'll turn around.

388
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,200
Are you gonna take a left
off the bridge?

389
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,700
- Not here, after the bridge.
- I gotta go. You get sent for, you go.

390
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,700
Sonny sent for me.

391
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,900
I'm sick with this--

392
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,500
- You got sent for by Sonny Red?
- Did I say Sonny Red?

393
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,400
Not Sonny Red.
Sonny Black.

394
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,800
What are you doing?
Put the fuck-

395
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,800
You wanna kill me
with that draft?

396
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,800
Sonny Black is your friend.
What's the big deal?

397
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,300
Right. What friend?

398
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,400
Ain't the question, friend.

399
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,700
The whole time Sonny Black's
in the can...

400
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,500
he's got a family,
he's got a mistress.

401
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,000
He's got a mistress
for the mistress.

402
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,700
I watched out for all of them.

403
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,200
I was the only one.
Nobody else gave a fuck.

404
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,500
200 fazools,
week in, week out.

405
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,700
Why are you worried then?

406
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,200
Sometimes I think, in that orphanage,
they dropped you on your head.

407
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,900
- Explain it to me.
- I know how a hit gets set up.

408
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,700
You think I don't know that?

409
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,900
How many times I been on the other end
of that phone? Twenty-six times.

410
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You just got done saying
you and Sonny Black are friends-

411
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,500
Donnie, I got sent for.

412
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,400
In our thing, you get sent for,
you go in alive, you come out dead...

413
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
and it's your best friend
that does it.

414
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,600
Anything should happen to me...

415
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,400
make sure Annette gets the car.

416
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,000
Love on the rocks
Ain't no surprise

417
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,800
- Spritzer, Left?
- Later, maybe.

418
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,300
Look at this hand.
This ain't a hand.

419
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,600
This is a fucking deformed
Creature from the Black Lagoon's claw...

420
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,100
I got here.

421
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,500
- You throwing that down?
- I don't know.

422
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,100
Gin.

423
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,800
- Paulie, that ain't gin.
- Ain't no fucking surprise neither.

424
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,200
- It's gin.
- You got two sevens.

425
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,500
I had three sevens.

426
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,200
Nicky, I know I had three sevens.
Don't start this shit now.

427
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,900
You know you had three sevens?
You don't have three sevens.

428
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,800
I had three sevens.

429
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,600
From now on, I'll deal out the cards,
you say "gin" whenever you feel like it.

430
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,900
That fucking boots. Two hundred
in action, and we got five?

431
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,000
- We're taking a beating this week.
- Let's go for a ride.

432
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,900
I got a new car.

433
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,300
- Can you believe the ride on this car?
- That was something about the boss.

434
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,500
- We all gotta go sometime.
- I got a date in Jersey tonight.

435
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,900
- Which broad is this?
- The one from the calendar.

436
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,600
Miss Pennzoil Air Filter of 1978.

437
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,700
- Why's he looking in the mirror?
- What are you doing, Left?

438
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:42,300
What's it look like I'm doing?
I'm checking my lipstick.

439
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,600
What are we doing here, Sonny?
We glomming something or what?

440
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,300
- You, wait in the car.
- What?

441
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,100
Watch the car.

442
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,900
Fuck! Shit!

443
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,400
I think I shit in my pants.
What is this?

444
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,700
He's supposed to go
to a animal trainer somewhere.

445
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,700
- Fuck him.
- Left, I think he likes you.

446
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,100
- Either that or he's just hungry.
- What's he got to do with me?

447
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,900
- Sonny, what is this?
- It's for you.

448
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,900
- For me?
- I know how you feel about animals.

449
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,000
It's a gift from me.

450
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,900
It's for me.

451
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,700
I got the power.
Now you're under me.

452
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,200
- What do you mean?
- Sonny got upped.

453
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,600
You got upped?

454
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,800
Rusty's running everything
from the can.

455
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Sonny Red's got Little ltaly.

456
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,700
- I got Brooklyn.
- That's why you sent for me?

457
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,000
Did you think
you were gonna get whacked?

458
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,300
Lefty thought
he was gonna get whacked.

459
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,600
Congratulations. Come here.

460
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,100
Good stuff.

461
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:41,500
Sonny Black they make skipper.
I ain't a mutt.

462
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,100
Thirty years busting my hump.
For what? A lion.

463
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,000
I'm like the invisible man
in this thing.

464
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,200
Five hours ago, you thought
you were gonna get whacked.

465
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,600
- Did I say I was gonna get whacked?
- Not in so many words.

466
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
I don't understand you.
How many words does it take?

467
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,600
You're right.
I misunderstood.

468
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,600
Thirty years I'm earning.

469
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Any work to be done,
call Lefty.

470
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,500
I never complained.

471
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,500
Twenty-six guys I clipped.

472
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,600
Do I get upped?
No, they pass me by.

473
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:23,000
Sonny Black gets upped.
I don't get fucking upped.

474
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,400
Sonny was probably in on
whacking the boss.

475
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,700
Of course he was.

476
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,300
Whacking the boss.

477
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,500
Another think I get left out of.

478
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,100
But let me tell you what.

479
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,800
Look at that.

480
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,900
I wish I had that boat again,
that Bertram.

481
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,400
I'd get in my car with a net,
I'd drive down to the pier...

482
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,600
I'd get on that boat,
and I'd go.

483
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,100
East, west, north, south,
nobody ever find me.

484
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,200
Look at this thing.
It's a fucking insult.

485
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,700
Happiness

486
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,300
You're full of sweet surprise
and happiness

487
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
You fill my hot desire

488
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,100
More

489
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,400
And over

490
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
And over again

491
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,200
Keep that goodness coming

492
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,900
Let's go! Come on!

493
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,100
Let's go!

494
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,200
Come on!

495
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I gave it to him!

496
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
- Come on, Sonny!
- Jesus, no, Sonny! Please!

497
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,500
All right.

498
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,000
Fuck.

499
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,800
Sonny, come here.

500
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,600
Good seeing you.

501
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:42,100
Bobby, give Sonny a good table
and a bottle of your best on me.

502
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,100
Get him a tailor too.

503
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,900
- What do you say, Kurt?
- How's it going?

504
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,100
This is Dean Blanford
from Washington.

505
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,600
Call me Donnie.
I don't want to get confused.

506
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,700
I know what you mean, pal.
Sometimes you get so busy--

507
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,900
- Even I forget my own name.
- Is that so? Is it hard to cash checks?

508
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,100
You said that part already.
What's next?

509
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,500
Now that the operation
is beginning to bear fruit...

510
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,100
headquarters transferred me up here
to Sin City.

511
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,000
What for?
You wanna keep an eye on me?

512
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,800
To make sure you receive
the proper support.

513
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,500
And to make sure, in all the hubbub,
there are no missed opportunities.

514
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,900
"Missed opportunities"?
Like what?

515
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,000
We have an agent in Miami
goes by the name of Richie Gazzo.

516
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,700
His operation
is potentially very sweet.

517
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,000
Problem is it's languishing right now
and needs jump-starting.

518
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,000
The Bureau would like you
to go down there...

519
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,500
and see if you could interest
your mob friends.

520
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,600
- If you vouch for Richie Gazzo--
- I won't vouch for nobody I don't know.

521
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,400
I was hoping we'd get off
on the right foot.

522
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:38,100
What's the big deal? You just vouch
for the guy. Sit in the sun for a week.

523
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,700
- I vouch for him, I could wind up dead.
- So could he.

524
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,600
You're not the only one
risking your life.

525
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,100
Oh, boy.
Well, I'll let you know.

526
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,700
I'll get back to you.

527
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,600
He'll let us know?

528
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,000
- Good evening. How many?
- Five.

529
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:09,300
My wife says Japanese is very in.
She read about it in Parade. Very big.

530
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,200
Have seat. Take off shoes.
Please.

531
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,700
- What kind of food is this?
- It's fish.

532
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,600
- Please, take off shoes.
- Are you kidding?

533
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,600
Take off your pants.
What the fuck is that?

534
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,700
- It's Japanese tradition.
- Is that right?

535
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,700
- I ain't doing it.
- I'm afraid it's necessary.

536
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,200
I ain't taking
my fucking shoes off.

537
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,300
- What?
- When in Rome--

538
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,800
Who won the fucking war?

539
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,700
What war?

540
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,700
We did.
Do you want to fight it again?

541
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,200
- Take off your shoes.
- I ain't gonna do it.

542
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,300
- Take your shoes off.
- I ain't taking my shoes off.

543
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,500
I want to eat sometime tonight.

544
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,700
Take off your shoes
or I'll chop off your feet.

545
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,600
Do you want me to take orders
from a fucking Jap?

546
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,200
I grew up in an orphanage because
my old man was killed in Okinawa.

547
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,800
You think I'm taking my shoes off
for this prick?

548
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,300
I ain't doing it.

549
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,600
Listen, my friend's not gonna
take his shoes off, Mr. Moto.

550
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:31,100
Neither are the rest of us.
So give us a table before I smack you.

551
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,500
You must take off your shoes.

552
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,400
- You fuck.
- Get him down!

553
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,700
- You like shoes?
- Let me get in there.

554
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,800
Slant-eyed motherfucker!

555
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,900
- Come on. Let's go.
- Son of a bitch!

556
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,600
- Watch him!
- Stupid fuck!

557
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,900
Kick the shit out of him, Donnie!
Kick him!

558
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,800
Get those fucking gooks!

559
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,900
Don't you move, you fuck.

560
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:25,800
Cigars. Up the block they sell for $50
a box. We could sell them for 25.

561
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:30,000
You give a few of those to a broad,
she'll do anything you want.

562
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Should give three quaaludes to Brenda.
Maybe she'd cook.

563
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,700
I doubt it.

564
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,200
I got a guy that's got
this load of Sergio Valentis.

565
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,500
A dime on the vig.

566
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,700
- What do you got on the street?
- Hundred grand.

567
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:46,100
That should be 250
by the end of the year.

568
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,300
I can get these real cheap,
and I got a guy who can move them.

569
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:55,100
- Will you fucking stop that?
- How else am I supposed to open this?

570
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,500
Open sesame!

571
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,700
- A score's a score.
- I got 100 pairs.

572
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,700
Sonny Red's got a million dollars
a month with his trucks in Jersey.

573
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,200
What do I get?
Steak knives and parking meters.

574
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,500
We ought to hijack an oil tanker.
There's a lot of money in oil.

575
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:19,100
I know a guy in Florida.
He says it's wide-open down there.

576
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,700
- Where in Florida?
- Florida. The beach.

577
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,100
The whole economy's moving down there.
They call it the Sun Belt.

578
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,200
The economy has to be good
for us to make any money.

579
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,900
You don't think they got
their own wise guys in Florida?

580
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,800
Florida and Arizona
because of the energy crisis.

581
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,800
I heard a whole conversation
on the Long John Neville Show.

582
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,800
Here you got 3,000 wise guys
all chasing the same nickel.

583
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,000
You're from Florida, Donnie?

584
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,000
Lot of parking meters
down in Florida.

585
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:06,000
You guys think this is funny?
I'm the skipper now.

586
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,300
I gotta answer!

587
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,500
Fifty grand a month
I kick up to Rusty. Every month!

588
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,300
One day, I'm gonna die.

589
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:20,200
I'm gonna be here in the same room
with all these same fucking guys...

590
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:25,200
talking about
the same fucking scams...

591
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,500
that never amount to nothing!

592
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,200
That's how I'll know
I've been sent to fucking hell.

593
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,100
Joe, give these humps another drink.
It's all they're good for.

594
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:52,800
I tell you right now, we better start
earning or somebody's gonna get clipped.

595
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,500
Why did you inject that
with Florida?

596
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,400
- I didn't inject nothing.
- You injected that.

597
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,300
I know you. You don't say nothing
unless there's a reason.

598
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,100
- I was making conversation.
- Mr. Smart Conversation...

599
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,500
you tell me what happens
if Sonny Black decides to go to Florida?

600
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,600
Who said he's going to Florida?

601
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,900
Donnie, don't think you could
pull the wool over my eyes.

602
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,400
I see you siding up
to Sonny Black.

603
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,800
With my eyes, I'm looking at you.
You're doing it. Come on.

604
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,200
I ain't siding up
to Sonny Black.

605
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:36,400
He goes to Florida,
you're responsible...

606
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,100
and I'm responsible
because I represent you.

607
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,200
Left, come on.
I was just bullshitting around.

608
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,200
You think you can trust Sonny Black.
You can't trust Sonny Black.

609
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,300
Sonny Black
is one big, fat, fucking...

610
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,700
- snake in the--
- Snake in the grass.

611
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,400
You can't say that now.
Sonny Black is a skipper.

612
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,200
You don't open your mouth
about him.

613
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:59,700
Lefty, this fucking guy, Richie,
calls me up, he says...

614
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,900
"I'm getting hassled by a couple
of half-assed wise guys."

615
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,100
He's looking for a partner
to give him a little peace of mind.

616
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,500
- He's got this nightclub there.
- A nightclub?

617
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,900
Got a singles bar
near the beach.

618
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,500
I got two grenades in my house.

619
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,900
I'd blow up all Mulberry Street
before I'd give you up.

620
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,400
I don't know what I would do
if you did something wrong.

621
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,200
Come on!

622
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,500
Come on, Four!

623
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,600
- Shit.
- That was in!

624
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,000
Bullshit.

625
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,200
Don't push me!

626
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,800
- Shit! He lives!
- What the fuck are you--

627
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,400
Jesus Christ.

628
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,500
Half hour.

629
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,600
- Where is this guy?
- I don't know.

630
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,500
- Is that him?
- Yeah, that's him.

631
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,800
Don, you brought the calvary.

632
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:17,400
- Richie Gazzo.
- How you doing?

633
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,100
Oops! I'm late!

634
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,500
You guys got a chance to work
on your suntans out here.

635
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,500
King's Court,
where every man is a king.

636
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,700
Wait until you get a load
of the banquet room. You'll plotz.

637
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,200
Ask him why this place
is such a dump.

638
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,700
He wants to know
why it's such a dump, Richie.

639
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,400
I had to shut the doors.

640
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,600
These bums had their hands
in my pockets.

641
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,200
200 bucks for this,
300 bucks for that--

642
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,400
I got a wife that does that.

643
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,700
Ask him to leave, Donnie.

644
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,500
- Step outside, take a look at the car.
- Sure. Great.

645
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,200
What kind of a man has a malvole?
He won't provide for his own wife.

646
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,800
- I'm telling you this guy's all right.
- You vouch for him?

647
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,400
When I knew him before,
he was all right.

648
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,900
I'm making an introduction. You have
to make the decision about the joint.

649
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,400
This would be something, you know?

650
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,300
We had my own lounge down here,
me and you.

651
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,300
- You know?
- What about Sonny?

652
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,600
Imagine Sonny Black operating down here.
The way he is?

653
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,400
Come on.
Sonny Black belongs in Brooklyn.

654
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,400
I guess
if everything worked out...

655
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,600
we could send
a few fazools up there.

656
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,200
Thirty years
I'm busting my hump.

657
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,500
What do I got?

658
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,900
Even a dog gets a warm piece
of the sidewalk.

659
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:17,700
I ought to show something
for what I did.

660
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,100
Definitely.

661
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,200
This ain't New York down here.

662
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:26,900
New York with the politics,
all the old beefs and the grudges.

663
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,200
Down here, a guy like me
could sit down with the boss.

664
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,900
You know what I'm saying?

665
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,600
Get out from under,
be a free agent again.

666
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,400
I'm telling you,
nothing but right.

667
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,300
Lefty wants to ask Santo Trafficante
for permission to operate down here.

668
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,600
- You have to give me a boat.
- We can't afford that.

669
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,600
- What kind of a boat?
- I don't know. Like a 70-footer.

670
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,000
- I want to take him out for the day.
- You're talking $6,000 a day.

671
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,900
Santo Trafficante
is the boss of Florida.

672
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,600
-Did you know he sits on the Commission?
-I knew that.

673
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,400
- Good.
- It's up to an 80-foot boat.

674
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,000
We just picked up Lefty on a wiretap
talking to one of Trafficante's guys.

675
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:51,200
A few things to go over
to make a loan-sharking indictment.

676
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,300
This is important!

677
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,600
Ninety-footer, actually.

678
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,600
I came here
and vouched for this guy.

679
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,600
I'm gonna take Trafficante out
in a rubber ducky?

680
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,100
- We'll have to wash your mouth out.
- Does Sally Paintglass...

681
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:08,100
- report to Nicky or Nicky Cigars?
- Nicky Glasses.

682
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,500
As I was saying, we've got
to fold Sonny into the RICO--

683
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,300
I need a boat
for this fucking sit-down!

684
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,800
I'm a Mormon, mister.
Now clean it up!

685
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I think you got a malfunction
on your tape recorder.

686
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,100
I'm not getting anything here.

687
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,700
I'm worried.
He's getting strung out.

688
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:56,300
We can get what we want.
Fuck him.

689
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,500
There it is.

690
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,000
Just moving behind,
nice and slow.

691
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,000
Count it, my friend.
Go ahead.

692
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,500
It's all there.
No bullshit.

693
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,700
We're bueno?

694
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,900
Pleasure doing business
with you, caballeros.

695
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,900
O, Columbia
the gem of the ocean

696
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,600
The home of the brave
and the free.

697
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,600
- Fuck.
- Fuck!

698
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,700
Mommy, I need some help.

699
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,900
- It's too tight.
- Here, sweetie.

700
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,100
- I'm in Florida.
- Why are you in Florida?

701
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,700
I don't know.
I'm hunting for turtles.

702
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,500
What do you think I'm doing
in Florida? I'm working.

703
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:13,800
It's 12 degrees here.
Excuse me, you're wearing this coat!

704
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,400
Young lady,
you are wearing this coat.

705
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,400
- Bitch.
- What did you call me?

706
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,100
Is everything all right?

707
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,900
Would it matter if I said no?

708
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,100
- I guess not.
- So don't ask me. Come on, stand up.

709
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,200
"John Wayne dead. Nation mourns."

710
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,700
How can John Wayne die?

711
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,200
Fucking Indians got him.

712
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:46,800
Old-fashioned family man.
Ruled with an iron hand. Look at that.

713
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,400
Let me talk to Kerry
about her Communion.

714
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,900
Oh my God, Joe.
She doesn't want to do it.

715
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,200
What do you mean?
She ain't got no choice.

716
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,700
- You are wearing this coat!
- Put her on the phone.

717
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,900
I don't know when I can call again.
Does she know not to bite the wafer?

718
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I don't know.
She's acting out or something.

719
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,700
- I'll be back next week.
- Thank you.

720
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,000
I promise I'll get back
for her Communion.

721
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,700
- Yours doesn't look any better.
- Don't start in with your sister.

722
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,000
- I have to go.
- What?

723
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,000
I love you. Shit.

724
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,800
Who was that on the phone, Richie?

725
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,800
What did Sonny say?

726
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:30,800
- You told Sonny about the club?
- I thought you did.

727
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,600
- Just shut up about it. Call Richie.
- All right.

728
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:53,000
Big guy like Santo Trafficante,
he's been around...

729
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,300
since the Moustache Petes.

730
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,300
You have to respect the man.

731
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,300
- You get that boat yet?
- I'm working on it.

732
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:04,200
Don't tell me no.
You have to get that boat.

733
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,100
I reached out already. His man says,
"Lefty, he loves boats."

734
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,800
I told him 100-foot boat.
I'm on the clothes line now.

735
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,300
I'm working on it.

736
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,900
- Don't disappoint me again, please.
- Since when did I disappoint you?

737
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,900
Forget about it. What's this?

738
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,900
Look at that.
Same thing we call each other.

739
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:25,800
Friend of mine, friend of ours.
Good.

740
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,700
But there's the double meaning.
You get it?

741
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:33,300
Know what I mean?
A boss appreciates a thing like that.

742
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,600
- Like the irony of it.
- Yeah, irony.

743
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,700
Forget about it.
You put a beaner inside here...

744
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,800
then he knows
these are men of men.

745
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,800
You see, if I work out
the strategy right...

746
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,200
you gotta hold up
your end now.

747
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,800
- You know?
- I know.

748
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,800
How much is this?
Donnie, you got some thing on you?

749
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,900
- What are you doing there?
- How about five dollars?

750
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:03,400
- You're doing an amazing job.
- What?

751
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,400
- I mean, we all think so.
- Absolutely.

752
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,600
For crying out loud.
Fuck.

753
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,800
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

754
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,800
What's "Forget about it"?
What is that?

755
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,700
"Forget about it" is like...

756
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,700
if you agree with someone.

757
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:31,700
Like, "Raquel Welch is one great piece
of ass." "Forget about it."

758
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,600
But then, if you disagree, like,
"A Lincoln is better than a Cadillac"?

759
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,900
But then if something is the greatest
thing in the world, like...

760
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,400
"Those peppers! Forget about it!"
You know?

761
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,200
It's also like saying,
"Go to hell."

762
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,600
Like,
"Paulie, you got a one-inch pecker."

763
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,400
And Paulie says,
"Forget about it."

764
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:03,800
Sometimes it just means
forget about it.

765
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,600
All right. Thank you very much.
I got it.

766
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,600
Let me tell you something.
I don't get this boat for Lefty--

767
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,700
- Forget about it?
- Fucking forget about it.

768
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,400
You know that sting operation?
What do you call it--

769
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,300
Where the agents dress up like Arabs
and try to bribe congressmen?

770
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,800
- They got a boat down here.
- What?

771
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,200
That's right.
It's Abscam.
