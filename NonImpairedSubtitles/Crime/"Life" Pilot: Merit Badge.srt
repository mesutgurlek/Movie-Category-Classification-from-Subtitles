1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,220
All you have as a cop
is other cops.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,390
But we walk the way.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,240
********

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,430
After the trial, I had to get
counseling just so I could sleep.

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,280
There was all that proof.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,470
We all turned our back on charlie crews.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,190
In his first years, 

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,070
Office Robert Stark Former Partner of Charlie Crews
he was in that prison hospital more--
more than he was out.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,120
Cop doing time, please.

10
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:29,950
Broke nearly every bone in his body.

11
00:00:31,142 --> 00:00:32,927
I heard they cut him real bad too.

12
00:00:32,937 --> 00:00:34,561
Over 100 stitches.

13
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:36,330
Dr.Alan Fay Pelican Bay Surgeon
About 241 stitches.

14
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:40,952
I mean, the jury was
only out for an hour.

15
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:42,301
There was all that proof.

16
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:45,202
After the case was
reopened, we found that

17
00:00:45,216 --> 00:00:49,042
none of the physical evidence
on scene matched officer crews.

18
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:51,560
I wasn't the only one.

19
00:00:51,577 --> 00:00:53,513
We all thought he was guilty.

20
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:55,262
did charlie tell you he didn't do it?

21
00:00:55,276 --> 00:00:56,841
Jennifer Conover Ex-Wife of Charlie Crews
yes.

22
00:00:56,855 --> 00:01:00,221
Jennifer Conover Ex-Wife of Charlie Crews
and how did you feel when you found out
he was being exonerated?

23
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:01,681
that he was innocent?

24
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:09,190
I don't wanna do this anymore.

25
00:01:13,587 --> 00:01:17,931
Constance Griffiths Attorney for Charlie Crews
As I said at the press conference after
detective crews was exonerated, 

26
00:01:17,946 --> 00:01:22,211
Constance Griffiths Attorney for Charlie Crews
life was his sentence, 
and life is what he got back.

27
00:01:22,418 --> 00:01:27,312
Pelican Bay Penitentiary 1995~2007

28
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:34,581
crews!

29
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:36,410
Los Angeles Four Months Later
detective crews!

30
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:39,372
Los Angeles Four Months Later
detective crews!

31
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:41,540
you are detective crews, aren't you?

32
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:44,143
Yeah.

33
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:45,871
I guess I am.

34
00:01:45,885 --> 00:01:47,353
Okay, well, would you like to be sure?

35
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:49,723
Because we're about to
walk into a crime scene.

36
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:51,921
I'm sure.

37
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:54,883
Great.

38
00:01:58,667 --> 00:01:59,912
Are you reese?

39
00:02:00,315 --> 00:02:01,583
Detective reese.

40
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,421
10-4.

41
00:02:17,378 --> 00:02:19,050
Crews, it's a kid in there.

42
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:20,733
It's your first day back.

43
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:23,511
If you don't think you can
handle it, I can do it myself.

44
00:02:51,248 --> 00:02:53,912
Small caliber, close range.

45
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:55,391
probably not a lot of noise.

46
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:57,030
No one reported hearing anything.

47
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:59,013
The bullet was a through and through.

48
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:02,150
Is that the kid's dog?

49
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:03,572
Yeah, he won't move.

50
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:05,742
did you find the slug?

51
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:06,820
no, ma'am.

52
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:09,223
did you look for it?

53
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:11,112
Yes, detective. we looked for it.

54
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:14,450
Did you ask the dog?

55
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:15,211
did we ask the dog?

56
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:16,532
we did not ask the dog, no.

57
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:18,840
no, sir. we did not ask the dog.

58
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:29,961
Hey.

59
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:33,931
Hey.Hey.

60
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:41,722
Good boy.

61
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:49,370
There's a bullet here beneath the skin.

62
00:03:49,385 --> 00:03:53,111
Dog must have caught the bullet
in the gut after it exited the kid.

63
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:55,083
all right, get the dog to a vet.

64
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:57,452
get the bullet out and to ballistics.

65
00:03:57,775 --> 00:03:59,650
What are you doing way over here?

66
00:03:59,668 --> 00:04:01,471
get me animal reg to my location.

67
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:03,462
did you bring something over?

68
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:06,852
Your master's over there.

69
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:11,832
Did you bring something over?

70
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:13,263
detective crews.

71
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:16,443
detective!

72
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:20,211
hey, hold on.

73
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:23,382
- that looks like a--
is that a finger? - Yeah.

74
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:36,913
Dog must have took a bullet for the kid, 

75
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:39,190
then took the shooter's finger off.

76
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:42,271
Anyone ever love you that much?

79
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:51,870
If I got out after all that
time, I got all that money, 

80
00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:54,141
Office Krebbs and Zerco LAPD Current
I sure as would not be going back to work.

81
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:57,000
Now I handle his settlement money.

82
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:58,522
Ted Earley Financial Advisor to Charlie Crews
and how much would that be?

83
00:04:58,537 --> 00:05:01,743
Ted Earley Financial Advisor to Charlie Crews
that's undisclosed by court order.

84
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:04,640
and what about details
of the settlement?

85
00:05:04,657 --> 00:05:06,990
I'm not at liberty to say.

86
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,803
Yeah, I-I heard he got $5
million. Can-- can I say?

87
00:05:09,818 --> 00:05:11,123
5? I heard it was 50.

88
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:15,010
So you wanna have the talk?

89
00:05:15,505 --> 00:05:16,913
Which talk is that?

90
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:18,420
About how you didn't
want me as your partner, 

91
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:21,190
and you're looking to transfer
out as soon as you can.

92
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:23,672
Nope. I don't wanna have that talk.

93
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:25,540
You wanna have the
talk about what you did?

94
00:05:25,556 --> 00:05:27,263
Who you pissed off to
get partnered up with me?

95
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:28,411
I was handed a slip of paper.

96
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:29,442
it said you're my new partner.

97
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:30,920
It didn't mention why, and I didn't ask.

98
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:33,212
Getting stuck with me isn't
exactly a promotion for you.

99
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:37,660
Detective, it might be a habit of yours, but I don't
wanna have the "what are you in for" talk either.

100
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:39,910
Not a big talker.

101
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:42,343
See, I've learned something
about you already.

102
00:05:43,246 --> 00:05:46,292
John was not my biological son.

103
00:05:46,307 --> 00:05:48,403
He was alyssa's from her first marriage.

104
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:52,450
We have another one
of our own, a daughter.

105
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:54,231
You adopted john?

106
00:05:54,246 --> 00:05:56,590
Yeah, I always think of him as my own.

107
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:58,270
As a member of the family.

108
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:02,312
I thought of--
thought of him as.

109
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:07,343
Where is john's biological father?

110
00:06:07,356 --> 00:06:08,650
Jail.

111
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:11,162
He's, uh.

112
00:06:11,178 --> 00:06:13,611
Possession with intent to distribute.

113
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:15,671
He's got ten more years.

114
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:22,341
The-- the scout
troop that john is a--

115
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:28,653
was a part of is made up entirely of
boys who have fathers who are doing time.

116
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,293
all right, we're almost through.

117
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:33,312
you reported a break-in last month?

118
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:35,813
Yeah, um.

119
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:38,832
Some cash and jewelry was
taken. No one was caught.

120
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:43,132
We changed the locks and the
alarms. Makes me paranoid.

121
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:44,982
- I-- what?I don't
understand. - Pot.

122
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:47,452
Just makes me, you
know, overprocess everything.

123
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:51,130
I end up spinning
myself into a freak-out.

124
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:53,432
you get high today, warren? yeah?

125
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,351
it's sunday. a little wake and bake?

126
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:59,110
because in the next few hours, there's gonna be all kinds
of law enforcement crawling all over your beautiful house.

127
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,732
- Detective.
- they turn up a
bag of high-grade chronic, well, 

128
00:07:01,748 --> 00:07:03,900
- I think you need to be herefor your family -
- detective.

129
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:06,042
- and you do not-
- detective!

130
00:07:06,105 --> 00:07:07,661
- May I speak with you?
- Sure thing.

131
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:09,301
Why don't you go to the bathroom?

132
00:07:09,318 --> 00:07:12,290
When you're done, make sure
you flush real well. okay?

133
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,820
you know, maybe flush
twice. you understand?

134
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:19,613
Excuse me.

135
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:23,252
What the hell was that?

136
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:26,170
What, you wanna see the dead boy's dad
get locked up for holding a little hay?

137
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:29,731
Stepdad, and a possible suspect
in a murder-- in a child murder.

138
00:07:29,748 --> 00:07:31,472
That man didn't kill
anyone, and you know it.

139
00:07:31,488 --> 00:07:33,913
He's got all his fingers, and
he seemed really sad.

140
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:35,222
You just broke the law.

141
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:36,441
I am your superior detective.

142
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,720
I'm responsible for your actions.

143
00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:39,880
If you get jammed up for
this, I get jammed up for this.

144
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,287
Hey, we're both adults here.

145
00:07:41,297 --> 00:07:43,671
You got a problem, turn
me over to the rat squad.

146
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:51,860
Are you gonna get that?

147
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:55,971
A phone this small in your
pocket. It's science fiction, right?

148
00:07:55,987 --> 00:07:58,001
This living
in the future--

149
00:08:03,747 --> 00:08:06,371
- was john having trouble in school?
- no.

150
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:08,771
- in the neighborhood?
- no.

151
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:11,112
other kids in the scout troop?

152
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:13,302
what about the break-in?

153
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:14,731
He was with me when that happened.

154
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:16,412
John had nothing to do with that.

155
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:18,720
I wasn't suggesting that, ma'am.

156
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:19,390
No, I'm sorry.

157
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:20,421
of course you weren't.

158
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:24,721
we're gonna need to ask you a few
questions about your ex-husband mark.

159
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:35,863
Mark wasn't a bad man
when I married him.

160
00:08:35,877 --> 00:08:38,132
He had a problem with drugs.

161
00:08:38,146 --> 00:08:41,193
But when he came out of jail
the first time, he'd changed.

162
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:43,072
He was mean.

163
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:45,381
when he went back in, I
knew I had to get away.

164
00:08:45,397 --> 00:08:48,392
so you just dumped the
divorce papers in the mail.

165
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:50,890
What did you just say?

166
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,691
What'd you just say?

167
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:54,511
What?

168
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:58,300
What did I just say?

169
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:02,981
two of the other dads in the scout troop
have records of violence against children, 

170
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:05,002
but both those dads are in jail.

171
00:09:06,256 --> 00:09:09,491
I'm gonna call in, see if they got
a hit off that finger we found.

172
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,210
It was pretty chewed up, but.

173
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:13,282
Okay, okay.

174
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:15,200
- you're mad at me.
- mad?No, I'm not mad.

175
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:17,831
I mean, I don't even think
there is a word for what I am.

176
00:09:17,846 --> 00:09:20,551
What you did to that
husband, I kinda get, okay?

177
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:22,921
I mean, I guess I kind of get, but
what you said to that wife--

178
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:24,922
I know.that one was me.

179
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:27,493
it was my fault. I take
responsibility, reese.

180
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:28,923
I wasn't in the moment.

181
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:33,570
If I had stayed in the moment, if I had stayed
present, I would have been okay, but I didn't.

182
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:37,061
I was thinking about
where we're going next.

183
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,402
So I left the moment just when I should
have been completely in the moment, 

184
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:43,310
which is when people usually leave the moment
because the moment is just too much for her.

185
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,952
I mean, the moment is pretty
much always too much, you know?

186
00:09:51,015 --> 00:09:54,113
I was thinking about
where we're going next.

187
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:01,453
Must feel good to come in
without a cavity search.

188
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,051
right, detective?

189
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:06,431
Course, you want one for old times'
sake, we could work something out.

190
00:10:06,446 --> 00:10:08,321
Just take us to rawls, okay?

191
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:10,802
Sure thing, sweetheart.

192
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:14,740
MAXIMUM SECURITY FACILITY

193
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:35,602
They won't let me go to his funeral.

194
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:37,933
My own son's funeral.

195
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:40,570
Mr.Rawls, I'd like for you to
think and see f you can help us.

196
00:10:40,588 --> 00:10:43,102
They won't let me go
to my son's funeral.

197
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:44,400
Why don't you help me?

198
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,572
You do not raise your voice to her.

199
00:10:46,586 --> 00:10:49,921
I want to do more than
raise my voice to her.

200
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:51,871
You gonna stop me?

201
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:55,461
Do you hate cops?

202
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:57,971
Oh, yeah.

203
00:10:57,985 --> 00:11:00,462
Well, I hate cops too.

204
00:11:04,006 --> 00:11:07,313
Mr.Rawls, have you made any enemies here in
prison that would want to hurt your family?

205
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:09,700
Get back at you by killing your son?

206
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,200
yeah, I got enemies.

207
00:11:14,217 --> 00:11:15,840
but none that would touch my son.

208
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:16,871
Why is that?

209
00:11:16,888 --> 00:11:19,372
Because everyone's got family.

210
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:22,692
That's right.

211
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:26,450
Everyone.

212
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:29,621
mr.Rawls, you last saw john two
weeks ago when the scout troop came.

213
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:31,881
how did he seem to you? was
he in any kind of trouble?

214
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:37,600
Last time I saw john, he kept saying
how he thought I shouldn't be here.

215
00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:43,202
It's like he needed to believe it.

216
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,662
No threats against his family.

217
00:11:47,675 --> 00:11:49,761
Not that we know, but we just work here.

218
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:50,932
We go home after our shifts.

219
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:54,161
It's the convicts who are here
24/7 that know what really goes on.

220
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:55,192
He means inmates.

221
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,301
He means convicts.

222
00:11:56,318 --> 00:11:58,683
What? you don't like that word?

223
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:00,421
What do you care?

224
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:03,103
Come on, crews. let's go.

225
00:12:03,117 --> 00:12:04,622
Yeah, we know who you are.

226
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:06,313
We know you did your 12 years.

227
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:08,841
Maybe you were innocent. maybe not.

228
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:13,300
It don't make no difference to us because we know what
you did to that correctional officer up in pelican bay, 

229
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,131
and that makes you a con. Don't it?

230
00:12:16,148 --> 00:12:18,102
You two need to escort us out now.

231
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:20,093
You getting angry, convict?

232
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:26,253
Anger ruins joy, steals
the goodness of my mind, 

233
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:28,432
forces my mouth to say terrible things.

234
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:32,010
Overcoming anger brings peace of
mind, leads to a mind without regrets.

235
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:36,391
If I overcome anger, I will be
delightful and loved by everyone.

236
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:38,072
Are you making fun of us?

237
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:41,092
It is the universe that
makes fun of us all.

238
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:52,812
Why exactly would the
universe make fun of us all?

239
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:54,641
Maybe it's insecure.

240
00:12:55,995 --> 00:12:59,020
to detach your feelings from the event.

241
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:02,363
to detach your feelings from the object.

242
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:05,703
I am not attached to this car.

243
00:13:07,117 --> 00:13:09,100
I am not attached to this car.

244
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:14,423
I'm just a little attached to this car.

245
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:40,220
so what is it this time?

246
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,890
License and registration.

247
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:44,063
You know damn well who I am.

248
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:46,053
License and registration, please.

249
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:49,892
Look, I married your
ex-wife. That is not a crime.

250
00:13:49,908 --> 00:13:52,720
Are you aware that you changed
lanes back there without signaling?

251
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:55,332
you have nothing better to do?

252
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:59,413
no, sir. Not at this moment.

253
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:04,680
********, okay, tyler?

254
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:05,533
yes, ma'am.

255
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:08,460
some of the other boys said that you
and john were close, is that right?

256
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:10,952
Yeah. I suppose.

257
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:12,890
Tyler, lift your head up when you speak.

258
00:14:13,346 --> 00:14:14,391
Ah, mushy.

259
00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:17,281
Did john ever talk to you about
any problems he was having?

260
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:18,990
Were there any new people in his life?

261
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:19,783
No, ma'am.

262
00:14:19,797 --> 00:14:22,052
That's the one. Green anjou.

263
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:24,152
You know, some people
are allergic to pears.

264
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:26,782
Gives them a rash. not me though.

265
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,832
Tyler.

266
00:14:28,847 --> 00:14:31,380
was john in any sort of trouble?

267
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:33,230
don't lie to this woman, tyler.

268
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:35,020
I'm not lying.

269
00:14:37,607 --> 00:14:42,631
Reese, I guess what I wanna say
is you've probably had to fight, 

270
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,341
being a woman in this department.
had to fight a lot, right?

271
00:14:45,356 --> 00:14:46,673
fight for everything you ever got?

272
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,543
detective crews, this is not
the place for that discussion.

273
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:50,520
Detective crews!

274
00:14:50,535 --> 00:14:51,713
- I just wanted
to s- - crews.

275
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,223
- I just wanted to let
you know that- - step back.

276
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:55,732
- You don't have to fight with me.
- Step back.

277
00:14:55,747 --> 00:14:57,440
She thinks I'm gonna hug her.

278
00:14:57,456 --> 00:14:58,732
You think I'm gonna hug you.

279
00:14:59,706 --> 00:15:02,163
as I hug my partner I know she is real.

280
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:06,381
I mindfully meet this person
with open arms and an open heart.

281
00:15:09,237 --> 00:15:11,222
I'm not gonna fight with you, I won't.

282
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:14,620
You don't wanna hold it
in anymore, do you, tyler?

283
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:17,361
What you know about
what happened to john.

284
00:15:17,756 --> 00:15:20,981
Something's inside you, but
you wanna let it out.

285
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:23,772
You don't wanna hold it in any
longer. You can't hold it in.

286
00:15:27,498 --> 00:15:29,320
What is it, tyler?

287
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:39,120
Some man-- some man offered to sell
john information about his dad's case.

288
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:42,080
about a technicality in the arrest.

289
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:45,321
he said that he could
get his dad out of jail.

290
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:46,701
Who was it?

291
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:48,421
I don't know.

292
00:15:48,436 --> 00:15:51,383
- tell them who this man was!
- I don't know!

293
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:53,593
We met him online.

294
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:55,313
He sent john an I.M.

295
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:57,552
I don't know who he really is.

296
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:00,332
An I.M. he sent john an
I.M.He sent john an I.M.

297
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:01,973
oh, my god!

298
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:04,313
why would you talk to some man online?

299
00:16:04,326 --> 00:16:07,142
Well, he knew all about his dad's
case. He said he was a lawyer.

300
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:09,081
John believed him?

301
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,420
He said if john paid, he'd get
stuff to show it was a bad arrest.

302
00:16:17,196 --> 00:16:19,590
he just wanted to get his dad out.

303
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:23,320
john just wanted to get his dad
out of jail, and now he's dead.

304
00:16:25,638 --> 00:16:27,712
I should have told somebody.

305
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:30,111
If I had told somebody, maybe.

306
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:32,390
Come here.

307
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:39,621
Reese, what exactly is an I.M.

308
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:46,753
What is it? an email?

309
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:49,603
is that detective charlie crews?

310
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:55,170
you know, I thought it was you, but I was kinda
blinded by the glint off that detective badge.

311
00:16:55,186 --> 00:16:57,701
Dani reese, bobby stark.

312
00:16:57,718 --> 00:17:00,962
No. are you charlie's new partner?

313
00:17:02,507 --> 00:17:04,552
We got something in common.

314
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:06,593
Oh, yeah. And what would that be?

315
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:08,660
Bobby and I used to be partners.

316
00:17:08,677 --> 00:17:11,933
Juarez, you see what a
big shot my ex-partner is?

317
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:13,872
Hey, can I get a picture? huh?

318
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:16,702
You know, on account of you being
a celebrity detective and all.

319
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:18,250
That's a phone, bobby.

320
00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:20,181
It's got a camera in
there. where you been?

321
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:23,281
Me? Been in federal
maximum security prison.

322
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:27,340
Come here.

323
00:17:27,668 --> 00:17:29,163
Charlie crews.

324
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:31,650
Does it bother you that he
spent all that time in the joint?

325
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:33,362
And what does that do to a guy's head?

326
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,423
I'm just saying, you sure he's gonna
be there when you go through a door?

327
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:40,851
Does it bother you that your pal stark let
his partner go down for a crime he didn't do?

328
00:17:40,865 --> 00:17:43,003
I mean, I'm just saying.

329
00:17:44,055 --> 00:17:46,292
Do I feel bad about what happened?

330
00:17:46,307 --> 00:17:48,093
Yeah, I feel bad.

331
00:17:48,107 --> 00:17:50,420
Do I feel guilty? no.

332
00:17:50,646 --> 00:17:52,251
'Cause I did my job.

333
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:55,183
There's an investigation, and
then there's a trial.

334
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:57,491
That's the way it works.

335
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:02,332
You wanted to see me?

336
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:06,220
Yeah, your parents missed you last night at the
wednesday night dinner, dani, you should come back.

337
00:18:06,237 --> 00:18:09,352
Oh, maybe my mom did, but I don't
think my dad missed me much.

338
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:10,921
He's not so bad.

339
00:18:10,935 --> 00:18:13,842
I sat in a car with your dad for
three years, and I came out alive.

340
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:16,143
Partners aren't parents, lieutenant.

341
00:18:20,107 --> 00:18:22,502
So. You've been working
the program, dani?

342
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:23,521
Is this where I pee in a cup?

343
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:26,232
No, this is where you tell me if
you've been working the program.

344
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:27,940
Yeah.

345
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:31,163
I've been working the program.

346
00:18:32,627 --> 00:18:34,123
Good.

347
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,820
It was a tough draw
getting a new partner.

348
00:18:36,836 --> 00:18:38,530
I'm just a lucky girl, I guess.

349
00:18:38,546 --> 00:18:40,422
Dani, you know why you got crews.

350
00:18:40,438 --> 00:18:42,330
Because I messed up.

351
00:18:42,695 --> 00:18:45,811
You know, I'm at the bottom of
the list, and there's not a--

352
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:48,222
there's not a whole
lot I can do about that.

353
00:18:48,237 --> 00:18:50,683
What if there was something
you could do about it?

354
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,483
How come we're talking about this?

355
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:54,083
Why did he come back to the force?

356
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:55,553
That's not my job to ask, l.T.

357
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,903
Crews is gonna be trouble.

358
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:00,553
He got screwed. he's back to get even.

359
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:02,293
- He's a cop.
- Because of his settlement.

360
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,701
You're a cop because of your work.

361
00:19:05,617 --> 00:19:10,622
You know, I was wondering who
it would be, who they would send.

362
00:19:10,635 --> 00:19:13,113
And I just kept thinking

363
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,910
"oh, you're being paranoid about this."

364
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:17,070
remember how paranoid
I used to get, l.T.?

365
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:20,163
You don't have to go
to prison to eat crap.

366
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:22,502
I eat it every day of my career.

367
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:25,270
it would be nice if you could keep
your head down and work the job.

368
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:27,543
The world isn't nice like that.

369
00:19:28,228 --> 00:19:29,531
This could be good for you, dani.

370
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:33,770
You're his superior, and you're responsible
for his supervision and actions.

371
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:36,170
he gets jammed up, I get jammed up?

372
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:40,033
Has he done anything that would
cause him to be removed from duty?

373
00:19:51,268 --> 00:19:54,540
He alerted a suspect that a
police search was about to happen.

374
00:19:58,507 --> 00:20:01,412
And detective crews apparently.

375
00:20:03,908 --> 00:20:07,973
Allowed the suspect to dispose
of a quantity of marijuana, 

376
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:12,350
to flush it down the toilet
just prior to the search.

377
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:19,432
How long have you lived here?

378
00:20:19,446 --> 00:20:20,462
Four months.

379
00:20:20,477 --> 00:20:22,443
When is all your furniture coming?

380
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:24,141
This is all my furniture.

381
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:26,713
hey, charlie!

382
00:20:27,815 --> 00:20:30,851
- charlie, I need you to sign something.
- Not now, ted.

383
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:32,872
I need you to sign this. look, hey.

384
00:20:32,887 --> 00:20:34,941
You were the one that said
you wanted this orange grove.

385
00:20:34,955 --> 00:20:37,401
if you changed your mind, I would
be happy to unwind the deal, 

386
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:38,560
- my friend-
- ted, not now.

387
00:20:38,577 --> 00:20:41,480
I'm, uh, I'm--
I'm meditating.

388
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:47,422
Well, that sounds. Peaceful.

389
00:20:47,438 --> 00:20:50,802
Uh, all right. I'm...

390
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:57,753
Hey, ted, the orange grove deal
includes the tractor, right?

391
00:20:57,768 --> 00:20:59,040
The big red one?

392
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:02,533
Yeah, charlie, it includes
the big red tractor.

393
00:21:02,546 --> 00:21:03,830
Who's that?

394
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,172
Do you read forbes?

395
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:07,261
I wasn't very good at prison.

396
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:09,331
Ted Earley Ex-CEO, Attercliffe Capital
you were in for a white-collar crime?

397
00:21:10,528 --> 00:21:12,451
Ted Earley Ex-CEO, Attercliffe Capital
insider trading.yeah.

398
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:18,671
Charlie saved my life in there, and
so now I handle his settlement money.

399
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:20,940
and you live in his garage?

400
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:24,142
I live in a room above his garage.

401
00:21:34,908 --> 00:21:36,711
Do you wanna know my name?

402
00:21:36,726 --> 00:21:39,732
If I wanted to know your name, I
would have asked you for it.

403
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:43,131
So that means you're not gonna call?

404
00:21:43,145 --> 00:21:46,583
I can't call if I don't
know your name, now, can I?

405
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:49,640
I.M. Stands for instant message.

406
00:21:49,656 --> 00:21:50,443
I know that.

407
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,571
You can't trace an I.M.

408
00:21:51,586 --> 00:21:53,751
Detective, I know that too.

409
00:21:54,388 --> 00:21:55,342
You know we have to see her.

410
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:57,500
- Because it went so well last time?
- I'll be better this time.

411
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:59,353
- you're not gonna talk this time.
- That's what I mean by better.

412
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:02,363
Look, I know the deal with your
ex-wife, all right, it's no secret.

413
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:06,131
so just tell me that we're gonna go
see alyssa gibney because of the case, 

414
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:08,903
and not because of something
that you're working through.

415
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:11,652
I'm workg thinugh the case.

416
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,373
She doesn't want to see you.

417
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:16,503
Uh, does she want to see anybody?

418
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:17,690
She won't come downstairs.

419
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,082
She won't look at her daughter
or talk to her husband.

420
00:22:20,098 --> 00:22:22,240
I'll tell her you tried to stop us.

421
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:37,073
my husband told me about you.

422
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:41,812
A cop in jail all those years.

423
00:22:42,548 --> 00:22:44,671
How did you go on living?

424
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:48,160
How did you get past it?

425
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:51,730
Well, I could tell you
you're already past it.

426
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,813
I could tell you this
moment is your life.

427
00:22:54,828 --> 00:22:58,451
I could tell you you have a
husband and child who need you.

428
00:22:59,015 --> 00:23:01,401
None of that means anything, does it?

429
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:04,780
So tell me something
that means something.

430
00:23:05,388 --> 00:23:09,331
Tell me anything that means something.

431
00:23:18,476 --> 00:23:23,072
The man who killed your
son is out there. Right now.

432
00:23:23,587 --> 00:23:27,030
Inside this same moment we are in.

433
00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:30,873
As we sit here, as I look at you, 

434
00:23:30,885 --> 00:23:34,530
the man who killed john is free.

435
00:23:35,425 --> 00:23:38,641
Now that means something, doesn't it?

436
00:23:39,988 --> 00:23:43,611
we're pretty sure someone was
running a scam on your son, alyssa, 

437
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:47,670
offering to sell him information
about his father's arrest.

438
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:49,891
about a technicality that could
get his father out of jail.

439
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:52,290
that's ridiculous. mark is guilty.

440
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,081
John knew that.

441
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:56,133
Even mark will tell you he's guilty.

442
00:23:56,145 --> 00:24:00,860
And if there was a technicality, why
go with it to a child?

443
00:24:05,065 --> 00:24:07,121
Because my son.

444
00:24:07,135 --> 00:24:09,450
- A child- -
would believe it.

445
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:13,761
Because a child would wanna
believe he could get his father out.

446
00:24:13,775 --> 00:24:16,230
- Because a child- -
would pay to believe it.

447
00:24:16,245 --> 00:24:18,621
We need to know, alyssa.

448
00:24:19,737 --> 00:24:22,422
John stole that money, didn't he?

449
00:24:23,826 --> 00:24:25,433
Yes.

450
00:24:26,737 --> 00:24:31,522
I lied to my husband when I
said that john was with me.

451
00:24:32,008 --> 00:24:35,851
I lied for him because I loved him.

452
00:24:36,856 --> 00:24:40,550
He'd been through so much those
early years with mark.And I--

453
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:46,710
he's in the same moment that we're in.

454
00:24:47,717 --> 00:24:50,103
The man who killed my son.

455
00:24:51,647 --> 00:24:54,831
Will you go get him, please?

456
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:02,671
Yeah.

457
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,370
Uh, it's for you.

458
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:13,763
Hello?

459
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:15,222
charlie?

460
00:25:15,237 --> 00:25:17,562
you're aware this isn't my phone?

461
00:25:17,578 --> 00:25:20,143
When you answer your phone, I'll
call you on your phone.

462
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:21,561
I need to see you.

463
00:25:21,576 --> 00:25:23,150
I'm fighting crime.

464
00:25:24,475 --> 00:25:27,443
Come over tonight. I'll buy fruit.

465
00:25:30,348 --> 00:25:32,310
I don't exactly understand you.

466
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:35,473
You don't have to
understand here to be here.

467
00:25:35,776 --> 00:25:38,300
That's what I don't understand.

468
00:25:38,316 --> 00:25:40,623
What was crews like before?

469
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:43,420
Basic by-the-book
cop. you know.

470
00:25:43,777 --> 00:25:46,110
Looking for his 20 and his pension.

471
00:25:47,157 --> 00:25:49,213
Why? what's he like now?

472
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:03,090
You wanna find out about
somebody, all you have to do is google.

473
00:26:03,107 --> 00:26:05,523
I google myself all the time.

474
00:26:05,788 --> 00:26:09,053
Google the kid's dad, mark rawls.

475
00:26:14,347 --> 00:26:16,910
well, that's more than enough
to work a scam on a kid.

476
00:26:16,927 --> 00:26:18,580
google me.

477
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,420
You want to see me?

478
00:26:21,437 --> 00:26:23,331
You don't wanna see that, charlie.

479
00:26:23,345 --> 00:26:25,671
Do it. Do it.

480
00:26:40,818 --> 00:26:41,801
GOT FRAMED?

481
00:26:41,816 --> 00:26:43,443
12 years for a crime he did not commit

482
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,913
your father's been calling me.

483
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:05,131
twice today.

484
00:27:05,145 --> 00:27:07,263
Three times yesterday.

485
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:08,263
Do you want some melon?

486
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:10,152
It's very fresh and juicy.

487
00:27:10,946 --> 00:27:12,711
Are you not talking about this?

488
00:27:12,726 --> 00:27:15,111
I'd ask you to address all
your questions to my lawyer.

489
00:27:15,126 --> 00:27:16,361
I am your lawyer.

490
00:27:16,377 --> 00:27:18,970
- Your father is getting married.
- No.

491
00:27:19,316 --> 00:27:20,562
he's getting remarried.

492
00:27:20,578 --> 00:27:21,770
He wants you to come.

493
00:27:21,785 --> 00:27:24,091
His bride to be is eight years old.

494
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:26,613
Either way. I don't have a date.

495
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:30,803
From what I hear, you
have plenty of dates.

496
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:35,710
Charlie. Please call your father.

497
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:38,291
If only so he will stop calling me.

498
00:27:39,196 --> 00:27:44,550
My father is getting remarried to an
eight-year-old because my mother is dead.

499
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:47,811
My mother is dead because he killed her.

500
00:27:47,828 --> 00:27:50,980
He killed her when he
wouldn't let her come see me.

501
00:27:51,787 --> 00:27:53,601
No zen for daddy?

502
00:27:53,615 --> 00:27:55,782
No zen for daddy.

503
00:28:03,687 --> 00:28:05,180
Hey.

504
00:28:05,696 --> 00:28:07,790
- where'd you go?
- I'm still here.

505
00:28:13,598 --> 00:28:17,520
Do you ever think that no one
will ever understand what we did?

506
00:28:19,527 --> 00:28:21,891
What you and I came through?

507
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:28,140
Do you ever think that the world is now you
and me in one place, everyone else in another?

508
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:35,370
Sorry.I'm sorry. that's stupid.

509
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:41,033
I think that all the time.

510
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:56,603
It's late.

511
00:28:57,398 --> 00:28:59,430
I should go.

512
00:29:02,026 --> 00:29:03,252
Yeah.

513
00:29:10,235 --> 00:29:12,201
I'm not attached to this car.

514
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:14,430
I am not attached to this car.

515
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:18,330
call from dani reese.

516
00:29:18,346 --> 00:29:20,510
- hello?
- hello.

517
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,463
crews, you there?

518
00:29:21,476 --> 00:29:23,301
reese? am I talking to you?

519
00:29:23,316 --> 00:29:25,601
what do you mean are you talking
to me? you're talkin' to me.

520
00:29:25,616 --> 00:29:27,720
- But how am I talking to you?
- crews!

521
00:29:27,737 --> 00:29:29,231
we got a hit off the finger you dug up.

522
00:29:29,246 --> 00:29:30,680
A junkie named lonnie garth.

523
00:29:30,697 --> 00:29:35,050
He's got no known address, but he hangs
out at those crack houses downtown.

524
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,443
I'm sending you his mug shot right now.

525
00:29:38,925 --> 00:29:40,023
To my house?

526
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:41,332
to your phone.

527
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:48,003
- it's like- -
living in the future?

528
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:52,930
actually, I thought about that, and it turns
out there really is no future or past either.

529
00:29:52,947 --> 00:29:55,902
just
now.and n--

530
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:57,442
and of course now.

531
00:29:57,918 --> 00:29:59,543
Reese?

532
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:01,991
Reese?

533
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:05,620
all units.All units. suspect
located at 5th and main.

534
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:07,381
all units. All units.

535
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,751
why'd you become a cop again?

536
00:30:12,035 --> 00:30:15,913
When I was doing all that time, I always
thought, inside me I'm still a cop.

537
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:17,491
It's what I held on to.

538
00:30:17,505 --> 00:30:20,711
Wow, that sounds like a lot of crap.

539
00:30:20,725 --> 00:30:22,563
A lot of life is a lot of crap.

540
00:30:22,576 --> 00:30:24,162
This is
command--

541
00:30:25,818 --> 00:30:28,960
well, if I'm in all those years, I'm
just thinking about one thing.

542
00:30:29,276 --> 00:30:31,180
Was I set up for that murder?

543
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:35,360
- Is that what you'd be thinking?
- Yeah.

544
00:30:36,325 --> 00:30:38,452
That and what I'd do once I
found the guys that set me up.

545
00:30:38,468 --> 00:30:40,782
- You ever think about any of that?
- Nope.

546
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:43,582
I'm thinking about finding
a nine-fingered crackhead.

547
00:30:51,106 --> 00:30:52,993
I can see you, devils!

548
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:56,771
I know you come to get me
for what happened to that kid.

549
00:30:56,785 --> 00:30:57,763
lonnie garth?

550
00:30:57,777 --> 00:30:59,241
Devils know my name.

551
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:01,500
You need to come out here, so
we can arrest you for murder.

552
00:31:01,515 --> 00:31:04,422
I never ever killed
that kid! arthur did!

553
00:31:04,437 --> 00:31:06,871
arthur killed that kid!

554
00:31:10,698 --> 00:31:11,852
- good morning!
- good morning.

555
00:31:11,865 --> 00:31:13,620
did you just wake up?

556
00:31:13,927 --> 00:31:17,893
that arthur, he just wanted the money, but
the kid, he wouldn't give it to him.

557
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:21,120
he just started
yelling, so arthur shot him!

558
00:31:21,135 --> 00:31:25,662
and his dog wouldn't stop yelling
at me, and it took my finger!

559
00:31:26,377 --> 00:31:28,041
arthur just wanted the money!

560
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:29,580
arthur have a last name?

561
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,563
arthur killed that kid!

562
00:31:31,578 --> 00:31:37,041
but I watched-- I watched arthur
kill that kid, and I didn't stop him!

563
00:31:37,057 --> 00:31:40,561
I watched arthur kill that
kid, and I didn't stop him!

564
00:31:44,566 --> 00:31:46,990
I've been waiting for you!

565
00:31:54,275 --> 00:31:55,352
reese?

566
00:31:55,366 --> 00:31:58,193
I'm okay!I'm okay. I'm not shot.

567
00:32:24,256 --> 00:32:26,030
uh, I'm goin' now.

568
00:32:32,137 --> 00:32:34,893
I'm going--
I'm going now.

569
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:38,850
I never ever killed that kid.

570
00:32:40,748 --> 00:32:43,461
I'm going. I'm going now.

571
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,771
it was just a bad dream.

572
00:32:50,397 --> 00:32:52,892
Go back to sleep.

573
00:33:06,005 --> 00:33:07,380
Reese?

574
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:09,330
Reese!

575
00:33:13,887 --> 00:33:17,131
Oh, god. get it off me.Drugs.

576
00:33:17,146 --> 00:33:18,710
Oh, god. help me.

577
00:33:19,075 --> 00:33:20,692
Please, please, please, turn the water on.

578
00:33:20,706 --> 00:33:22,791
Turn the damn water on!

579
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:24,400
Crews!

580
00:33:37,636 --> 00:33:38,801
Yeah.

581
00:33:57,767 --> 00:34:00,033
Hey, you wanna talk about
what happened back there?

582
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:01,882
The drugs? the shower?

583
00:34:04,306 --> 00:34:07,100
Well. We don't have to talk about it.

584
00:34:07,927 --> 00:34:09,991
We never have to talk about it.

585
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:13,503
you know, he said he
never killed that kid.

586
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:14,680
do we believe that?

587
00:34:14,696 --> 00:34:17,960
he seem like the kinda guy who
could run a complicated I.M.Scam?

588
00:34:17,977 --> 00:34:19,651
No, he didn't.

589
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,923
He said a guy named
arthur killed the kid.

590
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:27,240
Okay, so then how would arthur get
a hold of john gibney's screen name?

591
00:34:27,256 --> 00:34:30,203
There's a directory for the
parents in the scout troop.

592
00:34:30,646 --> 00:34:32,932
Let's go see if there are
any parents named arthur.

593
00:34:34,498 --> 00:34:38,123
Arthur tins, a dad in the scout troop, served
two years for credit card scams, 

594
00:34:38,136 --> 00:34:39,712
paroled six months ago.

595
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:41,201
Hey, arthur.

596
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,830
- How you doin'?
- Good.

597
00:34:52,078 --> 00:34:54,022
Why would you show me that?

598
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:55,931
Does it make you uncomfortable?

599
00:34:55,947 --> 00:34:58,703
No, it makes me sad. I
have a child of my own.

600
00:35:02,145 --> 00:35:04,062
Wait, I know that boy.

601
00:35:04,627 --> 00:35:05,701
He's in my son's troop.

602
00:35:05,715 --> 00:35:09,292
- His name is, um, john something.
- John gibney.

603
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:10,850
- yeah.
- yeah.

604
00:35:10,868 --> 00:35:12,231
say his name.

605
00:35:15,145 --> 00:35:17,320
No, I don't think I'll do that.

606
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:19,942
Next time I ask, you will.

607
00:35:20,336 --> 00:35:22,251
john figured out you were full of crap.

608
00:35:22,266 --> 00:35:24,410
you had nothing to free his dad, 

609
00:35:24,425 --> 00:35:27,052
but he wouldn't tell you where
the money was, so you killed him.

610
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:30,221
By now you've searched my
house, my office, and my computer.

611
00:35:30,236 --> 00:35:35,162
and I know that you have found
nothing at my house, in my office.

612
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:41,442
or on my computer. Aren't you that
cop that spent all that time in jail?

613
00:35:42,026 --> 00:35:43,921
That must have sucked.

614
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:46,813
Lonnie garth said you
killed that kid, arthur.

615
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:49,670
You kinda lost it when
he wouldn't pay up.

616
00:35:49,686 --> 00:35:53,031
lonnie garth the dead crackhead?
you're going to court with that?

617
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:57,450
We're curious about the phone calls
between your client and lonnie garth.

618
00:35:57,468 --> 00:35:59,051
What's it like being famous?

619
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:02,943
a record of those phone calls
proves nothing. we are done here.

620
00:36:06,015 --> 00:36:08,853
maybe he can explain
the calls, maybe he can't.

621
00:36:08,865 --> 00:36:12,453
The fact remains that your client has
been communicating with a known felon.

622
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:14,091
A parole violation?

623
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:17,130
that's what you bring to
me? a parole violation?

624
00:36:17,148 --> 00:36:19,740
What does that carry, like, a
year? I do that in my sleep.

625
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:21,791
A year for killing a kid.

626
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:28,960
I need a drink.

627
00:36:29,305 --> 00:36:31,010
I know something better.

628
00:36:35,548 --> 00:36:36,933
Mango?

629
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:38,743
It's okay.

630
00:36:39,076 --> 00:36:42,520
This came all the way from guatemala, and
now it's right here in this cup.

631
00:36:43,447 --> 00:36:45,111
It's all connected, reese.

632
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:46,463
What is?

633
00:36:46,478 --> 00:36:47,590
it is.

634
00:36:49,148 --> 00:36:51,340
- that's zen.
- is it?

635
00:36:51,895 --> 00:36:54,350
- that's zen too, isn't it?
- is it?

636
00:36:54,365 --> 00:36:56,703
Say "is it" one more
time, and I'll shoot you.

637
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,091
Don't you two ever give up?

638
00:37:10,505 --> 00:37:14,270
Hey, detective reese, isn't
that mark rawls over there?

639
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:16,703
I think you're right, detective crews.

640
00:37:16,715 --> 00:37:20,040
hey, uh, you know mark
rawls, don't you, arthur?

641
00:37:20,727 --> 00:37:23,872
you told his son you could get him out
of jail, then you broke his son's heart.

642
00:37:23,887 --> 00:37:25,312
Then you killed him.

643
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:26,620
I'm gonna need protective lockup.

644
00:37:26,638 --> 00:37:28,340
For a parole violation?

645
00:37:28,677 --> 00:37:31,713
- you're only here for a year.
- You can do that in your sleep.

646
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:39,741
Send me somewhere now, and
I'll-- and I'll-- and I'll talk.

647
00:37:39,755 --> 00:37:40,772
Start talkin' now.

648
00:37:40,785 --> 00:37:42,433
I killed the kid.

649
00:37:44,216 --> 00:37:46,533
arthur.say his name.

650
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:49,410
John gibney. I killed john gibney.

651
00:37:49,428 --> 00:37:50,712
What was that, arthur? I didn't catch it.

652
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:52,931
John gibney. I killed john gibney.

653
00:37:52,947 --> 00:37:54,173
Why?

654
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:55,532
Because he saw my face.

655
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:58,813
Lonnie always got the money, but the kid wouldn't
give it to him, so lonnie brought the kid to me.

656
00:37:58,825 --> 00:38:00,761
And john wouldn't give
you the money either.

657
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:02,221
Let's go.

658
00:38:04,687 --> 00:38:08,050
Lonnie was supposed to get the money. He
wasn't supposed to see me.he saw my face.

659
00:38:17,158 --> 00:38:18,921
It is all connected.

660
00:38:33,517 --> 00:38:37,860
I thought you'd want to know the department is
prepared to go ahead with the complaint against crews.

661
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:39,432
What complaint is that?

662
00:38:39,448 --> 00:38:43,882
That you saw him allow a suspect to flush
a controlled substance down the toilet.

663
00:38:43,895 --> 00:38:45,562
But I didn't see that.

664
00:38:46,565 --> 00:38:51,733
I said that he apparently flushed those
drugs because I did not see that happen.

665
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:54,101
I mean, I don't know
exactly what happened.

666
00:38:54,118 --> 00:38:56,642
I'm not sure I understand you, dani.

667
00:38:59,287 --> 00:39:01,821
You don't have to
understand here to be here.

668
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:04,573
Is this a problem for you because
of your own history with drugs?

669
00:39:04,585 --> 00:39:06,513
- I went to rehab for that.
- Yeah.

670
00:39:06,526 --> 00:39:08,683
I've been clean for 21 months.

671
00:39:08,697 --> 00:39:12,903
Even with rehab, the department
doesn't have to keep you on the job.

672
00:39:14,217 --> 00:39:16,360
You didn't get a settlement, dani.

673
00:39:17,895 --> 00:39:20,603
So the next time crews does something.

674
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:23,422
I need to make sure I do see it.

675
00:39:25,927 --> 00:39:31,161
Life was his sentence, and
life is what he got back.

676
00:39:31,606 --> 00:39:33,682
what do you think he
should do with that life?

677
00:39:36,238 --> 00:39:38,432
that would be up to him.

678
00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:34,333
FOLLOW THE MONEY

679
00:40:41,836 --> 00:40:42,890
COMPROMISED DNA

680
00:40:49,018 --> 00:40:50,900
40K IN WIFE'S ACCOUNT

681
00:40:54,027 --> 00:40:55,640
MISSING

682
00:41:11,895 --> 00:41:12,751
HE COULD NOT HAVE SEEN

683
00:41:41,655 --> 00:41:43,530
you wanna drive the tractor.

684
00:41:44,406 --> 00:41:46,692
You know, I, uh.

685
00:41:47,445 --> 00:41:49,281
I sorta do.

686
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:03,262
- Hey, ted.
- Yeah.

687
00:42:03,275 --> 00:42:05,551
Exactly where are the oranges?

688
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:10,210
Oh, they're out of season in this part
of california for another six months.

689
00:42:10,876 --> 00:42:12,211
You in a rush?

690
00:42:14,555 --> 00:42:16,351
Actually, no.

691
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:18,823
I'm not.

692
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:22,830
this is not forward!

693
00:42:22,845 --> 00:42:23,851
That's not forward!

694
00:42:23,868 --> 00:42:25,380
this is not forward!

695
00:42:28,185 --> 00:42:30,011
Oh, god, that's bad. I'm sorry.

696
00:42:30,585 --> 00:42:32,932
Oh, god. I'm very sorry, charlie.

697
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:35,750
I'm so sorry!
I will--

698
