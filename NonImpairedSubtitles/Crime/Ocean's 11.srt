1
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,649
Christmas in Beverly Hills, California.

2
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:17,352
A time when everyone thinks only kind,
tolerant, generous thoughts.

3
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,272
- I went looking for you.
- What? What, what?

4
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,611
What is it, Mushy?

5
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,854
- I went to the house looking for you.
- Why? What happened?

6
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,321
Nothing.
I thought you needed me for something.

7
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,621
Heart attacks.
That's what I need all of you for.

8
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,028
Phoenix, Arizona calling, Mr. Acebos.

9
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,835
Hello?

10
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,733
Yes, Operator, speaking.

11
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,667
Mr. Ocean doesn't answer?

12
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,409
Still doesn't answer. And Mr. Foster?

13
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,540
Of course, keep calling.

14
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,981
They've got to come in sometime.

15
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,617
Hello?

16
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,051
Jimmy, are you in yet?

17
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,151
You don't even expect me.

18
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,395
Sorry, Operator, Mr. Foster is out.

19
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,158
So is Mr. Ocean.

20
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,366
I made a cardinal rule...

21
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,100
...never to answer the phone
during the month of December.

22
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,108
That's crazy. Why?

23
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:42,408
Because one December,
every time I picked up the phone...

24
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:46,009
...they used to send me out in the snow
to play with my friends.

25
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,912
That was at the Bulge.

26
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,390
Clowns, they've got to be.

27
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,225
I like clowns, but they should be funny.

28
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,690
It's a clown's business being funny.

29
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,128
And I ask you:

30
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,396
What is funny about going to the pokey
for 10 years?

31
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,637
To me, in all sincerity, nothing.

32
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,231
Agreed. Yet that's exactly where we'll be...

33
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,211
...unless every bit of timing
is checked and rechecked.

34
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,275
One more question:

35
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,078
Inform me frankly...

36
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,546
...what have I done to earn contempt?

37
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,721
Why should I be treated
like I am stupid and they are smart?

38
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,794
That's right.
It was your scheme in the first place.

39
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,789
So was the Hialeah racetrack job...

40
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:36,000
...Hegan's supermarket and the key switch
on Nelson's armored cars.

41
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,003
All my inspirations.

42
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,906
There isn't a man in the country
with my reputation.

43
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,372
And so why don't those fellows
respect me?

44
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,579
Maybe because you don't do nothing.

45
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,114
You just get ideas.

46
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,444
I just get ideas.

47
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,483
If you're not careful, buddy boy,
she'll rub you out.

48
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,563
Acebos. He's insistent.

49
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,223
This is a recording.
You've dialed the right number.

50
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,769
Now please hang up and don't do it again.

51
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,800
- Where were we?
- Right here.

52
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,500
That man is going to flip.

53
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,908
He silver-tongued us into the deal.
Let him sweat.

54
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,709
He didn't silver-tongue you for long.

55
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,074
Thirty seconds, give or take a few.

56
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,678
You couldn't expect me to turn down
a nice business opportunity like this.

57
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,353
Especially where there's no risk factor.

58
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,517
I wouldn't have it any other way.

59
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,990
Isn't it time we looked up Vince Massler?

60
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,423
I saw him. He doesn't want in.

61
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,689
Why not?

62
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,529
Beats the hell out of me, Sergeant.

63
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:49,598
I took him by the ears and dragged him
from Solano to the Siegfried line.

64
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,509
I may have to do it again.

65
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,704
Maybe this time he'll come gently.

66
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:58,346
All right, girls, time for your nap. Beat it.

67
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,918
- Hey!
- See you later.

68
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,253
- Up, lover-boy. Get up.
- You're a spoilsport.

69
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,029
Sam Harmon's coming in at 3:00.
Should I go to the airport?

70
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,124
I sent Steffans to the airport.

71
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,474
Everything to the last minute.

72
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,535
This Harmon should have been
in on the scam weeks ago.

73
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,606
The whole crew should.

74
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,880
What about this Sam Harmon?

75
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,221
Why all the way from Hawaii?
What's so special?

76
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,282
And who says he can be trusted?

77
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,721
Sam Harmon is Ocean's closest friend.

78
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,758
- Another "closest friend"?
- Yeah.

79
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:46,992
What about Foster?

80
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,966
Before Foster. From way back.

81
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,801
We were all in the Commandoes together
and Ocean saved Harmon's life.

82
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:55,798
Hey, Sam.

83
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,640
Sam Harmon!

84
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,413
All right, that takes care of me.
Now let's get to you.

85
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,546
George Steffans.

86
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,182
Curly. Curly Steffans.

87
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,913
Curly, of course, I'd know you anywhere.

88
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,985
You haven't changed either.
You look great, kid.

89
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,395
Listen, is Danny really going to go through
with this commando raid?

90
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,123
Just like the old days.

91
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,525
Well, who is this Acebos guy? What is he?

92
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,569
Planning division. He dreamed it up.
Not the tactics though.

93
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,161
Jimmy and Danny
worked out the coordination job.

94
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,604
What is he, a con?

95
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,034
Leavenworth.

96
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,641
Where did Danny meet him?

97
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,873
Who knows?
A racetrack, a nightclub, Disneyland.

98
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,249
- Same old Danny.
- Yeah, he likes action.

99
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:40,342
- Is he still married?
- Yeah, but he's not working at it.

100
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,547
That figures. Hup, soldier, fatigue detail.

101
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,821
Put this footlocker in my car. Hold it.

102
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,204
What can I do for you?

103
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:12,141
- I would like to see the proprietor.
- You're looking at him.

104
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,344
- Doesn't Tony Bergdorf own this shop?
- Not anymore.

105
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,889
Can you tell me where I can find him?
I'm a friend of his.

106
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,092
That's him. That's me.

107
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,357
What I'm going to tell you
isn't a very nice thing to hear.

108
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:30,732
He's in prison.

109
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,730
- Tony Bergdorf?
- San Quentin.

110
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,170
Can you tell me where I can find his wife?

111
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,403
I have her address here someplace.

112
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,978
I'll get it for you in a minute.

113
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,312
- May I make a long-distance call?
- Long-distance?

114
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,109
I'll have it reversed.

115
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,543
All right.

116
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,845
Thank you.

117
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,925
- Mr. Corneal calling.
- I'll take the call.

118
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,830
Go ahead.

119
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:05,132
- Hello, Corneal? It's me, Mushy.
- Again it's not Phoenix.

120
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,397
This is Acebos. Go ahead, Corneal.

121
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:11,102
Tony Bergdorf is in San Quentin
doing from one to five.

122
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,318
He's in prison, the electrician.

123
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:25,717
Our master electrician is doing one to five.

124
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,994
Make it a little shorter, will you, please?

125
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,387
Here we are, Ms. Allenby.

126
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,595
Thank you so much, Mrs. Bergdorf.
Mr. Allenby will be so pleased.

127
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,864
They're our very own children, you know.

128
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,964
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye and thank you so much.

129
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,033
Mommy's so pleased to have you home.

130
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,100
Gracie!

131
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,977
Roger Corneal!

132
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,914
- Where did you come from?
- It's been a long time. How are you?

133
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,477
It's been a lifetime.
It was our first anniversary, wasn't it?

134
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,319
Do you remember those rum drinks
at the Traders?

135
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,790
I haven't had rum since.

136
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,624
Those were the olden, golden days,
weren't they?

137
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,329
- Do you know about Tony?
- Yes. It's a shame.

138
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:13,502
- He's getting out tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow? I thought he had one to five.

139
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,473
They did, but they gave him an amnesty.
I don't know why.

140
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,533
That Danny, always a step ahead.

141
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,579
- Pardon me?
- I'm just mumbling.

142
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,539
Will you have Tony call me
when he gets home? Tell him to call me...

143
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,347
He won't be coming home, Roger.
That's all finished.

144
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,286
I didn't know that. Won't he see the kid?

145
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,289
Sure, he'll see Timmy, but he'll see him
at the Peninsula Military School...

146
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,521
...in the presence of Major Taylor.

147
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,130
- Can I use your phone, Gracie?
- Sure.

148
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:45,593
I just can't ignore the possibility
of him being a bad influence on Timmy.

149
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,890
This time it must be Ocean.

150
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,218
- Hello.
- Mr. Corneal calling.

151
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,694
- Who?
- Mr. Corneal.

152
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,231
- Corneal again.
- Will you accept the call?

153
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,765
Yes, I'll accept the call.

154
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,299
That man sure likes telephones.

155
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,738
Come on in, boys. I'll be right with you.

156
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,902
Hey, Sam.

157
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,341
Get them up.

158
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,180
You look great. Is that what a diet
of wahines does for a guy?

159
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,877
You get them up now.

160
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,716
Go ahead, shoot one in there.

161
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,813
Please, fellows, I can't hear.

162
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,188
You look almost human.
Have you quit fighting?

163
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,785
Yes, Sam, I was running out of scar tissue.

164
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,131
Hold it a minute, Corneal.

165
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,793
Avail yourself of my hospitality,
Mr. Harmon.

166
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,229
- Scotch?
- Scotch.

167
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,334
- Tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow morning?

168
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,268
Wait. Yes, proceed.

169
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,807
- Just listen.
- Sure, I'm listening.

170
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,641
And I'm a very happy man.

171
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,047
No, I said I'm... Never mind. Go on.

172
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,316
Thanks, Corneal. It's just...

173
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:09,910
It's excellent what you did.
Yes, excellent. Good-bye.

174
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,153
Another crisis lived through.

175
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,526
They're letting Bergdorf out.

176
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,286
Giving him an amnesty.

177
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,760
Some joke.

178
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:25,001
I bet Ocean knew it all the time,
but he wouldn't tell me.

179
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,334
No, he wouldn't.

180
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,704
He's got to torture me.

181
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:33,472
Eat my heart out. He likes it.

182
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,344
You're not going to make yourself popular
knocking Danny.

183
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,014
Who's knocking him? I love him.

184
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,619
I respect talent.

185
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:46,449
- All I'm asking, he should love me a little.
- Too tough. Don't ask.

186
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,999
How about that, fellows?
A little hand for Lolita.

187
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,967
Now, a sweet little bundle from Texas,
sweet as chocolate candy.

188
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,441
The tantalizing...

189
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,106
...Honey Face.

190
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,132
Sorry about the interruption, boys,
I got a job to do.

191
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,639
What's the word, Vince?
We have to catch a plane.

192
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,504
I never figured you'd go this route.

193
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,409
Vince, the plan is foolproof.
Take my word for it.

194
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,642
You know I only lie to girls.

195
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,615
If it's so foolproof,
why hasn't somebody done it yet?

196
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,517
Same reason nobody's gone
to the moon yet: No equipment.

197
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,746
We're equipped.

198
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:26,120
It's going to be a military operation
executed by trained men.

199
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,327
Why waste all those cute little tricks
the Army taught us...

200
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,919
...just because it's sort of peaceful now?

201
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,893
You remember a little bit
called Operation Gold in Oran?

202
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,660
Do I?

203
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,335
Eleven of us on a beach
with a rubber boat...

204
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:43,405
...and $6 million in gold bars.

205
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,338
- We should've buried them.
- No shovels.

206
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,312
But we got shovels this time.

207
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,274
What do you say, Vince?

208
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,976
I can't do it, boys, I got my wife to think of.

209
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,316
- Think of her rich.
- Think of me dead.

210
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,285
Stop talking like a kid.

211
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,787
You got through the war without dying.
Why should you die in peacetime?

212
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,761
Vince, you're indestructible.

213
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:08,763
I'm sorry, fellows. I'd go along with you
in a minute, but my wife...

214
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,893
When does she come on?

215
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,994
She's on.

216
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:22,907
Is that her?

217
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:27,011
- Why? What are you thinking?
- She's a very lovely girl.

218
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:31,613
I'd like to wrap you up, take you home,
and spread you on my waffle.

219
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,067
There's only two of them.

220
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,733
First, he's begging for a job,
now he's dumping paying customers.

221
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,276
- Let's get the bum out of here.
- Okay, Al.

222
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,875
- Now?
- Now's the time.

223
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,676
- What's the matter with you, boys?
- Hold it, pal.

224
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,718
What's the big idea?

225
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,356
- Stop it.
- Go that way.

226
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,827
- Come on.
- Right, Al.

227
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,049
It didn't figure to come across
a pier-six brawl like this, and so far inland.

228
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,421
If you still want me, Danny, I'm in.

229
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:44,491
All right, you're in.
It could be a little itchy.

230
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,258
I don't care.

231
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,061
I'm tired of having those bums
yelling at my wife.

232
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,932
I don't want her to have to take it
one more lousy night.

233
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,495
Neither do l, Vince.

234
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,739
Here, take that.

235
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,173
- Shucks, Danny.
- Cut out the Gunsmoke dialogue.

236
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,339
Here's a plane ticket.
When you get there...

237
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,112
Go to this address. Ask for Josh Howard.
He'll tell you what to do.

238
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,216
- Josh Howard's in with you?
- Yes.

239
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,879
I feel better already.

240
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,988
Good.

241
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,818
Heard anything about Louis Jackson?
Where he might be?

242
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,987
Salt Lake City, last I heard.

243
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,759
Yeah, we heard that, too.

244
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,260
We'll see you in a couple of days.

245
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,496
What'll I tell my wife?

246
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,330
Tell her you love her.

247
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,807
That'll hold her for a couple of weeks.

248
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,783
It's fun-time, Jimmy boy.

249
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,681
I'll give him a party. You make the drinks.

250
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,053
Hello. Jimmy Foster here. Are you there?

251
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:57,760
How can you do this to me?
You, I relied on. I had confidence in you.

252
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,334
From the other one, I knew what to expect.

253
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,236
He's hopeless, hopeless, hopeless.

254
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,935
Undisciplined.
That's why I sent you with him.

255
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,675
Hello, Spyros. How are you?

256
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,938
Get away from that phone.
I won't talk to you!

257
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,779
I won't, I won't!

258
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,854
All you know is to give me
heartache and aggravation.

259
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,612
Spyros, I got good news and bad.

260
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,622
Don't tell me the bad, bad news,
I got plenty of that.

261
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,286
Just tell me the good.

262
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,263
We're leaving Phoenix.

263
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,765
They're leaving Phoenix.

264
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:33,100
Danny, darling, that's wonderful.
Why didn't you tell me in the first place?

265
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,338
All right, tell me what's the bad news.

266
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,709
We're going to Salt Lake City.

267
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,838
They're going to Salt Lake City.

268
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,491
Well, say hello to your father, Timmy.

269
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,265
Hi.

270
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,136
Hello, sir.

271
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,606
Don't I get a kiss
or have you grown too old for that?

272
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,173
Sorry, sir.

273
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,549
Your clothes smell funny.

274
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,085
I came from a faraway place.

275
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,627
I know, sir. Japan.

276
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,390
That's right, Japan.

277
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:36,159
I didn't stop to change
because I was afraid of missing you.

278
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,796
Miss me, sir?

279
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,069
- Don't you go home on weekends?
- I do.

280
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:44,267
But Mother said you were coming
to see me and that I had to stay.

281
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:47,312
I'm sorry if I spoiled your weekend
with your mother.

282
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,207
But maybe you and I
can do something together.

283
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,983
Maybe we can go to a movie
and have some ice cream?

284
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,185
- Would you like to go to a football game?
- I would like that, sir.

285
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,988
Then I'll call for you next Saturday,
bright and early.

286
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,459
- Yes, sir.
- Right?

287
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,255
Dad!

288
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,067
You won't forget, Dad?

289
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,434
No, Timmy, I won't forget.

290
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,902
Merry Christmas, Dad. I made it myself.

291
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:18,941
Well.

292
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:31,750
Wait a minute.

293
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,154
Roger Corneal.

294
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,283
That's me.

295
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:38,520
First man in the 82nd to be fined
for fraternizing with the Fräuleins.

296
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,758
And the first man to greet me
on graduation day.

297
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,561
- How come?
- I saw Grace.

298
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,766
- Your kid glad to see you?
- Yeah. Look what he made me.

299
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:47,862
What's that, beads?

300
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,806
No, it's a Japanese abacus.
You can add and subtract on it.

301
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,173
That is clever.

302
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,579
Grace told him I was in Japan.

303
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,979
She couldn't very well tell the kid
where I really was.

304
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,346
No, I guess not.

305
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,113
How are things with you?

306
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,614
We need a master electrician.

307
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,816
- Who's "we"?
- Our old outfit.

308
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,619
You mean Jimmy Foster and...

309
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,787
Danny Ocean, Sam, Josh, all of them.

310
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,092
How did they all get together? What's up?

311
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,190
It's a reunion.

312
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,731
We have been getting things ready
for weeks.

313
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,606
Sounds like a whale of a party.

314
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,573
Bigger than Anzio or Remagen.

315
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,840
Only this time you won't get paid
in invasion money.

316
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:30,712
It'll be the real long green. Stacks of it.

317
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:31,805
Hold it.

318
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:36,287
Sounds like the kind of reunion
that can put me back into Calendar Hall.

319
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:38,454
No.

320
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,025
You don't get rich
if you don't take a chance.

321
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,462
Look, Rodge...

322
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,861
...the last joker who fed me that line
was a wholesale jeweler.

323
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:56,465
He wanted me to short-circuit
an alarm so he could rob his own store.

324
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,803
It worked out fine.

325
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,812
He got $60,000,
I got one to five and I lost my wife and kid.

326
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:06,315
The funny part of it is,
I thought I was doing it for her.

327
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,579
She always wanted a white fox stole.

328
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,284
This time, it'll take you one to five...

329
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,153
...just to count your loot.

330
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,158
No, sorry, Rodge.

331
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,852
I got things to do on the outside,
and I'm going to stay there.

332
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,297
Besides, if I went in on it,
you'd be licked before you started.

333
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,629
I'm hard luck.

334
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,097
I used to be unlucky only for myself.

335
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,172
Now I'm unlucky for everybody.

336
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:30,504
See you around.

337
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,705
Didn't you get medical attention
in the penitentiary?

338
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,804
Yes, sir.

339
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,449
Then what made you come to me?

340
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:42,519
When I was leaving, Dr. Griffin said
I ought to see a specialist right away.

341
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,555
He made the appointment for me.

342
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:51,821
Look, Doc.

343
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:54,927
Give it to me straight.

344
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,625
Is it the big casino?

345
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,671
I can't tell until I've seen the biopsy report.

346
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,101
Well, what if the report says it is?

347
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,532
How long?

348
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,040
Well, I...

349
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,141
How long, Doc?

350
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,066
What do you say, Tony?

351
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,126
You can still change your mind.

352
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,579
Will my cut be big enough
to send the kid through college?

353
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,944
Big enough to buy your kid a college.

354
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:06,727
Come on, Josh, your turn.

355
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:07,897
All right.

356
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,653
Vince!

357
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,248
Vincerinio!

358
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:05,915
How are you?

359
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,621
You are a tough guy to catch up with.

360
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:13,562
Trash is where you find it.
You've got to follow the fleet.

361
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,100
What happened to the ball playing?
No hit?

362
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,799
No see, remember?

363
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,506
You know, when I got out of the Army,
the only open club was down south.

364
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,303
No spot in the outfield.

365
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,768
Can you imagine how I would've made out?

366
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:29,211
A one-eyed third baseman in Mobile?

367
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,706
I always leveled with you, didn't l, Josh?

368
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:37,521
I'm stringing along with this operation,
but I'm scared.

369
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:41,582
It's no panic, there's just a little something
that gets me right up in here.

370
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,388
That's the only way to be.

371
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,528
Makes you careful.

372
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,198
Look, Vince,
the brave ones don't come home.

373
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,365
You stay scared.

374
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:54,971
You were one of those who didn't want
any brave ones on patrol with you.

375
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,302
That's simple enough.

376
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:59,935
In my book, bravery rhymes with stupid,
and it still does.

377
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,442
You were some yellowbelly.

378
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,811
Imagine the damn fool Army
giving you the DSM.

379
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,452
Don't think I wasn't scared
the day I won that.

380
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,488
Do me a favor, don't mention it now...

381
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,284
...because my knees start to shake
all over again.

382
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,494
How come this operation of Danny's
doesn't make you shake?

383
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:17,561
It does.

384
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,725
$1 million a piece.

385
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,464
I guess you figured the odds are right, huh?

386
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:27,333
Vince, baby boy,
the way I figure it is like this:

387
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:30,533
The eleven of us cats
against this one little city.

388
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,008
We're in overlay.

389
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,976
Okay, little pal, I'm ready for the briefing.

390
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,210
Well, step into my office.

391
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:08,571
Sam Harmon.

392
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,275
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Ocean.

393
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,417
What are you doing here?

394
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,713
You better stop getting prettier every day.

395
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,651
You'll turn into a monopoly.

396
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,158
I asked you a question. Why are you here?

397
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:25,390
I got scared I'd get stoop-shouldered
from all the leis hanging around my neck.

398
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:28,327
Same sweet talking Sam.
Danny still in bed?

399
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,629
- Not exactly.
- Is he in the hospital?

400
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:31,498
No, no.

401
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:35,801
Because some doctor called the place
I work and said Danny was very sick.

402
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,572
Frankly, that doctor was me.

403
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:41,542
In fact the message said he was dying.

404
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,204
I wanted to make sure you'd come over.

405
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,580
Dying was the touch that gave it away.

406
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,376
You knew it was a gag?

407
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:51,922
It's the sort of stunt Danny usually pulls
when he wants to see me.

408
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:54,617
Why did you come over
if you knew it was a gag?

409
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,386
Why, it's Christmas.

410
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,760
I have a present for him.
It's as simple as that.

411
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:03,033
Now what's your excuse?

412
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,065
I was wondering what it is.

413
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,661
I've come to the conclusion,
it must be love.

414
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,266
Mother-love.

415
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,866
I'll consider mistress, plaything...

416
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:16,274
...toy for a night, but I refuse
to be your mother. That's out.

417
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,838
No, you got it all wrong. I'm the mother.

418
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,542
I just don't like you and Danny busting up.

419
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,624
We're sort of eye to eye there.

420
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,693
I'd like to straighten him out.

421
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,088
No, Mother.

422
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,158
He's the only one who can do that.

423
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,429
What happened to your marriage, Bea?

424
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,466
It drowned in champagne.

425
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:45,373
I knew you both were up on cloud nine,
but I didn't think it got boring.

426
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,774
Boring, no.

427
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:51,407
I just woke up one morning and realized
there was nothing underneath us...

428
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,642
...but thin air.

429
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:57,351
So I got off at the next mountain,
walked down and got a job.

430
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,380
Danny didn't like that very well...

431
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,660
...and a little later I left him.

432
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,387
How did he feel about that?

433
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:11,595
He wants me back,
but not enough to give me what I want.

434
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:12,959
Such as?

435
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:18,671
A life that doesn't depend on the color
of a card or the length of a horse's nose.

436
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,670
Danny ran into a little bad luck, huh?

437
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,080
If only he had.

438
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:29,952
Bad luck might've made him realize
what things mean when you earn them.

439
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,017
We didn't have a home, Sam,
we had a floating crap game.

440
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,295
That's no life.
That's a way of running away from it.

441
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,323
- I better be going.
- Danny'll be here any minute.

442
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,301
I have a job to get back to.

443
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,472
I don't really want
to see him anyway, Sam.

444
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,370
There's just no point in it.

445
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,535
Danny's not the only one
that's running away.

446
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,204
Don't hack at me, Mother.

447
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,806
His luck is bound to run out
one of these days.

448
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:01,647
When it does, if he still wants me,
I'll be around.

449
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,320
- Hello, Danny.
- Bea, wait a minute.

450
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,517
Down, please.

451
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:11,252
What happened? I came in with a fellow.

452
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:14,662
A fickle fellow.
You stick with me, Lieutenant, I'm sincere.

453
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:19,470
- I got great news for you.
- Auburn beat Alabama by 12 points.

454
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,767
No, this is important. Honestly.

455
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:22,806
Hold it.

456
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,669
- Come on back upstairs for five minutes.
- No, Danny.

457
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:26,801
Down, please.

458
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,643
Up. All the way.

459
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,147
- The sky room's not open.
- Fine.

460
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,043
Why do I always give in?

461
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:36,046
Let's not start another round now.
I'm out of training.

462
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,645
It's a truce. Peace talk. So help me.

463
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,485
They always start that way.

464
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,703
Now just sit there and don't interrupt me.

465
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:58,302
I've got a very big deal going on.
Large chips. Carloads of them.

466
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,110
That sounds familiar.

467
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,644
That might be so, but this time it's true.

468
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,875
Good. I like to have rich friends.

469
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:08,576
This is one rich friend
who wants to spend a bundle on you.

470
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:09,812
Gee, thanks.

471
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:11,988
Okay, that's settled.

472
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,685
On the morning of January 2,
I'll pick you up and we'll hop down to Rio...

473
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,284
...so you pack a bag.

474
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,059
You're serious.

475
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:23,027
- I honestly think you're serious.
- Of course, I'm serious.

476
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,262
- A week's trip to Rio?
- Yes.

477
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,769
Danny, what a prize you are.

478
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:32,774
The only husband in the world
who'd proposition his own wife.

479
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:37,472
I married you once and it didn't work out,
so what's wrong with a little hey-hey?

480
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:38,378
Nothing.

481
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,380
Nothing at all.

482
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:44,354
I'd never knock it
as long as there was a little love involved.

483
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,146
You mean there isn't?

484
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,083
On your part, not much.

485
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,891
There's only one thing you love, Danny,
that's danger.

486
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:54,860
Cliff-hanging.

487
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,733
You could never love a woman
like you love danger.

488
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:02,698
And as long as your luck holds out,
you'll stay in love with danger.

489
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,803
As long as it keeps coming up heads.

490
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,404
Let's say you're right.
Let's say you're absolutely right.

491
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,778
But remember, I did not invent myself.

492
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:15,610
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means I don't own the patent.

493
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,312
I can't change it any more
than you can change yours.

494
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,482
Anyone who says he can is a liar.

495
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:23,922
I didn't expect you to be perfect
because I fell in love with you.

496
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,963
- Going down.
- Just a second.

497
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,900
It wouldn't have hurt you
to give me the same break.

498
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,995
I don't expect you to be perfect.

499
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,302
I want you to be my husband.

500
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,903
- Going down.
- Going down.

501
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,506
- Where they serve the drinks.
- To the bar.

502
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,194
James.

503
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,892
Hello there, Sam.

504
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,999
Don't stop, I'm just calling Mother.

505
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:27,984
- Hello.
- Mrs. Restes' residence.

506
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,289
- Is Mother there?
- Yes, Mr. Foster.

507
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,693
It's my Jimmy. My innocent.

508
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,924
Another innocent touch.

509
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,435
- Where have you been?
- Here and there.

510
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,664
It was wicked of you
not to have telephoned.

511
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,639
- We've been home three whole days.
- What do you mean "we"?

512
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:47,602
"We" means your poor lonely mother
and Mr. Santos.

513
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,612
I wrote you about him, I think.

514
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:52,744
He's been very kind to me
and he is a financial genius.

515
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,614
Just what I always hoped you'd be.

516
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,015
Yes, Mother. Speaking of finances...

517
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,623
...could you let me have some more?

518
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:02,355
Some more what?

519
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,290
Money. M-O-N-Y.

520
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,788
E.

521
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,627
Yeah, M-O-N-E-Y.

522
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,735
Yes, of course, darling.
If you tell me what you want it for.

523
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,838
I plan to paper the walls with it.

524
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:20,069
Dear, every time I try to take an interest
in your affairs, you snap my head off.

525
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:22,305
How do I know
what I'm going to spend it on?

526
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,371
It just goes, you know what I mean?

527
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,281
You mean spending money.
Why didn't you say so?

528
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,355
I was afraid you might be considering
some foolish investment.

529
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,254
- No, Mother, nothing foolish.
- All right, darling.

530
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:39,054
Hurry over and bring me a big kiss.
I want to see my big, tall boy.

531
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,532
Yes, Mother. I'll be there around 5:00.

532
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,368
What a way to make a living.

533
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:51,098
All right, Sam,
let's have a quick briefing on Hawaii.

534
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,105
Hawaii? Oh, great sunsets.

535
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:58,246
Only one a day, but they're working on it.

536
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,409
Weather good enough
to get me up in the daytime?

537
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,713
Sometimes it rains,
sometimes the sun's out.

538
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,481
How about the women?

539
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,346
Sometimes it rains,
sometimes the sun's out.

540
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,857
Speaking of women...

541
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:11,053
...did you take a good look at Bea?

542
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,995
Not really, no.
Play went around the other end.

543
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,926
She's still in love with Danny, you know.

544
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,502
Then what's the problem?
He's hooked, too.

545
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:22,069
Yeah, and I'm worried about him.

546
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,128
Worried?

547
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:27,136
Maybe you mean it's the project
that worries you.

548
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,701
Could be part of it.

549
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,607
You trying to salt the clouds...

550
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,309
...maybe spoil the picnic?

551
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,386
Jimmy...

552
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,789
...what do you need this picnic for?

553
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,984
If you want money,
all you have to do is yell for Mother.

554
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,153
You haven't met Mother, have you?

555
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,364
No, but I gather she's very generous.

556
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,999
Generous to a fault.
Especially when it comes to husbands.

557
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,166
She only had five.

558
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:00,936
That must've left you
pretty much out in the cold?

559
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:02,573
No such luck.

560
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,508
Would you mind spelling that out?

561
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,787
I had so much mother-love,
you'd have thought I was quintuplets.

562
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:16,418
She wouldn't let me out of her sight.
Everything was done for me.

563
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,323
After the war,
I tried to break away from her...

564
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,927
...but plenty of money
is a hard habit to kick.

565
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:27,163
That's why I'm going to our picnic.

566
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,771
Well, the Hawaiian hotshot.

567
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:32,740
Hi, Danny.

568
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,505
Hello, Sam. How are you?

569
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,603
Same as always: I move, I breathe.

570
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:39,479
I seem to feel the thrill of life
along the keel.

571
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,748
You sound like a ferryboat.

572
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,885
I'm not a ferryboat, I'm a very manly sloop.

573
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:47,480
Wherever I go,
people stare at me in dumb admiration.

574
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:49,024
What happens when they speak?

575
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:51,323
Never mind that.
Let's get back to how I was.

576
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:52,362
I was fine.

577
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,523
Will you get Spyros on the phone?

578
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:55,959
You know something?

579
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,900
The only reason I got into this caper
was to see you again.

580
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:02,029
Sounds like a hell of a price
and I agree with you: I'm worth it.

581
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,834
You're just in time for the jokes.

582
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:07,907
For you, Mr. Acebos. Very important.

583
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,012
Hello?

584
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,244
This is the Los Angeles County Morgue.

585
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,686
Los Angeles County Morgue? Yes?

586
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,388
We have a couple of men down here.

587
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,121
One is well-muscled,
and the other one is slender built.

588
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:25,723
Oh, my goodness.

589
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,594
These fellows were traveling fast
in an automobile...

590
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,361
...trying to keep an engagement.

591
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,458
Their names are...

592
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,433
Never mind their names. I know them.

593
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,135
I knew them.

594
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,134
Would you be willing to identify them?

595
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:45,179
I'm willing. I'll come down.
I'll be right there.

596
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:49,579
My goodness. Yes.
And what is your name, please?

597
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,783
Just ask for
Detective Lieutenant Brannigan.

598
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,365
Detective Lieutenant...

599
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,630
How did he get my name?

600
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,268
Let's saddle up. Let's go.

601
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,674
I finally caught up with you.

602
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,271
Where've you been for days and days?

603
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,374
What are you doing back with your wife?

604
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:24,682
I know she was in this hotel with you
not more than an hour ago.

605
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,148
You're two-timing me.

606
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:31,692
I'm warning you, Danny Ocean,
I'm one girl you can't treat this way.

607
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,128
I won't be pushed around and neglected.

608
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:37,063
What exactly do you plan to do about it?

609
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,928
Plenty. I'm going to do just plenty.

610
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:43,305
Don't you think it's about time
you got started?

611
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:44,807
Wait a minute, big buster.

612
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,969
No, you wait a minute
and listen to me very carefully, my dear.

613
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:52,646
I picked you up at the Baltimore Bar
because I had nothing better to do.

614
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,182
I made a pass at you
for the very same reasons.

615
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,084
I don't know your reasons,
but nobody twisted your arm...

616
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,680
...made you any promises.
So what is this act?

617
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,926
Not outraged virtue?

618
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,026
You really are a rat.

619
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,960
Why don't you let it go, Adele?

620
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:12,867
I know about the guys
you've had on a string. You told me.

621
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:15,030
Why do you treat me so?
I didn't do anything.

622
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,835
Neither did I.
So why don't we just say good-bye nicely?

623
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:22,242
Surely, and maybe I should say
thank you for being humiliated.

624
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:24,944
Well, put this in your pipe:

625
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:28,609
One of these days I'll break your back.

626
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,450
I swear it!

627
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,420
It's a good thing she doesn't pack a knife.

628
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,053
How do you know she doesn't?

629
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,097
To the morgue.

630
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,005
You low, miserable...

631
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:58,044
I cry, but not for you, or you, or you.

632
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,580
For my money, you could drop dead.

633
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:03,820
I think he's mad at us.
Let's go back to the hotel, driver.

634
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,355
You stay right here.

635
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:09,185
You, come out of that cab.

636
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,590
So I'm mad, I'm entitled.

637
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,260
Okay, Spyros, we accept your apology.

638
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,327
No phone calls.

639
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:25,974
With all these joke phone messages,
maybe you forgot to call everybody.

640
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,943
They should be here for the meeting.

641
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:30,913
Not at all, I wanted to check
to see if you were still alive.

642
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:31,970
Me alive?

643
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,449
Well, you know how it is.
You're so apoplectic.

644
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,816
My health is my greatest virtue.

645
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,611
Every day I do exercises.

646
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,657
Good. Everyone's going to be here at 9:00
for the meeting.

647
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:45,889
Then you can entertain us by doing
some deep-knee bends and some pushups.

648
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,225
- Good evening, sir.
- 'Evening.

649
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:51,359
- My mother at home?
- She's expecting you, but she's upstairs.

650
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:52,367
Thank you.

651
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,330
- You must be Jimmy.
- That's correct.

652
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,205
Your mama'll be down in a minute.
I'm Duke Santos.

653
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,377
I'll wait in here.

654
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,708
It must be a funny feeling
meeting a total stranger...

655
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,512
...who will be your stepfather.

656
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:10,883
I mean, I think it's only natural
if you resent me a little.

657
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:17,619
Then you won't mind
if I don't call you "Dad."

658
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:19,688
Duke's okay.

659
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,528
It's the engagement ring
I bought your mama.

660
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,695
That's nice.

661
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,738
Zircon, isn't it?

662
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,635
Zircon? That's a diamond!

663
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:31,799
I'm sorry.

664
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:35,306
You probably thought it was a zircon
because it's so big.

665
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,408
It isn't too big, is it?

666
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,379
Your mama's got wonderful taste.

667
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,439
Has she?

668
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:45,750
All right, rich boy.

669
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,950
You want it that way, you got it.

670
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,784
Let's see how fat you get tangling with me.

671
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:54,864
No, I know your record, Santos,
and your connections.

672
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,498
A lot of loot and a rough guy to cross.

673
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,995
But I still reserve the right to dislike you!

674
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,433
Sure, sure.

675
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,509
A man marries your mama,
like I said, it's natural.

676
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,068
It takes a little time.

677
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:12,014
But you'll find out
I can be a pretty good Joe.

678
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:13,515
I'll tell the FBI.

679
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,818
They're not looking for me anymore.
I'm clear now.

680
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:20,019
That's one point for Mother.

681
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:25,154
Easy for you to look down on people,
isn't it?

682
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,724
All this ever since you was a baby.

683
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,734
You ever make a buck yourself?

684
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:33,692
No, but I have plans.

685
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,964
Know what I had when I was a kid?

686
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,505
A lot of nothing.

687
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,438
Nobody to help me either.

688
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,145
Now I got a lot of everything.

689
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,777
Got a lot of years, too, and a sick stomach.

690
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:50,049
Proves that my way's better.

691
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:52,919
- What way?
- Choose rich parents.

692
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,094
You bet that's better.

693
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:04,256
My folks were so poor, I used to walk
New York barefoot winter and summer.

694
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:07,597
One day, I'm swimming in the East River.

695
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:10,538
When I come out,
I seen a row of shoes on the wharf.

696
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,097
One pair brand new.

697
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,438
I put them on, they fit.

698
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:17,540
Then some kid yells:
"Hey, them's my shoes! "

699
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:19,639
So we fight. I win.

700
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:23,617
It's been that way ever since.
Fight, fight, all the time.

701
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:26,281
- You always win?
- Sure, I got the guts!

702
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:29,256
Like you,
when you was in the 82nd Airborne.

703
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,759
Your mama told me.

704
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:32,862
You know...

705
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:36,900
...l've often wondered
if I'd had the guts to jump out of a plane.

706
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:40,730
No. Only for money.

707
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,339
Or if I was young.

708
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,569
You've got to be young to do anything.

709
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:51,007
Come on. Have a drink to my wedding.

710
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,070
Why not?

711
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:59,351
- Soda?
- What about you?

712
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,084
Not me. I told you. Delicate.

713
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:03,682
Come on, Mr. Santos. Fight, always fight.

714
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:06,996
- You got the guts, you lick them, you win.
- Yeah, but...

715
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,895
What's the matter? Run out of guts?

716
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:33,478
Darling!

717
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,616
- At last.
- Hello, Mother.

718
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:37,723
What's wrong with Duke?

719
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:40,661
A slight attack of courage.
We had a drink to your wedding.

720
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:43,495
- He knows he can't touch it.
- So he told me.

721
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,933
- It was naughty of me.
- Indeed it was.

722
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:48,164
And not congratulating me is naughty, too.

723
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:49,330
I'm sorry.

724
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:51,333
Bon voyage.

725
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,504
It must seem that I'm on
a marital merry-go-round...

726
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:58,105
...trying for all the brass rings,
but this time it's different.

727
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,809
You can say that again.

728
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,679
I realize that his background
is impossible, but...

729
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,552
...please don't judge him
from that point of view.

730
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,283
What point of view do you suggest,
Mother?

731
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:09,416
A woman's.

732
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,484
I find that highly impractical.

733
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,530
You could understand if you tried.

734
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:17,430
Since your father died, Duke Santos
is the only man who's ever needed me.

735
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,469
Really needed me, not my money.

736
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,561
All right, I won't be critical.

737
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:23,572
And now speaking of money...

738
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:27,169
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

739
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,142
A woman loves to be needed, Jimmy.

740
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,738
Duke is the most important thing
in my life now.

741
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:34,841
Outside of you, of course.
So please be nice.

742
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:38,445
When I get back, I'll butter him up,
tell him I'm sorry I needled him.

743
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,716
Where are you going?

744
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,987
I'm going skiing with Danny Ocean.
We're going up to Squaw Valley.

745
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,856
You won't miss the wedding?

746
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,494
Mother!
Have I ever missed one of your weddings?

747
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,327
Yes. The first one.

748
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,432
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye, darling.

749
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:05,277
It's after 9:00.
Everybody's here but this Jackson.

750
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,249
Shall we start the meeting without him?

751
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,351
Lack of organization, it's a poison!

752
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,584
It poisons enterprise,
kills it dead, dead, dead.

753
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:17,957
The whole point in having money...

754
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,552
...is so that other people know
that you got it.

755
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:24,964
I'll get me a big 50-foot Chris Craft
and not even put it in the water.

756
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:26,932
I'll just leave it in my driveway.

757
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:29,837
Give it to the mailman
or somebody like that.

758
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,875
That sounds real stupid.
Why not use it to improve yourself?

759
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:36,140
I don't need no improvement.
I'm all right the way I am.

760
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:37,936
Gin.

761
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:41,783
I can't understand that.
I played it like a god.

762
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:43,945
Finish the sentence. How many points?

763
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,511
I got 10 points.

764
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:48,986
Why don't you guys be smart,
and put your loot in with me?

765
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:53,052
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to produce my own pictures.

766
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:58,457
I've got to listen to all this.
They're rotting my brain.

767
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:02,004
So where is this Jackson?

768
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,900
Where is some sort of organization?

769
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,700
Don't panic, will you?

770
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:12,443
You know what's a good idea?

771
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:16,216
To take a couple of hundred big ones
and do something for world peace.

772
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,581
Like buying out the Miss Universe contest.

773
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,919
Get rid of all the parades and all that jazz.

774
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,516
Just sit around and talk to the girls,
one by one...

775
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,595
...find out how things are in Sweden.

776
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,727
Or invite them for a weekend
to New Orleans.

777
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,596
Ramos gin fizzes, oysters Rockefeller.

778
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,601
I don't like that goodwill approach.

779
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,736
Use your loot right...

780
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,566
...you can order them to New Orleans
for the weekend.

781
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:41,600
- Like to explain that, Professor?
- It's simple. By turning money into power.

782
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,405
Think I'll buy me some votes
and go into politics.

783
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:50,442
Now that's a good idea, big boy.
You'd make a good notary public.

784
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:54,020
He'd make a better coroner,
one of them laughing coroners.

785
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:57,788
- I'm the one that's going into politics.
- What'll be your platform, Big Sam?

786
00:49:57,894 --> 00:50:00,089
Repeal the 14th and 20th Amendment.

787
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:02,688
Take the vote away from the women,
make them slaves.

788
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,994
That's something that's real constructive.

789
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:06,831
Will it cost much?

790
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:10,737
No, we'd have the price controlled.
No inflation on slaves.

791
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:13,401
Vote for Sam Harmon.
Help stamp out mental health.

792
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,343
You got a better platform?

793
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:16,401
Sure.

794
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,038
Pay off your own party.
Settle for an appointment.

795
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,911
Now that's real deep thinking.

796
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:23,676
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet
our latest senator.

797
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:25,955
What a terrible thought.

798
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:29,390
Why don't you become an ambassador?
Be a big man in a foreign country.

799
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:32,451
Make that a little foreign country.
We don't want a big enemy.

800
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:35,095
Yeah. Little country like Andorra.

801
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,591
- Or Pomona.
- What about Little Rock?

802
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:39,491
Hey, fellows.

803
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,471
You have any idea how much money
a man can steal...

804
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,667
...if he was something like Commissioner
of Indian Affairs?

805
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:48,802
- I'll be Commissioner of Indian Affairs.
- That you'll never be.

806
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:49,641
Why not?

807
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:53,046
Because I'll be Secretary of the Interior
and I won't appoint you.

808
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:54,481
That's a snobbish idea.

809
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,051
- Won't you?
- No, I won't.

810
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:59,885
Certitude, my dear fellow,
went out with equestrian statuary.

811
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:02,557
Now what kind of language is that?

812
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,116
Beats the hell out of me.

813
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,094
I don't know, but if you ask me,
that cat's a spy there.

814
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,670
So where is this horse wrangler? 9:30.

815
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:19,208
Still running around Salt Lake City, I'll bet,
saying good-bye to all his wives.

816
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:20,709
And his horses.

817
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,614
Up and down, up and down.
And the houseboy's night off yet.

818
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,497
- Mr. Acebos?
- Who's asking?

819
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,875
He is. Do you know him?

820
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,507
Jackson. Louis, my boy!

821
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:59,447
What's wrong, Officer?
Louis, you did something?

822
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:03,041
No, he didn't do anything. We wanted
to be sure he got to the right place.

823
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:06,816
That's the Beverly Hills police for you.
The best in America.

824
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:09,223
They protect us night and day.

825
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,419
Thank you, Officer. Thank you.

826
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,023
Good night.

827
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,427
You're crippled.

828
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:16,863
Oh, no, sir. That's the way we found him.

829
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,964
- Good night.
- Good night.

830
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,428
Louis, my boy, come in.

831
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,511
I couldn't be in error?

832
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:33,980
I couldn't be in error, could I?

833
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:37,016
Your name couldn't be otherwise
than Jackson?

834
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:40,483
Nope, I reckon that's my name, partner.

835
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:45,784
Don't please tell me why you had to come
in such a pitiable condition. Don't!

836
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,555
Suits me, Mr. Acebos.

837
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:51,192
- Hello, Danny.
- Hello, cowboy.

838
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:53,429
What took you so long?
You come on horseback?

839
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:56,836
Hot damn, what a foxhole.
How do, you all?

840
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,065
Hello, Josh.

841
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,042
- Hello, Lou. How are you?
- Good. Great.

842
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:02,042
Hi, Sam.

843
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:06,148
So what's so funny for you, Ocean?
You should be ashamed of yourself.

844
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:09,185
Enticing a broken-armed man
into a project of such precision.

845
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:12,016
You know what your problem is?
You underestimate people.

846
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:13,487
Louis, grab it.

847
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:17,018
What's with the broken arm?

848
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:20,858
Why, shucks, Mr. Acebos.
It's all healed now.

849
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:29,969
You knew this, you Dracula.
You want to worry me into an early grave.

850
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,401
Lieutenant, brief your group.

851
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,535
Anyone who isn't at ease get that way.

852
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:41,375
Some of you already have a general idea
of the plan of this operation.

853
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,385
Before we give you the full picture,
I want to point out...

854
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:46,979
...that everyone turned up.

855
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,423
Not one goof-off.

856
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,985
I'd say this is a hell of a good sign.

857
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:57,032
Lieutenant, I think you and the Sergeant
ought to feel pretty proud of yourselves.

858
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,164
Now you've given us the good news,
how about the bad news?

859
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,098
Sergeant Ocean.

860
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:18,009
This is our objective. Las Vegas, Nevada.

861
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:20,478
Mission?

862
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:23,149
To liberate millions of dollars.

863
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:28,320
Now these are the five casinos we hit:

864
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:32,259
Sahara, Riviera, Desert Inn,
the Sands and the Flamingo.

865
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:34,628
H-hour is New Year's Eve.

866
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,129
Units involved:

867
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:40,337
Special combat teams made up
of former members of the 82nd Airborne.

868
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:45,246
Just for curiosity, how did you figure
this was a job for old paratroopers?

869
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:47,681
Why didn't you just get
some regular heist guys?

870
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:49,719
For the best of reasons, Mr. Harmon.

871
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,485
A man with a criminal record
can't get near Las Vegas...

872
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:55,023
...much less the casinos.

873
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:58,392
- I guess that lets me out.
- Don't be ridiculous.

874
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,225
You're no hoodlum.
You've no connection with the underworld.

875
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,561
Hoods are always mixed up
with other hoods.

876
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,999
Where there are hoods,
there are stool pigeons.

877
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,195
But with us...

878
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:09,235
...no stoolies, no leaks.

879
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,709
You five guys working in the hotels,
which hotels are you in?

880
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:14,641
Flamingo.

881
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:15,642
The Sands.

882
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:17,111
- Desert Inn.
- Riviera.

883
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,078
Sahara.

884
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:22,284
There'll be five more men working
as floaters inside, as two-men teams.

885
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:24,143
You've been to Vegas many times.

886
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,781
Give me a rundown on the exact action
that takes place on New Year's Eve.

887
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:31,387
Come midnight, they go nuts.
Everybody kisses anybody.

888
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:35,521
Then, because they've just met, they sing,
"Should old acquaintance be forgot."

889
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:38,333
How long do you figure it takes
to sing that song?

890
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,068
I don't know. About...

891
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,037
One minute and 38 seconds.
Exactly. We timed it.

892
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:48,808
One minute and 38 seconds after midnight,
we black out the whole town...

893
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:51,142
...and hit the five casinos at the same time.

894
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:54,946
Sahara, Riviera, Desert Inn...

895
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:57,252
...the Sands and the Flamingo.

896
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,117
Nobody will even see us.

897
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:02,881
You got a question, Tony?

898
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:05,557
How do you figure to black out
a whole town?

899
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:07,256
Let me ask you:

900
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,832
What happens if you knock out
one of these towers?

901
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:12,732
You get a short-circuit
when the cable touches the ground.

902
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,064
That's interesting.

903
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:16,630
Rheimer and Josh are the demolition men.

904
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:18,066
What's my job?

905
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:22,142
We need you to open the doors
to the cashiers' cages, where the loot is.

906
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,373
Those doors are controlled electrically.

907
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,539
The cashier can open them
by pushing a button from the inside.

908
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:30,878
If the button's on the inside,
I can't push it from the outside.

909
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:34,253
But that's exactly where
you're going to push it from. The outside.

910
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,650
Every casino's got an auxiliary motor...

911
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,456
...generating power
to light up the gambling tables...

912
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,497
...and the cashiers' cages
whenever the main cable fails...

913
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,533
...which happens quite often.

914
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,762
The auxiliary motor kicks in automatically.

915
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:48,997
Twenty seconds
and they're back in business.

916
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:52,473
Except they won't quite be
back in business on account of you, Tony.

917
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:54,637
Let me ask you a question:

918
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:57,804
What happens if you cross the wires
that operate the lights...

919
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:00,577
...with the wires that open the cage doors?

920
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:02,913
When the auxiliary motor kicks in...

921
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:05,177
...instead of the lights going on...

922
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,284
...the doors of the cages will click open.

923
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:10,416
It's as simple as that.

924
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,016
Yes, in theory.

925
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:15,291
But to be sure, I have to study
the main switch box in each casino.

926
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:17,457
But you will, you will.

927
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:22,303
Is this the only road in or out of Vegas?

928
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,439
Yeah, that's Route 91. Why?

929
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:27,407
I remember reading
about this guy in Perth...

930
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,637
Is this another one of your long stories?

931
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:34,043
...who cut up his grandmother.
- Cut up his grandmother?

932
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,481
Come on, let him talk.

933
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:38,612
Who cut up his grandmother
and mailed her out of town.

934
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,854
Everything went fine
till he ran out of stamps.

935
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,425
Which proves something crucial, right?

936
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:46,927
Wait a minute, Vince.
Pete's got a very good point.

937
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:51,228
Getting your mitts on dough is one thing,
but getting it out of town, that's another.

938
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,825
That's where Josh comes in.

939
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,093
- I was wondering.
- Don't wonder.

940
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:58,400
He's the main cog. If he goofs, it's over.

941
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:00,401
What's wrinkling you, Curly?

942
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:03,871
How long can we depend on it
staying dark?

943
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,579
Ten, fifteen minutes.

944
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:06,943
That's not much time.

945
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:09,507
That's enough if everyone does
what he has to do.

946
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:11,676
Danny's right.

947
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:15,451
You should all move like clockwork.
Seventeen jewel.

948
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:19,051
Boys, you should think of this...

949
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,653
...as a full-fledged battle.

950
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:25,266
Leap into it and with the same
high-type hearts...

951
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,429
...that carried you across the Rhine River...

952
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:31,703
...and other historical places.

953
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:34,870
Just think how proud...

954
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:38,778
...all the big brass in the Pentagon
would be, could they but know...

955
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:43,410
...that their labors made
all this beautiful operation possible.

956
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:47,386
You know, they should all sit right down
in the officers' mess...

957
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:50,085
...and have a good cry from happiness.

958
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:54,955
Even I myself am a little bit tempted.

959
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:57,865
Any further questions?

960
00:58:58,001 --> 00:58:58,968
Yeah.

961
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:00,861
What's your job, Acebos?

962
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:04,363
Mr. Acebos, what you all going to do?

963
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,505
Our modest friend here is a known felon.

964
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:10,574
They'd take one look at him up in Vegas
and we're kaput.

965
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:11,846
That's it.

966
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:14,313
Any more questions? Comments?
Anybody worried?

967
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,146
I got a suggestion.

968
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,619
- What is it, Sam?
- Forget it.

969
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:22,315
The whole deal. Forget the whole deal.

970
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,691
Believe me, I like to swing like you,
but you've got no plan here.

971
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:27,023
You got a pipe load.

972
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:30,293
Is this another of your morbid jokes...

973
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:31,991
...Danny, you sadist?

974
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,371
What's wrong with our story, Sam?

975
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:38,033
For one thing, 15 years.

976
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:42,143
This isn't a combat team,
it's an alumni meeting.

977
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:45,840
Any of you liars want to claim
that you're half the man you were in '45?

978
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:48,348
Can you run as fast, can you think as fast?

979
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,080
Can you mix it up as good as you used to?
I sure can't.

980
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:54,256
Danny, if you want to catch lightning
in a bottle, go ahead.

981
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:56,019
But don't try and catch yesterday.

982
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,390
Old times are only good
when you've had them.

983
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:00,191
Sam...

984
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:04,132
...some guys grow old
without turning chicken.

985
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,332
Did you hear about it?

986
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:09,466
Okay, Lieutenant Lionheart,
I grant you're brave.

987
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,733
But the question now is:
How dumb are you?

988
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:13,435
Only I know Las Vegas.

989
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:18,412
Why don't you believe me when I tell you
the percentage is always with the house?

990
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:20,949
The percentage is with the people
rigging the game.

991
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:25,919
- And in this case, it's us.
- You are a deserter under fire. A traitor!

992
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:27,547
Shut up or I'll step on you.

993
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,118
Why, you can't let him walk out like this.

994
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,658
He disrupts the entire plan!

995
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:35,124
Maybe you got an idea on how to stop him.

996
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:38,427
He owes you. You saved his life.

997
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:39,991
I'm trying to save his life!

998
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,398
Now, Sam.

999
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:43,765
Thank you, Danny.

1000
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,173
You don't owe me a thing, Sam.
And you're entitled to your opinion.

1001
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:48,642
Anybody agree with him?

1002
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:00,447
What about you, Josh? You got brains.

1003
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:04,582
Yeah, I got brains, Sam,
but I got to go with Danny.

1004
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:08,495
At least it only leaves us one man short.

1005
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:12,499
One man short. That's nothing, nothing.

1006
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:15,431
Danny, darling, just run a want ad.

1007
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:20,535
We have to leave out one of the casinos.
Which one should it be?

1008
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,942
Wait, hold it. Nobody's walking out.

1009
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:25,979
If I can't talk you guys out of it, I can't.

1010
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:29,984
But I'm certainly not going to let you
pull this job without your best man.

1011
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:33,881
So go ahead, let me have it.
When do we blow this mausoleum?

1012
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:38,622
Day after tomorrow, gentlemen...

1013
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,662
...we'll be in Las Vegas.

1014
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:51,934
Happy New Year.

1015
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:37,652
- Did you spray the stuff on your shoes yet?
- I did...

1016
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:41,178
...but the infrared paint you gave me
isn't ready for the public yet.

1017
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,817
- I can't see a single footprint.
- Of course you can.

1018
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:45,818
Try this.

1019
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:49,931
Still nothing.
Danny must be off his rocker!

1020
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:51,897
Cool it. Put these on.

1021
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:54,299
Go ahead, put them on.

1022
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,093
Now look.

1023
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:02,942
Wow!

1024
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:06,907
I got an extra can of this jazz
and I want you to do me a favor.

1025
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:08,974
Don't be stingy with it. Okay?

1026
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:10,710
- Hey.
- What?

1027
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,085
They ought to mix this
with dames's makeup.

1028
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:15,920
It would make for
some very interesting midnights.

1029
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:16,981
I'm hip.

1030
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,769
One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four.

1031
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:36,436
Three, two, three, four.

1032
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:37,877
Come on, kids.

1033
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:45,383
Up, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

1034
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:49,056
Kill it. Go on, Helen, get in there.
Take her place.

1035
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,615
You got a tough job.

1036
01:05:05,191 --> 01:05:06,488
Why so many barrels?

1037
01:05:06,726 --> 01:05:08,591
I don't know, some whole dinners.

1038
01:05:08,661 --> 01:05:11,152
When it's à la carte,
then we get sensible garbage.

1039
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:14,197
We'll have none of that.

1040
01:05:46,332 --> 01:05:47,299
Sorry.

1041
01:05:47,433 --> 01:05:49,025
- Hi.
- Hello, Mr. Skelton.

1042
01:05:49,268 --> 01:05:50,997
You remember me?

1043
01:05:51,337 --> 01:05:53,134
I remember what you told me, too.

1044
01:05:53,205 --> 01:05:55,639
What I told you
about putting a limit on myself?

1045
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,801
You didn't take that seriously, did you?

1046
01:05:57,877 --> 01:06:01,813
You said you'd break me like a dried twig
if I cashed another one of your checks.

1047
01:06:02,448 --> 01:06:04,575
Don't pay attention to that kind of talk.

1048
01:06:04,683 --> 01:06:06,207
This is all solid flab.

1049
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:09,219
I haven't got the strength
to pull the wings off a dead bee.

1050
01:06:09,288 --> 01:06:12,052
- Here. Cash the check.
- No use arguing, Mr. Skelton.

1051
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:14,289
We won't let you exceed your limit.

1052
01:06:14,727 --> 01:06:16,194
This is unbelievable.

1053
01:06:16,862 --> 01:06:20,593
Get a load of this guy. You'd think
we were going to stick up the joint.

1054
01:06:20,666 --> 01:06:23,999
We wouldn't do that, would we?
No. It's ridiculous. Cash the check.

1055
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:26,834
Please, this gentleman is waiting.

1056
01:06:27,373 --> 01:06:31,173
Like a tree, buddy boy,
I'm standing right here like a leafy elm...

1057
01:06:31,243 --> 01:06:33,507
...until you cash that perfectly good check.

1058
01:06:34,246 --> 01:06:36,214
You ought to be a little more careful.

1059
01:06:36,282 --> 01:06:38,512
I may hit a lucky streak
and win this casino.

1060
01:06:38,617 --> 01:06:40,642
The whole joint could be mine.

1061
01:06:40,753 --> 01:06:43,347
Then what little cashier's nose
would be out of joint?

1062
01:06:43,456 --> 01:06:44,753
- What's up?
- Hey, pal.

1063
01:06:44,824 --> 01:06:45,882
No guts?

1064
01:06:46,358 --> 01:06:49,020
Had to send for Wyatt Earp
and his little fat brother.

1065
01:06:49,095 --> 01:06:51,427
Watch the arm.
That's my slot machine arm.

1066
01:06:52,932 --> 01:06:54,524
Silver dollars, please.

1067
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:25,792
Coffee, please.

1068
01:07:26,132 --> 01:07:27,997
Could you light me up, please?

1069
01:09:38,797 --> 01:09:40,162
I had the key made.

1070
01:09:40,232 --> 01:09:42,427
Be careful with it. It cost me two bits.

1071
01:09:42,501 --> 01:09:45,766
I hope somebody's keeping an eye
on this reckless spending.

1072
01:09:46,105 --> 01:09:48,300
- Here. Here's one for the Sahara.
- Right.

1073
01:12:28,967 --> 01:12:31,629
You look like you're getting
combat fatigue, girls.

1074
01:12:31,703 --> 01:12:33,967
You been up on that line a long time.

1075
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:53,145
Everything all right, Joe?

1076
01:13:53,252 --> 01:13:54,981
Like tulips in July, Mac.

1077
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,101
- Come on, get a split.
- You can do it.

1078
01:14:17,609 --> 01:14:19,839
I can do it if you'll cool it just a second.

1079
01:14:19,912 --> 01:14:22,176
Be sure you let go of the ball, Harv.

1080
01:14:27,219 --> 01:14:28,948
What did you find out last night?

1081
01:14:29,555 --> 01:14:31,546
Casinos don't like to be robbed.

1082
01:14:32,024 --> 01:14:35,118
That's a pretty narrow-minded attitude.
The wire crossing work?

1083
01:14:35,193 --> 01:14:37,753
Technically, yes.
Technically, everything works.

1084
01:14:37,829 --> 01:14:39,797
How long will it take you to rig them?

1085
01:14:39,865 --> 01:14:42,060
Five casinos, 15 minutes each.

1086
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,100
That's 75 minutes.

1087
01:14:44,169 --> 01:14:47,661
Traveling time, 25 minutes.
That's an hour and 40 minutes.

1088
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:51,134
That's when I'll rig them.
An hour and 40 minutes before we hit.

1089
01:14:51,209 --> 01:14:55,543
- Can't you preset them so it's ready to go?
- No, can't take the chance.

1090
01:14:56,214 --> 01:14:59,342
If the main cable fails legitimately
those doors'd spring open...

1091
01:14:59,451 --> 01:15:01,112
...like a set of false teeth.

1092
01:15:02,187 --> 01:15:04,178
- Did you pick out a tower?
- The biggest.

1093
01:15:04,289 --> 01:15:05,984
Josh'll give you a hand.

1094
01:15:07,993 --> 01:15:09,358
What about the Sahara?

1095
01:15:10,095 --> 01:15:12,962
There's one security cop
that's really got me bugged.

1096
01:15:13,031 --> 01:15:16,125
He sits in front of the cages,
must have arthritis or something.

1097
01:15:16,201 --> 01:15:19,762
- The son of a gun, he never moves.
- A left hook'll keep him that way.

1098
01:15:20,872 --> 01:15:23,500
- Sam?
- As steady as down-country loving.

1099
01:15:23,575 --> 01:15:24,837
Good boy.

1100
01:15:26,078 --> 01:15:27,841
Louis, what about the Desert Inn?

1101
01:15:27,913 --> 01:15:30,814
It'll be just as easy
as riding a stuffed horse.

1102
01:15:31,516 --> 01:15:33,347
- How's that?
- It'll be just as easy...

1103
01:15:33,452 --> 01:15:34,783
Just forget it.

1104
01:15:36,254 --> 01:15:38,154
- Jimmy?
- Flamingo is all set.

1105
01:15:39,524 --> 01:15:40,889
What about the Sands?

1106
01:15:42,661 --> 01:15:44,026
Smooth and level.

1107
01:15:46,365 --> 01:15:49,232
Nobody carries identification
until the job's done.

1108
01:15:49,835 --> 01:15:52,065
Whoever's got an inside job,
go back to work.

1109
01:15:52,137 --> 01:15:54,662
The rest will wait outside,
mingle with the crowd...

1110
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:58,232
...stand in front of your respective casinos
till Jimmy and I contact you.

1111
01:15:58,310 --> 01:16:02,246
What are we going to do till we hit?
We have all today and tomorrow.

1112
01:16:02,748 --> 01:16:05,444
I got an idea. A therapeutic idea.

1113
01:16:05,584 --> 01:16:07,484
Forget it. No, no.

1114
01:16:07,552 --> 01:16:11,454
Today, tonight and tomorrow we rehearse
and keep rehearsing until H-hour.

1115
01:16:12,324 --> 01:16:13,313
Transportation?

1116
01:16:13,425 --> 01:16:15,256
Have no fear, little Josh is here.

1117
01:16:15,927 --> 01:16:18,555
- Let's go. Mushy's up.
- Come on. Come with me.

1118
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:20,928
- I never bowled in my life.
- Fake it.

1119
01:16:33,045 --> 01:16:34,603
Do we have time for another show?

1120
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:37,478
- It's late, isn't it?
- What about the lounge at the Sands?

1121
01:16:37,549 --> 01:16:39,608
- A good idea.
- That's my lucky spot.

1122
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,465
Someone you know?

1123
01:16:56,802 --> 01:16:59,930
I just thought I recognized somebody
I know from the profession.

1124
01:17:00,005 --> 01:17:01,836
Yours or his? Come on.

1125
01:17:28,433 --> 01:17:30,458
Well, well, well.

1126
01:17:31,837 --> 01:17:33,236
What are you doing here?

1127
01:17:33,305 --> 01:17:35,865
Same thing you are. Cheating.

1128
01:17:36,208 --> 01:17:38,972
No, you've got me wrong.
I'm here on business.

1129
01:17:39,044 --> 01:17:40,944
I expect my party any minute.

1130
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,970
I'd like to see her.

1131
01:17:43,348 --> 01:17:45,407
And I'll bet your wife would, too.

1132
01:17:46,585 --> 01:17:48,678
No, you don't understand. I'm all alone.

1133
01:17:49,087 --> 01:17:51,885
- Cross my heart.
- I hope you die.

1134
01:17:52,858 --> 01:17:56,419
Take your hands off me or I'll call that cop.

1135
01:17:56,928 --> 01:17:58,293
Let's not panic.

1136
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:11,705
When you realize how wrong you are...

1137
01:18:13,345 --> 01:18:14,334
...use that.

1138
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:33,160
Hello.

1139
01:18:33,231 --> 01:18:34,630
Mrs. Ocean?

1140
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,994
This is a friend.
I'm calling from Las Vegas.

1141
01:18:39,337 --> 01:18:43,467
I think you'd be interested to learn
that your husband...

1142
01:18:44,109 --> 01:18:46,942
...what your husband is up to
in this little town of Vegas.

1143
01:18:47,012 --> 01:18:48,377
That's funny.

1144
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:51,981
I was taught that creatures like you
always rattled before they struck.

1145
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:53,550
And I didn't hear a thing.

1146
01:18:53,618 --> 01:18:56,951
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Sorry I disturbed you.

1147
01:18:57,055 --> 01:18:59,615
No, malicious, I'm not disturbed.

1148
01:19:00,358 --> 01:19:03,327
When I learn Danny has an enemy
as venomous as you...

1149
01:19:03,962 --> 01:19:06,123
...it just makes me love him a little more.

1150
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:10,134
Call me any time,
love to have you waste your money.

1151
01:19:22,113 --> 01:19:24,013
Happy burial, dead dog.

1152
01:19:42,133 --> 01:19:43,691
Are you all ready, Pete?

1153
01:19:43,768 --> 01:19:45,030
Just a second.

1154
01:19:49,608 --> 01:19:52,736
- What time did you set it?
- One minute, 38 seconds past midnight.

1155
01:19:52,811 --> 01:19:54,540
- It's 6:05.
- Right.

1156
01:19:54,813 --> 01:19:59,841
One minute and 38 seconds past 12:00,
Big Daddy...

1157
01:19:59,951 --> 01:20:02,078
...and then: Happy New Year!

1158
01:20:03,121 --> 01:20:06,090
Happy New Year. Come on, let's go.

1159
01:21:04,783 --> 01:21:07,251
- Good evening, Mrs. Restes.
- Hello. How are you?

1160
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:09,446
- I'm wonderful.
- Happy New Year.

1161
01:21:09,554 --> 01:21:10,987
Thank you. Same to you.

1162
01:21:11,456 --> 01:21:15,290
Las Vegas is like Paris in a way.
You always run into people you know.

1163
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,952
And usually wish you hadn't.

1164
01:21:17,095 --> 01:21:18,756
My sentiments exactly.

1165
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:21,731
Excuse me a second, honey.
I want to go outside a minute.

1166
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,825
I adore running into old friends.

1167
01:21:24,035 --> 01:21:25,764
It's certainly our pleasure.

1168
01:21:25,837 --> 01:21:27,532
Is Jimmy joining us?

1169
01:21:27,605 --> 01:21:30,335
Poor Jimmy.
No, he's shivering in Squaw Valley.

1170
01:21:30,909 --> 01:21:32,171
But he's here.

1171
01:21:32,844 --> 01:21:34,436
Here? In Vegas?

1172
01:21:34,546 --> 01:21:37,447
Here at the Flamingo. I saw him last night.

1173
01:21:37,649 --> 01:21:40,345
Dear!
Don't tell me he broke something skiing.

1174
01:21:40,986 --> 01:21:42,385
Nothing that showed.

1175
01:21:42,454 --> 01:21:44,854
Why would he tell me
he was going to Squaw...

1176
01:21:45,724 --> 01:21:47,624
I'm stupid. It's simple.

1177
01:21:47,759 --> 01:21:50,785
He ran into some jiggly little number
who was Vegas bound.

1178
01:21:51,763 --> 01:21:55,699
"Jiggly little number" isn't exactly the way
I would describe Danny Ocean.

1179
01:21:57,268 --> 01:21:59,532
- He's more like a well-mannered shark.
- Is he?

1180
01:22:39,944 --> 01:22:41,969
$25 chips, please.

1181
01:24:07,799 --> 01:24:09,699
Tony! It's me, Steffans. Tony!

1182
01:24:11,803 --> 01:24:15,466
- Are you nuts? Get away from here.
- It's after 11:30. Think you'll make it?

1183
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:18,600
- You'll know soon enough.
- Okay, I'll see you at the blowoff.

1184
01:25:13,064 --> 01:25:16,158
I thought he said it was a lady's drink.

1185
01:25:16,234 --> 01:25:18,202
I think he meant a lady horse.

1186
01:25:18,803 --> 01:25:20,737
He meant one at a time, honey.

1187
01:25:20,972 --> 01:25:23,532
It's lucky I can hold my liquor.
It's very fortunate.

1188
01:25:23,641 --> 01:25:26,371
You can get to the room by yourself,
can't you, honey?

1189
01:25:26,444 --> 01:25:29,072
I got a date in the casino. Here's your key.

1190
01:25:29,314 --> 01:25:33,045
You're wasting your time with that Clyde,
honey. He's a loser.

1191
01:25:33,151 --> 01:25:34,516
He's a loser.

1192
01:25:41,859 --> 01:25:45,317
I'm so drunk, I don't think I could lie down
without holding on.

1193
01:25:58,243 --> 01:25:59,733
Get her out of here!

1194
01:26:04,649 --> 01:26:06,276
Here you are, missy.

1195
01:26:06,651 --> 01:26:08,141
Happy New Year to you!

1196
01:26:08,253 --> 01:26:11,780
It so happens that I do not know
who you are, my good fellow.

1197
01:26:11,889 --> 01:26:15,325
Now, who do I have to be
to wish you a Happy New Year?

1198
01:26:16,995 --> 01:26:18,223
Ricky Nelson.

1199
01:26:19,063 --> 01:26:22,032
I used to be Ricky Nelson.
I'm Perry Como now. Come on.

1200
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:24,000
No, you're not. You moved.

1201
01:26:24,669 --> 01:26:29,197
Smart girl. Now, about this night air.
Let's get in out of it. Come on.

1202
01:26:29,374 --> 01:26:30,864
Is it New Year yet?

1203
01:26:32,076 --> 01:26:34,977
- Too close for comfort. Come on.
- No. I hate it, too.

1204
01:26:35,313 --> 01:26:36,803
I hate holidays.

1205
01:26:37,015 --> 01:26:38,243
Do you like holidays?

1206
01:26:38,349 --> 01:26:41,785
- Give me a little kiss. How about it?
- Sound idea. It's constructive.

1207
01:26:41,853 --> 01:26:44,845
- Wait there and I'll come in a minute.
- I'll wait for you.

1208
01:26:58,303 --> 01:26:59,463
You know something?

1209
01:26:59,537 --> 01:27:02,563
I think I kiss better when I'm drunk
than I do when I'm sober.

1210
01:27:02,674 --> 01:27:04,039
Some other time.

1211
01:27:04,442 --> 01:27:05,636
Where are you going?

1212
01:27:06,044 --> 01:27:09,912
After all that we've meant to each other,
I must leave you.

1213
01:27:09,981 --> 01:27:11,915
Hey, now, this is a dirty deal.

1214
01:27:12,216 --> 01:27:13,581
Our first quarrel.

1215
01:27:14,018 --> 01:27:15,952
I don't fit into your picture?

1216
01:27:16,387 --> 01:27:18,412
From here on in you don't, sweetheart.

1217
01:27:19,157 --> 01:27:21,352
- Good night.
- Good night.

1218
01:27:23,461 --> 01:27:24,485
It's okay, man.

1219
01:27:25,496 --> 01:27:26,360
It's okay.

1220
01:27:26,431 --> 01:27:29,229
It so happens I'm very much in demand.

1221
01:27:32,036 --> 01:27:34,368
Maestro, if you please.

1222
01:27:34,706 --> 01:27:37,038
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's almost midnight.

1223
01:27:37,141 --> 01:27:39,166
So pucker up your lips, ladies.

1224
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:41,034
Twenty seconds to go.

1225
01:27:46,451 --> 01:27:49,443
Twenty, nineteen, eighteen...

1226
01:27:49,887 --> 01:27:50,945
Seventeen...

1227
01:27:51,055 --> 01:27:53,387
...sixteen, fifteen...

1228
01:27:53,658 --> 01:27:56,126
...fourteen, thirteen...

1229
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:58,751
Twelve, eleven...

1230
01:27:59,030 --> 01:28:01,555
...ten, nine...

1231
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:03,691
Eight, seven...

1232
01:28:03,835 --> 01:28:05,962
...six, five...

1233
01:28:06,204 --> 01:28:10,834
Four, three, two, one.

1234
01:28:10,942 --> 01:28:12,239
Happy New Year!

1235
01:29:12,036 --> 01:29:15,631
Lights! Lights! Darn that cable.

1236
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:17,971
It's the second time this month.

1237
01:29:18,042 --> 01:29:21,273
Stay where you are.
The lights will be back on any minute.

1238
01:29:21,345 --> 01:29:25,338
Once more, George, from the top and
keep playing until the lights come on.

1239
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:34,583
Pardon me. Wrong girl.

1240
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:54,277
Douse those lights.

1241
01:29:54,679 --> 01:29:56,874
Now sing loud and clear.

1242
01:30:04,455 --> 01:30:05,422
Sing louder.

1243
01:30:07,058 --> 01:30:08,525
With the music now.

1244
01:30:09,126 --> 01:30:11,117
When shouldn't it be forgot?

1245
01:30:15,366 --> 01:30:17,129
Blow out the candle. Blow.

1246
01:30:19,136 --> 01:30:20,603
- All right now, sing.
- What?

1247
01:30:20,671 --> 01:30:22,263
It's a party. Loud and clear.

1248
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:24,501
Do what he says, Charlie. Trick or treat?

1249
01:30:25,576 --> 01:30:27,476
You, too. Let's make it a duet.

1250
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:30,845
A little louder.

1251
01:33:07,872 --> 01:33:09,066
We've been hit.

1252
01:33:24,255 --> 01:33:25,847
- We've been tapped.
- What?

1253
01:33:26,157 --> 01:33:27,624
We've been held up. Robbed.

1254
01:33:30,027 --> 01:33:31,892
Get me the sheriff's office. Hurry.

1255
01:33:33,497 --> 01:33:35,021
- Hello.
- Sheriff Wimmer?

1256
01:33:35,099 --> 01:33:36,657
Sheriff Wimmer speaking.

1257
01:33:36,734 --> 01:33:39,168
- Flamingo's speaking. We've been tapped.
- What?

1258
01:33:39,236 --> 01:33:40,794
We'll be right over.

1259
01:33:42,473 --> 01:33:45,533
It's the Flamingo.
Roll cars 620, 622 and 624.

1260
01:33:45,609 --> 01:33:48,077
Roll some more.
They just knocked over the Sands.

1261
01:33:48,145 --> 01:33:49,806
Happy New Year.

1262
01:33:50,114 --> 01:33:51,342
How did it come off?

1263
01:33:51,482 --> 01:33:52,779
Like a charm.

1264
01:33:53,017 --> 01:33:54,575
Same here. Fantastic.

1265
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:59,285
Attention, all cars.
Cover all entrances and exits.

1266
01:33:59,356 --> 01:34:02,416
Sands, Sahara, Flamingo,
Desert Inn, and Riviera.

1267
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:04,384
Check everyone who leaves.

1268
01:34:06,163 --> 01:34:09,223
- Did you get a look at them? Any look?
- What? In the dark?

1269
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:12,201
I see, it was dark.
Did you hear anybody say anything?

1270
01:34:12,336 --> 01:34:13,963
Yeah. He said we should sing.

1271
01:34:14,038 --> 01:34:15,699
He said you should sing.

1272
01:34:18,209 --> 01:34:22,145
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Don Murphy
speaking for station KLAS-TV...

1273
01:34:22,213 --> 01:34:23,646
...in Las Vegas, Nevada.

1274
01:34:23,714 --> 01:34:26,182
We are in front of the famous Hotel Riviera.

1275
01:34:26,283 --> 01:34:28,478
In a few moments,
you'll hear some reports...

1276
01:34:28,586 --> 01:34:31,555
...of this fantastic robbery
from on-the-spot eyewitnesses.

1277
01:34:31,655 --> 01:34:33,589
You have something you wanted to say?

1278
01:34:35,159 --> 01:34:36,490
Do me a favor.

1279
01:34:36,727 --> 01:34:39,958
If you're going to interview people,
pick elderly couples.

1280
01:34:40,164 --> 01:34:42,530
Some of the others
don't always belong together.

1281
01:34:47,104 --> 01:34:49,299
Don't look now. It's little old me.

1282
01:34:49,373 --> 01:34:50,635
How'd your action go?

1283
01:34:50,708 --> 01:34:53,268
If it went any easier,
I'd have been ashamed.

1284
01:34:53,344 --> 01:34:55,005
Good boy. Get lost now.

1285
01:34:56,413 --> 01:35:00,509
Cars 305 and 309 reinforce roadblocks
extending to Barstow.

1286
01:35:00,618 --> 01:35:01,585
Acknowledge.

1287
01:35:01,652 --> 01:35:03,779
Get a rundown on every train
leaving Vegas.

1288
01:35:03,888 --> 01:35:06,152
Passenger and freight, east and west.

1289
01:35:16,901 --> 01:35:18,425
Things went too easy.

1290
01:35:20,404 --> 01:35:21,496
Tony!

1291
01:35:26,977 --> 01:35:29,810
Never the luck. Never the luck.

1292
01:35:43,894 --> 01:35:46,055
Okay, folks, get back. Okay.

1293
01:35:55,472 --> 01:35:57,099
Call for an ambulance, quick.

1294
01:35:57,508 --> 01:35:59,408
Okay, but this guy's dead.

1295
01:36:04,782 --> 01:36:08,149
Look, Danny, Tony's just another guy
who died in the street.

1296
01:36:08,452 --> 01:36:11,421
- A lot of guys die in the street.
- Sure they do.

1297
01:36:11,522 --> 01:36:13,251
It happens all the time.

1298
01:36:14,091 --> 01:36:15,058
No sweat.

1299
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:16,849
No sweat.

1300
01:36:18,162 --> 01:36:21,359
Yes, I heard you.
Check all outgoing flights.

1301
01:36:21,432 --> 01:36:23,559
Car 306, come in, please.

1302
01:36:23,834 --> 01:36:25,927
I want every piece of luggage examined.

1303
01:36:26,003 --> 01:36:28,665
306, proceed with plan 22. Over.

1304
01:36:28,839 --> 01:36:29,931
Ask them nicely.

1305
01:36:30,007 --> 01:36:32,407
If they don't cooperate, fine.
Let's find out why.

1306
01:36:32,476 --> 01:36:34,706
I haven't a man to spare.
I simply can't do it.

1307
01:36:34,778 --> 01:36:36,268
What do you mean you can't?

1308
01:36:36,814 --> 01:36:37,872
How did it go?

1309
01:36:37,948 --> 01:36:39,973
Smooth as a peeled egg. How about you?

1310
01:36:40,084 --> 01:36:43,019
Things happen that can break you up,
things you don't expect.

1311
01:36:43,087 --> 01:36:44,748
- Like what?
- Tony's dead.

1312
01:36:45,656 --> 01:36:46,452
Bergdorf?

1313
01:36:46,523 --> 01:36:49,151
Heart attack, I guess.
He dropped crossing the street.

1314
01:36:49,226 --> 01:36:51,023
The cops got to him before we did.

1315
01:36:51,095 --> 01:36:52,494
They'll check up on him.

1316
01:36:52,563 --> 01:36:55,191
Sure they will.
What are they going to find? Nothing.

1317
01:36:55,633 --> 01:36:56,964
Nobody will ever know.

1318
01:36:57,868 --> 01:36:58,994
No one but us.

1319
01:36:59,270 --> 01:37:01,500
Don't hit me on the head with that,
will you?

1320
01:37:01,839 --> 01:37:05,468
I'll tell the other men about Tony.
Maybe if I tell them, they won't panic.

1321
01:37:05,943 --> 01:37:07,376
The plan remains the same:

1322
01:37:07,444 --> 01:37:09,605
The money stays where it is
till the heat's off.

1323
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:11,580
Nobody checks out till we give the word.

1324
01:37:11,649 --> 01:37:14,379
You better go back to your job.
I'll contact you later.

1325
01:37:14,485 --> 01:37:15,452
Okay.

1326
01:37:17,821 --> 01:37:19,288
He's taking it hard.

1327
01:37:20,457 --> 01:37:22,925
Long time since he lost a man in combat.

1328
01:37:28,299 --> 01:37:30,597
Is it true somebody stole
millions of dollars?

1329
01:37:30,834 --> 01:37:33,530
Yes, ma'am, but there's still some left.

1330
01:37:33,604 --> 01:37:35,196
Would you move along, please?

1331
01:38:02,032 --> 01:38:06,025
The sheriff's office and the state police
have assured us we are going to have...

1332
01:38:06,103 --> 01:38:08,367
...a rundown and capture by morning.

1333
01:38:09,373 --> 01:38:10,897
Thank you very much, sir.

1334
01:38:11,642 --> 01:38:13,041
And there you have it.

1335
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:16,409
Millions of dollars are missing,
stolen by an unknown number of men.

1336
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:19,615
But, at this very minute,
they're being tracked down...

1337
01:38:19,683 --> 01:38:22,345
...as they skulk through the night,
down dark roads...

1338
01:38:22,453 --> 01:38:24,944
...where the long arm of the law
is reaching out...

1339
01:38:44,942 --> 01:38:47,376
- Happy New Year, Officer.
- Happy New Year. Say...

1340
01:38:47,444 --> 01:38:49,412
What's going on?
What's all the excitement?

1341
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:52,074
Will you get this garbage truck
on out of here?

1342
01:38:52,149 --> 01:38:54,117
I'll be glad to do that there.

1343
01:39:01,191 --> 01:39:02,715
Happy New Year!

1344
01:40:26,243 --> 01:40:28,711
Oh, my goodness!

1345
01:40:30,147 --> 01:40:31,444
Danny.

1346
01:40:39,990 --> 01:40:43,926
Before I tell you why I called this meeting,
I want to get one point straight.

1347
01:40:44,461 --> 01:40:46,861
We're not the sole owners of our casinos.

1348
01:40:46,930 --> 01:40:50,127
We all have partners we have to answer to.
Right?

1349
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:51,827
You can say that again.

1350
01:40:51,902 --> 01:40:53,893
Mine are coming after me with a rope.

1351
01:40:53,971 --> 01:40:55,836
Mine are not too happy either.

1352
01:40:55,906 --> 01:40:58,966
But they gave me a free hand
to make the best deal I can.

1353
01:40:59,042 --> 01:41:00,509
What deal? For what?

1354
01:41:01,578 --> 01:41:02,909
To get our money back.

1355
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:04,841
Now, how about it?

1356
01:41:05,349 --> 01:41:07,340
You boys empowered to make a deal?

1357
01:41:07,417 --> 01:41:09,385
- I am.
- I am, too.

1358
01:41:09,486 --> 01:41:10,145
Good.

1359
01:41:10,721 --> 01:41:12,689
Duke Santos is coming in to see us.

1360
01:41:13,257 --> 01:41:14,281
Duke Santos?

1361
01:41:14,892 --> 01:41:16,359
Just doesn't figure.

1362
01:41:16,827 --> 01:41:20,627
If Santos wanted to pull a robbery,
he'd have his lawyers do it.

1363
01:41:21,298 --> 01:41:22,595
I know the firm.

1364
01:41:25,302 --> 01:41:26,769
- Yes?
- Mr. Santos is here.

1365
01:41:26,837 --> 01:41:28,702
Send him in, please.

1366
01:41:29,706 --> 01:41:33,233
I don't know how you fellows feel about it,
but I'm glad he's interested.

1367
01:41:41,351 --> 01:41:44,946
- Mr. Santos, my name is Strager.
- Glad to meet you, Strager.

1368
01:41:45,122 --> 01:41:47,090
I want you to meet some of my friends.

1369
01:41:48,692 --> 01:41:50,626
Mr. Brice, Mr. Gillette.

1370
01:41:51,061 --> 01:41:52,790
Mr. Freeman. Mr. McCoy.

1371
01:41:53,163 --> 01:41:54,824
Won't you sit down?

1372
01:41:56,333 --> 01:41:59,894
We were just talking, saying how happy
we were to get your call.

1373
01:41:59,970 --> 01:42:01,335
It was our first ray of sunshine.

1374
01:42:01,471 --> 01:42:03,166
Don't worry, I'll get your money back.

1375
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:05,470
Hear that, fellows? Our troubles are over.

1376
01:42:05,542 --> 01:42:07,908
Mr. Santos doesn't make a promise
he can't keep.

1377
01:42:08,045 --> 01:42:09,410
- No doubt about it.
- Good deal.

1378
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:11,070
First time I relaxed today.

1379
01:42:11,615 --> 01:42:14,140
How much is it going to cost us,
Mr. Santos?

1380
01:42:15,185 --> 01:42:17,779
Let's say I wanted a third...

1381
01:42:18,622 --> 01:42:20,954
...and you fellows beat me down
to 30 percent.

1382
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:23,858
Okay?

1383
01:42:24,561 --> 01:42:26,859
And if he doesn't deliver, he gets nothing.

1384
01:42:27,798 --> 01:42:29,390
- Is that right?
- Naturally.

1385
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,763
I'll certainly go for that.

1386
01:42:31,835 --> 01:42:34,599
Our insurance won't even pay
20 percent of what we lost.

1387
01:42:35,339 --> 01:42:36,431
Neither will ours.

1388
01:42:36,506 --> 01:42:38,474
But that's a whale of a finder's fee.

1389
01:42:39,109 --> 01:42:42,340
I'd say that all depends
on what the finder's looking for.

1390
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:44,742
Okay, I'll go along.

1391
01:42:44,982 --> 01:42:46,540
- Me, too.
- So will I.

1392
01:42:47,851 --> 01:42:51,787
All right, but how about taking
some of it in chips, Mr. Santos?

1393
01:42:52,055 --> 01:42:54,023
We would like a chance to win it back.

1394
01:42:55,592 --> 01:42:56,559
Would you now?

1395
01:42:57,728 --> 01:42:59,559
Okay, you got it.

1396
01:43:02,666 --> 01:43:06,466
For 30 percent of what they took out
of your joint, call it: Heads or tails?

1397
01:43:09,606 --> 01:43:10,595
No.

1398
01:43:10,674 --> 01:43:13,768
No, thanks, Mr. Santos. I got partners.

1399
01:43:14,344 --> 01:43:17,404
They wouldn't want me to make a bet
without consulting them.

1400
01:43:17,681 --> 01:43:19,706
So if you can't put up, what do you do?

1401
01:43:20,083 --> 01:43:22,779
- Shut up. And that's what I'm doing.
- Good.

1402
01:43:24,488 --> 01:43:27,685
I'll expect the cooperation
of the local sheriff.

1403
01:43:28,225 --> 01:43:30,159
You'll arrange it for me?

1404
01:43:30,227 --> 01:43:31,353
Consider it done.

1405
01:43:31,428 --> 01:43:32,417
Mr. Santos.

1406
01:43:34,865 --> 01:43:36,355
May I ask you a question?

1407
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,592
If it's the right one.

1408
01:43:38,969 --> 01:43:42,132
We know you're not getting involved
in this because of the dough.

1409
01:43:42,205 --> 01:43:43,763
What's your real reason?

1410
01:43:44,741 --> 01:43:46,436
Well, frankly, I'll tell you.

1411
01:43:47,010 --> 01:43:50,605
Whoever pulled this job, they shouldn't
have done it while I was in town.

1412
01:43:51,281 --> 01:43:52,373
It's embarrassing.

1413
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:54,808
Call the sheriff for me?

1414
01:43:54,985 --> 01:43:56,509
It'll be taken care of, Duke.

1415
01:44:04,494 --> 01:44:05,961
The report on Bergdorf.

1416
01:44:06,029 --> 01:44:06,654
Who?

1417
01:44:06,730 --> 01:44:08,823
The dead man we brought in last night.

1418
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,991
The guy got a Silver Star, a Purple Heart.

1419
01:44:13,203 --> 01:44:15,103
Sheriff, Mr. Strager on three.

1420
01:44:17,808 --> 01:44:19,173
Yes, Mr. Strager?

1421
01:44:19,242 --> 01:44:21,176
We made a deal with Duke Santos to...

1422
01:44:21,244 --> 01:44:22,336
Duke Santos!

1423
01:44:22,412 --> 01:44:26,314
- We get our money back, or it's no deal.
- Good. I'm very pleased for all of you.

1424
01:44:26,416 --> 01:44:30,352
- He's at the Riviera. Talk to him.
- Sure. Of course I'll talk to him.

1425
01:44:33,023 --> 01:44:35,753
Locate the dead man's wife.
Tell her about her husband.

1426
01:44:35,826 --> 01:44:37,623
Pump her. She may know something.

1427
01:44:37,694 --> 01:44:40,390
I'll be over at the Riviera
with Mr. Duke Santos.

1428
01:44:40,464 --> 01:44:43,365
- Call me if you find out anything.
- Okay, skipper.

1429
01:44:54,711 --> 01:44:55,871
Come in.

1430
01:44:57,647 --> 01:44:58,409
Hello.

1431
01:44:58,482 --> 01:45:01,042
Of the names on your list,
Mr. Ritsik doesn't answer.

1432
01:45:01,151 --> 01:45:02,812
Joe Ritsik don't answer?

1433
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:06,382
Operator, honey, baby doll,
you're wasting my time.

1434
01:45:06,757 --> 01:45:09,385
I don't want to know about guys
that don't answer.

1435
01:45:09,459 --> 01:45:11,654
Try the Terra Haute call. Manny Ruditski.

1436
01:45:12,195 --> 01:45:13,924
Or Willy Henshaw in Detroit.

1437
01:45:14,765 --> 01:45:15,754
He's listed.

1438
01:45:16,299 --> 01:45:17,891
So's Fred Cusik in Palm Beach.

1439
01:45:17,968 --> 01:45:20,198
- Try them all.
- I'll do my best, Mr. Santos.

1440
01:45:20,303 --> 01:45:23,363
That's a girl. Now get me some numbers
that answer, will you?

1441
01:45:25,275 --> 01:45:27,072
Mr. Santos, I'm Sheriff Wimmer.

1442
01:45:27,144 --> 01:45:29,203
Nice of you to drop by so soon, Sheriff.

1443
01:45:29,279 --> 01:45:30,268
Sit down.

1444
01:45:30,981 --> 01:45:34,212
I guess you understand my position,
Mr. Santos.

1445
01:45:34,351 --> 01:45:36,376
We're all grateful for your cooperation.

1446
01:45:36,486 --> 01:45:38,954
But I want to warn you,
don't cut out on your own.

1447
01:45:39,022 --> 01:45:41,957
Whatever I get, goes straight to you.
I'm a great cooperator.

1448
01:45:42,025 --> 01:45:44,220
- What's new on your end?
- Not a clue.

1449
01:45:44,294 --> 01:45:47,422
We'd a net over the highway
three minutes after we got the alarm.

1450
01:45:47,497 --> 01:45:49,658
If that mob got out it was only by seconds.

1451
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:54,066
So they make it by seconds, it don't count?
They get disqualified?

1452
01:45:55,038 --> 01:45:57,063
It shows they're a professional outfit.

1453
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:59,734
- Is there any other kind?
- Now, look, Mr. Santos...

1454
01:45:59,976 --> 01:46:02,501
All right, Sheriff.
Don't get your feathers ruffled.

1455
01:46:02,612 --> 01:46:05,809
Mr. Strager says your sources
can check any outfit in the country.

1456
01:46:05,849 --> 01:46:07,840
You bet your boots they can.

1457
01:46:12,689 --> 01:46:14,213
- Hello.
- Duke, this is Manny.

1458
01:46:14,324 --> 01:46:17,953
- Yeah, Manny. What'd you hear?
- Nothing, not a thing. Not even a smell.

1459
01:46:18,028 --> 01:46:18,892
Nothing?

1460
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:21,019
Not a smell?

1461
01:46:22,432 --> 01:46:26,163
Now, what's this nothing dodge?
Keep nosing around till you do get a smell.

1462
01:46:32,976 --> 01:46:36,878
It takes time, you know how it is.
You've got to give it a little time.

1463
01:46:40,016 --> 01:46:42,109
- Sheriff Wimmer, please.
- Just a second.

1464
01:46:42,519 --> 01:46:44,350
- It's for you, Sheriff.
- Thanks.

1465
01:46:45,155 --> 01:46:46,452
- Hello?
- This is Joe.

1466
01:46:46,823 --> 01:46:48,688
- I talked to Bergdorf's wife.
- Good.

1467
01:46:48,758 --> 01:46:51,022
- Does she know anything?
- She hasn't seen him.

1468
01:46:51,094 --> 01:46:53,790
She hasn't seen him,
not the whole time he was in prison?

1469
01:46:53,864 --> 01:46:54,831
That's right.

1470
01:46:54,898 --> 01:46:59,198
- She's coming to claim the body, isn't she?
- She wants to take it to San Francisco.

1471
01:46:59,269 --> 01:47:01,464
She can take it back to San Francisco.

1472
01:47:01,571 --> 01:47:04,665
Turn him over to Cohen's Mortuary.
They'll ship him out for her.

1473
01:47:04,708 --> 01:47:05,697
Good-bye.

1474
01:47:06,910 --> 01:47:08,002
What was that about?

1475
01:47:08,078 --> 01:47:10,911
An old guy dropped dead last night
in front of this hotel.

1476
01:47:11,047 --> 01:47:13,572
Quite a hero. Purple Heart, Silver Star.

1477
01:47:13,683 --> 01:47:15,617
Served with the 82nd Airborne.

1478
01:47:16,887 --> 01:47:18,616
Served with the 82nd Airborne?

1479
01:47:18,722 --> 01:47:21,122
Yeah. Served in San Quentin, too.

1480
01:47:21,358 --> 01:47:23,918
I must get back to the office.
So long, Mr. Santos.

1481
01:47:24,027 --> 01:47:25,392
Keep in touch.

1482
01:47:25,929 --> 01:47:27,829
And is it vice versa, Sheriff?

1483
01:47:28,265 --> 01:47:30,597
Now that we understand each other,
certainly.

1484
01:47:32,102 --> 01:47:34,366
So long, Sheriff. You'll hear from me.

1485
01:47:36,373 --> 01:47:38,466
- Hello?
- He's expected momentarily.

1486
01:47:38,542 --> 01:47:40,874
Never mind, Operator, I'll call him later.

1487
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:45,004
Don't make any more of them calls
for about an hour.

1488
01:47:54,624 --> 01:47:55,488
Mr. Cohen?

1489
01:47:56,092 --> 01:48:00,324
No, I'm Mr. Kelly.
Mr. Cohen is my associate. He's occupied.

1490
01:48:00,463 --> 01:48:02,488
May I be of some service to you?

1491
01:48:02,933 --> 01:48:05,231
The sheriff's office sent over a body?

1492
01:48:05,635 --> 01:48:07,728
Yes, a Mr. Bergdorf.

1493
01:48:07,904 --> 01:48:10,338
Must've been a fine looking fellow in life.

1494
01:48:12,242 --> 01:48:14,710
With the compliments of Mr. Jack Strager.

1495
01:48:14,778 --> 01:48:17,804
I'm helping him with the investigation
of last night's robbery.

1496
01:48:17,881 --> 01:48:19,314
A shocking thing.

1497
01:48:20,183 --> 01:48:22,777
If somebody shows an interest
in the late Bergdorf...

1498
01:48:22,886 --> 01:48:25,013
...Jack wants you to call me right away.

1499
01:48:25,121 --> 01:48:27,589
My name's Duke Santos.
I'm at the Riviera.

1500
01:48:27,724 --> 01:48:30,955
You can tell Mr. Strager
he can depend on us, Mr. Santos.

1501
01:48:31,027 --> 01:48:32,392
He said he could.

1502
01:48:33,897 --> 01:48:35,455
And, Mr. Kelly, please...

1503
01:48:35,765 --> 01:48:37,756
...not a word about this to anyone.

1504
01:48:39,202 --> 01:48:40,692
Not even to Mr. Cohen.

1505
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:47,569
But it can't be. A job this big is pulled
and nobody knows who did it?

1506
01:48:47,644 --> 01:48:50,340
Believe me, Duke,
we're digging, but so far nothing.

1507
01:48:50,413 --> 01:48:53,109
- Not a single break?
- Not a break, not a tip, nothing.

1508
01:48:53,216 --> 01:48:54,774
Okay, Fred, keep listening.

1509
01:49:00,890 --> 01:49:02,790
- Hi, honey.
- Hello, darling.

1510
01:49:03,727 --> 01:49:07,254
Excuse me a minute, sweetie,
but this is the first opportunity I've had.

1511
01:49:11,001 --> 01:49:13,697
Hello, Operator.
Get me the Flamingo, please.

1512
01:49:13,837 --> 01:49:17,534
I had a date with Adele, but she was late.
Poor Duke, you must be starved.

1513
01:49:17,674 --> 01:49:20,234
I got other problems.
I can't have lunch with you.

1514
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:23,677
- But I asked a few friends to join us.
- Great. You won't be lonesome.

1515
01:49:23,747 --> 01:49:26,341
Make it quick,
I got important calls coming through.

1516
01:49:26,416 --> 01:49:27,974
- All right.
- The Flamingo.

1517
01:49:28,084 --> 01:49:31,576
Hello, Flamingo? I'd like to speak
to Mr. James Foster, please.

1518
01:49:32,455 --> 01:49:33,581
Who did you say?

1519
01:49:33,690 --> 01:49:34,782
Didn't I tell you?

1520
01:49:34,891 --> 01:49:37,519
Jimmy's at the Flamingo.
He didn't go to Squaw Valley.

1521
01:49:37,594 --> 01:49:40,859
Operator, if his room doesn't answer,
please have him paged.

1522
01:49:41,431 --> 01:49:43,763
Wouldn't you think
he'd call his own mother?

1523
01:49:43,833 --> 01:49:45,425
He knows very well I'm here.

1524
01:49:45,568 --> 01:49:48,298
Wait till he hits the crap tables,
you'll hear from him.

1525
01:49:48,371 --> 01:49:51,397
The only time he gives me a thought
is when he needs something.

1526
01:49:51,474 --> 01:49:53,942
I wonder what he sees
in that vulgar Danny Ocean...

1527
01:49:54,010 --> 01:49:55,602
...and all those Army cronies.

1528
01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:57,874
They hold more meetings
than the American Legion.

1529
01:49:57,947 --> 01:50:00,381
- I'm paging him. Will you wait?
- Yes, I'll wait.

1530
01:50:00,650 --> 01:50:02,447
They're having a meeting here?

1531
01:50:02,552 --> 01:50:04,611
Then why'd he say
he was going to Squaw Valley?

1532
01:50:04,721 --> 01:50:08,020
I don't know. Adele told me he was here
and Ocean is with him...

1533
01:50:08,091 --> 01:50:10,559
...and heaven knows
how many other ex-Army pals.

1534
01:50:11,461 --> 01:50:13,827
Foster, Ocean and Bergdorf.

1535
01:50:14,864 --> 01:50:16,422
All 82nd Airborne.

1536
01:50:16,499 --> 01:50:18,433
I wonder what they're doing here.

1537
01:50:18,635 --> 01:50:21,468
Maybe it's the anniversary
of one of their commando raids.

1538
01:50:21,538 --> 01:50:22,971
The little scorpions.

1539
01:50:23,473 --> 01:50:25,566
Anyway, it's all very mysterious.

1540
01:50:26,576 --> 01:50:29,477
- What are you doing?
- Not any longer, it ain't mysterious.

1541
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:31,670
- Hello, Operator.
- Yes, sir.

1542
01:50:31,748 --> 01:50:33,739
Cancel all them calls I put in.

1543
01:50:33,817 --> 01:50:35,307
Yeah, cancel them all.

1544
01:50:39,823 --> 01:50:43,657
No wonder I couldn't find out nothing.
A work of art. A real work of art.

1545
01:50:43,727 --> 01:50:45,752
Darling, what are you so excited about?

1546
01:50:45,829 --> 01:50:47,820
- This, honey.
- The robbery?

1547
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:52,432
Don't tell me
you had anything to do with this?

1548
01:50:52,502 --> 01:50:56,268
No. Relax, sweetheart, I'm clean.
But I know who pulled that job.

1549
01:50:56,473 --> 01:50:57,701
- You do?
- Yes.

1550
01:50:57,774 --> 01:50:59,969
- Shouldn't you tell the police?
- No.

1551
01:51:01,044 --> 01:51:02,636
And you want to know why not?

1552
01:51:02,779 --> 01:51:04,610
Because I love you too much.

1553
01:51:05,348 --> 01:51:07,282
May I learn what's so amusing?

1554
01:51:08,418 --> 01:51:10,181
Your Jimmy. Your innocent.

1555
01:51:12,288 --> 01:51:14,552
I knew he had guts the minute I met him.

1556
01:51:14,624 --> 01:51:15,852
Please, Duke.

1557
01:51:15,925 --> 01:51:19,656
Sweetheart, this job was cooked up
by Jimmy and his soldier-boy pals.

1558
01:51:20,029 --> 01:51:23,396
That's ridiculous. Jimmy's always had
all the money he could spend.

1559
01:51:23,466 --> 01:51:25,127
Why would he rob anyone?

1560
01:51:25,201 --> 01:51:27,601
Hitler had Europe.
Why did he want Russia, too?

1561
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:31,663
You can't compare my Jimmy with
that monster. He actually fought Hitler.

1562
01:51:31,741 --> 01:51:33,936
He and his paratroopers overran Germany.

1563
01:51:34,344 --> 01:51:37,745
Last night, him and his paratroopers
overran a hunk of Las Vegas.

1564
01:51:39,182 --> 01:51:41,616
It's a real shame
that boy wasn't born poor.

1565
01:51:41,718 --> 01:51:43,447
What a career he could've had.

1566
01:51:43,553 --> 01:51:44,986
I believe you're serious.

1567
01:51:45,054 --> 01:51:48,546
That's right, they hijacked the town.
Jimmy and his little paratroopers.

1568
01:51:48,758 --> 01:51:49,816
This won't take long.

1569
01:51:50,226 --> 01:51:51,693
I'll see you at lunch.

1570
01:51:51,795 --> 01:51:52,989
Want some lunch?

1571
01:51:53,062 --> 01:51:55,360
No, you go on ahead.
I may not eat for weeks.

1572
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:03,606
Hello, Danny.

1573
01:52:04,908 --> 01:52:06,500
Nice rooms they got here.

1574
01:52:08,878 --> 01:52:10,675
I don't think I know your friend.

1575
01:52:10,747 --> 01:52:13,079
- You don't know me either.
- Sure I do.

1576
01:52:13,449 --> 01:52:15,041
I'm a pal of Jimmy Foster's.

1577
01:52:15,685 --> 01:52:17,846
I know some of your other buddies, too.

1578
01:52:18,388 --> 01:52:19,548
Like...

1579
01:52:20,256 --> 01:52:21,416
...Tony Bergdorf.

1580
01:52:22,592 --> 01:52:24,526
Poor Tony died, you know?

1581
01:52:24,961 --> 01:52:26,087
It's too bad.

1582
01:52:26,696 --> 01:52:28,823
His wife's coming over to claim his body.

1583
01:52:29,566 --> 01:52:32,091
Tony's going home in a pine box.

1584
01:52:34,404 --> 01:52:38,340
It was a beautiful job you boys pulled.
A real work of art.

1585
01:52:40,410 --> 01:52:41,502
Are you a cop?

1586
01:52:42,045 --> 01:52:44,070
Me? Duke Santos a cop?

1587
01:52:45,915 --> 01:52:47,780
I only wish I was in on it with you.

1588
01:52:48,518 --> 01:52:50,383
How I envy you your youth.

1589
01:52:51,588 --> 01:52:55,217
You're not going to get any younger
hanging around here. What do you want?

1590
01:52:55,291 --> 01:52:58,351
If you guys'd been pros,
I'd have put you out of business.

1591
01:52:58,661 --> 01:53:00,595
But new talent needs encouraging.

1592
01:53:01,664 --> 01:53:02,653
I want half.

1593
01:53:05,602 --> 01:53:06,830
Half of what?

1594
01:53:07,337 --> 01:53:09,066
You tell me. You got the money.

1595
01:53:11,407 --> 01:53:13,466
You're talking to a dead phone, Charlie.

1596
01:53:13,943 --> 01:53:17,037
Suit yourself.
There's a live one at the sheriff's office.

1597
01:53:17,113 --> 01:53:18,239
So, you are a cop?

1598
01:53:18,548 --> 01:53:19,537
No.

1599
01:53:19,782 --> 01:53:23,411
I made a deal with the casino owners
to get their money back for them.

1600
01:53:24,888 --> 01:53:26,879
Now you're ready to double-cross them?

1601
01:53:26,990 --> 01:53:29,481
They're only going to pay me 30 percent.

1602
01:53:30,260 --> 01:53:31,557
You'll give me 50.

1603
01:53:31,628 --> 01:53:35,064
- Playing both ends from the middle?
- Sure, I can't lose.

1604
01:53:35,798 --> 01:53:37,095
You've already lost.

1605
01:53:37,867 --> 01:53:39,994
The money's sent out of town. Long gone.

1606
01:53:40,069 --> 01:53:42,094
If you're here, the money's here.

1607
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:46,970
We can't make a deal with you.
Too many people involved.

1608
01:53:47,043 --> 01:53:48,237
So talk to them.

1609
01:53:52,148 --> 01:53:54,173
That's going to take a little time.

1610
01:53:55,919 --> 01:53:57,477
I'll give you till tomorrow.

1611
01:53:58,755 --> 01:54:00,723
I know you won't try anything cute.

1612
01:54:01,424 --> 01:54:04,587
50 percent of something
is better than 100 percent of nothing.

1613
01:54:04,961 --> 01:54:06,724
1:00 tomorrow. Here.

1614
01:54:08,097 --> 01:54:09,086
Bye-bye.

1615
01:54:12,402 --> 01:54:13,266
Hold it.

1616
01:54:17,473 --> 01:54:19,600
What's your relationship to Jimmy Foster?

1617
01:54:20,810 --> 01:54:22,402
I'm going to marry his mama.

1618
01:54:25,982 --> 01:54:26,971
Charming.

1619
01:54:27,083 --> 01:54:29,745
Jimmy sold us out.
Your best friend sold us out.

1620
01:54:33,022 --> 01:54:34,080
You believe that?

1621
01:54:34,190 --> 01:54:36,488
What do you want,
the facts tattooed on your nose?

1622
01:54:36,559 --> 01:54:40,086
I don't like Foster much,
but now we found out he's turned canary...

1623
01:54:40,163 --> 01:54:41,960
...you must stand up for the slob.

1624
01:54:42,031 --> 01:54:44,864
You always have to be different,
always on the opposite side.

1625
01:54:44,934 --> 01:54:46,401
You always jump to conclusions.

1626
01:54:46,469 --> 01:54:49,165
What do you think the boys will do
when they find out?

1627
01:54:49,238 --> 01:54:50,762
Let me ask you one question:

1628
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:53,502
- Does Jimmy know where the money is?
- You know he does.

1629
01:54:53,576 --> 01:54:57,672
Why doesn't he tell Santos about it,
go over, pick it up, and split it with him?

1630
01:55:01,951 --> 01:55:03,851
Go ahead. Right on the chin.

1631
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:05,485
Forget about it.

1632
01:55:05,922 --> 01:55:08,220
I've been making
a couple of mistakes myself.

1633
01:55:16,399 --> 01:55:19,527
Mother, what is it?
I came as quickly as I could. Are you ill?

1634
01:55:19,669 --> 01:55:22,365
You fool! You complete utter ass!

1635
01:55:22,438 --> 01:55:24,065
That's good. You're not ill.

1636
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:25,630
I could slap your face raw.

1637
01:55:25,708 --> 01:55:27,767
What is it, Mother's Day? Did I forget?

1638
01:55:27,844 --> 01:55:30,210
You dare to be sarcastic
after what you've done?

1639
01:55:30,713 --> 01:55:32,180
No, it's not Mother's Day.

1640
01:55:32,382 --> 01:55:34,509
How do you plan
to celebrate Mother's Day?

1641
01:55:34,617 --> 01:55:37,745
Perhaps you and your tin soldiers
will rob Fort Knox.

1642
01:55:37,854 --> 01:55:42,086
After stealing all the money in Las Vegas
that's the next logical step for a maniac.

1643
01:55:42,291 --> 01:55:43,883
- But how...
- Amazed, aren't you?

1644
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:47,327
You probably thought
you had committed the perfect crime.

1645
01:55:48,264 --> 01:55:50,198
You moron, I could die.

1646
01:55:50,366 --> 01:55:52,857
- Mother, who's been talking to you?
- Duke.

1647
01:55:52,935 --> 01:55:55,529
- He knows all about it.
- That's impossible!

1648
01:55:56,272 --> 01:55:58,604
I mean, why would you believe
what Santos says?

1649
01:55:58,674 --> 01:56:01,541
Because, my little amateur thief,
he's a professional.

1650
01:56:01,644 --> 01:56:04,306
- Look, Mother...
- Don't lie. Your face gives you away.

1651
01:56:04,347 --> 01:56:06,440
Even as a liar you're an amateur.

1652
01:56:06,916 --> 01:56:08,247
Where's Santos now?

1653
01:56:08,351 --> 01:56:11,787
He's gone to see your confederates
to take the money away from them.

1654
01:56:11,854 --> 01:56:14,118
Now he's going to get
mixed up in this, too.

1655
01:56:16,392 --> 01:56:18,383
How could you treat me this way?

1656
01:56:34,644 --> 01:56:36,635
I think now's a nice time to tell him.

1657
01:56:39,482 --> 01:56:40,779
I owe you an apology.

1658
01:56:41,451 --> 01:56:43,919
I thought for a minute
you blew the whistle on us.

1659
01:56:43,986 --> 01:56:46,546
But Clarence Darrow here,
he proved otherwise.

1660
01:56:48,891 --> 01:56:51,086
What do we do now that Santos knows?

1661
01:56:52,528 --> 01:56:56,464
I wish I knew. I just know we're in a bind
and we haven't got much time left.

1662
01:56:57,934 --> 01:56:59,128
I've got an idea.

1663
01:57:04,073 --> 01:57:05,062
Come on.

1664
01:57:05,141 --> 01:57:08,133
I'll paint you a picture on the way out.
Come on, Clarence.

1665
01:57:29,332 --> 01:57:30,458
What's so funny?

1666
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:33,432
I knew this color
would come in handy one day.

1667
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:36,594
- Josh.
- Yes?

1668
01:57:37,073 --> 01:57:39,541
- How do you get this stuff off?
- What I usually...

1669
01:58:50,246 --> 01:58:52,976
Hold it. You can count it
when you get to San Francisco.

1670
01:58:53,082 --> 01:58:55,983
It's for Tony's widow and his kid.
It's only $10,000, Danny.

1671
01:58:56,052 --> 01:58:58,714
Good boy, Josh.
I should've thought of that myself.

1672
01:59:48,371 --> 01:59:49,633
Operation Pine Box.

1673
01:59:50,273 --> 01:59:52,537
Danny, the widow just arrived.

1674
01:59:53,276 --> 01:59:56,211
I figure she'll ship the body
to San Francisco on the 11:40.

1675
01:59:56,279 --> 01:59:58,873
It's the only train today,
they got over an hour.

1676
01:59:59,448 --> 02:00:01,882
Okay, you stay with her.
We'll phone the others.

1677
02:00:05,454 --> 02:00:06,216
Operator.

1678
02:00:06,289 --> 02:00:09,588
Operator, get me Dudley 2-6-9-6-9.
Thank you.

1679
02:00:21,037 --> 02:00:22,299
Vince Massler.

1680
02:00:23,506 --> 02:00:25,974
Watch the 11:40. Tony may go out on it.

1681
02:00:27,843 --> 02:00:29,538
Mr. Santos will get his.

1682
02:00:33,683 --> 02:00:36,277
Sorry to keep you waiting, ma'am.
I'm Mr. Cohen.

1683
02:00:36,385 --> 02:00:37,443
How do you do?

1684
02:00:37,553 --> 02:00:41,011
I came to make arrangements to ship
my husband's body to San Francisco.

1685
02:00:41,123 --> 02:00:43,648
Yes. Mrs. Bergdorf, may I...

1686
02:00:44,293 --> 02:00:47,785
May I ask, Mrs. Bergdorf,
in my professional capacity...

1687
02:00:48,464 --> 02:00:50,796
...are you a woman of means?

1688
02:00:51,767 --> 02:00:52,529
No.

1689
02:00:53,836 --> 02:00:55,098
No, my husband...

1690
02:00:55,538 --> 02:00:58,234
My late husband left me $10,000.

1691
02:00:59,108 --> 02:01:00,598
I received it this morning.

1692
02:01:01,477 --> 02:01:05,072
But that's all I have and I'd like
to keep that for my son's education.

1693
02:01:05,147 --> 02:01:06,307
I understand.

1694
02:01:07,616 --> 02:01:10,210
If I may make a suggestion, Mrs. Bergdorf?

1695
02:01:10,486 --> 02:01:11,418
Of course.

1696
02:01:11,754 --> 02:01:16,088
The services in Las Vegas are no different
than the same rites in San Francisco.

1697
02:01:16,525 --> 02:01:18,356
Your late husband was a war hero...

1698
02:01:18,594 --> 02:01:21,154
...and we have a chapter
of the American Legion here.

1699
02:01:21,230 --> 02:01:24,063
The Legionnaires will be happy
to serve as pallbearers.

1700
02:01:25,501 --> 02:01:28,902
Why waste money
on needless transportation?

1701
02:01:30,139 --> 02:01:33,836
- I guess you're right, Mr. Cohen.
- Good.

1702
02:01:59,235 --> 02:02:00,725
- Danny?
- Yeah, Corneal.

1703
02:02:00,836 --> 02:02:03,737
Something's going on in there,
but I don't know just what.

1704
02:02:03,939 --> 02:02:05,566
The box hasn't left yet?

1705
02:02:05,641 --> 02:02:07,609
No, and I don't think it's going to.

1706
02:02:07,676 --> 02:02:08,665
Why not?

1707
02:02:08,978 --> 02:02:12,880
A bunch of Legionnaires just showed up.
They must be here to attend the services.

1708
02:02:13,315 --> 02:02:16,079
It looks like the widow
is going to plant Tony in Vegas.

1709
02:02:18,454 --> 02:02:21,423
Okay, you wait there.
I'll round up the boys. We'll be over.

1710
02:03:11,974 --> 02:03:13,134
Hello. Who is it?

1711
02:03:13,275 --> 02:03:15,243
Kelly, of Kelly & Cohen Morticians.

1712
02:03:15,311 --> 02:03:17,939
You asked me to call you
if something unusual happened...

1713
02:03:18,013 --> 02:03:20,140
...in regards to our client Mr. Bergdorf.

1714
02:03:20,816 --> 02:03:22,545
Bergdorf? Go ahead.

1715
02:03:22,651 --> 02:03:25,518
About a dozen men arrived
to attend the services...

1716
02:03:25,588 --> 02:03:28,056
...which are being held
in our beautiful chapel...

1717
02:03:28,324 --> 02:03:31,452
...which serves all denominations,
faiths and creeds.

1718
02:03:31,527 --> 02:03:33,358
Skip the commercial, will you?

1719
02:03:33,729 --> 02:03:36,323
These men don't look like
the usual mourners.

1720
02:03:37,199 --> 02:03:39,133
Mr. Santos, there's something else.

1721
02:03:39,201 --> 02:03:43,001
I made a discovery in the Waiting Chapel
that's most unusual.

1722
02:03:43,539 --> 02:03:45,336
I could call it incredible.

1723
02:03:46,008 --> 02:03:48,841
Mr. Santos, I will call it incredible.

1724
02:03:49,812 --> 02:03:51,780
- What is it?
- A money band.

1725
02:03:52,281 --> 02:03:54,613
A $10,000 money band.

1726
02:03:54,984 --> 02:03:58,545
It was lying by the coffin,
and it certainly wasn't there last night.

1727
02:03:59,655 --> 02:04:00,917
By the coffin?

1728
02:04:01,257 --> 02:04:02,519
Right beside it.

1729
02:04:02,591 --> 02:04:04,718
I hardly know what to think.

1730
02:04:05,628 --> 02:04:07,653
I do. I'll be right over.

1731
02:04:08,664 --> 02:04:12,065
How do you like that?
A dead delivery boy. Corny characters.

1732
02:04:13,269 --> 02:04:16,500
We are gathered together today
to pay honor and tribute...

1733
02:04:16,872 --> 02:04:19,807
...to the memory
of Anthony Raymond Bergdorf.

1734
02:04:20,910 --> 02:04:25,404
At such a time, it is altogether fitting
that we recall the Psalm of David.

1735
02:04:27,149 --> 02:04:30,141
"The Lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want...

1736
02:04:31,587 --> 02:04:34,488
"...he maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1737
02:04:35,291 --> 02:04:37,623
"He leadeth me beside still waters...

1738
02:04:38,394 --> 02:04:40,294
"...he restoreth my soul.

1739
02:04:41,564 --> 02:04:45,466
"He guideth me in the paths
of righteousness for his name's sake.

1740
02:04:47,102 --> 02:04:50,538
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

1741
02:04:51,106 --> 02:04:54,564
"...I will fear no evil for thou art with me...

1742
02:04:55,578 --> 02:04:57,842
"...thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

1743
02:04:59,448 --> 02:05:03,179
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies...

1744
02:05:04,386 --> 02:05:06,445
"...thou annointest my head with oil...

1745
02:05:07,022 --> 02:05:08,614
"...my cup runneth over.

1746
02:05:09,892 --> 02:05:13,157
"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days..."

1747
02:05:13,228 --> 02:05:14,820
What's that noise?

1748
02:05:15,230 --> 02:05:16,925
What's that noise?

1749
02:05:18,934 --> 02:05:20,731
What's that noise?

1750
02:05:22,671 --> 02:05:24,662
The deceased is being cremated.

1751
02:05:25,474 --> 02:05:29,706
"Verily, verily, the Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away.

1752
02:05:30,779 --> 02:05:33,907
"Earth to earth, ashes to ashes...

1753
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:36,110
"...dust to dust...

1754
02:05:37,653 --> 02:05:41,589
"...in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection unto eternal life.

1755
02:05:43,025 --> 02:05:47,223
"The Lord lift up his face upon you
and give you peace...

1756
02:05:47,863 --> 02:05:49,592
"...this day and always.

1757
02:05:50,666 --> 02:05:51,655
"Amen."
