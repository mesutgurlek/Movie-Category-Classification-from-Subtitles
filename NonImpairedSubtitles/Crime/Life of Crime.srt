         a basketball close in. 

109
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,948
               M1 Garand, Army, 
               World War II.    

110
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,116
  That's beautiful.             

111
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,184
         German standard issue. 

112
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,188

                standard issue. 

113
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,824
     US Army, World War II.     

114
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,626
         Lot of people          
         think this is a Luger. 

115
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,161
           This is not.         
           It's a Walther P38.  

116
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,631
                Your dad was in 
                the war, right? 

117
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,967
          Yeah, tank gunner.    

118
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,201
 Yeah, but...                   

119
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,240
          Which side was he on? 

120
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:31,943
 So, Richard, you're telling me 
 all these herbs come           
 from your own garden?          

121
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,912
     Yeah, from the fall.       
     They're dried now.         

122
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,081
 Um, really good.               

123
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,884
 You went and pee               
 in this, did you?              
 I just fucking with you.       

124
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:41,786
 I know you ain't peed.         
 I could tell if                
 you did, though.               

125
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:42,988
 What? What's the matter?       

126
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,791
 Oh, that. That ain't...        

127
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:50,195
 It's actually my favorite.     
 But, you know,                 
 Richard don't think...         

128
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,797
 Some niggas is all right,      
 ain't they? Right?             

129
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,600
             Some.              

130
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,103
 ORDELL: You like               
 that Diahann Carroll,          
 don't you?                     

131
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:01,873
  Don't get cute for            
  company. You talk             
  about her all the time.       

132
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,010
   But the rest of them,        
   and I tend to agree          
   with him on this one,        

133
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,978
   he said they need            
   to go back to Africa.        

134
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,246
 The ones on welfare.           

135
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,848
          Right. Of course      
          the ones on welfare.  

136
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,082
         You know,              
         they ain't doing shit. 

137
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,318
       They ain't               
       contributing to society. 

138
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,188
 He said I could stay, though.  
 At least until we              
 finish the job, you know.      

139
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,658
           We should get going. 

140
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,992
 Yeah, you don't...             
 You don't want nothing?        

141
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:21,993
    You don't want me           
    to follow her today?        

142
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,562
                        No.     

143
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,264
 No, no. No, that's fine.       
 We're good today.              

144
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,300
             We'll get in touch 
             with you, Richard. 

145
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:29,801
     He's incredible.           
     He's amazing.              

146
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,603
   Listen, all I got to         
   do was tell him,             

147
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:34,239
 "Hey, Richard,                 
 this a rich, big Jew."         

148
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,608
    And then it's like,         
    "This is for the cause."    

149
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,977
       Then he would do it      
       even if he didn't        
       need the money so bad.   

150
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:42,213
 What's he need money for?      
 Buy more guns?                 
 Hitler's underwear?            

151
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:45,717
            No.                 
            (CHUCKLES) His      
            old lady left him.  

152
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,186
         Ran off, took Richard  
         Junior and everything. 

153
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,654
      No kidding.               
                 Yeah.          

154
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,890
          Now he think that     
          they in California    

155
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:55,226
      'cause he got a           
      postcard from Disneyland. 

156
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,761
        Jesus.                  

157
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,196
            He so dumb,         
            it's adorable.      

158
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,374
 LOUIS: That's her?             
            ORDELL: That's her. 

159
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,375
               Hmm.             

160
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,945
 I was expecting someone older. 

161
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,148
                Oh, that's her. 

162
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,652
 That's the one we want.        
 That's Mickey.                 

163
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,754
           BO: Why'd they have  
           to choose us for     
           this stupid article? 

164
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,255
   Because you won that day.    

165
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,791
         It's mostly about you.

 focus on today's game?         

170
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,405
 You didn't wake me up.         

171
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:42,140
       I didn't know you        
       were playing today.      
       You didn't say anything.

00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,809
 I never play                   
 tennis on Sundays, huh?        
                     Well...    

173
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,645
 Why would I play               
 tennis on Sundays?             
                    I'm just...

 I do every Sunday?             

175
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,683

176

177
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,188
 Why do I have to wake up       
 to that neighbor's dog?

       name's in the paper.

00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,195
 For the Club Championship?     

181
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,430
 No, it's actually              
 about the kids.                

182
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,098
           You know, the        
           kids playing tennis? 

183
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,701
     Oh, oh, look at that!      
     It's the two of you there. 

184
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,236
                    Yeah.       

185
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,270
                 That's a nice  
                 picture of Bo. 

186
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,907
 You look stressed, honey.      

187
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,112
 Listen, since I'm,             
 uh, going down to Freeport     
 the end of the week...         

188
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,183
 I told you                     
 about that, right?             

189
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,118
          I don't know.         
          You might have.       

190
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,920
 Yeah, I'm sure I did.

         Can you believe it?    

193
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,827
 So, I figured,                 
 why not fly down               
 to South Beach.                

194
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,197
       Tonight.                 

195
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,167
    With Bo? See your folks.    

196
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,803
 Get him settled,               
 then I'll hop on               
 the shuttle to Freeport.       

197
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,305
         What do you think, Bo? 
         Sound like fun?        

198
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,144
  I just don't see why          
  all of a sudden he has to go. 

199
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:56,281
          How many times?       
          You don't say "he."   

200
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:59,150
 You know who I mean.           
           That's not the       
           point, all right?    

201
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,720
           He, your father,     
           will be in Freeport, 

202
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,955
              and he thought    
              it would be nice  

203
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:07,358
   for you guys to              
   fly down together            
   and spend some quality time.

            check out the camp. 

205
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,996
       You know, he loves       
       watching you. So...      

206
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,065
   He loves to tell me what     
   to do. He doesn't know shit. 

207
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,036
           Well, does he?

     so I'm late for that.      

261

 I hear Frank's                 
 off to the Bahamas.

           Just for a few days. 

263

 wanted to play next Saturday   

264
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,491
 and he said he'd be            
 gone the whole week.           

265
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,431
                   When...      

266
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,100
 Lunch tomorrow?                
 Scalintella, 1:00?             

267
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:05,036
             No, when did he... 

268
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,471
             This is really     
             not a good idea.   
 You're right.                  

269
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,406
                   Okay?

 personal bank account

756
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:19,876
 Hey.                           

757
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,145
 Face forward.                  

758
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:26,349
         I know he does         
         business down there.   
         I would assume that... 

759
00:46:26,351 --> 00:46:28,451

762
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:34,423
                Maybe that's... 

763
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:35,925
 It's 50 grand a month          

764
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:37,393
 he's been taking               
 out of his apartments          

765
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:39,529
 in Detroit and                 
 putting it away.               

766
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:50,139

      <i> cost me 100 grand.</i>       

767
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:53,476
 I put about 40                 
 grand worth of materials       
 and appliances in it           

768
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:55,411
 and have it                    
 reappraised for 200 grand.     

769
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:56,946
                  Wow.          

770
00:46:56,948 --> 00:47:00,149
 Okay. Now, I've only           
 put 10% down, right?           

771
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:02,051
   And the 40 grand of          
   materials actually only      

772
00:47:02,053 --> 00:47:03,820
   really cost me about         
   four or five grand.          

773
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:06,422

 depreciation on...             

774
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:09,058
             Two hundred grand. 
        Right.                  

775
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,461
 And on the rentals,            
 I only declare 60% occupancy.  

776
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:13,529
 And that's                     
 all paid in cash.              

777
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,164

         You're a genius, baby. 

779
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:22,205
 Somehow, though,               
 these guys that called,        
 they know about this.          

780
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,413

         besides the obvious,   

781
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:33,583
         is here you are

         and then this happens.

      to happen to her, either.

        the million bucks,      
        and they still might...

      that. You still might not 
      see her again, honey.     

787

     for some reason

           We're not gonna      
           get through to him.  

968
00:59:55,793 --> 00:59:57,893
 So we know they're up there,   
 but what are they saying?      

969
00:59:57,895 --> 01:00:01,263
      Checking our temperature, 
      that's what they doing.   

970
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:03,765
        Seeing if we serious.   

971
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,968
 We should go down there,       
 show him something.            

972
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:10,038
 Like his wife's fingers.       

973
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,974
 Just like maybe                
 the wedding ring finger.       

974
01:00:11,976 --> 01:00:14,009
 He already knows we got her.   

975
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:16,044
 No. No.                        

976
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:21,216
 We need to make                
 an impression.                 
 They think it's a game.        

977
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:24,219
                 Hey, he knows. 

978
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:26,888
      It's just a lot of money. 
      It's not a decision       
      you make in an hour.      

979
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:30,726
 It's been two days,            
 Louis, going on three.         

980
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,229
 Her time is up.                

981
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,933
            Hey.                

982
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:39,835
       Don't start no shit      
       you can't finish, Louis. 

983
01:00:39,837 --> 01:00:41,803
 You need to calm               
 down. You're not               
 thinking this through.         

984
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:45,273
           What you think we    
           doing here? We ain't 
           boosting no car.     

985
01:00:45,275 --> 01:00:49,077
 We took a woman.               
 Now what? You want             
 to be nice?                    

986
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:50,946
 Oh, you got some               
 other shit on your mind.       

987
01:00:50,948 --> 01:00:52,981
 LOUIS: Fuck you.               
 Fuck you!                      

988
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:54,683
          It ain't about what   
          you feel. It's about  
          what you're gonna do. 

989
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:56,351
      How you handle yourself   
      in a situation like this. 

990
01:00:56,353 --> 01:00:57,886
             The man want to    
             take his time, and 

991
01:00:57,888 --> 01:00:59,187
           the woman wanna hang 
           up the phone on us.  

992
01:00:59,189 --> 01:01:00,856
                The fuck we     
                supposed to do? 
                Come on, man.   

993
01:01:00,858 --> 01:01:02,891
       Stop touching me!        

994
01:01:02,893 --> 01:01:05,894
     Either he cares            
     what happens to her,       
     or he doesn't give a shit! 

995
01:01:05,896 --> 01:01:08,096
             Finger isn't       
             gonna do anything! 

996
01:01:08,098 --> 01:01:11,667
    LOUIS: He gives us          
    the finger, tells us to     
    shove it up our ass!        

997
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:14,069
 I'm not disagreeing with you.  

998
01:01:14,071 --> 01:01:17,105
                  You're right. 

999
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:21,443
              We need to find   
              a way to put him  
              against the wall. 

1000
01:01:21,445 --> 01:01:24,680
 So, we go down                 
 there and leave                
 Richard here with her?         

1001
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:29,117
                 I thought      
                 about it, too. 

1002
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:30,986
     Yeah, and what             
     you think?                 

1003
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:36,858
     You go.                    
     I'll stay. You got Cedric. 

1004
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:40,328
           I think one of us    
           has gotta stay here, 
           not just Richard.    

1005
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:43,065
        In fact,                
        I'm gonna insist on it. 

1006
01:01:43,067 --> 01:01:45,033
     All right, that's          
     cool. I'll go.             

1007
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:46,034
 Me and Cedric got it.          

1008
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:53,475
 You gonna be all right,        
 just you and Richard here?     

1009
01:01:53,477 --> 01:01:56,878
            Yeah, we get along, 
            if I don't have     
            to talk to him.     

1010
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,983
 You all right, man?            

1011
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:05,053
 Look like you got              
 things on your mind.           
 You worried about something?   

1012
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,422
        Oh, no, I'm not         
        worried about anything. 

1013
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,994
            Never been          
            happier in my life. 

1014
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:40,989
         Ah!                    

1015
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,060
   Do you mind? It's my bag.    

1016
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:46,795
    No, I don't, actually.      

1017
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:51,533
 All right.                     
 Well, you can take my money,   
 my Coppertone, and Kleenex,    

1018
01:02:51,535 --> 01:02:53,502
 but leave my driver's license. 

1019

1020
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:02,477
                       Melanie. 

1021
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:05,413
                Is he upstairs? 

1022
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:08,784
  Or did he leave the island?   

1023
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:11,119
              Oh.               

1024
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:14,222
            ORDELL: Yeah. "Oh."

1027
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:27,335
            Help!               

1028
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:30,372
            Please!             

1029
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:31,373
 You want to tell               
 us where he at now?

     Yes! Please!

             Ta-da.

01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:06,441
       You want a drink?        

1037
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:07,843
             Yeah, screwdriver. 

1038
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:10,278
               Coming right up. 

1039
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,480
      Why don't you give        
      him a call, sweetie?      

1040
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:15,984
 All right. I got               
 something to tell you first.   

1041
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:20,021
   Think it's gonna             
   mess up your scam,           
   but don't blame me, okay?    

1042
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,890
      It's the timing.          

1043
01:04:21,892 --> 01:04:23,592
                   What timing? 

1044
01:04:23,594 --> 01:04:27,562
 He filed for divorce           
 two days before                
 he came down here.             

1045
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:30,565
 When she gets back,            
 if she gets back,              

1046
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:32,400
 the divorce papers             
 are waiting for her.           

1047
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,270
                  Huh.          

1048
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:38,139
 You tell him                   
 he's never gonna               
 see his wife again.            

1049
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:40,342
 He doesn't want to             
 see his wife again.            

1050
01:04:40,344 --> 01:04:44,279
 You just saved him             
 maybe 100 grand                
 a year in alimony.             

1051
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,215
           He said that to you? 

1052
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:50,518
  He didn't have to.            
  I know him.                   

1053
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:54,089
 You told him not to go to      
 the cops, so he won't.         

1054
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:56,524
 And legally,                   
 he's not supposed to           
 deal with extortionists.       

1055
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:59,461
 So he's in the free and clear. 

1056
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:03,231
    So we just let her go home? 

1057
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:06,534
 And then he goes               
 home and gets divorced,        
 but where does that leave you? 

1058
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:09,905
 Look, I'm willing              
 to cooperate with you          
 'cause I like you.             

1059
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:12,207
 I feel bad for you.            
                    Aw, you do? 

1060
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:15,076
 And I don't want to end up     
 in the fucking ocean again.    

1061
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,346
                Cooperate how?  

1062
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:21,049
 What about if you...           

1063
01:05:21,051 --> 01:05:22,984
   You disappeared              
   for 100 grand?               

1064
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,353
              A hundred grand?  

1065
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:27,155
 A hundred thousand.            

1066
01:05:27,157 --> 01:05:29,257
 I think that's a good          
 choice for you right now.      

1067
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:30,659
            It ain't a million. 

1068
01:05:30,661 --> 01:05:32,260
 No, but it's not               
 a sack of wet shit either.     

1069
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,262
 Do you want my help?           

1070
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:37,098
 Listen, you're not             
 getting a million              
 bucks from him.                

1071
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,268
   You couldn't even get        
   it out of the country.       

1072
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:43,939
 All I'm saying                 
 is quit dreaming               
 and get realistic.             

1073
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:47,309
 You might as                   
 well get something.            

1074
01:05:47,311 --> 01:05:50,412
 But if she were dead,          
 I could get you more.          

1075
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:54,182
                      Oh.

 Yeah. "Oh."

 Don't kid me.

    No. I'm not kidding you.    
    I'm not kidding you at all.

         Yeah, we all set.      

1091
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,233
      Now Louis upstairs, yeah? 

1092
01:06:45,235 --> 01:06:48,269
     <i> He's always upstairs.</i>     
     <i> I think he's fucking her.</i> 

1093
01:06:48,271 --> 01:06:50,071
      He's fucking us           
      by fucking her.           

1094
01:06:50,073 --> 01:06:54,009
 But, you know, I go up there,  
 and they're not doing it.

  <i> You take her on home, okay?</i>  

1101
01:07:11,628 --> 01:07:13,328
            Uh-huh.             

1102
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:15,563
               You tell Louis   
               to follow you.   

1103
01:07:15,565 --> 01:07:18,133
        You take                
        the woman in the house. 

1104
01:07:18,135 --> 01:07:21,236
     You put her in the closet. 
     You lock her up.           

1105
01:07:21,238 --> 01:07:23,438
 <i> Cut the phone wires</i>

1108
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:30,478
           Richard?             
         Huh, what?             

1109
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:35,250
        <i> Okay. Now, Richard,</i>    
        <i> this next part</i>         
        <i> is very important.</i>     

1110
01:07:35,252 --> 01:07:39,254
    You got to do it            
    without Louis knowing, too. 

1111
01:07:39,256 --> 01:07:42,757
             When he's gone,    
             I need you to go   
             back to the house. 

1112
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:47,495
              I need you        
              to kill the lady. 

1113
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:50,398
            I do?               

1114
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,300
     <i> Yeah, you do.</i>             
     <i> You need to kill her.</i>

1116
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:56,171
              She knows         
              who you are, man. 

1117
01:07:56,173 --> 01:07:58,173
 She told you that?             

1118
01:07:58,175 --> 01:07:59,374
           She heard your name, 
           she saw your face.   

1119
01:07:59,376 --> 01:08:00,675
            That's what the Jew 
            lady told me, man.  

1120
01:08:00,677 --> 01:08:02,710
       <i> She said she</i>            
       <i> knows who you are.</i>      

1121
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:05,747
 You know,                      
 I wondered about that. I did.  
 I wondered about that.         

1122
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,482
 <i> You ain't got no choice, man.</i> 

1123
01:08:07,484 --> 01:08:09,117
       I don't want to see you, 
       I don't want to see      

1124
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:11,119
         nobody go to jail      
         behind this, man.      

1125
01:08:11,121 --> 01:08:13,721
         So, you know,          
         you gotta take         
         the Jew lady out.      

1126
01:08:13,723 --> 01:08:17,125
      But listen.               
      You cannot tell Louis.    

1127
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:18,526
 You know something?            

1128
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:19,727
        <i> What's that?</i>           

1129
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:24,299
    I knew she was a Jew.       
    I could tell.               

1130
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,603
           (LAUGHTER)           
 <i> Hey, Rollo.</i>                   
 <i> What's happening, man?</i>

        <i> Look here, I wanna ask</i> 
        <i> you a question. Uh...</i>

          <i> Does that look like</i>

 <i> You mean that marijuana?</i>      

1134
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:41,549
        <i> Say, look there, baby.</i> 
        <i> It's just about ready</i>  
        <i> to be harvested, too.</i>  

1135
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:45,453
       Yeah, I know. Get a car. 
       What else did he say?    

1136
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:48,289
          I told you.           

1137
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,791
                  I mean his    
                  exact words.  

1138
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:54,329
       His exact words were,    
       "It's all set."          

1139
01:08:54,331 --> 01:08:57,132
           What does that mean? 
           Why didn't he        
           ask to talk to me?   

1140
01:08:57,134 --> 01:09:00,668
 Because he said                
 I could tell you.              

1141
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:03,338
 It was all set about           
 taking the woman home,         

1142
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,306
 about you going                
 and getting a car,             

1143
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:07,809
 about you putting              
 her in the trunk.              

1144
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:10,378
 That's all he                  
 goddamn said, man!             

1145
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,613
               What are you     
               getting mad for? 

1146
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:14,849
        I ain't mad.            

1147
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:21,156
 It's just when I say           
 something, it's the truth.     

1148
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:24,425
         Yeah. That's cool,     
         Richard. Nothing to be 
         upset about, man.      

1149
01:09:24,427 --> 01:09:26,761
          I just wanna make     
          sure I understand it. 

1150
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:30,465
          You know what I mean? 

1151
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:33,168
 He said it's all set           
 and he had the money.          

1152
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:36,804
                            Ah. 

1153
01:09:36,806 --> 01:09:41,242
             I must have missed 
             that part. He did  
             get the money.     

1154
01:09:41,244 --> 01:09:42,877
                Good. See,      
                I was wondering 
                about that.     

1155
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,480
 Where you going?               

1156
01:09:45,482 --> 01:09:47,749
    To get a car, like he said. 

1157
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:50,952
   Line up                      
   transportation for tonight.  
   I'll be back in a half-hour.

       LOUIS:<i> Guess what.</i>       

1159
01:09:58,627 --> 01:09:59,961
             You're going home. 

1160
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,464
          When?                 
 Later on.                      

1161
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:11,506
       He paid you?             

1162
01:10:11,508 --> 01:10:14,209
          We're gonna drop you  
          home in a little bit. 

1163
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:15,677
 Wait a second. Wait.           

1164
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:19,280
 My husband paid you?           

1165
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:23,585
          I guess he must have. 

1166
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:25,653
 But you're not sure.           

1167
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:27,956
                Yeah, I'm sure. 

1168
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:29,257
           Eat your dinner.     
           It's ham and cabbage 
           with creamed corn.   

1169
01:10:29,259 --> 01:10:32,594
 No. Something's not right.     

1170
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:34,262
 I don't believe you.           
         I gotta go downstairs. 
         I'll be back.          

1171
01:10:34,264 --> 01:10:36,664
    Wait a second. Listen.      

1172
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:38,366
 Are you gonna kill me?         

1173
01:10:38,368 --> 01:10:39,801
                     No.        

1174
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:43,504
 Come on.                       
 I will not say a word.         

1175
01:10:43,506 --> 01:10:45,873
 I will not go to the police.   
 I won't say anything.          

1176
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:48,576
             Won't help your    
             husband any.       
 Wait!                          

1177
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:50,445
 This doesn't happen this way!  

1178

                What the hell's 
                wrong with you? 

1390
01:27:03,485 --> 01:27:07,254
 What if they                   
 weren't bluffing, Frank?       

1391
01:27:07,256 --> 01:27:09,389
      Okay, you're getting      
      a little hysterical here. 

1392
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:11,558
           I told them          
           right from the start 
           I wasn't gonna pay.  

1393
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,293
 Okay.                          
 Did you go to the police?      

1394
01:27:13,295 --> 01:27:14,928
 No. I couldn't.                
 They said if I did...          

1395
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:16,530
 That's when they               
 threatened your life.          

1396
01:27:16,532 --> 01:27:18,732
          But I thought they    
          were bluffing, honey. 

1397
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:21,368
 This isn't                     
 simple to explain.             

1398
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:23,837
                     Okay.      
 At first,                      
 I didn't do anything.          

1399
01:27:23,839 --> 01:27:25,539
 And then I knew,               
 as soon as I talked            
 to them again,                 

1400
01:27:25,541 --> 01:27:28,942
  I knew that                   
  they'd back off.              

1401
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:33,380
 And that there wasn't          
 really anything                
 serious to worry about.        

1402
01:27:33,382 --> 01:27:36,283
 Other than, of course,         
 what you went through.         

1403
01:27:36,285 --> 01:27:38,919
 I imagine                      
 it was a pretty                
 frightening experience.        

1404
01:27:42,857 --> 01:27:46,393
      You're not gonna tell me. 

1405
01:27:46,395 --> 01:27:48,395
       But I know what you did, 
       you know what you did,   

1406
01:27:48,397 --> 01:27:50,564
       and that's all that      
       matters, isn't it? So... 

1407
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,335
                  Isn't it?     

1408
01:28:00,642 --> 01:28:03,510
 I got the divorce papers.      
 They were waiting              
 for me when I got home.        

1409
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:05,879
    Now, obviously they         
    were sent way before        

1410
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:07,981
            I knew anything     
            about a kidnapping. 

1411
01:28:10,885 --> 01:28:13,620
        (EXHALES) Are you       
        gonna marry her?        

1412
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:17,457
 Listen, instead of             
 discussing what                
 I feel is personal,            

1413
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:19,526
           I think it was Henry 
           Kissinger that said, 

1414
01:28:19,528 --> 01:28:21,662
   "Never complain.             
   Never explain."              

1415
01:28:21,664 --> 01:28:22,929
 (SCOFFS)                       

1416
01:28:22,931 --> 01:28:26,033
      That was Henry Ford,      

1417
01:28:26,035 --> 01:28:29,403
     when he was                
     arrested for drunk         
     driving in California      

1418
01:28:29,405 --> 01:28:30,837
              with another      
              woman in his car. 

1419
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:36,076
                     So...      

1420
01:28:36,078 --> 01:28:40,047
             What do I get?     
             What's my part     
             of the settlement? 

1421
01:28:40,049 --> 01:28:42,582
 Well, we sell the house,       
 split the equity.              

1422
01:28:42,584 --> 01:28:46,053
 It's about 200,000,            
 plus alimony, child support.   

1423
01:28:46,055 --> 01:28:50,657
     And then we divide the     
     money you're sneaking into 
     the Freeport account?      

1424
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:52,759
 There is no Freeport           
 bank account in my name        

1425
01:28:52,761 --> 01:28:55,862
 and there is no possible       
 way anyone can prove it.       

1426
01:28:55,864 --> 01:28:58,498
 You want to look in my books?  

1427
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,334
                       Mmm-mmm. 

1428
01:29:00,336 --> 01:29:04,037
    No, but I would like to see 
    your apartment buildings.   

1429
01:29:04,039 --> 01:29:09,409
    Your refrigerators, ranges, 
    all of your appliances.     

1430
01:29:09,411 --> 01:29:11,812
           How you save money   
           on stolen materials. 

1431
01:29:11,814 --> 01:29:13,914
 How do you know about that?    

1432
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:18,352
           And how you pay      
           your old buddy Ray   
           Shelby to front you. 

1433
01:29:18,354 --> 01:29:20,087
   And without even             
   getting into the kidnapping, 

1434
01:29:20,089 --> 01:29:22,856
        I could stir up enough  
        to just nail your ass.  

1435
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:24,558
 Look, I don't know             
 what you think you know.       

1436
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,826
                    Couldn't I? 

1437
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:29,529
            I mean, if I was    
            the type of person  

1438
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:31,064
           that wanted to       
           see you go to jail.  

1439
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:36,937
                         Frank. 

1440
01:29:36,939 --> 01:29:38,004
            What?               

1441
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:42,075
         Are you gonna marry... 
         What's her name?       

1442
01:29:43,578 --> 01:29:45,679
      I hope to.                

1443
01:29:45,681 --> 01:29:46,847
           You mean if you      
           don't go to jail.    

1444
01:29:46,849 --> 01:29:48,815
 No, that's not what I meant.   

1445
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,686
             Oh, we're          
             just wasting time. 

1446
01:29:52,688 --> 01:29:54,588
                Let's wait till 
                I get a lawyer. 

1447
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:56,857
          Fine.                 

1448
01:29:56,859 --> 01:29:59,459
   But before you get           
   an expensive divorce lawyer, 

1449
01:29:59,461 --> 01:30:01,528
 just know it comes             
 out of the settlement.         

1450
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:03,697
  Just so much in               
  the kitty, kitty.             

1451
01:30:03,699 --> 01:30:05,031
               Watch it.        

1452
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:08,568
 Can I ask you a question?      

1453
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:09,936
          Yeah, sure. Go ahead. 

1454
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:13,540
          Did they              

1455
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:18,478
 take advantage of you or...    

1456
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:23,750
                 Mmm-mmm.       

1457
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:26,653
 Something happened to you.     

1458
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:29,790
           You're different.    

1459
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:35,595
                    Hey.        

1460
01:30:37,498 --> 01:30:39,933
 Finally changed your           
 clothes. You look nice.        

1461
01:30:40,935 --> 01:30:43,170
 Fancy pants.                   

1462
01:30:43,172 --> 01:30:45,639
  These are my culottes.        

1463
01:30:45,641 --> 01:30:48,208
 Well, they're pretty cool.     
                     (CHUCKLES) 

1464
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:49,910
 And no bra?                    

1465
01:30:49,912 --> 01:30:51,945
       I have one on.           

1466
01:30:51,947 --> 01:30:53,113
      I have more than one bra. 

1467
01:30:55,783 --> 01:30:58,151
            Anyway, I gotta     
            tell you somethin'. 

1468
01:30:59,921 --> 01:31:02,055
               Hear that?       
 What?                          

1469
01:31:02,057 --> 01:31:05,225
  "I gotta tell you             
  somethin'." I sound like you. 

1470
01:31:05,227 --> 01:31:08,128
    I say that?                 
                     (CHUCKLES) 

1471
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:10,530
    Anyway,                     
    what I was gonna say was,   
    I didn't come for this bra. 

1472
01:31:10,532 --> 01:31:14,868
   I just... I needed somebody  
   to talk to, and, you know... 

1473
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:16,770
       Is it all right that     
       I just invited myself?   

1474
01:31:16,772 --> 01:31:19,673
 Yeah, sure.                    
 Sure, it is,                   
 but there's one problem.       

1475
01:31:19,675 --> 01:31:22,609
          See, I was trying     
          to talk to my husband 
          finally and...        

1476
01:31:22,611 --> 01:31:24,211
           Wait. What problem?  

1477
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:28,915
            Oh, Ordell is back. 
            I know that.        

1478
01:31:28,917 --> 01:31:31,084
 Yeah, but he's not alone.

1485
01:31:57,245 --> 01:31:59,746
 Make yourself comfortable.     
 Have a seat.

   the neighborhood,

 say hi to the old gang.

 Oh, no, we ain't

 you know, some folks.

                   Louis, who's 
                   your friend? 

1497
01:32:33,949 --> 01:32:37,083
 I thought you two              
 were introduced.               
 Melanie, Mickey.               

1498
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:40,186
                    Bullshit.   

1499
01:32:40,188 --> 01:32:42,289
 Mickey says her old            
 man's divorcing her.           

1500
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:46,092
        Really?                 

1501
01:32:46,094 --> 01:32:47,127
                   MICKEY: Mmm. 

1502
01:32:48,796 --> 01:32:51,064
 And I don't want to            
 interfere with his new life.   

1503
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:52,566
 Mine, either.                  

1504
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:55,335
              This is the part  
              where I say what? 

1505
01:32:56,971 --> 01:32:58,238
 What, you don't believe me?    

1506
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,107
                MELANIE: Uh-uh. 

1507
01:33:01,109 --> 01:33:03,176
 Do you want me to              
 describe the apartment         
 in Freeport?                   

1508
01:33:03,178 --> 01:33:04,644
           Ordell's been there. 

1509
01:33:05,646 --> 01:33:07,781
     All right.                 

1510
01:33:07,783 --> 01:33:12,085
 Well, how about the            
 birthmark two inches from      
 the base of his spine?         

1511
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:14,854
 Assuming, of course,           
 that you've been there.        

1512
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:19,125
           I gotta take a leak. 

1513
01:33:19,127 --> 01:33:20,226
 Just sit still. Sit still.     

1514
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:26,633
                  Hold on. Hmm. 

1515
01:33:26,635 --> 01:33:30,670
   Now the woman said           
   that the man is              
   gonna divorce her.           

1516
01:33:30,672 --> 01:33:33,273
 He's not coming back.          
 He don't want to               
 make a new start.              

1517
01:33:33,275 --> 01:33:35,609
    Mmm-mmm.                    
 ORDELL: Hmm.                   

1518
01:33:35,611 --> 01:33:37,811
             So I got it wrong, 
             baby. I mean,      

1519
01:33:37,813 --> 01:33:40,947
     I can't help if he         
     tells her one thing        
     and then tells me another. 

1520
01:33:40,949 --> 01:33:42,749
 Or if she's pissed.            

1521
01:33:44,018 --> 01:33:45,218
 Are you mad at anybody?        

1522
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:48,855
     No, not at all.            

1523
01:33:50,224 --> 01:33:53,860
     No, she's not mad.         

1524
01:33:53,862 --> 01:33:56,363
       This is bullshit.        
       Would you mind terribly? 

1525
01:34:02,103 --> 01:34:03,903
                   MICKEY: Hmm. 

1526
01:34:03,905 --> 01:34:07,807
      There she goes,           
      future Mrs. Dawson.       

1527
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:09,976
               She looks like   
               a million bucks. 

1528
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:21,955
        Did he tell you he      
        was gonna marry her?    

1529
01:34:21,957 --> 01:34:24,357
      Mmm-hmm.                  

1530
01:34:24,359 --> 01:34:26,359
           And live with        
           her until he does.   

1531
01:34:30,031 --> 01:34:31,197
                Hmm.            

1532
01:34:32,199 --> 01:34:33,266
        Hmm!                    

1533
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:39,305
                 (FLUSHING)     

1534
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:44,744
       MELANIE: You know, guys, 
       I was thinking we        
       should call Frank        

1535
01:34:44,746 --> 01:34:46,312
 and then we'd all be together. 

1536
01:34:48,115 --> 01:34:49,115
                  ORDELL: Yeah. 

1537
01:34:50,451 --> 01:34:51,451
 Sure.                          

1538
01:34:54,255 --> 01:34:55,855
              Let's call        
              the motherfucker.
