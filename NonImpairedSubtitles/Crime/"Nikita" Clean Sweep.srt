1
00:00:04,787 --> 00:00:06,457
Previously on <i>Nikita...</i>

2
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:07,601
I may have a lead on Nikita.

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,262
Oversight is thinking about
executing "Clean Sweep".

4
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:13,180
What the hell is that?

5
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,891
Years ago,
when Percy created Division,

6
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,851
Oversight insisted
he build in a fail-safe.

7
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:19,269
There's a tanker of VX gas

8
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:20,812
tapped into Division's
ventilation system.

9
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:22,816
20 minutes after Oversight
pulls the trigger,

10
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:24,024
the place will be
a mass grave.

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,275
Why is Oversight doing this?

12
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:27,903
Thanks to you,
Division has become expendable.

13
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,196
You're planning an escape,
which we both know

14
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,947
is impossible.

15
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:32,542
There is no way out of here.

16
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,242
No way that you can see.

17
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:35,827
But you will.

18
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:36,995
We have to get
out of here, now.

19
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:38,955
On your knees!

20
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:41,333
I take my orders from
the same man I always have.

21
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,019
That's one
of the Guardians.

22
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:44,304
That's why
they were gathering,

23
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:45,837
their target was Oversight.

24
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:47,422
Percy.

25
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:53,512
<font color="#3399FF">Sync and correction by Mlmlte</font>
<font color="#3399FF">www.addic7ed.com</font>

26
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,368
Release Percy, or you eliminate
the members of Oversight.

27
00:00:58,493 --> 00:00:59,843
That's correct.

28
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:03,480
Sounds good to me.

29
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:05,816
Keep listening.

30
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:08,610
Failure to comply will result

31
00:01:08,776 --> 00:01:11,196
in the activation
of Clean Sweep.

32
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,550
Which means
now it won't take me more

33
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:16,085
than 30 seconds
to launch the program.

34
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,996
If you attempt evacuation,
we trigger it immediately.

35
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:21,873
How would they know
if she evac'd?

36
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,583
Roan. Percy's got him
on the inside.

37
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:24,777
Guys, shh.

38
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:26,753
And everyone inside
your facility dies.

39
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:30,674
Percy will give you
instructions for the next step.

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,093
There's a flaw
in your plan.

41
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,803
Really?

42
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:38,474
If Clean Sweep releases
VX gas through the facility,

43
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,843
everyone dies,
including you.

44
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,602
I can live with that.

45
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:46,332
The captain goes down
with the ship.

46
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,418
Percy's bluffing.

47
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:50,026
He's not.

48
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:51,170
My mother told me
Clean Sweep

49
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:53,822
could be activated
from anywhere.

50
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,448
Yeah,
but it can be deactivated

51
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,094
from the ventilation control.

52
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,270
Percy would have
thought of that.

53
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,005
Get me an E.O.D. unit down here,
right away.

54
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,789
I need to get
through this door.

55
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:19,148
There has to be
a way to stop this.

56
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,682
There is.

57
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:22,652
Kill the Guardian,
grab the trigger.

58
00:02:22,777 --> 00:02:24,537
Whoa, what are
we talking about here,

59
00:02:24,662 --> 00:02:25,979
saving Division?

60
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,939
It's saving lives.

61
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:29,483
Yeah, lives that
are trying to kill us.

62
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,527
You want to save them so they
can keep trying to kill us?

63
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,196
It's not about saving
Division, Birkhoff.

64
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:37,491
It's about ending this.
Our way, not Percy's.

65
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,554
We're gonna need directions
to Oversight.

66
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:42,746
I'll tell you
on the way there.

67
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,291
[Scoffs]
You tried to kill us,

68
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,792
what makes you think
you're along for the ride?

69
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,344
I was just trying
to protect my family.

70
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:49,544
Still am.

71
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,922
Sean, we're going
out there to save her.

72
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,049
Well then you'll need a lot
more than just her location.

73
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,884
You'll need
a tactical breakdown

74
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,427
of the perimeter
and the interior.

75
00:02:57,935 --> 00:02:59,095
You need me there.

76
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,267
You're holding four prominent
Americans at gunpoint,

77
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:06,853
right now, no one knows.

78
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,230
The second
you touch the trigger,

79
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,283
you create national news,

80
00:03:10,408 --> 00:03:12,568
and a nationwide manhunt.

81
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,860
Think about it.

82
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:16,622
Oh, I appreciate
your concern,

83
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:20,326
but Percy's got a plan.

84
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,512
Was it Percy's plan
to end up in a cell?

85
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,963
No.

86
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:24,955
He was betrayed.

87
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,582
Like hell.

88
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:30,335
Percy's the traitor.
He sold out his country,

89
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,304
and one day,
he's going to sell you out,

90
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:32,754
only you're too stupid
to see it.

91
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,633
Ah, oh.

92
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,999
Anyone else got a salient
point they'd like to share?

93
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:46,202
It'll take Phelps' team two
hours to dismantle that bomb.

94
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:47,978
You haven't got that long.

95
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,646
I won't give you Division.

96
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:53,109
You say that as though
you had a choice.

97
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,994
I'll let you go.

98
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:58,998
In exchange
for the Clean Sweep trigger.

99
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:00,833
Go where?

100
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:04,387
That would be your choice.

101
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:05,955
But if you try
to return to Division,

102
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,861
I'll have you shot on sight.

103
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:13,012
Hm.

104
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:15,231
You taught me
a good negotiation

105
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:18,217
is one in which both parties
leave slightly disappointed.

106
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,019
You get to live,
which is disappointing to me,

107
00:04:20,144 --> 00:04:25,074
I remain in control of Division,
which is disappointing to you.

108
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,526
Queen of the understatement.

109
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:27,994
State it any way you like.

110
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:32,355
These are my terms.

111
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:36,026
Just the navigator.

112
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,539
No weapon, and you listen
to everything we say.

113
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:40,697
You got a t-shirt
I can borrow?

114
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:41,948
No.

115
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:43,376
Birkhoff, please,

116
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:46,870
think of a way to remotely
deactivate the trigger.

117
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,065
I told you, I would have seen
this system if it existed,

118
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,633
okay, it's not enough just
to pump gas in there,

119
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:51,833
you have to close off
the outside vents,

120
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,752
shut down the elevators,

121
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,438
all that takes power.

122
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:59,892
And I personally retailored
the electrical grid when I...

123
00:05:00,017 --> 00:05:01,144
Was there.

124
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:03,196
What?

125
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:04,781
The old generator.

126
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:06,056
The emergency backup?

127
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,808
No, no, no, the generator that
used to power the missile base.

128
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:11,037
Can you hack it?

129
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:12,455
The only way
to shut that thing down

130
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,147
is to cut the hard-line,
up close and personal.

131
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:17,860
Well, we can't get in there.

132
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,921
I can.

133
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:27,202
Alex, that place is a gas
chamber waiting to happen.

134
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,222
If I hadn't
sent that bank transfer,

135
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:30,957
the Guardians wouldn't
be where they are right now.

136
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:33,559
I need to do this.

137
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:37,570
And I'm the only one who can.

138
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:44,594
Okay.

139
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,887
Alex heads to Division.

140
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,599
We head to Oversight.

141
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,833
Can I speak with you
for a second?

142
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:57,783
So that's two Guardians,

143
00:05:57,908 --> 00:06:01,319
Amanda, and one rogue Navy Seal.

144
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:03,697
That's a lot of variables
for one mission.

145
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,408
At least we know what
the variables are,

146
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,468
right?

147
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,498
Contact the safe house
in Brighton Beach,

148
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,367
put them on standby.

149
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:16,209
[Door opens]

150
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:17,752
Thank you
for coming down, sir.

151
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,056
What is it?
I'm busy.

152
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:21,724
We've had some success

153
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,175
tracking the Guardian
we lost in Basel.

154
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:26,195
Spyder picked up
on his image in Amsterdam,

155
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:28,648
where he met with another man,

156
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:31,141
whom we also believe to be
one of Percy's Guardians.

157
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,152
Do you believe they have
the Black Boxes with them?

158
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:34,737
I assume so.

159
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,572
The two men traveled
to Brussels via rail,

160
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:39,566
where they chartered a private jet
to Newark International.

161
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,328
I've yet to pinpoint
their current location,

162
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,413
but I would like to retask
the team assigned to hunting

163
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,364
for Alexandra
and put them on the trail.

164
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,368
So, now, Black Boxes are more
important than Alexandra?

165
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:53,339
They both hold secrets
about you, sir,

166
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:55,248
secrets we want to destroy.

167
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:59,436
Just make sure that your team
hits their mark this time.

168
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,467
Your master and I have reached
a new agreement.

169
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,577
There'll be no new agreement.

170
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:10,907
Talk to him yourself.

171
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:12,742
Hold your position.

172
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:16,753
I'm coming to you.

Well, it's definitely
the right place.

3 stories including the cellar,

177
00:08:24,823 --> 00:08:26,381
and at least one point
of egress on every side.

178

Is our line still open?

moving the hostages.

No, wait, whoa, whoa.

enhanced killers in there

190

If we go in hot,
they will hear,

191
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:09,757
and that means everyone in that
house and Division will die.

long-distance shots.

195
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:18,168
They're the only ones
we're going to get.

196
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:19,475
It will be faster
if we split up.

197
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:20,810
No.

198
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:24,382
We do the sweep together.

199
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:29,263
You know, this would be a

200
00:09:29,388 --> 00:09:30,737

just trusted me.

201
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,249
It's not about trust,

202
00:09:32,374 --> 00:09:33,801
it's about making sure
you've got this down.

203
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:36,451
Okay, this ain't like
plugging in a toaster.

204
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,372
Now one more time, once you
get down into the silo,

what are you gonna do?

206
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,675
I hit up
the generator access panel,

207
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,625
I plug your phone in, and
your program drains the power.

208
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,834
Right. Now keep in mind,
this thing has

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,213
a three-phase transformer
with a four-wire output, okay?

You know, if I'd
had this last year,

217
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,734
I wouldn't have had
to use that shell program.

are you going to tell Amanda?

she wants to hear.

00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:31,842
and you might
not live to see tomorrow.

326
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:35,137
How the hell did Percy get
a weapon?

327
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:38,182
Percy has a silent partner
inside Division.

328
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:40,309
Right now,
Roan is my prime suspect.

329
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,186
That would be a good guess.

330
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,661
I've been following
his movements.

331
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:46,797
But I'm concerned

332
00:17:46,922 --> 00:17:50,277
he may be collaborating
with others.

333
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:54,672
In fact, the only person I know
he's not working with is you.

334
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:55,866
You've been away.

335
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,452
Do me a favor.

336
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:01,330
Keep an eye on him,
report back to me.

337
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:02,896
Once I know who
he's working with,

338
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:07,992
I intend to drown him in
a pool of his own acid.

339
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:44,321
Hey, it's me,
we have a problem.

340
00:18:44,446 --> 00:18:46,356
With the generator?

341
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:47,775
With Percy.

342
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,928
He was on his way to you, and he took out
the Alpha team that was escorting him.

343
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:52,006
Where is he now?

344
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,507
He disabled
the vehicle tracker.

345
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:54,581
What are you gonna do?

346
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:56,218
You just focus
on your objective.

347
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:58,068
Now that Amanda's lost
her leverage over Percy,

348
00:18:58,193 --> 00:19:00,838
nothing's going to stop him
from hitting that trigger.

349
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:03,631
Alex, you are our best shot
at stopping Clean Sweep.

350
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:12,818
Enjoying the countryside?

351
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:14,751
Eh, the ragweed,

352
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:16,030
doesn't agree with me.

353
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,588
Take an allergy pill.

354
00:19:18,713 --> 00:19:20,534
Roan's gun came in handy.

355
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,913
What about the hostages?

356
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,415
Tell them to sit tight.

357
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:30,336
I can't wait to see them.

358
00:19:30,776 --> 00:19:34,548
I've spent my life
in the military.

359
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:39,011
I understand what it is to be
beholden to your C.O.

360
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:41,096
that sense of duty,

361
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:42,598
obeying the orders,

362
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,559
following them into
the jaws of death.

363
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:47,885
But you don't have
to get caught up in this war,

364
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,146
you have options.

365
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:51,065
If you had a little money
in your pocket,

366
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,691
more than a little,

367
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:55,611
you wouldn't have
to answer to Percy

368
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,949
anymore.

369
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,631
According to
local news reports,

370
00:20:01,756 --> 00:20:03,300
a small
recreational plane

371
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:05,871
crashed just outside
of Saratoga National Park.

372
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:08,105
The pilot, one Darren Smalls,

373
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,834
had just signed
up two passengers

374
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,325
for skydiving,

375
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,443
but only his body
was recovered from the wreckage.

376
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:15,464
The names of the passengers

377
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,843
match the names on the fake
passports used by the Guardians.

378
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,303
You believe they jumped
out of this plane?

379
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:22,847
Where could they be headed?

380
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,339
The only structure of note

381
00:20:25,464 --> 00:20:29,186
within a 20 kilometer radius
of the crash,

382
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:30,855
is an old historical landmark,

383
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,357
the Gates house.

384
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,515
Satellite imagery
of the location

385
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,682
reveals several
vehicles outside.

386
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:37,194
I think they're
there right now.

387
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,445
Is the team on their way?

388
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:41,795
En route as we speak.

389
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,713
You sure we shouldn't
be wearing bomb suits?

390
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,488
This thing goes off
in this corridor,

391
00:20:58,613 --> 00:21:02,469
concussion alone would
turn us into jelly.

392
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:06,037
Plus, the suit makes
my hands sweat.

393
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,366
One down, three to go.

394
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:26,183
I'm going to head up,

395
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:31,228
grab some magnetized
soldering wire.

396
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,299
[Neck snaps]

397
00:22:07,221 --> 00:22:08,118
Hi, Percy.

398
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,586
{pub}You, here.

399
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,184
What are the odds?

400
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:34,369
Tell your Guardians to
give up the Clean Sweep trigger,

401
00:22:34,494 --> 00:22:35,729
and Oversight,

402
00:22:35,946 --> 00:22:38,290
and you may get
out of here alive.

403
00:22:38,415 --> 00:22:39,400
Michael,

404
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,527
I see you're embracing the whole
"rebel without a cause" motif,

405
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,405
right down to the hairstyle.

406
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:48,250
Can I shoot him now?

407
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,576
Not yet.

408
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:52,204
I crashed your little
"Guardian party" in Amsterdam.

409
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,556
The Boxes are gone,

410
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:56,125
along with your
insurance policy.

411
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,626
How do you think
we got here?

412
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,544
We followed your boys.

413
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,264
Even if that were the case,

414
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:04,925
the Guardians have been given
strict instructions

415
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:08,020
to pull the trigger
and gas Division

416
00:23:08,145 --> 00:23:10,896
if anything happens to me.

417
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,028
I'm in,
I'm headed to the silo.

418
00:23:16,153 --> 00:23:17,271
Five by five.

419
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:18,730
Did Amanda give you
any trouble?

420
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:19,982
No, she's all freaked
out about Percy and Roan.

421
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,192
She asked me
to go spy on him.

422
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:23,360
But you're
blowing her off, right?

423
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:27,156
Yup.

424
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,866
What are you doing down here?

425
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:33,211
Oh, no, that's not good.

426
00:23:33,336 --> 00:23:37,266
I was actually looking
for you.

427
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,634
I know you were there

428
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:40,502
the night Division raided
my family's home.

429
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:43,047
You said "mother down",
confirming your kill.

430
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:48,193
But she wasn't dead,
was she?

431
00:23:48,318 --> 00:23:49,928
You used a tranquilizer,

432
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,599
a little special side mission
for Percy.

433
00:23:53,824 --> 00:23:57,486
I want to know the truth about
what happened on that night.

434
00:23:57,611 --> 00:24:00,656
That's not why you're here.

435
00:24:00,781 --> 00:24:02,274
Well then,
why the hell are you here?

436
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,359
Oh, just sabotaging Division.

437
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:08,739
Special little side mission
for Percy.

438
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,711
Phelps, is that you?

439
00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:24,797
[Bang]

440
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:35,766
I feel like I've landed
in an alternate universe.

441
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,859
You, fighting
to save Division.

442
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:40,445
I don't expect you
to understand me, Percy.

443
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,397
I understood your quest
for vengeance,

444
00:24:42,563 --> 00:24:44,858
retribution for your fiance.

445
00:24:45,492 --> 00:24:49,071
Do you two talk much
about Daniel?

446
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:52,157
Must be a little awkward, since
you knew about the kill order

447
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:57,045
and didn't warn her.

448
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,513
If you think anyone's going
to believe your lies,

449
00:24:58,638 --> 00:25:00,849
you're wrong.

450
00:25:00,974 --> 00:25:02,626
Owen told me
the truth about Daniel.

451
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:03,852
But does Michael
know the truth

452
00:25:03,977 --> 00:25:07,005
about you and Owen?

453
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,423
See, that's the look
that tells me

454
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:11,610
everything I need to know.

455
00:25:11,735 --> 00:25:12,970
The crack in the foundation.

456
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,055
I don't blame you.

457
00:25:15,272 --> 00:25:16,807
She lured you in with
the promise of regaining

458
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,725
everything that you'd lost.

459
00:25:18,942 --> 00:25:20,435
Next thing you know,
you're knee-deep

460
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:22,396
in Nikita's war
with no end in sight.

461
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,822
That's funny.

462
00:25:23,947 --> 00:25:25,315
I see an end in sight,
right here.

463
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:27,067
Such a commanding presence.

464
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:30,320
It's like she's leading
the new crusades.

465
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:33,282
So many people willing to lay
down their lives for you.

466
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,468

over there.

That's a hell of a get.

469
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,712
I can still see your pimply face
on the family Christmas cards.

470
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,881
Looks like the Navy made
a real man out of you.

471

You're here
for Senator Madeline.

If I don't answer it,

Patrick will wonder what's
happened to me.

And if he thinks
anything's gone wrong...

I have Percy.

Give me the trigger
and release the hostages,

480

or he dies.

Son of a bitch!

I think we both know,
they had it coming.

out of the way,

00:26:45,445 --> 00:26:47,147
I'm willing to negotiate.

488
00:26:47,313 --> 00:26:49,440
I'll give you Senator Pierce,

489
00:26:49,565 --> 00:26:53,411
if you let me go
with the trigger.

Cover him.

492
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,955
We can't go along with this.

493
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,957
We have to.

494
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,725
Giving him the trigger?

495
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,626
If Alex kills
the power on site,

499
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,768
Holy crap, you're alive.

500
00:27:16,893 --> 00:27:21,014
I thought the Terminator
got you.

He's still after me.

502

Okay, Birkhoff,
I'm at the control panel.

503
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:01,930
Okay, great.
Get my phone out.

504
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:05,150
I lost the phone.
Without the program...

505
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:06,643
It's okay,
we can do it manually.

it's like unplugging a toaster.

00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:12,357
I know,
I was just being me.

509
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,775
I'll walk you through it.

You've become a world-class

you stop trying to run

Get inside the house.

Gogol agents might
be inside already.

Okay, great,
you've got one more left.

It's the black one connected

And Clean Sweep,
has it been...

558
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:02,040
Averted.

559
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,726
Percy must have lost
control of the trigger,

560
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:05,126
or perhaps it was destroyed.

Whatever the case,

I've made sure Clean Sweep will
never threaten Division again.

That's... unfortunate.

We'll get to work on
a cover story right away,

567
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,012
to explain their deaths.

568
00:34:23,137 --> 00:34:24,604
Most likely the act
of a deranged

569
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,815
domestic terrorist.

570
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,983
Yes. Make sure it looks
as though they died heroes.

00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:30,610
And once things settle down,

572
00:34:30,776 --> 00:34:33,863
we need to discuss how
to proceed with Division.

573
00:34:34,029 --> 00:34:36,616
Needless to say,
after recent events,

574
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:37,742
a low profile is in order.

575
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:39,661
Absolutely.

576

We'll discuss it next week
in Washington.

577
00:34:43,357 --> 00:34:46,402
It's probably best to keep
communications to a minimum.

578
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:48,920
As you say, we should
all keep our heads down.

580
00:34:50,647 --> 00:34:52,132
After all,
we wouldn't want to risk

your colleagues in D.C.

582

Why?

611
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,193
So you can get
a foothold in Zetrov?

612
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,804
Not interested.

613
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:21,781
You should be.

614
00:37:21,947 --> 00:37:23,959
You threaten the hold
Semak has on his empire.

615
00:37:24,084 --> 00:37:26,161
That's why he fears you.

616

Alexandra Udinov's existence

617
00:37:30,023 --> 00:37:33,402
has the potential
to shatter his world.

618
00:37:33,527 --> 00:37:34,820
Too bad the world thinks

619
00:37:34,945 --> 00:37:36,921
Alexandra Udinov is dead.

620
00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:41,400
But what if they were
to learn the truth?

621
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,779
If Division's
truly gone rogue,

622
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,598
you have no choice.

623
00:38:02,723 --> 00:38:04,282
You have to contact the CIA.

624
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,267
Yeah, what are
they going to do?

625
00:38:05,392 --> 00:38:06,743
Send in the Marines?

626
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,187
Division's an army.

627
00:38:08,312 --> 00:38:09,412
You're going to have
a war on your hands.

628
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,390
She's right.

629
00:38:11,515 --> 00:38:13,249
Enough people have died.

630
00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:15,209
It's funny.

631
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:18,087
You seem to be so concerned
about the body count now.

632
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:20,173
Didn't bother you when you were
sanctioning all those hits.

633
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,017
They were necessary.

634
00:38:22,142 --> 00:38:23,343
Oh, I'm sure
it seemed necessary

635
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,987
in this room.

636
00:38:25,112 --> 00:38:26,554
But I was the one
who had to pull the trigger.

637
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,764
You were a soldier.

638
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,993
I was a killer.

639
00:38:31,118 --> 00:38:32,461
You're right.

640
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:33,811
I don't know what it's like.

641
00:38:33,977 --> 00:38:38,024
You had to live in Division,
I didn't.

642
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,636
Which is why you're the only one
who can take it down

643
00:38:40,761 --> 00:38:44,030
without exposing it
to the public.

644
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,449
I hate to say it,
but she has a point.

645
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,428
Exposing Division
is just as bad

646
00:38:49,553 --> 00:38:50,787
as releasing the Black Boxes.

647
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:51,847
This is the person

648
00:38:51,972 --> 00:38:53,765
who put a target on our backs.

649
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,291
What if I could fix that?

650
00:38:55,457 --> 00:38:58,252
Clear your names.

If you reveal your part
in this to the President,

654
00:39:07,371 --> 00:39:08,554
you'll go to prison.

655
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,817
No.

656
00:39:11,942 --> 00:39:14,102
I would receive immunity

657
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:19,041
for my silence.

658
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,217
What do you say?

659
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,490
I thought today was going
to be the day it all ended.

660
00:39:27,707 --> 00:39:29,184
It might not have worked
out that way,

661
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:30,994
but this is the first time

662
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,915
I can see a real light
at the end of the tunnel,

663
00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:37,967
for all of us.

664
00:40:06,263 --> 00:40:11,960
[Phone dials, rings]

665
00:40:12,085 --> 00:40:13,244
We're almost there.

666
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,846
Of course,
Percy's still a problem,

667
00:40:14,971 --> 00:40:16,131
when is he not?

668
00:40:16,256 --> 00:40:17,373
He's down to Roan

669
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,792
and one Guardian,
thanks to your hit squad.

670
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,128
Then I guess their timing
was perfect.

671
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,838
How can I repay you?

672
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,443
Oh,

673
00:40:26,017 --> 00:40:27,800
I can think of a few ways.

674
00:40:30,237 --> 00:40:31,345
Time for that later,

675
00:40:31,511 --> 00:40:33,931
we still have business
to discuss.

676
00:40:34,097 --> 00:40:36,225
My superiors are no longer
an issue.

677
00:40:36,391 --> 00:40:37,986
[Sighs]

678
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:40,605
Yes, we still have my boss
to contend with.

679
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,374
Well the good news
on that front is that

680
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:44,942
I think Alexandra may
be ready to make her return.

681
00:40:45,108 --> 00:40:48,613
And Nikita?

682
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:53,385
I have a future planned
for her too.

683
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,583
It's considerably shorter.

684
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:57,622
