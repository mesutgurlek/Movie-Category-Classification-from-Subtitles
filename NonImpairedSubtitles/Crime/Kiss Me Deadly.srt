27
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,000
A thumb isn't good enough for you.
You've gotta use your whole body.

28
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,700
Would you have stopped
if l'd used my thumb?

29
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,700
No.

30
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,800
What's this all about?

31
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,900
l'll guess. You were out with some guy
who thought ''no'' was a three-letter word.

32
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,400
l should've thrown you off that cliff
back there. l might still do it.

33
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,900
- Where are you headed?
- Los Angeles.

34
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,600
Drop me off at the first bus stop.

35
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,500
Do you always go around
with no clothes on?

36
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,100
<i>(man)</i> What's the trouble<i>,</i> officer?

37
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,200
A woman escaped from an asylum
upstate. Young<i>,</i> wearing a trench coat.

38
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,600
- Seen anybody to fit that description?
- No<i>,</i> officer.

39
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,000
OK<i>,</i> move on.

40
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,900
Haven't seen a thing<i>,</i> officer.

41
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,000
- Oh<i>,</i> my wife's been asleep.
- All right<i>,</i> move on.

42
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,200
May l have my hand back now?

43
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,000
So you're a fugitive
from the laughing house.

44
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,800
They forced me to go there.
Took away my clothes to make me stay.

45
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,700
Who?

46
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,300
l wish l could tell you that.

47
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,400
l have to tell someone.

48
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,200
When people are in trouble<i>,</i>
they need to talk.

49
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
But you know the old saying.

50
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,000
What l don't know can't hurt me?

51
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,800
This wheel doesn't feel right.
lt keeps pulling over.

52
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,900
- Good evening<i>,</i> folks.
- Check the right front wheel.

53
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,700
What'd you find?

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Caught in the spindle.

55
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,300
We must've picked it up
when we went off the road back there.

56
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,900
The only thing l ever pick up
when l go off the road is poison ivy.

57
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,000
- Thanks<i>,</i> kid.
- Thank you.

58
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,200
- Would you do me a favour<i>,</i> please?
- Wouldn't mind at all.

59
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,100
Would you put a stamp on this
and drop it in the mailbox for me?

60
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,500
Yes<i>,</i> ma'am. Anything else<i>,</i> ma'am?

61
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,300
Did you find out
what was wrong with the wheel?

62
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,800
Oh<i>,</i> yeah. You picked up a piece of branch
when you took that little trip off the road.

63
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,100
So long. Come back again.

64
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,400
You're angry with me<i>,</i> aren't you?

65
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,400
Sorry l nearly wrecked
your pretty little car.

66
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,500
l was just thinking how much you can tell
about a person from such simple things.

67
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,500
- Your car<i>,</i> for instance.
- What kind of message does it send you?

68
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,400
You have only one real<i>,</i> lasting love.

69
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,700
Now who could that be?

70
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,700
You.

71
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,600
You're one of those self-indulgent males
who thinks about nothing but his clothes<i>,</i>

72
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,400
his car<i>,</i> himself...

73
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,100
Bet you do push-ups
to keep your belly hard.

74
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,900
You against good health or something?

75
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,700
l could tolerate flabby muscles in a man
if it would make him more friendly.

76
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,700
You're the kind of person who never
gives in a relationship<i>,</i> who only takes.

77
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,000
Ah<i>,</i> woman. The incomplete sex.

78
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,900
And what does she need to complete her?

79
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,000
Why<i>,</i> man<i>,</i> of course. Wonderful man.

80
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,100
All right<i>,</i> all right<i>,</i> let it go.

81
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,500
That bus stop will be coming up soon
and l don't even know your name.

82
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,300
You forget<i>,</i> l'm a loony from the laughing
house. All loonies are dangerous.

83
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,300
D'you ever read poetry?

84
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,700
No<i>,</i> of course you wouldn't.

85
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,700
Christina Rossetti wrote love sonnets.
l was named after her.

86
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,300
- Christina?
- Yes<i>,</i> Mike.

87
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,000
l got your name from
the registration certificate<i>,</i> Mr Hammer.

88
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,100
Get me to that bus stop
and you can forget you ever saw me.

89
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,100
- lf we don't make that bus stop...
- We will.

90
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,000
lf we don't...

91
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,700
remember me.

92
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,500
<i>(Christina screams)</i>

93
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,200

<i>(screams continue)</i>

95
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,100
<i>(screams stop)</i>

96
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,200
- She's passed out.
- <i>l'll</i> bring her to.

97
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,200
<i>(3rd man)</i> lf you revive her<i>,</i>
you know what that would be?

98
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,800
Resurrection<i>,</i> that's what it would be.

99
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,500
And do you know what resurrection
means? lt means ''raise the dead''.

100
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,400
Just who do you think you are
that you think you can raise the dead?

101
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,500
- <i>(2nd man)</i> Put him in the car too?
- Naturally.

102
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,900
Mike.

103
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,700
Mike.

104
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Hey<i>,</i> Mike.

105
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,200
Mike.

106
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,600
- Hi<i>,</i> Velda.
- Hi.

107
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,500
You're never around when l need you.

108
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,000
You never need me when l'm around.
Pat's here.

109
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,800
Five minutes<i>,</i> that's all you've got. Nurse.

110
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,100
- Hi<i>,</i> flatfoot.
- Hi.

111
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,400
Three days ago l was figuring l'd have
to finance a new tux to bury the corpse.

112
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,800
Three days? How am l doin'?

113
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,900
You're doin' all right. ln a couple
of weeks you'll walk out of here.

114
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,700
Can you remember<i>,</i> Mike?
How it happened<i>,</i> the whole thing?

115
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,100
l never thought l'd smell that again.

116
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,300
Ooh<i>,</i> look at all the goodies.

117
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,800
- l have a cab.
- Mr Hammer?

118
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,400
You won't need the cab.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

119
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,200
That figures. See you later.

120
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,700
- Why not come in? We may be a while.
- l'll wait here.

121
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,600
We're not getting very far<i>,</i>
are we<i>,</i> Mr Hammer?

122
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,300
Well now<i>,</i> we have most of the facts.
All we need is a little more fill-in.

123
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,100
- l almost get killed and he wants fill-in.
- ls it too much to ask for cooperation?

124
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,500
- And make 'em try it again?
- You'll be given full protection.

125
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,100
Maybe we'll have better luck
with more elementary questions.

126
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,600
Your full name please<i>,</i> Mr Hammer.

127
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,900
Michael Hammer<i>,</i>
10401 Wilshire Boulevard<i>,</i> Los Angeles.

128
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,800
- Just what do you do for a living?
- He calls himself a private investigator.

129
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,600
- His speciality is divorce cases.
- He's a bedroom dick.

130
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,100
He gets dirt on the wife<i>,</i> then does a deal
with the wife to get dirt on the husband.

131
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,400
Plays both ends against the middle.

132
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,300
How do you achieve all this?
You crawl under beds?

133
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,600
- Nothing so primitive.
- He has a secretary<i>,</i> as he calls her.

134
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,200
- What's her name<i>,</i> Mr Hammer?
- Velda Wichman.

135
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,200
She's a very attractive young woman.
Real woo-bait. Lives like a princess.

136
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,900
He sics her onto the husbands and
in no time he's ready for the big squeeze.

137
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,200
Who do you sic onto the wives<i>,</i>
Mr Hammer?

138
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,300
That's his department.

139
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,400
All right<i>,</i> you've got me convinced.
l'm a real stinker.

140
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,900
Now if that's all that's on your minds<i>,</i>
l'd like to get home.

141
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,000
Yes<i>,</i> l know. You're anxious
to get back to your life's work.

142
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,400
You're free to go.

143
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,500
Open a window.

144
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,600
Thanks for waiting<i>,</i> Pat.

145
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,400
She was a cute kid.
Had the nicest way of needling a guy.

146
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,900
There'll be a long pause
before <i>those</i> characters work this out.

147
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,800
The law isn't fast enough<i>,</i>
you could do it better - is that it?

148
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,000
Look<i>,</i> Mike<i>,</i> who do you think you are?

149
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,500
What's the pitch<i>,</i> Pat?

150
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,400
An ordinary girl is killed and it rings bells
in Washington. Gotta be a pitch.

151
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,500
l'll give you a bit of advice.

152
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,200
Too many people like you
have contempt for the law.

153
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,700
You'd like to take it into your own hands.

154
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,200
But when you do that<i>,</i>
you might as well be living in a jungle.

155
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,800
l picked up a girl. lf she hadn't gotten
in my way<i>,</i> l wouldn't have stopped.

156
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,700
She must be connected
with something big.

157
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,300
Mike<i>,</i> why don't you tell us
what you know<i>,</i>

158
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,500
then step aside like a nice fella
and let us do our job?

159
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,900
What's in it for me?

160
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,400
Mikey! Mikey!

161
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,900
<i>(gushes in Greek)</i>

162
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,800
Hey<i>,</i> Sammy! Look<i>,</i> my friend
just returned from the grave!

163
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,300
Ha-ha! Va-va-voom!

164
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,700
l'm sure glad you're back<i>,</i> Mike.
Like Lazarus<i>,</i> rose out from the grave.

165
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,300
Now tell me<i>,</i> what happened?
Did you drive too fast in that new rod?

166
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,800
Where is it?
Velda says you were picking it up.

167
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,900
There's nothing to pick up.

168
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,400
You ought to have seen that pretty little
rod of yours. All torn up. Scrap. Junk.

169
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,800
Never gonna go va-va-voom no more.
Break my heart.

170
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,500
- Anyway<i>,</i> you're all right now?
- A little shaky.

171
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,100
A little shaky<i>,</i> huh?
Know what we're gonna do?

172
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,300
We're gonna pick up
a couple of cute little Greek girls!

173
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,800
What l mean<i>,</i> va-va-voom! Pow!

174
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,700
Uh-oh. Forgot to tell you. Some guys were
looking for you. Asking a lot of questions.

175
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,600
- What kind of guys?
- Tough guys. Very tough guys<i>,</i> Mike.

176
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,200
Ah<i>,</i> forget it. Look<i>,</i> l'm glad
you're back. You look swell.

177
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,100
l'll see you tomorrow.
And take care of yourself<i>,</i> will ya?

178
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,700
Are you all right<i>,</i> Mike?

179
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,000
l don't know yet. Maybe not.

180
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,600
Oh.

181
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Hey<i>,</i> Sammy<i>,</i>
what does he mean<i>,</i> ''maybe not''?

182
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,300
Ah<i>,</i> who knows what he means.

183
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,300
<i>(phone rings)</i>

184
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,300
<i>(female voice) This is Crestview 5-4 1 24.</i>

185
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,400
<i>Mr Hammer, whom you are calling,</i>
<i>is not available at present.</i>

186
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:14,000
<i>lf you wish to leave a record of your call,</i>
<i>please state your message at the tone.</i>

187
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,800
<i>(Velda) Hello, Mike. Just checking to see</i>
<i>if you got home. Call me when you...</i>

188
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,000
Velda.

189
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,600
<i>Oh, l'm glad you're there.</i>
<i>Are you all right?</i>

190
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,800
- Sure. Why?
- <i>l'll be right over.</i>

191
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,000
<i>(hangs up)</i>

192
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,300
- What did they want?
- Asked a lot of questions.

193
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,100
- What kind of questions?
- Questions.

194
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,800
When you leave<i>,</i> tell Nick...

195
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,400
What do you want me to tell him?

196
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,500
You know<i>,</i> just to hold
the soft part of your arms is a meal...

197
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:20,000
Tell him to drop his car off tonight
and pick it up in the morning.

198
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,600
What's in the folder?

199
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,300
A fella named Ray Diker called up
while you were in the hospital.

200
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:34,000
He wants to see you and l thought
you'd want me to check up on him.

201
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,700
<i>(knock at door)</i>

202
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
Don't answer it.

203
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
<i>(another knock)</i>

204
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,700
Mike? lt's Pat. Official business this time.

205
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,000
Maybe he'll go away.

206
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,200
<i>(lock jiggles)</i>

207
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,100
Go ahead. Don't mind me.

208
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,600
l'm revoking
your private investigator's licence.

209
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,300
Also your gun permit.

210
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,900
lf l catch you snooping around with
a gun in your hand<i>,</i> l'll throw you in jail.

211
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,700
l don't think you'd like it in jail.

212
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,100
Who's Ray Diker?

213
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,200
What do you do with this guy?

214
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,600
He was a reporter on the <i>News,</i> wasn't
he? Used to write a science column.

215
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,100
Why did he drop out?

216
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,100
l hear your friends
were over to question him too.

217
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,900
l've gotta say it: he's got a nose.

218
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,500
He can sniff out information
like nobody l ever saw.

219
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
What else did you hear?

220
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,200
Couldn't find him. He dropped out of sight.

221
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,800
Science editor of a newspaper drops out
of sight and nobody knows why.

222
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,900
lf you know anything<i>,</i>
you'd better tell me<i>,</i> Mike.

223
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,400
lf l knew anything<i>,</i> l would.

224
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,200
Sure you would.

225
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,700
You ought to tell him<i>,</i> Mike.

226
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,200
- Did Diker leave an address?
- Somewhere over on Flower Street.

227
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,800
But if l were you<i>,</i> l wouldn't go.

228
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,100
- That tape of you and lover-boy got lost.
- There goes your case.

229
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,900
Call him up and set up another session.

230
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:58,700
Tell him you're sorry<i>,</i> you want
to make up for all the pain you gave him...

231
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
Give him some of that sincerity.

232
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,800
What'd you find out about the girl?

233
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,900
Christina Georgina Rossetti<i>,</i>
poetess<i>,</i> English<i>,</i> born 1830<i>,</i> died 1894.

234
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,600
Your Christina was being held
in that hospital for interrogation.

235
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,000
Who by? The feds or state?

236
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,500
That they wouldn't tell me.

237
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,600
What's the point of all this?
lf it's any of my business.

238
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,500
She told me if l dropped her off
at the bus station l could forget her.

239
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,200
But if she didn't make it<i>,</i>
she said... ''Remember me.''

240
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,500
So remember her.

241
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,100
She's dead.

242
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,000
But l'm not dead.

243
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,700
Hey<i>,</i> remember me?

244
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,700
Yeah!

245
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,600
l remember you from somewhere.

246
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,200
Weren't you supposed to call that fellow<i>,</i>
Mr... What's his name?

247
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Friendly?

248
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,700
That's my name for him - Mr Friendly.
He certainly was friendly.

249
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:22,300
Maybe he'll give you some of that
nice dialogue again<i>,</i> that honey talk.

250
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,000
That tape sure was nice.

251
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,200
Do me a favour<i>,</i> will you?
Keep away from the windows.

252
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,700
Somebody might blow you a kiss.

253
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,600
- 1 21?
- South.

254
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,100
- Popcorn?
- Yeah. How much?

255
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,900
Dime<i>,</i> like always.

256
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
Thank you.

257
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,200
Drop the knife. Drop the knife.

258
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,300
Drop the knife!

259
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,100
<i>(more knocking)</i>

260
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,100
What do you want?
<i>(whispers)</i> Force your way in.

261
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,300
- l want in!
- Who do you think you are?!

262
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,200
<i>(whispers)</i> Make it sound good.

263
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,300
- Make it sound good.
- What's on your mind?

264
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,000
You were with her the night she died.
She knew she was gonna get killed.

265
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,000
- She must've talked to you<i>,</i> told you.
- Told me what?

266
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,400
lf you knew<i>,</i> you'd be afraid<i>,</i>
like she was afraid.

267
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,300
Like l am. You'd better go.

268
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,400
She told me her name was Christina.
Christina what?

269
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,300
Bailey. Christina Bailey.

270
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,100
Her address<i>,</i> the last place she lived?

271
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,600
325 Bunker Hill.

272
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,800
<i>(loud)</i> lf you change your mind and wanna
talk<i>,</i> get in touch with my secretary.

273
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,500
<i>(accent)</i> Oh<i>,</i> you are the one.

274
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,100
Every time when l pick up the trunk<i>,</i>
l take a deep breath.

275
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,500
Make you stronger<i>,</i> deep breaths.

276
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:07,300
This time l think ''Oh<i>,</i> you breathe
good deep - trunk feels very light.''

277
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,600
''By golly<i>,</i> old man<i>,</i>
you are becoming very strong<i>,</i>'' l think.

278
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,200
But you are the one<i>,</i> eh?

279
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,600
Moving somebody in?

280
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,500
Move in<i>,</i> move out.
Always people come and go.

281
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
One place they never leave.

282
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:29,900
You know<i>,</i> 63 years l live in one place -
the house of my body.

283
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:35,000
Move in when l born<i>,</i> move out when l die.
You bet. Yes<i>,</i> sir.

284
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,400
- Can l help you?
- Oh<i>,</i> no<i>, grazie.</i> l mean thank you.

285
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,600
lf you help<i>,</i> then afterward
other thing gets heavier.

286
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,200
l go and get the other one.

287
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,700
- What do you want?
- To see the super.

288
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,000
- What can l do for you?
- Card on the mailbox<i>,</i> Christina Bailey.

289
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,800
The police have been
through her apartment.

290
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,600
The police have been
through her apartment.

291
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,200
<i>l</i> wanna go through her apartment.

292
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,400
- Ask him who he is<i>,</i> Horace.
- Tell her to shut up.

293
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,700
Shut up.

294
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,600
- Can l help you?
- l don't be fooled so easy this time.

295
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,200
ls the young fellow<i>,</i> my deep breath.

296
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,900
Always willing to help an old man
moving people around.

297
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,800
Because people<i>,</i> they always move.
They never stand still.

298
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,400
Move from here<i>,</i> from there<i>,</i>
and move all the time...

299
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:40,300
Her lease still has a month to go<i>,</i>
but the police said l could rent it.

300
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,200
Whose stuff is this?

301
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,200
We rent it furnished<i>,</i>
but she fixed it up to suit herself.

302
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,600
- No bird?
- Her roommate let it die.

303
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,500
- What's her name?
- Carver. Lily Carver.

304
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,700
She moved out a couple of days ago.
All of a sudden<i>,</i> in the middle of the night.

305
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,900
Didn't say where.

306
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,300
<i>(Schubert's ''Unfinished Symphony''</i>
<i>on radio)</i>

307
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,700
She always had it tuned to that station.

308
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,500
OK.

309
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Hey<i>,</i> mister.

310
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,100
Look<i>,</i> mister<i>,</i> you make a deep breath
for me. l'm a-gonna tell you a little secret.

311
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:20,600
The other girl<i>,</i> the roommate
of Miss Christina<i>,</i> she tells me not to say.

312
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,000
Afraid<i>,</i> she is.
Like somebody is afraid to die.

313
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,100
l moved her.

314
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,600
l tell you where.

315
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,100
<i>- Buona notte.</i>
<i>- Buona notte.</i>

316
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Come in.

317
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,700
Who are you?

318
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,700
My name is Mike Hammer<i>,</i> if it matters.

319
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,200
What do you want?

320
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,900
l was with Christina
the night she was killed.

321
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,300
They tried to kill me too.
lf you like<i>,</i> l'll show you the scars.

322
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,900
- How'd you find me?
- Picked up a thread. Anybody could do it.

323
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,100
Mind if l sit down
while you're making up your mind?

324
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,200
Christina was my friend.

325
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,500
The bird in the cage<i>,</i> what happened to it?

326
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,900
lt was a nice bird.
Used to eat out of my hand.

327
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,000
You let it die. Why'd you let it die?

328
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,100
lt reminded me of her every time it sang.

329
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,100
She was a good kid.
She was lots of fun.

330
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,400
We worked together<i>,</i> couple of jobs...
Till she got sick.

331
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,700
That's when l noticed
that she started to change.

332
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:12,100
You get on a merry-go-round
and think you can get off any old time.

333
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,400
But then it starts going too fast.

334
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,800
She was scared.
She was more and more scared.

335
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,800
She was afraid to go out.

336
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:26,100
She'd go to the movies once in a while
or out for groceries<i>,</i> but never very far.

337
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Then the police came around.

338
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,800
They asked questions<i>,</i> lots of questions.

339
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,400
Then they took her away.

340
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,800
After a while<i>,</i> l had a feeling
someone was watching the place.

341
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,000
Then those men came.

342
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,300
What did they want?

343
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,600
l didn't stick around to find out.

344
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,600
Why was Christina so afraid?

345
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,300
lt's all right<i>,</i> you can trust me.

346
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
l don't know.

347
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,200
You wanna get even for what happened
to Christina<i>,</i> don't you?

348
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,800
l'll see what l can do.

349
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,600
<i>(train passes noisily by)</i>

350
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,100
<i>(chamber music )</i>

351
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
<i>(phone rings)</i>

352
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,000
<i>This is Crestview 5-4 1 24.</i>

353
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,500
<i>Mr Hammer, whom you are calling,</i>
<i>is not available at present.</i>

354
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:13,600
<i>lf you wish to leave a record of your call,</i>
<i>please state your message at the tone.</i>

355
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,800
<i>(man) Good evening, Mr Hammer.</i>

356
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,100
<i>You will wonder who this is,</i>
<i>but it does not matter.</i>

357
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:24,000
<i>What does matter is that your work</i>
<i>has been interrupted, your car wrecked.</i>

358
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,000
<i>Your life has been ruffled - to put it mildly.</i>

359
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,700
<i>lf you had not stopped</i>
<i>to pick up Christina,</i>

360
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,200
<i>not any of these things</i>
<i>would have happened.</i>

361
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,900
<i>So let's pretend you did not pick her up.</i>

362
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,700
- So what happens if l pretend?
- <i>Ah, so there you are, Mr Hammer.</i>

363
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,500
<i>Why, nothing will happen.</i>
<i>Your life will go on as serenely as before.</i>

364
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,300
<i>As a token of our intentions, look in front</i>
<i>of your apartment tomorrow morning.</i>

365
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,600
<i>(line goes dead)</i>

366
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,000
Ha-ha! That Mike.

367
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,600
He wrecks one car and goes out
and buys another one<i>,</i> just like that!

368
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,300
Wow. Va-va-voom!

369
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,300
Oh<i>,</i> some day l'm gonna get me
a car just like this.

370
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,700
l'm gonna get in and l'm gonna drive.

371
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,700
Oh<i>,</i> shines like a million.

372
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,100
Hey<i>,</i> even the keys are in.

373
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:51,000
Think l'll go around the block and come
back before he wakes up. Why not? Pow!

374
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,800
Nick!

375
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,200
- Don't touch anything.
- l didn't.

376
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,700
Turn that key and it's the last thing
you'll ever do. Open the hood.

377
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,000
Look under it.

378
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,300
- No<i>,</i> the other side.
- The other side.

379
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,700
Down around the starter.
See anything?

380
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,100
Yeah.

381
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,700
Disconnect it and take it out.

382
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,000
- ls this what you mean?
- Yeah. A torpedo.

383
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,500
- Turn the key and<i>,</i> boom<i>,</i> no more Nick.
- Wow.

384
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,400
- The hood.
- Oh<i>,</i> the hood.

385
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
Wow<i>,</i> that was close.

386
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,100
Boy. Oh<i>,</i> boy.

387
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,700
- Are you sure?
- Yeah<i>,</i> l'm sure.

388
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,600
- Are you really sure?
- l said l'm sure.

389
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,800
He's sure.

390
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,500
Pom-pom-porrr...

391
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,100
My moustache! My father's moustache!

392
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,700
Let's go to the freeway.
l wanna see how this bird flies.

393
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,700
- We better stop off at the garage first.
- Why?

394
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,500
- That's the one they expected us to find.
- There's another one?

395
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,900
- You sure?
- Yeah<i>,</i> l'm sure.

396
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,100
He's sure.

397
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,400
Find anything?

398
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,400
The sweet little kiss-off. lt's a bomb
connected to the speedometer.

399
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,200
Car goes slow<i>,</i> nothing happens<i>,</i>
but when you open her up wide...

400
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,600
Va-va-voom?

401
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,300
Hey<i>,</i> Nick.

402
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,900
How'd you like a rod like this one?

403
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,000
- Mine? All mine?
- Down to the last cotter pin.

404
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,700
What do l have to do?
Name it and it's done.

405
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,200
- Can you find out who souped her up?
- A cinch.

406
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,600
l know of a place in Culver City.
l'll dig around and ask a few questions.

407
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,700
- Va-va-voom?
- Va-va-voom.

408
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:20,100
Nicky<i>,</i> you should ask what it's worth
to him. What <i>he's</i> gonna get out of it.

409
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,200
Don't bother me<i>,</i> small fry.

410
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,500
You play your guitar<i>,</i> Sammy-boy<i>,</i>
and l'll drive my car.

411
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,200
Voom-voom pow!

412
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,100
Nicky<i>,</i> you're gonna get yourself
in a lot of trouble.

413
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,700
<i>(a waltz)</i>

414
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,400
<i>(music back on)</i>

415
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,300
- Did you call your friendly Mr Friendly?
- Yes. He awaits me anxiously.

416
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,200
Then call him back and cancel it.

417
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,900
Forget these penny-ante divorce cases.
l got a line on something better.

418
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,400
That girl was mixed up
in something big.

419
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:23,300
And a cut of something big...
could be something big.

420
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,200
l want you to find out
all you can about her.

421
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:31,300
First you find a little thread<i>,</i>
the little thread leads you to a string<i>,</i>

422
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,600
and the string leads you to a rope...

423
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,500
and from the rope you hang by the neck.

424
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:45,100
What kind of a girl was she<i>,</i>
this friend of yours<i>,</i> Christina?

425
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,200
l only ask because Ray Diker phoned up.

426
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,800
He left two names.

427
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,000
He said you might check up on them.

428
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,000
Where are they?

429
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,400
ln my typewriter.

430
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,100
Va-Va-Voom says that in Greek
your name would be Michali Sfiros.

431
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,500
But under any other name
would you be as sweet?

432
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,800
Kawolsky.

433
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,000
Kawolsky.

434
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:44,500
He was a professional fighter.
His first name was Lee.

435
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,000
Couldn't get anything on Raymondo.
Don't know what he was.

436
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,700
Why do you keep saying ''was''?

437
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,400
They both knew your Christina.
They both died the same way she did.

438
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,000
How was that?

439
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,900
The way you almost died.
Traffic... accident.

440
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,200
One fell out of a cab
and the other was run over by a truck.

441
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,300
Who's Carmen Trivago?

442
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,900
Carmen Trivago<i>,</i> a poor man's Caruso<i>,</i>

443
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,000
an unemployed opera singer
in search of an opera.

444
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,300
Raymondo's friend.

445
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,800
And who's Harvey Wallace?

446
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,400
He drove the truck
that ran over Kawolsky.

447
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,300
l was going down Washington Boulevard.
Where they're building that freeway?

448
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,900
lt was kinda late. l'd had a long day.

449
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,500
Winter. You know how it gets dark early.

450
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,500
l had my lights on.

451
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,900
l had 'em on. l know that.

452
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,400
Streets are jammed down there
around quittin' time.

453
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,200
This was after seven...
and the street's empty.

454
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:19,500
l was goin' under a bridge<i>,</i>
and <i>goin',</i> you know?

455
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,800
This guy come out of nowhere.

456
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,400
Did he step out or run out?

457
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,900
- Or maybe he was pushed.
- Yeah<i>,</i> pushed. More like he was pushed.

458
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,700
- Hello<i>,</i> Mike.
- Hi<i>,</i> Eddie.

459
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:15,900
How do you like my new boy? Kid Nino.
Doesn't he move pretty?

460
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,900
Sure - just like all your fighters<i>,</i> Eddie.

461
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:24,500
All right<i>,</i> Kid<i>,</i> shadow-box around.
l'm showing you off to a friend.

462
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,200
lsn't he beautiful? lsn't he lovely?
Look at the way he moves.

463
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,000
Sure<i>,</i> he's great.
But when he fights his big fight

464
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,700
he won't be able to punch
his way out of a paper bag.

465
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:37,300
- Why not<i>,</i> Mike?
- You'll sell him out<i>,</i> like all the others.

466
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,400
Not this one<i>,</i> Mike.

467
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,300
Wait until the odds build up<i>,</i>
until you can't resist.

468
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,700
No<i>,</i> Mike.

469
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
- When does he go?
- Tomorrow night. Main bout.

470
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,400
He's a winner<i>,</i> so it'll be short money.
Bet all you can. Bet your shirt.

471
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,000
lt'd pay more if he lost. You sure
he isn't gonna lay down and die?

472
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,900
On my word<i>,</i> Mike.

473
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,700
Now that's the kind of a bet l like.
Thanks a lot.

474
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,300
What l really came over for
was to find out what you know

475
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:10,500
about a kid that used to fight
under the name of Lee Kawolsky.

476
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,900
- What about him?
- Come on<i>,</i> don't give me that.

477
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,100
- You know just about everybody.
- About him l don't know.

478
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:23,300
He was killed in an accident<i>,</i>
but it wasn't really an accident.

479
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,200
Two fellas<i>,</i> they came in here.
Charlie Max and Sugar Smallhouse.

480
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:35,900
They asked<i>,</i> if anybody asked questions
about Lee Kawolsky<i>,</i> what do l know?

481
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,100
l looked at their faces.
You know what l said?

482
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,500
l said ''l don't know anything.''

483
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,500
They said to keep that in mind
and they'd make it worth my while.

484
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,700
You'd sell the gold
out of your mother's teeth.

485
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,000
- How much did they give you? l'll top it.
- You can't top this.

486
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,200
They said they'd let me breathe.

487
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:21,100
Hello. Pat Murphy<i>,</i> please.
Tell him Mike Hammer's calling.

488
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,900
Hello<i>,</i> Pat.

489
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,200
What do you know about a pair named
Charlie Max and Sugar Smallhouse?

490
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:32,900
Never mind what l know. All you have
to tell me is whose whistle they jump to.

491
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,600
Carl Evello?

492
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,700
- Yeah... Yeah...
- <i>(racetrack fanfare over radio)</i>

493
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,100
Go ahead. l can hear you.

494
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,500
Just a minute<i>,</i> l'll ask Mr Evello.

495
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,900
- What do you wanna do<i>,</i> Carl?
- We'll take half his action.

496
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:56,000
Carl says we'll take half. They out for
the fifth yet? We can get down a bet<i>,</i> huh?

497
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,200
- Would you give me a light<i>,</i> Sugar?
- Don't bother me.

498
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,900
Aw<i>,</i> come on<i>,</i> Sugar.

499
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,800
Give us a thousand on Big Boy<i>,</i>
on the nose.

500
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,400
Aren't you gonna
light my cigarette<i>,</i> Sugar?

501
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,500
Blow! Dames are worse than flies.
You playing cards<i>,</i> Charlie<i>,</i> or ain't you?

502
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,300
<i>(racing commentary from poolside)</i>

503
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,500
Hello.

504
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,000
Well<i>,</i> this is a coincidence.

505
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:35,700
- How do you do<i>,</i> ma'am?
- How do l do? Crazy.

506
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,300
Don't be afraid. l won't bite.

507
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,500
You don't taste like anybody l know.

508
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,800
But it's all right. ln fact<i>,</i> it's wonderful.

509
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,100
Come on<i>,</i> crazy.

510
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,400
- Seconds?
- OK.

511
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,200
Sure we haven't met before?

512
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,500
Never.

513
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,500
Who are you?

514
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,600
Who am l? Who are you?

515
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,700
l'm Friday. l'd have been named Tuesday
if l'd been born on Tuesday.

516
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,500
l'm Carl's sister. Half-sister.
Same mother<i>,</i> different father.

517
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,300
You know<i>,</i> you're not like the others.
Carl's friends<i>,</i> l mean.

518
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,800
Maybe because l'm not his friend.

519
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:37,300
Wonderful. Then you can be my friend.
All mine<i>,</i> nothing to do with Carl.

520
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,600
<i>(radio) There they go!</i>
<i>They come away from the gate...</i>

521
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,400
<i>(Friday)</i> They're big<i>,</i> hairy and ugly.

522
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,500
They chew long black cigars
and they talk loud.

523
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,900
l don't like them.

524
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,200
But l like you.

525
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,100
Then why don't you
invite me into the house?

526
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:01,100
- Will you come into my house?
- Why not?

527
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,300
What's that horse doin'<i>,</i> walkin'?
He ain't even in on the call.

528
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,600
Gin.

529
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,400
Gin? Gin?!

530
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,600
He don't pay no attention
and he kills me with his gin!

531
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,800
Here's to... friendship.

532
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,600
Friendship.

533
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,000
- l have lots of friends.
- l'll bet you have.

534
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,000
l'm not hard to get along with.
Really l'm not.

535
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,300
l can be a very... good friend.

536
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,000
Will you be my friend?

537
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,300
What do l have to do?

538
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,200
lf you wanna be a... close friend<i>,</i>
ask me something.

539
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,100
And no matter what it is<i>,</i>
the answer is yes<i>,</i> huh?

540
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,100
Maybe.

541
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,600
Let's see how good you are at spelling.
Can you spell ''no''?

542
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:59,700
N-o spells no.

543
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,800
That's a good girl.
Now you practise saying that.

544
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:07,800
Because one of the best ways
to be friendly is to know when to say no.

545
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,400
Your brother wouldn't be wearing
blue suede shoes by any chance?

546
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,100
Hardly. He's more
the black moccasin type.

547
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,600
You know<i>,</i> it's a hot day
and l'm feeling kind of warm.

548
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,100
Why don't you invite me for a dip?

549
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,100
Sure. Just get all wet.

Hey<i>,</i> look who's here.

00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,600
You'll find a suit inside. l'll wait.

553

- Why not?

Charlie<i>,</i> Sug.

555

Send him into the house.

How do <i>l</i> know what he knows?
All l know is he's snooping around.

l'll call you back.

560
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:11,600
Hello<i>,</i> Mr Hammer.
You handle yourself pretty well.

561
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,100
l figure it's good
to speak a lot of languages.

562
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,200
Any country you go to<i>,</i>
you can take care of yourself.

563
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,400
- Maybe you can speak my language<i>,</i> eh?
- Like putting torpedoes in gifts?

564
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,600
<i>(Evello chuckles)</i>

565
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,500
l'll admit that was a little crude.
We keep underestimating you.

566
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,100
l don't know what's on your mind.
What do you want<i>,</i> Mr Hammer?

567
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,900
Yesterday l was looking for a thread.
Today<i>,</i> a piece of string.

568
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,400
And tomorrow<i>,</i> who knows? You don't
even know what you're looking for.

569
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:48,000
- Tell me.
- Trouble. That's what you're looking for.

570
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,000
You're lucky. That drop off the cliff
didn't kill you<i>,</i> the torpedo should have.

571
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:59,900
Or Sugar. What'd you do to him<i>,</i> anyway?
You scared Charlie half to death.

572
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,100
Look<i>,</i> Mike. l like you.

573
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,100
l like the way you handle yourself.

574
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,600
You seem reasonable.
Why don't we make a deal?

575
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,100
What's it worth to you to turn your
considerable talents back to the gutter?

576
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,500
- Name a price.
- And you'll try it on for size<i>,</i> huh?

577
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,700
You're cute. You oughta know
better than anyone what it's worth.

578
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,600
l set my fee according to the case.
This one keeps getting higher.

579
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,400
lt does<i>,</i> huh?

580
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:31,500
Maybe you'd like to make an exploratory
offer just to get the ball rolling.

581
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:37,600
OK<i>,</i> Mr Hammer. lt's been nice talking
to you. Drop round again sometime.

582
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,500
Maybe then l'll have
a better notion of my fee.

583
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,200
lt's too late to set a fee<i>,</i> Mr Hammer.
Suddenly it's too late.

else. There are other guys around here.

Who invited you?

591

- Carmen Trivago. What room?
- Follow your ear.

592

00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,900
<i>Magnifico. Che bella voce. Bello, bello.</i>

596
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,100
<i>Bravo! Bravissimo!</i>

597
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,200
- Who are you?
- You're a friend of Nicholas Raymondo.

598
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,100
Raymondo?

599
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,600
- That's right. Raymondo.
- l know nothing. Nothing!

600
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,500
- Quite a stack of records you got here.
- Oh<i>,</i> yes.

601
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,700
- Caruso's <i>Pagliacci.</i>
- <i>ll maestro.</i>

602
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,500
- That's a collector's item.
- Yeah.

603
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,200
Please<i>,</i> what you wanted
to know? l will tell you.

604
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,800
Raymondo is my friend.
Very sad friend. Always he's sad.

605
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,000
He's - how you call? - engineer scientist.

606
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:46,100
Very smart. Very bright. Very sad.

607
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,500
He was murdered. Why?

608
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,900
l don't know. l don't know.

609
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:57,700
- What was he so sad about?
- For the way the world is<i>,</i> he is very sad.

610
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,900
He says to me...

611
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:05,900
''l'm very intelligent<i>,</i> Trivago<i>,</i>
but l'm very stupid.''

612
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,600
''l'm very rich<i>,</i> l'm very poor.''

613
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:14,800
''l have a little secret<i>,</i> and it's very
important. And it's not important at all.''

614
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,500
- What did he mean by that?
- When l ask him<i>,</i>

615
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:22,000
he says it's a riddle without an answer.

616
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:29,300
l think he's making a joke.
But when he's dead<i>,</i> l know it's not a joke.

617
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,800
Somewhere... somewhere he has a secret.

618
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,500
- How do you know that?
- They come<i>,</i> the ones that kill him.

619
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:45,400
They want something small. Something
he can hide where they don't find.

620
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,500
And they ask ''Where is it?!''

621
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:52,300
But l don't know. l don't know!

622
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:55,200
<i>(turns on ''Martha'' record)</i>

623
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,100
lt's a lovely record.

624
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,700
<i>(knocks)</i>

625
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,700
Mike?

626
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:39,100
They came last night<i>,</i> right after you left.
l heard them. l hid in the basement.

627
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,700
- They think you know something.
- But l don't.

628
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,200
- Tell <i>them</i> that.
- l've got to get out of here.

629
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,700
They found you once.
They'll find you again.

630
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:53,000
l'm going down to my car.
When you hear the horn<i>,</i> come running.

631
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,700
<i>(horn)</i>

632
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,800
<i>(singing)</i>

633
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,800
<i>(laughing)</i>

634
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,500
Mikey!

635
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,100
- Hi<i>,</i> Mikey.
- What happened?

636
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:45,400
l went to Culver City. They know nothing.
But they wanted to know why l asked.

637
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,200
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing.

638
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:54,000
Uh... Look<i>,</i> l've got to drop something off<i>,</i>
but l'll be back. We'll go together.

639
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,700
<i>(whistling cheerfully)</i>

640
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,200
<i>(Nick hums)</i>

641
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:18,200
Oh<i>,</i> hi. Anything l can do for you<i>,</i>
mister? l'm busy right now...

642
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,300
What are you doin' there?

643
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,600
<i>(screams)</i>

644
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:42,400
Use anything in the closet until we can
get you some clothes. Take the bedroom.

645
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,400
- Where will you sleep?
- l'll take the couch.

646
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,600
lf you want coffee<i>,</i> the kitchen's...

647
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,000
Thank you<i>,</i> Mike.

648
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,300
Thank you. Thank you.

649
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:11,000
OK<i>,</i> you've made your point.

650
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,200
You're welcome.

651
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,000
Mike?

652
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,100
Mike!

653
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,300
Why did you come back tonight?

654
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:25,200
<i>ln your absence, there have been no calls.</i>

655
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:30,900
You changed your mind. Something
changed it for you. What was it?

656
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:37,400
- You say you don't know a thing.
- lt's true. l don't.

657
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:44,500
But they think you do or they wouldn't be
after you. Maybe that's worth something.

658
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:50,500
Keep the door chained and don't answer
the phone. They won't know you're here.

659
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:55,900
But if they pay you off<i>,</i> you'll tell them.
Then where will l be?

660
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,200
Mike! You can't do that!

661
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,700
Mike?

662
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,400
Mike!

663
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,100
<i>(whimpering)</i> Nico<i>,</i> Nico...

664
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:50,700
Oh<i>,</i> Nick...

665
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,700
They kill Nick<i>,</i> Mike.

666
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,300
Somebody<i>,</i> they kill Nick.

667
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,500
<i>(sirens)</i>

668
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,600
<i>(whimpering)</i> No...

669
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,900
No<i>,</i> no<i>,</i> no...

670
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,700
Velda?

671
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,700
Velda?

672
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:53,300
Hello<i>,</i> Mike.

673
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,700
What is it?

674
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
What kind of trouble are you in this time?

675
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,300
Yes. Yes<i>,</i> you are. l can see it.

676
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,400
l'm glad.

677
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:17,400
l'm always glad when you're in trouble
because then you always come to me.

678
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,400
What is it<i>,</i> Mike?

679
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:23,600
Nick's dead.

680
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,400
Nick?

681
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:31,600
The jack slipped and
the car came down on him.

682
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,500
ls that what really happened?

683
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,800
He was doing a couple of jobs for me.

684
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,900
And he got it. Like all your friends
are gonna get it one of these days.

685
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,900
What is it you're after<i>,</i> Mike?

686
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,400
Something Nicholas Raymondo had
and the girl knew about.

687
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,600
Something very valuable.

688
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,700
But is it worth Nick's life?

689
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,500
Or Christina's<i>,</i> or Raymondo's<i>,</i>
or Kawolsky's?

690
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,900
Or mine?

691
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,400
<i>(Mike)</i> Or Lily Carver's?

692
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,100
Christina's roommate.

693
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:14,400
She's in my apartment.
They tried to get her last night.

694
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,500
<i>(Velda)</i> ''They.'' A wonderful word.
And who are they?

695
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:22,500
They are the nameless ones
who kill people for the great whatsit.

696
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,100
Does it exist? Who cares?

697
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:32,500
Everyone everywhere is so involved
in a fruitless search - for what?

698
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,800
Why don't you turn her over to Pat?
lt's his job to protect her.

699
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,400
lf she needs protection.

700
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,400
Or to question her if that's what's needed.

701
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,600
Why are you always trying
to make a noise like a cop?

702
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,900
- What were you doing in bed so early?
- l had a few drinks.

703
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,100
l'm trying to sleep off a hangover.

704
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,500
l met your friend Ray Diker
over at Toscio's this afternoon.

705
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:04,200
He pointed out some joker at the bar.
A dealer in abstract art or something.

706
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,800
l went over and
just happened to pick him up.

707
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,500
Make your ears stand up?

708
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:19,000
He dropped a few names.
Wanna hear them?

709
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,300
Carl Evello you know<i>,</i> but...

710
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,500
Dr Soberin. Does that
do anything for you?

711
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:33,000
This joker says there's a new art in the
world. This doctor's starting a collection.

712
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:36,000
What kind of a collection?

713
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,600
l don't know.

714
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:42,000
He... tried to date me.

715
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:48,600
With a few drinks
and one thing leading to another<i>,</i>

716
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:54,200
l suppose l could get some more
information about the doctor.

717
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:58,200
Do you want me to date him?

718
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,100
Well?

719
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:02,800
- Well what?
- Well<i>,</i> what do you think?

720
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:06,600
l think l'd like to get my hands
on whoever killed Nick.

721
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,900
You want to avenge the death
of your dear friend.

722
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,700
How touching. How sweet.

723
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:18,700
How nicely it justifies
your quest for the great whatsit.

724
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,500
Why don't you leave<i>,</i> Mike?

725
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,700
Before l change my mind.

726
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:36,600
Besides<i>,</i> l'm gonna need
all the rest l can get

727
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:42,900
if l'm gonna have any strength to
fight off my new-found<i>,</i> my bosom friend.

728
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,300
Mike...

729
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,100
Meet me at the Pigalle.

730
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,100
Two o'clock. Huh?

731
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,900
OK.

732
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:10,400
# The night is mighty chilly

733
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:18,400
# And conversation seems pretty silly

734
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:22,100
# l feel so mean and brought

735
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:29,600
# l'd rather have the blues
than what l've got

736
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:39,400
# The room is dark and gloomy

737
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:46,900
# You don't know what you're doing to me

738
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,500
# The web has got me caught

739
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:57,800
# l'd rather have the blues
than what l've got

740
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,000
<i>(singing continues)</i>

741
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:07,300
Say<i>,</i> man<i>,</i> you sure look beat.
You look real lean<i>,</i> real wasted.

742
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,400
You don't look like you're with it.

743
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,300
Give me a double bourbon<i>,</i>
and leave the bottle.

744
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,500
- Pour one for yourself.
- Sure. Any time.

745
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,700
Who we drinkin' to?

746
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
- Nick.
- Nick.

747
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:31,900
Va-va-voom. Pretty pow!

748
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:35,700
# Looks very frightening

749
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:41,000
# The rain begins<i>,</i> and then comes...

750
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,100
Mike. Mike!

751
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,200
Mike<i>,</i> come on.

752
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,400
A fella just come in.
Said they got your girl.

753
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,800
They got Velda. Told me to tell you.

754
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:09,000
- Where is he?
- l don't know. He cut out. He blew.

755
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,400
l'm sorry<i>,</i> Mike.

756
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,700
Thanks<i>,</i> kid.

757
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:59,100
- Jaguar not good enough for you<i>,</i> huh?
- The ashtrays were all full.

758
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,900
That girl l was with gave you a letter.
Know who it was addressed to?

759
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,800
Yeah. l just wanted to know
who the lucky guy was.

760
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,300
lt was some joker named Mike.

761
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,100
Mike?

762
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:47,400
lnteresting letter<i>,</i> huh?

763
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,700
Good evening<i>,</i> Mr Hammer.

764
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:54,500
We took a gander at it.
Couldn't quite make it out.

765
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:02,800
Won't be no trouble this time<i>,</i> Mr Hammer.
l've been taking lessons.

766
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:07,500
l was out for two hours after you
flipped me. Couldn't move a muscle.

767
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:12,000
- Give him a hand<i>,</i> Charlie.
- Yeah<i>,</i> sure.

768
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:16,200
Lean on me if you like<i>,</i> huh? Feel OK?

769
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,600
- Well<i>,</i> here we are<i>,</i> Mr Hammer.
- Watch your step.

770
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,800
For a couple of cannons<i>,</i>
you guys sure are polite.

771
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:50,300
We're here on this earth such a brief span<i>,</i>
we might as well be.

772
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,600
Well<i>,</i> you are awake.

773
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,700
Lie still. Why torment yourself?

774
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,600
Who do you see?
Someone you do not know.

775
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,700
A stranger.

776
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:05,800
What is it we are seeking?
Diamonds? Rubies? Gold?

777
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,800
Perhaps narcotics.

778
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,900
How civilised this earth used to be.

779
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:17,700
But as the world becomes more primitive<i>,</i>
its treasures become more fabulous.

780
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:22,000
Perhaps sentiment will succeed
where greed failed.

781
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:27,400
You will die<i>,</i> Mr Hammer.
But your friend<i>,</i> you can save her.

782
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,900
Yes<i>,</i> you can.

783
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:34,700
The young lady you picked up
on the highway<i>,</i> she wrote you a letter.

784
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,500
ln it were two words: ''Remember me.''

785
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:41,400
She asks you to remember.

786
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,700
What is it you must remember?

787
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:52,500
Do not be alarmed<i>,</i> Mr Hammer.
lt is only a harmless drug.

788
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,200
Sodium Pentothal. The truth serum.

789
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,200
Under its influence<i>,</i> you will sleep.

790
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:06,400
And while you sleep<i>,</i> your subconscious
will provide the answer<i>,</i>

791
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:11,700
and you will cry out
what it is that you must remember.

792
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,600
Pleasant dreams<i>,</i> Mr Hammer.

793
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,400

01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,900

01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:06,400
<i>(Mike moans)</i> No...

797

No!

799
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:14,300
''Remember me.'' What did she mean?

01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,700
Any luck?

<i>McCoy senses this may be the end.</i>

<i>lt's a left hook to Bender's jaw.</i>

808

<i>That was his third knockdown in the fight,</i>
<i>and we're only halfway through.</i>

809
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:11,000
<i>Bender has been taking a bad beating.</i>

810

<i>Bender tries frantically to get on</i>
<i>his bicycle but McCoy is in full chase.</i>

813
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,400
<i>He has Bender up against the ropes now...</i>

814
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,800
Back among the living<i>,</i> eh?

815
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,200

01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,900
- Yeah.
- OK<i>,</i> let's have it.

817
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:42,800
- Will you let her go?
- Sure. Take my word. Free as a bird.

818
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:45,100
You want to talk?

819
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,100
l want to whisper.

820
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,400

<i>who is a real tiger tonight, bent on the kill.</i>

826
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:23,500
<i>McCoy has shown too much experience</i>
<i>and punching power for Bender,</i>

827

<i>Now it's McCoy on the run and Bender</i>
<i>in pursuit. McCoy is in a neutral corner.</i>

- Yesterday.

01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:17,000
What did she mean<i>,</i> ''Remember me''?

852
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,300
Read this.

853
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,100
''Remember''?

01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:14,900
Mike! Don't leave me.

864
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:19,500
They were at the door last night.
They tried to get in.

865
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:23,000

Better get your coat.

''lf the darkness and corruption leave a

870
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:09,500
Something small<i>,</i>
something she could hide.

871
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:15,800
But where would she hide it?
She didn't have time at the gas station.

872
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:21,700
She swallowed it.
And if she swallowed it<i>,</i> you've got it.

Close the door<i>,</i> please.

No<i>,</i> that's all you get.

876

- l want it. Hand it over.

But whatever it is that's
locked away<i>,</i> l don't want it.

880
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:26,200
You have to find a fence and split the take.
That's too much trouble.

881

All l want is the cash<i>,</i>
right here in my hand.

01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:37,900
No more.

01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,600
This is it.

901
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,400
- lt's hot.
- Hot<i>,</i> sir?

902
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,600
Pardon me<i>,</i> sir. What is it?

903
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:53,000
l don't know<i>,</i> but keep away.
Don't let anybody near.

904
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,400
Yes<i>,</i> sir.

905
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:09,600
Carver?

906
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,100
Carver!

907
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:38,800
Yeah.

908
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:41,800
Yeah<i>,</i> but check that bar he goes to.

909
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,800
Check his girl's apartment
in case he comes around.

910
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:47,000
- <i>(door opens)</i>
- Just a minute.

911
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,900
lt's OK. He just came in.

912
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,700
- Where's the key?
- What key?

913
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,400
- That you took from Doc Kennedy.
- l don't know.

914
01:29:56,700 --> 01:30:00,700
- The key is very important. Hand it over.
- ls it as important as Velda?

915
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,200
lf you hadn't sent her out to do your dirty
work<i>,</i> she'd be OK. Now give me the key.

916
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:09,900
- Will you make a deal for her?
- Please<i>,</i> the key.

917
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:15,800
Sure<i>,</i> you'll make a deal for her.
Like you did for Christina.

918
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:20,700
You held her under custody in a hospital
and you let her get away and get killed.

919
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,900
The way Raymondo and Kawolsky were
killed. And Nick. And maybe Carver<i>,</i> too.

920
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:29,800
- Carver?
- Yeah. Surprised?

921
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,100
What kind of an investigation
are you running<i>,</i> anyway?

922
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,900
Lily Carver<i>,</i> Christina Bailey's roommate.

923
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:40,700
We fished Carver's body
out of the harbour over a week ago.

924
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,900
You're so bright<i>,</i> working on your own<i>,</i>
you penny-ante gumshoe.

925
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:48,300
You thought you saw something big
and you tried to horn in.

926
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:53,100
What about this dame
who's passing herself off as Carver?

927
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:10,100
How did you get that?

928
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,300
Now listen<i>,</i> Mike.

929
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,500
Listen carefully.

930
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,300
l'm going to pronounce a few words.
They're harmless words.

931
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:32,600
Just a bunch of letters
scrambled together.

932
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,800
But their meaning is very important.

933
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,200
Try to understand what they mean.

934
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:47,400
Manhattan Project. Los Alamos. Trinity.

935
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,200
Let's go.

936
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:20,600
- What about Velda?
- What about her?

937
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,800
- What about <i>him?</i>
- Let him go to hell.

938
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:32,400
Let the big slob sit there and think about
his girl<i>,</i> what's likely to happen to her.

939
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,800
l didn't know.

940
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,300
You didn't know.

941
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:48,300
Do you think you'd have done
any different if you <i>had</i> known?

942
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,500
<i>(dials phone)</i>

943
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

944
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,400
Diker?

945
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:10,300
Ray Diker!

946
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:12,100
The man you pointed out to Velda<i>,</i>
what's his name? What's his name?!

947
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:15,300
William Mist! His name is William Mist!

948
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,700
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

949
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,800
<i>(gagging and coughing)</i>

950
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:30,200
Where's Velda?

951
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:33,100
Where is she? Where is she?

952
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,700
Where is she? Where is she?

953
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,800
Where is she? Where is she?
Where is she?

954
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:50,600
<i>(snoring)</i>

955
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:10,500
<i>(</i># <i>classical music )</i>

956
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:47,500
<i>(Velda's voice) He pointed out</i>
<i>some joker at the bar.</i>

957
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:49,900
<i>A dealer in abstract art or something.</i>

958
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:54,100
<i>l went over and</i>
<i>just happened to pick him up.</i>

959
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:57,000
<i>He dropped a few names.</i>

960
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:59,400
<i>Does that make your ears stand up?</i>

961
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,600
<i>Wanna hear them?</i>

962
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:05,800
<i>Dr Soberin. Does that</i>
<i>do anything for you?</i>

963
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:10,800
<i>(louder) Dr Soberin.</i>
<i>Does that do anything for you?</i>

964
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:16,000
<i>Dr Soberin... Dr Soberin... Dr Soberin...</i>

965
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:27,500
- Dr Soberin's office.
- Dr Soberin<i>,</i> please.

966
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:30,900
l'm sorry. Dr Soberin
isn't available at present.

967
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:34,100
He's referring all his calls
to this answering service.

968
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:37,300
- Why not call another doctor?
- l need him. lt's important.

969
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:42,000
l can't help you. He might be at his
beach cottage<i>,</i> but there's no phone.

970
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,600
There is something sad
and melancholy about trips.

971
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
l always hate to go away.

972
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:54,800
But one has to find some new place<i>,</i>

973
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:58,600
or it would be impossible
to be sad and melancholy again.

974
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,600
<i>(Lily)</i> What's in the box?

975
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:08,000
- What's in the box?
- Curiosity killed a cat<i>,</i>

976
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:11,700
and it certainly would have <i>you</i>
if you'd opened it.

977
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:17,600
- You did well to call me when you did.
- Yes<i>,</i> l know. But what's in it?

978
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,800
You have been misnamed<i>,</i> Gabrielle.
You should have been called Pandora.

979
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:27,300
She was curious about a box and opened
it and let loose all the evil in the world.

980
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:31,100
Never mind about the evil. What's in it?

981
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:33,600
Did you ever hear of Lot's wife?

982
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:35,800
- No.
- No.

983
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:37,900
She was told not to look back.

984
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:42,500
But she disobeyed and
she was changed into a pillar of salt.

985
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:46,200
l just want to know what it is.

986
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:49,600
Would you believe me if l told you?
Would you be satisfied?

987
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:52,200
Maybe.

988
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:55,900
The head of the Medusa.
That's what's in the box.

989
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:59,400
And whoever looks on her
will be changed not into stone<i>,</i>

990
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,000
but into brimstone and ashes.

991
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:07,200
But you wouldn't believe me. You'd
have to see for yourself<i>,</i> wouldn't you?

992
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:08,900
Where are we going?

993
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:12,600
Where l am going
it is not possible for you to go.

994
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,600
l had no illusion about deceiving you.

995
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:20,500
You have the feline perceptions
that all women have.

996
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:25,700
Would you mind moving?
You're sitting on my coat.

997
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Whatever is in that box<i>,</i> it must be very
precious. So many people have died for it.

998
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,500
Yes<i>,</i> it is very precious.

999
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,700
l want half.

1000
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:40,600
l agree with you.
You should have at least half.

1001
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:46,200
You deserve it<i>,</i> for all the
creature comforts you've given me.

1002
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:53,400
But unfortunately the object
in this box cannot be divided.

1003
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:55,600
Then l'll take it all.

1004
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,600
- lf you don't mind.
- <i>(gunshot)</i>

1005
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:07,100
Gabrielle!

1006
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,300
Listen to me...

1007
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,500
as if l were Cerberus...

1008
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:22,300
barking with all his heads
at the gates of Hell.

1009
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:26,200
l will tell you where to take it.

1010
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:29,800
But don't...

1011
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
don't open...

1012
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,200
the box.

1013
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:02,300
- Hello<i>,</i> Mike.
- Where's Velda?

1014
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:07,200
Come in.

1015
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,100
Come in.

1016
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:22,500
Kiss me<i>,</i> Mike. l want you to kiss me.

1017
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:26,300
Kiss me.

1018
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:30,800
The liar's kiss that says ''l love you''

1019
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:33,100
but means something else.

1020
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:36,400
You're good at giving such kisses.

1021
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:40,600
Kiss me.
