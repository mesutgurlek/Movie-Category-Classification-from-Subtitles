1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,429
Careful, Oreste,
or the devil will take you away.

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,970
I am not afraid of the devil
because the devil is red!

3
00:00:06,971 --> 00:00:10,509
- Whose villa is this?
- Of Attila Melanchini.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,991
- He had fortune.
- Does he live there alone?

5
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:15,343
No, with his beloved Regina.

6
00:00:15,443 --> 00:00:16,995
They're the most envied
couple of the Bassa.

7
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:19,076
- Really?
- Yes.

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:27,229
Merry Christmas, Miss Regina.
Don't stay in the cold, come in!

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,270
Merry Christmas to her, Mrs. Pioppi.
We don't want to be late for the Mass.

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,858
Let's have a drink and then
we'll go to the church together.

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:45,710
She's crazy. First she ignores us in
public then she invites us to her house.

12
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:50,150
Maybe she wants to keep us
quiet. After all who cares?

13
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:52,345
<i>So? Are you coming in?</i>

14
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,990
Let's see how it is inside.

15
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,869
Merry Christmas, Mr. Federal.

16
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,147
- Are you making fun of me?
- One day you'll become one.

17
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,146
You're still so young! Young and strong!

18
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:41,149
Everything's artistic here. It's like
being in a foreign country, isn't it?

19
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,226
A perfect house for a true lady.

20
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,704
Very elegant, very refined,
full of culture.

21
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:59,638
You think? Please come
to see the living room.

22
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:16,876
- What is she doing?
- I told you she's crazy.

23
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,480
My God!

24
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:31,038
Now you will have to listen to me!

25
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:34,044
<i>Now it's me who speaks!</i>

26
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:38,885
<i>If you want to go out, you will have
to sign a paper that the house is mine.</i>

27
00:02:38,886 --> 00:02:39,884
Attila.

28
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:43,445
You got that mortgage
from my husband

29
00:02:43,446 --> 00:02:46,884
out of political blackmail and threats!

30
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:50,125
<i>You made his heart break.</i>

31
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:53,244
<i>You tormented him till he died.</i>

32
00:02:53,245 --> 00:02:56,325
<i>Everything's artistic like
in a foreign country, isn't it?</i>

33
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:59,404
<i>Exactly as you
would like it, Mr. Federal.</i>

34
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:03,365
<i>but now I'm holding you in a cage
and I won't let you go!</i>

35
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:08,004
You won't get out of here.
This house is mine and will remain mine.

36
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:10,885
<i>If nobody dares defend me,
I'll defend myself.</i>

37
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:12,682
"Made in Czechoslovakia".

38
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:19,845
Scandalous sinners!
Concubines! Concubines!

39
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:24,044
Did you hear?
She called us concubines.

40
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:28,925
If we don't get married soon,
we'll be on everyone's lips.

41
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:31,678
But the radio doesn't work.

42
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:38,483
You cannot hurt me anymore.

43
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:42,881
What did my kitten do to you?

44
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:48,801
Criminals. That's what
you are: criminals.

45
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:53,120
Assassins!
Damned assassins!

46
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:14,797
Murderous hogs. Murderous hogs!

47
00:04:15,845 --> 00:04:17,284
Hogs!

48
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:20,721
Mrs. Pioppi, stop it!

49
00:04:20,965 --> 00:04:24,878
Opens this door, enough
with this nonsense!

50
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:31,038
You're saying absurd things.
All stupid accusations.

51
00:04:31,965 --> 00:04:35,878
If you opened the door,
we could try to explain.

52
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:42,196
We are nice people.

53
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:55,045
I looked good with
the coalman's hat, didn't I?

54
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:58,142
Yes, you were irresistible, divine!

55
00:04:58,143 --> 00:05:01,238
However I prefer you with mine.

56
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:24,636
- There's so many people.
- Maybe they're returning from the Mass.

57
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:33,915
What happened?

58
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:39,524
<i>It wasn't for money,
she was full of debts.</i>

59
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:42,492
<i>Poor thing, with no more
house or land, all mortgaged.</i>

60
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,868
- By whom?
- By Berlinghieri, everybody knows.

61
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:50,045
My God!

62
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:58,005
- She had to mortgage for debts.
- What's the mortgage got to do with this?

63
00:05:58,006 --> 00:06:02,525
I think it was a sexual crime.
She was still an attractive woman.

64
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:05,437
Somehow she had
to take her fill, right?

65
00:06:07,205 --> 00:06:08,724
Merry Christmas.

66
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:10,795
- Miss.
- Commissioner.

67
00:06:23,845 --> 00:06:26,284
Which mortgage!

68
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:31,005
I wouldn't be surprised if it were
the crime of a crazy lover.

69
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:34,759
It can be anybody,
also one of the presents.

70
00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:40,597
Maybe she let him enter
and then she refused him.

71
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:47,237
He lost his head
and maybe raped her too

72
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:51,035
before killing her

73
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:56,203
Maniacs, communists, perverted.

74
00:06:57,965 --> 00:06:59,956
May I? Sorry.

75
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:07,084
She's got no underwear.

76
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:13,000
How come a woman goes around
without underwear? Why?

77
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:33,240
Ada! Ada!

78
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:49,159
Olmo! Olmo!

79
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,761
Olmo!

80
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:57,521
Olmo!

81
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:02,964
You lock the door now?
Why did you lock yourself inside?

82
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:07,163
- I don't, I lock the others outside.
- Where's my wife?

83
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:23,796
Enough! Get out!

84
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:28,959
- I am sorry.
- Out, Goddamit!

85
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:31,924
- What does he want?
- His wife!

86
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:33,130
Quiet, you'll wake up
the children.

87
00:08:34,086 --> 00:08:36,155
I'll go downstairs.

88
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:47,084
Sorry, I don't know
what's wrong with me.

89
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:50,645
I don't feel well, maybe
it's my heart, it went crazy.

90
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:53,443
Your heart?
You are sick in the head!

91
00:08:57,005 --> 00:09:00,044
Yes, you may be right.
Perhaps I am going crazy.

92
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:04,321
- Ada escaped and I don't know where she is.
- And you look for her in my bed?

93
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:06,924
Would it be strange?

94
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:08,992
- What do you mean?
- You know very well.

95
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:10,509
Come on, say it.

96
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:14,925
It's not such an impossible thing,
I know you like her.

97
00:09:14,926 --> 00:09:18,395
Yes, you are right.

98
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,400
She likes me too

99
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:30,194
and we make love all night.

100
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:34,003
But that's not enough for her.

101
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:40,600
She wants me... to insert
this salami up her ass!

102
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:46,924
You're a son of a bitch.
You make fun of me too.

103
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:52,795
I called for it, but if you knew what I am
going through, you would not speak like that.

104
00:09:57,405 --> 00:10:01,925
Poor widow Pioppi!
So much violence!

105
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:04,439
It's a horrible world!

106
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:12,084
And it had to happen tonight too.

107
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:16,636
Right when Ada and I
felt close to each other again.

108
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:20,524
When she saw all that blood
she ran away.

109
00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:24,325
As if it were my fault,
as if I was involved in it.

110
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:26,926
- Who'll take the house?
- What?

111
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,817
Villa Pioppi.

112
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:33,645
They'll put in jail a poor devil
who doesn't know anything.

113
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:36,478
They'll say he's a subversive.

114
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:39,444
Too many people died, Alfredo.

115
00:10:39,445 --> 00:10:45,445
but there will be more and more.
And too many people in jail.

116
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:48,642
And you allowed it,
you and those like you!

117
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:02,721
I am happy that you have a woman
in the house, it is good for your daughter.

118
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,043
She only came for Christmas.

119
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:12,321
Her husband is in jail.

120
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:19,801
Have you ever wondered why so many
of your friends are in jail and you aren't?

121
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:25,076
Because I stop Attila.
I protect you all the time.

122
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:30,164
If you protect me,
you'll have your own interest.

123
00:11:30,165 --> 00:11:33,345
Okay insult me.
Insult your old friend.

124
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:36,175
I protect you only
because I love you.

125
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:39,130
Remember when
we went fishing frogs?

126
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,085
It was beautiful to go
along the ditches in summer.

127
00:11:42,086 --> 00:11:44,440
I fished them and you ate them.

128
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:46,641
Come on.

129
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:51,602
The holes in your pockets. A Socialist
with holes in your pockets. Remember?

130
00:11:52,565 --> 00:11:55,762
Yes, I remember well.

131
00:11:56,965 --> 00:11:59,479
I remember your wedding.

132
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,685
I remember I was hit hard.

133
00:12:03,685 --> 00:12:06,119
And I remember
that you were there watching.

134
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:11,965
Do you also remember when
you stole the gun in my father's study?

135
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:14,962
If you have so much courage,
why don't you use it?

136
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:16,521
To get killed?

137
00:12:16,621 --> 00:12:19,005
Is that what you want?

138
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:27,473
Enough with talks, Alfredo.

139
00:12:32,005 --> 00:12:34,724
Go home, you'll see
that Ada is there.

140
00:12:36,445 --> 00:12:38,879
- Do you believe it?
- Yes.

141
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:49,124
Take this, you can never know.

142
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:55,284
Go to hell!

143
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:06,163
Ada!

144
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,400
Ada, open the door!

145
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:25,682
Ada, are you well?
Ada, answer me!

146
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:28,761
Ada!

147
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:33,921
Ada, what are you doing?

148
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:40,514
Ada, at least tell me something!

149
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:43,115
Do you feel bad?

150
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:48,114
What have I done
to you? Ada, open up.

151
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:51,605
I must ask you for something:
shall we take a trip?

152
00:14:51,606 --> 00:14:53,884
Shall we go to Paris?
We can leave tomorrow.

153
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:57,355
Or now if you want!
Let's have a child!

154
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:02,676
I have seen aunt Ada.

155
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:09,516
Come on Italo, come to eat.

156
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:20,085
<i>...the Italian-Germanic aviation
has brought an effective contribution</i>

157
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:24,565
<i>using bombs and
machine guns against</i>

158
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:28,325
<i>troops and vehicles.
During these fights...</i>

159
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:31,185
You have seen aunt Ada?

160
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:33,912
I have seen her.

161
00:15:33,913 --> 00:15:36,639
Don't talk nonsense.

162
00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:40,515
Ada is dead, dead, dead.

163
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:45,158
Perché are you saying she's dead?
She's in her room.

164
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,278
In a cage like a beast.

165
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,363
and she eats the hearts of bad children.

166
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:20,644
Look, fellow townsman,
this is the Fascist miracle!

167
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:23,965
The miracle is to turn draught
horses into steam horses!

168
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:27,162
Did you hear?
You're no longer needed.

169
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:32,201
Hey, Baroni.

170
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:37,515
if you buy the horses,
also buy the horse-seller.

171
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:40,635
I am speaking of you, Olmo!

172
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,878
He seems strong,
does he have family?

173
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:52,436
He's a widower, with a child.

174
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:02,444
It depends on the price.

175
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:05,517
Baroni, you've never
made such a bargain!

176
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:15,517
Baroni it is a gentleman,
it couldn't go better.

177
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:22,521
Then I am sold.

178
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:28,795
You're part of the contract.
Horses, horse-seller and shit included!

179
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:31,361
Did you hear? He sold me!

180
00:17:33,365 --> 00:17:36,965
He sold me! Like a beast!

181
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:47,435
But I don't make milk,
I can't be milked.

182
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:51,837
I don't eat hay,
then I am not a beast!

183
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:59,318
I'm a peasant! A peasant like you.

184
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:07,924
Can they sell us?
Can they buy us?

185
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,400
Do you think it's right?

186
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,124
I wonder if it is.

187
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:25,721
Olmo, take the horses and your daughter
and go with Baroni, he bought you.

188
00:18:29,245 --> 00:18:31,520
Shit included, then!

189
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,525
Shit included!

190
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:55,360
Shit, dam it, shit!

191
00:18:55,361 --> 00:18:58,435
Shit! Shit! Shit a lot!

192
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:08,244
May God be praised! He shitted!

193
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:12,079
See how much of it he made!

194
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:23,394
The restocking!

195
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:35,281
Comrades!

196
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:40,285
Laugh! Today
everything can change!

197
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:42,241
Baroni!

198
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:47,719
Make him eat it,
today is carnival!

199
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:50,084
"Milk and wine, subtle poison".

200
00:19:50,085 --> 00:19:54,125
Tell your owner, if she drinks
milk, she'll remain young!

201
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,081
Idiot.

202
00:19:57,925 --> 00:19:59,881
Hi, Federica.

203
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:03,239
- What happened?
- I don't know.

204
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:14,285
- Hurry up, boy!
- Quick! They're arriving!

205
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:16,719
- Hurry up, leave.
- Yes.

206
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:24,025
- Can I come with you?
- No, go to Stella.

207
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:27,005
- Please, take me with you.
- Be good.

208
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:29,235
Here's the key.

209
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:32,781
- I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

210
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:34,635
I'll be back soon.

211
00:20:41,085 --> 00:20:43,997
You'll do fine with Stella!

212
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:50,090
Take this, you'll need it
more than me.

213
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,314
Thanks.

214
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:57,358
Lock up the house,
don't go around alone.

215
00:20:58,245 --> 00:20:59,997
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

216
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:03,724
- Good luck, Olmo.
- Thanks.

217
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:09,277
- Take care..
- Write to us, let us know how you are.

218
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:12,742
- Take this, Olmo.
- See you soon!

219
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:15,320
- Good trip.
- Cover yourself!

220
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:49,885
Mrs., today I have something
new to tell you. A true story!

221
00:21:49,886 --> 00:21:52,353
Wait. Wait.

222
00:22:02,725 --> 00:22:05,313
Attila wanted to sell Olmo.

223
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:07,202
- Sell him?
- Yes.

224
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:12,605
He bought a new tractor and Olmo
and the horses aren't needed anymore.

225
00:22:12,606 --> 00:22:14,644
So he wanted
to sell them to a merchant.

226
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:17,885
- Nobody helped Olmo?
- Yes, all did!

227
00:22:17,886 --> 00:22:20,319
Everybody! All!

228
00:22:22,205 --> 00:22:24,764
Then it started snowing!

229
00:22:24,765 --> 00:22:28,125
- What?
- Yes, to snow shit!

230
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:31,484
So much shit on Attila!

231
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:34,684
In his eyes, in his mouth, on his bald head!

232
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:38,245
- Nothing on Regina?
- No, because she wasn't there, otherwise...

233
00:22:38,246 --> 00:22:42,205
Anche the horses helped too!
They kept shitting!

234
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:44,484
They even made him a mask of shit!

235
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:49,434
Then the farmers got scared
and Olmo had to escape.

236
00:22:51,365 --> 00:22:52,800
Olmo escaped?

237
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,923
Yes, because Attila
will return to take revenge.

238
00:22:56,023 --> 00:22:57,920
Everybody cried.

239
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,535
But was he happy?
Did you see if he was happy?

240
00:23:00,635 --> 00:23:03,800
- Not, really...
- You are a fool, you are blind!

241
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:10,442
Poor Olmo had to leave
the house and his daughter.

242
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:13,035
He wasn't happy.

243
00:23:15,285 --> 00:23:17,444
What can you know of these things...

244
00:23:17,445 --> 00:23:21,005
- Are you leaving too, madam?
- Yes, I'm going away and I'm happy.

245
00:23:21,006 --> 00:23:23,075
Everyone's leaving.

246
00:23:28,485 --> 00:23:31,841
I don't need them anymore.
I give you all.

247
00:23:46,085 --> 00:23:48,315
Also this. You also take this.

248
00:23:52,205 --> 00:23:53,558
And this.

249
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:56,518
This.

250
00:23:56,845 --> 00:23:58,119
This.

251
00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:01,476
And also this.

252
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:07,761
Mrs.,

253
00:24:09,685 --> 00:24:12,324
would you give me a kiss too?

254
00:24:13,205 --> 00:24:14,957
Come here.

255
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,123
Attila!

256
00:25:25,805 --> 00:25:27,363
Attila!

257
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:38,075
Get down at once!

258
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:45,957
- It's full of fliers in the other room.
- I'll take care of it.

259
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:54,523
Attila!

260
00:25:56,045 --> 00:25:59,925
He escaped, but in a couple
of hours we'll have taken him back.

261
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:02,044
Who gives you the right
to break everything?

262
00:26:02,045 --> 00:26:05,525
- That is a communist, a subversive!
- He's a friend of mine!

263
00:26:05,526 --> 00:26:09,725
Nice friend! He stole
your father's gun!

264
00:26:09,726 --> 00:26:12,844
It took you long to find it!

265
00:26:12,845 --> 00:26:16,605
So you knew! Why didn't you...

266
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:20,365
Your services
are no more necessary.

267
00:26:20,366 --> 00:26:21,923
What?

268
00:26:23,885 --> 00:26:28,485
I have dismissed him! Did you hear me?
I have dismissed the farmer!

269
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:31,716
I sent away Attila!
Attila will go away!

270
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:41,804
Ada! I know I shouldn't come here,

271
00:26:41,805 --> 00:26:45,005
but today an important
thing happened.

272
00:26:45,006 --> 00:26:47,883
I wish I did it before, but...

273
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:56,244
I made it, I dismissed
Attila. It's over.

274
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:04,237
- The lady has left.
- Left?

275
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:07,554
- Where did she go?
- Madam won't return.

276
00:27:07,654 --> 00:27:10,623
- Where did she go?
- She won't return.

277
00:27:10,723 --> 00:27:12,409
Answer!

278
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:22,034
She said: "Put on that dress,
he will understand".

279
00:27:39,765 --> 00:27:41,721
Drink!

280
00:27:42,885 --> 00:27:47,879
See, that's how you
all will end up, like mice!

281
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:07,259
Orialò!

282
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,803
<i>Piso! Piso!</i>

283
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:23,645
Do you like them pig? Repugnant Fascist!

284
00:28:23,646 --> 00:28:26,885
- Shameless cow, cover up yourself!
- Hog!

285
00:28:26,886 --> 00:28:28,605
Whore!

286
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:36,122
Don't move or I'll shoot you!

287
00:28:40,445 --> 00:28:43,284
- Demezio!
- Yes?

288
00:28:43,285 --> 00:28:46,404
- God exists?
- No!

289
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:51,160
Attila, does that pig
of Mussolini exist?

290
00:28:51,645 --> 00:28:54,665
Demezio, does
the Duce exist?

291
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:57,685
No, he doesn't exist!

292
00:28:57,686 --> 00:28:59,325
Shoot him.

293
00:29:03,005 --> 00:29:07,565
Attila! You don't exist too!

294
00:29:50,485 --> 00:29:54,685
You all want to die?
But you cannot fool me!

295
00:29:54,686 --> 00:29:56,835
Mapponi! Baroni!

296
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:01,595
Come away. Peasants!

297
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:08,243
Miserable! You are
the shame of Italy!

298
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:16,960
You are the shit of Italy!

299
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:38,733
25th APRIL 1945 - DAY OF THE LIBERATION

300
00:30:48,525 --> 00:30:51,758
Boys, run! Come here!

301
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:57,801
We must kill all the black brigands!

302
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,485
Careful, don't let them kill you!

303
00:31:13,486 --> 00:31:16,283
Shoot the Fascist in the ass!

304
00:31:27,405 --> 00:31:33,205
Anita! Anita! What do you see?

305
00:31:33,206 --> 00:31:35,161
What do I see?

306
00:31:35,765 --> 00:31:37,604
A lot of things.

307
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:40,845
I see many black brigands
who escape like rabbits

308
00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:44,820
and one of ours runs
behind them without rifle.

309
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:48,795
Anita! It has to be
my Tigre, God bless him!

310
00:31:51,685 --> 00:31:55,524
He has only a baton in his hand!
How strong he is!

311
00:31:55,525 --> 00:31:59,645
He seems a devil with a hundred arms
from the strokes he's giving him!

312
00:31:59,646 --> 00:32:01,681
if you saw him, women!

313
00:32:01,885 --> 00:32:08,085
- Beat them Tiger! Kill them!
- And don't we do anything?

314
00:32:08,086 --> 00:32:12,205
Scream, women!
Scream, make yourselves heard!

315
00:32:12,206 --> 00:32:14,161
Louder! Louder!

316
00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:23,994
Blessed youth who
sees what is not there.

317
00:32:24,165 --> 00:32:26,724
The German armies
are running away!

318
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:30,124
They're leaving forever,
they'll never return!

319
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:35,802
They're throwing away rifles and uniforms
not to make themselves recognized!

320
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:38,794
Women, the things I see!

321
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:40,684
What?

322
00:32:40,685 --> 00:32:45,918
I see a big dust cloud
and a man on a white horse.

323
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,678
He seems Olmo.

324
00:32:50,045 --> 00:32:53,640
If Olmo were here!

325
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:55,517
Leave the dead alone.

326
00:32:59,285 --> 00:33:01,799
Attila and Regina.

327
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:05,834
Attila and Regina!

328
00:33:16,045 --> 00:33:18,001
Attila, shoot!

329
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:30,245
# Pilgrim who come from Rome
wearing broken shoes.

330
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:33,725
# As soon as you had
arrived at the inn... #

331
00:34:00,765 --> 00:34:03,925
Shitty fatty!

332
00:34:23,165 --> 00:34:27,477
Fascist cow! Fascist cow!

333
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:34,078
Away, women! Let's take
them to the pigsty!

334
00:34:57,205 --> 00:34:59,958
<i>No trespassing,
you cannot pass!</i>

335
00:35:00,605 --> 00:35:05,765
- Let us pass!
- We want to be there too!

336
00:35:05,766 --> 00:35:07,721
Leave them to us!

337
00:35:10,925 --> 00:35:15,874
Comrades, is it true that you're giving
the land to those who work it?

338
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:20,764
I said

339
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:23,962
is it true that you're giving
the land to those who work it?

340
00:35:25,325 --> 00:35:27,714
Yes, is true! Come!

341
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:33,884
Come on.

342
00:35:35,965 --> 00:35:37,921
How many people!

343
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:43,085
Who are you who say
what we all have in our hearts?

344
00:35:43,086 --> 00:35:47,205
He is Cornelio and
I'm Rondine, his wife.

345
00:35:47,206 --> 00:35:49,364
We come from the mountains.

346
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:52,525
The Germans burnt our houses

347
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:55,684
and the Fascist
robbed us of everything.

348
00:35:55,685 --> 00:35:59,005
First of all we have
to give them a place to sleep.

349
00:35:59,006 --> 00:36:01,524
The stable will do for us.

350
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:04,005
No, the stable
is for the vagabond!

351
00:36:04,006 --> 00:36:06,485
Houses are for Christians!

352
00:36:06,486 --> 00:36:08,965
And rifles are for the Fascist.

353
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:27,725
# I'm happy to die, but I am sorry.

354
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:33,085
# I'm sorry to die, but I'm happy.

355
00:36:33,086 --> 00:36:34,324
# I'm happy... #

356
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,361
Stop it, idiot!

357
00:36:37,605 --> 00:36:39,561
Who's that?

358
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:42,877
Popular committee
for pig's sharing.

359
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,634
How much nice stuff!

360
00:36:52,365 --> 00:36:55,405
- How beautiful you are!
- Have you found a wife?

361
00:36:55,406 --> 00:36:57,244
Want to marry the sow?

362
00:36:57,245 --> 00:37:00,004
Don't escape as well,
unfaithful one!

363
00:37:00,005 --> 00:37:02,605
<i>Hands off, first
we have to count them!</i>

364
00:37:02,606 --> 00:37:06,204
My love! My love!

365
00:37:06,205 --> 00:37:10,524
You're pitiless! Bastards! Bastards!

366
00:37:10,525 --> 00:37:18,325
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
There are 20 of them!

367
00:37:18,326 --> 00:37:21,484
Just a moment, comrades,
I have a lump in my throat.

368
00:37:21,485 --> 00:37:26,005
We have to abolish the estate
to make the lump disappear!

369
00:37:26,006 --> 00:37:30,725
We are really stupid,
we haven't understood anything!

370
00:37:30,726 --> 00:37:35,445
This herd of hams, salamis, cotechini,

371
00:37:35,446 --> 00:37:37,964
and mortadella, belongs to everyone?

372
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:42,685
The beasts belong to everybody.
Socialism is not for everybody instead.

373
00:37:42,686 --> 00:37:46,425
I don't know anything of socialism,
I only know of hunger.

374
00:37:46,426 --> 00:37:50,165
And I feel sorry for those two.

375
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:52,918
<i>All the D'Alcòs, come here.</i>

376
00:37:54,645 --> 00:37:59,305
you that come from the mountains
full of priests to bring us ignorance,

377
00:37:59,306 --> 00:38:03,965
punch yourself on the head
and let the socialist idea in.

378
00:38:03,966 --> 00:38:07,804
- What shall we do?
- You heard him.

379
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:11,005
<i>He speaks well, but he told us
to punch ourselves on the head!</i>

380
00:38:11,006 --> 00:38:13,360
<i>Punches on the head hurt.</i>

381
00:38:13,605 --> 00:38:17,484
Look at him. Look at him well.

382
00:38:17,485 --> 00:38:22,284
I know that you are
a good man, have pity.

383
00:38:22,285 --> 00:38:27,325
He's dying as a pig.
Help him in the name of humanity.

384
00:38:27,326 --> 00:38:30,078
In the name of socialism.

385
00:38:56,605 --> 00:39:00,439
Look, my grandfather
is buried here.

386
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:15,917
"Patrizio Vanzini.

387
00:39:16,045 --> 00:39:22,725
tender flower chopped off
by the cruel hand of destiny".

388
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:28,994
The cruel hand of destiny!
The hand of destiny!

389
00:39:30,445 --> 00:39:33,084
The cruel hand...

390
00:39:37,045 --> 00:39:40,355
Regina, our children...

391
00:39:40,485 --> 00:39:44,525
our children will pick up
what we have sowed.

392
00:39:44,526 --> 00:39:47,084
- You're crazy!
- Go away!

393
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:51,203
They cut your hair! Not the hair!

394
00:39:57,565 --> 00:40:01,763
"lda Cantarelli, widow Pioppi.

395
00:40:02,925 --> 00:40:08,561
good and holy woman offended
by the ferocity of the times".

396
00:40:08,562 --> 00:40:14,198
I'm this fierce log!
I have killed that sow.

397
00:40:14,405 --> 00:40:19,957
And I enjoyed Patrizio Vanzini!

398
00:40:20,205 --> 00:40:23,402
Me, Attila Melanchini.

399
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:26,481
Fascist.

400
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:28,841
Man.

401
00:40:29,605 --> 00:40:33,280
Beasts, servants.

402
00:40:34,645 --> 00:40:36,601
Disgust.

403
00:40:37,085 --> 00:40:39,041
Shit.

404
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:46,805
Enough with the music,
this is not a dance-hall!

405
00:40:46,806 --> 00:40:49,922
You don't have
respect for the dead?

406
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:28,004
Come here.

407
00:41:28,005 --> 00:41:31,156
Run. Everyone!

408
00:41:34,445 --> 00:41:36,481
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

409
00:41:38,005 --> 00:41:39,757
Kill me!

410
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:42,521
Kill me.

411
00:41:45,245 --> 00:41:48,920
Kill me! Kill me!

412
00:42:16,045 --> 00:42:18,036
Come away, be careful!

413
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:35,844
What are you looking at, stupid!

414
00:42:45,045 --> 00:42:47,005
Halt, no trespassing.

415
00:42:47,006 --> 00:42:48,961
Stop it!

416
00:42:52,205 --> 00:42:54,964
- Who is it?
- The master, he's my prisoner.

417
00:42:54,965 --> 00:42:58,514
- Why are you hiding him?
- I'm waiting for the partisans.

418
00:43:00,725 --> 00:43:03,603
You look good with that rifle.

419
00:43:51,285 --> 00:43:53,823
<i>Come on Maria, you can win!</i>

420
00:43:53,824 --> 00:43:56,361
<i>Don't fall off the ladder!</i>

421
00:44:03,805 --> 00:44:06,684
Wait! My goose!

422
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:09,764
This is mine and
no one can touch it!

423
00:44:09,765 --> 00:44:14,165
- If is yours, it's everyone's!
- Why mine has to be everyone's?

424
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:17,237
<i>Make it redder,
it brings good luck!</i>

425
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,961
Stop it.

426
00:44:38,405 --> 00:44:40,202
Stupid.

427
00:44:41,005 --> 00:44:42,563
Stop it.

428
00:44:50,165 --> 00:44:53,123
The master!
Where was him?

429
00:44:53,685 --> 00:44:58,325
- We forgot to arrest him.
- Good, Leonida!

430
00:44:58,326 --> 00:45:01,522
Young people
are better than the old!

431
00:45:20,605 --> 00:45:24,723
Sorry Master,
it slipped out of my hand!

432
00:45:28,965 --> 00:45:32,037
And that slipped out of my foot!

433
00:45:34,045 --> 00:45:38,125
Olmo, here's my prisoner.

434
00:45:38,126 --> 00:45:39,478
Good.

435
00:45:47,285 --> 00:45:49,594
Hey. Are you sleeping?

436
00:45:55,445 --> 00:45:57,401
Ada never returned.

437
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:04,684
- Would you prefer that she were dead?
- At least you returned.

438
00:46:26,365 --> 00:46:28,196
Are you sure that it's here?

439
00:46:34,085 --> 00:46:40,285
I officially start the popular
trial against Alfredo Berlinghieri,

440
00:46:40,286 --> 00:46:42,719
a master and therefore
an enemy to the people.

441
00:46:45,725 --> 00:46:50,355
I officially declare that the popular
trial against the master is open!

442
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:16,638
I knew it was here.

443
00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:38,445
I declare that the popular trial
against Alfredo Berlinghieri,

444
00:47:38,446 --> 00:47:41,835
a master and therefore an enemy
to the people is open.

445
00:47:42,725 --> 00:47:47,162
I want to see it!

446
00:47:55,565 --> 00:47:56,733
Ada?

447
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:59,335
She isn't here, otherwise
she would have been tried like you.

448
00:47:59,435 --> 00:48:01,764
She left on the same day
when you escaped.

449
00:48:01,765 --> 00:48:06,441
She's smarter than you.
You remained a master till the end.

450
00:48:11,245 --> 00:48:14,324
- What are you writing, Anita?
- We're not at school.

451
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:17,601
Anita, this is a popular trial,
what do you want to write?

452
00:48:18,085 --> 00:48:22,125
Comrades, all that we'll do
to him must be written.

453
00:48:22,126 --> 00:48:25,404
All that is written
must be read!

454
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:29,284
- It was kept hidden for so long!
- Our flag!

455
00:48:29,285 --> 00:48:33,045
- All of our flags!
- Long live the labourers' flag!

456
00:48:33,046 --> 00:48:36,805
I have sewn it with Rosina
it's grown year by year!

457
00:48:36,806 --> 00:48:38,804
Olmo, we are ignorant

458
00:48:38,805 --> 00:48:41,644
but how can we make
a trial without lawyers?

459
00:48:41,645 --> 00:48:45,765
I bring you a guilty man, and you want
the lawyers! What do you want?

460
00:48:45,766 --> 00:48:48,916
We arrested the master, not you!

461
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:53,485
That's not true! Leonida
arrested him with his rifle!

462
00:48:53,486 --> 00:48:55,441
Yes!

463
00:49:57,125 --> 00:50:00,037
Come on, dance!

464
00:50:14,485 --> 00:50:18,365
When mutes start speaking,
they want to say many things,

465
00:50:18,366 --> 00:50:20,401
but their tongues are tied up.

466
00:50:21,365 --> 00:50:24,675
If your tongue is tied up,
speak with your heart, granny.

467
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,121
Enough with music.

468
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:45,638
I lost them working for you,
who will return them to me?

469
00:50:58,565 --> 00:51:00,764
See how many teeth I miss!

470
00:51:00,765 --> 00:51:05,165
He has teeth and keeps
chewing every day!

471
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:07,121
Munch munch! Munch munch!

472
00:51:16,965 --> 00:51:19,844
- You're clean, We're dirty!
- All to you and nothing to us!

473
00:51:19,845 --> 00:51:22,996
- You at rest, us at work.
- You to eat and us to starve!

474
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:30,115
You are a criminal,

475
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:32,459
- but your grandfather was even worse!
- It's true!

476
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,165
There was a storm and he wanted
to dismiss all the labourers!

477
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:37,404
No, it was his father Giovanni!

478
00:51:37,405 --> 00:51:40,602
Father or son, the master
is always the master!

479
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:52,205
Peasants are needed,
otherwise the land doesn't yield.

480
00:51:52,206 --> 00:51:55,356
But what's a master for?

481
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:07,284
I can only say I have
never hurt anyone.

482
00:52:07,285 --> 00:52:11,483
- Never hurt anyone.
- Now all the masters say that.

483
00:52:12,885 --> 00:52:15,135
They are so hypocritical that
they almost believe it.

484
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:16,912
I have never hurt anyone.

485
00:52:17,766 --> 00:52:20,364
That's why you released many criminals

486
00:52:20,365 --> 00:52:24,278
and imprisoned the communists?
Comrades, that's the truth.

487
00:52:26,645 --> 00:52:33,039
The Fascist are not like mushrooms
which are born in a night. No!

488
00:52:33,245 --> 00:52:35,325
Masters planted the Fascist,

489
00:52:35,326 --> 00:52:38,078
they wanted them,
they paid for them.

490
00:52:38,565 --> 00:52:41,325
With the Fascist masters
earned more and more,

491
00:52:41,326 --> 00:52:44,125
till they didn't know
where to put the money!

492
00:52:44,126 --> 00:52:46,364
So they invented the war.

493
00:52:46,365 --> 00:52:50,165
They sent us to Africa, Russia, Greece,

494
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:53,964
Albania, Spain...
But we're those who pay!

495
00:52:53,965 --> 00:52:57,565
The proletariat, the workers,
the peasants, the poor keep paying!

496
00:53:05,045 --> 00:53:09,800
Alfredo Berlinghieri,
hear the voice of the people?

497
00:53:10,685 --> 00:53:15,365
We're the scoundrels,
we're penniless,

498
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:19,805
but we dare condemn you to death

499
00:53:19,806 --> 00:53:22,160
and with us the
whole past condemns you.

500
00:53:22,845 --> 00:53:26,554
Be happy, comrades,
the master is dead!

501
00:53:28,365 --> 00:53:30,799
The master doesn't exist anymore!

502
00:53:32,445 --> 00:53:35,243
I am very tired,
can I sit down?

503
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:45,721
I am very tired.

504
00:53:48,205 --> 00:53:51,564
If I understood well,
he's already dead.

505
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:55,478
He believes to be alive,
but we know that he is dead!

506
00:54:02,525 --> 00:54:06,925
He's alive, the dead
are cold, he's warm!

507
00:54:06,926 --> 00:54:10,713
Olmo, you learned
to speak well. Here!

508
00:54:12,045 --> 00:54:16,880
But I don't understand
your words, they sound tricky.

509
00:54:17,805 --> 00:54:21,845
The master is dead,
but Alfredo Berlinghieri is alive

510
00:54:21,846 --> 00:54:24,964
- and we don't have to kill him.
- Why?

511
00:54:24,965 --> 00:54:28,753
Because he is the living proof
that the master is dead.

512
00:54:43,525 --> 00:54:46,437
Now let's vote. If you
agree raise your hand.

513
00:56:37,816 --> 00:56:40,477
Comrades! Here come the partisans!

514
00:57:25,765 --> 00:57:27,721
Quiet!

515
00:57:33,285 --> 00:57:39,325
We're here in representation
of the committee of national liberation.

516
00:57:39,326 --> 00:57:42,665
We represent the Christian Democrats,
we represent the liberals,

517
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:46,005
we represent the socialists,
we represent the communists,

518
00:57:46,006 --> 00:57:48,204
we represent the party of action.

519
00:57:48,205 --> 00:57:52,205
The committee of national
liberation has taken the power,

520
00:57:52,206 --> 00:57:55,685
above all as regards public order.

521
00:57:55,686 --> 00:57:58,865
Dear friends, just
stick to the decision

522
00:57:58,866 --> 00:58:02,045
of the committee of liberation
and to deposit your weapons.

523
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:04,923
- No!
- These are the orders.

524
00:58:06,725 --> 00:58:09,484
- Comrades, victory is like to get drunk.
- No!

525
00:58:09,485 --> 00:58:12,765
Yes, when you're drunk, you say
the things you have in your heart,

526
00:58:12,766 --> 00:58:15,044
the most hidden truths.

527
00:58:15,045 --> 00:58:19,605
Then someone always comes
to throw cold water at your face.

528
00:58:19,606 --> 00:58:22,845
and shout: "wake up, wake up! "

529
00:58:22,846 --> 00:58:24,404
Yes!

530
00:58:24,405 --> 00:58:27,044
Let me speak!

531
00:58:27,965 --> 00:58:33,517
Alright! Tomorrow we'll be
told that we're dreamers!

532
00:58:34,325 --> 00:58:37,644
But even if the facts will want us
to believe that the master is alive,

533
00:58:37,645 --> 00:58:42,805
we don't have to believe it.
Because us we've seen it with our eyes!

534
00:58:42,806 --> 00:58:44,955
The master it is dead!

535
00:59:24,285 --> 00:59:28,756
- Child, don't you deliver your weapon?
- The rifle is mine, give it back to me!

536
01:00:42,925 --> 01:00:44,881
The master is alive.

537
01:02:26,565 --> 01:02:34,438
# The hunter in the wood
saw a country girl

538
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:42,557
# who was beautiful.
Lovely and attractive.

539
01:02:43,965 --> 01:02:49,961
# The hunter fell in love.

540
01:02:50,325 --> 01:02:57,913
# as she was beautiful.
Lovely and attractive.

541
01:02:58,445 --> 01:03:04,122
# The hunter fell in love. #
