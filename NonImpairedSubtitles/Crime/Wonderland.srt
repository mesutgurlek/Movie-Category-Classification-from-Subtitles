4
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,440
- Come on, please.

5
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:45,773
Come on.

6
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,780
<i>Is there anybody in there?</i>

7
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,645
- Shit.

8
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:52,982
<i>Open this goddamn door</i>

9
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,417
Is he back yet?

10
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,987
That deadbeat still owes me
from yesterday.

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,328
Hey, look, you got 15 minutes
before I call the cops.

12
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,564
Take a bath.

13
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,694
What's happening?

14
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,407
Hey, come on now!

15
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,335
Miss?

16
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:56,238
Miss--
excuse me, sweetheart?

17
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,806
Are you okay?

18
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:01,377
<i>- Is anyone coming to get you?</i>
- He left me.

19
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,980
Come with me. This is not
a safe neighborhood. Come on.

20
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,025
Come on, come with me.

21
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,288
Come on, I'm going to take
you back to my house.

22
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,954
What's your name, miss?

23
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,431
He said, "This time, Dawn, it's gonna be
different. It'll be different."

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,525
Now we've been in that
shithole for days now.

25
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,400
- Who? Who is it that said this?
- John!

26
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,564
<i>My fucking boyfriend.</i>

27
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:26,539
Mailbox 8860,
it's a message from Dawn.

28
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:30,105
Can you have it read,
"John, it's Dawn, I'm in Hollywood.

29
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:33,085
Some holy roller found me
on the street, come fucking get me"?

30
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,611
<i>- I'm sorry, I won't be able to--</i>
- Okay, how about, "John, it's Dawn.

31
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,988
I'm in Hollywood.
Come get me, cocksucker"?

32
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:42,085
<i>All right, can you just tell him</i>

<i>555-7132.</i>

34
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,639
Dawn, this boyfriend of yours,
this John--

35
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,544
talk about your demons--
he's bad news.

36
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:03,105
Look, I'm not going to sit here
and rattle on and on

37
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,415
- about Satan and drugs and--
- Do you have any beer?

38
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:10,286
- Dawn, you are in grave danger.

39
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:14,225
- Are you going to see this guy again?
- That sounds like his car.

40
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,319
- Did he call?
- Dawn--

41
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,759
Sally, thank you
so much for your help and stuff.

42
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,895
Look, you have my number.
Call me--

43
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,906
Hi, everybody.
Dawn, I was so worried about you.

44
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:31,103
I'm sure you're fucking worried.
What the fuck? You just left me there!

45
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:34,705
Again! Again, John! Jesus Christ,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

46
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,544
Are you going to be
all right, Dawn?

47
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,676
What the fuck is that?
Leaving me there again?

48
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,879
Sorry, domestic squabble.
Could we have a minute?

49
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:47,160
You hold on for a second, mister,
you are not off the hook yet, okay?

50
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,024
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

51
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:52,554
- Seriously, I was fucking scared.
- Yeah, let's have a chat, okay?

52
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,726
How's that? Is that okay?

53
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,634
Holy shit! What is that?

54
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,206
That's the big one, baby.
Didn't I tell you?

55
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:02,174
- What is it?
- Didn't I say?

56
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:04,642
Whatever it takes
to get you out of here.

57
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:08,112
That I was going to do whatever
it takes to get you...

58
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,978
back?

59
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,417
- That's just a lot of cocaine.
- For the weather.

60
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,717
There's a cold front
coming in from the east,

61
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,189
carrying with it anticipation,
and heavy skies.

62
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,021
- Oh, baby, I can't do--
<i>- So strap your skis</i>

63
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,994
to the roof of your car,
'cause it looks like snow.

64
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:26,863
Mountains and mountains of snow.

65
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,231
Oh, wait.

66
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,402
Oh, shit! Fuck, that's
pretty fucking good.

67
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,169
It's only going to get better.
Now what do you want, baby?

68
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:38,905
- Tell me what you want.
- I want to do another one of those.

69
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,776
Okay, okay.

70
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,109
- No.
- No, no, please?

71
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,150
- All right.
- No, please?

72
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,775
All right.

Where are we going, really?

154
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,988
- I got to make one stop first, okay?
- No.

155
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,827
- Just one. Yeah, then we'll go.
- No!

156

<i>- Yes, he does.</i>

We're taking a drive.

00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,037
Eddie Nash.

257
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,872
His real name is Adel Nasrallah.

258
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:36,142
He steps off a plane from Palestine
in 1953 with nothing--

259
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,048
he's got four shekels
and a bag of dirt.

260
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:43,054
By 1954, he's got a little hot dog cart
on Hollywood Boulevard,

261
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,420
right outside
the Seven Seas Restaurant.

262
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,789
By 1960, he owns the place.

263
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,819
<i>Now, he parlays the money he gets from</i>
<i>the Seven Seas into two more places,</i>

264
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,422
<i>and they take the fuck off.</i>

265
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:58,061
By 1969, he's got like
20, 25 liquor licenses.

266
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,571
- So he's got friends.
- Yeah, he's got friends.

267
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,608
He's the biggest
nightclub owner in Hollywood.

268
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:06,144
<i>Here's a guy who has been under</i>
<i>investigation for arson</i>

269
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,648
<i>for the last five years,</i>
<i>yet he still goes out to dinner</i>

270
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,615
<i>with the fire commissioner</i>
<i>twice a week.</i>

271
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,676
Rumor has it that
he has got 40 acres in the desert

272
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,450
filled with human skulls,
except he's removed the teeth

273
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,286
so we can't identify 'em.

274
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,451
- Jesus Christ.
- Close.

275
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,324
Eddie Nash.

276
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,744
Billy and Joy.

277
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,531
Ronnie...

278
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,569
Susan.

279
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,317
<i>Mr. Lind.</i>

280
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,859
I'm Detective Nico,
this is Detective Cruz.

281
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:33,023
This one--
this one here, did she make it?

282
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:35,567
Barbara Richardson.

283
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,470
Butterfly.

284
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:07,625
Mr. Lind.

285
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,098
Mr. Lind.

286
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,743
Should we go in there?

287
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,419
Okay.

288
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,591
You guys want to hear a story?

289
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,108
This whole thing started with guns.

290
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:53,339
Four antique guns
that Ron Launius couldn't fence.

291
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,573
Ron Launius was your friend?

292
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,479
We were in business together.

293
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:01,713
What kind of business?

294
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,846
You know, you guys haven't
read me my rights.

295
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,084
Nothing I tell you is admissible.

296
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,490
We just want to hear
your story, Dave, all right?

297
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:09,721
All right.

298
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:14,961
I met Ron Launius
in Chino in 1973.

299
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:17,195
We stayed tight.
A few months ago

300
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,271
he and Billy came up
to Sacramento to see me.

301
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:23,172
They had a small operation here in LA
that was really starting to cook.

302
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:26,006
Drugs?

303
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,376
Now he and Billy Deverell
were partners?

304
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,813
Yep, ran it right out of the house.

305
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:33,818
3678 Wonderland.

306
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:37,287
Billy...

307
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,756
Billy was a good old boy.

308
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,123
Solid, dependable.

309
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:47,957
He wanted to get out of the life,
but the life was just too good.

310
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,766
<i>See, they were getting</i>
<i>large quantities of shit dirt cheap,</i>

311
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:56,273
<i>stepping on it five, six times</i>
<i>and then dumping it all over town.</i>

312
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:59,038
- Heads up, dickheads.
<i>- Business was so good</i>

313
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:03,605
<i>that they needed an extra hand,</i>
<i>which is when Barbara and I showed up.</i>

314
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:08,143
<i>When we pulled up</i>
<i>the party was in full swing.</i>

315
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,246
<i>Bodies everywhere, I mean it was</i>
<i>the kind of place that made you think</i>

316
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,951
<i>you were right back</i>
<i>in the summer of love.</i>

317
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:17,018
<i>Me and Barb, we'd been</i>
<i>on the road all day long</i>

318
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:20,224
<i>and all I could think about</i>
<i>was a place to crash.</i>

319
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:26,064
<i>But when I walked up the stairs,</i>
<i>I saw all the old friends,</i>

320
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:29,869
<i>all the smiles.</i>

321
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:32,809
<i>Goddamn, if it didn't</i>
<i>feel good to be home.</i>

322
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:40,143
<i># Except it's gonna feel good</i>
<i>just to get back home #</i>

323
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:45,157
<i># How it's gonna feel good</i>
<i>just to get back home... #</i>

324
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:48,250
Davey! Yes, brother!

325
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,261
<i>I saw Cherokee straight off.</i>

326
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,296
Welcome home!

327
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,763
<i>He was one of Ronnie's boys.</i>
<i>He set me up,</i>

328
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,199
<i>- he set me walking.</i>
- Right this way, my man.

329
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,759
Right this way.
Follow me right up here.

330
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:02,500
<i>There was Billy, his wife Joy--</i>

331
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:05,806
<i>it was her place.</i>

332
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:09,939
<i>She had just beaten breast cancer</i>
<i>and found a new lease on life.</i>

333
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,848
- This is Barbara.
- Hi.

334
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,182
<i>She was a real generous woman.</i>

335
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,381
Nice. Thank you.

336
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,427
- Barbara.
- Where is he?

337
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:24,622
Right up there, my brother.

338
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:28,599
<i>Ron was in the back. That's when</i>
<i>I first saw the antique guns.</i>

339
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:33,505
Hey, my man!

340
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:36,200
Yeah, buddy,
there you are, man.

341
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,042
Ronnie!

342
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,844
Davey.

343
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,986
He was fearless.
He was the kind of guy,

344
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,787
you put a gun to his head
and his pulse wouldn't break 70.

345
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,124
Is it hot in here?
'Cause I'm roasting.

346
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,926
Summer, baby, bummer.

347
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:03,400
Hey, you think it's hot in here?
I saw the Dead play Grass Valley--

348
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:06,165
Ah, you must be Barbara,
are you enjoying yourself?

349
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:08,866
Yeah, this is the best party
I've ever been to.

350
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,601
It's only the beginning, baby.

351
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,837
LA in the summer--
anything can happen, right?

352
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:17,680
How you doin', man?
You see my new toys? Check these out.

353
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:21,947
- These for real?
- Yeah, I got two more in the bed.

354
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,922
'Cause, like, these are worth
a lot of money, Ronnie.

355
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,083
That's why I can't find
a fence, brother.

356
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:30,686
- What about Slim Jim?
- He said they're too high profile.

357
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:33,129
Hey! Come on.

358
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,065
Where're we sleeping?

359
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:41,902
You see the couch when you walked in?
That's where you're sleeping.

360
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:46,070
I just wanted to get alone
with Barbara, spend some quiet time.

361
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,074
Goddamn, she was
happy to be there.

362
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,314
<i>She had never been</i>
<i>south of Bakersfield.</i>

363
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:01,218
<i>And here she was in LA,</i>

364
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,989
<i>because I told her she</i>
<i>could be Lana Turner...</i>

365
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,394
<i>or Barbara Eden.</i>

366
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:13,772
<i>And she believed me.</i>

367
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,868
<i>This is so fucked up.</i>

368
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,936
This is so fucked up.

369
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,025
Where was I?

370
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,061
<i>You were at a party.</i>

371
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,892
Yeah.

372
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,729
That's when I first met him.

373
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:45,702
<i>- He was talking to Ron.</i>
<i>- rich...</i>

374
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,198
- Ronnie--
- Hey.

375
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:52,277
John Holmes, this is my business
partner, David Lind.

376
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,073
Hey, what's up?
Now the deal with the Arabs--

377
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:58,207
John, this is
my <i>business partner,</i> Dave.

378
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,218
Oh, cool, hey.

379
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,914
So I was just telling Ronnie
about this business proposition

380
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,388
about this Arab,
who's a really wealthy business man

381
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,119
and he calls me brother
and he literally has mountains of cash

382
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,821
- and drugs.
<i>- Wait a minute, John Holmes?</i>

383
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:14,229
<i>- The</i> John Holmes?
- Yep.

384
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,497
- Johnny Wadd partied at Wonderland?
- All the time.

385
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:21,198
The guy is a fucking cokehead.
He's up to his neck in the shit.

386
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,332
Wait, who's John Holmes?

387
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,342
The porn king.

388
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:27,879
Sam, the guy's a legend.

389
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,440
Never heard of him.

390
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:35,681
I knew who he was, but I wasn't
going to make a big thing out of it.

391
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,245
He blew me off, too.

392
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,485
Ron, I'm not fucking lying, man.

393
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,424
- Just hear me out on it.
- Are you John Holmes?

394
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,587
- No.
- Come on, John, don't lie to her.

395
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,824
- What's your name, baby?
- Janet.

396
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:48,628
You wanna see it?

397
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:51,932
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

398
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,130
- Show her, John.
- Ron, stop.

399
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,231
Show her. Or I'll fucking
shoot it, man.

400
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,573
- Look, man, that could be loaded.

401
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:03,806
I'll fucking shoot it, man.

402
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,279
<i>Wow.</i>

403
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:14,085
- Can I touch it?
- Yeah, baby, go ahead.

404
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:21,458
Enjoy your evening, ladies.

405
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,465
Put it in your pants, John.

406
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:29,871
The whole party didn't come
to see your cock.

407
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,911
I don't understand. Why did John Holmes
hang out in Wonderland?

408
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:35,469
He burnt every other
drug dealer in town.

409
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,913
Ronnie was the only guy
who would let him hang out.

410
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:42,010
John is a scumbag. Stone thief.
Guy's bad news.

411
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,481
But Ronnie...

412
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,993
he liked the novelty.
And John...

413
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,325
<i>he liked our drugs.</i>

414
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,299
Baby, I need a hit real bad.

415
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:58,063
I made the calls, there's nothing around
till the weekend.

416
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,468
Yeah, I can't wait that long.
Did you talk to Diaz?

417
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:04,066
<i>- Nobody's holding.</i>
- I know a gal out in Tarzana...

418
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:05,666
who might be able
to make a phone call.

419
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:08,303
- Works at Captain Pizza?
- Fucking pizza joint, man?

420
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,110
You think I want some fucking pizza?
You think I'm hungry?

421
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,481
<i>The only thing I want right now</i>
<i>is some dope, man.</i>

422
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:17,044
- The Arab's got some China White.
<i>- LA was dry, no one was holding,</i>

423
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:20,717
but Ronnie was looking
for a long shot, he was dope sick.

424
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:21,987
So the Arab was Eddie Nash?

425
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:24,393
But I didn't realize that
till later-- I'll get to that.

426
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,556
So Holmes offers to do us a favor--

427
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:29,066
<i>he says he'll take Ronnie's</i>
<i>antique guns up to the Arab</i>

428
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:32,592
<i>to trade for as much China</i>
<i>and blow as he could get.</i>

429
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:35,639
Sounded like a good plan,
but only he's gone eight hours.

430
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:39,165
Finally, he comes back in,
high as a kite, empty-handed--

431
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,506
of course, he has a story.

432
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:43,275
Where is he? It's a 10-minute drive.
I'm going to kill this snake.

433
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,373
The guy's a basehead, Ronnie.
What do you want?

434
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,216
- Did you get it?
- Oh, man.

435
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,018
The Arab was
like crazy-man psycho.

436
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:55,060
He's basing for three days straight.
He keeps me prisoner, man.

437
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,357
- He fucking stole the guns--
- Bullshit, you scumbag!

438
00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:00,091
Where would I go with a lame-ass story
like that? Ron, Ron, Ron!

439
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,531
Ronnie, no, not in my house.

440
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:09,904
It was bullshit!
Ronnie was furious.

441
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,671
- Billy gave John...
- Two days-- you have two days.

442
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,803
The money or the guns in two days.

443
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,577
And next time I ain't gonna worry
about your brains on my walls.

444
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,743
Now get the fuck out of here.

445
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,556
Needless to say, we didn't see John
for the next couple of weeks.

446
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:33,063
So I figure we'll never
see him again.

447
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,565
But two weeks later...

448
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,101
- So Susan's coming down.
- Your wife?

449
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,329
<i>- Yeah, next week, man.</i>
- She's not gonna bug us?

450
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:40,928
No, no. Davey, it's--

451
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,802
Holy shit.

452
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:44,866
Look who just walked in.

453
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,610
- Hey, John...
- Ron, I got something big for you.

454
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,420
I'm gonna whack
this motherfucker right now!

455
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:59,218
Look, I was at the Arab's
last Tuesday-- ahh!

456
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:05,859
- Do you even know who the Arab is?
- Who gives a shit? Half a million.

457
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:10,625
A half a million dollars in loot...

458
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:15,499
and I'm still thinking
this is just some fence

459
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,632
this shithead has been feeding on.

460
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,239
I had no idea.

461
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:23,543
You didn't know that the Arab
was Eddie Nash?

462
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:26,516
- No, not then.
<i>- Come on, you had to have an idea.</i>

463
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:29,577
None! I mean, I figured
it was junk talk.

464
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:32,715
<i>You know, the big score,</i>
<i>long-time money. You know the bullshit.</i>

465
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:34,019
Right.

466
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:38,859
It's like clockwork-- he's still got
most of his take before it goes out

467
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:41,593
and all of the next month's shit
coming in at the same time.

468
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:44,227
- That's two month's worth.
- I don't buy it.

469
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,896
- It's a goldmine.
- You got a plan?

470
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:51,305
What, we're just supposed to bust
in there like "The Guns of Navarone"?

471
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,139
I can draw you a map.

472
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,544
- Wait, wait, he drew you a map?
- Yeah.

473
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:58,606
<i>He offered to leave the kitchen door</i>
<i>unlocked for us so we could break in.</i>

474
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:03,484
How many time you been
in that house, John? 20? 30?

475
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:06,752
I've been going there for two,
three years. Dude calls me brother.

476
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:10,226
<i>That closed it for Ronnie.</i>
<i>I could see it in his eyes.</i>

477
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:13,025
<i>He made his decision.</i>

478
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:16,465
<i>We went, cased the place--</i>
<i>I didn't like it.</i>

479
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:22,205
<i>The house came right up</i>
<i>to the property line.</i>

480
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,710
<i>But John, John was</i>
<i>so fucking convincing.</i>

481
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:29,679
The more he said was there,
the more Ronnie wanted to do it.

482
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,579
I told him to forget about it.

483
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,642
Listen, man, call it off.

484
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,086
You got Susan down here,
chill out.

485
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,316
Spend some time,
work things out.

486
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,825
We are going
to work things out, Dave.

487
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:44,555
On a beach, man.

488
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,461
Maui.

489
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:50,297
Like I said, he made his decision.

490
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,802
I figured if he was going to go,

491
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:55,499
I better go
and make sure nothing happened.

492
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:59,976
Okay, let's just back up for a second.
When did Susan Launius arrive?

493
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:03,640
Sometime Sunday. She and Ronnie
were having some problems

494
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,876
<i>so she flew down</i>
<i>to patch things up.</i>

495
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:10,246
Come here.

496
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:14,225
<i>You look so good.</i>
<i>I'll get the other--</i>

497
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:38,447
- Hey.
- Ronnie, what is this?

498
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,678
Goddamn it.
You told me it was gonna be different.

499
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,310
You fucking told me that!

500
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,378
Calm down.
I don't want to start like this again.

501
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,755
- You fucking told me you were clean.
<i>- I am clean, all right?</i>

502
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,818
- Cleaner.
- You looked me right in the eye

503
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:54,263
- and you promised.
- I don't want to start like this!

504
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,324
<i>We start like this</i>
<i>every fucking time.</i>

505
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,767
Please, just take me home.
Please take me home.

506
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,397
I don't want to be here.
Please, take me home.

507
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:06,637
Early that afternoon, Ron gave John
some dough to go to the Arabs

508
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:09,340
to score some dope and to leave
the kitchen door unlocked.

509
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:12,178
Hey-- John.

510
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:17,922
Kitchen door, man.

511
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:27,063
<i># I'm a street-walkin' cheetah</i>
<i>with a heart full of napalm... #</i>

512
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:28,724
It's all right.

513
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,827
<i># I'm a runaway son</i>
<i>of the nuclear A-bomb #</i>

514
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,770
<i># I am the world's</i>
<i>forgotten boy #</i>

515
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:41,142
<i># The one who searches</i>
<i>and destroys... #</i>

516
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,840
- Here.
<i>- # Honey gotta help me please #</i>

517
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,511
<i># Somebody gotta save my soul #</i>

518
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,556
<i># Baby, detonate for me #</i>

519
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,648
<i># Ohh! #</i>

520
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:57,183
<i># Lookout, honey,</i>
<i>'cause I'm using technology #</i>

521
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,423
<i># Ain't got time to make</i>
<i>no apology... #</i>

522
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:05,730
<i>It took him three trips</i>
<i>to get it done.</i>

523
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:09,000
<i>Finally, around 4:00 in the morning</i>
<i>he shows up, says the Arab's asleep,</i>

524
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,575
<i>it's all clear.</i>
<i>I was ready to go.</i>

525
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,541
Get him.

526
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,915
All right, you fucking honk twice
if you see anything.

527
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:22,578
Sounds easy enough, boss.

528
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,513
Rock 'n' roll.

529
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,421
I need a snack first.

530
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,718
Wait, you got high
during the robbery?

531
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:33,390
Not me.
Never when I'm working.

532
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,229
- Oh, come on what do you--
- No, hang on, hang on.

533
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,326
David, when did you
get to the house?

534
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:41,934
Around 8:00 in the morning.

535
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:44,099
<i>We entered through</i>
<i>the kitchen door,</i>

536
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,769
<i>it was unlocked just like</i>
<i>John said it would be.</i>

537
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,795
- Down on the carpet!
- Freeze, motherfucker!

538
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,531
Get down
or I'll fucking waste you!

539
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,999
Down!

540
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:14,195
- Fuck!
- Everybody hit the fucking carpet.

541
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:39,091
- You shot him?

542
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:42,759
Grazed him accidentally
when Ronnie bumped into me.

543
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,734
You grazed him?

544
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:47,771
Mmm, it was a flesh wound.

545
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,807
What the fuck are you doing,
Ronnie?

546
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,309
- What the fuck, man?
- Look at the fucking table!

547
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,607
Who the fuck cares?!
Who the fuck cares?!

548
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,241
- Give me your fucking hand.
- Come on.

549
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,012
Just get up and get to the safe.

550
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:03,520
- Let's go, Ronnie.
- Gimme your other fucking hand.

551
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,488
I don't want to die.
Please don't kill me.

552
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,991
<i>We left Billy downstairs.</i>
<i>We went upstairs for the safe.</i>

553
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,994
<i>John had told us that there was</i>
<i>a safe underneath the bed.</i>

554
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,424
Where the fuck is it, huh?

555
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:15,591
- Eddie?
- What the fuck?

556
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:18,261
<i>No need for violence,</i>
<i>I'll tell you whatever you want.</i>

557
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,201
No violence if you tell me
the fucking truth.

558
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:25,299
- There's nothing in there.
- What the fuck is the combination?

559
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,072
There's nothing in there.
Nothing in that safe.

560
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:29,704
You open your fucking mouth

561
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:32,750
and you tell me the fucking
combination to the safe, motherfucker.

562
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,217
Tell me the combination.

563
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,278
36...

564
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,188
25, 60.

565
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:49,629
Where in the fuck is the rest of it?

566
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:52,829
I will blow your fucking head off,
so help me God, if you don't tell me.

567
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,337
All the drugs are at the Starwood.

568
00:37:56,408 --> 00:37:58,376
<i>And it hit me.</i>

569
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:02,970
This was Eddie Nash--
we were hitting Eddie-fucking-Nash

570
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:05,448
and we were screwed.
I mean, if I had known it was Nash--

571
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,712
Look, I know who Eddie Nash is,

572
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,619
so does Detective Cruz.
Just go on with the story.

573
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:12,384
<i>We took the place apart.</i>

574
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:15,187
<i>Found as much</i>
<i>as we could and split.</i>

575
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,355
Woo-hoo!

576
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,558
And where was Mr. Holmes
during all this?

577
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:58,398
He was waiting back at the house.
I told Ronnie in the car

578
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,834
to keep things cool.

579
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:02,702
But big mouth
couldn't wait to talk.

580
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,299
They're here, they're here!

581
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,942
You are not gonna believe
how much shit we got.

582
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,451
- How much did you get?
- Guess.

583
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,317
- Everything? Even the safe?
- Oh, yeah.

584
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:18,651
Woo!

585
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,020
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.

586
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,753
I knew it would work.

587
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,294
Yeah!

588
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,981
Deal with these.
We'll get to 'em later.

589
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:08,139
I got my guns back!

590
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:14,201
Steady cash.

591
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:17,645
1.2 million? Not bad.

592
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,979
It was a good score.
And nobody got hurt.

593
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,145
Okay. What's next?

594
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:25,519
<i>Holmes immediately starts</i>
<i>bitching about his share.</i>

595
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,320
<i>He was only in for an eighth cut,</i>
<i>and all of a sudden he wanted more.</i>

596
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,827
What, are you fucking kidding me?
This is not my cut.

597
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,692
Scumbag tax. Now we're even.

598
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,733
- Even for what?
- For the guns, John.

599
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,462
- But we got the guns back!
- No, I got the guns back.

600
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,595
You still owe us
for all the coke you smoked.

601
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:43,674
Ronnie, come on,
I got editors that I have to pay.

602
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,538
I have deadlines.
This is not my final cut.

603
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,305
I don't know
what you want me to say, John.

604
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,744
I want you to say
that I can have my cut!

605
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:58,214
Okay, okay,
how about the gems?

606
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,258
You want to wait
for the gems, fine.

607
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:04,159
Joy and I are going to take them
down to Slim's and fence them.

608
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:06,094
<i>Then you can get your cut.</i>

609
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:09,395
There it is, John. That's it.

610
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,527
So Holmes set it up
and he felt entitled.

611
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:17,074
We took all the risks,
he sat home with the girls.

612
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,475
At this point...

613
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:23,036
I decided to treat myself
to a shot of H.

614
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:27,574
You know, a little reward
for a job well done.

615
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,455
<i>After that it's...</i>

616
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,928
<i>it's kind of a blur.</i>

617
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,589
<i>Mailbox 8860.</i>

618
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,758
<i>The password's "palm tree."</i>

619
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,560
There's your cut from the gems, buddy.
Now get the fuck out of here.

620
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,192
- You got to be fucking kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding you, John.

621
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:19,634
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Ron, I have editors--

622
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,069
You think I give a shit that you
have fucking editors?

623
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:27,633
- We're all fucking sick of you!
- I got a deadline. Hear me out.

624
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:30,646
- You got a deadline? What about us?
- I'm just saying that's not my cut.

625
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,513
John, I'm fucking sick of this shit!
Get the fuck out of here!

626
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,313
- Get the fuck out, man!
- I'm just saying--

627
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,051
- Where's your gun, David?
- No, that's cool, man.

628
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:48,924
That's fucking great.

629
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,959
Fuck, man. I'm so fucking sick
of that fucking guy.

630
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,369
Are you going to fucking fix that?

631
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,375
We got enough fucking
money to fix it. We'll fix it.

632
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:02,607
I left the next day-- I had to go
to Sacto overnight for this thing...

633
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,312
and I left Barbara there.

634
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:08,409
When I saw the news
on the television--

635
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:11,580
- it had to be Holmes.
- Why?

636
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:17,224
Hello?

637
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:19,991
Yo, Joey. Joey, look, man,
it's not a good time right now.

638
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,430
- Let me talk to him.
- Hold on, talk to Billy, all right?

639
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:26,832
Hey, man, what's up?
No bullshit, we're closed for the day.

640
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,803
Yeah, all right, man.

641
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:32,609
All right, listen up...

642
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,678
from here on out,
we keep a low profile.

643
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,577
Billy was very specific.

644
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,674
No deals in the house.

645
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:42,811
Everything happens down
at the Canyon Store. I mean it.

646
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:45,651
No one in the house
but inner circle.

647
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:49,124
No one gets buzzed up
unless I say it's okay.

648
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,862
<i>Hey, Holmes,</i>
<i>are you listening to me?</i>

649
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:56,059
No, it's cool, it's cool,
it's cool, it's cool.

650
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:58,329
And with the security gate,
there's no way anybody

651
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:01,200
could've gotten in there
without knowing Billy personally.

652
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:06,335
John was the only one
who knew about the Nash hit.

653
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:09,175
That piece of shit ratted us out,

654
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:13,411
let Nash in
and got my Butterfly killed.

655
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,585
- You guys are out of your minds.
- Let's bring in Nash, Captain.

656
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,453
He killed them plain as day.

657
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:22,959
This whole thing is
circumstantial and you know it.

658
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,927
We've brought in people
with a lot less.

659
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,896
You're talking about Eddie Nash.

660
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:29,559
You don't bring him in till
you got an eyewitness.

661
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:32,000
What do you know?
Some junkies robbed Eddie Nash?

662
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:34,071
Nah, it's bullshit.

663
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:36,402
Find John Holmes.

664
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:39,375
If he tells you that Eddie Nash
picked up a pipe and swung it,

665
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:41,036
maybe we'll arrest him.

666
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:45,408
All right. Come on.

667
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:48,452
You want to nail Eddie Nash.
Fucking crazy.

668
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,787
Could I have a cigarette?

669
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:05,928
Thank you.

670
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:09,006
It's all over the news
that four people are dead.

671
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:11,075
John.

672
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:16,042
Well...

673
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:18,639
um...

674
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,581
four?

675
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:25,886
- How long have I been out?
- For like a day.

676
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:29,518
You've taken me up to that street
before. There was the house, John.

677
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,954
- You know, the house.
- Really?

678
00:45:41,506 --> 00:45:44,100
You had a nightmare,
you were screaming...

679
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:47,177
about blood.
You were screaming in your sleep.

680
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:51,212
Yeah, I had a...

681
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:54,547
my nose... on the trunk.

682
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:58,578
I hit my nose on--
the trunk on my nose.

683
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:01,819
LAPD, freeze! In the air, in the air!
Hands in the air!

684
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:22,203
Okay, Dawn,

685
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,646
I've got some photographs
I'd like you to look at.

686
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:27,115
You ever seen that house?

687
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,485
No.

688
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:33,524
Are you sure?

689
00:46:38,596 --> 00:46:40,393
All right.

690
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:42,831
How about here?

691
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,670
Nope.

692
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,368
<i>Let me see.</i>

693
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:58,176
<i>More fucking blue.</i>

694
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:00,683
Baby...

695
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,720
Say your name.
"My name's Gabrielle."

696
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:06,450
- Say it.
- My name is Gabrielle.

697
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:08,685
- Say it.
- My name-- hi, my name--

698
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,852
What the fuck are you
talking about?

699
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:12,691
God, John, Jesus Christ!

700
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:15,357
Shut up!

701
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:19,199
Pay attention and be real.
He will cut your fucking head off

702
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:22,739
and take you to the desert
and bury you.

703
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:25,367
- I know that!
- Just look in the mirror.

704
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:26,875
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

705
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,377
- Just look in the mirror.
- Fuck!

706
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:30,846
Just look in the mirror,
just look in the mirror.

707
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:35,744
- What's your name?
- My name is Gabrielle.

708
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,412
Take a deep breath.
It's just a thing.

709
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:39,752
I've been with 1,000 women,
they didn't mean anything.

710
00:47:39,824 --> 00:47:42,657
I don't want to go.

711
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:45,059
You don't have to go
if you don't want to.

712
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:47,529
You don't have to go.
Fuck it.

713
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,300
Just go in and say hi.

714
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:01,003
<i>- Just like 10 minutes.</i>
- Man, fuckin' A.

715
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:03,046
<i>It's just we owe him</i>
<i>so much money, baby.</i>

716
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:05,446
You look beautiful.

717
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:10,280
No, it's okay.

718
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:16,950
<i>Do you know that guy?</i>

719
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,339
No.

720
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,708
Merry Christmas, baby.

721
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:43,921
Nash!

722
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,924
So what do you want me to do?

723
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:01,936
I want you to dance for me.

724
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:09,007
You mean just like--
just dance?

725
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:12,549
Dance.

726
00:49:37,108 --> 00:49:39,508
Fuck it.

727
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:48,578
Dawn.

728
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:51,778
Dawn.

729
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:55,292
I was wrong. I was wrong.
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

730
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:02,933
Move closer.

731
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,810
Oh, no, no, no.

732
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:16,210
No.

733
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,443
It's wrong, I'm sorry, baby.

734
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:27,783
Touch me.

735
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:45,735
You've never seen him?

736
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,909
I think I'd remember
meeting somebody like that.

737
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:54,677
Don't you?

738
00:50:54,752 --> 00:50:56,845
Okay.

739
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:02,318
This is my partner Luis Cruz. He's
going to give you a ride home, okay?

740
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:57,803
I'll just keep scrubbing
to get it all off.

741
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:19,358
You know I'm sorry, right?

742
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:26,372
All right.
You ready?

743
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:28,742
Do you have any place to go?

744
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:52,127
<i>Excuse me, miss?</i>
<i>Do you want me to go with you?</i>

745
00:52:52,236 --> 00:52:54,067
<i>- No, that's cool.</i>
<i>- You sure?</i>

746
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,629
<i>- Yeah, thanks.</i>

747
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,689
I have no place else to go.

748
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,490
Okay. Come on.

749
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:21,724
<i>Ms. Holmes, you sure you don't</i>
<i>need me to come inside?</i>

750
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:24,267
No, we're good.
No, no. Thank you.

751
00:53:27,972 --> 00:53:30,805
Okay.

752
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:34,208
- I'm really not that hungry.
- You eat, sweetie.

753
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:36,405
Worst decision a person
can make

754
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,449
is to make a decision
on an empty stomach.

755
00:53:39,517 --> 00:53:41,985
<i>...connection with</i>
<i>the Laurel Canyon murders.</i>

756
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,647
<i>Police have taken X-rated film star</i>
<i>John Holmes into custody.</i>

757
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:48,920
<i>Holmes, known in the adult film industry</i>
<i>as Johnny Wadd,</i>

758
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:51,723
<i>has starred in over 1,000</i>
<i>X-rated films.</i>

759
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:54,491
<i>Those murders that occurred</i>
<i>up on Wonderland Avenue...</i>

760
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,795
He hasn't even done a movie
in like two years.

761
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:58,858
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

762
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:02,905
What involvement John Holmes may have
had in the murders is still unclear,

763
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,736
but we should find out tomorrow

764
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:06,901
when he's arraigned
in downtown Los Angeles.

765
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:10,174
We are learning a little more
about Holmes' private life.

766
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,738
<i>We've uncovered court papers</i>
<i>indicating the porn star</i>

767
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:15,182
<i>is currently married,</i>
<i>but estranged from his wi--</i>

768
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:31,291
What are you doing
back with him, Dawn?

769
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:33,597
<i>I haven't seen you</i>
<i>in almost a year,</i>

770
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:35,433
<i>and I figured</i>
<i>you just got away from him.</i>

771
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:37,803
I did. I did.

772
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:39,843
I ran away.
I got away, Sharon.

773
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:42,310
To Oregon,
I was there for two months.

774
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:47,145
And I had a job, too.
I was a nurse, kind of like you.

775
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:56,350
But you know, he just kept calling.

776
00:54:56,427 --> 00:54:58,588
You know? He just wouldn't stop.

777
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,527
Every day, three times a day.

778
00:55:00,598 --> 00:55:02,793
At first I didn't even take
his phone calls.

779
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:06,027
He would tell
my mother every single night,

780
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,366
"Tell Dawn I love her,
tell her goodnight."

781
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:10,599
Every single night
before I went to bed.

782
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:13,802
So you know, I took his call.

783
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,172
I took his call.

784
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:21,249
I didn't say a word.

785
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,286
Nothing.

786
00:55:28,626 --> 00:55:31,527
And then he says...

787
00:55:31,595 --> 00:55:34,758
he says,
"I can hear you breathe, baby."

788
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:41,603
And I knew that just my breathing
was enough to keep him going

789
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:44,607
so that he knew he wasn't alone,
because he had me.

790
00:55:46,977 --> 00:55:49,537
He's using you, Dawn.
When are you going to see that?

791
00:55:49,613 --> 00:55:52,776
<i>- He's been using you for five years.</i>
- No, he's not.

792
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:56,782
No, he's not,
'cause you know why? I'm his girl.

793
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:58,651
I'm his girl.

794
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,451
Since I was 15, I've been his girl.
Since...

795
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:03,823
that night in the van at the beach,
I've been his girl.

796
00:56:03,894 --> 00:56:07,022
You gotta get away
from him, baby.

797
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:11,397
You take all the bad stuff
and you put it in a box,

798
00:56:11,502 --> 00:56:15,939
and then you just put it in a closet
and never look at it again.

799
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:19,571
And then you move on.

800
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:42,665
<i>He wants to talk to us.</i>

801
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:45,463
We're willing to protect John
if he tells us everything.

802
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:49,005
But he's scared
and he fears for your safety.

803
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:51,473
So he wants to see you both
before he says anything.

804
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:52,702
So where is he?

805
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:55,370
He's staying at a suite
at the Bonaparte Hotel downtown.

806
00:56:55,446 --> 00:56:57,607
Dawn, do you want to go see John?

807
00:56:57,681 --> 00:56:59,581
Yeah, don't you?

808
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:21,794
Detective.

809
00:57:31,882 --> 00:57:34,077
- Would you give me some privacy?
- Okay, sure.

810
00:57:37,721 --> 00:57:39,689
Hi.

811
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:47,155
Don't say anything,
the room's bugged.

812
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:50,496
We're going to go talk
for a minute, okay, baby?

813
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:19,653
Okay, they've offered me a deal
and I think I'm going to take it.

814
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:23,325
They're going to put me in
the witness protection program <i>if...</i>

815
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,391
I tell them everything,
everything I told you.

816
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:28,233
Except I'm not saying
anything about anything <i>unless</i>

817
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,306
- all three of us can go.
- All three of us?

818
00:58:30,374 --> 00:58:32,672
- And they agreed.
- Who's all three of us?

819
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:34,574
You me and Dawn,
we can go tomorrow.

820
00:58:34,645 --> 00:58:37,205
No, I'm not going
anywhere tomorrow. No.

821
00:58:37,281 --> 00:58:40,216
No, Sharon, that's okay, they've got
people that can come and pack you.

822
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:42,309
No, no, no, John.
No, I am not going

823
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:45,287
into the witness protection program
with you. That's that.

824
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,913
- Yes.
- No.

825
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,891
- Yes, Sha-- this is the new start--
- No. I'm not going into it.

826
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,724
- Listen, this is the new start--
- No, you gotta listen!

827
00:58:52,796 --> 00:58:54,787
Everything that we planned
could happen now.

828
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,992
I don't want a fresh start
with you, John.

829
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:58,967
- Wake up!
- Oh, listen...

830
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:01,162
No, you listen,
I am through supporting you.

831
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,899
You think I would just leave
and never see my family again?

832
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:05,872
- Sharon--
- It's gone too far this time.

833
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:07,467
If you don't help me with this,
I am dead.

834
00:59:07,578 --> 00:59:08,943
You're already dead.

835
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:10,980
This one last thing is all
I'm asking for,

836
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,278
you've got--
you've got to do it!

837
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,580
Stop it, John. Just stop it.

838
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:17,643
What? Sharon--

839
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:20,485
- Don't cry. Don't you dare cry.
- Listen, if you don't help--

840
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,923
That's not going to work anymore.

841
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:25,291
You think I'd go anywhere
with you after this?

842
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:28,854
Sharon, I am not going
to survive this without you. Okay?

843
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:31,162
Really? You don't think
you'll survive?

844
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:33,395
You told me you were a survivor.

845
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,529
Remember that? Look at how
you're surviving, John.

846
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,406
- Why did you come down here then?
- What choice do I have?

847
00:59:40,477 --> 00:59:43,378
- What choice do I have?
- Why haven't you divorced me?

848
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,481
I don't know, I don't know.

849
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:50,646
Sharon, because you love me
and you want to help me.

850
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:53,713
It's too late, John. It's too late.

851
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,985
- Sharon, look at me.
- No.

852
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:59,051
Sharon, I know you love me,
and I love you.

853
00:59:59,129 --> 01:00:02,292
Do you remember
that day 15 years ago in the bathroom

854
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:03,958
when you were
measuring yourself?

855
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:06,093
- Yes.
<i>- Do you remember that?</i>

856
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:08,330
<i>Remember what you said to me?</i>

857
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,703
I said that I've, I...

858
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:14,175
finally found what I wanted
to do with my life.

859
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:17,543
Uh-huh, right.
That's what you said.

860
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,343
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>what I said to you?</i>

861
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:22,613
<i>- What did I say?</i>
- What do you want me to say?

862
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:25,154
You said that if I sold my...

863
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:28,123
- That's right. What did <i>I say to you?</i>

864
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:31,217
You tell me who you are.
What did I say to you?!

865
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:36,554
You said anyone
that sells their...

866
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:41,498
their body is a whore.

867
01:00:41,605 --> 01:00:43,004
Uh-huh.

868
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:48,373
Stay away from the house.

869
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:15,871
<i>- How's my girl?</i>
<i>- Fine.</i>

870
01:01:43,934 --> 01:01:46,869
Detective Ward, thank you
for coming out on such short notice.

871
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:49,405
Captain Nimziki
explained the urgency.

872
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:52,942
Has he backed up any
of Lind's testimony?

873
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,978
- He's hinting.
- Hinting?

874
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:56,875
He knows a lot.

875
01:01:56,947 --> 01:01:59,415
He's just playing his cards
very close to the chest.

876
01:01:59,483 --> 01:02:01,383
What's he want?

877
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:04,784
- Immunity.
- What else?

878
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:09,089
- Protection.
- Really?

879
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:11,093
<i>- How many you think?</i>
- I have no idea.

880
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:14,490
- No idea? You never counted?
- No, no.

881
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,089
- Most men have.
- All right.

882
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:18,998
Why do you think that is?

883
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:21,570
I don't know.
I guess it's their ego.

884
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,137
Well, I'm thinking...

885
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:28,006
- I'm thinking Boca.
- Boca Raton?

886
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:30,774
- Yeah, is there another Boca?
- Only one. Anywhere you want.

887
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:32,872
That's the only one
I ever heard of, Boca Raton.

888
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:36,214
I'm thinking Boca
'cause I'm thinking of an alligator.

889
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:39,119
<i>Can you get me an alligator?</i>
<i>Can you give me an alligator?</i>

890
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:41,885
I can see Boca, I can see
the condominium,

891
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,619
I can see an alligator--
like on a chain.

892
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,388
Right, right.

893
01:02:45,462 --> 01:02:47,453
I need something
that implicates Eddie Nash.

894
01:02:47,531 --> 01:02:51,092
On the record. Why don't you
tell me about the robbery?

895
01:02:51,168 --> 01:02:52,658
What robbery?

896
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:57,395
- Hey, Bill.
- Hiya, John.

897
01:02:57,507 --> 01:02:58,565
- How you been?
- Good.

898
01:02:58,675 --> 01:03:00,199
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

899
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:02,005
I'm not talking in front
of these guys.

900
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:08,709
Did you ever get those cigars
I sent you?

901
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,777
- Oh, they were good.
- Right, the best.

902
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:14,050
- You got taste.
- Yeah, you look good.

903
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,251
Thank you, John.

904
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:18,794
- What are you working on?
- Administrative Vice.

905
01:03:18,862 --> 01:03:20,989
Administrative?
You got a desk job?

906
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:23,430
- That's insane, man.
- I'm an old man, John.

907
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,469
I guess. You break your legs
or something? Jesus.

908
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,937
No, I've been doing good.
You haven't though, from what I hear.

909
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:31,633
Yeah, what'd you hear?

910
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:35,108
You're doing a lot of drugs,
partying with the wrong crowd.

911
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:37,840
Yeah, I'm a drug addict, Bill.

912
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,975
I know, John.

913
01:03:42,052 --> 01:03:44,077
I know about the robbery

914
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,315
that you and all those dead people
up on Wonderland

915
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,619
pulled on Eddie Nash.

916
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:51,320
<i>You know, I'm not here as a cop.</i>
<i>I'm here as your friend.</i>

917
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:54,522
No, I know that Bill, thanks for coming
down. And thanks for the room.

918
01:03:54,598 --> 01:03:57,465
It's nice.
Everyone's been really good.

919
01:03:57,534 --> 01:03:59,161
Want to tell me about it, or...

920
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:02,102
- is this just a waste of my time?
- No, come on.

921
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:05,141
- Can we take a drive?
- I wish we could, John.

922
01:04:06,643 --> 01:04:08,770
You got any coke?

923
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,311
No, I can't do that.

924
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:16,318
How about a coffee then with like
a million fucking sugars?

925
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:19,287
<i>Just tell the story, John.</i>
<i>Tell me what you know.</i>

926
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:21,483
<i>We got a deal?</i>

927
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:25,154
Talk to me, John.
Just tell me about it.

928
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:26,786
<i>Sure, I'll tell you a story.</i>

929
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,491
<i>But if we don't have a deal,</i>
<i>then it's just a story, right?</i>

930
01:04:29,566 --> 01:04:31,659
<i>I'm listening, John.</i>

931
01:04:31,735 --> 01:04:35,102
Okay, I'm gonna tell you a story,
a story called "Wonderland."

932
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,537
Wonderland's the house everyone
on the whole mountain

933
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:38,699
hopes would burn down.

934
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:40,776
<i>The lease was in Joy's name--</i>
<i>Joy Miller.</i>

935
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:44,108
<i>She was a rich westie that got all</i>
<i>junked up, got cancer,</i>

936
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:46,274
<i>both breasts removed,</i>
<i>still shooting junk.</i>

937
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:48,374
Her old man Billy Deverell...

938
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:51,716
<i>is a kind of a dumb hick</i>
<i>who couldn't really make up his mind</i>

939
01:04:51,788 --> 01:04:54,814
about anything without a guy
like Ron Launius around

940
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,358
<i>to come up with the idea.</i>

941
01:04:56,426 --> 01:04:59,725
Ronnie's crazy and unpredictable,
but was always good with me

942
01:04:59,796 --> 01:05:03,197
until he got hooked up
with one of the sleaziest scumbags

943
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:04,597
<i>to ever come down the pike.</i>

944
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:08,297
Dude from Sacramento-- biker.
This guy, stone-cold killer,

945
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:11,841
a liar, a thief and a rapist.

946
01:05:13,944 --> 01:05:15,377
What was his name?

947
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:17,345
David Lind.
Don't believe a word he says.

948
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,974
Now you know me a long time, right?
I can judge a character.

949
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,312
<i>I know when a scene</i>
<i>is a scene.</i>

950
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:23,409
This guy becomes the brains
of the operation.

951
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,681
So when they get too strung out
to do anything,

952
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,315
- then he's got the perfect solution.
- What?

953
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:29,653
They stole.

954
01:05:29,726 --> 01:05:31,990
The kinda stuff that doesn't get
reported stolen.

955
01:05:32,062 --> 01:05:34,553
<i>- Drugs?</i>
- Drugs, guns, money, anything.

956
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:36,963
Whatever they wanted they took--
smash and grab stuff.

957
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:39,593
How about that fucking coffee?

958
01:05:39,703 --> 01:05:41,898
Now I knew a big time fence
lived up The Donas.

959
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:43,472
- Eddie Nash?
- Yeah.

960
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:46,008
What is he, your friend
or your connection? What?

961
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:49,203
We hung out.
Bill, I'm not like an altar boy.

962
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,577
I'd love to show you the boat.

963
01:05:51,648 --> 01:05:54,242
- Is this your boat?
- No.

964
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:56,148
<i># Girls on film... #</i>

965
01:05:56,753 --> 01:05:57,879
<i>Hey...</i>

966
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:01,151
I know you,
you're Johnny Wadd!

967
01:06:01,224 --> 01:06:03,852
- Yeah.
- Johnny Wadd on my boat!

968
01:06:03,927 --> 01:06:06,691
I love your movies, man.

969
01:06:06,763 --> 01:06:08,492
- Your name?
- Eddie Nash.

970
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:12,057
This is my boat.
I'm your biggest fan.

971
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:14,864
I see all your movies, yes.
Get out of here!

972
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,768
Yes...

973
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,675
- big star John Wadd. Very big.

974
01:06:21,745 --> 01:06:24,646
Hey, listen, John, you come up
my house sometime,

975
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:26,909
- we hang out, we party.
- Sure, sure.

976
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,645
I make a little coffee, we hang out,
we do other things.

977
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:31,516
- You know what I'm saying?

978
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:34,148
I knew him. Anyway,

979
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:37,716
these guys do a big score
down at-- oh, thanks.

980
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:38,988
They hit a mark in West Covina

981
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:42,156
and got their hands on four antique
guns, really beautiful museum pieces.

982
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:45,326
Nice tooling and all that. I didn't
think Eddie would want the guns,

983
01:06:45,435 --> 01:06:46,959
<i>and I told David this.</i>

984
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:50,631
But I didn't feel like getting my ass
kicked either, so I go up there.

985
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:51,934
And I was right.

986
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,978
Eddie can't fence the guns,
he says they're too fancy,

987
01:06:56,046 --> 01:06:58,640
too high profile,
so he gave us like two grand

988
01:06:58,715 --> 01:07:00,615
as collateral.

989
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:02,879
That is bullshit.

990
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,920
Fucking bullshit, man.

991
01:07:04,988 --> 01:07:06,979
<i>Eddie Nash,</i>
<i>scumbag piece of shit.</i>

992
01:07:07,057 --> 01:07:08,957
<i>Somebody ought to hit</i>
<i>that guy, man.</i>

993
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,118
There's long-time money.

994
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:14,493
I take the bad news back
to the boys and what can they do?

995
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:16,498
It's Eddie-fucking-Nash, right?

996
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:18,534
Then like, two weeks later
they call me in,

997
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:21,399
<i>- and David says to me...</i>
- You talk to Nash much?

998
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:23,563
I was over there on Tuesday.

999
01:07:23,673 --> 01:07:25,664
Did he ever mention
those antiques?

1000
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:28,403
- They're still $2,000.
- Screw that. Those are our guns.

1001
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:31,038
How many times you think
you've been in that house?

1002
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:33,082
Like 20, 30 times.

1003
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:35,379
You think you could
draw us a map?

1004
01:07:35,452 --> 01:07:37,682
A map? What for?

1005
01:07:37,754 --> 01:07:41,315
- Don't worry about it, John.
<i>- Did you do it?</i>

1006
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:44,588
What, of the fucking palm trees?
I mean, buy a fucking Thomas Guide.

1007
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:49,157
So we go up there--
this is David's bright idea.

1008
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:52,167
<i>David, Ronnie, Billy--</i>
<i>everyone's sitting in the car</i>

1009
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:54,203
<i>across the street</i>
<i>from Eddie Nash's house...</i>

1010
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:56,704
In through the kitchen.

1011
01:07:56,773 --> 01:07:58,001
Definitely.

1012
01:07:58,108 --> 01:08:00,542
<i>...and David's sitting there</i>
<i>drawing a map.</i>

1013
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:03,009
I tried to talk him out of it,
I swear to God,

1014
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,013
I'm sitting there in the car,
I'm saying...

1015
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,514
You guys are joking, right?

1016
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,011
John, shut your hole.

1017
01:08:12,222 --> 01:08:15,350
<i>So all of a sudden David's got</i>
<i>everybody all hopped up.</i>

1018
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:19,691
Then they decided,
let's stop talking and start taking.

1019
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:21,560
Look, I know
an actress in Tarzana

1020
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:25,362
and she's got like a wall of TVs
and like three microwaves.

1021
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:26,730
What are you, a nigger?

1022
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:29,066
You have any brains
or did it all go to your cock?

1023
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:30,867
You want to steal a microwave?

1024
01:08:30,974 --> 01:08:33,033
What the fuck are we going
to do with a microwave?

1025
01:08:33,143 --> 01:08:35,839
- Heat your food up with it.
- You think I'm hungry?

1026
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:38,972
The only thing I want to heat up right
now is some fucking dope, man!

1027
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:40,982
I'm so railed
I can't even think straight.

1028
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:42,881
This town is
a fucking desert, man.

1029
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,420
Did Indo-fucking-china dry up
in this fucking city?

1030
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:48,924
I want some goddamn,
motherfucking smack!

1031
01:08:48,992 --> 01:08:50,619
Shit, David, what the fuck?

1032
01:08:50,693 --> 01:08:52,490
I told you not to let me
do so much blow.

1033
01:08:52,562 --> 01:08:55,827
- You know how I get, shit!
- Even know who Eddie Nash is?

1034
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:58,367
Do you think I give a shit?

1035
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,265
Then they tell me
I gotta participate.

1036
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:03,602
'Cause I know him.
Like knowing him means something.

1037
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:06,437
Yeah, well, I don't want
any part of that, man.

1038
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:12,078
Listen to me, motherfucker,
we're doing this.

1039
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,446
And if I have to whack
that ass-grease knuckle fuck

1040
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,917
to get his shit,
then that's that.

1041
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,648
<i>I could see it in their eyes.</i>

1042
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:21,656
<i>They had made a decision.</i>

1043
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:24,215
I went up there three times
to warn Eddie.

1044
01:09:25,295 --> 01:09:26,819
Eddie, I'm not lying.

1045
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:30,161
You just got to give
those fucking fucks back their guns.

1046
01:09:30,233 --> 01:09:33,828
Fuck you
and fuck your friends.

1047
01:09:33,937 --> 01:09:37,031
But he's based out of his mind--
I mean, crazy man psycho.

1048
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:40,576
- 10 days straight.
- You want the guns from the Nash?

1049
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:41,974
Motherfuck!

1050
01:09:42,045 --> 01:09:45,446
Come up and take them
from the Nash.

1051
01:09:46,483 --> 01:09:47,780
Huh?

1052
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:50,479
And I have to admit this, Bill...

1053
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:53,181
I'm looking right in his eyes
and I'm thinking,

1054
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:55,349
better him than me.

1055
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:00,653
Better him than me.

1056
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:04,623
What did they want you to do
to help them?

1057
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:10,603
Kitchen door.

1058
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:12,800
Cool, man.

1059
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:14,536
They wanted me to...

1060
01:10:14,611 --> 01:10:17,079
unlock, like,
the kitchen door.

1061
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:18,977
Something like that.

1062
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:21,741
Did you do it?

1063
01:10:30,927 --> 01:10:35,057
Yeah.
Yeah, that thing went down.

1064

<i>- # Jesus died for somebody's sins #</i>

1065
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:46,141
<i>- # But not mine #</i>

1066
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:53,011
<i>- # Meltin' in a pot of thieves... #</i>
- Get him.

1067
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,846
I need another snack.

1068
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:58,114
You got the coke?

1069
01:10:58,187 --> 01:11:00,815
We fucking did it!

1070
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,619
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

1071
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:07,060
- How much did you get?
- All of it, man, everything!

1072
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,758
- You didn't hit the safe?
- Even the back bathroom, man!

1073
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:12,266
Sue, I told you we'd do it.

1074
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:15,098
<i># People say beware... #</i>

1075
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:18,662

<i>- # People say I don't care... #</i>

1076
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:23,007
<i>After they hit Eddie, they come</i>

1077

<i>about all the shit they got.</i>

1078
01:11:25,982 --> 01:11:28,974
<i>- What shit?</i>
<i>- Everything. Guns, money, drugs.</i>

1079
01:11:29,052 --> 01:11:31,077
And they're
not playing it cool, either.

1080
01:11:31,154 --> 01:11:33,952
Phone's ringing off the hook
and they keep answering it.

1081
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:37,651
-
- Hello?

1082
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:41,788
Yo, Joey, no listen to this,
you are never going to guess

1083
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:44,833
- who we just fucking nailed!
- Let me tell him, come on.

1084
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:47,165
- Guess again, motherfucker.
- Let me tell him.

1085
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:49,534
Guess again!
All right, Ronnie wants to tell you.

1086
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,539
- Eddie Nash!

1087
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:55,402
<i>You're not going to believe this shit.</i>

1088
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,844
They're telling people
that they hit Eddie Nash.

1089
01:11:57,914 --> 01:12:00,815
Can you believe that? Sitting there
passing the phone back and forth.

1090
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:03,317
- Who are they talking to?
<i>- Anyone that would listen.</i>

1091
01:12:03,386 --> 01:12:05,718
<i>Everybody that called.</i>
<i>All their scumbag customers.</i>

1092
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:09,019
<i>I said, "Ronnie, we should keep</i>
<i>a low profile. " They didn't listen.</i>

1093
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:10,855
Aaah!

1094
01:12:12,195 --> 01:12:14,561
<i># I'm gonna ah, ah,</i>

1096
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:19,094
<i># Here she comes... #</i>

1097
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:23,131
Betamax.
The Betamax-- out there.

1098
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:25,400
Man, out there, throw it.

1099
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,635
The fucking Betamax
out the fucking window.

1100

<i># Here she comes #</i>

1103
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,388
<i>How fucking stupid is that?</i>

1104
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:42,117
So I fucking split.

1105
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,886
Where'd you go?

1106
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:47,259
<i># I don't give a damn</i>

1108

1110
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:03,376
Santa Monica for a couple days.

1111
01:13:03,446 --> 01:13:05,437
Just laying low.
Then I called Eddie.

1112
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,714
You called Eddie Nash?

1113
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:11,982
<i>Yeah, I called him.</i>
<i>I was planning on leaving.</i>

1114
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:16,348
<i>I mean, I wish I had left.</i>

1115
01:13:17,427 --> 01:13:19,292
<i>What the fuck were you thinking?</i>

1116
01:13:19,362 --> 01:13:21,830
<i>Listen, I knew if I didn't call him</i>

1117
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:25,061
<i>that I'd never be able</i>
<i>to show my face here in LA again.</i>

1118
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:27,125
<i>So what did he say?</i>

1119
01:13:27,203 --> 01:13:28,898
<i>Bill, everything was cool.</i>

1120
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:31,166
Hey, it's John.

1121
01:13:31,274 --> 01:13:34,072
<i>I call him up, he doesn't mention</i>
<i>anything about the robberies.</i>

1122
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:37,374
<i>- "Come on up."</i>
- All right, I'll be there. Right on.

1123
01:13:37,447 --> 01:13:39,574
<i># Well, I stepped inside #</i>

1124
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:43,050
<i># And I stood by the door #</i>

1125
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:48,785
<i># While dark-eyed girls</i>
<i>sang and played the guitar #</i>

1126
01:13:48,858 --> 01:13:54,455

1127

<i># This was the place they called</i>
<i>Spanish Moon... #</i>

1128
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:05,863
- Johnny boy.
- What's up?

1129
01:14:07,043 --> 01:14:09,204
- Hey.
- Brother.

1130
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:12,770
- Good to see you. Where you been?
- Oh, you know, around.

1131
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:16,114
Well, I'm glad you come by.
I need a favor.

1132
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:18,745
- Sure, anything you want.
- I want you to beg.

1133
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:20,812
- What?
- I said beg, motherfucker!

1134
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:22,221
Eddie, no!

1135
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:25,889
- You think I'm stupid?
- No, Eddie!

1136
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:29,193
You think I don't figure it out?
You bring those people into my house.

1137
01:14:29,265 --> 01:14:31,995
You piece of shit.
I fucking trusted you!

1138
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:35,367
You dog! Crawl.
Crawl like dog!

1139
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:39,865
He's not crawling fast enough.
Greg, make him fly.

1140
01:14:46,249 --> 01:14:48,114
You know what they did to me?

1141
01:14:48,184 --> 01:14:50,414
You know what those motherfuckers
did to the Nash?

1142
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:54,147
You like this?
You fucking sand nigger.

1143
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:55,986
You fucking greaseball.

1144
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:59,687
I'm gonna find out who you are,
you cocksucker motherfuckers.

1145
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:01,821
I'm gonna tear
your fucking eyes out!

1146
01:15:01,898 --> 01:15:04,492
Suck this,
you sand jockey faggot.

1147
01:15:04,567 --> 01:15:07,798
Suck this. Give me
the fucking combination.

1148
01:15:09,038 --> 01:15:10,767
They handcuffed me.

1149
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:12,636
They beat my women.

1150
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,471
They dragged me upstairs.

1151
01:15:14,544 --> 01:15:16,478
They put gun in my mouth!

1152
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:19,340
How do they know
about the safe?

1153
01:15:19,415 --> 01:15:21,747
How do they know about
the Nash's safe under the bed from?

1154
01:15:23,386 --> 01:15:25,854
- You know what they did to Greg?
- Amateur motherfucker.

1155
01:15:25,922 --> 01:15:27,787
You better kill me
or cancel Christmas.

1156
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:30,792
Shut up, nigger! I'll blow your
black ass straight back to Africa.

1157
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,829
Nash, fuck these motherfuckers.
It's amateur night!

1158
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:37,059
- No witnesses.
- David, no!

1159
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:38,964
You see what they did to Greg?

1160
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:40,332
Show him, Greg.
Show him.

1161
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:45,898
They shot heroin in my bathroom.

1162
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:48,806
They cut rails on my daughter's
vanity mirror.

1163
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:50,243
On my daughter's mirror!

1164
01:15:52,448 --> 01:15:54,040
Yo, man, you want to ride this?

1165
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:56,550
No man, that shit'll kill you.

1166
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:59,986
Come on, man.
Let's fucking finish this.

1167
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:03,287
Wait a minute, they were
doing drugs during the robbery?

1168
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:04,917
Yeah.

1169
01:16:04,994 --> 01:16:08,589
- And get this, on their way out...
- John Holmes says hello!

1170
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:10,131
Whoo-hoo!

1171
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:12,326
<i>- What? What?</i>
- Yeah, he ratted me out.

1172
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:14,528
<i>Nash had been looking for me</i>
<i>for two days</i>

1173
01:16:14,637 --> 01:16:16,400
<i>so it was just dumb luck</i>
<i>I called him.</i>

1174
01:16:23,546 --> 01:16:26,106
What are we going
to do now, brother?

1175
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:29,184
Mary Holmes,

1176
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:33,211
4315 West Jefferson,
Pataskala, Ohio.

1177
01:16:33,289 --> 01:16:37,953
Sharon Holmes,
2438 West Glendale.

1178
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:42,064
You're gonna
tell me who robbed me.

1179
01:16:44,567 --> 01:16:48,469
Because if you don't--
if you don't,

1180
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:51,563
I'm going to kill every person in
that book starting with your mother,

1181
01:16:51,674 --> 01:16:56,338
your sister, your girlfriend,
that niece of yours, Gabrielle,

1182
01:16:56,412 --> 01:16:59,006
every last one of them.

1183
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:01,743
I'm going to torture them to death.

1184
01:17:03,152 --> 01:17:05,484
And while I'm doing it,
I'm going to tell them

1185
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:07,852
it's because of you.

1186
01:17:07,924 --> 01:17:09,892
And when they're dead--

1187
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:13,390
when they're dead,

1188
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:16,226
I'm going
to cut off your 14-inch cock,

1189
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:20,895
chop it up, and shove it
down your throat!

1190
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:25,171
So now you tell me...

1191
01:17:27,043 --> 01:17:29,068
who the fuck hit me?!

1192
01:17:30,713 --> 01:17:33,079
Eddie Nash has got
a gun to your knee

1193
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:36,016
and he says he's going to kill
your wife, what would you do?

1194
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:39,115
I'd tell him.

1195
01:17:39,188 --> 01:17:41,122
<i>Fucking-A right I told him.</i>

1196
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:42,487
<i>And what did he say?</i>

1197
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:49,825
You're going to do to those guys
on Wonderland

1198
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:53,266
what you did to me.

1199
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:54,996
<i>What did that mean?</i>

1200
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:58,972
Means I had to get in the car
with his dudes

1201
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:02,408
and go over and get inside
of the Wonderland house.

1202
01:18:13,923 --> 01:18:16,824
<i>- Yeah?</i>

1203
01:18:16,892 --> 01:18:18,917
It's John, man.

1204
01:18:18,995 --> 01:18:20,622
<i>What?</i>

1205
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:23,164
- It's John.

1206
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:30,801
<i># I'm counting on you #</i>

1207

1208
01:18:32,942 --> 01:18:35,342

<i>- What's up?</i>

1209
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:39,370
<i># And free my soul, I want to get lost</i>

<i># I want to get lost in your</i>

1213
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:53,456
Knock yourself out, John.

1214
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:02,801
- Good night, man.
- You cooked?

1215
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:05,271
<i># When my mind is free #</i>

1220
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,291

- See ya.

1221
01:19:29,365 --> 01:19:33,062
<i>- # I believe in your song... #</i>
<i>- Fucking unbelievable.</i>

1222
01:19:33,169 --> 01:19:37,731
<i>- # Rhythm and rhyme and harmony. #</i>
<i>- Fucking unbelievable.</i>

1223
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,070
<i>So you left the door unlocked?</i>

1224
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:42,110
Well, no.

1225
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,581
Ajar.

1226
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:51,549
Did you see Greg
or Danny go in the house?

1227
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:55,488
<i>- Did you hear anything at all?</i>

1228
01:19:56,759 --> 01:19:58,249
No.

1229
01:19:58,327 --> 01:20:00,192
What about in the street outside?

1230
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:02,457
<i>Did you see 'em in the street?</i>
<i>What about the street?</i>

1231
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:05,466
<i>Did you see 'em in the car</i>
<i>or approaching the house?</i>

1232
01:20:05,568 --> 01:20:09,004
No, I didn't see Diles,
I didn't see Greg,

1233
01:20:09,105 --> 01:20:11,573
I didn't see Eddie
after I got out of the car.

1234
01:20:11,674 --> 01:20:14,108
- Did you go back?
- Go back to Eddie's?

1235
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:17,339
No, no, no.
Did you go back to Wonderland?

1236
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,679
No.

1237
01:20:25,688 --> 01:20:26,950
You sure?

1238
01:20:29,925 --> 01:20:32,155
No, why would I go back?

1239
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:38,291
- John...
- Wait, here it comes, this is it.

1240
01:20:38,367 --> 01:20:40,528
...were you present
when the murders happened?

1241
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:43,404
No.

1242
01:20:43,472 --> 01:20:45,497
Stay on him, stay on him,
stay on him.

1243
01:20:45,608 --> 01:20:47,303
Did you see 'em murdered?

1244
01:20:48,911 --> 01:20:50,742
No.

1245
01:20:53,382 --> 01:20:56,476
Bill, are you calling me
a murderer?

1246
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,588
Come on.

1247
01:21:01,123 --> 01:21:03,216
So...

1248
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:06,489
when you left them,
they were all alive?

1249
01:21:06,562 --> 01:21:08,462
Yeah, when I left, they were alive.

1250
01:21:08,531 --> 01:21:10,556
Eddie Nash had these people killed

1251
01:21:10,633 --> 01:21:14,399
- because of a robbery you set up.
- Oh, come on, Ward.

1252
01:21:14,503 --> 01:21:16,095
Yeah.

1253
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:18,036
And you'll testify to that.

1254
01:21:18,107 --> 01:21:20,575
<i>No. Haven't you been listening?</i>

1255
01:21:20,643 --> 01:21:23,510
He is the Prince
of fucking Darkness.

1256
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:26,377
What are you talking about?
You don't know who Eddie Nash is?

1257
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:29,542
I worked Hollywood Vice for 20 years,
John, I know who Eddie Nash is.

1258
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:32,951
- What are you saying?
- How do you expect me to protect you

1259
01:21:33,022 --> 01:21:35,320
<i>if you won't go on the record?</i>

1260
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:40,488
I think-- I trust you. I think you
could protect me. I don't trust them.

1261
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,656
<i>So what do you</i>
<i>want me to tell them?</i>

1262
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,460
<i>Tell them whatever you want.</i>

1263
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:48,570
Goddamn stroke job.

1264
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:52,471
He gives us nothing. Zero.
A fat fucking doughnut.

1265
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:55,874
He doesn't finger Nash, he doesn't
even put himself at the scene.

1266
01:21:55,945 --> 01:21:58,140
The Coroner's
preliminary report indicates

1267
01:21:58,214 --> 01:21:59,772
that the murder weapons, plural,

1268
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:02,476
were probably striated lead pipes
an inch in diameter.

1269
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:06,009
They got their skulls bashed in.
Whole pieces of bone, gone.

1270
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:10,115
Three women. And that sack of shit
in there set the whole thing up.

1271
01:22:10,192 --> 01:22:12,717
I've been going there for two,
three years. Dude calls me brother.

1272
01:22:12,795 --> 01:22:15,787
He just sells out Nash and lets
somebody else do the dirty work.

1273
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:19,857
Then he gets screwed on the split.
Now he's pissed off.

1274
01:22:19,969 --> 01:22:22,460
- Johnny boy. Hey.
- What's up?

1275
01:22:22,571 --> 01:22:24,835
So he hightails
it back over to Nash's house...

1276
01:22:24,907 --> 01:22:27,967
- John, my brother.
- How are you?

1277
01:22:28,077 --> 01:22:31,808
...and rats 'em out. He handed Nash
the Wonderland gang.

1278
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:35,372
He served it up on a silver platter.
Get back, plain and simple.

1279
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:37,146
Neighbors reported hearing
loud noises...

1280
01:22:38,721 --> 01:22:42,316
...and they thought it was some kind
of primal scream therapy or something.

1281
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:44,188
It was a perfect plan, really.

1282
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:47,923
<i>There was people coming and going</i>
<i>all the time, always a party going on.</i>

1283
01:22:47,997 --> 01:22:50,625
Some loud noise at night was not
gonna raise an eyebrow.

1284
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:53,862
Exactly, but what he didn't count on
was David Lind surviving.

1285
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:57,370
It had to be Holmes.
That piece of shit ratted us out.

1286
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:59,566
Hey, I read Lind's statement.

1287
01:22:59,675 --> 01:23:02,769
He paints himself out to be an angel--
he's lying his ass off.

1288
01:23:02,845 --> 01:23:06,178
I got pushed from behind and my gun
discharged accidentally.

1289
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:08,614
We don't know if any
of his statement is even true.

1290
01:23:08,684 --> 01:23:10,618
<i>He knew who Nash was</i>
<i>the whole time.</i>

1291
01:23:10,686 --> 01:23:13,348
You take these guns up there now
or I'll cut your head off.

1292
01:23:13,422 --> 01:23:16,755
What kind of thief doesn't know who he's
hitting until the robbery itself?

1293
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,225
What fool would set up
the biggest gangster in L.A...

1294
01:23:19,295 --> 01:23:20,262
Hey, Eddie what's up?

1295
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:22,354
...and waltzes back to his house
like nothing happened?

1296
01:23:22,431 --> 01:23:24,558
- Where you been?
- Well, Eddie,

1297
01:23:24,633 --> 01:23:27,227
I got a crazy story I think you're
going to want to hear.

1298
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:30,499
David Lind is not half the liar
that cocksucker is.

1299
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:33,040
David Lind lost
the love of his life,

1300
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:35,542
and he knows
that John Holmes is responsible.

1301
01:23:35,611 --> 01:23:38,102
Now it wouldn't surprise me
at all if Holmes

1302
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,080
had planned on the murders
from the get-go.

1303
01:23:40,149 --> 01:23:43,516
- You heard his story.
- He pulls out my black book.

1304
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:46,383
He's going to kill everyone in it.
Your name's in there, Bill.

1305
01:23:46,455 --> 01:23:48,923
Fuck the black book.
The black book is a crock of shit.

1306
01:23:48,991 --> 01:23:51,391
It's a fairy tale.
He knew we were listening to him.

1307
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,587
- He didn't want to get dirty.
- Neither does Lind.

1308
01:23:53,662 --> 01:23:55,254
Four people get
their heads bashed in

1309
01:23:55,331 --> 01:23:58,198
- and there's not a single witness?

1310
01:23:58,267 --> 01:24:01,896
<i>No, no, he was in that house</i>
<i>as sure as Christ was on the cross.</i>

1311
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,165
38 sets of different prints lifted.

1312
01:24:05,274 --> 01:24:09,005
- Any one of which could be our guy.
- Including a left palm print,

1313
01:24:09,078 --> 01:24:12,206
palm down on the bedrail,
not two feet from Ron Launius' head.

1314
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:15,910
Wait at minute, are you trying to tell
me you think <i>he</i> swung the pipe?

1315
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:18,578
He was either trying
to kill him or trying to screw him.

1316
01:24:18,654 --> 01:24:21,589
Look, you read Lind's statement.
Holmes hated Launius.

1317
01:24:21,657 --> 01:24:24,319
Launius embarrassed him
in public all the time.

1318
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,588
<i>It really would not</i>
<i>surprise me in the least</i>

1319
01:24:26,662 --> 01:24:28,527
<i>if he had taken</i>
<i>a couple whacks at him.</i>

1320
01:24:28,597 --> 01:24:32,590
You know what, Sam? You can't even
tie him to the scene of the crime.

1321
01:24:32,668 --> 01:24:36,695
<i>The fact that he's got a pulse</i>
<i>ties him to the scene of the crime.</i>

1322
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:39,330
<i>He doesn't need</i>
<i>to be there, Nico.</i>

1323
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:42,103
<i>Nash knows he's terrified.</i>
<i>He'll keep his mouth shut.</i>

1324
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:44,975
<i>No, I don't buy it.</i>
<i>Nash is not an idiot.</i>

1325
01:24:45,047 --> 01:24:48,016
<i>He's certainly not going to put his</i>
<i>freedom in the hands of one.</i>

1326
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,711
<i>I've known John</i>
<i>for almost 10 years.</i>

1327
01:24:50,786 --> 01:24:54,017
<i>While I'll admit that we haven't spent</i>
<i>much time together lately,</i>

1328
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,886
<i>the John I know just isn't capable--</i>

1329
01:24:55,958 --> 01:24:57,789
I don't know who you know
or don't know.

1330
01:24:57,860 --> 01:25:01,853
All I know is that the cocksucker
in the other room there is a basehead.

1331
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:05,729
And the one thing you can always know
about a basehead

1332
01:25:05,801 --> 01:25:08,361
is that they are completely
full of shit.

1333
01:25:11,907 --> 01:25:13,397
He's dicking us around.

1334
01:25:13,509 --> 01:25:15,943
A mile of dick and no balls.

1335
01:25:16,011 --> 01:25:19,344
If he had some balls,
he'd come out and say, "I did it."

1336
01:25:19,415 --> 01:25:21,542
But he ain't gonna do that.

1337
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:23,380
It's your call.

1338
01:25:27,523 --> 01:25:31,084
Fuck it.
We gotta cut him loose.

1339
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:49,778
Hi, Sharon.
Thanks so much for--

1340
01:25:49,845 --> 01:25:52,473
- Where's Dawn?
- She's in the car, but--

1341
01:25:52,548 --> 01:25:55,312
- I want to talk to her.
- You think that's such a good idea?

1342
01:25:56,385 --> 01:25:58,148
Sharon, just be cool, okay?

1343
01:25:58,220 --> 01:25:59,585
Please.

1344
01:26:02,357 --> 01:26:05,417
- Hey.
- Oh, thank you.

1345
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:06,927
Hi.

1346
01:26:08,697 --> 01:26:11,029
- You take care of him, honey.
- I will.

1347
01:26:11,099 --> 01:26:14,068
- You take care of yourself first.
- I will.

1348
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,569
- Promise me.
- I promise.

1349
01:26:16,638 --> 01:26:19,106
Take care of this little one too.

1350
01:26:22,211 --> 01:26:24,679
- I love you.
- I love you.

1351
01:26:29,051 --> 01:26:31,611
- This is all I could get.
- Thanks so much, Sharon.

1352
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:34,656
- I'll pay you back--
- Stop lying, I can't.

1353
01:26:34,723 --> 01:26:38,625
- Sharon, I'm not lying. We'll pay--
- It's a payoff, okay?

1354
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:40,958
You should understand that term.

1355
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:43,657
I'm paying you off
to stay out of my life.

1356
01:27:36,785 --> 01:27:38,753
Sharon?

1357
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:40,549
Sharon.

1358
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:43,250
Sharon?

1359
01:27:43,325 --> 01:27:45,293
What are you doing here?

1360
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,328
I'm sorry,
I had an accident.

1361
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:51,065
I'm sorry,
can I come in please?

1362
01:27:52,134 --> 01:27:54,329
Oh my God, oh my God,
John, come in.

1363
01:27:54,436 --> 01:27:57,132
- Can you make it in?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

1364
01:27:57,239 --> 01:28:00,299
- Oh, my God. It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

1365
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:02,104
- I had an accident.
- I see that.

1366
01:28:02,177 --> 01:28:06,580
Can I have a tub?
I need a hot water tub.

1367
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:09,082
- You might need to go to a hospital.
- No.

1368
01:28:09,151 --> 01:28:11,346
- Oh, John.
- Can I please--

1369
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:15,049
- It's okay.
- I don't feel well.

1370
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:17,387
It's all right, it's okay.

1371
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:20,257
I'm going to put you
in this chair, John, okay?

1372
01:28:20,329 --> 01:28:22,627
I'm just going
to put you in this chair.

1373
01:28:22,698 --> 01:28:25,166
Sit down.

1374
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:27,599
Could you fill the tub
with water, please?

1375
01:28:27,703 --> 01:28:29,796
- It's not really going good out here.
- Okay.

1376
01:28:29,905 --> 01:28:33,033
- Please. Okay.
- Stay with me.

1377
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:34,972
- No. No.
- You're in shock.

1378
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:38,342
- I have to check you out.
- No, please make a tub of hot water.

1379
01:28:38,413 --> 01:28:40,938
I need to get--
Sharon, put the water in the tub!

1380
01:28:41,016 --> 01:28:43,211
I'm sorry.

1381
01:28:43,285 --> 01:28:45,219
Hot water.

1382
01:28:45,287 --> 01:28:47,414
- Stay calm.
- Okay.

1383
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:51,352
Oh God,
you have a head injury.

1384
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:54,224
I'm sorry I yelled, but--

1385
01:28:54,296 --> 01:28:56,287
John?

1386
01:28:56,865 --> 01:28:57,854
Easy.

1387
01:28:58,934 --> 01:29:00,526
Okay, easy.

1388
01:29:01,737 --> 01:29:02,999
All right, John.

1389
01:29:04,373 --> 01:29:06,671
I'm okay.
I'm getting in now.

1390
01:29:06,742 --> 01:29:09,575
Okay, hot, hot.

1391
01:29:09,645 --> 01:29:12,375
John, close your eyes 'cause
this could sting if it gets in.

1392
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:16,650
I'm homesick.

1393
01:29:16,718 --> 01:29:18,515
Where's the cut?

1394
01:29:18,587 --> 01:29:20,885
There's too much blood.
I gotta get it off, okay?

1395
01:29:20,956 --> 01:29:23,390
- John, where's the wound?
- Give me more warm water.

1396
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:26,518
<i>- Like a firework--</i>
<i>- Where's the wound? There's no wound.</i>

1397
01:29:26,595 --> 01:29:29,120
This isn't your blood, John.

1398
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:31,825
Whose blood is this?

1399
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:36,428
I need a sponge, 'cause it don't come--
you have to really scrub.

1400
01:29:36,538 --> 01:29:38,699
- John, John!
- What?

1401
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,508
What happened, John?

1402
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:46,547
<i>Five people are dead, Sharon.</i>

1403
01:29:46,615 --> 01:29:49,175
They were murdered.

1404
01:29:49,251 --> 01:29:51,412
<i>Up on Wonderland.</i>

1405
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:56,446
They shouldn't have done that to him.
They humiliated him-- to the Nash.

1406
01:29:56,525 --> 01:29:59,085
They were so stupid.

1407
01:29:59,161 --> 01:30:02,460
- I'm not following this, John.
<i>- He had my book.</i>

1408
01:30:02,531 --> 01:30:05,193
He had my black book.

1409
01:30:05,267 --> 01:30:07,235
He had everyone's name in it.

1410
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:09,326
He said he was going to kill you.

1411
01:30:09,438 --> 01:30:11,463
So I told him
I couldn't let that happen.

1412
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:15,839
So then they went up to Wonderland.
They made me go there.

1413
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:17,845
<i>I did it for us, Sharon.</i>

1414
01:30:17,913 --> 01:30:20,177
He had your name in there--
he said he was going to kill you.

1415
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:22,239
What did you do for us?

1416
01:30:22,317 --> 01:30:24,217
I had to, Sharon--
I had no choice.

1417
01:30:24,286 --> 01:30:27,813
Oh, there's so much blood.
Ron's head was like a firework.

1418
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:30,289
I saw inside his head.

1419
01:30:30,358 --> 01:30:32,986
It just opened like a grapefruit.

1420
01:30:34,062 --> 01:30:38,055
What did you do, John?
What did you do, John?

1421
01:30:43,572 --> 01:30:46,871
I left before anything happened.

1422
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:49,137
<i>I don't understand,</i>
<i>what'd you--</i>

1423
01:30:49,211 --> 01:30:51,179
what did you do?!

1424
01:30:51,246 --> 01:30:54,010
I left before anything happened.

1425
01:30:57,719 --> 01:31:00,210
But, I-- I never-- Sharon, I--

1426
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:02,313
No, I don't want to know. No.

1427
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:05,052
- Sharon--
- I don't want to know. No.

1428
01:31:05,127 --> 01:31:07,391
<i>You need to get out.</i>
<i>You need to leave.</i>

1429
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:10,090
<i>No, I want you</i>
<i>out of my house.</i>

1430
01:31:10,165 --> 01:31:13,760
- I want you to leave.
- Okay. Fine.

1431
01:31:13,869 --> 01:31:15,962
You don't understand anyway.

1432
01:31:16,071 --> 01:31:19,063
- I understand, I understand.
- What your husband had to do--

1433
01:31:19,174 --> 01:31:21,074
You brought filth into my life again!

1434
01:31:21,143 --> 01:31:22,633
Filth?
You wanna know what filth is?

1435
01:31:22,744 --> 01:31:26,475
What your husband had to do to survive
down at Peanuts with those faggots.

1436
01:31:26,548 --> 01:31:28,448
- You're not my fucking husband!
<i>- Really?</i>

1437
01:31:28,517 --> 01:31:30,212
- You're a gigolo.
- Oh, really?

1438
01:31:30,285 --> 01:31:32,810
No, I'm Johnny-fucking-Wadd!

1439
01:31:32,888 --> 01:31:34,685
<i>That's what I am, huh?</i>

1440
01:31:34,756 --> 01:31:36,917
You know what they wanted
up at Wonderland?

1441
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:38,755
What Eddie wanted?

1442
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:41,660
<i>That thing, that thing-- that thing that</i>
<i>makes me a star, Sharon.</i>

1443
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:43,630
<i>Look at me.</i>
<i>Any idea what it's like?</i>

1444
01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:46,895
- What <i>thing</i> are you talking about?
- This thing! This fucking thing!

1445
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:48,595
Everybody wants
and nobody can have.

1446
01:31:48,703 --> 01:31:52,104
- Do you remember when you loved it?
- That went away a long time ago.

1447
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:54,699
- A long time ago.
- You left me!

1448
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:56,437
- Bullshit.
- That is not bullshit!

1449
01:31:56,511 --> 01:32:00,413
That's bullshit, John. You left me!
Then we can stop arguing.

1450
01:32:00,482 --> 01:32:03,144
You left me that day
in the bathroom.

1451
01:32:03,218 --> 01:32:05,277
You chose that thing over me.

1452
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,878
That disgusting thing
that makes me sick.

1453
01:32:07,956 --> 01:32:10,390
<i>I'm not nobody, Sharon.</i>
<i>I'm a star.</i>

1454
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:12,392
<i>- You are a whore, John.</i>
<i>- Oh, really, yeah?</i>

1455
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:15,088
I'm a survivor, Sharon!
I'm scum?

1456
01:32:15,163 --> 01:32:17,154
I'm filth? I'm alive.

1457
01:32:17,232 --> 01:32:20,224
And those people at Wonderland?
They'll never laugh at me again.

1458
01:32:20,335 --> 01:32:23,395
They got theirs with a lead pipe,
and I'm still here surviving.

1459
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:46,457
<i>You know, this case</i>
<i>could make our careers.</i>

1460
01:32:46,528 --> 01:32:48,291
<i>This case could end our careers.</i>

1461
01:32:48,363 --> 01:32:51,093
Nobody's going to back us
against Nash without an eyewitness.

1462
01:32:51,166 --> 01:32:53,225
I talked to Nimziki this morning.

1463
01:32:53,335 --> 01:32:55,997
- Nash is untouchable until November.
- Shit.

1464
01:32:56,104 --> 01:32:59,039
- Who's dick's Nimziki sucking?
- Everybody's.

1465
01:32:59,107 --> 01:33:02,304
It's a goddamn swordfight
in there. All right?

1466
01:33:17,058 --> 01:33:19,822
Ms. Launius?

1467
01:33:19,895 --> 01:33:22,796
- Can she hear us?
- I don't know.

1468
01:33:32,007 --> 01:33:34,805
Goddamn it, Ron, you told me it was
going to be different this time.

1469
01:33:34,876 --> 01:33:37,344
I don't want to start like this!
Come here.

1470
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:39,470
- Goddamn it.
- Come here.

1471
01:33:39,547 --> 01:33:41,947
<i>Ms. Launius?</i>

1472
01:33:43,218 --> 01:33:45,516
Can you hear me?

1473
01:33:45,587 --> 01:33:47,817
I need you.

1474
01:33:47,889 --> 01:33:50,255
- I need you here.
- Goddamn it.

1475
01:33:50,325 --> 01:33:52,589
Baby, I'm going crazy down here.

1476
01:33:52,661 --> 01:33:55,061
Come on, come on.

1477
01:34:06,675 --> 01:34:10,008
- That didn't last long, did it?
- Fuck you.

1478
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:31,299
Can you tell me anything about
what happened to you?

1479
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:45,502
Shadows.

1480
01:34:47,148 --> 01:34:49,082
Shadows, shadows.

1481
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,197
<i>- What did she say?</i>
<i>- Nothing.</i>

1482
01:35:37,499 --> 01:35:39,433
- Yeah?
<i>- It's John, man.</i>

1483
01:35:39,501 --> 01:35:42,061
- Holmes, no.
<i>- Come on, let me in, it's John.</i>

1484
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:45,139
- No.

1485
01:36:02,957 --> 01:36:06,723
Look! Look!
Stop it, John!

1486
01:36:15,570 --> 01:36:18,164
Stop it, John! Stop it, John!

1487
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:20,241
Look, you motherfucker!

1488
01:36:20,308 --> 01:36:23,800
Look at her motherfucking head bust.
Are you looking at this, Johnny?

1489
01:36:23,912 --> 01:36:26,346
Look what you did,
look what the fuck you did.

1490
01:36:26,414 --> 01:36:29,144
You're a bad man, Johnny!
You want to fuck with me?

1491
01:36:29,217 --> 01:36:30,809
Let's go.

1492
01:36:41,729 --> 01:36:43,492
It's your turn, baby.

1493
01:36:43,565 --> 01:36:45,032
It's Christmas.

1494
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:47,398
Let's go to work, Johnny.
Let's go to work, baby.

1495
01:36:47,502 --> 01:36:49,470
<i>Let's go to work, baby.</i>
<i>Let's go to work.</i>

1496
01:36:49,537 --> 01:36:51,505
<i>- Let's get dirty, Johnny.</i>
- No.

1497
01:36:51,573 --> 01:36:54,064
<i>Let's go!</i>
<i>Let's get dirty, Johnny.</i>

1498
01:36:54,175 --> 01:36:56,200
<i>Let's get dirty, Johnny!</i>

1499
01:36:56,311 --> 01:36:58,279
<i>Hit that motherfucker!</i>

1500
01:36:58,346 --> 01:37:00,314
That's right, that's right!

1501
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:04,581
<i>Hit him. Hit him.</i>
<i>Look at you.</i>

1502
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:07,815
<i>Look at you. Oh, man.</i>

1503
01:37:07,889 --> 01:37:09,516
<i>Johnny's doing a movie.</i>

1504
01:37:21,402 --> 01:37:23,870
- Another bad dream, baby?
- No.

1505
01:37:26,307 --> 01:37:28,571
Um...

1506
01:37:28,643 --> 01:37:30,338
what time is it?

6:00.

1508

Morning or evening?

1509
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:38,580
Morning.

1510
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:43,617
Didn't I promise
I'd get you out of there?

1511
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:45,591
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Didn't I?

1512
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:47,594
- Didn't I?
- Mm-hmm.

1513
01:37:47,662 --> 01:37:49,425
Who's my girl?

1514
01:37:49,497 --> 01:37:51,727
I'm your girl.

1517
01:38:15,056 --> 01:38:19,083
