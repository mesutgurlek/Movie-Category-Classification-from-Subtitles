1
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:58,488
I said, ''Look, Iady, the seats haven't
gotten smaIIer...

2
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,495
...your ass has gotten bigger.''

3
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:49,578
I'm sorry, sir. This cabin is
restricted to first cIass.

4
00:01:49,917 --> 00:01:51,851
Are you Iooking for this?

5
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:55,689
Can I get you anything?

6
00:01:56,024 --> 00:01:59,687
Scotch. BIended. Straight.

7
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,421
This is your captain speaking.

8
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:08,600
We았e got a report
ofsome turbulence ahead.

9
00:02:08,936 --> 00:02:13,270
Please return to yourseats
and fasten yourseat belts...

10
00:02:13,608 --> 00:02:17,942
...and remain there until we release
the fasten-your-seat-belt sign.

11
00:02:26,454 --> 00:02:28,945
I hear birds can't fIy this high.

12
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,385
I hear onIy angeIs can.

13
00:02:38,232 --> 00:02:39,790
Where's the bomb?

14
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:43,061
I am the bomb.

15
00:02:46,074 --> 00:02:49,976
-ShaII I pour your scotch?
-No, I'II take the bottIe.

16
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,152
Another movie from an oId TV show.

17
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:03,150
What are you gonna do?

18
00:03:05,993 --> 00:03:07,324
WaIk out.

19
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:09,652
Very funny.

20
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:11,629
No, it isn't.

21
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,661
What are you doing?!

22
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:17,493
What are you doing?! Get off of me!

23
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:45,031
HeIp me! HeIp me!

24
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:50,400
HeIp me! Be carefuI!

25
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:31,502
Nice fIight?

26
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:55,992
You crazy bastard!

27
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,830
I think you mean ''crazy bitch.''

28
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,842
What is this?
What's going on here?

29
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,178
Damn, I hate to fIy.

30
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,847
No way! No way!

31
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,180
What's with that?!
Who are you peopIe?!

32
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,516
Who are you peopIe?!

33
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:28,192
Once upon a time, there were three
very different little girls.

34
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,722
...who grew up to be
three very different women.

35
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:02,729
--making her a five-day champion.
Way to go, NataIie.

36
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:07,063
They have three things in common:
Theyre brilliant, beautiful...

37
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,399
I'm going to be aII over you!

38
00:06:09,644 --> 00:06:11,976
You wiII be kissing my ass--

39
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:16,242
...and they work forme.

40
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,745
My name is Charlie.

41
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:33,596
-Let's go this way.
-No!

42
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:34,933
This way!

43
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,434
Wait. I'm not a yo-yo!

44
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,635
Good morning, Starfish.

45
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,307
Good morning, Chad.

46
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,475
Sweet Chad.

47
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:21,637
I figured we couId have a IittIe
breakfast.

48
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,474
And then, maybe, after...

49
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,651
...we couId have a IittIe Chad.

50
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:33,390
HoId that thought.

51
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,661
Yes, I'II be right in.

52
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:47,163
Isn't that just the Iuck?

53
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,305
I can make something besides eggs.

54
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,035
No, it's not the eggs.

55
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,677
Is it the boat?

56
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,507
It's not the boat. I have to go.

57
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:00,744
Is it the Chad?

58
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,514
It might be the Chad.

59
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,354
It's the Chad!

60
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,528
It's the Chad!

61
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:19,866
Eduardo, move me.

62
00:09:40,187 --> 00:09:41,119
Good morning.

63
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:45,114
I signed the waiver, so feeI free
to stick things in my sIot.

64
00:09:49,296 --> 00:09:50,627
Thanks.

65
00:09:50,898 --> 00:09:52,126
No probIem.

66
00:09:57,238 --> 00:09:59,706
Hey! I'II be right in.

67
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:04,734
l want to get one thing straight
between us.

68
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,642
Go ahead. Were past keeping secrets
at this point.

69
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,747
This is going to be long...

70
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:13,747
...hard and rough.

71
00:10:14,922 --> 00:10:17,914
Sometimes when it's rough,
I just get there faster.

72
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:22,753
If you don't defuse this bomb,
L.A. wiII be an underwater attraction.

73
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:26,097
Which wire?
The red one or the bIue one?

74
00:10:28,102 --> 00:10:29,763
That is not heIping.

75
00:10:30,104 --> 00:10:31,765
Ooh, my muffins.

76
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:36,269
This is stupid, anyway.
Why wouIdn't I just yank the wire?

77
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,444
They're dummy wires, honey.
The reaI mechanism is inside.

78
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:44,444
Trip the externaI feedback circuit,
the bomb wiII detonate.

79
00:10:45,619 --> 00:10:47,610
Wow.

80
00:10:48,455 --> 00:10:52,289
For a bikini waxer,
you know a Iot about bombs.

81
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:00,362
Isn't it amazing how much information
you can Iearn off the Internet?

82
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,037
I'II be right there.

83
00:11:14,148 --> 00:11:16,378
When do I get to meet this CharIie?

84
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,982
CharIie's not a very sociaI person.

85
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:22,315
But CharIie's a chick though, right?

86
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:27,324
I mean, definiteIy a woman, right?

87
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:33,994
l can앖 keep up this fa網de
with Jason anymore.

88
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:37,395
Who wants a man who압 intimidated
by a strong woman?

89
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:42,506
They come on nice untiI they find out
I can shatter a bIock with my head.

90
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,971
I Iove that trick.

91
00:11:44,178 --> 00:11:45,736
BIueberry muffins.

92
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:48,004
I made them from scratch.

93
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:52,349
Yum.

94
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,917
Sounds good.

95
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:56,853
These Iook great, AIex.

96
00:11:57,524 --> 00:11:58,855
Oh, my God.

97
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:10,596
What's this?

98
00:12:11,038 --> 00:12:12,528
Chinese fighting muffin.

99
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,539
Nothing to Iaugh about.

100
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:20,213
My buddy took a fighting muffin in the
chest, he went home in 4 ZipIoc bags.

101
00:12:20,547 --> 00:12:24,039
They're not Chinese. They're not
fighting. They're bIueberry.

102
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:27,876
Are you okay?

103
00:12:28,088 --> 00:12:30,613
She's having secret-identity troubIe.

104
00:12:30,891 --> 00:12:31,880
Aren't we aII?

105
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:33,386
Scoot.

106
00:12:37,064 --> 00:12:38,395
AIex...

107
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:40,563
...aII my AngeIs...

108
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,236
...the heart is a muscIe.

109
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:48,063
In bodybuiIding,
we exercise the muscIe...

110
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,903
...and it grows bigger and stronger.

111
00:12:51,211 --> 00:12:53,304
It's the same with the heart.

112
00:12:53,514 --> 00:12:55,243
I must have the heart of a rhino.

113
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:57,914
You do. Be proud of it.

114
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:02,415
Mes Anges...

115
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:04,417
...these IittIe hurts wiII heaI.

116
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:09,756
And at crunch time,
your hearts wiII be so buff...

117
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:13,089
...you'II be abIe to cIean
and jerk his Iove...

118
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:15,925
...three sets, 1 0 reps each.

119
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,931
Thanks, Bos.

120
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:22,936
Excuse me.
I have to take a phone caII.

121
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:28,582
Good morning, Angels.

122
00:13:28,582 --> 00:13:29,776
Good morning, Angels.

123
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:31,448
Good morning, CharIie.

124
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:36,019
Dylan, Alex, Natalie, l hope youre
ready foryournext assignment.

125
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:42,452
Meet Eric Knox, a brilliant engineer
and founder ofKnox Technologies...

126
00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:46,129
...an up-and-coming communications
software company.

127
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:48,628
Last night, Knox was kidnapped...

128
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,804
...and his voice-identification
software was stolen.

129
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:57,140
Who's the Iady?

130
00:13:57,478 --> 00:14:00,811
Vivian Wood,
president ofKnox Technologies.

131
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,538
Oh, she did it.

132
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:05,776
I guess we can aII go home then.

133
00:14:05,986 --> 00:14:09,478
AngeIs, meet Vivian Wood,
our new cIient.

134
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,385
She's hired us to find Eric Knox.

135
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,658
HeIIo.

136
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,386
Who'd have the most to gain
from Knox's disappearance?

137
00:14:17,664 --> 00:14:19,894
Me, probabIy. I'm his partner.

138
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:22,492
Before we were partners...

139
00:14:23,337 --> 00:14:24,827
...we were friends.

140
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:27,497
Does Knox have any enemies?

141
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:29,832
Roger Corwin. He압 owner...

142
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:34,673
...ofRed Star, the largest
communications satellite firm.

143
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,748
Six months ago,
he tried to buy Knox TechnoIogies.

144
00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:40,680
When Knox refused to seII,
Corwin Iost it.

145
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:42,010
Charming.

146
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,587
Was there a ransom demand?

147
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,360
Nothing. But I know he's stiII aIive.

148
00:14:47,694 --> 00:14:50,857
I'II study the garage footage.
Something may be there.

149
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,191
So Corwin is our onIy Iead.
HopefuIIy, he'II take us to Knox.

150
00:14:55,536 --> 00:15:00,030
Corwin gets a weekly massage
at Madame Wong압 House ofBlossoms.

151
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:03,537
That압 our chance to feel him out.

152
00:15:04,044 --> 00:15:05,705
He said what?

153
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:08,704
''Over my dead body''?

154
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:12,048
I can accept those terms.

155
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:18,548
It's getting a IittIe chiIIy in here,
Yoko. I couId use some warming up.

156
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:23,552
At your service.

157
00:15:23,897 --> 00:15:25,057
Good.

158
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:28,558
CouId we get started this miIIennium?

159
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:32,398
Banzai!

160
00:15:37,578 --> 00:15:39,239
Ooh, yeah.

161
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,141
You're hoIding a Iot of tension...

162
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,407
...in your 4th and 5th vertebrae.

163
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:45,640
I know.

164
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,581
Let me see if I can work that...

165
00:15:50,591 --> 00:15:51,922
...out.

166
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:59,255
By activating the right energy points,
you can increase circuIation...

167
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:02,925
...aIIeviate pain...

168
00:16:03,604 --> 00:16:05,435
...or even...

169
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:09,665
...render a man unconscious.

170
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:28,454
Okay, Iet's go.

171
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:34,464
PaIm PiIot.

172
00:16:41,508 --> 00:16:42,998
Got the car key.

173
00:16:45,979 --> 00:16:47,810
I got his scheduIe.

174
00:16:58,158 --> 00:17:00,149
You must have dozed off.

175
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:02,488
You're very good...

176
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,997
...with your hands.

177
00:17:05,832 --> 00:17:08,665
I couId use someone
Iike you on my staff.

178
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:14,163
Thanks for the offer, but my hands
aren't going anywhere near your staff.

179
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,144
If Corwin is behind Knox's
disappearance...

180
00:17:23,483 --> 00:17:26,418
...someone eIse
is doing his dirty work.

181
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:37,296
How's it coming
with the kidnapping footage?

182
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:40,657
I'm enhancing a refIection
from the car window.

183
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:46,699
May l take your order?.

184
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,374
Three cheeseburgers, three
French fries and three cherry pies.

185
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,943
What do you guys want?

186
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:57,443
Here's one of the kidnappers.

187
00:17:57,718 --> 00:17:59,379
Creepy Thin Man.

188
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,381
Now we just Iook for him.

189
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:03,451
And see if he works for Corwin.

190
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:05,055
What's Corwin doing tonight?

191
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,055
Who's up for crashing a party?

192
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,414
Bos.

193
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:33,743
-Thanks, Nat.
-No probIem.

194
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:37,747
It's a mic-transmitter.
Put it on your back moIar.

195
00:18:38,091 --> 00:18:39,752
I know. It's a mouth-mic.

196
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,325
We'II be abIe to aIways stay in touch.

197
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:51,936
We're in deep cover now, so if...

198
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:57,107
...you can't remember John David,
just caII me J.D. Think of....

199
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,006
-JeIIy doughnut.
-Jack DanieIs.

200
00:19:00,447 --> 00:19:03,109
-JuveniIe deIinquents.
-John DeLorean.

201
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,022
There's your date, J.D.

202
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,451
Excuse me, Iadies.

203
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:20,793
Roger Corwin. WeIcome.

204
00:19:21,134 --> 00:19:23,796
John David Rage, seIf-heIp guru.

205
00:19:24,137 --> 00:19:26,128
John David Rage?

206
00:19:26,473 --> 00:19:28,634
Relax, Bos. Ordera drink.

207
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:31,304
Excuse me. Miss?

208
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:33,544
Hi...miss.

209
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:35,805
-A hammerhead, please.
-No problem.

210
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,709
Any creepy thin men?

211
00:19:40,153 --> 00:19:42,053
Lots of creepy, none thin.

212
00:19:42,322 --> 00:19:43,983
-I was wondering if--
-No.

213
00:19:44,324 --> 00:19:47,054
-So there's no chance--
-No.

214
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:57,000
That's incredibIe.

215
00:19:57,337 --> 00:19:58,326
What is?

216
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,437
Your smiIe.

217
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:03,337
Thanks.

218
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:09,046
This pIace, it's Japanese, is it not?

219
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:11,612
It's a 1 3th-century Shinto tempIe.

220
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:13,783
I had it....

221
00:20:14,554 --> 00:20:17,045
I had it FedEx'd from Kyoto.

222
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,721
BIowfish?

223
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,290
Isn't that poisonous?

224
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,554
It's a rare deIicacy for the man who
has no fear of an excruciating death.

225
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:30,229
TechnicaIIy, 1 in 60 is fataI.

226
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:42,070
Tastes Iike chicken.

227
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,248
That wouId go
very niceIy with broccoIi.

228
00:20:47,587 --> 00:20:49,248
The man Iaughs at death.

229
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:53,252
Good work, Bos.
Get him to taIk about Knox.

230
00:20:53,593 --> 00:20:56,426
At Iast, a worthy adversary.

231
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,661
Let's see if you can survive
a test of intuition and judgment.

232
00:21:06,773 --> 00:21:09,606
Nat, that bartender is cute.

233
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:11,341
I'm working.

234
00:21:11,545 --> 00:21:14,537
He Iikes you.
Go back and fIirt a IittIe.

235
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:21,413
That was fast.

236
00:21:21,755 --> 00:21:24,315
I'm not caIIed BaIIs-Out NataIie
for nothing.

237
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,919
Right.

238
00:21:28,094 --> 00:21:29,823
I never saw you working here before.

239
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:33,827
I'm new. I'm Iike a virgin.
I mean, it's my first time...

240
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,329
...here at Corwin's.

241
00:21:38,271 --> 00:21:40,933
Oh, boy. She's going down.

242
00:21:41,274 --> 00:21:43,105
No way. He's into her.

243
00:21:43,443 --> 00:21:46,276
Justpick up the tray and walk away.

244
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,613
No, no. Stay. Stay and taIk to him.

245
00:21:50,784 --> 00:21:52,445
FIip your hair.

246
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,111
FIip your goddamn hair.

247
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:13,970
Excuse me. I don't usuaIIy do this,
but I was wondering--

248
00:22:14,307 --> 00:22:16,969
UnIess you're aIready
seeing someone eIse.

249
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,208
Yeah.

250
00:22:18,478 --> 00:22:19,877
-Of course you are.
-No!

251
00:22:20,146 --> 00:22:21,545
I'm not seeing anyone.

252
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,881
Free.

253
00:22:25,318 --> 00:22:27,980
Okay, Thursday?

254
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,211
My favorite day.

255
00:22:30,657 --> 00:22:32,318
Great. I'II get tickets.

256
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,651
I Iove tickets.

257
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:37,486
What do you know?
A guy who speaks NataIie.

258
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:38,889
Where's J.D.?

259
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:11,820
WiII somebody heIp me up, pIease?

260
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:14,556
HeIIo, girIs? Are you hearing me?

261
00:23:22,876 --> 00:23:24,207
Thin Man, 1 0:00.

262
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:03,576
Why do they aIways run?

263
00:24:39,986 --> 00:24:40,975
Watch it!

264
00:24:52,966 --> 00:24:53,796
Nat!

265
00:25:04,511 --> 00:25:05,341
Brace!

266
00:25:05,812 --> 00:25:06,574
Jump!

267
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:00,948
Check them aII!

268
00:27:08,735 --> 00:27:09,895
-CIear!
-CIear!

269
00:27:10,136 --> 00:27:11,228
CIear!

270
00:27:39,098 --> 00:27:40,087
Knox.

271
00:27:42,602 --> 00:27:45,594
Great work, Angels,
but ourjob압 only half-finished.

272
00:27:45,939 --> 00:27:49,340
There압 still the matter
ofMr. Knox압 stolen technology.

273
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:52,508
What's so speciaI about your software?

274
00:27:53,613 --> 00:27:56,946
It's.... It's reaIIy quite amazing.

275
00:27:57,283 --> 00:28:01,617
We deveIoped a program. You see,
everyone's voice is unique.

276
00:28:01,955 --> 00:28:03,616
It has a unique signature...

277
00:28:03,957 --> 00:28:07,791
...Iike a snowfIake.
And it can be mapped--

278
00:28:08,127 --> 00:28:13,030
Audio DNA. It makes it impossibIe to
disguise or scrambIe a voice signaI.

279
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:15,631
Which is why Corwin wants it.

280
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:20,635
Of course. AII Red Star's sateIIites
have gIobaI positioning systems.

281
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,634
Combine that
with voice identification--

282
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:26,538
--any ceII phone couId be a homing
device.

283
00:28:26,813 --> 00:28:28,212
No one couId hide.

284
00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:31,973
Imagine how dangerous this wouId be
in the wrong hands.

285
00:28:32,218 --> 00:28:33,207
The end of privacy.

286
00:28:33,486 --> 00:28:35,545
That압 where you come in, Angels.

287
00:28:35,788 --> 00:28:39,189
Corwin is premiering his Red Star
racerat the California Speedway.

288
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:42,690
Our chance to pIant
a hidden camera on Corwin.

289
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:45,294
Looks like it압 off to the races,
Angels.

290
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:49,958
When Roger Corwin first got
invoIved in the worId of racing...

291
00:28:50,303 --> 00:28:54,967
...a Iot of peopIe said it was
a stopgap for my waning Iibido.

292
00:28:55,475 --> 00:28:57,466
I had them aII fired.

293
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,680
What's so funny? I did.

294
00:29:04,484 --> 00:29:07,146
Thanks for coming
to this IittIe test run.

295
00:29:16,562 --> 00:29:17,551
Nat...

296
00:29:18,698 --> 00:29:19,687
...I'm going in.

297
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:22,857
But what can I say?

298
00:29:23,202 --> 00:29:25,500
It's a Red Star day for me.

299
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,672
Then it's back
to the day-to-day grind...

300
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:33,172
...of worId domination
and ensIavement.

301
00:29:41,354 --> 00:29:42,685
Hi.

302
00:29:50,396 --> 00:29:51,886
Work your magic.

303
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:59,360
It's hot out there.

304
00:30:03,209 --> 00:30:05,200
It's hot in here too.

305
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:09,107
Maybe I can make
you more comfortabIe.

306
00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:21,387
Oh, I've come undone.

307
00:30:23,896 --> 00:30:25,227
That feeIs good.

308
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,598
Thank you.

309
00:30:35,074 --> 00:30:36,905
I Iike what you've done with it.

310
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:41,137
Ours has bigger mirrors.

311
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,081
I Iove cars.

312
00:30:51,324 --> 00:30:52,757
You Iike fast cars?

313
00:30:57,764 --> 00:31:00,096
I Iike fast everything.

314
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:04,258
Oh, my God.

315
00:31:08,007 --> 00:31:09,338
Thanks for the ride.

316
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:10,940
You're weIcome.

317
00:31:18,017 --> 00:31:22,351
Mission accompIished. Tomorrow,
Corwin wiII give us a tour of Red Star.

318
00:31:22,955 --> 00:31:25,788
Ride 'em, cowboy. Make me proud.

319
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:07,329
Nat!

320
00:32:08,668 --> 00:32:09,828
What압 going on?

321
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:11,730
We got a friend on the track.

322
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:13,699
That creep from Chinatown.

323
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,872
Creepy Thin Man.

324
00:32:27,553 --> 00:32:29,885
It's a round track.
He's not going anywhere.

325
00:32:54,313 --> 00:32:55,974
She's going after him.

326
00:34:22,902 --> 00:34:26,895
The microcamera has allowed us
to study Red Star압 layout.

327
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:30,006
The mainframe is right behind
that door.

328
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:34,507
That's where my software wouId be,
but the security Iooks incredibIe.

329
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:36,648
-Restricted access.
-Fingerprint I.D.

330
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:38,077
RetinaI scanner.

331
00:34:38,517 --> 00:34:40,508
Angels, break it down.

332
00:34:40,853 --> 00:34:43,686
OnIy two Red Star directors
can access the mainframe.

333
00:34:44,023 --> 00:34:48,084
To gain access, they have
to synchronize their entrance.

334
00:34:50,696 --> 00:34:54,188
A geIatin scanning pIate
takes exact fingerprints.

335
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:58,363
A Iaser accurate to .009 miIIimeters
scans the retina.

336
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:07,535
It is accessibIe onIy through
a monitored airIess antechamber.

337
00:35:10,016 --> 00:35:14,919
There's onIy one way to get through
undetected: Be invisibIe.

338
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:22,391
The fIoor is rigged
with pressure sensitivity.

339
00:35:22,628 --> 00:35:26,120
Any contact exceeding .25 seconds
triggers the aIarm.

340
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:30,132
Sounds impossibIe.

341
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,731
Sounds Iike fun.

342
00:35:43,282 --> 00:35:45,944
Director 1

343
00:36:36,836 --> 00:36:38,895
Director 2

344
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,302
Mein Siegenbock ist sexy!

345
00:36:52,485 --> 00:36:54,476
They got the wrong address.

346
00:37:28,854 --> 00:37:31,687
You ready to whip them into shape,
Alex?

347
00:37:47,873 --> 00:37:50,307
You must be Miss Aarons. I'm Doris.

348
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,041
Sorry about the confusion.

349
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:57,305
I had you scheduIed for next week.
I don't know what happened.

350
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,148
That's what I'm here to find out.

351
00:38:00,553 --> 00:38:02,487
You are the efficiency expert.

352
00:38:02,721 --> 00:38:04,052
Yes.

353
00:38:04,723 --> 00:38:06,054
I am.

354
00:38:07,226 --> 00:38:08,158
Bitch.

355
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:10,392
I heard that.

356
00:38:18,737 --> 00:38:22,571
Your methodoIogies are antiquated
and weak.

357
00:38:22,908 --> 00:38:27,242
Your procedures of approvaI ensure
that onIy the Ieast radicaI ideas...

358
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,411
...are rewarded.

359
00:38:29,748 --> 00:38:32,911
MeanwhiIe, your competition is
innovating!

360
00:38:36,088 --> 00:38:37,248
Ow.

361
00:38:40,092 --> 00:38:41,252
You.

362
00:38:42,761 --> 00:38:45,195
What was the Iast
suggestion you made?

363
00:38:46,765 --> 00:38:48,756
To make the Coke machine free.

364
00:38:49,034 --> 00:38:50,092
Why?

365
00:38:50,436 --> 00:38:52,427
Caffeine heIps us program.

366
00:38:55,774 --> 00:38:57,935
Perfect. Smart...

367
00:38:58,611 --> 00:39:01,273
...simpIe and IogicaI.

368
00:39:02,948 --> 00:39:04,381
What did your boss say?

369
00:39:06,118 --> 00:39:07,779
He said no.

370
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:10,953
Question!

371
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,221
Who buiIds this company's products?

372
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,959
You do.

373
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,121
Engineers do.

374
00:39:21,634 --> 00:39:23,625
Not managers.

375
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:29,304
They shouId be answering to you,
not you to them!

376
00:39:30,476 --> 00:39:33,809
Who eIse has an idea
Iike this man's Coke machine?

377
00:39:34,313 --> 00:39:36,474
AII right! TeII me.

378
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,580
Better yet...

379
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:41,976
...can anyone show me?

380
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,151
Red Star Mainframe LeveI 4

381
00:40:34,673 --> 00:40:35,731
It's not working.

382
00:41:08,874 --> 00:41:13,607
There압 only one way to get through
undetected: Be invisible.

383
00:41:28,627 --> 00:41:31,061
The flooris rigged
with pressure sensitivity.

384
00:41:31,296 --> 00:41:35,392
Any contact which exceeds .25 seconds
will trigger the alarm.

385
00:41:57,489 --> 00:41:58,820
Thank you, sir.

386
00:42:14,006 --> 00:42:16,998
I hope you don't mind
if we Iook around.

387
00:42:43,702 --> 00:42:46,694
So we have compIete access
to Red Star's computer.

388
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:49,701
And they have no idea
we can peek inside.

389
00:42:49,975 --> 00:42:52,205
You guys are tremendous. Thanks.

390
00:42:53,712 --> 00:42:58,547
I need evidence of Knox TechnoIogies
software in the Red Star system.

391
00:42:58,817 --> 00:43:02,218
-Where is it?
-BosIey has it in the Iaptop.

392
00:43:02,488 --> 00:43:05,218
It has a direct Iink
to the Red Star mainframe.

393
00:43:05,657 --> 00:43:06,646
BosIey?

394
00:43:07,893 --> 00:43:10,885
Maybe we shouId be doing
our own anaIysis.

395
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:14,393
SureIy Eric wouId be
the best person to--

396
00:43:14,733 --> 00:43:18,567
Our goaI was to Iearn if Red Star
had stoIen your software.

397
00:43:18,837 --> 00:43:22,000
It wouId be unethicaI
to Iet you access their systems.

398
00:43:22,241 --> 00:43:24,232
If we get proof, we'II teII you.

399
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:27,172
That makes sense.
That's cooI. Right?

400
00:43:27,746 --> 00:43:29,077
Right, Viv?

401
00:43:30,883 --> 00:43:33,784
You know, Knox may not be
out of danger yet.

402
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:35,953
SmiIe. Don't panic the cIient.

403
00:43:36,188 --> 00:43:40,352
One of us shouId check
security at his house.

404
00:43:40,626 --> 00:43:42,389
AbsoIuteIy. I agree.

405
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,261
-Everything okay?
-Yeah. Nothing up here.

406
00:43:54,606 --> 00:43:56,938
Wow, that was cooI.

407
00:43:58,744 --> 00:44:00,234
Who's the Green Beret?

408
00:44:01,113 --> 00:44:02,273
My dad.

409
00:44:02,614 --> 00:44:03,945
That's nice.

410
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,780
That's the guy who kiIIed him.

411
00:44:12,624 --> 00:44:16,287
Yeah. They were
in Army InteIIigence together.

412
00:44:16,562 --> 00:44:19,292
This was his best friend
and he turned on him.

413
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:22,456
I'm sorry.

414
00:44:22,801 --> 00:44:23,961
Thanks.

415
00:44:24,803 --> 00:44:26,395
Why do you keep it?

416
00:44:26,638 --> 00:44:31,632
To remind me: Be carefuI who you
trust. Don't take any wooden nickeIs.

417
00:44:32,477 --> 00:44:35,469
What about you?
Did you ever have parents?

418
00:44:35,814 --> 00:44:38,806
I mean-- I know you have parents,
but I mean--

419
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:40,808
Where's your mom?

420
00:44:41,587 --> 00:44:44,750
She died when I was 6,
and I never met my father.

421
00:44:47,326 --> 00:44:49,317
You never met your father?

422
00:44:50,262 --> 00:44:51,752
Now you work for...

423
00:44:53,498 --> 00:44:55,989
...a man you've never seen.

424
00:44:56,501 --> 00:44:58,992
That's an interesting trend.

425
00:45:00,172 --> 00:45:01,503
That was smooth.

426
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,671
Want to pIay ScrabbIe?

427
00:45:04,509 --> 00:45:07,171
Don't worry about it.
I got somebody--

428
00:45:07,512 --> 00:45:09,173
That's okay.

429
00:45:09,514 --> 00:45:11,675
What are they caIIed? You know....

430
00:45:19,691 --> 00:45:21,852
So, okay.

431
00:45:23,528 --> 00:45:25,359
-This is a panic button.
-Okay.

432
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:30,691
If you just press it,
then any one of us...

433
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:34,700
...whoever's cIosest, wiII be here
if there's any probIem.

434
00:45:34,973 --> 00:45:38,306
Like that? Okay.
Right now, that wouId be you.

435
00:45:38,543 --> 00:45:40,534
But you don't have a probIem.

436
00:45:40,879 --> 00:45:42,540
Yeah, I do.

437
00:45:46,218 --> 00:45:47,549
I don't know...

438
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,551
...how to make chicken.

439
00:45:53,558 --> 00:45:54,547
ScrabbIe?

440
00:45:54,993 --> 00:45:56,153
Shake 'N Bake?

441
00:45:56,395 --> 00:45:58,056
I'II shake, you bake?

442
00:46:12,911 --> 00:46:14,572
I want to shake.

443
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:20,244
-Hey, Pete.
-How's it going?

444
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:24,182
-Good. How are you?
-Good. It's good to see you.

445
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:27,080
-You want your ticket?
-AII right!

446
00:46:29,428 --> 00:46:32,420
-Thanks for giving me a chance.
-I wanted to see you.

447
00:46:32,764 --> 00:46:34,095
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

448
00:46:34,433 --> 00:46:36,594
-You Iook great.
-Thank you.

449
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:39,700
I've thought a Iot about us.

450
00:46:39,938 --> 00:46:43,271
No, no, no.
I know you have something to say...

451
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:45,874
...but I have something to say too.

452
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:49,945
I've been thinking a Iot about you
and me and, weII, us.

453
00:46:50,282 --> 00:46:54,776
And I know that we have these crazy
Iives, but I can't heIp it.

454
00:46:55,287 --> 00:46:56,948
I Iove you.

455
00:46:59,124 --> 00:47:03,117
Searching Red Starmainframe
forKnox Technologies software.

456
00:47:03,462 --> 00:47:05,123
Software not detected.

457
00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:08,630
Coming.

458
00:47:12,971 --> 00:47:13,960
HeIIo.

459
00:47:14,172 --> 00:47:16,140
Trick or treat for UNlCEF.

460
00:47:22,981 --> 00:47:25,472
That's a very nice costume,
young Iady.

461
00:47:25,817 --> 00:47:27,808
It gIows in the dark.

462
00:47:29,588 --> 00:47:30,646
I hope you Iike to dance.

463
00:47:30,922 --> 00:47:33,482
Are you kidding? I Iove to dance!

464
00:47:43,168 --> 00:47:45,159
You. You want to dance on-stage?

465
00:47:45,604 --> 00:47:46,593
Us?

466
00:47:46,838 --> 00:47:47,770
Yes!

467
00:47:48,006 --> 00:47:49,997
No, the stage is for the Iadies.

468
00:47:50,342 --> 00:47:53,334
Oh, never mind. I'II just find
a spot on the fIoor.

469
00:47:53,678 --> 00:47:55,009
No, no, wait.

470
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,612
This is Soul Train's highest honor.

471
00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:00,943
I won't Iet you not go up there.
Yeah, she'II go.

472
00:48:01,186 --> 00:48:04,019
ReaIIy? I've aIways wanted
to go up there!

473
00:48:04,356 --> 00:48:05,687
Have a great time.

474
00:48:06,024 --> 00:48:08,015
Okay. I'II be back.

475
00:48:09,694 --> 00:48:13,687
Ms. Wood, there are some Iines
that I never cross.

476
00:48:14,032 --> 00:48:15,795
Lines have never stopped me.

477
00:48:16,368 --> 00:48:18,529
It's ''Miss.'' And it's ''Vivian.''

478
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:20,701
Okay. Miss Vivian.

479
00:48:22,374 --> 00:48:24,865
Okay, Miss Vivian. You're a pro.

480
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:28,873
I mean, you're not a pro,
but you're an executive.

481
00:48:29,548 --> 00:48:32,381
We must keep our reIationship
professionaI.

482
00:48:32,717 --> 00:48:34,207
May I?

483
00:48:36,221 --> 00:48:37,882
I'II get you a gIass.

484
00:49:16,761 --> 00:49:19,093
She's pretty great, isn't she?

485
00:49:29,107 --> 00:49:31,439
I said, she's pretty great, right?

486
00:49:45,624 --> 00:49:47,956
You guys are in reaIIy good shape.

487
00:49:48,293 --> 00:49:50,454
DefiniteIy. DefiniteIy.

488
00:49:55,467 --> 00:49:57,458
AII right. The Robot!

489
00:49:57,802 --> 00:50:01,135
Go, white girI!
Go, white girI!

490
00:50:01,573 --> 00:50:05,065
That's oId schooI, right? DefiniteIy.

491
00:50:06,311 --> 00:50:08,404
I'm Pete. How are you?

492
00:50:13,818 --> 00:50:15,251
The Running Man! Look!

493
00:50:23,995 --> 00:50:26,156
IncredibIe! It was great!

494
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:29,423
I'm having so much fun!
This is so exciting!

495
00:50:29,668 --> 00:50:31,761
You know, I have to go number one.

496
00:50:35,941 --> 00:50:36,999
Look...

497
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:40,501
...what I'm trying to say is...

498
00:50:42,847 --> 00:50:44,508
...wiII you marry me?

499
00:50:47,352 --> 00:50:49,513
Oh, no, baby! Baby?!

500
00:50:50,355 --> 00:50:52,687
Baby?! God, no.

501
00:50:53,525 --> 00:50:55,686
Damn you, SaIazar.

502
00:50:56,027 --> 00:50:58,860
Damn you, SaIazar!

503
00:50:59,531 --> 00:51:00,862
Cut!

504
00:51:01,132 --> 00:51:03,532
Was that over the top?
It feIt over the top.

505
00:51:03,868 --> 00:51:08,134
No. That is the best shot, the best
scene, the best movie on the pIanet!

506
00:51:18,683 --> 00:51:19,843
Hi.

507
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,784
How was your day? Great.

508
00:51:23,521 --> 00:51:28,185
You know how superheroes have these
secret identities, where they--

509
00:51:28,693 --> 00:51:30,456
No. No superheroes.

510
00:51:33,531 --> 00:51:37,194
You're an action star.
I get a Iot of action.

511
00:51:38,536 --> 00:51:40,697
That is so Iame.

512
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,301
Hey, girIs, you having fun?

513
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:45,532
I'm having so much fun
I couId just die.

514
00:51:45,877 --> 00:51:49,005
Jason, I'm one-third of an eIite
crime-fighting team...

515
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,809
...backed by an anonymous miIIionaire.

516
00:51:53,218 --> 00:51:55,209
Yes, that's it.

517
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,231
What are you doing here?

518
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,500
Perfect.

519
00:52:58,883 --> 00:53:00,714
Come on! Go! Hit it!

520
00:53:10,962 --> 00:53:12,793
Murphy O'Meyer...

521
00:53:13,631 --> 00:53:14,962
...that does it.

522
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:16,564
Who sent you?

523
00:53:18,636 --> 00:53:19,796
Who?!

524
00:53:22,807 --> 00:53:24,468
Woo-- Woo--

525
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:26,470
-Who?
-Woo--

526
00:53:29,147 --> 00:53:31,479
-Vivian--
-Spit it out!

527
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,139
Vivian Wood!

528
00:53:36,654 --> 00:53:38,087
You bitch.

529
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:45,990
I Iove a fire.

530
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,286
Hey.

531
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:15,019
Oh, my God! You're hit!

532
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,456
No. I mean, the squibs hurt a bit
when they go off, but I'm fine.

533
00:54:19,697 --> 00:54:21,358
What happened to my traiIer?

534
00:54:22,033 --> 00:54:23,694
I haven't been honest with you.

535
00:54:23,968 --> 00:54:27,131
Were you in there when that happened?
Look at it.

536
00:54:27,372 --> 00:54:28,964
I'm not a bikini waxer.

537
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:36,704
Bummer. I mean, that was
kind of a turn-on.

538
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,150
I have to go.

539
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:49,220
-CharIie?
-Yeah.

540
00:54:50,061 --> 00:54:52,894
I have to go,
but wiII you caII me tomorrow?

541
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,394
-Of course.
-Great. Thanks.

542
00:55:01,372 --> 00:55:02,464
Excuse me.

543
00:55:05,243 --> 00:55:06,904
You're bad.

544
00:55:09,914 --> 00:55:12,906
Guys, finaIIy you warm up a bit.

545
00:55:13,918 --> 00:55:18,252
DyIan? It's Nat. Vivian Wood
is a fake and an aII-around bitch.

546
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:21,923
Her assassin just paid me a visit.
We gotta warn Knox.

547
00:55:22,427 --> 00:55:24,088
I'm at his house now.

548
00:55:24,429 --> 00:55:25,760
You are?

549
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,029
You know what?

550
00:55:28,266 --> 00:55:30,757
Call Alex and meet me at the agency.

551
00:55:33,771 --> 00:55:35,932
DyIan! Shit.

552
00:55:42,614 --> 00:55:45,606
Don't stand next to the window,
it's not safe.

553
00:55:46,284 --> 00:55:47,615
Toga.

554
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:55,122
Listen, I just found out that--
Who's that?

555
00:55:57,128 --> 00:55:58,789
Working undercover?

556
00:55:59,297 --> 00:56:02,130
It's a fuII-service job.

557
00:56:03,468 --> 00:56:04,799
I'II bet.

558
00:56:05,303 --> 00:56:08,636
I can see by your ''gown''
that you're unarmed.

559
00:56:08,973 --> 00:56:12,636
Some maniac couId just stroII in
and bIow you both to bits.

560
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:17,814
Viv, you're obsessed. AII work
and no pIay makes Viv a duII girI.

561
00:56:18,149 --> 00:56:21,641
I have to tie up some Ioose ends here,
so take a seat.

562
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,316
Want some champagne?

563
00:56:31,162 --> 00:56:32,595
''Enemy.''

564
00:56:37,168 --> 00:56:38,499
I know.

565
00:56:48,179 --> 00:56:50,010
Sad news.

566
00:56:50,348 --> 00:56:52,009
Your girIfriends are dead.

567
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:53,681
And Corwin?

568
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:19,474
I don't think it's gonna work out,
you and me.

569
00:57:19,711 --> 00:57:22,874
Which is a reaI bummer,
since you, DyIan...

570
00:57:23,214 --> 00:57:26,047
...are a tomcat in the sack.

571
00:57:28,386 --> 00:57:32,880
Let me get this straight. You're a
woman. Women have naturaI intuition.

572
00:57:33,157 --> 00:57:37,992
And you're a detective. And you had
no idea that this was going to happen?

573
00:57:38,896 --> 00:57:40,887
-I knew.
-She knew.

574
00:57:41,232 --> 00:57:43,063
And I know what'II happen next.

575
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,665
TeII her, baby.

576
00:57:46,904 --> 00:57:50,067
AII the AngeIs are going to heaven.

577
00:57:50,408 --> 00:57:51,568
And BosIey?

578
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,505
We'II keep him. We Iike him.
And his computer.

579
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,177
He's speciaI.

580
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,508
Corwin had nothing to do with this.

581
00:58:01,753 --> 00:58:04,745
No. But I never reaIIy Iiked him.

582
00:58:05,089 --> 00:58:08,024
-And the kidnapping was a setup.
-Afraid so.

583
00:58:08,259 --> 00:58:09,749
And Red Star was a setup.

584
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:13,589
You got it aII figured out.
Any other questions?

585
00:58:13,931 --> 00:58:14,920
Why?

586
00:58:17,268 --> 00:58:18,599
Ask your boss.

587
00:58:19,771 --> 00:58:21,102
CharIie?

588
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,202
You're after CharIie.

589
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,936
CharIie, CharIie, CharIie.

590
00:58:30,448 --> 00:58:32,939
They say that in death...

591
00:58:33,284 --> 00:58:36,117
...aII Iife's questions are answered.

592
00:58:37,288 --> 00:58:38,880
WiII you Iet me know?

593
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,891
Let's go get CharIie.

594
00:58:52,804 --> 00:58:53,964
Come on.

595
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:07,907
Are you aII right?

596
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:09,916
-What's going on?
-Something's going on.

597
00:59:10,121 --> 00:59:11,053
Where's DyIan?

598
00:59:24,168 --> 00:59:29,162
They say in death,
aII Iife's questions are answered.

599
00:59:30,842 --> 00:59:32,332
WiII you Iet me know?

600
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:06,874
What are we doing?
House of Pancakes? SizzIer?

601
01:00:07,211 --> 01:00:09,873
You are the cheapest man
on the pIanet.

602
01:00:23,728 --> 01:00:25,218
What did it Iook Iike?

603
01:00:25,563 --> 01:00:30,227
Oh, I don't know. It was, Iike,
aII cooI and stuff.

604
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,401
You've never seen a booby.

605
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,001
-Have too.
-Have not.

606
01:00:34,238 --> 01:00:36,570
-I've seen Iots of boobies.
-Yeah, right.

607
01:00:40,077 --> 01:00:41,908
A IittIe heIp?

608
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:57,354
Don't ask.

609
01:00:57,595 --> 01:00:59,586
Where's Knox? Is he okay?

610
01:00:59,931 --> 01:01:02,422
Oh, he's great. He's the bad guy.

611
01:01:03,601 --> 01:01:06,593
The kidnapping was a setup.
He's behind it aII.

612
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,532
What? Why?

613
01:01:08,773 --> 01:01:12,766
He wasn't exactIy forthcoming
when he shot me out the window.

614
01:01:24,388 --> 01:01:25,548
BosIey!

615
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:28,623
He's safe! Knox aIready has him.

616
01:01:31,462 --> 01:01:32,793
Wait a minute.

617
01:01:33,631 --> 01:01:35,394
Let me get this straight.

618
01:01:36,634 --> 01:01:37,965
BosIey's with the man...

619
01:01:38,803 --> 01:01:40,896
...who tried to kiII us. That's safe?

620
01:01:41,138 --> 01:01:44,301
He won't kiII BosIey
untiI he kiIIs CharIie.

621
01:01:45,142 --> 01:01:46,632
KiIIs CharIie?

622
01:01:49,146 --> 01:01:50,477
Oh, Jesus.

623
01:01:50,815 --> 01:01:55,479
I don't know what his pIan is,
but I know that we can stop him.

624
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:08,023
If Knox thinks we're dead,
why bIow up the agency?

625
01:02:08,199 --> 01:02:09,757
Why does he want CharIie?

626
01:02:10,001 --> 01:02:12,765
We do know that he wanted us
to break into Red Star.

627
01:02:14,171 --> 01:02:17,504
Imagine how dangerous this wouId be
in the wrong hands.

628
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:21,939
Knox used us to access the mainframe
not to get back his software...

629
01:02:22,179 --> 01:02:24,841
...but for control of theirglobal
positioning satellites.

630
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:28,950
Knox's software can match CharIie's
voice over the phone.

631
01:02:29,186 --> 01:02:31,848
And use Red Star sateIIites
to track him.

632
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:35,615
But why wouId Knox go to so much
troubIe to find CharIie?

633
01:02:36,694 --> 01:02:38,685
That's the guy who kiIIed him.

634
01:02:40,197 --> 01:02:42,688
They were in Army InteIIigence
together.

635
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,798
His best friend turned on him.

636
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,969
Knox thinks CharIie kiIIed his father.

637
01:02:49,874 --> 01:02:52,365
So if he can intercept
CharIie's caII...

638
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:54,200
...he can Iocate him.

639
01:02:54,478 --> 01:02:57,641
But Knox has to get CharIie
on the phone first.

640
01:02:57,882 --> 01:03:02,319
-But the onIy one CharIie caIIs is--
-BosIey.

641
01:03:28,746 --> 01:03:31,738
May I have some ice water, pIease?

642
01:03:54,271 --> 01:03:56,933
FIy to me, AngeIs! PIease come!

643
01:03:57,274 --> 01:03:59,606
PIease fIy to me, AngeIs!

644
01:04:01,112 --> 01:04:04,445
I had a Iong taIk with a squirreI once.

645
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:06,876
Longer than I've taIked to most humans.

646
01:04:30,307 --> 01:04:31,638
HeIIo?

647
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:34,141
HeIIo?

648
01:04:35,312 --> 01:04:37,644
HeIIo. HeIIo out there.

649
01:04:37,982 --> 01:04:39,574
Any sign of BosIey's Iaptop?

650
01:04:39,817 --> 01:04:41,250
They must have taken it.

651
01:04:41,485 --> 01:04:43,976
-We shouId check Knox's pIace.
-Let's go.

652
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:45,244
I'II drive.

653
01:04:45,489 --> 01:04:47,650
Angels?! Angels, help me!

654
01:04:47,992 --> 01:04:48,981
BosIey?

655
01:04:49,326 --> 01:04:50,657
Angels!

656
01:04:50,995 --> 01:04:55,159
We begin our broadcast day!
Come and get me, girIs!

657
01:04:55,666 --> 01:05:00,000
lfyou can follow the sound
ofmy voice, then draw some...

658
01:05:00,337 --> 01:05:01,770
...triangles orsomething...

659
01:05:02,173 --> 01:05:05,006
...to get to this
location and save me!

660
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,176
Is there a way to trace him?

661
01:05:07,678 --> 01:05:10,772
Even with our equipment,
he'd have to be within 20 miIes.

662
01:05:11,015 --> 01:05:14,007
The pIace I'm in Iooks
Iike Cher's bedroom.

663
01:05:14,351 --> 01:05:16,342
And it stinks.

664
01:05:18,189 --> 01:05:19,850
TeII us where you are.

665
01:05:20,191 --> 01:05:21,954
lt smells like the ocean.

666
01:05:22,193 --> 01:05:25,526
And if I Iook out the window,
I see the ocean.

667
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:28,287
He couId be anywhere
this haIf of North America.

668
01:05:28,532 --> 01:05:29,521
Jack...

669
01:05:30,201 --> 01:05:31,691
...teII them where I am.

670
01:05:34,705 --> 01:05:35,694
What?

671
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,969
It's a Sitta pygmaea!

672
01:05:40,878 --> 01:05:42,209
A pygmy nuthatch!

673
01:05:42,546 --> 01:05:44,878
They onIy Iive in one pIace!

674
01:05:45,549 --> 01:05:46,538
CarmeI!

675
01:05:46,884 --> 01:05:49,375
I can't teII you anything eIse,
except...

676
01:05:50,221 --> 01:05:53,884
...this feeIs Iike the first day
of the Iast of my Iife.

677
01:05:54,225 --> 01:05:58,161
Or the Iast day of the first
of my Iife, or something.

678
01:06:00,231 --> 01:06:03,325
I have a Iighthouse, two hoteIs,
seven manor houses...

679
01:06:03,567 --> 01:06:08,561
...one owned by the NationaI Parks,
one by Nick Xero Corporation--

680
01:06:08,906 --> 01:06:12,069
-Is that speIIed with an ''X'' or a ''Z''?
-''X.''

681
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:13,398
It's an anagram.

682
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,336
Rearranged, it's ''Eric Knox.''

683
01:06:17,581 --> 01:06:19,071
ScrabbIe freak.

684
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,580
An oId tunneI Ieads down to the shore.

685
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:26,255
A sea approach is the best way to get
in undetected. We'II need a boat.

686
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,924
And a cover.
We can't use the speedboat.

687
01:06:33,097 --> 01:06:34,928
Head to the marina.

688
01:07:29,486 --> 01:07:32,421
Chad, does this thing go any faster?

689
01:07:32,656 --> 01:07:36,319
We're in a hurry, and I couId
open it up if you Iet me drive.

690
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:41,654
I'm sorry, friend of Starfish. There's
onIy one captain of this Iove boat.

691
01:07:42,499 --> 01:07:44,330
That captain is me...

692
01:07:44,835 --> 01:07:46,427
...the Chad.

693
01:07:46,837 --> 01:07:48,168
The Chad.

694
01:07:48,505 --> 01:07:50,996
Chad, captain of the Iove boat.

695
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:52,598
The Chad.

696
01:07:52,843 --> 01:07:54,435
We're kind of in a hurry.

697
01:07:56,013 --> 01:07:57,503
I'm the Chad.

698
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:14,693
Knox Technologies voice identification
software download confirmed.

699
01:08:26,543 --> 01:08:30,536
Red Starsatellite network uplink
confirmed.

700
01:08:37,721 --> 01:08:39,382
Revenge is fun.

701
01:08:42,192 --> 01:08:44,558
I have to say, Starfish,
I am honored...

702
01:08:44,895 --> 01:08:49,662
...that you've taken an interest in my
work. And I think you're very pretty.

703
01:08:50,067 --> 01:08:51,398
Starfish?

704
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:53,559
Where are you going?

705
01:08:54,905 --> 01:08:58,238
Starfish, are you going swimming?
Where are you going?

706
01:08:58,509 --> 01:08:59,908
Where are you going again?

707
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:01,508
Starfish?

708
01:09:03,847 --> 01:09:05,178
Was it the Chad?

709
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,912
No! The Chad was great!

710
01:09:17,828 --> 01:09:19,557
The Chad was great.

711
01:09:57,768 --> 01:09:59,861
I'II tap the signaI from the roof.

712
01:10:00,204 --> 01:10:03,571
-I'II deaI with Knox.
-I'II bring our BosIey back.

713
01:10:25,829 --> 01:10:28,161
''I don't know how to make chicken.''

714
01:10:28,398 --> 01:10:29,729
Jerk.

715
01:11:05,235 --> 01:11:06,065
DyIan.

716
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:08,902
Thank God you're aIive.

717
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,501
You know my better haIf.

718
01:11:12,709 --> 01:11:17,510
It figures I'd meet the perfect guy
and he'd aIready have a perfect girI.

719
01:11:46,643 --> 01:11:48,133
HeIIo, bIondie.

720
01:11:48,478 --> 01:11:50,139
Her girIfriend's here.

721
01:11:51,481 --> 01:11:54,644
Jimmy, PauIie, go secure BosIey,
wouId you?

722
01:11:55,319 --> 01:11:57,651
Like now, now, now, now.

723
01:12:02,492 --> 01:12:03,823
Bos?

724
01:12:04,328 --> 01:12:06,489
-BosIey?
-NataIie?

725
01:12:07,164 --> 01:12:08,825
NataIie, is that you?

726
01:12:09,166 --> 01:12:10,997
Behind this door.

727
01:12:12,836 --> 01:12:15,498
BosIey, I'm so happy to see you!

728
01:12:16,673 --> 01:12:18,664
We're aII here. I'II get you out.

729
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:27,681
Red wire.

730
01:12:28,352 --> 01:12:29,683
BIue wire.

731
01:12:32,356 --> 01:12:34,688
GPS phone tap.

732
01:12:37,527 --> 01:12:39,358
Pygmy nuthatch.

733
01:12:41,365 --> 01:12:44,027
-I'm getting tickIed.
-Who's caIIing now?

734
01:12:44,801 --> 01:12:45,699
It's Pete!

735
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:48,201
HeIIo?

736
01:12:48,538 --> 01:12:50,529
Hi, Pete. How are you?

737
01:12:50,807 --> 01:12:53,207
Good. You said you wanted me to caII.

738
01:12:53,477 --> 01:12:56,378
I did want you to caII.
I mean, I do want you to.

739
01:12:56,647 --> 01:12:58,205
Ask if he can caII you back.

740
01:12:58,548 --> 01:13:00,379
I'm so happy to hear from you.

741
01:13:00,651 --> 01:13:03,984
I wanted to taIk.
I Iike spending time with you.

742
01:13:04,221 --> 01:13:07,713
I'd Iike to see more of you,
maybe in a continuous bIock.

743
01:13:07,991 --> 01:13:11,654
I know. It's just been crazy
this week at work.

744
01:13:11,895 --> 01:13:13,226
Watch your back!

745
01:13:17,401 --> 01:13:18,493
Use the sIeeper.

746
01:13:22,572 --> 01:13:25,405
Never send a man to do a woman's job.

747
01:13:28,245 --> 01:13:31,078
-Nice work, NataIie.
-Thanks, BosIey.

748
01:13:32,416 --> 01:13:34,077
Pete? Hi.

749
01:13:35,252 --> 01:13:38,585
You know, under different
circumstances...

750
01:13:38,855 --> 01:13:41,016
...we'd have made a great coupIe.

751
01:13:41,258 --> 01:13:45,695
If you hadn't shot me out a window
and tried to kiII everyone I Iove...

752
01:13:45,929 --> 01:13:47,590
...we couId have had a chance.

753
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:50,232
Can you keep a secret?

754
01:13:51,768 --> 01:13:53,759
I mean, you can't teII anyone.

755
01:13:54,037 --> 01:13:55,698
That you're disgusting?

756
01:13:58,608 --> 01:14:01,441
You have the fuIIest, sweetest...

757
01:14:03,113 --> 01:14:04,774
...most Iuscious...

758
01:14:05,949 --> 01:14:07,940
...Iips I have ever...

759
01:14:08,785 --> 01:14:10,116
...kissed.

760
01:14:13,123 --> 01:14:15,614
I just gotta take this caII.

761
01:14:20,297 --> 01:14:23,130
Nine o'cIock, CharIie. Right on time.

762
01:14:26,403 --> 01:14:28,633
Enter. Come on.

763
01:14:37,247 --> 01:14:39,579
Mr. BosIey's phone,
Eric Knox speaking.

764
01:14:39,816 --> 01:14:42,250
Mr. Knox? This is Charles Townsend.

765
01:14:48,091 --> 01:14:51,754
l앐 delighted the Angels helped you.
Are you in the office?

766
01:14:55,265 --> 01:14:57,597
Hang up, CharIie.
He's aImost got you.

767
01:14:57,801 --> 01:15:01,259
We're aII at the beach,
having mimosas. Can you join us?

768
01:15:01,505 --> 01:15:05,339
I'II take a rain check, Eric.
Is BosIey there?

769
01:15:05,675 --> 01:15:08,439
He went to the men's room.
He'II be right back.

770
01:15:10,013 --> 01:15:11,844
No, wait. He's coming.

771
01:15:12,182 --> 01:15:13,513
BosIey?

772
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:21,020
Okay, here we go.

773
01:15:32,202 --> 01:15:35,194
That's not him. Sorry.

774
01:15:35,472 --> 01:15:37,531
Can you hoId on one second Ionger?

775
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:39,303
Not a problem.

776
01:15:42,145 --> 01:15:44,136
Pete? Can you hoId on a second?

777
01:15:44,448 --> 01:15:45,437
Sure.

778
01:15:45,882 --> 01:15:48,043
I Iike him so much.

779
01:15:58,395 --> 01:15:59,225
Hey, Bos.

780
01:16:01,465 --> 01:16:02,625
BosIey?

781
01:16:04,134 --> 01:16:05,465
He's coming, sir.

782
01:16:31,995 --> 01:16:33,656
Sorry, not him.

783
01:16:34,664 --> 01:16:36,427
Can I take a message?

784
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,091
Just tell him l called, as planned.

785
01:16:46,176 --> 01:16:47,507
Gotcha.

786
01:17:13,036 --> 01:17:14,367
Just one more sec.

787
01:17:14,638 --> 01:17:16,629
Is this a bad time?

788
01:17:17,707 --> 01:17:19,868
You seem a IittIe distracted.

789
01:17:25,549 --> 01:17:27,210
Is this the famous CharIie?

790
01:17:27,551 --> 01:17:29,212
No, this is Pete.

791
01:17:31,788 --> 01:17:34,018
Hey! I Iike that guy!

792
01:17:44,367 --> 01:17:46,801
That man's got a beautifuI
teIephone voice.

793
01:17:49,372 --> 01:17:51,863
That's one more daddy
you'II never know.

794
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:56,872
Bad news.

795
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:59,211
I have to Ieave.

796
01:17:59,983 --> 01:18:02,975
I gotta go torture and kiII your boss.

797
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:06,215
Mikey, Jerry...

798
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:08,714
...you guys Iike angeI cake?

799
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:23,662
Do you know how hard it is to find
a quaIity man in Los AngeIes?

800
01:18:49,499 --> 01:18:51,831
Don't take my Iighter.

801
01:19:08,018 --> 01:19:10,851
Wait, wait, wait!
I have something to teII you.

802
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:13,112
By the time this is over...

803
01:19:13,456 --> 01:19:16,619
...aII of you wiII be facedown
on the fIoor...

804
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:18,521
...and I'II moon-waIk out of here.

805
01:19:20,530 --> 01:19:22,191
You're not Iistening to me.

806
01:19:22,532 --> 01:19:26,024
First, you're going to heIp me
out of my chair.

807
01:19:26,369 --> 01:19:29,031
Then I'II Ieapfrog over you...

808
01:19:30,373 --> 01:19:32,534
...before I break his nose.

809
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:35,475
Since my trusty Iighter...

810
01:19:35,712 --> 01:19:39,876
...isn't working, I'II do aII this
with my hands tied behind my back.

811
01:19:41,551 --> 01:19:42,711
Get her!

812
01:19:55,398 --> 01:19:57,059
King Kong paIm.

813
01:20:09,079 --> 01:20:10,740
Buddha on Iotus.

814
01:20:31,935 --> 01:20:34,927
And that's kicking your ass.

815
01:20:57,927 --> 01:20:58,757
AIex!

816
01:21:28,792 --> 01:21:30,282
Thanks, Bos!

817
01:22:37,193 --> 01:22:39,184
Come on, we'II miss happy hour.

818
01:22:39,529 --> 01:22:42,123
He's heading north,
just past Paradise Cove!

819
01:22:42,532 --> 01:22:45,865
Oh, boy, they found him.
That's CharIie's cabin.

820
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:51,633
-You've seen it?
-You've seen CharIie?

821
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:53,638
I am his trusted friend and empIoyee.

822
01:22:53,877 --> 01:22:55,310
You've met CharIie?

823
01:22:55,545 --> 01:22:57,035
What do you mean, ''met''?

824
01:22:57,313 --> 01:22:59,975
You've seen him with your own eyes.

825
01:23:01,217 --> 01:23:02,980
I saw his hand.

826
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:05,720
It couId have been anyone's hand.

827
01:23:20,236 --> 01:23:20,270
Let's see if I can win the teddy bear!

828
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:24,001
Let's see if I can win the teddy bear!

829
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:35,041
Sorry, CharIie.

830
01:25:20,523 --> 01:25:23,788
Get DyIan!
The missiIe's making a round trip!

831
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,130
DyIan!

832
01:25:51,354 --> 01:25:52,514
Let's go!

833
01:26:48,277 --> 01:26:49,437
CharIie.

834
01:27:02,892 --> 01:27:04,223
You guys...

835
01:27:05,228 --> 01:27:07,219
...we're finaIIy meeting CharIie.

836
01:27:09,065 --> 01:27:10,896
Do I Iook okay?

837
01:27:14,237 --> 01:27:15,727
ShouId we knock?

838
01:27:31,087 --> 01:27:32,418
CharIie?

839
01:27:45,268 --> 01:27:47,600
Good morning, Angels.

840
01:27:55,278 --> 01:27:57,769
Sorry l couldn앖 stick around.

841
01:27:59,115 --> 01:28:01,948
We're so happy you're okay, CharIie.

842
01:28:02,285 --> 01:28:06,949
l앐 just fine, Angels.
Mission accomplished?

843
01:28:09,292 --> 01:28:11,954
I think the cIient was bIown away.

844
01:28:15,965 --> 01:28:18,798
Eric Knox was born John McCadden.

845
01:28:19,135 --> 01:28:21,968
lt seems his life압 mission
was to bring me down.

846
01:28:22,205 --> 01:28:27,142
His dad was in myArmy lntelligence
unit, working as a double agent.

847
01:28:27,376 --> 01:28:30,539
When he was discovered,
the otherside killed him.

848
01:28:30,813 --> 01:28:33,976
I guess that's not
the story Knox heard.

849
01:28:35,818 --> 01:28:39,811
CharIie, I've reaIIy enjoyed
working on this assignment...

850
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:44,153
...and I eagerIy anticipate
returning to work.

851
01:28:45,561 --> 01:28:47,188
BosIey's had one too many Buddhas.

852
01:28:47,396 --> 01:28:49,387
He's definiteIy had a few.

853
01:28:49,665 --> 01:28:52,065
l have a team rebuilding the office.

854
01:28:52,335 --> 01:28:54,997
lt앏l be better than new
when you get back.

855
01:28:55,338 --> 01:28:57,329
Thank you, CharIie.

856
01:28:58,007 --> 01:29:01,340
Is there any chance
you'II be joining us, CharIie?

857
01:29:03,179 --> 01:29:05,340
I'd Iove to, AngeIs.

858
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:11,178
But I have some precious treasures
to watch over.

859
01:29:12,021 --> 01:29:14,012
Come on, CharIie, it'II be fun.

860
01:29:14,257 --> 01:29:16,919
We're drinking from coconuts
and Buddhas.

861
01:29:19,195 --> 01:29:22,028
How wiII we ever know
you truIy exist...

862
01:29:22,265 --> 01:29:24,859
...unIess you come
have a coconut with us?

863
01:29:26,535 --> 01:29:30,198
Faith, Angels. lt압 called faith.

864
01:29:36,812 --> 01:29:37,779
To CharIie.

865
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:38,776
To CharIie.

866
01:29:38,981 --> 01:29:39,811
To CharIie.

867
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:41,639
To CharIie.

868
01:29:45,321 --> 01:29:48,313
Let me toast you Iadies,
with some ice cubes!

869
01:31:05,234 --> 01:31:06,724
Safe!

870
01:31:07,436 --> 01:31:09,836
I have to go. I'm so sorry.

871
01:31:14,777 --> 01:31:17,268
I shouId go. I reaIIy shouId.

872
01:31:24,053 --> 01:31:27,386
Let's see if I can win the teddy bear!

873
01:31:58,154 --> 01:31:59,917
The Chad is great.

874
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:03,481
He's great. He's great.

875
01:32:03,826 --> 01:32:07,660
The Chad is great. He's great.

876
01:32:10,433 --> 01:32:12,424
The Chad is great.

877
01:32:14,003 --> 01:32:16,494
The Chad is stuck.

878
01:32:27,183 --> 01:32:29,515
I'm having heImet probIems.

879
01:32:31,854 --> 01:32:34,516
I'm having serious heImet probIems.

880
01:32:43,532 --> 01:32:44,897
Nice!
