1
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,960
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

2
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,120
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,360
on earth as it is in heaven.

4
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,120
Give us this day
our daily bread,

5
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,320
and forgive us our trespasses,

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,320
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,400
And lead us not into temptation,

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,280
but deliver us from evil.

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,640
For Thine is the kingdom,
the power...

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,840
and the glory now and forever.

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,760
- Amen.
- Amen.

12
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,280
Thank you, Father Macklepenny,

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,720
for coming all the way
across town to be our guest speaker.

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,760
When Iraisemy flashing sword...

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,120
and my hand
takes hold on judgment,

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,800
I will take vengeance
up on mine enemies.

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,600
And I will repay those
who haze me.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,880
O Lord, raise me
to Thy right hand...

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,200
and count me among Thy saints.

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,240
And I am reminded
on this holy day...

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,400
of the sad story
of Kitty Genovese.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,800
As you all may remember,

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,800
a long time ago,
almost 30 years ago,

24
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,840
this poor soul
cried out for help...

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,360
time and time again,

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,200
but no person answer her calls.

27
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,040
Though many saw,

28
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,920
no one so much
as called the police.

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,640
They all just watched as Kitty
was being stabbed to death...

30
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,120
in broad daylight.

31
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,640
They watched as
her assailant walked away.

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,080
Now, we must all fear evil men.

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,040
But there is
another kind of evil...

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,680
which we must fear most,

35
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,320
and that is the indifference...

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,560
of good men!

37
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,480
I do believe the monsignor's
finally got the point.

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,400
Aye.

39
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,360
Hey, Connor!

40
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,160
What?

41
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,920
Yeah! Who's the master?

42
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,360
You're gonna be
training her today.

43
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,880
Aye.

44
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,920
- Basically, the rule of thumb here is...
- Wait. Rule of thumb?

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,720
In the early 1900s, it was legal
for men to beat their wives...

46
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,920
as long as they used a stick
no wider than their thumb.

47
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,120
Can't do much damage
with that then, can we?

48
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,040
Perhaps it should've been
the "rule of wrist".

49
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,120
I knew you two pricks
would give me problems.

50
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,720
Come on. It's St. Patty's Day.
It's all in good fun.

51
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,680
Ah, fuck you!
And fuck you too!

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,640
We're sorry, all right?
Just relax.

53
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,760
Oh, shit.

54
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,040
Hey, fuck-ass, give me a beer.

55
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,080
Listen, boys, I've got
some very bad news.

56
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,040
I'm gonna have to
close down the bar.

57
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,880
The Russians are buying up buildings
all over the town, includin' this one.

58
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,120
Fuck! Ass!

59
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,680
And they're not lettin' me
renew my lease.

60
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,480
- Let me talk to my boss.

61
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,200
- Maybe he can do something.
- What the fuck's your boss gonna do?

62
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,000
Listen, fellas,
I don't want anyone to know.

63
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,040
So you keep your traps shut!

64
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,880
You know what they say:
People in glass houses sink ships.

65
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,440
Hey, Doc, I gotta buy you,
like, a proverb book or somethin'.

66
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,960
This mix-and-match shit
has gotta go.

67
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,360
What?

68
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,640
A penny saved is worth
two in the bush, isn't it?

69
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,920
And don't cross the road
if you can't get out of the kitchen.

70
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,400
What's this, then?

71
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,320
I am Ivan Checkov,
and you will be closing now.

72
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,000
Checkov.

73
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,240
Well, this here's McCoy. We find
a Spock, we've got us an away team.

74
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,640
Me in no mood for discussion.
You, you stay.

75
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,360
The rest of you, go now.

76
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,240
Why don't you make like a tree
and get the fuck out ofhere!

77
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,320
You know he's got
till the week's end, right?

78
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,680
You don't have to be
hard-asses, do ya?

79
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,280
It's St. Patty's Day.
Everyone's Irish tonight.

80
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,520
Why don't you just pull up a stool
and have a drink with us?

81
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,040
This is no game! If you won't go,

82
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,600
we will make you go.

83
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,560
So these two guys are kickin'
the shit out of each other, right?

84
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,400
This guy picks up
an old kitchen sink or something...

85
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,680
and fuckin' crushes
this guy with it.

86
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,760
It makes a big bang.

87
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,400
Look at him. His spine's all crushed.
Had to be one big motherfucker.

88
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,360
Huge. Three, four hundred pounds.
Fuckin' huge.

89
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,720
- That's pretty thin.
- Very thin.

90
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,160
Okay.
All right, all right.

91
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,680
Say these two guys right here,
they don't even know the fuckin' huge guy.

92
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,720
They're just staggering home from a bar
still all fucked up from St. Patty's last night.

93
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,360
They decide to take a shortcut
down through the alley.

94
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,560
Wrong fuckin' alley, huh?

95
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,840
'Cause this big motherfucker,
he's just waitin' for 'em, right?

96
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,480
And what could be more perfect for a
strong-arm robbery? Two drunk guys all bandaged up.

97
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,960
They're already injured,
for Christ's sakes. Lookat 'em.

98
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,280
These guys are stumblin'
through the alley.

99
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,640
This guy takes a blunt object,
fuckin'...

100
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,840
Hits the guy with the bandages around
his head, right? Why? 'Cause he's smart.

101
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,000
He knows the guy with the band age
around his ass, he ain't goin' nowhere.

102
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,600
He's goin' fuckin' nowhere!

103
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,480
Where are you goin'?
Nowhere! That's right.

104
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,360
He ain't done yet. He comes over
and jumps on this guy's back...

105
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,280
and crushes him to death.

106
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,960
I feel something big here.

107
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,120
I wouldn't be surprised to see
a lot of these turnin' up.

108
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,040
Brilliant!

109
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,120
So now we got
a huge guy theory...

110
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,560
and a serial crusher theory.

111
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,640
Top notch.

112
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,880
- What's your name?
- Detective Greenly.

113
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,960
- Who the fuck are you?
- That's who the fuck I am.

114
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,320
Listen, I gotta do this
by the numbers.

115
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,040
I.D. just came back
on these guys.

116
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,200
They got connections
with the Russian mob.

117
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,960
That makes it
a federal matter.

118
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,320
And Agent Smecker here is heading up
the investigation with our full cooperation.

119
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,480
- Why don't you get me a cup of coffee?
- Who the hell is this?

120
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,560
- A cafe latte, twist of lemon,
- What the fuck...

121
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,800
- Chief, what the fuck is this?
- Sweet 'N Low.

122
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,520
- Mitchell, Langley!

123
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,480
- Yes, sir.
- Find the manager of this building.

124
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,360
See if he's had any complaints
of water coming down...

125
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,520
in any of the apartments
startingjust this morning.

126
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,160
Langley, you take that building.
Same thing.

127
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,680
Chaffey! Newman!

128
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,800
- Yes, sir.
- Look in the trash around their hands.

129
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,720
See if you can fnd me
two bullet casings,

130
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,640
fifty-caliber
if my eyes serve me right.

131
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,400
Newman,
rip through this shit.

132
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,760
If this was a sink,

133
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,680
find me some metal parts.

134
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,120
Give me a drain cover,
faucet or something.

135
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,120
Got it right here.
It's a 50-cal.

136
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,080
Chief, can you get
ballistics down here...

137
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,720
and tell 'em they have to dig
a 50-caliber slug...

138
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,600
out ofa brickwall and locate another
that's been fired through a Dumpster?

139
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,520
We have the best
ballistics guy in the world.

140
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,160
- I can have him here in ten minutes.
- How did you know that?

141
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,160
Liquid paraffn.

142
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,440
Came up positive.

143
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,760
And bullet holes
are usually a big clue.

144
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,000
Nobody reported any gunshots.

145
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,360
This is an Irish neighborhood.
I'm surprised you even got a phone call.

146
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,080
You know, I can't find
these condone, sir.

147
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,040
Look under the body.

148
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,400
Oh, yeah, there it is.

149
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,560
You guys ready for this?

150
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,760
This was no
gangland assassination.

151
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,360
Though creative,
it was way too sloppy.

152
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,600
Something went wrong here.
This has "personal" written all over it.

153
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,880
Agent Smecker.
Yeah, this is all illegal loft housing.

154
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,640
There's no manager on the premises,
but they found a lady on the fourth floor...

155
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,800
who said she had water dripping
down on her whole place.

156
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,960
- It started just this morning.
- Fourth floor?

157
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,960
Then we're headin'
to the fifth.

158
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,960
Come on. Let's get out of here.
You're reachin, man.

159
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,400
- It's a theory.
- I don't know. No way.

160
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,280
You know how big a guy's
gotta be to do that? Fuckin' huge.

161
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,400
Oh, really? I might just be
wantin' a bagel with my coffee.

162
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,760
I ain't gettin' him
no fuckin' bagel.

163
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,600
We'll start the ass kissing
with you.

164
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,200
Agent Smecker. Agent...

165
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,040
Listen, I know this
neighborhood pretty good.

166
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,960
There's a bar down the block
named McGinty's.

167
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,560
- It stands a good chance they were there last night.
- Good work, Mitchell.

168
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,120
I'll check it out myself.

169
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,840
Lookat the ceiling.
Sensey our touch alone.

170
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Wait until you feel me move.

171
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,480
So quick you couldn't
even feel it go, could you?

172
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,480
Let's try it again.
Try it again. Look at the ceiling.

173
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,400
It's Doc.

174
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,160
- Thanks for comin', Doc.
- Jesus Christ!

175
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,440
What the fuck happened?
Are you boys all right?

176
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,800
- We're alive.
- An F.B.I. agent came by the bar...

177
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,720
and he left me his ca...

178
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,080
He left me his c...
Oh, he fuckin' gave me this. Fuck!

179
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,400
Ass! What are you gonna do?

180
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,840
We oughta turn ourselves in,
tell him it was self-defense.

181
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's what he said.

182
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,960
- How the fuck's he know that? We haven't
spoken to anyone. - Don't know.

183
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,560
He didn't say.

184
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,080
All right. Listen, Doc,
we need you to do us a favor.

185
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,680
- Anything.
- Just hold on to this for us.

186
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,760
- We're gonna come back for it when we get out.
- Right.

187
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,640
Fuck! Ass!

188
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,320
None of that cursing was directed at you.
He's... He's a bit...

189
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,040
First of all,

190
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,080
I'd like to thank
which ever one of you...

191
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,160
doughnut-munching,
barrel-assed,

192
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,800
pud-pulling sissies
leaked this to the press.

193
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,880
That's just
what we need now...

194
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,920
some sensational story
in the papers...

195
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,720
making these boys out to be
superheroes triumphing over evil.

196
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,560
Let me squash
the rumors now.

197
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,160
These two are not heroes.

198
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,040
They're just
two ordinary men...

199
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,680
who were put in
an extraordinary situation,

200
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,040
and they just happened
to come out on top.

201
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,920
Yes, nothing from our
far-reaching computer system...

202
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,840
has turned up diddly
on these two.

203
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,200
All we know is what
we found out from the neighbors.

204
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,120
And the general consensus is,

205
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,600
they're angels.

206
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,920
But angels don't kill.

207
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,520
And we got
two bodies in the morgue...

208
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,880
that look like they've been
serial-crushed...

209
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,520
by some huge, friggin' guy.

210
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,440
Are we considering these guys
armed and dangerous?

211
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,400
Well, not armed.

212
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,880
If they had guns, they would've used them.
But dangerous? Very.

213
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,800
Now, what makes you think
they're dangerous?

214
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,240
Maybe they're just
protectin' each other.

215
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,080
Hey, look, I-I-I'm not sayin'
one way or the other.

216
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,080
Just be careful and go
by the protocol on this.

217
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,400
It's grunt police work
that's gonna bring this one in.

218
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,120
These guys are
miles away by now.

219
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,320
But if you wanna beat your head against the wall,
then here's what you're lookin'for.

220
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,560
They're scared, like
two little bunny rabbits.

221
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,440
Anything in a uniform or flashing
blue lights is gonna spook 'em.

222
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,320
Okay? So the only thing we can do
is put a potato on a string...

223
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,240
and drag it through
South Boston.

224
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,760
Thanks for comin' out.

225
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,440
You'd probably have
better luckwith a beer.

226
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,480
You would.

227
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,280
- Oh, fuck.
- Hey, Greenly.

228
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,280
Onion bagel, cream cheese.

229
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,960
This conversation
is going to be recorded.

230
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,200
Just answer to
the best of your knowledge.

231
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,640
Excuse me, sir.
Please.

232
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,200
Okay, we're ready.

233
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,320
You boys are not under oath here.
Just answer the questions.

234
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,560
I'm assuming...

235
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,520
you knew these guys
from before?

236
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,920
We met them last night.

237
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,720
They had some
pretty interesting bandages.

238
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,640
Know anything about that?

239
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,480
Listen, if you want to fight,
you can see you're out numbered here.

240
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,400
We're trying to be civil,
so I suggest you take our offer.

241
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,640
I make the offers.

242
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,680
Hey, Boris.

243
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,920
What would you do...

244
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,040
if I told you...

245
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,960
your pinko Commie mother
sucks so much dick,

246
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,480
her face looks like an egg?

247
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,640
- Fuck you!
- What are you doin'?

248
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,600
Stay away!
He can take care of himself!

249
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,880
Freeze, you fuckin' Irish faggots!

250
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,760
Get the fuck up!

251
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,000
- Come on!
- Get your fuckin' hands off of me!

252
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,400
Cuff yourself around the back!
Cuff yourself!

253
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,880
Cuff it!

254
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,600
You know why
I fucking come here?

255
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,880
I come here to kill you.

256
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,920
But now, I no think
I fucking kill you.

257
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,880
I kill your brother.

258
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,880
Shoothim in thehead.

259
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,320
- Fuck you!
- Gotta go.

260
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,640
Connor!

261
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,360
It was just a fuckin' bar fight!
You guys are fuckin' pussies!

262
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,240
I hope your conscience
is clear, Irishman.

263
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,080
So, how is it...

264
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,760
- that you guys are fluent in Russian?
- We paid attention in school.

265
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,000
Do you speak
any other languages?

266
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,320
- Aye. Our mother insisted on it.
- French?

267
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,000
Oh, that's beautiful.

268
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,880
- What's that?
- It's Italian.

269
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,840
- Jawohl.

270
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,880
What are you guys doin' workin'
at a friggin' meat packing plant?

271
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,840
- Agent Smecker? Thepress is everywhere.
- Yeah.

272
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,800
They're just goin' nuts for these guys.
I don't know what you wanna do.

273
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,440
You're not being charged.
It's up to you. You wanna talk to 'em?

274
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,840
- Absolutely not.
- No pictures either.

275
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,160
Is there anyway
that we could stay here?

276
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,040
Yeah. You know, we have an
extra holding cell you guys can...

277
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,480
- Can they stay?
- Well, we'll have to check with your mom.

278
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,000
But it's okay with me
if your friends sleep over.

279
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,880
Time to feed the dogs.

280
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,720
Okay, people. Okay.

281
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,680
This is our offcial statement.

282
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,360
The MacManus brothers
are not being charged with a crime.

283
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,920
This isa clear-cutcase
of self-defense.

284
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,280
They are being released
at an undisclosed time and location...

285
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,200
in accordance with
their wishes.

286
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,960
- Do the MacManus brothers have any priors?
- Can we speak to the brothers?

287
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,640
- Hey, Rocco, how you doin'?
- Hey!

288
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,160
Yeah!

289
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,520
What have you got there?

290
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,200
Very nice.

291
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,480
This poor soul...

292
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,400
cried out for help.

293
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,640
They watched as
he simply walked away.

294
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,320
Indifference of good men!

295
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,240
Nobody wanted to get involved.

296
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,800
Nobody.

297
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,000
Who so ever shed my blood,

298
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,720
by man shall his blood be shed.

299
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,080
For in the image of God
may deem aman.

300
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,040
Destroy all that which is evil.

301
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,480
So that which is good
may flourish.

302
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,840
What the fuck is that?

303
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,320
It's that fuckin' Russian's pager.

304
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,440
Let's go.

305
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,360
How are ya?

306
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,720
- Keep the faith, man.
- Fuckin' blow me.

307
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,120
- What was that? Have you got a pen?
- Yeah. Here you go.

308
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,320
- Thanks. Be right back.
- Good morning, son. How are ya?

309
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,160
- Good morning.
- We'd be honored if you would join us.

310
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,440
- See this?
- What's this?

311
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,360
Saints?

312
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,800
Body of Christ.
Body of Christ.

313
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,840
Amen.

314
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,440
That's not funny, man.
Give it here, package boy.

315
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,480
Joey Beevo said it was important.
Said to give it to him myself.

316
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,280
Give me the fuckin' thing.

317
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,240
Sit the fuck down.

318
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,280
So, I'm Rocco.
I'm the funny man.

319
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,080
I'm so fuckin' funny.

320
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,840
Fuck you, Vincenzo.

321
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,200
How did you get
that shiner on your eye?

322
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,160
What's the matter, someone
didn't think you were very funny?

323
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,440
I caught your show at the
Velvet Room at the Holiday Inn.

324
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,240
Loved it when you busted into
"Viva Las Vegas."

325
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,840
Hey, hey, hey.

326
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,720
You insignifcant little fuck!

327
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,720
I always get my money,
you cock sucking bastardo!

328
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,960
The '90s are killing me.

329
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,880
I shouldn't have done that.

330
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,360
You're not supposed to tell a guy
you're gonna kill him no more.

331
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,640
I gotta tip to through the tulips
with these assholes.

332
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,920
Taking all the fun
out of the job.

333
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,520
Pappa Joe,
you want me to go now?

334
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,120
All the boys tell me how you
make them laugh when you come around.

335
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,920
What a crack up you are.
What do they call you?

336
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,040
The...

337
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,520
The funny man.

338
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,440
The funny man.

339
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,800
I'm having a shitty day.
I'm depressed.

340
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,560
Tell me a funny joke.

341
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,080
Now?

342
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,040
A joke?

343
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,440
A joke. Yeah, all right.

344
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,920
There's these, three guys...

345
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,120
a spic,

346
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,040
a white guy and a black guy.

347
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,560
- Nigger!
- Yeah.

348
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,880
N... Yeah. And they're walkin'
along the beach.

349
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,680
They see this pot.
They rub it, a genie comes out.

350
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,520
Genie says you can wish for anything you want.
He asks the Mexican whathe wants.

351
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,480
And he goes,

352
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,280
"I want all my people in America
to be happy and free in Mexico."

353
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,600
So the genie... Poof!
And all the spics are in Mexico.

354
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,000
- And then he asks the black guy...
- Nigger.

355
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,360
Yeah, that's what I said.

356
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,040
He goes to the nigger,
says, "What do you want?"

357
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,960
And he goes,

358
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,760
"I want all my African...

359
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,560
"my nigger brothers
in America...

360
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,480
to be back in Africa
and happy and everything."

361
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,560
So the genie goes poof!

362
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,120
And, um, all the niggers
in America...

363
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,680
are in Africa.

364
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,960
And this is goin'...
I'm not funny today.

365
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,840
I know. I'm havin' a hard day.
I... This joke sucks.

366
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,240
It's just a stupid joke.

367
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,120
Continue the joke.

368
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,400
So the genie
says to the white guy,

369
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,520
"What's your one wish?"

370
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,560
And the white guy goes,
"You mean to tell me...

371
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,760
all the niggers and spics
are out of America?"

372
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,800
The genie goes, "Yeah."
He says,

373
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,760
"Well, I'll have a Coke then."

374
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,520
"I'll have a Coke..."

375
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,760
Yeah. Everybody's out,

376
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,520
so he just wants a Coke,
'cause that's all he needs.

377
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,760
- Tell me one more.
- What?

378
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,280
Knock your selves out.

379
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,240
Fuckin' hell.

380
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,960
- Do you know what we need, man? Some rope.
- Absolutely.

381
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,880
- What are ya, insane?
- No, it ain't.

382
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,080
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.

383
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,640
- What?
- Yeah.

384
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,360
He's got a lot of rope strapped around him
in the movies, and they always end up using it.

385
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,120
- You've lost it, haven't it?
- No, I'mserious.

386
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,960
That's stupid. Name one thing
you'd need a rope for.

387
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,640
You don't fuckin' know what you're
gonna need it for. They just always need it.

388
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,160
What's this "they" shit ?
This isn't a movie.

389
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,560
Oh. Right.

390
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,280
Is that right, Rambo?

391
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,400
All right.
Get your stupid fuckin' rope.

392
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,840
I'll get my stupid rope.

393
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,800
I'll get it.

394
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,000
There's rope right there.

395
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,720
You nervous?

396
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,120
- A bit.
- Myself as well.

397
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,920
Hello?

398
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,560
Room number?

399
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,800
Have we got a time ofdeath?

400
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,400
We got a body count?

401
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,840
I'll be down there in a bit.

402
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,960
Keep the press out.

403
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,760
- What are you doin'?
- I just wanted to cuddle.

404
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,320
Cuddle? What a fag.

405
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,240
This is a fucking
slaughter house.

406
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,720
- How many bodies, Greenly?
- Eight.

407
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,040
Aw, shit. I forgot about that one.
Nine. Nine?

408
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,960
While Greenly's out gettin' coffee,
any body else want anything?

409
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,520
Shit!

410
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,720
So, Duffy,

411
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,520
you got any theories
to go with that tie?

412
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,640
Look, fuck all
these other guys.

413
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,960
This was their target...
the fag man.

414
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,360
The what man?

415
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,480
The fat man.

416
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,640
Well, Freud was right.

417
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,480
So you think they came
for the fag man, huh?

418
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,960
What do you base this about

419
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,600
He was the only one done right.
Double tap back of the head.

420
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,120
- And the pennies?
- New hit man wants to leave his mark.

421
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,080
That's a possibility.

422
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,000
Now you Irish cops
are perkin'up.

423
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,920
That's two sound theories
in one day,

424
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,840
neither of which deal
with abnormally-sized men.

425
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,080
Kind of makes me feel
like River dancing.

426
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,720
An other possibility is they were
placed there with religious intent.

427
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,600
Okay, some cultures still put pennies
in the eyes of the dead. Or silver.

428
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,080
The Italians, the Greeks.

429
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,520
Sicilians.

430
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,520
So, what's the "symbology" there?

431
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,240
The "symbology"?

432
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,520
Now that Duffy has relinquished
his King Bonehead crown,

433
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,440
I see we have an heir
to the thrown.

434
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,080
I'm sure the word you were looking for
was "symbolism". What is the symbolism there.

435
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,560
Let me explain it toyou.

436
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,800
In Greek and Roman mythology,

437
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,480
when you died, you'd have
to pay the toll to Charon,

438
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,840
the boatman who ferried you
across to the Gates of Judgment.

439
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,440
This made sure the dead came to at
one for what they did during their lives,

440
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,360
Detective Alapopskalius.

441
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,640
Jesus. You're the frst one
that ever got that.

442
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,560
Yeah, well, I'm an expert
in nameology.

443
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,840
These burns indicate
that they used silencers.

444
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,000
Look at these
entry and exit wounds.

445
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,920
They're almost identical.

446
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,640
The two bullets went in here
through the top of the skull,

447
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,440
crisscrossed, and exited
through the eyeballs.

448
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,280
This one clue tells us
three distinct facts.

449
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,440
- Number one. Duffy?
- They shot him at a downward angle.

450
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,560
- They put him on his knees?
- Excellent. Number two. Greenly.

451
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,760
They shot him
at a downward angle?

452
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,760
It tells us
he was the last to die.

453
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,440
And number three. Dolly.

454
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,360
There was two shooters.

455
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,000
- Fan-freakin'-tastic.
- Hey, wait a minute.

456
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,480
Staywith me, boys.
What did they do...

457
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,400
to make two such
identical wounds?

458
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,400
Two men of similar height
dropped this guy down.

459
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,680
Each puts some iron to his head and boom!
That's all she frickin' wrote.

460
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,640
- What about one guy, two guns?
- Possible.

461
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,240
But unlikely.
The angles are too extreme.

462
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,560
A guy holding two guns to the back of
your noodle is going to shoot straight ahead.

463
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,480
He wouldn't cock out his elbows.
It makes no sense.

464
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,680
Besides, are you telling me
one guy came in here...

465
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,560
and killed eight men with eight
extremely well-aimed shots in just a few seconds?

466
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,120
No way.
It had to be at least two.

467
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,600
You and your fuckin' rope.

468
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,160
- I told you there would be a shaft.
- Just like on television.

469
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,880
Fuck.

470
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,000
Where the fuck are you goin'?

471
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,760
I fuckin' hear some shit out here.

472
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,520
Fuck you. I'm sweatin' my ass off
draggin' your fuckin' rope around.

473
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,720
It must weigh 30 pounds.

474
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,560
We are doin' some serious shit here.
Now, get a fuckin' hold of yourself!

475
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,720
Oh, fuck you! I'm not the rope-totin'
Charlie Bronson wannabe...

476
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,600
- that's gettin' us fuckin' lost.
- Would you fuckin' shut it!

477
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,720
You mother...

478
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,440
- Jesus fuckin' Christ.
- Oh, shit!

479
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,240
Shepherds we shall be
for Thee, my Lord, forThee.

480
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,320
Power hath descended forth
from Thy hand.

481
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,760
Our feet may swiftly
carry out Thy command.

482
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,480
So we shall flow a river forth to Thee,
and teeming with souls shall it ever be.

483
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,480
And I shall count thee
among my favored sheep.

484
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,440
And you shall have the protection
of all the angels in heaven.

485
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,880
Television.

486
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,920
Television is
the explanation for this.

487
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,640
You see this in bad television.

488
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,000
The little assault guys creepin' through
the vents, comin' in through the ceiling.

489
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,800
ThatJames Bond shit never happens in real life.
Professionals don't do that.

490
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,720
Well, name one thing you're gonna need
this stupid fuckin' rope for.

491
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,600
- That was way easier than I thought.
- Aye.

492
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,080
On TV, you've always got that guy
that jumps over the sofa.

493
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,320
- And then you've gotta shoot him for
ten fuckin' minutes too. - Aye.

494
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,480
- We're good.
- Yes, we are.

495
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,000
Now, what do you think
is in that little case there?

496
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,120
Fuck me!

497
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,200
The hits just keep on comin'

498
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,480
Give it a smell.

499
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,880
- I love our new job.

500
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,880
Bastard.
This has got to be his big break.

501
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,120
- Yeah.
- We've got to fuck with him, right?

502
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,040
Okay.

503
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,080
Open the door. I'm gonna
grab him by the fuckin' hair.

504
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,520
Sit down!

505
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,320
- Get down! Shut up!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

506
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,600
- We're on the same side. Please, don't shoot.
- Get on the ground!

507
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,760
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
We're on the same side.

508
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,200
Boss must've sent me in as backup.
I'm Rocco!

509
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,000
- I'm the funny man. That ain't my name.
- Where's your gun?

510
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,000
- Where's your gun? - I'm the fuckin'
funny man! It's right here. Right here.

511
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,840
That ain't my real name.

512
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,320
What the fuck? Jeez!

513
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,080
It's a fuckin' six-shooter!

514
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,400
- There's nine bodies, genius!

515
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,200
What the fuck were you gonna do,
laugh the last three to death, funny man?

516
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,640
Pappa Joe said there was only two!
In and out!

517
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,800
Boy, you guys sure did a good job.

518
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,400
Ah, shit.
You guys are good, huh?

519
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,320
Cool masks.
Where'd you get 'em?

520
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,720
- We gotta do him right here!
- Right now!

521
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,160
- Don't, please! I'm the funny man!
- Right.

522
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,120
- Don't kill me! Don't kill me, please!
- Right!

523
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,040
I'm the funnyman!

524
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,680
Whata fuckin' idiot!

525
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,320
Fuckin'... What the fuckin' fuck...
Who the fuck...

526
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,520
Fuck this fuckin'...
How did you two fuckin' fucks... Fuck!

527
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,880
Well, that certainly illustrates
the diversity of the word.

528
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,080
All these guys are Russian mob.

529
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,000
But not like those two peons
in the alley the other day.

530
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,880
These guys are all syndicate
bosses and underbosses.

531
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,080
I have a dossier
on every man in this room.

532
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,880
Since the Iron Curtain
has gone down,

533
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,600
the Russian syndicates
have started to come here.

534
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,720
And in the spirit of Glasnost, the Soviets
have opened their borders to the Mafia.

535
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,640
But the Italians,
they aren't convinced...

536
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,920
the grounds in Mother Russia are
fertile enough for organized crimeyet.

537
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,120
So they ain't ready to commit.
But the Russians are coming here anyway.

538
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,640
They are unwelcome.

539
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,360
So, what we have here, gentlemen,

540
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,120
is possibly the beginning...

541
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,520
of the frst
international mob war.

542
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,800
Unless I've
totally missed something.

543
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,240
I'm live from
the Copley Plaza Hotel,

544
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,760
where we have just been informed
that the largest multiple murder...

545
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,040
in Boston's history
has just taken place.

546
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,160
We have learned that
there were nine victims,

547
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,480
all deeply involved in a notoriously
violent Russian crime syndicate,

548
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,400
right here in Boston.

549
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,000
Any body you think is evil?

550
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,200
Aye.

551
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,720
Don't you think that's
a little weird, a little psycho?

552
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,320
Do you know what I think
is psycho, Roc?

553
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,880
It's decent men
with loving families.

554
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,760
They go home every day after work,
and they turn on the news.

555
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,320
You know what they see?
They see rapists...

556
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,440
and murderers
and child molesters.

557
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,360
They're all gettin'
out ofprison.

558
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,280
Mafiosos...

559
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,480
gettin' caught
with 20 kilos...

560
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,480
gettin' out on bail
the same fuckin' day.

561
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,000
And everywhere,
everyone thinks the same thing...

562
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,000
that someone should just
go kill those motherfuckers.

563
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,640
Kill 'em all.
Admit it.

564
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,880
Even you've thought about it.

565
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,200
You guys should be
in every major city.

566
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,560
This is some heavy shit.

567
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,480
This is like
"Lone Ranger" heavy, man.

568
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:05,160
Fuck it! There's so much shit
that pisses me off!

569
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,560
You guys should recruit, 'cause
I'm sick and fuckin' tired...

570
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,800
of walkin' down the street
wait in' for one of these crack-pipin',

571
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,120
ass-wipin', motherless
low lifes to get me!

572
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,320
Hallelujah, Jaffar.

573
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,280
So you're not just talkin'
about mob guys, right?

574
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,880
You're talkin' about pimps and
drug dealers and all that shit, right?

575
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,640
Oh, yeah.

576
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,720
Fuck. You guys could
do this every goddamn day.

577
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,400
We're sort oflike 7-Eleven.

578
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,840
We're not always doin' business,
but we're always open.

579
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,840
- That is nicely put.
- Thank you very much.

580
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,880
I will fuck you up, dude.

581
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,600
So then we go right through
the fuckin' ceiling like this...

582
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:13,720
Oh, boy. You fuckin' guys.
You ruined me.

583
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,360
I'm fuckin' done.

584
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,440
Permanent fuckin' package boy.

585
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,360
Who said that?
You can take credit on that, you know?

586
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,680
What, are you serious?

587
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,600
Yeah. Fuck it.

588
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,800
If you think about it,
it's all you can do, really.

589
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,840
I mean, you can't goin there
and tell him it was us.

590
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,840
Climb the corporate
ladder, boy.

591
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,760
Don Rocco.

592
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,040
Fuck it.

593
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,960
I'm doin' it.
I deserve it.

594
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,920
I've been workin' for those fat bastards
since I've been in high school.

595
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,960
Look at this fuckin' place.
They're fuckin' me, man.

596
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,040
They can suck
my pathetic little dick!

597
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,560
And I'll dip my nuts
in marinara sauce...

598
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,200
just so the fat bastards can get
a taste of home while they're at it.

599
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,520
Fuck it! I'm doin'it.

600
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,240
It is done!
Shit!

601
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,440
- Shit! Shit!
- Oh, my God!

602
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,480
- What the fuck!
- I'm hit!

603
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,400
Oh, fuck!

604
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,640
What the fuck!

605
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,880
I can't believe
that just fuckin' happened!

606
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,080
- Is it dead?
- Oh, my God!

607
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,760
Donna's gonna be angry
about her cat.

608
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,280
Shit.

609
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,640
She's on every drug
known to man.

610
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,960
She'd have sold the thing
for a dime bag. Screw her.

611
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,280
I do kind of feel
like an asshole, though.

612
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,600
Yeah, Roc, you sound
real remorseful there.

613
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,680
She ain't been around
in weeks anyhow.

614
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,400
Listen, something's been
botherin' me about last night.

615
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,200
What?

616
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,000
What if your boss knew how many
fellows were supposed to be there?

617
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,000
- What are you... What are you sayin'?
- Think about it.

618
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,280
Nine men, six bullets.

619
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,400
Think they sold me out?
No way. No way.

620
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,760
Listen, he probably knew
you'd end up nailin' the fat guy,

621
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,760
maybe one or two more, but he had
to know you weren't walkin' out of there.

622
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,160
Figure it out.
The shooter's dead at the scene.

623
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,080
There's no
in-depth investigation.

624
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,440
They'll just slide right off
his fuckin' back.

625
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,400
'Cause what the fuck?

626
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,720
As much as I love you, man,
you are not exactly Don Corleone.

627
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,640
No, no, that...

628
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,800
That's just not the way things are done.
Besides, how does he know...

629
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,720
I just don't get in there, see there's
too many of 'em, serve 'em their fuckin' food...

630
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,720
Because he fuckin'
knows you, Roc!

631
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,040
A smooth hitter would have gone in there,
seen it was a fuckin' wash and slipped out.

632
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,200
But you, he knows
this is your only shot.

633
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,520
You've been waitin'
18 fuckin' years.

634
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,640
No. No, no. That...

635
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,600
Thatjust ain't the way...
No, that's bullshit.

636
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,640
You don't know what you're talkin' about.
That's just not the way things happen.

637
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,680
I mean, thanks for your concern and all,
but that just ain't the thing of it.

638
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,080
Do me a favor, all right?
Just roll it around a bit on your way in.

639
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,040
- Will you for me?
- No. No rollin'.

640
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,360
Nothin' needs to be rolled.
Fuck!

641
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,000
- Where the fuck are you goin'? Did you tell him?
- Of course I fuckin' told him.

642
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,360
- Then what the fuck?
- You guys don't know that shit for sure!

643
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,280
You're such a fuckin' retard!

644
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,600
- Hey, fuck you!
- Oh, man, use your fuckin' brain for once!

645
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,760
Is it so unbelievable that
they don't fuckin' care about ya?

646
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,160
Oh, yeah, you two fuckin' Micks
know what's goin' on?

647
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,360
- Fuck you both! - This is not a fuckin'
thing you should gamble on, all right?

648
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,400
I'm the fuck out of here.

649
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,320
Fine! Fuck it!

650
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,040
What kind of flowers you want
at your funeral, you dumb wop?

651
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,320
- It's the last time I'm gonna see ya!
- I'll be back at nine!

652
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,640
- Bury the fuckin' cat!
- Listen, you get in there...

653
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,120
and you start gettin' a bad vibe,
you get the fuck out quick!
