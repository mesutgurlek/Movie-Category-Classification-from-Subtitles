1
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,236
Have you seen Francis?
-No, not lately.

2
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,994
It has been a while, right?

3
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,637
The social worker asked you
to come by.

4
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,758
Shut up. I don앖 have the
right to anything.

5
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,109
There is mail for you.
Should I bring it?

6
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,112
You have been gone for 5 days.
Don앖 you want to live together anymore?

7
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,956
Because I go out late, I don앖
want to move yet. Stop whyning.

8
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,999
Did you come here to drink something,
we haven앖 talked in a while.

9
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,399
Have you got any money?
-Yes, I앏l buy. Where are we going?

10
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,512
Give up, I앏l play again.

11
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,877
You know that girl?
-Sure. A first class whore.

12
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,190
I believe that immediately.
Can앖 you introduce me to her?

13
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,351
Nadine, phone for you.
It압 Francis.

14
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,559
Don앖 stand there like that,
I앏l lose my concentration.

15
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,513
Will you be late tonight?
-I don앖 know. Stop whyning.

16
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,309
There압 nobody here.

17
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,593
It압 a week now.
Its ok.

18
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,873
Manu...

19
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,918
Manu, come please.
Where is Radouan?

20
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,989
Where is Radouan?
-Come here.

21
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,033
Are you watching that junk
again?

22
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,589
I thought you wouldn앖 come to eat.
-Shut down that tv.

23
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,398
You are totally insane.
If you were a guy...

24
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,998
Go to the kitchen.

25
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,596
I want to finger myself here.
I have had enough of doing it in my room.

26
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,237
Where are the papers?
-In the basket.

27
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,756
Do you smoke nowadays?
-No, it압 for you.

28
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,837
A gift from King Radouan.

29
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,556
Do you deal like your brother, fucking Radouan?
-Relax.

30
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,477
I am relaxed.
But the whole neighbourhood is talking about it.

31
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,992
You are so scared that the cops
will arest you.

32
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,073
He압 not the type
to jump at everything.

33
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,748
Something happened between us.

34
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,713
I shouldn앖 have done
it immediately the first night.

35
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,992
I don앖 understand
why he doesn앖 call back.

36
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,668
I think he압 affraid of me.

37
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,754
A girl with character scares men.
They feel less virile.

38
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,753
They are all sissies, that압 what they are.

39
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,515
Manu, come please.

40
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,915
You haven앖 seen Radouan?
-No. We don앖 live together.

41
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,069
Tell that dick that he압 wanted.
When we find him, he압 dead.

42
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,678
What did he do wrong?
-When we find that dick, he압 dead.

43
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,193
it압 ok.

44
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,148
Don앖 talk like that
or you will die!

45
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,150
No jokes, we will come and
find you. Understand? Fuck off now.

46
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,079
Do you still have some stuff?
-Or did you smoke everything?

47
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,312
Bah, you really are hopeless.

48
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,269
Are we going to drink something?

49
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,637
Have you got any money?
-I just got my welfare.

50
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,117
Are you French enough
to get that? 

51
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,474
I'm going to my brother's.
-I don앖 want to see him.

52
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,999
What are you still doing
with that damn junkie?

53
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,152
Can앖 you do anything
with your shitty life?

54
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,595
Mind your own business.

55
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,031
There are always problems with you.
You are a piece of shit.

56
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,153
Can you lend me 300 francs?
-Your are daring.

57
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,796
Work. You know what that is?
-There's no work in France.

58
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,433
Thanks.

59
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,190
Come, lets go.
-Did you get hit, Manu?

60
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,871
You saw that. So what?
-You should have hit back.

61
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,112
I wouldn't take something like that.
-I am prepared for anything.

62
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,554
We will buy some beer and 
go for a stroll on the quay.

63
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,239
You want me to come?

64
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,474
Yes, that would be nice.

65
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,799
There are some things...
I need to talk to you about.

66
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,714
Maybe you can tell me what
I have to do.

67
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,917
I have an importane meeting
now...

68
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,238
...but I will ask what time the
last train leaves.

69
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,472
OK.
-You will give me the address?

70
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,519
Juvisy, H進el de la Gare.
You can앖 miss it.

71
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,070
They have seen your porn movies.

72
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,871
With all those nice details,
I think it압 gross.

73
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,676
You help everybody,
then you have to hear something like that.

74
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,516
If you didn앖 want to tell it,
you should have shut up.

75
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,116
I앇 rather have you know it.
-Well, I know it now.

76
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,233
I could care less.
Shit on them.

77
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,549
Bring them to me, I앏l make 
them stand in a row and shit on them.

78
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,595
Give me a beer..

79
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,078
You want to be a rebel?

80
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,474
Shall I show you what
I do to rebels?

81
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,992
You haven앖 had enough yet?

82
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,831
Stay down.

83
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,276
Take her out of there.

84
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,519
Lets go!

85
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,592
Take off your pants.
Strip or I'll kill you.

86
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,036
Exchange?

87
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,392
Turn around. On your hands and knees.
Hurry.

88
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,396
Shut up.

89
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,677
It압 like I am fucking a zombie.

90
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,520
Move your ass a bit.

91
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,399
What do you think you have
between your legs, asshole?

92
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,831
I았e had enough. Bitch.

93
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,032
Manu. How could you?...
How could you let him take you like that?

94
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,996
How could you, Manu?

95
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,471
They can have done much worse.

96
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,709
Were still alive, right?

97
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,391
How can you say that?
How can you say that?!

98
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,879
Because I don앖 care about
their stupid dicks.

99
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,594
I have had more in me.

100
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,158
You wouldn앖 leave your car behind
with valuable stuff in it either.

101
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,116
I can앖 keep dicks out of my pussy,
there압 nothing valuable in there.

102
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,272
It압 only a dick and were only
girls. It will be alright.

103
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,471
Damnit.

104
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,635
I will make you come.

105
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,678
You are touching my whiskey without
asking and you didn앖 even put it back.

106
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,400
Be happy there압 still something in it.

107
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,552
It압 always the same.
With everything I say,

108
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,870
you give stupid answers.

109
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,192
If you want to live together,
there has to be dialog and respect.

110
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,432
And you can앖 cope with that.

111
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,393
You really don앖 have some stuff?

112
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,910
What압 up with you?
Don앖 you have enough of being down?

113
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,912
Will you give me a Jack?
-No.

114
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,999
Come on.

115
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,351
Here you go, little princess.

116
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,950
Damnit asshole.

117
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,953
Kill him.

118
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,319
Waste him.

119
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,710
Stop it. It압 a poor guy.
-mind your own business.

120
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,872
Fuckers. Don앖 you see he압
a poor guy?

121
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,032
Don앖 you see he압 whyning?
Is he your sweetheart?

122
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,668
Do we have to waste you too,
bitch?

123
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,396
Leave her alone. Understood?
I will only tell you once... ok?

124
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,751
You, come here.
-No. I don앖 want that. They will kill him.

125
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,079
Come here.

126
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,596
Hurry up,
Mother Teresa.

127
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,150
Your big friend Francis called.

128
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,632
What do you see in that dirty junk?
-What did he say?

129
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,635
Nothing. He was totally stoned.
And I don앖 want to see him anymore.

130
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,995
When did he call?

131
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,516
He will be here for a few days
and then he앏l squat for 3 weeks.

132
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,434
He makes a mess, eats everything
and spills coffee everywhere.

133
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,114
And he shouts at me too.

134
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,669
He압 whining because I threw his
stuff away...

135
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,038
...because when he doesn앖 have enough speed,
he wants to filter it twice

136
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,199
I don앖 want to see him again.
-Please, be quiet now.

137
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,958
Stop it please.

138
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,039
Youre a fucking idiot.

139
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,835
How did you get those bruises?

140
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,029
From dickheads like you.
They always like to hit me...

141
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,794
...otheriwse they don앖 feel alive.

142
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,909
Did you have a fight again?
Youre always stoned.

143
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,069
They didn앖 rape you, right?

144
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,473
You haven앖 been raped, right?!

145
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,520
Who?
-That guy is a real pain in the ass.

146
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,831
He압 my best friend,
shut your fucking mouth.

147
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,913
Your best friend?
And you are his best slave...

148
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,198
...and he doesn앖 give a shit about you.
Your best friend.

149
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,439
Who was it?
Who did it?

150
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,231
It doesn앖 even come to your
mind, to ask how I am doing.

151
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,188
You are so dumb you make me puke.

152
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,477
You don앖 look th磬 traumatized.
Damnit, you make me puke.

153
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,912
Slut..... Slut.

154
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,079
Good evening.

155
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,357
Can I have the number of Francis Godot압
room?

156
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,478
Number 26, second floor.

157
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,156
He only payed for 1 person.

158
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,075
I only come for the evening blowjob.

159
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,756
How is it going?
-I am without Subutex.

160
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,278
Basic stuff.

161
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,792
Can you make a nice prescription for me
with nice...

162
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,837
...handwriting.

163
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,918
The above right, three boxes of eight.

164
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,677
I know. I have done it so many times
I know it by heart.

165
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,879
Didn앖 be rude on the prescription. 
That will cause suspicion.

166
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,108
Now is not the time to 
whine to me about that.

167
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,071
There압 something I really can앖
forget. Do you remember No泄le?

168
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,872
You know how she rode her
bike over the border, full of acid.

169
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,437
I have to get her false papers,
but I can앖 get them.

170
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,311
I have to be at the Luxeuil station 
buffet on the 13th at 12 o앆lock.

171
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,829
Where압 that?
-In the Vosges.

172
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,315
First class.
But I can앖 be there.

173
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,751
You have to give her the papers.

174
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,630
She압 driving across the border,
with the stuff, her acid.

175
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,231
You have to take care of it.

176
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,279
Now a days there are enough
people with problems.

177
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,797
I am going downstairs for a while and my...
Thank you.

178
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,879
It압 nice of you to come.
-That압 normal, isn앖 it?

179
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,077
Have you seen it...

180
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,718
...there압 pharmacy near the hotel.

181
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,270
You know how to choose good hotels.

182
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,589
I am asking you something.

183
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,872
At the moment there are no trains.
Insane.

184
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,679
This is going to be a long night.

185
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,193
Fuck, no trains till tomorrow
night.

186
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,352
You aren앖 very social...
Where are you going?

187
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,391
To Paris.

188
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,391
To Paris?

189
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,919
Can you drive a car?
-Yes.

190
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,157
If you can drive, I have a car.
And I want to go to Paris.

191
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,155
Will you wait for me in Paris?
-Not really.

192
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,189
That압 convenient.

193
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,240
That압 very convenient.

194
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,911
I am in a very shitty position.

195
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,508
I bet you'll say again that
youre having bad luck.

196
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,196
I want to see the sea. Take me there.

197
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,712
That압 what the car is for,
with gas to go back again.

198
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,073
Can I ask you something?
-What?

199
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,356
Have you done any porno movies?

200
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,148
Yes. How did you know?
Is your boyfriend a fan?

201
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,029
I don앖 have a boyfriend.
I'm crazy about it myself.

202
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,954
That압 one point for you.

203
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,595
God damn. I'm thirsty.
Stop please, I have to drink.

204
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,791
Further down the road is a gas
station - There's the sign.

205
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,592
Good news.

206
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,628
But you better not do something
to me.

207
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,638
I really won앖 do anything.

208
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,712
If you want, you can take the car
now and drive away.

209
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,275
I am going to eat. And you?

210
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,990
I don앖 know. Eat with you.

211
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,877
Funny how we met eachother,
isn' it?

212
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,315
No, it압 not funny at all.
It was now or never.

213
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,554
We can see it like that too.
-We can go on a journey.

214
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,590
With your 10,000 Francs?
-I don앖 want to go anywhere.

215
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,678
And I have to be in the Vosges 
on the 13th.

216
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,715
I don앖 want to screw No梭le.

217
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,433
We can stay together till then.

218
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,556
Too bad for her.
-Damn, I am scared.

219
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,077
What a funny feeling.

220
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,478
It압 going pretty fast actually.

221
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,559
You were standing to close to me. 
I could have shot off your arm.

222
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,269
Because of that experience were
getting better.

223
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,875
What did you think about it?

224
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,359
Immediately afterwards I felt bad.
Really bad.

225
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,513
I wanted to sit down and cry,
end of the world atmosphere.

226
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,557
But now...

227
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,754
...I feel very good.
I would almost feel like doing it...

228
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,150
Again, right?

229
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,635
Awkward.
We don앖 know if they are looking for us.

230
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,519
Don't forget that 
cops are stupid by nature.

231
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:37,151
But they're also very diligent.
And we weren앖 very cautious either.

232
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,191
You have to be sharp.

233
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,439
From now on we have to drink a lot.

234
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,591
And catch some guys.

235
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,633
The more you fuck...

236
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,679
The less you think and
the better you sleep.

237
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,595
What would be fun...

238
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,548
...is if you do 69 with us.

239
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,311
Fuck off.

240
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:25,276
Did you see how that dick went down.
With his expensive suit. Hello... Boom.

241
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,748
The face he made.
-Stupid fuck.

242
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,438
Where are we going?
-How would I know.

243
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,230
Where luck takes us.

244
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,077
And we앏l let the "you can fuck off" 
side of our souls go it압 own way

245
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,876
I have cut myself everywhere.
-It압 crazy like that.

246
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,669
You don앖 know anything, it압 cool.

247
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,478
We are far from the Vosges.
We have to be there at the 13th.

248
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,310
What do we have to do there?
It압 far away, it압 cold and ugly.

249
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,592
We have an appointment there
with No泄le, right?

250
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,871
Yes, I forgot.

251
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,998
I would advise you to use the Beretta 92f, 
with the Pachmayr grip, totally stainless steel.

252
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,550
It압 one of my favouite guns.

253
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,110
It압 very virile.
I think it압 great.

254
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,272
You push the magazine deep
into the end...

255
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,996
...you pull the sledge back,
unbolt on the side.

256
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,595
And the gun is ready to fire.

257
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,635
Remember to push the magazine
into the end hard.

258
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,156
Pull the sledge and unbolt 
on the side.

259
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,868
And if your husband....

260
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,958
And if his wife
likes to shoot dickheads?

261
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,872
We don앖 have the right answers
at the right time.

262
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,350
But we do have the right actions.
That압 a start.

263
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,076
And we aren앖 doing it that bad.

264
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,439
No. But those people are going to die.

265
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:27,033
The dialogs need to have some level.
Crucial to death.

266
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,875
Will we prepare some lines?
-Ofcourse not.

267
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,153
Then we wouldn앖 have any ethics.

268
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,557
Don앖 forget to buy some drinks.

269
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,273
Did you buy drinks?
-Yes.

270
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,074
As a kid I spilled my drinks on 
purpose to get my mom mad.

271
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,589
She got sick of it.

272
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,957
Damn, I am getting anxious to fuck.

273
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,273
Thanks.

274
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,835
Youre not playing?

275
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,471
You want some coins?

276
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,313
You will bring me some luck.

277
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:05,673
Only your dick, nothing else.
-But that압 dumb. Safe sex.

278
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,791
Can앖 do that anymore.

279
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,990
I can앖 do this.
It압 against my principles.

280
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,871
You can앖 get it hard.
That압 boring.

281
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,669
I don앖 know what압 wrong.

282
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,431
Maybe if you do it with your
mouth for once...

283
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,079
You are lucky I have a female
concious, pal.

284
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,350
Bitch.

285
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,796
That압 filthy.

286
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,033
I don앖 get what압 so funny about that.
Damnit.

287
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,353
I chocked myself..

288
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,632
Bitches.

289
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,349
Filthy fucking whores.

290
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,958
I didn앖 say you could leave.

291
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,032
What we didn앖 like about you,
was your condom.

292
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,239
You have been revealed, pal.
Your a condom dick.

293
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,156
You can앖 just go around fucking
unknown girls.

294
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,313
Because you never know who 
your dealing... pal

295
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,193
With killers of condom-dicks.

296
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,717
Yuck... Terror in the city.
-Is our picture included?

297
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,398
No one will recognize us
with that.

298
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:22,318
We are just two girls,
one big and one small.

299
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,196
Do you want to feel my balls
against your ass?

300
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,557
Fucking bastard.

301
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,680
Do you know the way to Biarritz?

302
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,954
No, I don앖 see the signs.
You앏l have to tell me the way.

303
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,989
Me? Are you crazy? Just drive.
I have to tell you.

304
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,031
Will you just leave me like that?

305
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,876
Hello. Can we get a room?

306
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,668
The best looking room.
-The best...

307
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,716
There압 no better room.

308
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,152
Are there drinks in the room?
-No, but we have drinks down here.

309
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,357
How much?
-For the best room? 800 Francs.

310
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,397
This is a nice Hotel. Very nice.

311
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,193
OK...

312
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,035
See you later maybe.

313
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,551
Don앖 you think it압 weird
that nothing is happening?

314
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,790
You always have strange thoughts
about "nothing happening".

315
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,755
That we are sitting in a hotel
doing nothing after all this.

316
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,629
Like everything is allowed.

317
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,716
Tactically, it압 not good to
think about things like that.

318
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,348
Right.
We have to remain mentally strong.

319
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,513
Why not start ruining your
Jack with Coke.

320
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,436
I do what I want.

321
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,518
Excuse me....

322
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,630
I am thisty.
You are thirsty? You want a beer?

323
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,833
Good evening.
One beer, please.

324
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,918
Good evening.

325
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,672
Where are you going?

326
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,798
To the room.
-I am going with you.

327
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,030
Thanks, bye.

328
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,431
Damnit.

329
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,790
Too bad for them.

330
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,430
Good evening.
-Gendarmerie.

331
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,712
Do you have your license and registration?
-Ofcourse

332
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,833
They should be in my purse.

333
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,278
Sorry.

334
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,233
I hope you are not leaving me?
I also know who you are.

335
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,195
For being on the run like this,
you don앖 look that scared.

336
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,438
That압 because of our shortage
of fantasy.

337
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,677
You are going too far.

338
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,389
Everyone is scared to die or
to end up in prison.

339
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,950
It압 not about that.
Nobody escapes from it.

340
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:27,750
I don앖 know, but on tv
they said you shot a man...

341
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,394
...and a woman without a reason.

342
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,870
Does it have a better morals
if we want money?

343
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,273
We don앖 have extenuating
circumstances.

344
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,078
If I would have met you on the bus,
I wouldn앖 have wondered that much.

345
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,993
That압 the ultimate trick.

346
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,115
Come, girl... Come on.

347
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,429
We are going to bed.

348
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,313
Are you coming?

349
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,550
Are we going to bed?

350
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,590
Good night, girls.
-See you tomorrow.

351
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,476
He reminds me very much
of my brother.

352
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,718
Reminds me of the house
we will get sometime.

353
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,433
Thank you.

354
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,432
You too?

355
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,592
Why don앖 you go passed the border?

356
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,272
Too silly. And what would we
do somewhere else?

357
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,114
I don앖 believe is somewhere else.

358
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,149
You can앖 just sit here without
doing anything. That can앖 be.

359
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,799
Yes it can.

360
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:18,033
You can앖 just wait 
untill they catch you.

361
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,439
I am hesitating between jumping
from something or burning alive.

362
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,629
But to just sacrifice yourself
is too arrogant.

363
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:44,756
After our first meeting in Vosges
I vote for a jump without a cord.

364
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,433
It압 a miracle that were
still here.

365
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,235
I want to end it just as good
as it all started.

366
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,393
A joke has to have a good
point.

367
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:02,873
You will have to push me before
the jump. I앐 too affraid.

368
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,231
I don앖 get it.

369
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,077
Don앖 worry, I will push you.

370
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,717
We should write the press
a letter too.

371
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,520
"They jumped without a cord."

372
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:22,840
Or else they will just make up something.
-Yes, communication is important.

373
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,510
Concentrate.
I don앖 have all day.

374
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,477
Now I missed it.

375
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,950
Concentrate please.

376
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,469
Don앖 talk to me like that.
You think your brave?

377
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:45,553
What kind of guy is it?
-An asshole. I am glad you are paying him a visit.

378
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,474
Did he do something to you?
-Getting on my nerves.

379
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,036
I wouldn앖 gladly get
on your nerves.

380
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,749
And the volt is there.

381
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,238
The dick lives in a huge castle.

382
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,709
Good morning.
-Hello, sir.

383
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,357
We work for the inquiry firm Lpsos.

384
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:56,230
Would you be so kind to answer some
questions about culture-consumption?

385
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,318
Sure. Come in.
-Thank you.

386
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,553
There we go.

387
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,593
I am ready.

388
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,275
Then we can start immediately.

389
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:26,072
I don앖 have a tv,
but I have heard about you.

390
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,033
I had someone else in my mind though.

391
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:40,031
I wouldn앖 have expected
to meet you either.

392
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:44,950
I won앖 ask how you know me.
-That would be misplaced.

393
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,509
I don앖 know anyone like you.

394
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,152
You must be different than others.

395
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,395
What you do, is...

396
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,640
...extremely violent.

397
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:07,314
You must have suffered very much
to become violent like that.

398
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,752
I don앖 know what you went
through...

399
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,834
...and I don앖 know why 
I trust you.

400
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:26,194
Open the safe, pal.
-You are an open book to me.

401
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,109
I would be glad to make a deal
with you.

402
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,909
Get out of the way, asshole.

403
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:41,637
Unbelievable what he was talking
about before he opened that damn safe.

404
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,356
You already look a lot worse,
fucker.

405
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,914
No, I won앖 kill you.
-Thank you.

406
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,513
Hey, sis...

407
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,235
...kill that son of a bitch.

408
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,119
Good evening.

409
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:20,198
Champagne, please.
-Later.

410
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:30,200
I will have a walk around
-Here.

411
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,998
Fuck off.
Keep your dirty hands off me!

412
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,036
This a fuck club here,
not a Mosque.

413
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,478
Act like a pig, dickhead.

414
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,472
Act like a pig!

415
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,477
Strip those pants.

416
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,554
Yes, they must have coffee.

417
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,077
And with a little luck,
we will get some bread too.

418
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,192
Then we can stay together.

419
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:33,153
This is not the moment to give up.
I can앖 use that.

420
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,275
Don앖 move!

421
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:59,477
Where is she?
-Back off, nothing to see here.

422
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,200
Don앖 move.
-Please move back.

423
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,589
Don앖 move.

424
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,194
Where압 your friend?
where is your damn friend?
