Car 2-1-1-8.
Call Greenpoint Hospital

3
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:15,991
and tell them we're bringing in
a wounded cop.

4
00:01:16,158 --> 00:01:19,286
'All right. 10-4. Thanks a lot.'

(Phone rings)

6
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,296
8th Precinct. Yeah.

7
00:01:32,424 --> 00:01:34,468
Jesus Christ.

8
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:46,104
Guess who got shot.

9
00:01:48,148 --> 00:01:50,192
Serpico.

10
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,529
Do you think a cop did it?

11
00:01:54,696 --> 00:01:56,823
I know six cops said they'd like to.

12
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,201

- Hello?
- 'Sidney? '

00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:18,804
New York Times.
Serpico's been shot.

16
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:21,014
Oh, my God!

17
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:23,850
- 'They're taking him to Greenpoint.'
- I'll see you there.

(Man) 'To be a police officer means
to believe in the law'

and to enforce it impartially,
respecting the equality of all men

21
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:02,324
and the dignity and worth
of every individual.

22
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:07,204
Every day, your life will be on the line.

23
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:09,414
And also your character.

24
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:13,460
You'll need integrity, courage, honesty,

25
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:16,255
compassion, courtesy,

26
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:19,883
perseverance and patience.

27
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:25,222
You men are now prepared
to join the war against crime

28
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:29,268
and put the theory you have learned
into practice in the streets.

29
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:43,699
- Same time, same place, both reports.
- I already made out a full report.

30
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:45,909
- Are you covering this, Lieutenant?
- Yes, Chief Green.

31
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:50,122
- Who was with Serpico?
- Heinemann and Julio.

32
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:54,626
I want them interrogated. I want this
conducted as an official investigation.

33
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:57,087
Transcripts by 9:00 am.

34
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:11,935
- And I want a 24-hour guard on Serpico.
- Yes, sir.

35
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:14,146
You two, over there.

Frankie!

41

Frankie!

42
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,443
Come on, Marianne wants a good shot.

43
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,282
Get closer!

44
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,059
Sir?

45
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:20,439
Upstairs. See the roll call man.

46
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,540
Take a map and memorise
your post and sectors.

47
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:40,751
This week you're 8:00 to 4:00.

48
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:45,047
Grab an empty locker. Any questions,
the older guys will help. Good luck.

49
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:10,197
Yo! 8:00! Let's go! Come on.
Gather round. Let's go.

50
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:13,492
All right. Settle down.

51
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:20,499
There's just a few announcements today,
and two new men.

52
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,044
On the board on my left
you see Squad One, Blue Sector.

53
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:28,131
Squad Two, Red Sector.
Squad Three, Green Sector.

54
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:32,928
We want summonses,
summonses, summonses.

55
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:37,307
- This is Frank Serpico, Charlie.
- Hello, Frank.

56
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:39,810
- How about some cream chicken?
- Sounds good to me.

57
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:44,147
No, I think I'll have...
how about a roast beef on a roll?

58
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:52,239
Yeah, OK. You go through the line.
I'll bring it over.

59
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:58,328
Peluce, it's all fat here.

60
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,502
- I saw real lean beef over there.
- Take it easy. Sit down.

61
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:10,465
- What's the matter?
- Don't be so fussy. It's free.

62
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:13,802
I'm not fussy but I don't know
how I'm going to eat this.

63
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:18,557
Charlie's an OK guy. We give him a break
on double-parking on deliveries.

64
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:25,314
Couldn't I pay for it, get what I want?

65
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:31,528
Frank, generally you just sort of take
what Charlie gives you.

66
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:41,705
'Sector D, David, 10-34,
possible rape in progress.

67
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:45,667
'Vicinity of PS 2-18,
Grand Avenue and BQ Expressway.'

68
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:54,801
- Becker, aren't we going to take that?
- Relax, Frank. It's not our sector.

69
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,679
It's on the borderline.

70
00:09:57,846 --> 00:09:59,890
I'm gonna take it.

71
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,185
D Sector, 15-47, 10-4.

72
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:36,301
(Woman) Oh, my God!

73
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,141
Hold it! Hold it! Police officer!

74
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:46,103
Oh, shit!

75
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,231
Don't shoot. Be cool.

76
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:53,902
All right. OK. Put your guns away.
Put your guns away now.

77
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:57,823
Come on!
I said put the motherfucking guns away!

78
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,033
I'll cut her, goddamn it.

79
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,289
Turn the motherfucking light out, man.

80
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:10,752
I'll cut her, man. I'll cut her.
You just be cool, goddamn it.

81
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,297
Just be cool. All right.

82
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:16,466
All right. All right. That's it.

83
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,535
Other one... took his thing out.

84
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,790
He put it up to my mouth.

85
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:53,545
He held me down.

86
00:11:55,672 --> 00:12:00,218
They said if I didn't do it... they'd kill me.

87
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:10,854
- She's gonna make a helluva witness.
- Would you like a stretcher?

88
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,828
Muscles, he's all yours.
I'll call you from the hospital.

89
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:17,671
OK. Who were your playmates?

90
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:29,141
- Hey, Frank, do you want a piece of this?
- No. I'll fill out the arrest card.

91
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,582
Hey, Charlie.
Let me have five minutes with him?

92
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,001
- Sure.
- Thanks.

93
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,925
Thank you, Charlie.

94
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,560
That prick really worked you over.
How do you feel?

95
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:18,482
- How come you didn't stay for the fun?
- That's not my kind of fun.

96
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:29,785
I want to talk to you.
I want to get you a cup of coffee.

97
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,496
Without cuffs.

98
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:38,126
Now, look.
I didn't touch you upstairs, right?

99
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:42,673
You take off on me,
I'll put one in your back. Understand?

100
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,885
Come on.

101
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,351
Goddamn shame you're gonna
take this whole rap yourself.

102
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,274
Maybe you're guilty, maybe you're not.

103
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:06,238
Maybe you just went along for the ride.
I got a feeling you did.

104
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,995
You're the one who got caught.
You never even got your cock out.

105
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:16,498
- Put it in the report.
- It's in the report.

106
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,423
Look at you.

107
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,718
- I can't eat.
- No, you can't.

108
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,098
I don't understand you, you know that?

109
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,935
What are you, obligated to those guys?
Fuck it!

110
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,355
They left you holding the bag.
You don't owe them nothing.

111
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,486
They're gonna put you away,
you know that?

112
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:48,697
What can I get?

113
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,412
Let's see. Kidnapping. Sodomy. Rape.

114
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,957
Are you kidding me?

115
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,711
Here.

116
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,383
You talk to me. Save yourself.

117
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:31,365
You're not going to send someone over?
McCoy, I get one, I'll lose the other.

118
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:36,828
Look, Serpico, that's Muscle's case.
He's off for a few days. I can't cut it.

119
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:39,581
- They're here now!
- 'Lt'll keep.'

120
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,792
No, it won't.

121
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,363
Police officer! Hold it!
Hold it! Turn around!

122
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:21,039
Come on, man. Come on.
Please take that gun from my head.

123
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,208
Turn around slowly.

124
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,475
We'll take it from here.
You don't have to hang around.

125
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:46,273
What are you talking about?
That's my collar.

126
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,319
We take the collar.

127
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:53,614
A collar like this, it don't look good
if a patrolman takes it.

128
00:17:53,780 --> 00:18:00,120
I don't care how it looks. I did the work.
I broke my ass on this. It's my collar.

129
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,540
You really want the collar?
You can be brought up on charges.

130
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,460
You left your post, you left the street,

131
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:11,506
entered the schoolyard without permission,
that's just for openers. Right, Penella?

132
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:16,261
No memo entry? Shit, you'd be lucky
to end up with a reprimand.

133
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,097
We'll give you an assist on the arrest, kid.

134
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,442
Jim, get out of the way.
What are you doing over there?

135
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,030
What do you want me to do?
Cross the street?

136
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,092
- Hey, Frankie.
- Hi!

137
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:03,475
- Hey, Pasquale.
- Hey, Frankie. How you doin'?

138
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:08,814
- OK. How you doin'? Where's Pop?
- Be back in a half hour. How's it going?

139
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,149
- OK. I've come to get my shoes.
- Yeah.

140
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,818
Warm it up! Warm it up!

141
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,657
- Oh, here they are.
- Frankie, how you doin'?

142
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,244
OK. Good job.
You people do good work here.

143
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,832
So... how you doin', Frankie?

144
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,168
You keep asking me that.
What's the matter with you? I'm doing OK.

145
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,046
I thought you were coming over
Saturday night.

146
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,133
I'm sorry, Pasquale. I couldn't make it.

147
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,262
Margaret invited Marianne over.
Marianne was very disappointed.

148
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,557
Nah, look. I don't like that.

149
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:48,562
Don't invite people over if you're not sure
I'm gonna come. I mean it now.

150
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,357
- If I want to see Marianne, I'll call her.
- What's going on with you two?

151
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,279
Hey, Pasquale.
I'm going to tell you something.

152
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,950
All day long I work with cops. Right?

153
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,578
Now when I go out, I see Marianne,

154
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,540
her father's a cop, her brother's a cop,
her uncle's a cop.

155
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,959
I got a feeling she's a cop.

156
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,171
Come here. How you doin' on the job?

157
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:20,135
- It's got its problems.
- Mama tells me you need an apartment.

158
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,346
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

159
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,556
Where are you going?

160
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,601
I don't know.
I'm looking around by the school.

161
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,063
- NYU? Greenwich Village?
- Yeah, Greenwich Village.

162
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:34,191
- This neighbourhood's not good enough?
- Tell Pop I was here.

163
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:39,279
- Yeah. Frankie! Sunday?
- Sunday what?

164
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,573
Dinner. Huh?

165
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,993
- Do me one favour.
- I know, I know. No Marianne.

166
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,830
All right, a couple of announcements.

167
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,793
Announcing a course in fingerprint
identification at John Jay College.

168
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,880
The course will be available to patrolmen
who wish to make themselves eligible

169
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,592
for assignment to
the Bureau of Criminal Identification, BCI,

170
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:05,931
which is a path to a detective's gold shield.
Signed Captain McGuire.

171
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,142
On the board on my left,
you'll see Squad One...

172
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,858
- Hot enough for you?
- It's not the heat, it's the humidity.

173
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,653
I had a feeling you were going to say that.

174
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,467
You know how long you've taken
on that one?

175
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,887
Check one print category.
Two. That's plenty.

176
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,602
I'm not going to give a guy a "No Record"
when he might have a record.

177
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,313
How long have you been with the BCI,
Serpico?

178
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,899
All my life.

179
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,361
That's long enough to know
how we do things.

180
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,948
Barto. It's not just that.

181
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,993
You don't like me.

182
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,704
BCI never had a weirdo cop before.

183
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:15,083
Barto. Stop bugging me.

184
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:28,180
(Conversation in Italian)

185
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:31,076
(Sings in Italian)

186
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:56,351
# Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-ba #

187
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,821
Hey. Wanna buy a puppy?

188
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,666
I don't know.

189
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,877
Where'd you get these dogs?

190
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,797
Oh, they're mine.

191
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,383
Want one for free?

192
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,971
Ah... no, I'll pay for it. How much are they?

193
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,806
$5.00.

194
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,975
You got it.

195
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,359
OK. Which one of you guys
wants to come with me?

196
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,694
- (Whimpers)
- What?

197
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,157
Come on.

198
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,368
- Will you do me a favour?
- What?

199
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,579
Watch the car and my stuff
as I'm moving in?

200
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,790
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

201
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:35,701
(Speaks Spanish)
Don Quixote: Actor or lunatic?

202
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,415
(Continues in Spanish)

203
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,550
Senorita Lane?

204
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,683
- Mr Serpico.
- I've got my horse here.

205
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,520
- Maybe I could drop you somewhere.
- I'm going to work at the Cafe Reggio.

206
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,731
Cafe Reggio. That... erm...

207
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,903
- That's Fourth Street and...
- McDougall and Third.

208
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,365
- That's it. Can I give you a lift?
- Sure.

209
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,285
Jesus, what's that?

210
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,746
You've got your hands on my money belt.
Don't do that.

211
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,165
That's not a money belt. That's a gun.

212
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,375
We've gotta eat, don't we?

213
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,089
- What do you need a gun for?
- Ever hear of Barnum and Bailey?

214
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,175
- Yeah.
- I'm their lion tamer.

215
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,927
- Come on.
- It's the truth.

216
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,554
- I think you're full of shit.
- You do, huh?

217
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,141
- What do you do?
- Oh, me? I'm an actress.

218
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,061
A singer, a dancer and a Buddhist.

219
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,271
In that order?

220
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:51,693
- I'm a cop. Would you believe that?
- No, I wouldn't believe it.

221
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,129
(Sings)

222
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,674
- Leslie. Leslie.
- Yep?

223
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,927
Those leaps that guy made.
What do you call them again?

224
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,429
- Jetes.
- Jetes?

225
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,852
You try it.

226
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,897
All right. How do you start it?
What's your position?

227
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,775
Comme ca.

228
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,239
Next life. Come on.

229
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,828
What are you reading now, Serpico?

230
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,458
My Life, by Isadora Duncan.

231
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,211
She was a ballet dancer.

232
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,338
A belly dancer?

233
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:58,844
No. A ballet dancer. Ballet.

234
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,263
You know ballet?

235
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,766
- A little.
- A little bit, huh? You ever see one?

236
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,935
Not close.

237
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,146
I've been to the ballet. It's terrific.

238
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,982
- I've been taking classes, you know.
- Oh, yeah?

239
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,192
Yeah. That's where I go after I leave here.

240
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,154
Fantastic for your body.
It really builds you up.

241
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,781
- I can tell.
- You noticed, huh?

242
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,868
- I noticed.
- There's five positions, you know that?

243
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:26,788
- Five? You're being short-changed.
- No, that's enough, believe me.

244
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,041
- For what?
- Watch.

245
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,919
See? This is the first position.

246
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,379
From this position, I can do anything.

247
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,757
- Want to see?
- Sure.

248
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,967
Here we go.

249
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,722
Bye!

250
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,935
- Lieutenant Steiger, I...
- No. Later.

251
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:57,861
- Hey, turn off the lights.
- Oh, Potts, I wanted to read.

252
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:04,034
Positions, positions. Positions like that
you don't see in a Pretzel factory.

253
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,495
How am I going to do my pee-pee
in the dark?

254
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,914
She's got to be a nympho
with positions like that.

255
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:13,460
Serpico, how can you piss
at a time like this?

256
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,545
Barto wants a specimen.

257
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,923
I'll look into this matter.

258
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,513
- What have you got there?
- Here.

259
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,723
Straight ahead.

260
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,103
- Straight ahead where?
- Third window down.

261
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,983
- I don't see anything.
- Let me see.

262
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,487
Oh, she just pulled down the shade.

263
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:44,908
- You've got to be some kind of jinx.
- That's right. Blame me.

264
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,871
Hold it, Serpico.
What were you two doing?

265
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:55,586
In the shithouse in the dark.
Were you going down on him?

266
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:03,135
- What are you talking about?
- You weren't doing a little peeping Tom.

267
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:07,139
- You were sucking his cock, weren't you?
- What are you, crazy?

268
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:12,227
I'll show you fuckin' crazy. Last week
I found a pair of shorts with semen on 'em.

269
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,646
There.

270
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,985
You're actually accusing me of this?

271
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,325
Good morning, Captain McClain.
I'm Officer Serpico.

272
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,577
I was told I could talk to you, sir.

273
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,832
Oh. Certainly, son. Come in.

274
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,422
Lieutenant Steiger won't make a report.

275
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,884
He's too concerned with the image
of his department.

276
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:47,429
But it... it could affect your future at the BCI.

277
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:55,729
Sir, I tell you... er... frankly,
I don't see any future there.

278
00:30:55,896 --> 00:31:00,108
It's all bullshit about it being a career path
toward being detective

279
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:04,238
- because I've been there two years now...
- And you want a transfer.

280
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:08,033
Yes, sir.
But I don't want to go back to Uniform.

281
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,661
I'll see what I can do, Frank.

282
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:16,583
Francis, do you know about
my weekend retreats for Catholic officers?

283
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,087
No.

284
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:23,799
You read that.
It might be of interest to you.

285
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:26,218
You are a Catholic, aren't you?

286
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:28,845
- Yeah. I was baptised.
- Good. Good.

287
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,726
Alfie, come on.

288
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:37,980
Paco! Ooh, missed you, baby!

289
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:44,444
- She's so crazy, that girl.
- Why "Paco"?

290
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:48,031
All my friends call me Paco.
Could you do me a favour?

291
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:51,493
- Get my keys out of this pocket for me.
- Sure.

292
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,038
Well erm... what'll I call you?

293
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,666
Frank or... Paco?

294
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:01,044
Paco.

295
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,923
(Swinging jazz)

296
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,390
- Leslie!
- Sally!

297
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:16,476
Oh, Larry! This is Paco.

298
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:20,772
Larry's a poet but he works
for an advertising agency.

299
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,067
And Sally's an actress
but she works for a photographer.

300
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:27,571
- Paco's a policeman.
- Oh... that's terrific.

301
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:31,408
- I work for the Police Department.
- That's really nice.

302
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:39,750
Pat's a novelist but you're working for
an insurance company now, aren't you?

303
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,627
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah.

304
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,463
- Paco's a policeman.
- Really? How exciting!

305
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,425
Not too. Right now I'm filing fingerprints.

306
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,969
I file insurance policies.

307
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:55,265
- We should get together and file...
- Hey, that was an improvement.

308
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,476
I want to ask you something.

309
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,979
How come all your friends
are on their way to being somebody else?

310
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,065
Think about that.

311
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:07,361
I want to ask you something else, too.
Will you do me a big favour?

312
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,571
Don't tell anybody I'm a cop.

313
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:13,242
- Let me just sorta do it myself.
- OK.

314
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:24,294
Hey, man, are you really a cop?

315
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,340
- That's right. I am.
- Wow.

316
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:32,511
- Leslie is a mind-fucker.
- You got to be kidding.

317
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:35,973
I didn't know that. What's a mind-fucker?

318
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:41,979
Well, it's a chick who digs intellectual types
and super bright guys.

319
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,733
She's very perceptive.

320
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:58,161
Japanese culture and theatre and painting
is too rigidly stylised.

321
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:01,707
You know. Yeah, but...

322
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,336
I think after a while
when you get through that

323
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:11,133
you start to appreciate
the clarity, the authority.

324
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,510
I got a sheepdog.

325
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:18,098
There have been sheepdogs in my family
dating back...

326
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,184
for sixteen generations.

327
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:25,480
Dating back to the Borgias.

328
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:32,404
The family crest is a sheepdog
pissing into a gondola.

329
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:45,000
Paco, everybody loves you! I love you!

330
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:00,724
Officer Serpico reporting, sir.

331
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:04,311
That fuckin' thing on your lip? It goes.
And get a haircut.

332
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,730
- Er... sir?
- That's an order.

333
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,815
You look like an asshole with dentures.

334
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:14,029
- Do I have the right of appeal, sir?
- Sure.

335
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:18,367
Go see Captain Tolkin. You got one foot
in shit already. Put the other one in.

336
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,619
Where might that be I wonder, sir?

337
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,914
Thank you, sir.

338
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:27,751
That is one hell of a moustache.
I wish I had the guts.

339
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:33,423
I have what I consider to be
good reasons for wearing it, sir.

340
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,926
- You don't have to tell me.
- I'd like to, sir.

341
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:38,136
I thought so.

342
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:43,600
I think it's time that we started
to communicate more on the streets.

343
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:46,687
The way it is, we're totally isolated, sir.

344
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,648
We're completely out of touch
with what's happening.

345
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:54,528
An undercover cop in disguise
wears blacks shoes and white socks.

346
00:35:54,695 --> 00:35:57,364
Everybody knows who he is.

347
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:02,286
You've made your point.
I want you to keep your moustache.

348
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:07,708
And I'd like you to patrol in your own car,
wear whatever you want.

349
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,794
- How does that strike you?
- I'd like that, sir.

350
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,839
- All right.
- To be honest, I'm bucking for detective.

351
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:17,092
- No shit.
- No.

352
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:28,895
(Alarm)

353
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,603
Hold it!

354
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,107
What the hell are you doing?

355
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:18,237
Oh, Christ.

356
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,573
Get against the wall.

357
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,202
Hey! I'm a police officer!

358
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:28,664
Get over there. Hey! It's me, Serpico!

359
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,710
Hey, I'm a police officer! Police officer!

360
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,839
- I'm a police officer!
- Jesus, Frank!

361
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,050
How was I supposed to recognise you?

362
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:43,971
- You stupid fuck.
- Frank, I didn't know you!

363
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:48,517
You didn't know me?
You fire without looking?

364
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:51,436
You fire without a warning,
without a fucking brain?

365
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,439
Oh, shit.

366
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,570
If I buy one, you motherfucker,
I'm not gonna buy it from you.

367
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:10,956
Holy shit, look at that mess.

368
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:18,171
- Filling out forms till next month.
- Good.

369
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:23,260
Jesus, Frank, I know this is
a helluva time to ask you...

370
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:26,471
but I'll have to go through
all that ballistics bullshit.

371
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:30,058
- Good. You should.
- It'll look bad with nothing to show for it.

372
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:33,145
Frank, do me a favour.

373
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:34,730
Give us the collar?

374
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:42,321
You motherfucker.

375
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:48,827
You want the collar?
You don't want to fill out forms?

376
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,176
Here.

377
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:08,555
- You're a buddy.
- Oh, I'm a buddy.

378
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:11,350
Only you tell Tolkin I gave it to you.

379
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:17,147
I am passing out these marijuana
cigarettes for you to sample,

380
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:20,192
so that when you become
plain clothes men,

381
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:23,445
you'll be able to identify the pungent aroma

382
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:27,282
and recognise the disorienting effect
of the drug

383
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:32,037
when you observe them
in narcotics suspects.

384
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:34,581
Among users of the drug,

385
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:39,753
a marijuana cigarette
is referred to as reefer,

386
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,757
stick, roach, joint.

387
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:48,595
The drug itself is referred to as pot,

388
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:53,725
tea, boo, stuff, grass.

389
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:57,896
Hey, this is real good shit.

390
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:01,275
- I gotta have something to eat.
- Oh, look what it is.

391
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:06,405
Look what it is. It's a potato factory
is what it is and I have to have some.

392
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:08,448
I love it, I love it.

393
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:12,536
We have nothing to...
I have to have a dime?

394
00:40:12,703 --> 00:40:17,666
- It goes in the little slot.
- That doesn't work. It's from the civil war.

395
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:21,169
- Pull on it.
- It doesn't, doesn't, doesn't, doesn't.

396
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:25,048
- Go ahead.
- It should shoot out. Please! I beg of you!

397
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:27,467
Come out, potatoes! Come out!

398
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:33,265
- You're pretty fuckin' weird, for a cop.
- Me?!

399
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:36,435
- What about you?
- You're the weird guy.

400
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:39,521
- You! You're a fuckin' hippy.
- It's beautiful, though.

401
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:41,106
The two of us.

402
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:44,902
Gimme.

403
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,364
Where are you supposed to go from here?

404
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:53,660
9-3 Precinct. Plain Clothes.
Put your gun away.

405
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:56,288
You?

406
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:59,207
I am scheduled to go...

407
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:02,878
on special assignment with
the Mayor's Department of Investigations

408
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:04,463
Detective Squad.

409
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,635
- That's gold shield.
- Yeah.

410
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,012
No four years in Plain Clothes?

411
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:18,268
- Who do you know?
- I make it my business to know people.

412
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:21,688
- People who can help.
- Unfair.

413
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:25,901
- Unfair.
- Life is unfair, man.

414
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:32,241
You've got a feel for the streets
and I've got a feel for the politics, I guess.

415
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:36,536
You and me in one Bat Mobile
could clean up the city in no time.

416
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:39,665
I wonder if we can get candy
out of this machine.

417
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:47,381
No, thanks.

418
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:54,888
Well, this is a good place to tell you, Paco.

419
00:41:57,182 --> 00:42:00,477
You know that guy in Texas
I was telling you about?

420
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:02,187
Yeah.

421
00:42:04,106 --> 00:42:07,276
- What about him?
- I'm going to marry him in two months.

422
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:10,112
Unless you marry me.

423
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:23,834
What about the theatre and the dancing?

424
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:27,129
A girl has to get married some time.

425
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:30,757
Well, you're a long way
from some time, Leslie.

426
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:34,553
I thought you were committed.

427
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,638
I am but...

428
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:42,060
You are but...?

429
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:45,814
I can go on working and studying there.

430
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:48,525
Where? Fort Worth?

431
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:51,236
Amarillo.

432
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:53,572
Amarillo?

433
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:02,998
Am I invited to the wedding?

434
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:08,253
I'll ask Roy.

435
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:16,219
It's pretty good in this precinct.
There you go.

436
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:21,141
Usually a nine-to-five day is the best time
for policy and bookmaking.

437
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:25,562
But if you have to work nights,
like liquor violations, just call in.

438
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:29,900
Don't worry about quotas right now.
A couple of hooker collar's will keep it cool.

439
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:44,081
Serpico. Been holding this for you.

440
00:43:44,248 --> 00:43:47,000
It's from Jewish Max.

441
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:45,434
First day on the Precinct I get that.

442
00:44:48,312 --> 00:44:50,355
This is great, Frank.

443
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:55,527
I can open a whole
can of peas with this.

444
00:44:55,694 --> 00:44:59,197
It's scary. I want to protect myself.

445
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:02,200
OK. You know what we do with this?

446
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,870
We take it to Inspector Kellogg.

447
00:45:05,037 --> 00:45:07,789
- Kellogg?
- Yeah.

448
00:45:11,001 --> 00:45:13,503
Kellogg? Didn't he used to be
in Plain Clothes?

449
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:18,216
He's the second highest-ranking cop
in the Department of Investigations.

450
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:22,554
I happened to be instrumental
in getting the man his job.

451
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:24,765
He owes me, you understand?

452
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:28,185
He's the most honest cop I know, Frank.

453
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:32,940
Frank... trust me.

454
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:49,456
Things like this were common practice
in the bad old days.

455
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:52,042
Hard to believe it's still going on.

456
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:58,840
Serpico, don't you think it's kinda stupid
taking an envelope

457
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:01,051
from somebody you didn't know?

458
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,554
Erm...

459
00:46:06,265 --> 00:46:11,270
What was I supposed to do? How would
I know what was in it unless I took it?

460
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:15,190
You er... you have two alternatives.

461
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:18,735
You can force me to take you
to the Commissioner of Investigations.

462
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:22,072
- He'll drag you in front of a grand jury.
- I don't want that.

463
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:25,951
I can understand that. Word will get out.

464
00:46:26,118 --> 00:46:30,497
Before it's all over, they'll find you
face-down in the East River.

465
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:39,548
- What's the other alternative?
- Forget it.

466
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,885
Well, what do I do with this?

467
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:07,326
- Hey, sarge?
- Yeah?

468
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:09,953
- Got a minute?
- Yeah.

469
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:14,416
A coloured cop gave me this.
I don't know what to do with it.

470
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:23,884
Yeah. I'll send it on
to the Benevolent Association.

471
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:33,435
(ltalian opera)

472
00:47:35,729 --> 00:47:37,064
Alfie.

473
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:01,630
Is that Bjorling?

474
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:09,638
No. It's Di Stefano.

475
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,434
I was sure it was Bjorling.

476
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:15,936
No.

477
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:24,236
You can hear it better over here.

478
00:48:24,403 --> 00:48:27,281
- That's an invitation, right?
- Right.

479
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:29,992
Coffee?

480
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:32,786
I'll have to take a rain check.
I'm due at the hospital.

481
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:37,874
Why don't you call in sick? Perfect place.

482
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:40,877
(Laughs) Not me.

483
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:43,213
Are you dedicated or something?

484
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,759
That's right. I'm dedicated.
Most men can't stand it.

485
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:51,346
- What do they know?
- I like your garden.

486
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:58,895
Hey. Love my garden.

487
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:02,941
OK. I love your garden.

488
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:09,239
- You know what they say, don't you?
- No. What do they say?

489
00:49:09,406 --> 00:49:13,410
If you love a man's garden,
you've gotta love the man.

490
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:21,501
You like her, Alfie?

491
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,214
All I can tell you is I gave it back.

492
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:28,717
I've got to get out of the 9-3.

493
00:49:28,884 --> 00:49:32,137
What happened
on your Narcotics application?

494
00:49:32,304 --> 00:49:35,682
It was all set until I told them
I was in Plain Clothes, and that was it.

495
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:39,895
It was like the kiss of death. They think
everybody in Clothes in on the take.

496
00:49:40,062 --> 00:49:43,607
Sir, do you know anything
about the Bronx 7th Division?

497
00:49:43,774 --> 00:49:47,694
I can go there if I want,
but if it's the same shit, screw it.

498
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:51,865
I'd rather answer phones for the Spanish
Communications Unit and go nuts.

499
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:53,867
Come on, Alfie.

500
00:49:55,035 --> 00:49:57,496
Frank, did anyone ever tell you

501
00:49:57,663 --> 00:50:00,749
that you have a tendency
towards self-pity?

502
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,462
- No, you're the first.
- All right.

503
00:50:05,629 --> 00:50:10,133
I have a friend up there. Roy Palmer.
He's an administrative officer.

504
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,428
- I'll speak with him.
- Good. Thank you, sir.

505
00:50:13,595 --> 00:50:17,015
- Bye, Francis. God bless you.
- Thank you.

506
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:23,647
(Phone rings)

507
00:50:24,773 --> 00:50:28,318
- Yeah?
- 'Frank? Captain McClain here.'

508
00:50:28,485 --> 00:50:31,488
- Captain McClain. Hold on a minute?
- 'Sure'.

509
00:50:38,996 --> 00:50:43,041
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Frank. I saw Inspector Palmer tonight.

510
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:46,712
He says the 7th Division
is as clean as a hound's tooth.

511
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:49,381
His words. "Clean as a hound's tooth."

512
00:50:49,548 --> 00:50:53,176
'I told him that he was getting
a hard-working officer.'

513
00:50:53,343 --> 00:50:57,389
Wears a beard, speaks Spanish.
He'd make a superb undercover man.

514
00:50:57,556 --> 00:51:00,475
- He was delighted.
- That's good news, sir.

515
00:51:00,642 --> 00:51:05,063
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- 'Good night, Frank. God bless.'

516
00:51:07,399 --> 00:51:09,943
When did you start doing that?

517
00:51:11,737 --> 00:51:16,450
McClain says that Palmer says
that the 7th is as clean as a hound's tooth.

518
00:51:16,617 --> 00:51:20,704
Well, if that's true, your problems are over.

519
00:51:25,918 --> 00:51:28,629
Plain Clothes Division?

520
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:31,673
Upstairs.

521
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:46,313
Frank! How are you? Good to see you!
We heard you were coming up here.

522
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,983
Say hello to Nate Smith. Frank Serpico.

523
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:53,654
- Jaime Morales, Frank Serpico.
- Serpico.

524
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,615
You'll love it up here. It's beautiful.

525
00:51:56,782 --> 00:52:00,786
I'll see you later. Take a ride with me.
I've got to make a collar.

526
00:52:00,953 --> 00:52:03,080
- Maybe I should check in.
- Fuck that. Come on.

527
00:52:04,331 --> 00:52:07,918
# Deck the hall with boughs of holly

528
00:52:08,085 --> 00:52:11,755
# Fa-la-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la #

529
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:15,801
...dollars if Minnesota. Right.

530
00:52:15,968 --> 00:52:18,345
Green Bay twelve and a half at...

531
00:52:18,512 --> 00:52:23,475
You dumb fuck. We told you this location's
hot. We told you to stay out of here.

532
00:52:23,642 --> 00:52:27,312
Keogh. Nobody told me. Honest.

533
00:52:27,479 --> 00:52:31,275
Bullshit.
Let's take a walk.

534
00:52:31,441 --> 00:52:35,821
- All right, a C-note a piece.
- No way. We got a complaint. Right?

535
00:52:35,988 --> 00:52:39,825
- Come on.
- All right, make it two hundred, Keogh.

536
00:52:39,992 --> 00:52:42,744
Are you getting cheap in your old age,
bambino?

537
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:45,289
- Three.
- Three?

538
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:49,418
- You heard me.
- All right. Three.

539
00:52:49,585 --> 00:52:51,628
I'll make it a light one.

540
00:52:53,422 --> 00:52:54,715
- Hey, Frankie.
- Yeah?

541
00:52:54,881 --> 00:52:58,176
- Want to write this up?
- No, I'm gonna check in.

542
00:52:58,343 --> 00:53:01,555
- Take the collar. Get on the sheet.
- I better check in.

543
00:53:01,722 --> 00:53:04,016
Hey, Frank.

544
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:05,934
We'll have a talk later, right?

545
00:53:10,814 --> 00:53:13,692
That dumb schmuck only came up
with two bills because I booked him.

546
00:53:16,737 --> 00:53:20,115
- Here you go, Frank.
- No, it was your collar. Keep it.

547
00:53:20,282 --> 00:53:23,994
I had a hunch you weren't going to take it.

548
00:53:24,161 --> 00:53:30,250
Frankie, we got a call about you
from downtown. I ain't saying who.

549
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:33,420
They just said you couldn't be trusted,
you know?

550
00:53:35,172 --> 00:53:37,758
- Cos I don't take money, right?
- Frank...

551
00:53:37,925 --> 00:53:40,344
Who can trust a cop
who don't take money?

552
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:43,472
You are pretty weird, you know, kid?

553
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:46,558
With that call and all,
the guys were getting a little worried.

554
00:53:46,725 --> 00:53:52,189
I told 'em you were OK. I knew you.
You'd never hurt another cop. Right?

555
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:55,484
You'd never hurt another cop, would you?

556
00:53:55,651 --> 00:53:59,905
- It'd depend on what he did.
- That's the wrong answer, Frank.

557
00:54:00,072 --> 00:54:01,406
Frankie...

558
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:04,743
(Kettle whistles)

559
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,454
We're not doing anything bad here.

560
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:13,293
We're skimming a little gambling money.
It's clean. It's not dope. Hurts nobody.

561
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:18,674
Frank, a gambler's a gentleman.
They'll operate anyhow, right?

562
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,970
Keogh, you don't have to explain
yourself to me. Do what you gotta do.

563
00:54:23,136 --> 00:54:27,516
- Want some tea?
- I don't like that shit. I'll have a coffee.

564
00:54:27,683 --> 00:54:31,144
What's the matter?
What are you worried about?

565
00:54:31,311 --> 00:54:35,566
Listen, we don't go overboard here.
We're not sloppy. We're careful.

566
00:54:35,732 --> 00:54:38,819
The spics, the niggers, we bust them
cos they operate so dumb

567
00:54:38,986 --> 00:54:41,238
they get your ass in hot water
every time.

568
00:54:41,405 --> 00:54:46,243
But the Italians are a different story.
They're men of their word. They're reliable.

569
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:51,498
- You've got it analysed.
- You're fucking right I have. It's worth it.

570
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:56,878
You know how much
the nut's running now, Frankie?

571
00:54:57,045 --> 00:55:00,924
- No, I wouldn't know that.
- $800 a month.

572
00:55:01,091 --> 00:55:06,471
That's 800 clams every time
your girlfriend gets the curse. Tax free.

573
00:55:06,638 --> 00:55:10,350
Here's the beauty. You don't get it
for the first eight weeks anyhow.

574
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:14,771
Till the guys get to know you
and you're OK. But you don't lose, either.

575
00:55:14,938 --> 00:55:17,399
You get it on the other end
when you leave the Division.

576
00:55:17,566 --> 00:55:21,612
Frankie, it's like... it's like severance pay.

577
00:55:22,946 --> 00:55:26,491
Think it over, all right? In or out.

578
00:55:30,746 --> 00:55:33,081
Look at me. I'm shaking.

579
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,420
All my life I've wanted to be a cop.

580
00:55:38,587 --> 00:55:41,006
I can remember nothing else.

581
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:46,428
I remember this one time...

582
00:55:46,595 --> 00:55:52,392
There was something happening.
A domestic argument or something.

583
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,395
Somebody stabbed somebody.

584
00:55:55,562 --> 00:56:01,151
And there was this crowd
around this tenement.

585
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:04,988
I must have been nine, ten years old.
I was this big.

586
00:56:05,155 --> 00:56:09,743
I went over to see what was going on.
The red light was going round and round.

587
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:13,163
There were all these people
and I couldn't see.

588
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:17,251
I kept saying,
"Do you know what's going on?"

589
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:24,091
Nobody knew. It was like a big mystery
behind that... that crowd there.

590
00:56:24,258 --> 00:56:26,677
All of a sudden...

591
00:56:26,843 --> 00:56:29,721
the crowd just parted.

592
00:56:29,888 --> 00:56:31,932
Like the Red Sea, you see.

593
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:37,104
And there were these guys in blue
and I said, "They know."

594
00:56:37,271 --> 00:56:42,025
But what do they know?
What do they know?

595
00:56:47,406 --> 00:56:51,076
It's amazing. It's incredible.

596
00:56:51,243 --> 00:56:54,621
But I feel like a criminal
cos I don't take money.

597
00:56:59,918 --> 00:57:03,380
- You get so tense when you talk about it.
- I wonder why.

598
00:57:03,547 --> 00:57:05,382
Come here.

599
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:12,431
- Right there.
- Here?

600
00:57:12,598 --> 00:57:16,101
- I'm going to ask you a question, OK?
- OK.

601
00:57:16,268 --> 00:57:20,480
- Do you like cops?
- You're my first.

602
00:57:20,647 --> 00:57:24,568
No, I mean all this shit
I've been telling you.

603
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,987
- Do you believe it?
- Why not?

604
00:57:29,114 --> 00:57:31,450
- Does it shock you?
- Not much.

605
00:57:31,617 --> 00:57:34,494
Aww. What's the matter with me?

606
00:57:34,661 --> 00:57:37,873
Everybody knows about cops.

607
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,834
Did you ever hear the story
of the wise king?

608
00:57:41,001 --> 00:57:44,129
No. But I get the feeling I'm going to.

609
00:57:44,296 --> 00:57:49,635
Well, there was this king
and he ruled over his kingdom.

610
00:57:49,801 --> 00:57:53,430
Right in the middle of the kingdom,
there was a well.

611
00:57:53,597 --> 00:57:55,557
That's where everybody drank.

612
00:57:55,724 --> 00:58:00,687
One night, this witch came along
and she poisoned the well.

613
00:58:00,854 --> 00:58:05,025
And the next day everybody drank from it
except the king.

614
00:58:05,192 --> 00:58:08,820
They all went crazy.
They got together in the street

615
00:58:08,987 --> 00:58:12,950
and said, "We've got to get rid
of the king, cos the king is mad."

616
00:58:13,116 --> 00:58:18,497
And then that night he went down
and he drank from the well.

617
00:58:18,664 --> 00:58:21,500
And the next day all the people rejoiced

618
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:24,836
because their king
had regained his reason.

619
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:33,136
- I think you're trying to tell me something.
- Me?

620
00:58:36,098 --> 00:58:39,560
Hey, Frank, I want you to say hello
to somebody.

621
00:58:39,726 --> 00:58:43,647
- Drop you cocks and grab your socks.
- What the fuck is this?

622
00:58:43,814 --> 00:58:46,483
Frank Serpico, say hello to Don Rubello.

623
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:48,694
He's your new partner.

624
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:53,198
Hey look, if you don't want to work
with this fucking nut for some reason,

625
00:58:53,365 --> 00:58:55,242
I'll buddy up with him, all right?

626
00:58:55,409 --> 00:59:00,956
And go through all that crap changing
assignments? Nah, we'll be OK.

627
00:59:01,123 --> 00:59:04,084
We're Paisanos, right?

628
00:59:06,169 --> 00:59:08,297
- What's with the fuckin' mouse?
- He's my partner.

629
00:59:08,463 --> 00:59:12,801
He's specially trained.
He goes to track down heroin.

630
00:59:12,968 --> 00:59:17,097
Let him loose, he goes into the hole,
picks it up, brings it back.

631
00:59:17,264 --> 00:59:19,725
Sniffs it out, brings it to you.

632
00:59:19,891 --> 00:59:22,269
Yeah, I've heard of that.

633
00:59:22,436 --> 00:59:25,439
You heard of that? Yeah.

634
00:59:26,899 --> 00:59:29,735
This guy I'm looking for. Vernon.

635
00:59:29,902 --> 00:59:34,573
He's a numbers collector
who ain't been meeting his obligations.

636
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:39,161
He won't be hard to spot. He's a mover.
This is prime time.

637
00:59:42,789 --> 00:59:45,250
Since we're partners,
you've gotta know the situation.

638
00:59:45,417 --> 00:59:49,796
Straight off. I collect for the Division.

639
00:59:49,963 --> 00:59:52,549
Me and two other bagmen.

640
00:59:52,716 --> 00:59:55,385
That's what Keogh was sort of hinting at.

641
00:59:57,596 --> 01:00:00,390
Yeah, three of us pick up
the payoff twice a month.

642
01:00:01,516 --> 01:00:03,560
Hey, look. There he is.

643
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,492
Son of a bitch!

644
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,791
- Look out!
- You stupid bastard!

645
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:42,075
Where's the money?

646
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:51,835
You've been jerking me around, you fuck.

647
01:01:52,002 --> 01:01:54,421
I'm behind now, man!

648
01:01:58,175 --> 01:02:00,260
Three times you never showed, right?

649
01:02:00,427 --> 01:02:05,057
I'll have it for you tonight. I swear.
I'll have it for you tonight. Don't bust me!

650
01:02:08,477 --> 01:02:11,104
Last time, Vernon. The last time!

651
01:02:11,271 --> 01:02:14,483
You fuck me and you're gone.
You hear? You hear?

652
01:02:16,777 --> 01:02:21,365
See you at the Domino. Midnight. You'd
better have $300, you fuck. You hear?

653
01:02:21,531 --> 01:02:23,992
Right? Right?

654
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:27,829
All right, Frank.

655
01:02:31,959 --> 01:02:35,921
Huh? Huh?
I keep this place for socialising.

656
01:02:36,088 --> 01:02:39,967
Some day we'll get a couple of broads,
huh? Have a little party.

657
01:02:42,886 --> 01:02:47,849
Hey! Mix some ice.
Booze is right over here.

658
01:02:52,938 --> 01:02:55,649
So what do you think, Frank?
About the money?

659
01:02:55,816 --> 01:03:02,656
Look, Don...
If I was broke, I had a family, I don't know.

660
01:03:02,823 --> 01:03:05,409
But I'm not broke and I don't have a family.

661
01:03:05,576 --> 01:03:07,744
Why the fuck stick my neck out,
you know what I mean?

662
01:03:07,911 --> 01:03:12,040
It's already out for not taking the money.
It's better the other guys don't know that.

663
01:03:12,207 --> 01:03:14,918
Hey. Tell you what I'll do.

664
01:03:15,085 --> 01:03:20,674
I'll hold your share for you. If you change
your mind, it'll be right in here.

665
01:03:20,841 --> 01:03:25,762
Right in here, right down to the penny.
Hey. Look at that.

666
01:03:25,929 --> 01:03:29,224
- What are you drinking?
- Scotch.

667
01:03:32,686 --> 01:03:35,606
Next thing I want to do
is get a colour TV for the games.

668
01:03:35,772 --> 01:03:38,442
How about some gin? Penny a point. Huh?

669
01:03:55,751 --> 01:03:58,128
Yeah, let me ask him first.

670
01:04:06,887 --> 01:04:09,139
Hello, Frank. Get in.

671
01:04:16,605 --> 01:04:18,482
My God, Frank. This is confidential.

672
01:04:18,649 --> 01:04:22,903
He's a police officer.
I thought maybe he could sit in.

673
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:24,905
No. Absolutely not.

674
01:04:25,072 --> 01:04:27,115
All right. All right.

675
01:04:27,282 --> 01:04:33,413
Frank, I notified Commissioner Delaney
about everything you told me.

676
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:37,376
He wants you to stay where you are
and continue to collect information.

677
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:40,170
Then you'll be his eyes and his ears.

678
01:04:40,337 --> 01:04:46,176
He said he was delighted that, quote,
"a man of integrity had surfaced." Unquote.

679
01:04:46,343 --> 01:04:49,888
When do I hear from him?

680
01:04:50,055 --> 01:04:53,141
He said he'd reach out for you
when the time comes.

681
01:04:55,686 --> 01:04:57,729
- Reach out?
- Mm-hm.

682
01:04:57,896 --> 01:05:03,110
My situation's pretty fucking sticky
up there. What am I supposed to do?

683
01:05:03,277 --> 01:05:05,320
You must have patience, Frank.

684
01:05:05,487 --> 01:05:08,699
- Yeah, but it's fucking sticky.
- Patience and faith.

685
01:05:08,865 --> 01:05:13,996
When the Commissioner says he'll get in
touch with you, he'll get in touch with you.

686
01:05:15,038 --> 01:05:17,291
Goodbye, son. God bless you.

687
01:05:32,472 --> 01:05:36,935
All right, now. Marinda's too hot.
We've got to lay off him for a few months.

688
01:05:37,102 --> 01:05:42,065
And Falco's got two runners he ain't
paying for. Check that fucking guy out.

689
01:05:42,232 --> 01:05:46,528
Hey, Frank. How are you?
Listen, Rubello's being transferred.

690
01:05:46,695 --> 01:05:50,449
- You'll have to work with a new bagman.
- Al Sarno, meet Frank Serpico.

691
01:05:50,616 --> 01:05:53,702
- This'll be your new man.
- All right?

692
01:05:53,869 --> 01:05:58,916
You know that operation down by
Hunt's Point? What will we do about that?

693
01:05:59,082 --> 01:06:04,046
You the new bagman? You prick! What
happened to Rubello, you son of a bitch?

694
01:06:04,212 --> 01:06:06,757
Wait a minute.

695
01:06:19,645 --> 01:06:24,483
You know, Frank, sometimes I ask myself,
"What the fuck am I doing?"

696
01:06:27,027 --> 01:06:31,156
If this ever came out... Christ, my family.

697
01:06:33,909 --> 01:06:38,372
My daughter. She just started
with the San Francisco Opera.

698
01:06:38,538 --> 01:06:41,541
Chorus. Took a lot of money.

699
01:06:44,586 --> 01:06:48,757
I once tried to pull out.
Christ, they were all over me.

700
01:06:48,924 --> 01:06:52,636
So you just go along.

701
01:06:56,848 --> 01:06:59,726
Unless you're willing to go back
to uniform duty.

702
01:07:17,619 --> 01:07:22,583
Shit, how the money rolls in.
Here, let me give you yours now.

703
01:07:22,749 --> 01:07:24,793
No. I'm not on.

704
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,631
- What do you mean you're not on?
- Just what I said. I don't take money.

705
01:07:29,798 --> 01:07:33,343
- Some gag here?
- No, I told you straight.

706
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:36,930
I don't take money. That's the truth.

707
01:07:37,097 --> 01:07:40,475
What were you doing with Rubello?

708
01:07:40,642 --> 01:07:42,895
(Frank) Ask Rubello.

709
01:07:45,689 --> 01:07:48,191
You're not... Where's it been going?

710
01:07:48,358 --> 01:07:50,777
Ask Rubello.

711
01:07:52,487 --> 01:07:56,241
- 'All right, sir. I'll go to Delaney myself.'
- That would not be advisable, Frank.

712
01:07:56,408 --> 01:08:00,037
You don't understand.
It's been weeks. Not a word.

713
01:08:00,203 --> 01:08:04,333
- 'I understand perfectly, Frank.'
- No, but Captain, they know I'm not on.

714
01:08:06,043 --> 01:08:08,962
I've done all I can do. Goodbye, Frank.

715
01:08:12,299 --> 01:08:15,469
He's out. Won't do another fucking thing.

716
01:08:15,636 --> 01:08:21,808
Nothing's gonna happen from the inside.
The top guys have been cops too long.

717
01:08:23,101 --> 01:08:26,188
You haven't heard from
Commissioner Delaney, have you?

718
01:08:26,355 --> 01:08:28,398
Not a fucking word.

719
01:08:35,155 --> 01:08:38,367
- Would you go outside the Department?
- Where could we go?

720
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:42,955
Would you believe the Mayor's office?

721
01:08:51,129 --> 01:08:53,548
- The Mayor's office?
- His right-hand man.

722
01:08:53,715 --> 01:08:56,134
A guy named Jerry Berman,
from Princeton.

723
01:08:56,301 --> 01:08:59,388
You knew I knew somebody.
That's the somebody I know.

724
01:08:59,555 --> 01:09:02,391
He cares, Frank. He really cares.

725
01:09:05,686 --> 01:09:09,273
Do you know what we're going?
We're going outside the Department.

726
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:11,483
That's right.

727
01:09:16,321 --> 01:09:21,201
Dynamite. Every plain clothes man
in the Division and one or two lieutenants?

728
01:09:21,368 --> 01:09:25,163
That is... that is dynamite.
That is incredible.

729
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:32,254
That is 150...
that is $250,000 a year.

730
01:09:32,421 --> 01:09:35,340
But that is just one precinct!

731
01:09:35,507 --> 01:09:38,093
That is amazing!

732
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:42,973
What I feel is needed here
is a real investigation.

733
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:45,934
I am sure that the Mayor
will see this immediately.

734
01:09:46,101 --> 01:09:50,397
McClain and Delaney.
They have done nothing.

735
01:09:50,564 --> 01:09:53,191
Man, that is amazing.

736
01:09:56,445 --> 01:09:59,615
And another thing, see...
In a couple of days,

737
01:09:59,781 --> 01:10:02,618
they're going to have a meeting at a pad...

738
01:10:02,784 --> 01:10:05,704
- Frank is in a very tough spot.
- I can see that. Rumours.

739
01:10:05,871 --> 01:10:09,958
I have heard rumours,
but never touching it directly.

740
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:15,422
For an on-the-line cop
to come forward like this is beautiful.

741
01:10:15,589 --> 01:10:19,343
Really, Frank, you have my respect.

742
01:10:19,509 --> 01:10:23,513
And my sympathy for what
you've been going through, man. Wow.

743
01:10:29,394 --> 01:10:31,605
Hello, this is Jerry Berman. Is he there?

744
01:10:31,772 --> 01:10:34,399
All right. I'll hold on.

745
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,834
Well?

746
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:58,507
- Tell me what happened, Paco.
- I'd like a drink.

747
01:11:04,263 --> 01:11:06,598
That guy's gonna go to the Mayor.

748
01:11:11,603 --> 01:11:13,855
To the Mayor!

749
01:11:16,191 --> 01:11:20,112
Come here, Alfie.
We're all gonna go to the Mayor together!

750
01:11:23,365 --> 01:11:26,285
I couldn't be any more embarrassed.

751
01:11:28,161 --> 01:11:30,914
It's like a personal defeat.

752
01:11:31,081 --> 01:11:33,875
However...

753
01:11:34,042 --> 01:11:38,338
- there are priorities.
- What are the priorities, Jerry?

754
01:11:38,505 --> 01:11:43,010
The priorities are
a long, hot summer ahead

755
01:11:43,176 --> 01:11:45,804
and riots are expected.

756
01:11:45,971 --> 01:11:50,767
And the Mayor cannot alienate
the police force.

757
01:11:50,934 --> 01:11:55,439
Now in the fall... now in the fall...

758
01:11:55,606 --> 01:11:59,443
it may be possible to take
another look at the situation.

759
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:00,777
All right. I'm sorry.

760
01:12:00,944 --> 01:12:02,279
Frank!

761
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:20,464
The whole of the rotten... chicken shit...
fuckin' system's corrupt.

762
01:12:23,342 --> 01:12:26,011
- (Knocking)
- Who's there?

763
01:12:26,178 --> 01:12:29,223
(Blair) It's me, Frank.
I've got to talk to you.

764
01:12:31,516 --> 01:12:34,603
Frank, you're behaving
like a goddamn child.

765
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:37,147
Let him in.

766
01:12:39,358 --> 01:12:41,401
You let him in.

767
01:12:50,369 --> 01:12:52,412
- Hi.
- Hello.

768
01:12:59,544 --> 01:13:02,923
Sorry, Frank. I'm sorry
I got you into the whole thing.

769
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:05,384
Bullshit. I got me into this whole thing.

770
01:13:07,177 --> 01:13:11,848
"Wow. Amazing. Dynamite. Beautiful."

771
01:13:12,015 --> 01:13:17,062
"Dynamite. Priorities. Priorities."
You and your big-deal friends.

772
01:13:17,229 --> 01:13:20,774
Your contacts. Your big bullshit names.

773
01:13:20,941 --> 01:13:23,652
Bob Blair, the big operator from Princeton.

774
01:13:23,819 --> 01:13:26,697
The mystery man with connections.
The hotline to the Mayor.

775
01:13:26,863 --> 01:13:29,116
Who the fuck do you think you are?

776
01:13:29,283 --> 01:13:34,079
You come looking for help, whining with
your humble pie act, the injured innocent.

777
01:13:34,246 --> 01:13:38,625
Who told you the Department or the world
was a fuckin' Boy Scout camp?

778
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:42,504
What did you expect, for Christ's sake,
a magician?

779
01:13:42,671 --> 01:13:45,132
Big Daddy?

780
01:13:45,299 --> 01:13:48,510
- A white knight who rides in on a horse...
- You just keep talking.

781
01:13:48,677 --> 01:13:52,806
- Keep talking cos that's what you do.
...the Pope's choir sings Ave Maria?

782
01:13:52,973 --> 01:13:56,268
You're gonna blame me
cos those bastards won't get involved?

783
01:13:56,435 --> 01:13:59,146
I tried to help you,
got my head handed to me.

784
01:13:59,313 --> 01:14:02,065
Where's your head?
It's on your shoulders.

785
01:14:02,232 --> 01:14:05,319
- You don't look so hot yourself.
- What's all this shit?

786
01:14:05,485 --> 01:14:07,571
Get ready to blow up.
I've got another idea.

787
01:14:07,738 --> 01:14:10,240
Your ideas are as full of shit as you are.

788
01:14:10,407 --> 01:14:14,536
We can talk to Foreman, Frank,
the Commissioner of Investigations.

789
01:14:14,703 --> 01:14:17,289
We've got another guy here.

790
01:14:17,456 --> 01:14:20,959
We could even talk to a guy I know
on the New York Times.

791
01:14:21,126 --> 01:14:24,129
That's terrific. Go to the Times.

792
01:14:24,296 --> 01:14:28,675
Every time I talk to you, Blair,
20 more people know about it.

793
01:14:28,842 --> 01:14:31,345
- It's safe.
- With my ass on the line, it's safe?

794
01:14:31,511 --> 01:14:35,057
- Your ass is already on the line.
- That's my business, all right?

795
01:14:35,224 --> 01:14:37,684
- You don't trust me?
- I don't trust you.

796
01:14:37,851 --> 01:14:39,937
- Go fuck yourself.
- Fuck you.

797
01:14:43,649 --> 01:14:45,609
When I come home,
I want the house clean.

798
01:14:45,776 --> 01:14:47,569
Don't take it out on me, Paco.

799
01:14:47,736 --> 01:14:50,280
I'm not! I don't want to pick up shit!

800
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:32,114
Honey?

801
01:15:32,281 --> 01:15:34,283
Come to bed.

802
01:16:35,928 --> 01:16:39,097
- Hello, Frank.
- Hey, Frank.

803
01:16:42,851 --> 01:16:45,062
We all know what this is about, right?

804
01:16:45,229 --> 01:16:49,191
So without any bullshit, what was
happening between you and Don Rubello?

805
01:16:49,358 --> 01:16:55,739
It's simple. I didn't take any money.
I don't take money.

806
01:16:55,906 --> 01:17:00,327
Rubello said if I changed my mind,
he'd hold my share.

807
01:17:00,494 --> 01:17:04,581
He'd give it back to me.
I didn't change my mind.

808
01:17:04,748 --> 01:17:06,208
Conniving bastard.

809
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:11,004
All right. Look, I'll handle Rubello.
I'll get back the money he took.

810
01:17:11,171 --> 01:17:15,634
But this ain't gonna happen again.
From now on, no more free bagmen.

811
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:19,471
Starting today, everyone of you fucks
makes his own collections.

812
01:17:19,638 --> 01:17:22,432
- No stops, no bread. OK?
- OK.

813
01:17:22,599 --> 01:17:24,434
- Right.
- You got it.

814
01:17:24,601 --> 01:17:27,646
What about you, Frank?
I'll make up what Don took from you.

815
01:17:27,813 --> 01:17:29,856
Why should I start now?

816
01:17:30,023 --> 01:17:33,318
Everybody would feel
a lot better about you, Frank.

817
01:17:33,485 --> 01:17:37,364
You can always give it to charity.

818
01:17:37,531 --> 01:17:39,700
$100 a month, just for expenses?

819
01:17:39,866 --> 01:17:44,329
For my secretary and
my business lunches, entertainment?

820
01:17:47,749 --> 01:17:49,960
All right. All right.

821
01:17:50,127 --> 01:17:53,422
We split Frank's share from now on.
You're a schmuck, Frank.

822
01:18:02,514 --> 01:18:06,018
If they would take all that energy,
put it into straight police work,

823
01:18:06,184 --> 01:18:09,897
we'd have the city cleaned up in a week.
There'd be no crime.

824
01:18:17,905 --> 01:18:20,282
If I could work alone. That's the thing, see.

825
01:18:20,449 --> 01:18:22,743
If I could just get to work alone.

826
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:25,621
They don't like that.
They want to suck you in.

827
01:18:25,787 --> 01:18:31,418
- You go over the same thing, Paco.
- It's so fuckin' corrupt. Everyone.

828
01:18:31,585 --> 01:18:35,839
There's gotta be a way to wipe it out,
goddamn it. There's gotta be a way.

829
01:18:36,006 --> 01:18:38,508
Let's get out of here. Let's go to a movie.

830
01:18:38,675 --> 01:18:42,262
Will you quit handling me? Go to a movie?
How am I gonna go to a movie?

831
01:18:42,429 --> 01:18:45,849
Do you know they'd kill me if they knew?
You think that doesn't happen?

832
01:18:46,016 --> 01:18:49,436
Either you're exploding
or you're lying around like a catatonic.

833
01:18:49,603 --> 01:18:52,773
- I can't stand it, Paco.
- You don't give a shit, right?

834
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:56,526
All I care about is you.
That's all that matters to me.

835
01:18:56,693 --> 01:19:00,239
That's why it hurts so much.
I can't stand to see you like this.

836
01:19:00,405 --> 01:19:03,784
Scared, miserable, dreading to go to work.

837
01:19:03,951 --> 01:19:09,414
It's tearing me apart. And then I get sick
of hearing about it and I hate myself.

838
01:19:09,581 --> 01:19:13,335
You don't like the idea of me being a cop,
so don't give me that shit.

839
01:19:13,502 --> 01:19:18,799
I love you, Paco. I want to marry you.
I want to have children with you.

840
01:19:18,966 --> 01:19:22,719
- Goddamn it! I hate it!
- Then why don't you get out?

841
01:19:22,886 --> 01:19:26,765
- Why don't you?
- It's crossed my mind.

842
01:19:26,932 --> 01:19:28,976
Well, do it.

843
01:19:29,142 --> 01:19:30,686
(Sobbing)

844
01:19:42,614 --> 01:19:45,826
- What have you got?
- Would you bust a whitey?

845
01:19:45,993 --> 01:19:48,620
Try me. Try me.

846
01:19:48,787 --> 01:19:53,083
This guy's heavy. He's Italian. Mobbed up.

847
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:56,044
Still interested?

848
01:19:56,211 --> 01:19:59,089
Stop fucking around.
I'm not in the mood. Come on.

849
01:19:59,256 --> 01:20:02,759
There's a loan shark.
Runs a big numbers operation.

850
01:20:02,926 --> 01:20:05,387
This mother's so cocksure,

851
01:20:05,554 --> 01:20:09,308
he picks up his own slips
while he's collecting his loans.

852
01:20:09,474 --> 01:20:11,101
Where's the drop?

853
01:20:58,565 --> 01:21:01,401
Hold it. I'm a police officer.

854
01:21:01,568 --> 01:21:04,154
And...

855
01:21:04,321 --> 01:21:06,907
Wait a minute.

856
01:21:07,074 --> 01:21:09,117
You're under arrest.

857
01:21:09,284 --> 01:21:11,995
Hell, I thought you were
some fuckin' junkie.

858
01:21:12,162 --> 01:21:14,706
I'll take that wad in your pocket.

859
01:21:15,707 --> 01:21:18,627
- You're a riot, kid.
- I know, I'm a joke. What're you doing?

860
01:21:18,794 --> 01:21:23,215
What's that? Put that away.
You're in more trouble. Give me your keys.

861
01:21:30,138 --> 01:21:33,600
- Where have they been hiding you, kid?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

862
01:21:36,728 --> 01:21:41,191
Hold this guy for booking. Get a rap
sheet on him. I'm gonna search his car.

863
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:08,051
- Where's Corsaro?
- Smith took him upstairs.

864
01:22:18,145 --> 01:22:21,231
I swear, I thought this guy
was some fucking junkie!

865
01:22:21,398 --> 01:22:23,233
(All laugh)

866
01:22:27,696 --> 01:22:29,740
(Serpico whistles)

867
01:22:36,371 --> 01:22:38,540
- Hey, you.
- Hey, who?

868
01:22:38,707 --> 01:22:42,794
You. Get over here
and empty your pockets.

869
01:22:42,961 --> 01:22:46,131
- I don't do that.
- You're my prisoner. You do what I say.

870
01:22:46,298 --> 01:22:48,675
He's gonna get nasty about it.

871
01:22:48,842 --> 01:22:50,886
You're fuckin' right!

872
01:22:51,053 --> 01:22:53,388
Frank, cool it, man!

873
01:22:53,555 --> 01:22:56,975
Lean, motherfucker! Spread!

874
01:22:57,142 --> 01:22:59,394
Frank, Rudy's on. He's good people.

875
01:22:59,561 --> 01:23:01,980
Stay the fuck out of this!

876
01:23:06,443 --> 01:23:08,612
What's this? What's this?

877
01:23:08,779 --> 01:23:10,489
Get in there.

878
01:23:59,871 --> 01:24:03,166
Serpico.
Got that record check on Corsaro.

879
01:24:18,181 --> 01:24:20,225
Want to read something?

880
01:24:22,352 --> 01:24:24,354
It's about your pal, Corsaro.

881
01:24:24,521 --> 01:24:27,274
Here, read it. Read it.

882
01:24:30,819 --> 01:24:32,779
He did 15 years. You know what for?

883
01:24:32,946 --> 01:24:36,158
For killing a cop. He's a fucking cop-killer.

884
01:24:47,169 --> 01:24:50,756
- It's good to see you again.
- That's it. I've had it.

885
01:24:50,923 --> 01:24:52,758
I can't take it any more. I've got to get out.

886
01:24:52,925 --> 01:24:55,135
If I have to go back to Uniform, I will.

887
01:24:55,302 --> 01:24:59,264
I can't wait for Delaney to call
and I can't play their game any more.

888
01:24:59,431 --> 01:25:01,475
The Commissioner didn't get it touch?

889
01:25:01,642 --> 01:25:05,187
Not a word. No investigation.
No undercover work.

890
01:25:05,354 --> 01:25:07,231
I had no idea.

891
01:25:07,397 --> 01:25:10,484
I think it's only fair to tell you
I've been to outside agencies.

892
01:25:10,651 --> 01:25:13,737
- I'll go to more if I have to.
- What outside agencies?

893
01:25:13,904 --> 01:25:18,533
Holy mother of God. Frank,
we wash our own laundry around here.

894
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,827
You could be brought up on charges.

895
01:25:20,994 --> 01:25:24,623
The reality is we do not wash
our own laundry. It just gets dirtier.

896
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:28,293
- You are in trouble.
- I don't care who gets it, including myself.

897
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:31,755
- If I have to go to outside agencies...
- Stay away from outside agencies!

898
01:25:31,922 --> 01:25:34,550
Where am I gonna go?

899
01:25:34,716 --> 01:25:38,053
- Wait till you hear from me!
- I've waited a year and a half.

900
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:41,723
That's not enough.
Where am I gonna go?

901
01:25:42,975 --> 01:25:45,227
It's my life, you fuck!

902
01:25:48,105 --> 01:25:51,608
Serpico, see Inspector Palmer.

903
01:25:59,449 --> 01:26:04,121
For this precinct, cases reported
- murder, 14 for August,

904
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:08,041
20 for September... Serpico!

905
01:26:09,918 --> 01:26:12,337
Inspector Palmer?

906
01:26:14,131 --> 01:26:18,927
Deputy Chief Inspector Daley and
Inspector Gilbert are waiting to see you.

907
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:24,892
Want to come to my office?

908
01:26:31,064 --> 01:26:33,108
Captain McClain called me.

909
01:26:33,275 --> 01:26:38,155
I've briefed Inspector Daley
and Inspector Gilbert on your allegations.

910
01:26:38,322 --> 01:26:41,617
The obvious question is this -
in all these months,

911
01:26:41,783 --> 01:26:44,244
why didn't you come to us?

912
01:26:45,329 --> 01:26:48,540
Well er...

913
01:26:48,707 --> 01:26:52,127
I never met these gentlemen
before, sir, and...

914
01:26:52,294 --> 01:26:56,506
er... you told... you... you...

915
01:26:56,673 --> 01:27:00,469
you told Captain McClain that the Division
was clean as a hound's tooth.

916
01:27:00,636 --> 01:27:06,225
You think you're the only honest cop
on the force, Serpico? My record's clear.

917
01:27:06,391 --> 01:27:08,393
Inspector Gilbert's just come from

918
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:11,772
the Commissioner's Confidential
Investigation Unit.

919
01:27:11,939 --> 01:27:14,566
Then you must have heard something.

920
01:27:17,194 --> 01:27:21,615
I don't understand. Commissioner Delaney
has known about this from the beginning.

921
01:27:23,575 --> 01:27:25,786
I didn't hear a thing.

922
01:27:25,953 --> 01:27:30,624
But I understand your frustration,
Frank, believe me.

923
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:36,255
It's sort of like trying to punch
your way out of a paper bag, right?

924
01:27:39,466 --> 01:27:43,554
What outside agencies
have you been to, Frank?

925
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:52,938
I don't see how that's pertinent
to my allegations.

926
01:27:53,105 --> 01:27:57,943
We ought to ask Serpico directly
if he's going to cooperate or not.

927
01:27:58,110 --> 01:28:02,406
We've got to know if there's
any real basis for an investigation.

928
01:28:05,325 --> 01:28:10,747
Well, I... I don't have to think that...
I have to think about that.

929
01:28:10,914 --> 01:28:13,792
What is there to think about?

930
01:28:13,959 --> 01:28:17,963
I don't see how the Division
can investigate itself.

931
01:28:19,172 --> 01:28:21,341
You've got a point there.

932
01:28:23,135 --> 01:28:26,889
But you would cooperate
with an impartial investigation, right?

933
01:28:29,766 --> 01:28:32,102
Yeah. Up to a point.

934
01:28:32,269 --> 01:28:34,563
As long as I'm not involved.

935
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:38,650
I just want to go someplace
where I can do my job.

936
01:28:38,817 --> 01:28:41,153
That's fair enough.

937
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:43,530
We'll be in touch.

938
01:28:48,619 --> 01:28:51,496
Inspector Palmer? May I see you?

939
01:28:57,753 --> 01:29:00,505
Was it necessary to let everyone
in the station house know

940
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,966
I was coming to see these guys?

941
01:29:03,133 --> 01:29:06,178
You believe from what you now know
that an investigation is warranted?

942
01:29:06,345 --> 01:29:10,557
- Yes, Commissioner Delaney.
- Go to it.

943
01:29:14,937 --> 01:29:19,650
But sir, shouldn't Headquarters
handle something like this?

944
01:29:19,816 --> 01:29:24,071
No. You're all experienced men.

945
01:29:26,156 --> 01:29:28,951
Chief Gallagher here will be available
for consultation.

946
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,459
Commissioner...

947
01:29:39,127 --> 01:29:41,672
Serpico claims that er...

948
01:29:41,838 --> 01:29:46,009
Inspector McClain talked to you
about this whole thing some time ago.

949
01:29:46,176 --> 01:29:49,846
Yes. I seem to remember
something about that.

950
01:29:54,685 --> 01:29:59,273
We can't set up a surveillance on
"somewhere over by Crotona Park".

951
01:29:59,439 --> 01:30:01,483
We need a location.

952
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:05,404
I've given you 36 locations
that are paying off. What do you want?

953
01:30:05,571 --> 01:30:07,698
The whole thing signed, sealed, delivered?

954
01:30:07,864 --> 01:30:10,867
You're conducting this investigation,
not me.

955
01:30:11,034 --> 01:30:12,995
Lieutenant Smith. Let's get back to him.

956
01:30:13,161 --> 01:30:16,623
Lieutenant Smith.
Lieutenant Smith said to me

957
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:21,295
if I didn't want the money,
he would stash it in his attack.

958
01:30:21,461 --> 01:30:23,463
I'll have him transferred in the morning.

959
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:26,341
Fuck him. How about transferring me?

960
01:30:35,475 --> 01:30:36,810
Serpico.

961
01:30:39,062 --> 01:30:43,901
I hear you've been vouchering pad money
over to a confidential investigation squad.

962
01:30:44,067 --> 01:30:45,777
Oh, yeah?

963
01:30:45,944 --> 01:30:48,739
How can I voucher money
when I don't take any?

964
01:30:48,906 --> 01:30:51,366
You won't find anything on Serpico.

965
01:30:54,286 --> 01:30:57,289
He's clean. Right?

966
01:31:00,667 --> 01:31:04,254
- Hm?
- You practising your frisk?

967
01:31:04,421 --> 01:31:08,634
No. I'm looking to buy
a used tape recorder.

968
01:31:12,387 --> 01:31:16,391
Wear a wire? They're feeling me up
every day. How can I wear a wire?

969
01:31:16,558 --> 01:31:17,851
Come on, Frank.

970
01:31:18,018 --> 01:31:22,147
Wearing a wire means testifying
to corroborate the tape, right?

971
01:31:22,314 --> 01:31:24,233
Right. I'm not testifying.

972
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:27,569
I've got to put a dime in the parking meter.

973
01:31:27,736 --> 01:31:31,114
Franklin, put a dime
in the parking meter for Serpico.

974
01:31:36,495 --> 01:31:40,582
Hey, Frank. Frank, you know
Herman Tauber, District Attorney.

975
01:31:40,749 --> 01:31:42,834
Yeah, I watch television.

976
01:31:43,001 --> 01:31:47,339
Frank, I want to compliment you
for coming forward like this.

977
01:31:47,506 --> 01:31:50,676
It's unique. It's uniquely unique.

978
01:31:50,842 --> 01:31:53,428
You should be proud of yourself.

979
01:31:53,595 --> 01:31:56,390
There's gonna be a grand jury
on these shit heels,

980
01:31:56,557 --> 01:31:59,643
with Frank Serpico as my star witness.

981
01:31:59,810 --> 01:32:04,982
Mr Tauber, you and everybody in this
room can go to hell, cos I'm not testifying.

982
01:32:05,148 --> 01:32:07,693
Wait, wait, wait. Just a second, Frank.

983
01:32:07,859 --> 01:32:10,529
You have nothing to fear.
You won't be singled out.

984
01:32:10,696 --> 01:32:14,616
You don't understand. I'm not afraid.
I don't give a fuck who knows.

985
01:32:14,783 --> 01:32:17,244
Do you mind if I say something, Frank?

986
01:32:17,411 --> 01:32:21,123
You're not going after corruption
in the Department, the Division, the Bronx.

987
01:32:21,290 --> 01:32:25,002
A few flunkey cops thrown to the wolves
to protect Delaney and those guys.

988
01:32:25,168 --> 01:32:28,672
They've known about this shit for years
and won't do a fuckin' thing about it.

989
01:33:03,498 --> 01:33:05,709
OK, what's this?

990
01:33:05,876 --> 01:33:08,045
Exactly what it says.

991
01:33:08,212 --> 01:33:10,923
I'm splitting.

992
01:33:11,089 --> 01:33:13,050
I've never read anything so stupid -

993
01:33:13,217 --> 01:33:16,303
"I'm leaving. If you want to discuss it,
I'll be at Felix's."

994
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:20,390
I didn't want another scene.
I figured you wouldn't be able to shout.

995
01:33:20,557 --> 01:33:22,726
I can shout anywhere!

996
01:33:27,147 --> 01:33:29,650
I won't shout.

997
01:33:29,816 --> 01:33:32,527
Sit down. Sit down.

998
01:33:45,707 --> 01:33:49,920
It's just going to go on and on.
It isn't going to get any better.

999
01:33:51,463 --> 01:33:54,591
And if you quit, somehow I'll be blamed.

1000
01:34:03,684 --> 01:34:08,730
How could you leave the man you love?
The future father of your kids?

1001
01:34:11,692 --> 01:34:14,903
You never said anything
like that to me before.

1002
01:34:15,070 --> 01:34:17,614
And if I come back...

1003
01:34:17,781 --> 01:34:19,825
you won't say it again.

1004
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:25,455
You want to be free and unattached.

1005
01:34:25,622 --> 01:34:29,543
To go on fighting for your cause
and keep torturing yourself.

1006
01:34:29,710 --> 01:34:32,462
My cause...

1007
01:34:32,629 --> 01:34:35,132
Paco...

1008
01:34:35,299 --> 01:34:37,426
I felt so safe with you.

1009
01:34:37,593 --> 01:34:40,012
So loving.

1010
01:34:49,855 --> 01:34:51,899
Stay with me, Laurie.

1011
01:34:55,319 --> 01:34:57,154
- Come on. Stay with me.
- No. No.

1012
01:35:08,749 --> 01:35:11,960
What do I... owe you for that?

1013
01:35:26,475 --> 01:35:27,809
Laurie!

1014
01:35:33,482 --> 01:35:35,651
What are you doing?

1015
01:35:39,363 --> 01:35:41,365
Do you want to walk away or should I?

1016
01:35:41,531 --> 01:35:44,618
I'm not gonna walk away.

1017
01:35:47,162 --> 01:35:49,206
It's finished!

1018
01:35:56,213 --> 01:35:59,508
Who do you think you are
pulling that no testifying bullshit on me?

1019
01:35:59,675 --> 01:36:02,886
Chief Green, I know your reputation.

1020
01:36:03,053 --> 01:36:07,766
Look, maybe if you were borough
commander when this thing started,

1021
01:36:07,933 --> 01:36:11,186
running this investigation,
I'd feel different about testifying.

1022
01:36:11,353 --> 01:36:13,730
But you're coming in after the fact.

1023
01:36:13,897 --> 01:36:17,985
You're like a quiff who says she won't,
then maybe she will, then she won't...

1024
01:36:18,151 --> 01:36:21,822
I'm like a quiff who's been fucked over
for a year and a half

1025
01:36:21,989 --> 01:36:24,700
by guys like Kellogg, McClain, Delaney...

1026
01:36:24,866 --> 01:36:27,953
I'm not Kellogg, McClain or Delaney.

1027
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:32,124
Frank, it won't be just flunkey cops.
This is only the beginning.

1028
01:36:32,291 --> 01:36:35,335
This could be the biggest thing
since the Harry Gross case.

1029
01:36:35,502 --> 01:36:39,006
Meanwhile I'm out there alone.
Who gives a fuck about that?

1030
01:36:39,172 --> 01:36:41,967
I'm totally isolated in the Department.
I don't have a friend.

1031
01:36:42,134 --> 01:36:45,888
Don't give me that bullshit.
I've been putting cops away for 30 years.

1032
01:36:46,054 --> 01:36:49,057
My name's an obscenity
in every precinct in the city.

1033
01:36:49,224 --> 01:36:51,894
- I've observed that, sir.
- "Friends."

1034
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:54,479
I fought my way up
as a Jew in the days

1035
01:36:54,646 --> 01:36:57,900
when you were supposed to have
an uncircumcised shamrock.

1036
01:36:58,066 --> 01:37:01,987
I have a nightmare. I'm on Fifth Avenue
watching the St Patrick's Day Parade,

1037
01:37:02,154 --> 01:37:06,074
I have a coronary and 9,000 cops
march happily over my body.

1038
01:37:06,241 --> 01:37:09,703
- I haven't got a friend on the Force either.
- I'll be your friend, Chief.

1039
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:12,956
I'm not looking for any.
I'll make an exception in your case.

1040
01:37:13,123 --> 01:37:17,294
Frank, you're a good cop. Stop being a
prima donna. Just cut out the schticklech.

1041
01:37:17,461 --> 01:37:21,131
How am I being a prima donna?
I want to protect myself.

1042
01:37:21,298 --> 01:37:27,304
Frank, if we're gonna get the indictments,
you're gonna have to testify.

1043
01:37:35,479 --> 01:37:37,856
Ready on the right. Ready on the left.

1044
01:37:38,023 --> 01:37:40,859
Ready on the firing line.

1045
01:37:41,026 --> 01:37:42,694
(Buzzer)

1046
01:38:30,617 --> 01:38:34,121
What are you going to tell
the grand jury, Frankie?

1047
01:38:36,081 --> 01:38:38,125
Depends on what they ask me.

1048
01:38:38,292 --> 01:38:40,961
Suppose they ask you
who's taking money.

1049
01:38:41,128 --> 01:38:44,673
- What I don't know I don't know.
- But you do know, Frank.

1050
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:49,094
Frankie, I like you.
I don't want to see anything happen to you.

1051
01:38:49,261 --> 01:38:52,931
But there are a lot of people
who could hurt you here.

1052
01:38:53,098 --> 01:38:56,894
I'm not saying it's going to happen,
I'm saying it could happen.

1053
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:00,230
There's lots of ways.
Nobody has to shoot you.

1054
01:39:00,397 --> 01:39:02,983
They can just not be there
when you need them.

1055
01:39:03,150 --> 01:39:06,445
If somebody comes at you with a gun,
they look the other way.

1056
01:39:06,612 --> 01:39:11,617
Or they'll send you in first enough times
till one day you'll walk in the wrong door.

1057
01:39:14,578 --> 01:39:18,373
- Thanks for the information.
- Fuck you, Frank.

1058
01:39:20,626 --> 01:39:23,420
I have nothing more.
Does anyone have any further questions?

1059
01:39:23,587 --> 01:39:26,465
Er... yes. If I may, Mr Knowles. Thank you.

1060
01:39:26,632 --> 01:39:31,011
Officer Serpico came to the 7th Division
more than a year and a half ago.

1061
01:39:31,178 --> 01:39:35,349
All during that time,
the things he's told us were taking place.

1062
01:39:35,515 --> 01:39:39,895
Why didn't Officer Serpico report
these criminal activities long before,

1063
01:39:40,062 --> 01:39:43,690
- when he first encountered them?
- I'd like to answer that.

1064
01:39:43,857 --> 01:39:49,571
Mrs Crist's question I don't believe is
material or relevant to the present inquiry.

1065
01:39:49,738 --> 01:39:51,865
I'd like to answer that question

1066
01:39:52,032 --> 01:39:55,827
Officer Serpico cannot be considered
derelict of his duty in any way

1067
01:39:55,994 --> 01:39:59,289
or guilty of any infraction of the law -
quite the contrary.

1068
01:39:59,456 --> 01:40:03,085
District Attorney is not prepared
to say any more at this time.

1069
01:40:03,252 --> 01:40:07,381
Very well, Mr Tauber. Officer Serpico,
thank you for your testimony.

1070
01:40:07,548 --> 01:40:11,593
This hearing is adjourned
until 10:00 tomorrow morning.

1071
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:14,846
Why didn't you tell him
about Delaney and Kellogg?

1072
01:40:15,013 --> 01:40:19,518
This was a grand jury about police
officers actively engaged in corruption.

1073
01:40:19,685 --> 01:40:23,021
You don't implicate people
without sufficient evidence.

1074
01:40:23,188 --> 01:40:25,232
That's crap and you know it.

1075
01:40:25,399 --> 01:40:29,194
Even a dumb cop like me knows
a prosecutor can take a grand jury

1076
01:40:29,361 --> 01:40:31,405
anywhere it wants to take it.

1077
01:40:31,572 --> 01:40:33,907
You never let me anywhere near
the real problems.

1078
01:40:34,074 --> 01:40:36,535
Nothing about the bosses, the brass,

1079
01:40:36,702 --> 01:40:40,330
how corruption like this could exist
without anybody knowing about it.

1080
01:40:40,497 --> 01:40:42,749
A few flunkey cops in the Bronx, that's it.

1081
01:40:42,916 --> 01:40:45,252
None of the shit
in Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan...

1082
01:40:45,419 --> 01:40:47,421
Don't forget Kansas City.

1083
01:40:47,588 --> 01:40:50,591
- "The biggest thing since Harry Gross"?
- All right!

1084
01:40:50,757 --> 01:40:55,929
Look, Frank. You've got guts. Integrity.

1085
01:40:56,096 --> 01:40:59,016
There's going to be
a detective's gold shield in this for you.

1086
01:41:01,685 --> 01:41:04,354
That's terrific. That's good.

1087
01:41:04,521 --> 01:41:08,775
Maybe this is what it's all about.
I should take my gold shield and forget it.

1088
01:41:08,942 --> 01:41:12,154
I know you've been through
an ordeal, Frank.

1089
01:41:13,822 --> 01:41:16,533
I'm a marked man in this Department,
for what?

1090
01:41:16,700 --> 01:41:19,578
- I've already arranged a transfer for you.
- To where? China?

1091
01:41:32,549 --> 01:41:36,970
That takes a 14-shot clip.
You expecting an army?

1092
01:41:37,137 --> 01:41:39,598
No, just a Division.

1093
01:41:41,683 --> 01:41:45,646
Tauber, did you know I've had reports
about Serpico being a fag?

1094
01:41:45,812 --> 01:41:48,982
He used to hang out in the BCI washroom.

1095
01:41:49,149 --> 01:41:52,152
That's stupid, Commissioner,
and you know it.

1096
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:58,033
Commissioner, a gold shield for Serpico at
this time would convince a lot of people...

1097
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:59,660
Not while I'm commissioner.

1098
01:42:18,804 --> 01:42:20,847
Commander's office?

1099
01:42:22,057 --> 01:42:24,309
It's down that corridor.

1100
01:42:27,396 --> 01:42:30,440
Hey, Serpico, do you know
what they're saying in the Bronx?

1101
01:42:30,607 --> 01:42:33,360
That you spilled your guts
to the grand jury.

1102
01:42:33,527 --> 01:42:36,321
Say it isn't so, Serpico.

1103
01:42:38,156 --> 01:42:40,200
It isn't so.

1104
01:42:40,367 --> 01:42:43,495
I know how to handle guys like you.

1105
01:42:43,662 --> 01:42:46,123
I oughta cut your tongue out.

1106
01:42:52,504 --> 01:42:54,131
Don't move.

1107
01:43:10,564 --> 01:43:12,608
(Knocking)

1108
01:43:16,194 --> 01:43:18,572
Officer Serpico reporting for duty, sir.

1109
01:43:26,788 --> 01:43:29,958
Inspector Lombardo.
I want to shake your hand, Frank.

1110
01:43:30,125 --> 01:43:33,754
It's gonna be nice to have
a guy here I can trust.

1111
01:43:33,921 --> 01:43:36,924
Anybody in this command
you want to work with?

1112
01:43:40,594 --> 01:43:45,432
It's not who I want to work with.
It's who wants to work with me.

1113
01:43:47,226 --> 01:43:50,270
If you can't find anybody
you want to work with, Frank,

1114
01:43:50,437 --> 01:43:52,731
I'll work with you.

1115
01:43:52,898 --> 01:43:54,942
Is that all right?

1116
01:44:04,326 --> 01:44:08,413
- How do we get past the lookouts?
- How many you got?

1117
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:10,916
One.

1118
01:44:12,292 --> 01:44:14,586
There's two.

1119
01:44:14,753 --> 01:44:17,089
There's three of them.

1120
01:44:17,256 --> 01:44:21,468
There's four buildings in one. We can
get down the fire escape, get in behind.

1121
01:44:21,635 --> 01:44:25,847
- Look good?
- Yeah, let's go.

1122
01:45:08,515 --> 01:45:12,352
- What do you think? Want to try it?
- Yeah.

1123
01:45:30,954 --> 01:45:33,624
- You all right?
- Yeah, I feel like a cop again.

1124
01:45:33,790 --> 01:45:35,292
Thank you.

1125
01:46:04,571 --> 01:46:06,615
Close up!

1126
01:46:08,951 --> 01:46:11,536
Frank, come on! Come on!

1127
01:46:28,679 --> 01:46:31,181
Get out of here. Get out. Go on.

1128
01:46:36,061 --> 01:46:37,938
What the hell's going on?
Who the hell are you?

1129
01:46:38,105 --> 01:46:40,148
The police.
Who the hell do you think we are?

1130
01:46:40,315 --> 01:46:42,359
Get the fuck against the wall. Up! Up! Up!

1131
01:46:42,526 --> 01:46:44,695
- Let me see your shield.
- You want to see a shield?

1132
01:46:44,861 --> 01:46:46,572
All right. There's my shield.

1133
01:46:46,738 --> 01:46:49,366
- Where are you from?
- The Borough. Manhattan 8.

1134
01:46:49,533 --> 01:46:52,536
You're not!
I just paid the Borough this morning.

1135
01:46:52,703 --> 01:46:56,790
- Hey, Frank.
- What the hell kind of shakedown is this?

1136
01:46:56,957 --> 01:46:59,001
Who did you pay in the Borough?

1137
01:47:00,586 --> 01:47:03,255
Nobody. I didn't pay nobody.

1138
01:47:03,422 --> 01:47:05,465
Who did you pay in the Borough?

1139
01:47:05,632 --> 01:47:08,510
I didn't pay nobody. Now let go of me.

1140
01:47:08,677 --> 01:47:10,721
We followed up and er...

1141
01:47:10,888 --> 01:47:14,141
there's no doubt about it.

1142
01:47:14,308 --> 01:47:16,727
The pad here in Manhattan

1143
01:47:16,894 --> 01:47:21,023
is bigger and more sophisticated
than the one in the Bronx.

1144
01:47:21,189 --> 01:47:23,859
The erm... the pick-ups here are made...

1145
01:47:24,026 --> 01:47:27,529
You want to get this?
The pick-ups are made by...

1146
01:47:28,989 --> 01:47:31,241
retired policemen.

1147
01:47:31,408 --> 01:47:35,329
That way no plain clothes men
are directly involved.

1148
01:47:35,495 --> 01:47:39,875
Now we need investigative help
on this one, Chief.

1149
01:47:40,042 --> 01:47:45,881
Well, Inspector, if you need investigative
help and you don't trust your own men,

1150
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:48,967
why don't you requisition some recruits
from the Police Academy?

1151
01:47:56,808 --> 01:47:58,852
With all due respect, sir...

1152
01:48:00,979 --> 01:48:04,900
backing us up is the only hope
that the Police Department has got.

1153
01:48:05,067 --> 01:48:09,279
A lot of good cops would come forward
if there was any encouragement

1154
01:48:09,446 --> 01:48:11,949
Otherwise they won't do it.

1155
01:48:12,115 --> 01:48:16,954
I've done a whole lot more than most
to defend the image of this Department

1156
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:20,958
and protect Commissioner Delaney
against reckless and irresponsible assault

1157
01:48:21,124 --> 01:48:23,210
from outside agencies.

1158
01:48:25,003 --> 01:48:29,299
That's it, huh?
That's what's really important, is it?

1159
01:48:29,466 --> 01:48:31,969
That's what you want to know.

1160
01:48:32,135 --> 01:48:34,888
What outside agencies I've been to, right?

1161
01:48:36,598 --> 01:48:38,350
- (Ringing tone)
- (Man) 'Hello? '

1162
01:48:38,517 --> 01:48:40,310
- Hello, prick.
- Who is this?

1163
01:48:40,477 --> 01:48:43,647
- Frank.
- Frank! How are you? Where are you?

1164
01:48:43,814 --> 01:48:45,482
Ready to go to the Times.

1165
01:48:45,649 --> 01:48:48,902
It's a goddamn serious step, Frank.

1166
01:48:50,445 --> 01:48:52,698
I don't know if the timing is right.

1167
01:48:55,993 --> 01:49:01,290
I want it to get on the record, that's all.
In case something should happen to me.

1168
01:49:04,835 --> 01:49:06,795
I want it on the record.

1169
01:49:10,090 --> 01:49:12,342
I don't know if we carry enough weight.

1170
01:49:12,509 --> 01:49:18,807
I don't know if the Times will go out on
a limb on the say-so of two flunkey cops.

1171
01:49:21,435 --> 01:49:24,438
Suppose an inspector
were to come with us.

1172
01:49:26,189 --> 01:49:28,317
You know, I got 20 years on the Force.

1173
01:49:28,483 --> 01:49:32,988
We just got this place and signed
a 500-year mortgage on it.

1174
01:49:33,155 --> 01:49:36,366
- (Television blares)
- Will you turn that thing off out there!

1175
01:49:36,533 --> 01:49:39,077
- Everybody to bed.
- Oh, Mom!

1176
01:49:39,244 --> 01:49:41,705
Come on, now. Go on upstairs.

1177
01:49:45,125 --> 01:49:48,003
This is against Department regulations.
You both know that.

1178
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:51,757
If they want to throw the book at me
they can do it.

1179
01:49:52,591 --> 01:49:54,635
If I left the Force...

1180
01:49:55,928 --> 01:49:57,971
I don't know what I could do.

1181
01:50:03,769 --> 01:50:06,897
OK, I've made my little speech.
I'll back you up 100 per cent.

1182
01:50:11,818 --> 01:50:14,154
Times. I got the money, fellas.

1183
01:50:14,321 --> 01:50:16,907
There you go. There you go.
There you go.

1184
01:50:17,074 --> 01:50:18,992
Newsweek, please.

1185
01:50:20,994 --> 01:50:23,372
Holy shit!

1186
01:50:25,290 --> 01:50:28,961
Oh, Christ. You can almost predict
the numbers they're going to do.

1187
01:50:29,127 --> 01:50:32,047
Delaney's going to issue
some phoney denial.

1188
01:50:32,214 --> 01:50:35,300
Somebody from the Mayor's office
will say something noble.

1189
01:50:35,467 --> 01:50:37,511
Delaney will change his tune.

1190
01:50:37,678 --> 01:50:39,680
The Mayor will appoint a commission.

1191
01:50:39,846 --> 01:50:43,642
"Thursday Mayor Lindsay announced
the formation of a five-man committee

1192
01:50:43,809 --> 01:50:47,437
"to review the City procedures
when investigating police corruption."

1193
01:50:47,604 --> 01:50:50,816
- How come I'm not in the first paragraph?
- Unbelievable!

1194
01:50:50,983 --> 01:50:53,735
Yihoo! Yihoo! Yihoo!

1195
01:50:53,902 --> 01:50:59,449
The Times report smells
of the familiar smear tactics

1196
01:50:59,616 --> 01:51:01,368
of McCarthyism.

1197
01:51:01,535 --> 01:51:05,914
I have issued a statement to be read
at every station...

1198
01:51:06,081 --> 01:51:08,667
The Mayor is appointing
a special investigation commission

1199
01:51:08,834 --> 01:51:11,837
- 'to be headed by Whitman Knapp.'
- Yeah, come.

1200
01:51:17,259 --> 01:51:21,221
Here's your reward, Frank.
It's a transfer to Narcotics, Brooklyn South.

1201
01:51:22,848 --> 01:51:26,226
Still in Clothes.
You get a tin shield, not a gold one.

1202
01:51:30,772 --> 01:51:32,774
I miss you already, Frank.

1203
01:51:37,779 --> 01:51:39,573
Look...

1204
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:41,700
Frank...

1205
01:51:43,660 --> 01:51:47,372
It's Narcotics. Be careful.

1206
01:51:48,999 --> 01:51:51,376
It's very easy to erm... get hurt.

1207
01:51:52,461 --> 01:51:55,047
You know, to er...

1208
01:51:57,090 --> 01:51:58,634
to be set up.

1209
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:40,592
Serpico!

1210
01:52:40,759 --> 01:52:42,719
Get in.

1211
01:52:59,611 --> 01:53:02,781
You're not wired, are you?

1212
01:53:02,948 --> 01:53:05,409
OK, you cocksucker.

1213
01:53:05,576 --> 01:53:08,829
You might get by in the Bronx
with that kind of shit,

1214
01:53:08,996 --> 01:53:12,749
but down here
800 a month is chicken feed.

1215
01:53:14,418 --> 01:53:19,381
Last week one dope dealer sent out
these guys making pick-ups.

1216
01:53:19,548 --> 01:53:21,800
40,000 each.

1217
01:53:21,967 --> 01:53:26,221
We let 'em collect it all and then hit 'em.

1218
01:53:26,388 --> 01:53:29,850
120,000 split four ways.

1219
01:53:30,017 --> 01:53:32,603
That's serious money.

1220
01:53:32,769 --> 01:53:36,732
And with that, you don't fuck around.

1221
01:53:36,899 --> 01:53:39,943
I got the message.

1222
01:53:40,110 --> 01:53:43,405
Good. Now get the fuck out.

1223
01:53:50,162 --> 01:53:53,999
The guy's name is Limbo. He always uses
his girlfriend's brother's place.

1224
01:53:54,166 --> 01:53:56,126
He's a pusher. Heroin.

1225
01:53:56,293 --> 01:54:00,714
We're going to drive round to the corner.
You keep in sight, out front.

1226
01:54:00,881 --> 01:54:04,343
When you spot somebody who's dirty,
you take off your glasses and wipe 'em.

1227
01:54:04,509 --> 01:54:06,261
Right. OK.

1228
01:55:15,914 --> 01:55:18,292
If we stay around here we'll get spotted.

1229
01:55:18,458 --> 01:55:21,837
Well, Frank, why don't you go up there
and check it out?

1230
01:55:22,004 --> 01:55:25,215
- Why don't you?
- I got the wrong clothes.

1231
01:55:25,382 --> 01:55:28,010
- I'll take you shopping.
- Uh-huh.

1232
01:57:11,738 --> 01:57:13,782
- (Knocking)
- Limbo?

1233
01:57:15,492 --> 01:57:18,412
(Speaks Spanish)

1234
01:57:47,482 --> 01:57:49,526
Police! Freeze!

1235
01:57:49,693 --> 01:57:52,571
Police Officer. Up against the wall.
Get your hands up.

1236
01:57:54,656 --> 01:57:57,200
All right. Palms up on the wall
and spread 'em.

1237
01:57:57,367 --> 01:58:00,787
Get 'em up! Get your hands up!
Come on! Get your feet apart!

1238
01:58:00,954 --> 01:58:03,582
- I saw the buy.
- All right, let's get Limbo.

1239
01:58:03,749 --> 01:58:05,626
- Julio, you all right, baby?
- Yeah, I got 'em.

1240
01:59:10,357 --> 01:59:12,150
Police officer!

1241
01:59:21,618 --> 01:59:23,453
What the fuck are you waiting for?

1242
01:59:24,413 --> 01:59:26,373
(Limbo) Get out! Go down the fire escape!

1243
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:46,101
Police! Drop your guns
and come out with your hands up!

1244
02:00:21,637 --> 02:00:24,681
- What have we got here?
- It's Mr and Mrs Serpico.

1245
02:00:24,848 --> 02:00:26,642
OK. Go ahead.

1246
02:00:30,062 --> 02:00:32,773
- Yes?
- Where's our son?

1247
02:00:32,940 --> 02:00:35,984
- They're bringing him down from X-Ray.
- We want to see him.

1248
02:00:36,151 --> 02:00:38,195
Just a few minutes.

1249
02:01:05,514 --> 02:01:10,227
Mr and Mrs Serpico,
the news is better than we expected.

1250
02:01:10,394 --> 02:01:14,856
Thank God the bullet was a small calibre.

1251
02:01:15,023 --> 02:01:17,568
It didn't enter the brain.

1252
02:01:17,734 --> 02:01:21,989
- (Translates)
- Or strike the spinal chord.

1253
02:01:22,155 --> 02:01:25,534
He's on the critical list.

1254
02:01:25,701 --> 02:01:28,370
But his condition seems to be stable.

1255
02:01:28,537 --> 02:01:31,832
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

1256
02:02:05,991 --> 02:02:08,869
Stay out of there. Didn't they tell you?

1257
02:02:09,036 --> 02:02:12,164
- What?
- The word is don't talk to him.

1258
02:02:12,331 --> 02:02:14,374
He's no fuckin' good.

1259
02:02:23,675 --> 02:02:25,886
- How you doin', kid?
- Hello, Sid.

1260
02:02:33,060 --> 02:02:34,895
Come over here.

1261
02:02:38,315 --> 02:02:40,692
Want to read my fan mail?

1262
02:02:40,859 --> 02:02:44,529
Sure. You're a big shot now, huh?

1263
02:03:09,179 --> 02:03:11,265
Sid...

1264
02:03:13,225 --> 02:03:16,853
I want you to get those fucking cops
away from my door.

1265
02:03:27,406 --> 02:03:30,868
The Knapp Commission likes you.
They want you to appear.

1266
02:03:31,034 --> 02:03:32,703
Naturally.

1267
02:03:36,582 --> 02:03:41,253
Heinemann and Julio are cleared.
You're up for exceptional merit awards.

1268
02:03:41,420 --> 02:03:44,172
That's very funny.

1269
02:03:50,345 --> 02:03:52,848
That's very funny.

1270
02:03:53,015 --> 02:03:55,517
Francisco, you love me?

1271
02:03:56,727 --> 02:04:00,272
I always had a thing for you, Sid,
you know that.

1272
02:04:04,526 --> 02:04:06,778
Your gold shield's come through.

1273
02:04:35,432 --> 02:04:37,517
What's this for?

1274
02:04:40,771 --> 02:04:43,523
For being an honest cop?

1275
02:04:43,690 --> 02:04:44,983
Hm?

1276
02:04:45,150 --> 02:04:49,071
Or for being stupid enough
to get shot in the face?

1277
02:04:53,617 --> 02:04:56,828
You tell 'em they can shove it.

1278
02:05:02,251 --> 02:05:04,461
I don't want it.

1279
02:05:42,791 --> 02:05:44,960
Oh, well.

1280
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:52,342
Well, Frank, the facts are these.

1281
02:05:52,509 --> 02:05:56,013
You'll have to stay on leave of absence
for a few months.

1282
02:05:56,179 --> 02:05:59,433
In all probability, the hearing in your left ear
won't come back.

1283
02:05:59,600 --> 02:06:03,103
Two bullet fragments are still lodged there
in the bony portion.

1284
02:06:03,270 --> 02:06:07,274
One is very close to the carotid artery
and you'll have to have checks.

1285
02:06:07,441 --> 02:06:09,651
Your left side will feel stiff occasionally.

1286
02:06:09,818 --> 02:06:13,864
Once in a great while you may experience
some dizziness.

1287
02:06:14,031 --> 02:06:16,241
But in general, you'll be OK.

1288
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:36,762
Through my appearance here today,

1289
02:06:36,929 --> 02:06:38,972
I hope that police officers in the future

1290
02:06:39,139 --> 02:06:43,894
will not experience the same frustration
and anxiety that I was subjected to

1291
02:06:44,061 --> 02:06:47,147
for the past five years
at the hands of my superiors

1292
02:06:47,314 --> 02:06:50,317
because of my attempt
to report corruption.

1293
02:06:50,484 --> 02:06:54,613
I was made to feel that I had burdened
them with an unwanted task.

1294
02:06:54,780 --> 02:06:58,242
The problem is that the atmosphere
does not yet exist

1295
02:06:58,408 --> 02:07:02,955
in which an honest police officer can act
without fear of ridicule or reprisal

1296
02:07:03,121 --> 02:07:04,957
from fellow officers.

1297
02:07:05,123 --> 02:07:09,002
Police corruption cannot exist
unless it is at least tolerated

1298
02:07:09,169 --> 02:07:11,088
at higher levels in the Department.

1299
02:07:11,255 --> 02:07:15,050
Therefore the most important result
that can come from these hearings

1300
02:07:15,217 --> 02:07:18,804
is a conviction by police officers
that the Department will change.

1301
02:07:18,971 --> 02:07:23,892
In order to ensure this, an independent,
permanent investigative body

1302
02:07:24,059 --> 02:07:27,813
dealing with police corruption
like this commission, is essential.

1303
02:07:27,980 --> 02:07:30,023
(Applause)
