Did you do any housekeeping the

No. Because our guys

they mop up the blood...

suggests kidnapping.

Mr. Bolt.
Tanner Bolt?

1568
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,359
Nick Dunne.

1569
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,820
I have been
sitting by the phone,
my friend.

1570
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:23,569
(LAUGHING)

1571
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:25,404
I'm sorry.

1572
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:27,289
Do you not believe me?

1573
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:30,577
No, I believe you.
It's just the craziest
thing I've ever heard.

1574
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:34,088
I love it.
But, for you, it sucks.

1575
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:36,348
But you gotta have
a grudging respect...

1576
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:37,962
for your wife at
this point, right?

1577
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:39,593
Are you laughing me out
of the building? No!

1578
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:41,379
Are you kidding me?
I'm in.

1579
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:42,888
I'm way in.

1580
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,550
You came to the right guy.
This is what I do, Nick.

1581
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:49,016
This is why I have
a $100,000 retainer.
I win the unwinnable cases.

1582
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:50,725
$100,000?

1583
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:52,310
We'll figure something out.

1584
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:53,471
I'll give you a special...

1585
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:56,314
"my wife is skilled in the
art of vengeance" rate.

1586
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:57,478
Okay-

1587
01:20:57,561 --> 01:20:59,063
So, what's the plan?

1588
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:00,981
Well, right now,
it's a "he said, she said."

1589
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:02,149
She's telling a better story.

1590
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:03,484
No, Nick.

1591
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,493
She is telling
the perfect story.

1592
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:08,952
So, we need to start today
to prepare your defense,
should we need it.

1593
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:10,366
And if we decide to go
with your version of...

1594
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:11,496
The truth.

1595
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:15,583
Then we'll need to realign
the public's
perception of Amy.

1596
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:17,916
Make them stop seeing her
as America's sweetheart...

1597
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:19,299
and see her
for what she is...

1598
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,423
which a mind-fucker
of the first degree.

1599
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,712
Now, that is
a huge realignment.

1600
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,673
We'll need other
voices besides yours.

1601
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:26,886
There has to be
someone out there...

1602
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:27,966
that she's screwed
with in the past.

1603
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:29,555
There's a New York guy.

1604
01:21:29,635 --> 01:21:31,103
O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.

1605
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,261
Eight years ago...

1606
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:33,544
she pressed
charges against him.

1607
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,853
That should be
easy to find.

1608
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:39,646
Um, ex-classmate,
Desi Collings.

1609
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,692
She said that he stalked her.
He's in St. Louis.

1610
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:45,234
You go talk to Tommy,
and I'll draw up the contract.

1611
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:52,534
I told you,
you came to the right guy.

1612
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:55,960
Apparently.

1613
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,676
Tommy?

1614
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:08,386
Yeah.

1615
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:10,767
Thanks for seeing me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1616
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:15,560
Urn, you're gonna
want a drink.

1617
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:17,315
Yeah.

1618
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:20,148
NICK: <i>So, she said you
got physical with her.</i>

1619
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:23,154
No, dude,
she said I raped her.

1620
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:25,691
First degree, felony rape.

1621
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,115
Did you do it?
Did you do it?

1622
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:29,240
Yeah.

1623
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:31,413
I was looking at
30 years to life.

1624
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,369
Did you get a trial?
Fuck, no.

1625
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:35,626
Do I look like I would
do well in the yard?

1626
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:38,708
I pled down, man.
Sexual assault one,
no jail time.

1627
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:40,668
That's something.
Oh, yeah.

1628
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:42,128
I've been unemployed
for the last eight years...

1629
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,669
because I have to
write "sexual offender"
on every job application.

1630
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:46,195
I'm on
a neighborhood watch list...

1631
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:47,672
because I have to
register as a predator.

1632
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:49,478
I haven't had a date
in almost a decade...

1633
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:51,179
because if
a girl googles me...

1634
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:53,051
(SIGHS)

1635
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:55,058
Could you walk me
through what happened?

1636
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:58,349
I meet Amy at
this party, you know?

1637
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:00,017
We click. She's perfect.

1638
01:23:00,184 --> 01:23:02,403
She's beautiful,
she's smart,
she's well-read...

1639
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:04,734
she's got an ass
like a 20-year-old stripper.

1640
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:06,570
I think,
"What's the catch?"

1641
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,906
A few months, it hits me.
This is not going to be easy.

1642
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:13,493
Girls like a fixer-upper,
but Amy?

1643
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:17,000
She annexed me.
She made me her business.

1644
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:20,834
It was just too much. She
went out and bought me ties.

1645
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,090
And we must have gone
20 rounds over that.

1646
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:25,876
Ties. The whole thing
just became...

1647
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:27,340
So, you broke up with her.

1648
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,717
No, I just backed away.

1649
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,554
Gave her some space.
No big deal, right?

1650
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,263
So I thought.

1651
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:36,599
Then one night, Amy comes
over to my place...

1652
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:39,561
with a bottle of bourbon
and a bootleg of
this band I love.

1653
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:42,602
And within two minutes,
she's got my pants
around my ankles...

1654
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,236
and she is
kneeling down, and...

1655
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:46,271
I'm sorry.
I know it's your wife.

1656
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:48,190
You had sex?
Yeah, consensual.

1657
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,451
It was rough, but she
was screaming for it.

1658
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:53,245
Next morning, there's
two cops at my door.

1659
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:56,369
Amy has wounds that
are consistent with rape.

1660
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:59,581
Ligature marks on her
wrist, and my semen.

1661
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:03,293
It looks like I've tied Amy
to my bed, and raped her.

1662
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:04,798
Me!

1663
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,584
And then,
guess what they find.

1664
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,798
Headboards of my bed,
one on each side.

1665
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,428
The ties you wouldn't wear.

1666
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:11,930
You do know your wife.

1667
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:14,307
Did you ever see her again?
Yeah.

1668
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:15,888
On TV, last week,
with you.

1669
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:17,765
I thought, "There's Amy.

1670
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:21,933
"She's graduated from being
raped to being murdered."

1671
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:24,476
Mmm!

1672
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:26,849
You been watching this,
too?

1673
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,139
<i>ELLEN:
Last night's bombshell.</i>

1674
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:29,231
We just found out...

1675
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:32,158
<i>Amy Elliott Dunne was, indeed,
pregnant when she went missing.</i>

1676
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:35,495
<i>Kelly Capitono,
this makes me wanna throw up.</i>

1677
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:37,054
<i>What is it about
a pregnant woman...</i>

1678
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,494
a <i>woman carrying
life inside her...</i>

1679
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:40,000
<i>that turns men into animals?</i>

1680
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:41,660
KELLY: <i>Ellen,
this is an epidemic.</i>

1681
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:44,152
<i>The third leading cause of
death among pregnant women...</i>

1682
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,499
<i>is homicide committed by
a boyfriend or husband.</i>

1683
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:49,418
<i>Let's not forget
about the wife, ever.</i>

1684

<i>Tonight, we welcome Amy's best
friend, Noelle Hawthorne.</i>

01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:55,925
<i>Thanks for being
on the show, Noelle.</i>

1686
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:57,263
<i>Thank you, Ellen.</i>

1687
01:24:57,426 --> 01:24:58,803
<i>And let me just say this...</i>

1688
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:02,439
<i>Amy would have loved you,
and all you do for women.</i>

1689
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:03,598
<i>Oh, that's nice.</i>

1690
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:05,684
<i>Why don't you tell us about your
friend, Noelle?

1691
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:08,274
<i>Amy was so nurturing.</i>

1692
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:10,690
Oh, I'd love if just once,
someone was like...

1693
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:12,153
"She was a real rag."

1694
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,572
(LAUGHING)

1695
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:17,120
<i>She was beautiful
and smart and kind.</i>

1696
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:19,202
Seems like a rich
bitch to me.

1697
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:21,867
What do you mean?
People love her.

1698
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:24,457
GRETA: I don't know.
She seems uppity.

1699
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:28,541
Spoiled rich girl,
married a cheating asshole.

1700
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:29,799
Paid the ultimate price.

1701
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:32,211
NOELLE: <i>The only secret
was her husband.</i>

1702
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:33,295
<i>We never met Nick.</i>

1703
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:34,964
<i>He never introduced himself.</i>

1704
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,383
ELLEN: <i>Why was that, Noelle?
Why do you think?</i>

1705
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:38,550
<i>I think we know why.</i>

1706
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:41,471
<i>Because he had
a violent temper.</i>

1707
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:42,638
A little harsh.

1708
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:44,189
That's life, baby.

1709
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:45,908
<i>He knew I'd have
seen right through him.</i>

1710
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,067
Don't get me wrong.

1711
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:49,978
I'm not saying it's
okay he killed her.

1712
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:53,570
I'm just saying,
there are consequences.

1713
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:56,692
Fuck, yeah.

1714
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:59,033
<i>She was so alone.</i>

1715
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:00,994
<i>And she was so innocent.</i>

1716
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:04,501
<i>You're a good friend, Noelle. And
you're a good friend of the show.</i>

1717
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:05,752
Thanks for coming on.
(PHONE RINGING)

1718

your father's house.

01:57:27,958 --> 01:57:29,198
Is this your
wife's handwriting?

Looks like it.

She wanted to get pregnant,
you assaulted her.

2344
01:57:55,318 --> 01:57:57,195
I hit her?
No, never happened.

She tried to buy a gun.
