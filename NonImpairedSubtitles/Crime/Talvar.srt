1
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,602
Sir, this is Vikas Shankar

2
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,147
Mr. Ramesh Tyagi

3
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,111
M r.\/edant Chaudhry

4
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,778
Mr. Agnivesh Katariya

5
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,349
Mr. Junaid Ahmed

6
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,648
And Mr. Ashvvin Kumar

7
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,157
Nandhari Killings?

8
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,289
Sir Telgi scam.

9
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,262
Well done Mr. Kumar!

10
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,026
We are proud of you

11
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:35,756
Thank you Sir

12
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:49,240
Sir you know, I have seen the files.

13
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,140
I understand... I'll talk to him.

14
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,449
But where is he?

15
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,511
There he is!

16
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,584
Sir...
- I told you...

17
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,451
...he'd be hiding somewhere...

18
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,015
...and playing his game.

19
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,058
The Minister wanted to meet you...

20
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,755
...but you were nowhere to be found.

21
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,689
Sir, I'd told Mr. Pillai about

22
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,291
my reservation in taking that case.

23
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,165
And I told Mr Secretary that,

24
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,135
Didn't I tell you...

25
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,502
...ordinary murder cases are

26
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,132
way below Ashwin's standards.

27
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,610
Look Ashwin... It's not an
ordinary murder case any more

28
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,579
The entire middle class
society is shaken up.

29
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,251
L-low can a father
murder his own daughter'?

30
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:28,652
I know...

31
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,113
And even if it's true,
as the police say,

32
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,283
...till the CDI does not verify it...

33
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,491
The issue will remain stuck
like a fishbone in our throat.

34
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,362
And he tells me you're
the best person

35
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,096
to handle this for faster results
-No that's not true...

36
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,068
The files are in your car.

37
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,671
Sir may I ask you something?

38
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,067
Whose idea was it to make the CDI?

39
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,778
Why?

40
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,648
What an apt date to celebrate CDI day.

41
00:03:59,038 --> 00:03:59,607
1st April.

42
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:31,681
Give

43
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,728
Enjoy!

44
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:07,669
Khempau

45
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,741
Khempau

46
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,413
Wait a minute!

47
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,152
His phone isn't connecting.

48
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,561
Wait five minutes...

49
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,556
Madam, you have the duplicate key?

50
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:30,430
- Yes

51
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,567
Throw it from the balcony,
I'll go down and catch it.

52
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:34,705
Q Kay-

53
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:07,968
Basanti!

54
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,501
Shruti! Shruti!

55
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,639
Look at what Khempal has done!

56
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,407
Sit... sit...

57
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,213
Sir I had called.

58
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:30,246
Where's the body?

59
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,416
Here in the bedroom.

60
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,464
Goddamn leeches!

61
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,335
Sorry.

62
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:09,422
Same girl?

63
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:10,989
Is this her?

64
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,725
Yes

65
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,433
l-low old is she'?

66
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,371
I mean, was...

67
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:24,972
Fourteen.

68
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,510
Name?

69
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:29,546
Shruti

70
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,510
Servanfs name?

71
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:32,705
Khem pal

72
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:34,717
Your name?

73
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:36,450
Amrish

74
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:42,321
You're a neighbor?

75
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,092
She's my neice...

76
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:49,760
Lift the sheet at least first!

77
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,324
What are you doing Champaklal?!

78
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:52,659
Come Uncle...

79
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,567
Oh these guys are after me!

80
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,100
Yes Sir...

81
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,222
These vultures arrive before
the murder even happens.

82
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:19,392
Stay back!
- Move!

83
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,536
Jai Hind Sir.
- Jai Hind.

84
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,464
Move the bottle.

85
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,165
Sit.

86
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,078
Initial inquiries, Sir.

87
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,209
This is the girl's mother,
that's the father.

88
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:43,576
So...

89
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,088
Any problems in school?

90
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,183
Any boyfriend?

91
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,059
She was 14 years old!

92
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,489
I mean...

93
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,135
Any best friend?

94
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:01,605
A boy?

95
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,298
Or a girl?

96
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,009
Why don't you understand officer?

97
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,176
It's Khempal!

98
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,475
There were four people in the house...

99
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,084
...two are alive, one dead and one missing.

100
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,554
Instead of asking these stupid questions,
go and look for that b******!

101
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:19,749
Volume!

102
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,514
Sir is sitting here.

103
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,392
Dhaniram...

104
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,055
...listen...

105
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,691
It is the servant.

106
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,362
Send one team to the railway station

107
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,503
...one to his house, and neighbours.

108
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,331
And one to the mobile company.

109
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,405
It's an open and shut case!

110
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,213
5 feet 2 inches.

111
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,139
Weight medium.

112
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,145
Color vvheatish

113
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,355
I'm sending you a photo now.
Go and give this quickly.

114
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:06,499
Tell me...

115
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,369
Sir the Gorakhpur express leaves at 7pm.

116
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,308
That means he should still
be in the city somewhere.

117
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,272
Do you have anyone with you
for identification?

118
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,138
Yes Sir.

119
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,277
Dr. Tandon's compounder.

120
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,771
He's also from KhempaPs village

121
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,040
Good.

122
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,175
Q Kay-

123
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,351
Okay Sir.

124
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,124
Khempal is a lustful guy.

125
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,082
And quite randy too.

126
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,393
He had a thing for Shruti baby.

127
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,061
But he's a grandfather...

128
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:35,429
...he even has two grandchildren.

129
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:36,290
So?

130
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,268
He too has a heart that beats...

131
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,633
Is this a murder or a suicide?

132
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,731
You still don't know? It's murder.

133
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,071
The servant killed her and ran away.

134
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,611
Carefully... She's a little girl...!

135
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:50,713
Relax...

136
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:04,760
- Sir! A byte please! -

137
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,697
- Dr.Tandon!
Why did your servant do this? -

138
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:23,243
Sir, the whole room is a blood bath.
The sheets are soaked red.

139
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,643
Yes Sir... I'm at Sameer Vihar...

140
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,243
No Sir, don't say that...

141
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,646
I'll... I'll post someone
else here and come.

142
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,057
Yes Sir... Jai Hind.

143
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:37,753
We've taken the samples right?

144
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,720
So... Can we put them on the terrace to dry?

145
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,063
You can put your sheets...

146
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,062
and your blankets...

147
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,529
...in your cupboards, or lockers
or even where the sun don't shine.

148
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:48,570
What do I care?

149
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:50,265
Right sir.

150
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,134
Am I cracking jokes here?

151
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,242
No Sir. Absolutely right Sir...

152
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:09,759
Sir!

153
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,323
Sir, one minute!

154
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,463
There are blood stains on
the stairs and the door.

155
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,560
Gopal, I'll call you later...

156
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,400
You come along.

157
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:27,270
Key?

158
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,678
It's missing. You can break the lock.

159
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:32,706
Very good!

160
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,513
Thieves break locks. Not cops!

161
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,489
Perched eyes will see water everywhere!

162
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,525
It's just rust, not blood!

163
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:45,392
And what's this?

164
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,393
On the stairs?

165
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,194
That?

166
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,402
That's blood!

167
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:57,333
Yes Sir...

168
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:58,802
I've left Sir...

169
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,276
I'm in the jeep.

170
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:51,392
Mr. and Mrs. Kumar,
you want a divorce on mutual consent

171
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,791
But before giving you
a 6 month trial separation...

172
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,262
I must ask why you want to separate?

173
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:00,964
Mr. Kumar?

174
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,700
I don't have any reason as such.

175
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,138
Mrs. Kumar?

176
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,442
You filed the court papers didn't you?

177
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,439
If there's no reason to separate then
there's no reason to be together either...

178
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,219
We sleep together and wake up
together for no reason.

179
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,219
Fight for no reason.
Love each other for no reason.

180
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,589
Our relationship died years ago.

181
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,153
And we're rotting...

182
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,756
...in the stench of the corpse...
again for no reason.

183
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,265
We also had affairs...

184
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,498
Would you also like to know whom with?

185
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:39,474
Not really...

186
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,333
Go ahead, tell her.

187
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,511
I will if she grants us the divorce faster.

188
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,275
Always great at bullshitting.

189
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,661
Please turn that off.

190
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,302
Hello?

191
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,304
Yes...

192
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,406
What?

193
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,413
We showed him the blood
stains on the lock yesterday.

194
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,210
He ridiculed us.

195
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,548
My uncle finally broke the lock.

196
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,414
Mr. D K Gogia...

197
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,251
Retired police officer.

198
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:34,087
He came as soon as I called him.

199
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,063
Identify the body please.

200
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,400
Took it from all angles?

201
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,314
It does look like Khempal...

202
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:57,620
WOW !

203
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,018
'Looks like'?

204
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,419
What do you mean?

205
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:06,488
Worked for you for two years, didn't he?

206
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,430
Can you come up?

207
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,664
I can't come home with the ashes.

208
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,409
Panditji has said not to...

209
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,607
Leave it in the car.

210
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,417
I'm not leaving her alone.

211
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,594
Do you remember what Khempal
was wearing last night?

212
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,599
Pant and?

213
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,026
Er...

214
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,360
A green T-shirt?

215
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,986
Now one with Pankaj...
- Okay.

216
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,647
One more...

217
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:11,958
Sir!

218
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,452
Sir check this out...

219
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,029
Hold on...

220
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,698
I'll call later...

221
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,337
Would you look at that!

222
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,437
Guess the case is solved!

223
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:27,707
Pandey!

224
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,342
Call the forensics department.
- Yes sir

225
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,391
The body is KhempaPs.

226
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,357
Alright.

227
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,192
And this handprint?

228
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:49,994
Yours?

229
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,063
Sorry.

230
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,735
The Shruti Tandon murder case
keeps twisting and turning.

231
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,302
A new body has been found today.

232
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,709
Apparently this is the body
of the servant...

233
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,605
...who was presumed to be
the killer until now.

234
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:11,745
Name?

235
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,319
Name?

236
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,691
Shruti Tandon.

237
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,619
Age?

238
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,087
14 years.

239
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,132
Date Of birth?

240
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,560
24th March.

241
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,696
Date of death?

242
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,535
15th March.

243
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,176
Time of death?

244
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,815
Sir?

245
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,818
Time of death, please?

246
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,483
Sir?

247
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,794
Sir the killer is very clever...

248
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,291
Does that mean we are buffoons?

249
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,329
If we don't do something quick,

250
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,028
like Nandhari, this case too
will go to the CDI.

251
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,206
And if I get transferred...

252
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,532
...I will not go alone.

253
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,442
Either find the killer,

254
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,770
or find another job!

255
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,604
Yes Sir!

256
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:53,412
Fresh arrivals...

257
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,690
First she was hit on the head...

258
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,394
...with a hammer or a rod...

259
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:06,569
twice.

260
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:08,593
She musfve fallen unconscious.

261
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,072
Then almost half an hour later...

262
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,166
...very carefully, as if by an expert...

263
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,343
...right at the jugular vein...

264
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:17,375
...a long cut.

265
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,409
Number one.

266
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,748
And then for satisfaction,

267
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,114
another small late cut...

268
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:25,217
number two.

269
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:28,557
And the servant?

270
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,125
A Xerox copy.

271
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,128
Xerox copy indeed.

272
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,423
What happened?

273
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,360
Sir it's me, Dhaniram!

274
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:07,654
One minute sir.

275
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:14,299
Sir... a glass broke in the other room...

276
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:17,330
...you were in deep sleep,
tired after a long day's work...

277
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,603
...and you still woke up, immediately!

278
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:20,575
So?

279
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,369
Sir...

280
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:25,113
...two people died in the next room...

281
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,718
...yet Daddy and Mommy kept snoring away.

282
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:30,643
Just think about it Sir.

283
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,452
Check out this email.

284
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,459
This girl is apologizing to her father -

285
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,529
'I'm sorry Daddy, I won't do it again'.

286
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,126
What was this mistake you think?

287
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:54,570
And not just one mistake,
but three of them.

288
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,478
The three mistakes of Chetan Bhagat...

289
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,115
...she was reading this.

290
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,309
We found it in her room.

291
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,480
And here is the internet company's report.

292
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,451
They said, even hours after the girl's death...

293
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:16,055
...the internet router kept
switching on and off.

294
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,328
So if Daddy and Mommy were sleeping...

295
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,526
...and the girl was dead...

296
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,540
...who was switching the router on and off?

297
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,375
The girl's ghost?

298
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,577
Damn right!

299
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,722
There were four people in the house...

300
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,451
...two are alive and two dead.

301
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:45,058
What are you trying to say?

302
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:49,796
Just that there were two murders that night...

303
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:57,134
...and both of you heard nothing...
Not a sound?

304
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,601
The AC in our room is so loud that

305
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,372
you can't hear any outside noise.

306
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,709
Wow that's convenient and
a hell of an AC!

307
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:10,147
So I guess the noise inside the room
can't go outside either eh?

308
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,185
The horniest guy I know is
actually ShrutFs father.

309
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:16,749
Really?!

310
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:20,426
The female doctor in his clinic...

311
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:21,689
Sunita madam?

312
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:22,731
That's the one.

313
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:24,563
He used to hook up with her.

314
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:25,499
Unbelievable!

315
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,227
You loved your daughter a lot didn't you?

316
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:32,305
And your wife?

317
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:34,303
What?

318
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,602
Our marriage is just fine.

319
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,541
Of course, of course!

320
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,515
Every man loves his wife...

321
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,778
And if he doesn't, he at least...

322
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:48,219
pretends like he loves his wife...

323
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,587
And Doctor Mrs Nathani?

324
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:00,060
Did you love her too?

325
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,503
Are you insane?!

326
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,473
Shrieking won't help...

327
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,402
I'm a happily married woman!

328
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:07,336
I know...

329
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:10,647
Sir I've also heard
that this loving couple

330
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,739
used to indulge in some sex switcheroo...

331
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,007
What?

332
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,053
You know what they say in English...

333
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:19,219
You know... switching wives...

334
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,386
...Wife... soap...

335
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,558
Wife swapping?!

336
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,223
L-low is all this connected
with Shrutfs murder'?

337
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,392
Oh it is connected... from both ends.

338
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,427
Shruti got to know what you two were up to...

339
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,399
She had become sad...

340
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:35,501
...always sad.

341
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,634
It's a tragedy dear...

342
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,507
...poor girl was suffering silently.

343
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,539
She could neither tell her friends
nor her relatives...

344
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:46,481
...so who else?

345
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:48,174
Khem pal.

346
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,049
He was very afraid Sir.

347
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,288
He had even told me his life was in danger.

348
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,453
From who?

349
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,150
It was her birthday 8 days later...

350
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,227
...but we gave her gift early...

351
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,035
You have seen the videos from that night...

352
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,604
...we loved her a lot.

353
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,473
For her birthday she had...

354
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,171
...planned a sleepover...

355
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,637
...with her friends.

356
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,476
Planned what with friends?

357
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:21,146
Sleep?

358
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:24,585
What is that?

359
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:30,392
All the kids spend a night together
at one friend's place. Alone.

360
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,061
Without parents around?

361
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,466
And what do they do the whole night'?

362
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,139
You see, all these things...

363
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,765
...are because of the internet...

364
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,648
...it's a wretched place, this internet.

365
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,626
Shruti - that's the girls name.

366
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,524
Correct.

367
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:08,193
She died on 15th March.

368
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,261
And the time?

369
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:13,196
They said she died at 2:00 am.

370
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:16,494
Perfect.

371
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:19,066
Make me a photocopy of this.

372
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:21,666
If you didn't kill her...

373
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,613
...how do you know she died at 2:00 am?

374
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:39,561
Hold it!

375
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,564
We're from the Anti-Corruption Bureau.

376
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:44,422
Hey Guru!

377
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,329
<i>AK! What are you doing here mate'?</i>

378
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:50,097
Got a deputation coming up.

379
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,232
Okay! Where are you off to?

380
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,240
Probably CDI.

381
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,568
But what are you doing here?

382
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:58,673
The double murder case...

383
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,015
that young girl and the servant.

384
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,381
Ah yes yes yes...

385
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,049
Just reporting to the high command.

386
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:05,578
Any leads?

387
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:06,715
We are working on it.

388
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,283
We have cracked it Sir!

389
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:10,151
Sorry Sir.

390
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,692
I've got some fine malt for you - imported!

391
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,155
Why don't you come by?

392
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:20,661
Day after tomorrow?

393
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,270
Done.
- Done

394
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,370
Thank you.
- Okay dear.

395
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:35,574
It's been 1O days!

396
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,019
What has the police
been doing about this case?

397
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,249
Wait. . wait. . wait...

398
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,717
We are pleased to announce...

399
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,587
...that we have solved
the double murder case...

400
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,562
...of Kruti and the servant.

401
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,156
Its, Shruti not Kruti.

402
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:49,126
Sir, Shruti.

403
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,396
Our investigation has discovered that

404
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,199
both the murders have been

405
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,672
committed by the same person.

406
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,649
He found Kruti...
I mean Shruti and Khempal

407
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:10,016
in an objectionable though
not compromising position.

408
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:17,624
Mr. Ramesh?

409
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:27,569
We need to get some identification done.

410
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:37,112
After seeing his daughter
and his servant together,

411
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:42,046
Dr Ramesh killed them both in a fit of anger...

412
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:47,049
though he is as characterless
as his daughter was!

413
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,550
What I say, he is as characterless,
as his daughter was...

414
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:51,652
[Reporter] What do you mean characterless?

415
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:57,726
There's a new twist and a new killer
in the double murder case.

416
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,767
This is a simple and straight case of honor killing.

417
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:10,702
Nutan?

418
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:12,411
Where are you both?

419
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:13,582
Where is Ramesh?

420
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,442
We're in a police building...

421
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:20,745
...they've taken Ramesh in
for some identification.

422
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:22,447
Listen to me...

423
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,225
...they're saying he killed her!

424
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:27,085
They're saying Ramesh killed Shruti and Khempal!

425
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:28,629
What!

426
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,462
What do you mean? Who is saying that?

427
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:32,668
Listen.

428
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:36,665
Police say Shruti and KhempaPs murderer is

429
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,231
none other than Shruti's father Ramesh Tandon.

430
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,038
This is a simple and straight
case of Honour Killing.

431
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,309
Where is Ramesh?

432
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:46,244
He's inside.

433
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:47,541
Ma'am, you're not allowed there.

434
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,142
What do you mean not allowed?
I'm his vvife!

435
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,784
Open the door!

436
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:52,551
What happened?

437
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,746
My husband Dr Ramesh Tandon,

438
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,417
he's been locked up inside.

439
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,525
There's no one inside,

440
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,117
take a look...

441
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:10,629
Satisfied?

442
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,342
I want to speak to my lawyer.

443
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,740
A lawyer is of no use now.

444
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,248
Confess, and you'll get away
with a lighter punishment.

445
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:29,354
Yours is the rarest of the rare cases.

446
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,257
You'll be hung, and it'll be
granted by a fast track court.

447
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,700
Why would I kill my own daughter?

448
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,499
I've already told you why you did it.

449
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,437
Should I also tell you how?

450
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,571
You were working on your laptop till late that night.

451
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,310
You drink everynight, anyway...

452
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:01,290
But that night you had a few extra, perhaps...

453
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,461
Khempal, get some ice.

454
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,302
Khem pal.

455
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,733
Nutan... help please!

456
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:19,412
After committing both murders,
you cleaned the blood in the room...

457
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:26,557
...wiped your fingerprints off everything.

458
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:32,591
The bed... the room...
you dressed it all up very nicely.

459
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:39,001
Satisfied with everything,
you relaxed with another drink.

460
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,339
Would you like to confess now?

461
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:49,675
Please...

462
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:55,122
Please. let me talk to my wife...

463
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,192
---my lawyer...

464
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,528
I didn't do this...

465
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:05,159
I didn't kill my daughter...
Please believe me!

466
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,732
Sir please!

467
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,073
Please... I did not kill her.

468
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:12,205
Please Sir...

469
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:14,241
Please!

470
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:20,046
This is the compound!
This is where it happened!

471
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,616
Shruti was killed here!

472
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,283
This is the house
where Shruti was born...

473
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:29,553
...this is the room where she grew up.

474
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:35,121
This is the room where that
bloodcurdling nightmare happened!

475
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,129
This is where Shruti
was brutally murdered...

476
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:41,563
...where a father was overcome
by anger and reacted violently...

477
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:45,503
...vvhen he saw his
daughter with the servant

478
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,133
in a compromising position!

479
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:50,403
A street dog barking at
night keeps us awake...

480
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,606
...and their daughter was
murdered in the next room

481
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,376
yet they never woke up?

482
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,346
It's not just fishy... it's a fishmarket!

483
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:00,018
We all have boyfriends...

484
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:02,024
but an old man?
Yuck!

485
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:06,086
And suddenly one morning,
our family was finished...

486
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:11,592
Before we could even mourn over our loss,
they arrested him.

487
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,332
Shruti was RamesHs everything.

488
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,668
He had never even so much as slapped her,

489
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,637
yet the police, media everybody is saying...

490
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,483
I have faith in the legal system.

491
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,180
I hope justice is done.

492
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:34,355
Of course.

493
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:39,691
<i>The day the sky is unscathed</i>

494
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:47,993
<i>the face of the moon unblemished,</i>

495
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:56,001
<i>the day Time awakens</i>

496
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,244
<i>justice! justice!</i>

497
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:04,013
<i>justice shall be served!</i>

498
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,990
If you have just lost your child...

499
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:12,425
that also under really horrible circumstances...

500
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,596
l-low can you be so clinical and so logical?

501
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,563
I saw Mrs Tandon's interview
on your channel.

502
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:23,400
I felt as if perhaps she isn't
even their own daughter...

503
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,435
...she may be adopted...

504
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,975
...I suggest we should have a DNA test done.

505
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,511
DNA test suggests Delhi's famous socialite Shoma
Ray.

506
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:35,348
Blood relation or not...

507
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:44,152
...the police has no right to defame
such a small child, who is dead!

508
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:48,228
I think that policeman should not be
allowed to remain on his post.

509
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,464
After going through the case details,

510
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:57,529
the Home Ministry has requested the
CDI to take over the case...

511
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:01,107
Based on the findings of the
CDPs investigation...

512
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:05,580
further action will be taken
against whomsoever it may be.

513
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:10,208
After the embarrassing work
by the police, the CDI team

514
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:12,083
has now arrived in the area.

515
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,156
The case will now be handled by

516
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,088
CDI joint director Ashvvin Kumar.

517
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,257
Doctor, this is the girl's room...

518
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,618
...that's the servant's room...

519
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,189
...lets get cracking!

520
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,180
Found anything?

521
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:28,022
2-3 bottles of beer and wine,
and some toiletries in the bathroom...

522
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,262
'Serve you parents... take them
to the four holy shrines'

523
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:37,296
'Feeding a cow would help
rid the house of evil spirits'

524
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,798
'Feeding a dog will defeat your enemies'

525
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,509
Did Khempal drink?

526
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,307
Occasionally or everyday?

527
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:53,288
He never touched alcohol.

528
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:58,054
He smoked beedis though,
on the terrace.

529
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:58,819
Sir?

530
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,126
Could you come here for a second?

531
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,164
OKay...

532
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,634
Whose bottles are these?

533
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,302
I don't know...

534
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:26,011
Sir these bloodstains are not only
between the terrace and Tandon's flat...

535
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,022
...they are on the lower floors
as well, going clown.

536
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:36,424
They could have been made when
the police was bringing the body down?

537
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,328
Possible, Sir...

538
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,127
...totally contrary to the FIR.

539
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,571
That means Khempal walked
to the terrace himself...

540
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:45,201
...alive...

541
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,400
Ah! We only need some
background music now...

542
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,270
You are truly Sherlock Holmes, Vedant!

543
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,677
You flatter me Sir!

544
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:08,185
Have a seat.

545
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:15,266
Ahh goddamn it! You fool!

546
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:22,610
Dr. Tandon, I'm Ashvvin Kumar
I'm handling your case...

547
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,705
What time did you go to sleep
on the night of 15th March?

548
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,508
<i>Around 11 pm...</i>

549
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:35,223
That night, the internet router
switched on and off

550
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,190
a number of times
between 11:30pm and 6am...

551
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,623
Any explanation?

552
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:42,553
No.

553
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,289
What time did you wake up
the ne><t morning?

554
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:20,133
Khempar;

555
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:23,136
Khempar;

556
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,101
Wait a minute...

557
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:51,760
The number you've called is unavailable.

558
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,138
His phone isn't connecting.

559
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,029
Sit for five minutes.

560
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,633
Madam? You have the duplicate keys right?

561
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:02,635
Yes...

562
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,407
Throw them from the balcony,
I'll go down and catch it.

563
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,104
Q Kay-

564
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,139
Ramesh!

565
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:47,544
Shruti! Shruti!

566
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:00,395
- Madam!

567
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:02,503
Look at what Khempal has done!

568
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,665
- Sir a byte? -

569
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:18,577
We didn't even get enough time
to cry and mourn her death...

570
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:23,278
They saw-

571
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,184
...after we killed her...

572
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,714
...we cleaned her blood...

573
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:34,218
...wiped our fingerprints...

574
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:53,214
...cleaned her private parts...

575
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,115
...and drank whiskey...

576
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:30,012
I wouldn't even be able to inject
her gums before treating her cavities...

577
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,321
...and they're saying I slit her throat...

578
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:37,350
There were two murders
beyond your bedroom wall...

579
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:41,351
...you didn't hear anything at all?

580
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:48,333
I have told the police already
about our bedroom AC...

581
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,332
...it had been faulty since many days...

582
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:59,503
...it makes so much noise that
it's impossible to hear anything outside.

583
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,316
Sorry... what did you tell the police?

584
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:20,026
You couldn't hear anything?

585
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:21,558
Nope.

586
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:30,127
Sir, a normal AC runs at 5O - 75 decibels,
this AC is reaching 85 - 9O decibels...

587
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:34,067
...it is impossible for any outside
noise to be heard inside.

588
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:47,154
Hey Basu! Hope A. R. Rahman
doesn't steal you away from us!

589
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,053
Chief!

590
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,158
There's a bit of confusion...

591
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,565
The bloody hand print on the terrace...

592
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:02,365
...there's no analysis report on it.

593
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:03,199
Why not?

594
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,468
No idea what these jokers have done.

595
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:11,139
Dhaniram?

596
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:12,442
Yes Sir...

597
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:16,039
Where has the print vanished?

598
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,348
There was unseasonal rain on 18th March...

599
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,185
it must have washed away.

600
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:26,624
But the forensics department says they never
got any information about a blood print.

601
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:28,362
That's weird...

602
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,155
I gave it myself...

603
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,234
...I think there has been some misunderstanding.

604
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,071
You informed Forensics, right?
- Yes sir, absolutely.

605
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,497
How?
- We phoned them.

606
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:39,571
Who phoned them?

607
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:41,499
I had told Pandey...

608
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:45,041
Pandey, you called Forensics, right?
- Yes sir, absolutely sir...

609
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:48,212
...but my outgoing was blocked
so I told Suresh to do it.

610
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:52,580
Sir I had gone with you on the PM duty,
but I'd told Qureshi to do it.

611
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:56,520
- And where's Qureshi? -
He's gone home for his daughter's wedding...

612
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:03,427
You, bloody good for nothing idiot!
What am I supposed to say to Sir now?

613
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,622
Say sorry to the boss now!
Sorry, Sir...

614
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:08,066
It's okay. But next time there's a murder

615
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:09,398
and the killer leaves a bloody hand print.

616
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,368
...just be more careful about it, okay?

617
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:13,269
- Yes sir... -
Very good!

618
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:22,047
L-low do you know
she died at 2:00 am'?

619
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:26,449
Sir?

620
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:28,351
Time of death?

621
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,684
Sir, if you don't tell me the time of death...

622
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:35,024
...I cannot complete the rituals
of immersing the ashes.

623
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:37,460
- Panditji... -

624
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:41,491
...the death occurred between
11:00 pm and 6:00 am.

625
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,538
You could enter it as 2:00 am.

626
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,669
2:00 in the morning

627
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:53,571
I just made a rough guess...

628
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,328
I'm going to ask a few questions...

629
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,734
...just answer in
a simple yes or no.

630
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,030
Is your name Ramesh Tandon?

631
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,306
Yes.

632
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:25,107
Is your wife's name Nutan Tandon?

633
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:26,512
Yes.

634
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,610
Are you sure your husband has not killed
your daughter Shruti?

635
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:33,143
Yes.

636
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:39,090
Did you suspect there was anything
between Shruti and Khempal?

637
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,320
No.

638
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:45,460
Is your husband short tempered?

639
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,330
No.

640
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,491
- Are you sure? -

641
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,170
<i>Mrs Tandem'?</i>

642
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:53,166
Yes.

643
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:57,543
When you entered ShrutFs room,
was she alive?

644
00:53:58,335 --> 00:53:59,075
No.

645
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:03,017
Shruti's door could be unlocked
from the outside, only with a key?

646
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,541
Yes.

647
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:09,146
You left the key in the lock that night?

648
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,415
Yes.

649
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,152
Deliberately?

650
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,289
No.

651
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:22,329
Do you have anything to do
with your daughter's murder?

652
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:23,698
No!

653
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:45,315
What's in this?

654
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:47,160
Your things...

655
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,451
My things...

656
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,547
Both of you sign here...

657
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:22,395
Your trial separation period
starts tomorrow...

658
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,438
Thank you, I'll take your leave.

659
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,051
Have you seen the film "ljaazat"?

660
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:49,317
No... Why'?

661
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,355
Just asked...

662
00:55:57,754 --> 00:56:07,402
[Sings] Some of my things
still remain with you..

663
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,509
So basically we get nothing.

664
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:17,978
Nope. In such cases everything depends
on the first investigation team...

665
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,151
...and as you can see,
the first team did a bang up job...

666
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:24,421
Any possible prints or DNA samples,
they're all...

667
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:28,561
Yes, I know, I know... it's all contaminated,
the crime scene was heavily compromised...

668
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,393
But I don't need a sermon,
I need a solution Dr. Swamy!

669
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:34,359
I'm so sorry...
- Damn!

670
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:40,367
Jai Hind Sir.

671
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,168
- Take a seat. -

672
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:52,479
Whose idea was it?

673
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:53,644
Which idea, Sir?

674
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,387
The honor killing one...

675
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,388
My experience Sir...

676
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:00,121
the fruit of days and
nights of hard work...

677
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,693
...it was a very
difficult investigation...

678
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:02,688
Very difficult.

679
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,224
Ah, 'lnvestigatiow!

680
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:07,733
So you were the first one
to arrive at the scene?

681
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:08,695
Yes Sir.

682
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,570
And what did you do?

683
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:14,575
The servant was missing,
so we began looking for him...

684
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:17,977
You didn't call the forensics team
to collect prints and samples?

685
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:22,476
Sniffer dogs?

686
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:24,413
Err... No Sir...

687
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:28,455
Was there a cooler
panel on KhempaPs body?

688
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:32,251
Er... why yes Sir, there was...

689
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:34,124
Who must have kept it?

690
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:37,064
Who would have kept it?

691
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,303
So why didn't you take it
for fingerprints?

692
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:50,508
The cooler was heavy and...
I was being treated for haemorrhoids...

693
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:52,179
Oh! okay okay.

694
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:53,740
You're cured now?

695
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,677
From the piles?

696
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:59,178
I'm better now Sir, thank you.

697
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:02,717
Shall we check? Take off your pants...

698
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:03,586
Huh?

699
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,658
Take off your pants...

700
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,460
TAKE THEM OFF!

701
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:08,995
Dhaniram...

702
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:13,366
Nutan called Khempal at 6:02 am
on his cell...

703
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,104
It rang, was answered,
then disconnected,

704
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,001
then switched off, right?

705
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:22,671
Did you follow up
with the mobile server?

706
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:26,072
The servant was missing, so
we assumed he was the killer...

707
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:28,271
...and began searching for him...

708
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:31,179
Well done!

709
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:38,385
There was a rod here...

710
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:39,558
...look for it.

711
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:43,693
Look for the rod...

712
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:45,695
Take off your pants!

713
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:47,329
Sir, I've been a cop for ten years...

714
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,694
Strip, and search for the rod...

715
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:18,056
Sir, I've worked for ten years...

716
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:22,231
At 06:02 when the phone connected,
where was it?

717
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,295
I don't know Sir!

718
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,372
Within the radius of the crime scene!

719
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:31,000
Can a dead man answer his phone?

720
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,201
No Sir.

721
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:33,713
Did you find out who answered the call?

722
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:35,038
No Sir!

723
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:43,352
Not a single fingerprint is clear...

724
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:46,193
You morons call this an 'investigation'?

725
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:48,324
I'm sorry sir...

726
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:52,231
You turned the crime scene
into a fish market!

727
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,634
Passers by... relatives... neighbours... journalists...

728
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:57,399
...all strolling around
like it's a public garden!

729
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,304
If you had a little intelligence,

730
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:03,604
...even a minuscule ounce of it...

731
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,578
...this case would've been solved right then!

732
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:11,114
I'm sorry Sir...
I was facing a lot of pressure...

733
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:29,335
Was any of ShrutFs blood
found on her parents' clothes?

734
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:30,403
Yes Sir.

735
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:32,669
Any of the servant's blood?

736
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:34,140
No Sir.

737
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,744
The blood of both the vicitms was
found in the room?

738
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:39,546
No Sir, only the girl's blood...

739
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:42,539
The parents had cleaned
up the servant's blood...

740
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,388
What was the color of the girl's blood?
Red?

741
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,124
Ivlusfve been red, right?

742
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:52,822
Yes Sir...

743
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:54,687
And the servant's was blue?

744
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,062
That's hovv they must've cleaned only
the servant's blood, right?

745
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:02,296
By cleaning up all the blue stuff?

746
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:07,401
Even if a drop of the servant's blood
had fallen in the room...

747
01:01:08,431 --> 01:01:10,308
...and even if they had cleaned it...

748
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,580
...the forensic scientists
would have still found out.

749
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:21,022
This 'honor killing'...
whose bright idea was it?

750
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:28,651
Speak up.

751
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:34,257
Ramesh Sir used to talk
on the mobile phone for hours...

752
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:36,366
...with Sunita Madam.

753
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,672
And...

754
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:44,305
Whenever Nutan Madam used to be
out of station for her lectures...

755
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:51,178
They used to lock themselves
inside the clinic and...

756
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:53,586
What did they do?

757
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,584
I guess they would chat...

758
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:58,790
Is that what you guys call it?

759
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,667
Oh Sir, you're funny...

760
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:10,435
l-low many years have you
worked with Tanclon'?

761
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:14,331
I guess... around four years...

762
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,737
What else did you see?

763
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:21,272
There was a depression in the cot...

764
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,677
...like someone had sat on it.

765
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:27,755
A few bottles... glasses...

766
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:31,184
...and the toilet was so dirty!

767
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,056
Like the Jamuna ghat!

768
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:39,799
But surely... there were other people
in the house that night...

769
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:44,035
Did you notice anything unusual in
Dr. Ramesns behavior?

770
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:47,774
No, I don't remember...

771
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,505
Anything unusual at work?

772
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:58,718
Kanhaiya!

773
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,278
Yes Sir?
- What is this'?

774
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:02,355
What the hell is this?

775
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,352
Haven't you learned anything
all these years?

776
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:06,584
Can't even make a cast properly!

777
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:11,222
If you can't do your job properly
then leave!

778
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:13,430
This happened a week
before ShrutFs death...

779
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:17,001
I'd never seen Ramesh so angry...

780
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:18,537
Bmwm!

781
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:22,642
It was very strange because
it was a very small thing...

782
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,772
All of Tandon's staff... everyone in the colony

783
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:31,780
servants, maids...
round everyone up immediately.

784
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:32,778
Yes Chief.

785
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:36,147
If any of you lie... you'll be held

786
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:38,214
as accomplice for the murder...

787
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:41,519
The killer will be hung...

788
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:43,696
and the liar will
get life imprisonment.

789
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,101
I've already said everything I know.

790
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:51,670
I didn't have much
to do with Tandon Sir...

791
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:56,374
At times Shruti baby used to give me

792
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:59,811
some errands to run and that's it.

793
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:02,642
Sir, I'm an insomniac...

794
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:04,742
...that's why I work as a watchman.

795
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:09,152
Sometimes these people would meet

796
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:12,091
in KhempaPs room and play cards.

797
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:14,562
Kanhaiya and Khempal are from the same village.

798
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,357
I don't know anything,

799
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:18,690
I'm just the laundry guy.

800
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,168
Yes, I have a boyfriend Sir...

801
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:23,294
...but he's married to someone else.

802
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:30,471
Sir I think the Doctor only
has committed the murder.

803
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:34,512
That night no one entered or exited the house.

804
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:37,050
Whoever won the card game

805
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:38,413
would buy drinks for everyone.

806
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:39,752
Yes Sir I remember...

807
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:42,647
Kanhaiya was very angry

808
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:44,690
the day the Doctor shouted at him...

809
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:47,654
Enough is enough!

810
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,730
He called me a b******
in front of everyone...

811
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:51,061
l-low could he'?!

812
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:52,231
I will make him pay for this one!

813
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:56,299
Relax... He just lost his temper...

814
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,429
He's a good man...

815
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,437
I will take my revenge at any cost...

816
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:02,499
<i>I wil I sho w him h e
real b****** _ IS!</i>

817
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,179
Are you sure about this?

818
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,415
Sir, whatever the parents have said so far

819
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:16,013
in the investigation,
has turned out to be true.

820
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:19,153
Nutan had called Khempal in the morning...

821
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:23,060
Then the AC sound test in the room...

822
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,330
They even passed the polygraph tests

823
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:27,662
without a hitch.

824
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,740
You better hope all this
turns out to be wrong.

825
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:37,066
Or the torture and injustice

826
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:38,407
that the parents have
been put through...

827
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,672
One won't be able to
make amends for it...

828
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:43,775
Ever...

829
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:46,412
Ashwin...

830
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,249
Have you seen the statue of justice?

831
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:54,452
It is blindfolded...

832
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,360
...and one hand holds a weight balance...

833
01:05:57,253 --> 01:06:00,132
People often don't notice

834
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:02,497
that the other hand holds a sword.

835
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:08,168
<i>The sword in the hands of justice is us...</i>

836
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:09,332
us cops...

837
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,046
But in the last 6O years,

838
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:14,547
the sword has become rusty...

839
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,483
And until the rust is cleaned off,

840
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:24,157
<i>this is how it will be... how it will stay.</i>

841
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:30,027
I'm retiring on the 19th of next month.

842
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,555
I know...

843
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:37,227
You have 32 days...

844
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,238
...to clean the rust off the sword.

845
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:47,341
<i>The day the sky is unscathed</i>

846
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:55,278
<i>the face of the moon unblemished,</i>

847
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:04,263
<i>the day Time awakens</i>

848
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:08,993
<i>justice! justice!</i>

849
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:11,298
<i>justice shall be served!</i>

850
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:22,115
Nothing in here...

851
01:07:23,074 --> 01:07:24,018
I'll check on the other side.

852
01:07:29,514 --> 01:07:31,551
Basu! Find anything?

853
01:07:31,616 --> 01:07:33,095
Looking Sir.

854
01:07:42,627 --> 01:07:43,662
- Ashwin... -

855
01:07:51,703 --> 01:07:53,148
Please keep this.

856
01:08:03,982 --> 01:08:04,722
Hey...

857
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:06,687
What... is this?

858
01:08:14,192 --> 01:08:16,433
I think we've found
our murder weapon...

859
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,572
Yes Vedant...

860
01:08:24,669 --> 01:08:26,376
We've got permission for the Narco test...

861
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:29,310
Good... very good!

862
01:08:39,117 --> 01:08:41,461
Investigative officers are
not allowed in Narco tests.

863
01:08:41,686 --> 01:08:44,223
Doc I'm on the verge
of solving this case...

864
01:08:44,288 --> 01:08:46,666
I just need one breakthrough!

865
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:47,663
Pestering like a child!

866
01:08:47,992 --> 01:08:49,665
You know I can't help you with this...

867
01:08:50,161 --> 01:08:51,606
Okay, could you give me your phone?

868
01:08:53,331 --> 01:08:54,401
Who are you calling?

869
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,335
Calling myself.

870
01:08:59,103 --> 01:09:00,343
I think he picked up... Please speak!

871
01:09:00,571 --> 01:09:02,551
Hello... Dr. Svvamy?

872
01:09:03,007 --> 01:09:03,542
What is this?

873
01:09:03,608 --> 01:09:04,518
This is a live telecast...

874
01:09:04,575 --> 01:09:05,451
Don't hang up...

875
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:07,250
We're not breaking the law, okay?

876
01:09:08,312 --> 01:09:09,689
If I need to ask any questions

877
01:09:09,747 --> 01:09:11,658
I'll text doctor Mohanty.

878
01:09:13,284 --> 01:09:15,093
Thank you!

879
01:09:29,967 --> 01:09:31,139
This is Sodium Pentathol.

880
01:09:31,536 --> 01:09:33,447
You will feel a bit drowsy...

881
01:09:34,138 --> 01:09:36,448
...but you will remain awake.

882
01:09:49,387 --> 01:09:50,331
He is stable...

883
01:09:50,721 --> 01:09:52,166
...you can begin now.

884
01:09:56,327 --> 01:09:57,601
Kanhaiya?

885
01:09:58,596 --> 01:09:59,666
Kanhaiya?

886
01:10:00,565 --> 01:10:02,044
Yes Sir.

887
01:10:02,133 --> 01:10:04,374
Tell us something about
Shruti and Khempal?

888
01:10:05,436 --> 01:10:08,042
Was there really something
going on between them?

889
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:11,550
Kanhaiya?

890
01:10:15,713 --> 01:10:16,487
No Sir.

891
01:10:17,615 --> 01:10:21,256
He loved her like his own daughter...

892
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:22,392
Then?

893
01:10:23,688 --> 01:10:26,430
RP was the one who loved her...

894
01:10:28,993 --> 01:10:29,994
Who is RP?

895
01:10:31,529 --> 01:10:33,031
Rajpal...

896
01:10:34,532 --> 01:10:36,478
Nathani Sir's driver.

897
01:10:37,235 --> 01:10:39,272
When was the last time
you met Khempal?

898
01:10:45,543 --> 01:10:46,954
At the Rockhouse...

899
01:10:47,445 --> 01:10:50,187
What is Rockhouse?

900
01:10:57,088 --> 01:11:02,504
'Resham... Resham... Resham Resham..'

901
01:11:16,641 --> 01:11:20,020
Kanhaiya... pour me another one...

902
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:23,124
Make another one!

903
01:11:35,092 --> 01:11:36,662
What the hell Kanhaiya!

904
01:11:37,428 --> 01:11:40,272
Worked for so long and still
haven't learned a thing?

905
01:11:40,565 --> 01:11:42,044
This is funny huh?

906
01:11:45,002 --> 01:11:45,946
Piss me off some more

907
01:11:46,003 --> 01:11:47,004
and I'll pull the doctor's entrails

908
01:11:47,071 --> 01:11:48,106
inside out right now!

909
01:11:50,341 --> 01:11:51,547
Quiet guys... quiet down!

910
01:11:52,343 --> 01:11:53,321
Everyone is asleep.

911
01:11:56,013 --> 01:11:57,321
Everyone is asleep!

912
01:12:02,987 --> 01:12:04,728
My love must be awake though eh?

913
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:08,129
Stop talking loosely about the girl!

914
01:12:08,492 --> 01:12:09,527
She's like a daughter to me...

915
01:12:09,994 --> 01:12:11,405
Sure, like a daughter...

916
01:12:11,996 --> 01:12:13,100
Sorry father-in-law!

917
01:12:15,533 --> 01:12:17,240
That's enough! Leave now...

918
01:12:18,269 --> 01:12:19,043
I need to sleep...

919
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:21,207
Get some more booze... this is empty...

920
01:12:21,939 --> 01:12:22,576
From where?

921
01:12:23,107 --> 01:12:24,347
From the doctor's bar...

922
01:12:27,278 --> 01:12:28,188
He got scared!

923
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,520
I'll lose my job...

924
01:12:31,282 --> 01:12:32,955
I'll buy you a new bottle in the morning...

925
01:12:33,484 --> 01:12:34,155
I promise.

926
01:12:34,452 --> 01:12:36,432
Wait I'll get it.

927
01:13:31,976 --> 01:13:33,148
What the hell are you guys doing?

928
01:13:34,312 --> 01:13:35,256
Get back inside.

929
01:13:36,981 --> 01:13:38,426
Let's get back inside!

930
01:13:38,616 --> 01:13:39,560
Cheers.

931
01:13:41,652 --> 01:13:43,256
One more drink please
- Are you crazy?

932
01:13:43,321 --> 01:13:45,460
Just one more... Last!

933
01:13:53,097 --> 01:13:54,075
Khemu uncle?

934
01:13:54,699 --> 01:13:55,643
Stop him!

935
01:13:55,933 --> 01:13:56,934
Keep quiet!

936
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:00,580
Papa!

937
01:14:02,973 --> 01:14:03,678
Quiet!

938
01:14:04,208 --> 01:14:05,118
Make her quiet.

939
01:14:08,279 --> 01:14:09,986
Are you mad!

940
01:14:11,549 --> 01:14:12,653
What to do?!

941
01:14:12,717 --> 01:14:13,661
Hit her!

942
01:14:24,462 --> 01:14:25,406
Kanhaiya...

943
01:14:28,966 --> 01:14:29,569
Quiet!

944
01:14:30,501 --> 01:14:31,445
Hold her down!

945
01:14:34,505 --> 01:14:36,143
Hit her hard with the Khukhri!

946
01:14:41,912 --> 01:14:42,652
Kanhaiya...

947
01:14:47,485 --> 01:14:48,429
Kanhaiya...

948
01:14:48,686 --> 01:14:50,393
Did you kill her with the Khukri?

949
01:14:51,922 --> 01:14:54,368
Did you murder her with the Khukri?

950
01:14:55,693 --> 01:14:56,603
Kanhaiya!

951
01:14:56,694 --> 01:14:57,331
Madam...

952
01:14:57,928 --> 01:14:58,406
Please stop!

953
01:15:04,201 --> 01:15:06,511
Call up doctor Ivlohanty.

954
01:15:11,442 --> 01:15:12,045
Hello...

955
01:15:12,309 --> 01:15:13,287
Hello Ashwin...

956
01:15:13,611 --> 01:15:14,555
I'm at work.

957
01:15:15,112 --> 01:15:16,523
Oh sorry, I'll call later.

958
01:15:17,148 --> 01:15:18,092
No it's ok... tell me...

959
01:15:18,549 --> 01:15:21,189
Do you remember the name

960
01:15:21,252 --> 01:15:23,198
of my migraine pills?

961
01:15:24,255 --> 01:15:26,667
The Doctor is not answering his phone...

962
01:15:28,559 --> 01:15:30,664
Relpax.

963
01:15:31,929 --> 01:15:34,409
Yes, thank you I just
couldn't remember...

964
01:15:36,901 --> 01:15:38,574
Are you watching the film 'ljaazat?

965
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,417
Yes...

966
01:15:43,974 --> 01:15:45,180
Chief!

967
01:15:47,044 --> 01:15:47,613
What happened?

968
01:15:47,678 --> 01:15:49,123
His BP has crashed.

969
01:15:52,049 --> 01:15:53,392
Give the phone to DrSwamy.

970
01:15:55,586 --> 01:15:56,155
Hello...

971
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:57,255
Just a little while longer DrSvvamy...

972
01:15:57,321 --> 01:15:58,561
We're almost there!

973
01:15:58,956 --> 01:15:59,934
- There is a problem... -

974
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:01,230
I have to stop this!

975
01:16:01,292 --> 01:16:02,930
- It's been more than 3 hours... -

976
01:16:03,327 --> 01:16:06,103
Doctor... It will take weeks to get
permission from the court...

977
01:16:06,931 --> 01:16:07,409
- Please. -

978
01:16:07,465 --> 01:16:08,375
I'm sorry Ashwin...

979
01:16:08,532 --> 01:16:09,442
I really can't help this.

980
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,604
We have to stop this now.

981
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:12,113
This is very dangerous.

982
01:16:12,503 --> 01:16:14,244
- I'm sorry Ashwin. I can't! -

983
01:16:34,191 --> 01:16:35,101
Rajpal...

984
01:16:36,193 --> 01:16:37,536
Do you watch Rockhouse?

985
01:16:39,897 --> 01:16:40,898
Yes...

986
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:45,280
Without fail...

987
01:16:46,003 --> 01:16:47,949
When did you see it last?

988
01:16:51,008 --> 01:16:52,612
In Khemu's room.

989
01:16:54,178 --> 01:16:56,624
Do you remember which song you saw?

990
01:17:00,284 --> 01:17:02,924
Resham... ReshammResham...

991
01:17:15,099 --> 01:17:16,043
Rajpal...

992
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,407
Why did you kill Shruti?

993
01:17:20,204 --> 01:17:22,184
Shruti - why did you kill her?

994
01:17:25,476 --> 01:17:27,513
I... I didn't kill Shruti...

995
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:28,718
Then?

996
01:17:29,413 --> 01:17:32,519
In fact I loved her very much...

997
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:39,133
Everything went wrong...

998
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:42,329
...on that drunken night.

999
01:17:42,393 --> 01:17:43,337
What went wrong?

1000
01:17:45,095 --> 01:17:47,132
Kanhaiya was the one responsible...

1001
01:17:47,965 --> 01:17:48,705
Kanhaiya?

1002
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:52,340
Ask Bhakbhakaun...

1003
01:17:54,371 --> 01:17:56,044
Bak... who?

1004
01:17:57,074 --> 01:17:58,280
Bhak... Bhakbakau...

1005
01:17:59,376 --> 01:18:01,322
He was there too...

1006
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:07,563
Who is this Bhakbhakaun?

1007
01:18:08,152 --> 01:18:11,292
BhaK. bakau...

1008
01:18:16,393 --> 01:18:17,701
What the hell have you guys done?!

1009
01:18:18,596 --> 01:18:20,542
Nothing happened! Don't worry!

1010
01:18:21,265 --> 01:18:23,370
Look... look...

1011
01:18:25,235 --> 01:18:26,236
She's breathing...

1012
01:18:26,604 --> 01:18:28,083
...she's still breathing...

1013
01:18:29,106 --> 01:18:30,585
She just got scared and fainted.

1014
01:18:31,008 --> 01:18:32,282
Everything will be okay...

1015
01:18:32,576 --> 01:18:34,249
Hey Bhakbhakaun!

1016
01:18:44,488 --> 01:18:46,695
I'll wake everyone up and
tell them what happened!

1017
01:18:47,157 --> 01:18:49,535
Are you crazy?
We'll all be behind bars!

1018
01:18:50,527 --> 01:18:53,667
Let's go to the terrace
and think clearly...

1019
01:18:54,331 --> 01:18:55,309
You're our brother...

1020
01:18:56,033 --> 01:18:59,310
we'll do whatever you say...

1021
01:19:00,404 --> 01:19:01,474
Come on!

1022
01:19:10,447 --> 01:19:12,222
If you want to run away then run!

1023
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:15,196
I'm going to tell Sir everything!

1024
01:19:15,252 --> 01:19:17,459
I don't care if I go to jail
or get hanged!

1025
01:19:19,089 --> 01:19:20,159
Khemu listen!

1026
01:19:20,691 --> 01:19:22,102
My uncle is a cop back home...

1027
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:24,401
Once we cross the border

1028
01:19:24,628 --> 01:19:26,130
no one will catch us!

1029
01:19:26,296 --> 01:19:28,242
You met him at the wedding, remember?

1030
01:21:49,273 --> 01:21:50,581
Who is this Bhakbhakaun?

1031
01:21:52,943 --> 01:21:53,683
No idea Sir...

1032
01:21:58,148 --> 01:22:00,059
Become a witness and you'll be saved...

1033
01:22:01,952 --> 01:22:03,056
It's all a lie Sir...

1034
01:22:03,954 --> 01:22:04,694
- I didn't do anything. -

1035
01:22:05,656 --> 01:22:07,294
You shot me up with drugs and

1036
01:22:07,357 --> 01:22:08,597
made me say whatever
you wanted to hear...

1037
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:18,675
And made you sing too?

1038
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:27,480
Resham... ReshammResham...

1039
01:22:48,198 --> 01:22:48,972
Want to see a film?

1040
01:22:49,066 --> 01:22:50,067
You said some interesting things in it.

1041
01:22:50,567 --> 01:22:54,413
My lawyer says your film
cannot play in court.

1042
01:22:55,105 --> 01:22:55,583
<i>M **~w~~wl</i>

1043
01:22:56,306 --> 01:22:56,977
What did you say?

1044
01:22:57,441 --> 01:22:58,351
What does that mean?

1045
01:22:59,009 --> 01:23:00,010
He sang the song right?

1046
01:23:00,611 --> 01:23:01,521
So ask him.

1047
01:23:02,646 --> 01:23:04,592
Don't touch me!

1048
01:23:05,015 --> 01:23:07,188
Hey Vedant wait...

1049
01:23:08,051 --> 01:23:08,961
No... no... don't...

1050
01:23:10,053 --> 01:23:10,963
Don't touch me!

1051
01:23:11,955 --> 01:23:12,729
Stop...

1052
01:23:14,625 --> 01:23:16,536
If our Welfare Group gets to know,

1053
01:23:16,593 --> 01:23:17,628
they won't spare you...

1054
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:29,412
It doesn't matter if the film
plays in court or not...

1055
01:23:32,142 --> 01:23:33,621
But your 'The End' is certain.

1056
01:23:38,615 --> 01:23:41,255
Chief! The TV channel has confirmed...

1057
01:23:42,019 --> 01:23:43,362
...that song was telecast

1058
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:45,297
on their Rockhouse program that night.

1059
01:23:52,195 --> 01:23:53,970
Who the heck is this Bhakbhakaun?

1060
01:23:57,534 --> 01:23:59,480
Call all of them again for questioning.

1061
01:24:09,479 --> 01:24:10,321
Sir.

1062
01:24:10,514 --> 01:24:11,993
Congratulations!

1063
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:14,088
The blood found

1064
01:24:14,151 --> 01:24:15,960
on Kanhaiya's pillow cover...

1065
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:19,029
...it matches with KhempaPs blood!

1066
01:24:19,623 --> 01:24:21,569
Great!
- They are sending a formal report.

1067
01:24:22,025 --> 01:24:23,629
Congrats indeed!

1068
01:24:27,431 --> 01:24:29,342
This is my boy!

1069
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:30,605
My Bond!
- Yes...

1070
01:24:32,169 --> 01:24:34,012
I'm your boy... You're happy Sir!

1071
01:24:34,071 --> 01:24:35,141
We'll miss you...

1072
01:24:36,173 --> 01:24:37,516
I'll miss you...

1073
01:24:39,476 --> 01:24:40,614
I'll just come...

1074
01:24:43,447 --> 01:24:45,120
So who's going to take over after you?

1075
01:24:45,916 --> 01:24:46,451
<i>J K!</i>

1076
01:24:52,189 --> 01:24:54,465
This guy will take over...

1077
01:24:54,524 --> 01:24:57,630
But he'll never overtake me.

1078
01:24:58,996 --> 01:24:59,440
Rama...

1079
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:01,704
you'll never change!

1080
01:25:02,265 --> 01:25:02,936
And you?

1081
01:25:04,034 --> 01:25:05,274
Will keep changing!

1082
01:25:05,335 --> 01:25:06,279
Like a chameleon!

1083
01:25:08,405 --> 01:25:09,611
Sometimes red...

1084
01:25:10,407 --> 01:25:11,579
sometimes yellow...

1085
01:25:11,641 --> 01:25:12,619
sometimes blue...

1086
01:25:14,311 --> 01:25:18,316
May I request the outgoing director
to come up here on stage.

1087
01:25:19,049 --> 01:25:22,394
Come on, let's make you green now.
-Green?

1088
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:26,101
The jealous green!

1089
01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:28,168
Excuse us.

1090
01:25:45,008 --> 01:25:47,989
My heart is heavy,

1091
01:25:50,247 --> 01:25:51,248
and simultaneously light too...

1092
01:25:52,682 --> 01:25:54,127
Heavy because...

1093
01:25:55,118 --> 01:25:57,189
...I can't be with you anymore...

1094
01:25:59,456 --> 01:26:00,230
Light

1095
01:26:01,058 --> 01:26:03,004
...because I don't need to
deal with you anymore...

1096
01:26:05,562 --> 01:26:06,472
No more!

1097
01:26:09,533 --> 01:26:11,206
For forty years...

1098
01:26:12,202 --> 01:26:13,078
I have...

1099
01:26:14,104 --> 01:26:15,674
...just one word to give you...

1100
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,446
Thank you!

1101
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:25,050
And for my good friend,

1102
01:26:25,582 --> 01:26:28,324
your new Director...

1103
01:26:29,219 --> 01:26:31,563
a Pafflng gift!

1104
01:26:33,356 --> 01:26:34,562
Ladies and gentlemen...

1105
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:37,263
During the tenure of yours truly...

1106
01:26:38,195 --> 01:26:40,368
the double murder case...

1107
01:26:41,331 --> 01:26:42,503
...has been solved!

1108
01:26:49,673 --> 01:26:50,617
Well done!

1109
01:26:56,379 --> 01:26:58,484
Hit her hard with the Khukri.

1110
01:27:02,652 --> 01:27:04,154
Khempal called the cops?

1111
01:27:05,055 --> 01:27:10,505
We killed him before
he had the chance.

1112
01:27:11,628 --> 01:27:13,574
L-low did you Kill Khempal'?

1113
01:27:16,233 --> 01:27:17,678
With the Khukri.

1114
01:27:28,979 --> 01:27:29,650
Well...

1115
01:27:30,981 --> 01:27:32,392
This is all very good, Ashwin.

1116
01:27:32,682 --> 01:27:33,285
- Congrats! -

1117
01:27:33,416 --> 01:27:34,121
Thank you Sir.

1118
01:27:35,285 --> 01:27:37,060
What is the main evidence
on the chargesheet?

1119
01:27:37,254 --> 01:27:37,959
We recovered...

1120
01:27:38,288 --> 01:27:38,732
Sir...

1121
01:27:40,023 --> 01:27:40,524
Sorry.

1122
01:27:41,057 --> 01:27:43,196
The blood found on
Kanhaiya's pillow cover...

1123
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:45,262
...matches KhempaPs blood.

1124
01:27:50,567 --> 01:27:54,037
So if this is our main evidence...

1125
01:27:55,338 --> 01:27:56,373
...don't you think we should get this

1126
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:57,679
reconfirmed by the lab?

1127
01:27:59,142 --> 01:28:00,018
Why sir?

1128
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:04,256
Narco tests are not admissible in court

1129
01:28:04,314 --> 01:28:05,520
and I want to be
doubly sure about this.

1130
01:28:07,217 --> 01:28:10,061
Vedant, take the first flight
to Ahmedabad,

1131
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,656
and submit the reconfirmation

1132
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:12,756
of the report by evening.

1133
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:14,134
You understand?

1134
01:28:20,363 --> 01:28:20,966
Ashwin...

1135
01:28:21,631 --> 01:28:22,166
Yes Sir...

1136
01:28:22,599 --> 01:28:24,601
You can file the chargesheet
day after tomorrow.

1137
01:28:25,135 --> 01:28:26,113
- Happy'? -
Thank you Sir.

1138
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:30,947
Sir...

1139
01:28:31,408 --> 01:28:33,012
Sir... tomorrow is my
fiancee's birthday...

1140
01:28:33,076 --> 01:28:34,111
Take her with you.

1141
01:28:34,544 --> 01:28:35,488
Sir tomorrow we...

1142
01:28:36,046 --> 01:28:37,992
When is your promotion due?

1143
01:28:38,582 --> 01:28:39,424
Still time for that...

1144
01:28:40,684 --> 01:28:42,595
There's never enough time, Vedant.

1145
01:28:42,652 --> 01:28:43,357
All the best!

1146
01:28:48,992 --> 01:28:51,336
On the recommendation of
Central Department of Investigation

1147
01:28:52,996 --> 01:28:56,000
this court grants bail
to Dr. Ramesh Tandon

1148
01:28:56,066 --> 01:28:57,443
with the following
terms and conditions:

1149
01:28:59,035 --> 01:29:01,379
The applicant is to furnish
a bond of Rs. 5 lakhs

1150
01:29:02,472 --> 01:29:04,247
and securities of a similar amount.

1151
01:29:08,411 --> 01:29:09,389
Yes Sir...

1152
01:29:10,614 --> 01:29:11,592
Ashvvin listen to this...

1153
01:29:13,016 --> 01:29:13,756
Yes Vedant, carry on...

1154
01:29:14,017 --> 01:29:15,291
Sir I don't know how these idiots

1155
01:29:15,352 --> 01:29:16,524
could make such a huge mistake!

1156
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,490
- They say there's some
typographical error... -

1157
01:29:19,389 --> 01:29:20,367
What typographical error?

1158
01:29:20,957 --> 01:29:21,958
Forensics collected pillow covers

1159
01:29:22,259 --> 01:29:24,705
from Khempal and Kanhaiya's rooms.

1160
01:29:24,961 --> 01:29:25,439
- Right? -

1161
01:29:25,929 --> 01:29:26,270
Right...

1162
01:29:26,596 --> 01:29:29,042
They named KhempaPs cover as Z-25

1163
01:29:29,266 --> 01:29:31,405
...and Kanhaiya's as X-52.

1164
01:29:31,668 --> 01:29:33,170
Now they're saying

1165
01:29:33,236 --> 01:29:34,943
they've typed Z-25 as X-52

1166
01:29:35,005 --> 01:29:35,949
in the report by mistake.

1167
01:29:36,206 --> 01:29:37,241
It's a typographical error.

1168
01:29:37,674 --> 01:29:38,948
Which now means that

1169
01:29:39,009 --> 01:29:40,079
the pillow cover with KhempaPs blood

1170
01:29:40,143 --> 01:29:41,315
was found in KhempaPs room

1171
01:29:41,378 --> 01:29:42,618
and not Kanhaiyds?

1172
01:29:42,679 --> 01:29:43,214
Is that it?

1173
01:29:43,313 --> 01:29:44,519
That's exactly what they're saying Sir!

1174
01:29:44,681 --> 01:29:45,523
L-low can they say that'?

1175
01:29:45,615 --> 01:29:48,095
I collected the bloodied
pillow cover myself

1176
01:29:48,151 --> 01:29:49,186
from Kanhaiya's room!

1177
01:29:49,252 --> 01:29:50,196
How's that possible?

1178
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:51,564
And how can anyone

1179
01:29:51,621 --> 01:29:53,430
mistakenly type Z-25 as X-52

1180
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:54,628
ten different times
in the same report?

1181
01:29:55,191 --> 01:29:56,465
I've been trying to tell them

1182
01:29:56,526 --> 01:29:58,631
the same thing for hours.

1183
01:29:58,695 --> 01:29:59,730
But they are adamant!

1184
01:30:00,130 --> 01:30:01,040
Who's in charge there?

1185
01:30:01,131 --> 01:30:01,700
Put me through to him...

1186
01:30:01,998 --> 01:30:02,703
<i>I'll Kill that b******!</i>

1187
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,177
I will handle this officially don't worry.

1188
01:30:05,468 --> 01:30:06,412
No no Sir... Let me...

1189
01:30:06,503 --> 01:30:08,278
Vedant, scan and mail me
those reports immediately!

1190
01:30:08,605 --> 01:30:09,345
Hello... Listen...

1191
01:30:09,706 --> 01:30:11,208
I will go myself... to Ahmedabad.

1192
01:30:11,274 --> 01:30:12,548
No no... you don't have to go...

1193
01:30:12,609 --> 01:30:13,417
I will handle it...

1194
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:14,420
And trust me...

1195
01:30:17,013 --> 01:30:18,219
But how is that possible'?

1196
01:30:27,324 --> 01:30:29,600
<i>Are the Memos done'?
- Yes</i>

1197
01:30:30,126 --> 01:30:31,605
Turn off the gas.

1198
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:36,467
Bhabhakaun... Hey Bhabhakaun!

1199
01:30:37,434 --> 01:30:38,538
Bhabhakaun!

1200
01:30:39,369 --> 01:30:40,473
Bhabhakaun!

1201
01:30:41,705 --> 01:30:43,582
Where has this Bhabhakaun gone?

1202
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:45,984
What did you just say?
What is this Bhabhakaun?

1203
01:30:46,042 --> 01:30:49,182
In Nepalese, stutterers
are called Bhabhakaun.

1204
01:30:49,245 --> 01:30:50,246
Where is Bhabhakaun?

1205
01:30:50,313 --> 01:30:51,291
- Here he is. -

1206
01:30:51,448 --> 01:30:52,290
- Where were you? -

1207
01:30:52,982 --> 01:30:54,154
I had g.. gone to the b.. bathroom.

1208
01:31:06,629 --> 01:31:07,607
Who is it?

1209
01:31:17,607 --> 01:31:18,585
What were you doing?

1210
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:23,490
S..s...sleeping...

1211
01:31:24,347 --> 01:31:26,588
BhaK. bhak.. bhakaun?

1212
01:32:05,355 --> 01:32:06,698
Why did I hit you?

1213
01:32:10,627 --> 01:32:11,571
I... I don't know...

1214
01:32:11,961 --> 01:32:14,635
You'll speak the truth, yes?

1215
01:32:16,166 --> 01:32:17,668
Yes Sir...

1216
01:32:18,968 --> 01:32:20,072
The truth...

1217
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:21,314
Yes...

1218
01:32:21,938 --> 01:32:24,077
You'll testify in court?

1219
01:32:28,178 --> 01:32:30,180
Will they hang me?

1220
01:32:32,015 --> 01:32:33,016
No, they will probably let you go...

1221
01:32:33,917 --> 01:32:35,191
...if you tell them the truth.

1222
01:32:36,352 --> 01:32:37,023
Alright?

1223
01:32:38,421 --> 01:32:40,230
Y.. yes Sir...

1224
01:32:41,991 --> 01:32:43,095
Shoot him!

1225
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:47,664
No.. no Sir please don't shoot me!

1226
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,413
We'll shoot you with a camera, is that okay?

1227
01:32:58,475 --> 01:33:00,318
Y.. yes sir...

1228
01:33:05,482 --> 01:33:06,426
Sir...

1229
01:33:09,419 --> 01:33:16,359
I... I slept early that night...

1230
01:33:20,930 --> 01:33:22,409
Khempal came to wake me up...

1231
01:33:22,899 --> 01:33:25,072
Nandu wake up! Wake up!

1232
01:33:27,504 --> 01:33:28,676
What the hell have you guys done?

1233
01:33:29,639 --> 01:33:31,516
Nothing's happened!

1234
01:33:31,574 --> 01:33:33,383
Don't worry... look!

1235
01:33:36,179 --> 01:33:37,157
She's breathing...

1236
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:38,925
she's still breathing...

1237
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:42,487
She's just unconscious...

1238
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:45,327
Listen to me!

1239
01:33:45,588 --> 01:33:48,228
When I reached there...

1240
01:33:49,259 --> 01:33:50,567
Bhakbhakaun!

1241
01:33:51,094 --> 01:33:56,703
By.. by then they had killed Sh... Shruti...

1242
01:33:58,368 --> 01:33:59,312
<i>- They who'? -</i>

1243
01:34:04,207 --> 01:34:06,414
K..k.. Kanhaiya and Rajpal.

1244
01:34:07,577 --> 01:34:09,614
You'll testify in court of your own will?

1245
01:34:15,318 --> 01:34:16,228
Yes Sir...

1246
01:34:21,324 --> 01:34:22,632
You think I'm a fool?

1247
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:24,604
What? ... Sorry?

1248
01:34:25,662 --> 01:34:27,232
First you beat up
and torture somebody,

1249
01:34:27,297 --> 01:34:29,004
then force him to
become an approver?!

1250
01:34:29,198 --> 01:34:30,609
Sir he's ready to testify in
the magistrates presence!

1251
01:34:30,667 --> 01:34:32,203
Then we chargesheet
and the case is over!

1252
01:34:32,268 --> 01:34:34,111
I don't know how Rama
used to run things...

1253
01:34:34,337 --> 01:34:35,543
...but this will not
happen in my command!

1254
01:34:35,972 --> 01:34:37,315
Sir he's willing to testify on his own!

1255
01:34:37,373 --> 01:34:38,943
You guys have turned this into a joke!

1256
01:34:40,109 --> 01:34:42,521
With great difficulty this agency
has built a reputation!

1257
01:34:42,579 --> 01:34:43,683
I won't let it go to dogs!

1258
01:34:45,348 --> 01:34:46,452
I will not tolerate this anymore!

1259
01:34:46,516 --> 01:34:47,392
Look at this!

1260
01:34:49,619 --> 01:34:50,996
- Look at this!
What is this'?

1261
01:34:51,054 --> 01:34:52,158
Look at it!

1262
01:35:01,331 --> 01:35:03,504
You're off this case with immediate effect!

1263
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:04,337
Sir...

1264
01:35:04,934 --> 01:35:05,503
Enough!

1265
01:35:05,602 --> 01:35:06,444
I don't want any more words.

1266
01:35:06,502 --> 01:35:07,071
This is..

1267
01:35:07,236 --> 01:35:08,078
Finished!

1268
01:35:11,407 --> 01:35:12,477
Traitor!

1269
01:35:14,243 --> 01:35:15,187
Ashwin!

1270
01:35:19,315 --> 01:35:20,658
You can't do this Ashwin!

1271
01:35:20,917 --> 01:35:22,362
Vinod! Come in!

1272
01:35:25,555 --> 01:35:27,364
Take him away!

1273
01:35:29,626 --> 01:35:30,627
Take this psycho away!

1274
01:35:31,461 --> 01:35:34,999
This is wrong!
- Get out!

1275
01:35:36,366 --> 01:35:37,674
You're suspended! Get out!

1276
01:36:35,558 --> 01:36:36,593
Who is it Vaishali?

1277
01:36:59,315 --> 01:37:01,420
I can't do it...

1278
01:37:02,251 --> 01:37:03,195
What?

1279
01:37:04,454 --> 01:37:06,127
I can't do it anymore...

1280
01:37:09,559 --> 01:37:10,594
Do what?

1281
01:37:11,327 --> 01:37:12,965
I just can't.

1282
01:37:20,203 --> 01:37:22,706
Please don't let me go...

1283
01:37:23,406 --> 01:37:24,350
Please...

1284
01:37:24,507 --> 01:37:25,451
- Where? -

1285
01:37:26,609 --> 01:37:28,179
I can't go back to my job!

1286
01:37:43,326 --> 01:37:46,967
The CDI has failed to file
a chargesheet within 9O days.

1287
01:37:47,063 --> 01:37:49,100
And the court has released the accused

1288
01:37:49,165 --> 01:37:51,509
in the Shruti murder case, on bail.

1289
01:37:51,701 --> 01:37:54,181
Sources say the CDI will now start

1290
01:37:54,237 --> 01:37:56,513
a new investigation with a new team.

1291
01:38:05,581 --> 01:38:09,222
I'm sure all of you have
heard a lot of stories

1292
01:38:09,285 --> 01:38:11,231
about the Shruti murder case

1293
01:38:11,287 --> 01:38:12,265
as well as Ashvvin Kumar.

1294
01:38:13,189 --> 01:38:18,002
So it's important that
all doubts be cleared.

1295
01:38:21,063 --> 01:38:25,671
I think... he got too emotionally
involved with the case.

1296
01:38:26,502 --> 01:38:28,948
The way doctors remain

1297
01:38:29,005 --> 01:38:31,485
emotionally detached from their patients...

1298
01:38:32,141 --> 01:38:35,987
We too, need to keep
some emotional distance

1299
01:38:36,045 --> 01:38:40,016
from our cases and subjects.

1300
01:38:41,150 --> 01:38:42,128
So I request all of you...

1301
01:38:43,186 --> 01:38:47,601
please... do not, like Ashvvin

1302
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:49,330
...let your personal lives

1303
01:38:49,392 --> 01:38:51,702
get in the way
of your investigation.

1304
01:38:53,095 --> 01:38:54,039
Any questions?

1305
01:38:56,065 --> 01:38:58,204
Good, so let's get
back to work gentlemen.

1306
01:38:58,668 --> 01:38:59,578
Thank you.

1307
01:39:01,571 --> 01:39:03,175
Sir, a small request
- Yes?

1308
01:39:04,574 --> 01:39:07,054
Could we assign an
investigative officer to the case?

1309
01:39:07,243 --> 01:39:07,550
Why?

1310
01:39:08,611 --> 01:39:10,318
Sir, I've been involved with the case

1311
01:39:10,413 --> 01:39:11,619
along with Ashvvin from the beginning...

1312
01:39:12,415 --> 01:39:13,393
No matter how hard I try...

1313
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:15,996
I won't get an objective
perspective on the case...

1314
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:17,961
It would be better if...

1315
01:39:18,221 --> 01:39:19,996
an investigative office works on the case...

1316
01:39:20,423 --> 01:39:21,959
...and I observe from a distance.

1317
01:39:22,692 --> 01:39:24,000
Do you have anybody in mind?

1318
01:39:25,094 --> 01:39:26,129
Ivlanohar or Bhattacharya?

1319
01:39:29,632 --> 01:39:30,975
No, they have their hands full...

1320
01:39:32,969 --> 01:39:33,504
Paul Sir?

1321
01:39:38,407 --> 01:39:39,943
L-low long will you hide'?

1322
01:39:42,445 --> 01:39:44,083
L-low far will you run'?

1323
01:39:45,348 --> 01:39:47,487
I've caught most wanted criminals...

1324
01:39:47,984 --> 01:39:49,327
You too cannot escape!

1325
01:39:51,988 --> 01:39:53,296
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

1326
01:39:56,292 --> 01:39:56,736
What's this?

1327
01:39:58,227 --> 01:39:58,728
He's become invisible!

1328
01:39:59,996 --> 01:40:00,440
You scoundrel!

1329
01:40:01,364 --> 01:40:02,138
Come out, rogue!

1330
01:40:03,332 --> 01:40:06,745
Give yourself up while you still can!

1331
01:40:09,272 --> 01:40:09,716
Hello? ..

1332
01:40:10,706 --> 01:40:11,480
- Good evening, Sir... -

1333
01:40:13,042 --> 01:40:14,578
Sir, I'm on leave for two months...

1334
01:40:15,745 --> 01:40:17,691
The wife has gone to her parents...

1335
01:40:18,547 --> 01:40:19,116
Yes...

1336
01:40:19,148 --> 01:40:19,649
Gotcha!

1337
01:40:23,085 --> 01:40:25,463
I'll just need a couple of days
to go through the files...

1338
01:40:26,155 --> 01:40:29,329
It's an honor that you have
considered me for this case Sir!

1339
01:40:30,593 --> 01:40:31,503
What about Kuku?

1340
01:40:33,629 --> 01:40:35,006
He'll be with me...

1341
01:40:36,432 --> 01:40:38,036
...but there's no problem Sir...

1342
01:40:39,335 --> 01:40:41,110
A kid hanging around

1343
01:40:41,203 --> 01:40:42,147
a murder investigation Mr Paul'?

1344
01:40:44,206 --> 01:40:48,552
Sir, there's no one to take care
of him after school...

1345
01:40:49,412 --> 01:40:51,358
The Department can arrange
a babysitter for you...

1346
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:53,355
No, it's not that...

1347
01:40:54,650 --> 01:40:57,529
The thing is, he is not an
easily manageable child...

1348
01:40:58,654 --> 01:41:00,361
...and actually, he is not even a child...

1349
01:41:00,623 --> 01:41:01,499
Not a child?

1350
01:41:04,493 --> 01:41:06,268
He's a demon!

1351
01:41:09,598 --> 01:41:10,440
Sir...

1352
01:41:12,268 --> 01:41:13,144
Sir, I need a demon...

1353
01:41:13,703 --> 01:41:14,681
...I mean a prosecutor...

1354
01:41:15,137 --> 01:41:16,343
...in the team from the beginning.

1355
01:41:17,073 --> 01:41:18,575
Prosecutor? Why?

1356
01:41:19,241 --> 01:41:21,243
To minutely verify all evidence

1357
01:41:21,344 --> 01:41:22,618
is very imperative.

1358
01:41:23,245 --> 01:41:23,985
Everyday.

1359
01:41:25,381 --> 01:41:27,418
Mr. Sanga! We're together again!

1360
01:41:28,451 --> 01:41:30,362
We don't want to repeat Ashwin's mistakes...

1361
01:41:32,021 --> 01:41:35,025
No matter how diligently we
investigate the case...

1362
01:41:35,157 --> 01:41:37,137
...ultimately, it is the prosecutor

1363
01:41:37,226 --> 01:41:38,330
who has to prove it
and win a conviction.

1364
01:41:40,196 --> 01:41:41,675
Evidence and conviction

1365
01:41:42,298 --> 01:41:43,436
are like mother and infant.

1366
01:41:45,167 --> 01:41:47,113
A healthy mother ensures
a healthy infant.

1367
01:41:55,511 --> 01:42:00,585
You made a statement that Rajpal
was with you till 12:30 at night?

1368
01:42:02,451 --> 01:42:05,159
Yes. I was returning from Dehradun...

1369
01:42:05,287 --> 01:42:08,359
...Mr Nathani and Rajpal
picked me up from the station.

1370
01:42:09,258 --> 01:42:10,362
I was fasting that day...

1371
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:13,165
...so I had dinner at 12:00

1372
01:42:13,262 --> 01:42:16,243
and went to bed at around 12:30 am.

1373
01:42:18,501 --> 01:42:22,210
L-low long does it take to reach
Dr.Tandon's house from here'?

1374
01:42:24,473 --> 01:42:26,009
4O minutes at the most.

1375
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:28,420
On foot?

1376
01:42:29,078 --> 01:42:29,988
Yes.

1377
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:31,990
And by cycle?

1378
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:35,194
2O minutes.

1379
01:42:36,419 --> 01:42:37,329
Q Kay-

1380
01:42:39,255 --> 01:42:40,461
I'm telling the truth Sir...

1381
01:42:41,123 --> 01:42:44,366
...that day Kanhaiya came
straight home from work.

1382
01:42:45,227 --> 01:42:48,037
Six of us sleep here...

1383
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:51,043
so if he had gone out
and come in,

1384
01:42:51,133 --> 01:42:53,079
someone would have woken up.

1385
01:42:54,303 --> 01:42:55,213
Q Kay-

1386
01:42:57,039 --> 01:42:58,950
Are you for real?

1387
01:42:59,341 --> 01:43:03,016
I saw alcohol bottles
in KhempaPs room.

1388
01:43:04,013 --> 01:43:05,014
And the cot was depressed?

1389
01:43:05,347 --> 01:43:06,485
Yes.

1390
01:43:07,316 --> 01:43:08,693
And you?
- What?

1391
01:43:09,585 --> 01:43:11,428
L-low much pressure did you face'?

1392
01:43:12,988 --> 01:43:15,696
2 lakhs? 5 lakhs?

1393
01:43:16,158 --> 01:43:17,068
Kanhaiya!

1394
01:43:17,593 --> 01:43:18,367
Kanhaiya!

1395
01:43:18,928 --> 01:43:23,274
Did you kill her with a Khukri?

1396
01:43:24,533 --> 01:43:26,638
Was he saying this or
were you making him say it?

1397
01:43:27,336 --> 01:43:30,476
Mind your tongue IVIrPaul!

1398
01:43:30,673 --> 01:43:33,449
You're talking to a
retired police officer!

1399
01:43:34,076 --> 01:43:36,522
When we get a lead we have to prod...

1400
01:43:36,612 --> 01:43:38,023
There's nothing wrong in this!

1401
01:43:39,081 --> 01:43:40,992
It's not wrong, it's completely wrong!

1402
01:43:41,283 --> 01:43:42,227
And unethical!

1403
01:43:42,551 --> 01:43:45,464
Need permission to conduct
Narco test on the parents Sir.

1404
01:43:48,591 --> 01:43:50,434
Ramesh, did you enter
ShrutFs room at night?

1405
01:43:51,393 --> 01:43:54,272
Did you tidy up the
sheets after the murder?

1406
01:43:54,930 --> 01:43:56,500
L-low did you Kill Shruti, Ramesh'?

1407
01:43:57,399 --> 01:43:59,310
Did you clean the room afterwards?

1408
01:43:59,602 --> 01:44:04,517
Sources say the CDI
has been left red-faced.

1409
01:44:05,174 --> 01:44:07,347
As per the Narco tests

1410
01:44:07,610 --> 01:44:09,214
the CDI has found no evidence

1411
01:44:09,411 --> 01:44:12,119
<i>that connects the Tandems
to Shrufis murder.</i>

1412
01:44:13,015 --> 01:44:16,224
Both the husband and wife
are clever Scoundrels!

1413
01:44:16,952 --> 01:44:19,159
They must've taken some
antidote before the Narco tests...

1414
01:44:20,156 --> 01:44:22,636
No wonder the Narco drugs
didn't work on them.

1415
01:44:25,928 --> 01:44:27,100
Are there antidotes
for Narco tests?

1416
01:44:28,063 --> 01:44:30,373
There aren't. But there could be...

1417
01:44:31,467 --> 01:44:34,038
Don't forget... they're both Doctors!

1418
01:44:35,938 --> 01:44:37,508
The ones testing them
are also Doctors, Mr Paul...

1419
01:44:38,307 --> 01:44:39,479
I'm sure they were put through

1420
01:44:39,575 --> 01:44:41,521
blood tests before the Narco.

1421
01:44:43,312 --> 01:44:44,382
It could also be possible that

1422
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,187
they didn't commit the murders after all?

1423
01:44:49,118 --> 01:44:52,031
Look at their faces... their eyes...

1424
01:44:52,121 --> 01:44:54,067
Don't they look like murderers?

1425
01:45:16,312 --> 01:45:18,519
But there are two of them in the photo.

1426
01:45:19,615 --> 01:45:21,253
It's been one and a half years...

1427
01:45:23,919 --> 01:45:24,897
I have no idea where it could be.

1428
01:45:26,488 --> 01:45:29,560
The girl's forehead wound
is 4><3 centimeters.

1429
01:45:31,493 --> 01:45:33,530
And how big is this'?

1430
01:45:40,169 --> 01:45:41,443
Khempal was hit on the back of the head...

1431
01:45:42,004 --> 01:45:43,074
...and the girl on the forehead?

1432
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:49,448
God is great!

1433
01:45:51,113 --> 01:45:53,024
And holy are the
messengers of his faith!

1434
01:45:55,551 --> 01:45:56,461
Missionary.

1435
01:45:57,386 --> 01:45:58,990
What the hell are you making me do?

1436
01:46:58,981 --> 01:47:02,155
You are bargaining like
you're out to buy vegetables...

1437
01:47:02,251 --> 01:47:03,355
- No Gogia Sir... Nothing like that. -

1438
01:47:03,452 --> 01:47:05,193
This is not how bussiness is done...

1439
01:47:05,287 --> 01:47:07,198
- Please see what you can do.
This will be very difficult for me. -

1440
01:47:07,289 --> 01:47:09,394
This is what it is... Now you decide.

1441
01:47:38,554 --> 01:47:39,726
Thank you.

1442
01:48:02,378 --> 01:48:03,516
In some cases...

1443
01:48:04,146 --> 01:48:08,060
the process of intelligence gathering
has to trample law...

1444
01:48:09,651 --> 01:48:12,996
...in order to achieve effective results.

1445
01:48:14,456 --> 01:48:18,302
That's why some experts
define information gathering...

1446
01:48:19,428 --> 01:48:21,965
...as a legal act carried out illegally.

1447
01:48:27,603 --> 01:48:29,048
Somewhere we have to
find a balance between...

1448
01:48:32,007 --> 01:48:33,418
...what the system wants you to do...

1449
01:48:35,377 --> 01:48:38,221
...and what you feel is
right as an individual.

1450
01:48:43,318 --> 01:48:43,989
Thank you.

1451
01:48:50,025 --> 01:48:52,027
Time for the Q and A.

1452
01:48:52,127 --> 01:48:54,573
If anyone has any questions
for Mr Kumar please proceed.

1453
01:48:56,298 --> 01:48:57,208
Yeah, Sandeep...

1454
01:48:59,201 --> 01:49:00,145
Sir, I was wondering...

1455
01:49:01,036 --> 01:49:03,607
...since you're such an accomplished
officer of your agency...

1456
01:49:04,206 --> 01:49:06,208
Why did you take premature retirement?

1457
01:49:07,643 --> 01:49:08,519
What made you quit?

1458
01:49:10,679 --> 01:49:12,215
I guess I couldn't find the balance.

1459
01:49:15,150 --> 01:49:16,629
Call me if any one
of you guys find it.

1460
01:49:17,686 --> 01:49:18,221
Please...

1461
01:49:19,321 --> 01:49:20,629
- Thank you Sir. -

1462
01:49:26,395 --> 01:49:28,068
Sir, are you sure
you dialed the right number?

1463
01:49:30,165 --> 01:49:31,166
Ashwin, how are you'?

1464
01:49:31,667 --> 01:49:32,270
<i>All well...</i>

1465
01:49:33,669 --> 01:49:36,673
The meeting I spoke to you about earlier...
- Yes... -

1466
01:49:36,972 --> 01:49:38,349
It's at 11 :00 am tomorrow.

1467
01:49:41,343 --> 01:49:45,723
Many of your fans will be present...

1468
01:49:47,483 --> 01:49:49,121
- Alright?
- Okay

1469
01:49:52,688 --> 01:49:55,567
I've read the reports
from both teams, in detail...

1470
01:49:56,525 --> 01:49:58,698
Both the conclusions are as different

1471
01:49:58,961 --> 01:50:00,565
as warring political parties!

1472
01:50:03,232 --> 01:50:05,508
One team says the
servants are the killers,

1473
01:50:05,567 --> 01:50:08,173
and the other says the parents did it.

1474
01:50:08,570 --> 01:50:10,516
Now the ministry has
to take some stand...

1475
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:12,250
- It's high time! -

1476
01:50:12,674 --> 01:50:14,517
Either you convince each other...

1477
01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:15,750
- Or convince me.-

1478
01:50:17,145 --> 01:50:18,089
Ashwin?

1479
01:50:22,050 --> 01:50:24,030
Sir, every investigation
follows a prime rule -

1480
01:50:24,286 --> 01:50:25,993
Inquiry, evidence and conclusion...

1481
01:50:26,188 --> 01:50:27,360
You enquire for evidence

1482
01:50:28,023 --> 01:50:29,093
and you come to a conclusion.

1483
01:50:30,526 --> 01:50:32,130
Here everything has backtracked...

1484
01:50:32,494 --> 01:50:33,973
These people first decided

1485
01:50:34,029 --> 01:50:35,133
on the conclusion...

1486
01:50:35,197 --> 01:50:36,175
then dug very hard for evidence.

1487
01:50:36,565 --> 01:50:38,067
You worked hard as well Sir...

1488
01:50:40,702 --> 01:50:42,181
...to get the poor, innocent servants

1489
01:50:42,237 --> 01:50:43,375
hung to their deaths.

1490
01:50:43,639 --> 01:50:45,175
If they are innocent, what are you?

1491
01:50:46,708 --> 01:50:47,652
There were four people in the house.

1492
01:50:48,443 --> 01:50:49,547
Two are alive and two dead.

1493
01:50:50,078 --> 01:50:50,579
- As simple as that. -

1494
01:50:51,213 --> 01:50:52,988
Everyone's testimony has changed!

1495
01:50:53,181 --> 01:50:55,320
The maid servant,the forensic
expert, the postmortem doctor!

1496
01:50:55,951 --> 01:50:58,022
So is it as simple as that?

1497
01:50:58,253 --> 01:50:59,197
Yes it is!

1498
01:50:59,321 --> 01:51:01,130
It happened!
- l-low is it possible'? -

1499
01:51:01,290 --> 01:51:02,268
Guys... Please!

1500
01:51:03,725 --> 01:51:05,068
Let's do one thing...

1501
01:51:05,661 --> 01:51:07,140
The second team can present

1502
01:51:07,195 --> 01:51:08,970
whatever new crucial
evidence or testimonies

1503
01:51:09,031 --> 01:51:10,738
- they have discovered... -

1504
01:51:12,467 --> 01:51:14,242
The first team can
examine the credentials.

1505
01:51:14,570 --> 01:51:15,514
- Fair? -

1506
01:51:16,138 --> 01:51:17,048
Fair enough.

1507
01:51:17,205 --> 01:51:17,546
Mr Paul...

1508
01:51:18,206 --> 01:51:19,014
Sir...

1509
01:51:19,908 --> 01:51:21,182
The biggest issue in this case is whether

1510
01:51:21,977 --> 01:51:24,355
there was anyone else at home that night...

1511
01:51:25,213 --> 01:51:27,090
- The first team says the killer
came from outside, -

1512
01:51:27,149 --> 01:51:29,493
killed Shruti, latched the door and ran.

1513
01:51:29,551 --> 01:51:30,325
Right?

1514
01:51:32,955 --> 01:51:33,660
Wrong.

1515
01:51:36,959 --> 01:51:38,597
The first person to arrive
at the crime scene...

1516
01:51:39,194 --> 01:51:42,038
if I may call her the prime witness...

1517
01:51:44,433 --> 01:51:46,174
The maid servant, Basanti...

1518
01:51:46,535 --> 01:51:48,481
<i>- After both the murders,
the Tandems -</i>

1519
01:51:48,537 --> 01:51:51,074
had been waiting for her to come.

1520
01:51:51,273 --> 01:51:53,617
- Basanti came, rang the bell, -

1521
01:51:54,209 --> 01:51:55,051
- the door was closed... -

1522
01:51:55,377 --> 01:51:58,358
Then the key is thrown from the balcony...

1523
01:51:59,281 --> 01:52:02,228
I'd like you to look at this door...

1524
01:52:03,552 --> 01:52:05,395
- This door is between
the two front doors, -

1525
01:52:06,121 --> 01:52:07,964
and it opens into KhempaPs room.

1526
01:52:11,326 --> 01:52:13,567
Normally, there is a fridge
placed against this door...

1527
01:52:14,329 --> 01:52:15,399
But that morning

1528
01:52:15,464 --> 01:52:17,137
the Tandons had moved the fridge

1529
01:52:17,199 --> 01:52:19,338
to be able to open the door.

1530
01:52:23,238 --> 01:52:26,117
When Basanti turned to the
stairs to get the key...

1531
01:52:28,076 --> 01:52:29,680
Mrs Tandon came out
of this very door,

1532
01:52:29,945 --> 01:52:31,982
opened the main door,

1533
01:52:32,447 --> 01:52:34,222
- and went back to throw the key. -

1534
01:52:34,616 --> 01:52:37,119
When Basanti came back up,

1535
01:52:37,185 --> 01:52:38,493
the main door didn't need a key...

1536
01:52:38,553 --> 01:52:39,463
...it opened with just a push.

1537
01:52:40,255 --> 01:52:42,428
The front door was
latched from outside,

1538
01:52:42,491 --> 01:52:44,266
just to show that
someone had broken in,

1539
01:52:44,326 --> 01:52:45,566
killed and run away...

1540
01:52:46,361 --> 01:52:48,568
What followed was the
Tandons acting all shocked...

1541
01:52:49,631 --> 01:52:51,668
When Basanti first came,
did she push

1542
01:52:51,933 --> 01:52:53,378
the main door to check
if it was unlocked?

1543
01:52:54,336 --> 01:52:55,280
Yes she did.

1544
01:52:55,671 --> 01:52:57,446
Her statement doesn't say so.

1545
01:52:58,140 --> 01:53:00,086
No problem, we can take
her statement again.

1546
01:53:00,542 --> 01:53:01,520
By blackmailing her like Gogia?

1547
01:53:02,244 --> 01:53:03,985
Oh come on Ashwin!

1548
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:07,354
We don't torture people
to make them approvers...

1549
01:53:08,216 --> 01:53:10,162
Sir, do you understand what
these people are trying to say?

1550
01:53:12,254 --> 01:53:13,198
Just imagine...

1551
01:53:14,256 --> 01:53:16,395
...I'll throw you the keys.

1552
01:53:18,093 --> 01:53:19,629
The moment Basanti
turns to get the key,

1553
01:53:21,129 --> 01:53:22,904
Nutan runs inside

1554
01:53:22,964 --> 01:53:24,966
and does everything that they are saying...

1555
01:53:41,049 --> 01:53:43,029
Put this back, I'll throw her the keys...

1556
01:54:06,374 --> 01:54:08,479
Quick, let's go! We have
to start crying now...

1557
01:54:43,345 --> 01:54:46,622
Look what, Khempal has done.

1558
01:54:51,086 --> 01:54:52,656
Such intricate planning!

1559
01:54:53,555 --> 01:54:55,592
Two murders, one dead
body on the terrace...

1560
01:54:56,424 --> 01:54:57,960
...dressing up the crime scene...

1561
01:54:58,593 --> 01:55:01,472
Moving the fridge, opening the
small door, latching the front door...

1562
01:55:01,630 --> 01:55:03,507
...throwing keys, moving
the fridge again...

1563
01:55:04,933 --> 01:55:05,434
All in a flash!

1564
01:55:06,234 --> 01:55:07,372
Are they Spiderman and Superwoman?

1565
01:55:07,702 --> 01:55:08,942
What are they?

1566
01:55:13,375 --> 01:55:14,581
And after all that planning,

1567
01:55:14,643 --> 01:55:18,489
the blood-stained whiskey
bottle on the table...

1568
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:20,058
...they didn't clear that up?

1569
01:55:21,383 --> 01:55:22,225
L-low come'?

1570
01:55:22,384 --> 01:55:24,125
Because they weren't professional killers.

1571
01:55:24,386 --> 01:55:26,127
Sir, it's simple...

1572
01:55:26,388 --> 01:55:29,494
...if a father sees his
daughter's dead body...

1573
01:55:30,258 --> 01:55:32,898
...will he cry standing outside
the room or run to hug her?

1574
01:55:33,094 --> 01:55:33,936
Has your daughter died?

1575
01:55:34,029 --> 01:55:35,201
Do you know what it
feels like to lose a child?

1576
01:55:35,964 --> 01:55:36,908
And you do?

1577
01:55:38,567 --> 01:55:40,069
To have a daughter,

1578
01:55:40,135 --> 01:55:42,479
you first need a wife...

1579
01:55:43,572 --> 01:55:44,915
You don't even have that.

1580
01:55:46,675 --> 01:55:49,087
We're talking about a
human reaction here...

1581
01:55:49,311 --> 01:55:50,585
That's exactly the point!

1582
01:55:51,313 --> 01:55:53,190
Human reactions can be different...

1583
01:55:53,515 --> 01:55:55,188
l-low can we generalize this'?

1584
01:55:55,951 --> 01:55:57,089
Sir, please note...

1585
01:55:59,321 --> 01:56:02,325
KhempaPs throat was slit completely...

1586
01:56:02,457 --> 01:56:04,130
...in a full circle.

1587
01:56:06,294 --> 01:56:07,637
The girl's was only half slit.

1588
01:56:09,164 --> 01:56:09,574
So?

1589
01:56:11,566 --> 01:56:13,341
Human reaction. She was their daughter...

1590
01:56:14,936 --> 01:56:16,176
Emotional attachment...

1591
01:56:18,306 --> 01:56:21,344
So while murdering his child
the doctor said...

1592
01:56:23,311 --> 01:56:26,383
'Sorry dear, I'm slitting your throat...'

1593
01:56:27,115 --> 01:56:28,423
'Hope you're not in pain?'

1594
01:56:29,150 --> 01:56:31,323
'Almost done...'

1595
01:56:31,653 --> 01:56:33,564
'Just this one vein
and you'll die!'

1596
01:56:35,090 --> 01:56:36,091
Let's be serious guys...

1597
01:56:41,463 --> 01:56:44,467
Sorry... but you're right,
their whole theory is a joke.

1598
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:46,545
The internet router switched on and off

1599
01:56:46,601 --> 01:56:48,171
three times that night...

1600
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:50,376
That means the parents were awake.

1601
01:56:51,039 --> 01:56:52,518
Next clay when all hell broke loose,

1602
01:56:52,574 --> 01:56:54,019
and no one used the computer...

1603
01:56:54,075 --> 01:56:55,383
...even then the router
switched on and off...

1604
01:56:56,511 --> 01:56:57,489
The router is made in India.

1605
01:56:57,545 --> 01:56:59,218
It turns on and off at its own will!

1606
01:56:59,481 --> 01:57:01,051
The computer was
actually used that day...

1607
01:57:01,216 --> 01:57:01,660
What for?

1608
01:57:02,150 --> 01:57:03,220
ShrutFs friends used it...

1609
01:57:03,685 --> 01:57:04,493
Why?

1610
01:57:08,023 --> 01:57:09,934
To clean up disreputable literature...

1611
01:57:10,091 --> 01:57:10,660
What?

1612
01:57:11,993 --> 01:57:13,199
Porn... Pornographic material...

1613
01:57:13,261 --> 01:57:14,069
- You don't know? -

1614
01:57:15,063 --> 01:57:16,474
Okay... Testimony?

1615
01:57:16,698 --> 01:57:18,075
Off the record.

1616
01:57:18,133 --> 01:57:18,611
Why?

1617
01:57:19,067 --> 01:57:21,479
What would people say about the girl?

1618
01:57:23,538 --> 01:57:24,676
Oh... Compassion!

1619
01:57:25,540 --> 01:57:30,011
So Mr Compassionate, what
was the motive for the murder?

1620
01:57:30,345 --> 01:57:31,483
Sudden rage.

1621
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:33,424
Why?

1622
01:57:33,515 --> 01:57:35,085
The doctor found his
daughter and his servant

1623
01:57:35,150 --> 01:57:37,357
in a Sacrilegious Disposition.

1624
01:57:37,552 --> 01:57:40,192
Then he lost his self control and...

1625
01:57:40,555 --> 01:57:42,057
Sacrilegious Disposition?

1626
01:57:42,590 --> 01:57:44,536
Missionary position.

1627
01:57:46,027 --> 01:57:47,404
- He then took the golf club and... -

1628
01:57:47,963 --> 01:57:50,500
first the servant, then the daughter...

1629
01:57:54,302 --> 01:57:55,576
The golf club was in the girl's room?

1630
01:57:56,037 --> 01:57:58,244
No, in the servant's room...

1631
01:58:01,042 --> 01:58:03,386
So the doctor found them in a sacre...

1632
01:58:03,445 --> 01:58:04,719
...sacremonious?

1633
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:05,685
Sacrilegious disposition?

1634
01:58:05,981 --> 01:58:07,255
Yes... in that disposition...

1635
01:58:08,249 --> 01:58:10,251
And he ran out of the room
to fetch his golf club...

1636
01:58:11,119 --> 01:58:13,565
And by the time he came back,
the servant and the girl...

1637
01:58:14,155 --> 01:58:15,657
...were still in the same position?

1638
01:58:16,091 --> 01:58:17,195
Sacrilegious disposition...

1639
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:20,397
Sir, be serious!
We are doing serious business...

1640
01:58:21,496 --> 01:58:22,600
Can we go on please?

1641
01:58:23,331 --> 01:58:24,969
He wants to memorize this word!

1642
01:58:25,133 --> 01:58:26,271
Sir, let's carry on please...

1643
01:58:26,334 --> 01:58:27,540
Carry on GUYS- --

1644
01:58:28,603 --> 01:58:29,547
Sacrilegious.

1645
01:58:30,305 --> 01:58:31,249
Paul Sir...

1646
01:58:32,307 --> 01:58:35,288
According to you, the girl's computer

1647
01:58:35,343 --> 01:58:36,549
was full of disreputable literature...

1648
01:58:37,612 --> 01:58:40,149
Porn.
- Yeah, now you know...

1649
01:58:41,316 --> 01:58:42,488
It was full of disreputable literature...

1650
01:58:42,650 --> 01:58:43,151
Yes

1651
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:45,595
And she had a boyfriend too...

1652
01:58:47,088 --> 01:58:48,362
Then why would she need to be in a

1653
01:58:48,423 --> 01:58:50,061
Sacrilegious Disposition with a
5O year old servant?

1654
01:58:50,492 --> 01:58:52,597
Not a need, but a revenge
against her parents...

1655
01:58:53,094 --> 01:58:54,038
Revenge for what?

1656
01:58:54,729 --> 01:58:57,437
She was aware of
her parents activities...

1657
01:58:58,199 --> 01:58:59,303
What activities?

1658
01:59:00,468 --> 01:59:01,538
Wife swapping.

1659
01:59:02,637 --> 01:59:04,173
That was the only way
she could retaliate

1660
01:59:04,239 --> 01:59:05,309
and hurt them

1661
01:59:05,373 --> 01:59:06,613
and have sex with the servant.

1662
01:59:08,376 --> 01:59:11,448
This was the angle used by
the first police investigation...

1663
01:59:11,646 --> 01:59:14,354
And the Chief...

1664
01:59:14,416 --> 01:59:16,657
who embarrassed the whole police department

1665
01:59:16,918 --> 01:59:19,091
in that press conference...

1666
01:59:19,621 --> 01:59:22,568
He was your batch-mate, right?

1667
01:59:23,158 --> 01:59:24,102
What do you mean?

1668
01:59:24,325 --> 01:59:24,996
Nothing...

1669
01:59:25,060 --> 01:59:25,629
Then why do you say it?

1670
01:59:26,361 --> 01:59:29,103
'The heart is familiar
with the world's ways...'

1671
01:59:29,164 --> 01:59:31,576
'True friends are always
handy to save face...'

1672
01:59:33,635 --> 01:59:35,945
Learn to lose gracefully at least...

1673
01:59:36,504 --> 01:59:37,448
Ashwin, come on!

1674
01:59:39,374 --> 01:59:41,581
When KhempaPs body was
found on the terrace...

1675
01:59:42,177 --> 01:59:44,123
...he was wearing his slippers.

1676
01:59:44,512 --> 01:59:47,049
So was he wearing his slippers

1677
01:59:47,115 --> 01:59:49,152
while in the Sacrilegious Disposition?

1678
01:59:53,688 --> 01:59:56,635
Or he was like 'Oh Doctor...
you caught me but don't kill me here...

1679
01:59:57,225 --> 01:59:59,637
...let's go to the terrace...
I'll just get my slippers...'

1680
02:00:01,396 --> 02:00:02,340
Anyway, Sir...

1681
02:00:03,565 --> 02:00:07,980
RajpaPs house is 2O minutes
away from the Tandon's house...

1682
02:00:08,369 --> 02:00:11,350
Not a single watchman saw
him entering or exiting the building.

1683
02:00:12,173 --> 02:00:15,518
Even if we accept your theory...

1684
02:00:16,044 --> 02:00:18,650
at 12:30 am, he was at NathanFs house...

1685
02:00:20,648 --> 02:00:21,592
We have the testimony.

1686
02:00:22,650 --> 02:00:27,065
<i>That means he reached the
Tendon house at 12:50 am.</i>

1687
02:00:27,555 --> 02:00:29,262
As per the post mortem,

1688
02:00:29,924 --> 02:00:31,699
the murder happened
between 12 and 1 at night...

1689
02:00:33,027 --> 02:00:35,507
The same doctor has given

1690
02:00:35,563 --> 02:00:37,099
the time of murder as 12 noon.

1691
02:00:37,165 --> 02:00:38,667
He was just confused...

1692
02:00:38,933 --> 02:00:39,707
When the girl was in school...

1693
02:00:40,201 --> 02:00:42,340
- l-le jumbled up the AM and PM... -

1694
02:00:42,403 --> 02:00:44,508
Screw his AM and PM!

1695
02:00:45,707 --> 02:00:48,051
His reports have changed
four times in three years!

1696
02:00:49,010 --> 02:00:52,480
Either the vaginal
swab is contaminated,

1697
02:00:52,547 --> 02:00:54,618
- or the finding is 'subjective... -

1698
02:00:55,016 --> 02:00:56,461
First they said the Khukri killed her,

1699
02:00:56,518 --> 02:00:58,191
now they say it's a surgical instrument.

1700
02:00:58,987 --> 02:01:00,364
In the Narco tests the servants gave

1701
02:01:00,421 --> 02:01:01,627
a detailed account of the murders...

1702
02:01:04,259 --> 02:01:05,738
You did a Narco test on the parents.

1703
02:01:05,994 --> 02:01:07,029
Did you find anything?

1704
02:01:07,729 --> 02:01:10,403
The first team's Narco
report is fabricated...

1705
02:01:10,598 --> 02:01:13,374
These are the CDs of
the original report...

1706
02:01:13,434 --> 02:01:14,504
You can have a look...

1707
02:01:16,437 --> 02:01:19,384
As per your Narco tests,

1708
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:21,477
the murderers destroyed KhempaPs

1709
02:01:21,543 --> 02:01:23,580
and ShrutFs cell phones.

1710
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:27,157
Six months later the girl's phone

1711
02:01:27,215 --> 02:01:28,660
turned up in UP. state.

1712
02:01:29,684 --> 02:01:31,163
My team has also recovered

1713
02:01:31,219 --> 02:01:32,960
the murder weapon - the Golf club.

1714
02:01:33,421 --> 02:01:34,365
Recovered?
- Yes

1715
02:01:34,689 --> 02:01:36,032
Mr Tandon found it in his house

1716
02:01:36,090 --> 02:01:37,068
and brought it to you himself!

1717
02:01:40,261 --> 02:01:42,571
If this master planner had used it
to murder two people,

1718
02:01:42,630 --> 02:01:44,667
wouldn't he have destroyed it?

1719
02:01:45,433 --> 02:01:47,344
These people have created

1720
02:01:47,402 --> 02:01:48,938
imaginary stories about everything!

1721
02:01:50,138 --> 02:01:52,243
Are you going to tell him
about the typographical error?

1722
02:01:53,474 --> 02:01:54,418
What is that?

1723
02:01:55,577 --> 02:01:57,420
A pillow with KhempaPs blood

1724
02:01:57,478 --> 02:01:58,684
was recovered from Kanhaiya's room...

1725
02:01:59,314 --> 02:02:01,294
That was recovered from
KhempaPs room only...

1726
02:02:02,317 --> 02:02:04,524
...the forensics made an
error while typing.

1727
02:02:04,986 --> 02:02:06,192
And you reminded them of this.

1728
02:02:08,489 --> 02:02:10,127
These guys wrote a letter
to the forensics to ask...

1729
02:02:10,725 --> 02:02:13,103
...if there are any
typographical errors.

1730
02:02:14,329 --> 02:02:16,070
And it's not AN error... it's errors!

1731
02:02:17,432 --> 02:02:18,638
Twenty errors of the same word

1732
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:20,379
on the same report!

1733
02:02:22,637 --> 02:02:23,547
Can I see those photographs?

1734
02:02:30,178 --> 02:02:31,521
These numbers have
been given by you,

1735
02:02:31,579 --> 02:02:32,922
not by the forensics team.

1736
02:02:33,481 --> 02:02:34,425
So let the court decide!

1737
02:02:36,317 --> 02:02:38,354
What will court do
unless we make a decision?

1738
02:02:41,322 --> 02:02:43,359
Can the case be proved in court?

1739
02:02:43,925 --> 02:02:46,337
We only have
circumstantial evidence...

1740
02:02:46,394 --> 02:02:47,532
so it will be difficult.

1741
02:02:47,996 --> 02:02:49,134
To be honest...

1742
02:02:50,064 --> 02:02:52,010
No one except the parents
could have committed the murders...

1743
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:53,606
But that they ARE the murderers,

1744
02:02:53,668 --> 02:02:56,012
this we can neither say... nor prove...

1745
02:02:57,338 --> 02:02:59,113
The case could have been proved...

1746
02:03:01,009 --> 02:03:04,252
...because one of the servants

1747
02:03:04,312 --> 02:03:06,349
was ready to become an approver...

1748
02:03:08,182 --> 02:03:09,422
But it is all past now.

1749
02:03:11,686 --> 02:03:14,166
It is better to free ten criminals,

1750
02:03:14,222 --> 02:03:15,496
than imprison one innocent...

1751
02:03:23,998 --> 02:03:27,138
There seems to be no other
option but to close the case...

1752
02:03:31,005 --> 02:03:34,953
'It's better to end a
story on a good note...

1753
02:03:36,344 --> 02:03:42,954
in case it cannot be
brought to a logical end...'

1754
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:48,626
File the closure report. Fairly.

1755
02:03:49,924 --> 02:03:50,994
Yes Sir.

1756
02:03:53,027 --> 02:03:56,008
Though our investigation clearly points...

1757
02:03:56,564 --> 02:04:00,706
...to the parents as ShrutFs killers...

1758
02:04:01,703 --> 02:04:05,014
...the evidence collected
is not strong enough...

1759
02:04:05,406 --> 02:04:07,682
...to file a chargesheet against them.

1760
02:04:09,077 --> 02:04:13,025
The CDI therefore requests
the closure of this case.

1761
02:04:14,282 --> 02:04:16,262
I will never accept this Closure Report!

1762
02:04:16,317 --> 02:04:18,456
I'll go to the Supreme Court if I have to!

1763
02:04:20,021 --> 02:04:21,261
Murderer!

1764
02:04:26,027 --> 02:04:29,065
Get the car...

1765
02:04:31,399 --> 02:04:33,242
Your report says it would be difficult

1766
02:04:33,301 --> 02:04:36,976
to prove the parents guilty in court...

1767
02:04:37,605 --> 02:04:38,583
Difficult?

1768
02:04:39,674 --> 02:04:41,176
It's not impossible, right?

1769
02:04:43,244 --> 02:04:44,689
Your Closure Report is rubbish...

1770
02:04:44,946 --> 02:04:46,619
It won't be accepted.

1771
02:04:47,949 --> 02:04:49,519
Charge the parents with murder

1772
02:04:49,584 --> 02:04:51,291
and begin the trial.

1773
02:04:52,587 --> 02:04:53,531
Is it lunchtime yet?

1774
02:05:01,095 --> 02:05:03,097
Despite lack of solid evidence

1775
02:05:03,164 --> 02:05:04,973
the court has ordered that

1776
02:05:05,032 --> 02:05:08,445
<i>the Tandems be tried for murder.</i>

1777
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:11,109
- This has shocked not just
the Tandons, -

1778
02:05:11,172 --> 02:05:13,448
- but also the (SDI.-

1779
02:05:47,442 --> 02:05:49,319
The accused Dr. Ramesh Tandon

1780
02:05:49,377 --> 02:05:50,549
and Dr. Nutan Tandon

1781
02:05:51,612 --> 02:05:53,216
are convicted under sections 302

1782
02:05:54,015 --> 02:05:56,188
and section 201

1783
02:05:57,151 --> 02:05:58,323
read with section 34 IPC.

1784
02:05:59,020 --> 02:06:04,026
Dr. Ramesh Tandon is also
convicted under section 203 IPC.

1785
02:06:05,026 --> 02:06:08,633
Under section 302 IPC both the accused

1786
02:06:09,197 --> 02:06:10,642
are fined Rs.10,000/- each

1787
02:06:10,698 --> 02:06:13,338
and sentenced to rigorous
imprisonment for life.

1788
02:06:36,057 --> 02:06:37,468
No, I want to open it now!

1789
02:06:38,559 --> 02:06:39,503
Please!

1790
02:06:40,995 --> 02:06:41,939
Q Kay-

1791
02:06:42,129 --> 02:06:43,437
Thank you!

1792
02:06:44,665 --> 02:06:45,336
WOW !

1793
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:47,344
- Camera! -

1794
02:06:48,336 --> 02:06:50,942
Papa say something
for my birthday quickly!

1795
02:06:53,174 --> 02:06:54,380
Happy bifihday Shruti!

1796
02:07:09,257 --> 02:07:11,396
<i>When dreams sfither</i>
