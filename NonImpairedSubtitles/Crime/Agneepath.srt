1
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:47,540
Lord Ganesh!

2
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,332
Shambu, we've got the
license for the salt factory.

3
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,832
Go tell Master Sir, run along...

4
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:46,165
Hello Landlord! Greetings Landlord!

5
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,707
- Master Sir's here!
- Hello, master.

6
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,415
- Greetings Master!
- Bless me, Master.

7
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,124
Hello Mr. Landlord!

8
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,749
What's the matter Sir?

9
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:07,124
They seem to
honouring you more than ever!

10
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,082
Oh... what are you saying?!

11
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,790
Sister, Viju's here.

12
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,957
Viju, go for it!

13
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,124
Very good! Very good!

14
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,290
- Go for it.
- Master... Sir, look!

15
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,957
- Suhasini.
- What?

16
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,874
Very good!

17
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,374
Surya, this isn't enough.

18
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,207
It's enough for you.

19
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,915
Surya, everyone has a
right over this money.

20
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,249
It must be distributed equally.

21
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,290
Smartass! You take your share...

22
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,499
Don't worry about the others.

23
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,207
Don't be a hero!

24
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,915
I insist, equal distribution!

25
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,124
Get lost!

26
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,832
Equal distribution, you wish!

27
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,124
Let's go.

28
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,957
Surya...

29
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,665
Vijay, stop. What are you doing?

30
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,124
Vijay... I said stop.

31
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,499
- Father, that is our money...
- Vijay.

32
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,790
Vijay, you don't have to cry...

33
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,374
Then what do you want me to do?

34
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,832
Beg and plead to people?

35
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,374
No, you shouldn't do that either.

36
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,540
So you want me to
live like a coward then?

37
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,749
I broke the pot, and he
took away all the money.

38
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,790
Is this what your Gita preaches?

39
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,124
If I see him around,
I'll punch his face.

40
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,332
And then what will happen?

41
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:59,040
He will punch your face, then
you'll punch him back again...

42
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,082
and then he'll punch you back.

43
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,040
And it will never end.

44
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:08,124
"An eye for an eye makes
the whole world blind..."

45
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,832
Mahatma Gandhi once said...

46
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,915
Mahatma Gandhi wasn't born in Mandwa!

47
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,874
My son has a lot of
anger inside of him.

48
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,582
You only preach to me.

49
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,332
Why don't you tell the others?

50
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,749
Because you are my son.

51
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,415
Come...

52
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,582
come now.

53
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,957
It isn't wrong to
care about the world...

54
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,707
but before the world
comes your own family.

55
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,957
And this is why I'm
looking out for my family.

56
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,540
I'm not telling you
to be a coward, Vijay.

57
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,540
It is important to have power...

58
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,624
the question is how you use it.

59
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,874
The weak can't say that they
have forgiven the powerful.

60
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,707
For that, the weak must
themselves become powerful.

61
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,124
Then whether or not to
forgive is up to you.

62
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,374
If you do forgive, you
will be hailed as great.

63
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:12,957
If not...

64
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,874
then you will be nothing.

65
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,290
And till you become powerful,
you get beaten up everyday.

66
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,624
Says who?

67
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,165
Keep reciting the verse with me.

68
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,374
I've done it a million times, father.

69
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,374
So what? Do it once more.

70
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,374
I derive my strength from this.

71
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,332
You shall too.

72
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,832
There you stand, a tall tree.

73
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,915
You are well-laden and tall.

74
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:45,124
But don't ever ask
for even a little shade.

75
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:51,332
On the path of fire.

76
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,415
You will never tire

77
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,832
you will never rest.

78
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,082
- You...
- Father...

79
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,624
You will never look back.

80
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:12,082
Take an oath.

81
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:17,832
On the path of fire.

82
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,832
Life is but a great scene.

83
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,915
That man is walking on.

84
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,707
With tears and sweat.

85
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:33,540
Soaked in blood.

86
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:40,290
On the path of fire.

87
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,415
You have ruled over
Mandwa for years Sir.

88
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,457
Earlier, you were the king and
the people were your subjects.

89
00:08:58,666 --> 00:08:59,832
The Master is becoming the king now.

90
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,707
Do something sir...

91
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,040
or even you will
become one of the subjects.

92
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,874
School textbooks are growing
more important than our Registers.

93
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:14,624
When does Kancha get here?

94
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,207
Tomorrow morning.

95
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,290
Hey baldie!

96
00:10:52,875 --> 00:11:01,624
No... no... I don't want mirrors...

97
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,624
No... I don't want mirrors.

98
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,332
- Kancha! Kancha! Kancha!
- I don't want mirrors. I don't want.

99
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,790
No, Kancha my son... My child.

100
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,790
Father... everyone looks at
me and calls me a ghost!

101
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,915
Father, do I...
do I look like a ghost?

102
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,582
Don't worry.

103
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,874
You are but my own father.

104
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,040
But then what's a father, a mother,
a brother or a sister?

105
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,165
What did you get with you...

106
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,540
and what will you take back?

107
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,457
Only one will survive...

108
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,040
the supreme...

109
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,957
and all powerful...

110
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,332
Kancha...

111
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,207
You should have held
up for a while longer.

112
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,874
I would have been dead. Sir...

113
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,540
Here's your share... 600 only.

114
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:16,790
Take it.

115
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,415
- 600.
- 600.

116
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,457
Now it's his turn sir...

117
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,624
- now your turn... yours... yours. Come.
- Go for it!

118
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,374
Two hundred...

119
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,749
- three hundred...
- Three hundred...

120
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,499
four hundred...

121
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,249
Sir...

122
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,374
Sir... he will die...

123
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,957
Sir... He will die...

124
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,332
Sir... he will die...

125
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,957
- Sir, what are you doing?
- I don't want.

126
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,290
Sir... he will die...

127
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,415
What are you doing?

128
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:58,874
Sir... Sir... Sir...

129
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:05,874
Sir... he will die...

130
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,457
Master...

131
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,874
Life is a lot more
precious than this game, Kancha.

132
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,290
Life is submerged underwater Master...

133
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,874
it's begging and pleading.

134
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,624
Because today life means...

135
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:43,374
money...

136
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,415
Sniff it Master...

137
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,082
you'll know what bliss means.

138
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,332
You've stepped into Mandwa
after a long time Kancha.

139
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,874
Let Mandwa respect you properly.

140
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,207
What respect are you talking about,
Master? I would've...

141
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,582
- taken it in my arms.
- Sir...

142
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,249
But the earth has heated up Master...

143
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,540
embracing her would be fatal.

144
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,957
Do you understand
what I mean by fatal...

145
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,165
an illness...

146
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,874
destruction...

147
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,415
disease.

148
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,249
And this disease will spread Master...

149
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,457
in front of your very eyes,
it will spread.

150
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:25,915
Brothers...

151
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,040
I've come here to
repay my loyalty to Mandwa.

152
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,749
I will set up a salt factory here...

153
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,124
Factory!

154
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,624
Our salt will sell outside...

155
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,040
It will command unheard of prices...

156
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,957
- and we will earn unforeseen revenues.
- Fantastic!

157
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,957
But for that...

158
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,332
I need your land on lease.

159
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,124
- Lease.
- What's lease?!

160
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,290
- I mean loan! Loan.
- Loan.

161
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,207
Loan!

162
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,957
I mean it will be on loan with me.

163
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,332
The profits of the land are yours...

164
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:08,915
the revenue is yours...

165
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,124
only the factory is mine,
and the money it makes is mine.

166
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,499
What do you say?

167
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:19,290
We accept!

168
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,665
Do you have faith in your Master?

169
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,082
Yes, we do.

170
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:40,082
Then promise you won't
loan your lands to Kancha.

171
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,082
Oh rain come to me,

172
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,874
I shall give you a bribe.

173
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,665
The bribe you have accepted,

174
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,124
the storm has arrived.

175
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,332
He's taking your land on
lease for a hundred years.

176
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,874
Which one you will
live that long to see...

177
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,874
what he actually
does with your land?

178
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,332
When it rains...

179
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,749
the land of Mandwa sprouts a plant...

180
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,499
coca!

181
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,832
Our own salt factory is
enough for Mandwa's progress.

182
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,665
We shall be both the owners
and the workers of that factory.

183
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,790
All it'll take is a little
patience and hard work...

184
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,582
From Coca, Cocaine is made...

185
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,040
whose taste causes a
man to forget himself...

186
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:30,749
whose smell makes a man feel
like he's flying in the sky...

187
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,290
it sells in the outside
markets for millions...

188
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,332
and it's been here all along...

189
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,207
yet you dimwits couldn't see it.

190
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,249
So tell Kancha that you
won't give him your land.

191
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,874
We won't!

192
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,582
Landlord, Sir...

193
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,957
the Master is conducting a meeting
with the villagers under the tree.

194
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:04,790
Master...

195
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,957
Surya said you wanted to see me.

196
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,082
Master...

197
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,874
I remember switching the lights off...

198
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,957
Suhasini, I'll be right back.

199
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,332
What's the matter?
Where are you going?

200
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,082
I guess I left the school lights on.

201
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,499
Viju, go along with your father.

202
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:34,957
Father, wait for me.

203
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,540
Soorti.

204
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,540
Father...

205
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,665
Wait here.

206
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,957
Bindiya...

207
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,290
Bindiya... What happened?

208
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,790
What happened?

209
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:15,707
How did this happen?

210
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:16,957
Bindiya...

211
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,374
Tell me, how did this happen?

212
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,582
Vijay...

213
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,790
why are you still there?

214
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,082
Get your mother, quick!

215
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,832
Hurry up!

216
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,457
Yes... tell me...

217
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,082
How did this happen?

218
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,915
Bindiya... open your eyes.

219
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:38,957
Uncle...

220
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,749
something happened to
Bindiya in school...

221
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,207
Listen to me...

222
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,415
Don't spare him!

223
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,665
Mother...

224
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,082
Mother, something
happened to Bindiya in school...

225
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,582
Father, has called you.

226
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,540
Mother!

227
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,874
Viju...

228
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:22,832
Bindiya...

229
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,374
Where is Bindiya?

230
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,499
- Bindiya. Bindiya.
- Master, where is she?

231
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,374
There is Bindiya.

232
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,082
- Bindiya...
- Bindiya...

233
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,332
Bindiya, how did this happen?

234
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,624
Bindiya, what happened?

235
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,499
Bindiya! What happened?

236
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,415
Speak up, dear. What happened?

237
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,124
Why did you come here? Who called you?

238
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,290
Answer, who called you here?

239
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,749
- What happened?
- What happened, my dear?

240
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,832
- Master...
- Master...

241
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:50,874
Master...

242
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,040
what did you do to this little girl?

243
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,499
I didn't do anything...

244
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,624
Master, Bindiya is
pointing towards you.

245
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:03,165
Bindiya...

246
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,790
Master, how could you?

247
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,957
- Darn you!
- Wait!

248
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:11,124
- Have you lost it? 
- Of course! You are the Master's disciple!

249
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,957
Listen to me...

250
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,249
So... Master, what did you do?

251
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,540
- Speak up?
- What are you insinuating?

252
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,082
What did you do to her?

253
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:21,957
Will you at least listen to me.

254
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:26,124
Darn you, master! How
could you do this, Master?

255
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,540
Viju... be careful, my dear...

256
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,707
You killed our daughter!

257
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,165
Kill him...

258
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,665
- What are you...
- You killed our daughter!

259
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,749
- Kill him.
- Wait...

260
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,124
Wait...

261
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,290
Step back, I say.

262
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,707
Step back...

263
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,040
Mother...

264
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,749
Go to your father...

265
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,957
Go to your father.

266
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:53,790
Father...

267
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,457
- Son.
- Let my father go...

268
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,332
Father...

269
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:24,915
You see, Vijay...

270
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,915
your father has committed a grave sin!

271
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,457
He doesn't deserve to live!

272
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,665
- He is the scum of our village...
- No!

273
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,082
Father!

274
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,290
You will pay for it, Master!

275
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,332
Your ghost will hang from the tree!

276
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,290
- Kill him!
- Father!

277
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,707
All of us honoured your father...

278
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,290
and he has put our honour to shame...

279
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:46,874
today we will kill your father!

280
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,707
We'll kill him and
hang him from this tree!

281
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,874
Hang him on the banyan tree.

282
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,124
Father!

283
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:03,790
A little jolt on the path of
Mandwa's progress and well-being.

284
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:24,040
Father...

285
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,582
What did you get with you...

286
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,457
and what will you take back?

287
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,290
There's no need to worry...

288
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:36,540
and no need to be afraid of anyone...

289
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,165
Who can kill you?

290
00:24:39,375 --> 00:25:08,582
The soul is neither born nor dies.

291
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:14,957
Father...

292
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:21,540
Father!

293
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:27,124
Dead!

294
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:28,874
The master is dead!

295
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:30,415
Farewell Master!

296
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:38,915
Father!

297
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:44,624
- He got what he deserved.
- The master is dead!

298
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:50,374
Father!

299
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,415
Nobody will give wood for his pyre.

300
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,249
Let him hang here.

301
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:59,082
Master, you won't
even have a cremation!

302
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,957
Let him rot.

303
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:03,124
Mandwa has been rid of this demon.

304
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:04,957
Vultures.

305
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:06,249
Leave him hanging...

306
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,832
Nobody will give wood for his pyre.

307
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:05,249
Mother... Mother, what happened?

308
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,040
Tell me, mother. Mother!

309
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:08,790
Mother, say something!

310
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:11,832
Mother, what is it?

311
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,415
What happened, mother?

312
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:15,790
I don't know what's
happening to my mother...

313
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,040
Please help!

314
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,624
Get lost kid!

315
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:20,749
It's time for business, so scram!

316
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:22,540
Somebody help my mother!

317
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:23,749
Get lost!

318
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:26,582
What the...

319
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,290
I don't know what's
happening to my mother...

320
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:30,790
She is in pain... I
don't know what's happening!

321
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:32,249
- Where is your mother?
- There!

322
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,624
Mother... are you alright?

323
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:40,874
Is my mother alright?

324
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:42,582
She will be okay, right?

325
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:44,249
She is having labor pain.

326
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:47,040
Kali what are you staring at?
Hurry up and get Ashatai!

327
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,665
Oh God!

328
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:51,790
What happened, Lachi?

329
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:53,082
Nothing yet, but something sure will!

330
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,540
- Take a look!
- Mother!

331
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:55,749
What are you crying for?

332
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,332
Take him away from here.

333
00:27:57,416 --> 00:28:00,582
Take him away... go!

334
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,457
Dulari, we need cover!

335
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:03,957
- Vijay!
- Mother!

336
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,332
All of you, what are you
staring at? Come fast!

337
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:16,790
Take a deep breath, my dear...

338
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:26,415
Mother!

339
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,040
Step back.

340
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,374
Go away.

341
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:37,165
You have a sister.

342
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:41,249
Here...

343
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:43,165
be careful.

344
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:47,749
What about my mother?

345
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:49,207
You mother is fine.

346
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:50,415
Mummy's boy!

347
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,957
Not like this!

348
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,165
This is how you tie it.

349
00:29:14,708 --> 00:29:16,290
This is the problem with new people.

350
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,832
See how it's done.

351
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:32,040
Help! Help!

352
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:58,624
Get us out of here!

353
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:01,374
Take a look at this
fine specimen, gentlemen.

354
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:02,624
Leave me!

355
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:04,915
Fresh as a rose.

356
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,582
- She is mine!
- I want her.

357
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,665
I guarantee everything about her.

358
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,249
By the grace of Allah, if
you treat and feed her well...

359
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:15,790
in a year she will blossom.

360
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:18,957
May I have the bids...

361
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,540
Thirty thousand!

362
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:27,290
Forty thousand!

363
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:29,957
Lala bhai, sixty thousand!

364
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,540
Sixty thousand!
Sixty thousand, once...

365
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:33,915
Sixty thousand, twice... Sold!

366
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,040
Sold!

367
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:39,165
No!

368
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,207
Where is the stuff from?

369
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:12,832
Afghanistan.

370
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:29,624
Let me ask again...

371
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:32,582
where is the stuff from?

372
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,749
How does it matter?
It's genuine stuff.

373
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:38,499
Where are you growing it?

374
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:41,499
I want to sell my stuff in Mumbai.

375
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:43,415
State your demand.

376
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:47,457
I never liked hide and seek.

377
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:51,832
Whether the girl is of
eleven or sixteen...

378
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,207
I buy her.

379
00:31:55,125 --> 00:32:00,957
The catch is I
should know her real age.

380
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:03,957
Now listen...

381
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:05,749
very carefully...

382
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:08,790
The fact is, Kancha...

383
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,582
I don't seem to like your face.

384
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:15,915
It's not because you are ugly.

385
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:18,790
I've seen worse.

386
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:22,582
But your face is disgusting...

387
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:23,957
disgusting.

388
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:26,707
And another thing...

389
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:28,957
business is conducted among equals.

390
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:30,707
Equals.

391
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:32,749
Kancha...

392
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,207
who 15 years ago, was merely a
small time crook in Mumbai...

393
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:39,082
nobody knows who his mother was...

394
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,374
probably is a bastard, probably not...

395
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,457
but the Police have a
picture in their record...

396
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,374
which is nothing like your face now.

397
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:52,374
Kancha, leave Mumbai or else...

398
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:55,915
Bloody Joker!

399
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:57,957
Joker!

400
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:03,374
I'm letting you go.

401
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,832
Today is my younger son's birthday.

402
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:08,082
Don't come again tomorrow.

403
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:10,332
Tomorrow it isn't his birthday.

404
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:18,707
Viju...

405
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:20,665
my mother has sent this.

406
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,457
You got your cut.

407
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,374
Now get lost.

408
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:31,790
Where is Tatya?

409
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:35,957
No. Don't do that.

410
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:37,874
No. Spare me.

411
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,957
My children are very small...

412
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:43,832
Kancha paid you to kill me...

413
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:45,665
and you accepted!

414
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:47,707
You accepted!

415
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:50,915
This bastard took money to kill me.

416
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:52,957
- Suleman!
- Yes?

417
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,790
I heard they eat dog
meat in some country...

418
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:58,415
So have I, bhai...

419
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,832
This dog accepted money to kill me.

420
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,249
I'm sure he has a large heart...

421
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,457
Let's rip it out and sell it.

422
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,874
We'll get a good price.

423
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:26,957
You...

424
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:33,290
Who are you?

425
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,874
- Vijay.
- Vijay?

426
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:37,082
Never saw you before.

427
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:38,832
How could you, if I wasn't here?

428
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:40,957
Smartass, huh?

429
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,874
Hey...

430
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,749
and who are you?

431
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,665
She is my daughter.

432
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:49,332
Oh...

433
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:52,749
she's all grown up and
I haven't noticed...

434
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:54,499
that's a wonder!

435
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:03,207
Those whores aren't going to testify.

436
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,957
Lala has cut their tongue.

437
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:10,499
But there is a twelve year old boy...

438
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:12,582
he was present at that time.

439
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:15,915
Then get him to testify.

440
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:21,790
Come on and don't you dare lie.

441
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:24,165
Tell us everything you saw
that day, just speak the truth.

442
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,165
Take it easy.

443
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:29,457
How old are you?

444
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:31,957
Twelve.

445
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,249
What's your name?

446
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,457
Vijay.

447
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:39,665
Don't be afraid.

448
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,874
Look carefully...

449
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,749
was it one of them?

450
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,499
It is important to have power...

451
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,207
the question is how you use it.

452
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,124
Don't be afraid... say it.

453
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:18,915
No.

454
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:23,207
The Police is with you,
don't be afraid.

455
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:27,790
No.

456
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,832
Vijay, this is Rauf Lala.

457
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:33,165
He killed Tatya in broad daylight.

458
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:34,874
I said it is none of them.

459
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,165
Don't lie, Vijay.

460
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:39,707
A child's words are the
voice of God, inspector.

461
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:42,165
Who can go against that?

462
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:44,374
So... can I leave?

463
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,124
Come on.

464
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,374
See you.

465
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,165
I want Mandwa...

466
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:06,332
back.

467
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:08,957
Everybody fears Lala...

468
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,457
And one day everybody will fear me.

469
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:14,624
And that very fear will
help us return to Mandwa.

470
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:17,332
We won't live here any more.

471
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:19,457
We will go away.

472
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:24,415
To a place where you won't
get these wild thoughts.

473
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:27,082
I'm scared, Vijay.

474
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:30,874
Scared for you and
your sister Shiksha.

475
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,332
Do you hear what I'm saying?

476
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:36,582
Viju... Viju, Shinde
is looking for you.

477
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:39,040
He wants to know why you
refused to identify Lala.

478
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:40,249
He is beating up my mother.

479
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:42,832
Viju, please come.

480
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:44,290
You whore...

481
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:47,124
where are you hiding the boy?

482
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:56,915
Because of what that boy did,
I had to face a lot of flak.

483
00:37:57,916 --> 00:37:59,040
Get lost.

484
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:01,915
You know who I am, don't you?

485
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:13,582
Bloody rascal...

486
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:16,832
I've been looking all over for you.

487
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:27,582
Viju, don't...

488
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,915
Look at him...
threatening me with a gun.

489
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,124
Viju, the gun will go off!

490
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:35,415
He is only a child, let him go.

491
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:38,082
You want to shoot me?

492
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:39,499
Go ahead.

493
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:42,790
Shoot... what's wrong?

494
00:38:42,916 --> 00:38:44,707
You will pay for this.

495
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:45,957
You will pay.

496
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,832
You want to shoot me...

497
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,832
you little prick!

498
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:56,540
Hey, this is not a toy gun.

499
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:05,457
Son, give me the gun. Give it to me.

500
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:10,665
Vijay, throw the gun away.

501
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,457
Throw the gun away.

502
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,790
Take a look, Lala bhai...

503
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:40,124
this is nice and fresh.

504
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:41,874
Let me see...

505
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,124
okay, cut it.

506
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,582
I want another one.

507
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,582
Look over there... Yusuf...

508
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:21,290
Woman trafficking
has gone up in Mumbai.

509
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:24,040
Additional commissioner, Mr. Gaitonde.
Are the Mumbai police sleeping?

510
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:25,290
Speak in turns.

511
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:29,957
Rauf Lala is connected
to almost every gang war.

512
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,749
Sir, don't you have
any evidence against him?

513
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,082
The police department is aware that...

514
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:39,915
under the guise
of Alif Meat Export...

515
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:42,665
Rauf Lala smuggles
drugs and traffics women.

516
00:40:43,416 --> 00:40:46,332
But he gets wind of our
action before we can make a move.

517
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:49,832
And if somebody dares to
give witness against him...

518
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:51,832
he doesn't survive.

519
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,874
This reflects the
failure of our system that...

520
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,457
a small time trader
has become the mafia...

521
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:59,457
and rules over the
biggest slum in Asia.

522
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,665
By getting the unemployed...

523
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,749
and the homeless to work
for his illegal activities...

524
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:06,165
Lala has provided them a job
and a roof over their head.

525
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:08,249
In return he has bought
their unflinching loyalty.

526
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:10,374
And they are willing to
lay down their life for him.

527
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,207
There is another name
connected to the gang wars.

528
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,457
Kancha.

529
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:17,415
The police has been successful
in keeping Kancha out from Mumbai.

530
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,499
So where does Kancha
run his operations from?

531
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:24,207
Across the coast to the south
west of Mumbai is an island.

532
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:25,957
Mandwa.

533
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:27,249
That is his empire.

534
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:30,707
He runs Mandwa like
Hitler's concentration camp.

535
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,915
Kancha is in Mandwa but...

536
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,374
his roots have penetrated the system
here a lot deeper than Rauf Lala.

537
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:41,915
Five years ago the Mumbai
police carried out a raid on Mandwa.

538
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,749
Scores of innocent
residents died in the cross firing.

539
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:49,832
And we had a tough time facing
the Human Rights Commission.

540
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,040
Kancha still harbors
an unfinished dream...

541
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,624
Mumbai.

542
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:57,332
But as long as I am alive,
I won't let him have it.

543
00:41:57,666 --> 00:41:59,415
Who is Vijay?

544
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:02,874
Is this a joke, Gaitonde?

545
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,207
I'm sorry but this is his
only official photograph...

546
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:06,415
in the police records.

547
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:07,749
Vijay Chauhan.

548
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,957
He has become a force to
reckon with in the last ten years.

549
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:13,957
He is Rauf Lala's right
hand and is very shrewd.

550
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,665
15 years ago, Rauf Lala had
bailed him out in connection...

551
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,415
with the killing
of a sub-inspector.

552
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:21,957
That was my case.

553
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:25,457
Since then the police hasn't
found any evidence against him.

554
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:29,040
Getting someone to give witness
against him has become a joke.

555
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:31,624
Everything he earns goes
into a charitable trust.

556
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,624
The trust operates a
number of ambulances in Mumbai.

557
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:35,874
Vijay Chauhan...

558
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:37,290
He looks simple...

559
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:38,749
but is the most complicated of all.

560
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:40,707
At an age when he
should've been playing with toys...

561
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,082
he learned to play
with guns and bullets.

562
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:46,165
It was as if he were at
war with law and order.

563
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:50,374
He leads a very low profile life...

564
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,707
and lives in a small
room in Dongri chawl.

565
00:42:55,958 --> 00:42:58,957
Everything he earns, he gives away...

566
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:02,957
It's like he doesn't earn
money but earns people instead.

567
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:06,915
But his sights are set
on an unknown goal...

568
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:09,665
Something that only he knows.

569
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,957
Something that he wants to achieve...

570
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:13,457
at any cost.

571
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:32,957
Viju go for it!

572
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:03,582
Lift here...

573
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:08,790
A little higher... slowly...

574
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:10,832
How's it looking?!

575
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:13,207
Babban...

576
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:14,457
wait, wait...

577
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:15,665
like this...

578
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:23,332
You look just like Madhuri Dixit.

579
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,874
Yeah right!

580
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:30,415
Move it. Madhuri Dixit, right!

581
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:33,415
She is my darling Kaali.

582
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,082
You look so much like Silk Smita...

583
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,582
Silk Smita!

584
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:39,540
Oh my Kaali!

585
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:41,207
Why are you talking about her, Laxmi?

586
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:42,457
I'm happy to be Kaali.

587
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:43,665
Kaali Gawde.

588
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,874
Take a look at my staff.

589
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:47,499
Come on, stand in a line.

590
00:45:47,916 --> 00:45:49,957
One... two... three... four.

591
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:51,624
Viju, over here!

592
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,332
They are imported.

593
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,124
Got them from Singapore...

594
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:56,332
pure Chinese!

595
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:58,165
What do they call you at home?

596
00:45:58,541 --> 00:46:00,749
- Chabeeli.
- Hey... she speaks Nepali!

597
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:04,415
Darn you! Shut up!

598
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:07,915
They live in Nepal, but
they are pure Chinese.

599
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,165
Say you are Chinese.

600
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:11,582
I am Chinese... but I live in Nepal.

601
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:12,832
See that?

602
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:17,165
Laughter channel,
let's have some claps.

603
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:20,540
Why are you here?

604
00:46:20,625 --> 00:46:21,749
You have to cut the ribbon.

605
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:23,207
Ruby, clear this crowd.

606
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:24,457
Come on...

607
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,874
Here, take this.

608
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,957
- Iqbal bhai!
- You're late, Iqbal bhai.

609
00:46:28,083 --> 00:46:29,207
Okay, go in...

610
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:30,457
be careful of the ribbon.

611
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:33,832
The camera should
focus on me... a close-up.

612
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,082
Okay?

613
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:37,124
Let all of Dongri know that...

614
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:40,082
a Chinese Beauty Parlour should
be like Kaali's and no one else.

615
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:43,874
I should be all over cable TV.

616
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:47,624
I've taken the onus of
making Dongri beautiful.

617
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:49,832
You cut the ribbon!

618
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:51,790
I have yet to give my speech.

619
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:57,332
Rupees four thousand...

620
00:46:57,541 --> 00:47:00,040
five hundred, sixty one.

621
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,415
First day collection.

622
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:07,415
And this is your share.

623
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:13,290
You helped me with the finance.

624
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:15,374
And no friendship in business.

625
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:24,624
What can I say, Viju...

626
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:26,249
I swear...

627
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:27,957
I've been dreaming
about this all my life.

628
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:30,457
To make others beautiful...

629
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,374
and look beautiful too.

630
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:36,332
I'll deck myself up in such a
way that people won't stop staring.

631
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:40,499
And they'll say, "Isn't that Kaali,
who owns the parlor?"

632
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,249
Tell me...

633
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:43,624
am I not shining bright?

634
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:45,832
So bright, I can feel it out here.

635
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:48,165
Groucho!

636
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:49,457
Oh, yes give me this.

637
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:03,165
What?

638
00:48:04,583 --> 00:48:05,874
My wedding fund.

639
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:09,582
Only if I start saving now can I...

640
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:11,582
I mean there are so many things...

641
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:13,249
clothes, jewelry...

642
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,874
You've gone so quiet, it's as if
I got you in a Police encounter.

643
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:52,874
What's wrong?

644
00:48:55,416 --> 00:48:56,540
Nothing.

645
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:06,582
I'm sorry, Viju.

646
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:09,040
Sorry.

647
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:12,290
I said too much.

648
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,499
I remember everything...

649
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,374
I understand everything.

650
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:28,374
You don't want to get married but...

651
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:32,665
what can I do?

652
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:37,665
Sometimes,
unknowingly I end up dreaming.

653
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:48,749
But don't worry about me.

654
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:52,790
I'm fine, just the way I am.

655
00:50:10,416 --> 00:50:11,540
Hello, Viju sir.

656
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:15,582
- Hello, Viju sir.
- Hello.

657
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:21,290
You wanted to see me?

658
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:23,207
Yes, come in.

659
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,207
I'm retiring this year.

660
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,665
But I don't have to tell you
that I won't go away empty handed.

661
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:40,332
Yesterday there was
an encounter in Kurla.

662
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:41,957
We shot dead six.

663
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:46,582
Four from Shantaram's gang and...

664
00:50:46,666 --> 00:50:47,790
two from Rauf Lala's.

665
00:50:49,958 --> 00:50:51,082
How is mother?

666
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:53,582
Don't you know?

667
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:55,832
I know.

668
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:57,040
If you know then why...

669
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:00,957
Tomorrow Shiksha will turn 15.

670
00:51:04,958 --> 00:51:06,374
And I'm still the same old Vijay...

671
00:51:08,416 --> 00:51:09,874
who came to this city 15 years ago.

672
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:12,082
Along with your
mother and unborn sister.

673
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:14,040
Who then left you and went away.

674
00:51:14,583 --> 00:51:16,374
Who don't live with you.

675
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:17,749
You look at them from afar and...

676
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:21,207
try to console yourself
that you also have a family.

677
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:25,499
But you still haven't worked
up the courage to meet them.

678
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,957
To gain something, you have
give something up, Gaitonde sir.

679
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:30,832
What do you want to achieve?

680
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,124
Tell me!

681
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:34,874
They are your family.

682
00:51:35,833 --> 00:51:37,957
Don't you feel like meeting them?

683
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:43,665
Can I leave?

684
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:04,290
Shiksha, hurry up or you'll be late.

685
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:05,540
Yes, mother.

686
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:07,457
Come on...

687
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:20,540
- Come on... hurry up.
- Mother, I think I'm forgetting something.

688
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:21,749
No, you are not.

689
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:23,207
I think I'm forgetting something.

690
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:25,790
No, you are not, now come on.

691
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:43,790
Mother I've forgotten my bottle.

692
00:52:44,416 --> 00:52:45,540
There you are!

693
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:50,915
I've been waiting
since morning for this.

694
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:52,290
And finally it's here.

695
00:52:52,416 --> 00:53:01,957
Who has sent this?

696
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:05,957
Tell me, please!

697
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:07,749
Who has sent this?

698
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:09,665
I... I don't know.

699
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:13,249
I just work at the store.

700
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:15,082
I don't know.

701
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:17,707
Mother, who sends
this for me every year?

702
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:26,624
Why are you here?

703
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:32,582
I don't want your world
to influence my daughter.

704
00:53:32,708 --> 00:53:33,874
He was my father too!

705
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,624
How dare you take his name!

706
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,540
You think I'll forget
everything if I don't take his name?

707
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:39,790
What are you going to do?

708
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:41,290
You want another dead body?

709
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:43,749
Because of which you are
bent on making this world hell?

710
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:45,207
This world is hell, mother.

711
00:53:45,375 --> 00:53:46,499
Without power...

712
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:48,124
If your father were alive...

713
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:49,415
But he isn't!

714
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:53,290
And it is such people who killed him.

715
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:55,499
They don't deserve to live.

716
00:53:57,125 --> 00:53:58,457
They will have to die.

717
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:00,707
Will that bring your father back?

718
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:02,915
At least I will be
able to die in peace.

719
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:48,957
"Hum away."

720
00:55:50,875 --> 00:56:18,707
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

721
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:23,540
"Get rid of all the disappointments."

722
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:29,165
"Blow out the evening
candle and enjoy the night."

723
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:34,165
"You didn't learn
but I have taught you."

724
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:39,165
"The potent remedy
that I have tested."

725
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:44,124
"Just let go of all the
tears and pain and have a blast."

726
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:54,207
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

727
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:10,624
EROS

728
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:28,874
"The burden you are carrying."

729
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:34,249
"Let me carry it and
lighten your burden."

730
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:39,624
"All the pain that
leaves you sleepless."

731
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:44,874
"Go throw all of them in the fire."

732
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:49,790
"There is more of
sorrow in your life."

733
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,874
"We'll bribe and get an
extra dose of happiness."

734
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:07,457
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

735
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:44,749
"When you make a long face,
even the sun begins to set."

736
00:58:44,875 --> 00:58:49,707
"When you smile, the moon
starts to illuminate radiantly."

737
00:58:50,416 --> 00:58:55,415
"When you are silent,
life seems unmelodious."

738
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:00,624
"When you talk, it's
like music to my ears."

739
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:05,665
"Why are you holding it all inside?"

740
00:59:05,791 --> 00:59:13,374
"Come on. Pour your heart
out to me. Hum away. Hum away."

741
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:20,874
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

742
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,124
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this
song." Where is he going? Viju.

743
00:59:24,541 --> 00:59:30,457
"I'll let my hair down and enjoy."

744
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:36,124
"I'll borrow some peace from you."

745
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:40,957
"I've learnt what you've taught me."

746
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:45,957
"I too have tried that potent remedy."

747
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:51,040
"I have let go of all the
tears and pain and had a blast."

748
00:59:51,166 --> 01:00:21,374
"Hum away. "Hum away. Hum this song."

749
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,915
According to unidentified sources...

750
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:31,957
Rauf Lala carried out these
attacks because a drug deal fell apart.

751
01:00:33,916 --> 01:00:36,957
Sir, what information does the
police have about these killings?

752
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:38,707
Their names are Karthik and Ramesh.

753
01:00:38,791 --> 01:00:39,832
They work for Shantaram...

754
01:00:39,916 --> 01:00:42,582
who actually looks after
Kancha's business in Mumbai.

755
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:45,040
The very same Kancha who has
challenged Rauf Lala and...

756
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,665
wants to control the
drug market in Mumbai.

757
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:50,832
Home Secretary Borkar,
when will Kancha be arrested?

758
01:00:50,916 --> 01:00:53,874
Now, listen to me, you are
moving away from the main point.

759
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:56,332
Right now, Kancha isn't our target.

760
01:00:56,416 --> 01:00:57,540
Rauf Lala is.

761
01:00:57,666 --> 01:00:59,749
Rauf Lala who conducts
the drugs business...

762
01:00:59,833 --> 01:01:01,624
behind a cloak of
public activities.

763
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,540
We have to rid this evil
called drugs from our society.

764
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:07,707
Sooner or later, we will do it.

765
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:08,957
Get him to stop.

766
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,374
Nothing... nothing Azhar.

767
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,624
Idiot!

768
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,749
Borkar, that bastard!

769
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,207
Kancha's slave.

770
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:19,415
Nothing's wrong, I'll be right back.

771
01:01:27,875 --> 01:01:28,957
Salaam, Lala bhai.

772
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:30,874
Everything alright, Tony?

773
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,249
Alright?

774
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,582
How many years have we
been doing business together?

775
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:35,832
What's the matter?

776
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:37,624
For the first time, we are
going back empty handed.

777
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:43,249
Your little boy over here
is quoting sky high prices.

778
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:45,957
You won't get this
quality anywhere in Mumbai!

779
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:47,957
And you will have to pay a price.

780
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,249
Take it easy, Mazhar.

781
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:50,915
You take it easy!

782
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,624
Don't talk to me like that!

783
01:01:54,541 --> 01:01:55,665
The price remains the same.

784
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,040
Alright, Lala bhai.

785
01:01:57,916 --> 01:01:59,707
We'll see you after the 20th.

786
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:04,207
Father, these bastards...

787
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:09,540
You don't do drugs
while conducting a deal.

788
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:10,790
Never!

789
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:13,415
Once that's over you
can do hash or cocaine...

790
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,624
I don't care.

791
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:18,415
We lost this deal.

792
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:22,374
Father, I know for a fact that...

793
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,832
Tony has already made a deal for the
cocaine he wants to get from us...

794
01:02:24,916 --> 01:02:27,790
and now he doesn't have the cocaine.

795
01:02:28,416 --> 01:02:29,540
So?

796
01:02:31,041 --> 01:02:32,624
He said the 20th...

797
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,832
which means he will
get the cocaine by then.

798
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:37,957
He isn't buying from us.

799
01:02:39,541 --> 01:02:42,374
So then, who else can give
him cheap cocaine in Mumbai?

800
01:02:44,583 --> 01:02:45,707
Maybe an outsider...

801
01:02:47,416 --> 01:02:48,540
Kancha.

802
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:50,374
That means Mandwa.

803
01:02:51,791 --> 01:02:55,040
100 percent pure cocaine
and a lot cheaper than us.

804
01:02:55,791 --> 01:02:58,040
Gaitonde has covered
every nook and corner.

805
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,957
He won't let Kancha's
stuff land in Mumbai.

806
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,207
I'm sure there's a place.

807
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:07,874
I know someone who can tell us.

808
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:10,040
See you later.

809
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:21,290
What are you doing?

810
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,874
Save me!

811
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:27,290
I'll fall.

812
01:03:27,666 --> 01:03:31,624
- Remember anything?
- I can't hear you.

813
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:33,915
Are you trying to kill me?

814
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:35,415
Do you remember?

815
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:37,374
I don't know anything.

816
01:03:38,083 --> 01:03:43,290
Who will look after my Pappu?

817
01:03:46,416 --> 01:03:49,040
What will happen to my Pappu?

818
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:50,332
Now do you remember?

819
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:53,290
Trust me, I don't know anything.

820
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:56,915
I am done for.

821
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,832
Help me...

822
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:01,832
Are you trying to kill me?

823
01:04:01,916 --> 01:04:03,624
Wait!

824
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:04,874
I'll tell you.

825
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:09,874
Where is Kancha's stuff landing?

826
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:15,707
At Home Secretary
Borkar's home in Goa.

827
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:25,249
Don't ask me who I am, Gaitonde sir...

828
01:04:25,791 --> 01:04:28,749
but I have news you could use.

829
01:04:31,916 --> 01:04:33,624
Everything good at the factory?

830
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:35,415
Borkar sir, all good, thanks to you.

831
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:36,874
You don't need to thank me.

832
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:39,207
I'm only a public servant.

833
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:41,457
I'll be right back.

834
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:49,999
Where's the torch?

835
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,499
Go away from here, quick!

836
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:10,790
Hey! Inspector!

837
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:15,290
Hurry up. Hurry up.

838
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:33,749
Isn't this a lot?

839
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,665
Borkar...

840
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,915
you won't get a better opportunity
to prove your loyalty to Kancha.

841
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,082
Come on.

842
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:47,124
Come on quick!

843
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,082
Hurry up!

844
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:53,040
If you could help me
with a few bottles of feni.

845
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:54,165
I have to go all the
way back to Mumbai.

846
01:05:56,791 --> 01:05:57,915
You want me to call Kancha?

847
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,249
Okay, okay... Borkar.

848
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,040
It really is very hot today.

849
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:36,665
You...

850
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:37,957
What are you doing here?

851
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:40,124
I'm here as a guest.

852
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:42,707
Where's your hospitality?

853
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,707
I'll show you...

854
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:47,082
Don't waste time. Gaitonde
will be here any minute...

855
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:49,207
with his entire force.

856
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:00,165
Gaitonde?

857
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:02,707
What's he doing here?

858
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:06,165
The Home Secretary of Maharashtra
is having a ball of a time in Goa!

859
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:10,832
You like to party in style, Borkar...

860
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:15,207
Music, dance, booze...

861
01:07:16,583 --> 01:07:17,749
and cocaine!

862
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:18,957
What...

863
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:20,040
what are you talking about?

864
01:07:27,208 --> 01:07:28,957
Shantaram has left and...

865
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:31,165
Gaitonde is outside.

866
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:32,957
He will come in any minute now.

867
01:07:39,916 --> 01:07:41,040
Here he gets his
hands on the cocaine...

868
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:43,749
and there your
Government collapses.

869
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:49,040
What... what do you want?

870
01:07:56,083 --> 01:07:57,082
Now listen...

871
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:59,165
carefully.

872
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:11,874
Gaitonde...

873
01:08:14,125 --> 01:08:15,749
what is the meaning of this?

874
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:16,957
There's cocaine here, sir.

875
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:18,957
We have information.

876
01:08:19,083 --> 01:08:20,040
Cocaine?

877
01:08:20,166 --> 01:08:21,290
Have you lost it?

878
01:08:21,666 --> 01:08:23,040
You do know you could lose your job.

879
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:25,582
That's precisely why I'm
here with a search warrant.

880
01:08:25,666 --> 01:08:26,790
I got it over night.

881
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:27,957
Guess you weren't informed.

882
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:32,040
Come on.

883
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:44,749
- Open it!
- No, no...

884
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:46,790
there's just some old stuff in here.

885
01:08:46,875 --> 01:08:48,957
Actually... actually... some of
my personal things are here.

886
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:49,999
I said open it!

887
01:08:56,916 --> 01:08:57,999
There's nothing here.

888
01:08:58,250 --> 01:08:59,624
Happy?

889
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:03,957
You've crossed your
limit this time, Gaitonde.

890
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,040
I'm the Home Secretary of Maharashtra.

891
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:07,957
You got a search warrant for my house?

892
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:11,915
I'm going to get you fired
or else I'll change my name.

893
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:13,999
He's going to kill me...

894
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:17,957
Kancha is going to kill me.

895
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:21,915
I have to do something...

896
01:09:22,916 --> 01:09:24,707
or Kancha is going to kill me!

897
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:28,040
I got it.

898
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:30,874
I'll kill Gaitonde.

899
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:33,040
Have you lost it?

900
01:09:34,791 --> 01:09:36,040
If you kill Gaitonde...

901
01:09:36,041 --> 01:09:37,790
the entire police
force will be on your tail.

902
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:41,874
His record is so clean,
even I won't be able to help.

903
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:45,999
If you want to kill someone...

904
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:48,749
kill Vijay.

905
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:55,915
Hello.

906
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:57,665
You remind me of my father.

907
01:09:59,708 --> 01:10:00,874
He would say...

908
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:04,207
"The weak can't say that they
have forgiven the powerful."

909
01:10:06,666 --> 01:10:08,999
"For that, the weak must
themselves become powerful."

910
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:16,915
Today begins my
crusade to become powerful.

911
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:18,874
What are you trying to say?

912
01:10:20,958 --> 01:10:20,999
Hello...

913
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:22,999
Hello... Vijay?

914
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:41,999
Let me go...

915
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:44,707
The more you suffer...

916
01:11:45,291 --> 01:11:47,249
the closer will your death be.

917
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:48,874
Let me go...

918
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:51,624
I'll die!

919
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:53,957
Let me go...

920
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:55,207
- You let me live...
- Leave me.

921
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:56,957
And I'll let you go!

922
01:11:57,083 --> 01:11:58,082
Let me go.

923
01:12:06,958 --> 01:12:08,040
There, I let you go.

924
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:10,665
Now, ask why.

925
01:12:10,750 --> 01:12:11,915
No.

926
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:14,707
Ask!

927
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:17,040
W... Why?

928
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,707
Because I don't want
Rauf Lala's charity.

929
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,165
I want all of Mumbai.

930
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,124
And, you can help me with that...

931
01:12:27,791 --> 01:12:29,040
you and your Kancha.

932
01:12:34,791 --> 01:12:37,040
Be prepared to prove
your loyalty to me...

933
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:40,040
I've spared your life.

934
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:43,749
And tell Kancha that...

935
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:48,040
a year later, stuff from Mandwa
will be sold throughout Mumbai!

936
01:12:50,125 --> 01:12:51,999
We'll decide on the profit,
when we meet.

937
01:12:54,666 --> 01:12:55,832
Agreed?

938
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:01,915
I suggest you drink less.

939
01:13:05,125 --> 01:13:09,957
By defeating Kancha, Vijay has
once again upheld my position.

940
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:13,040
And so, this gathering here is
witness to my proclamation that...

941
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:16,207
from today you can ask
me for anything, anytime.

942
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,957
I present you with the
territories of Bakri Adda and Dongri...

943
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:22,665
and I announce that...

944
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:25,290
from now on the people pledge
their loyalty and support to you.

945
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:28,582
May Allah bless you with
strength to defend it.

946
01:13:28,666 --> 01:13:36,040
So be it!

947
01:13:37,666 --> 01:13:40,040
There's yet another reason to rejoice.

948
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:42,832
I've decided that...

949
01:13:42,916 --> 01:13:45,082
my son, Mazhar will wed Mr.
Qureshi's daughter Saayra.

950
01:13:45,166 --> 01:13:46,290
Congratulations!

951
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:49,040
The ceremony will be held
on the 3rd of next month.

952
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:50,832
- There will be a feast.
- Congratulations!

953
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:52,749
- Congratulations. Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

954
01:13:52,916 --> 01:13:54,040
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

955
01:14:06,291 --> 01:14:07,874
- Father...
- Yes?

956
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:10,207
Those areas were rightfully mine!

957
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:11,999
So?

958
01:14:12,958 --> 01:14:14,207
I should've got those.

959
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:15,957
And you will get them.

960
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,624
But you need to
control your addiction.

961
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,040
What do you mean?

962
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:22,957
Do you see that crowd?

963
01:14:23,791 --> 01:14:24,957
He has earned it.

964
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,207
With his own hands.

965
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,040
So, it belongs to him.

966
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:29,957
You are mine.

967
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,165
My own blood.

968
01:14:31,666 --> 01:14:32,874
So, you belong to me.

969
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:34,957
I still don't get it.

970
01:14:35,666 --> 01:14:36,957
Let him rule.

971
01:14:37,666 --> 01:14:38,874
The throne belongs to you.

972
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:40,957
When you feel the time is right...

973
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:42,624
take over it.

974
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,124
What about Vijay?

975
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:51,040
Who can tell what will happen next...

976
01:14:52,166 --> 01:14:55,957
whether Vijay will live or die...

977
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:02,040
Lala bhai, your shoes.

978
01:15:06,708 --> 01:15:08,040
Whose shoes are these?

979
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:09,165
These aren't mine...

980
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,165
Vijay!

981
01:15:27,708 --> 01:15:28,832
Yes, father?

982
01:15:28,916 --> 01:15:32,582
Son, I think you wore
my shoes unknowingly.

983
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:37,665
- I'm really sorry, they looked the same. So I messed up.
- No. It's okay.

984
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:38,874
How could you not?!

985
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:41,957
Mazhar!

986
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:46,040
Hey! Vijay!

987
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:51,582
Catch him. Vijay. Come on.

988
01:15:51,666 --> 01:15:53,790
Get the car. Hurry up.

989
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:00,915
My dear, be strong.

990
01:16:01,208 --> 01:16:02,874
Allah is great.

991
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:06,957
- Boss. Boss.
- Out of the way!

992
01:16:06,958 --> 01:16:08,582
Move. Move.

993
01:16:10,875 --> 01:16:12,040
Please wait here.

994
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:14,040
Please move out of the way.

995
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:15,165
Doctor...

996
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:17,249
he is the reason I'm still alive!

997
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,957
When you bring him out,
I want him alive!

998
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,165
What's his condition?

999
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,957
He's alive, sir. He will survive.

1000
01:16:23,041 --> 01:16:24,207
Any information? About the shooter?

1001
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:25,957
Nothing, sir.

1002
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:28,958
But there's something you should know.

1003
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:30,999
What is it, Doctor?

1004
01:16:31,041 --> 01:16:33,040
You are still over here?
Please wait over there.

1005
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:35,249
He is our patient. Let us do our work.

1006
01:16:35,666 --> 01:16:37,957
Who do you think you're talking to?

1007
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:39,082
He is talking to you.

1008
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:42,040
To all of you!

1009
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:45,790
I want this corridor
to be cleared right now!

1010
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:48,957
You think there's a circus here?

1011
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,957
Take it easy.

1012
01:17:14,125 --> 01:17:15,624
Doctor, how's he doing now?

1013
01:17:15,833 --> 01:17:16,957
He is better now.

1014
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:23,124
Doctor, give me a minute.

1015
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,790
Okay.

1016
01:17:29,833 --> 01:17:30,957
What are you trying to do?

1017
01:17:32,291 --> 01:17:33,707
What do you mean?

1018
01:17:33,791 --> 01:17:34,957
Let me explain...

1019
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:37,874
You were shot with a .22 bore.

1020
01:17:38,791 --> 01:17:41,582
Shot from an ordinary
gun from the front...

1021
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:43,749
that too on the shoulder!

1022
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:45,832
What are you getting at?

1023
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:48,957
Assasins don't use a .22 bore weapon.

1024
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:50,874
Especially...

1025
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:52,790
when their target is Vijay Chauhan!

1026
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:56,582
Their target was Mazhar.

1027
01:17:58,166 --> 01:18:00,749
That thought can impress Rauf Lala.

1028
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:01,957
Not me.

1029
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,832
You weren't shot at.
You've been kept alive.

1030
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,290
And the questions is... why?

1031
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:11,707
Gaitonde sir, I don't
understand what you're trying to say.

1032
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:15,207
We got an empty whiskey
bottle from that building.

1033
01:18:16,875 --> 01:18:18,832
We have taken the fingerprints and...

1034
01:18:18,916 --> 01:18:20,915
it will take us no longer than a
week to identify the fingerprints.

1035
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:23,874
Make the most of this time.

1036
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:34,915
Hey... what about my sherwani?

1037
01:18:37,041 --> 01:18:38,082
Where is my sherwani?

1038
01:18:38,166 --> 01:18:39,290
I got it made myself.

1039
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:40,790
You'll look like a star.

1040
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:41,957
A hero!

1041
01:18:42,125 --> 01:18:43,249
Right?

1042
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:46,582
You're the hero, in my eyes.

1043
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:48,082
Trust me...

1044
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:50,040
I'm indebted to you, brother.

1045
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,207
Now, I don't have two but three sons.

1046
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:58,957
And together you
will rule over Mumbai.

1047
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,707
- Okay?
- Sure.

1048
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:03,040
But one of us is to
be sacrificed today.

1049
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:04,749
Of course!

1050
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:06,790
The groom!

1051
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:10,040
Lala bhai, the guests have arrived.

1052
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:11,124
They are asking for you.

1053
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:14,665
Okay... tell Yusuf
to get the car ready.

1054
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:17,040
Vijay, get Mazhar
dressed and bring him.

1055
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:18,790
I'll take Azhar along. Come on.

1056
01:19:19,291 --> 01:19:21,290
And don't be late. The
guests have arrived.

1057
01:19:25,083 --> 01:19:26,957
See how good it will look on you.

1058
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,290
Bhai, the next sherwani will be yours!

1059
01:19:33,916 --> 01:19:35,040
Mazhar bhai, call for you.

1060
01:19:35,208 --> 01:19:37,082
He won't take any
calls today. You answer it.

1061
01:19:37,166 --> 01:19:39,040
He has the information.
About the shooter.

1062
01:19:39,083 --> 01:19:40,082
What?

1063
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:41,582
He says... he'll only talk to you.

1064
01:19:41,666 --> 01:19:42,999
Well then, give me the phone.

1065
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:47,790
Yes?

1066
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:01,874
Bastard!

1067
01:20:02,208 --> 01:20:03,624
Mazhar!

1068
01:20:04,041 --> 01:20:06,040
Shantaram shot you that day.

1069
01:20:06,083 --> 01:20:07,999
- On Kancha's orders.
- Shantaram?

1070
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:10,999
Yes! The bastard is alone
at his factory right now.

1071
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:12,957
Mazhar, wait. I'll go.

1072
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:15,582
I won't get married
until I shoot him dead.

1073
01:20:15,666 --> 01:20:16,874
It's your wedding today, Mazhar!

1074
01:20:16,958 --> 01:20:17,957
I swear on Allah...

1075
01:20:18,125 --> 01:20:20,957
until I see his body,
I won't get married.

1076
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,082
Mazhar!

1077
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:47,999
EROS

1078
01:20:56,666 --> 01:21:05,124
"You have the magnificence and
grandness that befits an emperor."

1079
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:14,124
"You are the chosen one."

1080
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:18,915
"You can turn mud into
gold with a mere touch."

1081
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:22,957
"The enemy stands no chance
when you wield your sword."

1082
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,665
"God has bestowed you with His grace."

1083
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:31,957
"Even the angels bow down to you."

1084
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,249
"You are the messiah and the savior."

1085
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:40,957
"Whatever you saw becomes the law."

1086
01:21:42,833 --> 01:21:44,832
Come. Get in.

1087
01:21:47,291 --> 01:21:54,749
Bastard!

1088
01:21:58,916 --> 01:22:00,790
Let's get out of here.

1089
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:28,790
"The heavenly sight is
before your eyes today."

1090
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:32,957
"The apple of your eye is
your shadow. Your reflection."

1091
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,707
"Everyone has
blessings for him today."

1092
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:41,999
"He is the successor to
the throne of your kingdom."

1093
01:22:49,166 --> 01:22:51,582
"May ever loss be
slower than your victory."

1094
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:55,957
"Destiny is nothing but a toy to you."

1095
01:22:56,041 --> 01:23:00,665
"The enemy stands no chance
when you wield your sword."

1096
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:04,832
"You are the messiah and the savior."

1097
01:23:04,916 --> 01:23:09,124
"Even the angels bow down to you."

1098
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:13,790
"You are the messiah and the savior."

1099
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:18,832
"Whatever you saw becomes
the law. Glory to Allah."

1100
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:53,999
"No common man is common."

1101
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:57,790
"And no one's a king."

1102
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,249
"I am the emperor..."

1103
01:24:01,958 --> 01:24:05,040
"...only because you've
accepted me as your king."

1104
01:24:13,625 --> 01:24:16,832
"No common man is common."

1105
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,290
"And no one's a king."

1106
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:42,665
Brother...

1107
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:45,790
brother, the gun...

1108
01:25:06,875 --> 01:25:08,957
Bastard!

1109
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:12,790
Son of a bitch!

1110
01:25:16,666 --> 01:25:19,290
Father called you his 'Son' today.

1111
01:25:20,125 --> 01:25:21,874
My suspicion was right.

1112
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:25,624
You had your sights
on father's empire.

1113
01:25:27,708 --> 01:25:29,790
Shoot me...

1114
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,124
Shoot me or I will kill you!

1115
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:33,582
Shoot!

1116
01:25:33,666 --> 01:25:34,832
Shoot me...

1117
01:25:44,208 --> 01:25:45,832
He's gone!

1118
01:25:45,916 --> 01:25:48,707
"Stick those strong shoulders out."

1119
01:25:48,791 --> 01:25:51,624
"They are God's own children."

1120
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:54,582
"The lines on their palms..."

1121
01:25:54,666 --> 01:25:57,207
"...are the maps of your worlds."

1122
01:25:57,291 --> 01:25:59,832
"Life takes a new
course at every step."

1123
01:25:59,916 --> 01:26:01,957
"This is what I believe."

1124
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,790
"Those two mean the world to me."

1125
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:05,957
"Stick those strong shoulders out."

1126
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:10,582
"They are God's own children."

1127
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:13,832
"The lines on their palms..."

1128
01:26:13,916 --> 01:26:16,957
"...are the maps of your worlds."

1129
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:21,790
The first pillar of Rauf
Lala's empire has collapsed.

1130
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:30,040
Hey...

1131
01:26:30,791 --> 01:26:32,124
what are you doing?

1132
01:26:32,833 --> 01:26:34,333
Alcohol is bad for health.

1133
01:26:37,208 --> 01:26:39,790
Leaving an empty
bottle at a crime scene...

1134
01:26:41,083 --> 01:26:42,207
is even worse.

1135
01:26:42,291 --> 01:26:43,874
What do you mean?

1136
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:44,957
I mean...

1137
01:26:46,208 --> 01:26:49,957
I don't need Rauf
Lala to get to Kancha...

1138
01:26:51,666 --> 01:26:52,832
and now...

1139
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:55,749
not even you.

1140
01:26:57,208 --> 01:27:03,957
"Glory to Allah! Glory to Allah!"

1141
01:28:27,291 --> 01:28:29,415
Shantaram was Kancha's
right-hand man, sir.

1142
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:30,582
My question is...

1143
01:28:30,666 --> 01:28:32,582
with Kancha running
his empire in Mandwa...

1144
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:34,582
doesn't the Mumbai
police have any power to...

1145
01:28:34,666 --> 01:28:39,582
I believe, Home Secretary Borkar
is better equipped to answer that.

1146
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:41,624
Once we have his orders...

1147
01:28:42,375 --> 01:28:43,665
we will attack Mandwa.

1148
01:28:44,833 --> 01:28:46,249
Listen...

1149
01:28:46,541 --> 01:28:49,582
for some reason, the permission
hasn't been given all this while...

1150
01:28:49,666 --> 01:28:52,707
The last time police attacked Mandwa,
some innocent civilians were...

1151
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:54,665
Just for the sake of a
few civilian lives...

1152
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:57,457
we cannot put the whole
of Mumbai in jeopardy.

1153
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,499
I want your permission.

1154
01:28:59,666 --> 01:29:03,582
I promise, I will give the
permission on a priority basis.

1155
01:29:03,625 --> 01:29:05,582
We want results, not empty promises!

1156
01:29:05,625 --> 01:29:07,332
- Listen...
- We don't want to listen.

1157
01:29:07,416 --> 01:29:08,540
Mr. Gaitonde...

1158
01:29:08,625 --> 01:29:10,582
we want you to
comment on this, please.

1159
01:29:10,666 --> 01:29:12,540
Well, we have some leads...

1160
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:15,790
and it seems that due
to these gang wars...

1161
01:29:16,375 --> 01:29:17,874
the underworld is shaken up.

1162
01:29:18,375 --> 01:29:19,624
As we speak Rauf Lala is in the ICCU.

1163
01:29:19,708 --> 01:29:20,832
Can we expect that...

1164
01:29:21,166 --> 01:29:22,790
Lala's rule of terror is over now?

1165
01:29:22,875 --> 01:29:25,707
Who do you think is next
in line to be the heir?

1166
01:29:25,791 --> 01:29:29,499
Considering Rauf Lala's son,
Azhar's mental health...

1167
01:29:29,583 --> 01:29:31,290
there is only one obvious choice...

1168
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,374
Vijay Chauhan!

1169
01:31:14,583 --> 01:31:16,332
I guess you've heard my name...

1170
01:31:16,875 --> 01:31:18,290
Kancha.

1171
01:31:26,625 --> 01:31:27,582
I have.

1172
01:31:27,666 --> 01:31:29,540
I'm sure you've also heard...

1173
01:31:29,541 --> 01:31:31,874
What did you get with you
and what will you take back.

1174
01:31:34,458 --> 01:31:36,707
Impressive, my
reputation precedes me...

1175
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:40,457
So, what will you take back?

1176
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:43,582
I shall give...

1177
01:31:44,458 --> 01:31:45,624
something...

1178
01:31:46,208 --> 01:31:47,332
to you.

1179
01:31:47,416 --> 01:31:48,582
What do you mean?

1180
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:51,540
We'll talk when we meet.

1181
01:31:51,625 --> 01:31:53,374
Well, I can't come to Mumbai.

1182
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:56,874
I'll come to Mandwa.

1183
01:31:57,458 --> 01:31:59,540
Even after you killed Shantaram?

1184
01:31:59,541 --> 01:32:02,415
You don't need minnows
in the long run, Kancha.

1185
01:32:03,541 --> 01:32:05,624
Very true... Very true.

1186
01:32:06,666 --> 01:32:07,749
Come then...

1187
01:32:08,666 --> 01:32:11,457
we'll prepare ourselves to honour you.

1188
01:32:12,583 --> 01:32:14,582
Mandwa awaits you.

1189
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:36,582
Surya...

1190
01:32:37,416 --> 01:32:39,332
Vijay Chauhan is coming to Mandwa.

1191
01:32:39,666 --> 01:32:40,665
Really?

1192
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:43,665
After having killed Shantaram?

1193
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,499
Shantaram's are meant to die.

1194
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:48,290
What do you mean?

1195
01:32:51,625 --> 01:32:53,624
Vijay could've worked
out a deal on the phone.

1196
01:32:55,166 --> 01:32:57,582
Why would he want to
come here for that?

1197
01:32:57,666 --> 01:33:00,290
That's what I'm asking, Kancha sir.

1198
01:33:06,666 --> 01:33:09,582
You asking amounts to nothing...

1199
01:33:10,458 --> 01:33:13,332
you good-for-nothing.

1200
01:33:15,625 --> 01:33:17,582
It's I who should ask.

1201
01:33:18,875 --> 01:33:20,249
Right?

1202
01:33:22,166 --> 01:33:31,499
It's I who should ask...

1203
01:35:17,416 --> 01:35:19,290
There was a school there...

1204
01:35:20,625 --> 01:35:22,165
and a master as well.

1205
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:25,415
Master...

1206
01:35:26,333 --> 01:35:27,499
Bindiya!

1207
01:35:27,666 --> 01:35:28,665
Bindya what happened?

1208
01:35:29,833 --> 01:35:31,249
Why are you still there?

1209
01:35:31,333 --> 01:35:32,582
Get your mother, quick!

1210
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:39,165
Kancha is waiting...

1211
01:35:41,208 --> 01:35:42,332
let's go.

1212
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:13,290
Vijay!

1213
01:36:29,333 --> 01:36:30,540
Viju!

1214
01:36:39,333 --> 01:36:40,665
That is the Master's house.

1215
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:45,624
His son broke my nose.

1216
01:36:46,541 --> 01:36:47,665
So I burnt down his house.

1217
01:36:48,166 --> 01:36:49,582
Tit for tat.

1218
01:36:52,291 --> 01:36:54,624
I set fire to the house.

1219
01:36:57,875 --> 01:36:59,624
Kancha is waiting...

1220
01:37:00,583 --> 01:37:01,707
Let's go...

1221
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:18,707
He doesn't deserve to live!

1222
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:20,874
He is the scum of our village... Scum!

1223
01:37:21,208 --> 01:37:24,582
Master! Your ghost
will hang from the tree...

1224
01:37:25,333 --> 01:37:27,582
Mandva has been rid of a monster.

1225
01:37:35,541 --> 01:37:37,582
Nobody will give wood for his pyre.

1226
01:37:39,625 --> 01:37:41,665
He won't even find a place in hell!

1227
01:37:42,166 --> 01:37:45,665
Master, you won't
even have a cremation!

1228
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:47,415
Let him rot.

1229
01:37:47,541 --> 01:37:50,290
A man like him should be
treated like this only!

1230
01:38:15,583 --> 01:38:17,332
Kancha sir!

1231
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:11,415
Father!

1232
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:24,249
EROS

1233
01:40:32,666 --> 01:40:36,540
Silky siren. Silky siren!

1234
01:40:52,791 --> 01:40:57,665
"My eyes are so full of venom."

1235
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:01,457
"My wink kills.
Darn this dainty waist of mine."

1236
01:41:01,583 --> 01:41:03,665
"Can kill a millions with a jerk."

1237
01:41:08,916 --> 01:41:14,332
"My eyes are so full of venom."

1238
01:41:14,416 --> 01:41:17,332
"My wink kills.
Darn this dainty waist of mine."

1239
01:41:17,416 --> 01:41:19,415
"Can kill a millions with a jerk."

1240
01:41:19,625 --> 01:41:24,540
"Have come here for change
for thousands of rupees."

1241
01:41:24,875 --> 01:41:29,624
"Have come to light cigarettes and
cigars with the fire of my body."

1242
01:41:29,708 --> 01:41:32,957
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1243
01:41:33,291 --> 01:41:35,374
"After downing a peg or two."

1244
01:41:35,458 --> 01:41:38,457
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1245
01:41:38,541 --> 01:41:40,582
"After downing a peg or two."

1246
01:41:40,666 --> 01:41:43,582
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1247
01:41:43,625 --> 01:41:45,915
"After downing a peg or two."

1248
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,832
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1249
01:41:48,916 --> 01:41:51,582
"After downing a peg or two."

1250
01:42:03,833 --> 01:42:06,374
You remind me of someone...

1251
01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:09,915
Who?

1252
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,499
I can't tell...

1253
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:13,332
but you definitely
remind me of someone.

1254
01:42:16,666 --> 01:42:18,415
Why did you kill Mazhar?

1255
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,665
Shantaram killed Mazhar.

1256
01:42:23,791 --> 01:42:25,665
And, why did you kill Shantaram?

1257
01:42:27,583 --> 01:42:28,624
To get in touch with you.

1258
01:42:29,583 --> 01:42:30,707
And if I were to kill you...

1259
01:42:30,791 --> 01:42:32,582
right now? Then?

1260
01:42:32,916 --> 01:42:34,582
Then you'll never get Mumbai.

1261
01:42:34,958 --> 01:42:36,874
You carry Mumbai in your pockets?

1262
01:42:41,625 --> 01:42:42,790
No, in my shoes.

1263
01:43:05,416 --> 01:43:07,957
"I'll go crazy in the jungle today."

1264
01:43:08,291 --> 01:43:10,415
"I'll play with hungry lions."

1265
01:43:10,541 --> 01:43:13,499
"I'll carry burning coal..."

1266
01:43:13,583 --> 01:43:15,290
"...on my butter like palms."

1267
01:43:15,458 --> 01:43:18,624
"I am the fish of the
deep waters, darling."

1268
01:43:18,708 --> 01:43:21,332
"I have roamed
different sea and shores."

1269
01:43:21,416 --> 01:43:25,707
"I have lost to your stare today."

1270
01:43:25,958 --> 01:43:28,874
"My charisma kills."

1271
01:43:29,333 --> 01:43:31,582
"But it appears to be sweet."

1272
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:33,540
"My charisma kills."

1273
01:43:33,583 --> 01:43:34,582
"But it appears to be sweet."

1274
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:37,540
"I'll serve it for you
with love. Come, get it."

1275
01:43:37,625 --> 01:43:39,582
"This is just a trailer."

1276
01:43:39,625 --> 01:43:42,374
"I have come to show
the entire movie."

1277
01:43:42,583 --> 01:43:47,499
"Have come to light cigarettes and
cigars with the fire of my body."

1278
01:43:47,583 --> 01:43:50,665
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1279
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:52,749
"After downing a peg or two."

1280
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:55,957
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1281
01:43:56,291 --> 01:43:58,415
"After downing a peg or two."

1282
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:01,540
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1283
01:44:01,708 --> 01:44:03,582
"After downing a peg or two."

1284
01:44:03,666 --> 01:44:06,624
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1285
01:44:06,708 --> 01:44:10,624
"After downing a peg or two."

1286
01:44:37,916 --> 01:44:41,499
"Fun has come visiting
this barren neighborhood."

1287
01:44:41,625 --> 01:44:43,707
"So very interesting is your face."

1288
01:44:43,791 --> 01:44:46,582
"Your colors have
colored my intentions."

1289
01:44:46,666 --> 01:44:48,582
"it is deep and will not fade away."

1290
01:44:49,458 --> 01:44:51,915
"My beauty is like the butter knife."

1291
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,540
"Cuts through all the curtains."

1292
01:44:54,708 --> 01:44:57,540
"My nights are lonely."

1293
01:44:57,708 --> 01:44:59,332
"I will share them with you."

1294
01:44:59,541 --> 01:45:02,374
"My words are a signal."

1295
01:45:02,583 --> 01:45:04,957
"In them lies the game."

1296
01:45:05,291 --> 01:45:07,957
"My words are a signal.
In them lies the game."

1297
01:45:08,291 --> 01:45:10,624
"Break open the
treasure and plunder it."

1298
01:45:10,708 --> 01:45:15,624
"I have come to heal your
wounds by kissing them."

1299
01:45:15,916 --> 01:45:20,790
"Have come to light cigarettes and
cigars with the fire of my body."

1300
01:45:20,875 --> 01:45:24,499
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1301
01:45:24,583 --> 01:45:26,374
"After downing a peg or two."

1302
01:45:26,458 --> 01:45:27,582
"Here comes the silky siren."

1303
01:45:30,625 --> 01:45:34,624
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1304
01:45:34,708 --> 01:45:36,749
"After downing a peg or two."

1305
01:45:36,833 --> 01:45:39,915
"Here comes the silky siren.
Quietly and alone."

1306
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,582
"After downing a peg or two."

1307
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:45,790
A nobody from the
chawls of Dongri is here...

1308
01:45:50,708 --> 01:45:52,665
to sell Mumbai to me.

1309
01:45:56,791 --> 01:45:58,665
There must be
something you want in return.

1310
01:46:02,625 --> 01:46:03,790
What?

1311
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:08,915
Mandwa.

1312
01:46:11,625 --> 01:46:13,582
You've asked Ravan for his Lanka.

1313
01:46:28,666 --> 01:46:29,665
Wait!

1314
01:46:39,708 --> 01:46:40,624
If you had asked for anything else...

1315
01:46:40,708 --> 01:46:45,290
you would find how generous Kancha is.

1316
01:46:49,291 --> 01:47:02,499
Come on.

1317
01:47:12,583 --> 01:47:14,582
If you are through
with the welcome parade...

1318
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:16,624
can we get down to business?

1319
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:21,457
There's definitely
something about you.

1320
01:47:22,583 --> 01:47:24,624
You know I can't kill you.

1321
01:47:25,583 --> 01:47:27,540
At least not now.

1322
01:47:28,916 --> 01:47:30,582
No weaknesses...

1323
01:47:31,375 --> 01:47:32,624
no troubles...

1324
01:47:34,958 --> 01:47:37,290
No relationships
tugging at the heart...

1325
01:47:38,458 --> 01:47:43,332
finally I get who you remind me of...

1326
01:47:45,666 --> 01:47:46,665
Myself.

1327
01:47:49,291 --> 01:47:50,499
Then it's agreed.

1328
01:47:51,541 --> 01:47:52,707
Mumbai is mine.

1329
01:47:53,916 --> 01:47:55,957
Because Rauf Lala isn't there.

1330
01:47:57,333 --> 01:47:58,624
His empire is no more.

1331
01:47:59,666 --> 01:48:00,707
Who is still there?

1332
01:48:02,625 --> 01:48:04,290
Oh yes, Gaitonde.

1333
01:48:05,708 --> 01:48:07,957
I want Gaitonde dead.

1334
01:48:12,333 --> 01:48:14,290
And I'll give Mandwa to you as a gift.

1335
01:48:14,375 --> 01:48:15,499
Kancha sir...

1336
01:48:23,625 --> 01:48:24,874
The deal is done, Vijay.

1337
01:48:24,958 --> 01:48:26,332
Congratulations!

1338
01:48:26,416 --> 01:48:27,540
Congratulations, Vijay!

1339
01:48:30,791 --> 01:48:31,915
Deal is final.

1340
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,415
Surya, our deal is done.

1341
01:48:45,333 --> 01:48:46,624
We have a deal, Vijay.

1342
01:48:48,541 --> 01:48:49,624
Congratulations!

1343
01:48:51,833 --> 01:48:53,290
Take this away!

1344
01:48:53,458 --> 01:48:54,707
Lala isn't cripple!

1345
01:48:54,791 --> 01:48:56,499
Greetings Lala bhai...

1346
01:48:57,333 --> 01:48:58,540
Lala bhai...

1347
01:48:58,791 --> 01:49:01,540
the night Mazhar was shot
another body was found there.

1348
01:49:01,916 --> 01:49:03,415
Shantaram's.

1349
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:08,415
Where is that bastard Vijay?

1350
01:49:08,916 --> 01:49:10,832
He's gone to Mandwa to meet Kancha.

1351
01:49:25,666 --> 01:49:30,290
Falling into such deep sleep
can be injurious to health.

1352
01:49:31,833 --> 01:49:33,749
You didn't tell me
that you have a sister.

1353
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:39,457
Your father has
regained consciousness.

1354
01:49:45,250 --> 01:49:46,540
Lathi charge...!

1355
01:49:48,625 --> 01:49:49,957
It's an emergency, sir.

1356
01:49:50,291 --> 01:49:51,540
I need the orders.

1357
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:56,582
I will need to call for a
cabinet meeting, it will take time.

1358
01:49:56,625 --> 01:49:57,665
You calm down Gaitonde...

1359
01:50:00,666 --> 01:50:03,582
Sir, more than two thousand
people are gathered there...

1360
01:50:03,625 --> 01:50:04,874
to watch the girl being sold.

1361
01:50:04,958 --> 01:50:07,499
I need your permission to open fire...

1362
01:50:08,916 --> 01:50:10,290
sir...

1363
01:50:10,375 --> 01:50:11,499
Viju bhai...

1364
01:50:11,583 --> 01:50:12,832
Rauf Lala has taken
Shiksha to lmamwada.

1365
01:50:12,916 --> 01:50:14,540
Even the Police can't get through.

1366
01:50:16,666 --> 01:50:17,624
Where is Laxmi?

1367
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:20,374
Let you go?

1368
01:50:20,458 --> 01:50:21,915
I'll display you before the market.

1369
01:50:22,250 --> 01:50:23,415
Stand up!

1370
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:26,332
Only then will my
son's soul rest in peace.

1371
01:50:26,416 --> 01:50:29,624
- Vijay, help. 
- That Vijay will beg and plead before me!

1372
01:50:31,916 --> 01:50:34,332
Leave me!

1373
01:50:34,416 --> 01:50:37,582
Stand here!

1374
01:50:37,666 --> 01:50:38,582
Gentlemen!

1375
01:50:38,666 --> 01:50:40,582
This is the finest quality!

1376
01:50:40,666 --> 01:50:42,957
- Leave me!
- And I demand a price to match.

1377
01:50:43,291 --> 01:50:45,290
Gorgeous face...

1378
01:50:45,375 --> 01:50:46,749
Complete in every way.

1379
01:50:46,833 --> 01:50:49,957
- Uncle...
- May I have the bids, gentlemen!

1380
01:51:05,875 --> 01:51:08,582
Lala bhai... one hundred thousand.

1381
01:51:08,666 --> 01:51:11,499
Two hundred thousand!

1382
01:51:11,583 --> 01:51:13,624
Gentlemen, this stuff
deserves more than that!

1383
01:51:13,916 --> 01:51:15,582
Look at her glow...

1384
01:51:15,666 --> 01:51:17,749
Look at her color. Look at
the radiance she exudes.

1385
01:51:17,833 --> 01:51:20,249
And innocence demands a price!

1386
01:51:45,666 --> 01:51:47,665
Lala bhai, five hundred thousand.

1387
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:50,332
Five hundred thousand!

1388
01:51:50,416 --> 01:51:51,957
Now that's something!
Five hundred thousand!

1389
01:51:52,666 --> 01:51:53,832
Five hundred thousand, going once...

1390
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:57,290
- Going twice...
- No.

1391
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:02,499
Going thrice.

1392
01:52:08,375 --> 01:52:11,374
- No. Leave me.
- Lala fell for your ugly face!

1393
01:52:11,458 --> 01:52:13,582
I'm sure you won't
even leave the bones.

1394
01:52:13,625 --> 01:52:15,415
Come, take your winning!

1395
01:52:15,666 --> 01:52:16,749
Here...

1396
01:52:16,916 --> 01:52:18,290
Shut up!

1397
01:52:18,375 --> 01:52:19,499
Stand here!

1398
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,707
Amazing Lala bhai...

1399
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:23,874
No, please, let me go!

1400
01:52:23,958 --> 01:52:27,415
This time you've got
something exceptional.

1401
01:52:27,541 --> 01:52:29,665
Enjoy! Have fun!

1402
01:52:39,791 --> 01:52:40,915
No.

1403
01:52:43,833 --> 01:52:45,290
Khalid, fire!

1404
01:53:03,625 --> 01:53:04,832
Let me go, please!

1405
01:53:05,625 --> 01:53:06,915
Please, leave me.

1406
01:53:07,541 --> 01:53:11,457
No, brother! Let me go...

1407
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:19,832
Please, leave me.

1408
01:53:22,416 --> 01:53:24,415
Father!

1409
01:53:28,625 --> 01:53:30,874
Don't call me father, you bastard!

1410
01:53:32,583 --> 01:53:33,832
Lala is my name!

1411
01:53:34,541 --> 01:53:35,790
Rauf Lala.

1412
01:53:36,666 --> 01:53:41,374
And Rauf Lala never leaves the
market without selling the girl.

1413
01:53:42,541 --> 01:53:44,499
Let the bidding start again!

1414
01:53:50,458 --> 01:53:51,582
I said, step back.

1415
01:53:52,375 --> 01:53:53,624
Come on, step back.

1416
01:54:02,625 --> 01:54:04,457
Bloody son of a bitch...

1417
01:54:05,583 --> 01:54:06,874
you'll never forget that...

1418
01:54:07,666 --> 01:54:11,749
for a moment I made
you go through hell.

1419
01:54:11,833 --> 01:54:13,499
Give my girl back!

1420
01:54:48,583 --> 01:54:51,457
Worthless... traitor!

1421
01:55:13,708 --> 01:55:17,790
An object like this
doesn't Hit the market everyday.

1422
01:55:18,666 --> 01:55:20,499
If I squeeze her...

1423
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:23,582
a sweet scent will ooze out from her.

1424
01:55:23,875 --> 01:55:26,540
Sweet scent will ooze out.

1425
01:55:26,750 --> 01:55:31,790
Dear. I'll make a
scent out of this girl.

1426
01:55:49,875 --> 01:55:51,082
Vijay...

1427
01:55:52,583 --> 01:55:53,874
Vijay, let him go.

1428
01:55:53,958 --> 01:55:57,582
If I weren't mourning for my son...

1429
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:00,790
I swear, I would have
taken her to bed myself.

1430
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:07,957
Vijay...

1431
01:56:08,833 --> 01:56:10,749
Mother!

1432
01:56:11,958 --> 01:56:13,415
Vijay, stop!

1433
01:56:16,666 --> 01:56:17,665
Mother!

1434
01:56:17,750 --> 01:56:18,874
Shiksha!

1435
01:56:23,583 --> 01:56:24,624
Vijay, let him go!

1436
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:26,457
Vijay, don't!

1437
01:56:26,541 --> 01:56:27,624
Mother, how do you know him?

1438
01:56:27,708 --> 01:56:29,082
Vijay, let him go!

1439
01:56:30,458 --> 01:56:31,582
Mother, who is he?

1440
01:56:31,583 --> 01:56:32,582
Vijay, let him go!

1441
01:56:32,625 --> 01:56:33,790
Mother...

1442
01:56:46,958 --> 01:56:48,499
Mother, who is he?

1443
01:56:48,583 --> 01:56:50,415
Tell me. Why don't you say something?

1444
01:56:50,541 --> 01:56:52,957
Mother, who is he? Tell me.

1445
01:56:53,041 --> 01:56:55,624
- Mother... Answer me!
- He is your brother!

1446
01:57:05,583 --> 01:57:06,415
He is your brother!

1447
01:58:06,541 --> 01:58:07,624
Hurry up.

1448
01:58:09,666 --> 01:58:12,749
And bring two packets of
Nikhar dye. Dark black.

1449
01:58:15,625 --> 01:58:16,707
Shiksha?

1450
01:58:21,916 --> 01:58:24,582
Shiksha, what are you doing here?

1451
01:58:27,291 --> 01:58:28,582
Are you here to see Vijay?

1452
01:58:31,541 --> 01:58:32,582
Wait here.

1453
01:58:32,791 --> 01:58:34,957
Pappu, come here.

1454
01:58:36,291 --> 01:58:38,832
Tell Vijay, his sister Shiksha
is here. Repeat what I said.

1455
01:58:38,916 --> 01:58:40,832
Tell Vijay, his
sister Shiksha is here...

1456
01:58:40,916 --> 01:58:42,415
Go, come on go!

1457
01:58:44,375 --> 01:58:52,540
Tell Vijay, his
sister Shiksha is here...

1458
01:58:52,583 --> 01:58:54,957
Tell Vijay, his sister
Shiksha is here... Tell Vijay...

1459
01:58:55,583 --> 01:58:57,457
Vijay's sister Shiksha is here?

1460
01:58:57,541 --> 01:59:00,915
Tell Vijay, his
sister Shiksha is here...

1461
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,749
- Shiksha is here.
- Shiksha is here.

1462
01:59:04,625 --> 01:59:05,749
What happened?

1463
01:59:05,833 --> 01:59:07,290
Vijay's sister Shiksha is here?

1464
01:59:07,416 --> 01:59:09,582
Ashatai, Vijay's
sister Shiksha is here?

1465
01:59:14,708 --> 01:59:17,457
Look at how all of
them are staring at you?

1466
01:59:21,291 --> 01:59:22,415
Hey...

1467
01:59:22,708 --> 01:59:23,874
don't be afraid.

1468
01:59:23,958 --> 01:59:25,582
They are all Viju's family.

1469
01:59:25,625 --> 01:59:27,624
Come out. This is my mother.

1470
01:59:30,333 --> 01:59:31,874
Are you really Viju's sister?

1471
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:33,582
Isn't your name, Shiksha?

1472
01:59:33,625 --> 01:59:35,582
Of course, she really is our Shiksha.

1473
01:59:38,958 --> 01:59:40,832
Do you know it is in these
very hands that you were born?

1474
01:59:40,916 --> 01:59:42,540
- She looks exactly like Viju.
- I am...

1475
01:59:42,541 --> 01:59:44,540
- I am Ashatai.
- She has come from a school.

1476
01:59:44,583 --> 01:59:46,540
- You remember, don't you?
- Oh come on Ashatai!

1477
01:59:46,541 --> 01:59:47,582
How will she know?

1478
01:59:47,625 --> 01:59:48,707
Why won't she?

1479
01:59:49,291 --> 01:59:50,582
This is the same lamp post.

1480
01:59:50,708 --> 01:59:52,790
I... I am Lachi, remember?

1481
01:59:52,875 --> 01:59:54,374
Mother, please!

1482
01:59:54,458 --> 01:59:55,832
You remember, right?

1483
01:59:55,916 --> 01:59:58,582
There, she remembers.

1484
02:00:01,583 --> 02:00:02,624
Viju is here...

1485
02:00:18,625 --> 02:00:28,624
EROS

1486
02:00:34,666 --> 02:00:40,915
"There is still somewhere..."

1487
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:46,790
"...some life left in me."

1488
02:00:47,708 --> 02:00:52,874
"I see a new ray of hope."

1489
02:00:53,375 --> 02:00:59,665
"This tells me I am still alive."

1490
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:06,582
"A crushed wish lies
buried in this moment."

1491
02:01:06,666 --> 02:01:13,457
"Where had this moment been?"

1492
02:01:13,541 --> 02:01:19,499
"it's right in front of
me now. Let me feel it."

1493
02:01:19,583 --> 02:01:25,624
"Do I die or live a little?"

1494
02:01:25,916 --> 02:01:32,374
"Do I embrace the
happiness or shed tears?"

1495
02:01:32,541 --> 02:01:38,624
"Do I die or live a little?"

1496
02:02:30,541 --> 02:02:36,624
"A body that was
scorching in the sun...

1497
02:02:37,333 --> 02:02:42,415
has found a shade."

1498
02:02:44,291 --> 02:02:49,707
"As if an miffed child..."

1499
02:02:50,333 --> 02:02:55,624
"...has got his smile back."

1500
02:02:55,958 --> 02:03:01,874
"This is somewhat like
my heart feels now."

1501
02:03:02,541 --> 02:03:09,290
"Feels like my old
wounds have healed."

1502
02:03:15,791 --> 02:03:22,332
"Where had this moment been?"

1503
02:03:22,416 --> 02:03:28,582
"it's right in front of
me now. Let me feel it."

1504
02:03:28,625 --> 02:03:34,957
"Do I die or live a little?"

1505
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:41,582
"Do I embrace the
happiness or shed tears?"

1506
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:48,290
"Do I die or live a little?"

1507
02:03:48,375 --> 02:03:54,582
"Do I embrace the
happiness or shed tears?"

1508
02:03:54,625 --> 02:04:00,790
"Do I die or live a little?"

1509
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,499
Take care.

1510
02:04:06,708 --> 02:04:07,915
Brother, see you.

1511
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,374
When can we meet next?

1512
02:04:09,708 --> 02:04:11,582
Anytime you want to.

1513
02:04:11,916 --> 02:04:13,915
- Day after tomorrow after school.
- OK.

1514
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:15,582
- Here...
- Bye Kaali.

1515
02:04:15,625 --> 02:04:16,749
Bye.

1516
02:04:16,833 --> 02:04:17,957
Take this as well.

1517
02:04:18,375 --> 02:04:19,499
You have everything, don't you?

1518
02:04:26,583 --> 02:04:27,624
Shiksha...

1519
02:04:28,416 --> 02:04:29,957
tell him he should stay for dinner.

1520
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:31,582
I already ate.

1521
02:04:31,875 --> 02:04:32,999
Tell him...

1522
02:04:33,708 --> 02:04:35,540
I know that he hasn't eaten yet.

1523
02:04:57,541 --> 02:04:58,624
Begin.

1524
02:04:59,833 --> 02:05:01,290
And you?

1525
02:05:01,375 --> 02:05:02,499
I'll eat later.

1526
02:05:11,458 --> 02:05:13,832
Brother, you shouldn't
have water while eating.

1527
02:05:15,625 --> 02:05:16,665
Why not?

1528
02:05:17,625 --> 02:05:18,749
What will happen?

1529
02:05:19,791 --> 02:05:20,999
Is it an insult to food?

1530
02:05:21,708 --> 02:05:22,915
It's a blessing...

1531
02:05:23,666 --> 02:05:24,832
that you remember
some things at least...

1532
02:05:29,375 --> 02:05:31,499
Brother... tell me
something about our father.

1533
02:05:31,583 --> 02:05:32,582
Shiksha!

1534
02:05:32,916 --> 02:05:34,582
You shouldn't talk while eating.

1535
02:05:40,541 --> 02:05:42,332
What do you want to know?

1536
02:05:42,416 --> 02:05:43,540
Every little thing!

1537
02:05:43,541 --> 02:05:46,540
Whenever I ask mother,
all she says is...

1538
02:05:46,583 --> 02:05:48,499
father was a teacher in Mandwa.

1539
02:05:48,583 --> 02:05:50,582
And we moved to Mumbai
after he passed away.

1540
02:05:51,625 --> 02:05:53,582
- And...
- That's it!

1541
02:05:53,625 --> 02:05:55,665
Shiksha! Stop talking and eat.

1542
02:06:03,416 --> 02:06:05,624
She is only asking about her father.

1543
02:06:06,958 --> 02:06:08,457
It's not a sin.

1544
02:06:13,791 --> 02:06:17,624
Our father was a self-respecting man.

1545
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:21,624
He was against stealing.

1546
02:06:23,625 --> 02:06:25,332
He was against dishonesty.

1547
02:06:27,583 --> 02:06:28,832
"Fulfill your Karma...

1548
02:06:29,875 --> 02:06:31,582
don't worry about the reward."

1549
02:06:34,458 --> 02:06:36,790
- Life is but a great scene...
- Life is but a great scene.

1550
02:06:38,291 --> 02:06:41,290
That man is walking on.

1551
02:06:41,750 --> 02:06:45,582
- With tears and sweat...
- With tears and sweat.

1552
02:06:46,625 --> 02:06:49,624
- Soaked in blood.
- Soaked in blood.

1553
02:06:53,625 --> 02:06:55,415
And that's how he died.

1554
02:06:57,541 --> 02:06:58,749
With tears and sweat.

1555
02:07:00,500 --> 02:07:03,582
Soaked in blood.

1556
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:06,582
I called you here only to eat.

1557
02:07:07,375 --> 02:07:09,749
And I'm talking about the
man who taught me to eat.

1558
02:07:09,833 --> 02:07:10,957
Viju...

1559
02:07:15,958 --> 02:07:17,582
People spat on him and walked away.

1560
02:07:18,833 --> 02:07:20,290
They said...

1561
02:07:20,791 --> 02:07:23,374
"Master Dinanath's
life was worthless...

1562
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:25,707
and his death a waste."

1563
02:07:28,583 --> 02:07:29,665
The one who walked the path of fire...

1564
02:07:30,541 --> 02:07:32,499
didn't even get fire for his pyre.

1565
02:07:32,583 --> 02:07:39,582
Stop it!

1566
02:07:40,333 --> 02:07:43,332
The only reason I am alive is
to one day honour his death.

1567
02:07:44,625 --> 02:07:47,374
And for last 15 years the
only thing mother has said is...

1568
02:07:47,583 --> 02:07:49,582
stop it, stop it...

1569
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:53,665
Get out of my house!

1570
02:08:58,583 --> 02:08:59,582
Viju...

1571
02:09:02,583 --> 02:09:05,582
Viju, your mother loves you a lot.

1572
02:09:05,625 --> 02:09:07,499
She just doesn't know how to show it.

1573
02:09:10,208 --> 02:09:12,124
My whole life has gone by, Kaali.

1574
02:09:13,750 --> 02:09:16,207
And she hasn't been able
to show her affection yet.

1575
02:09:26,625 --> 02:09:27,749
After all these years...

1576
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:32,790
if she would just give me a hug...

1577
02:09:39,041 --> 02:09:40,499
Look at this, Kaali...

1578
02:09:41,625 --> 02:09:43,082
this is my mother's
love that I hunger for...

1579
02:09:44,625 --> 02:09:46,582
the last fifteen years...

1580
02:09:47,750 --> 02:09:49,040
fifteen years.

1581
02:09:49,791 --> 02:09:55,957
"A pain lies hidden in this moment."

1582
02:09:56,041 --> 02:10:02,582
"Where had this moment been?"

1583
02:10:23,083 --> 02:10:24,874
This time the attack
won't be like in the past.

1584
02:10:25,041 --> 02:10:26,707
A special division has been deputed.

1585
02:10:26,833 --> 02:10:28,582
- Gaitonde will come here himself.
- Of course.

1586
02:10:28,625 --> 02:10:31,915
He has taken the oath of getting rid
of the drug mafia before retiring.

1587
02:10:32,666 --> 02:10:33,915
Nobody can stop him now.

1588
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:36,040
We only have time till
the Ganesh festival.

1589
02:10:36,125 --> 02:10:37,582
The Ganesh festival!

1590
02:10:37,708 --> 02:10:39,582
Praise Lord Ganesh.

1591
02:10:41,958 --> 02:10:45,082
But what role is the great
Ganpati essaying in this Mahabharat.

1592
02:10:47,041 --> 02:10:48,790
Viju... Viju...

1593
02:10:48,958 --> 02:10:51,499
there's someone here to see you.

1594
02:10:51,583 --> 02:10:53,499
Who is it?

1595
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,457
What are you doing here?

1596
02:11:08,541 --> 02:11:12,540
Kancha sir thought
you could use my help.

1597
02:11:13,583 --> 02:11:14,790
And I'm here to help you.

1598
02:11:15,708 --> 02:11:16,874
Listen...

1599
02:11:17,541 --> 02:11:21,665
We have to kill Gaitonde...

1600
02:11:21,750 --> 02:11:25,999
before the Ganesh festival.

1601
02:11:26,875 --> 02:11:28,082
Get it?

1602
02:11:32,833 --> 02:11:35,540
Listen, there's
someone here to see you.

1603
02:11:44,125 --> 02:11:45,582
How are you?

1604
02:11:46,541 --> 02:11:48,832
Forget about Kancha, sir...

1605
02:11:50,416 --> 02:11:51,665
or he will have you killed.

1606
02:11:55,583 --> 02:11:57,915
And he has hired you
to do fulfill this task?

1607
02:12:00,583 --> 02:12:01,749
Aren't you afraid?

1608
02:12:02,541 --> 02:12:03,540
You have a family...

1609
02:12:03,625 --> 02:12:05,832
The day I accepted
the police uniform...

1610
02:12:05,916 --> 02:12:07,624
I let go of fear.

1611
02:12:08,083 --> 02:12:12,499
But I am pleased to see
that you still feel afraid.

1612
02:12:13,583 --> 02:12:14,999
Even though it's for someone else.

1613
02:12:18,458 --> 02:12:19,790
Come now, the pooja is about to begin.

1614
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:36,457
Kancha sir...

1615
02:12:36,791 --> 02:12:38,415
Viju won't kill Gaitonde.

1616
02:12:38,583 --> 02:12:40,457
I saw him leave Gaitonde's house.

1617
02:12:40,708 --> 02:12:44,999
Shall I kill him?

1618
02:13:00,708 --> 02:13:17,540
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1619
02:13:17,583 --> 02:13:22,790
"Anyone who has You in his
heart has fire in his belly."

1620
02:13:23,625 --> 02:13:30,499
"He doesn't care how it
starts and how it ends."

1621
02:13:30,583 --> 02:13:36,707
"The sky and earth call out
and rid him of any evil eye."

1622
02:13:36,791 --> 02:13:43,040
"Ever fear fears the one..."

1623
02:13:43,125 --> 02:13:48,749
"...you protect. Hail Lord Ganesh."

1624
02:13:48,833 --> 02:13:59,082
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1625
02:14:06,250 --> 02:14:16,249
EROS

1626
02:14:45,583 --> 02:14:49,124
"The reward for your reverence."

1627
02:14:49,625 --> 02:14:52,582
"Anyone who earns it is wealthy."

1628
02:14:52,833 --> 02:14:59,415
"Lord, the one who
is unknown to you..."

1629
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:01,874
"...is like a boat without the sail."

1630
02:15:02,625 --> 02:15:05,082
"The rat is your vehicle as such.
You protect everyone."

1631
02:15:05,625 --> 02:15:12,624
"Sins have never been
able to stand up to you."

1632
02:15:12,708 --> 02:15:19,415
"He makes his own destiny."

1633
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:27,540
"The one who devotes himself to you."

1634
02:15:27,666 --> 02:15:31,415
"The one by whom you stand."

1635
02:15:31,500 --> 02:16:01,749
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1636
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:46,540
Name... Vijay Chauhan.

1637
02:16:51,625 --> 02:16:56,124
Vijay Dinanath Chauhan...

1638
02:16:57,083 --> 02:16:58,582
full name.

1639
02:17:02,541 --> 02:17:03,749
Father's name...

1640
02:17:04,541 --> 02:17:05,999
Master...

1641
02:17:06,083 --> 02:17:07,540
Dinanath...

1642
02:17:08,958 --> 02:17:10,499
Chauhan!

1643
02:17:11,791 --> 02:17:12,999
From...

1644
02:17:14,625 --> 02:17:15,832
Village Mandwa.

1645
02:17:30,708 --> 02:17:34,040
"Hail Lord Ganesh."

1646
02:18:26,208 --> 02:18:28,582
Sir, I want to see Mr. Gaitonde.

1647
02:18:28,666 --> 02:18:30,082
He is very busy.

1648
02:18:30,166 --> 02:18:31,582
I'm Vijay Chauhan's mother...

1649
02:18:31,625 --> 02:18:32,832
Suhasini Chauhan.

1650
02:18:32,916 --> 02:18:34,124
Look...

1651
02:18:34,208 --> 02:18:36,749
look, that's Surya from our village.

1652
02:18:36,833 --> 02:18:38,040
From Mandwa.

1653
02:18:39,166 --> 02:18:41,165
That's why it is
critical I see Mr. Gaitonde.

1654
02:18:41,250 --> 02:18:43,707
Alright, I'll inform him.

1655
02:18:44,375 --> 02:18:47,082
Yes... His mother's
name is Suhasini Chauhan.

1656
02:18:47,166 --> 02:18:49,874
She is the wife of some
Master Dinanath Chauhan.

1657
02:18:49,958 --> 02:18:51,124
She is from your village...

1658
02:18:51,208 --> 02:18:52,374
Mandwa.

1659
02:18:52,791 --> 02:18:53,915
Kancha sir?

1660
02:18:54,166 --> 02:18:57,915
Kancha sir? Can your hear me?

1661
02:18:58,416 --> 02:18:59,624
Can your hear me?

1662
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,624
Vijay Chauhan...

1663
02:19:03,291 --> 02:19:05,707
Vijay Dinanath Chauhan...

1664
02:19:08,041 --> 02:19:10,957
Vijay... Dinanath Chauhan...

1665
02:19:11,041 --> 02:19:13,624
He will kill us.

1666
02:19:13,708 --> 02:19:15,582
Kill us all.

1667
02:19:15,666 --> 02:19:16,999
He will kill all of us.

1668
02:19:17,083 --> 02:19:18,749
Remember... we had killed his father?

1669
02:19:18,833 --> 02:19:19,957
We?

1670
02:19:21,625 --> 02:19:24,040
What are you capable
of killing, father?

1671
02:19:25,166 --> 02:19:26,624
You relax, father.

1672
02:19:27,708 --> 02:19:29,582
Save me...

1673
02:19:29,666 --> 02:19:31,332
Just relax, will you.

1674
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,915
Now I shall write the
19th chapter of this story.

1675
02:19:37,666 --> 02:19:39,874
Vijay Dinanath Chauhan...

1676
02:19:41,666 --> 02:19:42,999
must die.

1677
02:19:48,708 --> 02:19:50,290
If people near and far...
if people who are dead...

1678
02:19:50,375 --> 02:19:52,624
the undead... and I, myself,
have cast an evil eye on you.

1679
02:19:52,708 --> 02:19:56,165
Lord, please take the evil away.

1680
02:19:58,250 --> 02:20:00,707
Viju, who cast a black eye on you!

1681
02:20:00,791 --> 02:20:02,040
Take a deep breath.

1682
02:20:04,041 --> 02:20:05,790
Go bring something
to offer Gaitonde sir.

1683
02:20:06,416 --> 02:20:07,624
Quick... hurry up.

1684
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:18,040
I'm sure Surya's body
reminds you of your childhood.

1685
02:20:23,291 --> 02:20:26,082
For the past 15 years I was
taking an aim in the dark...

1686
02:20:26,166 --> 02:20:27,874
and who would've guessed
that the bulls-eye was Mandwa!

1687
02:20:28,625 --> 02:20:29,957
Vijay Chauhan...

1688
02:20:30,708 --> 02:20:32,999
a village teacher's son...

1689
02:20:33,083 --> 02:20:35,082
wants to become the ruler
of the Mumbai underworld.

1690
02:20:35,166 --> 02:20:36,332
But why?

1691
02:20:36,416 --> 02:20:37,707
To carry on his charitable activities?

1692
02:20:38,625 --> 02:20:41,124
Surya's body gave away a
lot of clues about you.

1693
02:20:42,791 --> 02:20:44,624
Ruaf Lala was merely a facilitator.

1694
02:20:45,208 --> 02:20:47,915
Your real goal was Kancha...

1695
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:49,124
Kancha!

1696
02:20:50,375 --> 02:20:51,874
You did save my life...

1697
02:20:52,291 --> 02:20:53,832
but by getting rid of Surya...

1698
02:20:53,916 --> 02:20:55,915
you have wrecked the
fine balance of time itself.

1699
02:20:56,958 --> 02:20:58,332
Kancha won't remain silent.

1700
02:20:59,708 --> 02:21:00,915
More people are set to die.

1701
02:21:01,791 --> 02:21:03,374
It is enough, Vijay!

1702
02:21:04,666 --> 02:21:06,582
You saved my life, that's why...

1703
02:21:06,625 --> 02:21:07,790
In this lifetime, the onus
of repaying your debt...

1704
02:21:07,875 --> 02:21:09,082
is entirely mine, Gaitonde sir.

1705
02:21:10,833 --> 02:21:12,915
You'll have to wait
for another lifetime.

1706
02:21:50,625 --> 02:21:52,207
Gaitonde sir left?

1707
02:21:55,708 --> 02:21:56,999
Even I should leave.

1708
02:21:58,333 --> 02:21:59,915
There's a lot of work to be done.

1709
02:22:00,041 --> 02:22:01,999
To top it all,
Sushila left early today.

1710
02:22:02,708 --> 02:22:03,832
Kaali...

1711
02:22:03,958 --> 02:22:06,415
There's work to be done, I
have to shut the parlour.

1712
02:22:06,625 --> 02:22:15,665
Kaali...

1713
02:22:20,666 --> 02:22:22,040
Kaali!

1714
02:22:27,875 --> 02:22:29,832
I know the time has come...

1715
02:22:30,625 --> 02:22:32,082
for you to leave.

1716
02:22:35,916 --> 02:22:37,207
I get it.

1717
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,582
And I won't stop you.

1718
02:22:40,750 --> 02:22:43,790
Don't you worry about anything.

1719
02:22:44,666 --> 02:22:46,624
I'll take care of
everything in your absence.

1720
02:22:48,666 --> 02:22:50,915
You can even stop worrying
about your mother and Shiksha.

1721
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:54,040
I'll look after Shiksha's
education and even get her married.

1722
02:22:54,708 --> 02:22:56,582
I'll take care of day to day things.

1723
02:22:56,625 --> 02:22:58,249
The beauty parlour is there and..

1724
02:22:58,333 --> 02:23:01,374
I've sort of figured how
to manage the business.

1725
02:23:01,583 --> 02:23:02,624
Go...

1726
02:23:02,708 --> 02:23:03,915
just go...

1727
02:23:10,625 --> 02:23:11,790
Viju.

1728
02:23:13,833 --> 02:23:17,415
I know the place you're going to...

1729
02:23:18,625 --> 02:23:20,874
has your death waiting for you.

1730
02:23:23,333 --> 02:23:24,957
Your mother can see it.

1731
02:23:25,041 --> 02:23:27,415
Gaitonde sir can see it.

1732
02:23:29,250 --> 02:23:30,832
But from where I see it...

1733
02:23:32,625 --> 02:23:34,040
there is nothing...

1734
02:23:36,416 --> 02:23:37,832
but you.

1735
02:23:40,333 --> 02:23:41,624
Only you.

1736
02:23:47,333 --> 02:23:48,624
Therefore...

1737
02:23:49,291 --> 02:23:52,040
the way my life is
and however it is...

1738
02:23:52,916 --> 02:23:54,290
I am fine with it.

1739
02:23:55,750 --> 02:23:58,749
But for now, let me go.

1740
02:24:00,166 --> 02:24:02,832
Please let me go.

1741
02:24:06,625 --> 02:24:07,790
Kaali, wait.

1742
02:24:28,083 --> 02:24:29,249
What?

1743
02:24:29,666 --> 02:24:31,040
Well, this is my wedding fund...

1744
02:24:32,875 --> 02:24:36,624
let's add your fund and
mine and see how much it is...

1745
02:25:04,333 --> 02:25:16,332
"The stars and moon..."

1746
02:25:16,625 --> 02:25:24,624
"...that were always
missing from my sky."

1747
02:25:26,375 --> 02:25:38,582
"You've changed the
course of the clouds."

1748
02:25:38,625 --> 02:25:45,999
"All of them have returned today."

1749
02:26:03,041 --> 02:26:10,582
"My beloved."

1750
02:27:27,166 --> 02:27:28,624
Viju...

1751
02:27:37,166 --> 02:27:51,165
Kaali...

1752
02:27:52,958 --> 02:27:54,832
Please forgive me, Viju...

1753
02:27:55,666 --> 02:27:56,999
Don't go...

1754
02:27:57,958 --> 02:27:59,540
Please don't go...

1755
02:28:00,666 --> 02:28:02,499
I lived my entire life...

1756
02:28:04,458 --> 02:28:06,707
in this one moment.

1757
02:28:21,416 --> 02:28:22,874
Viju...

1758
02:28:46,958 --> 02:28:48,249
Where is my umbrella?

1759
02:28:48,333 --> 02:28:50,790
Kancha sir, Vijay
Chauhan is still alive.

1760
02:28:54,541 --> 02:28:56,124
Vijay Chauhan is alive?

1761
02:28:56,500 --> 02:28:58,290
Vijay Chauhan is still alive?

1762
02:28:58,375 --> 02:28:59,540
You...

1763
02:28:59,625 --> 02:29:01,915
you killed his father.

1764
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:03,165
Now...

1765
02:29:03,291 --> 02:29:04,749
now he will kill your father.

1766
02:29:04,916 --> 02:29:06,499
And he will kill you too.

1767
02:29:06,583 --> 02:29:08,040
Kill you too!

1768
02:29:08,166 --> 02:29:10,082
He won't spare anyone.

1769
02:29:10,166 --> 02:29:11,457
He'll kill everyone.
He will kill everyone.

1770
02:29:11,541 --> 02:29:19,915
He won't spare anyone.

1771
02:29:43,625 --> 02:29:49,582
Kancha sir...

1772
02:29:49,708 --> 02:29:51,832
We found an abandoned
boat near the coast.

1773
02:29:55,875 --> 02:29:58,457
So Lord Ram has set foot on Lanka.

1774
02:29:59,708 --> 02:30:01,082
Go and check if...

1775
02:30:01,250 --> 02:30:03,207
he has also brought an army along.

1776
02:30:03,291 --> 02:30:04,457
Yes sir.

1777
02:30:04,541 --> 02:30:06,582
Come on move it.

1778
02:30:09,458 --> 02:30:11,540
Go quickly and look there.

1779
02:30:12,916 --> 02:30:15,457
Run!

1780
02:30:15,583 --> 02:30:18,165
Kancha sir, there has
been a big blast there!

1781
02:30:18,291 --> 02:30:19,749
Run, save your lives!

1782
02:30:37,666 --> 02:30:40,624
Kancha sir, Mandwa is burning!

1783
02:30:40,750 --> 02:30:43,165
Run, save your lives!

1784
02:30:50,291 --> 02:30:52,374
Your Lanka is burning, Kancha.

1785
02:31:05,333 --> 02:31:08,540
Now go and recreate
a new one from hell.

1786
02:31:21,500 --> 02:31:24,165
You've kept me waiting
a long time, O Lord.

1787
02:31:24,666 --> 02:31:26,374
My eyes have grown weary.

1788
02:31:54,625 --> 02:31:57,040
I'm such an idiot.

1789
02:31:57,666 --> 02:32:02,499
For fifteen years, I've wondered
why the banyan tree withered away.

1790
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:07,665
It's because I hung your father on it.

1791
02:32:17,458 --> 02:32:20,415
Your father's face
reflects in your eyes.

1792
02:32:20,500 --> 02:32:23,249
Your father, he
wanted to change Mandwa.

1793
02:32:23,458 --> 02:32:25,915
He couldn't.

1794
02:32:29,166 --> 02:32:31,207
But I did.

1795
02:32:31,708 --> 02:32:34,249
In fact, you should be grateful to me.

1796
02:32:34,333 --> 02:32:36,499
What are you doing, my son?

1797
02:32:36,583 --> 02:32:37,999
I told you...

1798
02:32:38,083 --> 02:32:39,582
he will kill.

1799
02:32:39,666 --> 02:32:40,999
If he gets up, he will kill.

1800
02:32:41,083 --> 02:32:43,332
Kancha, I told you.

1801
02:32:43,458 --> 02:32:45,040
I told you so!

1802
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:54,582
You are nothing like me.

1803
02:33:55,416 --> 02:33:56,665
How I wish you were!

1804
02:33:57,625 --> 02:33:59,957
No fear, no desire...

1805
02:34:00,291 --> 02:34:02,415
no attachments...

1806
02:34:02,625 --> 02:34:05,665
Just pure bliss.

1807
02:34:18,083 --> 02:34:22,624
But you have attachments and desires.

1808
02:34:23,125 --> 02:34:24,415
Some affection... in you...

1809
02:34:24,541 --> 02:34:26,457
Vijay Dinanath Chauhan.

1810
02:34:38,583 --> 02:34:39,582
Brother...

1811
02:34:39,666 --> 02:34:41,124
Vijay! Vijay!

1812
02:34:41,208 --> 02:34:42,415
Vijay!

1813
02:34:47,291 --> 02:34:48,499
Brother!

1814
02:34:48,583 --> 02:34:49,624
Vijay!

1815
02:34:58,583 --> 02:35:00,999
It's a good thing you
didn't burn my mansion.

1816
02:35:01,583 --> 02:35:04,082
Otherwise just as you've
been mourning for your father...

1817
02:35:04,291 --> 02:35:06,540
you would be mourning for
your mother and sister as well.

1818
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:15,332
Viju!

1819
02:35:15,541 --> 02:35:16,624
Master's wife?

1820
02:35:16,958 --> 02:35:18,540
Hey, she's the master's wife!

1821
02:35:18,583 --> 02:35:20,124
The master's wife!

1822
02:35:20,208 --> 02:35:21,374
Let me go!

1823
02:35:21,458 --> 02:35:22,582
Mother...

1824
02:35:23,708 --> 02:35:25,165
Vijay...

1825
02:35:26,458 --> 02:35:28,582
He is Vijay, the master's son.

1826
02:35:30,583 --> 02:35:32,582
Vengeance after fifteen years.

1827
02:35:32,666 --> 02:35:34,249
Brother!

1828
02:35:34,333 --> 02:35:35,957
And this eerie calm...

1829
02:35:36,041 --> 02:35:37,374
Brother!

1830
02:35:38,708 --> 02:35:42,957
That seems to say a
violent storm is brewing.

1831
02:35:43,083 --> 02:35:45,582
Kancha, spare him.

1832
02:35:45,625 --> 02:35:48,624
The universe is about to explode,
Vijay Chauhan.

1833
02:35:49,250 --> 02:35:51,582
And you will be born again.

1834
02:35:51,625 --> 02:35:56,040
But for that you must
allow death to embrace you.

1835
02:36:01,041 --> 02:36:04,124
No. No. Spare him.

1836
02:36:04,666 --> 02:36:07,040
Somebody help him.

1837
02:36:08,375 --> 02:36:10,582
Somebody please help my son.

1838
02:36:13,041 --> 02:36:15,124
Why are you asking
them for help, mother?

1839
02:36:16,625 --> 02:36:20,624
That night they said nothing
when my father was killed.

1840
02:36:22,208 --> 02:36:23,665
What do you expect them to say now?

1841
02:36:27,291 --> 02:36:28,624
They won't say a word.

1842
02:36:29,458 --> 02:36:32,207
Because they have chosen the devil.

1843
02:36:33,333 --> 02:36:37,957
Now the devil is their
god and also their ruler.

1844
02:36:38,625 --> 02:36:40,665
They have no one else but me.

1845
02:36:41,375 --> 02:36:44,624
So let me fulfill my Karma.

1846
02:36:47,041 --> 02:36:48,457
Brother!

1847
02:36:49,125 --> 02:36:50,582
Viju!

1848
02:37:15,375 --> 02:37:17,457
Save your breath...

1849
02:37:18,583 --> 02:37:20,624
we have to go to the banyan tree.

1850
02:37:37,625 --> 02:37:40,957
Let my brother go!

1851
02:37:47,625 --> 02:37:49,665
Viju...

1852
02:40:07,625 --> 02:40:09,499
Go beat him up!

1853
02:40:09,583 --> 02:40:10,999
Kill them!

1854
02:40:11,083 --> 02:40:26,207
Kill all of them!

1855
02:42:36,041 --> 02:42:38,582
And till you become powerful,
you get beaten up everyday.

1856
02:42:40,291 --> 02:42:41,582
Says who?

1857
02:42:41,583 --> 02:42:43,457
Keep reciting the verse with me.

1858
02:42:43,583 --> 02:42:45,582
I derive my strength from this.

1859
02:42:45,708 --> 02:42:47,582
You shall too.

1860
02:42:50,583 --> 02:42:53,374
There you stand, a tall tree.

1861
02:42:55,041 --> 02:42:57,957
You are well-laden and tall.

1862
02:43:02,083 --> 02:43:06,957
But don't ever ask
for even a little shade.

1863
02:43:09,333 --> 02:43:10,915
Don't ever ask.

1864
02:43:15,166 --> 02:43:16,915
You will never tire

1865
02:43:18,666 --> 02:43:20,624
you will never rest.

1866
02:43:25,541 --> 02:43:27,582
You will never look back.

1867
02:43:29,125 --> 02:43:35,082
Take an oath.

1868
02:43:36,958 --> 02:43:39,332
Life is but a great scene.

1869
02:43:42,583 --> 02:43:45,040
That man is walking on.

1870
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,582
With tears and sweat.

1871
02:43:50,625 --> 02:43:59,165
Soaked in blood.

1872
02:44:00,208 --> 02:44:13,624
On the path of fire.

1873
02:44:42,625 --> 02:44:45,540
Father!

1874
02:45:12,583 --> 02:45:20,624
Viju...

1875
02:45:28,083 --> 02:45:29,582
Mother...

1876
02:45:36,541 --> 02:45:37,624
Brother...

1877
02:45:41,250 --> 02:45:43,332
Mother, I did the right thing?

1878
02:45:46,291 --> 02:45:50,499
Mother, I did the
right thing, didn't I?

1879
02:45:54,916 --> 02:45:59,040
I shall pray to the Lord
that in my next birth...

1880
02:45:59,541 --> 02:46:01,457
I want to be your mother again!

1881
02:46:08,625 --> 02:46:16,415
Brother...

1882
02:46:18,500 --> 02:46:19,624
Mother...

1883
02:47:17,208 --> 02:47:25,624
The path of fire
