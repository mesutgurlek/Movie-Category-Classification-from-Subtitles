Worst thing i've heard in my whole life!

173
00:15:08,988 --> 00:15:10,988
[Tom] Somehow I can't see anything, Rike.

174
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:16,412
[Rike] There isn't anything to see.

175
00:15:16,436 --> 00:15:18,436

[Mr. Meisner] It's no problem, you can hold it.

181
00:16:52,488 --> 00:16:53,988
Hey, what are you doing there!

182

Let's start over again

We can manage the stuff with the notes.

187

You can get it out of your head, Balthasar.

213
00:19:09,756 --> 00:19:11,956
[Balthasar] How do you know my name?

214

Johnny has been dead for at least 30 years.

219

[Johnny] Ghosts can also be dangerous!

220
00:19:28,824 --> 00:19:30,824
[Balthasar] Hehe! I'm sorry.

221

...will come automatically...

[Balthasar] Even if you're right...

232

Millions of people, who hate his guts.

[Fun Fact: The character "Grandpa Winter" is played by this movies producer Peter Schamoni]

[He was amazed at Daniels atmosphere and charisma and decided to make a movie about him]

274

[Producer Schamoni couldn't understand Lommels fascination with Daniel at first...]

275
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:39,844
[... but was soon won over by Daniels positive energy!]

276
00:23:40,868 --> 00:23:49,868
[Thats why he included himself playing the part of  "Grandpa Winter"!]

277

[Marie] No! The opposite!

[Marie] Well, I wouldn't participate, Daniel.

371

You have to remain true to yourself.

372

Only then you can be succesful in Hollywood.

373

487
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:41,001
[Rike] Who are you talking to, Küblböck?
Are you nuts? Are you crazy?

488
00:47:51,325 --> 00:47:53,625
[Daniel] Could I also have a cigarette?

489
00:47:53,949 --> 00:47:56,349
[Rike] Sorry, nothing left.

490
00:48:02,373 --> 00:48:03,373
:-P

491
00:48:12,197 --> 00:48:16,297
[Father] Hello, my dearest audience.
There are technical difficulties.

492
00:48:16,921 --> 00:48:20,321
Nothing dramatic, the show will go on soon

493
00:48:20,345 --> 00:48:22,345
Please be patient.

494
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:26,869
In the meantime time,
the band will serve you music
and keep you entertained.

495
00:48:27,593 --> 00:48:29,993
Thanks for your understanding.

496
00:48:31,317 --> 00:48:33,617
[Petra] You think something
happened to him, Gramps?

497
00:48:33,641 --> 00:48:35,641
[Winter] Why?
What could have happened to him?

498
00:48:35,665 --> 00:48:37,665
Don't worry. Nononono

499
00:48:37,689 --> 00:48:40,189
[Petra] Can't we go backstage and talk to him?

500
00:48:40,213 --> 00:48:43,213
[Winter] Talking? W-w-with wh-wh-who?
Y-you w-wanna talk to him?

501
00:48:43,237 --> 00:48:45,237
[Petra] Why not? Are you still a hater?

502
00:48:45,261 --> 00:48:49,061
[Winter] Nooo, I think hes pretty good.
Better than Heino with his glasses
[Famous german singer]

503
00:48:49,485 --> 00:48:51,485
You think we should....?

504
00:48:54,609 --> 00:48:56,609
Aren't you the father of Küblöck?
[Father] Yeah.

505
00:48:56,633 --> 00:49:00,733
[Winter] I'm the guy from <i>Cafe Winter</i>. The owner.
Tell me, can we help you?

506
00:49:00,757 --> 00:49:05,557
We know Daniel very well, a nice young man.
And you know, he's always buying cake.

507
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:07,781
Huuuuge amounts of cake.

508
00:49:07,805 --> 00:49:11,305
So we thought me may help.
[Father] Very friendly.

509
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:13,829
[Winter] Anything happened?
[Father] No no, it's ok.

510
00:49:14,053 --> 00:49:17,053
[Balth.] I won't come up there to you.
You gotta do it alone

511
00:49:17,077 --> 00:49:19,377
[Tom] What? You bail on us now?

512
00:49:19,401 --> 00:49:21,901
[Balth.] I have nothing to do with it.
It's your business

513
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:23,925
YOU wanted to get famous

514
00:49:24,149 --> 00:49:27,549
Tell me, Balthasar...
Something is funny here...

515
00:49:28,073 --> 00:49:30,573
[Balth.] Funny? Why? What?

516
00:49:30,997 --> 00:49:34,297
[Tom] He put a spell on you, heh?
Right?!

517
00:49:34,321 --> 00:49:36,321
That's it!

518
00:49:36,345 --> 00:49:39,845
[Balth.] Yuck! Bullshit!
Do your part and we will see...

519
00:49:40,169 --> 00:49:43,469
[Tom] He is dangerous, I see...
He's got something...

520
00:49:43,493 --> 00:49:49,093
Slowly i start understanding his fans.
There is something to him...

521
00:50:01,617 --> 00:50:03,617
[Rike] Finally, there you are!

522
00:50:09,341 --> 00:50:12,641
So, turn around.
We make short work with you.

523
00:50:15,065 --> 00:50:19,065
We will put a small pellet in your neck.
Got it?

524
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:24,589
But because we pity you a bit...
we will do it from behind.

525
00:50:24,613 --> 00:50:26,613
So you don't have to watch it.

526
00:50:26,637 --> 00:50:30,137
How many bullets are in here?
-5 or 10, doesn't matter.

527
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:32,161
[Tom] Well, it will be enough.

528
00:50:32,285 --> 00:50:37,785
I shoot...
and you record.

529
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:39,809
[Rike] Ok, no problem!

530
00:50:43,233 --> 00:50:46,633
Dot it, Tommy!
Or should I do it?

531
00:50:46,657 --> 00:50:48,657
[Tom] Ok, if you insist!

532
00:50:48,881 --> 00:50:52,081
I'm better with the camera anyway.
- Coward!

533
00:50:52,605 --> 00:50:56,005
[Tom] Don't be silly, Rike!
[Rike] Loser.

534
00:50:56,029 --> 00:51:00,729
[Tom] Come on, don't put on a show!
What is happening?

535
00:51:01,453 --> 00:51:03,753
You aren't able to stay cool, typical.

536
00:51:03,777 --> 00:51:07,177
[Rike] Tell me Tommy, what are you doing?
What are you fingering around?

537
00:51:08,701 --> 00:51:11,701
[Tom] Something is wrong with the camera.
Did you break it?

538
00:51:15,725 --> 00:51:19,325
[Daniel] At my home all hell always broke lose

539
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:27,449
My mother was drinking.
And I was always taken for a fool.

540
00:51:29,273 --> 00:51:31,673
And my brother was a Neo-Nazi!
- Shit!

541
00:51:31,897 --> 00:51:35,197
[Tom] In my case it was my stepfather,
who always beat me.

542
00:51:35,221 --> 00:51:37,221
Day and night.

543
00:51:37,245 --> 00:51:40,745
But one day I punched back, it felt great.
It was so much fun!

544
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:43,169
[Rike] Here, it's workign again.

545
00:51:43,293 --> 00:51:47,793
[Daniel] I learned one thing in my life.
To NOT punch back.

546
00:51:47,817 --> 00:51:50,317
[Rike] Turn around at last, Küblböck!

547
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:52,641
[Tom] So, camera is running.

548
00:51:52,665 --> 00:51:57,165
It's your turn, Miss Regisseuse.
[Wordplay on Regisseur(director) and the female ending -seuse]

549
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,789
[Rike] The gun is jamming.
Do you wanna try?

550
00:51:59,813 --> 00:52:03,313
[Tom] I'm filming right now!
You do it. Just pull the trigger.

551
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:04,537
:-P

552
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:11,561
I had a guitar once...
an old and broken one.

553
00:52:11,585 --> 00:52:17,585
And they stole it.
I didn't have money to buy one again.

554
00:52:17,609 --> 00:52:19,609
But I would love to play.

555
00:52:21,533 --> 00:52:24,033
[Daniel] I could imagine...

556
00:52:24,257 --> 00:52:29,157
...that you could also dance and sing...
If you wanted to.

557
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:32,781
[Rike] Gosh, am I crazy?
Did you lose your mind, or what is happening?

558
00:52:32,805 --> 00:52:37,805
[Tom] Maybe it's not so bad...
Maybe we should give him one last chance

559
00:52:38,229 --> 00:52:43,229
[Rike] Okay... You know what?
You can do this on your own!

560
00:52:43,253 --> 00:52:45,253
Including all the consequences, okay?

561
00:52:45,277 --> 00:52:47,977
I'm going home,
making myself a nice evening.

562
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:50,401
How about this?
-Not bad!

563
00:52:50,425 --> 00:52:52,425
I didn't ask you for an answer,
Daniel Küblböck.

564
00:52:53,149 --> 00:52:56,449
[Tom] I'm okay with this.
[Rike] Good, that's how we do it, then.

565
00:52:56,473 --> 00:53:02,073
[Rike] And if you kill him, all glory to you.
All alone. Is it fair?

566
00:53:02,697 --> 00:53:05,197
[Daniel] Yeah, that's fair.
[Rike] Shut up!

567
00:53:05,721 --> 00:53:09,821
[Tom] I'll call you later.
[Rike] What's on TV tonight?

568
00:53:09,845 --> 00:53:14,845
<i>Deutschland Sucht Den Superstar</i>
[Germanys version of <i>Americas Idol</i>.
Daniel became famous in it]

569
00:53:14,869 --> 00:53:16,869
[Rike] Very funny, Daniel, really.

570
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,893
[Tom] Yeah, uhm...
I'm gonna call you later, then

571
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:20,417
:-P

572
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:41,641
By the way, I liked that one song
by you quite a bit.

573
00:53:41,665 --> 00:53:43,665
The new one.

574
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:47,789
Such a damn bullshit!

575
00:53:48,313 --> 00:53:51,013
Now I'm stuck in this shit.

576
00:53:56,737 --> 00:54:00,937
[Daniel] How about a deal?
[Tom] A deal?

577
00:54:01,461 --> 00:54:10,961
You let me go... I'll leave...
And will tell no one where I've been.

578
00:54:10,985 --> 00:54:15,885
[Tom] I don't believe you!
[Daniel] Then you have to kill me...

579
00:54:15,909 --> 00:54:17,909
... or run away yourself.

580
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:29,233
[Tom] Things are, how they are.

581
00:54:31,757 --> 00:54:33,757
All shit.

582
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:37,981
And I am the biggest asshole.

583
00:54:40,205 --> 00:54:42,905
I will never achieve something big.

584
00:54:42,929 --> 00:54:46,429
My stepfather always said so,
and he was right.

585
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:50,253
I should have never been born
into this shit world. Never!

586
00:54:52,377 --> 00:54:54,677
[Daniel] Just cry, if you want to.

587
00:54:54,701 --> 00:54:56,901
Boys are allowed to cry.

588
00:55:00,025 --> 00:55:03,025
[Tom] Then please,
get otut of here

589
00:56:28,749 --> 00:56:30,549
Impossible!

590
00:56:30,573 --> 00:56:34,573
[Father] Daniel! Are you crazy?
Where have you been the whole time?

591
00:56:36,897 --> 00:56:39,197
My god, where have you been?

592
00:56:39,221 --> 00:56:41,221
[???]... can't explain.

593
00:58:49,245 --> 00:58:52,245
[All concert footage is real, by the way]

594
01:00:16,269 --> 01:00:18,269
[Petra] <i>Dear Daniel,</i>

595
01:00:19,193 --> 01:00:22,193
<i>Your concert in Passau was wonderful.</i>

01:00:23,117 --> 01:00:25,817
<i>My Grandpa is a big fan of you now, too.</i>

597
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:29,041
<i>And sometimes acts like a teenager again.</i>

598

<i>Thousand times thank you
for the invitation.</i>

599

Yours truly,

600
01:00:34,513 --> 01:00:36,913
Positive energy!

601
01:00:38,537 --> 01:00:43,337
[Winter] Yeah yeah yeah... positive energy.
Well you gotta sleep now.

602
01:00:43,461 --> 01:00:46,961
Positive energy isn't bad,
better than negative energy, heh?

603
01:00:47,085 --> 01:00:49,585
Sleep well, you have school tomorrow.

604
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:52,609
And eh... yeah, 
you need positive energy then, heh?

605
01:00:52,633 --> 01:00:55,733
Sooooo, sleep well then.
-Good night.
-Good night!

606
01:01:12,457 --> 01:01:15,157
[Daniel] And... 
where is my christmas present?

607
01:01:15,481 --> 01:01:18,481
[Johnny] Since when do you 
just think about yourself?

608
01:01:18,805 --> 01:01:22,805
[Daniel] I don't get it.
Didn't I do everything right?

609
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:25,329
Haven't I passed my exam?

610
01:01:25,553 --> 01:01:30,453
[Johnny] You forgot something.
Something very important.

611
01:01:31,877 --> 01:01:37,077
[Daniel] What?
[Johnny] Tom and Rike!

612
01:01:39,801 --> 01:01:42,801
They haven't receiced 
a Christmas gif from you.

613
01:01:43,025 --> 01:01:45,525
[Daniel] A gift from me for them?!

614
01:01:46,449 --> 01:01:52,449
[Johnny] I want you to give them something...
that you like very much.

615
01:01:52,873 --> 01:01:55,873
[Daniel] They wanted to kill me!
[Johnny] Oh yeah, well...

616
01:01:56,897 --> 01:01:59,397
That's a long time ago.

617
01:01:59,421 --> 01:02:01,921
But now you are friends.

618
01:02:03,645 --> 01:02:06,745
[Daniel] I don't know...
you can't really call us friends...

619
01:02:06,769 --> 01:02:09,369
I think you are going a bit far with this!

620
01:02:11,593 --> 01:02:13,593
[Johnny] Not at all!

621
01:02:13,917 --> 01:02:14,117
*sqeak*

622
01:02:16,241 --> 01:02:19,241
You will give them your guitar,
got it?

623
01:02:19,965 --> 01:02:23,965
[Daniel] What?!
My guitar? Never!

624
01:02:25,289 --> 01:02:31,289
[Johnny] Well. Then you are just an
itsy-bitsy tiny wizard apprentice.

625
01:02:32,913 --> 01:02:36,213
[Daniel] Come on... 
I beg you.

626
01:02:36,237 --> 01:02:40,237
[Johnny] A wizard often gives that away,
that he loves most.

627
01:02:41,861 --> 01:02:46,361
And you wanna become a wizard...
a real, big wizard. Right?

628
01:03:26,985 --> 01:03:29,185
I got something for you!

629
01:03:50,209 --> 01:03:51,209
[BEST SCENE EVER]

630
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,833
[Balth.] That was dirty little trick 
of you, Johnny!

631
01:05:40,257 --> 01:05:44,757
And that thing with your arm!
Sometimes you got, sometimes not!

632
01:05:44,781 --> 01:05:48,081
Is that just one more dirty spell,
or is it a prothesis?

633
01:05:50,105 --> 01:05:53,505
[Johnny] You can pick your answer,
whatever you want it to be.

634
01:05:53,529 --> 01:05:58,729
[Balth.] Ok then. Maybe i lost the battle.
But the war isn't over yet!

635
01:05:59,653 --> 01:06:02,653
I'm betting on it!
[Johnny] I wouldn't be so sure about that.

636
01:06:03,577 --> 01:06:07,577
[Balth] You must give him your magic-wand, 
don't you?

637
01:06:08,001 --> 01:06:11,001
[Johnny] Why do you ask?
[Balth.] :-D

638
01:06:12,425 --> 01:06:16,425
Then you will lose your magic power.
Three times cockroach [???]

639
01:06:18,149 --> 01:06:20,149
I know magic well enough for this.

640
01:06:20,173 --> 01:06:25,173
In the corner. Broom broom it has been.
My little Johnny. Then we get rid of you.
[???]

641
01:06:25,297 --> 01:06:30,297
And can the little wizard even handle
his new magic powers?

642
01:06:34,921 --> 01:06:37,221
I doubt it a little.

643
01:06:48,845 --> 01:06:52,845
[Father] What's that?
[Grandma] That's something very special!

644
01:06:53,669 --> 01:06:55,969
[Father] Isn't there a letter with it?

645
01:06:55,993 --> 01:07:00,193
[Daniel] ...from the one-armed.
[Grandma] One-armed?

646
01:07:03,617 --> 01:07:05,617
I only know one one-armed.

647
01:07:06,341 --> 01:07:09,741
It was Grandpa! My husband.
- Exactly!

648
01:07:11,165 --> 01:07:17,165
We first met on Oktoberfest 1965.
I was 16!

649
01:07:19,189 --> 01:07:23,489
He sometimes came to my tent,
where i worked as a waitress.

650
01:07:24,613 --> 01:07:29,113
So I fed him, he couldn't 
do it himself, with one arm only.

651
01:07:30,137 --> 01:07:33,537
And... yeah... well...
I fell in love with him.

652
01:07:34,961 --> 01:07:37,961
[Daniel] And what does he look like, 
Granny?

653
01:07:39,185 --> 01:07:42,185
[Grand.] Well, real dark hair, 
just like you.

654
01:07:42,209 --> 01:07:44,709
And brown eyes.

655
01:07:45,033 --> 01:07:47,933
Have I never shown you the pictures?

656
01:07:48,957 --> 01:07:51,957
Well, probably because
 I still miss him.

657
01:07:52,481 --> 01:07:55,681
I didn't have the heart to show you.

658
01:08:00,905 --> 01:08:03,505
Look. That's him!

659
01:08:07,929 --> 01:08:09,929
Do you like him?

660
01:08:13,553 --> 01:08:16,653
[Daniel] What did you say,
where is he now?

661
01:08:16,677 --> 01:08:21,677
[Grand.] Dead. For along time.
Somewhere in heaven.

662
01:08:27,201 --> 01:08:31,401
[Daniel] In Heaven?
[Grand.] Yeah, in heaven.

663
01:08:38,325 --> 01:08:40,525
[Daniel] Incredible!

664
01:08:41,249 --> 01:08:44,249
[Grand.] So sad you didn't 
get to know each other

665
01:08:46,473 --> 01:08:48,973
[Daniel] Granny, please don't cry.

666
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:57,897
[Grand.] You would have so much fun, 
you two!

667
01:08:59,721 --> 01:09:02,121
Well... that's life!

668
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:12,545
Tell me, do you believe in 
miracles... magic?

669
01:09:16,469 --> 01:09:18,469
[Daniel] Im not sure

670
01:09:21,293 --> 01:09:26,793
[Grand.] What did he look like?
Did he wear a dress-coat and a hat?

671
01:09:28,817 --> 01:09:31,317
And white gloves?

672
01:09:32,341 --> 01:09:34,341
[Daniel] Yes, Granny!

673
01:09:34,365 --> 01:09:38,165
[Grand.] And did he have s silvern 
metal-instrument with him?

674
01:09:39,489 --> 01:09:41,489
[Daniel] Yes, exactly.

675
01:09:45,513 --> 01:09:48,513
Grand.] Then tell him 
greetings from me, next time.

676
01:09:50,037 --> 01:09:54,537
Tell him I love him. 
And I was always loyal.

677
01:09:56,961 --> 01:10:00,461
And now go up and sleep.
And seet dreams!

678
01:10:01,085 --> 01:10:07,085
And with the magic-wand...
It's important...

679
01:10:07,109 --> 01:10:11,809
... you must only
 use it to help others.

680
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,833
But I'm sure he already told you, eh?

681
01:10:15,557 --> 01:10:17,557
You... WIIIIIZAAARD!

682
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:21,481
[Daniel] I will do it, Granny.

683
01:10:22,305 --> 01:10:25,305
[Grand.] This stays a secret, ok?

684
01:10:25,729 --> 01:10:27,729
[Daniel] Deal.

685
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:24,653
[Reporter] We are standing in Cannes, 
Ladies and Gentleman.

686
01:11:24,677 --> 01:11:26,677
In front of the festival palace, 
as you can see.

687
01:11:26,701 --> 01:11:32,201
And here will be premiered 
the movie of Daniel Küblböck.

688
01:11:33,225 --> 01:11:35,625
It's worldwide premiere.

689
01:11:35,649 --> 01:11:37,649
Who would have thought...

690
01:11:57,673 --> 01:12:00,673
[Balth.] Küblböck must die,
KÜBLBÖCK MUST DIE!

691
01:12:00,697 --> 01:12:06,197
[The headlines are based on the real event 
of Daniel crashing into a cucumber-transporter.
He was injured in real life]

692
01:12:16,221 --> 01:12:19,221
[Johnny] You don't need to 
be scared, Daniel.

693
01:13:38,245 --> 01:13:40,945
MY LIFE IS MAGIC!!!
