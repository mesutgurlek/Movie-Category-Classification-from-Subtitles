1
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,100
<b>THE CONSPIRATOR</b>

2
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,434
Two men standing at the Pearly Gates.

3
00:00:59,137 --> 00:01:03,403
The first man says, "How'd you die?"

4
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:06,501
Second says, "I froze to death.

5
00:01:06,544 --> 00:01:08,637
How 'bout you?"

6
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,739
And the, uh, second man says,

7
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:15,151
"Well, I thought my--my wife
was being unfaithful to me,

8
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:17,916
- so I ran all the way home."
- Come on.

9
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,548
"And burst into the bedroom."

10
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:21,580
There's nothin' here.

11
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:22,615
- "She just..."
- Look over there.

12
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,649
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:23,695 --> 00:01:25,595
Make sure there's men on--

14
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,188
Here!

15
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:28,664
We're here!

16
00:01:34,706 --> 00:01:35,798
You take him first.

17
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,102
But, captain, he's as good as--

18
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:38,472
That's an order.

19
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:39,669
Sergeant.

20
00:01:42,113 --> 00:01:44,377
Hey, watch it. Careful. Corporal!

21
00:01:44,415 --> 00:01:46,713
Watch his leg.

22
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:20,907
Hip, hip... Hurrah!

23
00:02:20,952 --> 00:02:23,250
Hip, hip... Hurrah!

24
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:25,755
Hip, hip... Hurrah!

25
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,759
victory!

26
00:02:32,163 --> 00:02:34,358
Getting a little ahead of ourselves,
don't you think?

27
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:37,527
Will, Lee surrendered to Grant,
so have a drink.

28
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:39,559
- Freddie, have you seen him yet?
- A dozen rebel armies still in the field.

29
00:02:39,604 --> 00:02:41,003
I'd say peace is far from in hand.

30
00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:42,903
Hamilton, you could put frost on a fire.

31
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,124
No, I haven't,
but half his cabinet's here.

32
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:48,045
There's Interior... and Postmaster.

33
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:50,544
Treasury.

34
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:51,878
Secretary of Navy.

35
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,611
Where's War?

36
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:55,084
Coh, there he is.

37
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:58,347
God, what I would give to meet him.

38
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,049
What? Wait. Where are you going?

39
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,192
You coming or not?

40
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:04,717
Are you--Are you mad?

41
00:03:04,762 --> 00:03:06,992
You can't approach Edwin Stanton
without an introduction.

42
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:08,259
Really?

43
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:11,064
Frederick Aiken.

44
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:13,627
I've been to Creation and back
lookin' for you.

45
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:15,798
Senator. Uh, Baker, Hamilton,

46
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,207
allow me to introduce the distinguished
senator from Maryland,

47
00:03:19,243 --> 00:03:21,541
- Mr. Reverdy Johnson.
- Great honor, senator.

48
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:23,809
Gentlemen,
you've done this nation proud.

49
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:25,145
Thank you, sir.

50
00:03:25,183 --> 00:03:30,348
Ladies. Ladies, may I present
two genuine war heroes.

51
00:03:30,388 --> 00:03:31,582
Now you all get acquainted

52
00:03:31,622 --> 00:03:34,022
while I introduce the counselor
to some of my,

53
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:35,719
uh, esteemed associates.

54
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,749
- Ladies.
- Hello.

55
00:03:36,794 --> 00:03:37,988
lt's, uh, quite a turnout.

56
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:39,997
- Hello.
- It's an honor to meet the lovely...

57
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:41,726
victory is like shit to flies, Freddie.

58
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,825
Why, Ed, what a delightful surprise.

59
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:47,633
Life's full of them, Reverdy.

60
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:50,300
This is our War secretary,
Mr. Edwin Stanton.

61
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:53,401
Yeah. It's a--it's a very great
pleasure, sir.

62
00:03:53,444 --> 00:03:56,004
Mr. Aiken had two horses
shot from under him

63
00:03:56,047 --> 00:03:57,446
and never quit the field.

64
00:03:59,884 --> 00:04:03,479
Could use a loyal man like you
over at the War Department, Captain.

65
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:04,510
Sir.

66
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:06,420
Captain's back to bein' a lawyer.

67
00:04:06,457 --> 00:04:09,483
Time to heal the nation, Ed,
not wage more war.

68
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:12,091
Pleasure as always, Senator.

69
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:14,620
- Captain.
- Sir.

70
00:04:14,665 --> 00:04:17,498
I'm sorry you won't be able to meet
the president this evening.

71
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:18,729
Will he not be attending?

72
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,033
It seems Mrs. Lincoln
prefers an evening of theater

73
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:23,472
to a room full of soldiers.

74
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:28,879
Anything. I can play anything.

75
00:04:28,913 --> 00:04:29,902
Poor Blind Boy?

76
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:31,278
I don't know that one. Uh, anything--

77
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:32,304
Oh, thank you, Nicholas.

78
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,979
Sarah--oh, my God. You look beautiful.

79
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,544
Sarah, glad to see you.

80
00:04:37,588 --> 00:04:39,681
Fred didn't mention you'd be
joining us this evening.

81
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:42,090
- That sounds like Fred.
- What sounds like Fred?

82
00:04:42,126 --> 00:04:43,684
Nothing you need to worry about.

83
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:46,557
How many bottles is that now, Nick?

84
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:49,293
Uh, nothing you need
to worry about, Fred.

85
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,732
Shall we take a stroll?

86
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:53,995
It's good to have you boys back.

87
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:55,562
It's good to be back.

88
00:04:58,175 --> 00:05:00,541
It's very good to be back.

89
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:10,946
Oh, quite right.

90
00:05:10,988 --> 00:05:15,322
Some gals and their mothers
would look...

91
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:34,541
Mr, vice President.

92
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:35,568
Yes, Senator?

93
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:38,673
I'm sorry to bother you, sir,
but I need your authorization on this.

94
00:05:38,716 --> 00:05:40,843
Is it really necessary right now?
I have so many guests.

95
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:42,045
I'm afraid it's relatively urgent.

96
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:45,522
You have to keep the sun
out of your eyes,

97
00:05:45,556 --> 00:05:47,581
look straight, pull strong,

98
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,614
calculate the distance,

99
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:50,854
and you'll hit the mark every time.

100
00:06:00,237 --> 00:06:02,205
- What?
- Not sure.

101
00:06:05,276 --> 00:06:06,300
Sir?

102
00:06:06,344 --> 00:06:08,471
Yes, I have a package
for Secretary Seward.

103
00:06:08,512 --> 00:06:11,777
We are old friends, Mr. Trenchard,

104
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:13,841
and you needn't be afraid of us.

105
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:15,283
l ain't afraid of you,

106
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:17,617
both of you together.

107
00:06:36,974 --> 00:06:37,998
Want another?

108
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,634
Sir?

109
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,883
Secretary Stanton is a smart man.

110
00:06:52,923 --> 00:06:55,619
The War Department
would be lucky to have you.

111
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,357
It was an honor to meet the man, but...

112
00:06:59,397 --> 00:07:02,093
I'm eager to put the war behind me.

113
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:08,099
You do look awfully handsome
in your uniform.

114
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:13,408
I suppose I'm going
to have to get used to you

115
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:14,604
in civilian clothing again.

116
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,646
So you did miss me?

117
00:07:20,017 --> 00:07:21,678
On occasion.

118
00:07:29,026 --> 00:07:30,960
Now I've no fortune,

119
00:07:30,995 --> 00:07:33,293
but I am filled over with affection

120
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,958
that I am ready to pour over you

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,595
like apple sass over roasted pork.

122
00:07:39,637 --> 00:07:41,628
Mr. Trenchard!

123
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:45,472
You are addressing my daughter,
and in my presence!

124
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:50,139
Yes! I'm offering her my heart
and my hand just as she wants them,

125
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:51,546
with nothing in 'em.

126
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:55,986
Now, I'm aware, Mr. Trenchard,

127
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,251
that you are not used
to the manner of polite--

128
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,028
Pardon me. I'm sor--

129
00:08:16,073 --> 00:08:17,097
Oh.

130
00:08:23,914 --> 00:08:25,745
Shit.

131
00:08:31,422 --> 00:08:32,889
- Oh, no!
- Hold it!

132
00:08:37,728 --> 00:08:39,559
Stop! No!

133
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:41,064
No, please! Don't!

134
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,100
Ohh! Unh!

135
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:46,865
Help!

136
00:08:46,904 --> 00:08:49,634
Somebody help!

137
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:54,644
Help!

138
00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:57,511
...to which you have fallen guilty.

139
00:09:00,785 --> 00:09:05,552
Well, I guess I know enough
to turn you inside out, old gal,

140
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:08,752
you sockdologizing old man-trap--

141
00:09:10,361 --> 00:09:11,555
Ohh!

142
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,167
Sic semper tyrannis!

143
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:26,676
The South is avenged!

144
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,836
He's getting away!

145
00:09:27,878 --> 00:09:29,470
Stop him!

146
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:38,443
Come on.

147
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:39,478
Come on.

148
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:41,115
Come here, you son of a bitch!

149
00:09:41,158 --> 00:09:42,750
Can't get--let you out of here!

150
00:09:52,903 --> 00:09:54,200
What is it?

151
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:57,804
- Major?
- What's happened?

152
00:09:57,842 --> 00:09:58,831
Lincoln's been shot.

153
00:09:58,876 --> 00:10:00,173
- What?
- He's been shot.

154
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:01,701
You stay here.

155
00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:05,211
Open the door.

156
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:06,648
Sergeant.

157
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:07,673
Stand aside.

158
00:10:07,718 --> 00:10:08,707
Over there.

159
00:10:08,752 --> 00:10:10,583
Across the street.

160
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:12,452
Make way!

161
00:10:12,489 --> 00:10:14,081
Please, stand aside.

162
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:15,284
Please.

163
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,818
Move back! Please!

164
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:33,736
- Coming through.
- Olear the way!

165
00:10:33,777 --> 00:10:35,301
Back! Stand aside!

166
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:37,473
Can you see anything?

167
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:43,413
Open the door!

168
00:10:43,454 --> 00:10:45,649
Open the door!

169
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:48,385
Try the other door.

170
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:50,052
Find another way!

171
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,554
Stand aside.

172
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:03,931
Over here!

173
00:11:03,974 --> 00:11:05,737
Over here!

174
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:09,377
Come on inside!

175
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:25,218
Back here. Back here.

176
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,831
Set him down easy.

177
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:35,371
Where's the doctor?

178
00:11:35,406 --> 00:11:36,600
Get some towels.

179
00:11:44,081 --> 00:11:45,378
Mr. Secretary, wait, sir.

180
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,407
No. I want to see him.

181
00:11:48,953 --> 00:11:50,250
Make way!

182
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,223
Out of my way!

183
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:55,316
Move aside!

184
00:11:57,161 --> 00:11:58,958
Out! Move!

185
00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:09,930
- Where is he?
- He's down there, sir.

186
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:11,066
There, sir.

187
00:12:17,781 --> 00:12:19,874
Excuse me, Mr. Secretary.

188
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:21,384
Take his pulse.

189
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:40,170
Mr. Secretary, it was the actor,
John Wilkes Booth.

190
00:12:41,038 --> 00:12:42,733
Are you certain?

191
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:44,536
They've performed with him many times.
They're positive.

192
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:49,835
We haven't done anything wrong.
It's gonna be all right.

193
00:12:50,347 --> 00:12:54,750
Well, one man did not orchestrate
all of this on his own.

194
00:12:54,785 --> 00:12:55,774
Where's Grant?

195
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:57,081
He's on a train to Philadelphia.

196
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:58,611
Bring him to me.

197
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:00,850
I want the commander
of the Union army here.

198
00:13:00,891 --> 00:13:01,915
- Move.
- Yes, sir.

199
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:03,859
Put the forts on alert, all guns manned.

200
00:13:03,894 --> 00:13:06,863
And find out which members of
the Cabinet are still unaccounted for.

201
00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:10,094
Sir, we should move to the
War Department to facilitate operations.

202
00:13:11,902 --> 00:13:14,302
- I'm not leaving him.
- Yes, sir.

203
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:19,598
Damn the rebels.

204
00:13:19,643 --> 00:13:21,543
Damn them all to hell.

205
00:13:21,578 --> 00:13:22,636
Mr. Secretary, sir.

206
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,340
Several names have come up, sir,

207
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:25,780
including an intimate of Booth's,

208
00:13:25,816 --> 00:13:26,805
a John Surratt.

209
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,181
What is known of him?

210
00:13:28,218 --> 00:13:29,617
21 years old, lives here.

211
00:13:29,653 --> 00:13:31,746
His mother runs
a boarding house in town.

212
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:32,778
Find him.

213
00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:34,290
I want the city closed.

214
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:35,621
If any of these assassins

215
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:37,422
get south of the Potomac
or up into Canada,

216
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:38,587
they will never be found.

217
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:39,857
Right away, sir.

218
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:41,990
Also the vice president wishes
to pay his respects.

219
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:44,762
When I say it is safe for him to do so.

220
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:46,394
And keep him away from the liquor.

221
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:47,461
Yes, sir.

222
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,971
Take that woman out,
and do not let her in again.

223
00:14:12,463 --> 00:14:13,760
Let's go.

224
00:14:13,797 --> 00:14:15,856
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

225
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:19,726
Move it!

226
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:21,965
Get up, you!

227
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:23,404
No!

228
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,434
Booth.

229
00:16:34,771 --> 00:16:36,966
That's for the judge to decide.

230
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:39,764
Sir.

231
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,404
Well, nice of you to show, Mr. Aiken.

232
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:44,414
I'm sorry for being late, Senator.

233
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:47,781
You aware the trial of the conspirators
begins today?

234
00:16:47,818 --> 00:16:49,718
Yes, sir. There's not a seat to be had.

235
00:16:49,753 --> 00:16:51,618
Well, now you have one.

236
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:53,345
How's that, sir?

237
00:16:53,724 --> 00:16:54,884
I've taken one of the cases,

238
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:57,223
and I want you to be my second chair.

239
00:16:57,261 --> 00:17:00,230
I thought the government
was planning a military tribunal.

240
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:01,891
Oh, indeed. Stanton has chosen

241
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:06,562
nine of his most loyal officers
to be judges, all for Union.

242
00:17:06,603 --> 00:17:09,970
In fact, he's picked one of Lincoln's
pallbearers to head the Commission.

243
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,235
Uh, let's go.

244
00:17:11,275 --> 00:17:12,572
Uh, I'm sorry, sir.

245
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:14,634
I might be being a little slow,

246
00:17:14,678 --> 00:17:16,111
but won't the War Department

247
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:17,545
be handling the prosecution?

248
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:20,812
Stanton's most trusted
judge advocate general,

249
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:22,819
Joseph Holt, will be in charge.

250
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:24,514
Then what are we to do?

251
00:17:24,554 --> 00:17:26,488
Defend one of the eight.

252
00:17:26,523 --> 00:17:29,788
Defend one of the assassins?

253
00:17:29,826 --> 00:17:32,488
Alleged assassins, counselor.

254
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:34,963
I had a letter
from the lady this morning.

255
00:17:34,998 --> 00:17:37,159
She runs a boarding house, a Mrs. Mary--

256
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,189
Surratt?

257
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:39,293
Yes, that's it.

258
00:17:39,336 --> 00:17:41,304
Sir, her son John
was Booth's right hand.

259
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:45,604
Well, if they suspect her son,
they should try him.

260
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:47,974
They would if they could find him,

261
00:17:48,011 --> 00:17:50,639
but they've got 250 agents
out looking for him.

262
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:53,809
She built the nest
that hatched this plot.

263
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,114
President Johnson said it himself.

264
00:17:56,153 --> 00:17:58,951
Well, I know this goes hard
with you, Freddie,

265
00:17:58,989 --> 00:18:00,286
but--but what they're plannin',

266
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:02,952
which is a military trial of civilians,

267
00:18:02,993 --> 00:18:03,982
is an atrocity.

268
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:06,120
No, no. What she did is an atrocity.

269
00:18:06,163 --> 00:18:07,460
There's no presumption of innocence,

270
00:18:07,497 --> 00:18:10,432
no burden of proof,
no jury of your peers and no appeal.

271
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:12,799
All right, you were one
of Lincoln's pallbearers, too.

272
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:14,497
How can you represent her?

273
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:17,029
She's entitled to a defense, Freddie,

274
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:18,735
so I shall defend her.

275
00:18:57,881 --> 00:19:00,008
Mary E. Surratt,

276
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,019
in aid of the existing armed rebellion
against the United States,

277
00:19:03,053 --> 00:19:07,513
you are charged with having received,
entertained, harbored, concealed,

278
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:10,549
aided and assisted John Wilkes Booth,

279
00:19:10,594 --> 00:19:13,427
John A. Surratt and their confederates--

280
00:19:13,463 --> 00:19:16,591
David E. Herold...

281
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:19,261
Lewis Payne...

282
00:19:19,302 --> 00:19:23,534
George A. Atzerodt...

283
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:25,564
Michael O'Laughlen...

284
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:29,072
Edmund Spangler...

285
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:34,250
Samuel A. Mudd...

286
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:35,979
and Samuel Arnold--

287
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:38,112
in traitorous and murderous conspiracy

288
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:41,090
to kill then-President Abraham Lincoln,

289
00:19:41,124 --> 00:19:42,887
vice President Andrew Johnson

290
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:46,384
and Secretary of State William Seward.

291
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:50,457
Pursuant to special orders
number 211 and 216,

292
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,365
how do you plead?

293
00:19:55,238 --> 00:19:56,796
What say you, madam?

294
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,637
Guilty or not?

295
00:20:02,045 --> 00:20:03,444
I am innocent.

296
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:08,677
In that case, as each of the defendants

297
00:20:08,718 --> 00:20:11,346
has entered a not-guilty plea,
we will begin.

298
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:13,288
Judge Advocate Holt, please proceed.

299
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:16,515
Just a moment, Your Honor.

300
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,926
What is it, Senator?

301
00:20:18,962 --> 00:20:20,930
l--I wish to request an adjournment.

302
00:20:20,964 --> 00:20:23,933
An adjournment? We just got here.

303
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:27,061
My client has been in custody
for a month,

304
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:29,663
wasn't allowed to contact counsel
until yesterday.

305
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:34,939
General Hunter, a delay will only serve
to prolong the nation's sorrow.

306
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:36,138
My learned colleague,

307
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:38,477
you've had over four weeks
to prepare your case,

308
00:20:38,515 --> 00:20:40,813
no doubt assisted by
the entire War Department.

309
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:44,184
I believe the defendant is entitled
to equal consideration.

310
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:45,253
Senator Johnson,

311
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:49,801
our fellow citizens must be
permitted to put this tragedy to rest.

312
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:52,828
The sooner we dispose of this matter,
the better--for everyone.

313
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,990
Everyone but my client.

314
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,697
Judge Advocate Holt, please proceed.

315
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:02,102
In that case, I move for termination.

316
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:03,400
Termination?

317
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,238
On the grounds
this trial is unconstitutional.

318
00:21:06,276 --> 00:21:08,107
The defendant is a civilian

319
00:21:08,144 --> 00:21:11,875
entitled to a public trial
before a jury of her peers.

320
00:21:11,915 --> 00:21:16,477
The attorney general has affirmed
the legitimacy of this proceeding.

321
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,954
Has he furnished a verdict as well?

322
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,985
Senator.

323
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:25,483
You will mind the horror
which summons us.

324
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,895
Indeed.

325
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:30,729
We all mourn the loss of our leader,

326
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:34,464
but in our grief, let us not betray
our betterjudgment

327
00:21:34,504 --> 00:21:36,904
and partake in an inquisition.

328
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,931
Inquisition? How dare you?

329
00:21:38,975 --> 00:21:41,773
Sounds to me like we have
the enemy among us.

330
00:21:41,811 --> 00:21:45,474
Maryland not being among our most loyal
of states during the war,

331
00:21:45,515 --> 00:21:48,575
its senator ought to certify
his allegiance to this court.

332
00:21:48,618 --> 00:21:51,553
I have served this nation
as its attorney general.

333
00:21:51,588 --> 00:21:52,885
That is certification enough.

334
00:21:52,923 --> 00:21:55,084
Nevertheless,
we may require counsel

335
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:58,219
to sign this oath of loyalty

336
00:21:58,261 --> 00:22:00,024
as prescribed by Congress.

337
00:22:00,063 --> 00:22:02,588
I am a member of Congress,

338
00:22:02,632 --> 00:22:05,226
the same body that creates armies,

339
00:22:05,268 --> 00:22:07,998
authorizes military tribunals

340
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:10,905
and makes major generals like you.

341
00:22:10,941 --> 00:22:14,536
Our authorization comes
from the War secretary, Edwin Stanton,

342
00:22:14,578 --> 00:22:16,546
and by order of the president.

343
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,983
If our founding fathers
had desired tyranny to prevail,

344
00:22:21,017 --> 00:22:23,542
the president and his War secretary

345
00:22:23,587 --> 00:22:26,112
would have been granted
such indiscriminate powers,

346
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:28,124
but they drafted a Constitution

347
00:22:28,158 --> 00:22:30,456
with laws against such powers.

348
00:22:30,493 --> 00:22:34,293
They did so precisely
for times like this.

349
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:44,737
Order! Order! Order!

350
00:22:44,774 --> 00:22:47,834
I really want you
to do this for me, Freddie.

351
00:22:47,877 --> 00:22:48,935
You're not serious.

352
00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:51,504
As serious as the charges
against our client.

353
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:53,140
Me? Defend her?

354
00:22:59,356 --> 00:23:00,983
She doesn't stand a chance

355
00:23:01,024 --> 00:23:03,288
with an old Southerner
like me defending her.

356
00:23:03,326 --> 00:23:05,317
She needs a Yankee captain like you.

357
00:23:05,362 --> 00:23:07,523
I'm sorry, sir, I--I can't do it.

358
00:23:07,564 --> 00:23:09,122
No, you'll do fine, son.

359
00:23:09,165 --> 00:23:10,359
Experience matters for nothing

360
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,766
when they're making up the rules
as they go along.

361
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,370
Besides, this government
has never executed a woman.

362
00:23:16,406 --> 00:23:19,375
They've never considered a woman,
nor a man for that matter,

363
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:21,741
capable of murdering the president.

364
00:23:21,778 --> 00:23:24,713
Sir, I can find you a rebel
to defend her,

365
00:23:24,748 --> 00:23:26,682
but I ca--I won't do it.

366
00:23:26,716 --> 00:23:28,616
There is no court in the Union

367
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:31,382
that would fairly judge that woman
with a Confederate counsel.

368
00:23:31,421 --> 00:23:33,048
I won't betray my country.

369
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:35,455
I won't betray my friends
who died defending it.

370
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:38,461
I'm not asking you to betray
your allegiances, Freddie.

371
00:23:38,495 --> 00:23:41,055
I'm simply askin' you--
rather tellin' you--

372
00:23:41,097 --> 00:23:45,500
to obey your oath as a--as an attorney
and do yourjob.

373
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,540
He wants me to represent Mary Surratt.

374
00:23:52,575 --> 00:23:54,406
What?

375
00:23:58,515 --> 00:24:00,107
- What?
- Yeah.

376
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,879
He can't be serious.

377
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,748
They're the actors from the theater.

378
00:25:15,091 --> 00:25:16,115
Open up.

379
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:22,862
Thank you, soldier.

380
00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:24,491
That'll be all.

381
00:25:33,343 --> 00:25:34,810
This conversation is privileged.

382
00:25:35,845 --> 00:25:37,437
Sorry, sir. Orders.

383
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,710
Where is Senator Johnson?

384
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,919
The senator has instructed me
to handle your case.

385
00:25:46,156 --> 00:25:48,124
You understand what you've been
charged with?

386
00:25:48,158 --> 00:25:51,150
Conspiring to murder the president,

387
00:25:51,194 --> 00:25:54,561
secretary of State
and the vice president...

388
00:25:55,698 --> 00:25:58,531
if found guilty, you could hang?

389
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:04,130
No disrespect, Mr...

390
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:06,803
Aiken.

391
00:26:06,843 --> 00:26:08,504
Mr. Aiken.

392
00:26:08,545 --> 00:26:10,604
How many years have you?

393
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:13,838
27.

394
00:26:13,883 --> 00:26:16,784
So you've handled cases
like this before?

395
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,981
There's never been
a case like this before.

396
00:26:19,022 --> 00:26:20,819
But you have defended others.

397
00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:28,559
They've left nothing to chance.

398
00:26:28,598 --> 00:26:29,656
very well.

399
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:34,629
You own a boarding house
on 541 H Street?

400
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:35,660
Is that correct?

401
00:26:35,705 --> 00:26:36,933
Yes.

402
00:26:39,175 --> 00:26:40,267
How long you been there?

403
00:26:42,078 --> 00:26:43,238
Ma'am?

404
00:26:44,347 --> 00:26:47,214
All I know about you
is what I read in the papers.

405
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,274
It's not flattering.

406
00:26:50,854 --> 00:26:54,051
I moved to Washington a year ago

407
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,059
with my son and daughter
after my husband passed.

408
00:26:57,093 --> 00:27:00,995
And the assassins were frequent
visitors to your home.

409
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,294
Yes.

410
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,527
Well, you--heh.

411
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:06,194
You don't even deny
having been acquainted

412
00:27:06,236 --> 00:27:08,295
with John Wilkes Booth
and the others behind bars?

413
00:27:08,338 --> 00:27:10,272
No, sir, I do not.

414
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,979
My husband died a drunk, Mr. Aiken,

415
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:18,810
and left me loads of debt.

416
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:22,511
I had to support my family,
so I rented rooms to boarders.

417
00:27:22,552 --> 00:27:24,383
Those men were customers, nothing more.

418
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,820
And you never considered
their allegiances?

419
00:27:26,856 --> 00:27:29,324
I didn't ask about their allegiances.

420
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:31,156
What about yours, ma'am?

421
00:27:31,194 --> 00:27:33,389
I am a Southerner.

422
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:35,727
I'm a Catholic

423
00:27:35,765 --> 00:27:38,199
and a devoted mother above all else...

424
00:27:40,003 --> 00:27:41,903
but I am no assassin.

425
00:27:41,938 --> 00:27:45,533
Your freedom is gonna require
greater assurances than that.

426
00:27:50,513 --> 00:27:54,244
Then you tell me what I should say
to those generals.

427
00:27:54,284 --> 00:27:55,911
Oh, you can't say a thing.

428
00:27:55,952 --> 00:27:58,750
You're prohibited from testifying
in your own defense.

429
00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:01,450
Perhaps your son could speak for you.

430
00:28:01,491 --> 00:28:03,118
Any idea where he's hiding?

431
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:04,387
No, I don't.

432
00:28:06,396 --> 00:28:10,355
All right. Is there anyone
who will give your version of events?

433
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,300
You mean the truth?

434
00:28:12,335 --> 00:28:15,270
Well, obviously the government
believes your version is not the truth.

435
00:28:15,305 --> 00:28:16,863
Based on what?

436
00:28:16,906 --> 00:28:18,965
They're not releasing
their list of witnesses

437
00:28:19,008 --> 00:28:21,067
or the evidence they'll use against you.

438
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,737
And can they do that?

439
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:24,076
This kind of proceeding,

440
00:28:24,113 --> 00:28:26,104
they can do to you whatever they want.

441
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:27,946
Well, then what difference does it make?

442
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:29,815
Those generals have made up their minds.

443
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:34,656
I can tell by the way they look at me.

444
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:36,420
The way they look at you?

445
00:28:36,459 --> 00:28:40,293
Just the same way you're looking at me.

446
00:28:42,699 --> 00:28:44,462
I have to go.

447
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:49,832
Good day.

448
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:53,570
Mr. Aiken, I haven't a word
from my daughter since I've been here.

449
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:56,635
Would you look in on her for me?

450
00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:58,112
I'd be most grateful.

451
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:00,648
Thank you.

452
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:27,108
Soldier.

453
00:29:27,143 --> 00:29:30,169
Frederick Aiken, lawyer to Mary Surratt.

454
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,409
It's perfect.

455
00:30:11,454 --> 00:30:12,478
Pardon?

456
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:16,518
Anna Surratt?

457
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,254
My name is Frederick Aiken.

458
00:30:18,294 --> 00:30:19,727
I'm representing your mother.

459
00:30:19,762 --> 00:30:22,492
What's perfect?

460
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:25,189
Uh, nothing.

461
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:27,794
No, do tell.

462
00:30:27,837 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm sure I've heard much worse.

463
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,373
Well, I was just thinking
that this would be the perfect place

464
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,105
to conspire to overthrow the government.

465
00:30:36,145 --> 00:30:38,170
No one would ever suspect.

466
00:30:39,816 --> 00:30:41,306
Right?

467
00:30:42,385 --> 00:30:43,374
You alone here?

468
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:44,750
Yes.

469
00:30:45,822 --> 00:30:48,814
Why? Are you afraid to be seen with me?

470
00:30:50,393 --> 00:30:53,123
Your mother asked that I look in on you.

471
00:30:55,164 --> 00:30:56,495
Please tell her not to worry,

472
00:30:57,467 --> 00:31:00,061
since I'm a prisoner in my own house.

473
00:31:00,937 --> 00:31:01,926
Where's your brother's room?

474
00:31:01,971 --> 00:31:03,734
Second floor, on the left.

475
00:32:25,321 --> 00:32:27,983
Did you find what you were looking for?

476
00:32:30,693 --> 00:32:31,819
Uh, yes.

477
00:32:31,861 --> 00:32:34,830
Did your brother share a room
with an L.J.W.?

478
00:32:34,864 --> 00:32:36,593
Louis J. Weichmann.

479
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,496
He was like a son to my mother.
He'll swear she's innocent.

480
00:32:40,536 --> 00:32:41,969
I suppose he's disappeared, too.

481
00:32:44,807 --> 00:32:47,867
Did you fight in the war, Mr. Aiken?

482
00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:53,076
Kill any on our side?

483
00:32:55,218 --> 00:32:56,617
Miss, do you have any documents

484
00:32:56,652 --> 00:32:59,644
indicating who stayed here
or a ledger of accounts?

485
00:33:02,925 --> 00:33:05,689
Do you want me to help
your mother or not?

486
00:33:18,741 --> 00:33:21,039
Is there anything else
you're concealing?

487
00:33:21,077 --> 00:33:22,169
Such as?

488
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:23,872
Your brother, to start.
Look, if you know--

489
00:33:34,257 --> 00:33:36,225
Did you see who threw that?

490
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:37,283
No, sir.

491
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:44,532
Are you hurt?

492
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:45,761
I'm fine.

493
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,937
Mr. Aiken, if you have no further
need of me...

494
00:34:20,036 --> 00:34:23,267
Here. I'll give you two to sell.

495
00:34:23,306 --> 00:34:25,365
You have the latest on this one?

496
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,670
That, I'll take two.

497
00:34:27,843 --> 00:34:29,572
Cigars! Jars!

498
00:34:29,612 --> 00:34:31,580
Picture frames!

499
00:34:31,614 --> 00:34:33,241
Original, right here, ma'am.

500
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:35,716
Who wants a cigar?

501
00:34:35,751 --> 00:34:37,446
Fresh roasted nuts here.

502
00:34:37,486 --> 00:34:38,714
Fresh roasted nuts.

503
00:34:50,032 --> 00:34:52,523
Move along. Mustn't keep it blocked.

504
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:53,865
Thank you very much.

505
00:34:53,903 --> 00:34:54,927
Left.

506
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,437
Left, right, left.

507
00:34:56,472 --> 00:34:57,803
- Cigars!
- Left...

508
00:35:00,943 --> 00:35:02,001
Cigars!

509
00:35:02,044 --> 00:35:04,672
Left. Left. Left.

510
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:06,614
Left, right, left.

511
00:35:06,649 --> 00:35:08,207
Left...

512
00:35:09,518 --> 00:35:11,816
Company, arms rest.

513
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:13,685
- March.
- Shoulder arms.

514
00:35:13,723 --> 00:35:16,021
Quick step.

515
00:35:16,058 --> 00:35:18,458
Left.

516
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:19,688
Left, right, left.

517
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:21,993
A chance to get it back?

518
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:29,027
There he is.

519
00:35:29,071 --> 00:35:30,470
- Fred.
- Hey.

520
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:33,100
Hamilton here has offered
to be your second chair.

521
00:35:33,142 --> 00:35:35,133
Oh. Re--Not a chance in hell.

522
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:36,735
- No? You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

523
00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:38,110
I'll carry his briefcase, but I'm not--

524
00:35:42,718 --> 00:35:44,413
- Sarah.
- Fred.

525
00:35:44,453 --> 00:35:45,750
Why are you here?

526
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:48,687
I'm trying to understand
why you're here.

527
00:35:52,828 --> 00:35:55,319
I suppose I should wish you luck.

528
00:36:05,274 --> 00:36:06,707
Come to order.

529
00:36:08,577 --> 00:36:10,204
How is Anna, Mr. Aiken?

530
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:11,270
She's fine...

531
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:15,039
looking forward to when you come home.

532
00:36:18,454 --> 00:36:21,821
That's very nice
of you to say, Mr. Aiken.

533
00:36:21,857 --> 00:36:25,725
Judge Advocate Holt,
will you please proceed?

534
00:36:26,762 --> 00:36:28,730
In the matter of Mary Surratt,

535
00:36:28,764 --> 00:36:32,200
the prosecution calls as
its first witness Mr. Louis Weichmann.

536
00:36:44,547 --> 00:36:46,572
I thought he was like family.
Why are they calling him?

537
00:36:46,615 --> 00:36:47,604
Place your right hand on this Bible.

538
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,639
I don't know.

539
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:50,584
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

540
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:52,746
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God?

541
00:36:52,788 --> 00:36:53,777
I do.

542
00:36:53,823 --> 00:36:54,847
Please.

543
00:36:58,093 --> 00:37:01,290
Are you acquainted with the defendant,
Mary Surratt?

544
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,355
Yes. Yes, I am.

545
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:06,163
I attended Divinity College
with her son John.

546
00:37:06,202 --> 00:37:07,328
And until recently,

547
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:08,961
you resided at the boarding house

548
00:37:09,004 --> 00:37:10,869
owned by Mary Surratt. Is that correct?

549
00:37:10,906 --> 00:37:12,703
That is correct, sir.

550
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:18,403
Were any of these men
ever present in her home?

551
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:19,744
Yes, sir.

552
00:37:19,782 --> 00:37:21,545
These three over there

553
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:24,644
on several occasions.

554
00:37:25,688 --> 00:37:28,657
Let the record reflect
that the witness has identified

555
00:37:28,691 --> 00:37:32,183
the prisoners Herold,
Payne and Atzerodt.

556
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:37,759
And who invited these men?

557
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,062
John Surratt.

558
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:40,125
Objection.

559
00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:42,330
Objection?

560
00:37:42,371 --> 00:37:45,067
Uh, uh...

561
00:37:45,107 --> 00:37:47,132
There's no way to prove
that John Surratt

562
00:37:47,176 --> 00:37:49,440
even knew these men,
let alone invited them.

563
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,041
Mr. Surratt's absence
from this proceeding

564
00:37:53,082 --> 00:37:55,573
is Mr. Surratt's problem.

565
00:37:55,618 --> 00:37:57,813
Objection overruled. Continue, Mr. Holt.

566
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:04,421
Was John Wilkes Booth
also a frequent guest of John Surratt?

567
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,724
Indeed,
but all the Surratts adored him--

568
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:09,322
John, his sister Anna
and their mother, too.

569
00:38:09,365 --> 00:38:10,992
And were there ever meetings

570
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:13,763
held at the boarding house
involving Mr. Booth?

571
00:38:13,802 --> 00:38:17,568
Many, sometimes lasting two, three hours

572
00:38:17,606 --> 00:38:20,336
and always in secret,
behind closed doors.

573
00:38:22,011 --> 00:38:24,309
And did you ever see Mary Surratt

574
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:26,507
object to these, uh, meetings?

575
00:38:26,549 --> 00:38:27,948
No, sir.

576
00:38:27,983 --> 00:38:30,850
Or to the presence of those men?

577
00:38:30,886 --> 00:38:31,944
No, she did not.

578
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:36,123
- Thank you.
- She appeared to welcome them.

579
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:39,323
Thank you. That'll be all,
Mr. Weichmann.

580
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:14,829
How long did you say these
secret meetings lasted?

581
00:39:14,863 --> 00:39:18,094
At least two, three hours.

582
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:19,657
You were timing them?

583
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,438
Eh, if you were timing them,

584
00:39:23,472 --> 00:39:25,770
I suppose these secret meetings

585
00:39:25,808 --> 00:39:28,436
were not, in fact, kept secret from you.

586
00:39:28,477 --> 00:39:29,705
I knew about them, sir,

587
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:32,213
but I had no knowledge
of what they were about.

588
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:35,842
And that is because you never attended
any yourself, correct?

589
00:39:35,884 --> 00:39:37,647
Exactly.

590
00:39:39,688 --> 00:39:41,178
Why was that?

591
00:39:41,223 --> 00:39:43,248
I thought them suspicious.

592
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:44,691
Suspicious?

593
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:47,594
Well, then, you see, you did know
what they were about.

594
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,565
No, sir, I did not.

595
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:54,567
Then why were your suspicions aroused?

596
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:56,195
By the snatches of rebel conversation

597
00:39:56,238 --> 00:39:59,173
I overheard in the hallways
and by their frequent whisperings.

598
00:40:00,142 --> 00:40:03,077
Well, in that case, if it was
of such great concern to you,

599
00:40:03,112 --> 00:40:07,014
why did you not report your suspicions
to your superiors at the War Department?

600
00:40:07,049 --> 00:40:08,448
I did.

601
00:40:08,484 --> 00:40:09,473
Excuse me?

602
00:40:09,518 --> 00:40:10,849
I did reveal my suspicions.

603
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:14,253
I made a confidant of Captain Gleason
in the War Department.

604
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:26,029
Mr. Aiken, if there's nothing else...

605
00:40:28,704 --> 00:40:30,934
Counselor, will that be all?

606
00:40:32,107 --> 00:40:33,096
Uh, yes.

607
00:40:33,142 --> 00:40:34,575
Uh, no.

608
00:40:36,078 --> 00:40:38,706
No. No, I do have something else.

609
00:40:42,384 --> 00:40:45,444
Tell me, Mr. Weichmann. Tell us all.

610
00:40:46,188 --> 00:40:47,917
- You ever been in Richmond?
- Objection.

611
00:40:47,956 --> 00:40:49,753
I merely wish to know if the witness

612
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:52,124
has ever visited the capital
of the Confederacy.

613
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:54,061
I don't recall.

614
00:40:54,096 --> 00:40:57,497
Then perhaps this train receipt
will refresh your memory.

615
00:40:57,533 --> 00:40:59,398
It indicates passage to Richmond,

616
00:40:59,435 --> 00:41:02,302
and it has your initials on it.

617
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:05,266
Yes.

618
00:41:05,307 --> 00:41:06,331
That's right.

619
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:11,974
I considered continuing my divinity
studies there after the war.

620
00:41:12,014 --> 00:41:13,982
I plan on becoming a priest.

621
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:15,244
That's very nice.

622
00:41:15,284 --> 00:41:17,252
Do you recall, Mr. Weichmann,

623
00:41:17,286 --> 00:41:21,154
at which institute in Richmond
you were thinking of enrolling?

624
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,179
The name?

625
00:41:22,224 --> 00:41:23,555
Yes, Mr. Weichmann, the name.

626
00:41:23,592 --> 00:41:24,684
Well, uh--

627
00:41:24,727 --> 00:41:26,456
- There is no academy of the kind...
- Objection.

628
00:41:26,495 --> 00:41:27,860
...in Richmond, is there, Mr. Weichmann?

629
00:41:27,896 --> 00:41:29,761
- In fact, perhaps you visited Richmond...
- Objection, General.

630
00:41:29,798 --> 00:41:31,095
...for another purpose entirely.

631
00:41:31,133 --> 00:41:32,293
Objection sustained.

632
00:41:34,903 --> 00:41:38,134
You worked for the general in charge
of rebel prisoners, did you not?

633
00:41:38,173 --> 00:41:39,299
Yes.

634
00:41:39,341 --> 00:41:40,365
So?

635
00:41:40,409 --> 00:41:44,846
Perhaps a distinguished clerk
like yourself knew certain information.

636
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,370
What sort of information?

637
00:41:46,415 --> 00:41:49,248
Information that might have been
of divine interest

638
00:41:49,284 --> 00:41:51,809
to certain rebels within the capital
of the Confederacy.

639
00:41:51,854 --> 00:41:52,843
Objection, General.

640
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:54,719
The witness is not on trial here.

641
00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:56,281
Well, he ought to be!

642
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,383
Objection sustained.

643
00:41:58,427 --> 00:42:00,019
The witness is not on trial.

644
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:03,361
Sir, I am merely trying to establish
the witness' credibility

645
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:06,333
or rather the lack of credibility
of this man.

646
00:42:06,368 --> 00:42:09,428
Mr. Aiken, you are incriminating
the witness.

647
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:10,665
Incriminating? Sir,

648
00:42:10,706 --> 00:42:13,334
Louis Weichmann shared a room
with John Surratt.

649
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,935
I have a ticket that puts him
in Richmond.

650
00:42:15,978 --> 00:42:17,707
I think it reasonable to assume

651
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:20,408
that he knows more about this plot
to assassinate our president

652
00:42:20,449 --> 00:42:22,007
than he supposedly reported.

653
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:24,484
What Mr. Aiken thinks
is entirely immaterial.

654
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,149
Counselor, unless you have something
more relevant to ask,

655
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,817
the witness will step down.

656
00:42:29,858 --> 00:42:30,984
No.

657
00:42:31,026 --> 00:42:35,156
No, I have nothing more...
relevant to ask.

658
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:55,648
You never--you never ask a question

659
00:42:55,684 --> 00:42:56,673
you don't know the answer to.

660
00:42:56,718 --> 00:42:57,878
I know. I know.

661
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,787
How--How did you know Weichmann
was lying about Richmond, Fred?

662
00:43:00,823 --> 00:43:02,450
- I didn't.
- You didn't?

663
00:43:03,992 --> 00:43:05,584
S-so you gambled twice?

664
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:07,527
How did you pass the bar?

665
00:43:07,563 --> 00:43:09,622
Well, Will, it worked.

666
00:43:09,665 --> 00:43:13,032
I mean, Fred made Weichmann
look as guilty as the others.

667
00:43:13,068 --> 00:43:14,729
- It was perfect.
- You're right.

668
00:43:15,604 --> 00:43:17,538
And that's the problem.

669
00:43:18,674 --> 00:43:20,073
They all look guilty.

670
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:21,234
Freddie, I'm sorry.

671
00:43:21,276 --> 00:43:23,471
First the senator drops your client
like a load,

672
00:43:23,512 --> 00:43:25,878
and then with all these
secret meetings taking place,

673
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:27,945
either she knew what was going on...

674
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:30,247
Or she damn well should have known.

675
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:38,649
Senator?

676
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:40,389
In here.

677
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:51,068
I think she's as guilty as Booth.

678
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:53,097
How could I possibly defend her?

679
00:43:54,776 --> 00:43:58,212
You assume that she's guilty,
like the Commission.

680
00:43:58,247 --> 00:43:59,908
You don't have any proof.

681
00:43:59,948 --> 00:44:01,074
Proof or no,

682
00:44:01,984 --> 00:44:03,781
don't give a damn what happens to her.

683
00:44:08,156 --> 00:44:09,453
I tell you what.

684
00:44:09,491 --> 00:44:12,483
If you can prove that she's guilty,

685
00:44:12,527 --> 00:44:14,825
you can take yourself off the case.

686
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:16,490
Thank you, sir.

687
00:44:16,531 --> 00:44:19,193
You think it'll be that easy?

688
00:44:19,234 --> 00:44:20,667
I know it.

689
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:33,344
Pardon me, Father.

690
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:35,646
I wish to confer with the prisoner.

691
00:44:35,684 --> 00:44:38,482
Alone, if you don't mind.

692
00:44:39,554 --> 00:44:41,317
It's--It's quite all right, Mary.

693
00:44:41,356 --> 00:44:42,983
I--I must be going anyway.

694
00:44:43,025 --> 00:44:45,653
All right. Well, thank you
for visiting, Father.

695
00:44:45,694 --> 00:44:47,594
I'll see you soon.

696
00:44:47,629 --> 00:44:50,029
Your words were most comforting.

697
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:51,430
The Lord's with you.

698
00:44:59,207 --> 00:45:02,370
She's refusing to eat.

699
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:05,608
I've tried to convince her to no avail.

700
00:45:05,647 --> 00:45:08,480
Perhaps you could help her.

701
00:45:14,489 --> 00:45:16,457
"Search me, and know my heart.

702
00:45:16,491 --> 00:45:18,659
"Try me, and know my thoughts.

703
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:21,593
And see
if there be any wicked way in me."

704
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,468
"The Lord knows the way of the wicked.

705
00:45:27,502 --> 00:45:29,265
And the way of the wicked will perish."

706
00:45:29,304 --> 00:45:31,636
You know your Proverbs, young man.

707
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,141
My father was a minister.

708
00:45:34,176 --> 00:45:36,110
He taught them to me as a child.

709
00:45:39,681 --> 00:45:43,515
So, what is it you wish to know?

710
00:45:43,552 --> 00:45:46,680
Why Booth and his associates
were constants in your home.

711
00:45:46,722 --> 00:45:49,247
I ran a boarding house, Mr. Aiken.

712
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:52,590
Forgive me if I chose
to fill it with boarders.

713
00:45:52,627 --> 00:45:54,288
I checked your registry, ma'am.

714
00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:57,025
There's no record Booth ever
stayed at your home.

715
00:45:57,065 --> 00:46:00,694
No, the fact is he stayed at the
National whenever he came to Washington,

716
00:46:00,736 --> 00:46:03,728
so why was Booth in your home?

717
00:46:03,772 --> 00:46:07,071
I suppose my son invited him.
They were friends.

718
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:09,270
Famous actor like Booth?

719
00:46:09,311 --> 00:46:11,302
Engaging your son out of friendship?

720
00:46:11,346 --> 00:46:14,679
Mr. Aiken, my son is no less
a gentleman than you

721
00:46:14,716 --> 00:46:18,174
and very capable of forming
acquaintances in society.

722
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,451
I've--I've read all about
your family's acquaintances, ma'am,

723
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:26,450
about how your late husband contributed
to the Confederate cause

724
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:28,326
and about your Gentleman Johnny.

725
00:46:28,363 --> 00:46:30,263
What about him?

726
00:46:30,298 --> 00:46:32,507
He made quite a sum as a courier

727
00:46:32,654 --> 00:46:35,292
carrying rebel secrets
across Union lines.

728
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:37,100
Oh, I'm well aware

729
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:39,767
of what your family's capable of,
Mrs. Surratt,

730
00:46:39,808 --> 00:46:43,574
so I know you're not
telling me the truth.

731
00:46:43,612 --> 00:46:46,046
Well, then you know what I do not.

732
00:46:46,081 --> 00:46:48,345
You were despondent over losing the war,

733
00:46:48,383 --> 00:46:51,352
and you would have done anything
you could to save the Confederacy,

734
00:46:51,386 --> 00:46:52,876
including using your own son John.

735
00:46:52,921 --> 00:46:54,149
Honestly, Mr. Aiken.

736
00:46:54,189 --> 00:46:56,453
So you arranged a meeting with Booth,

737
00:46:56,491 --> 00:46:58,550
figuring he'd befriend your son
because of what he knew,

738
00:46:58,593 --> 00:47:00,026
what expert couriers do know.

739
00:47:00,062 --> 00:47:02,462
And what might that be?

740
00:47:02,497 --> 00:47:04,590
The best escape routes out of town.

741
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:09,532
Your son was supposed to lead the others
to freedom that night, wasn't he?

742
00:47:09,571 --> 00:47:11,664
Except he was the only one
that got away.

743
00:47:12,774 --> 00:47:14,833
My son was in Canada that day.

744
00:47:14,876 --> 00:47:16,173
Can you prove that?

745
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:19,078
I received a letter on April 14,

746
00:47:19,114 --> 00:47:22,550
same day as the assassination,

747
00:47:22,584 --> 00:47:24,313
sent from Montreal.

748
00:47:24,352 --> 00:47:26,343
Where is this letter?

749
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:27,946
I don't know.

750
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:29,820
I'm done,

751
00:47:29,858 --> 00:47:31,155
done defending your lies.

752
00:47:31,193 --> 00:47:33,457
You're so blind with hatred, Mr. Aiken,

753
00:47:33,495 --> 00:47:34,894
you can't even see the truth.

754
00:47:35,931 --> 00:47:38,559
Yes, my son hated the North.
We all did.

755
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,400
How can a Southerner feel anything
but bitterness toward your side?

756
00:47:42,437 --> 00:47:45,406
But my son did not conspire
to kill your president.

757
00:47:46,274 --> 00:47:47,935
He conspired to kidnap him.

758
00:47:55,283 --> 00:47:58,650
All right, here he comes.

759
00:47:58,687 --> 00:48:00,587
Ready your mount.

760
00:48:01,623 --> 00:48:03,250
Surratt, where the hell's Booth?

761
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:04,815
He'll be here.

762
00:48:07,863 --> 00:48:10,229
All right, steady.

763
00:48:14,569 --> 00:48:15,934
Wait!

764
00:48:17,005 --> 00:48:19,269
He's not coming!

765
00:48:20,475 --> 00:48:22,136
Lincoln's changed his plans.

766
00:48:22,177 --> 00:48:23,940
- What?
- He's still in town.

767
00:48:23,979 --> 00:48:26,072
He just gave a speech at the National.

768
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,221
Anna, back upstairs.

769
00:48:50,505 --> 00:48:52,200
Who was in the carriage?

770
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,141
Doesn't matter. What matters
is he wasn't in the carriage.

771
00:48:55,177 --> 00:48:56,166
You should have known.

772
00:48:56,211 --> 00:48:57,200
What about the weapons?

773
00:48:57,245 --> 00:48:58,473
We need to hide these weapons.

774
00:48:58,513 --> 00:48:59,707
We can take them to Lloyd's.

775
00:48:59,748 --> 00:49:00,737
I'll take 'em.

776
00:49:00,782 --> 00:49:02,272
You'd shoot your own foot off.

777
00:49:02,317 --> 00:49:03,341
I said I'd do it.

778
00:49:03,385 --> 00:49:04,477
Don't push me.

779
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:06,111
Enough!

780
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:09,351
Fools like you are the reason
we can lose this fight.

781
00:49:17,098 --> 00:49:21,125
Johnny Surratt,
I'd like a word with you, please.

782
00:49:21,169 --> 00:49:23,160
Well, answer, Johnny.
Your mama's callin'.

783
00:49:26,408 --> 00:49:29,434
They planned on ransoming
Lincoln in exchange

784
00:49:29,477 --> 00:49:32,503
for all the Confederate soldiers
in your prisons.

785
00:49:32,547 --> 00:49:34,071
Why didn't you report them
to the authorities?

786
00:49:34,115 --> 00:49:36,675
Because one of them was my son.

787
00:49:36,718 --> 00:49:37,946
So rather than kidnap him,

788
00:49:37,986 --> 00:49:39,681
your son helped murder
the president instead.

789
00:49:39,721 --> 00:49:40,710
No.

790
00:49:40,755 --> 00:49:43,622
They nearly got the vice president
and the secretary of State.

791
00:49:43,658 --> 00:49:45,182
No, it's not true. It's not my Johnny.

792
00:49:45,227 --> 00:49:47,422
Damn it, ma'am, you just said
he was Booth's right hand.

793
00:49:47,462 --> 00:49:50,090
My son is not a murderer, Mr. Aiken.

794
00:49:50,131 --> 00:49:51,996
All right, then.

795
00:49:52,033 --> 00:49:53,625
Swear to it.

796
00:49:57,772 --> 00:49:59,797
Supper will be ready shortly.

797
00:50:01,243 --> 00:50:02,267
John?

798
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:04,369
Can't stay, mama.

799
00:50:04,412 --> 00:50:06,505
I have to leave town straightaway.

800
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:07,879
What's so pressing?

801
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:09,611
Nothing that need worry you.

802
00:50:09,651 --> 00:50:12,381
Just some cotton speculatin'.
That's all.

803
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,547
Don't sport with me, son.

804
00:50:14,589 --> 00:50:16,648
You're not steppin' outside this house.

805
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:18,682
Don't talk to me like I'm a child!

806
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:21,127
Richmond's falling.
Something must be done.

807
00:50:21,162 --> 00:50:24,325
Johnny, I'm aware of the news
from Richmond,

808
00:50:24,366 --> 00:50:26,334
and it pains me terribly.

809
00:50:26,368 --> 00:50:27,426
Supper's ready.

810
00:50:27,469 --> 00:50:30,370
Wh-what is it?

811
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:31,394
I'm leaving town.

812
00:50:31,439 --> 00:50:32,872
No, you're not leaving town.

813
00:50:32,907 --> 00:50:33,896
Yes, I am.

814
00:50:33,942 --> 00:50:35,569
You and Anna are the only family
I've got left,

815
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:38,170
and I'll be damned if I let you go out
there and do something else foolish.

816
00:50:38,213 --> 00:50:39,339
- Foolish?
- Johnny--

817
00:50:39,381 --> 00:50:41,576
What I'm fightin' for is far
more important than any of us.

818
00:50:41,616 --> 00:50:43,345
Your family is more important
than anything.

819
00:50:43,385 --> 00:50:44,511
That is your responsibility!

820
00:50:44,552 --> 00:50:47,578
All of our men are buried underground
right now.

821
00:50:47,622 --> 00:50:49,055
- The war is over.
- Oh, you're wrong about that.

822
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:50,523
There is nothing left for you to do.

823
00:50:50,558 --> 00:50:52,355
The war is far from over,
and there's still plenty I can do.

824
00:50:52,394 --> 00:50:53,588
- Johnny, please.
- Unhand me, Mother.

825
00:50:53,628 --> 00:50:54,822
- Unhand me, Mother.
- Please, Anna.

826
00:50:54,863 --> 00:50:56,160
John!

827
00:50:56,197 --> 00:50:57,664
Mother.

828
00:50:57,699 --> 00:50:59,326
John, are you coming or not?

829
00:50:59,367 --> 00:51:00,561
Johnny, please.

830
00:51:00,602 --> 00:51:03,662
If this cause ain't worth fightin' for,
then what is?

831
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:08,075
So that was the last time
you saw your son?

832
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:09,201
Yes.

833
00:51:09,244 --> 00:51:11,212
Less than two weeks
before the assassination?

834
00:51:11,746 --> 00:51:12,235
Yes.

835
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,009
So then, you see, you admit

836
00:51:14,049 --> 00:51:16,381
that your son conspired to kill
President Lincoln.

837
00:51:16,418 --> 00:51:18,511
I don't know.

838
00:51:20,555 --> 00:51:22,113
May God help you.

839
00:51:22,157 --> 00:51:24,523
Honestly, Mr. Aiken, I don't know.

840
00:51:28,596 --> 00:51:30,223
Lord, I pray not.

841
00:51:31,266 --> 00:51:35,635
All I know is that I did not.

842
00:51:39,741 --> 00:51:41,140
I swear.

843
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:03,963
Miss Surratt.

844
00:52:05,467 --> 00:52:07,162
You have to tell me exactly--

845
00:52:07,202 --> 00:52:08,191
How is my mother?

846
00:52:08,236 --> 00:52:09,897
She's managing. You have to tell me

847
00:52:09,938 --> 00:52:10,927
exactly what happened here.

848
00:52:10,972 --> 00:52:12,132
What do you mean?

849
00:52:12,173 --> 00:52:14,300
Do you know that Louis Weichmann,
uh, your friend,

850
00:52:14,342 --> 00:52:16,333
testified against your mother

851
00:52:16,378 --> 00:52:18,812
after you told me
he was like a son to her?

852
00:52:20,014 --> 00:52:21,743
What went on here?

853
00:52:21,783 --> 00:52:23,307
Why should I trust you?

854
00:52:23,351 --> 00:52:25,182
Because your mother told me everything.

855
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,983
She told me about John.

856
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:32,091
She told me about the plot to kidnap
President Lincoln.

857
00:52:33,628 --> 00:52:37,689
Anna, did you try and stop him?

858
00:52:37,732 --> 00:52:39,700
How was I supposed to do that?

859
00:52:39,734 --> 00:52:41,099
'Cause you're his older sister.

860
00:52:41,136 --> 00:52:43,331
You don't know how stubborn
my brother can be.

861
00:52:43,371 --> 00:52:46,772
All right. Did your brother
conspire to kill the president?

862
00:52:46,808 --> 00:52:48,639
My brother left town weeks
before the assassination.

863
00:52:48,676 --> 00:52:50,143
It proves nothing. Look, the night
he left the boarding house--

864
00:52:50,178 --> 00:52:51,167
I've said all I will.

865
00:52:51,212 --> 00:52:52,873
Miss Surratt, I'm trying--

866
00:52:52,914 --> 00:52:55,314
I'm trying to help.

867
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:57,443
By condemning my brother?

868
00:52:57,485 --> 00:53:01,478
Mr. Aiken, my mother would never
allow that, and neither would l.

869
00:53:01,523 --> 00:53:05,391
Oh. All right. All right, look,
you knew about Weichmann.

870
00:53:05,427 --> 00:53:09,158
If you know any potential witnesses
the prosecution might call

871
00:53:09,197 --> 00:53:11,495
or what evidence
they'll use against her,

872
00:53:11,533 --> 00:53:12,864
you must tell me.

873
00:53:16,304 --> 00:53:17,703
Will you help me?

874
00:53:18,406 --> 00:53:19,805
Let us proceed with events

875
00:53:19,841 --> 00:53:21,832
following the assassination
of President Lincoln.

876
00:53:21,876 --> 00:53:23,571
On the night of April 17,

877
00:53:23,611 --> 00:53:25,306
what were your duties, Major Smith?

878
00:53:25,346 --> 00:53:27,246
I was charged with finding John Surratt,

879
00:53:27,282 --> 00:53:30,342
and we were searching the house.

880
00:53:30,385 --> 00:53:32,114
Major, I found these.

881
00:53:32,153 --> 00:53:34,849
They were here
in the daughter's bedroom.

882
00:53:44,032 --> 00:53:47,866
Major Smith, please read aloud
what's inscribed here.

883
00:53:47,902 --> 00:53:49,733
"Sic semper tyrannis."

884
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:52,501
Could you translate?

885
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:54,599
Of course. "Thus always for tyrants."

886
00:53:54,642 --> 00:53:56,371
Are those words familiar to you?

887
00:53:56,411 --> 00:53:57,605
Indeed.

888
00:53:57,645 --> 00:54:00,614
Booth yelled them
after he cut down our president.

889
00:54:00,648 --> 00:54:03,412
You found the same three days later

890
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:05,851
in her daughter's bedroom
next to a photograph

891
00:54:05,887 --> 00:54:07,115
of the assassin himself.

892
00:54:08,389 --> 00:54:10,016
Like a shrine, sir.

893
00:54:10,058 --> 00:54:11,423
Uh...

894
00:54:11,459 --> 00:54:13,017
Please continue.

895
00:54:13,061 --> 00:54:15,427
Uh, objection.

896
00:54:15,463 --> 00:54:18,398
Sic semper tyrannis
is the state motto of virginia.

897
00:54:18,433 --> 00:54:21,402
It hardly constitutes proof
of a shrine to Booth.

898
00:54:21,436 --> 00:54:23,529
No further proof is needed, Mr. Aiken.

899
00:54:23,571 --> 00:54:24,731
Proceed, Mr. Holt.

900
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:27,505
Continue, Major Smith.

901
00:54:28,543 --> 00:54:30,977
As I was fixing to take the Surratts
to headquarters for questioning,

902
00:54:31,012 --> 00:54:32,639
there was a knock at the door.

903
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,772
You all right, ma'am?

904
00:54:46,261 --> 00:54:47,922
I--I must be mistaken.

905
00:54:47,962 --> 00:54:49,896
Wait a minute.

906
00:54:49,931 --> 00:54:52,229
Whom do you wish to see?

907
00:54:52,267 --> 00:54:53,996
Uh, Mrs. Surratt.

908
00:54:54,035 --> 00:54:56,265
This is her place. Bring him in.

909
00:55:05,513 --> 00:55:07,003
Is she expecting you?

910
00:55:07,549 --> 00:55:10,416
She sent for me,
asked me to dig a gutter for her.

911
00:55:10,451 --> 00:55:11,918
At this time of night?

912
00:55:11,953 --> 00:55:15,480
In the morning.
I just wanted to know what time.

913
00:55:15,523 --> 00:55:18,515
Bring Mrs. Surratt in here.

914
00:55:23,831 --> 00:55:27,028
Ma'am, did you hire this man
to dig a gutter for you?

915
00:55:28,269 --> 00:55:29,793
No, sir.

916
00:55:29,837 --> 00:55:31,304
Do you know this man?

917
00:55:36,578 --> 00:55:38,011
No, sir.

918
00:55:40,815 --> 00:55:43,545
Is this the man she denies knowing?

919
00:55:43,585 --> 00:55:45,143
No, sir.

920
00:55:49,324 --> 00:55:51,485
Is this the man she denies knowing?

921
00:55:51,526 --> 00:55:52,993
Yes, sir.

922
00:55:54,362 --> 00:55:55,795
Lewis Payne.

923
00:55:57,365 --> 00:55:59,765
The same man boarded at the Surratts'

924
00:55:59,801 --> 00:56:03,965
prior to daggering the secretary
of State and his kin.

925
00:56:04,005 --> 00:56:05,267
Yes.

926
00:56:05,306 --> 00:56:07,399
Thank you, Major. Nothing further.

927
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:29,853
Major Smith,
are you aware that Lewis Payne

928
00:56:29,897 --> 00:56:32,195
boarded at the Surratts' under an alias,

929
00:56:32,233 --> 00:56:35,327
claiming to be a Baptist minister
from Baltimore named Wood?

930
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:37,099
That's what she claimed.

931
00:56:37,138 --> 00:56:38,127
She claimed?

932
00:56:38,172 --> 00:56:43,610
I would like to submit into evidence
this ledger of guest accounts

933
00:56:43,945 --> 00:56:45,670
from the Surratt boarding house.

934
00:56:45,713 --> 00:56:49,212
Supposing, as this evidence would seem
to suggest, that that were the truth--

935
00:56:49,257 --> 00:56:51,651
suppose Mrs. Surratt
simply failed that night

936
00:56:51,686 --> 00:56:53,313
to recognize Wood the preacher

937
00:56:53,354 --> 00:56:55,914
in the guise of Payne the ditch digger.

938
00:56:55,957 --> 00:56:59,757
He was standing in full view of her
not three paces.

939
00:57:01,396 --> 00:57:04,331
General Hunter,
since accepting this case,

940
00:57:04,365 --> 00:57:08,859
I have come to learn that my client's
eyesight is defective.

941
00:57:09,904 --> 00:57:13,340
I have here a sworn affidavit
from her doctor stating just that.

942
00:57:13,374 --> 00:57:16,935
Major Smith, it was dark.
It was nighttime.

943
00:57:16,978 --> 00:57:20,607
Isn't it possible Mary Surratt simply...

944
00:57:20,648 --> 00:57:22,138
failed to see him?

945
00:57:23,251 --> 00:57:24,843
If I saw a man dressed as a preacher

946
00:57:24,886 --> 00:57:26,615
and two months later a laborer,

947
00:57:26,654 --> 00:57:29,054
then I would recognize him
as the same person.

948
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:30,079
Thank you, Major Smith.

949
00:57:30,124 --> 00:57:32,217
A simple yes or no will do.

950
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,990
Is it possible she failed
to see him properly?

951
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:37,430
Yes, I suppose it's possible.

952
00:57:37,465 --> 00:57:39,433
No further questions.

953
00:57:39,467 --> 00:57:43,460
The prosecution seems unable
to present any proof of guilt

954
00:57:43,504 --> 00:57:45,529
beyond a reasonable doubt.

955
00:57:53,214 --> 00:57:58,811
Uh, could somebody bring me
the transcript of today's trial?

956
00:57:58,853 --> 00:58:00,616
Shall I read it aloud to you?

957
00:58:00,655 --> 00:58:01,679
Oh, Ed.

958
00:58:03,424 --> 00:58:06,825
Your young associate is
putting up a spirited defense.

959
00:58:06,861 --> 00:58:11,161
Reminds me of a certain lawyer
I had to face 25 years ago.

960
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:13,531
Ah, he learned to fight in your army.

961
00:58:13,568 --> 00:58:15,331
Can I get you a drink?

962
00:58:15,369 --> 00:58:18,361
No, no. No, I won't be staying long.
Reverdy...

963
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:25,543
You've done as much for this nation
as any man I know.

964
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,310
Oh. Feeling's mutual, Ed.

965
00:58:28,349 --> 00:58:32,445
Don't you think it's time for us two
old war horses to call a truce?

966
00:58:33,755 --> 00:58:36,918
Not if you insist on staging
this travesty.

967
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:40,052
This trial will do more
to keep the peace

968
00:58:40,094 --> 00:58:42,062
than any paper treaty could.

969
00:58:42,096 --> 00:58:44,530
Heh. How'd you convince
yourself of that?

970
00:58:44,565 --> 00:58:47,125
Because justice, swift and firm,

971
00:58:47,168 --> 00:58:50,137
will help deter the South
from ever conspiring again,

972
00:58:50,171 --> 00:58:53,140
as well as discouraging the North
from seeking revenge.

973
00:58:53,174 --> 00:58:55,074
What about the rule of law?

974
00:58:55,109 --> 00:58:58,977
My first responsibility is to ensure
that this war stays won.

975
00:58:59,013 --> 00:59:00,275
Oh, and this is how you do it,

976
00:59:00,314 --> 00:59:02,782
by keeping fear alive
as long as you see fit?

977
00:59:02,817 --> 00:59:05,718
Look. "Stanton warns
of future rebel plots,"

978
00:59:05,753 --> 00:59:08,347
uh, water supplies poisoned, um...

979
00:59:08,389 --> 00:59:10,550
firebombing cities.

980
00:59:10,591 --> 00:59:13,617
Uh, yellow fever spreading
all over the place.

981
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:16,357
This is a frightened country, Ed.

982
00:59:16,397 --> 00:59:17,921
You don't need to scare us anymore.

983
00:59:17,965 --> 00:59:20,331
And who is to say that none
of these things could happen?

984
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:23,203
The unspeakable already has--

985
00:59:23,237 --> 00:59:26,468
Our president assassinated,
600,000 dead.

986
00:59:26,507 --> 00:59:28,338
The world has changed, Reverdy.

987
00:59:28,376 --> 00:59:32,574
Abandoning the Constitution
is not the answer.

988
00:59:36,751 --> 00:59:38,844
You may prefer dining alone.

989
00:59:38,886 --> 00:59:41,912
I just hope your young associate
does as well.

990
00:59:41,956 --> 00:59:43,548
If he pushes too hard,

991
00:59:43,591 --> 00:59:46,389
he will make enemies
who will not soon forget.

992
00:59:47,328 --> 00:59:49,193
On this, you know I'm right.

993
01:00:28,035 --> 01:00:29,662
I'm here to see Secretary Stanton, boys.

994
01:00:29,704 --> 01:00:31,228
Stand down.

995
01:00:32,106 --> 01:00:34,939
Sorry, sir. Mr. Stanton doesn't
see anyone without an appointment.

996
01:00:35,543 --> 01:00:36,532
Well, good morning, Mr. Aiken.

997
01:00:36,577 --> 01:00:37,566
Morning.

998
01:00:37,612 --> 01:00:39,842
Perhaps I can be of some assistance.

999
01:00:39,881 --> 01:00:42,406
If you can arrange an appointment
for me with the secretary, you can.

1000
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:44,577
Unfortunately he's quite busy right now,

1001
01:00:44,619 --> 01:00:46,780
but perhaps you'd care
to have a word with me instead.

1002
01:00:47,955 --> 01:00:49,183
Please.

1003
01:00:52,526 --> 01:00:53,925
My client is unwell.

1004
01:00:53,961 --> 01:00:56,452
So I hear. Touch of the woman's curse.

1005
01:00:56,497 --> 01:00:59,864
I'm sure she'll be well enough
to continue her trial in a few days.

1006
01:00:59,901 --> 01:01:02,199
She's been in solitary confinement
for over a month.

1007
01:01:02,236 --> 01:01:04,329
She hasn't eaten in over a week.

1008
01:01:04,372 --> 01:01:05,532
She's refusing to eat.

1009
01:01:05,573 --> 01:01:07,541
All the prisoners are fed daily.

1010
01:01:07,575 --> 01:01:08,872
Soft bread and salted meat.

1011
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:11,344
Unless she has a proper meal
and some fresh air,

1012
01:01:11,379 --> 01:01:13,210
I can't guarantee
she'll be fit for trial.

1013
01:01:13,247 --> 01:01:16,444
One of the conspirators
refuses to be guarded by a Negro,

1014
01:01:16,484 --> 01:01:18,884
and the other insists on only eating
his mother's cooking.

1015
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,114
We can't accommodate every whim.

1016
01:01:20,154 --> 01:01:23,715
Come now. I am merely asking for you
to stop treating her like a savage.

1017
01:01:24,492 --> 01:01:26,790
How dare you accuse us of savagery?

1018
01:01:27,895 --> 01:01:30,557
Have you forgotten how our own
were treated by the rebels?

1019
01:01:30,598 --> 01:01:31,587
Of course not.

1020
01:01:31,632 --> 01:01:32,621
Well...

1021
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:35,465
But Mary Surratt is in serious decline.

1022
01:01:35,503 --> 01:01:39,166
If this treatment of her continues,
she will not be sound of mind.

1023
01:01:39,206 --> 01:01:42,801
And I trust that is something
the government wishes to avoid.

1024
01:01:44,946 --> 01:01:49,246
I may have a way to serve all interests.

1025
01:01:49,283 --> 01:01:53,379
I'll deny ever telling you this.
Understood?

1026
01:02:11,105 --> 01:02:12,197
Father.

1027
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:13,263
Counselor.

1028
01:02:17,078 --> 01:02:18,705
Feel that sun.

1029
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:23,909
Do I have you to thank for this?

1030
01:02:26,787 --> 01:02:28,118
Well, thank you.

1031
01:02:30,191 --> 01:02:33,524
Well, if I could just get you
to start eating.

1032
01:02:34,962 --> 01:02:36,987
Left. Left.

1033
01:02:37,031 --> 01:02:38,396
Left, right, left.

1034
01:02:39,467 --> 01:02:40,525
Company halt.

1035
01:02:40,568 --> 01:02:42,968
Mary, there's something
I need to ask you.

1036
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,199
I've never seen you
at a loss for words, young man:

1037
01:02:52,747 --> 01:02:54,305
Do you know where your son is hiding?

1038
01:02:54,348 --> 01:02:55,406
Johnny?

1039
01:02:55,449 --> 01:02:56,507
Of course not.

1040
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:59,041
Government believes you do.

1041
01:03:02,857 --> 01:03:04,722
What do you believe?

1042
01:03:06,127 --> 01:03:09,062
I believe you know more
than you're willing to tell me.

1043
01:03:09,096 --> 01:03:15,763
Uh, have you ever cared for something
greater than yourself?

1044
01:03:18,672 --> 01:03:20,640
I've spent these last four years

1045
01:03:20,674 --> 01:03:23,074
fighting for something
greater than myself,

1046
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:24,941
so don't--

1047
01:03:26,013 --> 01:03:27,674
Then we are the same.

1048
01:03:34,321 --> 01:03:37,757
Mary, you have to tell us
where your son is.

1049
01:03:37,792 --> 01:03:40,454
Us?

1050
01:03:40,494 --> 01:03:42,689
I have to tell "us"?

1051
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:44,197
Whose side are you on?

1052
01:03:44,231 --> 01:03:45,698
I'm trying to defend you.

1053
01:03:45,733 --> 01:03:48,861
By suggesting I trade
my son for myself?

1054
01:03:50,304 --> 01:03:53,364
You're trying to save you, Mr. Aiken.

1055
01:03:53,407 --> 01:03:57,207
I wish I could give you
what you need. I truly do.

1056
01:03:57,244 --> 01:04:00,702
But if you want out,
you'll have to find another way.

1057
01:04:05,853 --> 01:04:07,650
I'm gonna take a walk.

1058
01:04:07,688 --> 01:04:08,985
It's so nice out.

1059
01:04:09,023 --> 01:04:11,355
Do you care to walk with me?

1060
01:04:14,328 --> 01:04:16,319
So we're stuck
in these shallow trenches.

1061
01:04:16,363 --> 01:04:17,523
We're surrounded on all sides.

1062
01:04:17,565 --> 01:04:19,362
Nobody knows what to do.
Nobody knows what to say.

1063
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,561
We're frozen, completely petrified.

1064
01:04:21,602 --> 01:04:23,092
And then from somewhere up on the hill,

1065
01:04:23,137 --> 01:04:25,298
we hear this loud
booming Southern voice.

1066
01:04:25,339 --> 01:04:26,567
It's the rebel general.

1067
01:04:26,607 --> 01:04:28,837
He yells, "Y'all boys
better say your prayers,

1068
01:04:28,876 --> 01:04:31,367
because there are 400 of us
and only 100 of you."

1069
01:04:31,412 --> 01:04:32,743
You can stop right there, Baker.

1070
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:34,975
And so then this madman, he stands up,

1071
01:04:35,015 --> 01:04:37,210
and he yells back to him, and he says--

1072
01:04:37,251 --> 01:04:39,412
he says, "Hundred?
Heck, we've got less than that.

1073
01:04:39,453 --> 01:04:41,614
But we don't surrender,
so come and get us."

1074
01:04:41,655 --> 01:04:42,679
And with that,

1075
01:04:42,723 --> 01:04:45,089
he pulls down his pants
and bares his arse.

1076
01:04:46,794 --> 01:04:47,783
You didn't.

1077
01:04:47,828 --> 01:04:49,921
- I didn't.
- What?

1078
01:04:49,964 --> 01:04:52,933
It doesn't seem as though Fred
ever intends to surrender.

1079
01:04:52,967 --> 01:04:54,696
Ah, it appears he already has.

1080
01:04:54,735 --> 01:04:57,533
She's fair, fit and 40.

1081
01:04:58,706 --> 01:05:01,038
Is it true Mrs. Surratt is a Catholic,

1082
01:05:01,075 --> 01:05:02,838
wears black from head to toe?

1083
01:05:02,877 --> 01:05:06,369
I hear she spits in the faces
of every Union soldier she encounters.

1084
01:05:06,413 --> 01:05:09,541
Apparently she wears a necklace
made from the bone of a Union soldier.

1085
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:12,575
Seriously, Fred, do you honestly
doubt she's guilty?

1086
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:19,425
So, okay, who would like to dance?

1087
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,394
- Yes.
- Yes. Good.

1088
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:38,711
Dance?

1089
01:05:38,746 --> 01:05:40,373
It's more like a wake.

1090
01:05:40,414 --> 01:05:42,905
I suppose I should have dressed
more like Mrs. Surratt.

1091
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:47,248
Fred, what are you doing?

1092
01:05:47,288 --> 01:05:50,553
I'm enduring the pain
of having to listen to Baker.

1093
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,785
You know what I mean.

1094
01:05:52,927 --> 01:05:55,293
If she's found guilty,
they'll say you weren't up to the task.

1095
01:05:56,997 --> 01:05:58,487
And God forbid you prevail.

1096
01:05:58,532 --> 01:06:01,592
They'll think you just as much
a traitor as she.

1097
01:06:01,635 --> 01:06:04,934
Baker, how 'bout something
a little happier?

1098
01:06:06,774 --> 01:06:07,968
- Little happier?
- Yeah.

1099
01:06:08,008 --> 01:06:10,875
All right, Fred. Happier, he wants.

1100
01:06:18,619 --> 01:06:20,280
William's right, you know.

1101
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:22,619
Either outcome, you cannot prevail.

1102
01:06:22,656 --> 01:06:24,055
Sarah.

1103
01:06:24,091 --> 01:06:27,925
What is it about Mary Surratt
you find so compelling?

1104
01:06:27,962 --> 01:06:31,625
These are criminal,
despicable people, Fred.

1105
01:06:31,665 --> 01:06:32,927
They're--they're the same sort of people

1106
01:06:32,967 --> 01:06:34,935
you risked your life fighting against,

1107
01:06:34,969 --> 01:06:37,096
and she helped kill
your commander in chief.

1108
01:06:37,137 --> 01:06:39,037
I don't know what she's guilty of.

1109
01:06:44,178 --> 01:06:45,611
May I ask you one more thing?

1110
01:06:45,646 --> 01:06:47,705
What is it, Sarah?

1111
01:06:47,748 --> 01:06:50,717
Does the captain remember how to dance?

1112
01:06:55,122 --> 01:06:56,146
Of course.

1113
01:07:00,327 --> 01:07:04,127
Few people will forget
what side you fought on.

1114
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:08,032
Trust me. It can be lonely.

1115
01:07:08,068 --> 01:07:10,093
I'm just upholding my oath
as an attorney

1116
01:07:10,137 --> 01:07:12,196
and doing my job. It's what you asked.

1117
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:14,070
It's what you told me to do.

1118
01:07:14,108 --> 01:07:17,475
This habit of quoting me back to me
could become most irritating.

1119
01:07:17,511 --> 01:07:20,912
You have your mother's convictions
and your father's annoying habits.

1120
01:07:20,948 --> 01:07:24,145
Well, "Mary Surratt is entitled
to a defense, Freddie,

1121
01:07:24,184 --> 01:07:25,913
so I shall defend her."

1122
01:07:28,222 --> 01:07:32,716
If they want John Surratt,

1123
01:07:33,894 --> 01:07:36,454
then you should serve him up
on a platter.

1124
01:07:36,497 --> 01:07:41,935
I--I don't mean, uh, physically.
I mean in spirit.

1125
01:07:41,969 --> 01:07:44,403
You have to prove to the Commission

1126
01:07:44,438 --> 01:07:47,430
that he is responsible, not her.

1127
01:07:49,943 --> 01:07:51,001
She's not gonna like that.

1128
01:07:52,212 --> 01:07:54,578
Mr. Lloyd, you are a tenant
of Mary Surratt, are you not?

1129
01:07:54,615 --> 01:07:55,673
Yes, sir.

1130
01:07:55,716 --> 01:07:58,184
I run a tavern some 10 miles
from the city

1131
01:07:58,218 --> 01:08:00,846
on a property she owns.

1132
01:08:00,888 --> 01:08:05,120
And on the afternoon
that President Lincoln was assassinated,

1133
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:07,457
did Mary Surratt pay you a visit?

1134
01:08:07,494 --> 01:08:11,590
Yes, sir, in the company
of Louis Weichmann.

1135
01:08:15,969 --> 01:08:17,903
And she brought you a package,
did she not?

1136
01:08:17,938 --> 01:08:19,371
Yes, sir. That's correct, sir.

1137
01:08:19,406 --> 01:08:21,271
Small package wrapped in newspaper.

1138
01:08:25,646 --> 01:08:28,114
Did she tell you where
the package came from?

1139
01:08:28,148 --> 01:08:30,548
Said it came from John Wilkes Booth.

1140
01:08:32,386 --> 01:08:34,251
John Wilkes Booth!

1141
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,121
And what exactly did she give you?

1142
01:08:37,157 --> 01:08:38,590
Objection.

1143
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:40,991
There's no way the defendant
could have known what was inside.

1144
01:08:41,028 --> 01:08:42,757
He just testified the package
was wrapped.

1145
01:08:43,664 --> 01:08:44,358
Overruled.

1146
01:08:44,398 --> 01:08:46,059
Witness will answer the question.

1147
01:08:47,201 --> 01:08:51,160
Mr. Lloyd, what was inside the package?

1148
01:08:51,205 --> 01:08:52,536
Field glasses, sir.

1149
01:08:52,573 --> 01:08:53,767
Field glasses?

1150
01:08:53,807 --> 01:08:55,104
Field glasses like these?

1151
01:08:55,142 --> 01:08:56,302
Exactly.

1152
01:08:56,343 --> 01:09:00,712
With the initials "J.W.B."
inscribed on them.

1153
01:09:02,516 --> 01:09:04,780
Did she give you any instructions?

1154
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:07,286
Sir?

1155
01:09:07,321 --> 01:09:09,380
Instructions, Mr. Lloyd?

1156
01:09:09,423 --> 01:09:11,914
Instructions
which may affect this trial?

1157
01:09:14,428 --> 01:09:16,055
Oh. Yes, sir.

1158
01:09:16,096 --> 01:09:17,688
Ahem. She told me,

1159
01:09:17,731 --> 01:09:20,894
"Lloyd, get those shootin' irons ready.

1160
01:09:20,934 --> 01:09:24,461
There will be parties here tonight
who will call for them."

1161
01:09:24,505 --> 01:09:25,494
You liar!

1162
01:09:25,539 --> 01:09:26,528
Order!

1163
01:09:26,573 --> 01:09:27,665
- He's a liar!
- Order!

1164
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:28,766
- It's a lie.
- Order!

1165
01:09:31,011 --> 01:09:32,876
Control yourself, madam.

1166
01:09:33,247 --> 01:09:36,239
Such outbursts will only
prejudice your case.

1167
01:09:36,283 --> 01:09:38,547
Oh, Lord.

1168
01:09:39,887 --> 01:09:43,323
I just don't see how I could possibly
further prejudice this case, sir.

1169
01:09:43,357 --> 01:09:46,690
Counselor, you will control your client.

1170
01:09:46,727 --> 01:09:48,319
General.

1171
01:09:50,898 --> 01:09:52,456
Shooting irons!

1172
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:54,664
Shooting irons.

1173
01:09:54,701 --> 01:09:56,669
And to what was she referring?

1174
01:09:56,703 --> 01:09:58,068
Army rifles, sir,

1175
01:09:58,105 --> 01:10:01,165
hidden in the joist
above the dining room.

1176
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:02,675
And what else did she tell you?

1177
01:10:02,709 --> 01:10:06,167
She said I was to get two bottles
of whiskey ready, too.

1178
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:11,316
And were these things called for,

1179
01:10:11,351 --> 01:10:13,285
as per the defendant's instructions?

1180
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,309
Yes, sir.

1181
01:10:14,354 --> 01:10:15,651
About midnight, sir,

1182
01:10:15,689 --> 01:10:17,486
the night of the assassination,

1183
01:10:17,524 --> 01:10:20,652
by two men on horses, one...

1184
01:10:21,862 --> 01:10:23,022
I'd seen before.

1185
01:10:25,299 --> 01:10:28,393
T'other was a stranger to me.

1186
01:10:29,303 --> 01:10:33,967
I brought the items, thinking these
were the parties Mrs. Surratt meant.

1187
01:10:51,058 --> 01:10:52,548
Two of 'em rode off so fast,

1188
01:10:52,593 --> 01:10:56,586
they could have outrun Creation
and give it two-mile a start.

1189
01:10:59,933 --> 01:11:01,025
Your witness.

1190
01:11:03,203 --> 01:11:04,670
I did not...

1191
01:11:07,641 --> 01:11:08,938
Mr. Lloyd.

1192
01:11:14,248 --> 01:11:16,011
Mr. Lloyd, you just testified

1193
01:11:16,049 --> 01:11:19,485
that Louis Weichmann accompanied
the defendant that afternoon.

1194
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,782
Right.

1195
01:11:21,355 --> 01:11:22,788
So then I can correctly assume

1196
01:11:22,823 --> 01:11:26,452
that he would also testify
to having heard her instructions to you.

1197
01:11:26,493 --> 01:11:28,017
No.

1198
01:11:28,428 --> 01:11:31,420
She took me out by the woodpile
out of earshot.

1199
01:11:31,465 --> 01:11:35,333
So you're saying that nobody
heard this conversation,

1200
01:11:35,369 --> 01:11:36,734
just you and her.

1201
01:11:37,538 --> 01:11:38,835
Way it happened, sir.

1202
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:40,664
Of course it is.

1203
01:11:41,742 --> 01:11:42,538
Of course it is.

1204
01:11:44,077 --> 01:11:48,241
When did you learn
of President Lincoln's assassination?

1205
01:11:48,649 --> 01:11:50,583
Well, who can forget when they heard?

1206
01:11:50,617 --> 01:11:54,246
The next morning,
a Captain Cottingham told me.

1207
01:11:55,055 --> 01:11:57,853
He was searching for the assassins.

1208
01:11:57,891 --> 01:11:59,756
No doubt, you were most upset.

1209
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:01,559
Indeed.

1210
01:12:02,262 --> 01:12:04,662
I got myself right smart in liquor.

1211
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:10,136
Yes, you're--you're right smart
in liquor most days,

1212
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:11,330
- aren't you, Mr. Lloyd?
- Objection.

1213
01:12:11,371 --> 01:12:13,965
In fact, I hear that you're
your own best customer.

1214
01:12:14,007 --> 01:12:14,996
Objection.

1215
01:12:15,042 --> 01:12:17,135
Sustained.

1216
01:12:18,211 --> 01:12:20,645
This Captain Cottingham,

1217
01:12:20,681 --> 01:12:24,845
did he ask you anything in reference
to the assassins?

1218
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:28,517
He asked if any parties
had passed through.

1219
01:12:28,555 --> 01:12:30,716
Naturally I told him
about the two I knew.

1220
01:12:30,757 --> 01:12:32,850
Actually, you did not.

1221
01:12:36,763 --> 01:12:39,459
According to this witness report,

1222
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,797
you said nothing for two days.

1223
01:12:42,836 --> 01:12:44,235
I was frightened is all.

1224
01:12:45,038 --> 01:12:47,472
l feared the assassins
might come for me.

1225
01:12:47,507 --> 01:12:49,975
Perhaps, though, you were afraid
that the authorities

1226
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:52,308
might consider you an accessory.

1227
01:12:52,346 --> 01:12:56,874
Well, it was through the Surratts
that I got myself in such difficulty.

1228
01:12:56,917 --> 01:12:58,145
The Surratts.

1229
01:12:58,185 --> 01:13:01,052
Don't you mean John Surratt,
to be more precise?

1230
01:13:02,356 --> 01:13:03,618
Wasn't it he who brought
the shooting irons

1231
01:13:03,657 --> 01:13:06,023
to your tavern door in the first place?

1232
01:13:06,059 --> 01:13:07,048
Yeah.

1233
01:13:07,094 --> 01:13:08,891
And he showed you where to hide them?

1234
01:13:08,929 --> 01:13:10,260
I didn't want to.

1235
01:13:10,297 --> 01:13:13,528
So you're saying that he asked you,

1236
01:13:13,567 --> 01:13:16,195
forced you to do so against your will.

1237
01:13:18,372 --> 01:13:19,202
Yes.

1238
01:13:19,239 --> 01:13:21,833
So he brought them to you,

1239
01:13:22,542 --> 01:13:24,203
he showed you where to hide them,

1240
01:13:24,244 --> 01:13:26,906
and he forced you to hide them
against your will?

1241
01:13:26,947 --> 01:13:29,643
That's right. Yes, exactly.

1242
01:13:30,484 --> 01:13:32,748
If John Surratt was capable

1243
01:13:32,786 --> 01:13:35,084
of putting Mr. Lloyd, Louis Weichmann

1244
01:13:35,122 --> 01:13:36,680
and Lord knows how many others at risk,

1245
01:13:36,723 --> 01:13:38,657
who's to say he didn't do
the same to his mother?

1246
01:13:38,692 --> 01:13:39,886
- Objection.
- Stop this!

1247
01:13:39,926 --> 01:13:42,019
- Sir, it seems the--
- Stop it right now, Mr. Aiken.

1248
01:13:42,062 --> 01:13:43,529
- It seems the only thing...
- Objection.

1249
01:13:43,563 --> 01:13:45,690
- General, objection.
- that Mary Surratt might be guilty of

1250
01:13:45,732 --> 01:13:49,099
- is having given birth to her son John.
- How dare you?

1251
01:13:49,136 --> 01:13:51,696
Objection sustained.
That will be all, Mr. Aiken.

1252
01:13:57,778 --> 01:13:59,370
Just to be clear, Mr. Lloyd,

1253
01:13:59,413 --> 01:14:01,381
it was the defendant, Mary Surratt,

1254
01:14:01,415 --> 01:14:03,610
who just hours before the assassination

1255
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:05,083
brought you field glasses

1256
01:14:05,118 --> 01:14:08,781
and instructed you to prepare rifles
and two bottles of whiskey?

1257
01:14:11,391 --> 01:14:12,380
Yeah.

1258
01:14:12,426 --> 01:14:13,450
Thank you.

1259
01:14:14,494 --> 01:14:16,553
General Hunter,

1260
01:14:16,596 --> 01:14:18,791
members of the Commission,

1261
01:14:18,832 --> 01:14:22,700
the government rests its case
against Mary Surratt.

1262
01:14:22,736 --> 01:14:25,933
That'll be all, Mr. Lloyd.
You may step down.

1263
01:14:28,942 --> 01:14:31,308
What did they promise you
to say that, Mr. Lloyd?

1264
01:14:31,344 --> 01:14:32,641
Counselor, I'm warning you.

1265
01:14:32,679 --> 01:14:35,648
Bet a case of whiskey's all it took.

1266
01:14:35,682 --> 01:14:38,082
You best hush up.
I'll put you in the ground, boy.

1267
01:14:38,118 --> 01:14:40,313
Mr. Aiken, you will sit down, sir.

1268
01:14:40,353 --> 01:14:41,786
You shut him up.

1269
01:14:41,822 --> 01:14:43,312
Sit down, sir.

1270
01:14:51,264 --> 01:14:52,196
Now...

1271
01:14:53,967 --> 01:14:55,025
we will adjourn.

1272
01:14:55,702 --> 01:14:56,760
When we resume,

1273
01:14:56,803 --> 01:14:58,737
the defense may call its first witness.

1274
01:15:09,382 --> 01:15:11,509
Left. Left.

1275
01:15:20,594 --> 01:15:21,686
Excuse me, sirs.

1276
01:15:21,728 --> 01:15:22,888
Uh, Captain Cottingham?

1277
01:15:23,563 --> 01:15:24,552
Yes.

1278
01:15:24,598 --> 01:15:26,225
Can I have a word with you, please?

1279
01:15:27,901 --> 01:15:28,890
Sir.

1280
01:15:29,636 --> 01:15:31,228
And did you interview John Lloyd,

1281
01:15:31,838 --> 01:15:34,568
the man who runs the tavern
on Mrs. Surratt's property?

1282
01:15:34,608 --> 01:15:36,098
Yes, right after the assassination.

1283
01:15:36,143 --> 01:15:40,512
And did he tell you that Mrs. Surratt

1284
01:15:40,547 --> 01:15:41,912
asked for rifles and whiskey?

1285
01:15:43,083 --> 01:15:46,211
Yes. Lloyd said Mrs. Surratt asked him
to do all those things.

1286
01:15:49,122 --> 01:15:50,885
Uh, excuse me?

1287
01:15:52,526 --> 01:15:55,689
Did we not talk just yesterday?

1288
01:15:55,729 --> 01:15:56,821
We did.

1289
01:15:56,863 --> 01:15:58,490
And did you not say

1290
01:15:58,532 --> 01:16:03,026
that Mrs. Surratt never asked
for whiskey or rifles of John Lloyd?

1291
01:16:04,304 --> 01:16:05,362
I do not deny that.

1292
01:16:06,106 --> 01:16:07,232
And now you're swearing,

1293
01:16:07,274 --> 01:16:09,970
under oath,
that what you told me then was a lie.

1294
01:16:10,443 --> 01:16:14,379
Yes. I lied to you 'cause I thought
you had no business to ask me.

1295
01:16:14,414 --> 01:16:15,506
No business? I--

1296
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:17,810
You're my witness.

1297
01:16:18,685 --> 01:16:20,380
Should I not expect the truth?

1298
01:16:21,054 --> 01:16:22,988
I state here that I did lie to you,

1299
01:16:23,023 --> 01:16:26,515
but under oath,
now I'm telling the truth.

1300
01:16:32,599 --> 01:16:35,067
Mr. Holt, do you wish
to question the witness?

1301
01:16:35,101 --> 01:16:38,195
Uh, no. I believe what we've heard
is more than sufficient.

1302
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:41,605
Captain, you may step down.

1303
01:16:42,642 --> 01:16:44,269
As you know, tonight marks

1304
01:16:44,311 --> 01:16:47,508
Washington's celebration
honoring our troops,

1305
01:16:47,547 --> 01:16:48,878
so we will adjourn.

1306
01:16:56,690 --> 01:16:59,215
It's not enough, is it, Mr. Holt?

1307
01:16:59,759 --> 01:17:01,226
It's not enough that you, uh--

1308
01:17:01,261 --> 01:17:04,389
you set the rules.
You--You pick the judges.

1309
01:17:04,431 --> 01:17:06,592
Now you have to turn my witness as well.

1310
01:17:06,633 --> 01:17:07,827
Counselor, control yourself.

1311
01:17:07,868 --> 01:17:09,631
Control the prosecution.

1312
01:17:09,669 --> 01:17:10,658
Mr. Aiken.

1313
01:17:10,704 --> 01:17:13,969
Every witness I wish to call has either
been turned by jail or the threat of it.

1314
01:17:14,007 --> 01:17:14,996
That's enough!

1315
01:17:15,041 --> 01:17:17,874
There is no limit to how far
the prosecution is willing to go!

1316
01:17:17,911 --> 01:17:20,709
Stand down, counselor,
or I will hold you in contempt.

1317
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:26,678
You had better comport yourself
in a more appropriate manner,

1318
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:29,712
or you will find yourself
incarcerated with the others.

1319
01:17:38,632 --> 01:17:40,190
Good evening.

1320
01:17:43,703 --> 01:17:45,193
Good evening, Douglas.

1321
01:17:45,238 --> 01:17:46,296
- Ma'am.
- Good evening.

1322
01:17:46,339 --> 01:17:49,308
Mr. Aiken, may I have a word with you?

1323
01:17:49,342 --> 01:17:51,037
Of course. Would you excuse me?

1324
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,243
MAN: His first day on the job.

1325
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:11,558
I'm sorry, Mr. Aiken.

1326
01:18:11,598 --> 01:18:14,066
It's all right, Douglas.
It's not your fault.

1327
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:15,567
Frederick!

1328
01:18:15,602 --> 01:18:19,129
Uh, Nick, would you escort Sarah
upstairs for me, please?

1329
01:18:19,172 --> 01:18:21,606
Sure, but, uh--

1330
01:18:21,641 --> 01:18:23,632
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

1331
01:18:24,044 --> 01:18:25,534
Come on, Sarah.

1332
01:18:25,578 --> 01:18:28,638
Even with one good leg,
I can still outdance him.

1333
01:18:28,682 --> 01:18:29,706
Another night, Nick.

1334
01:18:35,555 --> 01:18:36,920
Sarah.

1335
01:18:38,191 --> 01:18:39,783
Sarah, where are you going?

1336
01:18:40,627 --> 01:18:41,958
"Conduct unbecoming."

1337
01:18:41,995 --> 01:18:43,485
I'm sorry about the party.

1338
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:44,758
You think I care about the party?

1339
01:18:44,798 --> 01:18:46,595
Please. Everything will be all right.
I promise you.

1340
01:18:46,633 --> 01:18:48,032
You are just like that woman,

1341
01:18:48,068 --> 01:18:51,936
ready to go to the gallows
for the most pointless cause.

1342
01:18:51,972 --> 01:18:54,099
People do get left behind
when you do that.

1343
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:56,040
I can't ignore what's going on
in that courtroom.

1344
01:18:56,076 --> 01:18:58,374
But you can ignore me, us?

1345
01:18:58,411 --> 01:19:00,174
I didn't say that.
Please, I have to do this.

1346
01:19:00,213 --> 01:19:01,202
Do you?

1347
01:19:01,247 --> 01:19:04,910
I find your devotion to this frightening.

1348
01:19:04,951 --> 01:19:08,148
I waited such a long time for you.

1349
01:19:08,188 --> 01:19:09,246
I'm so sorry.

1350
01:19:09,289 --> 01:19:11,348
I know. But I'm back now.

1351
01:19:11,391 --> 01:19:13,291
No, you're not.

1352
01:19:13,326 --> 01:19:14,315
I am, I--ple--

1353
01:19:14,361 --> 01:19:15,988
Sarah, please, will you just--

1354
01:19:16,029 --> 01:19:18,327
We have to-- we have to talk about this.

1355
01:19:18,365 --> 01:19:21,129
Fred, I love you, I--

1356
01:19:21,167 --> 01:19:24,034
I wish I could do this. I just--I can't.

1357
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:25,935
I just can't.

1358
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:27,866
Wait. Let me see you home at least.

1359
01:19:27,907 --> 01:19:29,033
Please wait.

1360
01:19:38,651 --> 01:19:39,948
Uh, Mr. Secretary.

1361
01:19:40,687 --> 01:19:41,949
I have to speak with you.

1362
01:19:41,988 --> 01:19:44,752
Mr. Aiken, perhaps this isn't
the best time.

1363
01:19:44,791 --> 01:19:47,259
What is happening to Mary Surratt
is an abomination.

1364
01:19:47,293 --> 01:19:48,317
Stand down, Captain.

1365
01:19:48,361 --> 01:19:49,555
It's all right.

1366
01:19:49,596 --> 01:19:51,564
Would you escort Mrs. Stanton in?

1367
01:19:51,598 --> 01:19:53,225
I'll just be a moment.

1368
01:19:53,266 --> 01:19:54,290
Yes, sir.

1369
01:19:55,668 --> 01:19:57,192
Young man...

1370
01:19:57,971 --> 01:19:59,996
always indebted to you
for your courage in the field,

1371
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,632
but you must learn to tread lightly.

1372
01:20:01,674 --> 01:20:02,663
Tread lightly?

1373
01:20:02,709 --> 01:20:04,301
I will not tread lightly.

1374
01:20:04,344 --> 01:20:06,175
You have predetermined her fate.

1375
01:20:06,212 --> 01:20:08,703
Mary Surratt's fate rests entirely
with the Commission.

1376
01:20:08,748 --> 01:20:10,682
My concern is preserving our Union.

1377
01:20:10,717 --> 01:20:14,084
Why did I fight for the Union
if my rights aren't assured?

1378
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:15,144
You tell me.

1379
01:20:15,188 --> 01:20:17,520
Fine words for rallying the troops,
not for running a nation.

1380
01:20:17,557 --> 01:20:19,616
They assassinated our president,

1381
01:20:19,659 --> 01:20:21,889
and someone must be held accountable.

1382
01:20:21,928 --> 01:20:23,759
The people want that.

1383
01:20:23,797 --> 01:20:26,357
It's John Surratt you want.
You don't even want Mary.

1384
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:27,457
I'll settle for either one.

1385
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,764
If you'll excuse me, my wife is waiting.

1386
01:21:24,991 --> 01:21:26,322
Mr. Aiken.

1387
01:21:26,793 --> 01:21:27,919
May I come in?

1388
01:21:27,961 --> 01:21:29,292
- It's late.
- I know.

1389
01:21:38,204 --> 01:21:40,434
I need you to testify.

1390
01:21:41,741 --> 01:21:42,935
very well.

1391
01:21:42,976 --> 01:21:45,536
I'll tell them my mother's innocent.

1392
01:21:46,312 --> 01:21:48,872
I need you to tell them
that your brother is not.

1393
01:21:48,915 --> 01:21:51,349
I won't do it.

1394
01:21:51,384 --> 01:21:54,217
You know what'll happen
to her if you don't?

1395
01:21:57,457 --> 01:21:58,856
Anna...

1396
01:21:59,659 --> 01:22:02,253
Your brother does not need
to be saved right now.

1397
01:22:02,896 --> 01:22:03,988
Your mother does.

1398
01:22:09,769 --> 01:22:11,259
Mr. Aiken,

1399
01:22:11,304 --> 01:22:13,465
are there any other
witnesses you wish to call?

1400
01:22:13,506 --> 01:22:16,441
Uh, yes.

1401
01:22:16,476 --> 01:22:19,411
The--The defense

1402
01:22:19,946 --> 01:22:23,074
would like to call Miss Anna Surratt.

1403
01:22:29,489 --> 01:22:31,047
General Hunter, what is--

1404
01:22:37,931 --> 01:22:39,865
Place your right hand on this Bible.

1405
01:22:39,899 --> 01:22:40,888
Where's my mother?

1406
01:22:40,934 --> 01:22:42,299
Anna, she's just right here,

1407
01:22:42,335 --> 01:22:44,132
behind these men.

1408
01:22:44,170 --> 01:22:46,104
Why won't they let me see her?

1409
01:22:46,139 --> 01:22:47,401
I don't know.

1410
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:50,341
Please, Miss Surratt.

1411
01:22:55,215 --> 01:22:56,682
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

1412
01:22:56,716 --> 01:22:58,650
and nothing but the truth,
so help you, God?

1413
01:23:01,654 --> 01:23:02,678
Miss Anna.

1414
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:06,118
I do.

1415
01:23:12,665 --> 01:23:13,654
It'll be all right.

1416
01:23:16,102 --> 01:23:17,364
Miss Surratt, can you tell us

1417
01:23:17,403 --> 01:23:20,839
when your brother first became
acquainted with John Wilkes Booth?

1418
01:23:27,146 --> 01:23:29,876
Miss Surratt, you will
answer the question.

1419
01:23:31,351 --> 01:23:35,447
I believe my brother
met him January last.

1420
01:23:35,488 --> 01:23:37,979
Three months before the assassination.

1421
01:23:38,024 --> 01:23:41,790
He must have been mighty pleased
to have befriended such a famous actor.

1422
01:23:42,662 --> 01:23:44,186
You'll have to ask him.

1423
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:45,993
Well, I'm sure we'd all like to ask him.

1424
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:51,930
Your brother proudly called himself
a friend of Booth's, did he not?

1425
01:23:51,971 --> 01:23:52,801
Mr. Aiken, what are you doing?

1426
01:23:52,839 --> 01:23:53,828
Mother!

1427
01:23:53,873 --> 01:23:55,272
Miss Surratt. Miss Surratt, please.

1428
01:23:57,043 --> 01:23:58,067
Miss Surratt.

1429
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:01,068
I never...

1430
01:24:01,114 --> 01:24:04,948
asked what my brother's
relationship was to Booth.

1431
01:24:04,984 --> 01:24:07,282
It was at John's invitation

1432
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:09,481
that he first came to your home,
was it not?

1433
01:24:09,522 --> 01:24:11,649
Yes.

1434
01:24:18,431 --> 01:24:20,399
Does this picture of Booth
belong to you?

1435
01:24:22,835 --> 01:24:27,295
I found it in a gallery one day,
and I bought it.

1436
01:24:29,442 --> 01:24:32,775
Your brother must have been pleased that
you held his friend in such high regard.

1437
01:24:33,146 --> 01:24:35,239
- No.
- No?

1438
01:24:36,149 --> 01:24:38,845
No. He told me to tear it up
and throw it away.

1439
01:24:39,152 --> 01:24:39,948
Why?

1440
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:42,112
Why did your brother tell you to destroy

1441
01:24:42,155 --> 01:24:43,782
a photograph of his friend, Booth?

1442
01:24:44,357 --> 01:24:45,551
No, Mr. Aiken!

1443
01:24:45,591 --> 01:24:46,888
- Please.
- I beg of you.

1444
01:24:46,926 --> 01:24:48,223
- Please.
- Order!

1445
01:24:48,261 --> 01:24:49,250
Miss Surratt, please.

1446
01:24:50,163 --> 01:24:51,221
Answer my question.

1447
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,594
I suppose he was trying to protect us.

1448
01:24:56,636 --> 01:24:59,230
He was trying to protect
you and your mother?

1449
01:24:59,806 --> 01:25:01,239
Yes.

1450
01:25:01,274 --> 01:25:03,834
Why would he need to protect his family?

1451
01:25:08,815 --> 01:25:10,282
Anna, you have to choose.

1452
01:25:16,022 --> 01:25:17,182
I suppose...

1453
01:25:18,524 --> 01:25:20,754
he and Booth were planning something.

1454
01:25:22,328 --> 01:25:23,659
He was planning something.

1455
01:25:25,164 --> 01:25:26,927
Did you know what?

1456
01:25:27,867 --> 01:25:29,801
Of course not.

1457
01:25:29,836 --> 01:25:31,633
When did you last see your brother?

1458
01:25:32,205 --> 01:25:35,072
He left at the beginning of April.

1459
01:25:35,575 --> 01:25:37,008
Days before the assassination.

1460
01:25:37,043 --> 01:25:39,511
Did he tell you where he was going
or what he might be planning?

1461
01:25:39,545 --> 01:25:41,376
He only said he had to leave.

1462
01:25:42,749 --> 01:25:44,444
And did you or your mother
try to stop him?

1463
01:25:45,318 --> 01:25:47,183
Yes.

1464
01:25:48,388 --> 01:25:52,256
- But we couldn't.
- How could you? He was angry.

1465
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:53,918
He was frustrated with the war.

1466
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:55,018
He hated the Union.

1467
01:25:55,061 --> 01:25:57,393
He would have done
anything in his power,

1468
01:25:57,430 --> 01:26:00,593
even risk his own family
to aid Booth in his cause.

1469
01:26:00,633 --> 01:26:04,535
But, Miss Surratt, did your mother
conspire with John Wilkes Booth?

1470
01:26:04,570 --> 01:26:06,435
Absolutely not.

1471
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:10,532
Thank you.

1472
01:26:11,077 --> 01:26:12,237
There are no more questions.

1473
01:26:16,015 --> 01:26:17,414
General Hunter,
the government understands

1474
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:19,418
why Miss Surratt would be moved

1475
01:26:19,452 --> 01:26:23,183
to the most extraordinary lengths
to conceal her mother's guilt,

1476
01:26:23,222 --> 01:26:26,658
including incriminating her own brother.

1477
01:26:26,692 --> 01:26:28,922
My mother is innocent.

1478
01:26:28,961 --> 01:26:31,327
Miss Surratt, you are dismissed.

1479
01:26:31,364 --> 01:26:32,194
The government no longer
deems it necessary to hold you.

1480
01:26:33,599 --> 01:26:34,566
You are free to leave.

1481
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,124
I just want to see my mother.

1482
01:26:36,169 --> 01:26:39,570
Please. I'm sorry, mother.

1483
01:26:39,605 --> 01:26:41,163
I'm sorry.

1484
01:26:41,207 --> 01:26:44,404
Please. Please, let me see her.

1485
01:26:48,181 --> 01:26:51,241
Sir, the defense would push
for the Commission

1486
01:26:51,284 --> 01:26:53,252
to show some compassion
and allow a mother

1487
01:26:53,286 --> 01:26:56,278
to see her daughter
for a brief moment only.

1488
01:26:59,926 --> 01:27:02,360
We will reconvene in the morning.

1489
01:27:36,162 --> 01:27:38,221
Frederick, it's me.

1490
01:27:38,264 --> 01:27:40,255
Anna.

1491
01:27:40,299 --> 01:27:41,960
What are you doing here?

1492
01:27:44,737 --> 01:27:48,901
You never asked why I had Booth's photo.

1493
01:27:52,612 --> 01:27:54,580
Tear that up and throw it away.

1494
01:27:54,847 --> 01:27:58,112
That man is gonna get us all
in trouble, if not worse.

1495
01:28:05,791 --> 01:28:07,418
I should have thrown it away,

1496
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:09,189
but I didn't.

1497
01:28:18,437 --> 01:28:21,565
So you were infatuated with Booth.

1498
01:28:22,241 --> 01:28:25,733
I swear I didn't know
what he was capable of.

1499
01:28:26,345 --> 01:28:29,678
I believe you. But your brother did.

1500
01:28:31,484 --> 01:28:33,645
Can you save my mother without him?

1501
01:28:33,686 --> 01:28:35,677
Can you, Frederick?

1502
01:28:39,058 --> 01:28:40,116
Probably not.

1503
01:28:47,233 --> 01:28:48,427
Father Walter!

1504
01:28:50,903 --> 01:28:51,835
Father?

1505
01:28:54,974 --> 01:28:57,306
Will you excuse us for a minute?

1506
01:28:58,544 --> 01:28:59,533
Counselor.

1507
01:28:59,579 --> 01:29:02,139
I need to see John Surratt right away.

1508
01:29:03,649 --> 01:29:05,674
Anna Surratt sent me.

1509
01:29:05,718 --> 01:29:09,381
Well, as I told Miss Surratt,
I can only pass along a message.

1510
01:29:09,855 --> 01:29:11,015
Where is he?

1511
01:29:12,592 --> 01:29:13,490
I don't know.

1512
01:29:14,427 --> 01:29:17,362
Only that some in the church have chosen
to provide him sanctuary.

1513
01:29:17,396 --> 01:29:19,660
You don't seem troubled by their choice.

1514
01:29:19,699 --> 01:29:22,896
You prefer he be crucified by this mob?

1515
01:29:22,935 --> 01:29:25,028
John is hardly the Prince of Peace.

1516
01:29:25,071 --> 01:29:26,868
He's wanted for murder and treason.

1517
01:29:26,906 --> 01:29:29,807
Harboring him is not only immoral,
Father, it's illegal.

1518
01:29:29,842 --> 01:29:33,938
Our laws are written here, counselor,
our allegiance to God.

1519
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:34,708
You forgive me, Father,

1520
01:29:34,747 --> 01:29:37,147
but that's a bunch of cock and bull.

1521
01:29:37,183 --> 01:29:39,913
Bible bears as many interpretations
as anything else.

1522
01:29:40,953 --> 01:29:43,615
Is there a message
you wish me to pass along?

1523
01:29:43,656 --> 01:29:45,089
My case summary is tomorrow,

1524
01:29:45,124 --> 01:29:46,250
so you tell John Surratt

1525
01:29:46,292 --> 01:29:47,589
that unless he surrenders himself,

1526
01:29:47,627 --> 01:29:51,154
his mother will most likely be
punished for his crimes.

1527
01:29:55,901 --> 01:29:57,368
Mr. Aiken.

1528
01:30:10,149 --> 01:30:12,982
For the lawyer as well as the soldier,

1529
01:30:13,019 --> 01:30:16,511
there is an equally imperative command.

1530
01:30:16,555 --> 01:30:21,151
That duty is to shelter from injustice
the innocent,

1531
01:30:21,994 --> 01:30:24,394
to protect the weak from oppression

1532
01:30:24,430 --> 01:30:26,455
and, when necessity demands,

1533
01:30:26,499 --> 01:30:31,129
to rally to the defense
of those being wronged.

1534
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:37,805
After the most thorough investigation
in our nation's history,

1535
01:30:37,843 --> 01:30:40,676
the government's entire case
against Mary Surratt

1536
01:30:40,713 --> 01:30:41,702
rests on three acts--

1537
01:30:42,181 --> 01:30:44,445
one, her acquaintance with Booth,

1538
01:30:44,483 --> 01:30:47,077
two, her alleged instructions to Lloyd,

1539
01:30:47,119 --> 01:30:50,486
and, three, her nonrecognition of Payne.

1540
01:30:50,523 --> 01:30:54,755
It is these three acts
that constitute the sum total

1541
01:30:54,794 --> 01:31:00,096
of Mary Surratt's part in this
traitorous and murderous conspiracy.

1542
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,730
By themselves, they constitute no crime.

1543
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:06,661
Any one of you or I
might have done the same,

1544
01:31:06,706 --> 01:31:10,540
but the government insists
she did them with evil intent,

1545
01:31:11,343 --> 01:31:13,208
largely based on the testimony
of two men,

1546
01:31:13,245 --> 01:31:15,372
John Lloyd and Louis Weichmann.

1547
01:31:16,282 --> 01:31:20,343
Yet, at best, the actions of these men
undermine their credibility,

1548
01:31:20,386 --> 01:31:23,549
and, at worst,
they have done the unspeakable--

1549
01:31:23,589 --> 01:31:25,557
they have gained their freedom

1550
01:31:25,591 --> 01:31:29,083
by falsely accusing another
of their crime.

1551
01:31:30,229 --> 01:31:33,995
There can be no doubt as
to the principal and real reason

1552
01:31:34,033 --> 01:31:35,967
that Mary Surratt is here today.

1553
01:31:36,001 --> 01:31:38,231
It's because of her son, John Surratt.

1554
01:31:39,371 --> 01:31:41,862
He invited Booth into her home.
She did not.

1555
01:31:41,907 --> 01:31:45,308
And he hid rifles and ammunition
in Lloyd's Tavern.

1556
01:31:45,344 --> 01:31:46,811
She did not.

1557
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:49,973
If John Surratt was part
of this conspiracy,

1558
01:31:50,015 --> 01:31:52,711
I pray to God that he receives
every punishment known to man,

1559
01:31:52,752 --> 01:31:56,984
but if his mother can be convicted
on such insufficient evidence,

1560
01:31:57,022 --> 01:31:59,718
I tell you none of you are safe.

1561
01:32:02,428 --> 01:32:04,055
Members of the Commission,

1562
01:32:04,764 --> 01:32:08,131
do not permit this injustice
to Mary Surratt

1563
01:32:08,167 --> 01:32:11,967
by sacrificing our sacred rights
out of revenge.

1564
01:32:13,139 --> 01:32:16,404
Too many of us have laid down
our lives to preserve them.

1565
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,953
Gentlemen.

1566
01:32:31,557 --> 01:32:32,990
Gentlemen.

1567
01:32:35,828 --> 01:32:40,424
One bullet may have killed
our beloved president.

1568
01:32:40,466 --> 01:32:45,267
One bullet, but not one man.

1569
01:32:54,446 --> 01:32:55,811
Sit with me.

1570
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:07,216
Is there any word?

1571
01:33:09,295 --> 01:33:11,559
No. They're still deliberating.

1572
01:33:11,597 --> 01:33:14,191
I mean about my son.

1573
01:33:17,136 --> 01:33:18,660
I held him too close.

1574
01:33:22,975 --> 01:33:25,205
I didn't want John turning out
like his father,

1575
01:33:25,244 --> 01:33:26,472
so I kept him near.

1576
01:33:29,448 --> 01:33:33,612
And when the war broke out,
he wanted to enlist,

1577
01:33:34,987 --> 01:33:36,011
but I wouldn't let him.

1578
01:33:38,691 --> 01:33:42,559
My son just needed to break free...

1579
01:33:44,663 --> 01:33:45,687
be his own man.

1580
01:33:48,167 --> 01:33:50,829
And this is the way he did it.

1581
01:33:57,710 --> 01:33:59,075
All those in favor?

1582
01:34:00,179 --> 01:34:01,806
Aye.

1583
01:34:03,883 --> 01:34:06,943
Well, then, we are all agreed

1584
01:34:06,986 --> 01:34:09,750
on the penalty of death
for the prisoners

1585
01:34:09,788 --> 01:34:12,552
Herold, Atzerodt and Payne.

1586
01:34:15,561 --> 01:34:16,960
What about the woman?

1587
01:34:22,067 --> 01:34:24,331
Regarding Mary Surratt,

1588
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:27,361
all those in favor, gentlemen?

1589
01:34:44,490 --> 01:34:45,479
No.

1590
01:34:46,358 --> 01:34:48,349
Damn it!

1591
01:34:48,394 --> 01:34:49,622
No.

1592
01:34:52,464 --> 01:34:54,489
No, she must be punished
to the full extent.

1593
01:34:54,533 --> 01:34:56,933
I want these people
buried and forgotten.

1594
01:34:56,969 --> 01:35:01,303
The majority prefer
a more merciful sentence,

1595
01:35:02,608 --> 01:35:06,601
life in prison
on account of her age, gender.

1596
01:35:07,146 --> 01:35:08,272
I give Mr. Aiken credit.

1597
01:35:08,314 --> 01:35:10,942
He knew just how to use the daughter.

1598
01:35:10,983 --> 01:35:12,109
It seems so.

1599
01:35:12,151 --> 01:35:16,019
You made my sentiments known
to the Commission?

1600
01:35:16,055 --> 01:35:18,580
Their minds are made.

1601
01:35:23,028 --> 01:35:24,393
Then let us change them.

1602
01:35:36,642 --> 01:35:39,839
"After mature consideration
of the evidence,

1603
01:35:40,646 --> 01:35:43,410

Here, sir.

1620
01:37:08,534 --> 01:37:10,866
There must be something we can do.

1621
01:37:10,903 --> 01:37:12,131
You have three options:

1622
01:37:12,171 --> 01:37:14,639
Petition the president
for a stay of execution--

1623
01:37:14,673 --> 01:37:16,197
but, uh, he won't do that,

1624
01:37:16,241 --> 01:37:18,072
because if he did, people would think

1625
01:37:18,110 --> 01:37:19,668
he was part of the conspiracy.

1626
01:37:19,711 --> 01:37:23,147
Uh, two, apply for
a writ of habeas corpus

1627
01:37:23,182 --> 01:37:24,672
to retry her in a civilian court,

1628
01:37:24,716 --> 01:37:26,650
but no judge would oppose Stanton

1629
01:37:26,685 --> 01:37:28,983
or the might of the War Department.

1630
01:37:29,021 --> 01:37:32,684
Uh, and, three, John Surratt

1631
01:37:32,724 --> 01:37:35,488
shows himself before noon tomorrow.

1632
01:37:35,527 --> 01:37:37,324
Are you going somewhere?

1633
01:37:37,362 --> 01:37:39,557
I have business in Baltimore.

1634
01:37:39,598 --> 01:37:40,622
What?

1635
01:37:40,666 --> 01:37:42,600
You--You can't leave now!

1636
01:37:44,436 --> 01:37:45,596
It's over.

1637
01:37:48,874 --> 01:37:52,139
Freddie, she's not your mother.

1638
01:37:53,212 --> 01:37:55,942
If John Surratt won't
give himself up for her,

1639
01:37:56,715 --> 01:37:57,682
then why should you?

1640
01:38:04,389 --> 01:38:06,380
Freddie!

1641
01:38:06,425 --> 01:38:09,326
Frederick Sebastian Aiken,
we know you're in there!

1642
01:38:09,361 --> 01:38:11,886
Open the door now. Come on.

1643
01:38:11,930 --> 01:38:14,228
Fred--ah, there he is.

1644
01:38:14,266 --> 01:38:17,531
Well, if it isn't
the reclusive Master Aiken.

1645
01:38:18,370 --> 01:38:19,701
We thought you could use this.

1646
01:38:20,973 --> 01:38:22,838
Hamilton, how well
do you know Judge Olin?

1647
01:38:23,942 --> 01:38:24,931
What are you doing?

1648
01:38:24,977 --> 01:38:26,808
You think he'll give me
a writ of habeas corpus?

1649
01:38:26,845 --> 01:38:28,210
You can't pursue a writ.

1650
01:38:28,247 --> 01:38:29,771
They won't allow me
to appeal this verdict,

1651
01:38:29,815 --> 01:38:31,339
so I'm gonna appeal for a new trial.

1652
01:38:31,383 --> 01:38:32,907
If you do this,
you will humiliate Stanton,

1653
01:38:32,951 --> 01:38:34,384
and he will destroy you.

1654
01:38:34,419 --> 01:38:35,886
The hell with Stanton.

1655
01:38:35,921 --> 01:38:38,788
Why do you--
Why do you insist on standing by her?

1656
01:38:38,824 --> 01:38:40,587
Hey. Hey, it makes no sense.

1657
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:43,257
What they're doing to her is wrong.

1658
01:38:43,295 --> 01:38:45,855
If John Wilkes Booth himself
was tried in the same manner,

1659
01:38:45,898 --> 01:38:48,230
it would still be wrong.

1660
01:38:48,267 --> 01:38:52,761
Hamilton, she's to hang
in less than 12 hours.

1661
01:38:53,939 --> 01:38:55,463
Judge Olin's out of town.

1662
01:38:55,507 --> 01:38:57,134
He would have been my first choice.

1663
01:38:57,176 --> 01:38:58,302
What about Wylie?

1664
01:38:58,343 --> 01:38:59,742
Maybe Wylie.

1665
01:38:59,778 --> 01:39:02,679
He's, uh- -he's always been known
as a Free Thinker.

1666
01:39:02,714 --> 01:39:05,808
Yes. He's been around for ages,
but he was the closest to Lincoln.

1667
01:39:05,851 --> 01:39:06,749
Then what about Carter?

1668
01:39:06,785 --> 01:39:10,152
Not a chance. He was with Stanton
on the night of the assassination.

1669
01:39:10,189 --> 01:39:12,123
Besides, they have dinner
together once a week.

1670
01:39:12,157 --> 01:39:14,421
Then you're saying that Wylie
is my best option.

1671
01:39:14,459 --> 01:39:16,984
No. Your best option is
to stop this nonsense

1672
01:39:17,029 --> 01:39:18,724
and help us empty this bottle.

1673
01:39:18,764 --> 01:39:20,425
Better listen to the man.

1674
01:39:36,215 --> 01:39:37,273
Judge Wylie?

1675
01:39:37,983 --> 01:39:41,441
I, uh--I need to apply
for a writ of habeas corpus.

1676
01:39:42,287 --> 01:39:43,948
At this hour of the night?

1677
01:39:43,989 --> 01:39:45,388
I'm sorry, sir. It can't wait.

1678
01:39:45,424 --> 01:39:47,756
Interrupting an old man's sleep?

1679
01:39:47,793 --> 01:39:50,921
I'd say you're getting off
on the wrong foot, son.

1680
01:39:50,963 --> 01:39:52,225
It's for Mary Surratt.

1681
01:40:05,644 --> 01:40:06,668
A new trial...

1682
01:40:07,746 --> 01:40:11,443
in a civil court by a jury of her peers.

1683
01:40:11,483 --> 01:40:12,973
Is that what you want, Mr. Aiken?

1684
01:40:13,018 --> 01:40:14,485
Yes, please, Your Honor.

1685
01:40:14,519 --> 01:40:18,421
So we can relive our president's
assassination all over again.

1686
01:40:18,457 --> 01:40:19,389
That's not my intention.

1687
01:40:19,424 --> 01:40:21,051
Then to what intent?

1688
01:40:22,194 --> 01:40:24,924
Might this not result
in exactly the same thing?

1689
01:40:24,963 --> 01:40:28,990
Perhaps, but results should not be
our only measure ofjustice.

1690
01:40:29,034 --> 01:40:31,502
Are you going to lecture me on justice?

1691
01:40:31,536 --> 01:40:32,525
Sorry, sir.

1692
01:40:32,571 --> 01:40:37,133
You realize that I was personally
appointed by President Lincoln.

1693
01:40:37,175 --> 01:40:38,164
Yes.

1694
01:40:38,210 --> 01:40:40,542
And yet you still come to me.

1695
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:43,773
Forgive me, Your Honor,

1696
01:40:43,815 --> 01:40:48,411
but are we not obligated
to follow the law at all times,

1697
01:40:48,453 --> 01:40:50,045
regardless of our emotions?

1698
01:40:50,088 --> 01:40:52,113
And is this not driven by emotions?

1699
01:40:52,157 --> 01:40:53,249
Isn't that what this is all about?

1700
01:40:53,292 --> 01:40:54,987
It's about preventing injustice.

1701
01:40:56,295 --> 01:40:58,263
Now, I know that the people
are still angry.

1702
01:40:58,297 --> 01:40:59,889
Yes, they are, and so am I.

1703
01:40:59,931 --> 01:41:01,728
But I hope,
I trust that President Lincoln

1704
01:41:01,767 --> 01:41:06,864
appointed you because you hold
the Constitution sacred.

1705
01:41:06,905 --> 01:41:10,102
Whether you believe Mary Surratt
is guilty or innocent,

1706
01:41:10,142 --> 01:41:11,632
the Constitution was intended...

1707
01:41:11,677 --> 01:41:13,269
And now you're gonna
lecture me on the Constitution.

1708
01:41:13,312 --> 01:41:17,078
...to protect the rights of all citizens
at all times in peace or war.

1709
01:41:17,115 --> 01:41:18,707
And in a matter of hours,

1710
01:41:18,750 --> 01:41:22,242
it will have failed to protect her
unless you sign that writ.

1711
01:41:24,723 --> 01:41:26,054
You believe she's innocent?

1712
01:41:26,091 --> 01:41:28,787
I don't know.

1713
01:41:28,827 --> 01:41:32,695
But if we don't get a proper trial,
we never will.

1714
01:41:35,567 --> 01:41:37,034
You can't go in there! Wait!

1715
01:41:40,439 --> 01:41:43,237
I'm so sorry, Mr. Secretary.
I tried to stop him.

1716
01:41:45,177 --> 01:41:46,405
It's all right.

1717
01:41:57,155 --> 01:41:58,349
Good morning, Joseph.

1718
01:41:58,390 --> 01:41:59,448
Good morning.

1719
01:41:59,491 --> 01:42:03,860
It appears that Mr. Aiken has procured
a writ signed by Judge Wylie.

1720
01:42:03,895 --> 01:42:05,089
Good day.

1721
01:42:05,130 --> 01:42:07,928
Before you go, Captain,

1722
01:42:08,734 --> 01:42:09,758
tell me...

1723
01:42:11,136 --> 01:42:14,105
when you first learned
that our secretary of State

1724
01:42:14,139 --> 01:42:15,629
had been butchered
to within an inch of his life

1725
01:42:15,674 --> 01:42:18,700
and that they put a bullet in the back
of our president's head,

1726
01:42:18,744 --> 01:42:20,405
when this city was in chaos,

1727
01:42:20,445 --> 01:42:24,074
did you not wish to see order restored
and justice served,

1728
01:42:24,116 --> 01:42:28,519
or were you just concerned
with the rights of the assassins?

1729
01:42:28,553 --> 01:42:31,454
It's notjustice you're after.
It's revenge.

1730
01:42:32,424 --> 01:42:36,087
I would never go to such lengths
out of vengeance,

1731
01:42:36,128 --> 01:42:41,225
but to ensure the survival
of this nation, I would do anything.

1732
01:42:42,401 --> 01:42:47,202
Mary Surratt was a party to the
most grievous crime in our history.

1733
01:42:47,239 --> 01:42:52,973
Necessity demands that she be given
a swift, sure and harsh sentence.

1734
01:42:53,011 --> 01:42:57,277
l, too, hold sacred
our rights, counselor,

1735
01:42:57,315 --> 01:43:02,617
but they count not at all
if our nation ceases to exist.

1736
01:43:03,889 --> 01:43:05,516
Please see to it that Mary Surratt

1737
01:43:05,557 --> 01:43:08,856
is delivered to Judge Wylie's courtroom
no later than noon...

1738
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:09,949
sir.

1739
01:43:20,305 --> 01:43:22,136
Let's go. Come on. Stay there.

1740
01:43:33,285 --> 01:43:35,344
You will have to stand trial again,

1741
01:43:35,387 --> 01:43:38,117
but it will be a civilian trial.

1742
01:43:38,156 --> 01:43:39,418
And a civilian trial has no generals.

1743
01:43:39,458 --> 01:43:40,789
That's correct. No generals.

1744
01:43:42,828 --> 01:43:44,227
Bless you, son.

1745
01:43:44,262 --> 01:43:45,752
Bless you.

1746
01:43:50,068 --> 01:43:51,467
Oh, Mama.

1747
01:43:51,503 --> 01:43:52,527
Anna.

1748
01:43:58,477 --> 01:44:00,604
Should only be three.

1749
01:44:05,116 --> 01:44:06,242
It's time, ma'am.

1750
01:44:07,486 --> 01:44:08,748
What are you doing?

1751
01:44:08,787 --> 01:44:10,482
We need to prepare her with the others.

1752
01:44:10,522 --> 01:44:14,049
No. No, she is to be transferred
to Judge Wylie's court.

1753
01:44:14,092 --> 01:44:16,390
I advise sedating the young lady.

1754
01:44:16,428 --> 01:44:17,861
You'll do no such thing.

1755
01:44:17,896 --> 01:44:21,798
Anna. I have procured a writ
that says she is to get a new trial.

1756
01:44:24,369 --> 01:44:26,428
Presidentjust suspended your writ.

1757
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:33,809
I'm sorry.

1758
01:44:33,845 --> 01:44:35,608
She's to hang with the others.

1759
01:44:35,647 --> 01:44:36,636
No.

1760
01:44:36,681 --> 01:44:38,774
No. Frederick, do something.

1761
01:44:40,452 --> 01:44:42,784
I--

1762
01:44:42,821 --> 01:44:44,948
I'm so sorry.

1763
01:44:44,990 --> 01:44:46,457
Oh, no.

1764
01:44:46,491 --> 01:44:47,958
No. No, no, no, no.

1765
01:44:47,993 --> 01:44:49,290
No, Mama. No. No, Mama. No.

1766
01:44:49,327 --> 01:44:50,794
I'll always be with you.

1767
01:44:50,829 --> 01:44:53,923
No! No! Oh, Mama, no!

1768
01:44:53,965 --> 01:44:56,229
I love you, Anna. I love you.

1769
01:44:56,268 --> 01:44:57,633
No!

1770
01:44:57,669 --> 01:44:59,762
Oh, God, no!

1771
01:45:01,273 --> 01:45:03,264
Mama!

1772
01:45:23,261 --> 01:45:26,753
Inter arma, silent leges.

1773
01:45:28,466 --> 01:45:31,697
"In times of war, the law falls silent."

1774
01:45:32,370 --> 01:45:33,928
It shouldn't.

1775
01:45:38,376 --> 01:45:42,813
Word is the last Confederate general
surrendered to Union troops.

1776
01:45:42,847 --> 01:45:44,144
Peace.

1777
01:45:44,182 --> 01:45:45,649
Peace at last.

1778
01:47:58,116 --> 01:47:59,947
I am hereby commanded

1779
01:47:59,984 --> 01:48:01,781
to cause David E. Herold,

1780
01:48:01,820 --> 01:48:03,583
G. A. Atzerodt,

1781
01:48:03,621 --> 01:48:05,316
Lewis Payne

1782
01:48:05,356 --> 01:48:08,291
and Mary E. Surratt

1783
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:10,721
to be executed

1784
01:48:10,762 --> 01:48:14,061
in accordance with the order
of the president of the United States,

1785
01:48:14,099 --> 01:48:15,396
Andrew Johnson.

1786
01:48:25,577 --> 01:48:27,340
The Almighty God bless you.

1787
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:10,581
Stand your prisoners up.

1788
01:49:13,992 --> 01:49:15,220
Step them to the noose.

1789
01:51:00,031 --> 01:51:01,020
Okay, sir. I'll show you where he's at--

1790
01:51:01,065 --> 01:51:02,430
No, I know the way.

1791
01:51:24,222 --> 01:51:25,917
Mr. Aiken.

1792
01:51:27,592 --> 01:51:29,355
I didn't think you'd come.

1793
01:51:29,394 --> 01:51:31,885
I don't know what help I can be to you.

1794
01:51:32,830 --> 01:51:34,320
I've left the law.

1795
01:51:35,133 --> 01:51:36,191
I just wanted to thank you

1796
01:51:36,234 --> 01:51:38,725
for the kindness
that you showed my mother.

1797
01:51:40,104 --> 01:51:41,901
Believe me, Mr. Aiken,

1798
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:43,931
I never thought they'd kill her.

1799
01:51:55,086 --> 01:51:57,680
Father Walter asked
that I give you these.

1800
01:51:58,856 --> 01:52:00,585
They were your mother's.

1801
01:52:03,161 --> 01:52:06,221
I hope they can be
of some comfort to you.

1802
01:52:08,199 --> 01:52:09,632
They belong to you.

1803
01:52:11,803 --> 01:52:14,135
You were more of a son to her
than I ever was.

1804
01:52:24,716 --> 01:52:25,774
Thank you.
