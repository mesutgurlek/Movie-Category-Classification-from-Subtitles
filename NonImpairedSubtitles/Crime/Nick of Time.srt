00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:43,273
Ms Joan Beary...

12
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:47,064
What you doing?
You know you can't skate in here.

13
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:50,523
This is George. Where you at?

14
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:53,814
Get your ass outta here.
What you doing in here?

15
00:04:56,689 --> 00:05:00,523
Come on, you're leaving your bags.

16
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:02,606
That one. Right there.

17
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,273
No. Hates his wife.

18
00:05:05,481 --> 00:05:09,106
- Damn!
- Man, I hate rollerbladers.

19
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:12,023
Skateboarders I don't mind,
though they dress like idiots,

20
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:16,314
but when I see rollerbladers, I want
to grease the front of my car with them.

21
00:05:16,523 --> 00:05:19,606
Keep your eyes peeled.

22
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:34,689
Lynn, honey.

23
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:41,439
Lynn. Don't run off, now, sweetpea.
Stay close to Daddy, OK?

24
00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:43,273
OK.

25
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:46,856
- We made it.
- We made it.

26
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:50,856
What about them?
Right there.

27
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,523
- Too old.
- Them?

28
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:03,231
You've no idea. Leave it to me. I know
people. Is my job. I'm a people person.

29
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,731
What are you looking for, huh?

30
00:06:10,023 --> 00:06:14,273
- I'm looking for them, right there.
- Where?

31
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:16,106
Oh, yeah. I see.

32
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:23,023
Honey, I gotta make a phone call.
Can you see a phone anywhere?

33
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:34,939
Hey, come on, you. Didn't you ever
see anybody kiss like that before?

34
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:36,689
On TV.

35
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:40,939
You never saw your mum
and me kiss like that?

36
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:42,773
Hey.

37
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:49,231
Listen to me. Is all right to talk
about it. You know that, don't you?

38
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,731
All right. Tell me, you never
saw your mum and me kiss like that?

39
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:58,106
- No way.
- Not once? How did you see us kiss?

40
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:02,856
Thas it? That little peck of a kiss?

41
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:08,106
Honey, you missed
a whole lot of kisses. Come here.

42
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:16,356
Oh, God, honey.
Daddy's late. We gotta go.

43
00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:20,773
- Look. He'd do anything for her.
- Young love.

44
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:30,773
Fuck me. Foreigners.

45
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:34,648
Frogs. They copy our jeans,
but didn't help us in Kuwait.

46
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:41,189
- Look at that.
- Hi, Mr Conners, Gene Watson...

47
00:07:41,398 --> 00:07:43,606
Give me that little teddy bear, huh?

48
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:45,314
One second.
Hey!

49
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:49,939
Hey. Honey, come here.
Come here, sweetheart.

50
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:52,523
You stay away from her.

51
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:55,898
Come here.
Sorry about that, sir.

52
00:07:56,106 --> 00:07:58,564
- I want the teddy.
- Stay close.

53
00:07:58,773 --> 00:08:04,648
Some guys on roller-skates. I'm running
late, but l'll get there as soon as I can.

54
00:08:04,856 --> 00:08:09,648
- Yo, punk. Check this out.
- Get outta here. Leave her alone.

55
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,981
Bye.
You ready, sweets?

56
00:08:13,564 --> 00:08:15,439
Les do it.
Oops!

57
00:08:16,648 --> 00:08:17,981
You see...

58
00:08:21,523 --> 00:08:24,148
Thas why you
should always wear a helmet.

59
00:08:24,356 --> 00:08:27,314
You never know
when you're gonna fall down, right?

60
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:31,689
- Right.
- Come on. Les get outta here.

61
00:08:32,189 --> 00:08:34,814
Watch your step. Come on.

62
00:08:35,023 --> 00:08:37,689
- Is perfect.
- Perfect.

63
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:43,481
- Can I see some identification?
- Excuse me?

64
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:50,648
- ID. Can we see some?
- Sure. Sure. Driver's licence all right?

65
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:55,981
- Fine.
- Whas the problem? Oh, those guys...

66
00:08:56,189 --> 00:08:58,731
- You're from Santa Maria?
- Yes.

67
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,773
- Where's that?
- North, near Lompoc. Why?

68
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:03,564
Come with us, sir.

69
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:07,231
- Whas going on?
- Don't cause a ruckus.

70
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:11,231
- Come with me.
- Ma'am, l'll take my daughter.

71
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:13,814
Don't worry.
My partner's good with kids.

72
00:09:15,731 --> 00:09:18,523
- You stole that.
- No, I confiscated it.

73
00:09:18,773 --> 00:09:20,689
- There's a difference.
- No, there's not.

74
00:09:20,898 --> 00:09:22,648
- Whas going on?
- L'll explain.

75
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:35,148
Officer, whas going on?

76
00:09:38,314 --> 00:09:41,398
Get the front seat.

77
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:45,189
Into the van, Mr Watson, thank you.

78
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:54,439
Les get your seat-belt on. Always
wanna wear your seat-belt. Right?

79
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:56,939
- I want my daddy.
- He's right there.

80
00:09:57,148 --> 00:09:59,273
- Daddy's here.
- We're Daddy's friends.

81
00:09:59,523 --> 00:10:03,106
Thas right. A policeman's
your friend. Isn't that right, Daddy?

82
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:08,564
- Daddy?
- Thas right. Police are our friends.

83
00:10:08,814 --> 00:10:12,773
I have an appointment.
I'd like to know whas going on.

84
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:16,481
- This is the jack. Say, "Hi, Jack".
- Hi, Jack.

85
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:21,398
- And this goes in this little hole.
- Let me do it.

86
00:10:22,148 --> 00:10:26,439
- Is loud.
- Les get down to business.

87
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:34,481
- Who are you people?
- Pay attention, Mr Watson.

88
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:36,814
And your daughter won't be hurt.

89
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:38,898
Honey, come to Daddy.

90
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,439
Mr Watson,
you're not paying attention.

91
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:47,648
Your daughter's life depends on you.
Do you understand?

92
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:52,689
- Do you understand that?
- Yes.

93
00:10:52,898 --> 00:10:56,398
Good.
This is for you.

94
00:10:56,648 --> 00:11:01,398
In it there's a picture of a woman
and an itinerary. Is her itinerary.

95
00:11:01,648 --> 00:11:05,898
- She is presently... You listening?
- Yes.

96
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:10,398
She is presently at the Bonaventure
Hotel. Is not far from here.

97
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:14,189
When you leave this van,
you'll get yourself a taxi

98
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:16,398
to the Bonaventure Hotel.

99
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:21,398
Then you'll take this and kill
the woman whose picture's in there.

100
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:23,689
Not just shoot her, kill her.

101
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:27,148
I recommend you
empty the gun into her close up.

102
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,981
You got all that?

103
00:11:33,148 --> 00:11:36,564
- You're out of your mind.
- Whas your point?

104
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:42,064
- I will do no such thing.
- Yes, you will, Mr Watson.

105
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:47,439
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of the kid.

106
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:56,189
Is now 12.16. If the woman
in the picture is alive at 1.30,

107
00:11:56,398 --> 00:11:58,648
I call my partner,
your daughter's dead.

108
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:05,439
- What if I don't call you?
- I kill her anyway.

109
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:07,273
Hear that, Mr Watson?

110
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:16,439
Do you understand? Ls the woman
in the picture, or your daughter.

111
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:21,148
- My God!
- God can't help her. Only you can.

112
00:12:21,398 --> 00:12:25,523
- Only you.
- You're wasting time.

113
00:12:46,106 --> 00:12:51,564
- Les go.
- Honey, Daddy has to go somewhere.

114
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:56,023
L'll be back soon. OK?
Stay with the nice lady.

115
00:12:57,231 --> 00:12:58,648
Move it.

116
00:13:02,606 --> 00:13:05,606
- Les test this. Are you on?
- Read you.

117
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:09,523
You'll need some cash.

118
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:11,856
There you go.

119
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:18,273
L'll hang on to the wallet
for the time being. You'll need these.

120
00:13:23,356 --> 00:13:28,023
Cabs are that way. Get moving,
Mr Watson. Time's a-wasting.

121
00:13:28,856 --> 00:13:31,314
Les do it.

122
00:13:37,273 --> 00:13:39,481
Where's my daddy going?

123
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:41,773
He's going to be a hero.

124
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:45,439
- Like "Power Rangers"?
- Yeah, just like "Power Rangers".

125
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:52,564
Check you in about an hour.

126
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:05,231
Officer...

127
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:14,398
You talk to a cop, even look at one
too long, your daughter's dead.

128
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:17,814
- Get over there. Just do it.
- Go ahead, sugar-pie.

129
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:21,606
Lynn calling Daddy. Come in, Daddy.

130
00:15:21,856 --> 00:15:23,939
- Lynn.
- I can hear you good.

131
00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:28,064
- Can you hear me?
- Yes. Where are you?

132
00:15:28,231 --> 00:15:32,564
- Are you OK?
- Thas enough. Daddy has to go now.

133
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:37,273
- Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
- Over and out.

134
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:39,356
Look at your watch.

135
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:43,731
At 1.30 your little girl is dead.
Say it with me. My little girl is dead.

136
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:46,023
Say it. Say it. Name it.

137
00:15:47,856 --> 00:15:52,606
- At 1.30 my little girl is dead.
- Unless you do what you're told.

138
00:15:52,814 --> 00:15:56,106
You go do it.

139
00:15:58,981 --> 00:16:00,648
Remember, l'll be watching.

140
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:10,189
I need to get to the Bonaventure Hotel.

141
00:16:10,356 --> 00:16:14,106
- Bonaventure?
- Know where that is?

142
00:16:14,314 --> 00:16:16,981
I can see it from here.

143
00:16:28,814 --> 00:16:31,523
- Amtrak?
- Huh?

144
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:37,189
- What did you come in on, Amtrak?
- Oh... Yeah.

145
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:39,273
Business or pleasure?

146
00:16:40,523 --> 00:16:42,398
Business.

147
00:16:42,606 --> 00:16:45,856
- Where did you come in from?
- What?

148
00:16:46,064 --> 00:16:49,689
- Where did you come in from?
- San Diego.

149
00:16:49,898 --> 00:16:54,898
Ah, San Diego. I thought
about moving down to San Diego.

150
00:16:55,106 --> 00:17:02,314
Is hard to make a living in this town.
With short hops you can't make a dime.

151
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:12,314
- What do you think?
- About what?

152
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:15,189
San Diego.
Better opportunities there or what?

153
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:20,856
I wouldn't know. I don't live there.
I just went down there for a funeral.

154
00:17:21,064 --> 00:17:22,398
Somebody close?

155
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:27,648
- Excuse me?
- Was it somebody close to you?

156
00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:31,606
Yeah. Yes. It was my wife.

157
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:34,564
Well, ex-wife.

158
00:17:34,773 --> 00:17:37,731
Soon-to-be ex.
She wanted a divorce.

159
00:17:37,939 --> 00:17:43,148
Listen, I've got a problem.
I've got a really big problem.

160
00:17:43,356 --> 00:17:44,689
Oh, yeah?

161
00:17:47,814 --> 00:17:49,856
Maniac, what are you doing?

162
00:17:51,898 --> 00:17:53,231
Sorry about that.

163
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:17,981
I'd like to hear about your problem,
but the ride's over. Thas $3.50.

164
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:23,606
I hope your problem's
got nothing to do with my $3.50.

165
00:18:23,814 --> 00:18:25,981
No, no.

166
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,231
Are you writing a cheque?

167
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:11,064
- Thank you very much.
- All right. Thank you.

168
00:19:11,273 --> 00:19:13,564
I got you, sir. Right here.

169
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:16,231
- One for the airport. You free?
- You betcha.

170
00:19:20,481 --> 00:19:25,064
Public accountant?
What do I need with an accountant?

171
00:19:25,273 --> 00:19:26,814
Hello.

172
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:11,939
Ben! Ben!

173
00:20:14,231 --> 00:20:17,314
Coming on down, coming in.

174
00:20:18,398 --> 00:20:20,314
Let it go.

175
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:42,814
Oh, shit.

176
00:20:59,398 --> 00:21:02,773
Can you tell me where
the Emerald Bay Room is?

177
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:06,273
Third floor, yellow stairwell.
Follow the signs.

178
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:08,939
- Thank you.
- No problem.

179
00:21:28,773 --> 00:21:32,481
The governor and I have an enormous
admiration for people like you...

180
00:21:32,731 --> 00:21:35,606
- I'm sorry. You OK?
- Yeah.

181
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:37,939
Sure? Nice body-check!

182
00:21:38,148 --> 00:21:42,648
Anyway, is illuminating, is inspiring...

183
00:21:52,356 --> 00:21:55,356
Excuse me, ma'am, is the thing over?

184
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,939
You didn't miss anything.
The food, soggy pancakes...

185
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:04,481
- I guess the governor's gone.
- Nice speech. Is always the same.

186
00:22:06,231 --> 00:22:10,231
OK. Just check that itinerary
and move along.

187
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:12,398
Is right here.

188
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:14,814
That says "lnvitation only".

189
00:22:15,064 --> 00:22:19,564
You're a big donor to the campaign.
Of course you're invited. They love you.

190
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:22,189
Thall get you in anywhere.

191
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:25,814
Who are you?

192
00:22:26,689 --> 00:22:31,773
The guy who's gonna kill your
daughter if you don't get moving.

193
00:22:42,689 --> 00:22:46,356
Nobody heard a word I said.
The mic was low.

194
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:50,273
- How much was that room?
- We didn't pay.

195
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:52,231
Well, somebody did.

196
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:56,231
Make sure you have
Melvyn pre-check the PA system.

197
00:23:13,564 --> 00:23:16,564
This elevator's for the governor.
Take the next one.

198
00:23:16,731 --> 00:23:21,773
No, Franco. This is one of our biggest
contributors. Look at the name tag.

199
00:23:21,981 --> 00:23:25,148
Come on in, is OK.

200
00:23:27,814 --> 00:23:30,106
Hi, Eleanor Grant,
gubernatorial incumbent.

201
00:23:30,314 --> 00:23:32,481
Is a mouthful. I love saying it.

202
00:23:34,773 --> 00:23:37,064
Who scheduled
lunch right after brunch?

203
00:23:37,273 --> 00:23:40,231
We'll just walk through
and get ready for the press...

204
00:23:41,606 --> 00:23:43,648
- Governor?
- Yes.

205
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:48,648
- I need your help.
- What can I do for you?

206
00:23:48,898 --> 00:23:52,148
- Is about my daughter...
- Room for one more?

207
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:56,564
- I think so.
- Is a pleasure, Governor.

208
00:23:56,773 --> 00:23:59,564
Well, thank you very much.

209
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,898
You were saying...

210
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:06,273
Your daughter.

211
00:24:07,564 --> 00:24:09,189
Yes?

212
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:11,439
Well...

213
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:16,523
She just wanted me to be sure
I got your autograph.

214
00:24:19,606 --> 00:24:22,481
Of course!
I wish everything were that easy.

215
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:27,564
I've got the pen if you've got the paper.
How about that? Ls it precious?

216
00:24:30,189 --> 00:24:31,856
No.

217
00:24:38,773 --> 00:24:40,314
Her name?

218
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:52,814
- Her name?
- Lynn. Her name is Lynn.

219
00:25:03,856 --> 00:25:06,648
I don't even keep a pad anymore.

220
00:25:06,856 --> 00:25:10,564
Everything's gone so electronic.

221
00:25:12,898 --> 00:25:15,439
Are you all right?

222
00:25:15,689 --> 00:25:20,106
I know.
Elevators make me queasy, too. Here.

223
00:25:21,023 --> 00:25:23,564
Good luck.
All right, here we go.

224
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,773
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

225
00:25:31,148 --> 00:25:34,023
She was right in front of you.
Whas wrong with you?

226
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:38,231
Are you fucking with me?
Get up there.

227
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:41,981
- The gun isn't loaded.
- Is not? Give it to me.

228
00:25:45,939 --> 00:25:48,064
You don't get chances like that.

229
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:52,939
Mr Watson. Thas the way life works.
Turn around.

230
00:25:54,189 --> 00:25:55,898
Now look at that.

231
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,939
You see that?

232
00:26:00,648 --> 00:26:03,981
You will not blow the next one.

233
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:06,773
Hear me? All right.

234
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:12,064
Is loaded.
Is ready for the hunt and so are we.

235
00:26:12,273 --> 00:26:14,273
Sorry I hit you.

236
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:16,898
Yeah.

237
00:26:17,106 --> 00:26:20,731
Breathe deep.
Les go.

238
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:23,731
- I need a restroom.
- Is that way.

239
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:52,814
You having a rough day?
Down at the heels, as they say?

240
00:26:53,023 --> 00:26:58,773
You don't see your face, you don't pay.
What you need is a shoeshine.

241
00:27:08,981 --> 00:27:12,648
- Thas pretty good.
- I've done much better ones.

242
00:27:12,856 --> 00:27:15,814
- You have?
- Yes, l'll show you.

243
00:27:16,023 --> 00:27:20,356
- I have much more colours at home.
- Thas good.

244
00:27:21,981 --> 00:27:23,481
Thas good, sweetie-pie.

245
00:27:44,064 --> 00:27:45,773
Les go.

246
00:27:57,273 --> 00:28:01,731
Shoeshine today.
Take ten. Take a break.

247
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:04,148
Take a seat. Take a load off.

248
00:28:04,356 --> 00:28:07,814
What you need is a shoeshine.
Come on, take ten.

249
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:12,898
Take a break. Take a load off.
Put the world in perspective.

250
00:28:13,148 --> 00:28:18,689
- So are you a visitor?
- No, I'm just visiting.

251
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:22,023
What do you do?
Lf I may be so bold.

252
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:24,273
- Sorry?
- What do you do?

253
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:29,939
- I'm an accountant.
- Don't denigrate yourself.

254
00:28:30,148 --> 00:28:32,398
Where would the government be
without accountants?

255
00:28:32,648 --> 00:28:36,523
They wouldn't know how hard they
could squeeze us. Right?

256
00:28:36,773 --> 00:28:38,314
Take tips.

257
00:28:38,481 --> 00:28:42,023
Time was, a tip was between a man
and his customer.

258
00:28:42,231 --> 00:28:45,648
Not anymore.
They've figured out a formula.

259
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:49,564
They take your sales
and slap a percentile on them.

260
00:28:49,773 --> 00:28:53,231
Somewhere between
your lies and your bad luck,

261
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:56,023
they'll hit on the "mean amount",
meaning "in the middle".

262
00:28:56,231 --> 00:28:58,314
I think it means just plain mean.

263
00:28:58,523 --> 00:29:01,606
You can have Scrooge wring a nickel
over your palm,

264
00:29:01,814 --> 00:29:05,231
or Daddy Warbucks dropping pearl
stickpins, makes no difference.

265
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:09,523
They'll tax your behind
according to that same formula.

266
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:13,856
- Doesn't seem right.
- Hey, Mr Huey.

267
00:29:14,064 --> 00:29:17,648
- How's it going?
- Is a load, but someone must carry it.

268
00:29:21,564 --> 00:29:27,314
Sir, sir. I need your help.

269
00:29:27,731 --> 00:29:30,106
Whas that?
You'll have to speak up.

270
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:38,106
There's a little girl in a van.
She's my daughter.

271
00:29:38,314 --> 00:29:42,773
I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that
and my wooden leg, I'm all messed up.

272
00:29:43,023 --> 00:29:46,023
Compliments of the US Army
Artillery Corps.

273
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:47,939
Listen to me.

274
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:52,148
A man and a woman
were at the train.

275
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:56,731
They showed me a badge
then took her away from me.

276
00:29:56,898 --> 00:30:02,689
They took her because they want me to
do something for them. She's in trouble.

277
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:04,856
You'll be out of here right away.

278
00:30:18,148 --> 00:30:23,398
Please, I don't have much time.
I need your help.

279
00:30:26,564 --> 00:30:29,398
- He's watching me.
- Who is?

280
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:32,439
The man.

281
00:30:34,064 --> 00:30:40,106
You know, for a quality shoe, you can't
beat a good wing-tip. It wears like iron.

282
00:30:40,314 --> 00:30:45,523
You're a wise man.
There you go. Two bucks'll do you.

283
00:30:54,606 --> 00:30:56,231
- Got anything smaller?
- Keep it.

284
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:58,148
- $20?
- Is fine.

285
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,273
- What street is that?
- Flower.

286
00:31:00,523 --> 00:31:03,023
Go past the bar.
Takes you right there.

287
00:31:07,064 --> 00:31:08,439
Do me a favour.

288
00:31:11,023 --> 00:31:14,606
If anything happens to me,
remember the van.

289
00:31:16,023 --> 00:31:18,314
She's in the van.

290
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,023
- Ten minutes, you get another chance.
- Good. I've time for a drink.

291
00:31:24,231 --> 00:31:29,689
All right. Make it just one, Mr Watson,
wouldn't want to lose you.

292
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:57,231
- So where was I?
- The governor's new regime.

293
00:31:57,439 --> 00:32:01,689
Oh, yeah, she's dumping the good old
boys faster than yesterday's papers.

294
00:32:01,898 --> 00:32:06,106
- No wonder they're howling.
- They'd no idea she'd turn into a liberal.

295
00:32:06,314 --> 00:32:07,814
They're pissed, huh?

296
00:32:08,814 --> 00:32:13,814
She's turned her office into the United
Nations. They're gonna make her pay.

297
00:32:14,064 --> 00:32:16,481
Fuck with this bunch,
they'll blow you away.

298
00:32:18,231 --> 00:32:20,148
Thas right.

299
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:25,314
Right. The only people not on her staff
are those still lost in the rainforest.

300
00:32:25,523 --> 00:32:28,523
Who are these people?
They don't represent you and me.

301
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:03,356
You'll wake the baby.

302
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:11,398
We have what they call
a "Mexican stand-off".

303
00:33:12,356 --> 00:33:17,939
Now, the thing you've got to ask
yourself is, whas behind the seat?

304
00:33:19,314 --> 00:33:21,939
A.22 would go right through it.

305
00:33:22,148 --> 00:33:25,814
Even a button will deflect a.22,
so it could get screwed up

306
00:33:26,023 --> 00:33:29,064
somewhere along the way
and miss the target.

307
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,814
What about a.38?

308
00:33:31,023 --> 00:33:35,648
A.38 will drill straight
unless it hits metal.

309
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:40,648
Then ill bust up into little pieces.
Ill keep going.

310
00:33:40,856 --> 00:33:42,814
But ill get slowed down.

311
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:44,814
How's about a.357?

312
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:49,064
Thall go through the seat,
her, the dashboard...

313
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:54,231
Shit, ill go through the entire engine
before it even knows it hit anything.

314
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:59,023
Ill end up in some pedestrian
three blocks away.

315
00:33:59,189 --> 00:34:03,064
What do you think?
What is my poison?

316
00:34:14,106 --> 00:34:18,439
Is a comfort to know you've got
the cojones to pull that thing out.

317
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:25,564
Whether or not you've got the balls
to pull the trigger, we've still gotta see.

318
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,731
Close the door. Is hot outside.

319
00:34:50,564 --> 00:34:51,898
He's coming back in.

320
00:34:56,564 --> 00:35:00,148
I got him in the cross-hairs.

321
00:35:04,814 --> 00:35:09,314
- Excuse me, where's the pool deck?
- Fourth floor. Take that escalator.

322
00:35:45,898 --> 00:35:49,314
Take positions near the stage.

323
00:35:51,523 --> 00:35:54,939
Keep your eyes open.
Les have a safe day.

324
00:35:55,189 --> 00:35:56,981
You got it.

325
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:12,356
- Do you have metal in there?
- My keys.

326
00:36:12,564 --> 00:36:16,731
May I see them?
Thank you.

327
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:22,731
Sir, I can take you down here.
You don't have to wait.

328
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:29,648
Sir. Yes, you. I can take you
down here. Come on down.

329
00:37:01,023 --> 00:37:03,398
OK, you're done.
You can move on.

330
00:37:09,606 --> 00:37:11,064
Right here.

331
00:37:18,273 --> 00:37:24,189
- Sir, they're all in place.
- Check the entryway over here.

332
00:37:34,523 --> 00:37:35,981
Officer.

333
00:37:36,148 --> 00:37:37,606
I know what you're thinking.

334
00:37:37,814 --> 00:37:42,398
You're like a worm on a hook, wiggling
around thinking you might get off.

335
00:37:42,606 --> 00:37:46,106
- What would you do?
- She'd be dead. Do as you're told.

336
00:37:46,314 --> 00:37:48,564
You do it now.

337
00:37:51,273 --> 00:37:53,273
Whoa, what are you doing?

338
00:37:57,523 --> 00:38:00,023
- Officer.
- Yeah.

339
00:38:00,231 --> 00:38:02,231
There's a plot to kill the governor.

340
00:38:02,439 --> 00:38:07,606
If you don't believe me, check that man.
He has a gun.

341
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,189
So do you, Mr Watson.

342
00:38:22,148 --> 00:38:23,981
- Got this under control?
- Yeah.

343
00:38:24,231 --> 00:38:28,481
- Sure doesn't look like it.
- Well, is under control.

344
00:38:28,689 --> 00:38:33,564
Well, it better be,
'cause I'm running out of these.

345
00:38:46,731 --> 00:38:50,439
I should throw you after that
walkie-talkie, but I'm giving you a break

346
00:38:50,648 --> 00:38:52,731
'cause you're amateur.

347
00:38:54,148 --> 00:38:56,356
- Gentlemen?
- Yeah, thanks.

348
00:38:59,356 --> 00:39:02,481
Have a cracker, Mr Watson.
Thank you.

349
00:39:05,481 --> 00:39:07,273
You got spunk.

350
00:39:12,814 --> 00:39:15,106
There was this guy,

351
00:39:15,356 --> 00:39:21,398
big guy, lrish-ltalian, red face,
black hair, jolly son of a bitch.

352
00:39:21,606 --> 00:39:27,023
Nobody could make me laugh like him.
Made a science out of collecting jokes.

353
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:30,773
Closed more bars together
than I could count.

354
00:39:30,981 --> 00:39:33,023
He was a pal.

355
00:39:34,314 --> 00:39:40,814
I loved the crazy Mick. I'm not ashamed
to say that, but he was a fuck-up.

356
00:39:41,023 --> 00:39:46,148
He had this image of himself.
He thought he was a con man.

357
00:39:46,398 --> 00:39:51,356
Always trying to shave the edge.
He was nickel and dime.

358
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:55,564
L'll always miss him.
Tell me why.

359
00:39:56,398 --> 00:40:01,231
- Tell you why what?
- Tell me why I miss him.

360
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:03,356
- He's dead?
- Thas right.

361
00:40:03,564 --> 00:40:07,773
- But tell me why.
- How do I know?

362
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:10,231
Tell me why he's dead.

363
00:40:12,439 --> 00:40:15,314
- 'Cause you killed him.
- Thas right.

364
00:40:15,564 --> 00:40:22,314
He fucked up once too often, so I put a
bullet in his eye, two more to be sure.

365
00:40:22,523 --> 00:40:25,564
Now, that was somebody I loved.
I loved him.

366
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:29,273
But I got the call,
I put him down like a sick animal.

367
00:40:31,356 --> 00:40:38,189
So if you got doubts
about whas gonna happen

368
00:40:38,356 --> 00:40:42,023
if you don't deliver,
let me tell you something.

369
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,231
L'll make gravy out of your little girl,

370
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:48,314
just to season that black lrish
cocksucker's meat.

371
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:52,648
You do what you're supposed to do.

372
00:40:56,189 --> 00:40:58,439
You do it now.

373
00:41:38,856 --> 00:41:41,856
May I have your attention, please.

374
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:44,981
Les give a warm welcome
to the honourable Tom Bradley.

375
00:42:14,731 --> 00:42:17,148
- Hi.
- Hi.

376
00:42:18,564 --> 00:42:20,981
Are you feeling better?

377
00:42:21,731 --> 00:42:24,731
The elevator, you weren't feeling well.
Better now?

378
00:42:25,398 --> 00:42:28,731
Oh, yeah, much better, thanks.

379
00:42:28,939 --> 00:42:32,189
I give you now, my friend and yours,

380
00:42:32,981 --> 00:42:35,398
Governor Eleanor Grant.

381
00:42:38,064 --> 00:42:44,148
You know something, my wife always
said I had a problem trusting people.

382
00:42:49,023 --> 00:42:51,439
Thank you, Tom,
for that lovely introduction.

383
00:42:52,106 --> 00:42:55,898
- You can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
- Yeah.

384
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:59,148
Well, I'm going to trust you.

385
00:43:01,773 --> 00:43:06,689
- You're going to trust me.
- I don't understand.

386
00:43:06,939 --> 00:43:11,273
Listen, I don't want to hurt you,
but my little girl needs your help.

387
00:43:11,481 --> 00:43:13,939
She's going to die if you don't help me.

388
00:43:14,148 --> 00:43:19,898
OK, l'll help you. Let me just get
Mr White. He's our head of security.

389
00:43:20,148 --> 00:43:25,148
No, everything's fine, just take a walk
with me. Right this way.

390
00:43:30,481 --> 00:43:37,481
As it is, this is not the life I want
for our children, for myself and for you.

391
00:43:37,689 --> 00:43:39,898
I'm putting the gun back in my pocket,

392
00:43:40,106 --> 00:43:42,773
but don't try anything,
'cause is still pointing at you.

393
00:43:44,273 --> 00:43:46,481
Just pretend nothing's happening.

394
00:43:46,731 --> 00:43:49,481
My daughter's been kidnapped.

395
00:43:49,773 --> 00:43:55,398
They say they're going to kill her
if I don't kill the governor. I don't want to.

396
00:43:55,606 --> 00:43:58,439
- Les talk to security.
- No.

397
00:43:58,648 --> 00:44:01,106
We can't talk to security,
they're involved.

398
00:44:01,314 --> 00:44:04,814
I don't see how they could be.
They're handpicked.

399
00:44:05,064 --> 00:44:08,856
Well, how did I get in here with this?

400
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,564
I don't know.

401
00:44:11,773 --> 00:44:15,106
If you don't help me,
the governor will be dead.

402
00:44:15,564 --> 00:44:20,064
- Please, trust me.
- Is a little hard in the circumstances.

403
00:44:21,398 --> 00:44:23,814
All right then, here.

404
00:44:25,773 --> 00:44:30,398
- Do you trust me now?
- I guess l'll have to.

405
00:44:30,648 --> 00:44:37,189
- Well, good.
- OK, there's one person we can go to.

406
00:44:37,398 --> 00:44:40,648
We can't. The guy following
me has eyes in the back of his head.

407
00:44:40,856 --> 00:44:43,439
If he sees I'm not here,
my daughter's dead.

408
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:48,106
He'll think you're in the crowd
until the end of the speech. Wait.

409
00:44:50,856 --> 00:44:53,856
- We got about ten minutes.
- You sure?

410
00:44:54,064 --> 00:44:56,689
Yeah, I know this speech.
Come on.

411
00:44:56,898 --> 00:44:58,231
No, wait.

412
00:44:58,439 --> 00:45:02,773
Hey, trust me. You asked for my help.
Let me help. Come on.

413
00:45:02,981 --> 00:45:06,898
- Listen, put that thing away.
- Oh, yeah.

414
00:45:07,981 --> 00:45:10,106
OK.

415
00:45:10,356 --> 00:45:15,606
...control crime and prove that
communities do belong to the people.

416
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:35,648
...and change a perverted system
that lets us carry guns to school,

417
00:45:35,898 --> 00:45:37,689
but forbids us to pray there.

418
00:45:39,898 --> 00:45:43,689
Education is the key...

419
00:46:08,023 --> 00:46:11,523
- Is he in?
- Yes, ma'am.

420
00:46:11,689 --> 00:46:13,439
Can we trust these people?

421
00:46:13,689 --> 00:46:17,398
Is her husband,
he's her campaign manager.

422
00:46:20,898 --> 00:46:23,898
- Is there a problem?
- We need to see you.

423
00:46:24,106 --> 00:46:28,189
- Aren't you supposed to be downstairs?
- We gotta hurry.

424
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:33,773
- Someone's trying to kill Eleanor.
- What are you talking about?

425
00:46:34,023 --> 00:46:36,273
We need people we can trust.

426
00:46:36,481 --> 00:46:38,314
How do you know that?

427
00:46:38,523 --> 00:46:41,189
Because I'm supposed to kill her.

428
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:43,773
- You're supposed to kill my wife?
- Right.

429
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:48,939
- And you brought him to our suite?
- I had to, Brendan.

430
00:46:49,148 --> 00:46:52,648
Her security people may be involved.

431
00:46:52,856 --> 00:46:56,689
- Is there a problem, Brendan?
- You could say that.

432
00:46:56,898 --> 00:47:01,981
- He says he's been hired to kill Eleanor.
- Not hired, blackmailed.

433
00:47:02,189 --> 00:47:06,481
- Who is this "they"?
- I don't know. We've got to hurry.

434
00:47:06,731 --> 00:47:10,231
They've kidnapped my little girl,
your wife's in serious danger...

435
00:47:10,439 --> 00:47:12,231
Just a minute.

436
00:47:12,439 --> 00:47:18,064
On the strength of this story,
you bring this man to Mr Grans suite?

437
00:47:18,273 --> 00:47:20,773
You think that shows
very good judgement?

438
00:47:21,023 --> 00:47:23,731
I may be just a friend of Brendan, but...

439
00:47:23,981 --> 00:47:26,564
- He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
- What?

440
00:47:26,773 --> 00:47:29,356
He got onto the pool deck with a gun.

441
00:47:29,564 --> 00:47:32,814
How did he get past
security with this gun?

442
00:47:33,023 --> 00:47:36,106
- I'd like to know that.
- Is it real?

443
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:39,689
- Do we know anything about it?
- It looks real.

444
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,898
- May I see it?
- The gun is real.

445
00:47:43,023 --> 00:47:45,689
Well, it certainly looks real.

446
00:47:48,023 --> 00:47:49,648
Whas your opinion?

447
00:47:52,064 --> 00:47:54,814
You're supposed to be the expert.

448
00:48:18,523 --> 00:48:20,564
Yeah, I'd say is real.

449
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:24,898
Are you out of your fucking mind?

450
00:48:25,564 --> 00:48:28,648
- What are you doing?
- Get her out of here.

451
00:48:31,814 --> 00:48:36,106
God, what have you done to me?

452
00:48:38,023 --> 00:48:39,814
You bastard!

453
00:48:43,814 --> 00:48:46,606
You fucked up.
You want me to kill your kid?

454
00:48:46,814 --> 00:48:49,481
You want me to kill you?

455
00:48:52,273 --> 00:48:54,439
Thas enough.

456
00:48:55,648 --> 00:48:57,356
I said thas enough.

457
00:49:12,273 --> 00:49:14,273
Don't let him get away.

458
00:49:35,731 --> 00:49:39,356
- I killed you.
- You fucked up.

459
00:49:40,231 --> 00:49:43,523
No, please.
Please, no.

460
00:50:03,648 --> 00:50:05,064
Help me, Daddy!

461
00:50:06,273 --> 00:50:07,939
Put him down, now!

462
00:50:12,439 --> 00:50:16,273
- You nearly killed him, idiot.
- Nearly doesn't count.

463
00:50:16,523 --> 00:50:20,564
This is a nightmare. It was
supposed to be clean and simple.

464
00:50:20,773 --> 00:50:25,314
A high-powered rifle and is over.
But no, you've got to get creative.

465
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:29,398
Drag some jerk off the street,
stick a gun in his hand...

466
00:50:29,648 --> 00:50:33,939
- What were you thinking?
- Relax, would you? Ls academic now.

467
00:50:34,106 --> 00:50:36,189
Should I have locked her in a closet?

468
00:50:36,398 --> 00:50:40,981
They've been seen all over the hotel
looking like loonies. Got 'em on video.

469
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:45,106
Ill work. Don't worry about it.

470
00:50:45,273 --> 00:50:50,856
Come on, you. Up, les go.
I want to show you something.

471
00:50:53,606 --> 00:50:58,314
- I don't think we should do this.
- Is too late now.

472
00:50:58,523 --> 00:51:01,273
How do I explain
a dead woman on my floor?

473
00:51:01,481 --> 00:51:03,398
She's Eleanor's assistant.

474
00:51:03,606 --> 00:51:06,773
She'll have been shot by
the same gun, the same man,

475
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:10,481
some anonymous loser
who went over the edge.

476
00:51:12,648 --> 00:51:14,606
OK. Look at that.

477
00:51:14,814 --> 00:51:19,648
Thas what it looks like. She was alive
a minute ago, now she's dead because...

478
00:51:19,856 --> 00:51:21,898
...you wouldn't do as I told you.

479
00:51:22,106 --> 00:51:24,606
Clean up. Come on,
we've only a few minutes.

480
00:51:24,856 --> 00:51:28,481
Look at that. Les go.

481
00:51:28,689 --> 00:51:35,439
Every single promise made to us when
we got that woman elected was broken.

482
00:51:35,648 --> 00:51:40,189
I don't have to remind you who was
supposed to keep her in line.

483
00:51:42,273 --> 00:51:47,398
Hey, Albert.
Let me use your phone for a second.

484
00:51:47,606 --> 00:51:50,898
- I know how this is supposed to work.
- Do you?

485
00:51:51,106 --> 00:51:53,648
- I kill her, you kill me.
- Quiet.

486
00:51:53,856 --> 00:51:56,648
If you don't, security will.
How do I escape?

487
00:51:56,856 --> 00:51:59,564
Thas not my problem.
Come back.

488
00:51:59,731 --> 00:52:03,814
- How do I know you won't kill my kid?
- Come back.

489
00:52:04,023 --> 00:52:07,189
She'll be all right, you do your job.

490
00:52:07,398 --> 00:52:12,273
- I'm supposed to trust you?
- What choice do you have? After you.

491
00:52:13,231 --> 00:52:18,481
Gene, look out there.
You see the van?

492
00:52:18,689 --> 00:52:20,398
- Yeah.
- Come back.

493
00:52:20,606 --> 00:52:22,356
- Yeah.
- Do it.

494
00:52:22,564 --> 00:52:26,356
Daddy!
Help me, Daddy! No!

495
00:52:26,564 --> 00:52:28,689
Son of a bitch!

496
00:52:34,564 --> 00:52:37,273
Security, take the next car. Thank you.

497
00:52:41,398 --> 00:52:44,064
- Do it again.
- Daddy! No!

498
00:52:44,314 --> 00:52:45,939
You've one last chance.

499
00:52:46,148 --> 00:52:51,356
Half an hour, the kiïs dead. L'll kill her
myself, rip her head off in front of you.

500
00:52:51,564 --> 00:52:52,898
Come on.

501
00:52:57,731 --> 00:53:01,398
Daddy, did you hear me scream?
She told me to scream.

502
00:53:01,689 --> 00:53:03,773
Did you hear me?

503
00:53:19,898 --> 00:53:21,439
Oh, Jesus!

504
00:53:27,231 --> 00:53:29,981
Next time,
you damn well do it.

505
00:53:30,231 --> 00:53:35,439
You want to babysit a screaming kid
in traffic, you do it. He got the message.

506
00:53:39,023 --> 00:53:42,648
Come on, step up. Give 'em
a shine with that extra something.

507
00:53:42,856 --> 00:53:44,981
Do your shoes a favour.

508
00:53:45,814 --> 00:53:49,731
What you need is a shoeshine.
Shoeshine, shoeshine today.

509
00:53:49,939 --> 00:53:56,523
Hey, take ten, take a break, take
a load off, put the world in perspective.

510
00:53:57,856 --> 00:54:00,814
So what do you do, if I may be so...

511
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:06,856
- You got a complaint?
- Remember me?

512
00:54:07,106 --> 00:54:08,856
Yeah, the big tipper.

513
00:54:09,106 --> 00:54:10,814
Good.

514
00:54:11,064 --> 00:54:15,939
Listen, something's going to happen.
When is over, you'll know what I meant.

515
00:54:16,189 --> 00:54:20,064
What? The end of the world?
Don't give me your crazy rap.

516
00:54:20,314 --> 00:54:25,648
I'm not a bartender. I don't want
to hear it. I raise a family doing this shit.

517
00:54:25,856 --> 00:54:30,398
Get out. Big tip doesn't
give you the right to crap in my ear.

518
00:54:30,606 --> 00:54:33,564
You want change?
Did you give me a $20?

519
00:54:34,398 --> 00:54:35,773
Les get some privacy.

520
00:54:38,773 --> 00:54:40,148
He's deaf.

521
00:54:46,481 --> 00:54:50,689
- You wouldn't be kidding me?
- No. Read that sign.

522
00:54:54,648 --> 00:55:00,273
Is that right? Shine man,
you can't hear me?

523
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:01,773
Hello.

524
00:55:02,439 --> 00:55:07,773
Well, lookee here. My customer
quotient just got multiplied by two.

525
00:55:07,939 --> 00:55:11,564
What about that?
Forgive me. I didn't hear you approach.

526
00:55:11,773 --> 00:55:14,439
Fact is, I'm deaf as a post.

527
00:55:14,648 --> 00:55:17,981
You want a shine?
You don't see your face, you don't pay.

528
00:55:20,439 --> 00:55:22,523
Sure, give me a shine.

529
00:55:22,731 --> 00:55:27,231
Les get out our itinerary.
Hold that. Don't throw it away.

530
00:55:31,273 --> 00:55:34,189
I'm putting your toy back in your pocket.

531
00:55:34,398 --> 00:55:38,231
Is all wound up.
Now, les check that itinerary.

532
00:55:41,106 --> 00:55:44,064
- Right there.
- 1.30, California Ballroom.

533
00:55:45,981 --> 00:55:51,231
That gives you 28 minutes
to get your shit together.

534
00:55:51,439 --> 00:55:53,856
Let me talk to her again.

535
00:55:54,106 --> 00:55:56,439
Forget it.

536
00:55:56,648 --> 00:56:01,231
- Let me talk to her, or you can forget it.
- Don't threaten me.

537
00:56:02,314 --> 00:56:06,564
Id be a lot less trouble
if you just let me talk to her.

538
00:56:08,814 --> 00:56:13,689
- You're wasting time.
- Come back.

539
00:56:13,898 --> 00:56:15,606
- Yeah.
- Put her on.

540
00:56:15,814 --> 00:56:17,689
- What gives?
- Put her on.

541
00:56:21,064 --> 00:56:23,523
Daddy?

542
00:56:23,773 --> 00:56:27,398
- Yeah, honey.
- I'm tired. I want to go now.

543
00:56:28,356 --> 00:56:32,439
- I know. So do I.
- Can we go now?

544
00:56:34,898 --> 00:56:38,189
Not yet, baby.
Daddy has to do something first.

545
00:56:38,398 --> 00:56:42,773
- To be a hero?
- No, not to be a hero.

546
00:56:42,981 --> 00:56:46,773
- I want you to remember something.
- All right.

547
00:56:46,981 --> 00:56:54,564
I'm doing it for you, no matter what
anybody tells you, because I love you.

548
00:56:54,773 --> 00:56:56,814
- All right.
- Promise me?

549
00:56:57,023 --> 00:57:01,856
- I promise.
- All right, kisses to you.

550
00:57:02,439 --> 00:57:04,189
No. Kisses to you.

551
00:57:06,398 --> 00:57:07,773
Kisses to you.

552
00:57:10,606 --> 00:57:12,231
You done yet?

553
00:57:13,356 --> 00:57:17,648
- Two dollars, if it pleases you.
- It does not.

554
00:57:17,898 --> 00:57:21,106
I remember when it was two bits.

555
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:26,023
- 27 minutes.
- Thanks for the tip.

556
00:57:26,231 --> 00:57:29,231
Mister, what are you dragging me into?

557
00:57:29,439 --> 00:57:30,731
- I'm...
- Cover your mouth.

558
00:57:30,981 --> 00:57:34,356
- What?
- That screwball is watching, right?

559
00:57:36,273 --> 00:57:40,189
- Yeah.
- Don't let him see you talking to me.

560
00:57:40,398 --> 00:57:43,314
- That your kid on the walkie-talkie?
- Yeah.

561
00:57:43,523 --> 00:57:47,023
They said they'll kill her
if I don't do something for them.

562
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:50,898
- 27 minutes in the California Ballroom?
- Thas right.

563
00:57:54,314 --> 00:58:00,106
- What are you supposed to do?
- Kill the governor.

564
00:58:01,106 --> 00:58:05,773
I knew I shoulïve gone home
as soon as I got that $20.

565
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:09,606
- What am I supposed to do?
- What am I supposed to do?

566
00:58:09,856 --> 00:58:13,106
They have my baby.
One wrong move, she's dead.

567
00:58:13,314 --> 00:58:18,981
I don't know who to trust.
Everybody's involved in this, except...

568
00:58:19,189 --> 00:58:21,564
- Who?
- The governor.

569
00:58:21,773 --> 00:58:23,731
Oh, Jesus Christ!

570
00:58:24,981 --> 00:58:30,398
I gotta do right by my little girl. I don't
care about myself, as long as she's OK.

571
00:58:33,064 --> 00:58:37,898
Look, I can't keep playing
with these shoes. Ill look funny.

572
00:58:38,731 --> 00:58:44,064
Go and get yourself a drink.
Make sure Godzilla there follows you.

573
00:58:44,273 --> 00:58:50,023
- What are you going to do?
- I've no idea. Go. L'll get word to you.

574
00:58:50,231 --> 00:58:55,523
- Stay out of it. Keep the change.
- Yeah, don't think I won't.

575
00:58:59,564 --> 00:59:01,981
I'm going to get a drink.

576
00:59:07,939 --> 00:59:10,648
- Jack and Coke, please.
- Jack and Coke.

577
00:59:10,856 --> 00:59:14,106
I thought she
was going to get out the violins.

578
00:59:14,314 --> 00:59:18,356
I hear that "stop the violence" routine
again, I'm going to shoot somebody.

579
00:59:18,523 --> 00:59:20,981
Politicians. All the same.

580
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:28,731
God can't help her, Mr Watson.

581
00:59:30,898 --> 00:59:35,189
Say it with me.
At 1.30 my little girl is dead.

582
00:59:35,398 --> 00:59:38,564
...gravy out of your little girl.

583
00:59:38,773 --> 00:59:42,898
...the guy who's gonna kill your
daughter if you don't get moving.

584
00:59:46,523 --> 00:59:50,439
- Sir, here's your Jack and Coke.
- Thank you.

585
00:59:52,648 --> 00:59:55,648
...bullshit because
there is no such animal.

586
00:59:55,898 --> 01:00:01,356
We are a nation of 240 million
special interest groups and thas it.

587
01:00:03,148 --> 01:00:04,814
You haven't paid for that.

588
01:00:05,064 --> 01:00:08,231
Is on that special interest
at the end of the bar.

589
01:00:11,106 --> 01:00:14,564
Sir, sir.
Don't make me call a cop.

590
01:00:25,398 --> 01:00:27,564
Where is he?

591
01:00:27,773 --> 01:00:31,648
- Did you lose him?
- Shut up.

592
01:00:39,106 --> 01:00:40,439
Les hope so.

593
01:00:51,023 --> 01:00:55,356
Quick. Off with the shoes and pants.
Trade with Gustino. Do as I say.

594
01:00:55,564 --> 01:00:58,939
- What you talking about?
- Don't worry.

595
01:00:59,189 --> 01:01:04,398
No time to be shy, ladies.
Do as I tell you.

596
01:01:07,314 --> 01:01:09,231
Hurry up! Godzilla's coming.

597
01:01:16,356 --> 01:01:17,689
Hurry up.

598
01:01:21,939 --> 01:01:23,273
OK.

599
01:01:26,564 --> 01:01:28,981
Come on, shut the door.

600
01:02:07,189 --> 01:02:08,523
He's gone.

601
01:02:33,481 --> 01:02:35,314
- This is lrene.
- Hello.

602
01:02:35,523 --> 01:02:37,106
Irene's going to help.

603
01:02:37,314 --> 01:02:39,773
- Follow me.
- Where am I going?

604
01:02:39,981 --> 01:02:43,439
You said only one person
you knew wasn't in this.

605
01:02:43,648 --> 01:02:46,814
- You're going to see her.
- What?

606
01:02:47,064 --> 01:02:51,273
- You sure she's asleep?
- She take a nap before her big speech.

607
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:53,273
- What should I say?
- Ill come.

608
01:02:53,523 --> 01:02:57,689
Try to stop this before it starts. Save us
all considerable embarrassment.

609
01:02:57,898 --> 01:03:03,273
You don't have to save me. I've nothing
to do with it. I'm not giving you no key.

610
01:03:03,481 --> 01:03:08,231
- I'm not going to do it.
- Come on, lrene.

611
01:03:08,439 --> 01:03:12,106
- Hi, Albert. How you doing?
- Hi, how are you?

612
01:03:15,606 --> 01:03:21,356
Thought I'd come by
and clean up a little for you. Thank you.

613
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:25,523
- You deserve a nice, clean place.
- Thank you.

614
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:32,523
Give me that. Thank you.
How's everything? Working hard?

615
01:03:32,731 --> 01:03:35,773
- Working hard.
- Yes, I know how it is.

616
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:42,606
- How long you going to work here?
- About 5.

617
01:03:42,814 --> 01:03:45,564
- Really? See you later.
- Take care.

618
01:04:38,356 --> 01:04:40,189
I don't want to hurt you.

619
01:04:40,356 --> 01:04:45,314
My security people are right outside.
You wouldn't get very far.

620
01:04:45,523 --> 01:04:48,064
If I wanted to hurt you,
I would have.

621
01:04:48,273 --> 01:04:51,106
- Thas some comfort.
- I have a problem.

622
01:04:51,314 --> 01:04:54,314
- I see that.
- Is also your problem.

623
01:04:56,273 --> 01:04:59,773
- I know you from the elevator.
- Thas right.

624
01:05:00,023 --> 01:05:03,148
- You were very nervous.
- Guns make me nervous.

625
01:05:03,398 --> 01:05:06,648
- Me, too.
- We don't have much time.

626
01:05:06,814 --> 01:05:08,439
Listen carefully.

627
01:05:08,606 --> 01:05:12,856
Three lives depend on you listening
very carefully. Do you understand?

628
01:05:13,064 --> 01:05:19,731
Yes, I do. And I want to hear you. Just
let me call my assistant, Krista Brooks...

629
01:05:19,939 --> 01:05:22,856
She's dead.

630
01:05:25,689 --> 01:05:32,439
- She's dead? How do you know that?
- I saw her die.

631
01:05:36,064 --> 01:05:39,106
- Did you kill her?
- No.

632
01:05:39,314 --> 01:05:41,273
Who did?

633
01:05:41,439 --> 01:05:46,356
A very dangerous man
that works for your husband.

634
01:05:47,814 --> 01:05:53,064
Your husband works for someone else,
and they want you killed.

635
01:06:14,898 --> 01:06:17,606
I said I'd listen. I didn't say I'd believe.

636
01:06:17,814 --> 01:06:21,606
You're telling me
my people are plotting against me,

637
01:06:21,814 --> 01:06:24,981
my husband wants to kill me,
what do you expect?

638
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:30,398
I know. I don't blame you. I have
no proof. But there's one way to find out.

639
01:06:30,606 --> 01:06:34,356
- Try to cancel the last speech.
- Don't call it that.

640
01:06:34,564 --> 01:06:39,564
Is the last chance I have to kill you.
Try to get out of it. They won't let you.

641
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:43,856
Try to change the schedule.
You'll know I'm right.

642
01:06:46,564 --> 01:06:49,273
Don't make that speech. Trust me.

643
01:06:49,481 --> 01:06:52,148
I love it when pistoleros talk about trust.

644
01:06:52,356 --> 01:06:57,064
I've never fired one of these,
but I will if I have to.

645
01:06:58,189 --> 01:07:00,481
Indeed.

646
01:07:05,148 --> 01:07:07,648
9 minutes, Governor.

647
01:07:08,398 --> 01:07:10,648
Franco!

648
01:07:11,523 --> 01:07:12,898
Franco!

649
01:07:19,106 --> 01:07:23,648
What is it, Governor?
Whas wrong?

650
01:07:25,023 --> 01:07:27,231
I...

651
01:07:29,564 --> 01:07:34,898
I had a really bad dream.
I had a really bad dream.

652
01:07:41,773 --> 01:07:43,398
- Well?
- I don't know.

653
01:07:43,606 --> 01:07:45,981
- What are you gonna do?
- I gotta get back.

654
01:07:46,231 --> 01:07:49,398
But what are you gonna do?

655
01:07:53,981 --> 01:07:57,106
I'm going to do whatever I have to.

656
01:08:04,023 --> 01:08:08,856
- Oh, man, we gotta go.
- Come on, hurry, come on.

657
01:08:10,814 --> 01:08:12,814
- Where is he?
- Toilet.

658
01:08:13,023 --> 01:08:19,148
- Is time. Is time now.
- Relax, I got it under control.

659
01:08:33,231 --> 01:08:37,314
- Where are we going?
- Not very far, honey-pie.

660
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:46,648
Outta there.
Mr Watson, time's up. Les go.

661
01:08:49,981 --> 01:08:51,314
Outta there!

662
01:08:55,939 --> 01:08:58,023
- Now you forgot...
- What?

663
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:01,439
Wash your hands.

664
01:09:08,314 --> 01:09:13,231
- Why you doing this to me?
- I saw you with your kid.

665
01:09:14,481 --> 01:09:17,523
I know you'd do anything for her.

666
01:09:26,481 --> 01:09:32,981
I got faith in you. You're not
just a regular guy. I know that.

667
01:09:34,606 --> 01:09:36,398
You don't know it yourself.

668
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:47,189
Maybe thas why.
Come here.

669
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,856
I chose you.

670
01:09:57,564 --> 01:10:00,939
I know what I have to do.
L'll do it. Les do it.

671
01:10:23,106 --> 01:10:26,856
- Eleanor, we'd better head downstairs.
- Good afternoon, Eleanor.

672
01:10:29,898 --> 01:10:34,689
I've got a killer headache,
and siesta hair,

673
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:37,189
I'm thinking
of cancelling the speech.

674
01:10:39,064 --> 01:10:44,148
- Well, is an important speech.
- I'd say critical.

675
01:10:44,356 --> 01:10:46,356
Course, is no business of mine.

676
01:10:46,564 --> 01:10:51,939
Just another speech in a Tower of Babel
so high, even Nimrod would be shamed.

677
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:55,481
Cancel and make my apologies.

678
01:10:56,689 --> 01:10:59,189
- Won't you excuse us?
- Yes.

679
01:10:59,398 --> 01:11:01,773
Nice to see you, Eleanor.

680
01:11:10,273 --> 01:11:12,981
During a campaign,
every speech is important.

681
01:11:13,189 --> 01:11:16,106
This is free, prime-time coverage.
We couldn't buy it.

682
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:18,856
- Why's he here?
- Who, him?

683
01:11:19,064 --> 01:11:23,439
- Yes, him.
- I asked him here. I needed his input.

684
01:11:23,648 --> 01:11:26,398
Things have changed.
I thought you understood.

685
01:11:26,648 --> 01:11:29,523
Eleanor, don't start.
I understand things have changed.

686
01:11:29,773 --> 01:11:35,356
I'm dealing with the repercussions,
taking the heat for your broken promises

687
01:11:35,564 --> 01:11:38,523
to people like him
who helped get you elected.

688
01:11:38,731 --> 01:11:41,106
Don't remind me.

689
01:11:45,481 --> 01:11:48,731
Listen to me.

690
01:11:48,939 --> 01:11:54,856
This speech or a half-dozen rubber
chicken fundraisers. What do you say?

691
01:11:56,814 --> 01:11:59,648
The truth...

692
01:11:59,856 --> 01:12:05,481
The truth is I've got this lower intestinal
habit, Brendan. I feel sick.

693
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:09,064
I want to cancel the speech.

694
01:12:15,398 --> 01:12:17,648
This isn't like you.

695
01:12:21,148 --> 01:12:23,106
You're a trouper.

696
01:12:24,939 --> 01:12:27,356
Right, I'm going to get some Pepto.

697
01:12:27,564 --> 01:12:31,023
Go make one of your patented
tributes to the common person,

698
01:12:32,398 --> 01:12:35,064
and we're back to Sacramento.

699
01:12:35,273 --> 01:12:38,898
We can't lay down on the job now,
whatever the polls say.

700
01:12:39,148 --> 01:12:42,856
You want to blow off
the Sacramento speech, thas fine.

701
01:12:43,106 --> 01:12:46,523
But do this one,
and les get out of the smog.

702
01:12:51,064 --> 01:12:53,106
OK.

703
01:12:54,939 --> 01:12:56,231
L'll do it.

704
01:13:00,689 --> 01:13:02,481
Thas my girl.

705
01:13:14,731 --> 01:13:17,898
I want to make
some changes in that speech.

706
01:13:18,106 --> 01:13:20,564
Would you send Krista in right away?

707
01:13:20,773 --> 01:13:24,606
Oh, jeez, I sent her on an errand.

708
01:13:30,064 --> 01:13:32,689
You sent my assistant on an errand?

709
01:13:33,856 --> 01:13:35,731
Yeah.

710
01:13:49,981 --> 01:13:51,731
Why do you keep looking at me?

711
01:13:51,939 --> 01:13:55,189
- Is my job. I'm your babysitter.
- I'm not a baby.

712
01:13:55,398 --> 01:13:59,481
- You're a big girl?
- No, but I'm not a baby.

713
01:14:34,939 --> 01:14:38,231
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the press,

714
01:14:38,481 --> 01:14:40,231
campaign volunteers,

715
01:14:40,481 --> 01:14:44,814
and those of you who were looking for
any excuse to take off from work...

716
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:52,023
Let me be the first to welcome you
to this afternoon's campaign banquet.

717
01:15:17,564 --> 01:15:21,773
Governor Eleanor Samara Grant.

718
01:15:39,648 --> 01:15:47,189
What can I say about her that won't get
me in trouble when I go home tonight?

719
01:15:49,148 --> 01:15:54,606
Seriously, she is a woman
who loves our great state.

720
01:16:05,481 --> 01:16:11,564
I know you recognise her as
a charitable and enlightened leader.

721
01:16:11,731 --> 01:16:16,981
She actually united Republicans
and Democrats in the assembly

722
01:16:17,189 --> 01:16:23,606
to pass new laws
to improve the lives of all Californians.

723
01:16:23,814 --> 01:16:27,231
Charlie. Yo, Charlie.

724
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:30,273
Charlie,
are you reading me? Charlie?

725
01:16:31,564 --> 01:16:33,606
Charlie, are you reading me?

726
01:16:33,856 --> 01:16:35,856
Cha... Shit, stupid radio.

727
01:16:36,648 --> 01:16:42,648
Terry, the walkie-talkies don't work
from here, too much concrete and stuff.

728
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:45,273
...California has ever seen!

729
01:16:53,523 --> 01:16:56,939
I am honoured to present to you

730
01:16:57,189 --> 01:17:00,898
our esteemed governor
and my beloved wife,

731
01:17:01,689 --> 01:17:04,981
Eleanor Samara Grant.

732
01:18:49,564 --> 01:18:53,356
Gun!
Get down, Governor!

733
01:18:57,481 --> 01:18:59,773
Get a doctor!
The governor's been shot!

734
01:19:52,148 --> 01:19:53,773
They did it.

735
01:19:57,856 --> 01:20:00,939
A bleeding heart makes
a very big target, Governor.

736
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:15,939
My God!

737
01:20:24,773 --> 01:20:29,106
Franco! Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

738
01:20:29,356 --> 01:20:34,856
It would be better if they put sleeves on
these damn bullet-proof vests.

739
01:20:46,148 --> 01:20:50,898
Is time. Do you read me?

740
01:20:51,523 --> 01:20:55,398
I don't hear you.
I'm going to go ahead now.

741
01:21:19,523 --> 01:21:22,064
Hey!
Hey!

742
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:45,731
Fuck with me, huh?

743
01:21:55,398 --> 01:21:57,356
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

744
01:21:57,564 --> 01:22:00,148
- I have something for you.
- A surprise?

745
01:22:00,356 --> 01:22:04,273
You ask too many questions.
You want the surprise or not?

746
01:22:04,481 --> 01:22:06,314
Close your eyes.

747
01:22:12,273 --> 01:22:14,481
Afternoon, ma'am.
Hello, little girl.

748
01:22:14,689 --> 01:22:18,731
- What are you doing?
- Giving you a clean windshield.

749
01:22:18,939 --> 01:22:23,689
- I don't want my windshield cleaned.
- You just think you don't.

750
01:22:23,898 --> 01:22:26,689
I know I don't want it cleaned.
Get outta here.

751
01:22:26,898 --> 01:22:29,064
Don't be like that.

752
01:22:29,231 --> 01:22:34,731
I'm the Moses of dirty windshields leading
you through the desert of dead bugs.

753
01:22:35,023 --> 01:22:39,273
This is the last time.
Get outta here.

754
01:22:39,481 --> 01:22:42,314
I've already done it.
You have to pay me now.

755
01:22:42,523 --> 01:22:44,273
I ain't paying nothing.

756
01:22:44,481 --> 01:22:49,689
You'll deny me a lousy dollar,
after I've given you a clean windshield?

757
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:52,856
- Fucking A!
- I don't think so!

758
01:22:53,064 --> 01:22:56,773
- I think this is worth a dollar.
- Give it to me.

759
01:22:57,023 --> 01:23:00,023
L'll do better than that.
You ungrateful honky, I'm gonna...

760
01:23:04,523 --> 01:23:06,356
...whip your ass!

761
01:23:17,356 --> 01:23:21,189
- Give it to me!
- Get off me!

762
01:23:24,814 --> 01:23:27,314
Daddy blew it.

763
01:23:33,689 --> 01:23:34,981
No!

764
01:23:49,106 --> 01:23:55,564
Very good, Mr Watson,
I told them I could make a killer of you.

765
01:24:07,356 --> 01:24:09,314
Daddy!

766
01:24:16,689 --> 01:24:19,731
You OK, honey?

767
01:24:31,398 --> 01:24:33,481
Nothing like a good wing-tip.

768
01:24:34,231 --> 01:24:38,898
You OK? You OK?
You OK? You OK?

769
01:24:39,106 --> 01:24:43,148
- I'm OK.
- Baby.

770
01:24:43,398 --> 01:24:45,773
I'm standing in the Bonaventure lobby.

771
01:24:45,939 --> 01:24:50,356
Just minutes ago, shots were fired at
Governor Grant. Police are just arriving.

772
01:24:50,606 --> 01:24:54,106
Details of the assassination
attempt continue to pour in.

773
01:24:54,314 --> 01:24:57,314
This will be one of the most
bizarre stories of the year.

774
01:24:57,523 --> 01:25:01,273
Our sources are pinpointing
a conspiracy which could point

775
01:25:01,481 --> 01:25:04,731
as high as Brendan Grant,
Governor Grans husband.

776
01:25:04,981 --> 01:25:10,314
This is a bizarre case, and we'll give
you any details as we get them.

777
01:25:10,523 --> 01:25:12,148
