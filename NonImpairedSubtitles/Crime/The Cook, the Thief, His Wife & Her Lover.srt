1
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:13,884
Go and get the dogs.

2
00:02:18,196 --> 00:02:20,494
Come on, then. Mews!

3
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:30,438
Come on, now. Open your mouth.
Open your mouth, eh?

4
00:02:30,475 --> 00:02:33,171
Learn to appreciate your food, eh?

5
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:38,949
Compared to what you serve up
in that dirty little canteen of yours,

6
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:42,519
this is a three-star supper.

7
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:46,682
You must learn the rules.

8
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:50,591
I need to eat and drink the very best
and that's expensive.

9
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:53,390
Have you ever heard of
chicken à la reine Marie

10
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:55,759
or oyster sauce mornay

11
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:58,233
or frogs' legs Parisienne?

12
00:02:58,369 --> 00:03:00,462
No. Course you haven't.

13
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:03,597
Take his pants down! Take his pants down.

14
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:14,645
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

15
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:20,423
Albert! Leave him alone.

16
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,256
- Come on, let's eat.
- Oh, let's eat.

17
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:28,225
Before we eat, Georgina,
we must feed and water the animals.

18
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,795
Roy! This is my wife, Georgina Spica.

19
00:03:32,937 --> 00:03:35,303
She's got a heart of gold and a body to match.

20
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,004
I am Albert Spica and I have a heart of gold
and a great deal of money to match.

21
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:45,716
And you are Roy, who's got absolutely nothing,
except what you owe me.

22
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:51,550
You are humiliated in front of a lady,
you're humiliated in front of us.

23
00:03:51,723 --> 00:03:55,591
Georgina, I'll be as quick as I possibly can.

24
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,154
Gah... You, go and get me some hot water, eh?
And a towel and soap.

25
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:02,626
Now...

26
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:05,294
Yeah.

27
00:04:05,436 --> 00:04:09,202
Now I've given you a good dinner
and you can have a nice drink.

28
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,639
Now, you behave yourself in future
and pay when I ask you.

29
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:15,838
- No, no, no...
- Or next time I'll make you eat your own shit

30
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:19,075
after forcing it through your dick like toothpaste.

31
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:24,086
No, put that away, Spangler.
Cor blimey, there's a lady present.

32
00:04:24,255 --> 00:04:27,986
She doesn't want to see
your shriveled contributions.

33
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:29,990
Ah.

34
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:33,324
That's it. Thank you very much. Nice, clean...

35
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:35,831
Give me that towel!

36
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,197
Give me that. Yeah.

37
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:43,740
I never liked that Chinese food
but looking at you now, I like it even less.

38
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,469
Righto, boys!

39
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:49,807
We must surprise Richard on our anniversary.

40
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,939
Bring the letters.

41
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,680
Georgie, you got ash on your tits.
If you're gonna wear black, don't smoke.

42
00:04:57,855 --> 00:05:01,291
- You look like a tart in black.
- It's blue.

43
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:05,021
It's black, and don't smoke. It's sloppy in a woman.

44
00:05:05,196 --> 00:05:07,460
No one who's going to eat smokes.

45
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:11,661
It ruins your taste buds, burns your tongue
and makes your pee stink.

46
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,135
- Rubbish.
- It's not bloody rubbish.

47
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,571
I've smelt the loo
after you've been piddling in there.

48
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,609
When are you gonna learn, smartarse?

49
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:30,412
# Have mercy upon me #

50
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:34,252
Come on, hurry up, boys.

51
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,724
#... upon me #

52
00:05:39,363 --> 00:05:44,164
Righto, lads, get them numbers up there -
Spica & Boarst.

53
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:54,268
# Blot out my transgressions

54
00:05:55,847 --> 00:06:02,446
# Purge me with hyssop

55
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:09,183
# And I shall be clean

56
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:14,255
# Wash me

57
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:18,265
# Wash me

58
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:24,968
# And I shall be whiter than snow #

59
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:29,436
Where's Richard?

60
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:32,914
- He's plucking.
- He's plucking, eh? Richard!

61
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,883
Where are you?
Stop that plucking. Where are you?

62
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,650
Now what's that? A-S-P...

63
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:43,384
That's nonsense. Spell it right, for Christ's sake.

64
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:47,122
Bloody hell. Richard! Rich... Ah!

65
00:06:47,431 --> 00:06:50,059
There you are, Richard. Now...

66
00:06:50,234 --> 00:06:53,431
Leave that out and come and see
what I've got you, eh?

67
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:57,065
I've brought you a present.
This is our anniversary.

68
00:06:57,241 --> 00:07:00,768
Three months of mutual understanding,
eh, Richard?

69
00:07:00,945 --> 00:07:06,383
Three months since I first invited you
to be my favorite restaurateur.

70
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,009
Mr. Spica, this is a duck.

71
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:12,588
Ducks are born with the feathers on

72
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,248
but it's your dinner, Mr. Spica.

73
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:20,626
If you want the feathers to remain,
we could try the dish,

74
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:24,758
I suppose, by leaving the feathers as they are.

75
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:27,030
Canard en ses plumes torche.

76
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:31,003
Mitchel, you mule.

77
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:33,544
'Ere, Richard, come and see, come on.

78
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:36,707
Please, I beg you. Ha! Come on.

79
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:43,349
Georgina, how many times have I told you?
No smoking in the kitchen.

80
00:07:43,454 --> 00:07:48,255
Mitchel, get your arse down here quick. Come on.

81
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:53,796
Now, Richard, this is your... well, our new sign.

82
00:07:53,965 --> 00:07:56,198
# Da-da-da-da-da-da! #

83
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:58,793
Wallop!

84
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:07,504
Oh, God!

85
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,904
Richard.

86
00:08:12,216 --> 00:08:15,447
- It's dark in the restaurant.
- Yes, Phillipe.

87
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:19,956
Thanks to Mr. Spica's generosity,
it is dark everywhere.

88
00:08:22,493 --> 00:08:24,893
No power, no light.

89
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:32,530
- Were you thinking of a cold buffet tonight?
- But I don't want a cold buffet.

90
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:38,542
- Pâté d'alouettes with a chicory sauce.
- Pâté d'alouettes with a chicory sauce.

91
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:43,544
- Terrine de caneton.
- Terrine de canton.

92
00:08:43,714 --> 00:08:49,550
- Cold turkey with lemon and basilica.
- Cold turkey with the lemon and basilica.

93
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,711
Anchovies in garlic vinegar.

94
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:55,815
It doesn't have to be cold,
you've got gas, for God's sake!

95
00:08:58,396 --> 00:09:02,059
Got an arse on her
like two greased watermelons in a sack.

96
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:05,430
Cold chicken, pâté d'alouettes,

97
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:09,199
salade de langoustine,
gâteau de carottes et Gruyére...

98
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:14,436
You. You put them electrics right, Mitchel.
Put them electrics right or...

99
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:16,570
You don't eat.

100
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,706
You don't eat.

101
00:09:21,619 --> 00:09:24,213
I told you not to smoke.

102
00:09:25,756 --> 00:09:28,850
I should stand still, Mr. Spica. Or who knows?

103
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,395
You might spoil something,
put your foot in something.

104
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,299
So, a hot meal for tonight.
Something special, please. How about some...

105
00:09:37,601 --> 00:09:41,765
some, er, les oh d'oeuvres, er, gâteau au poivres,

106
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:46,900
er, terrine et fillet lamb et poison au er, poi, poi...

107
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:50,503
- It's "poisson".
- What did you say, Georgie?

108
00:09:50,648 --> 00:09:52,946
What did you say? What did you say?

109
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:56,076
Poisson.

110
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:06,561
- Well, Mr. Spica, I hope you are hungry.
- Always. Get in there, boys.

111
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:15,562
Go on, Georgie, go in there,
raise your skirts and warm my seat.

112
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,542
Eh, what do you think then, eh? What do you...?

113
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:32,082
If you spent as much money
on the meal, Mr. Spica,

114
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:35,087
as you waste on the decor,

115
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:39,855
your taste in good food must surely improve.

116
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,094
You'll cheek me once too often, Boarst.
You rely on me, don't forget.

117
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:51,402
Without me, you, a foreigner,
you wouldn't last long around here.

118
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:53,943
Look out there, see what I've brought you.

119
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,775
Two vans full of good stuff,
just right for your kitchen.

120
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,281
I would not touch it.
Why on earth not?

121
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:05,718
I insist on buying my own food, Mr. Spica.

122
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:08,951
Then I can be sure of its quality.

123
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:12,654
I represent quality round here,
my name is known for it.

124
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,392
I offer quality and protection.

125
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:21,096
Protection against what,
I wonder, Mr. Spica? And whom?

126
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:25,800
Protection, Boarst,
against the rash temper of my men.

127
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:30,774
Against a sudden arrival of food poisoning.

128
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:36,079
Against rats. Against the public health inspector.

129
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:40,681
If you are hungry tonight,
you are going to have to wait.

130
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,693
Do up the third button
of your expensive jacket, Mr. Spica.

131
00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:51,893
You'll feel less empty inside, Mr. Spica.

132
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,300
You can't make me wait.

133
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:58,772
# Deliver me

134
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:06,475
# From blood-guiltiness

135
00:12:07,952 --> 00:12:11,251
# O God

136
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:16,657
# My tongue shall sing aloud

137
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,854
# Of Thy righteousness

138
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:28,170
# Have mercy upon me

139
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:37,243
# Blot out my transgressions

140
00:12:38,682 --> 00:12:48,956
# O Lord, open Thou my lips

141
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,463
# And my mouth

142
00:12:54,665 --> 00:13:03,232
# Shall show forth Thy praise

143
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,071
# And my mouth

144
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:15,379
# Shall show forth Thy praise

145
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:18,978
# And my mouth

146
00:13:19,123 --> 00:13:27,394
# Shall show forth Thy praise

147
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,692
# And my mouth

148
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:38,900
# Shall show forth Thy praise #

149
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:11,132
No, you don't eat it like that! Let me show you.

150
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:15,473
Oh. Imagine you are sucking
the little fingers of a lady or...

151
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:21,142
No, you'd never get that close to a lady.
Who'd wanna get that close to you?

152
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:25,585
- I wouldn't be interested in her fingers.
- I'd expect you to say that.

153
00:14:25,723 --> 00:14:29,921
You'd just whip it in, whip it out
and wipe it on yourjacket.

154
00:14:30,027 --> 00:14:32,894
Look at yourjacket, it's like a pig field.

155
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:36,225
And your nails could do with a clean. Show me.

156
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:41,800
Gawd. Why can't I have some bloody quality
in my associates?

157
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:46,508
From now on, anyone not properly dressed
for dinner will pay for it.

158
00:14:46,643 --> 00:14:50,409
I'll write lessons down for you.
Georgina can type them out.

159
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:56,413
"Notes For Gourmets". That's French
for a good eater, isn't it, Boarst?

160
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,685
- Gourmets don't belch.
- On the contrary, on the contrary. They do.

161
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:03,851
It shows that you are enjoying a meal.

162
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:08,057
Not with your fingers, Spangler!
That's all you understand -

163
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:11,657
things you eat with your hands
whilst walking down the street.

164
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:14,896
You told Mews to eat the celery with his fingers.

165
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,305
That's different, you dope.
And it's asparagus, not celery.

166
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:25,406
What's the point of sinking thousands
into a restaurant if you refuse to eat properly?

167
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:29,247
- Tell him, Georgina.
- Tell him what?

168
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:34,084
Just copy Georgina. She knows how to do it.
Cory, get Richard in here.

169
00:15:34,258 --> 00:15:38,854
I want my sign fixed up
and put on that wall over the kitchen door.

170
00:15:38,996 --> 00:15:43,490
If Richard was more interested in slogans,
he'd make more money, eh?

171
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:46,731
This place is too dark.

172
00:15:46,837 --> 00:15:50,603
Could do with a respray. Gold, it needs more gold.

173
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:53,242
How about gold and blue?

174
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:58,477
What do you think, Henry?
10,000 should do it - two months' takings.

175
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:02,348
You should get in there.
Boarst's prices are all over the place.

176
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:07,690
His head's in the clouds. Good cook. Brilliant cook!

177
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:12,457
Except he puts mushrooms on everything.
Henry, put that cigarette out.

178
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:15,892
Do you mind if I eat whilst you smoke?

179
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:20,368
Gordon choked on a cigarette whilst eating -
burnt his epiglottis.

180
00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:24,406
Mitchel, you've got one.
And you don't keep it in your trousers.

181
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:31,480
You don't put orange rind on the edge
of your plate, it goes there, you dolt!

182
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:37,144
What you've got to realize is that
a clever cook puts unlikely things together

183
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,848
like duck and orange, like pineapple and ham.

184
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:42,982
It's called artistry.

185
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:47,359
I'm an artist, the way I combine
my business and my pleasure.

186
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,830
Money's my business, eating's my pleasure.

187
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:54,267
And Georgie's my pleasure too,
though in a more private kind of way

188
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:58,137
than stuffing the mouth and feeding the sewers.

189
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,401
Though the pleasures are related,

190
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:06,108
because the naughty bits and the dirty bits
are so close together

191
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:11,646
that itjust goes to show
how eating and sex are related.

192
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:15,781
Georgie's naughty bits
are nicely related, aren't they?

193
00:17:15,893 --> 00:17:19,021
Especially when she's
paying me attention. Georgie.

194
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:26,235
Get Phillipe! In future, I want my napkins
folded at home, Georgina. Get Adele to teach you.

195
00:17:27,871 --> 00:17:30,237
Spangler, get up and get Phillipe.

196
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:34,276
Bring Richard here,
I've got to make him a proposition.

197
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:38,042
Get Adele to get that water
with the angostura bitters in it

198
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:42,717
and some lemon in the water
and a bowl of ice water for me fingers...

199
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:47,449
Henry! Give me those glasses off that table.
And the flowers.

200
00:17:48,592 --> 00:17:51,593
This should look the most important table here.

201
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:55,029
I like a load of glasses around, it highers the tone.

202
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,507
- What's that?
- For Madame Spica, compliments of the house.

203
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:17,677
She's no Madame. Why haven't I got one?

204
00:18:17,788 --> 00:18:21,849
- I doubt, Mr. Spica, if you'll like it.
- Try me.

205
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:27,257
We have grown accustomed
to you being a conservative eater.

206
00:18:27,364 --> 00:18:30,765
That's not true. I'm as adventurous as the next.

207
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,961
Your wife has an excellent palate, Mr. Spica.

208
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,131
It is always a pleasure for us to serve her.

209
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:27,374
I want one of those hot, damp towels,
Richard, served to me with tongs.

210
00:20:28,485 --> 00:20:33,582
Adele is no good with cash and figures.
She's just decorative, all lips and tits.

211
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,591
- We'll replace her.
- Can I do the replacing?

212
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,665
Stuff your mouth, Mitchel. Every time you open it,
you just show how vulgar you can be.

213
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,869
Georgina! Welcome back.

214
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:23,666
Did you wipe the seat
before you parked your bum?

215
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,810
You never know what you can catch these days.
Every toilet seat is a minefield.

216
00:21:28,845 --> 00:21:35,148
That's for you. Richard thought I might like
to taste it, personal compliments of the chef.

217
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,855
Eat it. I didn't fancy it, it smelt off.

218
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:42,783
Iris got a canker on her bum
from sitting on a loo seat.

219
00:21:42,893 --> 00:21:48,490
The mechanic across the road poured
battery acid down the WC to clear it.

220
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:54,101
Some of it splashed on the seat.
Iris ran screaming into the street,

221
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,296
her backside hissing.

222
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,431
She hasn't been the same since.

223
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:03,605
She strips the same
but never with her back to the audience.

224
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,946
She had to change her act.
Now it's more full-frontal.

225
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:11,214
- Where are you going?
- I left my lighter in the toilet.

226
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:14,051
- Gawd's sake. You don't need it.
- I need it.

227
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:19,255
Richard, I'm going to ban smoking in here.
Tomorrow, the signs are going up.

228
00:22:19,496 --> 00:22:22,829
You want to thicken your French accent
up a bit, mate,

229
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,457
like you've just come over from Paris.

230
00:22:25,602 --> 00:22:30,130
Give them a bit of that ooh-la-la stuff.
Bit more of that "parlez-vous français?"

231
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:33,299
Then you would not understand me, Mr. Spica.

232
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:37,642
I don't know. I've always been able
to understand French letters.

233
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:16,903
Georgina!

234
00:25:17,073 --> 00:25:19,564
What the hell are you doing in here?

235
00:25:20,844 --> 00:25:23,438
Georgina?

236
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:27,811
You've been in here for ages.
What are you doing, having a baby?

237
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:30,215
I'm, er, I'm just...

238
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,981
- I'm just having a quiet smoke.
- Smoke?

239
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:40,485
You know how you hate me smoking at the table.

240
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,132
Gawd's sake, Georgina.

241
00:25:43,266 --> 00:25:46,099
Why tell me lies about a lost lighter?

242
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:51,036
I didn't, I left it here
on the ledge in front of the mirror.

243
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:55,507
I'll be out in a few moments.

244
00:25:55,612 --> 00:26:00,276
Don't hang around the ladies,
you'll embarrass the customers.

245
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,441
Show me the lighter.

246
00:26:02,552 --> 00:26:05,020
There.

247
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,552
Do you want a cigarette as well?

248
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,059
Don't be so bloody stupid.

249
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:16,393
What are you doing in there,
Georgina, eh?

250
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:18,592
You playing with yourself?

251
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:23,298
That's not allowed, that's my property.
You're not allowed to fiddle with it.

252
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:28,675
- Shut up, Albert.
- Let me in, I'll show you how to wipe yourself.

253
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,347
Go away. I'll be out in a minute.

254
00:26:32,482 --> 00:26:35,315
Well, don't be long.

255
00:26:35,485 --> 00:26:39,615
I'll order you some gâteau aux poivres.

256
00:26:40,457 --> 00:26:42,823
Some profiteroles.

257
00:26:46,963 --> 00:26:48,988
And wash your hands.

258
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,092
You don't know the women who use this place.

259
00:28:02,338 --> 00:28:04,431
You took your time.

260
00:28:05,408 --> 00:28:08,002
I thought you'd like me to wait for you.

261
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,008
You smell nice and sweaty.

262
00:28:12,115 --> 00:28:14,640
Wash your hands, I'll give you a kiss.

263
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:34,066
You know what they say about men
who hang around ladies' lavatories?

264
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,524
What do they say about men
who hang around ladies' lavatories?

265
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:45,708
- They're asking to have their illusions shattered.
- Yeah.

266
00:28:45,915 --> 00:28:49,214
You hold no illusions for me, Georgie, eh?

267
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:51,617
No stone's been left unturned.

268
00:28:51,754 --> 00:28:55,212
Look, just go order my profiteroles, will you?

269
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,588
Come on.

270
00:28:59,896 --> 00:29:01,887
Come on.

271
00:29:45,608 --> 00:29:48,941
I think these Ethiopians like starving.

272
00:29:49,112 --> 00:29:55,540
It keeps them slim and graceful, with those
big heads and dreamy eyes. You know those kids.

273
00:29:55,685 --> 00:30:00,179
You're sick.
I might well be if you're being so priggish.

274
00:30:00,323 --> 00:30:06,159
What do you know, Georgina, about
the starving? You can have anything you want.

275
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:11,528
- Where you been? You're late.
- It's Friday night. There's a lot of money about.

276
00:30:13,002 --> 00:30:17,598
A decent man needs gloves to touch this stuff.
Let's have a look.

277
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,675
That's just what this restaurant needs.

278
00:30:20,843 --> 00:30:23,437
Start laying them out.

279
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:27,049
What's the matter, Mitchel?
Don't you like mussels?

280
00:30:27,183 --> 00:30:30,448
You got to learn to like them
if you're going to eat with me.

281
00:30:30,553 --> 00:30:33,078
Don't you dare throw up in here!

282
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:36,680
Or I'll get Spangler to stuff 'em
back down your throat.

283
00:30:36,826 --> 00:30:42,822
From the Malay restaurant.
The food poisoning scared them, they're paying up.

284
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,958
I'm sure they don't need our assistance with that.

285
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:49,402
That stuff they eat,
they'd poison themselves with it.

286
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:53,873
Some of them Indians are well known
for drinking their own pee.

287
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:57,673
The same water would go round and round.

288
00:30:57,847 --> 00:31:02,648
Of course, you're bound to lose some
through evaporation.

289
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:07,119
Then you'd have to top it up.
Whose pee would you drink first?

290
00:31:07,223 --> 00:31:10,420
- Erm...
- Me, I'd have a ready supply, wouldn't I?

291
00:31:10,526 --> 00:31:14,121
Georgie and I have our little sessions when we...

292
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:16,527
Good God, what have you got there?

293
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:21,126
Even you are getting compliments
from the chef, are you?

294
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:24,831
Being a guinea pig
for a Boarst experiment, are we?

295
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:31,470
Good God, looks like, er,
food for constipated French rabbits.

296
00:31:31,614 --> 00:31:36,313
Albert, why don't you order me some chianti?
You know I like chianti.

297
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:39,046
In the bottle with the wrapping around it.

298
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:42,385
Then I can take it home and hang it on the wall.

299
00:31:42,492 --> 00:31:46,553
- Grace, haven't you got enough of them already?
- No.

300
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:48,687
Where the hell are you going?

301
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:52,359
- To the toilet.
- You haven't had anything to drink yet.

302
00:31:56,806 --> 00:31:59,866
- You've upset her.
- Rubbish.

303
00:31:59,976 --> 00:32:06,176
Don't be long! You're so talkative tonight,
we couldn't stand the silence without you.

304
00:32:07,683 --> 00:32:09,548
Wash your hands!

305
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:31,362
- Questo, questo.
- Cazzo.

306
00:32:31,507 --> 00:32:34,271
Dove hai imparato a cucinare? È velenoso.

307
00:32:34,444 --> 00:32:36,674
Vieni qua.

308
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,706
That's off!

309
00:35:18,841 --> 00:35:20,841
Uh.

310
00:35:20,876 --> 00:35:24,710
- This custard's salty.
- It is sauce Hollandaise.

311
00:35:25,014 --> 00:35:27,005
Can I help you, Mr. Spica?

312
00:35:27,116 --> 00:35:30,711
I've come about
those special complimentary dishes.

313
00:35:30,853 --> 00:35:34,448
In future, all the guests at my table
shall receive them.

314
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,081
Why is my fish taking so long?

315
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,525
You can carry it in yourself, if you like, Mr. Spica.

316
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,693
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing. You bring it.

317
00:35:45,835 --> 00:35:50,499
- You would not be looking for your wife?
- No, of course not.

318
00:35:50,673 --> 00:35:53,733
Mr. Spica, I have something to show you.

319
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:11,984
- What is this?
- New cutlery. Give your restaurant some style.

320
00:36:12,094 --> 00:36:16,622
I brought in 300 sets.
My men are just re-laying the tables.

321
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,800
Not very good quality, Mr. Spica.

322
00:36:22,938 --> 00:36:27,341
You could use them at home, Mr. Spica.

323
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,138
All 300 of them.

324
00:37:06,982 --> 00:37:09,542
Where have you been? Wiping your bum?

325
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:13,086
Did you use your left hand like I showed you?

326
00:37:13,222 --> 00:37:16,988
Where'd you get this stuff, Mews?
It's rubbish, falling apart.

327
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,892
Take 'em back. Get a 150% refund. God.

328
00:37:23,466 --> 00:37:28,130
What are you eating, Georgie? Not much.

329
00:37:28,304 --> 00:37:32,968
Ha! I see others here
get the same special attentions.

330
00:37:33,142 --> 00:37:38,273
What is it? Looks like
some sort of... watery salade.

331
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,679
That's not up to much.

332
00:37:40,783 --> 00:37:43,877
Expensive, no doubt, but not fattening.

333
00:37:43,986 --> 00:37:47,353
You've got to keep your strength up,
you're looking peaky.

334
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:50,584
Kidneys, liver, iron, that's what you need.

335
00:37:50,693 --> 00:37:56,825
Do you know a cow drinks
its own weight in water twice a week?

336
00:37:56,932 --> 00:38:01,562
For milk, you see,
because a cow's got great big tits.

337
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,069
Just like you, eh, Georgie?

338
00:38:07,643 --> 00:38:11,636
You gentlemen will have to take it
for granted because

339
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:15,239
for some reason best known to herself,

340
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,511
she's left her bra off.

341
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,557
Have you, Cory, ever tasted human milk?

342
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:27,222
I mean recently. All them years ago don't count.

343
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:32,194
You couldn't really appreciate
what you were enjoying then, could you?

344
00:38:32,368 --> 00:38:38,238
I bet human milk's a great delicacy
in some countries. It ought to be here.

345
00:38:39,241 --> 00:38:42,870
Do you know, Cory, who could supply us
with some human milk?

346
00:38:43,045 --> 00:38:47,311
Warm, straight from the receptacle,
so to speak?

347
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:51,477
Don'tjoke! It's a precious commodity,
not a joking matter!

348
00:38:51,587 --> 00:38:54,249
Georgie wouldn'tjoke about it, would you?

349
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,482
Would you, Georgie?

350
00:38:56,592 --> 00:39:02,053
Ah. You're a credit to women. You could show
these young women a thing or two.

351
00:39:02,198 --> 00:39:05,998
You could teach these young men
a thing or two. Take Mitchel.

352
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:09,831
On second thoughts, don't,
cos he's a crude little bugger.

353
00:39:10,005 --> 00:39:13,668
- Then how come you haven't got any kids?
- Kids?

354
00:39:15,678 --> 00:39:19,205
Who needs kids? Who wants kids?

355
00:39:20,883 --> 00:39:23,147
I want kids.

356
00:39:24,386 --> 00:39:28,413
We'll have kids one day, won't we, eh?

357
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,559
When you're bloody old and gray, most like!

358
00:39:34,697 --> 00:39:38,292
Yeah. Your trouble is you don't eat properly.

359
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:43,465
You should drink more water and eat more kidneys

360
00:39:43,572 --> 00:39:47,565
and then you might bloody well
have a bloody baby someday.

361
00:39:49,144 --> 00:39:51,806
Georgie doesn't like babies, do you?

362
00:39:51,981 --> 00:39:57,180
You know, sometimes, Georgie,
I think you behave like a bloke.

363
00:39:57,286 --> 00:39:59,311
What days are those, then, Albert?

364
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:01,412
- What's it like?
- You what?

365
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:06,188
Get away from this table, you mucky little wimp!

366
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:11,433
Go and eat your vegetable soup in the kitchen,
you dirty little pervert!

367
00:40:11,468 --> 00:40:14,493
Go on, get on with your eating, eh?

368
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,900
It's only Mitchel making a fool of himself.

369
00:40:18,007 --> 00:40:20,999
Now, stand in the corner.
Cory, make him a paper hat.

370
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,238
Stand in the corner like a naughty little boy.

371
00:40:24,346 --> 00:40:27,645
Stand there. Take your knife and fork with you.

372
00:40:27,783 --> 00:40:30,479
- Don't be stupid.
- Do you want to join him?

373
00:40:30,653 --> 00:40:37,525
Leave him alone. He's only copying you
like he always does. You behave, he'll behave.

374
00:40:37,693 --> 00:40:40,457
- I'm leaving.
- Yes, we are leaving.

375
00:40:40,629 --> 00:40:45,464
Gracie, here. Pay the bill and take a taxi.

376
00:40:46,635 --> 00:40:50,799
Yeah. Georgie and I might go for a little drive.

377
00:40:52,675 --> 00:40:55,769
It's our wedding anniversary tomorrow.

378
00:40:55,878 --> 00:40:58,472
Might drive down to the sea,

379
00:40:58,647 --> 00:41:01,480
have some fun under the pier like we used to.

380
00:41:12,027 --> 00:41:14,825
Oops. I am sorry.

381
00:41:14,997 --> 00:41:18,763
Still, this isn't a library, it's a restaurant.

382
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,959
They got people for that.

383
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,465
Richard.

384
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:30,875
This needs cooking.
Grill it with some mashed peas.

385
00:41:41,523 --> 00:41:45,892
# Wash me thoroughly

386
00:41:46,028 --> 00:41:49,828
# From my iniquity

387
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:55,235
# And cleanse me... #

388
00:41:55,504 --> 00:41:58,505
What's a young lad like you doing
washing dishes?

389
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,668
That's woman's work,
ain't you got what it takes? Hey!

390
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:06,370
My God, armor plating.
You protect yourself, son, you need it.

391
00:42:06,515 --> 00:42:09,678
Innocence. That's what I had before I met Georgie.

392
00:42:09,785 --> 00:42:13,118
- That's just what they want.
- Albert. Come on, you're drunk.

393
00:42:13,255 --> 00:42:15,416
- Come on!
- Shall I sing for you?

394
00:42:15,524 --> 00:42:18,550
- What?
- Albert, come on, he's only a child.

395
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:22,256
Sing for me, yes. Yes, you can sing for me.

396
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:24,797
Get up there. You sing, yeah.

397
00:42:24,967 --> 00:42:29,631
I was a good singer when I was a little boy,
wasn't I, Georgie?

398
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,539
Come on, now. You sing to me. Eh?

399
00:42:33,876 --> 00:42:35,969
Come on. Sing, damn you!

400
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:41,709
# Wash me thoroughly

401
00:42:41,984 --> 00:42:45,579
# From my iniquity

402
00:42:45,754 --> 00:42:49,952
- # And cleanse... #
- You can't keep it up, can you? No.

403
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:52,740
I was a choirboy once.

404
00:42:52,775 --> 00:42:55,421
Yes. Women like choirboys.

405
00:42:55,564 --> 00:42:59,159
I was almost a choirboy when I met Georgie.

406
00:42:59,435 --> 00:43:02,097
But you spoilt all that, didn't you?

407
00:43:02,304 --> 00:43:06,673
Georgie was a very good education,
she could teach a young man anything.

408
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:11,212
Come on, Georgie, show the young boy
what you showed me.

409
00:43:11,346 --> 00:43:14,042
- Albert.
- Go on, show the little boy...

410
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:17,447
- Albert!
- You do what I tell you, will you?

411
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:22,012
You come out in that car park with me,
both of you. Come on.

412
00:43:22,157 --> 00:43:25,217
Out in the car park. Come on.

413
00:43:29,631 --> 00:43:34,261
I'll give you the best education,
show you what a great teacher Georgie can be.

414
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,597
Don't touch him!

415
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:40,903
Leave him alone.
I'll show you what a great teacher...

416
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:46,106
Oh, I see. So I'm not supposed to do that?
I'll give you an education.

417
00:43:46,215 --> 00:43:48,706
- Albert, please leave him alone.
- Oh, no.

418
00:43:48,851 --> 00:43:51,547
Stand there and don't you move.

419
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,745
- Just leave him be.
- Watch this.

420
00:43:53,856 --> 00:43:58,225
- No. Wait till we get home, Albert.
- Georgie. Georgie, come here.

421
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,854
Right. What's all this?
You're not wearing any bloody knickers.

422
00:44:02,998 --> 00:44:06,456
You've been sitting in that restaurant
with no knickers on?

423
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:10,732
With Cory and Mitchel and all those people?
What's this mean?

424
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:13,171
Where are they? Give them to me at once.

425
00:44:13,308 --> 00:44:17,608
Go on. Look at this.
Get in that car, you dirty whore.

426
00:44:17,713 --> 00:44:20,409
Why don't you take everything off?

427
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:26,020
Get in there. Go on! Get in that car!

428
00:44:26,155 --> 00:44:29,818
- Now you! You get in there as well.
- No!

429
00:44:29,992 --> 00:44:34,395
- Go on. Get in there. Get in.
- No! Please!

430
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:38,125
- No! No! No!
- Get in there! Get in.

431
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,564
Aah! Ah!

432
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,534
Right...

433
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:49,904
No!

434
00:44:56,151 --> 00:45:00,281
# Wash me thoroughly

435
00:45:00,389 --> 00:45:04,189
# From my iniquity

436
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:13,665
# And cleanse me from my sins

437
00:45:15,604 --> 00:45:22,203
# Have mercy upon me... #

438
00:45:24,646 --> 00:45:26,807
I have two minutes.

439
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:59,545
# Purge me with hyssop

440
00:46:02,251 --> 00:46:04,344
# And I shall be

441
00:46:05,654 --> 00:46:07,713
# Clean

442
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:12,351
# Wash me

443
00:46:12,794 --> 00:46:16,389
# Wash me

444
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:24,165
# And I shall be whiter than snow

445
00:46:26,141 --> 00:46:29,872
# Make me to hear

446
00:46:30,045 --> 00:46:38,885
# Thy joy and gladness #

447
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,578
# That the bones

448
00:46:41,723 --> 00:46:50,631
# That Thou hast broken may rejoice #

449
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:54,591
Do you know, Mitchel, what prairie oysters are?

450
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,625
Fish.

451
00:47:57,799 --> 00:48:02,236
So if someone feeds you a prairie oyster,
what would you be eating?

452
00:48:02,371 --> 00:48:06,398
Fish. Like from the lakes and that. They're the...

453
00:48:06,441 --> 00:48:08,739
The clams with the little pearls in.

454
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:13,607
Prairie oysters would be very precious
to their owners. No.

455
00:48:13,782 --> 00:48:15,773
No, look. Imagine...

456
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:19,150
Just imagine that this is a prairie oyster.

457
00:48:20,389 --> 00:48:24,257
Now, go on. Eat that. Go on.
Put it in your mouth. Go on. Go on.

458
00:48:24,426 --> 00:48:27,020
Now, what's it taste like?

459
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:31,525
- Wet bread.
- No.

460
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:34,466
It's all squishy with gritty bits in it.

461
00:48:36,304 --> 00:48:38,602
That's the sand.

462
00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:43,442
That's the sand. You're a comic.

463
00:48:43,612 --> 00:48:47,207
No, you mule. It's got a skin round it.

464
00:48:50,485 --> 00:48:52,646
- Do you spit the skin out?
- No.

465
00:48:52,754 --> 00:48:55,917
Pick it out of your teeth afterwards, chump it up.

466
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:59,186
Now, swallow that, go on, swallow it. Swallow it.

467
00:48:59,294 --> 00:49:01,261
Go on, that's right.

468
00:49:01,296 --> 00:49:05,460
Now, Mitchel, you have just eaten
a sheep's bollock.

469
00:49:11,273 --> 00:49:14,606
The next time I ask you to work for me, Mitchel,

470
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:18,645
I'll be expecting you to chew
someone's bollocks off on demand.

471
00:49:20,482 --> 00:49:22,473
Oh, you're back.

472
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:28,022
What do you find in that toilet that's so fascinating?
I'll go and have a pee and a look.

473
00:49:28,156 --> 00:49:33,184
What have they got since I was last in there?
Velvet seats, dirty pictures? Hah.

474
00:49:33,295 --> 00:49:36,822
Free perfume? A private drinks bar?

475
00:50:07,729 --> 00:50:10,459
Cor, what a disgusting smell in here!

476
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:14,295
Must be the pigs using it, eh? How disgusting it is.

477
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:18,667
Ha! Urgh, how horrible. Disgusting.

478
00:50:18,773 --> 00:50:22,038
Revolting place, needs airing out. What's this?

479
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,544
Gaw, phwoar, phwoar...

480
00:50:25,714 --> 00:50:30,583
Look. "There was a young man from Uckinham
who got caught while he was..."

481
00:50:30,752 --> 00:50:35,086
That is disgusting!
People ought to be locked up for that.

482
00:50:35,223 --> 00:50:38,351
Absolutely appalling. Not what I'm used to at all.

483
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:42,021
It's disgraceful. Don't you reckon, don't you think?

484
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,325
Yes. God.

485
00:50:44,432 --> 00:50:47,629
- 'Ere, what are you looking at?
- What are you talking about?

486
00:50:47,736 --> 00:50:52,070
Don't pretend. You're waiting
for my young associates, aren't you?

487
00:50:52,107 --> 00:50:55,304
A man ought to be able to piss
without harassment.

488
00:50:55,544 --> 00:50:58,536
- How dare you? I'm getting the manager.
- I am the manager.

489
00:51:02,884 --> 00:51:05,375
- Ow!
- Yeah.

490
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,786
That's what these people need.
Short, sharp, shock treatment.

491
00:51:18,233 --> 00:51:20,497
Hello. What are you doing? Reading again?

492
00:51:20,602 --> 00:51:25,733
This is not a library. The only thing
you're allowed to read in here is the menu.

493
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,331
You are insulting the chef.

494
00:51:28,476 --> 00:51:31,707
Reading gives you indigestion,
didn't you know that?

495
00:51:31,813 --> 00:51:34,111
Don't read at the table.

496
00:51:36,484 --> 00:51:40,250
I've just been reading stuff to make your hair curl.

497
00:51:40,422 --> 00:51:42,686
Out there, in the toilet.

498
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:45,954
That's the sort of stuff people read, not this.

499
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,495
Don't you feel out of touch?

500
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:51,030
Does this stuff make money?

501
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:55,660
You know, I bet you're
the only man who's read this book.

502
00:51:55,804 --> 00:51:59,638
But I bet you every man here
has read that stuff out there.

503
00:51:59,808 --> 00:52:02,106
It makes you think, doesn't it?

504
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:06,544
You know, I reckon you read
because you got nobody to talk to.

505
00:52:06,681 --> 00:52:11,311
I tell you what. So you shouldn't eat alone,
why don't you come and join us?

506
00:52:11,486 --> 00:52:13,613
Come and meet my wife.

507
00:52:13,722 --> 00:52:19,319
She's seen you.
I know she's sorry for you sitting here all alone.

508
00:52:19,461 --> 00:52:24,489
She likes to read too.
She spends hours sitting on the bed reading.

509
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,999
She even reads on the john.

510
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,535
This is Cory.

511
00:52:38,713 --> 00:52:43,241
This is Mitchel. He can't read, can you, Mitchel?

512
00:52:43,385 --> 00:52:46,218
- Yes, I can.
- Yeah. Comics and dirty magazines.

513
00:52:47,389 --> 00:52:51,189
And this is Georgina. She is my wife.

514
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:55,022
What's your name?

515
00:52:56,131 --> 00:53:00,761
- Michael.
- Well, Michael. Is that a Jewish name, Michael?

516
00:53:00,935 --> 00:53:06,305
Do you eat kosher food, Michael? Sit down,
Michael, and tell us all about kosher food, Michael.

517
00:53:06,441 --> 00:53:09,467
- I'm sorry but I'm not Jewish.
- Why hide it?

518
00:53:09,577 --> 00:53:14,139
60% of the people in this restaurant
are a touch Jewish, Michael.

519
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,477
Richard, set another place for Michael.

520
00:53:16,584 --> 00:53:21,783
He is Jewish, so maybe you could find him
some spare ribs. No pork.

521
00:53:23,024 --> 00:53:28,428
He won't need those.
We're going to hold a conversation, aren't we?

522
00:53:28,563 --> 00:53:32,363
You can start, Georgie.
Tell Michael all about yourself.

523
00:53:33,468 --> 00:53:37,768
- I'm sure your wife would rather eat in peace.
- No. Talk, Georgina.

524
00:53:37,872 --> 00:53:41,501
Here's your chance
to improve your table conversation.

525
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,803
Tell Michael you live in a big house

526
00:53:43,912 --> 00:53:46,574
and you spend £400 a week on clothes.

527
00:53:46,748 --> 00:53:48,807
I spend £400 a week on clothes.

528
00:53:48,917 --> 00:53:52,216
You have a petrol allowance of £40 a week.

529
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:56,120
I have a petrol allowance of £40 a week,
which I never use.

530
00:53:56,257 --> 00:53:58,987
- You wear beautiful things.
- I wear beautiful things.

531
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:02,459
- You eat in the best restaurants.
- I eat in the best restaurants.

532
00:54:02,597 --> 00:54:05,293
Georgina, try a little harder, please.

533
00:54:07,469 --> 00:54:11,064
- I go to a good hairdresser.
- Yes, the best there is.

534
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:15,434
- I go to a good dentist.
- Yes, yeah, oh, yeah. He's Jewish.

535
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:18,808
- I go to a good gynecologist.
- You what?

536
00:54:18,913 --> 00:54:23,782
- Who says it's unlikely I'll ever have a baby.
- Michael doesn't want to know that.

537
00:54:23,952 --> 00:54:27,353
That the three miscarriages
have ruined my insides.

538
00:54:27,489 --> 00:54:31,050
That isn't true, Michael doesn't need to know that.

539
00:54:31,192 --> 00:54:35,219
Now, drink up, Michael, let's talk about you.
What do you do?

540
00:54:37,632 --> 00:54:39,964
I'm a gynecologist.

541
00:54:41,436 --> 00:54:44,633
- You're a what?
- You could always come and see me.

542
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:47,230
We don't need to discuss that subject.

543
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:51,140
Being infertile makes me a safe bet
for a good screw.

544
00:54:51,312 --> 00:54:53,405
Shut up, Georgie!

545
00:54:57,018 --> 00:54:59,509
I must apologize for my wife, Michael.

546
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:05,154
If you don't get back to your table,
you're in danger of losing it.

547
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,353
The place gets very full about now.

548
00:55:07,462 --> 00:55:11,956
Mitchel, take Michael back to his table.
Tell him about horses.

549
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,694
Oh, it's all right, Mr. Spica, thank you.

550
00:55:15,837 --> 00:55:17,930
I prefer to read my book.

551
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,531
Besides, I've finished. Thank you.

552
00:55:23,011 --> 00:55:26,378
Thank you for introducing me to your wife.

553
00:55:26,514 --> 00:55:29,381
I like your name.

554
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,624
Ah.

555
00:56:23,204 --> 00:56:27,038
What the hell do you think you're doing? Eh?

556
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:33,340
Telling a complete stranger
intimate details about us?

557
00:56:33,448 --> 00:56:36,008
It's not about us. It's about me.

558
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:38,641
It's about us!

559
00:56:38,786 --> 00:56:42,244
And what's all this,
how much time you spend in that loo?

560
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:45,484
What's all this about a gynecologist? Who is he?

561
00:56:45,593 --> 00:56:50,895
Lt'd better be a she.
I don't want some bloke fingering my wife about.

562
00:56:50,999 --> 00:56:54,230
It's a man. He's Jewish.

563
00:56:54,335 --> 00:56:57,702
- And he's from Ethiopia.
- What?

564
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,742
His mother is a Roman Catholic,
he's been in prison in South Africa,

565
00:57:02,911 --> 00:57:06,938
he's as black as the ace of spades
and probably drinks his own pee.

566
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:09,278
- Take that, you bitch!
- Oh!

567
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:13,115
You lying, ungrateful bitch! You get in that car.

568
00:57:13,288 --> 00:57:15,779
It's the doghouse for you, you bitch.

569
00:57:15,924 --> 00:57:20,793
Bloody gynecologist. Blasted gynecologist.

570
00:57:23,631 --> 00:57:25,792
Get up. Get up.

571
00:57:28,102 --> 00:57:31,128
Get in the car, you slag.

572
00:57:32,507 --> 00:57:34,771
Get in there. Go on.

573
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:39,736
Yeah.

574
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,632
Maiser came here.

575
00:58:07,742 --> 00:58:12,543
And Trelawny with his black lady friends
who wore peaches in their hair.

576
00:58:12,714 --> 00:58:14,909
- Peaches?
- Imitation.

577
00:58:15,016 --> 00:58:19,612
And the Austrian brothers sat by the door -
high-wire professionals.

578
00:58:19,754 --> 00:58:22,086
Great balancers, sloppy with money.

579
00:58:22,223 --> 00:58:29,425
And Tim Tranter drank soup here
out of a cup with a straw when his jaw was broken.

580
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:34,729
There used to be a mark up there
where Goshy Capps threw a plate of kippers.

581
00:58:34,836 --> 00:58:37,430
- Kippers?
- Yes, kippers, for God's sake.

582
00:58:37,572 --> 00:58:39,904
You wouldn't find kippers here.

583
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:43,943
- They serve kippers for breakfast here.
- You've had breakfast here?

584
00:58:44,012 --> 00:58:47,038
The ferryman and his lady ate here every morning.

585
00:58:47,248 --> 00:58:51,582
The ferryman was a poofter.
And fish disagreed with him.

586
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:56,019
- Who are all these people?
- Small-time crooks and pimps...

587
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:59,456
Boarst painted it out.
I'll get him to paint it back again.

588
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:03,257
...gigolos, busted boxers, cheap whores...

589
00:59:03,431 --> 00:59:05,695
I've got the clippings at home.

590
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,894
...bullies, hairdressers, faggots.

591
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:11,528
- Robin Hoods.
- No, just hoods.

592
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:16,906
You're getting very smart.
Smart? Even his slang's out of date.

593
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:20,503
Now I'm the clientele,
you understand? Me.

594
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:24,550
And Georgie here and Cory Peterson.
The coq au vin is good.

595
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:28,849
Cock a what?
Chicken cooked in wine, you mule.

596
00:59:28,956 --> 00:59:33,359
- Bess Riddle lived on coq au vin.
- More of the coq than the vin.

597
00:59:33,494 --> 00:59:37,157
Starkie, there are ladies present.

598
00:59:37,331 --> 00:59:41,165
- Or there were. Where's she gone?
- Gracie's no lady, are you?

599
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:44,467
- She must have a bladder infection.
- She's one of us.

600
00:59:44,739 --> 00:59:48,505
There's nothing wrong
except she disappears to the john.

601
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:52,077
And which of the bladder infections
do you have, Starkie?

602
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,511
Ladies go to the toilet, not the john.

603
00:59:54,615 --> 00:59:58,949
Real ladies don't go to the toilet,
they go to the bathroom.

604
00:59:59,754 --> 01:00:03,520
Boarst hasn't got a bathroom.
Shut your mouth.

605
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:07,991
You'd pee in your pants
before you'd recognize a respectable WC.

606
01:00:16,537 --> 01:00:19,563
So, he's broken the silence for us

607
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:23,373
and your name is Georgina.

608
01:00:25,513 --> 01:00:30,212
Yes. And don't ever call me Georgie.

609
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:34,813
You have beautiful eyes, Georgina.

610
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:43,864
And you have a beautiful prick, Mr. Gynecologist.

611
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:48,998
- I have?
- Yes, whatever its racist beliefs.

612
01:00:52,573 --> 01:00:56,236
- Your husband is a curiosity.
- He is?

613
01:01:01,415 --> 01:01:03,781
Why?

614
01:01:03,918 --> 01:01:05,977
Why what?

615
01:01:08,723 --> 01:01:10,748
Why am I married to him?

616
01:01:13,494 --> 01:01:15,519
Why aren't you married?

617
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,190
- How do you know I'm not?
- You're not.

618
01:01:21,035 --> 01:01:23,230
- I'm not.
- Why?

619
01:01:28,576 --> 01:01:33,479
I once saw a film in which the main character
didn't speak for the first half an hour.

620
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:38,881
Like us? Do all the minutes we've been together
add up to half an hour?

621
01:01:41,622 --> 01:01:47,185
I was completely absorbed as to what would
happen because anything was possible.

622
01:01:48,896 --> 01:01:51,364
And then?

623
01:01:51,399 --> 01:01:54,562
He spoilt it - he spoke.

624
01:01:56,470 --> 01:02:00,099
- And?
- Within five minutes, I'd lost interest.

625
01:02:01,876 --> 01:02:06,438
So now you've opened your mouth,
do you expect me to lose interest?

626
01:02:08,149 --> 01:02:10,344
It was only a film.

627
01:02:15,156 --> 01:02:18,455
Erm, now, we've been talking for one minute.

628
01:02:19,594 --> 01:02:23,086
We've got four minutes left
before you lose interest.

629
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:25,722
Four minutes. That's enough.

630
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:28,028
Where's the bomb?

631
01:02:28,135 --> 01:02:35,541
He's, er... He's eating
avocado vinaigrette and prawns.

632
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,937
With his fingers.

633
01:02:40,815 --> 01:02:42,806
Kiss me.

634
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:52,416
- Your restaurant's noisy, Spica.
- It's popular on a Sunday night.

635
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:55,156
I like a quiet restaurant, with floor shows.

636
01:02:55,329 --> 01:02:59,095
Boarst is a culinary artist, not a fancy entertainer.

637
01:02:59,267 --> 01:03:02,828
But we're here to please you, Terry.
We'll get you a floor show.

638
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:07,236
Cory, phone Santini. Five girls - strippers.

639
01:03:07,341 --> 01:03:10,333
Make it decent, will you? My daughter's present.

640
01:03:10,444 --> 01:03:14,346
Five dancing girls with music.
Strictly no filth, only class.

641
01:03:14,515 --> 01:03:17,550
And make it quiet.
I want to keep my ears till I'm 90.

642
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:22,079
God, Terry, what sort of floor show
do you like? Mute nuns?

643
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:27,054
If they call me Mr. Fitch, I might.
I'm only Terry to my wife, Spica.

644
01:03:27,228 --> 01:03:29,856
- Like me.
- You're Terry and all, are you?

645
01:03:30,031 --> 01:03:33,797
- I'm only Albert to Georgina.
- Even when she's in the loo?

646
01:03:33,968 --> 01:03:37,426
- Shut your whore up, Cory!
- God, you're noisy, Spica.

647
01:03:37,571 --> 01:03:41,405
Makes for indigestion.
Don't you find, love? What's your name?

648
01:03:41,575 --> 01:03:42,906
Patricia, Mr. Fitch.

649
01:03:43,044 --> 01:03:47,081
Are you a good dancer?
You look as if you might be a good dancer.

650
01:03:47,116 --> 01:03:50,915
We'd like to see you get up and dance, with Geoff.

651
01:03:51,218 --> 01:03:53,482
Geoff's a very good dancer.

652
01:03:53,587 --> 01:03:57,216
- There's no dancing allowed.
- I always eat at home.

653
01:03:57,391 --> 01:03:59,791
- Best place.
- No food poisoning.

654
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:04,989
Ricky Boarst is as safe as houses.
He keeps a very clean kitchen, go and see.

655
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:07,260
I'd like to see.

656
01:04:07,368 --> 01:04:12,772
- Mitchel, take the lady to see the kitchen.
- I'll take her myself, Spica.

657
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:19,038
- Show me the way.
- Through that door.

658
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:23,310
I'll call in the bathroom
and send Georgie back tout de suite.

659
01:04:23,417 --> 01:04:25,578
That means immediately.

660
01:04:25,686 --> 01:04:30,214
- Your new girlfriend's cheap, Cory.
- She's only practicing her French.

661
01:04:30,358 --> 01:04:32,656
It's a French restaurant, isn't it?

662
01:04:56,617 --> 01:04:59,245
Someone's having pheasant for dinner.

663
01:05:04,759 --> 01:05:08,024
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

664
01:05:09,063 --> 01:05:13,056
We could be interrupted, um... 700 times.

665
01:05:14,902 --> 01:05:20,704
- What's your boyfriend paying you, Patricia?
- Paying me? He doesn't pay me.

666
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,742
He buys me meals and drinks.

667
01:05:23,911 --> 01:05:26,937
- Doesn't he give you no pocket money?
- No.

668
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:30,643
Nothing for a tuna fish sandwich
late at night or a bottle of gin

669
01:05:30,818 --> 01:05:34,083
- to make you forget what you had for lunch?
- No.

670
01:05:34,188 --> 01:05:37,555
Phew, it stinks here.

671
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,451
Listen, how about if...

672
01:05:43,497 --> 01:05:45,624
if I gave you some pocket money?

673
01:05:47,101 --> 01:05:49,160
What do I have to do to earn it?

674
01:06:10,658 --> 01:06:13,286
OK, here they are. Where's Fitch?

675
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:16,957
Phillipe, clear those tables. We need more space.

676
01:06:17,131 --> 01:06:20,225
- But Mr. Spica, they are eating.
- Move them.

677
01:06:20,334 --> 01:06:24,498
You are in the way of the floor show.
You're gonna have to move.

678
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:26,664
We're in the middle of our meal.

679
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:31,370
If you're going to eat quite quickly,
you can finish your soup.

680
01:06:32,313 --> 01:06:35,840
After all, you don't want
to get trampled on, do you?

681
01:06:37,184 --> 01:06:39,379
Hold him. Hold him.

682
01:06:42,723 --> 01:06:45,317
It's a pity you didn't take my advice.

683
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:48,860
All that lovely food. Richard will be disappointed.

684
01:06:48,996 --> 01:06:54,866
Now, you're gonna have to eat in the kitchen
like naughty little children, eh?

685
01:06:55,035 --> 01:06:57,435
Hey, what is your name?

686
01:06:57,571 --> 01:07:01,166
What did you say? Did I hear you say William?

687
01:07:01,342 --> 01:07:05,142
Well, naughty little Willie, tiny little Willie,

688
01:07:05,346 --> 01:07:09,112
how would you like
to be spanked on your big, fat bottom?

689
01:07:17,525 --> 01:07:22,121
Seeing as you're so keen
on Richard's mushrooms, William,

690
01:07:22,263 --> 01:07:27,360
you, I'm gonna give you five, the count of five

691
01:07:27,468 --> 01:07:31,268
and I want to see you on the way to the kitchen

692
01:07:31,438 --> 01:07:33,497
or you'll be out in the street!

693
01:07:33,607 --> 01:07:35,632
Get out.

694
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:54,953
# I am waiting, I am waiting

695
01:07:55,996 --> 01:08:00,296
# Come up with something sometime now

696
01:08:01,468 --> 01:08:06,337
# We're only here for love... #

697
01:08:06,473 --> 01:08:09,909
- Oh, look at the time. I must go back.
- One minute more.

698
01:08:10,144 --> 01:08:12,738
- No.
- 30 seconds.

699
01:08:25,326 --> 01:08:28,090
Oh! Oh!

700
01:08:28,295 --> 01:08:30,695
Oh. What the hell are you doing?

701
01:08:31,832 --> 01:08:35,029
I bought meself a ride. Why don't you keep still?

702
01:08:35,135 --> 01:08:36,932
Sorry, I had a surprise.

703
01:08:38,105 --> 01:08:42,838
What bloody surprises
could there be possibly left for you?

704
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:45,103
I give up, you bitch.

705
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:48,613
I'm sick ofjumpy whores.

706
01:08:49,617 --> 01:08:54,782
You're only worth a Fitch one star -
that ain't for looks, that's for availability.

707
01:08:54,888 --> 01:08:57,152
# I am waiting

708
01:08:58,192 --> 01:09:00,251
# I am waiting

709
01:09:01,362 --> 01:09:05,492
# Come up with something sometime now

710
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,730
# We're only here for love

711
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:14,273
# Outside the reach of money

712
01:09:14,408 --> 01:09:16,774
# Beyond the reach of fame

713
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:21,472
# We're not for buying or lending out... #

714
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:24,516
Look who's just come out of the woodwork.

715
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:32,324
# Be quick and be tight

716
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:35,053
# And be it not and be right

717
01:09:35,229 --> 01:09:37,857
# Then be slow and... #

718
01:09:37,931 --> 01:09:43,494
- What've you been doing?
- I've just been earning you good money.

719
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:47,535
And I've just seen
how we can earn ourselves some more.

720
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:51,842
# Then go #

721
01:10:01,455 --> 01:10:07,325
We have complaints of offensive smells
from two vans on the restaurant premises.

722
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:10,554
The restaurant denies any responsibility. Over.

723
01:10:13,467 --> 01:10:15,367
Why can't we meet somewhere else?

724
01:10:15,402 --> 01:10:19,930
That's impossible.
It's better to do it under his nose.

725
01:10:20,107 --> 01:10:23,975
He'll never believe I do it right under his nose

726
01:10:25,946 --> 01:10:28,414
between courses,

727
01:10:28,549 --> 01:10:31,382
between the hors d'oeuvres
and the canard à I'orange,

728
01:10:31,552 --> 01:10:33,816
between the dessert and the coffee.

729
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:37,320
Besides,

730
01:10:38,592 --> 01:10:40,583
I'm learning fast

731
01:10:41,829 --> 01:10:43,922
how to cut corners, save time.

732
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:49,628
I'm getting good at it, aren't I, Michael? Aren't I?

733
01:10:51,105 --> 01:10:53,471
Aren't I getting good at it? Aren't I?

734
01:10:54,608 --> 01:10:57,008
Aren't I getting good at it? Mm.

735
01:10:58,345 --> 01:11:00,506
Aren't I getting good at it? Oh.

736
01:11:07,254 --> 01:11:10,815
Last night was bloody awful
and you're to blame, Cory.

737
01:11:10,858 --> 01:11:14,658
- Tonight you'll starve.
- I don't like the foreign muck anyway.

738
01:11:14,962 --> 01:11:19,990
Don't talk to me like that, you uneducated prat!
You couldn't organize a rape in a brothel!

739
01:11:21,034 --> 01:11:26,199
The girls were lousy, the music was lousy,
you mucked the whole thing up.

740
01:11:26,306 --> 01:11:29,576
Couldn't keep your own girl
under control at all. Tch!

741
01:11:29,611 --> 01:11:32,272
- First she shows off...
- I didn't.

742
01:11:32,546 --> 01:11:35,037
Shut your face, who's talking to you?

743
01:11:35,182 --> 01:11:37,349
Then she goes and plays hard to get.

744
01:11:37,384 --> 01:11:41,844
I mean, if she's been with you, Cory,
how the hell can she be hard to get?

745
01:11:45,726 --> 01:11:49,526
Spangler, get us a drink, quickly.
Then she upsets Fitch in some way.

746
01:11:49,696 --> 01:11:52,529
- Fitch is a pig.
- Fitch has got manners.

747
01:11:52,699 --> 01:11:55,793
He was like a bear with a sore head.
Did you piss in his pants?

748
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:59,896
Then she's giggling like a virgin
playing with a candle.

749
01:12:00,007 --> 01:12:04,910
You'll have to make it up to him.
He likes you, though you look like a bloke.

750
01:12:05,078 --> 01:12:08,741
- Perhaps he likes blokes.
- None of that homosexual talk.

751
01:12:08,916 --> 01:12:12,215
He'll remember.
Yesterday evening's got my name on it.

752
01:12:12,352 --> 01:12:16,652
I'm not going with him.
He sweats and stinks and he can't make it.

753
01:12:16,757 --> 01:12:19,157
- Shut your whore up, Cory.
- Like Georgie?

754
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:22,592
- Shut up!
- She's a fine woman. She's never let me down.

755
01:12:22,729 --> 01:12:25,220
- You must be joking.
- Shut up, Pat!

756
01:12:25,365 --> 01:12:28,061
- She's upset.
- What do you mean, I must be joking?

757
01:12:28,235 --> 01:12:31,102
- Here. Get rid of her.
- Don't do that to a woman.

758
01:12:31,271 --> 01:12:34,406
- I do what I like to a woman.
- That's your trouble.

759
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:38,605
No wonder Georgie looks like she does
and hates your guts.

760
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:42,077
- What are you talking about?
- No wonder she screws around.

761
01:12:42,182 --> 01:12:45,777
- You what?
- You're so bloody blind, you'd never notice.

762
01:12:45,953 --> 01:12:48,717
- Shut up! She's raving.
- I'm not. I saw them.

763
01:12:48,889 --> 01:12:50,856
- Who?
- Georgie and that Jew.

764
01:12:50,891 --> 01:12:54,622
- What Jew?
- That bloke who sits over there, reading.

765
01:12:54,895 --> 01:12:58,763
Haven't you noticed?
They always go off to the john together.

766
01:12:58,932 --> 01:13:03,050
- You what?
- Why do you think Georgie's always in the john?

767
01:13:03,085 --> 01:13:07,169
You blind bat.
She doesn't have the shits every five minutes.

768
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:10,238
Shit!

769
01:13:15,849 --> 01:13:20,115
Shh. It's all right. It's all right. Shh. Quiet.

770
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:22,379
Shh. Shh.

771
01:13:24,224 --> 01:13:26,249
Shh.

772
01:13:49,249 --> 01:13:51,376
I'm going to the loo.

773
01:14:00,594 --> 01:14:02,459
Georgina!

774
01:14:04,765 --> 01:14:06,756
Georgina!

775
01:14:07,701 --> 01:14:11,000
Georgina, where are you, you bitch? Georgina!

776
01:14:11,605 --> 01:14:15,666
- What are you doing? Get out!
- Get out, you bitch. Georgina!

777
01:14:15,776 --> 01:14:17,767
Where are you? Get out!

778
01:14:17,878 --> 01:14:20,005
Go on, get out!

779
01:14:20,113 --> 01:14:22,308
Where are you?

780
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:26,182
- No, please!
- Get out of here! Get out, you...

781
01:14:26,353 --> 01:14:30,414
Please, no! Please, no!

782
01:14:30,524 --> 01:14:33,152
- Go on! Georgie!
- Please, no.

783
01:14:33,694 --> 01:14:35,719
Where are you, Georgie?

784
01:14:49,843 --> 01:14:54,303
It's over. He has found out.

785
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:58,111
Georgina? Georgina!

786
01:14:58,285 --> 01:15:00,549
Georgina!

787
01:15:00,654 --> 01:15:03,714
Georgie! You get out.

788
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:08,390
I'll get him to leave.

789
01:15:08,562 --> 01:15:12,589
- Richard, don't get into trouble over me.
- Georgie!

790
01:15:14,601 --> 01:15:17,968
- Let's go and face him.
- Don't be mad. He'll kill you!

791
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:20,569
Come quickly. Come with me.

792
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:29,615
- Wait here five minutes.
- We'll freeze to death.

793
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:34,019
He will never look in here.
Only five minutes. I will get your clothes.

794
01:15:34,187 --> 01:15:37,486
Georgie, where are you?

795
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:43,762
Georgina! Georgie, where are you?

796
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:46,057
Georgie. Georgie.

797
01:15:48,101 --> 01:15:50,228
You! Where is she? Where's my wife?

798
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:53,636
- What's the matter?
- You know. Fetching her cigarettes.

799
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:56,868
- Where's my wife?
- Your wife is your affair.

800
01:15:56,977 --> 01:15:59,445
This is not a lost property office.

801
01:15:59,579 --> 01:16:02,013
I want my wife! Where is she?

802
01:16:02,149 --> 01:16:05,949
You! You stupid little rat.
Where's my wife? Where is she?

803
01:16:06,119 --> 01:16:10,419
If you have finished,
I'll ask you to leave the kitchen.

804
01:16:10,557 --> 01:16:14,618
- I have other diners to consider.
- Oh! Uh!

805
01:16:14,728 --> 01:16:18,494
I'm the only diner who matters here.
I own this restaurant.

806
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:21,862
I want my wife. You've hidden her. Where is she?

807
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:25,201
God keep me calm! Where are they?

808
01:16:25,338 --> 01:16:27,829
Georgina! Georgina!

809
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:32,003
- Georgina! Georgina!
- Ahh!

810
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:36,273
Georgina! Where is she, Boarst?

811
01:16:39,186 --> 01:16:43,782
Boarst, where is she? Georgie! Georgie!

812
01:16:45,025 --> 01:16:47,619
Georgie, you bitch!

813
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:51,386
Hard around.

814
01:16:55,302 --> 01:16:58,601
Georgie! I want my wife!

815
01:17:07,814 --> 01:17:09,805
Georgie!

816
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,678
I'll bloody find her.

817
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:17,781
I'll bloody find her.

818
01:17:17,891 --> 01:17:23,090
I'll find them. I'll bloody find them.
I knew it. Scheming tart!

819
01:17:23,196 --> 01:17:25,824
I'll bloody find them and I'll bloody kill him!

820
01:17:25,999 --> 01:17:28,024
And I'll bloody eat him!

821
01:17:28,135 --> 01:17:30,797
I'll kill him and I'll eat him!

822
01:17:31,471 --> 01:17:35,567
- I'll kill him and then I'll eat him.
- Oh, shit!

823
01:17:35,809 --> 01:17:38,903
I'll eat him!

824
01:17:40,347 --> 01:17:42,347
I'll eat him!

825
01:17:42,382 --> 01:17:47,376
We can get you out.
Eden can drive you. Where do you want to go?

826
01:17:47,587 --> 01:17:49,782
I know a place.

827
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:53,553
- What about our clothes?
- I'll get them to you. Quickly.

828
01:17:54,694 --> 01:17:56,753
Quickly. Quick.

829
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:18,212
No. No. No, no.

830
01:18:18,385 --> 01:18:21,445
No, please. Aah! No.

831
01:20:02,722 --> 01:20:05,020
What is this place?

832
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:07,116
It's a book depository.

833
01:20:08,228 --> 01:20:12,130
When my bookshop is quiet,
I do a stocktaking job.

834
01:20:13,633 --> 01:20:16,830
I'm cataloguing French history.

835
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,136
There's a kitchen and a bathroom.

836
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:27,440
It's a bit primitive but there's an extraordinary view.

837
01:20:27,547 --> 01:20:29,845
Have you read all these books?

838
01:20:29,983 --> 01:20:32,076
No.

839
01:20:32,185 --> 01:20:37,885
It's not necessary
for the book-keeper to read all the stock.

840
01:20:38,058 --> 01:20:41,221
With a job like this, you could be very boring.

841
01:20:43,663 --> 01:20:45,858
Are we safe here?

842
01:20:48,435 --> 01:20:50,232
Does Albert read?

843
01:20:51,404 --> 01:20:52,962
No.

844
01:20:55,308 --> 01:20:57,936
If you don't read, does that make you safe?

845
01:20:58,111 --> 01:21:00,306
Only from bad books.

846
01:21:02,215 --> 01:21:05,207
You could spend a lifetime in here reading.

847
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:11,814
You could. Two lifetimes - yours and mine.

848
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:14,517
- Is that what I'm in for?
- No.

849
01:21:19,599 --> 01:21:23,660
What good are all these books to you?
You can't eat them.

850
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:26,534
How can they make you happy?

851
01:21:26,706 --> 01:21:29,470
I've always found them very reasonable.

852
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:32,941
They don't change their minds
when you're not looking.

853
01:21:33,046 --> 01:21:35,674
That sounds like a disadvantage to me.

854
01:21:38,251 --> 01:21:40,446
Kiss me.

855
01:21:41,187 --> 01:21:45,419
# Wash me thoroughly

856
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:48,824
# From my iniquity

857
01:21:49,596 --> 01:21:52,030
# And blot out... #

858
01:21:53,099 --> 01:21:55,397
- I...
- # Blot out... #

859
01:21:55,535 --> 01:21:57,298
- I think perhaps...
- # My...? #

860
01:21:57,470 --> 01:22:00,928
I think perhaps we'll leave the singing.

861
01:22:01,074 --> 01:22:04,134
Do you agree, until later, maybe?

862
01:22:08,281 --> 01:22:10,749
How is the restaurant?

863
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:15,150
- It's all right.
- And Richard? Mr. Boarst?

864
01:22:15,255 --> 01:22:17,485
He's fine.

865
01:22:19,092 --> 01:22:21,788
Is there any more trouble,

866
01:22:23,063 --> 01:22:25,258
er, like last night?

867
01:22:25,298 --> 01:22:27,994
- No, sir.
- Would you like to join us?

868
01:22:31,838 --> 01:22:35,433
No, thank you. I'll eat later with Mr. Boarst.

869
01:22:49,823 --> 01:22:51,848
Enjoy your meal.

870
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:53,949
Thank you.

871
01:22:58,798 --> 01:23:04,100
Erm, have you any other news to tell us?

872
01:23:05,305 --> 01:23:10,902
Mr. Boarst says... He told me to tell you to stay put

873
01:23:11,044 --> 01:23:14,639
and he wishes you bon appétit.

874
01:23:14,781 --> 01:23:16,646
Thank you.

875
01:23:24,491 --> 01:23:27,551
When you're finished, I'm to take the dishes back.

876
01:23:28,661 --> 01:23:34,190
Oh, if you find any of those books interesting,
you can borrow them.

877
01:24:06,766 --> 01:24:09,166
Wa-woo! Di-di-di-di-dah-da!

878
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:21,708
All right, where are they? Where are they?

879
01:24:22,649 --> 01:24:25,413
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

880
01:24:25,585 --> 01:24:30,249
I don't suppose you ate all this yourself.
What have we got in here? Let's see. Ah.

881
01:24:30,423 --> 01:24:34,723
Fish sauce with mayonnaise
and a touch of basil. I like basil.

882
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:37,261
What else we got in here? Aha.

883
01:24:37,397 --> 01:24:40,958
It's sticky. Don't tell me.
Chocolate sauce - profiteroles.

884
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,625
Georgina liked profiteroles.

885
01:24:44,771 --> 01:24:49,037
Oh, and serviettes
with Georgina's lipstick on them.

886
01:24:49,142 --> 01:24:51,940
And a nice bottle of wine. Very nice.

887
01:24:52,111 --> 01:24:55,171
He's for the chop, Richard.
I'll get my hands on him.

888
01:24:55,281 --> 01:24:59,718
Leave that bread roll alone. I need to know
where they are. Where are they? Eh?

889
01:24:59,852 --> 01:25:05,188
Ah. Ah. That's good.
Open your mouth. Come on, open it.

890
01:25:05,325 --> 01:25:08,988
- Take an interest in your food.
- We don't need to do this.

891
01:25:09,162 --> 01:25:12,529
- Getting squeamish?
- He's just a kid.

892
01:25:12,665 --> 01:25:16,658
- Stand him up and get his trousers down.
- Leave him alone.

893
01:25:16,769 --> 01:25:22,207
Get out. Who needs fairies like you?
And take your four-eyed cousin with you.

894
01:25:22,342 --> 01:25:27,803
See how you get on in the streets without
me to wipe your noses. Get lost! Righto.

895
01:25:27,947 --> 01:25:31,246
OK, button eater, tell me where they are.

896
01:25:35,188 --> 01:25:37,452
OK, button eater, where are they?

897
01:25:38,825 --> 01:25:43,057
We've run out of buttons.
But there is one more button.

898
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:46,663
It's your bellybutton.
How'd you like to swallow that?

899
01:25:46,799 --> 01:25:49,029
- Albert!
- You still here?

900
01:25:49,135 --> 01:25:51,899
Well, then, watch this.

901
01:26:00,313 --> 01:26:04,716
Wake him up! Wake him up, wake him up.
I must find out where she is!

902
01:26:04,851 --> 01:26:06,716
Wake him up!

903
01:26:07,887 --> 01:26:09,912
Wake him up!

904
01:26:10,990 --> 01:26:15,757
Where are they?
If he comes to, he better start to talk.

905
01:26:23,336 --> 01:26:25,861
I got 'em!

906
01:27:11,484 --> 01:27:13,679
I have brought your dinner.

907
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:24,694
Where's the kitchen lad?

908
01:27:24,831 --> 01:27:28,528
- He is in hospital.
- What?

909
01:27:32,105 --> 01:27:36,667
He said he told them nothing and I believe him.

910
01:27:36,809 --> 01:27:41,007
- I must see him.
- I don't think that's wise.

911
01:27:41,114 --> 01:27:42,877
I'm coming.

912
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:46,518
You must take me to him.

913
01:27:46,652 --> 01:27:49,985
- Start packing.
- What have we got to pack?

914
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:54,656
Richard. Richard, bring that for Pup.

915
01:27:54,761 --> 01:27:58,322
What can you do? You only endanger yourself.

916
01:27:59,932 --> 01:28:02,230
I'll only be gone an hour.

917
01:28:02,335 --> 01:28:05,031
Richard, you can bring me back, can't you?

918
01:28:07,607 --> 01:28:11,168
Oh, poor Pup. Oh, poor Pup.

919
01:28:18,851 --> 01:28:21,149
Leave me something to eat.

920
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:23,347
Of course.

921
01:28:25,992 --> 01:28:28,153
Please be very careful.

922
01:28:54,487 --> 01:29:01,359
# Have mercy upon me

923
01:29:02,929 --> 01:29:09,493
# Have mercy upon me

924
01:29:11,270 --> 01:29:17,834
# Blot out my transgressions

925
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:25,812
# Blot out my transgressions

926
01:29:27,053 --> 01:29:34,084
# Purge me with hyssop... #

927
01:29:36,596 --> 01:29:38,621
Thank you.

928
01:29:42,635 --> 01:29:48,767
# Wash me, wash me

929
01:29:49,876 --> 01:29:57,112
# And I shall be whiter than snow... #

930
01:30:05,658 --> 01:30:08,218
Hold him by his hair.

931
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:10,522
He hasn't got much hair to hold.

932
01:30:10,630 --> 01:30:14,225
- Disgusting to be that old and to be her lover.
- Same age as you.

933
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:19,030
- I'm her husband, not her lover.
- You can only be one and not the other?

934
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:25,769
If he'd been younger, I could've understood.
He'd just be a passing fancy. You bastard!

935
01:30:25,912 --> 01:30:30,008
Right, Mitchel, now's your chance.
You are gonna chew bollocks.

936
01:30:30,116 --> 01:30:32,744
- He's too old.
- What's that mean?

937
01:30:32,919 --> 01:30:35,581
He's the same age as me - 40, almost.

938
01:30:35,755 --> 01:30:38,747
If he was younger it would've been all right?

939
01:30:38,858 --> 01:30:42,954
My God. When you're 17, is being 40 old?

940
01:30:43,062 --> 01:30:49,900
- He probably hasn't had a bath recently.
- God, Mitchel, you are a prize mule.

941
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:53,562
Well, I mean, certainly...

942
01:30:53,639 --> 01:30:57,405
- He must've been with Georgina last night.
- No! Shut up.

943
01:30:57,577 --> 01:31:00,171
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!

944
01:31:00,346 --> 01:31:02,678
You pissing little worm.

945
01:31:04,684 --> 01:31:06,879
God, you are an idiot, Mitchel.

946
01:31:06,986 --> 01:31:11,286
You can be guaranteed
to say the wrong thing at the right time.

947
01:31:11,390 --> 01:31:15,793
I didn't mean that you literally
had to chew his bollocks off.

948
01:31:15,928 --> 01:31:18,726
I meant it metaphorically.

949
01:31:18,898 --> 01:31:21,025
What does that mean, Albert?

950
01:31:21,133 --> 01:31:24,534
"Jewish Book-keeper Savaged
By Young Sex Maniac."

951
01:31:24,670 --> 01:31:28,231
I don't want this to look like a sex murder.

952
01:31:28,374 --> 01:31:33,607
It's a revenge killing, an affair of the heart,
a crime passionnel.

953
01:31:33,713 --> 01:31:37,240
I want no evil gossip spread around about me.

954
01:31:37,383 --> 01:31:42,980
They are not going to say... They are going
to say this was a dignified revenge killing.

955
01:31:43,122 --> 01:31:45,189
They're gonna admire the style.

956
01:31:45,224 --> 01:31:49,354
"He was stuffed. And Albert liked good food."

957
01:31:49,562 --> 01:31:53,965
They might even smile.
"He was stuffed with the tools of his trade."

958
01:31:54,867 --> 01:31:59,895
"He was stuffed with books.
The crummy little book-keeper was..."

959
01:32:00,006 --> 01:32:04,773
Mitchel, no unnecessary... No unnecessaries.

960
01:32:05,945 --> 01:32:11,247
Finish him off! Shut his mouth, hold his nose,
ram the bloody books down his throat.

961
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:13,784
Suffocate the bastard!

962
01:32:21,027 --> 01:32:23,188
Michael!

963
01:32:33,172 --> 01:32:34,639
Michael.

964
01:32:57,863 --> 01:33:02,493
OK, so this is how you eat the crayfish.
First, you snap off the head.

965
01:33:03,936 --> 01:33:06,029
Then you pull out the whiskers,

966
01:33:06,138 --> 01:33:08,436
then you strip off the legs.

967
01:33:10,242 --> 01:33:17,341
And then you poke out the soft part of the body.

968
01:33:17,450 --> 01:33:21,011
- You turn the light out?
- What light?

969
01:33:22,154 --> 01:33:26,557
Idiot. You wouldn't remember to fart.
Place might burn down with all them books.

970
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:31,288
- That would nicely destroy the evidence.
- I don't want it destroyed, idiot!

971
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:33,193
I want Georgina to see it.

972
01:34:36,028 --> 01:34:38,121
What did he say?

973
01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:42,428
The French Revolution
was easier to swallow than Napoleon.

974
01:34:42,535 --> 01:34:46,198
Napoleon was a prat. He threw everything away.

975
01:34:46,372 --> 01:34:51,708
Napoleon liked seafood.
His favorite dish was oysters Florentine.

976
01:34:51,844 --> 01:34:54,877
It's amazing, isn't it? Churchill liked seafood.

977
01:34:54,912 --> 01:34:57,911
All the great generals were keen on seafood.

978
01:34:59,251 --> 01:35:02,277
What did Julius Caesar like, or Hitler?

979
01:35:02,388 --> 01:35:05,721
Hitler liked clams. And Mussolini liked squid.

980
01:35:05,858 --> 01:35:08,588
- You're making it up.
- What do you know, Harris?

981
01:35:08,828 --> 01:35:12,127
- What did the bookseller eat?
- You could tell from his vomit.

982
01:35:12,264 --> 01:35:16,530
What do I care what he ate?
It all comes out as shit in the end.

983
01:35:36,856 --> 01:35:38,881
I'm so tired.

984
01:35:41,961 --> 01:35:44,088
I'm going to sleep.

985
01:35:59,044 --> 01:36:01,911
I've got a lot to tell you in the morning.

986
01:36:03,115 --> 01:36:05,310
And I want you to listen.

987
01:36:07,453 --> 01:36:10,945
Somebody should know.
And who can I tell but you?

988
01:36:15,394 --> 01:36:17,259
And then...

989
01:36:22,201 --> 01:36:24,499
when I wake up in the morning,

990
01:36:28,807 --> 01:36:31,071
I want you to kiss me.

991
01:36:35,481 --> 01:36:37,779
And then I want breakfast.

992
01:36:38,951 --> 01:36:42,580
Erm, coffee and fresh rolls and butter

993
01:36:45,224 --> 01:36:47,283
and marmalade.

994
01:36:48,394 --> 01:36:51,591
And toast.

995
01:36:52,765 --> 01:36:54,926
And...

996
01:36:57,002 --> 01:36:59,129
Good night, Michael.

997
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:06,842
I'll see you in the morning.

998
01:37:11,317 --> 01:37:13,410
I love you.

999
01:37:15,187 --> 01:37:18,486
- You shouldn't have done it. It wasn't worth it.
- You what?

1000
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:22,959
Georgina wasn't worth it?
How bloody dare you say that?

1001
01:37:23,095 --> 01:37:27,725
Georgina's worth a thousand
snooty little Jewish book-keeping clerks

1002
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:30,926
who masturbate over the French Revolution.

1003
01:37:31,036 --> 01:37:36,269
The book-keeper will get us into trouble
and he wasn't worth it. Calm down.

1004
01:37:36,375 --> 01:37:41,745
Little circumcised mediocrity
was screwing my wife! I will not calm down!

1005
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:46,146
I've seen you, Harris, eyeing Georgina,
looking at another man's wife.

1006
01:37:46,251 --> 01:37:50,017
I've seen you watch her skirt fly up
when she got out of the car.

1007
01:37:50,189 --> 01:37:52,657
Yes, I've seen you sniffing her, Harris.

1008
01:37:52,791 --> 01:37:55,988
And to think I ever trusted you with her,

1009
01:37:57,096 --> 01:38:00,395
that I ever trusted you to drive her home
when I was drunk.

1010
01:38:00,499 --> 01:38:03,400
- You get out of this restaurant!
- Calm down.

1011
01:38:03,569 --> 01:38:07,164
Mitchel, get Richard.
I want this man banned. Get out!

1012
01:38:07,306 --> 01:38:10,798
- If you want to shout...
- I can shout in my own restaurant!

1013
01:38:10,943 --> 01:38:14,777
I own this restaurant. Get out! Fuck you!

1014
01:38:16,882 --> 01:38:20,750
Go, you mule! Richard, I'm closing you up.

1015
01:38:20,919 --> 01:38:24,719
- Really?
- You are finished, Richard.

1016
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:30,226
Allowing decent people to dine
with wife snatchers. You're finished!

1017
01:38:30,362 --> 01:38:32,523
I think not, Mr. Spica!

1018
01:38:32,631 --> 01:38:38,092
And if I did, where would you eat?
Who would have you?

1019
01:38:38,237 --> 01:38:43,402
Now, if you'd kindly leave,
we can start clearing up the mess you have made.

1020
01:38:43,509 --> 01:38:48,572
I'm warning you. Tomorrow
your restaurant will be just one big car park.

1021
01:38:48,680 --> 01:38:51,171
- Nothing more.
- I wonder how you will do that.

1022
01:38:51,316 --> 01:38:56,488
A bulldozer, Richard.
Your cuisine will be 20 feet under brick dust.

1023
01:38:56,523 --> 01:38:59,855
Get out of it, Harris. You get out of it.

1024
01:39:00,092 --> 01:39:03,994
Go on. I can tell loyalty when I see it.

1025
01:39:29,021 --> 01:39:31,251
Well, Michael,

1026
01:39:33,492 --> 01:39:35,653
you didn't kiss me

1027
01:39:37,896 --> 01:39:39,921
so...

1028
01:39:42,601 --> 01:39:45,399
I suppose I have to make my own breakfast.

1029
01:39:48,707 --> 01:39:50,868
Don't get up yet.

1030
01:40:07,259 --> 01:40:09,352
Well, Michael,

1031
01:40:12,431 --> 01:40:14,490
that's that.

1032
01:40:15,901 --> 01:40:19,337
Short and very sweet.

1033
01:40:22,574 --> 01:40:26,908
Now you're not listening,
I suppose I could tell you about Albert.

1034
01:40:27,946 --> 01:40:32,974
I meant to tell you eventually
but I'd have to know you better because...

1035
01:40:33,218 --> 01:40:35,709
Well, because I'd be so ashamed.

1036
01:40:38,590 --> 01:40:43,050
But it's important that I tell you now
so that I can have done with it.

1037
01:40:49,434 --> 01:40:54,929
Albert beat me. Well, I know you know that.
You saw the bruises.

1038
01:40:56,308 --> 01:40:58,572
He was regular in his habits.

1039
01:41:04,016 --> 01:41:07,611
When we got back from that restaurant,
he'd make me get a hot, wet towel

1040
01:41:07,786 --> 01:41:10,016
and accompany him to the toilet.

1041
01:41:12,324 --> 01:41:14,554
And I'd have to wipe his...

1042
01:41:18,697 --> 01:41:21,825
After I finished, he... he made... Oh...

1043
01:41:26,672 --> 01:41:28,537
Help me, Michael.

1044
01:41:32,311 --> 01:41:37,180
On his side of the bed he had
a suitcase with all kinds of objects in it.

1045
01:41:37,349 --> 01:41:39,544
Er, a toothbrush,

1046
01:41:41,453 --> 01:41:43,580
a wooden spoon,

1047
01:41:47,125 --> 01:41:49,320
a plastic train,

1048
01:41:50,696 --> 01:41:52,721
a wine bottle.

1049
01:41:52,831 --> 01:41:54,992
And he'd use them.

1050
01:41:56,768 --> 01:42:01,398
If I didn't do it whilst he watched,
he'd insist on doing it himself.

1051
01:42:03,242 --> 01:42:06,268
At least when I did it, it hurt less.

1052
01:42:08,814 --> 01:42:13,717
I don't think he was very interested in sex -
not with me, not with women.

1053
01:42:18,056 --> 01:42:20,217
I left him four times.

1054
01:42:22,194 --> 01:42:24,389
I caught the night ferry.

1055
01:42:26,898 --> 01:42:30,925
He and Harris found me in Brussels,
they brought me back.

1056
01:42:32,371 --> 01:42:35,534
On the boat, Albert cried, bought me presents.

1057
01:42:37,743 --> 01:42:42,407
But then after we landed,
when we gotjust outside the harbor,

1058
01:42:42,581 --> 01:42:45,311
before the motorway, he stopped the car

1059
01:42:45,384 --> 01:42:50,378
and he and Harris and Spangler dragged me out
and stripped me and beat me.

1060
01:42:56,928 --> 01:42:58,793
'Michael,

1061
01:43:01,166 --> 01:43:03,361
'all this must finish.

1062
01:43:05,504 --> 01:43:08,530
'Help me, Michael. Please.'

1063
01:43:16,014 --> 01:43:18,141
He's dead.

1064
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:25,884
They stuffed his mouth with paper
ripped from his favorite book.

1065
01:43:25,991 --> 01:43:29,017
- Could you cook him?
- Cook who, Georgina?

1066
01:43:30,529 --> 01:43:32,520
Michael.

1067
01:43:32,631 --> 01:43:35,293
No. Mon dieu, non.

1068
01:43:38,236 --> 01:43:43,230
You have a reputation
for a wide range of experimental dishes.

1069
01:43:45,677 --> 01:43:48,111
He might taste good.

1070
01:43:48,246 --> 01:43:50,476
I'm sure he would taste good.

1071
01:43:50,582 --> 01:43:52,982
What would taste best?

1072
01:43:53,118 --> 01:43:56,349
His heart? His liver?

1073
01:43:56,455 --> 01:43:59,117
The cheeks of his backside?

1074
01:43:59,291 --> 01:44:02,658
His prairie oysters?

1075
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:07,457
Georgina,

1076
01:44:07,566 --> 01:44:09,625
sit down.

1077
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:13,201
Sit down.

1078
01:44:16,007 --> 01:44:19,465
When you make out a menu,
how do you price each dish?

1079
01:44:22,314 --> 01:44:25,981
I charge a lot for anything black.

1080
01:44:26,016 --> 01:44:29,649
Grapes, olives, blackcurrants.

1081
01:44:32,758 --> 01:44:35,591
People like to remind themselves of death,

1082
01:44:36,661 --> 01:44:40,495
eating black food is like consuming death,

1083
01:44:41,633 --> 01:44:48,368
like saying, "Death, I'm eating you."

1084
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:52,738
Black truffles are the most expensive. And caviar.

1085
01:44:54,679 --> 01:44:57,079
Death and birth.

1086
01:44:58,417 --> 01:45:01,181
The end and the beginning.

1087
01:45:02,587 --> 01:45:07,752
Don't you think it's appropriate
that the most expensive items are black?

1088
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:13,928
We also charge for vanity.

1089
01:45:15,033 --> 01:45:18,025
Diet foods have an additional surcharge

1090
01:45:19,471 --> 01:45:21,666
of 30%.

1091
01:45:22,774 --> 01:45:25,607
Aphrodisiacs, 50%.

1092
01:45:25,644 --> 01:45:30,513
And from what I saw,
your lover did not need an aphrodisiac.

1093
01:45:31,850 --> 01:45:35,616
What did you see? I want to know.

1094
01:45:36,855 --> 01:45:38,720
Nobody knew but you.

1095
01:45:39,891 --> 01:45:42,325
Everyone pitied me. Even you pitied me.

1096
01:45:43,462 --> 01:45:47,364
And how can I know that he loved me
if there were no witnesses?

1097
01:45:48,767 --> 01:45:53,932
If you loved him, that does not seem
to be a very necessary question.

1098
01:45:54,039 --> 01:45:57,133
Yes, it does! Tell me what you know!

1099
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:03,312
What I saw was what you let me see.

1100
01:46:05,984 --> 01:46:08,009
Of course it was.

1101
01:46:08,987 --> 01:46:13,549
How could I know that it was real
unless someone else was watching?

1102
01:46:15,961 --> 01:46:18,088
Tell me what you saw.

1103
01:46:19,197 --> 01:46:21,495
Or are you ashamed to tell me?

1104
01:46:25,337 --> 01:46:27,532
No.

1105
01:46:27,639 --> 01:46:29,971
I saw him kissing you

1106
01:46:32,177 --> 01:46:34,236
on the mouth,

1107
01:46:36,448 --> 01:46:38,279
on the neck,

1108
01:46:39,451 --> 01:46:41,544
behind your ear.

1109
01:46:45,357 --> 01:46:47,723
I saw him undressing you.

1110
01:46:52,397 --> 01:46:54,661
I saw him kissing your breasts.

1111
01:46:58,637 --> 01:47:02,368
I saw him put his hand between your legs.

1112
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:07,208
And what did you see me do?

1113
01:47:10,982 --> 01:47:13,143
I saw you kiss him on the mouth.

1114
01:47:17,422 --> 01:47:21,791
I saw you lying under him on the floor of the pantry.

1115
01:47:25,397 --> 01:47:28,628
I saw him take you from behind.

1116
01:47:33,572 --> 01:47:37,099
I saw you take his penis in your mouth.

1117
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:42,744
I saw you...

1118
01:47:59,864 --> 01:48:02,424
Do lovers always behave like that?

1119
01:48:07,372 --> 01:48:10,466
My parents behaved like that.

1120
01:48:10,675 --> 01:48:12,666
They did?

1121
01:48:12,777 --> 01:48:17,237
- You saw them?
- And lovers in the cinema behave like that.

1122
01:48:17,382 --> 01:48:19,475
No, that doesn't count.

1123
01:48:19,618 --> 01:48:24,453
And in my fantasies,
lovers always behave like that.

1124
01:48:24,623 --> 01:48:26,318
Were you jealous?

1125
01:48:27,492 --> 01:48:29,687
Did we make you jealous?

1126
01:48:30,996 --> 01:48:33,157
Did you want to join us?

1127
01:48:34,332 --> 01:48:37,859
- If you did, help me now.
- Georgina, no.

1128
01:48:38,003 --> 01:48:43,305
In memory of us making love in your kitchen
and in your fantasies, help me now.

1129
01:48:43,441 --> 01:48:45,170
No.

1130
01:48:46,344 --> 01:48:50,337
In memory of your parents making love,
help me now.

1131
01:48:50,448 --> 01:48:52,473
Georgina, no!

1132
01:48:53,418 --> 01:48:56,114
People I like learn my name too late.

1133
01:48:57,555 --> 01:48:59,785
Too late?

1134
01:49:01,026 --> 01:49:03,324
Cook Michael for me.

1135
01:49:03,428 --> 01:49:05,293
No.

1136
01:49:06,464 --> 01:49:08,955
This was his favorite restaurant.

1137
01:49:10,101 --> 01:49:12,126
It's also mine.

1138
01:49:13,238 --> 01:49:15,399
Cook Michael for me.

1139
01:49:16,908 --> 01:49:18,705
If I did,

1140
01:49:19,878 --> 01:49:22,870
who would ever eat here again?

1141
01:49:27,018 --> 01:49:29,350
How can I make you change your mind?

1142
01:49:32,991 --> 01:49:36,586
Do you want to make love with me?
You can do what he did.

1143
01:49:40,331 --> 01:49:42,162
How can I persuade you?

1144
01:49:43,501 --> 01:49:45,833
You can't. You may have loved him...

1145
01:49:45,970 --> 01:49:48,495
You know I did, you saw me.

1146
01:49:50,141 --> 01:49:53,167
But you don't have to eat him, Georgina.

1147
01:49:53,278 --> 01:49:57,942
Do you... Do you have some idea
that by eating him

1148
01:49:58,116 --> 01:50:00,550
he can become part of you?

1149
01:50:00,585 --> 01:50:04,885
You can't believe that by eating him
you can always be together!

1150
01:50:06,491 --> 01:50:08,356
I'm not eating him.

1151
01:50:11,429 --> 01:50:14,330
- Albert is.
- Albert?

1152
01:50:19,237 --> 01:50:21,705
There's £11,000. It's Michael's.

1153
01:50:29,314 --> 01:50:31,544
Put your money away.

1154
01:50:38,356 --> 01:50:40,517
Where is he?

1155
01:52:26,264 --> 01:52:28,425
What's going on here?

1156
01:52:28,533 --> 01:52:32,697
Why do I suddenly have to come in
to my own restaurant like a stranger?

1157
01:52:32,804 --> 01:52:34,931
Special invitations.

1158
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:39,373
Which I might say
could've gone to a better printer.

1159
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:42,172
I have to bang on the door like an outcast.

1160
01:52:44,048 --> 01:52:46,039
Well, well, well.

1161
01:52:46,150 --> 01:52:51,247
Georgina Duckles.
What brings you here, you bitch?

1162
01:52:52,156 --> 01:52:55,751
I'm very surprised
you show your face here, you slut.

1163
01:52:55,894 --> 01:52:59,660
Where you been, Georgina?
Albert has been frantic.

1164
01:52:59,831 --> 01:53:02,391
Shut up, Grace. Find me a drink.

1165
01:53:02,533 --> 01:53:06,731
- Happy anniversary, Albert.
- I'll bloody kill you for what you did!

1166
01:53:06,838 --> 01:53:10,433
- You should find that easy.
- Don't think I'm taking you back.

1167
01:53:10,575 --> 01:53:12,702
I'll make you pay, you slut.

1168
01:53:12,810 --> 01:53:16,405
Your bottom's going to be
very, very sore for weeks.

1169
01:53:17,548 --> 01:53:21,848
No more books for you, girl.
You're staying in under lock and key.

1170
01:53:21,953 --> 01:53:26,583
There's going to be no more books
or prick-sniffing for you, girl.

1171
01:53:28,126 --> 01:53:30,492
Happy anniversary, Albert.

1172
01:53:30,628 --> 01:53:34,359
What are you talking about? It's not my birthday.

1173
01:53:34,532 --> 01:53:41,096
No, but it's an anniversary that I shall
always celebrate, even if you won't. And you won't.

1174
01:53:41,239 --> 01:53:45,938
- What? Where is everybody?
- They'll be here presently.

1175
01:53:46,110 --> 01:53:48,738
- Look, Georgina.
- What?

1176
01:53:48,947 --> 01:53:52,474
- It's all over now.
- What is?

1177
01:53:52,617 --> 01:53:55,916
- Grace, just go and look out of a window.
- Oh.

1178
01:53:56,054 --> 01:53:58,420
Mitchel, bugger off out of it.

1179
01:53:58,556 --> 01:54:01,650
Look, Georgina, when the others arrive...

1180
01:54:01,759 --> 01:54:04,819
Where are they? The invitation says nine o'clock.

1181
01:54:04,963 --> 01:54:08,490
- Where are they gonna sit?
- They'll be here presently.

1182
01:54:08,633 --> 01:54:12,626
Look, Georgina, you didn't...
didn't really like him, did you?

1183
01:54:12,737 --> 01:54:17,936
I mean, how could you like
a bloody book-keeper, a nobody?

1184
01:54:19,010 --> 01:54:24,448
I tell you what. I'll try... We'll forget it, eh?

1185
01:54:24,582 --> 01:54:27,176
Eh? Come home with me.

1186
01:54:27,352 --> 01:54:31,686
Tell you the truth, Georgie,
I've been a bit miserable.

1187
01:54:31,823 --> 01:54:35,919
- Since it is your anniversary...
- What bloody anniversary?

1188
01:54:36,027 --> 01:54:38,052
I've brought you a present.

1189
01:54:38,162 --> 01:54:41,757
I don't need presents.
It's me who gives you presents.

1190
01:54:41,833 --> 01:54:45,530
Besides, you've never had
the money to give me presents.

1191
01:54:45,803 --> 01:54:48,101
And Richard has cooked it for you.

1192
01:54:49,207 --> 01:54:51,903
- Under my instructions.
- Oh?

1193
01:54:52,076 --> 01:54:54,067
Knowing how you like to eat.

1194
01:54:55,179 --> 01:54:57,807
Knowing how you like to gorge yourself.

1195
01:54:59,117 --> 01:55:02,314
And we've brought a few of your friends around.

1196
01:56:08,753 --> 01:56:11,483
What sort of party is this, Georgie?

1197
01:56:13,257 --> 01:56:16,715
- What's going on?
- Sit down, Albert.

1198
01:56:17,862 --> 01:56:20,057
Can't I sit down, Georgina?

1199
01:56:20,164 --> 01:56:22,564
No, this is Albert's special treat.

1200
01:56:24,735 --> 01:56:30,002
- Here, I'm not eating with that Roy there.
- Shut up, Albert.

1201
01:56:32,610 --> 01:56:34,976
You're here to enjoy yourself.

1202
01:56:46,023 --> 01:56:48,014
Georgie.

1203
01:57:04,509 --> 01:57:06,739
Jesus!

1204
01:57:06,844 --> 01:57:08,311
God.

1205
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:16,011
No, it's not God, Albert. It's Michael.

1206
01:57:17,788 --> 01:57:19,653
My lover.

1207
01:57:20,825 --> 01:57:23,851
You vowed you would kill him, and you did.

1208
01:57:25,930 --> 01:57:28,228
And you vowed you would eat him.

1209
01:57:30,001 --> 01:57:31,866
Now eat him.

1210
01:57:34,205 --> 01:57:36,332
What's the matter?

1211
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:40,171
You have your knife and fork.
You do know how to use them.

1212
01:57:40,344 --> 01:57:44,644
Or have all those carefully-learnt table manners
gone to waste?

1213
01:57:55,826 --> 01:57:58,420
Mitchel can pour you a drink.

1214
01:58:05,903 --> 01:58:08,531
Your waiter has opted out.

1215
01:58:08,706 --> 01:58:10,571
Er, Grace will pour for you.

1216
01:58:11,742 --> 01:58:13,733
Oh.

1217
01:58:16,948 --> 01:58:19,246
- Non, monsieur!
- Yah!

1218
01:58:37,735 --> 01:58:40,203
Eat, Albert.

1219
01:58:41,639 --> 01:58:43,937
Roy, pour Albert a drink.
