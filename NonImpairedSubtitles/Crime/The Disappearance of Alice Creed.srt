1
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,070
Okay.

2
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:34,570
Help me. Help me. Let me go.

3
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,270
Help me.

4
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,670
Well? Did you send it?

5
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,770
Did you send the e-mail?

6
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,170
Pictures.

7
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,370
Yes. I sent them.

8
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,270
I sent them.

9
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,570
We need to keep you high,
Drakie. Understand?

10
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,170
Please nod if you understand.

11
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,370
Now, for you to drink,
I need to take off the gag.

12
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,670
Please ... do not scream.

13
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,670
We do not want to hurt you.

14
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,170
And we certainly don't
wanna kill you.

15
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,570
Now we are absolutely prepared to
do either or both of these things ...

16
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,470
if we need to. Do you understand?
- Yes.

17
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,070
Please don't hurt me.

18
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,470
Please, please let me go.

19
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,870
- I have a daughter and she needs me.
- Shh ...

20
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,370
Please?

21
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,370
We know you don't have a daughter.

22
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,870
We know everything about you.

23
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,670
Now I'm sure it's
a natural response.

24
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,970
You're trying to reason with us ...
you're just ...

25
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,070
Now you listen to me!

26
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,970
The only people that can get you
out of here are him and me.

27
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,070
We are your only friends.

28
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,070
I owe it to you to do as we say.

29
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,170
Now, are you gonna be quiet
and drink from the bottle?

30
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,770
Good.

31
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,470
Whenever you need the bathroom, wait
till we come in and give us this signal.

32
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,070
Try to hold it in,

33
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,470
because we won't be changing
your sheets or your clothes.

34
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,870
Do you understand?

35
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,270
Good.

36
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,170
- We should keep a clear head!
- Need a drink.

37
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,670
Just one.

38
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,270
Make sure it's not your breath in there.

39
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,570
Make sure she can't smell any on you.

40
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,470
Why?

41
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,670
Because we are not a bunch
of fucking amateurs.

42
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,270
Okay. I'll chew some gum after.

43
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,070
You should eat.
Keep your energy up.

44
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,970
I'm not hungry.

45
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,770
I do not care. Eat.

46
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,270
- I said eat!
- I don't want to.

47
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,770
What?

48
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,970
Eat!

49
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,370
Eat it!

50
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,570
I said I'm not hungry.

51
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,670
Fuck! Shit!

52
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,970
That far I told you
I'm not hungry.

53
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,970
You haven't eaten for nine hours,
you've been doing physical work ...

54
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,870
and you're still not hungry?
- No. No.

55
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,270
If you are not hungry, it means
that something is not right.

56
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,470
Maybe you're thinking too much.

57
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,270
About whether we have done
everything right,

58
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,570
or whether we have made a mistake
on the way that will get us caught?

59
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,570
That can get us 20 years in jail.

60
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,770
Or maybe you think about whether
we had to rough up that girl?

61
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,670
Or perhaps even kill her?

62
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,670
Or worse ...

63
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,470
Maybe you are getting senti-fuckin'-mental.
Now this girl isn't just theoretical?!

64
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,570
Now, you've looked into her eyes.

65
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,570
Maybe you're having second thoughts?!

66
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,870
Maybe your conscience is eating
away at your conviction?!

67
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,270
And maybe you are persuading yourself ...

68
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:35,070
the best thing to do is just go in
there, untie her, and let her go?!

69
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,270
Would you listen to me?

70
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,370
Fuck that!

71
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:42,870
You understand?

72
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,670
Look at me.

73
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,070
Look at me!

74
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,470
Fuck that!!

75
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:54,170
We are in this. We are too far
along to get fucking squeamish.

76
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,170
Now, any doubts that you
have, are just bullshit.

77
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,170
They are just major bullshit,
and you know it.

78
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,570
You know it. You know you know it.

79
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,270
So you say it.

80
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,070
Say what?

81
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,470
Fuck that!!

82
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,170
- Fuck that.
- Again.

83
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,970
Fuck that!

84
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,770
Now don't think.

85
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,570
Eat.

86
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,670
We got a long night ahead.

87
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,270
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

88
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,370
We should check on her
before I leave.

89
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,770
Well?

90
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,470
How come I always have to do
the fucking dogwork?

91
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,870
Because that's your role.

92
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,570
Now go and check on her.

93
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,870
Bathroom alert.

94
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,670
Do you need a number one,
or a number two?

95
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,570
Show me with your fingers.

96
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,670
Ready?

97
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,870
Done?

98
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,470
- You're going already?
- Yeah.

99
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,470
It's time.

100
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,770
Be careful.

101
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,670
Remember to dump the phone.

102
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,870
I'm not stupid.

103
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,770
Just reminding.

104
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:56,070
Don't sleep, check on her,
and don't drink.

105
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,470
Sure. Whatever.

106
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,970
No? Not whatever. You just do it.

107
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,570
You keep your head
in the fucking game.

108
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,970
Do you understand?

109
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,670
Yup.

110
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,770
Fuckin' dick.

111
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,070
What happened?

112
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,170
- Did you make the call?
- Yeah.

113
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,270
I made it.

114
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,870
So how did it go?

115
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,970
- It went fine.
- So he is going to pay?

116
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,870
- He said yes, but?
- But what?

117
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,370
There was a click.

118
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,370
The police were there.
They were listening in.

119
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,070
Police?

120
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,470
Ok. We knew this would
happen eventually.

121
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,770
Yeah, but not so fucking soon.

122
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,970
We planned this. That's why
we dumped the phone.

123
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,470
We planned for this, so calm down.

124
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,970
So what did he say?

125
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,570
He said he wanted to speak
to his daughter,

126
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,170
and make sure she was still alive.

127
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,770
And?

128
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,770
And I said no. He was just playing for
time so they could trace the call.

129
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,770
Trace? Fuck me!

130
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,470
Calm!

131
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:17,270
- We're okay.
- But he agreed?

132
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,670
He agreed to the money,
to the timing?

133
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,770
Yes. He said he'd get the money
first thing in the morning.

134
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,170
No sequential notes,
no traces, no paybonds.

135
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,670
Good.

136
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,670
I want to be sure.

137
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,670
We need to make sure he goes to
that bank as soon as it opens,

138
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,270
and gets that money as fast
as he fucking can.

139
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,870
We need you to do something.

140
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,670
He is going to untie you.
When he does,

141
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:52,570
you're gonna to sit on the edge of
the bed, and stay very very still.

142
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,670
Understand?

143
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,770
You are going to look into this
camera, and speak to your father.

144
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,470
Tell him, that he must pay the money.

145
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,970
He must do exactly as we ask,
or we will kill you.

146
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,470
You tell him that you have no
doubts that we will kill you.

147
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,970
Understand?

148
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,670
Yes.

149
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,970
Good.

150
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,670
Take: 1.

151
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:50,870
Daddy ...

152
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,470
I'm okay.

153
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,870
They just took me ...

154
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,370
I was leaving the house,
and they just took me.

155
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,070
I do not know where I am.

156
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:06,870
Stop!

157
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,770
I don't want a narrative. I just
want you to look into the camera ...

158
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,170
and tell him that unless he pays
the money, we will kill you.

159
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:18,470
Any deviation from our
instructions, we will kill you.

160
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,370
Any piss, we will kill you!

161
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,270
Understand?

162
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:26,670
Yes.

163
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,570
No. She is not scared enough.

164
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,370
Give her some motivation.

165
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,970
That's better.

166
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:46,170
Now, get yourself together
and try again.

167
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,670
Daddy ...

168
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,670
I love you.

169
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,270
Please ...

170
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,270
Pay.

171
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,470
Pay them the money.

172
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:13,170
Just do exactly as they say,
or they will kill me.

173
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:16,170
Daddy, they will kill me
if you don't.

174
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,870
Please, Daddy.

175
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,970
Just do exactly as they say, please.

176
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,970
Just pay them the money.

177
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,570
I want to come home.

178
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,570
Just give them the money, please.

179
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,570
Thank you.

180
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,670
No, no, please. I won't cry.

181
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,570
My arms hurt.

182
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,570
Uncuff her.

183
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,970
Move them around a bit.

184
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,670
Go on.

185
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,270
Better?

186
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,870
A little.

187
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,570
Tie her up.

188
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,170
Please Daddy.

189
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,370
They just pay them the money.
I want to come home.

190
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,570
Just give them the money, please.

191
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,470
This is good.

192
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,270
This'll work.

193
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,870
- She did well.
- She did.

194
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,870
She was a good choice.

195
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,770
She was a good find, then.

196
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,470
Don't fall asleep.

197
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,370
These will keep you awake.

198
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,570
Keep an eye on her.

199
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,270
She's worth a lot of money to us.

200
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:09,970
I know.

201
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,570
Take care.

202
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,070
No.

203
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,970
No.

204
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,870
Get this off.

205
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,570
I can't.

206
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,770
I can't go with you watching me.

207
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:58,570
Could you just leave me alone
for a few minutes, please?

208
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,370
I can't shit with you
staring at me, just ...

209
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,670
Please.

210
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:06,470
I can't do it with you
standing there and looking at me.

211
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,370
Let me go! Let me go!

212
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,370
Give me the fucking keys
and cut the machine!

213
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,070
I'll kill you when I get the keys
from you ... bloody ...

214
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,270
It's Danny. It's Danny.

215
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,970
It's me, Danny.

216
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,270
What?

217
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,570
It's me, Alice.

218
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,670
- It's me.
- Danny.

219
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,370
- What the fuck are you doing.
- Put the gun down.

220
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,470
- The gun Alice, the gun.
- Was it you? Was it you?

221
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,370
- There is a plan.
- A plan? Fuck!

222
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,470
- Danny ¦- Just put the fucking gun
down before you kill me, Alice.

223
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:25,670
Just get me the fuck out of here.
Unlock me right fucking now.

224
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,970
Hold on, alright, okay.
Just listen to me first.

225
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,870
- We're getting some money
from your dad. ¦- What?

226
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,670
A lot of money.

227
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,070
You always sayin' how much
you hate your dad.

228
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,570
What the fuck are you talking about?

229
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,870
You hate him Alice, he cut you off.

230
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,870
He's got all that fucking money,
and he's never gonna get ...

231
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,570
You've always talked about a way
of getting his money off him.

232
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,970
This is it, Alice.

233
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,570
This is how.

234
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,470
This is how we can get his money.

235
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,070
But, you've fucking kidnapped me.

236
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,170
Yes. I kidnapped you for us.

237
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,870
- The money is for us. It's all for us.
- What?

238
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,270
Look, this is a good thing, Alice.

239
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,670
Good?

240
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,270
You've fucking kidnapped me.

241
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:05,170
You've fucking stripped me naked, you
made me piss in a fucking bottle ...

242
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,170
in front of ... Who?

243
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,670
Who the fuck is the other man?
Do I know him too?

244
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,770
No no. It's Victor. It's Vic.

245
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,670
He's no one. He's no one.

246
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,170
I met him on the other side of ...

247
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:15,970
About what?

248
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,970
About us.

249
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:20,770
He thinks you're just a random rich
girl. He doesn't know, you betcha.

250
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,470
He thinks all this is his plan.

251
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,770
He doesn't suspect that we're
gonna take all the money.

252
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,370
All of it, me and you.

253
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,170
You've fucking kidnapped me, so
I can get some of my dad's money.

254
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,770
Uh? Yeah.

255
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:40,470
Then why the fuck
didn't you ask me first?

256
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,770
I thought I was gonna fucking die,
here. I was fucking terrified.

257
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,970
I know, I know. I am sorry, right.

258
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:48,970
But it had to look real.
Feel real? for Vic.

259
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,970
For you.

260
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,470
Look real?

261
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,870
Can't fucking do that
to somebody, Danny.

262
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,370
You can't make them think
they're gonna fucking die.

263
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,970
You can't fake it, Alice,

264
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,370
not properly.

265
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,470
He would have seen if you're
pretending. He would have known.

266
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,670
You told me you loved me.

267
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:11,170
You told me that you loved me.

268
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,670
I do, baby.

269
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:17,570
That's why? That's why I did this,
because I love you.

270
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,470
I was gonna tell the
truth out? I was?

271
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,870
What would you have said?

272
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,670
Sorry I fucking kidnapped you. Sorry,
I've totally fucking humiliated you.

273
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,370
But we will be rich, Alice.

274
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,270
Rich!

275
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,970
How much?

276
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,770
How much am I worth?

277
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,170
Two million.

278
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:36,970
And he is gonna pay ...
2 million, cash.

279
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,370
Untraceable.

280
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,270
All you have to do
is lie in that bed.

281
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,870
Tied down ...

282
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,970
humiliated, abused.

283
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,570
It will only be for
another day or so.

284
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,370
Not too much to ask for 2 million?

285
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,670
For a whole new life.

286
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,670
Alice ...

287
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,270
I love you, truly.

288
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,470
So, can I have my gun back?

289
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,870
Alice, please.

290
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,870
Just do this.

291
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,570
Fuck!

292
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,070
It's him. He's back. He's back.

293
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,570
You have to give me the gun.

294
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,970
If I do not answer the door,
he'll kick it in.

295
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,370
If he comes in here
and sees us like this ...

296
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,170
he'll go fucking crazy.

297
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,170
He'll fucking kill us both.

298
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,370
You won't escape, Alice.

299
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,570
He'll kill ye.

300
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,170
I'm not joking.

301
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,470
Don't be stupid.

302
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,870
Give me the gun.

303
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,070
Please.

304
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,370
Let him fucking hurt me.

305
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,670
I won't.

306
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,470
Danny.

307
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,770
Promise me.

308
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,170
I promise.

309
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,270
Where the fuck were you?

310
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,170
She's taking a shit.
I had to keep the gun on her.

311
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,370
And you did it by yourself?

312
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,670
It's no problem.
I just watched her.

313
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,670
Look at me! Look at me!

314
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:34,870
Is she ok?

315
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,770
Yeah.

316
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,470
Go look if you like.

317
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,770
Speak to her dad?
Saw the video?

318
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,670
I think he now understands
the gravity of the situation.

319
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,770
So when is the exchange?

320
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,370
Tomorrow.

321
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,970
- You made the arrangement?
- No.

322
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,870
He don't have time to prepare.

323
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,470
As soon as he gets the money,
then we start it moving.

324
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,370
- So it's all ok?
- Yeah.

325
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,070
- This is gonna work?
- Of course it is.

326
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,670
You should get some sleep.
We have a busy day tomorrow.

327
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:21,870
You don't want to?

328
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,670
No. There is too much adrenaline
running through me.

329
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,770
You sleep first.

330
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,070
You need me to check on her?

331
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,070
I think I can handle it for a while.

332
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,470
- Are you sure?
- Oh yeah.

333
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:42,970
Use this!

334
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,270
Thanks.

335
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,270
Sleep tight.

336
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,570
Fuck!

337
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,870
What time is it?
Why didn't you wake me up?

338
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,170
I didn't need to fucking
fall asleep, did I?

339
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,670
Shit! The girl.

340
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,970
Wake up!

341
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,070
Wake up, Ms. Creed.

342
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,970
It's breakfast time.

343
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,470
It's minestrone.

344
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,870
It's hot.

345
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,070
Oops.

346
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,670
Got it.

347
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:05,070
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

348
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,970
What are you doing?

349
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,570
Go back to the other side
and keep her in the eye.

350
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,170
Finished.

351
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,970
Good.

352
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,470
Open up!

353
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,870
Give it to me.

354
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,870
Give me the spoon.

355
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,770
- What's gone into you?
- Nothing.

356
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,970
I'm fine.

357
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,170
You don't look fine.

358
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,470
Don't start thinking.

359
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,070
I need you focused.

360
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,970
I am.

361
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,570
Are you sure?

362
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,170
Absolutely.

363
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,970
Good. Cause I need you.

364
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,170
I can't do this without you.

365
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,270
You got me.

366
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,470
Good boy.

367
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,170
Where you going?

368
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:32,470
Take a piss. Is that alright?

369
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,670
You okay in there?

370
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,270
Danny, what's wrong?

371
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,870
Everything is fine.

372
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:33,770
Are you sure?

373
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,070
But? I'll just be a second.

374
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,270
Danny, are you okay in there?

375
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,570
Danny?

376
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,470
Danny?

377
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,670
Danny!

378
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,770
What the fuck
are you doing in there?

379
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:47,670
Nothing.

380
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:51,170
Danny, open this door right now,
or I'll kick it in.

381
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,170
Open this fucking door!

382
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,370
Open this fucking door, now!

383
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,370
Right, I'm coming in!

384
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:03,370
- Jesus fuck ... what the fuck ...?
- Why the fuck don't you open the door?

385
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,470
I do not know what you?

386
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:07,970
I was worried.

387
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,670
I said I would be out in a second.

388
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,570
Something wouldn't go down.

389
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,270
You said you just needed to piss.

390
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,770
Thought I did.

391
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,370
It's gone now.

392
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,770
Sometimes a jam.

393
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,370
What?

394
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,670
Doesn't smell of any stink of you.

395
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,770
My shit don't stink.
What can I say?

396
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:44,370
Jus' wash your hands
and stop fucking about!

397
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,970
It's the adrenaline.

398
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,670
Suddenly you shit.

399
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,470
Bad taste in your mouth.

400
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,670
Because of the  adrenaline.

401
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,770
Happened to me when I made
the first call.

402
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,770
Just relax, Danny.

403
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,970
We need air.

404
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,970
Not long till the bank opens.

405
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:21,170
And after that? Showtime.

406
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,570
We're gonna be rich. Me and you.

407
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,670
We're gonna be millionaires.

408
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,870
We're nearly there, Dan.

409
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,770
We're nearly there.

410
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,470
You're all up?

411
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,170
I'm good.

412
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:44,270
- Are you sure?
- Why is that?

413
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,070
Two days ...

414
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:51,370
we're gonna be on the other side
of the world.

415
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,170
Just me and you.

416
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:57,070
Just me and you.

417
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:01,270
Away from this shit.
Away from the past.

418
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,470
And we're startin' new lives,

419
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,270
and new people,

420
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:11,170
being happy.

421
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:16,670
But the first two weeks,
we'll hardly get out a bit.

422
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:22,670
We'll just order room service,
and fuck each other senseless.

423
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,870
That sounds perfect.

424
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,970
Destiny.

425
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,070
Gotta go.

426
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,270
I see you soon.

427
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,670
You take care.

428
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,170
You too.

429
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,670
I love you.

430
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,570
I love you too, baby.

431
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,670
- Are you alright?
- Where is he?

432
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,770
It's gonna happen soon.

433
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,970
That fucking bullet case.
I thought he'd seen it.

434
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,670
It's Ok. Got rid of it.

435
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:11,970
How long until he comes back?

436
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:13,270
An hour I guess.

437
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:15,270
Maybe less.

438
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,970
Untie me.

439
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,670
Come on, Danny. Untie me.

440
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:22,470
He's gone.

441
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:44,170
Danny?

442
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:45,570
The other one?

443
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,070
Danny? What's wrong?

444
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:50,770
Come on, Danny. Unlock it.

445
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:52,570
- Do you fucking trust me?
- Of course, but ...

446
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:55,770
But what? I let you gag me,
tie me back up, that?

447
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:58,470
I fucking trusted you,
so you can fucking trust me.

448
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,570
I do trust you too.

449
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:00,770
But what?

450
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:03,070
- You think I'm gonna run?
- No, I do not.

451
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,670
Look, place the end right.

452
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,970
As soon he comes back,
we're taking it to the exchange ...

453
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:09,370
Are we gonna get the money?

454
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:10,270
Yeah.

455
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,070
Why would I run?

456
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,570
I am sorry.

457
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:22,670
I'm just jumpy.

458
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:30,770
This is fucking stressful.

459
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,670
You think?

460
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,070
Thanks.

461
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,470
Those things
are very fucking painful.

462
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:54,470
- Pins and needles in my
fingers and toes. ¦- Yeah

463
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:03,770
- Better?
- Ok.

464
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:09,170
Danny, what if your friend ...

465
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:11,970
think ... what if he?

466
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,070
- What if he is onto us? What if
he suspects us? ¦- He doesn't.

467
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:18,270
- Yeah, but what if he does?
- Believe me, he hasn't got a clue.

468
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,170
How did you do it?

469
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,970
- What? ¦- How did you get him
to agree to pick me for this?

470
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:25,970
You fit his criteria.

471
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:31,570
Attractive? Female?
In her 20s, only child.

472
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,670
- Slim enough to cat easy.
- Jesus.

473
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:37,870
Vic's been planning this forever.

474
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:40,270
Old-timer in prison talked about it.

475
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,870
I never really thought
he would do it, but?

476
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,070
When he got out, he contacted me.

477
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,570
He set about looking for a target.

478
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:53,670
Of course, then afterward ...

479
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,470
So he tested me?

480
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,970
But you did not tell him that we
knew each other from before?

481
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:00,070
Of course not.

482
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:04,070
Dad's on the rich list.

483
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:07,070
He said just write your name
in that newspaper article though.

484
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:09,070
I even cut it out and gave it to Vic.

485
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,370
He went for you right away.

486
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:14,570
He said you were "Perfect".

487
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:19,470
- Where is he now?
- Arranging the exchange.

488
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,270
At the ...?

489
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:23,270
Near the river? Driving nearby.

490
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,570
So he can escape,
and dad can find you.

491
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:27,070
And Vic gets the money.

492
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,570
- By himself?
- I stay with you.

493
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:31,470
But he could just steal it
and disappear.

494
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:32,270
Ah no, he wouldn't.

495
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:33,270
How can you be sure?

496
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:34,970
I just am.

497
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:36,170
Trust me.

498
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,270
It's not even considered.

499
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:41,570
And when he's getting the money,
I'll be setting you free.

500
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:45,170
And once he has money,
I'm going to take it from him,

501
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:48,170
and we meet up,

502
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,570
get the fuck out of here.

503
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,170
How you take the money?

504
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,770
He trusts me.

505
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,370
It will be easy.

506
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,770
- He trusts you?
- Completely.

507
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:06,570
- Danny?
- What?

508
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:09,870
I'm scared.

509
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:11,570
- Don't let me?
- I am sorry.

510
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:14,270
It's ok.

511
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,170
I won't let anything
happen to you.

512
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:19,070
Trust me.

513
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:21,870
Everything's going to be fine.

514
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:32,270
- Danny?
- What?

515
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:43,170
I love you so much.

516
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,770
I love you too, baby.

517
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:10,570
Alice, this isn't fucking funny.

518
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:11,570
I'm warning you.

519
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,770
What the fuck?
What the fuck are you doing?

520
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:14,970
What the fuck
do you think I'm doing?

521
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:17,070
- Alice, you can't do this.
- Fuck you!

522
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:18,370
I was so close.

523
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:21,070
- Close what?
- You fucking kidnapped me, you cunt.

524
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:22,970
You do not expect me to sit
around and just let it happen?

525
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:25,370
- But we had a plan.
- No, you had a plan.

526
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:27,170
This is my plan.

527
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:29,970
Alice, Alice come back!

528
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:45,070
Police? Quick. I need the police.

529
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,070
Why don't you come and get me?
I have been kidnapped.

530
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:49,670
I havn't got much time.
I don't know where I am.

531
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:52,270
No, I've been locked here.
I can't get out.

532
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:57,670
No. I don't recognize anything.

533
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:58,870
I'm up high.

534
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:02,070
Can't you trace the call?

535
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:04,370
Yeah. Ah, thank God.

536
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:05,870
How long will that take?

537
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:07,370
How long?

538
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,570
No, no-no-no.
You have to come get me now.

539
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,670
If the other guy's coming back,
he'll kill me.

540
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,670
He's gonna come back.
He's gonna fucking kill me.

541
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,770
You're have to come right now,
right now, right fucking now!

542
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:18,770
Calm down?
He's gonna fucking kill me.

543
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:26,870
Wait a second?

544
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:28,970
I think, I can get the keys.

545
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:53,170
I love you.

546
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:54,970
I fucking love you.

547
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:56,670
And you love me, I know you do.

548
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,470
- I know you do.
- Where are the keys?

549
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:01,070
Alice, you can't do this.

550
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:02,770
I love you.

551
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,470
No, Danny.

552
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:09,870
When you love someone, you do
everything you can to care for them.

553
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:14,870
What you don't do, is kidnap them.

554
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,570
Understand?

555
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,070
You don't fucking jump them
in the streets,

556
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,170
and put them in the back of a van.

557
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:23,970
You don't put a fucking knife
to their throats.

558
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:25,970
The keys!

559
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:31,870
I swear it to God, Danny.

560
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:34,470
You need to tell me
where the keys are.

561
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:38,370
In my pocket, right-hand pocket.

562
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:45,970
Go back on the bed!

563
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:49,670
Get back on the fucking bed!

564
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,370
Don't fucking move!

565
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:38,270
The safety was on.

566
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:41,870
Not anymore.

567
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:43,570
The keys?

568
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:46,070
Throw me the fucking keys!

569
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:24,170
Oh, c'mon ... fuck ... c'mon

570
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:31,070
I'm fucked.

571
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:34,270
Fuck!

572
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:44,970
Why didn't you just listen to me?

573
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:48,470
All would have been alright
if you just listened to me.

574
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:44,970
Is everything okay?

575
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:47,970
- Top-notch.
- She still in there?

576
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:50,270
- Where else would she be?
- Yeah ...

577
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,370
Yes of course. It's just?

578
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:57,270
It's time? It's on.

579
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,370
- He's got the money?
- Yeah.

580
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:00,270
He's just waiting at the location.

581
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:02,770
This is really quite a fucking work.

582
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:06,870
Right. We have to move her outta
there and put her in the warehouse.

583
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:08,170
- When do we leave?
- Now!

584
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:09,670
We move now.

585
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:19,870
This is it.

586
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,470
We're gonna have to move you now.
Understand?

587
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:26,170
Nod if you understand.

588
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:32,170
Hey! Wake up!

589
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:35,270
She's air-cold.

590
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:37,070
What the fuck did you do?

591
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:38,270
Nothing. I thought she was sleeping.

592
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,070
Fuck! Must be the gag that's
complicated her throat.

593
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:41,370
Is she alright?

594
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:43,670
Wait here.

595
00:57:58,270 --> 00:57:59,370
Thank God.

596
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:01,070
I thought we had killed her.

597
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,070
Wake up, Miss Creed.

598
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:05,470
Wake up.

599
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:06,470
Say something.

600
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:09,070
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Are you okay? Say something.

601
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:10,670
You need to calm down.

602
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:12,070
She's alright.

603
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:14,070
Everything is fine.

604
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:17,670
She's got a minute to breathe.

605
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:22,270
Come on. Let's just have
a minute together,

606
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:23,570
to re-focus.

607
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:27,870
Come on.

608
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:29,370
Look at me.

609
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:31,670
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

610
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:34,570
Shit. Fuck.

611
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:40,270
Will you do something for me?

612
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:42,470
What?

613
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,770
Tell me what to do.

614
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:48,570
I need you to stop worrying.

615
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:49,870
And just be back.

616
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:53,470
Makes confident.
That pushes me on ... to be mean.

617
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:54,270
Me?

618
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:56,670
Meanest fuck.

619
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:59,370
That's the back I want.

620
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,370
That's the guy they want.

621
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:03,570
So c'mon,

622
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:05,070
push me right.

623
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:06,970
Tell me what to do.

624
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:11,870
Stand the fuck up.

625
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:19,470
Go, put on your coat.

626
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:30,470
I can't put the van into position.

627
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:33,370
The van?

628
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,870
- Now?
- Yes, fucking now!

629
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:38,170
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna pack the bag.

630
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:40,570
- But don't unpack?
- Just fucking do it!

631
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:41,970
Now!

632
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:43,770
Go on!

633
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:57,270
No? Please.

634
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:59,570
No, wait. Please wait.
Wait a second.

635
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:05,770
What the fuck?

636
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,070
How did you get this?

637
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:08,670
How the fuck did you get this?

638
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:11,270
Quietly.

639
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:12,670
Tell me how you got it.

640
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:14,070
Tell me!

641
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:15,270
I don't know.

642
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,870
How did you fucking get it?

643
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:17,970
I don't know.

644
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:19,870
Please let? I don't want
to cause any trouble.

645
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:21,770
I just wanna do exactly as you say.

646
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:22,870
999.

647
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:24,670
Police.

648
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:26,570
Did you call the police?

649
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:29,970
- The fucking police ... did you call
the police? ¦- I don't know, I just?

650
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:31,470
Tell me the truth.

651
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:34,970
How could I? I've been up
tied up since I got here.

652
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:36,570
Then how did you
get that fucking phone?

653
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:38,070
- Don't know.
- Tell me the truth.

654
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:39,070
- I don't know.
- Tell me!

655
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,770
I don't know it. Don't know.

656
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:42,970
Please don't.

657
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:44,870
- Tell me.
- I don't know.

658
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:47,670
Tell me! Tell me!
Fucking tell me!

659
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:49,770
Please stop it! No!

660
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:53,670
Danny, help me. Danny.
Danny!

661
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:55,670
Danny?!

662
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:57,070
How do you know that name.

663
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,670
Help me, please, Danny.

664
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:02,570
How did you know his name.

665
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:04,470
Do you know him?

666
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,070
No, I ...

667
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,670
He just told me his name.

668
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:09,770
- He gave you the phone.
- No.

669
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:11,370
You phoned?

670
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:13,070
And you throw it down?

671
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:16,170
What else is there?

672
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:21,070
- I don't know. Please. Please ...
- Fuck!

673
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:23,970
Fuck!

674
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:26,170
Please, please just take me home.

675
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:27,570
Shut up!

676
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:52,970
- What happened here?
- Nothing.

677
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:54,570
Just take me home, please.

678
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:55,470
Please.

679
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,570
- This is a bullet.
- I don't know.

680
01:01:57,570 --> 01:01:58,470
I don't know.

681
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:00,070
Who fired the gun?

682
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:03,870
Who fired the gun?!

683
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:08,270
Please just take me home.
I don't ... I've done nothing!

684
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:10,670
You tell me, or I swear to God ...

685
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:13,070
you'll never see your family again.

686
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:15,970
Tell me!

687
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:20,870
I fired.

688
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:26,570
I needed the toilet.

689
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:28,870
He turned his back,

690
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:31,370
I hit him, and took his gun.

691
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:33,270
Well, if you got the gun,

692
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:35,970
then why you still here?

693
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:40,070
Because? Because he's
gonna fuck you.

694
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:42,370
He's gonna take the money.

695
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:43,770
The whole two million.

696
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,870
I am still here because he
made a deal with me.

697
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:49,070
He said if I went along
with the Plan ...

698
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:50,070
he would ...

699
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:53,170
He would give you
some of the money.

700
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:57,270
It all went so quickly, and?

701
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:58,970
you were coming back.

702
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:00,770
I couldn't get away, so?

703
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:02,370
I agreed.

704
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:06,170
I am sorry.

705
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:12,670
But now you know.

706
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:13,870
You can?

707
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:16,770
You can go along with the plan.

708
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:19,670
You can just pick up the money ...

709
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:21,970
and you can disappear.

710
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:24,870
He can fuck him instead, right?

711
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,970
You can take the money, all of it.

712
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:32,270
Fuck him, right?

713
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:36,770
You can just take me back
to my father.

714
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:40,470
You can take me back to my family.

715
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:43,270
All I want is to go back to my home.

716
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:48,470
Please, please, please ...

717
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:52,470
What is my name?

718
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:55,770
What?

719
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:59,770
I? I don't know.

720
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:01,870
I don't know your name.

721
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:03,270
Yes, you do.

722
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:05,570
He told you.

723
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:11,170
Tell me now, please.

724
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:13,970
He didn't tell me your name.

725
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:16,670
Please.

726
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:17,970
You're lying.

727
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:19,670
Please. I just want to go home.

728
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:22,370
- I can see you're lying ...
- I just wanna to go home. I?

729
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:14,070
What's wrong?

730
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:16,270
Why would anything be wrong?

731
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:19,970
You just seem a bit?

732
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:21,270
A bit what?

733
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:23,470
Shall we go, get her up?

734
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:25,870
I already did it.

735
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:27,570
I was just in there.

736
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:28,970
You were?

737
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:41,570
Is she alright?

738
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:47,770
Vic, is she alright?

739
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:04,970
I'm going for a piss.

740
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:09,270
Wait here.

741
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:39,370
Danny, tell me something?

742
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,570
Why did you choose her?

743
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:45,770
I didn't choose her.

744
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:47,370
You choose her?

745
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:48,870
Yes, but you suggested her.

746
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:50,270
Why?

747
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:53,670
You know why?

748
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:55,970
I read about her in the newspaper.

749
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:57,870
What's this all about, Vic?

750
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:00,470
Jus'? Something doesn't
feel quite right.

751
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:01,670
What d'you mean?

752
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:03,170
Just now ...

753
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:05,770
she was acting funny.

754
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:07,970
Why? What did she say?

755
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:09,570
Say?

756
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:14,670
Why would you think
she'd say anything?

757
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:16,970
I don't? Ah?

758
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:20,670
- You said she was acting funny.
- Yeah.

759
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,870
I didn't say she said anything.

760
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:24,570
What could she say?

761
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:27,970
What do you think she would say?

762
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:31,670
Come here.

763
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:35,570
I said, come here!

764
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:58,270
- Tell me you love me.
- What?

765
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:00,070
Tell me ...

766
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:02,070
you love me.

767
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:05,470
I love you, babe.

768
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:08,370
Truly.

769
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:12,870
Let's get this thing done!

770
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:08,970
Wait here.

771
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:08,870
What happened to her face?

772
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:09,870
I told you.

773
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:11,370
She was acting funny.

774
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:13,370
So I had to give her a slap.

775
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:23,070
Bryce, give me your set-keys.

776
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:24,270
You got your own set,
why do you want mine?

777
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:27,070
Because you don't need
them anymore, do you?

778
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:29,570
Why? Is there a problem?

779
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:30,470
No problem.

780
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:32,570
Then give them to me.

781
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:47,870
Bryce, let's go.

782
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,370
To where?

783
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:50,870
Let's go and get the money.

784
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:52,270
Both of us?

785
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:53,670
The plan was I would stay here.

786
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:55,470
- Plan has changed.
- Changed?

787
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:57,070
I need you to meet.

788
01:11:57,170 --> 01:11:58,270
In case there's any surprises.

789
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:00,870
- Like what? ¦- If I knew that, they
won't be surprises, would they?

790
01:12:00,970 --> 01:12:02,770
But what if something happens?

791
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:03,870
What if we don't make it back?

792
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:05,970
- We'll make it.
- But if we??

793
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:08,670
If we don't, she'll be stuck here.

794
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:10,970
- She'll die.
- So?

795
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:12,270
If we don't make it,

796
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:14,470
why do you care
if she don't make it?

797
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:19,570
I don't care.

798
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:21,370
Good.

799
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:23,470
Now, let's get the fuck
out of here!

800
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:13,170
- You think it's there?
- Yeah.

801
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:14,970
It's there.

802
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:16,870
Go out and get it!

803
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:17,970
Me?

804
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:18,970
Danny,

805
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:20,970
just go and get the fucking money!

806
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:24,770
Now!

807
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:29,070
There's no fucking money.

808
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:31,170
They fucked us over.

809
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:34,770
- We're fucked up.
- No, they didn't fuck up.

810
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:39,070
The money is not here because
I didn't say it was at this location.

811
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:42,770
The hole?

812
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:48,270
- This hole is for the money.
- No.

813
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:52,370
Now, this hole is for you, Danny.

814
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:54,470
I didn't fuck up.

815
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:55,870
You did.

816
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:00,170
Please.

817
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:01,870
Don't do this.

818
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,870
What did you tell her about me?

819
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:11,470
Nothing.

820
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:13,170
You told her my name.

821
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:18,370
Only your first name.

822
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:22,870
- Only that we met in prison, that it,
that's all. ¦- You fucking dealed.

823
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:25,570
You killed her, Danny.

824
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:28,370
You've not only killed yourself,

825
01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:30,870
but you've killed her too.

826
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:33,470
You do not have to do this.

827
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:36,170
We can just finish this,

828
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:37,970
like we planned.

829
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:40,970
We'll go away.

830
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:43,370
We'll be happy.

831
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:45,870
I'll do everything you want me to.

832
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:48,370
It'll just be you.

833
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:51,070
That's what we wanted.

834
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:53,470
I love you.

835
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:55,970
Close your eyes.

836
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:56,570
Danny,

837
01:15:56,770 --> 01:15:58,170
close your eyes.

838
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:00,570
Do you remember when we met?

839
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:02,970
Can you remember?

840
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:06,470
We slept in the cell.

841
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:08,770
I was scared.

842
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:11,870
I was so fucking scared.

843
01:16:12,570 --> 01:16:14,070
You protected me.

844
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:16,770
You ... helped me.

845
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:19,770
I will never forget that.

846
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:22,570
I will never ...

847
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:11,070
It's almost over.

848
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:15,170
Please be still Miss Creed.

849
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:18,670
It'll all be over very quickly.

850
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:20,870
You will feel no pain.

851
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:33,270
Danny.

852
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:37,270
Danny, you're bleeding.

853
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:40,270
I can get you to a hospital.

854
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:42,870
I'll get you fixed up.

855
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:51,470
You'll die, Danny.

856
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:53,970
Listen!

857
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:56,070
You'll die.

858
01:20:58,170 --> 01:20:59,770
Let me help you.

859
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:00,970
Danny?

860
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:04,670
Let me protect you.

861
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:08,070
- Stand against the fucking wall!
- Ok.

862
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:10,470
Whatever you want.

863
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:12,270
Danny!

864
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:25,370
Ah, Danny ...

865
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:28,070
Get me off here.

866
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:32,670
Keys?

867
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:34,370
Toss the keys.

868
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:35,670
Danny,

869
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:37,470
don't do this, please.

870
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:39,170
Give me the fucking keys!

871
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:47,370
Danny, you love me.

872
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:49,170
I know you do.

873
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:50,270
Shut up!

874
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:52,570
I felt him.

875
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:55,870
When you held me ...

876
01:21:57,970 --> 01:22:00,770
and you kissed me ...
- Shut the fuck up.

877
01:22:03,970 --> 01:22:05,870
When you made love me,

878
01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:07,970
there was no fucking doubt.

879
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:11,370
You love me.

880
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:14,570
You love me.

881
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:19,070
You give me the gun,
and I'll get you fixed up.

882
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:26,170
Give me the gun.

883
01:22:27,570 --> 01:22:30,470
Danny, don't give him the gun.

884
01:22:30,470 --> 01:22:32,570
It's Ok my little Danny-boy.

885
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:33,470
No?

886
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:35,170
Don't give him the gun.

887
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:36,170
It's Ok.

888
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:38,770
Get me out of here. Don't, don't ...

889
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:41,970
Don't cry.

890
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:45,170
Don't, don't ...
don't give him the gun.

891
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:48,170
- Danny, don't listen to him.
- What I'm gonna do? - Danny!

892
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:52,370

893
01:23:23,870 --> 01:23:29,570

01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:48,270
- Shoulda listened.
- No.

898
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:51,070
It's alright, babe.

899
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:54,470

Danny! Don't you fucking

904
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:05,970

01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:10,970
