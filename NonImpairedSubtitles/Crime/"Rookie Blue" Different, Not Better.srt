1
00:00:01,922 --> 00:00:03,056
McNally, you okay?

2
00:00:03,123 --> 00:00:04,923
Maybe she's dead.

3
00:00:04,991 --> 00:00:06,524
Missed me by a hair.

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:08,760
I'm really hungry, and I wanna get drunk.

5
00:00:08,828 --> 00:00:10,495
Peck, put your headgear on.

6
00:00:15,534 --> 00:00:17,402
All we gotta do is get the polka-dot camel.

7
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:18,536
The mission's ours.

8
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:20,638
Yeah, that's a giraffe.

9
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:22,306
It's a camel.

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,477
Okay, okay.

11
00:00:30,182 --> 00:00:32,750
McNally's down. Now there's only Epstein.

12
00:00:32,818 --> 00:00:35,019
- What about Peck?
- She's probably hiding behind a bunker somewhere,

13
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:37,153
drinking a wine cooler.

14
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:38,788
Watch my back. I'll do a head check.

15
00:00:40,524 --> 00:00:42,258
Let's get those smug bastards.

16
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:44,894
Here's the plan. They
think we're down, right?

17
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,529
So you two, push the left tape line

18
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:47,897
and leave the rest to me.

19
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,166
Normal adults... they join book clubs.

20
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:51,835
Just go. Just take them.

21
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:54,570
- Ready?
- Go.

22
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:05,381
We got two pushing on our
right. Watch my tracer.

23
00:01:09,518 --> 00:01:10,652
Did you get 'em?

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,520
No. But we got 'em pinned.

25
00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:16,491
Nash, you move to the far right bunker.

26
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:18,260
Diaz, you watch your six.

27
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:21,563
- You think this is a good plan?
- I know what I'm doing.

28
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:23,732
I was in the army, remember?
I've trained for this.

29
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:31,438
Contact.

30
00:01:39,748 --> 00:01:42,282
I'm down!

31
00:01:54,027 --> 00:01:55,261
Come on out!

32
00:01:56,563 --> 00:01:58,196
She got us. She got us.

33
00:01:58,264 --> 00:01:59,998
I got it!

34
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:05,136
Dov.

35
00:02:05,204 --> 00:02:06,638
All right.

36
00:02:06,673 --> 00:02:08,640
Retreat your asses to the death box.

37
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:11,743
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Rub it in a bit, McNally.

38
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:13,011
Hey, listen, I'm not

39
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:14,478
the dumb new kid on the
block anymore, right?

40
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:17,682
I set my mind to something, I
fight to the death, and I win.

41
00:02:17,716 --> 00:02:19,650
Pop.

42
00:02:19,685 --> 00:02:20,818
Good work.

43
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:22,953
Think she's talking about paintball?

44
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:26,089
I think she's talking about Sam Swarek.

45
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:27,758
Come on. Wrap up. Let's go.

46
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:36,693
So... Marlo... is she cool?

47
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:38,862
Sure. But so are you.

48
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:40,630
Yeah, but I mean, is she cooler?

49
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:43,232
She's... different, not better.

50
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:46,001
I mean, are they serious?

51
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:47,168
They've only been seeing
each other a little while.

52
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:48,404
They're not serious.

53
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:50,238
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure.

54
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:52,808
Um... okay. Yeah.

55
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:54,576
Hey.

56
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:55,778
Morning.

57
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:57,780
Wow. You look like you worked all weekend.

58
00:02:57,814 --> 00:02:59,481
Oh, I did. What did you do?

59
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:01,016
Paintball.

60
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,350
You win?

61
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:05,920
Yep. I rocked it.

62
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:08,355
Nothing you like more than
a little competition, huh?

63
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,657
Yeah, that's right.

64
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:11,358
It's 'cause I have a special talent.

65
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:13,761
Oh. Which is?

66
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:15,630
You've known me for three years.

67
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:17,231
Why don't you take a guess?

68
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:20,333
(Man speaking indistinctly over P.A.

69
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,303
It's so awesome in here,

70
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,505
like an industrial loft
meets a police smackdown.

71
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,307
Oh, God. I parked out front. Do
you think that's gonna be okay?

72
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,508
It's the girl from the other night.

73
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:30,009
She's stalking me at work now.

74
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:34,112
- Frank's goddaughter? The crazy one you had sex with?
- Yeah.

75
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,315
- She won't take a hint. Yeah.
- Um, but I'm actually wondering...

76
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,617
All right, do you wanna
stay low? Scootch outta here?

77
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,954
What, you mean... waddle like ducks?

78
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:47,025
Or... we could face the storm head on.

79
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,027
I'm tougher than I look.

80
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,595
- Watch out.
- Let's waddle.

81
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,497
Yeah.

82
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:55,567
Our division has a little problem...

83
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:58,703
six A.T.M. holdups in the last week.

84
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,272
We believe it's the same guy.

85
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,639
What are the links?

86
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:03,275
From all accounts, he's
5'10", medium build.

87
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,509
This guy's quick and dirty.

88
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,043
He waits till his victims have their money,

89
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:08,179
comes in with his gun, takes what they got.

90
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:12,016
- But then before he leaves, he gives them back a $20.
- Yeah.

91
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:14,051
He's always completely masked,

92
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:15,752
so the cameras haven't given us anything,

93
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,156
but last night he gave us a little show.

94
00:04:19,224 --> 00:04:20,358
Uh... what's he doing?

95
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:22,359
Wait for it.

96
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:24,927
Do they call that an ass sleeve?

97
00:04:24,996 --> 00:04:28,564
Right now it's the only
concrete lead we have.

98
00:04:28,632 --> 00:04:30,867
We can't ask to see that
tattoo without a warrant.

99
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:34,471
Correct. Our detectives have
narrowed it down to ten guys,

100
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:37,707
based on witness
statements and probability.

101
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:39,008
These guys are all known to us.

102
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:39,975
We need you to start ruling 'em out.

103
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:41,510
Track 'em down. Question 'em.

104
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:44,546
If they don't have rock-solid
alibis, bring 'em in.

105
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:46,715
We're gonna break you up
into different neighborhoods.

106
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:49,385
Each team will take a couple of these guys.

107
00:04:49,452 --> 00:04:50,719
We'll find 'em, sir.

108
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:53,522
Chloe, where have you been?

109
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:55,890
This big division got kinda turned around.

110
00:04:55,924 --> 00:04:57,258
How's it going?

111
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:58,692
Everybody, I want you to meet Chloe Price.

112
00:04:58,727 --> 00:04:59,994
Chloe, come on up here.

113
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:03,097
- She's a cop.
- She's a cop.

114
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:05,033
Chloe's come over from 27 division

115
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,835
- after eight months on the force.
- Mm-hmm.

116
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:09,937
And, uh, she happens to be my goddaughter.

117
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:12,605
But that doesn't mean she's
gonna get special treatment.

118
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,642
Hey, Froink. Hey, everybody.

119
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:17,177
Hey, Dov.

120
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:20,047
You two know each other?

121
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:23,150
We met, yeah. At your... engagement party.

122
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:24,384
Oh. Yeah.

123
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,385
Okay, good, good, great. Well, uh,

124
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,886
Epstein, why don't you two ride together?

125
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:29,288
- Oh, really, sir...
- Great.

126
00:05:29,322 --> 00:05:31,590
Peck, Collins, I need your
hands here at the station.

127
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:32,624
The rest of you,

128
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,560
your assignments are on the board.

129
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:37,596
- Epstein.
- Yes, sir?

130
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:40,999
I need you to do me a favor.

131
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:42,500
Keep her out of trouble.
I love this kid, all right?

132
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:43,701
I trust you.

133
00:05:43,735 --> 00:05:45,236
Sure. I won't let you down.

134
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:47,405
All right.

135
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,406
- Hey.
- Hi.

136
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:49,907
Hi. Nice to meet you.

137
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:51,109
Excuse me.

138
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,411
Wait up, partner.

139
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:58,515
- Here, I got something for you.
- What's that for?

140
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,618
Oh, I know you. You're gonna
need something to chew today.

141
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:06,056
So I've got the list
of suspects, addresses.

142
00:06:06,091 --> 00:06:09,393
Yeah. So do I. Queen East, right?

143
00:06:09,427 --> 00:06:10,727
Yep.

144
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:17,200
I was just gonna drive.

145
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:19,735
I mean, unless you wanna drive. Go ahead.

146
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:23,506
Oh. How about this? You drive.

147
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:36,251
So, uh... got any ideas?

148
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:37,919
Yeah, Nicky Radar. Every
time I run into that guy,

149
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:40,822
he's eerily polite. It's unnerving.

150
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:43,358
Well, I'm thinking, uh, Felix Whitall.

151
00:06:43,426 --> 00:06:46,027
Says here Felix has a
history of vandalism, pranks.

152
00:06:46,095 --> 00:06:47,428
That's clown stuff.

153
00:06:47,496 --> 00:06:49,563
Okay. Giving back the $20
seems like Nicky's style.

154
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:51,432
Is it Nicky's style to moon the camera?

155
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:53,467
It just seems more prankster to me.

156
00:06:53,535 --> 00:06:54,668
Well, Felix is in Jamestown,

157
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:55,969
and that's not our assigned area.

158
00:06:56,037 --> 00:06:58,271
Yeah, I don't think that
really matters to Sam,

159
00:06:58,339 --> 00:06:59,773
as long as we bring the right guy in.

160
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:01,108
Sure.

161
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:08,749
I called you to give you a heads-up.

162
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:10,315
You could have left a message.

163
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:11,817
I left a dozen messages.

164
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:14,186
Yeah. Weird messages, angry
messages, creepy messages.

165
00:07:14,254 --> 00:07:15,387
You never once said you were a cop,

166
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,189
starting at 15 Division.

167
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:20,552
Because that's like the juice of the call.

168
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:23,722
You can't spill the juice
of the call on voice mail.

169
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,457
Why not?

170
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:26,524
'Cause the whole point
of giving you the juice

171
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:28,126
is so I can witness the response.

172
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:30,295
- Look, do you believe in fate?
- No.

173
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:31,529
Because, I mean, come on...

174
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:33,597
don't you think Froink putting us together?

175
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:34,933
Why do you call him "Froink"?

176
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,600
Do I need a reason?

177
00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:43,440
You transferred to 15
Division 'cause of me.

178
00:07:43,474 --> 00:07:44,641
It can't happen that fast.

179
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:45,875
You know that.

180
00:07:45,944 --> 00:07:47,444
Plus it wasn't my choice, okay?

181
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,146
I totally got chased outta there.

182
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:50,447
Do you have a tissue, actually?

183
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:52,115
Wait, wait. What do you mean, "chased"?

184
00:07:52,183 --> 00:07:54,617
Uh... I grate the Staff Sergeant's nerves,

185
00:07:54,685 --> 00:07:57,754
and my so-called partner
requested a switch,

186
00:07:57,822 --> 00:07:59,788
and nobody wanted to ride with me.

187
00:07:59,823 --> 00:08:01,890
And so... Froink pulled some strings

188
00:08:01,925 --> 00:08:02,925
and got me here.

189
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:05,361
But w... why?

190
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:07,263
'Cause he knows I'm good. Thank you.

191
00:08:07,297 --> 00:08:09,265
Look...

192
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,566
I've only been a cop for eight months,

193
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:14,502
but I've been training
to do this my entire life.

194
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,704
Indirectly. You know what I mean?

195
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:20,675
Okay. Some people... are direct.

196
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,078
You know, they... they
walk a straight line.

197
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:25,246
And others are...
they're... they're squiggly,

198
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:27,248
and they, like, go this way and that way.

199
00:08:27,316 --> 00:08:29,351
And that's just more me, you know?

200
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:31,952
And plus I don't understand
the meaning of the word "no"

201
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:35,155
in any language, so that
makes me pretty dogged.

202
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,291
Ow.

203
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:39,193
Ow. Do you ever get
one of those air bubbles

204
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,995
under your kneecap?

205
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:42,896
Ow, it feels weird.

206
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:46,332
Are we going?

207
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:48,134
Oh, did you hear that pop?

208
00:08:50,037 --> 00:08:52,771
All right, the closest one on this list

209
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:55,708
is this guy... Beavertail Boulos.

210
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:57,776
What kind of name is that?

211
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:02,714
Uh, or we could swing by
this guy Steve Haddock.

212
00:09:02,748 --> 00:09:05,050
- Mm-hmm.
- They're both pretty close.

213
00:09:05,084 --> 00:09:06,351
Or throw some darts at a wall.

214
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:08,720
See where they land. You love darts.

215
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:10,322
Yeah, but darts are a thing of the past.

216
00:09:10,356 --> 00:09:12,124
I'm a dad now, so...

217
00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:14,292
Or we could think.

218
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:16,361
See this ass?

219
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:17,829
Yeah.

220
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:19,530
Yeah? All right, we're
gonna hit some ink shops,

221
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:22,599
and we're gonna find
out whose work this is.

222
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:26,170
Or... yeah. We could do that.

223
00:09:28,173 --> 00:09:29,320
Why would anyone have a
bike and leave it locked up

224
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:32,643
outside a store for a month?
Store owner finally cut it off.

225
00:09:32,677 --> 00:09:35,278
I'm still stumped on why
anyone would have a bike.

226
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:36,646
Is that all the stuff
that's being auctioned?

227
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,049
Yeah. Just... I don't know.
Just put it against that.

228
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,884
That's all the property
found within the last year.

229
00:09:46,223 --> 00:09:47,557
Ahh!

230
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:50,325
It's for a cleanse I'm doing.

231
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,494
It's really disgusting,
and I want you to try it.

232
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:54,296
No. Not with that introduction.

233
00:09:54,364 --> 00:09:55,897
But it's awful.

234
00:09:55,932 --> 00:09:57,466
So? Throw it out. I'm not drinking it.

235
00:09:57,534 --> 00:09:59,801
I thought we were...

236
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:01,303
- sort of...
- What?

237
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:04,173
Engaged... ish.

238
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,941
Doesn't that mean we
share each other's misery?

239
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:07,275
Better or worse?

240
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:09,027
No, it means I won't leave
you if you get cancer.

241
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:10,895
I'm not drinking your disgusting drink.

242
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:13,264
Wimp.

243
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,138
Hey, guys.

244
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:25,675
- How you doing?
- Good.

245
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,144
Yeah?

246
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,978
Yeah!

247
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:31,348
I love kids.

248
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:35,252
Yeah, and five years from now,
they're gonna be spitting on us.

249
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:38,287
Hey. Any of you guys know Felix Whitall?

250
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:40,423
Yeah. He's my brother.

251
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,690
He's no longer at his last known address.

252
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:43,292
Did he move back here
with you and your mom?

253
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,527
Yeah.

254
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,994
Do you know where we
can find him right now?

255
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:46,995
We just have to ask him a few questions.

256
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,297
It's no big deal.

257
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:52,000
He was working at the Dollar Store on Rose.

258
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,835
He's got it together,
you know. He's trying.

259
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,603
Great. Thank you.

260
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,873
Do you believe him?

261
00:10:58,907 --> 00:11:00,241
I mean, I think he believes himself.

262
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:02,177
Whether or not his brother's
living straight or not...

263
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:08,216
What the hell?

264
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:12,052
Stay away from the car!

265
00:11:19,393 --> 00:11:20,961
I think it's Wanda Starkes'.

266
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:22,395
You know her? Yeah, I've
dealt with her a few times.

267
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,825
I mean, she's got some
issues, but she's harmless.

268
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:27,893
You're driving everyone
nuts, you stupid bitch.

269
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:29,261
Hey, why don't you give it a rest?

270
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:33,397
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

271
00:11:33,432 --> 00:11:35,033
Get your ugly face outta here!

272
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:36,400
Okay, what's going on in here?

273
00:11:36,435 --> 00:11:37,668
Hey, hey, hey, don't
tase me. Don't tase me.

274
00:11:37,703 --> 00:11:38,937
I can't take getting tased
again. I really can't.

275
00:11:39,004 --> 00:11:40,972
Okay, we're not here
to tase anybody, Wanda.

276
00:11:41,006 --> 00:11:42,307
It's you. Officer McNally, right?

277
00:11:42,374 --> 00:11:44,542
- What's your name again?
- Andy.

278
00:11:44,576 --> 00:11:47,111
- Andy, I wasn't doing anything. You know me, right?
- Who threw the TV out the window?

279
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:48,279
He did.

280
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:49,512
I asked her nicely about a dozen times

281
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,881
to shut this down. You hear this?

282
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:54,031
She's got every machine
in the world going in here.

283
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:56,299
Come with me. Come on. Let's go.

284
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:58,435
I'm gonna turn some of these things off.

285
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:00,237
Yeah, yeah, I was just, you know,

286
00:12:00,271 --> 00:12:02,039
making sure everything worked. That's all.

287
00:12:07,444 --> 00:12:08,877
Look, you don't know what it's like, okay,

288
00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:10,579
to... to live next to a loon like that.

289
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,798
Don't I? How do you know, sir?

290
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,200
Do you know me?

291
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,401
No. I... don't.

292
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:18,136
But she's a crazy bitch. I'm telling you.

293
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,405
For all you know I take great offense

294
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,506
to men referring to women
with mental illnesses

295
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,374
as "crazy bitches."

296
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,343
Just go listen through the walls.

297
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,378
She makes so much noise. I work nights.

298
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,147
Yeah, okay, I get it.
Pots and pans banging,

299
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,516
screaming... gets in your head,

300
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,884
makes you feel like
you're the one going crazy.

301
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,520
Yeah, must be tough.

302
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,787
So you call it in. You
make a noise complaint.

303
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:39,456
1505. I'm gonna need a relay

304
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,626
to 2923 Gerrard, Willow
Creek, apartment 605.

305
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,529
Bringing in a prisoner, and
we're gonna need a new car.

306
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:47,063
Ours got damaged.

307
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:50,601
All right, what happened?

308
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:53,069
Nothing. It's just one
of those days, you know?

309
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:55,571
I needed... sounds. I
needed something intense,

310
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:57,005
you know, to take over.

311
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,374
Take over what?

312
00:12:58,442 --> 00:12:59,575
Everything. My brain.

313
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:01,544
Okay, well, did you take your walk today?

314
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:04,247
Remember how you told me that
walks kinda help calm you down?

315
00:13:04,281 --> 00:13:06,115
Yeah, well, I was going
to, but then that little kid

316
00:13:06,182 --> 00:13:07,816
was in the hallway. I hate that little kid.

317
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:09,851
I... I know, but you can't
let him get to you, you know?

318
00:13:09,885 --> 00:13:11,319
You have to tune him out.

319
00:13:11,387 --> 00:13:14,322
Yeah. Oh, y... yeah, but
then... this guy comes over,

320
00:13:14,357 --> 00:13:16,258
and he gets up in my face,
and next thing I know, he...

321
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:18,960
he rips my TV out of the wall,
and he throw it out the window.

322
00:13:18,994 --> 00:13:23,097
- Are you going to arrest him?
- Yes, he will be dealt with. I promise.

323
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,200
All right, how about your
meds? You take those today?

324
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:30,203
- No. Forgot.
- Okay, let's do that right now.

325
00:13:30,238 --> 00:13:33,707
That blanket's nice. Is that new?

326
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:36,777
Yeah, I bought it at a yard sale. 50 cents.

327
00:13:36,844 --> 00:13:38,712
- That's great.
- Thank you.

328
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,913
Did you arrest him?

329
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:42,081
Yes, I did, and he's gonna be charged,

330
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:44,484
but you're gonna have to keep
the noise down, all right?

331
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:46,319
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, relay came and picked him up.

332
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:48,154
Brought us a new car.

333
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:50,922
- How is she? Is she gonna be okay on her own?
- Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

334
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:54,393
All right, anything else
comes up, call me, all right?

335
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,161
Stay calm and calm me.

336
00:13:56,228 --> 00:13:58,330
Is that piano?

337
00:13:58,398 --> 00:14:00,332
Yeah. Beethoven.

338
00:14:15,447 --> 00:14:17,448
This was left in a vacant apartment.

339
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:20,367
Okay.

340
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:23,970
I believe there a cremated
human remains in it.

341
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,547
Yep. Those are cremated
human remains, all right.

342
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,617
So what are we supposed to do?

343
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:40,118
Did you contact the previous tenants?

344
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:41,987
They were university students.

345
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:44,089
They ran out on me two months' rent.

346
00:14:44,123 --> 00:14:47,092
I didn't wanna toss it in case
the person mattered to someone.

347
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,928
Someone was nice enough to cremate the body

348
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:52,397
and, uh, pick out a lovely urn.

349
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:54,665
It's very lovely. Okay,
well, we'll hang on to it

350
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,833
and store it in the properties room

351
00:14:55,868 --> 00:14:58,135
until I can track down a family member.

352
00:14:58,203 --> 00:15:01,038
Just gonna need to ask you
a few questions, all right?

353
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:02,940
This guy kinda looks like my brother,

354
00:15:02,974 --> 00:15:05,142
but maybe that's, like,
his decoy, you know?

355
00:15:05,176 --> 00:15:07,912
And then there's this guy,
who... I mean, look at those eyes.

356
00:15:07,946 --> 00:15:09,713
My money's on Miguel Garcias.

357
00:15:09,747 --> 00:15:11,548
Done. Let's find him.

358
00:15:11,582 --> 00:15:13,650
Ooh!

359
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:15,917
All right, how does a guy get so lucky?

360
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:17,519
Six holdups, and every time,

361
00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:19,288
he seems to fluke into big money?

362
00:15:19,322 --> 00:15:20,656
I know. Most guys who
do this sort of thing...

363
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,824
They get people to drain their accounts.

364
00:15:22,858 --> 00:15:25,826
But not this guy. Yet he
always manages to score big.

365
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,662
Hmm.

366
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:29,263
Okay, here's a plan.

367
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:30,631
Let's get some nice iced coffees,

368
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,966
and maybe a little
brownie or something yummy,

369
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:34,602
- and then we can go by all the A.T...
- Okay, this is not a date.

370
00:15:34,636 --> 00:15:35,869
We are trying to get a
menace off the streets.

371
00:15:35,904 --> 00:15:37,271
Do you get that?

372
00:15:37,306 --> 00:15:40,007
Yeah, I do.

373
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:45,545
Hey.

374
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:47,200
Are you... thirsty?

375
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:49,969
No. Just dropping off an abandoned urn.

376
00:15:50,003 --> 00:15:52,339
With ashes in it?

377
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:53,973
Yeah. I'm gonna leave it here

378
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:56,209
while I try to track down the family.

379
00:15:56,178 --> 00:15:58,479
- Do you have any information?
- Based on the manufacturer,

380
00:15:58,547 --> 00:16:00,147
there are two funeral homes in town

381
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:02,383
that carry this, so I'm working from there.

382
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:06,554
Hmm. Okay. Well... let me
know what you come up with.

383
00:16:06,588 --> 00:16:09,089
Why? Are you feeling for it?

384
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:12,392
I only wanna know, because
if someone comes to get him,

385
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:14,594
I don't wanna put him on the auction pile.

386
00:16:14,662 --> 00:16:17,129
Right.

387
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,587
How do you even know Miguel's here?

388
00:16:41,654 --> 00:16:42,887
I've been working this division four years.

389
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:44,689
I know. Stay here.

390
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:54,798
Hey, Miguel?

391
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:56,534
Mind if I ask you a couple questions?

392
00:16:59,137 --> 00:17:01,238
Last night, 11:00 P.M... you
wanna tell me where you were?

393
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:02,505
Or you could just save us all some time

394
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:03,906
and show us your ass.

395
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:07,110
Officer Price.

396
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:10,146
- Are you serious right now?
- Yes, I am.

397
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:12,215
Your right butt cheek, to be exact.

398
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,151
We're looking for a very specific tattoo.

399
00:17:15,219 --> 00:17:17,753
Don't be shy.

400
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:22,658
Yo.

401
00:17:22,726 --> 00:17:26,395
Thank you, Miguel. You are free to go.

402
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:27,796
Yes...

403
00:17:27,864 --> 00:17:29,565
Thank you, Miguel, for your cooperation.

404
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,634
Gentlemen, have a nice day.

405
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:38,072
You shouldn't have done
that without a warrant.

406
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,374
I didn't force him to do anything.

407
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:40,675
Still, it was stupid.

408
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:42,777
You know, I don't like that word.

409
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:45,212
Fine. I'm just saying you
could get in serious trouble.

410
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:46,814
He could charge you with harassment.

411
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:48,315
He would lose face in front of his friends

412
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:50,617
if he did that, okay? He was flattered.

413
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,253
And by the way, you were,
like, so much more fun

414
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:56,156
when you were drunk. Just F.Y.I.

415
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:10,983
Felix Whitall?

416
00:18:11,017 --> 00:18:12,818
Yeah.

417
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:14,519
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

418
00:18:14,587 --> 00:18:17,056
- What?
- Uh, do you mind telling us

419
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,758
where you were last night around 11:00?

420
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:21,460
Yeah. I was here. I was working.

421
00:18:21,494 --> 00:18:25,230
And your manager could verify that?

422
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:26,865
Hey, look, come on. I've...
I've been living straight

423
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,399
for months, okay?

424
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:30,802
We just need to verify your whereabouts.

425
00:18:32,537 --> 00:18:35,106
- Okay, look, um...
- Felix, don't e...

426
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:38,943
Excuse me.

427
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,861
Come on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

428
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,199
Uhh! I love it when I'm right.

429
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:04,667
Nine years on the job,
and the one thing I know

430
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:05,868
is innocent people don't run from the cops.

431
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:07,703
That's not why I ran.

432
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:09,872
Oh, yeah? Was it because of this?

433
00:19:09,907 --> 00:19:12,041
- This is gonna look really
good to your parole officer.

434
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:13,508
All units, we've got an armed robbery.

435
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:15,811
ATM at Shuter and Sherbrooke.

436
00:19:15,878 --> 00:19:18,713
- Appears to be the same suspect
as last night's holdup. See?

437
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:20,348
You see?

438
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:21,683
Whoever you're looking for, it's not me.

439
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:22,951
1504. We're on our way.

440
00:19:22,985 --> 00:19:24,953
Oh, yeah, you're real innocent.

441
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:37,464
Pretty much the same deal.
Made off with 800 bucks,

442
00:19:37,532 --> 00:19:39,733
except this time, the vic
put up a little resistance,

443
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:42,236
and our guy beat the
living daylights out of him.

444
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:44,471
Says he didn't see anything,
but he was wearing a mask.

445
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:45,705
What about surveillance?

446
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:47,373
We're waiting on footage.

447
00:19:47,441 --> 00:19:50,476
The only thing he said to the victim...

448
00:19:50,544 --> 00:19:53,412
- "Life is beautiful."
- Well, that's ironic.

449
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:55,315
Maybe this guy's just getting
bored with taking money.

450
00:19:55,282 --> 00:19:58,151
First, he moons the camera,
now he's beating people up.

451
00:19:58,185 --> 00:19:59,786
I'm gonna go to the
hospital with the victim,

452
00:19:59,854 --> 00:20:02,154
and I'll get his official
statement once he's settled.

453
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:04,489
Well, you can rule out Felix Whitall.

454
00:20:04,557 --> 00:20:06,158
We were with him when the call came in.

455
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:08,160
What? You went after Whitall?

456
00:20:08,228 --> 00:20:10,796
- He was on the Jamestown list.
- I know.

457
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:13,465
- That's not your part of town.
- It was on the list.

458
00:20:13,532 --> 00:20:16,268
Oh, okay. Clearly your
talent isn't following orders.

459
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:18,636
Okay, well, you said to rule him out.

460
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:21,672
Did what you asked.
It's not Miguel Garcias.

461
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,675
Okay. Keep moving down your lists, please.

462
00:20:25,743 --> 00:20:27,443
Okay?

463
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:29,212
Look at that.

464
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:31,648
What? The sofa. I mean, imagine it,

465
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:33,683
reupholstered in pink velvet.

466
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:35,718
I would kill for that sofa.

467
00:20:35,753 --> 00:20:37,888
And check out that bed frame.

468
00:20:37,922 --> 00:20:40,622
Oh, don't mind me. I'm just...
I'm a sucker for antiques.

469
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,458
I like things with a little bit of history.

470
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,494
She's a little unfocused.

471
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,143
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

472
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,179
Oh, no, it's all right.
What... what can I do for you?

473
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:07,182
Well, sir, we were told
that this is your work.

474
00:21:07,216 --> 00:21:09,150
Yeah. Yeah, that's mine.

475
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,351
Yeah? Can you remember who you gave it to?

476
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:11,786
Uh... yeah. Yeah. I remember this guy.

477
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,253
He's, uh...

478
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:15,289
he's a nice kid. Uh, quiet. Polite.

479
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:16,857
Um, read a book the whole time.

480
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:18,792
Oh, yeah? Can you tell us who he is?

481
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:21,829
Never got his name. Um...
he had brown hair, though.

482
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,331
Brown hair. Any... anything else?

483
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:25,565
He was big into words. Lot of words.

484
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:28,868
All over his arms, chest, legs.

485
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:31,570
What about you, man? You got any ink?

486
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:35,474
Oh. No. No. I mean, I've always wanted one,

487
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:39,378
but, uh... I'm a dad now.

488
00:21:39,412 --> 00:21:42,381
So... yeah, my son's name is Christian.

489
00:21:42,449 --> 00:21:44,415
We're gonna let you get back to it.

490
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,017
Looks great.

491
00:21:46,052 --> 00:21:48,419
- Bye now.
- Thank you, thank you.

492
00:21:48,454 --> 00:21:51,256
- That was weird.
- Yeah.

493
00:21:54,543 --> 00:21:56,178
Yeah, we should call
the troops and tell them

494
00:21:56,212 --> 00:21:59,314
about our conversation
with Mr. Ink, all right?

495
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:01,748
Uh, brown hair, lots of
words. Maybe... I don't know.

496
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:04,651
Maybe it'll narrow it down a bit.

497
00:22:04,686 --> 00:22:06,620
Don't you think we should
keep this to ourselves?

498
00:22:06,654 --> 00:22:08,856
I mean, I'm kind of looking for
a commendation where I'm a...

499
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,858
- You know, I'm a dad.
- Oh, yeah, Diaz.

500
00:22:10,892 --> 00:22:12,659
You're a dad. You're a dad. I know.

501
00:22:12,694 --> 00:22:15,762
You got kids. I got
kids. Everybody has kids.

502
00:22:15,797 --> 00:22:18,764
Listen, look at me. You
are exactly the same guy

503
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,868
that you have always been, all right?

504
00:22:21,902 --> 00:22:24,337
You gotta stop freaking out about this.

505
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:27,874
Or at least, you gotta
stop talking about it.

506
00:22:30,945 --> 00:22:33,312
1514. I got a couple of
bread crumbs on our guy

507
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:34,713
if anyone's interested.

508
00:22:34,747 --> 00:22:37,615
Good boy. Let's go.

509
00:22:39,953 --> 00:22:41,887
For the record,

510
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:44,323
I'm gonna tell Sam it was
my call to go after Felix.

511
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,725
That's fine, really.

512
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:49,426
I know this isn't a
comfortable situation...

513
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,229
me, being here, the new person.

514
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:54,631
People come and go. Things change.

515
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,869
Yeah, well, I know you're
well-liked and respected.

516
00:22:57,936 --> 00:22:58,870
I'm not trying to replace you.

517
00:22:58,904 --> 00:23:02,306
I know that.

518
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:05,308
- So time to move on.
- I have moved on.

519
00:23:05,236 --> 00:23:09,072
I mean, moving on to the
guy you want to track down.

520
00:23:09,107 --> 00:23:10,573
- What's his name? Nicky...
- Nicky Radar.

521
00:23:10,608 --> 00:23:12,308
Nicky Radar.

522
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:13,977
I think we should at least rule him out.

523
00:23:14,045 --> 00:23:16,679
So it says his last known
address was Queen East.

524
00:23:16,748 --> 00:23:18,181
Do you wanna start with his house?

525
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:19,849
- Sure.
- 1504,

526
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,617
I need you to head back to 2923 Gerrard.

527
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,053
There's another 9-1-1
call regarding your EDP.

528
00:23:24,121 --> 00:23:25,587
Crap.

529
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:28,290
It's Wanda.

530
00:23:28,358 --> 00:23:29,959
We're on our way.

531
00:23:32,462 --> 00:23:34,730
Wanda?

532
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:36,330
You in there?

533
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:44,806
You said you knew this woman.

534
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,543
Yeah, and you said she'd be fine.

535
00:23:57,518 --> 00:23:59,218
I'm gonna check the
stairwell, go down to the exit.

536
00:23:59,252 --> 00:24:01,487
I'll check in with her neighbors.

537
00:24:03,356 --> 00:24:04,823
She's not a bad person.

538
00:24:04,891 --> 00:24:06,625
I never said she was a bad person.

539
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,192
Okay? I asked you if
she'd be okay on her own,

540
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,461
and you said yes.

541
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:18,302
Hello? Is anyone home?

542
00:24:26,377 --> 00:24:28,579
Hello. It's Officer Cruz. Is anyone home?

543
00:24:28,613 --> 00:24:30,047
Mr. Smith, are you there?

544
00:24:31,115 --> 00:24:33,316
Hello?

545
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:35,552
Police. It's Officer Cruz.

546
00:24:45,228 --> 00:24:47,363
1504. I need backup to
Willow Creek, apartment 607.

547
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:49,298
I'm with a victim of a stabbing.

548
00:24:49,332 --> 00:24:51,233
He's still breathing, but
he's lost a lot of blood.

549
00:24:51,268 --> 00:24:53,936
This is 1514. We're on our way.

550
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,771
Sir? Sir?

551
00:24:59,943 --> 00:25:01,309
Stairwell's clear.

552
00:25:01,343 --> 00:25:02,945
Be careful, McNally.

553
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:05,948
I found the neighbor down.
It may have been our EDP.

554
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,454
Hello?

555
00:25:18,126 --> 00:25:20,461
I need it on.

556
00:25:20,495 --> 00:25:22,362
- Wanda, what's going on?
- People are hateful!

557
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,699
People do not have the
right to look down on me

558
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,366
or laugh in my face, spit in my face.

559
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,702
I am human like everyone else.

560
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:32,072
These brats don't even know me.

561
00:25:32,106 --> 00:25:33,940
I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.

562
00:25:33,975 --> 00:25:36,309
But you're not sorry. You're not sorry.

563
00:25:36,343 --> 00:25:38,712
You throw stuff at me. You call me names.

564
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:41,947
- You laugh in my face. Oh, life is so fun for Dylan.
- You gotta let him go, Wanda.

565
00:25:42,015 --> 00:25:43,983
- I won't do it anymore.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

566
00:25:50,957 --> 00:25:53,325
You can't tase me.

567
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,960
You can't tase me now, or I'll blow up.

568
00:25:55,995 --> 00:25:57,561
I'm not doing anything.

569
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,396
I don't have a weapon. I know my rights.

570
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:00,665
I know my rights.

571
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:03,935
Okay. Okay.

572
00:26:03,969 --> 00:26:07,505
But you have to come with me now.

573
00:26:08,974 --> 00:26:10,307
Don't! Please don't. Don't.

574
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,042
Please don't bring no
cop down here, please.

575
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,944
Please. I'll listen to
you. I know you, okay?

576
00:26:14,012 --> 00:26:17,247
Yeah. W... we're friends,
right? Right? Right?

577
00:26:17,314 --> 00:26:19,081
Okay, just give me a
minute to calm down, okay?

578
00:26:19,116 --> 00:26:21,284
- Just give me a minute.
- Then you need to let the boy go,

579
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:22,985
and you're gonna come with
me. All right, we're just gonna

580
00:26:23,053 --> 00:26:25,421
go for a little walk. Do you understand?

581
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:28,924
- Please. I just wanna go home.
- I know. We're gonna get you outta he soon.

582
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:32,962
- Oh, he's the victim, right? And I'm the bad guy.
- No, but he's a kid,

583
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,463
and he probably didn't
mean to be that rude.

584
00:26:34,497 --> 00:26:35,997
He's a little snot, and he's gonna grow up

585
00:26:36,065 --> 00:26:38,267
to be a bigger snot
unless he learns better.

586
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:41,936
Wanda... we need to get
this under control right now.

587
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:44,306
Okay?

588
00:26:44,374 --> 00:26:47,442
This looks really bad on me, too.

589
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,010
I vouched for you.

590
00:26:51,547 --> 00:26:53,147
Okay.

591
00:26:55,551 --> 00:26:58,152
I'll let him go...

592
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,389
if you tell me the truth.

593
00:27:01,456 --> 00:27:05,359
Am I going to have to
go back to the hospital?

594
00:27:05,427 --> 00:27:06,560
Why don't we go back to your apartment

595
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:08,461
and we'll talk about it?

596
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:10,330
Hey, we searched every
floor. We can't find her.

597
00:27:10,364 --> 00:27:12,932
Sir, sir, have you got any
idea where she might be?

598
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,367
I know where she should be.

599
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:16,169
She should be in the mental ward.

600
00:27:16,237 --> 00:27:18,605
Cruz, I'm with Wanda in the basement.

601
00:27:18,673 --> 00:27:20,273
- I could use some help.
- Can you stay with him?

602
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:22,075
I can go. No, she's my partner.

603
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:23,509
Okay, go.

604
00:27:23,543 --> 00:27:25,911
It's all over now.

605
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:29,948
I really liked having my
own apartment, you know?

606
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:33,118
I was doing good. I was really good.

607
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,554
I'm not a bad person.

608
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:37,556
McNally, where in the basement?

609
00:27:37,591 --> 00:27:39,691
- Don't. Don't! Don't say anything, please.
- I have to.

610
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,926
No. No. No.

611
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,194
We're in the superintendant's room,

612
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,230
down the south end of the basement.

613
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,064
Shut up! I said shut up! Get out! Shut up!

614
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,399
Put it down.

615
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:50,201
- Shut up!
- Put it down.

616
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:51,869
- I can't stay in here anymore!
- Wanda, no!

617
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:12,889
I had it covered. I was dealing with it.

618
00:28:12,923 --> 00:28:14,190
I knew her.

619
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,659
It was exactly why I was talking her down.

620
00:28:16,693 --> 00:28:18,561
She was listening to me. It's
just the kid startled her.

621
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:21,097
- Why wasn't your gun out?
- I was about to draw.

622
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,899
I drew first.

623
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:24,500
You know what? You have been
second-guessing me all day.

624
00:28:24,534 --> 00:28:26,369
- I've been trying to manage it.
- Hey.

625
00:28:26,403 --> 00:28:28,737
Hey.

626
00:28:31,174 --> 00:28:32,574
You guys got your stories straight?

627
00:28:32,608 --> 00:28:34,442
'Cause S.I.U.'s gonna be all over this.

628
00:28:34,477 --> 00:28:36,411
There's no story. She
was following protocol.

629
00:28:36,445 --> 00:28:38,013
She just got there first.

630
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:40,282
Shaw, take Cruz back to the station.

631
00:28:40,316 --> 00:28:41,917
Diaz, take McNally.

632
00:28:41,951 --> 00:28:43,951
Keep them separated
until they talk to S.I.U.

633
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:55,611
Well, I wish I knew your name.

634
00:28:55,645 --> 00:28:59,014
Yeah, everyone needs a name, even in death.

635
00:29:00,383 --> 00:29:02,250
Even in your urn.

636
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,557
How about I call you... Urnie?

637
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:09,991
Hey, Urnie.

638
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:12,660
I know.

639
00:29:12,728 --> 00:29:14,662
Being ashes...

640
00:29:14,697 --> 00:29:19,934
stuck in your urn with no one to love you.

641
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:22,704
That must really suck.

642
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:26,173
But at least you don't
have to drink this tea.

643
00:29:29,377 --> 00:29:31,144
Ahh.

644
00:29:31,212 --> 00:29:33,547
- All right, it's not Miguel.
- Sure isn't.

645
00:29:33,614 --> 00:29:35,248
It's not Felix. It's not Steve Haddock.

646
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,351
He has red hair, so we're
basically down to what,

647
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:38,618
four guys?

648
00:29:38,686 --> 00:29:41,388
Okay. Um...

649
00:29:41,422 --> 00:29:43,689
Beavertail's got a few
B&Es, violent history.

650
00:29:43,757 --> 00:29:45,290
Oh, and check this out.

651
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,960
In '05, he was charged
with indecent exposure.

652
00:29:48,027 --> 00:29:50,529
He dropped his pants in night school.

653
00:29:50,564 --> 00:29:53,298
He's in Jamestown. Let's go check it out.

654
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:55,735
Um... wait. Where does Nicky Radar live?

655
00:29:57,537 --> 00:30:03,074
Lowney Avenue. Okay, so
that's Queen and Carlaw.

656
00:30:03,141 --> 00:30:04,576
- What?
- Ah. I don't know.

657
00:30:04,643 --> 00:30:06,310
Jamestown doesn't have antique stores.

658
00:30:06,379 --> 00:30:08,613
But Queen East has some
great little stores.

659
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:11,082
We're not going after a
guy so you can go antiquing.

660
00:30:11,149 --> 00:30:13,718
No, Dov. All the A.T.M.s this guy hits

661
00:30:13,786 --> 00:30:16,387
are in neighborhoods with
cool little antique shops.

662
00:30:16,454 --> 00:30:18,522
So? Coincidence.

663
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,457
Well, maybe, but the
one that we're at today

664
00:30:20,525 --> 00:30:22,793
had a "cash only" sign in the window.

665
00:30:22,827 --> 00:30:25,128
So people have to go to nearby A.T.M.s

666
00:30:25,196 --> 00:30:26,530
in order to get cash?

667
00:30:26,598 --> 00:30:28,665
Exactly, because antiques aren't cheap.

668
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:30,300
I mean, would Beavertail know this?

669
00:30:30,368 --> 00:30:32,167
I don't know. His name's Beavertail.

670
00:30:32,202 --> 00:30:35,004
- Probably doesn't know much.
- Ha! You're so right.

671
00:30:36,707 --> 00:30:38,474
Okay, well, let's go to Queen East then.

672
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:40,543
All right, but if you
look inside a store window,

673
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:42,244
I'm writing you up.

674
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:44,714
Relax, okay?

675
00:30:47,249 --> 00:30:49,250
Well, well, well.

676
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:51,426
Don't you have it easy today.

677
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:52,861
Kinda look like a secretary.

678
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:54,329
Oh, yeah? You got it so tough back there,

679
00:30:54,364 --> 00:30:56,064
babysitting bicycles?

680
00:30:56,098 --> 00:30:58,533
I am babysitting human ashes.

681
00:30:58,601 --> 00:30:59,901
Uh, I tracked down ashes' family.

682
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:03,404
Urnie's family? I mean, the urn.

683
00:31:03,438 --> 00:31:04,938
What'd you find?

684
00:31:04,973 --> 00:31:06,574
His name is Roy Power.

685
00:31:06,608 --> 00:31:08,442
Tracked down his nephew in Hawaii.

686
00:31:08,477 --> 00:31:10,544
Roy left his wife for a much younger woman

687
00:31:10,612 --> 00:31:13,314
and lost contact with the whole family.

688
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:15,215
And his new wife died of
a heart attack last year.

689
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,451
So urn's heading to Hawaii?

690
00:31:17,486 --> 00:31:21,053
- Well, I'm suddenly jealous of ashes right now.
- They don't want him.

691
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,590
What do you... what do... what do you mean?

692
00:31:23,624 --> 00:31:25,091
They said we could flush him.

693
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:28,961
- Just... flush him?
- Yeah, or whatever.

694
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:32,332
- What if other relatives show up?
- I don't think there are any other relatives.

695
00:31:32,366 --> 00:31:35,601
So you're just gonna
flush him down the toilet?

696
00:31:35,635 --> 00:31:37,403
Well, we could leave him
on the shelf back there.

697
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,038
- For eternity?
- I don't know, Gail.

698
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:41,307
You're working the property room.

699
00:31:41,341 --> 00:31:44,009
You decide. Okay?

700
00:31:44,043 --> 00:31:46,244
15 Division.

701
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,948
Okay, ma'am, that's not
a call for the police.

702
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,050
Hello?

703
00:31:53,084 --> 00:31:55,787
He lives in an art gallery?

704
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:57,789
- I'm so jelly.
- I see that.

705
00:31:57,823 --> 00:31:59,089
I'm not window shopping.

706
00:31:59,124 --> 00:32:01,158
Hello?

707
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:04,995
Ah. Hey, officers.

708
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,431
Uh, sorry about the mess.

709
00:32:06,498 --> 00:32:07,998
Are you Nicky Radar?

710
00:32:08,066 --> 00:32:10,267
Uh, yes, I am. Is there a problem?

711
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:12,169
Looks like you got a lot of tattoos there.

712
00:32:12,204 --> 00:32:14,938
Yep. Guilty... of following the trends.

713
00:32:14,972 --> 00:32:16,473
Who doesn't have one these days?

714
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:18,575
Can you tell us where you
were last night at 11:00 P.M.?

715
00:32:18,643 --> 00:32:20,577
Yeah, I was here. I had some friends over.

716
00:32:20,611 --> 00:32:23,580
We were playing some music,
had a bit of a jam session.

717
00:32:23,614 --> 00:32:25,982
They can vouch for me.

718
00:32:26,016 --> 00:32:27,984
How about this afternoon, around 3:00?

719
00:32:28,052 --> 00:32:30,486
This afternoon I was actually
right across the street,

720
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,122
getting my hair cut with my friend Stewart.

721
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:35,524
You got you hair cut today?

722
00:32:35,592 --> 00:32:37,460
Yeah. I got, like, 5 inches taken off.

723
00:32:37,494 --> 00:32:39,127
It feels weird.

724
00:32:39,162 --> 00:32:40,663
Your barber can verify this?

725
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:42,798
Oh, yeah. We can head
over there if you want.

726
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:45,467
That's not necessary.
Thank you for your time.

727
00:32:45,534 --> 00:32:46,934
You have a good day.

728
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:48,936
All right, guys. Thank you very much.

729
00:32:56,278 --> 00:32:58,179
If his alibi holds up, we've lost an hour.

730
00:32:58,213 --> 00:32:59,414
You know, we should have
gone after Beavertail

731
00:32:59,482 --> 00:33:01,048
while we were in his neighborhood.

732
00:33:04,085 --> 00:33:06,553
Great.

733
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:12,225
Dov, look.

734
00:33:28,642 --> 00:33:31,844
Nice try. Hey, you going somewhere?

735
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:34,579
- Life is beautiful, isn't it, Nicky?
- What are you talking about?

736
00:33:34,614 --> 00:33:37,081
You're gonna have to come with us.

737
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:38,884
You guys serious?

738
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:41,252
Or you could save us some
time and show us your butt.

739
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:43,988
If you don't have a tattoo,
we'll let you go right now.

740
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:51,395
That's what we thought.

741
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,030
Thank you, Officer Price.

742
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,433
Hands up against the wall, please.

743
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,867
Now.

744
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,907
Come on.

745
00:34:14,461 --> 00:34:16,096
Sorry.

746
00:34:16,164 --> 00:34:18,498
I didn't know you were in here.

747
00:34:20,534 --> 00:34:24,736
How'd it go with S.I.U.?

748
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,971
Yeah. Great.

749
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:29,008
I had to repeat every step a dozen times,

750
00:34:29,042 --> 00:34:31,977
but... it's fine.

751
00:34:32,012 --> 00:34:33,879
Well, they say she might pull through.

752
00:34:33,914 --> 00:34:41,752
Yeah. I guess that's the good news.

753
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:43,254
What do you want, McNally?

754
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,194
Just to say thank you...

755
00:34:49,228 --> 00:34:51,595
for having my back.

756
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,464
Doing your job.

757
00:34:55,634 --> 00:34:59,970
You were just... doing your job.

758
00:35:28,064 --> 00:35:29,097
Gail, what's up?

759
00:35:29,131 --> 00:35:31,900
Nothing. Just going home.

760
00:35:31,934 --> 00:35:33,401
With the urn?

761
00:35:33,435 --> 00:35:35,370
Yeah. I thought I would drop him off first.

762
00:35:35,404 --> 00:35:38,039
- Where?
- I was thinking maybe the lake.

763
00:35:38,074 --> 00:35:39,807
You are so sweet.

764
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:41,409
Oh, don't be stupid. It's
not even out of the way.

765
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:43,144
It's the same as flushing
him down the toilet,

766
00:35:43,212 --> 00:35:47,181
only it's a prettier,
bigger toilet. So what?

767
00:35:47,215 --> 00:35:48,983
I'll go with you.

768
00:35:55,056 --> 00:35:56,723
Chloe.

769
00:35:56,758 --> 00:35:57,824
Good work today.

770
00:35:57,893 --> 00:36:01,261
Thanks. You, too. Right here.

771
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:04,797
Okay. Uh... I'll see you tomorrow.

772
00:36:04,865 --> 00:36:07,800
Uh, wait. Um...

773
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:11,104
it felt good today, working with you.

774
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:13,472
It felt like... I don't know.

775
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:17,075
I had a partner who appreciated me.

776
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:18,977
You treated me like a normal cop.

777
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:22,314
Really? 'Cause today was
one of the most abnormal days

778
00:36:22,382 --> 00:36:23,382
I've ever had.

779
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:26,251
Oh. Okay.

780
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:27,619
It wasn't bad.

781
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:28,921
So it was good?

782
00:36:28,988 --> 00:36:30,322
It... was different.

783
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,990
Well, I think that we make a great team.

784
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,292
We caught the bad guy.

785
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,327
That's right.

786
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,364
Um...

787
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,700
Do you wanna... get a drink?

788
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:47,171
Okay.

789
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,939
You're Frank's goddaughter.

790
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,142
All right, I can't do
anything to screw that up.

791
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:53,376
Okay.

792
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,245
Plus right now my ears... they need a rest.

793
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:58,048
No offense, but... you talk a lot.

794
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:00,450
Okay.

795
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,054
You know what I didn't
hear in that statement?

796
00:37:05,088 --> 00:37:06,721
A "no."

797
00:37:06,756 --> 00:37:08,457
Well, the "no" was implied.

798
00:37:08,524 --> 00:37:12,394
But not clearly stated.

799
00:37:12,462 --> 00:37:15,097
See you tomorrow... Doive.

800
00:37:39,253 --> 00:37:42,055
Roy Power.

801
00:37:44,325 --> 00:37:46,426
Washing away in the water is better

802
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:49,062
than rotting away on some shelf.

803
00:37:49,097 --> 00:37:51,865
- Gail, away from the wind. Away from the wind.
- Crap.

804
00:37:51,899 --> 00:37:54,233
Ah, Roy, I'm sorry.

805
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:55,701
Wow.

806
00:37:55,735 --> 00:37:58,837
That's a lot of ashes.

807
00:37:58,872 --> 00:38:00,239
I take it Roy wasn't a small man.

808
00:38:04,378 --> 00:38:08,279
What if wasn't... just Roy in that urn?

809
00:38:09,882 --> 00:38:12,083
What if when his second wife died,

810
00:38:12,118 --> 00:38:15,520
she had her ashes dumped in with his

811
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:17,188
so the two of them
could be blended together

812
00:38:17,223 --> 00:38:21,692
into a pile of... indistinguishable dust?

813
00:38:21,727 --> 00:38:23,928
That's a weird thought.

814
00:38:23,962 --> 00:38:26,196
Yeah, well, that's what
some people want, you know?

815
00:38:26,231 --> 00:38:29,500
They... wanna be bonded
together as one unit,

816
00:38:29,534 --> 00:38:32,136
sharing in all of each
other's ups and downs.

817
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:35,039
And I know it's crazy, and I would never...

818
00:38:35,073 --> 00:38:37,707
I would never ask that of us, but it...

819
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:40,410
there's just something
kind of romantic about it.

820
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:42,278
Gail, just give me the damn drink.

821
00:39:00,396 --> 00:39:01,897
- Let it go down. Just let it go.
- Oh, God.

822
00:39:01,932 --> 00:39:03,698
Swallow it. Let it travel.

823
00:39:03,766 --> 00:39:05,967
That is vile.

824
00:39:06,001 --> 00:39:08,036
Ohh. Thank you.

825
00:39:12,942 --> 00:39:15,743
Thank you so much.

826
00:39:31,926 --> 00:39:35,361
You sure you don't want
me to take you home?

827
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:38,497
Yeah. I'm sure. Don't worry.

828
00:39:38,565 --> 00:39:41,300
Call me if you need me.

829
00:39:41,334 --> 00:39:44,203
Yeah.

830
00:39:52,377 --> 00:39:54,112
Thanks. Thank you.

831
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:19,036
She's great.

832
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:23,406
Is that your talent, McNally?

833
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:24,607
Pointing out the obvious.

834
00:40:24,642 --> 00:40:30,246
No. I know when to quit.

835
00:40:31,481 --> 00:40:34,050
That's my talent.

836
00:40:34,084 --> 00:40:35,785
I know when the odds are against me

837
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:38,921
and when to walk away.

838
00:40:40,422 --> 00:40:42,457
Good night, Sam.

839
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:44,026
Andy.

840
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,061
Andy?

841
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,333
See you tomorrow.

842
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,304
