00:14:26,254 --> 00:14:27,754
I don't know--
'cause it's hard

326
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:29,589
to find a mountain in Florida?

327
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:37,597
There are mountains
in South America.

328
00:14:37,598 --> 00:14:39,433
All over the place.

329
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,104
Why are you
looking at me like that?

330
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:54,180
Or is that just your face?

331
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:56,315
Uhh.

332
00:14:56,316 --> 00:14:59,650
I should never have
left Saxon alive.

It's not your fault.

334
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,758
Clayton fucked everything up.

335
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,727
Bad luck.

336
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:12,630
No, it's more than that.

337

Ever since you found out
who I am...

338
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:26,843
I've screwed up your life, Deb.

339
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:32,115
It's not yours
to screw up, Dexter.

340
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:34,083
I am responsible for my life.

341
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:35,618
Do you hear me?

342
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:42,225
I don't want you to feel guilty
about this.

343
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:43,892
I don't want you to feel
guilty about anything.

344
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:45,527

00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:49,164
You were meant to be happy,

347
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:51,666
so you need to go

Hello there.

351
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,575
Dr. Kruper.

352
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,075
Uh, Dexter.
I'm Debra's brother.

353
00:16:02,076 --> 00:16:04,145
Ah, nice to meet you.

354
00:16:04,146 --> 00:16:08,282
Okay, just gonna
check your stomach.

355
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:11,552
So how are you feeling
otherwise?

356
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,387
I wanna go hiking.

357
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:15,256
- [Tearful chuckle]
- I wouldn't recommend that

358
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:17,757
for at least a few hours.

359
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:19,292
How is she?

360
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:21,927
That bullet
bounced around quite a bit.

361
00:16:21,928 --> 00:16:24,230
But it missed hitting
anything important.

362
00:16:24,231 --> 00:16:25,731
You are very lucky.

363
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:28,000
So she's gonna be all right?

364
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:30,370
There is a lot of recovery
time ahead.

365
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:33,839
But...I'd say
we're looking pretty good.

366
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,440
I'm optimistic.

367
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:36,776
Thank you.

368
00:16:36,777 --> 00:16:38,510
Mm-hmm.

I bet Hannah loves Argentina.

Pretty blonde,
lots of attention.

372
00:16:52,659 --> 00:16:54,926
Just her thing.

373
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:58,697
Hannah didn't make the flight.

374
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:03,402
Elway was there,
and we had to lose him.

375
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:04,403
That's my fault, Dex.

376
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:07,138
I put him on her.

377
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:10,709
That rat-face fuck.
I'm--

378
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,976
I'm sorry.

379
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:14,145
No, don't start
blaming yourself.

380
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:17,682
Coming from Mr. "I Screwed Up
Your Life, Deb."

381
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:23,187
I need to find another way

382
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:28,892
for Hannah to get
out of the country.

383
00:17:28,893 --> 00:17:31,361
I'm thinking of sending
Harrison with her now,

384
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:33,964
and meeting up with them
after you get out

385
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:36,399
and Saxon is taken care of.

386
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,668
You heard the doctor.
I'm fine.

387
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:40,302
You should go.
We'll get Saxon.

388
00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:42,471
- No.
- Dex, we'll get him.

389
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:45,208
Your life is waiting on you.
You should leave.

390
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:46,642
Deb...

391
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:49,511
The next word I want
to hear you say is good-bye.

392
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:52,849
- [Scoffs]
- Say it already,

393
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:57,285
or I'll crawl out of this bed
and kick your fuckin' ass.

394
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:01,522
Good-bye.

395
00:18:01,523 --> 00:18:04,059
I'll see you soon.

[Indistinct P.A. announcement]

397

How's Aunt Deb?
Can see her?

398
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:26,413
Ah, she needs to rest.

399
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:30,583
But she's gonna visit us
real soon.

this is the hospital

- Yeah.

Right down there.

It's the first time I saw you.

405
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:44,529
I was with Aunt Deb.

406
00:18:49,702 --> 00:18:52,204
Holy fuckin' shit.
There's another Morgan now.

land on a name yet?

- Uh, he's sleeping.

fuckin' life to sleep.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

448
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,803
That's why Clayton
was following Deb.

449
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:39,505
He figured she was helping you
and Hannah leave the country.

450
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:40,773
And if that's true,
I guess you know

you're partially responsible
for his death.

but the buses
have their own lanes,

654
00:31:29,682 --> 00:31:31,216
I don't know how to do this.

655
00:31:31,217 --> 00:31:32,683
Just keep his head up.

656
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:35,120
No, I mean everything.

657
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:37,422
How to be a father,
how to take care of him.

658
00:31:37,423 --> 00:31:38,789
You'll be great.

659
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,358
How do you know?

660
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:42,093
'Cause you've always
taken care of me.

661
00:31:42,094 --> 00:31:44,595
I have?

662
00:31:44,596 --> 00:31:47,498
Ever since we were little.

663
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:48,932
Don't you remember
the monsters?

664
00:31:51,102 --> 00:31:52,269
Uh, no.

665
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,904
Every time mom would
turn off the lights,

666
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:55,772
they'd be running
all over the walls.

667
00:31:55,773 --> 00:31:57,541
And I couldn't fuckin'
go to sleep

668
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,676
'cause I thought they were gonna
eat me or something.

669
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:01,745

670
00:32:01,746 --> 00:32:04,347
They were the shadows.

671
00:32:04,348 --> 00:32:07,017
You came in and explained it
in your dorky little voice.

672
00:32:07,018 --> 00:32:09,485
You were like, "Oh, it's just
the absence of light, Deb."

673
00:32:09,486 --> 00:32:11,955
[Both chuckle]

674

I don't even know
why I remember that,

675
00:32:13,624 --> 00:32:15,091
but I do.

676
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:19,728
And even then,
you stayed in my room

677
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,098
and slept on the floor
by my bed.

678
00:32:24,168 --> 00:32:26,302
You made me feel
so fuckin' safe.

679
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:29,805
You were always
taking care of me.

680
00:32:29,806 --> 00:32:31,174
I know you're gonna
be a great father,

681
00:32:31,175 --> 00:32:33,909
because you've always been
a great big brother.

682
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,644
You really believe that?

683
00:32:36,645 --> 00:32:38,547
With all my heart.

684
00:32:47,656 --> 00:32:49,824
You were so wrong, Deb.

685
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:02,869
Tell me about Argentina.

686
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,238
Well, uh...

687
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:07,373
they have their own special
kind of cowboys.

688
00:33:07,374 --> 00:33:10,577
They're called gauchos.
Maybe you'll get to meet one.

689
00:33:10,578 --> 00:33:13,246
You know what else they have?

690
00:33:13,247 --> 00:33:14,547
Penguins.

691
00:33:14,548 --> 00:33:15,715
I like penguins.

692
00:33:15,716 --> 00:33:17,250
But not just in a zoo,

693
00:33:17,251 --> 00:33:19,952
they're wild ones,
kind of roaming around.

694
00:33:19,953 --> 00:33:24,889
'Cause Argentina is close
to the South Pole,

695
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:28,627
which is where Santa Claus
has his summer home, and...

696
00:33:31,297 --> 00:33:33,599
and...because
he's on vacation,

697
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,234
he's always in a good mood.

698
00:33:35,235 --> 00:33:37,969
So he says yes to everything.

699
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:41,672
Who knew you'd be
so good with kids, huh?

How did you find me?

701
00:33:43,308 --> 00:33:46,977
One of my contacts
finally came through.

702
00:33:46,978 --> 00:33:49,013
Look, let's be civil
about this, all right?

703
00:33:49,014 --> 00:33:51,382
No need to upset Harrison.

704
00:33:51,383 --> 00:33:53,251
All right, everyone,
please take your seats.

705
00:33:53,252 --> 00:33:54,685
We're going out now.

706

Next stop, Daytona.

707
00:33:58,222 --> 00:34:01,291
So this is what's gonna happen.

708
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:03,527
We're gonna sit here quietly
until we get to Daytona.

709
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:06,863
Then we're gonna very calmly
get off the bus.

710
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:09,299
I'm gonna drive us
to the marshal's field office.

711
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,933
I'm gonna turn you in,
and I'm gonna hand Harrison

712
00:34:10,934 --> 00:34:14,703
over to Child
Protective Services.

713
00:34:14,704 --> 00:34:16,639
And I'm gonna collect
what's turning out to be

714
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,677
a very hard-earned reward.

715

Dex, we're gonna nail
this asshole to the wall.

You know, there are several
ways we can do this.

721
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:57,311
Given that we have footage
of you killing other people,

722
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:58,378
it would be
in your best interest

723
00:34:58,379 --> 00:35:00,213
to cooperate.

724
00:35:00,214 --> 00:35:02,114
It's up to my lawyer
how cooperative I am.

725

Are you sure?

726
00:35:03,116 --> 00:35:04,817
Because if you have any hope

727
00:35:04,818 --> 00:35:06,285
of staying out
of the electric chair,

728
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:08,354
you should probably
start talking.

Just fuckin' admit it.

You killed Cassie,
you killed Clayton.

And you shot Deb.

And you left her there to die!

to make a case against Saxon.

kill him.

820

was handled perfectly--
