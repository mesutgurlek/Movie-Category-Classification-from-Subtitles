1
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:31,039
What do you call yourself?

2
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:36,198
Antonio Montana.
And you, what you call yourself?

3
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:39,320
- Where'd you learn English, Tony?
- In school.

4
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:42,727
And my father,
he was from the United States.

5
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:45,165
Just like you, you know?

6
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:49,960
He was a Yankee.
He used to take me a lot to the movies.

7
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:54,519
I learned. I watch the guys
like Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney...

8
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:59,881
They teach me to talk. I like those guys.

9
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:03,357
I always know one day
I'm coming here, United States.

10
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:07,036
- So where's your old man now?
- He dead. He die.

11
00:04:07,287 --> 00:04:09,243
Sometime. Somewhere.

12
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:11,443
- Mother?
- She dead, too.

13
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:14,559
- What kind of work you do in Cuba?
- You know, things.

14
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:19,562
I was, this, that. Construction business.

15
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:23,525
I work a lot with my hands.
I was in the Army.

16
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,645
Any family in the States?
Cousins, brother-in-law, anyone?

17
00:04:26,727 --> 00:04:29,719
Nobody. Everybody's dead.

18
00:04:30,047 --> 00:04:35,599
- You ever been to jail, Tony?
- Me? Jail? No way, no.

19
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:39,925
- Been in a mental hospital?
- Yeah. On the boat coming over.

20
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:44,199
What about homosexuality, Tony?
You like men?

21
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,279
You like to dress up like a woman?

22
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,835
What is wrong with this guy?
He kidding me or what?

23
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:52,077
Just answer the questions, Tony.

24
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:56,280
Okay. No. Fuck, no!

25
00:04:57,007 --> 00:05:00,158
Arrested for vagrancy? Marijuana?

26
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:01,806
- Never, man.
- Heroin?

27
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:04,242
- Cocaine?
- No.

28
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:09,124
Where'd you get the beauty scar,
tough guy? Eating pussy?

29
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,281
How am I gonna get a scar like that
eating pussy?

30
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,722
This was when I was a kid, you know?

31
00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:20,839
You should see the other kid.
You can't recognize him.

32
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:22,076
And this?

33
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:25,236
What? That's nothing.
That's for my sweetheart.

34
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:28,683
Sweetheart, my ass! We've been
seeing more and more of these.

35
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:31,316
Some kind of code
these guys used in the can.

36
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:33,796
Pitchfork means an assassin or something.

37
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:38,244
You want to tell us about it, or you want
to take a trip to the detention center?

38
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:42,122
Okay, you got me.

39
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:45,962
I was in the can one time.
For buying dollars. Big deal.

40
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:49,841
- That's pretty funny, Tony.
- That's true. It was a Canadian tourist.

41
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:52,317
Did you mug him first?
Get him out of here!

42
00:05:52,407 --> 00:05:54,284
- Come on!
- So I fuck up!

43
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:57,884
Let me talk to this guy. Please!
Let me talk to him a minute.

44
00:05:57,967 --> 00:05:59,241
You a Communist?

45
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:03,360
How'd you like it?

46
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:07,156
They tell you all the time what to do,
what to think, what to feel.

47
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:10,557
Do you want to be like a sheep?
Like all those other people?

48
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:12,679
I don't have to listen to this!

49
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:16,646
You wanna work 8, 10 fucking hours?
You own nothing, you got nothing!

50
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:21,483
Do you want a chivato on every corner
watching everything you do?

51
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,159
Everything you say, man?

52
00:06:23,847 --> 00:06:25,883
You know I eat octopus three times a day?

53
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,242
I got fucking octopus
coming out of my ears.

54
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:31,524
I got fucking Russian shoes
my feet's coming through.

55
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:33,526
How'd you like that?

56
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:36,601
You want me to stay there
and do nothing?

57
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,918
I'm no fucking criminal, man.
I'm no puta or thief.

58
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:44,006
I'm Tony Montana,
a political prisoner from Cuba.

59
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:46,766
And I want
my fucking human rights, now!

60
00:06:46,847 --> 00:06:49,759
Just like President Jimmy Carter says.
Okay?

61
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:53,805
Carter should see this human right.
He's really good.

62
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:56,560
- What do you say?
- I don't believe a word of this shit!

63
00:06:56,647 --> 00:07:00,686
They all sound alike to me.
That Castro is shitting all over us.

64
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:03,565
Send the bastard to Freedomtown.
Let them see him.

65
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:05,638
- Get him out of here.
- You know something?

66
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,037
You can send me anywhere.
Here, there, this, that. It don't matter.

67
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:11,800
There's nothing you can do to me
that Castro hasn't done.

68
00:07:11,887 --> 00:07:13,366
Get him out of here!

69
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:18,156
- So?
- So?

70
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:20,078
What'd you tell them?

71
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:24,718
I told them what you told me to tell them.
Told them we were, I was in sanitation.

72
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:27,525
They didn't go for it.

73
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:29,837
- Sanitation?
- Yeah.

74
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:35,286
I told you to tell them
you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.

75
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:39,006
- Sanitarium. Yeah.
- You didn't tell me that.

76
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:43,797
No, I told you to say you had TB
and you was in a sanitarium.

77
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:45,241
You was cured.

78
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,636
- When did you tell me that?
- You should've kept your mouth shut.

79
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:51,843
They'd think you was a horse
and let you out.

80
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:52,244
Tony! Montana!

81
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:55,236
Tony Montana! Come here.

82
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:58,442
Come here, man. I gotta talk to you.

83
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:00,524
Come on, man. It's important.

84
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,438
- So close, man.
- Come on.

85
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:06,767
- I gotta talk to you.
- Where are you going?

86
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,997
- Leave him alone.
- I got better things to do.

87
00:09:09,087 --> 00:09:11,203
You're chicken, man. You almost made it.

88
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:13,801
Are you ready for some good news?

89
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,925
Sure. What you got, man?

90
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:17,998
We can be outta this place in 30 days.

91
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:21,477
Not only that, but we got a green card
and a job in Miami.

92
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:23,757
Now are we made or are we made, man?

93
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:27,163
What do we gotta do?
Go to Cuba and hit The Beard, or what?

94
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:29,807
- No, man, somebody else.
- You're kidding?

95
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:32,321
- No.
- You're not kidding?

96
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:36,405
Guy named Rebenga, man.
Emilio Rebenga.

97
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:37,602
Rebenga?

98
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:40,956
- I know that name.
- Yeah?

99
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,560
- He's political.
- Yeah.

100
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:46,283
Well, he's coming in here today.
Castro just sprung him.

101
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:50,077
This guy was one of the top dogs
for Fidel in the early days.

102
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:54,560
But Castro felt like he couldn't trust him
anymore and threw him in jail.

103
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:57,845
But while he was on top,
he tortured a few guys to death.

104
00:09:57,927 --> 00:10:02,284
One of the guy's brothers is a rich guy
in Miami now. He wants the favor repaid.

105
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:04,399
That's where we come in.

106
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,163
It's ugly, man.

107
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:10,156
Yeah.

108
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:19,476
You tell your guys in Miami, your friend...

109
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,725
...it'd be a pleasure.

110
00:10:22,127 --> 00:10:24,197
I'd kill a Communist for fun...

111
00:10:24,887 --> 00:10:28,562
...but for a green card,
I gonna carve him up real nice.

112
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:39,878
! Libertad!! Libertad!! Libertad!

113
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,045
From a friend you fucked!

114
00:12:56,487 --> 00:12:58,284
That face. That's nice.

115
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:04,245
- That doesn't look like me.
- That looks pretty, man.

116
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:37,556
Fuck!

117
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:40,957
? Qué paso, man?? Qué pasa, man?

118
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:44,440
Your big shot friend better come up
with something soon.

119
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:46,995
I didn't come to the US
to break my fucking back.

120
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:49,396
He's coming!
What do you want from me?

121
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,481
Fucking thing!

122
00:13:51,807 --> 00:13:55,243
- I told you.
- What's wrong with him?

123
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,205
- What's wrong?
- More ham.

124
00:13:58,487 --> 00:14:00,717
No more meat.
That's the way the sandwich comes!

125
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:14,002
Look at that one. That one in the pink.
She's beautiful.

126
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,759
Look at those titties.

127
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:18,165
Look at that punk with her.

128
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,683
What's he got that I don't have?

129
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:24,764
Well, he's very handsome,
for one thing, you know?

130
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:32,040
I mean, look at the way he dresses.
Come on. That's style...

131
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:35,955
...flash, pizzazz. And a little coke money
doesn't hurt nobody.

132
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:41,961
Look at this.

133
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:44,321
Fucking onions.

134
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,725
I ought to be picking gold from the street.

135
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:56,286
There's two guys
looking for you out there.

136
00:14:58,247 --> 00:15:00,397
That's him, man. That's El mono.
I told you.

137
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:02,125
Don't stay too fucking long.

138
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:04,516
We've got a lot of work to do, so...

139
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:27,559
Waldo, this is my friend, Tony Montana,
I've been telling you about.

140
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:32,038
Tony, that's Omar Suarez
and that's Waldo Rojas over there.

141
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:33,840
I got something for you.

142
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:35,883
Yeah? What do we gotta do?

143
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:39,323
Gotta unload a boat. Marijuana.
45 tons. You get $500 each.

144
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:43,406
- $500? That's great.
- You gotta be kidding.

145
00:15:46,887 --> 00:15:48,115
$500?

146
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,796
Who do you think we are,
baggage handlers?

147
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:57,642
The going rate on a boat
is $ 1,000 a night. You know that.

148
00:15:58,127 --> 00:16:00,402
First you gotta work
your way up to $500, idiot.

149
00:16:00,487 --> 00:16:03,126
After what I did for you in Freedomtown?
What was that?

150
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:05,084
That Rebenga hit
was a game of dominoes?

151
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:07,635
- That was something else.
- Shut up! Take it easy.

152
00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:10,366
What's with this dishwasher, chico?

153
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:13,957
Don't he know we could've got another
space cadet to hit Rebenga cheaper?

154
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:16,322
- $50!
- Then why didn't you?

155
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:19,678
Don't call me no fucking dishwasher,
or I'll kick your monkey ass.

156
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:21,359
Who the fuck are you?

157
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:23,999
You can't do that, man!

158
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:26,282
The Colombians!

159
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:32,283
Okay, all right, big man!

160
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:35,757
You want to make some big bucks?
Let's see how tough you are.

161
00:16:36,047 --> 00:16:38,163
You know something about cocaine?

162
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:44,039
You kidding me or what?

163
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:47,801
There's a bunch of Colombians
coming in Friday.

164
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:51,721
New guys. They say they got
two keys for us for openers.

165
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:55,686
Pure coke. Hotel in Miami Beach.
I want you to go over there.

166
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:58,998
If it's what they say it is,
you pay 'em and bring it back.

167
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,406
Do that, you get $5,000.

168
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:05,043
Go, pay them, bring it back, yeah?

169
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,397
You know how to handle a machine gun?

170
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,523
Yeah, man. We were in the Army.

171
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:16,117
- You gonna need a couple other guys.
- That's no problem.

172
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:20,204
Be at Hector's Bodega at noon Friday.
You get the buy money then.

173
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:25,122
If anything happens to that buy money...

174
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:31,439
...my boss will stick your heads up your
asses faster than a rabbit gets fucked!

175
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:33,116
I'm scared.

176
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,078
- You're pushing your luck.
- Don't worry.

177
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:41,159
- That was dumb.
- You worry too much.

178
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:42,646
You'll have a heart attack.

179
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:45,764
You act like that guy's doing you a favor
or something.

180
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:49,635
- What's this with the Colombians?
- What does it matter?

181
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:53,681
He says "Colombians,"
and you make these eyes...

182
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:56,759
I don't like fucking Colombians! Okay?

183
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:01,357
What you guys doing?
There's a lot of dishes to be washed.

184
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,039
Wash 'em yourself.

185
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:05,356
I retire!

186
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:07,837
What the fuck you gonna do now?

187
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:11,198
- Don't come back here!
- I gotta look after my investment!

188
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:14,484
- Fuck you guys!
- Close the shop!

189
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,127
Look at those tits. She's begging for it.

190
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:35,483
Are you fucking crazy?
She's 103 years old.

191
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:38,124
Not that one, man! That one!

192
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,163
- Which one?
- The young one.

193
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:42,920
Move the fucking car.
We're at a stop sign.

194
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,558
We're just staying loose up here, okay?

195
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:50,957
You gotta stay loose. You can't worry.
You'll have a heart attack.

196
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:55,325
- Just play it cool. Miami Beach.
- Miami Beach!

197
00:19:16,647 --> 00:19:18,797
The money stays in the trunk
'till I come out.

198
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:21,321
You got it? Me, nobody else. Okay.

199
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:25,316
I'm not out in 15 minutes,
something's wrong. Okay?

200
00:19:25,527 --> 00:19:28,678
- Room 9. You ready?
- Sure thing.

201
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:12,476
How's it going, brother?

202
00:20:15,687 --> 00:20:16,676
Come in.

203
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:19,718
What's wrong, man?

204
00:20:26,327 --> 00:20:28,602
Okay. You mind leaving the door open?

205
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,564
So my brother-in-law
sees everything's okay.

206
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,558
Sure. No problem.

207
00:20:34,007 --> 00:20:35,235
No problem.

208
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:39,325
Hello. This is Marta.

209
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:44,880
Marta, hello.

210
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,959
I am Hector.

211
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:50,926
And I am Tony.

212
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,476
So, Omar says you're okay.

213
00:20:57,567 --> 00:21:01,196
Yeah? Good. Omar's okay.

214
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:03,362
Okay.

215
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,076
So, you got the money?

216
00:21:14,527 --> 00:21:15,801
You got the stuff?

217
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:19,436
Sure I have the stuff, but I don't
have it right here with me now.

218
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:21,119
I got it close by.

219
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:27,476
Well, I don't have the money either, man.

220
00:21:29,327 --> 00:21:31,124
I have it close by, too.

221
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:33,963
Where?

222
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:37,036
In the car?

223
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:40,965
- No, not in the car, man.
- No?

224
00:21:41,687 --> 00:21:44,485
How about you?
Where you have your stuff?

225
00:21:47,087 --> 00:21:48,076
Not far.

226
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:59,077
Okay. You want me to come in?
We start over again?

227
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:02,046
Where you from, Tony?

228
00:22:02,127 --> 00:22:05,324
What the fuck difference
does it make where I'm from?

229
00:22:06,687 --> 00:22:08,086
Take it easy, man.

230
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:12,236
I just want to get to know
who I do business with.

231
00:22:12,327 --> 00:22:16,684
You'll know me once you do business
with me and stop fucking around.

232
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:18,237
Okay?

233
00:22:18,727 --> 00:22:20,365
- What's the story?
- Tony!

234
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:33,566
You know, Frog Face,
you just fucked yourself.

235
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:36,636
- You steal from me, you're dead.
- Yeah?

236
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:43,238
You want to give me the cash...

237
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,677
...or do I kill your brother first...

238
00:22:47,487 --> 00:22:49,000
...before I kill you?

239
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:55,682
Why don't you try sticking
your head up your ass? See if it fits.

240
00:22:58,167 --> 00:23:00,442
Yeah? Okay.

241
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,320
Yeah, it's very important.

242
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:27,365
- I understand. Important.
- Thank you.

243
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:32,046
You forecasted an earthquake
in the 3-to-4-point range this morning.

244
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:35,005
We had an earthquake in
the 3-to-4 point range this morning.

245
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:37,476
- I'm impressed.
- Thank you, sir.

246
00:23:37,647 --> 00:23:40,400
However, isn't it rather slender evidence?

247
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:52,924
You have such beautiful skin.

248
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:58,117
I like the way you...

249
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:03,606
I don't what I'm supposed
to do today, but...

250
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:28,156
Antonio, mira!

251
00:24:29,287 --> 00:24:31,118
Watch what happens to your friend.

252
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:34,404
You don't want this to happen to you,
give me the money.

253
00:24:52,887 --> 00:24:54,240
Come on, come on.

254
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:07,396
Now the leg.

255
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:18,601
I'm going. It's time.

256
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:20,843
Let's do it, man. Come on.

257
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:28,158
We're all gonna be all right.

258
00:25:38,807 --> 00:25:40,525
Okay, "Cara cicatriz."

259
00:25:41,447 --> 00:25:43,756
You can die, too.
It makes no difference to me.

260
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,396
Last chance, pendejo!

261
00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:54,275
Fuck you!

262
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:02,155
- You okay?
- Yeah, man. It went in and out.

263
00:27:13,047 --> 00:27:14,958
Okay, take him out of here, quick!

264
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:16,878
Chi Chi! Get the yeyo.

265
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:40,681
- Your turn.
- I kill you!

266
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:41,996
Die!

267
00:27:55,047 --> 00:27:58,562
Hurry up! Get in! Come on. Let's go!

268
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:00,320
Close the door!

269
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:15,523
Bunch of cowboys. Somebody fucked up.

270
00:28:16,047 --> 00:28:18,163
Yeah, well, I'll check it out right away.

271
00:28:18,247 --> 00:28:22,240
You do that, Omar. You do that.

272
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,962
- You still got the money?
- Yeah.

273
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:27,843
And I got the yeyo.

274
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:31,001
- You got the yeyo?
- Yeah, right.

275
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:33,478
- Bring it here.
- Fuck you.

276
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:35,842
I'm taking it to Lopez myself.

277
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:38,116
Not you, me.

278
00:28:56,207 --> 00:28:57,526
Nice fucking guy.

279
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:13,003
Frank Lopez. Tony Montana.

280
00:29:13,087 --> 00:29:16,284
- Tony Montana.
- Mr. Lopez. It's a real pleasure.

281
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:20,246
You can call me Frank. Everybody
calls me Frank. My Little League team.

282
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:23,916
Even the fucking prosecutors
around town, they all call me Frank.

283
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:25,679
- Okay, Frank.
- How are you?

284
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:27,644
Manny Rivera.

285
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:30,282
- He caught one on the job.
- Went right through.

286
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:35,043
We heard about that. Omar, he tells me
great things about you guys.

287
00:29:36,647 --> 00:29:38,285
Well, Omar's okay.

288
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:41,404
Not to mention, of course,
the nice job you did for me.

289
00:29:41,487 --> 00:29:45,002
- That Commie son of a bitch...
- Well, you don't have to mention that.

290
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:47,965
- That was fun.
- That was fun?

291
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:50,481
- Damn right.
- That was fun.

292
00:29:51,767 --> 00:29:53,439
Sometimes it's fun.

293
00:29:54,247 --> 00:29:57,239
What do you want to drink?
Scotch, gin, rum? What do you like?

294
00:29:57,327 --> 00:30:00,319
Gin is fine. Want some? Two gins.

295
00:30:00,607 --> 00:30:03,565
I need a guy with steel in his balls, Tony.

296
00:30:03,647 --> 00:30:07,037
A guy like you. And I need him
around me all the time.

297
00:30:07,127 --> 00:30:10,358
You, Tony and your compadre here.

298
00:30:13,407 --> 00:30:14,760
Here's the stuff.

299
00:30:17,407 --> 00:30:18,442
Two keys.

300
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:22,879
It cost my friend Angel his life.
Here's your money.

301
00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:26,199
My gift to you.

302
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:33,757
I'm sorry about your friend, Tony.

303
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:38,605
If people would do business the right way,
there'd be no fuck-ups like this.

304
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:43,121
Don't think
I don't appreciate the gesture.

305
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:46,005
You're gonna find
you stay loyal in this business...

306
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:49,284
...you're gonna move up.
You're gonna move up fast.

307
00:30:56,407 --> 00:31:00,241
Then you'll find out your biggest problem
is not bringing in the stuff...

308
00:31:00,327 --> 00:31:02,921
...but what to do with all the fucking cash!

309
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:05,798
I hope I have that problem someday.

310
00:31:05,887 --> 00:31:09,562
You're gonna have that problem,
don't worry. Sit down over here.

311
00:31:11,727 --> 00:31:15,515
Where the hell's Elvira?
It's late. Go find her, will you?

312
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,405
Jesus! Fucking broad.

313
00:31:18,487 --> 00:31:22,480
She spends half her life dressing,
the other half, undressing.

314
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:26,003
Gotta get her in between.

315
00:31:26,687 --> 00:31:28,837
- She's coming.
- Yeah.

316
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:31,561
You gotta jump on her
when she's not looking.

317
00:31:31,647 --> 00:31:33,478
That's the best time.

318
00:31:35,887 --> 00:31:37,843
What are you guys doing tonight?

319
00:31:37,927 --> 00:31:40,919
You wanna go to a nice restaurant
with me? You hungry?

320
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:43,036
I could eat a horse.

321
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:46,039
- Okay, they're gonna cook you a horse.
- I'll eat it.

322
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,961
Tell me, where'd they get you?
Right there in the side?

323
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:57,198
It's nothing. It went right through me.
It hit the wall.

324
00:31:57,447 --> 00:31:59,677
I ran out of bullets like an asshole.

325
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:05,239
When I changed the clip, a guy who I
thought I killed wasn't dead and shot me.

326
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:07,638
The guy was behind me. I killed him.

327
00:32:07,727 --> 00:32:11,481
- How many bullets you catch?
- Bullets? One bullet, nine millimeter.

328
00:32:21,687 --> 00:32:25,316
Elvira, where the hell you been?
It's 10:00. I'm starving.

329
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:28,524
You're always hungry.
You should try starving.

330
00:32:29,527 --> 00:32:31,119
Where you going? Come on.

331
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:35,359
Come over here!
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

332
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:39,883
Tony Montana. Elvira.

333
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:44,441
- Hello.
- Manny Rivera. Elvira.

334
00:32:44,607 --> 00:32:48,156
So, there are five of us.
Where are we having dinner?

335
00:32:48,247 --> 00:32:50,602
I thought we'd go to the Babylon Club.

336
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:52,605
- Again?
- Again.

337
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:55,884
You know, Frank, if anyone ever wanted
to assassinate you...

338
00:32:55,967 --> 00:32:58,117
...you wouldn't be too hard to find.

339
00:32:58,207 --> 00:33:01,244
Assassinate me?
Who the hell would want to kill me?

340
00:33:03,287 --> 00:33:05,198
I got nothing but friends!

341
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:09,041
You never know. Maybe the catcher
on your Little League team.

342
00:33:09,607 --> 00:33:13,156
The catcher? That son of a bitch,
he didn't get a base hit all season.

343
00:33:13,247 --> 00:33:14,600
I should kill him!

344
00:34:18,727 --> 00:34:21,878
You know who that is?
Luis and Miguel Echevarria.

345
00:34:23,487 --> 00:34:26,684
They got the biggest distribution setup
from here to Houston...

346
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:28,962
...Tucson, all down that way.

347
00:34:29,087 --> 00:34:30,759
What do you think of that?

348
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:33,756
Look.

349
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:39,157
You see that fat bastard?
That's Nacho Contreras.

350
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,158
El gordo!

351
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:44,000
He's got more cash
than anybody in this place.

352
00:34:44,127 --> 00:34:46,595
He's a real chaza!

353
00:34:50,727 --> 00:34:53,082
You know what a "chaza" is?

354
00:34:53,447 --> 00:34:55,642
No, Frank, you tell me. What is a "chaza"?

355
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,195
It's the Yiddish word for "pig."

356
00:34:58,287 --> 00:35:02,883
The guy wants more than what he needs.
He don't fly straight no more.

357
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:08,121
So, it comes down to one thing,
Tony boy, and you never forget it.

358
00:35:10,047 --> 00:35:12,117
Lesson Number 1:

359
00:35:13,607 --> 00:35:18,442
Don't underestimate
the other guy's greed!

360
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:21,196
Lesson Number 2:

361
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:23,243
Don't get high on your own supply.

362
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,444
That's right. Lesson Number 2:
Don't get high on your own supply.

363
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:29,961
'Course, not everybody follows the rules.

364
00:35:35,287 --> 00:35:37,084
Your champagne, Mr. Lopez.

365
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,806
- That is '64?
- The best, Mr. Lopez.

366
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,197
Omar, you pour it, and you bring
another bottle right away, will you?

367
00:35:46,247 --> 00:35:50,240
$550 for this bottle, Tony.
What do you think of that?

368
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:53,803
- That's pretty good.
- For a bunch of fucking grapes.

369
00:35:56,327 --> 00:36:00,240
So, here's to old friends
and to new friends.

370
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:10,485
How you like it, Tony?

371
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:13,158
- That's good, Frank.
- That's good?

372
00:36:13,247 --> 00:36:15,681
- Like you say, man.
- That's good!

373
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:21,440
I'm gonna get you new clothes, too.

374
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:24,325
I'm gonna get you $550 suits...

375
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:26,759
...so you look real sharp.

376
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:29,797
'Cause I want you to work for me.

377
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:35,085
I want you and your boys
to work with Omar here.

378
00:36:36,087 --> 00:36:41,036
We are going to do something big
next month.

379
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:45,563
We are running a string of mules
from Colombia.

380
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:49,403
You do good on that,
there'll be some other things.

381
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:53,596
That sounds like fun to me, Frank.

382
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,200
You want a cigar?

383
00:37:00,127 --> 00:37:04,120
So, you want to dance, Frank, or you
want to sit here and have a heart attack?

384
00:37:08,607 --> 00:37:12,919
Who? Me, dance? I think
I want to have a heart attack instead.

385
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:17,004
Don't foam into the Dommie P.

386
00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:24,236
How about you?

387
00:37:28,527 --> 00:37:32,440
- What? You want me to dance?
- Yeah, sure, go on, Tony. You dance.

388
00:37:32,727 --> 00:37:35,525
Go on. Have some fun.

389
00:37:47,847 --> 00:37:49,599
What do you think of him?

390
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:51,878
I think he's a fucking peasant!

391
00:37:56,127 --> 00:37:58,641
But you get a guy like that on your side...

392
00:37:59,127 --> 00:38:01,322
...he breaks his back for you.

393
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:31,277
- What's your name?
- What?

394
00:38:32,447 --> 00:38:34,915
What's your name? Elvira what?

395
00:38:35,087 --> 00:38:37,282
- Hancock.
- What?

396
00:38:37,527 --> 00:38:39,836
- Hancock!
- Hancock?

397
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:44,325
Sounds like a bird. Hancock.

398
00:38:44,647 --> 00:38:46,080
Flying around.

399
00:38:48,207 --> 00:38:49,401
Where you from?

400
00:38:50,207 --> 00:38:52,243
- Baltimore.
- What?

401
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:54,159
- Baltimore!
- Baltimore?

402
00:38:54,647 --> 00:38:58,242
- Where's that?
- It doesn't really matter, all right?

403
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:01,835
I'm just trying to be friendly.

404
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:06,165
I don't need another friend, especially one
who just got off a banana boat.

405
00:39:07,927 --> 00:39:09,599
Banana boat?

406
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:13,282
Hold it. You got the wrong guy.
I don't come off no banana boat.

407
00:39:14,927 --> 00:39:17,202
You're thinking of someone else maybe.

408
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:19,643
Aren't you part of the Cuban crime wave?

409
00:39:19,727 --> 00:39:23,879
What you talking crazy for?
I'm a political refugee here.

410
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:26,880
- So take it easy. Don't talk crazy.
- Sorry.

411
00:39:27,207 --> 00:39:30,324
I didn't know you were so sensitive
about your diplomatic status.

412
00:39:30,407 --> 00:39:33,046
What is your problem, baby?

413
00:39:33,207 --> 00:39:36,438
You're good-looking.
You got a beautiful body, beautiful legs...

414
00:39:36,527 --> 00:39:39,166
...a beautiful face,
all these guys in love with you.

415
00:39:39,247 --> 00:39:43,081
Only you got a look in your eye
like you haven't been fucked in a year!

416
00:39:45,647 --> 00:39:48,798
Who, why, when and how I fuck
is none of your business, okay?

417
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:52,004
Now you're talking to me, baby.
That I like. Keep it coming.

418
00:39:52,087 --> 00:39:55,079
Don't call me "baby"! I'm not your baby.

419
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:58,201
Not yet,
but you gotta give me some time.

420
00:40:00,527 --> 00:40:02,643
Even if I were blind...

421
00:40:02,727 --> 00:40:05,924
...desperate, starved and begging for it
on a desert island...

422
00:40:06,007 --> 00:40:08,043
...you'd be the last thing I'd ever fuck.

423
00:40:11,647 --> 00:40:13,365
That chick he's with.

424
00:40:14,007 --> 00:40:15,520
- Yeah?
- She likes me.

425
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:20,444
She likes you? How do you know?

426
00:40:20,727 --> 00:40:21,876
I know.

427
00:40:23,247 --> 00:40:26,284
The eyes, chico. They never lie.

428
00:40:29,607 --> 00:40:33,361
- Are you serious?
- Serious? What do you think?

429
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:35,842
That's the boss's lady, okay?

430
00:40:35,927 --> 00:40:40,045
- You're gonna get us killed.
- Fuck you, man. The boss's lady.

431
00:40:41,087 --> 00:40:42,679
That guy's soft.

432
00:40:44,727 --> 00:40:46,126
Look in his face.

433
00:40:48,967 --> 00:40:51,561
The booze and the concha
tell him what to do.

434
00:40:54,087 --> 00:40:56,317
Don't fucking go crazy on me, okay?

435
00:40:57,207 --> 00:41:00,916
Just remember last year at this time
we were in a fucking cage, okay?

436
00:41:01,007 --> 00:41:02,326
You remember.

437
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,999
I'd like to forget that.

438
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:09,123
- I say be happy with what you got.
- You be happy.

439
00:41:10,847 --> 00:41:13,839
- Me, I want what's coming to me.
- What's coming to you?

440
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,284
The world, chico...

441
00:41:19,687 --> 00:41:21,518
...and everything in it.

442
00:41:55,687 --> 00:41:57,166
This is paradise.

443
00:41:58,607 --> 00:42:00,802
This is paradise, I'm telling you.

444
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:05,365
This town's like a great big pussy
just waiting to get fucked.

445
00:42:06,767 --> 00:42:09,156
I should've come here 10 years ago.

446
00:42:09,247 --> 00:42:11,807
I'd have been a millionaire by this time.

447
00:42:13,007 --> 00:42:16,522
By this time, I'd have had my own boat,
my own car...

448
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:18,160
...my own golf course.

449
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:21,080
You know what I want?
I thought of this the other day.

450
00:42:21,167 --> 00:42:25,877
A line of blue jeans. With my name
written on the back of chicks' asses.

451
00:42:27,407 --> 00:42:28,522
How's that?

452
00:42:29,207 --> 00:42:31,516
That sounds completely crazy to me.

453
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,520
Look at that. Look.

454
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:39,279
You're missing the sights. That's what
you're doing. We're missing the action.

455
00:42:41,447 --> 00:42:43,881
Want to have some ice cream
with my friend and me?

456
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:45,685
Get lost, greaseball!

457
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:48,439
- Look at that.
- "Ice cream"?

458
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:50,199
- That's right.
- You said "ice cream"?

459
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:53,359
- Girls like ice cream.
- Come on, man. That's not gonna work.

460
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:55,324
You can't do it that way.

461
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:58,205
You know how you pick up chicks
in this country?

462
00:43:02,007 --> 00:43:05,238
- What was that? What you just did?
- That's what you do.

463
00:43:06,047 --> 00:43:07,196
That's disgusting.

464
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:10,677
- Watch.
- Look at that. You look like a lizard.

465
00:43:10,927 --> 00:43:13,077
Like a bug coming out of your mouth.

466
00:43:14,087 --> 00:43:16,043
That figures you wouldn't understand.

467
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:19,199
But the women in this country,
when you do that, they know.

468
00:43:19,287 --> 00:43:22,120
- They know what?
- They understand. They go crazy.

469
00:43:23,087 --> 00:43:27,478
It'll take practice, but you gotta learn.
Women love when you suck the pussy.

470
00:43:27,607 --> 00:43:28,801
Look at that.

471
00:43:34,327 --> 00:43:35,840
She's looking at us.

472
00:43:38,607 --> 00:43:41,963
- You think you can do it with her?
- I think I can.

473
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:44,726
- You want to try it with her?
- Why not?

474
00:43:45,847 --> 00:43:49,078
- You gonna watch me?
- I'm looking at you. Go ahead.

475
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:50,725
- You won't do it.
- Watch this.

476
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,486
I'm with you, man.

477
00:43:54,207 --> 00:43:55,560
I'm gonna get her.

478
00:43:58,407 --> 00:44:00,557
Go ahead, Romeo! Do your thing.

479
00:44:01,087 --> 00:44:03,396
- Just be quiet. Just hang back.
- Romeo!

480
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:12,601
You're looking very pretty today.
Yes, you. I've been watching you.

481
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:16,886
You want to see something funny?
Take a look over there. See that man?

482
00:44:17,047 --> 00:44:19,322
Watch that guy. I gotta sit down here.

483
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:23,276
I gotta watch my friend
He gonna stick his tongue out to that girl.

484
00:44:23,407 --> 00:44:24,726
Look at that.

485
00:44:25,807 --> 00:44:26,762
You're sick!

486
00:44:26,847 --> 00:44:28,963
You see what happened to him?

487
00:44:29,647 --> 00:44:33,117
- Lf I wasn't a nice guy, I'd crack you.
- She's too big for you.

488
00:44:33,247 --> 00:44:35,477
- Causing trouble like that. Come on.
- Bitch!

489
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:37,319
- What I try to tell you?
- Lesbian!

490
00:44:37,407 --> 00:44:41,446
What I try to tell you? This country,
you gotta make the money first.

491
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:45,680
Then when you get the money,
you get the power.

492
00:44:45,807 --> 00:44:48,879
Then when you get the power,
then you get the women.

493
00:44:49,407 --> 00:44:51,363
That's why you gotta
make your own moves.

494
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:53,245
That's the one I rented.

495
00:44:53,847 --> 00:44:57,317
No. That's her, man. There she is.

496
00:44:57,847 --> 00:44:58,916
About time.

497
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:03,516
Frank got held up at the golf course.
He told me to pick you up.

498
00:45:04,447 --> 00:45:06,915
He said he'd meet us at the track later.

499
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,958
He said to bet on Ice Cream
in the first, by the way.

500
00:45:14,927 --> 00:45:17,600
In that thing? You must be kidding.

501
00:45:19,247 --> 00:45:22,239
What you talking about? That's a Cadillac.

502
00:45:23,927 --> 00:45:26,919
- I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
- Come on.

503
00:45:27,647 --> 00:45:32,163
You know, I mean, it's got a few years,
but it's a cream puff.

504
00:45:33,087 --> 00:45:35,203
It looks like somebody's nightmare.

505
00:45:44,407 --> 00:45:46,557
So, you like this better?

506
00:45:49,087 --> 00:45:53,638
It's like one of them tigers from India.

507
00:45:53,807 --> 00:45:55,684
Crazy guy. Know what he's been doing?

508
00:45:55,767 --> 00:45:58,486
Dragging me to the zoo to look at tigers.

509
00:45:58,687 --> 00:46:02,760
He says he's gonna buy one. You do that,
and you won't have any friends left.

510
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:05,919
- Not that you have any now.
- You're gonna like that tiger, man.

511
00:46:06,007 --> 00:46:08,805
You gonna drive around with a tiger
in your passenger seat?

512
00:46:08,887 --> 00:46:11,242
Maybe. Some lady tiger.

513
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:17,166
- How much?
- $43,000, fully equipped.

514
00:46:17,247 --> 00:46:20,557
- That all?
- Machine-gun turrets are extra.

515
00:46:20,687 --> 00:46:23,565
He's a funny guy. Come here, Manny.

516
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:30,527
Bulletproof this, okay?
And this here and here.

517
00:46:31,007 --> 00:46:32,201
And the windows.

518
00:46:34,647 --> 00:46:39,038
- Get me a phone with a scrambler.
- And a scrambler.

519
00:46:39,127 --> 00:46:43,006
And a radio with scanners,
to pick up flying saucers, stuff like that.

520
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,159
Don't forget the fog lights.

521
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:49,001
In case I get caught in the swamp.
That's a good idea.

522
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:54,845
Get out of the way, lady!
I'm trying to drive here!

523
00:46:56,207 --> 00:46:58,482
I thought you were taking me to Frank.

524
00:47:03,847 --> 00:47:06,236
We got an hour. You hungry?

525
00:47:07,927 --> 00:47:09,599
No, but I'm bored.

526
00:47:10,647 --> 00:47:12,205
Well, that figures.

527
00:47:14,287 --> 00:47:17,438
Check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.

528
00:47:17,727 --> 00:47:20,799
And, you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track, okay?

529
00:47:20,967 --> 00:47:22,400
Good doing business with you.

530
00:47:27,807 --> 00:47:30,116
I wouldn't buy the car if you didn't like it.

531
00:47:30,207 --> 00:47:32,880
Planning on driving the girls crazy,
aren't you, Tony?

532
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:35,117
Yeah. You know who?

533
00:47:37,127 --> 00:47:38,845
And what would Frank say?

534
00:47:41,127 --> 00:47:42,765
I like Frank, you know?

535
00:47:43,287 --> 00:47:45,039
Only I like you better.

536
00:47:52,567 --> 00:47:54,797
- You got some for me?
- Sure.

537
00:48:12,327 --> 00:48:16,923
Don't get confused, Tony.
I don't fuck around with the help.

538
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:27,842
You wanna play that way with me,
I play with you.

539
00:48:27,967 --> 00:48:29,116
Shit.

540
00:48:29,727 --> 00:48:32,525
- Would you kiss me if I wear the hat?
- No!

541
00:48:34,687 --> 00:48:36,803
Playtime is over, okay?

542
00:49:31,687 --> 00:49:32,915
Mama?

543
00:49:36,127 --> 00:49:37,355
Long time.

544
00:49:40,047 --> 00:49:41,719
No postcards from jail?

545
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,242
Gina.

546
00:49:54,927 --> 00:49:57,680
- Tony?
- Look at you.

547
00:49:59,487 --> 00:50:00,966
You're beautiful.

548
00:50:01,647 --> 00:50:04,286
- I didn't...
- Mama, look at those eyes.

549
00:50:04,527 --> 00:50:07,246
Look at that. She looks like me.

550
00:50:07,367 --> 00:50:10,120
You know the last time I saw you,
you was like that.

551
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,563
You looked like a little boy.
But now look at you.

552
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:19,564
I got something for you.

553
00:50:24,487 --> 00:50:26,239
It's no big deal.

554
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,482
I never thought I'd see you again,
you know?

555
00:50:42,567 --> 00:50:44,603
You think they'd keep
a guy like me down?

556
00:50:44,687 --> 00:50:46,166
Well, no.

557
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:55,002
- You look so good.
- Look, open that up. Open it.

558
00:50:55,647 --> 00:50:57,842
- For me?
- I think so.

559
00:50:59,007 --> 00:51:02,238
It's nothing much, you know, nothing.

560
00:51:07,007 --> 00:51:09,885
- Do you see what's written on the back?
- On the back?

561
00:51:11,647 --> 00:51:15,401
- "Always."
- "Always." It's beautiful, Tony!

562
00:51:16,887 --> 00:51:21,039
Mama is still working in the factory
and I work part-time in a beauty parlor.

563
00:51:21,127 --> 00:51:24,085
I'm doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember Hiram Gonzalez?

564
00:51:24,327 --> 00:51:26,966
His father owned that barbershop.
It's his place.

565
00:51:27,047 --> 00:51:29,561
Plus I go to junior college. Miami Dade.

566
00:51:29,727 --> 00:51:32,639
And in two more years,
I get my cosmetology license.

567
00:51:32,727 --> 00:51:39,360
- And then I'll be making enough money...
- Surprise! All that's over, starting today.

568
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,477
Why?

569
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:45,038
My kid sister don't have to work
in no beauty parlor and Mama...

570
00:51:45,647 --> 00:51:47,956
...she don't have to sew in no factory.

571
00:51:48,247 --> 00:51:50,283
Your son made it, Mama.

572
00:51:51,647 --> 00:51:52,921
He's a success.

573
00:51:54,047 --> 00:51:56,356
That's why I didn't come around before.

574
00:51:57,247 --> 00:52:01,001
I want you to see
what a good boy I've been.

575
00:52:03,327 --> 00:52:04,726
Here's $ 1,000.

576
00:52:05,527 --> 00:52:06,880
For you, Mama.

577
00:52:14,407 --> 00:52:16,523
Who did you kill for this, Antonio?

578
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,198
I didn't kill nobody, Mama.

579
00:52:20,127 --> 00:52:21,196
- No?
- No.

580
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:24,044
What are you doing now?

581
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:27,565
Banks, or is it still bodegas,
you and the others?

582
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:32,596
No! Things are different now.
I'm working with an anti-Castro group.

583
00:52:32,967 --> 00:52:36,801
I'm an organizer now,
and I get a lot of political contributions.

584
00:52:37,807 --> 00:52:39,240
Sure you do.

585
00:52:43,487 --> 00:52:46,445
A gun sticking in somebody's face is how.

586
00:52:48,007 --> 00:52:50,885
You know, all we hear about
in the papers...

587
00:52:52,647 --> 00:52:55,480
...is animals like you and the killings.

588
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:59,318
It's Cubans like you who are giving
a bad name to our people.

589
00:52:59,407 --> 00:53:02,604
People who come here, work hard
and make a good name for themselves.

590
00:53:02,687 --> 00:53:04,564
People who send their children to school.

591
00:53:04,647 --> 00:53:07,241
- What are you saying? That's your son!
- Son?

592
00:53:08,087 --> 00:53:11,045
I wish I had one. He's a bum.

593
00:53:11,207 --> 00:53:13,926
He was a bum then and he's a bum now.

594
00:53:15,847 --> 00:53:17,565
Who do you think you are?

595
00:53:20,007 --> 00:53:22,840
We haven't heard a word
from you in five years.

596
00:53:25,807 --> 00:53:28,401
You suddenly show up here,
throw some money around...

597
00:53:28,487 --> 00:53:30,842
...and think you can get my respect.

598
00:53:31,407 --> 00:53:33,841
- You think you can buy me with jewelry?
- Come on.

599
00:53:33,927 --> 00:53:37,522
You think you can come into my house
with your hotshot clothes...

600
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:40,036
...and your jail manners
and make fun of us?

601
00:53:40,127 --> 00:53:44,086
- You don't know what you're saying.
- That's not the way I am!

602
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:46,676
That is not the way I raised Gina to be!

603
00:53:48,727 --> 00:53:51,082
You are not going to destroy her.

604
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,359
I don't need your money.

605
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:58,119
I work for my living.

606
00:53:58,647 --> 00:54:01,115
I don't want you in this house anymore!

607
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:03,444
I don't want you around Gina.

608
00:54:04,327 --> 00:54:06,921
So, come on. Get out!

609
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:21,881
And take this lousy money with you.
It stinks.

610
00:54:24,727 --> 00:54:27,480
Why do you have to spoil it
for everybody?

611
00:54:30,007 --> 00:54:31,599
I'm sorry, Tony.

612
00:54:33,287 --> 00:54:34,606
Okay, Mama.

613
00:54:38,727 --> 00:54:40,160
No. Tony, wait a minute!

614
00:54:40,247 --> 00:54:42,317
- Don't go, please!
- Gina, stay here!

615
00:54:42,567 --> 00:54:44,603
- No, Mama.
- He's no good. Gina!

616
00:54:45,847 --> 00:54:47,599
Tony, wait, please!

617
00:54:48,207 --> 00:54:52,485
I'm sorry. I don't know.
Mama, ever since Papa left she's...

618
00:54:52,567 --> 00:54:54,637
Forget Papa. We never had one.

619
00:54:54,847 --> 00:54:57,281
I know you did
some bad things back then.

620
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:00,121
In the Army,
I know you got into some trouble.

621
00:55:00,207 --> 00:55:03,517
The Communists, they're always trying
to tell you what to do.

622
00:55:04,047 --> 00:55:06,845
- Mama doesn't understand that.
- I know.

623
00:55:08,327 --> 00:55:13,082
I just, I don't know.
I just want you to know that I don't care.

624
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:17,356
It doesn't matter to me how long
you've been away, five or ten years.

625
00:55:19,367 --> 00:55:22,439
You're my blood, always.

626
00:55:23,607 --> 00:55:24,676
I know.

627
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:37,839
- Come on. I want you to take this.
- I gotta go back in.

628
00:55:37,927 --> 00:55:40,521
- No, Tony. Please.
- You need this.

629
00:55:40,607 --> 00:55:43,644
- What will I tell her?
- Take that. You don't tell her anything.

630
00:55:43,727 --> 00:55:47,117
Don't tell her I gave it to you,
but give her some from time to time.

631
00:55:47,207 --> 00:55:49,721
And listen, you go out yourself.

632
00:55:49,807 --> 00:55:53,083
Go ahead, go out, do some things.
Have some fun.

633
00:55:53,247 --> 00:55:55,317
You gotta get some fun out of life.

634
00:55:55,407 --> 00:56:00,606
You gonna beat yourself to death at 19?
Pussycat like you? Come here.

635
00:56:04,847 --> 00:56:06,644
- I'll talk to you again.
- Okay.

636
00:56:06,727 --> 00:56:10,163
- Put the money away so she won't see it.
- I'll talk to her.

637
00:56:12,127 --> 00:56:13,480
I'll talk to you.

638
00:56:15,527 --> 00:56:16,562
Let's go.

639
00:56:18,487 --> 00:56:20,717
She's beautiful. How come you...

640
00:56:23,367 --> 00:56:26,916
Stay away from her, man. You hear?

641
00:56:28,007 --> 00:56:29,281
She's not for you.

642
00:56:55,007 --> 00:56:57,965
So, this and my other factory,
I can guarantee production...

643
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:01,960
...of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year.

644
00:57:02,407 --> 00:57:04,557
The problem is, I have no steady market.

645
00:57:04,647 --> 00:57:07,923
Basically, what I'm looking for
is somebody in the States...

646
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:11,238
...who can share the risk with me,
somebody who can guarantee...

647
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:15,366
...to buy from me, say, 150 kilos a month.

648
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,884
That's a big commitment, Mr. Sosa.
Something like that...

649
00:57:20,927 --> 00:57:23,157
Too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.

650
00:57:23,247 --> 00:57:26,205
- It would've been nice if he'd come.
- He would like to come...

651
00:57:26,287 --> 00:57:30,439
...but with his trial coming up,
it's hard for him to get out of the country.

652
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:34,037
- So he sent you instead?
- Something like that.

653
00:57:34,127 --> 00:57:36,277
We'll talk at my house, shall we?

654
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:40,163
You got good stuff here. Class-A shit.

655
00:58:01,127 --> 00:58:05,598
So, this Lopez guarantees to buy from me
150 kilos every month of the year.

656
00:58:05,767 --> 00:58:09,157
He picks it up here.
I can sell it to him for as little as...

657
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:14,677
...$ 7,000 a key.
You can't do better than that.

658
00:58:15,487 --> 00:58:18,206
But then we got to take the risk
of moving it.

659
00:58:18,407 --> 00:58:21,240
We'll be cutting out the Colombians.
Know what that means?

660
00:58:21,327 --> 00:58:23,158
That means we have to go
to war with them.

661
00:58:23,247 --> 00:58:26,284
We cut out the Colombians,
we take risks on both sides.

662
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:28,564
Why don't we split the risk?

663
00:58:30,167 --> 00:58:33,557
You guarantee your delivery,
say, as far as Panama...

664
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,039
...we take it from there.

665
00:58:38,287 --> 00:58:41,563
Panama is risky. It costs me more.

666
00:58:43,167 --> 00:58:47,240
Panama I can sell for $ 13,500 a key.

667
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,881
$ 13,500? What, are you nuts?

668
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:55,877
$ 13,500? We still got to take
that shit to Florida.

669
00:58:55,967 --> 00:59:00,085
Do you know what that's like these days?
You got the fucking Navy everywhere.

670
00:59:00,247 --> 00:59:04,399
You got frogmen. You got EC-2s
with the satellite-tracking shit.

671
00:59:05,007 --> 00:59:08,124
You got the fucking
Bell 209 Assault Choppers up the ass.

672
00:59:08,607 --> 00:59:10,996
We're losing one out of every nine loads.

673
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:14,725
That's no duckwalk anymore,
let me tell you.

674
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:16,326
Forget about $ 13,500.

675
00:59:19,727 --> 00:59:22,366
What do you suggest that is reasonable?

676
00:59:27,727 --> 00:59:29,683
Excuse me. One moment.

677
00:59:33,967 --> 00:59:36,197
What the fuck's the matter with you?

678
00:59:36,287 --> 00:59:40,121
- You negotiating for Frank Lopez?
- Don't worry about it. Take it easy.

679
00:59:40,207 --> 00:59:43,119
I'm not worried about it.
You should worry about it.

680
00:59:43,687 --> 00:59:46,485
If he wants to make a deal,
it's up to him, not you.

681
00:59:46,567 --> 00:59:49,923
- We're gonna do this one deal. That's it.
- Fuck you. How's that?

682
00:59:51,047 --> 00:59:52,685
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

683
00:59:52,807 --> 00:59:55,446
You need to open your eyes
and keep your mouth shut.

684
00:59:55,527 --> 00:59:58,325
- That's it. Let it go at that.
- Don't worry about it.

685
00:59:58,407 --> 01:00:01,558
Your head's in the wrong place.
You must watch out for yourself.

686
01:00:01,647 --> 01:00:04,639
Why not talk to him? You think
he wants to give you the money?

687
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:08,197
- Shut the fuck up.
- I'm doing the talking here, not you.

688
01:00:09,127 --> 01:00:11,641
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.

689
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:16,357
Better than your front, let me tell you.
That's easier to watch.

690
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:17,800
Close your mouth.

691
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:21,364
I can't wait to see what Frank's
gonna react to this one.

692
01:00:21,927 --> 01:00:24,395
Just shut up. I'm doing the talking here.

693
01:00:25,607 --> 01:00:27,962
- Now where were we?
- Panama.

694
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:30,557
You're looking for a partner, right?

695
01:00:31,887 --> 01:00:33,366
Something like that.

696
01:00:33,447 --> 01:00:36,803
Look, Mr. Sosa,
we're getting ahead of ourselves here.

697
01:00:37,447 --> 01:00:41,486
I am down on Frank's authority
to buy 200 keys, that's it.

698
01:00:41,727 --> 01:00:43,922
That's my limit. I got no right.

699
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:46,965
- Nobody got no right to negotiate...
- Let the man finish, okay?

700
01:00:47,047 --> 01:00:49,641
Let him propose a proposition,
then we can talk more.

701
01:00:49,727 --> 01:00:51,638
You got no authority here.

702
01:00:51,727 --> 01:00:54,195
I started you in this business,
so shut the fuck up.

703
01:00:54,287 --> 01:00:58,360
- Frank is gonna love it.
- That's up to Frank, not you!

704
01:01:01,767 --> 01:01:03,723
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa.

705
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:05,646
No, it is all right.

706
01:01:06,167 --> 01:01:09,284
You're right.
Maybe you should talk to Frank.

707
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:13,116
Well, good.

708
01:01:14,407 --> 01:01:17,604
I don't think it's something
I want to do on an overseas phone.

709
01:01:17,687 --> 01:01:22,397
But as soon as I get back to Miami,
I will talk to Frank personally.

710
01:01:23,487 --> 01:01:24,476
Good.

711
01:01:25,207 --> 01:01:29,246
My associates here can escort you
to my chopper, to take you to Santa Cruz.

712
01:01:29,327 --> 01:01:32,285
I have a jet there.
I can have you in Miami in five hours.

713
01:01:32,367 --> 01:01:35,245
You'll be back here tomorrow
in time for lunch.

714
01:01:36,767 --> 01:01:37,643
Good.

715
01:01:41,487 --> 01:01:43,045
Good talking to you.

716
01:01:44,047 --> 01:01:46,083
Why don't you leave your friend here?

717
01:01:46,167 --> 01:01:48,840
While you're gone, he can tell me
how to run my business.

718
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:51,885
- I think Frank would like to see him.
- No, that's okay.

719
01:01:51,967 --> 01:01:55,482
You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy
on ice for him.

720
01:01:58,127 --> 01:01:59,606
I guess so.

721
01:02:02,727 --> 01:02:04,479
Let's finish our lunch.

722
01:02:08,807 --> 01:02:10,923
I have to hand it to you, Mr. Sosa.

723
01:02:12,247 --> 01:02:14,397
You got everything a man could want.

724
01:02:16,287 --> 01:02:18,960
I like you, Tony. There is no lying in you.

725
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:24,480
Unfortunately, I do not feel the same
about the rest of your organization.

726
01:02:27,887 --> 01:02:30,037
What do you mean by that, Mr. Sosa?

727
01:02:30,687 --> 01:02:32,996
I'm talking about Omar Suarez.

728
01:02:35,607 --> 01:02:38,963
This garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch...

729
01:02:39,887 --> 01:02:42,162
...from several years ago in New York.

730
01:02:46,287 --> 01:02:48,323
He was an informer for the police.

731
01:03:05,447 --> 01:03:09,326
He put Vito Duval and the Ramos
brothers, Nello and Gino, away for life.

732
01:03:13,967 --> 01:03:16,686
So how do I know
you're not a chivato, too, Tony?

733
01:03:23,447 --> 01:03:25,597
Let's get this straight now.

734
01:03:27,247 --> 01:03:32,685
I never fucked anybody over in my life
who didn't have it coming. You got that?

735
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:37,879
All I have in this world is my balls
and my word and I don't break them...

736
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:40,715
...for no one, you understand?

737
01:03:41,807 --> 01:03:45,561
That piece of shit up there,
I never like him, I never trusted him.

738
01:03:46,047 --> 01:03:50,120
For all I know, he had me set up and
had my friend, Angel Fernandez, killed.

739
01:03:50,407 --> 01:03:52,716
But that's history. I'm here, he's not.

740
01:03:52,807 --> 01:03:57,597
You want to go on with me, say it.
You don't, then you make a move.

741
01:04:03,247 --> 01:04:06,956
I think you speak from the heart,
Montana. But I say to myself...

742
01:04:08,287 --> 01:04:10,198
...this Lopez, your boss...

743
01:04:11,207 --> 01:04:16,076
...he had chivatos like that
working for him. His judgment stinks.

744
01:04:18,807 --> 01:04:20,718
So I think to myself...

745
01:04:21,127 --> 01:04:24,005
...how many other mistakes
has this Lopez guy made?

746
01:04:26,327 --> 01:04:30,115
How can I trust his organization?
You tell me, Tony.

747
01:04:32,367 --> 01:04:35,120
Frank is smart, you know?

748
01:04:37,487 --> 01:04:39,637
You can't blame him for that animal.

749
01:04:40,807 --> 01:04:43,560
It's a crazy business we're in,
you know?

750
01:04:43,647 --> 01:04:46,207
That could happen to anyone, even you.

751
01:04:52,407 --> 01:04:55,160
Why don't I go back and talk to Frank...

752
01:04:56,087 --> 01:04:57,520
...and work it out?

753
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,244
I'll fix things between us.

754
01:05:02,087 --> 01:05:03,645
You got my word on that.

755
01:05:05,207 --> 01:05:07,960
I think you and me,
we can work this thing out...

756
01:05:08,567 --> 01:05:10,876
...and do business together a long time.

757
01:05:12,807 --> 01:05:14,081
Just remember...

758
01:05:15,047 --> 01:05:17,117
...I'll only tell you one time...

759
01:05:18,327 --> 01:05:20,158
...don't fuck me, Tony.

760
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:24,598
Don't you ever try to fuck me.

761
01:05:37,887 --> 01:05:39,115
You what?

762
01:05:41,247 --> 01:05:43,886
You made a deal
for a fucking $ 18 million...

763
01:05:43,967 --> 01:05:45,878
...without even checking with me?

764
01:05:45,967 --> 01:05:48,037
Are you crazy, Montana? Are you crazy?

765
01:05:48,127 --> 01:05:49,845
- Coño. Take it easy.
- Coño, my ass!

766
01:05:49,927 --> 01:05:52,919
At $ 10,500 a key, it's puro.

767
01:05:54,407 --> 01:05:56,637
You can't lose money. No way.

768
01:05:58,567 --> 01:06:01,923
We make $ 75 million on this deal, Frank.

769
01:06:02,767 --> 01:06:04,837
$ 75 million.

770
01:06:06,007 --> 01:06:07,759
That is serious money.

771
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:12,040
What is Sosa going to do when I don't
come up with the first $5 million?

772
01:06:12,127 --> 01:06:14,846
What is he going to do?
Will he send me a bill?

773
01:06:14,927 --> 01:06:18,237
He'll send a hit squad up here!
There'll be a war in the street.

774
01:06:18,327 --> 01:06:21,922
Relax! Take it easy.
I'm in tight with Sosa.

775
01:06:23,687 --> 01:06:26,679
You short a couple of million,
I go on the street for you.

776
01:06:26,847 --> 01:06:28,644
I make a couple of moves...

777
01:06:29,327 --> 01:06:31,602
...a million here, a million there,
you got it.

778
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:39,357
You've been making moves on your own?

779
01:06:41,487 --> 01:06:44,365
I got ears, you know? I hear things.

780
01:06:47,967 --> 01:06:50,845
What do you hear about Echevarria
and the Diaz brothers?

781
01:06:50,927 --> 01:06:55,239
What about Gomez? What is he gonna
do when you start moving 2,000 keys...

782
01:06:55,327 --> 01:07:00,162
Fuck Gaspar Gomez and fuck
the fucking Diaz brothers! Fuck 'em all!

783
01:07:01,207 --> 01:07:03,437
I'll bury those cockroaches!

784
01:07:04,927 --> 01:07:06,645
What they ever do for us?

785
01:07:14,127 --> 01:07:17,005
Look, Frank, the time has come.

786
01:07:18,447 --> 01:07:20,039
We gotta expand.

787
01:07:20,807 --> 01:07:23,560
The whole operation. Distribution.

788
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:27,719
New York, Chicago, LA.

789
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:32,080
We gotta set our own mark
and enforce it.

790
01:07:32,927 --> 01:07:34,519
We gotta think big now.

791
01:07:39,007 --> 01:07:40,042
"Think big."

792
01:07:45,967 --> 01:07:47,605
Like your friend Sosa.

793
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:53,118
Let me tell you something
about that greaseball cocksucker.

794
01:07:53,647 --> 01:07:56,115
He is a snake, that's what he is.

795
01:07:57,887 --> 01:08:01,675
You turn your back on him,
he'll stick it in.

796
01:08:02,487 --> 01:08:04,478
You don't trust a guy like that.

797
01:08:05,927 --> 01:08:08,077
You want me to believe...

798
01:08:08,767 --> 01:08:12,680
...Omar was a stoolie
because Sosa said so?

799
01:08:13,167 --> 01:08:14,646
You bought that line?

800
01:08:15,887 --> 01:08:18,606
Maybe I made a mistake
sending you down there.

801
01:08:20,007 --> 01:08:22,885
Maybe you and Sosa
know something I don't know.

802
01:08:26,087 --> 01:08:27,202
Like what?

803
01:08:28,367 --> 01:08:29,720
"Like what?"

804
01:08:31,287 --> 01:08:33,323
You tell me, "Like what."

805
01:08:37,367 --> 01:08:39,801
You calling me a liar, Frank?

806
01:08:40,807 --> 01:08:42,479
That what you calling me?

807
01:08:48,247 --> 01:08:51,842
Let's just say I want things
to stay the way they are for now.

808
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:57,515
You stall your deal with Sosa.

809
01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:00,395
Stall it?

810
01:09:04,687 --> 01:09:06,086
Okay, Boss.

811
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:07,716
Come on.

812
01:09:10,127 --> 01:09:11,276
I am the boss.

813
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:14,916
- Sure, you're the boss.
- Hey, Tony.

814
01:09:19,127 --> 01:09:21,595
Remember I told you when you started...

815
01:09:21,767 --> 01:09:24,156
...the guys who last in this business...

816
01:09:25,007 --> 01:09:27,123
...are the guys who fly straight...

817
01:09:28,367 --> 01:09:29,800
...low-key, quiet.

818
01:09:31,047 --> 01:09:33,003
And the guys who want it all...

819
01:09:33,687 --> 01:09:36,838
...chicas, champagne, flash...

820
01:09:38,727 --> 01:09:40,126
...they don't last.

821
01:09:41,567 --> 01:09:42,795
You finished?

822
01:09:43,687 --> 01:09:44,836
Can I go now?

823
01:10:06,247 --> 01:10:08,317
Hi, there.

824
01:10:14,927 --> 01:10:16,485
You just missed Frank.

825
01:10:19,527 --> 01:10:20,596
Too bad.

826
01:10:22,887 --> 01:10:24,878
Only I didn't come to see Frank.

827
01:10:26,367 --> 01:10:29,165
This is not the time or the place, Tony.

828
01:10:29,647 --> 01:10:32,115
- Next time, make an appointment first.
- That's okay.

829
01:10:32,207 --> 01:10:35,199
I got something important
I want to talk to you about.

830
01:10:41,807 --> 01:10:44,275
So why don't we have
a couple of drinks...

831
01:10:44,727 --> 01:10:46,080
...act normal...

832
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:49,999
...and just take it easy.

833
01:10:50,807 --> 01:10:52,638
Come on. I like scotch.

834
01:10:57,327 --> 01:11:00,478
- Sure. Why not?
- Okay. I won't bite you.

835
01:11:03,007 --> 01:11:04,918
We're all normal here.

836
01:11:08,527 --> 01:11:12,076
I heard you and Frank
aren't working together anymore.

837
01:11:12,447 --> 01:11:13,721
That's right.

838
01:11:18,127 --> 01:11:20,277
I think it's easier, don't you?

839
01:11:21,007 --> 01:11:22,645
Makes things easier.

840
01:11:25,087 --> 01:11:26,156
Thank you.

841
01:11:27,447 --> 01:11:29,483
Here's to "the land of opportunity."

842
01:11:30,487 --> 01:11:31,886
For you, maybe.

843
01:11:36,767 --> 01:11:37,916
You like kids?

844
01:11:39,727 --> 01:11:40,716
Kids?

845
01:11:41,327 --> 01:11:43,477
Kids. You know, kids. Little kids.

846
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:47,203
Sure. Why not?

847
01:11:47,567 --> 01:11:49,000
As long as there's a nurse.

848
01:11:49,087 --> 01:11:51,920
Good, 'cause I like kids, too.

849
01:11:53,807 --> 01:11:57,766
I like them. Boys, girls.
Don't matter to me.

850
01:12:00,927 --> 01:12:02,963
Frank's gonna be back any minute.

851
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:04,886
Come here.

852
01:12:11,647 --> 01:12:12,636
Sit here.

853
01:12:13,487 --> 01:12:16,638
I want to talk to you. Sit down.
I'm not gonna bite you.

854
01:12:22,367 --> 01:12:24,085
Okay, here's the story.

855
01:12:27,247 --> 01:12:30,284
I come from the gutter. I know that.

856
01:12:32,567 --> 01:12:34,159
I got no education...

857
01:12:35,007 --> 01:12:36,486
...but that's okay.

858
01:12:37,767 --> 01:12:41,442
I know the street, and
I'm making all the right connections.

859
01:12:43,367 --> 01:12:46,757
With the right woman,
there's no stopping me.

860
01:12:47,527 --> 01:12:49,518
I could go right to the top.

861
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:52,602
Anyway...

862
01:12:53,447 --> 01:12:55,517
...what I got to tell you is this:

863
01:12:57,607 --> 01:12:59,086
I like you.

864
01:13:02,247 --> 01:13:04,920
I liked you
the first time I laid eyes on you.

865
01:13:08,007 --> 01:13:10,475
I said, "She's a tiger.

866
01:13:12,807 --> 01:13:14,684
"She belongs to me."

867
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:19,880
Anyway...

868
01:13:21,127 --> 01:13:22,845
...I want you to marry me.

869
01:13:25,807 --> 01:13:28,605
I want you to be
the mother of my children.

870
01:13:31,327 --> 01:13:34,239
Me? Marry you?

871
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:35,521
That's right.

872
01:13:40,047 --> 01:13:41,719
What about Frank, Tony?

873
01:13:42,407 --> 01:13:43,920
What will you do about Frank?

874
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:47,397
Frank is not gonna last, okay?
He's finished.

875
01:13:49,647 --> 01:13:52,115
Just think about it, okay?

876
01:13:53,367 --> 01:13:55,642
I want you to really think about it.

877
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:01,045
I'll go now. Take care.

878
01:14:09,207 --> 01:14:10,959
All your enemies are gone.

879
01:14:12,407 --> 01:14:14,875
- Mr. Montana. How are you?
- Hello.

880
01:14:22,327 --> 01:14:24,204
What the fuck she doing here?

881
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:28,479
Come on, man. She's just dancing.
Come on. Take it easy.

882
01:14:41,087 --> 01:14:44,557
- It's just a disco.
- Who's that guy she with?

883
01:14:45,727 --> 01:14:48,002
He's some guy who works for Lugo.
He's nobody.

884
01:14:48,087 --> 01:14:49,725
- He's harmless.
- Works for Lugo?

885
01:14:49,807 --> 01:14:52,162
Yeah. Forget him.

886
01:14:54,007 --> 01:14:57,761
Hello, Tony. Well, you remember me?

887
01:15:00,087 --> 01:15:03,796
Bernstein. Mel Bernstein, right?

888
01:15:04,647 --> 01:15:06,683
Chief Detective, Narcotics.

889
01:15:07,607 --> 01:15:10,121
That's right, yeah.
I think we should talk.

890
01:15:10,767 --> 01:15:13,281
Talk? What are we going to talk about?

891
01:15:13,807 --> 01:15:16,685
I ain't killed nobody, not lately.

892
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:18,316
No, not lately.

893
01:15:18,407 --> 01:15:22,116
What about ancient history,
like Emilio Rebenga?

894
01:15:22,567 --> 01:15:25,604
Or a bunch of whacked-out Indians
at the Sun Ray Motel?

895
01:15:27,127 --> 01:15:30,881
Whoever's giving you your information
is taking you for a long ride.

896
01:15:32,407 --> 01:15:34,682
Tony, baby, we gonna talk...

897
01:15:34,767 --> 01:15:38,316
...or am I gonna bust
your wise-ass spic balls, here and now?

898
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:46,120
Keep your eye on her.

899
01:15:47,127 --> 01:15:48,606
- I'll do that.
- Okay.

900
01:15:50,287 --> 01:15:52,198
- My office.
- Good.

901
01:15:59,647 --> 01:16:03,117
The word on the street is
you're bringing in a lot of yeyo.

902
01:16:03,367 --> 01:16:05,756
That means you're not
a small-time punk anymore...

903
01:16:05,847 --> 01:16:07,644
...you're public property now.

904
01:16:07,727 --> 01:16:10,446
Supreme court says
that your privacy can be invaded.

905
01:16:10,527 --> 01:16:12,199
Okay. How much?

906
01:16:13,687 --> 01:16:15,006
How much?

907
01:16:15,687 --> 01:16:18,042
Well, there's an answer to that, too.

908
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:25,686
Here's how much.

909
01:16:26,887 --> 01:16:28,115
Can you see it?

910
01:16:30,087 --> 01:16:31,884
- Big number.
- Yeah!

911
01:16:32,047 --> 01:16:34,845
That's on a monthly basis,
same thing every month.

912
01:16:35,287 --> 01:16:36,925
You know how this works?

913
01:16:38,767 --> 01:16:40,120
No. You tell me.

914
01:16:40,687 --> 01:16:42,996
We tell you who's moving against you...

915
01:16:43,367 --> 01:16:46,040
...and we shake down
who you want shaken down.

916
01:16:46,887 --> 01:16:50,084
Let's say that you got
a real problem making a collection.

917
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:53,238
And then we step in for you.

918
01:16:53,647 --> 01:16:55,877
Got eight killers with badges
working for me.

919
01:16:55,967 --> 01:16:58,925
When they hit, it hurts.
Same thing works the other way.

920
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,998
You feed me a bust now and then.

921
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:04,484
Some cowboy setting himself up
in business.

922
01:17:05,127 --> 01:17:07,277
Small-fry, you know?

923
01:17:10,927 --> 01:17:12,485
We like snacks.

924
01:17:12,727 --> 01:17:15,958
How do I know you're the last cop
I'm gonna have to grease?

925
01:17:16,647 --> 01:17:21,163
What about Fort Lauderdale?
Metro? DEA?

926
01:17:21,967 --> 01:17:24,765
How do I know what rock
they're gonna crawl out from under?

927
01:17:24,847 --> 01:17:28,886
Well, that's not my business, Tony.
We don't cross no lines.

928
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:32,556
Listen, you think I want
this conversation...

929
01:17:32,647 --> 01:17:34,603
...going any farther than this table?

930
01:17:35,047 --> 01:17:38,164
My guys got families.
They're legitimate cops.

931
01:17:38,447 --> 01:17:40,358
I don't want to see them embarrassed.

932
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:44,838
If they're embarrassed, they'll suffer.
If they suffer, they'll make you suffer.

933
01:17:47,407 --> 01:17:49,682
You understand what I'm talking about?

934
01:17:59,927 --> 01:18:01,519
Thanks for the drink.

935
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,686
By the way...

936
01:18:06,687 --> 01:18:08,598
...I got a vacation coming up.

937
01:18:08,807 --> 01:18:12,561
I'm gonna take the wife to London,
England. We've never been there.

938
01:18:12,767 --> 01:18:15,918
So, throw in a couple of
round-trip tickets, first class.

939
01:18:22,527 --> 01:18:25,644
You ought to smile more, Tony.
You gotta enjoy yourself.

940
01:18:26,247 --> 01:18:28,556
Every day above ground is a good day.

941
01:18:40,727 --> 01:18:42,683
- Hello.
- Hello.

942
01:18:44,087 --> 01:18:46,078
Yeah. Now that's the idea.

943
01:18:46,207 --> 01:18:47,879
Okay, Mel.

944
01:18:50,127 --> 01:18:51,958
You think about what I said?

945
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:53,721
About the kids?

946
01:18:55,087 --> 01:18:59,399
- You know, you are really nuts.
- I'm nuts about you.

947
01:19:00,207 --> 01:19:02,482
Tony, why don't you find your own girl?

948
01:19:02,727 --> 01:19:03,842
- My own girl?
- Yeah.

949
01:19:03,927 --> 01:19:06,839
- That's what I'm doing.
- Go do it somewhere else. Get lost.

950
01:19:06,927 --> 01:19:09,077
Maybe I don't hear so good sometimes.

951
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:11,403
You won't hear anything
if you go on like this.

952
01:19:11,487 --> 01:19:12,442
Will you do something?

953
01:19:12,527 --> 01:19:15,166
You're fucking right
I'm going to do something!

954
01:19:16,567 --> 01:19:18,444
I'm giving you orders. Blow!

955
01:19:18,567 --> 01:19:22,082
Orders? You giving me orders?

956
01:19:25,647 --> 01:19:29,481
The only thing in this world...

957
01:19:29,767 --> 01:19:33,237
...that gives orders is balls.
You got that?

958
01:19:34,727 --> 01:19:35,876
Balls.

959
01:19:45,887 --> 01:19:47,036
Let's go.

960
01:19:54,527 --> 01:19:55,596
Elvira.

961
01:19:56,967 --> 01:19:58,639
When you gonna learn?

962
01:20:01,287 --> 01:20:04,836
Looking good, honey.
Keep up the bad work.

963
01:20:06,527 --> 01:20:08,040
- That cocksucker.
- What happened?

964
01:20:09,407 --> 01:20:13,082
- He put that prick Bernstein on me.
- Who? Lopez did?

965
01:20:14,567 --> 01:20:18,037
- How do you know?
- Who else knew about Rebenga? Omar?

966
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,239
He's fertilizer.

967
01:20:20,727 --> 01:20:23,161
He's letting me know
he's got weight on me.

968
01:20:26,207 --> 01:20:27,799
I'll tell you what, man.

969
01:20:27,887 --> 01:20:30,720
You know our little trip
we're been planning to New York?

970
01:20:30,807 --> 01:20:32,479
It might be a good time.

971
01:20:48,887 --> 01:20:50,764
Wait. Where you going?

972
01:21:15,487 --> 01:21:17,159
Welcome to my private room.

973
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,841
- Your private room.
- This is my private room.

974
01:21:19,927 --> 01:21:23,442
I got a beautiful, nice,
white lounge chair for you.

975
01:21:28,367 --> 01:21:30,642
Gina, you taste so muy bueno.

976
01:21:35,847 --> 01:21:37,678
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

977
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:41,282
- What? We wasn't doing nothing!
- Fernando, wait!

978
01:21:41,607 --> 01:21:42,926
Get out!

979
01:21:45,607 --> 01:21:46,926
Damn you!

980
01:21:47,007 --> 01:21:48,679
You think he's cute?

981
01:21:48,767 --> 01:21:52,646
I saw him putting his hand all over
your ass. My kid sister in a toilet.

982
01:21:52,727 --> 01:21:56,322
- It's none of your business.
- None of my business? Fuck it ain't!

983
01:21:56,407 --> 01:21:58,637
- You can't tell me what to do!
- I am telling you!

984
01:21:58,727 --> 01:22:00,638
Listen to me. Come here.

985
01:22:02,007 --> 01:22:07,035
I catch you here again, I'm gonna
wipe you all over the fucking place.

986
01:22:07,367 --> 01:22:10,200
Yeah? Go ahead!
Do it now. I want to see it.

987
01:22:10,287 --> 01:22:12,482
- I want to see it now, big shot.
- Don't push me.

988
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:15,957
- I want to see it now!
- Don't push me! Get outta here!

989
01:22:16,207 --> 01:22:19,643
- Go outside.
- You got some nerve, Tony!

990
01:22:20,207 --> 01:22:22,641
- You think you can tell me what to do?
- Get out.

991
01:22:22,727 --> 01:22:25,605
You can't tell me what to do.
I'm not a baby anymore.

992
01:22:25,687 --> 01:22:28,440
I'll do what I want to do,
see whoever I want to see.

993
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:31,485
And if I want to fuck them,
then I'll fuck them!

994
01:22:33,047 --> 01:22:35,607
Fucking, man! Come on, man.

995
01:22:39,607 --> 01:22:42,075
What the fuck you want?
You want something?

996
01:22:43,007 --> 01:22:45,157
No. Don't touch me.

997
01:22:47,247 --> 01:22:48,839
- No.
- We've got to get out of here.

998
01:22:48,927 --> 01:22:52,636
Not there. I don't want to go out there.

999
01:22:53,367 --> 01:22:55,562
Another great night here at the Babylon?

1000
01:22:55,647 --> 01:22:57,524
Okay. All right!

1001
01:22:57,767 --> 01:23:00,281
Do another gram,
you'll all be babbling on.

1002
01:23:01,247 --> 01:23:03,920
That coke in your bra,
or are you just glad to see me?

1003
01:23:04,007 --> 01:23:05,963
A little bit of hope, I'm sure, yes.

1004
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:09,039
I'm in a good mood. I was depressed
when I got up this morning.

1005
01:23:09,127 --> 01:23:11,925
I had a dry dream, but I'm better now.

1006
01:23:26,567 --> 01:23:28,797
I do Laurel and Hardy in Spanish, too.

1007
01:23:31,327 --> 01:23:33,363
That's the height of culture,
I assure you.

1008
01:23:33,447 --> 01:23:36,757
But my favorite Cuban of all time
has to be Ricky Ricardo.

1009
01:23:37,047 --> 01:23:40,756
Mr. Babalu himself.
He had the same problem for 10 years.

1010
01:23:40,927 --> 01:23:43,487
"Lucy, don't come down to the club."

1011
01:24:14,087 --> 01:24:17,079
He's your brother. He loves you.
That's why he did it.

1012
01:24:17,167 --> 01:24:19,158
All right? He cares about you.

1013
01:24:19,247 --> 01:24:22,125
- To him, you're still his little sister...
- Right!

1014
01:24:22,207 --> 01:24:25,119
That's the problem.
He still treats me like I'm a baby.

1015
01:24:25,207 --> 01:24:26,686
I'm 20 years old now.

1016
01:24:26,767 --> 01:24:29,520
- I'm not anybody's baby.
- You're so grown-up.

1017
01:24:32,247 --> 01:24:35,478
Come on, Gina.
Put yourself in his place, okay?

1018
01:24:35,567 --> 01:24:39,037
Right now, you happen
to be the best thing in his life.

1019
01:24:39,127 --> 01:24:42,881
The only thing that's any good,
that's pure.

1020
01:24:43,767 --> 01:24:46,679
Of course he doesn't want you mixing
with those people...

1021
01:24:46,767 --> 01:24:48,120
...growing up to be like him.

1022
01:24:49,207 --> 01:24:52,404
He has this father thing for you.
Feels like he has to protect you.

1023
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:54,159
Protect me against what?

1024
01:24:54,447 --> 01:24:57,917
Against guys like that asshole
you were dancing with tonight.

1025
01:24:58,007 --> 01:25:01,920
I like Fernando.
He's a fun guy and he's nice.

1026
01:25:03,447 --> 01:25:06,245
And he knows how to treat a woman.
All right?

1027
01:25:06,527 --> 01:25:08,279
- He knows how to treat a woman?
- Yes.

1028
01:25:08,367 --> 01:25:10,358
By taking her to the toilet to make out?

1029
01:25:10,807 --> 01:25:14,322
You've been a great audience.
I got a special treat for you.

1030
01:25:14,407 --> 01:25:15,920
Here's a guy I found in the jungle.

1031
01:25:16,007 --> 01:25:18,760
From Caracas, Venezuela.
He's unlike anything you've seen.

1032
01:25:18,847 --> 01:25:22,317
Give a warm Babylon welcome
to the one and only Octavio!

1033
01:25:46,607 --> 01:25:49,997
Look around. Go out with someone
who has something on the ball...

1034
01:25:50,087 --> 01:25:52,681
...who's going somewhere in life.
- Like who?

1035
01:25:53,367 --> 01:25:56,598
Like, for instance, someone who's got
a real job, like a banker.

1036
01:25:56,687 --> 01:25:59,440
- Or, or a doctor, a lawyer...
- What about you?

1037
01:26:01,767 --> 01:26:04,804
- What are you talking about?
- Why don't you take me out?

1038
01:26:04,887 --> 01:26:08,721
- Are you crazy?
- I see the way you look at me, Manolo.

1039
01:26:09,007 --> 01:26:11,726
- Do you think I'm blind? I see.
- Come on.

1040
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,044
- What?
- Look, Gina...

1041
01:26:15,487 --> 01:26:18,001
...Tony and I are like brothers,
all right?

1042
01:26:18,367 --> 01:26:19,925
You're his kid sister.

1043
01:26:20,007 --> 01:26:21,599
- So what?
- That's where it ends.

1044
01:26:22,367 --> 01:26:25,359
- That's where it stays.
- Are you afraid of Tony?

1045
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:29,603
- You afraid of Tony's kid sister?
- I'm not afraid of anybody!

1046
01:26:29,927 --> 01:26:31,758
That's not the point here!

1047
01:28:44,607 --> 01:28:46,484
It's not for me. Don't look at me.

1048
01:28:46,567 --> 01:28:49,525
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I'm not here.

1049
01:28:49,607 --> 01:28:51,404
Really? Then where are you?

1050
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:55,766
Shit, you're weird.

1051
01:28:55,847 --> 01:28:58,077
- I'm weird?
- Hello?

1052
01:28:58,167 --> 01:29:00,476
- Hello, Miriam?
- Tony!

1053
01:29:00,567 --> 01:29:03,684
- Put Manny on, okay?
- Okay. Just a second.

1054
01:29:04,007 --> 01:29:05,235
It's Tony.

1055
01:29:08,127 --> 01:29:10,277
What are you doing, checking up on me?

1056
01:29:10,367 --> 01:29:13,916
Get your clothes on and meet me
in front of Lopez Motors in 45 minutes.

1057
01:29:14,807 --> 01:29:17,879
- What? What happened?
- Nothing we can't face.

1058
01:29:18,487 --> 01:29:20,762
All right. I'll be there.

1059
01:29:20,847 --> 01:29:24,317
- You're still on the phone. Let's go.
- Take it easy, okay?

1060
01:29:24,447 --> 01:29:27,200
I'm leaving now. Fuck.

1061
01:29:27,927 --> 01:29:29,485
- Nick?
- Yeah, Tony.

1062
01:29:29,567 --> 01:29:31,797
This is what I want you to do for me:

1063
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:34,885
You call Lopez.

1064
01:29:35,367 --> 01:29:38,916
Call him at his office at 3:00 sharp.

1065
01:29:39,767 --> 01:29:45,558
And you tell him,
"We fucked up, he got away."

1066
01:29:46,367 --> 01:29:48,801
- Okay. Yeah.
- Got it? What are you going to say?

1067
01:29:48,887 --> 01:29:50,718
"We fucked up. He got away."

1068
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:54,079
- What time?
- 3:00 sharp.

1069
01:29:56,287 --> 01:29:58,926
So when are we gonna make some money
on this thing?

1070
01:29:59,007 --> 01:30:01,840
Six months to start
don't mean shit, Larry.

1071
01:30:02,407 --> 01:30:05,558
I'm not a Rockefeller, you know.
Not yet anyway.

1072
01:30:07,127 --> 01:30:08,765
So you owe me a quarter.

1073
01:30:09,927 --> 01:30:12,361
Listen, go down
to the ball game tonight.

1074
01:30:12,767 --> 01:30:15,918
I couldn't make it. I got things.
I'll tell you about them.

1075
01:30:16,847 --> 01:30:19,998
You're kidding? What was the score?
Three to two?

1076
01:30:21,327 --> 01:30:22,521
Mel, guess what?

1077
01:30:22,607 --> 01:30:24,643
My Little League team,
the Little Lopezers...

1078
01:30:24,727 --> 01:30:26,126
...they won the division tonight.

1079
01:30:26,207 --> 01:30:28,437
That's great. Congratulations.

1080
01:30:28,807 --> 01:30:31,560
What'd you do, fix the umpire?

1081
01:30:34,327 --> 01:30:36,795
Jesus Christ.

1082
01:30:38,647 --> 01:30:40,478
Tony, what happened to you?

1083
01:30:43,207 --> 01:30:46,040
They wanted to spoil my $800 suit.

1084
01:30:47,087 --> 01:30:49,078
Who the fuck did this?

1085
01:30:49,687 --> 01:30:55,637
Hitters. I don't know.
Somebody must've brought them in.

1086
01:30:55,967 --> 01:30:57,719
I've never seen them before.

1087
01:30:58,127 --> 01:30:59,446
Hello, Mel.

1088
01:31:00,767 --> 01:31:02,485
Got an answer to this, too?

1089
01:31:03,487 --> 01:31:06,763
- There always is, Tony.
- I'll bet it was the Diaz brothers.

1090
01:31:06,847 --> 01:31:09,520
They got a beef going back
to the Sun Ray thing.

1091
01:31:10,687 --> 01:31:13,042
Maybe you're right, you know?

1092
01:31:14,967 --> 01:31:19,324
Anyway, I'm glad you made it, Tony.

1093
01:31:20,367 --> 01:31:23,484
We'll return the favor for you,
in spades.

1094
01:31:23,567 --> 01:31:26,035
No, I'll take care of this myself.

1095
01:31:31,647 --> 01:31:33,478
What is the gun for, Tony?

1096
01:31:34,367 --> 01:31:37,006
What, this? It's nothing.

1097
01:31:38,607 --> 01:31:42,680
I'm... How do you say? Paranoid.

1098
01:31:56,527 --> 01:31:58,245
You gonna answer, Frank?

1099
01:32:00,367 --> 01:32:03,882
It must be Elvira.
She got mad after we left the club.

1100
01:32:06,927 --> 01:32:08,724
I'll tell her you're not here, okay?

1101
01:32:08,807 --> 01:32:12,482
No, it's all right. I'll talk to her.

1102
01:32:20,327 --> 01:32:21,282
Hello.

1103
01:32:27,807 --> 01:32:31,117
It's all right. I'm gonna be home
in an hour. Don't worry.

1104
01:32:34,007 --> 01:32:37,079
Frank, you're a piece of shit.

1105
01:32:37,207 --> 01:32:40,677
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about...

1106
01:32:40,767 --> 01:32:43,156
...you fucking cockroach.

1107
01:32:43,287 --> 01:32:46,085
What are you talking about?
Listen to me...

1108
01:32:46,207 --> 01:32:48,323
You know what a "chaza" is, Frank?

1109
01:32:49,327 --> 01:32:52,205
That's a pig that don't fly straight.

1110
01:32:53,247 --> 01:32:54,805
Neither do you, Frank.

1111
01:32:56,287 --> 01:32:59,006
Tony, why the fuck would I hurt you?

1112
01:32:59,367 --> 01:33:03,519
I brought you in. So we had
a few differences, no big deal.

1113
01:33:04,807 --> 01:33:07,640
I gave you your start.
I was the one who believed in you.

1114
01:33:07,727 --> 01:33:09,763
I stayed loyal to you.

1115
01:33:11,967 --> 01:33:16,483
I made what I could on the side,
but I never turned on you, Frank! Never!

1116
01:33:20,567 --> 01:33:21,716
But you...

1117
01:33:25,127 --> 01:33:29,484
...a man who ain't got his word,
is a cockroach.

1118
01:33:32,927 --> 01:33:35,521
Mel. Do something, will you?

1119
01:33:39,727 --> 01:33:42,287
It's your tree, Frank.
You're sitting in it.

1120
01:33:49,767 --> 01:33:52,839
All right, Tony. I was the one.

1121
01:33:59,327 --> 01:34:01,636
Please, give me a second chance.

1122
01:34:03,367 --> 01:34:06,120
Will you do that? Please?

1123
01:34:10,767 --> 01:34:14,237
You give me a second chance,
I'll give you $ 10 million.

1124
01:34:14,727 --> 01:34:18,003
Okay? $ 10 million.

1125
01:34:18,607 --> 01:34:21,679
I got it in a vault over there
in Spain, Tony.

1126
01:34:21,767 --> 01:34:26,158
We go over there,
we get on a plane, and it's yours.

1127
01:34:26,807 --> 01:34:30,004
Okay? All of it. $ 10 million.

1128
01:34:30,847 --> 01:34:31,962
Okay, Tony?

1129
01:34:35,927 --> 01:34:37,201
Please, Tony?

1130
01:34:38,927 --> 01:34:41,999
Elvira? Elvira! You want Elvira!

1131
01:34:42,767 --> 01:34:45,679
You can have her. I'll go away.
I'm gonna disappear.

1132
01:34:45,767 --> 01:34:49,203
You'll never see me again.
Please, Tony, I don't want to die.

1133
01:34:49,287 --> 01:34:51,164
I never did nothing to nobody.

1134
01:34:51,327 --> 01:34:54,125
No, you never did nothing to nobody.

1135
01:34:54,367 --> 01:34:57,564
- You had somebody else do it for you.
- Tony, I am begging you.

1136
01:34:57,647 --> 01:35:01,276
- Get up! Get up now!
- Jesus! No! God!

1137
01:35:06,127 --> 01:35:09,642
Look. Tony, no, don't kill me, please.

1138
01:35:12,447 --> 01:35:13,846
I won't kill you.

1139
01:35:14,487 --> 01:35:16,398
- Christ, thank you.
- Get off my foot.

1140
01:35:16,487 --> 01:35:20,002
- Thank you.
- Manolo, shoot that piece of shit!

1141
01:35:41,087 --> 01:35:43,885
Every dog has his day, huh, Mel?

1142
01:35:43,967 --> 01:35:45,161
I told him...

1143
01:35:46,607 --> 01:35:48,404
...it didn't make any sense...

1144
01:35:48,487 --> 01:35:52,162
...clipping you when we had you
working for us. He wouldn't listen.

1145
01:35:52,927 --> 01:35:56,602
He got hot tonight about the broad.

1146
01:35:58,647 --> 01:36:00,046
He fucked up.

1147
01:36:00,767 --> 01:36:04,362
You, too, Mel. You fucked up.

1148
01:36:05,527 --> 01:36:07,119
Don't go too far, Tony.

1149
01:36:08,647 --> 01:36:11,320
I'm not, Mel. You are.

1150
01:36:19,807 --> 01:36:22,605
Fuck. You can't shoot a cop!

1151
01:36:24,087 --> 01:36:25,566
Whoever says you was one?

1152
01:36:25,647 --> 01:36:27,126
Wait a minute!

1153
01:36:29,127 --> 01:36:31,197
You let me go. I'll fix this up.

1154
01:36:31,727 --> 01:36:35,640
Sure, Mel.
Maybe you can hand yourself...

1155
01:36:36,007 --> 01:36:39,238
...one of them first-class tickets
to the Resurrection.

1156
01:36:39,687 --> 01:36:43,236
Fucking punk! Son of a bitch!

1157
01:36:44,927 --> 01:36:47,600
- So long, Mel. Have a good trip.
- Fuck you!

1158
01:36:54,127 --> 01:36:57,199
- Okay, come on.
- What about Ernie?

1159
01:37:06,887 --> 01:37:08,479
You want a job, Ernie?

1160
01:37:11,927 --> 01:37:14,964
- Sure, Tony.
- Okay, then you call me tomorrow.

1161
01:37:15,647 --> 01:37:17,399
Man, you got a job!

1162
01:37:18,287 --> 01:37:20,642
Tony! Thanks.

1163
01:37:54,807 --> 01:37:56,559
God, what's happened?

1164
01:37:58,727 --> 01:38:00,080
Where's Frank?

1165
01:38:01,807 --> 01:38:03,445
Where do you think?

1166
01:38:08,487 --> 01:38:13,481
Come on. Get your stuff.
You're coming with me.

1167
01:42:39,567 --> 01:42:42,877
So you come to me
with some kind of thing. Okay.

1168
01:42:42,967 --> 01:42:44,878
You propose it, I talk to you.

1169
01:42:45,327 --> 01:42:48,478
But we got a problem. I can't pay more.

1170
01:42:49,567 --> 01:42:52,445
I'm bringing in twice as much
as I ever did before.

1171
01:42:52,647 --> 01:42:55,878
We're doing $ 10 million,
$ 15 million a month. Come on.

1172
01:42:56,047 --> 01:42:58,003
That's serious money.

1173
01:42:58,287 --> 01:43:00,881
- You bank boys gotta come down a bit.
- No way.

1174
01:43:00,967 --> 01:43:04,596
- That's crazy. We can't do that.
- Then that's too bad.

1175
01:43:05,087 --> 01:43:08,238
- What am I gonna do?
- We're not a wholesale operation.

1176
01:43:08,327 --> 01:43:11,683
We're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give me...

1177
01:43:11,927 --> 01:43:14,077
...the harder it is for me to rinse.

1178
01:43:14,567 --> 01:43:16,364
That's a problem. I didn't know.

1179
01:43:16,447 --> 01:43:19,245
The fact is I can't take any more
of your money...

1180
01:43:19,327 --> 01:43:21,557
...unless I raise the rates on you.

1181
01:43:23,127 --> 01:43:24,879
- You gonna raise...
- I gotta do it.

1182
01:43:24,967 --> 01:43:28,721
- The IRS is coming...
- Don't give me that shit! Let's talk.

1183
01:43:28,807 --> 01:43:29,796
I'm talking.

1184
01:43:29,887 --> 01:43:32,276
I go low, you go high.
I know the game.

1185
01:43:32,367 --> 01:43:34,801
- This is business talk.
- Let me explain something.

1186
01:43:34,887 --> 01:43:37,242
The IRS is coming down heavy
on South Florida.

1187
01:43:37,327 --> 01:43:39,636
There was a Time magazine story
that didn't help.

1188
01:43:39,727 --> 01:43:43,242
There's a recession. I got stockholders
I got to be responsible for.

1189
01:43:43,327 --> 01:43:45,636
- I got to do it, Tony.
- You'll learn from him.

1190
01:43:45,727 --> 01:43:49,163
I got to go 10 percent on the first
$ 12 million in denominations of 20.

1191
01:43:49,247 --> 01:43:52,045
I'll go eight percent on your $ 10 bills,
six on your fives.

1192
01:43:52,127 --> 01:43:53,924
- We'll go somewhere else.
- That's it.

1193
01:43:54,007 --> 01:43:57,522
- There's no place else to go.
- Fuck you, man! Fuck you!

1194
01:43:57,607 --> 01:44:00,201
I'll fly the cash myself
to the Bahamas.

1195
01:44:00,287 --> 01:44:01,766
Once maybe. Then what?

1196
01:44:03,847 --> 01:44:06,839
You'll trust some monkey
in a Bahamian bank with $20 million...

1197
01:44:06,927 --> 01:44:10,237
...of your hard-earned dollars?
Come on, Tony. Don't be a schmuck.

1198
01:44:10,327 --> 01:44:14,320
Who else can you trust? That's why
you pay us what you do. You trust us.

1199
01:44:18,927 --> 01:44:20,599
Did you hear that guy?

1200
01:44:20,967 --> 01:44:23,527
You got to listen to him.
You'll learn something.

1201
01:44:23,607 --> 01:44:27,805
Stay with us. You're a well-liked
customer. You're in good hands with us.

1202
01:44:30,127 --> 01:44:32,402
- And I got to run.
- I'm safe but poor.

1203
01:44:33,767 --> 01:44:36,804
- How's married life treating you?
- Better than you are.

1204
01:44:38,247 --> 01:44:41,284
Say hello to the princess for me,
will you? She's beautiful.

1205
01:44:41,367 --> 01:44:44,916
- I'll see you. Take care.
- You, too.

1206
01:44:57,767 --> 01:44:59,166
That prick!

1207
01:45:00,727 --> 01:45:02,285
Fucking WASP whore.

1208
01:45:03,287 --> 01:45:06,643
Talking to me like I'm some maricon
who came over on a boat.

1209
01:45:07,967 --> 01:45:11,164
I tell you what. We don't need
that smiling motherfucker.

1210
01:45:11,247 --> 01:45:14,603
We should talk to this Jewish guy,
Seidelbaum, okay?

1211
01:45:14,927 --> 01:45:18,715
He's got his own exchange.
He charges four percent at the most.

1212
01:45:19,407 --> 01:45:20,886
And he's connected.

1213
01:45:22,047 --> 01:45:25,881
Fuck them. Mob guys. Guineas.

1214
01:45:27,327 --> 01:45:28,806
I don't trust them.

1215
01:45:47,327 --> 01:45:50,046
Did you sweep the house this month?
The cars?

1216
01:45:50,487 --> 01:45:53,957
Yeah, I told you about it. The $5,000?

1217
01:45:55,087 --> 01:45:57,521
- Look at that.
- What?

1218
01:45:58,367 --> 01:45:59,925
That cable truck there.

1219
01:46:00,007 --> 01:46:02,805
Since when does it take three days
to rig a cable?

1220
01:46:05,007 --> 01:46:07,475
What? You been watching it
for three days?

1221
01:46:09,367 --> 01:46:13,246
The thing has been there for three days.
What am I gonna do, not look at it?

1222
01:46:13,887 --> 01:46:16,640
- What, you think it's cops, right?
- I don't know.

1223
01:46:16,847 --> 01:46:19,998
Could be the Diaz brothers,
coming to get me.

1224
01:46:21,767 --> 01:46:24,327
Maybe. I'll check it out, okay?

1225
01:46:24,407 --> 01:46:28,559
You check it out. Then we're gonna blow
that fucking truck back to Colombia!

1226
01:46:29,207 --> 01:46:33,359
Come on. We're not the only dopers
living on the block.

1227
01:46:33,647 --> 01:46:34,921
Okay? Remember that.

1228
01:46:35,007 --> 01:46:38,522
That truck could be anybody and
anything. It could be a cable company...

1229
01:46:38,607 --> 01:46:41,326
You know something?
You got some fucking attitude.

1230
01:46:41,407 --> 01:46:43,967
For someone who's in charge
of my security...

1231
01:46:44,647 --> 01:46:48,799
...here are the keys to the front door.
Go down there. Give them the keys!

1232
01:46:48,887 --> 01:46:50,878
- I'm just trying to say something.
- What?

1233
01:46:50,967 --> 01:46:54,084
You're spending a lot of money
on this counter-surveillance.

1234
01:46:54,167 --> 01:46:55,156
I don't give a fuck.

1235
01:46:55,247 --> 01:46:58,922
It's 12 percent of our adjusted gross.
12 percent is not peanuts.

1236
01:46:59,007 --> 01:47:02,761
I don't give a fuck! It makes me sleep
good at night. That's what counts.

1237
01:47:02,847 --> 01:47:05,156
- Okay? You worry about it.
- I am worried about it.

1238
01:47:05,247 --> 01:47:07,886
I'm telling you. We're getting sloppy.

1239
01:47:08,367 --> 01:47:11,803
Our thinking, our fucking attitude,
you know?

1240
01:47:12,007 --> 01:47:13,725
We're not fucking hungry anymore.

1241
01:47:14,127 --> 01:47:16,322
Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.

1242
01:47:16,407 --> 01:47:18,238
New construction. New jobs.

1243
01:47:18,447 --> 01:47:21,166
Growth that's financed
by Florida Security Trust.

1244
01:47:21,247 --> 01:47:23,715
We've put your money to work
for 75 years...

1245
01:47:23,807 --> 01:47:25,798
...building a more prosperous Miami.

1246
01:47:26,207 --> 01:47:28,163
Count on us being here tomorrow.

1247
01:47:28,247 --> 01:47:31,284
That's because for 75 years
you been fucking everybody.

1248
01:47:31,567 --> 01:47:35,082
Somebody should do something
about those whores.

1249
01:47:35,407 --> 01:47:37,875
I mean, charging me 10 points
on my money.

1250
01:47:37,967 --> 01:47:41,596
They're getting away with it.
Fuck, there's no laws anymore.

1251
01:47:41,687 --> 01:47:43,086
- Forget it.
- Anything goes.

1252
01:47:43,167 --> 01:47:47,080
They been around 1,000 years.
They got all the angles figured out.

1253
01:47:47,567 --> 01:47:50,445
You know what capitalism is?
Getting fucked.

1254
01:47:50,567 --> 01:47:52,603
True capitalist if ever I met one.

1255
01:47:54,407 --> 01:47:56,079
Did you hear that?

1256
01:47:57,327 --> 01:47:59,238
How would you know, Bubblehead?

1257
01:47:59,927 --> 01:48:03,681
You ever do nothing besides get
your hair fixed and powder your nose?

1258
01:48:03,847 --> 01:48:06,281
Look at you.
You do too much of that shit.

1259
01:48:06,367 --> 01:48:08,403
Nothing exceeds like excess.

1260
01:48:08,847 --> 01:48:12,237
- You should know that, Tony.
- I should know what?

1261
01:48:13,447 --> 01:48:14,880
What should I know?

1262
01:48:15,127 --> 01:48:17,516
Why do you have to talk to me like that
all the time?

1263
01:48:17,607 --> 01:48:20,405
- Like I got to know something.
- Let me talk to you.

1264
01:48:20,567 --> 01:48:21,761
- Listen.
- What time is it?

1265
01:48:21,847 --> 01:48:23,075
This Seidelbaum.

1266
01:48:23,647 --> 01:48:24,841
Five to 7:00.

1267
01:48:25,007 --> 01:48:27,282
- Okay.
- I met with this guy Seidelbaum...

1268
01:48:27,367 --> 01:48:30,677
...the drug-related violence
that's plagued South Florida...

1269
01:48:31,127 --> 01:48:33,322
He's good for a laugh, this guy.

1270
01:48:33,407 --> 01:48:37,195
With a small law-enforcement budget
how can you put a dent...

1271
01:48:37,527 --> 01:48:41,918
...on an estimated
$ 100 billion-a-year business?

1272
01:48:42,607 --> 01:48:46,316
It seems at times all you can do
is put your finger in the dike and pray.

1273
01:48:46,407 --> 01:48:48,159
Put your fingers in a dike?

1274
01:48:48,607 --> 01:48:51,804
The only place you can get your fingers
is in some dyke.

1275
01:48:52,967 --> 01:48:57,563
Not by outlawing the substances,
but by legalizing and taxing them.

1276
01:48:57,887 --> 01:49:02,802
These voices say that will drive out
the organized crime element.

1277
01:49:03,447 --> 01:49:05,517
I am not one of those voices.

1278
01:49:05,607 --> 01:49:07,245
I know that. But you know why?

1279
01:49:07,327 --> 01:49:10,046
'Cause you got your head up your culo,
that's why.

1280
01:49:10,127 --> 01:49:12,357
That fucking guy,
he never tells the truth.

1281
01:49:12,447 --> 01:49:15,405
...splendor of our city at its best.

1282
01:49:15,687 --> 01:49:19,202
It's those guys, man! It's
the fucking bankers, the politicians...

1283
01:49:19,287 --> 01:49:21,517
...they're the ones
that wanna make coke illegal!

1284
01:49:21,607 --> 01:49:25,043
So they can make the fucking money,
and they get the fucking votes!

1285
01:49:25,127 --> 01:49:28,199
They fighting the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!

1286
01:49:28,487 --> 01:49:30,443
They fuck anything and anyone.

1287
01:49:30,527 --> 01:49:33,325
Can't you stop saying "fuck"
all the time?

1288
01:49:33,487 --> 01:49:36,047
Can't you stop talking about money?
It's boring, Tony.

1289
01:49:36,127 --> 01:49:40,006
Where's this coming from?
Boring? What's boring?

1290
01:49:40,127 --> 01:49:41,640
You're boring.

1291
01:49:42,087 --> 01:49:45,204
"Money."
That's all I hear in this house.

1292
01:49:45,327 --> 01:49:48,285
Look at the pelican fly.
Come on, pelican!

1293
01:49:48,407 --> 01:49:50,967
- Here it is.
- Frank never talked about money.

1294
01:49:55,167 --> 01:49:57,522
That's 'cause he was so smart.

1295
01:50:04,487 --> 01:50:06,079
You know what you're becoming?

1296
01:50:06,167 --> 01:50:09,443
You're an immigrant spic millionaire
who can't stop talking...

1297
01:50:09,527 --> 01:50:12,758
Who the fuck you calling a "spic,"
you white piece of bread?

1298
01:50:12,847 --> 01:50:14,280
Get out of the way of the TV!

1299
01:50:14,367 --> 01:50:17,006
Dig a hole in the yard, bury it,
and forget about it.

1300
01:50:17,087 --> 01:50:20,204
I work hard for this!
I want you to know that.

1301
01:50:24,127 --> 01:50:27,881
Somebody should've given it to you.
You would've been a nicer person.

1302
01:50:29,927 --> 01:50:31,883
Know what your problem is, Pussycat?

1303
01:50:31,967 --> 01:50:33,480
What is my problem?

1304
01:50:34,207 --> 01:50:36,596
You got nothing to do with your life.

1305
01:50:37,687 --> 01:50:40,326
Why don't you get a job or something.

1306
01:50:40,807 --> 01:50:42,638
Do something. Be a nurse.

1307
01:50:43,447 --> 01:50:46,200
Work with blind kids, lepers.
That kind of thing.

1308
01:50:47,567 --> 01:50:51,162
Anything beats lying around all day
waiting for me to fuck you!

1309
01:50:51,767 --> 01:50:54,156
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.

1310
01:50:54,247 --> 01:50:56,283
No? Frank was better.

1311
01:50:57,527 --> 01:50:58,960
You're an asshole!

1312
01:50:59,807 --> 01:51:01,684
Where you going? Come here!

1313
01:51:02,327 --> 01:51:06,286
Elvie! I was kidding!

1314
01:51:07,367 --> 01:51:08,959
I was only kidding!

1315
01:51:09,447 --> 01:51:13,486
I guess sometimes married life
is not all it's cracked up to be.

1316
01:51:13,727 --> 01:51:16,161
- Where you going?
- I got a date.

1317
01:51:17,007 --> 01:51:18,565
You got a date? Come here.

1318
01:51:23,487 --> 01:51:26,160
- What?
- This Seidelbaum thing.

1319
01:51:27,247 --> 01:51:28,760
Yeah, it's all set up.

1320
01:51:29,207 --> 01:51:32,597
Yeah, well, you forget it.
Stay out of it. I'll take care of it.

1321
01:51:33,087 --> 01:51:35,726
Stay out of it? It's my deal.
I set it up.

1322
01:51:36,047 --> 01:51:38,322
You're not a negotiator,
Manny, you know that.

1323
01:51:38,407 --> 01:51:41,558
You like the ladies more than the money.
That's your problem.

1324
01:51:41,647 --> 01:51:44,764
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm your partner, okay?

1325
01:51:44,847 --> 01:51:48,442
You're not gonna trust me with that
kind of thing, who're you gonna trust?

1326
01:51:48,527 --> 01:51:49,721
Junior partner.

1327
01:51:51,127 --> 01:51:52,116
Bullshit, man.

1328
01:51:52,207 --> 01:51:54,721
Don't talk to me about trust,
I don't like it.

1329
01:51:55,407 --> 01:51:59,480
You should listen to your wife.
She's right. You are an asshole, man!

1330
01:52:00,247 --> 01:52:02,477
Come here. Gimme a kiss. Come here.

1331
01:52:03,807 --> 01:52:05,206
Fuck you, man!

1332
01:52:06,247 --> 01:52:09,603
Who put this thing together?
Me! That's who!

1333
01:52:10,727 --> 01:52:12,843
Who do I trust? Me!

1334
01:52:13,447 --> 01:52:15,324
Fuck him. "Trust."

1335
01:52:18,087 --> 01:52:21,079
Asshole. Fuck called me an asshole.

1336
01:52:21,807 --> 01:52:23,160
I need that shit.

1337
01:52:24,847 --> 01:52:26,326
I don't need him.

1338
01:52:27,127 --> 01:52:30,802
I don't need her. Fuck them.
I don't need nobody.

1339
01:52:32,367 --> 01:52:34,483
Back then I worked in pictures
down in Colombia.

1340
01:52:34,567 --> 01:52:37,240
I was in that movie Burn.
You ever see it?

1341
01:52:37,607 --> 01:52:40,917
You saw me with Marlon Brando.
You know we're good friends.

1342
01:52:41,007 --> 01:52:43,316
- I was his driver.
- No shit?

1343
01:52:43,407 --> 01:52:46,001
- Brando.
- They shot it there. Cartagena.

1344
01:52:47,527 --> 01:52:50,678
Gillo Pontecorvo. He was the director.
Italian guy.

1345
01:52:50,767 --> 01:52:54,316
- Tell me about him.
- I also know Paul Newman.

1346
01:52:54,727 --> 01:52:56,763
- I worked with him in Tucson.
- No kidding?

1347
01:52:56,847 --> 01:52:58,758
Do you know Benny Alvarez?

1348
01:52:58,887 --> 01:53:01,242
In Tucson. Benny Alvarez?

1349
01:53:01,607 --> 01:53:04,201
- Subtotal.
- No?

1350
01:53:06,807 --> 01:53:08,160
He's a nice guy.

1351
01:53:08,727 --> 01:53:12,561
$283,107.65.

1352
01:53:15,247 --> 01:53:17,158
You want a company check here?

1353
01:53:18,567 --> 01:53:22,355
I got $284,600.

1354
01:53:22,487 --> 01:53:25,763
That's just not possible.
The machine don't make mistakes.

1355
01:53:29,207 --> 01:53:31,277
- Let's count it again.
- No. Come on.

1356
01:53:31,367 --> 01:53:34,598
Business is business. Come on.
You're talking $ 1,500 here.

1357
01:53:35,647 --> 01:53:38,639
Okay, you keep the change.
Okay. I don't give a shit.

1358
01:53:40,327 --> 01:53:42,522
- I'll count it again for you.
- No, come on.

1359
01:53:42,607 --> 01:53:45,280
This check here,
where does this check go?

1360
01:53:48,567 --> 01:53:50,956
- Montana Realty Company.
- Montana what?

1361
01:53:51,367 --> 01:53:52,959
Montana Realty Company.

1362
01:53:53,087 --> 01:53:56,636
Montana Realty Company.

1363
01:53:56,887 --> 01:54:00,357
- That's $284,000.
- $284,600.

1364
01:54:01,287 --> 01:54:03,721
How come you don't know
Benny Alvarez?

1365
01:54:03,807 --> 01:54:08,085
- Me and Benny have lunch together.
- He probably knows me.

1366
01:54:08,407 --> 01:54:09,886
You ask him.

1367
01:54:27,207 --> 01:54:28,720
We're up to what?

1368
01:54:30,367 --> 01:54:36,203
Seven checks. $ 1,325,623.

1369
01:54:38,887 --> 01:54:41,640
$200,000 more.
We ought to take a leak.

1370
01:54:41,727 --> 01:54:42,762
Freeze!

1371
01:54:42,847 --> 01:54:45,805
- Get your hands up!
- Go against the wall and turn around.

1372
01:54:45,887 --> 01:54:47,002
You're not kidding.

1373
01:54:47,087 --> 01:54:50,045
You're under arrest
for violation of the RICO Statute.

1374
01:54:50,167 --> 01:54:54,240
"You have the right to remain silent.
Anything said will be used against you."

1375
01:54:54,327 --> 01:54:57,637
- How do I know you guys are cops?
- What's that say, asshole?

1376
01:54:59,087 --> 01:55:01,965
That pretty good, man.
Where'd you get that?

1377
01:55:02,327 --> 01:55:05,524
You call yourself a Cuban?
You make a real Cuban throw up!

1378
01:55:05,607 --> 01:55:07,677
Call your dog off me, Seidelbaum.

1379
01:55:08,047 --> 01:55:11,084
- I want to call my lawyer.
- Lot of good he's gonna do you.

1380
01:55:11,247 --> 01:55:13,397
You see that eye there in the clock?

1381
01:55:13,727 --> 01:55:15,604
Say, "Hi, honey."

1382
01:55:16,247 --> 01:55:20,240
That's pretty cute. Look at that.
You jerk off in front of us, Seidelbaum?

1383
01:55:20,607 --> 01:55:24,759
I was supposed to meet this chick at
3:00. You're a fucking pain in the ass.

1384
01:55:25,007 --> 01:55:26,725
All right, Danny, kill it.

1385
01:55:27,887 --> 01:55:30,355
You understand the rights
I've given you?

1386
01:55:30,527 --> 01:55:33,564
I know all that bullshit, Seidelbaum!
Save your breath.

1387
01:55:34,047 --> 01:55:36,686
You got nothing on me.
You know it! I know it!

1388
01:55:37,247 --> 01:55:39,522
I'm changing dollar bills, that's all.

1389
01:55:39,727 --> 01:55:42,958
You want to waste my time?
Okay. I call my lawyer.

1390
01:55:43,927 --> 01:55:47,397
He's the best lawyer in Miami.
He's such a good lawyer...

1391
01:55:47,927 --> 01:55:51,476
...that by tomorrow morning,
you gonna be working in Alaska.

1392
01:55:53,247 --> 01:55:54,521
So dress warm.

1393
01:55:59,327 --> 01:56:02,080
Give me a check for $ 100,000,
plus $300 cash.

1394
01:56:02,967 --> 01:56:05,561
I guarantee you walk
on the conspiracy charge.

1395
01:56:06,407 --> 01:56:11,117
But they're gonna come back at us
on a tax evasion, and they'll get it.

1396
01:56:15,687 --> 01:56:18,042
So, what am I looking at here?

1397
01:56:20,487 --> 01:56:22,603
Five years. You'll be out in three.

1398
01:56:22,687 --> 01:56:25,247
Maybe less, if I can make a deal.

1399
01:56:26,807 --> 01:56:28,286
Three fucking years!

1400
01:56:30,327 --> 01:56:31,555
For what?

1401
01:56:32,807 --> 01:56:36,163
Washing money? The fucking country
was built on washed money.

1402
01:56:36,247 --> 01:56:39,842
- Can't be that bad. It's not like Cuba.
- What the fuck you talking?

1403
01:56:39,927 --> 01:56:43,044
- The jails are like hotels.
- You kidding me or what?

1404
01:56:43,247 --> 01:56:45,966
- You fucking high or what?
- I'll delay the trial.

1405
01:56:46,207 --> 01:56:49,165
Ayear and a half, two years.
You won't even start...

1406
01:56:49,247 --> 01:56:52,159
Fuck you, man!
I'm not going back in any cage, okay?

1407
01:56:52,247 --> 01:56:53,999
No way. I been there.

1408
01:56:59,327 --> 01:57:00,646
Okay, look.

1409
01:57:02,887 --> 01:57:06,960
I give you $400,000 more.
Okay, now that's $800,000.

1410
01:57:07,407 --> 01:57:10,444
With that kind of money,
you can buy the supreme court.

1411
01:57:13,007 --> 01:57:16,317
Tony, the law has to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt.

1412
01:57:17,247 --> 01:57:21,240
I'm an expert at raising that doubt.
But when you a got a $ 1,300,000...

1413
01:57:21,367 --> 01:57:24,439
...undeclared dollars
staring into a videotape camera...

1414
01:57:25,087 --> 01:57:28,921
...honey, baby, it's hard to convince
a jury you found it in a taxicab.

1415
01:57:51,567 --> 01:57:55,082
I'm so glad you could come on such
short notice. I really appreciate it.

1416
01:57:55,167 --> 01:57:56,805
- It's okay.
- How's Elvira?

1417
01:57:57,167 --> 01:58:00,125
- Great. How's your wife?
- Three more months.

1418
01:58:00,287 --> 01:58:02,596
- Yeah? Congratulations.
- How about you?

1419
01:58:02,687 --> 01:58:05,281
When you gonna have another Tony
to take your place?

1420
01:58:05,367 --> 01:58:08,245
- I'm working on it.
- You have to work harder. Come.

1421
01:58:08,407 --> 01:58:10,682
I want you to meet some of my friends.

1422
01:58:15,407 --> 01:58:18,638
This is Pedro Quinn, chairman
of the Andes Sugar Corporation.

1423
01:58:18,727 --> 01:58:21,116
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

1424
01:58:21,207 --> 01:58:24,438
General Edward Strasser,
Commander of the First Army Corps.

1425
01:58:26,087 --> 01:58:27,042
Pleasure.

1426
01:58:27,127 --> 01:58:31,996
This is Ariel Bleyer
with the Ministry of the Interior here.

1427
01:58:34,127 --> 01:58:37,881
And here is our friend,
Charles Goodson from Washington.

1428
01:58:38,167 --> 01:58:40,681
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do, Mr. Montana?

1429
01:58:41,687 --> 01:58:43,120
Sit here, Tony.

1430
01:58:46,727 --> 01:58:47,955
Gentlemen.

1431
01:58:51,727 --> 01:58:55,561
I would like to discuss something
that is of interest to all of us here.

1432
01:58:56,807 --> 01:58:58,479
You have a problem, Tony.

1433
01:58:59,287 --> 01:59:02,359
We have a problem.

1434
01:59:03,487 --> 01:59:06,126
I think together
we can solve all our problems.

1435
01:59:08,287 --> 01:59:10,721
We all know you have tax troubles
in your country...

1436
01:59:10,807 --> 01:59:13,401
...and that you may have to do
a little time.

1437
01:59:14,247 --> 01:59:15,805
We have friends in Washington...

1438
01:59:15,887 --> 01:59:18,560
...who assure us
these troubles can be taken care of.

1439
01:59:18,647 --> 01:59:22,037
You may have to pay some back taxes,
a big fine...

1440
01:59:22,807 --> 01:59:24,798
...but there will be no prison.

1441
01:59:25,447 --> 01:59:26,357
Okay.

1442
01:59:27,327 --> 01:59:29,204
So what's your problem, Alex?

1443
01:59:30,207 --> 01:59:31,925
I'll show you my problem.

1444
01:59:32,447 --> 01:59:35,484
I've heard about financial support
your government receives...

1445
01:59:35,567 --> 01:59:37,319
...from the drug industry in Bolivia.

1446
01:59:37,407 --> 01:59:42,117
Well, the irony of this is that
this money, which is in the billions...

1447
01:59:42,327 --> 01:59:43,999
...is coming from your country.

1448
01:59:44,087 --> 01:59:49,559
You are the major purchaser of
our national product which is cocaine.

1449
01:59:49,647 --> 01:59:51,797
On one hand, you're saying
the US government...

1450
01:59:51,887 --> 01:59:56,005
...is spending millions to eliminate
the flow of drugs onto our streets.

1451
01:59:56,287 --> 02:00:00,326
At the same time, we are doing business
with the same government...

1452
02:00:00,887 --> 02:00:03,321
...that is flooding our streets
with cocaine.

1453
02:00:03,407 --> 02:00:05,875
Let me show you
a few of the other characters...

1454
02:00:05,967 --> 02:00:08,356
...that are involved
in this tragicomedy.

1455
02:00:08,447 --> 02:00:13,521
My organization just recently traced
a large purchase by this man.

1456
02:00:14,167 --> 02:00:17,603
This charming face here
belongs to General Cucombre.

1457
02:00:17,887 --> 02:00:21,004
He is the Minister of the Defense
of Bolivia, my country.

1458
02:00:21,487 --> 02:00:23,796
And General Cucombre just
a couple months ago...

1459
02:00:23,887 --> 02:00:28,085
...bought a $ 12 million villa
on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.

1460
02:00:28,167 --> 02:00:31,364
Now, if Cucombre is supposed to be
the Bolivian Defense Minister...

1461
02:00:31,447 --> 02:00:35,122
...what is he doing living
in Switzerland? Guarding cash registers?

1462
02:00:36,167 --> 02:00:40,319
This man here, Alejandro Sosa,
a very interesting character.

1463
02:00:40,567 --> 02:00:44,446
He's a wealthy landowner,
educated in England, very good family.

1464
02:00:45,007 --> 02:00:48,636
But this man is the business brain
and drug overlord...

1465
02:00:49,087 --> 02:00:51,726
...of an empire that stretches
across the Andes.

1466
02:00:51,807 --> 02:00:54,241
He's not your ordinary drug dealer.

1467
02:00:54,807 --> 02:00:57,321
Well, discussing it openly...

1468
02:00:58,407 --> 02:01:00,762
He's scheduled for 60 Minutes next.

1469
02:01:01,327 --> 02:01:06,640
He is going on French, British,
Italian, Japanese television.

1470
02:01:07,207 --> 02:01:10,005
People everywhere
are starting to listen to him.

1471
02:01:10,447 --> 02:01:12,085
It's embarrassing, Tony.

1472
02:01:14,207 --> 02:01:16,402
That is our problem.

1473
02:01:18,927 --> 02:01:21,077
You remember Alberto, don't you?

1474
02:01:22,367 --> 02:01:24,005
How could I forget him?

1475
02:01:24,687 --> 02:01:27,918
Alberto is an expert
in the disposal business.

1476
02:01:28,727 --> 02:01:31,002
He's going to help us fix our problem.

1477
02:01:32,887 --> 02:01:34,764
But he doesn't speak English.

1478
02:01:35,487 --> 02:01:38,365
He doesn't know his way
around the States too well.

1479
02:01:38,607 --> 02:01:40,484
He needs a little help.

1480
02:01:42,607 --> 02:01:44,438
Is that a problem, Tony?

1481
02:01:50,127 --> 02:01:51,685
No problem.

1482
02:01:54,127 --> 02:01:55,196
Good.

1483
02:02:09,807 --> 02:02:13,641
So what's the big mystery
with the Bolivian situation?

1484
02:02:14,007 --> 02:02:16,885
You gonna tell me what happened
with Sosa, or what?

1485
02:02:17,127 --> 02:02:20,244
A lot of bullshit, that's what happened.

1486
02:02:21,127 --> 02:02:22,242
Politics.

1487
02:02:26,807 --> 02:02:29,958
I want you to stay down here
for a while.

1488
02:02:31,127 --> 02:02:32,765
Run things for me.

1489
02:02:33,487 --> 02:02:35,557
I gotta go to New York next week.

1490
02:02:41,647 --> 02:02:42,875
Fuck this, man.

1491
02:02:42,967 --> 02:02:45,765
I don't like it, man.
I don't like this at all.

1492
02:02:45,847 --> 02:02:47,439
You don't like it?

1493
02:02:50,367 --> 02:02:53,518
You the one that got me into this mess
in the first place.

1494
02:02:53,607 --> 02:02:57,156
With that fucking Seidelbaum,
that right?

1495
02:02:57,247 --> 02:03:00,683
With Seidelbaum? What does Seidelbaum
have to do with Sosa?

1496
02:03:00,767 --> 02:03:03,406
How do you connect those two?

1497
02:03:03,887 --> 02:03:06,401
Why don't you eat your food?
What's wrong with it?

1498
02:03:06,487 --> 02:03:08,443
I'm not hungry.

1499
02:03:09,087 --> 02:03:11,965
- You're not hungry?
- Do you even know about the trial?

1500
02:03:12,127 --> 02:03:16,086
- What did you order it for, then?
- I lost my appetite.

1501
02:03:21,047 --> 02:03:24,676
Do you even know that Sheffield said
he can get you a postponement?

1502
02:03:31,767 --> 02:03:35,760
Is this it? That's what
it's all about, Manny?

1503
02:03:38,847 --> 02:03:44,524
Eating, drinking, fucking, sucking?

1504
02:03:44,607 --> 02:03:47,246
- Come on, man.
- Snorting?

1505
02:03:47,487 --> 02:03:48,602
Then what?

1506
02:03:50,207 --> 02:03:51,959
Tell me. Then what?

1507
02:03:52,887 --> 02:03:57,199
You're 50. You got a bag for a belly.

1508
02:03:58,567 --> 02:04:01,206
You got tits, you need a bra.

1509
02:04:02,007 --> 02:04:03,520
They got hair on them.

1510
02:04:04,687 --> 02:04:07,485
You got a liver,
and they got spots on it...

1511
02:04:07,567 --> 02:04:09,956
...and you're eating
this fucking shit...

1512
02:04:10,447 --> 02:04:13,837
...and you're looking like
these rich fucking mummies in here.

1513
02:04:14,047 --> 02:04:16,641
Come on. It's not so bad.
It could be worse.

1514
02:04:17,287 --> 02:04:19,676
- Is this what it's all about?
- Forget it.

1515
02:04:19,847 --> 02:04:22,725
This what I work for? Tell me.

1516
02:04:28,047 --> 02:04:29,241
Look at that.

1517
02:04:30,287 --> 02:04:31,561
Ajunkie.

1518
02:04:33,287 --> 02:04:37,485
I got a fucking junkie for a wife.
She don't eat nothing.

1519
02:04:38,607 --> 02:04:42,202
Sleeps all day
with them black shades on.

1520
02:04:43,807 --> 02:04:46,401
- Wakes up with a Quaalude...
- Don't pick on her, man.

1521
02:04:46,487 --> 02:04:50,036
...and who won't fuck me
'cause she's in a coma.

1522
02:04:51,647 --> 02:04:54,002
I can't even have a kid with her, Manny.

1523
02:04:54,087 --> 02:04:59,639
Her womb is so polluted, I can't even
have a fucking little baby with her!

1524
02:04:59,727 --> 02:05:01,957
You son of a bitch!

1525
02:05:02,847 --> 02:05:04,439
You fuck!

1526
02:05:04,807 --> 02:05:08,356
- You shouldn't talk like that.
- How dare you talk to me like that!

1527
02:05:09,607 --> 02:05:11,882
What makes you
so much better than me?

1528
02:05:12,287 --> 02:05:13,561
- What do you do?
- Don't worry.

1529
02:05:13,647 --> 02:05:17,083
You deal drugs and you kill people.
That's wonderful, Tony.

1530
02:05:17,727 --> 02:05:20,002
Real contribution to human history.

1531
02:05:20,087 --> 02:05:22,806
- Go ahead. Tell everybody.
- You want a kid?

1532
02:05:22,887 --> 02:05:27,005
- Tell the world.
- What kind of a father would you make?

1533
02:05:28,327 --> 02:05:30,682
Gonna drive him to school
in the mornings?

1534
02:05:30,767 --> 02:05:34,203
Are you even gonna be alive
by the time the kid goes to school?

1535
02:05:35,647 --> 02:05:38,525
- You don't know how to be a husband!
- Sit down before I...

1536
02:05:38,607 --> 02:05:42,680
Do we ever go anywhere without having
six thugs hanging around all the time?

1537
02:05:42,767 --> 02:05:46,555
I have Nick "The Pig" as a friend.

1538
02:05:48,087 --> 02:05:50,965
What kind of life is that?

1539
02:05:55,247 --> 02:05:56,646
Can't you see...

1540
02:05:58,887 --> 02:06:01,481
...what we're becoming, Tony?
We're losers.

1541
02:06:02,407 --> 02:06:04,557
We're not winners, we're losers.

1542
02:06:05,527 --> 02:06:09,440
- Go home. You're stoned.
- I'm not stoned, you're stoned.

1543
02:06:09,687 --> 02:06:11,996
- Get her out of here.
- Come on.

1544
02:06:14,287 --> 02:06:16,084
I'm not going home with you.

1545
02:06:17,527 --> 02:06:19,518
I'm not going home with anybody.

1546
02:06:21,287 --> 02:06:22,766
I'm going home alone.

1547
02:06:28,207 --> 02:06:29,481
I'm leaving you.

1548
02:06:31,887 --> 02:06:33,798
I don't need this shit anymore.

1549
02:06:34,287 --> 02:06:37,245
Okay, but I'll walk you out.
I'll take her home in a cab.

1550
02:06:37,327 --> 02:06:39,443
Let her go.

1551
02:06:40,047 --> 02:06:42,766
Another Quaalude,
she gonna love me again.

1552
02:06:50,047 --> 02:06:51,560
What're you looking at?

1553
02:06:58,247 --> 02:07:00,522
You're all a bunch of fucking assholes.

1554
02:07:01,807 --> 02:07:03,240
You know why?

1555
02:07:05,047 --> 02:07:08,164
You don't have the guts
to be what you want to be.

1556
02:07:11,567 --> 02:07:13,797
You need people like me.

1557
02:07:19,247 --> 02:07:23,240
You need people like me
so you can point your fucking fingers...

1558
02:07:23,927 --> 02:07:26,441
...and say, "That's the bad guy."

1559
02:07:29,007 --> 02:07:29,917
So...

1560
02:07:31,047 --> 02:07:32,605
...what does that make you?

1561
02:07:33,207 --> 02:07:34,196
Good?

1562
02:07:36,967 --> 02:07:38,639
You're not good.

1563
02:07:40,767 --> 02:07:42,598
You just know how to hide...

1564
02:07:44,247 --> 02:07:45,475
...how to lie.

1565
02:07:48,047 --> 02:07:51,323
Me, I don't have that problem.

1566
02:07:52,967 --> 02:07:56,039
Me, I always tell the truth.

1567
02:07:57,687 --> 02:07:59,245
Even when I lie.

1568
02:08:08,127 --> 02:08:10,561
So say good night to the bad guy!

1569
02:08:11,167 --> 02:08:12,361
Come on.

1570
02:08:14,487 --> 02:08:18,321
The last time you gonna see a bad guy
like this again, let me tell you.

1571
02:08:19,807 --> 02:08:23,038
Come on. Make way for the bad guy.

1572
02:08:24,447 --> 02:08:26,836
There's a bad guy coming through!

1573
02:08:27,567 --> 02:08:29,159
Better get out of his way!

1574
02:09:53,087 --> 02:09:56,636
No. You tell Sheffield
to keep his nose out of it.

1575
02:09:56,847 --> 02:10:00,044
There's gonna be no trial.
I got it all under control now.

1576
02:10:00,447 --> 02:10:02,438
Just tell him to stay out of it!

1577
02:10:02,967 --> 02:10:05,276
Okay, what about Elvira? Did she call?

1578
02:10:08,527 --> 02:10:09,880
Yeah, all right.

1579
02:10:24,687 --> 02:10:26,359
Tony, everything go okay?

1580
02:10:26,687 --> 02:10:28,405
Yeah, everything is roses.

1581
02:10:32,127 --> 02:10:33,879
Tony, what time do you got?

1582
02:10:34,047 --> 02:10:36,925
- Ten to.
- Ten to.

1583
02:10:37,007 --> 02:10:39,475
- Where is this guy, man?
- I gotta call Manny again.

1584
02:10:40,767 --> 02:10:42,485
You don't tell me what to do here!

1585
02:10:42,567 --> 02:10:44,956
- He's coming out.
- He's coming.

1586
02:10:46,007 --> 02:10:48,282
- I don't give a fuck.
- It's him, man.

1587
02:10:55,487 --> 02:10:57,603
I don't care where you blow him up.

1588
02:10:58,207 --> 02:10:59,640
Tell me when, okay?

1589
02:11:01,367 --> 02:11:04,086
You just tell me when.
That's all I care about.

1590
02:11:13,647 --> 02:11:18,163
I heard you the first time.
One time. That's all you gotta tell me.

1591
02:11:21,927 --> 02:11:24,077
This fucking guy, I'm telling you.

1592
02:11:26,607 --> 02:11:28,279
Look. Here he comes.

1593
02:11:31,087 --> 02:11:33,078
Where's he going?

1594
02:11:33,287 --> 02:11:34,925
What's he doing that way?

1595
02:11:45,847 --> 02:11:47,439
What the fuck he doing?

1596
02:12:00,687 --> 02:12:02,678
What the fuck is that? Come here.

1597
02:12:02,767 --> 02:12:04,758
You said she took the kids
in the other car!

1598
02:12:04,847 --> 02:12:08,556
She did every fucking day.
I don't know what's going on.

1599
02:12:10,887 --> 02:12:14,562
No fucking way.
No fucking way. That's it!

1600
02:12:26,687 --> 02:12:28,359
This fucking guy.

1601
02:13:04,287 --> 02:13:06,198
Fuck you, you fucking vulture.

1602
02:13:10,167 --> 02:13:14,046
Two little kids in the car.
This is so fucking bad.

1603
02:13:14,847 --> 02:13:16,758
This is so fucking bad.

1604
02:13:20,487 --> 02:13:22,478
I see them, all right? I see them!

1605
02:13:27,527 --> 02:13:29,165
Shut the fuck up, okay?

1606
02:13:41,647 --> 02:13:45,162
You don't have the guts to look them
in the eye when you kill them.

1607
02:13:45,327 --> 02:13:46,601
You gotta hide with that shit.

1608
02:13:47,887 --> 02:13:49,525
He's getting up. Let's do it.

1609
02:13:49,607 --> 02:13:51,165
Make you feel good?

1610
02:13:51,647 --> 02:13:54,957
Make you feel good to kill a mama
and her kids. Make you feel big.

1611
02:13:56,327 --> 02:13:57,680
Like you big man! Fuck you!

1612
02:13:58,807 --> 02:14:02,322
What do you think I am?
You think I kill two kids and a woman?

1613
02:14:02,487 --> 02:14:05,763
Fuck that!
I don't need that shit in my life!

1614
02:14:07,847 --> 02:14:10,315
You die, motherfucker!

1615
02:14:14,607 --> 02:14:18,202
What do you think I am?
You think I'm a fucking worm like you?

1616
02:14:18,487 --> 02:14:21,877
I told you, man!
I told you, don't fuck with me!

1617
02:14:22,087 --> 02:14:24,043
I told you, no fucking kids!

1618
02:14:24,407 --> 02:14:28,366
No, but you wouldn't listen!
You stupid fuck! Look at you now.

1619
02:14:33,647 --> 02:14:35,842
Nick, where the fuck you been?

1620
02:14:37,087 --> 02:14:38,440
On a delivery?

1621
02:14:39,247 --> 02:14:42,796
Where the hell is Manny?
I been calling all over. Where is he?

1622
02:14:43,007 --> 02:14:46,636
I don't know, Tony.
He's been gone the last couple of days.

1623
02:14:46,727 --> 02:14:49,605
- He didn't say nothing.
- He's gone? What? Where?

1624
02:14:49,767 --> 02:14:53,521
I left him in fucking charge, man!
Where the fuck is he?

1625
02:14:53,647 --> 02:14:55,638
You can't trust nobody anymore!

1626
02:14:55,927 --> 02:14:58,839
I don't know, Tony. He just took off.

1627
02:14:59,327 --> 02:15:01,477
- He didn't say nothing.
- He took off?

1628
02:15:02,247 --> 02:15:05,478
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right! I'm pissed!

1629
02:15:05,567 --> 02:15:08,604
When I get back there,
I'll kick some ass all over the place!

1630
02:15:08,687 --> 02:15:11,520
- When you coming back?
- I'm coming back tonight!

1631
02:15:11,607 --> 02:15:13,598
This fucking cocksucker.

1632
02:15:14,167 --> 02:15:18,160
Tony, your mama called. Gina's gone.

1633
02:15:20,367 --> 02:15:23,439
- Gone? Where?
- She got to see you right away.

1634
02:15:23,527 --> 02:15:27,076
Okay, just tell her
I'll call her tonight.

1635
02:15:27,287 --> 02:15:30,324
Listen to me.
What about Elvie? She call?

1636
02:15:30,447 --> 02:15:32,483
- No.
- No?

1637
02:15:32,567 --> 02:15:34,364
Okay, listen to me.

1638
02:15:34,487 --> 02:15:38,878
If she calls, just tell her I love her.
Okay? Just tell her that.

1639
02:16:01,727 --> 02:16:02,842
You hear from Manny?

1640
02:16:02,927 --> 02:16:05,282
No. Your mama called,
she gotta see you.

1641
02:16:05,407 --> 02:16:09,036
And Sosa has been ringing
every half hour. He sounds pissed.

1642
02:16:09,167 --> 02:16:11,840
- Get him on the phone. Elvie call?
- No.

1643
02:16:15,087 --> 02:16:17,920
You keep trying Manny.
I want that cocksucker here.

1644
02:16:18,007 --> 02:16:20,123
- I want him here now! Okay?
- Okay.

1645
02:16:20,207 --> 02:16:23,244
Come on. Go ahead, get him!
Let's go. Come on!

1646
02:16:37,327 --> 02:16:41,559
Yeah? Mama. Yeah, I know. I know.

1647
02:16:42,447 --> 02:16:45,007
They told me.

1648
02:16:45,087 --> 02:16:46,964
Okay. I'm coming over.

1649
02:16:47,047 --> 02:16:49,766
I'll be over to see you.
I'll be over, yeah.

1650
02:16:53,727 --> 02:16:55,604
Put it on the speaker.

1651
02:17:05,247 --> 02:17:08,045
What happened, Tony?

1652
02:17:08,207 --> 02:17:11,005
- Alex, how you doing?
- What happened?

1653
02:17:11,087 --> 02:17:13,476
We had some problems.

1654
02:17:15,487 --> 02:17:18,001
- Alex?
- Tony, what happened?

1655
02:17:21,167 --> 02:17:23,317
- We had a little problem.
- I heard.

1656
02:17:23,407 --> 02:17:24,522
How you hear that?

1657
02:17:24,607 --> 02:17:26,598
Our friend gave a speech at the UN.

1658
02:17:26,687 --> 02:17:29,520
He was not supposed to give that speech.

1659
02:17:31,807 --> 02:17:35,004
Well, your guy, Alberto,
he's a piece of shit.

1660
02:17:35,087 --> 02:17:38,762
I told him to do something. He didn't
listen, so I canceled his contract.

1661
02:17:38,847 --> 02:17:41,202
My partners and I are pissed off, Tony.

1662
02:17:41,727 --> 02:17:43,445
That's okay. No big deal.

1663
02:17:43,647 --> 02:17:46,559
There's other Albertos.
We'll do it next month.

1664
02:17:46,647 --> 02:17:48,638
No, Tony, you can't do that.

1665
02:17:49,287 --> 02:17:52,165
They found what was under the car, Tony.

1666
02:17:53,007 --> 02:17:55,567
Now our friend has got security
up the ass...

1667
02:17:55,847 --> 02:17:59,237
...and the heat is gonna come down hard
on my partners and me.

1668
02:18:00,007 --> 02:18:01,884
There's not gonna be a next time...

1669
02:18:01,967 --> 02:18:05,516
...you dumb cocksucker! You blew it!
- Take it easy when you talk to me.

1670
02:18:05,807 --> 02:18:10,119
I told you a long time ago, you
fucking little monkey, not to fuck me!

1671
02:18:10,207 --> 02:18:12,243
Who the fuck
you think you're talking to?

1672
02:18:12,327 --> 02:18:13,476
You want to fuck with...

1673
02:18:13,567 --> 02:18:16,843
Who the fuck you think I am,
your fucking bellboy?

1674
02:18:17,767 --> 02:18:21,157
You want to go to war?
We take you to war, okay?

1675
02:18:22,247 --> 02:18:24,556
Alex, you there? Hey!

1676
02:18:24,687 --> 02:18:28,043
He's not there. Calmate, man.

1677
02:18:29,367 --> 02:18:33,076
She got a place of her own.
She don't tell me where.

1678
02:18:33,327 --> 02:18:38,242
One night, I follow her in a taxi. She
goes to a fancy house, Coconut Grove.

1679
02:18:39,247 --> 02:18:40,965
- Where'd she get the money?
- You!

1680
02:18:41,047 --> 02:18:43,925
You were giving her the money!
You see what you do to her?

1681
02:18:44,007 --> 02:18:46,282
- I don't give her that kind of money.
- You did!

1682
02:18:46,367 --> 02:18:49,359
- One time, $ 1,000 you gave her.
- Was a guy with her?

1683
02:18:50,047 --> 02:18:52,117
I don't know.

1684
02:18:52,207 --> 02:18:54,323
There was this car in the driveway.

1685
02:18:54,407 --> 02:18:56,762
I know if I go there, she'll kill me.
She's like you.

1686
02:18:56,847 --> 02:18:58,803
Where's the place? Where is it?

1687
02:18:59,007 --> 02:19:03,080
400 something. Citrus Drive.

1688
02:19:03,167 --> 02:19:05,601
- 400 what?
- 409, I think.

1689
02:19:05,687 --> 02:19:08,759
You gotta talk to her, Antonio.
She don't listen to me.

1690
02:19:08,847 --> 02:19:11,884
She says to me, "Mira, shut up!
Mind your own business."

1691
02:19:11,967 --> 02:19:16,518
Exactly like you do. Ever since you
came back, she's been getting this way.

1692
02:19:16,647 --> 02:19:19,207
- I gotta go.
- Why do you have to hurt everything?

1693
02:19:19,287 --> 02:19:21,243
Why do you have to destroy...

1694
02:19:21,327 --> 02:19:23,522
...everything that comes your way?

1695
02:19:27,407 --> 02:19:29,796
409 Citrus Drive.

1696
02:19:30,087 --> 02:19:33,079
- Tony, I can't find Manny anywhere.
- Fuck!

1697
02:19:33,487 --> 02:19:36,160
Okay. Listen, Boss, I'll try again.

1698
02:20:07,847 --> 02:20:10,964
You stay here. Keep trying Manny, okay?

1699
02:22:05,607 --> 02:22:09,998
We got married just yesterday.
We were gonna surprise you.

1700
02:22:15,527 --> 02:22:16,960
Jesus, Tony.

1701
02:22:17,407 --> 02:22:20,717
Tony, we gotta get outta here, man.
We gotta get outta here.

1702
02:22:21,247 --> 02:22:22,839
Go get Gina.

1703
02:22:30,727 --> 02:22:32,558
No!

1704
02:22:38,207 --> 02:22:41,005
No, Gina. Come on, Gina. No!

1705
02:22:41,087 --> 02:22:42,645
God!

1706
02:22:50,647 --> 02:22:54,242
Tony, we can't stay here. We gotta go.
We gotta get out of here.

1707
02:23:32,447 --> 02:23:33,800
Come on, Gina.

1708
02:23:37,247 --> 02:23:39,397
Here we go. It's gonna be okay.

1709
02:23:39,527 --> 02:23:41,518
- You got her?
- I got her.

1710
02:24:08,007 --> 02:24:11,124
No! This is Tony's place! Let me go!

1711
02:24:54,607 --> 02:24:57,405
We put some pills into her.
She's gonna be all right, Tony.

1712
02:24:57,487 --> 02:24:59,125
She's cooling down. Right?

1713
02:24:59,207 --> 02:25:02,040
- She's gonna be fine. Just fine.
- Right.

1714
02:25:04,567 --> 02:25:06,319
What are we gonna do now?

1715
02:25:10,607 --> 02:25:11,756
Do?

1716
02:25:16,407 --> 02:25:17,999
We're going to war.

1717
02:25:19,167 --> 02:25:21,237
That's what we're gonna do.

1718
02:25:24,647 --> 02:25:27,605
We're gonna eat that Sosa for breakfast!

1719
02:25:29,847 --> 02:25:32,361
Close that fucker down.

1720
02:25:38,007 --> 02:25:39,963
Tony. Take it easy.

1721
02:25:47,367 --> 02:25:50,564
All right, Ernie. Let's go.
We'll take care of the house.

1722
02:26:58,687 --> 02:27:02,202
Come on. This cocksucker's
gonna run all over you.

1723
02:27:19,047 --> 02:27:21,641
Come on. I'll bury these cocksuckers.

1724
02:27:30,407 --> 02:27:32,967
We gotta get organized here.

1725
02:27:43,487 --> 02:27:46,797
Fuck! Manny.

1726
02:27:53,327 --> 02:27:55,238
How the fuck I do that?

1727
02:27:59,207 --> 02:28:01,516
How the fuck I do that, Manny?

1728
02:29:37,767 --> 02:29:39,803
Is this what you want, Tony?

1729
02:29:50,527 --> 02:29:53,325
You can't stand for another man
to be touching me.

1730
02:29:55,647 --> 02:29:57,444
So you want me, Tony?

1731
02:30:01,047 --> 02:30:02,480
What are you talking?

1732
02:30:04,047 --> 02:30:05,446
Is that it?

1733
02:30:09,167 --> 02:30:10,486
Here I am, Tony.

1734
02:30:15,247 --> 02:30:17,363
I am all yours now, Tony, you see?

1735
02:30:20,047 --> 02:30:21,605
I'm all yours now.

1736
02:30:24,207 --> 02:30:26,357
You better come and get me now.

1737
02:30:27,247 --> 02:30:29,078
- All right. Come on.
- Come and get me.

1738
02:30:29,167 --> 02:30:30,566
Come and get me.

1739
02:30:31,527 --> 02:30:34,200
You do it now before it's too late.

1740
02:30:36,767 --> 02:30:37,916
Come on, Tony.

1741
02:30:40,007 --> 02:30:41,122
Fuck me.

1742
02:30:45,007 --> 02:30:47,316
Fuck me. Come on and just fuck me!

1743
02:31:03,527 --> 02:31:04,516
Die!

1744
02:31:18,087 --> 02:31:20,681
They're all over the place!
Get out of here!

1745
02:31:43,127 --> 02:31:47,120
Come on. Look at your face.
It's all dirty.

1746
02:32:03,967 --> 02:32:05,480
Please talk to me.

1747
02:32:07,247 --> 02:32:08,726
Don't be mad at me.

1748
02:32:08,967 --> 02:32:12,164
Please. Gina. Come on.

1749
02:32:13,887 --> 02:32:17,402
I love Manny, you know?

1750
02:32:17,727 --> 02:32:18,921
I love him.

1751
02:32:20,887 --> 02:32:23,276
And I love you, too, you know?

1752
02:32:48,927 --> 02:32:50,155
Gimme a smile.

1753
02:32:50,247 --> 02:32:54,365
They're coming from everywhere!
Tony, open up! Open the fucking door!

1754
02:32:55,927 --> 02:32:57,838
Please! Tony!

1755
02:32:57,927 --> 02:32:59,838
Let me in, Boss! Please!

1756
02:33:00,047 --> 02:33:02,003
Tony, open the fucking door!

1757
02:33:23,007 --> 02:33:27,922
You wait here, okay?
I'll be with you. I'll be back.

1758
02:33:31,647 --> 02:33:33,524
You wait for me. I'm coming back.

1759
02:33:37,247 --> 02:33:39,556
Okay, Sosa. You want to fuck with me?

1760
02:33:43,087 --> 02:33:45,237
You're fucking with the best!

1761
02:33:50,127 --> 02:33:51,765
You want to fuck with me?

1762
02:33:53,487 --> 02:33:54,806
You cockroaches.

1763
02:33:58,407 --> 02:34:01,046
You want to play games?
Okay, I play with you.

1764
02:34:05,647 --> 02:34:07,205
You wanna play rough?

1765
02:34:08,647 --> 02:34:10,717
Say hello to my little friend!

1766
02:34:13,927 --> 02:34:15,440
You want to play rough?

1767
02:34:16,567 --> 02:34:19,286
There! You like that?

1768
02:34:21,087 --> 02:34:22,315
You want more?

1769
02:34:29,127 --> 02:34:30,276
You whores!

1770
02:34:31,647 --> 02:34:32,716
Cowards!

1771
02:35:18,407 --> 02:35:19,840
Want to fuck with me?

1772
02:35:36,007 --> 02:35:37,679
Go ahead!

1773
02:35:39,087 --> 02:35:40,076
Die!

1774
02:35:42,687 --> 02:35:44,757
How'd you like that?

1775
02:35:45,527 --> 02:35:47,404
You fucking maricon!

1776
02:35:49,727 --> 02:35:51,365
You think you can take me?

1777
02:35:51,447 --> 02:35:53,597
You need a fucking army,
if you gonna take me!

1778
02:35:53,687 --> 02:35:57,839
You hear? Come on!
I take you all to fucking hell!

1779
02:36:03,447 --> 02:36:06,519
Who you think you fucking with?
I'm Tony Montana!

1780
02:36:07,407 --> 02:36:09,875
You fuck with me,
you fucking with the best!

1781
02:36:13,927 --> 02:36:15,440
I'm still standing.

1782
02:36:19,567 --> 02:36:21,956
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!

1783
02:36:23,487 --> 02:36:25,318
Come on! I take your fucking bullet!

1784
02:36:25,407 --> 02:36:29,446
You think you kill me with bullets?
I take your fucking bullets! Go ahead!
