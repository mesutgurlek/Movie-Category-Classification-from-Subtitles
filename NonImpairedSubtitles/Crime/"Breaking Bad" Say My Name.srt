Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:04,791
The methylamine...
Jesse and I will be

3
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:06,731
taking our two thirds
and we're selling it.

4
00:00:06,892 --> 00:00:09,449
Full thousand gallons,
not a drop less.

5
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:12,350
Mike's connection won't buy
unless he gets your share too.

6
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:13,631
Absolutely not.

7
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:16,817
This deal's going down,
but for some reason,

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,442
I don't trust you alone
with the methylamine.

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,194
I'm gonna have to restrain you.

10
00:00:23,738 --> 00:00:27,162
You get your five millions, we
both do, and he gets his methylamine!

11
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:28,468
Is that true, Walter?

12
00:00:28,574 --> 00:00:29,925
Everybody wins.

13
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:54,841
[Jesse] There.

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,011
That's them.

15
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:12,108
[Sighs] Your play, Walter.

16
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:14,143
You're on your own.

17
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:31,394
Looks like you're about 1,000
gallons light here, Mike.

18
00:01:31,428 --> 00:01:33,396
Where's the juice?

19
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,732
The methylamine isn't coming.

20
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:40,203
Why is that?

21
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:42,171
And who the hell are you?

22
00:01:42,206 --> 00:01:43,673
I'm the man who's keeping it.

23
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:46,509
What the hell's this?

24
00:01:46,527 --> 00:01:49,195
We had an agreement, right?
We got our deal.

25
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,181
So where's the tank, Mike?
Mike doesn't know where it is.

26
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:55,652
Only I do. And you're dealing
with me now, not him.

27
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:57,853
Why don't you just cut
to what it is you want,

28
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:00,022
or what you think is gonna
happen here, all right?

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,825
'Cause we're gonna get
what we came for.

30
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:06,195
That 1,000 gallons of methylamine
is worth more in my hands

31
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:08,881
than it is in yours or anyone
else's, for that matter.

32
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,884
But I need distribution.

33
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,387
[Chuckles] Distribution.

34
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:16,372
That's right.

35
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,875
So if you agree
to give up your cook

36
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:22,729
and sell my product instead,

37
00:02:22,763 --> 00:02:25,214
I'll give you 35 percent
of the take.

38
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:28,884
35 percent?
Wow. Are you kidding me?

39
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:32,221
35-- Mike, please tell
me this is a joke.

40
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,608
You know how far we had to stick our
necks out to get our hands on this cash?

41
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,393
And why the hell
would we want you?

42
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:39,412
You realize we have
our own operation, right?

43
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:42,081
I know all about
your operation.

44
00:02:42,116 --> 00:02:45,501
My partners here tell me
that you produce a meth

45
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:48,955
that's 70% pure,
if you're lucky.

46
00:02:49,006 --> 00:02:53,209
What I produce
is 99.1% pure.

47
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:54,744
So?

48
00:02:57,715 --> 00:03:01,934
So... it's grade school T-Ball

49
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:04,604
versus the New York Yankees.

50
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:08,307
Yours is, uh, just some tepid,

51
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:11,594
off-brand,
generic cola.

52
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:15,598
What I'm making
is classic Coke.

53
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:18,367
All right. Okay.

54
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:20,319
So, um, [Clears throat]

55
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,622
if we just waste you
right here,

56
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:24,791
right now,
and leave you in the desert,

57
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:27,376
then there is no more Coke
on the market, right?

58
00:03:27,411 --> 00:03:30,129
See how that works?
There's only us.

59
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:34,116
Do you really wanna live
in a world without Coca Cola?

60
00:03:44,595 --> 00:03:47,730
My partner tells me
that your crew

61
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:50,650
switched to a P2P cook
because of our success.

62
00:03:50,684 --> 00:03:53,019
You dye your meth
with food coloring

63
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,687
to make it look like mine.

64
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:59,158
You already ape my product
at every turn.

65
00:03:59,193 --> 00:04:00,943
But now...

66
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:03,362
you have the opportunity
to sell it yourself.

67
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:05,414
I need you to listen to me.

68
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,416
We're not gonna
give up this deal

69
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,536
to be your errand boys,
do you understand?

70
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:12,538
For what?

71
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:14,874
To watch a bunch of junkies
get a better high?

72
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:18,594
A better high
means customers pay more.

73
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,016
A higher purity
means a greater yield.

74
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:27,336
That's 130 million dollars
a profit

75
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:31,357
that isn't being pissed away
by some substandard cook.

76
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,227
Now you listen to me.

77
00:04:34,278 --> 00:04:36,512
You've got the greatest
meth cook in a--

78
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,564
No, the two

79
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:41,150
greatest meth cooks
in America right here,

80
00:04:41,184 --> 00:04:43,736
and with our skills,

81
00:04:43,787 --> 00:04:46,289
you'll earn more from that 35%

82
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:48,357
than you ever would
on your own.

83
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,526
Yeah. So you say.

84
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:52,695
Just wondering why
we're so lucky.

85
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:54,630
Why cut us in?

86
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:57,583
Mike is retiring from our crew,

87
00:04:57,634 --> 00:05:00,303
so his share of the partnership
is available,

88
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:03,472
if you can handle his end--

89
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:05,675
distribution.

90
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:07,894
And if you give him
five million dollars

91
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:09,896
of the 15 million
that you brought today.

92
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,081
Just think of it
as a finder's fee

93
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:14,317
for bringing us together.

94
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:17,954
We have 40 pounds of product
ready to ship,

95
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:19,689
ready to go.

96

You all know exactly who I am.

who the hell you are.

Yeah, you do.
I'm the cook.

I'm the man
who killed Gus Fring.

106

Bullshit.

That's right.

Jesse, just give me
some time here, okay?

125

I'll need a little help getting things
up and running during this transition.

You can at least
do that for me, right?

00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:55,273
Huh? Come on.
Don't worry.

First, as I said,

134
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:38,399
I'll handle the legacy costs
out of my end

so you won't have to worry
about my guys anymore.

Second, the bug.

137
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:45,990
The DEA will do a sweep.
Can't say when. Could be anytime.

138
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,192
But you need
to get it outta there,

sooner rather than later.

140

323
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:21,127
Look...

324
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:23,662
Look, I know how upset you are

325
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,331
about what happened
to this boy.

326
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,352
I am just as upset as you are.

327
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:32,722
Are you? Really?

328
00:21:34,474 --> 00:21:37,509
How can you say that
to me? Jesus!

329
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:40,146
I mean, I'm the one
who's the father here.

330
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,482
What, do I have to curl up in a
ball in tears in front of you?

331
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:45,517
Do I have to lock myself
away in a room

332
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:47,519
and get high
to prove it to you?

333
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:50,072
What happened to that boy
is a tragedy,

334
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:52,524
and it tears me up inside!

335
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:54,526
But because it happened, what,

336
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:56,528
am I supposed to just lie down

337
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:58,530
and die with him?

338
00:21:58,548 --> 00:22:00,082
It's done!

339
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:02,084
It makes me sick
that it happened,

340
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:05,037
just like everyone else
who has died in our wake.

341
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:06,972
What Todd did--

342
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:10,709
You and I have done things
that are just as bad.

343
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:12,044
Yeah.

344
00:22:12,062 --> 00:22:14,046
All the people
that we've killed--

345
00:22:14,064 --> 00:22:17,266
Gale and the rest...

346
00:22:17,317 --> 00:22:19,268
If you believe
that there's a hell--

347
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:22,271
I don't know if you're into that.
But we're...

348
00:22:22,322 --> 00:22:24,723
We're already pretty much
going there, right?

349
00:22:24,741 --> 00:22:28,244
But I'm not gonna lie down
until I get there.

350
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:32,748
What, just because I don't wanna
cook meth anymore, I'm lying down?

351
00:22:32,783 --> 00:22:35,400
How many more people
are gonna die 'cause of us?

352
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:37,569
No one. None.

353
00:22:37,587 --> 00:22:40,289
Now that we're in control,
no one else gets hurt.

354
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,210
You keep saying that,
and it's bullshit every time!

355
00:22:44,244 --> 00:22:46,712
- No.
- Always! You know what?

356
00:22:46,746 --> 00:22:49,632
I'm done, okay?

357
00:22:49,683 --> 00:22:51,634
You just give me my money,

358
00:22:51,685 --> 00:22:54,136
and you and I--

359
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:56,439
we're done.

360
00:22:58,892 --> 00:23:02,228
Hmm. Okay.

361
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,730
Why?

362
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,401
Why do you want this money?

363
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,290
Because it's mine.
It's my cut.

364
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:17,042
But isn't it filthy
blood money?

365
00:23:17,077 --> 00:23:20,496
I mean, you're so pure.
You have such emotional depth.

366
00:23:20,547 --> 00:23:23,299
No, no, no, no.
You shouldn't touch that dirty money.

367
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,918
I'll save you from that, Jesse.

368
00:23:26,953 --> 00:23:28,587
Come on.

369
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:30,256
You want it.

370
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,842
You want it just as much
as I want it.

371
00:23:32,893 --> 00:23:35,845
And it's not wrong to want it.

372
00:23:35,896 --> 00:23:37,346
Okay?

373
00:23:37,397 --> 00:23:41,233
So stay and work with me,

374
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:44,469
and you can make ten ti--
20 times as much.

375
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:51,744
Whatever, man.

376
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:55,197
You don't wanna pay me,
I don't care.

377
00:23:55,282 --> 00:23:56,699
Yes, you do.

378
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,251
It's on you, all right?

379
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:02,204
- I'm done.
- No, you're not.

380
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:04,673
You're not done.
You're not leaving,

381
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,209
because if you leave,
you get nothing!

382
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,796
Do you understand me?
Nothing!

383
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,299
Jesse!

384
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:20,553
<i>Budget for the current fiscal
year for electronic surveillance</i>

385
00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:21,854

386
00:24:21,888 --> 00:24:24,490
<i>on par with ATF</i>
<i>and the Marshal Service,</i>

387
00:24:24,524 --> 00:24:26,959
<i>but still just a fraction</i>
<i>of FBI totals.</i>

388
00:24:26,993 --> 00:24:30,045
<i>We're lobbying congress</i>
<i>for an additional 1.41,</i>

389
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:32,181

390

393
00:24:39,556 --> 00:24:42,224
<i>if you refer to the chart</i>
<i>in appendix four.</i>

394
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:45,344

395
00:24:45,362 --> 00:24:47,813
<i>Hank?</i>

396
00:24:47,847 --> 00:24:49,565
<i>Hank?</i>

397
00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:51,367
<i>Hank!</i>

398
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:55,237
<i>I think we're going</i>

401
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,410
<i>Thank you, everybody.</i>

402
00:25:14,341 --> 00:25:16,225
<i>You know no one wants</i>

403
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:18,394
<i>to see you succeed at this</i>
<i>more than me, right?</i>

404
00:25:18,428 --> 00:25:21,096
- Yes, sir.
<i>- I know how good you are.</i>

405
00:25:21,147 --> 00:25:24,233
<i>I wouldn't have stuck my neck out
to get you here if I didn't.</i>

406
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:26,602
<i>But you're not knocking</i>
<i>down doors anymore, Bubba.</i>

407
00:25:26,653 --> 00:25:28,771
<i>You're in charge</i>

408
00:25:28,822 --> 00:25:30,990
<i>and that comes</i>
<i>with responsibilities.</i>

409
00:25:31,024 --> 00:25:33,192
<i>I mean, Hank, basic reports</i>

410
00:25:33,226 --> 00:25:35,494
<i>aren't being filed</i>
<i>in a timely manner.</i>

411
00:25:35,528 --> 00:25:37,413
I'll work on it.
It'll get better.

412
00:25:37,447 --> 00:25:39,832
<i>Yeah, it will, because way
too much time and money</i>

413
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:41,533
<i>is being spent</i>
<i>on the Fring case,</i>

414
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:43,202
<i>a case which is</i>
<i>essentially over.</i>

415
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:45,087
<i>All this overtime</i>

416
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:47,373
<i>to surveil Michael Ehrmantraut?</i>

417
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:49,408
<i>That's just money that could</i>
<i>be better spent elsewhere.</i>

418
00:25:49,426 --> 00:25:51,093
I understand,

419
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:52,911
but I'm not making
these choices lightly.

420
00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:55,414
We've got increased reports
of blue meth on the street,

421
00:25:55,432 --> 00:25:58,250
Fring's gang is still operational,
and Ehrmantraut is involved.

422
00:25:58,268 --> 00:25:59,584
It's that simple.

423
00:25:59,603 --> 00:26:01,586
<i>I believe you.</i>
<i>But so what?</i>

424
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:03,588
<i>It's one case out of dozens,</i>

425
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:06,558
<i>and you don't play favorites with it
just because it used to be yours.</i>

426
00:26:06,592 --> 00:26:08,560
- I really think that--
<i>- Don't play favorites with it, Hank.</i>

427
00:26:08,594 --> 00:26:10,429
<i>You got a bigger job than that.</i>

428
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:12,431
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>forget the financial cost.</i>

429
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:14,933
<i>I hear you're personally serving
search warrants out in the field?</i>

430
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:17,236
That was an error in judgment.

431
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,288
- Won't happen again.
<i>- You're damn right it won't.</i>

432
00:26:19,322 --> 00:26:21,290
<i>I'm just gonna bottom line</i>
<i>this for you.</i>

433
00:26:21,324 --> 00:26:24,326
<i>The surveillance budget</i>
<i>for Ehrmantraut is now zero.</i>

434
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:26,412
<i>We clear?</i>

435
00:26:26,446 --> 00:26:29,298
Sure. Thank you.

436
00:26:29,332 --> 00:26:31,350
- Clear.
<i>- Good.</i>

437
00:26:31,384 --> 00:26:33,385
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

438
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:45,514
[Knocking] Yeah?

439
00:26:46,966 --> 00:26:48,633
Hey.

440
00:26:54,474 --> 00:26:57,242
So, Ramey wanted
to catch up with you?

441
00:26:57,277 --> 00:26:59,161
Talk sports and stuff, I guess?

442
00:26:59,195 --> 00:27:01,113
Yeah.
Something like that.

443
00:27:01,147 --> 00:27:04,033
No more following Ehrmantraut.

444
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:07,619
Not worth
the financial investment.

445
00:27:07,653 --> 00:27:09,838
Well, it's not like
the guy's going anywhere.

446
00:27:09,873 --> 00:27:12,324
He's not even bothering
to throw our tails anymore.

447
00:27:12,342 --> 00:27:14,343
He's just living
a boring old-man life

448
00:27:14,377 --> 00:27:16,929
like he has nothing left
to hide.

449
00:27:16,963 --> 00:27:18,964
And none of Fring's crew
is talking?

450
00:27:18,998 --> 00:27:20,632
Not giving an inch.

451
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,718
You sweeten the pot enough?

452
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:26,021
Zero jail time and an
all-expense-paid trip to Maui?

453
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:28,173
[Chuckles] Not that, but close.

454
00:27:28,191 --> 00:27:29,841
Nobody wants to bite.

455
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:31,176
Christ!

456
00:27:31,194 --> 00:27:33,278
They're either the most
loyal crew in history,

457
00:27:33,313 --> 00:27:34,947
or someone's
still paying them off.

458
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:36,281
You still checking
bank records?

459
00:27:36,316 --> 00:27:37,700
No one living
beyond their means.

460
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:39,651
Nine perps...

461
00:27:39,685 --> 00:27:41,904
All being represented
by one lawyer.

462
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:44,189
Not unusual
in a case like this.

463
00:27:44,207 --> 00:27:46,191
Yeah, this guy--
What's his name?

464
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:49,078
Daniel Wachsberger?

465
00:27:49,129 --> 00:27:52,214
He represents every one
of these douchebags

466
00:27:52,248 --> 00:27:54,533
except for Ehrmantraut.

467
00:27:54,551 --> 00:27:56,868
Can we find out
more about the lawyer?

468
00:27:56,886 --> 00:27:59,138
You want me to start
tailing a lawyer?

469
00:27:59,172 --> 00:28:01,724
Like the shit ain't deep
enough for you already?

470
00:28:01,758 --> 00:28:03,726
Hey, Ramey said we couldn't
follow Ehrmantraut.

471
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,228
He didn't say anything
about anybody else.

472
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,713
Do it.

473
00:28:08,732 --> 00:28:11,233
You're the boss.

474
00:28:14,237 --> 00:28:15,571
[Door closes]

475
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:20,392
[Sighs]

476
00:28:31,204 --> 00:28:32,871
[Sighs]

477
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:40,129
All right.
Shall we get started?

Okay.
That's all right.

Listen and apply yourself.

492

If you do that,
then we just might have

493

00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,504
I need you to pick up that bag

638
00:40:09,522 --> 00:40:11,640
and get it to me
as soon as possible.

639
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:14,476
Do you know how thick the crap storm
is out there because of this?

640
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,645
I told you not to use that lawyer.
He's a hack!

641
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:19,281
- Shut up, Saul, and get the bag.
<i>[Jesse] - Hey, Mike,</i>

642
00:40:19,315 --> 00:40:20,816
I can get it to you, all right?

643
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,685
- Just tell me what to do.
<i>- No, kid. Not you.</i>

644
00:40:23,703 --> 00:40:26,955
I'm paying Saul.
He can do the job just fine.

645
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:29,658
Yeah, you're paying me,
and the DEA knows I represent you,

646
00:40:29,692 --> 00:40:31,660
so they're probably
sitting on my car right now,

647
00:40:31,694 --> 00:40:33,712
hoping I do something stupid.

648
00:40:33,746 --> 00:40:35,864
Mike, I can do it, okay?
It's not a problem.

649
00:40:35,882 --> 00:40:36,882
No, Jesse.

650
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:38,216
Jesus, I'll do it.

651
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:40,836
Besides, you're out, remember?

652
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,871
Mike, tell me where
to get this bag.

653

656
00:41:56,612 --> 00:41:58,847
Hello, Walter.

657
00:42:00,516 --> 00:42:02,751
Before I hand this over,

658
00:42:02,785 --> 00:42:04,286
I need something from you.

659
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,687
And what's that?

660
00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:07,923
The names of your nine men.

661
00:42:07,957 --> 00:42:10,725
[Scoffs] Why?

662
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,261
You're never gonna pay them off.
What's the point?

663
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:16,514
The point is, Mike,
it affects me.

664
00:42:16,565 --> 00:42:20,101
It affects Jesse, too,
and we deserve to know.

665
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:23,104
The only thing left
to do now is leave town.

666
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:24,606
You understand?

667
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,808
"Leave town." Wow.

668
00:42:26,842 --> 00:42:30,645
Yeah, I just can't up and
leave, like you, Mike.

669
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,148
I've got a family.
I've got people who depend on me.

670
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:36,117
Yeah.

671
00:42:51,267 --> 00:42:53,601
Good-bye, Walter.

672
00:42:55,671 --> 00:42:58,373
You're welcome!

673
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:02,143
[Scoffs]

674
00:43:02,178 --> 00:43:04,145
I'm sorry, what?

675
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,698
I want those names, Mike.
You owe me that much.

676
00:43:06,732 --> 00:43:08,700
I don't owe you a damn thing.

677
00:43:08,734 --> 00:43:12,520
All of this, falling apart
like this, is on you.

678
00:43:12,538 --> 00:43:14,022
Wow.

679
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,957
[Laughs] Wow!

680
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:19,044
Oh, that's some kind of logic
right there, Mike.

681
00:43:19,078 --> 00:43:22,247
You screw up, get yourself
followed by the DEA,

682
00:43:22,298 --> 00:43:24,582
and now, suddenly,
this is all my fault?

683
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:26,251
Why don't you walk me
through this, Mike?

684
00:43:26,302 --> 00:43:29,304
We had a good thing,
you stupid son of a bitch!

685
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:31,756
We had Fring.
We had a lab.

686
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:34,676
We had everything we needed,
and it all ran like clockwork.

687
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,678
- Oh, my God.
- You could've shut your mouth,

688
00:43:36,712 --> 00:43:39,931
cooked, and made as much
money as you ever needed.

689
00:43:39,982 --> 00:43:43,551
It was perfect.
But, no, you just had to blow it up.

690
00:43:43,569 --> 00:43:46,220
You and your pride
and your ego!

691
00:43:46,238 --> 00:43:48,523
You just had to be the man.

692
00:43:48,557 --> 00:43:51,192
If you'd done your job,
known your place,

693
00:43:51,226 --> 00:43:53,411
we'd all be fine right now!

I just realized
that Lydia has the names.

700
00:46:12,168 --> 00:46:14,419
I can get them from her.

701
00:46:19,091 --> 00:46:21,142
I'm sorry, Mike.

702
00:46:22,678 --> 00:46:26,014
This-- this whole thing
could've been avoided--

703
