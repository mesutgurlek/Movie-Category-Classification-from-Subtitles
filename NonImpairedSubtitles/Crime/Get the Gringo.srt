1
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:28,323
. . .gringo border patrols
in pursuit

2
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,109
Load these guys in our car

3
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:29,486
The bags too

4
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:31,029
And put this shit out!

5
00:05:48,524 --> 00:05:50,316
Luis, let's get
the fuck out of here!

6
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:51,651
It's procedure!

7
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:53,736
Fuck procedure, let's go!

8
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,878
No IDs

9
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:28,938
This guy's dead !

10
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:28,081
Check your guns,
you know the rules

11
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,892
Give me your shoes, bitch !

12
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,692
You'll have fun
in here asshole

13
00:09:22,488 --> 00:09:24,072
This will be
your home for a while

14
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:26,407
and we your family

15
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:28,659
In a few hours

16
00:09:28,744 --> 00:09:31,662
you will be moved
into the main prison

17
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:34,916
You'll have some freedom

18
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:38,127
but remember. . .

19
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:40,338
this is still a prison

20
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,841
Use what you've learned
in this holding cell

21
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:46,677
and don't make trouble

22
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:49,013
for us or yourselves

23
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:51,099
Or, as the saying goes. . .

24
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:53,226
small town. . .

25
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,644
large hell

26
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:57,021
Welcome

27
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:00,608
This is "El Pueblito"

28
00:10:04,363 --> 00:10:05,363
God bless you

29
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:07,605
Get up you lazy bums!

30
00:14:10,442 --> 00:14:11,442
Move it, move it!

31
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:14,987
You can talk later,
let's move it!

32
00:14:16,782 --> 00:14:17,782
Move it!

33
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:24,705
You too gringo,
get the fuck over there!

34
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:27,833
Let's go, let's go

35
00:15:10,752 --> 00:15:12,670
Heads up gringo,
here they come!

36
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:51,917
Lunch !

37
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:24,022
I just lit it for him !

38
00:20:24,107 --> 00:20:25,107
Let's go

39
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,863
What did I tell you about
the fucking cigarettes!

40
00:22:58,970 --> 00:22:59,970
Nothing's free!

41
00:23:00,054 --> 00:23:02,222
Please! We have
nowhere to go!

42
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:04,808
You could stay with me

43
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,269
You won't let me help you

44
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,980
C'mon kids,
hurry up, let's go

45
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,170
Get out, cabrón !

46
00:24:38,152 --> 00:24:39,444
All good General?

47
00:24:40,571 --> 00:24:41,822
Take care of him

48
00:26:22,256 --> 00:26:23,423
Why aren't you in bed?

49
00:26:23,508 --> 00:26:25,133
I didn't want you
walking home alone

50
00:26:58,918 --> 00:26:59,960
King Rat

51
00:29:47,044 --> 00:29:48,295
30 pesos for fifteen minutes

52
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:49,629
Go play kids!

53
00:30:11,652 --> 00:30:14,321
Calm down,
there's enough for everyone

54
00:30:32,715 --> 00:30:34,090
That's the kid,
give him a hand !

55
00:30:37,762 --> 00:30:39,095
What's wrong with you?

56
00:30:39,513 --> 00:30:40,722
Tough guy, eh?

57
00:30:41,098 --> 00:30:42,515
Shut the fuck up!

58
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:45,226
Touch him again
and I'll cut your balls off

59
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:46,269
Now fuck off!

60
00:34:44,341 --> 00:34:45,341
What do you mean why?

61
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:46,968
He's stealing from us,
and he's an idiot

62
00:34:47,636 --> 00:34:48,845
Carnal is family

63
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:50,221
He's a liability

64
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:53,099
You straighten him out,
I don't want to deal with it

65
00:34:53,517 --> 00:34:55,059
You may not have a choice

66
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:56,311
He's getting out of hand

67
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,937
People hate him

68
00:34:58,939 --> 00:35:00,023
What do you
want me to do. . .

69
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:01,858
kill him?

70
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,193
Just get him off real estate

71
00:35:04,278 --> 00:35:06,112
It's a big job,
too much money

72
00:35:06,196 --> 00:35:07,530
Give him an assistant

73
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:19,834
Mom !

74
00:35:19,877 --> 00:35:20,960
A sight for sore eyes

75
00:35:21,045 --> 00:35:22,253
Aunt Flor

76
00:35:22,796 --> 00:35:24,047
And your cousin?

77
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:25,214
He's coming

78
00:35:30,512 --> 00:35:31,638
How's his health?

79
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:33,514
Is he drinking?

80
00:35:33,557 --> 00:35:34,557
Don't worry so much

81
00:35:34,642 --> 00:35:35,642
I'm holding you responsible

82
00:36:36,412 --> 00:36:38,121
Let me remind you. . .

83
00:36:38,414 --> 00:36:40,289
that all the money raised. . .

84
00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:43,167
will go to the family fund
here at El Pueblito

85
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:44,711
So cough it up!

86
00:36:45,796 --> 00:36:47,839
Straight from Juarez. . .

87
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:50,091
the King of the Skies. . .

88
00:38:25,229 --> 00:38:26,312
You got a visitor!

89
00:41:24,574 --> 00:41:25,741
That's my watch

90
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:26,993
Hey kid !

91
00:41:27,077 --> 00:41:28,536
Where are you going?

92
00:41:28,578 --> 00:41:29,578
Come here you prick

93
00:41:29,663 --> 00:41:30,663
What?

94
00:41:30,747 --> 00:41:31,747
Come here you little fucker

95
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,082
Fucking Indian

96
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:34,125
Damn !

97
00:41:45,595 --> 00:41:46,679
Hey, cabrón !

98
00:41:58,775 --> 00:41:59,817
Give me!

99
00:41:59,901 --> 00:42:00,901
Where'd you get it?

100
00:42:00,944 --> 00:42:02,028
I found it in the trash

101
00:42:02,612 --> 00:42:03,612
It's mine

102
00:42:04,197 --> 00:42:05,406
I'm going to tell Caracas

103
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:07,241
What are you looking at?

104
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:45,000
What's up?

105
00:45:47,796 --> 00:45:48,963
What do you want?

106
00:45:49,005 --> 00:45:50,005
The money

107
00:45:50,674 --> 00:45:53,008
You trade rent
payments for sex

108
00:45:53,426 --> 00:45:54,885
Others pay you with drugs

109
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:56,011
You're out of control

110
00:45:56,096 --> 00:45:57,721
You're a disgrace

111
00:45:58,306 --> 00:46:00,432
We never should have
given you this job

112
00:46:00,517 --> 00:46:02,309
Tough shit. . .
it's a family business

113
00:46:02,352 --> 00:46:03,978
Maybe you're the fuck up

114
00:46:04,354 --> 00:46:06,814
If I was in charge,
no one would steal from us

115
00:46:08,233 --> 00:46:09,358
Enlighten me

116
00:46:09,651 --> 00:46:11,026
I was robbed

117
00:46:11,444 --> 00:46:12,444
By whom?

118
00:46:16,408 --> 00:46:17,408
I don't know

119
00:46:18,576 --> 00:46:20,369
There are
a few thieves in here

120
00:46:21,705 --> 00:46:23,580
You and your fucking lies

121
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:26,000
Don't bullshit me

122
00:46:26,876 --> 00:46:29,336
The money, or the fucker
who robbed you

123
00:46:30,547 --> 00:46:31,588
You're my cousin. . .

124
00:46:32,549 --> 00:46:34,675
but if you don't deliver,
you're finished

125
00:46:37,512 --> 00:46:38,804
Fuck off,
I'm not your bitch !

126
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:41,140
The money, fucker

127
00:46:54,738 --> 00:46:56,155
When did you get robbed?

128
00:46:56,573 --> 00:46:57,573
Who knows

129
00:46:58,908 --> 00:47:00,075
When I got my watch back?

130
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,201
I don't know!

131
00:47:08,335 --> 00:47:09,335
Maybe

132
00:47:19,846 --> 00:47:20,929
Do you think I'm an idiot!?

133
00:47:27,103 --> 00:47:28,437
Where'd you get the watch !?

134
00:47:28,521 --> 00:47:29,605
I found it!

135
00:47:31,232 --> 00:47:32,316
Did the gringo help?

136
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,484
No, it was just me!

137
00:47:33,568 --> 00:47:34,568
Get him !

138
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:38,322
Caracas.

139
00:47:39,282 --> 00:47:41,116
Think you can fool me
you little fuck!?

140
00:48:39,968 --> 00:48:41,427
Get off her,
you son of a bitch !

141
00:48:52,522 --> 00:48:53,981
I'm not done with you !

142
00:49:13,835 --> 00:49:15,461
What did you idiots do!?

143
00:49:16,546 --> 00:49:19,214
This room was built for me!

144
00:49:19,507 --> 00:49:21,091
Now you're bleeding
all over it

145
00:49:21,176 --> 00:49:22,468
He had the mom. . .

146
00:49:23,803 --> 00:49:25,053
He was going to kill the kid

147
00:49:25,972 --> 00:49:27,556
Son of a bitch !

148
00:49:28,892 --> 00:49:29,933
What the fuck did you do?

149
00:49:30,894 --> 00:49:32,144
Idiot!

150
00:49:32,228 --> 00:49:33,228
Answer me!

151
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:34,688
Now what?

152
00:49:34,731 --> 00:49:35,731
Javi !

153
00:49:43,907 --> 00:49:45,032
It's Aunt Flor

154
00:49:45,492 --> 00:49:46,783
Answer it

155
00:49:48,578 --> 00:49:49,786
Answer it, man !

156
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:53,290
Hi, Aunt

157
00:49:55,376 --> 00:49:57,252
He can't talk right now. . .

158
00:49:59,422 --> 00:50:00,506
he's lying down

159
00:50:04,427 --> 00:50:05,427
Okay, bye

160
00:50:07,013 --> 00:50:08,013
It's going to
break her heart

161
00:50:08,097 --> 00:50:09,097
What could I say?

162
00:50:10,016 --> 00:50:12,142
If the gringo hadn't
killed him, I would have

163
00:50:12,644 --> 00:50:13,810
What about the gringo?

164
00:50:14,062 --> 00:50:15,229
What about him?

165
00:50:15,605 --> 00:50:16,980
He's not family,
he's not Mexican. . .

166
00:50:18,566 --> 00:50:19,691
I'd kill him

167
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:35,165
Fucking gringo!

168
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,333
One of those was my cousin !

169
00:50:51,641 --> 00:50:52,766
I need a drink

170
00:50:57,897 --> 00:50:58,897
Cut him loose!

171
00:51:07,657 --> 00:51:08,699
He knows about my liver

172
00:51:10,076 --> 00:51:12,119
He knew about
our problems with Carnal

173
00:51:13,329 --> 00:51:15,622
He seems to know
what I'm thinking

174
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:18,542
Who is he?

175
00:51:18,626 --> 00:51:19,626
I don't know

176
00:51:20,003 --> 00:51:21,086
Armando doesn't know either

177
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:24,798
So he's in here with no name,
charges, or fingerprints?

178
00:51:25,842 --> 00:51:27,759
You're in charge
of security!

179
00:51:27,844 --> 00:51:30,053
How does this fucking gringo
know everything?

180
00:51:30,138 --> 00:51:31,138
So kill him then

181
00:51:31,222 --> 00:51:32,222
You idiot!

182
00:51:33,683 --> 00:51:35,642
Don't be hasty!

183
00:51:36,603 --> 00:51:38,186
First, find out who sent him

184
00:51:38,646 --> 00:51:39,855
Find out who he is

185
00:51:41,274 --> 00:51:42,524
Then we kill him

186
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:51,450
Number three

187
00:53:51,195 --> 00:53:52,446
Get Vazquez and Romero

188
00:53:54,824 --> 00:53:57,033
And bring the money too

189
00:56:17,592 --> 00:56:18,967
That's Javi's share!

190
00:56:20,094 --> 00:56:21,177
I was going to
give Javi his cut!

191
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:46,912
Leave them there

192
00:56:51,334 --> 00:56:53,168
I told you the gringo
would be trouble

193
00:56:53,586 --> 00:56:56,463
He stole big time
from Frank in San Diego

194
00:56:57,006 --> 00:56:59,215
Frank knows we have his money

195
00:57:04,263 --> 00:57:05,513
You need to slow down

196
00:57:07,767 --> 00:57:09,100
My big brother. . .

197
00:57:10,603 --> 00:57:12,520
always worried about me

198
00:57:12,897 --> 00:57:14,522
You keep drinking
and smoking like this. . .

199
00:57:14,565 --> 00:57:16,399
and the kid's liver
may not be enough

200
00:57:18,486 --> 00:57:20,028
Go get the gringo

201
00:57:51,477 --> 00:57:52,477
There's three of them

202
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:55,063
Will the watchtower
be covered?

203
00:57:56,148 --> 00:57:57,607
Have we ever failed you?

204
00:58:02,989 --> 00:58:04,531
Three guys
are coming for the gringo

205
00:58:04,573 --> 00:58:05,573
Cover them

206
00:58:05,658 --> 00:58:06,658
They'll be easy to spot

207
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:28,109
Fucking gringos!

208
01:01:28,402 --> 01:01:29,402
Idiots!

209
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,345
Just kill him already

210
01:01:56,847 --> 01:01:58,181
That's not a good idea

211
01:01:59,308 --> 01:02:01,643
There are two reasons
not to kill me

212
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:03,937
You never mentioned
you speak Spanish

213
01:02:05,064 --> 01:02:06,314
Nobody asked me

214
01:02:07,983 --> 01:02:09,067
I need practice

215
01:02:11,237 --> 01:02:14,697
Frank is now
a big problem for you

216
01:02:15,658 --> 01:02:17,242
And what's
the second reason?

217
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,327
I can get to him

218
01:02:20,829 --> 01:02:22,163
I did it once already

219
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:26,084
Don't do me any favors

220
01:02:26,502 --> 01:02:27,835
It's in your best
interest as well

221
01:02:28,837 --> 01:02:30,088
This is too much, Javi

222
01:02:30,756 --> 01:02:32,674
A shootout!
Inside the prison

223
01:02:33,175 --> 01:02:34,175
If you get me out of here. . .

224
01:02:34,802 --> 01:02:36,010
I'll kill Frank

225
01:02:36,595 --> 01:02:37,679
I'm not joking !

226
01:02:38,305 --> 01:02:39,681
This bloodbath
will have consequences

227
01:02:40,849 --> 01:02:41,849
Armando. . .

228
01:02:42,476 --> 01:02:45,395
You chose sides
a long time ago

229
01:02:45,688 --> 01:02:48,189
We can change that
if you want

230
01:02:48,399 --> 01:02:49,524
No problem

231
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:52,360
But why don't you clean up
the mess out there instead

232
01:02:53,612 --> 01:02:55,113
Get the fuck out!

233
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:58,950
Okay

234
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:00,910
Go kill him

235
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:03,079
But don't come back

236
01:03:03,956 --> 01:03:06,666
The money you stole
is the price for your life

237
01:03:10,212 --> 01:03:12,630
I'll need a little cash. . .

238
01:03:13,007 --> 01:03:14,215
guns. . .

239
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,591
and a car

240
01:03:21,974 --> 01:03:23,141
Okay

241
01:03:53,088 --> 01:03:54,130
Hurry up!

242
01:03:54,214 --> 01:03:55,340
Javi's waiting for you !

243
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:20,865
We need to talk, Javi

244
01:04:21,617 --> 01:04:23,284
You look worried

245
01:04:23,577 --> 01:04:24,994
The shootout was
the final straw

246
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:26,788
The government
is closing the prison

247
01:04:27,081 --> 01:04:28,998
They've tried that before

248
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:31,709
It's a surprise raid,
even I don't know when

249
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,878
2000 soldiers. . .
police. . .snipers

250
01:04:38,384 --> 01:04:39,967
I have to get out of here

251
01:04:40,386 --> 01:04:41,886
It won't be easy

252
01:04:42,388 --> 01:04:43,763
If Armando lets you out. . .

253
01:04:43,806 --> 01:04:46,682
they'll go after him. . .
then the Mayor,
all the way up

254
01:04:47,017 --> 01:04:48,226
I can't go to another prison

255
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:50,645
Maybe for a while
until things calm down

256
01:04:51,021 --> 01:04:52,480
No, I can't risk
losing the kid

257
01:04:57,403 --> 01:04:58,820
I need that liver transplant

258
01:04:58,904 --> 01:05:00,405
And I'll be too weak to move

259
01:05:00,614 --> 01:05:03,741
So get me an ambulance
and barricade this place

260
01:05:03,826 --> 01:05:05,785
Nothing interrupts
the operation

261
01:05:16,505 --> 01:05:18,005
What do we do with Barnes?

262
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:21,259
Have our boys up north
kill him once Frank is dead

263
01:05:34,189 --> 01:05:35,273
What if he doesn't
kill Frank?

264
01:05:39,611 --> 01:05:43,197
Give him forty-eight hours. . .
then kill him

265
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,685
Regina, it's time!

266
01:08:17,894 --> 01:08:19,020
Move it!

267
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,400
Get in

268
01:08:25,527 --> 01:08:26,694
Don't come out,
no matter what

269
01:09:58,203 --> 01:09:59,286
I admire your courage

270
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:00,621
I didn't expect any less

271
01:10:02,374 --> 01:10:05,960
You know we'll kill you
and find the kid

272
01:10:07,462 --> 01:10:09,004
Why waste more time?

273
01:10:11,299 --> 01:10:12,550
I treated you well

274
01:10:12,759 --> 01:10:13,884
Took care of you both

275
01:10:14,761 --> 01:10:16,303
I tried to find
someone else

276
01:10:16,888 --> 01:10:18,013
But time ran out

277
01:12:57,299 --> 01:12:58,632
But I'm tired

278
01:13:01,928 --> 01:13:03,053
You want my liver?

279
01:13:03,889 --> 01:13:05,389
Here's your fucking liver

280
01:18:21,331 --> 01:18:22,331
Ladies

281
01:18:22,999 --> 01:18:24,208
Here

282
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:45,729
. . .but you got
the money, right?

283
01:18:46,564 --> 01:18:47,564
I paid you, fucker!

284
01:18:47,649 --> 01:18:48,649
They're here

285
01:18:48,942 --> 01:18:50,234
Go fuck your mother!

286
01:18:56,741 --> 01:18:58,784
Make sure Armando
has the ambulance ready

287
01:19:00,536 --> 01:19:03,038
Leave that open
for a quick getaway

288
01:19:03,998 --> 01:19:06,041
Nobody gets in here!

289
01:23:21,797 --> 01:23:23,173
Park over there

290
01:23:56,541 --> 01:23:57,541
Go fuck yourself!

291
01:24:05,758 --> 01:24:06,758
He'll be okay

292
01:24:13,975 --> 01:24:14,975
Thank you

293
01:24:15,643 --> 01:24:17,227
They were assholes

294
01:24:18,187 --> 01:24:19,479
Just like my husband

295
01:24:23,484 --> 01:24:24,484
Stop!

296
01:24:26,153 --> 01:24:27,654
It's an emergency!

297
01:24:28,281 --> 01:24:30,073
Help us to the ambulance!

298
01:24:31,033 --> 01:24:32,033
Be careful

299
01:24:35,162 --> 01:24:36,162
What happened?

300
01:24:36,205 --> 01:24:38,081
Male, ten years old

301
01:24:38,708 --> 01:24:40,333
Under anesthesia
for liver transplant

302
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:42,210
Vital signs are stable

303
01:24:46,924 --> 01:24:48,174
He needs to get
to a hospital

304
01:25:23,669 --> 01:25:24,711
We're in a hurry

305
01:27:10,151 --> 01:27:11,192
To us

306
01:27:19,660 --> 01:27:20,827
Can I bite you?

307
01:27:23,497 --> 01:27:24,497
Yes

308
01:27:25,374 --> 01:27:26,416
Only if it's really hard

309
01:27:26,667 --> 01:27:28,084
And don't leave any marks

310
01:27:31,213 --> 01:27:32,213
Come

311
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:33,590
Hurry up

312
01:27:34,884 --> 01:27:36,301
I'll be back

313
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Forced Subs by voodoo
