I wasn't snooping.
I just--

01:56:45,701 --> 01:56:48,621
I was looking for a needle

I bought that

<i>So many things.

1530
01:57:04,094 --> 01:57:07,681
That day when he was late
coming back from Rome,

1531
01:57:07,765 --> 01:57:09,683
I tried to tell you this.

1532
01:57:09,767 --> 01:57:13,228
He was with another girl.
I'm not talking about Meredith, either.

1533
01:57:13,312 --> 01:57:16,565
Another girl
that we met in a bar.

1534
01:57:16,607 --> 01:57:19,693
<i>He couldn't be faithful</i>
<i>for five minutes.

<i>So when he makes a promise,

He has so many realities, Dickie,
and he believes them all.

1539
01:57:30,704 --> 01:57:33,916
He lies. He lies.

1540

he doesn't even realize he's doing it.

And today,

1542
01:57:41,799 --> 01:57:45,594
I really started wondering whether
he may have killed Freddie.

1543
