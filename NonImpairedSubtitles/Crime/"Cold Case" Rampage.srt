00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,370
The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,640
September 23,1995

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,200
- yo,is that thing on or what?
- Yeah,yeah,dawg,look at that red light.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,820
- See it?
- yet.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,370
yo,what's up,mamacitas?

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,990
Oh,shwing!

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,630
stop being a reject.
Give me that.

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,190
you're about to enter another dimension.

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,950
It's a dimension not only of sight and of sound...

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,330
but of tweakers,preps,horny housewives and morons galore.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,530
It's the ninth circle of hell.

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,250
The sweaty armpit of suburbia.

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,110
You've just crossed over into...

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,140
- the mall.
- The mall.

15
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,190
- Shop till you drop.
- Right on.

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,560
eenie,meanie,miney,mo.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,720
Catch a tiger by its toe.

18
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,020
If he hollers,let him go.

19
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,130
Eenie...
meanie...

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,020
miney...

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,010
mo.

22
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,450
looks like it's homeslice's lucky day.

23
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,900
Ah,dope.

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,950
a regular saturday afternoon in america's town square.

25
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,940
The city is still reeling  weeks after two teenage gunmen
opened fire at the woodland valley mall,

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,180
killing 15 bystanders before taking their own lives.

27
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,530
The lieutenant still got you in deep freeze,lil?

28
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,050
The man knows how to hold a grudge.

29
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,960
This about that fugitive,what's his face?

30
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,770
It's joseph,and it's past tense,the fugitive part.

31
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,840
Is that a fact?

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,360
At least from what I hear.

33
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,420
I wonder where he's,uh,docking his tugboat these days.

34
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,510
You got me.

35
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,830
Okay.
So,scotty,you coming with tonight?

36
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,390
- Why,what's up?
- Nurses.

37
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,820
Nice.

38
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,650
Oh,milking that newfound bachelorhood,huh?

39
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,740
Every drop.

40
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,010
- Morning,boss.
- Scotty.Nick.

41
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,950
Boss.

42
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,330
You remember the coulter-hanlon job back in '95?

43
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,120
Two kids opened up with a shotgun and a tec-9 in the mall?

44
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,290
Yeah.
Took forever to process the scene.

45
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,820
The doers offed themselves after taking out,what,uh,15 people?

46
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,700
The contractors renovating the air vents found a video camera.

47
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,340
And?

48
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,050
Well,it looks like it was used to film the massacre.

49
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,080
Yo,what's up,mamacitas?

50
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,010
Oh,shwing!

51
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,080
stop being a reject.
Give me that.

52
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,730
A real laugh riot,these two.

53
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,580
The survivors say they busted a gut the whole time they were mowing folks down.

54
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,660
Hell of a thing to get on tape.

55
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,410
Still The only footage that exists.

56
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,460
No working surveillance cameras in that wing of the mall,only at the two exits.

57
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,610
The survivors never mentioned the kids having a video camera.

58
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,300
A lot of times in shootings like this,people's memories are shaky.

59
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,170
One witness claims the gunmen were wearing red baseball caps,another swears they were yellow.

60
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,600
Killer kids.
First this then colombine.

61
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,890
Glad I don't got kids.

62
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,750
I thought I saw something.
Rewind it.

63
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,540
Right there.

64
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,540
Did you see his face?

65
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,870
Neal was handing off the video camera.

66
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,230
So what?

67
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,090
Who was he handing it to?

68
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,770
Everyone.

69
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,990
the third shooter?

"I am the destroyer,"the apocolypse,"the widowmaker."

74
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,320
I am a rifle,I am a gun.

75
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,150
"Look down the barrel of my hate,we're going to have some fun."

76
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,350
Words to live by.

77
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,570
Cameron's journal,two days before the shoot-out.

78
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,570
And neal's artwork broadcasting their intentions loud and clear.

79
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,240
According to classmates,everyone knew the game plan.
The boys talked about it 24/7.

80
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,860
But no one believed them.

81
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,420
Whatever happened to kids punching each other out?

82
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,340
Now they're mowing each other down.

83
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,020
And we still don't know why.

84
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,790
Childhood buddies,uh,juniors at lakefield high
at the time of the killing.

85
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,060
On weekends,neal pushed a broom at the mall.

86
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,710
Cameron was a counter boy at the cinnamon king.

87
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,370
Well,maybe our third shooter works at the mall,too.

88
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,610
Stashes a video camera after the rampage,gets out of dodge.

89
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,340
Where'd the camera come from?

90
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,090
Running the serial numbers.

91
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:57,210
According to the boy's computer logs,"the destroyer"
and "the apocolypse" were monikers they used online.

92
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,740
Big fans of the game called  renegade massacre.

93
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,820
What all young minds should aspire to.

94
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,630
If cameron was "the destroyer" and neal was "the apocolypse,"

95
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,650
who's "the widowmaker"?

96
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,610
- Our third shooter.
- The name doesn't come up in the logs.

97
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,060
Well,let's check with the parents,
could have went to school with him.

98
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,510
Bring in the survivors,too.
See what they remember.

99
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,500
Cameron's folks are still in town.
Neal's family relocated to georgia two years ago.

100
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,840
If I were them,I'd run for the hills,too.

101
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,070
I knew my kid wasn't the ringleader.

102
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,160
Cameron was always well-behaved.
He was polite.

103
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,780
He was more of a follower,really.

104
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,190
He play a lot of online video games,mr.Coulter?

105
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,660
I tried to get him into sports,but...

106
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,340
he never took to them.

107
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,110
You familiar with a game called  renegade massacre?

108
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,050
It's just a game.

109
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,950
Did neal and cameron ever play online games with other kids?

110
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,340
All the time.
Dayton moore was one.

111
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,370
Dayton moore?
He was one of the survivors.

112
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,290
He used to live down the block--
the three of them were thick as thieves until high school.

113
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,120
He's a real bossy kid.
He bullied cameron and neal all the time.

114
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,010
Right.
Thanks for your time.

115
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,440
You're going to interrogate him,aren't you?

116
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,980
We'll be in touch,mr.Coulter.

117
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,670
It's easier for you to pretend we're monsters,isn't it?

118
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,580
Excuse me?

119
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,260
Just like the newspapers did.
The tv.

120
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,090
What everyone forgets,that day we lost a child,too.

121
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,750
My wife,her name is jackie.
She's in there.

122
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,250
Please,help,my daughter's in there!

123
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,520
The survivors are coming out.

124
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,880
Coming out.

125
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,040
Oh,my god,they're coming out!

126
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,110
Mommy!

127
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,040
Dayton!

128
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,770
Dayton!

129
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,620
Oh,baby.

130
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,710
There'S...

131
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,560
there's more coming out,right?

132
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,770
There's got to be more coming out,right?

133
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,800
Are you the parents of cameron coulter?

134
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,730
Yes,we are.

135
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,710
- You need to come with us.
- Why?

136
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,980
No,we...
we've got to wait here for cameron.

137
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,520
We think your son might have been involved.

138
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,190
What?

139
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,540
No,no,no.
You're-you're mistaken.

140
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,180
My boy's not involved!

141
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,110
Jim,what is goingn?

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,440
Oh,jim.

143
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,550
everyone blamed us.

144
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,800
We were just an ordinary family...

145
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,820
just like your own.

146
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,410
Ordinary families don't have military assault rifles at home.

147
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,000
A man has a right to his hobbies.

148
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,800
I'm a hunter.

149
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,280
What kind of animal do you hunt,with a tec-9 semiautomatic?

150
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,630
Ld"could you leave that door open?

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,100
Me and closed rooms don't really mix so well.

152
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,580
Sure.
Detectives rush,miller.

153
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,480
Always looking for the exit,huh?

154
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,520
11 years later,you'd think I'd be over it.

155
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,400
You grew up with cameron and neal?

156
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,570
In grade school,that's pretty much it.
Why?

157
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,630
You like playing games online,dayton?

158
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,410
No,not really.

159
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,500
The game  renegade massacre?
Ring any bells?

160
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,700
I don't know.

161
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,540
How about "the widowmaker"?

162
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,140
That was my online id.
I gamed every once in a while,so what?

163
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,240
- Then why lie?
- Because I stopped playing with those psychos way before...

164
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,430
- the,the,uh,incident.
- Why?

165
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,400
To them it wasn't just a game,it was...

166
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,840
it was practice.

167
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,810
So maybe a closet geek like yourself got caught up,too.

168
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,590
- Took it past role-playing,made it real.
- Look,lady,I was a jock--

169
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,710
pick of the high school litter.
I didn't need a fantasy life.

170
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,440
You did online.

171
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,830
The last thing I needed was to be seen in public with those freaks.

172
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,700
check out butter face.

173
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,720
Everything's hot,"but her face."

174
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,310
*********and what do I get  for my pain?

175
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,100
Bet clearasil's making a killing off of him.

176
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,150
Come on,man,leave the dork alone.

177
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,670
Whatever.

178
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,880
********

179
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,420
got something for you.

180
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,410
- what?
- You missed a fry,dude.

181
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,030
what fry?

182
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,400
that one.

183
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,140
whoops.

184
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,590
you know,
you are one talented litter getter.

185
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,270
someone should take an uzi to this freaking mall.

186
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,110
what do you think...

187
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,770
dudes?

188
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,340
when did this happen?

189
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,740
Uh,a few months before they went ballistic.

190
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,700
I was a jerk.

191
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,550
We all were.

192
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,940
Maybe if we hadn't,then,you know,none of this would of happened.

193
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,330
He killed a lot of innocent people.

194
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,980
You're not responsible for that.

195
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,510
Then who is?

196
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,430
they look so normal.

197
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,820
Are thosthe kids who did it?

198
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,240
Yeah.

199
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,280
Some of the victims,too.

200
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,350
Went to the same school.

201
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,920
Could be the third shooter's in here.

202
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,640
You getting any closer to finding him?

203
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,840
Most time,the doer's already in the box.

204
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,090
Really?

205
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,890
Yeah.

206
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,030
Really.

207
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,740
Aren't you going to put that away?

208
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,710
- No.
- Why not?

209
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,950
'Cause...

210
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,020
it helps me remember.

211
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,150
Keeping photos of the victims up there.

212
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,240
Remember what?

213
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,530
you must of had my photo up there,too.

214
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,110
No way.

215
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,810
rush.

216
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,110
Been going through the security footage from the mall.

217
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,170
Okay.

218
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,250
- There's something you got to see.
- Be there in a few.

219
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,050
I'll be a couple hours.

220
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,270
Sorry.

221
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,000
You got to do what you got to do.

222
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,080
you might as well get some sleep now.

223
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,510
Why's that?

224
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,470
'Cause you won't get much later.

225
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,910
Only two ways in or out of this part of the mall.
Security cameras were at each exit.

226
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,490
So,we can see who went in with cameron and neal.

227
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,120
Nope.
Crowd's too thick,couldn't even spot the boys.

228
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,400
What about who came out after the shooting started?

229
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,640
Take a look.

230
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,520
3:05,the shooting begins.

231
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,040
Trapping 40 civilians inside that wing.

232
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,400
And our third shooter.

233
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,270
The rampage continues for 15 minutes
and ends when swat shows up right here.

234
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,730
So how'd our third shooter get out?

235
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,130
That's what we were wondering.

236
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,200
Well,maybe our guy offed himself.

237
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,730
Got caught in the cross fire.

238
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,880
Cameron and neal had the only self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

239
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,340
So,if our third shooter isn't one of the dead...

240
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,980
he's posing as one of the survivors.

241
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,300
*********I7 no dice.

242
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,320
Still Keep at it,one of them's got to have seen something.

243
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,780
A lot of blacked out memories.
Tough going back.

244
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,970
The bottom line people don't want to remember.

245
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,410
Hey.

246
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,350
Late night with the nurses?

247
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,340
Somebody's got to play doctor.

248
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,840
What have you got,nick?

249
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,340
Lead on the video camera,traced it back to
an electronic store at the mall.

250
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,940
Turns out it was stolen a few days before the attack.

251
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,840
Great.

252
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,090
One of our survivors,a kid named davie schulman,
was a stock boy there.

253
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,390
You have a talk with him?

254
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,840
Miller's on it.

255
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,330
Well,meanwhile,let's keep interviewing the rest of them.

256
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,830
Scotty,you got a minute?

257
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,520
Get the door,huh?

258
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,420
Detective renaldi at west,you're familiar right?

259
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,640
Yeah,sure.

260
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,020
He gave me the heads up on a job they been working.

261
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,230
Okay.

262
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,530
A coach at A...
community boxing program,early 80s.

263
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,870
A pedophile.

264
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,030
Is that right.

265
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,930
Your brother's name came up.

266
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,720
What,mike?
What's he got to do with it?

267
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,150
Well,it says here he was in the program when he was 12.

268
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
So what?

269
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,970
Well,one of the guy's former students is going to testify,
says he should,too.

270
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,850
He's got it wrong.

271
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,760
- Well,you might want to take a look.

272
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,800
Like I said,boss,my brother's got nothing to do with it so--

273
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,070
the guy's still out there by the way,coaching.

274
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,770
Until this thing goes to court.

275
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,200
No harm in looking,right?

276
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,980
I kind of lost my trust in people after that.

277
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,270
I guess that's why I ended up here.

278
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
We're talking to all the survivors davie.

279
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,940
There might have been a third shooter.

280
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,070
Third shooter?

281
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,690
You see anyone else that day?
With cameron and neal.

282
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,050
I barely remember anything.

283
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,710
Flashes,sometimes.
It was so loud.

284
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,940
The gunfire.

285
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,440
I didn't know bullets could do that to people.

286
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,490
It's not like in the movies.

287
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,400
No,it's not.

288
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,960
I don'T...
you really like to talk about it?

289
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,480
The third shooter was using a video camera.

290
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,650
It was stolen from the store you worked at.

291
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,700
Got something to share,davie?

292
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,900
- You think I stole it.
- Did you?

293
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,140
No.

294
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,760
But you know who did.

295
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,090
Davie hey,what's up?
Papi chulo.

296
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,530
Hey.

297
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,040
These are cool video cameras.
Maybe we can make some porn.

298
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,890
Bow-chicka-bow-ow.

299
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,400
I got to have one,make a distraction for me,okay?

300
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,500
A distraction,like-like what?

301
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,910
Like,throw up or something.

302
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,390
just kidding,davie.

303
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,150
they should get a room.

304
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,810
He was a jerk to you,T.
Screw him.

305
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,680
Zack's not that bad.

306
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,360
Then why's he act like he doesn't even know you.

307
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,300
'Cause I'm the hit and run queen.

308
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,750
Quit talking about yourself like that.

309
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,030
Just thought he'd be different,I guess.

310
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,310
What a sucker.

311
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,960
maybe you deserve
someone who treats you better.

312
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,450
someone like...
who?

313
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,420
anyway,I'm out of here.

314
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,250
Uh,what about the video camera?

315
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,990
What about it?
What,you think I'm klepto or something?

316
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,690
See you...
see you later,I guess.

317
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,140
Not if I see you first.

318
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,440
Thank you.

319
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,750
tina was a lost kind of soul.

320
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,500
She wouldn't of hurt anyone.

321
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,830
You keep in touch?

322
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,380
I dropped out of school after,you know,
we kind of drifted apart.

323
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,340
Thanks for your time,davie.
If you think of anything else...

324
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,600
here's my card.

325
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,820
I was a bad girl,desperate for attention.

326
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,420
Shoplifting was means to an end.

327
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,440
How'd the video camera you stole end up in those boys' hands?

328
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,090
What are you talking about?

329
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,790
Cameron and neal used it to film their shooting spree,tina.

330
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,690
What?
Are you sure?

331
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,110
You knew them,right?

332
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,290
From high school.
Yeah,but...

333
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,240
those guys were seriously damaged goods.

334
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,730
Talked about killing all the time,everyone knew it.

335
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,770
Maybe we should have listened to them,huh?

336
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,750
Tell us what happened to the video camera.

337
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,500
I got busted,okay?

338
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,230
- Security guard took me to mall jail.
- Then what?

339
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,350
He threatened to call my folks but hell
if i was going to let that happen.

340
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,520
quite the little klepto...

341
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,830
ain't we?

342
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,210
so...

343
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,910
what are you going to do about it...
big boy?

344
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,240
What do you think I'm going to do about it...

345
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,200
girlfriend?

346
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,650
I'm going to call your parents...

347
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,460
that's what.

348
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,960
Yo,barry.

349
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,030
You stay put.

350
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,980
The mall's entire surveillance system.

351
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,980
Lay of the land.

352
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,910
so you can see everything from here.

353
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,080
Half these cameras are for show.

354
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,930
A.K.A. "Dummies."

355
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,530
What about the cameras on the second level?

356
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,470
Yeah,the ones near the escalators.

357
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,460
100% fake-o'S.
Management's a bunch of tight wads.

358
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,760
So you could basically take a machine gun
in this place and nobody'd ever know.

359
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,430
Or care.

360
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,680
Just imagine the look on all their faces.

361
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,980
That'd be something to see.

362
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,280
All those happy little folks.

363
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,860
Not so happy no more.

364
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,400
Why was he showing them the mall security system?

365
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,310
'Cause he was a loser or desperate for attention.

366
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,240
What happened to the video camera?

367
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,470
He never ended up calling my parents.
Guess he pocketed it for himself.

368
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,510
Barry lewis?

369
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,440
- Yeah,that's me.
- Philly P.D.

370
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,190
Here about the mall shootout back in '95.

371
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,240
That's not something I spend a lot of time reminiscing on.

372
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,650
Wonder why you never mentioned swiping that video camera.

373
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,610
Video camera?

374
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,650
I love it when they play dumb.

375
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,990
The camera you used to film your little shoot-out.

376
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,240
Whoa.

377
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,870
Hold up there,now.
I was shot,if you don't recall.

378
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,690
Great way to take the stink off,what with your condition and all.

379
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,670
What exactly are you accusing me of?

380
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,620
Being a mall rent-a-cop on a power trip.

381
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,980
Planning a massacre with two whacked-out assassins.

382
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,740
And filming it.
That about covers it.

383
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,820
Those kids stole that camera off my desk.

384
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,170
How convenient.

385
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,940
Still doesn't explain why you were
showing them the surveillance system.

386
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,010
they gave me respect.

387
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,790
So you gave two sociopaths the keys to the kingdom?

388
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,570
Didn't matter in the end.

389
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,210
Me showing them the system.

390
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,560
What do you mean it didn't matter?

391
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,880
Those kids weren't trying not to be seen.

392
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,340
They wanted to be on camera.

393
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,760
Why would they want that?

394
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,080
Same reason everybody else does.

395
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,170
Fame.

396
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,290
smile for the camera,sucker.

397
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,130
Hey...

398
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,720
hey...

399
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,550
hey...

400
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,880
let him bleed.

401
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,150
Hey.

402
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,970
Hurry.

403
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,740
look at me.

404
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,610
Come on.

405
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,000
No,wake up,wake up.
Look at me.Look.

406
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,660
I ca...
I can't feel nothin'.

407
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,880
Hey,hey,where's your wallet?

408
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,040
What?
Huh?

409
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,390
Your wallet.
You got your wife's picture in here or your kids?

410
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,800
You think about them,'cause you can't die.

411
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,120
I don'T...
I don't got nobody.

412
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,030
- sorry.
- No,no.

413
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,340
Then you got to live.
Okay?

414
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:55,010
Okay,you got to live.
'Cause if you get out of here,

415
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,240
then maybe you can find somebody,okay?

416
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,530
You just got to live.
okay?

417
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,080
I-I-I did this.

418
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,260
All of it.

419
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,760
It's all my F...
it's all my fault.

420
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,060
I thought I was gonna die.

421
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,510
What that girl said pulled me through.

422
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,270
What did that kid mean,"I did this,all of it"?

423
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,250
you got me.

424
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,200
Could be he's our third shooter.

425
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,900
Makes sense.
'Cause I certainly wasn'T.

426
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,540
- You know,you guys can't keep me in here.
- Oh,we can do whatever we want,dayton--

427
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,190
cowe'"a the police.

428
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,400
Still We know what you did.
You told barry and tina about it.

429
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,430
you know,I don't have to be in here.
I'm leaving.

430
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,640
Sit down.

431
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,160
You're about to enter another dimension.

432
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,750
It is a dimension not only of sight but of sound.

433
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,330
Full of tweakers,preps,
horny housewives and morons galore.

434
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,380
- It is the ninth circle of hell.
- Turn that off.

435
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,220
You played  renegade massacre for hours with those boys.

436
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,310
It was just a stupid video game.

437
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,700
Maybe playtime got boring after a while.
Maybe you needed the real deal.

438
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,450
- Were you in on their plan?
- No!

439
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,260
- Sure about that?
- I'm leaving.

440
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,960
Come here!
Is this...

441
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,810
is this a game to you?

442
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,750
Turn it off.

443
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,630
Please.

444
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,650
please.

445
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,760
I tried to stop them.

446
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,460
I knew it was wrong...

447
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,260
what they were gonna do.

448
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,950
- Cameron and neal.
- No.

449
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,660
Who?

450
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,580
Zack...

451
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,100
and the others.

452
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,080
Your friends?

453
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,840
What'd they have to do with the shooting?

454
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,710
'Cause of what happened earlier that day.

455
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,580
I tried to stop them.

456
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,280
Maybe if I had...

457
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,840
none of this would have happened.

458
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,960
- what's going on,man?Teddy said...
- shh!

459
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,350
What's up,dudes?

460
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,900
who's your daddy now?

461
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,400
Whoa,hold up there.

462
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,510
- Where do you think you're going to?
- Stop it!

463
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,590
- Leave her alone.
- Shut up,faggot.

464
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,070
No.
Stop it!

465
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,520
Stop it!

466
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,330
No!

467
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,980
- Giddyap!
- Stop!

468
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,400
No!
No!

469
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,340
Stop it!
Get off of me!

470
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,400
No!
No!

471
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,600
Stop it!
Get off!

472
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,490
- Tina!
- Davie!

473
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,600
Davie!

474
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,280
Davie!

475
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,300
Davie!

476
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,100
I'll kill all of you!

477
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,570
- I tried to stop them.
- I'm gonna put a bullet into all of your heads.

478
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,320
I tried.

479
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,300
I did.

480
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,580
When did this happen?

481
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,220
An hour before the shooting started.

482
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,040
A bullet in all their heads.

483
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,500
You wanted them to pay.

484
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,720
Don't blame you.
Someone did that to my girl...

485
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:10,740
forget about it.

486
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,060
So you reached out to cameron and neal.

487
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,340
Everyone knew their plan,knew they had guns.

488
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,130
And you had all the motive in the world.

489
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,720
- I didn't do anything.
- Now,come on,davie,

490
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,620
these guys mauled the girl you're in love with?

491
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,750
You got to settle the score.

492
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,120
Must have hurt...

493
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,730
being in love with someone...

494
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,320
who didn't love you back.

495
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,850
Yeah,it did.

496
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,740
But maybe if you saved her from the big bad wolves,

497
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,800
- she would?
- I didn't save her.

498
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,890
You tried.

499
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,890
No...

500
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,810
you don't understand.

501
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,920
I would have done anything for tina...

502
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,260
'cause all I ever wanted was for her to like me...

503
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,720
but I let her down when she needed me the most.

504
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,240
tina?
Are you okay?

505
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,980
No,uh,just don't touch me.

506
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,670
Sorry.

507
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,750
I just don't want to be touched right now.

508
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,030
you want a frozen yogurt or something?

509
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,630
we should go to the police.

510
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,100
The police?

511
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,620
They'll arrest zack a-and all of them for--

512
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,450
for what they did to you.

513
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,830
you still like him?

514
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,690
- No,it's not that.
- Then what?

515
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,290
well,I mean,it's just that zack...

516
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,680
he didn't force me,you know?

517
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,290
why are you looking at me like that?

518
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,900
davie?

519
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,480
Maybe...

520
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,240
maybe going to the cops isn't such a good idea.

521
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,900
It isn't?

522
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,930
You said so yourself.

523
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,930
You let him do it.

524
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,240
Kind of like you let everyone...

525
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,160
do it.

526
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,920
so what's the big deal?

527
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,850
tina?

528
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,500
Tina?

529
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,860
I should have stopped her.

530
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,220
- But...
- you didn'T.

531
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,100
I didn't believe anything bad would really happen.

532
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,980
No one did.

533
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,400
the boss and lil just headed over to the mall.

534
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,840
The mall?
Why?

535
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,430
Tina walked in a few minutes ago...

536
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,270
with a gun.

537
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,230
You got the area cleared?

538
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,520
She'll be killed if they go in.

539
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,680
She's armed,lil.
I don't have a choice.

540
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,420
- Let me talk to her.
- No way.

541
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,840
Tina doesn't want to hurt anyone but herself.

542
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,820
If she raises the gun,I'm not holding them back.

543
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,600
All right,let her through.

544
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,760
Heads up,guys.
There's one of our coming in.

545
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,650
I'm going to sit down.

546
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,260
If that's okay with you.

547
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,310
Steady...

548
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,410
I know why you're here,tina.

549
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,610
I know what happened to you.

550
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:19,210
I haven't set foot in this place for...

551
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,020
for 11 years.

552
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,450
The same music,the same kids,the same heartbreak.

553
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,590
Nothing changes.

554
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,740
No.
It doesn'T.

555
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,220
I should have done this a long time ago.

556
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,420
Like cameron,neal.

557
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,330
So when does it end?

558
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,280
The violence.

559
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,920
I wanted to hurt them like they hurt me.

560
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,850
I have to pay for what I did.

561
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,060
No.

562
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,980
For every gun that's fired,

563
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,570
someone can't be in a closed room

564
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:05,410
or walk or see their child again.

565
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,590
It's not just you who pays,tina.

566
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,900
It never is.

567
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,470
I know.

568
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,340
Give me the gun.

569
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,800
Give me the gun.

570
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,120
They were little kids,they were moms and dads

571
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,770
and they never hurt anybody.

572
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,350
And it didn't matter to cameron and neal.
They were human time bombs.

573
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,870
Just waiting to go off.

574
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,440
I lit the fuse.

575
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,140
Want to make a porn film?

576
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,310
Bow-chicka-bow-ow.

577
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,770
Girlfriend's seriously tweaked.

578
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,790
Or I could film you...

579
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,890
killing everyone.

580
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,340
You're always talking about it,right?
So do it already.

581
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,360
Okay,let's get out of here.

582
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,930
What,are you scared or something?

583
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,510
What about I kill you first?

584
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,870
Then who's going to make you famous,big boy?

585
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,950
Girl's got a point.

586
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,150
So what's the plan?

587
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,180
Kill 'em all.

588
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,080
Kill everybody.

589
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,450
Get the camera.

590
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,210
did you see his face?

591
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,350
Everybody.

592
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,010
this is it,bro.

593
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,610
Roll credits,dawg.

594
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,510
the end.

595
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,050
please...

596
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,110
wake up.
