00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:00,083
Antitrust (2001) - 23.976 fps

2
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,697
This business

3
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,784
is a living organism.

4
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:37,496
Multiplying constantly
surrounded by predators.

5
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:41,500
There's no rule for
idle time or second guessing,

6
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,294
New discoveries are made hourly.

7
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:48,298
New ideas are ready to be
devoured and redefined.

8
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,176
This business is binary.

9
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,387
You're a one or a zero.

10
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:57,391
Alive or dead.

11
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,483
There is no second place.

12
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,863
It's been suggested
by the media and congress

13
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:14,867
that you're violating antitrust laws,
and threatening competition.

14
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,786
Mr. Winston, can you reasonably deny

15
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,163
that you have a monopoly in this area?

16
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,582
Well, the only monopoly

17
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:25,294
we have at N.U.R.V, congressman,
is monopoly on excellence.

18
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,795
This is still a free market.

19
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,798
But a free market encourages
competition.

20
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,466
You prevent it.

21
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,178
Congressman, I don't need to remind you
that the essence of competition

22
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:36,263
has always been quite simple.

23
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,266
Any kid working in a garage anywhere
in the world,

24
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:43,270
with a good idea, can put us
out of business.

25
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:49,568
You can try a version qualification
scheme if you have the best driver.

26
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,278
Wait a second.. go back up.

27
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,696
Move, move.

28
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:56,658
Teddy, I think I found our bottleneck.

29
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:06,460
- You did it!
- Yee-Haw!

30
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,588
God! That feels good.

31
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,298
It's gorgeous!

32
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:15,260
We're geeks.

33
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,477
Three months from today,
N.U.R.V will launch SYNAPSE,

34
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,688
transforming the way
humans communicate,

35
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,689
With Synapse,

36
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,776
the entire world will be able
to send or receive any message

37
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:34,780
be it audio, video or text
on any medium.

38
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:41,578
SYNAPSE will fully unite
the global village.

39
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,296
You've set yourself real
ticking clock here, Gary.

40
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:55,259
All of your competitors are desperate
to get to the marketplace with this
technology before you.

41
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,177
It has even been suggested

42
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,097
that you won't hit
this very ambitious launch date.

43
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,765
We're going to hit that date.
You can bet on it.

44
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,183
How can you be sure?

45
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,187
We'll do whatever it takes...
to get there.

46
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:24,079
Pace yourself, Brian.

47
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,874
Over here...

48
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,083
Milo, what do you think of this?

49
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,378
I know I promised my mom
we're gonna make this garage famous,

50
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,381
but I really don't think
we're gonna be here that long.

51
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:38,385
'Cause I've got us 3 appointments
with the venture capitalists.

52
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,888
Oh, that is fantastic

53
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:44,892
I can stop taking calls from
those corporate recruitment losers.

54
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,978
I'll do the talking, Brian.
Here's your shirt, Milo.

55
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,271
Guys, what are these?

56
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,398
Don't you know? The worse you look,
the smarter they think you are.

57
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,859
They are going to think
you're a genius, Brian.

58
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,779
I just said "Milo" and "Teddy",
and the wallets flew open!

59
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,781
They were dying to give me their money.

60
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:03,577
You guys are the greatest duo,
since Hewlett and Packard.

61
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,661
Lennon and McCartney.

62
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,081
Ben and Jerry!

63
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,583
I'm Lennon, okay Teddy?

64
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,587
Does that make me Yoko?

65
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,591
Alice, you've got to make him do
this startup with Teddy.

66
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,595
Gary, if he wants to go take a few
interviews... check out his options,

67
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,766
as his friend,
I think you should support him in that.

68
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,479
Want to know the best way
to manipulate somebody?

69
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,772
Yeah.

70
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,190
Don't try.

71
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,693
"As graduating students for the
Stanford University Computer
Science department,

72
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,197
"you have a magnificent foundation...
in theory.

73
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,075
"What you need is a creative,
innovative..."
- So pretentious!

74
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,994
- The guy's a fascist monopolist.
- Exactly.

75
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,998
The guy knows how to get people's
attention. He does.

76
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,793
Shut up... shut up!

77
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,378
I'm trying to listen.

78
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,462
"...will field your questions.

79
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,589
"Thanks for taking the time
to check us out.

80
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,759
"I'll look forward to seeing some
of you up here at the NURV campus
in the near future."

81
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,388
- Questions, cool!
- I've got a question for him.

82
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:07,599
"If you guys have questions, fire away."

83
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,562
Why not make SYNAPSE open source?

84
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,190
Don't you have enough money? Heh.

85
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,067
Here is an interesting question:

86
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,486
"What kind of beverages do you offer
your programmers?"

87
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,780
- Oh, come on!
- What did you expect?

88
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,490
- He's avoiding the issue, man.
- You can't ask him that.

89
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,994
He should run for president, or something.

90
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,998
I'm just gonna of throw these at you.
You know, like they do at the zoo.

91
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,295
Hello.

92
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,380
It's for you.

93
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,675
- Hello
- Milo? This is Gary Winston.

94
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,594
I've heard great things about
your work, I'm...

95
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,888
hoping you and your friend Teddy
can come up here.

96
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,764
Hey, Larry, you still got
my Union Jack CD?

97
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,765
No, I gave it back.

98
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,059
Ok, I don't know who this is but
your timing really blows

99
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,187
'cause I just saw him in a live chat.

100
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:56,773
Right, well, a pair of airline tickets
are on there way to you,

101
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,777
I'd love to show you
some of the things we're doing here.

102
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,075
Who was it?

103
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,577
Gary Winston.

104
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,579
Ha, that would be funny.

105
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:14,583
I just spoke to Gary Winston?

106
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,086
I can't believe you're not going
to take that ticket!

107
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:18,879
Give it to me!

108
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,380
You don't want to work there, Brian.

109
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,592
They squeeze everybody out of business.
They get bigger and fatter...

110
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,385
That's why I want to work there.

111
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,764
You sure he didn't ask for my number?

112
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,682
Milo, we can't go up there.

113
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,684
They don't even know
the meaning of open source.

114
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,561
You know this,
we've talked about this.

115
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,271
They just want to own everything!

116
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,690
- They clone stuff, reverse engineer it...
- I know

117
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,694
Everybody is stuck with their
inferior proprietary version.

118
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,197
They're being investigated by
the justice department for Christ's sake.

119
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:46,698
Tell him, Larry.

120
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:50,661
I think that he should go up there and
check it out if he is curious.

121
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:53,789
You do?

122
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,793
Sure, I mean... it's your life.

123
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:01,797
I need another beer.

124
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,186
So, you couldn't convince
your friend Teddy to come?

125
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,982
No, he is pretty tight with his folks.

126
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,359
Yeah? We can move them up here
same goes for yours.

127
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,570
My parents are dead.

128
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,488
I'm sorry man.

129
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,365
So how far is the campus?

130
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:32,369
We're not going to campus.

131
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,574
All I can say is
it's unfortunate.

132
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:13,493
We offered a lot of money.
A substantial amount of money, Gary.

133
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,286
No sale.

134
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,789
Can we buy into their stock? Or is that
a Justice Department problem too?

135
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,793
There is no stock, Randy.
I mean there's no company!

136
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:26,089
Gary Winston's office.
Can you hold, please?

137
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,799
Thanks for holding.

138
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:31,762
Yes, he is in a conference
right now. Can I take a message?

139
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,188
The cold, hard facts are
that anything is possible.

140
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,983
Anything, anything. You're just not
thinking creatively.

141
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,361
I have every confidence that you
can do that, Phil.

142
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:51,365
- It's a difficult one but we're
going to prevail.
- All right, all right.

143
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,076
Gary Winston's office.

144
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:57,287
Let me check that for you.

145
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,497
I'm sorry, I don't see anything new.

146
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:01,375
Milo?

147
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,876
Hi

148
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,797
It's not everyday we have genius
in the house.

149
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:08,966
- Want a soda pop or something?
- No, thanks.

150
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:12,970
Come on in.

151
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,185
Digital canvas.

152
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,480
The house knows the paintings I like,
knows my favorite music.

153
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,274
Same for anybody else
that's in the system.

154
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,068
There's a little sensor
that detects who's in the room.

155
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,071
Doesn't Bill Gates have
something like that?

156
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,991
Bill who? Heh.

157
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:36,577
No, no. His is primitive.

158
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:40,164
So I understand you're thinking of
doing a start up.

159
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:42,791
Yeah.

160
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,795
My friends and I have been planning
on doing a media delivery system
for a long time.

161
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,965
It would be open source, we'd...

162
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:53,468
offer it free for everybody,
just charge for tech support.

163
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,888
Wow, free.

164
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,765
This is a cut-throat business
we're in, Milo.

165
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,977
It's just a matter of time before
someone "borrows" your technology,

166
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,689
improves it and makes a
billion dollars on it.

167
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:09,693
What would you do with a
billion dollars, Milo?

168
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,278
I don't know.

169
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,863
I'll tell you what you could do.

170
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,991
You could take that money and
put it back into technology,

171
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,868
education and the arts.

172
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,786
You can transform culture.

173
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,499
I fund an opera company, symphony
orchestras, museums, theaters,

174
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:27,461
I have donated thousands of computers
to schools throughout the country.

175
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,379
The question really is,

176
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,299
how many of the people that you share
your discoveries with,

177
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,968
will be altruistic,

178
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,972
and how many will make fortunes
off of your generosity?

179
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:46,271
Come on in here.

180
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,571
Check this out.

181
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,992
- This is a SYNAPSE satellite.
- You bet.

182
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,996
I've got 240 of these up there.

183
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:06,291
12 different orbital patterns,
20 satellites.

184
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,293
The Mother satellite of each ring

185
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,671
passes over us
every night at 10 o'clock

186
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,091
to allow for station keeping,
re-programming, etc.

187
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,885
They in turn pass the data along
to the sister satellites in their ring.

188
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,763
- That's the coolest I've ever seen.
- I'm total wrapped up in this.

189
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,766
It's like I've got my own mission
control right here on my PC.

190
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:26,270
Activation codes,
IP addresses, flight path...

191
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:30,274
- It's the best train set ever, hum?
- You bet!

192
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,281
We've loaded a backdoor
to receive SYNAPSE transmissions

193
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:40,367
and all of our OS software
for the past 6 years.

194
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:44,371
We've developed compression
schemes and file formats that
achieve connectivity,

195
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:48,083
but..

196
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,461
We have a problem.

197
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,089
You know what that problem is?

198
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,093
Your adaptors can't overcome the
bandwidth limitations of
wireless hand-helds.

199
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:00,762
That's right.

200
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,974
Data takes too long to download
so your image gets...

201
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,185
Image, ah, goes fuzzy

202
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:10,189
Fuzzy, yeah. Heh.

203
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,277
Can you get this done in time
to meet your date?

204
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:19,281
With you, I can.

205
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,496
So I understand your friend Teddy is
kind of attached to his parents.

206
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:27,289
It's very commendable.

207
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,291
The truth is he's...

208
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,585
Milo, I know, he thinks we've...

209
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,170
cloned too many programs

210
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,590
an forced people to buy our inferior
versions and blah, blah, blah..

211
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,091
ad infinitum, ad nauseum

212
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,259
I've heard it all before.

213
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,385
I even understand it,

214
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,262
it's the nature of competitive business.

215
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,764
When you're on top,

216
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,099
people attack the quality
of your product.

217
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,185
It comes with the territory.

218
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:52,189
It's when the attacks get personal
the "Gary Winston is Satan" web sites,

219
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:56,693
digitizing my wife's face on
porn star bodies...

220
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:01,073
I don't like that.

221
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:03,575
You're one of maybe
20 programmers in the world

222
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:07,579
with the mastery it's going to
take to finish this thing.

223
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,375
We'd love for you to join us.

224
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:15,295
The future holds limitless
possibilities, Milo.

225
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,090
You decide what the future
holds for you.

226
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,885
Let me know.

227
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:25,681
You know I look at you and see
something I haven't seen in 20 years.

228
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,099
What?

229
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:31,061
I see me.

230
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:46,785
Alice.

231
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:54,376
Yeah.

232
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,173
So When is Brian coming for the TV?

233
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:03,177
I don't know.

234
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:08,390
I'm going to leave you two alone, O.K?

235
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,276
Why are you doing this?

236
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,360
Teddy, come on.

237
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,780
He can't hit his date without you,
can he?

238
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,159
Remember that lecture Ginnings gave?
About open source.

239
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,160
Yeah.

240
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,871
He said human knowledge
belongs to the world.

241
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:33,081
Like Shakespeare or Aspirin.

242
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,792
Teddy, I know you are disappointed,
I just feel like...

243
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,961
...this is the right thing
to do for now.

244
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,797
They were interested in you too.
Gary even mentioned you.

245
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,091
Yeah, well..
I'm not interested in them.

246
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,468
That's fine.

247
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:47,763
I got what's important to you.

248
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:51,183
This is important to me.

249
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:53,894
And I know your are going to
get your venture capital.

250
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,187
We did.

251
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,189
We had to settle for 850
because we lost you.

252
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,982
So, it will be enough.

253
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,986
It'll be enough because
they've got you.

254
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:06,198
We're both going to do
something great.

255
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:07,991
Sure.

256
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:11,995
I just thought we were
going to do it together.

257
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,682
Milo, this is Mr. Barton
from the...

258
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,559
Department of Justice.

259
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,477
- Sorry about the glass.
- No problem.

260
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:39,273
Don't worry, Milo.
I'm here as a friend.

261
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,359
I understand you signed up
with Gary Winston.

262
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:46,363
You know Milo, we're at
a great disadvantage with NURV.

263
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:50,367
I mean our experts are not
as smart as theirs.

264
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:54,288
The truth is we could do with a real
smart guy on our team

265
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:58,292
to help us pick our fights.

266
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,670
I'm going to take a real shot
in the dark here, OK?

267
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,965
I can offer you $42,000
a year and a Buick,

268
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,969
if you will change your mind
and join us.

269
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:13,182
I'm hoping you have a feeling that
that is the right thing to do

270
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,477
Well, I'm sure what you're doing
is important, Mr. Barton,

271
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:21,398
I just fell like this is...
kind of my time to make my mark.

272
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,693
Well, like I said,
it is a shot in the dark.

273
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:28,697
No, no, no, please, please.
Keep it.

274
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:31,867
If you see something up there
that rubs you the wrong way,

275
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:35,871
do the right thing.

276
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,699
What are they building?

277
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,494
Oh, That's...
Building number 21.

278
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,996
It's way behind schedule.
It's still off limits.

279
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,998
It's a digital broadcast base.

280
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:23,961
It's taking forever to get the
fiber optics linked in there.

281
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,800
This is the Daycare Center.

282
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,594
Gary has put a lot of money
in there.

283
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:35,472
And the people with kids are
not hot shot geeks or anything.

284
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,391
They're just the payroll clerks
or whatever.

285
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:41,395
- That's cool.
- I know, that's really cool.

286
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,859
The card is encoded.

287
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:49,862
It tells us who came through
the door, and when.

288
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:52,698
If you see a tailgater,
that's somebody coming on your swipe,

289
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:53,782
report him.

290
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:57,786
If you see someone wandering around
without ID, it is your duty to
challenge him.

291
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:01,665
I don't give a shit if you're
a stock option billionaire.

292
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:04,960
If you don't challenge,
I'll have your butt.

293
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,461
He seemed a little tense.

294
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:07,796
Oh, Shrot, yeah, yeah.

295
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,798
He gets his chain pulled a lot
by the geeks around here

296
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:13,760
'cause he is non-tech.
He's an ex-cop or whatever.

297
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:20,976
Whoa..

298
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:24,980
Lisa actually looked at you.

299
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:27,482
She has a heavy graphics background.

300
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:31,069
She's programming scalable user
interfaces for the SYNAPSE modules.

301
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,071
She's a smart girl.

302
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,490
Every geek has a thing for Lisa, but

303
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,159
she won't let anyone get near her.

304
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,577
I have a girlfriend.

305
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:39,995
What?

306
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:43,790
You got like a "girlfriend"?
Like a 3-dimensional girlfriend?

307
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,794
That's really rare around here.

308
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:51,882
So, welcome to the egg.

309
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,759
Everybody listen up.

310
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,177
Can I have your attention, please?

311
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:58,388
This is Milo.
Milo, this is everybody.

312
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,891
Hello, Milo.

313
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:03,560
This is Lori, Darren..

314
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,771
You'll get to know everybody,
I'm sure.

315
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:08,398
And this...

316
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:09,691
is your world.

317
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:13,695
- Your are now officially an egg man!
- Woo!

318
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,491
OK, so we've got a...

319
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:21,495
electronic copy of Gary's book with
complementary player. As well as...

320
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:26,083
an audio version
narrated by Gary of course.

321
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,168
A hand held digi, cell phone,

322
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,379
and the keys to your brand new car.

323
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:31,672
I guess that's it, man.

324
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:35,259
Your counselor will be by to
fill you in on the rest of the details.

325
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,469
- You're gonna love it here.
- Thank you. And thanks for...

326
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:41,473
My pleasure, man. Good luck.

327
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,065
Hey, Milo!

328
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,483
Just a little advice.

329
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,777
Don't get too close to Stinky.

330
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,279
Hysterical, Desi.

331
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,781
What do they do for a village idiot
when you're here?

332
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:01,368
Dude! What do they do with all the
air fresheners while you're here?

333
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:05,372
I don't know.

334
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,477
Busy?

335
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,897
No,

336
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:33,275
I'm actually waiting for my counselor
to come by and introduce himself.

337
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,985
Oh!

338
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:38,864
Hello Milo, I'm Gary.

339
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:39,573
OK.

340
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,659
Come on. Let me introduce you
to the rest of the team.

341
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,786
Hey, Stinky.
Oh, hi, Gary.

342
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,663
How's it going?

343
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,081
Hi Gary, how's it going.

344
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,792
Desi and Stinky are
working on compression.

345
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:54,379
Josh and Vancat are
writing protocol handlers.

346
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,966
This is Milo.
Milo is working...

347
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,469
on the all important adapter.

348
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:03,180
All right, Milo.

349
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,099
When I announced the launch date
for SYNAPSE,

350
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,977
it wasn't arbitrary,

351
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:12,773
but it wasn't based on
our progress either, as you know.

352
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:16,777
If we do not have a workable
version of SYNAPSE by then,

353
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:19,988
it's over folks.

354
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:23,367
And this is the glib but little
headline you'll be seeing...

355
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,994
throughout the world.

356
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,163
- Not going to happen, is it?
- No

357
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,665
- Is it?
- No

358
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:33,669
Not going to happen.

359
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:37,965
There are no constraints,
no boundaries.

360
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:39,800
Surprise me.

361
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,760
Challenge me.

362
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,179
Defy me.

363
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,682
Defy yourselves.

364
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:48,976
You have a choice.

365
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:52,896
You can be forgotten,
or you can be remembered

366
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:56,859
as one of the noble few
who made it.

367
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:02,489
Now's the time
to go way beyond your potential.

368
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,576
Now's the time
to dig down deep folks.

369
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:09,580
Now's the time
to show why you are the elite.

370
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,498
The chosen few.

371
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:14,168
The rare lights that give
this company

372
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,586
its uniqueness,

373
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:19,590
it's luminescence.

374
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,262
- Now's the time to shine!
- Yeah! Woo!

375
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:42,279
Corporate condo's are almost as
romantic as they sounded, so she...

376
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:45,282
she brought me here, and...

377
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:49,286
Well, I think it's...

378
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:53,373
I th...
What do you think?

379
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:57,377
Did I tell you he has never been
anybody's counselor before?

380
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,261
I did. I'm sorry.

381
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,680
I'm sorry,
the house is great.

382
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,892
- It's great and so are you.
- Yeah?

383
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:13,685
- Really?
- Really.

384
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:17,397
- Come on,  I love you
- You do?

385
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:21,360
Show me the bedroom.

386
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:28,200
Most of us who write software
achieve our greatest work
before age 30.

387
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:31,078
As I grow older I know how
important it is..

388
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:35,082
Are you going to keep working?

389
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,890
Hi, Gary.

390
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,059
In the middle of something?

391
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:58,063
- No.
- Check this out.

392
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:08,866
Huh?

393
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:10,075
Wow!

394
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,786
Who did this?
Josh or Vancat or what..

395
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,872
Somebody, yeah.
Think you can use it?

396
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:18,876
- Yeah, the compression is awesome.
- Look at that!

397
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:23,797
- Structure is perfect.
- Yeah.

398
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:26,091
Oh, god! Oh!

399
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,385
So much fun!
Love doing this!

400
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:32,389
The governor of Missouri has called
upon the president to declare a
state of emergency.

401
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:34,975
In local news, a tragic car accident

402
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:38,979
took the life of Portland area
computer software entrepreneur,
William Sudd,

403
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:42,774
a Computer Science graduate from
the MIT

404
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,484
and a genius in his field.

405
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:48,488
Sudd was found to have both
Prozac and alcohol in his car...

406
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:51,658
Milo?

407
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:55,662
Hi.

408
00:24:56,497 --> 00:24:59,082
- You're pretty famous around here.
- Yeah, but...

409
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:01,293
getting a bit of a teacher's pet rep.

410
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:02,961
I wouldn't worry about it

411
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:06,590
I mean you have to figure most
people around here were their
teachers' pets.

412
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,467
- Were you?
- We moved around a lot.

413
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:11,470
- I barely knew my teachers.
- Me too, I..

414
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,474
- What were you? An army brat or
something?
- Yes, something like that.

415
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:18,268
What do you have there?

416
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:21,688
I wanted to show you
the interface systems... for SYNAPSE.

417
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,398
OK, here.

418
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:27,361
- I'm Lisa by the way.
- Yeah, I know.

419
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,988
Hi, you've reached the offices of
Skullbocks.

420
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,281
Teddy and Larry are out right now.

421
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:34,868
Leave a message and we'll
call you back when you're out
and leave you one.

422
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:37,663
Hey Teddy, it's Milo.

423
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:41,583
Just calling 'cause it's been a while
and...

424
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,294
guess I'm kinda hoping
you're not still pissed at me.

425
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:46,296
- Hi
- Hey

426
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:50,175
- How's it going?
- OK, I guess.

427
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:54,179
- And Larry?
- Good, yeah.

428
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,973
So, you guys making progress?

429
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:58,267
Sorry, that's classified information,

430
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:00,978
we had to sign all those non-
disclosure forms. You know how it is.

431
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:03,272
Oh yeah, yeah,
me too, me too.

432
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:05,899
Still, work is not the only thing
to talk about is it?

433
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:09,570
Oh, of course not.

434
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,780
So, what've you been up too?

435
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,784
Working.

436
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:19,371
It's good to hear from you,

437
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:23,375
even though you are the enemy now.

438
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:27,963
Gary Winston's office, can you hold
please? Thank you.

439
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:29,381
Thank you so much for holding,

440
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:33,385
How can I help you?
Let me just check that for you.

441
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:37,598
The Department of Justice says that
if we acquire Netmail they will view
it as anti-competitive.

442
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:42,186
Why didn't you tell me this
before we decided to forego R&D?

443
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:45,189
Well, at the time, they indicated
that it wouldn't be a problem.

444
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:47,399
They have a bureaucratic
mindset Gary, they...

445
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:48,358
They do?

446
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:50,694
I count on you to solve problems,
whatever it takes.

447
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:52,279
Show me some kind of creativity!

448
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,572
Gary, we're talking about the law.

449
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:55,199
It's not like making software.

450
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:58,785
There are limits.

451
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,496
No limits!

452
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:02,873
Stop thinking like a lawyer
for a second

453
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:06,877
and show me some kind of creativity!

454
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:11,298
Yes, sir.

455
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:18,180
He'll have to get back to you

456
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,390
Gary Winston's office,
can you hold please?

457
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,685
You can go on in now, Milo.

458
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,979
Gary Winston's office.

459
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:28,190
Yes, he is in a conference right now.
Can I take a message?

460
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,399
Gary.

461
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:33,362
You wanted to see me?

462
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:37,366
Yeah.

463
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:41,787
Take a look.

464
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:51,380
This is amazing.
Who's doing all this?

465
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,882
What does that mean?

466
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:57,886
- What does that mean, huh?
- Nothing, I, I...

467
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,186
I'm sorry.

468
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:09,773
That wasn't meant for you.

469
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:12,860
The Justice Department is
driving me nuts.

470
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,863
They make everything strategic I do,
look sordid.

471
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:19,867
Every good chess player knows his
opponent's moves before he makes them.

472
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:22,161
Everyone in business tries to
get ahead.

473
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:24,580
I get there first,
I'm a bad guy.

474
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,373
What are we doing here?

475
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,167
Are we making chemical weapons?

476
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:29,668
Kiddy porn?

477
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:33,463
Are we strip mining?
No!

478
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:37,467
Why are they after me?

479
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:42,472
The software business
is binary.

480
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:46,768
You're a one or a zero.
Alive or dead.

481
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,862
- It scales, don't you think?
- Definitely, yes.

482
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:01,992
Here.

483
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:06,580
It's your copy.

484
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:18,759
I don't want to speak too soon,

485
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:22,763
but I think I cracked it, Larry.

486
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:29,394
I really think I cracked it.

487
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:47,871
Are you going to tell me
what's bothering you are not?

488
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:50,791
- Ok
- Ok.

489
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:53,293
Gary gave me a
new compression scheme today.

490
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:54,378
I said...

491
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:56,380
"Who's doing all this",
cause I was impressed.

492
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,466
I wanted to know where it was
coming from. Right?

493
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:02,970
He just lost it, like...
he shouted at me,

494
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,974
he had this look in his eyes, like I..

495
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:11,186
- How horrible!
- Yeah

496
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:13,564
- Well, where did it come from?
- I don't know.

497
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:15,983
That's what I've been asking myself.

498
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:19,862
I asked around. Nobody knows
anything about it.

499
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:23,365
You know? So does he have some genius
stowed away somewhere?

500
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:26,785
And if does, the why not
let him write SYNAPSE?

501
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:30,497
- I not saying if makes any sense...
- Hey! Honey.

502
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:34,293
Sesame Seeds.
Jesus.

503
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:38,297
Excuse me...
Could you take that away? Thank you.

504
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,383
- I'm so stupid.
- Hey!

505
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:43,260
Hey.

506
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,596
He is a genius. Don't forget.

507
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:49,600
If anybody other than you could
write this thing as quickly as
you're saying...

508
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:53,770
...wouldn't it maybe be him?
- Yes, yes, you are right,

509
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,773
The guy's a genius.
SYNAPSE is all he cares about,

510
00:30:56,773 --> 00:31:00,777
and I'm being over-sensitive
for a change.

511
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:04,781
To geniuses.

512
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:18,879
You know what?

513
00:31:18,879 --> 00:31:22,883
Sometimes it helps to get out of
here. Just for an hour or so.

514
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,680
Hey, Milo!

515
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,600
Brian!

516
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,186
Just dropped off my resume.
Nearly got in the door.

517
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:35,771
You're living up here now?

518
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:38,982
I'm systems administrator
at the local public access station,

519
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:42,986
where any whack job
with 100 bucks gets his own show.

520
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:47,199
God, does it suck!

521
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:49,284
Can you help me?

522
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:53,288
- Put it a word.
- I'll see what I can do. Yeah.

523
00:31:56,375 --> 00:32:00,379
- Well, I'm parked illegally.
- Ok.

524
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:06,385
They pushed up the schedule
on all the SYNAPSE applications.

525
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:08,095
How fast are you going?

526
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:10,097
There is no second place.

527
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:12,975
Plus every time I get jammed up,

528
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:15,185
- Gary comes up with something.
- Did...

529
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:18,188
- Gary give you a new design or
something?
- Yeah

530
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:21,066
I must have offended him,
'cause he...

531
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:24,069
He yelled at me.

532
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:28,073
People don't ever just,
hand you stuff.

533
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:32,369
Maybe once.
I reconfigured it anyway.

534
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,874
You're compulsive.

535
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:14,995
Moments,

536
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:17,372
precious moments
that you want to hold

537
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:18,999
that you want to share,

538
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:21,168
at home, at school, at work.

539
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:24,880
You'll keep in touch with the ones
you love through SYNAPSE.

540
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,175
The first satellite-delivered,
global communication system.

541
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:32,179
Share live voices, music,
pictures or video,

542
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:34,264
data or text,

543
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:36,683
with anyone, anywhere, instantly...

544
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:39,978
Look, Daddy.

545
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:43,565
SYNAPSE links every
communication devices on the planet.

546
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:47,569
Because every moment matters.

547
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:56,078
- I think I have a problem.
- I think you do.

548
00:33:56,078 --> 00:33:59,164
Hi, honey.

549
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:00,999
Hi.

550
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:04,962
I didn't expect.. ah..

551
00:34:05,963 --> 00:34:09,091
Lisa this is my...
this is Alice..

552
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:13,095
Lisa is doing the user interfaces
for SYNAPSE.

553
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:16,682
Hi

554
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:20,060
Milo tells me
you're a really great artist.

555
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:24,064
Oh? Well he exaggerates.

556
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:30,571
Well... I've got a lot to do...
It was nice to meet you.

557
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,871
How are you?
I'm so surprised.

558
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:41,999
- Are you Ok? Is everything alright?
- Yeah, yeah.

559
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:44,168
I've always wanted to come out, and...

560
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:45,794
you know... see what this place
is like.

561
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:49,798
- It's really good to see you.
- Yeah.

562
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:54,970
What did the girl say?

563
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:58,473
That he's maybe a little less stressed
after you snapped at him.

564
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:02,477
- It hasn't affected his work though.
- Nothing does.

565
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:06,773
It's pretty amazing.

566
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:19,661
What's wrong?

567
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:23,665
Teddy's been killed.

568
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,676
They've done this before. Just...

569
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:17,970
never killed anybody till now.

570
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,389
It's their writing on the wall.

571
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:24,059
Their hate literature was
scattered everywhere.

572
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:26,186
Their whole MO. It's like...

573
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:28,689
they were asking to be caught.

574
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:31,191
And they've been arrested twice
for beating up Asians.

575
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:33,068
How come they weren't in jail?

576
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:36,363
People told us to be careful
in this neighborhood.

577
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:38,782
I guess he didn't take them
too seriously.

578
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:41,869
Yeah. Well.
That's our problem.

579
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:45,372
We don't take anything seriously.
Do we?

580
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:49,376
It's not on the hard drive.

581
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:11,273
Hey, I didn't know you guys
were working with fiber optics.

582
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:34,087
What a bunch of crazy assholes.

583
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:38,759
And he was on the verge of something.
He was right there.

584
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:40,886
He was going to show us the next day.

585
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:44,890
He told me I should get the VC to
line up appointments with a
bunch of companies.

586
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:46,975
You know?

587
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:50,562
He said, the answer is not
in the box.

588
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:54,274
It's in the band.

589
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:57,986
You know I called him last week to...
'cause...

590
00:37:57,986 --> 00:38:01,990
I know.
He was happy you did.

591
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:11,375
Be strong, Larry.

592
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:15,462
Milo.

593
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:19,466
- May I join you?
- Yeah

594
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:26,765
Heard about what happened.

595
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:29,393
- I'm very sorry.
- Thanks

596
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:32,771
Had you talked to him... much,
lately?

597
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:34,773
Just once.

598
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:38,694
Things weren't that great between us
and we couldn't talk about work

599
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:42,698
'cause it was off limits.

600
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:44,992
Did you have something
you wanted to show me?

601
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,495
- We can save it for another day.
- No, it's okay. I..

602
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:50,664
It will help take my mind off things.

603
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:52,374
- Really?
- Yeah. yeah

604
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:55,961
Okay.

605
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:58,589
I haven't been able to sleep all week.

606
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:01,884
I'm thinking about the push mechanism
in the handler.

607
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:03,886
And then it just came to me.

608
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:05,596
It's in the wrong place.

609
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:09,099
- The wrong place?
- Yeah.

610
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:12,895
The answer is not in the box.

611
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:14,980
It's in the band.

612
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:18,984
"It's in the band."

613
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:32,789
The answer is not in the box.
It's in the band.

614
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:34,500
He was on the verge of something.

615
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,960
Well, where did it come from?

616
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,463
They're being investigated by the
Justice Department...

617
00:39:39,463 --> 00:39:43,300
They just want to own everything.

618
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,262
We are very close.

619
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,184
Hey, you sure you are all right?

620
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:56,188
I think I ate something,
I gotta go.

621
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:18,669
Alice!

622
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:29,972
Shhh..

623
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:34,059
Teddy was onto something very
specific, now he's dead.

624
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,894
There's got to be a connection,
Alice, I can feel it.

625
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:37,062
So what are you saying?

626
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:38,772
You think they had something
to do with Teddy's death?

627
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:39,773
I don't know what I am saying.

628
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:41,775
All I know is
all these ideas keep flying in.

629
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,986
He says any kid working in his garage
can put him out of business.

630
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:46,196
It's almost like they know
what ever kid is doing.

631
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:47,781
They're hacking into people's
computers?

632
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:50,492
I guess they could get into something
with machines. But not Teddy's.

633
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:53,871
He always had the most paranoid
firewalls to protect his data.

634
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:56,081
They'd have to have been like...

635
00:40:56,081 --> 00:41:00,085
watching him physically.

636
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:04,882
Oh. Shit!

637
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:15,893
I think it's part of a camera.

638
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:18,187
Number 21 isn't just a broadcast
studio.

639
00:41:18,187 --> 00:41:20,981
It's a surveillance post or something.
That's why they have those dishes
on the roof.

640
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:22,774
Milo, think about that you're saying.

641
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:24,568
You honestly think that
he would murder somebody?

642
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:25,986
I don't know,
I gotta get in there.

643
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:28,071
There's over 20 buildings over there,
and they're all filled with computers.

644
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:29,865
No, no, no. This is the only one
with dishes on the roof.

645
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:32,284
The studio's a front. That's why
they keep postponing the opening.

646
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:34,369
Ok, now you're scaring me.

647
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:35,579
Do you wanna just go?

648
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:38,081
'Cause we can go,
you wanna just... leave?

649
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:40,375
Go where Alice? You can't get away
from people like this.

650
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,377
People like this.
This is Gary you are talking about.

651
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:45,881
You don't think I know that?

652
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:48,091
They're under investigation
by the Justice Department.

653
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:50,761
I mean, you said yourself that there
are guys showing up all the time.

654
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:53,472
How could they possibly hope
on hiding a surveillance post?

655
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:55,766
How could they hope on hiding anything?

656
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:57,768
You can't get in there anyway.
They have swipe cards.

657
00:41:57,768 --> 00:41:59,978
They have cameras,
It's like Fort Knox for Christ's sake.

658
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:01,271
I'm implicated, I'm implicated Alice.

659
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:03,774
- No, you're not.
- Yes I am.

660
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:05,359
Who's been using this code, huh?

661
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,361
Teddy's code.
Whoever's code this is. I have.

662
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:09,488
How do you think that makes me feel?
This is my best friend,

663
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:10,572
You need to calm down, now.

664
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:14,576
- I can't just walk away from this.
- Yeah, but you just can't walk in
either.

665
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:21,583
- You're right.
- Yeah.

666
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:24,169
You're right.

667
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:26,672
The construction is finished by 6 or 7,

668
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:28,966
the parking lot is cleared
by 2 or 3 in the morning.

669
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:31,969
- Even the earliest geeks don't get in
till about 5.
- Honey, what are you talking about?

670
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:33,387
What, what are you saying right now?

671
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:34,763
I'm thinking about how I'm gonna
get in there,

672
00:42:34,763 --> 00:42:36,390
and find out what the hell is going on.

673
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,975
Ok, then. Was it true or wasn't it true?

674
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:41,186
Did you ever really notice?
'Cause you're sounding like a madman.

675
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:42,688
I won't pretend like
everything's okay, Alice.

676
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:46,692
It's how I got into this mess.

677
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:48,986
I..., that's how...

678
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:50,195
Alice listen, listen,

679
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:53,782
- I'm not mad at you, Listen to me.
- Don't.

680
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:56,285
I think I can figure out
a way to get in there.

681
00:42:56,285 --> 00:43:00,289
But I can't do it on my own.
So I need you to help me.

682
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:05,460
What do I do ?

683
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,297
So you believe me?

684
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:12,259
Just tell me what to do.

685
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:55,260
Whoa, whoa , whoa, whoa. Sir, you've got
to use your own. Where's your ID?

686
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:02,976
I caught him tailgating. Building 20.

687
00:44:13,362 --> 00:44:17,366
These cards are your own responsibility.

688
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:33,382
- There was an explosion in a closet
in building 12.
- What?

689
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:39,263
Hey, you can't wander around without ID.
Just park your ass in that chair.

690
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:37,881
Well, what can I tell ya?
It's a pretty basic operation.

691
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:41,760
You got your time clock. Fuse goes
in here. You just hook it in the
switch over here...

692
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,262
So, what do we have here Bob?

693
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:46,265
A glorified cherry bomb.
Some geek's idea of fun.

694
00:46:46,265 --> 00:46:48,183
I've been saying
we need a camera in this hall.

695
00:46:48,183 --> 00:46:50,686
To protect what?
The mops?

696
00:46:50,686 --> 00:46:52,271
Somebody's pulling your chain again, Bob.

697
00:46:52,271 --> 00:46:55,065
Unless it's a diversion.
Milo Hoffmann is in my office.

698
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:58,861
- He was tailgating, and I...
- Bob. Milo's not just another geek.

699
00:46:58,861 --> 00:47:02,865
He is very important to Gary.
So let's not go there, all right?

700
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:07,870
Okay. We'll see you later.

701
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:56,793
Is everything okay, Bob?

702
00:48:10,766 --> 00:48:14,770
- Hey
- Hi, Gary.

703
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:18,774
- Working kinda late. huh?
- Yeah , uh...

704
00:48:18,774 --> 00:48:22,778
- Can I take a look ?
- Yeah.

705
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:29,368
- That's nice. That's excellent.
- Thanks.

706
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:32,287
You seem kinda jumpy, Milo.

707
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:34,498
No. I'm just a....

708
00:48:34,498 --> 00:48:37,459
I'm a little surprised to see you.
Out here, now.

709
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:40,087
Well, I like to sneak in
late at night sometimes

710
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:44,091
to see who the obsessive ones are.

711
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:49,680
Don't work too late.

712
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,684
I got my eye on you.

713
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:47,488
- How's it going?
- Big night.

714
00:49:47,488 --> 00:49:50,282
Switched from tea to coffee.

715
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:54,286
Brought new meaning to my work.

716
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:29,882
Well. Now he knows.
Nothing in there.

717
00:51:29,965 --> 00:51:33,677
- Maybe he'll get back to work now.
- Yeah. Copy that.

718
00:51:33,677 --> 00:51:37,681
- Speaking of which...
- Okay. I'm on my way back.

719
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,084
- Did you download Callier in San Jose.
- Oh shit.

720
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:54,878
I'll do it.

721
00:54:54,878 --> 00:54:58,882
- Shame we can't walk in the front door.
- Yeah, wouldn't Bob love that?

722
00:59:20,477 --> 00:59:24,481
Ooh!

723
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:29,486
Jesus!

724
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,674
I need a thorough background check.

725
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:57,467
I want to know every organization

726
01:01:57,467 --> 01:02:00,179
he's been involved with.
All church groups, all...

727
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:01,889
- Mr. Barton?
- Yes

728
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:04,099
Excuse me...

729
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:05,893
Do you remember me?

730
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:06,894
Meelo, isn't it?

731
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:08,270
Milo

732
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:10,481
I really need to talk to you sir...

733
01:02:10,481 --> 01:02:13,192
Right. Give me a few seconds
with Lacy here.

734
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:17,196
You can go in my office.
I won't be a moment.

735
01:02:22,576 --> 01:02:26,580
Send him the facts as soon as possible.
I don't want to surprise him.

736
01:02:43,388 --> 01:02:47,392
Milo.

737
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:49,394
Thank you for seeing me, sir.

738
01:02:49,394 --> 01:02:53,398
- No problem, have a seat.
- I'm OK.

739
01:02:55,067 --> 01:02:58,987
- You look a little upset.
- I am sir, I am.

740
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:00,280
What's the problem, son?

741
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:04,284
Ah.. well...

742
01:03:04,576 --> 01:03:08,580
My friend, my best friend Teddy,

743
01:03:08,664 --> 01:03:12,292
he was killed in Silicon Valley and I..

744
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:15,087
I thought maybe there is some way
I could help them find the suspects.

745
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:17,297
- You mean Teddy Chan?
- Yes, sir.

746
01:03:17,297 --> 01:03:21,260
Well, I guess you didn't see
the 11 o'clock news last night.

747
01:03:21,677 --> 01:03:25,472
San Jose police picked up the suspects
and they're holding them without bail.

748
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:28,475
That's great. That's...

749
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:32,479
I hope I'll sleep better, tonight.

750
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:38,360
I'm... a little disappointed.

751
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,864
I thought that you decided to
join our side.

752
01:03:41,864 --> 01:03:45,868
No sir, no. I'm...
I'm real happy there at NURV.

753
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:49,580
But....

754
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:53,584
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.

755
01:03:53,876 --> 01:03:57,588
- So he didn't mention he was going to
the Justice Department?
- No.

756
01:03:57,588 --> 01:03:59,381
You're not losing your hold on him,
are you, Rebecca?

757
01:03:59,381 --> 01:04:02,759
Don't forget your part of the deal.
You've got a very good thing going here.

758
01:04:02,759 --> 01:04:04,761
Phil, he'll tell me when he gets back.

759
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:06,763
Well, that will be the test.
Won't it?

760
01:04:06,763 --> 01:04:09,099
Yeah.

761
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:13,061
Prick!

762
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:28,494
It's 10 o'clock,
I've been so worried about you

763
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:30,662
What did you see in there?

764
01:04:30,662 --> 01:04:34,500
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

765
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,585
It's exactly what they said it is.

766
01:04:36,585 --> 01:04:40,589
An unfinished broadcast studio.

767
01:04:42,591 --> 01:04:45,594
You know, I think I've been
putting my own guilt on Gary.

768
01:04:45,594 --> 01:04:47,262
Guilt?

769
01:04:47,262 --> 01:04:51,266
Yeah. If I'd done the start up,
maybe Teddy would still be alive.

770
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:54,478
Or maybe you'd be dead too.

771
01:04:54,478 --> 01:04:57,564
Anyway, I figured, instead of indulging
in all these paranoid delusions

772
01:04:57,564 --> 01:05:01,568
and scaring you, I should do something
useful with my grief.

773
01:05:02,486 --> 01:05:06,490
So I went to see that guy Barton
at the DOJ, remember him?

774
01:05:07,866 --> 01:05:09,159
Yeah.

775
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:11,495
I wanted to see if I could help him
find Teddy's killers

776
01:05:11,495 --> 01:05:15,499
and it turns out that
they got the guys last night, so...

777
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:19,878
I have been so worried about you.

778
01:05:19,878 --> 01:05:22,172
You were right
to let him break into 21.

779
01:05:22,172 --> 01:05:24,591
He felt pretty foolish afterwards.

780
01:05:24,591 --> 01:05:27,970
He said it was all to do
with his own guilt, you know.

781
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,973
Not being there.
Not doing the start up.

782
01:05:30,973 --> 01:05:32,891
I mean, his best friend was just killed.

783
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:36,895
You're convinced he is completely focused
on SYNAPSE again.

784
01:05:36,895 --> 01:05:39,273
- He's not acting?
- No

785
01:05:39,273 --> 01:05:41,984
He's pretty honest with his feelings.

786
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:45,988
I don't think he knows how to act.
All right?

787
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:48,991
Good.
That's all for now.

788
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:50,576
Lisa, I had to tell someone.

789
01:05:50,576 --> 01:05:52,578
They know everything
about everybody.

790
01:05:52,578 --> 01:05:54,788
There're stealing code
from all over the place.

791
01:05:54,788 --> 01:05:57,583
And sometimes, if someone gets ahead
of them, like Teddy...

792
01:05:57,583 --> 01:05:59,168
- And it's all undetectable.
- What?

793
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:02,296
The crimes are hand-tailored. These
guys are in the information business.

794
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:04,798
If it's a Chinese guy, frame the
local racist.

795
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:07,593
Plus, I'm sure Gary has
maximum deniability.

796
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:08,677
He tells his people,

797
01:06:08,677 --> 01:06:10,679
surprise me, solve the problem,
defy me.

798
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:12,681
They turn around and
tell the next person the same things.

799
01:06:12,681 --> 01:06:15,184
That sounds crazy. Why would he put
himself on the line like that?

800
01:06:15,184 --> 01:06:16,560
SYNAPSE...

801
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,061
The guy has invested billions
on getting there first.

802
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:20,898
He'll do anything to get his date.
He has to.

803
01:06:20,898 --> 01:06:23,066
Lisa...

804
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:25,694
They killed my best friend.

805
01:06:25,694 --> 01:06:27,070
Maybe others.

806
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:29,364
I'm living with someone
that they paid to sleep with me.

807
01:06:29,364 --> 01:06:32,284
- We have to do something.
- Like what? What could we possibly do?

808
01:06:32,284 --> 01:06:34,786
I don't know yet.
But we are one step ahead of them.

809
01:06:34,786 --> 01:06:37,164
They don't know I've been in the
Daycare Center. Just 21.

810
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:41,168
They let me do that.
That's all they know, though.

811
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:48,592
Lisa...

812
01:06:49,384 --> 01:06:50,260
Lisa!

813
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,679
I'm sorry, Milo.

814
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:56,683
All right? I'm sorry.

815
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:08,987
Lisa, I know why
you won't let anybody near you.

816
01:07:17,871 --> 01:07:21,875
I know what he did to you.

817
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:29,883
If you leave now,
you could be in danger.

818
01:07:29,883 --> 01:07:31,385
They would use my step father?

819
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:35,389
They could frame him
if they had too, yeah.

820
01:07:45,983 --> 01:07:47,192
What about the FBI?

821
01:07:47,192 --> 01:07:48,777
Too risky.

822
01:07:48,777 --> 01:07:52,781
I went to the DOJ, but they got a guy
on payroll over there. Maybe others.

823
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:56,076
Who knows who they're paying?

824
01:07:56,076 --> 01:07:57,369
Well, who can we trust?

825
01:07:57,369 --> 01:08:00,873
I mean how do you let go of a secret
without telling the wrong person?

826
01:08:00,873 --> 01:08:04,877
I don't know.

827
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:08,797
We tell everybody at once!

828
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:10,883
See, that way there is no secret
left to protect.

829
01:08:10,883 --> 01:08:13,385
If everybody knows,
they can't touch us.

830
01:08:13,385 --> 01:08:17,389
Right?

831
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:23,061
What about 60 minutes?

832
01:08:25,898 --> 01:08:28,358
CBS news has partnered
with NURV Information Systems

833
01:08:28,358 --> 01:08:32,362
in a cable news network
due to launch Fall of 2001.

834
01:08:33,489 --> 01:08:37,493
AOL-Time Warner has a 40% stake in
Gary's setup device.
That also takes out CNN.

835
01:08:39,786 --> 01:08:43,165
Disney joins NURV in new venture.
ABC is out.

836
01:08:43,165 --> 01:08:47,169
Look, any of these places
could a mole. Or all of them.

837
01:08:49,588 --> 01:08:51,173
- Wait
- What?

838
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:53,967
How close are you to finishing
SYNAPSE?

839
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:56,470
He's got all the satellites up.

840
01:08:56,470 --> 01:09:00,474
There are dishes on top of 21.  He's
building this mega network
just for SYNAPSE.

841
01:09:01,391 --> 01:09:04,478
We can connect to everybody
on every device simultaneously.

842
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:07,981
That's what SYNAPSE is.

843
01:09:07,981 --> 01:09:11,068
That's what we'll use.

844
01:09:11,068 --> 01:09:15,072
Got him.

845
01:09:17,282 --> 01:09:21,161
So what's in the Daycare Center is
a ton of raw material, and it's
all over the place.

846
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:23,872
What I need you to do is
design some kind of a graphic format

847
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:25,791
so people can following
what there're seeing.

848
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:27,167
No problem.

849
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:30,087
- Shit
- What?

850
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:32,798
I'd have to get into Gary's house
to get the satellite addresses.

851
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:35,175
He's running the whole thing
from his work room.

852
01:09:35,175 --> 01:09:36,760
You mean break in?

853
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,595
I don't know,
I don't know...

854
01:09:38,595 --> 01:09:41,098
And what if the dishes
on top of 21 aren't hot yet?

855
01:09:41,098 --> 01:09:43,976
The place isn't even finished.

856
01:09:43,976 --> 01:09:46,562
I'll go up.

857
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:50,566
You're not afraid?

858
01:09:56,572 --> 01:09:59,491
Testing...

859
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:00,784
UPLINK ACTIVE.

860
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:02,369
Welcome back to Good Morning Portland.

861
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:05,581
This Thursday,
50 of Portland's elite couples

862
01:10:05,581 --> 01:10:09,168
will attend a gala party at the home
of Gary and Clarissa Winston.

863
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:11,587
to raise money
for the Portland Art museum.

864
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:13,380
Julie is at the museum.

865
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:17,092
Last year partygoers pledged over
2 million dollars to this museum.

866
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:18,969
- Look at this.
- What?

867
01:10:18,969 --> 01:10:22,598
Why doesn't he invite us to his party?
He's never even met you.

868
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:24,683
Milo, he has thousands of employees.

869
01:10:24,683 --> 01:10:25,767
I know Alice.

870
01:10:25,767 --> 01:10:28,270
But this is for the art museum,
and you're an artist.

871
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:32,274
- If anybody should be invited,
you should.
- Ah, hum.

872
01:10:34,193 --> 01:10:36,487
This is not live feed.

873
01:10:36,487 --> 01:10:40,073
This is playback from some other day.
It's been messed with.

874
01:10:40,073 --> 01:10:43,076
- Do we call Randy and Phil?
- Not yet.

875
01:10:43,076 --> 01:10:47,080
I'll have to bust my ass
'cause I'm not a friggin' mensa.

876
01:10:47,289 --> 01:10:51,084
I swear to God it's that kid Milo.

877
01:10:51,084 --> 01:10:55,088
Let's run a check on card entries.
Go back two weeks.

878
01:10:58,175 --> 01:11:00,093
Skullbocks, Larry speaking.

879
01:11:00,093 --> 01:11:01,970
Hey Larry, it's Milo.

880
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:02,971
Hey buddy.

881
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:06,975
- How's it going?
- I'm good.

882
01:11:07,184 --> 01:11:08,894
I'm... back in the garage.

883
01:11:08,894 --> 01:11:11,980
Didn't want to stay at that other place.

884
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:15,776
What's up?

885
01:11:15,776 --> 01:11:17,778
Milo?

886
01:11:17,778 --> 01:11:20,572
You there?

887
01:11:20,572 --> 01:11:22,574
Larry, you got a second?

888
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:24,868
I might need your help with something.

889
01:11:24,868 --> 01:11:28,872
You bet man, name it.

890
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:35,587
Milo.

891
01:11:35,587 --> 01:11:39,383
Giving a benefit for the art museum
Thursday night. Thought you'd like
to bring Alice.

892
01:11:39,383 --> 01:11:40,759
That's great. Thank you.

893
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:44,763
Sorry about the late notice.

894
01:12:08,662 --> 01:12:11,290
You went into 21 twice
without coming out.

895
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:13,375
You came out twice
without going back in.

896
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:14,960
Who are you?
Harry Houdini?

897
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,380
No, No, No. This things is screwed up.
Look.

898
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:20,465
It's also got me going
into Daycare that night.

899
01:12:20,465 --> 01:12:22,259
Daycare Center is not in your tour.

900
01:12:22,259 --> 01:12:26,263
Exactly, I've never been in there.

901
01:12:27,973 --> 01:12:31,268
- Milo, we're late.
- I'm coming. I just gotta get...

902
01:12:31,268 --> 01:12:35,272
find some scissors for this...

903
01:14:08,365 --> 01:14:12,369
He called the house.
Asked if we have enough space.

904
01:14:23,463 --> 01:14:25,883
- Alice I'm Gary.
- Hi.

905
01:14:25,883 --> 01:14:26,884
This is my wife Clarissa.

906
01:14:26,884 --> 01:14:29,094
So, this is Alice. Hello.

907
01:14:29,094 --> 01:14:30,888
- Gary tells me you are an artist.
- Yes, I am.

908
01:14:30,888 --> 01:14:34,475
Milo, this is Barry Linder.
He's visiting us from Hollywood.

909
01:14:34,475 --> 01:14:36,685
Barry's studio is going to
help us fill the...

910
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:38,896
...SYNAPSE pipeline.
- Oh, great.

911
01:14:38,896 --> 01:14:41,398
The marketing implications are epic.

912
01:14:41,398 --> 01:14:43,192
A kid is watching a movie,

913
01:14:43,192 --> 01:14:45,569
points and clicks
at the laser blaster

914
01:14:45,569 --> 01:14:49,490
and before the reel is even over,
he's bought the toy.

915
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:52,075
So it's just to hell with story,
and how many toys can you sell?

916
01:14:52,075 --> 01:14:53,869
He, he.

917
01:14:53,869 --> 01:14:56,580
- What about the artist?
- Artist?

918
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:58,790
The only art left in America
is business,

919
01:14:58,790 --> 01:15:01,877
and you're standing
in Da Vinci's house.

920
01:15:01,877 --> 01:15:03,670
Excuse me, where is the bathroom?

921
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:07,674
- It's just around the corner.
- Thank you.

922
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:42,788
You left the party to work?

923
01:17:42,788 --> 01:17:46,291
I got inspired.

924
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:50,295
I didn't want to forget it,
so I came here to write it down.

925
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:54,675
I'm sorry if I was rude.

926
01:18:01,265 --> 01:18:05,269
I know what you're doing, Milo.

927
01:18:06,061 --> 01:18:10,065
I just want to know
that it isn't affecting your work.

928
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:12,359
I don't know what you mean.

929
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:15,195
Milo, I'm not blind.

930
01:18:15,195 --> 01:18:17,865
Lisa is very attractive young woman.

931
01:18:17,865 --> 01:18:19,575
God knows.

932
01:18:19,575 --> 01:18:22,161
Your private life is your own.

933
01:18:22,161 --> 01:18:24,788
But we are very close
to our launch date.

934
01:18:24,788 --> 01:18:28,375
and I need you to keep
your eye on the ball.

935
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:31,962
- I understand, Gary.
- Good.

936
01:18:31,962 --> 01:18:35,966
Let's go have a drink.

937
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:46,894
Get the back slash, get the colon.

938
01:18:46,894 --> 01:18:49,897
Keys kids don't use but geeks do.

939
01:18:49,897 --> 01:18:51,482
What would Milo want in here anyway?

940
01:18:51,482 --> 01:18:53,984
They know.
Just don't trust me with it

941
01:18:53,984 --> 01:18:56,195
So we will get
the evidence first,

942
01:18:56,195 --> 01:18:57,488
ask questions later.

943
01:18:57,488 --> 01:19:01,492
You can get started on that one.

944
01:19:12,169 --> 01:19:13,879
What if he knows what we are doing.

945
01:19:13,879 --> 01:19:15,088
Do you think he's toying with us?

946
01:19:15,088 --> 01:19:17,299
How much time do you need?
Two days.

947
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:19,676
Now did you write the code
to sequence the video files?

948
01:19:19,676 --> 01:19:21,762
Yes, and the audio is done.

949
01:19:21,762 --> 01:19:25,766
The text file will feed
your voice synthesizer.

950
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:31,980
Hey, you're back.

951
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:33,774
I bought a hu-nin cookbook.

952
01:19:33,774 --> 01:19:37,194
'Cause we're always afraid for you
to eat in Chinese restaurants.

953
01:19:37,194 --> 01:19:40,489
I've been mincing and chopping
things into

954
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:43,867
teeny weeny pieces all afternoon.

955
01:19:43,867 --> 01:19:47,871
- But you never cook.
- I know.

956
01:19:49,998 --> 01:19:53,961
I'm gonna go change.

957
01:21:10,787 --> 01:21:12,498
Uh, uh...

958
01:21:12,498 --> 01:21:16,460
No escaping.

959
01:21:17,377 --> 01:21:21,381
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

960
01:21:31,892 --> 01:21:35,687
Milo?

961
01:21:35,687 --> 01:21:38,273
I'm going to go upstairs and
get changed.

962
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:41,568
I love the way you look.

963
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:45,572
Thanks.

964
01:21:48,575 --> 01:21:50,994
Hey, do we have any chopsticks?

965
01:21:50,994 --> 01:21:54,998
Yeah.

966
01:22:29,992 --> 01:22:33,871
Great.

967
01:22:33,871 --> 01:22:36,081
Wait...

968
01:22:36,081 --> 01:22:40,085
Right. A toast.

969
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:54,975
To a long life.

970
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:47,986
- Is it good?
- It's delicious.

971
01:23:47,986 --> 01:23:50,697
Yeah.

972
01:23:50,697 --> 01:23:53,200
There's something I need to tell you.

973
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:57,162
What?

974
01:23:59,998 --> 01:24:03,961
I love you.

975
01:24:11,969 --> 01:24:15,973
- Rebecca?
- Yeah?

976
01:24:34,283 --> 01:24:37,786
Come on... come on. Come on.

977
01:24:37,786 --> 01:24:40,164
See?

978
01:24:40,164 --> 01:24:44,168
Who needs computers?

979
01:24:49,089 --> 01:24:53,093
Gary, believe me,
I'm looking at his prints right now.

980
01:24:54,595 --> 01:24:57,681
You want Phil to handle it.

981
01:24:57,681 --> 01:24:59,892
Whatever you say.

982
01:24:59,892 --> 01:25:03,896
Bastards!

983
01:26:05,791 --> 01:26:06,959
Oh no.

984
01:26:06,959 --> 01:26:10,963
You don't get by me twice, kid.

985
01:26:12,172 --> 01:26:16,176
- You gonna call Gary?
- Screw Gary.

986
01:26:38,866 --> 01:26:42,870
Bob, these guys are criminals.

987
01:26:43,996 --> 01:26:45,789
Now, I am gonna go out on a limb
here because

988
01:26:45,789 --> 01:26:49,793
there's a good chance you're not
going to believe a word of what
I'm about to tell you.

989
01:26:53,589 --> 01:26:57,593
You'd be surprised about what
I believe about these people.

990
01:26:58,594 --> 01:27:02,598
Show me what you've got there.

991
01:27:27,581 --> 01:27:29,374
- Milo?
- Get your laptop. We're going tonight.

992
01:27:29,374 --> 01:27:30,959
You said two days!

993
01:27:30,959 --> 01:27:34,963
So, I'm a genius.

994
01:27:40,177 --> 01:27:41,887
- We're not ready. You said two days
- Yes we are.

995
01:27:41,887 --> 01:27:44,598
Lisa, you gotta trust me, Okay?

996
01:27:44,598 --> 01:27:47,768
I need you to trust me.

997
01:27:47,768 --> 01:27:51,688
Okay

998
01:27:51,688 --> 01:27:53,690
All right.

999
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:57,694
He left campus. He's taken some
surveillance data with him.

1000
01:27:59,196 --> 01:28:00,364
Don't worry,

1001
01:28:00,364 --> 01:28:04,368
we know where he is.

1002
01:28:34,982 --> 01:28:37,192
Is Brian here?
Brian Bissel.

1003
01:28:37,192 --> 01:28:41,196
Who wants to see him?

1004
01:28:45,159 --> 01:28:47,494
What's going on here?
You sounded insane on the phone.

1005
01:28:47,494 --> 01:28:49,580
We need to do a live broadcast,
right now.

1006
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:51,790
You can't pre-empt yoga
that's our biggest show.

1007
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:53,667
Brian, you want to be
a big deal in life, right?

1008
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:56,170
That's your dream, isn't it?

1009
01:28:56,170 --> 01:28:57,462
Will it mean
I get to work for NURV?

1010
01:28:57,462 --> 01:28:58,589
After this,
there won't be a NURV.

1011
01:28:58,589 --> 01:29:00,174
We're going to bring him down
and you're going to help us.

1012
01:29:00,174 --> 01:29:01,967
- That the most insane thing...
- Come on, man...

1013
01:29:01,967 --> 01:29:05,971
What have they ever done for you?

1014
01:29:06,597 --> 01:29:09,099
- Okay.
- Great.

1015
01:29:09,099 --> 01:29:10,684
Do you want to be a part of history?

1016
01:29:10,684 --> 01:29:12,394
Not really.

1017
01:29:12,394 --> 01:29:15,981
All right. How about...

1018
01:29:15,981 --> 01:29:19,985
...$132?

1019
01:29:27,493 --> 01:29:30,287
Fold your hands behind your back.

1020
01:29:30,287 --> 01:29:34,291
Lift the sternum bone, lift the arms,
through the hip...

1021
01:29:36,877 --> 01:29:40,881
...slowly.

1022
01:29:53,393 --> 01:29:56,396
- You're interfaced with the dish.
- OK.

1023
01:29:56,396 --> 01:30:00,359
Read me these IP addresses
starting with number one.. Wait.

1024
01:30:01,193 --> 01:30:02,361
Phil, come over here.

1025
01:30:02,361 --> 01:30:05,197
It's almost 10 oclock. We're going
to shutdown the mother satellites.

1026
01:30:05,197 --> 01:30:07,866
- What?
- Read me the IP addresses,
starting with 1.

1027
01:30:07,866 --> 01:30:10,577
- Gary...
- Just do it, Phil!

1028
01:30:10,577 --> 01:30:14,581
It's gone way too far already.

1029
01:30:22,089 --> 01:30:23,465
- Go!
- Go!

1030
01:30:23,465 --> 01:30:24,883
- 10
- 10

1031
01:30:24,883 --> 01:30:25,968
24

1032
01:30:25,968 --> 01:30:27,469
53

1033
01:30:27,469 --> 01:30:31,473
- 192
- 192

1034
01:30:38,188 --> 01:30:42,192
Come on, come on..
Come on, come on..

1035
01:30:52,161 --> 01:30:54,496
- It's your software?
- Is it your dish?

1036
01:30:54,496 --> 01:30:56,582
All right. Number 2.
Go.

1037
01:30:56,582 --> 01:30:58,584
Give me number 2.

1038
01:30:58,584 --> 01:31:00,460
Milo, some weird-looking guys
just pulled in.

1039
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:03,672
Brian, don't worry about it.
Just give me number 2.

1040
01:31:03,672 --> 01:31:04,673
10

1041
01:31:04,673 --> 01:31:05,466
43

1042
01:31:05,466 --> 01:31:06,175
84

1043
01:31:06,175 --> 01:31:10,179
143

1044
01:31:15,392 --> 01:31:19,396
Come on, come on..

1045
01:31:20,898 --> 01:31:24,860
Damn it!

1046
01:31:30,073 --> 01:31:32,576
Okay, Get out of the there!

1047
01:31:32,576 --> 01:31:34,661
- Checked your connection?
- Yes

1048
01:31:34,661 --> 01:31:36,497
- He knows!
- What?

1049
01:31:36,497 --> 01:31:38,081
He's shutting down
the satellites one step ahead.

1050
01:31:38,081 --> 01:31:40,876
Go to the end.
Give me number 12.

1051
01:31:40,876 --> 01:31:44,797
- 42
- Wait.

1052
01:31:44,797 --> 01:31:46,089
He knows I am shutting them down.

1053
01:31:46,089 --> 01:31:49,259
- What?
- I know how his mind works.

1054
01:31:49,259 --> 01:31:50,969
Give me the last one, Number 12.

1055
01:31:50,969 --> 01:31:54,973
- Gary?
- Just do it!

1056
01:31:55,766 --> 01:31:59,770
Ah, give me number 5.

1057
01:31:59,895 --> 01:32:01,772
48, 29

1058
01:32:01,772 --> 01:32:03,398
- Hurry up, hurry up
- 230

1059
01:32:03,398 --> 01:32:05,192
Open the door Milo!

1060
01:32:05,192 --> 01:32:09,196
One more second.

1061
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:19,164
Guys, we're okay.
I've got it under control.

1062
01:32:22,668 --> 01:32:26,672
Give us the disk Milo,
come on!

1063
01:32:27,297 --> 01:32:31,260
The disk, Milo, now.
Come on, it's over.

1064
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:55,075
...reaching a calm, peaceful place...

1065
01:32:57,786 --> 01:33:01,790
Hey, hey, asshole!

1066
01:33:40,787 --> 01:33:44,583
What's with the Mission Impossible 3,
bullshit, Milo?

1067
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:48,587
You're a geek!

1068
01:33:49,671 --> 01:33:52,090
Excellent!

1069
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:54,968
They'll be back here in five minutes
with Milo and the disk.

1070
01:33:54,968 --> 01:33:56,970
Good.

1071
01:33:56,970 --> 01:34:00,974
What do you want to do with him?

1072
01:34:01,683 --> 01:34:05,687
Surprise me.

1073
01:34:07,773 --> 01:34:11,777
Ok, Mr. Shrot,
I need the disk that Milo gave you.

1074
01:34:14,571 --> 01:34:17,282
You got something non-geeky
that I could do?

1075
01:34:17,282 --> 01:34:21,286
- Yeah, we're gonna need a TV set
in here.
- You got it.

1076
01:34:42,182 --> 01:34:44,893
So what are you typing
in there, Larry?

1077
01:34:44,893 --> 01:34:48,188
IP addresses, it's like
calling up a satellite on the phone.

1078
01:34:48,188 --> 01:34:52,192
The first two haven't picked up.
Come on pick up man.

1079
01:35:04,663 --> 01:35:06,582
Thank you.

1080
01:35:06,582 --> 01:35:08,375
And thank you.

1081
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:11,879
You have achieved a miraculous thing.

1082
01:35:11,879 --> 01:35:13,881
I'm so proud of you.

1083
01:35:13,881 --> 01:35:14,882
Forgive me my methods but,

1084
01:35:14,882 --> 01:35:18,886
when you got off course, we had to
motivate you to keep working on SYNAPSE.

1085
01:35:19,761 --> 01:35:21,889
Without Lisa here urging you on,

1086
01:35:21,889 --> 01:35:23,265
we might not have made it.

1087
01:35:23,265 --> 01:35:24,391
It's true, Milo.

1088
01:35:24,391 --> 01:35:28,395
What we have done is so important.

1089
01:35:30,481 --> 01:35:33,567
Oh my god.
What?

1090
01:35:33,567 --> 01:35:37,571
Oh my god.

1091
01:35:41,992 --> 01:35:45,996
Gary!

1092
01:36:16,568 --> 01:36:19,863
Who's got SYNAPSE, Milo?

1093
01:36:19,863 --> 01:36:23,867
Does this mean we did it?
Does this mean we did it?

1094
01:36:25,869 --> 01:36:27,496
Yeah, man!

1095
01:36:27,496 --> 01:36:29,665
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Fantastic!!

1096
01:36:29,665 --> 01:36:31,792
Yeah, your Jim Broker
never saw us coming,

1097
01:36:31,792 --> 01:36:33,377
were coming!

1098
01:36:33,377 --> 01:36:35,671
Consumers don't care where
new ideas come from,

1099
01:36:35,671 --> 01:36:38,799
just so long as they're offered
a competitive price.

1100
01:36:38,799 --> 01:36:40,259
The Software business is binary.

1101
01:36:40,259 --> 01:36:44,263
You're a one or a zero.
Alive or dead.

1102
01:36:46,765 --> 01:36:49,893
We do have a monopoly here,
we do have a monopoly here,

1103
01:36:49,893 --> 01:36:53,897
Those who don't innovate are
doomed to die... doomed to die.

1104
01:36:56,567 --> 01:36:59,486
There is no second place.

1105
01:36:59,486 --> 01:37:02,698
SYNAPSE will fully unite
the global village.

1106
01:37:02,698 --> 01:37:06,577
New ideas are ready to be
devoured, re-defined.

1107
01:37:06,577 --> 01:37:07,870
This business is binary,

1108
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:11,165
either a one or a zero...

1109
01:37:11,165 --> 01:37:15,169
Alive or dead...

1110
01:37:16,587 --> 01:37:18,464
We're surrounded by predators.

1111
01:37:18,464 --> 01:37:21,467
Those who don't innovate

1112
01:37:21,467 --> 01:37:25,262
are doomed to die.
There is no second place.

1113
01:37:25,262 --> 01:37:29,266
Consumers don't care where
new ideas come from

1114
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:31,894
Just so long as they are offered
a competitive price

1115
01:37:31,894 --> 01:37:34,480
Any kid, anywhere in the world

1116
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:37,065
with a good idea,
can put us out of business.

1117
01:37:37,065 --> 01:37:38,358
Alive or dead

1118
01:37:38,358 --> 01:37:39,985
We do have a monopoly here at NURV.

1119
01:37:39,985 --> 01:37:43,989
There is no second place, one or
zero, alive or dead

1120
01:37:47,493 --> 01:37:48,994
Are you insane?
What do you think you're doing?

1121
01:37:48,994 --> 01:37:50,787
I'm letting people know
what you've been doing.

1122
01:37:50,787 --> 01:37:52,289
Phil, where is this signal coming from?

1123
01:37:52,289 --> 01:37:53,874
I'm working on it, I am working on it.

1124
01:37:53,874 --> 01:37:55,083
Work faster!

1125
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:58,462
A good chess player always knows his
opponent's moves before he makes them.
Isn't that right Gary?

1126
01:37:58,462 --> 01:38:02,466
You think you know all my moves?
You arrogant little bastard!

1127
01:38:02,674 --> 01:38:05,886
You think they're going to come after me?
Now that SYNAPSE is here?

1128
01:38:05,886 --> 01:38:09,181
This is the technology that'll fuel
business for the next 30 years!

1129
01:38:09,181 --> 01:38:12,267
You think they are going to allow foreign
competitors an opening like that?

1130
01:38:12,267 --> 01:38:14,269
Undermine the entire economy?

1131
01:38:14,269 --> 01:38:16,772
Over what? A cyber prank?

1132
01:38:16,772 --> 01:38:20,776
Then you don't have anything
to worry about. Do you?

1133
01:38:23,195 --> 01:38:25,781
The Lawyers are at the gate Gary.
They say the Feds are on their way.

1134
01:38:25,781 --> 01:38:27,366
Oh, Jesus!

1135
01:38:27,366 --> 01:38:29,284
It's coming from NURV. It's building 21.

1136
01:38:29,284 --> 01:38:30,661
Call security, get someone
over there now.

1137
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:32,162
Break down the door, if you have to.

1138
01:38:32,162 --> 01:38:34,164
But get me that disk. Get it here!

1139
01:38:34,164 --> 01:38:36,291
- How did this happen Phil?
- I dont know.

1140
01:38:36,291 --> 01:38:37,084
She called,

1141
01:38:37,084 --> 01:38:41,088
She said Milo had SYNAPSE,
he'd left the campus and..

1142
01:38:43,382 --> 01:38:46,176
You lied? For him?

1143
01:38:46,176 --> 01:38:48,262
You're playing with fire.

1144
01:38:48,262 --> 01:38:50,889
If you think for a second I won't
send you back where you came from...

1145
01:38:50,889 --> 01:38:54,893
Hey, Gary,
I want you to see this.

1146
01:38:59,773 --> 01:39:03,777
Are you still proud of me?

1147
01:39:16,665 --> 01:39:20,586
You guys know where you need to be..
Go, go, go!

1148
01:39:20,586 --> 01:39:24,590
Randy, Danny come on, let's get out
of here. Come on. Lets go, let's go.

1149
01:39:27,468 --> 01:39:31,472
Rebecca! Rebecca, come on, let's go.

1150
01:39:32,598 --> 01:39:36,393
I'm not going with you.

1151
01:39:36,393 --> 01:39:40,272
I'd rather stay here and face
the consequences of my own actions,

1152
01:39:40,272 --> 01:39:44,276
than be associated with yours.

1153
01:39:47,279 --> 01:39:48,572
This was mine, Milo.

1154
01:39:48,572 --> 01:39:51,783
You tell that to the people you
stole it from. Tell it to Teddy!

1155
01:39:51,783 --> 01:39:55,787
Come on. It's only a matter of time
before someone owns the information.

1156
01:39:56,079 --> 01:39:58,165
You can't stop it.
You just slowed it down.

1157
01:39:58,165 --> 01:40:01,168
I slowed you down Gary.
That's what matters to me.

1158
01:40:01,168 --> 01:40:02,961
This isn't a game.

1159
01:40:02,961 --> 01:40:06,965
In the real world, when you kill people,
they die. For real!

1160
01:40:07,382 --> 01:40:11,386
And in the real world,
you're Fucked!

1161
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:19,394
Are you coming?

1162
01:40:26,193 --> 01:40:28,570
Let them go.

1163
01:40:28,570 --> 01:40:32,574
Tomorrow, he's the most
famous geek in the world.

1164
01:40:36,995 --> 01:40:39,665
- Gary, we need information.
- I've been betrayed!

1165
01:40:39,665 --> 01:40:41,792
Randy and Phil are missing?

1166
01:40:41,792 --> 01:40:45,796
Something's going on! Take this down.

1167
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:49,466
It has come to my attention,

1168
01:40:49,466 --> 01:40:53,470
that certain rogue elements of my
company have been involved in
illegal activities

1169
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:57,474
in an attempt to discredit me and
risk control of my company.

1170
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:00,978
I'm most shocked and saddened
by this betrayal.

1171
01:41:00,978 --> 01:41:04,773
I will do everything in my power
to co-operate with the authorities

1172
01:41:04,773 --> 01:41:06,984
and to bring these criminals
to Justice.

1173
01:41:06,984 --> 01:41:10,988
...news that FBI agents have
arrested NURV CEO Gray Winston,

1174
01:41:10,988 --> 01:41:14,783
TV's, cell phones and PC's were
interrupted world-wide last night

1175
01:41:14,783 --> 01:41:18,787
by a rogue broadcast
initiated by programmer Milo Hoffmann.

1176
01:41:19,079 --> 01:41:22,583
Police have also arrested these
other members of Winston's team
at a Portland airfield

1177
01:41:22,583 --> 01:41:25,294
as they attempted to board a
private jet.

1178
01:41:25,294 --> 01:41:28,297
Justice officials reacted swiftly...

1179
01:41:28,297 --> 01:41:31,592
Man, Clinton's testimony didn't get
this many hits!

1180
01:41:31,592 --> 01:41:33,594
This is... this is awesome!

1181
01:41:33,594 --> 01:41:36,597
I mean, there's 400 requests
a second, Brian!

1182
01:41:36,597 --> 01:41:40,559
- We did this!
- I'm surprised this isn't blowing
the server!

1183
01:41:41,059 --> 01:41:43,187
Wow, Whoa get over her.

1184
01:41:43,187 --> 01:41:44,980
Come here, Come here...

1185
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:48,984
Already over 18 million people have
downloaded the source code for SYNAPSE

1186
01:41:48,984 --> 01:41:51,278
from the Skullbocks website.

1187
01:41:51,278 --> 01:41:55,282
Now Skullbocks is thought to have
originated right here in this
Palo Alto garage.

1188
01:42:07,878 --> 01:42:09,797
Hi. We've just a couple of questions
for you about SYNAPSE...

1189
01:42:09,797 --> 01:42:13,592
Is Milo Hoffmann going to testify?
Do you know where he is now?

1190
01:42:13,592 --> 01:42:17,596
How many hits have you guys
registered?

1191
01:42:21,975 --> 01:42:25,979
- Good luck.
- Okay.

1192
01:42:27,773 --> 01:42:30,067
Milo?

1193
01:42:30,067 --> 01:42:34,071
It wasn't all false.

1194
01:42:34,571 --> 01:42:36,865
I know.

1195
01:42:36,865 --> 01:42:40,869
Bye.

1196
01:42:42,287 --> 01:42:46,291
Do you consider this
an ultimate victory for open source?

1197
01:42:51,088 --> 01:42:55,092
- Excuse me.
- Milo?

1198
01:42:58,887 --> 01:43:02,266
- We did it, partner.
- Are you going to testify?

1199
01:43:02,266 --> 01:43:04,268
Winston always said
that any kid in a garage

1200
01:43:04,268 --> 01:43:07,271
could put him out of business.
Is that what you've done Milo?

1201
01:43:07,271 --> 01:43:08,772
This is a garage.

1202
01:43:08,772 --> 01:43:11,066
Hey, there he is.

1203
01:43:11,066 --> 01:43:12,985
...we're just now getting word that...

1204
01:43:12,985 --> 01:43:16,196
...yes, yes here he is.
Here's Gary Winston himself

1205
01:43:16,196 --> 01:43:20,159
being led by US marshals
to the federal court in Portland....

1206
01:43:26,999 --> 01:43:28,959
Milo, when did you first realize
that Winston is stealing code?

1207
01:43:28,959 --> 01:43:31,795
What is it exactly that you think
you have done, Milo?

1208
01:43:31,795 --> 01:43:32,963
And what does it all mean?

1209
01:43:32,963 --> 01:43:36,675
It means we've given SYNAPSE back
to the people it was stolen from.

1210
01:43:36,675 --> 01:43:38,677
Human knowledge belongs to the world.

1211
01:43:38,677 --> 01:43:42,681
Can we get a picture of the
Skullbocks team?
