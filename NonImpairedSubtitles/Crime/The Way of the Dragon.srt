Eggs.

00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,232
Eggs.

6
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,068
- Tang Lung?
- Miss Chen Ching Hua?

7
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,469
Yes. Why didn`t you wait for me
instead of running around?

8
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,989
My plane was early. I was hungry,
so I went to get a bite to eat.

9
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,198
How is my uncle in Hong Kong?

10
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,919
He`s not very well,
so I`ve come to help.

11
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,719
He wrote saying someone would come
but he didn`t say who.

12
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,031
How can you help me?

13
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,557
Please, as we`re family,
I`ve come specially to help you.

14
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,915
You`ve come specially to help me?

15
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,792
Do you know what the problem is?

16
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,632
Tell me later.

17
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,598
First, can you tell me
where the toilet is?

18
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,751
It`s a Ferrari.

19
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,751
Mustang?

20
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,518
A flying horse?

21
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,236
Dad died last month
and left me the restaurant.

22
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,471
Uncle Wang and the others
are helping me at the moment.

23
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,676
Business wasn`t bad at the beginning,

24
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,479
but there`s a huge
business syndicate here.

25
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,076
They`re interested in our property
and want me to sell up.

26
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,073
There`s no sale without agreement.

27
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,435
If you refuse, what can they do?

28
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,795
Of course you`re right...

29
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,119
but these bastards won`t listen
to reason.

30
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,352
They`ll do anything
to get my property.

31
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,798
They hired some gangsters
to watch the place.

32
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:40,035
If a customer approaches,
they simply drive him away.

33
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,953
- What am I to do?
- Why not report it?

34
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,874
They disappear
as soon as the police arrive.

35
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,430
The police can`t be there
24 hours a day.

36
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,395
Business is getting worse by the day.

37
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,677
So many mouths to feed
and wages to pay.

38
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,877
Expenses are so great,
I don`t know what to do.

39
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,795
The threats are getting worse,

40
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,758
they`re demanding
an immediate answer.

41
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,308
So that`s why I wrote to my uncle.

42
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,039
I thought he`d send a lawyer, but...

43
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,193
These are trivial matters,
he asked me personally to help you.

44
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,838
Don`t worry, Miss Chen.

45
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,753
It`s no problem,
I can take care of it.

46
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,636
Look, that`s their headquarters
up there.

47
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,476
Make yourself at home.

48
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,993
Here.

49
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,396
I rent this place.

50
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,234
The guys live at the restaurant.
It`s more convenient this way.

51
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,757
There`s a spare room,
my sick workers stay there sometimes.

52
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,908
There`s no room at the restaurant,
so you can stay here for now.

53
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,399
Since you are a friend,
make yourself at home.

54
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,631
Let me know
if there`s anything you need.

55
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,110
- Where is your toilet, please?
- It`s over there.

56
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,076
Chinese New Year is coming up,
it`s a joyous time in Hong Kong.

57
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,151
Do they celebrate it in Rome?

58
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,874
I haven`t been to Hong Kong
in over 10 years.

59
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,918
I`m sure it has changed a lot.

60
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,558
Has the restaurant business
changed much in Hong Kong?

61
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,194
I live in the country,
I don`t go to town much.

62
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,111
I practise martial arts every day.

63
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,510
Straight punch, hooked punch,
curved kick, flying kick!

64
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,077
Restaurants?

65
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,390
They haven`t changed much.

66
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,992
Sit down.

67
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,076
Here`s the key for the flat.

68
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,033
These are the details
of the flat and restaurant.

69
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,198
The restaurant is nearby.

70
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,315
If you get lost,

71
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,029
show that card and any taxi driver
will bring you back here.

72
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,796
Taxi? They`re far too expensive here.
Don`t they have any buses?

73
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,233
Do you need money?

74
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,880
No, I brought some with me.

75
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,351
You`d better put it in the bank.
It`s safer that way.

76
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,919
No, it`s safer and easier
to carry it.

77
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,515
I won`t argue.
How much did you bring?

78
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,712
Not much.

79
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,359
Really, not very much.

80
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,275
I still say it`s safer in the bank.
Let`s go.

81
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,149
How much do you have? Let`s see it.

82
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,276
How much do you want in lira?

83
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,112
20 will do.

84
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,957
Foreign currencies have been
depreciating drastically.

85
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,674
That was the bank manager,
not a pickpocket. Show some manners.

86
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,719
There are a lot of criminals
out there, but not everyone is bad.

87
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,030
Besides, I know that bank manager.

88
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,230
Foreigners are warm and polite,
and very welcoming.

89
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,233
When people smile, smile back
at them. That`s basic manners.

90
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,272
When someone puts their arm around
you, it`s a sign of affection,

91
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,555
you should reciprocate.

92
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,874
You should remember what I`ve said,
or you`ll be sorry.

93
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,999
Ah Lung?

94
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,509
You must be Ah Lung! Welcome to Rome!

95
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,469
I`m Ah Quen
from Miss Chen`s restaurant.

96
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,515
Ah Quen!

97
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,752
Miss Chen got tired of waiting
so she went back to the restaurant.

98
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,558
She asked me to take you there.

99
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,748
By the way, where were you just now?

100
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,038
Let`s go.

101
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,069
The Shanghai.

102
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,756
Uncle Wang, this is Ah Lung.

103
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,110
Ah Lung, this is Uncle Wang.

104
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,553
Uncle Wang.

105
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,837
Don`t be so formal, we are family.

106
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,276
Sit down.

107
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,794
Ah Quen, make some tea.

108
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,317
You`ve been flying all day,
you must be tired.

109
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,597
You`ve been living in Hong Kong,
you must find it strange here.

110
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,588
Everything has been strange,
since I got off the plane.

111
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,548
You`ll get used to it.

112
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,390
It`s been such a long time...

113
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,836
since I was back in Hong Kong.

114
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,277
- How are things there?
- In Hong Kong?

115
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,351
I don`t go into town very often.

116
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,797
But out in the country...

117
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,233
Have some tea.

118
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,596
Come, let`s have some.

119
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,793
Thank you.

120
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,114
It`s a big place,
why are there no customers?

121
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,917
With those gangsters hanging about,
who`d dare come in here?

122
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,199
Ah Lung, there are more workers
practising Karate out back.

123
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,998
Let`s go and meet them.

124
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,959
There`s no business,
so they spend their time exercising.

125
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,428
Come on!

126
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,275
Before Mr Chen passed away,

127
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,069
they learned Karate
to take care of those gangsters.

128
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,434
Why don`t you learn?

129
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,114
I`m not interested
in foreign martial arts.

130
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,351
The style isn`t important

131
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,069
as long as you are using your body
to its fullest extent.

132
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,676
Even in the midst of violent movement
you can achieve your goals

133
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,591
and express yourself.

134
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,913
I`d prefer to learn Kung-Fu.

135
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,995
- Can you do Kung-Fu?
- Yes.

136
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,354
Really?

137
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,352
OK, let`s take a break.

138
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,632
Come over here.

139
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,071
This is Tang Lung.
Introduce yourselves.

140
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,639
My name is Tony.

141
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,631
I`m Jimmy.

142
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,278
Thomas.

143
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,349
Robert.

144
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,590
I`ve got no English name.
Call me Ah Kun.

145
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,474
He looks like your typical
Kung-Fu expert.

146
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,838
Can you fight?

147
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,276
Ah Lung came from Hong Kong
to help us.

148
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,397
He`s not bad at Kung-Fu.

149
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,397
I`ve just studied a little.

150
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:53,237
Kung-Fu? That`s all just Tai Chi.
It lacks strength.

151
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,154
Whatever the style, it all lacks
strength if you don`t learn it right.

152
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,468
Yeah!

153
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,956
How do you develop strength then?

154
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,192
By training from the waist up,
you become one with your body.

155
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,629
Will you demonstrate
how to be one with the body?

156
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,949
I might hurt someone.

157
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,955
What?

158
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,392
Don`t worry about it, they`ve got
protective pads. They`ll be OK.

159
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,517
Go on, go on. It`s just a bit of fun.

160
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,352
Hold it tightly.

161
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,839
We`ve got some customers.
You`d better change and get to work.

162
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,875
Hurry.

163
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,632
Come on, let`s go.

164
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,397
Change and get cracking.

165
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,829
Ah Quen, where`s the toilet?

166
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,471
The toilet? It`s over there.
The sign is in English.

167
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,718
What have you decided?

168
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,677
- Uncle Wang!
- Yes?

169
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,030
Quick, they`re here again!

170
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,395
Stop, stop it!

171
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,548
If you don`t answer by tonight,
don`t blame us for getting rough.

172
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,429
Mr Ho, please help us out.
Put in a good word for us.

173
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,557
Give us a few more days
to think it over.

174
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,599
A few more days?! A few more days?!

175
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,834
You`ve continuously delayed things.
Are you selling or not?

176
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,672
Hey, don`t hit him.

177
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,036
Don`t fight, please.
You`ll only wreck our own things.

178
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,272
Remember, you must give us
your answer by tonight.

179
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,278
Sorry.

180
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,870
Watch where you`re going next time.

181
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,189
You can`t even speak a word
of English.

182
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,157
Why did my uncle send you here?

183
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,914
Ah Lung, they`re young
and headstrong, don`t blame them.

184
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,956
Everything will be all right.

185
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,477
That was disappointing.

186
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,996
It`s lucky they didn`t
bring guns with them.

187
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:14,518
In broad daylight? They wouldn`t
dare use a gun in public.

188
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,716
If Uncle Wang hadn`t stopped us,

189
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,190
I`d have given them a taste
of my Karate.

190
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,792
You`re full of hot air. You`re always
practising, but what good is it?

191
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,949
At least it`s better than Kung-Fu.

192
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,271
When he bumped into you,
you didn`t dare say a word.

193
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,390
You even apologised to him!

194
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,278
And he says Kung-Fu is great!

195
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,398
- OK, here come some customers.
- Serve the customers, quickly.

196
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,672
Ah Quen, get Uncle Wang
out here to help us.

197
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,079
Stop messing around.

198
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,789
Remember this is our place,
so we have to pay for breakages.

199
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,552
We can`t take this any more!

200
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,599
- Ah Lung, you...
- Let`s go!

201
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,755
Jimmy!

202
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,714
Jimmy.

203
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,589
You bastard! Are you blind?
This isn`t Kung-Fu.

204
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,276
If I knew how to do Kung-Fu,
I`d give you a taste of it!

205
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,112
I`ll go.

206
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,197
Tell him this is Kung-Fu.

207
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,989
The Golden Dragon, movement four -
Little Dragon Seeks the Path.

208
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,789
Big Dragon Shakes His Tail.

209
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,952
- Ah Lung! He`s really good!
- He`s got some moves.

210
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,510
- Magnificent!
- Excellent!

211
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,874
You`re really good!

212
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,076
Congratulations, that was great!

213
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,596
Ah Lung, you`re really magnificent.

214
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,830
Don`t get so excited,
there`ll be more trouble to come.

215
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,071
With skill like Ah Lung`s,
we`ve nothing to fear,

216
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,913
the more they come,
the more they`ll suffer!

217
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,233
You guys are still young,
you have no fear of death.

218
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,351
There`s an old Chinese saying:

219
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,512
"Not even the tiger can beat
the worms at the end!"

220
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:27,109
Remember, this is their territory.
One day they will get their revenge.

221
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,158
I told you to be careful.

222
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,119
We should restrain ourselves
and resolve this by peaceful means.

223
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,112
We`ve nothing to fear,
the dragon`s on our side.

224
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,112
Mark my words
or there will be trouble.

225
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,270
- What trouble?
- There`s no trouble.

226
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,079
Calm down everyone,
we`ll work this out.

227
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,796
Ah Lung, it`s late
and you must be tired, let`s go home.

228
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,952
Do you want some supper?

229
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,669
No, I must get up early for training.

230
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,037
I hear it`s easy
to buy a gun here.

231
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,669
Yes, any local citizen
can get a licence.

232
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,636
- What are you doing?
- Making darts.

233
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,948
Darts?

234
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,433
Food`s up.

235
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,473
Let`s have one, then.

236
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,754
Stop!

237
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:58,834
You want to eat? You can eat
when you`re as good as Ah Lung.

238
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,595
You`d better go
and practise your Karate.

239
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,310
So it`s for Brother Lung?
Why didn`t you say so?

240
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,152
Brother Lung?

241
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,839
Here he is.

242
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,752
Brother Lung!

243
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,671
Good morning, Brother Lung.

244
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,919
Out of the way.

245
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,279
Brother Lung, I made this breakfast
especially for you.

246
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,032
Eat it while it`s hot.

247
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,634
Please, take a seat.

248
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,631
Yeah, sit, sit.

249
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,154
Your Kung-Fu is really terrific.

250
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,310
Who was your teacher in Hong Kong?

251
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,878
Watch this.

252
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,239
Little Dragon Seeks the Path.
Big Dragon Shakes His Tail.

253
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,834
In two moves, he takes them out!

254
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,674
You said Kung-Fu lacks power.

255
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,470
I was only kidding.

256
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,509
Ah Lung, you were too fast yesterday.
We couldn`t see clearly.

257
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,114
Will you show us again?

258
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,191
Go on, show us!

259
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,752
I want to see
how magnificent you are too.

260
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,557
OK, Brother Lung,
show him your moves.

261
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,232
Let`s go! Show us!

262
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,828
Hold this!

263
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,480
You take this one.

264
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,312
Don`t get in his way.

265
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,558
Everybody says you`re fast and
powerful. I didn`t see it last night.

266
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,839
Didn`t you say you have to be
one with your body to gain power?

267
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,639
Why not show us, then?

268
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,474
Hey, stop yabbering on.
Let Brother Lung show you.

269
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,516
Get out of the way.

270
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,154
Are you all right?

271
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,430
- Are you all right?
- Are you OK?

272
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,351
I`m OK.

273
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,954
- Fantastic!
- Yeah!

274
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,632
You`re the greatest!

275
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,998
Ah Lung, will you be
my Kung-Fu master?

276
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,157
You said physical training
was useless. Why the sudden interest?

277
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:04,189
That`s because it was Karate.
This is Kung-Fu. Get it?

278
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,793
He`s stupid.

279
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,916
We`ll give up Karate.

280
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,514
Let`s ask Brother Lung
to be our master.

281
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,113
Is that OK?

282
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,390
Customers, come quick!

283
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,636
We`re coming!

284
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,631
After you, Brother Lung.

285
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,119
Mind your step.

286
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,916
Go and get changed. Be quick.

287
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,390
Ah Lung, no, master, I have to take
care of the customers now.

288
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,472
We`ll talk further when we close.

289
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,556
Is there anything for me to do?

290
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,279
Keep a look out for those gangsters.

291
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,998
- What was that?
- He wants us to see his boss.

292
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,393
See you tomorrow.

293
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,631
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

294
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,234
Sit down.

295
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,988
Eat.

296
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,675
It`s hard to find this in Rome.
Is it good?

297
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,676
It`s not as good as in Hong Kong.

298
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,512
I cooked it.

299
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,436
It`s all right. Help yourself.

300
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,755
And you?

301
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,956
Would you like some more?

302
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,554
When you`ve finished, I`ll take you
sightseeing around Rome.

303
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,155
Get over there.

304
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,838
Where is the man called Tang
from Hong Kong?

305
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,876
Tell him to get out here.

306
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,233
Where is he? Tell us.

307
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,197
I don`t know.

308
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,074
Are you going to talk?

309
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,391
Don`t hit him, I`ll talk.

310
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,959
He`ll be here soon.

311
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,315
Where is he now?

312
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,428
Look, these are famous ancient ruins.

313
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,948
Over there...

314
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,468
What is it?

315
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,317
Our area has more run-down buildings
than this.

316
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,155
Let`s go.

317
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,554
A king built these gardens
for his queen.

318
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,791
It took a lot of time and money.

319
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,792
They must have been
very much in love.

320
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,072
Are you married?

321
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,915
How do you like the palaces?

322
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,915
Such a big place is a waste.

323
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,596
If I had this space in Hong Kong,

324
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,672
I would build a skyscraper
and collect rent.

325
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,115
We`d better get to the restaurant.

326
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,759
The boss means you`re both men
of the world. He likes your style.

327
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,398
He appreciates talent.

328
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,758
Oh, what muscles!
We don`t want to harm you.

329
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,271
Here`s a ticket back to Hong Kong.

330
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,797
No need to trouble yourself with
these small matters. Enjoy yourself.

331
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:26,437
I told you so.
Now look what you`ve done.

332
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:34,599
Miss Chen, why cause more trouble?
You might as well accept our offer.

333
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,673
We take our business seriously.

334
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,799
We`re offering you a good deal.
What do you say?

335
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,959
Tell him this...

336
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,755
If there is any more trouble...

337
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,917
I will retaliate.

338
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,594
Tell him!

339
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,074
Get rid of them.

340
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,317
Go on, get out!

341
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,190
Ah Lung, hold it, that`s a customer.

342
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,479
Please come in.

343
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,788
Welcome.

344
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,158
They`ve come to eat.

345
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,719
Put that away.

346
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,598
Come on,
tidy up and serve our customers.

347
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,550
See? I asked you
to restrain yourselves.

348
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,077
Now look what`s happened.
You lot and your pig-headedness.

349
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,639
What will we do now?

350
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,950
We`re not afraid.
We`ll fight to the end.

351
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,238
This is no joke. They mean business.

352
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,197
I know, but...

353
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:08,153
I know how you feel,
but we must think of Tang Lung.

354
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,676
They mean what they say.

355
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,829
You mean...

356
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,956
Keep him out of sight for a while.

357
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,750
Tomorrow is the Chinese New Year.
If there is trouble...

358
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,478
I don`t know if he`ll agree.

359
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:25,951
I know he`s stubborn,
but you must persuade him.

360
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,999
Without our master, we`ll be forced
to sell the restaurant.

361
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,071
That`s not what I mean.

362
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:39,475
We`ll cross that bridge when we come
to it. If we fail, then we`ll talk.

363
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:43,712
Whatever happens,
we mustn`t sell the restaurant.

364
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,871
- You decide for me.
- All right.

365
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,159
It`s gone eleven.
You go and talk to Ah Lung.

366
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,316
Tomorrow is Chinese New Year.
Is the restaurant open?

367
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,718
Good, we`ll go to the countryside
and practise.

368
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,633
Remind Ah Quen
to bring the protective padding.

369
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,073
Firecrackers?

370
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:52,351
They`re banned in Hong Kong.
There must be Chinese living nearby.

371
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,191
Don`t ask me why,
but you must leave Rome for a while.

372
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,474
Leave Rome?

373
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:13,193
We don`t want you to go,
especially me, but you must.

374
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,192
- Do you understand me?
- No, l don`t.

375
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,913
Ah Lung, why don`t you...

376
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,876
- Are you scared of firecrackers?
- I`ll take you to the airport.

377
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,076
- Why?
- Those white guys will...

378
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,516
My duty is to help you.

379
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,272
I know, but you must leave.

380
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,077
- They`re going to kill you.
- Kill me? Who?

381
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,270
Time`s up, let`s go!

382
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,356
It`s too noisy. I`ll close the...

383
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,999
Stay here and don`t move.

384
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,474
Miss Chen?

385
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,557
Miss Chen, don`t waste
any more of our time.

386
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,518
Here is the sale agreement.

387
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,553
- Sign it.
- No.

388
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,550
Why are you so stubborn?
Our boss has been so nice to you.

389
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,431
If I draw this knife across
your face...

390
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,396
that would be a shame.

391
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,036
Don`t keep us waiting.
Our boss is an impatient man.

392
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,190
Whatever you say, I won`t sign.

393
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,598
We`re only trying to help you.
It`s for your own good.

394
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,798
We`ll get the restaurant
sooner or later anyway.

395
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,793
Don`t be so sure. Tang Lung
and the others will be here soon.

396
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,111
Tang Lung?
You think he will come here?

397
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:55,516
He`s playing Mahjong
with Our Lord in Heaven.

398
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,675
Tang Lung.

399
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,309
Be careful!

400
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,633
Be careful!

401
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,716
The mastermind is over there.

402
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,794
Let me tell you...

403
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,599
Tang Lung,
he doesn`t understand you.

404
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,708
Let`s go.

405
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,038
Happy Chinese New Year!

406
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,153
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

407
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,514
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

408
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,556
- Thank you.
- Thank you, thank you.

409
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:03,993
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

410
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,150
Thank you, Uncle Wang.

411
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:12,076
I didn`t expect traditional
lucky money abroad.

412
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,274
Uncle Wang gives us lucky money
every year.

413
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:19,510
This is my best New Year`s ever!

414
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,154
First, we successfully defended
our restaurant.

415
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:29,916
And second, we have Ah Lung with us
who is also our master.

416
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,839
Third, we finally defeated
those gangsters.

417
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:44,752
Let`s skip the violence
and enjoy the New Year.

418
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,318
Here comes Ching Hua.

419
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,991
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

420
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:57,112
- This is for you.
- Thank you, Uncle Wang.

421
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,113
Ah Lung, a telegram for you.

422
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,719
It`s from my uncle.

423
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,951
He wants you to go
and help someone else.

424
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,352
Don`t be like that.

425
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,113
If I get the chance, I`ll be back.

426
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:50,955
Miss Chen, I won`t leave
until this whole thing is settled.

427
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,756
Happy New Year.

428
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,275
What beautiful decorations!

429
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,991
You`re having a little party.

430
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,399
What do you want?

431
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:17,789
Today is Chinese New Year,
I`ve come to wish you the best.

432
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:23,234
I must apologise,
it was all our fault.

433
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:27,199
We must all be friends.

434
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:30,397
Our boss would like to see Mr Tang.

435
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,075
Would he do us the honour?

436
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:40,876
OK, a new year, a new beginning.
Business will be good this year.

437
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,555
Tell your boss we`ll be there.

438
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,792
Fine! The Empress Restaurant
tomorrow morning.

439
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,670
You`re here. Sit down.

440
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,634
Sorry our boss couldn`t make it.

441
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,551
Are you pulling our legs?

442
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,792
An urgent matter came up.
He couldn`t get away.

443
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,911
My car is just outside.
I`ll take you to him.

444
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,309
What? We`re to go to him?

445
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,710
Never mind. Take us there.

446
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,429
Right. I admire people
who come straight to the point.

447
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,508
Let`s go.

448
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,353
Where is he?

449
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,112
He`s gone.

450
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,997
Forget it. He won`t get away.

451
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,958
It`s a trap. Be careful, everyone.

452
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:52,594
Master.

453
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:56,434
The three of us can handle him.

454
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,748
I`ll go first.

455
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,593
Are you Tang Lung?

456
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,513
Are you Tang Lung?

457
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,276
Leave him, he`s finished.

458
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:58,558
Ah Lung, we were lucky this time
not to have fallen into their trap.

459
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,392
Tang Lung!

460
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,550
If you`ve got the balls, follow me!

461
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:07,876
Ah Lung, follow him.
Don`t let him get away.

462
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:10,758
Tony and Jimmy can
take care of the Japanese.

463
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,555
Tony, are you all right?

464
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:34,677
I`m tired and I`m hurting all over.

465
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,790
Uncle Wang, why...

466
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:04,990
Don`t blame me. If you must blame
someone, it should be Ah Lung.

467
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:10,791
Yes, Ah Lung got you into this mess.

468
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,714
He shouldn`t have stood in the way
of my fortune and happiness.

469
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:16,789
You...

470
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:21,078
What do you mean?

471
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:24,311
What do I mean? You know.

472
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,595
Working men have no future.

473
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:29,035
I`ve worked all my life and for what?

474
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:32,112
I can`t even clothe
or feed myself properly.

475
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:38,595
I have a wife and children.
I want the best for them.

476
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:42,992
If the restaurant co-operates,
they`ll pay me a big reward.

477
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:47,790
Then I can return to Hong Kong
and enjoy my family life.

478
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:54,073
I`ve worked here all my life.
I want to take it easy now.

479
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,680
Tang Lung, you`ve got guts!

480
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:30,073
Tang Lung, the man you just saw
will be your downfall!

481
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:58,399
Tang Lung, you`re on
the path to total destruction.

482
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,957
Tang Lung,
today you will meet your death.

483
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,913
Ho!

484
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:59,353
Wang, we`ve failed.

485
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:09,439
Hold it!

486
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,718
We`ve been tricked!

487
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,588
Tony and Jimmy... Look!

488
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:33,239
Brother Lung, don`t be angry, please.

489
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:37,438
Listen, Mr Tang.

490
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,516
Now it`s all over...

491
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,398
I must go.

492
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:46,750
I`ll see you off.

493
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:47,829
No need.

494
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,388
Ah Quen has a car waiting.

495
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,513
Take care of yourself.

496
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:30,433
Wherever he goes

497
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,795
in this dog-eat-dog world...

498
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,989
he will be admired by all.

499
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,188
