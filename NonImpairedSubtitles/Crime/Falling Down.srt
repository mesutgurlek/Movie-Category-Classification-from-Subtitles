1
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,757
Where do you think you're going?

2
00:04:43,144 --> 00:04:44,852
Going home.

3
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:31,852
Officer.

4
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:36,391
The guy walked into the bushes,
maybe to pee, but he never came back.

5
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:38,108
Do you need help?

6
00:05:38,693 --> 00:05:39,938
Do you own this car?

7
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:42,863
That's not him.
The guy walked into the bushes.

8
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:44,738
He said he was going home.

9
00:05:45,115 --> 00:05:46,230
Going home?

10
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,073
Gentlemen, return to your cars.

11
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:50,525
What about the car?

12
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:52,828
I'll radio for a tow truck.

13
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,366
Let's shove it out of the way.
We'll get this lane moving!

14
00:05:57,084 --> 00:05:58,364
It's dangerous.

15
00:05:58,627 --> 00:06:02,838
We got a lot of glass and steel
rushing by us at high speeds.

16
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:05,044
Wait a minute.

17
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,715
Prendergast. Downtown Robbery.
Let's go.

18
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,678
I'm in linoleum tile, myself.

19
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:14,806
All right.
You, back in your vehicle.

20
00:06:15,016 --> 00:06:17,056
You push. I'll steer.

21
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,513
We do ceramics too.
Special discount for law officers.

22
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:28,435
I love Cops, the TV show.
Don't you watch it? I never miss it.

23
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:30,195
You're lucky you caught me.

24
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:31,395
I am?

25
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:34,063
Today's my last day as a cop.

26
00:06:35,242 --> 00:06:36,487
Lucky me.

27
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:40,776
Don't touch it!

28
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,708
Don't touch it!
Just get this lane moving.

29
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,832
Okay. Sorry.

30
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,200
Officer?

31
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:05,767
Oh, my God! The phone!

32
00:07:07,062 --> 00:07:08,521
Come on, baby.

33
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:13,483
Watch your fingers.

34
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:15,853
Take Tucker, okay?

35
00:07:24,202 --> 00:07:25,661
Mom?

36
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:29,991
Mom, can you help me open this?

37
00:08:14,913 --> 00:08:17,320
Can I get some change
for the phone, please?

38
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,288
No change. Have to buy something.

39
00:09:08,252 --> 00:09:10,659
- Eighty-fie sen.
- What?

40
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,207
Eighty-fie sen.

41
00:09:12,881 --> 00:09:15,632
- I don't understand.
- Eighty-fie sen!

42
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:18,960
Eighty-five cents?

43
00:09:19,845 --> 00:09:22,799
It doesn't give me enough money
for the phone call.

44
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:29,850
I'll give you 50 cents.
You give me 50 cents change.

45
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:32,809
- No way.
- Yes, way.

46
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:35,931
Drink, eighty-fie sen.
You pay or go!

47
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,108
I don't understand "fie."
There's a "v" in the word "five."

48
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:41,519
No "v's" in China?

49
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:44,402
- Not Chinese. I'm Korean.
- Whatever.

50
00:09:44,658 --> 00:09:49,284
You come to my country, take my money
and don't even learn my language?

51
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:54,075
You're Korean?

52
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:59,044
Do you have any idea how much money
my country has given your country?

53
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,375
How much?

54
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:05,543
I don't know. It's a lot.
You can bet on that.

55
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:08,170
You go now! No trouble!

56
00:10:11,015 --> 00:10:12,639
I stay.

57
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:14,684
What do you think of that?

58
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:33,732
Jesus Christ!

59
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,990
What is this?

60
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,827
The last stand on Fiji?

61
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,867
Take the money! Take the money!

62
00:10:42,126 --> 00:10:43,406
Take the money.

63
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:46,746
Take your hands away from your...
I can't under... Stop it!

64
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:51,630
All right.
Speak slowly and distinctly.

65
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:53,171
Take the money.

66
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,427
You think I'm a thief?

67
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:06,051
You see, I'm not the thief.

68
00:11:06,313 --> 00:11:09,267
I'm not the one charging 85 cents
for a stinking soda!

69
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:11,019
You're the thief!

70
00:11:14,446 --> 00:11:18,312
I'm just standing up
for my rights as a consumer.

71
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:24,034
I'm rolling back prices to 1965.
What do you think of that?

72
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:30,750
Doughnuts. Package of six.
How much?

73
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,290
$1. 12.

74
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:36,625
Too much.

75
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:41,676
Aspirin. Price?

76
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:43,127
$3.40.

77
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:44,919
Oh, please!

78
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,765
AA batteries. Package of four.

79
00:11:56,357 --> 00:11:57,520
$4.29.

80
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:00,859
Nice try.

81
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,396
This whole shelf looks suspect.

82
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,409
One soda...

83
00:12:18,627 --> 00:12:20,002
...12 ounces.

84
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:23,041
Fifty sen!

85
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:27,753
Sold.

86
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:48,312
It's been a pleasure
frequenting your establishment.

87
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:00,788
Very funny.

88
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:02,990
Very, very funny.

89
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,749
Genuine Arizona sand, Prendergast.
Get used to it.

90
00:13:06,961 --> 00:13:07,791
I bet.

91
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,542
Genuine Santa Monica sand's
more like it.

92
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:15,009
It's from my cat's litterbox,
but he said you could keep the lumps.

93
00:13:18,304 --> 00:13:19,928
You took my stuff out first?

94
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:21,841
Heck, no. How fun would that be?

95
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:25,924
- How do I get a pen out?
- Don't need no pen. Use the cat turd.

96
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:31,897
It's your last day. Be careful.
Remember Forsythe?

97
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:35,858
- Forsythe got 5 minutes to retirement.
- Two!

98
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:39,812
Two minutes, nothing! The guy was
on the way to his fucking car.

99
00:13:40,073 --> 00:13:43,323
Mowed down by a runaway impound.
Nasty.

100
00:13:43,618 --> 00:13:45,326
- Ironic.
- Ironic as fuck!

101
00:13:45,536 --> 00:13:47,493
Anything can happen today.

102
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,285
You know how dangerous a desk can be.

103
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:53,038
Watch out for paper cuts.

104
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:54,998
Funny, funny, funny.

105
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:57,998
Sorry.
I tried to dissuade them.

106
00:13:58,256 --> 00:14:01,790
Hey, Sandra.
It's obligatory, I guess.

107
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:06,127
Now, what else do they
have up their sleeve?

108
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:07,967
Nothing.

109
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:14,094
Are we still on for lunch?
You're not going home early?

110
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,675
Why would I go home early?

111
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,730
Last day and all.

112
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,357
I'm not superstitious.

113
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,814
- Sandy, you ready?
- In a minute.

114
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,482
Leave the poor desk jockey alone.

115
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:26,569
See if you know how to start the car.

116
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,152
Let's not get
our pantyhose in a bind.

117
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:32,659
I'll miss you, Prendergast.

118
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,742
You really will? Me too.

119
00:14:37,082 --> 00:14:38,326
Come on, let's go!

120
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,160
Lunch?

121
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:05,229
Just a second, baby.

122
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,396
When will we make
the strawberry cake?

123
00:15:08,651 --> 00:15:11,058
Soon. I thought
sundown would be good.

124
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,105
Here. Not in the house.

125
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:17,279
Just a few kids. I didn't want
to do a whole big thing.

126
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:55,973
Prendergast here.

127
00:15:58,236 --> 00:16:00,228
It's me.

128
00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:04,608
I wish you were home.
Wouldn't you come home now?

129
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:06,492
What's wrong?

130
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:08,281
I don't know.

131
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:11,695
I got a little scared...

132
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,707
...and I'd like you to come home.

133
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:18,703
What is it, honey?

134
00:16:21,798 --> 00:16:24,336
I don't know.
I was wrapping some...

135
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:27,510
...some glasses up
and some things...

136
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:31,507
...and I got really scared.

137
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:38,390
You're not doing this move
just for me, are you?

138
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:41,357
You really want
to do it, don't you?

139
00:16:42,191 --> 00:16:45,394
The important thing is we're together.
That's what counts.

140
00:16:46,195 --> 00:16:47,986
Yeah, but you're not here.

141
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:50,439
Well, I will be soon, baby.

142
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:56,197
Say it.

143
00:16:58,497 --> 00:17:00,786
- Say it!
- I'll be home soon.

144
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,956
No, say it!

145
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:07,369
I'll be home soon, and I love you.

146
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:11,590
I love you too.

147
00:17:13,302 --> 00:17:14,132
Feel better?

148
00:17:14,636 --> 00:17:16,428
No, I don't feel better!

149
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:21,841
London Bridge is falling down

150
00:17:22,477 --> 00:17:24,386
Falling down, falling down

151
00:17:24,645 --> 00:17:26,803
London bridge is falling down
Help me.

152
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:30,358
My fair lady

153
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,318
You my fair lady?

154
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:38,656
Yes.

155
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,484
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

156
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:35,787
What you doing, mister?

157
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,875
Nothing.

158
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:40,789
You're trespassing on private property.

159
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:42,628
- Trespassing?
- Loitering too.

160
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:45,045
That's right.
You're loitering too.

161
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,582
I didn't see any signs.

162
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:49,968
What you call that?

163
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:52,882
Graffiti?

164
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:54,511
No, man.

165
00:18:55,391 --> 00:18:58,511
That's not fucking graffiti!
That's a sign.

166
00:18:58,811 --> 00:19:00,803
He can't read it, man.

167
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:04,769
I'll read it for you.
It says this is private property.

168
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:07,606
No fucking trespassing.

169
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:09,983
This means fucking you!

170
00:19:11,614 --> 00:19:14,152
- It says all that?
- Yeah!

171
00:19:14,783 --> 00:19:17,784
If you wrote it in English,
I'd fucking understand it!

172
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:20,694
- Thinks he's being funny.
- I'm not laughing.

173
00:19:20,914 --> 00:19:23,618
- I'm not either.
- Hold it, fellas.

174
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,668
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

175
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:32,463
This is a gangland thing, isn't it?

176
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:36,256
We're having a territorial dispute?

177
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:41,674
I've wandered into your pissing ground
or whatever the damn thing is...

178
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,093
...and you're offended by my presence.
I understand that.

179
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,928
I mean, I wouldn't want you people
in my back yard, either.

180
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,890
This is your home...

181
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,776
...and your home is your home.
I respect that.

182
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:58,278
So if you would just back up
a step or two...

183
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,069
...I'll take my problems elsewhere.

184
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:03,691
Fair enough?

185
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:05,944
- What do you think?
- He should pay a toll.

186
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:07,953
Good idea.

187
00:20:08,414 --> 00:20:10,240
You should pay a toll.

188
00:20:11,124 --> 00:20:12,618
Listen, fellas...

189
00:20:12,918 --> 00:20:15,954
...I've had a rare morning.
I'm not in the mood to...

190
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:17,375
What should he pay?

191
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,208
How about that briefcase?

192
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:21,792
Good idea.

193
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:24,582
Give us your briefcase, man.

194
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:29,886
I'm not giving you
my goddamn briefcase.

195
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:33,260
Motherfucker, give us
your motherfucking briefcase!

196
00:20:41,985 --> 00:20:44,654
I was willing
to mind my own business.

197
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:49,530
I was willing to respect your territory
and treat you like a man.

198
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:51,320
You couldn't let a man...

199
00:20:51,577 --> 00:20:56,534
...sit here for five minutes to rest
on your precious piece-of-shit hill?

200
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,411
Want my briefcase?
I'll get it for you, all right?

201
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,243
You want my briefcase?
Here's my briefcase!

202
00:21:13,095 --> 00:21:14,554
Where are you going?

203
00:21:14,764 --> 00:21:16,756
You forgot the briefcase!

204
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:27,314
I'm going home!
Clear the path, you motherfucker!

205
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:30,105
Clear the path!

206
00:21:30,527 --> 00:21:32,401
I'm going home!

207
00:21:52,797 --> 00:21:54,706
How'd they do that?

208
00:21:58,343 --> 00:21:59,458
- Gun!
- What?

209
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,255
You're leaving today, right?
I gotta get your gun.

210
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,469
Right.

211
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:11,099
I need your John Doe
right here, here and here.

212
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:21,945
Got time to take a statement?

213
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:24,523
I know you wanna go
before you get killed...

214
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:27,113
Yeah, Brian, I'm still working here.

215
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:28,987
This guy's a little excited.

216
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:31,611
Mr. Lee, come on in.

217
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:36,745
What'd he say?

218
00:22:37,086 --> 00:22:39,921
You know, I don't know.
Mr. Lee is Korean.

219
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,499
I'm Japanese, in case
you never bothered to notice.

220
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:46,499
- Mr. Lee, speak English, okay?
- Sure.

221
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:48,297
Sit down.

222
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:53,390
He'll help you. Mr. Lee owns a market.
He was hit less than an hour ago.

223
00:22:53,642 --> 00:22:56,014
Sorry, Mr. Lee, no smoking.

224
00:22:57,354 --> 00:23:00,687
Mr. Lee, let's just start off
with what he looked like.

225
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:05,444
White man, white shirt, tie.

226
00:23:05,903 --> 00:23:08,310
- What color was his tie?
- Color?

227
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:13,693
I don't know color.
The guy attack me, okay?

228
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,400
He bust up my store.
I'm lucky to be alive.

229
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:20,079
Just try and relax.
What did he steal from you?

230
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,532
Did not steal!
Attack me, okay?

231
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:25,663
Say he fix my prices.
Bust up my merchandise.

232
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:26,869
He didn't rob you?

233
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:30,166
The guy crazy! I told him,
"Take my money."

234
00:23:30,424 --> 00:23:34,967
He say no. He call me "thief,"
then he break up my merchandise.

235
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,047
Then he buy a soda and take off.

236
00:23:37,722 --> 00:23:39,845
He bought a soda. He paid for it?

237
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:42,305
I told you, the guy crazy.

238
00:23:42,602 --> 00:23:44,641
Sorry, I thought this was a robbery.

239
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:48,010
Mr. Lee, we have to go
talk to somebody else.

240
00:23:48,357 --> 00:23:51,441
You were assaulted.
This man works robberies.

241
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:53,567
That's right. Come on.

242
00:23:56,155 --> 00:23:58,361
- Baseball bat!
- What's that?

243
00:23:58,616 --> 00:24:00,158
The guy take my baseball bat.

244
00:24:00,534 --> 00:24:01,364
You sell bats?

245
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,194
No, keep for defense.
Under counter. Defense.

246
00:24:05,455 --> 00:24:08,906
You mean he stole your baseball bat
but paid for the soda?

247
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,530
This guy's discriminating.

248
00:24:10,793 --> 00:24:13,248
That still doesn't count.
Let's go. Thanks.

249
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:19,543
Go to the hospital.
Your arm might be broken!

250
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,428
We'll look for this guy,
so shut the fuck up!

251
00:24:22,637 --> 00:24:26,171
What did this guy do?
Threaten you with his credit card?

252
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,014
I told you he had a bat!

253
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:31,558
If this guy's still around,
we'll find him and fuck him up.

254
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,264
Then you go to the hospital?

255
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:34,766
Shut up!

256
00:24:50,745 --> 00:24:52,986
Cut the crap.
I know it's you.

257
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,446
What do you want?

258
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:59,451
It is you, isn't it?

259
00:25:01,754 --> 00:25:03,035
Yeah, it's me.

260
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:10,088
You gotta stop calling me.

261
00:25:11,304 --> 00:25:13,178
It's Adele's birthday.

262
00:25:14,307 --> 00:25:16,679
Yes, I know.
What do you want?

263
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:21,467
I'm coming home.

264
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:23,724
What are you talking about?

265
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:27,191
I just...

266
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:31,776
I want you to know that
I'm coming home for her birthday.

267
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,282
You're not coming here.

268
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,242
Listen, Beth...

269
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,997
...I gotta see you.

270
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,203
No, you listen to me.
This is my house now. I pay the rent.

271
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:51,296
You don't pay child support.

272
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:55,759
- You just can't walk in and out.
- Don't talk like that, Beth.

273
00:25:57,637 --> 00:25:59,925
I have to come home.

274
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:02,341
I have to bring her a present.

275
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,852
You know you can't come here!

276
00:26:19,197 --> 00:26:21,236
It's him! It's him, man!

277
00:26:24,076 --> 00:26:25,025
How's Adele?

278
00:26:27,037 --> 00:26:28,615
This isn't your home anymore.

279
00:26:33,543 --> 00:26:34,456
How is she?

280
00:26:36,504 --> 00:26:38,662
She's doing just fine without you.

281
00:26:41,175 --> 00:26:42,966
- Angie, get out.
- Come on, man.

282
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:46,669
It's fucking broad daylight!
This shit ain't worth it!

283
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,136
- Get the fuck out!
- Get out of the car!

284
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,217
Give me one. Give me one.

285
00:26:52,476 --> 00:26:53,306
And you?

286
00:26:54,436 --> 00:26:55,266
Don't.

287
00:26:57,773 --> 00:26:59,231
I'll call the police.

288
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:00,890
Go, go, go!

289
00:27:02,235 --> 00:27:03,349
I'm coming home.

290
00:27:06,947 --> 00:27:07,777
I'm coming home.

291
00:27:22,378 --> 00:27:24,037
Did you get him?

292
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:25,679
You missed.

293
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:42,779
I missed too.

294
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:57,126
No, don't fucking do it!

295
00:28:59,546 --> 00:29:00,826
No, man.

296
00:29:01,047 --> 00:29:01,877
Fuck you, mother!

297
00:29:06,093 --> 00:29:07,374
There, you see?

298
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,339
That's the concept.

299
00:29:19,522 --> 00:29:22,191
Take some shooting lessons, asshole!

300
00:29:44,752 --> 00:29:46,163
She's open.

301
00:29:54,344 --> 00:29:55,755
Have a seat.

302
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:57,628
Captain.

303
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,144
Did you hear?

304
00:30:05,562 --> 00:30:07,222
The drive-by shooting?

305
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:09,231
Disgusting!

306
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:12,432
You know who'll have to take
the heat again...

307
00:30:12,652 --> 00:30:15,143
...when the shit hits the fan.

308
00:30:21,243 --> 00:30:23,484
You're retiring a little early.

309
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,409
You won't be getting
your full pension.

310
00:30:26,914 --> 00:30:29,950
Yes, sir, that's right.
I won't.

311
00:30:32,628 --> 00:30:35,201
This isn't because
you were wounded, is it?

312
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:39,543
Wounded?

313
00:30:39,842 --> 00:30:41,420
Because, I mean...

314
00:30:42,303 --> 00:30:44,212
...you're behind a desk now.

315
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,636
Not much chance
of getting wounded there.

316
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:50,385
Look, captain, it has nothing
to do with that.

317
00:30:54,856 --> 00:30:56,848
I'll make my speech.

318
00:30:57,483 --> 00:30:59,890
They make me do this,
you understand.

319
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:03,311
I hate to lose a good cop.

320
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:06,860
Not too late to change your mind.

321
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:10,659
Lot of good cops want to drop
the whole kit and caboodle.

322
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,370
And who wouldn't?

323
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,824
The pay stinks...

324
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,823
...and you're up to your ears
in human scum 16 hours a day.

325
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,998
But it gets in your blood.

326
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:25,789
A lot of good cops
get to the point of...

327
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:28,249
...slapping their badge down
on this desk...

328
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:32,504
...and find they just can't do it.
How about you?

329
00:31:32,931 --> 00:31:34,923
Will you stick with the team?

330
00:31:37,726 --> 00:31:40,644
No, captain.
I don't think I will.

331
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,855
Like I say, they make me ask.
You understand.

332
00:31:50,154 --> 00:31:51,434
How are the kids?

333
00:31:52,698 --> 00:31:54,406
I don't have any.

334
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:57,318
What the hell?

335
00:31:59,162 --> 00:32:01,450
I'd like to take my stick
to these clerks.

336
00:32:02,123 --> 00:32:06,250
- The file says...
- We lost a child.

337
00:32:07,086 --> 00:32:07,915
Lost it?

338
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,747
Her. Lost her.

339
00:32:10,005 --> 00:32:12,578
Yes, of course. Her.
That's rough.

340
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:16,626
Well, it can be.
Yes, sir.

341
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,087
Still married, right?

342
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,017
Yes, sir, I am.

343
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:35,186
That's good.

344
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:45,873
Where you going?

345
00:33:46,131 --> 00:33:47,790
- I'm going home.
- Not this way.

346
00:33:48,132 --> 00:33:51,382
- Why not?
- Metrorail construction, that's why not.

347
00:33:52,094 --> 00:33:53,588
Go around.

348
00:33:54,305 --> 00:33:55,715
Just follow your tootsies.

349
00:33:56,682 --> 00:34:00,809
You sure you don't want something?
Coffee, soda, something?

350
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,969
No, thank you, ma'am.

351
00:34:04,105 --> 00:34:06,144
I feel kind of stupid about this.

352
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:08,225
Better safe than sorry.

353
00:34:08,484 --> 00:34:10,061
That's what I thought.

354
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,982
You have a restraining order
against your husband?

355
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:14,524
Ex-husband.

356
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:17,323
He'd show up on the wrong day...

357
00:34:17,575 --> 00:34:21,323
...or in the middle of the night,
pounding on the door.

358
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:24,319
Thing is, he has
this horrendous temper.

359
00:34:24,581 --> 00:34:27,535
I didn't know if a restraining
order was a good idea...

360
00:34:27,751 --> 00:34:29,873
...and if it'd do more harm than good.

361
00:34:30,253 --> 00:34:33,835
But the judge said we should
make an example of him.

362
00:34:35,049 --> 00:34:38,251
So he can't come
within 100 feet of us.

363
00:34:38,885 --> 00:34:41,802
Or is it yards?
Which is it? Feet or yards?

364
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,507
That's up to the judge.

365
00:34:43,723 --> 00:34:46,640
- I thought it was a set thing.
- It's at his discretion.

366
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,226
That's interesting.

367
00:34:48,435 --> 00:34:49,431
Does he drink?

368
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:54,262
Oh, I thought you meant the judge!

369
00:34:55,108 --> 00:34:57,314
- No, I wouldn't say so.
- Do drugs?

370
00:35:00,404 --> 00:35:02,112
But he has a propensity for violence?

371
00:35:02,614 --> 00:35:05,152
Yeah, I think you could say that.

372
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:08,657
Did he strike the little girl?

373
00:35:10,747 --> 00:35:12,406
Did he strike you?

374
00:35:13,332 --> 00:35:14,874
Not exactly.

375
00:35:16,126 --> 00:35:17,585
Not exactly?

376
00:35:20,547 --> 00:35:23,251
You know, there were times...

377
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:25,667
...when I thought he was going to...

378
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:29,342
...but I just didn't want to wait
until he got around to it.

379
00:35:34,476 --> 00:35:36,385
It's hard to explain.

380
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:41,145
He could, I think.

381
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,639
You think?

382
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:51,952
Hello, sir.
How are you today?

383
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:53,456
I'm doing all right.

384
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,704
- How about you?
- Me? I'm terrible.

385
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:56,871
I'm sorry.

386
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:01,004
I came from Santa Barbara,
and my friend wasn't home...

387
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:02,333
...and he owes me money...

388
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,634
...so I have no money to go home.

389
00:37:04,888 --> 00:37:07,675
I'm almost out of gas.
I had to sleep in my car.

390
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:10,891
Do you have a few bucks?
It would really help me out.

391
00:37:11,102 --> 00:37:13,972
Give me your address,
I'll mail it back. Honest.

392
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:17,358
- Let me see your driver's license.
- What for?

393
00:37:17,608 --> 00:37:19,565
It'll have your address on it.

394
00:37:19,776 --> 00:37:23,026
- I don't have a license.
- You drove all the way without it?

395
00:37:23,238 --> 00:37:24,483
Are you a cop?

396
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:26,945
Let's see your car registration
and your car.

397
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,066
All right, forget it.
Okay, just forget it!

398
00:37:32,412 --> 00:37:34,868
That's a hell of a way
to treat a vet, man.

399
00:37:35,957 --> 00:37:40,369
- You're an animal doctor?
- No, a veteran. I was in Nam.

400
00:37:40,878 --> 00:37:43,036
You must've been 10 years old.

401
00:37:43,255 --> 00:37:45,580
I meant to say the Gulf.

402
00:37:45,841 --> 00:37:48,794
Come on! All I'm asking for
is a little change.

403
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,845
I haven't eaten in three days.

404
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:54,428
Well, I mean, except for this.

405
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:58,674
Fuck it! Give me some money, man.
Just give me some money.

406
00:37:59,436 --> 00:38:01,761
How about a dime?
Give it to me.

407
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,355
I'm not giving you any.

408
00:38:03,606 --> 00:38:05,314
- You got a cigarette?
- No.

409
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:08,893
- You gotta give me something.
- Why don't you get a job?

410
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,526
This is my park. I live here!

411
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,947
Who are you, walking
through my park with two bags?

412
00:38:15,158 --> 00:38:17,364
I don't got any. Is that fair?

413
00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:20,619
What's in those bags, anyway?
Give me one.

414
00:38:20,872 --> 00:38:24,205
I could sell those bags
and eat for a week with the money.

415
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:27,245
You've got two of them.
Why do you need two?

416
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:29,455
You're right.

417
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:30,869
Here.

418
00:38:31,131 --> 00:38:33,835
- Are you serious?
- I don't need it anymore.

419
00:38:36,093 --> 00:38:40,221
All right! Come on, now.
Come on. What the...

420
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:46,966
Son of a bitch!

421
00:38:53,734 --> 00:38:57,067
- Can we cut the crap this time?
- I'm telling you the truth!

422
00:38:57,278 --> 00:38:58,654
Yeah, right.

423
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:05,951
- What's up?
- She was at the drive-by shooting.

424
00:39:06,245 --> 00:39:08,700
- Angie, who hit your guys?
- I told you.

425
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:12,448
We know. The big bad white man.
We're not buying it.

426
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:14,494
Who are you protecting?

427
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:18,669
They put your boyfriend in the hospital.
He's probably dead.

428
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:21,632
Do you realize that?
He's probably fucking dead!

429
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:25,128
- Stop saying that!
- You picked a good day to leave.

430
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:28,424
You want another 3-year-old
to get shot in the head?

431
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:30,133
Is that what you want?

432
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,050
Tell me the truth!

433
00:39:36,813 --> 00:39:39,102
I'm telling you the truth!

434
00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:41,306
It was a white guy!

435
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:44,900
- Why would he go after your friends?
- I don't know!

436
00:39:45,112 --> 00:39:48,979
He attacked them on Angel's Flight Hill
with a baseball bat!

437
00:39:49,241 --> 00:39:51,198
A baseball bat?
Wait!

438
00:39:52,827 --> 00:39:55,152
Baseball bat.
What did this guy look like?

439
00:39:55,997 --> 00:39:58,322
I don't know.
He looked like you...

440
00:39:58,582 --> 00:40:00,325
...except he was taller and had hair.

441
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:02,411
Good description, Angie!

442
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:04,460
Did he wear a white shirt and tie?

443
00:40:07,965 --> 00:40:09,246
Come over here, will you?

444
00:40:10,384 --> 00:40:13,669
We gotta keep the pressure on her.
Don't interrupt.

445
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:15,002
What about the bat?

446
00:40:15,264 --> 00:40:18,264
- The white shirt and tie!
- What will she think of next?

447
00:40:18,475 --> 00:40:20,467
I'm sorry you're leaving,
but you are.

448
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:24,765
- Sanchez, listen to me!
- Check me later, babe.

449
00:40:32,278 --> 00:40:34,401
Remember that storekeeper,
the Korean guy?

450
00:40:34,614 --> 00:40:36,108
- Mr. Lee?
- Come here.

451
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:38,526
Where was his place?

452
00:40:39,243 --> 00:40:40,488
Right there.

453
00:40:40,828 --> 00:40:42,903
He was assaulted
sometime after 8 a. M.?

454
00:40:43,163 --> 00:40:47,112
- About that.
- And the drive-by was here, right?

455
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:48,205
What's going on?

456
00:40:48,418 --> 00:40:52,746
I may be nuts, but Angel's Flight Hill
is between those two spots.

457
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:56,420
- It was a classy neighborhood.
- It's a shit hole. Gangland.

458
00:40:56,633 --> 00:41:01,010
I know. What would a white guy
in a shirt and tie be doing in...

459
00:41:01,304 --> 00:41:02,584
...gangland?

460
00:41:17,693 --> 00:41:18,938
Hi. Can I help you?

461
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:23,311
I'd like a ham and cheese Whamlette,
an order of Wham fries...

462
00:41:23,573 --> 00:41:26,907
Sorry, we stopped serving breakfast.
We're on the lunch menu.

463
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:28,817
I want breakfast.

464
00:41:29,078 --> 00:41:30,869
We're not serving it.

465
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,497
So you said.

466
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:35,906
Is that the manager?

467
00:41:37,586 --> 00:41:39,163
Could I speak to him, please?

468
00:41:40,338 --> 00:41:41,369
Sure.

469
00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:44,252
Rick, a customer would like
to speak to you.

470
00:41:46,844 --> 00:41:47,674
Yes, sir.

471
00:41:47,928 --> 00:41:49,552
I'd like some breakfast.

472
00:41:50,222 --> 00:41:52,214
We stopped serving breakfast.

473
00:41:52,432 --> 00:41:57,556
I know you stopped breakfast, Rick.
Sheila told me you stopped...

474
00:41:58,145 --> 00:42:00,980
Why am I calling you by first names?
I don't know you.

475
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:05,851
I call my boss "mister" after 7 years,
but I walk in here, a stranger...

476
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:10,274
...and I'm calling you Rick and Sheila
like we're in an AA meeting.

477
00:42:11,282 --> 00:42:15,149
I don't want to be your buddy, Rick.
I just want a little breakfast.

478
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:18,032
You can call me Miss Folsom
if you want to.

479
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:21,205
We stopped serving breakfast at 11:30.

480
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:36,880
Have you ever heard the expression,
"The customer is always right"?

481
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:42,142
Well, here I am.

482
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,684
The customer.

483
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,722
That's not our policy.

484
00:42:46,938 --> 00:42:50,105
You have to order something
from the lunch menu.

485
00:42:51,567 --> 00:42:53,725
I don't want lunch.

486
00:42:53,944 --> 00:42:55,319
I want breakfast.

487
00:42:55,738 --> 00:42:58,145
Yeah, well, hey,
I'm really sorry.

488
00:42:58,407 --> 00:43:00,814
Yeah, well, hey,
I'm really sorry too!

489
00:43:01,076 --> 00:43:02,404
He's got a gun!

490
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:04,574
Let's get organized!

491
00:43:05,371 --> 00:43:06,320
Calm down!

492
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,451
Just calm down, everybody.
Sit down over there!

493
00:43:10,626 --> 00:43:12,203
Mister.

494
00:43:13,545 --> 00:43:14,955
Where are you going?

495
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:18,172
No. You sit down there,
and you finish your lunch.

496
00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:22,333
Everybody just relax
and take it easy.

497
00:43:24,388 --> 00:43:26,179
Eat your lunch. Please.

498
00:43:26,389 --> 00:43:28,465
You all need your vitamins A, B and...

499
00:43:30,601 --> 00:43:32,843
Don't! It was an accident!

500
00:43:33,062 --> 00:43:36,431
It's the trigger. It's sensitive.
It's okay!

501
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:40,775
It's a sensitive trigger.

502
00:43:45,781 --> 00:43:47,192
Could I have my breakfast?

503
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,525
Yes, sir. Sheila?

504
00:43:58,042 --> 00:44:00,615
Rick? Miss Folsom?

505
00:44:01,253 --> 00:44:02,534
You know what?

506
00:44:02,796 --> 00:44:04,670
You were right.
I've changed my mind.

507
00:44:05,257 --> 00:44:07,166
I'm going to have some lunch.

508
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,753
Could I have a double
Whammyburger with cheese...

509
00:44:11,095 --> 00:44:13,301
- You getting this?
- Yes, sir.

510
00:44:13,556 --> 00:44:17,090
And an order of Whammy fries
and, let's see...

511
00:44:17,351 --> 00:44:18,893
...a Choco-Wham shake.

512
00:44:19,394 --> 00:44:21,683
Yes, sir.
Sheila, get his order.

513
00:44:22,147 --> 00:44:24,104
Rick, could you
get it for me, please?

514
00:44:25,066 --> 00:44:29,976
I feel comfortable calling you Rick
after all we've been through together.

515
00:44:35,492 --> 00:44:37,034
How you doing?

516
00:44:37,744 --> 00:44:39,570
Enjoying your meal?

517
00:44:41,956 --> 00:44:42,821
How about you?

518
00:44:43,207 --> 00:44:44,582
Is it good?

519
00:44:48,628 --> 00:44:50,502
And you, ma'am? How's the food?

520
00:44:53,132 --> 00:44:54,757
I think we have a critic.

521
00:44:57,177 --> 00:45:00,012
I don't think
she likes the special sauce.

522
00:45:01,973 --> 00:45:03,551
That's a joke.

523
00:45:04,642 --> 00:45:06,053
Now, here we go.

524
00:45:06,561 --> 00:45:07,592
Thank you.

525
00:45:11,648 --> 00:45:13,771
See, this is what I'm talking about.

526
00:45:14,443 --> 00:45:15,356
Look at that.

527
00:45:16,027 --> 00:45:16,857
See what I mean?

528
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:19,358
It's plump, juicy, three inches thick.

529
00:45:23,325 --> 00:45:27,239
Look at this sorry,
miserable, squashed thing.

530
00:45:27,996 --> 00:45:31,032
Can anybody tell me
what's wrong with this picture?

531
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,993
Anybody?

532
00:45:35,044 --> 00:45:36,704
Anybody at all.

533
00:45:47,638 --> 00:45:49,381
You guys are partners again!

534
00:45:49,598 --> 00:45:52,884
No such luck, Lita.
He's moving to Lake Havasu.

535
00:45:53,227 --> 00:45:55,896
- What's in Lake Havasu?
- London Bridge.

536
00:45:56,146 --> 00:45:59,431
- Are you going to England?
- They moved it to Arizona.

537
00:45:59,732 --> 00:46:03,017
- Stone by stone.
- Oh, yeah. I heard about that.

538
00:46:03,277 --> 00:46:06,147
You're better off,
because cops get killed.

539
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,938
- What did we used to get, six?
- Seven.

540
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:10,900
Two sevens.

541
00:46:16,038 --> 00:46:16,868
You all right?

542
00:46:20,459 --> 00:46:21,787
You sure?

543
00:46:29,342 --> 00:46:32,011
I'm sorry, I wasn't gonna do this.

544
00:46:32,261 --> 00:46:34,834
I should just shut up.
It's none of my business.

545
00:46:35,055 --> 00:46:36,549
Tell me.

546
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,591
Lake Havasu?

547
00:46:40,726 --> 00:46:42,221
It's nice. We like it.

548
00:46:42,478 --> 00:46:43,758
She likes it.

549
00:46:44,355 --> 00:46:46,146
What'll you do, watch cactus grow?

550
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:47,851
Cacti.

551
00:46:51,194 --> 00:46:53,352
She's not handling
middle age too well.

552
00:46:53,613 --> 00:46:57,361
The change of life and all that,
whatever it is that is.

553
00:46:58,742 --> 00:46:59,773
What about you?

554
00:46:59,993 --> 00:47:02,828
Me? It's different,
because she's a woman.

555
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:05,237
Different? I'm a woman.

556
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,664
But she was once very beautiful.

557
00:47:09,377 --> 00:47:10,539
Thanks a lot!

558
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:13,499
You know what I mean.
Come on, come on.

559
00:47:13,714 --> 00:47:16,287
She could've been anything.
Anything but a cop's wife.

560
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:17,581
She's high-strung.

561
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:21,798
Don't give me that queen of the hop,
homecoming-queen bullshit again.

562
00:47:22,513 --> 00:47:23,888
That was a long time ago.

563
00:47:24,765 --> 00:47:26,841
Sandra, you have a career.

564
00:47:27,309 --> 00:47:30,393
It's hard to lose your beauty
when that's all you've got.

565
00:47:30,604 --> 00:47:31,932
What about your career?

566
00:47:32,939 --> 00:47:34,563
I'll be okay...

567
00:47:34,816 --> 00:47:37,022
...you know, even without you.

568
00:47:43,281 --> 00:47:44,479
Sorry to break this up.

569
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:46,817
- Why are you here?
- We got a call.

570
00:47:47,035 --> 00:47:48,493
Watch out! Hot plates!

571
00:47:48,786 --> 00:47:51,491
- Don't touch my gun.
- Fuck you!

572
00:47:51,705 --> 00:47:55,074
You'll love this one. Some
dickhead went into Whammyburger...

573
00:47:55,334 --> 00:47:57,824
...pulled out a gun
when he couldn't get breakfast.

574
00:47:58,086 --> 00:48:00,577
Then he paid for it and left.

575
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:01,953
Sorry, Prendergast.

576
00:48:02,215 --> 00:48:03,080
He paid for it?

577
00:48:03,924 --> 00:48:05,466
Move your buns. Let's go.

578
00:48:05,676 --> 00:48:06,625
I gotta go.

579
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:08,083
Where was this?

580
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:11,055
Quintero and Fourth.
Bye, ladies.

581
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,547
Wait a minute. Wait, wait!

582
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:18,100
Let me know what this guy
was wearing, okay?

583
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:22,356
You trying to crack a big one
before you disappear into the desert?

584
00:48:22,607 --> 00:48:25,857
Sandra, find out if he's wearing
a white shirt and tie.

585
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,569
Let's go, lovebirds.

586
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,570
- I gotta go.
- Wait.

587
00:48:30,573 --> 00:48:33,277
Something about my wife.
Maybe I never mentioned it.

588
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,239
What?

589
00:48:38,955 --> 00:48:40,615
I love her.

590
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:43,539
Let's go!

591
00:49:10,942 --> 00:49:12,768
For seven years, I banked here.

592
00:49:13,027 --> 00:49:16,691
When I asked them for a loan,
a small loan...

593
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:20,902
...they told me that I was not
"economically viable."

594
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:32,415
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

595
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:35,456
How'd your loan work out?
Did they give you a loan?

596
00:49:36,798 --> 00:49:38,624
He must be economically viable!

597
00:49:38,883 --> 00:49:41,967
There's a man with a smiling face.
A happy customer.

598
00:49:42,302 --> 00:49:45,885
That's what an economically
viable person looks like!

599
00:49:57,858 --> 00:49:59,435
How much is the...?

600
00:49:59,901 --> 00:50:01,728
That is only $3.

601
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:09,074
I asked them for a small loan.
You know what they told me?

602
00:50:09,326 --> 00:50:11,864
I was not economically viable.

603
00:50:13,204 --> 00:50:14,118
That's enough.

604
00:50:15,248 --> 00:50:18,414
- I'll buy this.
- Yes, sir. That is $3.

605
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:30,376
I'm going away now!
I'm going away, everybody!

606
00:50:30,595 --> 00:50:35,505
This is what happens
if you're not economically viable!

607
00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:48,060
Don't let this happen to you!

608
00:50:49,236 --> 00:50:50,611
Bye, everybody!

609
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:56,864
Don't forget me.

610
00:51:17,094 --> 00:51:18,256
I'm sorry.

611
00:51:19,805 --> 00:51:20,884
We're leaving now.

612
00:51:21,431 --> 00:51:22,629
You are? Really?

613
00:51:22,849 --> 00:51:25,600
It doesn't look like
your husband's gonna show.

614
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:30,679
He probably realized he could get
into trouble if he harassed you.

615
00:51:31,023 --> 00:51:34,107
You should call your lawyer
and tell him about it.

616
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:37,900
It's one of those services.
I didn't have much money.

617
00:51:38,154 --> 00:51:42,103
Have them call your husband's lawyer,
make it official.

618
00:51:42,658 --> 00:51:47,236
In the meantime, lock up.
And if anything else happens, call us.

619
00:51:47,454 --> 00:51:49,944
- Okay, thanks.
- Sure thing.

620
00:52:03,927 --> 00:52:06,382
Excuse me. Hey, excuse me!

621
00:52:06,721 --> 00:52:10,635
If you haven't noticed,
others are waiting to use the phone.

622
00:52:11,058 --> 00:52:13,346
- Others want the phone?
- Right, asshole!

623
00:52:13,685 --> 00:52:16,851
Jeez, that's too bad,
because you know what?

624
00:52:22,484 --> 00:52:24,560
I think it's out of order.

625
00:52:35,621 --> 00:52:36,783
Hi, it's me.

626
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:39,446
He's eating and resting
comfortably now.

627
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:40,864
- Who is?
- Mr. Peepers.

628
00:52:41,084 --> 00:52:42,958
- Good!
- I'm sorry about before.

629
00:52:43,336 --> 00:52:45,245
I really blew my top...

630
00:52:45,505 --> 00:52:48,375
That's okay, honey.
Could you hold on one second?

631
00:52:49,842 --> 00:52:50,837
White shirt and tie.

632
00:52:51,093 --> 00:52:52,291
Could you hold on?

633
00:52:52,553 --> 00:52:53,632
I gotta go.

634
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,804
Just one second.
It's very important.

635
00:52:57,473 --> 00:53:00,011
Detective Torres!
Excuse me.

636
00:53:00,268 --> 00:53:03,601
We have about 7 million people
waiting to make a statement.

637
00:53:04,897 --> 00:53:06,355
Let me call you right back.

638
00:53:06,606 --> 00:53:08,314
What's wrong?
What are you doing?

639
00:53:08,567 --> 00:53:11,353
Nothing's wrong.
What do you mean?

640
00:53:11,778 --> 00:53:14,150
- You come home then.
- I can't.

641
00:53:14,405 --> 00:53:17,441
It's your last day.
What are they going to do, fire you?

642
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:21,234
There's a lot of red tape.
As soon as I get done, I can go home.

643
00:53:21,453 --> 00:53:23,611
I'll call you in a while, okay?

644
00:53:23,872 --> 00:53:25,911
Wait a minute. Make a list.

645
00:53:26,165 --> 00:53:28,537
- A list?
- We need boneless chicken...

646
00:53:28,793 --> 00:53:30,168
...skinless. Red peppers...

647
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:31,961
...not green, red.

648
00:53:32,171 --> 00:53:34,080
Honey, hold on one second.

649
00:53:35,173 --> 00:53:37,000
I am tying up the phone here.

650
00:53:37,383 --> 00:53:39,839
Just listen for once in your life.

651
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,756
A girl at the drive-by said
a man in a shirt and tie...

652
00:53:44,014 --> 00:53:46,931
...attacked her homeboys
with a baseball bat.

653
00:53:47,142 --> 00:53:49,218
Somebody's let that dog off the leash.

654
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:51,888
I think you've got last-day-itis.

655
00:53:52,105 --> 00:53:56,600
This man was not swinging a bat.
He has a gym bag full of guns.

656
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:58,776
A gym bag?

657
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,529
You asked me to tell you
what he wore. I gotta run.

658
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,488
We have to canvas the neighborhood.

659
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,235
One more second.

660
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,909
Please. It's important.

661
00:54:09,286 --> 00:54:11,658
- Why don't you go to the store?
- Why?

662
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:13,372
It's my last day.

663
00:54:13,624 --> 00:54:16,541
The guys might want to have
a send off or something.

664
00:54:16,793 --> 00:54:18,951
What're they gonna do?
Get some broad...

665
00:54:19,212 --> 00:54:21,963
...with tassels dangling,
dancing on your desk?

666
00:54:22,173 --> 00:54:23,916
Course not.

667
00:54:24,341 --> 00:54:27,128
Look, while you have
been playing cop...

668
00:54:27,344 --> 00:54:29,917
...I'm at home
planning your retirement.

669
00:54:30,138 --> 00:54:32,925
It's over. The sooner
you get that, the better.

670
00:54:33,725 --> 00:54:37,140
You are no longer
in the law-enforcement business.

671
00:54:37,394 --> 00:54:40,728
Now, I will expect you
at the usual time. Capito?

672
00:54:42,482 --> 00:54:45,187
Sandra, are you mad at me?

673
00:54:46,236 --> 00:54:48,809
- I hate you, but I'm not mad.
- You retiring too?

674
00:54:53,534 --> 00:54:56,320
Just don't leave
without saying goodbye.

675
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,900
Goodbye.

676
00:54:58,288 --> 00:55:00,778
If you go up against this guy...

677
00:55:01,582 --> 00:55:02,412
...be careful.

678
00:56:27,658 --> 00:56:29,152
I'm Nick.

679
00:56:30,452 --> 00:56:32,160
What can I do you for?

680
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:34,528
I'm just looking for
some hiking boots.

681
00:56:34,789 --> 00:56:37,458
Well, well. Hiking boots, huh?

682
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:40,033
Let's see what we got.

683
00:56:40,252 --> 00:56:41,960
These are the top of the line.

684
00:56:42,171 --> 00:56:45,088
Scientifically engineered
and all that crap.

685
00:56:45,298 --> 00:56:48,833
Guaranteed by some Sierra Club
asshole not to hurt a chipmunk...

686
00:56:49,052 --> 00:56:50,878
...if you step on it.

687
00:56:51,095 --> 00:56:53,882
Personally, I think they're
for pussies and faggots!

688
00:56:55,307 --> 00:56:56,849
Now these...

689
00:56:57,309 --> 00:56:59,052
...are Vietnam jungle boots.

690
00:56:59,686 --> 00:57:03,101
Cost half as much,
last twice as long and are great...

691
00:57:03,356 --> 00:57:05,313
...for stomping queers!

692
00:57:05,524 --> 00:57:09,604
When you're done, you gotta
clean out the waffle with a stick...

693
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:12,352
...but you can't
have everything, right?

694
00:57:13,406 --> 00:57:14,817
Forget it.

695
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:17,230
Come on, let's go.

696
00:57:17,493 --> 00:57:20,031
Have a nice day, fellas!

697
00:57:20,287 --> 00:57:22,612
Y'all come back now, you hear?

698
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:24,784
You got a problem, buddy?

699
00:57:29,587 --> 00:57:30,702
You got the problem!

700
00:57:30,922 --> 00:57:33,412
- No, you do, buddy!
- Read the sign!

701
00:57:33,674 --> 00:57:35,548
"I reserve the right."

702
00:57:36,385 --> 00:57:37,665
Now take a hike.

703
00:57:38,136 --> 00:57:39,630
Make me.

704
00:57:40,972 --> 00:57:44,423
Take it easy, Mary.
Take it easy.

705
00:57:45,393 --> 00:57:48,097
- Jesus!
- Come on, make your play.

706
00:57:48,395 --> 00:57:51,930
Would you just come on!
I don't need this shit today.

707
00:57:53,024 --> 00:57:54,305
Fucking redneck!

708
00:57:55,944 --> 00:57:57,224
Fascist!

709
00:58:01,407 --> 00:58:03,695
Fucking faggots!

710
00:58:03,909 --> 00:58:05,735
You believe this shit?

711
00:58:07,162 --> 00:58:09,035
Jesus!

712
00:58:09,706 --> 00:58:12,576
Alternate lifestyle, my ass!

713
00:58:13,834 --> 00:58:17,417
Imagine what those pumpkins do
with each other when they're alone!

714
00:58:17,796 --> 00:58:21,627
And what about the muff divers?
Think about it.

715
00:58:24,927 --> 00:58:25,841
Sergeant Prendergast.

716
00:58:26,095 --> 00:58:27,293
She don't have to talk!

717
00:58:28,722 --> 00:58:31,343
What do you want?
I admitted it was a gang!

718
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,343
She don't have to say a word!

719
00:58:33,727 --> 00:58:38,435
I know it was a white guy.
We gotta talk. It's important.

720
00:58:41,108 --> 00:58:44,311
How many guns were in the gym bag?

721
00:58:44,569 --> 00:58:48,152
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't see no gym bag!

722
00:58:48,698 --> 00:58:51,901
The white guy took it, right?
More people could get hurt.

723
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:53,653
Now help me out.

724
00:58:56,038 --> 00:58:58,908
The bag was already in the car
when I got in.

725
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:00,624
How many guns were in it?

726
00:59:00,834 --> 00:59:02,292
I don't know.

727
00:59:04,295 --> 00:59:06,169
Lots of guns.

728
00:59:06,589 --> 00:59:08,914
They got all the guns
in the fucking world.

729
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:34,685
Good?

730
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,073
Can I help you?

731
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,569
Police officer.
I'm looking for a man.

732
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,788
Are you now?

733
00:59:46,832 --> 00:59:47,828
Late 30s...

734
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:49,573
...white shirt and tie...

735
00:59:50,544 --> 00:59:52,667
...he'd be carrying a gym bag.

736
00:59:58,509 --> 01:00:00,134
What's the police scanner for?

737
01:00:01,012 --> 01:00:02,755
My own personal amusement.

738
01:00:04,389 --> 01:00:06,346
Seen anyone like I've described?

739
01:00:06,725 --> 01:00:07,590
Nope.

740
01:00:08,351 --> 01:00:10,391
- Okay, thanks.
- Listen.

741
01:00:10,645 --> 01:00:12,472
Tell me something.

742
01:00:12,897 --> 01:00:15,055
Why don't they call you guys...

743
01:00:15,274 --> 01:00:17,646
...officer-esses?

744
01:00:18,193 --> 01:00:19,308
I beg your pardon?

745
01:00:19,528 --> 01:00:23,525
You know, like actress?
Like that?

746
01:00:25,825 --> 01:00:28,031
Something to signify...

747
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:30,614
...you know.

748
01:00:33,081 --> 01:00:36,865
I guess they feel that a police officer
is a police officer...

749
01:00:37,085 --> 01:00:38,828
...not a...

750
01:00:39,837 --> 01:00:41,248
..."you know."

751
01:00:42,715 --> 01:00:44,672
Thanks for your cooperation, sir.

752
01:00:44,883 --> 01:00:48,299
Sorry I couldn't be of
more help, officer-ess.

753
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:58,765
Why'd you do that?

754
01:00:59,396 --> 01:01:01,638
There's something I wanna show you.

755
01:01:02,565 --> 01:01:05,981
I'm not gonna turn you in.
I'm your friend.

756
01:01:06,903 --> 01:01:08,147
Come on.

757
01:01:09,447 --> 01:01:11,854
I don't bring just anybody back here.

758
01:01:12,074 --> 01:01:14,825
This is my own private stash.

759
01:01:15,535 --> 01:01:17,943
I got some great stuff here.

760
01:01:24,001 --> 01:01:25,993
World War I. Good shape.

761
01:01:27,379 --> 01:01:29,751
Speaking of gas, wait a minute.

762
01:01:30,006 --> 01:01:31,915
Wait just a minute.

763
01:01:42,017 --> 01:01:44,009
You know what was in this?

764
01:01:44,477 --> 01:01:46,137
Zyklon-B.

765
01:01:47,146 --> 01:01:48,391
You remember?

766
01:01:48,606 --> 01:01:49,768
What the Nazis had?

767
01:01:52,234 --> 01:01:53,313
Listen.

768
01:01:56,404 --> 01:01:57,435
Empty.

769
01:01:58,031 --> 01:01:59,406
This was used, man.

770
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:03,200
This was actually used.

771
01:02:03,869 --> 01:02:08,198
I wonder how many kikes
this little can took out.

772
01:02:09,082 --> 01:02:11,787
Think about it. Here.

773
01:02:17,673 --> 01:02:19,879
Why are you showing me this?

774
01:02:20,509 --> 01:02:21,339
I'm not.

775
01:02:22,677 --> 01:02:25,512
That's just for fun.
You can keep that.

776
01:02:28,391 --> 01:02:30,964
This is what I want to show you.

777
01:02:31,769 --> 01:02:33,678
The real thing.

778
01:02:34,896 --> 01:02:38,063
Heat-seeking, shoulder-fired.
It's fucking disposable!

779
01:02:38,274 --> 01:02:40,943
You can take out a jet
with one of these monkeys.

780
01:02:42,987 --> 01:02:44,695
It's for you.

781
01:02:44,905 --> 01:02:46,981
I want you to have it.

782
01:02:47,533 --> 01:02:48,362
Why?

783
01:02:48,909 --> 01:02:50,735
Because I'm with you.

784
01:02:51,161 --> 01:02:52,441
Don't you get it?

785
01:02:52,704 --> 01:02:55,657
I listened to the scanner.
I heard about Whammyburger.

786
01:02:55,915 --> 01:02:58,619
Fucking fantastic!

787
01:02:58,834 --> 01:03:03,246
It's a bunch of niggers, right?
On TV, it's always white kids.

788
01:03:03,463 --> 01:03:06,914
But when you go in there,
it's nothing but a bunch of niggers!

789
01:03:07,425 --> 01:03:10,094
They'll spit on your food
if you're not nice.

790
01:03:10,302 --> 01:03:12,342
I know all about it.

791
01:03:13,972 --> 01:03:15,383
I'm with you.

792
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:18,006
We're the same, you and me.

793
01:03:18,226 --> 01:03:19,969
We're the same. Don't you see?

794
01:03:20,186 --> 01:03:22,641
We are not the same.

795
01:03:22,939 --> 01:03:25,690
I'm an American.
You're a sick asshole.

796
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,103
What kind of vigilante are you?

797
01:03:30,445 --> 01:03:33,150
I am not a vigilante.

798
01:03:33,364 --> 01:03:36,697
I'm just trying to get home
for my little girl's birthday.

799
01:03:36,993 --> 01:03:42,033
And if everybody will stay
out of my way, nobody will get hurt.

800
01:03:42,831 --> 01:03:44,242
Fuck you!

801
01:03:44,499 --> 01:03:47,250
Who the fuck are you?
Are you fucking with me?

802
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,129
I am just disagreeing with you!

803
01:03:50,338 --> 01:03:54,631
In America, we have freedom of speech,
the right to disagree!

804
01:03:54,967 --> 01:03:56,876
Fuck you and your freedom!

805
01:03:57,094 --> 01:03:58,753
Who the fuck are you?

806
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:01,093
You fuck!
You faggot fuck!

807
01:04:01,306 --> 01:04:02,716
Gonna take my rocket.

808
01:04:02,932 --> 01:04:06,466
I ought to shoot you, motherfucker!
Now turn around!

809
01:04:06,727 --> 01:04:09,300
Now lean on that counter!
Go on, lean on it!

810
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:17,899
Look at this shit!

811
01:04:21,323 --> 01:04:23,529
What is this doing in there?

812
01:04:23,742 --> 01:04:25,818
Faggot shit!

813
01:04:28,204 --> 01:04:32,153
You want freedom, huh?
I'll give you fucking freedom!

814
01:04:32,374 --> 01:04:35,043
Further back.
Feet farther back.

815
01:04:35,669 --> 01:04:37,994
Spread them out.
Farther.

816
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:42,088
You're going to jail, motherfucker!
How's that for freedom?

817
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:45,384
Freedom to get fucked up the ass
by some big buck nigger.

818
01:04:45,636 --> 01:04:46,881
Give me your hand.

819
01:04:50,974 --> 01:04:55,351
He's gonna be right behind you,
just like this.

820
01:04:56,562 --> 01:04:59,765
Think about it.
You gonna like that, faggot?

821
01:05:00,024 --> 01:05:04,021
You gonna like that, you faggot fuck?
Give me your other hand.

822
01:05:04,403 --> 01:05:06,276
- I can't.
- Why not?

823
01:05:06,488 --> 01:05:07,436
Gravity.

824
01:05:07,655 --> 01:05:10,027
Gravity?
What the fuck does that mean?

825
01:05:10,241 --> 01:05:11,818
I'll fall down.

826
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:16,949
Now give me your other hand!
Give it to me now!

827
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,454
Give it to me! Give it to me!

828
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:20,864
Come on. Come on.

829
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,828
Give it to me.

830
01:05:42,728 --> 01:05:44,436
This isn't one of mine.

831
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:02,617
Oh, my God!

832
01:06:02,829 --> 01:06:04,738
Oh, my God!

833
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,037
Good!

834
01:06:07,666 --> 01:06:08,995
Freedom of religion.

835
01:06:09,668 --> 01:06:10,996
Now you get the swing of it!

836
01:06:11,837 --> 01:06:13,912
Feels good to exercise your rights.

837
01:06:26,975 --> 01:06:28,089
I'm listening.

838
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:31,014
We got a nutcase
with a bag full of guns.

839
01:06:31,229 --> 01:06:33,766
He's in Hollywood, heading west.

840
01:06:33,981 --> 01:06:35,144
What is he up to?

841
01:06:35,399 --> 01:06:37,522
He's up to a lot of trouble.

842
01:06:37,734 --> 01:06:41,434
Never mind, we've got
a hallway full of suspects.

843
01:06:41,654 --> 01:06:44,323
It wasn't a gang thing.
I can tell you that.

844
01:06:44,574 --> 01:06:46,649
Angelina is a tramp and a liar.

845
01:06:46,909 --> 01:06:50,278
We don't appreciate you interfering
with our investigation.

846
01:06:50,537 --> 01:06:54,831
I've got a positive I.D.
On the gym bag, okay?

847
01:06:57,377 --> 01:06:58,787
What's this?

848
01:06:59,003 --> 01:07:00,283
A gym bag.

849
01:07:00,504 --> 01:07:03,588
Does this mean you're
putting me under arrest?

850
01:07:06,134 --> 01:07:07,961
You guys take off.

851
01:07:11,472 --> 01:07:13,963
I gave you that speech earlier...

852
01:07:14,225 --> 01:07:17,676
...because that's regulations.
They make me do it.

853
01:07:18,061 --> 01:07:20,682
This one's from me.
I've never liked you.

854
01:07:20,897 --> 01:07:24,977
You know why? You don't curse.
I don't trust a man who doesn't curse.

855
01:07:25,234 --> 01:07:29,896
Not a "fuck" or a "shit" in all
these years. Real men curse.

856
01:07:30,322 --> 01:07:33,276
And I don't like a man
who's afraid to hit the street.

857
01:07:33,492 --> 01:07:36,029
- It's bad for morale.
- I'm not afraid.

858
01:07:36,369 --> 01:07:38,611
Get back behind that desk
where you belong...

859
01:07:38,913 --> 01:07:42,780
...and don't waste any more of my time
pretending you're a cop.

860
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:53,299
A man in a white shirt and tie shot up
a phone booth near the Whammyburger.

861
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:56,964
- Did you hear me?
- I heard you.

862
01:07:57,805 --> 01:07:59,927
Right about here, right?

863
01:08:00,265 --> 01:08:01,807
How did you know?

864
01:08:02,058 --> 01:08:04,264
He got the bag of guns
at the drive-by.

865
01:08:04,477 --> 01:08:05,805
Then you were right.

866
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:07,218
Excuse me.

867
01:08:07,438 --> 01:08:10,059
- What is wrong with you?
- Me?

868
01:08:10,274 --> 01:08:13,191
I'm a coward, the captain told me.
Get out of my way.

869
01:08:13,402 --> 01:08:15,358
Hey, look. It is your own fault.

870
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:18,525
You let everybody think that,
when it was your wife.

871
01:08:19,115 --> 01:08:20,823
She made you get off the street.

872
01:08:21,075 --> 01:08:25,203
What happens between me and my wife
is nobody's business but mine!

873
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:27,620
Sorry, I've been a bitch all day.

874
01:08:27,831 --> 01:08:30,785
She didn't make me quit.
I came home late one night...

875
01:08:31,042 --> 01:08:33,118
...and found her sitting in the dark.

876
01:08:33,377 --> 01:08:35,037
She thought I'd been killed.

877
01:08:35,296 --> 01:08:38,830
She thought I was a ghost.
I had to chase her all over the house.

878
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:44,083
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

879
01:08:44,804 --> 01:08:47,970
- Where are you going?
- See if I can earn my last day's pay.

880
01:08:48,265 --> 01:08:49,925
Let me go with you.

881
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:53,052
I thought you were on duty.

882
01:08:56,064 --> 01:08:57,855
What do you say, partner?

883
01:09:00,234 --> 01:09:01,349
Fuck them!

884
01:09:03,946 --> 01:09:05,025
Go!

885
01:09:19,543 --> 01:09:22,247
Who were you talking to a while ago?

886
01:09:25,173 --> 01:09:26,667
You're trying to scare me.

887
01:09:28,467 --> 01:09:29,416
Am I succeeding?

888
01:09:29,635 --> 01:09:33,502
No, you're not succeeding.
So you just might as well stop it.

889
01:09:34,556 --> 01:09:37,426
And you're not scaring me
out of my own house.

890
01:09:37,642 --> 01:09:38,887
And you're not coming here.

891
01:09:39,102 --> 01:09:43,728
But I am. I'm on my way.
You can count on that.

892
01:09:45,816 --> 01:09:48,520
I'm past the point of no return.

893
01:09:50,195 --> 01:09:52,068
Do you know when that is?

894
01:09:53,197 --> 01:09:55,902
That's the point in a journey...

895
01:09:56,117 --> 01:09:59,034
...where it's longer to go back
to the beginning...

896
01:09:59,286 --> 01:10:01,955
...than it is to continue
to the end.

897
01:10:03,498 --> 01:10:04,992
It's like...

898
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:07,991
Remember when those
astronauts got in trouble?

899
01:10:08,211 --> 01:10:11,875
They were going to the moon
and something went wrong.

900
01:10:12,131 --> 01:10:13,625
They had to get back to Earth...

901
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,174
...but they had passed
the point of no return.

902
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:22,340
So they had to go all the way
around the moon to get back...

903
01:10:22,556 --> 01:10:26,767
...and they were
out of contact for hours.

904
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:31,769
Everybody waited to see
if a bunch of dead guys in a can...

905
01:10:31,981 --> 01:10:34,188
...would pop out the other side.

906
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:39,612
That's me.

907
01:10:41,156 --> 01:10:43,563
On the other side of the moon now...

908
01:10:43,992 --> 01:10:46,068
...out of contact...

909
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,987
...and everybody's just going
to have to wait till I pop out.

910
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:55,875
The police are here.

911
01:10:57,837 --> 01:10:59,331
Did you know, Beth...

912
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:03,836
...that in certain South American
countries it's still legal...

913
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,797
...to kill your wife
if she insults you?

914
01:11:10,056 --> 01:11:13,010
They're here right now.
I'm looking at one right now.

915
01:11:13,685 --> 01:11:14,764
Put him on the phone.

916
01:11:32,034 --> 01:11:35,284
- What are we gonna do?
- Talk to the Korean guy.

917
01:11:36,621 --> 01:11:39,242
Then we just start banging on doors.

918
01:11:51,426 --> 01:11:52,801
What is it?

919
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:58,423
Where are you going?

920
01:11:58,641 --> 01:12:00,301
I'll be right back.

921
01:12:02,269 --> 01:12:05,720
I'm sure the guy will
let you use his bathroom.

922
01:12:19,242 --> 01:12:21,234
Prendergast, what are you doing?

923
01:12:32,587 --> 01:12:33,867
I know who this guy is!

924
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:34,960
Who is he?

925
01:12:36,007 --> 01:12:39,340
He had a personalized license plate.
What the hell was it?

926
01:12:39,552 --> 01:12:41,674
It said, "D-Fens."

927
01:12:42,221 --> 01:12:43,050
Defense?

928
01:12:43,722 --> 01:12:47,304
D-dash-F-E-N-S.
"D-Fens."

929
01:12:47,684 --> 01:12:51,348
They said he was on his way home.
Go check out his address.

930
01:12:52,021 --> 01:12:52,886
Mr. Lee!

931
01:12:54,398 --> 01:12:55,940
Defense!

932
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:25,215
Hold it! Back up.

933
01:13:29,012 --> 01:13:32,096
You dumb bitch! You cut me off!
What's wrong with you!

934
01:13:32,306 --> 01:13:33,966
Move back! Out of the way!

935
01:13:34,183 --> 01:13:35,641
What are you, a moron?

936
01:13:35,893 --> 01:13:40,803
If I wanted to be in a parking lot,
I'd buy a ticket, you dumb bitch!

937
01:14:00,289 --> 01:14:02,198
You can't come this way.

938
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:04,037
What are you doing?

939
01:14:04,459 --> 01:14:06,701
Fixing the street!
What does it look like?

940
01:14:08,379 --> 01:14:10,253
Two days ago, it was fine.

941
01:14:10,506 --> 01:14:12,712
You're saying
it fell apart in two days?

942
01:14:13,217 --> 01:14:15,091
Well, I guess so.

943
01:14:16,637 --> 01:14:18,047
Pardon me, but that's bullshit!

944
01:14:18,847 --> 01:14:22,298
I don't think anything's
wrong with the street.

945
01:14:22,559 --> 01:14:24,681
You're trying
to justify your budgets.

946
01:14:24,894 --> 01:14:26,767
- Are you nuts?
- I know how it works.

947
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:31,228
If you don't spend your budget,
you won't get any money next year.

948
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:34,520
I want you to admit
nothing's wrong with the street!

949
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:36,148
Fuck you, pal!

950
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:41,280
You're not gonna hold us hostage with
these yellow lights and big trucks.

951
01:14:43,202 --> 01:14:46,368
I'm just here to keep people
from falling in. That's all.

952
01:14:46,788 --> 01:14:48,781
I want to hear it from you.

953
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:51,908
What's wrong with the street?

954
01:14:52,126 --> 01:14:55,495
I don't know. I really don't.
I think it's a sewer job.

955
01:14:56,755 --> 01:14:58,380
You're lying.

956
01:14:58,882 --> 01:15:00,958
What's wrong with the street?

957
01:15:03,428 --> 01:15:04,341
Nothing.

958
01:15:06,806 --> 01:15:08,134
I knew it.

959
01:15:08,349 --> 01:15:10,839
See, I knew it was fine.

960
01:15:12,519 --> 01:15:14,642
But I'll give you something to fix.

961
01:15:15,647 --> 01:15:16,975
- Oh, Jesus...
- Here!

962
01:15:18,357 --> 01:15:20,765
Hey, Charlie!
Oh, please, man!

963
01:15:21,027 --> 01:15:23,066
We got a goddamn nut here!

964
01:15:25,155 --> 01:15:27,397
Fucking guy back there with a bazooka!

965
01:15:27,616 --> 01:15:28,647
Pull that thing off.

966
01:15:28,908 --> 01:15:30,071
- What thing?
- That.

967
01:15:30,326 --> 01:15:32,899
Then pull on both ends.
It gets bigger.

968
01:15:34,038 --> 01:15:35,117
Like this?

969
01:15:35,331 --> 01:15:38,201
Now flip that thing up.
It's your aimer.

970
01:15:38,584 --> 01:15:39,413
How do you know?

971
01:15:39,626 --> 01:15:41,417
I saw it on TV.

972
01:15:41,628 --> 01:15:43,585
What's the name of the movie?

973
01:15:43,838 --> 01:15:45,914
What's the movie you're making?

974
01:15:47,633 --> 01:15:49,590
Under Construction. You like it?

975
01:15:49,843 --> 01:15:52,002
It's all right.
Where's the cameras?

976
01:15:52,387 --> 01:15:55,092
The cameras are on.
Just stand back.

977
01:15:57,225 --> 01:15:58,849
What do I do now?

978
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:03,306
Just look through the aimer.
What you aiming at?

979
01:16:05,149 --> 01:16:07,188
That yellow monster down there.

980
01:16:08,109 --> 01:16:10,861
Look at it and pull the trigger.
It's really easy.

981
01:16:11,946 --> 01:16:12,776
Trigger?

982
01:16:14,073 --> 01:16:16,149
That one right there.

983
01:16:16,742 --> 01:16:18,865
But aim first, man.

984
01:16:20,203 --> 01:16:21,579
Look out!

985
01:16:27,376 --> 01:16:31,160
- Nothing happened.
- Must have been a dud or something.

986
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:44,719
Cool, man!

987
01:16:56,068 --> 01:16:57,527
What is it?
I'll sic the dog on you!

988
01:16:58,112 --> 01:16:59,938
Police officers, ma'am.

989
01:17:12,082 --> 01:17:13,493
How are you?

990
01:17:14,084 --> 01:17:15,827
Where's the dog?

991
01:17:19,339 --> 01:17:20,998
He's dead.

992
01:17:22,758 --> 01:17:26,209
- What is it?
- We need to ask you some questions.

993
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,796
Just a few questions, ma'am.

994
01:17:29,014 --> 01:17:30,923
What kind of questions?

995
01:17:31,141 --> 01:17:32,932
Do you have a warrant?

996
01:17:33,142 --> 01:17:34,636
You invited us in.

997
01:17:34,852 --> 01:17:37,177
Now I'm inviting you out.

998
01:17:37,438 --> 01:17:39,845
What relation are you
to William Foster?

999
01:17:40,065 --> 01:17:44,193
What are you saying? He's my son.
I don't want you here.

1000
01:17:44,402 --> 01:17:47,687
Would you look at this?
This is really amazing.

1001
01:17:47,905 --> 01:17:48,771
Amazing!

1002
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:52,898
Does he have another house,
another place he might call home?

1003
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,618
Now this is a what?

1004
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,862
- A dragon?
- Don't touch that!

1005
01:17:58,998 --> 01:18:01,240
Why would he do that?
This is his home.

1006
01:18:01,459 --> 01:18:04,412
- I want you to go now.
- Did this one melt?

1007
01:18:05,254 --> 01:18:06,452
That one.

1008
01:18:11,259 --> 01:18:14,176
It's a giraffe, drinking.

1009
01:18:17,515 --> 01:18:20,634
Now, of all of these,
which is your very favorite?

1010
01:18:24,771 --> 01:18:26,929
Right now, I think this skunk.

1011
01:18:27,190 --> 01:18:28,767
That's lovely.

1012
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:31,063
That's not paint.

1013
01:18:31,652 --> 01:18:32,932
You know, his stripe.

1014
01:18:33,195 --> 01:18:34,108
It isn't?

1015
01:18:34,363 --> 01:18:36,853
It might be,
but it's not painted on.

1016
01:18:37,699 --> 01:18:39,940
It's in the glass.

1017
01:19:22,196 --> 01:19:23,987
What the hell?

1018
01:19:25,950 --> 01:19:26,945
It's the groundskeeper.

1019
01:19:27,201 --> 01:19:30,569
Well, if he is, he's out of uniform.
Hey, you there!

1020
01:19:31,204 --> 01:19:33,113
What are you doing there?

1021
01:19:33,706 --> 01:19:34,869
Just passing through.

1022
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:39,075
Nobody said you could play through.
Get off my hole.

1023
01:19:39,295 --> 01:19:41,501
He said he was passing through.

1024
01:19:41,713 --> 01:19:43,706
He's not a member.
Look how he's dressed.

1025
01:19:43,924 --> 01:19:45,631
Get off my golf course!

1026
01:19:46,551 --> 01:19:47,749
I am!

1027
01:19:47,969 --> 01:19:49,795
Go back the way you came!

1028
01:19:50,179 --> 01:19:52,586
I don't like his looks.
Leave him alone.

1029
01:19:52,806 --> 01:19:55,475
What am I paying dues for?
This is my golf course!

1030
01:19:55,684 --> 01:19:58,257
If I want to play here, I will!

1031
01:19:58,478 --> 01:20:01,395
If he gets hit with my Titleist,
that's his problem!

1032
01:20:01,606 --> 01:20:04,357
Don't yell at me.
I'm just here playing with you...

1033
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,276
Fore!

1034
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:08,685
Fore!

1035
01:20:15,618 --> 01:20:16,448
Five!

1036
01:20:17,161 --> 01:20:18,110
Wait a minute!

1037
01:20:18,329 --> 01:20:22,160
What the hell you trying to do?
Kill me with a golf ball?

1038
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:25,583
It's not enough you got all
this land for your little game?

1039
01:20:25,919 --> 01:20:28,492
But you had to kill me
with a golf ball?

1040
01:20:29,172 --> 01:20:32,789
You should have children playing here.
Family picnics.

1041
01:20:33,008 --> 01:20:35,001
You should have a petting zoo...

1042
01:20:35,844 --> 01:20:40,552
...instead of electric carts for you
old men with nothing better to do.

1043
01:20:46,812 --> 01:20:49,729
Frank, what's wrong? Frank!

1044
01:20:51,149 --> 01:20:53,438
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1045
01:20:53,651 --> 01:20:56,735
- I gotta get some help!
- What's wrong with you?

1046
01:20:56,988 --> 01:20:59,027
- Help!
- Your heart?

1047
01:20:59,281 --> 01:21:02,152
Something's wrong with your heart?
What can I do?

1048
01:21:03,785 --> 01:21:05,493
Pills! Pills!

1049
01:21:05,787 --> 01:21:06,617
Pills?

1050
01:21:07,455 --> 01:21:08,486
Where are they?

1051
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:10,832
Cart, cart.

1052
01:21:13,169 --> 01:21:17,082
Call the paramedics!
My friend just had a heart attack!

1053
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:21,206
I guess you're out of luck.
Your little cart's gonna drown.

1054
01:21:21,801 --> 01:21:25,383
Aren't you sorry you didn't let me
pass through your golf course?

1055
01:21:27,848 --> 01:21:32,675
Now you're gonna die wearing that
stupid little hat. How does it feel?

1056
01:21:36,397 --> 01:21:38,722
This is his room.

1057
01:21:39,317 --> 01:21:41,475
You're a very neat and tidy lady.

1058
01:21:41,735 --> 01:21:44,273
He cleans his own room.

1059
01:21:44,946 --> 01:21:46,939
Now don't make me call you a liar.

1060
01:21:47,782 --> 01:21:52,242
If he wasn't at work,
I'd be afraid to set foot in here.

1061
01:21:52,453 --> 01:21:54,113
What's he been doing lately?

1062
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:55,788
Same as ever.

1063
01:21:55,998 --> 01:21:59,781
Building important things to
protect us from the Communists.

1064
01:22:00,710 --> 01:22:02,169
He works at Notec.

1065
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:04,378
The defense plant.

1066
01:22:05,006 --> 01:22:06,548
D-Fens.

1067
01:22:07,716 --> 01:22:09,756
Call Notec and see if you can get him.

1068
01:22:14,264 --> 01:22:16,470
So what's going on with your son?

1069
01:22:19,644 --> 01:22:22,514
- How do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

1070
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:30,856
Sometimes he sits through
an entire meal without saying a word.

1071
01:22:34,281 --> 01:22:37,317
He just shovels food into
his mouth like a machine.

1072
01:22:37,576 --> 01:22:39,615
I get so nervous...

1073
01:22:40,537 --> 01:22:42,328
...I can't swallow.

1074
01:22:42,831 --> 01:22:46,281
I'll sit there with
the same piece of food in my mouth.

1075
01:22:47,626 --> 01:22:50,627
I have to spit it out.
When I do, he looks at me...

1076
01:22:50,838 --> 01:22:53,375
...like he'd like to kill me.

1077
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:57,210
Don't tell him I said that.

1078
01:22:57,468 --> 01:22:59,840
I promise I won't.

1079
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:04,629
I try not to be a burden.
I'm not just talking financial.

1080
01:23:04,933 --> 01:23:07,554
How could you be a burden to anyone?

1081
01:23:09,187 --> 01:23:11,642
If William, or Bill,
as I like to call him...

1082
01:23:11,898 --> 01:23:14,815
He likes Bill.
I call him Bill too.

1083
01:23:15,067 --> 01:23:16,810
If Bill said he was going home...

1084
01:23:17,027 --> 01:23:20,063
...could he have meant
where his wife and child live?

1085
01:23:20,322 --> 01:23:22,812
Ex-wife.
We shouldn't be in here.

1086
01:23:24,617 --> 01:23:28,449
Ex-wife, right. Elizabeth.
What's her maiden name?

1087
01:23:28,662 --> 01:23:31,616
Trevino. She was part Italian.
You know how they are.

1088
01:23:31,874 --> 01:23:34,364
- Where's Elizabeth now?
- I wouldn't know.

1089
01:23:35,919 --> 01:23:38,160
You don't know where
your grandchild lives?

1090
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:44,043
He doesn't want me to know.
He blames me for what happened.

1091
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:47,800
What's the word?

1092
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:52,677
- He was fired over a month ago.
- What?

1093
01:24:00,565 --> 01:24:03,234
Where has he been going every day?

1094
01:24:03,818 --> 01:24:06,143
Where has he been eating his lunch?

1095
01:24:19,582 --> 01:24:22,155
Why are you putting
barbed wire on that fence?

1096
01:24:22,376 --> 01:24:23,407
Is it a joke?

1097
01:24:23,669 --> 01:24:27,251
Is this how rich people have fun?
You put barbed wire on the fence...

1098
01:24:27,506 --> 01:24:30,542
...so innocent people like me
can cut our hands?

1099
01:24:32,302 --> 01:24:34,709
No, please. I'm the caretaker.

1100
01:24:34,971 --> 01:24:36,513
It's just a barbecue.

1101
01:24:37,431 --> 01:24:40,135
Dr. Ashcroft has let us do this before.

1102
01:24:41,893 --> 01:24:43,471
You don't live here?

1103
01:24:43,895 --> 01:24:45,934
Is it really necessary to tell them?

1104
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:48,513
Tell who?

1105
01:24:49,733 --> 01:24:50,729
Altmore Security.

1106
01:24:52,111 --> 01:24:54,103
Aren't you with them?

1107
01:25:03,329 --> 01:25:05,155
No, please!

1108
01:25:06,373 --> 01:25:08,449
It's okay, honey.
It's okay, baby.

1109
01:25:21,928 --> 01:25:23,837
What kind of doctor lives here?

1110
01:25:25,265 --> 01:25:26,759
Plastic surgeon.

1111
01:25:30,853 --> 01:25:32,810
Plastic surgery bought all this?

1112
01:25:34,856 --> 01:25:37,062
Guess I'm in the wrong racket.

1113
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,480
Are there correspondence courses
in plastic surgery?

1114
01:25:47,367 --> 01:25:49,360
I lost my job.

1115
01:25:49,578 --> 01:25:52,863
Actually, I didn't lose it.
It lost me.

1116
01:25:53,623 --> 01:25:57,406
I'm overeducated, underskilled...

1117
01:25:59,962 --> 01:26:02,417
Maybe it's the other way around.
I forget.

1118
01:26:02,714 --> 01:26:04,588
And I'm obsolete.

1119
01:26:06,509 --> 01:26:09,794
I'm not economically viable.

1120
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:16,471
I can't even support my own kid.

1121
01:26:19,479 --> 01:26:21,352
Are you hurt? I'm sorry.

1122
01:26:21,606 --> 01:26:23,812
I didn't hurt you, honey.
I'm sorry.

1123
01:26:24,275 --> 01:26:25,188
It's all right.

1124
01:26:26,151 --> 01:26:27,266
It's your hand.

1125
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,443
You cut your hand.

1126
01:26:33,658 --> 01:26:35,449
It's my hand.

1127
01:26:40,539 --> 01:26:42,531
Please take me with you.

1128
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:46,745
They won't do anything
if I'm with you.

1129
01:26:47,962 --> 01:26:49,836
Just please let them go.

1130
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:57,210
What do you think?
You think I want to hurt your family?

1131
01:27:00,974 --> 01:27:03,180
I have a family of my own.

1132
01:27:05,311 --> 01:27:06,141
You don't believe me?

1133
01:27:07,563 --> 01:27:09,021
We believe you.

1134
01:27:13,026 --> 01:27:16,525
That's where I'm going.
I'm going home to see my family.

1135
01:27:20,324 --> 01:27:22,779
It's my little girl's birthday today.

1136
01:27:24,661 --> 01:27:28,610
We were gonna have a barbecue,
like you guys...

1137
01:27:30,041 --> 01:27:32,578
...and she was gonna play outside...

1138
01:27:33,669 --> 01:27:36,539
...and my wife would hold my hand...

1139
01:27:37,881 --> 01:27:40,502
...and talk about grownup things.

1140
01:27:44,553 --> 01:27:46,760
And then when it got dark...

1141
01:27:48,015 --> 01:27:50,506
...we'd all go to sleep together.

1142
01:27:53,186 --> 01:27:55,724
We'd all sleep together in the dark.

1143
01:27:58,524 --> 01:28:00,315
And everything...

1144
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:03,855
...would be just like it was before.

1145
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:16,869
You can't leave. Believe me,
something's happened to him.

1146
01:28:17,082 --> 01:28:20,166
It doesn't take all day
to drive from Pasadena to Venice.

1147
01:28:20,376 --> 01:28:23,543
That doesn't constitute
a threatening phone call.

1148
01:28:23,754 --> 01:28:26,210
The guy was talking about
Star Trek or something.

1149
01:28:26,465 --> 01:28:29,964
- He's getting a kick out of scaring you.
- Please don't leave.

1150
01:28:30,218 --> 01:28:33,883
There's only one thing you can do
to really feel safer.

1151
01:28:34,097 --> 01:28:36,054
Next time there's a proposition...

1152
01:28:36,265 --> 01:28:40,642
...to cut the number of patrol cars
on the street, vote no, okay?

1153
01:28:40,853 --> 01:28:43,141
Have a nice day.

1154
01:29:00,203 --> 01:29:01,827
What have you found so far?

1155
01:29:02,038 --> 01:29:03,532
No luck on Foster-Trevino.

1156
01:29:03,790 --> 01:29:06,197
Go straight to the maiden name.

1157
01:29:06,709 --> 01:29:09,413
I've got something
on an Army-Navy store.

1158
01:29:09,711 --> 01:29:12,249
- Where?
- Here.

1159
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:16,169
Jesus, Prendergast, I was there!

1160
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:17,926
That guy was a prick.

1161
01:29:18,177 --> 01:29:19,802
You know what else he was?

1162
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:23,885
Murdered. They found him stuffed
in his own display case.

1163
01:29:24,182 --> 01:29:25,641
Oh, my God!

1164
01:29:25,892 --> 01:29:28,300
Here, I'll help you change the...

1165
01:29:36,110 --> 01:29:37,687
You know what they did?

1166
01:29:37,945 --> 01:29:42,772
They turned our ice-cream parlor into
a Southwest American, New Age thing.

1167
01:29:43,032 --> 01:29:44,906
I went to buy a rocking horse.

1168
01:29:45,159 --> 01:29:48,777
All I could find was a unicorn
with an Indian on top of it.

1169
01:29:48,996 --> 01:29:52,032
Can you believe that, Elizabeth?
Can you believe it?

1170
01:29:55,043 --> 01:29:56,157
Come on!

1171
01:29:57,128 --> 01:29:59,286
Where are we going?
When's my birthday?

1172
01:30:44,378 --> 01:30:47,627
Some G.I. Joe gave a geezer
a heart attack at the golf course...

1173
01:30:47,839 --> 01:30:50,544
...and accosted a family
right next door.

1174
01:30:50,758 --> 01:30:51,707
A G.I. Joe?

1175
01:30:51,926 --> 01:30:56,303
He's wearing the kind of jacket
you find in an Army-Navy store.

1176
01:30:57,431 --> 01:30:59,969
I found her!
Trevino, Elizabeth.

1177
01:31:00,183 --> 01:31:01,013
Don't tell me.

1178
01:31:01,893 --> 01:31:02,842
Venice.

1179
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:05,516
How'd you know?

1180
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:08,137
Where else would an Italian move to?

1181
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:11,316
Look what I got.

1182
01:31:12,694 --> 01:31:17,819
We got a puppy.
We got a puppy.

1183
01:31:19,742 --> 01:31:22,992
Happy birthday to you

1184
01:31:23,912 --> 01:31:27,246
Happy birthday to you

1185
01:31:42,887 --> 01:31:43,753
Hi, puppy!

1186
01:31:56,441 --> 01:31:58,433
No answer at the ex-wife.

1187
01:31:58,693 --> 01:32:01,563
- You send the cavalry?
- No, Pacific Division are pricks.

1188
01:32:01,779 --> 01:32:05,527
They can't send units to the same
address three times in a day...

1189
01:32:05,741 --> 01:32:07,484
...to comfort some hysterical woman.

1190
01:32:07,701 --> 01:32:10,108
- What do you want to do?
- Go to Venice.

1191
01:32:10,495 --> 01:32:12,618
Get that, would you?

1192
01:32:12,830 --> 01:32:13,660
Prendergast here.

1193
01:32:13,915 --> 01:32:14,994
Who the fuck is this?

1194
01:32:15,624 --> 01:32:17,498
Shit. It's your wife.

1195
01:32:17,751 --> 01:32:19,126
Oh, boy. Hon?

1196
01:32:19,378 --> 01:32:22,082
Yeah, "hon." I know who that was!

1197
01:32:22,297 --> 01:32:24,752
Mr. Peepers just scratched
the shit out of me...

1198
01:32:25,008 --> 01:32:27,083
...and I'm bleeding like a stuck pig.

1199
01:32:27,718 --> 01:32:29,510
Something important's come up.

1200
01:32:30,012 --> 01:32:31,886
What am I? Dog vomit?

1201
01:32:32,097 --> 01:32:34,136
Your wife says
she's bleeding to death...

1202
01:32:34,349 --> 01:32:36,674
...and you say something
important has come up?

1203
01:32:37,811 --> 01:32:40,218
- When are you coming home?
- I don't know.

1204
01:32:41,272 --> 01:32:43,941
Don't tell me you don't know.

1205
01:32:44,149 --> 01:32:47,518
I want to know when the hell
you're coming home, now!

1206
01:32:47,778 --> 01:32:50,066
Amanda, shut up!

1207
01:32:50,447 --> 01:32:52,071
Did you hear me?
Shut up!

1208
01:32:53,783 --> 01:32:57,401
I'll get home when I'm finished,
not a second before. Is that clear?

1209
01:32:57,953 --> 01:32:59,613
Is that clear?

1210
01:33:01,873 --> 01:33:04,542
You don't have to bite my head off.

1211
01:33:05,668 --> 01:33:09,962
And you have dinner ready
and waiting for me, okay?

1212
01:33:10,881 --> 01:33:14,629
And leave the skin on the chicken.
All right?

1213
01:33:17,846 --> 01:33:18,877
Goodbye.

1214
01:33:23,934 --> 01:33:25,179
Shit!

1215
01:33:25,936 --> 01:33:26,967
Let's go!

1216
01:33:27,437 --> 01:33:29,513
Surprise!

1217
01:33:32,567 --> 01:33:34,559
I'm sorry, Prendergast!

1218
01:33:34,819 --> 01:33:39,943
We tried and tried, but could not
fit your fucking name on the cake!

1219
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:44,610
Congratulations.
You made it out alive!

1220
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:45,824
Listen, listen.

1221
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:48,658
All right, hold it, hold it.

1222
01:33:48,998 --> 01:33:52,283
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've been waiting for.

1223
01:33:52,543 --> 01:33:56,872
This afternoon's entertainment,
Miss Suzie!

1224
01:34:04,678 --> 01:34:05,793
Suzie Q!

1225
01:34:06,055 --> 01:34:08,343
Do your thing!

1226
01:34:08,974 --> 01:34:11,511
Is this the retiring boy?

1227
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:13,767
Wait, wait!
This is great, guys.

1228
01:34:13,978 --> 01:34:18,770
This is great.
I appreciate it, but I can't stay.

1229
01:34:19,275 --> 01:34:22,608
Jesus! What's your problem?
You afraid of women too?

1230
01:34:22,819 --> 01:34:25,440
I don't blame him.
You ever met his wife?

1231
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:27,819
What did you say?

1232
01:34:28,157 --> 01:34:29,616
- What?
- What did you say?

1233
01:34:29,825 --> 01:34:30,655
Nothing.

1234
01:34:30,910 --> 01:34:33,365
We don't have time for this.

1235
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,491
You're right.

1236
01:34:42,211 --> 01:34:43,492
Ready, honey?

1237
01:34:48,258 --> 01:34:52,172
Happy birthday to you

1238
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:54,845
Happy birthday...

1239
01:34:55,139 --> 01:34:57,132
...to you

1240
01:34:58,517 --> 01:34:59,596
No cake for you?

1241
01:34:59,852 --> 01:35:02,140
If she doesn't want it,
don't force her.

1242
01:35:02,396 --> 01:35:04,222
Okay, you can have the teddy.

1243
01:35:04,481 --> 01:35:06,224
Time to go horsy!

1244
01:35:07,525 --> 01:35:10,063
It's okay. Horsy!
It's okay.

1245
01:35:10,778 --> 01:35:13,399
Giddyap, giddyap.

1246
01:35:18,368 --> 01:35:21,737
- She doesn't want to.
- Just put her on the horse!

1247
01:35:22,371 --> 01:35:24,743
There we go! Horsy ride.

1248
01:35:26,041 --> 01:35:27,120
She doesn't want to.

1249
01:35:27,376 --> 01:35:30,875
- Put her on the horse!
- You can't force her like that.

1250
01:35:31,129 --> 01:35:33,454
I bought her the goddamn horse.

1251
01:35:33,715 --> 01:35:35,921
Here we go! Horsy ride.

1252
01:35:36,175 --> 01:35:39,259
You're scaring her.
I want you to stop this.

1253
01:35:43,473 --> 01:35:46,260
Come on, honey.
It's your birthday. It's the pier.

1254
01:35:46,518 --> 01:35:49,886
It's your favorite place.
You love the pier.

1255
01:35:53,065 --> 01:35:54,476
Why do you do this?

1256
01:36:21,715 --> 01:36:23,174
Take the back.

1257
01:36:27,512 --> 01:36:28,792
Freeze!

1258
01:36:56,371 --> 01:36:57,200
You okay?

1259
01:36:57,455 --> 01:36:59,946
- I'm all right.
- Somebody get an ambulance.

1260
01:37:00,374 --> 01:37:03,825
Get an ambulance! Call 911!
Get an ambulance!

1261
01:37:04,127 --> 01:37:08,623
Tell them an officer's been shot!
Go, go, go! Get an ambulance!

1262
01:37:11,217 --> 01:37:12,047
Be careful!

1263
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:15,678
Go get the bastard!

1264
01:37:16,013 --> 01:37:17,804
He's still dressed like G.I. Joe!

1265
01:38:12,229 --> 01:38:14,470
Daddy! Mommy, look.
Daddy!

1266
01:38:32,497 --> 01:38:33,326
Hi, honey.

1267
01:38:33,831 --> 01:38:35,989
I thought I'd find you here.

1268
01:38:38,543 --> 01:38:39,741
Leave us alone!

1269
01:38:41,254 --> 01:38:43,377
What? I can't talk to my wife?

1270
01:38:44,132 --> 01:38:45,507
I'm not your wife anymore.

1271
01:38:45,842 --> 01:38:49,969
No? Sugar, does this ring a bell?
"Till death do us part"?

1272
01:38:50,471 --> 01:38:52,214
Do you remember that?

1273
01:38:59,187 --> 01:39:00,016
I'm sorry.

1274
01:39:00,438 --> 01:39:01,932
Sorry, sorry.

1275
01:39:02,189 --> 01:39:03,138
What are you doing?

1276
01:39:03,399 --> 01:39:06,068
I'm coming home from
a hard day at the office.

1277
01:39:06,318 --> 01:39:08,725
God bless the working stiffs!

1278
01:39:15,826 --> 01:39:18,068
Please leave her alone!

1279
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:30,629
You're so big!

1280
01:39:32,466 --> 01:39:33,924
How'd you get so big?

1281
01:39:37,178 --> 01:39:38,589
I missed it.

1282
01:39:39,597 --> 01:39:41,673
They stole it from me, honey.

1283
01:39:42,683 --> 01:39:45,434
Don't you worry. They're not
gonna take it anymore.

1284
01:39:50,732 --> 01:39:52,558
Bill, listen, please.

1285
01:39:54,986 --> 01:39:57,310
You've got to stop this.

1286
01:40:01,158 --> 01:40:02,735
You need help.

1287
01:40:04,369 --> 01:40:05,483
You're sick.

1288
01:40:06,329 --> 01:40:07,360
Sick?

1289
01:40:08,456 --> 01:40:10,115
You wanna see sick?

1290
01:40:10,332 --> 01:40:12,621
Take a walk around this town.
That's sick.

1291
01:40:12,834 --> 01:40:14,032
You ain't kidding.

1292
01:40:17,964 --> 01:40:20,881
Would you believe it
that I used to fish right here?

1293
01:40:23,552 --> 01:40:25,461
This very spot?

1294
01:40:25,971 --> 01:40:28,806
Now they tell you,
"Don't eat the fish. It's poisonous."

1295
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:32,638
You can't even swim in the water.

1296
01:40:32,977 --> 01:40:35,894
It'll give you some kind of
bacterial infection.

1297
01:40:37,439 --> 01:40:39,231
How's that for sick?

1298
01:40:39,816 --> 01:40:42,734
I'm having a private moment
with my family. Leave us alone.

1299
01:40:43,194 --> 01:40:45,068
I'm leaving soon.

1300
01:40:46,197 --> 01:40:48,902
I'm retiring to Arizona.
Lake Havasu City.

1301
01:40:49,617 --> 01:40:50,648
You been there?

1302
01:40:50,910 --> 01:40:52,569
That's not what I mean!

1303
01:40:54,538 --> 01:40:58,582
They call it a lake, but it's really
just a big bowl of muddy water.

1304
01:40:58,791 --> 01:41:01,329
But the wife thinks it's paradise.

1305
01:41:02,128 --> 01:41:05,081
Everybody has their own idea
of what paradise is.

1306
01:41:08,508 --> 01:41:09,623
Take me, for instance.

1307
01:41:12,345 --> 01:41:14,468
You know what I thought paradise was?

1308
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:17,171
- What?
- Lf you'll excuse me.

1309
01:41:18,726 --> 01:41:19,924
Making babies.

1310
01:41:20,978 --> 01:41:24,062
Ain't that a kick?
Making babies.

1311
01:41:25,482 --> 01:41:27,189
This your little girl?

1312
01:41:28,025 --> 01:41:29,484
Beautiful.

1313
01:41:31,445 --> 01:41:32,643
She's special.

1314
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:40,534
You know, my wife never was
cut out for motherhood.

1315
01:41:41,204 --> 01:41:42,283
She did it all for me.

1316
01:41:42,538 --> 01:41:45,325
Went through all that pain,
lost her figure, for me.

1317
01:41:46,417 --> 01:41:49,287
Then the kid went to sleep
one night, never woke up.

1318
01:41:50,503 --> 01:41:52,828
They called it " Infant Death...

1319
01:41:54,173 --> 01:41:55,751
...Syndrome."

1320
01:41:56,884 --> 01:41:59,553
But she wasn't an infant.
She was 2 years old.

1321
01:41:59,762 --> 01:42:01,553
She was a big girl.

1322
01:42:03,265 --> 01:42:04,924
She was our baby.

1323
01:42:08,019 --> 01:42:10,889
Here, darling, this is for you.
Here you go.

1324
01:42:17,485 --> 01:42:19,312
What can you do?

1325
01:42:20,613 --> 01:42:23,483
If she'd been hit by a drunk driver...

1326
01:42:23,783 --> 01:42:26,404
But who do you blame
when they just don't wake up?

1327
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:28,068
Thank you, sweetheart.

1328
01:42:32,540 --> 01:42:33,785
There's a guy with a gun!

1329
01:42:38,003 --> 01:42:39,747
No! Don't!

1330
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:42,621
Elizabeth, no!

1331
01:42:43,383 --> 01:42:46,004
Freeze!
You're under arrest.

1332
01:42:46,219 --> 01:42:47,250
Get out of here!

1333
01:42:48,262 --> 01:42:49,756
Freeze!

1334
01:42:53,058 --> 01:42:55,430
- What were you gonna do?
- I don't know!

1335
01:42:55,644 --> 01:42:57,802
Guys like you always say that!

1336
01:42:58,063 --> 01:43:02,439
You know exactly what you were
gonna do. Kill your wife and child!

1337
01:43:03,901 --> 01:43:08,444
Then it'd be too late to turn back.
It'd be easy to kill yourself.

1338
01:43:08,947 --> 01:43:12,530
Let's go meet some nice policemen.
They're good guys. Let's go.

1339
01:43:13,952 --> 01:43:14,983
I'm the bad guy?

1340
01:43:21,291 --> 01:43:23,331
How did that happen?

1341
01:43:24,753 --> 01:43:27,290
I did everything they told me to.

1342
01:43:30,508 --> 01:43:32,002
Did you know I build missiles?

1343
01:43:32,927 --> 01:43:34,800
I help to protect America.

1344
01:43:38,306 --> 01:43:40,180
You should be rewarded for that.

1345
01:43:40,391 --> 01:43:44,009
Instead, they give it to
the plastic surgeon. They lied to me.

1346
01:43:46,355 --> 01:43:50,222
Is that what this is about?
You're angry because you got lied to?

1347
01:43:50,734 --> 01:43:53,022
Is that why my dinner's
drying out in the oven?

1348
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:56,939
They lie to everybody.
They lie to the fish!

1349
01:43:58,407 --> 01:44:01,324
That doesn't give you any right
to do what you did today.

1350
01:44:01,994 --> 01:44:06,869
The only thing that makes you special
is that little girl. Now, let's go.

1351
01:44:07,999 --> 01:44:09,410
Let's go!

1352
01:44:16,757 --> 01:44:18,381
Sure was hot today, wasn't it?

1353
01:44:21,344 --> 01:44:23,171
He has a gun!
The end of the pier!

1354
01:44:23,388 --> 01:44:26,341
Keep this crowd back!
Let's get some backup!

1355
01:44:31,186 --> 01:44:32,597
You know, I got a gun.

1356
01:44:38,985 --> 01:44:40,229
In my pocket.

1357
01:44:44,906 --> 01:44:46,021
I got lots of guns.

1358
01:44:46,283 --> 01:44:48,608
Stay there. Don't move.

1359
01:44:49,285 --> 01:44:50,115
You wanna draw?

1360
01:44:50,787 --> 01:44:53,491
Let's not.
Let's call it a day.

1361
01:44:53,747 --> 01:44:55,491
Now come on.

1362
01:44:55,708 --> 01:44:57,581
It's perfect.

1363
01:44:58,126 --> 01:45:01,625
Showdown between the sheriff
and the bad guy?

1364
01:45:03,715 --> 01:45:04,912
It's beautiful.

1365
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:11,085
On three.

1366
01:45:11,346 --> 01:45:14,762
This doesn't have to be the end.
You have a choice.

1367
01:45:14,974 --> 01:45:18,308
My little girl is dead.
I don't have a choice. You do!

1368
01:45:18,936 --> 01:45:21,178
No, you have two choices:

1369
01:45:21,647 --> 01:45:22,809
I can kill you.

1370
01:45:23,941 --> 01:45:25,933
Or you can kill me...

1371
01:45:26,359 --> 01:45:29,064
...and my little girl
can get the insurance.

1372
01:45:31,781 --> 01:45:32,611
One...

1373
01:45:32,865 --> 01:45:34,904
Don't you wanna see her grow up?

1374
01:45:35,534 --> 01:45:37,408
Behind bars?

1375
01:45:41,748 --> 01:45:43,290
Don't do this.
Please.

1376
01:45:45,001 --> 01:45:46,281
- Let's go!
- Three.

1377
01:45:55,427 --> 01:45:57,633
I would have got you.

1378
01:46:37,046 --> 01:46:41,209
What cooperation was there between
Pacific Division and Downtown?

1379
01:46:41,425 --> 01:46:43,548
Not to denigrate the Venice Police...

1380
01:46:43,802 --> 01:46:47,337
...but it was one of our fellows
that put this together.

1381
01:46:47,556 --> 01:46:48,966
Prendergast!

1382
01:46:49,641 --> 01:46:53,305
This is Sergeant Prendergast.
Damn fine work, Prendergast.

1383
01:46:53,603 --> 01:46:56,473
Fuck you, Captain Yardley.
Fuck you very much!

1384
01:46:56,689 --> 01:46:58,811
I can't believe...
Did he just say that?

1385
01:46:59,024 --> 01:47:00,435
You're welcome.

1386
01:47:04,654 --> 01:47:06,730
- You still here?
- Afraid so.

1387
01:47:06,948 --> 01:47:10,150
We've stabilized her.
She'll be all right.

1388
01:47:10,367 --> 01:47:12,490
I'll see you at the hospital.

1389
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:17,490
How are you doing?

1390
01:47:20,918 --> 01:47:22,163
I haven't told her yet.

1391
01:47:23,754 --> 01:47:25,414
Oh, shit!

1392
01:47:26,632 --> 01:47:29,301
It's her birthday.
What should I do?

1393
01:47:30,510 --> 01:47:32,301
Tell her tomorrow.

1394
01:47:32,804 --> 01:47:34,428
Let her have her little party.

1395
01:47:42,103 --> 01:47:44,594
- What's your name, darling?
- Adele.

1396
01:47:44,814 --> 01:47:47,519
Adele?
That's a nice name.

1397
01:47:48,150 --> 01:47:51,234
If I had a little girl,
I'd want her to be named Adele.

1398
01:47:51,445 --> 01:47:54,196
- What's yours?
- Mine?

1399
01:47:56,074 --> 01:47:57,948
My name is mud.

1400
01:48:00,244 --> 01:48:01,869
Your name is not mud.

1401
01:48:02,079 --> 01:48:05,033
It will be when my wife
finds out that...

1402
01:48:05,249 --> 01:48:07,122
...I'm still a cop.

1403
01:48:12,338 --> 01:48:13,583
Excuse me.

1404
01:48:17,718 --> 01:48:19,627
Sergeant just signed us out.

1405
01:48:19,845 --> 01:48:22,514
- All right, let's eat.
- Where you wanna go?

1406
01:48:23,264 --> 01:48:26,135
Let's go around the corner
and get one of those...

1407
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:34,397
Look what I got!

1408
01:48:37,902 --> 01:48:40,227
Just call him, "Hi, Puppy."

1409
01:48:40,738 --> 01:48:42,232
Hi, Puppy.

1410
01:48:43,574 --> 01:48:45,116
Hi, Puppy.

1411
01:48:50,288 --> 01:48:53,408
There we are!
We got everybody there.

1412
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:56,124
We got everybody...
