  We about to die !

629
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,660
 Okay, get on your feet.

630
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,350
  - Enough, all right ? - Put that down !

631
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,630
  It's a bomb ! Hey ! Put that down !

632
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,630
 Guys, no bomb. Nothing.

633
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,660
 Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.

634
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,800
  Throw us in jail ?

635
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,560
  Lady, you must be outta your mind.   I'm about to bust you right now.

636
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,400
 I'm an undercover agent for the United States secret service.

637
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,510
  - How do we know that ?   Show me a badge right now.  - Here you go.

638
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,770
  Let me see that again. I- I didn't get a good look at that.

639
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,100
  We can help you. I'm a detective from Hong Kong.

640
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,970
 I know who you are, Inspector Lee.  I know.

641
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,640
 We need to go out of sight, so come down to my suite.

642
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,920
 Now why did you say it was a bomb ? - No, you said that.

643
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,580
 No, you said it. -You said that in the hotel room.

644
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,920
 I said she was the bomb.

645
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,150
  She was the bomb ?

646
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,460
  Look, I've been working this case for months now,

647
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,690
  So if I seem a little aggravated, I apologize.

648
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,290
 You need to tell us what's goin' on.

649
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,850
 The triads and Reign, they think I'm a crooked customs agent.

650
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,360
  - Is that a payoff ? - No.  That's a sample.

651
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:31,360
  You guys ever heard of the superbill ?

652
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,830
 I heard of it.  It's a myth. Some kind of counterfeit.

653
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:36,340
  Honey, it's much more than a counterfeit.

654
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,890
  Fourteen out of fifteen world banks  can't even tell the difference.

655
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,200
 The paper is crane linen blend, and the bills are printed on U.S. intaglio presses.

656
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,900
 You wanna tell us how in the world  they get into the U.S. mint to use the presses ?

657
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,900
  In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the shah of Iran.

658
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,570
  Why ?  Because we wanted his oil.

659
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:56,830
  Our government gave him a gift--

660
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,780
  A U.S. treasury intaglio printing press.

661
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,780
  Now, it's the only one to ever leave the country.

662
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,450
  Five years ago, Ricky Tan bought  the press on the black market.

663
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:05,980
  Five years ago ? Mm-hmm.

664
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,610
  That's right before he left the force.

665
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:11,610
 Earlier this year, Ricky Tan got a hold of one-of-a-kind swiss-made hundred-dollar plates,

666
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,410
  and he started printing superbills.

667
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,780
  that's why Hu Li killed him-- for the plates.

668
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,590
 and they've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars.

669
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,420
 There's only one way to spot a fake.

670
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,560
 They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red.

671
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,620
  You see ? Now, the real ink, it burns black.

672
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:35,530
 So what in the hell they gonna do  with $100 million of phony money ?

673
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:39,560
  You know, Carter, I believe you're asking the wrong question.

674
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,800
  The real question is, where are the plates ?

675
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,570
  Because if we can find the plates,  we can stop the whole operation.

676
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,040
  - Right ? - Yeah, you're right.

677
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:52,930
  Maybe this is where you can help us, guys.

678
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,870
  Yeah.  I mean, Carter, This is your city, right ?

679
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:59,270
 Yeah, this is my titty. I mean, this is my city.

680
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:02,170
  Great.  And Lee, you know Hu Li and the triads, correct ?

681
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:05,540
  -Yes.  -Great.

682
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:09,440
  So can you do me a favor ? Can you find out where Hu Li's keeping the plates ?

683
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,540
  -That ain't no problem.  -Thank you.

684
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:13,880
  So welcome aboard, gentlemen.

685
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,920
 From this moment on, you're officially working  for the United States secret service.

686
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:23,280
  Secret service agent James Carter.

687
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:26,420
  Oh, that sounds good. It's got a nice ring to it, don't it ?

688
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,930
  I'm tellin' you, Lee, give me six months.

689
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:31,790
  Six months and I'm gonna be in Washington, D.C., protectin' the president.

690
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,420
 We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.

691
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:37,490
  Yeah, but they don't know that.

692
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,990
  I'm gonna talk to Isabella, see if she can hook somethin' up.

00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,830
  seein' the way she was starin' at a brother. - She never even look at you.

694
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,810
  Just jealous, Lee, 'cause the girl chose me,

695
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:49,430
  'cause I'm tall, dark and handsome,  and you third-world ugly.

696
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,930
 I'm not third-world ugly. Women like me.

697
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,270
 They think I'm cute, like snoopy.

698
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,510
  Lee, snoopy is six inches taller than you.

  A thousand years ago, a small, wealthy village in China...

01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,680
  hired a young dragon to guard their treasures in a cave.

  the people of the village started sneaking him extra food,

  hoping to make him stronger.

900
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,290
  the dragon grew so big he got stuck,

901
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,800
  and the treasure was trapped behind him...

902

 Put your arms around me.  What ?

  Last time you needed my help, I woke up in a truck.

  Why don't you go get them ?  -Because if I'm wrong,

  How do I know I can trust you ?

  [ shouting ]

1085
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:22,770
  yaah !

1086
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:38,980
  aah !

01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,450
  [ gasping ]

01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:01,720
  [ gasping ]

1090
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,070
  Thank you, Benjamin.  Thank you.

1091
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,400
  We could have been a good couple.

1092
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:21,660
  We could have had somethin' special.

1093
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:23,740
  But you one crazy-ass bitch !

1094
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:37,240
 American's love to gamble, don't they, Mr. Reign ?

1095
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:40,890
  I never gamble.

1096
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:43,120
  Oh, I'm, uh, cutting our deal short.

1097
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:45,240
  Oh.

1098
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:48,350
  And my plates ?

1099
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:51,120
  The plates stay with me. I'm sure you won't have a problem with that.

1100
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:56,520
 I enjoyed that little story you told...

1101
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:58,760
 about the dragon and the treasure.

1102
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:01,320
 My mother used to tell it to me all the time.

1103
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:05,660
 Do you know the moral of that story ?

1104
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:08,230
  Greed will imprison us all.

1105
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,440
  [ choking ] I hate that fortune-cookie shit.

1106
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,410
  Just like your father.

1107
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,540
  I really did try to help him, you know.

1108
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:37,510
  To share with him.

1109
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:39,950
  To make your life better.

1110
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:42,080
  But he was too weak.

1111
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,840
  Too afraid of change.  -Give me the plates.

1112
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:48,780
  -It's over.  -I don't think it's over.

1113
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:52,420
  There are casinos all over this country.

1114
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:55,960
  I can make you a very rich man, Lee.

1115
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,150
  Don't make the same mistake your father did.

1116
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:01,880
  If you reach for that gun, I'll kill you.

1117
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,430
 Don't you remember ? I'm already dead.

1118
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:14,830
  Hey, Ricky. How you doin' ?

1119
01:19:14,830 --> 01:19:17,130
  Lee, I see you got everything under control.

1120
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:19,500
  I'm gonna go downstairs and--  goddamn !

1121
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:22,640
 - What happened to Reign ? - Would you like me to tell you how your father died ?

1122
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:26,360
 Hey, hey.  Wait one second, Lee.

1123
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,440
  It ain't worth it, man. He tryin' to trick you.

1124
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:31,300
  Don't go too far, now.  -He never begged for his life or tried to make a deal.

1125
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:35,070
  Put the gun down. -All he asked me,

1126
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:37,980
  just seconds before I pulled the trigger,

1127
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:40,110
  was that I promise not to kill you.

1128
01:19:41,070 --> 01:19:42,970
 Oh, it was so pathetic.

1129
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:46,310
 Oh, hell, no.  He went too far. Shoot his ass right now, Lee. Shoot his ass !

1130
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:50,040
 - What are you gonna do, Lee ? - All you got to do is pull that trigger back and bam !

1131
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:54,120
 Are you going to spend  the rest of your life hiding like your father ?

1132
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:57,210
  Man, don't let him talk about your daddy like that.  Shoot him, Lee.

1133
01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:59,910
 - You can't do it, can you ? - Yes, hell, you can, Lee.

1134
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:02,390
  - Ain't nobody up here but us. - Just as I thought.

1135
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:04,320
  He tryin' to punk you. Shoot him !

1136
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,890
  If you ain't gonna shoot him, kung fu his ass or somethin'.

1137

  - Carter ! - [ screams ]

  Damn ! Good kick, Lee.

1142
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,010
  It was an accident.

1143
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:36,980
 - That's okay.  We'll just say he tried to catch a cab.   [ door opens ]

  What's that in your-- oh, hell, no.

  - [ Cantonese ] - Lady, you listen to me right now.

 You put that bomb down and turn it off !  Carter, we have to jump !

1147
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,750
 - You crazy.  I ain't jumpin'. - [ Cantonese ] - [ beeping ]

1148
01:20:52,190 --> 01:20:54,540
  Use your jacket ! Hey, turn that bomb off !

 I cannot believe I flew 10,000 miles for this shit.

1157
01:22:04,930 --> 01:22:07,250
 Detective Lee, I hate to admit it,

1158
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:10,320
  but the United States secret service is indebted to you.

1159

  -Thank you.  -Thank you.

 You sly devil, you. She kissed you, didn't she ?

1165
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:50,430
 Ah, you played it cool, too, walkin' away and not lookin' back.  I like that.

  Mmm.

1169

 Is that your gate down there ? - Yep.

 Well, I'm this way.

 Take good care of yourself, Lee.

 What's up ?

1176

  There is something I want you to have.

 Oh, no, man. This is your daddy's badge.  I can't take that, man.  No way.

1178
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:35,370
  It's okay. No. Finally, I can let it go.

  I got it at the tables this mornin' at Caesar's.  I'm still hot.

  Go ahead.  Enjoy yourself. -No, Carter. I can't have this.

1185
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:58,380
 Would you stop actin' like a cop for one second, man, and live it up ?

  There gotta be something you want.  Come on.

  - Amen to that, brother.   -So, what do you say ?
