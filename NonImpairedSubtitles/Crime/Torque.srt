1
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,131
Fast bike, huh?

2
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:07,499
Yeah, sometimes.

3
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:09,745
Want me to fill it up?

4
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:12,541
I'm not here for the gas.

5
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:15,314
You can keep an eye on it for me.

6
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:48,981
Leave it on the road, guys.

7
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:52,513
That stunt almost cost me my ride, boy.

8
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:57,018
- You were in my way. I was in a hurry.
- Well, now you'll be late.

9
00:02:57,527 --> 00:03:01,019
Hey! Get your dirty little punk ass
off my car.

10
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:07,666
What is it about driving cars
that makes you all such assholes?

11
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,533
Can you do something
about these dirty windows?

12
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:41,033
Five bucks.

13
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:42,865
Make it 10.

14
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:48,904
Thanks.

15
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:52,038
Buckle up.

16
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,192
Well. It didn't take long
for you to find trouble.

17
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:07,961
Step up. I'm running
a two-for-one special today.

18
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,093
Special, huh?

19
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:16,230
Can I get fries with that?
Because I'm hungry as hell.

20
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,271
- What's up, Ford? How you doing, boy?
- Good to see you, man.

21
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:23,037
- Wish I could say the same for you.
- Welcome home.

22
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:27,080
Thanks, man.
Val, Dalton. Late as usual.

23
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:33,245
Dude's gone six months in Thailand without
a word and now he's busting our chops.

24
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:35,823
Since when did you get so sensitive?

25
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:37,584
I got a rally to get to.

26
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,625
You must be in a hurry to die.

27
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:43,596
Henry James and his boys aren't gonna be
as happy to see you as we are.

28
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:47,463
- You were on the run. Why you back now?
- I gotta make things right.

29
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:52,104
I couldn't stop thinking about her.

30
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:56,473
- And here I thought it was all about us.
- Look...

31
00:04:56,646 --> 00:05:00,673
...this is my mess, not yours.
You don't have to make this run.

32
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:04,310
- We can't let you have all the fun.
- You're gonna need us.

33
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,187
Yes, I am.

34
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,156
Still know how to ride that thing?

35
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:13,795
We'll have to race
the twisties to find out.

36
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:18,725
Ford, what the hell are you doing?

37
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:22,735
I don't want to miss that look
on your face when I blow past you.

38
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,901
What the...?

39
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:48,508
- We got company.
- Out of my way, punk!

40
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:55,284
What's his problem?

41
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,193
I got him!

42
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,365
- Your ass is mine.
- Let's go, punk.

43
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:08,970
Come on, what you got?

44
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:11,936
- You like that?
- Bring that piece of shit on.

45
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,326
I'm burning, I'm burning.

46
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:43,569
- Relax!
- You should've let him burn!

47
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:45,104
He could've killed us!

48
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:49,574
Hey, punk, we ain't done yet.
Move out of the way.

49
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:52,578
Let's see if this guy fights
as bad as he rides.

50
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:55,412
- Walk away.
- You got loud pipes...

51
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:57,644
...but you ain't saying nothing!

52
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,685
You ain't gonna like how this ends.

53
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:22,003
It's your turn to burn, white boy.

54
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:36,387
What's up, J? Drop something?

55
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,857
Just taking care of some business, T.

56
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:46,799
Ford. I heard you was up in Indochina
eating sushi and shit.

57
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:52,633
- I thought sushi came from Japan.
- I know where sushi come from, nigga.

58
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:55,642
I ain't even talking to you.

59
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:02,475
You know I could smash you right now.

60
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:04,711
You and your little tricycle friends.

61
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,880
But I'm gonna give you a pass.

62
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:12,289
Consider it a welcome-home present.

63
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:17,898
Under one condition. Somebody gonna
give my brother a new bike.

64
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:21,002
- I want his bike.
- I ain't giving you shit.

65
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:30,802
There's only one way
you're getting one of these bikes.

66
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,511
I know you been gone a long time, Ford.

67
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:40,952
But not long enough to forget
who run things around here.

68
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:46,055
I hate to see you end up as Dojo's dinner.

69
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:48,620
Trey. One-time.

70
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:55,268
Probably not a good time
to be feeding Dojo anything, huh?

71
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,839
Get that bike from you later.

72
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:06,447
Hey, officer, how's it going?

73
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:08,776
Beautiful day today.

74
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:55,326
- What are you waiting for?
- What you think?

75
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:57,432
Go show these boys how to ride.

76
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,592
- How about a ride?
- This thing might be too much for you.

77
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,671
- We'll never know till I'm on it.
- All right, you too.

78
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,831
It's not that I don't enjoy your company.

79
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:08,938
Just be gentle with him.

80
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,246
- Nice bike.
- Nice ass.

81
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,711
Got a name?

82
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:20,719
Yeah.

83
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:33,133
Ford. What's he doing here?

84
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,574
<i>Forecast for today:</i>
<i>Sun, sun and more sun.</i>

85
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,242
<i>Highs 94 to 103.</i>
<i>Don't forget your sunscreen, folks.</i>

86
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,884
<i>Southwest winds 10 to 15 miles per hour,</i>
<i>with locally higher gusts.</i>

87
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:08,603
Be with you in a second.

88
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:11,765
Looking for something in particular?

89
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:18,477
Yeah, you got one of them seats in a pink
Naugahyde? Maybe with a little gold fringe?

90
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:22,283
You never were funny, Ford.

91
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:25,420
Oh, come on, you used to think
I was funny.

92
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:27,453
Maybe you lost your sense of humor.

93
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,590
I think I have a pretty good sense of humor.

94
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:34,160
Like the morning you skipped town
before agents raided my shop...

95
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,458
...waving warrants, telling me
my boyfriend's a drug dealer?

96
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:40,864
That was funny.
I laughed my ass off for weeks.

97
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:43,266
I wrote you letters.

98
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,636
- I made fires.
- I tried to call.

99
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:50,472
Yeah, but my phone was tapped
for six months. That was fun too.

100
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:54,239
- Can I explain?
- Let me guess.

101
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:58,182
You're sorry, you didn't mean to hurt me,
you were trying to protect me...

102
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:01,380
...and it wasn't your fault.
- It was my fault.

103
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:03,320
- We're closed.
- The sign said...

104
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:07,326
Well, the sign lied. Thanks.

105
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:09,964
You too, Ford.

106
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:18,938
You don't know how many times I've played
this out in my head in the last six months.

107
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:21,866
Must be frustrating.

108
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:27,138
You got balls even coming here.

109
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:32,219
The feds and the Hellions are after you
and Henry James thinks you stole his bikes.

110
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:33,616
Yeah.

111
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:38,389
Well, that's because I did.

112
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:41,992
- Ford?
- Yeah?

113
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:45,664
- Go now, please, before l...
- Before what?

114
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:14,084
And to think we almost decided
to go to the beach this weekend.

115
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:17,721
Lucky for me, Luther hates to swim.

116
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,701
Henry.

117
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,009
I don't know why
you're buying a new seat, Ford.

118
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,805
Looks like you haven't
broken in your old one yet.

119
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,279
Looks like Ford prefers to ride bitch to me.

120
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,045
It looks to me like you ought
to buy a new seat yourself, Henry.

121
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:44,250
Share one with your friends long enough
and you're liable to catch something.

122
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:06,073
Heard you were in Indochina.

123
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,773
Some shit like that.

124
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,445
- Good food there?
- Thailand, actually...

125
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:15,181
...but the food was great.
Thanks for asking.

126
00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:17,621
You're a pretty funny guy, Ford.

127
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:21,157
Tell me...

128
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,491
...you got a punch line for this:

129
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,760
Where are my goddamn bikes?

130
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,036
You really want them...

131
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:32,531
...or what's inside them?

132
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:38,443
Where are they?

133
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:44,117
- Why don't you just cut it out of him.
- No, he won't.

134
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,614
He's too smart for that.

135
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,851
Because he knows if he touches me
he'll never get his shit back.

136
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:53,892
Then again...

137
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:56,321
...l'm not that smart.

138
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:58,295
Shane.

139
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:10,242
You've got till sundown
to hand over my bikes.

140
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:43,234
- Your brother said we had a deal.
- Junior don't do the deals around here, I do.

141
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:49,476
Well, if Junior ain't allowed to make deals,
he shouldn't be allowed to speak.

142
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:54,679
That's funny, because I was
thinking the same thing.

143
00:17:57,459 --> 00:18:01,020
I didn't come here to watch you
pet your dog, primate.

144
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:03,892
I didn't invite your <i>Dukes of Hazzard</i> ass.

145
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:08,298
So you can raise up whenever you feel it.
The answer is no.

146
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,368
You're not slinging your dope on my streets.

147
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:16,768
Hand me that bottle.

148
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:18,742
Look...

149
00:18:19,448 --> 00:18:22,781
...l'm not some dimebag street punk.

150
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:24,782
I'm a businessman.

151
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:29,591
And I'm telling you to make this right.

152
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:33,885
I wouldn't give a shit
if you was Don Corleone himself.

153
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:36,728
The answer is still no.

154
00:18:37,232 --> 00:18:38,597
So get out of my face.

155
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:49,505
What the hell was you looking at?

156
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,442
I love you.

157
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:57,343
Trey, what's wrong? I thought you
would've been down with that shit.

158
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,316
You could've made a killing.

159
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:03,515
First you gonna act a fool
up there on the road, now this?

160
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:05,182
What's wrong with you?

161
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,955
You messing with
my goddamn good nature, boy.

162
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:12,760
Go get me a beer, man.
You messing up my buzz.

163
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:16,795
Get me a Diet Pepsi. Don't slam my door.

164
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:19,497
You better count to 10!

165
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,936
- I'm gonna whup his ass.
- Shut up. Put Rasan and Nomo on him.

166
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:26,342
Dojo got more sense than that boy.

167
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,487
Henry, looks like
you're the one riding bitch.

168
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:59,070
Looks like your engine
could use a little work.

169
00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:02,908
What part of "I don't love you
anymore, you're a bastard...

170
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:06,213
...and I never wanna see you again"
didn't you understand?

171
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:10,624
How about the part that stops you
from driving off right now?

172
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:38,112
Thirsty?

173
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:02,233
All right, one beer. But you're buying.

174
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:17,484
- What up, Junior? You all right?
- No, I'm definitely not all right, man. Move!

175
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,141
Watch out, white boy.

176
00:21:43,318 --> 00:21:45,843
- Call it an accident?
- How about I kick your ass?

177
00:21:46,021 --> 00:21:48,421
No, I prefer we still call it an accident.

178
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:52,452
- How about now?
- Now it looks like you owe me a beer.

179
00:21:53,595 --> 00:21:55,529
- Junior! Junior!
- I'm gonna kill you!

180
00:21:55,697 --> 00:21:57,756
Come on, chill!

181
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:24,889
I'm gonna talk to you. Why you always
got to show your ass, man, huh?

182
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,528
Why you can't come here
and play your position?

183
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:29,357
Look at me, boy.

184
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:33,160
I love you. You're my brother,
but you better stop embarrassing me.

185
00:22:33,335 --> 00:22:35,735
Stop acting so damn crazy.

186
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:38,896
And I got your back for life.

187
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:43,773
Well, if you got my back, then show me,
blood, on everything!

188
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:48,177
You ain't got my back, man. You ain't
got my back, Trey. Forget you, man.

189
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,580
Watch out. Get out of my way, man.

190
00:22:50,752 --> 00:22:54,984
Dawson's Creek almost beat
your brother's ass, blood.

191
00:22:55,157 --> 00:22:58,126
Shut up, man. Go get my dog.

192
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,694
- What're we gonna do about Ford?
- Junior just solved our problem.

193
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:05,299
- Why don't we just grab him right now?
- No, not now.

194
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,868
I got a better idea. Get the boys.

195
00:23:09,037 --> 00:23:13,701
What is it with you, Ford?
Everywhere you go, everything turns to hell.

196
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,366
Yeah, it's a talent I have.

197
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,112
Go powder your nose, China.

198
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:33,394
Let's have some fun.

199
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:52,506
- That's him. Get him.
- There he is.

200
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:04,481
We'd like to thank the Hellions for
messing up another gig. I'm out of here.

201
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:06,884
He ain't going anywhere.

202
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:09,428
- Here he comes.
- There he goes. Get him!

203
00:24:09,598 --> 00:24:11,725
See you, Junior.

204
00:24:35,423 --> 00:24:37,618
Hey, what's up, man?

205
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,321
Hey. What's up?

206
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:45,557
Hey, dude.

207
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:52,197
Damn!

208
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:58,877
You screwed me, Junior.

209
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:04,384
I assume you're apologizing
for setting up a deal you couldn't do.

210
00:25:06,988 --> 00:25:10,947
I made promises based on your black ass.

211
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:22,099
And now I've got a problem.

212
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:27,170
- But you're gonna help me out of it.
- Yo, dog.

213
00:25:28,043 --> 00:25:31,809
Just give me time. I'm gonna talk to Trey.
We could work this out, man.

214
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,471
I could make this happen, all right?

215
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:37,912
Time's up.

216
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:52,899
You know what to do, baby?

217
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:00,264
There's this one road that winds up
the coast from Bangkok to Pattani.

218
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:03,806
It's got mountains on one side,
ocean on the other...

219
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,881
...so close sometimes it feels like
you can just drag your foot in it.

220
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:15,281
I tell you, the last six months, every time
I took that drive I thought about you.

221
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:18,551
Did you come all this way
to sell me a trip to Thailand?

222
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:24,029
You got to the bottom of this beer.
Explain away.

223
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,662
All right.

224
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:33,172
First met Henry about a year ago. I didn't
like him, but he was a paying customer.

225
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,242
I fixed his chopper a couple times.

226
00:26:46,421 --> 00:26:51,358
Six months ago, he turns up at your shop...

227
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:55,087
...with these two bikes.
He asked me if I'd mind looking after them.

228
00:26:55,263 --> 00:26:56,855
I figure,
what the hell, right?

229
00:26:57,565 --> 00:26:59,123
So I do.

230
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:04,534
Then I go to move them, they don't start.
So I check the tanks.

231
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:07,572
They're filled with kilos of crystal meth.

232
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,208
So first thing, I get them out of there.

233
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:14,747
So that's why that fed McPherson
raided my shop after you split.

234
00:27:15,984 --> 00:27:18,919
And you dropped off
the face of the Earth.

235
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,217
I took off...

236
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,424
...so that you wouldn't get dragged into it.

237
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:32,157
I split.

238
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:35,329
Now I'm the only one involved with Henry.

239
00:27:35,503 --> 00:27:37,198
So you left to protect me?

240
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,608
What'd you think, you were gonna just
come back and explain everything...

241
00:27:42,777 --> 00:27:46,838
...and then we'd just ride off
into the sunset together?

242
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:02,489
More or less.

243
00:28:03,498 --> 00:28:06,399
Well, which is it? More or less?

244
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:11,599
Well, I was actually thinking Mexico.

245
00:28:37,365 --> 00:28:39,333
- You're killing me.
- Get your gear on.

246
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:42,163
- Not a good time.
- Heading to Cabo. Shane's coming.

247
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:43,895
- Damn, really?
- Yeah.

248
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:51,270
- Give me 10 minutes, all right?
- Come on.

249
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:56,045
Move.

250
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:58,910
Move, man! Move!

251
00:28:59,687 --> 00:29:01,621
Damn!

252
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:05,059
Wait. That's my brother, man.

253
00:29:05,226 --> 00:29:06,784
It's all right.

254
00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:12,031
Oh, no. No, man.
I'm taking him with me.

255
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,100
You can't do that, son.

256
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,870
Now, we're gonna find out who done this.

257
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:24,476
If you have any ideas who would
want to kill your brother...

258
00:29:24,646 --> 00:29:27,979
If I knew who did this,
you'd have two dead bodies right now.

259
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:31,448
We got a witness.
Says she saw the whole thing.

260
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:34,816
A white male, mid-20s,
rode a custom motorcycle.

261
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:38,584
- Wore black and orange leathers.
- Black and orange leathers?

262
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,661
Hey, you know somebody
who fits that description?

263
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:45,231
Not anymore.

264
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,964
Let's go!

265
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:07,314
FBI. Agent McPherson,
federal gang task force.

266
00:30:07,956 --> 00:30:11,289
Sheriff Barnes.
You don't look like your typical fed.

267
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:16,123
What'd you expect? A cheap suit,
late-model Taurus, a $ 10 haircut?

268
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:18,859
How'd y'all get here so fast?

269
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:22,161
Get this many motorheads
in one place, all wearing colors...

270
00:30:22,337 --> 00:30:24,862
...something's bound to happen.
Pays to be close.

271
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,337
Oh, this is Agent Henderson.

272
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:31,536
Don't let her good looks fool you.
She's one of the best field operatives.

273
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,171
Excuse me, I have to take this.

274
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:40,111
Yeah. Hi, baby.
I'm at a crime scene right now.

275
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:42,552
- It's a typical homicide.
- Typical homicide?

276
00:30:42,724 --> 00:30:45,591
Maybe you can explain to me
what a typical homicide is.

277
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,991
All right, I'll take care of it.
Yeah, I promise.

278
00:30:49,163 --> 00:30:50,858
- I've got an eyewitness.
- You do?

279
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:53,262
- Yeah.
- You've practically got this solved.

280
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,232
I love you too. Jesus Christ.

281
00:30:56,404 --> 00:30:59,339
We've got the murder weapon
and she saw the whole thing.

282
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:01,975
Congratulations.

283
00:31:03,144 --> 00:31:06,705
I don't care if we have to comb
every inch of California.

284
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:12,285
I want that boy Ford, and I want
his head in Dojo's bowl by midnight.

285
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,889
- Amen?
- Amen.

286
00:31:17,525 --> 00:31:19,322
Come on, boy.

287
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,748
Motel policy for cash customers.

288
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:46,318
Jay.

289
00:31:47,088 --> 00:31:48,646
- Got him.
- Son of a bitch.

290
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,383
- I tried to pop Ford six months ago.
- He's cute.

291
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:54,756
You can visit him in prison. Map.

292
00:31:56,364 --> 00:31:58,924
That's why you broke, you eat too much.

293
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,169
- I got it.
- That's okay.

294
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,504
What were you planning on paying with,
your good looks or your smile?

295
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:16,448
I love a girl who can
take care of herself, man.

296
00:32:17,652 --> 00:32:19,745
I would've come back too.

297
00:32:20,788 --> 00:32:22,415
If you boys will excuse me.

298
00:32:24,325 --> 00:32:28,421
It seems like I'm overdue
for some paint and bodywork myself.

299
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,890
So, what are you gonna do about Henry?
We got a plan, right?

300
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:38,335
Yeah, once we're in the clear, I'm gonna tell
Henry where he can pick up his shit.

301
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,505
Of course...

302
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:47,173
...l'm also gonna call that punk
McPherson and tell him.

303
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:49,509
Arrange a get-together with the evidence.

304
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:52,244
That way everybody gets
what they deserve, right?

305
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,116
Henry gets his shit,
McPherson gets Henry...

306
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:57,780
...and we all go to Mexico and get drunk.

307
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,997
<i>As I reported earlier, Wallace, a member</i>
<i>of an Inglewood motorcycle gang...</i>

308
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:08,158
<i>... the Reapers, was brutally murdered</i>
<i>last night with a motorcycle chain.</i>

309
00:33:08,336 --> 00:33:11,828
<i>With the help of an eyewitness,</i>
<i>the FBI has come up with a suspect:</i>

310
00:33:12,006 --> 00:33:14,804
<i>Cary Ford, a white male</i>
<i>in his late 20s.</i>

311
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:17,774
<i>Ford was last seen riding</i>
<i>a black custom motorcycle...</i>

312
00:33:17,945 --> 00:33:20,209
<i>... wearing orange and black</i>
<i>racing leathers.</i>

313
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:22,941
<i>If you have any idea</i>
<i>as to his whereabouts...</i>

314
00:33:23,284 --> 00:33:25,946
<i>... please contact the local authorities.</i>

315
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,216
<i>Cary Ford is now the prime suspect</i>
<i>in the murder of Junior Wallace.</i>

316
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:33,784
Call the sheriff, Hal.

317
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:36,486
Ford was just spotted at Lone Pine.

318
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:38,765
Let's drive a little.

319
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,206
Yeah.

320
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:53,904
<i>Heard on the scanner</i>
<i>they spotted the white boy.</i>

321
00:33:54,082 --> 00:33:57,813
- Dawson's Creek, the white boy.
- <i>All right, get me a map.</i>

322
00:33:59,854 --> 00:34:02,084
We gotta make up some time.

323
00:34:40,394 --> 00:34:42,794
- Yeah?
- <i>Give me Ford.</i>

324
00:34:44,198 --> 00:34:46,826
Ford. It's for you.

325
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,436
- Ford.
- <i>Change in plans.</i>

326
00:34:51,606 --> 00:34:53,506
Seems your buddy Junior's dead.

327
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:54,970
<i>Feds think you did it.</i>

328
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:58,874
Reapers think you did it.
Hell, everybody thinks you did it.

329
00:34:59,046 --> 00:35:01,708
<i>You tell me where my stuff is</i>
<i>and it all goes away.</i>

330
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:03,744
I don't take orders, Henry.

331
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:06,011
- Never have, never will.
- What's that?

332
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,917
Ever heard that what you put out
comes back tenfold?

333
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,821
You spent too much time in Chink Land,
Ford. What does that mean?

334
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:16,521
It means I don't wanna be next to you
when the shit hits the fan.

335
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,255
<i>And by the way, Henry...</i>

336
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:22,300
..."Chink Land" implies China.
I was in Thailand, it's a different country.

337
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,301
Hey, my phone!

338
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,801
Hold it right there.

339
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,276
Everybody down on the ground!

340
00:35:34,448 --> 00:35:36,473
Quit shooting!

341
00:35:36,951 --> 00:35:38,213
You got the wrong guy.

342
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,911
We'll let the sheriff sort it out
when they get here.

343
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:43,852
- Are you okay?
- I got it under control!

344
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,715
I didn't kill anybody.

345
00:35:46,027 --> 00:35:47,892
Shit!

346
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,995
You Earl?

347
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:57,168
Loved your French toast.

348
00:35:59,273 --> 00:36:01,571
- Down.
- Like I said...

349
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:04,802
...I love a girl who can take care of herself.
- Thanks.

350
00:36:04,979 --> 00:36:08,176
You're on the news.
That guy you got in a fight with is dead.

351
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:12,217
- Henry set me up. He wants his drugs back.
- Why don't you give them back.

352
00:36:12,386 --> 00:36:15,583
- It's the only insurance I got.
- You were with me last night.

353
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,656
I'm your alibi. Down, Earl!

354
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:19,554
Tell the cops.

355
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:22,719
Right now it ain't the cops
that I'm worried about.

356
00:36:22,897 --> 00:36:24,159
Not good.

357
00:36:24,332 --> 00:36:26,129
- Reapers!
- He's right, Shane.

358
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,894
You think we could finish
this conversation later?

359
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:34,769
All right. Once we're in the clear,
you call the cops. Agreed?

360
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,209
What should I do with this?

361
00:36:37,378 --> 00:36:41,144
Forget what I said about liking women
who can take care of themselves.

362
00:36:42,683 --> 00:36:46,414
Sorry, it's gonna get crazy.
You'll be safer here than running with us.

363
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:49,249
- See you back in L.A.
- What am I supposed to do?

364
00:36:49,423 --> 00:36:51,391
Hang out with Earl?

365
00:37:08,943 --> 00:37:10,934
Which way?

366
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:13,306
Which way did you say, old man?

367
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,919
- Which way?
- Shortcut!

368
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:27,089
Let's catch them,
kill them and bury them!

369
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:34,030
They're still on us!
Shit! There's more of them!

370
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:36,726
- What are we gonna do, Ford?
- Where we going?

371
00:37:37,905 --> 00:37:39,167
I'm working on it!

372
00:38:03,664 --> 00:38:05,598
Which way did they go?

373
00:38:16,844 --> 00:38:18,505
Damn! Come on!

374
00:38:43,771 --> 00:38:45,102
Now can we call the cops?

375
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:47,069
- No.
- Why not?

376
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,709
Because it's not just the cops,
it's McPherson.

377
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:51,710
McPherson?

378
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:53,642
The guy that tore up your shop.

379
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:55,881
He already thinks I'm a drug dealer.

380
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:59,816
Now he thinks I shot Junior.
And he has no reason to think otherwise...

381
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:03,354
...unless I can prove it.
- Bad just turned to worse. Bent link.

382
00:39:03,524 --> 00:39:05,685
This just keeps getting
better and better.

383
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,824
I got a spare in my toolkit.

384
00:39:10,398 --> 00:39:11,990
He was strangled, by the way.

385
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,733
- Who?
- Junior. He was strangled with a bike chain.

386
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,504
Shit.

387
00:39:20,374 --> 00:39:23,343
Henry used the chain off his own bike.

388
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:28,706
- How do you know that?
- How do you know?

389
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:30,976
Yeah, how did you know that?

390
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,515
Well, it's...

391
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:35,411
It's complicated.

392
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:40,426
- You turning left, or we going to Oregon?
- It's right.

393
00:39:40,594 --> 00:39:41,891
It's right? What...?

394
00:39:42,063 --> 00:39:45,260
Get the finger out of my face.
I know where I'm going.

395
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:50,633
Henry just screwed himself.

396
00:39:51,272 --> 00:39:53,365
- See those scratches and nicks?
- Yeah.

397
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:55,941
Well, it picks them up
from the sprocket.

398
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:59,136
Now, no two bikes
got the same chain-wear pattern...

399
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:02,009
...because no two sprockets
are the same.

400
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,384
So we match the chain
used to kill Junior with Henry's bike...

401
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:09,580
...and we got him.

402
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,315
Like a fingerprint.

403
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,155
Try not to move your lips
so much when you think.

404
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:19,327
Now we call the cops, right?

405
00:40:20,401 --> 00:40:22,266
Now we call the cops.

406
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:27,670
- Real cute, guys.
- Get a room.

407
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:41,145
- <i>McPherson</i>, <i>it's F</i>...
- Ford. Looks like you're trading up.

408
00:40:41,322 --> 00:40:43,984
Going from drug trafficking
to first-degree murder.

409
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:46,683
- <i>I was set up.</i>
- In my business I hear that a lot.

410
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,421
- Loud. Recorder's on.
- Who wants to set you up?

411
00:40:49,597 --> 00:40:51,497
Henry James.

412
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:55,199
Leader of the Hellions.
Now, why would he wanna do that?

413
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:58,031
Those drugs you were looking for
belong to Henry.

414
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:02,039
I stashed them the night before you
raided the shop. He wants them back.

415
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:05,667
Tell me where the drugs are,
I might buy that'd give Henry motive.

416
00:41:05,846 --> 00:41:10,146
- Maybe we can work something out.
- "Maybe" don't cut it. Arrest Henry...

417
00:41:10,317 --> 00:41:13,650
...then I'll take you to the drugs.
- Arrest him? On what grounds?

418
00:41:13,954 --> 00:41:15,216
First-degree murder.

419
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:18,557
- What if I tie the murder weapon to Henry?
- Big "if."

420
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,284
Arrest him.

421
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,189
- Get his bike, I'll show you.
- Get his bike. Okay.

422
00:41:23,364 --> 00:41:27,198
Anyone else you'd like me to arrest?
Ex-girlfriend, second-grade teacher...?

423
00:41:27,368 --> 00:41:30,496
- Hold on, I'm making a list.
- You're not listening to me.

424
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:33,071
- Henry killed Junior.
- I don't know that.

425
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,231
Then you can't help me!

426
00:41:45,986 --> 00:41:47,817
Well, that didn't fly.

427
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:51,116
Screw it. Let's haul ass down
to Mexico and don't look back.

428
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:53,692
As much as I hate to say it,
I agree with him.

429
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:58,362
- We're going to L.A.
- Oh, yeah. That makes sense.

430
00:41:58,532 --> 00:42:01,262
I have to get Henry's bike.
That will clear me.

431
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:05,166
They'll have checkpoints on every
dirt road between here and the coast.

432
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:08,001
We're not exactly hard
to spot driving these.

433
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:12,407
- You wanna ditch the bikes?
- No, I'd rather be fast than invisible.

434
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:17,081
Come on. Wouldn't be any fun
if it was easy, right?

435
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,550
I live my life a quarter mile at a time.

436
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,489
That is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

437
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:43,032
Po-po got the highways
blocked from here to L.A.

438
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,700
L.A.?

439
00:42:44,878 --> 00:42:48,245
Why would he go to the one place
he know I got on lockdown?

440
00:42:48,415 --> 00:42:51,748
- Let's catch him on the interstate.
- No, he's smarter than that.

441
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:53,409
He trying to backdoor us.

442
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,478
He going through the Palms.

443
00:42:56,123 --> 00:42:58,921
That's the way I'd go.
And that's the way we going.

444
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:11,227
You know, Henry James did pull six months
in L.A. County last year for possession.

445
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:13,937
Maybe Ford is onto something.

446
00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:19,335
<i>Then you can't help me!</i>

447
00:43:21,382 --> 00:43:23,907
Call in. Check everything
from Lone Pine and L.A.

448
00:43:24,084 --> 00:43:27,781
- You think Ford's going back to L.A.?
- He's going after Henry James.

449
00:43:27,955 --> 00:43:31,550
If he's right and Henry did set him up,
that's what I'd do. Let's go!

450
00:43:31,725 --> 00:43:34,717
- You have to pay for the gas.
- Oh, right.

451
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,510
Reapers!

452
00:44:03,857 --> 00:44:06,257
- We'll lose them in the Palms!
- Are you crazy?

453
00:44:06,427 --> 00:44:07,894
I hate it when he does this!

454
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:12,328
- They going into the trees!
- I could see that, fool! Stay on Ford.

455
00:44:39,293 --> 00:44:42,023
- I got his ass!
- They're shooting at us, Ford!

456
00:44:42,196 --> 00:44:43,458
- I know!
- What do we do?

457
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,325
Go right! They'll follow me!

458
00:45:18,265 --> 00:45:19,960
Meet the twins!

459
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:38,810
All right, Ford!

460
00:45:39,887 --> 00:45:41,980
Just you and me, baby!

461
00:46:08,578 --> 00:46:10,705
Shouldn't pick on girls.

462
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:13,324
You all right?

463
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:20,800
I just jumped my bike
onto the roof of a moving train.

464
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:24,235
It's amazing what you can do
when you have no choice.

465
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:31,510
Where are Val and Dalton?

466
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:35,848
He had me, dog. He had me.
I was gone!

467
00:49:36,219 --> 00:49:38,949
He's the one snatched me up out of there!

468
00:49:39,122 --> 00:49:42,319
I'm trying to figure out why.
He ain't acting like no killer!

469
00:49:42,492 --> 00:49:45,052
Your brother's dead
and cracker's on the run.

470
00:49:45,228 --> 00:49:49,562
Shit don't feel right.
Don't sound right, don't look right.

471
00:49:49,732 --> 00:49:52,496
Only way we can find out
is to get our hands on him.

472
00:49:52,668 --> 00:49:55,865
- I'm with that.
- Then get your black ass up and let's go!

473
00:49:56,038 --> 00:49:57,665
Everybody, let's go!

474
00:50:09,185 --> 00:50:11,312
First time Val's beat you anywhere!

475
00:50:11,487 --> 00:50:13,614
Must be the chick.

476
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:16,418
Yeah, I stopped for a manicure.

477
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:21,595
Want this hour's bad news?
Every major road in L.A. Is blocked.

478
00:50:22,465 --> 00:50:25,400
I know you said it wouldn't be any fun
if it was easy...

479
00:50:25,568 --> 00:50:28,196
...but does it have to be this much fun?

480
00:50:35,311 --> 00:50:37,745
You said you could make this
go away. How?

481
00:50:37,914 --> 00:50:42,112
Sometimes witnesses
forget what they saw.

482
00:50:42,285 --> 00:50:44,219
Refuse to testify.

483
00:50:44,387 --> 00:50:46,082
You still want your shit back...

484
00:50:46,255 --> 00:50:49,588
...l'll call you when I get to L.A.
3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

485
00:50:52,962 --> 00:50:54,725
What?

486
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:02,734
Jay, something doesn't sit with me.
Ford doesn't profile up as a killer.

487
00:51:02,905 --> 00:51:05,806
Yeah? Good instincts, Henderson.

488
00:51:05,975 --> 00:51:10,571
Listen, I gave Ford a chance
to tell the truth six months ago. He ran.

489
00:51:10,746 --> 00:51:13,408
I gave him another chance last night.
He ran again.

490
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:18,486
Innocent men, Henderson, don't run.

491
00:51:20,456 --> 00:51:21,718
He went for it!

492
00:51:21,891 --> 00:51:25,918
Now we just gotta get past the several
hundred cops between us and L.A.

493
00:51:26,095 --> 00:51:28,859
God, I hope you have a plan this time.

494
00:51:31,467 --> 00:51:33,094
Yeah, I got a plan.

495
00:51:56,425 --> 00:51:58,620
You gonna leave without me?

496
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:08,832
Oh, my God.

497
00:52:09,805 --> 00:52:11,796
Check it out, man.

498
00:52:12,775 --> 00:52:14,606
Holy shit.

499
00:52:20,616 --> 00:52:24,712
Seen three bikers and a chick on a couple
of crotch rockets in the last hour?

500
00:52:27,089 --> 00:52:29,148
Must be something in the water up here.

501
00:52:29,325 --> 00:52:33,227
Okay. Words strung together
into sentences obviously bewilder you.

502
00:52:33,396 --> 00:52:35,330
Let me try again.

503
00:52:36,065 --> 00:52:37,965
Three dudes...

504
00:52:38,501 --> 00:52:40,560
...a girl...

505
00:52:40,736 --> 00:52:42,670
...and a couple of bikes.

506
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:48,332
- Don't know. Seen a lot of truckers.
- Really?

507
00:52:48,711 --> 00:52:50,406
One girl.

508
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:53,749
- Man, you should've seen the pair...
- Shut up.

509
00:52:56,586 --> 00:52:57,848
Does this thing work?

510
00:53:06,596 --> 00:53:09,531
Ford. What is wrong with you?

511
00:53:09,699 --> 00:53:11,394
Sorry.

512
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:13,660
- Is it fried?
- Yeah.

513
00:53:24,847 --> 00:53:28,840
So you never actually told me
why you chose Thailand.

514
00:53:30,953 --> 00:53:35,151
Well, I just wanted to go someplace
that wouldn't remind me of you.

515
00:53:36,058 --> 00:53:37,616
Oh, yeah?

516
00:53:37,793 --> 00:53:40,318
How did that work out for you?

517
00:53:42,431 --> 00:53:45,298
- Not real well.
- No?

518
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:48,832
Oh, come on, admit it.

519
00:53:49,271 --> 00:53:51,705
You're so glad I came back.

520
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:56,542
I just had nothing better to do
this weekend.

521
00:54:00,249 --> 00:54:02,809
Why we stopping
in the middle of the interstate?

522
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:04,981
Roadblock.

523
00:54:05,421 --> 00:54:08,720
Sir! You're clear. Go ahead.
Move it out.

524
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:11,422
Go ahead and send the next one!

525
00:54:12,762 --> 00:54:15,094
Check the second one back!

526
00:54:15,264 --> 00:54:19,132
- Good evening, officer.
- Could you step out of the vehicle, please.

527
00:54:19,301 --> 00:54:23,067
- There a problem?
- No, sir. Just a routine check.

528
00:54:25,074 --> 00:54:28,407
- You mind opening her up?
- No, not at all.

529
00:54:36,218 --> 00:54:39,346
- Where you coming from?
- Barstow.

530
00:54:39,522 --> 00:54:43,458
- Much drier in Barstow.
- Yeah, just a little.

531
00:54:50,933 --> 00:54:53,367
Hey, Ed!
What are you doing back so soon?

532
00:54:53,602 --> 00:54:55,968
I got a race in L.A. Tomorrow night.

533
00:54:56,439 --> 00:55:00,307
He's all right.
Regular hero here on the local circuit.

534
00:55:00,476 --> 00:55:02,910
- Let him through.
- Yes, sir.

535
00:55:03,245 --> 00:55:05,975
Hey, Ed, good luck tomorrow night.

536
00:55:07,116 --> 00:55:10,051
- Beat it.
- Thanks, Frank.

537
00:55:47,123 --> 00:55:49,387
Ford should've called us by now.

538
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:55,822
He's just having a good run.
Don't sweat it, man.

539
00:55:58,567 --> 00:56:00,296
We got over a mil riding on this!

540
00:56:00,469 --> 00:56:03,961
We're looking at life in prison if Ford
doesn't go down as planned.

541
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,732
Don't tell me not to sweat it.

542
00:56:09,845 --> 00:56:13,178
So grab yourself a candy bar
and shut your mouth.

543
00:56:32,234 --> 00:56:35,362
That's a sweet hog, man.
Look at that beast!

544
00:56:36,005 --> 00:56:38,371
Live to ride. Or that. Yeah.

545
00:56:39,809 --> 00:56:41,800
Could we get a picture of you guys?

546
00:56:41,977 --> 00:56:45,743
We're on a road trip, we e-mail people
on our buddy list where we're at.

547
00:56:45,915 --> 00:56:47,542
Could we do that?
Who's in love?

548
00:56:47,716 --> 00:56:48,978
- They are.
- Right there.

549
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,619
Give me a big smile,
like you guys are human.

550
00:56:51,887 --> 00:56:55,015
He blinked and she blinked.
Look at this. Let's do it again.

551
00:56:55,191 --> 00:56:57,421
This time, no blinking.

552
00:57:05,701 --> 00:57:07,259
Smile.

553
00:57:12,274 --> 00:57:13,901
Now what?

554
00:57:23,853 --> 00:57:26,617
It's also about financial freedom.

555
00:57:30,192 --> 00:57:33,525
- What can I do for you?
- Why don't you open up the back for me.

556
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:38,424
That's a long truck.

557
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,901
Don't touch me.

558
00:57:49,411 --> 00:57:51,106
- That's weird.
- What?

559
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,907
My lock's gone.

560
00:58:17,439 --> 00:58:19,031
You waiting for a green light?

561
00:58:31,453 --> 00:58:35,116
- Let's go, make a hole!
- Truck's broke. Call a tow truck.

562
00:58:37,026 --> 00:58:39,688
- Are you done?
- Get in. I'm driving.

563
00:58:42,564 --> 00:58:43,826
Fuck the police!

564
00:58:43,999 --> 00:58:45,933
- Was that a threat?
- I think it was.

565
00:59:20,502 --> 00:59:22,436
Ford, traffic!

566
00:59:26,642 --> 00:59:28,872
This is why I hate four wheels.

567
00:59:29,378 --> 00:59:31,573
Hey, you're gonna have to
make a break!

568
00:59:31,747 --> 00:59:35,274
- We go together!
- No, you and Val can get Shane out of this!

569
00:59:35,451 --> 00:59:36,884
No way, I'm going with you!

570
00:59:46,061 --> 00:59:48,894
- No, you're not.
- Goddamn it, Ford!

571
00:59:56,805 --> 00:59:59,069
I always knew you had a thing for me.

572
01:00:00,476 --> 01:00:01,966
Get her out of here!

573
01:00:07,616 --> 01:00:09,447
Hey!

574
01:00:19,561 --> 01:00:20,550
Watch out.

575
01:00:23,932 --> 01:00:28,369
And I'm not gonna stand for it. I wanna
return the bike. You can take it back.

576
01:00:34,109 --> 01:00:38,569
What do you mean I can't bring it back?
Okay, there's only 200 miles on the bike.

577
01:00:38,747 --> 01:00:40,977
If you say one more word...

578
01:00:47,656 --> 01:00:49,385
Asshole!

579
01:00:49,558 --> 01:00:51,958
Hello? Hung up again!

580
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:04,195
- Bikers.
- This is crazy! We can call backup.

581
01:01:04,373 --> 01:01:08,207
If you don't like my driving, Henderson,
you can get out and hitch.

582
01:01:17,252 --> 01:01:19,152
No way!

583
01:01:28,263 --> 01:01:31,494
Thank God for airbags. Shut up.

584
01:02:12,274 --> 01:02:14,242
- Come on, Ford.
- You got this wrong!

585
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:31,615
Damn!

586
01:02:43,572 --> 01:02:46,405
Damn! Crazy white boy!

587
01:02:46,808 --> 01:02:49,038
Look, man, I don't wanna...

588
01:02:53,415 --> 01:02:56,111
You think you man enough
to drop that hammer?

589
01:02:56,285 --> 01:02:59,516
Don't want to.
I didn't kill Junior either.

590
01:02:59,688 --> 01:03:02,122
If I did, I would've
let you die at the tracks.

591
01:03:02,291 --> 01:03:07,593
- Why didn't you stick around and talk?
- I didn't think this would go all that well.

592
01:03:09,097 --> 01:03:11,725
All right.
You didn't kill him, who did?

593
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:15,028
Henry James. He set me up.

594
01:03:17,639 --> 01:03:20,335
So I'm supposed to just believe
what you say now?

595
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:23,501
Well, see for yourself.
I'm taking him down.

596
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,979
You don't believe me,
you can always shoot me then.

597
01:03:30,652 --> 01:03:32,210
You dropped this.

598
01:03:39,394 --> 01:03:41,954
This better be someone
with good news or money.

599
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:46,533
What would you say if I gave you Junior's
killer and Henry's drugs at the same time?

600
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:49,526
Where?

601
01:03:49,705 --> 01:03:53,698
You know the address. You busted its doors
down about six months ago.

602
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:55,843
Meet me there in two hours.

603
01:04:21,603 --> 01:04:23,400
Crystal meth.

604
01:04:30,879 --> 01:04:33,507
I don't suppose we got
a spare set of hands?

605
01:04:42,357 --> 01:04:44,587
- Yeah?
- Don't "yeah" me.

606
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,557
How we doing over there?

607
01:04:46,728 --> 01:04:48,525
It's just me and the fishes, man.

608
01:04:48,697 --> 01:04:50,824
If a mermaid pops up, I'll call you.

609
01:04:56,805 --> 01:04:59,103
- Just stay there at Dalton's.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

610
01:04:59,274 --> 01:05:01,105
It's lovely here.

611
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:03,301
I'll see you in a little while.

612
01:05:03,478 --> 01:05:04,945
Just be careful, all right?

613
01:05:05,113 --> 01:05:08,207
- Well, you know me.
- Yeah, that's why I'm worried.

614
01:05:09,318 --> 01:05:11,183
I'll call you when it's over.

615
01:05:19,161 --> 01:05:22,289
- Who the hell is that?
- I ordered pizza.

616
01:05:23,832 --> 01:05:25,959
- You're kidding me, right?
- No.

617
01:05:27,102 --> 01:05:29,434
- You're not kidding?
- I eat when I'm nervous.

618
01:05:29,604 --> 01:05:32,664
He eats when he's horny.
He just likes to eat.

619
01:05:36,745 --> 01:05:38,576
How you doing?

620
01:05:45,454 --> 01:05:47,183
Seems like your boy ain't coming.

621
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:50,485
Now what?

622
01:05:52,361 --> 01:05:54,693
He'll be here. Trust me.

623
01:05:55,897 --> 01:05:59,424
Tell me you got a million dollars'
worth of my ice?

624
01:05:59,901 --> 01:06:01,630
I'd try to be punctual.

625
01:06:02,904 --> 01:06:04,303
You ain't Henry.

626
01:06:45,747 --> 01:06:47,044
He'll be here.

627
01:06:47,716 --> 01:06:50,549
You know, I ain't exactly
known for my patience.

628
01:06:58,994 --> 01:07:01,292
- What's this?
- Y2K.

629
01:07:03,331 --> 01:07:05,196
Fastest bike in the world.

630
01:07:05,367 --> 01:07:10,168
Carbon-fiber chassis built around
a Rolls-Royce jet helicopter engine.

631
01:07:11,106 --> 01:07:13,870
Zero to 200 in less than 10 seconds, huh?

632
01:07:15,477 --> 01:07:17,707
I heard of these.

633
01:07:18,413 --> 01:07:22,372
- What's wrong with this one?
- I don't own it.

634
01:07:22,551 --> 01:07:26,510
- FBI! Hands where I can see them!
- Drop it. Hands behind your head.

635
01:07:26,688 --> 01:07:29,316
- You tried to set me up.
- They're here for Henry.

636
01:07:29,491 --> 01:07:32,187
Put the gun on the ground
and slide it to me, now.

637
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:36,592
You're supposed to wait for Henry.
Didn't you learn anything in FBI school?

638
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:39,256
Ford, shut up.

639
01:07:42,237 --> 01:07:43,932
Those Henry's bikes?

640
01:07:44,105 --> 01:07:46,039
- Yeah.
- And the meth's inside them?

641
01:07:46,374 --> 01:07:48,535
- Yeah.
- Then...

642
01:07:49,211 --> 01:07:50,906
...nice work.

643
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:54,711
Hey. Nancy Drew.

644
01:07:57,586 --> 01:08:01,488
"No. Don't shoot. Stop."

645
01:08:01,656 --> 01:08:05,217
What a sad and sudden tragedy.

646
01:08:06,228 --> 01:08:09,959
Nice shot, by the way.
Seriously. So now...

647
01:08:10,131 --> 01:08:12,895
...I get to pin this murder on you...

648
01:08:13,068 --> 01:08:17,004
...and, well, everyone knows
you killed Junior...

649
01:08:17,172 --> 01:08:20,300
...so now
I can shoot you both.

650
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:23,509
- Shit.
- Yeah.

651
01:08:23,678 --> 01:08:27,739
- Which one of you guys wants to go first?
- Him. Shoot him first.

652
01:08:29,584 --> 01:08:31,882
You sure the drugs are in there?

653
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:42,060
- Hey.
- They're wired.

654
01:08:44,533 --> 01:08:47,058
You put the gun on the ground
or we all go up.

655
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:54,499
It's my girlfriend. Excuse me. Sorry.

656
01:08:54,676 --> 01:08:56,507
Hey, baby. I'm fine.

657
01:08:56,678 --> 01:08:59,511
Why don't you come in? All right.

658
01:09:00,348 --> 01:09:02,077
You're gonna love her.

659
01:09:17,465 --> 01:09:19,695
Meet my partner.

660
01:09:21,069 --> 01:09:25,130
Did you really think I was stupid enough
to walk into a trap?

661
01:09:26,174 --> 01:09:27,801
Wait.

662
01:09:28,143 --> 01:09:29,770
Say hello, bitch.

663
01:09:32,414 --> 01:09:33,779
Shane.

664
01:09:36,284 --> 01:09:38,081
Look who it is.

665
01:09:38,253 --> 01:09:42,314
Guess the lunch line's gonna be
a little shorter at family reunions.

666
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:44,390
Huh, dog?

667
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,054
I should have done your ass
when I did your bitch brother.

668
01:09:48,296 --> 01:09:50,662
Yeah, you should have.

669
01:09:51,566 --> 01:09:53,193
Really?

670
01:09:55,236 --> 01:09:58,728
All right. It seems we
have ourselves a little dilemma.

671
01:09:59,207 --> 01:10:03,701
Give me my meth or your little girlfriend
is gonna redefine the term "airhead."

672
01:10:03,878 --> 01:10:06,073
Now, drop that switch.

673
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:14,548
Who knows, baby?

674
01:10:14,723 --> 01:10:18,921
After a little time with us,
she might not wanna go back to Ford.

675
01:10:25,066 --> 01:10:27,864
Go ahead, take a moment.
We have plenty of time.

676
01:10:38,013 --> 01:10:40,846
Requesting backup
at 12000 North Alameda Street.

677
01:11:34,269 --> 01:11:35,566
Thanks.

678
01:11:44,312 --> 01:11:45,574
No, no, no!

679
01:11:46,181 --> 01:11:47,842
Hey, wait!

680
01:12:04,966 --> 01:12:06,593
Now, ain't that ironic?

681
01:12:18,246 --> 01:12:21,374
- You okay?
- Yeah. Where's Henry?

682
01:12:21,549 --> 01:12:25,007
- I gotta get that bike.
- I gotta get that bitch.

683
01:12:25,186 --> 01:12:26,483
Damn right.

684
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:44,831
- You Power Rangers all right?
- That hurt.

685
01:12:45,006 --> 01:12:46,667
- Hey.
- Jay!

686
01:12:46,841 --> 01:12:49,401
Bulletproof vest, asshole.

687
01:12:49,644 --> 01:12:51,168
Shit! Let's go!

688
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:54,408
You were always a punk.

689
01:13:17,405 --> 01:13:20,067
- Going somewhere?
- You want some of this, bitch?

690
01:13:20,241 --> 01:13:22,175
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

691
01:15:03,478 --> 01:15:05,173
You messed with the wrong chick!

692
01:15:13,454 --> 01:15:15,615
Looks like you did, bitch.

693
01:17:18,079 --> 01:17:19,944
Need a ride?

694
01:17:38,032 --> 01:17:41,160
- You all right?
- I'll live.

695
01:17:42,336 --> 01:17:45,100
This is Henry's sprocket.
It should match the chain...

696
01:17:45,273 --> 01:17:48,868
Your friends just told me.
Could we maybe do this later?

697
01:17:52,914 --> 01:17:55,712
All these dead white folks around here.

698
01:17:56,684 --> 01:17:58,447
So it look like we done, huh?

699
01:18:02,457 --> 01:18:05,949
- I'm sorry about your brother.
- Yeah.

700
01:18:06,461 --> 01:18:10,522
I gotta get out of here. Me and Johnny Law
ain't on a first-name basis.

701
01:18:10,698 --> 01:18:12,222
Hey.

702
01:18:13,468 --> 01:18:15,231
- What?
- Thanks.

703
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:18,996
Don't sweat it, man.
Just do me one favor.

704
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:22,741
- What's that?
- Keep your ass out of Inglewood.

705
01:18:36,991 --> 01:18:41,155
This shop was the only thing
in the world that was really mine.

706
01:18:42,196 --> 01:18:45,529
Do you have any idea how long
it took me to save up for it?

707
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:47,691
I'm sorry, Shane.

708
01:18:47,935 --> 01:18:50,870
You're in the clear,
so I guess you got what you wanted.

709
01:19:01,916 --> 01:19:05,147
You're looking at the only reason
that I came back.

710
01:19:06,254 --> 01:19:08,119
I'm betting on more days like that.

711
01:19:10,758 --> 01:19:14,091
You know what you could do for me, Ford?

712
01:19:17,098 --> 01:19:19,589
Take me to Mexico.

713
01:19:28,442 --> 01:19:30,876
- Where we heading?
- South.

714
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:33,979
I got someone to pick up.

715
01:19:39,053 --> 01:19:40,315
Let's ride.

716
01:23:53,607 --> 01:23:55,598
