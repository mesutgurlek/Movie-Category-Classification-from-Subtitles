1
00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:19,907
Oh bloody useless.
Just give me that

2
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:54,221
I suppose we should cover her

3
00:02:57,321 --> 00:02:57,971
Yes

4
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:38,621
Let's call an ambulance

5
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:40,571
Right

6
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:12,621
So?

7
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:15,971
They're not a hurry I
told they she was dead

8
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:32,371
- No eggs this morning?
- I forgot to buy eggs

9
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:51,721
Get off

10
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:54,221
Quick

11
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:03,571
<i>That's good</i>

12
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:07,421
You didn't see anything?

13
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:26,721
Wait

14
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:33,021
OK

15
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:06,421
- What do the police think?
- The sergeant doesn't know

16
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:09,071
It was not a murder, there
are no marks on the body

17
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:10,921
You had a good look then

18
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:14,221
You can't keep your eyes off
women even when she's dead

19
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:26,621
I think she fell on water

20
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,321
So how do you explain
she was half naked?

21
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:34,021
May be she was drunk

22
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:37,771
May be she wander
on boats or something

23
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:40,471
May be she was pregnant

24
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:44,071
Right

25
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,221
Don't worry, it's
just the drink

26
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:15,521
What do you think, Joe?

27
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:18,471
- About what?
- The dead

28
00:07:22,171 --> 00:07:24,621
I think she went to
the bridge fully dressed

29
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,421
To breath the warm night air

30
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:33,221
Then she took off her jacket
and put it on the ground

31
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,721
And then she
unbuttoned her blouse

32
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:40,921
And then she lifted
up her brassieres

33
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:43,971
And dropped it down on
top of other clothes

34
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:50,671
An she undone button of her skirt,
and it slipped down over her hips.

35
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:55,186
Then she undone her stockings

36
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:00,270
And hold them up so they blew in the breeze
before she let them flew off into the night

37
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:04,771
And she shivered

38
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:07,521
She wondered if she
really wanted to do it

39
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,621
She answered this question by
kicking her clothes into the river

40
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:13,871
And horridly now she take off
her garter and her knickers

41
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:17,421
And there she be,
standing in a petticoat

42
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,121
Thinking over what
brought her to this

43
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:26,021
And the with
particle below her

44
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:28,371
She dropped into
the river like a rose

45
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:31,271
And float there for a moment

46
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,971
And begone

47
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:40,471
What kind of
women would do that?

48
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:42,521
Just an ordinary woman

49
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:47,171
You are going to sit
there all day drinking tea?

50
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:05,271
Hi

51
00:09:09,621 --> 00:09:12,471
Sign here and don't dirt it

52
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:19,621
You are the one
who found the girl?

53
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:22,071
Right

54
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:25,021
There are evil
men in this town

55
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:59,421
- How come you get so little water?
- Shut your mouth

56
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:05,371
Come on, Jim. This way

57
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,021
There's a good pub in Leers.

58
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:42,971
We should go there
for a game of darts

59
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:44,071
Right

60
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:56,521
Joe challange me to
a game of darts.

61
00:11:58,121 --> 00:12:00,771
- You play darts?
- Sometimes

62
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,671
Just to pass the time

63
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:06,021
You don't find anything more
interesting to spend the time?

64
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:09,071
I can tell one or two thing
but not in front of a kid

65
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:12,071
Don't you laugh to yourself

66
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:15,571
- What is so funny?
- Eat your potato.

67
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:21,521
All of it

68
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:39,671
- Don't kick me, mom
- Stop yelling

69
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:45,321
You finished, Joe?

70
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:56,371
May be they'll say something in the
evening newspapers about that body

71
00:14:57,371 --> 00:14:59,271
Do you think they'll
write about us?

72
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:00,521
No

73
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:08,021
Myself and Joe picked up a
body from the river this morning

74
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:11,221
- Naked
- Murder

75
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:13,821
Possible. She
had no clothes on

76
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,671
- Was she cut?
- Not a mark on her

77
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:18,571
Here we are

78
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:23,671
A body of a dead woman was found
in the River Clay this morning

79
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:26,321
The woman was wearing
only a thin petticoat

80
00:15:26,371 --> 00:15:28,436
So far she was unidentified

81
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:30,921
- Police...
- You said she was naked

82
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:33,371
The same thing,
it was transparent

83
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:36,271
Les, I've got a headache,
I'm going back to the barge

84
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:38,971
- Another game of darts?
- Another time

85
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:42,521
I'll give you a game

86
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:12,171
Where's Les?

87
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:16,271
He's found someone
to play darts with

88
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,071
He'll be here at least an hour

89
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,021
We'll wake the boy

90
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:43,371
Why don't we go up on deck?

91
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,471
I'm not going any further

92
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:23,421
Police are
investigating that woman

93
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,687
There's a bit in the
newspaper about its

94
00:18:32,675 --> 00:18:34,825
What makes you think of that?

95
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,199
Something to say

96
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:42,549
You have done enough
talking for one night

97
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,299
Are you sorry?

98
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:49,349
That's not good, do we?

99
00:19:05,449 --> 00:19:07,249
It's pity if he's coming back

100
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:08,749
What?

101
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:12,699
It's pity if he's coming back

102
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:16,799
The bunk there

103
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:24,099
You're nice, Joe

104
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,799
You hungry? I'll
fry you an egg

105
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,449
No, not now

106
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:41,149
I'll take a cup of tea though

107
00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:17,499
- You two are bloody quiet
- Same as you, no?

108
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,749
- What's up Les?
- I know fine well what's up

109
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:23,749
He's lost money at darts again. And he
came back here to try to take out at me

110
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:26,499
- Listen woman...
- You shut your damned mouth, Leslie Gold!

111
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:28,149
You have no rights
to yell at me

112
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:31,049
I have never lost
money at darts

113
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:32,499
You are a liar!

114
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:43,849
- Tea is ready?
- You in a hurry?

115
00:20:43,884 --> 00:20:46,349
The tea is ready
when it's ready

116
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,099
You read that they
wrote in the papers

117
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,014
They didn't mention about us

118
00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:57,449
I am not really
interested in any of that

119
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:11,499
- Have you been swimming?
- I don't swim

120
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:18,499
How about you?

121
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,949
I don't have a
swimming costume

122
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:28,799
You are here on holiday?

123
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:31,249
It's free day today

124
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,349
What's your name?

125
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:41,008
Cathie

126
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,749
Would you like to go with
me for a walk, Cathie?

127
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:51,299
Where to?

128
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:54,199
Over there

129
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,199
Tim's over board!

130
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:36,199
The boy is
overboard, Ella. Help

131
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,449
- You alright?
- Right

132
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,099
Thank you.

133
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:19,825
Thanks, Joe

134
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:38,549
- Look at that
- A funfair. Can we go there?

135
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,849
You can ask your mom

136
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,899
Ella. Look at that

137
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:56,099
May be we go there with Tim?

138
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,749
- I've my work to do. You take him
- I'll stay aboard if you want to go

139
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:04,099
I have no time. You go

140
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:08,949
Come along, Joe?
Stretch for your legs

141
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:11,399
Yes, all right

142
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,399
Here we are

143
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:27,249
Watch me

144
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:34,099
- Yes, yes, that one!
- Got it

145
00:27:34,134 --> 00:27:35,499
2 pence.

146
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:37,499
You see, I always win

147
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:40,049
How do you like it, son?

148
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:44,949
- And that's it
- You are touching the line, sorry

149
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:48,499
- Excuse me, I was not touching the line
- You touched the line

150
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,914
What are you doing here?

151
00:27:54,949 --> 00:27:58,149
- I'm working here now
- Right, right, Bob. This is Joe Huggy.

152
00:27:58,184 --> 00:27:59,766
He works with us
couple of months

153
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:01,314
- Nice to meet you, Joe.
- Me too

154
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:04,799
Me and Les, we used to
work on the same boat

155
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,049
- Never the same shipyard
- No

156
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:09,849
- That was good time?
- Yes

157
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,949
2 pence.

158
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:14,414
Bob, here is my son, Jim.

159
00:28:14,449 --> 00:28:17,349
- Jim, this is Bob.
- We close the game

160
00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:20,464
<i>I don't want to go
back to the barge</i>

161
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:23,699
Do you want to go to the picture?
There are two of them in town

162
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:25,516
- Do you want to go to the picture?
- Yae

163
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:27,264
Joe, do you want to
go to the picture?

164
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:30,799
No, no. I'll walk into town
then go back to the barge

165
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:33,249
Let make it quick

166
00:28:55,449 --> 00:28:58,399
Go, Joe. I don't
want to see you

167
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:00,749
Go

168
00:29:17,699 --> 00:29:20,649
Look what you've done

169
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:25,849
Give it to me

170
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:40,249
It's broken

171
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:54,849
Hello, Joe.

172
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:56,299
Hello, Cathie.

173
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,849
What are you doing here?

174
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:06,899
- I'm working here by the river
- You are working?

175
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:10,449
Joe Taylor condescend to
mix with the working class?

176
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:12,899
I don't take any pride in it

177
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,649
I see you never
made it to China

178
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:25,599
- Your flat is still there?
- Yes

179
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:28,549
I've got a flat mate now

180
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,299
Is she nice?

181
00:31:31,449 --> 00:31:33,199
I don't see her much

182
00:31:35,949 --> 00:31:38,299
Why barge, Joe?

183
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:41,599
You can find work
more glamorous

184
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:45,399
Just sort of have it, really

185
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:50,549
- What about you, you still at the office?
- Yes

186
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:55,149
Nothing's really changed

187
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,299
Except us

188
00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:09,649
- What did you do with all my stuff?
- I threw them away

189
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:13,099
As you told me to

190
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,099
I thought I would
never see you again

191
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:43,599
- Hi gentlemen
- Go, Joe.

192
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:47,599
- You sure?
- I'm scaling a little

193
00:35:47,634 --> 00:35:49,949
It'll get hot in an hour

194
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,199
Joe, get some sacs of coal

195
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:19,149
- Tim!
- Easy said than done

196
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:21,499
We continue?

197
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:24,099
Put it in the back
of the truck, Joe.

198
00:37:24,749 --> 00:37:27,099
- It's in your truck now
- Thanks

199
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:29,449
What about the boy

200
00:37:30,049 --> 00:37:33,949
- Will you come to see him?
- He'll be back in school again next week

201
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:38,399
I have some surprise for you

202
00:37:40,249 --> 00:37:41,449
A banana!

203
00:37:41,649 --> 00:37:44,249
- What should you say?
- Thank you, uncle Sam.

204
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:49,349
- Thanks
- Will you talk about the naked lady?

205
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,099
- Yes, some pervert has done it
- Me and Joe found her

206
00:37:53,134 --> 00:37:55,549
- You're joking
- We called the police

207
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,549
Will you stop
talking about this?

208
00:37:57,799 --> 00:37:59,799
All talk about it

209
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,099
Drink your tea

210
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:10,199
Say bye to your dad

211
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,999
- Bye, dad
- Bye, son. Take care of yourself

212
00:39:18,449 --> 00:39:20,449
- Take care
- Bye

213
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:02,849
You're sad about Tim?

214
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:07,399
He needs an education.

215
00:40:08,649 --> 00:40:12,499
But when he goes
away It breaks my heart

216
00:42:14,249 --> 00:42:18,149
<i>Think of me when you look at
yourself. With undying love, C.</i>

217
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,099
I had a dream
about you yesterday

218
00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:29,799
I don't think for months

219
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:35,099
- I think you have gone away
- I had gone away

220
00:42:35,899 --> 00:42:38,699
I shed my own skin
and hide in the fog

221
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:43,149
I am pregnant

222
00:42:44,149 --> 00:42:45,499
It's yours

223
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:49,299
Two months has gone

224
00:42:52,549 --> 00:42:56,999
- Two months and you wanted me out of your life?
- This isn't going to happen

225
00:42:57,999 --> 00:43:00,449
Is there anything you
want me to do about it?

226
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:04,649
I just thought
you should know who

227
00:43:07,749 --> 00:43:11,199
You could marry me and we'll
make wonderful babies together

228
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,049
Kid is not exactly I see it

229
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,064
Why not, Joe? What
are you afraid of?

230
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:22,099
There's a kid in the barge and I spent every
moment I want to kick him out of the sight

231
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:25,049
You don't have to be like that
We'll work out intelligently

232
00:43:25,149 --> 00:43:26,814
It's not about us

233
00:43:26,849 --> 00:43:29,599
It's about what
kids do to people

234
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:34,149
Cathie, I am not someone you
want to marry and you know that

235
00:43:44,049 --> 00:43:46,749
- Have you been seeing anyone else?
- It's your child, Joe.

236
00:43:46,784 --> 00:43:48,949
That doesn't
answer my question

237
00:43:53,149 --> 00:43:55,299
His name is Dan,
he's a plumber

238
00:43:57,049 --> 00:43:59,849
He's nice but I'm not
really interested in him

239
00:43:59,899 --> 00:44:02,499
- He's married anyway
- That's why you said it's mine

240
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:04,499
It's the truth

241
00:44:05,649 --> 00:44:07,449
I have to get
back to the barge

242
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,099
Don't run away, we can
sort it out together

243
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:12,324
No, we can't. I'm
not yours anymore

244
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,499
That's not true

245
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:17,124
We were right,
we were fearless

246
00:44:17,351 --> 00:44:18,351
I was... then.
I have to go

247
00:44:20,749 --> 00:44:22,714
But Joe, what about the baby?

248
00:44:22,749 --> 00:44:24,814
I'll send some money
when I have some

249
00:44:24,849 --> 00:44:26,749
I looked after you
for more than two years

250
00:44:26,799 --> 00:44:28,799
You owe me more...

251
00:44:28,834 --> 00:44:30,799
Bye, Cathie.

252
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:16,299
- Joe, do you want to get on? - No,
I'll see you at the next lock. - All right.

253
00:47:43,299 --> 00:47:44,999
Look at that, Joe

254
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:49,499
Daniel Gordon, plumber
of 26 years old in Glasgow

255
00:47:49,549 --> 00:47:52,899
was in custody charged with
murder of Catherine Dimly,

256
00:47:52,934 --> 00:47:54,249
A future actress

257
00:47:54,299 --> 00:47:56,749
Dimly's body was
discovered 2 weeks ago

258
00:47:56,799 --> 00:47:59,849
by two bargemen where they
recovered it from the River Clay

259
00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:02,699
They'll hang that men for sure

260
00:48:04,149 --> 00:48:06,599
Well, we're going to celebrate

261
00:48:06,649 --> 00:48:09,949
Not every day I'm
mentioned in the papers

262
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:26,999
Here, Joe.

263
00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:10,849
- Joe, I'm going for a beer. Do you want to come?
- No, I'll finish this

264
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:12,699
Serve yourself

265
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:15,449
- I see you later
- See you later, Les

266
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:43,849
Ella. Les will be
back in a minute

267
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,049
He's always late

268
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:55,349
You scared now?

269
00:50:40,449 --> 00:50:42,649
Do you think he knows?

270
00:50:45,049 --> 00:50:47,249
Of course he does

271
00:51:11,399 --> 00:51:13,799
How long he's been out there?

272
00:51:14,999 --> 00:51:17,349
He must come down and see us

273
00:51:21,149 --> 00:51:22,949
What can we do?

274
00:51:23,899 --> 00:51:26,149
It depends on him really

275
00:51:27,799 --> 00:51:30,349
Why it only depends on him?

276
00:51:31,399 --> 00:51:33,749
There's... anyhow

277
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:36,149
He surveys the boat as
if it prepared judgment

278
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:38,299
It's just his way of
knowing we're there

279
00:51:38,334 --> 00:51:40,149
Yes, he's done that

280
00:51:48,199 --> 00:51:50,649
You're just gonna lie here?

281
00:51:51,249 --> 00:51:54,899
There's no hurry.
I finish my cigarette.

282
00:52:57,949 --> 00:52:59,749
I'm sorry, Les

283
00:53:01,899 --> 00:53:04,149
It just happened

284
00:53:04,999 --> 00:53:07,399
There's nothing
personal against you

285
00:53:10,299 --> 00:53:12,999
I just kick you fucking head

286
00:53:14,899 --> 00:53:18,699
I won't fight you, Les. Hit me if
you think it'll make you feel better

287
00:53:24,949 --> 00:53:27,649
What about my son?

288
00:53:28,649 --> 00:53:32,099
What do you think happens to my
son when you are fucking my wife?

289
00:53:32,134 --> 00:53:34,749
- It wasn't like that
- Like what, Joe?

290
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:38,199
Tell me what it was like

291
00:53:40,699 --> 00:53:42,449
Look, I'll get my stuff

292
00:53:42,649 --> 00:53:46,599
- I leave you to sort it out with Ella.
- This hard fucking barge!

293
00:53:50,249 --> 00:53:52,499
I'll go

294
00:54:03,749 --> 00:54:05,949
So he'll write me a letter?

295
00:54:08,149 --> 00:54:10,299
That's what he said

296
00:54:10,399 --> 00:54:12,399
Do you want a cup of tea?

297
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:15,699
- Right, I'll do this one
- Me too

298
00:54:18,749 --> 00:54:21,199
Look what we said before
to each other, Joe.

299
00:55:59,149 --> 00:56:00,649
Stop!

300
00:56:00,749 --> 00:56:02,549
Stop! I don't like it. Joe

301
00:56:03,349 --> 00:56:05,849
I can't swim.
You know it. Stop!

302
00:56:06,249 --> 00:56:09,399
I'm scared, I'm
scared, bastard

303
00:56:35,649 --> 00:56:38,349
They've set the
date for that man's trial

304
00:56:53,649 --> 00:56:56,149
FATHER OF TWO TO STAND TRIAL

305
00:56:57,399 --> 00:56:59,199
I thought 4 he has

306
00:56:59,299 --> 00:57:02,799
- What?
- Children. 4 kids

307
00:57:03,249 --> 00:57:05,399
Yes, so did I. It
must be a mistake

308
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,899
Push out the paper

309
00:57:14,449 --> 00:57:16,099
Poor bastard

310
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:18,614
How? He killed
an innocent woman

311
00:57:18,649 --> 00:57:21,199
You are not the
judge, he didn't do it

312
00:57:21,234 --> 00:57:23,199
What makes you say it?

313
00:57:24,099 --> 00:57:27,199
- It was an accident
- Not what they think

314
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,099
She died without her clothes
so it must be a murder?

315
00:57:30,449 --> 00:57:33,849
Do you want to know how
I know it was an accident?

316
00:57:33,899 --> 00:57:35,949
I thought you were not
interested in all that

317
00:57:39,449 --> 00:57:41,099
I know

318
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:18,499
I came for my stuff

319
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:19,949
I'll get it

320
00:59:30,649 --> 00:59:33,149
- How is Jim?
- You know how he is

321
00:59:33,399 --> 00:59:35,299
Go and see him yourself

322
00:59:36,399 --> 00:59:40,299
I thought he was coming
Stay with me for a while

323
00:59:51,349 --> 00:59:54,049
- You want a cup of tea?
- You've got work to do

324
01:00:01,049 --> 01:00:03,599
They asked me as a
witness at the trial

325
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:06,049
One of us is enough

326
01:00:06,749 --> 01:00:09,799
I cannot tell
them anymore anyway

327
01:00:12,999 --> 01:00:16,649
- You'll say hello to the boy for me?
- Go and see him

328
01:00:34,499 --> 01:00:36,299
We need to find a lawyer

329
01:00:37,499 --> 01:00:39,949
To make things proper again

330
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:56,149
Les said we have no future

331
01:00:56,749 --> 01:00:58,949
He said once the
ration fuel stops

332
01:00:58,984 --> 01:01:01,399
The truck will take over

333
01:01:02,049 --> 01:01:03,849
But that doesn't bother me

334
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:05,999
I've spent my
life on the barges

335
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:12,699
When we save enough
money, if you wish

336
01:01:12,749 --> 01:01:15,799
There is a nice bungalow at
the quiet side of Edinburgh

337
01:01:16,349 --> 01:01:18,049
Wouldn't take
long, would it, Joe?

338
01:01:19,649 --> 01:01:21,899
- What?
- The divorce

339
01:01:24,249 --> 01:01:26,949
I don't know, Ella I don't
know about such things

340
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:32,149
It will be easier when
Jim's bigger, the three of us

341
01:01:41,249 --> 01:01:42,314
Say hello to Joe

342
01:01:42,349 --> 01:01:44,349
- All right
- Bastard!

343
01:01:44,749 --> 01:01:47,099
Mind you langue!

344
01:02:14,499 --> 01:02:17,449
Your wage. Tax deducted

345
01:02:45,399 --> 01:02:46,749
Board!

346
01:02:52,999 --> 01:02:54,449
Some more

347
01:02:58,999 --> 01:03:00,099
Stay ahead

348
01:03:42,249 --> 01:03:45,499
- What's matter?
- It's Sam, my sister's husband

349
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:51,099
There has been un accident.
He felt out the lorry, he was killed

350
01:03:53,549 --> 01:03:56,649
It's about a week,
I just got a letter

351
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,949
I sent her a telegram
saying we'll visit her

352
01:04:16,999 --> 01:04:19,249
I see you have a new boyfriend

353
01:04:19,749 --> 01:04:23,399
This is Joe. We're
going to be married

354
01:04:23,449 --> 01:04:27,099
You have to excuse me not being
dressed I was not expecting visitors

355
01:04:27,192 --> 01:04:29,057
Hello, auntie Gwen.

356
01:04:36,949 --> 01:04:39,449
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- I'll help you

357
01:04:39,999 --> 01:04:41,149
Come on, Jim.

358
01:05:26,749 --> 01:05:29,399
Gwen will come to
barge for a week or two

359
01:05:29,699 --> 01:05:31,749
Hope you don't mind, Joe?

360
01:05:32,849 --> 01:05:35,799
Don't want to
spoil your honeymoon

361
01:05:39,799 --> 01:05:41,499
That'll be good for her

362
01:05:44,449 --> 01:05:48,649
She doesn't drink. Can't
understand people who don't drink

363
01:05:48,849 --> 01:05:50,924
If I don't drink
in the morning

364
01:05:50,959 --> 01:05:52,999
I'll be drunk the whole day

365
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,299
Gin's my drink

366
01:05:55,749 --> 01:05:58,499
Not gin in lemonade

367
01:05:58,649 --> 01:06:00,199
Just gin straight

368
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:03,199
Some people find it
a bit odd but not me

369
01:06:05,749 --> 01:06:08,249
We should get a drink sometimes

370
01:06:08,499 --> 01:06:09,849
Tonight?

371
01:06:10,849 --> 01:06:13,349
We can tell Ella
we go to the cinema

372
01:06:16,049 --> 01:06:19,699
There's one thing I hate
that's going to the dentists

373
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,849
You sure you don't mind, Ella?

374
01:06:22,949 --> 01:06:25,699
- I want to go to the picture
- No, you go

375
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:28,749
Someone has to stay
and look after the barge

376
01:06:30,049 --> 01:06:31,899
You enjoy yourself

377
01:06:34,499 --> 01:06:36,199
See you later, Ella

378
01:06:43,849 --> 01:06:46,299
Of course I'm sorry for Sam

379
01:06:46,334 --> 01:06:48,749
One did not want it to happen

380
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:51,114
I didn't have time
to think a lot though

381
01:06:51,149 --> 01:06:54,399
We had to bury him as soon as possible
when the bus killed him

382
01:06:54,849 --> 01:06:57,749
I thought he
fell off the lorry

383
01:06:57,799 --> 01:06:59,699
Yes he did. Then
the bus ran him over

384
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:12,599
It's about time Ella will look
after ourselves how she is doing

385
01:07:27,949 --> 01:07:30,099
One of your girlfriends?

386
01:07:31,049 --> 01:07:33,999
- Yes, she died
- You still carry her photo

387
01:07:35,499 --> 01:07:37,349
Yes, I don't know why

388
01:07:38,399 --> 01:07:41,349
- I should have get rid of it long time ago
- Of course you should

389
01:07:41,649 --> 01:07:44,149
The dead can't
look after themselves

390
01:07:48,949 --> 01:07:52,749
Drink your cup, we have
business to attend to

391
01:08:18,349 --> 01:08:20,999
Look at the mess
you've made me

392
01:08:45,699 --> 01:08:47,849
Right, that's me

393
01:08:49,099 --> 01:08:51,349
See you love birds
in the morning

394
01:09:37,849 --> 01:09:39,449
Leave me alone, Joe

395
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:00,699
He killed her,
as simple as that

396
01:10:00,734 --> 01:10:02,414
We'll see what
the judge will say

397
01:10:02,449 --> 01:10:05,499
- The law warranty the justice.
- Yes

398
01:10:05,849 --> 01:10:08,599
You want to know what I thing
of this so-called justice?

399
01:10:08,634 --> 01:10:12,599
Lawyers only play words...

400
01:10:12,649 --> 01:10:15,099
This bastard should be hung!

401
01:10:15,249 --> 01:10:17,949
I agree. If this guy is
guilty he has to be hung

402
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:22,899
Calm

403
01:10:39,899 --> 01:10:40,999
Hi there

404
01:10:48,499 --> 01:10:51,699
- I suppose you did any writing today?
- Not much

405
01:10:52,199 --> 01:10:55,399
I know you 're
going to finish it

406
01:10:55,649 --> 01:10:57,149
You think it's easy?

407
01:10:57,249 --> 01:10:59,299
I'm trying to do something
different, don't you understand?

408
01:10:59,349 --> 01:11:01,999
- I'm trying something new
- No, I don't understand

409
01:11:02,449 --> 01:11:06,399
Why can't you write an ordinary book?
What other people can't understand

410
01:11:07,499 --> 01:11:11,349
For 8 months I'm been getting
enough sitting in the lousy office

411
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:13,764
And when I get home
there is a drunker asleep

412
01:11:13,799 --> 01:11:16,699
What have you done today
to earn enough money for us to eat?

413
01:11:16,734 --> 01:11:18,799
- I made some custard
- You did what?

414
01:11:18,849 --> 01:11:20,249
I made some custard

415
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:21,309
Custard?

416
01:11:22,099 --> 01:11:24,549
I worked whole day
and you made some custard

417
01:11:24,584 --> 01:11:27,349
Yes it tricked me a
good idea, so I made some

418
01:11:27,649 --> 01:11:30,149
- It's over here, on the dresser
- Put it where you like

419
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:32,314
Eat it yourself
Taste your custard

420
01:11:32,349 --> 01:11:34,699
I put a lot of effort in this
custard and you're going to eat it

421
01:11:34,949 --> 01:11:37,849
- No, you can't do it
- Oh I know I'm going to do it

422
01:11:41,949 --> 01:11:43,449
You... you are a bastard

423
01:11:43,649 --> 01:11:45,999
You bastard

424
01:13:53,099 --> 01:13:55,699
He should serve enough time

425
01:13:55,799 --> 01:13:58,299
Pervert like that
should be fucked

426
01:13:58,799 --> 01:14:00,399
Hanging, it is too easy

427
01:14:00,949 --> 01:14:03,749
If he is guilty, he should die

428
01:14:03,799 --> 01:14:05,399
That's what they say

429
01:15:27,099 --> 01:15:29,549
- When's your birthday, Joe?
- What?

430
01:15:30,149 --> 01:15:33,199
- It's horoscope, I read it for you
- Where's Ella?

431
01:15:33,299 --> 01:15:35,499
Elle's gone.
Come and sit down

432
01:15:35,549 --> 01:15:37,599
What do you mean
Ella's gone darts?

433
01:15:37,649 --> 01:15:39,549
Elle's gone to see Les.

434
01:15:44,249 --> 01:15:45,749
What you think you're doing?

435
01:15:48,549 --> 01:15:49,749
I'm leaving

436
01:15:50,749 --> 01:15:52,999
Should have done
it long time ago

437
01:16:09,049 --> 01:16:10,999
You are going anywhere?

438
01:16:11,749 --> 01:16:15,099
No, I'm leaving
looking for another job

439
01:16:16,849 --> 01:16:19,199
You're looking for
somewhere to stay?

440
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:20,699
Suppose I am?

441
01:16:21,699 --> 01:16:24,699
- I'll find you a lodger
- I'm not going to stay for long

442
01:16:24,734 --> 01:16:26,099
May be a month

443
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,899
- Well, interested?
- Yes, how much?

444
01:16:30,149 --> 01:16:33,099
10 schillings a week I'll
introduce you to my wife

445
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:38,749
I work at night. You'll
see her more than me

446
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:41,849
You have to pay in advance.

447
01:16:50,899 --> 01:16:53,199
Your room is there

448
01:16:53,449 --> 01:16:55,249
I go to work

449
01:16:56,599 --> 01:16:58,049
I see you in the morning

450
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:02,199
See you later

451
01:17:10,049 --> 01:17:11,099
Daddy!

452
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:36,399
I suppose you 're
our last lodger

453
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:52,699
Get up, he'll be here soon

454
01:18:08,049 --> 01:18:10,999
There were the bargemen who
found her body, isn't it?

455
01:18:13,099 --> 01:18:15,149
- Anyone you know?
- What?

456
01:18:15,299 --> 01:18:18,649
- The bargemen. Did you know them?
- I knew one of them

457
01:18:21,249 --> 01:18:23,199
You have been in a trial?

458
01:18:23,249 --> 01:18:25,399
- No. You?
- No

459
01:18:25,949 --> 01:18:27,849
I don't want to, either

460
01:18:28,649 --> 01:18:30,499
I think I might go along to it

461
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:33,399
Just to see what
it like, you know

462
01:19:04,499 --> 01:19:07,349
Pencils? Give me
small something

463
01:19:14,849 --> 01:19:18,099
How do you describe your
relationship with the deceased?

464
01:19:18,949 --> 01:19:22,849
We were flat mates, but I don't
know I recently moved in so...

465
01:19:23,299 --> 01:19:26,199
we were friendly
rather than friends

466
01:19:26,849 --> 01:19:29,699
And what do you know her
relationship with the accused?

467
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:33,599
I think she met him when he
came to fix plumbing in the flat

468
01:19:33,999 --> 01:19:35,899
I only saw him once, so

469
01:19:36,049 --> 01:19:38,199
couldn't really form an opinion

470
01:19:38,449 --> 01:19:40,999
But I know she was lonely

471
01:19:41,449 --> 01:19:43,949
Her last boyfriend
recently has gone to China

472
01:19:44,449 --> 01:19:46,749
Thank you

473
01:20:01,949 --> 01:20:05,149
You should have been rich Joe,
it might have work then

474
01:20:07,399 --> 01:20:08,849
I loved you

475
01:20:11,549 --> 01:20:13,299
Will you write to me?

476
01:20:15,299 --> 01:20:17,249
I'll send you a
letter from China

477
01:20:20,599 --> 01:20:23,799
- You are not going to China
- May be I am

478
01:20:30,549 --> 01:20:32,249
I'm sorry

479
01:20:37,849 --> 01:20:39,749
What's to be sorry about?

480
01:20:41,299 --> 01:20:42,599
It happens

481
01:20:47,449 --> 01:20:48,799
We ran our course

482
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:08,649
Goodbye, Joe

483
01:21:43,049 --> 01:21:44,599
What you do that for?

484
01:21:45,899 --> 01:21:48,049
I've no use for that

485
01:21:48,799 --> 01:21:52,449
- Must be worth something, no?
- Not to me

486
01:21:54,049 --> 01:21:55,949
I saw him with her

487
01:21:56,499 --> 01:22:00,349
I recognize his face

488
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:03,649
Thank you. No
further questions.

489
01:22:03,749 --> 01:22:07,399
I'd like to call
Mr. Leslie Gold.

490
01:22:19,599 --> 01:22:21,699
Can you please describe
for us the circumstances

491
01:22:21,749 --> 01:22:25,199
under which you found
the body of the deceased?

492
01:22:26,049 --> 01:22:29,249
We were with a cargo
of coal to be delivered

493
01:22:29,349 --> 01:22:31,249
and I saw a body floating by

494
01:22:31,349 --> 01:22:33,799
and I fished it out, with Joe

495
01:22:35,899 --> 01:22:37,049
- Joe?
- My mate

496
01:22:38,899 --> 01:22:40,349
I see

497
01:22:40,849 --> 01:22:42,849
Was Ms. Dimly dead when you...

498
01:22:44,499 --> 01:22:48,549
- fished her out of the water?
- Yes, she was dead already

499
01:22:50,499 --> 01:22:51,599
Thank you

500
01:22:52,899 --> 01:22:54,549
No further questions

501
01:22:55,099 --> 01:22:58,349
We have no further questions

502
01:22:58,899 --> 01:23:01,299
Thank you, you may step down

503
01:23:51,899 --> 01:23:54,349
So? You think he's guilty?

504
01:23:55,849 --> 01:23:59,049
- The murder is not proved yet
- What do you mean?

505
01:23:59,199 --> 01:24:01,349
They didn't prove that it was

506
01:24:01,384 --> 01:24:02,749
They know that

507
01:24:03,149 --> 01:24:05,149
Woman don't get
undressed for nothing

508
01:24:05,184 --> 01:24:08,249
- She had sex
- You'll see

509
01:24:11,049 --> 01:24:12,449
They'll hang him

510
01:24:13,099 --> 01:24:14,399
Poor beggar

511
01:24:15,249 --> 01:24:18,749
According to the examination
of the deceased's shoes

512
01:24:19,249 --> 01:24:22,749
It was found that they matched
exactly those of the accused

513
01:24:22,899 --> 01:24:26,364
Also the fibers found
under her finger nails

514
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:28,849
exactly matched the material
of the accused's shirt

515
01:24:29,549 --> 01:24:31,799
There could be no mistakes

516
01:24:32,549 --> 01:24:36,299
The chances that they could belong
to anyone else are practically nill

517
01:24:36,649 --> 01:24:40,099
With the evidence of sexual
activities and the main of reason

518
01:24:40,949 --> 01:24:45,999
in my opinion there is
overwhelming evidence

519
01:24:46,024 --> 01:24:48,789
that the deceased had intimate
contact with the accused

520
01:24:48,899 --> 01:24:51,299
- very shortly before her death
- Objection

521
01:24:51,449 --> 01:24:53,649
These facts do not have
any relevance for the jury

522
01:24:53,749 --> 01:24:54,999
Overruled

523
01:25:35,299 --> 01:25:37,549
I wasn't with
her then. I swear

524
01:25:37,584 --> 01:25:39,799
I never went near the river

525
01:25:40,049 --> 01:25:41,799
Silence! Silence!
Keep order.

526
01:25:42,949 --> 01:25:45,749
Just answer the
question, Mr. Gordon.

527
01:25:46,299 --> 01:25:47,949
What was the question, sir?

528
01:25:50,999 --> 01:25:53,499
What did you do after removing
the deceased's clothes?

529
01:25:54,299 --> 01:25:55,899
I never took her clothes off

530
01:25:55,999 --> 01:25:58,249
We just went for
a walk together

531
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:01,599
- You was with her
- No, not then

532
01:26:01,899 --> 01:26:02,949
I see

533
01:26:04,249 --> 01:26:06,699
Were you aware that the
deceased was pregnant?

534
01:26:07,622 --> 01:26:08,622
No

535
01:26:10,449 --> 01:26:12,299
No, it wasn't me. No

536
01:26:12,749 --> 01:26:15,499
I didn't. I didn't

537
01:26:15,799 --> 01:26:18,249
- You new she was pregnant?
- No

538
01:26:18,849 --> 01:26:22,599
You planed to get rid of her before
your wife discover your dark secret

539
01:26:22,673 --> 01:26:23,673
No

540
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:27,649
- She invited you to
her house as a tradesman

541
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:31,149
She trusted you
as a tradesman

542
01:26:31,799 --> 01:26:35,849
You abused that position of
trust, you preyed on her loneliness

543
01:26:59,999 --> 01:27:03,199
<i>I alone was with Catherine
Dimly at the time she died</i>

544
01:27:03,499 --> 01:27:05,549
<i>The drowning was accidental</i>

545
01:27:05,949 --> 01:27:07,599
<i>There was no murder</i>

546
01:27:08,149 --> 01:27:11,349
<i>I cannot identify myself without
the risk of finding myself</i>

547
01:27:11,423 --> 01:27:14,773
<i>in the same shoes
as Mr. Gordon.</i>

548
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:17,446
<i>I made a mistake of not
reporting the accident at the time</i>

549
01:27:17,049 --> 01:27:19,299
<i>and I have that
on my conscience</i>

550
01:27:19,799 --> 01:27:22,049
<i>If you condemn Mr. Gordon,</i>

551
01:27:22,449 --> 01:27:24,849
<i>you'll be condemning
an innocent man</i>

552
01:28:40,499 --> 01:28:43,449
Ladies and gentlemen,
who speaks for you?

553
01:28:44,049 --> 01:28:46,149
Have you reached a verdict?

554
01:28:46,749 --> 01:28:47,499
Yes

555
01:28:47,849 --> 01:28:49,449
What is your verdict?

556
01:28:49,549 --> 01:28:52,049
We find the accused
guilty as charged

557
01:28:52,199 --> 01:28:55,099
Is your verdict
unanimous or by majority?

558
01:28:55,499 --> 01:28:56,599
Unanimous

559
01:29:00,199 --> 01:29:02,699
Would the accused please stand

560
01:29:09,249 --> 01:29:12,899
Mr. Gordon, do you have anything to
say before the sentence is passed?

561
01:29:13,149 --> 01:29:16,364
I swear to god I'm innocent

562
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:20,349
- You thought about the child?
- Silence!

563
01:29:20,449 --> 01:29:22,199
Now clear the court

564
01:29:24,449 --> 01:29:27,099
Mr. Daniel Gordon, you
have been found guilty

565
01:29:27,134 --> 01:29:29,499
Of the murder of
Ms. Catherine Dimly.

566
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:32,499
After taking in considerations

567
01:29:32,534 --> 01:29:34,799
all the circumstances
of this case

568
01:29:34,999 --> 01:29:38,399
I have no choice but to impose

569
01:29:38,499 --> 01:29:40,599
the maximum penalty

570
01:29:43,249 --> 01:29:48,199
I therefore sentence you to be hang
by the neck until you are dead

571
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:50,899
May God have
merci on your soul

572
01:29:51,399 --> 01:29:53,049
Take the prisoner out

573
01:30:02,199 --> 01:30:04,149
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury

574
01:30:04,349 --> 01:30:07,599
thank you for your civic duty

575
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:10,049
All rise!
