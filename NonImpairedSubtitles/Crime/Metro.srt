1
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,555
Backtrack is starting to make up ground
and closing on the outside.

2
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,753
They've run past the quarter
pole and Cosy Girl has gone
clear by three lengths.

3
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,110
- Now Backtrack coming out of the pack.
- Come on, Cosy. Come on, Cosy Girl!

4
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,390
Backtrack is gonna be
the danger to Cosy Girl.

5
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,717
They come for home.
Cosy Girl is clear by two.

6
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,956
- One-one-four to Roper.
- But Backtrack is putting in...
- Come on. Dig in there, Cosy Girl.

7
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,832
- a determined run on
the left-hand side.
- Dig in! Roper here.

8
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,679
- One-one-four, Roper. Code
two CP, Fourth and Grand.
- ...Cosy Girl.

9
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,678
But Backtrack is catching stride
for stride on the outside.

10
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,472
- Come on, Cosy Girl!
- It's gonna be a run
for the wire together.

11
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,670
- E.T.A. in five. I'm in route.
- Cosy Girl is tenacious.

12
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,439
But Backtrack keeps on
making up ground on her.

13
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,950
Cosy Girl and Backtrack. Gonna
be a tight photo in this one.

14
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,957
- Come on, Cosy, baby!
- Cosy Girl at the rail.

15
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,072
- Where's the wire?
- Backtrack on the outside.
Here's the wire!

16
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,237
- Come on, Cosy. Come on.
Come on, Cosy Girl. Cosy Girl.
- It's so close between those two.

17
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,590
- Cosy Girl! Cosy Girl!
- But Backtrack has won it!

18
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,518
- Cosy Girl, you lazy bitch!
- Backtrack over Cosy Girl.
Backtrack wins.

19
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,870
- Cosy Girl was second.
- You lazy, hag-ass bitch!

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,151
That cosy shit is why we lost
this race. Bein' fuckin' cosy!

21
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,748
You need to get the fire
under your ass!

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,310
- Move in.
- All the way to the end.
- Set up on the door.

23
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,509
Clear. Take positions.

24
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,557
To the right.

25
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,830
- Got this one.
- Right window.

26
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,195
- They want us to go
around the back side.
- Ninety-seven at the inner perimeter.

27
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,232
No, no, communications are down.
He ripped the phone out.

28
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,351
Yeah, yeah, he's here now.
Got it.

29
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,233
- Hey, Scott.
- Hey, Eiko, where's the command post?

30
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,079
It's down here. Hey, Bob,
I need two guys to go to CP.

31
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,589
- Now what's goin' on?
- Suspect came in shortly
after the bank opened.

32
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,154
A botched robbery.
Teller hit the silent alarm.

33
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,670
He's taken 17 hostages, shot one;
the guard. He's still alive.

34
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,597
- So far, he's asked for a--
- Car.

35
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,631
And a plane waiting at the airport,
and if he doesn't get that--

36
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,796
- He'll kill all the hostages
in five minutes.
- Right.

37
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,195
- What's the suspect's name?
- Earl.

38
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,677
Earl. Shit, you'd think on a day
like today, Earl would go
to the park or somethin', right?

39
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,712
Ladies and gentlemen.
What's up, man?

40
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,353
- Scott.
- Hey.

41
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,711
Rope, glad you could make it.
Captain Solis is on his way down.

42
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,956
-You guys got a profile on Earl?
-Yeah.

43
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,200
- This guy's no genius.
- Well, they ain't usually
graduate students.

44
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,108
- SWAT wants to go in.
- What, they ain't killed
nobody yet this week?

45
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,550
Okay, we got a guy who's probably
on drugs. He's got a record of 4-5-9s.

46
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,671
He's been busted
on possession.

47
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,633
Never been busted on a major felony.
What's this guy's demeanour?

48
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,036
Well, he's a little fuckin' agitated.
He ripped the phone out.

49
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,957
I gotta go face to face.

50
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,992
- No, I don't think so.
- Sam, you got a building
full of hostages.

51
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,510
One of 'em is hurt. We don't know how
bad. This nut pulled out the telephone.

52
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,679
The SWAT said he's got a gun
to somebody's head. If SWAT
goes in there, you're gonna
lose one person, possibly two.

53
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,872
You gotta let me go in there
and look around and make sure
everything's all right in there.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,070
- I don't know.
- Sam, look at the guy's rap sheet.

55
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,715
There's no violence on there.
The guy's never offed anybody.

56
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,516
Hey, look. Are you gonna let me go in
there or are we gonna stand around and
talk and let this guy bleed to death?

57
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,876
Can I have a dozen
doughnuts please?

58
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,356
What makes a guy
do somethin' like that?

59
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,471
Gimme a roof and
a rifle any day.

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,673
CP, I see a WMA
in window three...

61
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,598
holding a handgun
to Asian female's head.

62
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,280
Suspect is wearing
a black vest and T-shirt.

63
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,393
I'm gonna kill somebody!
lf they don't gimme my god-damn
car, I'm gonna kill somebody!

64
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,874
- Who the fuck are you, man?
- Hey, how you doin', Earl?

65
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,197
- I'm Scott Roper, the negotiator.
- Get up! Get up! Get up
where I can see you!

66
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,198
Hands up! Get back! Get back!
Stop right there, motherfucker!

67
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,154
Hands up! Hands up!
Get back!

68
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,153
Get back. Step back.
Stop right there, man.

69
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,794
- Stop.
- Okay, Earl. All right? I'm stoppin'.

70
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,434
- All right, turn around.
- I don't carry a weapon, Earl.
I'm a negotiator.

71
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,358
- I have no gun. See?
- Keep your hands up!

72
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,837
- I'm just pattin' down for you.
- Hands up!
- Pattin' down for you.

73
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,679
- All right?
- What's in the hand, man?
What's in the bag?

74
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,030
These are doughnuts, Earl. I know
you've all been in here a while...

75
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,674
so I brought some doughnuts in case
anybody wanted a snack or something.

76
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,791
Drop the fuckin' bag!
Drop the bag!

77
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,150
Okay, no problem. I'm gonna
put the doughnuts down.

78
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,033
-It's just doughnuts, okay, Earl? Relax.
-Kick 'em over.

79
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,038
- Okay.
- Hands up! Goddamn it, let me see you!

80
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,993
Kick it over, man.
Kick it over!

81
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,396
Pick it up. Pick it up!
Pick it up!

82
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,795
Open the bag! Show me
what's in the bag! Open it!

83
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,637
- It's doughnuts, man.
- That's what I said, man.
I told you they were doughnuts.

84
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,035
That's bullshit, man!
You poisoned that shit!

85
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,549
- You put like fuckin'
powdered shit in it, man.
- Earl. No, no.
- You're fuckin' with me!

86
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,399
Earl, look, I'm not playin'
with you. They're just doughnuts.

87
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,559
- Eat it! Eat one.
- Please, eat. Don't even
worry about the doughnuts.

88
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,353
- Eat the doughnut!
- Let 'em eat 'em. See?

89
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,517
- Where's my fuckin' car, man?
- I'm gettin' you your car,
but first things first.

90
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,393
All right, Earl?
We have to do this thing right.

91
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,431
All right? Okay, Earl?

92
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,711
I want you to take that gun and point it
away from-- What's your name, Miss?

93
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,071
- Debbie.
- You point that gun away
from Debbie's head, okay?

94
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,350
Debbie's fuckin' brains are gonna be all
over the floor in five minutes...

95
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,516
- if you don't get my fuckin' car, man!
- No, please!
- No, Earl. Earl.

96
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,349
That's the worst thing you can do.
That's a really bad move if you do that.

97
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,836
Okay? Let's be clear
about something.

98
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,758
If you kill anybody,
I can't help you.

99
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,314
- No, please, God! No!
- All right? I can't help you.

100
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,956
Rules of the game change then. SWAT will
take you out if you kill somebody.

101
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,799
- That's what they gear up for.
- No, please, don't!

102
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,753
They're ready to do you right now.
I want you to see something.

103
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,917
Come here. Just look--
Just look out the window here.

104
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,395
Look across the street.

105
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,715
There's a sniper
in the window.

106
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,673
He's lookin' at you right now
on a scope on his rifle.

107
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,110
The window next to it,
sniper in there too.

108
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,234
- Oh, shit.
- All around the building,
we got SWAT on the roof.

109
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,113
And they been given the word.
You kill anybody--

110
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,437
anybody, they'll
take you out.

111
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,950
And they don't give a shit. They'll take
you out and go right to lunch, okay?

112
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,514
Fuck! Fuck, man! Fu--

113
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,358
- What are my chances, man?
- Not bad.

114
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,233
You know, last month somebody
robbed a bank in Daly City.

115
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,830
They made it all the way
to the freeway. Cops gave him a car.
He got on the freeway and he lost 'em.

116
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,793
- Oh, God!
- Really?
- But they didn't kill anybody.

117
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,480
Hmm? How you doin', Harold?

118
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,592
- Hey, what are you doin' to that, man?
- Okay, uh, Earl?

119
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,589
I gotta take Harold outta here.
He's bleedin' pretty bad.
I took an oath as a negotiator.

120
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,632
If I ever go into a hostile situation
and there's an injured party...

121
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,354
I'm duty bound by that oath
to take the person to safety.

122
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,392
Now, you can shoot me if you
want, but the next negotiator's
gonna tell you the same thing.

123
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,636
- All right?
- Just gimme my car, man,
all right? Gimme my car.

124
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,833
Everybody, everything's gonna
be all right. We're gonna get
everybody out of here. Okay?

125
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,157
- You get me my car or I'll
do her, man! I fuckin' swear,
I'm not fuckin' around!
- We'll get you your car.

126
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,556
All right? And Earl, Earl.
Take that gun down from Debbie's head.

127
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,194
- Don't mess wi--
- We don't wanna have any accidents.
- Don't fuck with me, man.

128
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,835
- Everything's gonna be cool.
- Get me my car, man!

129
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,758
- God, no, don't kill me!
- Shut up!

130
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,270
- Come on!
- Hold your fire!
- Let's go! Let's go!

131
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,755
That's one out.
Seventeen to go.

132
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,519
Okay, Harold, here you go.

133
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,037
- Gimme your gun.
- What?
- Gimme your gun.

134
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,995
- Man, I haven't had to shoot
anybody in three years.
- Why not keep the streak alive?

135
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,477
- 'Cause this strung-out
junkie's gonna kill somebody.
- What the hell are you doing out there?

136
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,431
What's going on?

137
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,312
Okay, Earl, it's happening.
Got your car comin'.

138
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,830
Harold's gone to safety.
Everything is cool. And we're
gonna get everybody out of here.

139
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,350
But first, as a show of good
faith, gimme another hostage.

140
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,869
- Gimme Debbie.
- I gave you the old fuckin' man, man!

141
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,992
He don't count. He was bleedin',
he was gonna die in here and
that would've been on your ass.

142
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,351
I did you a favor takin' him outta here.
Now, gimme a hostage. Gimme Debbie.

143
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,552
- Am I gettin' my car, man?
- You're gonna get your car.
But gimme a hostage.

144
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,671
Come on. Gimme Debbie, man.

145
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,511
Take them, man! Take 'em!
Take em'!

146
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,200
- Okay, you three, let's go.
- Take them! Take them!

147
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,039
Go!

148
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,152
Please don't kill me!
Please don't!

149
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,272
See, we're makin' progress.
We're gonna get everybody
outta here. Everybody, relax.

150
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,709
- I'm gonna get your car right now.
- Gimme my car, man.
- I'll get your car right now.

151
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,035
- Gimme my car, man!
- I'll get your car.

152
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,913
- Oh, there's one other thing.
- What? What?

153
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,996
You want a hardtop
or convertible?

154
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,634
- Fuck, man. A fuckin'
hardtop, man. Hardtop.
- Hardtop.

155
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,274
- Hardtop, man.
- Hardtop. All right.

156
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,155
- Manual or automatic?
- Automatic!

157
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,555
Stay down!
Don't you fuckin' move!

158
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,989
- Don't shoot me!
- Don't you fuckin' move!
- Don't shoot me! I give up, man!

159
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,157
Everybody, down!
On the floor!

160
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,516
- Don't shoot me, man!
- Right now! On the floor!

161
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,111
- On the floor!
- Oh, man, don't shoot me!
Don't shoot! Don't--

162
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,152
- Captain Solis, can we speak
to lnspector Roper?
- Inspector Roper?
- Inspector Roper?

163
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,636
- Inspector Roper?
- Inspector Roper, what happened inside?

164
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,558
Inspector Roper, you've successfully
negotiated nine times in the past.

165
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,114
- What was different
about this situation?
- Please, please, ladies and gentlemen.

166
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,834
The inspector is not available
to answer your questions right now.

167
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,111
- We're just very thankful nobody
got killed in this incident.
- Can't you give us something, Kevin?

168
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,118
Now, the inspector will be available to
answer your questions in two hours...

169
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,196
at the official police briefing
at police headquarters.

170
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,276
Inspector Roper, are you okay?
Are you okay?

171
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,756
- Please, please, we have
no further information.
- Hey.

172
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,797
Now that is one
for the front page.

173
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,390
Now, what are you doin' comin'
down here and torturin' me?
You know I'm in love with you.

174
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,317
- Don't start.
- Don't tell me not to start.

175
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,432
Look, Ronnie, that baseball
player you're runnin' around
with, that guy is bad news.

176
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,233
Oh, really. Let's think about this.
He makes about two million a year.

177
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,069
- A really nice guy, and he worships me.
- I worship you too.

178
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,670
- Scott, you worship your bookie.
- No, forget that. Listen.
What's this guy's name?

179
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,951
- Greg.
- Well, I read that
Greg's knees are blown out.

180
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,640
You know, in ten years, you're gonna be
pushin' him around in a wheelchair.

181
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,877
- A lot of hills in this town.
- You know what I think?

182
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,072
I think you only want me back
'cause you can't have me.

183
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,715
Well, I don't think it matters what you
think. What matters is that I think
we should be together.

184
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,753
Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen to me.
Can we please go out this weekend?

185
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,997
No way. And talking
of going out.

186
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,509
What about Troy? You told me
you'd take him out over a month ago.

187
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,712
Hey, Veronica, I had a really
rough month, you know. I know
I was supposed to get with him.

188
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,072
He misses you. I tell him you're
coming around and his eyes light
up. And then when you don't--

189
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,351
Now why do you wanna lay all this guilt
on me, huh? Look, Saturday.

190
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,311
We'll get together on Saturday,
me, you and Troy.

191
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,874
We'll go to the park. We'll
have the most beautiful day.
One big happy family.

192
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,276
No, no, no. You and Troy.
We spend enough time together.

193
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,994
Troy needs a man
in his life.

194
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,429
And besides, I'm seeing
Greg on Saturday.

195
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,028
What do you mean you're going
out with Greg on Saturday? What--

196
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,675
You-- You're gonna go out
with Greg and I'm supposed
to go out with Troy to the park?

197
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,156
- You know-- You know,
that's a little tacky.
- Tacky?
- Yes, that's tacky.

198
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,840
And it's gonna confuse Troy,
you don't think so?

199
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,112
Look, can I drive you to the
paper so we can talk about this?
Please? Can I drive you?

200
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,515
Huh? Hey!

201
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,998
Hey! Hey! That's my car!

202
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,433
Not any more. Now it belongs
to Silver Hills Financial.

203
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,039
And he was there
the whole time.

204
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,913
- Good work today, Scott.
- Thank you, lnspector.
- If you had gotten them to me
when I needed them--

205
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,316
- I needed them two days ago.
- How're we doin' for the night?

206
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,954
- Two on the floor.
- You're my hero.

207
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,197
- Dinner's on you.
- You got yourself a deal.
I gotta meet with Solis.
- Okay, go get him.

208
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,436
Later on.

209
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,672
Absolutely. Yes, sir, I agree
with you a hundred percent.

210
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,032
Yeah, he just walked in to my
office. Chief says, "Good job
this morning. Congratulations."

211
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,550
- Oh, well tell him
to give me a raise then.
- He said, "Thank you very much, Chief."

212
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,318
- That's not what I said.
- Yes, sir.

213
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,795
Yes, sir, I'll discuss it
with him right now.

214
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,957
Got ya. Goodbye, Chief.

215
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,799
- Roper.
- What?

216
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,630
It has been decided that you will take
on a new partner and train him to be
able to take over for you.

217
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,638
Is that why you got this guy
in the Sunday school outfit
sitting out here in the lobby ?

218
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,228
- His name is Kevin McCall.
- Oh, Captain.

219
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,399
Every metro captain agrees
he's their best sharpshooter
and the most likely to succeed.

220
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,277
This is bullshit, Captain.

221
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,000
He tested high on his intellectual
aptitude, didn't he?

222
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,554
- Not as high as me, but pretty high.
- That's true.

223
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,752
National Marksman's Finalist,
attended NYC, went to college.

224
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,110
Very impressive.
FBI sniper school.

225
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,629
Mayoral commendation.
Additional skills:

226
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,751
biathlete, marathoner,
lip-reading.

227
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,713
This is great. Why don't you
send this guy to the Marines?
He's not a negotiator.

228
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,037
- He'll quit in two weeks, Captain.
- You let me worry about that.

229
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,674
Well, I hope there's gonna be
some kind of expression
of y'all's appreciation...

230
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,439
if I gotta hang out
with Huck Finn over there.

231
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,916
What, uh-- what kind of appreciation
did you have in mind?

232
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,998
Honestly?

233
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,509
Five thousand dollars.

234
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,471
- Okay, I can do that.
- And a car.

235
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,831
I'm not giving you a god-damned car.
I just gave you a $5,000 raise.

236
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,076
- Get your own damn car.
- Come on, Captain.
I've been down to impound.

237
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,998
I saw what you got there.
You got a beautiful black Benz
just sittin' there right now.

238
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,076
- Nobody's doin' nothin'.
- Impound is not a rent-a-car company.

239
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,316
The car's part of the deal.
I don't have a car.

240
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,352
- What the hell happened
to your Trans Am?
- They repoed my shit this morning.

241
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,040
Look, I'm not promising you nothing,
but I'll see what I can do.

242
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,991
Look, do what you can.

243
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,237
Oh, and I get to keep all the
money, even if this guy quits
'cause SWAT guys don't have...

244
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,079
the temperament or the background
for what I do, okay, Captain?

245
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,112
You know what I'm sayin'?
Hey, how you doin', man? I heard
tremendous things about you.

246
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,390
- Yeah, I'm lookin' forward
to working with you too.
- Yeah, you'll be good.

247
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,431
You've got a lot of hard work in front
of you if you're gonna be a negotiator.

248
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,596
I'm up to it. And don't worry,
I'll be around longer than two weeks.

249
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,712
So, don't, don't worry
about that, okay?

250
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,078
Hey, man, don't be readin' my lips and
shit. You save that for when you're at
sniper school, all right?

251
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,953
Okay, well, don't worry about what I'm
gonna do for the next few weeks, okay?

252
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,877
- Gentlemen, can we move past this?
- We got past it.

253
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,956
- We're just getting
acquainted with each other.
- I'm fine.

254
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,038
Well, I think that's very nice.
Now, if you both excuse me,
I do have other work to do.

255
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,276
- Oh, my bad. We're gone.
- Thank you, Captain.

256
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,710
- Roper?
- Sir?
- About the transportation issue.

257
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,470
- See the impound sergeant.
- Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

258
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,558
- So, you ever been
in a hostage situation?
- Only at the very end.

259
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,672
- Yeah, what did you feel
like after the shooting?
- Like it had to be done.

260
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,758
- It very rarely has to be done.
- And I've very rarely shot anyone.

261
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,395
- Yeah, well, SWAT is a
lifesaving unit. Remember that.
- Now I know that, okay?

262
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,671
- You know, you know a lot.
You're a wiseass.
- No, excuse me?
- You heard what I said.

263
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,032
You're a wiseass.
And I got a special little test
for first-day wiseasses here.

264
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,152
Here. Look. I want you to get
this cap out of the bottle...

265
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,271
without touching,
without destroying the bottle.

266
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,709
- Okay, don't move it.
- And what's the point?

267
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,637
It's a little test
in lateral thinking.

268
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,479
The obvious solution isn't always
the only solution. You got options.

269
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,275
- Use your head. Use your mind.
Don't break the bottle.
- Okay.

270
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,197
- Have a nice day.
- Okay.

271
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,676
No touching!

272
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,359
Hey, don't look at me.
I went to public school.

273
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,950
Right. Great.
Thank you.

274
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,232
Mind if we make a stop on the way?
We busted Frank Antonucci on possession.

275
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,432
- He gave us a lead on the
Polk Street jewellery heist.
- Phony Frank?

276
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,916
Don't waste your time. That guy'd finger
his firstborn to dodge a collar.

277
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,237
I still got to do it.
Wasting time is half my job.

278
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,478
- Yeah, all right.
- You know, I think that SWAT
guy might be a good idea.

279
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,068
May take a little pressure off you.
I'm beginning to worry about you.

280
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,272
Where is 72-- You worrying about me?
What are you worryin' about me for?

281
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,109
I saw you talkin' to Ronnie
this morning. I don't know why
you can't get it back together.

282
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,913
I mean, you got to be out of your mind
not to get with that one.

283
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,474
What are you talking about?
It's not me. It's her.

284
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,194
She's goin' out with some baseball
player named Greg Barnett.

285
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,753
- No kiddin'?
- Mm.

286
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,190
Get out of here.
That boy can hit and run.

287
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,192
And throw!

288
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,758
Why don't you just get some
pom-poms and start chanting,
"Greg, Greg, Greg." Fuck him!

289
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,838
What is wrong
with this car door?

290
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,556
- Come on, man.
- Give me the keys.

291
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,150
There's no alarm on those.
Hey, y'all got a spare key...

292
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,034
so I can get to this kill switch
in here and turn this shit off?

293
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,359
This shit is bad. You hear me,
Sam? This is some bad shit.

294
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,948
- Rope, this is it.
- This is too fly.

295
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,197
- This is it.
- What?

296
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,276
This is it.
This is your ride.

297
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,758
No, that's not my ride. This is my ride
over here. This black car's my ride.

298
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,395
No, no, no. The black one is mine.
That's the one I'm-- This is my ride.

299
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,273
- Not that shit.
- This is your ride.

300
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,995
Oh, come on, now. Who am l, Redd Foxx?
I can't roll in no shit like that.

301
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,918
Man, what's up, Sam?

302
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:19,068
That shit's not funny, Sam. I gotta
roll around in this shit all week.

303
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,113
- Man, where's your stereo?
- Never mind the stereo.
What's that smell?

304
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,196
Oh, man, just get in. Come on.
We ain't got all day.

305
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,312
Man, this truck smells
like fish.

306
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,838
Fish and shit.

307
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,520
- Apartment 304.
- You want me to come up with you?

308
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,552
Nah, it probably won't turn up anything.
I'm just gonna talk to him.

309
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,557
Good, 'cause I don't
wanna be late.

310
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,468
- Hey, you want anything on the game?
- What's the line?

311
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,195
- Warriors plus six.
- I'll take half your action.

312
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,117
Very, very smart man.

313
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,470
Hurry up, man.

314
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,673
- Who is it?
- Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the
San Francisco Police Department.

315
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,757
- Everything all right?
- May I come in?

316
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,431
- I would just like to ask you
a couple of questions.
- Absolutely. Come on in.

317
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,516
Thank you.

318
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,992
Nice.

319
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,759
- Very nice.
- Thanks.

320
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,869
- Count Basie?
- Ellington.

321
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,154
"Things Ain't What They Used to Be."
It was recorded July 30, 1945.

322
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,637
Yeah, yeah. Now I can hear it. Where did
you find an old recording like that?

323
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,515
There's a used record shop down
on Turk Street called Memory Lane.

324
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,949
Actually, I went in there looking
for a rare Robert Johnson.

325
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,753
- Yeah, I think I know the place.
I'll have to get in there.
- You should.

326
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,589
Uh, Mr Korda, do you know
a Frank Antonucci?

327
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,598
Guy who owns the bakery
down the street?

328
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,429
No, this is a different Frank.
This is a man who deals in jewellery.

329
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,154
Stolen, usually. You wouldn't
know anybody like that?

330
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,114
No, I certainly would not.

331
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,153
- Is it--
- No, it's just a little something here.

332
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,953
Could I have
a little water, please?

333
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,913
Sure.

334
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,917
Thank you.

335
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,074
The reason I'm asking
you is because...

336
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,636
we arrested him
with some stolen jewellery.

337
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,914
We traced it back to a robbery
of a store down on Polk Street.

338
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,998
He said he was
fencing it for you.

339
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,830
Obviously, there's been
some mistake.

340
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,077
Look, I gotta level
with you.

341
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,953
I got this cousin.
Here you go.

342
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,594
He's had a lot of run-ins
with the law.

343
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,553
I wouldn't be surprised if he's trying
to entangle me in this situation.

344
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,229
- It wouldn't be the first time.
- This cousin of yours, what's his name?

345
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,115
Clarence Teal. Believe me,
they'll know who I'm talkin' about.

346
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,438
- Your cough seems better.
- Oh, yes.

347
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,917
Two hundred bucks. I'll take
the points. Yeah, okay.

348
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,873
Hello, Judge Stone? This is
Lieutenant Samuel Baffert.

349
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,436
I'm at a suspect's residence. I'm
requesting a telephonic search warrant.

350
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,949
There's visible evidence on
the premises, glassine envelopes
with jeweller's markings.

351
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,517
That is correct,
Judge Stone.

352
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,438
I believe a full search
of the premises will turn up--

353
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,351
Jesus! Sam! Sam!

354
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,989
Call an ambulance!
Now! Now!

355
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,400
Oh, my God!

356
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,034
- Clear for rescue.
- I'm a cop.

357
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,512
Move!

358
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,755
Yes, sir, all of our forces will be
brought to bear. We will get this guy.

359
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,678
Yeah, he's here.
I'll tell him.

360
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,594
The chief wants you
to know how sorry he is.

361
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,431
He said he was just going up
to talk to the guy.

362
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,196
He said--

363
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,355
- I wanna be put on this case.
- I can't do that.

364
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,268
- No, I want to be put on this case.
- You know damn well
I cannot assign you to this.

365
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,709
You're much too close to it.
You're too close to Sam.

366
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,956
- You let the department handle it.
- Who's runnin' it?

367
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,196
- Roper!
- Who's runnin' it?

368
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,030
Kimura and Glass
will head the investigation.

369
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,038
Scott. Go home.

370
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,792
- Okay, check on it.
- Tell me what you've got
on the son of a bitch.

371
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,038
Let me get back to you. Solis
said to keep you out of this.

372
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,276
I don't give a shit
what Solis said!

373
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,473
Anybody get any information on this
fucking Korda, you tell me about it!

374
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,596
Just a minute.

375
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,272
- Hey.
- Hey yourself. I came to see Troy.

376
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,595
It's a little late for
that, Scott. He's asleep.

377
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,711
Oh, shit.

378
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,118
- Jack Daniels?
- Yes, I spent some time
with Jack tonight.

379
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,196
But I'm not drunk yet.

380
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,915
Maybe you should be.

381
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,069
You heard about
what happened?

382
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,760
Yeah. I'm sorry.

383
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,873
Can I come in
for a minute?

384
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,635
Is that a new picture?

385
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,594
It's about four months old.
I've been working on a different style.

386
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,116
Hey, Troy.
How ya doin'?

387
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,671
How ya doin'? Did you miss me,
huh? Did you miss me?

388
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,075
Huh, Troy? Did you miss me?
Did you?

389
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,794
No kissing though.
No kissing.

390
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,151
You know I don't do
that kissing thing, right?

391
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,150
I'm not gonna take up
too much of your time. I just
need somebody I can talk to.

392
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,318
Must be pretty awful.
You don't usually talk
to someone when you're hurting.

393
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,955
It was my fault.
I was right downstairs.

394
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,470
All I had to do was just go
up with him. I was right there.

395
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,388
Scott, y-you
can't save everyone.

396
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,952
Yeah, well, I definitely proved
that tonight for sure.

397
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,751
Look, uh, I don't even know
why I came up here.

398
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,908
This was a...
total waste of my time.

399
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,474
Where'd I put my keys?
Where'd I put my keys?

400
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,636
Scott, what do you
want from me?

401
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,557
Obviously something
I can't have any more!

402
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,274
Don't you dare
try to make me feel guilty.

403
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,676
The whole time we were together,
you went out of your way
to prove you didn't need me.

404
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:54,112
And now suddenly, for one night, you
need me again? Well, I can't do that.

405
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,437
I can't be more than just your friend
because I know exactly what'll happen.

406
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,438
A few weeks from now,
and you'll be back on top...

407
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,028
and you'll shut me out just as soon as
you don't need me again.

408
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,799
Is that what you think?
You think I didn't need you?

409
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,593
That's what you think?

410
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,678
Well, if you did,
you never showed it.

411
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,950
Oh, Ronnie.

412
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,753
Look, listen to me.

413
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,792
Listen. Look at me.
Look at me.

414
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,117
In my whole life--
I never in my whole--

415
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,198
You expecting somebody?

416
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,553
This night is just getting
better and better.

417
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,909
Where are my fuckin' keys at?
Where are my keys?

418
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,476
They're here on the table
where you always leave them.

419
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,514
Hey, baby, I thought you--

420
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,596
Hey. Greg Barnett.

421
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,310
Excuse me.

422
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,833
- Hey, Mike.
- If you weren't family
I'd fucking kill you.

423
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,988
- Mikey! Mikey!
- You told Antonucci
you got that shit from me?

424
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,714
Don't say shit!

425
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,751
- Huh?
- I'm sorry, Mike.
- Sorry about what?

426
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,998
He's got respect for you, Mike.
He was gonna try and lowball me.

427
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,352
Yeah, and what the fuck do
I use you for, Clarence? To be
a walkin' fuckin' advertisement?

428
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,199
- I'm sorry, Mike.
- You're sorry?

429
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,233
Antonucci never flipped on
anybody before, man. He said
he had the cops paid off.

430
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,477
Not the cop
that showed up at my door!

431
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,190
What happened, Mike?

432
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,637
Mike.
I'm sorry, Mike.

433
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,076
Two days, I could've taken that fuckin'
store. Now I can't even show my face.

434
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,914
I got a couple thousand bucks,
Mike, if you need to leave town.

435
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,237
Fuckin' leave town? They're gonna
know me in Des Moines by now.

436
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,638
Ten million dollars, Clarence!
Ten million fuckin' dollars!

437
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,798
I could've disappeared.
I could've had it made!

438
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,115
That's all right, Clarence.

439
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,711
I'll just stick around and take care of
you for the rest of my fuckin' life.

440
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,033
Did you k-kill him, Mike?

441
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,395
Oh, God.
I'm sorry, Mike.

442
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,637
I'm sorry, Mike-- Mike--

443
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,594
I didn't know, Mike.
I fucked up, Mike.

444
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,031
I fucked up now.
Oh, fuck. I'm fucked up.

445
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,277
- Come on.
- I didn't know.

446
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,551
- I didn't know, Mike. I messed up.
- Come here. It's all right.

447
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,478
- I messed up.
- It's all right.

448
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:52,197
- I messed everything up.
- It's all right.
I didn't mean what I said.

449
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,914
I'm sorry.

450
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,237
It's not your fault
you're stupid.

451
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,675
Eiko! What you got on Korda?

452
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,349
We ran a search on relatives.
He's got a cousin in town,
Clarence Teal, small-time thief.

453
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,311
Last known address
was on Pine Street.

454
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,317
He moved a month ago. We've got
a couple of leads to check.

455
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,432
- Did you check with DMV
about vehicle registration?
- It's being faxed over now.

456
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,120
How about the record room
for any incident reports?
This guy could've been a victim.

457
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,232
We could get medical records. Have
somebody check with burglary detail.

458
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,794
- See if they know him and if--
- Look, Roper, we've--
- Forensics on two.

459
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,514
And bars. Check with his
neighbours and find out the kind
of bars he used to frequent.

460
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,074
- Scott, we're into it.
- I'm into this shit.
- Roper!

461
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,876
We've already had this conversation.
You are not active on this case.

462
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,951
It's in everyone's
best interest.

463
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,999
Well, y'all are doing
good work here. I'm--

464
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,678
Sorry about your friend. I lost
somebody in SWAT. I know it's rough.

465
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,113
I appreciate your concern,
but let's just leave it at that.
What's this you're reading?

466
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,630
Strategies and Countermeasures
in Hostage Situations.

467
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,473
- You're not having too much progress
with this thing either.
- Oh, wait, no.

468
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,148
You really had me stumped.

469
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:37,279
Very impressive. You get an "A."
See, no force was required.
No damage was done. All right?

470
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,598
That was your partner?

471
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,312
Yeah.

472
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,633
Why'd he do that?

473
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,594
Well, he figured the kid had a
zero percent chance of survival.

474
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,234
I guess he thought
his odds were better.

475
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,193
We had a plan, then SWAT
opened up fire too early...

476
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,357
and a perp
took out my partner.

477
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,869
You remember this.

478
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,436
You always use your eyes
to keep that connection.
That's the most important thing.

479
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,791
- It's like hypnosis.
- Right.

480
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,878
You connect with them.
You're always on their side.

481
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,397
Okay.

482
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,511
How much money
you got on you?

483
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,949
- What's that?
- How much money you got?

484
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,277
- I don't know, like 100 bucks. Why?
- Come on.

485
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,279
Ladies and gentlemen, a reminder
it is now ten minutes to post.

486
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,188
- We have exacta--
- You know why I like coming
to the track?

487
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,390
Yeah. You're
a compulsive gambler.

488
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,795
No. The multitude
of possibilities.

489
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,798
Everything is here for you to see if you
just know what conditions to look for.

490
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,480
Just like a hostage situation.
Now, you see the four horse?

491
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,875
- Mm-hmm.
- Droppin' in class, no works...

492
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,036
front wraps,
lookin' all broken down.

493
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,549
- You wouldn't bet on him, right?
- Right.
- Wrong. You bet on him.

494
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,752
'Cause see the woman right
there with the big belt buckle.
That's the owner of the horse.

495
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,235
- And that belt buckle is
a championship belt buckle.
- I do too.

496
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,477
She wouldn't come out here with
a fancy buckle on unless the
horse was live. We go with him.

497
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,875
- That's how you pick your bets?
By belt buckles?
- That's true. Well, just trust me now.

498
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,594
- That's good.
- Now, you see the horse next
to that? That's the favourite
over there with his tail up.

499
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,632
Lookin' all washy, foamin'
in the mouth, lookin' all rank and shit.

500
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,591
- Uh-huh.
- Supposed to be the favourite, but he
don't even feel like runnin' today.

501
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,359
- We don't go with him.
He's-He's out. Not at all.
- Okay.

502
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,031
Now, the six horse.
The six horse looks great. Got
a shiny coat, that bouncy walk.

503
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,438
That horse is live.
And that trainee/jockey combo?
You can't lose on that.

504
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,075
- What do you think?
- I got two words for you: seek help.

505
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,919
Oh, and I have three words
for you: exacta.

506
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,350
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. Come on.

507
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,596
- And away they go!
- Come on!

508
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,676
- With lndia Lucky on the outside.
- Come on!

509
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,399
Okay, we're in good shape.
We're in good shape.

510
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,392
- The six horse is last.
- Don't worry about that.
That's his style.

511
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,193
- What? To run last?
- To run late.

512
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,993
- They come now in full speed.
Pretty Prince on the outside.
- See?

513
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,032
The favorite's fading and the four horse
is in the lead, just like I said.

514
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,038
- Our guy is still last.
- Don't worry about that. He'll
be runnin' at the quarter pole.

515
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,709
Come on, six horse!
Come on, Russell!

516
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,638
- We need first and second?
- First and second. Come on, Russell!

517
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,832
- Who's Russell?
- The jockey. Come on, Russell!

518
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,235
- Come on, Russell!
- How much do we win?

519
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,669
- Eight hundred dollars.
Come on, Russell.
- We win $800?

520
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,189
- Eight hundred dollars.
- Come on, Russell.
- Come on, Russell!

521
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,788
- Come on, Russell.
- Russell!
- Get that 800, Russell!

522
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,798
- Come on, Russell!
- Come on, Russell!
- Come on, Russell!
- Come on, Russell!

523
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,434
- Let's go, Russell!
- Come on, Russell!
- Russell!
- Come on, Russell!

524
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,916
- Way to go, Russell! Come on!
- Come on, Russell!
- Go, go, Russ!
- Russell! Russell!

525
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,632
- Come on, Russell!
- Go, Russ!

526
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,910
- We won! We won!
- Oh, shit! We lost!

527
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,759
- We won!
- We lost!
- We won!
- You wanna bet?

528
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,395
- You wanna bet on whether we
just won? What, are you crazy?
- Russell, you midget fuck!

529
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,034
- He won!
- You little midget--

530
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,833
- He won!
- Hey, we won!
- He won!
- Yea!

531
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,791
- Way to go, Russell!
Way to go, Russell!
- Hey, Russell!

532
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,516
-Sorry about that, Russell.
-Don't worry about him, Russell.
-Hey, Russell, it's cool.

533
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,074
- Twelve dollars on the
next race on number eight.
- How long you been comin' here?

534
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,192
About six years. My old partner
turned me on to this place.

535
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,359
- Is it always like this?
- Well, occasionally you lose,
but today we are winners.

536
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,835
- That's right.
- Pay the winners, please.

537
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,076
Oh, Benjamin.

538
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,158
Benjamin looks so sad. I'm in
such a wonderful mood, Benjamin.

539
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,350
Here you go.
There's your share.

540
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,755
- Wait, wait. That's only three.
- What?

541
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,713
Oh, you got good eyes.

542
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,231
- That's part of your training.
I was making sure you can--
- That's right.

543
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,157
Hello.

544
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,117
Okay. I'm on my way.
Let's go.

545
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,797
Gonna need another
R.A. unit!

546
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,955
- What's the 10-20 on the incident?
- Shreve, right on the corner.

547
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,039
- Man, this looks like a shit sandwich.
- Yeah.

548
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,869
You see this car? I'm riding
around in a shitmobile...

549
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,434
and Solis got this out
of impound for 14 grand.

550
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,518
- It's worth at least 30.
- Yeah, police corruption's everywhere.

551
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,631
Bastard.

552
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,557
Where's Solis?

553
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,559
Right. Okay. You relax.
Joe-- Joe--

554
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,148
Thirty-two minutes ago, the silent alarm
went off, then the fire alarm.

555
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,113
There was a unit about a block away.
The suspect got trapped inside.

556
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,710
- You got any verification
on numbers?
- So far, we've only seen
and talked to one suspect.

557
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,674
He calls himself Joe. Now there's no
confirmation, but there could be more.

558
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,075
An employee escaped
through the rear door.

559
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,873
As far as we can ascertain, there's
two jewellers, two salespeople...

560
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,117
a manager, security guard, elderly
woman; we believe one other female.

561
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,392
Now listen, this particular
store is where they do a lot
of jewellery making and repair.

562
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,512
On any given day, they can have between
eight and ten million in raw stones.

563
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,279
So they sure shit didn't just wander in.
They knew what they were lookin' for.

564
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,472
- What have you promised them?
- Just that I'd talk to my superiors.

565
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,832
- You locate any good
points of entrance?
- The place is designed to be a vault.

566
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,076
Let me know
when you got a visual.

567
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,309
Okay.
Tape's rolling.

568
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,434
- Yeah.
- Hello, Joe. I'm lnspector Roper.

569
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,755
- How you people doin' in there?
- Good.

570
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,316
Solis is off the job now.
I'm the guy who's authorized to
give you everything you want.

571
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,590
First, I gotta come down there
and talk to you.

572
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,518
- No, you don't.
- Uh, yes, I do, Joe.
I have to come down there...

573
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,676
and I have to talk to you
to make sure that there are
no misunderstandings...

574
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,715
and make sure nobody is hurt in there
before we can take care of business.

575
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,717
All right, Roper.
You wanna come? Come.

576
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,879
Listen, Joe. I'm not armed,
okay? We gotta operate
on trust here. I'm not armed.

577
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,834
I'm gonna come down there and
I'm gonna talk to you and get you guys
out of there as soon as possible.

578
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,110
Five minutes.

579
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,913
This is obviously the part
of the job that sucks.

580
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,670
- We got a standby on call.
- You got it?

581
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,038
Hey, hey, hey.

582
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,838
How can he be sure
the guy won't shoot him?

583
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,520
He can't.

584
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,197
Right there.

585
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,117
- Can I put my hands down?
- Where I can see 'em.

586
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,710
You're Roper, and you're
in charge, right?

587
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,197
- Yep.
- Good. You listen up.
I say this one time.

588
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,596
I want a four-wheel drive vehicle.
New, perfect condition.

589
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,393
I want a uniformed cop.
Drive it up right here.
You leave the engine running.

590
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,956
He walks to the end of the
block. Then we'll come out.

591
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,152
I know all the tricks, so no
remote control devices, okay?

592
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,510
When I say perfect condition,
I mean, if it's low in wiper fluid...

593
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,710
someone gets shot,
and we'll start again.

594
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:06,072
I want a plane waitin' at the airport.
I'll tell him where I'm goin'
when I get there.

595
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,272
- Is that all?
- For now, that's all.

596
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,711
Okay, Joe, you're gonna get
all those things, but first
you gotta do something for me.

597
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,798
I want you to let me come inside
and take a look around and make
sure everybody's all right.

598
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,354
- You just do shit for me right now.
- Wait a minute, Joe.

599
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,278
I'm doin' a lot for you, okay?
You gotta do somethin' for me.

600
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,154
You gotta show an act of good faith.
Let me have one hostage.

601
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,909
I'll give you somethin'. Here.

602
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,629
In 15 minutes, it'll be a bigger
piece. We understand each other?

603
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,035
- Yeah, we understand each other.
- Good.

604
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,549
No, no, no, please!

605
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,399
No, sir, not to the best
of my knowledge.

606
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,317
- That's correct.
- Yes, sir.

607
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,558
That's right. He's here right
now. Let me get back to you.

608
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,715
We're gonna have to take
this guy out.

609
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,400
Well, can't we
wear him down?

610
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,758
Now, I believe there's at least
one fatality in there already.

611
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,075
I think it was gunfire
that set the fire alarm off.

612
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,998
I think this guy is working
by himself 'cause the whole time
I was talkin' to him...

613
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,793
he had a hostage and he had a gun to her
head, and he wouldn't leave the doorway.

614
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,673
He's got a real calm and creepy
demeanour. The guy's a fucking wacko.

615
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,271
The scariest thing about him
is he indicated familiarity
with our techniques.

616
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,153
- So what do you want to do? You
wanna go in there and get him,
or wait for him to come out?
- Let him come out.

617
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,590
- There's too many unknowns in there.
- He's right.

618
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,277
Show me.

619
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,437
When we drive up the car,
make sure it's at an angle about
three feet away from the kurb.

620
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,755
- We put our best man high ground.
Is Anderson here?
- Yes.

621
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,917
Good. Okay,
twenty degrees down angle.

622
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,032
Tell Anderson to prep and
notify us when he's on line.

623
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,357
- I can feel this thing
going sideways on us.
- Well, there's some good news.

624
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,357
He's wearing a ski mask,
so he's protecting his identity...

625
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,951
and he hasn't determined
whether or not he's gonna kill
the rest of the hostages yet.

626
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,229
You. You! Up, up!

627
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,272
Start pullin' those bodies back
behind that counter. Let's go.

628
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,439
Do it! Move!
Let's go! Come on!

629
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,959
Back behind here.
Faster! Let's go.

630
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,834
- He's gonna-- He's gonna--
He's gonna kill us.
- Please. It's gonna be--

631
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,111
Over there. Over there.
In there.

632
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,670
- I'm not, I'm not staying here.
I'm not staying here.
- No.

633
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,031
- No, please don't. please don't.
Mrs Dotson, please don't go!
- Let go of me!

634
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,197
- Mrs Dotson, please!
- Hey. Hey!

635
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,914
- Stop, Miss Dotson.
- Hey!

636
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,919
- Leave her alone.
- What?
- Leave her alone!

637
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,593
Think.

638
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,679
Doug, please,
sit down, sit down!

639
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,879
If she's not conscious by
the time I'm done, she's dead.

640
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,556
- What do you got, window?
- We have some confirmation.

641
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,278
Okay, it's time to give
this wacko a call.

642
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,068
How come he's not answering?

643
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,036
Wait, wait, wait.
There's your answer.

644
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,269
- He's smart.
- He's cuttin' down visibility.

645
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,790
Yep. He's doin'
a good job of it.

646
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,992
All positions:
you have a green light.

647
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,635
Come on. Give us
one clean shot, asshole.

648
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:37,039
Command one, repeat. All positions:
you have a green light.

649
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,196
He switched clothes.
That's Korda!

650
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:44,314
- That's Korda! Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

651
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,193
- I said hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

652
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,437
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

653
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,472
- Come on!
- No! No!
- Come here. Get inside!

654
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,556
Please, let me go!

655
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,433
- Get in!
- Please!

656
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,313
- Bunch of fuck ups!
- Get him on the radio.
Get him on the radio!
- These your keys?

657
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,556
- What? Yeah, yeah. Those are mine.
- He's got a girl. Let's go!
- Wait, wait, wait!

658
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,114
Hey, Roper,
what are you gonna do?

659
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,037
No!

660
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,352
Additional units in the area. We need
all additional units in the area.

661
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,630
Oh, oh, please, God!

662
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,671
Hey, watch it!

663
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,155
Stop!

664
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,355
- Please!
- Suspect heading west on
Sutter, now passing Laguna.

665
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,199
Can we get an intercept?

666
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,436
Move! Move that!
Come on, now!

667
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,157
- Ahh! Let me out! Please!
- Shut up.

668
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,994
Please! Oh!

669
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,197
Everybody okay?

670
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,117
Just stay there, man.

671
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,236
What's going on?

672
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,391
- Hey, man, what's this?
- Get the fuck off.

673
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,636
Oh, oh! Oh!

674
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,709
Everybody just stay calm.

675
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,469
- Fuck! Get out of my way.
- Just take it easy.

676
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,068
- What?
- Just take it easy. Put the gun down.

677
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,918
Put the gun down.

678
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,670
Hey!

679
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,679
- What the fuck is going on?
- I don't know,
but I gotta get up there.

680
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,152
Shit!

681
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,275
- Get the fuck off of me.
- Hold the wheel.

682
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,277
- What?
- Take the wheel.
You got it? You got it?

683
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,156
Shut up!

684
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,356
Uh! Oh!

685
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,515
Ahh!

686
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,076
Get out of the way.

687
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,114
- What's the problem?
- I can't get the brakes to work!

688
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,516
We're comin' to the end
of the line!

689
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,917
Oh, shit.

690
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,110
- Get the car steady!
- Come on!

691
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,630
Go! Move ahead!

692
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,990
Hard right!

693
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,914
Get out of the way!

694
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,315
Get out of the way!

695
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,555
Move!

696
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:20,355
- Oh, my God! What's happened?
- What the hell is that?

697
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,829
Outta the way!

698
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,269
Move!

699
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,477
- It's that guy down there!
- There! There! He's runnin'!

700
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,434
- Hey, he's gettin' away!
- Somebody stop him!

701
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,790
Get him!

702
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,469
Shit! I lost my piece.

703
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,517
- God bless SWAT.
- Ready?

704
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,313
You check this floor.
I'm goin' up.

705
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,196
Shit!

706
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,553
Hold it! Don't you move!
Don't you fuckin' move!

707
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,389
Stay right there! Right there!
Put your hands up! Put 'em up!

708
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,351
Spread your fuckin' legs.

709
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,278
Fuckin' move, I'll put
your fuckin' head in the trunk.

710
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,957
Sam Baffert
was a friend of mine.

711
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,231
He had a wife
and he had a daughter.

712
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,875
Why don't you tell that
to somebody who gives a shit?

713
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,034
Wanna kill me,
lnspector? Huh?

714
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:36,512
- You can't kill me.
- Oh, I can't?

715
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,676
Well, what if we got
into a struggle...

716
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,633
and my gun went off?

717
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,557
Could I kill you then?

718
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,069
Huh? Could I kill you then?

719
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,357
Roper!

720
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,517
You got him.

721
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,228
Put the gun down.

722
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,555
You got him, man.
Put it down.

723
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,037
Come on, man.
Put it down.

724
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,397
I'm gonna do this shit
by the book...

725
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,751
but you ain't gonna be
fuckin' smiling at me.

726
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,677
Gimme your hands.

727
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,829
Come on. Get up.

728
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,757
Get up. Come on.

729
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,397
- Listen, I'll catch up
with you guys later.
- Okay. See ya.

730
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,317
- Wanna get something to eat?
- Yeah.

731
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,997
Yeah. Can you hold up?

732
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,072
You weren't
at the press conference.

733
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,593
I wanted to get this
out of the way first.

734
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:32,029
Well, have you got a bet
on the game tonight?

735
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,232
As a matter of fact, I do
have a bet on the game tonight.

736
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:38,272
Of course you do. Then
you know it's already started.

737
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:43,076
Well, I was gonna catch
the last half on TV later on.

738
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,316
Well, good night.

739
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,035
You havin' dinner
with Mr Baseball?

740
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:58,277
Greg is actually
on a road trip.

741
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,831
I was just gonna go home
and make myself some pasta.

742
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,236
Mmm. Go home
and make some pasta.

743
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,794
The one with the garlic
and the oil that I like so much?

744
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:11,229
No, the kind you get
out of a box.

745
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,157
The macaroni and the cheese.

746
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,396
The instant macaroni?

747
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:19,354
Mmm. I've been craving
that stuff all week.

748
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,948
Yeah, it's hard to get.

749
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,877
Well, who are you tellin'?

750
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,590
- Just dinner.
- Yeah, just dinner.

751
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:36,197
What the fuck. You bring me
all the ways over to tell me
you ain't got no collateral?

752
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,039
What do I look like to you, Santa Claus?
I'm a fuckin' bail bondsman.

753
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,832
I know, I know. That's not what
I'm saying. What I'm saying--

754
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,837
Pick up the phone,
for Christ's sake.

755
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,996
- You think I got time for
messing around with this crap?
- I got the stuff.

756
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:48,237
It's on the outside. I'm just
waiting for somebody to cash in,
that's all. It's real simple.

757
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,954
Give me a fuckin' break.

758
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:55,392
Look. Just gimme your card.
I'll get it to you by tomorrow night.

759
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,157
Thanks.

760
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,597
Okay. Now, that's
the freshly ground pepper.

761
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,517
Stir it briskly.
Are you listening?

762
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:12,677
You stir it briskly. Then you
need lemon. I need lemon.

763
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,997
- Should be one in the fridge.
- Lemon in the refrigerator.

764
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:19,078
- Hey, you know the last
quarter of the game is on.
- Oh, really?

765
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,350
What game is that?

766
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,835
Oh, whoa.
You are making an effort.

767
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,428
That's right, and I'm gonna win too.
I'm going to be the victor.

768
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,676
I'm going to score.

769
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,394
Metaphorically speaking, of course.
I don't mean, like, really score.

770
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,476
- You know what I mean.
- Just dinner, remember.

771
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:37,309
I know the rules. Just dinner. Just
dinner. Okay, I got this lemon in here.

772
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,829
Now, when you taste this...

773
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,475
I want you to know that you're gonna
be experiencing culinary perfection.

774
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,319
Now just calm d-- Calm-- Calm down.
I'm giving you background on this.

775
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,670
This is the bomb salad
dressing that I bring...

776
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,394
to all the cookouts
whenever my family gathers.

777
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,511
They say, "Scott, bring--"
"Scott." Here. You ready?

778
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,870
Taste this. Huh?

779
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,993
- Is that not the bomb?
That is the shit, right there.
- Mmm.

780
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,588
Honestly?
Something's missing.

781
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,792
Oh, no, that's not missing
anything. You're just jealous
'cause you don't know how to--

782
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:10,471
See, in the UK they don't teach you how
to make this, see? This is perfection.

783
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,760
You know, it does need
a little sugar.

784
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,871
Why don't you put your finger in there
for the proper sweetness.

785
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,470
- Scott.
- It's a joke. It's a-- It's a--
It's a compliment to you.

786
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,034
I could have said you could-- "Why
don't you put your ass in this bowl."

787
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,957
It-- That's a joke.
'Cause they're all sweetness.

788
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,389
I don't see how you're offended because
that's very-- That's a compliment.

789
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,795
If somebody told me to put my ass
in a bowl of salad dressing...

790
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,717
I would be complimented.

791
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,990
What would you say
if I gave up gambling?

792
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,630
I'd say you'd be miserable.

793
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:54,318
It's not so much the gambling. It's more
what the gambling got in the way of.

794
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,237
The track is where you
would take your troubles...

795
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,396
instead of sharing them
with me.

796
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:06,429
Scott, do you remember when you lost
that hostage on Union Square?

797
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,313
Yes, I do.

798
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,477
You came here that night
and you made love to me...

799
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:16,593
and it was so intense and so passionate,
but you hadn't even talked to me.

800
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,871
I didn't even know what happened until
I saw it on the news the next morning.

801
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,309
Now, that's because I don't want you
to be part of that world, Ronnie.

802
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:25,637
Yeah, that's the point.
It's not that world.

803
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,320
It's your world.

804
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,749
It's part of who you are.

805
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:48,274
Look, Ronnie,
it's not easy for me.

806
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,675
Okay? And I know
I can't change overnight.

807
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,712
But listen to me.

808
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,717
I know that I miss you...

809
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,593
and I don't ever want
to be without you again.

810
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,275
I'd really like
to believe you.

811
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,994
Well, then believe me.

812
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,477
Nobody asked you anything.

813
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,957
I missed you.

814
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,757
I'm Officer McCall.
What's goin' on?

815
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,314
What the fuck do you mean, what's goin'
on? I'll tell ya what's goin' on.

816
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,749
I'm about to fuckin' waste
everybody in here, pal!

817
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,394
Okay, I'm a hostage negotiator.
I'm here to help you.

818
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,397
How the hell are you
gonna help me, pig?

819
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,672
Screw you, man!
Fuck you, dude!

820
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,553
- Well, I want you to tell me
what you need.
- What do I need?

821
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,511
I'll tell you
what I fuckin' need, man.

822
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:25,634
I need you to fuckin' find
that dirtbag that fuckin'
ran off with my wife, dude...

823
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,752
so I can cut his
fuckin' balls off, man.

824
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,190
- Okay, l-l can't do that.
- You can't fuckin' do it?

825
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,392
Why am I wasting my
fuckin' time with you, man?

826
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,514
You piece of fuckin' frog shit,
piece of shit asshole!

827
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,518
Hey, hey, is all
the name-calling necessary?
I don't like the verbal abuse.

828
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,870
No, not really, but I like
to throw all that in there...

829
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,117
you know, to kind of give it
the natural ambience, you know?

830
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:55,869
I'm Officer McCall.
I'm unarmed.

831
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,877
I just want to make sure everybody
gets out of here safely.

832
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,911
Okay, stop right there.
Close your eyes.

833
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,474
- Okay.
- Tell me what you see.

834
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,636
I see a scumbag behind
the counter with a sawed-off.

835
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,990
Nine-millimetre tucked away
in his waistband.

836
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,395
There's a female hostage down
in front of the cereal rack...

837
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,317
with a red polka-dot dress.

838
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,637
Another hostage three feet to her right,
with blue jeans and a checkered shirt.

839
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:18,799
A male hostage down, green shirt,
white pants, in front of the candy rack.

840
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,718
There's a female scumbag behind me
with a gun tucked away in her shirt...

841
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,717
trying to pass herself off
as a hostage.

842
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,912
And there's a special
on toilet paper, four for $1.29.

843
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,837
That's a lot of toilet paper.

844
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,679
- Am I right?
- That's pretty good. You got good eyes.

845
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,791
- You like that?
- Very impressive.

846
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,757
How you doin', Mike?
Doin' all right?

847
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:48,189
How the fuck
do you think I'm doin'?

848
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,318
I got something
I want you to do for me.

849
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:56,513
This fucker Roper,
he's got a girlfriend.

850
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,398
She works at the newspaper.

851
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:04,479
So-- What do you wa--
What do you--

852
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,989
No, Mike. No, Mike, come on. You
know that's not my thing, right?

853
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,475
Hey, don't gimme any shit, Clarence.
I'm in here because of you!

854
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,319
Mikey, come on, man.
You know you--

855
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,557
You were just robbin' a store,
and he was doin' his job.

856
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:22,477
Fuck you!

857
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:28,670
- Oh, Mike.
- I carried you your whole life, okay?

858
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,189
You needed money.
You needed a place to stay.

859
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:35,108
You were strung out. Bail.
This time you are there for me.

860
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,037
Mikey, don't do this to me,
please.

861
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,798
- You do it!
- I ain't gonna get away with it, Mike.

862
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,990
You just fuckin' do it!

863
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,197
Guard!

864
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,151
Oh, fuck. God!

865
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,316
- Hello?
- Hey, how you doin'?

866
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,954
Look, I'm gonna stop at the corner and
get some wine. I got the bread already.

867
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:37,039
- Dinner will be ready soon.
- Okay, good. I'm starving.

868
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,230
All right.
I'll see you later.

869
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,789
- Find it, sir?
- Yeah, I found it.

870
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,360
- Thanks.
- That all for you?

871
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,191
Here you go.

872
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,157
Thanks a lot.

873
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,476
No!

874
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,671
Ow!

875
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,157
Help me!

876
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,995
Help me!

877
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,557
Ronnie!

878
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,274
Ronnie!

879
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,031
You okay?

880
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,957
Yeah.

881
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,157
Watch it!

882
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:45,116
Oh!

883
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,392
If you try to hurt me
or anybody else I know...

884
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:31,717
I swear to God I'm gonna find
a way to get in here, and I'm
gonna bust your fuckin' ass!

885
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,274
Then I'm gonna put my gun in your mouth
and blow your fuckin' brains out.

886
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,197
- You understand?
- I don't even know what
you're talking about.

887
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,390
- You know what the fuck
I'm talking about.
- No, I'm afraid I do not.

888
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,112
- Don't fuckin' play games with me.
You know what the fuck I'm talk--
- No, I don't.

889
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,037
You don't know what the fuck
I'm talking about?

890
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:45,232
You see this guy here?
That's your cousin, right?

891
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,510
Well, the guy with the white
gloves on is the coroner.

892
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,756
That's what the fuck
I'm talking about.

893
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,110
I'm talking about not playing
with me, motherfucker.

894
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:55,152
Don't fuck with me, man.
I'm not playing with you.

895
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,592
You know, in Naples,
there's an expression.

896
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,950
"When you think you're fuckin'
them, they're fuckin' you."

897
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,833
Well, you know what? You ain't in
motherfuckin' Naples right now.

898
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:12,032
Fuck that Naples shit. Did you hear
what the fuck I just told you?

899
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:14,549
I don't give a fuck...

900
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:18,389
about anything or anybody.

901
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,159
Not now.

902
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,670
Least of all a nigger cop
interferes with what's mine.

903
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,713
And what is mine is
ten million dollars' worth.

904
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,637
You come in here.
You threaten me.

905
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:34,275
Show me a photo
of my dead cousin, my family.

906
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,957
I got at least ten years
in here to figure out...

907
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:42,278
exactly how to fuck with you
and everything you care about.

908
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,868
Hey, fuck you!
You don't give a fuck?

909
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,468
I don't give a fuck neither, man.
I don't give a fuck about you.

910
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,431
Fucker! Try me!

911
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:52,120
Fuckin' try me and see what
the fuck-- Get the fuck off me!

912
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,037
You try me!

913
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,757
- Where's my pasta?
- It's coming.

914
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,838
- You enjoying San Francisco?
- Oh, I love it.

915
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:08,520
Have you been
to the deYoung Museum?

916
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,597
Sorry.

917
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,236
Thank you.

918
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:29,477
Thank you so much.

919
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,309
It has an excellent nose. It's quite
vintage, and you may serve it up.

920
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,715
- Thank you.
- This evening's specials:

921
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:39,992
we have grilled squab
with a sweet potato foie gras...

922
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:43,032
spring roll with a wild
huckleberry sauce.

923
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,799
We also are offering
braised sweetbreads...

924
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,832
with a white truffle sauce
on cracked bulgur.

925
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,757
- Cracked bulgur?
- Mm-hmm.

926
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,917
You know, my mouth has been screaming
for some cracked bulgur all week.

927
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,837
Can we have a couple of minutes
to look at the menu?

928
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:59,669
-Oh, sure. Take your time.
-Man can't live on cracked bulgur alone.

929
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,074
-Nice place, huh?
-Yeah, I think it's really nice.

930
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:10,909
- Bit expensive, though.
- Very, very, very expensive.

931
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,837
In fact, it's costing me
quite a pretty penny...

932
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,554
to wine and dine you in such fashion,
so I hope you're appreciative of it.

933
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,636
Mmm, but I think
I'm worth it.

934
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,796
I think you're worth it too.

935
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:24,198
In fact, this is the perfect
setting for my little plan.

936
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:28,438
You see, I know you know that
there's a very important reason...

937
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,869
why I wanted to have dinner
with you tonight.

938
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,956
I didn't realize that
at all, no.

939
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:36,311
Veronica, this last week
has been incredible for me.

940
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:38,396
You know, l--
I don't know.

941
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:41,193
I feel like our relationship went
to the next phase or something...

942
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,515
and kind of crystallized
into this new thing...

943
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:45,631
and I'm hoping
that the feeling's mutual.

944
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,557
Well, yeah,
of course it's mutual.

945
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,910
Good. Because, Veronica...

946
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,952
there comes a time
in every relationship...

947
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,799
where things
get more serious.

948
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,310
- Yeah?
- The last week I have
rehearsed this so many times.

949
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,477
I have been sittin' and tryin'
to figure out the best way to do this.

950
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,397
And I said, "This--
This is the perfect setting."

951
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:08,035
You got the perfect dress
and the perfect face and--

952
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,957
I think I should
just show you.

953
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:13,390
Oh, no, no. Listen, we haven't
even spoken about this, Scottie.

954
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,080
This is gonna be really embarrassing.
Come on, please, can we--

955
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,035
Huh?

956
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,595
- Tahiti?
- Tahiti, yes.

957
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,915
- Vacation?
- Yes, a vacation to Tahiti.

958
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:32,033
You and l. Two trips.
Round-trip tickets to Tahiti, yes?

959
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,549
- Yeah, that I'll do.
- What do you mean, "that"?

960
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,592
-What did you think I was gonna ask you?
-Well, come on.

961
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:40,678
- The way you were talking it was like--
- Oh, wait, wait. Ho-ho-ho-ho--

962
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,997
Let's go to Tahiti first.
Make it a little road test, huh?

963
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,429
- So, are we gonna go to Tahiti?
Did you say yes?
- That is a yes.

964
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,357
We're going to--
We're going to Tahiti.

965
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,675
- Stop it.
- We're go-- Hey, I don't--
They not gonna be there.

966
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,597
They ain't gonna never see us
no more. Let's toast it.

967
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,359
To Tahiti.
To being "nekked" in Tahiti.

968
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,755
- Come on, say it. Nekked in Tahiti.
- Naked in Tahiti.

969
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:00,235
- Not "naked in Tahiti."
- That's how I say it.

970
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,191
- Nekked.
- Nekked.

971
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,788
There you go.
Say, "nekked in Tahiti."

972
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,751
Hold it.
Let me picture you nekked.

973
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:12,031
Oh, look at the sun
bouncin' off your ass.

974
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,957
I'm just playin'.

975
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,432
If it's not here by 5:00,
it's not my problem.

976
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,357
Oh, don't talk to me
about Mitch.

977
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,277
I'm runnin' this shift,
not Mitch.

978
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,516
- I don't care.
- Got another load.

979
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:26,915
Uh, rack 'em.

980
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:31,113
Yeah, well you got the memo
from, uh, from City Hall too, right?

981
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:35,518
I've got 'em right here.
No, they went down at 9:30 to San Bruno.

982
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:38,871
Yeah, they've got the old forms. The new
forms have the wrong date or something.

983
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,195
Ninety-one or ninety-two.
I don't know.

984
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,117
Yeah.

985
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,993
Yeah, well, don't give me
any grief about it.

986
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:47,917
No, Frank told me.

987
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:52,869
Look, l-l can't spend
any more time on this, okay?

988
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,797
That's it. All done.

989
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,310
Yeah. Well, no. Well, you can
tell that to Mitch too.

990
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,193
Okay? Don't call me
on this any more.

991
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:08,553
Yeah, well, don't give me
any grief about it.

992
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,195
Hey, don't you guys
keep notes down there?

993
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,628
How come in those foreign movies
a young girl always falls
in love with a old fat guy?

994
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,593
Well, I guess women in Europe
find older men sexy.

995
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,836
Cool. Shit.

996
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,996
When I get old and fat...

997
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,111
I'm definitely movin'
to Europe.

998
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:08,118
- That guy was 60 years old.
- Shit. I forgot to feed Troy.

999
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:10,390
I bet he's just starving.

1000
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,670
Troy, where are you, baby?
I'm sorry.

1001
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,075
Troy?

1002
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,997
Troy, where are you hiding?

1003
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,917
Troy?

1004
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,600
My eyes are still hurtin'
from readin' that movie.

1005
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:30,799
Troy? I've got
food for you.

1006
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,717
Troy?

1007
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,837
Where are you?

1008
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:58,354
Scott, have you seen--
Hey, baby, there you are! Yes!

1009
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:02,439
Hey, have you been eating my face
soap again? You have, haven't you?

1010
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:08,072
- Scott, what is it?
- Korda escaped.

1011
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,353
- Korda's escaped?
- This morning.

1012
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,511
You don't think
he'd try and--

1013
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:18,154
Well, I'm-- I'm just a little
on edge. I need to relax.

1014
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:21,192
I'm sure he's gonna try to get
out of town, and we're leaving
tomorrow anyway, you know?

1015
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:25,950
I'm sorry about that.
I just overreacted, okay? Okay?

1016
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:31,550
Why don't we feed the dog before
we have Cujo on our hands, huh?

1017
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:43,673
You packed everything? You're
sure you didn't forget your
bowling ball or your, you know.

1018
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,950
I sent that ahead,
you wise guy.

1019
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:49,277
You're bringing a lot of clothes
to a place where you're not supposed
to wear a lot of clothes.

1020
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:52,198
Hey, honey, don't you think it would be
better if you stayed in the house until
we're ready to get out of here?

1021
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,515
- No, I'm gonna stay here
and help you guys.
- No, I'm not playin'.

1022
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:58,030
- I think you should go
in the house, you know?
- Hold up a second.

1023
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:03,029
We are going to Tahiti. We're
gonna have a great time, and you
are gonna forget everything.

1024
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:05,754
Everything.
So just calm down.

1025
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,030
I'm calm. Don't I look--
Look at me.

1026
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:13,310
There, see? I just think it'd be better
if you went in the house, all right?

1027
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:17,149
- I'll get my cameras
and I'll be straight back.
- Well, take your time then, all right?

1028
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,919
- Man!
- You've gotta relax.

1029
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,837
- Hey, I'm-- I'm relaxed.
- Gotta calm down.

1030
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:24,679
Man, I don't want-- I don't want
nothin' else to go wrong.

1031
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,597
Ronnie! Come on, now.

1032
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,390
Veronica!

1033
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:33,796
Come on! They said we gotta be there
a hour and a half early to check in.

1034
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,195
What are you doing?

1035
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,436
Come on, Ronnie. Hey!

1036
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:44,350
Ronnie. How long it take to get
some camera equipment, huh?

1037
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:53,837
Ronnie?

1038
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,156
Veronica!

1039
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:02,035
What's that, Troy?
ls she out there? Huh, man?

1040
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:05,550
Is she? Watch it.
Hey. Veronica!

1041
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,591
Roper, what's up?

1042
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,517
What is it?

1043
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,995
You missin' something,
Roper?

1044
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:40,270
I got it.

1045
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:44,916
You got something that belongs
to me and I want it back.

1046
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:49,670
4:15, tomorrow. Mare lsland,
north entrance, off Dixon.

1047
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,155
You pull up to berth 16.

1048
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:55,989
I so much as smell another cop, I'll be
sending you pieces of her for a month.

1049
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:02,908
He's gonna kill her
no matter what.

1050
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:07,033
- If I take him those jewels,
he's gonna kill me and her.
- So what do you want to do?

1051
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:09,594
Scott, we go back a long ways,
but you can't expect me to do this.

1052
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:12,029
Frank, this guy's a psychopath
and he has Ronnie.

1053
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:15,038
- It's the only way
I'm gonna get close to him.
- Then go to the lieutenant
or the DA with it.

1054
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:17,549
For Christ's sakes, this is my fucking
job you're asking me to lay on the line.

1055
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:19,557
They're not gonna approve it,
and you know that.

1056
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:22,148
If I get the department involved
in this shit, she's dead.
This guy's a fuckin' maniac.

1057
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:26,592
He killed Sam, and he'd kill her. I got
one shot at this guy, Frank, alone.

1058
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,517
Man, what if it was Mary? You
know you'd do the same thing.

1059
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:32,076
You'd break every fuckin'
rule in the book. Wouldn't you?

1060
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,035
I just hope to God I never
have to make that decision.

1061
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:47,309
This conversation never happened.
I never saw you today.

1062
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,753
Now I gotta go take a leak.

1063
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,757
This place is
an abandoned shipyard.

1064
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:13,836
He's gonna be able to get a good
vantage point from anywhere.

1065
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:16,030
There's cranes, abandoned
buildings, everything.

1066
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,958
He's gonna be able
to see everything we do.

1067
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:21,355
You're gonna have to figure out
a way to sneak me in here.

1068
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:00,108
Korda!

1069
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:06,199
Korda!

1070
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:10,074
Roper! Nice of
you to make it.

1071
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:13,112
Now, take the jacket off
and put it on the hood.

1072
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,879
Good. Let's have
a look at that tarp.

1073
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,594
Under the tarp
in the back.

1074
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:26,554
Pull it back.
Pull it back!

1075
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,830
Now, over there to your right.
You see that concrete block?

1076
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:36,714
There's a radio on it.
Walk to it.

1077
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:41,231
That's it. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1078
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:55,592
Uh, before you touch it,
you throw away your piece.

1079
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,475
Good.
And your backup too.

1080
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,875
Do it.

1081
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:16,471
Pick up the bag.
Bring it to me.

1082
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:20,591
You walk past those
cranes on your right.

1083
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:22,756
You get to the end,
you make a left.

1084
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:25,792
At the end of that building,
you go to your right.

1085
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:29,189
Walk to building 36.

1086
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:50,070
That's it. Keep comin'.

1087
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:53,112
That's good. Right there.

1088
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:57,836
Come on in. Somebody's
dyin' to say hello.

1089
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:05,355
Ah, shit.

1090
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,675
Scott!

1091
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,111
- Shit.
- Hey.

1092
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,877
Over to the table.

1093
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:53,156
- Open your shirt.
- Hey, I'm not wearing a wire.
This is between me and you.

1094
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:56,078
Fuck you. Open the shirt.

1095
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,271
Okay?

1096
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:08,629
- Where are you, McCall?
- Right here, Roper.

1097
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:16,553
- You satisfied?
- Open the bag. Dump it on the table.

1098
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,475
- Pick something up.
- What?

1099
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,912
Nope. Closer to the front
of the pile. There. Let's go.

1100
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:45,069
Stay put.

1101
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:05,239
That's impressive.

1102
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:08,989
- What the fuck did you
have to do, steal 'em?
- Yeah, I stole it.

1103
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,111
That ain't gonna look too good
on the old service record.

1104
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:14,789
You let me worry about that. Let's just
get this shit over with, all right?

1105
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:17,514
A man after my own heart.
Here you go.

1106
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:19,915
Fill it up.

1107
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:34,430
Come on, man. Bring him out.
Move him out.

1108
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,790
Step out.

1109
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,309
That's far enough.
Right there.

1110
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:48,273
- Bag on the floor.
- I'm not puttin' the bag on the floor.

1111
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,356
I took care of my part of this shit,
now you let my girl go.

1112
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:53,153
Scott, just do what he says.
Please just do it!

1113
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:57,114
- Hey, Ronnie, relax. We're
gonna get us out of here.
- That I gotta see.

1114
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:59,959
Just a little more.

1115
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:04,429
No! No! Scott!

1116
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:09,312
Hey!

1117
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:11,237
Back off.

1118
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,155
Don't move.

1119
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,834
Shit. Damn it.

1120
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:25,670
I rewired this switch. So you keep
your finger on the red button.

1121
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:28,598
Otherwise
it gets kinda messy.

1122
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:30,676
Such a nice neck too.

1123
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,314
- Shit.
- Now, walk to me.

1124
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:40,595
That's it, right there.
Right there. Put the bag down.

1125
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:46,799
Now, real nice,
you kick over what's mine.

1126
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:51,791
Oh, no! Please, Scott!

1127
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,958
Remember what I said?
Remember that?

1128
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:02,232
When you think you're fuckin'
them, they're fuckin' you.

1129
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:06,510
You just got fucked.

1130
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:15,079
Gotta go. Got a plane to catch.
Oh, shit, look at this.

1131
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:19,239
Got my car here and, uh, that's
the only exit. Only way out.

1132
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:22,113
You're standin' right
in front of it.

1133
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:24,435
Now, you can move, but--

1134
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,514
Scott, what's he doing?

1135
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,910
Damn.

1136
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:56,270
Scott, move.

1137
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:03,908
Get out of the way!
Do it now, Scott!

1138
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:08,191
McCall, stop the--

1139
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,197
What car?

1140
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:16,113
- Please move!
- Take a shot!

1141
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:46,193
Scott, please!

1142
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:57,550
Come on! Please, help me!

1143
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:11,714
Come on, Scott!

1144
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:04,717
- Stay in here.
- No, what--

1145
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:07,115
Stay inside, Ronnie!
Stay here!

1146
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:17,434
- McCall!
- He went around that way.

1147
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:20,632
- Fuck, man, how bad you hit?
- He went down that way.

1148
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:24,594
- You all right?
- I'm okay. Get him!

1149
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:04,912
Hey!

1150
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:15,670
Motherfucker!

1151
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:19,070
Get the fuck open!

1152
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:24,794
Oh, really?
That's a bad idea.

1153
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:27,673
I'll show you.

1154
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:39,348
I've never seen a sky so blue
and a sea so clear.

1155
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:41,596
This place is amazing.

1156
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:46,953
Yeah. Yep, I could really
get used to this paradise shit.

1157
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:50,679
Oh, excuse me, miss?

1158
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:54,554
Can you get me another
pina colada? And this time,
can you shave the ice for me?

1159
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:59,151
- Oui, monsieur. Right away.
- Oui, monsieur. Right away.
That's very nice to hear.

1160
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:09,635
That's some smooth shit,
French.

1161
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:15,076
Scott?

1162
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:20,115
- There's something really special
I want to talk to you about.
- What's that?

1163
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:24,552
I think it's time for this relationship
to go to another level. A deeper level.

1164
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:31,557
- A deeper level?
- I think this is it.

1165
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:36,754
Here and now, we should strip
down and get nekked in Tahiti.

1166
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:42,276
Oh, you're talkin' about
gettin' naked in Tahiti.

1167
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:45,278
I thought you was talkin' about
the "M" word just now when you was--

1168
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:48,392
- The "M" word? What do you
think I was talking about?
- You know.

1169
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:52,157
- What, marriage?
- Why you laughin'?

1170
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:55,033
The way you said all that.
You know, us needing to go to
a deeper level. And, you know--

1171
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:57,720
Ah, but you did say that you would
get naked on the beach in Tahiti.

1172
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:00,957
No, I didn't say naked on
the beach in Tahiti. I said,
"Let's get nekked in Tahiti."

1173
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:03,230
The hotel room is in Tahiti too.
I'm not gonna get nekked on the beach.

1174
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:05,555
-You're a prude.
-I'm not a prude. I'm just not dumb to--

1175
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:07,830
- These are strangers.
- Prude.

1176
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:10,269
I'm not getting nekked on no beach in--
And we can go to the room.

1177
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,789
I'll take off my clothes and run around
nekked for you. And, incidentally...

1178
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:16,151
that thong in the suitcase,
that's not gettin' worn on the beach.

1179
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:18,236
- Sorry.
- Yeah. I'm very disappointed.

1180
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:20,157
You didn't even try it on
and I bought it for you.

1181
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:23,158
That's for me? lmagine me
in some shit like that.

1182
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:25,111
You actually bought--
You actually bought that for me?

1183
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:28,471
-It would look cute on your ass.
-Oh, get out. Right, yeah. Girl, please.

1184
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:32,195
What if one of my mother's
friends was down here and see me
walkin' around in that shit?

1185
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:34,117
- Don't bring your mother into this.
- I'm not. That's--

1186
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:37,357
This is a small world. Somebody
that knows my mother see me
in that shit, then they...

1187
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:42,156
"Ooh, girl, Miss Roper's son
be on the beach in Tahiti with
his ass out, on his vacation.

1188
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:45,670
Watch him, girl. Mm-hmm. I see
he had a string up his ass."

1189
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:48,951
Get the fuck outta here.
Not-Not today.

1190
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:52,358
This is for
the $100-billers

1191
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:56,473
Look up
One, two, three, kick it

1192
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:59,990
O yeah
It feel so good

1193
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:04,318
To be back
where we belong

1194
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:06,237
Come on
Give it up

1195
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:08,635
O yeah

1196
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,637
It feel so good

1197
01:49:10,760 --> 01:49:14,389
This is where we started from

1198
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:17,114
- Come on, girl
- Stand right by me, Ronnie

1199
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:19,834
Everybody, let's take a ride

1200
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:22,554
- Everybody, just come inside
- Come on

1201
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:25,274
On a journey
let's go back in time

1202
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:27,675
I'll be tellin' rhyme

1203
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:30,234
Everybody, it's time to play

1204
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:32,954
Come on, everybody
Let yo' discman sway

1205
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:35,196
Forget all the other sounds

1206
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:38,869
'Cause New Edition
is what's going down

1207
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,549
Now the time has come

1208
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:45,433
To return as one

1209
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:47,994
And it's never been better

1210
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:50,554
- Get down
- Get down

1211
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:53,194
I never thought
this day would come

1212
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:55,914
And it feels so good to me

1213
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:59,749
- To be back where we belong
- Come on, y'all, come on

1214

- O yeah

Been too long
It's time to get in the mood

1225
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:37,674

1226

Playin' C-low with the gamblers

Placin' bets
