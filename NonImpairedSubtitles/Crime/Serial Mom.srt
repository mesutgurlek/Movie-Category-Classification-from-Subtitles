Excuse me, I...

1266
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:52,954
Mr. Pickles, did you see
anyone in the booth next to you?

1267
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:57,226
I'm not sure... I...

1268
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:58,822
What do you mean
you're not sure?

1269
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:01,768
There was nobody next to me.

1270
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:04,304
Mr. Pickles, didn't
you tell the Grand Jury

1271
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:06,033
that you looked down and you saw

1272
01:24:06,107 --> 01:24:10,669
a pair of ladies' shoes
in the booth next to you?

1273
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:12,372
I just said what you told me to.

1274
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:13,846
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

1275
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:17,349
Perjury is a serious
offense, Mr. Pickles.

1276
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:25,793
I... I made it all up! I've never
seen Beverly Sutphin in my life!

1277
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:26,884
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

1278
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:29,657
You'll pay for this,
Marvin Pickles.

1279
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:35,899
I'm turning your file
over to the vice squad.

1280
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:43,271
The prosecution rests.

1281
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:52,280
The prosecution has
proven nothing, Your Honor.

1282
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:54,150
The defense
rests also!

1283
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:03,259
JUDGE: Order.
Order in the courtroom.

1284
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,632
We'll take
a 10-minute recess.

1285
01:25:07,702 --> 01:25:10,296
Attorneys, be ready with
your closing arguments.

1286
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:13,838
Well, I feel that
Beverly Sutphin

1287
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:16,308
is an innocent woman,
wrongly accused.

1288
01:25:16,644 --> 01:25:21,411
A normal housewife trapped in a
nightmare of circumstantial evidence.

1289
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:30,687
There she is, Henrietta
Lee Lucas, Joan Wayne Gacy.

1290
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:35,718
A new face in the deck of
serial killer trading cards.

1291
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:44,329
Find her guilty on all six
counts of first-degree murder.

1292
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:48,865
I only hope I can portray Serial
Mom's life on the TV screen

1293
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:54,381
with the proper dignity that
this feminist heroine deserves.

1294
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:59,977
Look at me. I am as
normal as all of you.

1295
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:05,751
But I have been
framed by the police

1296
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:12,499
and perjured against by the very
people I thought were my friends.

1297
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:14,925
All I ask of you...
Stop that!

1298
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:20,735
...is that you have the
courage to find me innocent

1299
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:24,209
of these terribly
untrue charges.

1300
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,976
All I ask is that you find me

1301
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:31,712
innocent of these
terribly untrue charges.

1302
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:54,003
Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, have you reached a verdict?

1303
01:26:54,075 --> 01:26:55,975
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

1304
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:03,915
We find the defendant
not guilty of all charges.

1305
01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:11,653
Way to go, Beverly!

1306
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:17,125
Oh! I'm coming home!

1307
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:24,933
What should I do?

1308
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:27,167
I don't know. Bring her home, I guess.

1309
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,767
No more violence.
No more violence.

1310
01:27:29,844 --> 01:27:31,334
You think
she'll like me?

1311
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:37,313
Just be nice to her and try...
Try not to get on her nerves.

1312
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:42,848
WOMAN 1: She got off.

1313
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,016
WOMAN 2: She's innocent!

1314
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,423
Congratulations, Beverly.
Will you be staying...

1315
01:27:45,493 --> 01:27:47,427
Hello, Baltimore!
I love you.

1316
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:49,122
Oh, I love you, too.

1317
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:52,825
Thank you all for coming. Hi,
there, LA. Hello, Cleveland.

1318
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:53,924
MAN: Hey, Serial Mom!

1319
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,162
Well, hello, New York!

1320

REPORTER: Beverly, who does your hair?

1321
01:27:59,474 --> 01:28:00,463
Excuse me!

1322
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:02,041
Would you hold these for me, honey?

1323
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:03,168
Excuse me.

1324
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:05,769
Excuse me, Mr. Sutphin, can
I ask you a question, please?

1325
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:08,042
Did the system work?
Do you think it worked?

1326
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:10,243
Excuse me. The rights have been sold.

1327
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:12,252
We did it.
We set her free!

1328
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,584
I knew she was innocent
right from the beginning.

1329
01:28:21,229 --> 01:28:23,959
You can't wear white
shoes after Labor Day.

1330
01:28:24,032 --> 01:28:25,556
That's not
true anymore.

1331
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:29,160
Yes, it is. Didn't your
mother ever tell you?

(GRUNTS)

1333
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:32,538
Now you know.

1334
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:38,172
No, please.
Fashion has changed.

1335
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:39,770
No, it hasn't.

1336
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:42,605
REPORTER: Are you
surprised, Mr. Sutphin?

1337
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:44,879
No comment.
Beverly?

1338
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:46,878
Here I am, honey.

1339
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:48,819
Beverly, hi!
I'm Suzanne Somers.

1340
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:49,982
Hello!

1341
01:28:50,058 --> 01:28:52,993
Mrs. Sutphin, can we get a
shot of you and Suzanne Somers?

1342
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:54,756
Absolutely, stand here, Beverly.

1343
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:56,353
Guys, what about a nice two-shot, okay?

1344
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:57,523
No, Suzanne,
really, I'd be much...

1345
01:28:57,598 --> 01:28:59,259
Beverly, Beverly,
stand right here!

1346
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:01,302
Okay, smile,
Serial Mom!

1347
01:29:01,402 --> 01:29:04,337
Suzanne Somers,
this is my bad side!
